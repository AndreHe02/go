C[Hi! I'm talw playing on IGS I'm BC but it's because that's what I set myself to be all the time. The only other rank I choose can be 22k, but I'm not sure if I'm at lvl or not.

This is one of my first 19x19 games, I played a couple of games on 13x13, and then decided to try a large board game, I stayed away from it because it looked really long and boring, but it turned out to be great with alot of great moments for me.

I lost the game by quite a bit, but I think that still trying to force my way into my White's territory didn't made me lose more points, because even though he gets 1 more point for the capture, he lose 1 more point for putting another stone to eat it.
So I tried what I could.

This game had a lot of different settings and fights and I'm sure I'll find most of my flaws in here (maybe not me, but the reviewer [you\] may :D)

Thanks alot for your work!];B[dq];W[qd];B[dc];W[pp];B[jp]C[All the opening moves were pretty random reactions by me, is it okay up to now? I know there are josekis and the like, but I try to stay away from them, I don't feel like memorizing josekis if I don't really know the meaning behind the joseki's moves.


***
I once heard someone say "Memorize joseki and lose 2 stones of strength".  It's much better to understand the joseki than to simply memorize them.

When I was near your level, I found that I went back and forth between different reasonas for why I thought I was losing games.  Fuseki was definitely one of those categories.  

The 3rd line is the line of territory and the 4th line is the line of influence.  Also, the 3rd line tends to be more stable and is easier to play when you start out.  Many times, when approaching your opponent's stones, you'll want to play on the 3rd line.]
;W[cd]
(;B[bc]C[I attempted to secure the corner which will be secured later on, so is this move really helped secure? Is there a better move?

***
I'd say there's probably a better move.  B17 commits you to keep the corner.  C17 is the likely response, and you're going to end up with an awkward shape that white can keep attacking over and over again.  Typically, you can simply try to expand your corner and leave white pressured to play a stabilization move.  I'd be tempted to play F16 in response.  Or maybe agains a weaker player, I'd try E15.  I don't know if E15 is an overplay, but it's certainly aggressive...]

It really is too late.  Try to look at the weakness of both sides.  Those 3 black stones are nestled in pretty well in the middle of white stones.  Black can also possibly be cut on the other side.

Tenuki.  Look for your own big moves.  Sometimes it's good to ensure the ability to invade an area.  Of course, stability of your own stones is extremely important (so maybe C18)]

If you can overcome your fear, you'll become a stronger player.  Moves right now are worth huge amounts of points.  Invasion of the right side is *critical*]

I mean I could've just give up on the middle but I wouldn't get anything from it, I would've lost so I'm trying to take parts of the middle, and if I lose stones I didn't really lose more points because white took parts of the middle too in order to capture those stones. And heck, if I do succeed in taking something of the middle, I increased my chances of winning.


Is all this right?

You can ignore the ending where I tried stupid stuff, I think it's impossible to offer me variations which could've made me win this game from that point.

Something I learnt for myself, after I start from corners and move to the side I gotta move to the middle, instead I tried to stretch the really thin side.

I guess that if I my line of territory was on 3rd or 4th line, then stretching the sides would've been okay wouldn't it?

Again, thanks for your help!!

***
3rd line is the cut-off for getting enough profit for giving up influence in many cases.  The 2nd line is usually bad (thus it's called the line of defeat).  It's hard to maintain territory  on the 4th line and thus most call it the line of influence.  if you can hold it on the 4th line, then definitely go for it.
