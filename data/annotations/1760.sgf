C[Hello,

I (Black) played a very bad opening. Can you pls concantrate on the
opening? For the other part, there were 2 big mistakes which made me lose
the game. For parts of the game, other than the opening, pls point out the
important points but no details are required. I prefer to devote your time
to the analysis of the opening...

Thank you

;W[qj];B[qm]C[I think b would be better to play R12 and let w play R7 himself.  Then b could take sente, having taken profit in upper right.  But by playing your b R7, w makes comfortable base with R13 plus threatens further incursions at S15, not to mention that b still has an unstable stone at R7.  Compare with b R12 or even just b R13 followed by w Q8 or R7, which feels much more comfortable for b who can then play O3 or M17 .  If o responds to b M17 at K15, b can jump into corner at C17 .]
;W[qg];B[np];W[no];B[qq]C[As b I would answer the O5 contact play with either N5 or P5, possibly playing your move of R3 after w responds.  By not answering w's O5 locally, it lets w setting too easily.]
;W[qp];B[pq]C[I would consider b P4 instead of Q3.  If w answers b P4 at Q3, then B has solid P5 which works with K4 and D10 to build big influence in center, plus helps the R7 stone.  On the other hand, if w answers b P4 at P5 then b can play Q3 himself.]
;W[op];B[nq]C[i would consider b P3 instead of O3 here, since even though it gives w an atari at N4, w still then has to protect the N5 cut, plus, b's P3 removes a crucial liberty from the P4 w stones, which makes a b cut at P5 work well, since if w attempts to net by playing atari at P6 and then net at R6 , that net works if b played O3 but doesn't work if b played P3.]
;W[om];B[pk];W[pj];B[ok];W[qk];B[on]C[b ended up making w very safe here.  Suppose b had played Q8 instead of P6.  b Q8 keeps all b's stones connected and with access to the center, which means that the w stones at P4 are still unsettled.]
;W[pm];B[mo];W[nn]C[if b intends to abandon this lower right area, how about first playing forcing play at S4, and then connecting at S3 if w plays S5.   This way leaves threat of b S6, and if w protects against this, b has sente.]
;B[lc];W[je];B[le]C[instead of M15, b jumping into C17 looks bigger .]
;W[dc];B[gd]C[b only asking for trouble by jumping in where w is strong already.   Maybe b at D3 is better ?  or a reduction at E13 ?]
;W[gf];B[he];W[if]C[w might have given b more trouble by playing J13 instead of J14]
;B[hf];W[gg]C[w should block at H13 instead of G13];B[hg];W[gb]
;B[hb]C[since b escaped with H13, and B already has M15, b should be thinking about attacking the K17 w stones.  b H18 ruins b's chance to attack.   One of the things I'd be thinking about as b at this point is that I need to keep the H13 stones strong because if w gets to attack them by forming a w position out in the H10 H11 area, even if the b H13 stones make safe, the w position out at H11 ruins b's profit potential in the G8 area.   So, to  build b's profit area, instead of H18 I'd consider something like G12 hane.  If w cuts at H12, b turns at J13 and the w H12 stone ends up in b's field of influence.]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[ib];B[fb];W[ha];B[ec];W[db];B[ig]C[this b J13 not so important as long as the w stones at J18 are alive.  Even after b J13, w still has either L18 or L14 so w can answer b's J13 with F10 to reduce b.  For this reason, instead of J13 for b, i'd consider G12 hane.]
;W[jg];B[ie];W[kf];B[jd];W[kd];B[id];W[kc];B[ke]C[b stands to lose more around O17 area than he stands to gain by capturing 2 w stones at K15.  So instead of b L15, i'd play M16 .]
;W[ld];B[lb];W[jf];B[me];W[md];B[mg];W[ji]C[w is in b's sphere of influence, so instead of w K11 w would be better off taking profit where he knows he can get it, such as O18, although the w forcing play at O15 first is good too.]
;B[hi];W[ne];B[lg];W[of];B[pf]C[b's idea is good of atacking the w K11 center stones, but b loses focus with Q14.  how about b M10 instead to continue the attack.]
;W[og]C[instead of w P13, w could keep himself out of trouble with L10 .]
