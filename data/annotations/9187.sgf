C[Hello :) I'm trying sanrensei fuseki nowadays. But I think i have some problems about building moyo. In my opinion, i won this game because my opponent made a lot of small moves. But I have a lot of mistakes too ^^ Please show me all of them :) Thank you so much !!

Alex: Hello! I'm Alex, a KGS 2k, and I will be reviewing your game! :)]

[qq:B]C[Alex: This move is a mistake by white. By exchanging S4 for R3 he removes his option to take the corner later. Just jumping to A would have been better. B and C are also good alternatives.]

(;B[qq];W[on];B[mq]LB[np:A]C[Alex: This is okay, but I also like A here.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[op];B[oq];W[po]LB[qj:A][pk:B]C[Alex: This exchange was bad for White since he ends in gote. White wants to aim for a pincer around A or B, but now Black has sente.]
;B[qi]C[In here, i want to extend for life. But maybe there can be better move ? Or any preperation moves ?

Alex: No, this is good. White has missed his chance to pincer. This extension looks like the best move to me.]
;W[qg]
(;B[nc];W[qp];B[pq];W[rq]LB[fc:C][jc:B][kc:A][cf:D][oi:F][cj:E]
C[Now tenuki maybe ? There are bigger moves !

Alex: Yes, this is only worth a few points in the corner with no risk to your group at all. Tenuki! Almost any move on the top side or left side is better than answering here.]
;B[rr];W[sr];B[fc]C[Alex: Good!];W[ec]LB[jd:A]C[Alex: This is bad for white. He's giving you the perfect extension on the top side. I think he should play A to loosely split your stones.]
;B[fd];W[df];B[jd]LB[cc:B][lc:A][ci:C][cj:D]C[Is my area too open for attacks now ?

Alex: This is great for you. Yes, this position can be invaded around A, but that doesn't mean that it is bad. White has given you a perfect position in exchange for a vulnerable corner. K16 has the correct distance to the 2-stone wall on the left and works well with O17 on the right. Note that an invasion at B is still possible (but should not be played immediately) and that white needs to invest another move at C or D to complete the right side.]
;W[gp]
(;B[iq]C[Another bad move :( There must be better move, bigger move...

Alex: Your bottom right group is already completely safe. You should play on the weak side to strengthen D4. Don't worry about the territory at the bottom. You'll make up for it on the left side.]
;W[cn]LB[dn:A]C[It looks like a mistake to me, but i couldn't punish him :(

Alex: His idea is certainly good. Your corner stone is weak, so he wants to attack it. I would maybe prefer this move on A.]

(;B[co]CR[dj][dn]C[Alex: You are doing the same thing that he did in the top left. He wants the marked position, because it gives him a  really big and strong left side, so don't help him play there.]
;W[dn];B[fq];W[dj];B[eo]C[I want to cut

Alex: Good thinking, although with the solid left side it's more difficult now than before.]
;W[en];B[fo];W[ho]
(;B[jn]LB[gm:B][fn:A]C[Alex: Wrong side. K6 does not make territory on the right, so it's better to run into white's left side territory with A or maybe even B.]

(;W[hm];B[fn]C[Alex: Good.];W[hn]C[Alex: I think White is placing too much importance on those stones. It will hurt his left side territory.]
;B[fl];W[hk];B[em];W[dl];B[dm];W[cm]
(;B[hl]C[Isn't it bad move ? ^^

Alex: Yes! :) This sort of cut can work if you have strong stones on both sides, but generally you shouldn't play it unless you have carefully read the variations for both ataris and are sure that you can cut and kill.]

;W[el];B[fm]
(;W[cl]C[Alex: This was unnecessary. The cut does not work because of the extra liberty at D5.]
;B[qc]LB[oi:A]C[I want to reduce his territory and it worked. But is there any better move ?

Alex: This looks good. Although you should still play at A at some point.]
;W[pc];B[pd];W[rc];B[qb];W[pe];B[od];W[re];B[pb];W[oe];B[ne]
LB[lc:A]C[Alex: This sequence gave you a decent chunk of territory and the invasion at A is no longer possible. I would say it's a good result for you, but the right side group is becoming very weak. At some point you need to tenuki and play there before it gets killed.]
;W[nf];B[me];W[mf];B[lf]C[hmm ???

Alex: I think now it's absolutely necessary to tenuki and play on the right.]
;W[lg]
(;B[kf]
(;W[oh]C[Alex: Not the best attack. White should take your base away. See variation.]
;B[oi];W[ni];B[oj];W[nj];B[jj]C[Alex: This is not the time for this move. You need to live on the side.]
;W[kk];B[ol]C[It is not looking as a good shape o.O];W[ri]C[Alex: White is helping you more than hurting you with this move.]
;B[rj];W[rh];B[qk]LB[pj:A]C[I dont like this move :/

Alex: It looks good though. At this point living is the most important thing! This move gives you good eye shape. You can now live by playing at A.]

[ps][qs]C[Thank u so much !! ^^

Alex: You're welcome! :)

Final summary: I think you played well locally, but you should look at the big picture more often. Always ask yourself first whether you need to respond to your opponents move. If he's just threatening to take a few points and nothing else then tenuki is often a good option, especially in the early game.

Next, take a look over the board and check which groups are becoming weak and which are strong and alive. If you have any weak groups, strengthen them! Even if they can't be killed your opponent will usually benefit from attacking them, creating territory and influence during the attack.
Naturally, you want to attack your opponent's weak groups if you can.

Lastly look at open areas and ask yourself how they can be converted into territory for yourself or your opponent. That way you will find a good direction of play more often.]
