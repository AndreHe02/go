C[pierredego [8k\]: Hi!
lkjpoi [7k\]: hi

Some tactical blunders in this game. I comment on my plans and strategic aims at some key points. I'd be grateful if you could point out where I am misguided and indicate some lines of play that I have missed, that would have improved my game and been better style.

Thanks in advance and I hope you'll find some entertainement in this game as a compensation for your effort.

Pierre-Normand Houle, Black in this game.

[JB\] Hello, I have tried to review your game and analyze some positions in more detail.
Roughly, the main problem I can see is that your moves are too focused on some place in the board. Every 10 or 15 moves just stop and look for bigger moves :-) I have the same problem!
Best regards,
Jorge];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[pg]
(;B[md]C[I don't know any joseki move against this. This response seemed to maintain equilibrium.

[JB\] In an empty board, standard responses would be R10 or O16. Since Q9 is there, O16 looks good(see variation).]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[rc];W[qk]C[[JB\] I think this is overplay, white is not established, but it is not easy for us to punish him :-)]
;B[qj];W[pj]
(;B[oj]C[[JB\] E.g. you may think of atari at Q11, trying to isolate the Q13-R15 stones (see variation).]
;W[pi];B[ql];W[rk];B[pl]C[I was happy to get some influhence and sente in compensation for the stolen territory.]
;W[rj];B[rl]C[Maybe not really sente since I choose to patch my wall...

[JB\] :-)];W[kp];B[iq]C[Is my position on the right thick enough to warrant this pincer?

[JB\] I would say your pincer is not such, because J3 and Q3 are both low compared to L4. And Q3 is a bit far from L4. I would have played e.g. C6, trying to develop something in the left side, but this is personal. In this area, I think H4 looks better (not J4 because white G4 would be perfect).]
;W[op];B[pp];W[jp];B[lr]C[I thought I could maintain the connection with this move and rob White of  his base.

[JB\] It is too far. L2 is enough, but in any case, playing here keeps black low and allows white to block with J4. Anyway, white cannot expect too much here because its influence is in some way "smoothed" by black's Q8.]
;W[kr]
(;B[kq]C[This didn't work.];W[lq];B[jq];W[mr];B[ip];W[jn];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[fo]TR[iq][jq][jr]C[I have some reluctance to fix my base with a play at the marked spot, because of the empty triangle this would create. Further, I thought I could save the aji of my dead stone for a cut from above.

[JB\] That's right. Anyway, you are a bit over-concentrated here, the exchange gave you almost no territory and your influence here is almost null. And the next exchange gave white a big corner while you got nothing in exchange.
F5 and D2 look like miai (avoiding a big corner or escaping to the center).]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[dq];B[do];W[co];B[dn]C[[JB\] This one is small, and gives white an opportunity. By playing in contact, white reinforces. If you want to run out, just play F7 or F8; if you want to reduce the left side, play e.g. C11 or C12.
After F8 it may be a good time to cut at M4, though it has no easy follow-up.]
;W[dm];B[fm]C[[JB\] You are doing less than white here, he gets bigger. And white F2 would give you no territory on the bottom.
The good thing is that soon a move at M4 would be very good for black.]
;W[el];B[em];W[dl];B[fl]C[[JB\] This is what we may call "pushing from behind". If white continues e.g. F9, he is getting bigger and bigger while you turn towards yourself. If you wanted to cut at M4, you are strong enough here (again, the cut loks good but I am not sure about the continuation...)]
;W[io]TR[lp]C[This was good timing for white making shape. I was about ready to play on the marked spot and attack.]
;B[ho]C[[JB\] Still small.];W[hn]C[[JB\] I prefer F16, maybe C13, though this move is not bad I think there are much bigger places.]
;B[gn]
(;W[hm]C[[JB\] I did not like all this exchanges, because of the big left and top sides.
Also notice some weakness in the black position at H4 (variation).]

;B[ko];W[jo];B[lo];W[mm];B[lm];W[ml];B[km];W[jm];B[kk];W[ik]

(;B[ki]TR[jl]C[The moment I played this I bit my fingers for the marked spot seems much better shape and sente.

[JB\] It is "quite sente" ;-) though white could still go out because he is strong on the side (e.g. black K8 and J8, then white H8, etc). So white could play J11 or even near J16, probably (though in this case black can just push him and get profit on the side).]
;W[mj];B[ii];W[hj];B[jl];W[il];B[hi];W[gj];B[fd]TR[md][fh][hi]
[ki]C[I discontinued the attack to start sketching a moyo. I was aiming at the marked spot.

[JB\] Good. Anyway white lives at G8, but you can keep your attack while preparing your moyo or reducing white's. E.g. by playing F12 now, white would feel he needs to play with his center group, and then you can play F16.]
;W[df];B[gi]TR[fh]C[Here my plan is to press the weak group down in sente and close the moyo off on that side. The marked spot might still have been better?

[JB\] Maybe, but white still has G8.];W[fj]
(;B[eg]C[That move might have been too greedy.

[JB\] Yes... it looks like you are not sure about reducing, invading or reinforcing yourself... and did neither.
This is a good moment for counting. Let's suppose E13 is at F14... this would give white about 60 points plus komi, and black (assuming white cannot invade and live at the top) about 70 (of course this is not exact, just a rough estimate - and a lot depends on the life of the N8 group).
BTW, a black move at P11 may be big at any moment.

And back to your comment... yes. If, at this point, you would have estimated that F14 may give you a comfortable victory... why to play E13? :-)

This is important so I will repeat: in any case you are probably 10-15 points behind, so you should be conservative. You can realize this only by counting at some points in the game.]
;W[ef]C[The exchange will turn out to be a big loss for me.]
;B[ff];W[fg]C[Ive tried to resist the exchange bit this White move forces it. Or does it?

[JB\] You can play G14 here.];B[eh];W[fe];B[gf];W[ge];B[ch]
;W[he];B[hf]TR[eg][ch][eh]C[My little poke in his terrirory seems not to compensate enough for the destruction of my moyo, of my upperside and his threatening to secure a big corner.

[JB\] Completely agree.];W[ie];B[jd]TR[jc]C[I'm attempting to save a bit of my upperside. Playing one point futher up might have been more secure?

[JB\] I think yes.];W[id];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[db];W[eb]

;W[ig];B[jf];W[if]TR[jg][jh]C[I did not foresee this cutting sequence that was permitted by the gain of tempo with the atari of my marked two stones. I watched helpless the left side suffer as I saved the right side.

[JB\] Even so... see variation. C10 may be key to live here (first rule: get more eye space, second rule: play the vital point)]
