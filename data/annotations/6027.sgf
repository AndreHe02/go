C[Thank you for reviewing this game.


You'll find my comments inlined and some general remarks at the end (after move 185). I hope you'll find them useful.

Word of caution: I'm not much stronger than you, so you should not relay solely on my word. Treat my comments more like suggestions.

All my comments begin with J:];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[pn]
C[Joshua: I played this move high because I wanted to try a new joseki.

J: Trying new variations is always a good idea. I feel this kind of high approach would have been better at D6, though. That would create better balance with C16 (which is low). Now both of your stones on the right side are high.]
;W[pl]C[Joshua: I didnt know the joseki for this response though!

J: This is a bit unusual pincer. I would have expected R8, if pincer is pleayed here.]
;B[nn]C[J: Peaceful play.];W[np];B[qo]C[I didnt want him to have the option of connecting by playing R6.

J: Did you carefully consider this move first? If you are preventing a connection, it means that you want to attack Q8. But immediately after this move you play a gote sequence on the left and let white play Q11 to get a (more or less) secure group. If you plan to attack and play moves in preparation for it, you should follow that plan. If only after one move you discard that plan, it means you did not consider the plan carefully enough. Always try think at least one move in advance (this is much harder than it sounds! ;-) You'll gain at least 2 stones by doing that.]
;W[rq]C[J: Here white gets nice big corner. Before you let that kind of thing happen, you should have a plan how to get compensation for it. Your group is weak, so it is difficult to see how could you mount a serious attack on Q8, but you should try something since you started the attack. Otherwise you'll be robbed.]
;B[cn]C[J: This move is big, but since you started to prepare for an attack, you should make sure you finish here in sente in order to carry out your previous plan.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[gp];B[cj]C[J: Somehow I feel this would be better played high (D10). You already have C16 low, so D10 would combine better with that.]
;W[bo]
(;B[bn]C[J: Even if this move is big endgame move, it is far too small to be played at this stage. You let the chance to attack Q8 pass, which leaves also your Q6 group weaker. See variations.]
;W[pi];B[nl]C[Felt this would be a good way to limit my opponets access to the center while I provided an easy escape for my group

J: Yes, you certainly need to plan a way out for your group, but it would have been better to do it before white forced you to and gets to play R14 as well.]
;W[qf];B[mc]C[J: This is a bit thin and leaves room for invasion, a weakness your opponent almost immediately exploits.]
;W[of]
(;B[ec]C[J: This move is big, but the problem is it does not seal upper nor left side as both are still open for invasion. I feel it would have been better to secure upper right corner and then when white invades either upper or left side, secure the other one. See variations.]
;W[oc]C[J: Here the weakness of your position becomes evident.]
;B[od];W[nc];B[nd];W[qc];B[qd];W[rc];B[rd];W[mb];B[lc];W[me]
;B[md];W[kq];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[nb];B[qb];W[oa];B[rb]C[J: If you have a look at this position, it is obvious that the result is not good for black. Your P16 stones are very ineffective, as they are in between two white groups and do not secure (almost) any territory and the influence is not effective either.]
;W[kn];B[lb]C[J: This is huge. Should have been played earlier already. Capturing R17 stones is small compared to this.]
;W[ma];B[pk];W[qk];B[ql];W[pj];B[ok];W[rl];B[qm];W[rm];B[rk]
;W[qj];B[rn];W[rj];B[pg]C[I want to seperate his groups here

J: I'm not sure exactly what groups you want to separate (P14 from R14 or R14 from Q11). To me these groups look like they cannot be separated. You should either make reducing (sente) moves from outside and only then if white does not answer, make the actual separation. Now when you play this deep without any backup, your stones end up being very heavy and in trouble.]
;W[pf];B[qg];W[rg];B[og];W[ng];B[oh];W[ni];B[nh];W[mj];B[mh]
;W[qh]C[But he connects underneith before I get a chance.

J: Here you see that you ended up having a heavy dragon to worry about, but did not achieve anything (apart from a small points reduction. Think carefully before you invade deep in hostile territory. If you don't have a escape route or life planned, it's better not go.]
;B[nf];W[gl];B[gn]C[J: Think carefully before you make moves like this. White position is very thin, so there should be some room for either invasion or big reduction in the bottom. When you jump in the middle, you land yourself in trouble when trying to pull the stone out. In the meantime, white gets to strengthen its own positions and secure the lower territory.]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[fp];B[ep];W[eq];B[dq];W[cq];B[dr];W[cr];B[do]
;W[cp];B[fo];W[go];B[fm];W[hn]C[J: Here white has (more or less) secured the bottom side without you gaining almost anything.]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[hl];W[fl];B[em];W[gj];B[il];W[hk];B[fq]C[J: Did you read out this move beforehand? Better not to waste ko threats.]
;W[er];B[fr];W[ds];B[ho];W[hp];B[io];W[ip];B[jo];W[ko];B[jp]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[lp]C[J: Although you got some points by this sequence (in gote), white secured the whole bottom side in the meantime in sente! This is very bad for black.]
;B[im];W[jj];B[lo];W[mp];B[kl];W[lm];B[ll];W[jn];B[in];W[mn]
;B[mm];W[mk]
(;B[ml]C[J: This move seems unnecessary. There are certainly bigger moves on the board. If you are afraid of your R7 group, you can easily make it alive in sente should white cut your groups.]
;W[jg];B[mf]TR[pg]C[J: Don't know if this move is necessary, but if it is, you can clearly see what is the cost of Q13. You have to come back helping that group out even now, while you urgently need to play around D12 region.]
;W[dg]C[J: You got robbed here.];B[hd];W[jd];B[cg];W[ch];B[cf]

(;W[bh];B[ei]
(;W[eh];B[di];W[fh];B[dh]C[J: You were fortunate as white let you have it back.]
;W[ke]
(;B[le]C[J: I'm not sure what you want to accomplish with this move. O14 group and O16 group are connected anyway. You salvage some small points (again in gote!), but you should have let N15 go and get the big points by J17. A win would have been on the cards after that.]
;W[lf];B[ld];W[lg];B[mg];W[gc];B[gd];W[fc];B[fd];W[eb];B[dc]
;W[db];B[cb];W[hc];B[ic];W[ib];B[jc];W[jb];B[da]C[Maybe there is a better way to attack this?

J: Actually there's not much to attack here, as white can either live or connect easily. In terms of points this is quite big, so the move is justified.]

C[Misread this part. Thought I could cut off the 2 white stones. Thats why I made the wall on the left by sacrificing the J12 group.

J: Even if you would have captured these 2 stones, it would have been smaller than capturing the marked white stones.]
;W[nk];B[oj];W[oi];B[ol]C[J: The rest is just mainly yose, so my comments end here. I think you played nicely overall, but there are some things you need to pay attention to. (1) Before invading, plan either a way to live or a way out. (2) Think about preserving sente so that you can continue your attack after the sequence (3) always read at least one move in advance (4) try to count if the move you are about to make is really the biggest one

Anyway, I think your play has nice feeling. Just pay attention to planning and you'll certainly get stronger ;-)]
