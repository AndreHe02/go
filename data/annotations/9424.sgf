C[C: Hi, I will be reviewing this game for black as requested. I will comment on moves for both sides as we go and summarize by thoughts at the end. Enjoy!

Kuroi [3k\]: Hi
upon116 [3k\]: hi];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[nq]C[C: No strange moves so far, the opening is standard up to this point.

I feel shaky in the fuseki. I took a long break and have forgotten a lot, so I kind of just wing it/try to read.]
;B[qn]C[C: I would prefer to play at Q6 to use the power of the Q10 stone, although this is probably a matter of personal preference.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[lp]C[C: Bit strange from white, L3 is the classic shape.]
;B[de];W[dg]TR[nq][pj][pr][qn][qq]LB[lp:B][pp:A]C[C: Your "A" group is definitely more powerful, the shape is very solid. Never underestimate the influence of the triple-star opening. Conversely, the "B" group is actually not working, notice there is no good answer for a black move at F3. See the variations.

I thought I should try to get influence out of the sequence after white plays this. That's mainly because I saw white's "B" group as having more influence/center potential than my "A" group.]

(;B[fd]C[C: Don't this this is a classic joseki although I don't want to jump the gun and say it's a mistake, shape is decent.]
;W[ee];B[ed];W[dd];B[ce];W[ef];B[bc];W[fb];B[db]C[C: You're correct. Remember that when you attached like this, it needs to be a miai situation. In other words, an attachment that allows your opponent to choose the side can only be played if you're prepared to take either side.

On second thought, I think c18 would probably have been better here.]
;W[cb];B[gb];W[eb];B[cg];W[gc]C[C: Good move from white, many players would probably have played instinctively at D12 or C12.]
;B[dh];W[eh];B[df];W[eg];B[di];W[gd]C[C: White likes this exchange. D18 now looks like a serious mistake, the F16 group was very big to give up.]
;B[kd]C[C: I see you're trying to reduce the power of white's wall, but because you already have Q10 I would prefer to play a bit tighter at N17.]
;W[qf]C[C: The invasion is natural. White actually has very little territory.]
;B[qe]SQ[pj]C[C: You're right, Q10 is a natural pincer. This move is not bad, white is forced to play at either R12 or S10 rather than the preferred R11 extension.

I actually have a hard time deciding when to use these "kicks" rather than just pincering. I'm under the impression that having something like the square stone in place makes it appropriate.]
;W[pf];B[qh]C[C: This is the aggressive move, I would prefer to play O16 or P15 in sente. Attacking this group will be difficult because of the white wall.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[nc];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd];W[ld];B[lc]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[md];B[kb]C[C: Both players seems to know some uncomon joseki. However, in this case it's good for black. White is still missing any real territory and it's hard to see how to use the wall with Q10.]
;W[ke];B[kh]C[C: Bit early, it's fine to play the solid move at K16. I can't stress enough the power of the Q10 stone, it is the purpose of the triple-star opening.]
;W[jd];B[kc]C[C: White likes this exchange.];W[mh];B[je]C[C: Cut seems a bit aggressive considering the surrounding white stones.]
;W[jf];B[ie];W[lf]C[C: You've accidentally made white's shape stronger]
;B[ei];W[ge];B[dn];W[cn];B[cm];W[bn]
(;B[bm]C[C: Better to play the sente move at D5 first.];W[do]
;B[en];W[fp]C[C: This sequence is better for white.];B[fe];W[ff]
;B[fh];W[gg];B[iq]C[C: Last several moves were good from black.]
;W[kq];B[fr];W[gq];B[gr];W[hq];B[hr];W[ip];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr]
;W[cr];B[br]C[C: Yes it would be nice to keep the stones. Again, you have to consider both sides of a cut.

Really thinking e2 or e3 would have been far better.];W[er]
;B[cs];W[es];B[fq];W[eq];B[gp];W[hp];B[eo];W[ep];B[bp]C[C: Now white has made his big chunk of territory and is comfortable. Plus, L12 is in serious danger after you let white create a new wall on the bottom.]
;W[go];B[gm];W[gl];B[fl];W[fk];B[gk]C[C: You are playing actively, but white has the advantage in a fight due to the surrounding walls.]
;W[hl];B[hk];W[fm];B[el];W[hm];B[ln]C[C: This reduction is too aggressive, O5 is the natural move. You need to consider the safety of L12, creating another floating stone with the kind of power from those walls, you will have to sacrifice one for sure, and at this stage in the game you can't just sacrifice important central stones so casually.]
;W[nn];B[nm]C[C: Again, attaching is dangerous because of the walls.]
;W[om];B[on];W[nl];B[mm];W[pn];B[oo];W[pl];B[qm];W[pk];B[ok]
;W[ol];B[qj]C[C: Black loses some territory here and L12 is almost completely lost.]
;W[ml];B[ll];W[lk];B[no];W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[mj];W[kl];B[lm]
;W[mk];B[li]C[C: Bit too late to try to save this stone.];W[nj]
;B[ni];W[mi];B[lj];W[nh];B[oj];W[nk];B[oi];W[kj];B[rg];W[rf]
;B[ri];W[jh];B[qr];W[or];B[oh];W[og];B[pm]C[C: B18 is bigger.]
;W[so];B[ql];W[qk];B[ro];W[sn];B[sp];W[sm];B[rp];W[id];B[mp]
;W[mq];B[jq]C[C: It's always a mistake to try to save lost groups in the endgame like this, if you thought you had a chance you should've tried earlier and now you're just giving away ko threats.]
;W[jp];B[jr];W[is];B[kr];W[lr];B[fs];W[hs];B[co];W[sd];B[rc]
;W[gh];B[ic];W[hd];B[gi];W[hi];B[hj];W[ii];B[cc]C[C: Waiting all endgame for the B18 move and now you are giving it away to white!? Big endgame mistake.]
;W[bb];B[cd];W[da];B[fn];W[gn];B[em];W[jc];B[jb];W[ik];B[fi]
;W[ij];B[gj];W[sc];B[sb];W[se];B[rb];W[sg];B[pg];W[nf];B[qg]

C[C: Some of the key takeaways I have from this game:

1. You're right in your first point on fuseki. The triple-star opening is a pure influence-oriented opening, but you never took advantage of the third star stone. With some of your moves, I could see you were a bit scared of white's walls without considering its influence.

2. Always have to consider miai. Whenver you attach to a stone, you always have to consider that your opponent can cut on either side. Sometimes there's only one obvious side to cut, but there were a few situations here where it could've been either and it seems like you only considered one when you played the move.

3. For your point on speed, to be honest I wouldn't worry too much about it unless you're set on playing speed games. If you're really concerned, most high-dan players (just to be clear I'm not including myself in this category ^.^ ) tend to spend a long time at the "decision" point, then play the subsequent moves quickly because they've already read the variations. For true speed games, you play based on shape. Basically with experience, there are lots of shapes and combinations that come up a lot in games and once you've seen them a few times, you'll remember how they're played out without having to read into it from scratch every time.

From here my opponent got disconnected, but playing out the rest to best of my ability, w wins by about 10.5 at 6.5 komi. I would love to improve my ability to read and play faster (I'm much slower than most players) and I'm not really sure how to get over that.]
