It is better to build up a competing moyo on the top and right side.  As long as you can keep a balance, the points you gained in the lower corner will let you win.]

White seemed to lose focus after the black group lived inside the white moyo.

You must carefully look for the direction that your stones want to move in.  This makes the play flow naturally, and gaining territory follows automatically.

Also, be *very* careful about making two weak groups on the board!  Even if they look safe, there is usually a large long-term penalty.  White did not attack the weak black groups properly (again, by choosing the wrong direction), so he did not get enough benefit.

Finally, when you get a big gain like the early corner, try to keep the rest of the board in balance.  Trying to increase your lead often leads to disaster, as it could have in this game.]

(;W[hn]C[White should press from this direction, to make black run against the strong D line and to set up a splitting attack between black's weak bottom and side groups.

Always avoid having two weak groups on the board!]))
(;B[cj]C[White is afraid to play on the right side because black is strong there.  If white plays there, black will attack and make a lot of points in sente.  Therefore, black should play in another big unclaimed area and invite the invasion.]

(;W[or]C[This is the right response for white.  Giving atari out of a crosscut is usually wrong, so black should be skeptical of this play.]
;B[np];W[nr];B[nn];W[qn];B[qm];W[rn];B[pm]C[The outer influence that black gets simply isn't enough to compensate for the corner, and black has an open skirt on the side (S7).]

(;B[do]C[This feels like the most natural direction to play in.  The star point stones want to move along the edges and the 3-4 stones want to make corner enclosures, so this helps your stones do what they want and hinders white's natural development.]
