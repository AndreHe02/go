;W[qf];B[pj];W[nc];B[pf];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pb]C[R15/Q15 is more  important than here.  You aren't going to kill the corner -- and
a play at Q18 can not connect to the O17 stone -- so the most important point  in
this sequence is the mutual weakness at R15/Q15.    In fact, it is double sente, so both players should take it before most of the
other plays in the next few moves.];W[kc];B[ke]C[This should be the simple  block at K17 -- by playing up/out like this, you make it  too easy for the white group to make a base.   The sequence played along the right is supposed to give white some (small)  amount
of territory in the corner in exchange for black outside thickness.  The way  you
take advantage of thickness, is by attacking groups -- in this case the white  stones
at L17&O17.  If you play K17, they will have no base -- and they will have to  run
out into the centre, this is what you want... to chase a weak white group  into the
centre.   
In fact, L17 is a poor choice for white... he should abandon the O17 stone,  leaving
the aji behind for later, and play elsewhere.  It was a sacrifice stone to  gain the
territory in the corner inside blacks sphere of influence.];W[ne];B[oe]
C[You  are better off playing the simple connection at Q15 here -- it makes R15 far  nastier
sente against the white corner group.  White probably won't be able to play  the extension
to R13 after all, and will have to make a more conservative response, freeing  you to play
something important like (still) K17 or possibly O13.];W[qg];B[pg];W[jc]
;B[id]C[I would probably hane at J17 here.  Keep white low.];W[ic];B[lc]
C[  fmaus 23k :  risky? or a good attack?

This looks like an overplay to me.  Even if the white response of M16  doesn't work, the response at M18 is going to, and white is going to
come out with reasonable shape and eye-space, for little gain to you.

Because of the pushes at K17 and then J17, this group is solid enough
that it isn't going to die, and you might chop off the O15 stone -- but
so what?  Your best bet at this point is to try and cramp its size as
much as possible -- the hane at H17 is still probably your best choice.

(Do you sense a theme here, I keep having you try and block white's
movement towards the left.  Must be important.)];W[ld];B[lb];W[nb]C[
 JamesL 24k*: i've seen others do it];B[md];W[mc];B[le];W[kd];B[me];W[hd]
C[Ick!  Now white gets that all important hane...

And, of course, you got to experience just how painful letting white get this
move was.];B[hc]C[ fmaus 23k : oh my, why am i in this fight so soon :)

Because you made an overplay at M17...];W[hb];B[gc];W[gb];B[fc];W[jp];B
[dj]C[This should be at F18.  If white ignore, L18 kills the white group.  So,  F18 is
sente, and it seals the corner, making territory and making the black group on
the outside far more solid.  Then black can make a play on this side.

At this point, I would prefer the kakari at C6 to the D10 extension  I can't pin down why, it just looks better.  I guess D10 feels too slow.]
;W[cf]C[This is a bit of an overplay by white -- but he got away with his  last overplay
(L17) so why not try again.  If white must invade, A point like D14 or D12  is  probably better.]
;B[ce];W[df];B[fe]C[This is the wrong direction... white  can't connect to his own group on this side,
he is already cut.  And killing the stone at H16 isn't important for black --  you
don't need that connection to live on either side.  Yes, if white plays H15,  you
will have to respond (to maintain the life of the J16 stones, which is  important to
maintain the cut) but you shouldn't be playing on this side.  The move that  really
stands out to me is C12.  Then white, again, has no base and has to run with  a black
wall already built on one side... and there is even a black wall accross the  top  to prevent white escaping that way... Things get messy for white.]
;W[ci];B[cj];W[di]C[ fmaus 23k :  This doesn't feel good, have i erred?

Yes.  F15 was the problem move... I commented on it then.];B[ej];W[bj];B
[bk];W[bi];B[cl];W[he];B[if]C[ fmaus 23k :  made fast

Looks like the normal response, and looks right.];W[fb];B[eb]C[Because of the  outside weaknesses now, you almost have to play this at E13, to be able
to maintain pressure on the white C14 group.];W[ec]C[ fmaus 23k :  is this  too slow?

For white?  This is fine.  For black, well you do have to respond.];B[dc]
C[  fmaus 23k :  how do u like this, Dave? My thots as I play :)

It can sometimes be helpful -- and it saves you going back over the
game to decide what to comment on.];W[ee];B[ed];W[ff];B[ge]C[ fmaus 23k :   nervous here, but I think I can keep 'em split, or should I
even try?

Its gotten messy enough that it is hard to say... keeping them split isn't
bit importance, but it does make your thickness more solid, so it is probably
worth doing.];W[gf];B[hf];W[jj]C[This move doesn't feel right -- there seems  to be bigger stuff around.  Black isn't
going to make much territory in the centre anyway, and neither is white... so  solidify
a corner, or the bottom edge.  An extension up either side would, in fact, be  a nice
choice -- especially the left side.];B[fh];W[eh];B[gi]C[ fmaus 23k :  This  seems too cautious, but I don't know what 2 do

Way too cautious... in fact, at this point you could, quite easily, tenuki...
or if you want to continue putting pressure on this white group, E11 is a  better choice.  This move looks very odd.

And an even better choice than either outside move is a play at B14 or B15.]
;W[be]C[ fmaus 23k :  okay, this wont kill my corner because of e17 & h16  eyes, rt?
  so moved on

Yes, this won't kill your corner -- but the white group is now alive.  The  question,
of course, is where to move to.];B[dn]C[ fmaus 23k :  would r6 be better? or  f3,q3?

Both of r6 and f3 would be better.  I don't think Q3 is right,
it is too much commitment to living in corner, while the outside
is still open.  If white had a stone at Q7/Q8, then maybe Q3.

I think I like F3 best of all the choices.  With you having played G11,
your D10 group doesn't have to be shepherded all that much, so making
the tiny extension at D6 isn't needed.];W[fo];B[fq]C[Jumping in behind enemy  lines... for another fight at a disadvantage.  If you are going
to invade this side, you should start much lighter -- maybe at H4.  (Or K3  is another
possibility.)];W[hq];B[cq];W[dq]C[
 fmaus 23k :  no prob! I just didn't want u 2 think I was asking for help :)]
;B[dr];W[er]C[ flyboy 21k*: e2 wrong for him

Actually, I think e2 is probably correct for white -- but the following  sequence
has moves in wrong order by both players.];B[cp]C[This should be a connection  for C2 cutting point -- either C2, or maybe B2.
The connection, of course, threatens the cut at E3.  (Normally black connects
C2, white connects E3, then black makes the push to C4.)];W[do]C[This should  be the cut/capture at C2.  It greatly improves white's position, and is  worth more than this push.]
;B[co]C[Well, this might, finally, be bigger than  C2.];W[en]C[ fmaus 23k :  f3 bad? not sure of sit here.

But this move (E6) should still be C2.

As to F3 being bad -- I commented on it at the time, I feel it was
an overplay -- but you haven't come out of this horribly badly right now.]
;B[em]C[C2 is still bigger than this... and this move forces white to make  good shape with
F7, while leaving you setup for a double atari.  Just leave this stone (D6)  alone.
If white ataris from top, you connect, then you can connect underneath at B7  should
white try to push and cut.  And, remember if white does atari at D7, it will  be gote
because of the cutting point at E7 for you.];W[fm];B[cr];W[dm]C[ flyboy 21k*:  you got territory here but look at what w has got
 flyboy 21k*: c2 very bad

Again, I disagree with flyboy -- C2 is fine here.];B[cn];W[eq]C[ fmaus 23k  :  arg I'm blind

Not sure if this is directly on this move... but no, this is the normal
response by white to the move at C2.  And your connection at C6 was  important for the stability of the black groups as well.]
;B[fr]C[This move is  aji-keshi.  It won't work, and it doesn't gain you any points -- in fact
it loses you points by throwing away the sente hane at E1.  This local  situation is
finished.  (Bottom that is.)  In fact, you should even ignore the atari on  the E7 stone
and play elsewhere.];W[es];B[el];W[fl];B[fk]C[You shouldn't be playing these  last couple of moves -- they make 3-5 points for you,  while building a nice white wall facing a bunch of white stones.  Not a good  exchange
at all.];W[gk];B[pn]C[ flyboy 21k*: q6!! good move

Finally a comment from flyboy that I agree with.  Yes, Q6 is the right point  here.
R6 would be too low, and a corner invasion would be wrong.];W[nq]C[ flyboy  21k*: o3 too passive

Absolutely correct -- far better choices for white here would be O4, O5, or
because of the relative weakness of the black stones, white might even get
away with P6.  Actually, I quite like P6.

 flyboy 21k*: o5 good for you now

O5 is definitely the right direction for your next move -- the other  possibilities are O6 and N6.

A third option that might be interesting, would be the contact play at P4.
but I don't think it works.];B[qp];W[qq];B[qo]C[White should follow this up  with O5 -- nice shape, and grows the moyo nicely.]
;W[ri]C[This, of course, is  also big -- but can black kill the corner?]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[qi]C[R11 not a good  move.  This gains you almost nothing -- you will still be able
to maintain your connection if you play elsewhere (and if you actually need  that
connection) and anything in the area of N6 is huge compared to this.

 flyboy 21k*: L11 seems good for you now
 flyboy 21k*: to try and make some territory

L11 is too small/slow.  In fact, even N6 might not be far enough, and you  might
want to play an invasion reducing play likc M4.  In fact, M4 is looking better
all the time.  M4 is the punishment for white playing O3 instead of O4/O5.
 flyboy 21k*: r7 good point for white];W[nn]C[Oh well.  Unless you can kill  something fairly substantial, the game is over now.]
;B[li]C[Not going to be  enough, and not deep enough.  White will be happy to wall you off
with N9, and take his territory -- in fact, he is making territory faster than
you are.  You should try to play on the border of the influence at times like  this -- rather than on your side of the border.  At this point, a play at M8  would
have been about right.  (Remember my previous comments about drawing a line
between the outside posts of the wall, and play on that line.  Well, K10 and
O6 are the outer posts, and M8 is right on that line.)  Here you might even
get away with slightly overstepping the line with M7, but not much more.]
;W[lj]C[
 flyboy 21k*: m11 good, but i think L11 gets you more];B[mj];W[lk];B[ki]
C[
 flyboy 21k*: soidify bottom
 JamesL 24k*: yes, about 12k i think
 flyboy 21k*: n9 good for white];W[ji]C[This might be better played at J10 --  making white's wall stronger, and leaving the
jump in available if needed for reduction.];B[jh];W[hj]C[Black should ignore  this -- it is just white completing his wall on this side -- and black
has almost no territory to make here.  At this point, the centre is basically  finished,
there are only small moves now.  N9 is probably still a good choice, because  it is sente
against the white position -- but black can not play a gote move, since there  are  important big moves elsewhere.  For instance, S10 is large, as is S3.]
;B[hi]C[
 fmaus 23k :  too small? I'm looking at his cutting points, but still may be
2 small
 flyboy 21k*: h11 just helps white and gains nothing
 flyboy 21k*: yes];W[kj]C[White should never play this.  N9 covers this  weakness, and it is worth more.

In fact, white should never have gotten into this bad shape -- playing H10 at
J9 would have worked far better.];B[gj];W[hk];B[mh]C[ fmaus 23k :  again,  must I protect, or do I have sente?

No you don't have to protect -- white's only threat starts with J12 -- and  you can just
respond with K13, and there is no risk at all.  You are protecting the two or  so points
at J12 and J13 at the cost of sente.  Not worth doing.  N9 is still reaonably  large,
but now S10 is probably the biggest thing around.  (Though it is a toss-up  between  S10 and S3 -- both are huge, and both look double-sente-ish.)

And if you absolutely MUST connect, connect at N11, that way you severely  reduce
the value of white N9 -- N9 no longer threatens an atari, so you are much  more  free to ignore it.]
;W[rq]C[ fmaus 23k :  ouch, that's big, ain't it?

Yup.];B[rp]C[S4 is awful shape -- another reason to play S3 first.];W[mk]
C[Even without N12, you have to ignore this.  S10 is far larger -- and will be
until that corner/side is resolved.  In fact, black should be playing against  that
corner now, rather than later.];B[nj]C[ fmaus 23k :  can I hane? I don't  think so...

Wrong question.  Is this (white's move) sente is the correct
question, and the answer is no.

 flyboy 21k*: p4 is last chance to get into moyo

P4 doesn't break into the moyo -- it reduces a little, but is risky because
of the bad shape in the R4 stones.

(Proper play after Black P4 is white P3.  Now black ends in gote.)];W[qb]
C[Ooops white got here first as well...];B[qe];W[re]C[ fmaus 23k :  ko time,  right?

Nope.  Too late now.  If black had gotten to start the corner, it might have  been
interesting, but it isn't any longer.];B[rg];W[rf];B[rj];W[nd];B[nf];W[pe]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[qe]C[ fmaus 23k :  this ko sucks for me now.  No gain if I win  :(

Actually, it is about a half-point ko + sente.  Connecting is gote, but
so is cutting.  As long as you are playing moves bigger than about 6 points,
you should be entirely ignoring this.];W[bd];B[bc];W[cd];B[cc];W[de]C[White  shouldn't capture here -- it is 3 points in gote, not worth it.]
;B[pe];W[sg]C[I'm not sure white needs to play this, but he is far enough ahead that  taking the
safe play here is worth it.];B[sp];W[sq];B[nk]C[This is probably better at O8  than O9.  You end up with better shape, and I think about
a point more.];W[nl];B[ol];W[om];B[pm];W[oo]C[ fmaus 23k :  I wanted that.   Should I've played there b4 o9?

You might have played here before O9 -- but be careful, you have
some ugly shape here, especially now with the atari at Q8.  Watch
your liberties very carefully.];B[ei];W[eg];B[on];W[nm];B[po];W[pl];B[op]
C[   fmaus 23k:   desperate time call for desperate measures?

Well, this is definitely desperate measures.];W[pq];B[no];W[mo]C[Now, you should  go back and connect at P9.  You should still, barely, have enough
liberties to survive white R8, and you have made the most gain you could on  the
inside.];B[np]C[As I said, you can't afford to give up this liberty.];W
[mp];B[ok];W[oq];B[oo];W[ql]C[ fmaus 23k :  slow again? Is there a bigger  than 6 ptmove elsewhere?

Well, R8 would have been worth more than 6 points.  For you.

Also, R19 is sente, so probably a better choice.  Also, you can't connect
because it costs you a liberty.

>From careful reading, S7 works for black -- though it gives up about 2  points on
the edge.  But, there are a lot of ways to go wrong if S7 is played, and a lot
of correct moves have to be found.  (Then again, white also has a couple of  tough
plays to find even if black does make a mistake.)
