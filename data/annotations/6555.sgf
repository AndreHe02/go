C[Good day reviewer.

It might seem strange that I am putting a game up for review which I won myself.

I chose to put this game up for review is because it is the cleanest match I have had so far. My opponent has just started playing Go, and I thought him basically all I know before we had this match.

I won by 20 points. But I feel in this match I used everything that I know. So this is a solid base to work from. From here I want to improve, but I am uncertain what step to take next.

This is the reason why I submittet this game for review. I have finished taking this step, now it is time to take the next.

I will try to mark out a couple of comments where I have questions. But any other improvements I am greatfull to hear about.


RS: Espen, my name is Rex Santoro. I'm 8 kyu on Dragon Go Server (rasa). I'll put 'RS' in front of my comments. Let me say firstly, if someone higher then me suggests something different, follow it!

There will be a couple of  places where I'll comment on W since this will reveal some weaknesses in your shape. Interestingly enough, I was more impressed with W since he/she is a beginner. You taught him well.

Do you have time to read go books? If so, I can recommend, "The Second Book of Go" by Richard Bozulich. It helped me very much. If you have little time or money, then please check out Sensei's Library, http://senseis.xmp.net/, if you haven't already.

When you go over this game do this: 1) COUNT LIBERTIES AFTER EVERY MOVE. This may seem like too much work, but if you do you will jump around 9 stones quickly. A 5d told me he counts liberties. If a 5d counts them, we need to. When counting liberties the magic number is 5: if you have a group with 6 or more liberties, you are pretty safe to play somewhere else. With 5 liberties, you still need to assist that group. If your group has 4 or less, immediate attention is necessary.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[eo];B[qk]C[RS: So, you're using the Low Chinese fuseki. This is an influenced-oriented strategy. Usually beginners prefer using a territory-oritented strategy since this is easier to understand. At least, I preferred territory. If you want to continue using this fuseki, take a look here: http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChineseFuseki

The basic idea of influenced-oriented fusekis is you threaten to make a huge amount of territoy and W *must* invade (which is what you want. Strange, no?). You then make territory by attacking W's group.]
;W[jd]
(;B[eq]LB[eo:4][pq:3][qk:5][pd:1]C[I was really uncertain where to start an invasion here. If this was aggresive enough or if I overextended.

RS: As I mentioned 1-3-5 are an influenced-oriented fuseki. In keeping with this, you should not invade. Having said that I know how hard it  is to play this type of fuseki. Therefore I will comment on your B7 rather then the fuseki.

For starters, W4 is very strange for a beginner. I usually only see 6d and up on KGS play so high. This is very difficult for a beginner or anyone under 1d to play effectively. The problem with W4 is it leaves the corner very open. I would be very happy if I were playing B. See the 3 variations for other  possible ideas.

Variation a & b instead of B7 keep up the idea of creating a large moyo (potential territory). Var. c could be seen as an invasion.]
;W[hq]LB[fp:B][dp:A]C[RS: A basic idea in go is try to keep your stones connected while seperating your opponent's. Here's a good time to demonstrate that. You played at A. B can be played.]

(;B[dp];W[cn];B[cp];W[ej];B[bo]C[RS: Here's something to keep in mind. This move only helps W. You are correct that this forces W to move here and you end in sente, BUT you can later use the space at b6 to help you invade on the left side. See variation.]
;W[bn];B[an];W[bm];B[am];W[al];B[ao];W[bl];B[co]C[RS: You do not have to play here. If W, did you can easily defend. There are much bigger moves: k4, d14, k10, etc.]

;W[gp];B[gq];W[fo];B[iq]
(;W[hp]C[RS: W could have play h2. See variation.];B[hr];W[ip]

(;B[cf]C[RS: There are 2 things here: 1) After your last move, j3, you saw W was getting a large moyo. It is good that you were aware enough and saw it. Others would not have at your rank. 2) Your choice of invasion was not the best. There's a saying in Go, "Play away from strength." That W wall towards the bottom is huge strength. It looks like you're not playing close, but this is. Since W did not know how to use it, you got away from with this. Otherwise W could have given you problems and most likely got big territory too. See variation.]

(;W[gd];B[ci]C[RS: Good! Since W played g16 this is better then playing b16.]
;W[bj]C[I felt some of the points I got in this match was because my opponent was very forgiving in nature. A better opponent would easily pick my strategies apart.

RS: W was not so much forgiving as he did not know how to attack, but the result for you was the same.]

(;W[jj]
(;B[ef]C[RS: Actually playing at e15 is safe.];W[fi]C[RS: This is a forcing move by W. B needs to answer this. See the variations.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[lc]C[RS: You do this also in the lower right later on. Leaving a weak group open to an easy attack. In this case, the upper left side. Be12 (an exension of 1 line rather then a diagonal play at f12) is urgent.]

(;W[lp]C[RS: Of course W should have played at k17 since your next move takes away too much.

On the other hand, W could cause big problems and maybe even kill B on the upper left by starting at 'a'. See variation.]

(;B[jb]C[RS: If you want to play around here, I think m15 would be better for a good beginning to a B moyo. See variation.]
;W[ib]
(;B[nc]C[RS: See variation.];W[pj];B[pk]C[This move and moves around this group I was very uncertain.

When things get complicated and tactical, I tend to not play very confidently.

RS: Understandable you would feel this way. I felt the same way. One thing that helps is to read out the sequence as far as possible. In the beginning, this will be only a few moves. However, with consistent practice, it *will* improve. Don't give up. Read as far as possible every time.

Counting liberties as described in the beginning will really help during tactics.]

(;B[bb]TR[li][mi][mh][mg]C[RS: B145 is not necessary. See variation for playing elsewhere and a continuation here when W plays first. When W plays first at B145, he does not get anymore territory, not 1 point more. Therefore you can play elsewhere. For instance, the lower right corner would be very good.

Also, W can kill your 4-stone group at n12. See variation.]

(;B[me]C[RS: NO! Do not capture unless you *have* to. This is just another way of passing, meaning giving W a free move. You could have used this move to play in the lower right. If W knew more, he could proably kill the corner and win.]

Thank you in advance! :)

RS: 1) I would recommned you to look at your upper left group and the lower right group. Both were in danger of being killed. For the upper right group or any group, do not leave the edges so open but make a straight extension. Diagonal moves create cutting points which can be used against you, but straight moves are secure. In the lower right corner, B was outnumbered quite a bit. A general rule is both sides should have an equal number of stones. If W had 6 stones on the outside, then B should have 6 stones on the inside.

2) Read as far as possible every move. Reading is like bike riding, the more you do the better and easier it is.

3) I wish someone had forced me to do this when I began. COUNT LIBERTIES AFTER EVERY MOVE. This may seem like too much work, but if you do you will jump around 9 stones quickly. When you count the liberties of your groups keep this in mind: if you have a group with 5 liberties, always keep a watch on that group; with 3 liberties, immediate attention to make it safe is necessary; with 2 liberties, it's most likely dead.

4) Most likely for each of your moves, you will see a logical move. Instead of making that move immediately, look for at least 2 other moves. Do this for every move. Often I find I will see a better move then my original "logical" move. 

I hope this helps you, Espen. If I was not clear, feel free to ask any questions.]
