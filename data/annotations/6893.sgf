C[Hello, I am white and lost handily. I am curious as to why and, possibly, what my big weakness/s are that led to the result.

thanks                                                                                                                          Review by Jadoube KGS 1d]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[qf];W[mc]C[too passive for W?                                                                                                      j: This is fine]
;B[oq];W[fq]C[maybe k3 or even c10 for W?                                                                                    J: I'd have approached from the other side. White 8 invites a pincer which would work well with black's other stones]
;B[cn]C[c13 for W?                                                                                                                   J: Absolutely not. White must support his last stone , as you did]
;W[iq]C[j: White 10 might equally have moved into the corner with D2.                                                                                               Note that at the end of the game Black has all 4 corners, and didn't really have to contest then at all.  You tend not to move into the corners - at least not in this game. If you're going to let the corneres go you have to make a lot out of the centre - see later comments]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[cc]C[J: Black clearly prefers to grab corners early.]

(;W[dc]C[J: I'm not sure what you're after with white 14.  Is the plan to retain the corner or to build outside influence? Either way I think there were better alternatives.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fd]
;B[ef]
(;W[ee]C[W - maybe solidify top with g17?                                                                                J: G17 would be too timid I16 perhaps, but it lets black cut and there's three stones adrift, see the alternatives]
;B[id]C[J: OK at this point white has outside influence and black is looking to erase it.                                                                                                                                  So what is the purpose of influence? it is not to make (small) territory. The idea is to attack by driving the opponent's stones towards your position of strength. Making territory as you do.]

(;W[hc]C[W - k17?                                                                                                                       J: H17 is bad, small terrritory made while using a lot of stones.  K17 is better, although I don't like an attaching move as an attack - contact moves are for defense, attack should be more remote.]
;B[ic];W[hd];B[ie]C[J; It feels like white played these last moves to keep his group alive.  It was alive anyway. No point letting black get stronger with the last couple of moves if you intended to leave things and play on this side.]

(;W[qk]C[W - r10 better first?];B[rd];W[qc];B[qi];W[qn];B[lq]
C[J; At this point white D2 seems instinctive. It establisheds the group, moves into the corner and since black will probably play C3 will be sente.]

(;W[cj]C[W -  too slow?                                                                                                              J: I've no idea of the purpose of this move.]
;B[gf]C[W - e12 better?];W[he];B[hf];W[if];B[jf];W[ig];B[fi]

;W[ii];B[gi];W[ji];B[ld]
(;W[md]C[J; Black looks like he will live. therefore I'd play M17 to tak esome territory and remove the potion of black forming abase on the top. Let him run to safety on the side - he gets no points you get many points in the process.]
;B[le];W[me]C[W - was trying to cutoff territory around o13                                                                                                                               J: The corner was bigger.]

C[J: this is huge compared to lots of white's previous moves.  Territory is made on the edge so messing about in the middle doesn't usually become that important until the edges are finished.]
