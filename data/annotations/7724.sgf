C[Hi, this is your Reviewer TsuQ (currently KGS 6k?). As there are no comments in the original SGF file, I will simply be typing in my comments directly in this form.

I will try to focus on the opening and endgame. I will also make other comments where needed, and show variations when I see mistakes to try to give you a better understanding of the situations. I hope you find the review useful. Feel free to send me an email if you have any comments or questions, thanks =\]]

(;B[ck]C[Whenever you play a hanging connection like this, it has two costs. The possibility white will be able to peep later, say at d10, and the possible atari of the single stones. Normally this is only good if you have a special reason for playing like this.]

(;B[bf]LB[ag:1][ah:2][ai:3]C[this is an overplay. you have three liberties (places your opponent must move to capture you), and he has three liberties, you're commiting to a race you should lose (since he has the next move - see variation.)]

(;B[ag];W[df];B[af];W[ad]
(;B[ai]C[the idea of a move like this is to get a free move to close off your side, but here you need to see that after he takes you will be in atari, so you will have to play a defensive move anyway. 

It would be better here to take some big point on the board because you are basically giving up sente with this. You also lose a ko threat - this threat may be ignored later if there is a big ko being fought.]
;W[ah];B[aj];W[eh]
(;B[gd]TR[dd][eh]C[One concept in go is having multiple directions to develop your stones in so that if your opponent takes one, you can take the other. The problem with this move is that it is so close to the strong white group so it is hard to go to the left, only right, and up will be difficult because of how high and close white is in that direction. try to move so you have multiple options.]
