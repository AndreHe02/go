C[Please comment for the M3D side, although comments for both sides are appreciated.
I entered some remarks and questions in the files starting wit "MR".

WOG: Thanks for asking for this game review.  Some good things to learn here.  Here are the main themes:

- Don't attack with attach!   When you attach to an opponent's stone, except in rare circumstances, it's usually to defend, not attack.  Here, there are multiple instances where attaching is used to attack.

- There are no rules or pattern for the middle game!  You can, however, use these patterns and rules to find the one best true move for your unique game.  

- Don't kill options!  Don't invade and settle the other side.  Don't atari just to atari.  Peep just to peep.  Keep options open.]

(;W[cc]C[WOG: Too focused on territory... White did the pincer on the stone at d15, now Black has completely laid waste to that pincing stone at d12.  This is a mistake for White, IMO]

WOG: Will try my best];B[oj];W[pi]
(;B[mk]C[WOG: Leaving a cut is risky business... not that White doesn't have White's own problems, but the side is strong for White, once the middle is settled than there's a cut]
(;W[ko]
(;B[jq]C[WOG: Double meaning move locally and puts pressure on the White group; however, can't help but be a bit annoyed that it's too close to the Black corner.  If following the Four Questions: play where I/opponent is weak; away from where opponent/I am strong.  This violates playing close to your strong group.  See variation for my opinion of the best move.]
(;W[cn]C[WOG: White can't really go away from the battle at hand...  see the many variations]
(;B[jo]C[WOG: Don't touch except for defense.  Here, you are attacking the White group!  Touch elsewhere!]

(;B[cq]C[WOG: big territorially, but fixes things for White.  Possible to play otherwise or go elsewhere.  Don't give up options!  This takes territory but loses a potential attack]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fr];B[bo];W[co];B[bn];W[qg]C[WOG: Now, White gets both.  Protect the weakness of the two stones at h3 and h5, and gets the big move on the side.  Yes, you get the corner, but it's not the biggest on the board.]

(;B[li]C[WOG: dicey... not enough pressure against either White group]
;W[ji]C[WOG: Things are getting dicey for Black's stones to the right]
;B[gc]C[WOG: Forcing White to make a bamboo joint here is assuming you need more help on territory and less on attack and defense.  You need the option open to cut and get more pressure on the outside, IMHO.]
;W[fc];B[ih]C[WOG: You're weak on the other side.  Better to not force White to be strong here.  Still a potential attack below if you can disconnect the two]

The reason there's a mix between moves like the earlier shoulder hit variation and pattern moves like these is that the patterns really are good ways to Go... just don't overuse them or use them when inappropriate.  Here, the pattern is good and appropriate.]

(;B[ip]C[WOG:  Every game of Go is unique.  While there are rules and patterns, usual moves are usual moves, and don't bring out the unique moves that are possible in each game.  

Nonetheless, use the Rules of Go to help guide you.  Here, you don't want to play close the your own strength (namely, the corner).  Moreover, you want to attack the weak White group in the center.   How to play away from strength and play closer to the opponent's weakness?  Shoulder hit.

Playing here while strange, is not so strange.  It obeys the Four Questions rule (play away from strength, close to opponent's weakness) and may be the best way to go in this game.]
