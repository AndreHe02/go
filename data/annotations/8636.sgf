PW[shinnjiko]PB[teddy99]WR[4k]BR[4k]DT[2012-01-05]PC[IGS-PandaNet]C[Jay: Hello, Fred. I will review this game and see how both sides played, especially for the black side.

;B[ne]C[Jay: This move is not correct direction also not urgent. C14 stone is crying help. The reason that this is a wrong direction is that the LR corner is open, thus, even if building some strength via attacking O17 stone, not much can be accomplished. W could even ignore B's attack altogether because the upper side is wide open to W. W can get the RR corner after giving up O17 stone. W doesn't have to respond while B has no clear goal here. ]

(;B[kj]C[Jay: Up to this point to summary the last few moves. The exchange at LL corner is about even, no major errors for both sides. It makes one feels that B gained a little but not very clear. W traded the coner and some left side for the center, which reduces the B's center pontential. W appears quite comfortable . This B's move is big but still not enough. There are two open corners on the right. 

Let's estimate situation right now. Assuming the W ends up getting one of the right corner, or destroys it. B has solid 53 or 55 pts. W has about 60 pts. Without komi, B is already behind. 

Thus, this move is too conservative. ]

;W[jj]C[Jay: B has some lucky. W has made small moves to allow B slowly catching up. The biggest mistake was to easily give up UR corner while open up right side too. W also made smaller moves for B to solidify the LR corner. making it into teritory. Now, B somewhat caught up. ]
