C[*Hello. I'm Shane 2kyu AGA (3Kyu KGS -- sn = butlerGO). I'll be reviewing and my comments will have the asterisk next to them if we both have written. 

First, I'll make two general comments:
1) Size of moves is very important and many moves that were 'too small' were made. If a move is too small (e.g - yose too soon) then it is gote because your opponent will take a bigger point. (or rather he/she should) 

2) There are large territories at the end of the game, and this isn't terribly uncommon in 10 kyu games, but high level players 90% of the time do not give large territories away. They find reductions or invasions. In the late middle game there was no invasions or fights, just pushing along the already defined territory. 


First of all I would like to thank you for taking the time to review this game.

About the game:
Sumatakyo is me (black). I won the game, but only because the komi was 0.5. I would have lost at regular 6.5 komi.

In general I'd like to know what were the major moves missed. Also if any mistakes in direction of play.  I think my biggest mistake was letting white take a good part of the center. I commented a few places and would appreciate any additional feedback.

Thanks in advance!];B[pd]C[Sumatakyo [11k\]: hi gg

[fc:B][fd:C][cl:D]C[*This is normal kobayashi fuseki. Because white's position is unsettled at D4 and black is unsettled on the left (he is still open) this is joseki. 

The normal thing is for white to continue elsewhere. It is crucial to approach the C16 stone. Kobayashi fuskeki is particular so white should approach at A, B, or C. There is considerable material on why these moves are standard for white's next move which you can find easily.

Since the area around A is the most crucial that is important. Next would be the other corners. Then the right side. 

Point D is not the most big area, and it isn't severe. Moves like D can only be played in the opening if it has a very severe follow up and white needs to be careful to end sente. Here D is not actually that severe, so it is too early to start a fight for no reason. Play the important areas.]
;W[cl]C[*What you did was fine in the result.

Wasn't sure how to respond to this. Since white is pincered between two black I decided to attack. Would C4  or D5 have been better? I still haven't learned the "3-space jump"  tesujis (for invasion or defence).]
;B[dl];W[co];B[ck];W[bm];B[cm];W[bn];B[bl]C[*I think this is equal. Black has a great position on the right side, getting the shimari was very large, white's corner is big, but black has a stronger central influence. The one thing is white has sente. White must use sente to prevent shimari.

*I give a few basic joseki on how white can approach. These of course are only 3 or 4 posibilities of many.

White now has a big corner. I have somewhat of a wall. but I have a feeling the exchange wasn't even (i.e. white got more), which is why I shimari at E17 next move. ** The problem with the logic of shimari at E17 next move is that it is white's move next ! ;)]
(;W[dn]C[*This move here by white doesn't do really anything. One way to evaluate it is: "If white doesn't play here, will black want to play here?" Answer : No

But, if white doesn't approach the upper left will black play there? Answer: yes.

So the situation in the lower left becomes good for black because it ended with his sente.]
(;B[ec]TR[fd][ee][ce][bd]C[* I won't say this is incorrect, but E16 is better here. The reason is that there is more potential in E16, many low kyus don't play high shimari here because they are afraid of losing territory, but if white invades black will profit elsewhere. Also, since the left side is open to white invasion, black would rather have a fourth line stone to attack a white invasion on the left.

Furthermore, there are ways for white to make shape (sabaki techniques) against this shimari fairly easy. I've marked spots for the middle game where white can invade/reduce and make sabaki. The actual point chosen depends on surrondings. Notice with a high shimari there are less reductions but more invasions. But in this case an invasion of the corner with a high shimari would lead to LARGE secure black territory on the left.

I'm going to include some follow ups to demonstrate, although please note that these are middle game things (not yet to be played as there are large open areas left). 

I included many ways that white can make sabaki. These include clever sacrifices. I started the sequence to show some of the sabaki technique. I leave you to read out the possiblilites.]
(;W[nc]
(;B[pf]C[I like this move, but pincer is also an option.];W[dm]
C[This is an extremely small move. One of the smallest in the entire game. If black doesn't respond, and white takes those stones. it is two prisoners plus 1 territory. so 3 points. This is so small that it isn't even good until about the last 10 moves.]
(;B[cl]C[If black answers he saves those two stones and makes no new territory. So that is only 2 points. Defending the corner is worth roughly 15-20]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[jc]TR[kc]C[*This is too far of an extension. This is an incorrect move, but if black doesn't punish and white completes the shape, then it becomes good move. Black must split white immediatly.

*White needed to play at the triangle point.

This time white does a "3-space jump". Would H17 been a good next move?

H17 wouldn't be terrible, but it actually would help white as much as it would help black. black would get a small two space extension and white would fix his shape. See variation.]
(;B[qj]C[Instead of defense maybe attack corner would have been better? Also, not R10, but would R9 be better here?

*This move is correct if white played the joseki at L17. R9 is sometimes seen but it is less common that R10.]
(;W[qm]C[Nice move, but the top white group is still important for both sides.]
;B[nq]C[here P3 is fine but it is crucial for white to keep sente and fix shape up top. P3 is intention to attack, but there is no telling where that will lead. It is better for white to keep it simple and play Q3.

To play A, white would rather already have a stone around L3 so he can make black heavy and attack severely. If white has to play L3 first, black can move out and white's attack fizzles.]
(;W[oq];B[np];W[kq]C[* black response is adequate but there are other things to consider. By playing P3 white allows the corner for future invasion, if black wants to preserve this he should not attach to white stones in corner. By attaching, both groups will become more solid (which is what happend).

Hmm, pincered. Please let me know if my response was bad or if there was a better one.]
(;B[po];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn];B[op];W[pq]LB[nn:A]C[Here this is okay for Black. but he should play honte (settle shape) at A or do something to make the outside group strong. 

The reason is if they are totally strong he can fight with confidence on the bottom side, if they have any weakness, white will be able to exploit it.]
(;B[nr]C[this move doesn't accomplish much. white is settled on the right side (no way to really kill) and this only threatens a yose reduction. Furthermore, black can now be under attack

White should punish immediatly. Following at A is small, and loses sight of the bigger picture.]
(;W[or];B[iq]C[This is good but. Black would rather have a really solid position as demonstrated before]
;W[jp];B[ip];W[io]
(;B[jq]C[This doesn't do much. Black group had 4 liberties. It still has 4 liberties. White now gets to become solid. So this hurts black.]
;W[ko]C[Attach at B seems better]
(;B[fp];W[gp];B[go];W[hp]
(;B[eo]C[This was a bad idea, as I find out next move. H5 better?]
;W[fn];B[ho];W[fo];B[gq];W[ep];B[hq];W[fp];B[kr];W[lq];B[lr]
C[True, but black is happy that O4 group is safe (remember weakness at O6).  I think this is fine for black although not ideal he can still be happy. He is leading in points and white still has problems at M17.

I come out of this exchange safe, but I lose 3 stones. Was it worth it? I'm not sure. My black wall isn't of much use and I don't get much territory, whereas he gets better center influence.]
;W[pm]C[Now this is small.];B[nn]C[this move now isn't important. small again. areas up top are large.]
;W[lo]C[This move is very unclear. No new points, no influence, no attack, gote...]
;B[mn]C[Black follows along, no points, no real influence, gote. Here please take a second and view the board. These groups are settled. There is open area and unsettled group on the top. There is also open area on the left for black to consolidate (although it is gote too, but at least it has value). white can also invade or make sabaki on the left-- but needs to fix weakness up top first.]
;W[hn]C[this is very small again. is black going to be able to do anything with those stones? probably not]
;B[om]C[This actually doesn't acomplish much either. please think about points. score new points or remove/reduce your opponent.]
;W[gc]C[Yes, but white actually needed M16 before doing this. Black cannot allow white to get this and M16.
I missed this. I should have played this earlier I gather.]
;B[dg]C[This seems to score a lot of points, but there is plenty of invasion possible on the left side. B seems the logical invasion point. although others might be possible]
(;W[ld];B[qb];W[pk];B[pj];W[ol];B[nl];W[nk]
(;B[on]C[*I've included some places i'd consider. Not quite sure the absolute best point now. Also, not all the moves I show in the variation white will answer, but many are sente. 


I misread this. I though it was double atari, when it wasn't. Where would have been a good place to play instead?]
;W[ml];B[oj];W[ok];B[fl];W[gl];B[gk];W[hl];B[em];W[en];B[hk]
(;W[fe]C[This is half way between reduction and expanding white territory, but it actually doesn't do a good job of either. White needs to invade the left side. See variation. White can live easy, or reduce deep, or make a large ko. All are better than this soft reduction.]
(;B[ee]C[To touch a stone is generally going to temporarily give sente to opponent. He will choose which direction to continue. Also, he will add another stone locally which will make him stronger. This contact play isn't best. Although it might be early for yose, there are very large points available (such as p18).]
(;W[hf]C[A proverb applies here "stone touching another stone = no tenuki" this isn't always true but often it is. Here this is a type of tenuki because it doesn't directly answer the contact play. please see variation]
;B[nf]MA[og][oh][oi]C[*This just isn't the largest move. Also it is pure gote, white doesn't need to answer it. How many new points does this score? Only perhaps 3 pts (less than 5). N15 would also only score about 4-5 points. 

P18 and F18 are very large. F18 is double sente (sente for who ever plays it). P18 will not only score more points but it will erase many white points. The value of p18 is roughly 10 pts (considering how much white loses and you gain).

Maybe I should ahve jumped a greater distance? N15 maybe?];W[lf]
MA[ke][je][ie]C[This too only scores about three new points. Also again--gote.]
;B[ob]C[Good, but this ends gote. play sente endgame first: F18, S9, A7, G2... etc]
;W[nb];B[oc];W[mh];B[nd]C[In the early yose it is entirely about sente. Read out opponent's responses. Don't lose sente.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[ii]C[This seems to really expand the territory, but i think black can invade it.]
(;B[ik]C[Really try to ask, "how many points is this move worth?" throughout this stage in the game. This isn't many also ask "is this sente?"]
;W[kj];B[fd];W[gd]C[I believe there is some sucess in G15. See variation]
(;B[ff];W[ge];B[hh];W[ih];B[hg];W[ig];B[gf]
(;W[ie]C[This seems unneeded. Variations show black failure]
;B[nh];W[nj];B[ni];W[mi];B[mg];W[lg]C[In this point in the game i feel that it is just drawing out boundries. There are points where you can find 'aji' (potential) and use it to get the extra inch needed.]
;B[jl];W[fm];B[el];W[hi];B[fh];W[fj]C[I next play F9. In hindsight, I should not have responded to the cut as my black group in center isn't in danger even if I cut him off from the rest of his group.

This is my last comment as I don't see anything breathtaking happening afterwards. Of course any pointers about yose would be much appreaciated. :)

Thank you!
