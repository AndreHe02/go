C[Hi. This is my first game against someone who is not a complete newbie. I've been playing with my friends, family, and reading some books but I suspect that my playing style is purely defensive and I miss good oportunities to attack (or when I attack I make mistakes).

I'm white and the other guy (Meijin? Haha, no.) is black. I'd like to know where did I fail and what should I have done. BTW, I don't know my level, thats why I put that I'm 30 kyu.

BTW again, my comments are marked as "jm".

>OK, I've put some comments and variations to ilustrate some ideas about opening, KO fights and one to ilustrate example of snapback tesuji,

C[jm: I didn't realize that playing F1 was risky until it was too late. If black had played G1 I'd have lose more territory.]

(;B[fc]
(;W[gd];B[gc];W[hc];B[fd];W[hd];B[bk];W[ck];B[bl];W[il]C[jm: I think J2 was a bad move. I tried to capture those two stones and failed miserably. Now I realized that G1 was a dangerous gap within my formation.]

(;B[jm];W[gm]
(;B[jl]
(;W[ak];B[ik];W[hj];B[dk];W[cj];B[ij];W[ek]C[jm: Maybe I should have played at J5 to prevent black from advancing further into my territory. E3 was purely defensive but didn't achieve anything.]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[hh];W[gg]C[jm: Through trial and error I've learned that G7 is the best defense (that i currently know) for this situation. But I'd like to make sure that is a good move.]
;B[ii]
(;W[dl]C[jm: I bet D2 wasn't necesary. That black formation seemed already dead to me but I wanted to make sure (Now I realize that I could have played E8 or F9 to prevent black from attacking me).
