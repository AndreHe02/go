C[Hello EBI.

This is my first review, so it would be great, if you could help me and send a short comment wheter I could help you or what I could have made better.

By the way, it is a good idea to have a look at the game yourself first and add some questions before sending it away to a reviewer.   Let's begin...]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[gq]C[This is not a tight corner enclosure. You may have good attacking points in this corner later.]
;W[jd]C[why not];B[lq]
(;W[pj]C[This is a good position for you. Black is rather flat. But i would prefer to play on the other side-starpoint to counter the enclosure in the lower left.]
;B[qg]C[This is a very unusual approach.]
(;W[rg]C[Now, this move is not good. You can't connect your two white stones with this move and it is not a good attack on the black intruder.

Maybe your idea was to make it difficult for black to establish a position on the side, but actually you are helping him with this move.

Remeber the proverb: "Don't touch what you want to attack."

The black stone is already pincered, so there are better ways to play. I would prefer to chase black in the center while making territory. (See variation)]

;W[pc];B[rc]
(;W[rb]C[The last moves were small points. Let black take a handful of points here if he wants and play a big move instead.]
;B[pg];W[og];B[ph];W[oh];B[qj]
(;W[qk]C[If you want to press black down, move first on step further on the forth line.   Black has now the cut at Q9. This can get dangerous.]
;B[rj]C[passive];W[pk]C[good];B[pi];W[oi]C[The result of all this fighting is good for white. The outward influenze in conjunction with K16 is very big. But be aware of the cut at P10!]
;B[cj]C[big point]
(;W[dj]C[Again: "Don't touch what you are attacking"

In some circumstances this play would be good, but I think that there are better moves in this position.]
;B[di];W[ci];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[dh];B[ck];W[dk];B[dl];W[ei]
C[ You still have the advantage. You managed to build an enormous mojo.]
;B[el]
(;W[ek]C[Not good. You force black to make good usable thickness and your position is overconcentrated. It is an empty triangle. Try to avoid it. (see variation)

But I am not sure if you have to answer this move immediately. Maybe a reducing move on the lower side or solidifying the upper left side would be better.]
;B[fl];W[fk];B[gl];W[gk];B[hl];W[ik]C[You can do this earlier.]
;B[il];W[jl];B[jm];W[kl];B[hk];W[hj];B[km];W[jj];B[ll]
(;W[jk]C[This is an empty triangle. Avoid it.];B[om]C[Black tries to surround territory in the center. This is not good. Thank him and play a large move.]
;W[qm]C[There are larger moves. Invade the lower side or secure the upper left corner.]
;B[nl]
(;W[nk]C[don't touch];B[mk];W[mj];B[lj];W[lk]C[this is all dangerous, because...]
;B[kk];W[kj];B[lk]C[black has not to connect here, he could play a ko instead]
;W[li];B[nj];W[ni];B[mi];W[mh];B[mj];W[oj];B[ok]
(;W[lp]C[Generally, it is a good idea to invade the lower right, but this stone here is hopeless outnumbered and with no chance of connecting with his allies on the right. Black can thank you for this move because he will become very thick while attacking it.

Look at the board. It is divided in half, with black having a slight advantage. You should always keep the whole board in mind. There are several ways to play for you. For example you can solidify your own territory or make territory while destroying blacks. You don't have to play such a dangerous move.

Keep in mind that a play on the 4-4 point like D16 or Q4 leaves the corner wide open to an invasion.

So if you want to take away territory from black, I suggest an nothing-to-fear-invasion in the lower right corner. (variation)

There are still cutting points at L11 and M12.
And remember that the upper left side is still open.];B[kp]

;W[po];B[pn];W[qo];B[qp];W[qn];B[rp];W[ql];B[pm];W[no];B[on]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[lm];W[ln];B[kn];W[ko];B[jo];W[lo]C[This is not necessary because it does not help the white stones to live. You lost a lot of points while trying to create something out of nothing. Look at the board: black got an imense corner and additionally caught a lot of white stones.]
;B[ip];W[in]C[Black does not have to answer. Your move is not a forcing move. Black could have taken the initiative.]
;B[jn]C[But he didn't. ;-)];W[im]C[Take the initiative elsewhere.]
;B[gn];W[pl]C[Don't think that black will make dumb mistakes. You cannot save your stones.   Seize the initiative on the upper left side.]
;B[ol];W[mn];B[mr];W[ml]C[Don't hope that your opponent will make a silly mistake!  Instead save these kind of moves for a ko fight.]
;B[nk];W[ns];B[os];W[bg]C[finally];B[gc]
(;W[gd]C[At the beginning of the game there was a similiar situation. There are better moves for black, e.g. an invasion at the 3-3 point. And there are much better moves for white.   Again you help black by attaching the stone. Maybe you want to prevent that black runs in the center of the board. But he has got nowhere to run. It is therefore a much better idea to close your corner (which is still open to the 3-3 invasion) and chase black in the center. (see variation)]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[fd];W[hd];B[dc];W[cc];B[db];W[cd];B[ed];W[ee]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[ge]C[This is depressing. Because black will be alive at the top every step in the center hurts a lot.]

;W[ib];B[ga];W[ia];B[ha];W[cg];B[cb];W[bb];B[ba];W[bc];B[ca]
;W[cf]C[This move is not necessary at all. You give black the initiative.]
;B[mc]C[This should be as hopeless as the previous invasion should have been.]

(;W[md]C[but you help him again];B[ld];W[lc];B[lb];W[kc];B[nd]
;W[me];B[kb];W[jb];B[nb]
(;W[ne];B[nc];W[od]C[You see, how you help black by attaching the intruder?]
;B[ka];W[ja]C[unnecessary,];B[ma];W[kg];B[ob];W[oc]C[not necessary]
;B[pb];W[qb];B[qa];W[ra];B[pa]C[You lost a lot of points here. :-(]

;W[ah];B[bj];W[ag];B[ab];W[ac];B[aa];W[gj]C[unnecessary, you gain no points and there is no danger here.]
;B[fj]C[dito.

it is maybe your last chance to take the initiative and invade the lower left. Though this invasion -even if succeding- will not bring enough points to win.]

[ss]C[I think you had good prospects to win the game, but you failed to keep the advantage. Your invasion at M4 was very bad and put black wide ahead in score.   Then black managed to take a lot of territory away from you with his own invasions and make his lead even bigger.

As I pointed out earlier: "Don't touch what you are attacking". This is very important. You attached about six or seven times a stone you wanted to attack and therefore lost your advantage. Remember the proverb and you will surely improve.

Also try to avoid the "empty triangle".

Another point you have to think about is the playing of unnecessary moves. Your opponent thanks you and plays a big point you could have played. Don't give him the initiative so easily. Try to solve problems and get better in reading situations out. This helps you to see if you have to place another stone or if you are free to take a big point.

I hope I could help you. If you have questions, send me an email.

Maybe instead of jumping he would try to create a base at the top, but that will not be easy and you can gain a lot.]
