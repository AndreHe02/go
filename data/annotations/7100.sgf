C[This was a ranked game on KGS which came real close at the end;
it came down to a reading fight that I lost because of ko.
[m\] My name is Attila Mondik, and I will mark my coments with [m\].

It was a game where B started with the low chinese fuseki, but failed to expand his moyo. W made a heavy group which gave B the oppurtunity to attack, but B didn't profited much from that attack. Next W expanded his moyo and invaded B's one, but after he let B to form a considerable territory. The match ended with a B's failed invasion, so W won the game.]
FG[259:]PM[2];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[Here I went for mini-Chinese (which is my current favorite opening).]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[I saw a similar response to the low approach to hoshi and decided
to try it.
[m\]: This move is very questionable (it's actually wrong). The chinese opening is a moyo-oriented fuseki, black tries to build a big moyo, and then wait for white to invade into it. R14 is a move which tries to protect the corner, but there is nothing to protect, w can always slide in with Q18, or even take the corner with R17.]
;W[kc];B[dj]C[Decided to take the initiative, during which time my opponent
allowed me a huge side.
[m\] The move is ok, but your comment is not. The right side is not your territory, but just a framework. It can be invaded, erased, or limit at this stage.]
;W[jq];B[lq]C[Decided to respond to this approach since it might have been
bigger than the side (since it had the support of D4 (white #2).
[m\] this move looks slow to me, maybe is better to play one space higher. I can imagine even N4 in this position.
4 from 6 stones you played are on the 3rd line, too low. Moves on third line are safe, but without influence on the rest of the board, without real "future".]
;W[gq]C[But now white has a huge corner (albeit in gote).
[m\] no, the corner is not w's :). There are just 3 stones, having INFLUENCE, but not making real territory. In this case C3, B4 take the corner, C4 is also playable, and so on...]
;B[cn]C[[m\] maybe M5 first? D10 is high, so it is not in real danger. But this move is also playable.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[em]C[This fight I am unsure if this is favorable for white or black.]
;W[gm]C[Odd move to me; perhaps you can give me some insight?
[m\] This is not joseki. Anyway, this joseki is not good for white: he became overconcentrated, while b settled himself.
As fo this move? I can't image what wanted to do w whit this move...]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[cf]C[Now I extend my side further. He makes no incursions here for the whole game.
[m\] yes, this is a good move. Imagine w C12 insteed.];W[df]
C[[m\] same joseki, but here is a bit better. But I would think about C15, B16, F16 too.]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[eg];W[ce]
(;B[cg]MA[be]C[Too passive? Perhaps a hane at X (white's next move)?
[m\] yes, it is passive. B15 is not so good, I'd play B14.]
;W[be]
(;B[bf]C[[m\]: this is very small move by now, it is an endgame move.
Let's take a look on the table. W has more territory in the corners, and good potential on the top. But b has a very good framework which can match W's prospects. I added some variations on how should B continue.]
;W[gf]C[[m\] now a move around O16 is urgent for both players. There is the boundary of two territories, so a move here expands one's, and limit the other's . A move with double purpose, so a good one.]
;B[do]C[[m\] this cut doesn't work.];W[eo];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp]
;W[bo]C[[m\] wrong. should be at G5.];B[bn]C[[m\] it is not too late for W to play G5.]
;W[ap];B[fn];W[go];B[fo]C[Now white seems to be aiming center...
[m\] W gave you some points in present, and made you very thick. The center is not the place to play in this game. Who plays first at O15 or nearby can win the match.]
;W[fq];B[gp]C[Now begins the first major fight in the game (in which white gains two points but creates a huge wall).
[m\] W should treathen the 2 cutted stones light, there's no need to defend them, there are more urgent places on the table (o15, and the lower right corner)]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[gn]C[[m\]: but he wants to defend them. Now w has three heavy stones to save, and got nothing in compensation.]
;B[io]C[Should I have climbed? Or is this fine?
[m\] it's ok.  A fight begins, so you have to look ahead, and try to get some advantage from attacking. One idea is to try to seal in w on the lower edge, and expand your framework on the right, while attacking w's weak stones.]
;W[im];B[ip];W[hq];B[iq];W[ir];B[gk]C[[m\] wrong side. should be at L7.]
;W[fl];B[gl]C[[m\] don't try to cut, if the cut doesn't work. L7 insteed, it attacks the w stones, and it contributes to your right moyo.]
;W[fm];B[hm]C[[m\]: don't try to cut, if the cut doesn't work.]
;W[hn];B[in]C[[m\] and your "cutting" stone died already.];W[hl]
;B[jp];W[kq];B[kp];W[fk];B[gj];W[fj]C[[m\] now you have a weak group too to look after.]
;B[fi];W[jf]C[[m\] very big.];B[jh];W[qo]C[[m\] and this too. w played the urgent points, he is ahead if he can live with R5.]

(;B[pn]C[[m\] wrong.];W[qn];B[qm];W[qq]
(;B[qr];W[rq];B[pp];W[rr];B[pr]C[[m\] again, small. Q5 makes you thick, so you have a chance to attack the G7 group.]
;W[rm];B[pm];W[po];B[oo];W[qp];B[rl];W[rn];B[so]C[[m\] w already alive.]
;W[sp]C[[m\] and he lives confortably. You were too kind with him.]

(;B[kr]C[[m\] this is again small. W group in the center is weak, you should attack it, with all your thickness you have chance even to kill it.]
