(;W[ro]LB[np:A][qq:1]C[This response is also a white error. Black must immediately punish by playing A.

I am also a player who does not like to let the opponent form large moyo.
However punishing calmly the mistake of white in the bottom right corner, we see that the white moyo is still easily floodable.]

;B[lq];W[kq];B[lp];W[nj];B[nm]LB[qq:A]TR[qo][ro][op][pp]C[I think Black's strategy is to capture white stones. However it will be very difficult to prevent them from escaping to the center because of the weakness of black in A.

So I think the best choice for Black is quietly attack the white group to strengthen its position. The goal here is not to kill white at all costs, but to let him run away keeping the initiative in strengthening his own groups and easily exploit White weaknesses thereafter.

To attack a group of opponents, oneself must have a solid basis to not weaken itself.

Remember: Always attack the opponent from a strong position.]

Conclusion:

I commented more the beginning and middle of the game. Although many players play very quickly early in the game, I think it is a critical step.

A bad start and the game becomes very difficult to win. We need to know what moves must be played first.

To me, the most difficult in the beginning of the game is to choose the right sequences and the right directions for the future of the game. We must never forget that the stones have been working together for a common purpose.

If you leave weak groups, you will suffer sooner or later in the game. A good solid foundation allows progress serenely and attacking the opponent with great power.

This will allow you to progress very rapidly is to consider the outcome of a sequence. If you keep the initiative, you keep your hands on the game.

Keep in mind that your shots should always be playing for a particular reason. Ideally play shots with two goals at once, the defense and the attack to keep the initiative.]
