GC[Review by Steve Fawthrop]

AB[pd][dp][dd]C[Hi Scott, Steve.
I've added my comments. It'd be good if you could add yours, and tell me where mine are compeltely off the mark as well....
Once again thanks for the game, Scott, and thanks for the help, Steve.

ScottW: I'd just like to echo my thanks to Steve, and I'll add my comments and forward this to both Steve, and magic.  This was a fun game.]
;W[pp];B[qn]LB[jd:a][dj:b]C[magic: I'm always told that in a hdcp game, black shouldn't be shy - he is stronger than white, at least in the beginning.   ScottW:  That's what I'm always told too.  I don't play many games where I give a handicap, so this was a new situation for me.

SGF: Nothing wrong with this, but a safer strategy it to take either 'a' or 'b']
;W[mp]LB[np:a]C['a' is standard.  this leave a gap to be exploited.  However, in a handicap game this may not be a problem.]
;B[pk];W[qf]LB[fq:a][cn:b][cf:c][fc:d][nc:e][qe:f][pf:g][nd:h]
[pi:i]C[Magic: Logical place to kakari from. B should maybe have answered with a pincer?

ScottW:  I tend to like pincers, and they work well when combined with extensions also.

SGF:  of all the 6 placed B could make a kakari (a-e are the others) this is the worst.  It defies common sense to invade B's position when the resof the board is open.  The standard joseki of W5, Bf, Wg, Bh, Wi leaves W very cramped and not gettign enough out of his stones. 'a' is the best place to play, so as to use the stones already played.]
;B[pf]LB[qe:a]C['a' is better.  This move is a defensive move, not an attackign move.  W is outnumbered 3-1 on this side so B should be attacking.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qd]C[magic: this is outside the 'normal' joseki, no? What are the benefits of this ?

ScottW:  I don't know this joseki (time to study I guess :).

SGF: this is joseki, although not played very often.];B[qc]
LB[qe:a][re:b][pe:c][rg:d]C[Ba, Wb, Bc, Wd, B10 is the correct continuation]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[qe];B[oc]LB[pc:a][rc:b][rb:c]C[magic: at the end of the sequence, although B has lost some control over the corner, his wall towards the top centre is a lot stronger than with the normal sequence?

This comment is correct, but 14 should be at at 'a' so that B can answer Wb at 'c']
;W[qj];B[qk];W[pj];B[nk];W[cf]LB[oj:a]C[magic: So far, so good for B

SGF: W has to play at. To let B play there . See variation for next move.]

(;B[fd]LB[oj:a]C[See vartiation starting at 'a'.  Because of this variation, W must play at 'a' with move 19.  This sort of move must never be missed by either player.]
;W[bd];B[cc]C[B tries to avoid giving W too much influence on the left side by letting him have some of the corner.]
;W[qo]LB[ci:a][jc:b][pn:c][qp:d]C[SGF: Two comments:  Although it is not unknown to ingnore B22 it is usually better to finish the joseki by exchanging 'a' for 'b' : W still has sente.

Secondly, this move 23 pretty much forces B to play at 'c'.  But, because W3 was s 2-pts jump instead of a 1-pt jump, W is very thin if this happens.  So, W23 is better at 'd', which pretects the corenr better and does not provoke Bc.]
;B[pn];W[cn]LB[cl:a][co:1][fq:2][fp:3]C[magic: here, a pincer at e.g. 'a' seems better than letting W take the entire Left

ScottW: A pincer here seems like it might be to agressive..what is wrong with other josekis? such as 1, 2, or 3?  They seem to leave a big continuation at k4.

SGF: Because W did not finish the joseki at the top left a pincer is ideal as it attacks both the top and bottom stones.]
;B[dn]C[This is absolutely the worst joseki.  It allows W to build up a position on the left and lets him get away with not finishing the joseki at the top left.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[em]LB[co:a][cp:b]C[magic: This sequence actually helps W make a large moyo on the left.

ScottW:  that's what I was trying for anyway, so this helps me.  I think this was a bad choice of joseki.

SGF: I agree with these comments, but W must exchange 'a' for 'b' first.  Letting B play at 'a' is just too good.]
;B[fm]LB[co:a]C[Play 'a' first in sente.];W[dj]LB[dk:a][cm:b]
C[W has too many weaknesses for this.  Must hold back to 31, which prevents a B cut at 'b']
;B[fp]LB[ip:a][co:b][cm:c]C[magic: I think that this is too timid. With the strength he has on the left, a play at 'a' should be possible?

ScottW:  Absolutely, this was what I was expecting, actually, and when you played your move, I grabbed the big point right away.

SGF: Ba would not be good.  Bs shape to the left is too think and 'a' is also too close to the W position on the right.   Exchanging 'a' for 'b', then playing this move is correct. and leaves no weaknesses in the B shape.]
;W[iq]LB[hq:a][eq:b][co:c]C[magic: Just to prove a point :(

SGF: 'a' is better, as it theatens 'b', but neither player should be ignoring 'c'.]
;B[jd]C[The last big point.];W[cp];B[cq]LB[co:a]C[This is the same as the top right corner - B must play 'a']
;W[do]LB[co:a]C[Better to just simply play at 'a'.  W gains nothing by this move.]
;B[eo];W[co]
(;B[jp]LB[cm:a]C[ScottW: Probably attacking the left side is more profitable, since you already have a wall on the right...This move just seems to give me territory.

SGF: B should play at 'a'.  See the variations.];W[jq];B[ip]
;W[ln]LB[kp:a][hq:b]C[This does not make sense.  The two stones 33 & 41 are being abandoned.  At the very least W must play 'a'  to seal off the bottom.  W can also consider playing 'b']
;B[jn]LB[hq:a][kq:b]C[magic: This seemed like a reasonable sequence of moves.

SGF:  This is far from reasonable. There is a proerb which says 'hane at the head of two stones'. The 2 B and  2 W stones below each can he haned at both ends.  It edefies both the proverb and good play for both players to fail to hane.  B can consider 'b' , but at the very least should play 'a']
;W[fl];B[gm];W[he]LB[ff:A][hd:1][hc:a][oj:b]C[ScottW:  This was a move I wasn't sure about.  I know at this point I'm behind, but I think this move is too agressive, and easily cut off.  B moving to A is particularly bad for me, I think.  I played high on purpose, hoping for a B at 1, so I can wall off and make a really big moyo.

SGF:  The trouble with this logic is that if B plays as you want he gains for more at the top that W gains in the middle.   'c' is the only invasion point to consider.  Also, the statement that W is behind does not hold up. W has no weak stones but playing at 'd' you subject the stones belwo to attack.  The game is close.]
;B[hd];W[ge]
(;B[gd]LB[fe:A][df:B]C[ScottW:  This move is probably unneccesary. or at least, a move to A or B is probably bigger. See variation

SGF: It is absolutely essentail and guarantees a huge territory at the top.  In addition W has 2 very heavy stones which are doing nothing.  W47 & 49 are a disater for W]
;W[ef]C[W should just have played here in the first place instead of 47]
;B[jf]LB[gl:a][fk:b][gg:c][fe:d][gi:e][gk:f][jh:g]C[magic: W is building large on the left, B needs to do something about it, but what?

SGF:  Need B worry? Ba, Wb, Bc, Wd, Be, Wf, Bg looks much better that this move.  But B has more solid territory because the lower right is far from secure.]
;W[gl]C[Notice this is where I recommended B to plaYy];B[il]
;W[hl];B[hm];W[bq];B[br]C[magic: This was incredible. I don't know if I was short on time or what, but, really!

ScottW: yes, this was a big mistake.  I think until this point, I am somewhat behind, but this moves me into the lead.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[cr];B[eq]LB[dg:a][df:b][gg:c]C[This is now small and not worth bothering with.  The territory is open to the right and you should never defend territroy open on both sides.  B must make up for the mistake in the corner by being agressive in the center.

Ba, Wb, Bc looks right, threatening to cut ot connect out.  Ba would, of course, be abandoned, but is a thorn in W's side.]
;W[er];B[fr];W[gq]C[magic: This was the obvious move for W. B has to make sure his group will survive...

SGF: B is under no threat of death, but this moves are small for both sides.  The center and bottom right are were the territroy is.]
;B[hp]
(;W[hq]C[magic: I am not sure that this move is necessary - W stones are connected anyway, no?

Scott: I don't think so.  See previous variation. Of course, that doesn't mean it was the best move...

SGF: All os these moves are small.];B[gp]LB[go:a]C[magic: move may not have been necessary either. If W pushes, B at 'a' closes

SGF: why worry. B is out into the center anyway.];W[nj]LB[ni:a]
[oj:b][ih:c]C[magic: This is where B should have played (or, rather, at 'a'

SGF: better at 'b' , driectly threatening to push and cut. B at 'a' earlier would not be good - it does not threaten anything of W's and does not expand the center as much as W will with a move at 'c']
;B[lm];W[mm];B[ml];W[mh];B[lh]C[SGF: This move does not make sense.  It neither defends the top, nor attacks the left.]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[ko]LB[km:1][kn:2][ik:3][ig:4][li:5][kp:a][ih:b]
[kq:c][lq:d]C[magic: Thank you move.

ScottW:  Yes, this was bad on my part.  Moving to any of the marked points would have been better.

SGF: 'f' is the only play here in this area, but 'g' is bigger. W need not worry about Bh - Wi is an adequate answer]
;B[kn];W[mo];B[mi];W[ni];B[mj]C[magic: B is trying to close off the right side so that he can reduce the left, but this move is not sente...

SGF: Why try to seal the right befoire the left is sealed?]
;W[ig]LB[ih:a][ik:b][hj:c]C[magic: W gets there before B

SGF: 'a' is better because then W can answer Bb with Wc]
(;B[gj]LB[hj:A][fj:1]C[magic:  Too late

Scott: Too agressive also..possibly A is better (see previous variations)  I think A is definitely better, since any ladder is likely going to favour you if W cuts.
As it was, I felt I had to kill that stone to win.  I could not afford a defensive move like 1.]
;W[ij];B[el];W[dl];B[ek];W[hk]MA[fl][gl][hl]LB[ik:a]C[ScottW:  I recognzied 3 marked stones as the target of this attack.  Seemed like a pretty obvious defense.

SGF: This would have worked much better if, before B86, B had exchanged B89 for Wa]
;B[ik];W[hj];B[gi]C[SGF: No chance];W[ih]C[Scott: Ensures I connect to the top side, and also makes it harder for black to connect out to life.]
;B[hf];W[if];B[ie];W[fe];B[gf];W[gg]LB[kh:a]C[ScottW: For a minute, I thought this move was a mistake, but it worked out ok in the end.

SGF: it was a mistake. B has no chance of living, so something like 'a' is better]
;B[ff]C[For some reason, I didn't see the atari here at first.]
;W[ee];B[fg];W[eg];B[gh];W[fh]C[magic: B didn't see this :(

ScottW: Like I said, it worked out ok in the end ;)];B[ji];W[jj]
;B[ki];W[ei]LB[ii:A][ll:B][km:C][hh:a]C[ScottW: Likely a wasted move.  Better would probably have been a connection at A if my goal is to make sure I live there.  B and C seem like useful cutting points also.

SGF: If that is the goal than capturing the 4 b stones by playing 'd' is bestis best]
;B[nn];W[ro]MA[mm]C[magic: Before this move, the corner was still open to a sansan invasion from B, no?
Nice forcing move by W.

ScottW:  Yes. I wanted to remove the 3-3 invasion possibility.  This move also means B will respond rather than cutting off the 1 marked stone.]
;B[rn];W[mn]C[ScottW:  There are definitely bigger moves to be played here, but I wanted to keep the cutting oints.]
;B[nm];W[bc];B[cb]LB[bb:1]C[Why not at 1?  keeps more corner control, and this move doesn't get you sente.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[cd];B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[nq];B[po];W[qp];B[ii]
;W[hi];B[hh];W[hg];B[kk]LB[fk:a][fj:b]C[If B is going to achieve anything here he must  connect at 'a' first.  In fact, this move would capture the W group as there is no way for W to get more than 3 liberties.]
;W[fj];B[jk];W[fi]C[magic: B wanted to close off in sente, but in fact he was two moves behind in the semeai anyway, so W could have played elsewhere, I think.

ScotW: Yes.  But I figured I was ahead by a good bit here, and wanted to be safe.  In retrospect, this wasn't smart.]
;B[lg]
(;W[og]LB[rc:a]MA[mg][mh]C[magic: Mostly endgame from now on. B has to make up a lot of points to draw even...
Loking back, the undisputed largest point would be 'a'

ScottW: I'm not sure.  I think my two marked stones can be cut off without this move.  (See variation)

SGF: The two W stones are small comparesd to 'a'.  B has to answer 'a' or suffer a large lost.  Likewise, W has to answer Ba.  This move 134 is very small.]
;B[rj];W[ri];B[rk];W[ok]LB[rh:A]C[magic: Why this move?

ScottW: Stupidity.  I just wasn't thinking.  Not only did I not defend against your eventual move at A, but I just gave sente back as well.  Bad decision here.]
;B[ol];W[oj];B[rh]LB[rc:a]C['a' is bigger];W[qh];B[si];W[rg]
;B[sh]C[ScottW:  Why not take here?  W needs to respond to a black take, and since you are giving up sente here anyway...]
;W[qi]C[ScottW: This saves the stone, and gives a sente push later.  There are bigger moves probably, but this seemed like a gift from black.]
;B[ng];W[nh];B[nf];W[rc]C[magic: W has spotted the largest move, at least.

SGF: At last.  this move is huge.  Worth about 15pts.];B[qb]

(;W[kq]LB[lp:a][fq:b][lq:c]C[If white had played 'a', 'b' and 'c' would be miai, no? White gave away some point here.

ScottW:  I don't think so.  See the variations, but I think giving up the one stone was better than what could have happened if I try to save it with a.

SGF:  Absolutely W has to play this, otherwise B destroys the lower territory.]
;B[lp];W[lq]LB[mq:a]C['a' is better so that capturing the stone is not sente.]
;B[lo];W[mq];B[fq]C[magic: Worth roughly ten points?];W[gr]
;B[jg]LB[bb:A][ra:B][es:C][de:D]C[ScottW: A, B, C, and D all seem better, and all are sente (except A I think, but A blocks off more territory than this move.

SGF:  B is sente for W and so is biger than A, which is gote for both players.  C is the biggest because is W connects then B links underneath.]

C[magic: Was there a better way to do this?

ScottW: I don't think so.  Maybe Steve can tell.

SGF: 'a' is the safest if you can afford it.  Otherwise the only option is ko.]
;W[fa];B[fb];W[db];B[ga]C[ScottW:  Why not fight out the ko?  You are behind anyway, so I doesn't hurt you much I don't think.  Plus, I don't think I have a ton of ko threats, and you've got a bunch.  If you win, you kill the invading stones.]
;W[da];B[gb];W[jh];B[kh];W[kj];B[lj];W[gk]C[magic: wasn't this a waste of a move?
