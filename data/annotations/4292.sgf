;W[jj]C[This move threw me off

--> Don't be thrown off by the unconventional --- think how you might be able to benefit by it!]
;B[cd];W[ec];B[hd]C[-->doable, but with a w center stone in place, you may just want to extend along the left side and avoid potentially complicated fights.]
;W[cg];B[ed]C[I know you don't touch stones because it meaks them stronger, so is there a better move?  this seems to split white but the result was strange.

-->This does split white and is the standard move in this case, since it lets you mount an attack on both stones.   It is not efficient (or easy) to directly attack the other stone, when this stone can slide to c18 and live easily on its own.]
;W[fd]C[crosscut?

--> heck no.  stay solid and connected with your corner -- since w gets to play in two directions with this joseki, you want a firm, safe divide between them so you can profit from attacking one or the other.]
;B[ee]
(;W[fe]C[cut here?  I can't let white have e 14 though


--> actually, you should think about d17 here, which is huge in terms of territory and the base for the w stones.  See quick variation.  

You shouldn't be so quick to think about cuts and crosscuts just because you outnumber him in the immediate area.  A fight is not really unwelcome for white here, since his center stone may play a very significant role in any running/chasing that results.]

(;B[eg]C[--> this move seems loose and does not put enough pressure on w.]
;W[ff]C[steady play by w.];B[ef];W[fc]C[also steady.]
(;B[fg]C[seems unreasonable to expect to profit by attacking such a steady group, also considering w has a center stone]
;W[hf]C[again, nice and steady by w.];B[jd]C[Bad move.  Don't run wtih this single stone; it's not a convincing threat on such a stable group, and not big territorially since the underbelly is open and it's so close to w thickness.]
;W[ci]C[not as bad as k16, since w can slip into the corner and force b to run, making profit on the left in the process.]
;B[hh];W[jf];B[ej]C[asking w to make territory.  corner is bigger.]
;W[dk];B[dj]C[help w get stronger, doesn't help you at all.]
;W[cj]C[My attack seems misguided.  I can't seem to find the correct direction and I end up just playing all sorts of different directions.]
;B[ld]C[hard to make a lot of profit here.];W[ek]C[good for w]
;B[jh];W[lf];B[gj];W[cq]C[slow.  d6 much better, or k4, making a moyo and limiting p3 potential.]
;B[qp];W[lq]C[l3 better distance];B[jq]C[two space pincer better?

-->I'd prefer it, but either way you get counter-pincered.  w has 03 and lots of room above to run]

;W[om];B[qm];W[mk];B[lj];W[gl]C[crazy tenuki by w, since your groups are connected.  m5 group in urgent need of attention.]
;B[fl]C[should ignore w and make a big moyo on the bottom that simultaneously threatens the line-m group, then come back to seal off center.]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[fm];B[hl];W[el];B[hm]C[this should be a tenuki; right side is the biggest space, and you have a chance to aggressively make territory in sente.]
;W[qf]C[overplay by w -- ignore and attack the m-group! -- then, once you have a wall sealing in the m group, you can attack this stone.]

--> my overall advice would be to work on making sure you attack from the right directions, using the weakness of your opponent's groups to build influenc where it works best with your other stones.  In the upper left, for example, it was kind of the worst of all worlds for you.  you started out with more stones, but w got the corner and big territory on the left, and never was very weak.  In complicated situations, it often makes the most sense to go for the stablest move, and let your opponent worry about how to make the most of his complicated play or overplay.
