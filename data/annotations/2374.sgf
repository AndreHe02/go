AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[yoyoma: Well black wins by 14.5, so you played well enough.  :-)
I'll try to point out some areas were black could have improved.
The biggest strategical problem was black never attempted to attack white's o3/k4.  See move 62 for example.]

(;B[jd]C[You
should probably reinforce your wall.];W[cm]C[Yes, white exploits a weakness.
 Actually this cut is too early, white should aim at it later in the game.
 But since it's a handicap game, white must be aggressive and make many overplays
like this one and hope for the best.]

;W[fo];B[go]C[This
is a nose tesuji, but it doesn't work here.  But black's position has already
crumbled here.  You should just try to save the upper half of the group.
