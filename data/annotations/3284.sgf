C[asato: Hello. I played white. I made some (many) obvious mistakes and lost the game.
Thanks for the comments.


jlim: Hi, I will be reviewing this game.  At time of writing, I am currently 11k on KGS.  Please feel free to ask stronger players for a second opinon ^^.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dd];W[dp]C[jlim: Interesting opening, not good or bad, but favors a player who likes to fight.]
;B[jd];W[pj];B[nc]LB[nd:A][pf:B][qf:C]C[jlim: I would personally chose from these 3 options.]

(;W[of];B[ql];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[oo];W[ip];B[dj];W[ck]C[jlim: Kind of a strange move IMHO . . can allow B to develop influence (see variation)]

(;B[cj];W[dk];B[qj];W[qi];B[pk];W[oj];B[ok];W[mj];B[pc];W[qc]
;B[pb]LB[ej:A][nk:B][mn:C]C[jlim: Since this game is more of a "moyo vs. moyo" game, I think a play towards developing a moyo would be a better move than protecting the corner at this point.]

(;W[qb];B[no];W[cc]C[jlim: This invasion appears to be a bit premature . . N5 might be  a better play.  If B defends C17 point later, W can defend C3 later, so it is still an even exchange.  N5 helps to build a wall and limits the expansion of the lower right black group at the same time.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb];W[bd];B[be];W[bc]
;B[ce]C[jlim: Now W has gained about 10 points in the upper left corner, but B's influence helps his moyo greatly.  B can now use his influence to reduce W's territory as well.]
;W[lf];B[kf];W[kg];B[mp]C[jlim: O4 and O3 are in deep trouble now . . what could have been W's territory on the bottom side is now largely reduced.  Saving those stones may be possible, but most likely would not be worth the trouble.  N5 would have helped against this.]

(;W[or];B[nr];W[mr];B[pr];W[ns];B[lp];W[op];B[pq];W[ej]TR[jq]
[kq][kr][lr]C[asato: I felt it was not a good sequence, here. What should I do?


jlim: See variation for explanation.  In this sequence, B could have either created a weakness in W's moyo on the lower side or threatened to kill W's lower right group by playing at one of the marked points.]
;B[ek];W[ei];B[fk]
(;W[eg]LB[jf:A][ch:B][gi:C][bj:D]TR[cj][dj]C[jlim:
W is running towards Black's thickness . . . in this case it MAY be possible with follow up moves such as:

A threatening ponnuki and then linking to the marked stones.

B threatening to kill the marked stones before the W group is captured.  

C is perhaps a safer option, running to link up with W's group on the right.  

D has many variations, all favorable for W.  I strongly recommend viewing all the variations at least once.  

I would personally play D, and if Black responded correctly, followed it up with C.]
;B[eh];W[fh];B[dh];W[jf];B[fi];W[fj];B[gi];W[gj];B[hi];W[hj]
;B[gh];W[ii];B[fg];W[ih];B[hk];W[ik];B[gk]LB[ld:D][il:F][dm:C]
[mm:E][cq:B][kq:A]TR[ek][fk][hk]C[jlim:
Great for W.  W has many options at this point.  

A defend against an incursion into W's moyo and salvage the lower W group.  
B defend against 3-3 invasion.  
C help the C9 D9 stones and prepare for an attack on B's marked group.  (could also be played at C7, but not as tight of an attack on the marked group)
D threatening M17 next to cut off B's three stones 
E to limit B's expansion into the center, and forces the marked B group to make life locally.  (or alternatively, the double hane sequence of O9 and N8)
F is a more conservative attack on the marked group, if your concern is the center group.  However, since the center group can link to the ponnuki at L14, it is in no apparent danger.  

W can still reduce B's territory by running into it from area around J14.  

I would personally play C.];W[jk]C[jlim: If you are worried about the center group, J8 may be a better option, as it isolates the Black group grom the right side better.]
;B[il];W[nk];B[nl];W[ld]C[jlim: Follow-up with a double hane at N8 might be better.  O9's has little purpose now since B's weak group has a better chance of connecting to the right.]
;B[lc]C[jlim: If you wish to capture the L14 stone, playing L16 might be better.  (see variations)  I don't feel it is that big of a point now though.]

(;W[ke];B[kd];W[md];B[mc];W[hg];B[hf]C[jlim: Reducing B's territory is not a major concern at the moment . .  . either not allowing B's weak group to link to the right or securing territory along the lower left or lower right side would be a better option.]
;W[gg];B[di];W[ij];B[ff];W[gf];B[ie];W[he];B[if];W[gd];B[hd]
;W[ge];B[gc];W[em]C[asato: Here I tried to take a big point, but I lost almost everything.


jlim: I am guessing because your C9 D9 stones got under attack?]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[dm];W[cm];B[dn]
(;W[co]C[jlim:
You managed to save your C9 D9 group, but now the B group looks as if it can make two eyes locally.  Not sure if you were looking to attack or run with E7.  D7 is a one point jump good for running, but it serves a dual purpose by also limiting the B group's eye space.  Even if you can't kill it, you can be sure of territory on the side.  

As a side note, B5 may be a better option in linking W's weak group to the corner stone as it leaves less aji .  See variations.]
;B[do];W[eo]TR[bk][bm][cn][en][cp][ep]C[jlim: A little pre-emptive of an attack here . . lot of cutting points.  Perhaps a safer option would be to connect at C6, let B live locally, and secure the territory along the bottom side.]

(;B[cn];W[bn];B[el];W[en];B[ep]C[jlim: Watch out for the double atari.]
;W[hl];B[cp];W[bo];B[dq];W[fp]C[jlim: Black can now get two eyes in the corner.]
;B[fo];W[go];B[fq];W[fn];B[gq];W[hq];B[gp];W[fo]C[jlim: Small note, H5 instead of F5 might be better.  The F5 stone isn't really important.]
;B[hp];W[ho];B[io];W[im];B[gm];W[in];B[iq];W[jo];B[jp];W[jl]
;B[io];W[hn];B[kn];W[mq]C[asato: Could I save this group?


jlim: Highly doubtful at this point, you need N3, M2, and M1 to make two eyes.]

Late Opening / Early Middle Game:
When looking for moves in the middle game, I would suggest to consider looking for moves that emphasize more of a moyo rather than solid territory.  IMHO it is analogous to playing on the star points in the opening, rather than opening at 3-3 points for solid territory.  

Middle Game:  Don't neglect your weak groups!  Consider sacrificing them if you feel they may be a burden to save.  When running, try to run towards one of your own groups in an attempt to link up, and keep your opponent from linking up as well.  Remember that a 3-3 invasion is a trade of territory for influence, so try and visualize the outcomes before invading.  If there isn't a lot of territory left for your opponent to gain with a huge wall, THEN an invasion might be favorable.  When attacking a group, your intention is not always necessarily to kill it, simply to chase it around while gaining territory and/or influence.

Endgame:  Watch out for groups along the edge that only have two liberties.  

I learned from reviewing this game, and I hope the reader of this does as well ^^.]
