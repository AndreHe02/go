AB[pd][dp][pp]C[I'm dbstraight, playing white. This game was played on KGS. I play very few games against handicaps, so I am certain there are many mistakes in my general technique. Any advice in that area would be extremely helpful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I will review your game just from White's point of view. I have commented on certain moves and have given you some tips at the end. Don't be too concerned about playing a handicap games. Play lightly and don't get too caught up in defending what you think is your territory. Outline some territory, but keep playing in open areas to make sure your opponent doesn't get them instead. 

Overall, White's play was too timid and included too many "thank you" moves that got no territory but instead just helped black. The whole time, there were many big moves left on the board. Always keep in mind that if there aren't any groups in danger of dying, you should be looking for big points on the board.

See the variation.];B[el];W[ej]C[The idea behind this was to build up more strength toward the top and then jump into 3-3 and make a living group.]

;B[fc];W[dg];B[db];W[gc]LB[kc:A][nc:B]C[I recently saw this move in a pro game, and it seemed quite aggressive, and thus fitting for a handicap game.

-------

It's good to try new things, but this seems inappropriate in this situation. You're still far behind on handicap so you want to start a fight, but just not here. Black's two stones aren't completely settled just yet, and white's formation in the top left corner is relatively solid. Possible alternatives are to play around A or B. A with the intention of making things difficult for black's left group, while making a base at the top; B with the intention of claiming some territory in the other corner.]

C[I'm not sure thaat this is necessary. If black tries to cut, white can catch it in a ladder with D13. Better to start looking for big points, or looking to start a fight somewhere. A to C are worth considering.]
;B[gb]C[Very small move.];W[fb]C[Unnecessary response. There are bigger points on the board. You still need to catch up on handicap.]
;B[eb];W[fd]C[Black should just capture if black wants to play locally. However, it is already alive and should probably tenuki.]

[ab][bb][cb][fb][ac]C[This seems ok. Black lives very small.

-----------

Black made a mistake and got sealed in. However, black actually has around 11 points. That's a considerable amount of territory. In exchange, white got no solid territory. The group at the top is connected, but still open on the right, so there isn't much territory there if black plays around A.]
;B[ed];W[ee]LB[fe:A]C[Black should not play here immediately, but should be aware that A is possible in the future if the opportunity to take advantage of the cut arises.]
;B[jp]LB[nq:A][qq:B][pr:C]C[Good big move, marking out territory. Every move that marks out moyo like this makes it more difficult for white to invade. However, A to C are still possible.]
;W[nc]C[At this point, I think an invasion is starting to look like a good idea, but this is not a bad move. It tries to map out some territory on the top while putting pressure on white's lone stone in the corner.]
;B[pf]C[However, this still helps black mark out potential territory.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[ld]TR[kc]C[Looking to build up a nice position on the top. Perhaps L17 instead.]
;B[ib];W[ha]TR[ic]C[Maybe allow black to connect for the sake of maintaining influence.]
;B[ic];W[hc];B[jd]
(;W[if]C[Use the attack to build up strength on the left.

This makes white extremely overconcentrated. White is using many stones to surround a relatively small amount of territory.]

This will nullify any potential that the marked stones may have (which were already a mistake). Maybe try something in the lower corner. The stones still have some aji, and in the future may be able to do something.]

;B[pn]C[This probably deeper into black's territory than I could've hoped to invade, but it still doesn't do much good if I can't kill anything or get another invasion in. Black is at least 75 points ahead here.

--------

This is a result of white trying to snake through territory that isn't even black's yet and thus forcing black to build up a strong wall and get territory in the center.]

;B[bk];W[nq];B[mr];W[sr];B[rs]LB[ff:A][kn:B]C[I think instead of trying this method of invasion, I should've just jumped in somewhere along the bottom and hoped for the best. At this point, certainly the game is lost.

------------

You seem very concerned about developing your own groups and trying to somehow tear apart what your opponent has. There is a proverb that says to play away from thickness; this includes both your own and your opponent's. In this game, you kept playing close to your own stones, and not only did you not profit from it, you helped black increase his own strength.

Just take a quick look and compare your territory at A, and black's territory at B. A is overconcentrated and didn't benefit much. In comparison, B played stones further apart and got more territory. 

This problem of getting overconcentrated is especially dangerous when playing against a handicap. Black is already at an advantage, so getting heavy and overconcentrated just makes it an easier game for black. Keep an eye out for the big points on the board. A hint: look for the big open spaces. When you're behind, you be seeking out profitable fights.

When there's a lot of room, you can and should invade. In this game, it just looked like you were too afraid to approach black's stones which seemed to outnumber your own. Play normally anyway. Even if you don't have any special strategies in a handicap game, play normally and eventually you'll start to catch up. There is a reason why there is a handicap in the first place.]
