C[Hi,

I play as Numsgil on KGS (2k currently).  I'll mark my comments with a 'N' just to keep things neat.

Don't give up during hard fought battles.  A lot of the battles you lost were winnable right up until the bitter end.




Dear Reviewer,

It would be nice if you could make a more or less review of both sites, because I asked my opponnent and he will receive the review after it is finished
right in the start a heavy fight took off, mainly I think because of some mistakes I made, I would like to hear something about them

At the very beginning took a heavy fight off, in my opinion, due to some mistakes I made, when you could say something about it, I would very apreciate it. My opponent will also receive the Review, therefore if you could make a more or less review for both side it would be very nice.

After the fight, although I had caught a group, Black still led, and then I made many mistakes which ultimately made ??it impossibleto win, so I gave up.

I have also added comments and questions along the way.];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[qd];W[dp]C[OD: Normal Opening I guess?

N: Nothing weird so far];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[od];B[pf];W[lc]
;B[cf];W[ch];B[cc]C[OD: Was the pincher already in this situation a mistake?

N: I think this is okay.];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb]C[OD: Was it a mistake to answer this? Maybe I should have played somewhere else on the board? And let black crawl on the second line? But when yes, where and why?

N: Even though it's on the second line, this is a pretty important move to answer.  White has good prospects on the top, and black will be more than happy to ruin it all if white doesn't block.]
;B[cb];W[dk]TR[fc]SQ[ic]CR[qn]C[OD: Should it had been around J17? I was afraid of a black Invasion there.

N: I'd play triangle.  It's an important point because it turns the top in to a source of strength.  Without it, it's a source of weakness, or at least potential weakness.  It might feel a little slow, but it's really important to not leave weaknesses.  Square might look tempting, but the white stones on the left are not very heavy, and could be sacrificed if needed.  Directly strengthen your heavier stones.

N: If we pretend that the top is okay for now, I'd play circle.  The left side can't be turned in to solid territory in a single move, so it's fine to leave it for now.]
;B[jc];W[ke]TR[fb]CR[hc]C[OD: I learned to play invasions against the wall, but maybe in this situation with the possible cut at E17 I should have played from the wall? Like on H17 or HG17? And when yes, what should black have done else? Or is this a good invasion anyway for black?

N: Black should have played something like triangle, and directly attack white's weak stones.  He's attacking light stones.

N: As white, there are a couple if different ideas for what to do here.  You can play like you did, with the intention of sacrificing your wall on the left to build a wall in the center.  The problem is that it's tricky to turn a center facing wall in to points here, because the right side is a black moyo.  So as white I'd be inclined to try and protect the left stones first and foremost, and attack black's stone secondarily.  Which means playing at circle.]
;B[gc];W[fb]TR[fc]CR[ec]C[N:  I'd play triangle as white.  You're not going to kill black, but you can force him to live small.  And you can get some shape for your wall, too.

N: As black, I'd play at either 24 or circle.  Black's lone stone is light, so he can treat it as an asking move.  Then he can directly dive in to attack white's wall.]
;B[ge]TR[fd]CR[ec]C[N: Triangle is better.  That's a shape point (to make a mouth shape) for white.  And it threatens the cut at circle.  So it forces white to either sacrifice stones or get really bad shape.  Either is good for black.]
;W[id]TR[fd]C[N: Triangle is still a good move.  It's sort of a peep, and helps protect white's shape.  26 here is the wrong direction.  It just forces black to run toward the left and damage white's other stones.]
;B[ic];W[hd];B[gd]
(;W[df]C[N: See variation];B[hc];W[if];B[kd];W[ld];B[je];W[jd]
;B[kc];W[ie]TR[jf]C[N: Triangle is better.  This way leaves bad shape and too many weaknesses.]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[jg];W[hg]TR[ig]C[N: You're in a fight, don't back down.  Triangle threatens black with a ladder, takes away one of his liberties, and adds one to your own group.  This diagonal move is too soft, and loses you momentum in the fight.]
;B[ih]TR[le]C[N: You force white to separate your stones.  That's not good.  Triangle cannot be captured in a ladder, and threatens to capture two cutting stones of white in a ladder.  So that's the way to go.]
;W[fg];B[lb]TR[le]C[N: I'd still play triangle here, but it's not clear to me if black can live either way.]
;W[mb];B[la];W[ia];B[gb];W[ga];B[ec];W[fc];B[ed];W[fd];B[ee]
;W[fe];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg]TR[eh];W[dg]C[N: I'd consider playing triangle and sacrificing the string of white stones on the left to secure and gain thickness on right.]
;B[eh];W[gh]CR[gi]TR[fh]C[N: Take away black liberties by playing at triangle, or form a net by playing at circle.  This half-way move does neither well.]
;B[fi];W[hi]TR[gi]C[N: Take away liberties, and form a solid separation of black's stones.]
;B[gi];W[hh];B[hj];W[ii];B[ji];W[ij];B[jj];W[jk];B[ik];W[hk]
;B[il];W[gj];B[fj];W[fk];B[dj];W[cj];B[ck];W[di];B[ej];W[ek]
;B[dh];W[cg];B[bj];W[ci];B[bi];W[bf]TR[ce]C[N: Triangle is more interesting.  As long as your stones have three liberties, you'll win the capture race and be okay.  So with that in mind, don't be afraid to push things a bit.]
;B[ce];W[bh]TR[cl]C[N: Attack everything by playing at circle.]
;B[ah];W[bk];B[cl];W[aj];B[qi]TR[le]C[OD: Fight is over and I guess black is great in lead? After this I made terrible mistakes one after the other. Where should I have played? Or already give up?

N: The weakness at triangle is still glaring.  If white protects it, he's well in the lead, since the top black stones are all dead.  If black attacks it, he can probably save his stones and attack white's stones in return.  But even then black only manages to catch up to make the game even.  The board as it stands, with it being white's turn, favors white by quite a bit.]
;W[qq]TR[le]CR[qn]C[OD: I think this was a terrible mistake, I was just so lost, and did not know where else to play.. so I gave black a wonderfull wall and myself very little territory, after this I think I should have given up.. hope you can give me some hints

N: Leaving aside the weakness at triangle, this invasion is okay if you have a plan for sente.  Otherwise I think the invasion at circle is better.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]
;B[qn];W[kk]TR[me]C[N: Play at triangle.  Then you're winning by a lot.  If you play here, you have a weak and heavy group in the center of a black moyo.  It's a desperation move that isn't necessary.]
;B[li];W[mk];B[mc]CR[li][jj][ji][ih][jg][jf][je]C[OD: Great cut from black, should have maybe defended it instead of the 3-3 point : /

N: Yes, defending it was important.  Your best bet at this point is to sacrifice the top to build a wall to attack the circled stones.]
;W[md]C[N: Good.  Use the top stones as a sacrifice.];B[nc]
;W[nb]C[N: Good.];B[oc]
(;W[ob]TR[pc]C[N: Bad.  Play at triangle.  See variation.];B[pc]

;W[nh];B[ng];W[nf];B[og];W[ig];B[jh];W[pe]TR[mi][ne]C[N: Triangle gives you the most liberties and the best shot to win the capture race with the center stones.]
;B[of];W[qe];B[ne];W[rg];B[me];W[oe]C[N: This doesn't do anything.  It's like a pass.]
;B[qf];W[rf];B[rd];W[mf];B[nf];W[re];B[dm];W[em]TR[en]C[N: Triangle is better.]
;B[dn]TR[dm][cn][em]C[N: This rips in to white's shape.  The marked stones form a "ripped keima".  It is bad for white.]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[oi];B[pi];W[qg];B[mj];W[pg];B[mg];W[kj]TR[nj]
C[OD: Mistake.. black was alive anyway.

N: I'd play triangle.  Even if black manages to live, so should your white stones on the right.]

C[N: Play at triangle, or all the last few moves were meaningless.  You can't leave weaknesses behind.]

N: Try triangle.  It separates black.];B[br];W[cr];B[cs];W[ap]

(;W[aq]C[N: No, you lose the fight this way.];B[ar]C[OD: finally I gave up, should have done that earlier and don't waste my opponnents time, but I learned much I think, and maybe you can teach me now much much more :-)

Thanks in advance for the review!

N: This fight was winnable.  See variation.])
(;W[bs]C[N: Try this.  It sets up a shortage of liberties so black can't atari you.]
;B[as];W[aq];B[ds];W[dl];B[bs];W[cm];B[ar];W[ao]))
(;W[pc]C[N: The basic idea is to form a loose ladder that doesn't work.  Black will win the race, but not without giving you forcing move after forcing move.]
;B[ob];W[pb];B[na];W[nd];B[ma];W[pd]C[N: White forces black to take the stones, then goes back to defend.  Black still needs a move to form two eyes at the top, and then white can start seriously injuring black's position in the center and right side.]
))
(;W[hc];B[gb];W[hb];B[ga];W[ef]C[N: White can separate black, and force his eyeless group to run in to the center, and rescue his weak stones, too.]
