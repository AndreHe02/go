 BlackCat 4k*: hello];W[pq]C[

 Niall 4k*: hullo

 Niall 4k*: #bow#];B[dd];W[oc];B[qd];W[pf]LB[jc:A][pe:B]C[EE: White seeks an early fight. An extension to around 'a' or pressing at 'b' are less hectic ways of playing.]

(;B[pc]LB[pe:A][qe:B]C[Niall 4k*: is entering byo-yomi

EE: This is bad, since it helps White to mend the thinness of the "great slant" while surrounding Black. It seems Black would do allright by accepting the challenge and play as in the variation. Or, if he lacks confidence in the variations, 'a' or 'b' give a sufficient result.]
;W[od]C[

 BlackCat 4k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[qf];W[qg];B[qe];W[og];B[ph]C[EE: A thank-you move.]
;W[pg];B[rg];W[rh]C[EE: This is possible only because of Black's recent peep.]
;B[rf];W[qh]C[EE: Enclosing the opponent in such a complete and thick way this early in a game is *very* advantageous.]
;B[jd]LB[jp:A][pn:B]C[EE: Black used his sente to extend towards the thickness at the top, so now White should try to develop his thickness into a moyo on the bottom right quarter. 'a' can't be bad and 'b' is perhaps also interesting.]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[dr]LB[jp:A]C[EE: This is the wrong direction! White should play on a grand scale to get full value from his thickness. 'a' looks much better. White's two low stones fail to have much impact on the moyo and Black, wisely enough, tenukis.]
;B[qo];W[qm]MA[dr]C[NM: I felt I should pincer as close as possible, to use my TR thickness. Or should I have taken R4?

EE: Right, a wider pincer would be too inefficient here. R4 might also be playable. White has already lost some of his advantage due to the low marked stone far away from the action. It still looks like a good game for White, though.]
;B[qq]
(;W[pp]MA[fq]LB[hq:A][cq:B][kq:C]C[NM: Is this the best answer?

EE:  This isn't bad, but the triangled stone is low, so the moyo potential on the bottom is not so great. Another problem here is that Black might steal sente (I don't know this joseki very well) and reduce the value of the white wall by playing a-b-c or something similar. When Black settles in the corner, the white thickness facing down the right will not be so useful anymore.

Maybe it is possible to play as in the variation.];B[qp];W[po];B[pr];W[or]
;B[qn];W[pn];B[pm]C[EE: Considering all the white thickness, this feels like an overplay.]
;W[ql]C[NM: Should I have taken S7 instead?

EE: Though question... it is above my competence to say.];B[om];W[qr];B
[rr];W[ps];B[rs];W[ok]LB[nn:A][mn:B][rn:C][ro:D][rm:E][sp:F]MA[ql][qm]C
[NM: I felt an attack on the Q7 group was needed, but I wonder if this was the right one.

EE: 'a' or 'b' to make profit seems better. The idea is the usual one: chase your opponent towards your thickness (a worthless area to play in) in order to build up the bottom (fertile area).

The marked stones should be allright: c-d-e is sente as is threatens to kill with 'f' and White is thick above.]
;B[mn];W[lo];B[nk];W[oj]LB[nj:A][nl:B]C[EE: Considering the very strong position White has around here, this feels too submissive and overlaps with the thickness above..
Wa or even Wb can be considered.];B[np]C[NM: The B stones seemed to be just not quite thin enough to attack inside.]
;W[mq];B[ln];W[ko];B[cf]LB[jm:A][kl:B][ll:C]C[EE: Black grabs a big point and leaves his weak group behind, saying to White: "Attack me if you can!" Well, attacking the group is easy, but making considerable profit from it isn't.

Black has around 18 points in the right corners and White maybe 16 in between. Black's framework on the left can easily turn into a territory that matches White's bottom one.

With Black's center group weak and White being thicker, it should still be a better game for White, but it isn't as clear-cut as it seemed after the sequence in the top right in the beginning.

Ba is a good point, so Wa directly is tempting,
but White has other plausible attacks, like 'b' and 'c', so it might be aji-keshi.]
;W[fc]C[NM: I felt I had to do something!
I thought about C10, but with solid low stones on both sides I didn't think much good would come of it.

EE: Agree.

NM:  Besides, K16 was still quite weak.
Would another attack have been better?

G16 seemed a bit insipid, yet looking back afterwards maybe it would have been better.

EE: Isolating K16 is the right idea, but G16 (or even H16) looks more interesting, since it puts more pressure on the Black stone, offers it less base along the edge and keeps further away from Black's relatively strong corner. One plan is to try to chase K16 out to the center and then make a double attack against it and the other weak black group.]
;B[hc]C[EE: Good! This makes Black a great deal stronger here.];W[fe];B
[gd];W[fd];B[eg];W[fg]LB[gf:A]C[NM: A good reply?

EE: Pushes Black along the 5th line, helping him to make territory out of the left side. I'd say 'a' is more normal.]

NM: This was a bit bold, but I felt H14
wouldn't put enough pressure on the K16 group.

EE: DefiniteIy too bold, but it is very difficult to find the right moves for White now. Black can play at 'a' any time and secure his group.]

;B[ii];W[kd]C[NM: Maybe it would have been better to leave this attack till later ...

What would have been a better move?
L13?

EE: Most urgent is to get G13 out. The  game starts to get very messy here so it is hard to give reliable comments.]
;B[kc];W[je];B[id];W[fj];B[fi];W[gi];B[hh];W[hi];B[ij];W[hk]LB[gk:A]C[EE: Black has two weak groups in the center. White should try to get a chance to split them apart with a play in between.

The played move induces the following secuence, which helps Black to join his two weak groups. Therefore, 'a' might work better.

But, it is a confused position and it is very hard for me to say what looks best.]
;B[ik];W[hl];B[il];W[ej];B[hj];W[gj];B[hm];W[fl]LB[jm:A][im:B][kl:C]C[NM: Should I have taken D18 here?

Or indeed C17?

EE: C17 isn't connected with the big dragon, so it is out of the question. D18 is possible, I guess, but making shape (at #90) has the advantage that White can aim for a-b-c attempting to split Black's center groups later. Of course, there is no guarantee that Black answers 'a' with 'b'.]
;B[db];W[gb]C[EE: Why? B can't watari (connect under).];B[ld]C[NM: I thought about abandoning L16
and playing L13,  but it seemed too big.

EE: The shape after connecting is so bad and it is suffering from acute damezumari, so thinking twice before connecting is recommeded.]
;W[ke];B[mf];W[kg];B[mh];W[ki];B[hb];W[lh]C[NM: Maybe a more conventional move like L9 would have been better...]

C[NM: Should I have taken J4 instead of C12?  It seemed to me risky not to make sure of eye space for the L group, and it was also quite big.

EE: This seems good, aiming at Wa. If you  tenuki, Bb seems to kill. Black should defend at 'c', forcing White to live with 'b'.]

(;W[qr]N[perhaps?];B[pp];W[oq];B[rq];W[rr]C[EE: This is not joseki, but White might just get away with it due to his strong surroundings. Black's group stays weak, which should mean that White's thickness will be useful and that White can look forward to making territory at the bottom while attacking.  Please notice the idea of chasing Black up, out and running though an area where White is strong.

Letting Black settle (by yielding the 2-2 point to him as in the joseki) would seem too mild.]

[qc];B[qf];W[of];B[qh];W[mb];B[ld];W[oh];B[pj];W[lg];B[jd]MA[dd][pq]C[EE: This is only one of the thousand variations, but if we use it for reference, we find that in the fight between the two baseless groups, Black's marked stone is of more use to Black than the marked white stone is to White. Thus, this single variation suggests that the taisha might not have been White's best choice and that Black would have done well by accepting the challenge. But, taisha is taisha, and White had maybe something up his sleeve, so you never know what can happen...]
