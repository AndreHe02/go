C[EK:  Hi!  Thanks for reviewing the game.  I'm playing black against a regular opponent of mine.  Please review the game for both sides.  I feel as if I was in deep trouble in the early to middle of the game, but a mistake on Geoff's part pushed the game to my favor.

First if the first time I've requested a review; thanks in advance for your time.

I'll proceed my questions with an "EK"

[DP Hi Eric - my summary follows.  There are lots of other comments throughout the game:

1: Look after urgent points before going after big points.  There were two critical junctures at P3 and C5 either of which would have turned the game

2: Learn the 3-3 point invasion joseki and its variations - this is much more fundamental than how to respond to the Chinese opening

3: Stay connected, and separate your opponent where possible.

4: If your opponent has a weak group, attack it and take territory almost accidentally, rather than playing tenuki

5: Be aware of the approximate score - this should guide you as to whether to play defensively, or to attack\]]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic]C[[DP Have shown main joseki which arise from playing at E16 or E17.  In short, play E17 if you're going this way, but there is nothing wrong with R14 either\]]

(;W[qf]C[EK:  Would an approaching move against C16 be more regular?  Or is attacking the 4-4 the proper response to the low Chinese?

[DP The difference is tiny, so do whatever feels most comfortable.  If you play at E17 or E16 you are likely to end up with the josekis shown, of which E16 is particularly uncomfortable because of the J17 stone\]]
;B[pf];W[pg]
(;B[of]C[[DP Alternative josekis for B  would have been a simple response at O15, or to play the tsuke-osae as in Section 26 of "38 Basic Joseki" from the Elementary Go Series\]]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[qi]C[[DP Feels tight - would prefer R10 particularly since Q4 is in place\]]
;B[md]CR[nd]C[EK:  Should this be at O16?

[DP To be absolutely solid, yes.  But these are 1-point matters\]]
;W[cj];B[jq];W[hq]C[[DP This is from the correct direction - push against the stronger side\]]
;B[mq];W[mo]C[[DP Whoa!!  That is some overplay.  W is not that strong in the corner yet.  This move doesn't really threaten B either\]]

(;B[qq]CR[or]C[EK:  Would an extension of P2 be better?

[DP Yes.  B gets lucky because W blocks from the wrong side allowing connection\]]

(;W[qp]C[[DP Wrong direction because of N3 and N5 stones - see previous comment.  Would be correct normally\]]
;B[pq];W[op]C[[DP P3 is huge now, and omitting it against a stronger player would have cost you the game.  Assuming it was in place, then where is the best place to attack?  C12 is not a bad place to start\]]

(;B[cq]C[EK:  I know that my opponent should welcome the 3-3 Invasion, but I wan't sure where else to attack.

[DP Cripes!  Make sure your defence is in order before attacking.  P3 is absolutely huge\]]

(;W[cp]C[[DP Luckily for you W follows you around the board here!\]]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr]C[[DP W should not offer this joseki to B with H2 in place and a B position at K3.  B should leap at the chance to sacrifice the corner and take the ponnuki\]]

(;B[bp]C[[DP This is quite a big mistake.  You'll gain a lot by knowing the 3-3 invasion joseki and its main variations\]]
;W[bo];B[ap];W[ao];B[bq]
(;W[dr];B[cr];W[es];B[ar]C[EK:  Is this group too small for the influence White gains in the Southwest?

[DP Yes.  B has been well and truly stitched up!\]];W[ed]C[[DP Again a huge overplay.  The defensive hole at C5 in particular needs attention!  All W needs to do here is to play at C6 and B is in trouble\]]
;B[de]CR[dc]C[EK:  Looks odd in retrospect.  Perhaps C17?  I think I was trying to keep him separated from this southern stones.

[DP Check out variations from move 5 earlier.  I'd go with E15 as B here\]]
;W[ee];B[ch];W[eg]
(;B[dg]C[[DP This is a small move and does not achieve much.  You can afford to lose C12 if needed. Cut at C5 - you'll enjoy it, honest!  Other possibilities here are P3 (obviously), K5, J15 etc.\]]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[kd]
(;B[ie]CR[kc]C[Perhaps L17 instead?  I felt it was too passive.

[DP This is the correct move to show some fighting spirit and to use the strength of the tsuke-nobi you built earlier\]]
;W[kf]C[[DP Now is the time, around move 50, to do a quick estimate of the score.

B:
TR   30
BR  20 (if P3 played)
TL   20
BL     5
so approximately 75 points

W:
CR  50 
CL  30
so approximately 80 points

so it's very even.  If B attacks the weak L16 stones, then he will inevitable erase one of W's areas and take the lead whilst securing his own stones\]]

(;B[nk]CR[ig][mg]C[EK:  Was this the right time to tenuki?  If so, was this a reasonable move?  It seems that, in retrospect, J13 would have been wiser.

Given that the intent of this move was to pervent White's east from getting too large, was there a better move?

[DP Another overplay.  Just keep running with the J15 stones - W is under huge pressure here.  Attack his weak groups and the territory will come naturally.  W is weak with his L14 stones, his E15 stones and the C5 cutting point\]]

(;W[mh]C[[DP W should have capped at J13.  There are a whole sequence of strange moves in this part of the game, whilst there are still big points lurking around the board at P3, C5 etc.\]]
;B[ni];W[nh];B[jj];W[jh];B[ll];W[pl];B[pj];W[oi];B[oj];W[qj]

(;B[pk]TR[qk][ol]C[EK:  Empty triangle.  I think I was thinking that I could for GW to choose between being poked at R9, or letting me have an eye at P8.

[DP  you know they're not right, so don't do them!\]];W[ol]
;B[qk];W[ql];B[rk];W[oq]C[[DP Hurray!  Someone noticed it at last...\]]
;B[or];W[nr];B[pr];W[mr]
(;B[jo]C[EK:  Knowing now that the R3 group dies, was it better to have the K3 K5 stones, or the corner group?

[DP you know the answer - P3 was huge earlier and should not have been omitted - but probably better to save the corner and then run with the K3 stones\]]
;W[ho];B[kn];W[lp];B[in];W[kp];B[jp];W[hn];B[hm];W[im];B[il]
;W[gm];B[hl];W[gl];B[co]C[EK:  Based on the proverb that a turtle back is worth 50 points.  I was still under the impression that the R3 group was still alive, and that this would strongly damage GW's largest chunk of territory.  Given my mis-analysis of the southeast, is this a good move?

[DP  yes, it's a good move.  It's huge\]];W[cn];B[do];W[kb]
;B[mb];W[rp];B[rq];W[rr]C[EK:  I should have stopped here...

[DP ... yep - they're always good as ko threats\]];B[rs];W[qs]
;B[qr];W[ss];B[fc];W[eb];B[ec];W[dd];B[df];W[bm];B[ep]C[[DP Another count around move 100

B:
TR  20
BR    0
TL   15

so approximately 45 points

W:
CR  15 (S9 has reduced it substantially) 
CL  15
BR  20
BL    5
so approximately 55 points

so B playing in the centre rather than attacking the weak groups has caused him to fall further behind\]]

[DP Yes.\]];W[fm];B[dl];W[cl];B[em];W[eo];B[dp];W[en];B[dn]
;W[go]C[EK:  DGS did not capture our comments at this point.  GW recognized this as a huge "opps".  This error was worth more points than the difference in scores.

[DP It's not that big.  Currently W has 3 points of territory there: after capture B has 2 prisoners, and 2 points of territory, but loses sente.  So it's a 7 point gote move\]]
;B[fn];W[gn];B[fo];W[hp];B[ii]C[[DP ...err, if you do this, you must then play J14 afterwards\]]
