C[D: Thank you for taking the time to review this game. It is the first one I have submitted. I started playing more heavily recently, and I was doing great up through 11k+ on IGS (won all my games as an 11k and 11k+). However, at 10k I'm finding I can barely keep a positive win ratio! I am not sure if I have gotten worse, or if I'm just having bad luck... but if you could point out where I could focus my studies, maybe I can get back on track.
I decided to use this game because I felt it was characteristic of my playing level lately. While I did not make many major mistakes (I saw), I do feel that many of my choices were poor and worse yet, that the game seemed to follow my opponent's pace and plans.
I have added a number of comments, but feel free not to respond to them unless you think it especially important to do so.

P: Hi Destinate! My name's Peter. I play on kgs as petition 3-4k. This is a good game to have chosen to submit for review, you're right. It is mostly a pretty even game, and yet white ends up getting the best of you. In this review, I will use w to mean white, and b to mean black. I mostly try and use english terms wherever decent ones exist, but any terminology I might use that isn't clear to you can be found on senseis.xmp (search sensei's library)

In this review, I'm going to focus on understanding thickness and moyos. This is because you mention these things a few times in your comments. I think you're right on to be looking at these concepts in your games, and that by improving your understanding of them a bit, you could quickly improve your win-ratio. I found your strategic sense to be mostly much stronger than your opponent's, and you lost mostly from unsatisfying fight results, so I'll comment on that as well.

All right! Let's go!];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj]
(;B[qn]C[P: The variation on this move connects to the comment on move 9.]
;W[qg];B[jq]C[P: Pretty solid so far, nice regular opening. In my opinion, r6 is a wishy-washy stone though. If your objective was to enclose the corner, r5 is stronger. If your goal is to pressure r10 (which I think it was), r8 is stronger.

Check out the variation on move 7 for a more ambitious opening that follows the same idea.]
;W[cj]C[P: Ok, so b played pretty conservatively on their last move, with k3. Now w is indicating their decision to play for a big moyo as well. This move invites b to play in on the left side, around c14 or c6, so that w can attack.]
;B[jc]C[P: And so b answers by sketching out a large framework as well. W must now decide if they think they can win in a contest of moyos.

Again, for b, this move could go further, out to f17. W wants a peaceful game, and it's good to not let your opponent have what they want. But this is a good move though, it just forces w to make the first move to break the peace.]
(;W[nd]C[P: The purpose of this w move is to prevent b from forming a moyo. But it's a bit misguided. As you probably know, an extension from the front of an enclosure, as b has on the bottom. This is because the upper b position is flat, meaning it will have a harder time building a large moyo. B's position on the bottom is not flat, and lends itself well to building a larger moyo, with a move around k5 for instance. wp5 is a better point for reducing the framework, and, since r6 is further from q3, w p5 also makes wr5 dangerous. 

See variation.]
(;B[pf]C[D: My thinking here is that letting W get a large moyo facing his left wall would be too much, so I was hoping to use a leaning attack to help attack his O16 stone. When his O16 stone runs, I could the wall formed around K17 to offset the left W wall.

P: W's left side isn't a wall -- it is at best a framework, which is not even a moyo yet. Your biggest priority here ought to be keeping all your stones connected. A w wall in this area is trivial, since the bottom is better for a moyo anyway. See variation.

This b move invites your stones to be cut, or to become heavy, as happened in the game.

The left side is still extremely open, there is tons of room for a black invasion to succeed. It is not yet a strong position, it is just laying out the groundwork for a position later on.]

;W[oe];B[pe];W[qc];B[rd]
(;W[rf]C[D: W P18 here would have been better? This keeps his weaker group weak. I think I got lucky in this corner, considering.

P: Yes, you're right, w p18 here would have been better. But better yet, w should be thinking about sente. You've probably heard the term sente, but it means leading the play, making moves that your opponent must respond to and controlling the flow of the game. Here, w ends in gote because of this unnecessary connecting move, gote being the opposite of sente. W needs to keep the o17 group from coming under attack, so a move around l16 is urgent. W could hold back p18 for an emergency gote eye later.]
;B[ob];W[nb]
(;B[lf]C[D: Is this the wrong direction to attack from (should have pushed him toward my strength)?

P: Great job taking sente here! Getting this attack against w was huge for b. That said, you're right, this isn't the best way to attack. It forces b to run towards the k17 stone, which is weak and lonely right now. This gives w the chance to counter attack.

see variation.];W[kd];B[jd];W[ke];B[je];W[kf];B[fc]C[P: Good move!]
;W[jf];B[df]C[D: Would F15 be the better move here? I end up giving W what I was afraid of him having - a large left-sided territory. It feels like I should have been able to punish his tenuki here, but is it wrong to try with my weak K17 group there?

P: w's move wasn't really a tenuki anymore than was bf17 -- bf17 was making a base for the k line stones, and wk14 is w being sure to have access to the centre. It is a humiliating move, but w had to do it, otherside they might have been closed in. 

I think the second approach with d14 is a very strong move, and a good way to exploit the advantage you have. The k17 group isn't weak right now, so it's fine to play this way.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[cc]C[P: Nice, good playing.];W[cd];B[dc]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[gc];W[hf]C[D: Looking at the board now, I see a huge white moyo forming. He has a strong upper wall facing a left side that doesn't have enough room for one of my groups to settle in. I feel that my moyo is full of holes and can be invaded because of the R10 group. How do I find the key points in a board like this?

P: You're right, the w framework on the left has the potential to b quite large. However, it's important to remember that b has been controlling game for the last many moves, b has in some ways chosen this position, and b has sente now to continue calling the shots. This w move was another move that w was sortof forced to make, playing to link up the weak group. It leaves a cutting point around g14 though.]
(;B[cn]C[D: In retrospect, playing on the third line was foolish, right? Considering my main worry is center moyo. F4, or even D6 would be much better, I think...

P: the third line is fine here, this is a safe and solid way to play. b is far ahead and is dominating at this point. See the variation for a different idea.]
;W[dn];B[cq];W[dq]C[D: White C4 would have been much better for him, am I right?

P: Yup, this is quite a bad play by w.];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[do]
;B[cm]C[P: the usual move here is b7, to remove any aji around the cuts at b4/b6. this aji gives you some trouble later, so best to remove it immediately.]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[dk];B[dl];W[el]
(;B[em]C[D: I would like to avoid starting battles near his moyo (he is sure to get a lot of solid territory after this), but during the game I felt I was behind and needed to do something to prevent a move like White - K9 (which would frighten me if he had a secure D3 group.
In retrospect, would K5 have been better? If he ignores the cut for one more turn and plays around Tengen, then my cut threat has only gotten stronger. If he defends against the cut, then I could take a move at Q8 or around Tengen and have a large moyo myself, plus a starting point to threaten his moyo with.

P: By my reckoning, you are way ahead right now, and there is no need to start any kind of fight.
As for solid territory, b has
14 in the upper right
19 on the top side
12 on the lower left
Then, on top of that, b will probably get something in the lower right.

In contrast, w has only about 10 solid points in the group on the right side and that's it. W is the one who must at this point find a way to attack and make up ground. B could simply play a move like k5, then smile while w sweats trying to figure out where to find some points.

But if you did want to keep the offensive, then a better way to do that is to play a reducing move around e12. See variation.

 This b move is quite bad, probably the first really bad b move of the game, and it's what gives w the opening they use to win. With this move, b creates a weak group where before there was none; b gives w the chance to extend along the bottom in sente, rather than fortifying their own position there;  and it abandons using the cut-aji around g15 to reduce w's moyo.]
;W[fl];B[fn]C[P: now poor b has to run while w expands their moyo in sente.]
;W[go]C[D: He is sure to escape it seems, and I can't see how my running stones will serve to strengthen any of my territory, or serve to cut away at his.]
;B[fo];W[gp];B[fp];W[fq];B[gn];W[ip];B[in];W[jp]
(;B[lq]C[P: Better for the weak group to jump. see variation]
;W[iq];B[jr];W[er];B[lo]C[D: Some consolation...

P: This is a big point, but running with the j6 group is more urgent!]
;W[jn];B[jm]C[P: this move pushes w towards you moyo and leaves you with a cut point at j7. Better to jump with h8, which also reduces the w moyo.]
;W[kn];B[jk]C[P: the cut at j7 is still possible, careful...]
;W[cr]
(;B[bq]C[P: hmm, you could just block... see variation.];W[br]
;B[ap];W[ar];B[aq];W[im];B[hm];W[il];B[hl];W[io]C[P: best to simply connect and keep b split. The proverb says  -- Keep cutting stones alive!]
;B[ik];W[hn];B[gl]C[P: because of the j6 capture, b was forced to make this unhappy shape.]
;W[fj];B[jl];W[in];B[gj]C[D: Better than I could have expected, and still not all that great

P: yeah, this is ok! w didn't go that severe on you, and even did you a favour with f10, making their territory much smaller than it needed to be!]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[ej];B[hi];W[gh];B[hh];W[hg];B[bc];W[bd];B[bk]
;W[bj];B[rl]C[P: good sequence here, grabbing all the big points.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[jh];B[ki];W[hj];B[ij];W[gk];B[hk]
;W[ii];B[ji];W[ih]C[P: Now it's easy to see why e7 was such a bad move -- what does that b group accomplish? It controls no territory, it threatens no white group. The w territory at the top left is so large exactly because that b group is so weak, and and b's area at the bottom was reduced as well.]

[mc][qi][rg][rh][ri][sf][sg][sh][si][sj]C[D: Overall, the feeling I get from this game is that I somehow gave myself a disadvantage early on, and the only way I was able to win by even a small margin was through some lucky breaks. If you could give me one or two concepts to focus on for a while in my games, I will do my very best to learn as much as I can from them.

P: This game deserved to be yours, and it was only because of some errors on your part that it was close at all. Those errors seem to have been caused by you thinking you were behind when you were ahead -- this can be easily prevented by learning the difference between territory, moyo, and area of influence.

An area of influence is like what w had on the left side early on, or what b made on the top and bottom. It's not secure and is still very open, but the player has committed some stones towards building a position there, and has more influence in that area than the other player.

Moyo, or framework, refers to a loose net of stones around some part of the board. Unlike an area of influence, a moyo aims towards eventually converting some part of that to teritory (area of influence is much more flexible than simply aiming for territory)

Territory refers to parts of teh board that are so firmly controlled by one player that they can't be significantly reduced, and will count towards their score at the end of the game.

From your comments, it's clear you were very concerned about the left side becoming territory, when in fact it was not yet a moyo. Some rash invasions were played that strengthened w and allowed them to make a comeback.

Another thing to think about is counting -- try and always be making quick estimates of how much territories are worth, and always know who is ahead on solid points. This information will be invaluable when deciding if you should invade, or simply expand your own moyo and wait for your opponent to attack.

If you have any other questions, drop me a line, or message me on kgs.
