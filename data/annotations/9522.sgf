C[Hi, 

I'm Karin, I'm about 11 kyu and I'm reviewing your game. I hope my comments will help you and are not too confusing. If you have any questions about them, just mail me or ask me on KGS (JoeT) when I'm online.

A few general comments:

a) You have some good instincts and moves. 
You just need to see them trough to the end. It's much better to play at a situation until you are satisfied, that everything is safe and secure than to leave things unfinished. I know it is hard to judge such things in the beginning, but it is even harder to have several open situations on the board and judging which one has the highest priority right now.

b) I'm sure you know basic concepts like a group needing (at least) two eyes to live. You have to remember that theses eyes need space. If you don't have this space, run to and connect to another group which lives or is more likely to live. And surely you know it's much easier to have this "enough space" in the corner or at the edge. 

c) About the Empty Triangle: It's a bad shape with few liberties. Try to avoid it. A 1-space jump works just if not better in most situations.

d) It would have helped me a lot if you commented on you moves, not only if you had specific questions. Sometimes it is essential to know what your intentions are when playing a stone. Even if I can guess it most times, it would help a lot.]

;W[dc]LB[dd:A][fd:B]TR[cd][ed]C[Two possible cutting points (A,B) in minimal area. => The marked stones are weak and should be reinforced! 

Playing at A would make them really strong and B wouldn't be very threatening after that.

Look at the possibilities after White played A. It's always to your disadvantage!]

;W[oq];B[jq];W[hc]C[Now, he's attacking you weak stones. Very hard to get out of there. It won't be pretty, and it will be bad for you.

Here you have a choice: 
- Either try to save those stones. But I'm sure white will gain much territory and strength while you have trouble getting them to live.
- Or letting them die while using them as a threat to gain something while you are playing elsewhere.

HOWEVER 
Since you have just started playing Go, either way you are probably in way over your head.  So ignoring the situation and playing somewhere else might be ok if you get something out of it.]

(;B[fn]LB[cj:C][rn:A][mr:B]C[Overplay. Your stones are very concentrated in this area while the rest of the board is still open. (Not forgetting the unattended and still weak stone at the top.)

If you are not comfortable with wide jumps like C you can simply secure your territory with A or B.]
