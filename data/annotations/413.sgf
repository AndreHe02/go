WL[31];B[pk]BL[42];W[nc]WL[27];B[pf]BL[38];W[kd]C[White seems a little tight here. K16 is feels better, but it's probably fine.]
WL[15];B[jp]BL[35];W[dj]WL[1];B[fq]BL[2];W[hp]C[This is almost definitely bad for white.  This is the wrong point to attack the this black shape.  There are usually three points of attack that make a V: G4, H3, and J4
The opposite V is bad: G3, H4, and J3
Except in special circumstances of course. It seems W may be thinking of making a big moyo, but this seems the wrong way to go about it.  This will settle black and give him a strong shape to attack from.]
WL[468];B[fo]C[I might have played H3 directly to settle myself here.  If W now plays D6, he is building territotry.  Black is getting a bigger moyo, so it's probably ok too.  It's probably a stronger way of playing, but maybe a little harder.]
BL[451];W[hn]C[This is terrible for white.  I can't see any point to this move except to help black.]
WL[466];B[jn]C[Wrong direction.  This shows small thinking on blacks part and it makes white's move almost ok, but only almost.  If b wanted to jump, F7 was better. Again I would have played H3 just to settle my stones.]
BL[447];W[dn]C[White finally makes the right move.  This shows how bad blacks last move was.  Think about changing the order of the moves.  If white D6 after black F5, then would black really L6 next?  Of course not.]
WL[459];B[fm]C[I don't know, it seems to just help white build territory.  Maybe black is too bent on capturing the white stones.  But if you invest so much in it, and then fail, the game is over.  Better to let them run later and chase them lightly just to gain some power.  White should D8 here. Of course if white plays somethign aweful like H8, then blacks move was OK.]
BL[439];W[hl]C[See previous two comments.  H3 is becoming a very important point now.]
WL[455];B[jl]C[Both black and White are missing the whole point here.  I'm not quite sure what the goal is.  black is making a moyo on the right, but I suspect he might not be thining about that.  And he needs another move at Q5 to secure it.]
BL[427];W[dl]WL[450];B[dr]C[too small]BL[416];W[cq]C[too small]WL[445];B
[hq]C[Good.]BL[394];W[gp]WL[438];B[fp]C[Maybe too greedy for black.  Trying to hold on to all your stones too tightly is a good way to lose.  G3 looked bigger, stronger and better. Of course if black wasn't jumping ot the middle for no good reason, there wouldn't be stones there to worry about losing.  Also, the right side is the important side for black now, not hanging on to two stones.  If black played G3, then W F4, then B Q5, well, it would be MUCH bigger for black then this way.  Now he can be cut up and will have to worry about eye space.]
BL[381];W[gq]WL[432];B[gr]BL[377];W[hr]WL[429];B[fs]BL[360];W[iq]C[Good for white, terrible terrible terrible for black.  This just shows the complete pointlessness of blacks line of thinking.  Too greedy, thinking too small.  Black lost sight of the big picture. You have to look at the whole board.  Now blacks stones on the left have to worry about eyes, and the moyo on the right is open.  Black has gained nothing at all, and white has made solid territory on the left.  The game is almost over at this point.]
WL[425];B[cr]C[painful to have to make moves like this.]BL[327];W[qo]C[White is worry too much about blacks moyo, when his own is bigger.  The low invasion is also bad with the chinese fuseki, Q5 would have been better.  Black can play R4 here and make white heavy.  But since white could jump in on the bottom anyway, there was no rush to invade. Defending the upper left corner might have been better and bigger.]
WL[422];B[qm]C[Bad, wrong direction.  You already have a pincer stone, this stone makes the one at Q9 redundant. R4 was much better.  You must have a plan, not just try and play soem joseki move you remember.]
BL[302];W[qq]WL[416];B[qr]BL[281];W[pp]WL[399];B[oq]BL[270];W[rq]WL[384]
;B[rr]BL[256];W[op]WL[374];B[nq]BL[244];W[lr]C[This is too much.  White wants everything?  White has a serious advantage.  There is no reason to play risky to risk losing it.  White should just settle the invading stones safely and then defend the upper left corner.  This move is just plain greedy and risky, and not very big.]
WL[342];B[kr]C[Black has missed the point, he is trying to outsmart himself here.  He has to immediately attack the invading stones very hard, S6 immediately.  He doesn't have to worry much about his bottom stones yet, he needed to seize the opportunity white gave him.]
BL[193];W[kq]WL[335];B[jr]BL[173];W[jq]WL[333];B[lq]BL[147];W[mq]WL[329]
;B[lp]BL[130];W[nr]WL[327];B[or]C[This is a disaster for black.  His only way to save face was to play N4 then O4, forcing white to play S6 to live.  If white now plays N4, black might as well resign.]
BL[118];W[mp]WL[319];B[np]BL[112];W[mo]WL[315];B[no]C[If white wants to live with the invading stones, he has to play something like S6, which might not work anymore.  However those stones are now small, and white should ignore them and play in the upper left.  If black then plays an extra move at S6 to kill white, then white gets another move in the upper left to secure it, and this would make his moyo impregnable to black.  But judging >from the way these players have played, I would guess that white will now try and save the stones on right.]
BL[106];W[mn]C[If you are going to play here, this is the better direction, but it's too small.]
WL[311];B[nn]BL[91];W[mm]WL[291];B[nm]BL[81];W[rn]C[way way way too small, and not even really alive anymore.]
WL[283];B[rm]C[S4 was the only hope of killing, but maybe it wouldn't have worked anyway, so this is probably better.  But white shouldn't bother, sente in the upper left is bigger.  Black still ahve to play a move to kill white here, that would give white two free moves elsewhere, easily bigger than this.]
BL[78];W[pn]C[Wrong, s4 only, no b can play s4]WL[462];B[rp]BL[458];W[sp]

BL[320];W[mk]WL[371];B[ll]BL[318];W[om]WL[368];B[po]BL[299];W[qp]C[w should have played R6 here if he wanted to try and run]
WL[365];B[qn]BL[290];W[sm]WL[356];B[rl]C[This is strange for both of them.  I'm not sure what white is planning.  It doesn't make sense to me.  White seems to have thrown away stones.]

BL[116];W[qe]C[White's greedy is almost beyond compare.  Black should immediately play Q9 then P11 and white is in serious trouble and then black has recovered >from his earlier mistakes.  Worry about these white stones at the top right is pointless.]
