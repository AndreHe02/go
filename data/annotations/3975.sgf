AB[dp][pd]C[Thanks in advance to the reviewer for taking out your time to comment my game. I especially would appreciate comments regarding my opening and middle game strategy. Of course I am also very thankful for comments regarding others aspects of my game.

-----------------------------------
Hello, I my name is Neil Mclean and I will be reviewing your game. I will make comments with [NM\].
Your opening didnt seem too bad, although it was a 2 handicap game.
Yes, your middle game let you down and the fact that your followed your opponents moves too much and didnt see the whole board for bigger moves elsewhere.

I've put in some variations with some ideas, hope you find it helpfull.]
;W[qp];B[dd];W[fp];B[dm]C[[NM\] D7 is possible, D6 would be the standard response here]
;W[jp]
(;B[jc]C[[NM\] This is a defensive move and is big (Oba), it is OK. Another idea would be to try the kakari at P4 or O7 possible]
;W[cf]C[[NM\] This is a good move by white, it is the correct direction of play, since black threatens to turn the right side into territory]

(;B[gd]C[[NM\] Again, F16 would be better here since if white H17, black can attack strongly]
;W[cj];B[ch]C[Was this invasion at C12 not properly backed up?

[NM\] C12 is perfect, black is strong both sides so any fighting will favour black.
C10 might be better at C11];W[ef];B[di]C[Was wD11 the proper response to bE14?

[NM\] yes, attack from the weak side, good move];W[dj]
(;B[ej]C[I decide here to give up the one (or two) stone(s) and win influence toward the center and connect with my two lower stones. Is this the right direction of play here? What did I do amiss attempting this?

[NM\] walk ahead of your opponent, so the hane leaves a serious cutting point at E11
As long as you walk out to the centre and keep the two white groups apart this is the right strategy. Black can not get a bad result.]

(;W[ci];B[ek];W[dh]
(;B[eh];W[dg];B[ei];W[gf]C[[NM\] both white and black made mistakes here.
black should play E11 first, as the E12 for G14 exchange only helps white.
This is called Tewari (analysis), so you see that after E11 and white D13, black would never dream of playing E12 next since white would play G14.]

(;B[md];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[rd]

(;B[qk];W[qi];B[qn];W[oo]C[I thought that I lost abit in this R6 - P5 Exchange as it seems to have helped develop white's moyo.

[NM\] yes, now white gets a good move and black is left with a weak group to take care of.]
;B[gh]C[[NM\] A move like P9 is important now to defend  the weak group]
;W[ig];B[he]C[Instead of H15, Afterwards I thought I should have played at J11. But then again do I really need to play along this white group as it extends?

[NM\] J13 does not look a good move to me, the knights move can be cut, and J13 does not gain  territory.

H15 not needed as black is strong already, if you wanted to cut, H13 would be good.

Black has sente so should defend either at P9 or perhaps attack at H4 or H3]
;W[ii];B[hf];W[gg];B[hg];W[hh];B[hi];W[ih];B[gi];W[ik];B[nk]
C[[NM\] mybe a little too loose to defend, but right idea at this moment]
;W[ni]
(;B[lh]C[[NM\] I cant see what the point of this move is.
It neither attacks strong enough since white is strong here and gains 0 points

Now would be good for H4, H3 or perhaps O3 if you feel ambitious]
;W[li];B[kh];W[ki];B[mh];W[nh];B[nf];W[pe];B[od];W[qe]
(;B[mj]C[[NM\] I dont like this peep since it only helps white to connect , bad]
;W[mi];B[jj];W[ij];B[ji];W[jh];B[kk]C[Instead of meddling in the center. I think I should be concentrating more on solidifying my territory on top or invading at N4 or N5?

[NM\] yes, you are right, there is nothing to be gained in the centre in this game.
The big points (Oba) are B16, O3, H3, H4, D3
D3 because white can still invade C3, which is worth 30 points and very big at this middle game stage.]
;W[mg]C[[NM\] There is no good move for black to save this group]
;B[lg]C[[NM\] bad shape];W[lf];B[lk];W[jk];B[kj];W[om];B[pl]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[ol];B[ok];W[ml];B[mk];W[pj];B[pk];W[ll];B[kl]
C[[NM\] good, it would be horrible to be shut in];W[ln];B[km]
;W[im];B[er];W[eq];B[dq];W[fr];B[dr];W[bm]
(;B[bo]C[[NM\] This was the move tha got you into trouble and let white split black. C6 is the correct move in this shape]
;W[cn]
(;B[cm]C[[NM\] This seems a wasted move, it is a thank-you move and helps white to connect.]
;W[bn];B[co];W[dn];B[en];W[eo];B[do];W[em];B[dl];W[fn];B[gk]
;W[fl]
(;B[eg];W[ff];B[kn];W[mn];B[ck];W[bk];B[bl];W[dk];B[cl];W[el]
C[[NM\] So overall, you had some good ideas, such as trying to get influence in a handicap game and trying to spot big points to play, as well as spotting urgent moves over big moves such as black playing O9 to defend.

There were some tactical errors such as peeping at N11, and B5 instead of C6. Also not walking ahead when you invaded at C12.

It seems you followed white a little too much, which meant white getting all the big points in the game.

If its possible to cut and keep you opponent into weak groups , generally it is good as long as you have a plan that will make points and not cut for no reason.

I can recommend you read the 'Shape UP! by Charles Matthews' ebook that can be found on gobase.org . It may be a little advanced for you but will show you some simple tactics, shapes and ideas about how to handle situations better. And its free!

Good luck with your go.
