Alot of times, more so with white, we feel behind on the board.  It's important to keep a level mind and not panic, or else our style will reflect

To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game. I don't know where I'm going wrong, but it seems that every time I play, I fall badly behind early on.

More frustrating, it seems that I try the same things my opponents do, but while they work well for my opponents, they don't work for me.  My opponent approached and quickly ended up with a strong group; my approach promptly left me with a weak group.  My opponent invaded and immediately gave me a weak group; I invade and get killed right away.  And I can't spot any differences between what my opponents are doing and what I'm doing.

It would be hard to say. 

Fuseki is about buildling, and getting key points.  Often if you invade or exploint weakness to early, your oppent gets compensation elsewhere.

I would leave it and play q5 myself.  My thought is that the weakness is going to remain on the board unless he wants to spend a move to fix it, So i'm willing to let it sit for a while.

Ted: I wondered whether I should have invaded immediately at H3.  Whenever I play stones like F3/K4, my opponent splits them and leaves me with a terrible weakness.  It's reached the point that I don't play that far apart any more simply so I don't end up getting split.]

(;W[pi];B[ql]TR[qf][pi]C[I addressed this in the varation

Ted: I'm worried that the stones at R14 and Q11 will become a weakness.]
;W[jc]TR[lc]C[+++ 

Right idea, but m17 is the place to do this.  Now here, Black can play m17 and fix the problem, while making territory, and putting presure on your stone.

+++

Ted: I wasn't certain what to do, so I decided to try to make Black's group in the top right weak.  I've noticed that when I play a pair of stones on the fourth line like Black's, my opponent responds with an approach like the one at K17, and leaves me with a weak group.]
;B[cf]C[+++

q11 and r14 are hardly weak =)  things are pretty okay so far
  
I would reply with c16 see varation
+++


Ted: This move really bothered me.  I approached at R14 and ended up with a weak group; my opponent approaches here and gets away with it with no problem.]

Ted: Should I have extended to either D18 or D16 instead of playing a hane?]
;B[cd];W[ec];B[bb];W[db];B[ee];W[gd]C[Ted: I couldn't afford to let Black invade someplace like G17.]
;B[qe];W[pf]C[+++ 

correct play, this move does a better job of ensuring the groups life. 
First instinct should always be to play out, and to the center.  Being imprisioned is far worse then death.

+++  


Ted: I played this instinctively because it looks like the best shape.  Should I have played at S15 instead to try to ensure I get eyes on the side?]
;B[po];W[dk]C[
Ted: I decided (quite rightly, as the game shows) that if I allowed Black to play in between the C6 and C12 stones, it would be a disaster for me.]
;B[fo]C[+++

It's hard to read out, but even h3 maybe possible (see varation)
it is important in go not to see any formation as rock solid, almost all formations have holes in them, it's really a question of do you gain more, or loose my from explointing them.

Ted: Now I can't invade at H4 any more.]

;B[nc];W[nb];B[ob];W[mb];B[cj]C[+++  

Just need to play more, review more, look at more games, etc. to get a feel for invasion.  it will come in time. 

+++

I don't understand why Black's invasion works, but when I try my own invasion later, it goes badly wrong.]
;W[dj];B[ci];W[di];B[bh];W[dh];B[bg];W[ck];B[cq];W[cp]C[Ted: I thought about D3, but I thought that would leave me with nothing but thickness that I can't use for anything.  This way I get a living group.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[fp];W[mp]C[+++

You are not so far behind as to reach desperation.  I think that maybe you are counting incorrectly, or giving you oppent to much credit.  Here you have to come out  play calm =)  DrStaw has some good stuff in his profile about counting on KGS

See varation

+++ 

Ted: I played this out of desperation.  I knew I was trailing badly and had to do something drastic.  Obviously, I can't afford to let Black take the entire bottom of the board.]

This is a panic response.

Ted: I don't see any way my group at the bottom can get any eyes.  I had a sinking feeling the game was already hopelessly lost, but I played on largely because I'm so bad figuring out just how far behind or ahead I am in any position.]

Group IS NOT DEAD YET!!! =)

T19 is ko.  

the game isn't over either, if you win the ko, blacks group doesn't have any eyes!

Ted: I realized there was no way I could get two eyes in the corner, so I resigned.



  The way I see it, I've got maybe 25 points at the top, 15 on the left, 2 on the bottom right 10 in the top right if I'm lucky, and 6.5 points of komi, for about 60 points maximum.  Black already has 60 points on the bottom, 15 points on the top left, and 20 points in the top right, for 95 points.  More significantly, I still have two weak groups in addition to all the dead groups I've already got; Black doesn't have any weaknesses.]
