AB[dp][pd]C[Hi, I will be reviewing this game for black as requested. I will comment on moves for both sides as we go and summarize by thoughts at the end. Enjoy!

EvilBaron [5k?\]: hoi hoi
yotsuzaru [3k\]: hi];W[pp];B[dc];W[fq]C[The approach on the unbalanced corner would be a bit more natural.]
;B[ce]C[You are correct, the enclosure facing the 4x4 stone is a very nice position.

I decided to ignore the approach because I felt the shimari would be easier to deal with later.]
;W[jp]C[White is playing conservatively.];B[dn]C[This move is fine. Whether you go with knight's move or one-point is a matter of preference, although I would prefer this move because of the low stone at C15. In a handicap game playing actively on the fourth line is a bit better in most cases.

I find the low enclosure could have been more safe in retrospect? Or were there bigger moves that required attention?]
;W[jc]C[White has to take this point to prevent a double wing.]
;B[nc];W[gc];B[qn];W[cl]C[The classic move is at E7, although the pincer is also fine, actually preferred, considering you have support on that side.

I would welcome some variations on how to deal with this.];B[cj]
C[The classic pincer is a 2 point one at C11, although considering C15 this move is good.]
;W[el]
(;B[ej]C[The correct continuation is from the other side at F6. You need to protect that group and separate white's two sides. Consider the variation shown.]
;W[bn];B[cq]C[Now you are forced to defend and white can connect over the top. The first major mistake of the game.]
;W[dr]C[Ok white decides to slide in, not sure if I agree with this play.]
;B[gp]C[The idea to separate the two groups is good, although at this point you might have to worry about your own stones first. I would prefer to defend at C2, although I can't say your move is bad.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[gq];B[fn];W[hp];B[nq]
(;W[lq]C[I agree with you, I also don't like this move from white. There's not much wrong with the standard move at P5. Because white has the option of taking the stone at G5, his bottom group is quite strong.

This move felt a bit overprotective as it makes his lower side a bit overconcentrated. What would the best reply for white be here?]
;B[qq]C[Now it's hard to see how white can use the wall in either direction.]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[qp];W[pn];B[mo]C[This move is heavy. If you want to reduce the bottom now I would prefer the lighter move at N6, although I also like Q7 (I'm quite a territorial player, an active player would attack the E8 group first and honestly it's probably better, although a handicap game if you're worried about the fight, playing conservatively is also fine), hitting on the border between the two outlines. White's bottom looks big, but it's actually not so scary due to the concentration. G5 and O3 both have potential left and it's hard to see how white can defend the moyo and the E8 group at the same time.]
;W[nr];B[pm];W[qo];B[ro];W[po];B[qm];W[om]C[Now it's clear that N5 was an overplay.]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[kn];W[jo];B[mp]C[Heavy, I would prefer to jump out at N7. It's not necessary to save all the stones.]
;W[im];B[gl]C[Yes, I had not seen this comment in the previous moves but it seems this question is already answered. Because of the exchange starting from N5 (black has gained a weak group, white's stones have become stronger), it has become much harder to attack the white group at E8.

I had lost track of my groups. I have two weak groups at this point. Should I have played more lightly with respect to the group at N5?]
;W[gm]
(;B[fl]C[Black loses a lot with the upcoming exchange, F7 seems fine here. You'll have to keep an eye on jumping out with the N5 group, but likewise white has to be careful on the left. Your mentality here seems to be a bit defensive, in reality your corner group is quite safe with the C2 option.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[bm];W[cn];B[co];W[en];B[bo]
;W[do];B[an];W[dn];B[cr];W[bl];B[am];W[dq]C[This sequence is very, very painful for black. Big loss in points and the handicap advantage is now gone.]
;B[ds];W[er];B[aq];W[cp];B[bp];W[ao];B[br]C[Again I had not seen this question, but seems like it's already been answered. I'm curious as to why you avoided the standard pinwheel shape in response to the cut. In reality white's group was in more danger, but you seemed a bit afraid and allowed white to connect his groups without a fight.

This was very painful for me. What should/could I have done to prevent it?]
;W[al];B[qi]C[This should be on the fourth line at Q11 if you want to play in the general area. You are behind on points and need to use the power of the Q7 stones. It's actually difficult to see the best move here overall, P8 is very important but you also need to save your group at around L8. Seems the two points are miai for white, although I don't see any other choice than L8 for black here.]
;W[ol]C[White takes the big point.];B[kl]C[You lost a move because of R11.]
;W[qk];B[qf]C[Passive. This is the territorial move but now you have to play at P11, creating the moyo and also helping L8.]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[oj]C[Now the two groups are cut off.];B[kj];W[fk]
;B[hk];W[fj];B[ei];W[fi];B[ek];W[ik];B[hj];W[jk];B[kk];W[fh]
;B[dg]C[First specific comment, I know you're worried about the cut but in this position because of the points situation and C10, you need to go a little more aggressive and play E13.

As to answer the question about avoiding weak groups, there's no easy answer. With that said, I think you focus on heavily on local fights to the detriment of your overall board position. You are looking a lot at your own weak groups, but for instance white had a big weakness in the D7 group earlier that you seemed to miss. In general, you strengthen your own stones when you attack (your stones should never become weaker in attack, if they do it means you're overextending and chasing the kill). You also need to look at the balance between third and fourth line stones. The classic saying is that third line is for territory and fourth is for power. Remember that power helps weak groups, it gives them a point of safety (as a thought excercise, notice how much better your position here would be if C15 were on D15 instead. There were also a few cases where you could have used a one-point jump earlier to help out your groups, such as at P11. There are "big" moves and then there are "urgent" moves, you need to play the latter first.

Again I have weak groups. How to avoid this?];W[hl];B[gk]C[Of course, it is the only way back into the game.

My reasoning here was to try to attack the floating group of white at F11]
;W[ji];B[hh];W[eh];B[dh];W[ff]C[I would peep at J11 first as white.]
;B[gd]C[At first glance, the natural shapes to separate are at F16 and G15, although I played out a few variations on both and it seems like white is around 2 moves ahead in the capturing race. To be honest it's not reasonable to go directly for the kill on the white group. If both black and white survive and black turns all his potential territory on the top left and right into real points, the game might still be close, although this would be hard and at this point white would have to help with a few mistakes.

What is the best way to separate white here?];W[fd];B[hd];W[ec]
;B[hc];W[db]C[Playing lightly with the K17 stone is correct from white.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[bb];W[gb];B[hb];W[hf]C[This new weak group is a consequence of the unreasonable plan to go for the kill, G16 was always an overplay.

Again, many weak groups...];B[fb];W[fc];B[ii]C[Too late, white got H14 for free from the top exchange, again you have lost a move.]
;W[jj];B[jh];W[ki];B[mj]C[I don't think it's possible to save both groups at once.]

;W[id];B[he];W[ge];B[hg];W[gf];B[jd];W[ic];B[kc];W[ib];B[jb]
;W[ha]C[Painful for black...now the points difference is huge and I'm not sure how black can win them back.]
;B[jg];W[mh];B[nf]C[Small, any of the major endgame points are bigger (B10, L18, S10, S8).]
;W[kb]C[A big move.];B[lc];W[mf];B[me];W[ng];B[og]C[This was an unfortunate mistake..]

[kr][ks][la][ld][lr][ls][mb][me][ms][nf][ns][on][rk]C[Looking at this game, it seems the natural next area for improvement is your fighting. You correctly point out your tendency to create new weak groups, this is a consequence of overplays. Remember that the point of attacks isn't just to kill stones, it's to push your opponent in the direction of your choosing and essentially get "free" moves to build a stronger position. The whole idea of the one-point pincer on the left in the beginning was to separate white and force white to play with 2 weaker groups, but you then immediately retreated into the corner and allowed white to connect easily. I might consider playing a more power-oriented opening style on the fourth line and try to force fights as practice to get more comfortable with choosing direction of play and protecting and attacking weak groups.
