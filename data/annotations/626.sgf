;B[id];W[qc]C[R17 seems more imortant to b than J16];B[qd];W[rc]
;B[qn]C[Q14 group weak and R6 starts new group in the area, probably better to make an extention at R10]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[gd];B[hc]C[I like H17, prevents base for white and give b better shape]
;W[fb];B[eb]C[Because there is no eye for white on this side, I think an extension to D14 or C14 would be better than E18]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[cc];B[cd];W[bb];B[be];W[ac];B[cf]C[Good, outside seems more important, corner is small for white]
;W[db];B[ck]C[E19 is important, it keeps white F18 group week if b playes there, but c9 is good because it creates base for b and removes base from white so I think this is good for b]
;W[ea];B[dh]C[D12 seems small and passive, perhaps e9 would accomplish the same thing on a larger scale, although it is more complicated]
;W[ed];B[dc];W[jc];B[jd];W[kc];B[kd];W[lb];B[mc]C[M16 here is sufficient, w will likely play N18, b makes a bad shape here with N16]
;W[mb];B[md];W[nd];B[qi]C[R11 is good and necessary, I thought w would get to play here first.]
;W[ql];B[co]C[should not ignore R8, c6 alread damaged, w does not have to respond]
;W[en];B[nq]C[b got lucky, white responded to C5.   O3 seems good to me.]
;W[np];B[mp];W[oq];B[no];W[op];B[mq]C[B could consider connecting at N5 here instead of N3]
;W[pm];B[pn];W[on];B[oo];W[po];B[nn];W[om]C[No point in this sequence for b, can just play J4 directly]
;B[ip];W[eq];B[dq];W[ep];B[eo]C[there seems to be some tactical errors in this sequence]
;W[fo]C[I think b connection at D5 is better, w cannot capture f3 stone]
;B[fq];W[do];B[er];W[cp];B[cq];W[bo];B[eo]C[Taking these stones does not help b group, so should play elswhere, probably some move to help K16 group]
;W[lo];B[mo];W[kq]C[this is definately overplay for w, b b falls into the trap. b doesn't have too much of a liberties problem so L4 will keep w stone disconnected]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[ko];W[jo];B[ln];W[jp];B[iq]C[K6 necessary for b]
;W[kn];B[km];W[lo];B[mm];W[jm];B[nm]C[L8 also important so w cannot push, o7 only 1 gote eye.]
;W[kl];B[lm];W[ro]C[S5 seems poorly timed];B[qm];W[pk];B[el]
C[E8 doesn't seem to do much, not sure of it's purpose];W[ik]
;B[nk];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi]C[O10 is not good, it forces w to play a move that b must responde to but is small]
;B[ph];W[ni];B[ll];W[kk]C[M8 makes w get good shape];B[ol];W[pl]
;B[ok];W[mk]C[b still has an eye at the bottom so should O10 to keep on outside]
;B[ml];W[mj];B[nl];W[qj];B[lr];W[kr];B[or];W[pr];B[os];W[me]
;B[ld]C[hard to keep three stone when w is strong and b has no eyes]
;W[gf];B[he];W[ge];B[hf];W[gh];B[lf];W[jf];B[ih];W[kg];B[ng]
;W[mf];B[lg];W[mg];B[kh];W[hh];B[jh];W[hg];B[ig];W[le]C[L15 and the group will live!]

 colic 16k*: I'm done, thanks for the game


Summary: I don't think your fuseki was as bad as you thought.  The real loses came in the fighting.  You need to ask the question "What is most important?" a little more often.]
