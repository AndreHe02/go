cjmichael: Hi.  Thanks in advance for reviewing my game.  This is my first game submitted for review.  I'm new to the world of Go and would like advice on how to better my game.  In this game, like so many others I play, I felt as I was playing that I had the upper hand.  Though, alas, I seem to always lose by a couple of points.

Hi my name is Rory, hope this helps.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[cd]

cjmichael: Regarding joseki, I've really only learned about them last week.  I figured I was doing things correctly, but was still hesitant to make the moves and responses I did.]

(;B[pi]C[R: Not joseki , see variation];W[nq]
(;B[qn]C[R: A bit passive , see sequence];W[pr];B[kp]TR[qq]
C[R: Rather defend the corner at R3 (triangle) and then when white jumps along the side to settle you take sente.]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[dr];B[dk]C[R: Again defend the corner, it settles your group in the process.]

cjmichael: At this point, It seems to me that I have the upper hand, due to the few small plays that my opponent made.  Am I right about this?  This is mostly the reason why I tried not to make any big moves the rest of the game.

R: Yes you are ahead so now you need to win the won game as they say.

1 and 2 are big moves at this time, see sequences that could happen.]
;W[no];B[kn];W[nm];B[kl];W[iq]C[R: White has made very little in this sequence , attacking the top right would still keep you ahead.]
;B[gm];W[pf];B[qg];W[kc]LB[qc:3][ke:1][ql:2]C[R: Big moves:

1. Build large moyo on the left.
2. Defend your side (see variation for when white plays there)
3. Invade corner.]

cjmichael: Is this a good response, or a bad one?

R: No, White can still play c8 , better to play ay triangle]

cjmichael:  Another bad move?

R: Yes , you dont gain any points with the move plus you lose the stone thus giving the opponent extra points.

Now is the time to play your sente ,see the numbered examples.]
