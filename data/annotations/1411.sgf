C[ThornBird(17k*)-lueo(17k)

I lose at the final stage. A big bad move at W294.
But I am wondering what's wrong at the left-down side. I should not lose that much! Please tell
me why...

JR:

The corner is not important at this stage. you have played a lot of stones to get the wall - you want to gain more than a couple of points in the corner.

Your wall is fairly strong. Black has played close to it so you should attack from the other side and push black into the wall.  If you allow the G17 stone to make a base you have no attack and not even potential territory.]

(;W[lc];B[ab];W[ca];B[be]
(;W[dg]C[JR: White  is crawling one move behind Black so black has the advantage.

Now is a good time to attack the two Black stones];B[dh];W[fg]
;B[gg];W[eh];B[di]
(;W[cn]LB[po:a][le:b][gh:c]C[JR:

C6 is not necessarily bad but it is not a good time.

It does not secure the corner and white does not have to respond to it.

Here are some alternative ideas.

A is a more important move in the lower part of the board.

B, and C l work around the idea of having a weak Black group between two stronger White ones.]
;B[cl];W[gq]C[JR:

Again this move is not so important as the alternatives mentioned previously]
;B[ei]
(;W[fi]C[JR:

I would prefer the alternative since it threatens, for example to break through with  G14.  It  may get a response instead of the peep.

F11 is a bit easy for Black. With the peep Black extends his string of stones, gaining liberties and  because white  connects black does this in sente.]
;B[gh];W[fh];B[nc]C[JR:   Notice how the situation has changed.

Now White's 2 stones are under the shadow of black's line of stones.

Black O17 threatens the stones  while developing the corner at the same time.   Admittedly Black's corner is no stronger than White's similar move the bottom right( C6)  BUT notice how White developed passively allowing Black moves elsewhere. Black develops with White forced to respond.]
;W[mb];B[jc]C[They've died... why?

JR:

They are not dead yet. But there are 3 white stones against 7 surrounding black stones so white is fighting at a disadvantage.]

(;W[jb]MA[ld][kd][id][md]CR[kc][nb][ob][hb]C[JR:

I would hane on the outside.  Imagine black stones as shown by the X and white by the o.

 While White struggles to live Black may form a wall on the outside which combines very well with the G12-G17 wall and casts its influence over more than half the board.

It will not happen exactly as shown but anything like this gives Black power. White living on the edge is no comparison.]
;B[jd];W[qo]C[JR:

If White wishes to save  the stones at the top he cannot afford to play elsewhere now.]
;B[kb];W[kc];B[ib];W[qq];B[pp];W[qp];B[kq];W[mq]C[JR:

Good, Black extended too far from the 2 stones];B[lp]
(;W[mp]C[JR: Black needs to trap and kill these white stones.

The diagonal move lookslike it gets out more easily and does more to attack the two Q3/4 stones]
;B[mo];W[np];B[no]
(;W[lr];B[po]
(;W[pr]C[I should move left, right?

JR: You mean crawling at L2?

This may help your stones escape but black will build a strong outside position.

It may be better to play your 2 moves in the game, which gain territory. Then allow the N3 stones to be captured and move up the side in compensation. See later comments]

Locally better to simply let them go.

The capture leaves a nice strong position andyou get 2 moves in a row because  black still has to make another move to stop you saving these stones]

C[JR:   This is good by black. White is under pressure on the top

The odd  point with the ko's  at the bottom is not important in comparison.]

(;W[pn]LB[le:a]C[JR:

If white wishes to save the top - not necessarily the thing to do at the moment - there may be a chance with A. I don't think its worth it however.

Rather than hane I would prefer to extend further up the side. It seems important to get into blacks potential centre]

JR:

They're dead.  I can't really see any good moves.   The 3 Q13 stones are dead. The Q9 stones are dead, or at least in great danger and Black seems ahead by many points.

I think White has lost unless he can save Q9 AND expand his corner AND reduce blacks top territory.

Options might be

1) Turning at G11, hoping to reduce the huge top territory and also improve the escape chances for Q9 stones

2) J6, expanding the corner and reaching out towards the Q9 stones.

B's response to both these will probably leave white more strongly  trapped at Q9

3) P6 to try and live / escape
