;B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[kc];W[qj];B[dj];W[cl]C[a moyo game is develo\
ping, and a third-line stone invites a cap. If W plays 2 such stones, h\
e must be confident he can erase the moyo while taking solid territory;\
 but in this case, the 2 star-points are contradictory.];B[jj]
;W[qf]C[strange. helps B secure his position, while W gets a low one. B\
 will be able to press W from above , which is thw way to build center \
territory.];B[od];W[el]C[big. B should have capped there.];B[fj]
;W[fc];B[hc];W[db];B[fd]C[seems W is getting life too easy, with consid\
erable territory, while W still has H10
to invade the center.];W[gc];B[gd];W[hb];B[ic];W[cc];B[cd]C[this is sma\
ll since W can slide from the other side. if you're playing big moyo ga\
me, play boldly - G8 or Q13, for example. you must press W from above
to build toyr center. already you can't compete with W in solid territo\
ry.];W[jq];B[gl]C[D3 and K5 are also possible.];W[jo];B[gn]
C[looks good , but deceiveing. W takes 4-line territory. better to inva\
de the corner - W's area around G6 will not be big anyway.]
;W[gp];B[pg]C[good, B took both G8 and Q13. W's star points are still o\
pen to 3-3 invasion of course.];W[qg];B[ph];W[qh];B[oj];W[qn]
;B[ol]C[good.];W[mp];B[oc]C[good shift in minf set - from expanding to \
caution. it is important to keep flexibility of mind during the game, f\
or exapmle ceasing an attack to get secure profit instead goping all-ou\
t to kill.];W[ib];B[jb];W[bj];B[bk];W[ck]C[should be at c10.]
;B[bi];W[cj];B[ci];W[bl]C[extremely small right now.];B[di]
C[unnecessary - if W cuts, B atari at E11, then jump to c13. W can't fi\
ght like this.];W[en];B[cq]C[can't live, W too strong here now. better \
try leaving some aji with H4, F4 etc.];W[bp];B[cp];W[bo];B[dq]

at was supposed to fail too. it is very important to estimate if you ca\
n live inside your opponent's sphere of influence.])
