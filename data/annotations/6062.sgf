C[In this Game I kept making walls instead of taking territory which I dont do very much cause i dont know how to use walls effectively so if you could show me some tips on that that would be awesome.

I appreciate any assisstance you may be able to provide.];B[qd]

(;B[np]C[I'm told that the pincer at R9 works really well here for a whole board thing but i dont like using that move and decided on this one. I'm sure its okay here but would the shusaku diagonal have been better? or perhaps i should have pincered I always have trouble figuring out how to play in corners like this.


Yes a pincer in this case could be great in order to make your stone work with each other]

yes you'r right this is a weakness but you can't exploit it now]

C[I was sure this move would be played next and had already decided to cap it but it seems to end up alive was there a better way to attack it? 

you must use your stone on the right, because the stone on the left are weak

but the game is end you won't make much point in the center]
