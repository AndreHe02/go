AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Chris: Hi, I am playing a UK 3d. Although I am not sure why I lost this game. I thought I am doing rather well attacking his groups, but in the end not only did they survive, but I am a good amount of points short!

Thank you very much for looking at this game.

[EV\] This is your reviewer Eric Vella.  My comments will be marked [EV\].

In general, I think you attacked too much, and worried too little about your own safety.  Not a good idea when your opponent is much stronger.  Think more about attacking to make territory, while keeping your own groups strong, instead of attacking to kill.]
;W[qp];B[oq];W[lp];B[on]C[[EV\] This wide jump is certainly good, but you need to know how to handle a cut by W, which is a standard continuation, and the likely choice by W in a handicap game.]
;W[oo];B[no];W[po];B[np];W[nn];B[om]LB[mn:A]C[Chris: After the game I know this should have been at A, but I wanted to create some influence along the top in order to use my top right corner stone.

[EV\] The joseki at A intends to pressure the M4 stone by sacrificing the P6 stone.  This is a fair trade which keeps the B corner strong.  Your move lets the corner get surrounded and leads at best to a difficult fight, with W having the stronger position.]
;W[mn];B[qr];W[qm];B[ok];W[pl];B[ol];W[pj]C[Chris: Seems like my centre group is too heavy.]
;B[ll];W[kn];B[qh];W[qi]C[[EV\] I think this move helps B more than W.  It does not remove the aji of a B move at R9.  Just defending at R10 seems better.]
;B[ph];W[oj];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj];W[pk]C[[EV\] Letting the outside stone get cut cannot be good for W.]
;B[rq]C[[EV\] Does your group need this to live?  If so, W could have killed you a few moves ago.  Does this move threaten the life of the W group?  If not, it is an endgame move, much less important than the fight in the center.  This is your opportunity to gain an advantage in the center.]
;W[ml];B[mm]C[[EV\] This seems overly complicated and leads to a bad result, as you notice later.  You could defend against the cut instead with M9 or M10, moves which help more on the outside.]
;W[lm];B[nl]C[Chris: Seems like awful shape. Is there a better way to handle the situation?]
;W[rp]C[[EV\] Same comment for W S4 as for B S3.  Since this move does not affect the life of either group, it is small compared to the cut at P11.]
;B[oi]C[Chris: Cutting seems necessary.

[EV\] Good!  But be reasonable about what you expect here.  When W pulls out this stone, you should be able to keep your groups safe and make territory while attacking.]
;W[nh];B[lh]C[[EV\] Nice move.  Did you read out that W cannot cut with N11 or M11?]
;W[nf];B[nd]C[[EV\] This move is good, but a defensive move at Q14 would be simpler and also good.]
;W[lg];B[kg]C[Chris: Is the hane ok here? Maybe just stretching is better?

[EV\] The hane is good.  If w cuts, you can easily handle the fight.]
;W[lf];B[kh];W[mq];B[nq]C[Chris: Best way to live?

[EV\] O2 might be slightly better, but this is OK.];W[pf];B[og]
C[[EV\] This is complicated.  Why not just connect underneath at R14?  The territorial gain would be large.]
;W[of];B[ng];W[ld];B[mg];W[mf];B[id]C[Chris: This seems like a good result for Black.

[EV\] The result up to this move is good, but now your corner is completely surrounded.  I would invest a move like S16 to defend the corner, and let W extend on the side.]
;W[nm]C[[EV\] After B captures the O11 cutting stones, this move does not threaten the B center and hence is too small.  If W wants to strengthen his bottom group, an extension around F3 would be better.]
;B[oc]C[Chris: I was very anxious about this slow move. I wanted to deal with possible attachments on both sides as good as possible.]
;W[je];B[ie];W[jd];B[ic];W[qe];B[qd]C[[EV\] Here S16 should suggest itself, because it works nicely with P17.  In hindsight, it also prevents W S14 from affecting the corner.]
;W[mc];B[kb];W[rd];B[rc];W[rf];B[rg];W[rb]C[[EV\] W has been preparing this for the last few moves.]

(;B[sd]C[[EV\] This of course leads to ko, risking the entire corner.  You can also play safe and just connect or live as in the variation.]
;W[se]C[Chris: Is Ko the only possibility here?];B[re];W[jf]
;B[ig]C[[EV\] You are attacking too hard.  Just win the ko now and let W run out.  The corner is large, you can anticipate more profit from the attack, and all your groups will be safe.]
;W[rd];B[ri]C[[EV\] This does not threaten to kill the entire W side.  W could ignore it and capture the corner, worth 50 pts.]
;W[rj];B[re];W[if];B[hf];W[rd];B[qb]C[[EV\] Even if you live, having to submit like this means fighting the ko was a mistake, which means trying so hard to kill W was a mistake.  Since it does not live, it is better to continue the ko and get two moves somewhere else.]
;W[sc];B[qc];W[nb];B[ra]C[\]EV\] As a matter of technique R18 (after throwing in at T18) makes better eye shape and reduces W liberties faster.  Unfortunately B is still dead.]
;W[sb];B[qg];W[qf];B[sg];W[sf];B[ob];W[nc];B[dj]C[Chris: After loosing the corner this seems like the only move.]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cr];W[fn];B[ce]LB[el:A][gm:B]
C[Chris: Seems slow again. Is this possible here or would an attack on the bottonm white moyo be better?

[EV\] This is a good try.  You could probably extend one space further (C14) and still kill any corner invasion.  As an alternative strategy, a move at A would also be good, completing the side territory and preparing a follow-up at B to reduce the W side.]
;W[df];B[dh]C[[EV\] Good attack.  W came in deeply enough to win if he lives, so this time you probably do have to kill.]
;W[ed];B[dc]C[[EV\] E17 is natural and looks better.];W[gf]
;B[hg];W[cf];B[ch];W[ge];B[gc]C[[EV\] F17 connects and still maintains a strong attack.  Not sure if a kill is possible.]
;W[ec];B[db];W[fh];B[gi];W[eb];B[be];W[kc];B[jb];W[gb];B[hb]
;W[fc];B[gd];W[de]C[[EV\] Seems hard to kill W now, but it might still be possible.  E19 is the best way to prevent W from getting an eye at the top, since it helps the corner.  You could also just count the top as 1/2 eye and play on the other side, trying to keep W from making an eye in sente.  Several killing variations are shown.  Still, I guess W will probably find a way to live here.]

(;B[ga];W[fa];B[ha];W[bc];B[bb];W[bf];B[bd]C[Chris: White gets a forcing move at A14 later which will allow white to live. Is there a better way to make life here?

[EV\] I don't think W can be killed now.];W[fi];B[fj];W[gj]
;B[fk];W[he];B[hd];W[gg];B[hi];W[eg];B[ff];W[af];B[ac];W[bh]
;B[bi];W[ah];B[go]C[Chris: Time to do something about this then i guess.

[EV\] W is too far ahead now.  No more comments.];W[fo];B[hq]
