C[Hello, this is my game from an ASR league on KGS.
I am reading Attack and Defense book these days and as opportunity arised, i tried to build walls and get something good (that is, territory or power, not killing the opponent) from my attacks. However, most of the game I felt my wall isn't working very well and I am not very sure, where the problem was.
So I would very much like the reviewer to comment mostly on this, but I also provided some comments and questions of mine where I felt unsure about what had been played in the game and would like to hear reviewer's opinion. Also, comment on whatever else you like. :-)
Thank you!

MR: Your analysis of the game is quite ok. The theme of the game is your wall on the lower side, which is not working well. The problem is that you build walls without any supporting extensions. This happens twice in the game, with the wall on the lower side and with your moves P14, O12, building a wall without an extension on the upper edge around F17/15. 

You write that you currently read Attack and Defense. My feeling is that the standard thing happens to you that happens to everybody reading new books. One tries to utilize the new things, but they do still not work out well. The only thing to say here - keep trying. After a while they will turn out ok ;-)]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc];W[qi]C[MR: The more usual move is R10.]

(;B[fq]C[MR: Exchanging R9 against R14 prior to F3 would be an alternative.]
;W[hq]C[He spoiled my plan here. I was hoping for the c6 k4 variation.

Now, here I know just two josekis, c3 and f5. c3 seemed not so good, because it makes my q4 stone undevelopable (or so I thought, now as I look at it, I still have r8 to develop in sente and then I can get p3, so his wall would be ineffective, is that right?). So I decided to create a wall with f5 and thought I can get something out of attacking r11 later...

MR: C3 and F5 are at least two of the standard continuations locally. I personally would prefer to take the corner, as the prospects of the wall you build with F5 ff are more than unclear.

With respect to the continuation on the right side: You could have exchanged R9 (not R8 (!)) for R14 prior to F3.]

(;B[fo];W[dn];B[ip]C[MR: If you like whole board fighting, K3 might be an alternative for J4.]
;W[iq];B[jp];W[jq];B[kp];W[hp];B[ho];W[lq];B[mo];W[nq];B[np]
C[MR: The problem here is that you continue to build a wall and it is still totally unclear for what you want to use the wall. The wall does not make territory, does not build a moyo and has no weak opponent group in front to attack. Worse, it is not too unlikely that you end in gote locally, so that white can play R8 to strengthen his right side group.]
;W[oq];B[qk]C[Bad direction? I wasn't sure about starting from r13, because the wall isn't very strong around q4 and I thought it would be like throwing the whole wall away for nothing.
Like this, I thought i was making the wall stronger, while r11 can still be attacked.

Or is the whole idea of attack r11 wrong and my l4 wall is just plain useless?

MR: Attacking R11 is the only sensible idea I see to do "something" with your wall. At the bottom, locally the problem is W P4, B P5, W Q5.]
;W[qf]
(;B[of]C[My plan here is clear, I want to push him against my wall and build something on the top. Is this a correct way of thinking or should i just leave him be for now and get some big point like k16?

MR: Strange direction. I would continue with P10. Driving the white group against the top edge is a good idea as you can make territory in the center and/or on the upper edge in the meantime.]
;W[oi]C[MR: This is the move white anyway wanted to play. It strengthens the white group and neutralizes your wall.]
;B[nh]C[MR: You again start to build a wall without having an extension (e.g. F17, F15).]
;W[ic]C[This was a surprise to me. What should I do here? I continued to attack, because that was my strategy and I thought if I won't follow it, I will lose, because I thought he was ahead. But now, as I look at it, he isn't much ahead. He has territory around m2, which looks the same as my shimari at r17 and except that, he doesn't have anything. And influence-wise, I think I am better here and he still has a not so strong group in the middle of my stones. So is black all right in this game?

MR: To me, the white move does not come as a surprise, as he wants to forstall your extension on the upper edge. 

In my opinion, white is better of in the game as a) he has the influence on the left side, b) he has territory on the lower edge with the option to cut off the lower right corner, c) black only has territory in the upper right corner and a wall on the lower side that he still has to make use of (i.e. it is not too difficult for white to make the wall useless).]
;B[ni];W[rk];B[rj]C[Not so sure about this move. But anything else is letting him have a definite base, which I didn't like.]
;W[qj];B[rl];W[pk]
(;B[sk]C[MR: R8 instead of T9 would be the standard continuation.]
;W[ql];B[qm];W[pl];B[pm];W[cj]C[He insisted on tenuki all the time. And it made me really nervous :-) Is that group of his really so strong and unimportant that he can just tenuki? I think black could attack more strongly now (and also sooner), push white really against his wall at l4 and make something in the center. However, I am not sure what's the best way to go about it.

MR: White's strategy is to take the big points on the board and to leave you with the situation that you either have to kill the group or at least have to enclose territory with your wall while attacking. 

I personally would play O8 to make the black center stones work together. However, white anyway can start the ko with S9. It appears to be difficult to really kill the white group.]

(;B[ri];W[nj];B[mj];W[nk];B[mk];W[om]
(;B[ie]C[I want to create a moyo here. It seems a bit amateurish and I know walls shouldn't be used like this, to create territory directly, but what else can I do? Maybe invade at f17, split his stones, and use the wall to attack j17? Is that possible?

MR: F17 seems strange to me as white can make an extension for his J17 stone with M17. The usual idea would be to invade at 3x3 (C17) in the corner and afterwards to cap with E10.]
;W[gd];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]
;W[cf];B[gf]C[MR: I see, similar idea ...];W[ej]C[E10 looks like a vital point, but I missed it. Should I have taken it, instead of g14?

MR: Yes.];B[gj];W[fm];B[hm];W[gh]
(;B[fi]C[Not sure about this move. I thought like this: "If white walks into my potential territory, I will walk into his."
But I have more potential I think, so this would be a bad trade for black. If so, what is the best way to defend the central territory?

MR: Not so easy. You have to calculate F12 and H12 and choose a variation that you can cope with.]

(;W[fg]C[MR: Should be at F12.];B[gg];W[fh];B[hh];W[gi];B[hi]
;W[fj]C[From here and later in the game, white played lot of small and unimportant moves, which is the reason I won later, I think. This is one of them. But maybe I am just missing some tesuji for invasion, so I will better ask the reviewer :-) Is it all right for white to tenuki here? Or did he just count with me to answer at g9 (which I did, but now I think that's unnecessary as well...).

MR: Ok, now you got one of the standard results of playing F11 directly - and one of that results that are good for black ...]
;B[gk]C[MR: Answering here is ok, I think.];W[ml];B[ll];W[lm]
;B[mm];W[nl];B[kl];W[je];B[jf];W[ke];B[id];W[jc];B[lc];W[kc]
;B[cq]C[Again, white ended in gote, so I could take his corner away.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[br];W[bq];B[cr];W[bp]C[This is a bad mistake, right? White should take r3 corner before black plays there...

MR: Yes, the black invasion at C3 should be gote for black.]
;B[pq];W[op]C[Another unimportant move?];B[ln]C[I captured firmly, but it looks completely unnecessary. A move like o6 is nicer, or even better, tenuki to something bigger?

MR: Why not simply P5?]

;W[pg];B[lb];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[pr]C[I think this move plus followup jump at o1 or n1 is bigger than white's s17. Is that correct?

MR: Sorry, I am not an endgame expert ...];W[or];B[gr]C[...and same about this one. If white tenukis, black can go to l2 and and even kill white. White should never have allowed this to happen...

MR: White can connect to the center. White should not allow you to play all these endgames in sente!]

;B[ee];W[df];B[mf];W[fb];B[da];W[lf];B[rc]C[MR: Game over. I guess you made about 10-15 points within the last couple of endgame moves. Now black will win the game.]
;W[ps];B[qs];W[os];B[qr];W[gp];B[go];W[hd];B[if];W[ld]C[I think this is quite small when compared with black's j19?

This is my last comment. I think I won this game, because white had a very bad yose and I got to very big points first. With that being the case, I think at first I was quite behind because of my unsuccessful attack. Is my analysis correct?]
