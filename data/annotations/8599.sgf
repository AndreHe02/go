Hi,

I'm Julian, and I'll be reviewing your game. 

I try to only comment where I feel I have solid reasons, and to the best of my ability I will give those reasons!  In my enthusiasm to be helpful though, and based on my own limited understanding, I'm sure I make mistakes though, so think about everything I say, and take it with a grain of salt!

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the review.  

All my comments will appear under a separator like the one above.  If there was text in the node before, it will be above the separator.

I will be reviewing the game for Black.

B took an early lead in this game, and maintained the lead throughout.  But B has expressed concerns that W had opportunities until the end of the game to win, and indeed, B passed up many oportunities to secure an overwhelming lead.

If there is a single lesson to learn from this game, it is be the importance of counting.  Professionals count the score constantly, and so should you!

Often, difficult decisions about which course to follow are easy if you know the score.  "Should I try to capture W's dragon?"  If I need to capture it to win, I should.  But if I can win instead by getting 10 points while I chase it, it is foolish to risk losing the game in hopes that I can capture it.  In this game, B created opportunities for W to win by playing an unecessarily risky strategy, when a simple count of the score would have made the game easy.

More importantly, you should count constantly, because counting is how you learn the value of moves.  As you get better at counting, moves that get you more points will start to feel right, and your game will improve.

I will attempt to point out how to use counting effectively in this game.]

;W[dd];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[jp];W[dj];B[fq]C[------------------------------
Up to this point, I really can't find anything to critique.  With a slightly different move order, this exact pattern has come up in at least one professional game!

While move order is important, nothing here reaches the threshold of what I can find a solid reason to comment on.

The game is even!];W[fp]MA[dj]C[------------------------------
This is, I think, the first really questionable move of the game.  I am reviewing the game for B, but this merits a little comment since it impacts much of the rest of the game.

This joseki normally leads to B having a well setled group on the bottom, and W having a wall.  W's wall should find itself too close to the marked stone.  Also, allowing B to settle his bottom group so easily substantially reduces the effectiveness of an invasion of B's moyo later.

B has taken an early lead.];B[gp];W[fo]
(;B[eq]MA[dj]LB[cq:a]C[------------------------------
A play at (a) is often best when W has the marked stone. (see variation)]
;W[dq]
(;B[dn]LB[po:b][iq:a]C[here white can punish with g3?

------------------------------
g3 doesn't work.  (see variation on next move)

B does leave a serious weakness, and he should be concerned about a play at (a), but W can't usefully invade there immediately.

I do think this is a questionable move though.  

At this stage in the game a play at or around (b) is very large, and this invasion is likely to end in gote letting W get there first.  The invasion, furthermore, has little prospect of securing territory for B, or of seriously threatening W's stones.  W should be thinking about how to keep B's stones off balance while he secures the corner and takes profit.]
(;W[do];B[dl]C[------------------------------
Good shape!];W[cn];B[cm]
(;W[en]C[------------------------------
B gets a little lucky here. (see variation)];B[ck];W[cj];B[bn]
;W[co];B[bl];W[bo]LB[ep:a]C[------------------------------
Another mistake by W, the corner isn't worth so many points, and B's group is no longer likely to be killed.

Since (a) is W's sente, and is gote for B, W doesn't need to fear for the life of his group.]
;B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[bq]LB[cf:d][jj:b][po:c][iq:a]C[------------------------------
W has made a series of mistakes, and now B has a solid advantage.  The weakness at (a), expanding his moyo around (b), finishing his shimari at (c), and some sort of invasion of W's moyo (d) should all be on B's mind now.

This is a good place to start counting.  Which of these moves is biggest?  Which one is going to make it easiest to win the game?]
(;B[cf]LB[jj:b][po:a]C[------------------------------
This invasion works out pretty well for B, but is premature.  Expanding his own moyo at (a) or (b) is much better.  

The most likely outcome of invading a moyo is to take a very small number of points while your opponent takes a moderate sized solid territory.  Differentially, you really don't come out ahead invading here unless W messes up.]
;W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[dh];W[ei]
(;B[ef]LB[gf:a]C[------------------------------
This move feels a little over concentrated, and invites W's response at (a)]
;W[gf];B[fg];W[gi];B[bc]MA[ef][fg]C[------------------------------
Now B's marked stones don't seem to serve much purpose.

W should ignore this move.];W[bb];B[cd];W[dc];B[hh];W[gg];B[gh]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[fi]MA[bf][cl][ae][be][am][bm]CR[ec][fo][cq][br]

[gb][gc][ha][hb][hc][ia][ib][ic][ja][jb][jc][bs][cs]C[------------------------------
This is another good moment to evaluate the board.  W has about 12 points of solid territory (circles), and good prospects at about 18 more points (squares).

B has very little solid territory, just about 6 points (crosses), but is dominating the rest of the board with his influence.  B simply needs to turn this influence into about 25 points of net profit to have a sure victory.

Estimating how much of the unclaimed territory B can expect is a matter of experience, but in this case, I think it's clear that B's influence over the remaining board is worth much more than the 25 points he needs to make win.

With such an early lead on the board, B should look into initiating yose as soon as possible.  Without some sort of upset, W has no hope.]
(;B[me];W[ld]CR[ka][kb][la][lb][ma][mb][kc][lc]C[------------------------------
B gives W about 8 points of solid territory in exchange for influence which he'll use to attack W's group.  B's lead is becoming less clear unless he captures W's stones.

It isn't entirely unreasonable for B to hope to capture W's stones, but note how this changes the our calculation from before.  Now B is going to need a net profit of closer to 33 points on the rest of the board.

They say that when you try to catch a dragon, there's a 2/3 chance it will escape.  If you have a 20 point lead, giving up 10 points to improve your 1/3 chance of catching a dragon is just a bad deal.]
;B[fl]C[------------------------------
Now B chases W into the center - a space that before was potential territory for B.

B is giving up more of his lead for a chance to chase the dragon.]
;W[ij];B[lg]LB[po:a]C[------------------------------
This move accomplishes relatively little.  B should be looking for ways to make points while chasing W.  That way, even if W escapes, B will have taken such a commanding lead in points that the game will be over.

A play at (a) is still urgent.];W[po]C[------------------------------
W gets to the critical point first.

The game is still very difficult for W as he'll have to balance his invading stone with the already weak dragon, but W has managed to complicate matters.]
(;B[pm]MA[qk]C[------------------------------
B should not pincer here.  The marked stone is sufficient to prevent W from settling comfortably, and B should settle his weak bottom instead. (see variation)]
;W[lq]LB[iq:a]C[------------------------------
B's weakness at (a) has become a significant worry.  W's stones are overextended, and this situation still heavily favors B, but there is no clear simple resolution.

The game is complicated now.];B[nq];W[lo];B[no];W[on];B[jq]

B is right to worry about this group, but keeping W separated is urgent.]

[rl][sl][qn][qo][bp][cp][aq][ar][as]LB[ob:a]C[------------------------------
At this point, I think B can no longer kill W unconditionally.

Time to count again!

Doing just a rough count of solid territory, W has about 42 points, and B has about the same, plus a couple more captures than W.  Looking at the unresolved territories, the upper left corner is clearly huge.  B should be looking to secure his large center group in sente, and get to (a) first.

Even if killing might be possible, what's clear is that if B finishes with sente, and beats W to (a), B will win the game.

Tactics come second to large scale strategic goals.  If you lose sight of those goals, simple situations can become very muddy.]

------------------------------
See the earlier comments and variations for some ideas.  I think at this point though, B has little hope of coming up with a better ko threat.

W has also take a number of points along the top while connecting.  The game is close now.  However, since B has sente, and a couple large moves remain, the game is still B's to lose.]
;W[eg]
(;B[ci]LB[ob:a]C[------------------------------
Is this move really needed?  

Unless W can kill B's stones here, the loss from letting W connect is only a few points. a move at (a) at this point is much larger.]

This is an overplay.  B needs to make sure his group can live.

W gets one last chance to win!

Was B short on time?  With the score as it is, B should really be making sure his groups are alive before trying to get every point he can in Yose!

If B had time to think, this was just careless!]
(;W[oa];B[nf];W[rf]MA[oa][nf]C[------------------------------
W has missed his chance with the exchange of the marked stones.  Except for a few remarks in the last node, my commentary ends here.]

On the whole this was a good game for B!

B took an early lead, and never really lost it.  In a way this review is all about how to win a won game.  Count.

One other thing I'd comment on is that B made a couple moves too close to his strength that led to cramped inefficient shapes.  Look at moves 59 and 100 and convince yourself they were bad!  When you see those moves on the board it should make your stomach uneasy!  If it doesn't, look at them some more.  Jump to the end of the game, and find those two stones.  What are they accomplishing?  Look back at moves 59 and 100.  Is your stomach uneasy now?

Ok, I think I've babbled enough!  I hope this review was helpful or at least not unpleasant.  I certainly enjoyed writing it!]

(;B[po];W[ec]C[------------------------------
Suppose both players reinforce their moyos. 

Try counting the territory enclosed by both moyos.

Note the neither moyo is beyond invasion yet.  Try imagining various invasions and estimate what sorts of territory each player is likely to wind up with.  This takes some practice, but will improve your game immensely.

B is getting the better end of the deal.])
(;B[jj]C[------------------------------
B expands his moyo on a large scale, while preparing to invade W's moyo.

If W invades immediately, B can hope to secure a large amount of territory in sente, and then launch his own counter invasion with backing.

Again, try to visualize the possibilties for B and W's final territories.  It's very speculative still, but you should try to get a feel for what this move is worth.

Purely territorially this is less valuable than completing the shimari, but since it also acts as a jumping off point for a more effective invasion of W's moyo, I like this move.

If W simply reinforces his moyo, B can do likewise.  His moyo is much larger.]
