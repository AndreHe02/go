C[    Hi ! I'm Tilwen, Black in this game. This game was played it for ASR League on KGS, then we review it a little bit after we played.  We weren't so sure about our feelings, so we wanted to have some thoughts from someone stronger.
  I played a San-ren-Sei, double pincer/san-san joseki and then he invaded.
  We would like to know where one of us went wrong, played a bad move or missed a big point. I put more particular questions in the file, but please feel free to tell your feeling even where there is no comment if you think it's helpful.
   Thanks.

[kb\]: I will do my best.  Patience and good judgment is key with a sanrensei opening.

You should take a look at http://lifein19x19.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=77638#p77638, it gives a decent introduction to some basics about the sanrensei.  I will keep my comments to the game.]

(;W[qc]C[[kb\]: White should jump here instead of invading the corner.  See variation.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me]C[[kb\]: This result is quite playable for Black.]
;W[nq]C[I guess this is standard, here he chooses to take san-san again, is it OK ?

[kb\]: Generally not, but Black's answer is not consistent with the sanrensei strategy; Black is hoping White will jump into the corner again.  See variations.]

(;B[lq];W[qq]C[A second time];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]
C[First question : we debated about R10 and O10, but this seems too early to me, I proposed to take a big point with C15, I guess Black won't play O10 at this point right ?

[kb\]: Black should be satisfied with this result.  This is a difficult game to play for both sides as in any omoyo strategy.

My recommendation might be different than other players', though-]

(;W[qj]C[He choose to invade that early.

[kb\]: OK, but it is too early.];B[qk];W[qi];B[rk];W[oh];B[nj]

(;B[ng]C[I guess up to here it can be expected, I was wondering about the O16 cut, maybe it's not much of a threat right now (see variation).]
;W[nh];B[jj]C[[kb\]: This move is very important.  I cannot find a good way for White to attack the top Black group - it seems the O13 exchange helps Black a lot.]
;W[pi]C[We didn't know about this move being wrong or just aji-keshi, what do you think ? Should Black respond, and if ignoring how to play ? (see variation)

[kb\]: Black should answer at Q9.  It is aji keshi for White.]

(;B[pk];W[ih];B[id]C[I started to think my upper group wasn't that safe, so I tried to make it stronger while attacking. Now white played D15, we were not sure it was good, and how Blac should keep on attacking. I proposed white G17, threatening to uproot Black, but then maybe Black can fight heavily J12 ?

[kb\]: This move is not bad - White has a hard time finding a good move.]

(;W[ce]C[[kb\]: This is a mistake in direction.  White must turn the central eyeless group into influence in order for it to be useful.]
;B[hj]C[I felt a bit like this helped White to connect, but then i get a big moyo.

[kb\]: This is the correct direction.];W[gh];B[fq]C[[kb\]: White should ignore this move - it is premature.  See variation.]

(;W[dn]C[[kb\]: Submissive.  See variation.];B[fo]
(;W[dr]C[[kb\]: Another mistake in direction.  The lower side is not worth much because of White's low stone at O2.]
;B[fm]TR[gr][hr][ir][jr][kr][gs][hs][is][js][ks]C[I considered all the triangled area as too open, my aim was to get a moyo in the center, and aiming at reducing/destroying the lower left corner.

[kb\]: It seems Black has taken 60 points without so much as a peep from White.  White barely has 40.]
;W[ck]C[White defended this way, I proposed C6 to keep corner, but then D12 area is open.

[kb\]: White is quite behind.  I am not sure what to recommend.  This is probably the best option.]

(;B[db]C[[kb\]: There is no reason to make it complicated.  Play F17 and win the game.  See variation for White.]

(;W[cb];B[cq]C[I think I could have lived here, what do you think of this sequence ?]
;W[dq];B[co];W[cp]C[[kb\]: See variation.]
(;B[do]C[Maybe B4 ?];W[cn];B[eo];W[bo];B[dd]C[[kb\]: The plan is wrong here, because there is no way to make profit while attacking the White dragon.  That is why F17 is better than something complicated.]
;W[cc];B[fd];W[fc];B[gc];W[fb]C[[kb\]: Black gave up a lot of points.  How do you profit from it.]
;B[fi];W[fh];B[ei];W[kf];B[lg];W[lh]
(;B[lf]C[I was afraid of the cut once more, but this feels really slow. Maybe R13 is fine ?

[kb\]: Black's shape is thin.  This move has a bad feeling to it. See variation.]
;W[hi];B[ii];W[ji];B[ij];W[gd]C[I guess here Black could have done damage to the center dragon ...]
;B[ge];W[hd];B[he];W[hc];B[ic];W[hb];B[fe];W[eh];B[fr]C[I felt this would be enough point to win, maybe I was wrong because I think white's yose wasn't that good.

[kb\]: This is a pretty slack play - D11 is still bigger, poking through the side and still attacking the White dragon.

You let White catch up a lot in the middle game by trying to make the game too complicated.  You should count before doing this - if you are safely ahead, continue to play solid moves that will win you the game for sure.

No further comments.];W[lr];B[kq];W[kr];B[jq];W[jr];B[cd];W[bd]
;B[de];W[cf];B[df]C[This is probably a mistake, I should play D11 it seems sente. I'm realizing I don't put lots of questions for white, but he would be pleased to know about his mistakes too :) .]
