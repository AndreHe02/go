C[Norman314 [4k\]: hi gg
meln [4k\]: hi, you too

HY: Hi, I am Hamato Yoshi, your reviewer. My comments begin with "HY". I enjoyed your game.]

C[HY: Since black has a chinese fuseki on the right, the top side is pretty important.  I would prefer to play a high, far pincer like A, to help keep an eye on the top.]

LB[nc:A][jd:B][di:C]C[HY: I would ignore this move for now and play elsewhere. Protecting at C2 would be big if the life of C6 was in doubt, but at the moment it is a pretty strong group.  Perhaps A, B, or C instead.  Since black has chinese on the right, I would much prefer playing on top to C, so my suggestion would be A or B.]
;W[cr];B[do]
(;W[bm]LB[jd:A][ci:C][di:B][cl:O_o]C[I think this ended up being an overplay -- the black group was too strong to attack effectively.


HY: Yes, black is too strong here at the moment. D5 is very good eye shape. It is not time to attack this group. Like I said earlier, I would tenuki to the top, but if you're going to play on the left you should instead defend the C8 stone with a play like B or C.]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[cm]
(;W[el];B[bl];W[dm];B[bk]C[What am I supposed to think about this result? I got a ponnuki, but it is floating without a base. Should I think of the ponnuki as weak or strong? In the game, it ended up behaving like a weak group, not a strong group.


HY:  It looks like a bad result, but I wouldn't be too disapointed with it.  The down side is black's group is now invincible on the bottom right.  These extra moves didn't do anything but force black to become invincible.  Don't force already strong groups to become even stronger.  Leave them for later.  If you had left the group like it was on move 21, it could still come into some trouble later in the game, and having a black group in that area to attack or threaten could be valuable later in the game.  At this point, however, black has just solidified his position.  In return, you got a ponnuki.  That's good, but as you pointed out not nearly as good as it sounds because it is a somewhat weak ponnuki (especially for a ponnuki) since it is so close to black's invinisible group.  I would treat this ponnuki very lightly.  If black tries to attack it aggressively, give it to him, but try to do so while taking the real points on the board.]
;W[jd]C[I played here because it is the last big opening point. But maybe it's better to strengthen my ponnuki instead so that it does not become a target of attack.


HY:  No, treat the ponnuki lightly for now.  THIS PLAY IS HUGE.  Like I said, with black's chinese fuseki on the right, the top is more than "the last big opening point."  That's a good enough reason to play it alone.  But the chinese fuskei works really well with support from either the top or bottom side, so taking this point away from black severely limits his chinese formation.]
;B[ci]LB[nc:B][qf:A]C[HY: This play puts a little pressure on your ponnuki, but it is slow (black's group there is already so strong) and in the wrong direction. You did well by ignoring it. Your play at A is much more important.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe]
;W[nc]C[Up to here is joseki for this corner];B[oc]C[My understanding is that this move is bad for black, it is aji keshi.

HY: You are correct.];W[ob];B[nd];W[mc];B[ng]C[I think this move is overconcentrated for black. Do you agree?

HY: Yes, I do.]
(;W[ip]LB[cf:A]C[But then this move might be overconcentrated for me. I am strong on both sides, so I don't need to fear an invasion. Probaby it's better to play in the top left?

HY: Well black is also strong on left side and right, so invasion is definitely possible.  But I agree that top left is bigger and a little more urgent at the moment.  Perhaps A for instance.]
;B[ei];W[gl]C[HY: Hmm. One one hand I really don't see the value in saving those four stones. They're not cutting stones; they're right next to a really strong black group; and they just don't seem all that useful. I would tenuki to top left corner or start limiting black on right. Keep those comments in mind as you read the next comment:

However, on a psychological level, this may be just what you need. It seems your opponent wants to attack these four stones. If he attacks well, he will use it to extend his right framework and to solidy further territory on the left.  But it doesn't seem like the right timing or direction for black to play at E11.  I think the E11 stone is a clue that black has made a mistake in direction, and playing along with his game may be a good way to reduce black's framework on the right.  If he chases you into his framework and is determined to kill you at all costs, it could prove to be a great opportunity to wreck his moyo.  Given the skill level of black and his mistaken direction at E11, I think you can pull this off.  If black was significantly stronger, I might not run here because he could clearly turn a weak running group into a huge advantage by correcting his mistake in direction.  But there is a psychological aspect to go, and I think it's worth hoping black will become blood thirsty here, and that could really be an advantage to you.

Summary: If you think black is trying to kill you, it is great to run because you can limit his moyo in his attempt to kill you.  However, if you think black doesn't care about killing you here but only wants to use you to build his moyo, it is bad to run here, and you should tenuki instead.]
;B[gn]C[HY: Black's next move is another indicator that he wants to kill, and it gives credence to your J4 play as well.]
;W[im]LB[il:A]C[HY: Hmm.  The proverb says "don't run with keima." I think the one point jump at A would be better.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[hp]C[In this sequence, black managed to press me very low on the bottom left, but I got a small moyo on the bottom right-center. Overall, I think I could have improved on this sequence, but I'm not sure how. How could I have played it better?]

;W[gq];B[hq];W[hr];B[fq];W[gr];B[ep];W[eq];B[fo];W[fr]C[HY: This result is GREAT for you. Don't worry about improving it. B got basically nothing for this, and now you have a big wall facing black's moyo.]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[nr];W[mq];B[oq];W[nn]LB[qm:A]C[HY: I think this is maybe overconcentrated. You are so strong here I would probably take the opportunity to invade now around A. If black tries to close it in, it can live.  If black tries to kick it out, it has a huge strong white wall to run to.]
;B[qm];W[ik]LB[gi:B][nk:A]C[I felt this move was necessary in order to prevent a cut, but maybe it was too slow?

HY: Yeah, how about A instead? It helps protect the cut a little from a distance, but it helps you grow and limits black.  Or if you're really worried about the cut, B is an option. It leaves the cut, but it gives white more options. If black cuts, white has easy access to the top. B also helps some to protect your top group from an invasion.]
;B[hc];W[gd];B[id]LB[jc:A]C[HY: A is a key point for black's shape.  I would take it. Keep black weak here.]

(;W[oh]C[This was a desperate invasion attempt which lost me the possibility of making stronger reducing moves.. I did not count carefully, and I thought I was behind by 20 or so points, when I actually just ended up losing by 10. Maybe if I'd just made patient reducing moves I could have won.

HY: Yes, it does look possible. Unfortunately, yose is not my strength. This is the last comment. Good game!]
