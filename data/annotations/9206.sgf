C[Hello!  My name is Justin, so I'll use  J:

This review is for W.  B was very aggressive and was always picking fights.  Besides a few mistakes, you defended quite well and as a result B found himself stretched thin and had to resign.  Your specific question about making more territory is addressed at the end, but I'll just add here that it would help to look for opportunities to ignore your enemy's moves and play elsewhere, especially during the opening stage.  You don't always need to respond to your enemy's moves.  Besides, nothing strikes more fear in the heart of the enemy than ignoring him!  =D]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[db]C[J:  This feels like overplay.  No need to worry, just stay calm, keep your groups safe and SLOWLY close in on him.  No rush.]
;W[eb]C[Smash: How to respond better?

J:  I tried a few things, but I like your response best.  This move is correct.  Your mistake came a little later.]
;B[ec];W[fb];B[fc];W[dc]C[J:  This is wrong.  Letting B escape by playing G17 is what gave B a chance to fight for the top.  See Variation.]

;B[nc];W[od];B[oc];W[pc];B[ng];W[ig]C[J:  This is too direct, too aggressive.  You can't hope to enclose B this way.  There's a saying I like:  "Never touch the stones you want to attack."  Ironically, touching an enemy stone usually makes it stronger.  Think more like G12 or H12.  Either way, it's easy for B to connect at K14 so I would've looked for something else to use my move for.]

;B[mh];W[nh];B[oh];W[ni];B[fg];W[fh];B[jl];W[ch]C[Smash: I was confused between 12c or 11c or 9g

J:  No, this is good.  Keeps the pressure on B's large dragon by denying him territory space on the left edge and gives you the chance to make a base yourself.  C11 does the same, but isn't as solid as this move.]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[bh]C[J:  B was very aggressive in this game.  Always picking fights.  This kind of strategy spreads his stones thin and leaves behind weak groups that he must defend later.  If you stay calm and just make sure your groups stay safe, you will reamin ahead.]

(;W[bg]LB[bg:A][cj:B]C[J:  I was curious if attacking C11 instead would give better results.  After playing it out, I'm still not sure.  What do you think?  =)]

;B[ip];W[jr]C[Smash: K2 or L3?

J:  Definitely not L3, that's too submissive.  K3 might be just a little stronger, but this is fine too.]
;B[io];W[ej];B[ao];W[ck]C[Smash: mistake

J:  Yep, overplay];B[dk];W[dl];B[cl];W[bk];B[bl];W[ei];B[dj]
;W[fj];B[qf];W[qe];B[qg];W[rg];B[rh];W[pr]C[Smash: to attack black in the corner or close him in the corner?

J:  This is good.  Threatens to wrap around B's corner while extending your own territory a little.  You might be able to invade on the right side, but you don't have much room and no hope of escape.  Trying to cut around Q6 is probably worse.  I think Q2 is best.]
;B[or];W[oq];B[nr]
(;W[pq]LB[pq:A][mr:B]C[J:  BIG mistake.  Let's B escape and destroys all of your territory.  You're still winning this fight.  More important to keep attacking B's 2 stones than to defend your own.]

C[Result: W+R

You asked how to make more territory instead of living in the center with just two eyes.  Well, I think you underestimate how well you did in this game.  I finished it out and W was ahead by 80-100 pts!  Big moyos and vast swaths of empty territory are comfortable, but they're also sometimes a luxury.  The result of a respectful and cautious game without much fighting.  However when your opponent chooses to fight you at every turn, you often have no choice but to defend and make two eyes.  But what usually happens is, if you can keep your groups alive, your enemy's groups will die.  If not, it will be a very close and exciting game  =D]
