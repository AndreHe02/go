;B[pd];W[dq];B[oq];W[qo];B[pp]C[R4 would be better...you open the door to r4 as your W played.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[pq];B[qq]C[R3 is a bit ambitious....if this is followed by W Q2, regardless of where you play (P2 or R2) the next white move will put pressure on you and you may be capture.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[rr]C[Bad move by white....you should play at R2..and capture (only if necessary)]
;B[rp]C[Black bad move...white should play s3];W[ro]C[here you could still play r2 (and capture)]
;B[qn];W[rq];B[rn];W[sp];B[sn]C[This move helps you but not enough.....think about making a big move like  d16...or q10.]
;W[so]C[weak move for white....same reason.....much better D16.....this group has two eyes whether you play T5 or white plays T5.....]
;B[ps]C[weak move];W[qr];B[os];W[ec]C[good move by white];B[pk]
C[Q5 is the right idea....it does gain area....but there are still big moves on the board.....D15...or C16...This type of move MUST be answered by white in the C17 area...or you move in the area....If white does move in C17, you move down (from c16 to c13). This type of move is very important because it provides a base for you to work from that you can enter the center with (and you have no fear because you have room for eyes. 

Another big move is at D10....followed by D13 or D7..same reason]
;W[jc]C[the right idea....];B[pg]C[This move does capture area...but again there are bigger areas to be concerned about]
;W[cd]C[Godd move....makes two eyes fairly easily...and opens the door to play around D13]
;B[mc];W[me];B[nd]C[good move];W[jq]C[Note that your 12 stones around Q4 are not secure. If white plays Q6....this attacks RST6 if followed by white Q7.....

White Q6 also attacks P123Q1......if followed by O4, it places pressure on you]
;B[pn]C[this type of move is unfortunate...it does protect you...but allows white to grab more area on left]
;W[mg]C[Bigger play at D10...];B[nk]C[small play...if not in D10 area.....how about near M4

This captures area.....and moves you out in the middle also]
;W[lk];B[nm]C[note the circle enclosure white has...all around H13....you must somehow enter that area (and live)

I would go to D10];W[lm];B[dj]C[good move!!];W[dh];B[dl]C[No...you need room for two eyes...jump to D7..or C7]
;W[dn];B[cm]C[good];W[cn];B[bm];W[fl];B[ci]C[No....you can make two eyes...by either the move you made or by b6,,,you need to break into the center.

There are many times you need to play "on the edge" and not protect yourself until it is NECESSARY....if you can attack (and not be killed) your opponent must respond (and not attack). It takes awhile to do this because in the beginning you are not sure if you are safe.

If white played at C11, you could play C10, etc.];W[ch];B[bi]
;W[fj];B[kf]C[This move is good...it places pressure on a breakthrough...and it places pressure on K26.....and it allows an attackfrom E11.....and an attack at M11 or N11]
;W[ke];B[le]C[I would have played at M14...this allows you to push through at either M16 or N14...white can not block both]
;W[lf]C[trouble];B[ld];W[kd];B[md]C[no...this connection was secure....at either N16 or M17.....if white plays one...you play the other.

It was key here that you make the most of every move (in a fight)]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[if];B[kc]C[No...this cost you the capture of L13,14...better at K12]
;W[lh];B[je];W[jd];B[jf];W[ie];B[kh]C[Better at K12];W[ki];B[ji]
;W[jh];B[li];W[jg]C[Note the whole board...white has huge area upper leftand big area lower middle / left

Blacks area will shrink on right (white P14)];B[kj];W[kh];B[lj]
;W[jj];B[mj]C[Without this move you can connect...a little on the edge...but OK...You could have kept the pressure on by playingL9 instead]
;W[kk];B[nj]C[you are guaranted a connection by either O10 or N9

You need to fight for the center....Play at E11...

A play at H3 attacks the K3 stone and allows a stone later at E3.....and follow out with either F11 or E12

Also If you played at J4, this would probably be followed by W J3.....B H4...

It also allows a cut at E7 attacking CD6....and breaking into the center with either E6 Or F7..........

Bpth these moves put a lot of pressure on the CD6 goup, the CD12 group, and the F8,10 group.....It will be very difficult to defend all three groups.]
;W[ne];B[od];W[oe];B[pe];W[og];B[pf];W[of];B[ml]C[this moves solidifies your wall...and it will also solidify the white wall (and help enclose a big white area).......

You need a bigger move....again a move at M4 or M5 threatens to invade the big white area....when white blocks your attack, it will build a wall (and territory for you.]
;W[mi]C[small move for white...if you play O11, it strengthens your connection...and white should answer.]
;B[ll];W[kl];B[km];W[ln];B[kn];W[lo]C[how about playing K9?...you either capture K10 (and break into the center).....or you capture L8,9M9 group (and break into center.

You are aware that there is a weakness if white plays P4.....however, given the current situation, you can capture the invading stone.]
;B[ko];W[kp];B[lp];W[mp];B[lq];W[mq];B[mr];W[lr];B[mm];W[jm]
;B[mn]C[No....play at N5 guarantees capture of M5,6,7 group and connects 3 groups.]
;W[mo];B[no];W[jo];B[op];W[nr];B[ms]C[good move....he can not cut]
;W[nq];B[ns];W[kq];B[np]C[Black O4 is very little value...you can connect at P5 if necessary.....compare this to the value of you breaking through at E7 or E11]
;W[oi];B[pi];W[ph];B[qh];W[oh];B[pj];W[ni]C[White O11 is low value move....white could play at E11 or E7 also]
;B[qi]C[Solid...but not necessary];W[ii]C[this capture is weak also....white could have effectively captured this by playing at E11...how could black make two eyes?]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[ka];W[ja];B[dd];W[dc];B[cc];W[de];B[ed];W[fd]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[ce];W[fe];B[bd];W[dd];B[cb];W[be];B[ad];W[cf]
;B[bc]C[better at D18];W[db];B[ca];W[ab];B[aa];W[ls]C[you could probably live in the upper left corner, by playing B18, white captures with B19...you play A17....and white can not play A19 (suicide not allowed)....and you capture before outside liberties are removed.

whites move at M1 is worth very little...again what about E7....

If black moves at C3 it might be interesting......white would have to be concerned about protecting the corner.....and connecting withB6]
;B[cp]C[I like this move...you may not be successful (and you might be successful) but it may also help you break more strongly out at E7]
;W[bq];B[cq];W[bn];B[am];W[dp];B[bp];W[ap];B[aq]C[not a good move...take your time...how about B2.....followed by A5....for capture]
;W[ar];B[cr];W[br];B[bs];W[dr];B[ds]C[How about a5 instead]
;W[es];B[cs];W[co];B[ao];W[an];B[aq];W[bo];B[as];W[ap];B[jk]
C[wasted move...b2 makes two eyes......this also threatensE2.......]
;W[br];B[ao]C[Wasted move...you are dead...unless you capture the outside]
;W[bk];B[dk];W[dm];B[cl];W[di];B[cj];W[bh];B[ai];W[ik]C[i think you need to playA9 to save that group]
;B[jl]C[wasted move....removes threat. Save these kinds of moves for doing Ko threats]
;W[il];B[mk]C[consider playing E2...force white to run or be captured...then play E7...and start moving down E6,5]
;W[ek];B[oj];W[ap]C[white capture is waste...black is dead (unless outside is captured...white should protect E1 by playing F2]
;B[qg]C[not neccesary...waste move and cost black a point];W[ao]
;B[ae];W[af];B[ah];W[bg];B[ag];W[bf];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt];B[qs]
;W[bb];B[ac]C[waste...black is dead];W[da];B[rs];W[eq];B[sr]
;W[ba]C[wasted move...and cost white one point...black was dead]
;B[fs];W[er];B[ss];W[ej];B[sq]C[wasted move...this group has two eyes]
;W[el];B[tt];W[em]C[wasted move...ladder would trap black at E7]
;B[tt];W[ho]C[wasted move...and cost white a point];B[tt];W[in]
C[wasted move...and cost white a point];B[tt];W[eo]C[wasted move...and cost white a point]
