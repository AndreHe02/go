Hi panda

I am Eric and I got this review request.  I am only 1k on kgs so some of your questions may be beyond me.

Related anecdote:  At rao's coffee house out here I sometimes play Trevor Morris who is 4d I think  on kgs and 7d in aga.  I ask him questions during our games like "is this move good ?  or would this one be better ?"

I always hope for a definitive answer.  But all too often, he says "I don't know.  Go is hard !"


> My style of play is building influence and some nice moyos and fight 
> as hard as I can when my opponent invades. That didn't worked here...

What does "fight as hard as I can when my opponent invades" mean ?

If it means you depend on killing the invader in order to win the game, it sounds too risky as a strategy.

Perhaps we need to look at what you mean by "nice moyo".  If it just means "large", it might be insufficient since it might be too easy for opponent to invade profitably.

Maybe for a moyo to be "nice" it should be large but also hard for opponent to invade and make a stable base.

For example, the first 3 black moves of the chinese opening are situated such that the opponent finds it hard to invade and make safety.  So that might be considered a "nice moyo".]
(;B[cn]LB[op:A]C[I thought the first kakari should be from the outside. That seemed more simple for me. But I thought about this move at A(P4) as well.

e:

I am not strong enough to give a definitive answer.

In favor of your move would be the fact that it has a relationship with upper left stone

In favor of "A" is that corners are more easily defended than elsewhere on the board (translation:  more profit available with less moves, given two natural boundaries to help) so challenging an unfinished corner might be better than challenging a 4-4 stone.]
;W[fp];B[dj]C[
Here's where we might see an example of what I meant by "nice moyo".  F7 instead of D10 makes a larger moyo, but maybe your D10 is "nicer" because if F7, the opponent can invade at C11 and make a base at either C8 or or C14 whereas after black D10, opponent can't make comfortable base anywhere.]
;W[fc]
(;B[hc]LB[df:A]C[Pincer seemed for me the most reasonable move. A move at A looked very comlicated to me.

Complicated as a white response to H17 or instead of H17 ?]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[fb];B[ge];W[qf]C[Would a pincer work here? Since I was interested in the terrytory at the top and because of white's komoku at the lower right, I decided to pull back in an easy way and build up my framework.]
;B[nd]C[
Some moves I'm not qualified to discuss.  Yours may be fine.  But it occurs to me that Q14 instead of O16 might be good, to build a larger moyo and press white down.  I don't know though !

After O16 , black's moyo grows with P13 o O12, but it's white's move so white can grow his and shrink yours with O13.

I'd love to ask a strong player these questions.];W[pj]LB[np:C]
[op:B][hq:E][kq:A][oq:D]C[I don't know how to decide where Black should play next. I figured out from videos and tutorials that a splitting move at A is seen as very modern nowadays. But what is the meaning of a splitting move and what about kakari directly the komoku stone?

Given that corners are often considered the first place to grab, before sides, and before center, it would seem that P3 or P4 are the important ponts.  If black plays L3 or H3, white might calmly play P3 or P4 himself.]
;B[kq];W[iq]C[
But he didn't !];B[op]C[I thought a combination of an extension and forceful high kakari  would be very efficient.]
;W[oq]C[
I think because white has this P3, I might have considered P3 instead of P4, but I'm not qualified to say for sure.

Who knows, maybe black O3 better, to make a base, the idea being if white responds to it at Q3, then black can invade at C4.

On the other hand, again who knows ?  Since R17 and C3 invasions are both available, maybe they are miai so neither player should be in a rush to take either one ?  Unless of course they are considered "sente invasions".]
;B[nq];W[pq];B[nn]LB[np:A]SQ[kq]C[Playing this move at A, I would feel very uncormfortable because the marked stone is too close. So I decided to play light and fast, although I leave bad aji with this position.

If you really believe the "aji" is bad" (and I don't know if it is), then you should question earlier moves.  Why leave "bad aji" around , unless you feel you "got something" for it ?]
;W[pn]C[
One thing that occurs to me, is that maybe black O4 would have been ok, because although black is "small", he is solid, so can look forward to either g3 invasion or r8 invasion.  But if black doesn't feel he is solid, he might feel compelled to defend after white q6, so he might not get chance for g3 invasion.]
;B[ph]LB[og:A]C[I thought I have to take some advantage on the right and build up more influence to enlarge my moyo in the top/right side. Maybe this was to deep? But i wanted to play severe moves and keep sente.

Interesting that you should ask whether it is too deep.

Another possibility is that black should either go even deeper at R12, or play something like your P13, to try to make moyo on top.]
;W[qh];B[qi];W[pi];B[qg];W[rh]C[
maybe this white s12 is not the best.  not sure, but cerntainly one should think about white q13 instead, an if black captures, then white p11 atari.]
;B[pg];W[rg];B[pf];W[lc]C[
I'm not strong enough to know whether black's moyo is "nice" .  If it is, then black should be able to make good profit by attacking M17.  If moyo isn't "nice" then M17 might demonstrate why.]
;B[le]C[To cap was the only move for me. I wanted to seal white in and strengthen my influence towards the center.

The thing is, maybe the cap lets white live too easily, such as with slide to o18 followed by k17, which further threatens the h17 stone, plus threatens to jump out to k15 into black's center.

Also, white'd q11 stones already are facing into the center.

I think instead of m15, i would have considered n17 , and assuming white answers at m16 or m15, then black r15 atari, the theory being that upper right would then no longe be invadable.

For white's part, maybe instead of m17, maybe r15 is important (and if so, the black r15 atari is also important as mentioned)]
;W[jc];B[ib]C[
this j18 is inconsistent.  You said you played m15 to build the center.  so wouldn't you have to answer k17 at k15 or k15 instead of j18 ???

the h17 and j18 stones might get cut off  !];W[je];B[kd];W[jd]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[ip]LB[if:A]C[This leaning attack was to prepare the fight above. But it ended in gote for me. Maybe it would be better to attack directly at around A?

seems hard to attack since white threatens the h16 cut.

time to attack was earlier as mentioned, i think.

since black felt there is "bad aji" in lower right, j4, invites that aji to get more dangerous i think.

maybe instead of j4, i'd consider c4 invasion, or e6 moyo building.

I think black needs some cash !];W[hp];B[io]C[
white let black strengthen the lower right.

what if white had played h3 or k4 instead of h4 ?

if white h3 and black k4, white has sente to continue operations up top.  

I'm not as sure about white k4.];W[jq];B[kp];W[jg];B[ji]C[
still seems a bit uncertain as an attack with the h16 cut possible.]
;W[hf]C[
what if white h16 instead of h14 ?];B[gf];W[gd]C[too much bad aji for me to handle.]
;B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[mb];B[hd];W[he];B[ka];W[lb];B[kf];W[oc]
C[I already gave up after this move. My opponent was too strong. I made heavy losses at the top and gained nothing from those exchanges. But I wanted to play out and see how the game will progress.


it's not clear that black loses this game !  black lost one group up top, and still has big prospects on left.

I played out some moves in some variations here.
