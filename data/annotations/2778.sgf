C[Telach : Here is a game that I won by a small margin, I felt like I was playing at my full capacity and that this game could easily have been lost so I would appreciate any views on obvious weaknesses and bad moves. Thanks.

LoP: I think you played better than you opponent in this game. You succeded in countering white's influence-based strategy and managed to punish white's mistakes in direction. Sometimes you played endgame moves in the middle game or fuseki, where you could take sente to play big points. Once you overcome the mistake of playing endgame moves too early and that way losing the initiative you will be single digit kyu in no time.]

(;W[hd]C[LoP: Way too close to the wall, white is really overconcentrated here]

(;B[np]C[LoP: I think this is not important right now, black should move against a white moyo on the top.
White's strengh at J4 makes O4 pretty useless, white can still mess up the corner with something like N3 or P3 or R3. So one can say the white strengh of J4 makes the bottom right area uninteresting.]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[LoP: I'd prefer a high pincer instead. The low pincer will come under attack because white is so strong on the left, also H16 will help white in the attack]
