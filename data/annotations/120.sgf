KM[0.5];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[cd];B[nq];W[pj]C[this move doesn't look good?

Ak: This move is ok, R10 or R9 are ok too. It is often considered more urgent  to
extend between a hoshi stone and a shimari (like on this side) than between  two hoshis (like on left side)]
;B[ec];W[df];B[hd];W[dc];B[ed];W[mc];B[kc]C[should be Q8 or something?

AK: Could be, but B group would be severely constrained after K17, L17 seems  ok]

(;W[fp]C[AK: This approach is not good :
- it is on the wrong side ( variation B)
- A high approach is ok when you are building a moyo, which is not the case  here.
the low approach (F3 here) is in general more flexible];B[dn];W[dq];B[cq]

(;W[po]C[AK: this move is terrible. You remove all possibilities in the corner, and  your benefits are almost zero. If the idea is to defend your group in sente,  it is better to play R5 at least.   But P11 is much more important in this area (variation B)]

The whole sequence seems quit a loss for b];W[bk];B[fj];W[bi]C[better to play  f14 or something?

AK: No, F8 is the natural move here. F14 does not have any effects on the  upper side group]

AK: it seems possible for B. Either he takes some territory from W, or he can  continue to build his center moyo]

AK:  They are alive (see after)

Furthermore, I think b will be far behind if w has time to play around K10.  So b does not have the time to resolve Q14 group status (see after)]
;W[br];B[bo];W[je];B[id];W[rg]C[Black must die?
AK: since T15 is sente against the upper group, b must be careful. He can get  a ko (var B)

But the game sequence is better for him, since he can live

Locally, w S11 b S12 w S10 is better and sente for w.

but globally, w should play around K10]
