C[Things go really bad for me later in the game when I try to invade.  Invasion I feel is one of my weaker points.  Thanks for the review!

T : Hi, I am Tilwen, my comments will start with "T".];B[pd]
C[razmataz [7k\]: you too];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[nc];B[nd]
;W[po]C[T : White already tries to complicate things. I would suggest to keep it rather simple, remember that White has two groups he needs to take care about.]
;B[np];W[md];B[ne]
(;W[lc]C[T : This is not joseki, White is supposed to play at P17 (it also protects the cut). Now I think that Black must take P17 and make a big solid corner (see variations).]

(;B[on]C[Is this too passive?  My plan was to make a wall pointing towards the left, but with the white stone already there maybe not a great idea.  Also think I could of punished that invasion more if I played it on the Q7 or R7 line.

T : The thing is that White Q5 is already weak, and I think that even with P6 you can't really hope to kill it. The idea is OK (and if you really want to play in this area, I like this move) but in my opinion P17 is bigger.]
;W[qq]
(;B[pp]C[T : This is bad shape, see variation.];W[qp]
(;B[qn]C[T : And this is an overplay I think. Remember that killing is a very hard thing, especially early in the opening as here. You should learn to appreciate the happiness of letting an opponent group live very small in gote.]
;W[qo];B[oc];W[pi]C[T : White overplays here.];B[pg];W[ni];B[nk]
;W[pn]C[I think here it would have been better to extend to P7 instaed.  The point of P6 was to build a wall and white probably lives in the corner anyhow so should have sacrificed R6...maybe?]

(;B[qm];W[pm];B[ql];W[ol];B[ok];W[nl];B[mk];W[li]C[T : Now White's lower group goes out and threaten your groups. This is a big difference, White is happy here (even your lower group can start to be weak now …)]
;B[ml];W[mn];B[mm];W[oo];B[lo];W[ln];B[ko];W[km];B[kk];W[ik]
;B[jm];W[kl];B[jl];W[jk];B[kn];W[lk];B[lm];W[kj];B[nn]C[I was lucky to save that P9 group here I think


T : Yep, Black is happy to link these groups. On the other hand White makes a very nice center. Game is good for White now (even the possible atari at O18 is not that much threatening now).]
;W[pr];B[fp];W[hp]C[T : White overplays again and again :-) .]

(;B[hn]C[T : The shape is strange in fact. Why not a keima ? I show some possibilities (I didn't look at every possibility, try and see yourself if this works).]
;W[jn];B[jo]C[T : Good decision here, your two stones are not that big now (White center group is already very strong), and the bottom is more important.]
;W[in];B[io];W[im];B[hm]C[T : Maybe this last atari isn't useful, you lose a potential ko threat (we say that the move is aji-keshi, you lose a possibility of aji and gain very few).]
;W[il]
(;B[fq];W[go];B[en];W[fo];B[eo];W[ep];B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[iq]C[T : This seems like it can be cut. Why not H2 simply ?]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[gr];B[ir];W[fr]C[T : This looks like White captures the Black stone. Game is getting worse again.]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[er];W[gq];B[ho];W[cr];B[fn];W[es];B[gn]C[T : This is also aji-keshi, White cannot cut you so don't force the exchange.]
;W[gp];B[dg]C[Here is where things go way downhill for me.  Any advice on how I could have invaded better would be great.

T : This approach is not standard, you can try the classical C14 instead. Game is hard for Black but who knows ?]

(;W[di]C[T : White likes overplays. If he plays just F17 I see game over.]

(;B[fd]C[T : You go to a difficult fight, you are late so why not, but I think san-san is OK here (see variation).]
;W[ee];B[jc];W[lf]C[T : This is a big point. Now the san-san isn't enough any more and I think game is about to be over.]

;B[fi];W[fk];B[ej];W[ek];B[dj];W[dk];B[ci];W[dh];B[ch];W[eg]
;B[bg];W[gh]C[T : This is a big achievement already, but you need to connect at C10 at some moment.]
;B[fh];W[fg];B[gg];W[hh];B[ii]C[T : This cannot work I guess.]

;W[hf];B[mh];W[mi];B[lh];W[kh];B[kg];W[lg];B[ng];W[kf];B[jg]
;W[jf];B[if]C[T : I hope my comments have helped you. To summarize, the main mistakes were :

- Move 13, I suggest P17 first and then see how White manages his weak group on the bottom

- Move 15, bad shape, the hane is better, then trying to kill with the move 17 is an overplay

- Move 25, you save a stone that is not worth it, and you get your groups separated,

- Moves 55 and 63, you may need stronger shapes, and 71 is an overextension

- Move 87 is strange approch, it doesn't really threaten the corner. In the following I guesse that you were confused because of the game going not well.

Also, remember not to play aji-keshi moves as 61 and 85.];W[je]

lizard [6k\]: just a game
razmataz [7k\]: yeah one I can hopefully learn something from
lizard [6k\]: i too many times bfore
razmataz [7k\]: more to learn from the games you lose than the ones you win

(;B[om];W[oo];B[no]C[T : This seems like a better idea indeed. I think that the lower right White group is rather alive so that R6 is not very important. If you make strength it is probably enough, you will attack O11 and gain profit. What can White do now ?]

(;B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[qm]C[T : Black has potential cutting points, and Q9 is high so you can't expect to kill. But you can now play F3 to have a nice bottom area, even if letting P17 unplayed seems strange to me.]
