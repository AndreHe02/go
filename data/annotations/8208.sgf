;B[dn];W[fp];B[di];W[fd]C[B: I think this invasion is unwise for W. W should rather play around l4.]
;B[df]C[B: I can now use W's invasion to secure territory, while W is on the run.

This was a poor invasion on W's part, I agree.  F17 might have been better, but could easily be pincered at H17 and again you secure territory.  W probably should have followed suit and played at L4 or something along those lines.]
;W[ff];B[ec];W[fc];B[hc];W[he];B[eb];W[fb];B[hb];W[jf]C[W is, however, doing a good job of gathering influence.  The sides have primarily been conquered (minus the bottom), so thinking about moving into the middle with something like F12 or F6 might not be a bad idea.]
;B[nf]C[B: I think this move is important. It separates teh W groups and prevent W from building a very big moyo.

Seperation is generally unimportant unless one or both of the groups are struggling for life.  W's group on the side is alive, while the group on the left has room to grow and plenty of eye space.  However, the idea of stretching to the middle applies here, allowing you to stretch in the middle from two fronts, while W moving there would have sealed you off from most of the board so that thinking is correct.]
;W[oh];B[lq]C[B: this is an easy invasion for B and prevent W getting a very big moyo.

This was actually necessary at this point.  If W had played L4 instead of O12, you sould be in serious trouble with W having the greatest influence in the center and you would be tied for territory on the outside.]
;W[jp];B[oq];W[qm];B[qq];W[rq];B[qr];W[eh];B[dh];W[ei];B[dk]
;W[ej];B[ek]C[B: Again, I think this is a key move. It helps to keep the W groups separated.

At this point in the game, it is important to notice that W is clearly trying to beat you on the influence side and sacrificing territory in the process.  W is actually ahead due to the massive influence.  This move prevents you from being locked out of the middle, and that is it's key feature.]
;W[fk]C[Now you only have a few entry points into the middle which can easily be slowed and stopped before doing much damage.  W is in a very good position right now.]
;B[fl];W[gk];B[gl]C[B43: W is getting a big moyo and what looks like a lot of center territory. Time to count.
B:
TL+ML:12+27+7
MT+TR:27+6+3
BR:8
B Total:90

W:
CTL:15+5+3
MR+BR:20+9
BL:30
W Total:82

This is a generous estimate for W. B's territory is much more solid.

So, I think I can play conservatively for now. Possible invasion at c3. B needs to get out at m13, p5, and g8, so as to reduce this center territory. The W k4 stone might be a good target later on.

I'm not sure where you are getting these numbers from.  Good spotting of the invasions, I actually read this after I made the variation and you saw most of the same I saw.  That variation I made in about 5 mins, so there are probably some mistakes and is just meant as a general idea that it could still wind up closer than you seem to think.  The invasion at C3 would need to be carefully considered because it might give W the strength to attack you're lower right group.  Keep in mind that at this point both your left side and W's bottom have an open skirt that should be utilized to greatly reduce territory (or protect) when the center is more settled.  I would do that before invading at C3, since with the support of F4 you'll probably end up living small and giving white too much strength.]
(;W[hl];B[pp];W[qo];B[lg];W[kh];B[lh]C[B49: Important move. I also considered: k10, k9, k8, h5, l4, m5, q5, s2, h3, h4, h5, c3, f5, e5.
I feel m12 is urgent, because if W plays there, then he gets a big moyo. I think W will respond.

k10 might have worked earlier when you had 3 places to run to, but here would have been a mistake as well as K9 or K8.  It might work at the 16k level, but higher up a stone like that won't survive without more support.

h5 could be cut easily, but may lead to an interesting battle.  Not sure how it would turn out.

I like L5 better than L4, M5, and Q5.

S2 is endgame, there are bigger points.

H3 is interesting and better than H5, not really sure how to respond best as white without losing everything.

F5 and E5 are two slow.  I'd play H6 to be more severe, and set up the attack at H3 to be even more severe.

Long story short though, I agree that M12 is urgent.  The rest would be consideration for the next move.]
;W[li];B[ho];W[in];B[hm]C[B53: Perhaps I can get a cut at h9 or j8. Might lose h5. Might get an opportunity to attack k4.

That would take advantage of the aji.  H3 now could cause some serious trouble for W.]
;W[im];B[il]C[Perhaps a bit ajikeshi.  Dunno where else you could use it though, but I guess thats the idea of aji.]
;W[hk];B[jl]C[B: I think getting this cut and making good use of it sealed the game for B.

I'll comment on that when I see it.  I see those stones as dead right now.]
;W[hn]C[L6 would do some serious damage to your stones and begin the connection to a living group on the right.]
;B[gm]C[B59: I think it is more important to keep the j6 W group separate from the h9 W group, than the d4 f4 stones. I need to connect k8 to m3 p3 stones. Thereby separating the weak W groups from the strong groups.

I missed that, I guess you're right in that G7 would cause you some serious trouble.  If I were white though I would start heading tot he right as I mentioned earlier to counter exactly that.  If you succed in that, you would easily win since the only thing that is keeping white alive is the center.]
;W[gn];B[lm]
(;W[lo];B[mn];W[mo];B[on]C[This was needed at E7.  This will cost you later in the game when white invades this side.]
(;W[ol]TR[on][pp][oq]C[Strong shape and now you're connected.  See vars to see how I might have seperated the two groups still, primarily with the early intervention.  This here is what cost white the game, because the group is alive and connected (albeit barely) and now you have the support to push deeper into W's territory.]
;B[no];W[kq];B[lr];W[kr];B[kn]TR[jl][lm]C[B71: I want to play f6. But I think it is more important to play l6, which can't be ignored. this will strengthen the weak point in my invading group.

Yes, very important.  This shape is also a strong connection, while the knights move could have still been cut.]
;W[jo];B[jj]C[Very good.  I just noticed that the bottom right group has an issue with N5, something W didn't capitilize on.  I'm not sure the best way to do it, but see the vars for some ideas of what I was seeing and what maybe you should worry about.]
(;W[ii];B[ij];W[hj];B[ji];W[ih];B[jh];W[jg];B[ke];W[kf];B[lf]
;W[je];B[kd]C[I like M15 better in general, but in this case this is good shape and strengths K16 in case of further invasion.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[hd];B[lj];W[mi];B[nj];W[ni];B[ok];W[pk];B[nl]
C[I don't really know what white is thinking at this point (maybe just gave up) but good end game, consistently inching your way in with sente.]
;W[oj];B[nk];W[pl];B[pn];W[qn];B[ko];W[mj];B[lk]C[B: Up to here, I was fairly happy with my game. But I am sure that I made a few mistakes, because W take sente from here for the next 21 moves and make a fairly big invasion and secures the lower left corner. This nearly cost me the game. Luckily for B, W makes some big mistakes in the end game.]

C[Not much you could have done at this point.  It is possible that this was bigger than some move that you made previously, but I didn't really notice.  Maybe when you first started pushing into the middle (at k10 or wherever you first pushed) this would be bigger.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[en];B[re]C[I take sente from here, but most of the big points are taken already.

It's definitely late midgame now, just keep sente and inch through the small stuff.  The game is still pretty much even now that you lost the majority of the side.  Your upper left about equals W's middle, the upper right and upper left about equal, and your middle and W's right about equal so you're pretty even (Score est. says B+0.5)]
