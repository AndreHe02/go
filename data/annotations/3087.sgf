;B[pp];W[dc];B[pd];W[cp];B[ep]C[i was planning to play the sanrensei but i read in my fuseki book that when the other player plays 3-4 facing my 4-4 , the next few moves or pattern is the best way to go.]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[dm]C[Zakalwe: this white move should be at C6.]
;B[jp]C[i think i could have play 11 one point to the right.

Zakalwe: i think K4 is better than L4. K4 is the standard extension for the F4 stones.]
;W[qn]
(;B[np]C[Zakalwe: A pincer would be a better move, it would work well with your Q16 stone. (see variations)]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[pk]C[R9 is stronger for white];B[cf]C[i play this long keima because i was afraid white could have played a pincer and then work well with the white group at the bottom left.

Zakalwe: I think you're right];W[ce]C[Zakalwe: bad move from white.]
;B[de];W[cd];B[df]
(;W[gd];B[cj]C[Zakalwe: white let black settle too easily. Now there's no points for white on the left side.]
;W[nc]
(;B[kc]C[Zakalwe: this is dangerous, because black have now 2 weak groups (L17 and Q16). I would prefer playing R14 to settle the corner, and reduce white next (see variations).
But i guess you can play this pincer, the following will be more flexible and lightly.]
;W[qc]C[Zakalwe: white should split black with O15];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[qe]C[Zakalwe: because of O17, you can't play this move. see variation]

(;W[re]C[Zakalwe: this would have been right if white didn't have the O17 stone.]
;B[qf];W[rf];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[qg];B[pf]C[Zakalwe : very bad shape. P14 or Q13 would be better]
;W[pg];B[of];W[id];B[md]C[i had this feeling that white could have attacked my black 25, but even so white got strong at the right side.

Zakalwe: you're right, but N16 is a little bit heavy. L15 would be better.
Notice that white has no territory on the upper side since you can jump at H18.]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[be];B[ch];W[ff];B[ib]C[i play inside the white group because i thought that i could take him at the center.]
;W[gb];B[bm];W[bo];B[lo]C[Zakalwe: this move seems aimless. Instead, let attack white with Q7, or build a moyo with P6 ...]
;W[ke]
(;B[ho]C[Zakalwe : if white encloses you at the top, he'll get a very good result. You have to escape to the center, at least to ensure that white won't take any point.]
;W[fm];B[ej];W[gj]
(;B[eh]C[Zakalwe: bad move. You are over concentrated ! Your group is alive, you'd better reduce white moyo. see variations]
;W[gh];B[mg]C[zakalwe: right :-)];W[kg];B[li];W[ki];B[lh];W[kh]

(;B[oi]C[Zakalwe : it's too timid. You can try Q10, or even R10.]
;W[pi];B[oh];W[ph]C[i believe i could win this game and that my position was solid, so i began to play conservetive.]

Zakalwe: you have played better yose than your opponent. I played in a calm and solid way. You should try to play lighter move. Playing light gives you more combinations, more flexibility. Thanks for have given me the opportunity to review this game.]
