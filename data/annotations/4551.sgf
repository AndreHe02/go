AB[pd][dp]C[om3. hi reviewer! in the middlegame this game became very confusing and i completely lost tactical overview. i tried to analyse it a little afterwards but im not sure if i did it right, so it would be cool if you could check these analysis!
certainly i would also be thankful for comments and suggestions on any other points in the game...]

(;W[bc]C[I would play as white J17, there are josekis using this move.]
;B[dc]
(;W[cf];B[ic]C[The cjoice of joseki is not very good for the handicap game. First, white ends gote, second black is nicely developed.]

(;W[dn]TR[gp][fq][gq]C[om3. i was very content with the outcome of the sequence in the lower left corner, because i thought i should definitely be able to gain profit by attacking these three triangled stones.... but how can one do this best?

In order to attack these stones, you have to get sente.];B[gn]

;W[mp];B[fm];W[gm];B[hm]
(;W[gl];B[fo];W[en];B[go];W[eo];B[hl]C[om3. am i right, that the white corner could simply be killed by playing b2 all the time??]

(;W[gk];B[dh]C[om3. how to deal with this invasion? should i have played differently before to prevent it?

Now you miss b18 move. With that move there is aji on];W[ef]

(;W[gg];B[gh];W[hh];B[hi];W[ii]C[om3. here i think, b could have done much better than he did.]

;W[mm];B[mn]C[om3. now, where the b group definitely has escaped i desperately tried to make any big catch... but what about a quiet continuation... considering that b2 still works...?!?

b2 was all the time very big - about 30 points.]

;W[ci];B[fl]C[om3. i think the game is now clearly lost and one can forget about the rest.... thank you very much for taking your time for this review! looking forward to read it.

game over! you have not used many possibilities.];W[em];B[ig]

i felt (but my counting is very bad...), that this would not be enough here....]
