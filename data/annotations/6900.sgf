Hope it helps!

;B[pj];W[kc];B[oc]C[laurents [2k\]: here, i wanted to complete a shimari since the extension at Q10 was already there.
laurents [2k\]: P17 looked kinda sente, since if White let me play J17, his position would be very thin.
laurents [2k\]: and so, he did respond];W[hc]
(;B[jq]C[[Frank\] I think either is ok.

laurents [2k\]: i thought about F17, but then thought it was too slow. so I decided on K3. I hesitated between k3 and D10/D11. I didn't do that becuase i was afraid of a White san rei sei]
;W[lq]
(;B[fq];W[er]
(;B[eq]C[[Frank\] I do not like E3 here.  It removes some of the corner aji you might have and C6 kakari becomes less effective.  When you played K3, you should have been ready for a response like M3-E2.  If you do not like E2, perhaps you should play G3.

laurents [2k\]: Here, i must admit i didn't really know how to respond......in retrospect, i probably should have F2 so as not to strengthen W.
laurents [2k\]: what do you think?
laurents [2k\]: I also thought about sort of tenuki and play C6 or even C3!]
;W[dq];B[cn]C[[Frank\] You are absolutely correct.  This move shows your indecision.  That said, in this situation, you can switch over and emphasize the left side instead of trying to make magic with two groups.

laurents [2k\]: in the end, i play this sequence which shows i haven't really made a clear choice. Better to do C6 without E3?
laurents [2k\]: and here, instead of C6, maybe i should have F2 first.
laurents [2k\]: Your thoughts?];W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr]
(;W[co]C[[Frank\] W is very generous...  He needs to split B here.  Any splitting move is ok I think.]
;B[dn]
(;W[ql]TR[cf]C[[Frank\] Seems there is bigger in this fuseki for W.]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm];B[pr];W[or]
;B[qr];W[kr]C[[Frank\] Seems like a pointless move]
(;B[bo]C[[Frank\] Very small unless you believe you can kill]

(;W[go]C[[Frank\] Absolutely.  You should not have played B5 because he had F5.  It would have been better for you to take F5.  Remember the fundamentals of connecting yourself and disconnecting your opponent.  if you play F5, W is disconnected from the center and your groups are very strong.

laurents [2k\]: should n't G5 be at F5?];B[fo];W[bp];B[do];W[cp]
C[[Frank\] W helps you connect nicely.]
(;B[ep]C[[Frank\] You should always look for a better move.  How about D9 instead?]
;W[cf]C[laurents [2k\]: Here, i felt very happy about the corner sequences (both South corners); should I be?
laurents [2k\]: I didn't know how to answer: C12/D12 to extend from from wall, or be more conservative and play F17?
laurents [2k\]: I was afraid of a double pincer, sth like this (see var)]

(;B[fc];W[bd];B[cg]C[laurents [2k\]: and so i played F17.]
(;W[bg]C[[Frank\] C13 is dangerous, but luckily W does not know joseki :)

laurents [2k\]: C13  is a kinda pincer move (again, it shows i didn't really choose...) ; here i tought W would answer at C17;]

(;B[cc]LB[bc:A][ic:B]TR[fc][dd]C[[Frank\] W was too generous here.  The idea with this shape here is that A and B are miai.  Both can form a base quickly and if your opponent takes away one, you can have the other.  In this situation, only A is available

laurents [2k\]: so I treated C13 as kikashi and took  the sans san to get a base easily.]
;W[bc];B[bb];W[cd];B[dc];W[ch];B[dg];W[bi];B[po]C[[Frank\] Well, W still has A18, which is why that shape I mentioned earlier can be dangerous for B.  If the top is settled, I think the timing is ok... Separating the bottom is probably the largest point on the board right now.

laurents [2k\]: I felt after the game I had not been patient enough for this move.]

;B[ln];W[mo];B[mn];W[qf]C[[Frank\] Can W play away right now?  What of O2?]

(;B[qh];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[pf];W[qe];B[pe];W[rd];B[re];W[rf]
;B[rc];W[se];B[qc];W[gb]C[[Frank\] W leads by around 20 in territory, so it comes down to what you can make with that wall.  That said, W should focus on minimizing what might be middle territory as much as possible.

laurents [2k\]: at this point, I felt very confident in the game. I thought I was leading by a lot (even though White has more territory so far).]
;B[fb]C[[Frank\] I think this is fine.

laurents [2k\]: I thought about G15 instead of F18 after the game... any thoughts?]

(;W[mc]C[laurents [2k\]: now, i would play K16; good idea or not?]
;B[jc]C[laurents [2k\]: K17 was plain stupid.
laurents [2k\]: i don't know why i played that:)]

;W[io];B[gn];W[in];B[im];W[hn];B[hm]C[[Frank\] To answer your original question, I would say the main reason this game was so close was simply that you were impatient.  There were many times that you played moves simply because you did not want your opponent to develop at all.  (for example, C6 because you did not want your opponent to get a shimari, or F3 for the same reason)

laurents [2k\]: and here, we reach the crux of the matter; (the end of it anyway): with all my thickness, I had no group to attck: so I made territory....  How should I have done?]
