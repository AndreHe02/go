;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jc]C[i dont know what the experts say to this move. But i think more common moves  here
are Q10 and F17.  It is not an extension from Q16 stone because W can easely invade around N16 and split  your groups. But K17 is no doubt a big point, so it may be ok.]
;W[nq]
(;B[oq]LB[pn:A][lq:B]C[Hm, i think  p3 is better when you have already a stone around K3 in place. Here you only
strengthen w by forcing him to play O4.  And W can still invade the corner at R3
remember that contact moves have the tendency to strenthen both sides.
Better play extension at A or pincer at B.
i have given some possible variations for A and B];W[np];B[gc]

(;B[cq]C[quite bad i think.
usually it is good to leave a fight and take sente elsewhere when there are bigger points
but here w has too many opportunities in the upper right.  Also here w has enclosed you in in the lower right. Your invasion on 3-3 point will give
W a second wall and makes lower part of board very big for him.
When invading on 3-3 point always try to look at the overall situation because you will
often be enclosed in the corner.

At least c3 makes game very complicated.

(;B[dq]MA[pd][qd]C[Hm, gives away the marked stones. W upper right  gets huge
R14 is still ok for black i think as it saves your R16 group and saves territory on the  right side]

[pe][pn][po][nq][np][op]TR[gc][jc][nc][nb][qj]C[ok you are living now in two corners and have good position in the upper side.
W has left side, upper right corner and huge walls facing the center.
When you look at the marked stones then you see that W is about to enclose a very big center mojo. It it time to fight for the center now. Your next move goes in the wrong direction.

It is hard for me  as 17k player to say what is best play for B is.]

(;B[cc]C[ouch! this gives w  another wall in exchange for a few points in the corner. After
this it is very difficult to get something in the center with all the w walls around.]
