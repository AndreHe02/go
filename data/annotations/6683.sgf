C[Dear rewiewer. I am Marek, I play black and lost that game definitly at about move 72.  What misteaks lead me to that result? What should I change to improve my games?

[krinid\]
Hello.  I am krinid, and I have reviewed one of your games before.  I'll take a look to see what mistakes you made.

The biggest mistake was letting white build up too strong a moyo.  Even by move 50, one can see white's huge, strong moyo, which has influence up to the top side.  You need to prevent your opponent from building up a moyo like that.  White got ahead very quickly, and it was mostly black trying to catch up the whole game.  While white was quite good at both making a moyo and also placing some key stones to break up black's groups, black was content trying to simply make unobtrusive territory without attacking white until black was behind.

There were chances for a comeback where white made mistakes (missing the connection of the top group to the center, the potential that the top group would thereafter die), but black didn't take advantage of them and also made mistakes as well (letting the white group live in the top right).]

[krinid\]
This is too small.  You need to address the potential huge moyo white is making on the bottom half of the board.  You need to break up his groups similar to what white has done to black with k16.

It's too early to say what's best, but I've added a few possibilities.]
;W[ok];B[qm];W[on]
(;B[oi];W[mj]C[[krinid\]
This hurts.  White is sealing off a large moyo in the bottom half here in exchange for a much smaller black moyo in the Q14 area.]

(;B[dl]C[[krinid\]
This is good, but overdue.  A venture into white's moyo.  

However, white so much white already present, white doesn't even have to kill the black group, but just create a wall up the G, H or J columns forcing black to live on the left side or connect to the upper left, and then white can extend the influence up to the top middle and top side to gain back what was lost from the d8 invasion.  Of course, killing the black invasion is also an excellent play, but more risky.]

You let too many opportunities go unused.  It's time to push into white's territory at all borders to reduce as much as possible.  There's a lot of reduction that can occur.  White was kind enough to let the H13 group, so push out and reduce from it.  I think it still requires some mistakes on white's part to win, but the difference in territory can be reduced to make a closer match.]

Now you're forced to connect to another group the the d15 or r16 area, because your j5 group can't live there.  White has a lot to gain by making you run up the board to connect or forcing you to make a group with eyes that takes very little territory but strengthens white's walls greatly.
