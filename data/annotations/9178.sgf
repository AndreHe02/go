C[It was fun to review this game.
It was a perfect example mojo against territory.

I prefix my comments with g4:
I hope you enjoy it.

;B[qc];W[oc];B[qb];W[jc];B[cn]C[Leo: Maybe I missed to play around R10? Think this would have been the Joseki move.
g4: It's a matter of taste. Nothing wrong with C6. If you don't play on the left side, white can play perfectly at C10, which is also good looking.]
;W[dj]C[g4: With C6 already in place black has now better options.]
;B[cq]C[g4: Possible, but this gives white a perfect mojo. Play this only, if you are confident to handle this mojo. I'd like to play E6 instead.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[fp]C[Leo: This is good result for White, isn't it? Did I choose the wrong direction for my approach move? Would F3 have been a better choice?
g4: If you really don't want to play against a mojo, you should consider playing C10 instead of an approach move. But C6 in itsself seems OK to me.]
;B[gq]C[Leo: Anyway I decided that making secure territory on the 3rd line isn't too bad, is it?
g4: This is correct. There are many invasion and reduction points in white's sphere of influence. But it may become more difficult to decide the right way.]
;W[pj]
(;B[qi]C[g4: Perhaps I wouldn't have resonded to Q10. I'd prefer G4, expanding yout influence and reducing his.]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[oj];B[ql];W[jj]C[Leo: Now White has a splendid mojo and Black has quite secure territory. Is the game still even?
g4: Very difficult question. In my opinion, yes it is still even. But playing against a mojo is a difficult task. I'd add some possibilities here of how to handle this perhaps.]

(;B[cf]C[Leo: Is this a good point to start an invasion? My next choice would have been C16 (although I'm not that used to this attachment).
g4: There is enough room to live. This should be OK.];W[df]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[ci]C[g4: I you want to play here now, I would try C10. Attaching makes both sides stronger. You will need. And this reaches out to C6 which is annoying for white.]
;W[cj];B[bi]C[Leo: Too heavy - should I better try to move out?
g4: Definitely yes. Moving out is a must.];W[bj];B[ei]C[g4: OK Nothing happened.]
;W[ej];B[gh];W[di];B[dh];W[fi];B[bd]C[g4: I would play F12 and fight the ko. If you play against a mojo, you have always plent of ko threats.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[cg];B[bf];W[eh]C[g4: Good sequence by white.]
;B[ch];W[eg];B[dc]C[Leo: Is this too much? Should Black just make his group alive playing B13? The way I played this ended in gote which made White place the 'last' stone O13 to almost turn his mojo into territory.
g4: I don't think this group can be killed now. You have to defend if there is a white stone at B17. The corner is surely big. But I think all moves which enter the mojo are somewhat like sente and should be played first. For example N14, K12, N12, H5 or even L17.]
;W[ec];B[cc]C[Leo: Stretching to D18 would have been sente (and a much better move), wouldn't it? Think I was afraid of some kind of tesuji here.
g4: Reading is always difficult. D18 seems better here.];W[eb]
;B[db]C[g4: This is worth nearly nothing. Enter the mojo instead.]
;W[ng]C[g4: Good point. Now it's very tough.];B[nh];W[mh];B[ni]
;W[og];B[pg];W[li];B[nj]C[g4: How about N11, preparing for N9?]
;W[ol];B[mk]C[g4: Black is strong here. Should be at N8.];W[pm]
;B[qm];W[mm];B[ml];W[pn];B[qn];W[np];B[po]C[g4: Avoid moves which solidifies the attacking target. Something like L7 comes to my mind.]
;W[oo];B[op]C[g4: You are helping white to get two eyes.];W[no]
C[Leo: I think attacking the weak White group in the right center was strategically okay. Anyway I was not able to get much territory in the lower right. What went wrong? Was N8 too lame?
g4: I hope my ideas have answered this.];B[nm]C[g4: This is gote. Playing in the inside ist mostly only good, if you can kill. Better M7.]
;W[mn]C[g4: Should be at N6 to gain sente.];B[nl];W[om]C[g4: Not too bad fpr black now.]
;B[lp]C[g4: I would rather like to block white's way to his friendly stones. Perhaps K7?]
;W[nq]C[g4: ? K7 or K6 and the game is nearly over.]
(;B[lr]C[g4: I had tried L6. White can make only one eye at the bottom.]
;W[lo];B[kl]C[g4: I'd like to block anyway. If K7 is enough I don't know.]
;W[kp];B[kq];W[mr]C[g4: Still only one eye.];B[jp]C[g4: very good.]
;W[ko]
(;B[il]C[g4: Why not K5?];W[jo];B[ip];W[jm];B[jl];W[hn];B[gl]
;W[hk];B[hl]C[g4: If you answer like this you can't coonect to G12. I had tried G5 to attack the B5 group.]
;W[hp]
(;B[hq]C[g4: J5 instead. You can only play this way, if you are confident of winning. Did you count as good? Bt the fighing is also tough.]
;W[ho];B[fn];W[fo];B[nn]C[g4: Makes the ko smaller. You should avoid this move.]
;W[on]C[Leo: This exchange didn't help Black. Just removed one Ko thread.]
;B[in]C[Leo: Most definitely was a mistake. Here I missed the chance to connect to C6 and lost a significant amount of points on the left side.
g4: yes];W[io];B[im];W[en];B[el];W[dl];B[ne];W[me];B[od];W[nc]

;B[ok]C[Leo: I think White just did not see this Ko. Or was he aware that there aren't any big threads? I found it several moves before and therefore could have chosen a better timing or preparation if there would have been a chance?
g4: If you hadn't played O6, the ko would be too big for white.]

C[g4: Just Q15 is right here. But maybe too small. A5, G4, D6, E19or even K18 seem bigger.]
;W[of];B[pe];W[mf];B[ok];W[ai];B[nk]C[g4: Why? Giving 5 for 5? Justtake at B13.]
;W[bh]C[Leo: During the match I though taking the Ko won me some points. Now I'm not that sure anymore. E.g. G4, D6, E19  would have been other possible Ko thread.
g4: Yes of course. You made some 4 or 6 points here.];B[ea]

Leo: Finally I made some mistakesin the end game (e.g. not playing D15) and lost by 3.5 points. What were the most severe defects in my game? I marked some situations where I (now) think I made a mistake. Probably you also found others.

Thanks again for taking the time to review my game!

g4: I hope my ideas helped a little.
It was a good game which I liked to review.])
