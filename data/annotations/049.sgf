;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dq];B[co];W[fp];B[cl];W[ed]C[I don't know joseki that well but "b"  seems better if black wants to play down left side.  There's probably a  joseki involving "a" but i don't know it.]

(;B[de];W[ee]M[pd]C[Black 11 is a strange move for a couple of reasons.  First, the UL is  unsettled.  While this is true for both sides, it probably favors w if a  fight breaks out because w is probably stronger player.  Black moves at
 "b" or "c" seem best to settle UL (or at least make w answer on upper  side).  Second, the marked stone on 4-4 point calls for big extensions,  something like "d" is appropriate.  Black 11 is not far enough to be big  extension but too far to be corner pr
otection.  All in all, probably best to settle corner 1st.]
(;B[lc]C[Since b didn't settle corner, probably best for white to do it.]

;B[lj]C[If white wants to defend then I'd pick "b" which threatens  invasions into black territory.]

C[All in all, this has not been a good sequence for  black.  White has extended his influence and made right side moyo very large  while black is left with weak stones and
 some extra territory on the bottom edge.   If black wants to use the triangled stone, better to force white to capture  with "b" rather than "a".   Diamond marked stones are very weak but at least  ladder does not work on capturing them.]

(;B[km];W[ln];B[im];W[kr]C[With this move, white is very  happy.  Capture enemy stones and ties his groups together.  Black stones on  k-line have chance to live but white has gotten solid territory.]

;B[fi];W[gm];B[gh];W[fg]M[gm][im][km][lm][jn][jo]C[White's triangled stone  goes a long way toward reducing potential b
lack moyo on left side.  Additionally, it puts subtle pressure on marked  black stones.  White may not be able to actually capture them but it will  cost black to have to defend them.   91 is probably a big move for black but i think a move like "b" is bigger  because it protects k-line stones and builds moyo.]

(;B[cq];W[cr];B[bq];W[jl]C[There's a saying in go--"Even an  idiot connects against a peep."  By letting white cut, black is separated  into *at least* two weak groups while white has only one to worry about.   The sequences leading from "b" are a bit fanciful but it would seem hard for  white to capture k-line stones if black just connects.]

(;B[hl];W[jm];B[in];W[hn];B[ll];W[il];B[hm];W[hj]C[Cutting at 103 really serves no  purpose for black.  Better to keep running with "b".  Even if white somehow  manages to live  with marked stones, it will be small life.]

(;B[gn]C[Ignore "b"  here.]
(;W[gl];B[ho];W[hk];B[ip];W[jq];B[ik];W[io];B[ph]C[111 is a pretty  big ko threat but w chooses to ignore it.  This is a tough call but probably  correct given that the fighting
 has gotten this complex.  White *should* take a big hit in his right side  moyo after this.]
;W[hn]C[Why capture with 113????  It makes no  sense!  "b" is a much better move.  Threatens marked stones and captures  stones on right side just the sa
me.  In addtion, it gives black the reduction of white's right side that he  needs as compensation for disaster in center--even so, it probably won't be  enough.  Game is pretty much over at this point.]
