AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[tannguyen> Please spot my bad move and good move and thank you.

Anton> Hi Tan, I will do my best to review this game and give you some useful pointers. Please forgive me if some comments seem too direct to you - I only wish to help you improve in the wonderful game of Go.

The main things that you need to pay attention to are the following:
1. Try to think about the meaning of opponent's moves before reacting to them - in many cases in this game you responded to moves that weren't a threat at all.
2. Try to think about the value of your moves before making them - I will show you some simple cases where you spent a move to get one or two points - while you could get 10-20 instead.
3. You are very protective of your groups - it may help you to try risking a little more. At least, before making another move to protect your group think again to check if it isn't already protected well enough.
4. Make sure to attack your opponent, don't let his plans come to fruition too easily.

Please pay attention to your end game - in this phase the moves are the simplest, and very easy to calculate what you gain and what you lose - yet you made a lot of wasteful moves, which shows that you need to practice thinking ahead even in the most simple situations. You will immediately become much stronger if you train a habit to think ahead - as far as you can (even if it doesn't seem too far at first).

There are more things to learn, of course, but even the above will help you improve a lot, I think.

Good luck!];W[nc];B[jq]C[Anton> This move serves only to claim some influence - which is a good goal. But it could serve two goals at once - to claim and to attack. As you can see, there is a symmetry between the bottom point (K3) and the top point (K17) with the only exception - below there is no white stone. If you played K17 (or L17, which you did later) - you would get some influence, but would also threaten the white stone at O17 - which would give you the initiative in the further fight.]
;W[qn]C[Anton> White misses the chance to claim more of the upper side.]
;B[kc]C[Anton> Well done, though white could have used their previous move to expand on this side instead - then it would be more difficult.]
;W[qc];B[rd]C[Anton> Here you seem to try to protect the territory on the right side - but there is no territory there yet (as you can see by the way this game developed). While doing this - you allow white to connect their two stones, and get a lot of the corner.

Response here should be more aggressive - Q17, to divide the white's stones, and attack both of them. Getting a corner should not be that easy for him.

Also, even if you wanted to protect the territory - S16 is too low for that (especially this early in the game), and leave a huge hole - and a very weak wall, that could easily be attacked and exploited by white.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]C[Anton> Here white could use the weakness of black's wall, and play much more aggressively - at P16. This would tear black's position to pieces.]
;B[od];W[fc];B[gd]C[Anton> I would play H17 instead - both make a good base for the black stone at L17, and attack the white stone at F17.

G16 is too loose - it seems to be directed at central influence, but leaves too many holes for white to get through.]
;W[cc];B[ec]C[Anton> The idea is good - you need to separate the white stones (what you failed to do in the upper right corner). The execution is not good - E17 forms a bad shape with the other black stones, and thus allows the white stones to attack it - and connect.

A simple and strong move at D17 would be much better, reliably separating the two white stones.]
;W[eb];B[fd];W[gb];B[gc];W[fb];B[dc]C[Anton> If the goal here was to build a wall facing the lower side (which is a good goal) - it would be better to just play C16. D17 is 
a) a bad shape (empty triangle), 
b) a small move - it does threaten to separate white stones, but it doesn't - and only forces white to make an obvious response, stealing one point. One point is very little at this stage.

Though in this area I would prefer to play H18, so that this black group is better connected to the black stone at L17. Also, this time could be used to attack the white stone at R6, if you want to be more aggressive, or claim more influence - K10 is a good example.]
;W[db];B[cb]C[Anton> This move seems to have no meaning. White could ignore and extend to C16, getting more and more territory in this corner.]
;W[bb];B[cd];W[ca];B[bc]C[Anton> This move it too small at this stage. Try looking for more important moves on the board - ones that would get you more influence (some simple examples are N15, K10) and / or attack the white groups (for example R5, R8).]
;W[cb];B[po]C[Anton> This move is very slow and weak - it does not do much for black, and does not look scary for white.

If you wish to push white out of the corner - make an attachment at R5. If you wish to safely close the corner - descend to R4. If you want to try to enclose white in the corner, and get the outside influence - approach from R8. Note that each of these moves stops white from building a base in one direction - thus forcing him to build in the other, or jump out to the centre. The move at Q5 does not really stop white from choosing what he wants to do.]
;W[qk];B[qm]C[Anton> I like this move, it is very brave, and obviously takes initiative by scaring white into panic decisions.]
;W[rm];B[rn]C[Anton> Well done, aggressive cutting supports the bravery of the earlier move.]
;W[pm];B[ql];W[rl];B[pl];W[sn];B[ro];W[pk];B[ol];W[ok];B[om]
C[Anton> I think here there is no direct threat to the black group beneath the white wall, so this would be a good chance to strengthen the stone at Q10 a little - perhaps by playing around R12.

Be careful about spending your move to make your already strong groups stronger - a move that could be spent on helping the weak stones instead.]
;W[nl];B[pn]C[Anton> The white stone at Q7 was caught already, it would be better to expan your influence further along the lower side, by playing at O7 - this would also theaten to cut white at O9 later.]
;W[oh];B[oi]C[Anton> Because of the hole at R16, it would be safer to try and connect Q10 with the group at Q16, instead of cutting through. R12 still seems like a good move that.]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[qi];B[ph];W[qh];B[og];W[nh];B[pg];W[kh];B[mh]
C[Anton> Pushing through at O11 is a stronger move, which would cause white to react protectively.]
;W[mi];B[mg]C[Anton> When you see a possibility to cut - seriously consider it. In this case O11 would be a very good cut, forcing white to run away.]
;W[ni];B[ng]C[Anton> Connecting your stones is good, but in this case neither of the groups are in direct danger, so you could spend this move elsewhere - for example N9 is a good attacking point.

Though, it is still very good to keep your groups connected, so I can't say it is a bad move :)]
;W[lh];B[li]C[Anton> Nice cut.];W[lj];B[ki];W[kj];B[ji];W[jj]
;B[jh];W[mn];B[mm];W[nm];B[nn];W[ml];B[lm];W[ll];B[ln];W[km]
;B[mo]C[Anton> Up to this point this sequence is well played! Here it was not necessary to capture the white stone at N6 - you could continue along the bottom side by playing at L6, to prevent white from getting there at all - then the territory at the bottom side would become more and more solid.

Also note that this move forms and empty triangle (because of white stone at O7), so this weak shape could be used later to white's advantage.]
;W[kn]C[Anton> White uses the chance to wrap around the black group.]
;B[lo]C[Anton> M5 is not justified - it submits to white before white even did anything. In such cases try to stretch out, instead of overcrowding your stones. L5 is much better.]
;W[jo]C[Anton> Very slow move by white.];B[ko]C[Anton> This stone could be played earlier, with the same result - now you can see that M5 was a useless move. Try to use your stone's potential to the fullest (even and especially if you are going to lose them :)).

A better reaction to white's move at K5 is to prepare for white's invading the left part of the bottom side - by playing at F4 (then the future white invasion at H3 could be used to gain influence on the left side of the board), for example.]
;W[jn]C[Anton> Another slow move by white. It may be that white relaxed after seeing some of your moves - if you see in your games that this is the case, then it is high time to become very aggressive and unpredictable, to turn the table around :)]
;B[kg]C[Anton> Okay, you see no direct threat at the bottom anymore and decide to take initiative elsewhere. This is good thinking in general - you shouldn't always follow your opponent's moves, you need to decide where to play every time.

Though in this case I would rather play F4, to prepare for future fight in this area. Capturing the two white stones is not so urgent at the moment.

If you do need to capture them, though, check possibility of a move like K13 or K14 - it still captures the stones, but gets your stones in a better position, less crowded and reaching out further.]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[Anton> Good, you need to build influence towards the left side.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[bp];B[ep]C[Anton> B5 is better, to prevent white from sliding under your stones, and to emphasize the left side.]
;W[bo]C[Anton> White knows what he wants in this case - destroy black's influence.]
;B[dr]C[Anton> Very small move - there is no risk of white jumping under your stones to the middle of the lower side - and the lower side is not so interesting because of the white stones at K5 reducing black's influence.

Better would be to stop white's invasion to the left side before it is too late - by playing at C7, for instance.]
;W[cr];B[er]C[Anton> Very small for this stage of the game. Think about what would happen if you left this stone unprotected - white plays E2, you play F2, and white has to capture at D1 (otherwise E2 would be a wasted move and stone) - while you don't need to respond at all. If this happens it will cost you 4 points - but check out the board, and see if you can find moves with higher cost - C7 is still a good opportunity to stop the white stones. Another option is J10 (nice because of the strong black wall at G16).]
;W[cm]C[Anton> It would be good to have a black stone here instead :)]
;B[cn]C[Anton> This move does not seem to achieve anything - white can still connect easily and, while attacking this black stone (and the subsequent moves) gets even stronger.

Better to play simply and just stop white from getting further - around C9, for example.]
;W[bn];B[dm];W[co];B[dn];W[do];B[eo];W[fj];B[dl]C[Anton> White tries to reduce black's framework in the upper part of the left side - a logical reaction would be to protect it. You could play E12 for a passive protection, or J10 for active protection (threatening to surround the white stone at F10).]
;W[cl];B[dk]C[Anton> Too tight. C9 connects the black stones and slows white's invasion at the same time.]
;W[fk]C[Anton> Hm, very slow for a stone that needs to invade.]
;B[fl]C[Anton> One stone further would be stonger - G8, it both protects from the cut at E6, and invades what white seems to want to make his territory.]
;W[gl];B[gk];W[fm];B[el];W[hk];B[gj];W[gi];B[gm]C[Anton> You gave up the cutting stones at G9 too easily - this is not a good idea, cutting stones are very valuable.]
;W[hj];B[fn]C[Anton> Think about playing a less crowded and a more "reaching out" move at H7.]
;W[hm]C[Anton> This didn't need to happen.];B[em]C[Anton> ...but if it does happen - don't leave weak spots behind. Now white can move further down - G6 or H6. You could play G6 instead of capturing the white stone, and prevent white from moving down too easily.]
;W[qq];B[qo]C[Anton> There was no need to capture this stone yet - white needed to make at least one more move (at R4) before connecting. Best to attack the lone white stone at Q2 - while it is still very weak.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[nq];B[op];W[mr];B[np]C[Anton> Very small - if you don't play O4, white could play it, and only get one additional point.

You could regain control of the corner instead - black Q2, white forced O1, black R2 - white's two stones have less liberties than black's, and have no way to outrun black.]
;W[ns];B[mq]C[Anton> Too small. Having lost this corner, check the other areas of the board, to see if you could gain more by taking initiative elsewhere.

Examples - E12, H18, H4.];W[nr];B[mp]C[Anton> Sorry, but this is a useless move. This area of the board can be left as is for a while, but even here M3 is better - it gets additional territory, while N4 takes at least one point of your territory away.]
;W[ci];B[cj]C[Anton> If you plan to separate and capture the white stone (which you should be able to) better play at C9, to get more territory in the process.]
;W[bj];B[bi]C[Anton> B9 would separate the white stones more reliably instead of sacrificing a stone at B11 (which gives white a free eye).]
;W[bh];B[di]C[Anton> You need to separate the white groups - B9 is the only move for this now.]
;W[ai];B[ch]C[Anton> Playing atari every time that you get a chance is not a good habit - try to stop yourself in such cases and think carefully about what you achieve and what you lose.

In this case you only make white stronger, and build an unreliable wall (a cutting point at D12) yourself.]
;W[bi];B[ck]C[Anton> A one point move - too small.];W[bk];B[dh]
C[Anton> C13 would achieve more by keeping white stones on the second line.]
;W[fg];B[fh]C[Anton> There is little to be gained for black by playing in this crowded area, but there are still good moves elsewhere - for example H18, H4 or R13.]
;W[gh];B[eh];W[ig];B[gg];W[gf];B[hg];W[hf];B[ff];W[hh];B[fe]
;W[jb];B[jc]C[Anton> No need to build an outside wall in this case (because of presence of white stones around J13, breaking any black influence), consider L18 and then N18 instead.]
;W[ic];B[id];W[hc];B[hd];W[ib]C[Anton> An unnecessary move by white.]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[nd];W[nb];B[lc];W[lb];B[md]C[Anton> The connection was already reliable, no need to spend another move here. You could play K14 instead, to preserve the territory that you have here.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[eg];B[ef]C[Anton> In such cases D14 stops your opponent better (with some exceptions when this would produce weak connection - but not in this case).]
;W[dg];B[cg]
(;W[bg];B[cf]C[Anton> B14 would be more efficient in stopping white.]
;W[gn]C[Anton> This is what we discussed earlier - leaving weak shapes allows your opponent to exploit them and gain advantage later.]
;B[fm];W[go];B[fo]C[Anton> This move was not needed, white is not threatening to cut. You could play H3 instead, to protect your territory.]
;W[gp];B[df]C[Anton> A half-point move - if white decided to push through at D14, you would respond at D15, and white would have to protect their stones - thus giving you the initiative. Such points are best left until the very end.]
;W[gg];B[bd]C[Anton> Still too small (though soon this would be a good move) - check R13 or H3 instead.]
;W[ip];B[kq];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[jr];W[is];B[kp]C[Anton> Unnecessary move.]
;W[rc];B[re];W[rf];B[sf];W[sg];B[se];W[qg];B[qf];W[rg];B[pf]
C[Anton> Unnecessary move.];W[fq];B[fr];W[gr];B[tt]
(;W[lf];B[lg]C[Anton> You could play L14 instead, punish white for being too risky.]
;W[kf];B[jg]C[Anton> K14 would separate white stones. K13 has no meaning - does not gain you anything, and does not hurt white in any way.]
;W[jf];B[jd]C[Anton> Unnecessary move.];W[be];B[ce]C[Anton> Consider playing B14 first (threaten to separate), and only then C15 (threaten to capture) - and gain the initiative.]
;W[bf];B[tt];W[ie];B[je]C[Anton> N15 gains you more.];W[he]
;B[so];W[rk];B[sm];W[sl];B[sn]C[Anton> Closing such half-point kos should be left till the end. You could jump under the white stones (to S2, for example) instead.]
;W[mf];B[qj];W[rj];B[nf];W[rp];B[tt];W[me];B[le]C[Anton> Unnecessary move.]
;W[ne];B[oe];W[ke];B[kd]
(;W[if];B[tt];W[ii];B[sc];W[sb];B[rb];W[sd];B[ra];W[pb];B[sc]
;W[ls];B[sa];W[lq];B[kr];W[lr];B[js]C[Anton> Unnecessary move (check A18, C1, T4, R19 instead).]
;W[hs];B[fs]C[Anton> Unnecessary move - white can play D1 and steal the point. C1 is better as it reduces white territory.]
;W[qa];B[sb];W[ac];B[ad];W[ab];B[ds];W[cs];B[gs]C[Anton> Unnecessary move.]
;W[fp];B[hp];W[ho];B[qp];W[rq];B[kb];W[ka];B[ae];W[af];B[jp]
