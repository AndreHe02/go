C[Hi, I play white in this game, which I played on kgs.  I ruined the first big joseki, and played behind most of the game, but I'm hoping you can offer some advice.   I have a few comments at different points along the game.

Thanks,
Tom

I will mark my comments with [ZD\].];B[pp];W[pd];B[dc];W[dp]
;B[ce];W[dj]LB[jd:A]C[[ZD\] Wrong direction.  A would be more normal, as this is the point where black wants to develop.]
;B[nc];W[qg];B[jd];W[qn]LB[nq:A]C[[ZD\] A would seem better to me, as lower left has better potential.]

(;B[pn];W[pm];B[om]LB[pl:B][qm:C][on:D][po:A]C[At this point I couldn't decide what to do.  A move like R8 would have easily kept my stones together, but I thought I could get more by working the aji at Q5.

[ZD\] A and B are joseki moves.  C seems possible, but the cut at D is then less severe.]
;W[po];B[on];W[qp];B[oo]C[Here I think I should have played R5.

[ZD\] Definitely.]
(;W[pq];B[qo]C[At this point I thought maybe I could live in the corner and still have a group on the outside.  I was probably fooling myself.]

(;W[rq];B[oq]LB[ro:A]C[[ZD\] Possible; A is another choice.]
;W[qm]LB[ro:A][oq:B]C[[ZD\] If you wanted to continue here, you had to play A; by not doing it, you are giving black both good continuations in this area (A and B).  Furhtermore, after black plays A, you will have problems with living in the corner.]
;B[ro]
(;W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[rp]C[[ZD\] At this point, it must have been clear to you that this group is dead, so you should have stopped playing here.]
;W[qq];B[sq];W[sr];B[qs];W[pj]LB[sl:A][qm:C][fq:B]C[[ZD\] While this move looks nice, it does not give you much due to black's jump to A.  I would at least consider B.  However, since your move saves C, it seems correct.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[hq]LB[hc:C][cg:B][cn:A]C[I felt like I needed to reduce the power of black's wall.  Was this the biggest play?

[ZD\] I would have considered playing pincer instead of A, before.  This invasion does not seem really good to me.  A simple solution for black is in the variation (he builds up his moyo, and takes corner territory); but other plays are possible for him, too.  B and C are probably bigger than this invasion.]

(;B[hp];W[ip];B[iq];W[gp];B[io];W[gq];B[go];W[fp];B[ne];W[gd]
LB[hc:A][jc:C][gd:B]TR[nc][jd][ne]C[I think I needed an invasion to win.

[ZD\] A would be a better point to invade, as it gives you an option to live on the upper side; this way, you will have to run.

Let's count whether you need to invade:  You have some 25 pts in lower left, and about 10 pts on right side, for total of  35 points.  Black will for sure have at least 30 points in lower right, and about 10 points in upper left, so he is some 5 points ahead (plus he has much stronger positions and more potential).

It indeed seems that invasion is necessary.  However, both A and B seem too conservative -- black can play simply and strengthen the triangled stones, making territory in progress; since your invasion probably will not gain any territory, you will get worse of it than you were before.  I guess playing something very active and fighting (like C) is the only chance at this moment.]
;B[gf];W[dg]LB[ef:A][cg:C][dg:B]C[[ZD\] B was strange; you play an invasion, then play a move that clearly sacrifices it?  Black should just answer at A.

If you wanted to play here, C would be better, as it actually protects the territory on side.]
;B[cl]LB[ek:A]C[How should I deal with black's invasion?

[ZD\] A seems like the best option; it will be somewhat difficult for black to run away.]
;W[dl];B[cm];W[dm]
(;B[dn];W[co];B[cj];W[di]LB[ci:A]C[[ZD\] Hane at A would be better.]
;B[bh]LB[bi:A]C[[ZD\] This seems like a mistake from black, due to the variations.  A would be the proper move here.]

(;W[bj];B[dh];W[ck];B[ch]LB[dg:A]C[It seems this sequence is bad for white, especially since my stone on top has little help now.

[ZD\] If you wanted to do something with your stone on top, you should have never played  A.]

[ZD\] You should have never allowed A, in the first place.  I would now play B, but as you say, the game is lost anyway.]
