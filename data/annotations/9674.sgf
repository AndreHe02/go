AB[dd][pp]C[Eisenhorn: Although I won, I felt most of the time being chased and under pressure.

Hi My name is Michael, I'll be doing an overview of your game. I can't comment much on openings, but I'll be sure to talk a bit about middle and end game :). Thanks for letting me do this review.]
;W[dp];B[pd];W[jc];B[qj];W[nc];B[nd]C[Eisenhorn: Wrong choice?

I can't really comment on this. This isn't necessarily bad, especially with your stone at S10, you'll be expecting some good territory in the corner and good moyo on the side.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[od]C[This move is unusual, not joseki. I think this reduces the liberties of the white group, which creates a pretty severe cut at N17 for black.]
;B[oe];W[pe]C[Overplay by white see the variation.]
(;B[rd]C[Eisenhorn:  is Q18 better? Yea I think Q18 is better to punish white. You're letting white separate your black groups - but the problem is that white shouldn't be able to and you should punish this overplay.]

(;B[lf]C[This move is slow, consider a 1 space jump. See variation.]
;W[ke]C[So as commentary on opening, I would prefer a move around K3 or K4. Just to develop framework quicker. There is nothing wrong with R7, but if white approaches K3, it looks too good for him.]
;B[qm]
(;W[mh];B[mg];W[pf];B[rh]C[This is more of an endgame move. You are claiming about 10 pts in gote.]
;W[nf];B[se]C[This is an end game move, worth about 2.5 pts. There are many more unedeveloped parts of the board. This is YOUR sente! use it!]
;W[li];B[kh]C[This is where we start to think, hey that one space jump at K14 might be better than M14.]
;W[ki];B[ih];W[jh];B[jg];W[ji];B[kf];W[ig];B[if];W[hg];B[je]
C[The past 4 moves have been painful for black, because he has been forced to make this concentrated shape. Notice white's shape in the middle? It's solid, alive, and exudes influence intot he center. Black is left with a small concentrated group. This is where that jump at K14 would have really prevented that situation.]
;W[kd];B[cn]C[Black can't afford this right now, his black group is about to die. He only has one eye at L13. K14 is a false eye! If black gets enclosed, the game is surely over.]

C[Good!];W[hi]C[This is too slow for white. He was not really in that much danger of losing his 3 white stones.]
;B[mq];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[op];B[nq];W[rp]
C[ouch! you must block at the bottom for 2 reasons. 1 if he ends up creeping in your territory, that ends up being a huge loss. 2, if you respond, he HAS to respond to live in the corner! see the variation to see why your opponent must respond.

As for proverbs.
L group is dead, L+1 group is alive if sente, dead if gote, L+2 is always alive. See this page http://senseis.xmp.net/?LGroup.]

(;B[cp]C[I think it might be better to block the other way. Since if white splits this way, he has some nice territory. If you block the otherway you have infiltrated his territory and can potentially split his group.]

;B[tt]C[Overall it was a fun and interesting game :)

I think you have a great sense of the opening overall. No obvious blunders, and so I can tell a lot of thought has been put into each move. A couple things to improve your game. I would say white made some pretty big mistakes in the bottom left which left him with very little territory. You clinched the game with a big endgame monkey jump, great job!

--When escaping, consider the lighter shapes. The 1 space or 2 space extensions. These are faster and more flexible. Also if your tail gets captured, you won't lose an entire dragon. 

--When attacking your opponent's shapes consider keima, it can offer some advantages over a net.

--When you block your opponent's hane on the second line, you should ALSO block with hane, or else you've given your opponent a free lunch ;)]
