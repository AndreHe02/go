C[Hello dear Reviewer, I am between 7-9k on different servers and I was Black in this game.

I played this game on KAYA.gs a new GO server that is in development, at the moment in the Beta phase, so there is still a lot to do for the Admins.

Anyway, I played against Farful (8-9k and white in this game), one of the players I play more often against and also one of the players I choiced as my intern Oponnent to see how his game goes etc. as extra Motivation for me.
The game was free, as it was an ASR League game http://www.advancedstudyroom.com/ASR/ and the Time settings Farful choiced was 45 Minutes, I used a good deal of it, but resigned pretty "early" at move 107.

On Kaya.gs you can use a feature called malkovich (/ma yadayada) to write things that just the observers can read until the game is over, so your Oponnent and you can review it better/or you later etc. I included some of my Oponnents Malkovich with his permission so that it is maybe easier for you to review. I also included several comments myself ofc.

If you have time, it would be lovely if you could also make some comments about whites moves.

Myself, I would love to hear comments about fuseki, and ofc about my biggest mistakes. I felt like my oponnent got all he wanted, and the Territory on the right side, and I just got Influence that I couldn't use because he had no weak group.

After his invasion late in the game, I would love to hear how to react better, and if white could have choicen other moves or if the game was already lost for me, already before the invasion from him, because he just seemed to be ahead in Territory after he could fix his Left Corner, so the last hope for me was to invade sometime in his upper right corner? but that was prevented by his invasion, and my bad mistakes. Sorry for the Wall of text.

Greetings,

Oceandrop (Black in this Game 9k)];B[pd]C[Hi, My name is Gus. I'll try to prefix my comments with "Gus:" 

The basic problem that both of you have is creating second weak groups when you haven't secured the first one. Black was winning for most of the game, but missed a key cut at the end and then appears to have panicked made a bad move and then unreasonably continued throwing good stones after bad.

(;B[jd];W[cj]C[As white I don't like playing this move it seems a bit slow. B will get a double wing formation.]
(;B[jp]C[Gus: It's in the middle of a large side, but the other star point is slightly better since it gets all of your 

Oceandrop (Black):

I thought it was a nice move to contain white on one site and force white to split, where I have on both sites Starpoints, but maybe not good to let him split if he has nearly all his stones connected on the left side?]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[qn];B[ql]
(;W[rl]C[Gus: In this position if W plays the bottom he should get the top and if he plays the top he should get the bottom.

Oceandrop (Black):

I thought playing the next moves, would maybe give me a nice wall that will later work good together with my other high stones.]
(;B[qk];W[rk];B[pj];W[qm];B[rj];W[np]TR[rk][rl][qm][qn]C[This move is somewhat crazy. The marked group is still weak. when you see your opponent tenuki from a weak group and make a second group, try to find a way to play in the middle and attack both groups at once.

Oceandrop (Black):

I didn't expect the move, I thought about P5 too, but than I thought it would leave my stones too weak and would just hurt my K4 stone with trying to seperate his R6 and O4 stones, so I wanted to create a base first.]
;B[nq]C[This attacks the left (sort of)];W[mq]C[Gus: Every time you make a plan that has the word "somehow" in it you are gambling. Don't gamble. Read it. :).

Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: reason for o4 was to somehow link it up with r6 and build a wall around his lower right coner. who knows if that'll actually succeed...]
;B[oq]C[

Oceandrop (Black):

I actually hoped that he would attatch at P3, so I could drawback and give up corner for seperating his groups, but maybe my move at O3 wasn't so good anyway and it was good that he attatched at N3 for me.]
;W[pl];B[pk];W[lp]C[
Now attack the other one to make your corner solid. Even if the other one lives, you will be solid and only one of the two white groups will be solid. A weak group can't attack you k4 stone. 

Oceandrop (Black):

 I thought about P5 for splitting, but than again I think that would just hurt my own stones/my K4 stone, so maybe make a base with S3 or S4 I thought, or helping my single stone a bit with F3 maybe. I decided for S3 to solving one problem, and S3 because I was too afraid of R3, but maybe S4 would have been better for also threatening to take away the base for his R6 group?]
(;B[rq]C[Gus: This is a bit slack];W[qp];B[qq];W[po];B[op]C[Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: he has a cut at o5 :(
farful[9k\]: how detrimental will it be?];W[no];B[oo];W[on]
;B[fq]C[Gus: You should never consider double approach in this situation! Your two stones are WEAK. you can't start another weak group near by and expect both groups to live. Even if they do both live your opponent will get a BILLION useful forcing moves on the outside... :)

Oceandrop (Black) I played this move, in thought that if he connects at O6 I will play F5 or double approach, and if he doesn't connect, maybe I can cut later.]
(;W[dn];B[nn]C[Gus: W should not allow this cut. W is now loosing.]
(;W[rp]C[Gus: Again, Weak groups cannot attack. B is in no danger at all because both w groups are weak. 

Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: his q4 group may be in danger. not entirely sure
farful[9k\]: at least that was the purpose of s4];B[ol]C[Gus: Actually I think thi s move is great. 

Oceandrop (Black):

I think this was an error from me, I think he could have killed my corner group with Q2?]
(;W[mr]
(;B[pr]C[Gus: SLACK move by black. Inconsistent with p8. P8 attempts to cover white. B should continue with his plan since white ignored it. 

Malkovich from White:
farful[9k\]: well q2 settles it. it's alive i think];W[sq]C[Gus : W also misses the point]
;B[sr]C[Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: i think i need t3, both to attack his group and so he doesn't go s5 and kkill my group]
;W[sp];B[rs]
(;W[om];B[nm]C[Oceandrop (Black):
I think it was best to hold white in with this move, but not sure because of the weaknesses in the shape.]
;W[pm]C[Malkovich from White:
farful[9k\]: i really wanted to atari o5 from n6... but looks like i missed the chance
farful[9k\]: i thought p7 looked good, but it was a reading error it seems...]
;B[nl]C[Gus: defending is good Black's center thickness is guaranteed now. The B corner is as big as the right side group (almost) and both have a weak group, but black got thickness as well and is therefore leading

Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: he'll defend o8 cut.. whcih means i need to figure out what to do wiht my n3 group

Oceandrop (Black):
I think I had to defend?];W[hq]C[Gus: Yet another Crazy move. At your levels this is the most common mistake. Creating a second weak group near an already weak group.]
(;B[hp];W[gp]C[Malkovich from White:
farful[9k\]: g4 = making things complicated... he might try j4 and abandon f3
farful[9k\]: which i think is the best option for him
farful[9k\]: if he goes g3 i'll be happy to go j5 and atari

Oceandrop (Black):
I thought about J4, but thought it was too easy on him? But maybe not, because I could still jump into the corner, so maybe G3 big mistake?]
;B[gq];W[ip];B[ho]C[Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: is j5 an overplay? can he cut at j3?]
(;W[jq];B[io]C[Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: w j5, b j3, w h2, b j2, i think it is an overplay]
;W[iq]C[Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: i think he should f5 at this point?];B[fo]C[Gus: This result is not good for black. White fixed his group, but black is still not fully settled.]
;W[ep]C[Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: gonna set up a wall with g6 f6];B[fp];W[gn];B[go]
;W[fn]C[Oceandrop (Black): I was thinking over C17, or F15, Tengen or R17. I played F15 to defend against an invasion at H17, maybe too small thinking?

Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: i wonder how painful e5 will be for me...];B[fe]
;W[fg]C[Oceandrop (Black):

After this move from white, I felt that it was a mistake to play F15, I just forced him to make a good move that did enlargen his potential territory/moyo with his F6 stones, what could I have done better? Was F15 already the losing move? I am not strong in estimating territory.]
;B[jg];W[nd]C[Gus: Ssrange invasion by W 4th line emphasizes the center but black has a TON of thickness in the center. Still difficult for w no matter how he plays in this area.]
(;B[nc]C[Gus: Don't touch weak stones... never ever. This give b an extra move to make shape

Malkovich from White:

farful[9k\]: at some point i should go d2

Oceandrop (Black):

Maybe I should have played at P17 instead of attatching? So P17 would have helped me, without providing him with help?]
