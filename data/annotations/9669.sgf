C[Played on Tygem, as White. Enjoyed it and an early game for me since becoming more serious about playing.

Felt I was strong and in the lead however at some point allowed myself to fall behind. Lost a large group early.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pq]C[[Bryan\] Funny, same opening as a game I just played before doing this review. :D]
;B[jd];W[qo]C[Not sure if this is too slow, however felt the need to be secure

[Bryan\] Personally my gut reaction to sanrensei is to approach immediately. The reason is that by approaching first, you can kind of dictate a decent outcome. I think if B starts with an extra move in sanrensei, he has a big advantage. I'm just making stuff up though.]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[cp]C[Unsure how to respond to this, tried to keep corner]
;W[cq];B[bp]
(;W[bq]C[[Bryan\] Slow, consider some other moves at this stage (see branches). This is slow because the corner is worth much less than the rest of the board. Don't get me wrong - it's a big move somewhere near the beginning of the endgame you want to grab, but at this point, black will grab too much compensation. For argument's sake, let's say you secured around 4 points here.]
;B[ck]C[[Bryan\] Black secured around 4 points, plus the potential for a few more.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[pj]C[Seemed right Joseki for us both I guess...

[Bryan\] Almost. Q10 is too far IMO. What I've found is that you should play moves that you know you can play. In other words, play safe if you don't think you can handle the complications that result from playing fast and loose. For example, what happens if black decides to take advantage of the shape weakness at R13?

For that reason, I'd recommend R11 first. It protects the weakness decently well but isn't as slow as R12 or something.]
;B[jp]C[[Bryan\] I like this idea from B. I think I might go low (3rd line). The reason is that with W on both sides, there might be too much pressure for this to actually be beneficial to B.]
;W[jq];B[kq]C[I played at A, thinking to solidify my corner, but perhaps I was strong enough to cut at B?

Had a play with some variations here, feel free to disregard them.]

(;W[jr];B[kr];W[ip];B[ks]C[[Bryan\] Eh, I don't why I see this all the time in 16k+. K1 is the end game move. But it's also an END GAME MOVE.]
;W[js];B[io];W[mr]C[Thought this was nice, but is the timing right for it?

Think it's a bit early as haven't protected the cut

[Bryan\] I've mentioned my philosophy earlier: leave cuts if you have read all the variations and you're safe. Don't leave cuts if you haven't.

IMO it's easier to throw stones on the board and let your opponent mess up than to respond correctly to random stones thrown on the board. This is what a lot of online players do. The counter to that is to play what you know you're capable of playing.

So the right answer here, I think, is whatever you think you're capable of at this moment.

Now, the cut is great - it gives a few points and gives black some breathing room. But sacrificing those three stones might be worth it if you can make it worth it. I don't think I could. I would've protected, but playing passive is a big weakness of mine right now. :(]
;B[iq];W[ir]
(;B[hq];W[hr];B[gr];W[hp];B[gq];W[gs];B[hs];W[rd];B[rc];W[dn]
C[[Bryan\] I generally avoid this shape. It leaves too many weaknesses. Considering the state of the bottom group, I think a safer play is required (non contact).]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[pe];W[qg];B[re];W[rf];B[se];W[sf];B[sd]C[Lost some territory and helped Black get strong in cornet trying to slide in and around.

[Bryan\] No problems here. Something like a 3-4 point total swing isn't a huge deal at the moment, and now you have sente. Usually B ends up with the corner in this situation anyways. (Can I just say, I hate playing against sanrensei.)]
;W[ng]C[[Bryan\] Knight's move is more appropriate here IMO. If you're feeling frisky go for a large knight's move, then cry in a corner like me. :(]

(;B[en]C[[Bryan\] This is awkward. The stone starts with 3 liberties and is already surrounded by white stones, who can use forcing moves to get even stronger.]
;W[do]C[[Bryan\] I think you could've punished this move more. I think he's inviting you to pressure/capture it and get into a much better position. I think it would be beneficial for you to recognize when the opponent makes this type of blunder.]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[is]C[First loss, again think I should have cut his stones when first placed but still feel strongish, though guess I'm a little too over concentrated?

[Bryan\] These stones were lost a long time ago. Honestly, I don't know why B decided to play this. He lost a point in the end and gave you sente.]
;W[fr]C[[Bryan\] I think you could argue some usefulness here. I think it's up to you to decided if making this group feel nice and cozy is worth losing one of the big points on the board still open.]
;B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[er];B[fo];W[eo];B[em];W[dl];B[ek]C[[Bryan\] Again the problem here is that B leaves too many weaknesses. I haven't seen the rest of the game yet so I don't know if you punish, but if not, then that's something to improve on.

I'll stop here with actual comments, since I don't like to overload. :) I'll summarize my main points at the end. Looking forward to seeing how this turns out!]
;W[fn]C[Perhaps better to keep building the wall up D? Had a ladder breaker so thought I'd have a go

[Bryan\] D9 would be better than F6 at this point. You won't gain much from F6 unless he lets you. I think there are bigger points though. I actually want to invade somewhere around D13 right now. That breaks up B's moyo, easy to live, and the weakness at D9 and thereabouts helps with the invasion.]
;B[go];W[el];B[fm];W[gn];B[fl];W[dj];B[dk];W[hn]C[Maybe turn to G7 instead?

[Bryan\] If you're intent on saving this stones, I think this might work. The extra liberty enables you to at least try to run while pressuring the cut at F9.]

;B[cf];W[df];B[eg];W[ce];B[de];W[bf];B[ef];W[cf]C[[Bryan\] Going to mention this because it's a mistake that people grow out of really fast, so I think it's worth mentioning before the reason you learn how to fix it is by losing a game. :)

The mistake here is that C14 does nothing for your life and death. Losing sente is a huge deal in a life and death problem. "Hi, would you like to stab me first?"]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[cj]
(;W[cl];B[ci]
(;W[ch]C[This is the group I lose, think I should have abandoned earlier

[Bryan\] IMO, yes, but the group was alive. The two mistakes you made were a) tenuki at C8 and b) responding to ataris that shouldn't concern you. So in fact, it took 3 blunders to kill this group, which usually means the group was pretty well alive.

The more important question (which I'll let you stew on, since I think thinking on it yourself will make you stronger in the end) is: would making this group live result in a favorable outcome for B or W? Consider: influence, walls, and territory gained.]
;B[bj];W[aj]C[[Bryan\] At this point, I'd say move on. You can leave all these moves for ko threats.]
;B[ak];W[ai];B[ag];W[bl]C[[Bryan\] I think you did a good job with this C6 group.]
;B[bk];W[af];B[bd];W[cd];B[cc]C[I played A, B is me seeing if I couldn't come around to make another eye.

Curious if there was any hope for the group at all]

(;B[be];W[bc];B[bb];W[ah]C[Trying to buy more liberties, perhaps this should have been done sooner? Or maybe not at all]
;B[ac];W[ae];B[bg];W[je]C[Finally give up on the group, though with the next move....]
;B[ad]C[I wonder if there was still a chance? I don't think so.

[Bryan\] Nopes. B wastes a lot of moves in this game. I challenge you to spot them! B starts dancing in the middle of your fight, but you usually just watch him twerk this game. :) If you recognize, "Hey, I don't need to respond to that...", you'll jump a couple of stones in strength at least instantly.]
;W[ne]C[Thinking here to try and contain black and build moyo in the center. Blacks walls are a worrk though I think with the support I have on the right it could be strong]

[Bryan\] If you ever study stronger player's games, I'd recommend paying special attention to the players do with these types of "peep" (forcing a move to prevent good shape) moves. You do seem to be determined to save every stone (while I need to be more determined to save stones :P). Check out some Go Seigen games. Don't worry about understanding, just pay attention to how he sacrifices while still coming out on top.]

;W[mq];B[lr];W[ms]C[[Bryan\] I think both sides played well for their level, and I congratulate both of you on a good game. The general feeling I get is that you're skipping ahead in your Go education: start with the basics, then go up from there. You seem to be trying to apply some higher level concepts without a grasp of the concepts from your current level. I found that in the DDKs, studying life and death and tesuji can quickly move you to SDK territory (or low DDK) without any special knowledge (even joseki). 

But as promised, a quick summary of the main points I'd love for you to take away, and hope they'll make you a stronger player!

- Life and death, it's nice.
- Don't play a move unless you're confident you can play any variation of any response (excluding tenuki)
- Start trying to recognize big vs. small, urgent vs. who-cares-I'll-play-somewhere-else

There's a couple of branches there if you want to look at them. I just made a small branch whenever I felt strongly enough about my automatic response to B's (or W's?) move.]
