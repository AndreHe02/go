C[Dear reviewer, I was playing this game at DGS, and it seems I failed to keep balance somehow. Please review for white. I will mark my questions by 'Q'.

-H-: Hello, I am your reviewer.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[po]

(;W[qj]C[-H-: This White move only hinders Black's development but doesn't advance White's.

The natural move would be to approach the top right corner with P16 or O16. This prevents Black from making another shimari and is also a kind of extension from the two hoshi stones on the left.]
;B[qm];W[qg];B[oc]C[-H-: Now the two White stones on the right have no further potential. There is no threat to either black corner.]
;W[jq];B[cn]
(;W[co]C[-H-: This is generally a bad idea if white doesn't already have a stone around D10. The reason is that after Black extends, White has to defend at F4, so Black gets the ideal extension on the left side. Afterwards, the white corner is still open at C3, and Black has a strong group at the outside.]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[cj]C[-H-: This result is good for Black. Remember that C5 does not defend the corner.]
;W[jc];B[cf];W[ce]C[-H-: Here, Black already has C10 in place, so this attachment seems even a bit worse than the one at C5. However, there might be a little bit of overconcentration in Black's position, so this loss is perhaps a bit less severe. Black is clearly ahead now.]
;B[df];W[fd];B[lq]
(;W[jo]C[-H-: Since White is behind, he should try to play a bit more active. Probing at Q2 might be a good timing now.

K5 also has the problem that you defend a territory that is still open at the other side.]
;B[cq]C[-H-: White is getting outplayed a bit.]
(;W[dq]C[Q: C4 instead?

-H-: D3 looks a bit submissive. C4 gives away some points, but you also can regain the initiative.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[cp];W[bq];B[do];W[cr];B[lc];W[je]C[-H-: If Black invades C17 now, do you want to defend in the same manner as at the lower side? That would be not enough: 25 points in each of your territories plus 4 on the right plus 6 komi is 60, but Black has 25 on the left plus 18 in the top right plus 25 in the lower right, which is 68, and he has sente.]

C[-H-: Good. You found a plan to try and get back into the game. It is difficult, however.]
;B[pf];W[og];B[pk];W[mp];B[mq]
(;W[mo]C[-H-: This is too slow. Black can play Q10 now to reduce the centre.

It is difficult to find a good way to make many points in the centre here. Black has plays around L15 and F6 and Q9 already poke in.]
;B[lp]C[-H-: Also too slow.];W[nk];B[gk];W[gl];B[hl];W[gm]C[-H-: It seems that G9 was an overplay.]
;B[mm];W[mn]
(;B[ml]C[-H-: Very daring.];W[nq];B[nr];W[np];B[or];W[om]C[-H-: Good attack.]
;B[nl];W[ol];B[ok]
(;W[mk];B[lk]
(;W[ll]C[Q: This move seems to be loser move. Maybe N11 or O11 or M10 would be better?

-H-: Intuitively I would play O11, but the other moves you suggest have merit, too.]

(;B[em];W[bf];B[bg];W[ae];B[nd];W[rg];B[qi];W[re];B[rd];W[sf]
;B[sd];W[se]C[-H-: Looking at the result of the ko fight, White has gained a lot in the top left, especially regarding that the territory at the top was open from C18 before that was captured. In exchange, you had to ignore K12, so the centre is almost destroyed, but I think that exchange favours White.

The gap is closer now.]
(;B[fl]C[-H-: Capturing at L11 would be much bigger for Black, because there is no territory attached to E9.]

(;W[hk]
(;B[fk];W[li];B[ig];W[ji]C[-H-: White regains some centre territory.]

-H-: In conclusion, White played a much worse opening than Black. While he didn't have worse middle game skills at all, it was not possible to come back in the end. 

In the opening, it is important to make moves that have as many uses as possible. Try to get a feeling for the possible developments from your own as well as your opponent's stones. Studying opening themes will likely help your progress the most at the moment.]
