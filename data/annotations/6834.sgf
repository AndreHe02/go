AB[pd][dp][pp];W[dd]C[CG: It is hard to comment on the white side in a handicap game - of course white will try to play overplays.
I will nevertheless try to point out moves I consider mistakes and answer your questions.]
;B[jc];W[cn]LB[qn:A]C[I also considered "A"

CG: I would also play this move. The lower right is not so urgent - you do not know which approach move there is better (R6 or O3)- or do you?]
;B[co];W[dn];B[gq];W[dj]C[I don't know joseki here. Is this too high. Also, how do I punish black's large knight's move, or can I?

CG: Well, there is no Joseki because C5 was a bad move since there is no black stone around D10. Black's large knight move is not necessarily good: In addition to C3 it leaves aji at E3 (when white gets a stone at J3). Locally, this is a good result for white, D10 is ok.]
;B[cg];W[fc];B[bd];W[bf]LB[cc:A]C[Also considered "A"

CG: ... which would have been the normal move. B14 looks dubious.]
;B[bg]
(;W[ce]C[I played this quickly, think it connected white and cut black. I realised almost right away, that black is still connected. Evidence that B14 was poor?

CG: Yes. I considered C14 instead of C15, but it seems not to be good either.]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[cj];W[ck];B[di];W[ej]C[CG: I would prefer the double hane E11.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[bb]
(;W[da]C[CG: ?? If you knew black could link up, why didn't you separate him first? I think one group should at least become ko.
I think this is the first serious mistake by white.];B[be];W[cf]
;B[af];W[ei];B[dh];W[eg]C[CG: This is gote, isn't it? I would prefer to play tenuki and approach the bottom right corner with R6.]
;B[aj]C[CG: Of course black should play elsewhere - I would play Q10.]
;W[dg]
(;B[bh]C[CG: ?];W[do]C[This looks small. I think I want to use my wall to attack something, but where?

CG: Well, this just destroys the corner aji at C3 and in fact just helps black. 
The black group in the top left is just about 10 points - so why are you in a rush to "attack something"? There is nothing yet to attack, so you should just play normal moves (like e.g. R6, R14 or R10).]
;B[cp];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[fq];W[nq]LB[qn:A]C[Playing on the undeveloped side better?

CG: Common sense would be that the right side is more important - you cannot build up much territory in front of the rock-solid corner in the lower left.]
;B[oq]C[CG: Just R6 would be better.];W[np];B[qm];W[jq];B[mc]
;W[oc]C[CG: An overplay I would not dare to play.];B[pc];W[od]

(;B[qg]C[CG: This is of course a mistake - black should just extend to Q15. Your wall would be neutralized by the two-point extension.]
;W[hc]C[I'm thinking this will help me fight K17 and N17 by stealing their base. Is there a more sensible move?

CG: If black answers at N15 or O15, this is a bad exchange for you. H17 itself is small, so I'd say you have no other choice but move with P16. I can't say which is the best move - O15, P14 or Q15?]
;B[gp];W[go];B[ho];W[gn];B[hn]C[CG: Pushing from behind is bad - black should play around O15.]
;W[hm];B[gm]C[CG: This cut is unreasonable.];W[fn];B[fm]C[CG: Aji-keshi.]
;W[en];B[im];W[hl];B[jp];W[in]C[CG: This cut is not good if black answers correctly.]

(;B[io];W[jn];B[il];W[ik];B[hk];W[gl];B[gk]C[CG: Aji-keshi.]
;W[fl];B[jk]C[CG Aji-keshi.];W[ij];B[jl];W[ln]C[I feel pretty good about this result.

CG: Yes, black played this very badly.];B[kn];W[ko];B[km];W[jo]
;B[kp];W[lp];B[kq];W[lq];B[kr];W[jj];B[kj];W[ml]C[How to attack/kill this little black group?

CG: Hard to say. From the territory point of view L11 is bigger, but it would be easier for black to settle his group. I think N8 is ok.]
;B[lm]C[CG: Aji-keshi and bad shape. Just L11 or M9 would be better.]
;W[mm];B[ki];W[lk]C[CG: Good!];B[kk];W[mi]C[CG: ??];B[hi]C[Big spoon here. Didn't see the danger.

CG: The attack failed, but N11 is not as bad as it looks since it helps P16.]
;W[qk]C[Boxing the corner in so I can attack. Is there a better way?

CG: This move is ok - it strengthens your group and forces black to add another move in the corner.]
