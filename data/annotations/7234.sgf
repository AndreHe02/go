C[Zejety: Hello


Tom: Hi, my name is Tom, GTL assigned me to review your game.  In general, I think the thing that will help your play the most is studying basic life and death problems until all the simple shapes are easily recognizible.  In particular, you could have killed the group in the bottom right corner, which I show later.  Sensei's Library has some good examples, and goproblems.com lets you practice for free.  If you get a little better at reading, your go will improve quite a lot.]
