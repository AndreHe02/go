;B[pf];W[cf]LB[di:A]C[I thought about playing A here instead but felt f16 was fine and worked well with j17.]
(;B[fd]C[Chris: Now Black is slightly overconcentrated on the top.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[di]LB[ch:A]C[This was strange to me and I was looking for a way to use the weakness at A

Chris: Dont force it. when you see a weakness wait until the midgame comes to that place. immediatedly white will have the disadvantage fighting there.]
;B[qn]LB[ck:A][ql:B]C[Trying to sketch out the right side territory and see how white responds.
Chris: Correct direction. A would probably be premature as a white move at B would be gigantic.]
;W[ip]C[I'm looking at invading the left now but I want to press white low on the bottom first.]
;B[pp];W[pq];B[np];W[oq];B[dp]LB[pp:A][np:B][nn:C]C[somewhat of a probe to see which side white wants to block on
Chris: If you play AB you need to finish the shape with C. If you want to probe, do it beforehand.]
;W[cp];B[op]LB[do:B][mo:A][nn:C][ch:D]C[This might be better at A?
Keeps white low, I don't want to continue pusing at B because j4 is perfectly placed then. Also I want to be able to put a little pressure on j4 from this side to try and use d4 some.

Chris: C is the normal shape point, A looks playable too. Tenuki from the left side is unbearable though. The hane at B is too powerful. After white gets such a strong group on the left, the aji is much better for white now.]
;W[do];B[nq]C[White ignores so I block in sente.]
(;W[nr];B[mr]C[This may not be sente but I'm aiming at the bottom to be able to use d4.]
;W[or];B[ck]SQ[np][nq][op]LB[do:A][gp:B]C[Connecting n2 looks too passive and the bottom is very open so I invade the left; I would have liked b17 before invading but it seems to just force white to fix the left.

Chris: Indeed connecting is passive as it is not facing any black moyo. The left side is too solid to invade without any black stones around (because of A).

I would have invaded around B to see if Black can start using the thickness he just built.]
;W[ek]
(;B[dn]LB[co:A][fn:B][en:C]C[probe, make some aji.
Chris: Not a very good probe as White should remove the problematic cutting point at A. if black B white C and blacks shape is a bit funny. the J4 stone would be an attacking stone.]
;W[en]C[Chris: White is giving you more cuts, you have a fighting chance!]
;B[bi]LB[ch:A]C[I thought about A instead but with the corner still open it seems easy for white.

Chris: The question is, is it easy for black. if you live painfully, whites centre wall will be overwhelming.]
;W[ci];B[bh];W[bc]LB[dg:A]C[I think I can cut first at A before going back to live?
Chris: Yes probably];B[co];W[eo];B[cn]LB[en:A]C[Chris: See how whites hane at A, that gives black many cutting points to work with was a bad idea for attacking? the proverb says, play solid and away when you attack, attach to stones when you defend. i think this is a nice example, as black should have lived with 2 or 3 points, but got around 10 instead!]
;W[lp];B[lq]C[I'm very happy with this exchange

Chris: Yes well spotted! i hope you said "thank you" to your opponent ;)]
;W[jj]LB[lp:A]C[Chris: Bad move by white, he is too open everywhere. this time it is white who is ignoring a contact move, so black should exploit this fact.]
;B[rp];W[rq]

[rk:C][pi:D][ph:E]C[Chris: Usually you nobi in one direction. these are the 4 options. Take E into account (stones at the head of 2 stones are good shape and so on).

maybe if you try some out, just 4-5 moves, it will benefit your game in the future, as they are a great way of creating something out of nothing ^^]

Chris: Yes now white can play the driving tesuji.];W[oj];B[pi]
;W[oi];B[qi];W[qh];B[ri];W[oh]C[Chris: If we count terretory now, we can see, that white needs to make only around 15 points of terretory in the center to win. if you lost the game it was this exchange]
;B[lj]C[This is probably too early, I overlooked my weakness at P14

Chris: yes white suddenly got very thick];W[li]C[Chris: again white attaches to attack. bad idea, black has a chance to maneouver. best repeat it 100 times each day as well ^^ attach to defend, play away to attack ^^]
