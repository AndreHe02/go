C[This game is from Turkey Go Championship. I played with white. I am 1 kyu. My opponent is 1 dan.
I would like to thank you for your time and your concern. At the end of the review if you tell me about my weaknesses and what should I study, I would be appriciated. Thank you.

(;W[nd]LB[oc:A]C[After the game I think that black was overplayed here. I think I should split black stones with m17 or l17. O16 looks bad

SGF:  The position of Bh17 makes the top left corner very unintersting as neither side has an extension worth playing.  That means that an position B makes at the top has little scope for expansion.  On the other hand, if W plays at A after B's hane then H17 is also a little to far.  So I don't necessarily think this is the wrong move as much as the next one.    I do not think an splitting move on the third line works.  See the variation.  If you are going to pincer L16 looks better.]

(;W[nf]C[SGF: Seems to limid.  What is wrong with the hane?]
;B[mf];W[ng]LB[mc:B][od:A]C[B is very happy from this , right ? My choose was wrong.

SGF: But W also has a huge potential on the side.  B has ended up with a 4-stone wall with a 4-point extensive.  That is too close.  Black cannot push at A because if the cut at B.  I think I slightly prefer the white position here.]
;B[cn];W[jq]LB[ie:A][mg:B]C[This move also wrong I think. Maybe E2 ?

SGF: Definitely not E2.  It is way too early in this game.  If white does no play at the bottom what will black do there? Probably he would play K4 or K3.  Then would be the time to consider E2.  I think this move is okay, but I would prefer to play on the fourth line and aim at the points A and B.]
;B[eq]
(;W[mq]LB[qm:A]C[SGF:  This in not urgent as an extension on each side becomes miai.  I think I would prefer to variation at A to strengthen the right side.]
;B[hq]LB[df:D][pi:C][dj:B][gq:A]C[SGF:  This is not a good move as it is an extension from strength.  White is relutant to play at A this early because the position would be too low.  Other moves for black to consider at B, C oe D]

(;W[mo]LB[di:C][qm:A][oo:B]C[SGF:  THe bottom side is not urgent.  It would be better to exchange A for B before this move, but I think the left side is bigger.  How about C?]
;B[ql];W[oj];B[cg]C[SGF:  This is why the left side was bigger than the bottom.]

(;W[he]LB[ee:B][ie:A]C[I don't know is this ok or not. By doing this move I thought that b should defend then I can attack c13 .

SGF: A would have been better earlier but now, with C13 on the board, black can counter attack.  Perhaps take it slowly by playing B.  The move played doesn't really seem to achieve anything as it is a little too far from the corner to be considered connected.]
;B[jc]LB[ee:A]C[SGF: This seems too submissive. I would be more include to counterattack with A.]
;W[dj]LB[he:A]C[SGF:  Because A is not connected to the corner this is a little ambitious.]
;B[eg];W[dh];B[dg]
(;W[fi]C[SGF:  This is not usually consider good shape.  It is referred to as the saki bottle.]

C[SGF:  White does not have time for this because of the cut at A.   If white does play A then black does not have time for the corner because of B, so white can still play there later.]
;B[hj];W[gk]C[Here I thought if black makes J10 now, I can pursue him but I couldn't do it well.]
;B[ij];W[jh]C[SGF: why not jump one more?  Then black cannot press.]
;B[ki];W[kh];B[li]
(;W[lh]LB[mg:A][mi:B]C[SGF: Pushing black from behind does not work.  Siimply playing at A ensures a connection and does not force black to emcrpach any further.]
;B[ni];W[oi];B[nh];W[oh];B[mg];W[mh];B[lk]
(;W[mi]LB[jj:A]C[SGF: Check out the variation from the move at A.  The one shown is not the only one, but white wants to avoid gote.]
;B[im]LB[bh:B][ml:A]SQ[jh][fi]C[SGF:  White now had two weak group, at the left and the bottom.  He must be careful not to play anything which weakens them further.  Black can also threaten to pull out the two stones in atari. I think a move at A deserves serious consideration.  It helps the lower group, reenforces against the pull out of the two stones, and does not weaken the left group.  Another possibilities is to secure the left group with B and wait to see what black does.  The problem is that white has got into a lot of trouble by the bad shape moves at the marked points and black has taken advantage of it well]
;W[ol];B[nn]C[This was a good move I think. He force me to defend o12 stones and connect his middle group. Maybe my P8 was wrong.]

(;W[mn]C[SGF:  The bottom can live as long as black does not because strong above it. So white needs a move which secures the two stones in atari while also threatening the stones in the middle.]
;B[nm]C[SGF: White is force black to go in the direction he does not want him to go.  This exchange strengthens black more than white.]
;W[nl];B[mm]
(;W[jo]C[I feel that I should do this move. I scared from n3 group to die but if I ignore this move and play c8 or somewhere else , would my group will be in danger ?

SGF: I don't think it would die.  But if could be attacked.  I tried a couple of simple variations. white seems safe.]

(;B[ck]C[He take this move and its big actually.

SGF: I think it is the wrong attack.  White can just connect underneath.  Look what happens if black separates.]
;W[bh]C[I decide to connect immediately but was it wrong ? Is this passive move ? Can my G9 group live comfortably in the middle ?

SGF:  The problem with getting cut off is that even if it lives black will get a lot of territory on the lower left.  I think this is best.]
;B[eb];W[pm];B[rn];W[qm];B[rm]LB[op:A]C[SGF:  Bad exchange.  It gains nothing for white but solidifies black.  If you want  to play around here I would prefer A]
;W[fh]C[SGF: What is the purpose here?  It is almost dame.  White needs to be looking to the lower left.]

;W[ag]LB[cl:A]C[SGF: Did you consider A?  If black descends you can still live in the corner.  It is not clear which is bigger.]

SGF:  Yes, it is very difficult now.];B[ch]
(;W[bi]LB[cm:A]C[SGF: This does not help.  Try A for better shape, leaving this as a threat if black attacks the corner.]

SGF: Black should probably just kill the corner and end the game,]

(;W[nj]C[SGF:  You probably need to resist and hope to live.  The rest if just yose.  Black has won the game so I will not add any more comments.  Black did play the yose much better and ended wining by almost 30 points.  White too many shape points and left black off to easily]
