[ef][ff][ag][bg][bh][ai][bi][bj][ak][bk]C["Corner golden, Sides silver, Centre straw". What does this mean?
It means the corner is best, then side, and corner last. This is because it is easier to make 2 eyes in these places. You want to make 2 eyes easily because it is more efficient. less stones used to make life, more stones to use to make your territory.

Corner: 6 stones
Side: 8
centre: 11

Application of this theory explains a lot in the beginning. Why do players play around the sides? Easier to make a base, that's why.
Why do groups without a base in the side or corner die? Living in the centre takes too many stones and is hard, that's what.]

In particular, I'd like to go through the intention of your stones, and how to make them more efficient. (efficiency is what wins your game.) AND the "corner golden, side silver, centre straw" theory.]
;B[pj]LB[de:A]C[This move is OK. Extending in the beginning and 'mapping out' potential territory is a good idea.
A better move is [A\]. White's (from now on White will be referred to as 'W'.) stone is 'facing' black (D4). Usually W will want to play around A because it encirlces the corner and almost guarantees W a corner at the end. To prevent this from happening, B(black) plays around A. The positions on the left hand side favour B's placement at A. 
Why?
B has a back-up stone at D4 and many W's replies will strengthen the relationship between A and D4. That's good for B.]
;W[cn]
(;B[do]C[What did you want to achieve with this stone?
Did you want extend out? Take the corner? Stop W coming in?
In any case, playing a 'contact move' (playing next to it, in this case, a diagonal move is also considered a contact move) is not good. It strengthens W and B has better moves to make.]

(;B[co]TR[do][dp]C[Bad shape. We call it an empty triangle. For a shape with 3 stones, it has the least possible liberties. 
It's good for the opponent to take advantage of this shape.

Of course W will not want to be surrounded, but B has another plan in mind.]

The example shown isn't a good play by the way, W can play in between them and pincer two at the same time. It will be a lot of fighting.]

;W[em]C[Of course, W can deviate from this, but the general motive is to jump out.]
;B[fo];W[dh]C[Yep, more fighting. But as long as you work out which group is weakest (here, it is D9, all by itself and surrounded by W) and help it jump out (it has 3 options, up, down and centre. Centre is the only one direction left) you should have a good fight.]
