(;B[hc]C[JR:   I'd have ignored the white move.   This is a small extension and black is not under a threat of death in the top so its not needed to secure your group.

Something like the alternatives would be bigger];W[ic];B[hb]
;W[jf];B[gf]C[JR   Notice that now you got yourself thinking it was necessary to make a territory (of only a few points) on the top.

Now you're thinking you don't want to get shut in. OK in itself but a bit limiting.]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[ib]
(;B[fq]C[JR

The white group has little eye space. White would love to play an approach move on the top which also formed a more 3 dimensional shape which would develop into territory.

At some stage you can threaten it a little by playing there before white makes the group safe.

Ok you're not going to kill it but its worth doing sometime.

If you're going to do this you'd perhaps like a stone on k4. Makes it look a little more like white's surrounded. So perhaps play that first then attack]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[kp]C[JR Thats a slightly thin extension. Usually k4 - 3 spaces away would be the right distance to stay connected. L4 is not gaining anything being 1 space closer to the right

Now you can expect white to invade some time in the future. Notice that all your troubles at the end of the game stem from such an invasion.]
;W[lc]
(;B[nc]C[JR: White's got some shape now. It does not realistically look like you can kill so are there bigger moves than this?]

(;W[mb]C[JR

This feels  end game by white. I'd prefer to move towards the middle to make shape. This has the advantage of moving towards the black moyo and reducing it somewhat.]
;B[nb];W[le];B[oj]C[JR: Yes, white has played in a cramped fashion, this expands very nicely.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[qn]
(;B[rl]C[JR:

The wrong idea I think. Taking away the base from white's stones is not the right thing. Here S8 is not terribly useful to white, white will want to run away as fast as possible.   The aim is to make territory while chasing white. If necessary let white live small on the side and gain iutside strength which combines with your position on the bottom.

Therefore black should look at playing O4 to expand territory or perhaps play  a capping move.]
;W[ql];B[rk];W[nn];B[np]
(;W[ol]C[White should just keep running];B[mn];W[no];B[mo];W[ml]
C[JR: White got more out of this sequence than black.

A general rule is contact plays are for defence, more distant plays for attack.

The contact at N6 let white create a cutting point at N4 and still run smothly away . White also has reasonable eye shape as well.]
;B[mj];W[po]
(;B[ro]C[JR:   Since white is looking more alive you need to keep an eye on your own defence.

Drawing back leaves fewer gaps for white to push at.];W[op]

C[JR:   Where is this invasion going? If you plan to run away the safety is to the bottom. But white can block that route and will threaten his own invasion. White is therefore likely to get a sente move in the chase sometime.

I would prefer C8 to D8. you can still threaten to run away but you also have the option of trying to live inside. This should be possible if white blocks the escape route.

Better still might be invading around C12 .   Firstly G14 is looking round the white stones so a connection is easier.

Secondly B14 is a follow up threatening to connect under the white group - so it will be easier to make life.

Thirdly white will have to worry about keeping his own top group alive.]
;W[em];B[el];W[fj];B[fm]
(;W[gl]C[JR: Was this a white mis-click? Cutting at F8 would seem the natural follow up to E7]
;B[fl];W[hp];B[gn];W[hn]
(;B[go]C[JR: OK what is black's first objective here?

Unless black can connect its going to be a struggle to live, and if the group dies its the game gone. Connection will be along the bottom if at all

An alternative might be to to look to live on the side. Not sure if its better.]

It's rather complicated but, do you think the white group K3 could live?   If he play M2, I'll answer with N3 because of the dangerous L7 stone.Then if wN2, bO2 or wO2, bN2. If wS3, bR2 ???

White seems very confident playing his L3 stone=
.And a D5 black stone would be so dammaging that black must end any fight w=
ith sente?

However I think white does better to keep this in reserve. One extra stone could make all the difference]

This way makes a safer shape so the white cutting stone is dead and black keeps the bottom as solid territory.]

(;B[np];W[pk];B[pj]C[White still has to run. Trying to live on the side would give black the chance of huge development on the bottom.

Also by peeping atQ9 white has strengthened blackon top as well.

This is as it should be, white was jumping into black's domain and fighting at a severe disadvantage. Black ought to get lots of benefit in suvch circumstances.]

Black lets him and plays f6 or something nice like that.])

if white invades chase these stones, making territory on the bottom but also moving up towards the centre from R10. This again makes the white group look vulnerable.]

If white does not pincer];W[cn];B[jp]C[K4 is a good point with the bottom right. you're expecting white to invade sometime, thats the whole point of your opening, so you will be happy to chase some white stones into the centre while taking 4th line territory on the bottom. K4 will help this.]

You could simply decide that white hads missed the chance and you wanted to make the corner more secure]

(;B[lc]C[JR:

If you want to play on the top why not expand from your 4-4 stone. There's some sort of pincer effect on white's last stone and you'll be happy to play M15 to develop the top if white forces you to.]
