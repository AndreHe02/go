AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[B: Hi, I'm Bart and I'll try to review your game.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or]
;W[qr];B[nq];W[iq];B[kq];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[eo]LB[cn:A]C[B: alternative would be to play at A.]
;W[fo];B[jo]LB[en:A]TR[fo]C[B: and after white played the marked stone, you can play at A to develop the side.]
;W[ho];B[fm]C[B: this might be a bit loose and can give trouble later on. See variation.]

(;W[dj];B[jm]LB[cn:B][mn:A]C[B: good to put pressure on white and develop area A, but I think white can live and will attack area B.]
;W[dm]
(;B[dn]LB[en:A]C[B: maybe better to connect your stones at A. You can still defend part of the corner if white plays there, and you put more pressure on white. See variation.]
;W[cm];B[cn];W[cf];B[ce]LB[bd:A][ch:B]C[B: this strengthens white. If you play a little bit further away, for instance at A, white has to do something about the gap at B.]
;W[df];B[fd]C[B: and white can still live in the corner.];W[ff]
;B[hf]LB[ic:A][em:B]C[B: this move seems a bit off the mark. The white group is alive and this move doesn't help your area at the top.
B: I'd prefer to play at A. Or fix the gap at B.]
(;W[el];B[hm]LB[fl:B][em:C][ho:A]C[B: if you can kill white's group A, this is good. Otherwise it's better to play B or C.]
;W[qh];B[qf]C[B: good];W[qk]
(;B[pl]LB[ol:A]C[B: good, or play directly at A.];W[pk];B[ol]
;W[ok];B[nk];W[nj]
(;B[nl]LB[mk:A]C[B: a bit defensive. I think you can play at A. That also protects the cut and keeps you ahead of white.]
;W[mj]
(;B[kk]LB[mc:B][og:A]TR[jj]C[B: here I think you can play aroud A or B. A keeps pressure on white and B develops your area at the top. The move you made doesn't really help your area below, and the marked stone is quite safe already.]
;W[og]C[B: now white plays here first and makes points.];B[mf]
LB[mc:A]C[B: again, I would play a bit closer to the side (around A). White is already strong and this move is a bit too far away from the side to help there.]
;W[oe]
(;B[ne]C[B: danger! See comment on next move and variations.]

(;W[mg]LB[od:A]TR[pd][qf]SQ[ne][mf]C[B: white has A now. That cuts your groups and leaves you with two weaker groups (the triangles and the squares).]
;B[li]LB[jd:B][od:A]C[B: you van still play A. Or B.];W[kc]
;B[id];W[nc];B[md];W[mc];B[oc];W[ob];B[pb];W[nb];B[nd];W[od]

(;B[of]LB[pc:A]C[B: a mistake, I think. Should have been at A.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pe];B[qd]LB[qb:A][pf:B]C[B: good solution. You have to many weaknesses to fight.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pa]
(;B[pf]LB[qe:A]C[B: I'd prefer the other side at A. See variation.]
;W[qe];B[re]C[B: good, I overlooked the atari, so you get another move.]
;W[oc];B[sd]C[B: good. Or at S16.]
(;W[ic];B[ra]C[B: I think you're already safe over there. See variation.]
;W[qa]LB[gb:A]C[B: white could have played at A now.];B[sc]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[er];B[dr];W[fr];B[hc]C[B: good];W[hd]
(;B[jc]LB[gc:A]C[B: or strengthen your stones by connecting at A.]
;W[ib];B[gd];W[he];B[ge];W[ie];B[gc];W[if];B[hg];W[ig];B[gj]
;W[fi];B[gi];W[gh];B[hh];W[gg];B[lg]LB[gf:A]C[B: if you keep your stones connected at A, your stones are stronger.]
;W[mh];B[ke];W[jd];B[jg]LB[ih:A]C[B: should be at A, then you protect the points there.]
;W[ih]C[B: ouch.];B[jh]TR[kf][kg][kh][ki]SQ[hi][ii][hj][ij]
[gk][hk][ik][jk][gl][hl][il][jl]C[B: the squared area is bigger and more important than the triangle area.]
;W[gf];B[ii];W[fa]TR[hf][hg][hh]C[B: white didn't see it, or found the move it made bigger.]
;B[fb];W[ha];B[ea];W[ga];B[eb];W[hi]C[B: yes.];B[hj];W[in];B[jn]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[en];B[do];W[fn]C[B: now it is your turn. Find the sente moves. See variations.]

C[B: area is now 6 points. It was 13 points.];W[ql]LB[ml:A]
C[B: from here on, you made some mistakes, as you already mentioned. So I won't comment on it any further. Play at A to protect.]
