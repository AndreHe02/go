C[newsocks [8k\]: hi have fun

***********
Jon,

Hi I'll put all my comments under these asterixes. I don't know if you played black or white so I will review both sides.

-Dave];B[pq]C[Himitsu [10k\]: hi gg];W[dc];B[cp];W[qd];B[od]
(;W[pc]C[********
This move is Joseki, though I don't see it a lot. The variation is more usual.]
;B[oc]
(;W[lc]C[*******
This move is too aggressive. White's two stones are not strong enough. They will be enclosed, which is not a good thing.]
(;B[jc]C[*********
Black should enclose as in the variation. Then he can attack this way.]
;W[kd];B[fc]C[********
Three space extension here is dangerous - white can come in at H17 later, or black will need to spend a move defending this. Only when things are more open and black has room for his stones to deal with that invasion is the three space extension OK. White is too strong here.]
;W[ce];B[pf];W[ib]C[*****
Again, the corner is weak, and white should take care of that.

Locally, this is the wrong place to attack - H17 splits the stones and is more severe.]
(;B[ic];W[jb];B[hb];W[kc];B[ie]C[Black's stones on the left are much stronger now, and white's group is not yet alive and has bad shape..]
;W[qf]C[*******
If black had worked on these stones earlier this would not have been possible]
;B[qg]C[*******
White correctly punishes the hane here which is too aggressive.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[pg];B[of];W[qh];B[pd];W[qe];B[qc];W[rc];B[qb]
;W[ph]
(;B[mf]C[***
White is now very comfortable on the side.

This black attack is good, but should be at L14, capping the white stones. They will have to live locally, and black will get thick outside.]
;W[ob]C[*******
Black should punish this mistake. See variation.]
(;B[pb]C[******
Mistake, see variation.];W[nb];B[rb]C[********
Expanding centerward rather than trying to get eye space is a better idea in general in these circumstances.]
(;W[rg]C[********
I don't know what white is worried about here. Pulling out the black stone doesn't work.]
;B[rd];W[re]C[*******
White can and should play a bigger move like approaching the corners.]
;B[sc]
(;W[qp]C[*****
Contact? R5 is fine here.];B[pp];W[qo];B[po];W[ql];B[qq]C[************
White got a decent side here, but black gained a lot too. White would have been much better off with the R5 move.]
;W[pn];B[on];W[pm]
(;B[om]C[*******
Black should come back and cover his cut instead. It represents an exploitable weakness. Pushing on the 5th line like this when white can hane on top isn't so great.]
;W[jp];B[lp]C[********
Because of the weakness, black needs to push this way, which is much easier for white. This stone is also too close to black's other stones to be efficient for making territory.]
;W[gp];B[eq];W[fq];B[ep];W[cj]C[*********
A good extension by white.];B[cm]C[******
Too tight by black. Black should invade up top, or develop the center.]
;W[mq];B[lq];W[mp]
(;B[lo]C[**************
This is an overplay by white and black needs to punish by hane at the head of two stones, which is a Go rule of thumb.]

Black is better off attacking white now than capturing the white stones.]

Black needs to attack the bottom white stones before they settle!!]

White should help the other stone.];B[dh];W[ej];B[eh];W[eg]
(;B[fi];W[fj];B[gi];W[gj];B[ip]C[**********
This is the wrong place to attack, and because of the white wall above, white has somewhere to go to now.  So this attack is too late and not executed well.]
;W[io];B[hq];W[hp];B[ir];W[gg]C[*************
A bold move by white - risky but playable.];B[hh];W[hg];B[ih]
;W[ig];B[jh];W[gl]C[*********
Good idea by white to unify his groups. Should be at g7 though.]
(;B[fg];W[ff];B[fh];W[ge];B[ef];W[ee];B[df];W[cg]C[*********
White really cannot do this. It is too risky.];B[cf];W[bg];B[bf]

A gift for white.];W[hm];B[im];W[hl];B[jn];W[in];B[km];W[mi]
;B[nh];W[ni]C[*************
Because of the defensive move in the corner, white makes large center profit. This is huge.]
;B[ip];W[jo];B[iq];W[er];B[dr];W[fr];B[fp];W[go]C[******
Saving the bottom is actually bigger because of D1, etc.]

The hane is fine here. White secured three points in sente here.]
;W[an];B[ao];W[al];B[bo];W[hn]C[**********
This is far too soon. You should only play this way once you are in danger of being taken or there is no more profit else where.]

Both players made mistakes, as seen in the comments. Generally white was too aggresive and black was too timid to punish white's overplays.

Black's first major set back was the failure to deal effectively with white's attack on the bottom right group. This was further compounded by not attacking the weak white stones successfully to the left with the thickness gained by that exchange.

Black got the game back due to white making the mistake of trying to save the two stones at D13. Black devastated the corner and nearly cut off another white group.

However, Black's end game was very weak, causing him to lose dozens of points. Most serious problems of the end game were:
  1) The loss of sente with B18, which affected possible points in the center. 
  2) The loss of N9, O9, which was entirely preventable. 
  3)  Failing to cut off the F3 group when white made the mistake of allowing F4 which cut off two groups at once.

White also made mistakes in the end game, but these were not as serious.

I hope you find these comments helpful. It can be hard hearing all the mistakes you have made, but that is the best way to improve. This was an exciting game, with a lot of spirited play on both players part. 

Good luck with your GO!
