AB[pd][dp][pp]C[I was white in this game
Up to move 35 I thought I was doing ok

I felt I had lost at move 192 after that my moves are not worth comments.

Thank you for reviewing!

Hi my name is Floris Barthel. I am a 2d player from the Netherlands and have been asked to review this game for you. I will try my best to provide you with as much study material as possible and I hope it will be useful to you. Please study the variations I give carefully. After all, it is you who must do the work, I just provide the means. If you have any questions please drop me a note at floris.barthel@inter.nl.net]
;W[ed];B[dd]C[This move is very unusual. It's not a normal play.]

it seemed good relative to the joseki for the high aproach to the 3-4 point but I feel I should have done more.

This is peaceful. It's not bad.]

Black is ahead now. But still possible to have good endgame. Yes you must play M5. Center is hopeless.

I stop here. Rest of game is not interesting to comment. Anyways, I hoped you liked the review and you can always drop me a note.

You played well. The key mistakes were skipping the jump to E14 for too long and cutting at move 93.]
