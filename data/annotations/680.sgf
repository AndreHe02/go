[oc:e]C[Q: Is this too weird?  I don't really know what a normal opening looks like.  I have played Sanren-sei and Chinese sometimes because I know generally what you are trying to accomplish with those.  But otherwise, I don't have anything to base the first 3 moves on.

No, this is far from weird.  The 1,3 configuration is a classical opening called 'tasuki'.  You will  find it in any standard fuseki book.  What is unusually is to play it when W has played hoshi.  The reason it is played is that, if W takes the remaining corner, B is guaranteed a shimari.  Not only that, if W then plays an approach againsts B's other stone he will get a perfect extension from the shimari when he approaches the a W corner.  For example  if the first 7 moves are B1, Wa, B3, Wb, Bc, Wd, Be then B 'e' becomes an approach to B and an extension from the shimari.  On the other hand, if W plays at the top to prevent this then B gets two shimari, which is excellent for him.]
BL[572];W[dp]WL[578];B[jp]LB[de:a][jd:b]C[Q: I know you normally make a shimari before making a side extension, but since white played on the 4-4's, if I play at 'a', he will take the big point at 'b'.  So this seemed better.  What do you think?

In view of the explanations for the previous move you can see that this is not correct.  You should make a shimari at 'a' and if Wb then make a second shimari..  As a shimari is worth 15 points you are then well in the lead in secure territory.  Very rarely is it good to let the opponent make two shimari - how often have you seen it in professional games?]
BL[557];W[cf]WL[552];B[ci]LB[fq:a][cn:b][qo:c]C[Joseki calls for one point closer but this is playable.  However, as the two point approach is not very severe I would play at 'a'.  If W responds around 'b' then make a shimari at 'c' to complete the bottom side.]
BL[512];W[bd]LB[cc:a]C[Should be at 'a']WL[537];B[cn]LB[cm:a]
[ch:b]C[Q: Is this good?  It's pretty wide, but it seemed right.

This is difficult for B. You would like to approach from the other side to expand the bottom.  But if you do that W can play at 'a' and B7 is then cramped for space. Compare it to having  B7 at 'b', which is joseki.  I would still play on the lower side however as the potential for terrritory there is greater and the w play at 'a' does leave B some leeway.]
BL[489];W[gq]C[This is why B9 is doubtful.  B's position on the bottom is now undercut and it will be hard to realize anything with it.]
WL[516];B[gc]LB[ed:a][ef:b]C[I would play at 'a'. This threatens to play at 'b' and partially seal W in while making a position at the top. But if W plays 'b' to stop this then B can extend further along the top and Ws play would be dame.]
BL[399];W[cc]WL[501];B[dd]C[Points out the error of B11 - from a two stone wall you should extend 3, not 2.]
BL[368];W[cb]WL[477];B[qf]LB[nc:a][qg:b][kd:c][ic:d]C[W is no very strong at the top left and the three B stones are weak.  If W get to play at 'd' the three stones will come under attack.  To eliminate this you might consider Ba, Wb, Bc]
BL[346];W[mc]WL[453];B[jc]C[Essential.]BL[330];W[rd]C[Timidity in the extreme.  To play a gote move like this in the opening is not usually gote, even though it is big.]
WL[429];B[cq]LB[bp:a][dl:b][po:c]C[Q: My hope here is to take the corner and then live in front of his wall if he blocks at c4.

This is too early.If you live in the corner W will get a strong outside wall.  This will effectively kill off B9 and severely threaten B7.  In addition, W will be able to invade the lower right with impunity as he will have no weak groups.  If you must play in the lower left the sequence Ba, W19, Bb is better.  However, I think that a play at c would be better. This takes territory in the lower right, bulds up influence there and leaves the lower left unsettled for the time so that you can choose between B19 and Ba later.]

;W[bo]WL[387];B[bq]BL[270];W[co]WL[379];B[eq]C[Q: Makes life.  Hopefully it's sente.]
BL[268];W[fp]WL[336];B[bn]C[Heavy.  This is only played if you can attack the W stones. This is unrealistic here.]
BL[247];W[ao]LB[cl:a][dn:b]C[Q:  My main concern here was that I was still alive in the corner after this exchange.  I believed I would be.   You are certainy alive with no problems.  If you now play 'a' you are also alive on the left and W has been outplayed.  W should play at 'b' to create outside thickness in preparation for an attack on the lower right.]
WL[332];B[cl]BL[231];W[ek]C[What is this?  It look like a floater - a target for future attack.]
WL[272];B[en]LB[fm:a]C[Good.  this punishes W for the slack move at 32. 'a' also looks playable.]
BL[221];W[gn]WL[250];B[fm]LB[gm:a]C['a' if more severe.  W cannot easily counterattack.]
BL[203];W[gm]WL[237];B[fl]LB[gl:a]C[Timid.  play at 'a' . W would get into big trouble if he tried to cut.]
BL[197];W[kn]LB[po:a]C[Q: That seems like a success.  Now what?

It was not a success.  By the time W has pushed in on the left you will be lucky to get away with 15pts.  That is too few for the number of stones invested.  You were too timid with B35 and 37.

This W38 looks like another floater.  I would prefer to push one more time and then play at 'a']
WL[224];B[gl]LB[lp:a]C[Q: I couldn't find anything really compelling elsewhere, and this seemed like it would do a lot for my influence and put pressure on his group.

Your perception is correct.  Notice I said on the previous move that W should push one more time before approachign the lower rught corner.  It is this move which made the push necessary.  However, With W38 on the board the push for W in not as attractive anymore (overconcentrated) so it also looses some of its appeal for b.  Perhaps keeping it simple with a move at 'a' is best although one cannot deny the strength of this B39]
BL[185];W[qk]LB[po:a]C[Definitely should be at 'a'  B would not be able to answer that move with a pincer because the bottom is too weak.  W would get to play on the right anyway.]
WL[210];B[qn]BL[122];W[qh]WL[203];B[pg]LB[mp:a]C[Where is this going?  Will saving this stone really help your cause?  What is likely to happen is that you will present W with a target to attack and the fight may spill over to the bottom and then you get no territory there.  Try playing at 'a' and bifing your time over extricating B15.  After all, if W goes back to capture it you get a free move elsewhere.]
BL[103];W[ph]LB[oi:a]C[I would try 'a' aiming at a leisurely attack.  This approach make an invasion of the bottom much easier to achieve.]
WL[190];B[ng]BL[91];W[me]LB[oh:a]C[It is  a pity to let W have this move while attacking. B loses a lot of potential for reduction..  However, a B play at 'a' is probably sufficent compensation.]
WL[174];B[oh]BL[83];W[oi]LB[ok:a][on:b][lg:c]C[This looks heavy as B is probably going to get out. How about sidestepping the issue with a move at 'a'.  this threatens both 'b' and 'c' and B cannot defend both.]

LB[np:a][lf:b]C[Q: I felt I needed to make sure my eyeless group could get away.

This group is in no great anger although making good shape at this stage wil l certainly help it.  However, you need to do it in sente so that you are the first to play around 'a'.  To this end I would try a move at 'b', threatening to make a territoy in the center.]
BL[6];W[ef]LB[dg:a]C['a' look like better shape]WL[119];B[mk]
LB[lp:a]C[Q: Now I hope to harass the white groups on the right and lower left.

I think this is too ambitious as the group to te right is as good as alive.  If you want to attack the bottom you need more patience - try a wait and see attitude with 'a'.]
BL[587];W[nl]WL[108];B[ml]C[Unnecessary. You are forcing W toward the bottom where you hope to make territory,]
BL[538];W[nm]WL[67];B[mm]BL[483];W[mn]WL[54];B[nn]C[Unreasonable.]
BL[472];W[on]WL[42];B[no]C[Q: I'm a bit worried about the lower left corner, but since the white group on the left is weak, I think I will be ok  (in that I should be able to at least get something for the corner if I lose it).

The white group may be weak, but it is unlikely to die so you cannot afford to be too generous in the corner.  B57,59 and 61 were overplays.]
BL[461];W[mo]WL[34];B[pl]LB[po:a]C[You cannot expect anything like this to work until your own stones are stronger.  How will you answer Wa?]

WL[579];B[pn]C[But it did!.  W let you get away with too much.]

C[Q: I thought this was a good move for white.  I was looking at a move at 'a' to possibly kill the group.

'a' would not kill the group, because Wb threatens to cut and so give W enough room to live.  However, this W76 is a big move, all be it gote.]
WL[465];B[ho]LB[jm:a][im:b][fr:c][nr:d][fh:e]C[Q: Now if I can escape I should be in the lead.

On the contrary.  Now if you can escape you may loose the game.  Count the territories. If you force with each of 'a'-'d'  W ends up with less than 25 points at the bottom.  The 4 forcing moves alone are worth about 15 pts. After them you can play around 'e' and take a big center.  If, on the other hand, you try to run with B5 you the fight may spill over into your territory and you may lose it all.]
BL[235];W[fn]LB[im:a]C[What is this? 'a' is probably simple enough and doesn't let B out so easily.]
