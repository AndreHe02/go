AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Jeff: Hi! Handicapped games aren't my best, but we'll see what we can do with it. I'll be posting my comments with my first name like this. I'll have some overall comments at the end. Remember I'm also learning so my moves aren't going to be the best, but hopefully they will be helpful suggestions to help you improve.]
;W[ec]C[moshes [23k\]: hi, good luck]
(;B[ed]C[Jeff: Not sure if you were worried about something specific here, but I'll give a variation that secures the corner and gives some nice prospects for territory.]
;W[fc];B[fd];W[gc]C[Jeff: As a general rule pushing from behind like this is considered bad.]

(;B[jd]
(;W[gd]
(;B[dg]C[Jeff: Variation accomplished the same idea.];W[fe]
;B[df];W[ee];B[de];W[ff]C[Jeff: This empty triangle is bad and can be exploited.]

(;B[jp]TR[ff][fe][ee]C[Jeff: Good point, but I feel cutting the marked stones is bigger.]
;W[he]C[Jeff: Now it's connected and protected.];B[md];W[id]
;B[jc];W[ic]
(;B[ie]C[moshes: This was obviously an error, I think I should have played J18 instead.
Jeff: Perhaps not. J18 is gote (you must make the last play). See variations.]
;W[je]C[moshes: I realized that I could extend out (J14) but I was concerned about his getting into the corner so I chose to back down instead.
Jeff: Sometimes keeping the other player disconnected is the best option. By sacrificing J15, white has one completely connected shape on the board while you have two disconnected chunks.]

(;B[ke];W[if];B[jf];W[ie]
(;B[kf]C[moshes: This I think was overly cautious, I should have gone to K13 instead.
Jeff: Both accomplish the same task, but K13 is better.];W[jb]
;B[kb];W[ia]C[moshes: now I should have protected at M17.  :(
Jeff: Yes, it appears that way in hindsight. Although there might have been a complicated way to win (I can't come up with it without forcing white to make a mistake).]

(;B[mg]C[Jeff: This stone feels kind of sloppy. See two alternatives.]
;W[kc]
(;B[kd];W[lc];B[mc];W[lb];B[mb];W[ka];B[dc];W[db];B[cb];W[ea]
C[moshes: now I should have gone to C19 I think.
Jeff: C19 can be considered endgame. There are many bigger points.]

(;B[eh]C[Jeff: May be kind of slow. You have strength in this area, so a knights move can be made.]
;W[ca];B[bb];W[ba];B[aa]C[moshes: obvious error, I should have gone to A18, then A19 is no one's point.
Jeff: Right, which would have resulted in very little change in score overall.]

(;B[bd];W[ab];B[bc];W[aa];B[dm];W[ld];B[le];W[jg];B[kg];W[jh]
;B[kh];W[ji];B[ki]C[Jeff: Again, think about the pushing from behind. It gives white a good wall and white is always one step ahead (can cap you are any time and make you bend back on yourself -- see variation).]

(;W[ma];B[na];W[la];B[nb];W[oq]
(;B[op]C[Jeff: I feel like the two variations are better.];W[nq]

;W[mk];B[mj];W[lk]
(;B[lj];W[kk];B[gp]C[moshes: I think that instead of playing here now I should have pressed white at M5 or 6.
Jeff: Yes, but my variations give even stronger results. The idea is the same though. Black has enough stones, he should always put pressure on in a handicap game.]
;W[kj]
(;B[li]C[Jeff: Perhaps unnecessary.];W[qe]

;B[nh];W[of];B[ng];W[nf];B[mf];W[ne];B[nd]C[moshes: I think I handled this attack reasonably well.  There may have been better moves but I didn't make most of my usual mistakes and as a result he didn't get away with much of his attack.  I'd be happy to see suggestions for how to have done better, though.
Jeff: It was good. White was grabbing at straws here, and as long as your moves kept you alive, white was dead.]

;W[gh];B[cq];W[ei];B[di];W[fg]C[moshes: now I see it.  I knew an opportunity to cut him was coming, but I missed it during the game.  I think that now I should have gone to H10.  Let's see...
Jeff: There are too many "if's" here. If white made no mistakes I think not much would have been gained.]

(;B[sc];W[sd];B[oe]C[Jeff: Another wasted move. What could white have done here?]

(;B[bl]C[Jeff: Typically touching stones will make them stronger. So don't touch when defending.]

(;B[ar]C[moshes: I wanted to protect myself without making an empty triangle.  This was the only place I could think of.  I'm not sure whether A3 would have been better. but I thought it might have allowed him to sneak out and make another eye.
Jeff: In this case the empty triangle was probably ok. (Every rule has its exceptions, typically in the corners)]

[ks][rs][ss]C[moshes [22k\]: thank you for the game
Jeff: So this turned out well. The biggest thing to work on is probably on making quicker bigger moves in the beginning. And learning when you need to and don't need to protect cutting points (so you can make better moves elsewhere!). Good luck. Hope this was helpful.
