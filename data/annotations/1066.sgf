C[(Note to Reviewer- I am currently a 21k on IGS and a 12k on NNGS.   I have also made of few note intthis file of where I think I went wrong. I would appreciate any additional insight and corrections you may have.   However,  I am most interested in those areas which I messed up and did not not realize it. :-)  If you have comments regarding the other player (white) I will be glad to send him a copy of your final review.)
no2k (reviewer): It was a nice game. I enjoyed reviewing it.  I think you both played very well, but you both have to play more solidly. This means that simple connecting/strechting moves do the trick. Hanes are only good  a) at the end of a string of your own stones, there where you are strong, or  b) when you have to develop quickly and you are willing to give up some stones.
I hope the commentary is understandable and makes this clear. At last black lost 14 points in the endgame, so the game was fairly close.]

(;B[go]C[I felt that this was a mistake as it left me open to attack; however, I also wanted to get some influence in in the bottum right above the fourth line.
no2k: This is a mistake. The knight's move is too thin. espacially because of the whole at E3. So it can be cut easily. One normal move is at F2 (see var)]

;W[mp];B[lo];W[mo];B[mn]LB[in:A][lq:B]TR[go][gp]C[no2k: I don't see any good reason behind this move. I think a move around A would be good. (Strengthen your weak stones.) Or a move at B to keep the groups separated.]
;W[lq];B[ln]C[n];W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[no2k: This is the wrong direction. On the side where you play, you will get strength, while white will live in the corner. So you must decide how much worth is the resulting strength. In this case you look into safely connected white stones. If you cut on the other side your strength will look into free territory. (see var)]

;B[ro];W[pm]C[no2k: too ambitious.];B[pn]C[no2k: Good move. Now you have no defects in your wall, and the too white stones are looking very lonely.]
;W[qm];B[qn]C[no2k: Not necessary];W[pk]
(;B[ok]C[no2k: Remember: a crosscut helps to get a resilient shape. You are strong here. So make a stromg wall. (see var)]

LB[oj:A]C[no2k: This move had to be at A. This is the decisive move of the game. If you let white connect his two weak goups, your strength has accomplished nothing. If you had played at A, white cannot connect. Remember that a solid connection is often the best alternative. An open connection leaves always a weakness.]

[hh:B][in:C]C[no2k: that seems to be self murder. If you wnt to use this stone as a ladder breaker it should be at a. From there it is possible to flee. But i think better moves are at B or C.
B is a normal reducing move. It is placed exactly on the surrounding line of white's moyo.
