C[Hi, my name is Johanna Tuominen and I'm EGF 2 kyu from Finland. I added some comments and variations to your game, hope they help.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[qd];B[eq];W[cj];B[jq];W[qn];B[qj]
(;W[ql]LB[qg:A]TR[qd]C[JT: This is move that I consider bad. First it does not make enough eye space for white, and second it forces black to expand towards white upper right corner. That is too the direction where white would like to play. Black is happy to play to A because it prevents white to expand the marked corner stone. I added some Joseki variations, which I think would be better in this situation. See the variations from previous node.]
;B[qg]
(;W[rk];B[od];W[pc];B[pd];W[oc];B[qc]C[JT: In this case I would have considered some other possibilities. Not that the one chosen in the came isn't possible but I would have consider variations, which work better with the upper left corner and side. See the variations.]

(;W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[nc];W[qa];B[qe];W[rd];B[nb]C[JT: This sequence seals white into corner and gives black influence towards the left corner and side where white has potential territory. I would also consider some other variations. See the variations from node 17.]
;W[pb];B[fc];W[cf];B[jc];W[kd];B[kc];W[ld];B[lc];W[lg];B[nq]
C[JT: There is an intresting cut, which would help white to make the marked stones stronger. See the variations.]

(;W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[or];B[pn];W[pm];B[rn]
C[JT: This is questionable move for black. If black is worried about these stone, one should connect these in sente for instance by playing P3.]

If black defences white can play something like J15 to secure the center. After that the upper left corner looks big.]
