 osman 3k*: on igs];B[qk]C[reid:  the white stone at q8 is light, so this move
is too small for black now.];W[hd];B[md]L[fd]C[reid: black n16 goes  against the philosophy of the chinese fuseki
a bit.  black wants white to invade so that he can chase white
around in his framework.  black n16 lets white have two plays inside
his framework, so it let's him off the hook a bit.  more aggressive
might be to play at f16.  nonetheless, n16 is big...];W[de];B[gc]L[fd]
[ee]C[reid: g17  seems a bit passive for black. f16 or e15
to seperate white might be more interesting.]
(;W[hc]C[reid:  white invites black to seperate his two weak stones!
the variation might be a better way to handle this...];B[gd];W[he];B[ge]
;W[hf];B[gf];W[gb]L[eh][ei][cc]C[reid: too small! and blacks response will  hurt
white's d15 stone even more!  this is a very  flexible position for white, and it's a shame to
"freeze" the shape (korigatachi) this way.  I would
prefer to see a probe at e12, e11, or c17 instead.

By the way, the strategy of sacrificing d15 in exchange
for the k16/n16 is unreasonable.  while white can harass
those stones, he can't really expect to kill them outright.
there's just too much space there for black.];B[fb];W[hb]C[
 osman 3k*: this goservant client on the mac is the best !];B[ec]L[cd]
[gh]C[
 osman 3k*: are you using that one too ?

reid: too small for black.  black should consider the
f18 stone as expendable, and play either at c16 (if he
wants to make sure he has the corner) or somewhere around
g12 to enlarge his moyo.];W[dg]L[mf][jf]C[reid:  I'll copy the following  from the last game I reviewed for
you: "Another general principal of go is the fight when you have
the advantage (and avoid fighting where you are at a disadvantage)."
in this position, it's 8 black stones to 2 white stones.  even if
white manages to live here, he probably won't gain from it.  better
to play lighter if you must play here.  better still to leave the
aji in this area for later, and take your sente somewhere else, perhaps
the top-side fight with white n14 or k14...];B[eh];W[cc];B[cd];W[ci];B[cj]
;W[eg];B[fh];W[bd];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[cb];B[bf];W[db];B[ac]C[reid: black  should leave this.  if black can kill
white, that means that white owes him a move here.
if black *can't* kill white, then he is wasting ko
threats.];W[bc];B[ab];W[ea];B[fa];W[ba];B[eb]C[reid:  four ko threats :-(]
;W[da];B[jf]C[
reid: now black reaps the harvest of white's invasion.];W[hh];B[gg];W[hg]
;B[jb]L[jh]C[reid: this black move should be at a instead.  the
area around m17 can never be big for either side, so
there is no real reason to play there.  if instead
black pushes white into his strength with a, and white
dives for eyes with k18 (or l17), white can complete his
encirclement with j10.  then black's center influence should
be enough to win.

if you look for ways to force your opponent to live small
instead of trying to kill him, you will understand a deeper
and more interesting level of go...];W[jh]C[reid:  the key point  for both sides, and white
gets it.];B[oi]L[lh]C[reid:  black abandons the field of battle!  why not
continue pressing white with something around m12?];W[lh]L[ke][lg]
C[reid: a bit better  perhaps to peep at l15, then attack
with m13.  m12 doesn't have much affect on black.];B[dn]L[ng][qg]C
[reid: go proverb: "play the urgent point, not the
big point!"  something like o13 would strengthen
black, attack white on a large scale, and would
be aiming at invading with r13.];W[mb];B[nb];W[nc];B[mc];W[lb]C[reid: simpler  just to play p18.  black still seems
to have just one eye, and the corner is now secure
for white.];B[oc];W[nd];B[od];W[ne];B[ob];W[kc];B[jc];W[me];B[ld];W[kd]

he lost sente) in this furikawari (exchange).];B[kb]C[reid: aji keshi for  black.]
;W[kf];B[fq];W[lk]L[rq]C[reid:  this move has almost no affect on  black, and
it seems to be trying to make territory with thickness.
s3 would be better if white is trying to attack the black
group on the right.  white is behind, so he needs to do
something drastic...];B[gj];W[gn];B[fm]C[reid: black can coast...];W[hq]
;B[rq];W[dr];B[cq];W[fr];B[gr]L[eq]C[reid: black doesn't need to fight here.  he can just
pull back with e3.];W[eq];B[gq];W[ep];B[hp];W[en];B[em];W[ip];B[hr];W[iq]
;B[ho];W[cr]L[go][gp][eo]C[reid: white a, black b, white c would be a serious attack!
