C[I am 10 years old and have learned Go for 2 years in Singapore. I am strong when I play with other primary students on 13x13 board. But on 19x19 board, I am  always  like driven by the opponent, and help them to get their shape. Some people said I am not aggressive anough. Please kindly help to comment and point out how should I overcome the problem.

I am black in this game.

Vindicare: Hi, my comments are preceded by a V.];B[pp];W[dd]

[qm:D][pn:E][qn:C][jp:G]C[V: I'm not too sure about this move.

These are the moves I see normally (although it doesn't mean that you have to play them)]
;W[qh]TR[ql]C[V: This extensions is too small. You can punish him for playing like this.

Any white thickness that faces these marked stones will be somewhat wasted. We won't call it thickness anymore, we call it overconcentrated.

So you want your opponent to become overconcentrated at this point.

The game go is so vast that you cannot predict what will happen. But when you are presented with opportunities like this, take all the time in the world to find a way to really punish white. You can give yourself a very nice advantage right now.]

(;B[qq]C[Is this move too conservative?

V: I think so. Why did you play the 4-4 in the first place? If you want corner territory, play a 3-4 or a 3-3.

The 4-4 means that you are willing to sacrifice corner territory to get influence (which you can use to manipulate global development in your favor).]

(;B[dm]LB[dj:A]C[Is this move correct? I feel like I should try to attack his moyo on the upper-left corner.

V: It's hard to say that it is bad, but your corner is open. If you want to play for influence, maybe you can try to go at A.]
;W[dj]
(;B[ic]C[V: This is too low.];W[cc];B[cq]C[Is it another small move?

V: No, it was small earlier, but now it's one of the biggest moves.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[jj];B[hg]C[How to attack the upper-left moyo? Is it too late now?

V: I don't think this is a good move. Your opponent didn't know how to handle it though.]

(;W[gi]C[V: White attacks you from the wrong direction, you et a second move which allows you to correct your first mistake.]

[ok:B]C[is this move helping him to build his shape?

V: You needed to defend against the cut at A, perhaps B would be a better choice.]
;W[nn]LB[jm:B][np:A]C[V: This move at A is a nice move. You should have played here earlier, but it is usefull because it's an open road into his moyo. You can also enter from the B direction. White won't get much from his moyo.]

(;B[on]C[V: This is not a good move, its and yose type move, keep it for the end.]

You certainly don't need to answer white's last move. Take sente to get a bigger move.

You need to evaluate the threat of your opponent's move and check if there are bigger moves elsewhere.]

Don't just respond to your opponent.

If white threatens to remove 10 points, then instead of responding to him (giving him sente) go threaten 10 points at some other area of the board, if he responds he's given you sente :)]

(;B[qd]C[V: I find this is a nice move. First of all, it takes corner territory, which is not small at all.

More importantly, it's a contact play. You have probably noticed that after a contact play, your opponent becomes more solid. In this case, we want the opponent to become solid because every stone he adds here makes him more overconcentrated.

You want to look for moves that accomplish 2 things at the same time.]

Notice that Black would prefer to have his stone at A. This is why A is part of the normal moves I showed earlier.]
