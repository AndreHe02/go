;B[qo];W[on]C[This result seems a bit weak for w. He gets outside influence, but lacks a solid base.

CG: I would also prefer the black position.];B[fq]C[CG: I would play R6. Permitting the bottom right corner to be separated from Q9 does not fit well to the chinese fuseki.]
;W[hq]C[This move always frustrates me. When I'm b I'm not sure how to respond. When I'm w, it never seems to work out well.]

(;W[jr]C[An incredible blunder.];B[gs];W[kq];B[hr];W[qn]C[I don't see where this move harmed me, so I tried to move against w's base and build influence to the center.

CG: This is an important move. But due to blacks serious mistake on the lower side, it does not really matter and the game is already over.]
;B[kp];W[lq];B[dn];W[eo];B[fo]C[CG: This is a very bad move.  You are pushing white against your weakest stone! You are already overconcentrated on the lower side, and your move is worth at most five points. Either F7, C4 or D9 are better, but I am not sure which is best.]
;W[en];B[ep];W[dm];B[dq]C[I figured that if he was going to *give* me the corner, that I'd take it as far as sente allowed.]
;W[cp];B[cq];W[bo]C[CG: Considering white did not have a base in the lower left, I think this exchange fovours white. Nevertheless, you are way ahead.]
;B[jd];W[nc]C[This invasion seemed ill-advised; the pincer would seem severe.

CG: This position is very difficult for white. Playing kakari from the other side may be better, but white will have be careful because his bottom right group is not fully settled yet.
Furthermore, I do not think the pincer is the most severe answer because white can settle his stones easily, and since he ends in sente, he can play either O9 or S9 afterwards.]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od]C[I'm happy to trade the corner for the wall towards my q9 stone. Is that not strong enough for my confidence?]
;W[rc]C[CG: White should play O18, taking sente (black should answer at N15 or O16), and play O9 afterwards.]
;B[rd];W[nd]C[CG: This is a bad move since it only strengthens black.]

;B[ph]C[I felt this shored up the side well in case of an invasion. Would extending to f17 be better?

CG: No, Q12 is ok.];W[hc]C[This is what I feared in not taking f17.

CG: An invasion around R11 could also have led to complications.]
;B[ic]C[CG: Just jumping at K14 is better.];W[hd];B[jf]C[I felt small on the top and so aimed to press out into the middle and then invade around c14.]
;W[lf];B[hf]C[CG: White can cut at J15 immediately.];W[nf];B[of]
;W[ng];B[df]C[Given the non-response to my cap at h14, I felt it better to take the high approach. Even if I would be cut at k15, i thought the loose wall of d14 - f14 - h14 would give me enough flexibility to live in the center.

CG: Since there is the cut at J15, your stones in the middle will have to live on their own. But I do not think this is a serious problem. But since white can cut anyway, I would rather play the low approach move since it is more territory-oriented.]

C[Cut off from the center, I wanted to ensure life.];W[gb];B[ib]
;W[fc];B[kb];W[dh]C[This seemed a bit harsh, but I thought I still had a good counter.]
;B[dj]C[CG: Leting white connect with C14 is a little submissive since white gets a lot of territory. D13 looks better.]
;W[cf];B[dg];W[cg];B[eh];W[ch];B[ei]C[I think I can live fairly easy with this group, but I'm not happy about the amount of territory w is getting on the left.]
;W[qj];B[qk]C[I saw no reason to shirk from the invasion, though the stones near o13 gave me pause.

CG: This is a difficult move.];W[pj];B[oj];W[rk];B[rl]C[CG: This might be an overplay.]
;W[rj];B[rn];W[ql];B[rm];W[ok];B[pl];W[oi];B[nj];W[pi]C[While white deliberated on this move, I figured  there was little I could do to cut off these stones without risking mine above it.

CG: Since white can connect, S8 and S6 were bad. White is back into the game now.]
;B[rh];W[oh];B[pg];W[qm];B[ol]C[With the favorable ladderI was unconcerned about developments from here.]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[nm];B[kj];W[ji]C[This splitting move shook me a bit. It puts pressure on my group immediately to the left and also threatenes me on the right.]
;B[lh];W[lg];B[jh];W[kh];B[ih]
(;W[ii]C[I thought w would connect at L11. So I started looking at ways to attack these stones.

CG: White should just connect at L11.];B[ki]C[First I'd have to cut them off.]
;W[ik];B[hi]C[Then make sure that I could live fairly easily.]
;W[jk];B[ll]C[Then move to cut off their escape routes while also hoping to connect to my lower group.]

;W[gm];B[fn];W[jo];B[jp];W[km]C[Now I'm scrambling. I've got no eyes to work with on the right and w has a nice, open shape.]
;B[lm];W[ln];B[kl];W[jm];B[jl];W[il];B[mn];W[lo]C[At this point, I begin to see the weaknesses of the w stones below and to the right.]
;B[lp];W[nq];B[im];W[in];B[kn]C[From here, I expected w k6. My L5 would force w N5. Then with g6 and j5, I start the attack on w's center group. But I'm not certain that I would out-last it on the right. while w deliberated this move, I made the decision to sacrifice the stones at q8 and o10 if necessary to capture w's center group.

CG: I am not sure, but on first sight it looks like a ko, although a very bad one for white. Maybe this is the reason he did not like k6.]

(;W[ko]C[And from here I figured that I would come out ahead in the capturing race.]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[km];W[hn];B[io]C[Taking this forces a move and also would keep the ko I expected at j7 from determining whether or not the w stones would connect.]
;W[mo];B[hl];W[hm];B[gj];W[jm];B[hk]C[Wipe out the w eyespace and ko possibility.]
;W[im];B[gk]C[Now he has 4 liberties to my 6, though he could possibly gain more by playing f7.

CG: game over];W[or];B[pr];W[rp]C[This invasion seemed unreasonable given my eye possibility on the right edge.]
;B[ro];W[rr];B[qr];W[qp];B[pp];W[rs];B[sp];W[sq];B[so];W[dl]
C[I was worried about w s3 giving him the possibility for some ko threats in that corner.]
;B[ek];W[cj]C[This progression looks good for w.];B[dk];W[ck]
C[But now I see a weakness....];B[em];W[do];B[cn];W[bm];B[bp]
;W[bn];B[co];W[sd]C[Here I think I'm ahead by about 30 points or so, due to the capture in the center.]
;B[se];W[sc];B[rf];W[sl];B[rq]C[As I said, I was worried about this. Rather than get into a possible seki with both of us having an eye, I felt it best to just kill the w stones.]

;W[cm];B[sm];C[While I think this was a reasonable game for me and I am, of course, pleased with the outcome, I can see room for improvement. My response to the w invasion at q10 seemed a weak point. Also, I think I could have exploited w's weakness on the bottom to greater effect. The w string into the center from the top-right corner also caused me problems.

Any suggestions and/or comments are welcome.])
