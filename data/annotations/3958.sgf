C[I'm black in this game.  I think it's the first time I've played an even game as black in quite a while. It was pretty close until I messed up on his invasion where I then resigned.  Thanks for reviewing!!!

(;B[bm]LB[cm:B][en:C][eo:A]C[# This is low, and allows White to restrict you to the side. There is a go proverb "jump out and then make eyes on the side". You should probably just play at A, which in addition to getting out also splits the two white stones. However B  and C are also joseki.]

C[# This move is too close to your strong ponnuki.];W[hc]C[so at the end of fuseki, I think I'm behind by quite a bit...

# We all end up behind sometimes. That's when we must decide what is necessary to win (or resign if it's hopeless).

# White has two large potential territories. The upper left formation is open at the 3-3 point, and if you invade there you are likely to make one of the extensions seem inefficient. You get to this first in the game, but I think you could play it immediately, and then turn to reducing the White's moyo on the bottom.]
;B[ic]C[# You shouldn't play contact moves without good reason. Black ends up overconcentrated in gote.]
;W[ib];B[jc];W[mn]C[# White gets to the boundary of the two moyos first. It is a big move.]

;B[mk];W[ll];B[lk];W[kk];B[kj]C[# I'm not sure this pushing helps you as much as it helps White solidify his territory.]
;W[jj];B[jk];W[kl];B[ik];W[fk];B[ij];W[ej];B[ji]C[not sure why he let me have the ponnuki...

# Pulling out the stone would have been dangerous for both sides.]
;W[im];B[jl]C[# This is an endgame move. Since White wouldn't take K8 now, it is best to save it for later or for use as a ko threat.]
;W[jm];B[dj];W[di];B[ci];W[dh];B[bi];W[bh];B[of]C[# Big move.]
;W[nd];B[md];W[nf]C[I was thinking about cutting at O15 and then try to kill the stone just played, but I decided that was probably too aggressive and would have failed.]

;B[md];W[nc]C[I was thinking about Q16 forcing either m16 or p19 allowing me to play Q15 to save the stone, but then I decided that it was just 1 stone and wasnt worth it.  My opponent later said that I let that group live too easily, but I figured that the group was going to connect to the corner no matter what I did, and there's plenty of space in the corner to get 2 eyes.

# White's group is not in danger.];B[lb];W[pd];B[cc]C[I was waiting to play this invasion and decided this was the best time.

# I think if you played it earlier you could have ended in sente (because White did not have B12). Still, it is very good that you got this point before your opponent.]

I usually have trouble killing invasions like this, but I think I played it well until the end...
