C[[tengensan\]: Hello. I have two nicks in KGS and IGS: eversonyos and tengensan. I will use "tengensan" here since I am using this nick more.
You ask for the big point and the bad move... I will try to show you some good places to play... I don't like to say "bad moves" because Go is a profund game, so I don't like to judge the moves... since I am 10k IGS and 4k KGS, there is a long way for me to go too... ^_^

   Well, let's go for the review... =)];B[pd]C[[tengensan\]: I don't know how far you know about Go, so I may say some basic concepts, but I prefer repeating them than let something escape...
  The 4-4, Hoshi, usually is played for a fast play and for influence, with "fast" I want to say "build something with less stones".]
;W[dp]LB[pp:Q4][dd:D16]C[[tengensan\]: The game is simetric... If you had played at D16 or Q4, Black could have played a diagonal fuseki, that leads to a fight game.]
;B[pp]C[[tengensan\]: Black's formation is know as Nin-ren-Sei Fuseki.]

(;W[nc]LB[nc:O17]C[[tengensan\]: Ok. I don't know why you played O17. I am not saying that this is bad, but it is difficult. I try it sometimes, and it makes the game difficult.

  There are 2 rules that, hum... let's say... "make the game easier":

1) Start playing in the corners, sides and then in the center. This has a reason. It takes less moves to survive in the corner than in the side, less to survive in the side than in the center. When you make a group alive, it becomes strong and it helps you a lot during the game, it suports you. (if you like RPG, you can associate the alive groups with White Mages from Final Fantasy... ^_^ ).

2) Make the stones help each other. I don't remember if I read it in the collection "In the Beginning" or in "Opening Theory Made Easy" from Otake Hideo. Please, see the variation, I will show you what I wanted to say.]
;B[pg]LB[pg:Q13]C[[tengensan\]: Q13 is not a joseki. I played this a lot, but I never found it in a joseki book or site...]
;W[pb];B[kc]LB[qc:R17]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer R17 because White in R17 is so good...]
;W[qc]LB[qc:R17][pg:Q13][pd:Q16]C[[tengensan\]: As I said, White R17 is very good. It is sente, if Black ignores (tenuki), White will invade in the right side and Q16 and Q13 will seem useless.]
;B[qd]LB[qh:4][ph:4][qg:3][pg:3][qf:2][pf:2][qe:1][pe:1][pd:4]
[qd:3][rd:2][sd:1]C[[tengensan\]: I learned a advice to where extend from a wall. You have to count the high of the wall, in this case, 1 (T16), 2 (S16), 3 (R16), 4 (Q16). Than you extend in the side in a distance equal to the wall's high (in the third or the fourth line).
   So the ideal place for Q13 should be Q12 or R12, this means that Q13 is near from the Black's wall, this make this group heavy (it is taking less points than it could take). Maybe because of this Q13 is not joseki (I am guessing).]
;W[lb]LB[lb:M18][rc:S17]C[[tengensan\]: Usually, the first moves are on the third or fourth line. Moves on the first and second line usually are played in the final because they earn less points.
  Instead of M18, I prefer some move on the upper left corner or S17 to strenght your group, but, as I said, take a empty corner is usually a big move.]
;B[lc]C[[tengensan\]: See, now you are under pressure. =(];W[kb]
LB[lb:M18]C[[tengensan\]: They call this "crawling in the second line"... you had to do this to help M18, but avoid this sequence because you get few points...]
;B[md]C[[tengensan\]: Notice that the Black's stones aren't making territory, but they are doing a lot of influence in the center. It's difficult to explain what is influence, but it helps you in future fights or can be converted in territory, it is like an investiment.]
;W[dd]C[[tengensan\]: Good, taking an empty corner is a big move. I think that Black is a little ahead because he has more influence and your stones in the upper right side is a little low, but you can catch up.]
;B[jb]LB[jc:K17][fq:F3]C[[tengensan\]: This leave a strong cut point at K17, so it's better to play K17. Playing on the right side or a kakari in F3 is good too.]
;W[mc]TR[kb][lb]C[[tengensan\]: You protected the White marked stones, but this gives the chance for Black to strength his group. Your headache in this part of the board started with M18, notice that you had to play many stones to help M18, but these moves are helping Black even more... u.u]
;B[kd]LB[jd:K16][jc:K17]C[[tengensan\]: K17 or K16 gives a better shape for Black.]
;W[gb]C[[tengensan\]: Again. Playing in the second line in the beginning will help you opponent.
The problem with this move (the lower moves) are:
1) Your stone can't surround many points, so it is inefficient.
2) Usually, the players build two walls, one get a wall facing the edge and the other a wall face all the board... The wall that is in direction of the center is better because it can influence and help the other groups during the game.]
;B[hc];W[gc];B[cd]LB[cd:C16]C[[tengensan\]: C16 is a joseki, but is not a commom move... at least, I don't see this very often]

(;W[ce]C[[tengensan\]: I liked your choice, you give him the corner, but took influence for the outside, this can help you to balance the game against Black's influence. See variant.]
;B[cc];W[dc]C[[tengensan\]: Now, the position is equal to a 3-3 invasion.]
;B[be]
(;W[cf]LB[bf:B14][cf:C14]C[[tengensan\]: Good. B14 is possible too (see variant), but in this case, I prefer C14 because I think that you need power to fight against Black's influence.]
;B[bf]C[[tengensan\]: Now is Black that is crawling in the second line...]
;W[bh]LB[cg:C13]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer C13 because it forces Black to stay in the second line. In this shape, try to avoid Black C13 because it usually gives headache for White.]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[nq]LB[nq:O3][cg:X][de:X][ec:X]C[[tengensan\]: You left some dangerous cut points that I marked with X. Even if Black attack, you can manage it, but it is better to avoid this.
   But your move O3 is very good, so it compensates the cutting points.]

(;B[qm]LB[np:O4]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer O4 to get more influence, see variant.]
;W[cm]LB[kp:L4][jp:K4][nq:O3][qm:R7][pp:Q4]C[[tengensan\]: I think that Q4 and R7 makes O3 a little weak, so you could help O3 with a stone near it, like K4 or L4. Your move is good too, but between the left side and the lower side, I prefer the lower side.]
;B[dq];W[eq]LB[nq:O3]C[[tengensan\]: Very good. If you forced Black to run for the rigth, O3 could become weak.]
;B[cq]
(;W[cp]LB[ep:E4]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer E4 because it confines Black in the corner and spread influence over the board, see variant.]
;B[er];W[fq];B[fr]C[[tengensan\]: The same sequence of the upper left corner...]
;W[pq]LB[gq:G3]C[[tengensan\]: Again, Black G3 is a good move, so it is good for you playing at G3 too. Remember, a good point for you opponent is a good point for you too. Playin at G3 would give you a huge influence on the left side.
  Q3 is not bad, but you can give more influence for Black. Sometimes it is ok, but in this case I am thinking: "how will White reduce Black's moyo?"...]

(;B[qq]LB[op:P4]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer P4, see variant.]
(;W[oq]LB[op:P4]C[[tengensan\]: P4 is other choice again, see variant...]
;B[gq]C[[tengensan\]: This move hurts White a lot, it destroy your influence on the left side and in the lower side.]
;W[jq]LB[qj:R10]C[[tengensan\]: Good, you reduced your loss in this area... Now, an invasion around R10 seems a good next move.]
;B[ir]LB[ir:J2][pj:Q10]C[[tengensan\]: I think that Black Q10 is bigger, J2 is on the second line and it helps you to close your territory.]
;W[jr];B[iq];W[rk]LB[rk:S9][jp:K4]C[[tengensan\]: Your feeling was good "I have to reduce Black", but a Black hane at K4 can hurt White a lote. And S9 in the second line is much low.]
;B[qi];W[rm]LB[pk:Q9]C[[tengensan\]: Good, other choice should be Q9, after it you could do a monkey jump (suberi) on the upper or on the lower side.]
;B[rn];W[ql]C[[tengensan\]: Perfect, your sequence was very good.]
;B[pm];W[ri]LB[ri:S11][qn:R6][pl:Q8]C[[tengensan\]: I thought about Q8 to explore the cutting point at R6, but your move at S11 is better because you make a base for your group, good choice.]
;B[rh]
(;W[rj]LB[qj:Q10]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer Q10 because it helps you to run to the center, see variant.]
;B[sm];W[rl]LB[pk:Q9]C[[tengensan\]: I believe that Q9 is better because it helps you to run for the center. I am not sure, but your group is almost dead.]

(;B[qo]LB[pk:Q9]C[[tengensan\]: See the variant, I think that Black Q9 kill White's group or at least, lets Black  with a good position...]
;W[sl]C[[tengensan\]: In these cases, is better run to the center, now Black can enclosure White and almost can kill it.]

(;B[ok]LB[ok:P9][qh:R12]C[[tengensan\]: See variant. R12 is the only Black's weakness that don't let him to kill White. P9 is a good move, it doesn't kill White, just threath, but it helps Black to increase  his influence and put a pressure to White group.]
;W[qj];B[ph]LB[pi:Q11]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer Q11 to block White.]
;W[pk]C[[tengensan\]: Now White is alive, but still has to reduce the Black's upper side.]
;B[oi]LB[oj:P10]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer P10, since it is stronger and closes White more.]
;W[pl]LB[jp:K4][nd:O16][pl:Q8][pj:Q10]C[[tengensan\]: White is alive because he can play Q10 or Q8 to live (this is called miai), so I think that a move like O16 or K4 is bigger]
;B[ol];W[jj]C[[tengensan\]: Rsrsrs... As you can guess, I am suspect to talk about K10. Well, but I think that Tengen is good to reduce the influence of your opponent. Since Tengen is in the center, it can run to everywhere to live. Maybe, instead of Tengen, you could have played more inside of your opponent moyo.]
;B[lh]LB[lq:M3][cg:C13][lh:M12][nd:O16]C[[tengensan\]: Black is trying to defend his moyo, but sometimes an attack value more points than a defence (you should always analise it: "which is bigger, defending here or attacking there?). I see to big point for Black to attack, M3 and C13, both of them can hurt White a lot. 
   Other reason because I don't like M12 is that this moyo is open to an attack at O16. Usually, when your moyo is open to two attacks, defending is not the best option.]
;W[hd]LB[cg:C13][jp:K4]C[[tengensan\]: Your move is good, but I believe that defending at C13 or K4 may be bigger.]
;B[ic]C[[tengensan\]: Black started playing very passive...]
;W[ig]C[[tengensan\]: ... because of it, you made a big moyo... but Black can try to fix this mistakes exploring the cutting points of your upper right group.]

(;B[de]C[[tengensan\]: Good, but I prefer C13, see variant...]
;W[df];B[ee];W[ed]LB[dc:x][dd:x][ed:x][ec:E17][fd:F16]C[[tengensan\]: This marked shape is the so called and blamed "empty triangle"... try to avoid it like the demon runs from a cross... ^_^ Sometimes you don't have choice and has to play the empty triangle, but this should be your last choice...
  In this case, E17 is or F16 is better... I prefer F16 since it defends the cutting point at G16...]
;B[fd]LB[fd:F16]C[[tengensan\]: F16 is good, it stoles your eye at E17. Always try to do this kind of move, even if you can't kill any group with it, but these moves usually are sente and make your opponent's groups heavy and weak.]
;W[ec];B[ge];W[ff]C[[tengensan\]: Nice peep... =)]
(;B[ef]LB[fe:F15]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer F15 aiming to G16... see the variant... it leads to a complicate fight, but I believe that black has advantage...]
;W[eg];B[fe];W[gf]LB[dg:D13][eh:E12]C[[tengensan\]: It seems that you decided to sacrifice your upper right group... I think that you could have save it earlier, with F16 instead of the empty triangle... But notice that D13  is a dangerous cutting point... maybe shoud be better to play at D13 or E12 if you choose to sacrifice and defend the left side...]
;B[hf]C[[tengensan\]: I think that Black D13 is bigger, now Black lets you fix the weakness of your group...]
;W[fh];B[he];W[id]C[[tengensan\]: So you didn't decide to sacrifice, rsrsrs.... ^__^
    Ok, but your group doesn't have room to live...let's remember the 3 ways to live a group... you know them, but it is good to feel it in your bones (and maybe there is someone reading this review that didn't realise it yet). So, a group lives when:
1) It has room to make two eyes;
2) It can connect to a alived group;
3) It can kill an opponent group around and, with it, make two eyes or connect to a safe group...

   Knowing this, you notice the 3 rules of an assassin *:
1) Steal the base of your opponents group, reduce the space that would let him make two eyes, when reducing, try to induce him to make the death shapes (six rabbit and so on...);
2) You can't attack with weak groups, if so, your weak groups will ending be attacked, die, and you won't kill your opponent group.
3) After 1 and 2, don't let your opponent connect to a alive group, surrond it in a direction that will be more difficult do live.

   * "somehow, it remembers me of the anime Soul Eater... the three rules of an assassin that the character Black Star always says..." ^__^]
;B[if]C[[tengensan\]: Good, Black didn't cut, because the White group is already surrounded.]

(;W[jf]LB[dg:x][hg:x][jg:x]C[[tengensan\]: No, it seems that you still has hope to kill this Black group, but, as I said, you can't kill a group with weak groups (even Sai can't do this, rsrsrs... ^.^ ).
   See variant...];B[hg]C[[tengensan\]: Now, Black can kill even more.... =O]
;W[ih]LB[hh:H12]C[[tengensan\]: I prefer H12... in this cases, it is better to sacrifice or you will lose even more... =(]
;B[hh];W[hi]
(;B[gd]C[[tengensan\]: Since White has many weakness and cutting points, Black could have went a little longer with his attack, see variant...]
;W[je];B[gh];W[gi]LB[gd:G16]C[[tengensan\]: As I did in the variant... but G16 was wasted, since Black could have used it to kill bigger... ;D]
;B[fg];W[dh]C[[tengensan\]: Good.];B[fi]LB[fi:F11][gp:G4]C[[tengensan\]: Black can use F11 to attack you somehow... because of G3, F11 is "playable"... but I didn't like this move... I prefer G4]

;B[di]
(;W[ci]LB[ch:C12]C[[tengensan\]: Oh... it was a pitty... C12 could help you... It was difficult to see this attack... it was really a pitty... see variant about C12...]

[ch:x]C[[tengensan\]: Let's try to learn something with this mistake... try to see yours mistakes as opportunities to lear something, in Go as in your life... ;D
  Usually, this kind of attack starts with the marked shaped "x", the same as the blamed empty triangle...
  Notice other thing... your two groups had 2 liberties, even when you connect at D13, it makes one group with... 2 liberties!!! See? So, conecting doesn't help...

  When you notice this "even connecting here, the number of liberties doesn't increase", you will have seen a weakness, keep this in your mind.]
;W[ch];B[dg];W[ki]C[[tengensan\]: almost... but Black can escape with ataris... u.u]

Try to stop fighting just when you were sure that your groups are safe.  I put the number of the group's liberties to help you see the strength of the groups...]

;MA[dc][ed][dd][hb][ff][ec][eb][so][gb][gc][gf][ck]C[[tengensan\]: Ok, I will give you some advices:

1) Avoid playing in the second line in the beginning... if the move is a sequence of a joseki ok, but don't try to expand your territory or moyo with a second line move.

2) Try to count the liberties of your groups and be carefull with you find groups with less than four liberties.

3) Finding groups with few liberties, you will see the cutting points too. Cutting points are points that separe your groups, letting them weak.

4) Keep in your mind that 3 rules to survive (and their opposite, the 3 rules to kill).

5) In the end, keep the sente (iniciative) and play the bigger moves first.

For the coming future...

1) Try to solve tsumegos to increase your life and dead skills, this will improve your reading skills too.

2) Besides improving your reading skills, try to read more variants during the game... but do this only when your reading becoming fast, or your games will be very long or you can lost by time.

3) Study Joseki, not memorizing, but see one, try to understand, to play it...

    And that is all, I wish you good luck in your next games and remember, more important than winning is to learn and enjoy with Go. Bye! =D]

   So, O3 and D4 can work together. Black can avoid this and choose other joseki, but it will give you other choices...

   Making your stones work together is almost like a "Combo". The ideia is: you have to make the game flow to a way that is good for you, giving you many choices and few choices to your opponent.]
