C[Thank you for review my game.
I am the Black side in this game.
I am weak in escape. Please give me more advice in this aspect.

Thanks.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[kq];W[op];B[pn]
LB[pq:A]C[Is black 9  is the best move at the moment?

Black A is playable too.];W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[ro]C[Is Black13 good or at S2 would be better?

Yes, S2 will put more pressure on the P4 group.];W[mq];B[dr]
;W[cq];B[hp];W[cj]LB[fc:A][jc:B]C[Where is the biggest move for the next move of black?

Black A to approach the corner or somewhere around B to occupy the side, both are playable.]

(;B[cc]C[Is it the correct time to invade the 33

Pls look at the variation.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb]
LB[bc:A][bb:B][bd:C]C[White should consider to play A, black B, white C to develop the side.]
;W[gb];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[ej]LB[dm:A][ie:B]C[Is Black41 good?

This move is OK, but you can play A or B too.];W[lc]C[I feel unhappy when White moved at M17.]
;B[le];W[jb];B[nn]LB[mp:A][nq:B]C[If you can exchange black A with white B, it would be better.]

;B[ne]C[Here, white is only helping black to consolidate his territory.]
;W[lh]LB[mi:A]C[White A is the correct shape here.

Black should play A to attack the whole group too.];B[qb];W[rb]
;B[pb];W[ra]LB[mi:A]C[Black A now better.];B[nh];W[ni];B[mh]
;W[mi];B[mg];W[lg];B[mf];W[kj]TR[ng]C[Black should aim to attack the whole group, you can't be satisfied just by capturing the marked stone.]

(;B[fe]C[This move is unreasonable.

Since white E17 and B15 both groups are alive, there is no cut here.]
;W[he];B[hf];W[if];B[ie]LB[hg:A]C[This cut is unreasonable, you should play A to protect yourself first.]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[ig];B[eg];W[fd];B[ee]LB[jf:A]C[This move can be omitted.

You should play A instead.];W[je];B[ck]LB[gh:A]C[Overplay again. 

When you have one weak group (without 2 eyes), it is not advisable to create a second weak group.

You should play A instead.];W[dj];B[dk];W[ek];B[fj];W[el];B[ch]
LB[dh:A][dg:B][bh:C]C[White should play A, black B then bridge under at C.]

[cg:F]C[Slow move, if black A then white J16.

Capturing 3 white stones is yose now.

White can play C, black D, white E, forcing black to play F.]
;B[bg];W[dh]C[Too late.];B[dg];W[kr];B[lr];W[lq]LB[mr:A]C[Black can play A also.]
;B[jr];W[kp];B[jq];W[mr];B[ks]LB[mo:A]C[White A is shape.];W[ln]
;B[rr]LB[mo:A]C[Black should play A first (to break the eye-shape).]

If white A then black B.

;B[qs]LB[oo:A]C[Is that the white is already dead and Black 177 is not necessary?

R1 is not the best way to kill.

P5 to fix the wall better.

If white R1 then black O2, still a bulky 5 inside.];W[ps];B[rs]
;W[gj]LB[ji:A][jh:B][ki:C][kh:D][ml:E]C[Where is the best move next?

Of course, you should play black A, white B, black C, white D then capture 3 white stones at E...]

For me, I prefer to give up this 2 black stones, since black is still leading.]

Idea is to let white capture in a smaller scale.]))
