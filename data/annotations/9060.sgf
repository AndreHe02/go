C[C: Hi, I will be reviewing this game for black as requested. I will comment on moves for both sides as we go and summarize by thoughts at the end. Enjoy!

hc12 [4k\]: hi
masaakixy [3k\]: hi];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq]C[C: I would prefer to be a little more active and approach the unbalanced corner, but it's a matter of style, nothing wrong with playing on your own side.]
;W[jp];B[fo]C[C: I would prefer to play at C6. K4 is a far pincer and the one-point jump is a little conservative in my opinion. It is not easy to turn and attack K4 as it is both far and high.]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cr]C[C: C3 is the standard move.];B[dq];W[cq]
;B[ep];W[do]C[C: White let you get away with it, you have a very nice shape with sente and K4 is now in some danger.]
;B[iq]C[C: The first questionable move. You need to attack from the other side and take advantage of the wall. Remember, you need to push your opponent towards where you are strong.]
;W[pn]C[C:  It is more natural to approach at O4 and help out the K4 stone, although white is trying to play lightly and make you overconentrated at the bottom.]
;B[nq]C[C: This move should be at O4. Remember you are on the offensive - K4 is the target and potentially Q6 depending on sente. A territory-focused move like this puts you too low on the bottom and the F3 wall is not really working now. 3rd line for territory, 4th line for power.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[rq];W[qk]C[C: White is happy with this result. Now he can sacrifice K4 if necessary without any worries.]
;B[ce];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[dd];W[bc];B[ec];W[cd];B[db];W[cc]
;B[ed];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[nc];B[ld];W[ne];B[qf];W[pb]
;B[qc];W[lb];B[hc]C[C: Again too low, you should play on the 4th line here. You can't really make much territory here because of M18 and also need to cover the weakness in your shape at E14. I would look at K16 or J16 here.]
;W[jc]C[C: The natural move, M16 is isolated.];B[jd];W[id];B[ic]
;W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[kc];W[lc];B[jb];W[kb];B[jc]C[C: White is happy with this result. The pattern I'm noticing is that you are trying to make territory from your walls by playing close extensions on the 3rd line. You need to use your walls to attack.]
;W[jf];B[kf];W[le];B[if];W[jg];B[ig];W[jh];B[ph]C[C: Opposite comment here, this should be a 2 point extension on the 3rd line at R11. White no longer has any weak groups, so you need to catch up on the territory.]
;W[jq]C[C: A little heavy from white, I would prefer K6 or L6.]
;B[ih]C[C: I understand you are worried about white taking J12, but it is better to respond on the bottom and look for sente to play J12. Now white has too easy of a time on the bottom.]

;W[kh];B[ki];W[lh];B[cl];W[bh];B[bg]C[C: Better to push at C12 directly and save this move for later.]
;W[dl]C[C: White is looking for sente.];B[ck];W[dk];B[dj];W[ej]

;B[qb]C[C: A big end-game move, I was wondering who would take it.]

;W[ef];B[df];W[fe];B[eg];W[de]C[C: The biggest point I noticed from this game is that you are trying to make territory from your walls by playing close extensions on the 3rd line. You need to use your walls to attack. You had very nice shapes on both the top and bottom, but both ended up being very small. Black traded influence for territory, but none of white's groups were in any real danger. Your endgame and life-or-death both seem good, what I'm going to recommend is that you work now on fighting. Identify the weak groups, drive them towards your walls, and not necessarily kill the groups, but see if you can make big chunks of territory while your opponent is trying to save his stones. If you really go for this, your games will be shorter at first (either your opponent resigns after losing stones or you resign when you overextend), but once you get the hang of it and balance it with your current territorial style, I think you'll gain 1-2 stones in strength.]
