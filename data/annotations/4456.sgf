C[R: Hi! My comments will be preceded by "R:" I hope you will find useful.


hi reviewer. Thanks for having a look at this game. Recently I have found myself increasingly uncomfortable as white, and playing unreasonable moves in the middle game because I always feel that I am hopelessly lagging. In this particular game, my opponent allowed these moves to pass unpunished, and let me get back in the endgame, but I still feel it gives a good example of the sweat I get into as white.
I feel there must be something I'm missing in the fuseki. Is that it? Can you tell me what *it* is?

Thanks,
Steve aka Benlaowai.];B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd]
;W[fq]TR[dd][fd]C[R: You should continue the yoseki at the upper left corner. It is said, this is the best option till a certain level ... 

Anyway, I think sometimes it is ok to explore new openings. And i'm far not strong enough to tell this move  wrong or not. So thats ok.]
;B[cm]
(;W[dr]LB[jp:A][hq:B]C[R: No need to press the corner at the triangle. W will end up in gote. You can play elsewhere (tenuki) or about A. If B plays pincer at B, W can always take the corner and be safe. (see variation)]
;B[cq]
(;W[cc]LB[cc:A][cg:C][ch:B]TR[fd]SQ[jc]C[R: If you played marked stone at the fourth line (line of influence), your immediate goal is not to make territory. This is why you dont need to deffend at A, instead you can consider counterplay by a pincer at B or even attach at C. (see var.)

If you dont like that huge black left-side, one more reason to play this way.

(However If there was a stone at K17, "A" would be nice move!)]
;B[dj];W[iq]C[Q: This is typical of my openings as white. Already I feel horribly behind. I have nothing to compare to that massive black side. At this stage I'm thinking I have to invite a deep invasion and kill it to win.
What would be a better fuseki for white?

---------

R: Its matter of taste. I dont think W is far behind. Maybe other player would say: oh, how terribly overconcentrated black it is! :-) 
Consider that for B this territory is everything! He will most likely stick to it, and answer any threat about F line. There is no flexibility in this play. 

And about the great sum: B has about 30 sure (?) points, W has about 15. W cannot be more than 15 pont behind at *worst* case.  :-)  (however he is not.) 

Anyway, if you dont want to see solid enemy territory like this, please see other variations in this sgf.]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[on];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[pl];W[qg]LB[mn:A]TR[ql]
C[Q: Is this ok? Following sequence looks a bit odd.

----

R: It looks strange to leave poor R8 on its own. Now for B it is easy to live. (In the other hand W  R13 doesnt attack B's corner strong enough.)

If you save the marked stone, and can threat black's group and any move about A will be sente while make your moyo bigger and bigger.]
;B[qi];W[pk];B[ol];W[pi];B[qh];W[ph];B[rg]
(;W[rf]C[R: Instead force to make ponnuki, W might try keep B on the second line (struggling for life is always welcome :-) and even let it to live! The great center influence worth much more]
;B[qf];W[pg];B[re];W[rh];B[sf];W[ri]TR[re][qf][sf][rg]C[Q: Is this a reasonable result?

----

R: That ponnuki is  too good for black :-/ . No, forcing B to make ponnuki at the corner in gote(!) is hardly good.]
;B[qm];W[rl];B[rm];W[qk];B[kp];W[nc]C[R:Good one. Thats big.]
;B[pc];W[jd]LB[kc:A][ne:B]C[R: maybe  a bit too far and single purpose. If W wants to build territory, its better to make base at A (please note black's strength in the area). However W could jump towards the other group at B (closing black corner and extending moyo).
If Black invades,  W can chase the weak stone with pleasure. (please note, W has already a weak stone at the bottom side!)]
;B[lc];W[ld];B[kd];W[kc]
(;B[md];W[ke];B[mc];W[nd]C[Q: this move was based on the idea that I could split black, but I misread. How to play here, if reading based on actual reality?
---

R: I think there is no way to cut here (without beeing cutted of course). Maybe it is better to sacrifice the stone inside and close in the corner.]
;B[me];W[oe];B[ne];W[od];B[of];W[pf];B[pe];W[nf];B[mf]
(;W[ng]TR[of]C[R: It's better to capture than simply pull out.]
;B[nb]C[Q: This is the move I overlooked when trying to keep black split. Too blind...

R: Thats ok. W cannot get everything.];W[og];B[ob]C[Sente a big gift.

R: if W capture the P14 stone before, it would be sente for W anyway. So B only gave back the gift :-)]
;W[lq];B[kq]
(;W[mo]TR[jo]C[Q: Thought a long time about this move. Still not really happy with it. Any obvious alternatives for leaning on black's weak group?

---

R: Nice idea to separate B. Well, if there were obvious alternative, i'm sure you would have made that move. 

You might try a faster N6, but i dont hink it is possible to catch that black group in this position. Too many way to flee.

So that, I would try to prepare my attack with some moves (extending uppers side moyo would be nice) and when nowhere to hide, unleash the attack!]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[io];W[fo];B[im];W[eg]C[R: This is big! Very good move.]
;B[dg]
(;W[ef];B[ij];W[dh];B[ch];W[cj]TR[dm]C[Q: This very nearly went horribly wrong. Was I just lucky, or was this really a workable idea? (I can't tell!) If this doesn't work, is something like f7 a reasonable substitute?

R: Looks desperate. Black D9 would finish off that stone. W can press down black's position around triangle if (s)he likes.]

;B[cn];W[do];B[co]LB[dm:A][ep:B]C[Q: I was pretty happy with this result. Black's big framework held to the 3rd line, (well, more or less with d7 & e4 still open) But is this really justified? Probably not... comments?

R: "A" is double atari. "B" is bad aji :-(
If W wants to press down the left side, start with pressing, not with invading.]

;W[cr];B[br]C[black's last few moves seem very submissive but I have played this way myself... is there a better way?]
;W[bq];B[bp];W[dq];B[cp];W[il]LB[kj:B][kr:A]C[Q: unduly optimistic move #2. Where would you have played in this situation? What are the most important priorities on the board at the moment?

R: Endgame moves. 
Descend at A would be huge for Black. 

Playing at  B is also worth a try, (as support for your incoming cut or getting some territory in the center)]
;B[jl];W[jm];B[jn]

(;W[hj]TR[fj][kj]C[Q: Reasonable?

R: its trickier to precede with something like L10. (and get some profit)

However F10 is weak, W should save it.];B[gj];W[hi];B[gi]TR[kj]
C[Terrible result?


R: White still can use that stones to make some profit in the center ... (but that was unneccessary)]

(;W[lp]TR[kr]C[R: L2 would be great double-threat for black. Better to deffend low.]

cheers!

R: Black had some opportunites missed, but completely destroy? No. This was a good game. I think you underestimate playing lightly and overestimate building territory in fuseki. 

I was concentrating some josekies in the fuseki, i hope it will help!
