C[TJ: This is the first game I played after getting promoted to 2k* on dashn.com, the fairly new Korean server. I am also 2k* on IGS, but if my first few games at this level on dashn are anything to go by, I would say the dashn ranks are even tougher. I got badly beaten up, but I can only find a couple of dubious moves--it was one of those horrible games in which one feels absolutely helpless, as though armed with only a pea-shooter against a tank. I guess everybody feels like this when they play against stronger players, but even so it is hard not to feel frustrated!]
;B[dq];W[de];B[pp]LB[cn:A][dc:B]C[I have three games in my database where pro's play either A or B as black 3. So maybe it is urgent to counter the 5-4 immediatly.]

(;W[pd]C[TJ: I think I might have been better off approaching at d5 to develop my stone at d15. If Black takes the top right with his next move, I could counter by getting ahead in the lower left.

MP: I think both ways are possible, but you might be correct that the lower left is more consistent with 5-4.]
;B[dj]C[TJ: This seems good to me, making it difficult to develop d15 as I would have liked.]
;W[dc];B[jd]C[If you have trouble finding a good attack then playing elsewhere can be a good strategy. Later, depending on how your opponent moves, you can adjust and choose an attack that feels good.
See K3 as an example too make the game balanced.]
(;W[hd]TR[dc][de]C[TJ: This, I believe, was my first mistake. Shouldn't I have attacked from the other direction?

MP: I agree. Since the marked stones are strong it not logical to attack from this direction.]
;B[mc];W[oc]
(;B[ic];W[hc]C[TJ: This is my second mistake. I'm aiming at L17, but the shape in the top left looks overconcentrated, and black's stones are already quite dificult to attack anyway. I wish I had played Q14 to finish off the shape in the top right -- that would have given me potential territory in the corner and would have supported an attack on the top had it been viable later.

MP: I do not agree. H17 is essential. If there was a mistake it was H16. The exchange J17 for H17 is not good for black.  L17 is a severe defect.]
;B[qf]C[TJ: This kind of move is extremely common on dashn, since everybody there seems ultra-territorial. But here this move seems just right as well as very territorial, punishing me for not playing q14 last move.

MP: But black is creating another weak group close to his only weakness.]
;W[pf];B[qe];W[pe];B[pg]
(;W[og]C[MP: Forcing black to make territory cannot be good.]
;B[oh]C[Good move by black.];W[ph];B[qg]
(;W[nh]C[TJ: I now say this move is an absolute lemon. My idea was to try and build thickness with which to attack on the top, but it just gives black easy territory on the side and does not give me a good shape in any case :-( To my simple mind, q11 now seems a lot better, since black will have to take time out to settle his r13 group before thinking about cutting at p14, and the top would also still not be settled.]
;B[oi];W[ni]TR[ph]C[TJ: Durr! I'm pushing the cart from behind _and_ I have to go back to repair a cutting point and then my shape is still vulnerable.

MP: If you connect instead. Black will have to worry about the marked stone. This move simply forces black to solve his only local problem.]
;B[pi]TR[ni]C[Yes this is terrible. This is the same shape that you could expect from extending to O13 immediatly. Instead of thickness you have played the marked stone which havevery little effect on black.]
;W[ng]C[TJ: I have a weakness at o15 which causes me some grief later.]
;B[nb]TR[ic][mc][jd][pg][qe][qf]C[MP: White have built thickness but it will not be to any use if black defends here. Loosing the initiative is often the effect when you attack too early.  
Black had two weak groups but white mad one of these groups strong and lost sente.

Still O18 is not a good point since white have no territory in the corner yet.]
;W[kc]C[TJ: I try my best, but he outguns me easily, which is not surprising given the weak point at O15.]

(;B[me];W[nd];B[lc];W[lf]C[TJ: I could not cut because the ladder does not work.]
;B[le];W[of]C[TJ: This is what happens when you makes a couple of errors against a stronger player -- you get mercilessly twisted into a comical kind of shape!

MP: It had been better to connect like this immediately. Now black is slightly thicker.]
;B[kf];W[kh];B[jg];W[if]C[TJ: This is surely too close to be much good as an attacking move.

MP: Right. If Black simply move out in the center this move just leaves bad aji behind.]

[mg:B]C[TJ: I like this move a lot. It looks slow, but it not only makes the top virtually impregnable, but it also takes a liberty away from the h15 group, which later frustrates an attempt to capture the g13 string.

MP: True this move make A and B miai for life.
If white got the chance this would be the point for killing black.]

MP: The difference in strength between you and me is not big enough for me to notice all of your mistakes. But I think this is what have to be careful about:

You often attack for no good reason. In almost every situation where you could play atari you did so. In such situations you should always consider extending your weak stones first.

If you defend then you can attack without hesitation. In many positions you cannot attack strongly and then you do something else until an opportunity presents it self.

In this game Black several times got into trouble because of greedyness so if black ever sees this game record then this is my advice: Not every stone on the board is worth capturing.]
