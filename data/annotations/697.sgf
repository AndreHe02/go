AB[pp][dd][pd][dp]C[Comments by Erik Ekholm,  Swedish 2 dan.
October 1998.];W[db]C[Highly unorthodox, but okay, it is a  handicap game.]
WL[44];B[fd]LB[cc:a]C[Hard to know how to answer.  This is probably fine; Black got a high move in exchange for a painfully low  move. 'a' later will attack White strongly and make his stone heavy.]
BL[48];W[qn]WL[39];B[np]BL[42];W[fq]WL[36];B[hq]TR[dd][fd]LB[dn:a]
C[The two marked stones make the left  side big, so I would play 'a' instead. The book "Handicap Go" warns against  playing narrow pincers (like H3) without preparation.]
BL[37];W[fo]WL[33];B[dn]BL[34];W[lq]WL[32];B[lp]BL[14];W[kp]
WL[30];B[mq]LB[qq:a][lo:b]C[This move tries to  take territory in the corner, but it is open at 'a', so the shape move 'b',  which makes influence, is probably preferrable.]
BL[11];W[lo]WL[29];B[mp]BL[9];W[kq]WL[27];B[qo]LB[ho:a][pj:b]
[qj:c]C[Black is too concerned with taking territory early. The  right attitude in a handicap game is to attack.

I would be tempted to move out at 'a' to split White in two, but it may  become too complicated for Black in a 4 stone game. 'b' or 'c' which attack  R6 from a distance, and are also extensions from Q16, can't be bad.]
BL[3];W[pn]LB[qj:a][nn:b]C[Black's problem now is that 'a' and 'b' have  become miai for White.]
WL[23];B[nn]BL[1];W[cl]LB[qj:a]C[White should take the ideal point at 'a'.]
WL[8];B[fm]LB[em:a][ho:b]C[Too thin. 'a' is the usual shape. After that, black 'b' would  be a serious threat.]
BL[475];W[em]WL[475];B[en]BL[470];W[fn]WL[473];B[dm]BL[468]
;W[el]WL[472];B[dl]BL[466];W[ek]WL[470];B[ck]LB[dk:a][ej:b]
[ci:c]C[a-b-c looks better.]BL[463];W[gm]LB[cq:a][cj:b]C[White got very thick in the centre, while 'a' and 'b' remain  weak points for Black.]
WL[452];B[dq]C[Big, but only territory.  This move has no strategical value as it doesn't reinforce a weak black group  or threaten a weak white one.]
BL[458];W[qf]LB[pj:a]C[Black could  play 'a' now and simultaneously attack the heavy group below and pincering  the stone above.]
WL[445];B[nc]BL[452];W[pj]C[Ideal  formation for White on the right. I feel White is gaining too fast for  comfort.]
WL[439];B[nl]LB[cc:a]C[Not urgent since White would  need more than one more move here to encircle Black. If Black's corner had  been a lot weaker, it would have been a good move.

'a' would be big territorially and also attack D18 strongly.]
BL[449];W[mm]WL[435];B[nm]BL[445];W[ro]WL[428];B[rp]BL[440]
;W[cj]WL[424];B[bk]BL[433];W[lc]WL[414];B[ic]LB[rd:a][qh:b]
TR[lc][qf][pj][pd][nc]C[Black must watch out so that his corner doesn't get  into trouble. White has three stones against two (marked) and the next move  as well. I would play 'a', which protects the group well, takes points and  aims to invade at 'b' later, which would be  severe backed up by Black's thickness around O8.]
BL[424];W[rd]WL[412];B[qc]C[Good, taking the vital 3-3 point.]
BL[421];W[rc]WL[410];B[rb]TR[lc]LB[ne:a]C[At this stage,  there are so few points left in the corner to argue about, that I would play  'a' instead, which is another way of helping the weak Black group, that has  the added value that it attacks the white stone at the top.]
BL[419];W[sb]WL[404];B[qb]BL[413];W[of]WL[400];B[pl]LB[ne:a]
C[Getting out around 'a' is more urgent.]BL[406];W[ql]WL[397]
;B[qk]BL[400];W[pk]WL[396];B[qm]BL[396];W[rl]WL[395];B[rm]C[Good!]
BL[389];W[pm]WL[392];B[rn]BL[377];W[ol]C[As  it turned out however, Black retained sente so that he can get back to the  top.]
WL[391];B[me]BL[370];W[nd]C[Too impatient, White  should strengthen M17 before trying this.]
WL[361];B[mc]BL[354];W[md]WL[359];B[ld]BL[349];W[ne]WL[353]

(;B[od]C[Not needed if Black plays like the variation.]BL[341]
;W[kd]WL[349];B[cc]LB[le:a]C[What!? You can't leave  the fight around M16 now. You MUST play 'a' to keep White M17 separated from  the rest. This is the biggest blunder in this game, since the timing to play  C17 is the worst thinkable. :-(]
BL[332];W[lb]WL[345];B[qd]BL[469];W[qe]WL[478];B[mb]LB[ob:a]
C['a' would be safer; it looks like the vital point.]BL[464]
;W[ob]WL[454];B[oc]BL[428];W[pb]WL[452];B[la]BL[425];W[jb]WL[443]
;B[ra]BL[391];W[gc]C[Now  this game looks very difficult for Black to win.]
WL[431];B[gd]BL[382];W[hc]WL[428];B[fc]BL[371];W[fb]WL[424]
;B[hd]BL[368];W[ib]WL[406];B[jd]LB[dj:a]C[Not a threat as White is alive on both sides anyway. Black should  probably play at 'a'.]
BL[358];W[ec]WL[399];B[kc]BL[351];W[le]WL[390];B[kb]BL[348]
;W[ed]WL[374];B[ee]BL[344];W[de]WL[368];B[dc]BL[327];W[eb]WL[367]
;B[df]BL[323];W[ce]WL[365];B[cf]BL[314];W[be]WL[342];B[bf]BL[264]
;W[bc]C[Now it is clear that White has won. The territories are  roughly equal, but White is thicker in the centre (and higher ranked), so he  is the one who can expect to get more points from here on.

Generally, Black would benefit from thinking more in terms of weak groups,  and try to find moves which does not only take points, but also protect his  own weak groups or attack his opponent's weak ones. Good luck! :-)
