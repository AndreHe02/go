;B[pd]C[The reason B lost this game is not to be found in some error in grand strategy. Rather, it is a case of a mistake here and a mistake there and before you know it the game looks really bad. 

So the review does not have a brilliant theme either; rather, it consists of down-to-earth explanations of the mistakes. (jantje)]

 trouble (j)];B[ci];W[dh]C[The last exchange is very negative for B. The black group on the side remains cramped, and the two White stones C12-D12 are strong and well placed with respect to the upper left corner.

The B move is OK, you really have to keep W separated. Keeping sente if
 possible, because the upper left corner might grow too big for W (j)]

more than it does B.  (j)];W[fh];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[dc]

 low at K17.  (j)];B[mc]C[Better at M17 --it might even be sente-- (j)]
;W[po]C[Do you notice how B is late in every transaction? Low approach may be even better for W, makes it harder to do something meaningful with the B stone at Q3. (j)]

;W[rr];B[or];W[nr];B[nq];W[np];B[ns];W[mr];B[rs]LB[bo:A]C[A nice trick to achieve ko.
The fact that you had this aji left makes S6 not such a bad move after 
all.
However, the outcome of the ko will show that you had to go A first. (j)]

debt at the left side; so the ko was unwinnable. (j)];W[qs]
