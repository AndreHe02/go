C[Remarks for Reviewer:
I am from Hong Kong, China. Therefore, if you know Chinese, you can feel free to use Chinese. Thank you very much.

C: I won this game, but I think I still have many wrong moves, so I put this for review, anyway.

C: for Comment
Q: for Question
A: for Answer

Hi, I am from Spain so I dont speak Chinese at all and my English is not very good also. My level is about 4k at igs and kgs so dont take anything I tell you for sure.

Anyway, feel free to ask anything you want.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp]
;W[dd];B[oq];W[qn]C[C: When W6 came, I just considering whether I should play R9 or Q10.
Finally, I did Q10 because I would like to take the outward influence.

Q: Am I right, or having any other great moves?

A: R6 is a bad move by white because it is way too near to black corner enclosure.

Both R9 and Q10 are great moves attacking white, so it is just a matter of style. Probably I would have played Q10 myself.]
;B[pj];W[qj]C[C: I was thinking about attacking at R8 or played R11 for defense. But I chose attack at R8 instead, because I didn't want white to get the territory so easily.

Q: I think R8 is quite risky,
because when white play knight's move my stone on R8 will be isolated. Is there any better move?

A: When your opponent plays a move like R10, I only think about two moves, R11 or R9. Look at the variations]

(;B[ql];W[rl];B[rk]C[Q: Is this bad move? How can I save stone on S9?

A: You should not be worried about saving every stone you put on the board. But every stone should have a meaning to be played.

I think that you played s9 to cut off s8 stone from r10 stone. If that was your intention, you should have continue it with r9 later.

Anyway I would have played from the other side at s7 cutting off r6 and taking a big corner.]
;W[rm];B[ro]C[C: At this point, I have thought about R9, but I didn't want white to make eye, so I did S5, and let upper two stone die.

Q: Should I just play R9, to save those stones, or leaving that alone to capture other big points?

A: I have read in a GO book that irresolution is a vice. If you wanted to take a big point, why not take it before?.

In this position, at most of the times, separating enemy groups is a must so I would have played s5 at r9  instead.]
;W[qk]C[A: Dont you think white position on the side is now much better than black? So Black instead of attacking has helped White to live and that is not a good way to win at go ยก]
;B[pi];W[pl];B[jp];W[rj]C[A: I would have extended to r11.]
;B[jd];W[jq]C[A: Again the same move by White. This is a quite tricky move but it is only good as a last option to invade a big moyo.]
;B[kq];W[kp]C[A: There is a go proverb that says" When in a cross cut, extend" It is not always easy to choose what side extend but lets see some variations again.]

(;B[lp]C[A: I think some of the variations are better than this atari]
;W[ko];B[iq];W[jr];B[kr];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[gq];W[lo];B[mp]
;W[mo]C[C: I was worrying about the right lower corner was being blocked, therefore I played O5 to find outlet, but I mis-calculated the M3.

Q: Can I save those two stones and get outlet?

A: I think there is no way to save the bottom and get to the center. I would have played at 04

Anyway, White has two weak groups now while black is quite strong, so there is no need to worry about being shut in the corner.]

(;B[no];W[np]C[A: When you hane, be always ready for the cut ยก]
;B[op];W[lq];B[mq];W[lr];B[mr];W[ls];B[ms];W[ks];B[nn];W[ho]
C[C: Because urgently want to make a way out for right lower corner, hence letting white to play initiative move to pressure my black stones.

Q: Is my O6 played wrong?

A: As I have pointed out before, you should have not to fear to be shut because you were safe. It is better to have a way out to the center, but this time I think it was bigger to play at the bottom left, say e3, then f5 or so.

O6 was neither necessary nor keep the iniciative.];B[io];W[in]
;B[go];W[jo];B[hp]C[Q: Should I stick those two stones together?]
;W[ip];B[gn];W[fp];B[gp];W[er];B[en];W[dn];B[dm];W[cn];B[eo]
;W[do];B[cj]C[C: After playing this, I started worrying the place at E7, but white didn't play on that.

Q: Should I extend one more step before making two space extension?]

(;W[cm];B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[ck];B[fc]
(;W[bj]C[C: I think white should play D10 instead.

Q: If so, how can I respond to this move?

A: True, again White didnt cut where he should.];B[ci];W[bi]
;B[hl];W[hm];B[gm];W[hn]C[A: H6 is very very small for White. He is alive so He should play at any big point like c14, c12,r17, o17, k8 or so]
;B[il];W[jm];B[jl];W[lm];B[nl];W[nm];B[om];W[mm];B[pm];W[qm]
;B[ok]C[C: By playing this, I have decided to sacrifice those two stone to get the outward influences, because when it is my burden for saving them.

Q: Am I right, or those two stones can be saved?

A: You were very right. Two stones are only 4 pt. Your move is much bigger. But I would have played at c14]
;W[pn];B[lj];W[ml];B[mk];W[ol];B[nk];W[on];B[ii];W[ej]C[C: I got headache when this move. Because I think this move is aiming at cutting my connection, but I just want to kill that white stone, so I played E11.

Q: Is this move too risky, or having other great move?

A: Right now you have tha game almost won. You have many more territory and You dont have any weak group to attack.

E10 is a raw peep. A play close to a cutting point. It is usually bad.]

(;B[ei]C[A: This is a very good move in this position. You are stronger and White is weaker and cut off from other stones. Well done ยก :)]
;W[fk]C[C: I think this is white's bad move. Instead, I would play F11.

Q: Am I right? How can I respond to this?

A: I think it is bad because it is still into your territory without running and He has no room to make two eyes.

Probably He was thinking about cutting later at g8. If you have read the continuation of the cut, dont worry]
;B[gj];W[gl]
(;B[fl];W[gk];B[fj];W[ch]C[A: This is where He should have played from the beginning.]
;B[di];W[el];B[fm];W[fo];B[hk];W[fq];B[gr];W[fr];B[qg];W[rg]
;B[rf]C[Q: Is S12 better?

A: Definetively not. You should think about defending the corner and s14 is the proper move for that. Think this way. What side of s13 do you want to get? the upper side, s15-s19 or the lower side, just s12-s10? With s14 you get the upper side and with s12 the lower side.]
;W[rh]C[C: I cannot see the weak point at R14 when I was playing.

Q: Can R14 save the right upper corner?

A: yes, R14 or R15 should save the corner and thus are very big moves]
;B[ph];W[qf]C[Q: How can I protect my right upper corner to compensate my previous mistake?

A: now you must evaluate what is bigger, the corner or the center territory. Look at the variations.]

(;B[re];W[qd];B[rd];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[qa];B[nb];W[rc]
;B[db]C[A: Not a very bad move, but I would have played at f15 closing the center which is huge and letting open the posibility of invading the corner at c17 later if White dont defend.]
;W[sf];B[cc];W[ec];B[eb];W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ee];B[fd]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[gh]C[C: Now, dragon killing started.

A: Looking at the whole board now, it is clear that if Black close the center, Black win easily. So why take risks?.

I think that playing at H13 is enough. Black would win by more than 30 pts.]

;B[jh];W[ig];B[hf];W[if];B[ie];W[hd];B[gd];W[id];B[ic]C[A: I would have played at k17. J17 gives White two cutting points, k15 and k17 that is usually bad.]
;W[je];B[hc];W[kd];B[jc];W[kc];B[jf];W[he];B[ie];W[jg];B[kf]
;W[kg]C[A: Here, I would have defended at k11 or l11 because White cant kill your l14 stones so you have him separated.]
;B[lf];W[lg];B[ef];W[dg];B[ed];W[de];B[df];W[cf];B[dc]C[Q: Should I keep chasing white instead of playing this?

A: absolutely yes. Especially taking e17 was innecesary and very small.

When in a fight, and more over in a big fight like this, it is bad to play away. You give two moves in a row to your opponent.]

C[Q: What is you overall opion about this game?

A: This has been a game between two players with a very different style. White is a very aggresive while Black dont like to fight and prefer to play more territory oriented moves.

You should try to improve at fighting and about direction of play. You have not made any really bad mistake and the questions and comments you have put into this game, shows that you notice the important points, even when you dont play it well on the game. Also it make me think that you take go quite seriously so I feel confident that you will improve quickly.

White has played too much aggresive when He didnt need it, but failed at the moments when He should have attacked. He should improve very much his strategic thinking and territory awareness.

I would like to repeat that I am only 4k, so many of my comments would not be the best but it is the way I see it. Please, feel free to ask anything you want to.]

White has been very aggresive so far, so I dont know why he didnt cut at e7. It was a very good point for him.]
