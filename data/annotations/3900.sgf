C[Hello

I think , in this game we both played quite good - without obvious tactical mistakes.
What we want to know - how good was our strategy, and what should we learn and improve.

Thanks in advance!

Good! Since this is one your better games, my critical comments will likely give you new ideas and help you take your game to the next level.
The opening was somewhat unusual and open to some criticism, but both players ended up with playable positions. B then ends up with strong side positions that he can expand into the center. W needs to think about ways to keep B from becoming so strong and to more effectively take some of the center for himself. Both players make a number of small and even useless moves, but these are more crucial for w than b.

Mark    fess on IGS];B[qf]C[
This is an unusual move to start the game, being so far from the corner.]
;W[pp];B[qm];W[nq];B[pj];W[eq];B[cq]LB[cp:A][do:B]C[
This is unusual to the point of not being too good.  A or B would be better in that they give black more freedom of movement. W's stone is keeping b from extending along the bottom and with the game move he is not well positioned to extend along the left side either.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[co];B[dq]LB[bo:A]C[
B is reaping the consequences of his cramped first move. A move at A might avoid the ko, but is awfully low.]
;W[bo];B[ap];W[ep];B[jq]LB[er:A]C[I've got plan about not let white to get bottm side

A reasonable goal, but the life of your corner is not secure yet. A might be better.]

The ko.];B[dp];W[do];B[cs];W[bn]TR[eo][fq]C[
This is a bad move. It forces b to do what he wants to do anyway and gains w nothing. Far better to play in the upper left or something to fix one of the triangle cutting points.]
;B[as];W[fo];B[gr];W[fq]LB[gq:A]TR[fo]C[
A is better. It attack's b, gives more eyespace, and is quite secure given the triangle stone.]
;B[mr];W[dd];B[fc];W[dc];B[nc];W[qc]LB[dg:A][cf:B][jc:C]C[My opponent decided to take every corner on the board ;)

Why not? I see now the basis for the question about sides vs corners. I will say that w's placement in the upper right is cramped. The usual advice for opening is corners first, then sides, then center. This is for efficient use of stones. I would suggest that w has at least as much value for his 2 stones in the lower right as black has for his 3 on the bottom or for the 2 in the upper left vs. the 3 on the right. Overall, the game seems close to even in my judgement at this point. Subsequently w plays in a manner that helps b solidify his sides and he never exploits the influence of his lower left. W might be better to do so now with a move like A or B or possibly invaade the top at C.]

C[
W has helped b solidify his bottom with this sequence. Contact moves with the enemy stones generally have that effect. Rather than push on b from the side, w should invade at say, A-C or press from above at say, D-F]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[bf];W[be];B[bk]C[Left side also should not be taken by white

This is a good sequence for b.];W[bl];B[bi];W[qn];B[rn];W[ro]
;B[rm];W[po]LB[pn:A]C[
B's next move shows how much better A would be.];B[pn];W[qo]
;B[on]C[
W started this sequence, but it is a bad result for him. Now w's corner is fairly big but confined while b's right side is expanding greatly.]
;W[qe];B[rf];W[re];B[pd];W[pc];B[pe];W[qq]C[
This is really a wasted move. W's corner is big enough to live without this move.]

;B[gb];W[jj]LB[ip:A][io:B][dj:C][ck:D]C[
W's idea that is time to go to the center is right, but just jumping out there like this is not so good. W should extend the influence from his lower left by attacking either the bottom or left side with moves like A-D. After building a bigger wall and confining b he will be more likely to get real territory in the center.]
;B[ck];W[df];B[dh];W[mq];B[lr];W[lq];B[kr];W[gq];B[ir];W[hr]
;B[hq];W[gs];B[ks]LB[hp:A][jn:B]C[
b has at least 1 sure eye here and probably 2. If he jumps out into the center with this group he will be able to pick up another and keep w from getting much there. A would be a conservative move. Something like B would be bold.]

;W[jr];B[kq];W[kp];B[js]LB[mn:A][mj:B][ff:C][kh:D][jg:E]C[
This is not needed yet B should expand one of his moyo's by something like A-E.]
;W[io]LB[gm:A][gl:B]C[
This is a small move. W should capture on a large scale with A or B to work with the center stone.]
;B[rj]C[
This point is too deep in b's territory to be an invasion point for w.]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[dg];B[ch];W[pm];B[pl]LB[om:A]C[
B is strong enough here that he can capture w's stone with A.]
;W[om];B[mj]C[
Good! B is the first to play a big move in the center.];W[nn]
;B[ol];W[oo];B[nl]LB[ml:A][gf:B][jg:C][kh:D]C[
There are bigger moves. Even A is bigger and almost perfectly secure. B-D would be much better. B's positions on the side are strong and he can really step out there.]
;W[ll]C[
Unforunately for w, b has poked his head out on both sides of w's lower position. W will not get much territory in the center any more.]
;B[hl];W[fi];B[eg]C[
Not sure why b play this.];W[eh];B[ei];W[fh];B[ef];W[de];B[ej]
;W[mm];B[he]LB[gf:A]C[
A is better.];W[jm];B[hi];W[ff];B[gg]LB[ee:A]C[
This is OK, but b can really capture the w stones after playing A.]

Again B can capture with A];W[hg];B[ig];W[gh];B[jh];W[kc]C[I think that white can't live there, but white had different point of view
