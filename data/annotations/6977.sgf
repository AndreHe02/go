AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi! I'm Jepper. Thank you for teaching me. I wrote some questions in the form of comments throughout this file.
I would especially like some insight into the middle game including the transition from the opening.
Peter: Hi, I´m a 3. Kyu and I hope, I can give you some hints to improve your Go.]
;W[ce];B[ed]C[How was this move?
Peter: Very good.];W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[Is this the correct response given Black 2?
Peter: This move is o.k. But I prefer to attack the white stone from the other side. This take advantage of the black stone in the lower left corner (see variations).]
;W[fq];B[dn]LB[cn:A]TR[ce]C[Peter: Because of the low marked white stone, I prefer A instead of Black 6.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[iq]
(;B[cc]LB[ch:A]TR[dn]C[Given the circumstances, how was Black 10?
Peter: I think, this move is to much territory orientated. Early territory is a burden, because you always have to defend this points. While attacking your territory, your opponent is able to play in an active style an can force you into his own game. Besides. if you only play territory orientated moves, your opponent need not to worry about his own stones and he feel free to attack yours.
Your opponent neither answer o17 nor e16. If you have sente, you should use it, to attack one of them. I prefer A, because the marked stone stands on the fourth line. The attack from this side helps you to close the left side (see variation).]
;W[gc]LB[ch:A]C[Peter: I think: a white overplay. An extension on the left side is necessary (A for example).]
;B[df]C[Peter: Very good.];W[cf];B[dg];W[ch]C[What are the disadvantages and advantages of this sequence for Black?
Peter: This sequence is good for Black and the consequence of the White overplay g17 and the right response of Black d14.]

(;B[fc]TR[cc][df][dg]C[Black 16 and 18 overplay?
Peter: B16 is too passive! What do you worry about? Attack the lonely white stone from the other side to take the initiative! (see variation).
You can sacrifice the marked stones, if you get such nice influence like in the variations.]
;W[jc];B[gd]C[Peter: Because of B16, B18 is the right continuation.]
;W[hd]
(;B[re]TR[gc][jc][hd][ce][cf][ch]C[Was strengthening this corner a good idea?
Peter: No it wasn´t: the two black stones are out of danger. But there are two weak white groups - attack them to take the initiative.]
;W[ge]C[Peter: Very important point.];B[fd];W[qn];B[nq];W[rp]
;B[qq];W[qe];B[qd];W[rf];B[rd];W[pl];B[pj]C[It felt as though Black needed to invade. Where should Black have played? Or was Black 32 correct?
Peter: Yes, Black needs to invade and B32 looks as the very right point.]
;W[of];B[nj]LB[mf:B][nl:A]TR[gc][jc][hd][ge][qe][of][qf][rf]
C[How do you feel about Black 34 and 36?
Peter: B34 is the very right move. It splits the two white groups on the right edge. But because White A secure the lower right group, you should attack  the upper right group by separating it from the white group on the upper edge with B instead of B36.]
;W[nl];B[ql]
(;W[pk]LB[pm:A]C[Peter: White should play at A (see variation).]
;B[qk]
(;W[qj]LB[pn:A]C[How should Black play here?
Peter: The White cut seems to be a overplay. Black can live on the edge and leave White with the cut-aji at A (see variations).]

(;B[qi];W[rj]LB[mf:A]C[Was it good for Black to give up 36 and 38?
Peter: I think, that´s also possible, but compared to the situation, if you immediately attack at A, you first secure White in the lower right.]
;B[ph];W[qm];B[ri];W[rl]
(;B[nh]LB[mf:A]TR[nj][pj]C[How do you feel about Black 46?
Peter: I you have a look at the moves W74 etc., you will see, that you doesn´t get any eyeshape. You can sacrifice the 2 marked stones, because White already live in the lower right. Attack at A (see variation).]
;W[mf]C[Peter: too late!];B[og]LB[lc:A][lh:C][cj:B]C[Peter: No value. Very slowly. Perhaps A instead or tenuki and B. If you worry about your own stones, play C immediately, but this helps White to connect his own stones.]
;W[oe];B[lh];W[oj]
(;B[pi]LB[lc:A][pj:B]C[Peter: Because White already live in the lower right,  B hasn´t any value. Play A (see variation).]
;W[md];B[mc]C[Was Black 54 the best response or was there a bigger or more urgent point elsewhere?
Peter: Because it´s sente for both sides, B54 is a good move (it´s a pity, that it was played very late).]
;W[ld];B[he]LB[cj:A]C[Are there better moves for Black besides this cut?
Peter: Now White is connected, the local battle is over. The cut is to small. Black A is very big, and as long as the White group in the upper left is in danger, the Black group in the upper left corner is saved.]
;W[hc];B[hf];W[cl]LB[cj:A][cm:B]TR[dn][dp][cq]C[Should Black have secured this area earlier?
Peter: Have a look at the comment about B10.
Black at B is very submissive. Don´t look one-sided after securing your own territory. After W63 the White group is saved and he gain much more territory as it is entitled to him. The White extension is one point too far, so I prefer to attack at A. The marked Black stones are strong - don´t worry about them. If you will win, you have to fight. You can´t win, if you already evade the fight.]
;B[cm]C[Was the following sequence the correct answer to White 59?]
;W[dl];B[cr];W[dh]
(;B[eh]LB[lc:A][kq:B]TR[hf]SQ[cr]C[Was there a bigger or more urgent point elsewhere?
Peter: Play A: because of the triangle stone, the white group is in danger (see variation).
B is a  second choice: White didn´t answer the rectangle stone, so B puts hard pressure on the White group.]
;W[de];B[ee]LB[ff:A]C[Peter: A is correct shape instead of B66.]
;W[ei];B[fh];W[bc]
(;B[cd]LB[bb:A]C[Peter: Better at A. Don´t fear the cut (see variation).]
;W[bd];B[cb];W[ok]LB[kg:A]C[How do you feel about the sequence from White 73 to Black 80?
Peter: You can´t get two eyes, so you should connect with A immediately.]
;B[oi];W[mi];B[lj];W[mj];B[mh];W[mk];B[li];W[kf]C[Was White 81 necessary here?
Peter: See variation to move B64.];B[kq]C[How do you feel about the timing of Black 82?
Peter: It´s a big point (see comment B64), but, it´s a pity - now the two Black groups are separate instead the two white groups. It´s the result of your defensive play.]
;W[jh]LB[jg:A]C[Is there a better way to attack Black's group on the right?
Peter: First White have to separate the two Black groups. W83 seems to work well, but because of  the possible cut (see 2. variation to move B86), perhaps White A is better (I'm not sure).]
;B[jj];W[hh]C[How do you feel about the sequence from White 85 to White 97?
Peter: see next move.]
(;B[cg]LB[fi:A]C[Peter: Because of the follow until W93, play A immediately and see, what happens (see variation).]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[bf];B[di];W[ci];B[fi];W[dj];B[hj]C[This move and the moves leading up to it seem to end terribly for Black. What should Black have done?
Peter: Look at variation to B96.];W[gj]LB[hi:A]C[Peter: Play at A (see variation).]

(;B[gi];W[hi]LB[gg:A][kg:G][ij:D][ek:F][hk:C][il:E][kl:B]C[Peter: you can´t hope to connect your both groups, so I prefer to secure first the left one with A. After that it can´t be helped, you have to run with your other group: 
If White D, Black B.
if White B, Black C (threats to capture one white stone with F, if white continue with E)
For later there is your threat to cut wih G.];B[gk]C[How should Black have played in this case?

Peter: I think, you can live without this move, but you have to sacrifice wether the triangle or the rectangle stones.
I would try, to attack the white stones at the bottom, but now it´s difficult, because of the cut at A and heavy black group on the right.]

;W[mn];B[ko];W[en]TR[gk][ik][hl][il]C[How do you feel about the sequence from White 129 to Black 140?
Peter: If the area around the mared black stones becomes white territorry, the game is over and you can resign immediately. So I would try to ignore W129 and fight with Black A (see variations).]

(;B[dm]LB[bl:A][eo:B]C[Peter: bad shape, see W133 and 135.

;W[ab];B[od]LB[fa:C][bl:A][mm:B][io:F][ep:G][hp:E][ip:D]C[How do you feel about the rest of the game from this point on?
Peter: First you should play sente-moves like B, C, D (and after White E - F) and G and after that A is the biggest move.
Don´t play moves like B208 (W211 not necessary), B220 (simply q13, don´t try to cut a bambus-style)
After W141 the game was over.
My piece of advise: Play in a more active (mark you: not aggressive) style, also against stronger opponents. In connection with your solid style, you wil get stronger.]
