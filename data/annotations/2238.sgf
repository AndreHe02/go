AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[I was black and I may have won this game, if i had not loose my central group. I think i found a way to do so (see variation) but i'm not certain.  Moreover, i have a feeling that i played too soft a fuseki and i let my opponent get too much territory on the right side.
Any further comments welcome !
Thank you


<tomjk>Dear JVD,
I hope my comments will be useful. I will preceed them with <tomjk>
I made a summary at the end of the file.];W[qn];B[np];W[on]
LB[pj:A][qk:C][qp:B][jq:E][lq:D]C[<tomjk> This move from White looks like an overplay, White should have played at "C". Now Black can attack from above at "A", denying white an extension towards this side and extending from his center stone and the stone at Q16.

If Black wants to defend the corner he would play at "B", but this is a little small right now, as White can still play at "D". So if Black wants to defend the lower side a move at "E" looks better. Still "A" looks best here.]
;B[dj]C[<tomjk> This is not good. Black should not play elsewhere, as the situation in the lower right corner is still not settled.]
;W[lq]C[<tomjk> White gets the chance to pressure Black.]
(;B[mq]LB[mo:A]C[<tomjk> not good. Black should play at "A" (see variation), making an effort to separate the two white groups.]
;W[lp]C[<tomjk> White gets stronger...]
(;B[qq]C[<tomjk> better to get out into the center than to live small (see variation).]
;W[oq]C[<tomjk> seems to early now. Good endgame move or during middle game when Black is all walled in.]
;B[op];W[mr];B[nq];W[or]LB[nr:A]C[<tomjk> this is a mistake, White should play  at "A".]
;B[nr]C[<tomjk> good. This punishes White for his error and captures the corner big. Black suddenly comes out well here. :)]
;W[pg]LB[qf:B][pi:A]C[<tomjk> this looks a little bit too far from the two marked stones and not near enough to the Q16 stone to put pressure on it. Black could play a pincer at around "A" since he has a strong wall on the bottom to fight with. See variation.
I would prefer to play white "B".]
(;B[nd]LB[qf:B][pi:A]C[<tomjk> This is a little bit too cautious. "A" looks better, or at least "B" to threaten White.]
;W[ng]LB[qd:D][pi:A][nj:B][oj:C][mn:F][ip:E]C[<tomjk> White reinforces. Now playing at "A" is not easy anymore. Black could safely play at around "B" or "C" to reduce White's prospective territory. Also closing the corner at "D" could be an option now (in order to not fall behind in territory.
Another good attacking move would be at around "E", which later threatens the cut at "F".]
;B[kc]LB[jc:A]C[<tomjk> better at "A" if you want to play here. The actual move is not doing anything towards the black stone at D16.]
;W[fp];B[dn]C[<tomjk> looks ok.];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cr]C[<tomjk> good.]
;W[dl]LB[hq:A]C[<tomjk> Seems an overplay, White needs first to reinforce the lower side. If not Black can play at "A" for example. See also variations.]

(;B[cm]LB[fn:A][hq:B]C[<tomjk>"A" with the threat of an invasion at "B" looks more promising. See previous variations for "B".]
;W[cl]LB[fl:A][fn:B][hq:C]C[<tomjk> This looks too "heavy". White should play "light" here (i.e. play at "A"). If after the actual move Black plays at "B" (which threatens "C"), then it is difficult for White to decide which side to defend.
If after white "A!", black "B" then white can defend the lower side and still has room to manoeuver for this two stones on the left side.]
;B[cj]LB[fn:A][hq:B]C[<tomjk> again "A", aiming at "B" would be better.]
;W[co]
(;B[bo]LB[do:A]C[<tomjk> "A" is better. See variation.];W[cn]
;B[bn];W[dm];B[do];W[bm]
(;B[cp]LB[fn:A]C[<tomjk> no need to play here. See variation. "A" is better now.]
;W[fm]C[<tomjk> White takes again a key point :(];B[cm]C[<tomjk> too small to be played right now right now.]
;W[cn]C[<tomjk> also too small. Black is lucky that White responds here.]
;B[co]LB[cc:A][qd:B]C[<tomjk> much too small. Just playing "A" or "B". would be much better for example.]
;W[dr]LB[cc:C][qd:D][hq:A][fs:B]C[<tomjk> White secures against the invasion at "A" (much more difficult that before) and a possible slide at "B". Big move, but a little bit slow for 5 handicap game. If before Black "C" and now Black "D" then White would have a hard time to win.]
;B[nj]C[<tomjk> good!];W[lg]LB[pj:A]C[<tomjk> White should probably try to secure first his group with a move at "A". Black is still open in the upper corners and also the upper side looks vulnerable, so there is time to reinforce here.]
;B[mn]LB[jo:A]C[<tomjk> good! Now a move at "A" is threatening to White. Also separates the white groups.]
;W[kn]TR[lg][ng][pg][on][qn]C[<tomjk> White defends his lower territory. This is huge now! Black must try to get now territory in chasing the two weak groups (marked stones) or will lose the game.]
;B[nn]LB[pj:A]C[<tomjk> too slow. Black must not be afraid. His stone can conenct to the corner or to the center stones. "A" looks better (separate the two weak white groups.]
;W[pl]C[<tomjk> White stabilizes. Now things look difficult for Black. White has nearly caught up the difference with the 5 handicap stones (considering that the two top corners can be still invaded, so Black does not get much there).]
;B[om];W[pm];B[oo]LB[pj:A]C[<tomjk> too small. "A" is a must now. Keep the white stones separated!]
;W[pj]C[<tomjk> Whtie takes again a key point.];B[ol]LB[cc:B]
[qd:A]C[<tomjk> this does nothing to White and does not gain points for Black. "A" or "B" would be at least big territory-wise. "A" looks more urgent now, because White got strong locally and can now think of invading this corner.]
;W[ok];B[nk];W[jl]LB[qc:A]C[<tomjk> not so big. Invasion at "A" looks very big now.]
;B[hn]C[<tomjk> good Idea, but Black should have tried an invasion much earlier.]
;W[fn];B[hl]C[<tomjk> good];W[hm];B[im];W[gm];B[il]C[<tomjk> good]
;W[in];B[jn];W[io];B[jm];W[jo];B[km]C[<tomjk> good! Black uses his wall to secure some territory in the center.  Only that it is White's turn now to take the next big point.]
;W[qc]C[<tomjk> good! Seems the biggest point to me on the board now.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qb];W[qe];B[rb];W[jg]LB[cc:A][hc:B]C[<tomjK> White should maybe directly invade the other corner and then advance here.]
;B[fc]C[<tomjk> good idea. Only that White can still invade at 3-3 and get away with it. So maybe "A" was better (with the two stones on the left side to work with.]
;W[cc]C[<tomjk> here comes the invasion ...];B[cd];W[bd];B[be]
;W[bc];B[cf];W[eb]C[<tomjk> standard for Whtie to live. Note the last white move which assures life here.]
;B[dc];W[db];B[ec];W[fb];B[gb];W[gc];B[hc];W[gd];B[hb]
(;W[ge]LB[hd:A]C[<tomjk> "A" looks better (see also variation).]

;B[hh];W[ig]
(;B[ch]LB[eg:B][dh:A]C[<tomjk> good. Could also be at  "A" to take more territory and remove the weakness at "B". See variation.]

(;B[gh]LB[ii:A]TR[ef][eg][ei][fj][gj][hj][fk]C[<tomjk> no need to defend here. Better at "A" now. This would capture all white marked stones and assure victory for Black. :)]
;W[ii]C[<tomjk> White gets the key point again, too bad.];B[ih]
;W[ji];B[jh];W[kh]LB[ki:A]C[<tomjk> this looks like an error. Should be at "A".]

(;B[ij]LB[ki:A]C[<tomjk> At "A" would capture the white stones (see variation).]
;W[hi];B[ki]TR[ef][eg][ei][hi][ii][ji][fj][gj][hj][fk]C[<tomjk> good. Now all marked white stones are captured. Black should win now.]
;W[lm]C[Kenar [8k\]: and you played to soft in fuseki]
(;B[kk]LB[kj:A]C[<tomjk> "A" looks better - then White can't play the sequence as in the actual game. See variation.

I have looked at you variation. But I think just playing here at "A" is sufficient to win the game :)]

[as][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[<tomjk> an interesting game. Too bad that Black missed the right connection during the fight in the center in order to win the game.
Black played well during fighting, but missed too often the key points when a local fight was over and so came behind to White.
White had no trouble to get into the lead, but made some big overplays which luckily where not punished by Black, so White could win :)]
