C[CB> Hello. So you're playing black in this game.];B[pd]C[decker [11k\]: evening]

(;B[rl]C[CB> this approach of a stone on the third line is not often very good]

(;W[qi];B[qg];W[cf];B[df]C[CB> this joseki will let white reinforce himself in front of his D4 stone so it's not appropriate here]

(;W[ce]C[CB> white should hane first - see var];B[cd];W[ch]
;B[dg]C[CB> good]
(;W[cg]C[Aki [16k\]: Sorry I am taking so long, I'm trying to thoroughly analyze my moves. I need to improve.]

(;B[hf]C[decker [11k\]: no hurry at akk, i like to take my time as well most times..

CB> this move is a bit floating in the air - it leaves the top side open and doesn't really protect the weakness at D15]
;W[jd]
(;B[ld]C[CB> you should attack low, on one side or the other - otherwise white can play moves like M17]

;W[gb];B[jq]C[CB> you take sente - good];W[ff]
(;B[gf]TR[he][hf]SQ[ge]C[CB> that's a bad shape: "empty triangle" - it means your H14 stone doesn't do anything]

(;B[rg];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[pa];W[pg]

(;B[qf]C[CB> yet another empty triangle...];W[lk];B[ph]C[CB> good, but you should prepare your attack with a move like M14 to help your stones in the center]
;W[og];B[oh];W[ng];B[nh];W[mg];B[pj];W[le]C[CB> white is very happy to be able to play here. What you should retain from this game is to strengthen yourself before attacking.]

ifgytio: You did very well for 16k Aki
Aki [16k\]: Still
decker [11k\]: exactly
Aki [16k\]: 20 points is a lot to lose by
ifgytio: It was the middle game end where you crumbled down at the top
ifgytio: You were leading until that point
Aki [16k\]: I will need to study this game.
decker [11k\]: shoulders up :) thank you it was a good game
Aki [16k\]: Thank you for the game.
ifgytio: After O19 mistake the only hope to win was for white to mislook possible N6 or E6
ifgytio: But it was a good game
decker [11k\]: cheerio
ifgytio: I rarely see this well played games below 10k
Aki [16k\]: Thanks. I enjoyed, although struggling to live up top was rough
Aki [16k\]: Well, can't be dan in a month, eh? lol
ifgytio: As for white i think working on the opening of the game would boost you up really well]
