C[dear reviewer, i lose this game because of 2 big mistake i made...
it was move 206 n 230...
i do wonder, is there another mistake?
if yes, please point that out
thanks...

[J\]: Hi, my name is Jorik Mandemaker and I've reviewed this game for both sides. I have marked my comments with a [J\]. Be sure to configure your SGF editor to show variations so you can see the variations I've added.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[op];B[dc];W[pn]
(;B[pq]TR[op]C[[J\]: This move is not good. The marked white stone is already on the vital point of the black kosumi. It's better to attach under (see the variation).]
;W[oq]C[[J\]: Good, seal Black in.];B[cf];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[qe]
(;W[rf]C[[J\]: Atari at P14 is usual.]
(;B[re]C[[J\]: Black should extend at P14 instead.]
(;W[qh]TR[qg]C[[J\]: White should still play the atari. After this move there is no possible cut at the triangle any more so black might not answer the atari later.]
;B[hc]C[[J\]: A very unbalanced extension. It would be better to extend at or around K16.]
(;W[qk]C[[J\]: The right side is not very interesting. This move doesn't secure that much territory since black can still slide to S6. The white group in the center right is also quite safe so the extension is also not needed for defense.

The bottom and left are the biggest areas to play. White can help the right side by sealing Black in too rather than play at R9. See the variations.]
;B[cn]C[[J\]: Good.]
(;W[cl]C[[J\]: I don't like the low pincer very much. Black can jump out and push it into an akward position. See the variation. 

A high pincer (at D8 or D9) would be lighter and a better idea here.]
(;B[fq]
(;W[eo]C[[J\]: With the pincer in place the common move is D6.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ci]C[[J\] Compare this result with the result that happens when black jumps into the corner instead.]
(;B[dh]
(;W[bg]C[[J\]: The opening is no place for second line moves.]
;B[bf];W[kq];B[iq];W[em]
(;B[hh];W[lc]C[[J\]: Good, You have to get in now.];B[nc]
(;W[jb]C[[J\]: There is no reason to play on the second line.]
;B[jd]C[[J\]: A good way to take advantage of white's low play.]
;W[le];B[kf]
(;W[mf]TR[kf]C[[J\]: With the marked stone in place the kosumi is bad shape.]
;B[of]C[[J\]: Good keep White seperated.];W[mh];B[nh];W[ng]
(;B[ki]
(;W[fh]C[[J\]: White risks creating two weak groups like this.]
(;B[ej];W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[dg];W[gi]
(;B[gk];W[hj]
(;B[gj]TR[hh]C[[J\]: This move hurts the marked black stone. There is a better way to fix the cut.]
;W[hi];B[il];W[jj]
(;B[kk]C[[J\]: This has little chance of keeping white contained.]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[kj];B[gg]
(;W[fg];B[ff];W[gf];B[hf];W[ef];B[fe];W[eg];B[ee];W[df];B[de]
;W[cg]
(;B[li]C[[J\]: This move accomplishes very little at this moment.]
;W[ni];B[jo];W[lo];B[go]
(;W[gm]C[[J\]: This leaves a serious weakness and Black takes advantage of it. But it's not so important to play here right now. There are way bigger points on the board. The lower right for example.]
;B[fn];W[fm];B[en];W[dn];B[dm];W[dl];B[cm];W[do];B[bl];W[bk]
;B[bm];W[ek];B[bo];W[bp];B[bq];W[ao];B[an];W[ap]
(;B[ak]C[[J\]: Black should play C5 and he'll win outright. See the variation.]
;W[al]C[[J\]: Black C5 now still kills everything.];B[am];W[bj]
;B[fo];W[co];B[ep];W[bn];B[bh];W[al];B[ch];W[gh];B[fi]
(;W[hk]C[[J\]: I would just capture the black stone.];B[hl]
;W[gl];B[hg];W[ro]C[[J\]: Very big, good.];B[qo];W[qn];B[rp]
;W[rn];B[or];W[nr]
(;B[qr]C[[J\]: Simple connection is better.];W[rq]C[[J\]: This move loses points if you don't actually kill black. So before you play it be sure you can kill otherwise the hane play the endgame at T4 at a later point.]
;B[sp];W[os]
(;B[rr];W[pr];B[qq];W[ml];B[lj]C[[J\]: Why play here? There's no points to be gained here. J18 and K2 are big points. As is hane at T14.]
;W[ga];B[ld];W[md];B[kd];W[mc];B[kc];W[kb]
(;B[ib]TR[hc]C[[J\]: This is rarely a good way to stop a monkey jump. With the marked stone in place attachment on top is usual.]
;W[ia];B[fa]C[[J\]: At this point Black will have to fall back to F18.]
;W[fb]
(;B[ja];W[ka];B[eb];W[ec];B[db];W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[hb];W[ha]
;B[fc];W[gc];B[fd];W[gb];B[gd];W[ja];B[oh]C[[J\]: It's way to late to play around here. Trying to save the stone only looses points.]

;W[ho];B[hp];W[na];B[ii];W[ji];B[jh];W[lh]C[fa: this was my biggest mistake, i don't realize the danger of j10 n j9 since i'm already got the impression that e10 n g9 group already dead

[J\]: These are not the mistakes you should worry about too much. Just practise your reading and you'll make them less and less. There is little to actually learn from mistakes like this, just accept that you made a mistake and continue with the game.]
