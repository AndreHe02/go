C[Maere> As you will see, I was pretty much slaughtered. I shouldn't have played white, it was a result of innacurate KGS ranking. I was behind after a few moves, and fell further behind in the middle game. Although I lost so badly, I'm not sure where I made bad moves. Any comments are welcome. Thanks a lot for reviewing.


It's the first that i comment a game without the player. Please could you tell me if you're satisfy, if it's enough understable. 

If i can summarize the game here : as you didn't protect enough your group you spent your time to answer black's attacks and so you never have time to built, while black's building by attacking. you. And you missed some key points.]

(;W[mq]C[Should I have protected the corner instead?

I think that's the  way. If you don't protect your stone it will be hard. Make sure that group will live by stablize them. Im' ok with this.]

It is not the good choice because you're getting a wall but the stone in 1 seems to perturb the power of your wall.

(;W[mo]LB[ir:1]C[I hesitated with that move as well. Maybe I should have extended on the top instead?

Well. I understand your hesitation. In one side there's a big place on the top but you worry about your group.
When black came in your corner , if you've have made the good choice at first, you wouldn't hesistate because your group would have been so weak. it's a consequence of your choice before.

To answer you : if you did worry for it, playing at 1 is ente because black has to connect. then your group will have been enough strong and you could have played on the top. When you hesitate between 2 moves, try to find a move the make the oppennent answer then you can play the second move :)]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[cb];B[qh]C[here black overconcentrated his stone on the roght instead of taking the top side.]

(;W[jc]LB[bb:A]C[the idea is good : you want to take the top and to extend your group. Except that bmlack can come like in the game and hat move is a little too shy to takle the top.

[gd:B][hd:A]C[The weakness of the 3-stones-extension.

You can connect by playing at A but it gives white a ponuki that is estimated as 30 points : not good for you. 
Or a basic move is like B, but...(see variation)
Here i would choose C to protect : then if your goup in the croner is alive with that move, you can focus on you other stone.]

SQ[mb][ic][jc][lc][le]C[I think I didn't do too bad on the lower side until then, having few territory but a good base to go the center, only I wasn't sure how to go on with that strategy. That black stone greatly reduced my hopes.

what if yout tell me what hopes you had, what you were thinking of ;) i could better anwser you.

Well your low group is too open and its base too small : it's not to make a big territory. But connecting with h4 would have renforce you.
First point : If you had connected like i showed you, you would have a big wall and the black stone would have been so efficient. 
Second point : here black is threating you.  Your top group is in danger and black is starting to surround you to cut your running if you don't answer. You have to keep an eye on it. (as you did)]
;W[kj];B[gj]C[well here the priority is your top group to make it live

[eo:1][mo:2]C[Black take off your invasion point at A and in the same time makre pressure on you.
This invasion point was very important to reduce black. Maybe your last hope. 
And then black has the whole side. Your last hope is to make point in the center with your both groups in 1 and 2. But it's too open to make sure territory. lack can come easily.

Your move in B offers black to end his making points on the left side. Cause he can attack you from around C like in your game.]
