C[laver: Hi, in this match I am white.
I present you many of the thoughts I had during the match, hoping to give you some idea on what to comment about.
Anyway, I will appreciate particularly comments not related to my considerations. New ideas are the best way to impreve oneself.
I am interested in comments about both sides.

n - I general, you played well.  You eventually lost because of tactics, as you said, but your real error was at  K4 in my opinion.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq]C[laver: I am doubtful: is it better to do a san-ren-sei or to limit the influence of the shimari by playing around the right hoshi? I think those two points are miai

Ness - At this stage you can play whatever you like, it's a matter of taste.  There are a few bad moves, but many good ones.  Try different shapes, see what happens.]
;W[dj];B[jc];W[qk]C[laver: Since black does not play in either of them, I take them both...]
;B[qm];W[qh];B[qf];W[jq]C[laver: the last hoshi left...];B[fc]
;W[hc]MA[fc]C[laver: my idea is not the one of following the pincer joseki. I played this just a kikashi (forcing move), eventually.   n - This move is not very good because it makes the marked black stone strong.  You are setting yourself up for a splitting attack.  Learn joseki -- there are no kikashi at this point in the game.

The key for you to improve your opening is to learn joseki.  Take a look at the joseki tutor at http://www.turbogo.com/text/jostutor.html

Arnoud at TurboGo.com has been very generous to let us use it!]
;B[fe];W[df];B[db];W[id]C[laver: is that too early?

n - Well, you have to do something, but the position is bad for you.]
;B[jd];W[if];B[je]C[n - This is poor shape.  Black is trying to give you back the game.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[jf]C[laver: I think white is ok. Black has 2 heavy groups without base.]
;B[ie];W[he];B[cc];W[cd];B[bc];W[hb];B[hf]MA[nc]C[N - B is determined to cut, but it is bad timing.  He should just play something like X.]
;W[gf];B[hg];W[ge]MA[hf][hg]C[laver: now only the K16 group is without base...

n - K16 looks OK to me.  The weak group I see is marked.];B[kf]
C[n - B is weakening his group more.];W[ih];B[gh];W[ff];B[ef]
C[N - this move was not good for B.  He has succeeded in giving you back the game.]
;W[eg];B[ee]
(;W[fh]MA[jf][if][ih]C[laver: probably this is a doubtful move, do you agree (see variation)

N - Yes, you are encouraging him to attack your group.];B[gi]
;W[cg];B[bd];W[be];B[dc]C[laver: I think this move is really bad. I don't see any meaning in that. Am I wrong?

N - I don't think it was necessary.];W[ij];B[gk];W[kg];B[jg]
MA[lf]C[laver: I feel this like an overplay. Black is unsettled at the top, and the goup in the center is still floating. To strengthen white is not a good idea at all. I welcome this move.

N - You must not criticize your opponent's moves so much in your mind.  The more you can appreciate them, the stronger you will grow.  The best move will always work with the opponent's strengths.  This move succeeded in splitting your groups.

He should have played X.];W[ig];B[jh];W[ji];B[kh];W[lg];B[lh]
;W[mg];B[mh];W[ng];B[me]C[laver: Now black loses sente for protecting the top. White is in advantage.]
;W[nh];B[lj]C[laver: White connects. Is that a good idea? The idea is now to develop the white group in the center to do a splitting attack.

N - This is the only possible move.];W[ni];B[mj];W[il];B[gm]
;W[in];B[go];W[dm];B[hn];W[jn];B[io];W[jo];B[ip]C[N - This move is sente, you cannot ignore it.]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[im];B[jp];W[nl]LB[ll:a][kp:b]C[laver: black seems really bad. White by sure will do something on the left side, even if black is so thick. Meanwhile, the center seems to be white.
But probably I made some tactical errors...

N - You have made black very strong on the bottom, and the fight in the middle is very difficult.  I can't read it all out.  I think black should play a.

I think the game is about even at this point, or maybe black is a little ahead.  He could just play b and sacrifice the center stones to have a simpler game and still win, see var.]

(;B[nj];W[oj];B[ml]C[n - He strengthens your stone by attaching to it.]
;W[nm];B[mm];W[mn];B[nn];W[ln];B[nk];W[pl];B[ok];W[pm];B[pk]
;W[qj];B[pj];W[pi];B[ql]
(;W[qn]C[laver: This is by sure a tactical error. The correct shape is Q6 (see variation).
ButI am too weak for seeing such moves during an Internet match :((

n - It was a difficult position.];B[pn];W[on];B[om]C[laver: Anyway, very nice shot by black, who thought about 7 minutes before playing that sequence. Now it's up to decide what to do next.

N - Resign, play again another day :)

laver:
If white plays O5, black not only connect, but also gets a big chink of territory in the lower right. The match would be over. So, white prefers to continue the fighting.]
;W[po];B[ol];W[pn];B[no];W[ro];B[pp];W[kp];B[kq];W[lq];B[kr]
;W[lr];B[jr];W[lo]MA[gj]C[laver: second tremendous shape error. N4 would have been sente, while achieving the same defensive result. Now black has tons of kikashi to devastate the shape of the white dragon.

N - I think you will die either way if B plays correctly, except for the weakness at X, see comments below.]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[km];W[lm];B[kl];W[hk];B[gl];W[hj]LB[gj:a][hi:b]
C[n - Here you can push out at a.  Black must play b and you can live.  Unfortunately you still lose the game :(]
;B[gj];W[nr]C[laver: the capturing group gets captured. I hated that!!
AAAARGH! Do you see any way to save it?];B[or];W[mq];B[oo];W[ms]
C[laver: Not good, I think, since L1 is sente, threatening J3.

N - L1 doesn't make an eye.];B[kn];W[ko];B[jk];W[jj];B[kj];W[rm]
;B[rp];W[dq];B[fq];W[pc];B[oc];W[qc];B[qd];W[ob];B[nb];W[nc]
;B[od];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[qb];W[ne];B[nd]C[N - This is where he gave you the opportunity to take the game back, see variation.]

(;W[md];B[ld];W[mc];B[le];W[mf];B[ik]C[laver: At that point the match is over.   n - Yes, I'll end the review here.]
