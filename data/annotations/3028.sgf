C[SC: Greetings, I will place my initals in front of my comments. Be sure to look at the variations I have added.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[jp];W[jd]SQ[pj][dj]C[SC: This is a bit slow for white's opening.  This isn't truly bad, just a bit slow.  If white only copies black, then white is always one move behind.  I think White should take one of the side star points (marked with squares) or approach one of black's corners.]
;B[qf];W[rc]TR[nc]SQ[qi]C[SC: This is an odd way to defend the corner.  It is a fairly small move since all it does is guard the corner.  During the opening, the best moves are almost always on the 3rd or 4th line. Playing on the 2nd or 1st line is almost always too small for the opening.

In general, you want to play moves that do more than one job at the same time.  For example, playing this stone around R11 (the square) does at least two things.  It is a pincer to attack black's stone at R14.  R11 also starts to claim some of the right side for white.

Another common response would be to play this stone around O17. This helps defend the corner by making a 3x3 point invasion harder for black.  O17 also helps secure some upper side territory.

If you really want to make this corner secure this early in the game, then the 3x3 point (R17) is the best way to do this.  In general, whoever has the 3x3 point has the corner.]
;B[pi];W[qn]TR[jp][pi]SQ[qq][qk][dp][qf]C[SC: This is a deep invasion because this white stone is a long way from any other white stones.  So, white should probably expect to make life on the side and/or corner here rather than plan to run out.  Imagine a line from R14 to D4 as the border of black's area of influence.  This stone is very deep inside.  Even using a line from Q11 to K4, this stone is still deep inside.  White will have to run out past one or both of these lines to be truly "out".  Since this is such a long way, living locally is easier to accomplish.  White should plan to play one of the squares next depending on which side black blocks.

As the game plays out, this stone resulted in a weak group that remained unsettled until very late in the game.  White tried to run out but never really got out of black's area of influence. Finally, white made eyes for this group very late in the game. The invasion itself is not bad, but this move was not followed up well.]
;B[ql]C[SC:  Black blocks the side.  This means black wants to drive white into the corner rather than up the side.]

(;W[rp]C[SC: This is bad.  It is too small for making life.  Instead, jump to the 3x3 point.  See variation.]
;B[qq]SQ[lk]C[SC: Black defends the corner while also keeping pressure on white's two stones.  Now white lacks enough space to make two eyes and must run out.  White will need to get out to about M9 to be truly "out."  This will take at least three more moves.  Meanwhile, black will be strengthening his position.

Or, white could take Sente and play somewhere else.  If you have time to come back to these stones later, fine.  If not, you haven't lost much at this point by giving them up.]
;W[on]C[SC: White runs.];B[np]C[SC:  Black strengthens his position as white runs.]
;W[ol]TR[pm]SQ[qn][on]MA[mm][nl]C[SC: The three white stones marked with squares make a vulnerable shape.  Black can attack by playing at Q7 and white will end up cut apart.  The X's both mark a small knight's move jump from white's P6 stone.  Either of these moves takes white out into the center faster and avoids the vulnerable  triangle shape.]

(;B[nc]C[SC: See the variation for a black attack at Q6]
(;W[md]SQ[pc][lc]C[SC: This move implies that white will try to build outside influence while forcing black to make small life on the top side.  This is not a move designed to kill black or drive him into the center.

If you wants to drive black into the center, then play slightly away from the black stone to keep him from expanding along the side.  M17 is my first choice, although Q17 is also reasonable. I picked M17 because the top side looks bigger for white than the top right corner.  So, defend the biggest potential territory. See variation.

Planning to actually kill black is a bad idea.  Black has the option to either run out or extend either way along the side. So, black isn't in much actual danger of dying.  Trying to kill and failing is always bad.  So, unless you either have to kill to stay in the game, or you are REALLY sure you can, don't try to kill.  Instead, keep pressure on the enemy group and build strength while he merely struggles for two eyes.  So, in general, don't try to kill.  Instead try to harrass your opponent into making purely defensive moves while you gain some benefit for yourself.]
;B[lb];W[kc]SQ[jb]C[SC: K18 defends the rest of the upper side better.  K17 is also reasonable.]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[pb]
(;W[oc]SQ[nd]C[SC: This move does not fit with white's inital plan to contain black in a small area of the top side.  O16 encloses black better.]
;B[nd];W[ob];B[od];W[pc]C[unecessary thickness ?

SC: No, white needs to connect here.];B[nb];W[oa];B[nf]C[SC: Now white has around 9 points in the top right corner and black has escaped out  into the center.  This is a reasonable exchange for both players.  White also gets Sente.]
;W[cn]TR[rp][qn][on][ol]SQ[or][ri]C[SC: With Sente, white should spend some time thinking about this move.  Who is ahead at this point?  With the areas around S11 and P2, black has more secure territory.  The left side is still wide open, however.  So, white will probably want to play on the left side. Also, white has a weak group on the lower right side (triangles). You should try to avoid having more than one weak group at a time.  So, white doesn't want to create another weak group with an invasion of black's territory.  So again the left side looks best.  White's current move is actually fine. I just wanted to point out what sorts of things to consider at this point before you move.  A play around D10 is not bad as well.]
;B[co]C[SC: This is not a great move for black.  Black is attatching to a weak stone.  Contact play tends to strengthen both players. Since black is already strong here, the contact play won't strengthen him much more.  White is weak, however, so a contact play will benefit white more than black here.]
;W[ck]C[SC: This is a good extension and creates a strong base for white.]
;B[fq]C[SC: Black is trying to secure what he has already sketched out. This is reasonable when you ahead.]
;W[dg]C[SC: Now white has about as much potential territory as black. Black's territory is more secure than white's at this point, so black is still a bit ahead.  This was the last big opening move.]
;B[dn];W[cm];B[dm];W[dl];B[gm]
(;W[lo]SQ[el][jf]C[SC: This is a reasonable reducing move.  Another option is to expand your own area.  K14 would do this.  E8 combines a small expansion of your territory with a small reduction of black.

Finally, white could attack from the lower right side group. This group is still weak.  An attack from it could settle it and reduce black's territory.  However, the attack could also fail and this group could die.  This is the most daring strategy, but also has the most potential benefit.  Since black is ahead, white needs to consider fairly desperate strategies like this. See variation.]
;B[lp];W[mo];B[mp];W[ko];B[jo];W[kp]C[SC: This is a good reduction so far.]
;B[kq];W[op]C[SC: This is too far.  Presumably, white expected black to block at P3.]
;B[oo];W[oq]TR[pm]SQ[nn]C[SC:  The P4 stone is dead.  Unless you have a plan to use these stones as a sacrifice to attack black's corner, then this move is bad.  O6 connects all of white's stones in this area.  O6 even helps defend against a black cut at Q7.]
;B[po]SQ[pn]C[SC:  This move threatens to cut white at Q6.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[lq]C[not a good idea...better to play O5 1st..]
;B[no]SQ[mo][kp][ko][lo]C[SC:  This cuts white's stones apart.  The marked stones are now in danger.]
;W[jq]C[SC:  What is white trying to accomplish with this move?  White can't capture the black stone at L3, so this is just placing a dead stone inside black's territory.  Black has to respond, so it isn't a wasted move, just a useless one.]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[jr];W[iq];B[mr];W[gp]SQ[qp][oq][lr][lq][jq][iq]
C[better to let go and play someweher else ...

SC:  Black doesn't respond to this move, so white loses Sente without gaining anything in return.  I don't think that any of the marked stones have done anything useful.  At the end of the game, all of these stones are dead.  Meanwhile, black has cut the L5 stones off from the rest of white's stones.  In the end these stones are dead as well.]
;B[pn]C[SC:  Now black cuts.];W[qo]SQ[mm][gc][el][jf]C[SC:  These stones are now trapped inside black's area.  If you think you can make two eyes, then it may be worth playing here. Otherwise, give them up as dead and take Sente to move somewhere else important.  The squares are all reasonable moves.]
;B[rq];W[rl];B[rk];W[qm];B[rm];W[pm];B[qk];W[rn];B[sl];W[nn]
;B[mn]
(;W[lm]SQ[dg]C[How to kill this stone ? or wsnt it possible ?

SC:  White can kill with a ladder.  See Variation.  The marked stone will end the ladder, although without this stone white still wins when the ladder hits the upper left side.]
;B[mm];W[ml]SQ[nl]C[SC:  White needs to connect the lower right side stones out to the middle since they only have one eye.  I prefer O8 since it makes a nice bamboo joint.]
;B[nl];W[om];B[ll];W[mk];B[ln]SQ[kp][mo][lo][ko]C[SC:  The marked stones are now dead.  Give them up and take Sente.]
;W[kn];B[km];W[nk]C[SC:  White is connected out to the middle, but the stones around L5 are dead.]
;B[fc]
(;W[ec]SQ[dc]C[SC:  Again, don't attach to a weak stone.  D17 defends the corner but doesn't tend to strengthen the black stone.  See Variation.]
;B[ib]C[SC:  This threatens to connect to black's stone at L18.]

(;W[fd]C[SC:  This implies that white will let black connect and will contain black to the top side while building a wall facing the center.  This is not going to capture the F17 stone.  See Variation.]
;B[gc];W[ic];B[ja];W[jc];B[hb]C[SC:  Now black has one strong group along the top.]
;W[fb]SQ[re][el][gd]C[SC:  This is fairly small and Gote.  Black doesn't have to respond, since he can play H17 if white plays G18.  The squares look bigger.]
;B[el];W[ek]C[SC:  Good.];B[fl];W[fk];B[gk];W[gj];B[pe];W[hk]
;B[gl];W[hj];B[bo];W[cq]SQ[bn]C[SC:  No, there is not enough room to make life here.  B6 blocks black out of white's side territory.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[bp];B[br]C[Uninvadable? Or just not a good idea ?

SC:  The invasion doesn't work.];W[gd]SQ[gg]C[SC:  Good, white now has a large potential territory around G13.]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[gb];W[he];B[eb];W[db];B[fa];W[lf]SQ[ig]C[SC:  J13 seals off a large area of territory for white.]

C[fight for survivle of this group starts];B[nh];W[mh];B[mg]
;W[mi];B[lg];W[ni];B[oh];W[oi];B[pj]SQ[oj]C[SC:  If black plays at the square white probably dies.]
;W[oj]C[SC:  White is alive now.];B[jj]
(;W[ih]SQ[il][ln]C[was it possible to connect  to the L5 group ?

SC:  No, the L5 group has been dead since black played at M6.

This move does a good job of sealing off white's area.  It works well because it isn't in contact with black.  J8 is a good way to reduce black's territory.  See variation.]
;B[hl];W[ok]TR[so][nm]SQ[nj]C[unnecessary here ? better to seal of territory 1st ?

SC:  This is unnecessary.  White is already alive here.  White has one eye at O10.  White can get another eye by playing at either of the triangles.]
;B[kf];W[kg];B[le];W[jn]C[SC:  The stones are dead so this doesn't help.]
;B[hp];W[kk];B[jk];W[nm];B[lm]

;B[se];W[sc];B[re];W[qc]SQ[bn]C[SC:  This is worth one point in Gote.  If you really want to play a Gote move then B6 is worth around 6 points in Gote.]
;B[bg]C[SC:  This is a hopeless invasion, but white does have to respond.]
;W[bi]C[black's invasion

SC:  This is the best way to defend.  Don't play contact here. Blocking one space away is best for now.]

(;W[rl]C[SC:  Here, black is stronger so it is a good idea for white to play a contact move.  What follows is one possible exchange, but there are many ways this could have turned out.  As black, I have made some moves that look OK intially but are really weak. So better play by black would change the end result.]
;B[rk];W[rm]C[SC:  White is making potential eye space.];B[pm]
;W[qk]TR[rk]SQ[on][ol]C[SC:  White ignores black's threat to cut and attacks along the side.  White comes out ahead if he loses the two marked stones but  manages to capture the stone at S9.  When invading, be willing to sacrifice half of your stones if the rest can live.]

SQ[ql][pi][qf]C[SC: Black is alive with around 6 points, but white has a large wall.  White can use the wall to attack the marked black stones. BTW, I played this stone to defend against a black push at Q17. I could have just played at Q17, but that would make bad shape (an empty triangle).  Whenever you find yourself about to make an empty triangle, pause and see if there is a better way to accomplish the same goal.  Plus, this move also works better to attack down the right side.]

Sacrificing one stone for Sente is almost always a good idea.  Black has a wall facing outward, but this wall is deep inside black's area of influence, so it is less useful.  White could use sente to approach the lower left corner and leave black with a lot less actual territory than we would have thought at move 10.  White could also extend down the left side to around D10]
