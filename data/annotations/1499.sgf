C[Dear reviewer

i played black (meekstone) in this game on IGS.
after a good start (i think...) i didnt really know how to use
my power right. i tried to attack my opponents weak groups, but
it seems i didnt do that well without knowing why it went wrong.
the game was over after i missed to give one of my groups live
after a few mistakes (but this wasnt too important to me).
i am especially interrested what went wrong from the opening
to the midgame, and how i should have better taken advantage
of my strong position on the top.
 i dont really care for the endgame, i think its more important
to focus on the opening and midgame first.

i have marked comments and questionswith "ms:"

thanks, meekstone


I think t building large frameworks of stones (moyos)  will help
you in the opening. In the middle game think about all the moves
you could do that have two functions like attackeing and building
territory or attacking and defending at the same time and make
those move your priority.

I hope these comments are some help to you in your development.
See you on IGS

influence attacking a pincer, if played by w

This was an excellant idea .. regain initiative .. unfortunately
the extension from the top group was too large.];W[cl]

Yes it is a god idea  .. you make marked group weak];B[gn];W[hm]

building territory when attacking if possible.]

the wrong way?

attack marked stone]
