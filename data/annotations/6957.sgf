C[SC I will put my initials in front of my comments to help make them stand out from the player's comments.

I have added several variations, so make sure to go through them all.  I have always made a note in the comments when a move has a variation.]
;B[pc]C[cook777 [5k?\]: Hi :)];W[dp]C[quindo [12k?\]: hi, good luck!]
;B[cd];W[pe]C[cook777 [5k?\]: Thanks you too.];B[nd]C[quindo [12k?\]: not that you need it... :-D]
;W[qc];B[qb]C[cook777 [5k?\]: well I could have bad luck then I would need it. :)]
;W[qd];B[pp]TR[qb]SQ[pb]C[quindo [12k?\]: good point...
cook777 [5k?\]: hmm

SC Black's top right group is not as secure as white's.  Black has a cutting point at Q18 and could lose the stone at R18.  Since this is early in the opening, trading the stone at R18 to play first in the lower right corner isn't a bad idea.  The important point is that black should realize the trade off being made here.  Playing this stone in the lower right implies black is not going to work very hard to save the stone at R18 if white tries to cut.  If black really wants to save the stone at R18, then this stone should be played at Q18 or P18.]
;W[ob]SQ[cf][dj][jp][np][nq][df]C[cook777 [5k?\]: lets see how it goes :)
quindo [12k?\]: lets see....

SC This is not the best move.  Before this move, both groups in the upper right corner were reasonably stable.  So, white doesn't need to play here to secure his stones.  This is still the opening game and all 4 sides have large open spaces.  The current move is more of a mid-game type move.

A good rule of thumb for the opening is to look for the largest open space and play somewhere in it.  The bottom and left sides are both good choices currently.  Any of the squares would be reasonable opening game moves.]

(;B[nb]C[quindo [12k?\]: i think thats my best bet

SC This move implies black is sacrificing the stone at R18, and probably the stone at Q17 in exchange for making a wall and keeping white out of the top side.  This is consistent with black's previous move since both lean towards sacrificing the stone at R18 to gain something elsewhere.

See the two variations for other black options at this point.]
;W[oc]
(;B[od]C[SC This move is fine, but it sets up a more complicated fight in this corner.  If black wants this sort of fight, then this is a good move.  The point is that black should be makeing a conscious decision to fight rather than just reacting.

See variation.];W[nc]C[quindo [12k?\]: i didn't see that]
(;B[lc]C[cook777 [5k?\]: I did not either intill jus tnow.

SC This is a contact fight.  Once a contact fight is started, you normally should continue until all of your groups are either dead or secure.  Secure generally means the group has 6 or more liberties.  This stone isn't in contact with any of the other stones, so it isn't really a contact fight type move.

See variation for a more standard contact fight.];W[md];B[mc]
;W[pb];B[me]TR[ao]SQ[md]C[SC The marked white stone is caught in a ladder that ends at A5.  Black needs to watch for white to play a ladder-breaker somewhere between these two points.]
;W[pd]TR[me][od][nd][mc][lc]SQ[pe][qd][qc][pb][ob][oc][nc]C[SC White's marked stones are now one secure group with 7 liberties. Black's marked stones are one group for now since the single white stone is dead, at least until white plays a ladder breaker. This group has enough liberties to be secure for the moment but black will need to do some actual connecting later.

So, this would be a good time for black to take Sente and play somewhere else.  This is still the opening phase of the game and there are still large areas of open space on the board.]

(;B[of]TR[ne]SQ[od][nd]C[SC This secures the cutting point at O15.  Even without this move, however, white can't capture the two marked stones.  This move just gives white sente without accomplishing much.

See Variation.];W[qn]C[quindo [12k?\]: I am sai :-D

SC Good, white is playing away from the upper right corner.]
;B[oo]SQ[qq][qp]C[quindo [12k?\]: lol

SC This move attacks white rather than secure the lower right corner for black.  Since white can run towards the strong white group in the upper right, an attack by black probably won't accomplish much.   Securing the corner by playing at one of the squares is better.

By the end of the game, black has lost this corner.];W[qk]SQ[pl]
C[SC This is rather low.  I think the square would be better.]
;B[ol]C[cook777 [5k?\]: Then I am cooked!]
(;W[ed]SQ[qn][qk]C[SC White's marked stones don't have room to make eyes where they are.  Since black did not secure the lower right corner, white can dive in under black.  This will save white's stones and take the corner away from black.  White could also continue to run up the right side.   Since white has 2 choices of escape and black can only block one at a time, white's stones are not in immediate danger.  So, it is reasonable for white to play away from the lower right at this time.

See variations for both options.];B[df]SQ[dc][cc]C[cook777 [5k?\]: Are you sure you are not a sandbagger?
quindo [12k?\]: yes

SC This response is best for securing part of the left side rather than the corner.  Either of the squares would be better if black wants to secure the corner.]
;W[cc]C[quindo [12k?\]: I have only played go for the time i have know you pretty much
quindo [12k?\]: d17 is tempting...

SC White now has control of this corner.];B[dj]C[SC This continues blacks strategy of taking the left side.]
;W[bd]C[quindo [12k?\]: what is a sandbagger?];B[ce];W[hc];B[jd]
C[cook777 [5k?\]: you said your sure you are not one but you do not know what one is. lol]
;W[jp]C[quindo [12k?\]: lol, i am guessing sandbagger is a really good player that says I am a noob! who wants to play me!

SC I would say this is the end of the opening phase of the game. The mid-game should be spent securing your own groups and expanding your territory while attacking your opponent's groups and shrinking his territory.]
;B[lp]TR[qp]SQ[mq][lq]C[SC All of black's stones in the lower right are on the 4th line or higher.  This arrangement does not secure the corner for black.

I think either of the squares is a better response to white's move.  

The triangle is also a reasonable response.  This prevents a white invasion of the corner from the stone at R6.  With the corner secure, black can attack white's K4 stone better.]
;W[hq]SQ[jq]C[cook777 [5k?\]: very close that can be one too.
cook777 [5k?\]: someone that is stronger but bertend to be weaker.

SC This stone doesn't secure the lower left corner.  It doesn't continue to pressure black's lower right corner.  It also doesn't prevent an invasion of the left lower side.

See the variation starting next move for an example of how black could invade the left lower side.

Playing at K3 helps secure the left lower side at least as well as the actual move.  Plus, K3 threatens to undercut black's high position in the right lower corner.]

(;B[gf]TR[pf][cq][dc][cn][fq]SQ[jc][cj][qp][lq]C[cook777 [5k?\]: In your case that what you said is exatly what I meant. :)
quindo [12k?\]: i think i have run into some of the direct opposite lol

SC This looks like an attempt to connect black's top right and top left groups.  Since both groups are strong, they don't need to be connected.  This move doesn't really threaten white's top left stones either.  So, this move doesn't accomplish much.  I think that all of the marked spots would be better moves for black.

The squares are all good defensive moves.  They help protect territory that black would like to claim.

The triangles are all reasonable moves to attack white.

See variation for an example of an invasion at F3.];W[jj]SQ[pj]
[dd][jb][co][cm][pf]C[quindo [12k?\]: ah, i was thinking about playing there my last move...
cook777 [5k?\]: I like G14 better :)

SC The center is very poor for making territory.  So, white should not play here expecting to increase his territory.  This could be used to attack one of black's weak groups.  If black has a weak group that can't make eyes, it would have to run out into the middle and connect to a strong black group to live.  A white stone here would help prevent this.

Black doesn't have any weak groups, however.  So this stone doesn't have a good purpose.

I think that the marked spots are all better moves for white.]
;B[hm]SQ[cn][lq][cj][jb][pf][qp]C[cook777 [5k?\]: umm someone I knwo would like to join the game so I tald him I as you if he can.
quindo [12k?\]: thats fine

SC See my comments on white's last move.  This stone doesn't make territory, doesn't attack white, and doesn't connect weak black groups.  So it has not real purpose.

I think the marked spots are all better moves for black.];W[cn]
C[quindo [12k?\]: as long as there is no kabitzing

SC This makes a black 3x3 point invasion of the lower left corner impossible.  So it secures the corner for white even though it isn't actually in the corner.  Since it also moves up the left side, it is a nice move.]
;B[dm]TR[dp][cn]SQ[cl]C[quindo [12k?\]: heard of emptytriangle.com?

SC Black is still playing too high.  This move makes it easy for white to undercut black's left side stones.  If black wants to secure the left side, C8 is better. 

Since white has a secure corner, the current move is not an effective way to attack the maked white stones.]
;W[bl]C[cook777 [5k?\]: hmm sounds like I heard it umm what is it?]
;B[ck]SQ[bj][cj]C[quindo [12k?\]: a go webcomic

SC This is still too high to block white from expanding further up the left side.  The squares are both better.  I know the square at C10 is on the 3rd line from the left side, like black's actual move.  So C10 is just as high as black's actual stone.  The C10 move works to block white because it is connected to the existing black stone at D10.]

(;W[hj]SQ[lq][ai][jb][rq][pf]C[quindo [12k?\]: now i can't make a box :-(

SC More center moves with no good purpose.  I think the marked moves are all better for white.

The only good thing this stone does is break the ladder traping the white stone at N16.  So, if white played here to free that stone, then this would be an OK move.

White invasion of the lower right corner at S3 has been covered in a previous variation.

See the variations on this move for examples of how to play A11 and M3]
;B[gj]C[quindo [12k?\]: actually thats false

SC This stone un-breaks the ladder, so the white stone at N16 can't escape now.]
;W[gi];B[gk];W[hh]C[SC White is trying to make a group in the center.  This is very difficult because you have to enclose all 4 sides. 

A better idea is to connect these center stone to one of white's side groups.

An even better idea is to stop wasting time playing in the center and attack black's left side and right lower corner areas.]
;B[jh]TR[pj][he][jm]SQ[kr][be][bk][qp][pf][jb]C[SC Black doesn't need to spend time trying to kill white's center group.  With all of the black stones facing the center, white will never be able to make much center territory even if white does live.  The purpose of the game is to make territory.  So, trying to actually kill white is not the important issue.

Black should just try to keep white from connecting to any side groups.  The triangles all good options for blocking white.

The squares are all good options for black to increse his amount of territory.  Black doesn't really have any secure territory at this point.  

Both the left side and bottom right corner are wide open for attack and reduction by white.  

The areas around M18 and M16 will probably black territory eventually, but they are not secure yet.  At the end of the game, black ends up with only 1 point of territory at N16 plus the captured white stone in this area.]
;W[ji];B[ih]C[SC Black is playing a contact fight against white's center group. A contact fight is normally not the best way to kill a group, however.  A contact fight tends to strengthen both player's groups. So, a contact fight is best when you have a weaker group and your opponent's group is stronger.  Making your weak group strong helps you.  Making your opponent's strong group strong doesn't help him.

The best way to kill white's group, if you really want to, is to block it from escaping to any of the sides.  A center group is more likely to make life by connecting to a strong side group than by making eyes in the center.

At the end of the game, white had made eyes in the center; but white had to connect to the lower left corner to avoid being captured.]
;W[hk]C[cook777 [5k?\]: teamochi says you are winning.

SC Since white's center group is weak, a contact fight is good for white.]
;B[jl]SQ[jp]C[SC This is a better sort of move for black.  It is not a contact move.  Instead, it helps blocks white from connecting to the marked stone.]
;W[kh];B[hg]TR[kh]SQ[jh][ih]C[quindo [12k?\]: that shouldn't last to long

SC This is a contact move again.  Black is trying to save the two marked stones.  Those stone are in trouble because black played them in contact with white.

Another very good option here is for black to start playing along any of the sides to start making territory.

The last time black played close to a side was move number 43 at C9.  The current move is the 6th stone black has played since then.  How much more territory does black have now than he did at move 43?
The marked white stone will probably keep black from making more than 1 or 2 points of territory around K14.
The area around E9 could become about 6 points of territory when black finishes enclosing it, which, however, will require more black stones.
So, black has gained about 8 points for the past 6 moves.  Save the 1 point moves for the endgame where they belong.]
;W[kl]C[SC White is trying to get around black blockade and connect with the bottom white group.]
;B[gh]SQ[gj][ih]C[SC Black attacks a false eye.  The marked black stones already make this a false eye.]

(;W[hi]SQ[gi][hh]C[cook777 [5k?\]: Do not be serprised if he ask you for a game one day :)
quindo [12k?\]: lol

SC White should focus on saving the majority of the stones in this center group.  White should sacrifice the two marked stones and follow up on the attempt to escape from the center started last move by the stone at L8.

See variation for an example of how this might go.]
(;B[km]C[SC Black blocks white again.  This leaves black with a cutting point at K7.

See variation.];W[ll];B[lm]TR[lj]SQ[kq][bk][be][jb][pf][qp]
C[SC Black has already blocked white from connecting to the lower side.  Black could use this move to fix the cutting point at K7.    If black wants to kill white, the playing around M10 is better for destroying white's eye space.

As always, the squares are all better moves for black than anything in the center.]
;W[ml];B[nj]SQ[mm]C[SC This is a better move for black.  It does not contact any white stones but it threatens white's entire group much more than black continuing the contact fight at N7.]
;W[jk];B[il]SQ[ij]C[quindo [12k?\]: maia ^^

SC This keeps white from making an eye at J10.]
(;W[ei]TR[lj]SQ[gj][gh]C[quindo [12k?\]: i knew you would see that...
cook777 [5k?\]: What is maia?
quindo [12k?\]: i think thats how its spelled...

SC White has no stones around B12, so running this way won't help white much at all.  This move does not help white make any eyes since the marked black stones will make an eye around G11 false.  So, this move doesn't really help white.

Playing at M10 is better.

See the variation.];B[fh]SQ[lj]C[SC M10 is a good place for black to play.]
;W[fi]C[quindo [12k?\]: if one player takes a the otehr take b and vice versa
cook777 [5k?\]: ok];B[dh]C[quindo [12k?\]: its some of the few go termalogy i know]
;W[pi]C[SC This strengthens white's right side stones, but they were already stronger than the white's center stones.

White has played so many stones in the center that he can't afford to lose them now.  So, white should focus on saving these stones.]
;B[nh]C[cook777 [5k?\]: ya I do not know if its spelled righ or not I just know it when I see it in a go book.
quindo [12k?\]: this situation has gotten crazy...

SC This is a very nice blocking move by black.  Now white has no obvious way to connect to the right side stones.  Black has already closed off any obvious escape towards white's bottom left stones.  Now it looks like white will need to make 2 eyes in the center to live.]
;W[mi];B[ni]
(;W[mh]SQ[mj]C[cook777 [5k?\]: oh?

SC N10 is better since it encloses space for white to start making eyes.  This move would be good if there were white stones in the top right that white's center group could connect to.

See Variation]
(;B[lj];W[mj];B[mg]C[quindo [12k?\]: i need to keep you from making 2 eyes...]
;W[lg]C[cook777 [5k?\]: yup :)];B[mf]
(;W[jg]TR[lh]SQ[kg]C[SC L13 is better since it starts to make an eye around M12.

See variation];B[ig];W[jf]C[quindo [12k?\]: you didn't see it?]
;B[kf]TR[qp][kq][jb][bk][be]SQ[mk][li][kg]C[quindo [12k?\]: i think you missed a path to free life

SC Black should consider ignoring white's center group and making territory on the side.  If this white group does live, it will probably have less than 6 points of territory.  So, if black stops attacking and lets white live, then black has given white about 6 points.  

White can make the center group unconditionally alive by playing at the squares.  There are other ways for white to secure this group, but this is a reasonable example.   Since white has to play 3 stones in the center to secure the center group, black will, at some point, get to play 3 stones on the sides without white responding.

If black can gain more than 6 points using these 3 'free' moves on the side, then black is better off letting white live in the center.  Each of the triangles should shift the score 6 or more points in black's favor.]
;W[lf];B[ke]C[cook777 [5k?\]: maybe we will have to look.];W[kg]
C[quindo [12k?\]: ya...];B[ie];W[ik]C[SC This is a dame point.  This means playing here doesn't change the score.  Perhaps white is hoping that black will no see the need to play at J11.  Otherwise, white could accomplish about a much by passing.]
;B[ii]C[quindo [12k?\]: see maia];W[hl];B[gm];W[gl]C[cook777 [5k?\]: How long have I know you again?
quindo [12k?\]: idk, a little after i registered on ogs
quindo [12k?\]: now, how to save those 2 stones...]
(;B[fk]SQ[gj][gk]C[quindo [12k?\]: your fri left

SC An empty triangle is a bad shape.  This means that making a empty triangle is almost always not your best move.  In general, the only time an empty triangle is good is when you are making eyes.  So, if you are considering a move that makes an empty triangle, stop and look carefully for a better move.

See variation.];W[fl];B[ek];W[fm];B[fn]C[quindo [12k?\]: i think i might get this game reviewed by someone...]
;W[en]C[quindo [12k?\]: looking at the board it comes down to this, if white finds life white wins, if white doesn't black wins
quindo [12k?\]: hmm...
cook777 [5k?\]: That is waht I intended form the start :)
quindo [12k?\]: i am not good enough at reading to read it out...

;B[dn];W[do]C[quindo [12k?\]: O.o
cook777 [5k?\]: Not what you were thinking was it? :)
quindo [12k?\]: no, it looks like a bad move to me...]
(;B[eo]SQ[em]C[SC Playing at E7 is better.

This is the move that begins to set black up to have a large group of threatened stones around G5.  When white connects at E7, black's stones around H7 are cut off from the stones around E9

See variation];W[em]
(;B[go]C[cook777 [5k?\]: I will tell you a secret after this game is over :P
quindo [12k?\]: i think i see now
quindo [12k?\]: what you were and are trying to do
quindo [12k?\]: so, why did your friend leave?
cook777 [5k?\]: well lest try and see what happnes :) the secret is nto what I am trying to do. :)

SC If white places a stone on M11, his center group will be alive with 2 eyes.  If black plays on M11 first, then white only gets 1 eye.

See variation];W[jm]C[cook777 [5k?\]: I do not know he did nto say.

SC is the other key move in black's destruction.  This move threatens to cut black's stones around G7 away from the right lower corner.]

(;B[im]SQ[il][jl]C[SC Black must sacrifice the two marked stones to save the rest. Don't expect to save all of your stones.  Sometimes playing a sacrifice stone on purpose is useful.  At other times, you have to let your opponent have a few of your stones to save the rest.

When white plays at K6 next trun, black's stones around G7 are cut off and in serious trouble.  Black should play on K6 first.

In the request for a review, black asked how his group of stones could have been saved.  The short answer is don't play this move. The point is that it is easy to get focused on the local situation (save two threatened stones) and forget to step back and look at the whole board situation (my weak group is about to be cut off).

Black and white have both spent most of the game playing each move within 2or 3 spaces of the opponent's last move.  Often, there will be a place on the other side of the board that is worth more than playing right next to your opponent's last stone.

See variation.];W[jn]C[cook777 [5k?\]: jsut that he had to go.]
;B[io]C[cook777 [5k?\]: *talks to him on skybe.*
quindo [12k?\]: lol];W[jo]C[quindo [12k?\]: now i need to find life ;-p]

(;B[fq]SQ[in]C[SC Black needs to think about making 2 eyes.  Playing at J6 makes 1 eye right away.

See variation.  

This was the last move for black where I could find a variation that saved black's stones.  So, as best I can tell, black is doomed after this turn unless white makes an error.]
;W[eq]C[cook777 [5k?\]: My gut says there is life.

SC White should capture at F5.  This allows white to connect his center group to the lower left corner.  This connection avoids the capture race shown in a previous variation.

If white doesn't connect to the lower left corner, black can fill the liberties marked with squares and then capture at the false eye.]

SC White spent too much time and effort trying to make territory in the center.  At the end of the game, white's center group has 43 stones.  These 43 stones have managed to surround 3 points of territory (if we count E5).  In comparison, white has 18 stones in the top left corner surrounding 17 points of territory.

Black spent too much time and effort chasing white around the center of the board.   White's center group, like most center groups, surrounded almost no territory.  So, black would have gained more by playing along the sides or corners and letting white live in the center.

Early in the game, black played too may stones in a high position (meaning 4 or more lines from the closest side).  This allowed white to move in under black's stones and take territory.

Finally, for both players, it is possible to play an excellent game of Go without killing any of your opponent's groups.  The game is won by making the most territory, not by killing the most stones.  It is true that killing stones will make territory, but it is not the only way to make territory.]

;W[oc]SQ[mc]C[SC White can't cut at Q18, which was probably white's plan.  So white could try to escape along the top side by playing at N17, or extend towards the other white stones at P17.]
;B[od]C[SC Black blocks];W[pd]TR[oc][ob]SQ[qb][pc][pb]C[SC White cuts.  Now we have a capture race.  Black's 3 marked stones and White's 2 marked stones have 3 liberties each.  Since it is black's turn, the race favors black at the moment.]
;B[nc]C[SC Black starts to reduce white's liberties.  Black could play at S18 and increase his liberties to 5, but white's 2 stones might escape out to the top side and black would have to make 2 eyes in the corner.  So, I think the current move is better than S18.]
;W[nb]C[SC Each group has 3 liberties, but it is still black's turn.]
;B[mb];W[rb];B[oa]C[SC This stone could also go at O19.  The end result would be the same.]
;W[rc]SQ[na]C[SC White realizes the capture race is lost and decides to connect his stones.

Black could take Sente here and wait until later to play O19. Doing so would leave a nice ko threat for white to use later. For purposes of this example, black will finish capturing white.]
;B[na]TR[qa][ob]SQ[qg]C[SC Black wins the capture race and has a living group here.  The group is unconditionally alive because black can make 2 eyes.
If white plays R19, the black plays P18 and makes 2 eyes.  Black would eventually have to connect at either N19 or N17, but white can't prevent this.
If white plays at P18, then black can make 2 eyes by playing at R19.
White has a strong group that probably can't be killed.  Black could play around R13 and pressure this group, however.  So, I think this exchange favors black.  White does end up with Sente.]

(;B[oc]SQ[pe]C[SC Black blocks white's stone from trying to connect with the stones around Q15. This move sacrifices the black stone at R18.]
;W[pb]SQ[mb]C[SC If white doesn't cut here, and instead jumps to N18; then black will connect at Q18 and white will have to make 2 eyes on the top side.]
;B[nb]TR[qb]SQ[pb][ob]C[SC Now we have a capture race.  White's 2 marked stones and black's marked stone each have 2 liberties.  Since it is white's turn, the race favors white.  Black knows this and is planning to force white to capture the sacrifice at R18 in exchange for building a wall.]
;W[rb];B[oa];W[qa];B[oe]C[SC White has as strong group in the corner.  Black has a wall facing the top side.  If black manages to use the wall effectively, then this is about an even exchange.]
