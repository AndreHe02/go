C[Not the best in hcp games, but not a fault.
O16 is the move];W[pf];B[ne]MA[nc][nd]C[greedy. Usually O16 or O17]
;W[od]C[eh ... normal sanction];B[nd]C[I wonder if I should have played P15 there instead.

Yes, because it cuts W
(see general rules at hcp game at the end)];W[oc];B[pc];W[fd]
;B[dg]MA[df]C[slack, but not an error. D14 usual here];W[oe]
C[W connects];B[of]C[this is very bad.

1) the move does not have a purpose : W connects with Q15
2) you place a stone against 2 W stones (losing 2 liberties)]
;W[pe];B[ng];W[ff];B[fh]C[I wanted to block whites route out in the middle. Is a move at J13 better for instance? I considered both options.

F12 is OK
J13 helps building territorry in the middle, which is better (see end rules)]
;W[mf];B[nf];W[jf]C[When I defended the peep and he played this move, I thought that whites upper side was getting too strong.

Not yet, O15 group is stronger, but you have to use this strenght]
;B[lh]MA[hf][le]C[I would have played at H14 to use the O15 strength. and help K16.

Other than H14, M15 helps K16

Beside, N14 is "kikashi" (forcing move) and will be sacrified]
;W[ld];B[he]C[With this move, I'm trying to pull my K16 stone out into the center while cutting white off.

smart];W[gg];B[hh]MA[hg]C[too far.
H13 safer];W[ke]C[W protects the cut and connects];B[hg]C[ok.
Now W is cut in 2 weak groups, which is good.];W[hf];B[if];W[gf]
;B[ie]C[Here, I consider myself in the lead in the upper side.

If we are talking pure "side", this is a false impression.
P17 has more roots than you have.

If you count corners, this is true, but you want to count them separately]
;W[gh];B[hi];W[nc];B[mc];W[md];B[lc];W[kc];B[kb]C[I think this move is dubious. Maybe I should have gone for L16?

No, because of N14, L16 does not give an interesting result (I'll let you explore)]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[jb];B[la];W[jc]
(;B[hc]C[I try to keep his leftmost group isolated with this move.

Now L16 was good ...];W[nb]C[I realised that with that move, my group at the top is dead. Any way to save it?

No, not anymore];B[gi];W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[cd];W[gb];B[gd]MA[hb]
C[H18 better, cuts white];W[gc];B[ge];W[fe];B[hb];W[ed]
(;B[id]C[bad.

1) you lose a move because W can't cut you direcly there
2) you are not making an eye because W can play at J17

see var];W[na]C[W lost a move as well];B[re];W[rf];B[rc]C[Keeping my isolated group alive

yes];W[qa];B[sf]MA[pa][qb]C[Hmmm, R19 should be answered, I think]
;W[sg];B[se];W[rh];B[qb];W[cb];B[bb];W[da];B[ac]C[not usefull]
;W[fb]C[a B stone here killed W];B[pm]C[Building a box shape]
;W[mg];B[mh];W[pa];B[pb]C[good];W[np];B[no]TR[pm]MA[pq]C[I did not know how to answer his move here. Should I have defended below with a move at O3 or such a move?

Your move has a good purpose, whi is to keep W low
However, contact play reinforces W

Q3 ok with Q7];W[op];B[oo];W[pq];B[qp];W[qq];B[rq]C[Trying to confine him to a small spot as possible.

ok, but beware of S12, which will invade you nice right side]
;W[lq]C[That was a good move I think, expanding his territory

yes, but there is no harm yet];B[kq]MA[gq][jq]C[too close, may be]
;W[mo];B[lp];W[mp]
(;B[lo]C[see var for later];W[mn];B[nm]TR[no][oo][pm]C[good shape]
;W[qk]C[eh ...];B[qj];W[rj];B[pk];W[ql];B[qm];W[lm];B[jm]C[correct side]
;W[me];B[mk]C[Ouch !
Now O13 dead];W[nh]C[I realise my group is dead. And learned my lesson.

:-)];B[jg]MA[cm][cn][mq]C[you don't fear a cut at J13 (I'll let you explore).
You can play elsewhere];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[cl];B[ck]

Yes, THIS is the key to Hcp games];W[rr];B[rp];W[lr];B[kr];W[es]
;B[fs];W[fr]C[Good move which I did not see coming.

Okay, this is a ko.
You must have big threats to play it

C[Unnescesary move where I just didn't know where to move.


Then pass !!!!!!

Don't lose a point !

But you have plenty of ko threats];W[sa];B[tt]C[Cannot find any more end game points.]
;W[tt]C[okay.

The rules at hcp are :

- keep W low, and control centre (let him crawl 3rd line if he likes)
- play high
- separate his groups


Overall, you probably need to pay attention to what cut threats are, fake and real (see moves 105, 106 , 207, and 186 as a more complex one).

With regard to your strenght, I'm afraid this is VERY difficult to estimate. If you want to know, just start and play rated games, and then your strenght will be what is computed (and that will be your REAL strenght).
On IGS, substract 3 kyus

As a ROUGH estimate, you are between 15 and 25, I would say, but I don't want to be more specific, because I would be wrong ...

Hope this helped])
