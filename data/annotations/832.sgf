C[
is this move good, or is there something better in your
opinion?

CG: After exchanging B4 for C3, an extension to D10 is bad because black cannot invade at C3 if white invades at C8. I usually play the low extension at D9, but with black C5 this would be too low. So D9 looks ok, but C11 will be a good point for white, and you should keep this aji in your mind when deciding which moves too play in the upper left.]
;W[dc];B[gc]C[Since you already played D9, I would consider the pressing move E16 or the taisha first. Since I do not play G17 myself, I do not know if there is a variation where white can take advantage of the aji of C11.]
;W[ed];B[ef]C[i was unsure where to move here, since didnt
know any joseki for the c15 stone.  i think this move is bad.  or maybe its
okay and i just play it
wrong...

CG: Since C15 involves a lot of very difficult variations, I would not play it until you know the most important joseki and - most important - their meaning with respect to the rest of the board. E14 looks ok as it is played in the right direction - black wants to strengthen his position on the left.]
;W[cd];B[be];W[gd];B[hd];W[fc];B[hc]C[Oops. You must not miss the kikashi at G15.]
;W[ge];B[lc];W[nc];B[gg]LB[if:a]C[maybe pushing
from the other side with j14 is
better?

CG: No, I think this is the right direction.];W[he];B[ie];W[if]
;B[je]C[CG: These exchanges are very bad for white since ithey eliminate any aji at K17. White gets neither territory for them nor do they strengthen the corner.]
;W[nq]C[CG: Wrong direction because F3 is low. White R6, black O3, white Q10 would be better.]
;B[oq]C[Oops. Don't play this move if there is no black stone at K4.]
;W[np];B[pn];W[jq]C[CG: While O4 helps white a lot to handle an invasion at M3, you gained very little since the corner is still open. P3 is a good attacking move if there is already a black stone at K4, but it is very bad if you want to secure territory.]
;B[qi]LB[qf:a]C[i
did not know what was the best move here.  is this right?  or perhaps r14?
or something else?

CG: You should decide wether to attack the upper rigth corner or to secure your territory on the right. Your move doesn't either and I don't understand the meaning of this move.
Since your territory on the right can't  be secured  with one move, I would play R14.]
;W[qk]C[Too early.  R8 might be the better move, and I would wait until I could decide which one to play. If white wants to invade immediately, R8 looks better.]
;B[qm]C[CG: This is a difficult move. The direction is right, but R6 would be better if it secures the corner after b R3 w Q3.]
;W[qj]C[Ouch. This move feels like banging your head against the wall. White should just jump to P9.]
;B[pi];W[ok];B[qf]LB[ni:a][mk:b]TR[pd][qi][if][qk][ie]C[i
did not want to push at o11 because i thought b o11, w n9 gave white a nice
wall that worked well with his lower territory.  the relationship between
the marked stones is very perplexing for me -- i dont know how to evaluate
it!

CG: Again, this is a difficult decision. After R14, white can attack you with S15. Maybe O11 - making an invasion at R17 more severe - is the right idea. I wouldn't be satisfied with R14 because this extension is too narrow.]
;W[qe];B[pf];W[ne]C[i think now black has two weak
groups, the j15 stones and the q11-q14 stones.  when white moved here, i
said, 'how did i get into this position?!?  i am going to lose!' that is why
i ran at o11 (next
move)

CG: The J15 stones are strong, not weak.];B[ni];W[mk];B[li]
;W[hg]TR[ie]C[i am not
sure what the point of this move is, perhaps to weaken the j15 stones?  in
any case, i think it hurts the invasion white attempts the next move..

CG: This moves fixes the weakness at H14, but I don't think that white should be afraid of this cut since it would weaken the left side territory.]
;B[gh]C[CG: White has just helped you to strengthen yor left side. Now L9 has become a key point.]
;W[ei]C[i thought this was overplay, but white gets a ko
fight thanks to my poor tactical
skills...

CG: I agree on this being an overplay. At least the white stones on the right will be weakened, making it hard for white to build a larger moyo on the lower side.]
;B[fj]C[CG: This might also be an overplay. Just attacking with D12 should be good enough.]
;W[cj];B[ck]C[perhaps d10 better?
hmm..

CG: No, after F10 you must play here.];W[ej];B[ek];W[fi];B[gi]
;W[df];B[de];W[ee];B[eg];W[gj];B[fk];W[fg];B[ff];W[dg];B[dh]
;W[ch];B[cg];W[di];B[cf];W[bk];B[bl];W[bi];B[bh];W[bg];B[ci]
;W[cl];B[bm]C[should
i just d12 instead?  this fight is very difficult for me to figure
out!];W[ch];B[ah];W[ag];B[ci];W[qq];B[ch]C[is there
a better alternative?

CG: No, this is perfectly ok.];W[ro]C[now i am in
trouble!

Since you gained a lot on the left, you just have to live. I would play O7 now.]
;B[qp]C[CG: This is a very bad move since it eliminates the possibility of building one eye with S6 and S8.]
;W[rp];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rm];B[rl];W[rn];B[ql];W[ri]LB[nm:a]
C[should
white connect at o7 instead of this move?

CG: No, letting black connect with S10 would be very bad.];B[nl]
;W[ol];B[nn];W[om];B[on];W[nk];B[ln];W[lp]LB[kk:a][rh:b]C[perhaps
w l9 is better here?  or maybe s12?

CG: No, with M6, black might live with the cut O2, w N2, b N3.]
;B[jn];W[io]LB[kk:a][rh:b]C[w l9 better now, i think...
perhaps w s12
first..

CG: Yes, attacking black by pushing the group against whites weakness looks bad. But white may have judged that he can't win if black continues to run into whites moyo.]
;B[in];W[hn];B[hm];W[gn];B[il]LB[rh:a]C[perhaps
just b s12 right now];W[gm]C[this seems to be a very bad move to me, or perhaps i speak
too soon..];B[rh]C[the white group is      now if i am not
mistaken..];W[rk];B[sl];W[kk];B[ji];W[ik];B[gl];W[hk];B[hl]
;W[ii];B[jj];W[oi];B[oh];W[oj];B[nh];W[km];B[ll]C[this move (m8) seems to work i
think..];W[lm];B[ml];W[lj];B[kl];W[ki];B[kh];W[mi];B[lh];W[mh]
;B[mg];W[mj];B[jh];W[ng];B[nf];W[og];B[pg];W[mf];B[of];W[lg]
;B[ng];W[jk];B[ih];W[hh];B[hi];W[jl];B[jm];W[ij];B[kf];W[lf]
;B[jf]LB[le:a]C[m15
better.  i make many more, larger mistakes fighting, later in the game --
but do not worry about reviewing those, unless you think that there is some
really big point that i missed.

CG: M15 is better, but that doesn't matter any more. Now should play as save as possible, and avoid any moves you cannot read out. Whites only hope is a tactical blunder by black.]
