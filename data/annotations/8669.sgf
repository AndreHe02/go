C[***Hi, thanks for taking the time to look at this. I've played about 50 games and would really like to find one or two key areas that you think I should be looking to focus on improving.

***I played Black and have reviewed this myself making a few comments here and there to explain the 'reasoning' behind my decisions.

***Thank you :) enjoy the game.

rullieta [16k\]: hi,gg

$ Hi, I'm Stefan. Let's see if I can help you some way.];B[dd]
C[XiaoLuo [16k\]: hi, have fun];W[pp];B[qd];W[cp];B[oc]C[*** Is this a strange opening? I like to try and secure one corner to take the pressure off having to fight too much later.

$ No, this is perfectly OK. Top players have played like this,]
;W[iq]C[$ White plays the Chinese Opening. He will try to force you to invade his formation so he can attack the invasion.]
;B[qn]C[$ Very good! This is the primary direction to develop from your top right corner.]
;W[np];B[pk]C[$ Up to here Black has played very well.];W[cf]
;B[dh];W[ff]C[$ This is too loose. Black can play D14 immediately...]
;B[gd];W[df]C[*** I've read about pincers, but I'm not sure on what their purpose is. Do you pincer someone to make them run towards a wall of yours?

$ Well, to make them run. By pincering you deny the approaching stone to develop in the opposite direction of the corner, so usually he'll run like in this situation or jump into the corner.

By the way, a pincering is much better if the pincering stone has backing from the corner, in this situation from the bottom left. Now the D12 stone will feel quite lonely soon.]
;B[ek]C[$ This looks a little weird to me. I would have played a little more "grounded" at C9.]
;W[cc];B[cd]C[$ This is not so good. You cannot kill him, and the C14 group is far from dead. See variation.]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[bd];B[ee]C[$ I like E18 better. White cannot cut (read it out!), and later you can play C18 or B19 to reduce the corner. Here, you basically force White to connect where he would have had to connect anyway - a "thank you" move.

Another option is B15 to isolate the D14 group.];W[ef];B[gf]
C[$ Not good. An attachment is not an attack, but an invitation to get stronger. H14 would have been much better. If White continued with F15 it could become quite uncomfortable for Black.]
;W[fh]C[$ Good! White does not want to get shut in.];B[gg]C[$ Good! This would have been a great move for White.]
;W[eh];B[di];W[gi]C[$ White has managed to get out, but Black has a good wall now. Maybe White should have connected at B15 earlier.]
;B[jd]C[$ On one hand you further secure the top, on the other hand it's a bit passive. Why not E4?

Also you must think of the safety of the weak D11 group.];W[pg]
;B[qh];W[pe];B[qe];W[pd];B[pc];W[me];B[ne];W[nd]C[$ Maybe better O14 to get something towards the center. Black has handled this well.]
;B[nf];W[od];B[mf];W[mc];B[ld];W[ep]C[$ White abandons his group. Finish him off!]
;B[bg]C[*** this felt a bit wasteful. perhaps I could have gone somewhere around G9 or C6 to help create some space for that side group.

$ True. It would have been good to block White's primary development direction here. I think I would have played C7 or even C8; C6 seems a bit too close to the White corner.]
;W[bf];B[cg]C[$ Not necessary. C7, P6, M17, J5, ... A lot of great moves are waiting.]
;W[cl]C[$ Good! White punishes Black's small scale play.];B[gk]
;W[ii]C[$ Good! White cannot allow to lose the whole center.]
;B[go]C[$ This looks a bit aimless. I admit I'm a bit at a loss as to what would be better. To me it seems better to defend at C10 or so; or to play E7 first.]
;W[em]C[$ Great attacking move of White: threatening to cut off G5 while making territory. (This is also the reason why Black maybe should have played E7 himself: Your opponent's good move is your good move.)]
;B[fm];W[en];B[fn]C[$ F8 is better here. White gets some good moves: E8 then D9.]
;W[gq];B[kp];W[io]C[$ Good!];B[in]C[$ I think L6 is better here; you cannot connect this way if White plays properly...]
;W[ik]C[$ ...but he lets you off the hook: K5 is a no-brainer here.]
;B[jn];W[mn];B[hp];W[ip];B[hq];W[hr];B[jo];W[kq];B[lq];W[kr]
;B[oq];W[op];B[nq];W[pq];B[mp];W[mr];B[lr];W[ls];B[mq];W[os]
;B[nr];W[ms];B[ns];W[ks];B[pr];W[qr];B[qs];W[rs];B[qq];W[rr]
;B[qp];W[mo];B[lo];W[ps];B[po];W[oo]C[$ Ugh. P6 instead.];B[on]
;W[or]C[$ At this point Black has the whole top and right side under control and leads by large.]
;B[lp];W[nn]C[$ Not necessary. M5 or jump to N8.];B[om]C[$ Good.]
;W[ln];B[jp]C[$ Not necessary. L5 and K4 are miai for connection. O9 looks good, or K13 to really get a lot of territory on the top. It might be better to connect at H6 first,]
;W[kl]C[This accomplishes nothing as the Black group seems to be alive. I think at this point White could give up if he doesn't manage to live on the top.]
;B[jh]C[I thought I would be 'suffocating' white and stopping him from gaining any centre territory, is this a valid strategy?

$ There's not a lot of territory in the center, but of course it's good to get it for yourself ^^ K13 seems a bit more cautious. Sooner or later you'll have to kill the top White group. L17 seems to be adequate.]
;W[gp];B[ho];W[jq];B[jj]C[$ This is not good. You create a cutting point by yourself. Now that you have the ladder breaker at K12 in place, play N16.

To continue in the center I prefer L10 or M11 or even O9.];W[ij]

XiaoLuo [16k\]: thanks, that was really close
rullieta [16k\]: yeah, weird game
XiaoLuo [16k\]: I thought once I lost that upper side you had won it
rullieta [16k\]: no, i was far behind
rullieta [16k\]: maybe with the other groupe
XiaoLuo [16k\]: hmm to me it seemed you were ahead, maybe because of the large secure territory in the lower left
XiaoLuo [16k\]: I hope to see you around, I gotta head off to uni now. Thanks again
rullieta [16k\]: thank you, have a good day

$ In total, Black played a much better opening and was leading the whole time, making this a quite one-sided game. The White success on the top made a major impact, though, but that was not enough to turn the game around.

Tips for you:
- Don't attach so much.
- Don't automatically connect/defend. Often there's no need to, and you can play a sente move somewhere else.
- Strategically you seem to play well, but you could improve tactically. Do more tsumego ^^

I hope my review was interesting for you. 

Bye
