C[dear reviewer,
I think I've lost this game by misunderstanding the global situations on the board.
Probably I've done mistakes in the directions of play, but I don't know when, and what where the mistakes !
I've pointed some positions where I had questions. I would be very pleased if you could help me to find some answers.
best regards
Laurent (LL)

Hello!

I am Bernd, HonFu in the GTL and in other go places. So let's see what we've got here!]

how to play for black, now ???
(LL)

Hon: A pincer looks reasonable, but maybe rather K16 or L16 than the very close one.

Remember - a pincer is a threat to kill a stone. If you threaten to kill him only small, it will be that much less of a threat. Also you got to watch out that the pincer is not too loose so that in the end your stone becomes weaker than the pincered stone!]

C[Hon: Now what have M14 and M12 got you? Half an eye, and white has been strengthened. Better left unplayed, since there was more aji than just this.]
;W[cm];B[ek];W[bi];B[gk];W[gi];B[fm];W[li]C[Hon: locally (after top is okay) surroundind white down there looks not bad.]
(;B[ii]C[black cannot connect his two groups, but wants to reinforce the upper one...
(LL)

Hon: If you see that an attempt to connect (or to do anything) fails, mostly it is best not to play it at all. Look for something else.]

;W[lj]TR[gh][mh][nm][qm]C[black is still behind... what to do now, with "sente" ???
(LL)

Hon: Kill something (I don't see anything), otherwise try to play a better endgame. Looks hard though.]
(;B[qm];W[kj];B[ji];W[pg]LB[oe:A][qg:B]C[well done, this move is embarrassing for black.
(LL)

Hon: This doesn't make such a large change in score. Just a bit of shoving and pushing.]
(;B[oe];W[le];B[ke];W[me];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pl];B[ql];W[hc]
C[Hon: Large.

From now on it is only endgame, so let's stop here. 

I think your choice of pincer in the upper right was not so good because it left you with a weak group. Then you put too much weight on the lower side where everything was alive anyway and missed your chance to take the keypoint in the top left. Lastly, the fight in the lower left looked like not the best you could have done there. Better than killing something (which is often too small and most of the times gote) is letting it live, but using it to make profit in sente, then go someplace else.

I hope this review gave you some helpful pointers. Good luck with your further improvement!]
