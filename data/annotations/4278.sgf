C[Kazekage [12k\]: hi

A: Dear backpacker,
I saw a big mistake in the beggining, handling an invasion to your sanrensei pattern on the upper side.

But I think you need to study more tactic moves like hane, kosumi, attachments, capping, and shoulder hits.

Otherwise, I wish you lots of success in your next Go games.
Sincerely,

;W[cn]
(;B[dr]C[A: I think playing around the corner now is a little early  for the opening stage of the game. You could play tenuki here and take Q12 (or Q14), threatening the overextended lower right corner, so that you emphasize you san-ren-sei pattern in the upper side.]
;W[cq]
(;B[ip]C[A: I think B19 at H4 makes  slightly better shape with the extension Bd2-Bf3.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[df]
(;W[ic]C[I think, W24 should be at H16]
(;B[id]C[I am thinking that K17 would be better here because white would be too thick and I would start to get the right upper corner better.

A: Of course! You are allowing W to settle too easily here.]
;W[jc];B[hd];W[hc];B[kd]C[The four stone wall B27-29 is badly positioned against WR10]
;W[qg];B[kc];W[ff];B[dh];W[bi]C[suddenly the lower left looks like white's territory.  What did I do wrong?

A: You are behind because you chose the wrong direction to block W's invasion in the upper side.]
;B[rd]C[A: big, but no threat for W];W[jj]C[A: but this stone looks like a UFO to me]
;B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[nm];B[mm];W[ml]
(;B[lm]C[A: I think playing double hane at M8 works better for B]
;W[ll];B[km];W[kl]C[A: W's wall now looks better than B's.]
;B[jm];W[fo]
(;B[go]C[A: This contact move is poor style. If you want to defend territory, just play solid at g4.]
;W[gn];B[hn];W[gp];B[ho];W[fp]C[A: W succeded reducing the lower side from the left with some extra points in sente.]
;B[gq];W[gm]
(;B[pf]C[This must  have been wrong because white made huge points going to the center with walls on both sides

A: I agree, B57 would have been much more effective at P13, the capping move]
;W[og]C[A: This feels very good for W now.]
(;B[of]C[A: A little submissive. Maybe it would be better for B to thrust at Q13]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[mg];B[jh]C[I did not recover from this move.  But with a 4 stone wall I thought I should have been able to connect.

A: I agree];W[jf]
(;B[ig]C[A: this kosumi only makes W64 stronger. To connect to your 4stone wall, you can J14 or L14.]
;W[if];B[hf]C[this does not work];W[hg];B[hh]C[A: If you cannot capture, don't atari! This is very, very bad.]
;W[gg]C[Now W64-W66 work even better thanks to the potential connections at H15 and M14. B69 turned into a thankyou move.]
;B[fh]C[A: this does not work, you are creating more weaknesses for W' advantage.]
;W[gh];B[hi];W[gi];B[hj];W[il]C[Then I tried to reach in this direction unsuccessfully.  I guess the game is over now.

A: I agree, even if you get through connecting it will be in exchange for W's profit.]
;B[gd];W[lf];B[fe]C[good idea];W[ee];B[ge];W[ed]
(;B[de]C[A: B should keep the turmoil and directly cut at E14]
;W[dc];B[eb]
(;W[db]C[W should have connected at E14, and keep the win];B[fg]
C[A: very good];W[gf];B[ef];W[fb];B[ej]C[A: great move!];W[ek]

(;B[he]C[A: but this is the wrong follow-up, you should atari at G10 to save your center group instead of one stone. Now you loose the game.]
