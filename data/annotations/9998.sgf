C[Hello,

I'm Joonas, EGF 1 kyu, and I'll be reviewing this game mostly for white. Hope the comments are helpful. Let's get started!]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[ho]C[This move surprised me, but it seemed like the natural reply was to play the two-point extension.

Joonas: Well, this is not often seen in first dozen moves or so, but is a standard technique to build strength or attack.]

(;W[kq]C[The two-space extension looks OK.]
(;B[nq]
(;W[mp]C[I guess I was trying to get into the center but I'm not sure this move was the right idea.

Joonas: This looks OK. Just a simple jump at A would've done as well, see variation.]
;B[np]
(;W[qf]LB[mp:2][np:1]C[I think if you play N4, you should continue there as well, otherwise you should not play it at all. Now it looks you changed your mind in the middle of a plan.

Good thing to consider here: If you would have played R14 immediately without N4 and black would play O4, would you then play N4?]
;B[nc]
(;W[qc]LB[rd:A]C[I think this was a mistake. If I'd wanted the corner, maybe it would have been better to play the slide at A instead?

I think the invasion helped him a lot more than it helped me.

Joonas: In beginning, you should not try to invade this small corner -- with O17 in place, it will be hard for white and black will gain much more outside than you get in the corner. So slide is much preferred.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe]C[Black is very happy to build his right side potential here.]

(;W[pc];B[od]
(;W[di]C[Was it worth taking gote for this? Maybe I should have played some sente moves elsewhere first?

Joonas: Your corner in top right looks to be in danger. Are you sure you can play elsewhere? Instead of this, you should play P18.]

(;B[cf]LB[fc:B][mo:A]C[Thils looks like the wrong side. I'd play A or B as black instead of this.]
;W[ce]C[Good choice!];B[fc]C[I wasn't expecting him to do this.

Joonas: Yes this looks surprising, but might be better for black to abandon his not-so-good C14 stone and take top side.]
;W[df]C[Since he didn't extend after my kick, I felt compelled to follow up. But maybe this wasn't the best play?

I could have taken the corner, or a big point elsewhere, and then continued to attack his weak stone if it extended.

Joonas: This does reduce complications, build your left side and top is still open for attack, so not a bad choice in my opinion.]
;B[cc]C[This is just a silly move from black.];W[dc];B[db]
(;W[bc]LB[ad:2][ae:3][be:1]C[How many points are there in the corner for white with this move? 3? Compare to variation.]
;B[bb]LB[fc:A][bd:B][qk:C]C[Here you might still do like black with A and change your plan, as black has only a few points to gain with B. You could just play C now.]
;W[bd];B[pj]LB[bc:A][pc:C][mp:B]C[I wasn't too happy when he took this point.

Joonas: Yes, this is big. Because of A, black reduced white corner in sente. White looks to be in trouble: His tenuki after B and C has created two weak groups, and white left and black right side look comparable, while black has top potential.]

(;W[qn]LB[ob:A]C[Brave plan, and probably needed as white is behind. A is of course very large as well.

Another plan would be now to attack black bottom group and hope your own group becomes more solid after attack, then you would not have two weak groups here.]
;B[qo];W[nn]C[Nice and light move!]
(;B[ql]C[This is a bit unambitious move from black.];W[ol]LB[ml:1]
[ln:2][mo:A]C[The direction of this one feels wrong.

I think main issue is that black A will split your groups. You should play a move that helps against that. 1 or calm 2 (maybe too calm) would accomplish that.]

(;B[nj]LB[fe:A]C[Not as aggressive to variation, but still very solid. Note that black A will create a new framework on top for black.]

(;W[mk]LB[lj:A]C[Is this the right direction? I considered capping at A but I was scared that my weak group wouldn't succeed at making an eye in the center.

Joonas: Yes, locally this looks like it is helping your stones to live. Problem is, that you'll soon need to invade new black areas, which makes the game quite hard for black.

A would be disastrous, see variation.];B[mj];W[lk];B[ki]C[Black definitely has the lead, but the upside is that your bottom group looks more alive and connected.]

(;W[lj]C[This was a thank-you move, wasn't it?

Joonas: Yes, this move has an obvious answer, which has no upside for white, but makes black more solid. :)]
;B[li];W[ro]C[This is quite small. If black answers at S4, do you connect?]
;B[rp];W[po];B[qp];W[qm]C[I do like this move, though. Suddenly black bottom is reduced a bit. Still, reducing K16 area is more urgent.]
;B[rn]C[Horrible move for black, this is like 2 points in gote.]
;W[rm];B[sn]
(;W[sm];B[so]
(;W[er]LB[fm:A]C[This is big considering the corner. Not sure if A would be better, hard for black to build base here. Quite good move in any case.]
;B[fr];W[hm]LB[fm:A]C[I also considered the move at A.

Joonas: A is better, letting black get A makes this last white stone quite useless.]
;B[hi]SQ[if][jf][ig][jg]C[Best answer to this expansion of moyo would be to invade the top -- it would make this move quite small if successful, giving only 10 points at maximum in the center.]
;W[fm]C[Good! Now black looks to be in trouble.];B[jm];W[in]
C[Excellent. I have trouble understanding K7.];B[jn];W[io];B[im]
;W[hk]LB[ik:A][hl:B][mo:C]C[Would it have been better to play at A?

No, I would have played at B which threatens cutting black, and then maybe invaded the top and hoped black will not cut at C...]
;B[ik];W[jk]LB[ij:A][il:B]C[I was going to say the black can just play A to prevent white cut at B, but...]
;B[ij]LB[jj:A]C[What if white now plays A?]
(;W[il]C[This is another thank-you move. This eliminates any complications from black.]
;B[jl];W[hl];B[kk]LB[mo:A]C[Black is now connected and white cannot get into center. Furthermore, black A again starts to look worrying.]
;W[kl]C[....];B[jj];W[gg]LB[hc:C][lc:D][gd:B][lm:A]C[This stone was an attempt at reduction. It didn't totally fail, but I feel like I could have found something more effective.

Joonas: This is exactly the time to play the reduction. If you'd continue around A, that would be too small.

I'd consider B-D as alternate plans. However, you still need to play at P18...]
;B[hf]LB[gf:A]C[This shoulder block is easy to imagine further... See variation from A. This is not enough for white, so you'll need to think something else.]

(;W[hg]C[Too slow, see variations.];B[ig];W[gf];B[he];W[gi]
LB[ob:B][gd:C][rj:A][lr:D]C[I guess this earned me points but it was gote. I have no idea if this was right or not.

I played it mostly because I was scared of what would happen if he pushed through first.

Joonas: You have only about 8 points to make here. A-C are all much bigger, and possibly even D.]
;B[fe]
(;W[ef]C[This makes you a lot of points in the side, but is smaller than A.

However, I think actually now white left side starts to look big, so if you can get A and good endgame, it still might be enough.]
;B[jo];W[ip];B[jp];W[jq];B[lp];W[mq]C[After black plays A, this move does not help your group that much.]

(;B[mr]C[not the best move from black.];W[lq]
(;B[no]C[Just plain bad move from black. White is almost connected.]
;W[mo]
(;B[pn];W[pm];B[oo];W[mn]C[Great result for white, good play!]
;B[nk];W[nl]LB[ob:A]C[Still, A is left unplayed...];B[sk];W[rk]
;B[rj];W[qk];B[qj];W[pk]LB[ob:A][se:C][lr:B]C[This is like 2 points. You should reduce black elsewhere, like A-C]
;B[ok];W[ob]C[Finally! :)];B[nb];W[se];B[sf];W[sd];B[rf];W[ge]
;B[gd];W[hh];B[ih];W[hj]C[This looks quite small, but does reduce risk of surprises]
;B[ii]C[Now that white got to live around A without any losses, secured area at B and lived with C, game is suddenly very good for white. Great work, white had big trouble in the middle game, but several slow black moves let you catch up!]
;W[lr];B[nr];W[lo]LB[na:B][sl:A][lm:C]C[What is this? A-C is bigger]
;B[kp];W[km];B[kn];W[ln];B[kj];W[ll];B[hp]LB[gq:B][iq:A]C[Good way to think these "I'm trying to live" problems: What is alive if cut? Definitely A group, so you might just reduce black eyespace at B or C]

(;W[dr];B[dq];W[cq];B[ep]
(;W[co];B[es];W[cr];B[en];W[em];B[do]LB[cp:A]C[Instead of taking the ko, should I connect at A?

Joonas: Yes, then you win. :)]
(;W[eo];B[ml];W[mm];B[do];W[cm]LB[cp:A]C[Here I decided to connect but I don't think it's the right connection. I think this was a really costly mistake.

Joonas: Yeah.];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[dp];B[ff];W[fg];B[cp];W[cn]
;B[bq];W[dp];B[qb];W[ra];B[cp];W[ap]C[This was bad.

Joonas: No it's just a ko threat :)];B[aq];W[dp];B[rb]C[Now you should count that this top right group is smaller than the ko and ignore...]

(;W[qa]LB[pa:A]C[I should have played at A, correct?

Joonas: Or T18];B[cp];W[go]C[This threat was much too small.]
;B[ao]C[I guess I should have resigned once I lost the corner.

Joonas: Yes, now it looks quite impossible to win.];W[gp];B[br]
;W[am]LB[na:B][bn:A]C[I have no idea why I played here instead of at A.

I'm in time trouble by this point and starting to get flustered.

Joonas: I think such a move is sometimes seen in endgame. Not a bad move. of course B is slightly bigger.]
;B[eo];W[fn];B[bn];W[bm];B[sj];W[on];B[po];W[na];B[ma];W[oa]
;B[mb];W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[fd];W[hd]C[I don't know what I was thinking with this one. It doesn't make any sense in retrospect. Maybe I played it because I needed time?]

;B[ns];W[ls];B[oc];W[pb];B[sb];W[ac];B[ba];W[ko]C[I wasted a ko threat here because I was about to lose on time.]

(;B[id]LB[gc:A];W[gb];B[hb];W[ea];B[da];W[aa];B[fa];W[ga];B[gc]
;W[ea];B[ha];W[ca];B[tt];W[tt]C[Alright, quite an interesting game! A short summary:

There was a big life-and-death situation at top right for most of the game, if black would've seen it, the game would have been over.

Otherwise, white invasion around R6 with another weak group at bottom side made the game very hard for white, but black was not able to take the advantage.

White was a bit timid in reducing black center, and it became huge. However, white got similar territory on the side, and black missed his opportunity to attack the very weak stones around O6, which let white take the lead.

However, white missed several key moments on the bottom left, and once black got the go there, it was hard game to win for white, as black had better threats. Only the surprise capture of D18 black stones made the game a bit close in the end.

If you can find calm moves in the beginning that strengthen your own groups, I think you'll have better control of the situation in fuseki, which should lead into profitable fights in the middle game. Avoid invading areas near your weak groups, and most importantly, do tsumego (or play a lot) to learn avoid small moves or thank-you moves. With this, I think you have the potential to improve quite quickly.

Thanks and all the best in your future games!])
