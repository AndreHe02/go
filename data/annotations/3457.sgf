C[Hi, I'm Tim, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'll start my comments with 
**, so that you can tell them apart from the conversation during the game.  
If you have any questions, you can reach me at 
timkington@gmail.com.];B[pq];W[dd]C[H20Dragon [18k?\]: my rank is wrong, please be gentle]
;B[dp]C[Aradiel [18k\]: o.k. I'll try];W[pd];B[qo];W[jd];B[cj]
C[** I would prefer a move at K4 or K3, because it's an extension from 
both of your corners.];W[fq];B[kq]C[** This is definitely too loose.  It's not close enough to threaten 
the white stone.  Also, it's too close to your corner on the right -it's 
inefficient.  You should have played one more point to the left, then it's 
the right distance from your right-hand corner, and it's also threatening 
the white stone.];W[iq]C[** See, with your stone placed where it is, White can make the ideal 
two-point extension, and now he has nothing to worry about.]
;B[eq];W[er];B[dr];W[ep];B[dq];W[gr];B[eo];W[gp];B[pj]C[** Excellent.  Keep your eye on the whole board situation as much as 
you can.  White didn't get a great result out of his invasion.  He gave you 
extremely solid corner territory, influence up the left side, and all he got 
was a few points of territory, and a group that you may be able to attack 
sometime in the future.];W[pg];B[cg];W[ce];B[df];W[ee];B[ef]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf];B[go]C[** This is the right idea, but I would probably play one point 
higher, at G6.  This is a good move because you're putting pressure on the 
white group while expanding your territory.  When you can find moves like 
this, make them immediately.  Also, White can't cut at D5 because of his 
stone that's in atari.];W[ho];B[fp]C[** This is a mistake.  You MUST play at G6.  Look at the difference 
in the size of your territory on the left when you get G6 vs White getting 
to play there.];W[gn];B[fo];W[in]C[** White could be much more aggressive here.  He should probably try 
something like jumping to G8.];B[fn]C[** This is too slow.  You should jump out ahead of White, probably 
to F7.];W[gm];B[fm];W[gl];B[fk]C[** That's better.];W[fl];B[el]
;W[hk]C[** White's last move didn't do much.  It was a mistake, giving you 
sente.  At times like this, it's good to try to estimate the score to help 
decide what to do.  Here I would be trying to decide whether or not to 
invade the top.  In this case, you have 50 points on the left, and about 30 
on the right.  White has potential for a lot more than 80 at the top, so you 
need to get in there.  There's the easy corner invasion at the 3-3 point, 
but that would give him a lot of solid territory on the top edge.  If you 
can manage to make an invasion in sente, and then play around L5, that would 
be a good plan, but it's hard to keep sente when you invade.  The other 
thing you might try is playing at K4, which threatens to cut White's group 
apart at H4, and then jump to L6.  That would make your potential territory 
on the right a lot bigger.];B[fj]C[** This is way too small to play right now.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[rj];B[rk];W[si];B[pk]LB[qk:A]TR[pj][qj]C[** This is a mistake.  It makes very bad 
shape.  The three marked stones make what is called an empty triangle.  The 
triangle is empty because there is not a white stone at A.  If there were, 
then the shape would not be bad.  Also, you don't need to defend here right 
now.];W[ko]C[** Playing here would have been much bigger.];B[lo]
;W[km];B[lm];W[kp];B[lp];W[jq];B[es]C[** The value of this move is really small.  In general, you want to 
try to play the biggest moves on the board first, and you want to play the 
ones the other player must answer before ones he can ignore.  This is both 
small and ignorable.  White should play in the upper right corner to make it 
stronger.];W[fr];B[fs]C[** This is even smaller and more ignorable than the last move.  
Remember to think about the whole board.];W[gs]C[** Luckily for you, White is in an answering mood.]
;B[ds]C[** This sequence has gained maybe 4 points, but you lost sente.  If 
White plays in the upper right corner, it's worth about 30 points, because 
you probably won't be able to invade anymore.  That's at least a 26 point 
loss for you.];W[kr];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr];W[ls]C[H20Dragon [18k?\]: would you be interested in teaching with editing 
after?];B[ms];W[js];B[kn];W[jn];B[ln]C[** This was another bad exchange for you.  You gained maybe 2 
points, but gave up sente again.  Sente is IMPORTANT.];W[kl]
;B[ll];W[lk];B[kk];W[jk];B[kj];W[mk];B[lj];W[nj];B[mj];W[nh]
;B[nk];W[oi];B[oj];W[ni]C[** Check the score again.  You've got 50 on the left and an enormous 
55 or so on the right.  If you just invade the upper right corner, you 
shouldn't have too much trouble winning.  O17 is probably the point.  See 
variation.]
(;B[mi]LB[kg:A][lg:B]C[** This move is very slow, and another empty 
triangle.  If you want to play around here, you should play at A or B.]

C[** This is a big mistake.  White should cut.  See variation.  You 
needed to play at S8.]
(;W[sj]
(;B[ql]C[** Another mistake.  You can kill some stones.  See variation.]
;W[rh];B[gk];W[hl];B[qc]C[** You should have done this long ago.  Now that White has a strong 
wall below, he can kill this invasion if he plays properly.  Still, all is 
not lost - if the invasion lives, you should win the game.  I would probably 
prefer O17, as it gives you a little more wiggle room.]
(;W[pb]C[** If White's going to play like this, you're in trouble.  Most 
players of 12k and above would play the sequence in the variation, and you 
would live easily.

You should try to keep in mind that you are trying to make two eyes.  Your 
stones wound up stringy, and then they're easy to kill.  The easiest place 
to make eyes is in the corner, so your first move should protect the corner.

board in mind at once.  If you had invaded the upper right earlier, you 
would have easily won the game.  You should also try to read out whether or 
not you need to protect certain areas.  There were several times where you 
played a defensive move when you didn't need one.])
