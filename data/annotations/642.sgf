C[i played white in that game.   i added some questions at the moves where i couldn't figure out a better alternative.

it would be great if you could give me answers to these problems.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[qj];W[nc]SQ[nc];B[pb]C[how should i respond to this move?

The simplest is to just extend along the top to L17. This move gives your O17 stone a base.   
Black needs to make another move on the right to gen much territory, so black's profit here is too big.]

(;W[jc]C[This extension may be a little wide.  With the thick position on the right you should be more conservative.]
;B[hc];W[ld]C[is this move good?

Yes, given the K17 extension, you need another move here.  If you ignore it, M17 by black would be very painful.  This is why I think L17 is better than K17.  Play conservativly near your opponent's strength.]
;B[og]
(;W[ed]C[i wanted to destroy a potential corner enclosure. is this move good?

It is OK, but I would prefer to play something like C10.  Suppose Black plays E17, taking about 18 pts of real territory. Then you can take K4 and make a moyo on the bottom. You should be able to get at least 18 pts out of the C10, K4 combination to make up for the upper left.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[db];W[gc];B[hd]
(;W[gd]C[I don't think you want to make the H17 group any stronger.  That should be the target of your attack, so you should try to build strength elsewhere.  How about C15?]
;B[hf];W[ge];B[he];W[gf];B[ig]
(;W[lf]C[is this move good?

This is the right idea, but you should probably play M12 instead.  The M16 group can always connect at H18 or live with M18 if you get desparate.]
;B[lg]
(;W[kf]C[Much too passive.  Hane at N13 instead.  Don't let black connect here.]
;B[kg];W[mg]C[Now the L13/L14 exchange looks good for black.]
;B[mh];W[ng];B[nh];W[of];B[pg];W[pf];B[qf];W[qe];B[pe];W[oe]
C[Better to just connect at O14.  Then black has to worry about the cutting points at R13 and M12.]

;W[qd];B[qc];W[oc];B[rd];W[jp]C[what about that move?

It will be VERY difficult to make territory here with all the thickness black has above.]
;B[jj]
(;W[gh]C[This move doesn't do much.  If you think G17 group is in trouble, just connect at H18. If not, then take territory or a big point somewhere.]
