C[Hi,

This is a very peaceful game. But having played using black, I don't know where I went terriblely wrong, so in the end, I lost by 10+ points.

Thank you very much for your help and time.];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd]

;W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[ic];B[kc]LB[cj:A]C[This is a strange move. It presumably is made to attack the white group, but W's response stabilizes it immediately in sente. In addition, it is an extension before a shimari, contrary to usual.  Finishing the joseki in the upper left with an extension to 'A' makes more sense and helps nullify the W stone in the lower left.  The top is not urgent as W has no good move there.]
;W[ie];B[qe];W[ch]C[This move is too aggresive given the strength of the B group, although it seems natural to punish B for not extending down the left.]

(;B[ff]LB[dk:A]C[I would prefer to see B pincer the white stone,.probably at A.  See the variation for one possible sequence..]
;W[eg];B[ef];W[ge]
(;B[dj]LB[ei:A][cn:B]C[This seems to miss the spot. The B stone is isolated if W responds at 'A'. I would consider an approach at 'B', expecting the variation shown.]
;W[cm]C['];B[dh]LB[ci:A]C['A' seems better - attacks W while preventign the disconnection.]
;W[ci]
(;B[di]LB[cj:A]C[B should block at 'A'. W will trouble getting out.  One possibilty is shown in the variation.]
;W[cj];B[ck];W[bk];B[bl];W[cl];B[dk];W[bj];B[dq]LB[dg:B][lq:A]
C[I think 'A' is bigger.  Because of the potential cut at 'B' W can respon to this by playing a center game, which also protects against a B play at 'A'.   There are many other possibilities in the lower left which B loses by playing this move.]
;W[cq]LB[dg:B][lq:A]C[W should play to take the outside.  Outside strength would indirectly protect agsint B 'A' and also allow W to aim at the cut at 'B'.]
;B[eq];W[cr];B[ep];W[do];B[iq];W[kq]LB[dg:C][pk:D][gq:A][lq:B]
TR[iq][kq]C[The triangle exchange leaves B open to an invasion at 'A, but if B defends he must do so in gote.  MAybe B should have gone all out and played 'B' instead of extending.  This would precipitate a fight but that maybe what black needs to allow him to protect against 'C' and attack 'D' in a roundabout manner.]
;B[io];W[cg]C[Very ad move.  This eliminates all the ajo of the cut.]
;B[dg]C[B should be very happy. With this move he takes a comfortble lead.]
;W[cf];B[dd];W[fd];B[ce]TR[dd][fd]C[If B isa going to play here anyway then the triangle exchange is bad for him. PLaying this move directly is perhaps better.  W could not cut.]
;W[oc];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb];W[mc];B[ke]C[Because this does not preent a W connection underneath it is not very effective. 'A' probably works better.]
;W[me];B[kg];W[pf];B[jd]LB[jc:A]C[This is gote. To prvent th connection uinderneath in sente B must play 'A']
;W[qf]C[Huge.];B[pe];W[of];B[id];W[hd]
(;B[hc]LB[nd:A][ko:B]C[This move makes no sense to me.
  Black can play 'A' if he wants to try something in this area.  'B' would also be a good point]
;W[hb];B[gc];W[jb];B[kb];W[gb];B[rf]C[B's corner is in no danger.  This move just helps W strength himself.]
;W[rg];B[re];W[lf];B[kf];W[hg];B[nd]LB[lf:A]C[Too late once 'A' is played.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[nf];B[mh];W[oi];B[mg];W[mf];B[mj]C[I'm not sure whether B is trying to escape of thinks he is attacking W.  Assuming W lives on the side then B is just playing dame points]

;W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[kr];W[nq];B[kp];W[rq];B[qp]LB[hi:A]C[Black is definitely behind in soid territory and the game is turning against him, but he has sente and a lot of central thickness so a win is still possible. This move, which is gote is just not good enough because the B group is not in immediate danger.  I would be looking for a play around 'A']
;W[mm];B[dn];W[cn];B[eo]C[Too small. It does not threaten W at all.]
;W[em];B[el];W[ih]C[This is the deciding move.  B now has almost no prospects in the center and so will lose the game now.  The rest of the game is just yose.  Given the strength of the players B has no chance to catch up.]
