C[Both sizes made tactical mistakes, and missed tactical opportunities, but no more than should be expected at this level.   
White missed the middle game strategy of attacking a weak black group.

In the endgame, black got to most of the big points on the edge first, and gained many points.

The lead changed many times.  An interesting game.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pq];W[qo]C[It is more common to take the empty corner.  This move invites a pincer, so black might take the initiative.   But if you don't like to play against the Chinese style opening, or you feel you can fight better in the many pincer josekis, it is a reasonable choice.]
;B[qp]C[Since there is a black stone at Q16, it is better to pincer the white approach move.  A pincer has two purposes, since it attacks white and makes an extension from the upper corner at the same time.]
;W[po];B[nq];W[qk]C[Good.  A reasonable sequence after the R4 move.]
;B[dd];W[df]C[The low approach at C14 is more usual.  The high approach means a small local disadvantage, so you should have something in mind to get compensation for using it.]
;B[cn];W[cl]C[Good.  Pincer and extension from the D14 stone.]
;B[en];W[fp]C[It's not clear to me that this is better than F3.  F4 works better at attacking the two black stones above, but it wants a later extension along the lower side to complete the shape.  Since the black stone at O3 is so strong, this later extension will not have any effect on the black group.

It's a general rule that if a side has a very solid, 3rd line group, it's small.  You should profer to play on an edge with a 4th line stone or a weak group.  Since you don't want to play later on the lower edge, F3 might be better.]

(;B[dl]C[This strengthens white.  D9 is more common, to make some thickness in the center.]
;W[dk];B[el]
(;W[dj]C[This move looks strange.  If black later plays at C7, he will get an eye at D7, and white will have to answer at B8.  When white plays at C7, he is threatening to cut, so black has to defend.

So C7 is the key point here.  It is sente for both sides, and it makes a difference of one eye to the black group.   
C7 also defends the curring point at C9.  This kind of urgent shape will jump out at you when you get stronger.]

(;B[ce]C[This helps white make a solid territory here, and gives up sente. But the corner is big, so it's OK.   
I would play C14.

I'd want to play C7 right away to stabilize my group.];W[cf]
;B[bf];W[bg];B[be];W[ch];B[fc]
(;W[lc]C[this should be at L17 i think

Correct.  When you invade in a wide space, think about
having a two space extension in each direction.

The other option for invasion is O17.   SInce F17 is on the 3rd line, a pincer is not so interesting for black.

The final option to consider is an approach on the right side. It's the move I would pick.]
;B[ic]
(;W[oc]C[because here i make my base too close to his corner and can't help strengthening him.

This is a move you should avoid if you can.  I'd play almost anywhere else around here.  There are no joseki here :)  But there are some things to think about...

You could just take the corner.  It's big, and your stone at M17 should still be able to run away.  
You could attach at Q17.  If he takes the corner, you get a better result.  If he plays on the outside, it will be a fight.]

;B[ng];W[me];B[og]
(;W[jd]C[This move is small.  Your white group is stable already, so it doesn't need a defensive move here.  The black group is also stable, so this is not an attacking move.  It only makes a few points of territory.

Now would be a good time to attack the black group in the lower left.]
;B[id];W[ie];B[he];W[if];B[hf]C[You should answer the last move.  Your two stones at J15 and J14 have only 3 liberties, and there is a cut at K15 to worry about.  Without another move here, black should be able to get some stones in the center.

Your middle game plan should be based on the relative strength of the groups.  Since there is a weak black group in the lower left, you should be planning to get something by attacking it. Since it will have to run away, you want the stones facing the center, so you can attack it more strongly.]
;W[fe];B[hg]C[Good move for black.  It gets strength in the center to help the lower left group, and aims at cutting through the knight's move at E14.]

(;W[jq]C[This extension is too long, since the black group in the lower left is so strong.]

(;B[kq]C[This strengthens white, and removes the later invasion at H3. It's not so good.

I would strengthen the lower left group with C7, then invade. It won't turn out well for white.]
;W[kp];B[lq];W[jp]C[this seemed necessary, but he exploited my weakness at E4 in the next move

Absolutely necessary.];B[eq]C[
If you were thinking of the lower side as territory, this seems like a big loss, but it's not.  The 3-3 point was always open, and your extension to K3 left an invasion point behind at H3, so the lower side was never your territory.

Instead think of this as a golden opportunity to build thickness to attack the weak black group above.]

(;W[ep]C[should this have been at F3?

No!  Your move is correct, since you want to attack the black strones above.  F3 leaves all kinds of messy tactics behind, and will help the upper group.

It's not easy to find a good sequence here, but you should keep your mind on attacking the black group at e6.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[fq];W[gq];B[cr]
(;W[fr]C[It seems that this move will let black end with sente, since you will want to defend your f2 stone, so playing at the other end looks better.]
;B[bq];W[cp];B[er]C[Keep the groups separated.]
(;W[es];B[dr]
(;W[gr]C[no, no, no....

You must keep the outside group seprated from the corner, so you can attack it.]
;B[bp]C[Letting black connect the weak group to the corner is very bad. You lose your target.

Actually, there is an interesting tactic here after you play at C7, but still...]

(;W[gn];B[ig]
(;W[jf]TR[jf][if][ie]C[This is bad shape, since it gives black another forcing move. When you will make this triangle shape, think about jumping instead (to L14).  It's usually better.]
;B[jg];W[kf];B[cm]C[Black gets the key point here first.];W[bl]
;B[bm]
(;W[gl]TR[fe][jg][ig]C[is this better than N5 or M4?

This move would be ideal, if it had an affect on the black group. Then black would have to defend, and you caould get two moves in a row in the center.

Now it's hard for me to see how you can get many points in the center.

Black is thick at K13, since you didn't play J13 earlier.  NOw you can see how much more important the moves in the center are than your move at F15.  His thickness means that he can easily reduce your center no matter where you play.  YOu need too many moves to surround it.

Still, if you do want to surround the center, I would start with N5, since it makes a deeper framework.]
;B[ij]C[Black can come in much deeper if he wants since he has seveal ways out.]
;W[ik];B[jk];W[hk];B[fg];W[de]C[This move threatens the corner, so black needs to defend,
and he can defend with sente.]
(;B[lp]C[This move is very slow.  It doesn't defend or attack or take territory, or reduce much.  Playing at K8 is much bigger (assuming no need to defend the upper left).]

If you can't cut him off, you should just play Q7 when it is bigger than other endgame plays.]
;B[oo];W[pp];B[oq];W[lo];B[mn];W[mo];B[np];W[no]C[stupid rookie blunder

Again, you need to check your groups with 2 liberties.  Seeing things like this will become automatic with a little more practice.]
;B[qn];W[nn];B[lm];W[om];B[pn];W[cc]C[got back in the game here.  was this a good move, though, assuming our level of play?

It's good if it works :)  If it fails you don't lose much, and you are behind, so you have to try something.  I don't think white can live here with perfect play, but it's your best chance to get back into the game.]

(;B[cd]C[Making a solid conenction is usually good.  In this case, I don't think black needs to conenct, but it is a little tricky.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[ec]
(;B[fb]C[Good.  If black just connects, white will have an easier time. Actually after the connection, white should still die, but it is hard to read out in a game.]
;W[eb]
(;B[ea]C[This is from the wrong side.  When White plays at D19 it helps white make eye shape, and there is the cut at F16.  Black should conenct or play at B17 instead.]
;W[fd];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[da]
(;B[fa]TR[fc][fb]C[This move is very bad.  If white captures the stone at E19, it doesn't help him live, since the eye is false.  And conencting here reduces the liberties of the F18 group so it will be captured.

Black should play in the corner at B19 to make his group alive, and the two markes stones can never be captured.  So white is dead.]
;W[gc]C[Capturing these stones gives white a very good result here.  Black missed many chances to kill the white stones.]
;B[ba];W[gb];B[gd]C[Now the game is very close, and white has sente to start the big endgame points.  It's important to play the sente points first, then the biggest endgame points.

Some of them are shown in the variations.]
(;W[jb];B[jc];W[kc];B[ib];W[ja];B[ia];W[kb]C[This was big, but not sente.  If you play first at P18, then the game sequence you will end up with about 5 more points, which should be enough to win.]

;B[ef];W[ee];B[eh];W[dg];B[eg];W[ei];B[hh];W[gi];B[fk];W[fl]
;B[ek];W[gk]C[This whole sequence in the center was not good.  It's hard to make points in the center in  the endgame.  Usually the big moves are around the edge, not the center.

In this case, white moved first in the center, and lose sente, and only gained one point at C13.  A move at L2 also loses sente, but is much bigger.]
;B[mi]TR[jg][mi]C[This was big here.  I wonder if there were points in the past where i could have played here.

This is also not as big as it looks, since it is in the center. You can respond at M12, so black didn't gain anything.

A way to find M12 is to look at the territory Black is trying to enclose, find the line that connects the two stones making the enclosure, and play near that line.  The stones at N11 and K13  mark the boundary of blacks center territory, so M12 is clearly better than N12, provided it can't be cut off.]

(;W[mh];B[lh];W[lg];B[kg];W[mg]C[This way black gained some points in sente.]
;B[na];W[mb];B[jr]C[Ouch.  Black gets this big endgame point as well.]
;W[ir];B[kr]C[Since black got the big endgame points at P18 and K2, and made some undeserved territory in the center, black is ahead again.]
;W[ml]
(;B[ll]C[Now black makes another tactical mistake and gives up a lot in the center.]
;W[li];B[lj];W[kh];B[ki]
(;W[lh]C[I'm thinking I should have fought this ko.

I think so.  You are still behind without any clear prospects for catching up.  And if you win the ko, you will capture all the black stones, and win by a huge margin.  So black needs gigantic ko threats.  Maybe you didn't realize that if you win the ko, the whole black center group dies.  When you have a ko where you risk a little to gain a lot, go for it.]

(;W[do]C[ugh.  anyway, had to resign here.  I had counted it out to being very close, 1-5 points, so i tried to save the ko.  stupid.

You are correct, that it is a very close game.  It looks to my like black has a very small win, perhaps 2 points, if you lose the Ko.  So you do have to try to save the ko.  But first you need to see the ladder.  It's important, whenever there is a group with two liberties, to check the ladder and make sure it can't be immediately captured.   
You should connect at G4, then fight the ko.  It looks like black has more ko threats, but you still need to try.]
