C[Hello Dear Reviewer!
I played this game after long brake and still thougt i playing around 4k. In this game i played White.

After W32 i was clearly ahead. Please show me how to deal with rude invasions.

Thank you!

Hi. I am Paul Ohmart and play on KGS as vorpal 1d.];B[pd]C[Asvas [?\]: Hi gg!
kpa555 [4k\]: hi];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk];W[nc]C[FYI: I believe that this approach is not favored so much today though it was popular in the past.
It should be playable and is certainly not a reason for winning or loosing.]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[pc]C[Wrong direction for B.];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[qe];W[re];B[og]LB[po:A][qo:B]C[Before deciding the next move let's asses the position.

I would say that the top right quadrant is played out. There are, of course, moves to be made by both sides but the groups are settled.

The bottom right favors black since he was there first.
You could enter around A or B (or even a line higher) but you are going to be fighting in black's sphere of influence and that fight will necessairly favor black.

I would say that the left side is the most important part of the board at this point as it is the most open.
The next is the bottom.

I can't say which is better. The left side works better to use the white stones but the bottom prevents black from getting a double wing.]
(;W[po];B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr]LB[pn:A]TR[qk]C[I like the idea of playing the avalanche here and would do so myself in this position.

My first instince would be to play A but I don't think that is the correct point.

The reason for my saying that is that the marked black stone is low and close to the corner.
If black plays at A I think he will be a bit overconcentrated so I would like to find a way to emphasize the bottom and left sides which is what the avalanche is all about in this position.

But... how to do that?]
(;W[pn]SQ[ql][rl][sl][qm][rm][sm][qn][rn][sn]C[This move threatens to make dame of the squared intersections but I don't think they are very important.

If black protects them then that is great and this move is powerful for the left and bottom but if I were black I would abandon that area. For white to play down is sort of just a gote yose move. It doesn't get the white group eye shape or hurt the eye shape of the corner group.]
(;B[or];W[nq]C[I don't like this for black. He makes a 2nd - 3rd line exchange (better for you) and your move helps the left side while his is locked away from the game on the edge. It also makes it more difficult to find a good point to enter on the bottom and your group is now much stronger.]
;B[qn]
(;W[pm]LB[ce:A][de:B][cf:C][df:D][ck:E][fq:F]C[As black I would play one fo the letter'd points for sure. 

I can't say which is best but I'm pretty sure they are all better than R7.]
;B[qm]TR[or]C[So the dust seems to have settled from the lower right corner and things have worked out very well for you.

 Whither now?

The eye is drawn to the bottom due to the presence of the white stones in the lower right but black delta makes it difficult to do a lot there.

Black can push in, monkey jump or play something like L3 to threaten to connect.

So I would treat the lower side as of less importance than the left.]
(;W[fq]C[TO REVIEWER:
What was bigger - F3 or C15?

I'd say about the same.
C15 protects the corner but the influence of that wall is aimed up the top side where black is strong so it will be difficult for you to take full advantage of that wall.

F3 is directed toward the bottom side but that is open at the bottom.

This open at the bottom thing is a siren song that entices you to think you will get to cover at O2 but it is much better to construct the position so your opponent has to play there (making almost no terrotory for himself) while you get the big open areas on the left.]
;B[de]C[Here I like the idea of trying to play a poicer. The top side is already developed and is not an interesting area any more. The action is on the open left side.]
(;W[fc];B[nd]C[Oh my....];W[cg];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd]C[Your corner play is certainly strong but I would be trying to think of how to maximize the bottom left part of the board where your influence dominates.]
(;W[bb];B[hc]C[TO REVIEWER:
Which is the best way to attack B weak stones?]
(;W[eg];B[fe];W[gd];B[ge];W[hd]
(;B[ic]
(;W[he]TR[hd]C[I think this goes in the wrong direction.

Your delta stones influence is to the right top which is a played out area and you are forcing black to play directly into the center which is where the action is.

There is always the possibility of forcing him even more but I think the earlier variation of pushing at G13 is fine.

You don't want to kill him, just make him wish he were dead.]
;B[gg]
(;W[dj]C[The large open areas where you will make territory are on the bottom and left. This is a bit cramped.]
;B[hf]SQ[jd][kd][ld][je][ke][le][me][jf][kf][lf][mf][nf][kg]
[lg][mg][ng]C[Black already has the territory on the top and can only make at most about 16 points here. I wouldn't worry about keeping him from getting that while you get the rest of the board in exchange.]
(;W[je];B[jd];W[if];B[ig];W[jg];B[ih]C[Again you are forcing him to go in the direction in which he wants to move.]
;W[co]C[TO REVIEWER:
This was right?

Good point.];B[jq]LB[lq:A]TR[hf][gg][ig][ih]C[Given the presence of the marked black stones it will be difficult for you to capture this stone.

If you had forced him to connect to the top right and covered these points yourself then you could play at A to make life very hard on him.]

Which is the best way to attack and split B stones?

The three marked white stones are the weakest so I would help them.

It is most important that the hunter does not become the hunted.]

Notice that you have a lot of openings in your moyo but that black has gotten no points for his last four moves and while he may be able to live if he invades on one side he won't get much terrotory while you will make the other side large.]

If you know black would answer you are better off playing it but that is not a good approach for you as he could come to his senses and play on the left.

This position is better for you.]))

The idea is to attack the white group to break up the bottom and left sides.
Since they are the most important areas this favors black.]

In making this move I'm actually more interested in the left side than the bottom since black is already underneath there.]

I think this position is favorable for white.
The white delta stones are a bit overconcentrated but that is offset by the same problem for the marked black stones. Plus there is a little aji in the black position for later.]

(;W[jq]TR[pr]SQ[lr][mr][nr][or][ls][ms][ns][os]C[This is another approach that I have seen. 

The idea is that the marked black stone turns the squared spaces into dame so why not play away from them to influence the left and bottom-left.]

It is on the second line and there is still the cut at A. If I were black I would be very happy for white to play like this.]

Because of the circled white stone the center is not threatening to be a large moyo so I think the focus should be more on territory here.]
