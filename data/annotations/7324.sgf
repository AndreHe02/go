C[Mark: Overall, this replicates some of the issues I have seen recently.  One, my opponent builds up large moyos that (I believe) I can't do anything about.  Two, what I think are good attempts to cut and seperate (and kill) lead to weaknesses that my opponent exploits.

Hi Mark, My name is Gus I'll see if I can help you out.... My comments will begin with Gus:

Summary: Both players had trouble identifying the bigest area to play in. Also both players had a strong tendency to play moves just because they were forcing moves. This resulted in unnecessary liberty reduction, or loss of aji. The Moyo resulted from being overly focused on the local situation and attacking to kill. Attack for profit, killing usually takes a lot of stones and is often ineficcient. If yo will have to kill to profit from the attack then be 100% sure of the kill and even then ask yourself will I be winning after the kill? If not, wait until it is big enough to win. Usually an attack should be profitable even if your opponent lives.]
;B[pd];W[pq];B[dd];W[dp];B[po];W[qo];B[pp]C[Mark: I am not familiar with this joseki.

Gus: This is the small avalanche... I'ts terribly complicated, so don't feel bad. I don't know it very well either :) However, I don't think it's particularly good for black here... Black will be building influence that is already limited by w's lower left corner.]
;W[qp];B[oq]
(;W[qq];B[pn]
(;W[rm]LB[qm:A]C[Mark: Here is where I deviated from joseki.  The correct play is at A.  I don't have to submit here and can be more aggressive.]
;B[ql]C[Mark: Here black takes advantage of my misplay to seal me in.

Gus: painful.]
(;W[jq]LB[np:A]C[Mark: Here I don't use the angle attack at A.  The variation shows what I could do.

Gus: This is better than your variation.]
(;B[np]C[Gus: This seems slow. If black is going to play here at all.. desend, but this area isn't  the biggest on the board. So here's a chance for you..]
;W[cf]LB[mc:D][nc:A][md:C][nd:B]C[Gus:I kinda prefer a plya against the uppr right, but this move is still ok I think]
;B[cn];W[ck]LB[cj:B][cl:A]C[Gus: This seemed like an odd pincer, A tight pincer at A would make senseif you think you can come back and connect the two stones on the upper left, or a loose pincer at B if you don't want to have to come back, but this does neither well...... I think the looser pincer is better here. I like B.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq]
(;W[dn]LB[cj:A][dj:B][go:C]TR[ck]C[Mark: I am unsure about this move.  It settles, but I don't know if the group is in need of settling now.

Gus: note that the marked stone would now be better at A or B. Settling this directly is not so good because you are already over concentrated, and this makes it worse. I would prefer a move at C.]

(;B[fp]
(;W[lq]C[Mark: This stone still has three running directions.  I think it's better to do a big move here, since all groups are safe.  The top looks huge now.

Gus: This stone is a bit difficult to work with right now, but h3 is better than m3 because it's also a threat. This mov makes p2 or o2 more attractive for B]

(;B[lo];W[hq];B[rl];W[qm]

;W[rn];B[pm];W[fc];B[df];W[dg];B[cg]LB[de:A]C[Mark: Again, not familiar with this joseki and can't find a reference in _38 Basic_ or Kogo's.  I believe a better move than my 42 is at A (seperate the stones and try to take the corner).]

(;W[le]LB[nd:A]TR[lc][md]C[Mark: Here I want to cut off the two marked stones.  I don't know if the variation works better.

Gus:The problem began with A... these two stones are not all that easy to kill. Yes they should die, but if black gets move on the outside then capturing them isn't so big.  At this point the moyo is bigger... if you keep that in mind you still have a chance. Notice that black has 2 and a half sides to the moyo already. When you see a big area like the right hand side that can easily get bigger, THAT is the time to take the point between two moyos, or reduce....]
;B[jc]
(;W[je]C[Mark: Here my thinking is to destroy black on the top.

Gus: small];B[lg]C[Mark: But this move does a great job of building the moyo on the right.

Gus: black gets to expand moyo :( Worth more than 3 stones at the top....]

(;W[pl]C[Mark: I cut, hoping to to seperate the groups or make a reduction.

Gus: This is a distraction. Save it for later this is not the important area right now]
;B[qj];W[ol]C[Gus: this is worse than passing. The stone you are forcing is deep inside a moyo that is strong on both sides. You just gave black a free move and a stone, and a potential target for attack if you try to save them.]
