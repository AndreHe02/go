AB[dp][pd]C[Dear Reviewer,

hello and thanks for your review.
I'm requesting your review for White. The game is a DGS one, so every move has been thought a bit.

Please point out my main strategical and tactical errors; even if it was an handicap game, my feelings are that white followed black lines of play. In my review I found some big black errors, so I suppose that he could have crushed me a lot.

[JB\] Hello Dip, I'll mark my comments "[JB\]". I hope my comments are useful... I will try to comment white but I will also mark some black ovious mistakes just in case. 
I don't think White followed black blindly, I think sente changed several times. Maybe the biggest move for black was 66, when he penetrates the white territory... you should not allow your opponent to pass between your stones so easily.
So my points are: (1) do not let your opponent to cut through your stones easily, and (2) at some points you do not evaluate the size of a move correctly (e.g. 32 - L17 was more urgent, and 165 - this one was necessary).
Strategically, I see that you played a territory-oriented game but you waited too long before invading - you did it too late, when you were 30 points behind and it was too difficult to live, though you succeeded. It is important to reach the balance of territory during fuseki, the 2 handicap stones are not too much to prevent you from being more even, specially if the opponent is 5 categories lower.
Thanks for allowing me to analyze the game and forgive my own mistakes. Best regards, Jorge.]

;B[ck];W[ei];B[ek];W[dl];B[dk];W[fq];B[dq];W[jp]C[[JB\] So far white is controlling the flow of the game...]
;B[fo]C[[JB\] I think defense at G4 is important, though I understand that you are trying to develop quickly.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qn]C[[JB\] Is this joseki? White should block at R5; not sure on how to punish, maybe R5, or Q2 and then Q5.]

(;B[rn];W[rm];B[ro];W[qm];B[sm]
(;W[sl]LB[kc:a][gp:b][jk:c]C[[JB\] You could avoid blocking here, if you look at the sequence in var.2, this is worth 7 points more territory, while playing now at e.g. L17 would be more interesting. Blocking at G4 or starting a big moyo near K9 may be worth analyzing too.]
;B[sn];W[rk];B[kc];W[ff]C[[JB\] Maybe too shy, and helps black to grow his territory at the top bigger. But it is difficult to deal with the top after black put L17... Maybe some fight starting with L18, or try to push at J16. White is behind right now, so he must be more agressive.]
;B[he];W[nf]C[[JB\] While this stone may plan a big moyo at the center, still a black invasion at H3 is too big in my opinion.]
;B[ho]C[[JB\] This would have been much better at H3];W[hq]
;B[jn]
(;W[ln]C[[JB\] The hole at L5 is too big, did you analyze L6? Or just M5, then if white keeps the pressure playing M7 you can turn to the center near H9 (see variation).
There may be some fight is black invades C13, but I do not think he will succeed at his rank.]
;B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[os];W[ns]C[[JB\] In this case I think it it ok to defend because I do not see clear big points, though reducing the bottom left territory (e.g. near H8) is important.]
;B[ps];W[mr];B[kl]C[[JB\] Not bad, makes black bigger and reduces white, but I would prefer L5 or something closer to N11. Anyway black is ok because he is about 20 points ahead, but he can loose the advantage if white closes on column N. At this point it is very important to count the territory as often as possible.]
;W[ml];B[gj];W[gi];B[le];W[lf];B[kf];W[lg];B[lk];W[mk];B[lj]
;W[mj]C[[JB\] I think that closing at L5 is more urgent.];B[li]
;W[mi];B[ko]C[[JB\] About time! If this point would have been white, the game would be closer (about 12-16 points for black)]
;W[kp]C[[JB\] Black has the initiative now];B[lo];W[mo];B[lp]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[no];B[lh];W[mh];B[hi];W[kg]C[[JB\] Ok: while this is not as important as L5, it creates some weaknesses in the top and in the center.]
;B[jf];W[jh];B[fi];W[fh];B[gh];W[fg];B[rc];W[re];B[ej];W[di]
;B[bc]C[[JB\] This move does not look so good because it will allow white to take sente.]
;W[bd];B[bb]C[[JB\] Now white has to count and find a way to even the game. I think that black is almost 30 points ahead now! This means invasion or resignation. Maybe test at B8 or C8? Actually, I do not think white can live there.]
;W[jj];B[ik];W[co]C[Desperation invasion. White will be lucky anyway, his group should die in a similar situation.

[JB\] You are right, the game should be over.];B[cp];W[bp];B[bq]
;W[bn];B[bl];W[do];B[eo];W[bm];B[ap]C[[JB\] I think that D6 would have been better. Once the ko is started and since white can play C8 in sente, black is in trouble.]

;W[cm];B[em];W[dn];B[fn];W[fr]C[[JB\] White could play its only card, living in an invasion. Now black is only 10 points ahead, but he has sente.]
;B[lm]C[[JB\] Entering into A12 is bigger.];W[mm]C[[JB\] For the same reason, white should play B10, or better R5 first.]
;B[mn];W[nn];B[ee];W[ef];B[fe];W[if];B[ie];W[me];B[md]C[[JB\] Now white has 4-6 easy points in gote (L15 then K15)]

(;W[qo];B[rq];W[cr];B[cq]C[[JB\] D2 may work... but difficult to analyze.]

(;W[pf]C[white mistake I suppose, originally I preferred to let this one to block the monkey jump at A12 - but I forgot my plan :)

[JB\] As I said you should have blocked the jump before. I do not like black getting Q14, it is worth 20 points at least and white would be lost.
The game is veeeery close here, but black has sente now and as you said, he can make the monkey jump.]
