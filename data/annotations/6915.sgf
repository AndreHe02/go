C[z -- hello cook777, I am Bill, "zinger" on internet Go servers.  My comments are marked with " z -- ".   But remember to check my comments critically.  After all, I am only a weak amatuer - almost certainly, I have made a few mistakes.

z -- I prefer to reference board markings and move numbers in my comments, rather than grid coordinates.  Hopefully, you have a SGF reader which displays these correctly.  I recommed Drago, which I used to make the review.

z -- per your request, I made several comments in the endgame.  However, I think both players need to work on the fundamentals of cutting and connecting.  For example at moves 28-36 both players failed to connect or cut several times.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ic]C[Cook777: I have a lot of trouble with this kinds of openings. I usily play in a way to provent it in most games by playing E16 or E17 before taking the other courner.

z -- I like to play into things that I have trouble with.  It helps me learn.]

(;B[fc]LB[id:a]C[z -- 15 is not good.  Black should play at A instead.]

(;W[jc]LB[id:a]C[z -- I also think 16 at A would be better.  16 as played is biased towards the right, where black is already strong.]
;B[id]C[z -- this is why.];W[je];B[if]LB[ie:a]C[z -- 19 leaves a weakness at A ...]

(;W[kg]C[z -- ... which 20 does not exploit.  See variation.]
;B[qn];W[nq];B[cn];W[dk];B[en];W[fp];B[ci];W[dm]
(;B[cp]LB[dn:a]C[z -- 29 should protect the cut by playing at A.  This is basics, cutting and connecting.]

(;W[do]LB[dn:a]C[z -- 30 should be at A.  White peeped, black ignored; go ahead and cut!]

(;B[co]LB[dn:a]C[z -- 31 must be at A. More basics of cutting and connecting.]
;W[dn]C[z -- this result is much better for white.];B[cl];W[cm]
;B[bk]LB[bm:a]C[z -- 35 must be at A.  Black must stay connected.]
;W[cq]LB[bm:a]C[z -- 36 must be at A.];B[bm];W[md]LB[ie:a]C[z -- if white wants to help this group, pushing and cutting at A is better as previously shown.  Maybe white thought 38 is sente, but it isn't.]

(;W[pl]LB[om:a]C[z -- white should probably play A instead.  This 46 doesn't really get out.]

;B[qp];W[pq];B[rl]C[z -- it looks like white should get captured now.]

(;B[qk]LB[rm:a]C[z -- but 61 doesn't work.  I would play A.]
;W[ql];B[rm];W[qj];B[ro];W[rh];B[ml]C[z -- this capture makes black very strong in the center.]

(;W[qi]C[z -- 68 is a wasted move.  White is already connected.]
;B[jp];W[hq]LB[ei:a]C[z -- 70 is too close to white's thickness to be effective.  Perhaps white should think about playing at A.  Look at the difference between a white stone there and a black one.]

;B[jo];W[gn]LB[ei:a][ie:b][bp:c]C[z -- 82 is very bad.  It attacks nothing, defends nothing, and is gote - basically another wasted move.  I like A, but any of the marked points would be better than 82.]

C[z -- good];B[he];W[ib]LB[hf:a]C[z -- but 92 lets black off the hook.  It should be at A.]
;B[hf]C[z -- very good.];W[hb];B[gc];W[nc];B[le];W[ld];B[jf]
;W[ke];B[kf];W[hk];B[hi]C[z -- black has the lead now and should win.  White needed to reduce the top left area sooner.]
;W[gj];B[gi];W[me]C[z -- black needs to be careful here.]
(;B[lf]LB[mg:a]C[z -- saving one stone isn't important.  Black needs to stay connected .  107 at A is one way that is safer.]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[nf];B[pf];W[ng];B[qg]
(;W[rg]LB[oh:a]C[z -- hmm, could white kill black with 114 at A?]
;B[oh];W[nh];B[oi];W[ni];B[oj]C[z -- I estimate black ahead by about 10 points now.  White could still catch up with a good endgame.  Since you asked about that specifically, I will do my best to comment on it.  However the endgame is very technical and I cannot claim to know the best move.  The best I can hope for is that the moves I suggest are better than the ones played - but not necessarily the best moves on the board.]
;W[jm];B[km];W[jl]C[z -- 122 is small and gote.  See next move for bigger places.]

(;B[hn]LB[bq:a][qb:b][ob:c][kr:d][ir:e][gb:f]C[z -- 123 is also small and gote.  Several bigger moves are marked.  I like A best.]

(;W[hm]LB[bp:a]C[z -- White should ignore 123.  Again, I think A is biggest.]
;B[cc]C[z -- not needed.  This is the same as a pass.];W[bp]
C[z -- good]
(;B[bn]LB[ao:a]C[z -- 127 at A is the correct response.];W[ob]
;B[kl]LB[pb:a]C[z -- small and gote again.  Should be at A.]
;W[ea]LB[pb:a]C[z -- this is not bad, but I still think A is bigger.]
