C[Hagios: Hello, I'll do my best to assist you with your game.  I've done my best to point out main points in this game, and left some general pointers at the end of the review to help you.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[hc]LB[od:A]C[H: This is normally played when W wants to avoid the mini/micro chinese fuseki.  A is also possible.]
;B[gd]LB[id:A]C[H: I don't know exactly what to do here.  This move separates W, but isn't very effective at making huge pressure.  I'd probably play at A.  B is under more pressure than W.]
;W[oc];B[oe]
(;W[kd]C[This was more or less the result I was hoping for, to help the H17 stone. I don't know if it's a "good" result. Also, I wonder if black has a better response once I tenuki from the connection at G16.

H: The shape here is definitely bad.  There's more pressure on the p17 stone than on the h17 stone, so the short extension should be from that one.  Either way, though, this shape is thin and B can take advantage later.]
;B[hd]C[H: B helps W fix his shape...  A "thank you" move.]
;W[ic];B[qk]
(;W[po]C[H: This is too hasty.  B has a weak group to attack, and W has plenty of space to build.  Jumping in here is a bad idea with this shape.]
(;B[qo]LB[jp:A]C[H: B gives W a chance to fix his mistake.  This is the right direction when B has a stone around A.]
(;W[qn];B[qp]C[I know there's a joseki here, but I didn't know it at the time. I remember that jumping out is important. The only variations I know have me jump along the right side.

H: This position won't be joseki.  The psuedo-joseki you refer to deals with when B has a double-wing extension from his corner.]
;W[nn];B[nq]C[H: This result is clearly bad for W.  B gains territory and W has no compensation.]
;W[qi]LB[qi:B][qn:A]C[Feels a little agressive, but I thought the right side was too big, and a move at P9 for black would be huge.

H: This is a bad idea.  You have 1 weak group at A, and you have created a second weak group now at B.]
;B[pj];W[pi];B[oi];W[oj]C[P12 is maybe better? I couldn't read out, but if I can kill, I could connect my two groups. I don't think it actually works though (and it didn't)]

;W[fk]C[H: W is turning the tables now, B has two weak groups.  However, there's one big problem W's missed...]
(;B[fi]
(;W[fg];B[ef];W[eh];B[ej];W[dg]C[I think up until this move I did a respectable, for a 5k, job of keeping pressure on all of black's groups. But inducing black to seal in my corner is I think when this started to fall apart.

H: B gave you chances, but you took them.  Overall, your play has been a bit over-aggressive.  Remember to gather strength before attacking; otherwise you just lose fast.]
;B[df];W[cg];B[cf];W[be];B[bf];W[bg];B[af];W[eb];B[fb];W[bc]
C[I think I'm alive in the corner. More importantly, I think black is dead, but I did worry that my position around K13 is a little thin.

H: I don't think B can kill W's corner.  I'm not sure B should be able to live with his stones at this point.]
;B[ph];W[pg];B[qh];W[rh];B[ri];W[jp]LB[ik:A]C[H: I'm not sure the purpose of this move.  It doesn't make territory, and I don't feel less uncomfortable about your groups.  A still exists, as well.]
;B[ek];W[gm];B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[cj]C[I still assume that black is dead, so I played passively in the lower right and the center.]
;W[eg];B[ie]
(;W[kf]C[H: This way is too thin.];B[ke];W[le]C[I don't know if this is wrong, but it felt like the only move.

;W[jb];B[kc];W[lc];B[kb];W[lb];B[ka];W[ke]C[H: This misses the only chance.  W agreed to a ko with j16.]

H: Indeed, a lot of B mistakes, and you did well taking advantage of them.]
;B[jk];W[jj];B[ik];W[hl];B[hj];W[kl]LB[pn:A]C[KGS' score estimator says I'm up by, and I counted myself down by 2. Regardlss, he resigned here.

H: It's hard to count this game, since there is still a working cut in W's shape at A.  What is unquestionable, though, is that you have made the game close again.


This game showed a lot of fighting spirit, which is good.  Overall, you should focus on two points:

1) Try not to be jealous of your opponent's territory.  Especially don't be jealous of your opponent's moyo.  Jumping into a moyo early is the best way to give your opponent an early lead.  I recommend "How Not to Play Go" by Yuan Zhou (available from Slate & Shell) to help with this idea.

2) Focus more on feeling the strength and weakness of stones.  You failed to find some key points in your and your opponent's shape during this game.  I recommend "Shape Up!" by Charles Matthews (available as a download from Gobase) to help with this idea.]
