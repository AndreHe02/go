C[Hi, I was black in this game and I'm greatly concerned about the fuseki.
I
think Black started to gain a certain advantage along the chuban, then after
losing a big group in the center-left all his advantage has gone. I wonder
what should I have done to save that group.
Comments about the yose would also be appreciated.
Thanks, Ronin.];B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pe];B[qe]LB[qg:a]
[ph:b]C[Maybe a pincer?

Per:
This move is OK, but you could also play a pincer around a or b.]
;W[pd];B[qd];W[oc]C[This situation made me confused. What should I have done?
Hane at q14?

Per:
The most common answer is Q14 removing a liberti from white. See variation.]

(;B[pb];W[pf];B[qf];W[qg]C[Per:
This is an overplay from white.];B[pg]C[Per:
Very good !!];W[ob]C[Per:
This is not sente against black's corner.
See variations.]
(;B[rb];W[ph];B[og];W[nd];B[oh]C[Directly r12?
Per:  Yes r12 is better, but white is still in trouble.];W[pi]
;B[qh];W[qi];B[rg];W[rp]C[What to do here?
Per:
This is probe to see wether you will defend your corner with s3 or go for outside influence with r5.
See variations.
Which move you choose is a matter of playing style.]
(;B[rq];W[qo];B[pp];W[ro]C[Per:
White has to play a ligth move here. Now black has to weak groups to attack. See variation]

(;B[on];W[pm]C[Per:
This helped white too connect his groups];B[pn];W[qm];B[om]
;W[pl]C[Per:
If white wants to defend here Q9 would be better shape];B[fp]
;W[dn];B[fn]C[Per:
Good move.];W[dj]C[Per:
Now black has to protect agains an invasion on the bottom.]

(;B[iq]C[I felt to protect the side, is this right?
If
yes, there was a better place to do that?
Per:
When white plays e3 then j3 will be to close to blacks wall. See previous comment for a different approch.]
;W[id];B[cf]C[I was impressed by
the white formation, and tryed to breach. Is this right?
If yes, this is the right place?
If
not, maybe a move at f10 to reduce white & improve the black moyo, possibly
followed by an invasion in the 3-3 point in the top left corner?

Per:
I believe you have made the right choice. If you play F10 white will play O9 reducing your moyo.]
;W[df];B[dg];W[cg]C[How to handle this situation?

Per: There are many variations from here. I have added a few examples. One common factor is that you strengthen your weakest stone C14.]

(;B[ef]C[Per:
As mention earlier this is the wrong direction.];W[de];B[eg]
;W[ch]C[Per:
Ouch !! This is a huge loss for black who until now had a clear lead.]

Maybe this is a little passive. Did you consider attacking]
;W[jj];B[lj];W[kj];B[ik];W[jk];B[lg];W[hl]C[I think this peep is too much to allow, for black right?
Per:
Yes];B[il];W[hm]C[Per:
Black can ignore this too.]

There some type of magic that can rescue the group at e13 or this is time for sacrifice?

Per:
They can be saved by playing E11. See variation]
