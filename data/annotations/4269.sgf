C[This is my first time requesting a review - so if I do anything wrong, please let me know.  I want to get the most out of this that I can!  --Chris.

Hi Chris, I'm jaime and I'll try to help you. I'll prepend my comments with a "J:". I'll include some general comments in the last movement.
Also, my variations show more "general ideas" than actual correct sequences, so please take them in a general way.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[qe];W[do];B[dj]C[J: Not bad, but I'd rather play K17, to make the most of the shimari (Q17-R15)]
;W[dl]C[J: I'd rather play it low (C8) or even K3];B[cf];W[cd]
;B[fc]C[J: Strong attack, but your left group has weakness and is surrounded by white strong ones. However, given white is open at the top, it's a nice point to press him.]
;W[ec]C[J: Now w is very concentrated :-)];B[fd];W[hc]C[J: Premature; better first press with D14, to make some thickness]

(;B[jd]C[J: Same as prev. comment for w's move, now too many weak groups, see var]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[id];B[jb];W[ic];B[je]
(;W[ie]C[J: W only has one eye, so let's press him.];B[ff]C[J: Very good move. Again, W should have leaned before, see var.]
;W[if];B[fj]C[J: not sure, but I think I'd kept pressing (k14)]
;W[jf];B[le];W[kb];B[lc];W[lb];B[mb];W[ib]
(;B[bk]LB[nb:D][mc:B][kd:C][md:A]C[Probably I should protect here, at a.  White has Wb followed by Wc or Wd.  This turns out to be a source of problems for me later.

J: Sure. I'd protect at B rather than at A, more solidly, but A is ok too.]
;W[bm];B[jp]LB[gq:B][jq:A][mq:C]C[J: I'd rather play it low (A), so you have B it w enters from C zone]
;W[hq];B[kf]C[J: Very good again, L14 is an important move, the only problem is your k4 stone, without a continuation, will bring problems...]
;W[nq]
(;B[jr]C[J: I don't like this move. What's the purpose? If you enclose the right area, you'll have an easy win, so you could use this stone as a sacrifice. In order to save it, running to the center is better, IMHO.]
;W[no];B[pn];W[pq];B[qq];W[pr];B[qk]TR[pk]C[Should this move be high?

J: Too many high moves to my taste, so it's ok IMHO.];W[qh]
C[J: Now W is getting nervous, too much black prospective territory. This is too deep and dangerous.]
;B[nn]C[J: Very good , leaning before attacking, just maybe too far away]
;W[lo]
(;B[ho]C[J: Again, you try to save this stones, if you really want to put them to use, then press W weak group, not the strong one]
;W[gp];B[jn];W[jq]C[J:  Let him connect, and enclose the upper area!!]
;B[iq];W[kq];B[hp];W[gq]

;W[gn];B[gm]LB[hn:A][in:B]C[I don't play at A here, because I think that after Wa and Bb, I will have two eyes.  How wrong I am.  I realize it far too late.

J: Yes, but we really learn from our errors, else we'd all be 9p :-)]

;B[an];W[cl];B[fk];W[im];B[hk]LB[gk:B][il:A]C[My first instinct is to play at A, but I realize that Wb will crush me into a bad shape.  Anyway, I am not too concerned with linking up to the right.

J: Yes, that's a great part of the problem. When in doubt, connect, it's almost always good.]
;W[jl];B[kj]C[J: good, that's the right direction of play];W[kk]

;W[mm];B[nm];W[mo];B[oo];W[op];B[rp]C[J: You leave too many threats for W to exploit. R4 is fine here. and you don't have to worry about R5 later, also w will have less ko threats]

J: Chris, my final comments are:

- don't rush to attack, prepare first (leaning etc)
- look at the whole board, sometimes it's best to give away stones than trying to save everything.
- when possible, defend solidly, avoiding ko threats and forcing moves (opponent's, I mean!)
 I hope this was at least a little bit usefull for you.

W will probably live, but you should be able to make quite a lot of points on the R side while pressing him.
