C[-Hi, my names Amar and I'm dN21death on KGS, maybe around 2-3dan. I haven't played in a long time but hopefully I can still help xD. You didn't leave any questions so I didn't know what to review but if you play on KGS you could talk to me or give me an email back. 

Most of the game was mainly chasing and running with groups. A better whole board view of the game would help a lot and also learning better ways to attack and defend! At 6k though, I think it's good to make mistakes so you can keep learning. 

If you read books, I would really recommend Toshiro Kageyamas Fundamentals of Go. I don't know how much I helped in this game but feel free to contact me if you need more help! 

Also, sorry for being so late, lol. My computer went crazy so it took a while.  

Good Luck in go!

Amar];B[qd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pq]C[- It's usually seen as disadvantageous if your 3-4 stones are facing b's stones like they are now.]
;B[de];W[dg]C[- I might prefer the two space pincer but thats just me. xD]

(;B[qo]C[-B gets a good move though he didn't finish his joseki in bottom left.]
(;W[oo]C[-This move is pretty odd though I see you're trying to build the bottom. Building the bottom is pretty hard when all your stones are on the 3rd line. This made it complicated.]
;B[jo]C[-I don't have a definite move here.. I guess you did have to play G5 but then you kept pushing.]

(;W[gn]C[-Ouch, again, I see you're trying to attack K4 but you're pushing from behind and B gets to make a big influence on like 5th line territory!]
;B[fm];W[gm]C[-As B, I would be glad to keep going but I guess he wanted to play it safe.]
(;B[mo];W[nm];B[lm]
(;W[lp]C[-This was a bad move. It helps B gets stronger and destroys the connection you have with Q3.]
;B[mp];W[lo]C[Now you're building territory next to your wall, bad.]
;B[mn]
(;W[kn]C[-You do not want to make territory where your wall is, this turned out pretty bad.]
;B[pl];W[km]C[-You're pushing from behind again and making your split group even weaker. It's not even connected solidly.]
(;B[ll];W[pn]C[-This isn't a good move to make but you have to do it to make sure you're connected.]
;B[qn];W[nk];B[kl];W[od];B[pf];W[fl]C[-This is pretty bad. You are just asking B to make territory there.]

(;W[he]C[-If we look at the whole board now your only source of points is at the bottom. Top left might have a few points as well. 

B has bottom left and a good chance of creating a lot of points on the right side.

You have no eyeshape with the Q3 group and the corner is still open. P16 needs to create shape or could be attacked now. B has a running group at F12. You really dont have any area to create potential territory except that corner at top right..]
