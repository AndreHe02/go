Nisse [7k\]: good game

Dear reviewer. Thanks for having a look at my game.

I think I was the underdog after the opening and could never catch up.]

;W[fq]
(;B[gp];W[cj]C[So white gets here first.]
(;B[cf];W[jc]LB[gc:B][mc:A]C[Since white at C13 isn't under much threat white goes to destroy black's moyo. A and B are miai.]
;B[lc];W[fc]
(;B[ec]C[I think this just helps white make perfect shape.  Since white didn't go for 2 stone extension it might be worth looking for a way to attack white.]
;W[fd];B[kd]LB[hc:A][le:B][lf:C][lh:D]C[This is called a sholder hit - a type of contact move.  Contact moves always strengthen your opponent.  Here's where I remind my students that a move can do 4 things:

grow your territory
reduce your opponent's territory
strengthen your group
weaken your opponent's group

Do all four it's a fantastic move.  Do 3 it's a good move. Do 2 it might be an ok move.  Do 1 it's too slow.  Do none - we need to talk!

I think this move strengthens white, allows w territory to grow but does very little for black's group or territory.  (White didn't respond so an invasion at A begins to look possible.)

If you want to do anything in this area I'd look at B instead or may be even C or D to grow the moyo,]
;W[dm]
(;B[fo]LB[ko:A]C[What are you thinking here?  (See 4 requirements I mentioned earlier.)  I'd go for A to grow the group and improve on its shape.]

C[[All through the game i treid to gain as much as possible from my moyo in NW corner, while using my lower group to make his areas at the lower half smaller.

It was not enough and even though i couldn't count it I felt already at this point that it was to little.

What should I have done at this stage?\]


A and B look possible at this point instead of M5.

Later your middle game needs more work.  It might be that you aren't looking at the whole board and seeing weaknesses such as A and B.  

I've only added a few remarks after this point since your question was more to do with the opening.]

(;B[cj]C[With 2 white stones facing aup the left side the first to get to this point has an advantage.  The 2 stones on line 3 are stable but not secure so another mover there isn't necessary yet.  You can always run out to the middle toward black's now extensive moyo at the top.]

(;B[ep]C[This is a more common development for a 3/4 corner of white's and easier to gaine a footing.  Playing in the middle just seems to help white strengthen the BL corner.

There are plenty of joseki's to study for follow up.]))
