;B[pd]C[ T : Hello, I'm Tilwen, 1k KGS, and I will make a review of your game. My comments will start with a "T:".]

(;W[eq]TR[dc][fd]C[hedin [7k\]: Is this shimari big enogth? or i had to
 E13?

T : It's hard to say that the shimari is bad, but you miss a chance to go on the attack in the upper left corner. If you defend with C18 or K17 for instance, the two marked stones get strong and you can aim at attacking black. With your shimari, the marked stones are weak and Black can attack them. E13 doesn't seem really interesting now, because black can play C18 and he will live easily, while C13/E13 will lack a safe base.]
;B[ci];W[eg]
(;B[bf];W[bg]C[hedin [7k\]: Is keeping black split big enogth now?

T : Yes, if Black connects, white will have two weak groups and black only one, rather strong. In fact, the B14 move is bad for black, he could have connected (see variation).]
;B[cb];W[dk];B[ei]
(;W[di]C[T : This is VERY bad (usually, and here for instance), never try to cut a tobi, unless you're very strong outside (see variation)]
;B[dh];W[dj];B[ch]C[T : Now white needs to connect at D13, Black connects at E12, and the whole sequence made Black stronger for almost nothing to white.]
;W[dg];B[eh]C[hedin [7k\]: This cut have not worked as i think, is this finaly better for black or for white?

T : For Black (see variation)]
(;W[fg];B[bk]C[hedin [7k\]: black 25 is so big ... can i afford c10 or b9 myself instead of f13 ? will i have a chance to survive or good enougth adzi in b-f13 group after black f13?

T : losing your E13 group would be very big, I think you need to get out like this. The mistake was earlier.]

(;W[ef]C[hedin [7k\]: was it better to just block from outside?

T : This seem greedy, and your groups are cut now. If you can't kill upper left corner, it's better to play safe here.]
;B[gf];W[gg];B[hf];W[cd];B[de];W[bd];B[cc]C[T : The F17 cut is very big.]

T : as earlier, don't cut a tobi like this, unless you're very solid outside.]

T : Hard to say, there are lots of sequences around san-san invasion, I don't know them all. Black is quite strong outside, but there is empty space around R14, it could be hard to kill white.]
