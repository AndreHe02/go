C[B: hi, I'm Bart, around 7 kyu, and will try to review your game. My comments start with B.]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[dp];W[pq];B[jj]LB[nc:B][qo:A]C[B: not unusual, but usually only played as a helping stone for corner fights later on. Around A or B is usual.]
;W[dj]C[B: I'd prefer this stone one line lower. Playing on the 4th line lets you run away to the center more easily. Because of the stone at tengen (K10) this is harder.]
;B[jd];W[md]C[B: this is still a bit loose. It doens't defend your corner and doesn't attack the black stone. See variations.]

(;B[jp];W[oj]C[B: same comment as on D10 and N16. Black can easily make a living group below that stone, if necessary.]

(;B[kd]C[We are both still studying opening plays, but this stone here at L16 seemed beneficial to black during battles later in the game.

B: in opening, it is about influence and territory. For instance, a stone at 3-3 (e.g. R17) gives corner territory, but no influence. A stone at 4-4 (e.g. Q16) gives influence, but no terriory (the other player can still get the corner). A stone at 3-4 (e.g. Q3) does half the job. White needs R5 to secure the corner.

B: right now, all stones are high (on the 4th line), so all corners are still open, and the side areas can be invaded as well. White had more influence on the right side, and black on the left.]

(;W[dm]C[B: another high stone.];B[cn]C[B: good approach.];W[bm]
C[B: C7 a little better.];B[bn];W[am]
(;B[dg]C[B: Black can also push at C7.];W[ch];B[cg];W[bg];B[bf]
;W[ag];B[af];W[bi];B[ei]LB[gc:A]C[B: after making the wall (marked stones), black can also defend the corner (around A). White will not make much points going out with the white group in the left.]

(;W[cl]C[B: if you play there, then better at C7. Now it is like you respond to a black stone that is not there yet. And after the black stone is there, you still need to play another move at C8.]

(;B[ej]
(;W[di];B[dh];W[ek];B[fk];W[el];B[fl];W[fm];B[gm];W[fj]LB[fc:A]
[qf:C][qo:B]C[The group created by this cut was ultimately captured, but I am not sure if it was a poor play to begin with, or if I made some mistake along the way.

B: it's more about timing. You play 3 moves to make about 4 points. Let's go back a few moves. What happens if you play move 28 elsewhere? Can black kill your group? If not, how many points can you make by playing somewhere else? E.g. R5 secures a corner and makes about 10 points. Which is a lot more that you make with the 3 moves after move 28.

B: and by cutting, you create a weak group surrounded by black stones, which is hard to fight and live. Playing something like A is an easier invasion point. Or B, C to make your own territory.]
;B[fi];W[gj];B[gl];W[gi];B[gh];W[hi]
(;B[ih]C[Black believes he should probably have played J12 first (instead of G12) to prevent what white does next. We are looking for better insight on how Black should have stopped white's invasion.

B: this is indeed not the correct way to stop white. But what if black ignores white?]
;W[hh];B[hg];W[fh];B[eh];W[gg];B[fg];W[ig]TR[fg][fi]C[I am not sure if it would have been better to save the stone at F12 by filling the eye at G12, but J13 felt right.

B: the stone at F12 is not that important. There is no eye there. The marked stones make it a false eye.]

(;B[hf]
(;W[ff];B[gh];W[gf];B[ef];W[fh];B[fe];W[eg];B[de]
(;W[fg]C[B: this makes your group into one big ball. Better to try and get out.]
;B[ge];W[gh];B[jg];W[if];B[he];W[jf];B[ii];W[cf];B[df];W[be]
C[This play was simply poor observance on white's part. After review, I realized I'd meant to play C15 instead. I still don't know if this would have made the group to the right worth saving a few turns prior.]
;B[ce];W[kg]
(;B[hj]C[B: no need, white is captured already. Better to defend the stone at K11.]
;W[jh];B[gk]C[Black explained that though this group was dead, so it would have been better to play elsewhere, he didn't want it to become alive again later in the game, and this play felt safer than a faster play elsewhere.

B: I see no way of it becoming alive again.];W[an];B[bp];W[ap]
;B[aq];W[ao];B[bq];W[bo];B[co];W[eo];B[ep]
(;W[fp]C[This play was difficult for me to decide. I'd hoped to keep the two black groups separated, while continuing my attack, but it got harder a turn later.

B: I think the black group in the corner is already alive, so no need to keep them separated. Better to concentrate on the right side.]
;B[fo]
(;W[go]C[We discussed this after the game. I had considered playing F6 instead of G5, to force black out. But I decided it would be better to have influence near the bottom.

B: correct, but doesn't work because of the atari at F6 next move.]
;B[fn];W[en];B[em]
(;W[hp]C[I wish I had had the foresight to see this error before I made it. This play ended up deciding the entire game. We both agreed that G4 here would have been a far better play, and would have allowed white strong influence near the bottom of the board, with a lot of flexibility. We firmly believe this is what lost white the game.

B: G4 would have been stronger, but still it would be a very weak group.]
;B[fm];W[dn];B[fq];W[gp];B[gq]
(;W[jq]C[Here I was unsure how to bypass black's stone at K3.  Should I have played K5 instead?

B: that would still leave you with too little room to make 2 eyes. I think.]
;B[hq];W[ip];B[iq]
(;W[kp];B[jo]
(;W[io]C[Here I did a very stupid thing. I had lost some mental stamina, and had the foolish notion that if I could gain enough liberties, I could win in a capturing race against black's group in the third row. It was a lost cause from the start, but I was tired and did not think clearly. I apologize for the next five plays.

B: ok, no problem.];B[jn];W[in];B[jm];W[im];B[jl];W[il];B[ik]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[kq];B[hr];W[kr];B[is];W[ln]LB[qg:C][qj:B][qo:A]
C[B: good idea. I'd prefer somewhere around A, B or C. Otherwise black can still invade and live there.]

(;B[js]C[B: too small. Better to invade now. See variations for some ideas.]
;W[lj]C[B: it keeps black out, but black can still invade from the inside.]
;B[mc]C[B: this sort of says: "I'm okay with white having the whole right side and let's do endgame." Which is ok if you counted and are well ahead. I'm not so sure, so I'd invade and at least get a corner of part of the side part of that big white area.]

;W[ne];B[lf];W[mg];B[ll]
(;W[ml]C[This next set is an area I am weak at: Defending gaps. By the ludicrous mistake back at  Move 104, I put myself a stone or two behind, and was left with this gap to defend. I ultimately succeeded in maintaining my territory but I am unsure if I did well or what could have been done better.

B: I'd play a little further away. A little less territory, but also less cutting points.]
;B[lm];W[mm];B[mn]C[This was a tough cut I'd hoped black wouldn't play.

B: yes, this was invited by attaching your stone to the black one earlier on.]
;W[nn]
(;B[lo]C[B: one rule that usually works: stretch the stone that is in atari. It is too easy to let white captiure the stone. See variation.]
;W[mo];B[kn];W[mn];B[lp]
(;W[lq]C[B: I'm pretty sure L5 is possible.];B[ko]C[B: don't forget to come back at N3.]

(;W[ke]C[This led nowhere, and I wish I had simply played L14, or better, N4

B: Yes, N4 also works, N3 is a little easier.];B[ld];W[nd];B[ks]

;W[nq];B[np];W[op];B[no];W[oo];B[nr];W[ns]C[Black believes white should have saved the stone at O3 by playing P3. I explained that I would prefer to have a ko threat in place, than risk black invading further.]

(;B[mj]LB[qj:A]TR[qg][qm]C[Black has explained that he does not expect to succeed with this play because he lacks the knowledge and experience to properly invade. There is a lot of open space behind white's wall that an experienced player might use, but black simply doesn't know how.

B: I hope to have shown some ideas earlier on. What you want is to get a base fast. A base is usually 2 stones with 2 spaces in between. If black starts around A, he can jump to one of the marked places, whatever white does.]
;W[li];B[cm];W[dl]C[I realized after placing the stone that B9 would have been a better play. Black punished greedily.

B: yes, a common mistake, even good players can make after a long and tiring game.]

I believe that the mistake at J5 (move 104) was a large mistake, but the move that decided the game, was H4 (move 92)
