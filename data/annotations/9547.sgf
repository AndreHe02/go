C[EatenAlive3: Hi, enjoy the game.
mira: hi

I am EatenAlive3 playing Black.
I have some questions, and comments about why I chose certain moves. I imagine I'm wrong about a lot of things, so please tell me if I'm wrong about certain comments.
Thank you for reviewing!!

J: Hi, my name is Jay, I will be reviewing your game.  My comments start with "J:".]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dc];W[dp];B[cn];W[dn];B[dm];W[co]C[I don't see this often, but I figured that a joseki would start with forcing move E6. I wanted the left side.]
;B[en];W[do]
(;B[cm]C[J: black can also consider E7.  See varation.]
(;W[cj]C[I didn't expect this, so I decided that I should play C12 so that I could start developing in the upper left

J: C10 is an overplay.  Joseki, is to cut at E7, see variation.

J: E10 for black is another idea.  See variation.]
(;B[ch];W[ce]
(;B[cd]C[since C15 was already pincered, I figured that I should attach

J: C16 strengthen white here.  When attacking, attack froim afar.  Black can consider E16.]
;W[de];B[eh]C[... but I forgot to reinforce the corner.

J: Yes reinforcing with E16 is a good idea, but E12 is ok too.]
;W[ej];B[dk];W[dj];B[gh]C[J: Black should fix E16 now.];W[ec]
C[J: E17 is painful for black.];B[ed]C[J: Complicated fight, E16 is a good idea when black has stones near to help, otherwise simply E18 is safe.]
;W[dd];B[cc];W[eb];B[ee];W[bd];B[bc];W[be];B[db];W[ba]
(;B[gc]TR[da]C[J: Can try descending at D19 instead.  See variations.]
;W[da];B[fb];W[ac];B[fc];W[ea];B[fa];W[ca];B[ab];W[ad];B[bb]
;W[ef]
(;B[ff]C[J: considering black has so many stones around, black should cut at D14.  See variation.]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[fe];B[fd];W[fg];B[gf];W[eg];B[fh];W[gg];B[hg]
;W[cg]TR[hf][hh]C[J: Black has a lot of cutting points now.]

(;B[bg]C[J: White cannot be killed here. black should solidify H12 to attack E10.  See variaiton.]
;W[bf];B[cf];W[df]
(;B[bh]C[J: should be at B11 threatening to connect with C7.  See varation for followup.]
;W[af]C[Was a better result for Black in the corner possible after the mistake of not reinforcing? Or was it possible for white to have killed the corner?]
;B[gj];W[fk]
(;B[fl]C[J: F8 is a poor way to attack.  Touching a stone makes it stronger.  In this case, black is making white stronger.

J: black should instead consider G7 to move out faster.  See variation.]
;W[gk]TR[gj][fk][fl]C[J: This "cut knight" is very painful shape -- even worse than the "empty triangle."]
;B[hj];W[gl]
(;B[fm]TR[fo]C[J: White can't actually cut E7 immediately because D9 catches the cutting stone in a net, so black can run faster.  G6 or F5 is better here.  See variations.]
;W[gp];B[ek];W[fj];B[hn];W[il];B[ik]C[J: once again, black should not touch white's stones.]
;W[gm]C[this move caught me by surprise.];B[gn];W[im];B[jo]
C[J: K5 is an active way to play.];W[fo];B[fn];W[in];B[io]
(;W[hp]C[I expected G5 or L7. H4 doesn't seem like it does anything.

J: H4 is a bit slow, though it does prevent black from playing there.  As it stands, even if white cuts, black can still live, but the result is favorable for black.]
;B[km]TR[jl][kn][ho]C[J: black has too many cutting points again.  I would imply connect at H5.  If your stones are strong, your opponents becom weak.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[kn];B[lm];W[jn];B[ko]C[J: Black cannot fight when there are so many weaknesses in its shape.]
;W[jk];B[jm];W[ln];B[mm];W[ho];B[lo];W[mn];B[op]TR[km][hn][jo]
C[J: black has 3 weak groups now.  White has lots of targets to attack, not to mention C7 is not looking healthy.]
;W[ck];B[cl];W[el]
(;B[dl]C[J: black is dead if he connects D8.  Should be B5 first, black cannot save E6.  See variation.]
;W[bo];B[bk];W[bj];B[al];W[aj];B[bn]C[I read out that white can turn this into a ko at B8, so it's not very good for black... but I didn't have time to fix it later on.

J: black is dead here. White will A6 first.  See variation.

J: The game is basically lost for black.]
(;W[nm]C[J: white should kill black at A6 now.];B[lk]C[this move came back to hurt me, which would have been a good alternative?

J: White gave black a chance to live, so A6 to live, and sente endgame.  Assuming niehter player saw A6, M9 is okay.]
;W[np]
(;B[no]C[J: black should sacrifice the four stones, and play O3 instead.  See variation.]
;W[mo]C[How could I have made the 4 stones at K5 live?

J: it doesn't look possible.];B[mp];W[nq]C[J: black is cut to pieces, it's impossible to fight here.]
;B[mq];W[nr]C[L3 instead of N2?]
(;B[mr]C[J: yes, L3 is better shape, but white will not even bother killing, and play solidly to secure victory.  See variations.]

;W[is];B[js]C[next few moves are me getting more thinking time, the clock was at 20 second byo yomi. Also I wasn't sure what to do next. Eventually I tenukid to defend the right side]

;W[eo];B[go];W[hq];B[lp];W[fq];B[nn]C[this was a very bad move...]
;W[om];B[pm];W[pl];B[pn];W[ql];B[qo];W[rp];B[qh]C[J: at this point, the entire top of the board is not worth as much as the amount white can kill on the bottom side.]
;W[nc]TR[nj]C[J: white shouldn't play a risky move like this, and just reduce from the O10 direction.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[ld]C[J: normally, black should play Q14, but in this dire situation, M16 might be okay.]
;W[pe]C[the same thing happened. I figured that the R12 stone could help me defend, but I didn't expect white's response to R15

J: this attachment is a common punishment for omitting Q14.]

(;B[qe]C[J: in this specific situation, black should just fall back to R16 for strength.  See variation.]

;W[nb];B[mf];W[nf];B[ng]C[EatenAlive3: Thanks for the game]
;W[lc]C[Thank you for reviewing!\
J: I think the main take away from this game is that black needs to keep his group stronger.  When your groups are strong, your opponent's group becomes weaker.  Trying to attack with a weak group only makes cutting points.

J: Also remember that touching a stone makes it stronger.  Thanks for showing me this game.]
