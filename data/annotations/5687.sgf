RE[B+12.5]

C[Hi, my name is Justin.  I've tried to review your game, but am afraid that my commentary has ended up being a bit shallow in places.  In any case, I hope it will prove somewhat helpful.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[oc]
(;W[qj]MA[qk]C[White 6 looked odd to me.  I sometimes play this fuseki as Black and am usually approached in the lower right.  A search confirmed that 6 is never seen in pro-play.  Curiously the space below is played, though it is still rare.

Beyond what the professionals do, it is a natural way to play to approach the open corner before the side.]
;B[qn];W[qg]C[Black's position seems easy to me.];B[jd];W[eq]
;B[jq]
(;W[cj]C[This midpoint has a good relation to the upper and lower left corners.  The star point is also worth considering.]
;B[fc];W[df];B[db]TR[jd]C[This slide is generally considered bad when the triangled stone is so far away.  We'll see why later.]
;W[cc]C[Although this is locally joseki, Black takes sente and gets a very big point on the bottom side, so it's worth looking at alternatives.]
;B[jo];W[oo]C[I've tried to think of alternate invasions for White, but everything feels a bit off.]
;B[po];W[oq]C[This move mostly seems to make white heavier (forces white to commit to saving these stones and/or makes them harder to defend), without giving white much of a shot to make eyes on the bottom.]

(;B[pl]C[I think this move is slack, even though it slightly weakens the two space extension above.  The variation shows a possibility for Black to punish white's previous move.]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[op];B[qq];W[kp];B[jp];W[kq];B[ko]TR[kp][kq]C[The triangled stones are bad shape for White.]
;W[mp]C[Evaluating the invasion: white has denied black territory where he previously had an extension.  The cost, however, is that the corner is solid territory, and white's group may well be subject to attack.  If Black's stones to the left were weak, this might be compensation, but they are rather thick.]

(;B[fq];W[er]
(;B[fr];W[fp]C[Good. This gives Black bad shape.];B[hq]C[The two black stones are doing very little good.]

(;W[mc]C[I have two comments concerning this invasion.  The first is that I think there are better ways to invade.  The second is that I actually wonder whether the balance of territory necessitates an invasion.]
;B[lc];W[me];B[ld];W[md];B[oe];W[le];B[ng]
(;W[nf];B[of]C[This peep is harmful, since it hurts one of your two groups.]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[nb];B[la];W[mb]C[It's urgent to escape, and this sequence is gote, so it hurts White.]
;B[jf];W[ke];B[je]
(;W[pb]C[This invading group has become very big, and it's in a lot of danger-black can surround it if you don't escape.  So, before playing any moves, you need to make sure that they either are 

1) genuinely sente sequences, so that you can come back and defend, 
2) moves that escape, 
or 
3) moves that get you two eyes.  

If you're unsure, you should probably opt to escape.];B[ob]

(;W[ed];B[gd]TR[jf][je][jd][kd][ld][lc]C[Now that the upper right has been mostly given up on, Black has a good lead.  So you should be willing to take some risks.  Don't try and trick your opponent, but don't hesitate to make the game as complicated as possible-this gives you some chances to find a tesuji that will get you back in the game.  

These 5 stones are worth a few points, but they also could threaten the triangled cutting group.]

(;W[ge];B[hd]C[From here on out, Black plays quite conservatively, but has enough of a lead to still do so.   Capturing the group in the upper right was the deciding factor in the game.]
