C[Dear, tomikm.

I hope my review will be very informative for you.

(;B[jp];W[jd];B[jj]C[I like that black big moyo. Especially I like that tengen move played by myself some times.

Thats gonna be an interesting game.];W[nc];B[fq]C[Quiet good for black. But there is still komi. So its a close game.]
;W[eq]LB[cq:a]C[White is strenghtening Black. And Black will have A later.]
;B[fp];W[er]LB[fc:a][cf:b][ne:c][qf:d][qp:e][qj:f][qq:g][cn:h]
C[White gets greedy and makes a small move (compared to what black have). So you just need to make a BIG MOVE, like A, B, C, D, E or G, or even H. You can make variations by yourself.]
(;B[fr]C[This move is a bit slow, because its only defensive.]
;W[cm]SQ[gp][hp][ip][jq][jr][js][fs][es][co][cn][cl][ck][bk]
[ak]C[Well, lets count territory.

Black got 9 points of sure territory.
White got about 20 points.

So, locally black got less points. Therefore F2 was not goot enough.]
;B[ne];W[qc]C[White is coming back. He got 2 sure corners, black has none. So the game will be decided by the black's ability to use tengen move efficiently.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[oc]C[For me, I still think black is ahead, because tengen is making good moyo with all the black stones around.

I would have played C17 to live in the corner.];B[cc]C[I like that.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ch]C[Oops, white is really mistaken.];B[ed]C[The best move Black can play here.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[ee]SQ[es][co][cn][cl][ck][ci][bh][ah][lc]
[mc][kc][kb][ka][rc][sc][rd][sd][nf][ng][nh][oi][qj][rj][sj]
[jq][jr][js][ip][hp][gp][bb][ba][eb][ea]C[Black should be happy by now. Lets count.
 White got about 48 points of sure territory total. Black got about 37 points of sure territory.

So, for black its good enough just to defend at R3, and there will be no chance for white to win.]

;B[ea];W[be];B[gc];W[hb];B[gd];W[pq]C[Wise move for white. But I think there still no chance to win.]

(;W[os];B[nq];W[rq];B[rp];W[rs];B[ns];W[qr]LB[le:a][ke:b][kf:c]
C[Well, that is more than 60 points diffirerence.
A, B or C are all good.];B[ld]C[Overplay.]
(;W[md]C[And again white is making no effort to exploit weaknesses.]
;B[me]LB[le:a]C[White can play A. He must to.];W[lc];B[kd];W[kc]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[kg];W[jg];B[kh];W[qj]LB[qi:a][qk:b]C[I never know what to do about this. Wouldn't white Q7 or R7 be better?

Because you are strong on both sides, it doesn't matter you play either A or B.]

White got 85 points.

White has the lead (komi)....

Black needs to make more than 10 points to win. Like to play A.]
