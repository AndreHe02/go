;B[pd]C[Hi Christiann,

my name is Joerg, I am about 4k and hope my comments help.]
;W[pq];B[dd];W[cp];B[qo];W[mp];B[ep];W[dm];B[jp]C[W does not play joeski. K4 should be K3.]
;W[qm];B[pp]C[mistake, Q4 shoould be at R3. B:W is 1:3, so B should try to make life in the corner.]
;W[qq]C[exchange is bad for B];B[oq]C[overplay, B should not get through with this]

(;W[nq]C[W's mistake, see alternate route]
(;B[oo]C[?, now W can play P3 in sente];W[or]
(;B[mo]C[B must cover at P4]
(;W[lp]C[... and W must take at P4...];B[lo]C[excahnge is good for W. W is on the 4th line and ahead]

(;W[qp]C[they are many better moves for W....];B[ro]C[exchange is good for B]
;W[rp]C[very bad move from W (also open triangle)];B[qk]C[yes, B should consider playing R10  instead]

(;W[om]C[W jumps out too slowly...];B[ok];W[op];B[po]
(;W[pl]C[W misses his chance];B[pk]C[exchange is good for B]
;W[nn];B[no]C[perfect for B];W[nl]
(;B[ol]C[B should keep the preasure on W];W[nk]
(;B[ql]C[useless];W[pm];B[rm]C[B connects, that is fine. However both B's shapes are strong enough.]
;W[nj]C[W should extend towards left, this only help B to close the gap on the right side]

(;B[ph]C[exaclty, P11 is alos possible];W[jd]C[this gives B huge chances. B should attack the group O10 and drive it towards the upper side, and the run a split attack against W]

(;B[md]C[B can play aggressive here at M17. Maybe other side os better (H17)]
;W[gd]C[W sould play F17];B[cf]C[too defensive];W[ch];B[dj]
C[too high, C10 would be ok.];W[eh];B[fj];W[ck];B[cj]C[exchange is good for B]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[el];B[fl];W[fm];B[gl]C[leaning attack, very good]
;W[gm]
(;B[hm]C[it is also a leaning attack from W against E4. So cover the lower left side is urgent now for B]
;W[hn];B[im];W[in];B[jn]C[B has lots of weak spots now in his wall]
;W[hp]C[With this move white cut black off from E4 and later I tried too hard to save E4.

Yes, in fact W should have played G4. B can still make trouble at C3.]

(;B[ff];W[fe]
(;B[ee]C[E14 is correct];W[gf];B[fg];W[ei];B[ej]
(;W[fh]C[G11, F12 is terrible];B[gh];W[gg];B[dg];W[ed]
(;B[df]C[D15, better shape];W[dc];B[ec]C[right];W[fd];B[cc]
;W[db];B[cb];W[eb];B[nh]C[what about covering C16?]
(;W[mi];B[mh]C[exchange very good for B];W[li];B[lk]C[shape destroyer]
;W[lh];B[lf]C[not important to play here, it would be wiser to cover the cutting point at H8 and K7]
;W[jg];B[kg]C[should not work like this];W[lg]C[yes, W punishes B's last move]
;B[kf]
(;W[kh]C[W should continue to annoy B. L12 is bad shape];B[jf]
;W[ig]
(;B[he]C[This was perhaps too aggressive?

- yes, because the stone can be cut off easily (as W actually does). H12 would be a nice move here for B]
;W[if];B[ie]C[this is then a additionally lost move];W[je];B[jc]
C[? how should this work out?]
(;W[id];B[ic];W[hc];B[hb];W[gc]C[now W is punished. This move hurts.]
;B[kd];W[hd];B[gb];W[fb];B[mg]
(;W[ji]C[W misses G11];B[gi]C[yes, right. more than urgent]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[kk];B[kl];W[mm]C[W is already alive. This move is wasted.]
;B[lm]C[too small. Lower left corner has more potential];W[lj]
;B[oj];W[ni];B[oi];W[ik];B[hk];W[il];B[hl];W[ca];B[cd];W[bb]
;B[bc];W[da];B[ab];W[ba];B[bk];W[bl];B[cl]C[I did not calculate properly here.]
;W[dl];B[bm];W[al];B[ak];W[cm];B[bi];W[hj];B[hq]C[What would have been a better way to connect, or threaten to connect E4?

- I think there is still a risk, as K4 can be cut off, I prefer to check possibilities at C3. Depending on W's reaction H3 might be a good move.]
;W[gq];B[ip];W[go];B[fq]C[B treis to fight on both sides, that cannot work. With J4 B gave up E4.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[kp];B[ko];W[jq];B[gs]C[will this work? what if W cauts at J3?]

(;W[fr]C[W is really too cautious];B[er]C[B seems undecided]

;B[jo];W[ga];B[ia];W[qc]C[Up until this invasion, I think I was leading comfortably. I tried to deal with it as aggressively as possible, but my opponent did very well here and perhaps this is where I lost the game?

- yes, the 3x3 point needs coverage earlier. The loss of the corner is big. B should have first try to make life in the lower left corner and then make a move at R16 before W invades]

C[move should be played as ko-threat];W[rc];B[qn];W[so];B[sn]
;W[sp];B[ij];W[jj];B[ha]C[move like this should be avoided. In fact, if B want sto play here, he should first play F1, so that W is forced to play another stone at F17.]
;W[fa];B[mn]C[what about the group at J19?];W[bo]C[W gives away one point.]
;B[on];W[nm];B[hj];W[aa];B[ac];W[ja]C[Ummm actually this was sloppy on my part, I had sente until a few moves ago and should have made the top secure first. Somehow I just did not "see" it.
