Parlement:
This is my first game uploaded to Go Teaching Ladder; I wanted to get an idea of how my standard play is.  I won this game by a bit too much, not through my own skill, but I want to see where I did correctly exploit situations, the errors I made, and if I can even see things that'll help me get better.

I've listed my thoughts on the situations that arose in the game.  I'm interested as much in comments on those as I am in comments on the moves.  Does my analysis of the situation make sense?  Am I way off base?  I appreciate any advice you can provide.  Thanks,

I intended to trade the corner for easy life on the side.  Probably not the best idea.

It's ok, it depends on your style of play but trading the corner is best to do it early in the game]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cg]C[Parlement:
His pincer-extension here seemed like a bad idea, so I seized on the opportunity.]

Black b3 seems to avoid the issues that crop up.];W[bo];B[bq]
;W[co]C[Parlement:
I was happy with this result, as I felt it to be ample side territory, big influence, and it plays well with my bottom right.

this is much better for W];B[ar]C[Parlement:
I thought he should have D2 instead since he had to worry about living, much less passive.  Probably the result of the battle disheartened him.  That probably influences the rest of the game, but I'm interested in how well I'm seizing opportunities...  I'll put my thoughts about "big moves" as I saw them in the game.]
;W[jc]C[Parlement:
My work was done and black playing k17 or k16 would be unacceptable.]
;B[mc];W[gc];B[ec];W[cc]C[Parlement:
I regret invading in this fashion.  I feel I should have pushed out, but this, too, seems like it worked out in my favor.

yes this invasion is too aggressive and is not good for W, but it forces B to careful play]

;B[bf];W[dc];B[ed];W[df]C[Parlement:
Might as well keep them split.  Maybe something like f14 or g14 instead, though, so he'd have to kill c15 and I can build a moyo?

the corner is dead for W, even wasting a move, so you arent really spliting. W and B misread this tsumego.]

I wanted to run faster, but a one space jump always read like certain, instead of merely very likely, death.]

Because this feels uncomfortable...  Was there a better or more reasonable way to do this?  The aim was to maximize territory on the bottom side and still point openly towards the g11 group.]

not really, but if it eases your peace of mind dont hesitate in wasting a move to ensure your territory]

you mean c18, defintely. Huge blunder for B, and its not the first one. You did good exploiting his mistakes]

Parlement:
I think I won as much as I did because he was psyched out by the first battle.  I didn't earn the bottom left or top left corners.  I did get sloppy and lost that group on the right side.  From what I saw in review, there were several times I simply overextended or got too ambitious in my projects.  As far as my thoughts went, was there anything major that I missed, or that shows about my thought processes I should work on?

My evaluation of this game is that you are an aggressive player, which puts the opponent in preassure but has the downside of playing risky moves. B made too many mistakes, your only blunder was in move 166, which could have been decisive if B wouldnt have given up the upper-left and down-left corner by blunders. You did well in exploiting your opponent's mistakes.

My advice is that you play a little bit lighter, since you are an aggresive player, playing lightly could sometimes mean more sacrifices and more attacks, but this kind of play is within your style and often gives you sente. I'm also a very aggressive player myself, that's why I give you this advise. Also when you ask for a review, choose a game that you lose, specially when you think you played well and still lost the game ( I know it's hard to look back to these games), but are in those games where your weaknesses show and this is the point of reviewing games.

I also think you are stronger than 8k, I'm 4k but haven't played in months, so if you want to play a game let me know, my nick is "Sickboy" in kgs.
