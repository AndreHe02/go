AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi reviewer and thank for your time.

This is a 3 stone game on KGS where I tried to keep solid and maximise the handicap stones but in the end never managed to get through and probably had my real losing moment when I could not kill the group on the left. In general I always have the feeling of arriving in an urgent area not in time and maybe after my opponent, as per d10 for example. So I would like to develop this feeling of when to leave the fight and go for another big point.

Reviewer:
Hello, i'm Gianluca 7k i will do the review fot you. I hope you enjoy it.]
;W[dd];B[fd];W[qn];B[nq]C[Wrong joseki probably here, the idea was to stay solid and not fight, but I think that pincering and using the existing stones to make white life difficult was a better idea.

G:I don't think so, O3 is doable];W[rp];B[qq];W[rq];B[qk];W[on]
;B[kp];W[lp]C[I have the feeling that L4 was too high and not joseki. White answer really gave me some headache in trying to understand what to do. A plan in my mind was to keep influence towards the left side hoping that the inner group could live. I thought about attacking the stone in N4 or N5 but was not in the mood for a fight probably.

G: L4 is too high, better L3, but the real mistake is after a couple of move]

(;B[io];W[kr];B[df]C[After a not so satisfying exchange in the bottom right I decided to reapproach the upper left but should have probably consolidated at L17 before. Here in this sequence I was waiting for the right occasion to go to D10 but was anticipated by white.

G: You like to play on fourth line but it can drive you in some complication.]

(;B[cp]C[Bricolo [9k\]: C 4 is the only good move in that situation .... well]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[aq]LB[gj:A]C[Was there a way to avoid white from living there?
Anyway here my idea is to attack the D10 group but again, finding the right timing was tricky and I failed in the end.

G: Is difficult because of E3. See variation. Anyway notice D10 group, you can play near A to put pression on D10 group, even if there is the C12 weakness. I notice that you leave many cutting point, sometines is better makes group stronger than take big point.]
;B[nc]C[Bricolo [9k\]: Yes, of course, in that corner joseki, starting when I play on the 3-3  C3 ... I live

;B[re];W[rc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qa];B[kd]C[Is this too high? Probably I am concentrating a lot on influence rather than territory... :-/

G: Yes too high another time.];W[jc];B[jd];W[kc];B[lc];W[id]
;B[jf]C[I liked my situation here, White will try to reduce the upper right but I managed to parry and kill (I don't think it was a mistake on his part but mostly a teaching sequence to see if I could kill).]

;W[gj];B[hj];W[hk];B[gk];W[hl];B[fl];W[fi];B[fh]C[That is terrible I know, really did not see the double atari... and was probably the losing move, g12 was correct.

G: H12 better];W[hi]
(;B[gh]C[Here again, probably J10 was right, giving still some chances to seal white in.

G: sure. see variation];W[ij];B[jl];W[eq]C[From here onward the situation is terrible, those stones are weak and are under attack... the defence seems feasible with the option to still close white in but I did some more mistakes here and got the group dead :(

G: look at the ladder. See later];B[fq]C[here I should have played E4

G: No it's correct];W[ep]

C[Should have resigned here but we wanted to see the final points... there are other mistakes in the rest of the game but now it is mainly settling the sketched territories and the only thing is possible to find a way to stop the white from cutting his way into black mojo from L10 onward, but I failed there as well

[hq][gr][fs]C[In conclusion:
The appropriate timing for the moves are hard to aquire, and cames after many, many games and it's a consequence of many things: read out big points on the board, read out group status and a good undertanding of the direction of play. 

So my advice are

1) Play less on fourth line (influence is hard to master)
2) Don't leave cutting point
3) Read out the ladder

I hope you enjoies my review, if you have any question please ask me.
Bye
