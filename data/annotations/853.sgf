C[aheimlich: hello reviewer! this is probably the best game i've played in quite a while (at least i feel good about it ;)...  i have been around 11k-13k on igs for about a month -- i was at 13k when i played this game.  my opponent had their rank set to 11k, but i'm pretty sure they're quite a bit stronger than that. since i played white without komi, this was quite a challenge. i hope you enjoy reviewing it as much as i enjoyed playing it :-)  --- Mark Fyffe (aheimlich and buckyyowza on igs)


ug: Hello! This is my first review - I hope that my comments are of some use.
Please, don't take my words too serious, I'm only 7k on IGS, and I don't
feel I know much about this game ... So, read something like "I think ..."
before each of my statements.];B[dp];W[qd];B[qp];W[ed];B[od]
;W[ld];B[qc]C[ug: That's unusual. More often one sees p14 or q13.]
;W[rc];B[pc]
(;W[qf]C[ug: See also the variation.];B[of];W[ph];B[oh]C[ug: Maybe black should have considered m14 or k16 instead.]
;W[pi];B[qk]
(;W[op]C[ug: I think this is not perfect. A move like q6 is just what black would like to play to settle
his group. You should not force him to do what he wants to do anyway.
See the variations.];B[pn]C[ug: Looks good for black.];W[lp]
C[ug: You could consider attaching at r3 first. Black will exchange s3 for q3, then you can  extend a little farther.]
;B[oq]C[ug: Now black takes the corner. But k4 is maybe even more interesting  for black]
;W[nq];B[pq];W[oo]C[ug: This move seems a bit pointless. Why not extend , to j3 say, with
an approach move to the lower left corner as a possible follow-up.
The cut at o4 would be rather small at this stage, as blacks group is
strong anyway.];B[oi]
(;W[rj]C[ug:This cannot be good. You play at the second line to secure a few points,
and black is allowed to build a wall on the oudside.  I would play q10 instead.
 This would give the white group a way into
the center, and b couldn't connect his groups.];B[qj];W[rh]
C[ug: Again, I would rather try q10.];B[jp];W[jq];B[iq]
(;W[ip]C[ug: That is too aggressive. L3 instead would be better (see variation).]

(;B[hq]
(;W[kq]C[ug: As you played j4, you must fight now. This is much too easy for black.
(see variation).];B[io];W[dm];B[hp]C[ug: This is a perfect result for black! It will be a tough game for white.]

(;W[lm]C[ug: I would be tempted to take one of the big points instead, e.g. d11.
The white group does not seem to be in immediate danger.];B[jd]

(;W[pg]C[ug: Black need (and should) not respond to this move, but play l14 or something similar.  And even if black answers as he did, I think this is aji keshi and not good for white:  blacks wall becomes
stronger, and white gains more or less nothing from the move at q13. It might be much
more importatn for white to have a peep at o13, from the outside, later on.
Thus white should play m14  now.];B[og];W[je]C[ug: Maybe better to simply jump out with m14.  The black k16 stone
is not so strong, and attaching will help black.];B[kd]C[ug: I don't know if thats's good. It seems a bit
vulgar. I would imagine b j15 instead, then w l15, b h16.];W[ke]
;B[le]
(;W[lf]C[ug: Compare also the variation.];B[me];W[id];B[lc]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[ie];B[cd]
(;W[ce]C[ug: Let's have a look at the other moves white could choose (see variations).
But your choice seems to be all right.]
(;B[dd]C[ug: This is unusual. Compare the variations.];W[de]
;B[ec]
(;W[fc]TR[fd]LB[fd:A]C[aheimlich: would i be better to play at A (f16) to work on my moyo rather than starting a fight?

ug: I think this is ok (see the variation).];B[ee];W[fd];B[be]
;W[bf]
(;B[cf]C[ug: The variation might be better for black.];W[df]
;B[cg];W[bd];B[dg]
(;W[ef]C[ug: This seems to help black more than white, see the variation.]
;B[eg];W[ff];B[bg]
(;W[cc]C[ug: This doesn't seem good. If you want to be sure that the corner is
yours, play at a15. But maybe an extension around c10 is even more interesting.  I think, black should play around d9 now, because ...]

(;B[af]C[ug: ... now again, you could extend yourself (see variation).]

(;W[bc];B[dk]C[ug: Now white has a problem ...];W[fm];B[im]
;W[fp];B[fq];W[cp]
(;B[cq];W[do]C[ug: maybe better at c5]
(;B[ep]C[ug: better at d3];W[eo];B[co]C[ug: As we see, this is not good for black. b4 might be better.]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cr]C[ug: If black had played d3 instead of e4, he could now play b2,
and the white group would be in serious trouble];W[cn]C[ug: Fine - now the white group is settled (with a little help
of black, indeed).];B[ic];W[hc];B[ib];W[hb];B[jb];W[mf];B[ne]
C[ug: Black could have played elsewhere.]
(;W[mk]C[ug: This doesn't achieve much. Before every move, you should ask yourself,what you want to accomplish with this move. For example, you might want to
- defend a weak group of your own,
- attack a weak group of your opponent, or
- take territory

Your move doesn't defend nor attack, and it's hard to imagine how
it could take territory.
At this point, all groups are settled. You are behind in territory, so the question
is where you could get some more points.  In the center, this will be difficult,
because it is still open, and there are several strong black groups that will
help black rease any white territory there. Nevertheless, you should try that,
maybe with a move like n11 or m11. Another idea is to grab some points at the left  side with c9. See the variations.]
;B[rb]C[ug: Very big. Probably white should have played there himself.]
;W[ql];B[rk];W[ol];B[pl];W[pm];B[qm];W[om]C[ug: Nice sequence for white.]

(;B[pk]C[ug: s8 better];W[qn];B[rm];W[po];B[rn];W[qi]C[ug: too small]
;B[br];W[bn];B[bl]C[aheimlich: this is about where i started to realize i was in trouble :)


ug: Well, white is in trouble because he has less territory than black.
But the d5 group is perfectly secure: you can always get 2 eyes by playing at e7,
for example. Nevertheless, this is a big move for black.]

ug: white still has several ko threats (a13, b10), and black seems to have only one (g18),
so black can't win the ko anyway.];W[se];TW[aa][ba][ca][da]

Black wins by 6.5.

aheimlich: thank you for taking to the time to look over my game, i hope to hear your comments soon ;-)

ug: This was a good game, which was not decided by a single great blunder,
but only through several minor mistakes, and which was quite close.
In the beginning, black had quite an advantageous position, but you managed
to settle your group in the lower left very well, and got quite many points in  the endgame around f8 and around n6.

The key points where white could have played better were

- w 16: Don't help black to settle his groups, but try to connect several weak groups.
- w 24/26: Don't play on the second line so early, but get your groups out in the center,
so that they can participate in the fighting. Especially in hindsight, that should be very clear:  The group you protected with s10 has now only 5 points of territory!
- w 30/32: you must not allow black to get such a wonderful ponnuki
- you should have taken care of your d7 stone earlier - black could have attacked  more severely.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
