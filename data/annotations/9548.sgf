C[Dear reviewer,
Although we tried to concentrate on the game, we often end up playing for fun, with avoidable mistakes and comments (I deleted the chatting here).
We welcome any suggestion, especially during the fuseki.

milo:

Ok, thanks for the game.];B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qn];W[nq]

(;W[oc]LB[nc:A][oc:C][nd:B][od:D]C[This is a mistake.  White can get into trouble by playing too close to the Kobayashi opening (C + D).  The standard move is A, although B is also ok.]

;W[aj]C[White played too close to the Kobayashi opening.  White should remember to play farther away.

Perhaps black did not choose the correct joseki in the upper left.  black was strong in that area, but white's attack of the C12 stone led to a big white corner in the lower left, and an white invasion of the corner in the upper left.  Also the M13 stone didn't seem to work out.

White missed a chance to live in black's moyo, and also might have made more trouble for the top black group if white had not played H16, a move that he could probably see didn't work, in his eagerness to cut black.

When white played A14, black needs to remember that the group only has one eye.  As soon a the group is enclosed, black needs to make two eyes.

Thanks for the game.  Please remember that my advice is not perfect.

Cheers
