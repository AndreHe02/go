AB[pd][dp];C[One of my first true game, I played as Black, I'm a beginner and 17k is the lowest rank on pandanet server, I think I'm below that.

P: Hi my name is Paco. My KGS nick is flintstone and sometimes Blas]
;W[cd];B[pp];W[cn]
(;B[en]TR[dn][fq]C[P: I would not say this is a bad move at your level, but the marked ones are more usual, I think that better, and almost all, will avoid problems.

Bear in mind that with E6 you dont buil a base for your stones an in the future they can be attacked.

E16 is OK too. I personally prefer to settle D4 stone an then attack.

See variations

P: Pay attention to variations. Sometimes I will not tell where is one.]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr]TR[nc][ed][qf][qn][nq]C[P: This is a typical move at your level, and is bad. People at your level use to answer every move the opponent do. You have to get used to look at the whole boardand see if there are bigger moves. 

D4 group is not in danger,so c2 is not really necesary. You are not really attacking because c6 group will not die.So C2 dont have really a purpose.Is not doing anything. Take a look at the marked stones. E16 is the best I think.]
;W[jq]
(;B[hp]TR[lq]C[P: C3 group is strong. You should necerplay near strong groups. Is better to drive your opponent against thickness. See variation]
;W[mq]
(;B[np]C[P: Bad.You dont really attack and dont make territory.See variation]
;W[nq]
(;B[op];W[hr];B[gq]C[P: Not necesary because your group is difficult to kill, and the territory you are making is little.]
;W[qj];B[pk]C[Oripy : I put that stone on the side of my wall, is it a good way to do it ? Maybe the stone at Q16 is weak and I should have played at Q11 ?

P:Your stone at q16 is not still weak. But normally is better to driveyour opponent toward your thickness, with r12 for example.

q11 is too close to r10, and will lead to a fight in wich he will live or scape stealing territory. It is also too high the fourth line. The third line of r12 makes you assure territory and attack at the same time. Always look for movements with more than one purpose.]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[qg];B[pf]C[P: Again you are lettinghim get into the corner. r15 is better]
;W[re]C[P: You see. And you dont have territory.];B[rc];W[qe]
;B[pe];W[jc];B[kd]TR[hc]C[P: Your typical mistake: too high and wrong direction]
;W[kc];B[lc]C[Oripy : I think this isn't the best move... what can I do better ? K14 to prevent escape to the center ? M16 ?]
;W[jd];B[ke];W[je];B[kg];W[jg];B[ji]C[P: This move is with what purpose?]
;W[ed]
(;B[ek]C[P:And this? You should be able to always answer to that question with:

a) im making territory
b) In attacking and hope I will kill, or make myself stronger, or make him weak
c) Im invading

See variation];W[ck];B[eh];W[ch]C[P: He has made a lot of territory and you nothing]
;B[ff]C[P: I think heÂ´s winning this game because I dont think you'll be able to ensure territory in the low center. He will surely invade. So if you dont do anything, you will loose. It makes no sense to play pasive and let things go. You have to do anything. If it doesnt work, you will loose, but at least you will have a chance. But if you dont do anything at all, you will have no chance.]
;W[df];B[kp];W[kq];B[lp]C[Oripy : I think that this move was a mistake, maybe M3 is better ?]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[qq];B[qp]C[Oripy : What about P3 or Q3 instead ?]
;W[pq];B[rq];W[oq];B[sp];W[rr];B[sr];W[rs];B[ir]C[Oripy : Is there a way to cut the White stone at H2 here ? J2 is hopeless I think]

;W[mk];B[nm];W[ml]C[How can I fight against such shapes ? White I so strong with his group...]
;B[kl];W[mm];B[mn];W[lm];B[kn];W[km];B[jm]C[P: From now on you make some tactical mistakes that I prefer not comment because you will improve just playing and paying more attention]

(;B[cl]C[If what you want is to prevent him to make a big moyo in the left, this is a real attack.Maybe you will not kill c6 but you will make teritory in the left, or at least he will not make it.]

(;B[oq]))
(;B[oq]C[P: This is better, because you take territory in the corner and prevent him to slide there. He has still to move, because he's not alive yet]

(;B[lq];W[jo];B[lo];W[jm];B[gq]C[P: You will not kill k3, but he will not kill c3 and you will take territory in the right. Later you can attack k3, because he doesnt have eyes shape. Your groups are difficult to attack.]
