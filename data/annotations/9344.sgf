C[JK: Hi, I'm Josh King.  I marked all my comments with my initials to discriminate them from your own.

I saw you were wanting to have a territory based game, and made most of my comments toward that goal.  My last comment is on 221.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[qq];W[dq];B[oc]C[My initial idea in the opening was to try to be a bit more territory-focused, as I had previously played several games where I focused on influence.  Thus, the 3-3 and 3-4 moves.

JK: I think it's good to have a notion of influence and territory and which moves hilight which of these concepts.  Also, good to explore different openings and see what works for you, and have some thought of why.]
;W[qj]C[I think this move is challenging your territory. Imagine if a black stone was at R10 instead of a white one.  It would be more formidable as a right side territory (thought not insurmountable).]
;B[cc]C[Again, trying to get territory while I can.

JK: This early on, I think a 3-3 joseki is too little to go for and gives up too much to white.  You have three areas of stones on the board, and they are all disconnected.
I like a 3-3 joseki either when you have some friendly stones nearby or when the wall you give your opponent won't do much.  WIth entirely empty board in the area, I think you give up too much for the territory you'll make.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[bd];W[be];B[bb];W[ed];B[eb];W[fb];B[db]
;W[gc];B[qn]C[JK: This is a good territory based move.];W[po]
;B[qo];W[pq];B[pp];W[op];B[qp];W[or];B[co]C[I felt this was bigger than trying to continue to develop on the bottom right.  I think there is shape in the bottom right to exploit, but I hope to come back to it later.]

(;W[ep]
(;B[hq]C[Trying to pincer?

JK: this is not a good territory based move.  I think B3 for the corner or C8 vicinity for the side would be consistent with your plan.
    From the question mark, it seems like you didn't have a plan.  A pincer is a fighting move, so you should be ready for one if you play it.]
;W[cl]C[He does a counter-pincer, and I'm not sure what to do...

JK: L3 looks good if you want to continue with your territory plan.  You can abandon C5 if you don't know what to do with it, or you think saving it will take too  much work for too little profit.]
;B[en]C[I have the general idea that jumping out and putting pressure on the stones below might be good.

JK:  This idea abandons your plan of territory.
     To jump out you would need somewhere to go.  If you focus on territory early on, then you give up influence, and usually that means you will be weak in the center and in battles.
     With E6, it looks like you are willing to fight, but C8 can easily defend with the help of the wall at the top and the D3 E4 stones have the corner to build a good position.]
;W[dn]C[For moves 29-32, I'm not really sure what the right way to do this would have been.  I'm not happy with this result, and would like some advice on how to improve it.

JK: White's plan is to cut C5 from E6, and he does so.  Since this is not in your original territory plan, fighting advice seems appropriate.
    When white plays a move like this, which can split apart your stones without a response, make him work for it.  Play D5 and ruthlessly attack until you're dead or have made life.  I think it will make a more enjoyable game.]

(;B[cq]C[Now I have to try to live, so I jump into the corner.]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[do];B[cn];W[cm];B[bm];W[bl];B[am]C[I think this makes me alive here.  Was I alive sooner?  Or am I not really alive yet?]
;W[jq];B[go]C[JK: Two knight moves at once.  The problem with these moves is that they can be cut.  H5 or H6 would be more solid.  H3 needs a base or needs to be abandoned.]
;W[fn]C[JK: White is trying to split your knight move again.  Make him work for it!]

(;B[br]C[I think this makes me alive here.  Was I alive sooner?  Or am I not really alive yet?

JK: I thought that If white had gone here, that life would have been more challenging.  But I can't make the third variation at 44 work in white's favor.  Might have been alive already.
     I would have liked B2 earlier, if it was going to be played.  Rather than G5.]
;W[dr];B[eo]C[Maybe F5 would have been better?  Can't remember what I was trying to do with this, but it doesn't seem good.

JK: F5 does seem better.  The white at F6 is looking to split your knight's move.  You should make white work to do that, or get something out of the exchange.]
;W[fo];B[em];W[dm];B[hm]C[Trying to pin white in, and build something facing to the right.

JK: Here's another knight's move.  I think white might try to cut it.]
;W[fm];B[el];W[gn];B[ho];W[hn];B[io];W[in];B[jn];W[im];B[jm]
C[So I have something facing righ, but I'm worried about my four stones on line E.

JK: You do have a bit facing right, but it is weak at K5.  The stones at E are not doing anything for you.  I think they would be a good candidate for abandonment.  Recognizing when to abandon stones is a good skill.  And maybe later they can recover some aji.]
;W[hl];B[fl];W[il];B[gi]C[Worrying about those five stones below, I jump out, hoping I can connect up.

JK: The hope to connect up contradicts the earlier goal of a territory based game.  Without earlier prepared influence, there's nothing to connect up with.]
;W[fk];B[ek];W[ej];B[gk];W[fj];B[gl];W[gj];B[hk];W[jj];B[hj]
;W[ih];B[ce]C[Done trying to link up for now, I notice I think I have a ladder breaker, so I play C15, hoping to get something on the left side.]
;W[cf];B[fh];W[hh];B[de];W[df];B[ee];W[fe];B[ef];W[bf];B[dg]
;W[eg];B[ff];W[dh];B[dj];W[ei];B[eh];W[di];B[cg]C[I know I can take at  F13 at any time, so the ladder works for me, so I think I can take the four stones above me on line 14 and 15.

JK: well played];W[bg];B[ch];W[ci];B[bh];W[bi];B[ah];W[ai];B[fg]
;W[hi];B[cj];W[bj]C[Somewhere in here (I forget where exactly) I realize that the big black group in the middle is dead.]
;B[jl];W[ik];B[ij]C[JK: I don't like this. (I think you must have realized the group was done after this move.]
;W[jk];B[om]C[So... now time to come back to the bottom right.

JK: I like how this can help your stones on line K or extend your stones on R.  Multipurpose.]
;W[qf]C[JK: a big extension.  Black should have had something like this earlier in a territory focused game.]
;B[oo];W[no];B[on];W[lc]C[JK: A second big extension by white!  Black should have gotten one of these.]
;B[qh]C[Pincer, because I can't let him take the whole upper right, I don't think.  I have to try to either connect over the top or underneath.

JK: Not sure that this is a pincer, because you put your own stone in a pincer like situation at the same time.  A play like this says to me "I'm ready to attack R14 or R10, whichever one doesn't get protected with the follow up."  I think either stone can run to some nearby white stones if needed, though.]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[pi];B[pj];W[pk];B[oj];W[qk]
(;B[ok];W[pg];B[ge]C[I notice a defect over here, and I think this stuff is attackable.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fc];B[hc];W[hb];B[ic];W[ad];B[bc];W[gf];B[fa]
;W[ib];B[gb]C[I take just because I'm a little worried about liberty counts, I know I have some cuts of my own to worry about.  I'm not sure this was right, there may have been something more efficient.

JK: If you don't see a sure thing later on, then I think taking it now is good.]
;W[jc];B[kk]LB[je:A][ne:B][nh:C]SQ[jc][lc][pg][ih][ph][jj]C[So, where do I have territory?  Not too many places.  I want to try to make some in the middle.

JK: my friends used to say "There's neve territory in the middle."  I think it should be there's only territory in the middle if you have a framework set up for it.  White alread has some good influence towards the middle with the marked squre stones.  I think the best you can hope is drive thorns into that base.  You have some good positions to do so, I think at the letters.]

(;W[jo]C[So with this, I try to defend what I've got.];B[jp]
C[I think maybe I should have just played L5, to be consistent with my previous strategy, and risked losing the stones on line 5.  Maybe I could have killed the white stones in the bottom right in exchange?  Not sure.  I end up living, but I get nothing from it.]
;W[ko];B[kp];W[lo];B[lp];W[mp];B[fp]C[JK: this doesn't do anything.  G3 immediately would be better.]

;W[kr];B[is];W[ks];B[hr];W[js];B[gs];W[ir];B[ji];W[ii];B[jr]
;W[ag];B[ir]C[I think this is bigger, but maybe its not?

JK: The stones at C13 were capturing C14 stones. It's a 20 point exchange.
    The stones at the bottom are about 34 point exchange, if lost.  They aren't capturing a group, and the other big ko threats, for black, would have utilized the stones at C13 against C11 group.
      I think it was an okay trade.];W[eg];B[ip]C[JK This is about a  5 pont move.  There are places on the board still worth more than 5 points.]
;W[ne]C[If you had played here, it would be good.];B[jh]C[I'm going to try pusing him around to build a right-facing wall... not sure how much good that will do me, but I want to start somewhere making some territory.]

;W[bo];B[bn];W[ri];B[cp];W[sh];B[kj]C[I can't find another big ko threat.

JK: this move made your plan work.  If white had gone in here, the bit of territory in the middle you got would have been destroyed.  Thought I think total the territory in the middle might be at best around 15.

This is my last comment in the game.
Looks like the rest is mostly endgame.

I would recommend sticking more to a plan if you want to focus on certain aspects.  This game black strayed early from the stated goal of a territory based game.  
Thanks for letting me review your game, and I hope you found it helpful!]
