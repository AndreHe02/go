C[RS: Hi Ben. I'm Rex Santoro. I'm rasa on the Dragon Go Server where I'm 7k. Let me say, if you know someone with a higher rank then me, then please let him review it. In any case, I will do my best.]

;B[cl]C[At this point should i have made a different move? I wasn't sure about this one

RS: No, this is very good since W didn't play on the left side. I'd prefer c9 or c10 though.]
;W[jd]
(;B[pj]C[Or this one

RS: This is also very good. Again, since I'm a more territory oriented player, I'd prefer r10 or r11. With this move, limiting W's extensions from the top and bottom. W now has the choice to extend from the top or bottom, and B will extend 2 spaces in the opposite direction creating a living group.]
;W[qm]
(;B[om]C[Was there a way to continue here or was this move just a lost cause?

RS: I'm assuming you were wanting to stop W from getting a moyo in the bottom right, but because of Bp7 you are limiting that quite a bit so you did accomplish your objective. The question is whether you need to play this now]
(;W[jp];B[dh]C[RS: Excellent! Your next big point should be h17, This will be sente and you can really increase your moyo.]
;W[lp]
(;B[kn];W[io]C[RS: Your previous move, Bl6, is starting to push W into your sphere of influence where you can make a huge moyo. I would have played p5 instead of l6.]
(;B[in]C[RS: This attack is not really necessary. For me, you attack only when you know exactly what you will get: kill a group, cut 2 groups apart, reduce W's territory. Your attack here only pushes W into your right side moyo.

Check the variation.];W[go]

If I were W, and I do not know *exactly* how to kill W, then I would play at g9, forcing W to run into the center AND making sure territory for B on the left.]

Was resigning a good idea? Did i have a chance of winning?

RS: Actually your ahead by 7.5 points, and if W plays optimally, you still win by 2.5 points! Of course, at our level this is very hard to count the score so exactly when playing live. So what do we do? Simply put, guess. Practice this by looking at finished games, guessing what the score may be and then have the computer tell you the score. If you're off, look at the game and figure out where you went wrong. This will take looking at a lot of games, but you will get better. For me, if I were B, I would guess I was winning if I could play s8. I would guess if W plays r9 or s10, B would loose, but I would be wrong.

Here's a possible scenerio where you win by 7.5. See my notes for big endgame moves.]

(;W[kr]C[RS: Even if W plays a or b, you still win, but it is very close.]
;B[rl];W[ql];B[rk];W[rm];B[pk]C[RS: B+13.5!

Ok, Ben, I think I've done enough damage here. I hope I didn't confuse you even more. If you have any questions, please email me at Rex.Santoro@unodc.org.]
