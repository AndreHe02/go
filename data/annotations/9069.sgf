C[Hi I'm Andrew. Thank you for reviewing my game. I have been
playing for about 2 months. I have a trial version of Many Faces
of Go which is who I'm playing against in this game. I feel I did
really well, but would like to know some things that I can improve
on.

B: hi, I'm Bart. I'm about 7 kyu and will do the review. My comments start with B: Although you're playing against a bot, I will refer to it as "he", or "white", in the comments.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qj];W[eq]
(;B[dj]LB[ce:B][de:A]C[B: it's more common to approach at A or B. If white gets this point, he has 2 secure corners, and you still have 2 open corners.
See variations for two common responses.]
(;W[cl];B[jd];W[ce];B[jp]LB[qc:A][el:C][qo:B]C[At this point I'm feeling pretty well. I have a good bit of the board
covered and see that White has a couple of corners secured.

B: yes, you have influence on the board. But white can invade at A and B and live there. Or play the big move C. You then end up with some territory on the side and maybe in the middle. While white has almost 4 corners and komi, so he wins with more points.]
;W[nc]C[B: you're lucky white approaches on the side where you are already strong.]
;B[oc];W[lc]
(;B[le]LB[gc:2][jc:1][lc:C][jd:B][dj:A]C[Wasn't sure how to respond. That's the thing with me. Once the
corners and sides have been taken I am unsure how to respond
to things.

B: that's normal :-) I still have it from time to time. You can always fall back to 3 easy guidelines:
1. do you have a weak group? if so, strengthen it.
2. does your opponent have a weak group? If so, attack it.
3. not 1 or 2, then play a big move.

Running these rules, I'd say A and B are weak. Your move strengthens B, and it attacks the white C-group, so it's a good move. Usual would be 1 or 2. With 1, you prevent white making an ease base with K18 and can then make your own base. You both end up with a small group. Problem with 2 is that white can get into your base with K18, and there are already white stones in the corner, so you have limited space. So your move is good, I think.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[dn]SQ[ql]C[B: and for white I would play around R8 fist, before playing tenuki.]

(;B[dg]C[B: refering to the 123 guide again, this is again a good move.
Another option would be to attack white at R7.];W[lq]
(;B[lp]LB[qo:A]C[Was this a good response? What could be better? I felt this move
sort of boxed white in while also making a better connection
between my stones.

B: yes, I think that's a good idea. A is still weak and you want to keep white out of the center. But... white can link up his stones and probably live. See variation.
So I go back one stone and see if you do it different. See other variations.]

(;W[hp];B[iq];W[hq]
(;B[ip]C[B: what's the idea about this move?
If white plays there, you can always react. See variation.]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[hd];B[ic]C[B: good. Keep the white stones separated.]
;W[hc];B[ib];W[hb];B[ha]C[B: later on, you have a big follow up.]
;W[qf]C[B: as white, I would have played R8 or invade the corner at R17]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[oe];W[qh];B[pi];W[ph]
(;B[oi]C[B: why not P12?];W[oh];B[nh];W[of]
(;B[pe]C[B: not really needed. See variations.];W[ga];B[ia]
;W[gb];B[hr]LB[nf:C][bg:B][ho:A]C[B: some alternatives to your move. A increases your area and reduces white. B strengthens your group on the left. C keeps white out of the center.]
;W[is];B[hs];W[nq];B[oq];W[ql];B[pn];W[po];B[oo]
(;W[mf];B[me];W[lf];B[kf];W[kg];B[je];W[jg];B[de]C[At this point I decided it was time to try and attack White's upper
right corner.

B: yes, you can reduce there, but the corner is alive. And white can make your stones heavy.]

(;W[qn];B[on];W[ch];B[cg];W[bh];B[bg];W[ol];B[nm];W[nl]
(;B[mn]C[B: this is a bit submissive. I think you can play N8.]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[mk];B[mm];W[lk]
(;B[lm]C[Was unsure of how to respond. Was this a good spot to play? If
not what would be better?

B: my first reaction would be: cut at O9. See variation.];W[km]
;B[kl];W[kk];B[jl];W[jm];B[im];W[in];B[jn];W[kn];B[jo];W[il]
;B[jk]C[Noticed that two sets of stones were in trouble. Decided to save
the bigger group.

B: good idea... only I think white could have gotten both groups.  See variation at 98.]
;W[ik];B[jj];W[ij];B[kj]
(;W[hm];B[nk]C[Decided to try and cut to see if it would pay off.]

(;W[ok]C[B: this is a mistake by white. I think he should have given up the lower stones and take the other part. See variation.]
;B[nj];W[mi];B[mj]C[Now I'm happy. White's group is surrounded. :)

B: yes, I would be happy too. Good result for black.];W[ki]
C[Was not worried about white playing this stone. So I decided to
play tenuki.

B: true. Another white mistake.];B[ci];W[ji]C[Since White decided to persist I decided that I NEEDED to cap
white's stones.

B: yes. I have no clue what white is tryoing to do. You can still cut at J11.]
;B[lj];W[li]
(;B[lk]C[Was this a necessary move? I felt that if white played here my
stones would have died. And if not died at least lose a lot of their
value.

B: if they do not die, they do not lose any value, because white cannot reduce the area there.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[eg]
(;B[ei]C[Looking back I think that I should have played at D14 instead of
here.

B: see variation. Better to play E14 instead.];W[df];B[cf];W[cd]
;B[ef];W[fg]
(;B[gi]LB[cf:A][ei:B]C[Was this a good move? If not what would be better?

B: you have two groups in trouble, A and B.
You can use your move to:
1 make eyes for one group,
2 connect to a living group
3 capture some white stones.

1 saves only one of your groups, 2 is not possible (white H13), so try 3. B11, see variation.]
;W[ff];B[ee]LB[ce:1][eg:2]C[B: white stones 1 and 2 make this a false eye. So adding E15 doesn't help much.]
;W[fe];B[ed]C[B: and you cannot connect to another group, so thias move also doesn't do much.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[fc];B[ge]C[This move was a big mistake I realize now after the fact.

B: if you didn't spot B11, then G15 is not helping you. You still need 3 moves to capture white, and white also needs 3... and it's white's turn, so he captures first.]
;W[gd]
(;B[df]C[Was this necessary? (sorry if there's a lot of questions)

B: no problem, questions are good.  To answer it: no, only after white plays D16, you may need to respond.
And take a look at the variations.]
(;W[gq]C[B: ow, white should capture your group with D16.]
(;B[cq]LB[fg:A]C[Thought I would try and invasion here, but now I really regret it.

B: as long as white responds, there's nothing lost. If you do not invade, it is white territory. If you play a stone and white responds, it's -1 for you (a dead stone), and -1 for white (he played in his own territory) if your stone is dead.
But you can now win the capture on the A group.];W[bq];B[br]
;W[cr];B[dq];W[dp];B[dr];W[er];B[cs];W[ar];B[bs];W[bp];B[es]
;W[fs]C[B: of course white doesn't want you to link up.];B[ds]
C[B: but don't respond if you can only make 1 eye. Better to play somewhere else now.]
;W[ho];B[kq];W[gh];B[fi]C[B: if you want to make eyespace, F9 might be better. Or G9.]
;W[hi];B[gk];W[hh]
(;B[nf]C[B: you know white will play O13, so he will connect. Better to play O11 instead and take away some white points while he connects. See variation.]
;W[ng];B[ni];W[mh];B[ne];W[he]C[B: don't see the point of that move.]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[if];W[ig];B[dl];W[jf];B[ke];W[ie];B[id];W[cm]
;B[ck]C[B: good. That makes some room for eyes.];W[bi];B[bj]
;W[gr];B[js]C[Could not ignore the threat to my two stones.]
;W[nd];B[md];W[mc]
(;B[kc];W[kb]C[At this point I am nervous about white's invasion. I think for at
least 30 seconds before each move I make. Feel free to point out
anything I could do better during this fight.

B: it's good to think about that. As I said earlier, white has lost nothing if the invasion fails, and you have lost a lot if it succeeds. Only thing I can point out is that it is usually better to push your opponent towards your strong wall and keep him out of the corner. So playing P18 instead of L17, for example.]
;B[jb];W[lo]
(;B[mq]TR[mo][no][mp]C[B: white threatens to invade your area. If white plays the variation N4, you lose some territory.]

(;W[nr];B[or];W[mr];B[mp];W[mo];B[lr];W[no];B[np];W[ko]C[B: not needed by white]
;B[kp]C[B: and no need to respond right now];W[gl];B[fl];W[fm]
;B[fk];W[em];B[el];W[hk];B[gj];W[ej]C[This worried me a bit, but I decided not to let it shake me.]

(;B[dk]C[B: or take a liberty from the white group by playing D11]
;W[di];B[cj];W[dm];B[ai]C[B: if you're ahead its ok to make this move. If you're behind play it only after white tries to capture your group.]

(;B[bn]C[Thought I would be able to cut white right here.

B: and as you see, that doesnt work. And I think white is now alive on the right side, so you might want to keep him as small as possible.]

B: yes, S14 was good.];W[sg];B[nb]C[B: if the white group is dead, dont play in your own territory. Only if you're unsure and are ahead.

;B[pc];W[im];B[ln]C[B: J7 was a defense against that atari, so it's not an atari anymore. So a 0 point move.]
;W[sb];B[ep]C[Thought I would attempt an invasion. Looking back I realize it was
futile.

B: agreed. But there is an evil snapback on the board where you can get 10 white stones. Do you see it?]

;W[ps];B[pr];W[tt];B[tt]C[Looking at this afterward I realize that a stone at T7 would have
killed white's group there and secured me A LOT more points. I
came out with a win which is great, but I feel like I could have
done A LOT better. Thank you once again for reviewing my
game.
-Andrew 17 kyu

B: yes, T17 was the snapback. I hope to have answered your questions and show you some points.
Opening: don't be too certain about what becomes your territory if you play high stones (on the 4-4 point for example).
Middle game: went pretty good
End game: don't always respond to white. If you do not need to respond, you can play a big move elsewhere.
Overall: well played.

It's good to play against a (computer) opponent of equal strength to build confidence, but if you want to see if your move are solid, try playing against stronger players. You will lose most games, but they show you where you went wrong, so you learn more from it.]
