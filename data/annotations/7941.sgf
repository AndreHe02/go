torrique [2k\]: salut];W[fq]C[jasper2 [7k\]: salut];B[dn]C[Hello reviewer!

I played black in this game against a stronger opponent and lost unfortunately. I'd like to know where my mistakes were, because looking at the game myself I can't really see where i lost it...

I've put some questions in the game, marked with N's

Thanks for the review

michael: hi naftali, I will be reviewing your game today. I hope despite my lack of strength and experience, you will find it insightful!]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[cf]C[N: should I answer this move? or try and punish W's tenuki on the bottom side?

michael: YES, white should not have tenuki. His bottom two stones are in need of and extension and he risks a bad result. see variation]

;B[ge];W[nq]C[Variation, see comments]
(;B[jq];W[cr];B[jo]C[N: was this move a mistake? the idea was to put pressure on both of W's groups on the bottom side of the board, but i think it didn't really work out

michael: yes I don't think  K3 and K5 add much value. Though white's two groups are split, they are easily alive. Also, if white were to connect the two groups himself at K3, then you can easily cause trouble at H3 or M3. see variation at O3]

;W[bk];B[pn];W[qr];B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[ip];B[lq];W[lr];B[kr]
;W[mr];B[jp];W[nc]C[N: I was having a difficult time thinking of the best answer to this approach.
I thought maybe Q14 or P17 are better than what I played because then I get a big moyo on the right

michael: R2 is crucial. Life or death for white.

But I think your suggestion is right. I like Q14 more than P17. Although if you're going for moyo on the right side. Why not O16? see variation]
(;B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[pb]C[N: and maybe here H17 or J17 woulde be good because it closes off W's group on the upper left?

michael: I agree, closing off is a fairly big move, but A is big too! If you wanted to close off, I would try B. See variations]
(;B[qc];W[jc];B[le];W[qo];B[qn];W[rq];B[ro];W[qi];B[oi]C[michael: I feel like this move is too weak. P11 does not extend black's group, and white's group is most likely alive so it doesn't add too much pressure to R11. Also R14 group is in danger.]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[rg]C[N: at this point it looks like W has at least 2 or 3 weak groups on the board, while B has thickness all over the place. What is the best way to attack?

michael: you are right, white has many weak groups. See variations!]
(;B[qf];W[rf];B[re];W[ng];B[ph];W[qk];B[je]C[michael: this doesn't add much pressure to white. I guess you are trying to build moyo in the central region, but to accomplish this is very difficult. Especially if white n13 group can extend into the center. Also white F3 group can jump into the center. Defending central moyo is difficult. The best moves are when you attack WHILE building moyo. I think i prefer G17 more]

(;B[bo];W[ci]C[michael: I would have liked to see you try to win the ko. I feel like white has many weak groups and you could have used that to win this ko. If you had won this one, I believe you would have won the game. See variations.]
;B[di];W[dh];B[ei];W[eh];B[fi];W[ef];B[ee];W[dg];B[hc]C[Michael: too deep! if white has that formation, it's hard to break!]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[fb];B[ib];W[hd];B[ha]C[michael: eating wasn't necessary. every move counts, so becareful when you choose to eat something too fast! better to have extended at K18 to ensure that group remains safe! I think this group might have still ben alive and the game would have been in your favor]
;W[he];B[gg];W[hf];B[fg];W[jb];B[eb]C[Michael: don't invest in a dead group! you risk strengthening your opponent and the other groups that might still be alive!!!]

;W[ih];B[hi];W[jh];B[jg];W[li];B[kh];W[lh];B[mk]C[K11 is much more important than extension fo M9. Your upper right group is alive anyways!]
;W[ki];B[kg];W[ji];B[if];W[lp];B[lo];W[fo]C[michael: central moyo is hard to maintain, especially if white has so many open groups. I believe white has taken the lead by securing corners, and then invading the central moyo by using your weak groups in the upper right to his/her advantage. granted white can get away with his upper right group]
;B[rp];W[sr];B[hp];W[gp];B[hq];W[ho];B[io];W[hr];B[ir];W[gq]
;B[iq];W[kk];B[kj]C[Michael: this push is too weak. It dosn't accomplish anything. Better to make your groups strong first, and then attack your opponent. Better to have connected at J10, or discard the K10 stone as it is light]

;W[ik];B[hk];W[lk];B[nm];W[rc];B[sc];W[qe]C[N: How big is this ko? can W save both of his groups if he loses it?

michael: I can't give you a definite answer. but this ko seems really big. It could be worth the game since you are likely to kill white's group extending into the middle. The right group is likely alive. See variation if you won the ko]

C[michael: move A is not necessary, if white D9, you can go A6, if white go A6 you go D9. If you have such opportunities, use them to make the most of your moves. Don't conceed moves to you opponents! You can kill bottom right gruop or go B as you have already explored the options]

Some general advice: Overal it was a solid game except for the two times you conceded sente. Don't make unnecessary moves because you'll inevitablly fall behind. Those two small mistakes gave your opponent a window of opportunity and that opportunity allowed him to make his groups strong and yours weaker.  That eventually foiled your plan which seemed to be building a large moyo in the center. Since he had strong enough groups he was able to invade your central territory. Take a careful look at the end result. White's group in the center creeped in to take your moyo away!

The second point is, don't be afraid to fight ko! it seems like your shyness allows your opponent to take advantage of the situations. Just becase he is 5 stones stronger, does not mean you can't find reasonable KO threats against him! If anything those 5 handicaps should give you the edge!

I hope this review has been helpful to you! Thank for the opportunity!
