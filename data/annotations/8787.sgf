C[thoma [8k\]: hi have a good game
stmoritz [7k\]: hello];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cq]C[That's a weird move for white. After playing a hoshi, a san san? That's not consistant. Better play another hoshi, or a kakari.
You can turn your game over territory or over influence, but generally, for wanting both, you get none.]
;B[qk];W[jp];B[fc];W[df];B[jd];W[cj]C[Now one can see that C3 is useless and would be of much more use on the hoshi.]
;B[dp]C[Natural.];W[dq];B[ep];W[fq]
(;B[eq];W[er];B[dr]C[This move doesn't work. See variation.]
(;W[cr];B[fr]
(;W[cp]C[??? Letting Black capturing the stone here is unthinkable.]
;B[es];W[cn]
(;B[lp]C[See the alternative. This point is not bad but black can do better. His group isn't quite settled, got no eyes yet... He should play the solid move here.]
;W[jn];B[ln];W[jl];B[io];W[jo];B[ll]C[Black doesn't realize how thin he is in the bottom left now that he reinforced white. His peep at J5 accomplish nothing useful, plus it's strenthening white and it's weakening him, really. Look at the variation.
He gains territory while attacking, but white could kill his stones and get nearly as much. Not really a good exchange.]
(;W[jj];B[fe]C[Useless for now,Black has urgent points.

When playing, you always have to keep in mind four questions, and in the good order:
1/ Do I have a weak group? If yes, I strenghten him. 
2/ Do my opponent have a weak group? If yes, I attack him, not to kill it but to gain something during the attack: good position, territory, outside influence, sente...
3/Can I take a big point? If yes, I take it.
4/Do my opponent can take a big point? If yes, I stole it from him.

So here, Black should play to help his group in the bottom left.]
;W[hp]C[There are many variations to launch the attack here, many starting points; this move is one of them but maybe not the better. Hard to tell so early, but I would have preferred G3, by instinct.]
;B[cc]C[Not answering H4 is almost suicidal. Battle is taking place in the bottom left, not in the corner.]
;W[dc];B[ce]C[That move cannot be a good one. Black is helping White to cut him. White has to play C16 without thinking, and start to read AFTER the cut.]
(;W[de]C[White is being so passive here... A missed golden opportunity.]

Half the board will be his own, and the other half is still open for some invasion.]
