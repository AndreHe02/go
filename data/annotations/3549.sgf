C[Dear Reviewer,

this is a game I just played on KGS. Throughout the game, I was quite happy with it, until I made a stupid mistake at move 242. Later, I found out, that I didn't have an advantage, but was behind. And moreover, I had been falling behind quite a while ago. So I probably would have lost the game anyway, mistake or not.

My inability to judge the game roughly correct is a hindrance. And also, that I play what I feel to be good moves and fall behind while doing it makes me wonder... something seems to be wrong with my Go.

Maybe you can help me find out.

Thank you in advance.

(;B[nq];W[pn];B[kp];W[cj]C[I like this move, to prevent him from playing there.


Good. 5 was bad, it shoukd have been played in D10. see 1st variation.]
;B[cg];W[cn];B[co];W[dn]C[I was happy that he forced me to play in a way that fitted the situation well, I think. Now the extension c10 is exactly right.

Yes, but you must use your strength to attack the corner. You didn't and black got many points inthe lower left corner and the lower side]

(;W[fc];B[hc];W[fe]C[NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This group is weak and you leave it! Why don't you simply play C17 (sansan)?]

;W[pk];B[qk];W[ol];B[ql];W[pj]C[I should probably have connected at p9? Would have been better for my outside influence.

Not at all! You must try to keep the black group along the side. If black makes a mistake; you kill. And he wil make mistakes]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[nk];W[nl];B[nj];W[qi];B[ri];W[rh];B[sj]C[Now he lives on the side anyway and his group o9 is like a wedge.

He lives anyway ??????]

Not here!];B[ed];W[ec];B[cd];W[cg]C[I should have connected at f16 and let him capture to recapture immediately, I guess.

YES, of course];B[fd];W[bc];B[bb];W[gd];B[gc];W[af];B[bd]C[Too much profit for him and not enough for me.

In fact, there's no profit for you!]
(;W[le]C[To reduce his prospective territory and enlarge mine. Plus, to weaken his group o9.

Good strategy but wrong tactic];B[nh];W[ng];B[pi]C[I didn't understand this move at first but then...]
;W[oi];B[mg];W[mf];B[pg]C[... this follow-up move presented me with a tough choice - to connect at p13 or q12. After some thinking, I decided, that my smaller group r12 coule make it on its own.]

;B[kf];W[md];B[lg]
(;W[ff]C[Why? 16 is dead, leave it and play big points!

Now, you have two problems;
1- the lower side is very, very big
2- the black wall in the center, connected to a living group]

Playing in the center is too small because of the lower side]
;B[fh]C[bad for me


bad for everyone];W[eh]C[bad for everyone, like the previous move, but now the game is lost for you]
;B[fk];W[el];B[fo];W[fn];B[km];W[ip]C[I played here to set something up in order to capture his stone at o3. And reducing his territory while doing so seemded nice.]

;W[qo]C[WHY????
 it's a 2 points move. You need more to win, so you must take the sente to play elsewhere!!!]

;B[ei];W[di];B[ej];W[ek];B[dj];W[gk]C[I didn't connect at d9, because I thought, I should be cleverer. This move seemed nice to me, aiming at f10.]

See my advises on the last move];W[fj];B[gj]C[My plan was to cut off his 3 stones by playing at f11, but he prevented this.]
;W[fl];B[fi];W[hk]C[Now I thought I could capture his 2 stones, but...]
;B[fk];W[il];B[hm]C[... I didn't see the concequences of this response.]

Where should I concentrate to improve? I am rereading Otake's "Opening Theory Made Easy" right now, because I lately started to feel uneasy about my opening play again. I abandoned my plan to concentrate on fighting skills for now. I had started to read "Tesuji" and "Attack and Defense" from the Elementary Go Series.


"Opening Theory Made Easy" and books like that are very good but hard to learn. You should concentrate your work on tesujis, life and death problems. Improving your strength in fights is enough to win games like this one.
After, learn basic josekis.

Good luck!
I'll be glad to see you on IGS.

Best regards, Patrick (tap on IGS).



But maybe I am looking in the wrong direction - so I appreciate suggestions from you.

Thanks again.
