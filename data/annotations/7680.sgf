C[Hi. i was playing black in this game and have won by 23.5 point.
Though it has been 23.5 points solely due to mistake of my opponents in ko.

Personally i feel that i've  completely lost the initiative during the mid-game ( starting with W' invasion in the lower middle) and has been trying to keep up with my opponent.

So any suggestions on moves that i should've played in fuseki-midgame transition are much appreciated.

Also i pointed out some variations that i missed and have spotted only later during my own post-game review.

Thanks in advance.
Alexander.


Saurus: Hi Alexander. 
My name is Mark (Saurus), and I am about 6 kyu at the moment (6 kyu IGS and KGS). I will be reviewing your game for the black side.

In answer to your question regarding fuseki/midgame transition, there is an established order of priority as to which move is most important:

This is how to choose the best move (in order of priority) in the end of fuseki, and middlegame:
1) Play a move that affects the base of both your own and your opponent's groups, if it exists.
2) If you have a weakness, fix it.
3) If your opponent has a weakness, attack it.
4) If there are no weaknesses, play on the moyo frontier, on the border of your moyo and your opponent's moyo.
5) If there is no moyo frontier, play a big move on the side.

I will refer to these points through the game, and point out where they are applicable, as well as things that you have missed and incorrect strategies.

I have given you specific tasks during the game that you should do in order to improve.

I've commented on moves and strategies, and have also summarized key areas that you need to focus on at the end of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn]
(;B[cf]C[There are two issues I should address on this move:

1.) This move would have been catastrophic if white played correctly...

Consider the q3 stone. 3-4 shimaris have a specific purpose - to take the corner and make a side extension from it in the direction of its influence. The direction of influence from q3 is along the bottom. If you do not take control of the bottom, white has succeeded in making the stone feel rather useless. Furthermore, f3 was played to make territory along the bottom.

To make matters worse, white's play at d6 is saying: "I know you want the bottom, but I'm preparing to fight there to prevent you from having the whole bottom." The d4/d6 stones radiate influence along the bottom. Furthermore, the f3 stone is under attack.

Playing away from the bottom is as good as saying to white: "Two out of the three stones that I've played so far are to take the bottom, but go ahead and take it all. "

Playing along the bottom was the only correct strategy. B-k4 is the usual move in this position.

2.) White's 4-4 stones indicate that he wants to use influence and fight. D6 reinforces this intention. White has made no indication that he wants territory on the left. Playing at c7 forces a pincer, and forces him to make territory where there previously was none. This can only be good for white. It is way too early for an invasion. Rather focus on making your own base to attack from first, and then invade when you have something to run to.

[See variation\]]
(;W[nc]C[[See variation for what white could have done to destroy your potential\]]
;B[oc]C[White played w-o17 to make territory on the top. Forcing him to play w-o16 helps him to secure that territory.

B-p17 is only an option if you have a black stone at k17 or k16. In this case, white becomes a target to chase, so it's OK. 

However, as it stands, you're trading the top for the corner. Problem is, the top is bigger.

Much better was b-r14 or b-q14. (Although, b-k4 was still more urgent.)]
;W[nd];B[pg]C[Too far! 

Since white can now reduce you heavily with w-q15 (same as if you didn't have a stone at q13), this is the same as tenuki.

But if you're going to tenuki, rather play something much bigger like b-r5 or b-c8.

The best reply is b-q14.];W[id]C[One space too far...];B[kd]

Do not attack living groups!

So important, it's worth saying again:

;W[la];B[jb];W[ka];B[md];W[mc];B[ld]C[You were extremely lucky. White could have tenukied at any time, and you would have lost the initiative.

This is perhaps the right time in your Go development to memorize a new joseki which is more effective than the one you have played.

It only works with the black stone at c14 in place, but it  destroys white's top more effectively.

White has 4 stones against your two.

i find myself in such a situation quite often -- opponent manages to play in my-to-be-territory (w-L4) completely erasing it.

and i'm not quite sure what to do with this and what is the reason.


Saurus: 
Your mindset is completely wrong here. The thickness in the area is designed to close up territory elsewhere, not to make territory.

You could have made the same amount of secure territory in fuseki by playing 4 stones at q3, n3, k4 and g3. 
Instead, you have played 15 stones in the area, which would be highly ineficient to make the same amount of territory.

Surely, you want much more from these stones than a little territory.

If fact, it would have been better to pass than to play a stone at b-L4, because then you would have no way of closing up the rest of your territory if white did not invade there. You should be saying: "Thank you white for finally giving me the chance to turn my moyo into territory."

The way to achieve this goal is as follows:
- If you are 100% sure (and I mean 100%) that the bottom is too small for white to live, cap the white stone, and kill it.
- Normally, this is not the case. If you cannot see a clear kill, push the stone towards your thickness (wall) , and chase it with NON-CONTACT KNIGHTS MOVES. Chase white into the center, and close up everything around it.

[oa][na][ja]C[Summary of key area to improve:

There are four key areas that I noticed in this game that you need to improve on. Here are some do's and don'ts that you should focus on...

Don'ts:

1) Do not play moves which approach strong or living groups.
These will only strengthen your opponent, and give him a target to attack.

2) Do not use contact moves to attack or to try and kill.
After playing a contact move, your opponent will almost always be able to escape.

3) Remember in fuseki / early middle game that a tenuki is worth at least 20 points (and usually sente). Don't play a move that is worth less than this unless either the life or stability of your or your opponent's group depends on it.

4) Don't think of thickness as a means to make territory. Think of it as a way to secure the rest of your territory on the board by chasing your opponent. (See variation and comment on move 113)


Do's:

1) Chase your opponents WEAK groups, and profit from attacking them. Usually you can make more profit from chasing them than from killing them. Remember - killing should always be plan B.

2) Attack your opponent's weak groups with non-contact knight's moves.

3) Tenuki whenever the stability or life of your group, or your opponent's groups is not at stake. Use the rules of priority (at the beginning of this review) to guide your choice of tenuki.

4) Welcome opponents invasions which are near to your thickness. By chasing them, you will always increase your territory hugely on the rest of the board.

I hope you enjoyed the review and found it useful.
