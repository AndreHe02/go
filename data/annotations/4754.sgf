Hello, First of all thank you for your precious time. This is my first game which ive sent for review to GTL. Im playing with Black stones.

E: Hi, my name is Eric and I'll be doing your review];W[dd]
;B[df];W[qn];B[nq];W[fq];B[cn];W[nc];B[qf]C[My opponent said that its not good to response the same but this is a shape I know something about, so this is why Ive preferred.

E: I most people who start out usually like to stick to what they are familiar with and its not at all a bad idea, but you do learn alot more by trying out different openings and strategies. Besides you will never familiarize yourself with other openings if you dont play them.  Trying new openings will allow you to see what works and what doesn't as well as allow you to see how to counter some of them by watching how some opponents handle your moves.]

[fn][gn][hn][in][nn][on][fo][io][jo][ko][po][ep]C[E: early on black is in good position because of the handicap. Black has good influence towards the middle at the expense of the corners. At this point black should keep focused and concentrate on building its territory in the middle either. Notice the areas where white can invade and loosely build a wall. I've basically outined the places where white can attack the middle without risk of being cut. of course more aggressivce plays can be made but this is the basic idea.]

[go:A]C[E: Cutting at A would be quite advantageous. Playing E1 is really small. It's only a gain of  about 5 points, but you lose sente. Which at this point is far more that 5 points since there are alot of big moves that can be played.]
;B[es];W[ko];B[ln];W[kn];B[gj]C[E: This is a good move at this point.]

;W[hd];B[hf];W[mj]LB[hl:B][kl:A]C[E: I believe A or B would have been more threatening since the top group is safe.  This allows u to block J9 from connectiong or an attack on F5 group or the bottom corner all together.]

C[E: playing A or B could have safely cut off D7 and built more territory. C7 was overly defensive.]

My opponent made some mistakes but this is one of the best games I have played so this is why I choose to send. Hope its not much trouble to you.
I couldnt ask many questions but it is very hard for me to see whats going on sometimes, especially on 19x19 board.
Thank you again for your time. Fatih from Turkey.

E: Very well played end game. On a general note, as you make your moves, be consistent with the objective.  Like the proverb says "if you chase 2 hares, you will catch neither".  Also look at the board as a whole and try as hard as you can to see where the big points are and what is urgent.]
