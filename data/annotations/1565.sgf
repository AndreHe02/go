C[I am frustrated by this game.   He played small everywhere   and won. I could not kill him anywhere, nor build territory

attacking.   Perhaps I could improve by 2 points   in yose and won the game. But

it would be too small win.
arend: In the beginning of this game, B took more territory than W,
forcing W to take influence and weakening his own groups. However,
W missed several chances to launch a severe attack, mainly because
he was not aware enough of the weaknesses of B groups. So B (who  seems to have realized the weaknesses of his groups a little better)
got to play the crucial defensive moves;  he was leading
befor he made a mistake in the late middle game after which the game could have gone either way.  I hope you can get s.th. out of my comments -- feel free to
disagree with them and ask more questions.

Enjoy, Arend]

;W[ld];B[qc];W[rc];B[qb];W[lc]LB[qk:a][pk:b][qj:c][rb:d]C[arend: Since W20 is gote, it is more urgent to play on the right side (choose among a, b, c), Also, this way you can later choose to play
d (s18) instead of W 18. If you attack r12, B cannot spend a move for his top group so early in the game, so you will be able to choose among m17 and s18 according to later circumstances.]

I wanted him to force me make closing moves on the other side.

This was perhaps the major mistake.
arend: probably a (m18) is best.];B[lb];W[kb];B[mb];W[qn]LB[ql:a]
[pl:b][qk:c][pk:d][qj:e][pj:f]C[I had to close it with K17, but crawling along the first line seemed so small.  arend: i think right side is more urgent than k17 (although this is indeed huge): B got territory, you got influence, now its time to
reclaim your expenses by trying to get territory in the course
of the attack. However, i do not agree with the point you chose: B33
becomse an ideal move (both an extension from an unsettled group and a pince against W28); I am not strong enough to decide which move would be best, but it should definitely not allow a usual two-space extension from r11. So possible are a,b,c,d,e,f (r/q 8/9/10), of which I like  e and f best.]
;B[pf];W[of];B[qf];W[qe];B[qk]C[arend: very nice for B to play this move.]
;W[nq];B[qo]LB[oo:a]C[arend: I don't think the following moves are good for B (see somment after W 42). I would probably play a instead.]

LB[cf:a][ng:b]C[arend: I believe this is wrong direction. Locally, a (c14) seems to be better since for either side there is hardly any territory to gain at the top because of B k18 and its low position. On the other hand the r12 group is too weak to be left like this. Probably b (o13) is most useful to get some shape.]
;W[df];B[db];W[cc]LB[oi:a]C[arend: I would prefer to atack on the right, maybe starting with
a (p11).];B[cb];W[eq]C[arend: important point.];B[bc];W[bd]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[cm];W[cq]LB[oi:a]C[I wanted a small life here and a little bit territory
arend: Your comment seems to assume that you are weak. Very locally, this
seems to be true, but if you look at the whole board, there is
1. W influence on upper left, upper right, lower right
2. Weak black groups at j4 and (very weak!) around r12.
This should make clear that you have to initiate some attack. Having
said this, I have to admit I do not quite know where you should start your attack. Since I cannot find a very appealing move on lower left
(its hard to attack j4), I would tend to play a (p11).];B[bq]
;W[dp];B[cr]C[arend: better to play c5 -- now W is forced into an attacking position
against j4.];W[co];B[bp]C[arend: very unusual, i am unsure about this.]

(;W[fr]C[Connection does not seem reasonable.
arend: If you dont want to connect, than it is definitely better not to
play ko -- compare result after W76 with the result of the variation
given at W70 -- the extra black stone at d1 is quite a difference!  On the other hand, the position after W connects seems reasonable for W to me (see Var).]
;B[dq];W[fp];B[gq];W[fq];B[in]C[Awfull position. Black has 4 corners and white does not seem to have much advantage in the center.  arend: yes W does -- B still has two weak groups.]

C[arend: better to play more aggressive as in previous variation. Also
a (m9) looks dangerous for B.];B[lk];W[ci]LB[li:a]C[arend: still possible to fight on the right, i would play a (m11).]

arend: yes.];W[ms];B[ks];W[es];B[dr];W[ja];B[la];W[ba]C[Seems the biggest.
arend: True. W has gained due to B's mistake at j17 and a little
more precise endgame.
W has appr. 18 (left side) + 14 (top group) + 7 (LR) + 9 (right side)   Komi = 53.5
B has appr. 8(UR) + 4(LR) + 4(R) + 15(Center) + 6(Lower Side) + 14(LL)

So its not yet decided.

you do not seem to take into account follow-up moves correctly. I will
give a few examples (no comments apart from that beyond this point).]
