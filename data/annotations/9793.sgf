C[Hello, Schmidtch!

I am a European amateur 2d, calling myself HonFu in the GTL.

I am supposed to look at this game from Black's perspective. Since you have left no remarks or questions, I have the freedom to choose a "topic", if possible. White played rather actively in the opening, and Black constantly had to choose, what to do about it.

Whenever your opponent plays a strong move, one that feels like it might even be an overplay, you have to think about if you can "punish" him, and how. Unfortunately this is not at all easy, because in order to punish, sometimes you have to react decisively, and sometimes the best punishment is to just play along and let the opponent do just what he wants (because the result is not really good for him). But how can we tell one case from the other? Many games have been lost because one player tried too hard to punish a move, and many other games went down the drain because one player just let his opponent have his way too much.

So in order to get some more insight in the matter (while of course also looking at a lot of the usual stuff) let us look at this game circling around the question: "Resist or indulge?" 

Alright, let's go!];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp]
(;W[op]C[*Hon* White doesn't play in the empty corner first, which is normally considered biggest. So what is the meaning of White's early approach here? 

It is usually played to prevent Black from playing a standard opening. If Black plays passively, it can also help White to get the initiative in the game.

So, resist or indulge? In this case, it is not so easy to decide, so there are a lot of variations.]

(;B[oq]C[*Hon* This is the most passive response; it is what White is hoping for, which doesn't mean that it is necessarily bad.]
;W[nq];B[pq]C[*Hon* At this point, White normally tenukis and plays in the empty corner.]

(;W[np]C[*Hon* White does not choose the tenuki course, but just continues with the joseki.]

(;B[pn]
(;W[jp]C[*Hon* Okay, White did not play as I suggested, but connected and played the joseki. Now we have the strange situation that White chose to play a side joseki before playing in an empty corner - which is supposed to be bad, right?

Black obviously wants to go into the lower left corner now, but we have to consider how to best counter White's plans. White has played a high extension. This means, that he still wants to develop the lower side.

This gives us a hint about how we might try to spoil something that he wants, to resist his plans in a profitable way, and "prove" that he should have gone into the lower left corner first.]

(;B[dp]C[*Hon* I will not say that this move is impossible, but it seems to help White giving his lower side group meaning. So I added some ideas about how you could try to resist White's plan.]

(;W[cn]C[*Hon* From what I say in the variations, you probably see that I don't agree with this move.]
;B[fq]C[*Hon* Black can play a move that prevents further development of the high-standing group on the lower side.]
;W[hq]LB[fq:A]C[*Hon* Now suddenly White plays on the side anyway! 

I think this is contradictory. If White wanted to play here, he should have just taken A himself.]
;B[bp]LB[jq:A]TR[cn]C[*Hon* This is a good moment to be indulgent! 

Black's group is getting safe and is also undermining the marked stone. The formation on the lower side looks inefficient: White would probably prefer to have just one stone at A and the other stone somewhere else on the board.]
;W[ep]LB[eo:A]C[*Hon* This again looks strange, White pressing randomly on top of black.

Maybe one can think about resisting with a move like A ...]
;B[eq]C[*Hon* ... but since White is now very strong at the bottom, just defending is probably wisest.]

(;W[eo]C[*Hon* I think, this is a moment for Black, where he can think about resisting, about being strict. But it is not so easy ...]

(;B[de]LB[do:A]C[*Hon* Let's talk about this move and its alternatives.

Black has decided not to push at A. Since A is sente for White, Black has to assume that White will play there.]

(;W[dh];B[gd];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[dd];W[ec];B[cc];W[cb]C[*Hon* This is regarded as an overplay, when the ladder is bad. For details, please look at www.josekipedia.com, there are a lot of variations. This is a joseki I have myself messed up quite a few times. :-)]
;B[ed];W[fd];B[fc]C[*Hon* This is one of the moments where Black needs to be strict and actually find the punishment. And so he does.]
;W[bc]C[*Hon* White makes it a bit easy, though ...];B[ff]TR[dh]
C[*Hon* ... just letting his outside stones get laddered. 

This is terrible for White. Black gets super strong in the center, and if that's happening, White can hardly hope to get a lot of points there. Also the marked stone becomes a target.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[on]
(;B[ge]
(;W[qn]C[*Hon* This must be an overplay. Black is alive in the corner, and White is cutting from the inside without an aim in sight.]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[pl];W[ql]C[*Hon* Here Black is again at a point where he has to decide if he wants to be strict or soft.]

(;B[qk]TR[pl][pm][pn]C[*Hon* Here Black plays a decisive move. But in this case, Black's marked stones have only three liberties. 

In the fight of the real game, Black comes out advantageous, so if he has figured this all out, we can see the hane as a way to strong-arm his opponent into resignation. 

But we have all been in situations where we had a good position, got overly confident, agreed to "dance" with our opponent, when he tried to mix it up - and then still lost the game in the resulting confusion.

When we are clearly ahead, we have to decide if we choose the strict or the indulgent course. The natural thing is to take the safest road to victory. Creating confusion might just help the opponent to turn tables.]

(;W[pk];B[ol]
(;W[ok];B[nl]TR[qk]C[*Hon* Good for Black is that White can not capture the marked stone.]
;W[rk]C[*Hon* White is forced to push from the 2nd line anyway.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[qi];W[ri];B[qh];W[nk];B[ml];W[rh]TR[ml][nl][ol]
[pl][pm][pn]C[*Hon* This fight is probably good for Black, but anyway, his marked stones are without a base. Just extending instead of the hane would have been easier to control.]

(;B[lj]LB[qg:A]C[*Hon* Leaving the Hane A for White to play is annoying. I don't want to say that this is bad for Black (he is leading after all), but if possible, Black wants to sail home safely without opportunities for White to mix it up.]

(;W[oi];B[qg]
(;W[og]
(;B[oe]C[*Hon* This move just seems to push White to the outside, towards your baseless group.]
;W[mh];B[kl]C[*Hon* You defended your weak spot, which is good.]
;W[kh];B[ij];W[ih]
(;B[gh]LB[oe:A]C[*Hon* Here Black is playing from his strong stones, leading White towards his weak stones, in a way the same mistake as A. 

We should always try to play from our weak stones, so that they become stronger, and drive the opponent's weak stones towards our strength!]
;W[hi]C[*Hon* Now White splits Black, so Black has helped his opponent to attack him.]

(;B[hj]C[*Hon* Then Black plays from the other side again ...]
;W[gi]TR[hi]C[*Hon* ... hurting the stone he has just played. That is not good!

Black had a chance to play at the marked spot himself, strengthening himself, being in front of White and surrounding him; now White is in front and has split Black in two!]
;B[gj];W[fi]LB[fh:A][fj:B]C[*Hon* This White's move is a good example for an indulgent move which is punishment enough!

Many players have the urge to play a hane, whenever they see it; but A or B would just give Black a cutting point to work with. Just walking out, splitting Black nicely in two, is good enough.]
;B[lo];W[lp];B[ko];W[kp];B[rg]
(;W[rn];B[ro];W[sn];B[cl]C[*Hon* This maybe is a bit risky.]

(;W[co];B[cp];W[em]C[*Hon* So White was able to repair his shape!]
;B[ek];W[fj];B[fk];W[gl];B[gk];W[il]C[*Hon* Oookay ... ambitious!]
;B[jl];W[ik];B[im];W[hl];B[jk];W[ho];B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[ji]
;B[jj];W[kd]C[*Hon* Risky: White's top left is not alive yet.]
;B[mc];W[nd];B[nc];W[md];B[lc];W[ld]
(;B[db]C[*Hon* Wrong side!];W[eb];B[bb];W[da]C[*Hon* By cutting on the wrong side first ...]
;B[ac];W[fb];B[gb];W[ba];B[ad];W[fa]C[*Hon* ... you gave White a way to survive.]
;B[li];W[lh]
(;B[ci];W[dj]C[*Hon* Yeah, how to answer here ...];B[ej];W[di]
;B[ei];W[dk];B[dl];W[el];B[bl];W[ch];B[bi];W[bh]

;B[pf];W[id];B[hd];W[if];B[sh];W[sl];B[cf];W[bg];B[hh];W[ii]
LB[db:A][jc:B][di:D][qk:C][an:E]C[*Hon* Black would have won this game if he had not lost on time, although White survived in the upper left and successfully invaded in the upper right. The vague potential in the center, as was to be expected, went down to almost nothing, after White had messed up so terribly in the upper left.

Let's summarize Black's biggest mistakes:
A should have died
B was useless and should have been used to prevent an invasion of the upper right
C was unnecessarily fierce and in another situation could have meant trouble. All the fighting in the center wouldn't have happened without the hane. When just extending is clearly good for you, you don't have to hane and give your opponent a cut to work with.
D could have died - at least if 
E had been in the right spot. :-)

So, I hope by circling around the topic of "resist or indulge", I hope I was able to give you some useful ideas to work with in the future. 

Good luck with your go!])

White would have to play A, then defend with a move around B. Your group looks like it can never be killed, and White's center potential is completely gone now.

Take a look at your marked stones. They are so strong, that they are not threatened by White's huge wall. Even if White gets a move around C, I don't see any danger for Black. So by using your strong group as a "cliff at which enemy ships may shatter", you use it in the most efficient way.]

;W[qk];B[pj];W[qi];B[oh]TR[pd][ge]C[*Hon* If Black just goes on like this, he will have no trouble at all. He is automatically nullifying any chances for White to profit in the center, and at the same time also creating a large influence zone at the top. 

By not resisting and just following White's flow, the game stays just what it was before White's cut: Good for Black.

))
(;B[pm]C[*Hon* Black can even answer once, the ladder is still good for him.]
))
(;W[do]C[*Hon* If White plays here now, Black can hardly ignore it, right? 

But if Black answers, suddenly White's stones are well connected. Black may have lost an opportunity to cut, but on the other hand, he gets solid in the corner and has not compromised his own shape.

Anyway, while approaching the upper left corner, Black has to assume, that White plays this move, because it's sente and may help him on the left side.]
;B[cp]C[*Hon* Anyway, now Black has to answer.];W[dg]C[*Hon* And White can then play a pincer which helps him put some value to his stones in the lower left.

Now our judgement about if the corner approach was good or not would depend on how we evaluate the left side for White. 

On the one hand, White has influence stones in the lower left, so in a way the pincer seems to work well with it.]
;B[cl]LB[cf:B][bn:A]TR[de]C[*Hon* On the other hand, the wall is not really closed off, so Black might still invade here later, threatening to connect with A, which would make it kind of pointless for White to building a moyo here in the first place.

So what is your feeling? If you estimate this invasion aji as annoying for White, your approach looks good. But if you think, the invasion will be rather hard to aim for, then you might to prefer treating the left side as White's influence zone. Then, instead of the marked stone, an approach at B would be more appropriate.]

(;B[do]C[*Hon* If Black pushes just once, he seems to create a weakness. This would be my first impulse.]
;W[dn]LB[en:A][co:1][cp:2][dq:3]TR[do][dp]C[*Hon* Now there's a cutting point at A. If Black should cut directly is another question.

There's a downside, though: Black's two stones only have three liberties. So, is there something for White to do?]
;B[tt];W[dq]C[*Hon* Cutting would be the most obvious way.]

(;B[bo]C[*Hon* If Black makes a Bamboo ...];W[cq]C[*Hon* ... he is getting into a kind of semeai. Even if he wins it, White will get strengthening moves on the outside. Black doesn't want that.]

(;B[bo]C[*Hon* Or if he plays here ...];W[gp]C[*Hon* ... maybe it is enough to just play here ...]
;B[en];W[dl];B[fp]C[*Hon* ... because now Black can probably not hope to push here anymore ...]
;W[fo]LB[do:B][er:A]C[*Hon* ... since in the end he will have to return to A.

It is not all that easy - resist or indulge? By pushing at B, Black has reduced his own liberties and thereby in a way helped White with his defence.

I am too weak to really judge it ... but let's say that Black doesn't push. Either he gets to push later, or White prevents it, but strengthens Black a lot. Seems like both is okay for Black, so maybe I'd - now after some deliberation - also just leave it, as you did.]

(;W[jq]C[*Hon* If White played here, this would give us a totally different hint! 

Now the group sits flat and solid on the 3rd line. It does not want or need to develop anymore, it is closed off. So in this situation we would choose a move in the corner, that puts more emphasis on the left side.

This is another reason why normally we play in the corners first, and then at the edges: A stone you put there is still more flexible in his development, so you can choose a fitting course of play for the sides at a later point. If you play a side joseki like this first, you have to make a decision, and then the opponent not only gets the more valuable empty corner, but also can choose the perfect point, relating well to the settled situation on the side.]

(;B[po]C[*Hon* I think this is the more usual move if you want to develop the right side.]
)
(;B[qn]C[*Hon* Most people nowadays would just play here.]))
(;W[dp]C[*Hon* Like this, White gets two corners, but he has also prevented a shimari or a mini chinese opening.

From what I read in go books, professionals seem to dislike this for Black, because White got what he wanted (forced Black to a passive answer in the lower right), then took the empty corner anyway. Also White now is in three places of the board, he developed more "wholeboardily" than Black.

But from my perspective, if this is an advantage, it should be one of the very subtle kind that is very hard to exploit for an amateur player.]

(;B[np]C[*Hon* After all, Black can cut here now, since White has refused to play the usual joseki.]

(;W[mq]C[*Hon* Then White still has the option to extend and make a group at the bottom, so this is not all bad for him.]
;B[no];W[jq]C[*Hon* Actually it is even in the joseki books. At first glance, White seems to be worse off, but we must not forget, that Black has spent one more move in this corner, so naturally he locally has a better result. White got a move in another place as a compensation.]
;B[pj]TR[op]C[*Hon* In this situation, Black's developing influence (the marked white stone may have some potential, but it can hardly run away) works well on the right side, so this would not be the course of action I'd choose.

On the other hand, Black, since he plays first in every game, will always have a moyo, if he wants, no matter how White plays, so in order to find out if this is good or bad, let's try to compare this with another standard opening: The three stars formation.]
;AB[pp]AE[no][np][op][qp][jq][mq][nq][oq][pq];W[nq]C[*Hon* Normally White approaches from the outside in order to prevent further growth.]
;B[lq]C[*Hon* Black wants to confine White in the corner to increase his formation.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]LB[nc:B][jd:A]C[*Hon* Black just built up a wall towards the right side, which looks quite nice, but White got the corner as a compensation, and he also has sente, so that next he can choose a move like A, to prevent further growth of the formation, or B, which would give Black even another wall, but enough compensation to still have a good game.

If we compare it with the other position, Black's formation on the right looks ... well, just about the same, a three star formation with a wall. But Black also got the corner there!

On the other hand, White got the lower side in the other variation, while here Black has started to build up there. So maybe it is just a matter of taste after all.

Anyway, let us look a few moves further into the sanrensei opening, because it fits nicely to our topic.]
;W[nc]C[*Hon* If White approached now, it would continue as follows.]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me]C[*Hon* Black got a seemingly perfect formation. Which is kind of strange, isn't it? First White enters the lower right corner, just to give Black a perfect wall, then, even after he saw the result, he does exactly the same in the upper right.

In a way this may look as if he is indulging too much, that he is just helping his opponent to get what he wants.

But ...];W[kj]C[*Hon* ... ironically this works for White anyway! 

Black has just built his second wall, but in gote, so this is the signal for White to reduce the large moyo.]
;B[mj]TR[dc][kj][dp]C[*Hon* Let's assume Black just closes off his right side territory. At first glance this may look quite large, and one might wonder, how White could allow anything like this to happen. But experience shows, that White can very well play like this!

To find out the reason, we have to take a look at what White got, as well! The two corners add up to about 20 points. For the both stones in the upper left and lower left we can each estimate as about 5 points. Also White has komi, you must never forget that when estimating the score! So White up to now has 36,5 points of territory and it looks like he's behind by over twenty points.

But we must not forget that White's stones on the left can still develop! This is White's side of the board: When Black does something there, White will have the local advantage and his territories will grow. Also, it is White's turn to play, and he can try to choose a course that makes his three stones correspond. Usually White can at least get an even game, more likely an advantageous one, if Black just defends like this. 

By strictly developing his own moyo up to this point, forcing White to do what he wants, Black seems to have controlled the flow of the game. But now, that the forcing is over, the situation has kind of turned around: From this point on, it will rather be White deciding the course of the game.

So instead of N10, normally Black has to play something a little more active, like going for an attack of the center stone. But White has not entered too deeply, so it is not easy to get a really good attack. And in the process of fighting, White might run deeper into the right side. Black will not attack too directly, but rather play actively while trying to compromise the white center stone. That seems to lead to a roughly even game, but if I remember correctly, professionals seem to play the three stars rather rarely nowadays, since other openings statistically get better results for Black.

So in the three stars opening we find a good example for viable indulging: White does what the opponent wants and gets a good game anyway! (Here the underlying principle is that Black has only one formation on the board, which makes him unflexible; if he is forced to keep these points, White can play a lot of sente moves in the endgame. So usually a game, where you have many positions across the board, is easier to play, because it is more flexible. By "indulging" Black's moyo strategy, White forces him to put all his money on one big formation - which can be disadvantageus. That's why this strategy works.)

But now let's get back to the actual game.])
(;W[qj]C[*Hon* But White also has the option to just play somewhere else again.]
;B[mq]C[*Hon* But isn't it strange, to approach the lower right, then just let every stone die?

Even if this may seem so, we must not be too quick to judge here!]
;AB[dc][ce][qm][cn][dp][eq]AE[qj][np][op][mq][nq][pq]C[*Hon* To understand this better, let us talk a bit about the methods for estimating a position. 

Early in the game it is hard to predict, how many points you will have, but to at least get a hint, you have to be able to do some kind of estimation, right?

One way is to look at a single stone in a corner, like the hoshi stone in the upper right, as "having" territory of about 5 points, no matter where it sits or what happens next. Why 5? Well, zero points would be wrong, otherwise it would make no sense playing a stone there at all, so there must be some value in it, right? If we now look at a few typical situations that MIGHT happen later in the game, we can get our hint.

In the upper left there is one typical shimari. It costs two moves and gets about ten points, maybe a bit more. So every stone must by average be worth something about five, right? In the lower left, there is a shimari from a hoshi stone. To close territory around a hoshi, you need three stones. 17 points for three moves, so every move must again have the value of something about 5 points. In the lower right, Black has extended from a shimari to make an indestructible territory. How much is it worth? Again the count would be about 17 points with three moves spent. 

So this is where we get our 5 points for a single stone in a corner!]
;AW[dc][qj][dp][op][nq]AB[np][mq][pq]AE[ce][qm][cn][eq]C[*Hon* Now back to our position. If we look at the result in the lower right, White's two stones virtually died. For what kind of profit? Let us say, it is something about 17 points. The two White stones cancel out against two of Black's stones. So Black has actually played three stones in this corner (while White did something else) and has got about 17 points to show for it. 

So if we look just at the profit, this is actually not so different to just making a territory with three moves! 

I am not saying that you should throw away your stones like this all the time, because you also make the opponent stronger and lose opportunities to do something different in this area. But normally, when our stones die like that, we feel like "oh no, I am losing", right? But if we really take a close look at how many points were made for how many gote moves, we often see that the profit was not so big after all. Black has not achieved unduly much. Which is the reason why sacrifices like this are possible in the first place.]

(;AW[cn]AB[fq][kq]AE[op][nq][oq][pq]C[*Hon* Compare this for example with this situation, where instead of White, Black is developing in more areas of the board.]
)))
(;B[dp]C[*Hon* This is the first point where Black can resist. White has chosen not to play first in an empty corner - so Black takes the opportunity to get there himself. 

This is like: "Oh, you refuse the biggest place, the empty corner? Well, then I take it."]
;W[pn]TR[op]C[*Hon* But White can then take the initiative in the other corner, where Black did not answer, making it look like he played there first, on the marked spot, and Black invaded at the 3-4-point. In other words: White has taken an empty corner after all, only the move order is different.

It is hard to say that Black has punished anything. It's definitely not a standard opening, so in a way you could say, that White has got what he wanted; on the other hand, if it's not a favourable, but just a normal, even position for White, then Black does not need to be unhappy about it.]
)
(;B[mq]C[*Hon* Another attempt would be to involve White in a fight directly, and then find a way to come out in sente to play in the lower right. 

Or White eventually gets the lower left, but has to accept Black's predominance in the lower right. Both would be okay for Black.

I have seen one game between Japanese top professionals, where White approached with his second move, Black played a pincer, and then an intense fight started, where both sides could not leave to take the empty corner. If I remember correctly, White finally got to play the biggest move on the board - the empty corner - but it was already move 75, far beyond the opening!

So playing a pincer here means that Black wants to engage in fighting directly, so that White has no time to play the empty corner.]
))
(;W[dp]C[*Hon* Normally White would take an empty corner. From this point, Black has the choice between several standards openings.]

(;B[oq]C[*Hon* For example going on like this, making the right side very large ...]
)
(;B[fq];W[cn];B[kq]C[*Hon* ... or like this, the popular "mini chinese" opening, building up an influence zone at the bottom.]
