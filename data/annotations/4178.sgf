C[fintiger: I have made a comment on some most mind-troubling points, but naturally I would like to know any ways to improve my gameplay or if I made big mistakes along the play.

krv: Thank you for opportunity to observe your game. I have commented it and give some playstile comments at the end.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[nq]C[fintiger: I often like to play this move as black but I'm not actually sure if it's good in large scale so early?

krv: I don't play like this, but I think that this move is ok.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]
(;B[qc]C[fintiger: R17 necessary or not? I wanted to play somewhere on top first to prevent the opponent's next move but then decided I'd hold onto the corner and go for other places later.]
;W[kc];B[gd]LB[fq:a][ip:b][cj:c][dj:d][pk:e][cn:f][cf:g]C[fintiger: I had some trouble positioning this one, but considering I find myself rather weak in tsumego I wanted to leave a clear way for escape to the center.

krv: I think now it's too early to invade here. I like moves a-g (a - more, g - less]
;W[qk];B[qm];W[qh]
(;B[ec]C[krv: Better P13.
And if you aren't strong in tsumego you shouldn't leave weak groups for a long.]
;W[dc];B[eb];W[jq]
(;B[cn]C[krv: I like C14 here.];W[dk]
(;B[en]C[fintiger: Playing when pincered and whenever in lack of space around has always been a bit of a problem to me. How can I make this result better?

krv: Usual way is C3];W[fp];B[bk];W[ck];B[cl]C[krv: B8 better. If then played B10 you can don't answer.]
;W[bj];B[bl];W[dl];B[dm];W[gf];B[cg]C[fintiger: This is about the last chance to play inside right? What are the choices here?

krv: Do you mean left? You have two weak groups and one group to attack. P13 is still urgent and you need to play around J17]
;W[ce];B[bi];W[aj]
(;B[ci];W[cj];B[ef];W[dg];B[dh];W[eg];B[df];W[no]C[fintiger: I was surprised he didn't cut me off at C14 and so I got the result I wanted - to connect my groups. What is he aiming at with O5?

krv: I don't know. May be he think about the ladder?];B[cf]
;W[fg]
(;B[fe];W[db]
(;B[hp]C[fintiger: I'm extremely bad at reducing their moyo. How to do it for W's bottom left?

krv: For 12k we can consider this game as even.You should not play so agressive.]

C[fintiger: This is where djones resigned. It was a rather fast paced dogfight. I prefer solid territory building contests but unfortunately it's not always up to me...

krv: 
You should protect your own weakness before attacking.
And your shapes aren't always good.
If you fix two main problems you can play several stones stronger.]
