AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hello.   I often feel very confused in these high handicap games.   I went though and made moves that I think would have been better moves for me.   I think my direction of play is lacking somewhat and my stones don't work together well.

Thank you for your time!


Hi there.

My name is Ilan Keshet, i am 4k on kgs.

I am sorry for not sending in the review earlier. I hope you learn something from the review. Feel free to send an email back to me.]
