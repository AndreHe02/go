C[AxelE: Hi and thanks for reviewing this game. I played black, and think I could have won was it not for some mistakes in dealing with the late invasion, but would also like some feedback on how I played in the mid-game, creating and defending center territory, and if I could use thickness - which, I noted, I tend to form quite often - in a more effective way.]

(;B[kq]C[AxelE: I have been playing this style of opening recently, following up two lone corner stones with one placed between my opponent's, so I don't have to play against a sanren-sei or double wing formation. Is there anything I should keep in mind when playing like this, or some implications of this play that I am not following up in a good manner? The two-space jump and one point extension following after this, for instance?]
;W[mq];B[hq];W[fq];B[ho]C[I'd recommend tenuki. You do not need to live on the side. At this point running to the center is not a problem.]
;W[dm];B[cf]C[This is a thank you move as white may now close his position on the 3rd line.]

;W[db];B[fd];W[eb];B[ed];W[gc];B[gd]C[AxelE: Unnecesasary on my part?

No, I think it is good. If W tenuki B h17 is way to strong for B. So g16 should be sente and there for be ok.]
;W[hc];B[jd]C[I'd hane, why jump? In this position you get pushed from behind, no need to create weaknesses.]
;W[ic];B[qi]C[AxelE: Or should I, as early as at this point, have tried to use the thickness at the top to enter at, say, C9?

I think the right side is the important one at this stage of the game. W will not answer r11 with e11 as the moves on the right side are bigger right now.
Even though I'd go a bit further, like r6 or at least r9.];W[qm]
;B[qq]C[AxelE: This corner invasion I was pretty unsure about. It worked out eventually, and I thought I saw a "path" quite early on, but I still have the feeling that I could have done better or achieved the same result with simpler means. Or maybe I couldn't have hoped for more after invading a corner where W already had that many stones?

The invasion is ok and should result in a KO.];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo]

;B[ri];W[qj];B[oi]C[why not hane or extend?];W[pj];B[dh];W[ch]
;B[dg];W[pi];B[ph];W[oj];B[ni];W[nj];B[lp]C[AxelE: Tried to reduce W's moyo and expand my own... would there have been a point in trying to jump straight in with something near O7, or would that have got me nowhere?

There is no need for o7 at this point. The moyo is not that big. If you go too deep, white will attack from the lower side and get some strenght and will at some point attack the weak stones at the bottom side.]
;W[mp];B[lo];W[mo];B[lm]C[Again: Why jump? 
Getting pushed from behind is in general really beneficial.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[ln];B[kn];W[lq];B[jm]C[AxelE: Protected the top, but realized afterwards that maybe I should have protected L4 - or was that necessary? I was happy to get ro return there in a few moves, but maybe this was actually just a wasted move?

You created weaknesses by jumping without getting a really good advantage out of it. If you play a bit more calm and let your opponent push you there won't be that many weaknesses. Just look at the cutting points at p12, r12, l4. The benefit you got by jumping were not worth the weaknesses. One other big thing is n11. The position should have gotten one players attention by now. If w hanes it is (for a good part because of the weaknesses created by jumping) really painful for b.
To answer the direct question: The move was not a waste, but the weakness you have to deal with was so big that it could not even be handled with one move.]
;W[di]C[AxelE: Before this move, would it have been possible to attack these two white stones? If so, where? Near D9?


d9 was possible but got a bit less interresting after the exchange of d12-c12. Still a fight would have been favourable for B cause of the strong wall.]
;B[ei];W[ej];B[fi];W[fj];B[kr]C[This situation happend a few times in the game where a position like this is left alone (compare o11). There is a proverb "always hit on the head of two stones" which W should have follwed here. If B just extends (pushing from behind) it would be much better as B's territory becomes solid while W does not really get anything.]
;W[lr]C[Lucky for B w plays a really small move. W should play g11 or n11 (our you should have instead of l2 cause it is quite small.]
;B[li];W[qd];B[qc]C[AxelE: Here, too, I was unsure of what tactic to apply. Protected the corner and pushed toward my T11 stones, but in retrospect I am thinking these might have been too far away and had too many weak points. Still satsified with the result - the wall toward the center - but I think maybe I was let off easily, and maybe I could have read further.]
;W[qh]C[I'd sacrefice the 2 stones and be happy that w gave me the chance to fix my weakness and kill the corner invasion so easyly.]

;W[gm];B[hn]C[AxelE: 127 should of course have been at H7, but in this situation - G8 would have been preferable, right?

The stones on the low side can still be attacked, so strenghening them is good even though losing 5 stones hurts.]
