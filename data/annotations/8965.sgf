C[So the upshot of your invasion at move 26 (which was premature, but nicely handled) is that you have changed White's assets from a small territory to thickness of about the same value, whilst reducing your territory in the bottom left by roughly the territory  you gained around B8.

         2  So you scored about zero in gote: compare that to a definite large gain at Q5 or O17; ... or a pass!]

(;B[he];W[id]LB[id:2][he:1]C[When you are split like this, White has one goup to take care of, and you need to play on EACH side for every move that he does.  I.e. you cannot, and a group on one side or other of the white stones has to take a loss.

This move is too thin ("Don't play close to thickness").  Q5, securing territory would be good.  This move asks White to fight, and he has massive thickness to sqash your stones up against.  White will not make much territory around here since he is open to the H15 group.

[cs:I][es:K][fs:L]TR[oi][lj][oj][kk][lk]C[At the end you say you thought you were ahead.  Let's have a quick estimate here.  Assume the sente reductions in territory - a monkey jump in the bottom right, and a push at C1, shown with letters A - P to get a rough idea.

Then count the points IN PAIRS.  (Some people then double to get the number of points; I prefer the alternative which is simply to compair the pairs of points for each side.  I find the smaller numbers easier to remember, and avoid the time and effort of doubling).  So the numbers represent the point marked AND a point next to it.  (So 1 - 6 means the point marked plus the point below it).

You don't count what is yet to be disputed, like e.g. White may play L2, B K2, W M2.  And we don't know whether White will get to rescue D14, so don't count those for either side.

I get to 15 for Black, as shown, plus another pair at R18 and C10 (which did not have convenient partners locally).  So 16 pairs to Black (or 32 points).  (Yes, you may get D14, and E1, but for a rough estimate, just count what you are sure of getting).  Notice that you count captured stones as a pair (the stone plus the point  it covers.).  So if you start to count White's territory in the centre, starting with the captured stones, you can see immediately that there are 5 captured stones there - 5 PAIRS;  then the rest of that central territory comes to about the same as your score.  So W is ahead by his other bits and pieces (perhaps about 9 pairs, or 18, but you don't even need to count them).  This is close to the final score of 16.5

The earlier and more often you count, the better.  Counting is ESSENTIAL for strategic decisions, so make it quick and easy by just counting pairs.]

Last comment.

Take away lessons: don't play near thickness; don't make weak groups, unless it gives your opponent one; count early.  At the beginning, think of making your territory bigger before thinking of spoiling your opponent's territory (I'm thinking of moves 8 and 26).  You have to allow him some territory: just make sure yours is bigger!

Look at the final result for stones that I said were too close to thickness:
M9 (132) - captured;
H5 (150) - captured;
R10 and S13 - surrounded: 2 points of territory in exchange for that White wall around it.
K11 - you had to spend a move rescuing it (172).];B[fh];W[if]
