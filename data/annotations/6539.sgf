(;B[fl]MA[jd]C[I don't know why I didn't play E8 here. A one-space leap here is better than keima here, right?

>I prefer your move it to E8 (see 2 variations) but the best is to play around K16 to build influence on the top, especially utilizing black's handicap stones]
;W[ck];B[ej]MA[jd][pj][jp]C[Further capping. I'm terrible at keeping stones out of my territory, so these caps are basically necessary for me to get anything done.

>See previous comment.  Black should play at (possibly near) K16 or one of the other X marks to build influence and take best advantage of handicap stones.  If you do that, you can afford to let white make some territory on the left because you will be making a lot more.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[dh];B[eg]MA[jd][pj][jp]C[This seems like a good move. Is it?

>I don't think so.  From the whole-board point of view, playing on one of the X's is more important.  Also, it leaves a cutting point for white]
;W[gp]MA[fc]C[>This is a blunder for white.  White is better at F17.  If white is determined to play around G4, a lower move at G3 would be better.]

(;B[hn]MA[eh]C[>I don't understand this.  First, it develops toward the center, where it is harder to make territory than along a side.  Second, it does not adequately strengthen black because white can play the cut at X.  

See variation, which sketches out one reasonable continuation.]

[aa][ce][be][ae]C[Here I ignored his stone to further develop my influence on the left side. Is that important, or should I have gone after that stone? (In retrospect, I should have just played F15, acheiving both goals.)

>Frankly not a good move, because it doesn't accomplish anything. The marked black stones are not in immediate danger so this extension doesn't help them.  What's more at stake are the roughly 20 points in the corner.  If black replies differently (variation), he can secure them.]
;W[nc];B[ne]MA[jd]C[>Sorry, I don't like this move.  I would play at X, dividing white.  White has 2 responses, to defend somewhere around X, in which case you can play at P17 and take the corner, or to play around R17 and make a small corner territory (possibly pushing down along the right as well), in which case you can secure the top.  Either way is good for black.

There is another problem with your move as played, and that is it is too high (farther from the edge than white's attacking stone).  This lets white build territory underneath too easily. In exchange, black of course can push into the center.  But it takes a lot more stones to make territory in the center than along the sides so that is not necessarily productive.

If you skip ahead to the end position you can see that is basically what happened and it did not help black!!!]

[ic][hc][gc]C[>Now you see why it was important for black to have played around K16 earlier.

Another thing: although your capping move at 18 looked reasonable from a local point of view, it mainly provoked white's takeover of the top, almost 30 points, and still leaves you open on the right side where white invades next.]
;W[pg]CR[gp]MA[jq][iq]C[>If I were white I wouldn't do this quite yet.  I'd take sente by playing at either X and, after black responded, maybe then invade on the right.  

23 as played is not optimum for white.  It would be more dangerous if played around Q10, for example.  By playing now at J3 black can probably kill white's marked stone.]
;B[ng];W[oi]C[>White can still  play around J3 effectively.]

(;B[ni]C[>If black is determined to play locally, it is probably better to play low rather than cap.  That way, you can get some of the side territory and force white into the center where it is harder to live.  See variation]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[ol];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml]C[I recognized that if I played at N7, he could have just cut them and gained more territory.

;W[ln]
(;B[km]CR[pp]MA[pm]C[Capping with the keima here seemed like my best option, since I was in a position to attack a stone at L8 if he tried to cut it.

>Yes.  But again, look at what white has done, which threatens to enlarge his group and/or extend it toward his isolated stone at G3.  Meanwhile, the black stone at Q3 may need protection. I think a peeping move at X, forcing white to connect, is possibly worthwhile for black.  See variation.]

LB[nq:Y]MA[qn]C[Hoping to develop territory down here.

>That's the right thinking, but X is lighter and faster.  You might also consider the symmetrically opposed move Y.  White would next play around K4 to connect eventually with the isolated marked stone and make some territory on the bottom.  Depending on what white does next, you could either extend farther to the left (around M3) or do something on the right side like X or the previously mentioned peep at Q7.]
