C[Hello, and thanks for submitting the game!  I hope my comments will help you to improve.  Before I get into the game I want to mention that the best way to improve is to do "tsumego," or Go problems.  It's best to find a set of probelms and run through them fairly quicky and repetitively until you learn the shapes by heart.  This is true all the way from beginner to the highest levels of play.  That is probably more important than any advice in the rest of the review.  But I hope that that advice is good too!]
;B[pc]C[ximena [17k\]: hi];W[pq]C[Zehn [18k\]: hi];B[ce];W[cp]

(;B[ec]C[This is an unconventional move, and I think it's a poor one for a few reasons.  First, this corner enclosure is sort of a trick play.  It's best to avoid those, because it doesn't make you stronger to use tricks rather than using solid play.  The standard corner enclosures (or "shimari") are better to play.  If you're not familiar with those go to senseis.xmp.net (this is an excellent Go resource) and look up "shimari."  See the variation for how W should play here locally.]

(;W[iq];B[qj]C[Logical.];W[qe]
(;B[qd]C[This is fine.  You can also consider a variation I've shown.  It leads to a complicated position, but it's worth considering.]
;W[re]C[A clear mistake by white.];B[ph]CR[pc][qd][qe]SQ[pe]
C[This is not the most punishing response; Q15 is correct.  Whenever you can make a tiger's mouth shape on top of your opponent's stones it is something you must consider.  In this case W cannot make a base for his stones, so his only way out is to run to the middle.  Q12 (your move) is good because it restricts W's running space.  However, Q15 is better!  It leaves B with a strong shape and W with few options.]
;W[rh];B[pg]SQ[pe]C[No good.  Your idea here is to block W out of the middle of the board.  This is an excellent idea, but the wrong execution.  You still want Q15.  After Q13 W can still easily push into the middle.  See variation.]

(;W[qg]C[W is fighting a hopeless battle.  He needs to escape, not make tiny life.]
;B[pe]CR[pc][qd]C[Now we're talking!  B has a substantial advantage.  Look how this severely limits W's options.  Keep an eye out for that tiger's mouth shape.  It's not always correct (no shape is), but it's always worth considering.]
;W[rd];B[rc]
(;W[qf]C[Another local mistake from W.  Q14 is much better.  See variation.]
;B[pf]C[Disaster for W.];W[rj];B[pl]SQ[qk]C[This is not correct.  When your opponent is crawling along the 2nd line it's most common simply to allow him to push you along the 3rd.  R9 is the move here.  See variation for the problems that this causes.]

(;W[ci]C[Logical framework development from W.];B[cg]SQ[jd]
[dm][dn]C[Too small!  This sort of move (a 1-point jump between two safe groups) is something that should happen at the very end of the opening.  There are MUCH larger points available here.  W has made what is called a "double wing" formation at the bottom left.  That requires a response from you, as it can lead to a very big territory.  D6 or D7 are good approaches, and are very urgent right now.  K16 is a big point for you, but less urgent.  Even R5 or Q5 would be much better than your C13.  Keep your eye on the big moves early on.]
;W[ck]SQ[ep]C[Shocking.  A normal base is a 2-point jump (so C8).  If the C11 stone were isolated that would be the right move.  But this is within W's territory, so there is no need for this tiny, piddling stuff.  E4 is what I would have chosen.]
;B[jj]TR[ee][ff][gg][hh][ii][kj][lj][mj][nj][oj]SQ[jd][cm][fp]
C[Tengen (the center point) is always tempting because it is aesthetically pleasing.  But it usually isn't all that important.  Here the stone is too close to your wall on the right and too far from your stones on the left.  It coordinates very poorly with your overall structure.  If you wanted to make a moyo you need to be nearer to the top, like K16.  However, you still need to play in the bottom left right away.  C7 and F4 are reasonable approaches.  C7 makes W's side group very uncomfortable, so it's probably what I would choose.]
;W[jc]C[W does what you should be doing.. keeps you from making a big framework.]

(;B[lc]CR[pc][qd][pe][pf][pg][ph][qj][pl]SQ[hc]C[Wrong direction.  If you have a big, nasty wall you want to push your opponent INTO it.  To newer players it feels like "giving up" territory, but you will recoup that territory on the other side.  Your opponent will have a much harder time settling a group agaisnt your wall.  H17 is the answer here.  See variation.]
;W[gc];B[fb]SQ[ge]C[Too small.  Your thought is to attack the base, but your opponent can still move into the center and get plenty of territory.  Reacting to F18 directly is playing scared.  G15 is a good response for W.  That or F15 is a good way for you to attack these stones (though the bottom left is still more important).  See variations.]

(;W[gb]C[W overreacts to a non-threat.];B[ga]C[Same thing.]
;W[ha]C[W should not be responding to these.];B[fa];W[ib];B[kb]
C[You are attacking eye space, but W can get plenty more in the middle.  W can do much more damage by playing out into the middle with G15 and then K15 as your top priorities (to make a box-like shape).]
;W[jb]C[Absurd.  This doesn't save W an eye, it just gives you another move.  W could just as well have passed.]
;B[jd]C[Quixotic.  What are you attempting here?  Your new stone is weak and unconnected while your opponents stones are strong.  You have to know exactly what sequence you expect to play out.  If you're not sure, stay away from this type of move.  It makes for complicated fights.  You don't need to kill this W group, you just want to bully it while keeping your strength to gain territory around it.  Right now W can live by playing K19 for two eyes (J19 and H18 would be the eyes).  So you need to forget about killing the group.  Just use it to make profit.]
;W[id];B[fe]SQ[cm][fp]C[You wisely abandon the misplay of K16.  This is not a bad move locally, but the bottom left is still begging for attention.]
;W[je];B[kd]C[No, just forget the stone!  It's not important to you.  Losing it doesn't theaten any of your groups, and killing it barely makes your opponent stronger.  Look for the big plays.

There is a tendency amongst new players to be overly defensive of stones on the board.  I have heard more experienced players advocate sacrificing whenever you can as a new player just so you get used to it.  I'm not sure I'd go that far, but always ask yourself: "If I lose this stone, does that threaten any *other* stones?"  If not, it is a good candidate for sacrifice.]
;W[ie]
(;B[ge]C[Miniscule.  You are not any stronger because of this move.  If you are trying to kill the W group you have misread the life and death situation.  W is completely alive (see variation).  This is where my advice at the very beginning comes in.  If you get good at life and death tsumego you will be able to play this position much more effectively.]
;W[jf]C[Useless.  W can safely jump to K13 from here, so why play this?  It makes no sense.  Also, the bottom left is much bigger.]
;B[hg]TR[fg][eh][di]SQ[cm][fp]C[This move is smaller than it seems.  In fact, it is worth almost no points at all.  The W group is still alive, so it's not a good attack.  And W can easily play into this territory from his group on the left.  There are still huge points left on this board, mainly in the bottom left.

Whenever you're playing Go you need to keep track of two things.  First, are there any weak groups that could be threatened?  Second, where are the biggest points?  If there are no obvious weak groups then you need to slow down your play and look at the whole board to find the big points.  H13 clearly isn't one.]
;W[kf]C[Inexplicable.  What is W doing?  If W wants to mess with B's territory then jump to M14.  I have no idea what W is trying to do with these stones.]
;B[lf]C[It seems to be like you are following W's lead.  Don't be the blind following the blind.  If W wants to crash his stones into your wall by all means let him.  There are much bigger moves to be made.]
;W[jg]C[I can't explain this.];B[lg]C[More blind following the blind.]
;W[gm]SQ[ep]C[This is a blow.  It's not an ideal move from W's perspective (I would play E4).  But it makes things harder down there.  Now you have to figure out how best to reduce W's territory.]
;B[jm]SQ[po]C[This is not a terrible idea, but it gives W credit for too much.  You can start at Q5 if you want to attack from above.]
;W[mp]C[Reasonable from W, but there are still opportunities for B in the bottom left corner.  B needs to take one of them now!]

(;B[mn]SQ[dq][eq][fq][gq][hq]C[You are giving up on the bottom.  That is a problem, because it is an enormous territory for W.  I know it looks imposing, but there are 5 points between W's two stones.  You have to find life down there.  See the variation for how to approach this.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[ko]C[W lets you in!];B[in];W[jo];B[hm];W[io]
;B[hn]SQ[ho]C[Why not H5?];W[go]
(;B[gl]C[This lets W get back control of the situation.  You actually had some good opportunities to invade here.  See variations.]
;W[fm];B[fl]TR[di][ei][fi][gi]C[These moves are aimless.  You are saying "sure, take those hundred points on the bottom, I'll take my 10 at the top."  W's group at C11 still totally invalidates any "territory" you are making here.  This all points to learning how to manage an invasion in your opponent's moyo.  It is an important skill.  You can play much more confidently if you can do it.  It is a high level skill though, so you will have to accept some failures as you learn it.  But that's much better than giving up!]
;W[el];B[ek];W[dl];B[dk]C[Ouch!  This is one of the worst shapes you can make.  Bumping your head against your opponent's stones like this is almost always bad.  What territory does this make?  In general you need to be thinking "are there any weak groups?" and then "how can I make territory?"  This addresses neither of those issues.]
;W[ln];B[km];W[lm];B[mm]SQ[ll][qo]C[This is still all small stuff.  Locally, M8 would have been right here.  But this is not an important area to be playing in.  R5 is larger than your last 6 moves put together.  Remember the standard advice: corners, then edges, then middle.  Here you're messing around in the middle when there is still edge territory left.]
;W[ll];B[lj]TR[jg][ll]C[This stone is between two white groups.  Thus, by definition it will not gain you territory.]
;W[mk];B[nj];W[nk];B[ok];W[ol]
(;B[nl]TR[oj][pk]C[You've left W two atari points here.  You can't hope to save N6 while those weaknesses exist.  See variation.]
;W[om]C[Uh oh!];B[on]
(;W[nm]C[Wrong direction from W.  See variation.  This makes your previous mistakes look like good plays, but they aren't.]

(;B[nn]C[Still the wrong direction.  See variation.]
(;W[ml]C[Ack, what is W doing!  See variation.];B[pm];W[nl]
;B[kl]TR[pn]C[Wait, what about the cutting point at Q6?  You play this whole sequence to get your stones around there, then leave yourself open to being cut!  You need a stone around Q5 to protect.]

(;W[ho]SQ[pn][fp]C[More odd play from W.  F4 completely defends this point (see variation), but there are more important places to play anyway.  Namely, Q6.]
;B[qo]C[Thank you.  This is a big point.];W[qp];B[pp];W[po]
;B[op];W[qn];B[ro];W[rp];B[oo]C[Good reading to get this right.]
;W[oq];B[rn]C[This is pretty small.  Maybe you're still scared of Q6?  But if you read it out you know you're right so you shouldn't worry.]
;W[np];B[mo]C[This just wastes a ko threat.  W has an easy response.  No reason to play this move now.]
;W[lo];B[rk];W[ri];B[hd];W[hc];B[hf]
(;W[ja]C[W doesn't need this to live.  See variation.];B[ka]
;W[kc];B[ma];W[ld];B[md];W[le];B[me];W[ke];B[kh]C[Oops, N17 is still a weakness.]
;W[lb];B[la];W[mb];B[nb];W[na];B[oa];W[ma];B[mc]C[Oops again!  Always try to attack your position from your opponent's point of view.  This little mistakes are easy to pick up if you just take a moment to attack your own position.  They add up to a lot of points too.]

;W[ii];B[jh];W[dj];B[gi];W[ej]C[Stop here for a moment.  Go back and replay moves 63-69.  See how useless those were now?  W just goes around the side.  Those stones got you exactly nothing.  It was a Maginot line.  Imagine if those stones had gone into invading the bottom left instead!  Always resist the urge to "carve out" territory in the middle when your opponent has easy access points to that territory.  You will soon lose it (well, you never had it to begin with).]
;B[dh];W[gk];B[hl];W[kk];B[jk];W[lk];B[kj];W[mj];B[mi]C[Whoops.  O11.  Beginners often try to hang on to territory they thought they owned, even once it becomes clear that they were in error.  N11 clings to territory that isn't really yours.]
;W[oj];B[oi]
(;W[pk];B[qk];W[ni];B[nh];W[nj];B[pj];W[ok];B[qi]SQ[bh]C[This is a 1 point move.  You only played here because you didn't pause to look at the board (it was close to other recently played stones).  Slow down your play.  See whether your groups are in danger (they are not in this case).  If not, look for bigger points.  B12 is worth much more.]

[so][qp][rp][sp]C[There are two things for you to focus on.  First, which is true of almost all players at all levels, is to get better at life and death.  That would have made the difference in this game, as you would not have wasted several moves on W's group at the top, which was already alive at the time.

Second, you seemed to lack confidence in invading the bottom left.  That is a complicated skill, but it is important to learn.  The main thing is to be happy to sacrifice stones just to get something alive.

Finally, I would urge you not to play those "speculative" types of moves within your opponent's territory at the end (starting with move 211).  If you see a weakness then read it out.  But don't just go fishing for mistakes.  It doesn't make your game stronger.

I hope this helps you to improve your game!  Please let me know if you have any questions about my comments, any of the Japanese terms (you can find all of these at senseis.xmp.net), or any variations.]
