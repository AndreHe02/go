C[Hello,
I played black in this game and I thought I had the advantage after the fuseki. Somehow I fell behind and I'd appreciate it if you can tell me why.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo];W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[og];W[qg];B[iq]TR[kq]
[nq]LB[jq:A]C[sita: this is definitly the right direction, but maybe one point too far. At the two marked intersections w can maybe establish a base later. If you had moved to A this would not have been possible. Anyway, no big mistake which could lose the game.]
;W[jp];B[fq]LB[ip:A]TR[jp]C[sita: I would suggest A, making w's marked stone heavy and a target too attack. You are strong in the lower right. Use it!]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[jq];W[fn];B[lp]TR[jq][iq][fq]C[sita: After you invested so many low moves in this area, playing there got quite slow. I would suggest an invasion at the left side.]
;W[jc];B[le]TR[dn][fn][dc][jc]C[sita: Way too slow. You look totally overconcentraded at the top now. Still the left side looks more promising. W is planning a huge framework there with his marked stones.]
;W[je];B[ch]C[sita: Finnally. Very good point!];W[cj];B[ce]
;W[cd];B[de];W[fd];B[eo]C[sita: Too direct (see my comments a few moves later). The right side becomes interesting now.]
;W[do];B[en];W[em];B[fm];W[fl];B[gm];W[gl];B[hm];W[hl];B[im]
;W[eh]C[sita: Look, w's fast development against your overconcentrated shape on the lower edge. Let's estimate the score:
White:
Left:  30
Upper: 25
Right: 10
Total: 65 Points + Komi

Black:
Lower: 50
Rest : 10
Total: 60, but sente

All in all it seems quite equal, but b has a week group on the left side, w nearly no weaknesses.]
;B[di]TR[eo]C[sita: Again this move, like the marked one. This move doesn't typically lead to a good position. You are really in a need to make eyes!]
;W[dj];B[ei];W[fh];B[bd]C[sita: So, what were the last two moves good for?]
;W[bc];B[dd];W[cc];B[ed];W[ec];B[fe];W[ge];B[gd];W[fc];B[gf]
;W[he];B[ef];W[qm]LB[qk:B][pm:C][oo:A]C[At this point I considered the moves: A (p5), B(r9) and C(q7). Finally I played A, but after the game i got the feeling that B was better.

sita: I think, you are right here. Maybe w should have played B himself. But even C looks better than A: Too small and overconcentrated again.]
;B[oo];W[qj];B[pl]C[sita: very nice point now!];W[ql];B[hg]
;W[pm];B[gi]C[sita: Good! Tenuki is fine.];W[ej];B[fi];W[jm]
;B[jn]LB[il:A][el:B]C[sita: That's what w wants, with this ugly move. How about A? There is a weakness at B to aim on later.]

;W[hr]C[After h2 i should have defended at h3 i think, but i didn't notice that the aji of g5 was so strong.]
;B[gs];W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[hp];W[hs];B[ir];W[fs];B[kk];W[kl]

;B[ep];W[sk];B[pg];W[fj];B[sf]C[sita: Even now the game is close, if w answers at s16.

Some general remarks:
I think, you focus too much on secure territory. I want to illustrate that on the m4 stone. Surely you got some territory on the lower side, no question. But: If you had not played there, you would have had a fuseki move elsewhere on the board, maybe on the left or on the upper side. That would reduce w's prospects there a lot. Furthermore, if w would had invaded the lower side later on, he would find this group under severe attack from strong b positions. Thus, you could build even stronger positions and map out territory on the right, e.g. The moral is: Play light and flexible, grasp big and important points, don't produce own weak groups - and leave the territory for the endgame. ;-)]
