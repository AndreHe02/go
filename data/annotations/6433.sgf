C[Hey Sinse,

Sorry I don't speak French - But I will do my best to review your game.

- Derek];B[dd];W[dp];B[pd];W[pp]
(;B[pj]C[This move is O.K, but slow. Generally, you want to approach an enemy stone now.]
;W[jp];B[qn];W[cf]
(;B[fc];W[jd]C[White made a mistake - He played on the fourth line in an area that Black is strong in.

4th line is for influence, not territory - It's harder to make a base with.

Therefore, to punish white, you can take his base away while expanding your corner.

Also, White started an approach and didn't finish it. His lone white stone is weak.]

(;B[cj]LB[ch:A]TR[pp]SQ[cf]C[Keep in mind that White never responded to your approach. You can punish him harder for that.

This move is a little weak - You could play closer to White's stone and take away it's base.

For example, A instead.];W[fh]C[Bad move by W - It doesn't do anything.]
;B[jc]LB[hc:C][lc:A][mc:B]C[Don't touch a weak stone. It only makes it stronger. This is NOT an attack.

A B or even C are attack points, but going directly under only makes it stronger.]
;W[qf]TR[jd]C[W cannot afford to tenuki. You should ignore it and Hane (Turn the corner) on the White stone.

See variation.]
(;B[nc]LB[ic:A][id:B][kd:C][cm:D]TR[jc][cj]C[Play urgent moves before big moves.

On top, your stone is attached to his. Whoever plays there first gets a huge advantage. If White Hane's at A, you lose a lot. If you Hane at B or C, white hurts a lot.

The left is also urgent. If you play D, you have a base. If White plays D, you have to struggle to live - And White will profit on top, left, or middle while you fight, although you will probably live.]
;W[jj]TR[cc][ic][kc][qc][qh][qi][ql][cm][cq][gq][mq][qq]C[Not yet time. There's holes all over the place.

Secure the corners and sides before center. Note that NONE of the sides or corners are set territory yet - They can all be invaded.

Marked points are all invasion points for one color or the other.]
;B[qh]TR[jc][jd][cf][cj][cm]C[Again, you should be playing the urgent moves.

Marked stone/areas are urgent.];W[gp]TR[jd][qf][mk][cl][cm]
[cn]C[W cannot afford to be ignoring these moves. The marked stones are in critical condition.

This move is also over crowded. The triangled area is where the most unclaimed territory is, even if it wasn't a critical spot.]
;B[np]C[Good - Attack the lone stone. However, there are other stones that are still much weaker.]
;W[cq]C[Great move by White, solidified the lower left.

Note that you can still invade. (Not that you should -- But the area isn't solid territory yet.)]

(;B[bp]C[No, you need to make a base.

Also, the stone is likely dead - Too far in.];W[cm];B[cn];W[bq]

All these groups are very weak. Compare the side of what W got with what B got.]

;W[lc];B[lb];W[ic];B[ib]TR[jb]C[Again, you should play solidly instead. Triangle is much better.]
;W[jb]C[Your groups are split, your stones are weak and W is strong.
