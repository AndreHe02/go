C[I feel I played much better than my opponent in the beginning of the game, and I didn't make any obvious blunders, but he managed to build a bigger moyo than me and win. This is unusual for me -- usually if I lose, I made some kind of obvious mistake, or there was complicated fighting going on and I came out behind. Please help me figure out where I went wrong. I think my biggest mistake was letting black play G14 on the boundary of the moyos. Do you agree?

K: I added a general comment at the end of the game, I hope this would be helpful!

K: K3 is a very good move, you can't let black play here, or he will be too solid to use your thickness.
The extra profit on the right, while attacking, is a welcomed extra.

In general, it is almost always good to reply to a shoulder hit with an extension. And moves like J3 (armit hit) are almost always bad, if they are not needed to live locally.]

Now it is time to think about the upper right, that is still open.
I count W: 55 points, B:40+upper right. even a simple 3-3 invasion can give you 10 points, 15-20 to black, and you can control the game until the end.

K post review: yes, G14 was a big turnaround in this match, it changed the whole flow of the game, from a peaceful moyo building in the center, to a messy fight with groups in danger and captured stones from every side.
After the opening you was clearly ahead in points, you lose some points by finishing in gote and letting black defend the upper right before your invasion or approach. Than made your plans difficult and you had to rely much more on the center.
Taking the upper right first, you would have been ahead without the need to take points in the center.
10 points invading in R17, allowing black to do a strong wall facing the center, in return, but you had your walls too, to balance, and the rest of the game could be a simple "reduce safely every new territorial framwork until the end", keeping the lead.
It seems like you rarely played against he chinese opening, it can be really tricky, because it rely on letting you invade and then attacking the invasion (see at move 51).
Dealing with this opening, even in midgame, can be really hard, because it produce violent fights, expecially against another influence oriented opening like your (the double hoshi)

I hope it was helpful, if anything is unclear, of my english is too strange, you can often find me online on KGS as kaiou, or H.
