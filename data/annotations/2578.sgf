C[Hi! I'm very unhappy with this game. I thought that I was leading and I lost. I would like you to emphasize the biggest mistakes I made, the aspects of game the I should get better.

Thank you in advance!

Ronin: Hi! I'll try to be of some use :-) Please note that when I say "see variation" you have to go one move back to find the variation.]

C[I am not sure this was the proper way to play here...

Ronin: since white left the joseki unsettled and played light I would feel to do the same and play something like A(H3). Your move is metal solid, this is after all a good thing.]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]LB[kc:A][kd:B]C[Is it the right thing to do? Would a pincer at A for example do better?

Ronin: I think your move is ok, it keeps the game clear, a good thing. Thinking of pincering, however, I'd prefer B(L16), see variation.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[gq]LB[lc:A]C[Ronin: here white leaves another joseki unsettled. Black should be looking for the time to play A(M17).]
;B[dp]LB[co:A]C[Ronin: why not A(C5) instead?];W[co]TR[dp]C[Ronin: the exchange of the two triangled stones (D4, C5) is good for white, cause he left the joseki unsettled but black forced him to protect. This sounds like a "thank you move".]
;B[jq]LB[iq:A]C[Ronin: this pincer could be at A(J3) to be more severe.]
;W[ip];B[jp]LB[hp:A]C[Ronin: cutting at A(H4) instead would put white on the spot, while hovewer complicating the fight. Your response is clear and firm, so is ok.]
;W[fp];B[po]LB[en:B][fo:A]SQ[fp][ip][gq]CR[co]C[Ronin: the triangled stone (Q5) is a really good point. Black would like to pursue the squared group (F4) but can you see now how valuable is the circled stone (C5) for white? Now black will find hard to fight with either A(F5) or B(E6). However, this is another place where to look for a future good move (A or B).]
;W[qi]
(;B[ql]LB[qk:A]C[Ronin: Black could put more pressure with A(R9) hoping white will try to escape towards the center (see variation).]

[cm]C[What do you think of the situation of the game now? Is anyone leading?

Ronin: well the game is wide open, however let's try to examine the situation. Black seems to be ahead in territory and has a good moyo in the lower right corner while white has chances to get a big moyo towards the center but a number of weak groups. I cannot say that someone is definitely leading, black and white showed the opposite philosophy, up to now it seems a Solid vs Speed match.]

C[I am not sure at all of this move... I felt that I had to invade somewhere, but where? C17?

Ronin: I don't agree about invading now. Black has secured territory and good influence, moreover he has lots of groups to attack. I think here black can choose between various opportunity: 
- enforce the lower right moyo with something like A(k6), that is also an attacking move to the white circled (F4) group, or someting like B(P8), that also attacks the triangled stone (R11)
- attacking the squared group (O17) with C(M17) to take position in the upper side

Hovewer speaking of invading, the sansan at D(C17) could be an opportunity to make more solid territory and to let white get thickness to further reduce while attacking his weak groups.]

(;B[oc]LB[ks:A]C[Ronin: Playing A(L1) here is a must. The two white groups are cut so the right one could be killed (see variations).]

;W[cf];B[ie]C[This is probably a stupid move

Ronin: I fear you are right :) Here the spot is the other side. If black can block the other direction the two white lone stones are almost as good as lost.]
;W[je];B[mg]LB[kh:A][mj:B]C[Ronin: you play from you thickness, instead  you should play toward it, pushing the opponent. Here I can see A(L12), or B(N10).]
;W[ki];B[kh];W[lh];B[kg];W[kj]C[Ronin: letting white get such a good shape is bad.]
;B[lf]LB[nj:A]C[Ronin: black has to keep the pressure, so I think this move should be around A(O10) to cut the white groups.]

[el][cm][dm][cn][kr][is][js][ls]C[Here I thought that the situation was at my advantage: three corners and the center neutralised. Was I wrong?

Ronin: Let's try a positional judgement:
BLACK SECURED TERRITORY:
- bottom right corner: about 18 pts
- upper right corner: about 14 pts
- bottom left corner and left side: about 10 pts
TOTAL: about 42 pts but with average endgame can rise to 50

WHITE SECURED TERRITORY:
- upper left corner and upper side: about 40 pts
- left side: about 6 pts
- bottom side: about 4 pts
- center: about 6 pts
- captured stones: 1 pt
TOTAL: about 57 pts but with average endgame can rise to 65 plus komi.

It seems that white is far ahead. You underestimate the value of the upper left territory.]

Thanks a lot!

Ronin: ok, I'll try to put some conclusion. I think you had a better fuseky, due to your fondness to thickness. However you missed the chance to attack severely more than once. If you go for thickness your aim should be to trap the opponent in disadvantageous fights and hence to gain something from it. I think that this could be the lesson of this game: use you power to costantly let your opponent feel your claws in his flesh :-) You had a better endgame than white, but it wasn't enough. I hope I hadn't say too many unresonable things :-) 
See you,
