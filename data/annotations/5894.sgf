;B[pd]C[A: Thanks for making the review
this was a close game untill he made a mistake in yose.
i am not sure about my respond to his attack in the middle game+my group which almost died

N: hello, i preceded my comments with N:,
seeing this game, it appears to me as if you underestimate the value of simple defensive moves. If you think about this and get aware of it, you will certainly improve.

Regards,

;B[ec]C[A: trick play

N: nice, if you also know the continuation];W[bd];B[ee];W[fd]
;B[fc];W[be]
(;B[gd]C[N: this is a bad move, you should make good shape by making a net. The ladder is very bad because you end in gote and give your opponent another move as ladderbreaker.]
;W[qp];B[fe]C[A: i felt i need to take off the aji
although my fuseki look slow

N: off course, see previous comment];W[co];B[op];W[oq];B[nq]

(;B[np]LB[mp:A]C[N: oldschool states that this move should have been at 'a'.]
;W[qn];B[jq]
(;W[qf]C[N: not sure about where black's next move should be]

(;B[ph]C[A: pincer using g16?

N: seems like you expect to much that your opponent will jump into the corner.]

;B[ob];W[ma];B[pb]C[N: white lost bigtime here, he gave away his opening advantage.]

(;W[cj]SQ[bd][be][co]C[N: white is very low on the left, also, the shimari wants to devellop to tha right]
;B[fq]C[A: too wide?
i felt its the big point

N: seems logical, you don't want to give white a double wing]

(;W[hq];B[dr]C[N: good move];W[er];B[eq];W[cr]
(;B[fr]LB[dp:A]C[N: this is not optimal, you should first force at 'a']
;W[ds];B[en]C[N: the overall result is good for black];W[ho]

(;B[cn]LB[jo:A]C[N: this is an overplay, there is absolutely no need to play so agressive, simply chasing the white stones with 'a' seems sufficient.]
;W[do]
(;B[dn];W[eo];B[fo];W[fn]C[A: greedy black?

N: you give white another chance.];B[fp]C[A: bad shape but i couldnt spot a better move]

(;W[iq]C[N: no need for white to play here already];B[ir];W[jp]
;B[kp];W[jo]C[N: white can't afford to end in gote, the battle on the left is too important.]

(;W[ji];B[bo];W[bp];B[bm];W[cl];B[bl];W[dl];B[ap]C[A: after the game we saw e7 cut.
i would be behind after this cut?

N: not by much but i think you would be slightly behind.]

;B[ij];W[jj];B[bk];W[bj];B[hk];W[jk]
(;B[im]C[A: i felt its big
but maybe r10 was the right move?

N: it is not so big, but could be sente if you can seperate and divide the groups afterwards. On the other hand, r10 puts you ahead on territory, and (again) it is easier ;-)]
;W[qg];B[re];W[qh]
(;B[jc]LB[jb:A]C[N: the right place to play is 'a', right now it doesn't work, but it will with some extra stone in the neighbourhood, so this is aji keshi (wasted aji)]
