AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hi,  I played Black in this 3-stone game. I lost by resignation.

For much of the game I felt pushed around by overplays
(which my opponent cheerfully agreed he was doing, to see what I would do).   I would be grateful if you could identify some of the overplays, and how I could have responded better, or any other mistakes you think are worth correcting.  (I also misplayed an unfamiliar joseki at the beginning, but I have since looked it up in Ishida.)

I have  included a number of specific questions as comments.

Thank you.

krv: really you are ahead almost all the game. Even at the end you have ways to fight (after your last move game was almost even). Thus almost all your moves were almost ok ). But of course you missed some tesuji, I will try to show some (not all, I'm not 9d).]
PL[W];W[pq];B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[ro]C[The unfamiliar move -- i've now looked it up in Ishida.]
;B[pp]C[My poor response -- up through
B16, all improvised.];W[qq];B[oq];W[pn];B[on];W[pm];B[qk]C[Should this have been on the lower side, at around K3, taking he big point and making a base right away?

krv: here almost all moves works good. K3 works too. May be P7 is a bit better.]
;W[rm];B[qh];W[iq];B[kq]C[Making a base, but too narrow, maybe?

krv: good move];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[cl]C[Was this W21 the result of some mistake I made?
krv: No. normal sequence, you can't take all good points.];B[dl]
C[Should I have pincered instead, near C10 or C11?  I wanted to strengthen the black stones in preparation for attacking the bottom W group.

krv: yes, you should pincer. Anyway you give your opponent a choice - to strenghten your group or give away all left side]
;W[dk];B[el];W[cm];B[cn]C[Is this as bad as just having played B22 at C6?  I thought, at least, I'm getting ready to attack W's
bottom third-line group.

krv: You could play black 22 at C7. But pincers were better.]
;W[cq]C[Overplay?

krv: yes];B[er]C[Keeping him separated.];W[bp];B[bn]TR[dk][cl]
[cm]C[Keeping him separated -- maybe I can soon attack the triangle stones, too.]
;W[cr]
(;B[ar]LB[ci:c][gr:b][bs:a]TR[dk][cl][cm]C[Kill.  But should I have pincered the
triangle stones right away, instead, somewhere around C?
Or maybe jumped to B?

At the time I thought W32 would
make it live, if I didn't play inside.

krv: I don't think this is killing move. I believe that white are dead as they are. But anyway you are ahead.]
;W[fr]
(;B[eo]LB[dm:a][en:b]C[I feared the push at A followed by cut at B.]
;W[cj];B[ek]C[Wrong response?];W[ej];B[fj];W[ei];B[jo]C[I still wanted to attack W's bottom group.  Wrong attacking move?]
;W[ho];B[im]LB[mo:a]C[Here I thought, getting some territory around A and below.]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[hr]LB[gn:a];B[fi]LB[gn:a]C[I didn't want W to bend on me at B46.I considered playing at A, but too slow?]
;W[eh]
(;B[cg]C[So that W does not profit from his
4th-line stones -- but  now it looks  too close to W thickness, and W took sente anyhow.

Better move?

krv: your move is ok. May be C14 a bit saver. But F12 is good here too. While white get big left - your moyo in center grows huge.]
;W[fh];B[gh];W[fn]C[I had not foreseen this.];B[en];W[om];B[nn]
;W[ce]TR[cg]C[An overplay? Or the punsihment
for playing the marked stone too close to thickness?];B[de]
C[Poor response?];W[cf];B[df];W[bg];B[dg]LB[bh:a]TR[ce][cf]
[bg]C[Too small?  Here I thought I was threatening to play at A, which he did answer.
krv: C16 a bit better.];W[bh];B[cd]LB[or:a]C[Too small? I had also considered playing at A.  Maybe they are miai?

krv: A is small after p7-o6 exchange. G13 is huge now.];W[or]
;B[nq];W[nm]LB[cd:a]TR[or]C[I suppose that playing at the triangle and then at W65 would have been bigger than the move I made at A?]
;B[mn];W[qf]TR[cf]C[First the triangle move, then W67.

Are these invasions a regular flow, or have I neglected some standard  prevention?]
;B[pf]C[Is this correct response?];W[pg];B[qg];W[pe];B[of];W[qe]
;B[oe];W[qd];B[pc]C[krv: There should be a question. Really this is not the best move. R17 is obviously better - vars are very wide to explain, you should remember this )]
;W[qc];B[pb]C[krv: again - R18 keeps your points.];W[qb];B[qa]
C[krv: too late. Now R19 is bad. After exchange you get very bad aji P16.]
;W[ra];B[pa];W[sb];B[jd]C[Here I thought the top now has gigantic potential, he will invade, so I should make some protective move to hold at least part of it.

Was B84 reasonable, or obviously inadequate?  Bad things happened,
afterwards.]
(;W[oh]C[I never did have time to play at W85 myself, earlier...]
;B[oj]C[Keep him separated from the W stones below -- I hoped to capture the two W cutting stones. Also B's right side group needs to run, it seems. Trying to do too much?

krv: seems normal];W[mh];B[mj];W[kh];B[ml]C[Here I thought I was relieving the
pressure on the B right side group.
But then...

krv: your connect isn't  the most solid and there is no point to enclose O7 group. May be N15 - this protects top and give some pressure on P12.]
;W[mc];B[me]C[Still keep him separated.];W[jb];B[ic]TR[pg][kh]
[mh][oh]C[Should he have been able to live
here?  My thought was that even if he did, then I could turn around and capture the triangle stones on a large scale, and surely win.  But it didn't work out...

krv: too much to count. Shape move is L17];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb]

(;B[gb]C[Was this move a terrible mistake ?
Later developments suggest I should have kept playing on the third line.

krv: good point to take center.];W[gc]
(;B[fc]C[krv: obviously mistake.];W[gd];B[fb];W[kd]C[I never saw that move coming...]
;B[ke];W[ld];B[jf]LB[le:a]TR[pg][kh][mh][oh]C[Defending tagainst a push at A,
and helping to ensure the capture of the triangle stones, I thought.]
;W[jc];B[id]LB[gf:a][jj:b]TR[hc][ic]C[I thought the triangle stones were important cutting stones, and that I would eventually get to play around A and capture the two W stones.

Should I just have let them go and played something like B instead?

krv: hard choice. J13 may be. You are ahead very big];W[nb]
;B[od]C[krv: This is big yose, but there is some moves to go to yose.]
;W[ig];B[gg]TR[eh][fh]C[Here I thought, keep him separated from the triangles.

krv: bit late. You should cut at K13 now.];W[hi]C[I am now paying for the undefended cutting points.]
;B[gi];W[hj];B[gl]TR[fn][ho][fp]C[Here I was keeping him separated from the triangles, while defending the cutting point.]
;W[jk];B[ji]C[Should I have been able to prevent him from getting eyes for his center group? (I didn't succeed.)

krv: 9d surely can. 1d vs 1d - a luck question. You are 3 stones weaker - last chance to give away as small as posible ) - you are still ahead, even if he lives in center.

now L10 is better. other way - H15 to protect your big hanged group.]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[kj];B[mi];W[hl]C[krv: good moment to connect.]

(;B[hm];W[il];B[ij]C[I was trying to create a clump whose capture would yield a dead shape.  His group survived, after all, in the end.

Did I make tactical inaccuracies, or was the plan wrong from the start?

krv: still M11 is better (let him live)];W[jm];B[kl];W[jl];B[jn]

[ik:a]C[He now has at least a seki, because of the liberties at A and B.  So the plan has failed.]
;B[km]LB[if:a]C[Here it seemed important to stay connected.  But should I have played  A instead, for instance?

krv: I like M13];W[gk];B[fk];W[hf];B[he];W[gf];B[ge];W[ff]
(;B[fe]TR[ji][ki][ij][jj][hk][ik]C[I thought, at least still get those two stones!  By now his center group has several ways to coneect out, so the marked stuff will become territory with prisoners and I can't prevent it.

So my big question, which maybe you have answered by this point,
could I have prevented the W group from living, or at least derived some other compensation for letting it live?

krv: cut is a problem, you shouldn't let him do this. G15 looks useless. Answer to your big quetions is very big too - and changes from move to move )]
;W[gm]C[Here I suddenly feared the left corner group was becoming vulnerable to a capturing race of some sort.  Was this totally imaginary?

krv: Really your partner was too kind in this corner. He have a very interesting chances.]

krv: not now.];B[mk];W[nj]
(;B[oi];W[ni];B[ph];W[og];B[mm]LB[kn:a]TR[mi][mj][lk][mk][ml]
C[I had  thought the triangles would have a serious shortage of liberties
problem if W could push at 166.
But now it looks as if whatever W might have tried  would fail.

Better move?

krv: of course protect right )];W[sj]
(;B[ri]C[Better move?];W[rg];B[rh];W[rf];B[rl];W[sl];B[qm]LB[nl:a]
C[A useless move!! It was made in support of some plan to capture
a monkey jump stone, but which I realized would not work about an instant after I placed the stone on the board.
Playing 174 at A instead looks interesting because of some upcoming W shortage of liberties,
but I did not see a sequence which either connects the group out or gives it two eyes.]
;W[rn];B[tt]LB[nl:a]C[B resigns.

(Here I saw no way to get two eyes or to connect.  But my opponent showed me later that simply playing at A forces
a connection in a few moves, and
keeps me in the game!

Even so, I feel that I made many earlier errors,  for which I would
like advice.
Thank you for your comments.)
