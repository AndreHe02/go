C[Hello, my name is Bernd Sambale. I'm playing as HonFu, 2k, on KGS. Maybe we will meet there one day?

I'm going to review your game now, and there is a lot to be said about direction of play, attack and defense, joseki choice and the strength and weakness of groups ... in the fighting down on the lower side I'm not sure myself how to think about it - but actually that is not the important point, because you had already won this game and lost it only by letting a large alive group die! Without this having happened, you would have certainly won!

Most kyu games end like this, mine as well. If we could all pay more attention for the life of our stones and the death of the opponent's stones, we would win more games. 

But let's start with this game!];B[qd];W[dc];B[pp];W[ep];B[ce]
C[Bernd: The main point about the opening is that you should always try to make your stones work together and care for that the opponent's stones don't work well together. In your joseki handling you both don't care enough for that, as you can see later.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[dd]C[Bernd: White should play safe as in the variation.]

(;W[bc]C[Bernd: But white insists on the corner ...];B[ec]C[Bernd: ... making you take the outside ...]
;W[cd];B[db];W[cc];B[ed];W[eb]C[Bernd: Now atari ...]
(;B[ef];W[fb]C[Bernd: This is gote. White could live in sente playing B15.]
;B[dk]C[We deviated from joseki here, but I don't think I ended too badly. D9 may have been too far?

Bernd: I don't know joseki well, but there should be a deal for both, one getting some territory, the other influence, or both get equal share of both. And both players should choose their joseki in concern to make their stones work together and having healthy positions. Neither white nor black have really accomplished this.

When you play out a sequence, try not to think too one-sided. Like: What do I get? Or: What do I destroy? Deal with each other - and try to get out of the deal with a slightly better result, concerning the whole board. And concerning joseki: The question is not if you play a joseki or if you deviate from it, but *why* you do so! Every of your moves should have a clear purpose. If you have an aim and you find a joseki which accomplishes this aim, alright. But why have you deviated? What was your reason?]
;W[dm];B[oc];W[cl];B[ck];W[cp]C[Bernd: Here white hurried a bit to settle the lower left, while the whole board was still open. Instead of D7 he could have gone for the right side or kakari in bottom right.]
;B[pj]C[Bernd: Now you got a really nice point.];W[nq];B[lq]
C[Bernd: Probably black wanted white to enter 3-3, to get a moyo. And white did know that this was rather good for black, so he didn't allow it.]
;W[no];B[pn]C[I keep playing this, even though the keima is supposedely correct. I don't know any pincer joseki at all.

Bernd: I also don't know the joseki, but I would have also played this move. While attacking, what move does while at the same time defending the corner, you have to make an effort to attack in a way, that won't hurt you later, after the attack is over. The keima wouldn't guard the side as well, the three black stones in the lower right wouldn't work well together. Q6 is fine.]
;W[iq];B[lo];W[pr];B[qq];W[qr]
(;B[gq]C[Bernd: I think, you should either answer in the corner to keep white weak, or try to attack him in from the outside, enlarging his own moyo. Why should you take the few points of territory from him if you already got far better prospects? Upper side is still open. Only invade if you have to, because you are behind! This move weakens in a way the right white group, because it helps your M-group. But you don't want to hunt white right into the upper right, where you have your own potential destroyed then.]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[ho];B[dq];W[eq];B[dp];W[eo];B[do];W[bn];B[cq]
;W[en];B[co];W[bo];B[bp]C[Bernd: So black has taken the corner from white. Quite expensive to allow. On the other hand, black got two weak groups on the outside. White just has to find a way to attack them right ...]

(;W[kp];B[lp];W[mr]C[Bernd: Wrong direction! What is down there? A few points? Since white allowed black to take the corner, he has to profit on the outside - not by connecting underneath on the line of defeat in gote. Always break out into the center. Only if that road is already closed, live!]
;B[lm];W[nm];B[ol];W[ml];B[ll];W[ei]C[Bernd: This is meant as a kind of double attack, I suppose. But since this stone has no connection to the other white position, it is mainly a weak stone all alone.]
;B[ch];W[eg];B[dg];W[fe];B[ff];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[bg]C[Bernd: All the moves white made, helped black, and gave white close to nothing. All the weakness in the left position is suddenly gone. White has two weak stones and one or two points more in the corner, which he probably would have got in the endgame anyway. White certainly played too friendly to you, helping you out, letting you live easily whereever you want!]
;W[fk]C[Bernd: White connects his weak stones back ...];B[lj]
C[Bernd: And black is far out.];W[pg]C[Bernd: White has fallen behind now and starts invading. But invading won't get him points, it will only help you to solidify your territory. On the other hand it's hard to see in which direction white should develop anyway. Since the white wall in the upper left has still that peephole in it, he can't expect to accomplish very much around there. Black has around 50 points, and white only maybe 30 - even if the invader survives! To me this seems like a lost game for white.]
;B[qh];W[pe];B[qe];W[qf]
(;B[lc];W[pd];B[pc];W[re];B[rd];W[qg]C[This might have been sente, but I ignored it because it looked like bad shape to me.

Bernd: There is no absolute sente. The question is: What is the threat? And if you don't care about the threat, then you don't have to take gote. But in this case what do you, black, want to do with your won game? Carry it home, I assume. So you should do what you can to keep whites stones as weak as you can - so that you can hunt him out further. If he settles, the attack is over. The weaker you keep him, the more territory you can solidify on the right and the upper sides. Now he is just asking you to solidify the right side - and you don't want to take this present?

The question again is not if you should tenuki or not, but *why* you tenuki. Always try to aim for some kind of profit, don't make random, joseki-like moves or tenukis!]

(;B[ne];W[qi];B[qj];W[pi];B[oi];W[ph];B[mk]C[Bernd: Good, one by one erase the aji in your position.]

(;W[kq];B[ge];W[fc]C[Bernd: Black gave white a good excuse to fix his hole. White is stronger, but what has black accomplished? He has only weakened this left group a bit. Not fatal - but one more mistake like that and ...]
;B[ic]C[Bernd: Although this is nice - letting him fix the wall and then render it useless. ^^ Still, you shouldn't endanger your own stones!]
;W[gf];B[if];W[he];B[ie];W[lf];B[ng];W[ee];B[de];W[fg]C[Bernd: At this point finally black has to become aware that his life is in danger. This group is worth about 40 points, and you just can't give a group of that size up! If you would just manage not to lose like this, by not caring for the weakness of your large groups, you would win a lot more games and certainly climb a few ranks. Possibly you know the feeling of getting stronger: Lower rankings just die on you, you don't even have to do much. So to get stronger: Care for the life and death of the stones!

(When I was a 6k, I didn't really count territory. Do you know, how you count the dead group? Count every dead stone twice, then the empty spaces in between, and finally the points of territory the dead group would have possessed, if it had lived.)]

(;B[ih]C[Bernd: This is a good move. But still: Of course living comes first.]
;W[dh];B[cg]C[Connecting here lost me the game. The rest of the game was trying to make enough points to recover enough points. I got greedy and lost my center later too.

Bernd: I think, the point of defense was earlier. Anyway, after you lost this group, the game is over (which it was before, but the odds have changed ^_°). The board is divided between white and black. Before you were in lead with maybe 20 points, now white has the 20 points lead. If you both display a comparable endgame skill, the result won't be changed.]

;W[fi];B[ri];W[rh];B[rj];W[rf];B[rr]C[Bernd: Now finally black erased the aji down there. Probably white didn't know the sequence mentioned earlier? Well - it doesn't help any longer anyway.]

;W[eh];B[gj];W[gi];B[cj];W[di];B[fl];W[ge]C[Bernd: Life and death is the heart of the game. Buy yourself the book: "1001 Life and Death Problems"! That is a great really, really helpful, and really not too hard. Solve a few problems every day. By this you not only develop your reading skill, you also get in the *habit* of reading - and in the habit of thinking in terms of strength, weakness, potential, life and death.

And you should practice how to count, so that you know if you can play it safe or if you have to take risks.]

(;B[ph];W[rh];B[ri];W[sg];B[og]C[Bernd: Normally allowing white to get an eye at the side is not so good. But here you have him almost surrounded, he still needs a second eye!]
;W[of];B[ng]C[Bernd: Hunt im out, make him scurry through space where he won't get points, and try to solidify top, center and right side territory. In this way you strengthen yourself and his chances of countering somehow get smaller and smaller.]

(;B[fb];W[da];B[fc];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg]C[Bernd: ... and confine white to the corner. Now your stones are the ones who work well together. Since white insisted on playing on the wrong side, it could have turned out all well for you, better as in the deviation from the joseki.]

(;W[ec];B[bc]C[Bernd: You defend ...];W[oc]C[Bernd: ... and white gets the kakari which at the same time is an extension from the upper left corner.
