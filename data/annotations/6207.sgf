C[Dear Reviewer!

My name is Bernd Sambale and I've been playing regularly for about a year. I'm HonFu on KGS (where this game was played) and here in the ladder.

This is a rather short game because my opponent got careless in the end. But earlier I made some decisions which would have certainly turned out bad for me if he had exploited my mistakes correctly. Of course I'd like you to comment my side in general, but I also want to know, where my opponent could have destroyed me with different moves.

(;W[ph]C[B.: I had doubts about this move. It was the first time I played it, with the obvious plan of forcing black, then attack M17.]
;B[of]C[B.: But now it seems rather like a thank you move with little prospects.

Play this before K17 if you really want it.];W[nf]C[W in trouble.]

;W[rc];B[rb];W[oh]C[B.: Since he let me play here, the honor of that misguided forcing move was restored to some extend, but I guess this was not really necessary to turn out well for me.]

;W[hi];B[gi];W[hj];B[gj];W[hk];B[hh];W[gh]C[B.: Luckily he let me cut here and fight back. Then he will hunt me in a loose ladder that doesn't work and allow me to settle easily. If he hadn't helped me like this ... well ... where should I have gone? After his sente-thickness at the bottom I had thought: Time to pray.]

(;W[ef]C[bad];B[eg];W[cf];B[cc]C[B.: By invading here he helped me a lot. Funny enough I just made exactly the same game losing mistake the day before ...]

;W[de];B[fe];W[fc];B[he];W[if]C[Here my opponent resigned. But still I have the feeling I didn't make the right directional decisions beforehand several times and actually could have well lost the game.

Of course I know most of the principles: Defend weak groups in time, don't allow your opponent thickness, when you have weak stones around and so on. But there seems to be still a lot of leeway: Maybe my group is strong enough after all? Maybe the move which doesn't make sense now, turns out useful later?

So I'd really like to have the judgement of a stronger player about my decisions. Thank you very much!]
