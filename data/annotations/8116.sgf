C[Hello and thanks for the review. I played as white and I almost always struggle when I do, it just seems that I always end up well behind. I won this game but only due to the error of my opponent. All tips are appreciated.

Hello, thanks for detailing your thoughts about specific moves. It helps me to review your game.
I'll only be going over a few concepts, rather than going into every single move because I think learning concepts is more important.
It's true that White (W) begins with one-step behind, but as long as you are able to snatch the chance to gain iniative from B, it should be okay. let me show you what I mean:]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[oc];W[dc];B[pp]C[There are many ways to attack Q4. See tree for examples. The key here, is to remember that even if W does look too aggressive and playing too far away from C4, approaching Q4 is not as foolhardy as it looks. This is because W has many options, as does B, but B does have to respond in one way or another.]
(;W[eq]C[Is the enclosure opening ok for white? Would my second move have been better on the 4-4? Attack his 4-4 with my third move?

It's a bit early to say whether you should have played 4-4 on your second move. I don't mind E3, it secures you a corner.

But, you can attack Q4 on your third move.];B[mq];W[qj]SQ[qg]
[qm]C[Trying to make a base.
Good idea. Giving yourself equally good options is always a good idea.]

(;W[hc];B[id];W[hd];B[ge];W[he]C[Trying to split the groups.
Good idea.
You can also try to reduce B's group on the left, too. B will still live, but W gets a little extra terr.]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[dd];W[re];B[rd];W[de];B[rk];W[dd];B[ae]
(;W[hq]C[Would a longer extension have been better?
I think so, yes.];B[jq];W[rj]C[By this point I certainly feel behind in the territory race.

Indeed. I think you can remedy this by keeping a few things in mind:
1. What are your opponent's weak groups? If you attack them, do they have to respond?
2. Box shapes as offensive and defensive. If you can make a neat box, then you don't need to play moves that force W to be flat.
3. Attacking before your opponent solidifies too much. As long as you have a plan to either make a base or run to safety without sacrificing too much, you should be OK.]

(;W[lf]C[Trying to destroy any potential middle frameworks (or at least reduce them)
OK. But instead of reducing B without gaining anything, there are options that allow W to gain terr while decreasing B's.]

It's a bad move, but it's not a great move. I would stop for a while and play R3. It is worth much more than g8. Then you can return to G8 if you like.]

Though, upon review I could have killed it with move 120 at A14...
Yep. Good of you to realise, even if you didn't play it in the game]

The invasion would be possible, even against a stronger opponent. Not much stronger, but it will work. It will be played differently, though.]

A couple of things to think about:
1. deciding which move is worth the most:
A) Moves that allow you to keep iniative. You play an endgame move, B responds. Your shot again.
B) Worth the most points. Is it on the 3rd line? 2nd? 1st? The more space underneathe it, the more points. 

of course, there are ways to count, but you don't have to worry about those now. Also, always make sure YOUR groups are safe first.]

(;W[dj]C[W can get away with jumping out further. W have C4 and E3 backing it up, while B is in a precarious situation. It is thin, with 2 cutting points if W fills D16 up. It doesn't have a base yet, either.

W can take advantage of this. While B is making a base (preferably being guided by W to make a small base) and running out (also guided by W, while W stakes out a framework for itself).  B is forced to play moves that secure no/little territory, while W gets lots. The idea is not to kill, but to make a profit. if B ends up dying, then that is a bonus.]
