AB[pd][dp][pp]C[This game was played on the KGS server. Black was JTron, White was Uelf. Komi was .5, Handicap H3.  Black believes himself to be 13k, White 11k, so a two stone handicap would be more appropriate if that were true; however, White wins by a good margin.

T: Hello, I am Tinwe, your reviewer, betka (2k) on KGS. If you have any questions concerning this review, feel free to contact me there or use e-mail. This is my first time making a review for the GTL, so if you have any suggestions on how to make it more understandable and usefull, I would be glad if you let me know too.]
;W[cn]C[White kakari.];B[fq];W[fn];B[dd]C[Black Hoshi, now has all four star points.

T: Good, w shape it the lower left is thin and needs no answer]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[cf];B[gc];W[fe];B[fd];W[ee]
(;B[ed]C[Does Black really need to respond to White's peep?  If White pushes, Black blocs, creating tiger mouth and a settled group.  So perhaps 12 was unnecessary.

T: yes. The cut is not dangerous.];W[cp]
(;B[dq]LB[cq:A]C[Black A would not be easily cut, perhaps this would be better and Black would have more options for an invasion of the left.

T: true again, A is much better. Maybe you were afraid, because it was a handicap game. Dont be, stronger players are not that much stronger ;)]
;W[cq];B[do]LB[dn:A]C[I think Black A would be better here as well; the peep does not seem to represent a real threat, and later White continues to block Black on the left.  A provides an opportunity to push/crawl on the left.

T: No, this is a good move! The only move in this shape. It is sente, because if w does not answer, you can cut. If you dont play there, w can hane at the top of your two stones and make great shape for his stones whenever he wants to. A is not doing the same job.]
(;W[co];B[kp]LB[jp:A]TR[fq]C[T: This is one move too far. A maintains a better connection with the F3 group, which is not exactly strong. Please remember that a 4 space extension is usually cuttable.]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[mp]LB[ip:A][iq:B][kq:C]C[T: now it is a must to protect your connection with A, B or C, else w will separate with B (see variation).]
;B[qm]
(;W[ic];B[mc];W[ld];B[lc];W[kc]
(;B[kd]TR[ge]SQ[md]C[Black was recently advised to cut more, and not to play so passively.  Therefore, given a choice of 28 or A, he chose to cut at 28.

T: the cut is good, surely better than the squared point, if that is, what A should have been ;) What I would also consider is separating the group from its alies on the left hoping to either attack w group or destroy the left]
;W[jd];B[ke];W[je];B[kf];W[kb]
(;B[me]C[Black 34 uses the net to capture White 25.

T: yes I can see what you are doing :) Capturing a cutting stone is usually the proper move, but here I dont think it can really escape. So you can play faster and take the right side.]
;W[mg];B[pg];W[pi]LB[ed:A][jd:H][pd:B][ee:G][pi:J][dj:2][pk:1]
[cp:F][kp:E][mp:I][pp:C][fq:D]SQ[iq]C[T: Lets first look at this invasion. It is destroying some territory you could have had on the right side if you played there first. I does not threaten the life of any of you groups: the top group is extremely strong, the corner enclosure on the bottom is strong and far away. It also has no big territory-destroying follow up. The white stone is lonely deep in your area of influence, but it has plenty of space to run, so you cannot kill it. 
Conclusion: This is the type of invasion, you want to attack, push around and get some advantage out of it, but, for the moment, it is no problem to tenuki this move. 

I give a possible line of attack after 1, although you probably wont play it immediately. 

Lets evaluate the board now: life of groups first. 
Black A and B are completely secure, C looks fine. There is fighting to be expected on the bottom, if white sees the squared hane and separates D and E, but lets say black feels ok there. 
White F is completely secure, G and H are strong if they are connected. If disconnected, H looks weak, but it can make eyes on the side with H18. G has a cutting point on D15. I and J stones are alive for the moment, but can be attacked. Other white stones are not important. 
Conclusion: Black is strong everywhere, w nowhere in real trouble, but can be forced to play in a certain way. 

Concerning territory, b is ahead, but it is handicap and it is clear that w needs only one move somewhere on the left side (D10) to make an incredible amount of points there. Black doesnt have a single move of similar value for himself.
Conclusion: Now its the time to invade or reduce on the left. 

What black would love to do is attack and get some stones in the center first to back up his invasion. Sadly, I didnt find any good attack on the H group, because H18 might be even sente against the corner :( So, I am not sure about the exact way to reduce, but the point 2 seems possible.]
(;B[qi]TR[pg][qm]C[T: dont attach to a weak stone, it will get strong and you will lose the opportunity to attack it. This move is standard, if it allows you to connect, but the marked stones are too far from each other.]
;W[qc]C[White san-san invasion.  This was a difficult decision for Black: which direction to block?  White will probably live, so how to minimize the damage?

T: the direction you chose is right, for on the top side your stone is nearer to the corner than on the right side. You are extremely strong in that area, so there might even be a way to kill unkonditionaly, but I am not entirely sure of it.]
;B[qd];W[rc]LB[pb:A]C[T: Since you have many stones in the area, you can try to kill with A, but it can get really complicated. (I only give a few short variations out of the many I tried. You can spent some nice time trying to understand this situation too ;))) I dont really advice you to try this unless you lose the game if you dont kill.]
(;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[rd]
(;B[qf]LB[re:A]C[T: here you can block at A. Then the corner is ko (although you dont have to play the ko immediately).]
;W[re];B[rf];W[pa];B[oa];W[qb];B[kh]C[T: good :)];W[lg];B[kg]
;W[mj];B[mf]C[T: not necessary, the cutting stone cannot come out.]
;W[ng];B[of]LB[kj:B][qj:A]C[T: not necessary either, you have so many stones there. You can continue attacking with A or B]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[og];B[pe]C[Uelf [9k?\]: smart. if you didn't close that, I would have had a great oportunity to make it really complicated for you, i think

T: well, I dont see anything he could have done :)];W[qj]C[JTron [12k\]: I almost didnt, too.

T: this hane is painfull :(];B[ri]C[Uelf [9k?\]: yes. i think it would have been save. though i really had something in mind, which would be quite messy for you and thanks to the point system it would cost me one point. i guess]
;W[pk]C[JTron [12k\]: *Whew*
Uelf [9k?\]: p17 would have played a role and maybe p16 too. my best hope was to get p19/18 :D]
;B[dn]LB[ch:C][ci:B][di:A]TR[kf][kg][kh]C[Black is concerned about White's potential territory on the side, but cannot get ahead here.  A reduction around A, B or C might be better for Black.

Uelf [9k?\]: i have to say that the board doesn't look as devastating for me as it did in the beginning. still devastating, but hope is in sight

T: Black has made wonderful thickness here to back up his invasion, so I guess you can try any of those points. I would hold back to the fourth line.]
;W[dm]C[JTron [12k\]: :-/
JTron [12k\]: lol
Uelf [9k?\]: i think i still loose anyway :(

T: Invasion still possible];B[ip]C[T: good!];W[ho];B[io];W[di]
;B[im]C[Black goes into the center to try to separate White's stones on the left and right.

T: yes, good idea as well];W[hm]LB[hl:A]C[T: black wants to go into the left side as much as possible, so maybe A is a good idea]
(;B[il];W[hl];B[jj]LB[hk:A][nm:B]C[Black 76 connects the top and bottom.  White has potentially a large territory on the left, and Black wants to reduce some of it.  Black will use center influence to reduce or invade.

T: generally, you dont need to connect (or separate) living groups. It would be a better idea to hane at the head of two white stones with A or separate w groups on the right with B.]
;W[kl]LB[mn:A]TR[lk]C[T: the shape white made here has a weakness and the pourpose of his move is not clear to me. Still you can try killing the bottom with  something like A.]
;B[hn]C[T: ouch, this move is gote and doesnt bring any benefit.]
;W[gn];B[in];W[gp];B[gq];W[pn]C[T: w uses sente to strenghten]
;B[qn];W[po];B[qo];W[rl]LB[fh:C][op:A][oq:B][pq:D]C[T: A is an important point for w, it improves his shape and forces black D. It is said that your opponents key point is your key point, so you can play A locally. B also feels good, it closes the corner a little more. A play round C is big]
(;B[fp];W[go];B[ql];W[qk];B[rm]LB[qp:A]C[T: this is endgame. The left is far bigger. Besides, you taka a liberty of yours and may have to wory about the cut at A if w strenghtens a little in the middle.]
;W[sl];B[sm];W[rj];B[sj];W[rk];B[ph];W[oi];B[np]LB[op:C][nq:A]
[oq:B]C[Perhaps A would be better.  Here and in the moves that follow, Black was thinking of being more aggressive, and started a fight with White's stone.  Black loses this fight.  There is a time for aggression, and perhaps this is not it.  The sequence that follows loses Black the game for sure.

T: B still feels good for b (after removing liberties of the R5 group I dont feel comfortable with C any more)]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[no]LB[op:A]C[T: The connection at A is a must]
;B[nr]LB[op:B][or:A]C[Other possible responses that would likely make Black more secure include A and B.  A treats the atari stone lightly and the corner is secure in one additional move.  This diagonal play seems unreasonable, but black is pushing his aggressive play.  This continuation will cost Black 25 or so points.]
;W[op]LB[pq:A]C[T: still not a disaster if you connect at A. You are 12k, I am sure you can see a double atari ;)) Everyone can read one move ahead - most of the time. Of course, mistakes just happen.]
;B[mq];W[pq]C[Now Black's group on the lower-right looks very weak indeed.  Black uses a strategy of mutual damage, but comes out in a much weaker position than White.

T: The problem is, that your stones get cut.];B[np];W[qp];B[rp]
;W[rq];B[lp]C[Black abandons his weak group.];W[nq]LB[or:A]
C[T: you have gone so far, you can try to play this ko. Even if you dont trust yourself to that, it is safe to connect at A. Saving that stone is worth 5 points at least.]
(;B[lr];W[or];B[mo];W[ro];B[nn];W[pl]C[JTron [12k\]: I've been trying to play much less "safe" lately...and I think it's backfired on me right about now in this game. :)]
;B[np]C[JTron [12k\]: But that's how you learn, I guess.];W[oo]
;B[oq];W[pr];B[nq];W[sp]LB[pm:A]C[The sequence ends.  Black has complicated things, but more for himself than for White.  There is some potential aji at A, but exploiting it seems difficult if not impossible.]
;B[hj];W[hk];B[ik]
(;W[ih]C[Uelf [9k?\]: i like j12 somehow

T: J12 is bad, w should hane to make the most of the left.]
;B[ii];W[hh];B[gj]C[T: good!];W[fl];B[ej];W[dj];B[ln]LB[nm:A]
TR[hb][ek]C[I believe Black A would have done the same job and been stronger, but may have had weaknesses of its own.

T: We are in endgame already, sente is important. H18 is a nice sente move for both sides (w threatens to jump into your corner, you threaten to G15 and either cut of w group or destroy some points at least). It is important to play such moves a soon as the endgame starts, which is said to be when the status of all the groups on the board is clear. Also E9 is a nice sente.]

;B[sg];W[se];B[si]LB[ag:C][rg:B][rh:A][cr:D]C[This was a mistake, Black should have played at A instead. Later White plays B and takes a few extra points (Black loses at least four points here). This obviously was not the biggest mistake, but if Black had played well in the lower-right, this mistake still could have lost Black the game.

T: yes, why not use your nice sente at C instead? :) Also the hane and connection at D has a nice follow up, so its almost sente.]

;B[hi];W[rg]LB[qh:A]C[The failure to protect comes back into play here, where a white cut at A would be even worse.  Black takes his medicine.]
;B[qh];W[sh];B[rh];W[sg];B[od]C[T: And, this move is unnecessary too. -1 point again. I believe this is part of what what was meant by "playing too safe". O course, if you cannot read what happens after a cut, it may be better to play and unnecessary move, especially in bjojomi ;)]
;W[gk]C[T: this should have been your sente too];B[fo];W[dl]
C[T:];B[tt]TR[od][mf][pf]SQ[ed][me][dq][lr]C[T: In this game I see three things that caused your loss, first was failing to reduce white left side soon enough - but that is very difficult to judge; second was not deviding the two white groups in your moyo on the right and third was of course the sad oveplay in the lower right. Else you played very well. 

I pointed out a few more issues (no special order):
1) Playing unnecessary moves (such as the triangled ones were). That is actually a matter of reading. Your reading is sure to improve with the number of games you play (of course you can help it a lot by solving problems).
2) Keeping sente in the endgame. Just try it. This, too, is sure to improve with practice.
3) There is no point in connecting living group, just as there always is a point in separating groups, which dont have eyes yet.
4) If you want to attack a stone, DONT use a contact move like the attachment underneath or O4. Contact moves are good, if you need to strenghten quickly and dont mind that your opponent strenghtens too. 
5) a four space hight extension is not connected

Concerning your question about playing too safe, this would probably fit to moves like the squared ones, protecting cuts that dont exist or arent dangerous. It also could mean that you should attack more and invade more. That is difficult. You might want to read one of the many books on attacking, that would tell you more than I can.

Well, this review got pretty long, I hope it will be useful too :) Have a nice day and enjoy go!]
