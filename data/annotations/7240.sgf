C[pitabread - Hi and thanks in advance for your help.  This is my username on IGS and KGS. This was a live game transcribed. I'm most concerned about fuseki, and middle game variants.  Often my moves felt slow, and it feels like I overplayed, and since my opponent didn't punish too much, it was balanced.  So tempo of moves is also a concern.]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[pp];W[cq];B[dp];W[dq];B[eq]LB[ep:A]C[

R:This i'm quite shure is overplay, the cut is severe]
(;W[er]C[R:This is lacking in spirit, its natural to go for low position when playing 3-3 but not this low]
;B[fq];W[bo];B[fr];W[ds]C[pita -What would be a better way to handle this with 3-3?]
;B[jp];W[qj];B[nc];W[ld]C[pita- I really felt like using this high pincer, but I don't know if it was appropriate in this situation.  I really flubbed up on the joseki, it's about the only star point joseki I am not too familiar with and it became embarassing.]

(;W[jc]LB[pb:A][fc:B]C[Tis felt wrong, maybe N15?
Personally i would prefer treating this stone lightly, and playing A in order to secure points, you then have a very nice position in the right, or you van move against the corner with B]
;B[kc];W[kd];B[jd]C[This cut is quite painful, i dont know how to play against it, you should use you pincer stone for influence and attack, the black group is almost secure]
;W[id];B[je];W[kb];B[lc];W[ic];B[lf];W[fc];B[cf];W[ch]LB[qn:A]
C[pita- Playable?
Playable, but not really large, you are not intrested in this direction, there are not many points for you to be made here, Plaing A here seems like the crucial point, if black playes somewhere here your stones in the corner are much weaker, if you play here they gain strength to compensate for you loss at the top.]

This is quite overplay yes, Your group will struggle for survival]
;B[jr]C[pita -maybe this was a bit of a generous response];W[qq]
C[Going in here is wrong, you get a low position and black has immense power over the center]

;B[jh]C[The game is fairly mainly decided in the middle game, Black has a lot of outward influence and terretory wich makes it hard to catch up]

(;W[nm]TR[mn]C[Black has a hard fight infront of him. The stone is only worth 3 points or so and is not important, this is a very important concept in go and seprates the higher kyu from the lower kyu. Seeing which stones are important and which are not, this stone is not important it serves no function]
