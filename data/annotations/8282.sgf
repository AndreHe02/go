AB[ij][kj]C[First of all, I'd like to have some review on how I kept in style with the handicap placement and the opening.

** Comments are in the game at later points.  I think that the attack of the upper left corner and of the weak bottom group could probably have taken better advantage of the center stones.  Overall, I think white left you a lot of opportunities, and you mostly took advantage of them.  The loss on the left was big, but you already had such a lead that it was ok.  It wasn't until the next group died that it was game over.  I think you played well with big mistakes near the end that cost you the game.]
PL[W];W[oe]C[** This seems really high by white.  It should be easy for black to invade, and the thickness white gains on the outside won't be worth as much due to the center influence black already has.]
;B[fc]C[** Ok, so everyone is doing strange corners.  I don't any joseki for these corner openings, so I can't comment too much on them.  I'm not sure if the center stones by themselves are enough to make me choose these corner styles.]
;W[co];B[op];W[dc];B[ce]C[Did I perhaps mischoose this move? What would be the alternatives?

** I probably would have chosen D16.  C15 feels like it allows white to come out between your two stones.  The natural wall that you'd form by playing D16 seems to work well with your existing center stones.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[de]C[** this seems like really bad shape for white.  In the coming moves, the whole area seems to fall apart.  I probably would have done E14 instead]
;B[cd];W[fe];B[cc]C[** I didn't fully appreciate this move at first, but when I think about it, I really like it.  Black can connect at D18, and white really doesn't have the time to block it.  White really doesn't seem to have much of a follow-up in the area.]
;W[ge];B[hd];W[he];B[id];W[dg];B[ep];W[dq];B[eq];W[dr];B[iq]
;W[gq];B[gp]C[What about this move? Do I have another choice if I want to maintain influence?

** Seems reasonable enough, white G3 seems like an overplay at this stage of the game.]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[fp];B[fq];W[go];B[gr];W[eo];B[gp]C[** I wonder a bit if this fight is big enough given other areas of the board.  Maybe play D4 or a move along the right side instead?  I would be tempted by K5, but your shape feels to weak.]
;W[fo];B[ho]C[** With the available ko for the connection, I don't particularly like this move.  The cut really isn't big enough.  I still like something along the lines of K5 in the area.  Limiting white's access is sure to lead to profit.]

;W[jm];B[dp];W[do];B[cp];W[el];B[gq];W[gk];B[hk];W[gj];B[cj]
C[** I think white needs to play C8 here to ensure the stability of their group.  They're ending up with way too many weak groups on the board.  The whole left side really feels like a disaster for white.]

;W[ef];B[mj];W[mn];B[lm];W[mp]C[How did I deal in the process of the long attack on the white center group?

** Overall, I think you did pretty well.  While I'm not completely sure of the timing, I think you could have blocked white's extension to the top of the board.  Forcing white to make life should give you sente and thickness for attacking the upper right stone.]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[no];W[np];B[oq];W[nn];B[oo];W[mo];B[pm];W[nl]
C[** Here, I was thinking black P10 might be effective.  even if white kills those two stones, they may only have one eye.  They still need to play at K4 as well.  If they get K4 and you enclose at Q9 or something, it's still a huge gain for you that you should be happy with.]
;B[lk];W[ok]C[** P11 by black seems like a candidate here, but it looks like it gets much messier than P10 earlier.]
;B[qk];W[oi];B[gl];W[em];B[og]C[Was this a mistake?

** I'm not sure];W[qj];B[pk];W[pj];B[qg];W[qd];B[nj];W[oj];B[rh]
;W[rk];B[rl];W[rj]C[** N13 here looks very harsh on white.]
;B[om]C[** Either this or L8 was a mistake, but white gets sente from this exchange.]
;W[ml];B[kl];W[ng];B[nh];W[oh];B[pg]C[** I think this is an overplay.  White should be able to paly O14 and kill your stones.  I haven't read it out enough, but black almost certainly needs to form two eyes in a small space.  White can attack O12 to escape, or possibly just win a semeai outright.]

** Yeah, with the big loss on the left, it feels like black should not win.  It looks like black should be ahead, provided that J11 gets covered...]
