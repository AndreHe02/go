C[Dear DigiDko,

Hi! I will be your reviewer for this particular game. I am unclear who is who in the game because the names are different, but from your comments in later moves I assume you were playing black and will focus on looking at black but will put in some also for white where applicable.

Cheers

-DrK];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]C[(DrK) Not my style but this is a solid opening move and balanced (with some on line Q and line R. When one plays like this you will need to be prepared to be approached and invaded.]

(;B[mo]LB[jb:C][nq:A][mr:B]C[I was thinking about playing A, B or C. But I was affreid of the white group in the middle. So I played this.

(DrK) Out of A, B, & C, and the move you actually played, I preferred your actual move. The move attacks white and has some potential to make territory at bottom right corner. A & B are both too mild. White can respond with M2 and seal off bottom side easily. C protects the cutting point H16 but a bit clumsy - white can respond with L18 or K17.

I prefer something else myself - see variations.];W[nq];B[md]

Yes if your objective is to defend the corner it is not effective.

(DrK) Agree. It's mainly dame points and ones white needs to fill in (e.g. O2). Some are wrong though I agree white should not have played.

However, you should not have passed until you played T3 and T1 this is worth one point (white has to play O2 to defend).]

[bo][no][oo][po][so][ap][rp][aq][ar][br][as]C[(DrK) Conclusion:

In my opinion you can work on the following:

1. Identify cutting opportunities and to defend dangerous cuts. H16 is the one I was most concerned with. Should not have stayed disconnected. Also move 18 is pretty urgent.
2. Identify how to reduce centre territory. See especially move 74.

I think I should emphasise that unless you have good reason, it is important to fix your own position before attacking opponent's. Keep groups connected if possible. Ensure there is enough eye space (I was especially thinking about top left black group here).

I suggest that you keep playing and learn to read deeply (we can all improve on this all the time) Do you do Tsumego? If so some reading problems especailly for middle game attacking and defending I think will help you especially.

Hope you enjoy the review! Please let me know if you have query.

Cheers
