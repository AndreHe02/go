C[Hi, 
My name is Slava Kozin (zloy, 12-15k). I will review your game using CGoban  v.2.6.12.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]
(;B[pj];W[dj];B[jd]
(;W[jo]C[This is a bad move. It is not a threat for Black, and it does not make any territory.]
;B[jj];W[on];B[op]C[Not sure how I should have responded to W's knight's approach. Was there a better way?

It was not a really good attack, so I think it is OK.];W[np]

(;B[pn]C[Looking to solidify corner.];W[oo];B[po]C[Now, Black is overconcentrated]
;W[or]
(;B[pr]C[Unsure if this was the best response. It now limited more of my possible territory.

I would cut here...];W[oq]
(;B[os]C[It is a mistake...];W[ns];B[ps];W[pq]C[Probably should have closed q3 sooner instead of doing hane in p1.]
;B[qq]
(;W[nq];B[qr];W[pm];B[qm];W[ol]C[Trying to think of how best to link-up with q10.

You do not need connect. You can make a profit at defferent places... Also, White got a big moyo at the bottom. You have to think about it as well]

(;B[pk];W[pl];B[ql];W[pg]C[Invasion. Unsure of best response.

the best responce is to push White and make territories at the same time]

(;B[og]C[Drive W toward the edge?];W[oh]
(;B[of]C[Now trying to link to q16.

It is a wrong direction from my point of view..];W[pi];B[qi]
;W[oj]
(;B[qk]C[Fortifying q09 and q10.

it is too solid... Black is overconcentrated... I would play somevere else or at least push white...]
;W[ok];B[mh];W[qh]
(;B[ri]C[too small... 

the White bottom is becoming bigger...];W[rh]
(;B[sh]C[I play hane at the edge a lot in a bid to reduce my opponents' territories. Does this make much sense of should I really just close the wall?

You do not need to plat at this part of the board at all... it is too small]
;W[sg];B[si]C[Now, you closed the wall];W[qg]
(;B[rj]C[Playing it safe with one eye. I felt my wall still had many weaknesses.

This move is a pass... Too small...];W[ng]C[Here, should I have played B-012 after this move?]

(;B[nf]C[I think I was still trying to solidify my upper right.]
;W[mg]C[W is now cutting into my middle territory. How best to limit his encroachment?

Do not touch stones of your opponent. Make a knight moves.]

(;B[lh];W[mf]
(;B[mj]C[Now trying to build two separate territories around m10 and q16.]
;W[mi];B[ni];W[oi]C[W-p11 surprised me. My opponent didn't seem the sort to give me a stone. What were his concerns that he had to play there? I can't visualize the threat.

Probably, White madea mistake, but, anyway, this stone is too small...There is still a big fish...]
;B[li]C[Took it. Maybe B-m10 would have been a better move?

It was too small... You wasted your move again...];W[ne];B[oe]
;W[md]C[Swell. W is now driving between k16 and q16. I was now thinking of a way to create two living groups.]
;B[nc];W[lg]
(;B[kg];W[kf];B[le]C[Overlooked weakness at l12. W will exploit in the next move.]
;W[kh];B[jg];W[ki]
(;B[jh];W[kj];B[kk];W[lj]C[Unexpected situation. Didn't think W would place stones under threat of capture.]
;B[lk];W[nj];B[ji];W[nh];B[mi]C[again, too small];W[kd]C[May need to give up on m15. Would it have been worthwhile to save it? If so, how?

You do not need to save this stone. You have more important places to play. I showed some of them.]

(;B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[ld]
(;B[lc]C[it is a bad idea to touch opponents stones in this situation.]

(;W[kc];B[nd];W[me];B[mc]
(;W[jc];B[ic];W[jb];B[ib]
(;W[ia]C[White should have attacked the P15 group insted or protected territories]
;B[ha];W[ja];B[hb];W[lb];B[mb];W[ma];B[na];W[la];B[nb]C[again, this move is a "thank you" move for the white. It is almost pass. It is a mistake.]
;W[id];B[hd];W[ie];B[hf]
(;W[pf];B[pe];W[qe];B[qd];W[re];B[rd];W[sd];B[sc];W[se]
(;B[rc];W[qb]C[Uh-oh. What's the best way to handle THAT?

Just play carefully...];B[pb];W[oc];B[pc];W[ob];B[oa];W[qp]

(;B[pa]C[I think I should have played B-r6 instead.

Yes.];W[qn];B[qo]C[It is a mistake...];W[ro]C[Okay, I lost those. Now, how can I make thr group in the bottom right live?

I do not see any ways to live, if  White will not make any mistakes.  It is too later.]
;B[rq];W[rp];B[sq];W[rs]C[I just lost the group.];B[sk];W[rm]
;B[rl];W[sm]
(;B[sl]C[Okay, those are now alive.

This was overplayed... You do not need to make this move];W[gf]
;B[he];W[gc]
(;B[if]C[I wanted to eliminate those stones but maybe I took them too early. Where else should I have played?

White has almost won the game. You have to destroy white's moyos to win.]
;W[hc]
(;B[id]C[You do not need this move right now... Your group is alive... I showed some variations.]
;W[gd];B[gh];W[hk]
(;B[hj];W[gj]
(;B[hi];W[hg];B[gg];W[gi]
(;B[hh];W[fg]
(;B[ig]C[you are playing too passively... You have to push your opponent...]
;W[ff];B[fh];W[fi];B[eh]C[Trying to push deeper into W's territory. I have NO idea as to what I'd eventually do but I was thinking that I might be able to use it to stage something.

You should have started to push earlier in the game.];W[mk]
;B[ml];W[nk];B[mm];W[ll]
(;B[lm];W[kl];B[jm];W[kn];B[km];W[il];B[jl];W[ik]C[Just ignore this move... you will lost point or two, but you can gain many more points playing at different places...Look at the whole board, not only at the local fighting..]
;B[ij];W[jk]C[Again, ignore these kinds of moves]
(;B[kl];W[gk]
(;B[jn]C[Now trying to push towards the lower-left and prepare for an invasion in the bottom.

Actually, you are helping white to build a wall];W[ko];B[hn]
;W[in];B[kj]C[W told me that this was a wasted move. I guess it was but my inexperience suggested that it might be a vulnerability. This move probably cost me my invasion plans for the lower part of the board.

It was like a pass move.];W[im];B[lo]C[Zero9090: why did you go to L10]
;W[ln];B[mn];W[mo]C[ChiyoDad: Not sure that I could create a living group of m7, so I had to connect .]

(;B[lp]C[ChiyoDad: I only had one eye.];W[kq];B[dh]C[This extension, coupled with an attack to d16 might give me what I need to build territory]
;W[lq]C[I'm giving up on m5 and m4.

They were already dead];B[de];W[ee];B[df];W[eg];B[dg];W[ef]

(;B[bi]C[You missed a good cut.];W[ci]
(;B[ch]C[You do not need to connect now.];W[bj];B[bg];W[ai]
;B[bh];W[aj];B[cd];W[cc]
(;B[dc];W[ed];B[cb];W[bc];B[db];W[ce]C[How should I have responded to this cutting stone?]

;B[ca];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[ea]C[I think W was being charitable here. Was there wa way that he could have kept me from forming two eyes? What should I have been watching out for?

I think that you have two eyes or connection with the H19 group]
;W[fa]
(;B[ip]C[The next sequence of stones is my attempt to build a base at the bottom of the board. I don't think that I played them right and I'd like to know what would have been a better approach.

White has a pretty solid wall there. So, you need to live inside. I would start in the corner.]
;W[io];B[hp];W[ho]
(;B[go]C[Live there is very hard for black.];W[gn];B[jq];W[jp]
;B[iq];W[fo];B[gp];W[gr]C[That really limist my territory now. I have to focus on just making the group live.]
;B[gq];W[fq];B[fr];W[er];B[hr];W[fs]C[This is where my group begins to die. Was there some other way I could have saved it?]
;B[hs];W[jr];B[kr];W[ks];B[js];W[is];B[fn];W[hm];B[fp];W[sp]
;B[eo]C[Okay, maybe I can still save all of those stones except l2. Did W miss an opportunity here?

Yes, white made a mistake];W[fm];B[en];W[ep];B[do];W[gs];B[ir]
;W[lr];B[cp]C[I'm desparately fighting to escape and keep my stones alive. I don't know if this is the right sequence. It was the best I could come up with with W pursuing me all the way.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[dq];B[bo];W[cq]
(;B[bp];W[bq]
(;B[bn];W[dm];B[dn]C[I did it??

Yes, you did it because of the white's mistake];W[em]
(;B[fo]C[You do not need it now...];W[cm];B[aq];W[ar];B[ap]
;W[br];B[bm];W[bl];B[al];W[ak];B[am];W[ck];B[ge];W[fe];B[ag]

1. Look at the whole board
2. Push your opponent from the beginning of the game
3. Do not waste your moves, play lighter, not too solid
4. You do not haveto answer on every move of your opponent
5. You do not have to save every your stone on the board

Hope, it was useful. Thank you and Good Luck!])
