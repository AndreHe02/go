C[Dear reviewer,

I played this with W on KGS. Guess I lost the game in the opening by allowing B to build a huge and almost impenetrable moyo. Still I managed to make some territory of my own, then to implant a living group into his moyo. He in return did likewise to me. My last effort to turn the game around was nicely met by B saving himself into double Ko.

At every stage of the game, I found and pointed out some obvious (?) errors of my own. Wonder what you have to say, both to the overall strategy and to the technical details.

Thank you very much for reviewing this !];B[qd]C[mymoyo [5k\]: gg]
