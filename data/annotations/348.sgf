C[a reasonable move. consistent with the stone at c15 in the upper left. black is laying claim to the left side. however, looking at the top vs the left side, which is bigger? the top is bigger, 13 lines between stones. the left is not as big, only 10 lines. so, the conclusion is, while c6 is playable, maybe something around d17, l17, or p17 is bigger.]
;W[dc]C[also a reasonable move. the top is the biggest area now. and approaching a corner is best in this situation.]
;B[ed]C[ok. black will build thickness and give w profit at the top. black should use thickness to build structure on left side.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[gb]C[w g18 deviates from joseki. g17 is the normal move, and sometimes f17 is seen.]
;B[fq]C[black goes astray. black needs a move around d10 to complete left side.]
;W[eo];B[cq]C[locally, the best move. but inconsistent with the thickness at the top. should be developing the left side instead. goes back to f3 error.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do]C[w d5 is bad shape. it creates the empty triangle.];B
[dm]C[not sure about this move. maybe d6 would have been better.];W[cr]
;B[bq]C[another empty triangle. bad shape!];W[gp]C[naturally, w needs to capture f3 stone and make a base on the bottom.]
;B[jq]C[what is b trying to accomplish here? b is neglecting the left side. a move on the left is more important now. if you want to play at the bottom, e.g. harass the w group, threaten to save the f3 stone, etc. play h3.]
;W[hq]C[w plays h3, the vital point.];B[nq];W[lq];B[no];W[qn]C[
 sakul 11k*: undo?];B[kp]C[this is a reasonable sequence for the bottom side.

 albert 10k : yes
 sakul 11k*: you must undo first
 albert 10k : undo O11
 albert 10k : thx
 sakul 11k*: sure];W[mo]C[what is w trying to accomplish here? the w stone at m3 is captured. forget it. there are bigger and more urgent areas to play now. the left side is urgent. a corner enclosure/approach around p17 is also big.]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[lo];W[ko];B[mn];W[kq];B[jp];W[ln];B[mo];W[kn]C[a waste of moves for both sides. w failed in rescuing his m3 stones, and created a weak group in the process, at l6.]
;B[io]C[good attacking move. split w weak group from his strong group.]
;W[di]C[yes! about time!];B[dj]C[b error: contacting a weak stone. never contact a weak stone. attack it from afar. d9 maybe better.touching the weak stone only makes it stronger. this is to w's advantage.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[cg];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[ck];B[cl];W[bl];B[bm];W[bk];B[dg]
;W[bg];B[dh];W[ch];B[ei]C[ok, b got some thickness out of the deal. not so bad.]
;W[ci];B[fj]C[maybe a little too defensive. i think pressing the attack against the w weak group at l6 is better. maybe around m8 to enclose w and push him towards b thick wall on the left.]
;W[jc]C[i question this move by w. the center is big and urgent. the w group in the upper left is fairly safe, so it doesnt need help. maybe a move at p17 if you need to play at the top.]
;B[oc]C[locally correct, but globally misses the mark. the center is urgent.]
;W[kk]C[ right! w flees. naturally.];B[jd]C[b again errors by making inappropriate contact plays. better for b would be k15. contacting at k16 allows w to do an end run around k16 and penetrate the center. if b caps at k15, it is harder for w to get into the center from the top, and k15 has attacking influence on the w center group.]
;W[id];B[je];W[ie]C[see? w is penetrating the center.];B[kc];W[jb];B[ld]
C[locally good, thick shape.];W[qi]C[a very big move. w has a fairly good sense of the important strategical areas. i would argue that a move on the 4th line would be better as it reaches out to the w group in the center.]
;B[qk]C[a provocative move. b invades. maybe a 4th or 5th line move would be better. i.e. reduce from a high position in sente and turn to attack the center.]
;W[qf]C[ naturally, w needs a base on the side.];B[qh]C[there goes b again. contact, contact, contact. sometimes contact is appropriate, but here i doubt it. i would rather press at q10 instead. help the r9 stone to escape, and build thickness toward center.]
;W[ph];B[rh];W[ri];B[rf];W[pk];B[pg];W[oh];B[og];W[nh];B[ng]C[a trade. who gets more? b maybe getting about 16 pts here. if w eats the r9 stone, w maybe getting about the same amount of territory. the difference is the reaching toward the center and rescuing the weak w center group. w does better after all.]
;W[jf];B[kf];W[ke];B[kd];W[kg];B[lf];W[ig]C[now it is w who is building center thickness. let's see what happens in the center later. will there be a battle? will groups die?]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[rr];B[pj]C[maybe better to hane on the other side at q8 instead.]
;W[pi];B[pl];W[ok]C[
 sakul 11k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[qm]C[interesting. maybe b will rescue the r9 stone after all.]

;B[jo]C[this is the biggest mistake of the game. b puts himself in atari while trying to atari w.]
;W[jr]C[resign time.];C[over all i think w played fairly well, but feel that b made repeated mistakes both tactically and strategically that gave w the game. b should concentrate on what he wants in the opening. dont try to get too much. over reaching results in getting less than your share. try to be consistent with your opening... if you build thick wall, try  to extend on the side to build a large framework. if a eak group is on the board, attack it. play in the biggest area, the most developable area. dont play contact moves (fighting moves) if you want to attack. attack from afar, not with contact moves. last but not least, watch your liberties.-)]
