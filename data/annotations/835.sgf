C[I played Black and was playing much stronger than I normally do. I have questions about the game within the file but would love to hear any overall advice you might have.

Comments:

Overall, I found the game to be very interesting, with both sides having opportunities to win the game until the end.

Both you and your opponent missed a number of important tactical opportunities in this game.  If you want to raise the level of your game as quickly as possible, I urge you to do as many tesuji and life-and-death problems as you can.]
;B[pp]C[As you will see, I have included numerous comments and variations.  Please don't accept them at face value.  I invite you to work through them and arrive at your own conclusions.]
;W[dp];B[qd];W[cc]C[Black to move:

The biggest move on the board here is to close the upper right hand corner at P17.  (O17 or even P16 are possible alternatives.)]
;B[jq]C[Black K3:

There is no question that this is a big move.  However, closing the upper right corner at P17 is bigger.]
;W[oc]C[Black to move:

Here, the correct move is to pincer the White approach stone by playing at L17 or M16.  Other pincers are playable.

As a general rule, when your opponent makes a low approach to your 3-4 stone, it is right to pincer in the majority of cases.]
;B[pc]C[Black Q17:

There is a go proverb, "Do not contact a weak stone."  The reason is that you are helping your opponent get stronger.

This attachment would be a good move if Black already had a stone at, say, M16, because then White would not be able to make efficient use of his stones.  However, where White is able to make a full extension, the diagonal contact play is a "thank you" move.]
;W[od]C[Black to move:

The exchange of the Q17 and P17 stones has given Black a firm grip of the corner.  However, White has built outside strength.  In general, this type of exchange favors White.

Given that Black has played the attachment at Q17, Black must now help the two corner stones by playing Q14 or R14 to keep them from getting shut in.]

(;B[pj]C[Black Q10:

This move is a nice-looking extension from the Black stone at Q4.  However, White has an opportunity now to play at R15, sealing Black in.  This would be a very bad result for Black.  (See variation.)]

(;W[pg]C[Black to play:

Here, it feels natural to approach the upper left corner at F16.]

(;B[nj]C[Black O10:

This move feels a little slow, but it is helping Black to build up influence in the lower right, and may later help Black to put pressure on the White stones in the upper right.]
;W[dj]
(;B[jd]C[Black K16:

This move is the right idea, as the upper side is a very big area.  But you might think about playing at F16 first, followed by K17.  This would give Black a base while putting some pressure on the upper right.  (See variation.)]
;W[ed];B[fq]C[Black F3:

A big move.  Black is developing an intimidating moyo.];W[dn]
C[Black to play:

Another go proverb:  "Increase your own potential before you reduce your opponent's."

Here, you might think about building your moyo by playing at G6.]

(;B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[ec]C[Black to play:

The critical point right now for both players is M17.  If Black gets to play there first, he can launch a severe attack on the three White stones.  If White plays there first, he will obtain a secure base.

Black here can treat his F17 as a "light" stone (that is, a stone that can be given up), and simply play at M17 right now.  This would give Black an immediate big advantage.  (See variation.)]

(;B[gc];W[ff]C[Black to play:

Again, Black should play at M17.]
(;B[gf];W[gg];B[hf];W[fh];B[hg];W[hh];B[ih];W[hi];B[ii];W[lc]
C[Black to play:

When White takes this vital point, it looks like he should be able to live fairly easily, so Black should not go all out and try to attack this group.  Instead, Black should take a look at the rest of the board.

The key feature here is White's huge left side, and Black's moyo on the lower right.  The question here is a difficult one.  Should Black reduce White and build up his moyo?  Or should Black make a deep invasion into the White territory?

Before doing either, Black should exchange L17 for M16.  This gives Black a secure base for his stones in the upper left, and reduces White's eye space in sente.]

(;B[le];W[md];B[me];W[ne];B[ld];W[mb];B[nf];W[of];B[ng];W[pd]
;B[qc];W[nq];B[oq];W[lq]C[His L3 & N3 will
eventually grow into a huge mass. Could I have stopped him?

Comment:

The object of the game is to take more territory, not to kill stones.  The reason that the white stones grow into such a troublesome mass is that you are trying too hard to kill them.

Rather than trying to kill them, you would do better just to lock up as much territory as you can, in sente, and then invade on the left side.  You should win comfortably if you do that.

The trouble with trying to hard to kill a group that can't be killed is that you ruin your own territories, and leave weaknesses that can be punished in a counterattack.  You will see later that White missed an opportunity to win the game outright.]
;B[jo]C[Black K5:

I like this move because it helps your left side while attacking.]
;W[lo];B[np];W[mp];B[nr];W[mq];B[no];W[mo]C[Black to play:

Up to here, I think you are doing very well.  But don't try too hard to kill the white stones!

Here is one plan:  Lock up territory on the lower right by pushing the White group around.  You should also be able to develop some central influence.  At the right moment, reduce or invade the left side, and you should win.  (See variations.)]

(;B[km]C[Black L7:

This is the wrong direction, because it leads to damage on your right side.]
;W[mm];B[nm]C[Black O7:

Playing at P7 would have been safer.];W[nl];B[om];W[ll]C[Black to play:

Here, you might just play at P8.];B[lm];W[mn];B[mk];W[ml];B[kk]
;W[nn];B[on];W[ol];B[pl];W[pk]C[White Q9:

Black is now is a bit of trouble on the right side.];B[qk]C[White to play:

Instead of connecting at P9, White has a great opportunity here.  Do you see it?

(See variation.)]
(;W[ok];B[qm];W[oj];B[oi];W[pi];B[qj];W[ni];B[oh];W[mj];B[mi]
;W[nk];B[lk];W[lj];B[nh];W[nj]C[At this point, I really didn't think his stones would live, but he got two eyes. Was it wrong of me to think I could kill these stones?

Comment:

The White group cannot be killed because White can make two eyes by playing at L4, forcing black to connect, and then playing at N2.]
;B[ki];W[li];B[mh];W[lh];B[lg];W[kh];B[ji];W[kj]C[Would K8 have been a better move here? If not, where?

Comment:

K9 is correct.  (See variation.)]
(;B[jj];W[kl]C[I sacrificed the three stones at L9 thinking I could stop him from getting two eyes.

Comment:

Sacrificing the three stones gives White a guaranteed eye at N9.  White can make a second eye by playing at either L4 or N2.]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[ik];W[kk]C[White L9:

Unnecessary.];B[im];W[mr];B[ns];W[ms];B[pr];W[kr];B[kq];W[jr]
;B[ir]C[Could I have played this sequence in such a way as to stop him from making two eyes?

Comment:

White has been alive for some time now.  (See above analysis.)]
;W[js];B[is];W[ls]C[White M1:

Unnecessary.];B[ph];W[qh];B[qi];W[rh]C[Black to play:

Are you sure the three stones in the upper right corner are alive?]
;B[ri]C[Black S11:

White can now kill the corner by playing at S15.  (See variation.)]

(;W[qf]C[Black to play:

White has given Black another chance -- it is now critical to help the corner.

After saving the upper right corner, the next biggest move is reducing or invading the left side.]
;B[jg];W[kg];B[kf];W[fn];B[gn];W[gm];B[fm]C[Black F7:

This crosscut is an overplay.  White can punish it simply by extending at G8.  (See variation.)]

(;W[go];B[hn];W[fo];B[fl]C[White to play:

Here, White is threatening a cut at J3.  (See variation.)  However, of course, White should simply kill the upper right corner.  After that, the next biggest move would be closing the lower left corner by playing at D2.]

(;W[hl];B[hk];W[dl]C[Could I have played at C3 and taken more of the corner?

Comment:

C3 would have been bigger.  (See variation.)]
(;B[dq];W[cq]
(;B[dr]
(;W[cp]C[Black to play:

Locally, Black can take away a lot of territory by playing at B2.  However, of course, saving the upper right corner and protecting the cutting point at J3 are more important.]

(;B[hj];W[fj];B[gi];W[gh];B[fi]C[Black F11:

This is an overplay.  White can capture the two black stones by cutting at G10.  (See variation.)]

;B[ds];W[br];B[qe]C[Black R15:

Good.  Making life here is the biggest move on the board.  (But you should also note that White is threatening to cut at H3.  After you live in the upper right, you have to fix this weakness.)]
;W[pe];B[rf];W[rg];B[sf];W[sg];B[rd]C[Black S16:

Good.  Now Black is alive.];W[pf];B[si];W[pa]C[I should have played P18 here, yes?

Comment:

P18 is an overplay.  Black should just play at Q18.  (See variations.)]

(;B[qa];W[qb];B[rb];W[ra];B[sb]C[At this point, I thought black was alive in the upper right. Keeping this group would have won me the game. Where did I go wrong up here?

Comment:

Black is alive here, at least for the time being.  However, when all the outside liberties are eventually filled in, black must play another move inside.  This is what you did wrong -- you filled in your outside liberties yourself without first fixing your internal weakness.]

Comment:

Actually, your position in the lower left is not completely finished yet.  What happens if White plays atari at H3?]
;B[og]C[Both sides miss the cut at H3.  (See variation.)]
(;W[kn];B[jn];W[ln];B[sh];W[qg];B[jm];W[kp];B[jp];W[ko];B[sa]
C[Black T19:

This move takes away a crucial outside liberty.  White can now start a ko by playing at T17.  (See variation.)

There is no reason for Black to play at T19.  R19 is a false eye for White -- it will never become territory. When White eventually plays at P18, R19, and T19, Black will finally respond at T16.]

(;W[ob];B[qa]C[Black R19:

Now Black is once again alive because of the crucial outside liberty at S19.]

(;W[jh]C[I would have won this game if I had played the upper left better. Yes?

Comment:

I assume you mean upper right.  Right now, the upper right corner is alive.  If you defend your weakness in the lower left, you should win by a couple of points.  However, if you do not see the danger in the lower left and your opponent does, then White will win.  (See variations.)

In any event, playing at S19 is a mistake because it takes away a crucial outside liberty.]

(;B[ra]C[Comment on Black S19:

If you want to play at S19, you must first protect your inside at T16 or T17 because you are short of liberties and have cutting points.]
