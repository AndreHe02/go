C[Hi, I will only point out the strategic mistakes because you could improve  tetsuji on your own. You don't have to agree with all my points. But if you have any questions, you are welcome all the time. I am RdRunner on IGS.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[ep];B[pj];W[jq];B[jd];W[cj];B[mq]C[C15 is probably better. If you want to play at here, M3/O3 is the move.  N3 doesn't secure the corner neither give enough pressure to K3 - and the problem does show up later.]
;W[jj];B[cp]C[Wrong direction: Should have invaded the upper-left corner, or K10 instead  of N3 before. Invading the upper-left corner will receive less pressure and help deciding how to invade this part of the Moyo. C10 and K3 are at lower  position; thus, it is not easy for W to enclose the whold territory using onlt few moves.]
;W[dn];B[dq];W[eq];B[do]C[Conflict of interest: D3 trys to live, D5 trys to escape - W had 4 stones nearby already. No way B can live and break a chunch of territory. Either try to live in corner as big as possible or run as fast as B can. If D3 is  played, C6 is a better move here. Because C10/K3 is low, so B should live then lightly invade the Moyo.]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[dp];B[co];W[cq];B[bq];W[dr];B[br];W[bo];B[bp]
;W[bm];B[go];W[hp];B[fm]C[Strange shape. E6 seems better because C10 is low and too close to C6 wall. Making a wall with narrow expension even stronger - expension seems even  narrower - by playing E6 E7 F7...]
;W[fn];B[en];W[fo];B[gm];W[fp];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm];W[dk];B[fk]
C[E9];W[ek];B[el];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[rj];B[qh]C[S11 is prob better...]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[qi];B[ph]C[Shape is not solid... W have S14 and Q11 now. R13 is a better move. This way,

Q10 is still useable.];W[pi];B[oh];W[oi]C[Q10 is out, W still has S14... B gains nothing here.]
;B[qm]C[What is the purpose of R7? R11 group is unattackable, R3 is still empty. So, R7 doesn't actually do anything for B. But W helped B by trying to live a alive group. R5/S14 would be better. It is useless to attack living group.]

;W[pm];B[pn];W[on];B[po];W[nm];B[fi]C[C17. This group is alive. B C17, if W D16, W's wall here is useless; or W C16

B D16, force W into fighting; or W C18 B C16; once B lives, W doesn't have  enough territory.]
;W[hc];B[he]C[Still, should play C17 - same idea as above.]
;W[jb];B[de];W[cg];B[cc];W[cd];B[dd];W[ce];B[ec];W[db];B[eb]
;W[cb];B[kb];W[ed];B[df]C[F16 then F15, give D16/D15 up - your target is H17 group. The only reason for

keeping D16/D15 is that they'll be useful if you could attack C10 group - which is not the case.]
;W[fd];B[jm]C[F14, D14 is not safe yet - F14 also stop F16 from running into Moyo.]
;W[ff];B[bc];W[bb];B[cf];W[bd];B[gg];W[dg]C[W's corner became too big. If all B wants is G13, should just C17 to take the corner. B lost the game at this moment.]

;B[ne];W[sf];B[tt];W[se]C[B lost after gave a too big upper-left corner to W.   The reason why B lost is that stones are not working together. Later moves  should work with former moves to achieve a goal not running into different  directions. B should carefully examine opponent's and his own intention.  Before playing a secquence or chose a battle field, B should know his own intention and expection.  After the secquence or the local battle, try to balance the check book to see if the goal was achieved or having benefitical exchanges. If check book is not balanced, how and where to make profit. After

all, you win because you have more terriories - not more numbers of dragons. Please try to look at the whole board instead only a part of the board.  Again, if you have any question, you are welcome all the time.]
