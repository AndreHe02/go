C[S.

Hello, my name is Simon. I am a KGS 8k and although white wins this game there are still many mistakes I would like to point out.

However, winning games are not good for reviewing because you won and so you had decent play by default. Next time you submit a review take one where you lose by 40 points even though you played slowly. Those are the games worth reviewing.

Most of my comments are about black but I have some comments for white as well.

You can contact me at simon@thornewill.org if you have any questions about my comments. :)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq]C[S.

So far so good.];B[fc];W[dg]C[S.

This move strikes me as odd. Its not really a punishable mistake but I dont think you'll understand the meaning behind this kind of move.

By playing high instead of low you emphasise whether you want to make points in the corner or though influence on the side.

With this you are saying "I dont care about my corner, take it" I just want the influence to build on the side.

Its not wrong, but you should be aware of what your moves mean.]
;B[dc]C[S.

There is no need for black to attach like this, normally this is only done when black needs to settle his position very quickly. Since he isnt under pressure there are better moves he can play.]

If you want to use this stone for aji you should play ligher than this stompingly slow move]

Black has the right idea but its slow];W[dl]C[S.

Slow, should approach the lower right hand corner];B[fp];W[do]

It will probably be a revolution to your style if you try to jump instead of stomping along]

Good idea but it a bit late];B[kd];W[je]
(;B[kf];W[jf];B[lg];W[nh];B[oi];W[mi];B[jg]C[S.

Even at 17k you can see why having two weak groups on the board is difficult. You cant really help both at once]

Well done

Comments end here skip to the end for my end game analysis

The marked stones end up being in atari but white doesnt capture. I assume he was being nice to black in allowing him to keep his 12 points ;)]

Right, so the biggest reason why white won was because you had 80 points along the left hand side... Black should have invaded there earlier

Also, most of the weak groups you used to invade ended up living so that reduced his bigger moyo substantially.

Sorry I couldnt write a lot of comments but this want a very good game to submit. Normally the games you lose on and are not blitzing are better to submit because then a higher level player can correct your bigger mistakes.]

Not such a great move by black]))

This is how you live];B[sk];W[so];B[sj];W[sl]C[S.

Tip: Do some easy tsumego (life and death problems) on goproblems.com or something equivalent (ChoChikuns life and death problems are quite good too)

It will teach you the basics of life and death and will make you a much stronger player]

Best to secure this group now instead of helping your other weak groups

The group on the bottom should be tended to next, your position isnt good there either]
