RE[W+4.5]

C[My (Black, zwoelefant) strength: 11k* on IGS

I (Black) lost the game with 4.5 points. But I think if I've been a little bit smarter I could have won the game on a big scale. For instance I failed to kill an enormous group I was chasing.
During the game I often didn't know where to play my next move. I've marked the moves and my general question is, if I was at least finding the right points.]

;B[jq];W[ce];B[dj]C[zwoelefant: The first move I considered for a while. I did not know if points around K16 or Q10 are maybe better. Now it seems to me that D10 is correct because it makes a kind of double wing formation. Is this right?

I think it is.  The second best area to play is around K16. For white, K16 would be much better than Q10. K16 works nicely with his shimari. With his stone at R6 on the third line, he cannot expect to make much territory with Q10. Therefore a black move at K16 would be much better than one at Q10, but i believe this move is the right one.]
;W[fq]C[zweolefant: I still think this was a mistake for white. For me D7 seems to be the right point.

It's hard to tell what's the best point, but if white is going to approach the corner stone it is indeed better to do so from the other side because the black stone at D10 is not as strong as the one on K3.]
;B[eq]C[good move.];W[fp];B[dn];W[hq]
(;B[jo]TR[mp][op][nq][jq]C[zwoelefant: This one is maybe better at J4?

Maybe, or J5. With this move the marked stones seem a bit overconcentrated. It's a difficult position.]
;W[ho]
(;B[jm]C[zwoelefant: I didn't think of killing the group, because I think it is not possible (yet).

Maybe J7 is better, but it's still difficult.];W[er];B[dr];W[es]

;W[jr];B[kr];W[iq];B[jp];W[is]
(;B[go]C[zwoelefant: Now the white I had the feeling the white group is killable.

Maybe, but trying to kill a group can be risky and i don't think you need to kill this group to win. See variation.]
;W[fo];B[gn];W[fn];B[em];W[fm];B[gm];W[fl]C[zwoelefant: O.k. the white group has resurrected,  I thought. So I played somewhere else.]
;B[pj]C[zwoelefant: Is this move o.k. or would it have been better to fight with the white group?

I think K16 is better. That move approaches the shimari and it could help if you're going to chase the white group.]

;W[dl]C[zwoelefant: Now at last it should be possible to kill this big white group.]
;B[fj];W[bm]
(;B[bn]C[zwoelefant: My fault. I did not think enough. Now I think C6 is the right point (see the variation).

I agree.];W[en];B[do]C[zwoelefant: I cannot play at D7];W[dm]
;B[cn]C[This move doesn't seem so urgent.];W[ck];B[gk]C[Good. Black is connected and the white stones at J8 and K8 are almost useless.]
;W[mc];B[hc]C[zwoelefant: For this move I had to think a lot. My first thought was to capture the two white stones J8K8 in a latter. But this is clearlt not the right move. But maybe L17 or L18 is better? Another idea is maybe N16?

I think i would play L17 to put pressure on the white stone. Now white can easily make a base.]
;W[jc];B[he];W[je];B[hg];W[jg];B[ih]C[This is a bit too cautious. Black is strong enough here. It's better to something about the upper right corner. Perhaps Q14.]
;W[lg];B[pf];W[no];B[np];W[nm];B[ph]C[zwoelefant: The next move I had to think a lot. This one seems to be very small, but I was afraid of an invasion...

I think it's good. If white invades he can try to link up with M13 or with the corner.]
;W[qi];B[qj]C[zwoelefant: This one did not work very well. Which move would have been better?

It should have worked out well.];W[pi];B[oi];W[qh];B[qg];W[rg]

;W[qm];B[nk];W[nh];B[mi];W[nf];B[kl]C[zwoelefant: I had the feeling this move is important not to lose the groupe around P12. Is this correct, or would it have been better to secure the corner?

It's a solid move, but i don't think it's really necessary right now. So protecting the corner is probably better.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[qe]C[See variation.];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb]
(;B[rd]C[zwoelefant: I thougt this is quite a genius move, but now I certain, that Q18 is correct (see the variation).

Q19 is correct, but it leads to ko.];W[oc];B[rc];W[qb];B[nb]
;W[od];B[pe];W[mb];B[rh];W[sk];B[mg]C[zwoelefant: My next move are neerly randomly. I tried to catch at least one white group on the upper side. But I didn't succeed. What would have been better?

It would have been better to try to read it out to see whether it is possible to capture a few stones and even if it is possible, it may not be the best thing to do. So if you don't see how you can do anything in this area, it is better to play somewhere else and while your opponent is thinking you can try to find a way to do something useful here.
Maybe a reduction move at D14.];W[ng];B[ne];W[me];B[oe];W[nd]
;B[mf];W[mh];B[lf];W[le];B[kf];W[lh];B[li];W[jh]C[zwoelefant: By now I had quite a shock, because I realised, that I have nearly no territory. So I tried to catch the white stones O5 and O6. Now I think it is not possible. Should I have played somewhere else?

It was a nice attempt, but in the end you just helped white with your moves.  In the next sequence you don't achieve that much, but white gains sente.  The idea of cutting of those stones is good, but if it doesn't work it's just helping white.]
;B[pm];W[pn];B[on];W[oo];B[mo];W[om];B[ok];W[fh]C[zwoelefant: Now invading at D13 is impossible

I think black should reduce at F14.];B[gh];W[ff];B[db];W[eb]

;W[ae];B[aa]C[zwoelefant: I got the corner, but in gote and the corner is completely walled in by white. Is there a way to do it better?

I think this turned out quite well for black. White still has a cutting point black can aim at. If white defends that point with his next move black has taken the corner, which was already more or less white's territory,  in sente.]
;W[fd];B[fc];W[ec];B[gd];W[fe];B[fb]C[J18 is better because that move threatens the white territory.]

I think L4 is better. It saves a few points and gives the possibility of atariing the L3 stone.]

[bf][ai][ah][ag][af]C[Close game in the end.
You were ahead in the opening, but when you tried to kill white and failed, white could catch up. due to move 99 at T13 and the failed attempts to capture and cut, white got ahead. Taking the upper left corner was a succes. You generally played a good endgame and when white ignored the threat in the upper right the game was not far from even.

Attacking agressively is risky. It's nice when it works, but if it doesn't you usually loose something, so when you try to kill a goup or capture stones it's important first to read it out. If that's too difficult then most of the time it's better not to try to kill.]
