C[Daedin: Hello. I am Daedin, playing Black in this game against Jahz.
We played in our local Go club, and this is a transcription of the game that was done by Jahz a few days afterwards. We will both add our comments in this file, and point out everything that we feel may be of use to you.

Have fun !];B[dp];W[pc];B[pe];W[qg]
(;B[qc];W[qd];B[pd];W[qe]
(;B[oc]C[Daedin: I made some research afterwards, and it seems this move is one tempo early, since the joseki is as shown in the first variation.]
;W[pb];B[nd];W[rc]
(;B[dd]C[Daedin: Black's position is indeed far less thicker that with the usual joseki.
But instead of Black D16, could he play at R14 to "catch up" with the usual joseki ?]
;W[pp];B[nq]
(;W[qn]C[Jahz: probably not good, W has only one side, but what to do else ?]
;B[jp];W[cn]
(;B[dj]C[Daedin: According to Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, this pincer is rather played when Black has a san-rei-sei at the bottom, and then White enters the corner at C3.]
;W[en];B[fp];W[bp];B[cq];W[bj]C[Daedin: After the game we both felt that this may not have been a very good move, since it is rather played when the Black stone is at D9.]

;W[cb];B[ec];W[cf];B[pg]C[Daedin: Here I wanted to build a wall on the right, but did not consider the simple and obvious answer at Q12.

Jahz: this is not so obvious, as W is then cut];W[ph];B[qf]
;W[rf];B[pf];W[qh];B[rg];W[re];B[rh];W[pi];B[qj];W[nh]C[since B has used the aji at R14, R18 is now a sente move for B.]

(;B[dg]C[Daedin: This may not be the right time, and keeping the pressure on the weak Q12 group might be better.

Jahz: i agree, i was suprised by this move]
(;W[nj]C[Jahz: maybe too slow];B[ol]
(;W[mk];B[on];W[pm];B[oj];W[pj];B[pk];W[oi];B[om];W[ok]C[Daedin: Letting White take the stone is huge, because his group is now pretty much safe.

Yes.];B[pn];W[qm];B[pl];W[qo]C[Jahz: W happy with this result]
;B[dm];W[dn];B[bl];W[cm];B[ck];W[bq];B[br];W[cp];B[dq];W[ar]
;B[cr];W[bm]
(;B[jg]C[Daedin: This feels too vague, and that was what I felt at the time too. However I did not find any god move to attack White's group (it looks alive) and did not want White to reduce easily around L16.]

(;W[lq]C[Jahz: i feel behind so i invade, but that's no so good because it's obvious i'll end gote, and B will be able to close the top. Maybe i should try to reduce in sente at top, reinforcing my central group in the same time, then invade.]
