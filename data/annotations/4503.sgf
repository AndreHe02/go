C[My opening is perhaps the weakest part fo my game right now.  I always feel I need to make up a great deal of ground by the time the middle game starts.  Any advice on improving my opening, and the shift in to midgame would be welcome.

I usually compare openings from my games with pro game openings. If you regularly review recent pro games you will get a better feeling for the opening.]

;W[co]C[Approaching from the inside at this time is a bit unconventional but not bad. I think black should play a pincer to put  a little pressure on white.]

(;B[pp]C[Tenuki seems fine as well];W[fc];B[cf];W[ci]C[White is trying  a strategy of fast and thin development.]

(;B[hc];W[jc]
(;B[id]TR[fc]C[I think this move is not good, because white can handle F17 lightly and invade the corner for a satisfiying result. Actually i think this move caused a lot of trouble for black.]
;W[jd];B[hf]
(;W[je]
(;B[pe]LB[cl:A][dl:B]C[locally correct approach move, you could also start a fight with A or B.  I think the result in the top left corner is better for white because of the C17 invasion.]

(;W[qc];B[ne]C[Nice move];W[of]C[I think this peep helps black]
;B[oe]
(;W[ff];B[ec]C[Good idea];W[fd]C[Now you have to cosider carefully how you are going to attack the heavy white group. You have to find a plan where your own weak group at H17 doesn't suffer too much. Also consider the overextended white stones at the left side. The 3 black stones in the corner are also important because they shouldn't become enclosed in the corner.

However it's quite hard to find a good plan for black here.]

(;B[mc]C[I underestimated the strength of the coming cut, and paid for it.  How might this sequence have been altered for a better result in the area?

You are playing too hasty. White has no intention to play at M16 right now so you can leave this area alone for a few more moves. When your stones at H14 are a bit stronger then it might be a good idea to try to attack the white group at K16 but at the moment they are too strong.]

Mostly that stemmed from the loss of the N17 group, and that was from an overestimation of its ability to live.  However, I am faced all too often with saving an important group like that, and it is often the case that there are just no tricks that will work to make an invading group live.  I would like to open better so such situations aren't required, or easily developed, and I missed the point somewhere along the way on how to do that.]
