C[Celebrir:
Hi,

This game was my first game on this level with a diagonal fuseki. I don't know how to handle this and would be thankful for every comment about this topic. Besides I added some questions and ideas. It would be nice if you comment on them :) Of course I would be thankful for every other comment as well ;)

In the game I will start my comments with "C:"];B[cp];W[pp]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[jq];W[nc];B[lc]C[C: Maybe I should choose o15 here ?]
;W[qf]C[This move is good. R17 is an option, too.];B[pf]C[C: I admit I don't know the joseki drom here on. But after it was done I didn't feel to bad.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rd];B[qg];W[rf];B[ph]
;W[pc]C[Yes, that result is not bad for White.];B[qn];W[nq]
C[C: I thought this was a nice outcoming because it is still easy to invade R10 or something like this and the M17 stone is also unsettled while i get a big corner.]
;B[ce];W[ch];B[ee];W[fd];B[bc]C[C: Maybe I should have played F16 at G17, because then I needn't fear h17 and could play C9 now ?

G17 may have been better because of the stone at M17. Anyway, black would have the opportunity to attack C12. So if you are afraid, not to play the pincer might have been better.]
;W[ic];B[cj];W[eh];B[fe];W[gd];B[dg];W[dh];B[me];W[dk]C[C: Is there a other possibility to attack C10 or make the D12 stones stronger ?

I think this is a good move, because it makes Black low and strengthens your group. I don't think you can attack C10 severely without putting your own group in danger.]
;B[ck];W[cl]C[C: Maybe D8 instead of C8 ?

This move is not possible. D8 is correct.];B[dj];W[ek];B[ej]
;W[fj];B[dl];W[el];B[dm];W[cm];B[cn];W[bn];B[co];W[bk];B[bj]
;W[bl];B[bo];W[bi];B[ak];W[em];B[dn];W[fi];B[rp];W[qq];B[gp]
;W[ql]C[This is good. S4 spoiled the corner invasion.];B[on]
;W[ol];B[mn];W[rh];B[pk];W[qk];B[pj];W[pl];B[gk]C[Bad move. You are happy to connect.]
;W[fk];B[mk];W[md];B[ld];W[le];B[ke];W[lf];B[mf];W[kf];B[je]
;W[jf];B[ie];W[if];B[he]C[C: Pusching one more time to prevent the tesuji, which appears later ?

I think pushing one more time or G13 would be good. I guess you didn't want to spoil the cut, but Black H14 will defend the cut anyway.]
;W[jc];B[kd];W[ii];B[hf];W[hg];B[gg];W[gh]C[Just extend to H12 instead.]
;B[cb];W[db];B[ed];W[ec];B[ig];W[hh];B[jh]C[C: I didn't see a got way to save my stones. That was the reason i sacrificed them.

Yes the stones are captured.];W[ki];B[lg];W[ji];B[kh]C[This was not necessary.]
;W[hm];B[gn];W[km]C[C: So I lost my stones, but i was happy that it was possible to make F10 stronger

But i think you lack points now.];B[rq];W[rr];B[mr];W[nr];B[sr]
;W[pr]C[C: That looks very bad, but what to do against that ?

This is why Black S3 was huge.
You could have played M3 instead of S2, but I don't think you can expect  a much better result after S3.]
;B[gm];W[iq]C[This is an overplay. The middle group is not really alive.]
;B[hq];W[ip];B[ir];W[gl];B[hl];W[fl];B[im];W[hn]C[This doesn't work for White. See variation.]

(;B[ho];W[in];B[io];W[jn];B[jo];W[fo];B[go];W[ep]C[Black can cut at E6]
;B[dq];W[eq]C[C: That was a fast playing mistake... Should have been at E6]
;B[en]C[The game is clearly over now.];W[lh]C[This is no good.]
;B[li];W[mh]
(;B[lj];W[og];B[ng];W[oh];B[qh];W[mg];B[kg];W[ne];B[nf];W[oi]
;B[nj]C[Should be Q11.];W[pi];B[qj];W[qi];B[rj];W[mi]C[C: I thought it was a nice exchange because there is still aji in the r8 stones

You would have to kill Black's group in order to win. I don't think its possible.]
;B[ll]
(;W[nm];B[nn];W[mm];B[lm];W[ln];B[lo];W[kn];B[jl]C[C: I missed this tesuji nad that was the final mistake, but i think i was already behind before because of the big territory at E3.]
;W[kl];B[kk];W[hk];B[il];W[ml];B[lk];W[nk];B[oj];W[mj];B[nh]
;W[rg];B[ni]C[C:
To sum it up, I think my biggest mistakes were C8 and the missing of K12 and K8 tesujis. I should have used my time better at this points but it is difficult to play slow if you're oponnent plays fast.

Thanks a lot for every comment !



C8 was probably the losing move. There were several mistakes which could be avoided by reading just a few moves ahead.]
