C[Hi i am Vart and i played Black versus musha who is 2k on KGS.



I prefer a review of the both side please.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]

C[janr: It is unusual for white to be so aggressive.
I think A is an important point now.]
(;B[gc];W[hc];B[ge]LB[fb:A][hd:B]C[Perhaps A is more important than B now.]

(;W[hd];B[fb]C[Good or bad for black? I didn't want to play C17 instead of this move. I prefer this because i think white become heavy.

janr: the result is good for black.]
(;W[cc];B[mc];W[if];B[fg];W[dh];B[fq]C[F3 seems a big point in this fuseki.

janr: unfortunately, white is making territory on the left.
And H18 will create a weak black group.]
(;W[cn];B[ip];W[qn]
(;B[nq]TR[ip]C[O3/O4 or a pincer? At this point, i prefer to play quietly.

janr: As the marked stone is far and high, black would like to get a wall.
On the other hand, the running battle between the two groups on the top (F17 vs H17) is becoming more and more urgent, so black would like to have sente.]
;W[qk]

janr: a hoshi with two small extension is not so good because the 3-3 point is still open.
Also, the running battle is still there.];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]

;B[mf]LB[oe:A]C[now, black ends un with difficult to use thickness (because of gote), chasing the white group in the running battle first.]
;W[ih]C[janr: and the black group is forced to run too.];B[hg]
C[I don't know if this move is good or no.]
(;W[ig]C[Maybe White at L14 is better?

janr: just defending looks ok for white.  
L14 may leave bad aji.];B[fi];W[dj]C[White makes more territory while black runs and the other white group runs too and gets influence.]

(;B[pm]C[
janr: I dont know how to create thinkness pressing on the white group on the right.
Maybe it is still more urgent to play ahead in the running battle to see in which direction white moves?]
;W[qm];B[ol];W[rp]C[
janr: If white thinks he can live without this move, I think the center is more important.]
;B[im];W[ij];B[hi];W[kj];B[kl];W[hp]C[janr: this may not be the best invasion point.  
the variations give black much territory]

[ml][nl][jm][in][on][oo][op][iq][pq][ir][pr][is][ps]C[I don't want fight here because i think Black is a little ahead.
janr: I'm not so good at counting:
White has 33+7+7+6.5=53.5
Black has 16+37=53
So, perhaps black is not so much ahead?
janr: the game move seems to give white a chance to get something along the lower side.]

(;W[fr]C[Apart from the cut, notice that this move strengthens black.  If white has better eye shape (e.g. A at B), then it might not be necessary to strengthen black so much.]
;B[er];W[gr];B[dq]LB[eq:A]C[This should be at A]
(;W[ep]C[Maybe some mistakes for the both players here...
it seems not good for white to play here immediately.  First prevent black from living locally, forcing him to connect, then live locally too.]
