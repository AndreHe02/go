C[Dear Reviewer,

My name is Bjoern Stein, I learned playing Go about a year ago, but have hardly played until I started attending the weekly meetings of the Brisbane Go Club about one month ago.

Stronger players there suggest that I've problems with joseki (true, I don't know any) and with keeping my stones connected, especially in high-handicap games.
  I feel that another major weakness of mine is the tendency to play for center influence -- which I either regularly fail to judge correctly, or fail to turn into territory in about half the games that I play. I also have big problems in deciding wheter a move is sente or not.

The game that I ask you to review for me has been played on igs between mousse (W, 19k*) and steinb79 (B, myself, 20k (?)). Whilst it was a huge win for me, I feel certain that there must have been problems with my moves that could've been exploited; please point at least the biggest blunders out to me, as I usually cannot detect them myself.

The mayor reason that I'm submitting this particular game is that, although I did win, I am unable to identify moves where white could have done much better (except maybe one or two). I think it would help me a lot if you could add variations that would have changed the ability of groups to run towards the center. I am particularily interested in the white group along the top center, as it seems that this group had the ability to destroy the big center territory that black ended having. I'm not sure how white could have used this group, however, as earlier play there   Thank you for your time and effort!


Dave, the reviewer writes:
Hi Bjoern (you don't happen to know my friend Bill Hooker from Brisbane, do you?), I'll do my best to find areas where I can suggest new ideas.

First a couple of things... Your introductory text intrigued me in that you discussed your problems building territory in the center.  I don't know if you've heard the proverb, "there is no territory in the center".  While that's not 100% true, of course, it is much harder to build territory in the center, and it's best not to look to the center for territory, at least not until later in the game.  The center is more a place to run when your groups are in trouble and connect with living groups elsewhere.

Second, the joseki comment from the stronger players in your club.  I am kind of surprised by that, because in my mind, a beginner shouldn't concentrate too hard on learning joseki.  A few standard moves are useful to know, but you'll gain those through experience and watching other games.  I'd save studying joseki until you are much stronger, because really you won't understand most of what you are studying until then.  I am a 7kyu on KGS and I've only begun to scratch the surface of joseki.  I don't feel I've missed anything by waiting until now, and I honestly still don't feel fully prepared to understand most of the joseki discussion, so I wouldn't worry about that.

Now onto the game.

David Adams];B[dp]C[stein:
This, of course, is the wrong corner.
I'm very glad my opponent didn't mind this impolite opening.


dave> I have found few online opponents who mind, but it's still harmless to follow protocol. :)]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed];W[dc]
(;B[df]C[dave> probably a better response would be E17 (see variation) unless you are trying to build on the left side.  As it is, white can slip under you at E16.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[cf];B[dg];W[ec];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[id]C[dave> now white has a big corner and with J16 he's threatening to make your wall you've built from G17 to D13 useless, too]
;B[kc]TR[kd][ld]C[stein:

Was this too daring?
Should I (black) have defended againt W G15 first?
If not, what answer would black have had?

dave> no, i think this is the right idea.  I would suggest L16 or M16 instead to better match your pincer stone with your wall's height. W G15 is annoying, but like I said in the previous move's comments, your concern here is to utilize the wall you've built facing to the right, and playing G15 or something around there would waste it, as white played M16 and built lots of influence.]
;W[hb];B[hc];W[ic];B[gb];W[eb]C[stein:
I keep wondering wheter  a move like N17 or maybe even M/N 16 would have been better for white.
Most of all, how should black respond to such a move?

dave> I think this whole sequence by white is a little wasteful, but at the same time it's pinning your stones in.  I would play B O17 next because white's J17 group is now serving as a wall to pinch your L17 stone with his Q16 stone, so your L17 needs a base.  Not only that, but whilte's J17 group is almost connected to his safe UL corner, and is now pinching on your big wall you've built, rendering it totally useless, a big glob of stones with few spaces for eyes that you have to protect.  You should struggle to make each of your groups an asset.  It's starting to look like your G17 group will only be a liability.]
;B[ib]C[dave> This is not a bad move, either.  It aims to connect your stones and eliminate the power of white's J17 group]
;W[jb];B[ha];W[jc]C[dave> but now L17 is in trouble];B[ke];W[he]
;B[ge]TR[nc][jg]SQ[ed][ee][df][dg]C[dave> I think you should focus on building a base for your L17 group (with O17 perhaps) or keep putting the pressure on white's group with K13 perhaps.  G15 gives you an eye, but you don't really need one.  You should be driving white against your wall (marked with squares) as much as you can.]
;W[if]C[dave> white could have jumped further out to J13 and still been connected.]
;B[je]C[dave> this move doesn't really gain you anything.  jump out to K13 instead or across to O17.]
;W[ie];B[nc]C[dave> good.  there's still the threat of a white clamp at M17, but this extra space is nice, plus you are attacking Q16.  That's another thing to look for: moves that accomplish two things.]
;W[oc];B[ne]C[dave> I would play O16 or O18 here instead to be a bit thicker because now white can clamp you on either side, or both.]
;W[gf];B[ff];W[gg];B[cg];W[bf];B[bg];W[dd]C[stein:
This white move felt functionless -- what threat would black have had without it?

dave> I'm not sure.  White needs to extend down the right side from Q16 now more than anything.  He also needs to establish himself on the bottom of the board, since you've eaten into his potential for territory at the top.  D16 was a wasted move, good call.  Before looking at your next move, black should either extend down the left to D8 or C8 perhaps.  Or a threat up the top right with R14 if you are feeling agressive or R11 if not.]
;B[cl]C[dave> perfect!  Very nice.];W[pg]C[dave> white grabs a good move and pressures your top group, but he is weak underneath if black is feeling agressive.  I think Black R10 would be good here to prevent white from making a long knight jump from Q13.  Or even R9 to get tighter with your hoshi stone at Q4.  You need to watch out for your L17 group, tho.]
;B[pm]C[dave> not bad, and it's the right idea.  I would have gone farther, because now white can easily play R10 or even R9 comfortably.]
;W[nq];B[lq]TR[jq][kq]C[I like the pincer, but it's a little tight.  I'd play L3 or even K3 instead to get a nice double wing formation going on the lower left.]
;W[no];B[lo];W[pq];B[op];W[np];B[mm]TR[qp][oq][qq]C[dave> I think one of the marked plays would be stronger, because your Q4 group is looking weak now, but you have the right idea to build pressure and expand your moyo with N7.  I cannot say it is a bad move, but I feel like you need to protect your corner stones more than you need to attack white at this point.]
;W[qq];B[on]C[stein:

In retrospect, this move seems to accomplish very little, if at all.

My original aim was to put pressure on the three st
ones around O4 whilst also building a wall around the white group, but I now wonder if I (black) should have played R4 or R5 instead.

dave> You are right.  R4 seems best, and probably should have been played instead of N7.  The three stones are safe, I think, having driven into the corner for plenty of eyespace.  P6 is really cramped and serves no real purpose.  You should be defending, expanding moyo, or taking territory, even while you attack.  This play doesn't even really attack, since the stones are already safe.]
;W[qo];B[or]TR[qn][hq]C[stein:

This seemed to be a great way to put pressure on the white group, and safe enough, as this stone has O3 and P3 as miai for connection.

However, in the fight white seems to have gotten a free, small wall at L 2/3 plus one extension, which helped white to get a little moyo. Could black have prevented that? How? Both G3 and J4 seem to leave openings, especially since I'm used to getting the worse out of josekis, and therefore fear corner invasions.

Since defending the corner would be a gote move:
Are there other big sente moves on the board that black should play first?

(
The reason for this question:
It seems to me that all white positions except for the lower right corner cannot easily be attacked, and that something like O 13 lacks threat.
On the other hand, an attack like R11 seems to invite white to extend into the center from the upper right corner, which would both strengthen the G 13 group and severely hinder any possible black moyo extending from the lower left towards the center.  )

dave> I think this was a bad move.  But then in my eyes white's corner is beyond safe.  You say you are afraid of corner invasions, but this invasion has come and gone and you lost.  The thing is: if you play on 4-4, you will get invaded.  Go is give and take, and you can't win everything.  If the enemy invades your corner, let him have it, but give him a small corner and seal him in.  Already white has snuck out to R5 and undermined whatever territory you might have built on the right with R11.  Your stone may be safe, or may not be, but any gain you get will be too small to matter.  There are bigger plays and more urgent plays to be made.

R6 would threaten white's R5 stone and give you a last chance for some territory on the side with a later move up towards the top with R11 perhaps.  Another option is H3 which would be huge in terms of solidifying your double wing on the lower left.  White would have a hard time finding much to steal in there.]
;W[oq];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[kq];B[lp];W[kr];B[lr];W[ip]C[dave> see, you have protected your P2 stone, but now white is established in your moyo!  However, you have made progress in threatening white's corner after all.]
;B[gq]C[dave> good idea.];W[gp];B[fp]C[dave> I would prefer F3.  Don't fight every chance you get.  When the enemy attaches like he did with G4, extend, don't attack.  At least not unless you have it all read out.  Extending is much safer and stronger in the end.  Fighting like this makes reading more complex meaning it's harder for you to play.]
;W[hq];B[gr];W[go];B[fl]C[You ended up okay without much fighting.  I would have played F5 instead of F8, but F8 is not bad either.  You may be aiming to split the lower and upper white groups which are truly pretty pressed.]
;W[dn]C[dave> this looks desperate to me, but it may just be white leaping farther than he should.  B F5 would punish this and give you solid shape.]
;B[fo]C[dave> good];W[cp]
(;B[co]C[stein:
This move felt wrong, yet I cannot tell how black should have defended.
What whould have been the best move for black in the corner?

dave> that's a good question.  Like I said, you can't win everything.  But the key if you are going to fight is reading reading reading.  You have to be able to read several moves ahead until the sequence is determined.  It's tough when you are starting out, but you just have to practice every time there is a fight.  I did a few variations.  I think C3 would have been better.  C5 fails because white has a supporting stone ready to help cut you off at D6.  I say this not having read on in the game... so we'll see.]

(;W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[stein:

Considering that black was already blocking the right side of the lower left corner, should black (I) have defended with B5, rather than D3?

dave> I think D5 would have been best.  The corner is probably white's if he plays right, but there's a dangerous cutting point at D5 with a supporting white stone!  I think it's best to block there.  Then W B5 is not such a threat.]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[dr];B[an]C[dave> wrong side.  You should be worried about other things than attacking here.]
;W[bp];B[gn]C[stein:
I remember being nervous about the consequences of W D5, B C7, W E3 (or similar), but it didn't seem worth giving up the opportunity to move elsewhere...
However, I wonder at what stage white should have taken advantage of it.

dave> I think W E3 is the only move to worry about in that sequence.  It's a few points, so worth worrying about, but it's enclosed and there are bigger fish to fry.  G6 was a good way to put pressure on.]
;W[ho];B[hn];W[in];B[jo]C[dave> again this kikashi (forcing move) gets you nothing really.  J7 is better now.]
;W[io];B[im];W[jn];B[jm];W[ln];B[kn];W[ko];B[kp];W[km];B[lm]
;W[mn]C[dave> not sure what white was thinking... he should have played the ko]
;B[kl];W[jp];B[nn];W[mo];B[ko];W[hr];B[er]C[stein:
I (black) was glad to be able to defend like this -- how could white have taken the biggest advantage of black's weakness (see comment at move 87)?

dave> Like I said, I think it's a few points, nothing to sneeze at, but it's not a huge weakness either.  I think E3 would have hurt had it been a closer game.  As it is white should be worried about his top group as you've sealed the bottom in completely.  Well done.  You also have a nice chunk of territory on the left.  You just need to keep white from getting huge gains on the right and you're home free.]
;W[do];B[cm];W[ds];B[es];W[gs];B[jq]C[stein:
I made a silly mistake with this move; please don't bother with explaining it.
I guess I could've taken (a small) advantage of the weakness I was aiming at by playing at L1.

dave> I think all these plays can wait till later.  There is more to do in the middle and particularly the right.]
;W[jr]C[
 mousse 19k*: yes, from Vend e];B[fh]TR[jg][kh]C[dave> I think this is the wrong side to pressure white from.  You are strong on the left.  Weak on the right.  So you need to push from the right.  The marked moves are better.  They strengthen your weak group and pressure white.  Your move drives white towards your weaker group, making it even more vulnerable, and also towards more white stones.]
;W[gh];B[fi];W[jh]C[stein:
It seems very sensible of white to try making eye space;
however, looking at the big center moyo black is allowed to build in the process, I wonder if there had been better alternatives.

dave> You do have a lot of territory on the left.  I worry more about your group at the top, and the fact that white's group could be pressured more]
;B[ii]TR[lg][lh][mh][li]C[dave> I think one of the marked moves is better.  You want to drive white towards your strength, not your weakness.  You are strong on the bottom and the left, not the top or the right.]
;W[ih];B[ji];W[kg];B[mh]C[dave> finally the right idea.  It's too late to kill white, though.]
;W[lf];B[ng];W[le];B[ld];W[lh];B[li];W[hg];B[qi]C[dave> good, needed play.  but white has you undermined below.]
;W[qk];B[oi];W[ok]C[stein:
Would W S7 or even W R7 have been better?

Yes, I think so.  White is trying to eat some of your territory, but he'd do better to keep his groups alive and build his own territory instead.  Plus he now has a weakness at S13.]

;B[nd];W[mc];B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[kd];B[kb];W[ob];B[nb];W[gi]
C[dave> oops, you lost a lot in that sequence.  White actually gained some territory that shouldn't have existed.  Your early one-point jumps were probably too bold, and made it hard to stay connected.]
;B[gj];W[mg];B[mf];W[nh]C[stein:
This white counter-attack came unexpected;
Could white have achieved something useful with any other move than M13?

dave> I think it's a good move by white.  Again, he didn't fight the ko, it seems.]
;B[lg];W[mi];B[kh]C[dave> well done, white should have fought the ko and he could have had a (small) chance of saving his midright group and cutting you in two.]

stein:

At this time, I still had about 8 moves left, and less than half a minute to make them since I hadn't payed attention to the time I spent thinking about my next move. The next moves have therfore been played in a hurry.]
;W[qh];B[ri];W[rg];B[fg];W[hi];B[hj];W[po]C[stein:
During the game I was somehow convinced that the group P/Q 4 was connected, but now it's obvious that W P5 instead of W 214 (Q5) would've captured them in gote.
Was giving up sente worth enough so that white's move, allowing B to save his stones, was correct? Doesn't that imply I should've had better plays elsewhere?played elsewhere? If so, where? C2, which we both didn't seem to notice until the end of the game?
Another question that I can't find a convincing anwser for myself:
Would I have been better off playing Q6, considering that this move becomes sente for white (or so I believe) in move W 238? What about S6?


dave> You ask a lot of good questions.  I am not so great in the endgame.  My advice is that, except for C2, the four points are worth the effort at this late stage.  There is little else on the board worth more.  I don't think white has many true sente moves left, but like I said, my endgame analysis is weak.]

Well played, you did great at using your center influence for lots of territory there.  White won all four corners, but there is a proverb that goes something like, "he who wins all four corners will lose the game".  I think the point is that if you focus on the corners, you will be missing the outer influence (which you used very well) to build territory elsewhere.  I think you got lucky with the territory you got on the right.  White didn't exploit your weakness there correctly.

You'll also notice that your stones are all in one big connected group, while white has six separate groups.  Keeping connected is key, because then your stones can work more efficiently to surround territory, which is the goal.

Good game.  I fear I am not the best reviewer, but I hope you will find some wisdom in the advice I've given.  Feel free to correspond with me if you have more questions or need any clarification, or if you ever want to play!  I'm daveadams on KGS.  I have never played on IGS, but maybe someday.
