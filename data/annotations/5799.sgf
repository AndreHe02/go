C[Hello there, hope you find my review helpful. Of course any questions you have you can email me.


Hello reviewer. I played black in this game on KGS. In this game I feel as if I got off to a decent start, but mishandled the situation on the bottom half of the board, thus creaing weak groups. Any comments and/or suggestions you can make regarding the game would be great.]
