;B[pd]C[hi,
and thank you very much for reviwing this game!i am the white playerIn
the end white won on time, but careful counting tells me the game is
extremely close. i feel like i could have done better in the
middle-game.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[mp];B[np]C[i will ask some
questions if its ok :)  i was unsure what to do here, but i thought that
it might be best to give black some points in the corner (and maybe use
the aji of r3) and take influence

Yes. My style as black here
would have been to simply play Q5, enclosing a big corner and keeping
white weak. As white, I would be content to give black a big territory
if I can get strong on the outside; then the moyo between Q16 and R9
won't be important later.

I think white's move (N4) is a bit of
an unusual approach, too. Now that I think about it some more, my
response of Q5 would have been bad. At this early stage, since I have
the support of R9, if white plays N4 I should do something more
aggressive. Hm, but if I play around K4 and white plays Q5, I might
feel unhappy. That's why Q5 is my first reaction.

Openings are hard!

I still feel like N4 is too early to get so close.  Play around K4 or K16 or C15 or ...]
;W[mq]C[I
don't think this is the right direction. You play here, and black plays
O5, and black's moyo has gotten much too strong while you still need
another move on the lower side to defend the N3/4 stick. You should
move out to N5 yourself, thinking large scale.];B[no]C[This
exchange looks good for black. Would you have played N3 (before N4)? No
way! Imagine these same stones being played as N3 (clearly too low!),
so black replies with the shoulder hit of O4 (reasonable, but maybe a
pincer is better), white plays N4, black O5 ... white has clearly made
a mistake to play N3. This is a moyo game, not a territory game.]
;W[ip]C[i was satisfied with this result

You shouldn't be!  Black gets a big moyo, white just gets a little bit of one side.  And black gets sente too!]
;B[mo]C[apperently
this nobi is big, but i thought it would be wrong direction to answer
this immediatelly.so i played a kakari at o17

This turn is HUGE;
black's moyo is looking great, and white won't be able to make a moyo
out of the top or left side any more. However the top is also big, so
the trade of this move for the first shot at the O17 area seems about
even. Black still maintains the lead.];W[nc];B[pf]C[I might be
tempted as black to try to use that thickness below to make a really
huge moyo, by playing O16 or O15 instead of this move, but with the
distance being so big and R9 being low, this move looks fine too.]
;W[kd];B[cf]C[here
i thought pretty long (whats the best answer to tease black i thought)i
came to the conclusion that it might be best to pincer and and help the
lower side to develop since i have quite some influence there

Black
is playing the wrong direction here. Since black is so thick at the
bottom, white's moyo won't be able to get as big as black's. Black
should just keep increasing the moyo. I would play O10 maybe, but even
that looks too small. For you to play L16 close was a good idea; if
it's K16 then black obviously plays N15 and wins. Even L14 is tempting
for black.

There's no really good way for white to answer this
move. if you pincer at C12 or so you still won't get a big moyo in the
bottom left. I think simply C16 is best.];W[cj]C[This pincer is too
far: no real pressure on black's stone. But in this position it's not
too bad, since it works well with D4.];B[cc];W[cd]C[i didnt want to give black an too easy game with c18, so i played c16 and waited for blacks response

Yes, you have to play here in this position, no doubt about that.]
;B[dd]
(;W[de]C[This is the wrong move order for white.  Atari the corner stone first.]
;B[ed]C[If
white plays B17 now, it might be too late: black may cut at C15 and let
white have the corner in exchange for a beautiful outside.]

(;W[ce];B[bc];W[db]C[This gets very complicated!  It sure looks like black is ahead in the capturing race, though.]

(;B[ee];W[df]C[This is a terrible exchange for black: Black is throwing away all the aji of his stones.]
;B[ef];W[cg];B[bf];W[eg]C[This
is SO bad for black: is black going to live in the corner now? Is black
going to capture D17/18? It looks very tough.];B[ec]C[Even now if
white plays B18 it looks hard for black to win the capturing race in
the corner. So white has gained a lot on the left side and corner too.
But L16 has become weak, and C10 is too close to white's strong
position. So even with black's mistakes, white is still not doing very
well. White C/D15 were not so good.];W[bd]C[Why move here? White is
already strong on the left side. Black should answer with E18 and white
L16 looks even weaker.];B[cb]C[i think this result is very ok for
whitebut it was still hard to find the next move. i was tending between
r17, j17, q or p 10 and maybe r3

This is not such a good way to
answer for black: the most important thing in this game now is what
happens to the L16/O17 group. E18 is a much better move for black for
that reason, even if it loses a few points in the corner.

Among
your choices: R17 is bad, black gives you the corner and then viciously
attackes O17 group. J17 is the right idea but it looks too
overconcentrated: after that move, black may let your group live with
more moves like P17 and you get very overconcentrated here.

Q or
P 10 would be terrible overplays: with N5 on the board, that stone
would be very weak, and as black chases it there'd be no time to defend
O17 or L16.

R3???  Black gets sente and attacks O17/L16 group.

So the only move that makes any sense among your choices is J17, but even that is heading too much right into black's wall.

I
thought L14 was the best move on the board, but it doesn't really make
that great of a shape either, though it does have a bit of an effect of
neutralizing black's moyo, so it's not bad either.

Then finally
I decided that you should move at F13 or maybe G13. That lends some
help to L16 while making your moyo bigger at the same time. That's the
right way to defend.

The moves you are thinking of here shows you do not think of the three rules when you choose your move.  The three rules are
FIRST, where am I weak?  Answer: L16/O17 group.

SECOND, where is my opponent weak?  Answer: nowhere (this shows your game is not very good so far!)

THIRD:
where is there territory to be taken? Answer: white's big lower left
moyo, black's big lower right moyo, are the big territories.

Therefore,
the move you make MUST help defend the L16/O17 group, and while doing
so should try to either enlarge white's moyo or reduce black's at the
same time. Hence L14 or F13/G13 are the right areas to look at.

If
you really are excited about that little tiny corner, instead of R17,
play Q17! That stays connected to O17, so it helps defend your group.

Your
first priority must be to defend that group.];W[qc]C[i thought going
into the corner and take sente was the best thing to do

You won't get sente: black plays Q17, and now your O17 group is in big trouble.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[qf];W[pe]
;B[oe];W[qd];B[of]C[now i was thinking again. something like o16 then j17, or r3

This
move is a bit slow for black. But now LOOK how much stronger black's
right side moyo has become! And look how weak your L16 stone is! And
all for just a few points in the corner. White should lose this game
with moves like these.

Now there's certainly no chance of P10 or
anything like that in your future: that stone would just get swallowed
right up. And L16's future is not so good either.

R3 would be a disaster: black would let you live in the corner and take sente.

At
least O16/J17 combination is showing that you're thinking about the
right group, though still trying to live on the edge there is
ridiculous. Get out into the center; maybe in the future, from there,
you can help your left side moyo or reduce black's right side moyo.
L14, or F13/G13, still look good to me.];W[qq]C[i took the most greedy point i guess. but i for myself think that r3 was the right move here

I
think you are looking at rule #3 (where is the territory?) and ignoring
rule #1 and 2 (your own, and your opponent's, weaknesses). If you take
territory like this early in the game, you will pay the price later in
the game when your opponent's stones are all rock-solid while yours are
invadable.

You can only take territory WHILE attacking your opponent's weakness, or while defending your own, in the early game.]
;B[qp];W[pr];B[rq];W[oq];B[pp];W[qr];B[nq]C[This
is a terrible move for black; if not this move, then S2 later threatens
O2, but now S2 is not a threat at all. It's almost always wrong to fill
in your own liberty by pushing in like this, unless you're going to cut
on your next move.];W[nr]C[of course this is sente for black, but i was still satisfied

Black
has sente, and white has the only weak group on the board; black's moyo
is surrounded by all these strong stones, while white's still has
plenty of big spaces for invasions; therefore black is going to win.]
;B[ic]C[it was logical that this move followed, but still it was quite painful of course

Yes,
but I think L14 would have been even better for black: J17 doesn't take
territory, and now white runs away to destroy black's moyo. After L14
it's still not easy for white to live on the edge -- probably black
still has sente and gets to play M10 or something like that, and look
how huge that is!];W[nd];B[od]C[This exchange suggests that black
P14 should have been at O16 instead perhaps. Look at black's horrible
shape (Q17/16 are very silly stones!)];W[id]C[i thought that trying
to live there small was very bad, so i played the nobi-tsuke of j16. is
there a good way to make sabaki (now or earlier)?

EARLIER! This
is a good idea, though, it's black's territory anyway so lean on this
stone as much as possible in order to spring farther out into the
center.];B[jd]C[This looks bad for black: after this move, by sacrificing one stone somewhere white can probably get settled.]
;W[je];B[jc];W[ke]C[This
is too slow and heavy for white. Try L13 instead perhaps. O17/16 are
not important stones: they are like peeps, force and then sacrifice
willingly later since black has already wasted stones (Q16/17) in
exchange for them. Get out! Connect to E13 and make a big moyo for
yourself, or at least reduce black's potential by getting out into the
center. Play light!];B[lg]C[i love this move m13! its just perfect in my opinion

That's
right! That's why L15 was a huge mistake. L15 should have been here, or
at L13. This is indeed a very good move for black. The game should be
over by now ...];W[jh];B[li]C[Black calmly takes a huge territory.]
;W[hd]C[White's group will probably live now.];B[hc]C[Not
necessary for black, is it? Black can play N18 or this move later to
save these three stones; this side territory is not very big compared
to the big moyos. I would play K10 instead of this.];W[mh]C[if this move is ok i wonder... ;)but i somehow wanted to create some aji there, else it would become to big

It
is far too late to be messing around here! NOw that black has strongly
played H17, you should continue defending your group. Black is looking
at H14 ... ouch!];B[lh];W[lk]C[Now finally you discover what light play looks like.]
;B[ji]C[A
little too solid for black here. F13 maybe, lean on that stone a bit
first, and then figure out how to attack white's big group.]
;W[ih];B[ii]C[I'd
rather see black make];W[mj]C[Now white makes another heavy group. This
stone should be running away, not diving in! What will you do after
black K5, let's say? I can easily see all three of these stones getting
swallowed up.];B[hh]C[Black is thinking of killing white's group.
But if it lives, this move won't gain much territory. Black should have
attacked M9 instead.];W[hg];B[gg];W[gh];B[hi];W[gf];B[fg];W[if]
C[Looks
like white lives now -- that's fine for both players -- the question is
how black attacks M9 now.];B[eh];W[dg];B[ff]C[No! This could be a
game losing move for black. The F stones are not important. The M9
group is where the game will be decided. Black just gave up a free
move.];W[ge]C[Is this group going to die if you don't play here?
Hm, maybe it would. Maybe this is necessary. But you should look very
carefully at the aji around here before you waste a move like this. M9
is very desperate!];B[ml]C[Black attacks in the wrong direction
here. Now, if white lives, black will not have done so much to reduce
white's moyo. Chase white TOWARD the thickness: play around K5, or K8.
K8 looks really good to me, actually. This move is good for spoiling
white's eye shape to live inside, though, but white doesn't want to
live inside anyway.];W[kl]C[A nice solid move.  If this works, white suddenly has a good game again.]
;B[il]C[This is one move too late: white has so much more potential of linking up to J4/N4 now that L8 is on the board.]
;W[kn];B[ko];W[jo];B[kp]C[Now black only gets a good game if he can kill something.]
;W[jm]C[A good safe move.];B[lp];W[lr]C[Another good safe move.]
;B[fq]C[this shape really really looks strange, i admit it :P

Here
is where you have to look at your weak group (J4 still not quite having
eyes) and the territory (MUCH bigger up the left side). If you can
afford E3, to take territory up the left, then it's probably a good
move. But if it hurts J4 too much, then you can't do it.];W[fp]
C[is this the right answer?

If
you can win the game with it, it's good. It's the safer move, but it
loses a lot of territory. So ... if you still have enough territory,
it's OK, but if you need more in the corner and left side, then it's no
good. By my count, even with komi I would want to play a little more
territorial of a move at this point in the game. D3 probably would have
been my choice, closing the corner for sure.];B[gp];W[fo]
(;B[eq]C[I would play C3 here, sacrificing these stones in exchange for a big corner.]
;W[dq];B[go]C[Black is taking some chances here!  There are many moves that will make the G3 cut possible for later ...]
;W[gn];B[hq];W[dn]C[from
here on i dont have specific questions anymore, but i would very much
appreciate it if u could take a look at my major mistakes :)

This
last exchange was very bad for black: white got the territory on the
left side, and what did black get with these stones? Basically nothing!]
;B[iq];W[hn]C[A
very safe move. Are you so far ahead that you can afford it? Hm,
probably so. Where's the big endgame? S2 looks pretty nice. P10 looks
quite big. Yeah, P10 would be my choice for white.];B[cl]C[This looks like too much!  Can black really survive this?]

is playing very calm, like white is winning. I'm not so sure that white
can be so relaxed here. P11 instead of P12 might have made a big
difference?];W[sf]C[White has to be careful about the life of this corner group.]
