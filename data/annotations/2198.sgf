xxc : Reviewer, i'll go on with the game and add comment from both sides as it comes.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[qc]C[xxc : this is too early.

1 - As long as black do not add a move in the upper righ corner, white can still play here and grab the corner. So ... no reason to play it now.

2 - This gives black the chance to build a strong wall ... this will give him an advance during all the game.

3 - The value of this move is too small at this stage of the game. Arround 10 points ... C5 nearly has the same value ... without the wall for black ... and other moves are biggers C9 K16 R11

4 - The white stone is not in relation with other stones ... She do not "work" well with her friends ... and will be cut from them.

Please, try to forget this move "now", so early ... and keep it in mind as a good play latter on the game.]

(;B[qd]C[xxc : This side seems more natural. To build a wall facing the shimari in the lower right corner is attractive ... but perhaps chosing the other side could be interesting]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[rd]LB[ob:A]C[xxc : Usually, white push along the side here ... and play A. A is joseki ... and we can search why is it so important to play here ?
I'm not strong enought to explain it all ... but with white, i will be affraid of a black move at Q18]

(;B[oe]C[Is this the correct move in this situation?  Or would S15 or some other move be better?

xxc : S15 is better. It is important to prevent white from escaping along the side here ... and it is a sente.]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb]C[xxc : 2 times is enought here. White should have play on the other side one time S15 or S14. This gives sure live to the corner, destroy a part of the right side potential for black and reduce a little the power of the black wall.]

(;B[lb]C[xxc : black must play S15 ... but to go on here, just push on the second line, even the third line is good good.]
;W[la]TR[re][rf][qj][ck][dk][co][jp][jq]C[xxc : No needs to play here, it's a yose move.

The corner is safe now, it's better to play elsewhere and grab a big point]
;B[ka];W[ma];B[kc];W[re];B[rf]LB[do:A]TR[qk]C[xxc : difficult to stop white here. Contact moves are not attack moves ... and it is too late to prevent white from entering the side here.
A black stone arround the marked stop is good enought to stop white and work well with the lower corner

Black had a strong wall now ... and must play as far as possible from his wall.

A is a good point to start with.];W[hc]LB[cc:1][fc:2][ck:A]
[co:B]C[xxc : White have to play solid moves now and prevent black from having a too much large framework.

It's a dangerous move ... black can still play 1 or 2]
(;B[dg]C[xxc : Why not ?

But if we look at the whole board, all black groups are ok ... and there is a lonely white stone, attack here is a good idea.

If black want to play here ... C14 seems better];W[dj];B[fg]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[df];B[ef];W[ee];B[fe];W[fd];B[ge]C[xxc : This gives a big corner to white ... but now black can attack on the right side]
;W[gd]C[xxc : This is not important right now. Better to add a stone to help D10]

(;B[ic]C[xxc : A black stone arround here must close the framework ...

Until now, black wait for an invasion from white in order to attack the invader and make points elsewhere, but white didn't come in, so it is time to close the framework to made invasion harder.]

(;W[ib]C[xxc : This help black to close];B[id];W[jb]C[xxc : Small]

(;B[kb]C[xxc : This is too small.

It is time for black to make points now ... but be carefull a too large framework can let enought place in it to make a living group.]
;W[jc]C[xxc : of course white have to reduce now ... but not this way]
;B[jd];W[co]C[xxc : Yes, it's late, but still important.];B[ek]
C[xxc : To much presure on the white stones could be dangerous now ...]
;W[dk];B[el];W[dl];B[ei];W[lq]LB[lo:B][jq:A]C[xxc : This seems rather far from the corner ... black can chose, cut (A) or go on with his moyo (B)]
;B[mq]C[xxc : Remember that ... contact moves makes stones stronger ... use them only to defend and not to attack.]
;W[lp];B[lr]C[xxc : This help white to enter ...];W[jq];B[kr]
;W[jr]C[xxc : Now it is time for black to make points ... he had a large framework, but only a few points in the lower right corner.]

[nr][or][pr][qr][rr][sr][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[xxc : A nice game with not so much "horrible" moves ... it's good :)

This game point out some importants things we all encounter at the beginning.

The first one is << how to use thickness >>
In this game, black had a lot of thickness. He builds 3 walls, and looking at the game after move 49 it is like if black want to make a huge territory with his 3 walls.
But the best way to use thickness ... is to fight elsewhere, not to make territory (there is a proverb on this)

The second one is <<important and urgent>>
I can't really explain this, because of my low level. But one thing is sure and i point it out many times during the games, both players stay in a patern while bigger moves were elsewhere.
This is also difficult to manage ... often, when we start a patern or a fight, we go on untill the end, but it is a good thing to take a break, look at the whole board and ... and ... see where are the big moves.
One thing that help me a lot with this is pro games. Just following the flow of the game and discover that they really often let the stones and play elsewhere. To start with this, just look at your groups ... when a group is ok, no need to add a stone to make a few more points, the group is alive, let it as this. And surely you will find a better move on the goban.

The third thing is <<be carefull with moyo>>
Here we have a good exemple.
A moyo game is really difficult to manage. A small moyo and the game is lost, a too big one and it may be destroy by a living group.

The last thing is <<contact or not>>
We see this again many times in this game ... contact moves make stones stronger. The only way to take advantage is to take a little distance from the stones.
In this game it was really important when white start to invade, especially in the center, black do not succes in stoping the stones.

That's all. I hope you'll find some use with these comments.

I know, it's difficult to understand the power of the black shape here ... and it's difficult for me to explain it, but try to feel it ... each move from white should be far from this wall now ... and black just have to answer ... extending from his strong wall ... and give it more power.

If white play too near, black will push the stone toward his wall building an other wall to attack latter the rest of the board ... and perhaps kill the invasion.

And black can now invade everywhere ... and just flee toward his wall.

(This is a standar patern from 3-3 invasion)]))
