;B[pd]C[ACErose [27k\]: Ello and good game.];W[pp];B[ce]C[Archer7 [24k\]: Good luck
This was to prepare for an extension down the left side, and 
to see if she would invade early.];W[dq]LB[dc:A][co:B][do:B]
C[L: a corner enclosure and a corner approach is, all other things considered, equally big, thus A and B have the same priority, but here, B is better than A because this has to do with the development of your stones. Exactly which B I leave for the dans to decide.]

(;B[dc]LB[jc:B][co:A]C[L: A or around B are the only moves for White I'd consider...]
;W[pj]LB[jd:B][ck:C][co:A][do:A]C[L: A or B are the moves I'd consider. Approaching 3-4 before a side extension is seldom bad, but even if you are to do a side extension then extend in the direction of your corner enclosure (B). Your move at C... Is hard for me to judge. It might be just as good, I just don't know. (Though I would prefer a move at the fourth line.)]
;B[ck];W[co];B[jd];W[jp]LB[ph:A][qh:A][jj:B]C[L: I'd say Black is slightly ahead at this point. I'd consider A (normal) or B (zealous).]
;B[nc]LB[ee:A][pf:B][dj:C]C[L: Black solidifies his moyo too early... Now White plays B or A or C etc to reduce/erase it.]
;W[nq];B[ek]LB[ee:A][ph:B][dj:C]C[I think I was being overly conservative here. I was trying to avoid an invasion on the left, but left open the right, and let her create too large of a moyo.

L: Yes, no. When you play moyo games you must learn to love invasions. If your opponent invades first in a moyo game that means that you are LEADING, and if you can maintain your composure and keep an eye on why you really wanted an invasion in the first place, then you will definitely MAINTAIN that lead. The reason you want an invasion is that it basically lets you solidify and make lots of territory while attacking the invading stones... But back to the game... White wouldn't invade here, he would have played a shoulder hit at C to erase your moyo... He/she I think I am getting my pronouns mixed but you know what I mean. Anyway, that oppertunity is there for White since you played on the third line. Had it been on the fourth line, then maybe White would have to invade. And even after this White still has the option of A. I think you should've played B instead.]
;W[pf]C[L: Good point.];B[qf];W[qg];B[qe];W[ph]LB[jg:A][og:D]
[pn:B][no:C][gp:E]C[L: Here are some points for you to recognize. Personally, I prefer BUILDING stuff, so I'd play at A. Playing D first and then A would be very nice but White may just ignore D (even if it's very big). B is an invasion. C is kinda also an invasion but much lighter and you can aim for sabaki. E is also entirely possible though this area isn't the biggest.]
;B[on]C[I wanted to break up her moyo a bit, and leave myself with escape room to the center. I probably should have played at R6, in order to challenge the corner.

L: R6 is too low and this is too high. I would have played Q6.]
;W[qn]LB[qm:A][ln:B]C[L: Playing A or B is now possible.];B[mo]
;W[lq];B[nk]C[L: Black plays some weird shapes... But so does White :)]
;W[ol]LB[ll:C][ml:B][nl:A]C[L: A is too solid, too slow. Consider dodging with B or C. Remember that you just want to get out into the center so that your group is safe. That's it. You don't want to surround territory here...]
;B[nl];W[ok];B[om];W[pm];B[op];W[oq]LB[oo:C][op:A][oq:B]C[L: A was a forcing move. White responded with B. OK, mission accomplished, move on!! Don't play here again! This is very important to remember. Even IF White plays C... So what?? Then you ignore it and play elsewhere AGAIN and you got two free moves somewhere while White maybe takes one stone. Black gains 20 points and White gains 2 points.]
;B[np]C[L: Now white simply takes tenuki. You gave away the initiative because you were worried about a single stone.]
;W[mp];B[lp];W[mq];B[lo]LB[kk:A]TR[nk][nl]C[
L: Black is playing too solidly and too slowly. So many of the last moves should have been omitted. After he got the marked wall he should've just played A and be very happy.]
;W[kp];B[jn]C[Here I wanted to make certain that I could maintain my eyeshape for this group.

L: OK, here is a misconception you need to get rid of: when you play on the outside there is no "eyespace"... You just make sure you get into the center first. That's it. The group will be fine (if it isn't then you made a mistake later), I promise. When you play on the INSIDE (i.e. invasion), THEN you worry about eyespace etc. You played primarily to reduce, not invade, and then you should've just drawn back and waited to see what happens next.]
;W[ld]CR[fd][gd][fe][ge][ch][dh][ci][di]LB[ne:B][lf:A]TR[jd]
[jf][ih][hj]C[L: OK, when you see this, here is what you need to think about. You want to attack this stone in such a way that White allows you to naturally build a wall along the triangles, to enclose huge territories at either circled areas (you shouldn't need both).]

(;B[lf]C[L: Interesting move though. Very aggressive. But it seems a little "I am going to kill you" attitude. Killing invasions and the like is not something that normally happens in stronger players' games, even in low dan games... (Yet they don't "like" to invade!) That tells us something.]
;W[lh];B[lj]C[Again, trying to maintain eyeshape, but she was able to leverage quite a lot of territory inside of my space, were I didn't think she could. I was confused as to how to play.

L: You are way way too paranoid about this group. Even if White got like four free moves, she couldn't completely surround AND kill this group.]
;W[mf]LB[le:B][me:A]C[L: Well, if you still want to kill that stone, then A or B should do it.]
;B[kh];W[kf];B[jf];W[ke];B[kg];W[lg];B[je]C[L: This is great work. It's like you got an epiphany on what really matters here. :) White's invasion/reduction here is a failure because you got this great outside influence and will now most likely take huge territory on the left.]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[le];B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[mc];B[ne]LB[nd:A][ee:B]
C[Gaining eyespace, interfering with hers.

L: I think this move is a pass... You do not gain any "eyespace." Your eyespace is in your corner?? And it doesn't threaten her "eyespace" eitehr (she doesn't have any eyespace, she has 2 eyes (pretty much!) AND a connection to living stones... It doesn't threaten the connection either.]

(;W[nd];B[od];W[md];B[oc];W[oe];B[ni];W[nh]C[L: What just happened here, I don't know. :)]
;B[li];W[hd]LB[ge:B][gf:A]C[I didn't think much of H16, and yet it turned into such a fight.

L: yeah, this should be killable now. You can mostly improve here by learning to play "shapes"... I've included a lot of alternative moves.]

(;B[gf];W[fe]LB[ge:B][ff:A]

(;W[gc];B[fd];W[ib];B[hc]C[If she plays at J17, I'll extend to the top and catch her stones.]
;W[ic];B[hb]C[She does, and this worked out well for me. I felt good about the game at this point. I was controlling the upper right, most of the upper left, and much of the center.

L: The last couple of moves were pure desperation ;) There were probably a million different killing alternatives, but yes, the game is good.]
;W[dl]LB[dk:A][el:B]
(;B[dk];W[el]LB[np:A]C[L: White commits the same mistake you did by playing A... A hard and fast rule would be: don't "extend" slowly and solidly from a forcing stone. That's a sign you're treating that stone like something it is not...]
;B[fl]C[L: Now White's two stones are useless.];W[hm]LB[hl:A]
[fn:B]C[Here is where I feel that it started coming apart. Instead of pushing down at F7, I kept forming a line, allowing her to solidify her wall and control of the entire bottom.

L: F7 is too slow anyway. Jump! Besides, the BIG mistake in my eyes wasn't H8...]

(;B[hl];W[jm]LB[il:A][im:C][km:B][eq:D]C[L: Think about these two moves.]

(;B[km]CR[fp][gp][fq][gq]TR[ll][ml][lm][mm][nm][ln][mn][nn]
MA[hh][ih][jh][hi][ii][ji][hj][ij][jj][kj][ik][jk][kk]C[L: This is a huge "conceptual"/strategic mistake. You see the area with the triangles? THERE IS NO TERRITORY THERE!!! The sooner you realize this the sooner you will become stronger. Technically, you might be able to squeeze some points out of it, BUT you can NOT allow yourself to "see" black territory there! If white approaches you do most definitely not "protect" it like you're doing now. You should be HAPPY to let white enter this area, in return for blocking access elsewhere...

L: If thinking on a bigger scale, you can't allow yourself to "see" any territory around the X's either, IF you are allowed to "trade" the X-area, for the White circle-area. White's area there is much bigger!!]

(;B[il]C[L: Don't "hug" solid groups! Right HERE it doesn't do much but create lots of ko threats, but it's a principle for better play.]
;W[fm];B[fk];W[kn];B[ko];W[jo]LB[in:B][ln:A]
(;B[ln];W[in];B[kn]LB[jn:A]C[L: These kinds of moves... Well, let's just say it keeps you pretty much anchored at 25++ kyu level. :) When troubled stones are atari'd or threatened to be captured, these are the ones you care about: a) stones that cuts two eyeless groups, or b) prevents yr opponent from forming a huge territory somewhere, or c) enclosing big territory on your part. The A stone was and is and always will be absolutely useless, so if White took it while you got a free move elsewhere, hip hurrah!]

invade successfully. I also thought that she could not, but it 
happened right here.

L: The game is pretty much even here, but yeah, you should have been able to get something out of that corner/area. At least a ko. :) Way way earlier I mean. Besides, black could've won by a couple of points with better endgame, I think.]
;W[ci]LB[cg:B][ei:A]C[With my wall at one side and the edge of the board on the other, I thought that this invasion was nothing to worry about.

[cj][dj][ej][fj][gj][hj][ij][jj][kj][ak][hk][kk]C[L: OK, the only reason you lost this game, really, is that you failed to kill that insane kamikaze White invasion... Your standard mode of operation (blocking on the outside) is GOOD, I do not want you to stop doing that! That will make you a very fierce moyo-manufacturer / territory landlord when you get stronger! But, you just need to learn when you actually need a wall / outside influence and don't. If you don't, it's OK to play to kill (i.e. take away base etc). Like the way you handled White's invasion at A was very admirable and way above your level, so it shows you know some strategic concepts, but also, the way you were worried about the triangle-area instead of jumping into the square-area, that shows that your protectiveness about your own area is way too strong, which contradicts most higher-level strategic concepts. The thing here is... the triangle area is 9 points maybe. If you had gotten a LIVE stone at B, think about what that means: that means you had to be connected to the outside AND White had to surround you on the outside, so that's a reduction of at LEAST 15 points! Most likely a LOT more (20-25). So that's a matter of judging "size"...

L: Anyway, good luck. :) Do some problems so you can kill idiotic invasions like White's in this game, but not so many that you try to kill everything everywhere all the time or you'll forget what is important (the outside outside outside!).]
