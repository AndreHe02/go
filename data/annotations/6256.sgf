AB[pp][dp][jj][pd][dd]C[zesaucisse [8k\]: hi have fun
ekberg [13k\]: Hi

ekberg, to the reviewer: Thank you for reviewing this game!
I can not see any obviously bad moves before move 126 - but at that time I was already behind. So I must be blind for some fundamental flaws in my playing style. Please tell me what I do wrong and how I can get better!]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[pn];B[np];W[pj]C[Here you give your opponent an easy start, at handikap games you have to attack because you are strong at the board and try to disconnect white groups, here white have a connected group]
;B[dj];W[fp];B[dn];W[lq];B[iq]C[This kind of attacking moves is better!]
;W[lo];B[io]C[ekberg: I believe it's ok to cut and hunt the two weak white groups;
Oktay : Yes, this is a good idea];W[nn];B[ro];W[rn];B[gn]C[ekberg: overconcentrated?
Oktay : Not necessary at the moment, even if you don't play white do not have an easy way to go out]
;W[co];B[do];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]C[These moves are good also, you disconnect white]
;B[cn];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[qq]
(;B[qp];W[oq];B[pq];W[nq];B[rq]C[ekberg: Looks like a bad result for black, but white has invested two more stones in the lower right. I feel like the black group is alive, but am not sure.
Oktay : black is alive but white becomes so strong and connected outside, and this is not a good result for black here]
;W[df];B[fd];W[lc]
(;B[ld];W[oe];B[od];W[hc];B[ef]C[ekberg: I was going to exchange some territory for influence in the center. I don't know why I stick to that moyo thing - I always end up with much less territory than I thought, because I don't know how to use the moyo correct. Any tips?
Oktay : There is nothing wrong with trying to make moyo at the games, this is a choice of the player, to learn how to use moyo I suggest you to review pro games ( Games of Takemiya Masaki for example ) and if you play for moyo you must take care of your weak groups, if you have weak groups do not make moyo, if you want to make moyo do not make weak groups]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[fi];W[cd];B[hd]MA[mf][mg][mh][mi]C[ekberg: Maybe I gave him too much? Is this the losing phase of the game?

Oktay : Here you gave too much for a territory of which one of the doors is open]

;W[rd];B[nc];W[kb];B[mb];W[lb];B[ob];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[na]
C[ekberg: Luckily I have done a lot of life and death problems;

Oktay : All of these stones make only two points but !];W[pa]
;B[oa];W[je];B[jf];W[mf];B[lg];W[mg];B[lh];W[dc];B[jc];W[ic]
;B[id];W[jb]
(;B[ec]C[ekberg: F18 better?
Oktay : I don't think so this move is better then F18];W[de]
;B[ci];W[ed];B[ch]C[ekberg: More urgent to play on top? Should I split the two white groups even though they are alive?

Oktay : To seperate two groups which are alive is not good, it is not a sente move]
;W[gd];B[ge];W[gc];B[nf];W[of];B[ng];W[nh];B[mh];W[og];B[ok]
;W[mj];B[ml];W[nl]MA[km][jn][kn]C[ekberg: I had intended to sacrifice P9 to make N8 stronger. was that ok tactically?

Oktay : Although N8 stone seems to make a territory the territory has still one door open so it can not make too much points in the end]
