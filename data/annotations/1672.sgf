C[Dear reviewer,

I played White in this game. I believe I have problems with timing
(the right moves at the right time) in the opening and the middle
game.
Another problem is to evaluate the value (size) of a move and
keep sente.

I've put some comments which are partly my analysis of how I
could haveplayed better and my thoughts which lead to certain
moves
My comments are  preceeded by <thomas>
I hope these comments will help you to review this game..

Thank you very much for you time!

Thomas (tomjk)

Hi Thomas!
I'll try my best to give some (hopefully good) hints. I'll start
my comments with <M>.

I plan to use this stone for ensuing fights, since both players
play the 4-4 opening and this is an idication for me both players
intend to fight ...

An alternative which came to my mind was to play the splitting
attack at C10 (a).

<M> this move is very uncommon and i would not play it. may be
it's no real mistake, but it is not one of the best moves. (if
you want to play like this, your move nr. 6 should be on the
4th line).

possible moves are F17 or as you suggested C10 (maybe also D10),
which is actually not a splitting attack, but an invasion (splitting
attack means: to split two weak groups - and keep them weak;
after C10 black can easily build a secure base on both sides).
anyhow: C10 would be a good move!];B[nc];W[pf];B[pb];W[ic]LB[ld:a]
C[<thomas>
I wanted here to make a splitting attack. (a) and (b) are miai
for me, but of course the corner is now there for Black to be
taken ... maybe (a) was better?

<M> (just for the record: this again is rather called an invasion
than a splitting attack). after a move like 11 your first instinct
should be to take the corner by playing R17. this is (almost)
never bad!!!

once a strong player told me: you may choose not to take the
corner , but you should do this only if you have a good plan
at hand and know exactly where you want to take your profit.

the stone at 12 is not really attacking anything (black can play
L17 or R17 to defend his two stones; this is miai: so black could
play even tenuki), nor defending anything, nor building territory.
i think this move is a mistake.

possible moves: R17, C10/D10 or (if you want to build a moyo
on the right) O15.];B[qc];W[ne]LB[md:a][me:b][ld:c]C[<thomas>
My iIdea was not to defend the side, but to get the K10 stone
to work. Seems too slow though, looking at it now.
Maybe  (a), (b) or (c) would have worked better?
Any ideas?

<M> again my first instinct is to block black. to prevent him
from sliding any deeper into your area of influence on the right
- that means playing R16. if you do this, you shouldn't let black
play R 17 in the first place.   so maybe 14 is ok for building a moyo. (b) seems also possible.
i don't like (a) and (c). anyhow - this moyo is open at the bottom
(thus not so valuable).

before playing there, i'd play a move on the upper left fist:
F17! why? because it's sente for both sides! if you play F17
or opponent would almost surely answer with C14 (or something
similar), but if he plays G17 you must answer to defend your
stone at J17. after exchanging stones there, you could come back
and play at O15.];B[qh]C[<M> not good for black! your opponent gives you a  target for
an easy attack.];W[qj]C[<M>good.];B[oh];W[mg]C[<thomas>
Trying to make some good shape and put pressure on Black. Now
my K10 stone is useful ...

<M> you are right! that is why black 15 was bad.];B[oj];W[oc]
C[<M> why? black is safe, you can't cut there. you are also strong
enough, need no reinforcement.];B[ob]LB[oe:a]C[<thomas>
This exchange was probably not necessary. I thought it would
help to prevent a cut at (a)...

<M> there was no danger for your stones. this exchange helps
black more than white, but it's no big mistake either.]
(;W[qd]LB[qf:a][qg:b]C[<thomas>
This looks now to me outright wrong. It does not seem to do anything.
During the game I wanted to prevent Black from getting an eye
by threatening to connect underneath. But with this move Black
still gets an eye ... :(
That's why I think now a move at (a) or (b) would have been better.
(see also variation)

<M> hmmm...
you are right. 22 is not the move you have to play if you want
to kill black, because it leaves a little eye-space. playing from
the other side first (S11) maybe better. if black then plays
a move at the edge, trying to connect to the corner , you'll
keep his groups separated (maybe S15, but that depends on black's
move).
  BUT (!) you should use black's weakness rather to build outside
strength, then to kill. as long as you can push him around, you
are in control of the game. you can (1) transform part of your
moyo in secure territory and (2) build up influence while your
opponent gets next to nothing! let him
live small! good enough!];B[qf];W[pg];B[ph];W[qg]C[<M> i think S11 would be better.]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[ri];W[qk]C[<M> this move looks small to me.

if you want to prevent black from building a base on the side,
you must play S10. if you have already changed your mind, you
may play elsewhere. but this stone is not "working". he is not
doing much for you.];B[ol];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd]C[<thomas>
The J17 stone is now a little bit too close, but that cannot
be helped here. Any other way for White to respond here?

<M> this white move is perfectly OK. you may wish now that the
stone at J17 would be at K17, but that is not much of a difference.]
;B[df];W[on]LB[mi:a][cj:b]C[<thomas>
Trying to keep the pressure on the Black group.
Maybe (a) better? Or is it time now for a move around C9 (b)?

<M> trying to keep pressure is a good idea. i think you are playing
from the right direction. 36 looks much better to me than (a).

playing on the left is also good (after the exchange on the upper
left, you should play C9 instead of C10 now!). but i think 36
is more urgent. i like that move.];B[mi];W[mo]LB[lq:a]C[<thomas>
The idea is to try to get some strength in order to attack Black
more severely ... but maybe not good here, since I loose the
possibility to play at (a)?

<M> as i said before: you should not aim at killing the black
group. you should rather push against the weak group to build
up strength to attack/invade at the bottom. = same idea that
you had, but different target.

but there is a problem. if you invade around (a) as long as your
corner is open, black can answer by playing R3 and making live
there. then you loose as much as you gain. so maybe you should
play P3 or P2 first. if black answers you have a big corner and
sente to play on the left (C9). if he does not answer, you can
use your power on the lower side.];B[lq];W[ch]C[<M> C9 is better. now a pincer at C10 is (i) attacking your stone
and (ii) working nicely with the hoshi at the lower left. if
i was black, i'll play C10 without hesitation.];B[cg]C[<M>not good for black. now (!) your stone at C12 is OK (with
some help from black ;-)];W[dh];B[kc]C[<M> black should rather play C8 or C9 now.]
;W[md]LB[cl:a][cm:b][cn:c]C[<thomas>
I don't know what I thought here.
Looking at it now, I feel playing at (a), (b) or (c) is urgent
now.
Any suggestions?

<M> suggestions? i suggest you follow your own advice and play
(a) (rather not b or c) :-)];B[ff];W[ee]C[<M> you can not cut there. if you just push around, black will
have more profit than you. play elsewhere!];B[ef];W[de];B[ce]
;W[cc]LB[db:a]C[<thomas>
Better at (a) I think ...

<M> better not to invade the corner. if you wanted to do so,
you shouldn't play 46 and 48. but first to play outside and strengthen
your opponent and then invade seems not so good to me.

it's also a question of attitude. many week players (including
me - unfortunately) - and some strong players too - won't let
the opponent have anything. they play left AND right, on the
outside AND in the corner.

but in GO you have to give and take (you left, your opponent
right; you outside, your opponent the corner). the day i really
learn this i'll be at least two stones stronger!

so think twice! do i really want/need that corner? if the answer
is yes, then ou must be prepared to give something else away.
if you need to invade the corner, C17 seems ok to me.];B[cd]

(;W[dc]LB[ed:a]C[<thomas>
Better at (a) instead or probably better to play elsewhere for
the time being. For example the D12 group could need some help
... ;-)

<M> locally, i'd play E18 (see variation). globally, i think a
move around D8/D9 is most important for both sides.];B[eb];W[ed]
;B[bc];W[fb];B[cb];W[kd]C[<thomas>
I wanted to close off this side and connect my groups ...

<M> i understand that you want to do something there (although
playing on the lower left is urgent for some time now). your
group looks heavy (lots of stones without good eye-shape). but
to do this you'll better not attach, because that makes your
opponent stronger. what about J15 or K15?];B[lc]C[<M> black could play K16 now, followed by M16. that would cause
white some troubles.]
(;W[mc]LB[jd:a]C[<thomas>
Better at (a) now to finish the job of closing this side. - see
variation

<M> yes, i agree.];B[mb];W[ld]LB[jd:a]C[<thomas>
Maybe better at (a)?

<M> both seem possible.];B[ll];W[cn]C[<thomas>
I decided it was time to do something on this side ...

<M> finally!! Although this may be an over-extension (=too far).]
;B[dn]C[<M> OK. your opponent doesn't want to fight there (with his strong
position in the upper corner, this would have been possible),
but rather make territory on the lower side.];W[dm];B[en];W[co]
;B[cp];W[go]C[<thomas>
I wanted to play here in order to avoid a big territory for Black.

<M> remember what i said about playing right AND left? if you
are not prepared to give something to your opponent, you are
likely to end up with week groups on both sides.];B[em]LB[go:70]
C[<M> good. black is reducing the white territory, and the white
70 is getting weaker.];W[dl];B[fp]C[<M> now this seems a little coward. i'd first push once more
with E8 (which i think is sente) an then play something like
J6 or H7.];W[hp];B[in]C[<M> better to play it earlier.];W[io]
;B[jo];W[hn];B[hm];W[gm];B[im];W[gl];B[el];W[hk]C[<thomas>
I had the "feeling" that I should bring my group out into the
open, even if this meant danger for my side group ...

<M> yes, i agree. that is why i think that white 70 was not so
well timed. i think first you should have solidified your group
on the left and then reduce black (if it is still possible).]
;B[dk]C[<M> painful for white.];W[ck]C[<thomas>
I was ready to give up the two stones at D8 ...];B[cj];W[bk]
;B[bj];W[dj];B[ek];W[bm];B[di];W[ej];B[ei];W[fj];B[ci];W[bp]
C[<thomas>
Was not sure if my group was alive...

<M> yes. if you play tenuki, B5 could be painful!];B[bq];W[ao]
;B[cr]C[<M> again, seems a little coward. better A3.];W[oq]
C[<M> good! reducing somewhere around H2 seems also big.];B[or]
;W[pr];B[op];W[pq];B[np];W[oo]LB[nn:a]C[<thomas>
Here I thought very long. I wanted to make a move which connects
the N5 stone and close also off the corner. I just found this
move which does just close off the corrner ... I think (a) would
have been the right move?

<M> i think 108 is good. saving your stone at N5 is not important!!
if black cuts off this stone you'll play H2 (or something there),
which is twice as big.];B[ln];W[nm]C[<M> not important! H2 is biggest!!]
;B[nl]C[<M> also very small.];W[mn];B[gq]C[<M> Finaly.];W[hq]
;B[re]C[<M> not as big as the lower side.];W[qe];B[rd];W[pc]
;B[rb]
(;W[sg]LB[kq:a][fi:b]C[<thomas>
I realized immediately that this was way too small for a middle
game move. I believe this is where I lost the game.

A move at F11 (a) and then L3 (b)  would have been far better
... see variations.
I think F11 is nearly sente...
Black later in the game gets to capture the E10 group. So move
F11 here makes in this game actually makes difference of about
20 points...

Are there any other big sente moves for White here?

<M> well, according to my calculation, white is already 15 points
behind. so this is not the losing move. but you are right: 120
is not the biggest (for the record: endgame-move; the middle
game is already over). you are right about F11. this is big and
almost sente, but it's not 20 points! you play F11, black answers
E10 or F10. this is about 8 points! anyhow 8 points in sente
is a move that you should play now. L3 is not as big. you made
a mistake for black in one variation (see my comment there).
you can gain some points there, but i would not me necessary
sente. H2 seems one of the biggest now (threatening to reduce
left and right). a move around K13/J13 seems also interesting,
but may be gote. with correct endgame of black, i think white
lost already.];B[jd]
(;W[he]C[<M> since white is clearly behind, i think he must fight harder
now. with K17 things get difficult. i simply don't know if it
is possible to capture black (see variation)! it's not a move
i would not advice, if white would be leading, but now i think
white has to try something.

anyhow: cut might also end up in a disaster! so K17 would be
rather an act of desperation, but IF (if...!) you could capture
121 on large scale, you would be back in the game.];B[jc];W[ib]
;B[jf];W[ie];B[je];W[hg];B[fi]C[<M> a pity that black got that move.]
;W[ih]C[<thomas>
This was the only moe I saw to connect.

<M> that's ok.];B[jr]C[<M> good.];W[hr];B[gr];W[lp];B[kq];W[lm]
C[<M> not really big. but what is big now? maybe S10. or G10. E19
and S12 or not so big, but sente.];B[km];W[mm];B[kl];W[ml]C[<M> i don't think that there is a cut. black can connect his
stones to the top group or to the bottom group. i think you can
gain nothing there. sente is good, but playing a move just because
it's sente is not good enough.];B[mk];W[lk];B[lj];W[kk];B[kj]
;W[jk];B[kh];W[kn];B[jn];W[ko];B[kp];W[lo]C[<M> now with the whole sequence from 140 to 152 you gained two
points, but black also got at least that much in the right center.]
;B[nr];W[il];B[ps];W[qs];B[os];W[rr];B[rl];W[rm];B[pm];W[pl]
;B[om];W[pn];B[pk];W[ql];B[nj];W[pj];B[ok];W[ng]C[<M> small. S12 is bigger. G10 is bigger. K7 is bigger. and G1
is small, but - i think - sente.];B[gj]C[<M> that hurts.];W[fk]
;B[gk];W[hj]C[<M> if you need to play this, you should not play 172 in the
first place.];B[fl];W[hl];B[jm]C[<thomas>
Now the game is over for White.
The game was played up to the end and  Black won by 9.5 points.

<M> yes. black is leading 20 points. if you got it down to 9.5,
you made a good micro-endgame.

now what's the conclusion? i think in tactics, you have been easily
as good as your opponent. your big mistakes have been a matter
of attitude. you have been so busy taking this from your opponent
and taking that from you opponent, that you hardly ever developed
you own positions. black was building up territory and you wanted
to take it away.  what happened was, that you ended up with almost
no territory of your own, but a lot of weak groups. and although
black made some coward moves, he finally got some good attacks
(like an the left side).

i think if you could be a little more patient and a little more
constructive instead of destructive (which also means: let your
opponent have some territory, as long as you got an equal big
territory yourself), you could become maybe two stones stronger.

good Luck for the future,
