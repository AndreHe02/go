C[Hi
 I am Dieter. I'm 2d in Belgium and a 4d? on KGS. My comments are preceded by "dv"

The theme of this review is "foreseeing the direction of play"]
;B[pc];W[dp]C[AthensOhio [2k\]: hi, have a good game!
MicaelS [1k?\]: thanks, you too];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo]
;W[cn];B[dr]C[dv: There is a problem with this move. It is not a big mistake, but big enough to matter at the high dan level. Black loses the option of invading the corner and commits himself to capturing the White stone. The move has a "heavy" flavour.]
;W[kq]C[dv: White should just play 3-3];B[cq]TR[cn][dp][fp]
[eq][gq][hq]SQ[fq][dr][er][fr]C[dv: Now it is White who suffers, compared to the joseki. For reference, in one of the joseki, WHite has all the triangle poitns and Black the squares. Black is closed into the corner, White has influence outside. Here, White is separated and Black has the corner. Black is better.]
;W[ck];B[fc];W[pe]
(;B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pf];B[nc];W[pj]LB[fc:A]TR[nc]C[dv: I think Black chose the wrong joseki here, because A now tries to develop from a low position.]
;B[cf];W[ee]
(;B[ci]LB[cc:B][bd:A]C[dv: Exchanging 1 for B first is probably better. See variation.]
;W[qn];B[nq];W[rp];B[qq];W[nn]TR[ck][cn][hq][kq]SQ[fo]C[dv: We can see that Black has taken three corners, one corner is open (I would defintitely take it, being Black) and White doesn't really make an overwhelming moyo in the centre. The white 2-space extensions are too meagre and Black's squared 1-space-jump is shining brightly.]
;B[qj]CR[if][jf][kf][lf][mf][nf][ik][jk][kk][lk][mk][nk]LB[ih:F]
[jh:D][kh:E][lh:C][mh:B][nh:A]TR[rh][qi][qk][rl]SQ[pg][ph][pi]
[pk][pl]C[dv: very likely this is a good time to invade.

This kind of decision needs A LOT of consideration. You have to think how the game might progress, not just "we'll destroy that potential territory and we'll see what happens after"

1) Do I want to live (triangles) in exchange for a strong White wall?
2) Do I want to run at the letter points, while White runs at the circled points.]
;W[qk]
(;B[pk]C[dv: the crosscut is dangerous]
(;W[ql];B[pi];W[oj];B[oi];W[ni];B[nj];W[ok];B[nk];W[ol];B[nh]
;W[mi];B[qh];W[mh];B[ng]C[dv: It is dangerous for White to push Black over the weakened stones. Are you prepared to sacrifice them?]
;W[ne]C[Apparently not ...];B[mf]C[dv: So Black now happily continues his attack.]
;W[me];B[lf];W[le]
(;B[lk]LB[ng:A][nj:B]TR[le][me][ne][pe][pf][qf]SQ[mh][mi][ni]
C[dv: Unfortunately, Black now loses focus. It is the triangeled group which should be harassed, not the squared one. The group A cuts weak from relatively weak. Group B cuts relatively weak from strong !!! So it is cut A which need persistence, not B.]
;W[ki];B[jk];W[kf]C[dv: Suddenly, Black's important cutting group comes under attack.]
;B[kg];W[jf];B[lg];W[jg];B[jh];W[ji];B[ih]C[MicaelS [1k?\]: would you care for review?]
;W[ii];B[kh];W[hi];B[hh]C[AthensOhio [2k\]: sure!
AthensOhio [2k\]: but the game's not yet over :)
MicaelS [1k?\]: no
AthensOhio [2k\]: but yes, review is a great way to get stronger. let's make time for it]
;W[gh]LB[jd:B][hf:A]C[dv: Again, White pushes Black over his weak group. He might be interested in defending himself instead, at A or B. In such running fights, if all groups are into open space, it is difficult to attack them. Any direct attack might help the opponent.]
;B[hf]LB[hk:A];W[gd];B[gg];W[fh]
(;B[fg]TR[dd][gd][hd][ee][ie][ei][dj][ck]SQ[cf][dg][eg][gg]
[ch][ci]C[dv: I think Black now concentrates on reaching the other side. I understand that, but I think it is better to concentrate on cutting of White's weak group. 

In our minds we must think about the drawn result. White's triangled groups connect, Black's squared group too. Is this what we want?

See variation.];W[eg]
(;B[ef]C[dv: Must be the other cut. See var.]
(;W[ff];B[df]C[MicaelS [1k?\]: I atari wrong way
AthensOhio [2k\]: we'll see
AthensOhio [2k\]: B still has problems

dv: Yes the atari was wrong. See var.];W[ei]C[MicaelS [1k?\]: sure]
;B[fe];W[fd]C[dv: good sacrifice];B[ge];W[he];B[gf];W[ie]C[... and Black has accomplished little. Again, I understand reaching the other side seemed to be good when conceived.

dv: White now definitely has the better position.];B[kc];W[hl]
C[Good.];B[km];W[lo];B[in];W[im];B[mm]LB[jn:A]C[dv: simply A]

;W[mn];B[ip];W[ic];B[fm];W[bd];B[bf]LB[lj:A][rj:B][iq:C]C[dv: This is small. Black has many options for this group (A & B), so no fears. C is big now.]
