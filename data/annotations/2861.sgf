;W[cn]C[question 1: is white correct ? it seems that he strengthens my bottom border ?



NM: Nothing wrong with this - of course he'll strengthen your bottom border, but he makes territory on the side.]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp];W[cj];B[qf]C[question 2: is black correct ? or i should play "a" first ?



NM: I would have played this. P4 is on too small a scale.];W[nd]
;B[pj];W[og]C[NM: Good!];B[rd]C[NM: Not good. W should reply somewhere like R12 and he can force B to live small in the corner.]
;W[qc]C[NM: .... but rhia is just the reply B should have been hoping for.]
;B[of]C[NM: Better the simple Q12.];W[nf];B[pg];W[oh];B[ph]
;W[mh]C[NM: I would play O10 here.];B[oi];W[ni];B[nj];W[mj]
;B[nk];W[mk];B[ml];W[kk];B[kl];W[jl];B[km];W[hl]C[question 3: building the pattern in this way seems disadvantage to black, but i cannot think of the better moves.



NM: It's reasonably balanced. B's area is nearly territory - with a single play at P3 it's unattackable - while W;s is bigger but looser.]
;B[ic]C[question 4: should black place here ? or "a", "b" or somewhere else ?



NM: No, this is best - unless B decides to reinforce his territory first with something like J5.]
;W[io]C[NM: Nearly sente, and then he can come back to defend. And W still has some possibilities

to invade...];B[hq];W[dj]C[NM: Not good. This is in no danger of attack, so D10 is too small. I would play L17, expecting B to play F17, and then play E17.]
;B[cc]C[question 5: should i place here ? or there is a better way ?



NM: This is dubious. The danger is that if W closes it in firmly you may have difficulty making J17 live. I would have played M17 or F17. However, it is tricky for W to separate the two stones, so it's playable for B.]
;W[cd]C[NM: I would have closed B in on the other side, hoping to kill J17 - but I grant you that doesn't look easy.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc]C[NM: This could be an occasion for the double hane.]
;B[fb];W[gc];B[ed]C[NM: Terrible! This stone should die, and you have lost the chance to connect to J17.]
;W[gb];B[ee];W[cf];B[ie]C[question 6: is it a correct way to capture white ? or some better tesuji ?



NM: You cannot capture W if he plays correctly - e.g. G15 now.]
;W[ff];B[ef];W[fd]C[NM: Bad. SHould be G15, G14, or even F13.]
;B[fg];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf];B[ig]C[NM: And W has got out even with not the best plays.]
;W[ch]C[NM: Not necessary, W should break through at H13.];B[eg]
;W[if]C[dog fight begins...];B[jf];W[hg];B[hh];W[ih]C[NM: W should play K13 then K15.]
;B[jg];W[gh];B[hi];W[ib];B[jb];W[fa];B[db];W[bc]C[NM: B18 would kill B.]
;B[bb];W[bd];B[ea]C[NM: Should be C19 to try and live in ko.]
;W[ga]C[NM: Terrible! W must play C19.];B[ca];W[ab];B[ba]C[NM: Now that the B group lives W will have difficulty. His best chance is probably K18]
;W[je];B[id];W[hb]C[NM: SHould be L15];B[ke];W[jc];B[jd]C[NM: SHould be K17.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[ja]C[NM: Should be M17.];B[lc];W[ka];B[lb];W[la]
;B[nb]C[NM: Good];W[hd];B[fe];W[he];B[ge];W[rc];B[np]C[white surrender.



NM: Fair enough.])
