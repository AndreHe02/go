C[Hi,this is the first game i played as a first dan as white vs another first dan on IGS. I did not play very well, please point out any of my stupid mistakes so i may improve in my next game. Thanks alot!

[EV\] Reviewer comments will be marked this way.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[dh];B[ec];W[eb];B[ed];W[fb];B[cc];W[cb]
;B[dd];W[db];B[be]LB[bc:A]C[[EV\] The normal joseki continuation is A, which establishes a better base in the corner.]
;W[bc]C[[EV\] Good.];B[gd];W[nq]CR[ck][dk][cl]C[i have already benefitted from the upper left corner

[EV\] B compensation for the corner loss is thickness facing the left side.  W could completely negate that thickness by establishing a safe side position with a move at one of the marked points.  B in turn should be looking for a chance to play a pincer on the left, making use of the existing thickness.  Because a move here affects the efficiency of many other stones, it is at least as big as a corner approach move.  I won't say this move is bad, particularly if you like a fighting game, but keep the left side in mind.]
;B[pn];W[no]C[[EV\] Normal fuseki priority is to extend along the side first, then perhaps come back later to a move like this.  Switching the order gives B an opportunity to split the bottom side before W can stake out a base there.  A move like this might be playable if W is jumping ahead of B each move (or B is pushing from behind, looking at it the other way), but that is not the case here.]
;B[oq];W[nr];B[iq]C[[EV\] Good play by B.  The W stones to the right cannot develop efficiently now.]
;W[gq];B[mp];W[op]C[is this move a mistake? my original intention was to cut up black's weak left stones, but unfortunetely it backfired on me.

[EV\] Yes, this move is a serious mistake, probably the game losing move.  W must just connect, staying strong to attack the invading B stones.  If W plays patiently here, he can look for a chance to take the corner later with R3..]
;B[np];W[oo];B[qq];W[or];B[pq];W[lq];B[lp];W[kq];B[kp];W[jq]
;B[mn]C[[EV\] B should push once more to get the most out of the stone at J3.  Still, this result is good for B.]
;W[jp]C[an un-neccesary sacrifice, but i got the big corner..

[EV} The lower right territory and thickness put B in the lead now.  The lower left corner is not secure W territory yet, and the W bottom territory is smaller than the B lower right territory plus thickness.]
;B[cl]C[[EV\] Good move.  Hard to say just which point is best here, but splitting the side is the right idea.]

(;W[cn]C[[EV\] This is a good fighting move, but it does not quite secure the corner.  If B later invades at C3, he probably gets a ko.]
;B[dj];W[fh];B[eg]C[[EV\] This peep is from the wrong side.  Forcing W to connect makes the weak B stones on the left side even weaker.  Better to keep the aji in reserve.  (Sometimes a peep like this is used force the opponent into a fixed heavy attackable shape, but here this seems premature, as it is not clear that the W stones are weaker or more attackable than the B stones.)

[EV\] Also, B should be wary of some other possible W responses (see variations).]

(;W[eh];B[fj];W[el]C[i realized i should have used the decoy stone to run my other three stones out, but i was too greedy for territory

[EV\] The first priority in a running fight like this should be to take care of weak stones which cannot be sacrificed.  If this move was designed to interfere with the shape of the B stones in the fight above, then it has some merit, although just running oout with the three W stones seems safer.  But if this move is designed as a sacrifice to make territory below, it is a bad idea.]
;B[dm];W[dn];B[em];W[en];B[fl];W[fn];B[hh]C[my three stones are as good as gone

[EV\] This is a terrible result for W.   The corner gain (maybe 20 points) does not come close to the loss from making the weak B group  secure and nearly killing the weak W group.  The game should be over now.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd];W[qd];B[qc];W[pe]
(;B[rd];W[od];B[qe];W[pc]
(;B[oc];W[qd]C[a good chance for a comeback, i tried to create a ko in vain

[EV\] This ko is enormous.  W should be happy to get a chance here, since B had an easy win by simply playing safe.]
;B[mq]C[[EV\] This is a horrible ko threat, losing a crucial liberty.  The W cutting stones are no longer dead after W answers.]
;W[mr];B[pd];W[fm]C[[EV\] B leads by enough before this ko that W has no big enough threats to stage an upset, while B does have threats big enough to win..]

(;B[gl];W[qd];B[jo]C[[EV\] The ko is much larger than any of the ko threats on either side.  W could ignore this threat, as B has no fatal continuation (see variations).  Unfortunately for W, it looks like B would still win.]

;W[br];B[pd];W[al];B[bj];W[qd];B[nc]C[black don't have much ko threats left

[EV\] Or maybe B counted and realized this was enough to win.]
;W[re];B[pb];W[rc];B[pd];W[jn];B[ln];W[pc];B[qb]C[[EV\] The game is really over now.  I have a few more comments on technique, but nothing which affects the outcome.]
;W[ne];B[me]CR[hc]C[won the ko, now looking to break rest of black's huge upper and right territory

[EV\] This move is in the wrong direction.  The upper side is open at at the marked point (H17), so it takes two moves for B to make territory here.  Getting in the first move on the right side would be a large gain with a single move.]
;W[mf];B[le]C[stupid move there, made black stronger i think?]
;W[pj]C[[EV\] Good try.];B[oh];W[ph]C[[EV\] Too easy on B.  The following sequence is forced and gives W very little.  W needs to capture both B stones to have any chance.]
