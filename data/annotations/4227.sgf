AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hi!

My name is Tomasz Zalewski and I am 4 kyu at IGS. This is really awkward situation for me to comment a game where pro has played...]
;W[fc];B[df];W[nc];B[jp];W[qf];B[oe];W[qh];B[qj]C[I would play around N16 now. With a big handicap you should attack. R10 does not put a big pressure on W (he can always extend to R16) nor secures territory. Strengthening P15 and Q16 is more important IMHO.]
;W[oh]C[Now you have problems with your 2 stones above];B[md]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[I think the block should be from the other side. W will get some territory anyhow. With Block at R16 you build your wall in front of W group below. You gain nothing. I you block at Q17 you get some territory and secure living. 



I know it is hard to leave some territory to opponent (probably that's the reason behond R16), but you have to learn it.]
;W[pc];B[rc]C[If you have to play here, I would suggest S17. Almost as powerfull, and you don't have to answer after W's S17. But you can play somewhere else. O13 looks like the begonning of a good shape.]

C[I think this whole fighting sequence was unnecesary. You should escape to the center ASAP.



Anyway - M15 would give you much better shape. This is heavy. 



Also I get a feeling some stronger players would recommend more artistic shape - M14.



Remember, good shape is the one that gives you some eye opportunities. This one - does not.]
;W[kc];B[ke];W[pn];B[np]C[I think you should support the group around Q10. First - it is lots of territory. Second - W will attack right group to strengthen attack on upper one, or attack upper to attack powerfully right one.]
;W[id]
(;B[if]C[Cut in K16 gives more opportunities];W[mg]C[That's right - both groups in danger.]
;B[mj];W[kg];B[lf]C[Is this a bad move (44)? wanted white to join at A then play at B.

I am sorry, but I cannot see A and B point on the board...

But I am pretty sure you should connect in K14 or K15];W[mi]
;B[lj]C[I do not know what you try to gain with this move. 
- M10 puts no pressure on W group above
- Does not secure anything below - this is noman's land because of Q6

I think you should play around O7:
- influence left of N10-O4 line
- pressure on W stone at Q6
- connecting Q10-R10 stones];W[nj];B[nk];W[ok];B[oj];W[ni];B[ol]
;W[mk];B[nl];W[ml]C[This sequence took advantage of weak position of Q10-R10]
;B[nn];W[je]C[Now my Black group is in trouble. How to get out? Can I get out with a Ko at the right side?

It is really hard to look at all the possibilities. I wold see your chance in getting away via right edge. We will see variations later.]
;B[lg];W[kh];B[rg];W[rf]
(;B[sf]C[Why not R13?];W[qg]
(;B[jj]LB[sh:A]C[I think I should have played at A to get out with a Ko instead of making a move at 64


Again - this ko is worthless. There's no eye at T13, T15 and S16. W will play S11 and you have nowhere to escape. 

But I think S11 would results in important ko.];W[ki];B[kj]

Nope];B[rj];W[jf];B[dn];W[hq]

Do not be afraid of invasions in san-san when you have so much influence in this area. Invasion in sansan would give you beaufiful walls.]

The final thought: 

You are too much focused on territory. You have lost because you tried to spoil your opponents territory and you created a weak group.

One weak group - is opportunity for your opponent.
Two - you have problem
Three - you are dead.

I have lost many games because of this...])
