C[this is a game from KGS.  i am black 8k and opponent is 7k, 0.5 komi.

i have a few specific questions about things i can't figure out reviewing the game on a net-vs-ladder in the lower left, then fighting in the lower right, then correct strategy at one point, and then big fighting in the middle.  however, i also am interested in any general tips, especially for what to keep in mind in fighting like this

thank you];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[hq];B[qo]C[in the past i have played C3 or F5 here but after one of my games i found out that R5 is also popular and i wanted to try it

Yes, You are right, but only if you use it with another stone around L3]

C[i wanted to play the C4 ladder or the C5 net if it worked.  at the time i thought the net just barely worked.  but maybe not, or maybe the net works but leads to such a complex semeai that it has even more bad aji than the ladder?


The net is worse aji, always make safe the corner];W[lq];B[jq]
C[i was concerned that M3 makes my earlier R5 pointless so i thought i had to try fighting here

I fell to weak move at the moment];W[jp];B[kp];W[kq];B[jo];W[ip]
;B[io];W[ho];B[hn];W[fo];B[en];W[gn];B[im];W[hm];B[in]C[i thought it was ok to make this empty triangle since i would likely have to anyway after bL5 wM4


Yes, I think the same. Still is important use your lower right corner to support this stones and build influence in the upper bottom direction]
;W[hl];B[df];W[ch];B[il]C[i still didn't like the possibility of wJ8 with wL5 possible

I agree];W[cf];B[ce];W[de];B[cg];W[bf];B[dg];W[bg];B[cc];W[cd]
;B[bc];W[bd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[da];W[cb]C[i was happy with wC18 because i thought white was wasting a ko threat]
;B[bb];W[ck]C[This is a moment to  value the board...

In that way you should play aroun K16 or Q10];B[ed];W[fc];B[ee]
C[i was glad i was able to block white here

You cant block with weak group (E16)];W[ef]
(;B[dh];W[ff]C[i thought i would be able to get compensation on the left in this possibility.  not sure if that was correct thinking though

The right compensation was using E15, see the variation];B[ci]
;W[bh];B[dj];W[el];B[fm];W[dk];B[gl];W[hk];B[gm];W[fn];B[em]
;W[ik];B[ko]C[should have tried to connect my D12 and G8 groups?  i was worried we would end up crosscut and then my D12 would be weakest given that white's C9 group has better threats (connection to B12, wD7 threatening wD5)

Yes, you shold... D12 gives a larger territory to white];W[fj]
C[In general you maybe should be consistent with you choices... I mean, try to save every stone usually put you in troubles. 

See the variation]

;W[gj];B[hj];W[jk];B[ii];W[bk];B[jh]C[i thought this was the best way to not have to worry about wH12 and to make sure that the white H9 group didn't threaten my L5 group

The proverb says "Connect your weak groups"];W[np];B[nr];W[lk]
;B[ks];W[jr];B[jd]C[i wasn't sure the correct strategy at this point

Right, You have a fight against K9, and your weaker is J5, because has less exits than G11]

;W[nm];B[on];W[lo];B[lp];W[mp];B[kn]C[i was happy with this squeeze]
;W[mo];B[kl];W[kk];B[nl];W[li];B[mq]C[Bigger at P10, remember. Is about territory, not stones]
;W[oq];B[or];W[pp];B[op]C[Now R4 instead];W[oo];B[po];W[qp]
;B[nq];W[op]
(;B[qq]C[i think this was a huge mistake and i should have squeezed again (variation)]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]
(;B[qs]C[another huge mistake right?  variation kills and this doesn't?

Right];W[rr];B[om];W[qr];B[pr];W[ps];B[lr];W[kr];B[ms];W[os]
;B[sp];W[rs];B[sq];W[so];B[sn];W[sr];B[so];W[js];B[ls]C[this is necessary now right?  so now i haven't killed and ended in gote!  should i have taken sente and allowed a ko?

Depends of your style... based in my reading of you and the opportunities (like B15,  J3 or more risky M12) maybe better allow the ko]

yes, is the worst, you not are allow to lose a move in this point]
