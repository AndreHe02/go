C[Edenz: This is a game between two weak players (~26k) on KGS, myself playing white.

I'm
very unhappy with the development at the beginning of the game. I feel, that
white ended up with a weak position while giving black solid territory. Or
perhaps, white's position is fine and I just can't appreciate its strength.

I'm
mostly interested in comments of the first 50 moves of that game. Please
see the comment at move 45, where I didn't know how to go on.   After move
50, black used the wrong strategy and got completely destroyed for it. I
don't think it's worth spending much time on that part.

Ted: I'm Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing the game for you.  My remarks will be preceded by my name.]
;B[cp];W[pq];B[cd];W[pd]C[Ted: If you want to play your two white stones this way, it might be better to play the 4-4 stone first -- especially when playing this way from the Black side.  The reason is that if you have Black and intend to play at, say, Q16 and Q3, White can respond with Q16 if you first play Q3, stopping you from getting the shape you want.]
;B[dj];W[eq]C[Ted: I think this is a good idea.  Black's first moves seem a bit unorthodox, and you've approached early.]

;B[ip]C[Ted: The empty triangle is bad, as the proverb goes.  Black really should have split you here by playing at J3.]
;W[iq];B[dq];W[er];B[go];W[bs]LB[ed:B][qk:A]C[Ted: It's much too early to play the monkey jump.  Your group is already stable, and there are much bigger points to play -- something around R9, and something around E16.]
;B[br]C[Ted: Black obliges you by responding.  Black should ignore this and either approach (in the O17 area), or play around R10.]
;W[cr];B[ar];W[cq];B[bq];W[dr];B[dp];W[ed];B[dc];W[ec];B[db]
C[Ted: Black is kind to you again.  D14 would be the standard move (and makes invading more difficult), while something around K16 would make you squirm.]
;W[eb];B[ee];W[id];B[jj];W[lk]TR[pd][pq]C[Ted: I can understand your wanting Black not to get too much territory in the center, but I think something in the R9 area is still bigger.  Note that Black can comfortably play betweein the two stones on the right and make a living territory.]
;B[jk];W[lm];B[jm];W[ge];B[ef];W[gg];B[fg]LB[qk:A]TR[pd]C[Edenz:
Here I was completely lost. My rough estimate on settled territories  gave
black 60 points for the 4 first rows on the left side and 20 points for the
area around H8 while white had 45 points on the 3 bottom rows and 15 points
around  G17.  In the area  on the right side  I thought, I'll get as much
territory as black will, which left me well behind.

However, I had no clue how  to solidify the right side in my favor and to protect against  invasions.

Ted: You have sente, which you should use to play in the R9 area!  It's by far the biggest part of the board.  If you can play there, you shouldn't be so bad off.  Black should be able to invade between R9 and the stone at Q16, but while Black does this, you can get a good position on the other side of his group.  I also think that in your analysis, you've failed to take into account that you'll either get more on the top than you accounted for, or else will get a good amount of territory in the top right corner.  Given White's having sente, I'd prefer White's position.]
;W[gh]C[Ted: This is much too small!];B[lo]C[Edenz:
I don't think, that was the right thing to do for black.  While black tried
to push through, it allowed me to settle the area on the left side. I think
the rest of the game was a very un-inspiring infight where black managed
to destroy himself.

What would have  been for black a good strategy to make white's life miserable? An invasion around R10?

Ted: Yes!  And you should have played there on your previous move (or any of a bunch of moves earlier) in order to make it difficult for Black to invade.]
