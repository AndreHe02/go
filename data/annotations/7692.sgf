AB[pd][dp][pp]C[usagi5 [5k\]: hi!
EagleHelm [8k\]: hey

I played this game on February 21, 2010.

Hi

Thanks for the chance to review your game. I will preface my comments with "C:"

C: General comments. In a 3 stone handicap game, you should be patient. A game of go is long, and you have to trust that your opponent will make at least 3 mistakes big enough to counter the initial handicap. 

Play for influence, take opportunities to split black's stones apart, try to connect your stones. Don't worry about territory, especially in the first part of the game.

In particular, you should try to leave positions fluid - if you see a sequence isn't going to work, don't push it. Leave the aji for later. I'm referring here particularly to the early fight, that you should have been able to see wasn't going to work.

What I typically find in handicap games is that in the fuseki, or first 50-100 moves, my opponent doesn't really make mistakes. However, once the middle game gets going, then the mistakes start happening. And that was the case here - black made plenty of errors in the middle game fighting, despite having a "won" position after the early fight.]

usagi5 [5k\]: good game to you too];B[pj];W[nq];B[qn]
(;W[pg]C[I'm not sure if I should have played this. I was worried about all that black was building up on the side.

C: You have to be patient. there's 200+ moves to go...black will make mistakes :) Personally I like to create strong shapes which leaves me free to attack hard. So, although Q13 leaves plenty of aji, it feels premature to me to play it. I would simply play out the usual joseki on the bottom right.]
;B[nd];W[jp]C[C: Playing a faster, lighter game, as you've chosen to do, is also possible, it's a matter of style.]
;B[cj]C[C: I don't like this from black. Black should be seeking to undermine your stones on the bottom, attacking Q13 on a large scale, or approaching D16. It's not a bad move in itself, but it lacks severity in the current context.]
(;W[dn]C[C: The problem with this is that it's likely to induce black to move to the right, which will probably weaken your stones on the bottom. Also, you've played into a pincer, which can't be good. F3 feels natural to me.]
;B[fp];W[no]C[C: You now have two isolated stones. They're both light, but still.]
;B[cm]C[C: This is probably too close from black. The secret to effective attacks is to attack from a distance. Sometimes you have to play on a vital point to kill a shape, but that's not possible when there's only one stone. 

In particular, a diagonal moves is essentially a contact move, and is likely to strengthen your opponent.]
;W[cn];B[hq]C[C: This is the induced weakening of your bottom group I suggested might happen earlier - and I didn't look ahead, promise :)]
(;W[cl]LB[dm:b]C[C: I don't understand this move. Hane or bend is more usual shape move.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[bl];W[ck];B[bk];W[el];B[dm];W[en]C[C: I'm not sure I understand this sequence. Are you hoping to kill black's stones on the left? That seems incredibly unlikely. It's certainly not building influence.]
;B[em];W[fn];B[bp]TR[bn][cn][dn][en][fn]C[C: That's a lot of stones played on dame points.]
(;W[dj]C[I think I should have just G8.

C: The stones just aren't worth saving. Do something else.]

(;B[dk]C[C: Mistake from black.];W[bj];B[dl];W[cj];B[ek];W[fl]
C[I don't know why I tried to save this stone.

C: I can only think you still had fanstasies of killing the black group.]
;B[fm];W[gp];B[go];W[fo]C[When I cut here, I am thinking I can live in the corner.]
;B[gn]C[C: I think black is overplaying here, but it's hard to read so far ahead.]

(;W[br]C[Maybe this was an overplay.

C: Looks like it. It's very complicated, however. There are some variations shown that appear to work, but I may have missed some tesuji's.]
;B[bq];W[cr];B[do];W[eo];B[cq];W[ds];B[ar];W[aq]C[I think this was a bad throw-in; it made have to play A6 or A7 to block.]
;B[ap];W[am];B[fk]C[Since I played A7 and black captures the two stones, I have no hope. Is there anything I could have done differently in this fight?]
;W[es];B[as];W[cs];B[ao];W[an];B[co];W[bs];B[al];W[aq];B[ar]
;W[as];B[gs];W[aq];B[fs]C[I die.

C: True. Still, there's a big ko threat there :) Actually, once you see that a fight is going to fail, the sooner you stop it, the better, as it means you have more ko threats. However, in this game, it's really time to resign. To win now would really require a terrible blunder from black.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[qd]C[C: Need to be very active now, so this is good.]
;B[qc];W[qe];B[rc]
(;W[qj]C[C: Can consider an invasion, see variation. Not neccessarily better, tho. Either way, your stones are just too weak for these moves.]
