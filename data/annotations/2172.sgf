AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[reviewed by Joe Carl (JoeSeki 1k* KGS, shadow 2k* IGS)
for Black.

A summary for Black:  Black needs to think more about where the big points for development are.  He seems intent on capturing white stones rather then developing his own stones.  Quite often black cuts white off only to hurt his own stones. and leave necessary moves unplayed.

black should concentrate on developing areas of territory and have no weak groups (relative to the opponent) on the board.  do not cut or seperate if it is not threatening to kill or develops some area for territory. NEVER cut and seperate only to find yoself left with a weak group doing the seperating and have two stong groups on either side of him.  And NEVER attack another agroup and force it into your own territory, enclose it first.]
;W[nq]LB[qn:a][jq:b][qq:c]C[The biggest areas for development that have a relationship with the white stone are shown a-c.  Point a is the biggest, Point b is the second biggest, Point c is the smallest.]

(;B[jp]C[Black took the second biggest Point.  Usually this is an effort to drive white into the smallest point (the corner) but such a lose pincer does not accomplish this well.]
;W[pr]C[Very slow move by White, a double pincer would be better.]

(;B[qq]C[Now whites move is a good one cause you answered it.]

(;B[og]LB[qi:a]C[RGW: Wasted move?

It was already a false eye, yes a wasted move.  The white stone is not doing anything useful, it can be given up easily]
;W[oj]
(;B[nd]LB[dj:a][pl:b]TR[pj][qj]C[Point A is the biggest on the board, but you now have a weak group as well.  The marked stones are weaker then whites, so white no longer has a weak group on the board. O16 attaches to a strong group but I don't see the point to it.  Black is alive already and this only helps white take territory at the top.

Point B strengthen black and puts white on the defensive again]
;W[mc]C[RGW: This is helping white more than black, isn't it?

Yes it is];B[md]C[helping white again];W[lc]

I shouldn't have given white the opportunity to play Q8, but once that happened was there any way for me to save those two stones?

Nothing that doesn't help may white strong.];W[ql]
(;B[ri];W[sh];B[rl];W[rk];B[rm];W[qk];B[qr]C[You had to play R2 anyway, so all the other moves only helped White more.  He's got a live shape now, before he didn't.  Later on in the game when liberties start dissapearing white would still be weak and he's have problems.  Don't force white to make his weak groups strong.]
;W[hq]
(;B[iq]LB[dj:a]SQ[jp]C[Black is playing a jealous game now.  The biggest area on the board is around point A.

The marked black stone is outnumbered 5 stones to 1 stone, why make it heavy?]
;W[hp]
(;B[ir]C[RGW: I thought it was important to separate white. Was it?

Not really.  Seperating a strong group to make a weak group is never a good idea.  It seems more like Black has been seperate.  One weak white group between two weak black groups.  I prefere white's position in this fight]
;W[dq]C[Contact moves are for emergencies.  White feels this is an emergency so he's contacting your stones so he can get stronger.  The reality is Black is weak here, and should be happy to get stronger.

Yilun Yang says when one stone touchs another stone.  If stronger extend.  If weaker then Hane.  He has a different saying for groups touching groups.

black is weaker, he should hane, only the corner makes sense.]

(;B[ep]C[RGW: This seems too passive.  Was there a better move?

You are framing territory on the left side and letting white have the corner.  Very inefficient]
;W[eq];B[cq];W[fp];B[fo];W[fq]C[White can still get the corner,  Now white has no weak groups.]

(;B[kq]C[Since white can settle easily in the corner, this is just adding more stones to an already weak group.  White will should win this game by tormenting this group.]

Instead of this, I thought there might be a play around S10 or T9, but didn't
think it would work.  Did I miss a chance here?

No chance for black here.];W[ch]C[This is big, but it's in the wrong place.  3rd line is for invasion, and this is not the right spot at all]
;B[cj]C[RGW: I this the wrong direction?

Excellent.  this the right spot!];W[ce]C[White is going to get a weak group now, and forces black to take territory as well.  This my turn the game around.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[ed]C[RGW: Would E15 be better?

I like this move.  E15 would give white a cut to play with, this move doesn't help white settle]

Nothing good up here will do.  It's only 10 points while the center is 50-60, and threatens to kill white.]
