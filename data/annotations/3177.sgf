C[Human strength is 6 Kyu.  Computer playing at level 4. I'm playing White here.

Kyo [16k\]: Hello !];B[gd];W[cf];B[fg];W[ec]C[Kyo [16k\]: I do not know the josekis on a 9*9 board, but this seems a bit risky to me. Since the center is worth almost nothing, you should secure the corners first. Here the 3-3 invasion is still possible, and the upper-right corner is not a safe placement, because of the G6 stone.]
;B[ch]
(;W[gc]C[Josh: I wanted to ensure territory on the top here.

Kyo [16k\]: A possible move. But it does not take much territory, and reiforce the G6 stone, while leaving a weakness in C7.
G8 looks better to me as far as the corner is concerned];B[hc]

(;W[fc]C[Josh: Didn't want to be cut, perhaps G8 would have been better?

Kyo [16k\]: Yes, G8 looks better. Try to avoid as much as possible (not always, though) such a line formation. With G8 your stones are connected all the same.]
;B[cc]C[Josh: Not sure how to go about defending an invasion like this or how urgent it is I play up there.

Kyo [16k\]: The E7 stone is strong, and C4 supports you well when defending. (see variations). Black will have a tough time escaping, and that option will be lost after the attack at F4]

(;W[ff]C[Josh: Wanted to try to cut my opponent.

Kyo [16k\]: That is the idea. Black is ahead in territory, so you should do something.]
;B[hb]
(;W[gb]C[Kyo[16k\]: This move shows the connection at F7 was bad. Moreover, G8 is slow. All you have to fear is the invasion at E9, which would not strengthen the H8 group. Your cutting at F4 was a good idea, so follow it up.]
;B[be];W[ce]C[Kyo[16k\]: Nice to Black, allowing him to connect.]
;B[gf]C[Kyo[16k\]: Now Black is almost connected.]
(;W[fe]C[Josh: Would cutting at G3 have been better?

Kyo [16k\]: You have to cut at G3 to follow your initial plan.]
;B[ge]C[Kyo[16k\]: Now Black is far ahead in the game.];W[eg]
;B[bd];W[cd];B[bf];W[bg];B[cg]C[Josh: Whoops, didn't notice the cut here.]
;W[dc];B[ah]C[Kyo [16k\]: I think Black should have played around C8 to invade a bit more White's territory, since the group can live by itself up there, and the C2 stones can not be disconnected at the moment.]

Kyo [16k\]: Agree];B[ga];W[fa];B[af];W[tt];B[tt]C[Kyo [16k\]: This was not a bad game, but you should try to go on with your ideas. A move by itself is often worth nothing, but is very valuable if you follow it well.]
