C[My general comment is that you need to think more about what is going on over the whole board. 

This has three aspects. 

First, when you estimate the territory, you need to think about it cooly and calmly, and get an impartial estimate of exactly who is winning. For example, at move 82, you say "Black seems behind now.", but that is not really true. If you are using the balance of territory to plan you strategy (which you should be trying to do. It is a very important skill to acquire as you move towards the dan grades) then you must get it right. So practice. Chapter 1 of "The Engame" from the Elementary Go Series explains the basic method, and the book "Positional Judgement" by Cho Chikun explains how to apply in eariler in the game.

Second, you need to find the important areas of the board. This starts for working out what groups are weak, and which are strong. In general you should stay way from strong things (like the proverb "play away from thickness"). If you are extending along the side in the opening: if you are extending from a strong group, play a long extension. If you are extending from a weak group to defend it, play a more solid extension.

There is also the proberb "Urgent points before big points". Opening problems like the ones in "Get Strong at the Opening are full of examples of this. And in this game, after white 82, both players play moves in the bottom right which are not urgent, when there are urgent moves on the left.

Thirdly, and finally, you must have a plan. Again, this is more and more important as you move towards dan levels. It is no good just playing random attacking moves. Why are you attacking? what do you hope to get out of it. The best and simplest plan is "make territory while attacking", but sometimes that is not possible. Perhaps you have to attack in one place to make thickness, and then use that to attack in another place to make territory. 

Estimating the score makes planning easier, becuase if you know you are 20 points ahead, you just need a simple plan like "don't let any of my groups die".

Of course, planning is not easy, and at first you might make the wrong plan. That is why you have to start practicing having a plan when you play right now. So you can start learning from your mistakes.

Perhaps you make plans already. If so, appologies. However none of your comments on the game mentioned having a plan.

The best book on the middle game fighting is still "Attack and Defense" from the Elementary Go Series. Do you own this book? if so, when did you last read it?]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[od];B[mc]C[At this point you could just play in the empty corner. There is never a need to answer an approach to a 3-4 point.]
;W[ne];B[kd]C[If I remember rightly, this is not joseki (N15 is), but this is not a very big mistake. Anyway, if you are interested, you can look in a joseki book yourself.]
;W[dq]C[So white gets the empty corner.]
(;B[oc]C[flydog: Seems that this move has problem. The result
 is not very good for black since black has 4 stones versus 2 white stones. I don't know how  to attack the white.

Indeed. The whole point of the diagonal move at O15 is that it stops black from connecting. It ends up in just the right place to make a hanging connection. Look at what happens if white starts with a 1-point jump instead, and then the sequence goes like the game. You will see that it ends in disaster for white. 

Probably the correct way to attack is the knight's move at Q14. See the variation.]
;W[pc];B[pd];W[nc];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb];W[pe]C[This is probably the wrong move locally for white, since it is gote. I think that white should play J17, then you are in trouble.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[md];W[nd];B[fc]C[Good. You are right to defend your weak group before it is attacked. You have the right idea. 

Hwever, this may not be exactly the right move to do it. Your extension may be too long for safety. Would you be able to cope if white inveded at J17 now?]
;W[qf]C[Also too slow by white.];B[cf]C[Good.];W[ee];B[cc]
(;W[cd]C[This is probably the wrong direction. If I was white, I would block the other way, and hope to attack. See variation.]
;B[dc];W[ge];B[ed];W[fd];B[ec];W[df]C[Mistake by white. In this shape white has to connect solidy to stop black connecting under.]
;B[hd]C[Good.];W[lb];B[co]C[Good. This is bigger than playing at the top.]
;W[cm];B[eo];W[fq]
(;B[cq]TR[eo][fq]C[flydog: Also a bad move. I never know to how response
 in this kind of situation. The pincer seems tight.

Yes, white's pincer is on the close side.

The rule of thumb is that the pincer stone should be n-spaces away from an n-stone wall. Because of the marked exchange, the white stone is now one-space away from a two-stone wall. The normal way to take advantage in this situation is to play D8. The normal joseki is shown in the variation. C9 is also possible sometimes, but at othertimes it is an overplay.]
;W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[dn];W[cn];B[dr];W[fp]C[flydog:  Don't know how to deal with the 2 miserable stones.

I don't think that you should be too depressed. White has two weak groups, while you have a live group in the corner, and one weak one in the middle. The way you play looke OK to me.]
;B[dm];W[cl];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[cj]
(;B[bd]C[So far, so good, but this move might be wrong. 

Well, this is a good move in itself, but it may be the wrong time to play it.

The thing is, in this area, you have another option, which is to play C12, separating white into two weak groups. 

It is too dangerous to play this now (see first variation), but you should probably save it for later, so for now, strengthen your weak stones (see second variation).]
;W[cg]C[Now white is connected.];B[be];W[jc];B[jd];W[ic];B[id]
;W[er];B[ds]C[C2 is safer, that way you live for certain. This is dangerous.]
;W[br]C[Good.];B[cr];W[bo]C[I think that white at A/B6 is a better way to try to kill. Actually, I think that you can live anyway, but it is risky, and I may have overlooked a white tesuji.]
;B[bp];W[bn];B[bs];W[aq];B[bq];W[ap];B[ar];W[qk]C[This is the wrong move by white. It is more important to play on the bottom edge, to defend the weak white stones around F3.]
;B[dg]C[flydog: Maybe I should play around K4 or reply at R7.

J/K3/4  would be a good move now, however, this move also works quite well in the game, but perhaps white did not find the best response?]

(;W[eg];B[dh];W[ch];B[de];W[ef];B[eh];W[gg]C[White F12 looks better.]
;B[dj]C[flydog: I think this move is too slow. Maybe I should
 play at G11.

I agree that this it too slow.

I am not sure if G11 is better. What are you trying to achieve? I don't believe that you can capture this white group, since the black stones below are also weak, and there are white stones on the right to connect to. 

So I suppose that you are aiming to strengthen your black group in sente, so that you can then play around J3 and start the next attack.

OK, so G11 is reasonable.];W[qn]C[flydog: Black seems behind now.

I'm not sure. Let's count.

Top right: 15
Top left: 25
Bottom left: 5
Bottom right 5?

Black total: 50


Left: 10
Top & right: 25.
Bottom: 5
Middle 5
Komi 5 

White total: 50

But, you have sente, and white has two weak groups, so I don't see what you are worried about. J3 or K4 now takes territory while attacking.

Basically, white's last move completly misses the point. There is important, urgent fighting going on on the right, and white has just tenukied. This should be your opportunity to sieze control.

The other possiblility is to attack at the top first (is H12 too agressive?) then at the bottom.]

(;B[nq]C[And you miss the chance.];W[rp];B[qq]C[flydog: I regret this move. I think I should play around
 K3.

Absolutely!

flydog: Now black doesn't look any good.

Well, it has become very difficult, particularly after white's next move.]
;W[jq];B[qi]C[This is very dangerous. You are invading wher white is very strong. 

Even if you are a little bit behind. It is important not to panic. Playing bad moves will just leave you a long way behind.]
;W[ok]C[White P10 would be more severe.];B[oi];W[ph];B[pi]
(;W[lf]C[This is not a good move by white. I prefer the white cap at N11. See variation.]
;B[jg]C[Trying to use the weakness of the white stones to help save your black ones on the right is good. Just be careful that the black stones on the left don't get into trouble. 

However, white played badly after you invasion, so you are back in with a chance.]
;W[fh]C[WHite G11 is better shape. This is too slow.]
(;B[gj]C[This is a good try, but probably a mistake. How do you answer white F11? Perhaps down 1 space is a little better.]

(;W[hi];B[mi];W[hj];B[hk];W[ik];B[hl];W[jj];B[mk];W[lj];B[mj]
;W[kh]
(;B[fi]C[flydog: I worried my left side group. So I played at F11 and
 got gote again. Now right side group is a problem.

I think that G6 is a better way to defend this group. If you get strong enough round here then you can think about invading at H3 or 4. 

White can't get in at the top. See variations.

However, N7 on the right may be more important.];W[gi];B[fj]
;W[hc]C[Mistake by white.];B[gd];W[fe];B[gc];W[rq]C[Now white has a problem at the top. See variation.

Also, this is a small move in the corner. It would be better for white to attack the black stones coming out of the right edge. But perhaps white is confident that he is ahead, and trying to wrap up the game. What is the score now?

Top left: 25
Top right: 15
Bottom left: 5
Middle left: 10
Bottom right: 10

Black total: 65


Left: 10
Right: 15
Bottom: 10
Top & middle: 15
Komi: 5

White total 55.

Yes, white should certainly be attacking.]
(;B[rr];W[qp];B[pr]C[flydog: Stupid me. I should play at Q3.

Yes. Particularly important with the weak black stones in the middle.]
;W[po];B[op]C[Do you need to play here? would playing N7 be better?]
;W[nn];B[lm]C[flydog: Bad move. Maybe N6 is better.

Black N6 - White N7. I think you've got problems.];W[lk];B[nm]
;W[nl];B[ml];W[om];B[mm]C[Why connect? White cannot cut you. I would play K7 instead, or maybe M5.]
;W[jm]C[flydog: I didn't move well. I helped white to form his
 territory while I got nothing.

Yes, white catches up compared to our last count.];B[mo];W[gn]
;B[hn];W[gm]C[Dangerous, but perhaps necessary to stop white getting too much territory. 

If you can count really accurately, then it helps with this sort of decision.]
;B[hm];W[gl];B[gk];W[di];B[go];W[fo];B[jo]C[flydog: I mistake for this move. I should play at J5.
 White has to connect his 3 stones.

Perhaps. Or perhaps F6 then squeze, which may be enough to ensure 2-eyes.]
;W[ho];B[io];W[hp];B[kn];W[oa];B[qc];W[ei];B[mb];W[lc]C[As we saw earlier, white can't just connect underneath. Still, this is dangerous. Has white really thought this through?]
;B[ma];W[ld];B[me];W[le];B[mf];W[mg];B[nf];W[ng];B[na];W[oe]

(;B[kg]C[No, No, NO, NO, NO!

;W[gb]C[I think that white is alive here. 

You need to reduce the top to one eye in sente, then play P12, but you can only reduce the top to one eye in gote, if at all.]
;B[fb];W[ha];B[kq]C[flydog: Another bad move.

I'm not sure.

Oops. No, you are right.];W[kr];B[iq]C[M3 now would be OK.]
