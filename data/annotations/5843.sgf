AB[pd][dp]C[Hello. I am playing white.

I didn't notice any major mistakes by myself in this game, which is unusual (except invading lower side too early). Still I didn't manage to win this 2H game.

reid: Hello Zedi,

One shouldn't feel too bad about not winning a handicap game as white.  After all, your opponent has an unfair advantage.  If you play at equal levels, then of course, white cannot win against the handicap.

Your job, as white against a handicap, is to wait for your opponent's mistakes, and then to exploit them.  It is easy to feel that since you're behind, you must somehow force the issue to win the game.  But this is looking for trouble - if you overextend, or if you try to trick your opponent with overplays, you will give your opponent ways to turn the tables.  So you must be patient and wait for his mistakes.  If he makes no mistakes, then he deserves to win.

This is not to say that you can't help things along: as the stronger player, you would like to see more complicated fights developing so that you can take advantage of your presumed superiority in reading, fighting, and positional judgement.  In general, this means that playing 'faster' types of moves is good.  But you must be careful not to make your own mistakes.

One last point: two stones is a very small handicap.  It means your opponent is almost as good as you are.  So you should not expect him to be making large mistakes.  In any handicap game, you cannot expect to pull ahead early on.  You may not be able to secure a win until the game is nearly over.  You must be patient.  If the handicap is right, you will get your chance.

OK, let's see what happened in this game...];W[pp]C[zedi [1d\]: hi
hanabiz [2k\]: hi];B[dc];W[ce];B[ed];W[ch]LB[cd:B][de:C][ci:A]
C[reid: white usually answers E16 with A instead of C12.  Since white makes the short extension, black should immediately play the contact move at B which nearly forces white C.  After C, C12 is too close, and white woudl perfer it to be at A instead.  This is a common joseki, so it's worth looking it up and learing the variations.]
;B[qn];W[ql]LB[bc:A][hc:B][ic:C][cd:D][oo:F][nq:E]C[reid: Since black failed to take advantage of white's short extension in the upper left corner, white should immediately take the corner with A.  This is big by itself, and it also takes black's base so white could then attack somewhere around B  That would be pretty bad for black, so he will probably extend to B or C himself.  Then white can come back to R8.

When white plays at R8 without dealing with the upper left, he cannot be sure that he will keep sente in the lower left, and he may miss the chance at punishing black's failure to play D. 

Perhaps white is worried that if he plays A, black might skip the extension to C and try the double approach at E.  But white can simply pull his head out with F.  Black is building up too many weaknesses - this would be the kind of game white wants to play against a handicap.]
;B[mp]LB[on:C][np:A][nq:B][qq:D]C[reid: N4 is an odd move.  Normal is A or B, and of course C and D are also possible joseki moves.]
;W[oo]LB[pm:B][pn:A]C[reid: White should play A here.  With P5, black can still pull out with B which will be trouble for white.  Black would be able to use his handicap stones to good advantage in the ensuing fights.]
;B[ip]LB[pm:A]C[reid: Too soft.  Black should pull out at A and rely on his friendly stones at D4 and Q16 to make this fight good for him.]
;W[pm]LB[qq:A]C[reid: White must do this, of course.  But now white has played four stones to capture R6 where he should have played only three (Q6 instead of P5 plus Q7).  This would be too slow in an even game, it's even worse against a handicap.

Note that black A is still trouble for white.];B[nc];W[ic]LB[bd:C]
[cd:A][de:B]C[reid: Black O17 was a good move.  Now it is hard for white to take B17 because a black response around J16 or J17 would be very nice.  White lost sente in the lower right, so he missed his chance in the upper left.

While O17 is good, it's still better to make the black A, white B, black C sequence.]
;B[gc]LB[bd:C][cd:A][de:B]C[reid: Oops! black should keep the corner with A, white B, black C.]
;W[lc]LB[ib:F][bc:B][kc:C][cd:A][jd:D][ie:E]C[reid: extending to M17 is natural.  But I think white should be more proactive here:  White M17 lets black start the corner sequence with A.  What if white takes B instead?  We can expect black to pincer wtih C and then white needs to keep black separated, so D looks good (jumping to E leaves black with a safety net: he can connect at F if he needs to).  This would start a fight, which is what white wants in a handicap game.

Black should have taken the corner when he had the chance.  Black prefers to keep the game simple.]
;B[co];W[er]LB[bc:A]C[I think this was bad, and wrong point too, though I usually don't invade at this point so I wanted to try it :)

reid: Yes, this is too soon.

In any fight, you want to have the upper hand, right?  That usually means you would like a numeric superiority of stones.  In the lower left, white has one stone against three (D4, C5, and J4).  If black responds, it's one against four.  Of course, white should expect to be at a disadvantage here and black should get a better result.

If we look at the board, there are at least two other places where white has much better odds:  if white plays somewhere around S16, it's three white agains two black stones (although black has the corner first, so that helps him somwhat),  In the upper left, if white plays at A, it's five white against three black.

It should be pretty clear from this analysis that white should be attacking in the upper left, and that the lower left should be that *last* place white thinks about.]
;B[dr];W[eq];B[dq];W[gq];B[iq]C[reid: Now black is attacking white.  This is not a good situation for white.  While white struggles to live, black makes territory.  It's supposed to be the other way around: black should be fighting for his life and white should be scooping up points as black struggles.

This is a natural result after white invades at E2.];W[fo];B[pq]
LB[bd:C][cd:A][de:B]C[reid: Black doesn't need to rush to take this corner.  The potentialy weak D17 group is more urgent: black can take the A, white B, black C sequence now.]
;W[oq]LB[qq:A]C[reid: white cannot kill this corner.  He is better off playing A to keep the corner territory.]
;B[pr]LB[qq:A]C[reid: Black A is probably simpler.  The black stones live easily.]
;W[or];B[qp];W[qq];B[po];W[op];B[qr]C[reid: Ouch.  White used to have about 10 or twelve points in this corner.  Now black has 10 or twelve points.  That's a tweny point loss for white.  It's hard to redeem that loss by attacking black because the white stones at F5 are too weak to fight effectively.]
;W[kp];B[rq]LB[qe:B][qj:A]C[This was unnecessary of b i think.

reid: Yeah, seems to be.  On the other hand, it eliminates a lot of aji.  Later, white gets a moyo on the left side, but it's hard to hold because black has sente moves near A thanks to this capture.  Still, it would be more direct to eliminate the moyo immediately with black B.]
;W[kq];B[jo];W[ko];B[hn]LB[jm:A]C[reid: this shape is a bit awkward.  Black can just jump to A.]
;W[fm];B[kn];W[ln];B[km];W[lm];B[kl]C[reid: Now black H6 is a wasted move.  So black should have jumped to K7 instead.]
;W[mk]C[reid: White is not making much territory here (remember to subtract the twenty point loss in the corner).  And he can't attack the black stones effectively because F5 is still weak.

In the introduction, you mentioned that you thought the invasion at E2 was too early.  I think it is the losing move.  This whole situation is a direct result of that invasion, and we can see that white is rapidly losing any chance of getting back into this game.]
;B[dl];W[fk];B[gl]C[reid: this peep is bad.  Black doesn't need it, and it helps white when he responds.]
;W[fl];B[ik]LB[bd:C][cd:A][de:B]C[reid: looks like black is satisfied with just a couple of points in the center.  This is way too small.  Black should play the A-C sequence to remove his weakness here, then the center group would not have any trouble finding life.

At this point, black has no significant weaknesses, and he is ahead on territory.  That means it's difficult for white to catch up.

Go is all about fighting: fighting for eyes, fighting for life, and fighting for territory.  In this game, both players were ignoring the fight for eyes and life in favor of the fight for territory.  Because this is a handicap game, white should be looking for ways to make complicated fights so he can use his superior reading abilities.  It is not reasonable to expect to win against a handicap without using the advantage that makes the handicap necessary in the first place.

The proverb says "play the urgent point, not the big point".  In this game, the urgent situation in the top left corner was missed by both players.  White tried to take the big point of E2 and ended up with a heavy group

 As white playing against a handicap, you must take it on faith that playing the urgent moves and not the big moves will lead to victory.

Good luck, play strong - reid
