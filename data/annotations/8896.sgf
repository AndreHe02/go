C[Hello to the reviewer!

I'm Sakharov1 (black here), about 7-8 kyu KGS -- I've been playing for about a year and a half with a 6 months hiatus, read a lot about the game but I don't play often enough. This game was against my long-time adversary Hludowicus 5kyu KGS -- we were playing pretty close even games before my pause, and now that we meet again, I notice he has improved a lot!... My main grope is with the middle game -- I get pushed around a lot, and I feel the adversary always gets the advantage of building his own territory while simply reducing my moyo. He doesn't even have to invade, simple reduction moves are usually sufficient. Am I too defensive? Maybe I should counterattack more.

Will be glad to hear your commentary!


GDK - Hello Sakharov1 and Hludowicus!, My name is Guillaume and I enjoyed reviewing this game for you. Before You read any further I'd like to ad that my comments aren't golden rules to live bye but should give you ideas of what to think about while playing go. I have Put my initials (GDK) before every comment I wrote and I've written a general comment of the game at move 104. I hope this review can be of some help.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo]LB[ce:a][de:b]C[<Sakharov1>: Didn't want to open with the chinese this time -- I overdo it.

GDK - Theory sais that the corner inclosure is a big move, and I really think it is. In this situation though it's not my favorite.
Think about it, the corner enclosure has two effects, it protects some corner territory and usualy is a good base to start building a framwork out of.

In this case the corner enclosure radiates influence towards the lower left side of the board. The problem is that white has a stone there.
If you look at blacks position on the right side, you feel the move 5 is a bit low.
Corner enclosures like 5 can be way more effective, you just have to look at the whole board situation and thats why I would rather have played at A or B in this situation.]
;W[ci];B[fq]C[<Sakharov1>: I hesitated between this and K4, but felt K4 wouldn't put pressure on him, so he would probably answer at K16 and have quite the moyo.

GDK - I like this move, it works nicely with the corner enclosure you have in the lower right. And you are right, K4 would ber a bit weak.]
;W[dn]
(;B[ip]SQ[lq][mq][nq][kp][lp][np][mp]LB[kq:a]C[<Sakharov1>: Didn't want to give him an invasion point

<Hludowicus>: This feels a bit slow, compared to the expected three space extension.

GDK - It feels a bit slow to me too, if you want to play a move like 9 it's so that you could initiate a strong attack on any white stone that would invade around the area at the bottom. In that case though, if someone invaded at A, the shape of the two stones on the left will have too much weaknesses. If you want to use a move like 9 then it should definatly be at J3.

But in this situation I would play faster and play 9 one space to the right at K4. If white splits the two grstones you can still build a nice frame in combination with the corner inclosure on the right AND really inportant: you can still invade the corner at C-3 and F3 will be of some use for that.]
(;W[nc];B[pf]C[<Sakharov1>: We're not very aggressive players -- maybe that move was a little passive. Felt like I was building a very easily invadable moyo.

<Hludowicus>: I felt all this was building toward an even division of the board between us, which seems like one correct way to play. In any case, black's moyo did not feel weaker: it has three groups of two, well-connected stones.

GDK - I think the game is pretty much even for now and that there is nothing wrong with this style of play, if you feel confortable playing this way then thats good. I'm sure white feels more pressure in this situation because black gets the advantage of starting and so his moyo always looks a bit bigger when it's white's turn.]
;W[jd];B[de]C[<Sakharov1>: Felt like I had to invade, but his moyo is more tight than mine, he'll profit from that weak group, but I couldn't let him play here! Should I have fortified my own moyo at this point, and invited him to invade himself?

<Hludowicus>: This invasion/probe seems fine. White will certainly respond, so Black will have the possibility to play elsewhere anyway. Sakharov1 will second guess each of his moves!

GDK - This is a good move ^^];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb]
;B[dh];W[ck]C[<Sakharov1>: Didn't know how to answer that locally, so I tenukied. Wrong place though, I think]
;B[dr]C[<Sakharov1>: Probably smallish at this point, proof being he managed to play some sente moves before coming back to protect the 3-3. I probably should have capped the top with F14, or invaded at H16 (probably too soon for that though).

<Hludowicus>: I agree, this move is bad timing. But yet, it is worth a lot, it has an obvious follow-up, and it makes it more difficult for white to plan an invasion of the lower side, so it cannot be a major mistake.

GDK - The black grooup on the top left won't be the place where black will get the most points and doesn't seem to be in iminent danger so I understand why you treat it lightly.

Move 21 is not bad but is worth about as much as Q8, I would wait until white choses one of the two and then I would play the other.]
;W[qh];B[qj]C[<Sakharov1>: I saw that as a good opportunity to fortify my lower moyo. I wanted him to take the corner, to be able to invade his top.

GDK - Good idea ^^];W[ne]C[<Sakharov1>: I wasn't happy with that, a great move by white.

<Hludowicus>: Indeed, I am happy with this one. Should I be?

GDK - I'm not sure of how to evaluate this move because now black can put tremendous pressure on thr invading white stone at R12]
(;B[oj]C[<Sakharov1>: Going on with my plan, no choice.

<H> Excellent response, to the point where I'm not so sure R12 was good to start with...

GDK - I think P13 is more severe for black, because now his two stones on the top right could be in trouble since white runs out before them]
(;W[cq]C[GDK - P12 is so big for white];B[ph]C[<Sakharov1>: Another slow move? I think I realized a little bit too late the potential of the white top. I was getting carried away by my own moyo -- which was getting impressive though. But hludowicus always manages to reduce it (almost always REDUCES).

<H> Yes, this feels slow, especially since it does not completely stiffles the aji of white R12.

GDK - this move may look slow but I think it saves black from a lot of futur trouble.]
;W[pr];B[oq]C[<Sakharov1>: Letting him have a small corner if he wants. F6 and F14 both felt very important now. I felt confident but still I felt the weakness of my upper left group would probably help him reduce.

GDK - this is a nice game to watch];W[ff]C[<Sakharov1>: Sente because of that damn weak group. My hopes of getting a strong center are getting slimmer...

GDK - This is always to be expected when you invade an enemy's sfere of influence ALSO the most points in games usualy come from the corners and sides, the center is hard to get because it can be reduced by sooooooooo many different angles and sides. Don't put too much hope in center territory.]
;B[di]LB[df:a]C[GDK - When it gets tight you have to be careful. Here white can split the black group at A. you should read it out to be sure though. (good exercice)]
(;W[dj];B[fi];W[jg];B[ej]C[<Sakharov1>: I was focusing (too much?) on defending that group, and he was making points like crazy at the top. My moyo was still wide open. His territory is very solid, and he is peeking in the center from two places -- The stone at D2 should have been at F6

GDK - Black has no choice here but to defend his stones (Although I think they can still be cut at D14). If all those black stones live I think the game is pretty even and might tend to blacks favor since white has to reduce black next.]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[el];B[ij]C[<Sakharov1>: Still two big holes, I was expecting a deep reduction with threats to connect at the top or the left.

GDK - This is ok. Only D14 is  bothering me a bit]
(;W[kl]C[<Sakharov1>: and there he comes. How to deal with that kind of move, I have no clue. I played chicken and protected my thin lower "territory", feeling I couldn't trap the stone. I feel I overestimated the value of the right and low portions while underestimating the value of his upper territory at this point.

GDK - My gut would tell me to make sure running wont be easy for white bye playing something like L4. I will make sure to get profit later]
(;B[lp]TR[mn][mo]C[<H> Was it possible to play a more polyvalent move, like N5 or N6?

GDK - You have nearly total freedom in go so if you have a good reason why not ^^]
;W[ko];B[kp];W[nm];B[pm]C[<Sakharov1>: Getting pushed around... Those were probably passive moves, but I'm curious to hear what I could have done differently.

GDK - L14 cuts one escape rout and makes it more of a fight.Then later if white reduces here you can always compenste that bye playing Q18]
;W[hm];B[pc]C[<Sakharov1>: Still felt I had an advance in territory -- all I had to do was to put another stone in the lower right corner...

<H> Good timing here by black. If it wasn't for my two lone stones on the right side, it would be difficult to keep hope!

GDK - the black stones on the top left look like they could get in some trouble though L-10 is looking big for white too]
;W[ng];B[jb]C[<Sakharov1>: This might seem like an overplay, but all I wanted was to play O18 in sente -- I was feeling the center wasn't important anymore.

GDK - you're goup on the upper left side of the board still isn't totaly out of problems though]
;W[fb];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[mc]C[<H> Another proof of black's good timing. This reduction is huge, and in sente. I was really starting to feel queasy...]
;B[ec]C[<Sakharov1>: Wow that was bad. R2 or C2 were way better -- C2 particularly, since it has a follow-up move]
;W[ed];B[dd];W[db];B[ch]C[<Sakharov1>: No points prospect there!!! What was I thinking?

<H>: To my 5k brain, this is black's first major mistake. He is basically giving sente away, which amounts to giving me one last chance to get in the game.

GDK - I would say that after this exchange things r looking better for that black group ^^]
;W[cr]C[<Sakharov1>: In the end white will play on BOTH C2 and P2 -- how TINY were those E17 and C12?

GDK - I'm not that good at counting yose move yet but why not reply here by playing 
n19 (big sente move with nice follow up) or C11 and then replying C-2, that way white doesn't get all the big points in a row]
;B[bi]C[GDK - ^^ nice];W[or];B[nr];W[qq];B[qp];W[rq];B[rp];W[rr]
;B[nq];W[qs]C[<Sakharov1>: Not sure that was necessary though.

<H>: Right. I'm not proud of that one... I was in byo-yomi, and I've been neglecting tsumegos lately... In fact, I am giving sente away. Terrible...

GDK - Yeah, life and death problems are all about practice. The more you play and do exercises, the better you'll get: lifetime guarentee ^^]
;B[bj];W[bk]C[<Sakharov1>: Now I'm clearly losing. What happened? The last 10 moves were bad, now I felt I had to threaten to reduce the top or cut some stones in the lower center.

<H> I do not agree. The game seems even. Black has sente.

GDK - I have to agree with Hludowicus here, this game is not over yet ^^ blacks right side looks huge. If white can't do anything about it I would thing black would win]
;B[lj]C[<Sakharov1>: That's why I played here.

<H> Another sente loosing move? I'm starting to think that both Sakharov1 and I would benefit greatly from tighter playing in the chuban. We are basically giving away sente, playing moves that are of little value.


GDK - yeah, this move would have been a lot more severe earlier in the game. Things are setling down now, and so this move has becaume small.]
;W[go];B[gq]C[<Sakharov1>: But my threats are toothless with such weaknesses left in my own shape...]
;W[pi];B[qi]C[<H> Maybe black should have protected the upper right instead. The points he would have made there would have been certain. Here, his right lower side is still vulnerable to a reduction. And the series of three reductions that starts here seems to decide the game.]
;W[pg];B[oh];W[og];B[qg];W[qf];B[rh];W[pe];B[qe];W[of];B[re]
C[GDK - why not just S14  here?];W[ae];B[be];W[ad];B[ac];W[bc]
;B[af];W[bd];B[bf];W[df];B[cf];W[ee];B[ce];W[er];B[eq];W[dq]
;B[fr];W[ep]C[<Sakharov1>: Situation now seems hopeless for me -- in the end, he didn't answer my weak "sente moves", while he exploited every default in my own shapes.

<H>: It did feel like I was winning at that point, so I agree with Sakharov1's analysis. Then again, I'd be curious to know what we are both missing! We obviously made many mistakes that decided the direction of the game.


GDK - This wil be my last comment for the game: I think both of you are heading in the right direction. Sakharov, you definatly play better than you think you do. Just try and make every next move the most efficiant one and then everything should always go fine.

Also I would like to add that this was a moyo game that started of with huge frameworks. But a couple of times where white invaded or reduced black, black answered with what I would call somewhat timid moves.

Build a moyo and when the other player makes a deep invasion don't make it too easy for him. (I'm thinking about the R12 or even the L8 reduction) invasion.

Work on your game bit bye bit and you guys will make it far ^^

Enjoy!];B[ma];W[la];B[na];W[lb];B[ak];W[al];B[aj];W[cl];B[cj]
C[<Sakharov1>: Now time stress is taking its toll. The game is already lost, but this move is dreadful.

<H> Indeed. Black could still win if he went directly for reductions, in sente. This last move is another of our usual sente loosing moves... My game is also full of those (see R1...).]
;W[oc];B[qb];W[hp];B[hq];W[io];B[jo];W[jn];B[jp];W[kn];B[nh]
TR[lg]C[<H> Thank-you move. Sakharov1 could do a better job at reducing. Here, he is pushing the cart from behind, in a situation that gives him no points, while I do take profit from his action. Would M13 be better for him?]
;W[mh];B[mi];W[lh];B[eg]C[<Sakharov1>: another bad move. I'm very weak at reducing the opponent.]
;W[fg];B[hg]C[<H> Too late for that? I tend to agree with Sakharov1: better reductions/attacks in the chuban would give him many games over me.]
;W[hf];B[ig];W[if];B[mn]C[<Sakharov1>: Another typical example of our difference in strength: here I want to threaten this white stone and to close my territory in sente -- or even better, to isolate and capture that stone. He'll end up reducing the entire right side...]

[kr][lr][fs][gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls]C[<Sakharov1>: There you go. I feel the second part of the chuban and the yose went very badly for me -- as usual. I still have to improve on fuseki of course, but the chuban -- particularly answering reducing moves and reducing the opponent myself -- is where the difference in strength is the most apparent. Hludowicus thinks it's because I study too much and I don't play enough -- he might be right about that.

<Hludowicus> I agree. Sakharov1 is not dangerous enough in the chuban and yose. But he has better potential that I do, as his fuseki shows.

Thank you for your comments and for your time!!
