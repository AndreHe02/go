C[To my dear reviewer,

Hello and thanks for taking this rewiec. I'm cb22 and I'm sending this game for both anthrax and me. We have discuss a bit about this game at the end, with some players but no one stronger than 5k.

Anthrax would like to know if he messed up somewhere in the opening. He felt he was a lot behind and didn't find a big move to maybe turn the tables on.

For my point, I would like to know where are my mistakes (I put a note later for a missed invasion) and what move could have been better or was too slow.

Thanks a lot !

Hello, Clement!

This is Bernd, HonFu in the GTL and on KGS.

It was an interesting fighting game, but especially on black's side I found that he seems to not know one basic strategic principle - not to play close to strong groups.

On white's side I see the urge to attack directly whenever there seems to be an opportunity. But sometimes it can be larger to keep the threat of attacking, playing somewhere else and preparing an indirect attack! 

Both principles I will explain with some examples in the review.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn]
(;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]C[Hon: When black plays here, he has a solid, living group. To my feeling black seems to be standing too low on the lower side, but that might be a matter of taste. 

One thing is important though. A basic principle in go is that we play away from solid groups, so both players should avoid adding stones on the lower side.]
;W[po]
(;B[qo]C[Hon: This is a mistake in direction, since the right side is more valuable than the bottom (it is wider, and not solid yet).]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[qj]C[Hon: After the joseki ends, black is overconcentrated at the bottom, since two solid groups that don't need help, sit close to each other.]
(;B[fc];W[hc];B[fe];W[cf];B[id]C[I think this choice of joseki wasn't good, because black needs a working ladder around Q8 no ?

Hon: I have trouble with understanding this joseki myself - especially since professionals seem to not agree about that issue. Takeo Kajiwara wrote in "Direction of Play", that the ladder does not matter. Whenever I play this joseki, I get into trouble, so I really can't say a lot about it.]

(;W[jf]C[Was it the right time to escape or can I keep some aji for later ? I intended to attack the black stones around G14 and build some territory on the left but after I felt like helping black making territory upside

Hon: You both have a weak group each, so it is natural that black will also profit.

Maybe, just maybe it would be wiser to get R13 before you move from here.]
;B[jg]C[Hon: Black presses from one weakness towards his other.]
;W[kf];B[le];W[je];B[kc];W[ig]C[Hon: In the end it falls back on black, and the original pressing stone gets cut off. Unpleasant result for black.]
;B[cj]C[What is the best way to handle this stone ?

Hon: This stone again violates the principle of not approaching strong groups. What does that stone want here, right in the middle of two white solid groups?

Maybe it is best to just ignore the stone for now and ladder K13, so that white becomes strong.]
(;W[di]C[Hon: Maybe a bit too direct. 

Black's stones at the top are already so "dead", that he can sacrifice them lightly if you attack them directly.]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[dj];B[em]
(;W[gi];B[qg]C[Hon: It is a pity that black comes here first. I think an extension here would be worth more for white than the capture of the few stones.]

;W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[rl];W[ql];B[rn];W[rk];B[qm];W[pm];B[rm]
;W[pf]C[Hon: Probably white should connect at Q8. It is not good to leave a weak spot like that.

But I understand the urge to do something with the two stones.]
;B[pg];W[of];B[og];W[nf];B[ng];W[mf]
(;B[lf]C[Hon: This move is not good. it weakens the right side group - a family feud. Better would be to keep N13, a sente move which helps the right group.]
;W[mg];B[oi];W[rh];B[rg];W[ok]C[Hon: White can be happy - he managed not only to strengthen his weak point, but also forced black to give him a good reason to!]
;B[mh];W[lg];B[nj];W[hp];B[hq];W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[gq]
(;W[fo];B[gm]C[Hon: Now it looks as if white is getting a double attack.

Also we see now that the lower side turns quite flat - a side effect on building up close to strong groups.

I don't find a move to really contain black, so maybe another way to attack would have been better.]
;W[li];B[im];W[hn];B[hm];W[lk];B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[nm]C[Hon: White's shape on the right is still a bit thin, so he can't attack too hard. That's a pity.]
;B[mk];W[md];B[mc];W[lc];B[ld];W[nc];B[me]C[Here I quite messed up. O18 could have worked has a reduction?

Hon: probably better to just play the normal endgame from P19 in the first place.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[mb];B[nb];W[mc];B[kd];W[kl];B[jn];W[kn];B[io]
;W[lm];B[ri];W[qi];B[qh];W[mi];B[sh]C[Hon: Black's right group was stronger from the beginning, so maybe it was better to attack the left side harder, by blocking its road to the center early.

Still, white is ahead, basically because of his inefficient way to play at the bottom and because of his unreasonable invasion of the left side.]

Hon: Thank you, it was fun! :)

(;AE[cn][cq][fq][iq][dr]C[Hon: If black hadn't played the joseki in the lower right yet, then he would prefer to play it from the other side.]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck]C[Hon: If the same joseki happened, then white would be developing his hoshi stone into the direction of the solid group in the lower right. This again would violate the principle of not playing in the direction of solid groups. 

In the game, black instead helped white to play away from the solidity and played there himself. This may illuminate, why the combination of the two joseki in the game was wrong.]
