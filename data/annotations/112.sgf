 jmg 15k : q10 ?

 ** This move is doubtful I think. It aims at the invasion on O3 of course.]

(;B[lo];W[qk]L[gp]C[ ** This is a good move, and probably necessary after M5. White  would have liked more   backup in the form of surrounding thickness. Also white is apprehensive   about the invasion point a), after which K3-K4 would become heavy.]
;B[qi]C[
 wave 8k*:  r6];W[ok]L[pm][qm][pn][qn]C[ ** White should extend before jumping out into the  center. a), b) c) and d) are
 all possible.]
(;B[oi]C[ ** This move isn't doing much.  Better to play from the other side (see prev. comment).]
;W[qn];B[pn]C[ **  Good!];W[pm];B[po];W[nm];B[no]L[cf][pb][cn][gp]
C[ ** Black is too strong here to make it worth  an extra move. Alternatives are a) and b).
 Personally I wouldn't play c) for fear of destroying the invasion d). The  white group
 has good shape, so attempting to steal it's base is probably not worth it.]
;W[rn];B[ro]C[ ** Adds a little pressure on the white  group, but its very early in the game still.
 The extra territory is not worth it either.]
(;W[jm];B[lm];W[ni];B[nh];W[ll]C[
 wave 8k*:  w seems to worry too much about that group.
   ** This move doesn't work. White should play O10 or N11.];B[km];W[kl]
;B[jn]C[ ** Black could cut directly here.];W[in]L[jl][kn][im]C[ ** This move hurts the two  white stones below. a) and b) are possible, whereas   c) would invite black to start pushing, and this would also hurt the two  white stones.]
;B[im];W[jl];B[io];W[hn];B[jo];W[gq]L[gm][ik][gp][fn]C[ ** You should know the tesuji a) (or b)) for  setting the black cutting stone in   motion while retaining good shape. G3 works quite well for white, but there  are   still a lot of weak points in the white posision for black to exploit. If  you want
 to break through the white position, you should consider moves like c) and  d),   but you could also leave it as bad aji for white (and invade the corner for  example).]
;B[ho];W[gn]C[ ** You're pushing from behind here (cf. 'Lessons  in the fundamentals of go'), which   is normally considered bad style. Of course you're hurting the white  position below,
 but white has also increased his thickness on the outside.  I was expecting  you to   try to break through next.]
;B[cn]C[ ** I would prefer C3.];W[bp]C[ ** White  is patching up his weaknesses here.]
;B[cf];W[fd];B[ej];W[gl];B[bd]C[ ** I  would prefer C17 here.];W[cc];B[ef]
C[ ** Q18, R17, M16 would be big for white  now.];W[gi]L[gf]C[ ** This is not very big. If white wants to reduce the black  territory he should play   from the weaker side - a) for example.]
;B[lc]C[ ** Very good move  after the B16 - C17 exchange.];W[ld];B[md];W
[le]C[ ** This has to be N17 of  course. If white is not happy with that variation he should   play R17 immediately.]
;B[mc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[nd];W[rc]L[rb]C[ **  White should play a) here to live. In Var. 1 is how black can kill white, by   reducing him to an 'L+1' group (cf. 'Life and death').]

(;B[jb]C[ jmg 15k :  i guess B is better now, isn't he ?

 ** Yes. Even if we assume the white group in the upper left corner lives.  Blacks   only weakness appears to be the invasion at C8.]
;W[mh]L[hd][bc][hg]C[  ** White is trying to make center territory. This was the plan behind G11 and  M15.
 I think a) to isolate the white corner group is the biggest move at this  point.   If white answers at b), a followup around c) would reduce the white  center, and at
 the same time pressurising the three white stones above.];B[mi];W[nj];B
[mg];W[lh];B[lg];W[kg]C[ ** Better to just extend.];B[kh];W[li]C[
 wave 8k*:  it seems to be well balanced to me. w can form territory at the  center
 wave 8k*:  which is as big as b's Lower Right corner.];B[kf];W[jg]C[
 jmg 15k : center is just moyo at the moment];B[jf]C[ jmg 15k : ok, now it  looks like territory :)]
;W[if]L[jh]C[ ** White is aiming at sacrificing the  three stones M15, M16 and K16, as in Var. 1.
 The normal move here would probably be a). The conclusion here must be that   pushing has definitely not been in blacks interest, so he should have  reduced   the center moyo in a different way.]

(;B[lf];W[je]C[
 jmg 15k : jive likes to play influence, he is fond of San Ren Sei :)];B
[me]L[ng]C[
 jmg 15k : t14 ?
 wave 8k*:  sanrensei is ideal for thickness.
 wave 8k*:  it doesn't seem to fit me though

 ** a) here would keep white from picking up a stone at P11.];W[cl]L[hg]
[dm][bl][dl]C[It feels as if something could be achieved in w's LL corner, but
how to do it?

 ** White should play the proper move at a), unless he's desperate to catch  up   territorially. I think it is dangerous to play directly in the corner now,  white   is too strong in the surroundings. One important factor to consider at this    point is the balance of territory. In my judgement black should be able to  win   fairly easily, given that he is not giving komi. So he should play   'normal' moves. b) is probably an overplay, c)  has the disadvantage of  being   weak territorially, so I suggest d) (made possible by E10).]

(;B[go];W[en];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[fr];B[er]L[hr][gr][hq]C[Wrong side?

 ** I can't find anything that really works for black here. He could play  a), b), c)   of course, but that isn't really satisfactory either. (But better than the  actual   game).]
;W[gr];B[dq];W[ep];B[dr];W[cq];B[ir]C[ ** This  move doesn't work after white has played G2. Black has lost a lot of points
 trying to reduce the lower left corner.];W[jr];B[kr];W[js];B[ki]C[ ** Very  big!]
;W[lj];B[ig];W[jh];B[ih];W[ji];B[ii];W[kj];B[hf]C[
 jmg 15k : j15];W[bc];B[hd]L[gc][hg]C[ ** Black is catching these stones on a rather  small scale. a) might be more   interesting for example. Even if the white stones escape capture, black  should
 be satsified with reducing the white corner and protecting the cut at b).  Also   if white saves his stones, he is likely to end in gote. Probably you also  felt   a bit cheated after the actual game sequence.]
;W[hc];B[ic];W[hb];B[id];W[gd];B[bl]C[ ** Also very big.];W[bm];B[cm];W
[dl]C[ ** White  should take the black stone B8. Now black is back in the lead.]
