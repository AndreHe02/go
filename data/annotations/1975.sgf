GC[Commentary by Reid Augustin, 020728]

AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Black's comments are preceded by "J:". White's comments are preceded by "N:".    I think I had a very promising game when I invaded the
left side, but everything went wrong. I would be very
grateful if you could tell me why.   I was attacking most of the time, but I think I lack
severity. How could I improve that?];W[jq];B[jd]LB[lq:A]C[reid:  OK, I'll start right here with black's first move.  The game of go is all about fighting.  An essential
element of fighting is the balance of power.  In general,
you want to fight where you are ahead in the balance of
power, and you want to avoid fighting where your
opponent has the edge..

Here we see that black has a tremendous advantage in the
balance of power.  And yet, he reponds to white's first move by
playing almost as far away from white's stone as possible.

Of course, black K16 cannot be bad in the sense that it loses
the game, but it shows a negative attitude; a fear of fighting.

I think something like A (M3) would be more positive.];W[nq]
;B[qn];W[cf]
(;B[fc]LB[ch:A]C[reid:  In general, if black already has the extension to
the marked stone (K16), it is considered good for black
to pincer the white approach move at A (C12).  See  variation.]
;W[bd]C[reid: Black F17 is a bit slow and lets white keep the initiative.]
;B[cc];W[ci];B[pj]LB[qf:A][lq:B]C[reid:  This looks like it has to be an ideal point because
of the symmetry of the board.  But in fact, if we look at
the balance of power, we can see that it's not ideal.

The black corner formation at Q4, R6 is very strong (even
stronger than normal because white is a bit over-extended
from K3 to O3).  On the other hand, the Q16 corner stone
is still easily invadable.  This means that Q10 is played
further from the weaker stone, and closer to the stronger.

I think if black simply wants to make a big, safe territory
move, A (Q14) would be more balanced.

But actually, starting a splitting fight at B (M3) is even
better.];W[nc];B[pc]LB[kc:D][oc:A][nd:B][pf:C]C[reid:  This is a shape right out of a book!  When white
invades between the hoshi points like this, black should
kick at A (P17).  white has almost no choice but to extend
to B (O18).  This exchange is crucial for black - it makes
the white stones heavy.  By playing at Q17 instead, white
doesn't have to respond, and later he might give up O17 -
it is light instead of heavy.

The normal sequence continues with black C, and then
white cannot make his normal extension to D, so he is
not completely comfortable.];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe]
;W[ng]C[J: Strange. More common is p13.];B[qg]LB[ne:A]C[reid:  This is small for black.  Better would be to
keep white split with A (O15).  R13 is an endgame
type move.];W[qh];B[rf];W[ph]LB[qf:B][rg:A]C[reid: In this type of position, white should almost
always exchange A (S13) for B (R14) before connecting.
Later, when black plays at C (S12), it becomes significant.]
;B[fq]LB[hq:A][lq:B]C[reid: F3 doesn't have much effect on white.  But
if black plays A (H3) instead, white must respond.
Or again. black could start a fight right away at B (M3).
Black should not be afraid of fighting where he has a
superiority of forces.];W[cp]LB[ne:A]C[reid:  This probe seems to help black settle this corner.
I think white should be looking to his weak stones, which
would be the somewhat heavy group at P14, etc.  If white
ends this probe in gote (which seems likely), then black
A (O15) would attack white's heavy group while securing
the top side naturally.];B[cq];W[co];B[bq];W[cl];B[lq];W[no]
;B[mp]LB[kp:A]C[reid: This peep helps white a bit.  Better to keep white
split with A (L4).];W[np];B[ln];W[lr]
(;B[nm]C[J: B could cut instead, see variation.

reid: Yes, the variation is much better for black.
The essence of go is fighting, and what we fight
about is life and death,.  This makes splitting
and cutting of groups is crucial.

Each individual group must find two eyes by the
end of the game, or it dies.  Making eyes costs
moves.  So the more groups your opponent must
take care of, the more free moves you get.];W[kq];B[nd];W[md]
C[J: This is dangerous, given the W goup below.

reid: Yes, but white lost his choices when he
probed with C4.  Now he must hope for a mistake
by black.];B[mc]C[J: Maybe o15 is better, dividing W. B wants to take profit on the top side.

reid: Yes, O15 is much harder for white to handle.  White can sacrifice
O17 in exchange for strengthening his weak group.];W[lc];B[mb]
;W[lb]C[J: Why not give atari at o15 first?

reid: yes.  In fact, O15 atari should be before M17 atari.
See variation.]
(;B[ld];W[me];B[nb];W[kd];B[le];W[ke];B[lf];W[jc];B[mf];W[ne]
;B[nf];W[oe];B[od];W[og]C[reid:  That was a painful sequence for white - black cut succesfully
in sente, and now white is heavy.  Black is nicely set up for a  splitting attack.]
;B[lh];W[mh];B[lg]LB[kf:A]C[J: There is a snap-back, so B has to connect.

reid: True, but this connection has no effect on white.  Black
should consider playing A (L14) instead to threaten the top group
a bit while connecting.];W[qj];B[qk];W[rk];B[qi];W[rj];B[rh]
;W[oj];B[pk]C[J: q11 seems more secure.

reid: Nonetheless, white is in serious trouble here.];W[pi]
;B[nj]C[J:B can play s11 killing 3 W stones. B thought s11 only gives W a false eye (and an eye at the first line) so B can go for the big kill.

reid: If black is thinking about the big kill, he should do so from
the start.  Now that he's go the cut in place, I think killing cleanly
by connecting at S11 is the only way (unless black is 100% sure he
can kill the whole group).

In any case, black O10 is peculiar.  If white responds at A (P9), he
is almost out of danger.];W[ri]
(;B[ok]C[J: This is wrong. p11 directly eliminates any W's eye in the center. See variation.]
;W[rm];B[rn];W[oi];B[si]
(;W[sj]C[J: t7 is not better, see variation.];B[sl];W[sh];B[rg]
;W[mi]
(;B[ki]C[J: I think m11 is better. m10 seemed impossible to me, see variation.]
;W[lj];B[mk]C[J: Now B got scared about W o9, killing o10 (a ladder to the right would make W s8 sente), giving W a second eye).]
;W[kk];B[il];W[jk]C[reid: White K9 is aji-keshi.  Unless white intends to push and
cut, he should leave this move.  Later, he might be able to
cut across the knight's move with A (J9).  Since he doesn't
know now, and since K9 is not necessary, better to not play it..]
;B[ik]C[reid: this exchange significantly strengthens black.]
;W[rl];B[sm];W[km];B[jm];W[kj]C[J: Unnecessary.];B[ji];W[kn]
;B[kl];W[ll];B[jl];W[lm];B[lk];W[pm];B[on];W[qm];B[pn];W[nl]
C[J: W is alive.];B[ml];W[ol];B[mm];W[nk];B[mj];W[li];B[ni]
;W[nh]C[J: This is necessary, W has a single eye around q9.]

(;B[mn]C[reid: This move is very slow for black.  Single stones are generally
not worth saving (until the endgame) unless they are cutting stones.
In this case, after white responds, there is no cut, so black has just
helped white to get stronger in this area.

Instead of connecting, black could consider the squeeze at A (L5).
See variation.];W[ko];B[or]LB[qr:A]C[J: B has connected all the stones he has been able to in sente and then lives in the corner.

reid: Hmmm, P2 seems like it's asking for a bit much.  Since white is so far behind
in this game, he has nothing to lose with a brazen corner invasion - something like
A (R2), for example.  If black makes a mistake, the game might change very quickly!]
;W[nr];B[ic]LB[oq:C][qq:B][qr:A]C[J: B is going to take profit on the top. But this is not the point to attack, j16 seems more severe.

reid:  I think Black should defend his corner!  Since white nicely
answered with O2, A (R2) or even B (R3) would be even more severe now!
Black C (P3) is pretty huge.];W[jf];B[jg]LB[jb:A][kc:C][kh:B]
C[J: B has to defend the cutting point at l12.

reid: But first!  One should always be on the lookout for
advantage to be taken because of sequence.  In this case,
black should atari at A (K18) first.  If white cuts at B (L12),
and black takes at C (L17), white has two liberties to black's
three.  So white must connect, and the exchange of A for L17
is clearly good for black.

But even connecting at K13 as black did is good for black.  K14
is aji-keshi for white because there is now no potential for that
cut left.  If white feels he must use the aji now, I think white K13
would be better than K14.  K13 is the eye-stealing tesuji (in relation
to M11).];W[id];B[jb];W[kc]C[J: I think this is unnecessary, or is W trying to keep B's top groups separated?

reid: Better for white to take the one stone in this case.  White
should not worry that black will continue with the peep at L18 -
now that black is connected with K13, the two M18/M17 stones
are worth almost nothing.  So the L18 peep is gote, and taking two
stones with L17 is gote again.  White should certainly be able to
save his group with two free moves.];B[hd]C[reid: Since white connected instead of taking, this is black's perogative.]
;W[ie];B[hc]C[J: I am not sure h16 and h17 are the best way to use k16 and take profit at the top. Is there a better local play?

H16 is OK, but H17 seems  bit slow.  I'd be tempted to just leave this for
now.  The best white can do is take K18 in gote anyway.];W[gf]
;B[dh];W[ch];B[df];W[ce];B[de];W[eg];B[dg];W[ij];B[hj];W[ig]
C[reid: Urk!  This move was black's sente.];B[ih];W[gi];B[cg]
C[reid: This is aji-keshi for black.  Better to leave it un-played.]
;W[bg];B[ej];W[fh];B[cj]C[J: B has a nice game. The left side is divided in two and the center group is not definitely alive. It should end up in a big capture.]
;W[bi];B[he]C[reid:  There is a basic principle of fighting here that
Black is not following (also in the previous fight for
the large white group on the right).  The principle is
you cannot kill a group unless is it surrounded.  And
if you cannot kill a group because it is not surrounded,
then there is not much point in taking "inside" moves.
It is usually better to take the outside move and force
your opponent to make eyes with a small territory.

Here white is not completely surrounded - the black
forces are a bit weak around the E10 stone.  So it is
dangerous for black to try to kill white so soon.

I think it would be much more interesting to start a new
attack with the idea of strengthening this weak part, and
see how good white is at juggling weak groups.

Try to find black's new attack - I'll put it into a later
diagram.];W[hg];B[hf]C[reid: This is not good for black.  At best, it loses a ko threat,
and at worst, black is using up his liberties.];W[if]C[reid:  Here would be a good place for black to start his
alternate attack.  Since he is worried about his center
group, it would be nice if there were another weak white
group in this area to even the balance of power.  See
the variation.]
(;B[ff];W[fj];B[ek];W[gg];B[hh]C[J: In sight of the future developement of the game, B should have played f9. After W h12 B c9 and B has won. Even if all W group managed to live, B would be 20 points ahead.]
;W[hi];B[ii];W[fk];B[el];W[fl];B[gh];W[fg];B[ei];W[fi];B[gm]
LB[hn:A]C[J: Only now B realises his central group needs attention.

reid:  But this is perhaps the *worst* way to handle it.

Black surely knows that white will respond with F7.  I call
this kind of exchange "squirting water out of a hose" (or
you can think of squeezing a watermelon seed between your
fingers until it pops out).   When your opponent drives between your positions this way,
it is *the* most effective form of splitting attack.

Black must instead pull back and get away from the white stones -
A (H6) would be better.];W[fm];B[gk]LB[gn:A][go:B]C[reid:  This is also terrible.  The proverb says "play away
from strength", not "play right next to strength".  Black
should just extend to A (G6) or jump to B G5.];W[gl];B[kf]C[reid: Urk!  one eye in gote.  Black deserves to lose this group
after these last three moves.];W[kh];B[kg]C[J: The last B's plays are nonsensical. Only now he realises j10 is a false eye!!]
;W[hl];B[dn];W[gn];B[ck];W[do]LB[gp:A]C[reid:  If white plays A (G4) to ensure the capture of the center
black group, and black plays D5 to get the side, then black has
about thiry in the bottom left, and 25 in the upper right.  The top
left is about 15.  If white plays first (it's white's sente after black
D5), black should only get about 10 or 12 points in the bottom
right corner.  The grand total is 80-85 points.

The center capture is worth about 70 points all by itself.  In addition
white has 10 at Q9, another 10 along the bottom after invading the
black lower right corner, and 8 on the left side for a total of nearly
100 points.

Clearly, white should not be trying to save these stones.];B[eo]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[en];B[fo];W[dm];B[fn];W[em];B[hn];W[go];B[ho]
;W[fp];B[hq];W[in]C[J: This is no good.

reid: yeah, white lost his chance now.  Peeping
first at J4 might work a bit better.];B[jn];W[ip];B[jo];W[jp]
;B[lp]C[J: Kikashi before living.];W[kp];B[io];W[qr];B[pr];W[qq]
;B[op]C[J: B is speculating with playing h4 and capturing. Maybe W should play h4 now, B defends the right corner, e3, e2, f2, d1 and B's lead is only 5 points.]
;W[rp];B[sr]LB[om:A]C[reid:  This looks like a "big-eye" situation.  First, white
should probe black with A (*P7).  See the variation.]
(;W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[hp];W[dr];B[ir];W[so];B[ro];W[oo]LB[om:B]
[qp:A]C[reid: as we saw in the variation, this is a key mistake.
White must play A (R4) instead.  But this whole fight depends
on who plays B (P7) first.];B[qp];W[po];B[rq]C[J: W resigned.

reid:  White had some chances at the end, but got distracted by
the fighting instead of concentrating on winning.

Black was distracted earlier and lost track of his center weakness.
But this is one of the significant differences between amateurs and
professionals - we are very erratic.

Interresting game, with some good fighting.  Black should learn
to fight earlier, particularly in handicap games.  It's best to use
the handicap stones early when black has a clear numeric superiority.

White should be careful about aji-keshi, partiularly in handicap games
where black may not recognize the severity of the aji.])

(;B[ck]LB[bk:C][ek:B][dl:A][cm:D]C[reid:  Now white has another weak group to
look after, and black is nicely placed to make
splitting moves between the two groups.

If white pulls up with A (D8), black is happy to make
a bamboo joint at B (E9).

White can still connect C8 to B11, but it will cost
him. Even if we just see white C (B9), black A, white
D (C7), black should have enough power to stop any
escape attempts by the white upper-middle group.

This position is a perfect example of what makes
go so much fun.  It's not just attacking and killing
(although that's certainly a lot of fun).  It's this subtle
working of one weakness against another to get an
advantage.  If the players get nothing else from this
game, I hope they can get a feel for this way of playing.]))
