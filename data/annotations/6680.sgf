C[hi! my comments will be preceded by [jeff\]

[jeff\] i made comments from a local perspective. however, go is not a game about locality, but one of strategic thinking.  since the outcome of the game is a consequence of the opening, the opening is the most important phase!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]LB[nc:A][qf:B][qj:C]C[[jeff\] widen your perspective by looking at the whole board! as you progress, this will become easier.

consider moves at the marked points.];B[jq]
(;W[ip];B[iq]
(;W[hq]
(;B[jc]LB[pj:A][qj:B]C[[jeff\] it seems as if black was trying to build a large moyo on the right side. consider white at A or B.]
;W[id]C[This move might not be the best, though I'm not sure.

[jeff\] this move was played too early. it actually makes black stronger since black plays J17, etc.]
;B[ic]
(;W[hc]C[Was hane appropriate here (as per the hane at the head of two stones proverb) or was it a poor play defensively?

[jeff\] this move leaves a weakness at H16 (black is already strong with the K17 group. white should have played H16 instead of this hane.]

(;B[hb];W[ib]C[Should I have performed another hane to G18, or was the cut appropriate? I was planning to try for the upper left corner.]
;B[jb];W[ia];B[ha];W[gb];B[ja];W[ga];B[gc];W[hd]C[This move does not seem the best, looking back considering my plan - was atari on F17 better?]
;B[fb];W[jj]C[This move I hoped would help get at least some center-bound framework.]
;B[ec]C[Upper left seems lost now or at least small... Is tenuki to put pressure on the right side (maybe using tengen and my triangle at H16) appropriate, or is fighting for the territory in the upper left still big enough?]
;W[dc]C[I wanted to try to possibly reduce black's expansion.]
;B[db]C[Doesn't work; I seem to be in a position where left side is more likely (as occured in the game itself).]
;W[cb]C[Still trying to reduce Black's corner; unfortunately, it seems like it has the side effect of enlarging his side.]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[fe];W[de];B[gd];W[da]C[Might be able to get something from that sequence, but it's clearly less than black.]
;B[eb];W[ff]C[Trying to expand to use my stone at tengen to build a larger framework.]
;B[gf];W[ef];B[je]LB[qn:A][qf:B][qc:C]C[I'm guessing H16 group is dead.

[jeff\] in this situation, K15 was a small move. there are still many big points throughout the board.]

(;W[qq]LB[qn:A][qf:B]C[Trying to steal a corner from black; however, things get messy.

[jeff\] this is fine, but playing kakari at A or B is better.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq]
(;W[rp]C[What was better - hane at S4, or extension at O2?

[jeff\] please see the variation];B[ro]
(;W[sp]C[[jeff\] white usually plays S3 instead of decending here. the reason is to gain sente later during the endgame. please consider the variation.]
;B[so];W[rq]C[Necessary?

[jeff\] very necessary. i usually play S3 here.];B[nr];W[ns]
C[P1 was probably the correct move.

[jeff\] after black's response to this move, white should abandon this corner as it is lost.]
;B[pr];W[os];B[ps];W[qr];B[ms];W[qs];B[sr]C[[jeff\] please consider this shape. T2 is kyusho. if white plays at T2, this shape will live; however, black got there first.]
;W[os]C[[jeff\] ineffectual. you should tenuki.];B[or];W[rr]
C[I just noticed - would T1 instead possibly create two eyes, or is this group unconditionally dead at this point (as of 61)?

[jeff\] this move is ineffectual. T2 was kyusho and since black played there, black took the lower right corner.]
;B[he];W[ir]LB[hp:A]C[[jeff\] please consider the weakness at A.]
;B[lq];W[kq];B[kp];W[kr];B[jr]
(;W[js]C[[jeff\] white should have taken advantage of black's mistake with K4.]
;B[jp];W[ks]C[Was J1 better?

[jeff\] white should have played H2.];B[hr];W[is];B[gr];W[gq]
;B[lr];W[ls]C[[jeff\] this move seems as if it was rushed. please consider your liberties.]
;B[hs];W[fr]LB[fq:A][hp:B]C[[jeff\] this move still leaves weaknesses at A and B. please consider these points carefully. locally, white should extend at A.]

(;W[cf]LB[qf:A][qc:B][qi:C][qo:D]C[[jeff\] it seems as if white was overly concerned with the life of this group. this move could have been played elsewhere. white can still make life by playing on any of the marked points.]
