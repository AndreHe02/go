C[Dear Reviewer,

as so often in this game I felt behind from the beginning. I'd like to have some advice in my opening in case you have any suggestions.

Thank you in advance for the time and energy you invest to review my game.

Kind Regards,
Germoe

Hello, 

I'm Thomas, you reviewer.

There is only a few things to say about this game :
 1) and most important, remember to never ever play a move like c2 again :-)
 2) remember to focus on important points
 3) remember the shape of the top right corner, do not let your opponent have it !
 4) don't miss the last chance ! you could have come back in the end of the game if you killed the invading black group at the top but you didn't even tried ! You were already behind in the game, so there is no time to play good-looking moves but try desperate moves.
And if this last point was caused by the fact that you didn't know you were behind, then add one more point :
 5) count !

Finaly, there is not much left to say. You opponent played well, doing only 1 big mistake in the beginning and not playing any useless move in the rest of the game. You needed more aggressivity but you waited for your opponent mistake, that never came. So you lost without doing anything.

Hope you will enjoy the review,

(;W[cr]C[fantomas : wrong move, should have been at b4];B[bp]
;W[bq];B[ci]C[After this I thought my shape was incomplete because black still has the KO at B2 and the forcing move at G4.

fantomas : the ko is not imporant right now because there is no threats yet on the board, so you don't have to worry about b2.
the result doesn't look that good for white, mainly because of c2.]

(;W[ip];B[ho];W[jp]C[I don't think this exchange was good for me, because I helped black to develop his influence and gained close to nothing in exchange.

(Thought about L3 but felt that giving black a good follow up at j5 wouldn't be good for w)

fantomas : i agree, j4 doesn't do any good];B[nq]C[uhh doesn't like w door still.

fantomas : yes, white's stones are quite strange now. Besides, now you have another problem : taking care of the right side or the left side ? Black probably won't let you do both]
;W[qj]C[fantomas : Personnaly, i would prefer to play on the left side because it is harder there for black to ignore you]
;B[dj];W[qf];B[pf]
(;W[qg];B[qe]C[I was pretty satisfied with this exchange since the corner is still open.

fantomas : this shape is called "tiger mouth shape", don't underestimate it, it is extremly powerfull. I prefer black a lot here.
That's why josekis say to play q13 instead of r13 here.];W[qn]
C[fantomas : white's shape is very low here, all the stones on the 3rd line]
;B[op];W[on];B[pg];W[qh]C[Hane better?

fantomas : definitly, yes];B[gk]C[fantomas : now you are a lot behind : you have 15 points in bottom left (at most), 15 on the right (at most again) and about 15 on the top side. = 45 points

On the other hand, black has, at least 35 points on the left side and 15 in the lowerright = 50 points, and the top right corner is not even included.

I think it is because you spent too many moves on the right side to make not that many points while black reinforced his bottom right corner and enlarged his territory on the left.
So you should probably have played on left side rather than on the right one earlier.]

fantomas : not me :-) black has already a big lead];B[ro]C[fantomas : HUGE, probably you should have played here before r17]
;W[oi]C[fantomas : strange move, it doesn't make any points nor protect any group. why not s6 instead ?]

(;W[bp]C[fantomas : In this situation (atari on the 3rd line) you must always try to escape once (like this move) so that your oppoenet has to play more stones if he wants to capture yours.]
