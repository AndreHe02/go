AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Okay, so first off I want to say that I was expecting to end up losing this game by some ridiculous margin.  As you'll see, it ended up being a very close game.  I'm not very good at asking questions, since I have a hard time recognizing mistakes I've made unless they are very obvious. I really hope that you can perhaps help me understand my strengths and weaknesses in this game, and perhaps good ways to study to improve.  I really appreciate it!  :3

J: Hi.
My name is Joe. I am roughly 2d AGA. Thanks for submitting your game to the GTL. 
I've added several comments and variations to this review. All of my comments are marked with a "J:".
I've also included a summary at the end. 

Enjoy.];W[jj]C["ya9918jpjp [1d\]: hi"

;B[jc]C[I don't usually play many handicap games, but I remember a long time ago someone telling me to make use of the stones I have on the board, so I try to start making frameworks.  Is there a better way to go about it?

J: With 6 stones, you already have great frameworks. You start off with the left and right, and this move is great for starting a framework on the top.

As far as the best approach for using your handicap, I prefer to use my stones to attack from. It's a matter of style.]
;W[jp]
(;B[mc]LB[mc:A][nd:B][je:D][qf:C]C[J: This move feels like you are playing in your own territory to an extent. In addition, it doesn't do much to effect the corner. White still has 3-3 point (R17) available and other corner options.

If you are trying to build from your corner, I would prefer R14 or O16 to maintain a high-low relationship with their respective side stones.

If you would like to build from your side stone, a move at K15 gives your framework some depth.

My preference would be a play on the bottom side to build up a corner while threatening to apply pressure to the white stone there.]
;W[qd]
(;B[gc]LB[gc:A][cf:B]C[J: This move is slow.

You already made K17 very strong by playing N17.

White would not want to play in this area, because he would be pressured and have very little chance to attack.

If you wanted to help this area, it would be better to play around C14. White would have a hard time playing around here after that.]

(;B[cp]LB[do:B][cp:A];W[bm];B[fq]TR[bm]C[In a normal game, would this exchange be considered joseki?  Does anything like this exchange ever even happen in a normal game?

J: Coming down with B7 (marked) is a bit aggressive. White is using this stone to seperate your groups so he can attack the stones above.
Normal play here for white would be to jump out towards the center in order to ensure the safety of his stones.]
;W[dg];B[fk]C[My idea here was to try to put pressure on w while aiming to try and connect with the b group on top, or at the very least, make more room for eye space.

J: This is the right idea.

These are your weakest stones, and white will need to add a move to jump out with his D7 group since he neglected this earlier.]

J: Another move here is needed to ensure life. The only problem with your choice is it doesn't defend against a white monkey jump from S6.

A play at S5 secures the most territory, but if you are looking to minimize the trouble that white can cause, you may also consider S4 or R3.]

C[Is it possible that it would have been better to atari from the other side?  I wasn't really sure if the group was savable.

J: This is the right idea. The group does not appear to be easy to save. 

If you do not succeed in saving it, then white would be eating a larger group.
If you did save it, then you're likely to suffer somewhere else.]

[rf:A]C[J: This is a small endgame play, since you are open on the top side. You will need another play at B14 to surround points on the side.

Some bigger endgame points are marked (A, B & C). 
A appears to be the biggest because in addition to securing territory, it also prevents white from threatening the life of your group.
B is also big, because it has a followup at A17.
C is not nearly as big as A & B, but it doesn't require a followup to secure territory as your choice did.]

J: See my comments at move 178 (B9) for earlier endgame.

When looking for endgame moves, look for moves that have a followup for either side.
Here D19 has a good followup for each side and is the largest endgame move left.]

J: You played well in this game. However, I think you would get a lot more out of having an even game reviewed.
In this game, you recieved a large handicap and you played very timid to avoid fights.

Avoiding fights is generally favorable for black when taking 6 stones, so this was not wrong of you. It just makes it much more difficult to identify where you need to work. You would not play so conservative if you didn't recieve a handicap, so I don't believe this game is typical of your style.

You only made a few serious mistakes in this game, and they were usually shape related. You will naturally correct this as you get more games in. 

My only advise is to play more games and if you ever get the chance to take 6 stones again, pick a fight. :)

If you have any questions I didn't answer, please feel free to contact me.
