C[ben87 [8k\]: hi gg
Taucetil [7k?\]: hi !

Thx reviewing my game :o)

I'm interesting knowing my biggest mistakes ?
Is the early fuseki ok ?

Ben.  Hi I am Ben and will be reviewing your game (note I am not the black player in this game - we simply have the same  name!).  My impression of your early fuseki is that you did quite well.  I think your struggles were with the middlegame, especially on the transitions from opening to middlegame and on middlegame to endgame mostly and making the most of your stones and being able to punish some of black's unusual moves.  Both of you missed some quite large plays for quite a long time, you both seemed to overvalue making territory that was worth only 5-10 points while there were plays that were worth more points more elsewhere on the board.  You seem to have a good knowledge of shape and you did a fairly good job at tenuki when your opponent played slowly (although there were a couple times you could have used tenuki earlier and I point these out).  I think some useful things for you to study would be when and how to follow up from standard opening shapes, so probably reveiwing games like this and playing over professional games could help in this regard.  Other things to work on would consist of creating/ removing aji and how to counter an opponents moyo.  Some of this just comes with experience, puzzle solving, and studying along with others.]
;B[pc]C[Taucetil [7k?\]: gg];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qe];W[jc]C[Ben.  This is the most orthodox approach to the black shimari.]
;B[fq];W[cn]C[Ben.  A standard reply.];B[iq]C[Ben.  A mistake, of sorts, white may kick with e3 now.]

(;W[qn];B[nq]C[Ben.  The move o4 would have have been more to my taste, he has a lot of stones on the 3rd line on the bottom now.]
;W[pj]C[Ben.  This is fine.];B[cf];W[di];B[ef];W[fd]
(;B[ch]C[Ben.  Another small mistake from your opponent, black can settle his shape more clearly with b11 instead, see variation.]
;W[ci]C[Ben.  When you play close to your opponent as black did here, you make your opponents weak stones stronger when they reply - d11 was a week isolated stone, by not playing lightly black has given white an opportunity to make a fast shape into an ideal shape on the bottom left.]
;B[dh]
(;W[cd]C[Ben.  Although you really ought to play at e11 now.]
;B[ei]SQ[ef]MA[eh]C[Ben.  This hane however is quite good, white should not allow it.  Note how the marked stone helps prevent white from cutting.]

(;W[dk];B[rp];W[mc]C[Ben.  I probably would have avoided this myself, it is indeed a big point but I would be nervous that black can begin constructing a large moyo now with a play around q8 (see variations).]

(;B[qh]C[Ben.  Black returns the favor, now white can try to settle his shape here in relative comfort, or just run away.]

(;W[je]SQ[kp]C[Knowing the rest of the game, this stone should probably try to reduce the south border and help my R6 group ? Something around 06 ?

Ben.  Correct, I believe o6 is possible, that's probably a "fast" way to settle the shape, p6 seems plausible as well, as does s10 and s5.  K15 is a bit premature, and possibly not the best locally (maybe g14, or a probe like q18 are in order) probably even if r6 was settled, in that I case I might try for something about l4 (but settling r6 first is clearly priority).]
;B[on]C[Ben.  Black begins building a moyo, this is a very direct way to do it, I would prefer trying to split white's marked stones as I built my moyo.]
;W[pm];B[dr];W[cq];B[rj]C[Ben.  If I were black I would just keeping growing my moyo; p7, or maybe f6.

As white here, I would treat the stones lightly and try to just run out, there are really no "points" to be had on this bottom side now.]

(;W[rk]
(;B[qj];W[qk];B[pi];W[oj];B[oi];W[nj];B[gn]C[Ben.  Your opponent seems to have started on the right track.]

(;W[mn]SQ[nj][oj][pj][pm][qk][qn][rk]C[Trying to reduce the black south area... Better around L5 ?

Ben.  I wish I could tell you, the marked group isn't exactly settled yet either which makes any kind of deeper invation that much more risky.  The play you come up with in the game (at n6) actually worked out quite well for you, although I don't think he responded as strongly as he could have.  Best advice I could give here is try not to let it get to this point.]
;B[nm];W[ll];B[mm];W[lm];B[ln]C[Ben.  There is indeed this cutting point, however hindsight is 20/20 and it probably would have been better for him to avoid using it and just take territory at the bottom (with something like m4) or split white at n9 instead.]
;W[kn];B[lo];W[ko]
(;B[lp]C[Ben.  At first I thought the cut at l4 was the way to go but that also results in white breaking through.]
;W[jl]C[Ben.  This is a good play, possibly making an eye at l7 and covering the cutting point there.]
;B[ni]C[Ben.  A little slow for him, why not just n9 and cut the weak white groups?]
;W[mj];B[nd]
(;W[mi]C[Probably better at M12 ? 

Ben.  That would be the ideal shape locally I suspect, but as I will show there are other bigger moves elsewhere on the board.]
;B[mh];W[nh]C[Ben.  Unfortunately this just doesn't work, perhaps just m12 instead?]

(;B[ng];W[mg];B[lh];W[nf];B[og];W[mf]SQ[lh]C[Ben.  This marked stone is unfortunate for you.]
;B[of];W[md];B[ne];W[me]
(;B[nc]C[Ben.  Im not really sure how necessary this move is for black, but it is admittedly a little annoying to allow p18 or o17 for white - im just not convinced these moves just aren't the biggest on the board at the moment.]

(;W[nb]C[Ben.  This looks a little small to me.  See alternatives.]
;B[ob];W[mb];B[gf]
(;W[he]C[Ben.  Your so strong in this area I am not sure this move is necessary now (what's the worst he can do?), other moves already shown look bigger still to me.]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[hf];W[if]C[Ben.  Again what's the worst he can do?  Tenuki.]
;B[ej]
(;W[ek]C[Ben.  This leaves behind a weakness, maybe a bamboo joint instead?]

(;B[bi];W[ck]C[Ben.  Probably best.];B[gj];W[ig]C[Ben.  Kind of small.  C2 and l4 are both still quite large.]

Ben.  Black's play is bad but not because he is going to die, rather he is losing out on the battle for influence.  Unfortunately I don't think this hane does much for you, he can still make a reasonably live shape and then you would be left with the cutting point on e11.

I am guessing black would go b16 next and he would have a live shape as the marked black stones, although overconcentrated, are at least good at making an eye.]
