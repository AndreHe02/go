AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, and thank you for taking the time to review this! I've marked some moves on which I'd like you to comment, but please do comment on the game as a whole, too.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[qf]
(;B[md]C[Upon doing some research later I found that the standard continuation in this position would be black O16 rather than N16. Is N16 a tad too far?

----------
It's kind of a loose move, it leaves white a lot more room if he goes in to the 3-3]

(;W[pj]
(;B[qe]C[----------
This is something to wait on. Before this, white's side is more invadable. R15 just encourages white to wall up, but doesn't remove the possibility of R17 for white. R16 would be a better way to wall up the corner.]

(;B[jp];W[cf];B[df];W[dg];B[ef];W[ce];B[cd];W[gd]C[A deviation from standard joseki; I was a bit startled. Considering the following moves, is there a comment you can make on my answer? I was confused with this one.]
;B[fc]C[----------
This response is fine. It preserves the cutting point and undermines white's attacking stone.]
;W[fd];B[ed];W[gc]C[----------
This is where the top fell apart. It's more important here to just defend than try to attack, since white gets an easier life capturing F17.]

(;B[jc];W[ec];B[db];W[eb];B[dc];W[fb]C[----------
All your groups are pretty strong and safe at this point, so it's a good time to take the offense.]

(;B[fn]C[I thought I could still save the corner if white invaded it now (so I tried to save my E5 stone) but that turned out to be untrue. Was losing the corner due to my inablity to respond correctly, or was there no way to save it after white's invasion in the following move?]

(;B[em];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[cq];W[br]C[Maybe I should have resigned here, but I thought I had a chance if I could kill both the white weak groups at the upper left... was it too far-fetched?

----------
Loss of the lower left hurts, but the game is far from over once black takes down white's C14 group.]

Overplay by white looking for his last chance I think. You can cut this off without fear.]

In general, what do you think was the determining factor of my loss; losing the lower left corner? Neglecting the rest of the board to attack white's weak groups? Or maybe that kind of thinking was correct in theory, but I simply didn't have the ability to follow up on it?

Thanks again for the review!]N[RESULT])

White can take some corner but since he could have invaded all along it isn't as bad as losing the top group and corner both.]

Invading around here or at R3 (or both depending how things go) could be a big hit and swing the game in blacks' favor again. Some are long shots, but possible all the same.]

Attack white a litlte more loosely. The K14 jump made White's push at K15 painful and ultimately endangers the K17 stones.]

If you're willing to play a game of moyos, the sanrensei works better with the top right, working towards a bigger overall moyo.]
