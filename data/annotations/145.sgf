 Kang 13k*: fake 23k  :(];W[gd];B[df];W[jf];B[le]L[nf]C[Rob- Well, in the books,  they seem to think that you should give up the k16 stone here, and build up  thickness on the outside of w's 30 pts..

I've never been able to follow such a policy myself. :) However, if one were  to try, I think a would be a good way to start.]
;W[nf]L[ph][qh]C[Rob- Now  here, I would absolutely a. Maybe even as wimpy (or as brave) as b.]
;B[lg];W[ld];B[ke];W[ph]C[Rob- See, this is the BIGGEST point  around. You CAN'T let w get this, no matter what.]

 Kang 13k*: what to do?  what to do ? .....
 rich 23k*: hard to play w in high hcap game :(
 Kang 13k*: real hard  for a 13k  :(
 Kang 13k*: against a good 23k :(
 rich 23k*: thanks
 rich 23k*: what usually happens in these games
 Kang 13k*: welcome
 rich 23k*: is that later on your superior fighting
 Kang 13k*: is that w kills something
 rich 23k*: will start to kill my stones :(
 Kang 13k*: yes
 Kang 13k*: lemme c...];W[ng];B[oh];W[dh];B[eg];W[ei]C[
 rich 23k*: always try to keep w separated...
 Kang 13k*: good];B[ej]L[dm]C[
 Kang 13k*: b should utilize its thickness

Rob- In an even game, this is a reasonable move. In an h-9 game, I really  feel that a is better.]
;W[fi];B[gg]L[dm][pm]C[Rob- Now I feel that b MUST a  or maybe b.]
;W[ff];B[fg];W[dc]C[
 Kang 13k*: first test  :)];B[cc];W[ed];B[de];W[db];B[bg]C[Kang said this  move was slow. I intended it to undercut d12 group and give my group
a base, but it allows w to take a big point in the center.

Rob- b13 is slow. However, slow is not necessarily bad in hi h-cap games.]
;W[jh]C[
 Kang 13k*: b13 slow];B[li];W[ki]C[
 rich 23k*: thanks Kang I see that now];B[lj]C[
 Kang 13k*: even tho it deprived d12 a base];W[kj]C[
 rich 23k*: deprive d12 + defend was my idea
 Kang 13k*: i know];B[kg]L[lh]C[
 Kang 13k*: but it would be hard for d12 to get a base there anyway

Not a good move I think.  I was worried that w could cut me, and this move  was intended
as a sente peep to strengthen my connection.  But (1) w didn't treat it as  sente, and
(2) w could still cut me at 'a' I think.  Seems much more important to save  k10 stone, which w prompty pounces on.

Rob- Right. and the reason w pounces is that the l11 string is weak as hell.]
;W[jk];B[jg]C[Since I had peeped and he didn't respond, I felt obligated to  cut him.  Giving w a ponnuki in the exact center of the board was a disaster!   With his ponnuki his center group was strong, and his top left group was  also strong enough, so the cut was small.   Rob- Basically, cutting one living group into two.

This was what I call a "reflex move" - I made the move on the basis of local  shape without really thinking about it.]
;W[ij]C[
 Kang 13k*: u deprive w a base on the side but gave it a ponuki in the center]
;B[if];W[ie];B[ig]C[Well at least I was able to remove the threat of the cut  at n12 by connecting to the left.]
;W[id];B[jc];W[je];B[kd];W[qc];B[qd]L[ob]C[Seems  'a' would be better, since the w string at o17 would have a tough time making  room for eyes.  I wanted to block w off from my territory, but the net result  is to give those w stones at o17 a nice base.

Rob- Actually, I think that r16 is fine.];W[ob];B[hc]M[jc][jd][kd][ke]
[le][lg][kg][li][lj][jg][ig][if]L[pm]C[Rob- My  feeling here is..If you are going to play strong, and take sente here, why  not use the r16 move and do a! That gets you a TON of points :)

At this point, the marked group is not in any danger at all. It's connected!  The only point of h17 is to make an eye on the edge, which you really don't  need. Be greedy, take the points! :)]
;W[pc];B[od];W[ic];B[ib];W[jb];B[kb];W[hb]C[
 rich 23k*: lice way to make life :)
 Kang 13k*: but w's trouble is not over yet...];B[ja];W[gb]C[
 Kang 13k*: ....];B[he]L[mb][pm][qm][dm]C[As Kang points out later, 'a' is much tougher here.   Again I thought this was sente but w chose to give up his stones at j15.   This is a big difference from playing low kyu players.  Against a low kyu my  move would definately be sente :(

Rob- Right, but I must admit, even though a is nasty to w, I'd really want to  do b now :) Maybe even c, or even d!
I know, it isn't sente, but taking big moves in h-9 is really important, I  think. If you use sente to do stuff like that (if groups aren't in danger),  then you can't lose against someone close enough to you in strength (like  Kang is).]
;W[mb]C[
 Kang 13k*: b n18 would've made w very miserable

 Kang 13k*: :)];B[hd];W[cb];B[bc];W[dm]C[
 rich 23k*: seems good time for you to tennuki
 Kang 13k*: had to

Rob- Ouch. Look how much better off you would be if you had taken that move.]
;B[fp];W[cp];B[co]C[
 rich 23k*: experimenting...
 Kang 13k*: same here actually...];W[bo];B[cq]C[
 Kang 13k*: c5 very good

Rob- Kang is right. c5 is a scary move for w to see. I feel his follow up was  a bit slack, but..]
;W[cn];B[bp];W[do];B[cp]C[
 Kang 13k*: hehe

Jeez. I have to get over this fear of ko I have.  This makes my move at c5  ridiculous.

Rob - Yeah, at this point there is little reason to avoid the ko.];W[bm]

 rich 23k*: I don't read very deep :)];B[eo]L[bi][pm]C[
 Kang 13k*: think b could've won that ko easily
 Kang 13k*: i was banking on ....
 rich 23k*: probably right - I'm inordinately scared of kos :(

Rob- Right here, you could extract those 2 stones with a. Or, he said, like a  broken record, do b. :)]
;W[bh];B[cg];W[ch];B[el]L[fm]C[I  realized these stones were starting to be swallowed by white, so I intended  this
as a running move, but it was obviously insufficient.  A move at 'a' would  take a big point and offer to give up these 2 stones in exchange for a big  bottom.

Rob - Yeah, I agree.   Though I can't comment about the big bottom. :)]
;W[fm];B[fl]C[Not sufficient.   I don't see a good way to save these stones, so maybe I should
pressure from the outside and threaten to link up with them, building  territory on  the outside in the process.

Rob- Beyond any shadow of a doubt, you are right.];W[gm];B[dn];W[em];B[cl]
C[Now my idea is to make enough room to live here.

 rich 23k*: oops
 Kang 13k*: ?

My "oops" was because I noticed that w only can play at 'a' now to capture  the marked
stones, forcing me to capture at a12, and then can close off my incursion in  sente when
he captures at b10 and seals at a8.  But I guess w wanted to capture b  outright here.]

 rich 23k*: if you had c9 instead of a12 I was lost :)
 Kang 13k*: hmmm];B[pb]L[ck][gc]C[This was the biggest ko threat I could find,  as it seemed w would have a hard time living here if he ignored it.  I'm not  good at finding ko threats (which is one reason I don't like ko).  What other  threats look interesting to you?

Rob- q18 is a fine threat. a and b seem other good ones.];W[ck]C[
 rich 23k*: not big enough I suppose];B[qb]C[
