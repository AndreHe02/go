C[Thanks for taking the time out to review this game for me.I am the person who plays black(masterlcm). I have gone over the game once angain and I know I am not strong enough. Would you mind to give suggestions on moves where you think a bigger extension would be better or a better move gobally would be better? Also, could you point out which move is a crude style? I would appreciate any advice to improving my game.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp]C[this move is fine though personally i like to attack an opponents corner...]
;W[jd];B[dj]SQ[cf][df][pf][qf]C[although this is a big point, now would be the time to attack somewhere on the marked points. Its important to attack from this side to profit from your stones on the lower side. Your move looks a little bit too passive to me.]
;W[fq]C[too early for white, somewhere around R6 would have been better for the same reasons as stated before. This is a move which black can be thankful for because while it makes it easy for black to gain territory while attacking this weak white stone, white has to struggle to get a base.]

(;B[cn]LB[dj:A][jp:B]C[regarding the circumstances this is too passive. Black can make use of the stone at B and play for example like in the variation and white is in trouble.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[jq];W[ip];B[io]C[correct move, hane at the head of two!]
;W[qn]C[mistake by white, a responce to J5 is absolutely necessary. By playing R6 he invites a serious attack on his G3 group later on and risks being imprisoned.]
;B[ql];W[on];B[np];W[pk];B[qk];W[pj]
(;B[qi]C[this jump came one move too early];W[qj];B[rj]
(;W[qg]TR[pj][pk][on][qn]C[bad move, white can tear black apart if he wants to. The marked white group still is not connected. If white intends to take black eyespace away and attack the whole group S12 would be the move]
;B[pi]TR[pl]C[wrong move i think, better come out at Q8 and try to cut]
;W[rh];B[ri];W[md];B[qc]TR[pl]C[no need for that yet, white wont waste a move securing that corner right now. More urgent is either to attack the lower group or to play Q8 and cut white. at this point i would always prefer black to white, because blacks position is more solid all over the board. White should get punished for leaving such weak groups lying around]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[qe]
(;B[re];W[qf];B[rf];W[qb];B[rb];W[pb];B[sh]C[perhaps it is better here to take the corner with S19 instead of connecting]
;W[rg];B[sg];W[ra];B[rc]
(;W[sb];B[sf];W[sd];B[rd];W[og]LB[jd:A][md:B]C[now lets consider the outcome of the invasion of the corner. While black gets at most 3-4 points, white gets a huge wall on the outside which relates nicely with the two stones at A and B. This is a desaster for black.

If black has to invade it should rather be done like in the variation although it should be left for later as white gets a pretty strong position here too.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ef]C[nicely done, black is building a good moyo.]
;W[hd]
(;B[fo];W[gp];B[ho]C[you had the right idea to imprison white here. This truly must hurt :)]
;W[dl]C[this invasion is way too deep. should make life easy for black]

(;B[cl]C[NEVER (or at least nearly never) attack a single stone (or a weak group for that matter) through attaching a stone. This only invites fighting and the weak attacked stone will profit. The correct way is to attack from distance and take territory and influence elsewhere while the attacked group has to run away.]

(;B[jj]LB[ke:A]C[black should have never allowed white to connect down there.


Now this move doesnt do anything. Black has to lessen whites influence on the top, my preferred move would be A]
;W[ii];B[ij]C[too passive this way you wont hardly make any territory. Playing somewhere in front of a big wall of yours and hoping to get points is the wrong strategy. Thickness can only be use to attack, the territory comes as a byprodukt]

I hope this review will help you.
