C[Munisai:  Thank you in advance, reviewer.  I really appreciate getting a more experienced player's perspective.

Munisai:  I made quite a few reading errors in this game, and I'm working on life and death problems to improve that facet of my game.  More importantly, I think I blew an early lead in this game by allowing myself to be closed in.  Could you point out times in the game where I am too conservative or miss an urgent play?  Thank you, again!

freehold:

As a general comment, pay more attention to sente.];B[pd];W[pp]
;B[cd];W[dq];B[ic]C[Munisai:  Trying out low Chinese opening...  I'm normally an influence player.]
;W[jq];B[co];W[eo];B[dn];W[qj]C[Munisai:  I think white loses a chance here.  C11 seems stronger.

freehold:Agreed, at least a little stronger.];B[dj];W[cf];B[ed]
;W[bi];B[ci];W[ch];B[bj];W[ah]C[freehold:I would play at D11 first if I were W]
;B[be]C[freehold:D11 (W) and D12 (B) is an instance of mutually exclusive sente. Usually, you want to be the first to take it.]
;W[eg];B[fi];W[gg];B[hi];W[ge];B[gd];W[if];B[fe];W[ff];B[he]
;W[gf];B[hf];W[hg];B[ig];W[ie];B[hd];W[ke];B[ih];W[ee];B[de]
C[freehold:

This move is a mistake because it leaves you thin. Don't do this unless you see a way to capture stones. Better is F16, which is sente.]
;W[fd];B[fc];W[df];B[bf];W[bg]C[Munisai:  In retrospect, I feel that I should have left well enough alone here and played at M16 or M17 to attack the floating white group and make some territory.

freehold:

You should also think the steady L17
Attacking at D12 next is the right thing to do, as it makes you thicker.]
;B[dh];W[dg];B[ec]C[freehold:

I don't think this move is absolutely needed, although an argument can be make for protecting yourself. However. in any case, it is better to play F15 first; at least make your opponent waste the ko threat. After he retakes the ko you can always make this move.]
;W[fe];B[eh]C[freehold:

F12 is better since it is sente, even though it leaves some forcing moves behind in your structure.]
;W[id];B[jc];W[kd];B[qg]C[freehold:

I would keep the pressure on at L17 while also making edge territory.]
;W[kg];B[qn]C[Munisai:  I feel like I need to disrupt white's framework, and R10 looks lonely right now.  Also, if I get thrown into the center, I might be able to isolate the group currently in the center.  I'm not sure if a move at N17 is bigger, though...

freehold:

Either seems reasonable.];W[np];B[ql];W[oj];B[rp];W[qp];B[qo]
C[freehold:

S3 is much better. This move does very little for you.];W[rq]
;B[so];W[qq]C[Munisai:  I changed my plans and made a base, instead.  In retrospect, I believe this was a big mistake.

 freehold:

The big mistake was R5. Given that, making a base was understandable.]
;B[gp]C[Munisai:  My aim is to press white into a low position here and develop some center influence.  This doesn't really feel like the right move, but I still can't put my finger on a better one.

Freehold:

This seems a pretty good move. I think I would have chosen P7 first, putting a little pressue on the stones at P10 and R10 and making your group hard to contain.]
;W[gq]C[freehold:

A go proverb: when trying to make stones in your opponent's territory, play in contact with his weak stones.

The reason this works is because you can make shape as you threaten them. Therefore, this move by W is questionable and so is your follow on move. The moves can be defended since this is not solidly W's territory.]
;B[fp]C[freehold:

either F3 or H3 would be better, threatening to cut on one side or the other of the G3 stone.]
;W[fq];B[fn]C[freehold:

I would press through and cut with the sequence:
B E4 W D4 B D5

Now E5 belongs to B, with the threat of E3 remaining.];W[ep]
;B[gn];W[hl];B[gl]C[Munisai:  White was passive until now, so my move worked, but I think white's response shouldn't have been so submissive.

freehold:

While not great, W's moves are understandable and have solidified territory on the bottom edge.]
;W[hm];B[hp];W[gm];B[fm];W[gk];B[fk];W[gj];B[gi];W[fl];B[el]
;W[gl]C[freehold:

I think W should have pressed in at G10 instead of filling here.]
;B[ek]C[freehold:


good move];W[jm];B[jo];W[qc]C[Munisai:  I think the center group can live easily enough, at this point, so I decide to push white to the top and take some side territory.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[rc]C[freehold:

I think the other side is better, because it threatens his upper center group. If you wanted this side, you should have played the joseki with O18 ratther than O17.]
;W[mc];B[pb]C[freehold:

I think this is a bad move. Much better is S18, which is sente.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pa];B[ne]C[freehold:

you can play N16 safely here, because it threatens N18 M17 M18 with the threat of O19 in reserve.]
;W[md];B[nd];W[me];B[ng]C[freehold:

You should extend to O14 rather than jump. This is in a way an application of the proverb that you generally want to crawl three steps before shifting or jumping.]
;W[pg];B[pf];W[ph];B[qh];W[qi];B[rk]C[Munisai:  I feel that this group is now in trouble, so I made a move to defend it.  Jumping out to threaten a connection with the left side is stronger, though, now that I look back.

Munisai:  Unfortunately, this means the top group is open to attack, and I start making reading errors.]
;W[of];B[nf]C[Munisai:  This move should have been at R14.  The one stone isn't worth saving.

freehold: I disagree; getting your snake out into the center is worth a lot more than a point.]
;W[qf];B[pe]C[freehold:

this is the mistake. You should have played at S14 instead, sacrificing Q14 in Sente.]
;W[rg];B[rh]C[freehold:

oops];W[ri];B[rf];W[sh];B[qe]C[freehold:

the correct move is S15];W[ol];B[qg];W[qh];B[jj]C[Munisai:  Reducing.]
;W[kk];B[kj];W[lk];B[lj];W[ko];B[nn]C[Munisai:  Overplay, but I feel that I am behind, now.  White has the bottom and maybe some center territory.  I have the top left and a small left side territory.

Munisai:  I compound the problem with some more short-sightedness....]
;W[on];B[om];W[nm];B[pn]C[freehold:

Q7 is better];W[oo];B[nl];W[pm];B[pl];W[ok];B[mk];W[ml];B[nk]
C[freehold:

oops];W[mj];B[mi];W[nj];B[cq]C[Munisai:  Having thoroughly messed up the right side, I try to take part of the bottom left corner.]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[dp];W[er];B[hq]C[Munisai:  More reducing...]
;W[hr];B[jk]C[freehold:

J2 is bigger and sente];W[jn];B[jl];W[kl];B[qm]C[freehold:

too early. J2 is still calling; and M18 is also sizable];W[io]
;B[ip]C[freehold:

too small];W[jp];B[in]C[freehold:

oops];W[im]C[freehold:

W should have taken B with H6];B[hn];W[en];B[em];W[aq];B[bp]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[lb];B[ja];W[mg];B[lh]C[freehold:

J2 is still bigger. In this area, you can push at N14 first]
;W[lg];B[kh];W[og];B[oe]C[freehold:

O12 is better];W[mh];B[nh];W[ni];B[li];W[qk];B[rj];W[iq]C[freehold:

finally!];B[aj];W[ai];B[af];W[ag]C[freehold:

notice the weakness left behind at C15];B[ra];W[qa];B[sf];W[sg]
;B[sj];W[si];B[jg]C[Munisai:  I didn't even notice R8.

freehold:

neither did W, apparently];W[jf];B[ap];W[ar];B[rn]C[Munisai:  This was an unfortunate misclick.  I saw R8 and was going to play a stone on it.]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[sl];B[sm];W[sk];B[sq];W[rr];B[sp]C[Munisai:  Playing without thinking.  Should have taken T2.]
