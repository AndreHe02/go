;W[cq];B[fc];W[eg]C[This is a bit odd for white.  fifth line stones don't really hold the side very well, and the centre is not that important yet.]
;B[db];W[cc]
(;B[id]C[This is somewhat strange also.  H17 is a large weak point.  The usual place for this kind of move is H16, or the very standard J17.  See variation for H16]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[White helps you fix your shape by encouraging you to play M17.]

(;B[sn]C[There is no need to play this sente move right now.  White must respond, but it can be used as a big ko threat.  Also, see variation for why white is in no rush to play any move around here, so that bT6 is black's at almost any point in the game.]
;W[rp]
(;B[np];W[mq]C[O4 seems to help white make himself stronger.  This is the usual move made to deal with the aji of a lone stone against a black wall after this 3x3 point corner invasion joseki, but here O3 is not alone.  M4 or N3 might have been better.  see variations]
;B[io];W[hp]
(;B[ip];W[hq];B[hr];W[gr];B[ir];W[gq]C[Saving the J4 stone is just not worth being cut apart like this.  Check the variations for move 43.]

(;B[mp]C[This encourages white to make nice shape here.  See variations for a move that guts white.]
;W[lp]C[White is nicely connected now];B[jp]C[Obviously, this does not threaten a cut.  Black would be better off jumping to J7.]
;W[gn];B[lo];W[kp];B[kn]C[This attack is much too thin.  White will easily come through it, and the J5 group could easily end up captured as it is eyeless, and alone.]
;W[ln];B[mo];W[jn];B[km];W[jo];B[ls]C[J5 is looking very unhappy.]

;W[sq];B[sn];W[ss]C[I think black here had trouble reading out situations.   Some life and death problems would likely be a good way to practice reading.

(;B[sm];W[rp]C[White gets another point from T6, but as you can see, black still has a huge sente move at T7.  White has only gained 1 point, but hasn't removed the sente threat against the corner, so white doesn't play this way.]

And black is likely to play T7 before the end game anyways as it is such a huge ko threat.  Black got J5 and K7 in exchange for losing just 9 point on the right, and they are a nice start to an attack on the L3 group, that might even kill it.

Q13 prevents some weirdness that starts with wR8.]))))
(;B[hd]C[This is a joseki.  It feels lie to works here for black as E13 is very high, so black needs to start playing high, so J17 would not be high enough.  Plus, it seems to work well with Q16.  Black must be prepared for wK17 at some point, but I don't think making life will be hard.]
