- you're pushing from behind
- you're playing close to strong stones

- it doesn't help you create any territory];B[mi];W[ph];B[qg]

(;W[co]C[this is a move that looks like you're trying to kill his stones -- it would be much easier for you to let him live small in gote.

I'm not saying it is neccessarily a bad move, but you shouldn't play it if you haven't read out the entire 20 move long sequence and you're 100% sure you can kill him.]

[ij][kj][mj][ak][ck][ek][kq][ls][ms]C[The two moves I'd like to highlight as losing moves are 80 (C5) and 150(D18) -- both are strong attacks that have no basis in reading. As a result of these two attacks, your shape was destroyed (amarigatachi -- overextended with too many weak points) and instead of your opponent having to give you thickness and profit in return for life, you got nothing. I think you should stop trying to kill your opponent's stones if you don't _know_ that they are possible to kill.

Try not - Do or do not, there is no try.])
