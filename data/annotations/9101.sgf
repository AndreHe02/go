C[Hi,

I played Black in this game.  There were
attacks on big groups, in which I made some clumsy moves at some key points. I would
be grateful for correction of mistakes in the fighting, as well as mistakes in overall direction of play; and I botched a joseki, too.

I stopped recording at move 106, but two important battles had occurred by then.

Thank you!

Hello, Fred,

I am Bernd, European 2d, HonFu in the GTL and other go places. So let's see what we got here!]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[qp];B[do]C[Was B5 at a proper point?

Hon: Perfect point; I have actually never seen another move in this position. The approach move develops D16 and prevents the shimari at the same time.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp]
(;B[dm]LB[ci:A]C[Hon: This move is also joseki, but you normally play it when you want to extend to A.]
;W[fq];B[cj]LB[dn:A]TR[dm]C[Hon: If you only extend to this point, as it works well with D16, you would prefer to have the marked stone at A now.]
;W[en]LB[em:a]C[I thought hard about whether I should respond to this, but in the end I did.  Would
B13 at A been a playable response?]
(;B[dn]C[Hon: This is the proper move.];W[fc];B[hc]LB[cf:a]
[df:b]C[Pincer seemed better than responding at A or B.

Hon: I think, B is also playable.];W[cf]C[I didn't expect this, and I don't think I responded well.]

(;B[df];W[cc];B[ce];W[dc]C[Hon: This is a bit strange, because you build thickness in front of your tightly living group, while the upper side, still wide and developable, remains thin and open to invasion. 

Also White's stone still has aji.]
(;B[ed]C[I didn't want to see a W stone at 21.

Hon: I understand your feeling, but this peep also looks a bit like ajikeshi. The stone does not add a lot to your position, but on the other hand you strengthen white considerably.]
;W[ec];B[ge]LB[qj:A][op:B]C[Hon: Surrounding a group is often the right thing to do, but it is also gote. White is clearly alive in the corner, so this looks a bit slow, especially since the left side is a bit cramped and not perfectly developable.

I think, I would rather play something like A or B.

It might be a matter of style though. I'm beginning to get this odd Takemiya feeling - something is growing steadily. :-)]
;W[qf];B[nd]C[Pincer didn't feel appropriate, here.

Hon: This move fits well to the keima on the left. But I think a pincer is also logical in this position, building the moyo on a greater scale.]

(;W[rd]
(;B[qc];W[op]LB[qi:a]C[I thought this was a W mistake, not playing at
A or nearby, so I pincered, especially since it was now W's big but open side.

Hon: Correct.];B[qh]C[Too close?

Hon: This is the textbook punishment.]
(;W[rc];B[rb];W[of];B[oh]LB[mf:a]C[Should I have capped at A?

Hon: A suits the keima to the left quite well. But you also push White's weak group towards your own weak stone, which we normally don't want to do.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[mf]
(;B[ql];W[kq];B[fl]LB[ld:A]C[Hon: This is no small move, but A looks more important to me.]
;W[ej]C[Hon: Overplay.];B[gj]C[Hon: Good.];W[fh];B[hh];W[hg]

(;B[gh]C[I didn.t hane right away because I didn't want to see a W stone at 45.]
;W[fg]LB[gg:a]C[I had expected W46 at A...];B[gg];W[ff]
(;B[fe];W[cg]C[Ooph1 -- unfinished business down there.]
(;B[dg];W[ch];B[dh];W[be]C[Hon: Like this, White can locally already feel relieved. He has lost quite a lot, but he has also been able to invade a place where he never should have been able to live, let alone take points. 

So Black hasn't accomplished as much as he would have liked to.]
;B[cd];W[bd];B[ld]C[Resuming the attack on W's group.];W[di]
;B[ci];W[gf];B[hf];W[he];B[if];W[dj];B[ck];W[ee];B[fd];W[gd]
;B[de];W[hd];B[fi]C[B survives, but lost the corner and some of the side.   I feel I should have had a better result, but I made some early mistake...

Hon: ... letting the corner stones connect to his side stone.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[pe]C[Now trying in earnest to destroy W's group;
but as it turned out, B's upper group wasn't strong enough for the fight.]
;W[pf];B[qe];W[re];B[rg];W[sb];B[qb];W[rf]
(;B[sf]C[Hon: This move is wrong. White can only make one eye in gote here. But the group as a whole is not yet surrounded properly!

The order in which you should attack is surround, limit, kill.]

(;W[mh];B[ng];W[nf];B[mg];W[lg];B[lf];W[og];B[nh];W[ph];B[pi]
;W[qg];B[ri];W[le];B[kf];W[md]
(;B[kd]C[Hon: This was an overplay. 

Normally you can not let your opponent cut through into your territory like this. Even if you live, the loss is too terrible. Because you first staked out territory there, spending your moves, then end up with no points there. Your former moves lose their meaning. In some cases, the outside influence might make up for the loss, but that is rather an exception than a rule.

In most cases, you can only play this kind of move, when you are 110% sure that it kills the group!]
;W[mc];B[nc];W[mb]C[Here I finally realized I had big problems
-- either he would connect to the left, or I would have to scramble to make two eyes.
I thought I could just barely make two eyes.

Hon: Still, this is the point where you have to decide if you live or if you try to kill. Count liberties now, not one move later!]

(;B[jb];W[ob]LB[nb:a]C[I had read out a sequence beginning with the response of B105 at A; but with the stones actually on the board I decided I had been hallucinating, and could not get more than one eye, if that.

Hon: Okay, the dreadful "reading mistake". No one is safe from that. 

But if one move earlier you don't see it really clearly, then better not risk it. (If you THINK you saw it clearly, then you are doomed, of course ... ^_^)]
;B[oc];W[nb]LB[ko:A][mq:a]C[So I can get one gote eye, but I lose the capturing race by a big margin.  Here I stopped recording.

 At this point I invaded at A, to stir up trouble.
And though I got a live group and had a good attack on another of his groups, in the end it did not suffice and I resigned.

Was a Black invasion at A reasonable, incidentally?

Thank you for your comments!

Hon: A is one normal point to invade. If it is good or not depends on the whole-board position. After your group died in the top right, an invasion of the bottom was probably do or die - go in there and hope that the opponent stumbles along the way.

Another way would probably be trying to go for the center with a move like A. You got a lot of territory potential there. But with the kill on the board it will probably not be enough.

Okay, that's all for now, I hope my comments have been helpful!

Best wishes,
Bernd])
(;B[ob]C[Hon: Living like this is easy. 

How does White connect, by the way? I don't see it.]))
(;B[mc]C[Hon: Must!]))
(;W[nh]C[Hon: White rather has to make sabaki like this. In the game he became too thin.]
))
(;B[ng];W[nf];B[kf];W[lg];B[li];W[mh];B[nj]LB[sf:A]C[Hon: I think, this sequencelooks promising. Even if White makes one eye somehow, he still has to play A for another one.]
))
(;B[bd]C[Hon: You have to disconnect him, threatening the corner. Now White must make eyes for two groups at once - great for you!

Keeping the enemy disconnected is crucial in fights.]))
(;B[gf]C[Hon: Just push through. Like this you get super-thick stones towards his other weak group, and you are just as well connected to the left (please confirm this).]
))
(;B[ig];W[gh];B[hi]C[Hon: Even if White plays the move you didn't want to see - I think it doesn't help him very much.]
))
(;B[ld]C[Hon: This looks like honte. You attack him, and the upper side is where you profit from that attack.

At first glance his group might look stronger, but your group has more space to move than his, and your influence to the left is in wait to check the white group, should it run there.]
)
(;B[mh]C[Hon: Or you go all-out directly to torment the stones to the maximum. This looks a bit harsh to me, but maybe it's also an option, if you are a player with a firm grip.]
))
(;W[of];B[oh];W[mf];B[ld]LB[mh:B][ql:A]C[Hon: I think like this you can find it in the joseki books.

White gave Black secure points in the corner and on the upper side, but still has not even a base. Playing S16 without adding an extension is really bad.

Your group is stronger than White's, because A and B work as a kind of miai for you, while your influence stones to the left stare daggers at White.]
;W[qk]C[Hon: This move looks desperate ...];B[mh]C[Hon: ... virtually suicidal.]
))
(;B[qh]C[Hon: You might consider this pincer, since you have built substantial influence on the upper and left sides.]
;W[qc];B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[rf];B[pj]C[Hon: And then go for this kind of large-scale moyo.

Personally I don't like to play like this, because White has all the safe points in the corners. But this way of play seems to suit G15.

It has become a Takemiya kind of game now.]))
(;W[pj]C[Hon: This move looks more normal to me. White starts to counter Black's influence by starting a Kobayashi-like structure on his own.]
))
(;B[tt];W[cg]C[Hon: Let's say, White gets a chance to move this stone later.]
;B[bd];W[dg];B[ef];W[eg];B[ff];W[gh];B[eb]C[Hon: Then you have for example this move. After your peep in the game, this option is gone.]
))
(;B[fd];W[gd];B[gc];W[cc];B[ec];W[cd]C[Hon: This would be one joseki. White gets the corner, you build thickness towards your hoshi stone and get sente too.

Since White is solid, you can argue now that C10 was wise after all, staying away from White's strong position. With a bit of fantasy you can sometimes find a move which saves the face of a former not so good one. 

Anyway, I think, this is okay.]))
(;B[em];W[bn];B[bm];W[dn];B[cm];W[fn];B[gm]LB[cf:B][df:D][cg:A]
[dg:C]C[Hon: It is also a joseki. You build a huge wall (in exchange for many points). I feel, that C10 ends up at a not so good spot. After the wall is finished, you would probably prefer the stone on one of the lettered points.

It's probably okay anyway.. After all there is large influence now for black in the upper part of the board.]
))
(;B[dn]C[Hon: This is the proper shape.]))
