C[Hi, Peter:

This was a good game for review, I think. I've addressed your questions, and pointed out a few other things that should help. I hope you find it useful.

Bob];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[The Chinese... heard of it but only a vague understanding of how best to respond

----------
Rev: In a nutshell, the Chinese fuseki sets up a relationship between the 1st 3 stones that gives Black ample chances to build a framework that extends in multiple directions.

There's not a whole lot that you need to "do" in response to it, other than take any chance you get to flatten the moyo back down (but that's no different than what you usually want to do, anyway).]
;W[jd];B[gq];W[dn];B[jp];W[nc];B[qf];W[cj]C[Reasonably happy with this position but note my holes at g16 and d13 areas]
;B[cf]C[which he invades :-(

Considered F16 as a standard response but with my stone at c10 thought i could try and squeeze at C15 and stop slide into corner at C17

-----
Rev: Nothing to feel bad about here. The reason you build up a framework is not to make an invasion impossible (then it would not be a framework, it would be territory.) The main reason is to give you the upper hand when the opponent finally does invade. You're making territory while they're just trying to stay alive.

So, actually, now you've got Black where you want him!]
(;W[ce]C[Review: This is a good response.];B[be]MA[df]C[Review: But this isn't the way for Black to respond. X is almost the only move.]
;W[bd]TR[df];B[de];W[cd]C[Felt that this was helping me by building a 4th rank wall]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[ch]C[Considered a number of options here,

a) Q18 to contest the corner
b) e10 to build a wall opposing  D4
c) f15 to cap his 15th stones
d) G15 to help plug my hole

but I chose B14 which i now think was weakest of my options. The idea was to undermine the B base]
;W[bf]TR[ej][fe]MA[pb]C[Review: Agreed - this was not the best move. It's gote, and losing the stone on the edge doesn't hurt Black very much since his group has plenty of access to the center.

As I mentioned before, the thing you want to do is to build up your own position at the same time as threatening Black's group, so he's too busy running to get much in return. To this end, I would recommend one of the triangles.

The corner move you mention at X is important at other times, but right now you should be pressing your advantage against his invading group.]
;B[bg]
(;W[ae];B[df];W[qo]TR[oo][po]C[I remembered that at some stage I needed to try and break up his stones. Whilst playing this I did not have any real follow up plan..possibly R3/R7, but really I wanted to run to centre, hopefully live, and hence reduce his space

----------
Here's the difficult thing about playing against the Chinese fuseki. The invasion in this corner is pretty cramped.

This invasion is doable, but difficult because it's so deep. Invading at one of the triangle points is easier.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[np];W[nn]TR[pl]C[considered R7 here, but I wanted to run and had thoughts of connecting to D6

----------
Review: A couple of things here:

D6 is far away to think about too much. When running in this situation you should probably just think about getting to an open area.

The knight's move jump is fast, but vulnerable to cutting (depends on a ladder). When Black has positions on both sides like this it's pretty dangerous.

Finally, when your group is weak and the opponent has strong stones around, consider attaching. Instead of R7, which doesn't really give you much, consider the triangle point.]
;B[ok];W[ln]C[My BIG worry  is that these strings have no eye space..so Life seems to be hanging by a thread, but the die was cast, and looking now I could consider M4 as a follow up

----------
Review: You're right that there's no choice. M4 isn't much of a weakness for Black - and especially when you're busy just getting out.]

(;B[lp];W[jn];B[ge]
(;W[gd]TR[gc]C[Not sure about this... never sure when to ATTACH

My alternative was G17, a 3rd line stone which i felt might protect my territory better

I also thought that my balance between 3rd line stones and 4th line stones might be too ' influence' orientated.

BUT, the march along the 16 line seemed good

----------
Review: Generally, attach when you're weak in the area and the opponent is strong. That gives you some leverage to work with.

In this case, you're strong in this area, and attaching just gives Black something to get leverage on. Triangle would have solidified you position.]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[fd];W[gc];B[id]C[I feared G17 here and so was thankful to see J16

----------
Review: Yes, you got a little lucky here.];W[fc];B[fe];W[ic]
C[and now i had a secure upper corner but he had a powerful inner wall]
;B[he];W[ei]C[so i felt that i needed to move out into centre and try and form a moyo based upon my c8 area

-----
Review: Good. And more importantly, you neutralize the power of Black's newly-built wall which, as you point out, was what he gained from the recent exchange at the top. So in effect he got very little while you got territory.

Again, though, watch that knight's-move link. I THINK it can barely survive a cut in this case, but it's hard to be sure. A simple single-jump out on your part would have done much the same thing and been safer.]
;B[eh];W[di];B[dh]
(;W[go]TR[fi]C[looking to build the lower part of my moyo and seeking a connection to K6, back to original plan

------
Review: Good. You may also have wanted to consider the triangle point. One more extension in this area would save you from the "squashing" effect that you see in the upcoming moves.]
;B[fi];W[fj];B[gi];W[gj]C[I noted that he was building territory around F13 but intended to reduce his space from O17 stone and overall i thought my potential space was larger]
;B[hj];W[hk];B[ij];W[ik]C[My space is being squashed.

I noted here lots of cutting points for both B & W, eg e10/ f12 / g9 etc

but i am never sure how to take advantage of these cuts

-----
Review: I definitely think you're getting the most out of this sequence.

The cutting points (on both sides) would be hard to capitalize on for now. These are the sorts of things that tend to just come back and bite you later in unpredictable ways.]
;B[jk];W[ne]C[so, as planned, move out into his area from another direction]

;B[il];W[hl];B[jm];W[hn];B[kn];W[km]C[i was concerned now about life prospects of O6 grp, so looked to use this atari to then truy and build some eye shape]
;B[in]TR[ko]C[SURPRISE!!

The next sequence shows a number of KOs and very unclear as to whether i played it in a good way

I chose L5 as worried about M7 cut

-----
Review: Surprise, indeed. There was no reason for Black to do this - he should have just connected his stone in atari (triangle), and settled for cutting your groups.

As it was, the next several captures didn't really change the situation any.]

(;W[ko];B[hm];W[gm];B[jo];W[im];B[kn];W[nl]C[looking to create eye space and prepared to sacrifice the odd stone around K6 area]
;B[jn];W[hm]TR[nk]C[POOR???

L8 better?

----------
Review: Yes, it looks like you connected by reflex here. But once Black connected, that one stone was unimportant. There are certainly more important things right now.

Rather than L8, though, I would go back to the idea of leaning against his surrounding groups to get yourself some space (say, at triangle). Again, saving those single stones is not important now.]

(;W[qm]TR[po][qo]C[I have been caught before by not protecting this cut, but i think it was not necessary in this position, tho i did not read that at the time

-----
Review: True, not necessary here (yet) because of your triangle stones. But it's good you're seeing this as common vulnerability.]
;B[ng]
(;W[lf]TR[ne]SQ[jd]C[looking to do something about my hole at M16. I am accused of not being aggressive enough and so conciously chose this ( as opposed to say M16/17 ). Thought connection with K16 now weaker but it does attack

-----
Review: OK, but be aggressive safely :-)

The key thing to notice here is that your move is only connected on one side (triangle). On the other side (square) it's not connected and this sort of opening can be a lot of trouble.

Even holding back one line at M15 would keep both sides secure.]
;B[jf]TR[ke]C[Review: Often, when you leave a gap like the triangle point, the opponent can jump right into it immediately. In this case, Black can't do that really, since you could leak into his central area.

But that does mean that this move of Black's is a big threat to go through the hole in your line.]
;W[lh]TR[ke]C[and now a potential link to O11

----------
Review: I think this move probably cost you more than any other. If you had sealed off the opening at triangle, you would have been ahead in the game by, say, 15 points, with no significant weaknesses to worry about.

After that, you could have played some large but safe moves to gain some territory in the corners, and extended your lead to maybe 25 points. As it was, once Black gets through the hole you fall way behind and only squeak out a narrow win in the end.

As for the link to O11, there's very little value in it. A link is only important when a weak group is needs to link up to make life. In this case, both ends of the potential link are already alive.]
;B[ke];W[kd];B[le];W[mf]
(;B[me];W[nf];B[nd];W[md];B[od];W[mi]TR[lh][lf]C[needed to ensure a connection between M14 and O11

-----
Review: Well, now, yes. A few moves back you probably should have considered sacrificing one or both triangle stones in favor of sealing off your larger top side area.]
;B[mc];W[ld];B[nb];W[lc];B[mb];W[jb]C[was wary of a potential cut at k17 and thought this would also protect H18 area

-----
Review: Not a danger now, but it is the sort of cutting point that can be dangerous when liberties get short.]
;B[jh];W[ki]TR[dq]C[Review: The 5 moves you make starting from here aren't helping you much.

Notice that after your next 5 moves you don't really have any new territory surrounded. Any 5 sente moves should get you a lot more than that.

One thing that's important about this point is sealing off your lower-left corner (such as at triangle).

Fortunately for you, Black responded each of the 5 times and it didn't really cost you anything. But you certainly can't count on this!]
;B[ji]C[Review: Black really didn't need to respond here...]
;W[kj];B[jj]C[Review: ... or here...

(as before, maintaining this link  is not important, as both ends are alive on their own.)]
;W[kg];B[jg]C[Review: ... or here...];W[kf]
(;B[je]C[Review: ... OK, maybe I'll give him this one and the next one.

But even here I'm not sure, since in each case he would only have lost 3 unimportant stones (that is, non-cutting stones.) He could have made a lot more elsewhere. For instance, by invading your corner (see variation).]
;W[kk];B[kl];W[pf]C[looking now to try and reduce another B space. Thought that I was still attacking

-----
Review: OK, now you're talking. This is a nice poke into Black's opening.]

(;B[of]C[Review: The wrong response from Black. He can't cut, so he should have just accepted a small loss and sealed off his openings (variation).

By playing this way he loses his advantage from the previous bit of play, and you end up ahead again.]
;W[oe];B[og];W[pe];B[qe];W[pg]C[Have been told that once i start pushing, then continue to push

-----
Review: Absolutely. This sort of "river" flowing into his territory from a secure base can be devastating. You can't make much territory yourself, but you sure can chew up a bunch of his. And you almost surely keep sente for a long time since you're threatening to cut off his group.]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[qh];W[rg];B[rh];W[rf];B[qd];W[re];B[rd]TR[qi]
C[I did not realize at the time but B R11 grp is DEAD :-(

When i used Score Estimator it showed this grp dead and i instantly saw that W correct move is T12

One of my major problems is that if I look at L&D problems I am getting better at solving them BUT , on the board I do not recognize that it IS a L&D shape :-(

But reviewing like this might improve my instinct skills :_)

-----
Review: Yes, this group is dead, but the key point for both sides is not T12 but R11 (triangle.)

If you play T12, Black takes the key point and lives. See variation on the next move for why this works.

If you take the key point, Black has no way to make 2 eyes here. Of course, saying it's "dead" requires that you know not only to play R11 but also to make the correct follow-up plays afterward, so keep studying those life-and-death problems :-)]

(;W[pp]C[switching focus

-----
Review: See variation for life-and-death status of Black's right-center group.]
;B[qq];W[eq]TR[cj][dn][dp]SQ[dq]C[Looking to secure LHS

-----
With the large open area you have in the corner (the shape of the triangle stones), a much better way to seal the corner is with square.]
;B[er];W[dr];B[fr]
(;W[fq]C[BAD MOVE>

I had recognized earler that the C3 invasion could be a concern and should have played that now but did not consider it once D2/D4 were present

-----
Well, yes, the 3-3 point is still pretty open, but that's been true for most of the game up until now.

Even without that factor, though, the main bad thing about this move is that it doesn't really gain you anything, and doesn't threaten Black in any significant way.]

(;W[dq]C[C4 may have been much better..I was wary of having D2 isolated but looking at variation I could have killed invaders]
;B[cr];W[ds]
(;B[cs]TR[bo]C[Review: This was unproductive by Black. He could have made this a lot worse by playing the other direction into your open side area (triangle). (see variation)

While you're trying to seal off your area Black would make (relatively) easy life here.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq]
(;W[ar]TR[br]C[considered also B2 which i think now was best

-----
Review: OK, but there's nothing saying Black will give you the chance.

Generally it would be better to just go ahead and play at triangle. Getting this on the 2nd line now rather than the first line later is usually worth more points.]
