Hi, I am kex, about 4k in KGS, reviewing for both sides.

White is clearly superior in skill, so there is not much to comment on white's mistakes, most are for black.  Life and death exercises would be beneficial, as there are numerous little groups on the board, and some of them get killed here.

Black loses due to the sequence around move 40; after that black fails in by the resulting life and death problems, sealing white victory.  White also makes some mistakes, but this time they are not decisive.]

(;B[qe]LB[jd:A]C[**
This move is probably OK, but I would not use it.  The corner enclosure faces the white stone, and would benefit from an extension around A, which white can easily prevent by playing there.]

(;B[jq]
(;W[jj];B[gq]LB[jc:A];W[jd];B[cn]LB[cc:A][qn:C][dr:B]C[**
I don't like this move.

The reason is that black does not have a lot of room for extending here, anyway.  The upper corner (A) reduces white area considerably, and pretty safely, and  black can also slide at B - white is not able to cut it away.  Black can also still create own moyo, for example around C.  "A" would be the most urgent of these here.]
;W[eo]
(;B[ck]C[**

do not extend this far.  White responds nicely, and black is in problems.]

Black trades sente for 2 or 3 points by pushing, while white got a big wall AND can use sente to play to N17.

Do not crawl on the side like this, unless you really can destroy opponent's area.  Here, white really had not much area on the side, so the gain for black was just a couple of points, while white got a lot of potential area (the triangles, or possibly even more)]

(;B[kg]LB[nc:D][nd:C][lh:A][mi:B]C[**
This is a serious mistake.

Because of the exchange A-B, black group cannot connect easily to the friendly stones on the right side or on the bottom, black needs to kill the cutting stones first.  White C or D ends the game]

this move has no purpose.  Black has no hope of surviving with this stone, so black just loses a ko threat.  Instead, A makes black alive]
