C[Hello--my name's Andrew, and I'll be your reviewer for today.  I play on KGS as Dudzik [12k\].]
;B[pd]C[General general comments, that is, comments which are general enough that I could make them to almost any player:

Improving your skill at the basic tactics of go, namely life and death and tesuji, will be a source of improvement for many, many ranks to come.  However, there is a lot of strategy to the game as well, and your enjoyment of the game will increase as your opening becomes more thoughtful.  So I'm going to try to talk about overall strategy a bit, although you have a few more stones before you need to worry about it too much.

Biggest piece of advice is: work problems!  Reading a bit of the Graded Go Problems for Beginners series, or Get Strong at Tesuji, or spending some time at goproblems.com, will help your game tremendously.  If you already do this: keep it up!  It will pay off very well in the long run.]
;W[dp]C[General specific comments, that is, general comments about your playing specifically:

You played a very solid game, with many excellent ideas.  But your let yourself get a little pushed around a couple of times.  It is important to not back down when your opponent is being very aggressive.]
;B[pq];W[cd];B[pk];W[ec]C[So far the opening looks very normal.]
;B[fq]TR[cj]C[I'm not strong enough to call this move bad, but playing at the triangled intersection looks better to me--the idea is to break up white's formation on the left.]
;W[cn]
(;B[kp]LB[kp:A]TR[jp]C[This move should probably be closer, for instance at K4.  White is now strong on the left, and you need a little more support for your F3 stone.  White was able to take advantage of this in the game--see the variations for what happens if white tries his same plan with this move at K4.]
;W[eq]
(;B[fp]LB[fp:A][iq:B]C[Since white can split up your stones so easily, this move shows a little too much attachment to the F3 stone.  It would be painful to allow white to play F4, but not as painful as what actually happened.]
;W[hp];B[gn];W[in];B[hq];W[dk];B[kn];W[il]C[After this, black can connect easily by playing at J3.]

(;B[nc]LB[nc:A][iq:B]C[This move is big, but not urgent.  J3 saves all of black's stones and puts a lot of pressure on white.]
;W[iq]C[mansairaku: I had not figured this move out, so at this time I choose to give up the stones F3-F4 and G6.

Probably a good idea, but much too late.  You only have ten stones on the board, so giving up four of them puts you far behind.  Also, if white captures these stones, white gets dozens of points of totally secure territory on the left, connects all of his stones, and gets tremendous power in the center.  So your gift was VERY generous. 

Black is weak here, but white's group is also weak, so you can play more aggressively.  See the variation.  It is also always an option to run out into the center, although such a strategy is risky here.]

(;B[jq]LB[ip:B][jq:A];W[ir];B[ip];W[gq]C[You can still save your stones!]

(;B[jr]LB[ho:B][jr:A];W[hr]C[Now there is little hope for your group on the left.  White has solidified a lot of territory.]
;B[jd];W[fr];B[gc]
(;W[cg]LB[cg:A][kk:B];B[kk]TR[gc][cg]C[This move is exactly the right idea, but in my opinion it was a huge risk to play G17 first.  White was kind and responded on the left side, but could have walked directly into your potential territory in the center.  The game would then be much more difficult for black.  Again, urgent points before big ones.  It is important to play in the critical areas while there is still a chance.]
;W[km];B[lm];W[jn];B[kl];W[jm];B[ko];W[io];B[ji]C[Very good!  The stone in atari is not important.]
;W[jp];B[kq];W[hi];B[ig];W[gg];B[pg]TR[qc][qn]C[This was good--the right side was open to invasion before this move, but now it is much more solid.  White might still try something at or around the triangled points.]
;W[he]
(;B[ie]LB[ie:A]TR[id]C[This move is too greedy.  Better to play at, for instance, J16, to strengthen the top.  White still cannot enter your center territory.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[hd];B[if]C[mansairaku: The stones on the upper side seem weak, so I choose to play J14 instead of H17 in order to protect my territory.

It does get a little ugly if white gets to play J14.  Your move at J15 is the reason you are in trouble here.]
;W[hc];B[ib];W[hf];B[hb];W[gd];B[fc];W[fd];B[fb];W[qc]C[In response to your later questions about this invasion: it is somewhat complicated to analyze these things in detail, but your upper right corner was definitely not completely secure.  White can get at least a ko for life. (shown in the variations)  With the way white played, it may have been possible to kill, though difficult.

However!  When you build such an enormous territory, you should expect some invasions.  The goal should not be to kill them, but to seal them in very tightly.  White gets only a tiny portion of your territory here, but you get a beautiful wall that helps secure the rest of it.]
;B[qd]
(;W[pc]LB[pc:A][rd:B]
(;B[rc]LB[rc:A]TR[oc]C[A move at P17 kills the white group, if I am not mistaken.]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[ob];B[oc];W[sb];B[qa]TR[oc][qd]C[mansairaku: I do not know if this move was the reason why white achieve life in this corner, but obviously I made a mistake somewhere, because it seems possible to prevent any attack there, or was my corner so weak ?

As a rule, if you play on the 4-4 point, you need at least two more moves to secure the corner.  Here, you only had one. (P17)  So you should not expect to kill this invasion.  But that's OK.]
;W[ra];B[nb];W[pb];B[oa];W[qb];B[na];W[pa]C[Here, white has 3 points in the corner. (2 + 1 prisoner)  And black has sente.  This is GREAT for black.  Don't worry so much that you didn't kill.]
;B[ij];W[hj];B[eb];W[db];B[dc];W[ed];B[cb];W[cc];B[da];W[dd]
;B[db];W[bb];B[ik];W[hk];B[ih]C[There were some other slow moves in here, but this one is certainly no threat at all to white.  Much better to secure the lower right corner.]
;W[po];B[qp];W[qo];B[pm];W[qm];B[ql];W[rl];B[rm];W[qn];B[rk]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[rn];B[sl];W[sn]C[White is in a lot of trouble here, with at most one eye.  If black plays a move like O4, it is unclear how white will get a second eye.]

(;B[sp]LB[np:B][sp:A]C[White needs two eyes to live, so there is no need to be in a hurry to take away just one.  This move is not the best idea.]
;W[pp];B[ro];W[oq];B[pr]C[mansairaku: I guess there should be a better move around O5, isn't it ?
At this time I had not fully understood my weaknesses in M6-M8

The corner group is probably in danger, so this move is a good idea.  White is still in a lot of trouble, but the cut at M6 is something that white can aim at.]
;W[np];B[on];W[or];B[mq];W[mo]C[This move is a peep at M6.  Connect!]

(;B[no]LB[ln:B][no:A];W[mp];B[nq]C[Moves like this are far, far too aggressive.  White does not have even ONE eye, so what is the purpose of this move?  Just play at N6 and seal white in for good.]
;W[ln]C[mansairaku: I thought at that time that white had already achieve life and won. Was there a way to prevent this from this point on ?

Black is totally cut off on the bottom, so has to live locally. (or perhaps make one eye in an attempt to kiil white)  That's difficult, but may still be possible, in part depending on the security of the black group in the lower right.

You should look at it this way: If white kills the bottom black group, the game is over.  So you'd better try to make it live, and resign if you fail.]
;B[mn];W[lo];B[lp]C[This is a good idea.];W[op]
(;B[mm]LB[mm:A][lr:B]C[What if you let white play the double atari?  Can he make two eyes?  See the variations.  I believe that this move lost you the game.

No more comments from this point on.  The game is over for black.]
