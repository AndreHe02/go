C[I'm W in this game I played on KGS against a 25k (I don't have a rating yet, but definitely in the high 20s).

Both sides in this game feel rather passive. I wasn't able to identify opportunities to aggressively attack B's weaknesses. I'm also looking for suggestions on big moves that I missed.

Hi firstian, this is MJ Clement, inimino on KGS, saltpepper on IGS, I'll do my best to point out any questionable moves and suggest alternatives.  Please make sure you check out all the variations, a few of them contain lengthy comments.  If you like you can load this game on KGS, and if you have further questions, I'll try to answer them for you.  I did review moves for both, but more for w since you sent in the request.]

(;W[mq]C[This move is not often seen.  See the variations for common alternatives.]

(;B[pk]C[an uncertain move.  This begs for a w invasion soon somewhere between R11 and R14.]

(;W[dq]C[W has already made three moves on the bottom side of the board.  I'm tempted to say that placing a fourth stone here is not the best idea.  See variations for some other possibilities.]

(;B[ec]C[probably not the best move in this position.  See variations.]

(;W[iq]TR[fp][gp][kp][fq][gq][kq][qq]C[Q: Would it be better to extend towards B's shimari (e.g. C11) than playing
 J3? What are the factors to consider?


---


Yes, it would be much better, see variations.  Here w has a solid claim on much of the bottom side, although b can still reduce or invade in marked points.  However, b has positions spread further, and covering more ground, so b is slightly ahead now.  Also, a move on this side would be better at K3 or G3, but better to not play again on this side at all.  Now w has 5 stones, all on one side, that is overconcentrated.  There are many often conflicting considerations in fuseki, and I don't like to prescribe cut-and-dried principles.  The best thing is to try different things and develop experience.  Eventually you will be able to read your opponent's options as well as your own, and then you will be able to consider the consequences of various fuseki moves.  The only way to choose the best move is to know what your opponent's best reply is, this is why fuseki is so difficult.  

However, an experiment for you in your next few games:
Don't ever put more than three stones on the same side until you have something on each side.

Please don't take this as a principle of go, but just as an experiment to try in your next few games, to help you avoid this particular kind of fuseki mistake seen here.]

(;B[jc]TR[cg][ck][cl]C[probably better placed on the left side.]
;W[ci]C[w stakes a bold claim to almost all of the left side.]

(;B[cg]C[No!  This is very passive.  This is a game-losing move.  By playing here, b protects a few points, but lets w make many more on the entire lower half of the left side.  See variation.]
;W[cl];B[pg]
(;W[eh]C[At this point, I'm not sure what to do. I considered P6, which I rejected because it encourages B to slide into the corner. I also considered 3-3 invasion at R17, but I didn't want B to have a solid wall shining in the corner. So E12 seems to be safest. What is the biggest move here instead of E12?


---

This is a difficult question.  This kind of fuseki is not often seen above 20k, with all stones of each color on the same half of the board.  You should think about invading earlier, so that you do not end up in this particular kind of quandary.  However, in this position, I think E12 is ok.  However, bigger would be to invade the top side immediately, to secure your own LR corner, or to make a moyo on a larger scale, see variations.]

(;B[mm];W[qc]C[Is a 3-3 invasion at this point a good idea? I never quite know the correct timing. In this case I was hoping that I can exploit one of the cutting points created by the 3-3 invasion, and link up with the W wall on 15-16 line, which I may be able to use later to separate B groups. I don't know if this line of reasoning is correct or not.


---


Yes, this is good timing.  The reason not to invade the corner is if the resulting wall will benefit b more than the small group benefits you.  In this case, b already has a very strong position, and R17 is your best chance to invade and live, so take it!  As far as cutting and connecting, that idea is not as reasonable.  Yes, you may be able to connect, but there is no need to do so.  Of course R17 will live, and the K16 group has plenty of room to live or connect to your other stones.  Connecting is something that is important if you have a floating group without eyes, or if you are trying to connect two weak groups.  In this case, you do not have weak groups and you should not worry about connecting.  Instead, you should be thinking about the largest unclaimed area of the board, the center.]

---

Taking the initiative is a good idea.  This move is not quite right however, b can just cut, see variations.  As for better moves, well, at this point it is the beginning of yose, and since there are only two groups for each color, there are just not many yose moves to be made.  The rule is play the biggest moves first, and play sente moves before gote.  In this case, B12 is a better move, and then S3 is quite big, easily the biggest point left.]

;W[fg]C[This exchange is bad, since I lost sente in the end.

---

Yes.   You must play some gote moves in yose, of course, but try to play the sente ones first, and end with the largest gote move.  In this case, S3 is very big.]

>From this final position, I can easily estimate the ranks of the players, even if I had not seen the game.  Ask yourself why this is.  Look at pro games, and the final positions of dan games, and try to find the differences in your own style of play that lead to these differences in final game position.

Good luck, and have fun with Go!  I hope this review is helpful.
