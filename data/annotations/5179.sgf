C[This was a no-komi game on KGS.

I have a few particular comments and questions from this game, but I'm interested in getting as much general criticism as possible.  What should I be thinking about during my games that I'm not already thinking about?

Thanks in advance for the review,
Andrew

IGK: HI Andrew, I review game on move per move basis.  If you see some comment some where but you did it later.  Just means that I thinking your timing was wrong.  I will look at the game from both view points, focusing on Black side. If you have any question feel free to mail me or catch on IGS or KGS.  All my comments will have "*:" front of them.]
;B[pe];W[dd]
(;B[dp]C[*: This move seems a bit odd, as you have a Q15 move which says you want white to play above so you can build a wall below.  So to use Q15 move to it's maximum power, playing Q4 is better idea.  As when you get a wall at Q15 area, D4 will be be complementing that wall.]
;W[qp]
(;B[fd]C[*: This move is better to play at P3, with the openning.  Letting white play P3, then will make R10 a key point for white.  And it wouldn't help you as much.  So better to cause trouble for white earily.]
;W[dg];B[jc]C[In retrospect, this seems too timid to me.  Perhaps D17 would have been better?

*: I don't recommend D17 as it closes of a later option of C17.  Better to play K17.  But the shape is a bit wierd with Q15.  So I did like to suggest L16 as a better shape move.]
;W[dn];B[fp];W[dk];B[ci]C[*: A bit too huried.
 
Order of moves are:
1. The urgent move (The move that gives you a base or takes away a base.)
2. The corners.
3. The approch move to corner, esp. 3,4.
4. The side.
   4.1 The side that a perfect corner is facing.
   4.2 The side that 3,4 stone is facing.
   4.3 The side with corner stone on the star point.

So by this guide like the MOST valuable move is P3.];W[ch];B[di]
;W[ck];B[fi];W[bi]
(;B[bj]MA[ci][di][ch][dg]C[It may not have been worth it at this point to try to aggressively separate white, but that seems to be what I did.

*: White has bad shape right now. So taking advantage of that is good idea.]
;W[bh]
(;B[bk]C[*: Doesn't accomplish much.  To kill an apponent you must have him surrounded first.  Which you don't white can easily run.  So it is better to just play B5 and attack from below so you DO MAKE WHITE RUN.

*: Another reason this is not a good move is, one stone is light, two is heavy.  When you play this now you have to defend it.

*: Light moves are easy to mover with and ignore.  If you lose one store it's only 2 points.  If you lose 2 it's 4 or more.  Trying to save every story can land you deeper in water then maybe just using it to give the enemy hard time.]
;W[bl];B[cj];W[co];B[cp];W[bp];B[bq];W[bo]
(;B[oq]C[*: Nice move.  Playing A3 would be too small right now.  But wrong direction, you should approch from the top and develop your top side.]
;W[op];B[np];W[oo];B[pq];W[qq]
(;B[no]C[*: I see the idea behind this move, but it helps white to play R11.  So better to hold a bit back now so you can go in later.]
;W[on];B[jq];W[qi]
(;B[qg]C[*: Wrong idea, you want to defend a corner that is THAT open?  Why?  Better to do something else with that move.]
;W[oj]C[*: White mistake, he should just play P11.];B[mm]C[*: Very nice move, but top is more important right now then the center.]
;W[hp]C[*: Bad timing, white has a weak group in the area, white can't afford to do this.]

(;B[hq]C[*: Not a good attack.];W[gp];B[gq];W[fo];B[eo];W[fq]
;B[ep];W[fn]C[*: Lets take a quick count ...

Black: ~ 30 Points on Bottom.

White: ~ 26 points on Right and ~ 20 points on left.

So you are behind.  The top is not space yet.  You invested a move at R13, so might as well make top yours.]

(;B[hn]C[This move seems irrational to me now, especially given that I could have cut at G5.

*: It's a good move, just wrong timing.  If you want to attack white, white not start with E6?]
;W[go];B[ip];W[nn];B[mn];W[og]

(;B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[oa];B[na];W[pb]
(;B[rc]C[This move was too bloodthirsty, I think.  I was having a bad day and wanted to kill something...

*: Correct, a guideline here is look at your own groups.  Are they safe?  If not you can't kill any one.]

(;B[qk]C[Thanks to the wall white's given me, I'm pretty confident that this invasion can live.

*: Nice idea, it's good to see you know that this is a weakness. But might be too late to play there directly.  So better idea is to develop attack to that point so you can take advantage of it.]

(;W[ql]C[*: White mistake.  NEVER attack when attacking.];B[pk]
;W[ok];B[rk];W[pl];B[rm]C[Pushing over here was probably wrong--white should have tried to seal me in from the other side right away, but lost her chance.

*: I agree, first defend then attack.];W[rl];B[sl];W[qn];B[ri]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[pj]C[*: too small.]
(;B[nf]C[*: wrong connection.  Should be N14.]
(;W[rn]C[*: White mistake.  This is not a serious mistake, but more for looking into end game.  Better to start at S10.  As it reduces the space black gets.]
;B[rj];W[sn];B[sm];W[qm];B[sk]C[*: Now he got 3 points .. so you are worse off 2 points.]

(;W[ff]C[*: Right idea but not good enough for white.];B[dc]
;W[cc];B[ec];W[ed]C[*: Thank-you move.  White should play C18 to reduce black.]
;B[fe];W[ee]C[*: Bad shape.];B[je];W[he]
(;B[hd]C[*: NO .. too defensive.  White has bad shape attack it.]
;W[ge];B[gd];W[gf];B[hi];W[db]C[*: Advince, if you don't take chance to attack your opponent when they have bad shape it will come back to bite you.  Now b/c you didn't attack his shape.  His ahead in the corner.]

;W[mi];B[nk];W[nj];B[lh]C[*: Bad shape and thankyou move.  Better to play L12 as it gives you better shape and connects your groups.]

;W[an];B[dj];W[ak];B[al]C[*: NOt good enough.  You give up one stone to take away one point.  So it's same Just play A10.  Now if whtie defends it's sente if not you can maybe alter capture it so it's one point in you favor.]

C[Despite my generous gift of the lower left corner, I squeak by.

*: You made very nice moves.  White fell behind at the top and side mistake.  He had chance to take that entire side :(.  And he didn't come into center quickly enough.  You were ahead most of the game, just few hike-ups here and there.

Lessons to be learned from game:
1) Don't attack directly, it leads to more bad ends then good.  Better to find an indirect way to attack.
2) Don't attach when attacking, attaching is for defending.
3) When defending, defend activily not passively.  For example H4 move, look at the example.  You defense was passive, it only defended nothing else.  Instead if you attack two groups at onces, the game gets new meaning.
4) Always defend before attacking.
5) The purpose of attacking is to gain, either to gain space or to gain power.  Killing is the last resort.
6) If you try to kill something more often then not, you will fail and then you will lose the game.
