C[Struggling with opening sequence. Not to sure about how to gain influence and how to defend territory properly. Please point out any big mistakes. Thank you for the review!

B: my comments will start with B.
B: reviewing for both sides, with empasis on the opening.];B[dd]
C[B: no comment here, although I usually see the opening around Q16. On the real board that's polite.]
;W[pq]C[B: this leaves black to choose which side he prefers.]
;B[pd]C[B: this, or R16 would also be my answer to Q3. It is a small difference, but white R4 would be a bit better in this situation and black would have a nice framework if you both play the variation (see variation after the next move).]
;W[dp]
(;B[jd]C[B: black goes for 1 side]
(;W[jq]C[B: I think this is a little bit too low. You have 2 stones on the 3rd line, and black has all his stones on the 4th line, and he has sente.]
(;B[cn];W[gp]C[B: here you are lucky, black approaches you on the left, so you can play the move you would have liked to play, even if black didnt approach. So for black: this is probably not the best approach. See variation for move 7.]
;B[dj];W[pk]TR[qn][oo][np]C[Is this okay shape?

B: normally I would say it's a bit weak, because black can invade or reduce on one of the marked spots. But because black is developing at such a high speed, I think it's ok to play big moves.]
(;B[jj]CR[cc][gc][qc][cf][cg][qg][qh][bp]C[I am not sure about this kind of move, is this a bad move?

B: not a bad move, but it is a move on influence. All stones on the star points are for influence. A play on one of the marked spots (many more are possible) tries to turn the influence into territory.]
;W[qf]C[B: this is a common approach in handicap games.]
(;B[md]C[B: this is not bad, but it leaves the corner open for attack, and there are some tricks around P17 (which I dont know myself). See variation.]
(;W[ph];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[rf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of]
(;W[gc]C[B: it's a good idea to invade. I'd prefer to play the same move on the other side (C13), because it's closer to my friendly stones, and there is a weak spot at C8.]
(;B[gd]C[B: attaching to a stone is usually not a good idea.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[fd];B[ed];W[hd];B[ge];W[fc];B[ec];W[eb];B[db]
;W[fa]C[Should black come in at J18?

B: yes, that's possible. But it can turn into a ko fight.]
(;B[cc];W[hb];B[nq]C[Is white moving at M3 a good move or should white play Q5?
What are you suggestions?]
(;W[lq]C[B: this is too close and black can run into the center, or leave this stone and play R5, as he did in the game.]

;B[lk]
(;W[mm]TR[fc][gc][fd][hd]C[where should white focus be? the weak group up top? is this a bad move?

B: it's hard to kill the white group, so it's safe for now. 
And there a no weak black groups to attack, so it's best to play a big move, or attack/reduce black. For me, the focus would be the left side. See variations. It's quite hard for white if black plays solid, but white is behind so has to do something.]

(;W[oi];B[oj];W[oh];B[pj];W[nj]LB[pj:A]C[Right here, what should black play to distroy this white group?

A play at one of the marked spots would make group C safer, and attack white at the same time.]
;W[kl]C[B: I find it hard to see the idea behind this move...]
;B[il]C[B: ...was it to cut off black? It might work, see variations. (hard to work out, I might have overlooked some move).]
(;W[in]C[B: this is a classic, which your opponent will point out to you in the next move.]
;B[jm]C[B: black will have no trouble to get through.];W[ko]
C[B: good respons to defend the best part or your territory.]
;B[km];W[ln];B[ll];W[nn]CR[cg][bp]C[B: you can always threaten to cut later, if there's a ko. And an invasion or a defensive move on the left is more urgent.]
;B[on];W[oo]C[B: ad even if you cut, black can still live in the corner and he has your other cutting stone (L8).]

[qs][rs][ss]C[B: territory versus influence is one of the hardest concepts in Go. Black was ahead in influence, but lost on territory points in the end.
A lot of books are written about the subject, and I myself have only read 2 so far.

Some easy things I try to remember:
- there are more points in the corner than on the side
- there are more points on the side than in the center

There were some points in the game where black could have closed the left side. That would gain more points than the center.
And in the opening, black could have made it more difficult for white.]
