AB[pd][dp]C[H: Hello, I'm Hannes and will review for black's side.]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[nc];B[qh]LB[pd:B][qf:A][qg:C]C[H: That's probably too far an extension. If white plays A, B is under heavy attack.

I'd suggest A, but C is also possible.];W[mq];B[jc]LB[lc:B]
[nc:A][ce:C][cj:E][cn:D]C[H: If black want's to attack white A, playing B would be better, as it immediately pincers A.

In case you don't want to attack immediately, the left side is open to extensions (C,D) and large-scale moves (around E)]
;W[kc];B[ck]LB[jc:B][kc:A][nc:C][jd:D]C[H: The contact move at A should not be ignored as it both attacks black B and tries to strenghen/settle white C.

Playing D would reinforce blacks stones immediately];W[ic];B[jd]
;W[jb];B[pc];W[oc]
(;B[cf]LB[jb:D][ic:C][kc:E][ce:A][cf:B]C[H: Playing A would secure the upper left corner. B is a more fragile extension. But there's nothing perticularly wrong about it, I think.

Another strategy would have been: use whites weakness in the C,D,E-"Group" to build a solid wall facing the center (see variation).]
;W[cd];B[dd]LB[cc:C][dc:A][cd:D][dd:B]C[H: I doubt that black can capture the white intruder (see variation). And the black wall (A,B) is not securing any territory.

Defending at C would have secured the corner with D becoming a very weak stone.
(So black can build territory by attacking the fleeing white stone)]

(;W[ec];B[de]LB[cd:A]C[H: good move. As white gives up A, black takes it. Big corner!]
;W[ed];B[hq]LB[db:A][hq:B]C[H: Black could have played A first. This will make points in the corner and white must respond. So black keeps sente (for e.g. playing B next)]
;W[cq]
(;B[dq]LB[cf:E][ck:F][cp:D][dp:A][cq:B][dq:C]C[H: If a 4-4 (A) is attacked by the 3-3 (B), the defender can decide, whether he wants the resulting wall be in horizontal or vertical direction. (see variation)

Although I don't think, playing C is wrong, I would have chosen D (horizontal wall), which fits nicely with E and F building a big black moyo on the left.]
;W[ee];B[cp]C[H: Good move.];W[id]
(;B[je]LB[kd:A]C[H: Playing A would have been another possibility (see variation)]
;W[kd];B[jg];W[pb];B[qb];W[pa];B[qa];W[ob];B[qc];W[od];B[pf]
C[H: Good sequence by black];W[pe];B[qe];W[oe];B[lg]LB[ke:A]
[ef:E][ek:B][qk:D][kq:C]C[H: I'm not sure what black tries to accomplish, here. So I guess it's a lost move.

Alternatives are:

1) Playing A to strengthen the black group and to aim at cutting white off the center

2) Building potential territory: B, C, D

3) Playing E to cut off white while building potential territory]

[di][ei][fi][gi][hi][bj][cj][dj][ej][fj][gj][hj]C[How could I have played this sequence more strongly?

H: This depends on what your aim is. If you want to keep the corner (capture white), reducing white's eye space is most important (see variation starting at A.

Playing B could help getting the marked territory];W[cc];B[cb]
LB[db:A]C[H: Mistake. White A would capture the black stone (see variation)]

(;W[eb]C[H: but white does not see this, black is lucky];B[db]
;W[bf]LB[cg:A]C[D13 then A17?

H: D13 does not help as white connects underneath (see variation)

White's alive, I think (see variation)]
(;B[bc];W[cg];B[df];W[be]
(;B[gf]LB[ck:A]C[H: Black should run in the direction of A (see variation), building potential territory]
