C[P: Hi deterius, my name is Peter. I'm about 1-2k.

To me, the big theme in this game is staying connected and using thickness. In several places, you give up some territory in order to get an outside wall, but you struggle to make good use of it. Remember, use thickness to attack! Black ends up using the walls to make a little territory in the centre, not to put pressure on white.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qq];W[dd];B[dj];W[dg];B[cn];W[gq];B[bp]C[P: Looks good so far. The choice to go into the corner might be too soon though. You don't need to worry about wc5, because after bd6, white has helped black fix the shape -- no more cut point at c8 for b! 

By sliding into the corner at b4, it encourages w to expand along the bottom, so maybe it's better for b to wait to see whether the corner or the bottom is more important]
;W[kq];B[eo]C[P: This move is aji keshi, meaning it helps w fix their shape and takes away a black tesuji at f3 later. It also doesn't help fix the cut point at c8... hard to see what good E5 does for b, but w gets e4 which is quite a nice point]
;W[ep];B[fo]C[P: Very gote and heavy. Gote because w has no reason to respond -- no local threat. Heavy because e5 is no longer a versatile stone full of potential that could be sacrificed if the need be. 

This corner is interesting, because black takes thickness while giving w territory and never manages to use the thickness. In the end, these stones are all used to create barely ten points in the middle of the board, after nearly getting cut apart. Going through the game, I'll have a few comments about them, but the basic theme is that they become heavy and have no use. Black e5 and f5 are the start of this story -- unnecessary forcing moves that take away cutting moves that would give you something to atack later]
;W[nq]C[w makes another big move on the bottom];B[po];W[nc]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[P: this joseki isok, but it's a bit better for w... the stones on line d in the upper right work well with l17 to make a moyo, while r14 doesn't do the same for b. I would have been inclined to try a pincer joseki and push w into the corner]
;B[pi]C[P: Too slow. This point is not very big and the right side is still open for invasion. consider an invasdion at d17 instead.

As well, like bb4 in the lower left, it's too soon to decide if the corner (a move at r18) or the right side (around q11)... better to invade the top or the upper left, start a fight, and then see which direction is best. I'd also have my eye on a cut around j3 (though the cut doesn't work without support) -- chasing the l3-03 stones could be a good way to close up the right side if that's what you want]
;W[ci]C[P: good idea, seeking to weaken b's stones, but this move is awkward... it's almost certain to be gote for w]
;B[di];W[ch]C[P: yeah, gote for w. I might have been inclined to just descend at c10 as black, to make a base for those stones before invading at the top. THe thickness of d11 is neutralized by wd13]

(;B[fd]C[P: Right idea, invading the w moyo on the upper left, but i think this is the wrong point. See variations. There are quite a few ways of following from the d17 contact move I suggest; the last variation is probably good play fo rboth sides]
;W[dc]C[P: This is the right move for w. This defensive move also effectively attacks the b stone. B will now have to run into the centre]
;B[ic];W[ke];B[ie]TR[ic][fd]C[Deterius [6k\]: Not that bad up until now I think?
Deterius [6k\]: That Group is may be a bit week

P: You made good shape, but w is strong on both sides, so all b can really hope is to live without getting in to too much trouble. If b can also get r18, then there are some ways to put pressure on w, around n18 or m16]
;W[bl]C[P: Good timing by white... force black to deal with a second weak group. I would have played this one line higher, at c8, to split the black group in two. This move is too soft and b responds well]
;B[cj];W[bj];B[cl];W[bm];B[cm];W[do];B[dn]C[Deterius [6k\]: Suddenly the Bgroup locks very smal

P: Yes, b's position has collapsed in that corner. be7 would have been a bit better than d6, since the peep around that point is hard for b to manage.]
;W[ql]C[Deterius [6k\]: Invasion of cause
Deterius [6k\]: But how to handle thet in the best way?

P: Too soon for w. Urgent points before big points, and dealing with the weak groups on the left is urgent]

(;B[om]C[Deterius [6k\]: the upper group is stronger so I try to puh W up

P: this move is a bit directionless... w can live comfortable underneath and the w stones on the bottom aren't under attack. See variation]
;W[rj];B[ri]C[P: this sequence is small and gote for b. Black already committed to letting w live with p7, so trying to secure the territory around r12 in gote is not worth much. Better to continue sealing w in]
;W[qj];B[qi];W[qn]C[P: Wrong direction w. The jump at p9 is urgent]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[ok];W[rp];B[qp];W[ro];B[rq];W[sq]TR[iq]C[Deterius [6k\]: W allive but as smal as I could mange
Deterius [6k\]: Here I thought about that Invation
Deterius [6k\]: Is it possible or resonable?

P: this w move is a gift to black, otherwise w lives in gote. B has a thick wall, so you're right to think about the cut. The wall on the right also helps the stones around d6]

(;B[fp]C[P: This is also aji keshi, meaning it makes w stronger and gives you nothing in exchange. it's generally best to simply not play these sorts of forcing moves.]
;W[fq];B[iq]C[Deterius [6k\]: That I did not expect]
(;W[cq]C[P: weird move. white could connect. see variation]
;B[ir];W[bq]
(;B[jp]C[Deterius [6k\]: I gus it is the wrong way

P: no, this is a good move -- push w towards the wall];W[kp]
C[P: You now have a choice between letting w live on the bottom and sealin in, or cutting away the base and letting w run. Since you are thick on the left and right, it might be good to force w to run. See variation on the next move for stealing the base]

(;B[jn];W[pr];B[mp]C[P: Again, why make an exchange that gives you nothing and strengthens white?]
;W[mq]C[Deterius [6k\]: agaain I try to keep W smal]
(;B[sr]C[Deterius [6k\]: I guse Ithough I could kill it

P: Do you mean the right? Both w groups are almost certainly alive. This is a turning point in the game. This b move is unfortunately a wasted stone, it does nothing. W takes sente to escape into the centre, splitting black's position. So w got the best of both worlds -- w made eye shape in the corner qith q2 and took b's base and escaped to the middle. Meanwhile, b's once thick position around q5 is becoming thin... Watch out for cut points at p5 and p11...]
;W[lo];B[no]C[P: Saving the n4 stone also has no purpose. The important thing here is to either confine white or to keep white weak. W ending up strong and in the centre is the worst outcome]
;W[lm];B[jl]C[P: These moves highlight the way the lower left corner was bad for b... B is now using the thick wall there to make a small amount of territory. The area between bk8 and bc8 is only about 20 points and took 14 stones to create. Compare that to b's upper right territory. If b plays r18, the area there will also be about 20 points, but will only have needed 7 stones. Or white's upper left corner: 25 points with 5 stones. Thickness must be used to attack, and the purpose of attacking is to take territory elsewhere.]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[fh]C[P: W plays to keep the bj15 stones separated]
;B[kf];W[me]C[P: light play, making eyeshape];B[ce];W[de];B[cc]
;W[cd];B[bc];W[bd];B[db];W[eb];B[da];W[fc]C[Deterius [6k\]: I gues the corner was too expansive

P: This was a terrible exhange for b. Living in gote in the corner is worth about 15 points, but it totally destroys the eyeshape of your j17 stones and gives w sente to attack them. Most of these stones die and it's in large part because of the exchange in the corner.

Sometimes, it's easy to panic when we see our opponent sealing up a big territory like the upper left and to dive right in to invade. but remember -- urgent points before big points! On every turn ask yourself, in order
1) do I have a weak group? If so, defend it!
2) Does my opponent have a weak group? If so, attack in such a way that it strengthens you as it runs
3) Neither of the above? Take the biggest point, preferring sente sequences]
;B[bb];W[gd]C[P: This is a gift from w -- this move is not important. w needed a move around n13]
;B[ge];W[hd]C[P: This exchange is very bad for b. The bf16 stone was sacrificed during the corner sequence -- w already spent two stones surrounding it, it has no value for b. The important stones are j17, j15 and k14,15 because w's territory is too big if they die. But here, b sacrifices the most important stone, j17, to save the least important, f16]
;B[he];W[id];B[jd];W[fe]C[P: fortunately, w also thinks f16 is important and spends a third move on it. w should just cut at k17 immediately and let b's position collapse]
;B[je];W[jc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[md];B[hg];W[hh];B[ih];W[ii]
;B[jh];W[gi];B[gg]C[Deterius [6k\]: during the Game I thought it was a good deal
Deterius [6k\]: Now Iam not shure anymore

P:You live comfortably, which is nice, but unfortunately it's quite a bad trade for b. The stones w adds around g11 also prepare for a reduction of b's moyo below and w took 25 points of immediate profit above. Making 5 points in the corner and five more in the centre isn't much compensation...]
;W[eh];B[lk]C[P: Good move! This forces w to defend on the bottom edge and strengthens a moyo above.]
;W[lp]
(;B[lr]C[Deterius [6k\]: W is alive already I gues

P: see variation];W[kr];B[mr];W[nr];B[qb]C[P: a big point];W[pc]
;B[hj];W[hi];B[gk]C[P: Good point. But it's important to remember the proverb "a stone played as a peep is light" -- this means that h10 should be considered light and sacrificed without regret This also came up around bn10 -- that peep stone was defended at great cost for little gain.]
;W[fj];B[fk];W[hp]C[Deterius [6k\]: W is reducing];B[io]C[P: this move is bad shape and will give you problems later. Better to play at h6, since the wall will end up there anyway]
;W[ho];B[hn];W[kl];B[kk];W[jm];B[kn];W[km];B[ln];W[mo]
(;B[mn]C[Deterius [6k\]: Here again I thought it is the better deal
P: yes, w overplayed, and b finally gets to sacrifice the n4 stone ^^]

(;B[rk]C[Deterius [6k\]: just a try
P: yeah, it can't be killed. the best play is to get t10 and t4 in sente and force w to live. (The variation on this move is nothing, I was just messing around and my client can't delete it)]

;W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[qd];W[oe];B[pf]C[P: It's a good moment in the game to slow down and ask what the biggest points are. This move is worth one point in double gote, very very small and not at all urgent.

Capturing at t4 is big and double sente. the monkey jump to f4 is worth ten points, absolutely huge at this point in the game. Connecting the bb4 stone, pushing at f14...

W has a big lead and there's no way for b to catch up, but it's still good to make sure you're taking big points in the endgame -- it's not unusual for games that are within ten points to be decided in the endgame.]

P: yeah, that's pretty painful. The sequences you propse are definitely better. But the problem with this shape goes back to bj5 at move 121... it was bad shape from the start, alas]
