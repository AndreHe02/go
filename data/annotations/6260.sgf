C[Bluebottle [11k\]: hi there
Pheidole [12k\]: hi!

samtregar: Hello and thank you for allowing me to review your game. I play at 4-kyu on KGS, so hopefully I can give you some useful pointers.  I'm by no means an expert though, so please feel free to ask further questions or look for comments from a dan-level player.  I'll prefix my comments with "s:".]
;B[pp]C[Bluebottle [11k\]: enjoy the game];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[dj];W[jp];B[pj];W[cl]LB[nc:A][jd:B][nq:C]C[s: I don't like this move at all.  So far all your moves (and black's moves) have been on the 4th line, emphasizing influence.  This move seems to be trying to attack black's lone stone on the left, but it's not very threatening - black still has lots of options.  It's too far from your corner to really secure any territory.  I'd prefer a move around A, B or C.

Janice Kim has an expression - "rush to plant your flag".  That means you should look for the biggest space without any stones and play there first during the opening.  I think that would argue for a play around B since it's definitely the largest open space.  (If you're ever looking for Go books, I think Janice Kim's 5-book series is really excellent!)]
;B[fc];W[cf]LB[df:A]C[s: I would prefer A here, which serves a similar purpose but gives you more options later.  Later black builds a nice wall here which is partially a result of this play.]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[ed]C[Pheidole [12k\]: thanks];W[de];B[df]LB[ee:A]
C[s: very odd move - I'm not sure what black is trying to do here.  I'd answer with A, splitting black's stones.  Splitting apart your opponent's stones is almost always good - one way or another it will work to your advantage!]
;W[dg]LB[ee:B][ef:A]C[s: Not good at all - this is a "thank you" move because it asks black to fix his shape by playing A.]
;B[ef];W[ci]LB[kc:B][nc:A][qf:D][jj:F][qn:E][nq:C]TR[ag][bg]
[cg][ah][bh][ch]C[s: Way, way too small.  This looks like it might be worth 6 points of territory.  It's still the opening, so moves like this are not worthwhile.  I'd prefer a move around A, B, C, D or E.  F looks interesting too in a "rush to plant your flag kind of way".]
;B[ee]C[Move 19: What was the right move here for white? Could this situation have been avoided by better play earlier?

s: I don't think white is in terrible trouble here.];W[db]TR[aa]
[ba][ca][ab][bb][cb][ac][bc]C[s: This looks small too.  It's not much of a threat - black is right to ignore it.  It might be worth 8-10 points, which is terrible for the opening.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[cg];W[bf];B[dh];W[di]LB[bg:A]C[s: I don't understand this move.  I think A makes more sense and keeps your stones connected.  Keeping your stones connected is of primary importance.]
;B[eg];W[ei]C[s: This move seems a little slow for so early in the game, but it does cut off the black stone and starts to make a nice wall facing your corner formation.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[bm];B[dr];W[er]
;B[br];W[fq];B[fi]C[s: Nice move - it puts preasure on your stones and expands black's wall.  It's an example of playing on the border-line between two large areas.  That's a good place to look for moves since you can expand your area while pushing the enemy back.]

(;W[ej]LB[fj:A]C[s: A little slow, I think A works beter.];B[hl]
LB[kc:B][nc:A]C[At this point, what am I looking to do? Am I trying to secure territroy in the bottom left? Make some at the top? Or weaken B on the right? And what is the best way to go about this?

s:  I think it's fairly obvious that black will win if you both secure the areas you've played in so far.  You need to invade in the upper right, which shouldn't be too hard since black's stones are mostly high.  I think moves around A or B are good.  You want to avoid playing too close to black's wall - "play away from power".  For that reason I think I would play A.]
;W[nc]C[s: Good move - I wish it had come earlier!];B[oc];W[nd]
;B[lc]LB[qc:B][nf:C][pf:A]C[What is the correct response to this move? It seems unusual.

s: It's a bit odd, A would be more common. I think I would jump into the corner at B.  You could also run out at C.  The move you chose worked out well too, although I think black may have had some better replies available.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[lb];W[jb];B[ic];W[mb];B[md]
;W[le];B[ke];W[me];B[qq];W[mp]LB[qe:B][mq:A]C[s: I don't like this - it's small and doesn't have any obvious purpose.  If you're trying to enclose territory it should be on the 3rd line like A.  I think I'd prefer a move around B - black's corner is weak and your group nearby is strong and alive already.  Black made a mistake abandoning the corner - punish him!]
;B[qc];W[oe]C[s: Absolutely useless move.  Black should completely ignore this and keep grabbing territory!]
;B[gj];W[kf]C[s: I like this move - it puts preasure on black and reduces his center territory.]
;B[jf];W[kg];B[oh]LB[lf:A][mg:C][mh:B]C[s: At this point a big alarm bell should go off around A!  Black is setting you up for a cut - the stone he played is staring right at it.  I think a play at B is a good defense, but C would be more conservative.]
;W[pe]LB[qf:A]C[s: seem small.  I think A would be better in this direction.]
;B[qe];W[pg]LB[qm:A]C[s: I like that this move keeps black's groups separated.  You might consider a placement around A after this.]
;B[qh];W[ph];B[pi];W[oi]LB[qg:A][qm:B]C[Was this a good move? My plan was isolation/capture of P12, which didn't really work.

s: Planning to isolate and capture a single stone is planning too small!  Even if you succeeded black would probably get more in the process.  I think A is a better move locally to keep the groups apart, although something around B seems bigger overall.]
;B[nh];W[ni]C[s: I don't like this - it practically begs black to hit your two stones on the head, and he obliges.]
;B[mi];W[ok];B[mh];W[om]LB[qm:A]TR[ni][oi][ok]C[s: This looks like another "thank-you" move to me.  Black wants to turn that area on the right side into territory and now you've given him the perfect opportunity.  If the marked stones weren't there you'd want to play deeper - at A for example.  The problem now is that would set you up for a splitting attack.  You've made a weak group when you tried to attack black.]
;B[qm];W[ql]C[s: Nice move.];B[rl];W[qk];B[qg];W[qf];B[rf];W[pf]
;B[re];W[qi];B[kj];W[jg];B[if];W[ig];B[hf];W[fl]LB[gk:A][jk:B]
TR[ek][dl][el][dm][em][dn][en][do][eo]C[s: This feels really slow.  It's worth maybe 9 points of territory, and some of that isn't really secure.  I think if you want to play on this line you should be pushing more.  Maybe A or B.]
;B[lf]LB[lg:A]C[Did M14 spell doom for the cutoff group? (If so, then merely recognising the danger of this move and preventing it with,l say, M13 is enough. If not, how could I have saved it?

s: Looks dead to me.  I think you needed to protect this cut earlier.  Once you see something like this leave it alone.  Playing A now just makes your stones weaker and doesn't help you.  Maybe later you can come back and save this group, in a ko fight for example.]
;W[lg];B[mf];W[ne];B[mg];W[gi]LB[ij:A]C[s: This move doesn't make sense to me.  It only seems to help black get stronger here.  If you want to try to make complications and possibly escape I think the move is around A.  If black isn't careful you might turn the tables and capture his group.]
;B[hi];W[gh];B[fh];W[hh];B[ii];W[li]C[s: Another move that helps black get stronger.  Desperation is no good in Go - if you can't see how a move will help you, don't play it!]
;B[lj];W[ji];B[jj];W[hj];B[hk];W[gn];B[ij]C[s: wasted move...]
;W[oo];B[nq];W[op];B[oq];W[mq];B[km]LB[ln:B][np:A]C[s: Another alarming move - this stones is staring at the cut at A.  I would play a defensive move around B I think.]
;W[in];B[qj];W[ri];B[rk];W[rj];B[po];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm];B[nj]
;W[oj];B[ml];W[nk]C[s: This kind of move is something you should learn to avoid - it just asks black to get stronger.  Even if it is a forcing move you should save it in case you need it in a ko fight.  Just playing it like this only wastes the potential without giving you anything in return.  I think the Japanese term is "aji-keshi".]
;B[mj];W[kn]LB[bg:B][mr:A]C[By this stage, I was thinking that my only option was to secure a very large portion of the bottom. Am I going about it adequately? Is connecting at L6 wise or is it too ambitious? I'm told that connecting to weak stones makes them stronger...

s: I think this move is ok, but it's not very large.  I think A and B are bigger.]
;B[ln];W[lo]LB[ko:A]C[s: this move looks suspect to me.  Why not just decend at A?]
;B[no];W[mn]C[I see that this was not wise, K6 would have been better.

s: I think I'd play O4 here to keep my stones connected.];B[np]
;W[on];B[lm];W[jn];B[mo];W[mr];B[nn];W[il];B[im];W[jm];B[hm]
LB[il:A]C[At what point in the game would H7 be the best move? We did a lot of other stuff and I never got the chance to make it, which cost me dearly.

s: H6 is the best move - your one stone a A isn't worth protecting at the expense of your moyo.]
;W[kl];B[mk];W[ll]C[s: more "aji-keshi."];B[mm];W[rg]LB[bg:D]
[an:C][ds:B][ps:A]C[Was this right? Or is it worth too little at this point in the game?

s: It's small and gote.  I think A is the biggest move now, but B and C might be better to play first.  Always look for sente in the end-game.  D is big now too - it's reverse-sente since black playing there is sente.]
;B[bg];W[af];B[bi];W[bj];B[ak]LB[bg:A][an:B]C[What happened here? How could I have prevented this? (Although his actions afterwards puzzled me too.)

s: you could have played A or B first...];W[aj];B[am];W[bl]
;B[bh];W[al];B[bp];W[an];B[ao];W[ib]LB[ps:A]C[s: better - this is a good sente move for the end-game.  I think A is still better though.]
;B[hc];W[hb];B[gb];W[ob];B[pb]
(;W[nr];B[hn];W[ho];B[ko]C[Would L4 be best for W here? His attacks seemd pointless but I realise now that they were sacrifices.]

;W[fo];B[el];W[fk];B[dm];W[cm];B[dk];W[dl]C[Obviously this should have been at C10.]
;B[ek];W[fj];B[cj];W[eo]C[After this, it's largely filling in the edges, but if there is anything notable I have missed, feel free to mention it.]

Bluebottle [11k\]: thank you too
Bluebottle [11k\]: it certainly was
Pheidole [12k\]: again sometime.

s: Thank you again for letting me review your game.  I hope my comments have been useful.  Overall I think you need to focus on keeping your stones connected and cutting apart your opponent's stones.  Also, try not to play a forcing move just because you can - every move should serve your ultimate goal of winning the game.  I know this is hard to do - I commit "aji-keshi" all the time myself!]
