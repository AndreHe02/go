C[Hey. My name is Greg and I took a look at your game. I prefixed all my comments with GC and tried to add as many variations as possible. Please take a look.

If you have any followup questions, feel free to email me. (gtc.cole@gmail.com)]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[jq]C[P: I though this was a good way to take profit in sente and move on to take an open corner.

GC: Indeed. Black approaching with the thrid move seems hasty, but is fine. White can either play calmly like you did, or play somewhere else. Both are fine. However, it means black won't be able to play a large fuseki.]
;W[dc];B[cp]TR[dm]SQ[cf]C[GC: Instead of approaching at D7 here, I might have just enclosed the corner at C14. My thinking is that black's position on the bottom is thick, but somewhat low. Even if black extends along the left side, the C14 stone will help keep that moyo under control, and you can still easily go in at E4 later. I've added a few variations to show.]

(;W[dm]C[P: I treated b's bottom side like it was a chinese fuseki, but I think this move was bad. Reviewing chinese fuseki moves for w after the game, many of the patterns following this move hinge on weakening the k3 stone. But here, k3 is quite strong, so my position on the left became thin.]
;B[ep];W[dj];B[ch]C[P: b probably realizes this and attacks immediately. Or they're  abit of a maniac, which is what I suspected at the time, based on their immediate approach in the bottom right.

GC: This move indeed does not seem best at the moment. I think playing the corner enclosure / pincer is fine. Since the D10 and D7 stones are high up on the 4th line, they are light and can run easily.]
;W[cf];B[eh]TR[bp]SQ[gj]C[GC: I agree with you comment. You should just leave the corner for later, there are better moves there than B4. If you run to the center now, black will have to do the same. Both of your groups are weak. Your stones are light, and I would play lightly.]

(;W[bp]C[P: I wanted to stabilize the two white stones on line d in sente so that I could return to the top, and this seemed a way to do it. Looking at it now though, it's madness to help b consolidate the corner so early. Better just to run into the centre.]
;B[bo];W[co];B[do];W[cn];B[bq];W[ef]C[P: So I got my move on the top...

GC: Yeah... Black gained a lot of this exchange and your group isn't even that much more stable.]
;B[bn];W[bm];B[bj];W[an];B[ap];W[cj];B[bk]C[P: B seems to have gotten tricked here

GC: Indeed this was okay for white. However, there is a slightly better way to do this. You do lose a lot of territory this way. See variation.]
;W[bi];B[ci]
(;W[bh];B[bg];W[cg];B[ah];W[dh];B[ai];W[di]
(;B[cl]C[P: I felt pretty comfortable with this outcome, but perhaps its bad to throw away the c6 stones after playing a sequence there that gave b so many points in the corner.

GC: This result should be better for black, but C8 is a bad move. Black should have extended at N17 and black is still doing good.]
;W[nc];B[lc]TR[jc]C[Instead of the coutner pincer, I would play more simply here. The jump into the center is good enough.]

(;W[jc];B[db]TR[cb]SQ[ec]C[GC: Instead of playing in the corner, I would extend to the right. There may be aji left in the corner later, but the cetner is much more important right now, and the E17 stone helps white a lot.]

(;W[cb];B[eb];W[cc];B[hc]C[GC: This sequence was poor for black.]
;W[kd];B[ec];W[ld]C[GC: This move feels really good.];B[ib]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[qh];B[oc];W[nd];B[od]
;W[jb];B[ed];W[gb];B[hb];W[ge];B[gc]TR[bf]SQ[nm]C[GC: B14 feels small right now. I would rather play in the lower right. Black playing P7 right now is really strong. All of the groups on the board are stable, and the question goes back to now where is the biggest move. The lower right is the most open and is the border of two moyos. Must play spot.]

(;W[bf];B[he]C[GC: Black should just immediately play P7. You can also just ignore this and play O7.]

(;W[hf];B[ie];W[if];B[je];W[kg];B[gd];W[nm]CR[he][ie][je]C[GC: Ah there we go. Actually, those exchanges at the top benefitted white. Black didn't gain anything with the three circled stones.]
;B[om];W[on];B[pm];W[pn];B[ok]TR[qk]SQ[nl]C[GC: Seems to me like if you want to fight, you have to play O8. The shape is too good for him otherwise.]

(;W[qk];B[nl];W[mm];B[ml];W[lm];B[kk]C[GC: Black gets away super easily. You could have been more aggressive here. However, this should be okay for you. Black's territory on the bottom becomes way smaller.]
;W[mj];B[ll];W[jm];B[ni];W[nh];B[mh];W[ng];B[mi]TR[lp]SQ[hq]
[lr]C[P: From this point on, I wanted to play in the top right corner. I'm sure there are many bad moves in this game, but letting black play first in the upper right feels like the losing error to me. But I didn't think I could play there right away, because it still felt small

GC: Agreed. That is small now. The main area to focus on is the bottom. However, M4 is a bit of a waste. The two places I would consider at M2 and H3. See variations.]

;W[gn];B[im];W[jl];B[hk];W[jk];B[ki];W[jj];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj]
;W[ql]C[P: Closing the right side up some feels big, but it lets black link up

GC: Black is already alive. Linking up here doesn't really seems to matter much. Fixing the side is huge, and you get sente.]
;B[og];W[fm];B[fl];W[cm];B[bl];W[el];B[fk];W[ek];B[gm];W[fn]
;B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[lb];B[de]TR[ce]SQ[rd]C[GC: S16 seems bigger than C15 here. Black doesn't have that great follow ups in the top left.]

(;W[ce];B[rd];W[re];B[se]C[P: Quite painful. I should have read out the consequences of b playing here first, but I didn't. So many points go down the drain now...]

;W[le];B[ne];W[mf];B[bd];W[cd];B[bb];W[bc];B[ba]C[P: Reviewing the game now, it seems conspicuous that b made so many more points on the top than I did, in spite of how many stones I initially invested, including making local sacrifices on the left twice for first move there. I'm not sure where the error there was, though I definitely struggled for a reply after black pincered my approach stone.

GC: Black actually invested quite a number of stones, and you gained thickness, but you never used it. I think the problem was failing to attack the group on the right when he entered your moyo. You could have played more strongly. Also, I think black gained a little in the endgame. You had chances, but you missed the big one at S16.]
