C[zinger: hello!  Thanks very much for this review.  Your time is appreciated.

I played black in this game.  I am ranked 4k on KGS.

I chose this game because it was close and had a little of everything: joseki/fuseki issues, a few life and death problems, a large scale attack, and a close yose where every move mattered.  The yose is of particular interest to me, since it is harder for me to find my own errors there.

I've sprinkled comments and questions at various points, but please don't limit your thoughts to these points - comment anytime you think it is important.  After all, the most important mistakes to correct are the ones we overlook completely :)

Hi!

Ok, I'll try... hope the comments help :)];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dc];B[oc]C[zinger: my standard opening as black.];W[qj]C[zinger: this is what most of my opponents play.

-----

Not only yours :)];B[ce]LB[de:B][qh:A]C[zinger:  A is also big, but I thought the kakari was more urgent.  Is there any reason to prefer the move played vs. B?

-------

The played move or B?! Please send a mail to Go Seigen to get this question answered :)]
;W[ch];B[cc]LB[fc:D][gc:E][ed:B][ee:A][fe:C][df:F][eg:G][dh:H]
C[zinger:  I'm weak on joseki.  I think that A-E are also possible, but I'm not sure how to choose among them.

-------

There is nothing wrong with the move you played. Among the moves you gave, "A" is bad: see Ishida vol. 1 p.47 dia. 5. I have never seen "D", but "F", "G", "H" are also possible, and of course you can tenuki, too.
It's the first joseki, so there should be a wide range of these moves playable here.]
;W[cb];B[dd];W[bc];B[ec];W[cd];B[db];W[cc];B[ed]LB[ee:A]C[zinger:  Ishida gives A as the move.  I guess that means my move is mistake.

--------

Yes, but no serious one....];W[be];B[cf];W[bf]LB[id:A][qh:B]
C[Now you played A, but maybe B is better, building up the black position and attacking the white stone. A only builds up the upper side (the black stones in the top left are strong and need no extension).]
;B[id];W[qg]C[A fine move!];B[ql]LB[fq:A]C[zinger: I also considered A.

A is at least more interesting - I am not sure about "better" :)]
;W[jq];B[cn]LB[og:B][eh:E][ok:A][cq:C][pq:D]C[zinger: should black attack at A or B instead?

------------

A is bad, because there is no black moyo at the bottom which this move helps to build up. B should be possible, but there are two more moves worth consideration: C and D. In positions like this,  the 3-3 points are quite important. For example, if you invade at C and end with sente there, you could play E for a nice position, reducing the white moyo and building up the black. The left side (where you got a position) is not that interesting.]
;W[gq]LB[fp:A]TR[jq]C[zinger: this seemed passive.

-----------------

A bad move, should be at A, which makes much better balance with the marked stone.]
;B[bp]C[This, again, should be at 3-3. By the way, the large knight move (g3) is often played instead of the small one (f3) in order to make it more difficult for black to slide to b4, because....]
;W[cq]LB[fq:A]TR[dp][gq]C[... now  the marked stones make a better shape than c3, d4 and A.]
;B[ck];W[nq]C[White, too, should invade. His position at the bottom is much to low and to solid.]
;B[pq]LB[pn:A][no:D][lq:C][oq:B]C[zinger: I thought about this for a while.  A seemed overconcentrated, and B would give white good shape.  The move played is solid and has potential follow-up moves at C and D.  Is this correct?

-----------

Excellent move :)];W[qn]LB[qo:A]C[zinger:  I didn't expect this.  Was the following sequence reasonable?

------

We'll see :) A is maybe a better invasion point, though.];B[pm]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[qm]C[Interesting!];B[rm]LB[qk:A][pl:B]C[zinger:  perhaps simply A was better.

------------

Yes, but connecting at B is best :)];W[pl];B[qk];W[pn];B[om]
;W[on];B[nm];W[nn];B[mm];W[pk]C[???];B[pj];W[rn];B[sl];W[rj]
;B[pi];W[qh];B[ok]LB[np:C][rp:B][rq:A]TR[pp][pq]C[zinger:  Even in review, I'm not sure who got the best of this.  Black got alot of strength above, but  white took alot of profit.  On the other hand, white may decide to add a move to finish killing the marked black stones.  Black to play and live in the bottom right: what do you think?

---------

I think white lost his cool in this fight :) q9 was terrible... There is lots of aji in the corner (maybe starting with B is better), but C is also possible, and I think Black can play there immediately. All in all, I prefer Black here.]
;W[og]
(;B[mg]LB[nf:A][np:B]C[zinger:  right direction?

--------

Of course :) A, simply taking the upper side, is also worth consideration, and, as mentioned, there is B at the bottom.]
;W[ne];B[md];W[lf]LB[qe:A]C[This hardly works. Maybe attaching at A?]
;B[of]LB[nf:A]TR[mg]C[zinger: complicated here.  Suggestions?

-----------

Go is a complicated game :) No, the peaceful variation started with A instead of the marked stone. Since White is so thin, cutting is ok.]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[mh];B[mf];W[nh];B[lh];W[li];B[mi];W[pf];B[oe]
;W[qe];B[rd];W[pd];B[pc];W[re]C[zinger: another life and death problem: black to play, can he kill?  I couldn't quite read it out, so I tried to make white live small.

-------------

Hm, maybe a better approach would be: It's enough to win, so I make white live small. If letting White live leaves you behind, you have to go for the kill!]
;B[ph];W[rf];B[pg];W[pe];B[eh]LB[nd:B][od:A][lg:C]C[zinger: I thought my result on the right was good.  Unfortunately I overlooked that white A-black B-white C is double atari.  This hurt later - I think I should play A at some point.

-----------

If you want to connect, please do so at C - this stone will have a much bigger impact on the later course of the game than a stone at A.]
;W[mn];B[km];W[dj]C[zinger: strange looking.

---------

But not bad....];B[fj];W[dk];B[cl];W[or]LB[rp:A]C[zinger:  white adds a move to kill.  But it's obviously gote.

White is behind, hard to imagine there is time for this. At least, he should play A, trying to kill  while eleminating the black sente endgame there.]
;B[fl]LB[od:A]C[zinger: here black should play A and secure the win.  White seems to have about 70 points, black has at least 90.

--------

The move you played is fine.];W[rr]LB[sn:B][rp:A]C[zinger:  I don't think this was necessary.

Me too :) And even if it is, A or B is the move.];B[ln];W[lo]
;B[ko];W[kp];B[jo];W[od]
(;B[nd]LB[me:A]C[zinger:  sadly, I still could have saved the situation with A.  But I played in a rush, missing the obvious.

---------------------

Well.... :)];W[lg];B[me];W[kh];B[jg]C[zinger:  white is still very weak, but i didn't kill him, or accomplish anything at all really.  I feel like there must have been better for black over the next 30 moves or so.

It's hard to stay cool after something like this :)];W[ii];B[kj]
;W[lj];B[mj]LB[kk:A]TR[mi]C[zinger: perhaps A instead - it probably doesn't matter if white captures the marked stone.

---------

A looks fine.];W[mk];B[nj];W[kk];B[jj];W[jk];B[ij];W[ik];B[hj]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[hm];B[ll];W[lk];B[hl]LB[jh:A]C[zinger: it looks like yielding with A would still be enough for black to win.

--------

After a fight has started, we amateurs tend to think only about that fight. When you look at the position, you will realise that both Black and White haven't played a move concerned with territory for nearly 20 moves now! Thus, ending this with A would have been an excellent idea :)]
;W[hk];B[gl];W[gj];B[hi];W[gk];B[fk];W[gi];B[hh];W[gh];B[hg]
;W[gg];B[gf];W[eg];B[ff]LB[iq:A]C[zinger: finally giving up the chase, hoping that A will be enough to win.

--------

Here, you don't secured that much territory....];W[ei];B[iq]
;W[lq];B[ip];W[fh]LB[cj:A]C[zinger: I think this was unnecssary.

---------

A pass.... As at the bottom, White misses to play moves that combine the wanted with taking territory. Locally, a move doing this would be A.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[fq]
(;W[bq]LB[gp:A]C[zinger:  white could try resisting with A, but it looks like black can still live (variations).

---------

Yes, White is to weak here. B e3 was fine!];B[gp];W[bo];B[bn]
;W[ap];B[dr]C[zinger: the game looks very close: black about 68, white about 62, prisoners even, 6.5 komi.  Hence every yose move will be very important.  Was this the right start?

--------------

You remember the Go Seigen thing? :) But d2 makes profit while threatening a weak group - can't be wrong! And please forget about the above counting - anyone who could do it this exactly would be 4d pro, not 4k or 4d at KGS like the both of us.]
;W[cr];B[bi];W[bh];B[ci];W[dh];B[ke];W[fp];B[gr];W[go];B[hp]
;W[im];B[dl];W[gm];B[ak]C[zinger:  necessary? another life and death problem.

----------

Since there are no moves left bigger than the white sente moves here, it's a good move anyway.]
;W[em];B[el];W[eb]C[Very big.];B[fb];W[da];B[ir]LB[fa:A]C[zinger: perhaps A, reverse sente, is bigger.  I think white should have played there next.

-----

Indeed!];W[ef];B[ls];W[mr]C[This is small.];B[sn];W[ro];B[so]
;W[sp];B[sm];W[rp];B[fa]C[Good yose by Black :)];W[de];B[ee]
;W[df];B[sj]C[zinger: looks like a mistake, due to shortage of liberties below.

------

Not a serious mistake, though.];W[rh];B[se];W[sf];B[sd];W[si]
;B[ol];W[sk];B[rl];W[le];B[ld];W[kd];B[kc];W[jh];B[if]LB[ih:A]
C[Was there anything wrong with A?!];W[ih]C[To small.];B[an]
;W[co];B[qi];W[ri];B[kr]LB[dn:A]C[zinger:  A looks bigger.

--------

Anything should be bigger :)];W[dq];B[er];W[jr];B[js];W[lr]
C[???];B[dn];W[en];B[do];W[eo];B[fm];W[fn];B[ah];W[ag];B[ai]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[dm];B[cm];W[ho];B[jm]LB[ao:A]C[zinger:  wrong again.  A is a free point.]

;W[il];B[sk]LB[kf:A]C[zinger:  forgetting A, which is a full point. This almost cost me the game!]

[fr][hr][es][fs][gs][hs]C[zinger:  and black won by a half point.  phew!

-----------------

:) But you deserved the win - I think you played the better Go during the opening, the middle game and the end game. There was this blunder, of course ;)

If yopu are not sure about the status of the groups involved in this game, maybe doing some more tsumego is a good idea. Otherwise, your game is quite balanced.

Good luck with your next games!])
