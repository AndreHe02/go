C[Hello,

I played black in this game.

I made 3 very stupid blunders that cost me several points. But besides this, on which I can only rely on myself to correct, I would like to know :

- what are the moves by White that you judge I should take profit from (because I'm not able to 'see' them by myself), and reasons why.

- There was no group really endangered in this game (apart the black top group, but that was on purpose). To that extent, one might judge this game not very thrilling.
Nevertheless, I had the tendency to try to build potential rather than to attack or reduce White (because I thought it was bigger).
This is the sense of moves 13, 15, 67, 89.
I'd like to have your feedback on my appreciation.

Any other useful comment is welcome.

It favors black in territory.];W[od];B[dp];W[cn];B[fq];W[ci]
;B[pj];W[jd];B[jj]C[what else ?
If I play on the side, W might play there himself.

If I invade, I am likely to end up gote, and having helped W creating influence.

I'm not strong enough to make full profit with a reduction play (D10 / D12)



I think you can play D15 to approach the top white corner, at the same time split white moyo into 2 parts. The current move has a high likelyhood to gain little. Think that when white moyo is splitted, K10 becomes unnecessary.]
;W[lj]C[This move can consider O2 or D15 as a better alternative. The goal is to reduce the value of K10 while making profit. The current move also has no profit.]
;B[jh]C[I will still go back to D15, and take the exchange between K10 and M10 as a sento benefit.]

These moves made a white wall, which helps white to invade into black moyo easily latter, which a loss.]
;W[kd];B[lc];W[ld];B[nb]MA[mb]C[This was a 'stone-o' (live game, not internet).
I was disconcentrated when I played this stone. I meant to play N18 of course.


In either way, making a like at the upper silde is not something that you can do happily, expecially that it also makes the center group weaker and subject to later attack, and that it also reduces the territory of black's upper right corner. I think black chosed a wrong direction here.]

Because you missed these moves, white gained a lot in his next couple of moves.]
