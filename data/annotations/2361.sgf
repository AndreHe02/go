(;B[cj]LB[ce:B][de:A]C[csh: This move is a little odd. Usually you play this move when you are afraid of the pincer. However, it is also important to prevent White from enclosing the corner as well. Since the board is so open, both approach moves are playable. See variations for some examples. I included one variation for each approach.]
;W[cl]C[csh: When White plays here...];B[cg]C[csh: Black needs to extend to make a base...]
;W[ce]C[csh: ... and White still gets the shimari in the corner.]
;B[pj];W[jd];B[jp]
(;W[eg]C[csh: This is a bad attack on the black group. The stone is not connected to anything, and can be a liability later.]
;B[dh];W[ci]C[csh: Generally, it is better to enclose a group before trying to take away vital points and kill it. This move ends up being wasted.]
;B[di];W[bj];B[bi];W[ck];B[ch]
(;W[qf]LB[nc:A]C[csh: This approach is in the wrong direction. While it does break up Black's side, it does not work with the white stones above. White would be better off using the support of the marked white stone and approach at A (O17.)]

(;B[qh]C[csh: This pincer is in the wrong direction. I see the joseki that Black is trying to play, but the direction is wrong.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[HikaruFan : Would it make a difference here if black had played at R 16 instead ?

csh: See the variation.];W[qd];B[pe]
(;W[pf]LB[qe:A][re:B]C[csh: White has to be careful with moves like these. There are problems with the wedge at A (R15) and the peep at B (S15).]

(;B[ld];W[kc];B[lc];W[ph];B[pi];W[oh];B[oi]LB[nj:A]C[csh: This move does little for Black. It is also an empty triangle and bad shape. If you want to move towards the center of the board, a jump to A (O10) is better shape and faster.]
;W[qg];B[rh];W[rg];B[fp];W[eo];B[fo];W[ne];B[nd];W[oe];B[od]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[csh: Again, this approach is in the wrong direction.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[mp]C[csh: This move is also dangerous, because of the same attacks in the upper right.]

;B[gq];W[fr];B[gr];W[eq];B[mi];W[kn];B[jn]C[csh: It isn't good shape to attach like this. The cuts will be hard to handle.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[lm];B[mm];W[ml];B[nl];W[mk];B[nk];W[em]C[HikaruFan : Instead of E 7, would a play at F 7 or F 8 be bigger?

csh: When you are ahead, it's better to stay strongly connected. However, I think a play at the top of the board would be bigger.]

;B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[ji];B[nh];W[ng];B[jc];W[jb];B[kb]C[HikaruFan : I think that  white would be more pressurised if Black had played at around J 18 and start a ko fight

csh: With this play, Black made five or more points in sente. When I look at the score, I would estimate that White is ahead by more than fifteen points. I think Black needs to invade to get back in the game. There is also a severe attack at the lower right.]
;W[hb];B[bk]C[csh: This is gote. It is better to play sente moves first.]

(;B[ap]C[csh: This is the wrong move. It doesn't help make shape, and it's gote after White protects.]

(;B[bc];W[bd];B[ad];W[dg];B[cb];W[db]
(;B[bb]C[HikaruFan : Instead of B 18, Black would have gotten 1-2 more points if he had connected at C 17 right?
