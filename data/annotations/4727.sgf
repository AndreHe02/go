C[Hi my name is Thomas, i will review your game.

When  i write see var. --> there is a variation (or more)
But the variations i show you are only those i could think of. I still have much to learn so i may have forgotten a few variations that were "more correct". 

To answer your questions, you made a lot of mistakes wich is normal. Black made a little less mistakes than white though.
I insisted on the beginning of the game, opening situations... If you want to learn more about it, you can download Kogo's joseki dictionnary (joseki = best sequence for W & B) It deals with opening moves (fuseki) and is really complete, this is what i used for this review. You can find it on the internet.

Some advices for Black and White:
 Try to make your stones work together. Think about a way to link them or not to endanger them before playing.
 To attack a group prefer non-contact moves to ... contact moves.
 Non contact moves are more powerful if one can find onethat help your own stones and attack the oppponent's.
 BEWARE OF CUTTING POINTS. White had a  lot of cutting points due to the fact that the stones were badly connected.]

(;B[od]LB[qc:B][qd:A]C[For the first four moves players usually take the corners ( as you did). Several moves are possible.
See var.
This move is unusual.  However it is possible, but is influence-oriented and leaves many possibilities for white to approach, and for black to answer. Wich leads to very complicated fights.

According to kogo's joseki dictionnary (available on the internet, just google it), white's approach moves are A and B]
;W[cp];B[pp]LB[ep:B][eq:A]C[B3 is good since it is on the open side of the lower left corner. Later black can aim at an approach at A, or B]
;W[dd];B[qj]LB[qe:C][fd:B][eq:A]TR[pp]SQ[od]C[B5 doesn't feel right, as it is in contradiction with black's first two moves (influence oriented moves), but it isn't wrong!
Different available moves are A ( making use of the triangled stone),  B (making use of the squared stone), or C ensuring territory]
;W[nq]C[Good approach by white. Could also consider the extension at E3.]

(;B[or]C[The usual answer is Q6. See var.]
(;W[qn]C[Leaving the triangled stone alone is dangerous you should reinforce it as black's previous move gives you the possibility to do so. See var.]

(;B[pn]C["You should not touch what you are attacking." 
Go proverb.

Therefore, one way of attacking this invasion is to play somewhere where it takes away its eye shape and oblige him to run out to the center while you take profit.
One possible move could be A];W[ql]
(;B[pl]C[Same advice, Black should make sure that the corner is safe.]
;W[pq]TR[ql][qn]SQ[nq]C[White should either defends his triangled stones or the squared one. This move just makes black stronger.]

;B[pj]C[No need to protect this cutting point.]

;W[rm];B[pm];W[qi];B[pi];W[qh];B[ph];W[jd]LB[fq:B][eq:A]C[White still has the corner enclosure at A.
He could also play B trying to minimize black's wall influence. I'm not sure though.]
;B[lc]C[Black could also use his wall by playing around E3, this allows him to create a lot of potential territory.]
;W[kc];B[lb];W[kb];B[ka];W[ja];B[la];W[ib]LB[qd:A][qc:A]C[This is good for  white i would say, since black's corner is still open at R17, or R16 (A).]
;B[he]LB[fc:A]C[What is black trying to do?

- reducing white's territory? 
 - It is better to invade deeper, at A for example.

-attacking the white group?
 - impossible

It just creates a weak group to take care of while white is able to turn his potential territory into real territory. See Var. next move

Black can play R16, it is quite big or still E3.]
(;W[hd]C[As i said earlier, contact moves are not the best option. Eventhough it is tempting! Black can hane (diagonal move in contact with an opponent stone) wich he did and it creates complicated fights where white has the more to lose.

Black wins by 33.5.

Overall Black played a good game building huge walls on both sides of the board and making some captures.
White played following black's intentions. Don't fear to play a move that seems important to you. Try to evaluate the value of two different moves (although it is really hard). White seemed to be crawling under black most of the time wich allowed black to form two beautiful walls facing each other. He also let one of his group getting captured because he didn't make sure that it was safe. 
Don't leave an area of the board before you feel your groups are completely SAFE. Spending an extra move to make you feel better is nothing compared to the loss of your lower group.]
