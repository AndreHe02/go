C[Hi there.

Thanks a lot for this review! I played as white, and I'm looking for general comments on my play as well as analyses of my specific errors.

Some thoughts and questions throughout.

Thanks again!
mlansman

JJHaggar: Hi, mlansman, I'll try to help as much as I can by pointing the moves that I don't like (I'll do this for both sides because I think it's important to understand the errors of the rival for a better understanding of own errors).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq]
(;W[nd]C[JJHaggar: Not bad, but maybe not the best direction of play (look at the variations)]
;B[pf];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc]
(;B[qe]C[I'm not used to this response.
Was my reply correct?

JJHaggar: Yes];W[jc]TR[qb]C[JJHaggar: yes, your reply was correct (joseki moves are good 99% times), but black lost some points in this exchange. He is overconcentrated and later in yose you can play R18, that is very painful for black]
;B[df]
(;W[dj]TR[fc][fd]C[I went for this wide pincer because I wanted to develop my bottom left corner.

JJHaggar: I cannot say that is a bad move, but is for sure a complicated one, because probably you will have to manage a double kakari to your upper left corner. I would prefer to play the variation of F16 white]
;B[fd]TR[fc][cf]C[JJHaggar: He seems to control the center access with those two black stones, and apparently he won't win anything by making a wall there, so maybe you should just keep your corner (it would be different if the stones were around F17 and C14)]

[hp][ip][fq][gq][hq][iq][jq]TR[fd][pk][fp][jp]SQ[ee][ef]C[I decided to invade rather than protect the squared group because I felt that they weren't that important, due to the triangled piece. I also consider playing in the circled region.

-Do you think this was right?

JJHaggar: Yes, the squared group isn't important now, I think you should play one of the triangled marked stones (R9 is also good, just maybe a bit low)]

Any comments about my style of play in, general tips about my overall weak points, or general tips on how to improve.


JJHaggar: I like your style of play, but I think you should try to improve 2 things:
-A bit more fighting spirit. For that matter I would recomend to play a lot in 9x9 with black against 6,5 komi, open in tengen and wight to death every game ;) 
-Life & dead. goproblems.com is a good resource of these problems
JJHaggar: It is usually very good to understand and learn proverbs... not just in go, but in real life, but for the Go ones try "sensei's library" on google, they have lots of proverbs (and a lot of more info)
