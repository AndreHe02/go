C[The win was (as my teacher likes to say) "lucky." I don't much believe in luck in go, but your opponent missed his chance to connect and lost a won game.

The reason you had a weak exploitable group on the top side was because you didn't recognize that a stone was dead. It is best to leave weak stones near enemy thickness for aji, and connect to them only if your outside groups are strong. Instead you should have kept your distance while threatening to connect and get more on the outside.

sylvainc [8k?\]: have a good game
Zwom [12k\]: enjoy.

Typically I prefer getting reviews of games that I lose, but I decided against that principle in that it's a tournament game (Torneo Iwamoto 05), and I was very dominated for awhile til I found a way out of a very complicated situation that I would like someone better to address.  I'm reminded of a wise phyics professor's comments "even a blind squirrel can trip on an acorn."  How and when I needed to prevent the weak group is my principle question.   I think the game gets decided early, by move 84, so reviewing past that point I don't think is that necessary.]

(;W[pm];B[nq];W[qj]LB[ql:A]C[The move at R10 is too narrow. If you play Q7, the intention is to extend to R11.

Otherwise the solid play at Q6 is better - then this extension makes more sense and has no weaknesses.

Now there is still a weakness at A. (See variation).]
(;B[fq]C[This seems like the wrong direction for black. Playing at P16 is best.

This side is low (O3), so it is not interesting for B. If the approach must be made, it should be at C6.]

;W[pe];B[oc];W[nd];B[nc]C[This gives black a very big territory in the UR.]
;W[of]TR[id][pe][qe][qj][pm]C[This is an ok result... White is banking on a moyo in this area instead of corner territories.

The corner territory is very large for black, but white has some moyo on the left side. Black's best move now is probably an invasion on the left, or a moyo play on the top side.

The J16 stone should not be included with the "working well together" stones you've marked. J16 should be considered dead with aji unless it becomes worth saving.

---

At this point I felt I handled the opening pretty well, I was happy to get a wall that had eye shape in the direction of my other stones.]
;B[on]C[Better than tenuki, you should have played P7. If Black takes a stone in sente, you're left with better moyo.

It is still a large capture by black, though!

----

I stared at this move for a while and wanted to tenuki, but in the end I figured he would just capture the stone in sente if I tenukied.]
;W[pn];B[le];W[dj]TR[ci]C[The single stone is dead now.

This higher point works better with your Lower left corner, but it does leave weaknesses behind. Black is doing well to cover his weaknesses, so white's position is not looking very good. Playing more safely with C11 is also not good because it would start to put white behind... the opening is definitely better for black because he has gotten a good moyo on the top side and very big corners in the UR and LL.

----

I was happy to get this point.  In retrospect however I'm wondering if c11 wouldn't be better because The shape has less of a weakness and I have a very weak stone at j16.  Would it have been better to ignore the side all together and help the single stone?]
;B[fg];W[if]C[Escaping with this stone is bad. If black plays F13, White covers the weakness with D12.

J16 is already dead.];B[dh];W[eg];B[eh];W[fh]C[White is strong, so cutting is good]
;B[ef];W[dg];B[fi];W[gh];B[ej];W[ch];B[ci]C[This move is greedy, but white can't fall into the trap.]
;W[di]C[The trap...];B[ei];W[bh]C[defending here is good, but it would be better to do this before W played D11.]
;B[dk];W[cj];B[ck];W[bj];B[em]C[Black gets a good result like this.]
;W[gg];B[ff];W[lg];B[je]C[Aji stones are light. You sacrifice when you cannot connect and live.

--

How do you know when to sacrifice?  I felt the stone could be that light in that black's territory would be on the second line were it to live or the fifth line were it to die.]

(;W[ie]C[you attached too much importance on J16.];B[kg]
(;W[lh]C[Normally this is a good move...

Now it allows black to split J15 off. There is probably no other way, but your only chance now is to be allowed to connect.]

;B[bl];W[el]C[This is an excellent move. Black is dead and can only live if a liberty was left over. See variation.

----

This to me I think saves the day, I've posted it on goproblems.com and a couple are convinced white can't get away with this because white's lower left stones are two weak.  To me this move seems rigorous.  Can black save his stones?    That is my last question and I think this decides the game but the opponent didn't resign til the last few moves of the game.]

(;B[fl];W[fm]C[If a liberty on the D6 chain were open, this would be alive at D8

This capture is very big, though it certainly looks as though black is still doing ok. The moyo at the bottom must be explored.]
