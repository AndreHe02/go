GC[white resigns after successful invasion by black in upper right corner]


;B[qd]C[dbriggs (White) wrote (in part): "As you'll see, though I'm not quite
sure how, I failed to prevent an incursion on the top left and failed at an
invasion of my own on the right side."

Hi,

My comments on this game concentrate on the early stages, where I think
White had several chances to gain the advantage, and  on some missed
possibilities in the middle, when White was well behind but still had some
play.

The two invasions you ask about happened after the game was effectively
decided; I've commented on them as well, since you asked.

Please bear in mind that I'm not a strong player myself, so if anything I
say seems wrong to you, try testing it!

I've added various marks and variations as part of my comments.  I think my
SGF editor works all right, but please let me know if you have a problem
seeing any of them.  I've also used co-ordinates to described marked stones
and positions.

--edgy];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pj];W[jd];B[jp];W[dj]C[The game shapes up as a battle of moyos.  White will always have to watch
out for invasions on the 3-3 points, while Black's corners are easier to
make into territory.  On the other hand, White's stones on the 4-4 points
have more influence on the center.];B[jc];W[ic];B[kc];W[id]
LB[kd:a]C[Not necessary.  Better to play 'a' ( L16), pushing Black along the third
line.];B[kd];W[ib]LB[ke:a]C[Small. 'a' (L15) is better, trying to confine Black to the upper side and
expand White's moyo in the center.];B[jb]C[Black should push into the center instead.]
;W[ja]C[Again, L15 is better.];B[ka];W[ia];B[lb]C[Not needed at all.  Black should play L15 himself.]
;W[ke]C[Good move.];B[le]
(;W[kg]C[Loose.  L14 is solid; White is building a larger framework on the upper
left than Black is in the upper right, and he's ahead in the stone's
walking--L14 M14 L13 and if M13, M12 pushes Black again.

Maybe even M14 here,  threatening to cut at M16: if  B cuts with L14,  W
K15 B M13 W M16.

See variations.];B[kf]
(;W[lf]LB[je:a][jf:b]C[Connecting at 'a' (K15)  is important. Then B probably has to defend his
cutting points, so Whte gets in 'b'  (K14) as well.  See variation.]
;B[je];W[ie];B[mf]LB[jg:a]C[I think 'a' might be better for Black here--those two White stones in the
center are in trouble anyway.];W[jf];B[lg];W[ke];B[lf]
(;W[je]C[Small.  Better L12, I think, and White is still ahead.  If black takes
the ko, White can simply connect.  (See variation)];B[kh]C[Big move for Black.]
;W[jg];B[ki]LB[jh:a]C['a' (K12) is more vigorous, pressing White back from the center.]
;W[jj]LB[ii:a]C[This and the next are too loose--black pushes through into White's area.
'a' (J11)  here is more sensible, though I think Black has some advantage,
since he'll be able to extend along the K-line,making a bigger framework
than White, and has better invasion prospects in White's territories.
.];B[kj];W[kk]LB[ji:a][jk:b]C['a' here (K11) is sounder, though Black can then play 'b' (K9).]
;B[ji];W[hi];B[ij];W[jk];B[ii];W[hk];B[hj]
(;W[ik]C[Ugh. Because the sequence  G10, J9, J8, G11 is very good for Black
too(see variation), I can't see anything better,  but now Black bursts
through.];B[gj];W[fk];B[fi];W[fj];B[gi]
(;W[gk]LB[ei:a]C[Much better to play 'a' (E11) here, strengthening the left side more.  A
Black push at G9 is nothing to worry about (see variation), and the
invasion Black makes next would be much harder.];B[cj];W[ci]
;B[ck];W[dk]LB[cm:a][cn:b][ei:c]TR[gk]C[Rule of thumb:  when you're trying to kill an invasion, play away from
the enemy stones.  That limits the space available for him to make eyes.
Contact plays often leave the stone you played vulnerable to a
counter-attack.    Here something like a  (C7)  or b (C6)  limits Black's space.  White would
be happier with a stone on E11 (c) instead of the marked stone (G9),
though, since then Black's D9 wouldn't threaten D11.];B[cl]

(;W[dl]C[It gets harder and harder to kill ths invasion. The sequence D7  C7 C6
(see variation) or C6  immediately seem  better; at least then Black will
live small if at all.];B[cm];W[dm]LB[co:a][dn:b]C[Again here, 'a' (C5) or jumping ahead with 'b' (D6) seem better,
alythough I think Black clearly lives now.];B[cn];W[dn]LB[cp:a]
C[Here it is probably better to shut Black out of the corner with 'a' (C4).]
;B[cp]
(;W[do]LB[cq:a]C[And here 'a' (C3) keeps more of the corner territory (see variation).]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cr];W[co];B[bo];W[dr]TR[jp]C[It's probably better here to start some trouble on the right, perhaps by
trying to cut off the marked stone (K4).  I'll say more about this in a few
moves.];B[ds]LB[mp:a]C[And here Black 'a' is bigger, consolidating the lower side.]
;W[es];B[cs]TR[jp]C[Now Black has devestated White's potential territory, and is way ahead.
White will have to invade the right side. to have any chances at all.  An
invasion in the upper right is hard, because Black has so much thickness
there.   But, White has one strong feature:  walls on the left and in the center
facing the lower side, so attacking the marked stone (K4)  should be a good
idea, possibly in combination with an approach to the lower right corner
around R5.]
(;W[gp]LB[lp:a][mp:b][qo:c]C[Wrong direction.  This does nothing to reduce Black's framework.    'a'
(M4) or 'b' ( N4)  is better; then Black's K4 stone would be in trouble,
and W can aim at an invasion around 'c' (R5).

The problem is, the stone White just played is too near White's walls of
stones.  "Play away from thickness" is a good proverb--playing around N4
would drive Black towards that thickness, which would be very
uncomfortable.  White could end up with a big territory on the lower side
to compensate for his losses elsewhere.  See the variation.]
;B[hp];W[hr];B[ir]LB[lq:a]C[A move around 'a' (M3) seems more solid.]
;W[hq]C['a' (J3) splits up Black's stones.  Things are messier then, and White
*needs* something messy now.];B[iq];W[ho];B[ip];W[hm]LB[nq:a]
[np:b]MA[gq][go][er]C[Now Black has ruined White's potential on the lower side, too. It might
still be worth trying 'a' or 'b' intending to extend towards Black's K4
group if Black seals off the corner..    White is in great difficulty.  Aside from being well behind on territory,
there are cutting poins(marked)  all over on the lower left side.]
;B[io];W[is]LB[hn:a]C[This is small and leaves dangerous cuts at for Black.  H6 ('a')  is
probably necessary sooner or later.];B[js];W[hs];B[kr];W[ko]
C[Right idea, trying to reduce Black's lower side, but those cutting points
are going to be nasty.];B[mo];W[km]LB[lm:a]C['a' (M7) instead might be a little more effective.  Also, White is
running out of room to invade the lower right.  The more stones Balck gets
to play to consolidate his position there, the harder an invasion gets.]
;B[lm];W[ll];B[mm];W[ml];B[nl];W[kl]LB[nj:a]C[not much point. 'a' (O10) or maybe O9 seems more likely to cause problems.]
;B[mk]C[White's incursion han't cost Black much, and in fact it has thickened
Black's position in the lower side. It will be harder to invade the right
side now.   White doesn't have reasonable play for a win that I can see. From here on
I'm going to basically limit my comments to the invasions at the end that
you asked about.];W[lk];B[mj];W[lj];B[li];W[ln]C[Just forces black to strengthen himself.]

because of all the Black stones in the area, but there's nothing else to do.]

Black's invasion there harder.];B[oc];W[jo];B[dc];W[ec]LB[cc:a]

make eyes).];B[bb];W[db];B[cd];W[bc]LB[bd:a]C[Again, a move like 'a' (B16) seems simpler.  There simply isn't enough
room in the corner for Black to make two eyes then.];B[bd];W[ac]

can't live unless Black blunders badly, much less win.

increase your eye-space as much as possible.)];B[qk]C[Now White just has too little space to make eyes.  Notce that Black

lower right corner and much of the lower right side.
