[RMH\] The time limit was 25 minutes per player.  I'm not sure what the individual move time limit was.  At this stage of my playing, I am a little better at the opening than I was when I was a pure beginner but it is still very easy for me to get behind from the start with a better or equal player.  I will elaborate a bit more during the game.

[KKMD\] Indeed, I wouldn't care too much about your opening strategy. From what I can perceive in this game, here are three weaknesses of yours. 

1) Reading life and death situations. Practice some tsumego problems.

2) You let the opponent surround your groups too easily, you even help him. Even if the choice is between securing a small life and running in the centre, the better thing is usually to break free.

3) You seem to easily lose track of your objectives in small tactical sequences. For example, around move 93, you try to shut black off, but it's as if you got distracted after 2-3 moves and forgot what you were doing.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp]C[[RMH\] When playing white, I almost always play the star points because I am not comfortable enough yet with other moves.]
;B[jd]C[[RMH\] Here I struggle with should I close my side by playing near the bottom start point, the side star point or approach one of black's corners.

KKMD: Both are fine.];W[jq];B[pj];W[dj];B[qn];W[nq]C[[RMH\] My guess is my move at o3 is too slow this early but I was worried about blacks invasion at o3 or o4

KKMD: It is not too slow, answering is normal.];B[rp];W[qq]
LB[sd:B][cg:A]C[[RMH\] Game looks pretty balanced to me so far except black has sente.

Variation B here is a mistake I made while reviewing and I'm not sure how to remove it.]
;B[cg]C[rmhenne [11k\]: lag is bad at least on my side];W[bi]
TR[jq][nq]LB[cc:a][ql:b]C[bluemagic [11k\]: ah

[RMH\]  Unsure if marked stone is a good response.

[KKMD\] It's not a good idea. This move (descent in keima from a stone on the 4th line) is usually aimed at undermining your opponent's position. Here it doesn't affect him much, and if he defends, you may lose some interesting possibilities, like invading at 'A'. Maybe you think your move helps you making territory, but it's also not very efficient in that respect, and anyway at this stage of the game, and especially considering that this one started as a battle of moyos, it's too early to think in terms of territory.

If you think calmly about this position, I think you will see that a move around the tengen is very attractive. But since your marked stones are low, for coherence, maybe you should just invade black's moyo. Also, black left a weakness at 'B', that you could exploit right now.]
;B[bg];W[hc]LB[ql:a]C[[RMH\] With this move, I know I am outnumberd , but I believe I can live and reduce the upper black territtory.  SHould I have invaded the upper right corner instead, strengthened my own territory or something else?  I struggle with these questions in the opening.

[KKMD\] It's a matter of state. Just keep in mind that at some point you will probably need to invade. I will not repeat it again, but here the situation is a made a bit special by the gaping hole at 'A'.]
;B[ec];W[jc]C[[RMH\] Reasonable move or should I have jumped out at this point?

[KKMD\] Looks good.];B[kd];W[kc];B[lc];W[id];B[lb];W[kb]C[[KKMD\] That's a very bad move. Bad shape, small and useless. Jump in the center! Or just tenuki. Almost anything is better. No black is going to push you, thereby building an impressive moyo on the right.]
;B[ie];W[he]C[[RMH\] I do this "Tiger's mouth" move a lot .  IT seems like a strong way to stay connected and hane my opponents stone.  However, I'm not sure if there is a better way to accomplish the same things.

[KKMD\] Here you are absolutely right, there is no other move to consider.]
;B[if];W[fc];B[eb];W[fd]LB[hf:a][fe:b]C[[KKMD\] Too slow. You should run out, with 'A' or 'B' for instance. The same comment applies to your next moves. Letting yourself be surrounded is bad.]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[ef];W[fb];B[gf]TR[ge]C[[RMH\] My tempation was to play at the triangle but I though by pushing past G14, I might be able to push a little further into the center.  By move 57, I see that I was wrong.]
;W[hf];B[hg];W[ff];B[ge];W[hd];B[fg];W[ig];B[je];W[ih];B[kg]
;W[eg]TR[fg][ig][ih]LB[re:a][qf:b][qh:c][ql:d][on:e][fp:f]C[[RMH\] I do dumb moves like this all the time.  I am trying to learn to play slower but I frequently throw stones away.

Would E 12 have been a better move to accomplish the same purpose?  I was hoping to cut the triangle stone but I don't think I can so what I am really trying to do is cap Blacks growth in the upper corner.

[KKMD\] What would E12 accomplish? And what is the use of your marked stones? At this point I would just tenuki at invade, probably at 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D'. But that's dangerous.

[RMH\] A larger question:  I know I lose later by letting black invade the lower left.  SHould I be pushing towards the center from around D10 or O3 at this point?  My invasion around H16 is succesfull but not that damaging compared to what I give up later.

[KKMD\] Your invasion at H17 was certainly not successful! Look at the situation now: you reinforced black on all sides, which gave him the upper left corner and a wall on the right with which he developed his moyo. In return you made a barely living group and threw two  weak stones in the center. Developing your position with something like 'E' followed by 'F' is an option to consider, but might not be enough.]
;B[eh];W[dh];B[dg];W[ei]C[[KKMD\] Not the priority. Black shouldn't answer.]
;B[fi];W[fj];B[gi];W[gd]C[[KKMD\] Even that is way too small. Capturing these stones is worth, what, 5 points? Almost any other move is bigger.]
;B[gg]C[[RMH\] Here I think I have Sente and I have been worried about black's R6 stone moving towards the center over my stones at Q4.  But I block at G10 anyway.  Black moves right in on the lower right.]
;W[gj];B[nn];W[qh]C[[RMH\] My thinking here is that I better invade the upper right side now because soon it will be too blocked off.  So rather than responsde to black's stones at O6, I invade.  THoughts?

[KKMD\] You're right.

[RMH\] I still think I am ahead at this point but I also know I have about a 0% chance of keeping that entire lower left quadrant.  So I guess I am not really ahead.

[KKMD\] That's... confusing.];B[qf];W[qj];B[pi];W[ql];B[qi]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[qm];B[po];W[oo];B[on];W[pl];B[ol];W[rj];B[ri]
;W[pk];B[ok]C[[RMH\] Once again, my invading stones live but I capture very little territory and I believe black is pretty strong pointing into the center.

[KKMD\] Yes, the exchange is favorable to black. What makes it worse is that, actually, your group is dead.

[RMH\] Now looking at the game a little slower, I think black is actually "ahead" since I won't be able to defend the lower left but black has a pretty good chance to keeping what he has surrounded (excepting the small upper right corner I guess).

[KKMD\] Let's count. For black, 23 points in the upper left, and, assuming your group on the right side lives (which it really shouln't), about 55+ points in upper right. You have 8 points on the top, about 6 in the bottom right, and a komi of 6.5 points, so you need 60 more, while preventing black from expanding too much its territory. So, yeah, you've got a difficult game ahead, but it's playable.]
(;W[rk]C[[KKMD\] Not enough, but there was no way to live (see variations).]
;B[rq]LB[rm:a]C[[KKMD\] 'A' instead would have killed.];W[qo]
;B[pn]C[[RMH\] This is a sloppy sequence for me.  I believe I should have connected at R4 and still kept the stones at R8 alive and the stones at R3.]
;W[ro];B[qp];W[rn]C[[KKMD\] Now it's alive.];B[pq];W[op];B[qr]
;W[or];B[hi]LB[pr:a]C[[KKMD\] White can kill at 'A'. Black needs to play 'A' himselft if he wants to live in the corner.]
;W[ik]LB[pr:a]C[[KKMD\] Good.];B[kj];W[kl];B[kn];W[jn];B[jk]
;W[jl]LB[il:a]TR[kl]C[[KKMD\] If you are afraid of the cut, you can always take a step back and play at 'A', but that would mean sacrificing the marked stone.]
;B[il];W[jj]LB[ij:a]C[[KKMD\] 'A' is better.];B[kk];W[hl]LB[ij:a]
C[[KKMD\] Typical case where atari is a bad move. 'A' is better, again.]
;B[im];W[hm]C[[RMH\] THis is another sloppy sequence for me where I loose the stones at K8 & L8 but also let the stones at J7 break into my corner.

I see this sequences way too locally.  Right now I am worried about blacks bigger upper right quadrant but I am about to lose my lower right quadrant.]
;B[jm];W[km];B[in];W[jo];B[lm];W[ll];B[ml];W[ko];B[lk]TR[go]
[ho][hp]C[[RMH\] Rather than pusing at M5 I believe I should have worked to enclose stones at J6, perhaps with H5, G5 or H4.

[KKMD\] Anyway, for all practical purposes, the game is now over.]
;W[lo];B[hn];W[fm];B[ij];W[hk];B[ji];W[qc]C[[KKMD\] Such an invasion, in such a hostile environment, can only be a desperate move.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[pe];W[sc]
LB[ra:a]C[[RMH\] Perhaps I would have been better off shoring up my lower left corner rather than invading the upper right, especially since black does a better job of taking my corner than I do taking his.

[KKMD\] Now black could just kill with 'A'.];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp]
;W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq];B[hp]
;W[go];B[ho];W[gn];B[hq];W[mg]C[[RMH\] THis just turns out to be overplay on my part since I don't have the skill to live in this surrounded area.

[KKMD\] This is an overplay by anybody's standard!];B[nf];W[pf]

;B[lh];W[jh];B[lg];W[nj];B[oj];W[li];B[mh]SQ[ld][ke][le][me]
[mf][mg]C[[RMH\] Playing carelessly and not making sure to keep the marked stones alive.

Should have thought of this several moves ago.

[KKMD\] They were never alive.];W[nh];B[ng];W[hj];B[mp];W[mo]

;B[am];W[bs]C[[RMH\] No real point to this stone.  At this point I thought I might be able to move towards seki if I can push at B2.  But of course it is black's turn and not mine.

[KKMD\] Even if you get a free second move in this corner, I don't see how you can provoke a seki. Your move just loses 1 point and the initiative.]
