C[enmartin [9k\]: hi

dc: Hi, I am dancor 5k on KGS, I'll prefix my comments with dc.  I have comments throughout and some final thoughts at the end.]
;B[ed];W[pp];B[dp];W[pc];B[cj]C[dc: White follows opening principles much better than Black in this opening.  With two-half open corners still Black should play around C16 or Q15 before moving to the sides.  I'm emphasizing Black's opening mistakes, so that we can then talk about proper treatment of an opening lead once you get to the middle game.]
;W[qe];B[dg]C[dc: Again, a play around C16 would be better.]
;W[jd];B[db]C[dc: Black has still not actually enclosed the corner after four moves over here in the opening!  A move around bC16 would enclose the corner, but even that is not good at this point since Black has played too many stones in this corner this early (i.e. C16 would be overconcentrated with respect to E16 and D13).  So bQ10 is probably more reasonable at this point.]
;W[pj];B[dm]C[dc: bK4 is better.];W[jp]C[Black seems to have invested too much energy in the left side of the board to me.

dc: Definitely.  At this point you should see several specific ways that Black has played an inferior opening and White has played a perfect opening.  There is the left-side over-investment that you noted.  Black has also not followed the principle of corners->sides->middle.  Black has spent many stones in the upper left corner, in particular, in a formation that ineffective and inefficient.

dc: So now, given that you know you are in the lead and you know the many reasons _why_ you are in the lead, you should be very prepared to act appropriately in the middle game.  This means playing off the strengths you have created and especially _not_taking_needless_risks_.]
;B[cq];W[gc];B[nj];W[oh]C[dc: White has the lead and should not take risks.  I think wQ12 would be better.  And wQ8 would be better still; wQ8 is better direction: the enclosure in the upper right is much stronger than the lone star-point stone in the bottom right.  You can definitely be satisfied with the 4th-line (the "line of victory") when you are leading!  In general, pushing to the 5th line risks creating a "hole" underneath around the 2nd line which risks problems later.  Also creating the knight-move connection (between wQ10 and wP12) instead of the one-space-jump connection is weaker; definitely prefer stronger connections when you are leading and can afford to do so.]
;B[qo]C[dc: This move is not joseki.  However, Black is losing so avoiding joseki (which are even) is exactly what he wants (to take some risks to try to gain the upper hand).]
;W[qq]C[dc: I didn't like this move wR3.  First of all bR5 is a "shoulder-hit" of wQ4, and the correct response to a shoulder-hit is almost always extending wQ5 or wQ4.  In this case I believe that wQ5 is the better direction of those two.  wQ5 works with wK4 to start staking out a nice area on the right part of the bottom side of the board.  wQ5 also works to disconnect the bO10 and bR5 stones.  

dc: Another weakness of wR3 is this: considering the wQ4 and wR3 stones in isolation, the points where Black can play to best give White "bad shape" (preventing the easy formation of eyes and such) are the four diagonal points bR5, bS4, bP3, bQ2.  In that way, playing wR3 makes the bR5 stone well-placed.

dc: Another consideration is that you _want_ to steer things back to joseki if you can.  If wQ5 is followed by bR4 then we are back to joseki.  If Black resists with bQ6 then wP6 bQ7 wP7 and White is still restraining Black sufficiently and disconnecting bO10.

dc: If you didn't think of wQ5, and just thought about trying to stay with joseki since you are in the lead, you might also consider wO3.  The idea is that bR5 is close to the joseki move of bR6 and we can probably do ok by trying to respond to it similarly.]
;B[rp]C[dc: Black has now covered two of the bad-shape points for the White stones.  Of course White simultaneously covers those points for the Black stones!  But Black is the one who is behind and taking risks so he is probably happy here.]
;W[rq];B[qp];W[qm]C[dc: I guess you are trying to kill the Black stones or maximize the White territory above them?  I don't think either of those things is prudent.  The cutting point of Q3 is scary and Black made the sacrifice of creating an empty triangle for himself to create it.  I like wP4 here.]
;B[qn];W[pm];B[pn];W[np]LB[on:A]C[Maybe I should play at A instead.

dc: I don't think so.  You shouldn't be playing so close to Black unless you know you can capture.  The Black stones have too many liberties and it is better to limit and attack them from afar.]
;B[on];W[om]C[dc: This is a bad move.  This is called "pushing out the toothpaste", since Black can just keep pushing out.  You are also still playing too close to these Black stones.  You must limit and pressure them from afar.  For example, wO8 is already a much better move than wP7 was.]
;B[nn];W[lp]C[dc: This is ok.  It's important to back off ASAP from a local fight where you have played too close.]
;B[nm];W[ok]C[dc: This is not good.  Again we are making bad shape since bO10 is positioned well against the two White stones.  wP9 puts no meaningful pressure on Black; it is a "thank-you move" since the obvious reply bO9 is something Black is dying to find the time to play anyway.  It is also over-concentrated; the wQ10 stone is already well-connected to the 3 stones at wQ7.

dc: Play around wN12 would be more effective to pressure these stones.  It would also contribute to the framework in the upper right.  Even grabbing territory around wG3 would be much better than wP9.]
;B[nk];W[md]C[dc: This is good, leave alone for now the failed attempt at pressuring those Black stones.]
;B[ic];W[jc]C[dc: I really like wJ16 better.  You have enough strength on this side to make bJ17 face it directly and alone.  Even if Black lives underneath, the wall you'll form will be very valuable.  Letting Black get out and cut off wG17 seems to be very much the wrong direction.]
;B[id];W[ie];B[he];W[hd]LB[ib:B][if:A]C[Maybe another idea would be to play at A or B.

dc: You want to reduce risk.  I like A.  After A, Black can solidify the capture of wG17 and then White strengthens the center.  Or Black can dispute the center (perhaps by the "eye-stealing tesuji" at bL14) but then wH16 regains the White stone and captures the two Black stones.]
;B[je];W[if];B[hc];W[gd];B[jb]
(;W[lc];B[gb];W[gf];B[fb];W[kf];B[hf];W[hg];B[jf]C[dc: wJ13 is better here.  The bK15 stones are the bigger problem.  Leaving a forcing move at bF15 seems a less important concern right now.  Black has already succeeded in splitting White with the bK15 stones and that is very important to try to deal with.]
(;W[ge];B[jg];W[lh]C[dc: Good!  This is not as perilously close as your earlier attacks.]
;B[jh];W[ef]C[dc: I prefer wH11 to run while pressuring Black.]
;B[df];W[kj]C[dc: You are pushing the Black stones into your weak White stones on the left.  It's a risk and I still prefer something around wH11.  It is much more important for your group to live than for Black's group to die.]

[ke:H][ei:E][gi:D][el:C][en:B][fp:A]C[Looking back at the game, that's a waste of time here.  Just about anything would be better.

dc: Definitely.  It is dangerous to neglect your wG15 stones.  They will probably live since they have one eye and the bJ11 stones are weak.  But it seems a needless risk.  Black can certainly shut them in (though he doesn't end up doing so, preferring instead an attack that isn't fully thought out).]
;B[so];W[sq];B[gh]TR[gc][gd][hd][ge][ie][ef][gf][if][hg]C[This is the first time I've been worried about these stones.  Maybe I should have been earlier.]
;W[ee];B[de];W[fd];B[gg];W[fg];B[hf];W[ig];B[ff];W[eg]C[Althought it wasn't really hard to get two eyes and I've got a bit of space to expand from .]
(;B[ec]LB[ei:A][gp:B]C[I didn't think this was a good move for black.  I think something like A or B would have caused me more trouble.

dc: I think A limits your group more yes.  And B (or better probably bG3) seems to gain a lot more than even A; the left part of the bottom is the largest undesputed area.

dc: Note also that playing at T8 is a large endgame move.];W[ei]
;B[ej];W[di];B[ci];W[dj];B[dk];W[fj];B[fk];W[gj]C[dc: Let's count here.  You have about 70 points in the upper right.  You will get at least twenty on the bottom.  Black has 50 on the left and 7 in his group in the lower right.  White is way ahead.  White should not be trying to trick Black into losing his bJ11 stones.  White should not be making small pushes from his small group.  White should be limiting Black.  White should be playing for safety and typing up loose ends.  wL15 is really the only move to play here and it will be very hard for White to lose after that.]
;B[hl]
(;W[ik]TR[ij][jk]SQ[ji][ki][kj]C[This seems kind of ugly, but I didn't know why at the time.  In hindsight, I should have known.  I'm making 2 empty triangles pointed right at each other.

dc: wL15 is still the best move.];B[hk];W[hi]C[dc: wL15.  or wL9 is fine here too.  When you have made bad shape you must look on the next move if you can fix it, wL9 would do that very well.  You are still riskily attacking when you have already won.]
;B[kk];W[jj]TR[ik]C[However, now I know why the earlier move looked bad to me.]
;B[kg];W[lf];B[lg];W[mg];B[mh]
(;W[mi]C[I've decided that my big strategic mistake was running instead of starting a killing race here.

dc: No, your strategic mistake is (and has been for many moves) not counting and thinking you even had to take risks to bother capturing these Black stones.  What happens now is a _tactical_ mistake.  Your (overly risky!) strategy has actually worked!  You can now win if you capture the Black stones with wH12 (though see your variations for you still had a (tactical) error in them I believe).]
;B[nh];W[ni];B[ng];W[mf];B[ke];W[ld];B[ql];W[qk];B[oi];W[pi]
;B[kh];W[li]TR[oi]C[Now I'm behind on liberties unlesss I capture the marked stone.  Black can't prevent the capture though.]
(;B[lj];W[oj];B[mj]LB[mk:A]SQ[lj][nj][nk]C[Here is my big tactical mistake.  I was only looking at the group of 4 stones.  If my group is solidly alive, I could capture those stones with a snapback by playing at A.

dc: This is the big mistake.  It is actually very simple.  You haven't been playing perfectly in terms of strategy or tactics, but up to this point you are still definitely winning, definitely _out_-playing your opponent.

dc: It's really just a matter of discipline: you have to be aware of the number of liberties in your groups.  Good players are probably acutely aware at all times of the liberties of every chain with four or fewer liberties.  But don't worry about that.  Just make sure before each stone you place you are aware of which chains are in atari.  If you have to enumerate each chain each turn to check each for a atari, so be it.  You must establish this habit in order to play well consistently.]
(;W[lk];B[oi]C[enmartin [9k\]: oops
heihatsi [10k\]: =)

Unfortunately, my stones were not solidly alive.  Despite my big blunder, I still thought I had a chance to win.]

;W[rc];B[le];W[me];B[kc]C[Wow, I didn't realize I had gotten so weak up here.  I suppose that's what happens after a big mistake though.

dc: These two stones are unimportant!  If White instead plays in the big area around wG3 White will probably still win!]
(;W[kd];B[ma]C[dc: The the shape formed by bP17 and wN18 with the White "dumpling" group is a telltale sign of the "connect-and-die" tactic coming up.

dc: In general, you want to play wO18 instead of wO19 in response to a move like bN19.  When the opponent pushes on the 1st line like that, you usually have more to lose than they do, and forcing them to push again loses only a couple points for you (if it was unnecessary) while giving them less room to maneuver to try to set up a tesuji.  See variation.]
(;W[na];B[qb]
(;W[rb];B[nc]C[heihatsi [9k\]: thx

I resigned when I saw I was going to loose another big group.

dc: My playing style is very much like yours.  I play the opening above my rank, do well at intuitively strategy, and when I focus I can play tactically well -- you would think that pretty much covers the game. But I am bad at forcing myself to count, bad at forcing myself to methodically examine trees of tactical possibilities, and bad at sanity checking my moves.  The good news is that there are no subtle tricks to these "discipline" issues -- you just have to apply yourself and do it.  Whereas it might take years of introspection to get a better feel for intuitive strategy, it's pretty straightforward to decide "I will estimate the score periodically and play more or less riskily based on that estimate."  Or "_Every_move_ in fights I will specifically check for ataris of large groups."]
