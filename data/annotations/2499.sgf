C[<crulx>
Hello. Welcome to my beginners game. I had no rating before this game and a 27k? after. Please give me any advice you have.

I have included some of my thoughts to give you an idea of where white's moves come from.

And a few branches where I thought I went all down a dark path.
</crulx>

<phi>
  I wil try my best.

Crulx [?\]: Greetings. I am new here.];W[dp]C[eriktous [26k?\]: have fun]

C[<phi>
Blacks move is playable. I prefer A(C15). I white follows A by playing B(D15) or C(F18) black has not many possibilites.
</phi>];W[cd]LB[ce:B][de:A][cf:C][df:D]C[<phi>
Your
move is good. Protecting the corner. But it could be a bit more
flexible: Play A (D15) or B(C15) to get more influence and more
territory. Even C(C14) or D(D14) are possible, but this moves are cut
easier.
</phi>];B[id];W[ip];B[lq];W[cj];B[jq];W[iq]C[eriktous [26k?\]: do you play real-life go?
<phi>
Good. You protect black from coming further to the left side.
</phi>];B[ir]C[Crulx [?\]: Occasionally.
Crulx [?\]: I just started getting into it a few months ago]
;W[hr];B[is];W[kp]LB[qj:E][jp:B][hq:A][kq:C][gr:D]C[Crulx [?\]: How long have you played?

<phi>
This
move is a little overplay. Your opponent (black) may cut you into
peaces: A(H3) or B(K4). Sure, you make some pressure on C(L3) but at
this stage of the game it is mor relevant to make influence. I would
protect the cut at A(H3) playing D(G2). Or better ignore the whole
place and go to the right side E(R10) and destroy the whole right
border.
</phi>];B[jp];W[kq]LB[io:A][kp:C][gr:B]C[eriktous [26k?\]: just about two weeks or so in this place

<phi>
I prefer a secure wall. Play A(J5) or B(G2). C(L4) is not very important at the moment.
Black still has the possibility to cut you (see variation).

LB[nn:E][io:B][ko:C][mo:D][hq:A]TR[in][kn][mn][ho][gq][gr]C[<phi>
 Now, you have many cutting points [A(H3), B(J5), C(L5), D(N5) and E(O5)\].
In your position, i would try to protect some of them first, before going further on with your move (P6).
You could protect your stones playing on one of the marked places (triangles).

(;W[jn]C[<crulx>
I think white missed a move here. See branch.
</crulx>
<phi>
 Yes. But you are loosing just about 10 to 15 points. I'd like to see a move now on the right side.
</phi>];B[ko];W[lm]LB[qf:C][qi:A][ql:B]C[<phi>
Let your oponent (black) get some points. Forget about those 10 points. Make a big move in sente (upper hand) on the right side.
I would play A(R11) in your position. 
If black attacks from above, play B(R8); 
if black attacks from below, play C(R14).
In any case, you make easy live on the right side.

</phi>];B[mo];W[ml];B[nn];W[om];B[mm];W[km];B[mn];W[pn]LB[qi:G]
[ll:D][nl:E][jm:C][qn:F][io:B][hq:A]TR[om][on][pn]C[<phi>
The
marked form is known as "the empty trinanlge. It is called empty,
because at Q7 (the center) there is no opponents stone. This is
normally a bad shape. It is only good to make life.
Still you have
to protect some cutting points. Or, if you realy want to play on the
right side. play on F(R5) or somwhere around G(R11).
</phi>];B[qo];W[oe]LB[qc:B][qf:A]TR[qn]C[<phi>
To destroy blacks territory, play somewhere around A(R14) or take the corner with B(R17).
Your move (P15) forces black to respond ("Allways respond to an attachment").
If black reacts, blacks stone gets stronger and blacks corner gets more secure. 
In any way; you sohuld allways react on an attachment (R5 attaches Q6). I would simply play the marked position: R6.
</phi>];B[pe];W[of];B[qg];W[md]C[<phi>
 Goot. This distroys blacks big inflfuence at the top.
</phi>];B[lc];W[ld]LB[mc:A]C[<phi>
Right, you shoud always respond to an attachment. 
Here,
I prefer A(N17), because it separates the two black groups. After a
separations, both groups have to look vor eyes themselves.
</phi>];B[kd];W[ke];B[jd];W[ie]LB[mc:A][je:B][ll:F][nl:G][jm:E]
[io:D][hq:C]C[<phi>
 I still prefer A(N17). After black playing B(K15) you are left with many cutting points again.
</phi>];B[nc];W[gd]LB[mc:A][ef:B][ff:C]C[<phi>
This could be the moment to cut your oponent at A(N17). Your move is not bad, but your move makes the game complicated. 
If
you want to attack the black stone on F16, try to attack from a
distance (at least one free point between: B(E14) or C(F14) are bigger,
because they attack the black stone from a distance and make territory
on the left side as well.
</phi>];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc];W[fe];B[he];W[ge]C[<phi>
This
is not very big. if black takes your two stones, this makes 4 points.
On the other hand, black will then enter your white center territrry.
But black will enter there anyway.
In this case, I prefer a bigger point (probably somewhere at the right side).
</phi>];B[je];W[hf];B[le];W[kf];B[me]LB[jf:A][qi:B][qn:C]C[<crulx>
I think A seems very important for white here.
</crulx>
<phi>
Not
realy. I don't think, that you can protect the whole center against a
black invasion. So let him come in and make some real big points on the
right side around B(R11) and C(R6).
</phi>];W[mf];B[nd]
(;W[pf]C[<phi>
It would be simple now to connect your stones on the right top. See variation.
Your Move (Q14) is sente (upper hand), but not much.

(;W[og]LB[fc:C][ed:B][jf:A][lf:G][cq:D][gq:F][gr:E]C[<crulx>
I failed to realize the importance of A
</crulx>
<phi>
This is true, A is a big point. But you can not have everything. 
You
can not have the left side, the center AND your invasion on the right
side. Try to win with 1 point.Give something to your opponent, but
allways try to make a deal which is a little better.

Here you could try the following:
Let black enter the center and get the upper left corner playing somewhere around B or C.
Or the follwoing:
Let black enter the center and make your left bottom corner secure playing the 3-3 point (D: C3) yourself.
OR try to stabilize your wall playing E(G2) or F(G3).
OR secure the right of A playing G(M14).
</phi>];B[if];W[he]LB[cg:A][lk:C][nk:D][cm:B][ho:E][gr:F]C[<phi>
This is just one point. Black enters your position anyway.
Instead of reacting to this minimal invasion. I would try to protect the borders.
You are ahead, if you have a look at the whole board. But if black enters your territorry, the score will change. 
Whenever you are ahead, play a defensive strategy. When you are behind, attack.
For this reasaon, you reacted right, but your move gives not enough points.

</phi>];B[jf];W[ig];B[jg];W[lf];B[ne]LB[nf:A][hh:B]C[<phi>
If you still want to play in that region, try to get rid of your weak points.
I prefer A(O14) or B(H12).
<phi>];W[jh];B[kh];W[hh]C[<phi>
Good: protect these cutting points.
</phi>];B[ji];W[ih];B[nf];W[mg];B[mh];W[ng];B[nh];W[oh];B[pj]
;W[kg]C[<phi>
It is allways good, to cut your oponent.
In this case I am not sure:
In this special situation, black faces a white wall with many many cutting points. 
See variation.

(;W[do]LB[cn:A][do:B]C[<phi>
Your move is good. But a bit too defensive.
It is normal, that a black stone on the 3-3 point (called san-san) is alive.
So let black live. 
I prefer A(C6) to reduce the damage.
Black will not be able to cut you at B(D5) because the ladder faces a white wall (see variation).
</phi>];B[bn];W[cr];B[br];W[dr]LB[cl:A][dl:B]C[<phi>
This is not necessary. If black enters there, you simply block and you loose about 6 points.
It is more impotant to block your oponent (black) from entering further to the left side.
I prefer A(C8) or B (C9).
Attack and protect from a distance.

Disaster!!! I didn't think through this move.
</crulx>
<phi>
I see the disaster. Playing A(D7) to protect the cutting point lets black enter directly to the center of your territorry.
Anyway, I would play A, to protect the cut and to make a big territorry between the lines D and H

(;W[fm]LB[ei:B][fo:A]TR[el][fm][en]C[<phi>
Black entered your territorry.
You have to protect 3 sides (marked).
The point you choose lets your opponent enter at the bottom AND at the top.
Try to protect large territories from a distance.
I prefer A(F5) and B(E11).

(;W[fj]LB[ci:A]C[<phi>
In my eyes this protects the wrong side.
If you play A(C11), what can black do?

;W[ag];B[ai];W[dg];B[da];W[ca]LB[cb:A]C[<phi>
I would protect this attack with A(C18).
If black palys there, the game gets very complicated. Try to avoid complex games.
See variation.
