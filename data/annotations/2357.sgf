komi 5.5];B[qp]C[RW> Hi, I am Ronald Wopereis from Holland. I will comment your
game. The comment starts with RW> (hope I keep thinking about
that :-)];W[cd];B[pc];W[dp];B[pj];W[pe]C[white attacks early, should i have extended (perhaps to N17)
rather than tried the pincer at Q13?  I lost sente early and
never regained it.

RW> this is not an unusual move for white. And your moves are
fine too. Nothing to be afraid of, so far.];B[pg];W[re];B[rc]
;W[rh];B[rg]C[RW> I'm not sure what you want to do with this move. O16 is an
escape for white, and then your two corner stones are in danger.]
;W[qg];B[qf]C[RW> I don't think it's a good idea to place your stone in a position
like this. Try to move a little away (not so close) like S10.
It is more important that white doesn't escape either through
O16, O14 or S10. Remember, your opponent's best move is probably
yours too.];W[qh];B[pf];W[rf];B[qd]C[RW> Aarrgh. R15 would have given you large advantage.]
;W[qe];B[sd]C[RW> Unneccesary move. White could never get passed T17, because
you would place on T16 and T18 and win the white stone.];W[ph]
;B[oh];W[og];B[of];W[oi];B[ng];W[nh];B[og];W[pi];B[oe]C[RW> good move]
;W[ql]C[RW> try to look at what white is doing, and yet play your own
game (!). In this case, white is trying to connect to his group
of white stones. So your move is to avoid him doing this (but
its impossible I think) or do the same to him on the other side
of the board (E17 is large, M16 is good)];B[pl];W[qj]C[RW> white area now has grown from line 15 up to line 6 (!). You
should not make a wall all along the Q-line, because white has
lines S and T times 19 = 38 points, while you still have no points
at all!];B[pk];W[qk];B[qm];W[op];B[np]C[RW> too close. Make sure you understand why your opponent does
this. It is not to connect to D4 !];W[oo];B[on];W[no];B[po]
;W[nq];B[pp]C[RW> this is good. Let him have this one stone, while you get
an area of 20 points!];W[pq];B[qq];W[pr];B[qr];W[rm];B[qn]C[RW> Q7 is a better move. Do you see why?]
;W[mp];B[ni]C[RW> S5 or S6 and the whole area is yours. Even at this point,
white could do S5 and win 4 points with this one move.];W[nj]
;B[mh];W[oj]C[RW> Q7 gives you one eye, that's why. The other one is S5.]
;B[mj];W[mc]C[I probably should have extended across the top from right to
left long before white played move 56.

RW> yes, i think i meantioned it earlier.];B[nc]C[RW> This is defensive. There is more than half the board waiting
for you to conquer.];W[md];B[me];W[nd];B[od];W[nb];B[oc];W[jc]
;B[nk]C[RW> why would you do this? You can never capture the white group:
T13+14 and S11+10 gives him two eyes.];W[le];B[ne]C[RW> look at the pattern. You move is following his move. This
way you're gonna loose, even when you both are 9th dan.];W[lf]
;B[lg]C[RW> the place to];W[mf]C[RW> This move should have been your move (= two eyes in one move)]
;B[mg];W[cm]C[RW> this move is worth 20 points];B[ml]C[RW> this move is worth 4 points]
;W[ip]C[RW> 15 points move (at least)];B[cc]C[RW> possible six point move (E17 is better, and then H17)]
;W[dc];B[bd];W[cb];B[bc];W[dd];B[bb];W[db];B[ca];W[bf]C[RW> good move for white. After this move, he can play A16 and
kill the black group.];B[be];W[ce];B[af];W[bg]C[RW> not good for white, you get to live.]
;B[ae];W[ag]C[RW> B19 here, then it is either A18 or A17 for white and you
play the other one.];B[da]C[Move 91 was just dumb, I should have played B19 to ensure life.
I think I was thinking of trying to break out at the first line,
but I guess not posible.

RW> yes see comment previous move];W[ba];B[aa];W[ea];B[ac];W[ba]
;B[ca];W[nn];B[ba]C[RW> you live!];W[om]C[RW> this is not good for white. Unless...]
;B[pn];W[jg]C[RW> no. I was saying, unless his next move is P9, you play P8,
he plays at O7 and down you go with white Q7.];B[ki];W[ii];B[jj]
;W[ij];B[ik]C[RW> in these cases, try to push white towards your black wall
by placing stones in line G];W[jk];B[jl];W[hk]C[RW> look at white. He gives you one stone, but builds a wall
to defend seven empty places (= points) . Imagine a triangle
small at H9 and broad at B13 and D4. This is the white area we
are talking about.];B[kk];W[hl];B[im];W[il];B[jk];W[hm];B[in]
;W[hn];B[io];W[ho];B[kn];W[jp];B[kp];W[kq];B[lp];W[lq];B[mo]
;W[lo];B[mn]C[Also probably a dumb move, I sacrificed 2 stones to save one.]
;W[ko]C[RW> don't get upset because of this one stone. Get upset because
the two white walls E19 through A13 and O18 through H5 will crunch
any black stone placed in between.];B[ln];W[nm];B[pm];W[mm]
;B[lm];W[kg];B[kh];W[jh];B[ji];W[cq]C[RW> with this move, white recognizes he will never capture your
black group.];B[eq];W[gq];B[jo];W[jm];B[jn];W[ok];B[nl];W[ol]
;B[rn]C[Move 149 I should have played M8 to connect and prevent the double
atari.];W[rl];B[sm]C[RW> This is a dangerous play, extending when your group does
not live yet.];W[ll];B[km];W[mk];B[lk];W[sl];B[ml];W[nl];B[kl]
;W[sn];B[so];W[sm];B[ro];W[ml];B[mi]C[RW> M11 is better. White can then never play N11 so the point
is yours.];W[ob]C[RW> this move is no use for white. Black group lives already.
I think at this point white is 'overmoedig' I don't know the
english word, too brave to be good for him.];B[pb];W[gc]C[RW> strong move, worth 15 points. G16 would be 20 points. G15
would be 25 points. These walls are STRONG.];B[rd];W[sg]C[RW> this one make the other eye (O9 is an eye)]
;B[pd];W[se];B[oa];W[ma];B[pa];W[dj];B[ps];W[or];B[qs];W[os]
C[Could I have better exploited the unconnected stones at M16,
L14, J12 etc., or was this entirely poinless?

RW> it's no use. I think it's time for black to pass here. Really
it's all white area now.];B[ld]C[RW> your only chance is to attack at two places in one move.]
;W[lc];B[kd];W[kc];B[jd];W[ie];B[id];W[je];B[ic];W[ib];B[lb]
;W[mb];B[jb]C[RW> I count three liberties for white, and three for black. Now
if it is white's turn, and it is, he wins.];W[kb];B[ja];W[ka]
;B[ia]C[Moves 191 to 197, could I have killed whites group in the upper
right?];W[hb]C[RW> H19 would capture your threesome. But this move does the
same, essentially. You see?];B[na];W[ha];B[ke];W[kf];B[bi];W[ci]
;B[bl];W[bj];B[ck];W[cj];B[aj]C[RW> B11 will give you no points & no eyes. It's to be considered
lost. Also, playing on the A line will make you weak.];W[ak]
;B[bk];W[ai];B[bm];W[bn];B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[bo];B[dl]C[RW> good move.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[en];B[el];W[fj];B[eo];W[fn];B[gn];W[go];B[gm]
;W[fo];B[do];W[ep];B[fp];W[fq];B[dq];W[cp];B[dk]C[RW> good move]
;W[ej];B[nf]C[RW> never give up once you started the fight, until it's over.]
;W[ih];B[mr];W[mq]C[RW> white should pass here.];B[tt];W[da]
;B[tt];W[gl];C[white wins by an extremely large margin.

RW> I hope you understand why. Essentially, white is too strong
for you. I think 5 kyu stronger (you 30 kyu, white 25 kyu).

Thank you for letting me comment.])
