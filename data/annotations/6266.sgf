C[CW [?\]: hi thx

In this game black emphasized territory too much and gave white too much thickness.  White's thickness was worth far more than the territory.

Black was already behind at move 90, and after that fight, he was far behind.]
;B[qd];W[cp]C[sinprejic [3k\]: hi :)];B[dd];W[pp];B[kd]
(;W[dj]LB[cf:A][eq:B][pg:C]C[When white plays on the left, he usually goes all the way to A.  Normally you don't want to extend from a 3-4 point until after you enclose the corner, so B is also playable.  The other option is to extend down the right side to C.]
;B[pj]C[I rarely loose when I get the classic chineese shape...]
;W[qn];B[jq]C[It's usually better to approach the 3-4 corner than to play in the center.  White still needs another move to enclose the lower right.]
;W[oq]
(;B[cg]C[This is not good.  Now that white is strong in the lower right, you need to strengthen your stone at the bottom.  You don't want white to enclose the lwoer left with sente, and make you extend toward white's strength.

Your move doesn;t put much pressure on the white stone, and doesn't enclose the upper left either.  If you have to play near here, I would extend one line further to put more pressure on white.

I would approach the white corner as in the variation.];W[pg]
LB[od:A]C[The joseki is to come in at A.  This move lets black enclose the corner and leaves the white stone weak.]
;B[od]C[Good];W[md]C[As soon as my opponent did this I felt very good about my prosepcts. 4 against 2, strong group in the middle.

I agree.  White's last two moves are poor.  You have two weak stones of your own, on the right side and lower side, so you wil want to end with sente to settle one of them.]
;B[ne];W[ic]
(;B[kc]LB[je:A]C[If you play at A instead, white is still separated, but your upper group is more connected to the center, which should be better for the running fight to come.]
;W[le];B[ng];W[lg];B[oh]C[ok so I get one good enough

I would not be so happy with this result.  Your upper side group will be attacked now, and the territory you just made is small, and the white stone still has aji.  In the end you make about 15 points here, but white makes points on the lower right to compensate, and makes thickness, so the result is not good since black started with a big advantage in this corner.]
;W[je];B[mc];W[nc];B[nd];W[lc];B[mb];W[pc];B[qc];W[pd];B[pe]
;W[nb];B[ld];W[me];B[lb];W[oc];B[nf]C[this whole fight was a good reading exerise, but I can't say I saw all of this from the very start when I played p12.  I had the sense that if he played o18 his stones would just be too weak, and die inside.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[qj];B[qh];W[pk];B[oj]C[and they do but he gets more on the outside than originally anticipated.]
;W[rh]C[I had read out that this was gote, so it surprised me that he played it.]
;B[qi];W[qe];B[re];W[ri];B[rj];W[qk];B[rg];W[rk];B[sh];W[sj]
LB[if:A]C[I suspect maybe he should have taken sente here. 2 stones just aren't big enough.

Yes.  A move at A would connect his weak stones.];B[ke];W[kf]
;B[jf];W[jg];B[if];W[ie];B[id]C[I felt quite proud of this one :) secure m18 and get some territory at the same time]
;W[hf];B[hd];W[ok]C[very small.];B[mq]C[I suspect that this was the wrong direction. I was thinking that I wanted to oppose his growint thickness up top.

Yes, wrong direction.  You need to approach the lower left corner. Play near the weaker stones.]
;W[nj]C[So this is the first move I didn't see comming.

This is why he made his previous odd-looking move, to try to trick you here.]

(;B[oi];W[fc]
(;B[hc]C[This is too small.  You spent 3 moves to capture one stone here while white gets strong on the outside.

Better to surround the f17 stone.  Even if it lives you will get a corner and some thickness in sente.]
;W[fe]C[This way you kill a small stone, and white escapes with the other stone, and your corner is open.]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[mg];W[lf];B[lh];W[ig]C[This forcing sequence gained very little.  You gave up the option of using a ladder breaker later.]
;B[dc]C[So you get the corner in gote instead of sente.];W[hq]
C[Good attack.  white is very strong here, so you need to answer this move.]

(;B[ge];W[ef];B[df];W[gd]
(;B[gc]C[I shouldn't have done this];W[fd];B[ib]C[Is this move necessary?

The upper side is a big success for white.  Black spent several moves capturing a single stone while white got thick on the outsdide and broke into the side.

Even though black has more secure territory it feels like white is ahead.]

(;W[eh]C[sinprejic [3k\]: not sure what I should do here
CW [2k?\]: 4h good point
sinprejic [3k\]: it seems like I should be able to do something against th corner, but what I did sure didn't work


My oponent probably should have played h5 I got lucky

White's move is thick.  Secure territory is close, and white is much thicker, so white is ahead.]

(;B[eq]C[Black has a weak group on the lower side.  It's dangerous to create another one.

Black has more solid territory, but white is thick.  White can catch up if he has a target to attack, so black should not give him one.

When you are ahead on territory, but behind on thickness, you should try to get thicker, not make more territory.

The fight that starts with this move leaves black well behind.]
;W[ep]
(;B[fp];W[fq]C[I didn't expect the cut. I don't know why, but I just assumed he would extend e5. So now I get myself in lots of trouble.

This is a standard cut in this shape.]
(;B[dp];W[eo]
(;B[do]C[This move is no good since white can cut.];W[dq]
(;B[cq]C[You can't let white capture the E3 stone and get a ponnuki here. It makes him too strong.  If he is strong on both sides your k3 and n3 stones will suffer.

You must pull out once.];W[er];B[bp];W[co];B[dn];W[cn];B[bo]
;W[cr];B[cm];W[bn];B[bm];W[bq]C[This is a disaster for black.  White gets a big corner and thickness. The block strones on the lower side are in great danger with thick white groups on either side.  The black stones on the left are short on liberties and eye space.]

;B[nr]
(;W[mo]C[white might be able to kill you here, but he doesn't have to. He is ahead, and can take more territory with sente, then attack your other weak group.

When you are ahead, don't start fights.  Simplify the game and secure the victory.]
