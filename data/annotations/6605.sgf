C[Hi!

First of all thanks fo review my game!
It was a game on dragon go server who was play in one week.]

(;B[jc]LB[ke:A]C[Is this move right? or is better to make a shimari in the upper left corner?

this move is possible only in some situations, that is when the corner stones are very strong already. Now they are not. White can split black possition eficiently by A in a good shape and black has more trouble than white. 

Tenuki would be bad here.];W[de]C[And either is for white, the L15  is very important]

(;B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[dg]
(;B[fc]C[Too low - bad possition to the low k17.];W[cn]C[White should not play this move, its dangerous.]

(;B[ch];W[bg]C[This black stone is weak]
(;B[cl]C[You should attack white harder];W[cj];B[dj];W[ci];B[di]
;W[bh];B[ck]C[This result is very good for white. The black stones have a bad cut, so B doesn't have time to attack anymore.]
;W[en];B[bj]C[Why do you play this? There is no advantage in it. But you lost a possibility to play B9 in sente.]
;W[bi];B[dm]C[Usually its not good to peep like this, e8 is a good shape. But it might be possible here.]
;W[dn];B[bo];W[fq]C[White can't afford to play this aggresively.]
;B[fp]C[right];W[gp]
(;B[eq]C[bad bad bad. You have to split your oponents groups!]
;W[fo];B[ep];W[gn]C[Now W is save and connected, you are closed inside]
;B[po]C[Looks like the best point now. Because of the low move at F17 it would be difficult to develop the top side.]
;W[np];B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[or];B[qk]C[The white joseki isn't good for making a territory, but it looks possible.]
;W[hc]C[From here, i see i have a very big move in f2, but just con know whne it would be the right timing to play it. I don't want to play it too fast, before i want to let me the possibility of inading the bottom if i was behind later....

Firstly - G3 is much better. Its so large that white might want to play F2 very soon, so you can play it imediately. 
White is very strong there, so its not likely you would want to invade, reduction is suitable. So you can for example try some testing move outside and than take the F3 stone.

This white move is really bad. What does it do? Take away 10 points from black? Looks more like a sacrifice to me.]

(;B[je];W[kc]
(;B[kd]C[A bad move. Only helps white.];W[ke];B[jd];W[le]

(;B[gd];W[pc];B[pb];W[qb];B[pd];W[qc];B[mf]C[Yep, bad gote from white. But this move of yours is also bad, you only help white to make shape.]

(;W[jf];B[if];W[jb];B[ib];W[ic]C[The white plan doesn't work, so its not good.]

;W[md]
(;B[kp]C[Yep, it needs a move. Moreover this move is bad from several reasons. First - its too deep. Risk is the last thing you need now when you are ahead. Second - the white top group is almost dead (if we forgot your is actually) and you should attack it. Even if it lives, the invasion will come by itself.]

Congratulations to your victory :)

White played the game carelessly, 1d should do better. Sometimes it looks like a 10s blitz game from him.]
