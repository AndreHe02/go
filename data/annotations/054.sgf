opening.  A good start];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp]L[qq][pr][mo][lp][kn]
C[This is a very effective strategy for white.  By not sliding into
the corner (by playing b) the shape is still unsettled and is aiming at
invading at a should black invade  the wide extension

 Should black invade white's extension then white gets thickness which will
allow him to invade at a  profitable.

If black wants a large moyo (which is the point of the sanren-sei) he
should probably play c.

Followed by white d, and black e];B[jd];W[fc]L[mo][lp][kn]C[Now is an excellent time for black to continue building his moyo by
playing a, followed by  white b, then black c];B[cn]L[mo]C[This is the wrong direction.  There is no need for black to be
reducing white.  Black has made  good moves all around.  9 dan moves in fact.  White has already lost ground
by playing f17, this is very  small compared to a.];W[cl];B[cq];W[dq];B

might have missed that this is  the wrong way to play.]N[Not Joseki - Actual play]

(;W[en]L[co]N[White's mistake]C[This is an overplay by white.
Joseki has him playing a

Black should connect at a and will be in very good shape!];B[dl]C[Another mistake, allowing white to get back on track.]
;W[co];B[bo]L[bm][bp]C[White plays a but should have played b as in variation B]

[dr]C[In the end this turned out quite well for black.  A live group.];B
[em];W[fn];B[ci]L[mo]C[This is a small move.  Black is ahead, and should now play safely and
seal off his territory.

a is still the best point.];W[ql]C[This is a terrible move by white.  Black should chase that white
stone right out into the middle.]
(;B[pl]N[Actual play];W[pm]C[This cut is aweful.  Black should capture the side still chase the
stones into the middle.]
(;B[om]L[qm]N[Actual play]C[Atari underneath would be better.  White would be dead on the side
and with out a base.  Black  could chase the stone all over the board.]
;W[qm];B[qn];W[pk];B[ol];W[qk];B[pr]L[qj]C[The moyo being destroyed on the top is more important than the
corner.

Protecting the top side by going a would be a better idea.];W[qq]C[Bad play by white.]
;B[pq];W[ok];B[no]C[Play is now about line 9, this reduction of whites moyo is a bit late
now, and the cut at p6 is un  important after whites r8 stones run out into the middle and crawlin into
what once was blacks moyo.    The idea behind a sanren-sie have not be followed at all.]
;W[np];B[mo];W[qf]
(;B[qe]N[Wrong joseki, actual play]C[Not a wise choice for joseki in this corner.  White ends up getting
all the territory on the side.];W[pf];B[nd];W[qi];AB[oj]L[cf]C[This is wasted.  Black is only going to make white stronger by this
move.  Extending up the  side attacking the last corner is a better idea.

Then Blacks moyo on the side would compare with Whites on the bottom.  Black
having 3 corners and  white 1, black should win.];W[nk];B[mm]L[cf][nf]
C[This does nothing.  I don't know what the point of this move is.

When I pick points to play.  I evaluate what is at risk of dying.

Currently black has nothing.  Next I ask What of Whites is at risk of dying.
 Currently nothing.

Then were are territory claiming points to take?  What are the bigest ones.

N7 is none of these.  The biggest points are marked.];W[lc]
(;B[nf]L[qc][mc]N[Actual play: Black ignores]C[White invades blacks territory and black ignored it!?

The white stones on the side are alive no matter what black does.

This isn't the best point for white to play either.  a is.

Black should have played b];W[qc]C[Now the invasion comes.]

game.  By letting white cut it off  from the rest of the game, blacks influence is severly curbed.]
;B[rf];W[od];B[qd]C[This is a wasted move, as good as passing.  What threat did black
see?

There is no way for white to live in the corner and black is connected.]
;W[ne];B[md];W[mc];B[ld];W[kd];B[ke];W[kc];B[me]L[le][lf]C[A solid connection at a is best.

what black played.];W[mf];B[le];W[jc]

life in the middle and it claims  no territory.];W[ng];B[nh]C[The connection between q12 and the three stones on the 14th row is
very tough to break.  This  is pointless for black!];W[mf];B[pg]C[Big mistake
This sequence of moves cost black the game.  He was winning till now.];W
