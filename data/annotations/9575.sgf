C[Hi,

I'm Wonodan from KGS.

I'll start my comments with W.];B[pd]C[mazoula [10k\]: This game urks me because my opponent made a lot of invasions into my territory and I would like to handle the invasions better or build more invasion resistant territory

W: Remember that even if you have multiple stones in an area, it does not always mean it is your territory. Just that it's more likely to become your territory.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[ed]C[mazoula [10k\]: I decided on san ren sei here, but what are the josekis and tradeoffs for approaching the 5-4 point

W: There aren't really moves that are better or worse, if E16 was somehow better then every professional player would start their game by playing 2 of them, wouldn't they? :-)

White is telling you to invade his top left corner to exchange the points in the corner for outside influence.]

(;B[pj]LB[jd:A][jp:B]C[W: There's nothing wrong with the san-ren-sei. Usually you want to continue by playing at A or B from this position. Since White's top left corner stone is closer to A than bottom left stone is to B, I'd say B looks more correct.]
;W[dh];B[df]LB[jp:A]C[mazoula [10k\]: I tried invading at the weak point

W: This invasion is too early. It is better to play for example at A.

Usually in order to invade you need to have friendly stones nearby. Jumping in like this is a 1 on 2 fight which favors White. Since it's White's turn to play next, it's almost like a 1 on 3 situation!]

(;W[he];B[dd];W[dc]C[mazoula [10k\]: i'm not sure my opponent handled this correctly or if I played this invasion out correctly

W: Your opponent did not use the 2 on 1 situation to his advantage, your touch at D16 was perfect. When in trouble, touching is usually the best option.]
;B[cd];W[cc]
(;B[cg];W[bc];B[ch];W[ci];B[bi];W[cj];B[bj];W[ck]C[W: Whatever happens, never get closed in. It is White who has gained in this exchange. White has a huge corner and nice influence on the outside while Black got a few points on the edge, and his group is not yet settled.]
;B[jd]LB[jp:A]C[mazoula [10k\]: getting a double wing

W: Good. I'd rather build it at A though, since White's stones would be furher away. (you'd get more out of your framework/moyo/potential)]
;W[bk];B[hc]C[mazoula [10k\]: not sure if this move is big enough compared to an approach to d4 or a big point or securing the double wing

W: I like your idea of continuing from K16 to H17. K16 threatens H17, and it would seem odd not to continue this way.]
;W[gd]
(;B[md]
(;W[gb];B[gc];W[fc];B[hb];W[fb]LB[qc:B][jp:A]C[W: This is very small, White should have not connected and played elsewhere, such as A or B.]
;B[qc]LB[qd:A][qe:B]TR[jd][pd][pj]C[mazoula [10k\]: again I'm not sure if this is a big enough move.  Perhaps q13, k4, tengen

W: The idea behind this move is strategically correct. This is a huge, good solid move.

When either side makes a doublewing such as the marked stones, the opponent will always invade the corner immediately, because it'd be too big to allow one side to build such a big territory.

Normally R17 is played at A or B, and White still can't live in the corner by invading. By playing at R17 you leave more space for White to invade on both the upper and right sides.]
;W[ld]C[mazoula [10k\]: I guess this is a sabaki style invasion aimed at isolating my h17 group.  What is the best way to handle this.

W: This looks like an overplay to me, which should not succeed. You are correct that White is trying to split your groups, but your stones are too strong in this area for White to succeed.]
;B[lc]LB[le:A]C[W: Correct first move. You could even consider the hane from the other side at A.]
;W[mc]LB[kc:A][nd:B]C[W: When cross-cut, don't atari but extend! Consider playing A or B.]

(;B[nc]C[W: Playing an atari when you can not capture is usually not a good idea.]
;W[kc]
(;B[kd]C[mazoula [10k\]: i try trapping the white stones but I couldn't find a way to make this work.]
;W[lb];B[le];W[lc]
(;B[nd]C[mazoula [10k\]: k17 is urgent to remove eye space as far as I can tell.  But I couldn't find a way to make even k17 work

W: In my opinion the vital point would've been O18 instead of K17. (See variation)]
;W[jc];B[id];W[ib]LB[jj:B][jp:A]C[W: The White group is alive. It's best to focus on elsewhere. For example A or B which both would be consistent with your current moyo strategy.]
;B[ia];W[ja];B[ha];W[nb];B[ob];W[ma];B[jb];W[kb];B[ic];W[jb]
;B[jp]C[mazoula [10k\]: how and when do I protect the L16 group?

W: The L16 group is safe. You'll see it in a variation later.]
;W[aj];B[ah];W[af];B[bf]LB[bf:B][ah:A]C[W: I really liked your answers at A and B.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[ad];B[ce];W[ae];B[ag];W[ac];B[dg];W[de];B[ee]
;W[fe]LB[jj:B][np:A]C[W: Your group on the left is alive, so don't waste any moves there anymore.

A and B would make great candidate moves.];B[ff];W[gf];B[fg]
;W[eh]
(;B[dn]LB[cq:B][fq:A]C[mazoula [10k\]: is the d6 invasion correct?  What is the best play here?

W: This is the second time in this game where you invade your opponent's strong area. This will only cause trouble.

It's better to approach from A or invade B directly.]
(;W[cn];B[dm];W[cm];B[do];W[co];B[ep];W[dq];B[eq];W[dr]C[W: Well I must admit that you got yourself a nice wall, but White also got a huge corner.]
;B[er]LB[jj:B][np:A]C[W: 2nd and 1st line moves are best left for the endgame stage of the game.

A or B instead would've been a good followup from your wall.]
;W[lf]C[mazoula [10k\]: white finally gets around to attacking the L15 group]

(;B[kf]C[W: L14 left behind a weakness.];W[me];B[ke];W[mf]
(;B[kg];W[mi]
(;B[pg]C[mazoula [10k\]: It looks to me like extending the L13 group is more urgent than making territory here.

W: If it was more urgent why not play there in the game? :-)]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[oi]C[W: What does this move really threaten? Why do you answer this move? (See variation)]

(;B[pi];W[of];B[pf];W[oe]
(;B[ng];W[og];B[lg]C[mazoula [10k\]: m13 is just a bad move.

W: Should get out instead.];W[ki];B[ih]C[mazoula [10k\]: I thought I could connect to the f13 group or extend into the center but apparently I'm too late.]
;W[hh];B[hg];W[ig]
(;B[gh];W[jh];B[ii];W[if];B[ji]C[mazoula [10k\]: I'm giving up on my l13 group and trying to create a large moyo on the bottom right by threatening to save the L13 group.

W: Very good plan. Black has good moyo prospects.];W[kh]
(;B[nj];W[mh]C[W: If you truly believe your top group is dead, and you intend to sacrifice it...]
;B[mg]C[W: ...then don' t add any moves to it.];W[jg]
(;B[ni];W[nh];B[mj];W[kj]C[W: White got the keypoint of this position.]
;B[lj];W[hf];B[hi];W[kk]
(;B[lk]C[W: This is a slow move.];W[kl];B[ll];W[qm]C[mazoula [10k\]: the r7 invasion is big.  I think I should have played the move myself to make territory but when?

W: When you have an enormous moyo, you must understand it will never become your territory completely. Your opponent will invade, but you try to make his life as small as possible while making as many points as possible.]

(;B[om]C[mazoula [10k\]: what is the best way to handle the r7 invasion?

W: You are attacking from the wrong direction. This might be nice in case you were building an ENORMOUS moyo in the center. In this case it is not effective.

This move does not make any points for Black.];W[rj]
(;B[qk];W[rk];B[ri];W[qo];B[qp];W[ql];B[po];W[ro];B[rp];W[qj]

(;B[qi];W[pk]C[W: Letting White capture here made his group completely safe.]
;B[ok];W[pl];B[ol];W[oj];B[km];W[jm];B[kn];W[mq]C[mazoula [10k\]: How do I handle the n3 invasion.  The territory I'm getting after the r7 and n3 invasions isn't worth it.  When should I have secured my territory?

W: I don't think the invasions were the problem, it was your mindset of how to answer the invasions.

When answering an invasion, try to find the move that attacks your opponent while you get as many points as possible.]

(;B[nq]C[W: Touching  helps the one touched. When attacking, don't touch.]
;W[nr]C[W: When White got this hane on the second line, his group was almost immediately alive!]

;B[ps];W[pe];B[qe];W[si];B[sh];W[sj];B[rg];W[oa];B[pa]C[W: Normally this would be a severe mistake, but since White's group is also in danger White does not dare to cut.]

[fs][gs][qs][rs][ss]C[W: I hope you enjoyed the review, it was a fun game to review. :-)

Main things to remember based on this game:

Don't invade unless you have friendly stones nearby. (Moves 7, 75)

Don't get surrounded EVER. (Move 13, 103, 109)

Move quicker than your opponent. (Moves 91, 93, 101, 127)

Don't play atari unless you capture. Extending is better in most of the cases. (Move 35)

Attack from the direction that gives you the most points. (Moves 131, 153)

Take advantage of your opponents mistakes. (Move 192)])
