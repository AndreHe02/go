C[In this game I'm playing white. I will be very appreciative if someone can give me some tips and show me my mistake in the game. In advance, thanks for all the work you put in this

M/  Hi, I'm Mishuu, 3k on KGS. I'm sure we can find points to help improve your game.]
;B[ed];W[dq]C[From the start i was trying to take the territory on the sides

M/  Don't worry this move is normal.];B[cc];W[qp];B[oq]C[I dont really know what to do now take the third corner or defend this one

M/  On this side, you have 2 white stones against a single black stone, and it's your turn. Try to take care of this advantage and attack black. See the variations.]

(;W[qn]C[i decide too defend dont know is this a good defend

M/  This is a slow but solid move.];B[qk]
(;W[pd]C[M/  This move is OK but it's not too late to pincer the black stone at the bottom. See var.]
;B[nc];W[qf];B[pb]
(;W[dj]LB[ok:B][kq:A]SQ[qk][oq]C[M/  This move is not urgent. There are still two black stones to attack. See var.]

;W[rg];B[rh]
(;W[rl]C[M/   To still black's eyespace is not bad but there is better. Your white group on the top is weak and before attacking the black stones you have to be correctly settled. See var.]
;B[md];W[of];B[oh];W[mf]C[M/  Good.];B[nf];W[ne];B[ng];W[me]
;B[pg];W[pf];B[qg];W[sf];B[og];W[cn]LB[nn:A][kq:B]C[M/ Once again, it's not too late to split the two black groups. A move like A or B would be much better : it is bigger (territory) and it weakens black. I have the feeling that you defend too much, try to attack more (and think of course :p). By attacking correctly you will gain influence or territory ;)]
;B[dl];W[cf]C[M/  Good move.];B[ch];W[ef];B[df];W[dg];B[de]

(;W[cl]TR[cf][ef][cg][dg][bh][dh][ci][dj][cn][dq]C[M/  This is too submissive ! With the last moves, you gain a nice and strong shape. You have to attack black once again. See var.]

;W[gp];B[jq];W[mq]SQ[nf][ng][og][pg][qg][oh][qh][rh][ej][gj]
[qk][dl][el][em][jq][oq]C[M/  Finally ! This is a good move. To my mind, every marked stones are not secure. Black won't be able to save everythinf. You are making the game hard for black.]

;B[ld]C[M/   OK :)   At this point you are leading by a comfortable margin, and you were better than black. Therefore, remember than always defending is not enough : when your opponent is weak, single, attack him without hesitation. If you play correctly (I mean, don't think about killing), you will gain what you intend to (territory or at least influence). Think about the capping play too. 
But you showed that you could take the initiative when you have to reduce your opponent's territory and it's nice.

If you have any question contact me on mail or KGS.
Best,
Mishuu])
