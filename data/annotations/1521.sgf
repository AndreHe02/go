;B[pq]C[HiI.  Thanks for reviewing my game;  I played White.  The time limit was a little fast (7 minute/25 stones byo yomi), but I'm weak enough that it didn't really make much difference, and I've noted the places where I think I played too fast.

I've asked questions in various places through the game, and added variations in a couple of spots to illustrate what I was thinking.  Of course, feel free to comment anywhere else you want to--I'm sure I missed the biggest problems.

-Ed];W[pe];B[ec];W[po]C[In general it is better to play in an empty corner before playing on the side.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[ql]C[Could I leave the joseki unfinsihed and take the lower left corner?

I wouldn't.  Leaving weak groups like this behind is usually a bad idea.  If you wanted to play in the lower left, you shouldn't make the approach move.]
;B[dp];W[pc]LB[jd:a][md:b]C[I'm beginning to think that this was a bad idea.Maybe I should have played on the upper side first?  If so, should it be around 'a' (K16), or around 'b' (N16)?

My thinking is that 'b' continues to emphasize the right side, so that might be better.  The idea of 'a' is to blunt the influence at the top that Black will get after White enters the upper right corner later.

I like A better than the game move.  With all your stoned on the right side, black is developing much faster than you are.]
;B[kd]
(;W[cc]C[Perhaps White should play around c10 instead?  Black gets awfully strong at the top after this.

Or would it be worthwhile to play N16 and then invade the corner if black extends to H16?  Then after the joseki sequence in the corner, Black might be over concentrated.

I would probably play C15 or C16 rather than C17.  It looks to me like breaking up the left side is bigger than the corner.]
;B[de]
(;W[be]C[Joseki is C15, but that gives Black a very good result here, doesn't it?

Your move gives black just as good a result if not better.  The B13 stone extends the moyo at the bottom as well as enclosing your corner.]
;B[cg];W[iq]C[I felt White had to invade already, and this looked like the best spot.

This is OK, but it isn't that urgent.  There isn't any one place that black can play that turnes his moyo into territory.]

(;B[kq]C[Is this the correct side for Black to press on?

I would play on the other size, pushing you toward my strength.]
;W[fq];B[er]C[I don't normally play this type of move.  As white, I might just play C6 and give up the F3 stone if black wants it.]

(;W[fr];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[md];B[jo];W[io]C[I felt this group needed some attention.  Is this the right thing to do?]
;B[in];W[hn];B[jn];W[hm]C[Is K4 better?  I wanted to get the group into the center.

getting out into the center is more important, You may live if you play K4, but you will be eclosed and black will have a huge moyo in the center.]
;B[qi];W[qg];B[oi]
(;W[og]C[THis is the wrong direction.  You territory in the upper right is secure, and this move doesn't help you much.  P8 strengthens the right side group and continues the attack.]
;B[mi];W[mg]C[I was happy because I have secured the UR, and the Black group is still unsettled.

How much actual territory did you get from the last 2 moves.  It looks like about 5-6 points to me.  You already had most of the upper right corner.  These two moves didn't make it much bigger.  The P13 stone is pretty much wasted.]
;B[om];W[pm];B[ol];W[ic]C[Would a reduction on the left be better?

I thought I could link up, but I didn't manage it.  Was I wrong, or did I misplay later?

This doesn't look so good to me.   It looks like you will end up with two weak groups. Black should be able to make profit attacking.]

(;B[bn]C[Was this necessary?

It is an endgame move.   There are bigger points to play.];W[gn]
;B[gk];W[fj]
(;B[hj]C[I thought I was doing OK here, and that I just needed to reduce Black's center or upper side.  I didn't manage it very well.

Is the left center really alive??];W[fh]
(;B[il]C[Should I have played here instead of my last move?

A white play here is small.  Black should protect the top rather than the center]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[gf];B[id];W[hd]LB[gd:a]C[Is this an overplay?  Is 'a' better?]

;W[rl];B[rh]
(;W[rg]C[I wonder if a play in the UL would have been bigger than this?

Probably.  You should try to avoid responding to moves like this if there is another move that is just as big.]
;B[cb];W[db]C[This is just a tactical blindspot, but I think I lose anyway if I submit in the corner.

Would it have helped to tenuki and play in the lower right?]
;B[dc];W[cd]C[Does B17 work?  I t seems to, and if so it's a lot better than this.  Again, I was too timid.]

(;W[rr]C[Is O5 bigger?  My variations are likely wrong, but if O5 keeps sente, White could play both that and this, and that seems strong for White.

Yes, O5 would reduce black more.];B[rs];W[sq]C[In fact, O5 now would still be strong, right?

Right.];B[ka];W[mc];B[sg];W[sf];B[sh];W[re];B[on]C[Now it looks like White has lost the chance to break into the center.]
;W[rj]C[This doesn't work so well.

This is too small, only about 5 points.];B[qk];W[sk];B[pn];W[qn]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[qj];W[ji]C[I thought I was losing by about 10 points here, and so I tried to reduce the center territory.  I didn't succeed.  Was it the right idea, and how could I have played it better?

This isn't too bad.];B[ih];W[jh];B[jg];W[ig];B[ii]
