AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[G: Hi Benjamin - 

First of all - handicap games are usually not so good review candidates, the fixed opening for black gives little room for showing strenght or weakness. Also, white often overplays a lot and black often just ends up defending the corner stones till it's over. That being said - this game is still fun to review though! 

I think your biggest mistake is playing to high - i.e. to far from the edges. As I am sure you have seen/heard the center is much smaller than the edges. [1\] On such a high handicap you can force white into the center, the corners+a bit of extension on each side is yours and you win easily, at least in theory :) 

I will prefix my comments by G. Enjoy the review!

MK: Greetings to my reviewer. My name is Benjamin, and I play on KGS as MiyazawaK with a rank of 12k. I've only been playing seriously for two months or so, so a lot of my losses are due to simple reading errors and tactical mistakes that are immediately obvious. I felt like I made a lot fewer obvious errors in play this time, so I though this game would make a good review candidate.

I've commented the game myself to the best of my abilities, so that you can have a good idea of my understanding of the game and correct where I may have misunderstood a situation. Thanks so much for taking your time to help!]
;W[jc];B[qj]C[MK: I'd never seen this opening before. In retrospect I think that playing the same move on the bottom side might have been better.

G: White's opening against 4H stones can be almost anything, this answer is as good as anything I reckon.]
;W[fq];B[cn]TR[hq][iq][jq]C[Now, it's hard to say that this is wrong, but I would always use the handicap stones for attack, so I would always play a pincer here...]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[MK: I think this was probably a mistake. I wanted to divide his two stones, but I ultimately end up losing the dividing stone anyhow.

G: This reflects your relative skill levels, this stone shouldn't be lost :) To me this move is ok.]
;W[jq];B[np]LB[hq:A]TR[lo]C[G: I prefer triangle - this would allow you to invade his 3 point extension later at A]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[G: This I think is wrong ... I would block the other way and build strength to attack his center.]
;W[pq]
(;B[mq]LB[hq:B][or:A]TR[lr]C[MK: It didn't occur to me until I went back through the game that this move was a mistake -- if I had played N4 I think I could have kept some pressure on the bottom right group instead of losing them to the ladder-breaker.

G: Yes - this is not so nice. N4 is possible, but feels a bit small, how about M2 aiming at either p2 or h3 later? Or a move at the top.]
;W[nr];B[hc];W[cf];B[df]TR[ce]C[MK: I'm trying to learn when I should make plays for territory and when I should make plays for influence. My intent here was to trade a bit of the corner for influence in the middle, but I have no idea if it was a good idea.

G: This I dont like - you have so many ways into the center, this is worthless for influence. C15is much nicer, strengthens your corner after the long "extension" to H17 and secures some territory.]
;W[dg];B[ef]TR[ce]C[G: Again, I would play for territory, play C15!]
;W[ce]
(;B[cd]C[MK: Should I have played this at D15 to prevent the cut that comes later?

G: No - I think this is correct. The cut later is not so bad.]
;W[ch];B[eg];W[eh];B[lc];W[de]
(;B[ee]TR[df][ef][eg]C[G: I dont like this - the 3 stones were not very useful, and do not deserver this much effort to save them, instead, build strenght against the lone stone at k17 and let him have these. See variation.]
;W[ed]C[MK: This was bad for me.];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[gd]
(;B[gf]C[MK: This is one of my obvious tactical mistakes -- I didn't recognize that this group was unrescuable until i'd wasted a few stones on it.

G: it would be rescuable still, it can run into the center, where it could connect to a number of your other groups. BUT at terrible cost :) 

Instead, you can gain a lot by threatening white's cutting stones and giving up the ugly lump of stones at e14.]
;W[fh]TR[ge][gg]C[G: this sets up the crane's nest tesuji [1\] - black has to move at one of the triangled spaces if he wants to save the stones.

;W[gg];B[hg];W[gh];B[ge];W[fe];B[je]C[G: I see that you want to attack K17, but it is already very weak. Attach from a distance, this is too close.]
;W[mp]C[G: This is unfortunate, now all of white's side is one group. BUT this was probably not the largest move on the board at the moment. Make white pay by taking some profit now! See variations.]

(;B[mo];W[lp];B[lo];W[kp];B[nn]C[MK: P4 would have worked better -- I really don't know what I thought I was doing with this move.

G: These things happen :) But note later that this is where you later let him into the center - in fact, this is "the game losing move" :)]
;W[op];B[oo];W[oq]C[G: I feel this is a bit weak of white. Do not fear the KO!]
;B[hn]TR[qc][cj][nj][bk][ck][dk][eq][dr][er]C[MK: I'm not sure at all whether this was a good move. My intent was to offer two threats -- either I connect this stone to my thick group on the right and get a lot of strength in the middle or I connect to the left and give support to my weak stones.

G: I am sorry, but this does nothing. Any triangled move is better.
The game is very quite just here. No weak groups=no real action. Grab some territory and assume your extra stones means you will come out with more.]
;W[jn]C[G: this is also a weak reply, the good black moves from last time still stand.]
;B[fo];W[dl]
(;B[hq]TR[bk][bl][cl]C[MK: Is this too agressive? At the time I felt that I had a good chance to kill the F3 stone and secure a big corner.

GAG: I think this is move is good, but the timing is off. Earlier I would have liked it a lot. 
Locally, I think pushing from your corner, threatening this move is much bigger (variation) - but really I think D8 is too high and you should creep under.]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[gq]
(;B[ip]C[MK: This was a mistake, I think; if I had played H2 and let white have the stone at H4 I might have been able to kill the two inside stones.

G: I dont like H2, I still would prefer protecting your corner while threatening H2.]

(;B[fs];W[es];B[dr];W[gs];B[ds];W[cs];B[ar];W[hs]C[MK: Given that the white group ended up living, I think it might have been better for me to take this trade.

G: You mean C1 group for H2 group? I think you gain from having h2 later though.]
;B[ir];W[jr];B[ho];W[is];B[hp];W[er];B[ko];W[jo];B[jp];W[kq]
;B[jl]TR[qc][ll]C[G: the center is already lost, if you want to play here it must be to build a huge territory around RHS, and then I think m8 may be better. OR protect the corner at r17]
;W[im];B[jm];W[hl];B[in];W[en];B[eo];W[co];B[dn]C[MK: At the time I thought this was terribly clever, and my opponent even congratulated me after the game for seeing it, but looking at it now I'm pretty sure that there's no way to save the three stones below if white cuts at C4 on the next move.

G: you are right - but i think white does the right thing by attacking the huge black right/top territory instead.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
(;B[nb]C[MK: This double-hane move is something I just learned, and I'm still learning when it's a good idea. In this case I thought that the M17 stone would help contain the ponnuki that forms during the joseki, but I think I badly underestimated how much support the K17 stone would offer.

G: I think the outside wall you get from the "standard" joseki works so well with your large RHS here that there is no other choice.]

;B[ii];W[hj];B[ij];W[rc]C[MK: Would it have been better to give up the two stones on top to prevent the invasion? To be honest, the invasion didn't even occur to me as a possibility until he'd done it, but I feel like that side was open enough that he would have gotten something in there in any case.

G: I think that his invasion shouldn't live anyway, so taking the corner as well is oK :)]

;B[nk];W[pn];B[po];W[ik];B[jk];W[jj]C[MK: All of those cutting points on the left really hurt me here, any ideas how I should have played to avoid that?

G: It's not so bad I think - you can take some cuts, give up on G14 if nescessary.]

(;B[ji];W[kj];B[il]
(;W[ki]C[G: This is weird by white, if black takes J9 his whole position collapses.]
;B[kr]C[MK: My thinking here was that I should use the ko to steal a few points somewhere. L18 was a stupid place to try to take those points; I think I could have killed the invading group if I had played right.

G: From here on it all goes wrong for black :) 

At first I thought white made a mistake in starting the KO fight now, but see variation (maybe you already read this out)]

(;B[jh];W[hf];B[ig];W[he];B[le]C[MK: Ultimately I did end up killing the three stones, but given that I could have taken out the invading group this was pretty clearly a bad exchange for me.]
;W[la];B[em]TR[bd][bk][bl][cl][rq]C[MK: Since I've already been so badly reduced I felt that my only chance was to reduce white's territory as much as possible before he had a chance to secure it.

G: Indeed - however, this is not the way - again, creep in along the sides! Now it's also end-game time and really time to consider what is sente. S3 for instance is sente, and there is no way white can afford to not answer.]

;B[bo];W[km];B[io];W[mh];B[ng];W[mi];B[qs]C[MK: At the time I thought this was a really neat idea -- a double monkey-jump! If the R4 group wasn't so weak, I think it would even have worked...]
