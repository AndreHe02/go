C[The following review was requested by white (drwhat), though any insights on black's play are welcome.

Thank you for reviewing the game.

I lost this game by 5.5 with only a 0.5  komi,  so it was very even.  There was a LOT of fighting in the game.  It would be difficult to analyze all of them, so I'd be especially interested in the following:

1.  Any big moves missed in the opening,  or more favorable ideas for joseki to help co-ordinate stones.
2.  Any big attacks missed by players in the fights,  or groups left unsafe that should be protected even in gote.
3.  I felt black used sente well in the endgame,  any suggestions to help earn 1-2 points there.  I would have lost this game by 0.5 with regular komi.

Hagios: I'll do my best to help you find some better moves in this game, and perhaps some better ideas.]
;B[pp]LB[cd:B][dd:A]
(;W[dd];B[fd]C[H: This move is regarded as a little bit negative for B, and has to accompany a special whole-board plan.  See the variation at move 2 to explain more fully why.]
(;W[id];B[cf]C[H: This is a difficult position, and I don't know any joseki for it.  I'll explore a couple of possibilities, but a stronger player will need to help find the best way to handle this if you don't play d14 instead of j16.]
(;W[ee]C[H: this is another possibility, but the 3,3 invasion is difficult to deal with.]
(;B[kd]C[H: Strange move.  B is playing a weird opening to try to put W off guard, it seems.  The best way to respond to such a situation is to play calm moves.]
(;W[bd]LB[cd:A]C[drwhat:  I was thinking to secure the corner and leave a possible attack later in the engame.   I should have just played it safe at A]
;B[cc]
(;W[dc]C[drwhat:  Would C16 now have been a better answer (see variation)?   I was trying to keep black split.

H: This move gives up the corner and b16.  This is a painful decision.]

(;W[dq]LB[do:A]C[drwhat:  I felt the J16 could be sacrificed to take one of the 2 corners.

H: The two corners are miai.  Take one, and B will take the other.  in this case, I believe you took the right corner, but the wrong direction.  You left A open, which is painful]
;B[hd]C[drwhat:  This move seems very small, it had to be mistake.]
;W[qc]LB[ci:A][co:B]C[drwhat:  I was thnking I might be slightly ahead here,  so I'd take some secure territory in the last corner, and deny black a natural extension there.

drwhat:  Would pressuring black's group at A,   or securing the bottom corner  B  have been better?

H: B made a blunder by playing at h16.  He should have taken this corner.  Because of this, W is ahead.

The only problem here is that d5 is open.  If the first move you made in the southwest was at B, then you'd be well ahead by now.]
;B[do]C[H: Perfect idea for B];W[co];B[cp]C[drwhat:  I was unfamilir with this cut,  so I had to improvise.]

(;W[kp]LB[qj:B][qn:A]C[drwhat:  Thinking it over I think A or B might have been better.. the right side is more open]
;B[ip]
(;W[iq]C[H: This is a common mistake of kyuu players.  The territory isn't why a wall is valuable.  The wall is valuable because you have strength to attack.]
;B[hq];W[hp];B[jq];W[ir];B[jp];W[hr]C[H: Now we've made just a few points of territory with your 12 stones in this area.  This is bad for W.]
;B[jr];W[lq]C[H: B is now thick in this area.  This move ignores the good advice, "Play away from thickness" and makes a heavy group.]
