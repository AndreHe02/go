C[Hi, I'm Tsinghua, and I'm going to be your commentator on this game. 

You made a lot of fundamental mistakes in fuseki and judgement, so you need to improve this. Your fighting is good though, and your reading seems to be to. 

I hope my comments are useful, if you have any questions, please send me a mail.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo];W[eg]LB[jd:A]C[This seems so silly.  I was trying to get to the center to negate the power of the shimari.  What is the proper response by black?

T: I don't know how to respond to this, but I would probably go for A. Thought the game seems fine too.]
;B[cj];W[cm]LB[ch:A]C[Should black jump out?

T: No. Blacks response was correct. I think A for white could be more efficient though.]
;B[cg];W[ee]TR[eg]C[T: The marked stone looks awkward now.]
;B[ic]LB[bd:B][jd:A]C[T: High at A is slightly better. However, large knight move at B is more urgent.]

(;W[ei]LB[bf:A]C[T: A to attack. (var.)];B[bd];W[ek];B[dh];W[eh]
;B[jq]LB[ic:11][ld:A]TR[ei][ek]C[How can I make effecient use of this wall.....or is black already winning?  Who do you think has the bettter position?

T: Well, I think the marked stones were a little wasted as black doesn't really have any weaknesses, so you cannot use your wall yet.

I think A is very tempting though, which is why black 11 was a little bad. However, it is had to see a good game for white.]
;W[nc];B[lc]
(;W[ne]LB[ld:A]C[A (var.)

T: the common rule is to attach to the strong stones, so therefore A is better.]
;B[pf];W[ng];B[mf];W[nf];B[ph]LB[mf:1][nf:2]C[T: the two lase black moves don't relate very well, so the exchange 1,2 is probably bad for black.]
;W[qj]C[T: I think this move is a little over ambigious, but it's tough for white, so overplays cannot be seen as too bad of an idea.]
;B[oi];W[ni];B[nj];W[mi];B[pc];W[nd]LB[mc:A][ld:B]TR[pc]C[T: at least play A or B to be active, this move is too passive. Making black's move eficient rather than slow.]

(;B[mj]C[n10 seems to slow to me

T: it is huge (var.)];W[ro]LB[li:A]C[T: A is the only move, unless you live in sente, the situation is unplayable for white. (var.) 

S5 will probably live in gote, therefore, game already looks over for white.]

(;B[qn];W[rn]
(;B[qm]LB[rm:A]C[T: White is so busy, so black A would be better. (var.)]
;W[rm];B[ri]LB[qp:A]TR[qj]C[A is more urgent, the marked stone is not so big.]
;W[ql];B[rp];W[pl];B[rk];W[rj];B[sj];W[qi];B[rh];W[si];B[sh]
;W[sl]C[Any better variations for black or white?];B[li]C[To me this was where I started to feel that I was going to win.  Because why is black fighting here.  This only works to my advantage....Or am I wrong?

T: Game should be over for white. However, white got a little better result on the right. However, still, it should be over.]

;B[ol];W[pm]
(;B[on]LB[oo:A][qp:B]C[T: Black is not thinking. A is alot better. 

The game is still close, and he must have considered the cut at B, so this shows black is panicking.(var.)]
;W[om];B[nm];W[qp];B[qq];W[nn];B[mm];W[mn];B[oo];W[lm]C[This is good reading from white, and bad from black.]

;B[cf];W[iq]LB[de:C][ip:A][hq:B]C[T: Bad.

There is no reason for this. A and B are understandable, but this is not so good. Also, I hope you have considered black C (var.)]

(;B[jp];W[hr]LB[mp:B][jr:A]C[This I also find a little unexplainable.

The follow up at A is small because you also have B];B[gq]LB[de:A]
C[T: Desperate.

A is obviously better.];W[ip];B[io]C[T: Overplay];W[jr];B[gi]
;W[fg]LB[de:A]C[T: good exchange for white, A doesn't work anymore. Game is over now.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[cp]C[c4 seems like a blunder.  Of course I will give up the corner

T: No, black has no chance living outside the corner. No more comments from here. Until the end.]

Please sum up what exactly went wrong for both players and what they did right also.

T: I think this game was very messy. White's opening was miserable, but the fighting was better than blacks throughout the game.
Black had a good opening, but was very greedy and let an enormous lead slip away.]

Black: 26+17+12+10 = 55

So white is ahead with a little more than komi. However, I think this shows how big blacks lead was before he lost the middle stones.]
