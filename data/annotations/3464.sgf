AB[pd][dp]C[[Rich\] - Hi, I was white in this game. I lost in the end because I overlooked an atari in byo-yomi, but I was still behind by five points or so. I'd be especially interested in general midgame tips, as I feel I missed a couple of vital points and got the direction wrong a few times, so I ended up scrambling to survive. and making small, walled-in groups a couple of times.

djna - my comments will be prefixed like this.

djna - One general comment W in handicap games is always vulnerable to B playing good moves ;-) It only takes W to be a little below par and B to be a bit above par for a two-stone game to be really tough.

djna - the yose had a lot of errors by bothe sides - I guess time trouble had something to do with that. You could easily make up a 5 point difference by more
effectively finding sente and reverse-sente plays. Don't forget reverse-sente of 5 points is worth more than 9 points in gote.

Otherwise the game actually swung when B successfully invaded W's moyo in sente.]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[ce]C[
djna - personal peference, but I always feel that W needs influence in handicap games so a low approach strikes me as a little conservative.]
;B[fd];W[ch];B[cn]LB[cc:C][cd:A][de:B]C[djna - b should exchange A for B, W has the option of  settling at C.

The move B played seems slow. W is low on the left  so I don't see great urgency to prevent W from approach at the bottom left.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qj]LB[qe:A][pf:B][qj:C]C[djna - A/B exchange bad, Extension all the way to C favours W]
;B[jd];W[fq]C[[Rich\] - This looks too close in retrospect. K3 instead?

;W[ck]LB[fo:A]C[djna : that's another  very confident move.

A seems like a really key point in the shape. I would want to keep the H3 B group isolated.]
;B[el];W[fo];B[dn];W[dr]C[[Rich\] - The group lives, but gets shut in.

djna: Yes, B seems to get less benefit from all this than he should,
somehow you get three moves on teh outside and still live easily.]
;B[co];W[jj]C[[Rich\] - K7 or the LR corner now instead? I was thinking of a ladder-breaker for around E7, but I just read badly.

djna: Allowing B to join his groups seems bad

I'd live at E5, B will need to defend the cut  but still have weaknesses.
Then Your move is actually quite interesting.

I think the corner is too slow, K7 is reasonable.];B[eo];W[gq]
;B[do]C[
djna: but in effect B has allowed you three moves elsewhere in exchange for thicknes that's hard to use well]
;W[hd]C[[Rich\] - Not a great spot, but I wasn't sure where to go. The whole invasion/reduction here started messily.

djna: big question is whether it's necessary to invade. Suppose you play O3 or somewhere like that. K10 virtually ensures that B can't grow the upper side too well.

Or O14 starts to grow a serious side..

My counting suggests that W should be building rather than invading.]

djna - The big question for me is whether the W group on teh upper side is

If it is then A starts to make enough territory to win];W[kf]
C[
djna so I think that this is a little slow.];B[lf];W[kg]C[[Rich\] - Now black helps white settle, luckily.

djna. I see it more as B getting enough leverage to greatly reduce W]
;B[lg];W[kh];B[qn]C[

djna: the black snake backs up this invasion quite usefully]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[mp]LB[np:A]C[hmmm

djna: indeed. A is usually right];B[ql];W[rm]LB[ef:F][ok:B]
[pk:A][rm:C][ro:D][qq:E]C[
djna: rule of thumb - confine and then play the key pont. 

Also the W group on the right  side is nearly cut off

A or B seem better for W than C.

If B tried to make eye shap at C then W gets moves near D to prevent the invasion at E.

The result W needs (assuming B cannot be killed) is to let B live, but seal off the lower side, and make the R10 group safe. And do all that in sente to take F, 

The game is close if W does that.

As it is W gets confined and B gets pressure against teh lowers side later.]

;W[ok];B[ol];W[mi]LB[pk:A]C[
djna: I suppose that the idea here is to build more strength for the attack?
That's a  reasonable way of thinking, the problem is in teh details.

I'd play A first. Surely B must respond and W is much stronger as a result]
;B[ni];W[nh]C[
djna: this, as you comment ,is a bad move. Cross cuts tend to be problematic close to opponent's strength.]

C[
djna: W needs to keep sente if at all possible. This move is big, 10 points or so, but is pretty much gote - later you have to answer Black A.

Playing A yourself is very close to sente, and Black B is gote, so you may even get chance to play later]

djna: now B takes sente


It's worth reflecting what really happened in the last phase:

B has reduced W's moyo significantly AND retained sente. So this
is a really bad result for W.

I've marked my estimate of territories here, and I think Black is at least 5 points 
ahead with sente.  As far as I can see there are no groups to attack once B stablises his top left.

So effectively the game should be over. I reckon that cross cut was the prime cause.
And more generally, the failed attack on B's invasion of the moyo.

However, with good play in the yose W in a handicap games expects to get a bit back. so we don't give up the game, but in terms of improving in future games, I think that it's a matter of studying the earlier part of the game.]

[ii][hj][ij][hk][ik]C[[Rich\] - G9 looks much better.

djna: G9 would be consistent with the previous moves, but how many new points
would it make? And would it be sente?

I suppose the whole sequence  would be more than 6 points inj value
because B has has his territory reduced too. But it's just too small.]
