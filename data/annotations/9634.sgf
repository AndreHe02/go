That is correct. See variation.]

;W[gi];B[qn];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[pk]LB[pg:B][on:A]C[A more aggressive?  playing to a larger mojo?

This is perfectly fine. Black is already ahead in territory and Q9 is a simple and safe option that also protects against the cut at B that White could still consider (although it has become weaker).]
;W[jq]
(;B[ep]LB[ci:B][co:D][do:A][ep:C]C[better at A? becuz of support at B?

C is playable, but A or D seem like better choices. Black is already ahead in territory and should be content with keeping the game simple and simply dividing the remaining territory equally. There's no need to start a fight, which C sort of provokes.]
;W[cn]
(;B[cl]LB[ep:C][gq:B][hq:A]C[better at A to make a base? the actual played move secures a base to a group which is already alive.

Yes. A is much more important! When White plays B next, he fixes all weaknesses in his bottom group and the C stone comes under attack.]
;W[gq]LB[ii:A][nn:C][jo:B]C[Black's E4 stone is in an awkward spot now. There seems to be no way to connect it to the group on the left and trying to live will put it under attack: the resulting fight will benefit white greatly in her attempt to make up the difference in territory.

It might be best to ignore the stone and focus on other parts of the board. Black can reactivate it later when the surrounding position has changed or sacrifice it completely when White invests more moves to capture it.

Moves like A, B or C look attractive.];B[em];W[en];B[fn];W[dm]
;B[eo];W[dn];B[go];W[dl]
(;B[ck]C[If Black really wants to play like this he needs to ignore the threat of White C9 now and invest another move to strengthen his weak group.

As it stands the Black group has no eyes yet and there's no supporting group in the area that Black could connect to. White can now play J11 to reduce Black or K5 to improve his own territory while simultaneously weakening the already weak Black group in the lower left.]

Dame: 8 stones
Result: W+14.5

Black was ahead nearly the whole game but gave it away in the endgame. The disaster at the top was particularly unnecessary and gave White many points.

Overall I think you could benefit from looking at the big picture more frequently to notice groups that are becoming weak both for yourself and your opponent.]

It's not a move that White will play immediately, but the aji remains and is something that Black will have to worry about.

If Black plays at A (Joseki) instead, White can only cut by making bad shape and the cut will be much less severe.]
