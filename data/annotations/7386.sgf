C[Dear reviewer,
In this game I played as White and lost by 1.5 points.
The game was played on the KGS.
I would especially like if You could point out  the opening mistakes because I think that is what I am weakest.
Thanks for the review in advance.

Hi. Thanks for the opportunity to review. Overall you played a combination of too jealously, and too defensively. You created weak groups, and defended them very cautiously. You should run at least once before defending. This allowed black to get well ahead. Later on, thanks to your stronger endgame skills, you were able to catch up a lot, which made the game seem closer than it should have been.]
;B[pp];W[cc];B[dp];W[pd];B[nc];W[pf];B[kc];W[pc]C[Q: This move is probably what good players would call slow however I really do not know what should I have played as the alternative.

It's quite big, and creates a very solid shape (presumably you didn't like the aji remaining if you played Q18), but it induces a follow up that rather hurts your c17 stone. In terms of alternatives, any of the corner approaches are viable, like R6, O3, F3, C6]
;B[hc];W[fc]C[Q: Was this move good or bad?

I don't think it's much good. You're approaching a really strong group. Black is low, so there's no real need to worry. Approach D4 or Q4.]

(;W[jq]C[I don't think this is as urgent as preventing the turn at C14.]
;B[cf]C[C: This is very very painful. That group is now cut off from the game.]
;W[ck]C[I think this is a jealous move, you're determined not to let black get anything from his thickness. But all you're doing is creating a pincerable stone. I think you need to rather approach the D4 stone. If you play at C6, you'll probably get pincered, but that's ok. Later on you can reduce the left/top.]
;B[be];W[cd];B[cm];W[ch];B[hq];W[mq];B[oq]C[C: White now has two weak groups. One could, if one was being severe, say the game is already over.]
;W[cq]C[I don't think you need to rush into this. The double wing is not that big, and apart from C3, there's also F3. I would favour strengthening your two weak groups on the left and bottom.]
;B[cp]C[Very interesting direction. H3 is wider than C7, but I think black is planning to build a wall to help with the attack on C9.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[fr];W[dr];B[qn]
C[This is very big for black, and I think white would have been better off approaching this group rather than playing san-san at C3.]

(;W[qi]C[This is big, but black can now attack two weak groups. Groups like K3+N3 are not as strong as they may seem, especially if your opponent has stones one space away, as he does at P3, H3. Your left hand group is just as weak.]
;B[qk];W[oi]TR[qg][mo]SQ[pk][pl][pm][pn][po][pp][pq]C[Q: I was worried about the possible invasion around R13. Should I have attacked B's wall with N5 or something like that insted ot this?

For 42 I rather favour defending one of your weak groups. N5 or K5, for example. Black can attack on a large scale, but the groups also have a tactical weakpoint - see the variations.]

(;B[ok]C[42 is very defensive. I think black made an error with 43. Unless he plans to actually capture N3 on a large scale (which will be almost impossible), this move is rather weak.]
;W[nr]C[This is oriented towards big endgame moves later, and as such, has some merit. However, given black's central thickness, I would favour moving towards the middle to try and reduce the impact.]

;B[hn];W[im];B[hm];W[kn];B[il];W[jl];B[ik];W[bg];B[bf]
(;W[bd]C[This feels too slow. I don't think black can kill your corner, so its just an endgame move. You need to defend your group on the left, and reduce black's central potential on the bottom left and upper side.]

;B[fh]
(;W[ah]C[I think you're probably correct to defend your group, I'm not sure it can be killed but it would make me nervous. B8 is perhaps a better direction, however (bigger).]
;B[el]C[C: This feels like bad shape (toothpaste tube).]
(;W[mc]C[This is a peculiar fight to provoke. I'd prefer to see a normal reduction move somewhere around the sector line, perhaps L13. In fact, probing first with M16 would be an interesting way to play. If black answers passively at M17, then white can probably go in even deeper.

Locally, N16 is the more normal way to reduce.];B[md]C[There is a vital double sente move at S10.

The biggest moves for black now are F9 or something around L14. Any attack on N17 should bear this in mind.]

;B[oa];W[na];B[od];W[oe];B[jb];W[ka];B[mj]C[This move makes no sense. L10 or L13 would be more interesting, and of course, S10.]
;W[pa];B[nd];W[mf]C[Good. Could perhaps go deeper, but after the wall on top and N10, it could be a little risky.]
;B[lf]
(;W[mg]C[Could consider the hane at M13. A mutual destruction policy would favour white far more than black.]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[kh];W[li];B[ki];W[ni];B[lj]C[This doesn't help black at all, and gives white a chance to get back into the game. From being comfortably ahead, with N10 and N11 black has let it become close again.]
