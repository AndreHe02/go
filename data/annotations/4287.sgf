C[Neil: hello reviewer,
In this game I played black, I lost the game in the late middle-game.
The game i think was close for a long time but white edged ahead.
There were many decisions to make during the early and mid-game.
Perhaps you could help me choose where to play, where is urgent/big

Many thanks,
Neil Mclean.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[cn];W[dn]C[(Slightly unusual for white to play a contact move this early.)]

(;B[co];W[bq];B[cl];W[fp]C[(A bit slow, K4 is probably bigger for white.)]
;B[kq]LB[oc:D][od:C][ce:B][de:A]C[It is a good idea to split up white's side, and this is the right move to achive that aim. However, is it the biggest move on the board? A shimari is very big too.]
;W[mq];B[hq];W[lo];B[fr];W[eq];B[ho]C[This is a reasonable outcome on the bottom edge.]
;W[od];B[ld]C[Good. This is an excellend combination of pincer and extension from the top left.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc]
(;B[qf]LB[re:A]C[Not good. The normal move is A.];W[rb]C[Now white pretty much has two eyes, so you pincer stones is not that great any more.]
;B[de]C[Good. Big move.];W[jc]
(;B[ke]LB[hc:A][pj:B]C[Because white is alive in the top right, this one black stone is not so important. There is no need to run away immediately.

You have another option of giving it up in exchange for territory by playing A, and if you do nothing, it takes white several moves to actually capture your stone, so perhaps for now you should keep your options open.

You could also consider something like B, to defend your group on the top right before white gets a chance to pincer it.]
;W[gc]C[Extending towards the shimari is exactly what white wants to do, and you have just encouraged him to do that by running away with your unimportant weak stone.]
;B[qi]C[Important. Good.];W[ql]C[Neil: Perhaps white and black have made some mistakes upto now, maybe there were some urgent points we both missed.

Tim: See previous comments.];B[kc]C[I am not sure that this is the most important move. Invading the bottom corner at R3 or R4 is very big. This area is one move away from becoming solid territory. This is often a good moment to invade.

Instead of this attack, the knight's move at L18 might be better shape.]
;W[jd];B[qq]C[Good.]
(;W[pq]C[(Wrong direction for white. The proverb says "block on the wider side" and it is almost always right.)]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro]
(;W[qn]C[(White should at least play the double-hane variation.)]

(;B[pr]C[You should crawl once more first.];W[or];B[qr];W[rn]
;B[rp];W[ch]C[This is dangerous for white. The white group at the top is quite weak, and white has just made a second weak group in the same quarter of the board. You should be planning a splitting attack.]

(;B[cf]C[So this might be the wrong direction. Normally you start by driving the two weak groups closer together, so when you play your splitting move, it is a severe attack on both of them.

The other problem with playing in this direction is that the black group in the lower left is weak, you don't want to encourage white to move towards it and make it weaker.]
;W[bj];B[bk]C[Neil:  I thought a while about this move,
It seems to me I have 4 weak groups and white has 3-4 also.
So I want to attack as soon as possible and white does too, but where ? and what / how first ?

Neither player has more than 2 weak groups. The two white ones in the top left quarter of the board, and the black one in the bottom left and the one in the top middle. The others are all alive, at least until the other player manages to get overwealming thickness nearby, which is not likely at present.]
;W[cj]
(;B[bp]C[Ithink that this is too defensive (unless you think that this makes D2 into an interesting move). It would be better to move out into the centre and defend your group by attacking the white one above.]

(;W[rh]C[Strange move by white.];B[qh];W[ri];B[qj];W[rj];B[rg]
;W[qk]C[White has made a tiny amount of second line territory. Black has made thickness. Since this is a fighting game. Black should be happy with this exchange.]

(;B[rd]C[I think that this move is too slow. It does not make the black group completely alive, adn anyway this black group is strong enough for now, since it has lots of access to the centre. Also, you move does not weaken the white group above it very much. If this move did give black two clear eyes, and/or made the white group much weaker, then it would be excellent.

However, in this position, I think it is much more interesting to attack the weak white group on the left, which white ignored. See the variation for one possibility.]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[of];B[dr]C[Neil: This turns out to be a horrible mistake.

Yes. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

The white groups in the upper left quater of the board are much weaker, and would make much more interesting targets for attack.]
;W[er];B[es];W[cr];B[fq];W[gp];B[gq]C[This is the wrong connection. Keeping your group connected to the centre is much more important, and white virtually has two eyes anyway, so saving the D2 stone is not that important.]

C[Neil: I decide to try here instead.

Much better plan.];W[gd]
(;B[ei]C[Don't ignore the white move. (Generally, you don't ignore contact moves.)

C[There go your attacking chances, and with them, your best chances for winning the game.]
;B[fd];W[gf];B[he];W[ed];B[fc];W[ec];B[fb];W[eb]C[Neil: My splitting attack turns into an exchange not what i had planned
Also white seems better for the exchange.

Yes, the exchange is a complete disaster for black, the top left corner is huge, while the four white stones are not.]
;B[gb];W[ee];B[hc];W[cc]C[I think this is essentially game-over. 

Try estimating the territory:

White:

Top left: 30+
Bottom left: 10
Bottom right: 20-
Top right: 5
Komi: 5

Total: 70

Black:

Top middle: 20+
Bottom left: 10
Bottom middle: 10-
Bottom right: 5
Top right: 5

Total: 50

I suppose that the white group in the top right is a little weak, so you might be able to get a little profit from attacking it, but I doubt that you can get 20 points worth. Also, white M2 reduces your bottom group to only one eye, so white can make some gains while attacking too. You have some chance of making central territory, but again, not 20 points worth.]

(;B[qb]C[Do you really think that you can kill white. If so, this is right. If not, it might be better to let white live in exchange for central territory (see variation).]
;W[mh]C[You are forcing white to run into the centre where you hope to make territory.]
;B[ng]C[Neil: I couldnt think what to do, so I know this is not the best move.

I think that you are trying too hard to kill a group that is unkillable. That just helps white get stronger.]

;W[ml];B[kl]C[Before playing a move like this would be another good time to estimate the score. (A defensive move like this is great if it leaves you 5+ points ahead, it is a terrible mistake if it leaves you 5+ points behind).

Yes, but I think it is too big an 'if'.

(Why does white bother with this move? even if it is sente, it does not gain any points, so it is just a waste of a ko threat.)]

Neil: So to sum up, I liked playing this game. There were many weak groups to attack and so it was exciting.

Neil: What did I do wrong, did I play Ok and just miss one or two moves or was there some big flaws in my thinking. Did I miss wrong direction / where to attack etc ...?

Tim: I think that you are failing to grasp the important points and the right direction when attacking. Of course, those are really advanced concepts, and at the hightest level, are probably one of the differences between top professionals and the others. However, at the most basic level, these are probably one of the things that makes the difference between a 3 kyu and a dan player.

You need to start developing your skills in these areas.

If you have never read it, I strongly recommend the book "Attack and Defense" from the Elementary Go Series. This is one of the best Go books in English. And if you have read it before, it is probalby time for you to read it again, to refresh your memory. 

You might also start playing through some professional games while concentrating on which groups they choose to attack, when, and what they get out of it. For pro games, try gobase.org, or GoGoD for electornic game records. Alternatively, if you want your games in a book with  commentary, "The 1971 Honinbo Tournament" is another excellent book.]
