C[This was a game played on OGS. Each player had 5 byo-yomi times of 45 seconds. I think it is a fairly good amount of time (more than most of other games played online, I think) and I am confortable playing within these time limits.]

;B[bd];W[bc]C[You really can't leave this.  If you're not going to respond, you shouldn't have played b16 at all.]
;B[ed]C[this is wrong.  If white responds (as expected) you end up with a stronger white corner and a very weak
attached black stone.];W[dd];B[df]C[The sequence 9-15 was stupid, right? I should have played a known joseki, mainly because josekis are sequences known to be good, and I tried to come up with something new, but ended up in a bad position. Right? Or totally wrong?]

(;B[dr]C[Was 71 unnecessary? I am thinking that I may have lost the game here, wasting this move. At the time I though my group would be in trouble without it.

Not necessary.  White can't cause any trouble.];W[jp];B[ir]
;W[mm];B[op]C[Before you play here, you should think "where will my eyes be".  Sometimes you can
plausibly think they will be outside somewhere, but not in this case.  Sometimes in
situations like this, you have to be willing to abandon a few stones to save the rest,
or if nothing can be saved, don't add any more stones to the "donor" pool.

So with those considerations, P4 is a reasonable play, but both]

;B[ll];W[kl];B[lm];W[mk];B[nj];W[ml];B[nl]C[clearly a misread - the threatened cut is meaningless, and you need eye shape if you're going to live.]
;W[nm];B[gf]C[this totally misses the situation.  Black has a large chunk of stones on the right, with poor prospects for making 
more than one eye.   Abandoning such a large group is unthinkable.  Either resign or fight it out on the right.]
;W[fg]C[this applies equally to white.  Unless you consider the right side settled in your favor, you should treat
black's tenuki as a blunder, and continue the fight on the right.  S8 looks like a good choice to start.]

(;W[on]TR[km]SQ[rp]C[rather than turn your stones into an ugly clump, better to make a live group by capturing at L7.
Best is to read that responding directly is unnecessary, and play S4 to kill the black group.]

C[B definitely.  If white cuts at A, you just ladder it off.    There's no way white should be able to get into
this corner given black's massive presence.]

a live shape if he plays here.]

Both players: tactics are a bit weak.  Practice reading.   Opening play is a little too agressive, and
pay attention to making eye shape.  Remember that every group has to have a home.]
