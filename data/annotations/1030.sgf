It has been played on IGS Between Me (ShereKahn B 30k, and pes 30k, IGS rankings)]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[ce]C[I wouldn't call this a bad move, but I know people who recommend that newer players stick to the star points in the opening, because that's what they're most familiar with.]

;W[de];B[dd];W[fe];B[gd]C[At this point in the game, K4 is the biggest point on the board; whoever plays on or around there first will have an advantage.

On the other hand, it's more important to play an urgent move - one that needs to be played to avoid giving the opponent too much advantage in a fight - than a big one, so
knowing _when_ to play K4 is a judgement call.];W[cf];B[bf]
;W[bg];B[bd];W[mc]C[What's the better way to respond ?

Blocking on the sides is not bad, though it's generally better not to play directly in contact
with a lone, weak enemy stone - contact plays are more recommended for defense, and non-contact plays for attack.

Capping the W stone is not bad either, butB's position is wide enough that W can threaten to escape, and develop strength on the top.  The center will become important for B then, and it's not as easy to make large terriroties in the center as on the sides and corners.]

(;B[nc];W[lc];B[kc];W[le]C[One of the best things to do with weak enemy positions is to attack them, not in hopes of killing them, but in ways that let you make territory while your opponent is busy staying alive.  In this case...]

Could he get his group to live ?

No, W can't live, and it doesn't even reduce B's score because each W stone will end up
as a prisoner.  It's not even good as a ko threat, since W would need more than two moves
in a row to live.];B[rk];W[pk];B[ok];W[ql];B[rl];W[qs];B[cp]
C[How should I invade here ?

It's probably not possible to successfully invade now, but the 3-3 point would have worked earlier when the area was still fairly open, as I show at move 137.

Generally, an enclosed area is safe unless there's weak points to cut at, or it's much larger than the one here and it's possible to live inside.]

It would have been safe to ignore L1, as W's dead stones have so few liberties.  I'll show
a few variations.];W[ol];B[om];W[pl];B[rj]C[is this  move a 1 point loss ?

Well How did I behave ? Was my playing  not too bad ? What are my obvious weaknesses, and how should I Try to correct them ?

Thanks again for your comments.


And thank you for the honor of seeking my humble opinions :>

I don't see any major mistakes in this game, just things that I would do differently.  My suggestions for improving are:

- During the opening, if there's a large, empty region of the board - like an unoccupied side - ignore the first move of your opponent that you dare to and play there instead.
That's usually where the most profit is to be had - and it helps you learn what moves you
_don't_ dare ignore :>

- Study life and death - not necessarily deeply, but know the classical living and dead
shapes, and practice recognizing them in actual game situations.  For instance, in this game, life and death was key in the upper left corner.

- Think about invading an area before it becomes sealed off from the rest of the board; invasions are a lot safer when it's possible to escape.  Once an area is sealed off, instead of invading look for opportunities to slice some stones off by cutting, like I show W doing at move #216.  And beware of your opponent doing that to you :>

Again, thanks for letting me review your game; if you have questions, or if my review or my SGF is anywhere not clear, feel free to ask.
