C[wyv [3k?\]: hi
Biondy [7k\]: hai


Dear reviewer, my name is Biondy and this is my game in KGS which I lose .
I hope you can help me with this game and also improve my game.

We have a little discussion after that. We don't speak English, so I'll translate it


erker: Hello, Biondy!
I will do the review. I hope you will enjoy it.
My remarks are prefixed with "erker:"];B[pd];W[dq]C[wyv [3k?\]: iy]

SQ[ec]C[wyv [3k?\]: ini kurang baik sebenernya
translate: this move is not good

well, this move is experimental. Hope you can help me with this


erker: Experimentation is a good thing. But you also need a plan. Otherwise, how do you tell that your experiment was a success?

If you don't know where to play, ask yourself: why play at all?
(You want to defend this group, You want to attack that group etc.)

I will try to explain some of the reasons behind the moves A to C in the variations. (Please keep in mind that I will only give one single line of play to show the general idea. Some of them may have very difficult variation or follow ups. And of course they are not the only possible moves, among the others are D-H.) 
From this and from later explanations it will be clear why I don't think that your move is a good one.]
;W[id];B[he];W[ie];B[de]LB[dd:E][hd:A][id:B][he:C][ie:D][hf:F]
TR[ic]C[I'm a little confused here. Where should I go here?


erker: As we have seen, close contact plays make both groups strong, and this strength is needed for one of two reasons: defence (you're in danger and need some strength, quick; Move 7, 1st Variation [E\]) or attack (Move 7, 2nd Variation [d15\]). In most cases, the stone or group you're leaning on is out of the question for attack: it is against common sense to strengthen the enemy before attack.

After the exchange A for B and C for D it is far more difficult to attack the marked white stone. Therefore the strength you gain by pushing against the white corner with your last move is wasted: it can not be used to attack the marked white stone, because (a) you made it strong and (b) your strength is blocked by A and C.

To summarize: with your last three moves you played in a defencive only manner. If you want defence, play at E instead of A, C, and d15. But even better is to attack (play straight at d15 without A and C).


As a side note: The proverb says: "Play hane at the head of two stones" -- White wants to play at F sometime in the future as this ruins Blacks shape.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[cf]C[wyv [3k?\]: jakarta];B[dg];W[ch];B[mc]LB[hf:A]
C[Is this move ok?


erker: In principle, this is the right way to play -- you attack and pick some profit while White has to run away.

But this will also hurt your upper left group (imagine that White can play at A).]
;W[ig];B[jf]LB[if:A]C[erker: This is very bad!

The exchange k14 for A does not help you on the right, it hurts you on the left, and you never know if you later want to peep from the other side.]
;W[if];B[ei]LB[dh:A]C[erker: As you later see, this is problematic. Maybe A is better.]
;W[dh];B[eh]C[wyv [3k?\]: hebat dong];W[fg];B[ff]LB[fg:C][dh:A]
[ei:B]C[Maybe I should connect instead of this. I misread here.


erker: If you connect, your group is out in the open but with terrible shape. But that's better than two isolated groups.

If you had played on A instead of B, White C would not had this effectiveness.]

[ig]C[I try to build area here.

should I play the joseki instead of this?


erker: You should keep in mind that the marked black stones and q11 are on the 4th line. You're building influence -- a moyo -- and not territory. White can easily invade, but that is OK, Black only needs a plan to deal with this invasion.

Also notice that the marked white wall will reduce the power of your influence.]

;B[cn]LB[qd:B][ne:C][qe:A][of:E][co:D]TR[mc][pd][qf]C[I want to answer w last move, but don't know how. Could you please help me?


erker: I think your move A should be at B. That way it works better with the two marked black stones. One black continuation (with A at B) is C, or you play elsewhere.

With your move A at A, both C and playing elsewhere look a bit strange.

As B is not as aggressive as A, White may choose to enclose the lower left corner with E instead of D. That is very big, but then you can capture the marked White stone on a large scale.]

;B[fk]LB[gh:C][cj:B][fp:A]C[erker: This is way to slow: you only connect two weak groups without eye space. You should think about a more active way to defend your group. Something White can not ignore. (For example A, B, or C).]

erker: If you think that you can't win the ko, don't start it.
Use your time to create more ko-threats for yourself and eliminate threats of your opponent. Then start the ko. If your opponent gets nervous and resolves the ko, that means you get an extra move for free.]

actually I don't think so because black is weak. which one is true?


erker: Black has at most an eye around A, B and C. White can only hope for an eye at D (there is no eye in the center around E), but it's White's turn.
 If White plays next at F, both eyes at A and B are gone, and Black is in big trouble.

So keep things simple and just play at F instead at l17 and White is dead.]

;W[ce];B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[dg]LB[bb:B][gc:A]TR[ic]C[erker: Black can play at A or B, so the Black group is secure.
This line of play is attractive if there is no chance to attack the marked white stone, for example if the upper right corner where white.

As a rule: When in danger, play contact moves to settle quickly.

But the upper right corner is black, so an attack is possible and therefore one of the other variations may be better.]

(;B[de]C[erker: This is also a close contact play, resulting in both groups getting stronger. But the emphasis is not to get a secure base in the corner but to build a wall.]

(;B[ef]LB[gc:B][de:A]TR[ic]C[erker: This is the same general idea as the variation before (A): play on the left to get some kind of strength to attack the marked white stone.

(;B[df]C[wyv [3k?\]: ini ada joseki nya
translate: here is the joseki


erker: Technically, this is joseki. But it's obviously not _the_ joseki, as all the other variations are also joseki.
And it is definitive not a joseki I can recommend: Don't play it.

This may sound a bit strong, but this joseki is _the_ proverbial difficult joseki. (If you are curious, google the net for "Taisha Joseki".) Chances are high that you will loose at least half of your groups if you make a mistake. And don't count on your opponent playing the sequence given in this variation. Out of malice or (more likely) ignorance he will divert. So you have to understand every single move in this joseki.]
