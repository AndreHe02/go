This was a 1 kyu game on IGS. My friend has said I'd be comfortable as a 3 kyu on this server, but I figured I would try to go higher and see if I could learn from my opponents.

While I feel comfortable on servers like Tygem, the moyo-based passive style of IGS is very hard to me to handle. My invasion abilities I feel) are weak. and I have a hard time sensing the big moves. As a result, I have relatively few comments, mostly because I'm not sure what I can do differently.

With that in mind, any tips to help that part of my game would be greatly appreciated!

I was white in this game.

A: Hello! Some tips from this game:
- Moyo is just an area of your partner's stones, you can reduce or (not often) invade it as well as territory. When you invade first somewhere, don't stay too long under attack, as it helps your partner to enclose other areas around your weak group. So, make a light shape, two eyes, escape fast towards the center, counterattack if possible, etc.

- Sacrificing stones is the following: you give up one stone (sometimes two, more rarely - three) for getting profit (usually, it is a good shape or a stone needed for a combo/capturing race nearby). When you quit a fight where you could do better (if it occurs in your partner's area, it doesn't mean yet that every fight is bad for you), it's just a local loss, not a sacrifice. Please, mind this difference in advance.

- Keep an eye on professional games or possibly some books, in order to know what the common responses and counter-strategies to that high-Chinese opening (and other openings as well) are. If you like, you can learn some new-fashioned ways in addition.

Good luck!];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[ip]C[already was at a loss haha. I'm so not used to influence based strategies.

A: Oh. Let me show you some common ways :)]
(;W[pj]C[Figured stopping him from getting bot sides and having a high stone to run to if an invasion went sour would be a good thing]
;B[dj];W[nq]LB[ep:3][lq:1][qq:2]C[this seemed as good a point as any to try to invade haha

A: Really? A 4-4 stone has a weakness in 3-3, so as Black should play like both 1 and 2 to close territory here, it's no need to hurry. I think 3 is a key point because it's no good to let Black have this 'shimari with 2 wings' shape.]
;B[lq];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn]
;B[pn];W[qm]C[A: White connected here, but Black's wall is too good. I think Q10 would be better at Q7 to turn or anywhere else now, as Black doesn't plan to invade the right side at all.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[nc];W[kc];B[qf]TR[kc][pj]C[A: You have some stones here, so don't let Black live in this area easily. Shouldn't you take a revenge for the bottom-right corner result?]

(;W[oe];B[qc];W[qd];B[rd];W[re];B[rb];W[sd];B[rc];W[qe];B[ol]
C[A: This move by Black is very good. I think White should invade now, as he already lost in the terms of influence size.
If Black does something like R8 after that, it's no big deal.]
;W[pl];B[ok]
(;W[pk]C[A: Again, very slow - should be at P10. I doubt if Black can take profit of this small weakness.]

(;B[pm]C[A: I didn't get Black's intentions to defense, too.]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj];W[ch]
(;B[bd]C[A: Oh. That's usually a bad thing, as Black could take the corner. On the other hand, have you thought about the following exchange in the game?]

(;W[cc];B[dg];W[dh];B[eh];W[cj];B[ck]C[I thought maybe I could use this to cross cut and get a foothold on his side of the board]
;W[dk];B[ei];W[cl];B[bk];W[bl];B[bj]
(;W[ej]C[A: What's this move? Sacrificing is NOT about just giving up your stones for other stones, it's about taking profit.]
;B[di];W[co]C[A: Also, the side choice is strange - there's a lot of space between C4 and J4 stones, why you chose a very small gap between C4 and C9?]

(;B[el]C[A: Black's doing strange things here, much better to attack the whole group while enclosing center area.]

;W[gp];B[io];W[iq];B[jq];W[ir];B[jr];W[hr];B[er];W[fr]C[after this sequence, I felt semi-optimistic about the game. However, I think I could have done what I wanted to do without sacrificing 9 stones. This is another issue I have with trying to invade, I tend to cut massive amounts of small groups of stones loose in my attempts

A: As it looks for me, you took about 4 points with this living group but gave up everything around - if you didn't invade at all, it would be hard for Black to enclose so much points.]
;B[mi];W[nh];B[nf]LB[hm:1]TR[hj][ij][jj][kj][lj][hl]C[A: Black is doing shit things, as he can win right now by playing 1. It encloses 50 (!) points in the center, the top right corner is at least 7 points, and the left side is not less than 45 points, 102 in total. White's bottom group gives (with D2) about 7 pts, left side is not bigger than 50, and the top side can't become bigger than 30, 93 in total (with komi).
If White ignores and plays 1 now, it can possibly reverse the game.]

;B[hl];W[hm];B[im]
(;W[gl];B[in];W[hk];B[gm];W[gi];B[fi];W[ii]C[thought maybe I could fight my way back to the top

A: Again, the sacrifice is unnecessary, and it should be closer to your stones.]
