C[Thank you for the review.

Any comments and hints will be appreciated. I added some questions along the way in situations where i wasn't sure about the next move.

;W[dd];B[pj]LB[fc:A][cf:B][cn:C]C[I don't really like to play a lot of moves on just one side, but I thought that I have to put some kind of pressure on white.

Well, many choices here, approaching the corners at A, B or C are some possibilities.]
;W[nc];B[fc]LB[qf:A][lc:B]C[Playing Q14 or R13 was to passive in my opinion, but I guess a normal pincer would be normal.

Yes, responding at A or pincer at B is playable too.];W[df]
;B[lc];W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[Right direction?

Q14 is playable too, please study the variations.];W[od];B[oe]
C[Not sure about this one

Black P17 probably can't be considered.

White got the ladder and if you choose to capture the O17 stone, will give white a big fat corner.]
;W[oc]LB[md:A]C[Here, black A better, let white have the corner and make R14 lonely outside.]

(;B[pe];W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[md];B[ne];W[mc]LB[ic:A]C[I thought this result is OK for black. The M17 stone is hurt but I get nice thickness and sente

On the contrary, I think white is better.

White R14 is very much alive to me.

Here I would probably play black A next.];B[db];W[gc];B[gd]
;W[hd]LB[hc:A]C[Overplay by white.

Black just need to cut at A.];B[fd];W[ic]LB[hc:A]C[White to play A better.]
;B[cc];W[cd]SQ[df][dd]LB[ch:A]C[Here, white should play C11 or C10 instead of C16.

C16 itself actually make the 3 white stones look heavy.

Here, black A is very severe move.];B[cn]C[Direction?

Black C6 is probably a helping move, leading white to play C10 so naturally.]
;W[cj];B[cq]C[Jumping better ?];W[cp];B[dq]LB[ep:A]C[White A is better.]
;W[bq]C[I was surprised here];B[ep]LB[eq:A]C[Risky move, black E3 will do.

What if white cut at A?];W[eo];B[fp]C[You got really lucky here.]
;W[dn];B[ej]C[guess I'm afraid of moyos

Maybe J3 / K3 would be better?

Yeah, I would definitely play K3, there is no hurry to invade or start a fight, still early in the game.]
;W[qj]
(;B[qk]C[playng at r11 seemed like going along with whites plan

While actually, there is nothing wrong with black R11...];W[pk]
LB[ql:A][qi:B][ok:C]C[Anything wrong with playing black A?

You got black B (2nd line capture) and C (ladder in your favour) miai.]
;B[rk];W[qi];B[pl];W[ok];B[qm];W[oi]TR[qn][po][pe]C[This result is too good for white.

The marked stones are very light and can be easily sacrificed.

Now you can see Q15 is bad, it doesn't give you any eye-shape.]
;B[ol]LB[nk:A]C[White A is the right shape here.];W[oj];B[rb]
C[playing aroundK4/L4 looked big but my group in the top right started to fell heavy, so I was trying to get some eye space

Good move.];W[kq];B[mq]C[direction? j3 better?

Yes, black J3 is the correct direction.

You should always place your stone nearer to the weaker side driving towards the stronger side.]
;W[hq]C[Pretty painful for black...];B[br]LB[bp:A]C[White should play A unconditionally.]
;W[fr]C[Bad move from white.];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq];W[co]LB[eq:A]
[eh:B][ch:C][ml:D]C[Here, the cut at A isn't that big as both white groups are already alive.

Even if white were to capture E4 and F4, it is merely some 7-8 points.

I would tenuki here, play B to exchage for C and go for D the big move.]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[ho];W[cm]C[Very slow move.];B[ci]C[Overplay.]
;W[di];B[dj]LB[dh:A]C[White should play A.];W[bj]LB[dh:A]C[Black should ladder at A.

Both sides played very badly here.]
(;B[he];W[ie];B[dh];W[ch];B[ei];W[bh]
(;B[jd]LB[hf:A][ge:B][id:C]C[Here, white should play A to exchange for B then stick at C.]
;W[je]C[Clearly, white flopped here and this is the game.];B[id]
;W[hc];B[jc]LB[hf:A]C[Even if white  were to lose the semeai, atari at A is a must.]

C[Game over to me here, black has won the game.

I shall end my review here.

Some notes for you, you have to pay more attention,

1) the direction of play
2) severity of cut, always ask yourself what if your opponent cut here, sacrifice some stones or pick up a fight (in short to kill or be killed)

Hope my advice can improve your game and you do enjoy my review.]
