I think N8 should be playable. The W group is weak, so if W invades between=

(;B[mo]SQ[lq]LB[lq:A][lo:B][mn:C]C[>should have I gone under? like M3?

I think you must keep W separated here, at any rate. A sacrifice at A (M3) =
is one way. See variations.

Attaching above at B (M5), or at C (N6), are also ideas to keep W separated=
. The trouble with pushing into a diagonal jump, as you do with N5, is that=
 it can lead to bad shape.];W[nq]

A, so White can fight with more confidence in the centre than he otherwise =
might be able to.

White has at least come out of the fight with sente.];W[rd]
C[I think this manouvre is too early: if W wants to mess around in your big=
 right-hand area, he's just made you stronger.

White needs to decide what to do with his lower-right group. It looks like =
he can either make it live, or force a way out into the centre. Making Blac=
k stronger like this is only going to make that harder.];B[re]
;W[rc];B[qf]C[Good. You've gained more in thickness than White has in territory.]
;W[qi]LB[rk:A]C[>How to respond to this?

This seems like a good idea from White, to try to stir up some trouble near=
 his mostly-dead group. He's threatening to attach under at A (S9), so it m=
ight be best just to play there, or S8, yourself. That ought to kill his bo=
ttom-right group cleanly, and his invading stone will end up very deep in y=
our framework with no real weaknesses to aim at.];B[pj]C[Good move. It stops W connecting under.]
;W[mh];B[oh]SQ[mn][kh]C[>This seems too defensive. Please suggest a variation. I considered N6 or=
 L12

I would play L12. If he makes a living group here, his bottom-right will de=
finitely be dead, and you will have thickness to invade as much as you like=
 on the left.

N6 would remove White's aji in the centre, and make it much harder for him =
to do anything with his bottom-right group, but I think it's probably too p=
assive.

As it is, W can treat N12 as a good reducing move, and leave it alone for n=
ow.];W[mn];B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[ro];B[rl]C[I think this is the strongest move, to stop White getting two eyes.]

;W[cd];B[dg]SQ[eh][ei]C[> Is this good, should it be at E11 or E12?

I think once you've played this approach, you have to carry on and make a t=

much of the centre. With your move in the game, you're strong everywhere an=
d can begin to see a really big territory in the centre.

If you're not going to play H16, I think G16 is a mistake. But yes, this wa=
