C[jluebke: I'm playing white (jluebke).  Thanks for taking a look at my game!

General comments:

- There were quite many completely unnecessary moves in this game. Meaning that instead of playing that move one could just as well pass and let the opponent play twice in a row. It is obviously important to realize about those.

- You should focus on getting some idea about close range fighting and about life and death (ie. when is a group of stones doomed to be captured and when is it save). This also means try to read out the continuations of your moves as far as possible.

- It is generally important to spend some time to think about what is actually going on on the board. It is no good to play somewhere, just because your opponent plays there. When you are unsure where to play ask yourself: Are there any important stones of mine which can be captured/killed if I don't add a stone there? Are there any important stones of my opponent which can be captured/killed if I play there?
Also if your opponent plays somewhere make sure this really changes anything about the situation, before adding a defensive move.

- Maybe consider playing also on a smaller board (ie 13x13 or even 9x9), things happen more quickly there and it is easier to realize that a certain group is dead and why that happened or why a couple of stones were captured.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dd];B[jp];W[mp]TR[jd][dj][pj]C[jluebke: Probably too early to make this move -- I assume I should have taken one of the other star points instead...


Anyway it is not a move that I often see in any games at all... Playing at one of the star points would have been save. Don't worry about these opening moves too much though. Strange things sometimes happen there between strong players...]

;B[np]C[So far things happened in the lower left corner, no black goes back to your N4 stone. Are his stones around C4 safe from attack through? It might be more important to attack them, than to defend your N4 stone. After C2 black cannot make two eyes in the corner, which would force his group to run away.
Defending as you did is not necessarily bad either, but consider these things.]
;W[lo];B[pj];W[dj];B[cr]C[Now black takes that point, which not only strentghening his group, but also threatens the D3 stones, which black can now capture if white doesn't defend.]

(;W[bo];B[bp];W[cs];B[fq]C[Now there is the attack (however with a strange move ;)]
;W[eq]C[This move is very bad. Should really be at E4. In any case these stones are in trouble now, which could have easily been avoided.]
;B[bs]C[Strange move. The C1 stone is almost completely irrelevant to the white stones. Should immediately have been black E4.]
;W[ds]C[Now you missed the chance to run away. Don't defend something, just because your opponent thinks it is important to attack it. Maybe there is something better you can do. In this case try to save the bigger part of your group.]
;B[ep]C[Now the group is dead and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. All the moves black and white make from now on in relation to this group are wasted.]

(;W[fp];B[eo]C[black has to answer]
(;W[fo];B[er]C[jluebke: This suprised me at the time -- this group is now dead...

black doesn't have to make this move though...];W[ap];B[es]
C[neither this one. your stones can't run away.];W[en];B[aq]
;W[ao]C[Now you should ask yourself if this A4 stone was really that important? I don't think so. The upper side is all open (K16 maybe?) Your N4 group might need help, but trying to save A4 is small, very small.

Also there is the threat of C7, which is very severe. Also defending at F6 against the coming black attack would be better.]

No he should play at M6 to save his M7 stones and capture your M5 stones.]

C[jluebke: It seemed to me like I should have been able to capture some territory in this corner, but instead it all goes to black.  Any suggestions would be appreciated...


You need make sure that your groups have a chance to run away or make two eyes to live. You just placed your stones into black territory desperately tring to capture some black stones. Your stones were in a bad position all the time and eventually captured.]

if black would take the key point right now, there is no way white can ever live (see var).]

It is very important that you try to read out what can happen in such situations. Once again you and your opponent were all crazy about some stones on the first line, when there was a key point which *no* stronger player would ever miss.]
;W[sb]
