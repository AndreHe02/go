C[Dear reviewer,

I played as black in this game. The result of this game was White+Resign.

It didn't appear to me that i was putting enough thought into my moves. I also think there were things i wasn't seeing or noticing on the board.

Any advise on how to take better care of my groups would be most appreciated.

                                                                  Thanks,
                                                                                  Travis


Dear Travis,

I reviewed this game and think you started losing the game  in the early middle fight.
The main problem was you understimated the thickness of your opponent's wall in the lower side. The invasion in the lower side was totally lost. Thereafter, it was easy for white to dictate the game.

You made a large capture later on, but W was way ahead. You again allowed W to invade and win many more points in the lower left corner.

At this stage, I suggest you do more tesuji problems to see how to connect and cut sones, so that you can build up better shapes when you play. 

All the best,

whose wall? do you mean black's wall far away in the upper left corner? B101 is standing alone very bold against white's massive thickness in the lower right side.]
