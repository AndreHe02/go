;B[qf]LB[de:a]C[Perhaps a move at 'a' is more large scale. The move played is not a bad move, but is somewhat boring to my  subjective taste.]

C[R11 feels too
soon. Would P9 have been better?

MP: I am thinking of 'a' at O10, as a way of keeping control over the center and attacking the marked stones. White cannot hope to save more than one set of white stones.]

C[The attack
seem to have lost most of its effect. M9 is played to test white's
response.

MP If you think white is strong M9 is to close to that strength. There is a risc that this move is left hanging in the center doing no work...]
;W[nl]C[..because of this move.];B[om];W[mh];B[li]C[This make black slightly heavy and it is questionable if it is black who attacks white or the opposite]
;W[lh];B[ji];W[kh];B[ij];W[md];B[oc];W[ig]LB[hd:a][jf:b]C[White should perhaps have  tried the inducing strategy of white 'a', black 'b' and then this move
would be very severe];B[kf]LB[gc:a]C[This could easily become a thank you move - that is a move that helps white to play a move white otherwise would not have time to play. I think black should play a move like 'a'.]
;W[je]C[This is odd.];B[kd];W[mf];B[ke];W[jh]C[It seems like black gained more in this move sequence after all.]
;B[mc]C[I thought the attack was over, so I decided to
settle L16 group. Now D15 is open for black to play.];W[ki]
;B[de]C[I considered white to be safe already, so I did not see any point in holding on to the black stones in the center.]

;W[ip];B[hp]LB[ho:a]C[If White responds with 'a' this could become an outright loss.]
;W[hq];B[jp]C[This also seem to risc more than its worth];W[io]
;B[jo];W[jq];B[in];W[jn];B[ho];W[iq]C[I am not
really sure if either side handled the moves starting with H4 very
well.];B[jm]C[This seems a little vulgar. H6 or H7 better?

MP: Sacrifice without regret. It is hard to tell, perhaps black should try to get sente - but it is unclear to me if that would be wise or even possible.]
;W[kn];B[hm]LB[in:a][kj:b]MA[kn][nl]C[Compare this result with playing 'a' immediately.
Black is building in a direction whre a big hole is left at 'a'. And the two marked white stones may connect rather easily in the future, and definitely cut off the black center. Thus black is thin and white is slightly thicker if you watch carefully.]
;W[il];B[im];W[jj];B[km];W[ln];B[lm];W[rp]C[Odd timing];B[ro]
;W[rq];B[rn];W[ii];B[hc]LB[fm:a][bh:b]C[This is a big extension, but maybe the urgent
point was to protect the black center group? I thought I would be able to pull it out safely.

MP: True, this is big, but can black connect to the left? And  how big is a move like White 'a' if it is played in sente? And how much trouble can white 'b' cause?]
;W[mm];B[mn];W[kp]LB[lo:a]C['a' is better (nitpicking)];B[dl]
C[Good idea - if it works :-)];W[fl];B[hl];W[gj];B[ik]LB[fm:a]
[co:b]C[I have the feeling that black 'a' is the urgent point here since it it also aims at 'b', it is safe since it threaten to connect and als big becauseit make white territory impossible there.]
;W[gn]C[Seems slow, G6.

MP: Yes, never threaten to cut off two unimportant stones in a fight. But it is better than that because it does attack black and defend the only weak spot White had. it might be greedy though because the shape is thin if black can live.]
;B[hj]
(;W[gk]LB[fm:a]C[This is a good move, but black should also keep the counter 'a' in mind]
;B[hi];W[fh];B[hg];W[qh];B[rh];W[qg];B[rg];W[pf];B[pg]LB[ph:a]
[og:b][qe:c]C[This must be bad.  If white 'a' then white 'b' will make instant life. And worse is that if white do not need life then the exchange whit white 'c' would ruin a lot of black points]
;W[ph];B[pe]LB[pg:a]C[... ok the move at 'a' was not that bad thanks to this move]

big I could not believe I got this point. Then again - it may be  hard for
white to do much more than reduce here.];W[fe];B[ff];W[of];B[mk]
;W[qc]C[Must be played in hope of a black
mistake.];B[pb];W[qb];B[qd];W[hn]C[H6 bigger than N9?

MP: Black H6 would have better aji but it perhaps only worth a point or two unless something unexpected happens later.]
