illyriak [7k\]: hf];B[pq];W[dc];B[cn]C[this move is not a mistake.
however, please consider that opening theory says that an "unbalanced" corner is worth more than a balanced one (i.e. 3-3 and 4-4 points are balanced, others are not).]
;W[fq];B[ck]C[C9 is a mistake, you must slide into the corner first, except in very exceptional circumstances. W may C5 now immediately.]
;W[ce];B[qo];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[hc]C[H17 is a bad move because it makes o15 a bad exchange.

It would be better to play h17 immediately instead of O15 first.

Instead of O15 or H17, playing R17 would be another option.

If you play O15, playing L16 next is important.];B[le];W[ng]
;B[qi];W[he];B[jq]C[K3 is ignoring the urgent point of M13, if W plays there B is more in trouble than W.]
;W[ci];B[fe]C[B must slide at b4 to make a base, or he will have trouble living.]
;W[gf];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg];W[ee];B[de];W[ed];B[cf]C[W captured the F15 stone, but has lost much influence on the outside, this is a loss for W.]

;B[bp];W[cq];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[be];W[dl]C[D8 is the usualy shape move, it helps protect the cut from B D10]
;B[cl];W[dm];B[mp];W[co];B[bo];W[cm];B[bm];W[bn]C[B6 is a total loss.]

;B[ap];W[cj];B[bk];W[dn];B[bn]C[I think that group couldn't be killed, but i thought i could get a good position just trying it. did i miss any move?

Mainly not playing the throwin, pressuring the group to live was good for W.]

;B[oj]C[I let black build a totally huge territory and i still can't find where i failed, should i had played tenuki early or made a invasion?

I think you did not punish B for his mistakes, such as not capping the group on the top, or kicking the lower right group. Also capturing the F15 stone gave B extra influence (even if he did not use it very well.

B got to tenuki and was not punished for it, and so he built a very large territory.]
