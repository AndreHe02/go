C[Hi, thanks for review my game.
I played this game in a tournament on kgs, i was black.

I felt that i was playing good, but my position in the late game had some weaknes, and i think that i lost the game because of it.

Please, review fot both sides. Thanks

Dieter: You played a good opening. If you manage to keep your advantage by patient attacking & defending, and to maintain your confidence by regularly estimating the global position and count, I believe you will win more games.

Don't invade potential territory too early.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp]
;W[dc];B[oq];W[nc];B[qf];W[jd];B[de]C[Is this the better approach?

dv: I see no problem.];W[cg];B[ef];W[fd]
(;B[dh]C[Here, i choosed to not do the joseki. It was a good idea?

Dieter: As described on the http://senseis.xmp.net/?BQM209 page, this IS one of the Rui Nawei joseki continuations.]
;W[ch]C[However, White now derails.];B[di];W[cj];B[cc];W[cb]
;B[cd]C[dv: very good moves until now.];W[dd]LB[bb:A][eb:B]
[fc:E][hc:D][cf:C]C[According to me this is a bad move. Defensive move at A or aggressive move at B are common. White tries to patch his weakness in a threatening fashion, but he removes his liberties in the process.

Black can play C and later aim at the invasion at D, with the weakness of white's shape at E in mind.]
;B[ci];W[ck]C[This move is completely nonsensical.];B[bi]CR[cg]
[ch]SQ[cj][ck]C[Black obviously cuts through. White's mistake is one of 15-20 kyu level. I don't mean this as an insult, but to say that it renders the previous analysis futile, so overwhelmingly good is Black's position now.

The circled stones are captured. The squared ones are without value.]

(;W[bb]
(;B[be]C[I think i'm overconcentrated.

dv: Not playing here would leave the variation. I believe this makes a clean capture.]
;W[qk]
(;B[qi]C[Is this the right direction??
I thought if i choose the other side, the result would not be good for me. Am i right?

dv: Frankly, I cannot confirm this. Your variation looks perfectly ok to me.]

(;W[pb]
(;B[lc]C[Again, i did not wanted to give him a chance to play O15.

dv: This invasion is premature. White has failed to play R6 so you must punish him for that. You can allow O15: the upper side is all he's got!! See var.]
;W[ne]C[dv: Now O15 is a double purpose move. So I think you helped him here.]
;B[le];W[qc];B[qm]C[Is this move good, or i should just defend? Or maybe tenuki?

dv: I believe this move is very good, for the aforementioned reasons, although now you have two groups at the top to take care of.]
;W[ng];B[lg];W[rj]

;B[pn];W[om];B[nj]C[This move caused me some trouble later, because the weaknes at N12. What move is better here?

dv: I see the peep, but see no problem with it. This move is perfectly ok.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[ld]C[dv: White is really asking for trouble with such moves.]
;B[md];W[kd];B[mc];W[nd];B[me]C[This is like trying to cut a bamboo.]
;W[jb]
(;B[hd]C[Here, i wanted to seal in this group, and then, i would had some moyo. Any sugestions?

dv: An aggressive move, which can take care of your top group in an active fashion. However, see var.]
;W[hc]
(;B[gd]C[dv: This is a bad move. You allow hane at the head of two. If you anything here, you must cut.]
;W[gc];B[jf]C[I sealed in the white group, but my opponent had sente.
What move i did not saw to this happen?

[qq][rq][sq][pr][qr][rr][sr][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[After this move, i felt that i was behind. How i should play here?

dv: You are not behind at all. Let's count.

Black has 2x14 points = ca 30
White has15+7+7,5 points = ca 30

White has a weak group. Black's groups in the top right should still be connected, but are not weak.

White has potential for development at the bottom. Black has sente. The game looks equal to me.]
;B[fq]C[I played this move with the intention of atack the K4 stone if he answer at f3, and try do seal in the left group whit the sequence i did. This move was good? Or i should played another move?

dv: This move is completely natural. White's weak group at the right will be exposed.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn]LB[lp:A]C[Black A will now launch a double attack.]
;B[eo];W[do]C[dv: This is a thank you move. White's weakness is removed, while the black move contributes little.]
;B[fm];W[jm];B[el];W[dl]C[My formation it is not very good here.

dv: Indeed. White receives a lot of territory in return for influence which is not easy to apply.]
;B[lq]C[Good! Although I would play one line higher.];W[lp]

(;B[kq]C[Is this move right?
dv: No the hane is natural, see var.];W[kp];B[ik]TR[lr][nr]

[bq][cq][ar][br][cr][as][bs][cs]C[Here, i thought i was winning, but i still have some weaknes. What i should do to defend this weaknes and win the game?

dv: In comparison with the previous evaluation, White has made 18 points extra, and Black 7. In addition, White's weak group on the right has received support from the bottom centre stones.

Black has some potential centre territory, but it is difficult to see how it can grow large. I believe White is now ahead.

Black has two opportunities still: find an attack on the weak group. Or find a way to invade the left territory, which is almost secure.]
