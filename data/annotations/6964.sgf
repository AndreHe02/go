AB[dd][pp]C[Cook777: Hi, Most people do not care for the endgame so I was hoping you leave some comments for it. Not saying that is what I like the focus to be on. Just not to forget it because it is endgame. I like to inprove in all things. :)


This game is decided in the middle-game, so anything after middle game is just for reference.
To improve, i would suggest doing more tsumego to train your reading abilities, and read up books on sabaki and strategical plays, as your whole board thinking is a bit lacking.
You endgame moves are mostly ok so i think this is why people do not have many comments for it.]
