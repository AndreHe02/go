C[To the reviewer: Hello, I've recently played a couple of games against san-ren-sei with horrific results, this is the worst of the two. I'd like some advice in this situations and a remark of my own mistakes as well. I'll precede my comments with "L:"

here S6 is better and make sure life for your stones in the corner]
;B[rn]
(;W[lp]C[L: I played this to get to the outside and somehow stress the K4 stone. Is this right ? Is there something better, like playing L3 first?
-- comment --
as you have not played R3 before , it's a hard way to go against a thik wall

you have all the goban to build , and in an even game no possibility to majke big points here

the way if you want attak next here is to build on the left edge near D6 F3, F4 , and after making a base , go on to pressure black.
It's to soon to attak specially with no  base

it's too easy to black to deprive you for a base];B[rl];W[ln]

as explained before, with no base, you have now to escape to the center]

this arrive because of you attak witout a base];B[di];W[ci]

-- comment ---
i don't know 
but i think, K16 is better with no black wall in the center. so solidly is a good idea in this case]

this is not a good idea

your stones are still weak and black can rob the top by K18]

;B[pi];W[qi];B[pj];W[ph];B[nh];W[lg]C[L: I tried to reduce black's influence, but it didn't work

-- it's very hard to make  points in the center, so the purpose of black was not to make points , but to reduce your territories]
