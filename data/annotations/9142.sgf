AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,
I played Black in a two-stone handicap game which I lost by about 20 points.  I suspect I was doing pretty well until I made a thoughtless tenuki from an urgent situation at move 88, and then got very flustered at White's (very sensible) response.

So I'm interested in corrections at least up through move 88 or thereabouts -- tactical blunders, overlooked big points, wrong direction of play -- and then anything you think is worth saying past that point: i.e. could I have extracted myself from the mess?
Did I overlook reasonable continuations?

I have included a number of specific questions at particular moves, as well as comments about what I thought I was accomplishing.

Thank you!

Comments by Az];W[cd];B[pp];W[ec];B[cj]C[Largest side; play low because W is low?

Az: Its fine.];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[qj]C[Too slow?  Bottom is large too, I know, But I wanted the shimari reinforced at least from one end.

Az: It's fine.];W[nq];B[lq]C[Pincer too close?

Az: I think its ok. You have many reasonable ok moves in the beginning.]
;W[no];B[pn];W[fq];B[hq]LB[iq:b][jq:a]C[Should it have been at B so as not to invite an invasion at A?

Az: Yes. For an even game I think this is would be ok, but for handicap especially I'd prefere 'b'.]
;W[jq]
(;B[jr]LB[nm:c][lo:a][ip:b]C[Seemed like the only move -- would like to have played should I have played at A and then B; but he would
have responded at C, maybe, and then I would be busy with my right-side stones.

Az: I would prefer to jump out with A, this is a bit submissive and ignores the fact that white is weak here too.]

C[Reasonable sequence?];W[np];B[pr]C[Close my corner and keep him shapeless.

Az: This has good flow, black can play this way.];W[mr];B[ls]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[gp]
(;B[ko]C[Got worried about some hypothetical sequence of cuts.

Az: This makes no sense. If you want to defend the group (which is ok) you should play J6]
;W[nm];B[pl];W[cn]TR[ip][jp][kq][lq]C[Here I wasn't sure how to respond
-- I didn't want to have him lean on my lower left corner and strengthen his bottom group enough to turn around and go after my thin-looking triangled bottom group.

Az: You should treat the corner lightly, w is very thick nearby. Passing with L5 looks extra bad now :(]

(;B[co]C[Az: Heavy! Link up your stones, this is ugly and has no purpose here.]
;W[en];B[do]C[I was reading about this joseki recently and thought I'd try it
-- somehow I didn't give enough thought to the possibility of a 3-3 invasion.]
;W[em]
(;B[bn]C[Az: If you must atari at least play the other one.]
;W[cm];B[bm]C[I thought I'd be able to connect out in an emergency.]
;W[km];B[jm]C[Keep him separated from his left side stones.

Az: You are starting to look weak so you can't go all out here. This is ok, but your chance to play very strongly against his group in the lower right has passed. Its hard to find a good move for black, L7 is very painful.]

(;B[qh];W[qi];B[ri]C[Should I have made atari from above?

Az: You should have never played r12, but if you must then the other atari is much better.]
;W[qg];B[pi];W[pg];B[ni]C[Keep the two W groups separated.]
;W[qc]C[Wasn't sure how to respond.

Az: Kill the big white group, right now. Your 2 are light, you can decide how to handle them later, tenuki for a move won't hugely change things.]

(;B[pc];W[rd];B[qd];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[qf]C[Keep him separated---]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[pb];B[nf]LB[qa:b][ob:a][oc:c]C[Poor move?      I was worried about my little group and didn't want to lose sente with B at A, W at B, then B at C.   This seemed to make sure his 4 stones had no wiggle room.

Az: A-C is straight out of the question, thats endgame (or almost endgame) now. This is more reasonable.]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[cl];B[al];W[ch]LB[cj:a]TR[ef]C[Here I should have immediately made a base for the lower left corner group, or started running with the marked stone (but that would have induced him to make territory in the vicinity of the triangle?), but all I noticed was that
he was acquiring a moyo.  So ...

Az: Even if you want to invade you picked a terrible spot. You should reduce his moyo if this is worrying you,]

(;B[lc]C[I succumbed to the classic sin of "jealousy" and made an ill-timed invasion.

Az: Ill timed, and ill placed. This area is small because of P18 option.]
;W[cq]C[Naturally!]
(;B[cr]C[Terrible move -- panic -- but nothing I could read out seemed to work any better.

Did W88 kill any possibility of eyes in the corner?

Az: Short answer: pretty much. You could play b4 for an eye but its better to make white live small and connect out since that way would cost you many points.]
;W[dq];B[bq]C[Az: I have absolutely no idea what black is thinking here, this obviously fails.]
;W[bp];B[bo]C[Az: ... thats not an eye.];W[br];B[dh]C[Try to do something on the outside.]
;W[ci];B[dj];W[di];B[ej]TR[hl][il][jl]C[Reach the marked stones?]

[np][nq][mr]C[Wanted to keep the captured group contained in a sizeable area,
but an onlooker told me later I was crazy not to play at A, and endure whatever pushing W was going to do.

Az: Actually you were crazy not to play B, followed by A.];W[gi]
;B[gh]C[Az: Do you have a deathwish? Its easy to save your group if you want to.]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[eg];B[fg];W[fi]
(;B[hg]C[Az: This looks like it could be the losing move. I understand you wanted to capture w on a big scale, but you have a lot of stones hanging in the balance. C13 looks like you still live - this is your last chance.]
;W[ff];B[gg]LB[gk:a]C[Better move? (Saved the stone so that I would have a forcing move at A; but I never used it...)

Az: I don't understand most of b's play for the last 15 moves. Of course this isn't the most important move.]
;W[cg];B[hc]C[Maybe catch up if I can destroy his top?  Or should I already have resigned?

Az: Don't resign until you're really sure. In this case however, H16 looks better since you can use your thickness effectively and w is hard put for an answer.]
;W[jc];B[he];W[ld]
(;B[lg]C[Too passive?

Az: Yes. You still could have done something on the top, m13 was the losing move. See variation.

Overall you played pretty well, I'm surprised if you're a 3k. Your big mistake wasn't that you didn't defend the LL from 3-3 point, but that you gave up on it for dead when you could have easily saved it. Even after that you had a chance up top, but I think you'd mentally given up and accepted that you were gonna lose.

End of comments.];W[if]C[So B122 ened up not enclosing anythng anyhow...]

Anyhow, sorry about my poor play in the second half; thank you for your comments.]
