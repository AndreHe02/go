AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[This
is another Gnu Go game (I've been playing live opponents more now, but in
playing Gnu Go I can leave the game up while I work and make moves occasionally).

This game I lowered my handicap from 9 to 6 stones and I can beat Gnu Go about 50% of the time at that level.

I'd
like some general information about my proposed strategies during the game
and information about "Big points" I missed.  Suggestions for areas I need
to work on are always welcome!

My warmest thanks for you time and experience!];W[fq];B[cn]
C[I chose C6 to avoid a double wing formation by white.

With D10 you have astrong position, i prefer a move at D6.]
;W[dr];B[jq]C[White
committed himself to attacking the corner so I played K3 as a pincer against
the white group and an extension from Q4.

This move don't follow the rule :  corners, sides and center.
I prefer C3.];W[pm];B[mq]C[Q7 looked to
be placed as to invade the loose framework on the bottom. I was trying to
cover the looseness of my stones.];W[nm];B[nj]C[White's jump to O7 was
pretty odd.  I was expecting the computer to go back toward the corner (maybe
R5).  Since I already was ahead on the bottom, I decided to go ahead and
follow on the top.];W[dg];B[jd]C[I was tired of answering splitting plays (GNU go always starts this way... with spliting stones on each side.

Since D13 didn't seem to need an immediate answer, I tried K16 which put me closer to a 7 stone handicap.]
;W[md]C[Ugh... Again with the splitting attacks.]
(;B[nd]C[This time I decided just to attack head on. :-)
If you want to attack, don't attach the stone, P17 is better.]
;W[pg]C[So
white double-wings my corner. Grrr...];B[qf]C[I dove under to connect the
corner to the group on the right-center and look at preventing white from
trying to hook up underneath around R10.];W[lm];B[io]C[White moved to
jump ahead and my bottom group was loosing access to the center.  This play
looked like a good way to get the lower right group out into the center and
split white F3 and N7.

your lower right group is strong, i think h4 is better, it attack F3 and split also the 2 white groups.]
;W[jm];B[im]C[White just kept on running so I
bonked him on the head.  I thought D2 and F3 were looking pretty lonely about
now.  They still had the corner, though.

Don't attach stone when you attack, only for defense.];W[jl]
;B[jj]C[OK.. White didn't
like being bonked on the head, but I got him turned.  Now I'll step in front
of him to keep him from carrying his influence into the top.]
;W[fg]C[He didn't like that.  He spreads his influence];B[ng]
C[I
don't remember what I was thinking here.  I belive it's a splitting attack
against the two loose white stones that are deep in my sphere of influence.]
;W[mb];B[jc]C[I
thought that white's next move would be to make a base and take a chunk out
of the upper, left corner.  I wasn't sure if this was strong enough (as N18
is lower) but it seemed to mesh well with O16.];W[nc];B[oc]
C[This is
a mirror play.  He makes a tiger's mouth so I make a tiger's mouth.  Should
be hard for him to connect N16 and Q13.];W[lc]C[I've heard that Ponuki
are bad.  I figured this was an eye to fight against my eyeless group. It
didn't seem like an immediate threat, however, so I decided to Tenuki.]
;B[hq]C[This
looked to be the last "big point"  It was an extension from K3 and gave me
eye shape with K3 and J5.  I also thought of it as attacking D2 and F3.

I see four urgent point; the corners C17 or F17, C3, R3 or R6, R17
The corners are big.  There is a proverb : If you lost four corners : resign.]
;W[hg]C[Hmmm....  Trying to connect up with the ponuki?];B[lf]
C[This move hems in the ponuki and keeps it away from H13.

G17 or F17];W[ob]C[GnuGo
likes to play this game where it litters stones in a checkerboard.  I always
loose that fight.  I try my own checkerboarding with a double tiger's mouth.]
;B[pb];W[na]C[Now white is making eyes to live on the upper side.  I just let it go.]
;B[pa]C[This move I wasn't sure about.  Seems it could have been a tenuki?]
;W[kb];B[jb]C[White expands to the other side and I protect the upper-left corner area.]
;W[la]C[White
finishes his checkerboard and I start worrying about the line of stones on
row 13 stabbing into the space I've been protecting on the top.]
;B[gd];W[il];B[hm]C[I wasn't sure how to respond to white's crawl, but I figured that staying ahead of him was probably OK.]
;W[kp]C[Now white is making eye space and stabbing toward my lower area.  I defended]
;B[kq];W[jn]C[Threatening a cut or just linking up to L4?];B[in]
C[Bad shape, H5 is better];W[fo];B[fm]C[White finally made a move to pull out F3 and D2 so I tried bonking that on the head.]
;W[br];B[hj]C[He stretches into the corner as expected so I move to split J8 and H13.]
;W[oo];B[op]C[Now I'm having to defend both the right and bottom edges at once.  Ick.]
;W[mo]C[This
didn't seem to need an immediate response but then I thought about it pushing
through at O3.  That didn't sound good so I tried to prevent that.]
;B[nq];W[jg]C[More
with the pushing on the top.];B[ql]C[Now I'm moving to expand the base of
my row 10 central line on this side while, at the same time, cutting off
the base of white's lower right central group.];W[ei]C[More eye space stabbing.]
;B[ej];W[ce];B[cd];W[bg]C[This doesn't look like I need to respond to it right away.  Tenuki.]
;B[bp]C[Trying to form eye space with C6 and protect against invaders from the corner.]
;W[qm];B[pl]C[This
move I wasn't sure about.  I've seen it in lots of games (where you just
mirror your opponent's wall).  It also seemed to form more territory above
the stones so I went with it. I don't understand the reasoning behind it
very well, though.];W[rm];B[rl];W[bj];B[bk]C[Now white begins expanding
a base for his upper left group.  I blocked at B9, but I was thinking that
maybe B8 or C8 would be better.];W[cj];B[ck]C[Now I've created a cutting point that white can aim at with the stone at F5 or the stone at J8.]
;W[be]
(;B[dl]C[I protected the cutting point thinking that I could probably patch the upper corner reasonably easily later.

Not necessary, see variation];W[bd]
(;B[cc]C[Eeew.
 Bad shape.  Didn't notice that during the game.  Maybe C17 would have been
better?  I get cut all the time with diagonals close to the edge, though.]
;W[bc];B[bb];W[qq]C[Hmmm...
I'm really close to the wall at R7.  I've got a cutting point at P3.  I didn't
know if I should play R4 (cutting off the white stone.. possibly to have
it live in the corner or somewhere else.  I think I chickened out.

P3 is not a cutting point cause O4.
So if you play R4, White live in the corner.];B[pr];W[qp];B[pq]
;W[qr];B[gr]C[Mining attack to prevent white at H2.];W[cq];B[cp]
;W[fr];B[en];W[po];B[nl]C[This was supposed to be expanding my framework on the upper right.]
;W[me];B[ne];W[ps];B[os];W[qs];B[or];W[ml];B[om]C[I
thought this was pretty good... all it did was force me to have to connect...
again... at P8 later on.];W[sl];B[sk];W[sm];B[rj];W[on];B[ol]
;W[di];B[ef]C[I
was trying to inflate the top right as much as possible while peeking at
white's cutting points.];W[ff]C[it didn't work :-(];B[fe];W[mf]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[of];W[og];B[pf];W[qg];B[jf];W[if];B[ie];W[he]
;B[hd];W[kf];B[je];W[lg]
(;B[mh]C[Right
after I played this I thought... why am I trying to save those two stones.
 The best thing I can think of is that they are cutting off the three to
the right of them from the living group on the top right.

Bad shape,.];W[lh];B[lj]C[Keeping white's top and bottom separated as much as possible.]
;W[mi];B[mj];W[nh]C[So much for keeping the top and right sides separated.  Big mistake on my part!]

;W[jo];B[go];W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[bo];W[eq]C[I usually spend the end game entirely on the defensive.  I need to work on that :-(

Yeah, my endgame is poor too, so i try to play only sente move first, and after the big gote move.]
;B[dq];W[mk];B[nk];W[hk];B[gk];W[fn];B[gm];W[np];B[nr];W[lk]
;B[kk];W[kl];B[mm]C[This was a forcing move... I was threatening to capture N8 etc... I was trying to get back the initiative.]
;W[mn];B[ik]C[My big chance and I blew it trying to make a measly point.  Maybe L17 or H14 would have been better?

L17 and H14 as no chance to make something.
You have A19 and the game is finish.];W[jk];B[ij];W[kc];B[gp]
;W[sh];B[mg]C[This was a threat to cut off P13 and his friends.]
;W[ng];B[es]C[Similar threat against F1];W[er];B[gf]C[Cut off G15, H15?

No chance.];W[hf];B[aa]C[Cut off A18?];W[ac];B[ds]C[Again... cut off F1 and friends?]
;W[cs];C[The
end...  I lost by four points which makes me think all my forcing moves at
the end were a waste of resources and time.  Grrr.

Protect your corners when you play with handicap.  Don't try to split white groups without make territory.]
