AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,
   I'm Anand and I'm about 9kyu on IGS.

In this game I let black get away with too much territory on the top and in the center left. Any suggestions would be good.

*Hi Anand. Bill here.

I'm not going to jump all over every little mistake in fighting here.  When I do a review I try to find things where a small change in thinking will lead to a big improvement in results.

Lets see this game.*];W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj];B[rd]C[Should I protect by playing P15 or something?

*I would say no.  One of the things you'll find out as you progress is that going for territroy early is usually a bad idea.  I know that guys in your rank range, and I was no exception, are like 'If I can't count it it doesn't exist' !

There is a time for that kind of thinking but the very opening phase isn't it.  Right now your concern should be getting stones placed in all areas of the board especially since you gave a handicap.   I wouldnt have even done Q-10 myself.

I know its a standard kind of shape but it emphasizes the right side before we even know if it is going to be worth emphasizing. *]
;W[fq]C[*good*];B[dn];W[jp];B[ph]C[I don't think this is correct by black, R12 seemed more severe.

*What this is is way premature.  it's not a matter of correctness or severness on the local level its a matter of playing a small attack when he outght to be playing in open areas.  tenuki and make a third corner encloseure would be consistant, this just invites a fight that probably won't benefit him.*]

;W[pk];B[rj];W[rm];B[rg];W[rf];B[si];W[oh];B[sg]C[I am happy with the result, a nice thick wall.

*You should be overjoyed with this result.  Clearly your opponent chose the wrong direction for this fight. not only that he's handed you sente on a silver platter with one of those little cocktail umbrellas in it by making life when he already had it. 

Knock this one far out of the park.*];W[cf]LB[ii:A]C[* I don't like this placement.  you almost encourage him to cut this stone off from the influence of the wall.  Here I would take the less followed path and play  at or around A.

I know I know... How did I ever get 3k playing like that!  Everyone knows you approach with a keima.  EVERYONE!!

Well believe it or not A is logical and principled here:

1) its a well known proverb that playing on the border of conflicting moyos is high priority. 
2) this move threatens to make about 1/3 of the board into points if black desn't start attackingyour moyo.  We like this becuase it gives us the initiate and makes him have to respond to us.
3) the fact that this stone works so well with that wall means that attacks along the top side and left side now benefit greatly from the wall's presence.  It's like that stone channels the power of the wall to the middle and radiates it outward to the top and left.
4) it's just a damn cool move. :-D*];B[cd];W[fc]C[Is this double approach good?

*He's going to get a position in that corner one way or another.  Not sure what this is trying to accomplish.  This specific stone I think doesnt work terribly well with your lower stones like a 4th line approach would.*]
;B[ch];W[db]C[What about this? should I have played J17 or something?]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[fd];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc]C[*See how your little group is forced low?*]
;B[jc];W[hd];B[je];W[he]C[I wanted to preserve my access to the center, is this correct?

*Not a simple question but here is how I would approach it:

How much is it going to be worth to me if i get this group into the center? how much can my opponent gain by stopping it from getting there?

right now if he were to cut that group off you could play b17 and be just fine. So that said, you dont need to run to the middle with that group for defensive reasons, what about offense?  Is this move making threats he shouldn't ignore?  Is it making a lot of points or at least threatening to make a lot of points for you?

If the answer is no and no then you should find a better move that almost certainly exists.  I would say the central area is still just begging for a stone.*]
;B[ff]C[as predicted.];W[cl];B[dr];W[bn]C[Should I come out with F8?

* I would say F8 is much better yes.*];B[cm];W[bm];B[dl];W[ck]

;B[eo];W[ep];B[bp];W[fo];B[en];W[bh];B[bg];W[bi];B[cg]C[What is a good way to invade or erase the top?

*The top is written in premanent marker soaked in koo-aid dye.  They don't make a big enough eraser.*]
;W[fn];B[eq];W[fp];B[fr]
(;W[gr]LB[hj:A]C[*I like H10 here. 

 I gave a sample variation showing how these points you saved with this cover aren't really that valuable yet.  Learning not to consider moves like G2 automatic and needed immediately is critical to you improving.  Good players are always playing for sente and that means breaking off of expected continuations to play in bigger areas as much as possible. 

Making my wall a hero and his wall a zero here is just beyond important... way bigger than that cover.*]
;B[gs];W[hs];B[fs];W[hr]C[*again. this would have been a perfect time to tenuki to center. 

Your opponent would have jumped on that like a hobo on a $10 bill and you could have made 50 points while he groveled for 15.*]

;W[jn]C[* Haha, a baby step into the middle.  by now you know where I would have played.  F10 taking advantage of a bigish cut to place in the area you want is interesting too.]

;B[qd];W[oc];B[pc];W[od];B[oe];W[nc]C[* this is like a war movie.

Gen Anand: 'OK boys, you're going to be operating deep inside enemy territory.  Most of you won't be coming back alive.  And if you get caught, the white governement will disavow all knowledge of you.   Any Questions?

Pvt Whitestone: 'You make it sound so easy.' 

Gen Anand: 'Yeah yeah Whitestone.  Oh, and don't forget to get your Cyanide pill as you get out of the bowl.  Give 'em hell boys!'
