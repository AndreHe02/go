C[Hi, thank you in advance for your time.

This is one of my first games against human opponent and also using clock and it shows. My opponent was very aggressive and hot headed, so I tried to play further even after was pushed hard (move 60) and almost succeeded. Alas, I have no experience in invading, so still lost.

B: Hi, I'm Bart, around 6k and I'll try to review your game. My comments start with B.

Main questions are following:

1. Can I evade this contact play, which is seen through entire game? I feel, it was to my disadvantage and that quality of game itself dropped when I "agreed" to such style.

B: yes, you can. Hopefully I can show you some alternatives.

2. Can I somehow invade and live after 116? I know, I haven't tried, but any pointers?

B: see some variations at 118.

3. Is this normal for my opponent to just invade all out in the end, like he did? He was ahead after all.

B: no, maybe he or she didn't count, or just wanted to try and see if there was something more to gain. As long as you respond, it doesn't cost any points (he gives a stone, you place a stone in your own territory).]

(;B[cj]C[I feel this was my first big mistake. Should have played R6 or  similar.

B: not a very big mistake, but yes, the other side is more interesting right now. R6 would be a good approach.]
;W[qf]C[Is it to late now to play on right side?

B: no, but if white gets a move around P17 as well, your stone on R16 will be in a bit of trouble. So better to respond (as you did).]
;B[od];W[ck];B[di];W[bj];B[ci];W[bi]
(;B[bh]C[Would extension from d11 be better?

B: you have several choices here. See variations.];W[ei]
(;B[ej]C["What can go wrong", - I tought: "I can give two ataris, and move deeper to center. C12 group is strong enough to defend itself."

B: yes, your idea is good. I'd prefer the atari 1 line lower, so you can live on the side to make it easier. See variation.]
;W[dk]
(;B[fj]C[Was totally lost for next 40 moves. How should I play here?
Variation any better?

B: this looks ok. If white now plays E12 and you play F11, you have the variation. But if white plays E12 now, you'd rather play G12, which makes this a little more flexible than the variation.]
;W[fi]
(;B[hi]C[B: this is a mistake I think. If white pushes you with F11, it's usually ok to extend with G10. You're walking in front, which means more liberties for your group.]
;W[gj];B[fh];W[fk];B[gi];W[ek];B[eh];W[hj]
(;B[ij]C[B: same here. Better to play J11. More liberties and no cutting point.]
;W[ii]
(;B[ji]C[B: and usually better not to give atari to the cutting stone. Play K10 for instance and try to keep a bit of distance while capturing white.]
;W[ih]

;W[jh];B[ki];W[kj]
(;B[kh]C[B: I think I would prefer to stretch to M11.];W[kg]

(;B[jg]C[B: better to give your own stones more room first. For instance with N11.]
;W[ig];B[jf]C[B: yes, this could not be helped after the previous move. But it costs a lot. J14 is so good for white.]
;W[if]
(;B[hf]C[B: you cannot stop white after J14. Better to take some distance and defend from a bit further away. Or try to save your stones on the right.]
;W[ie];B[hd]C[B: better. And see previous comment.];W[je]
(;B[kf];W[lg];B[ke];W[lh];B[li]C[I was lost here, forgot to read.

B: yes, it happens.];W[mi];B[lj];W[lk]
(;B[qh]C[B: you can also get a 'free' move if you play a ladder breaker. See variation.]
;W[mj]C[B: but you get the move for free anyway :-)];B[qk];W[kd]

(;B[jd]C[B: try to see what happens after you give the atari. White will play M16. That puts your 4 stones in danger. An atari from the other side.]
;W[ld];B[me]C[At this moment I knew, that four stones are lost, so just tried defend right side.]
;W[le];B[md]
(;W[lf]C[B: white already has the stones, so he can play M17.]

(;B[pk]C[B: white can only atari 1 stone, so you can calmly play R6 first.]
