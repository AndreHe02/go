AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hi, I played B in this 3 stone handicap game, and lost by 9 points.  I made a painful and avoidable shortage of liberties blunder at around move 206
which caused a 10 point swing, but I'm confident that I made plenty of other errors all throughout the game.  I've included some specific questions, but I'd be grateful for any corrections, suggestions, etc., that you think I ought to see.

Thank you!

-Hi! I am Karen Ogg, AGA 1d and will do my best to point out all the issues I see.]
PL[W];W[po];B[dj]LB[qj:a]C[I've noticed that one of Michael Redmond's books recommends
playing B2 at A, if one does not enter into a 5-4 joseki.

- sure, but your move is just fine too. You take a big point.]
;W[fc];B[df]LB[hc:a]C[I usually pincer at A in such a position, but I wanted to do something different.  Too passive?

It is mostly stylistic difference. It is not bad, but I like the spirit one shows when pincering because it uses more of the handicap 'power' from your extra stones. So I think your move is ok, but a would be even more ok ^^]

Thank you for looking at this game.
--Fred Kochman

I didnt' see any glaring mistakes, but yose is always hard to know what is biggest

In general this game was not bad, just try to focus on your direction of play more (like attacking that C9 group, or not making too many weak group, and running out instead of livomg locally and painfully

And of course, don't forget to do tsumego every day :D

Hope the review will give you some helpful ideas
