AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hey, this is hlx from Go Teaching Ladder.

I'm going to point out moves you could better, answer your questions, and hopefully leave you satisfied with this review!

I hope you enjoy.


hlx];W[nc]C[hlx: Alright, so it's a 6 stone handicap game.

While your opponent is significantly stronger, you have been given a huge advantage to offset that, so the plan is to utilize what you have been given to full effect.]
;B[pf];W[pc];B[qc];W[qb]C[hlx: Safer to just connect at R16 here. (See branch)]

(;B[rb]C[hlx: This move was a mistake, against someone stronger they will punish with something like the following.]

(;W[oc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qa];W[oe];B[pe];W[of];B[og];W[ng];B[oh]
;W[nh]C[hlx Don't be afraid to push out more and gain more territory, instead of playing at p11 you could play at o11 still for more gain.]

(;B[oi];W[jd];B[jp]C[hlx: Taking the hoshi points (big points, also known as star points, the bolded circles) are important in the early game. 

The general rule of thumb is:

1. Respond to any immediate threats

2. Take big points

the term "big" means that you will gain the most by taking them, k4 was a good move.]
;W[jj];B[hc]TR[dd]C[moshes: I think this move was a mistake - I should have gone back to the contact fight and played o14 (or p16?)


hlx: This move was not a mistake, quite the contrary. It was quite good. This extension from the corner secures more territory for you while putting pressure on the k16 stone.]
;W[ic];B[id]LB[hd:A]C[moshes: This move was also a mistake.  I should have gone to H16 instead, this was over-aggressive.




hlx: You are correct, A was the correct response to this move.]
;W[ib];B[hd];W[hb]
(;B[gc]C[moshes: a mistake, I should have gone to J15 and then continued attacking k16.


J15 and attacking K16 are not what's essential here.

G17 was a mistake, it should have been played at G18. Follow the branch.]
;W[gb];B[je];W[ke];B[jf]C[moshes: I miscounted liberties... this one should have been played on J15


hlx: this move was fine, I will now explain a concept to you that plagued me up until I had teaching.

You do not have to fight everything. The concept of the game is not to kill the opponents stones.

The concept of the game is to stake claim to the most territory possible, capturing only gains two points per stone.

Where as , a strategic move could gain you like ten points per move! Do not try to kill everything, as it will make oyu weak and let your opponent push you around.]
;W[kc];B[kf]LB[fb:B][fc:A]C[hlx: This move is laright, youre pushing in on white, however you are in danger of being cut up at A, so play at B right now would seem necessary.]
;W[fc]C[hlx: As expected, white cuts in];B[fd]C[moshes: if I had played J15 earlier I could have ignored this attack and played elsewhere... like D or E17

hlx: Even if J15 had been played, a move like this cannot be ignored. He is crawling into your territory and costing you points along the way. This threat must be stopped.]
;W[ec]LB[ed:A]C[hlx: The proper response to this move is at A. You do not wan him to squeeze down and split those groups apart.]
;B[dc];W[db];B[cb];W[ed];B[eb]LB[ed:A]C[hlx: This move is not the immediate threat, this will gain you two points. White's stone at A is pushing into your territory, and if left is doing a move that is called:

Squeezing the toothpaste. He is pushing through two of your stones and flooding through, splitting them apart. You want to avoid this at all cost.]
;W[fb];B[da];W[fe]
(;B[gd]C[moshes: bad shape... I knew it but felt I had no choice.  Maybe I should have sacrificed the stone and played E15?


hlx: E15 would not have been proper in this situation, you are cut and will be in danger of losing the group if you do not connect at A, and then jump out of the area to try to live. Follow continuation from last move.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[ge];B[hf];W[he];B[ie];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg]
;W[mf];B[dh];W[eh];B[ei];W[fh];B[ch]LB[ii:D][mj:C][ik:A][kk:B]
C[moshes: should maybe have played C11 instead, or even E13

hlx: This move was proper later on in the game, in my opinion. This move maintains solid connection, avoids problems. 

You would play this game closer to endgame, when territory is decided already, you have much bigger moves on the board, which are marked.


D, would be jumping the large dead group out and attempting to make life, I'm honestly not sure if it can be done at this point but id played right you could connect out. Follow:]
;W[hh]LB[hj:A][mk:C][jl:B]C[hlx: At this point you are following him around the board, letting him pick and choose what territory he wants to make and what groups to kill.

You need to be proactive and be in the mindset of what's best for you, not just constant fighting the immediate stones. 

at this point it would appear the top group is sealed in with little hope at life, so lets not continue beating that dead body, let's focus on more important points.

You could take any of the following right now:

A, B, C

Any of these moves will be very profitable for you and put you ahead in points.

While you are given six handicap stones, you must not take htem for granted.

Play every game like its the final of a major tournament.];B[od]
;W[nd];B[le]C[hlx: Beating a dead horse, see previous comment.]
;W[kd];B[lf];W[ld];B[me];W[md]C[hlx: Here, a mistake by white will allow you to cut him. You have a chance to bring this group back to life, it may be small, but follow:]

(;B[gf]C[moshes: a mistake, I should have gone for N13 first. This one is really frustrating to me.

hlx: see previous branch. This move gains you nothing, as putting those stones in atari will simply cause him to solidly connect.]
;W[lg];B[ff];W[ee]C[moshes [23k?\]: sorry if I'm a bit slow, I'm still new...

yeah I think I was realizing I had just missed an opportunity...
so at this point, was there any way for me to save all those stones in the middle without taking major risks on the sides, or was it too late?


hlx: At this current point, it would seem you are sealed in, however if you go back to the previous branch I show you a way to take it back.

And no worries, you are doing fine for your kyu level, you are doing the right thing by getting your games reviewed, it's the best way to learn.]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[gj];W[hj];B[gk];W[hk]LB[hl:A]C[hlx: play at A if you are going to follow him, push him outwards, you make more territory.]
;B[gl];W[ni];B[nj];W[mj];B[nk];W[mk];B[nl]LB[ml:A]C[hlx: again, A]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[hl];B[gm];W[hp]C[hlx: White is trying to break up your stones! You must respond, you cannot play elsewhere at the moment. Follow continuation]

(;B[nf]C[moshes: stupid.  I was daydreaming I guess.

hlx: Seems like it :P this is what's called "Self-Atari" you should never do it, only in more advanced cases (see life and death problems) refer to previous branch.]
;W[ne];B[gp]LB[gq:A]C[hlx: Touching a single stone only makes it stronger. Play at A instead.]
;W[hq];B[go];W[ho];B[gq];W[gn];B[fn];W[hn];B[em];W[mp];B[oq]
LB[nq:A]C[moshes: I'm not sure about this one... should I have gone farther out?

hlx: A would have been a better response, this seems too slow.]
;W[mm];B[nq]C[hlx: Again, too slow, moving one step at a time doesn't gain you as much as you should.]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[nn];B[on];W[oo];B[om];W[np];B[po];W[op];B[qn]
;W[qq]C[moshes: was there any way I could have prevented this?]
;B[pq]C[hlx: good job on protecting the cut!];W[qp]C[hlx: Here, white is going to try to make a base in the corner to secure two eyes, your job is to prevent this, I would play at R2 here. Continuation.]

(;B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[qs];B[rp];W[rq];B[sr];W[rr];B[sq]C[moshes: a mistake, I should have protected at s5 I think]
;W[ro]C[moshes [23k?\]: oops :)];B[rn];W[sp];B[sn];W[ss];B[os]
;W[ps];B[so];W[rp];B[cq]C[hlx: Protecting the corner from another invasion, good move.]
;W[lr];B[gr];W[hr];B[hs];W[is];B[gs];W[jr];B[eo]C[hlx: This move is unnecessary, each time you play into your own territory without a white stone being played in there first will cost you a point.]
;W[ms];B[nr]C[moshes: I think this was a mistake.  I should have gone to o1, then used H7 as a ko threat.  I didn't see it at the time.]
;W[ls];B[rd]LB[fa:B][oa:A][hm:C]C[moshes: I think this was unnecessary.

hlx: You are correct, this move costs you a point and does not gain you anything. A more proper move would be at A, B, or C as these moves reduce your opponent.]
;W[oa];B[pa];W[fa];B[ea];W[hm];B[fk]C[hlx: again, not necessary, loses you a point. If you believe you have played all the possibly moves, pass.]

;B[ss];W[so];B[rs]C[hlx: At this point, whites group is dead, as he only has one eye, you can capture it if necessary only (i.e. white trys to escape) Otherwise at the end you just mark it dead.]
))
(;B[gq];W[hn];B[hm];W[im];B[il]C[hlx: Seems like a stupid move, but here you use a cutting trick to allow yourself a free move of movement in the direction you want to go. You can push white where you want him to be and make his living tough.]

(;B[ie];W[gf];B[ih]C[hlx: Something to this effect. A group needs two eyes to live, and right now this group has none, you need to make some breathing room to create some if required to.]

(;B[gb]C[hlx: The following sequence would have been what I believe to be the more correct response, as it doesn't allow white to slip in and leech out territory.]
