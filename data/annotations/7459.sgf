C[[I'll put my comments in brackets to set them apart from yours.  Learning how to deal with overplays is extremely difficult.. it's something I still work on and certainly something that is a big issue at the top levels of play.  I'll try to give some insight into how I think about overplays.  One big thing to remember is not to counter your opponent's overplay with an overplay of your own.\]

Peatman (as black):

Thank you for reviewing my game. I added much of my own comments, with variations. See what you think of it. (and add some more about things I did not see.)

This is a typical game showing my weakness: Opening is OK but, my response to overplay is sometimes very bad. The opponent is getting away too easy with his overplay.

Although white is not getting away with every overplay, he wins by 16.5 points.

The game was played on IGS on the 30th of september 2009.];B[pd]

;W[co]C[Peatman:

I am already in front of his shimari. I think there are bigger moves than -lets say- G3, even more ruining his 'box': I also make a shimari!

[I certainly agree.  I may have preferred a pincer as W in this situation.\]]
;B[ec];W[cf]C[Peatman:

White plays a bit too close, I think.

[Definitely.. it sets up W for a weak group.\]];B[ch];W[df]
C[Peatman:

I should punish him for this fearful move, and make him even more chicken. But how? E12?

[This move is very strange.  You should punish it by ignoring it.  It's almost as if your opponent passed.  He made himself heavier without actually extending much at all.\]]
;B[ck]C[Peatman: I didn't. Peatman is also chicken.

[This is fine.  It's much easier to attack when you have a base.  That or E12 would be okay in my mind.  If W had the top right corner or support on the top I would favor C9.\]]
;W[qg]
(;B[qi]C[[This pincer is too close.  It winds up creating problems for you.  One reason to approach the corner from a distance, as W does here, is that it avoids an effective pincer.  By playing that pincer as you have you give W ample room to attack your pincer stone, especially since W is low and solid on the bottom.  The typical responses to R13 are R15 and N16 or N17.  See variations.\]]
;W[qk];B[oi];W[og]C[[This looks worse for you than for W.\]]
;B[nd];W[rd]
(;B[qe]C[[This is the wrong way to think.  You can't cut W here, so don't strengthen him.  R17 is what you want to play if you are going to defend that corner.  See variations.\]]
;W[re];B[qf];W[rg];B[ok]C[[Notice how the presence of the S13 stone makes your life difficult.  This is why you don't want to strengthen your opponent for no reason.  The play at R14 gains you nothing locally because you have no chance to cut, and it hurts you globally.\]]
;W[ri]C[[I favor tenuki here, as I explain.  However to play localy see variations.\]]

(;B[qh];W[rh]
(;B[pg]LB[pg:A][qj:B]C[Peatman:

This was too early, I think. This only strengthens white. See variations.

[You have to give W the right side here.. there are more fruitful things for you to fight for.  You should be thinking about W's C14 group.  The fate of that group is the overwhelming focus of this board.  How can you profit maximally from it?  I would take sente over there as soon as possible.  That is one of the problems with the close pincer at R11.. now you have to defend when there is a perfectly good place for you to attack.\]]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[pf];B[jc]SQ[hd]C[[This is not so good.. it has the same idea as H16, but it doesn't put as much pressure on the C14 group.  See move 43 for why I don't like this move.\]]
;W[on];B[gq]C[Peatman:

Until now, apart from some mistakes in the opening, I'm quite  pleased with the opening. I'm allright now I think, but I mess up later....

[This is unnecessary.  You need to be focusing on C14!  You are ahead in my estimation because of W's super weak group on the top left.  That is the most urgent thing by far on the board.  Also urgent is your P11 group.  Big moves beyond those two include R17 and G5.\]]
;W[qd]C[Peatman:

Instead, in hindsight, I think attacking the P11 group might be a better idea for white.

[W has to figure out what to do with C14.. attacking P11 is one good option, so I would agree with you.\]]
;B[pe];W[mg];B[fe]C[[Good, starting to focus here.  However, a single stone at H16 would be more efficient in my mind than K17 and F15 together.  Notice how the presence of F15 all but makes K17 useless.  H16 and E12 work much better together as a pair of stones.  This is part of the "early game" thinking that can plague new players.  The mantra is "corner, sides, middle," but remember that you will want to build off the side in an optimal way.\]]
;W[dd];B[dc];W[ed];B[fd];W[ef];B[qj]C[[F14!!!  There's no reason to allow him to escape.  R10 is very inefficient and not sufficient threat to force S10 (even though W makes a move there).  If you want to focus on this group, run out with N10 or even farther to M10.  However, attacking C14 in an intelligent way will help this group a lot, so there's no reason to play here directly yet.\]]
;W[rk];B[pk]C[Peatman:

My group needed some attention.  At least I have one eye already. Maybe I was too afraid.

[An eye won't help you as much as attacking C14 in terms of strengthening this group.\]]
;W[qm]C[Peatman:

... but he's not too sure either. I think it's a small move.

[Yes, this is a pass by W.\]]
(;B[jf]C[[F14!!!  That severely restricts W's options and forces him to run toward your weakish C12 group, which will cause you to strengthen it.  See variation.\]]
;W[bi]C[Peatman:

Now this is my weakness: This is according to me an clear overplay. How to respond to this? Find some variations I tried myself.

[This is a big overplay, now W has two weak groups right next to each other.  The trick is how to play back against it.  You never want to think "punish" or "kill" in response to an overplay.  You want to think "profit."  If you get too aggressive, you will make overplays yourself and W's original move will look like a stroke of genius.  Your variation at B13 is the right idea, but played incorrectly.  If someone makes a shoulder hit move on you (shoulder hit = diagonal approach, what B11 is to C12) the correct response is almost always to contact.  That is a rule of thumb to remember.  That means C11 and B12 are your "rule of thumb" options, and you should read them first before considering others.  C11 here has the drawback that it allows W to connect.  That is usually bad.  Thus, I favor B12, which is the move you actually made.\]]

(;B[bh]LB[bg:B][bh:A][ci:C];W[bk]C[[This is a little bit desparate.  You can use it to build up massive strength against C14.  Allow W to connect on the bottom.. it won't hurt you.  Your greater profit is in attacking C14.  Your stone at G3 ensures that W can't get a huge moyo on the bottom left.  See my variations.  I try out a few options for W.\]]

(;B[ci]LB[ci:A][cl:B];W[cl]C[Peatman:

Peatman:

Wit wins by 16.5 points

[He actually gave you an extra point at D11 ^_^  In any case, I think there are a few places you can look for improvement.  First, in the early game, keep your eye focused at all times on what groups are weak and what groups are strong.  Don't make weak ones yourself if you can avoid it (sometimes you have to).  If your opponent makes a weak one, start thinking about how to exploit it.  That may not be an immediate attack (though in this case it probably should have been).  When you are responding to overplays, don't focus only on the overplay stone itself.  Most of the benefit you can get out of an overplay isn't by killing that group.  It's by allowing the group to run for life and making tons of profit in the meantime.  Finally, don't make moves in an area just because your opponent did or just to "finish" a shape.  Every move should have a purpose.  And its purpose should be greater than any other move you can find.  If it isn't saving you from death or killing your opponent, it should be getting you territory.  If it isn't doing either of those there's really no point to playing it.\]

I think the move that caused you the most problems in the whole game was the pincer at R11.  That itself was an overplay that your opponent managed to use to take the whole corner and side.  So that is an easy mistake to fix ^_^  Please let me know if you have any questions about my comments.  Good luck improving your game!\]]
