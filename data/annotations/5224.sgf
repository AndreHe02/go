C[DC: Hello, my name is Dylan Carter. This is a game I played at the Epsom Go tournament in the UK 08/07/2006.

I  lost this game but I seemed to be ahead for a lot of the game wityh good attacking potential, and a big mistake by white.

Please advise on how to capitolise fully.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq]
;W[dp];B[oc];W[qj];B[qh];W[po];B[np]C[DC: I play this as I wish to leave the invasion potential if white tenukis after the sequence.

klin: OK];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[jq]C[DC: I conidered this to be slighly overplayed, dismissing the attack on the open right group I went on with a leaning attack.

klin: D10 better at this moment];B[on]C[klin: B P6 helps W and eliminates  R8 invasion]
;W[pm];B[hp]C[klin: B H4 could play at H3 or F3];W[jo];B[om]
;W[pl];B[hn];W[hr]C[klin: W has H2 which makes H4 attack not effective.]
;B[gq];W[jm];B[hl];W[cm];B[jk];W[kl];B[nk];W[kk];B[jj];W[mn]
;B[kp];W[io]C[DC: I thought this was a good defence/attacking move by my opponent.

klin: W J5 may not be as good as it looks.  Now B L3 sente.]
;B[ol];W[gr];B[fc]C[DC: The potential on the top is greatest now. The idea being L10 eventually.

klin: Bad move! B F17 left the main battlefiled.  B has to play at E3.]
;W[hc]C[DC: I considered the H16 tsuke. Upon discussion with my opposition after the game he replied he would play J17. I consider this a mistake and had I known this I would have probed.]

(;B[cc]C[DC: Jumping in keeps things simple.

klin: B is trong on the top.  Therefore, B shuld play at F15 and try to attack H17.]
;W[cd]C[klin: W C16 wrong direction.  D17 better.];B[dc];W[ed]
;B[fb];W[di]C[DC: I feel I black must now take the G15 point and cut through.

klin: w d11 bad.];B[ge];W[kc];B[id]C[klin: B's next several moves basically help W settle down.  B should play at N17 or M18 to attack W H17 and L17.]
;W[ic];B[kd];W[jd];B[je];W[jc];B[ke];W[mc];B[df]C[DC: The shape attack.]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[dg];B[dh];W[eg];B[ci];W[eh];B[ch];W[cj]C[DC: Opponent misread the atari on B4 to gain liberties.]
;B[bf]C[DC: Should white play E14 to avoid bad shape?];W[ce]
C[klin: W C15 bad.  W could play at D10 now.  If BC15, W E14.]
;B[dj];W[ei];B[ck];W[bj];B[bk];W[be];B[ag];W[eq];B[kj]C[DC: Gaining a grip on the centre with intention of severly attacking the left white group.

klin: Left W group can easily make two eyes, because B17, A18 all sente.  Nevertheless, L10 is a thick move.]
;W[ej]C[DC: White sees this.];B[dk];W[oj];B[nj];W[hq]C[klin: W H3 helps B.]
;B[gp]C[klin: B G4 too small.  Should ignor.];W[me];B[bc]C[klin: B B17 big.  W should have played it first.]
;W[ff];B[fk];W[hf];B[ie];W[hi];B[fe];W[ee];B[gh]C[DC: I think this may be a mistake, but how should I attack?

klin: Can't];W[hh];B[jg];W[gj];B[co];W[cp];B[bn];W[do];B[bp]
;W[bq];B[bm];W[cn];B[bo];W[ho];B[go]C[DC: I knew this was coming and before the invasion I considered defending F6. The only problem is that white will complete the corner. Which is larger. Since I can sacrifice in good shape I chose the corner invasion.]
;W[gn];B[fn];W[gm];B[hm]C[klin: B H7 a mistake.  Should F7.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[en];B[dm];W[fo];B[fl]C[klin: B F8 meaningless.]
;W[ob]C[klin: W P18 huge now.  If B plays at O18 first, the whole group is threaten.]
;B[pb];W[nb];B[nd];W[md];B[oi];W[ri];B[rr]C[klin: B S2 should S12. (No comment beyond this point.)]
;W[rq];B[rh];W[nf]C[DC: Defending around Q14 seems small and is gote.]
;B[aq];W[br];B[kr];W[jr];B[kq];W[gb];B[ln];W[km]C[DC: Strange move!]
;B[lm];W[rg];B[qi];W[rj];B[sh];W[qf]C[DC: I think Q15 works better with sacrifice of the S13 stone.]
;B[of];W[oe];B[pe]C[DC: Blank is ok.];W[ne];B[pc]C[DC: And fixes a problem.]
;W[lg];B[ig];W[hg];B[og];W[ko];B[lo];W[li];B[lj];W[pj];B[gc]
;W[ha];B[mi];W[lh];B[dn]C[DC: Quite big. Anything else?];W[pa]
;B[qa];W[oa];B[rb];W[fa];B[da]C[DC: No more moves recoreded. time restraint.

DC: GNU go estimates black wins by 6 at this point and this is certainly how I estimated.

I think the 'time trouble' at the end caused me some loss maybe.]
