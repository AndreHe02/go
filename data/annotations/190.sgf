;B[pk];W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[ql]C[jm: r8 is a bad move. It provokes B r9 that makes  the r8 stone weak, and makes
B strong in the upper part. r7 is the book move. It makes miai of s9 and
p7. After a comment of Lounella, I don't play these "under the shoulder" hit
moves anymore.];B[qk];W[pl];B[ok]L[ol][om][nm]C[jm: the p9 black move is weak. B should  double hane with B a, W b, B c.
The double hane on the head of two stones is frequently a good move.
B has not to be afraid for the p9-r9 stones because of the weakness
the W group.];W[op]C[jm: p4 is bad. W deprives himself of  the p3 move later, when he has a stone
around m3. p4 don't help W very much. o5 directly is better, and n7
probably still better.];B[oq];W[no];B[mp];W[pg]C[jm: By tewari, it's clear  that p4 is bad. If W directly at o4, B n4,
W don't want to play p4. Q 13 is somewhat audacious ; the lower
W group is still very weak. If B can make the q9 stones strong
by attacking one of the groups, the other is going to suffer.];B[nd];W[qe]
C[jm: Another "under the shoulder hit". B is happy to close the corner with  r16.]
;B[qd];W[qi]C[jm: now the two weak groups are nearly equivalent. S9  threatens both of them,
It's probably better to enclose one of them.];B[oh]L[ng][oi][ol]
C[jl: I considered B 'a'  but was afraid of having my 3 stones under attack after W 'b'.
jm: No need to be afraid for the 3 stones. If W attacks them from one side,  the other
side is going to suffer: it W b, B c for example, is sente and no one W group  is
completely out.];W[og];B[ph]C[jl: B q12 is not good (settles W for no  benefit to B).
jm: Yes, o12 is better.];W[qh];B[qg]L[ng]C[jl: the cut was played as a sacrifice  just to play 'a' later, but I changed my
mind later so the cut turned out to be useless.];W[rg];B[nh]L[ng]C[jl: I  decided that B 'a' was too dangerous.
jm: B a is stupid because of the stupid r12 move. If there is no stone at r12,
B a, W cut, B p11 and B is quite happy.];W[ng];B[mh]C[jm: After the  r13 sacrifice, the W upper group is nearly alive. The o12-q12 stones
are nearly useless. W should reinforce the lower group instead of o13, B  should
not add n12 but attack the lower group. In a way, B is still paying the bad  shape
of p12-q12.];W[mg];B[lg];W[lf];B[kg];W[ld]C[jm A cut at n14 seems possible  (see var. 1). An attack on the lower group more
important.]
(;B[kf]L[lh]C[jl: the w cut at 'a' was a worry for a long time, but I  decided that connecting
was too mild.];W[ke];B[on]L[pp][oo][qo]C[jl: the peep may not  be good because it removes the possibility of B a, W b, B c.
jm: I agree. Moreover, it deprives B of the n5 move.];W[oo];B[ol];W[nn]
;B[ln]L[pm][ll]C[jl: I was afraid that W would not answer B 'a' and I wanted B 'b' later.
jm: q6 seems better than a. The B move is useless for B. It's too soon
to make territory in the center, especially with the weak W group exiting.
b doesn't not makes much territory (5 pts ?) What B should be seeking is
to make W push him on the 4th line on the lower border, by depriving him
of his life base.];W[om];B[fq]C[jm: Now B has no fear for the  q9 stones. He can stabilize them with q7 is necessary.
It's somewhat painful to see the two weak W groups relatively secure, but B  has
a great central influence.];W[dn];B[dr]C[jm: d2 is somewhat dubious. f5  directly let the corner open. An approach move in the upper
left is probably the most important move, actually.];W[hp]C[jloup 9k*: is  entering byo-yomi
jm: h4 is a strange move, the normal move is h3, but in this context it  doesn't turn
out well for W. B should f5, separating the stones calmly.];B[hn]C[jl: I also  considered B 'a' but I was afraid of losing both the bottom side and the
center, so I chose to give up the side only.
jm: I would call that a bad choice. The center is still very open (what if W  n7, not considering the left frontier(?). A wall is not to be used to make  territory
but for battle. If W goes into the B sphere of influence, B has just to answer
calmly to win the game.];W[fp]C[jm: Now W is nearly connected. The lower territory is quite disminished, the central moyo is still open, and not the least, the d2-f4 stones are weak. B has to reinforce them.]
;B[cq];W[gq]C[g3 is nearly superfluous. The upper left corner is more  important. I would play W c15.]
;B[bn]L[bo]C[jl: would B 'a' be better?
jm: b5 is the move one sees. I am not sure b6 or b5 is necessary.
    I would play in the upper left.];W[bo];B[co];W[cn];B[bp];W[bm];B[ao]
;W[cl]C[jm: Ouch! Now the d5 stone is strong, and perspectives of B  territory in the center are weak (it would suppose to let W have the whole upper left).]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df]C[jm: d14 is doubtful. I would prefer f14. B don't want to  play around c10, near the W thickness.]
;W[fd];B[ed]C[jm: e16 is a stupid move. B helps W to make the  upper border W territory.
As long as the n14 cut remains, is may be possible to invade this border, and
have a weak W group as a target. After e16-e17, the g17 move is lost.];W
[ec];B[fe];W[gd];B[dj]C[jm: d10 is useless. It doesn't close the central  territory, it doesn't stabilize really the d14 stones.]
;W[bj]C[jm: b10 is not good. A simple connection at e6 would be  better. B should cut at d5.]
;B[hf];W[fj];B[hj];W[hl];B[gk];W[gm];B[fk];W[jl];B[im];W[il];B[jj];W[kq]
;B[id];W[ge];B[gf];W[ie];B[he];W[hd];B[je];W[jd];B[if]C[jm: B and W shared the dame in the center in a somewhat fuzzy way.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[ie];B[pe];W[qf];B[id];W[ej];B[kd]L[ek][mf]C[jl: B 'a' was unlikely to  capture the W stones anyway, so I was glad to get an
opportunity to cut at 'b'.];W[ek];B[mf];W[ff];B[fg];W[ee];B[ef];W[dd];B
[eh];W[di];B[lq]C[jl: B m3 strengthens m6. This was later useful  when attacking the right w group.]
;W[kr];B[rj];W[rd];B[rc];W[se];B[sc];W[ri];B[rl];W[qm];B[rm];W[qn];B[pn]
;W[rn]C[jm: s5 is simpler to make life.];B[ro];W[nl];B[mm];W[ml];B[nm]C
[jl: B o7 was a big mistake, made under time  pressure. It should have been m8.]
;W[mn];B[lm];W[lo];B[mo];W[lp];B[ll];W[nq];B[mq]C[jl: B n3 is useless but I had only a few seconds left.]
;W[nr];B[or];W[mr];B[ps];W[rq]C[jl: B loses on time here. I think that B was still  slightly ahead on board despite
the big blunders made in the end.
jm: I would call it a close game.])
(;B[mf];W[me];B[nf];W[ne];B[of];W[pf];B[oe]C[jm: Both W groups are still  weak. W will make the B groups strong by making them alive.]
