C[Hi,thanks for your time.
My main questions are about the fight in the upper left and the fight in the bottom.
thanks for your time];B[pp];W[dd];B[pf]C[unusual opening];W[dq]
;B[do]LB[dm:A][cn:B][cq:C][ck:D]C[Donal: In my opinion, black 5 is just inviting trouble. White can pinch at A, which works really well with his stone at 2. (See diagram.)

Better would be to play at Black B, which makes C and D miai.

Looking over this entire game, I think my main thought is "Play simpler moves!"]

(;W[cm]LB[dm:A][en:B][dl:C][gq:D]C[White 6 is not bad, but A is a better. If you play White 6, Black can play B, threatening  C and D.]
;B[cq]C[Black 7 is in the wrong direction. Making a base in the corner is not a high priority, as Black is more concerned with making use of his star point at the right.]
;W[cr];B[cp];W[gq]C[White 10 is good, as it erases Black's potential territory on the right.]
;B[br]LB[er:A][en:B][dl:C][iq:D]C[In many cases, black 11 is considered to be the vital point for making eye space, but here there is no immediate need to play it. Black is losing the opportunity to play at A instead. Better to play at B, threatening C and D.]
;W[dr];B[ck]LB[em:A][fo:B][di:C]C[Black 13 is way too aggressive. It looks like he is powerfully attacking White 6, but after White jumps to A it is Black that is under attack.

Black will now probably have to jump to B. So before playing 13, Black should have realized that the exchange of A for B was inevitable. He would probably not have played at 13 if these moves were already there. Perhaps he would have played at C. So C would have been one reasonable alternative to 13.]
;W[em];B[fo];W[jq]LB[iq:A][gn:B][cn:C][ch:D]C[seems like the right direction

Donal: White 16 further erases Black's framework on the right, and prevents a Black pincer at A, so it's a good move. Black's corner group doesn't have eyes yet. Now that White has defended, Black needs to defend somewhere also, such as B, C, or D.]
;B[cf]LB[fc:A][dh:B]C[Black probably wants to exchange 17 for white A, and then return to B. But there are problems with this. First, White may invade on the left, so Black is inviting needless trouble. Second, even if White answers at A, this exchange has further erased Black's framework on the right for no reason.]
;W[ch]LB[fc:A]C[White doesn't really need to invade at 18, but it is a powerful way to play. I would probably play at A and try to win a slow-paced game. The invasion could easily turn against White if he makes the slightest mistake.]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[di];W[dh];B[eh];W[ei];B[cd];W[de];B[df];W[dj]
LB[ci:A]C[Since Black 25 was gote, White was able to play 28 and get a nice result. But White should realize that he was lucky to do this well because Black normally would have played a move like A instead of 25. (See diagram.)]

;B[cc]LB[be:A]C[Black 39 is in interesting move, but he could easily get into trouble because his stones on the left are not alive yet. Better to just make eyes by playing A.]
;W[bf];B[eb];W[bg];B[cg];W[gf]C[White 44 might be good, but it's impossible for either player to read this out. Go is not a dice game! Play moves that you know will succeed.]

(;B[hg]LB[fg:A]C[White 46 works if Black plays at A instead of 47. (See diagram.)]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[hf]
(;B[ge]LB[fe:A][ig:B]C[When Black plays 51, White can't cut at A. Black will play B, threatening two different ladders.]

(;W[ig]C[White 52 defends against the ladders, but leaves his other group vulnerable. He needs to play a move that defends both groups at once. (See diagram.)]
;B[fe];W[hh]LB[jf:A][if:B][ie:C]C[Instead of capturing, White could consider moves like A, B, or C, but the result would be similar.]

;B[ad];W[be];B[ic];W[gd];B[he];W[ib]LB[jc:A]C[Black could now just extend at A. But it's difficult to read it out because Black isn't alive in the corner.]
;B[hb]LB[gb:A]C[i guess ko is the best result here?

Donal: Ko at A was possible. But it would have been better to ignore the atari of black 65 and escape to the right]

;B[bn];W[bs];B[ar];W[cn];B[co]C[White can still get ko. (See diagram.)]

(;W[ap];B[bp];W[an];B[am];W[qn];B[nq]C[Black 99 need to be at A, to keep White from getting territory in the center.]
;W[pd];B[jd];W[rp];B[qq];W[rq];B[kq]C[Black is winning, and should just be trying to play simple moves that reduce White's territory in the center. No need to be complicated.]
;W[lq]C[Nice move!];B[kr];W[lr]
(;B[kp];W[lp];B[pn];W[ko];B[jp]LB[lo:A]C[seems bad for w

White is behind in ths game, so trying something tricky is reasonable. The exchange of 12 for 13 leaves a cutting point at A and also weakens the white group to the left, so playing at A would have been better.

Looking at the game overall, White lost his stones on the upper left without compensation, so all Black needed to do was prevent White from getting a lot of territory in the center. He got into trouble somehow though.

[co:C]C[After white 1, Black can force with 2, 4, and 6 before pinching at 8. But White leisurely plays at 9, forcing Black to capture at 10. White has profitted with 3,5 and 9, and is quite happy with this exchange. White has sente and can take the big point at 11.

Normally, one would rather avoid playing moves like 2 and 4, because they are just giving profit to White.

Note that Black does not immediately play at A. He keeps the option of forcing at B instead, so White will not be able to attach at C to reduce Black's territory.]
