;B[pd]C[JH : Many variations were given by Palustris ; I just commented them not always correcting them even if some moves were not the only possibility.]
;W[dq];B[cd];W[qp];B[ic];W[qf]LB[nd:a]C[JH : Usually played at "b" as the stone on the upper side is far from the corner but I think it is playable.]
;B[of];W[qc];B[qd]LB[pc:a]C[JH : Should be played on the other side to prepare the  black moyo at "a"]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[nc];B[od];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[qb]
;W[kd];B[co]LB[ie:a][dj:b]C[palustris : I don't see any non-submissive move to defend J17.  Because, white is not very strong, I don't think he may attack now.
JH : Ok. The tobi at "b" in the center is not bad but my preference is "c"]
;W[dk];B[gp]LB[fo:a][di:b]C[palustris : with white very far pincer, the left side has no more value, so I play lightly at the bottom. If I make something more severe, i will build strength to attack white D9 and with my weak upper side, it seems wrong direction.
JH : I think a jump at "b" to prepare a pincer at "c" is better.The left side is still valuable but 23 is playable.]
;W[eo]C[palustris : Ishida says D5 to be joseki here.
JH : Yes, the white shape is not so good.];B[cq]C[JH : Good move]
;W[cr];B[dp]C[JH : Good move]
(;W[eq]LB[ep:a]C[palustris : rather submissive, why not C3 ?  Feel free to comment my variants.
JH : With 28, White should Block at "b".Playing C3 is not good as Black connect his stones by playing himself at "b"]
;B[bq];W[fp]LB[ep:a]C[JH : Just connecting at "b" seems usual.]
;B[ho]LB[go:a]C[palustris : I don't know how to play here. I want to profit from white shape but I don't want to play too heavy ...
JH : Just extend to "b" seems OK];W[dn];B[br];W[ds]LB[kp:a]
C[palustris : this move seems submissive to me.
JH : White 34 It is too early even if almost sente. I think I will play at "b"]
;B[bm];W[cl]C[palustris : this move too. White should have attack my heavy formation G4-H5. Now, it's too late.]
;B[do];W[gq];B[hq];W[fn];B[gr];W[fq]C[JH : I don't like too much to be forced like this. May be the simple connexion  at 40 without 38 was better for White than the sequence played in the game.]
;B[oq]
(;W[mq]LB[pn:a]C[palustris : why not the simpler Q5 move. Black cannot get optimal formation
JH : 44 is jealous. White should extend on the right side like "b"]
;B[oo];W[pn];B[lp]C[JH : Good for Black.];W[pq];B[or];W[on]
;B[no];W[qj]C[palustris : Black territory is safe so it is inferior to the variation above.]
;B[ie]C[palustris : I still don't know how to play here.
JH : 53 is good because it have some influence on the white group on the left.]
;W[ed];B[df];W[hd];B[id];W[cc];B[bc];W[ef]
(;B[dg]C[palustris : it is submissive but I cannot read out the so many variations. Of course C18 is better. I'm just afraid to play. I have given some variations.
JH : No. 61 is all right. White is still under attack];W[dc]
;B[bb];W[gf];B[hg];W[gc]LB[fh:a]C[JH : The first idea is to jump at "b" but this 66 seems all right.]
;B[lc]C[JH : Good (and vital) point.];W[lb]C[JH  : This move is too bad. 68 should be played at 69. May be one loosing move.]
;B[kc]C[JH : Black takes the lead with this 69.];W[md]LB[mc:a]
C[70 at "b" to live immediately seems better];B[ld];W[le];B[me]
;W[kb];B[jc];W[mc]C[JH : It is terrible to be obliged to live like this.]
;B[cj]C[JH : Bad move];W[bl];B[cm];W[dm];B[bs]C[palustris : Bad move : it's not necessary. But it's easy to say that now I have time to read.
JH : Yes not necessary. Black is alive.];W[ph]C[JH : Good move]
;B[gn]C[I];W[gm];B[hm]C[palustris : I'm a little afraid about the ko ...
JH : As we can see in the variations, Black can deal with the ko but White should have played it as he could take sente.]

(;W[hl]C[palustris : maibe it's better for white to save the ko for later.]
;B[gl];W[fm];B[im];W[gk]LB[hk:a]C[JH : better to play "b"];B[il]
;W[hk];B[mf]C[palustris : slow but safe !
JH : OK];W[mm]C[JH : Good move];B[eg];W[ff];B[ol]LB[nk:a][ni:b]
C[JH : Very dangerous. White can counter-attack at "b". Black should simply play around "c"]
;W[ql]C[JH : Too submissive];B[oj]LB[ni:a]C[JH : Still not good. Should be played at "b"]
;W[nn];B[mo];W[nh]C[JH : White has a good opportunity to reverse the game.]
;B[ml];W[ll];B[mk]C[JH : Black is still in trouble because of his too deep invasion]
;W[kn];B[mi];W[kp];B[ko]C[JH : This move is not good. Anyway Black is in trouble.]
;W[ip]LB[kq:a]C[JH : May be the simple atari before playing this nozoki was correct. Anyway, Black will probably not connect and play at "d".]

(;B[iq]C[palustris : blunder move.
JH : Yes the "c" variation was better for Black];W[jo];B[lo]
LB[kq:a]C[JH : Should be played at "b"];W[hp];B[go]
(;W[jm]LB[jq:a]C[palustris : blunder, K3 wins easily
JH : Yes White should play at "b" and the game is difficult for Black]
;B[jl]LB[jq:a]C[JH : White has still time to play "b". So, Black should imediately play there ("b")]
;W[lm]LB[jq:a]C[JH :  Should still be played at "b"];B[kq]C[JH : Black is now safe on the lower side with this 19]
;W[lk];B[jp];W[io];B[jn]LB[hn:a]C[JH : This move is a small mistake because Black is losing one stone and one liberty. Play simply at "b"]

;B[jh]C[JH: Black is now safe but it was very dangerous. He played safely and white had no chance to capture some stones.]
;W[ci];B[di];W[bj];B[ch];W[bi];B[bh];W[dj]LB[pr:a]C[JH : This move is smaller than "b". If white plays "b", the game can be close.]

(;W[ah];B[ag];W[ai];B[bf];W[dd];B[de];W[cn]C[palustris : seems aji keshi, but I don't see how white could make more profit here.
JH : Playing the hane first is good style];B[bn];W[am];B[bo]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[pj];B[oi];W[pa]C[palustris : looks like double-sente

;B[mr]C[JH : An interesting  game.For white, the biggest mistake was how he lived with the upper right group.For Black, his erasure move on the right was too deep and dangerous but white missed todestroy the lower edge territory and finally lost the game because Black skillfully escapes with his two weak groups he obtained because of his too deep erasing move.]
