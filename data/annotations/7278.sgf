C[Hello, dear Mr. Reviewer. I'm a 3-dan on IGS. I've played a reverse-komi
game (-5.5 komi) with a 1d+ (I'm White.), and, although the opening
stage might hint a funny game's coming, it turned into a real
mess
of struggle. We both took the game seriously; in the end, I won
by only a small margin.

My main doubt about this game is: even though the opening seemed
to favor me, with my quasi-capturing of three center stones,
I had a hard time trying to catch up with my opponent's points.
I want to know what was the cause.

However, I want you to fix my small mistakes as well. Thanks
for your kindly reviewing for me.];B[pd];W[nc]C[Alex: Seo Bongsu, 9p likes this plan]
;B[dp];W[cn];B[pp];W[hi]C[I wasn't in the mood to play a 'normal' game.

Alex:  I cannot call it bad - the problem is how to use H11]
;B[jj]C[To my delight, my opponent agreed with me.

Alex: As B I will take empty corner];W[jh];B[hk];W[fj]C[I felt that a keima on this side produces better shape than on
the other. Was my thought correct?

Alex:  Yes, these moves are good];B[fl];W[dk]C[Alex:  W has good shape and nice connection with C6]
;B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[en]C[I decided to split my opponent apart. Was this correct?

Alex:  It's very nice locally, but the attack on the top can be more urgent]
;B[fp];W[gn];B[hp];W[in];B[ng]
(;W[lj]LB[mf:A]C[The attack seemed to put Black on the spot, but Black lightly
(or not?) discarded it. Could you provide some alternatives to
this?

Alex:  Your move looks good. Another option is kosumi at A -]

(;B[lf]C[Alex:  Not the best order -];W[lh];B[dd]C[Alex: Black's idea of sacrifising the center is correct]
;W[km]C[I completed the encircle without hesitation and felt as if I'd
had a giant ponnuki radiating tremendous influence on every direction,
but in the progress that followed, I felt that the 'influence'
was quite useless.

Alex:  W spent too many moves here. I feel that W is behind]

(;W[qq]LB[mf:B][qq:A]C[I was in time trouble here. Was this move the main cause of White's
points not being enough? Should I take hold of the upper side?

Alex:  San-san invasion looks correct];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro]
;B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm]LB[mg:A]C[I didn't think I had any chance of invading the right side, so
I played this move.

this good?

also
got sente.

it led to a ko that made me win.

C[My play in this corner is intuition-led. I don't know if it really
works.
