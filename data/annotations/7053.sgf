C[XCMeijin: Hi! I'm playing as white, and I thought this game was very interesting, with lots of possibilities both sides could've explored. Please review mainly for white, but there will be some small question for black's side too.

Thanks!

TM: Hello, I'm the reviewer. My comments start with 'TM'.];B[pc]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[ed];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[jq]
;W[dn];B[cd]TR[pe][op]C[TM: Notice that black has stones present in all four corners of the board, while white has nothing on the right side. I would play in one of the other corners before it's too late. This is urgent.]

(;W[ce]C[XCMeijin: Do you agree with this choice of joseki?

TM: Locally it seems fine; you could also consider D14, which works nicely with the influence-based stone at E16.]
;B[be]
(;W[cf]C[TM: The usual follow-up is to pull back to D15, which will give you the choice between taking a large corner or getting outside influence (if the ladder works).]
;B[dc];W[dd];B[cc];W[ec];B[bf];W[cg];B[jd];W[ef]C[XCMeijin: Felt this was important to take.

TM: On the one hand, you want to be patient and make good shape, but on the other hand, you are letting black get away with taking over the whole board. I would be more inclined to tenuki here and start a fight if black later takes E14.]
;B[pj]C[TM: At this point it is clear that it will be an uphill battle for white. Black's stones are laying claim to over half the board, neutralizing any influence that white's two groups may have.]
;W[pe];B[nd]
(;W[qi]C[TM: Oh no! You are inviting black to press against your stone here, not only making it more difficult for you to live at the top, but also solidifying his territory at the bottom. When struggling for life it is much better to attach yourself to your opponent's stone; a diagonal strike like this is usually reserved for reduction moves.]
;B[qj];W[op]C[TM: Good -- you saw that it was urgent to prevent black from taking this point.]
;B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[np];B[pn]
(;W[jp]C[XCMeijin: I've gotten a lot riskier lately with these kinds of contact moves but i find that i have unusually good success. Thoughts?

TM: This is a good idea, although in this case maybe too far for safety. In the game it worked out for you, but black could have offered stronger resistance. Consider the diagonal strike instead.]

(;B[kq]C[TM: This seems passive.];W[kp];B[ip];W[io];B[qd];W[hp]
;B[iq];W[hq];B[hr];W[gq];B[gr];W[go]C[TM: Although you let black take over much of the board, you managed to build up tremendous influence with this sequence. It now remains to be seen whether it can be put to good use.]

(;B[ck]C[XCMeijin: What do you think, how best to deal with this stone?

TM: Black is in far too deep here. Rather than invading such a strong white territory he should reduce it.

White, on the other hand, should cap this stone and drive it towards one of his thick groups.]

(;W[cl]C[TM: This is exactly what black needs to survive here: something to latch on to. White C8 is overconcentrated, too close to the thick group at the bottom.]
;B[dl];W[cm];B[ek];W[dj];B[cj]
(;W[el]C[TM: Black now has another target.];B[fl];W[dk];B[em]
;W[ci]LB[di:A][ej:B]C[XCMeijin: Gave the opponent a ponnuki, but i don't believe the situation is that bad. Thoughts?

TM: Hmm! You gave the opponent a ponnuki facing the centre, deep inside your own territory. The situation is bad.

You are also helping black by leaving the D10 group short of liberties. Extending to A or turning at B would deprive your opponent of the forcing move at B. You can come back for the C10 group later.]
;B[hn];W[ho];B[bg];W[bi];B[ej];W[di];B[fh]C[TM: After the last few forcing moves, black is dominating the centre.]
;W[md]C[XCMeijin: Another contact move. I felt i needed to be aggressive to get myself back on an even footing. If this move is bad, what alternatives do you suggest?

TM: The situation does call for something drastic! Black doesn't really have any targets for an attack, so you need to create one somehow. You managed to reclaim some of the centre influence, so well done.]
;B[mc]LB[ne:A][jf:B]C[TM: I think, though, that black was again too passive in defending your attack. He already has a lot of territory; he doesn't need to crawl along the third line. More interesting would be A or B, for example.]
;W[ld];B[lc];W[kd];B[kc];W[je];B[id];W[ie];B[ne];W[lf];B[ng]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gc];B[ic]TR[gc]C[TM: The last two moves are very small compared to what's at stake elsewhere!]
;W[rj]C[TM: This is wishful thinking though. If white struggles to make life here, it will only serve to solidify black's position.

On the other hand, black is firmly in the lead by now, so it is hard to see what white can do instead.]
;B[rk];W[pi];B[oi];W[oj];B[oh];W[qk];B[pk];W[rh];B[ql]LB[sj:A]
C[TM: Black could have forced at A first.]
(;W[si]C[XCMeijin: I think this was a mistake. See variation. After this I don't see any way I can live...]
;B[rf];W[re];B[qf];W[pf];B[qe];W[rg];B[sg];W[og];B[of];W[pg]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[mh];W[pd];B[qg]LB[qc:A]TR[ci]C[TM: This is a very strange move. Black is reducing his own liberties to kill a group that is already dead, thus giving white a forcing move and an opportunity to grab the corner. That makes this move worth about -15 points.

Better simply to play solidly at A. Also compare to move 60 (marked).]
;W[qc];B[od];W[pb];B[oc];W[rc];B[rd];W[ra];B[ob];W[pa]TR[rj]
C[XCMeijin: My only compromise, to live small in the corner.

TM: You got the corner, but was it worth it? After the sequence starting at move 84 (the marked stone), you get about 15 points in gote by living in the corner. Black, in exchange, gets yet more thickness and sente.]
;B[he];W[gd]LB[hf:A]TR[ec][gc][ed]C[TM: Your stones are overconcentrated; there isn't a territory to defend here. Your centre stones would be happier if you played at A instead, sacrificing the stone in atari.]
;B[hf];W[jh]
(;B[jj]TR[he][hf]C[XCMeijin: The sequence following from here was interesting. Comments?

TM: Black is playing away from his thickness; this is good. The key, I think, in the upcoming fight, is the marked group. These two stones are sitting beside a strong white group, so white should aim to cut them off while black should aim to connect them.]
;W[ij];B[ii];W[ji]
(;B[kj]C[XCMeijin: This was probably his mistake. My opponent and I reviewed this afterwards; see variations.]
;W[ik]
(;B[hi];W[hh];B[gh];W[hg]C[TM: Well played; you found the weak link in black's stones.]
;B[il];W[hl];B[jl];W[hm];B[hk];W[hj];B[gk];W[gi]C[XCMeijin [3k\]: i thought this was cool =)
ralphunden [4k\]: seems like very effective suicide moves :)
XCMeijin [3k\]: hehe];B[gj];W[ih];B[fi];W[gm];B[dm];W[fm];B[cn]
;W[en];B[el];W[bk]C[TM: Again, well done. This was an interesting fight and you managed to greatly reduce black's lead.]
;B[nn]C[XCMeijin: I think this stage was the nexus point; black is slightly ahead, and now i need some good moves  to get back ahead. Thoughts?]
;W[jk];B[kk];W[kl]LB[ll:A][ln:B]C[TM: This encourages black to complete a wall around a territory that is much larger than the two stones you are eating.

Consider peeping at A instead then falling back to B so that his territory is reduced.]
;B[ll];W[km];B[lm];W[ni]C[XCMeijin: Just trying to create possibilities...]
;B[nh]C[XCMeijin [3k\]: haha];W[lk];B[li];W[lj];B[ki];W[ln]
;B[kn];W[jm]
(;B[mn]C[XCMeijin: My opponent wondered if this was the right move, and we explored the possibility of M5. See variation.

TM: The variation looks good for black, although it would have been very hard to read out the sequence.]
;W[lo];B[lr]
(;W[mm]C[XCMeijin: This move didn't yield a good result, but i still believe i could've taken advantage of this position somehow. Am i blind? or is there no way?

TM: Well, at least you are persistent. :)  There is aji here, to be sure, but save it for ko threats.]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[nl];W[om];B[on];W[ol];B[mj];W[qm];B[ok];W[rm]
;B[dr]C[TM: Result: black strengthened his stones around P6 and took sente.]
;W[cr];B[er];W[ro];B[qo];W[rp];B[rq];W[sk];B[rl];W[sl];B[sp]
C[XCMeijin: This ALMOST worked.... could this have worked some other way?

TM: You are dead; it makes no sense to play here. I would actually say that at the 3 kyu level, this kind of play amounts to wasting the time of your opponent (and the reviewer ... !)]

Thanks again for taking time to review!

TM: This was an interesting game. It is impressive that you managed to almost break even at the end after the opening!

My advice to both players is to work on invasions. In this game both white and black made very deep plays inside the opponent's territory; you have to be able to judge how far is reasonable given the situation. When dealing with an invasion into your own territory, play away from your thickness and try to make your opponent's stones heavy.

For white, practise your fuseki. Establish a presence around the board before your opponent takes it all.

Also, don't try to live with dead stones. You will only destroy aji and make it that much harder to find room to manoeuvre and find life for your groups that actually have a chance.

As for black, don't be so greedy! You would have had a straightforward win (50+) had you not tried to eat everything in sight.

I hope this helps!
