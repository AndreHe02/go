C[Hi, glad to comment you.


Your major things to perform : 
- always keep in mind : first coners, then sides, and only after corner.
- give up some few stones it's no point(1-4 points), and go build big sides instead (15 points).
- keep connected, and don't let you be cut. 
- try to see what's the priority considering : first corners, then sides, and only after center. It should help you a lot when you don't know what to play. (ex. :  give up 2 center stones to build on the side)

All the game was about those few points.];B[pd]C[Hi



Hi, i'm Bloud5 and this is my recent game on KGS. It's the first game i post on GTL, so i'm not really sure about this.
Also sorry about my bad english :)
The whole game i thought i was losing, i mean really losing, but in the end, i won by 0.5 points just because Michiru made some weird moves in the yose. and then he capitulated..

Please comment anything you like, and see how the game ended.
Thank you so much for you reviewing this game.
Well, good luck then! :)];W[ep];B[dc]C[well i had to answer someplace else then on the 4-4 point just for him to see that i can play it :D]
;W[pp]
(;B[ic];W[de];B[ce]C[and now..i was afraid he would disconnect my stones by playing C16, just wanted to try it out, what will happen. Was this move of mine wrong?..]

(;W[df]
(;B[dd];W[ed];B[ec];W[fd]
(;B[di]CR[pj][jq]TR[ce]C[Here 2 things :

- If you would have played around  : here to far from the side. Your strongest stone on that side is on the 3rd line, always play on the same line your stones are on. 

- i wouldn't have played on that side cause white has his own stone on it. At forst in a game : take the coner, then the sides. Here 2 sides were still free (i marked them) : play where you have the most place]
;W[cf]TR[ce][di]C[Here you just se why your move wasn't good : white separat your stones. Your d11 stone seems very weak now.]

(;B[ff]C[


"well i didn't really know what i was trying to do.. :)" 

In fact, threating a cut, always forces, white to protect it and to renforce. Not really a good move. If you don't play it, you maybe could use it to cut in the middle game, you don't know : so don't waste those moves.]
;W[ee];B[be]TR[pj][dm][jq]C[not the priority to close that corner.

Those moves are much bigger : while sides are free : take them ! and if a stone is in danger : help it (d7)]
;W[fc];B[fb]TR[di][pj][dm][jq]C[same here : not the priority]
;W[gb];B[fa];W[hc];B[hd];W[id];B[hb];W[gc]TR[hb][ic][kc][mc]
[pd]C[here you're cut

The more important is to take point safely. I would have tried to use atari to form a group here.]

(;B[ie]C[ok and now i wanted to stop his group from coming to life, thought that maybe wasn't a really smart idea :D]
;W[jd]CR[lb][id][kd][ld][md]TR[ie]C[By playing j15 you force white to renforce on the top side  : if white make a wall with his white stones, it will be hard for you to take the points on the top side cause white will be in place. Choose the atari that makes you secure points and renforce your own stones (k16 instead of j15)]
;B[ib];W[he]
(;B[hf];W[ge];B[fe]SQ[pj][jq]C[Then the "whole" game was about this thing : saving one stone. All the game, was battle for 2 or 3 points instaed to take sides, where you can have settled a lot of points. Beginners have difficulties to give up one stone (one point) to settle 15 points somewhere else). Hard to do when we begin, but always keep in mind when you don't what to play : forst the corners, then the sides and after the center. Here corners are all taken. Sides : 2 are still free. So play something to catch one.]

SQ[if][fg][hg]C[by answering at the contact of white stones, you are creating weakness(marked place), cutting points that will help white.Don't try to kill white. The aim of the game is to build more points than white, not to kill him. Here white used 16 stones to create no points. And you got a whole corner. You're leading for now if you don't create weakness. Just focus on building points, sacrifie 4 stones if needed, it's only 4 points.]

(;W[fi];B[ef]LB[ic:3][eg:1][gg:2]C[Now you have 3 separated groups to save. White has only one . It will be hard to save 3 groups with only one move to play at your turn. Now the stones you should have given up at the start are too big to be given up now : no more 4 points : 15 points at least. That's why you have to give them up when it's not a big group that will be hard to save after.]
;W[ga]C[cut.];B[eb];W[kb]TR[bh][di][dl][bn]C[now. Still the same rules. Corners are taken, after comes the sides. Here you have one side to save (too much stones  if it is killed) .
You have to give your stone some space to create easily after your eyes. Playing d8 for example.]

Take one, where you have the most place.];B[gp]C[now, don't atack the stones. Play where you have th most place. Cause if white decides to attack, he already ahev 2 stones more around, aginst one of your : battle will be easier for him.]
