C[### my pleasure.  Lots of life and death, try gobase.org, under study, go problems, korean problem academy. 

You are not seeing the weaknesses in moyo's.  Try invading more often, cutting, then cut some more.  Go crazy, give huge handicaps.  

If you wish to get stronger, playing and solving life and death Daily will yeild the best results.  Try 3 game a day, and 50 problems.  Give more time when you can.   Run for as long as you can, then take a break.  Play a game here and there to maintain your skill, then push hard again.  At 9k and stronger also start to review pro games.  

Give a holler on KGS sometime if you want to play.

Any suggestions?

Thank you for your time])
