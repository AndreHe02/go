(;W[rg]LB[og:a]C[Joseki calls for 'a'.  See variation];B[qg]
;W[pg];B[og];W[ph];B[oh];W[qh]LB[jg:a]C[This is too good for B.  W20 has to follow joseki. A move around 'a' will give B a big moyo.]
;B[qi]LB[ri:a]C[This is too small at this stage.  If it really stopped W from advancing done the side it would be better but it does not: W can still play at 'a' and B cannot block.]

(;W[qm]LB[qn:a][rh:b][sf:c][ri:d][jp:e][jd:f]C[This is completely the wrong direction.  Even if it were thew right direction, 'a' would be better.  There is not much to play for on this side.  With B7 and 27 played W cannot expect much from this side. so ther eis no reason to play there.  Conversely, neither can B expect much, as he would have to exchange 'a' for 'b' before doing anything, but that exchange then leave B cramped if he approaches at 'a' because w still has 'd' in sente.

'e' is the best point on the lower half of the board, but that give B the chance to form a large moyo at the top.  I would play at 'f'  as should in the variation.]
;B[cn]
(;W[dk]LB[gq:a]C[This seems a little unreasonable in view of Bs thickness.  If B responds by jumping out and then pincering W could get into trouble.  I prefer the variation at 'a']
;B[cq]LB[en:a][fp:b][gn:c][hp:d][dh:e][fk:f][fh:g][hk:h]C[The variation 'a'-'g' looks more interesting]
;W[dq]LB[jp:a][cp:b]C[Wrong side.  This joseki ends in gote for W (see comments about top right) and so W needs to have a stone in place at 'a' to play this.  W must intercept at 'b' and make thickness so as to counter B's thickness,]
;B[cp];W[do];B[dn];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[bq];W[bn];B[ap];W[en]
;B[bm]LB[em:a]C[As sted earlier, this has to be at 'a' to retain sente.]
;W[cm];B[dm];W[em];B[dl];W[el];B[cl];W[jp]LB[id:a]C[This is necessary.  If we now look at the board the bottom left and top right can be evaluated as amost equal except that B27 adds to B's position.  So the question is one of evaluating the top left and bottom right.  If B5 were at 'a', I would judg eB to be slighty better because he has sente, but as it is the fact the W can press down on B5 gives W the edge, even though B has sente.  however, it is very close.]
;B[ek];W[ed]LB[jd:a]C[This is too deep.  B's cut at 51 makes this move a difficult fight for w.  Reducing at 'a' looks  more promising.]
;B[df]C[This works too well with the cut at 51];W[cc];B[bc]
;W[dc];B[bb];W[gc]C[W's position is too cramped.  In the space of 7 moves game has turned very sour for W.  His chances do not look so good now.]
;B[ie];W[ff]C[This is a funny looking move.  It provokes B to protect the left side without getting anything in return]

;B[hg];W[fh];B[fg];W[gi];B[gf];W[hf]LB[ib:a]C[This does not see mto have much chance of success.  I think that leaving the ko for later and living at the top is the more prudent approach.  I would attach at 'a'.]
;B[gh];W[bd]LB[ce:a][be:b][dd:c][ad:d][bf:e]C[This is just not big enough.  the only followup W has is Wa thru Be.  this exchanges on ko for another, but resolving the center ko will almost certainly kill the W group in the center and so is bigger.]
;B[be];W[gg];B[rh];W[sf];B[gh];W[dd]C[Same as before. B should connect.]
;B[ad];W[gg];B[eo]LB[fo:a]C[Now W is in a quandary because B has many threats here.  However, giving up the 3 stones including w42 just cannot be done if W is to win. In addition, if B next plays 'a' the 4 stones below ar effectively dead. (see later comment)]
;W[ge];B[fo]
(;W[gq]LB[oe:a]C[This does not save the 4 W stones and so serves littlew purpose.  W's best chance now it to use the aji of the cut at 'a' the engineer an attack upon B5 and B59 - prospects are not good.

Even if W plays 'b', the position is still bad - see varation.]
;B[eq];W[pq]LB[oq:a][jd:b][id:c][nd:d][ne:e][me:f]C['a' is better shape with regard to the corner, but either move is too slow.  W is way behind in this game and cannot possibliy win without starting a big fight somewhere abd hoping to make something of it. I would start by playing Wb, Bc, Wd, Be, Wf, but B need not resist so strong.  He can still win by giving way some.]
;B[lp]LB[oi:a]C[If this stone lives the game is over.  W can only capture this stone my exploting the aji of the dead stones to the left and the cut at 'a']
;W[jn]LB[kn:a]C[Not forceful enough - this is a running move, not an attacking move.  'a' is better.]
;B[ln];W[hm]LB[mo:a][lo:b][kl:c][oi:d]C[This neither threatens anything, nor gains anything.  It is a dame point in the middle of a critical battle.  W's one slender chance is to ecchange 'a' for 'b' and then press at 'c', hopeing to exploit the cut at 'd']
;B[gm]C[Unneccesary.  thwe four W stones below are captured to the B stones at 97 and 9 are in no danger.  The 5 B stones above can easily move out and help the 2 stones the right.  Don't forget that, unless W defends B can paly this later.  If W pulls out the 3 stones B gets two moves elsewhere and seals the win.]
;W[fr]C[Again, unnecessary.  Now that B107 is on the board, pulling these 4 stones out it not that big.]
;B[er];W[lq]C[completely the wrong direction.  If these two B stones don't dies W has no chance.  He must swallow them whole.]
;B[mq];W[mp];B[kq];W[lo];B[kp];W[ko];B[jq];W[lr];C[W should resign at this stage.]

[pk:c][qk:d][oj:e][rh:f][jd:g]C[This is the standard joseki sequence.  The critical difference from the line played in the game is that W ends in sente.  Later, B has forcing moves at any of 'a' thru 'e'., each one threatening to play 'f' .  See any joseki book for the continuations..    If this variation is followed this does not look as apealing for B as it would if B5 were at 'g'.  Not only does W have sente, but he can play at 'g' to nullify Bs wall.  One must therefore question the wisdom of playing B7.]
