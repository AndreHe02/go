;W[qp];B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[jp];W[nc];B[kd]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kb];B[jc]C[I think 19 at j16 is more consistent with the high moves on the bottom and the opportunity to build a big area of influence in the upper left and along the left - a play around D10]
;W[qh];B[ph];W[qi];B[qg]C[ok, but it leaves B still not fully settled, so it depends on what you want here]
;W[qb]C[decision time - settle the group, run to the center, or play elsewhere.  I favor the last choice -again looking to the left side to build a big framework in the upper left corner.]
;B[ql]C[Small and leads to a fight with two B groups and 1 white group.  Compare to a big move on the left side or even approaching the w corner.  Also, if B stablizes the b group on the right, W needs to respond for the two stones.  So you can almost protect the group in sente.]
;W[ok]C[Still ignore this and play the big point - worry about your one stone much later.  In this situation W will need to worry about it in every move w makes on the board.  That is worth a lot.

If you are going to respond, I lik Q10 - splitting W and playing consistently to the outside.  This force W to either save the two stones or have one drifting in the middle.]
;B[ol]C[This makes w stronger for attacking the two b groups.  Not what you want here.]
;W[pk];B[pl]C[Now W gets good shape, the black stones are heavy, and the upper bl group needs more attention.  This wil lead to W having the outside influence - completely inconsistent with the opening B moves.]
;W[oi];B[nf];W[oe];B[of]C[B is gettin heavy while making w stronger and settled.  Not really what b wants to do here.]
;W[rk];B[rl];W[rh];B[fq]C[Don't leave the fight now - B is not settled.  A play around m14 is huge here - creating outside influence and sealing the upper w group in while protecting the b side group.]
;W[cn];B[cj]C[OK.  But think of this move having been played before the right side was played.  Think of how much it would affect what you decide on the right.]
;W[hq]C[Interesting choice by W - but what is happening here is not 10 points either way on the bottom - you should understand this - and look to the framework on the upper left - making sense of k17.]
;B[hp];W[gq];B[dq];W[gp];B[cp];W[do];B[cr];W[jr];B[nr];W[lp]
C[Lots of fighting things in this series.  Kinda too many things to talk about.  It seems both sides are very afraid of giving the other any points at all and it seems both are playing very tactically, very small, rather than thinking about the large scale.  

I think B would have been much better off to have taken the 15-20 points on the bottom and had a simple group, leave in sente and strengthen your upper left.

50 is a good move to create complexities. But it leaves W with many groups getting weaker and weaker.]
;B[kq]C[I think the attach at L3 is better here, but the fight is complex no matter what.]
;W[lq];B[kr];W[lr];B[ir];W[fp];B[ns]C[This is the first move that could be comsidered a losing move by B.  Much better would be to connect under, or threaten to, with L1 or M1.]
;W[ks];B[jq];W[ln];B[js];W[ls];B[qr]C[Notice how many groups each side has.  No one can keep track of this many groups or see what is going to happen or even what is best to happen.  I will play this way when I need to make things so complex that the only chance I have is that the other side can't figure it out either.

This does make sense of O1 and the wall along the 8th line.

But look at how many b groups are not yet settled. 5.];W[rr]
;B[ro]C[Once again, inconsistent - attacking from both sides with little prospect of getting points or killing the group.]
;W[pr];B[ps];W[rn];B[qo];W[qq];B[qs];W[po];B[oo];W[rs];B[pn]
;W[pp];B[qm];W[rp];B[lo];W[mo];B[ko];W[mp];B[mn];W[nn];B[mm]
;W[on];B[pm];W[no];B[nm];W[os];B[kp];W[or];B[km]C[settles two black groups and gets outside influence.  And w has two weak groups and the b framework to be concerned about.  So black has good prospects here.]
;W[nl];B[om];W[ho]C[A bit small for W I think.  W needs to think a bit bigger here.  But settling the group will free w for bigger attacks later.]
;B[jb]C[Too small.  E10, M14, C17, are all much better, though this the right kind of move - if you were thinking about the top left more than attacking the strong w group.]
;W[lc]C[Too small for W here.];B[rb]C[W is alive, B isn't.  Bad idea.  S16 is right here, or M14.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[qe];B[pe];W[rg];B[sd];W[se];B[me];W[md];B[oc]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[ob];B[od];W[nd];B[le]C[Again, a good result for B.  B is now about 30 points ahead.  But B keeps ending in gote to get the strong positions - so this is really not quite as good as it seems.]
;W[sc];B[qf]C[Too small  This is not waht is important here for B or W.  THe prior W move was meaningless in this game and should have been ignored.]
;W[re];B[qa];W[mb];B[mh]C[Think Bigger.  Notice how a move around H10 commands control every direction.]
;W[oh];B[mj]C[OK.  Sealing W in, building the framework even larger.  But notice how C17 or F10 makes things even larger and more settled and more difficult for W.]
;W[cc]C[Now, which way?  Blocking to push W along the top is right - push W toward your strongest group.  LEave with sente to take a big point around E9 or F9  - makes the whole box strong on all sides.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[de];W[be];B[bf];W[ad]
;B[hm]C[W made a mistake by trying to play both sides here and you get to block w in both sides.

35 is wrong - the move to take the big space is F8 or F9.  I like F9 - since you are so far ahead.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[em];B[ip];W[eq];B[gn];W[fn];B[er];W[fr];B[gm]
;W[ek]C[And now W will completely lay waste to the B center.

So here B 135 was the  the losing move, perhaps.  

Then after 36, you still should play around F10 to look after the large framework.  You still won't keep it all, but you would keep enough.  Since the other B groups are now safe, look to attack or taking points.  No w groups can be really attacked after B35, W36, so look to points.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[el];B[dm]C[Ouch.  W is still giving you E10!  Huge!]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[en];B[go];W[eo];B[ej]C[Amazing that W gave you all this!  But now W is nearly fully settled and so can attack and try to reduce with impunity -B's choices are now limited.]
;W[fj];B[fi];W[ei];B[dj];W[gi];B[fh];W[hj];B[gk];W[gj]C[let's count.

w = 40, maybe?

b = 60+

So, b should settle things here.  b G8 is sente - w must connect.  B settles the b groups and taks about 16-24 points solid.  Then B can settle the lower left corner for another 8 points.  Then B gets at least 30 points from the top left and top and upper right center.

So play simply here.];B[fk]C[another "losing move.  Playing solidly at G8 simplifies everything and avoids all the complications of later.]
;W[gl]C[Even now, give up the two stones.];B[hk];W[hl];B[ik]
C[Not much to talk about now.  The huge loss of the 6 stones almost changes things.  B is still ahead, but now W has chances.]
;W[im]C[Until this point, you were not playing a come-from-behind game.  You were way ahead.  So it seems your weakness is in assessing what you need to do and in assessing the value of territorial frameworks as opposed to solid territory.]
;B[jk];W[bp];B[bq];W[es];B[bo];W[dr];B[cq];W[bn];B[cm]C[Just live in the corner.  DOn't make things complex.]
;W[bl];B[bm];W[am];B[bk];W[ao];B[ap];W[bs];B[cs];W[ar];B[an]
;W[kn];B[jn];W[ao];B[co];W[aq];B[an];W[lm]C[capture the three q stones.]
;B[al];W[ll]C[Now you have been cut to shreads and it is almost a lost game.  But if you cut off the right side group, you are still in it, so the choice you make next is correct.]
;B[jm];W[mk];B[ml]C[But this is not.  Just play M10 and take the huge number of points above.  It is over 60 points all alone - even the w right is not enough to balance this.]

(;W[lk];B[nk];W[nj];B[ni]C[The ko fight is going to be tough for B here.  almost no Ko threats of meaning.]
;W[nl];B[bd];W[nk]C[Now tough - take corner and see if you can get enough points in the center.]

;W[gc];B[hd];W[fb];B[ec];W[bc]C[What is the killing point here?  Or is it Ko?

Capture, then what?];B[ac];W[ab]C[now B19 to kill - w can't get a second eye on the outside. e19, b h18 takes care of it all.]
