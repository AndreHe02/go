C[Hello

I am white in this game. I narrowly won it thanks to an endgame blunder from my opponent. My opponent, however, dictated the entire pace of the game. He allowed me to get a lot of territory, but his thickness and influence gave him control of the game. Alternatively, if my strategy was correct, perhaps my sabaki skills are not strong enough. Any advice is welcomed. I have also added some questions at various points in the game.

thanks
Chris

BB: No one's sabaki skills are strong enough. Questions are good. Always have questions, and even when you don't have questions, tell the reviewer what you were thinking about the moves. Yours and your opponent's.]

;B[lq];W[qn]C[I'm never sure if a double 3-3 is better against a sanrensai (assuming a double low 1 space pincer)?

BB: You're right to treat o3 lightly. O3 was a good move, because if Black defended the right side, with R6 say, he'd be overconcentrated and you could move to say K4 and have an efficient framework on the lower side. Black played m3 hoping you would play r3 like in the top right, because then he would have, not just a moyo, but real territory, and not overly concentrated.

This move stops that.];B[np];W[mp]C[BB: Why? This is the kind of move I'd like a comment about.]

(;W[po]C[I don't know if this is a good result - it's weakened the moyo on the right, but its very nice shape for black on the bottom, and with sente

BB: From n4, Black played the obvious move at every point. And this is really bad for you. In sente, maybe it would be okay. No, still not, because Black's sente endgame play at q2 is huge, and that's only if he doesn't find a better way to capitalise on the cutting aji at r4. In fact it's so bad, I think you'd have been better off playing r3 here.]
;B[fq]C[BB: Actually, Black is too strong for this area to be interesting. Black should play on the other side, around C6. Then D4 would be under pressure. This way, life for White is easy and Black is overconcentrated at the bottom. This goes against the principle of "play away from thickness."]
;W[cn];B[fo];W[jo]C[an overplay?

BB: Definitely not, because you have no weak groups. Like I said, Black's play made life easy for your lower left group.

However, this might not be the right point. When playing inside your opponent's territory, you need to either be able to escape easily, or to "aim at specific weakness". Here, Black k7 would make your escape uncomfortable, to say the least (I haven't looked but I hope that's where he plays). But nor are you aiming specificly at the only weakness - Black's semi-isolated stones on the left and the potential cutting point between them.]
;B[iq]C[BB: Okay, you won this exchange. This is a horribly passive move by Black. As long as you can get responses like j3 from your opponents, keep playing moves like K5.]
;W[dj]C[I'm happy that black has answered K5 so passively so I'll treat K5 as a forcing move.

BB: Damn right :) This is a nice move, too. I like it. d2 is also big, but possibly a little too endgame (in that it's not strategic).]
;B[fd]C[BB: Seems too close, but perhaps it's not, and it's just a good move. Still, o18 is threatening the territory at the top - I don't think you have to pincer this.]

(;W[df]C[BB: I think this is okay. You'll have enough opportunities to get into the top area.]
;B[nn]C[BB: I'll go back a move and see if you'd played here...]
;W[hd]C[BB: I'd prefer taking territory with f17. That way, you get territory while messing up Black. This way, you get less territory, you mess up Black's but his was going to be messed up anyway.]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[cb];B[ff]C[BB: Urkh! You get minor territory and Black gets a weak stone to attack.]
;W[hf]C[BB: Weak stone becomes weak group.];B[fh];W[dh]C[Very risky I know. Staking my game on being able to get some of my central stones to live. Is there an alternative strategy I could have followed?

BB: Yes! Make a living group in the centre! You're strong in the top left and the bottom left - Black d12 would just take a little territory, and you'd still have a weak point to attack at e13.]
;B[hh]C[BB: This is great for Black. A move like f9 for Black would now make a great moyo. But nor can you afford to play there yet.]

(;W[le]C[BB: The proverb says "cut at the waist of the knights move". That would be m16 here (see var.)]
;B[md]C[This was a poor exchange

BB: This was okay, but m16 would have been better, because it would create a cutting point.]
;W[ih]C[BB: Your sabaki is not too bad, I think.];B[hg]
(;W[if]C[BB: Actually I think you should let Black cut. See var.

Yeah, having added the variation, I like that much more.];B[ig]
C[BB: You've got to feel really bad about this. j12 is worse than useless now.]
;W[kf]C[BB: This one workse well. It's nice shape. Now I hope you can feel the value of m15.]

(;B[mg]C[BB: I think I'd have played k15.];W[kh]C[BB: Also good.]
;B[jg]C[BB: Obviously this is what you wanted.];W[kg]C[BB: Yes, you're nicely connected now.]
;B[gc]C[BB: What? Why?]
(;W[hc]C[BB: Why? Do you think you have territory here? Or even eyes? Why not try l17 instead.]
;B[jc]C[BB: Exactly! What did you expect? Rather than exchange h17 for k17, you may as well have played l9 or so.]
;W[mh]C[BB: This is good. because you got no shape at the top, you still need these kinds of moves, though I expect Black will get something at the right from this.]
;B[ng];W[nh]C[BB: What if Black plays m12?];B[og]C[BB: Oh this is so timid. Black must really think he's winning. He should at least play p12! (But I still prefer m12)]
;W[lk];B[pr];W[qq];B[km]C[BB: And why not. You can't expect to have both sides.]
;W[lm];B[ln];W[mm]
(;B[lo]C[very solid play from black

BB: Unnecessarily so. See var.];W[ol]C[BB: This is a wasted move. You may as well pass. How about s10 or d2. If you really think you're weak, play l8, which strengthens you and is probably sente.]
;B[ql]C[BB: Right idea, but should probably be r12 (imagine White q11 now). Actually, why not play q11 now?]
;W[jm]C[I didn't realize that R8 was threatening to cut me off]
;B[kl]C[BB: Evidently. This commits you to saving k5.];W[kn]
C[BB: You should probably run away first and cut only if Black doesn't take gote to connect.]

;B[pk];W[jj];B[gl];W[gm]C[BB: Should be at f6.];B[je];W[nk]
C[I don't believe I can play K14

BB: Nor do I, so this is a good move, but I guess k15 wasn't.]
;B[jf]C[BB: The White stones cut off are big, but it cost Black two moves - gote twice.]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[fl];B[hj];W[oi];B[pi];W[eq]C[BB: I'd have this at d2, though this could work if you can use it to attack.]

I know I still had a ko threat at E15, but black had many more threats than me, so I had no chance to win the ko fight.]

BB: I'd like to know how many points you think you are behind. I'll count for myself... If l19 lives, I'd say it's close to even. But even if it wasn't, you should play out the top before resigning, if only because it has opportunities for Black to make a mistake (such as h17 escaping).

But if you did lose this game (and you did), I'd say e3 was the losing move.
