C[Hello Alberto,
here come comments on the game you played on IGS.

It is a little bit of a pity, that you sent a game, were you had a weaker
oponent and were you had a clear win. I think you can learn much more from
games against stronger oponents, which you lost.
In this game you made some mistakes, but your oponent never punished you
for those. So you might find it hard to believe that those were wrong
moves (after all they worked out!).

At some points of the game there were missed oportunities by both players.
But it is hard to tell what you can learn from that. It is quite natural
that one misses oportunities at every level of playing strength (apart
from the very top).

Maybe there are three things you could learn:
1) Sometimes you just played on the wrong side of the board. Try to think
about these situations.
2) Think about the Kos which appeared in the game (or might have
appeared). How big were they? E.g what happens if white wins it, what
happens if black wins it. Are they worth it? Note: usually winning a Ko
means, that your oponent gets 2 moves elsewhere. Maybe 2 moves elsewhere
is bigger then winning the Ko?
One of the Kos you could have won in sente. Think about what a huge
difference that makes!
3) Try to have a picture in mind during the game, who is leading. If you
are leading your strategy should be different from your strategy when you
are behind.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask back.

Ciao,
Bernhard];B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pq];B[qo];W[qk]C[BH: I would not play a pincer here. Blacks correct answer would be
O5 now. Then you would have to answer at the  lower edge (N3 is Joseki), and black
gets the perfect move R11 (or R12) which is a strong pincer against
your stone + an extension from Q16

P4 or O4 would be better instead of your pincer at R9];B[qq]
C[BH: With this move black looks for life in the corner. This is not
good here.];W[po]C[BH: This move is not good. Black should play Q4 now and after P4-R4
white has to many cuts, and black has got to much and the pincer stone
at R9 looks misplaced.

Whites correct move is R2 here. White would then develop along the
lower edge, and black gets to live at the right side.];B[pn]
C[BH: Gives away the chance Q4, and leaves the good move R4 to you]
;W[qp]C[BH: good];B[rp];W[pp];B[qn]C[What white is supposed to do now?
White must take the stone R3 or do something in the lower side?
M3 or N5 are good ideas?

BH: Your move S3 is good. It gives you safe territory in the corner +
thickness facing left];W[rq];B[nn];W[ro];B[rn]C[what about this exchange(S5-S6)? It's better to avoid it?

BH:I would not play this exchange. I do not see much advantage from
it. But it is also not a big mistake.];W[ok]C[BH: This move looks bad. But it seems your oponent does not
want to punish you, when you make a  weaker move. Black should play R12, and your stones would become
the target of a strong attack. You should play at R12 or R13
yourself. In addition (and this happens in the game):  if you move with your stones toward the center,
black will move out with his stones along the 6th line. This weakens
the effect your stones Q3,Q4,Q5 have on the lower side. It would be
better to leave the lower side alone for the time being.];B[oo]
;W[nq];B[jp]C[I suppose tha at this point withe must get out, it`s true?
Something like N5?
BH: No. The board is wide open. In this situation it is not so important
to move out with your safe group. Note: If you move out you would not
move into black territory or black sphere of influence.
Now a move like Q13 or R14 or R13 is urgent. My feeling is,
you are thinking to much about attacking the black group on the 6th
line. You should only attack when your groups are safe. So: First do
something for your stones P9/R9. Then: Either he defends his stones
with a move like N4: This is a move on neutral ground and you can be
happy, and look for big points elsewhere on the board.
Or: he doesnt defend. Then you can attack with M4.];W[mk];B[mp]
C[Now must white push whith N3 or it`s better to play tenuki?
BH: Still R14 is much more urgent. after your N3 Black should play at
R12. The exchange N3-M3 is good for you.];W[mq];B[lq];W[pf]
C[BH: Finally you made the urgent move. Now your position looks
superior];B[of];W[oe]C[BH: I would play P13 or even Q13 here. If Black played Q15 now
then the fight should be bad for you.];B[qf]C[BH: Mistake by black]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[pc];W[oc];B[pj];W[pk];B[qh]C[BH: Another mistake. Q13 is the right move]
;W[pg]C[BH: Good];B[ph];W[qg]C[BH: Good. Black will have to come back to defend against all
those cuts];B[rg];W[nh];B[ri];W[jd]C[I don't fully understand what happend in the upper rigth
corner (Q16) it`s even?  there have been big mistakes from one part
or the other?

BH: The result is good for white. You got an impressive moyo at the
top. For that you gave away your prospective territory on the right,
and gave Black a big corner. But your moyo is worth more.];B[gq]
C[BH:Very bad move. The last very big point was  D10];W[dj]
C[BH:Very good. I would say: the game is over now. You got such a
big moyo on the top. Black has nothing comparable];B[fc];W[ec]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[ib];W[fd];B[fb];W[id];B[eb];W[db]C[BH: Yes. No mistake so far. You kept Black small]
;B[kb]C[BH: This looks like an endgame move to me. It is still a little
early for that. Black must play D8];W[jb];B[ja];W[lc]C[BH: Endgame move.  Moves like J9 or C6 or D6 look better to
me. In any case you will not keep much territorry on the upper
edge. So: Look for territory elsewere. But ok: you got the lead, and
you keep the lead.];B[mb];W[lb];B[la];W[nb]C[BH: P18 is better. It also deprives Black of eyes in this area,
but it gives much bigger threads in the corner.];B[mc];W[md]
;B[gd]C[BH: H16 looks better to me.];W[hc]C[BH: Good];B[hb]
;W[hd];B[gc];W[ge];B[ga];W[ia]C[BH: Very good. Maybe slightly bad timing, as there are even
bigger moves elsewhere on the board. See my later remark.];B[ea]
;W[ka]C[BH: A good Ko for you. The point is: if you win the Ko you
play K19. This threatens the black group on the top. So black might
answer at H19, and you would win the Ko in Sente!];B[fe];W[ed]
C[I think that now it`s to early to play this Ko, rigth?
BH: You mean E15? You are right E15 would be a big
mistake. First of all you are already playing a Ko. You cannot win 2
Kos. Secondly: The stone at F15 can be nearly considered as dead
(it was meant as a Ko-threat!). There is
absolutely no point in playing a onesided Ko with E15. It would be a
very bad and unnecessary Ko for you. This Ko would be particularily
bad, as the result if white wins the Ko by capturing at D17 the reult
would be a disaster for you.  For the question, if one wants to play Ko or not, it is very important
to consider: 1) what is the outcome if black wins the Ko,  2) what is the outcome if white wins the Ko]
;B[ja];W[pb];B[qb];W[ka];B[gf];W[he];B[ja];W[qd]C[BH: This Ko thread is not ideal. It costs you a big endgame
(e.g. at S18): It erases the weaknesses in blacks corner. I would
probably play D6 (another option: M4)];B[qc];W[ka];B[pa]C[BH: Mistake by Black. You should ignore it and play K19. White
answers H19 and you could still answer at P18 (but P18 looks small to
me anyway. D6 is much bigger). But it seems you dont see that K19 is
sente against his group.];W[ob];B[ja];W[rd];B[re];W[ka];B[cc]
;W[dc];B[ja];W[se];B[rf];W[ka];B[cb];W[da];B[ja];W[cq]C[BH: This is not good. Is it meant as a Ko threat? if you invade
the corner black gets strong on the outside, and this will have quite
a bad affect on your moyo. Why dont you just work to make your moyo
more big and more safe? If you are looking for Ko threads, why not
continue in the upper right corner with S17];B[dq];W[cp];B[ce]
C[BH: It seems the Ko is not very interesting to both of you anymore. If
it is not interesting why did you play all these moves in the upper
right corner? It might be true that the Ko you were playing is not so
important, and that there are bigger moves elsewhere at the board
(especially if you do not see that you would win the Ko in sente). But
that means: your good move J19 was badly timed. One can keep a move
like this in reserve. If black sees this move and plays J19 himself,
that just means he invested one more move and you can be happy and
play elsewhere.];W[df];B[bg];W[cd];B[bd];W[be]C[BH: I would rather play F14 or E14, to keep your center big. A few
points in the corner are not worth is. Also: After F14 you still have
B15 (or better:B17) in reserve.];B[bf];W[bc];B[ae];W[bb];B[dg]
C[I think I must not play tenuki now.
But I did not found a good way to attak the weak black group.
I thougth about B11, what do you think of this move?
BH: Tenuki is fine. The black group is not really weak. It has plenty
of eye potential and can still move in two directions. The whole fight
here was bad for you, but as you can take sente and play elsewhere, it
is not so bad. C6 is good];W[cn];B[ci];W[cj];B[ef];W[do];B[eo]
;W[en];B[fn];W[de];B[eh];W[fo];B[ep];W[fm];B[gn];W[gm];B[hn]
;W[hg];B[gg];W[hh];B[em];W[dn];B[el];W[fk];B[fj];W[gk];B[nl]
;W[nk]C[BH:All this was well played by White.  Now it is time for a
pause and a count: Black has less then 30 points on the lower edge,
less then 20 points in the upper right and about 10 points elsewhere
and no prospective territory nowhere else. Black got about 15 points in
the lower right 25 points in the lower left and 7 points in the upper
left. + prospective territory in the center. If you do the count you
realize you only need 15 more points in the center for a safe win. So:
cutting of the center with O13 and O14 is enough for a safe win. You
would get certainly much more then 20 points there.];B[oh];W[lp]
;B[lo];W[lr];B[kq];W[ei]C[I was hoping this move (E11) was sente.
BH: Well: it is not really. You can gain a little bit by catching  the F10 stone. But certainly not as much as you are loosing on the
other side of the center.];B[og];W[fh];B[fi]C[BH: Bad move. Because of Blacks weak responses you are getting
really  a lot from your E11 play. Black should maybe play D11 and
after you defend a cut Black should play Tenuki again. E.g. Black
could play N14 which is Sente, as I will explain later. I would still
say: all your actions on this part of the board are risking your
win. If your oponent would suddenly turn to a 6k* you would probably
loose now. If you would have played on the other side of the center to
get your sure win, the 6k* might well resign.];W[gh];B[mf];W[dh]
C[I supposed also this move was sente.
BH: Sure. But Black N14 was also Sente: Black should take the next
oportunity to play M16. If you play L17 black can play O16 and I do
not see a way for you to safe your 11 stones on the right. Both of you
overlooked that. Even if white does not answer the atari M16 with L17
it is hard to find a way for the 11 stones to escape.

I guess Black must answer your D12 at C12];B[eg]C[White C12 is wrong?
I think it`s better to connect at D11, rigth?
BH: C12 is very good. Whites next move is wrong. I think, that
after C12 with best play a lot of  black stones get captured]

(;W[ch];B[bi]C[BH:I guess Black must play B12 to ensure life for part of his
group and white then cuts at C13, then Black C14 white D11 Black M16 :-)

locally White should play D11 now. You either get the cut at C13 or
all the black stones will be in danger. Here is one variation if black
defends the cut.]
(;W[bh];B[di]C[I did not see this move :-)
BH: Of course you must answer here at E10.  Black should take the oportunity and capture that stone and start a
huge fight. Here you are
risking your win again];W[bj]C[BH: Black should capture at E10. A big fight for the center
could start then. It is not clear, who would have the better end. It
would give Black a chance to fight back in a game which was already
lost. If you thengive atari at A11... well I give you some
variations.]
(;B[ai];W[ej];B[cf]C[I think now, black must play A12 instead, to capture the three  withe stones and live.
BH: Right];W[ah];B[ag];W[aj];B[cg];W[kf];B[le]C[BH: Still M16 followed by O16 would be a great combination for
black. But both of you overlooked that];W[ne];B[mg];W[lh];B[ha]
;W[kc];B[ld]C[BH:To late now];W[ka];B[ac]C[BH:Far to small, probably meant as a Ko-thread. But it is a
Gote move!];W[ab];B[ad]C[Aside: Even if black would have fought the Ko, there is
nothing to worry for White. say black takes back the Ko at L18
(e.g. after your tenuki), White could play O17 and the 2 black stones
at N17/N18 are lost (Black N19 White O19, no way to get out of the
Atari). Of course your move N19 is 4 points bigger. But if you see
another big move (like K8) on the board, you should do it now]
;W[ma];B[mi];W[mh];B[ni];W[li]C[It was a lot of time that I have seen J8 was a big move but I
didn't found time to play it before. Do You think I had to play it
before? If yes, when?
BH: E.g. instead of N19];B[il];W[im]C[I thougth I was a good idea to let him enter my territory to
take away some of his territory what do you think?
BH: To answer such a question one must count.
The figures of my previous count (without center)  are still ok, with two changes: Playing J8 black has gained about 5
points on the lower edge (probably a little more, but black has lost
territory in the upper right since the last count, so +5 is ok).
White has gained  12 points on the right side (the 4 captured stones +
2 dead stones around F11). White needs less then 10 more points in the
center. So still: J10 gives a clear win. How your move will turn out
is hard to predict. As your oponent seems weaker in fights then you
are, it is likely that you succeed. But against a stronger oponent...  So I would say: J10 is the right move (but of course that is partly a
matter of taste)
To make a clear statement: If you would have played in this position
J10 against me, I am quite certain that I hardly have a winning
chance. After your move J7 I would think I have a very good chance to
win playing black];B[hm];W[jm];B[hk]C[BH:Black should play K8. I do not see a way for you to rescue
your stones];W[lm];B[lj]C[BH:As this move does not work black should not play it.]
;W[mj];B[oi];W[kj];B[ml];W[cr]C[BH:The timing is not good. Black should play M8 now]

;B[es];W[cs];B[fr];W[ii]C[BH:Now you have a clear win in secure territory. I will stop
commenting now except for your questions];B[hf];W[if];B[ke]
;W[je];B[so]C[That was a big move, but I didn't seen it was sente for
him....
BH: It is not really sente. Well it is sente now, as there are no real big
things left. So: One could say this move is blacks right, as it is a
onesided sente situation at a certain stage in the game. Good timing
by black. (note that you could exchange O4 for N5 instead of
answering to T5)];W[rr];B[op];W[np];B[oq];W[pr];B[or];W[mo]
