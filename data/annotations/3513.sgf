C[Bommel:

Hi yip,

I reviewed the opening and the middle game, skipping the endgame... I don't think you played poorly in the middle game, except for some mistakes... I think you were already behind after the opening and regained a fair position in the middle game... see my comments for detailed explanations...


---

yip:
This game ended with White resigning, though really it was one simple mistake at the very end away from a narrow White victory.

I played Black, and felt that I was ahead and in control for most of the game.  I've noticed that I seem to do poorly in the middle game, which often  has something to do with 1) not taking the time to make defensive moves, and 2) playing in the wrong direction.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[de];W[cn];B[dq]C[yip:
The idea behind this move was to allow White to build a wall facing the D15 stone, theoretically making White's resulting influence less useful.

---

Bommel:
the idea behind this move is a good one, but you must ensure, that you end in sente... otherwise W can still make a perfect extension from his wall, denying D15 his main development direction!]
;W[fq]
(;B[fp]C[Bommel:
I have never seen this move before in this situation, but it seems playable... C6 is great support for a fight, so Black may have a difficult time ahead...
 
to stick with your idea building a wall facing D15, I would suggest starting the joseki at D5 instead (see variation)]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[eq];B[dp];W[dl];B[go];W[hp]TR[go]C[Bommel:
is exchange hurts B! W has ignored to play an extension around K3 after D4... this leaves his group weak and open for a B Attack later on... the marked exchange strengthens the white group... I would skip this exchange and defend the cut right away...]
;B[dn];W[co]TR[dn]C[Bommel:
again an exchange that favours white... the cut is still not resolved fully, but white gained on the side... you should have played D5 yourself...]
;B[fl]C[Bommel:
This move leaves some aji behind...];W[kq]C[yip:
This doesn't seem like a good result for Black at all.  I end up playing now where I probably should have just gone in the first place...

---

Bommel:
you are right, the result is terrible for Black... see my previous comments, where you should have played different...

considering you have sente, the game isn't lost yet...]
(;B[jd]C[Bommel:
I don't like this move... I would prefer to make a shimari at D17, inviting a White splitting attack... this ensures some profit in the corner and during a White splitting attack Black can gain further (see variation)...]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[ed];W[gb]
(;B[cc]LB[db:A][fb:B]C[Bommel:
this is a big mistake, leaving you with a bad result... white has 2 cutting points, A and B... You can cut at A to trap White in the corner, or cut at B to take the corner for yourself (see variations)...]
;W[cb];B[dd];W[db];B[bc];W[gd];B[ci]C[Bommel:
Great move, an important keypoint, also aiming at C7 aji... white should have played there instead of G16... here you start to catch up...]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[ei];B[dh];W[fj];B[hc];W[gc];B[fh];W[eh];B[eg]
;W[gj];B[ho]C[Bommel:
too small];W[fg];B[ff];W[gg];B[gf];W[io];B[hg];W[gh];B[bb]C[Bommel:
Wrong direction! You get little in the corner, but drive White towards your right side... I suggest attacking this group from the other side and build something on the right...]
;W[hb];B[ic];W[he];B[hh];W[if]C[Bommel:
Strange white moves, considering the group can live on the side...]
;B[gi]C[Bommel:
Good, finally the D13 aji is resolved...];W[kf];B[hj];W[cj]

;B[di];W[dj];B[bn]C[Bommel:
White is alive on the side, so you can play the C7 tesuji instead of B6... I would consider this side as settled and leave C7 for the endgame...]
;W[cm];B[in]C[Bommel:
Not big enough, white M16 would hurt you terrible! I suggest jumping to M16 or N17...]
;W[jo]C[Bommel:
You are lucky here...];B[ld]C[Bommel:
Important move, white could have attacked here severly!];W[hk]
;B[jn];W[hm];B[hn];W[ko]
(;B[po]C[yip:
This didn't feel right when I played it, but I was get overly concerned about the white territory at the bottom.  Would there be enough time to build up some thickness, then choose a point?

---

Bommel:
attacking this corner seems a good idea, but Q5 only helps White to solidify the corner... I would stick with the standard approach move at P4 (see variation)...]
;W[pp]C[Bommel:
Now the white Q4 corner is solid, your Q5 stone not worth a lot... you lost much with this exchange...]
;B[ib]C[Bommel:
Good, now white must find life in the center... your position is good for attack!]
;W[qf];B[mf]C[Bommel:
Good, R14 seems wrong, punish White!];W[lg];B[mg];W[jh];B[qd]
;W[qj];B[no]C[Bommel:
You should invade at R12 right away, otherwise the N13 push was pointless...

but because of your Q5 mistake earlier, you also have to do something for this part of the board to, a painful situation for Black...

The necessarity of your move at O5 shows, why Q5 was bad in the first place...]
;W[oo]
(;B[op]C[Bommel:
I think this is too aggressive... without a white mistake the resulting bottom Black group shouldn't be able to live... I would stick with an atari at P6, there isn't much more for Black in this position (see variations)...]
;W[on];B[nn];W[np];B[oq]

White made a terrible mistake here, O3 seems the only move to me...]

;B[lo];W[mn];B[ln];W[nm];B[mq];W[kn];B[kp];W[jp];B[jq]C[Bommel:
Good move, this creates some more ko threats for later... playing L7 right away would also do the trick, but White leaves no threats for later...]
;W[jr];B[iq];W[hq];B[km];W[ip];B[lm];W[oe]C[Bommel:
Up to here I consider the game even... the result will be decided in the endgame...

I skipped the endgame, it seems pretty "normal" to me, without big mistakes... My last comment is dealing with your final question at the end of the game...]

yip:
This is where my opponent resigned, but it was only afterwards that I saw the other sequence (in the variation).

Thank you for taking the time to review this game.  I appreciate your comments!]
)
(;B[rn]C[yip:
Assuming that White defended here instead of passing, it would have been a very narrow victory for him.  If black seees this, though, it's not close.  Of course, Black didn't see it until entering the comments for the review, so it's probably moot.:)]

(;W[sq]C[yip:
The "correct" conclusion?  (more comments on  move 261)

Bommel:
I prefer S6 for White here (see variation)...]
(;B[ss];W[rn];B[ls];W[ks];B[or];W[ir];B[pr];W[ls]C[yip:
This gives White a 0.5 point victory.

Bommel:
I think you should focus your studies on the opening... in this game you caught up in the middlegame, but your opening position was worse than the White position...

good luck on your way!!])

There is no way for Black to kill the white stones now...speaking for White I would play simple at S6 instead of T3 to avaid ko threats for Black and further complications... but T3 and S6 would leave the same result...]

you get a nice and solid corner worth 12-15 points in sente... next a splitting attack like O3 or M3 should be considered (I prefer O3)... an extension at the left is also huge for both sides now...

Some players may dislike this result for Black, because   White gets such great influence in the early beginning... I consider it playable for both sides and would play it myself...]
