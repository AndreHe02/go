C[REVIEWER: Pete 4k AGA

PETE: generally White played too timid (c3, k10, f13, o14). White also lost sente few times while he didn't need to do so (o7, n10). 
White managed to regain some momentum during the second half of the game which closed the gap to just few points. 

Black played fairly good solid moves but few mistakes along the way cost black some points. E.g. moves at S14, D12.
White got way too much territory at the bottom (considering black's bottom right corner had 3 stones and white's bottom left corner had only 1) and that white ended up with more territory). Black also allowed white to get too man points in the center-right.]

;B[cj];W[qj]LB[fc:A][nc:B][ql:E][dp:D][nq:C]C[PETE: Black's next move requires some thought on direction. The group at A is perfectly lined up for white to approach at B. White would really like to play at B some time soon. Approach move at C is also good of course but because the lower left corner is still so open, black will have much easier time splitting up the two groups of stones started with C and D.  That's why I think I would prefer for black to play at E next.]
(;B[qh]
(;W[qm]C[PETE: White can also just further if it wants to put more pressure on black.]
;B[qo];W[oj]LB[om:A][np:C][nq:B]C[PETE: I think this is correct. Playing at A only invites black to play at B or C.]
;B[oh];W[nc]LB[nq:A][pr:B][qr:C]C[PETE: This is a good move but I think I would prefer to approach at A first. If black doesn't respond, White has moves like B and C which create a ton of trouble for black. So black probably would respond giving white the opportunity to play in top right.]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]C[Overplay?

PETE: Yes.]

PETE: See variations.]

;B[rd]C[PETE: this is a mistake by black.];W[pe];B[se];W[od]
;B[ic];W[nm]LB[jq:B][nq:A]C[PETE: too small / slow. White should approach at around A or take the middle with B. The two black stones in the corner have weaknesses.]
;B[np]LB[nm:A]C[PETE: Black fixes his weakness and takes more territory. Meanwhile white only got some more security with the move at A.]

(;W[cq];B[en]LB[cl:A]C[PETE: Black expands his framework and secures the point at A.]
(;W[ge]C[PETE: Yes - It is definitely necessary to do something about the center. White could probably be more agressive and push the two black stones up on around some first. See variation.]
;B[le]LB[nf:A]C[PETE: good move.  If black plas at A next, white will be in trouble as the escape route will be cut off.]
(;W[jj]LB[ej:A]C[I wanted to control the middle but this may not be the best way.


PETE: It is going to be very hard to control the center because of the big black moyo on the left. Reduction move at A would be better.]
;B[rc]C[This looks like a big move to me, but is it big enough that I should have given up sente earlier to keep black from moving here first?

PETE: white is OK. It will be able to either form an eye or run to the center. So I don't think move in this area earlier than this is necessary.]

(;W[fg]LB[fh:A][hh:B]C[Feels a little awkward to me

PETE: Yes, think so too. White is trying to stay connected to the top right-corner but the connection is very weak. White might as well play one further and assume it will have to run. See variation.]

C[PETE: this move is huge. Before this move white could have probably played at A to reduce black. Now that chance is gone.]
;W[in]LB[fi:B][qq:A]C[PETE: this move is not very effective. Black is too strong for white to try to kill anything. White is just inviting black to secure his area more.]
;B[il];W[kl]LB[mg:A]C[PETE: White is trying to get some territory in the center. Black can fold this plan by making a threat to the group in the top right (by playing at A).]
