C[EmTom: Hi Thank you for reviewing my game. There will be some questions later in the game but of course add as much comments as you can :)

tf: Hello, I tried to give some comments about your questions and where to find it appropriate. I hope you will find it helpful. Torsten.]

;B[pp];W[qo];B[qr];W[qj]TR[kp]C[tf: The marked white stones seems to close to blacks thickness after the joseki on the right side.]
;B[rr];W[cf];B[di];W[fd]LB[ff:A]C[EmTom: This is more like an experiment for me so please show me some possibilities that i have after d11 pincer and after this move (if its correct).

tf: this seems like one of the most complicated josekis. I'm sorry but I don't know exactly whats best here for white to play. Playing at a is possible as it separates both black stones, but creates also some very complicated variations. So feel free to look at kogo's joseki dictionary to find some good inspirations.]
;B[df];W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[cd];W[jc];B[dg];W[nc]C[tf: After all the exchange seems fair for white. Black on the left looks a little overconcentrated.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[cm]LB[ld:A][ne:B]C[EmTom: I considered A here but i decided to play elsewhere. What do you think?

tf: A seems a little bit slow to me, I want to play there, I would prefer B. But your move is also a big point. It hard to decide whats the best move.]
;B[hp]C[EmTom: Im not sure what to think about this black move

tf: Its an invasion in your moyo! :) You have to attack somehow...]
;W[eq]LB[jn:A][km:B]TR[kp]C[tf: may be this is the wrong side. Your marked stone is also not strong, so you should reinforce it perhaps with A or B. Even if the black lives easily you will secure left corner.]

;B[iq];W[hr];B[lp];W[jr];B[lq];W[kr]C[tf: This sequence was gote for you, and the left-bottom corner is still not save.]
;B[je]LB[id:A]C[EmTom: Im not sure if I answered correctly. What do you think?]

(;W[ld]LB[jd:A][id:B]C[tf: If you want to secure both sides against splitting A seems ok, but black gets even more influence. The black move is very light and hard to handle for white. Playing at B doesn't secure both sides (see variation).]
;B[ck]
(;W[oj]LB[hd:A]C[EmTom: This move should be at A?

tf: Yes, I think so. An black invasion at S8 can be handled easier by white. (See variations at the previous move.)]

;B[kf];W[lg];B[hh];W[nm];B[cp]C[EmTom: Here i totally didnt know what to do. I would like to try to kill it but im not sure whether it is possible or not.

tf: good invasion by black, please see variations, at move 84.]
;W[cq]LB[co:A]C[tf: A seems also possible, this lets black live in gote (or even ko) but connets white stones firmly and makes some influence.]
;B[co]
(;W[dm]C[tf: This move is a little bit slack, as its doesn't put much pressure on the black stones. (see variations)]
;B[bq];W[cr];B[do];W[eo];B[en]LB[dn:A]C[EmTom: So much for killing now im the target.]

(;W[dk]LB[dn:A]C[tf: this is clearly a bad move as its lets escape the black stones to easily. I think A is better.]
;B[fo];W[ep];B[dn];W[cj];B[ci];W[bj];B[bi];W[bl];B[mi]LB[bn:A]
C[EmTom: A mistake? I thought he will play at A

tf: A seems good attacking move for black, but white has space in the center.]
;W[bn]LB[fl:A]C[tf: this is to small I think, A is better, as it reduces also blacks influence.]

;B[bg];W[br]LB[fl:A][lm:B]C[EmTom: This was too small wasnt it... I should have entered the center right?
 
tf: yes in local view its big, but from global point of view A or B seem more urgent.]
;B[mm]LB[ml:A][gn:B][ki:C]C[tf: White could try something A and use the weak points B and C. But this gets very complicated and risky and its out of my scope.]
