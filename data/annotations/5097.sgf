;B[pd]C[Dear killgo2.
I think you played too much in a hurry, and need to play more calm. No attack really worked, because those moves weren't enough prepared. There was some tactics missing too.

A: Although I would have played here as well when being Black, I realize that there are many variations which black could have chosen. I reccomend you to review some josekis from jansteen's webpage for comparison.]
;W[qp]C[A: a difficult and tricky variation.];B[qq]
(;W[po]C[A: I think this is a little strange...];B[oq];W[rq]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[qo]C[I don t know if it was good to play a ko right away...

I suppose there are no ko threats at the beggining, so it's ok to play this way.]
;W[qd];B[qp];W[pc]
(;B[oc];W[qe]C[A: I think because B is strong and thick in the LR corner, B21 was not so effective, W22 seems to me better off against B's thickness (if I see this correct)]
;B[od];W[qb];B[pb];W[qc];B[jc]C[A: I see this as an overextension]
;W[gc];B[cj];W[lc]C[I wanted to attack but I did not get any compensation for the separation of the 2 black groups :-(

A: this seems natural for me.];B[je];W[le];B[of];W[lg]
(;B[jg];W[nb];B[ob];W[oh]CR[li]C[Should I continue to run instead of p12?

A: this is a difficult fighting move . Seems a little bit of an overplay to me without support from the center.]
;B[mf]C[Maybe the connection is best ^^.. but I did not want to play submissive, I wanted to conterattack
;p

A: how?]
(;W[me];B[nh];W[ne];B[pf];W[kf];B[jf]CR[mf]LB[ke:A][kg:B]C[A: W44 helped to produce more weakness in its group. the cut at A and B are possible now.]

;B[ni];W[rf];B[rg];W[re];B[cm];W[fq];B[bp]C[A: this is painful for W]

;W[id];B[jd];W[bq]C[this is the beginning of the end : after this sequence I was desperate and I played worse and worse T.T

The game was already lost I think ^_^
