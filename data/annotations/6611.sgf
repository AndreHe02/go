C[Hello and thankyou for reviewing my game.  I played this at the go club that I started,  but even though I won, I feel that there were alot of mistakes I made and if my opponent was good enogh could exploit them.  I just started playing on the 19*19.  Please help me!!

[CW\] Hi. I will indicate my comments with CW. I thought you played a good game. You had a good sense of the important moves and were able to exploit your opponent's slack moves effectively. You played a few bad shape points that I pointed out in the game but otherwise your game was very solid.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[dh];B[ge]C[I think I jumped out one space too far.

[CW\] Not at all - this is a joseki];W[fc]
(;B[cd]C[Should I have kept jumping out to the center?

[CW\] Not necessarily, but if you want to settle in the corner, attaching at C17 is the standard method. H16 is also a big point here.]
;W[hd];B[he]C[[CW\] pushing from behind like this is usually a bad idea, especially if your opponent's stones are on the 4th line. If white plays J16 here it becomes a hard game for black.]
;W[cc]C[[CW\] Good move from white.];B[cg];W[ch]C[[CW\] This is a painful exchange for black. Your position is very compressed, and you have strengthened white.]
;B[bc];W[bb];B[ac]C[[CW\] This is not usually a good a move. Can you imagine if white plays at B15? If you then connect at B16, white can pull back to B13 and it becomes hard for you. The situation is difficult for you, however, one eye appears to be the best you can do in this situation, so you will have to keep running.]
;W[dl]C[Could my opponent have played a move to reduce my eyespace.

[CW\] Yes - B15];B[pj]C[was this good?  I was thinking of (e,4) too

[CW\] This is ok. E4 is possible, on the theory that approaching corners is bigger than sides. the problem is that white is already quite strong there, so you can imagine fierce resistance, perhaps with some kind of pincer. Personally I like J16 or K16 to try and confine white to the corner.]
;W[eq]C[[CW\] This is arguably a bit small at this point of the game. White would rather have you approach so that you can attack.]
;B[jp]C[I wanted to take the last big points

[CW\] Sure - perfect for black now.];W[hq]C[[CW\] a bit slow from white]
;B[id]C[[CW\] good!];W[hc];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb];W[hb];B[kc]C[[CW\] a great result for black, although the cutting point is a concern.]
;W[mp];B[mo]C[was this good?

[CW\] No - in general, attaching to your opponent's stones just makes them stronger. In certain cases what you're trying (to connect your groups) can work, but typically only on the 3rd line, and then only if hte stones are 3 stones apart, instead of 5.]
;W[no];B[np];W[lp];B[lo];W[ql]C[[CW\] Terrible move from white - absolutely cannot leave the battlefield.]
;B[pl];W[nq];B[op];W[nc]C[[CW\] white's tennuki's seems crazy. To invade where black is super strong is even a worse idea.]
;B[nn]C[Should I have ignored this approach?

[CW\] I think so. Your corner is huge now, and white will battle to settle on the top. However, white can still play K3 to connect, so perhaps L4 is more important.]

(;W[ne]C[[CW\] white can settle by invading at R17.];B[pf];W[pb]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[ld];B[ng]C[was this a good cap?

[CW\] Well, your territory is growing perfectly, so in that sense I can't criticise it. The cutting point at J15 is getting worrying, however.]

(;W[mc]C[[CW\] It is hard to see what this achieves, but its hard to get two eyes here. See variation. Shows that white's invasion was crazy.]

(;B[lf]C[I tried really hard to keep white pinned up in the corner.

[CW\] Nice idea, but doesn't really work. That cutting point will return to hurt you.]
;W[ke]
(;B[kf];W[je];B[ie];W[jf]C[[CW\] Ouch. And now your group on the left is in grave danger.]
;B[gh]C[I don't think this move did anything.

[CW\] I think it was important to make sure your group got out into the middle.]

(;W[me]C[[CW\] Not so great, there are more active ways to get two eyes. See variation.]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[ah]C[[CW\] Not so great. White can play B14 to threaten your eye space, and of course, can play A11 (and A18) in sente as huge endgame points.]
;W[cf];B[df]C[Did I respond correctly?

[CW\] I don't think so. You were lucky that white blundered. See variation.]

(;W[dg]
(;B[bf];W[bg];B[ag]C[[CW\] White should play the ko. It could get very very hard for black. Now hopefully you can see why your descents to the edge (A17 and A12) are so bad.]

(;W[ce];B[be];W[cg];B[dd];W[fg]C[[CW\] Black has been reduced to one eye.]
;B[gg]
(;W[jg]C[[CW\]...again white loses the plot.];B[ff];W[pm]
(;B[om];W[pk];B[ol];W[qk];B[ok]C[Did I play this sequence out well?

[CW\] Not especially. See variation. White can easily live here with S11.]

(;W[ra];B[sb];W[pn]C[[CW\] No good. S11 is the right move here.]
;B[qj]C[Could white have still made life on the right side?

[CW\] I think so. See variations.]
(;W[eg]
(;B[ef]C[[CW\] This is a pass. White cannot separate.];W[oo]
;B[on];W[po];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro]
(;W[qm];B[rn];W[pe];B[qe]
(;W[hg]C[Would ( H, 14 ) be a good answer

[CW\] I don't think it would make any difference.];B[hh];W[hf]
;B[gf]C[I dont think I should have allowed white to make that strong bamboo joint.

[CW\] It depends on the plan. This bamboo joint doesn't actually achieve anything for white. Black needs that 2nd eye, however.]
;W[ji];B[hj];W[ik];B[ij];W[jj];B[kp]C[[CW\] big point. The game is secure now, so long as your group on top left does not die.]
;W[oe];B[of]C[[CW\] This move is tiny. Worth at most one point.]
;W[kk];B[lm]
(;W[hk]C[[CW\] White is driving black into his own territory. Something like F10 would be more natural.]
;B[gj];W[gk];B[ih];W[jh];B[fk];W[fj];B[fi];W[ej];B[fh]C[[CW\] Now black is 100% alive.]
;W[bj]C[[CW\] This move is worth -1 point, in gote. A11 is the obvious move.]
;B[fl]C[[CW\] Gives white an attractive target to attack. This would be a good way to lose the game.]
;W[lh];B[mh];W[li];B[mi];W[mf];B[mg];W[lg];B[lq]
(;W[dn]C[Why did white play THAT move?  Seems unecessary.

[CW\] wrong direction. H6 or thereabouts would be enough to turn the game around.]

By the way, based on my play in this game, what would you say me and my opponent's ranks are.  Please be as honest as possible.  Also what are some good tips you would give me (black) on improving my game.  This was pretty much my first time playing on a 19*19 board, but on a 9*9 I am even with a 1kyu.  Well, sorry for blabbing and thak you very much! :)

[CW\] Perhaps white is around 16k and you are around 11k. But it hard to say - play some games on KGS and you will get a better idea.]
