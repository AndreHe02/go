AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[This game wasnt well played by me.... I lost a lot of groups and feel that overall i screwed up. Please if there are any noticible weak points in my game show me. Thank you.

A:
I'm Andre, I 'll review black's moves. I concentrate more on your questions.]
;W[pf]C[A:
Black has a great advantage on influence, that's why white made this move]
;B[qi]C[Was this the right response?

A:
I think this is the right response as it minimise white's space to move.

But white is on line 4 and might use a joseki to take N16 area later.]
;W[pn]C[A:
White test black's response to decide where to attack.];B[mq]
;W[qp]C[A:
Because black decided to defend N4 area, white decided to take Q9 side  and attack R11 at the same time.]

(;B[po]TR[qo][qq]C[A:
This move strengthen white as it touch another white's stone.

The correct response is R3 to defend or R5 to attack.];W[qo]
;B[qn]C[Was haneing here / crosscutting good?

A:
No good at all as white can capture it easily];W[on];B[pq];W[qq]
;B[rn]TR[qm]C[A:
This is a wrong response, you should extend to R7 to pressure and cut him.]
;W[pr]
(;B[np]C[A:
I don't think that this is a correct response, see variation.]
;W[or];B[nr];W[fp]
(;B[go]C[A:
What's the point in making a move here ? If you want to minimise white's space or to attack F4, H3 is the best spot.]
;W[dq]C[A:
Now white touch D4 to make some area for him to breath and he will succeed.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[do];W[cq];B[fr];W[gq]
(;B[gp]C[A:
Wrong response, should be at H2 so that black can ask for help to his right corner area.]
;W[fq];B[gr];W[er];B[hq]TR[gp][gr]C[A:
Try your best to avoid this shape, this is a bad shape as it can be cut easily and strengthen your opponent's.]
;W[hp];B[iq]C[Was this the best response?

A:
Q14 is the ladder breaker so you can't capture it using a ladder.]
;W[cf];B[ch];W[cc]
(;B[cd]C[should i have played D17 here instead?

A:
See variation!];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[ed];B[fc];W[bd];B[ee]
;W[ce];B[de];W[bc]
(;B[db]C[A:
Too soon!

you should battle for another spot instead of this one];W[cb]
C[A:
This is a false move made by white as it is too small to fight, he should aim for bigger spot.]
;B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[nc];B[ne]C[I felt strange making this move it felt uncomfortable, why?

A:
Perhaps that is because you don't know the continuation of this move. This move is good because you seperate 2 of white's stone, he should have played it around O14-M14.]
;W[ld];B[jd]C[Would M14 have been better?

A:
White is aiming to make a territory on the side, this is the best spot.]
;W[jc]C[A:
His are weak so he touch.];B[lc]C[A:
This move is rather weird as this spot would be captured easily by white.]

(;W[kc]C[A:
Placing the stone at M18 instead of this spot would be more interesting.]

;B[kf];W[kb];B[bq];W[bp];B[cr];W[br];B[bs];W[aq]C[I screwed up in my reading here, but was there a way to have killed that shape?

A:
There is no way of killing it as it is already has an eye and have enough space to make another eye.]
;B[dr];W[es];B[ar];W[bq];B[bo]C[A:
Why do you touch ? the result will be unfavorable to you.];W[eo]
;B[en];W[co];B[bn]C[Was this a mistake?

A:
Yes, it is a mistake. you let white enter your territory, you should have fight for it. But before this, B5 is already a mistake.]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[cm];B[dl];W[dm];B[em];W[cl];B[ck]TR[dl][em]C[A:
Another mistake. Avoid this shape.];W[cp];B[ek];W[dg];B[eg]
;W[dh];B[bl];W[bm]C[i thought i was seeing somethingthat i wasnt...]
;B[al]C[A:
No need to respond this move, use this chance for other spot.]

Actually your mistake starts here, why waste a move for a point, or I should say that you waste a corner for a worthless stone.]

A:
These are my suggestions :
1. Think twice before :
a. touching
b. atari
2. Before making a move, think : "how many would I save by making this move ? any better points to move ?"
3. On a handycap game, white is at huge disadvantage so most of his moves are bluffs and waiting for a mistake or perhaps attracting for a mistake.

Go is about who gets the biggest point so you have to play the biggest points available.]

If White would like to save his F4 stone, he would touch D4 on D5, its a typical joseki. Or perhaps making a move at E6 or E7 is fine too.All of those are joseki,you can find it on any complete joseki books.]
