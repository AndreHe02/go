C[-- Hello, my name is Sven and I´m about 9 kyu at Dragon Go Server and around 13 kyu on KGS. All my comments are preceded by "--", so you can more easily spot them.
If something remains unclear or you have additional questions, do not hesitate to write me! I hope I can help a bit.

-- Basically, the play was well-balanced as concerns your reading abilities and short-distance fights. However, often you are concerned too much about securing territory instead of building influence. Don´t forget the center. What cost you most of your points was the top group being chased along the board.]
;B[pq];W[pd];B[cp];W[cd]LB[qf:B][qo:A][jp:C]C[I used to play A here, but now I am playing B and trying to be more agressive. What is better here, A or B?

-- I think you are right, B is more pressing for White, while A is defensive and aims at an extension around C, which then looks a bit overconcentrated.]
;B[qf];W[qh]LB[nc:C][qc:B][of:A]C[This pinch scares me a bit, I just run out...is it good for black?

-- If Black is strong at the right side, he should jump out at A, puttting the marked white stone under (here only moderate) pressure. Else you should consider jumping into the corner or attacking from the other side, too.]

(;B[of];W[nd];B[rd];W[qc]
(;B[pj]LB[oh:A]C[Is it good? Sometimes I just don't know where play...I try to attack R12, but think its not a good move...

-- The three black stones are weak. I would prefer A.]
(;W[ep]C[-- good idea of White to tenuki here]
(;B[dq]C[-- I´m not sure if this move is joseki... (?) the sequence which is played here lets White easily establish a position on the bottom.]
;W[eq];B[cm];W[iq]
(;B[kq]LB[lp:C][lq:B][mq:A]C[This move seems to far from Q3, but if I play something like A white can make good points in lower side. Any sugestions?

--Difficult to tell. A is not so bad, neither is L3.
What about B or C?]
(;W[io];B[qo]TR[pj][kq][pq]C[This shape sounds good. Am I right?

-- Now you have good positions on the right and the bottom, but the center is open... on the other hand, you have secured some territory...]

(;W[cj];B[fc];W[dc];B[ic]C[-- good, making a position while threatening the white group in the upper right corner]
;W[kc]
(;B[ri]TR[kq]C[Attack and make territory, right?

-- no. White already has abandoned this stone more or less, so he needn´t answer here. Besides, you had better enlarge you influence towards the center and strengthen you weak stone at the bottom.]
;W[pr]C[Here starts a sequence not so good for me...];B[oq]
;W[or]C[mairov [18k\]: oh sorry, hi]
(;B[qr]LB[nq:A][nr:B]C[Isn't A or B better? Becous I can get a nice wall and use it with Q10 and S11. Am I right?.

-- yes, definitely!];W[nq];B[np];W[mp]C[-- I don´t think White can afford to double hane here...]

(;B[nr]LB[mq:A]C[-- wrong, N3 instead];W[mq];B[os];W[mr];B[ps]
;W[mn];B[no];W[mo]
(;B[ko]LB[kn:A]TR[kq]C[Maybe A is better...is it?

-- not much - the marked stones are dead - perhaps there remains some aji for later...]
;W[kn];B[rh]C[-- see the comment to move 25 - White has no business here.]
;W[je];B[fe];W[df]
(;B[pg]LB[mf:A][fg:C][dk:B]C[-- again !?! play at A instead, enlarging you territory, or, even better, B, in order to regain a path to the center and limit White´s expansion on the left. (or C)]
;W[mf];B[nh];W[fg]TR[fc][ic][fe]C[-- watch out for the upper black group!]
;B[en]LB[dk:A]SQ[ek][dl][el]C[-- too timid! you invite White to play around the marked points and enlarge his influence better at A]
