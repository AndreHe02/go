(;B[hl]C[I think this move was not good for connecting or expanding my territory, and perhaps the center would be better?

I don't think this move does much at all.  The connection you're making is loose at best, and the two groups are relatively strong.  Instead, strengthen the lower right, or attack the top left.]

;W[ll];B[lm];W[hc];B[cc]C[Was the 3-3 invasion a bad idea here? It seemed to me the only option to get into that corner

I'd recommend doing a few preliminary attacks from the bottom, because you can't loose the initiative here.  Attacking from the bottom is really important.]

It's a tough situation, the only way to save it that I could find is to go back to right away when he first started invading, and make sure you're strengthening the left side, even if it means sacrificing territory on the right.]

I think you played pretty well.  The first half was fine, but you started slipping up by playing too close to your opponent, and not keeping the initiative.  Losing the shape in the middle was also a huge blow, but that was called by a small mistake.  Things you can do to improve is to practice Yose go problems, in order to learn how to keep your opponent on the run.  You also might want to try counting, even if you're really vague, once or twice a game, to know just how far you need to go, and how big of risks you ought to take.

I hope my comments were helpful, if you have any questions feel free to email me!]
