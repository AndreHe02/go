AB[pd][dp]C[B: hi, I'll try to do the review, for white. My comments start with B.]
;W[pp];B[fq];W[cd];B[nc];W[ec];B[qe];W[dj];B[co]
(;W[cm]C[it was may be more urgent to strengthen the sud east corner.

B: yes, black claims 2 corners, so you have to compensate with big moves. I'd prefer the first variation (R9).]
;B[iq]C[B: black is still going for territory, so you can go for influence, e.g. R9 again.]
;W[lq];B[qi]
(;W[jd]C[B: nothing wrong with, I think.];B[lc];W[jc];B[ql]
;W[qn];B[nn]C[B: here black is trying to get a moyo on the right side. It's possibly better to reduce (around M11), or at least to keep the stones from connecting (R7).]
(;W[np];B[mo];W[om]C[B: close, I'd prefer Q7. As you saw in your game later on, you can be cut off, or lose a portion of the right side.]
;B[ol];W[nm];B[mm];W[ln];B[mp]C[B: if black doesn't respond to your peep, make sure if he is right. See variations.]
(;W[mq];B[mn];W[lo];B[ml]C[B: what was the purpose of P7? If it was to get into his moyo, try to continue that. See variation.]
(;W[lm];B[pm];W[on];B[pn];W[oo];B[qo];W[qp];B[rn];W[ro];B[qm]
(;W[po]C[mistake...

B: it's not a problem to lose some part on the right, if you can get into his moyo, or cut him as a result. See variation.]
;B[rp]
(;W[rq];B[so]
(;W[io]C[the black moyo begin to be quite large but I thought it was important to use my wall to control the sud west corner.
But it was probably possible to play it later.

B: it is true that your wall isn't doing anything. But while you still have the option to play O8, I'd prefer to play that.
And what about M4 instead? Then your wall is connected and you can use your wall later on (maybe not to make territory, but to prevent black from gettting points there).]
;B[lk];W[il];B[jj]C[High time to reduced this moyo!

B: hopefully not too late, O8 is closed now after black played M9, and K10 gets into your moyo, but you are thinking in the right direction with your next move.]
;W[lf]C[B: this is the right direction, but L15 or L14 would be safer. See next comment and variations.]
(;B[nh]C[B: you get what you want now, he defends. He could also try to cut you at L15.]
(;W[mk]LB[ll:A][nl:B]C[misreading: I expected A or B...

C[B: this gets you into black territory which is still open at A and B, so not urgent. C brings a lot of trouble for the black group. D or somewhere near tries to save your stones inside blacks other area, so I'd see if C or D is possible.]

B: agreed.];B[bm]C[black connect...

B: true.];W[gq]LB[kb:A][md:C][be:B]C[B: A is a big endgame move. B defends a big area and tries to make some trouble around B6, and around C tries to get to your stones (see earlier comments). These are worth considering instead of G3.]

(;W[be]C[B: better at B17, as you saw that yourself already.

B: this was my last comment here. You did quite good. As you saw yourself, it is important to see when to invade or reduce your enemies moyo, and to see where the big moves are. I hope to have shown some points in that direction.]
