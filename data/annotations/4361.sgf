Firstly, I would like to thank the reviewer for looking at this.
I know my main weaknesses lie in the opening and in attack and defense.
Saddly, my opponent declined to comment.


My comments start with >>

>> I will give you some ideas in the opening. I think opening is important, whenever i play a good start i'd win.
 
>> Attack and defense is for midgame and difficult, this requires experience by playing lots of game.]

or play black 5 at B or C to prevent white's corner enclosure.

In Pro games, they play A. 

It feels more natural than K16.];W[pj];B[kq];W[qf];B[of]CR[nd]
[nc]LB[qh:A]C[I don't really like this move.  It seems to devote myself to the top, and consequently, I give up too much of the corner.  Unfortunately, I couldn't think of a better alternative.

>> this move is more center oriented.  i don't know if it's good or bad but if white just defend Q12  white has a lot on the side. 


you can play O16 or O17 
There is an invasion point at A later if white doesn't defend.]

[dk][dj][bj][bi][bh][ci][di][dh][ch]LB[cp:A][ck:B][cj:C]C[is this move smaller than making a shimari in the lower right?


Yes I think so. 
Black already has  K16 in front of white's shimari there is no hurry to play there. 

The area around xx points is the remaining open area (bigger) that you should aim for.  

make your own shimari is one idea. 

but if you play A then white might play around B (big point) 
so you might take C10 instead.];W[cp];B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[cn]

>> it's ok i think, the move expands your thickness.  it's the focal point between black and white territory.  

alternatively you could  think of invading right side and attack R14, hoping to turn your top moyo into real territory and damage white's right side..  White R14 looks like the weakest stone.]

Unfotunately, I can never tell if an attack can succede.  I always have too many weak groups to exploit. 

>> what is a sucessful attack?  usually, an attack is not to kill a group.  you attack an opponent's week group to turn your own moyo into secure area or to create thickness, most of the time that group will live but you'll gain more in return.  When you play in mid game you should be flexible and prepare for an exchange. it's difficult to win everything.   Keep your stones connected, separate your opponent and think about eye shape.  

 




 In this case I decided that my only chance to succed was to kill white.  It was impossibly for me to defend the huge moyo I created, so I went for it.  

>> This is a risky strategy.  It seems that you only wait for white to break in.  You should prepare yourself a chance to invade your opponent too.  Try to play a more balanced game, not rely on center territory alone.  
To get a feel in the opening stage, I study the first few moves of Pro games



No matter who I play, it seems I fall behind in the opening and have to resort to risky attacks like in this game.

>>I don't agree. you didn't fall behind in this game.
