AB[dp][pd][pp]C[uhru [15k?\]: hi gg

I played black in this game. I felt I was doing well until the invasion in the lower right, and then everything crumbled. I made mistakes in the fight also because I started running out of time, but mostly I would like to know my mistakes in strategy and direction.
Thanks in advance to the reviewer.

MissDiary:  Hi uhru.  I'll be your reviewer for this game.  I hope you find the information helpful and your questions answered.  I'll also do my best to analysis strategic and directional moves.]
;W[dd]C[starsailor [12k\]: hi gg];B[cf];W[ce]C[MissDiary: It is better to connect than to tenuki. Whenever a stone makes contact with an opposing stone, both stones become stronger. 

In this case, White's stone is making contact with your stone, asking your stone to become stronger by adding another. 

(see variations for more explanation and strategy ideas for applying this concept.)]

(;B[gd]C[MissDiary: This is an interesting move, but makes C14 stone weak and gives White a good shape. It's also very loose as a pincer, since White's shape is already strong and does not threaten White's base nor seal White.]

(;B[hb]C[MissDiary: Hm, looks like you want to attack White K16-N17 base. Otherwise, I don't see H18 doing anything else efficiently.

Might be best to just connect. F14 for Black can become sente later in order for Black to connect or make eyes.
(see variation for connection)
 
Otherwise, if you're aiming to attack K16-N17 group, just go ahead and attack it But white can escape to center or attach to the corner stone.]

(;B[ig]C[MissDiary: This can give White moves to strengthen itself in sente.]
;W[ie];B[hi]C[MissDiary: A center move, not so important at the moment, since in the opening, the direction is from corners towards the side.  We only go into the center if it's absolutely necessary.  

In this case, H11 looks like a pass, because what's important right now is your upper group.  

If you want to tenuki, better moves would be big moves, such as K4 or R14.]

[dn][dm][cm][fp][fq][gq][gp]LB[dd:A][kc:B][cg:C]C[MissDiary: Okay, let's study the board for a minute.  How is white's position?  How are Black's groups?

The A group: White's corner is sealed, but alive.  No potential for more growth, so playing in that area is not big or urgent at the moment.

The B group: White's upper group is fairly secured for the moment.  This means, Black can still attack White, but White is alive, and it may take a couple of moves in order for Black's attack to be sente while White profits elswhere. Since it's settled, it's better to play elsewhere.

The C group: Black's group is connected and alive.  It has influence towards the left side and center. 

Since both sides are settled, we can look for big moves to play.  Because, if we continue to play locally, the opponent can tenuki and play a big move instead, since his groups won't be in any immediate danger, making his moves more efficient.

So what are some big moves? (Possible moves are marked with a triangle)
Q16 is closest to White's influence.  Black hasn't done anything in response to White's soft N17 approach, so Black can make a move in that area.

Q10 seems like a good idea, but the direction is towards the center. There's not much growing Black can do in the center as of yet. Plus, corners and sides are still open, so playing for center is not big. and Black may want some stable territory, so maybe R10?

K3 & K4 are other good locations. Maybe a possible moyo with the C group influence.  They're also nice extensions from both bottom hoshi stones.  

Another idea is to play corner enclosures, like R6, N3, etc.  It tempts White to come in, allowing Black to extend from one direction. 
(see variation for an example of the corner enclosure idea)

So how to choose?  Well, it depends on what it is that you want to go for in terms of strategy, direction, and building your areas.  How would you like the game developed?  What would give you a more favorable result?  Experiment.]

(;B[be]C[MissDiary: A good move, but not very big at the moment since it's not quite sente.
(See variation)]
(;W[jg];B[hh];W[bd];B[pj]C[MissDiary: Nice tenuki.];W[pg];B[nf]
;W[oe];B[od];W[ne];B[pe];W[of]C[MissDiary: Great use of aji!  Using the O14 stone as aji to strengthen your corner.]

(;B[ng]CR[kg][lg][mg][og]TR[nf]C[MissDiary: Maybe, don't save this stone?  It looks like it's going to cost you if you do.  The reasoning is because the marked stone is behind enemy's line (marked with a line of circles). Plus, Q10 is weakened now. One idea is you could threaten to connect with the marked stone to strengthen Q10.
(see variation for an example)

Or, you could tenuki, and then, later in the game, come back to save it when it becomes crucial.

Otherwise, if you try to save it now, and then decide not to save it later, you've already lost quite a bit of stones.  So becareful of your stones when they are in a hostile area - play light.]

;W[pf]C[Strange move, is it necessary?

MissDiary: No. White could lose some points, but it is not urgent or big.  (see variation at Move 98) 

White can choose to ignore and play a bigger move.  Even if you play according to the variation and white lost some stones, what White can gain elsewhere can make up for more than what he lost.]

(;B[kn];W[pi];B[qj];W[qi];B[jp]C[MissDiary: Interesting.  However, if you want to play in this area, you can consider playing 3rd line.  

The reason for 3rd line:
 - to create distance between your stones and your influence so they don't look overconcentrated and to be efficient in covering more grounds
 - it adds some stability when White approaches the bottom. (Because going on 3rd line makes territory easier by stabilizing stones.)]

(;B[jm];W[gl];B[el]C[MissDiary: I can see your stone is trying to prevent White from damaging your area, but the bottom left corner is still very open.

The stone is high and does not balance well with your D4 stone. It seems to be more of an extension for the side points.  This is fine if you're willing to give up corner (or points on bottom) for points on side.
(See variation - White takes corner and still reduce Black)]

(;B[ep];W[dm];B[cn];W[bn];B[cp];W[cm];B[fn]C[MissDiary: It is not necessary for White to connect, since White is alive.  So White could have ignored this move and done some damages to you by taking away your territory.

So, if White's groups are already alive, think about gaining more points elsewhere; don't try to cut White. 

Black can, for example, go to begin solidifying the left side with c9.]

(;B[fi];W[dk];B[di];W[eh];B[dh];W[dl];B[fh];W[ek]CR[be]TR[hk]
C[MissDiary: Let's take a moment and think. Is the marked stone worth more than the points I can gain elsewhere, or is it worth less?

Let's take another stone to compare - say the B15 stone. Which stone do you think is worth more if we save it?

If we save B15, Black has a little more points in terms of territory on the left side. Plus, Black may get A15 as an endgame move, which is definitely going to be worth a couple of points.  What if we don't save B15?

If we don't save B15, White can atari and capture a stone. White may have the endgame move to reduce our left side territory as well.  If we save H9 by moving to G10 for example, all we gained was one point for the eye at G11.  And the area that H9 covers can be considered dame, meaning neutral points, so they're not worth anything.

So in conclusion, B15 has more value than H9 as a single stone, since B15 allows you more possible points than H9 can offer. 

If you want to save a stone, try saving a stone with a higher value.]

C[starsailor [12k\]: thx
uhru [15k\]: thanks

MissDiary: Overall, you played a good game.  There were some nice and interesting moves and you seem to have a developing sense of aji and endgame. But to generalize, here are a few main things you might want to work on:

1- Shapes & hane: Don't be afraid to hane.  Read the cut if it comforts you. Learn to play better shapes by seeing what shapes make better eyeshapes and limits or expands direction. One of many ways to get stronger is to take risks and learn from them.

2- Contact Play: They only strengthened you and your opponent if the stone attaches to a weak stone, so don't be afraid to get stronger. There are more options/strategies to play when your position is stronger.

3- Valuing: Decide whether a stone is worth saving or not by comparing it to another stone/group and weighing the pros and cons.  Plus, after a fight, decide whether you can play big moves.  

To decide if you can play big moves, you can choose to follow these guidelines:
A) Am I weak anywhere? If so, where can I play to strengthen myself?
B) Is the opponent weak anywhere?  If so, how can I attack him while gaining profit?
C) If there are no weak groups, where are the biggest moves?  If there are multiple big moves, where can I play to get the best result for me?

It'll take some time to incorporate these into your play, but they should get you started on gaining more experience and understanding the game better.  They may also help you in developing your own strategies and followups over time.

(;B[dk]TR[ei][ej]C[MissDiary: Connect. Let's take a look at the situation. 

White's two stones are in Black's territory.  Black is strong all around, so Black can connect to rid of its weakness. Net and ladder do not work for White, so Black should have no worries about White's stones, or Black's F10 stone

So, if the opposing stones are in an area you are strong in, look to correct any weaknesses and prevent connection or life if possible.]

(;B[df]
(;W[fc];B[cj]MA[fd][dj]C[MissDiary: This is considered joseki.  F17 can also be played at F16, and C10 can also be played at D10.  It depends on the player's preferences.

Because you have room to make an extension on the side, adding a stone at D14 to become heavy is acceptable.

If you're interested in some ideas on how to use this position, continue reading and browsing through the variations for this sequence.

It is possible that White may choose F17 instead, because it helps protect the corner better than F16.  However, the corner still has aji. Plus, black's Q16 stone is high. White may want to approach it in the near future without having to go back to his corner group in order to stablize it.

Black has his stone low.  The idea is to balance the relationship between the high stones - D4 and D14.  If the stones alternate between 3rd and 4th line, it's more difficult for the opponent to invade.  

Black can look forward to playing Q10, beginning to create some nice influence towards the center in relationship to it's opposite side, amd making a possible moyo depending on how the game develops.

(;W[gc];B[hd];W[ff];B[lc]C[MissDiary: If White plays this way, this is good for Black. Black gets to attacked both White's group and O17 stone in sente.  Black's upper group also has a base now, and can get more secure depending on what White will do next.  

This is one strategy - to prevent connection for a possible attack on a weak group.]
)
(;W[ge]LB[kc:A][lc:B][fb:C]C[MissDiary: If White goes into the center, Black has a some options, a few of them listed.

A: is a double purpose move.  It acts to pincer O17 and create a base for H17 stone.  Even though it creates a base, it is vulnerable for attack.

B: is similar to A, except for a few differences.  B pincers the O17 more extremely, but leaves K17 open for White to invade, that is if White wants to complicate the game, depending on the rest of the board.

C is a low move...(see more at variation)];B[fb]TR[kc][lc]C[MissDiary: ...This attacks White's base. If White protects corner, Black can still go back and pincer the O17 stone at either the triangled spots.  That would be a dream for Black.  

The danger of playing low:
 - White can strengthen the O17 stone by making a base (i.e. L17), forcing black to jump into the center or continuing playing on 2nd/3rd lines
 - In exchange for the few points Black gets, White gains influence. Is it worth it? Is the exchange profitable?]
;W[kc]C[This would create a base for White O17 and White's upper left group can switch for influence if it should loses the corner.]

(See variation as to why protecting the cut may not be a good idea)

The strategy behind this is to separate White. Make White weak so you can attack it and profit, or strengthen yourself. This strategy allows miai.  There's always miai, but you have to recognize them.

1\]  In this case, by attacking O17, you can strengthen your upper group while creating some influence towards the center, allowing you more center control.

If White protects that weak spot, Black can take a bit of the corner away with 3-3, and White is weak.

So the Xs are miai for Black. But do be careful with the "H" group, because it does not have a base, it''s not connected to any other black groups, and it's heavy.]
