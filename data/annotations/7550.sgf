C[Hello for whoever's reviewing this. ^^

Thanks already for making the effort for reviewing this. This is a game I almost lost(I won with half a point O_O;) but I think i made a lot of mistakes here.

I put some questions here, but any comment is welcome!

Hi, my name is Tim Kington, and I'll be reviewing your game today :)
You can reach me at timkington@gmail.com if you have any questions.]
;B[pp]C[AkEr [9k\]: hi gg
Marking [10k\]: hi ^^
Marking [10k\]: gg];W[dd];B[dq];W[qd];B[cm]C[This is a weird mixture of a corner encloser and an extension. This is just meant for rapid development. :P

[Tim\] I don't think this works too well.  If it was one point shorter it would be pretty common.]
;W[do];B[co];W[dp];B[cp];W[eq];B[dr];W[er];B[hp]C[My opponent got me good here, was there a better way to reply this?

[Tim\] I'm not sure what you mean.  This is fantastic for Black.  You got solid territory and now you can build more while attacking White's weak group.]
;W[gp]
(;B[kp]C[[Tim\] You're in a fight over there, so you shouldn't really play away from it yet.  You want to extend either up or down.]
;W[ho];B[hq];W[gq];B[qm]C[[Tim\] So let's look at what happened with White's moves on the left.  You got about 15 points in the corner, and you staked out about 45 in the lower right.  You aren't expecting to keep all of that, but if you get half, it's another 20 points.  Meanwhile, White created a group that will be worth ten at best.]
;W[no];B[np];W[oo]C[[Tim\] Again White is giving you exactly what you want here.  The fourth line is called the golden line.  If you have a wall on the fourth line, and the opponent has a wall on the third, your outside strength is worth more than their territory.  If you have a wall on the fourth line, and the opponent has a wall on the fifth, then your territory is worth more than their outside.  White's trying to give you all of the territory you had staked out, so you should just connect and take it.]

(;B[lp]C[[Tim\] I'm not sure what this move is trying to accomplish.  White can't be cut above, and this doesn't help with your eye space.  How about moving out into the center?]
;W[ko];B[jo];W[ip]
(;B[iq];W[io];B[jp];W[jn];B[mr];W[lq]C[I had no idea it would end up like this, any comment on here?]
;B[jr]C[

[Tim\] Well, at this point you're out of luck.  The best you can do is leave earlier to give White fewer prisoners.]

(;B[ef]C[[Tim\] I think you would be better off keeping what you have here.]

(;W[gd];B[he];W[bj];B[bk];W[ci];B[cj];W[bi];B[ei];W[hk];B[hd]
;W[hc]C[[Tim\] At this point, you have about twenty in the lower right corner, twenty-five in the lower left, maybe ten in the upper left center.  White has about sixty-five at the top and around twenty-five at the bottom, so you have some work to do.  You need to pick up around fifty points on the right and in the left center.]
;B[lj]C[Could I have here put it further away, or was it already to far, or was it not the best option?

[Tim\]  This is the right idea.  I would play a little lower since you have such a strong wall above.]

[Tim\]  The big problems in this game came at the beginning.  Black had a great position at the bottom, but didn't defend it and wound up letting White take it all away.  The attack in the center saved you in the end.  The only consistent mistake I see here is making small moves.  Try to get into the habit of saying to yourself after each of the opponent's moves "Can I ignore this?  Where's the biggest move?"  If you do that, you'll find you get to ignore a LOT of moves, and each time you do it you'll pick up at least five points.]
