AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[ggm: This is my first time sending in a game for review through the Go Teaching Ladder.  I chose this game because I feel I played well, using what I do know and playing my best, my opponent also played well, and I won by only 2.5 points, so I earned it.  This felt like a good representation of where I am at, and what to look at for improvement.  I had been fluctuating between 20k - 17k for about a month.  I have now been 17k, then 16k, and now 15k for about a month, so while I am slowly making constant improvement, I feel I am stagnating in the sence that I have no idea anymore what I can do to improve or where my weaknesses are that are holding me back.  I have commented about a few areas that I have mostly technical questions about, but I admittidly did not know what to ask, so specific and more general advice would both do me some good. Thank you in advance for your time..

K- hi, thanks for submitting your game for review. This is how I'll mark my review comments.
So, a 4-stone game and you are black. General strategic advice for black in this game would be to emphasise joining up your stones and forcing white to attack in situations where you can use your defending moves to build territory elsewhere on the board]
;W[nc];B[pg]TR[pf][qf]C[K- the 2-space jump is unusual, the more common responses marked by triangles]
;W[fc]C[K- standard strategy for white, to open along one side to build a large base to work from]
;B[hc]C[ggm:  This was a little strange for me.  I usualy would play at C13 or more often C14.  I was feeling agressive and went for the pincer.

K- this move is good, disrupts white's plans];W[fe];B[lc]C[ggm: I felt this was good.  Two pincers and enough space in the middle for a base.  What do you think?

K- the instinct is good - attacking and strengthening your stones at the same time]
;W[ne];B[me]TR[pd][pg]C[K- playing a contact move will usually encourage your opponent to strengthen his stones; in this case this is not something you want because of the thin 2-space jump between the 2-space stones]
;W[df]C[K- ...but you got away with it :)];B[cf];W[dh];B[hf]
C[K- again, 2-space jump when close to stronger stones creates a vulnerable shape. Fine if you're planning a sacrifice, otherwise risky]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[ck];B[jp];W[qn];B[ql]LB[nq:A]TR[jp][fq]C[K- after playing the triangle stones (good moves), you should play this stone at A because the benefit you will get on the bottom edge is bigger than preventing white extend along the right side]
;W[on];B[ol]C[K- wow, he gave you a second chance to claim the bottom edge!]
;W[np];B[nq];W[rp];B[ng]C[K- if you *can* kill these white stones, then the right side plus top right corner will be huge, but it's a gamble]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[rl];B[rk];W[qm];B[rm]LB[pl:A]TR[ql]C[ggm: I am not sure why he did not defend his stone at S8.  Could there be a reason? Or was it just a mistake?

K- he's probably aiming to push through at A by putting the triangle stone in atari]
;W[pl]C[K- :)];B[qk];W[rn];B[sl];W[pk]
(;B[nj];W[ok];B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[mn];B[mp]C[K- good, you played back in this area before white did]
;W[mo];B[lq]LB[lp:A]C[K- extending to A would be strong];W[lp]
;B[mq];W[ko];B[kp];W[kn];B[kl];W[hh];B[jh];W[ig];B[lh]LB[hf:C]
[jh:A][nj:B]C[ggm: I feel afterward that this move was a mistake.  I think I should have moved at K14 instead. And my opponent moved there next.

K- the move you played connects A to B, whereas K14 would connect A to C... they look about the same to me]
;W[jf];B[je];W[ij];B[en];W[im];B[hn];W[fl]C[K- yes, good move by white - you missed your chance to play here with the previous move]
;B[ob]C[K- good! I've been waiting for *someone* to play around here :)]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[nf]LB[rg:A]C[K- should be at A]
;W[qg];B[qh];W[rg];B[rh];W[pf];B[pe];W[ph];B[og]C[ggm: Rather than capture by playing P14, I felt this was more solid.  The stone is still dead anyway.

K- yes];W[pi];B[qi];W[qj];B[rj];W[oi];B[ni];W[sh];B[pj];W[oj]
(;B[si]C[K- see variation for "throw in" tesuji];W[sg];B[qj]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[cr];W[br]
(;B[er]LB[dr:A][cs:C][ds:B]C[ggm: I am curious, if I had defended at D2, D1, or C1 instead, is it better?  What is the difference between that and E2 where I played, if there is a difference.  One of those little things that I ponder.

K- I marked those points with A, B, C
A is best, see variations for comments
The move you played gives white the atari at C];W[cc]LB[co:A]
C[ggm: I knew I should have put another stone up there....

K- yes, you left it weak, but instead of defending now you can attack the weak point he's left at A]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[bh];W[bi];B[ch];W[ci];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd];W[ed]
;B[de];W[ee]C[ggm: I have no idea if I played the best moves I could in the next 17 moves.  It got chaotic and I was just trying whatever I thought might work.  Was there something more solid I should have done, or did I handle it well?]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[ef];W[ff];B[eh];W[df];B[di];W[dj];B[ef];W[fg]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[fj];W[fh];B[fi];W[gk];B[lo]TR[fe][ff][fg][fh]
C[K- that sequence of 17 moves you mentioned worked well; you got a live group, took away a chunk of his territory, made him use lots of stones to little effect (triangles), and ended in sente :))]
;W[ln];B[op];W[qp];B[no];W[nn];B[oo];W[po];B[lj];W[gi];B[hg]
;W[ih];B[ei]LB[dh:A][gj:B][fk:C]TR[fi][ej][fj]C[ggm: I was getting paranoid here, as I realized that It would take 2 moves to make this shape safe.  Is there a name for this situation?

K- the point you've played in, and also at A, are "false eyes" or "half eyes", and the stones marked with triangles make an "empty triangle" (before your move juist played, that is), but no other particular names

You're not being paranoid but you could have waited for him to play 1 more move at either B or C before you started to fill in these connecting points]
;W[gj];B[if];W[jg];B[kh];W[ji];B[jj];W[jk];B[kj];W[kk];B[ki]
;W[jl];B[lk];W[km];B[ii];W[hi];B[ll];W[ke];B[kd];W[ie];B[id]
;W[jd];B[jc]TR[hf][if][hg]C[ggm: I think this was monumentaly stupid on my part.  I should have played at H15.  It would have saved my three stones, and I would still probably been able to protect at K17.

K- you're right about the moves, but "monumentally stupid" is a bit harsh! you just missed it; it happens to all of us]

[fs][gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns];B[tt]C[K- you played well. I've got no overall comments about "your whole strategy is wrong, you need to think totally differently" - just the small points I made move-by-move

You could have done better on the right side by not letting him creep into the territory you were building, but to balance that you did well in the top left corner, from a local position of strong disadvantage you got life and took away his territory in sente

Hope these comments are vaguely useful; drop me an email if you want me to clarify anything!]
)
(;B[dr]C[K- rock solid, no atari's possible by white, and he has no sente moves that make his corner stronger]
)
(;B[ds]LB[er:A]C[K- not particularly weak but it gives him a ko threat at A]
)
(;B[cs]C[K- gives him the sente sequence as shown, which makes his corner stronger]
