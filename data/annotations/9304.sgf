C[Hello.

You won this game at O14 (you will see).

Advices :

- finish corners
- be aware of your groups
- Don't make too many weak groups.

And CUT, CUT, CUT.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq];W[en]C[[PD\] Here I wanted to strengthen my hold onthe lower left corner + increase influence on left side of the board + offer a "hook" for further attacks on her bottom right corner

If you want to strengh you left corner, better to play the D6 tobi (or keima C6).
The D6 increase the influence (and will be a "hook" for attack).

You opponent will see your intention playing E6 and xill protect by an extension).

Your play don't protect the cormer at all (see variation)]
(;B[ip]C[Like I said (lol)];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf]
(;W[pb]C[It's not joseki (joseki at L16 - var)];B[qc]
(;W[gc]C[[PD\] Pressing M17

If you want to press, so press. You played a pincer here. (see var)]
;B[cf];W[ch]C[[PD\] Pressing C14 + strengthening lower left

You have to enforce the lower left corner, and black can stabilise in J17, the E6 move was an error.]

(;B[ef];W[ge]C[[PD\] Strengthening corner + pressing E14 + threatening M17

OK for me. but black should now play D11 to stabilize thes two C14-E14 stones. M17 will fly treathing your O15 stones (var)]

(;B[bd]C[Bad move.]
(;W[fg]C[[PD\] This looked more valuable than C17, but it feels like a desperate move.

What would you have done here?

Better to enter at R12 (weak point for black and a good installation. (var)]

Yes. At L16 or O13 (and shutting down black before kill)];W[ng]

(;W[kd]C[[PD\] Want to squeeze M17 and expand my territory

You strenghtened black with this kikashi. Your white group will be in trouble. You not expand your territory because black can enter at k18. Dan't make points with your wall. Push the black on it. (var)]
