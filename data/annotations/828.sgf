The review was requested by Jared Roach,
who plays white in this game.

The commentary is by Jan van der Steen.];B[cd];W[pp];B[pc];W[dp]
;B[jp]LB[jq:A][gq:B][mq:C]C[When entering the opponents sphere usually one would
play lower at "A" making it easier to settle this stone with
one other move at either "B" or "C" but the text move
is also fine. It's also a matter of taste.];W[fc];B[qe]LB[ic:A]
[cc:B]C[Jared: White 8 at "A" seems very slow. On the other hand, settling
the position with "B" seems premature. In short, I do not know where
to play here.

I agree with you: "A" seems slow. However, "B" is playable, see diagram.]

(;W[ic];B[cj];W[qj];B[cn];W[fq];B[qh]LB[cb:A][qm:B][dg:C][dc:D]
[mp:E][nq:F]C[Jared: Clearly, white 14 is too small. Second line move.
"B" seems slow. Maybe something like "C" is the right balance?

White "A" has the flavor of an endgame move since you play from
the direction of a strong group (the two stones at the top).

White "B" makes sense since black threatens to invade the right
side with his last move.

White "C" seems in a bad position once black takes the corner
territory with "D".

Another natural move would be white "E" to prevent that black
k4 creates a base with "F". White "E" would also help in a fight
when black would invade the right side around "B".]
(;W[cb];B[qn];W[qo]C[Usually a good move when black cannot extend the natural distance
but in the cases that you have a weak group/stone along the right
side this exchange actually weakens your own stones so better avoid
it in these cases.];B[pn];W[np];B[nn]TR[pn][qo]C[Another disadvantage of the marked exchange:
black is faster in the center.];W[ql]LB[oj:A][nj:B]C[White has fallen behind in the fight to be ahead in the center.
This move takes away black's base but black is already out
so this move should jump in the center with either "A" or "B".]
;B[oq];W[op];B[gp]C[Jared: I thought about ignoring 23 to play on the right side.
I do not know which is bigger.];W[fp]LB[lo:A][cl:B]TR[gp]C[Answering black's marked move is big. Your move sets up
later the "A" and "B" attacking moves.];B[nl];W[rn]LB[nj:A]
TR[pn][qo]C[This move weakens your own stones again (compare with
the earlier marked exchange). White should jump to "A"
immediately.];B[rm];W[ro]LB[qm:A]C[Jared: Kibitzer consensus in that black 29 should be at "A".

Definitely. I agree.];B[rl];W[qm];B[rk];W[qk];B[rj];W[qi];B[ri]
;W[ph];B[qg];W[nj]C[Now anyway you got this jump into the center.
The difference with the immediate jump at move 26
is that black's upper-right corner and side is much stronger
now, consequently making white weaker in the center since
there are less kikashi moves against black's positions.];B[mj]
LB[mi:A][mk:B]C[Jared: Shape seems to dictate that white 40 be at "A".

Yes, "A" or "B" are the natural moves.]
(;W[nk]C[This move usually is vulgair since you walk with your
head against an enemy stone. If it works it's fine though.]
;B[mk]C[Jared: To justify white 40, I have to play 42.];W[ml]
C[Jared: black 43 caught me off guard.];B[ol];W[ni];B[ll]LB[mo:A]
[ln:B]C[This is a bad move if black cannot capture the white stone.
Normal moves here are "A" or "B", both these moves strengthen
the weakest group in the cross-cut situation.];W[mm]LB[lo:A]
C[Jared: If black plays 47 at "A" I think white is in trouble.

Black "A" is nice shape but it seems white can escape as illustrated
in the second variation.]
(;B[mn];W[lm];B[kl];W[km];B[jl];W[jm];B[lo];W[il]LB[kj:A][li:B]
C[This moves helps black to make shape. Presonally, I would just play
nobi so white can still aim at the moves "A", or "B".];B[kj]
;W[im];B[go]
(;W[lp]LB[en:A]C[The natural move seems to prevent that white's corner gets
closed in with "A", see variation.];B[kp]LB[ko:A]C[Black should just pull with "A", the text move helps
white to make good shape at the bottom while black
is still left with the cutting point at "A".];W[lq];B[jo];W[fm]
C[The misadvantage of this move is that it doesn't affect
the left side much. Therefor I would prefer "A" as discussed
earlier. But anyway, the direction of play is good. A stone
around this point looks majestic.];B[kr]
(;W[mo]LB[jn:A]C[No need to play this move while it removes white "A" in sente
(threatening ko as shown in the variation) so it's aji-keshi.]
;B[ln];W[lr];B[en]C[Positive attitude: attack is best defense.]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr];W[fr];B[iq];W[gm]
(;B[cp]LB[bp:A][cq:B]C[Keima at "A" or invade at "B" seems better.
One diagram to illustrate what might happen
after black "B".];W[do];B[dn];W[co];B[bn];W[bo];B[cq]C[Jared: I debated playing 84 at "b," as the corner seems to be
headed for a seki. But I wasn't positive, and felt I was ahead,
so played safely at "a."]
(;W[cr];B[jr]LB[ej:A][lh:B]C[Jared: Kibitzers felt that a move around "B" was more urgent
for white 86 ("A")

The question here is: white of white's two groups is weakest. The
answer to that question will determine the direction of play.
Let's try one variation....]
(;W[ej]LB[lh:A]C[The disadvantage of this move is that it doesn't affect
black's position a lot so it gives time for black to play "A".
Maybe locally you should have tried something as shown
in the diagram (to give you ideas how to gain tempo in
such fighting positions)...];B[ek];W[fk];B[dk]C[Bad exchange for black.]
;W[lh]C[Good!];B[kh]
(;W[li]C[The normal movement is shown in the diagram.];B[ij]

(;W[fi]LB[gj:A]C[Slow move and besides gives black a useful kikashi at "A".
Please see the variation for a faster way to play here.];B[kg]
;W[mf];B[gj];W[fj];B[gh]LB[eg:A][ci:B][fg:C]C[Jared: White 100 should be at "B," not "A?"

First about black's last move: black should aim "C"
in this position. This move is too defensive.

Your move in the gam ("A") is fine, it goes ahead
of black and weakens his left side.]

LB[ho:A][el:B][gk:C][gc:D]C[Jared: I was not sure if the marked white group had
two eyes if I played 112 at "D."

available.];W[dd];B[gc];W[le];B[kd];W[nc];B[lc];W[pg];B[cc]

(;W[qc]C[Normal would be to play another kikashi as in the diagram
and next to connect your stones.];B[rc];W[pd];B[qd];W[od];B[ne]
LB[of:A]C[Jared: White 144 has to be at "A."

Agree.];W[pf];B[nf];W[of]LB[ng:A]C[Jared: White seems dead if black 147 is at "A."

You still have some resources if black plays "A",
see variations.]
