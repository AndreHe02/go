C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking into my game. I was black and lost pretty badly, although I took a lot longer to resign that I normally would, because I was hoping there was some aji I could use. In this game my opponent built a huge moyo and I failed to reduce it. Also there was a sequence where I tried to kill my opponent without realizing that it wasn't possible to do so. Appart from the many tactical mistakes based on wrong reading, please try to point out the basic shapes and ideas that should lead to correct moves, while avoiding long and difficult tactical variations based on reading. Please comment on my thoughts, which lead to the moves I played, since those are what needs to be corrected or approved. Hope you enjoy the game, it's been one of my more interesting ones, and I'm very much looking forward to your advice.

--

Been a while since last review, hope you will find it insightful.

I don’t give full paths from many things, but more like state my opinion. You should try to figure out how things should go (i.e. do the work to read the situation out). If you don’t get something or disagree with me, please send me a question.]

[dh:G][ci:F][di:H]C[I've had many games that started like this. However I'm really uncomfortable with the high pincer, that white chose. In fact I've never won a game with that move played against me before.

--

There is not that much sense in focusing in joseki (there is a saying that joseki are there for purpose of forgetting them, meaning there is little point on blindly following joseki). Personally, I find fuseki in general interesting, so I’ll try to give my comments here.

That said, d15 is here really common approach, there is some common responses, like A and B. Pincers are often played too, from most common (C) to rarest (H or F), by my experience.

If you don’t know what to do, take simpler variation. A is something that is really, really often played in professional games too, and keeps things simple.]
;W[dh]C[--

That said, if opponent will pincer you, there is likely to be a battle at least on some kind of level. See variation for simpler choice.]

(;B[gd]C[I try to play joseki, but I don't really understand the moves, and even so there seem many viable alternatives almost every move. I think we both messed up this joseki in this game. The scary part was when I eventually figured out my opponents plan, which was the opposite of the strategy I usually play against (taking the corners, crawling around the edge and trying to live/reduce everywhere).

--

Playing joseki out from memory may be ok, but if you’re not sure you remember it correctly, or, more importantly, are happy from the end result, I don’t think you should be playing that certain joseki. By definition, you should only play moves you *think* you will gain from; by playing something ”that may benefit me if I’m lucky” is essentially same from taking a dice and using that to decide the next move. Sometimes, in surprising places, tenuki is highly effective move.]
;W[ee];B[ef]C[I will include a few variations as questions as to how to respond to certain deviations.]

(;W[fe];B[dd]
(;W[ec]LB[fc:A]C[--

This move is wrong. It should be at A. See variation.]
(;B[cc];W[gc]LB[cb:C][fc:A][hc:D][bd:B][ff:E]C[I believe this is one of the less common moves. However I didn't know what to do. Actually, does white have the option of depriving black of a base in this joseki, even if black is prepared to give white nice outside thickness if he can only take the corner?

--

I guess this goes to hard reading. Tsumegos are best way to teach how to deal with situations like this.

In joseki, white G17 would be at A. Then black would play B, or C if black has the ladder.

White’s shape kind of feels thin, so there may be some kind of punishing variation for black, though that would require reading it from start to end (as if it fails, white would gain tons of points). Continuing as per joseki would be okay, I think black will gain a bit with that too.

If white was strong on upper right corner, black may want to prevent whit moyo from taking shape there, by D or other move there. A move at E may make sense too, if you can read it to work.]
;B[cb]C[This move is probably wrong. Defending the D14 cut is more important? Maybe black should cut right now.

-- 

Normally this move requires ladder; see variation. The sequence is quite long, but if you manage to play it few times (or mess up somewhere and investigate later why the move is wrong) or play with it with goban enough, it should be fairly intuitive :)]

(;W[eg]C[Instead he plays this move which, granted, does connect his group and seal me in. I defend the cut rather than pushing up and getting cut.

--

E13 may be scary move, but I do not think it’s good one.]
;B[cf]LB[df:A][cg:B]C[if you want to save E14, just connectly solidly at A. If you want live larger on the corner (and reducting the side), play something like B instead. This move does neither task well.]
;W[ff]LB[mc:B][nc:A][qn:D][nq:C]C[I have the corner, white has quite impressive center influence. Influence like that is very hard to use for players at this level, however it seems to have been my opponents strong suit. In any case, in this position I tenuki. and approach the lower left corner from my side intending to maybe build the bottom, if white wants to take the left side. However I probably should play on the top, something like L16?

--

I like territory, so I wouldn’t be afraid of white’s influence still. Both Q16 and Q4 are high stones, G16 provides some aji and black got quite a bit of territory where white has practically none so far.

L16 would be tenuki still, it does not affect upper right position in any way, as G16’s aji does not work directly. I wouldn’t say L16 to be mistake either, I might as well just play it to mock white’s influence. I wouldn’t say that kind of reasoning for a move would be good, though. Better play something you see to be valuable (If it is to reduce white’s influence, that move would be good. Here something like A and B, or even C or D, may do that job).]
;B[fq]C[--

This is territorial move, saying, white’s influence is nothing you are scared of, and saying you want more territory and white should go to play with her tiny influence.

There is no moyo yet, the left side is too open to be called a moyo.]
;W[hq]LB[fo:A]C[I didn't think this would end up so nicely for white. Maybe I shouldn't take the corner here?

--

I would most likely take the corner. A would be feasible, if you think you seriously need to reduce white’s influence.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep]C[Maybe I should play one of the fancier variations here? Like b3 or f4? I include a variations of the f4 joseki, that's never played by good players, however I can't figure out why.

--

I’ve never played vars starting from B3. F4 mainly when I think the opponent will mess up with it and the messup will cause something good from me. Sometimes even that is not good.

F4 is played professionally too, but the main difference is that it leaves a bit more aji. The main var does contain some aji too, so I see little point in it in standard situation.]

(;B[fr];W[go]C[Now I probably prematurely decide to invade/reduce white's left side. Not sure if I should still play something on the top. How does one decide between that high move in the area, that I want to play and a soft reduction move taking points at the same time, like O17 or N17?

--

I don’t think either O17 or N17 would be bad. It’s more about your playing style.]
;B[cj]C[This is probably not the right move to reduce. I didn't dare make a two space base in the area, so this move is an overplay.

-- 

I think this is fine, though I would most likely just B12 now or tenuki. Moyos are not territory, so making small reductions all the time is supposed to be beneficial for the player who is making the reductions.]
;W[ci]C[however this is unexpected. Nevertheless I don't extend up, since that's what white wants: to make me heavy. I jump out very lightly, which might be the best way to continue after the bad idea to play c10.

--

C11 is practically mistake. Extending would be enough, white has too much aji there.]

(;B[fj];W[dj]C[Now I decide to play some premature sente endgame against the left side, since I was quite sure white would respond after the c10 stones is in place. Maybe white shouldn't respond to everything though? And maybe those moves take away possibilities to reduce more severely later in the game?

--

Well, black is essentially helping white to convert the moyo to territory. So white is more or less doomed to answer all these moves, in a way or not. Since this moyo is everything white has at the moment.

As a move, D10 is not exactly good, as black can just abuse it to make the group live (or escape comfortably), meaning white just converted moyo to territory, instead of attacking black, which is what moyos are supposed to be used.]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[nq]C[White tenukis, which slightly surprised me. I'm not exactly sure how much aji is left at b5, but I guess tenuki is a good idea for white here. Not sure what to do to prevent white from building half the board here, which is clearly his intention.

-- 

For 10k, this tenuki is surprising, but it’s only way to make anything out from that influence.]
;B[qn];W[no]C[Even more scary. The next move, I'm not even sure why I played it. Seen it many times, guess it fixes the corner a little bit. Not sure how much it makes white stronger though, making it harder to reduce him.

-- 

when playing fun-games, I could just O7 or something here, to mock white to convert the moyo to territory. I don’t care to give 30 points to white, if I get 50 points in exchange. Notice all aji black still has.

In real game, black should just ignore and play something sane, like, eh, G7? That’s where white’s moyo is, and after that move, black is kinda stronger than white there...]
;B[oq]C[This move actually leaves the corner open, so if you want to protect the corner, Q3 or Q2 is better. Both also leaves quite good endgame, if white tenukis, and possibility for invasion, which would make white’s moyo useless again... :P]
;W[nr];B[pj]C[I play this to be closer to the center in case white decides to just let me have the entire side and kill f10, which isn't looking good.

--

Screw F10, it has no value by itself. And white can’t kill it with only one move. The most effective way to kill it would actually be to attack your side, so you need to protect it, and then it could be so encircled that it’s dead by default, without adding a single move, resuling white to gain something like... 100 points?

So for you too, don’t try to convert moyos to territory. Q10 says you have moyo on the side, and you’re supposed to use it to attack white, not other way around.]

(;W[nc]LB[nd:A][pf:B]C[This is pretty big. I should have played there earlier, making white's center thickness less effective. Now I decide that I can'T afford to play just on the right side and have to accept a fight.

--

The ”crude” move, A, would be good here. B would be fairly normal here, to further build black’s moyo.]

(;B[kd]C[Might not be the best idea though. White is a player who doesn't like corners, so he just tries to kill me straight up.

--

If you can read the vars arising from this, just play it. I think it’s far too complex. Now white O15 has more sense, as now there is two stones instead of one to kill (meaning, if the stone dies without purpose, it was essentially just a pass, with black gaining nothing from the stone. How humiliating that would be?)]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[hc]C[This seems pretty slow though.

--

This time white decided to pass :P];B[kf]LB[ng:A]C[A would be good too, to let white to take the single stone out (to convert the damn moyo to (small) territory) :P]
;W[ng];B[qh]C[This move is probably a mistake. It's greedy but overestimates how many points I can make on the right side, at the same time underestimates in how much trouble L16 will be, since that group basically has to live in the center now.

--

R12 is totally ungreedy, it’s really really passive move. Normal passive move people plays here is Q12.

Something like O11 would be greedy move, if you play it with purpose of trying to kill the white stones.]
;W[kh]C[Good attacking move by white.];B[ie]C[This might not be good enaugh.

--

Maybe yes, but this is something that’s purely reading. in general J15 is good shape for living.

If there is some peeps you can use to live, you can use them to get better shape. In this position they are not good, as they would lose points. So this is far better.

The question if this is enough is ultimately something else; not everything can be saved and then the poor soldiers must just be sacrificed in the best way possible.]
;W[ig]C[I wouln't have played this if I were white. Rather try to seal from the other side, defend the large knight or the peeps on the right side.]
;B[mf]C[which I take now, intending to either make eyes or counterattack white.]
;W[nf];B[lh];W[lg]C[Is this good? Might be an overplay, leaving too many weaknesses for white. I don't think he can possibly kill me, so he should try to secure his right stick and get a strong wall in the center, which should leave him with a big lead.

--

May or may not be good. You need to read the variations yourself, and you’d need to show a variation you want to know if it is good. There is zillion different variations here that could be used. First you’d need to define what is the goal, what you want to achieve and so on, I could write a book just for covering all different aspects from this kind of attacking, so I won’t be writing it here :-) The general guideline is, first decide what you want to happen, then try to figure out how it’s supposed to happen.

And for killing, well, black’s stones are really weak, and there is not much aji to use.]
;B[kg];W[mg];B[jh];W[ki];B[ih]C[Trying to delay fixing the cut. I was thinking about not fixing at all and trying to counterattack right away but white has quite a lot of liberties...

--

Yes it’s good.];W[hg];B[li]LB[hh:A]C[Delay connecting for one more move, since allowing white to play N11 seems too good for him.

--

A would be better, black has no option but to escape. Then black must connect and hope white won’t be able to reduce the other eye.]
;W[kj]C[I think white should hane instead.

--

Hane would be good for black.];B[jg]C[And I connect. Can white kill me here? I wonder.]
;W[hj]C[once again, I wouldn't have played this move since I don't have an obvious way to run in that direction.

--

Well, this is where black’s should’ve came, so this is natural way to try to kill black.]
;B[hh]C[trying to either connect to F10, which would be big, assuming I'll still live somehow, or capture the H13 stones thus making life easy.]
;W[gi]C[Maybe I should just hane here and take the two stones. But I wasn't sure if that's enaugh and also if that actually lives...]
;B[gh]C[Intending to counterattack the center in case white decides to save the H13 stones.]
;W[fi]C[Then I decide that it's too slow to save those stones, as white has a very solid lead now by taking the whole bottom of the board, and instead I try to attack white's heavy group before coming back and trying to live.]
;B[md];W[nd]
(;B[ni]C[This might be an overplay.

--

Yes, this is overplay.];W[lj];B[mj]C[not getting my stones die...]
;W[kb]C[Wonder what to do here. Can I separate white? Should I try, in any case?]
;B[mc]C[This move doesn't seem the most disconnecting one, but I thought maybe it helps me make eyes.]

;W[kc];B[jc];W[me];B[le];W[id]C[white's saying that he'll kill me and does indeed have a lot more liberties than me. A capturing race is out of the question. Fortunately I manage to live. First, however I play P18, which white should respond more actively to than he did, I think.]
;B[ob];W[nb];B[jd]C[--

This is basically a life and death problem now. White to kill. My opponent didn't manage to kill me. It almost looks like it should be possible.

I’ll skip through many of the comments, as they are just reading related. Please put the stones for them by yourself.]

(;W[lb]C[I completely missed that this threatens to capture the N16 stones for a guaranteed eye in gote. Still wonder if M17 isn't a better move even so. I decide to prevent the N14 eye before turning to his base. However maybe I should try something different entirelly, since white cannot be killed here, I believe. In the game, as I said, I missed the N16 stones being an eye for white.]

Connecting at M16 would be two points bigger.];W[pc]C[I thought for a long time here and decided that I could still kill by playing the 3-3 point.]

;B[ra];W[sa]C[I guess at this point a pretty big ko fight ensues that white will probably win, since he has many local threats and I have none. The game is lost for black at this point. I mess up even worse and misread that playign like this just lets white live altogether. In the next couple moves I blunder 4-5 times.]
;B[rd];W[sc];B[na];W[ma];B[ka];W[qe];B[pe];W[re]C[Now that white is alive without any doubt and I've lost most of my right side, I wonder if capturing the G17 stones is big enaugh right now? maybe a move around O8 is bigger?]

P11 is safe move, white has nothing to lose from it, so it should be played.

But isn’t black still kinda ahead?];B[og]C[This move is huge mistake though, P18 stones means nothing.]
;W[oj];B[mk]C[And so is N9, for same reason. This is only good if you can capture L10, but that group is only worth 4 stones, so 8 points, so it makes little sense until late endgame.
