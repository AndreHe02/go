C[romanwahoo: hi gl
JasonC: Hello.];B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[pe];W[jd];B[gc]C[SGF: Way too early.]
;W[nd]LB[jd:A][ld:C][ge:B]C[SGF: two problems with this move.  First, it does not punish B for his impudent invaions.  Second, it is too far from A.  Once black jumps out to B, as he should, then he is theatening to invade at C.  This makes this wide extension very weak.  

Black has some alternative stretagies here.  One would be to cap at B and see how black responds.  If black tries to live in the top then white can play the left side start point and start a moyo.]
;B[hd]LB[ld:C][ge:A][df:B]C[sgf: Not bad, but a one point jump to A is better overall because it threatens both B and C]
;W[fe]C[Too weak. Does not really theaten black, not does it secure any territory or strength]
;B[hf];W[jf];B[db]C[Contradicts black's previous.  He should do one or the other but not both.]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[fc]C[This really does not protect because it forces black to connect.  Better to extend down the left and leave this for later.]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[ec];W[hc]C[sgf: pointless. letting B get a ponnuki is huge but this does not strengthen W much.]
;B[fd];W[ic]C[sgf: W has left his left group very weak.  The top group can take care of itself but the left cannot.  Also, the white territory at the top os open at the right so white cannot expect much there.]
;B[ge]LB[dg:A]C[sgf: Pointless.  Just forces white to strengthen himself.  Contact moves when attacking at rarely good. 'A' looks good.....]
;W[dg]C[..... and that is exactly where white plays !];B[mc]
LB[nb:A]C[sgf:  this can be cut off so it is not so strong.  A slide to 'A' would be  better.   But there is no rush to play here because white is stable and there is not a lot of territory at stake compared to other parts of the board.]

(;W[md];B[nc];W[qg]LB[od:A]C[sgf:  Must play 'A'.  Letting black bend at that point is too good for him.]
;B[qf]LB[qe:A]C[sgf: If black is intending to attack then this is not the right move - contact moves rarely are.  If he is trying to defend then 'A' is better]
;W[od];B[oc];W[qd];B[pd];W[rf];B[qe];W[og];B[ld];W[le];B[kc]
;W[kd];B[lc];W[nf]LB[pm:A]C[sgf: good sequence for white if he had ended with sente, but with black free to paly at 'A' the wall is not so useful.]
;B[qk]TR[pp]C[sgf:  To close to the white wall.  White can bide his time and aim at eventually invading between the marked stones.]
;W[pn]LB[jp:A][qq:B]C[I wanted to reduce his moyo, but I wasn't sure if R6 was better than this, with the option of jumping into the corner.  I think his response was kind of mild though.

sgf:  this is not a moyo, it is a liability.  Black should not be planning on moving here anytime soon because he would be overconcentrated at the expense of expanding along the lower side. Also, even if white plays the lower star point and black does play this point then white has sente to make his own even bigger moyo.  Best move for white it to play at 'A' and see what black does. He can always invade at 'B' later.]

(;B[qm]C[sgf: Awful.  This move says "please separate my two stones from the corner so that they are weak and can be attacked.  Black must jump out.]
;W[qn];B[qi];W[oi]LB[rg:A]C[sgf: no good. Black can connect by playing 'A']

(;B[pi]C[sgf: heavy.];W[pm];B[rm];W[nq];B[oq];W[qq]LB[np:A]
C[sgf: Impatient.  Just extend to, forcing black to play again in the corner, after which white can stake a nice position at the bottom.  Both players are preoccupied with making small invasions instead of expanding to open up new areas.]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[rn];W[ro];B[np]LB[qo:A]C[sgf:  What has white gained? He cannot afford to pull out this single stone because a black cut at 'A' is sente against the corner and so black is in no trouble.]
;W[or];B[pq];W[pr];B[nr];W[rr];B[mq]C[sgf: Very bad for white. a small live in the corner in exchange for a strong outside black group.]
;W[ok]LB[rg:A]C[sgf: black is not threatened because of the move at 'A' so sealing him in is premature.  A play on the left side is more urgent]
;B[ph]C[sgf: Hopeless, this ruins any chance of connecting this group out.]
;W[pg];B[oh]
(;W[ni]C[sgf: should block. having make so much effort to build a wall white could not let it be breached to easily.]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[ng];W[of];B[mg];W[mf];B[lg]C[sgf: This is sort of the equivalent of the Great Wall collapsing.]
;W[kf]LB[jg:A]C[M14 better?  Secure one eye with another eyeshape?  I felt like I was very far behind now, because he reduced all the outside influence I had.  I didn't know how to prevent it though.

sgf: probably is, but  'A' is even better.];B[kh];W[rh]C[sgf: what is the point of this?  B is not threatened as he is out]
;B[re]LB[mm:A]C[sgf: 'A' is a much better way to connect.];W[pl]
;B[ri]LB[qo:A]C[sgf:  Black is out so not threatened.  This is an endgame move.  Black shout cut at 'A' and attack.]
;W[dl]LB[qo:A]C[sgf: About time!  Although it might be too late.  If black cuts at 'A' then white will have to defend the group above and in the process black will probably end up getting the strength to invade the left side.]
;B[gq];W[dr]LB[eq:A]C[sgf: 'A' is better.];B[jq]LB[ip:A]C[sgf:  Way too over concetrated.  The lower right is strong and you should never play close to strength. 'A' is correct. White cannot invade the bottom because it your just create another weak group]
;W[cj];B[cn]LB[dn:A]C[I feel like I should be able to kill this stone, but I'm not very confident, so I played C5 next.  I'd like to know how to play the next series of moves

sgf:  This move cannot be killed. All white can do it seal it in and hope the the outside strength which is gained can be put to use.  'A' is the only move.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[fo]LB[fp:A]C[sgf:  white is not strong enough for this because it can be cut. 'A' is better.]
;B[eo];W[ep];B[fn];W[go];B[gm];W[gn];B[fm];W[fk];B[hm]C[sgf: Black should probably cut.]
;W[fp];B[hp]LB[hm:A][qo:B]C[sgf:  Not needed.  White cannot invade and the corner is strong enough to survive an attack.  With the stone at 'A' sticking out, now is the time to cut at 'B']
;W[fr];B[gr];W[in];B[im];W[kn];B[mn];W[io];B[lm];W[kp];B[kq]
;W[jl]C[sgf: Nice looking move for white, but black will probalby not have any  trouble surviving and the white group to the right is looking weaker and weaker.]
;B[jm]C[sgf: why?];W[km];B[hk];W[jj];B[gj];W[fi];B[ii];W[hh]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[ei];W[fh];B[di];W[dj]C[sgf: Black is giving white free territory here.]

;W[ak];B[cl];W[ck];B[bl];W[dh];B[el];W[ci]C[I think this is unnecessary now that I have the time to read it out properly]
;B[ek];W[bn]LB[ll:A]C[sgf: small. 'A' is much better];B[dm]
C[sgf: even smaller];W[dk]C[sgf: even smaller still];B[bm]TR[bb]
[jb][se][ll][gs]C[sgf:  Both players are playing small engame move when there are much bigger points at all the places marked.]
;W[bo];B[do];W[em]C[Last stab at killing this group, I know it doesn't really help.]
;B[fl];W[am]C[sgf: 3 points in double gote with a gote followup worth another 6 points.  This is very small at this stage of the game.  Any 2 point sente move is bigger.]
;B[en]C[sgf: 6 points in double gote. smaller than 2 points in sente.]

sgf:  won because you made fewer small move in the yose than the opponent.  But there were plenty of opportunities for each player to put this game away during the middle game.  I have commented on most of them.]
