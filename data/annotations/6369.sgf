C[Hello and thanks for reviewing my game. I played white in this game. The opening started off ok, but as the middle game progressed he ended up with a good position while attacking one of my groups and I lost by a few points. Would you please comment on the direction of play in the game and where I made bad decisions? Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you!

;B[nd];W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[rb]C[This was a hard decision. Extending around R11/R12 is normal, I think, but the S18 stone seems to make the group a little unstable. On the other hand, any other move would leave the group even more open to attack. Is there another sequence that would have been more appropriate here instead of R17 and following?]

(;W[qh];B[kd];W[qm]C[I wanted expand the upper right in order to make a better base, but approaching at r5 would leave a big gap around r8. I expected black to play either r5 or n3. Since the bottom left group is also low, I thought this would be good for white, but...

*this leaves w too low and thin on the right, too optimistic to hope b make corner territory]
;B[pg]C[..black did this];W[qg];B[pf];W[qf];B[qk]C[I considered attaching at q9, but thought black would build thickness in the middle and make the game hard for white.]

;B[nl]C[This was probably not the worst move black could have played, but I didn't know how to treat r7 now.]
;W[np]C[This move took a while to choose. I decided to abandon r7 and either settle on the lower side or build a moyo in the middle while forcing black to protect the corner.]
