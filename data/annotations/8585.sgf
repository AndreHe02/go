[fq][gq][hq][oq][br]C[hello dear reviewer,

this is a 3 handicap game between me (3k) and a very experienced 1dan player. I won the game by 26 points.

while reviewing game, my opponent heavily criticized two of my moves. we talked a lot but i'm still not convinced. i still think they are good moves and seek a higher level player's opinion.

thanks in advance]PL[B]
(;B[me]LB[kd:A][md:B]C[i've been criticized for this move.

my idea and aim was:
1. kill the aji of L17
2. prevent escaping of O17
3. secure territory on corner
4. i will next want to play N10. N15 works fine with it

it's said, this move sould be better at somewhere else on the board. if I really want to kill the aji I shold directly capture the L17 stone with A. they also showed me some sequences that O17 cannot escape. it may not escape now but its aji remains.

I still think N15 is a good move here. what do you think? where would you play?

reid:  Hello hakan.  It is interesting to work on just these two questions.  Not at all the usual game analysis.  My usual preference is to try to deal with issues that come up much earlier than this stage of the game.  Often the game has already been decided by mistakes much earlier.  However, this game could still go either way.  

I agree that fixing the aji is a good idea.  I think N15 is a pretty good way to do it.  My only quibble would be that I would rather see N15 a bit tighter, at B (N16) instead.  Not a huge difference, but N16 is a bit better at keeping O17 under control while still capturing L17 firmly.

Any argument about capturing L17 outright with A requires a line of aji that exploits the weakness.  There might be some endgame starting with white M18.  If then black L19, white A and black L15.  This aji won't work if black is at B (N16), but it does for black N15.  With black N15, black has to capture at A instead of blocking at L19, so there is some endgame loss from N15.  But I think capturing at A is a bit slow when B works.]

(;B[mj]LB[qh:A][qm:B]TR[rj]C[this is the second move criticized.

he said, as Q10 stone is on the forth line, the area under it is not secure, so this jump does not add much to black's potential. if Q10 was on 3rd line, this jump will be a very good move, now it isn't. it should be better at A or B. both secures territory

i agree that if Q10 was on the 3rd line this move will be much better but it's still good enough. it's better than A and B.

my reasoning is as follows: this jump creates box shape at upper right and lower right parts of the board. white can erase one of them but during the process other will possibly be black's territory. this move develops black's power in center. after this move, if black gets a chance a move at A or B or at marked position will be much more meaningful.

in actual game, white slided to S10 and lived there. black made territory in center. white tried to deeply invade center territory but died.

what do you think? where would you play?

reid: White has a very large left-side already which means black needs to secure a large part of the right side to compensate (the upper right corner is only about half the size of white's left side).

Given the white stones at J6, the area around M7 is difficult to turn into territory (for either side).  Similarly, the stones at F15 and E11 make the area around J12 a no-man's land.  Finally, if white can live with the R14 stone (or use its aji to make a living group somewhere in this area), then the right side area is greatly reduced.

So I agree that keeping R14 under control is more important than the center area right now.  But I disagree with the suggested moves A and B.  First, A certainly kills R12, but it leaves a lot of aji on the B side.  On the other hand, B just invites white to try to live with R10 or S10.

I would prefer to see black R10.  This makes it very difficult for white to live on either side.  Probably his best chance is to attach at R4 or something similar.  But this could be dangerous: the white J16 stones have a bit of aji left, so white doesn't want another weak group in this area.  In any case, even if black can live somewhere around B, black R10 makes a bigger territory around R14 than black A.]
