Hi, I'm sisyph, your reviewer. My comments will begin with some dashes. I'm about 5k on kgs. Take that into account when reading my comments. 

You've asked for a level evaluation. I'm not sure I can do that. Anyway, playing slow game on kgs will give you a more accurate level than any I can give you. Play and enjoy Go that's what is important ^^

--
The usual approach of a takamoku (kakari) are at A or B. Your move is also possible, but with stones closer, I think. What you have to consider is not the joseki but the whole situation and where you want to go. By playing takamoku white emphasize influence and the left border. Your approach go with white plans, abandon the corner, but works with your hoshi. Anyway at our levels, this is not a losing move ^^

See http://www.eidogo.com or http://www.josekipedia.com to rapidly browse josekis.

Remember that what's important is not to learn joseki but to STUDY them. That's mean understanding why one should play here or there. A good way is to study the ones deriving from a position you have encountered in a game like here.  

Maybe the best thing is to play elsewhere like around C to get a chinese opening.]

Well, here you see why your previous move is not joseki. I cannot see a good move for Black.]

(;B[ic]LB[kc:C][nc:D][ee:A][qk:B]TR[db][dc]C[--
Hum. You are left with the aji of the triangled stones.

A move at B or at another big point is tempting, but then White could use the aji to enlarge his framework. 

Anyway, your move is too close to your corner. To minimize aji and enlarge my framework I will play at the limit of the stones, around A. If you want to go for the upper side, play further to the right to have a more balanced formation, at C or even further at D. B is also playable I think. In any case, then White will be able to play A.]

Usually bad to invade this side. there is more room at the bottom. the D10 stone works like an already in place loose pincer.

Moreover, you should not go away from the fight on the upper left ! Here there is two weak groups. The first player who can get the upper hand will gain something !

A is all the more good as you have J17.
B is the key point for the fight.
C is better direction to approach D4.

A good rule of thumb is :

- FIRST : strengthen your weak groups.
- SECOND : Attack opponent weak groups according to your strategy.
- THEN : take any big/good point according to your strategy.

It is important to defend else your opponent will use your weaknesses to get the upper hand !]

[sf][qg][rg][sg][qh][sh][qi]C[Trying my luck. Any better way to invade?

--

Well, the first thing to consider if whether you have to invade, reduce or just consolidate your territory. In order to decide, you have to count !

If you count, you can see that you have about 30 points (triangles).
White have only 15 points (squares).
You are leading in term of territory.

White have more potential territory than you about 20 (left side) against 10 for you (upper side).
That's means that even if you let white close the left border while you close the upper side, you will lead the game !

You have also to consider weak groups.

If you kill the white group at A, you get more than 30 points !!! As it seems already dead, that means you lead and can play safe moves just to consolidate your lead.

If you play B, White can only get a false eye and have to live, while you will get territory !

There is aji at C and the reduction around D. 

E remains a good point.

This considered, the way to win is to play simple moves to just win ^^ 
The invasion favors white, as he will try to complicate the game !

More than that, with the invasion, white can use the ajiof his two corner stones !

You should play B, then E to get points and force white to close his territory, and win ^^

I've tried some variations ...

By the way for an invasion, it is not a bad point ^^]

^^

Well, white gets a ponnuki and the fight will get complicated. J13 seems better locally. 

You were leading from early in the game. Try to estimate points to decide what to do. When you lead play simple, sure moves. And do not try funny yose move to optimize your win, unless you lose because of time ^^

Concerning your level, I think that you can easily gain one or two stones by following my great advices ^^. The best thing to do is to play slow game (1h+) on kgs. That's the most accurate level you will have.

Enjoy go, the level will come naturally ^^.
