C[doesn [4k\]: hi gg
Beykakua [4k\]: hello, have fun

Thanks reviewer!
I'm espiecally interested in improving my direction of play but anything else you could comment on would of course be much appreciated!

Thank you kindly!
George

milo: ok, happy to share my ideas.];B[pd]C[doesn [4k\]: you too!]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[op];B[oq]C[milo: this is a good choice, normally it is sente for black, and there is still an open corner]
;W[nq];B[pq];W[ed]C[milo: taking the open corner now is probably white's only option.

whenever white does not defend o4, you can think about cutting immediately]
;B[cd]C[milo: I would also play in the upper corner.

C16 is the most common move..

I also consider D14 in this situation, it gives white the corner, but that's not really what white wants with E16]
;W[df];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[hd]C[milo: this looks unusual, normally white should connect at F16 or G16.

I'm really not sure the best way to punish white.  I would probably stick with the joseki move of B14 and be content that white's shape has a weakness that wouldn't be there if he/she had played joseki.]
;B[ee];W[de];B[fd];W[dd]C[milo: this way you are going to lose the corner]
;B[gc];W[fb];B[gb]C[milo: I wouldn't have played this way, because white can take the corner by cutting at C17 now.  B cannot play atari.]

(;W[gd];B[fe];W[hb];B[eb]C[milo: this way is good for black]
;W[hc];B[fa]C[milo: white is cut in two groups, both without eyes.  black is ahead.

you should try to avoid letting white make a base for both groups.  kind of miai]
;W[nc]TR[ne][pf]C[would it be unreasonable to pincer this - w's stones stones are pretty weak i guess.

---
milo: yes

white shape is almost ideal (O17 at N17).

pincer's are normally good on an open board, or when you are (entending from / enlarging) your own framework.

Invading such a small area now is a kind of jealous play, you don't want your opponent to have any points.  There are many open areas of the board that are bigger (D9, J4, Q10 areas).

In this case, white can jump out at 015.  Black will have a hard time because his pincer will almost be enclosed, and if black defends his pincer stone, white will get both O15 and Q14 (whenever I make the triangle shape, I think "game over").

Black should focus on getting sente to play around D11 now, a move there has the potential to take control of the game by attacking.

Jumping into the small L17 area without support in the center would create a weak black group (there isn't room for two eyes in the L17 area), and would give white the potential to take control by attacking.]
;B[pf]C[milo: I would play here too.  Now you can invade the L17 area or get D11]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pb]
(;B[od]C[milo: i might have taken sente here, but would probably defend the cormer at R18.  Attacking O17 and D14 are still miai, even after white's P16 sente.]
;W[qb];B[rc];W[nd]
(;B[cn]C[this maybe seems a little slack...

milo: I think it would be better to deprive D14 of eyes with a move around D11, thereby creating a weak group that white must run with. then a black kakari at C6 will also be an extension.

You should always be on the lookout for the opportunity to create a weak group (not enough room for two eyes on the side/corner) that you can chase.

in your variation, I see you did think about D11.  Yes, missing that point was the biggest mistake in your direction of play that I saw.]
;W[cl]C[milo: a pincer here extends from friendly stones, the opposite of the situation for black in the upper right.]
;B[fp];W[eo];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[ip]
(;B[dm]C[milo: D5 is usually a key point in this double kakari shape.  Then you should still be targeting D11.]
;W[fm];B[dl];W[dk];B[ck];W[cj];B[bk];W[bj]C[milo: the corner is big, but now white D14 is no longer vulnerable.  O4 is interesting now]
;B[bl];W[ce];B[bd];W[be];B[ek];W[dj];B[fl];W[gm];B[np]C[milo: good]
;W[mq];B[no];W[qk];B[qi];W[pn];B[oo];W[pj];B[kq]C[milo: this is good, you found a weak group.]
;W[lp]C[milo: this is usually an overplay, the correct move is probably L4.  black can probably play L4 right now]
;B[iq];W[kp];B[jp];W[jo];B[jq];W[hp];B[hq];W[gq];B[gp];W[gr]
C[milo: white is unreasonable, black should win];B[io];W[ho]
;B[ko];W[jn];B[lo];W[lq];B[hr];W[er];B[lr];W[mr]
(;B[ks]C[i would play L2 instead, keep things simple,  black just has more liberties.  Also with L1 at L2, black M1, the key point for depriving white of an eye, is sente for life.]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[or]C[milo: black can still win unconditionally by playing N1 now.  This turned out to be a big loss for black.]

(;B[pr];W[ns];B[ps];W[hs];B[os];W[is]C[milo: black can still win unconditionally in double ko by playing at N1 now, still better than the game, in which white got 3 moves on the outside]

(;B[mp];W[ro]C[milo: 1 move on the outside];B[nr];W[nf]C[milo: 2 moves on the outside.  black should respond on the outside now, because if w retakes the ko, unconditional win in double ko is still available.]

(;B[ms];W[hg]C[milo: 3 moves on the outside, a big loss for black.]
;B[kh];W[oh];B[ph];W[qe];B[qd];W[pg];B[qg];W[og];B[kk];W[pe]
;B[qf];W[oe];B[re];W[ki]C[milo: it's important to be flexible in situations like this, don't try to save every stone]

(;B[li]C[milo: maybe the other way at K11 or J12 is better, black has two escape routes at F15 and F8]
;W[ji];B[lh]C[milo: this way is dangerous];W[lj];B[kj];W[mj]

;B[ie];W[jd];B[je];W[ke];B[kf]C[milo: this may be a wasted move]
;W[kd];B[ae];W[af];B[ad];W[bg];B[ni]C[milo: this stone should probably die]

;W[ne];B[ng];W[mh];B[nh];W[mg];B[kn];W[jm];B[km];W[fj];B[jl]
;W[gf]
(;B[ge]C[milo: you lose liberty by playing here, making it harder to connect.  it looks like you can connect by playing E13 instead

see variation];W[he];B[fg]C[milo: E13 is probably still the way]
;W[ff];B[ej]C[milo: now white can F11 and black may be in trouble]

(;W[ei]C[see variation];B[fi];W[fk];B[eh]C[milo: nice];W[el]
;B[ef];W[ll];B[kl];W[rj];B[il];W[hn];B[ha];W[ia]C[milo: white really wants 2 points.  even a small ko threat ignored would be good for black]

;B[ch];W[bh];B[ha];W[cb];B[bb];W[ga];B[id]C[milo: this probably erases the ko]
;W[ic];B[jb];W[jc]
(;B[kb]C[milo: this move is a total waste.  white got his 2 points, but you didn't get your 2 moves on the outside.

even if you capture the ko, white can play L18, so your move at J16 was bad]
;W[ha];B[rp];W[sg];B[rn];W[sf];B[rf];W[rm];B[se];W[sh];B[qo]
;W[qn];B[so];W[hf];B[cr];W[gi];B[fh];W[ci]C[milo: this is where black needs to play c19]

(;B[dr];W[dh]C[milo: there is no ko, black's big group is dead, the game is pretty much over, but there was something interesting around R9]

;B[fs];W[gs];B[ol];W[eg];B[ok];W[om];B[pl];W[ql];B[pm];W[rl]
LB[ca:B][sk:C][pr:A]TR[gf]C[milo: last chance  to win... black T9 now kills everything.

You played well, and did well against white's aggressive opening.

You lost due to reading errors (A, B, C).  I think your direction of play was good, except for missing D11.

Try to identify opportunities like D11 to prevent an opponent group from having space to make two eyes on the side or corner, and profit by chasing it.  Also, try to avoid creating weak groups of your own by invading small areas like L17 without support in the center (as in your question about pincer), especially when there are bigger open areas on the board.

Try to develop a sense that "my next move is especially important".  When this sense is triggered, slow down and try to read as far you can.  The semiai around A, white threatening to cut at "triangle", and white's killable shape around C should all have triggered this sense.  In each case there was a move available to you that would have won the fight unconditionally.  Allocate some additional thinking time in your games for when this sense is triggered.  Pushing yourself to read furthur during intense moments of games, even casual games, is a good way to improve.

Thanks for sharing you game,

Michael]
