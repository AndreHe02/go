C[I my last review, the person who reviewed my game said that I have to work at protecting my groups. Since then, I have won more games. However, in this game I lost on territory.  My opponent took a large part of the center. I feel like I should have attacked him more. However I didnâ€™t want to have too many groups to protect.

LWG: 
Hi, I am your reviewer for today ^_^ I hope that my thoughts are helpful for you. I would however like to point out, that the more questions you add to your review, the more suitable information you'll get ;). I will go as detailed into this game as possible.]
;B[pd]C[flam [6k\]: hi];W[qq]C[tingo [5k\]: hi];B[dd];W[cq]
C[LWG:
This is an odd fuseki for white. It is playable, but very low and black can take advantage of this as you do with a shoulderhit.]
;B[pp]C[I saw this shoulder hit in 38 basic Josekes. The joseki went a little differently than in the book.

LWG:
This is the correct move, you can look at the variations for the joseki.]
;W[qp];B[po]
(;W[qo]C[LWG:
This is an unusual move because most players feel it is too low and therefore doesn't play it. Look at the variations for other josekis to this move.]
(;B[pn]
(;W[qn]C[LWG:
This move is not recommended since Blacks influence gets bigger and bigger, and whites territory does not expand on the same level as blacks influence. Look at the variations for other possible moves for white.]
(;B[mp]C[LWG:
This move is not good in this situation. I think your afraid of letting white play N4 instead of you and thereby forcing you to fight for survival for your group, but this is not necessary in this situation. See variation for alternative moves.]
;W[pm]C[LWG:
White takes advantage of Blacks mistake and extends to the 4th file instead of the 3rd file.]
;B[qj]C[LWG:
This move is good and prevents white from taking too much territory in this area.]
;W[nr]
(;B[pq]C[I wonder if m2 would have been better here.

LWG:
This move is a forcing move, so it is good. M2 could be a followup move. Playing M2 directly is dangerous since White is already connected (see variation).]
;W[pr];B[om]C[LWG:
Another forcing move. This is the kinds of moves you need when you want to secure your group.]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[pk];B[qg]C[LWG:
Another very good move, you've secured yourself a lot of territory.
I should however note that these moves are against your first play, which focused on influence, but now you focus on territory. It is better to have a sort of balance in your play, and not play to disbalance yourself.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[was this the right direction?

LWG: If you did not have a stone at R13 this would be the right direction. Your stones are now too close however, and you become overconcentrated with these moves.
See variation for other moves.];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb]
;B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
(;B[qf]C[LWG:
This move is not too necessary right now. I know it is normally joseki, but you already have a stone at R13 for support so it is not needed right now. (see variation to see what white can do if you dont play at R14.)]
;W[ok]C[LWG: 
You focused on the center, but because of your earlier mistake, it is now possible for white to enter into the center and steal some of it from you.]
;B[lm];W[jd];B[dj];W[cn]C[LWG:
White focuses too much on territory. Normally you would play around D6 or F4, because the 3-3 point is quite low already.]
;B[gp]C[LWG:
This is a good move to gain more influence.];W[fq]
(;B[jp]C[LWG: Instead of this move, you can first play a forcing move at G3 or F4 (see variations)]

;W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[cf]
C[I could be wrong, but this board position looks good to me.

LWG:
White made a mistake by entering your corner by the 3-3 point. He hurt his own K16 stone, which is now very very weak.]
;W[jf]C[I wonder if I should have played L15 here

LWG:
It is hard to tell how to attack in this situation, I do however doubt L15 would work unless your opponent makes a mistake (see variation)]
(;B[mg]C[LWG:
I would not recommend this move. White has all 4 corners and black is therefore forced to take some territory now. Besides, his Q16 group is already safe. Remember you only need two eyes to be alive. I would prefer to attack differently (see variation)]
;W[le];B[me]C[LWG: 
When you attack, a move that connects you to your opponents stone is (almost always) bad. This move is a move you play to save yourself, but your group is not in danger, and it helps setteling your opponents group.]
;W[lf];B[mf];W[kh];B[hf]C[A good move to take territory. You could however also play K10 and force white to move towards your strong E17 group.]
;W[kj];B[mj]C[LWG:
In this situation there is little reason to make sure whites groups are not connected, you need territory. A move around H11 is better.]
;W[hi]C[LWG:
Now white destroyed alot of your side territory, and at the same time makes seki of his own group.]
;B[hk]C[At this point I'm just trying to protect my groups.]
;W[kl];B[km];W[jl];B[cl];W[fi];B[eh];W[gg]
(;B[ff]C[LWG: 
A move at H16 is better in order to make sure white doesn't get any more territory. There might even end up being unexplored options there.

It is however hard to tell since white is leading by quite a bit right now, and you therefore needs drastic measures in order to have a chance.]
;W[gf];B[fe];W[he];B[ic];W[id];B[jc];W[oi];B[oh];W[pi];B[qi]
;W[ph];B[qh]C[LWG:
A move at P13 would be better.];W[pg];B[of];W[pf];B[pe];W[nh]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[qk]C[LWG:
Better would be R8];W[og];B[ng];W[mh];B[lg];W[kg];B[ir];W[hs]
C[LWG:
White should play at G2 instead.];B[is];W[gr];B[mb];W[jm]C[LWG:
White is doing well decreasing your territory while getting better attacking posibilities.]
;B[jn];W[oq];B[op];W[nl];B[nm];W[ml];B[mm];W[ll];B[lr];W[hl]
;B[gl];W[hm];B[gm]C[LWG:

;B[gb];W[hc];B[hb];W[ge];B[na];W[pa]C[Is there anything that I can do to the two white groups at the top?

LWG:
No, All of whites corner groups are safe. You can only slightly decrease the territory as you do later.]
;B[sd];W[rb]C[LWG:
Normally white play at S19 in order to secure themselves.];B[fa]
;W[da];B[ba];W[bb];B[ad]C[LWG:
White would be better off defending at C19, which secures an eye (see variation)]
(;W[ac];B[ga];W[ca];B[db];W[cb];B[ea];W[aa];B[ae];W[mq]C[LWG:
Black should defend at O4 (see variation)]
(;B[lq];W[np];B[no]C[LWG:
Beware of your own weaknesses. White can give a ko threat for entering your territory. (see variation)]

LWG:
All in all you play a good game. I could see by your own comments and your placement of stones, that you truly listened to what the previous reviewer told you and protected your weak groups.
What I will tell you is not to protect your groups, but to protect your 'weak' groups. In this game you had alot of strong groups, but you still protected them when a weak white group went close to your strong black group.

Protect when your group is weak. Attack when your group is strong.

A proverb says that there is a time for everything. A time to defend, and a time to attack. 

You played a solid game, and only made a few mistakes. Try to read further ahead, so you can see what consequences your moves have for future play. Else your only big mistake is when you defend in places where you don't need to defend and attack when you don't need or can't atack.

Good luck in future play. Hope the comments helped you out. If there is something I missed, please write on my email (lagu03@hotmail.com).

To your Go success!!!])
