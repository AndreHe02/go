;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[fq];W[hq]C[note that when B enters the corner and you block at D3, your wall faces a low position. you would have sente, though.]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[:)];B[cp];W[co]C[a mistake. B should now hane-and-connect, then cut. see variation.]

(;B[bo];W[cn];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bn];W[cm];B[fc]C[reducing the bottom is more urgent by far.
both the upper side and the left are unattractive now, because of B6-C7 (assuring no one gets much territiry there ) and the solid-low position of L17. also, there is no real shimari from a star-point. so, a move around N4-M4 feels right here. let W approach your star-point if he likes.
 For W,the Q8 kikashi-Q6 combination is nice now, but maybe leaves a valley too big.  maybe just O6 now.]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[pn]C[this is ok too, inviting B in.];B[pm]C[this is much too slow, you strengthens W's walls. don't worry about W r5 - if he does, descend. rush in to reduce the moyo.K4 is probably too deep now, so K5 seems to be  the move. W will probably still cap, but you have a fighting chance . alternatively, K6 id cautios but gives a lot of territory. I'm not sure which is better. anyway, W is in superior position now. even if you go in and live, the thickness W will get will give him the advantage.]
;W[om];B[qm];W[on];B[iq]C[way too deep. W H4, and you have nowhere to go, no weaknesses to lean against. B shoud die here. W can cap at the 8th line because of his high walls, so even a jump to the 6th line won't get you out; so , W can answer solidly at the bottom, knowing you can't get out.]
;W[ip]C[this is too soft on B. a crosscut would get B some options for sabaki because of F3 stone.  don't touch what you are attacking.]
;B[jq];W[jp]C[looks like B is going to live after all. W is blocking from above instead of denying eyespace from below as with H2. why block B from a direction where he can't run away ?]
;B[hr];W[hp]C[again, not pressing hard enough. should G3. if B f2, W g2.]
;B[lq]
(;W[gr]C[missing the vital point. L4 threatens L2. W can even ignore B G2 - B can't get out from there either, see variations.]
;B[kp];W[kn]C[L2 is still better than capping. if B M2,W l5. B lives, with O2 etc, but is shut in more tightly.]
;B[ln];W[lm];B[ko];W[jn];B[mn];W[mm];B[mp]C[good play by B. W supplied the chance, but B knew how to take it.]
;W[mr];B[lr]C[time for a pause. the dust has settled, let's estimate the board.

first, count safe territories : B has some 9 pts at LR, 4 at mid-L, 10 at LR , potential for 30 overall right side if B defends there. If W invades, UR will be around 8 pts. average of 18 and 30 + 24 pts. UL is not territory yet, but should count as 15 pts. total estimate 52 pts.
W has some 8 pts on Upper group, about 8 on LR, and some 12 safe points in the big valley.
W has sente.

W needs to make his thickness worth over 30 additional points (or 20 pts + reducing B's right and upper-left without giving territorial compensation)

Certainly doable. I'd start with W D13 or D12. B would probably play C9, W B7, and a fight again.]
;W[qh]C[for B, I'd just respond once at R13, and after W Q12, tenuki to take D11.]
;B[qg];W[ph];B[oj]C[this is ok too, but after W O12, B has no chase.]
;W[qe]C[ok as a probe, I hope W does not mean a full attac.]
;B[rg];W[nh]C[good. but B now gas sente to take the big point. so, the invasion at R12 seems premature.]
;B[ne]C[??
not leaning against W - W does not have to respond at upper side. W just plays N11 and increases his center big time.]
;W[be]C[big mistake, totally wrong direction.
W should build on his biggest asset in the game - the thickness around G7. so , extend on a large scale, invite B to come in, then attack.
this low move allows B to press from above and negate W's thickness - in sente. then B can take N10, further negating thickness while chasing
(since W missed N11), and B has more solid territory.];B[bd]

(;B[cc]C[see variation for a tougher answer.];W[ce];B[bc]C[painful ! D12 is screaming !]
