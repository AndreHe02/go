C[Drear Reviewer.

I would have won this game (better you look at it yourself at the end)
but I had not the feeling that this was an easy win. Thats the reason I'm sending it in.

It was sometimes very confusing and I often thought about trying new moves, but wasn't always sure about the outcome.

I was often told that I am very weak at Joseki, I would like to know if the hole is really that big.

I really want to improve my game and would like to know how I can achieve this. What are my biggest problems?

And I'm very weak at calculating the result - I wasn't sure who's leading the whole game long until the end. How can I learn this?

Thank you very much for taking your time to review this and excuse my bad english.

;B[jq];W[iq];B[ir];W[jp]C[H2?
 I wanted to play something else and ended up playing K4, but now I think that this isn't a very good move.

Fernobob: K4 isn't bad. It makes a nice full triangle shape with K3 which is strong and prevents black from extending upwards at all. Now you have an excellent influential shape. In this context, I believe that it might be called the thousand dolar turn.

H2 gains a few points locally but at such an early stage in the game, this really isn't very big and if black invades, he will be wasting moves, as long as you don't try and limit the damage. (see variations]

(;B[kq];W[ln]TR[nj]C[Or maybe now G2...

Fernobob: A move like G2 is still pretty small.

The cap that you played is good, though there are other caps, such as O10 which are slightly bigger, just because they prevent developement on both sides, rather than just on the right.]
;B[gq];W[gp]TR[jd]C[Fernobob: This is a kind of strategic mistake. Black isn't gaining very many points by iunvading, but if you try and stop him, he can just gain the points and move somewhere else with a profit. Whgen he makes a small scale invasion like this, you should just accept it and develope somewhere else, like K17.

That said, in this particular instance, your move also works well with your big framework but you probably shouldn't make too many moves like this as most will not do.]
;B[hq];W[fp];B[fq];W[pm]TR[qn][qm]C[P7 or something like that better?

Fernobob: P7 is a bit shallow. It allows black to take Q7 and make a big thing of fourth line territory. What you played is better, though I might be tmpted to go even deeper with R6 or R7. Being on the third line, these moves aim at significantly reducing black's territory and making life quickly, though you could lose out if they're attacked. It's really a matter of opinion I think.]
;B[nn];W[nm];B[mm];W[mn];B[on];W[ml];B[lm];W[km];B[om];W[nl]
TR[mm][lm]C[Fernobob: You should probably capture N7 here. Unfinished ladders can cause huge problems later on and you should try to capture them as soon as possible.]
;B[ol];W[nj];B[ok];W[oh]TR[qe]C[Fernobob: This move is a bit shallow and useless and lets black have lots of territory. You could be more daring and get right in there with R15 or something.]
;B[hm];W[fm]TR[hm]C[I'm not sure about this one

Fernobob: To be honest, neither am I. H7 was a pretty bad move as it doesn't really aim at anything. I might just ignore it as it has little hope of really doing anything. Your move aims at taking some territory if it does live, which is also a good idea though.]
;B[ko];W[jo];B[kn];W[ll]C[Fernobob: That illustrates why you should take ladders quickly.]
;B[jn];W[gn]TR[in]C[Fernobob: This move really doesn't do very much at all. It doesn't secure your territory much more and just lets him connect his stone out. You could try and cut him instead with J6.]
;B[jl];W[jm]C[L10 here better?

Fernobob: L10 wouldn't really achieve anything. K10 is fine.]

(;B[in];W[hn]C[Fernobob: This doesn't do anything and forces him to connect. (See variations)]

;B[qh];W[pe];B[re];W[qd]C[Fernobob: Black's S15 was useless and doesn't really need cutting like that. It punishes itself so you can ignore it. This is similar to H7 (move 37)]
;B[qf];W[pf];B[pg];W[og];B[nf]C[What should I have done to prevent this situation?(Now I have to struggle for life)]
;W[qg];B[rg];W[pg]TR[of]C[Fernobob: you don't need to connect here. If black captures, you can connect at P14.]
;B[qe];W[pd];B[nc];W[rd];B[rh];W[mh];B[lg];W[me]C[Fernobob: You already have a weak group, this doesn't do much and just creates another weak group to worry about.]

C[This forces black to play M11 and remove a of your group. Try to check whether a move will harm your group before you make it.]

;W[je];B[lf];W[hi];B[gg];W[gh]TR[id]C[Where to play to kill (?) black the best way? B had much more potential to harm W...?

Fernobob: white has so much influence here that black can't reasonably hope to live. You should just play defensive moves such as J16 so that it just dies.]

;B[tt]TR[qq]C[So, in the end my IGS crushed right after we both passed and I lost because of "resigning". (to prevent misunterstandings because of the game information)
But that's not very important just a little bit frustrating.

Fernobob:That's a bit dissapointing, but deserving to win is just as good. Overall, your playing is actually pretty good. You just need to not worry about small moves as much and focus on bigger strategic points. Also, you can still invade at R3 and get a ko I think. (see variations)

Thanks for submitting your game. I hope you found the review helpful. I wouldn't worry about not being good at joseki. Most people agree that you don't need them until you're quite a bit stronger.

If you don't know the outcome of new moves, just try them. It's the only ay to find out. The worst that can happen is you lose the game.

Estimating the score is difficult. I actually have big problems with it myself and so maybe I'm not the best person to talk about it, but if you just compare teritories you can get a rough idea. Whites upper right corner is about as big as blacks middle and whites left hand side is bigger than blacks bottom right, so white is probably winning.]

(;B[in];W[im];B[hn];W[il]TR[jl]C[Fernobob: By forcing black to connect hite can cleanly cut off K10. Forcing him to connect the other way loses that potential.]

(;B[hr];W[jd]C[Fernobob: While black is making a small number of points at the bottom, you are expanding large scle. This would put white firmly ahead.]
