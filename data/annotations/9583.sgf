Teachers comments : 
Hello this is Zachary Dunham I will be doing your review. My current ranks are 4.6 dan AGA 2 dan kgs IGS 3 dan and tygem 6 dan.]
;W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[ec]C[This move is a little slow the counter to it is c11 I will leave some variations to make you understand why it is slow.]

(;W[qf]C[Black should play back here because r4 is relatively low and with him pincering he will get bad result.]

(;B[pi]C[This is premature white should o16 to punish.];W[nd]
C[Now you should play on top of him and try and regain some points.]

(;B[oe]C[niallp [4k\]: not joseki. and apparently shortly after blocking the worng way?
Teachers comments:
I explained this earlier in the review.];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[lc]C[a general rule of thumb in go is do not leave weak groups these stones at q16 are weak you should extend here rather then tenuki. letting white play s16 so freely will hurt latter on and a rule of shape is two is bad 3 is okay 4 is excellent.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[od];B[pf];W[ne];B[nf];W[mf];B[ng]
;W[mg]C[Two is bad three is good you should see that in this game.]

(;B[jd];W[nh];B[og];W[rf];B[se];W[sf];B[pg]C[You should be able to see black is over concentrated here he has 13 points for 12 stones gaining one point a stone is not enough.]
;W[qk]C[This move is wrong it touches blacks thickness black can ignore it.]

(;B[mh]C[A strange cut it helps white get rid of his problems.]

(;W[ni]
(;B[fp]C[niallp [4k\]: not really sure what i'm aiming to do with this corner. just played the hi approach to block ladder.what woudl be some other alternatives and why?
Teachers comments:
Normally the high approach is used against big center moyos or for a double approach since neither of those are happening here I would recommend going low.]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[eq]C[Here white chose a bad joseki and should be punished like this.]

(;B[hp]C[playing this move is when white already has thickness towards the bottom right.]

(;W[jp]C[This was premature on whites part black should start a fight here to regain the difference of this overplay by playing g6.]

(;B[iq]C[This move is slow punish playing k3];W[jq];B[oq]C[Now you see it, but the time for action has passed. This is the difference in strength in most dan and kyu's and pro's we can all see what is big the difference is playing it at the right time and in the right order.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[qn]C[niallp [4k\]: some other moves that look ok at first glance follow]

(;B[ri];W[sd];B[pe];W[pm]
(;B[nj];W[mi]C[Those three stones are tiny you should leave them alone.]
;B[lh];W[mc];B[ld];W[me]C[niallp [4k\]: seems to be a couple fo weak groups fighting. had aimed to presssure w middle and K group while staying connected. was it too ambitious? b too weak? what else could i be thinking?
Teachers comments:
You have been making these three mistakes consistently. 1. You don't defend weak groups. 2. you don't play for influence. 3. You try to attack strong groups with weak ones. 
Try not to worry about his groups and worry about your own safety. An army with poorly formed regulations will fall into chaos when the arrows start picking them off.]

(;B[nl];W[mj];B[nk]
(;W[nm];B[ll];W[kj];B[mo]C[Fancy jumps almost never at your rank I would avoid them. There is almost always a problem and you don't even have to be all that skilled to take advantage of a mistake like this.]

(;W[ol];B[mm];W[ok];B[lk];W[ki];B[kg];W[mq]C[niallp [4k\]: wondered a lot here..decided to try to take eye shape from w, but actually helped make it?!
Teachers comments:
I mentioned this move right away because its value is so great now he has just dug the diamond out of the ground.]

(;B[jr]C[niallp [4k\]: shoudl probably aim to keep w small, but couldn't see a way to block w from pushing into middle
Teachers comments:
Do not only think about aiming to keep white small but aim t attack n11 those are weak stones and gain territory on the way then later l3 will be weak.]
;W[kr];B[ir];W[lp];B[lr];W[mr];B[kq];W[kp];B[ks];W[or]C[After this game becomes hard because n5 so weak.]

(;B[cj];W[el]
(;B[nn]C[niallp [4k\]: was worried about this group? but maybe better to enclose my main territory?
Teachers comments:
When you are this far behind you need to take a few big risk.]
;W[ei];B[ej];W[gi]
(;B[fj];W[fi];B[ii];W[gj];B[gk];W[ij];B[hj]C[niallp [4k\]: big fight to keep b territory. was it over possesive? is there a better way?
Teachers comments:
This is another example of greed you can not make up a lose in one move try to make little gains until you have many enough of them to win. 5 points 4 times is 20 points that is a huge difference.]
