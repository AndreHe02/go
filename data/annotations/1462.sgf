C[I'm Rubus and playing Black. I'm 18k and Oxygen 17k on NNGS. I'm not used to play without handicap. Where should I start to play?

*thinking* Well... 4-4 point maybe   :o)

-------------------------------

Dear Karel,

I had a look at your review and made some remarks. You did a good job. At some places,
I felt that what I am doing is more a review of the game than a review of the review;
for example I commented on quite a few bad moves that you decided not to mention.
I hope that you still find my remarks useful.   While the alternative moves you suggested in the variations were mostly very good,
you sometimes assumed inferior play by one side in the continuation (maybe that was for
demonstration purposes, to show that your suggestion is really better than the game  move).

Since you gave a lot of variations in your review, I deleted most of those variations
that I did not comment on (because I basically agreed to them, at least to the first
several moves). I hope that will make it easier to find my comments.

Best regards,

Ulrich
ug 2k* (IGS)];B[pd]C[vlkplk: For first move of ("live") game, it's polite to play at white's left hand part of board. That is, somwhere inside the K10, K19, T19 triangle. However, it's supposed to be rude to place first stone directly at K10 (tengen).

ug: As far as I know, the "polite" part is the K10, T19, T10 triangle. The main point is
that it would be "impolite" to play the first move in white's right hand corner. I don't think
it's supposed to be rude to play on tengen as the first move. Actually that happens
in professional games, sometimes, although it is not very popular nowadays.]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[pp]C[Here I was thinking if I should secure my corner or attack white's corner. I choose to secure on my base.

vlkplk: Almost anything is good. It's matter of taste. My favorite is K16, which makes strong position. Non-conservative move would be at K10.]
;B[fc]C[vlkplk: This move is usualy played as response for whites attack at C14. I don't know about josekis so much, but I doubt its useful. The reason is that it does not secure corner - consider white's move at C16. But maybe even it's not a large scale move, it's alright. See some book about joseki (but I didn't find this move among basic josekis).

ug: Let me try to give another explanation. The 4-4 stone goes for influence; it is not
giving you territory. Thus the followup at F17 which tries to make a corner enclosure
is somehow inconsistent with the D16 stone. If black would like to have a corner enclosure,
he should start with a 3-4 (or even 3-3) point in the corner. If he likes to go
for influence, then 4-4 is good, but he should play a follow-up move
that fits this strategy. For example K10 or D10. Of course, an approach move, at C6 say,
is also a good option.]
(;W[cf]C[vlkplk: To respond for this white's move, I would choose C16. It is a simple move, secures corner, Doesn't leave any room for white to do something later in corner and leaves white to decide what to do to help his stone at C14. See variations .]

(;B[ce]C[vlkplk: Instead of this move, see previous variations. This moves is played usualy when black has no stone at F17. When you play contact move like this, inspite of makeing yourself strong, you help oponnent to strengthten him self as well.]
;W[be]C[vlkplk: Now black can switch like in variation. Don't allow white to take initiative.

ug: First of all, white B15 is not a good move. I think white should play at D14 instead;
black could then pincer (around D11), and a fight would develop. This fight would of course
be favorable for black, which shows that white C14 probably was not a good idea.

Now, as to blacks answer, I think that either B16 or D14 is ok (I think I would have played
at B16.) It depends somehow on blacks strategy: B16 secures territory, D14 builds a wall
and gains much influence. That is not bad, but maybe somewhat inconsistent with
the stone at F17.]
(;B[bd];W[ae]C[ug: Very bad. Unless it is completely inevitable, don't play on the first line
in the first 100 moves of the game :). Here, B13 is much better.]
;B[ad]C[ug: Same comment as for A15 applies. At this early stage, it is not important
to defend the corner. Playing at D14 instead would be great for black.]
;W[bg];B[df];W[dg]
(;B[ef]C[vlkplk: Seems you fall a bit under white's intention - see previous variation.]
;W[eg]C[vlkplk: See variation !

ug: I agree. F13 is the vital point now.]
(;B[nc];W[qf]C[ug: Again, white plays an approach against blacks shimari.  D7, F13, or K4 look more attractive.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[se];B[sd];W[rg];B[pf];W[pg]C[vlkplk: Same as before ... Maybe even more urgent.]

(;B[of];W[og]C[Not so pleased with the result. It looks hard on the bottom. So I try to attack...

vlkplk: In both upper shapes there is serious weakness. If white gets to haneh there on head of two black stones, it's generaly considered to be bad for black (as you see later). You should go ahead a little bit as in variation.]

(;B[cn]C[vlkplk: I don't like this kind of moves. It allows to white to push you against his strength, where you are not going to have chance of making any damage. Considering symetry, maybe move at K3 or K4 would be good.]
;W[dn]C[This surprised me...

vlkplk: It's right move, I think.

ug: I don't like this move for white. Just D7 now should be good enough for black;
see the variation. I would recommend C8 instead for white.]

(;B[cp]C[vlkplk: Apropriate response.

ug: This looks like a very strange move to me, and I don't see what would  be wrong with the usual black D7.]
;W[gp]C[vlkplk: Now descending is good, I think. The reason is: safety for black group and later may come in hand on lower side. Don't make so strict moves as next one so often.

ug: White should have played C5. After black B5, white connects, and gets some kind of
wall, whereas black has two cutting points. The four stones in the lower left corner
form a very unstable shape - whoever plays first, will get an advantage. Thus
C5 is the only move for white, I think.]
(;B[dq]C[ug: For the same reasons, now black should black should play at D5.]
;W[eq]C[ug: Still, C5 seems better.];B[dr]C[vlkplk: Maybe white had to play D5 first.]

(;W[er];B[do]C[ug: finally ...];W[ep];B[dm];W[en];B[em]C[ug: Since black's groups is alive, even with quite some territory, black should switch to  a big point. Something like O3 looks good. Compare the situation now to the situation
when black finally played at R6; white was much stronger then.]
;W[eo];B[co]C[vlkplk: This sequence, even black has made some damage on right side, ends in blacks got eh. This is VERY important now. White has free hands to: secure his right side/central territory or make moves at F14 or O14. But one thing should be prized: this sequence makes white stone at F4 almost useless. In situation when black has already made something on right/lower side, this sequence would be advantage for black, I think.

ug: I agree that black should have taken sente instead of E7.]
;W[fm]C[Looks good there... But how do I get through white's wall?

vlkplk: Yours next move is right. Then try something inside whites moyo (but this is question what exactly). See variations.]

(;B[fl]C[vlkplk: Good move. Black tries to diminish whites moyo making use of his strong position on left side.]
;W[el]C[vlkplk: Natural move.];B[gm]C[vlkplk: Good.];W[fn];B[dl]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[dj]C[vlkplk: Now consider weakness of black three stones. See variation .]

(;B[dk]C[ug: This is bad, since it doesn't help black at all. For one thing, it hurts the center
stones, and it also leaves the D8 stones in a shortage or liberties.]
;W[ej]C[Feels like a problem. What do I do with my stones on the outside?

vlkplk: Now black has better to abandone these stones. And hope they will come in use later. If you really want to protect them, then you have to spend one move and play something like in variations .]

(;B[cj]C[vlkplk: How much gives you moves like this ?];W[ci]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[fj];W[ck]C[Hmmm... I felt secure...

vlkplk: Actualy, black seems secure. See variation. What is important, he wants to use moves like E11 or F11 and try to connect...]

(;B[cl];W[bk];B[bl];W[aj]C[vlkplk: Now black central group has hard life.]
;B[al]C[vlkplk: No use move !];W[es]C[ug: Much to small at this time. Black should ignore this.]
;B[ds]C[vlkplk: No use to defend here. Black has not so many points to lose and lives sure anyway.

ug: Agree.];W[gi];B[fh]C[I try to connect...

vlkplk: It's too late. During play You should give careful look at how many weak groups there are on the board. The one who has more weak groups is usualy in great disadvantage (here black has one, while whites all groups are safe.]
;W[fi];B[fg];W[eh];B[ng];W[nh]
(;B[mg]C[vlkplk: It is right move now. Variations shown before makes white strength to help his corner too much. After this, white corner is more open, so GOOD !]
;W[mh]C[vlkplk: See variations . I think the one starting with black M12 (or M13) is best.]

(;B[qn]C[vlkplk: If black can manage this stone to live and destroy enough territory of white...

BUT ! Blacks upper territory, which seems big, needs at least one more move to secure (M12 or M13). So do this move and than invade is BEST.]
;W[pn]C[vlkplk: Now, black central group cannot be rescued.]
;B[qp]C[ug: see above];W[po];B[pq]C[Mistake... Guess I should play R5.

vlkplk: Maybe a mistake.

ug: agree, R5 is the only move.];W[qo];B[ro];W[rp]C[vlkplk: Black must connect.]

(;B[gj]C[vlkplk: What can you do here ?];W[gh];B[gg];W[hk]C[Doomed... or?

vlkplk: Yes.];B[nq]C[vlkplk: Connect instead ?];W[qq]C[vlkplk: Even if black descend, it's hard.]

vlkplk: Maybe not mistake.];B[or];W[pr];B[op];W[pq];B[os]C[vlkplk: I don't like this move. See previous variations.

white groups, so they will have no chance to live. I think white can just play K11 instead.
