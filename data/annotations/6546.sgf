C[Hello! I am Bernd Sambale, German 4k playing since 
September 2007, HonFu, 2k, on KGS and here in the 
ladder.
I have reached one of those points where every of my 
moves feels ambiguous to me: Is it nonsense or brilliant? 
(My last move certainly was not brilliant.) I would like you 
to evaluate my decisions and to put them into a strategical 
context, which of course I try but don't know how well I 
could actually do it. Since a while I'm on the brink of KGS 
1k, but I play bad recently. Maybe you can help me bring 
back order into my game?
Thank you very much!
Hello! You truly played an interesting game :) I hope this 
review helps you.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[co];B[fc];W[df];B[kc]

variation with a more dynamic move.];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn]
CR[co]TR[nr][mp]LB[dq:A][ip:B]C[H.: Was my opening okay so far or did I fall behind? I'm 
really not sure how to judge it and would be happy about 
some principles.
Your opening was pretty good, but a thing both 
less-experienced players tend to do is play joseki not quite 
in conjunction with each other. These last few moves not 
only created a group with too small of a base, but also do 
not form a great relationship with the marked stone.
I think the only reason this joseki turned out so badly for 
you was because of the trade of the triangle-marked 
stones.
You had to defend the cut, but you also need to play at A 
or B.];B[od]C[H.: This shimari seems to try to raise the value of R9. I feel 
it is too close to my thickness and too far from the upper 
corner, but if I want to prove it, I feel like having to invade 
now. Was this correct or should I have played differently? 
Because ... well, I had a feeling of just barely getting away 
in the ensuing fight ...]
(;W[qh]LB[qi:A]C[Your idea was right, but I think the fight was so hard for 
you because your invasion was too close to black's 
group; A seems better.
I included a few variations to show that an invasion A 
seems best.];B[pi];W[ph];B[oh];W[og];B[oi];W[pf]LB[ng:A]C[This cannot be played; A must be. Either way, white will 
have trouble profiting.

white's influence near the center.];B[ng];W[nf];B[mf];W[mg]

(;W[cd]LB[dc:A]C[You must block at A; otherwise, you'll allow black to 
attack your large group even more.];B[dc];W[fd];B[ed]C[Odd move; its aji-keshi.]
;W[ee];B[ec];W[he]LB[gc:A]C[H.: So I am free. But what is my actual profit? I was able 
to split the top and keep it confined, alright, and if I could 
miraculously get some stones into the center, I even might 
pull out N13, but if black strengthens there right now, I'm 
not sure what all my thickness will be good for.
From this fight you profited little other than a living group. 
Also, you had the right idea again connecting, but A 
would be better.];B[cq];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[fq];W[gp];B[dk]
C[H.: So he wants to keep me to nothing. If I ever get a 
chance to attack, it's now. I try to do it in a way which 
separates the upper right center from D9.];W[di];B[fk];W[gi]
C[Very good strategy!];B[fn]
(;W[dp];B[gq];W[dq];B[dr];W[hq];B[hr];W[iq];B[ir];W[jq];B[ho]
C[H.: Here I thought: Why connect passively, if I can finally 
take some profit? But ... well, this cut will break my neck 
later. Actually what does that is a bad move following a bit 
after that cut, but it all seemed to start here, him getting 
his weak stones spread ...];W[er]C[Good!];B[fr];W[cr];B[es]
;W[bq];B[hj];W[hi];B[ij];W[ii];B[ji]
(;W[jj]C[H.: Here I felt grateful.
You're right in assuming that you need to seperate 
his group, but you can't expect to win a direct fight in his 
sphere of influence. Instead, you need to push to create 
weaknesses. I included one example for the first move, 
and a few subvariations.];B[ki];W[jk];B[jm]C[H.: But now the feeling already vanished, because I saw, 
that my stones first had to get away, and blacks weak 
stones would strengthen on their account. There is that 
weakness around G9, but I saw no way of exploiting it 
without helping him.]
(;W[kl]LB[lk:A]C[Much too slow, at least a one-space jump at A is 
necessary at A.];B[ln];W[ml];B[nm];W[mm];B[mn];W[nn];B[nl];W[nk]
;B[ok]C[At this point, your idea of G9 would probably be good 
since there's really nothing for black to gain now from it, 
or perhaps something risky. It's always fun to experiment!]

empty triangle cannot be good for white.];B[fm]C[H.: I just barely got away myself. At least he is cut off and 
still without eyes. And now I wished I had connected 
back then ... I could of course connect now or cut at L5, 
but I felt that black would then just build around the lonely 
E8 stone and live.];W[dm];B[fl];W[ci];B[fi];W[ej];B[fh];W[hg]

;B[lp];W[lq];B[jp]C[H.: Okay, here I could have finally connected. But then I 
thought he might exploit the still flimsy shape around E8 
and get a second eye there after taking L4. That would 
have been my defeat, since I'm behind on actual territory.]

(;W[ip];B[om]C[H.: Okay, so here I made my final blunder. But somehow 
the whole fight was hard for me, and I wonder what I 
could have done better. Please adjust my strategy, and I 
would also be grateful for some recommendations of what 
and how to study or what to read.
Again, thanks for your time and your help!
First of all, I'd like to say it is absolutely amazing that 
someone who started just 6 months ago could progress so 
much so quickly!
Also, as you read through my review, I point out several 
mistakes you made. Honestly, I would not dream of seeing 
any kyu player spotting some of the more complex 
variations. I am just trying to help you keep an eye out for 
tesujis (and mine too :) ).
Over all, you play was very good, and the few large 
blunders you made really cost you.
I think, to improve your game, you just need to work more 
on improving your fuseki and getting better at fighting. If 
you can afford it, I truly recommend Get Strong at the 
Opening and Get Strong at Attacking by Richard 
Bozulich. If not, whenever you want, perhaps go to 
goproblems.com, whih contains over 5000 go problems 
over all difficulties and varities.
Finally, I'd like to say it was a lot of fun being able to 
review this game and good luck with your future games!])
