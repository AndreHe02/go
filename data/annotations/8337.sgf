LB[qd:A]C[  Hello, this is a game between me and my friend. I'm takin black.
  I'd like this game to be commented mostly on the fuseki and middle game. You can find my questions and thought here thought out the game.
  Thanks a lot for your time!


Normally for the first move, if you want to play komoku it should be at A.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[qe];W[pj]LB[fc:A][ed:B]C[White to approach the corner at A or B better.]
;B[dj];W[ic];B[ec]C[I think this exchange was good for black.

Yes, I agree.]
(;W[mc]LB[kc:A]C[Not very strong between two shimaris.

Black can always invade at A, this is no good for white.];B[nq]
LB[op:A]C[I enclosed far thinking a pincer would work fine with the q10 stone, but maybe o4 would be better for me.

Nevertheless, this is good move.

Alternatively, you can play A also.];W[op];B[np];W[oo];B[pr]
LB[qr:A]C[White A is huge.];W[no]LB[qq:A][rp:B]C[Black should exchange A with B early.]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[ln];B[ko];W[gq]LB[qq:A][rp:B]C[Another chance to exchange A with B.]
;B[qh]LB[qq:A][rp:B]C[Good move, even better if you exchange A with B first.]
;W[qi];B[ph]LB[ni:A]C[White A would be better.];W[cm]LB[cq:A]
[qq:B][rp:C][oj:D]C[I don't think this is good for white, 3 moves and corner is still open.

Yes, black can always invade at A.

In this position, black should exchange A with B then play D.]
;B[oj];W[ok];B[oi]LB[nk:A][bj:B]C[White A is huge.]
(;W[bj]LB[pk:A]C[Black should cut at A.];B[dg]C[Rather a slow move by black.]
;W[bg]LB[bk:A][di:B][pk:C]C[Black can play A to cut off B13, so for white playing B (locally so to speak) would be better than B13.]
;B[kc]LB[pk:A]C[That attack didn't go as i'd like to, i did get some territory but he made good shape.

Black should have cut at A.];W[kd]LB[jd:A]C[Black A better.]
(;B[ld];W[lc];B[jd];W[ke];B[jc];W[me];B[id]SQ[oj][oi][ph]C[Actually this result is also good for black.

The only regret is the influence by the marked stones is somehow neutralized.]
;W[dq]LB[pk:A]C[Black should cut at A now.];B[cg];W[bh]LB[pk:A]
C[Still good to cut at A now.];B[iq]LB[qq:A][rp:B][nk:C]C[Again, you missed the A/B exchange.

In this position white playing R2 is way too big.

White should play C for now.];W[jp]C[Can't really say anything on this one.]
(;B[ip];W[jo]LB[kr:A]C[Black A is the correct shape here.];B[kq]
;W[kp];B[lq]
(;W[jq]C[This push is bad move or thank you move... 
White could have played K2 later...];B[jr];W[kn];B[gp]LB[fq:A]
C[White A better.];W[fp];B[jn];W[in];B[jm];W[io];B[ho]LB[im:A]
C[White A better.];W[gn];B[hn];W[im]LB[jl:A]C[Black should play A unconditionally, you cannot sacrifice cutting stone that easily.]
;B[hm];W[jl]C[Black misread here?];B[nk]LB[pk:A]C[Actually white should play A for better aji.]
;W[ol];B[km]LB[pk:A][qk:B]C[Black should have cut at A first, a probing move. 

If white wrongly responded at B then black escape at L7...]
;W[kl];B[lm];W[mm];B[pk]TR[km][lm]SQ[mm][kl]C[Good timing...

But the two moves exchanged lose some influence...];W[pl];B[qk]
;W[ql];B[rk];W[rl];B[ri];W[sk];B[rj];W[gm]LB[jf:A]C[Bad move by white, it is not urgent or big at all...

White should consider playing A or somewhere around this area to restrict the development of the top left.]
;B[jf]C[Good move by black.];W[hl]
(;B[hr]SQ[hm][hn][ho][gp]C[Slow move, actually black can tenuki.

H2 only mean to save the 4 stones in gote.];W[go]C[H4 is gote 8 points... Should have tenuki.]
;B[hp];W[gg];B[gi]C[This was the best i was able to come up with, wasn't satisfied though.

Good move.];W[eh]LB[ci:A]C[Black E13 is helping move... 

Black should play A here.];B[eg];W[fh];B[ci];W[ej]SQ[fh]C[As you can see white can't play E10 without having F12.]
;B[ek];W[fj]

;B[mj]LB[oe:A]C[White should play A.];W[lk]C[Capturing 4 stones is only 8 points.]
