;W[qo];B[oo];W[pn];B[jp];W[on];B[mo];W[nn]C[<Svante> This result is good for White.]
;B[qe]C[I played R15 to prevent White from taking the whole right side.

<Svante> Good move.];W[kc];B[dj];W[nc];B[qh]C[I had to choose from R12 and C3 or C4. I played R12 because I didn't want White to seal me in the corner with R13.
Anyway, I'm not so sure about this move.

<Svante> C3 or C4 is certainly smaller than the upper left corner.  R12 is a good move to avoid getting cramped.  There may also be some opportunity to exploit the aji at R7 in the future (not now).]
(;W[cq]C[<Svante> I think that C16 would be bigger here.]
(;B[cp]C[<Svante> I would block the other side, because the left side is too unclear.]

(;B[cd]C[<Svante> I would like the 3-3 invasion better, here, because the top side is wider than the left.  Black does not want C16 and D10 to compete for space.]
(;W[ce]C[<Svante> I think that I would rather attach on the inside.]
(;B[dd]C[<Svante> Bad shape.  Black is butting his head into the hane.]
;W[de];B[ec];W[fc]C[<Svante> Good move by White.  It shows the bad black shape.]
;B[fd];W[ee];B[fb];W[gc];B[db];W[gb]
(;B[bd]C[Should I play elsewhere (something like F11)?

<Svante> I like N6 better, but this descent is also quite big (see variation).]
;W[bj]C[If I play C9, White can play F12 and make a big territory.

<Svante> That would not be big.  See variation.  C9 does not look big either now.]
(;B[eh];W[mp]C[<Svante> This is big.];B[mq];W[lp];B[lq];W[oq]
;B[nq];W[kp];B[kq];W[ln];B[jo];W[kn];B[jm]C[<Svante> This kind of bad shape almost always comes back to haunt you.  Even now, it is unclear what Black intends to do when White just cuts through the peep Black has setup himself in.]
;W[dk]C[There are too many ways to respond to White's invasion.  I'm sure I chose the worst one.  :(]
(;B[cj]C[<Svante> Black is running into a hane again.  Even if White responded in the way Black seems to hope, it is not easy for Black (see variation to the next move).]
(;W[bk];B[ck];W[cl]
(;B[dl]C[<Svante> One can see what is coming.  I think that Black can maintain some integrity by sacrificing a stone at B8, however (see variation).]
;W[dm];B[bl];W[el];B[bm]C[<Svante> Now White has better shape than if Black had first played B8, then D8.]

;W[dl];B[hi];W[ik];B[hj]C[<Svante> Bad move.  Do not push when you cannot cut.]
;W[hk];B[ff]C[<Svante> Not needed, not useful, and most likely aji keshi.  There are other ways that this shape could be used against White later.]
;W[fe];B[if];W[jn];B[in];W[im];B[md];W[mc]
(;B[ld]C[<Svante> I think that L16 would be better here (see variation).]
;W[kd];B[ke];W[je];B[jf];W[kf];B[le];W[ie];B[kg]C[What about M12 or M13?

<Svante> Why?  This captures the stone.];W[lf]C[<Svante> Mistake by White.  L14 cannot escape.]
(;B[nd]C[<Svante> Capturing is surely better (see variation).]
;W[lg];B[kh];W[lh];B[ki];W[li];B[kk];W[jl]
(;B[kl]C[<Svante> What is the purpose of this move?  All it does is destroy aji.]
;W[km];B[lj];W[ni];B[mj];W[oj];B[mi];W[ng];B[mh];W[od]C[<Svante> When Black captures the five white stones, his group in the centre is completely safe, which makes a big difference in the endgame.  However, White can push and cut into the corner (see variation to next move), which is also quite big.]
(;B[oc]C[<Svante> One obvious alternative would be to directly capture the five stones in the centre, but that would give White opportunity to get a lot in the corner (see first variation).  Black could also think about resisting with P15 (see second variation).]

;B[bf]C[<Svante> Now that Black has created an eye around M9, this move becomes possible.]

[jq][hr][ir][jr][kr][lr][mr][hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms]C[<Svante>  I think that the main mistakes by Black were the dubious sequence in the lower right, the wrong direction of blocking the 3-3 invasion on the lower left, and the tendency to play forcing moves without value, which mostly turn out as aji keshi (F14, L8).  White should pay more attention not to try to save hopeless stones (M14, A13).]
