C[This game was played on KGS, between HonFu (5k) vs. diemorph (4k).

I, HonFu, spent most of the game time with playing against my opponent's lead, so I guess the main problem is one concerning opening strategy.


Actually your opening was fine, though a little overconcentrated on making your own nice shape without paying enough attention to maximizing your effectiveness by taking good shape making points that are big for both of you.  

The problem was how often you let him take stones that you were supposedly using to attack him with.  You need to fight harder, and more solidly during your invasions -- you give up too easily.  You need to look harder for strong moves that take advantage of flexibility (threaten to live with an invading group instead of only thinking about connecting to another living group, for example).  But of course watch out for overplays, like in the bottom left.   More flexible fighting will help you make better use of your good shape instincts.  Hope this helps.]

;W[qd];B[rf];W[hk]C[While attacking me there, he can build a big framework above. But if I hadnt invaded at D4, that framework could have become too large, so I don't know what I should or could have done better or different. What was the proper direction of play in this opening?]

;W[jp];B[io];W[jq];B[lo];W[qo]C[Now he invades. That was probable, wasn't it? And it's also probable that he will either live or get away. I will start an attack building up some center strength starting a counter invasion. But it won't be sufficient to bring me closer to him that about 10 points, which was the final lead of him. Now that I think of it, maybe instead extending from the weak L3, I should have strenghtened my moyo with for example something like P5 to prevent that invasion in the first place? But from there on what would have been my strategy?


This is a good game for black; you should be happy that he invaded first, giving you the advantage.  His top is more open than your bottom and right side; you just didn't invade/reduce well enough.]

NO, not too late, b is fine.  I would invade on line 17, since w is wide open and all his stones are fourth line.]

b12 better; you can cut into his territory if he takes the stone.]
