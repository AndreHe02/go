C[Olof: Hi hope you will enjoy my review.

This was a game I [echowhisky [23k\]\] played against rebphoton [22k\] on kgs recently. I have a few comments added to tell you what I thought when I was playing...]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qk]TR[fc][oc][jd][od][cj][pj][qj]
[ep][fp][jp][eq][fq]C[echowhisky: Is R9 not a good move? I also considered P16, F17 and C10.

Olof: P16, P17, F17, C10, K4, K16 etc. all good moves.
If you want to play in this area (which is also good) Q10 and R10 are the most balanced moves.]
;W[hc]C[echowhisky: Here I thought perhaps C13?

Olof: C13 doesn't look that good to me. K4 as you played is better.]
;B[jp];W[gq];B[dj]TR[ch][cl]C[Olof: Perhaps better to play on the third line. But it depends on your taste. If you play on the fourth line it can become hard to create a lving group on the side and you will have to connect out instead. White should play C8 or C12 now.]
;W[oc];B[lc];W[qf]LB[od:C][pe:A][pf:B]C[echowhisky: didn't know what to do here...never had a pincer played on a pincer before...white got the better exchange...tried to take corner but didn't work.

Olof: P16 as you played is joseki but not the most usual one.
Q14 and Q15 are the normal joseki move. Se var.

Often if you want to attack a stone you start by leaning on another stone. Here you lean against P16 so target must be R14, if you instead lean agains R14 with Q14 or Q15 P17 becomes your target instead.]

(;B[od];W[pc];B[pd];W[qc]LB[nd:B][re:A]
(;B[re]C[echowhisky: perhaps B-Q14 better?

Olof: The joseki move is O16
se var];W[qh]LB[me:B][qq:A]
(;B[qq]TR[me]C[echowhisky: R-3 small?

Olof: It's big but there is an important proverb that cover this situation. "Urgent moves before big moves".

You have to identify which of your groups are weak and which of his are weak.
Currently your stones on the top are weak and his two stones on the right. The hard thing is to find the correct move here, I think I would have played N15 it's a shape move that links the three stones to the right with M17 and at the same time threatens to attack the two white stones, but there are other good moves here.

Se a var of that could happen if he ignores it.];W[ke];B[me]
C[Olof: Good];W[ld];B[md];W[lg]LB[mh:B][ho:C][mp:A]
(;B[mp]C[Olof: Again you leave your weak group.
I would play P13 or O13 this attacks the two white stones on the left and makes it easier to connect out. Or perhaps lean against M13 with N12 first. There is a ladder to consider if you play N12 sa perhaps a ladder blocker first at H15.]
;W[nc]C[echowhisky: better to connect at N17?

Yes, always try to stay connected, and keep your opponent cut.]
;B[nd];W[mc];B[ng]C[Olof: good];W[oh];B[pg]C[echowhisky: N12 better?

Olof: yes.];W[og];B[nf];W[pf];B[nh];W[oj];B[ol]TR[lh][jq][jr]
C[Olof: this move again abandons your weak group. It it also over concentratet and on the wrong line. If you want to defend this area K3 or K2 are the only moves. Othervice white kan slide under with K2 and destory alot of terr, if he does N4 is useless.

But you really want to play a move like M12 here.];W[mj];B[ni]
;W[nj];B[oi];W[pi];B[of];W[ph];B[lh];W[li];B[cm]C[Olof: And again. It's a wonder you manage to live there.]
;W[kh];B[cg]C[Olof: I would play this at D14 or E14 instead, this is not effective here.]
;W[gn];B[pj]C[Olof: Cutting is good.];W[qj];B[pk];W[rj];B[rg]
;W[qg];B[ri];W[rh];B[rk];W[si];B[sg];W[mf]C[Olof: Bad white move. Only helps black, better at M14 or S17.]
;B[le];W[kd];B[lf]C[Olof: Here white needs to play L14 to keep you from sneaking out. The N14 stone is uninteresting,]
;W[mg];B[kf];W[mh];B[jf];W[kc]C[Olof: Unnecessary.];B[oe];W[qe]
;B[sh];W[qi];B[rf];W[sj];B[rc];W[rb];B[sd]TR[rd]C[Olof: S16 is better, you leave no ko threats with that.]
;W[gf];B[ik]TR[cc][cd][lm][ep][ir]C[Olof: What is the purpose of this move? You can't attack the stones up to the right, they are already thick.  I think C16 is good here, big. Think "Corners, sides, center" in that order.

Other interesting areas are marked.];W[ml];B[nn];W[nm];B[om]
;W[mo];B[mm];W[nl];B[lo]TR[mn]C[Olof: N6 is only move here.]
;W[no];B[oo];W[mn];B[np];W[on];B[ln];W[lm];B[pn];W[nn];B[lk]
C[Olof: Proverb: "Do not peek at the bambujoint. This white group is already alive. Nothing can be gained by attacking it. More provervbs: "Play away from thickness".]
;W[kk];B[jn];W[kl];B[im]C[Olof: does nothing, If you want to connect J9 then G9 is a better move.]
;W[gl];B[gj];W[il];B[jl];W[hl];B[hj];W[jk];B[gh];W[jm];B[in]
C[echowhisky: I was looking for a chance to attack E4 area, but none came...any big moves?

Olof: E4 is good, B4 also works. You can't always destory an area but you can reduce it.]
;W[hk];B[ij];W[iq];B[jq];W[jr];B[kr];W[is]C[Olof: Now you have sente to reduce around C4,
L1 is not urgent.];B[ks];W[ip];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[jo];B[ko]
;W[kn];B[km];W[sc];B[rd];W[kn];B[eo];W[km]C[echowhisky: misread here....

Olof: No it's ok so far no good ko threats and this saves your 5 stones.]
;B[go];W[kp]LB[lp:1][kq:2][lq:3][lr:5][js:4]C[echowhisky: what is best response?

Olof: M4 and then M3];B[lq];W[lp];B[kq];W[fp];B[fn];W[gm];B[fo]
;W[do];B[dn];W[mq]LB[nq:A][mr:B]C[echowhisky: again i made a mistake]

(;B[nq]C[echowhisky: perhaps B-N2 better?

Olof: Maybe, se var for possible outcome.];W[mr];B[ms]TR[nr]
C[Olof: O2];W[ns]LB[nr:B][ls:A]
(;B[ls]TR[nr]C[Olof: O2 again];W[js];B[nr];W[lr];B[os];W[ls]
LB[or:A]C[echowhisky: P2 necessary?

Olof: no not untill white plays N1 Ser var.

White should have played N1 instead.]
(;B[or];W[eg];B[cc]LB[dc:B][cd:A]C[echowhisky: don't know, but the time looked right for an invasion

Olof: It's good, C16 is also ok.

But perhaps you should play out the reducning moves in the lower left first before white plays E4. Start with D4]

(;W[cd]C[Olof: Bad response by white, block on the wide side. Se vars]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb]LB[fb:B][fc:A]
(;W[fc]C[Olof: Perhaps better with dubble hane by white here.]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[bd];W[be];B[ac]TR[bc]C[Olof: Should be at B17, now white has a peek a B18. Black could die.]

C[Olof: Now white got a huge corner. I think this (and the weak group in the upper right) the the main reason you lost the game.]

;W[ce];B[ae];W[jh];B[ig]C[echowhisky: was this move was unecessary? (I would have played E16 here but I decided to be safe)

Olof: Yes but you got to play it anyway so.
If white plays here you just play H13.];W[ji];B[ed];W[ee];B[de]
LB[fd:B][sk:A]
(;W[fd];B[sk]C[echowhisky: didn't notice T9 until now...I think major error?

C[echowhisky: hmm i think I could have 'squeezed' a few points from the ko at T19? but I don't see any big ko threats...

Olof: he didn't have any either and you only need threat that are worth 1 point becuse that is the value of the ko. But it made no difference to who won or lost the game. There is also a ko worth 1 point at N1.

Two things you need to think about.
1. Identify weak groups, both yours and his and secure/attack there first.
2. There are no points in the center, focus more on the sides and corners.
