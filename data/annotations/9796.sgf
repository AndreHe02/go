C[mtan52 [5k\]: Hi gg

[dg\] Hi Dirk. I hope my comments are helpful to you.

Overall I think you played well and the match was quite even. I didn't find many specific tactical mistakes, but I did find a few spots where I thought you made general strategic mistakes or violated some ancient go proverbs. I tried to point these out.

I used to be 1d, but haven't played much recently so I am probably 1-2k.  (so please take my comments with a grain of salt!)

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions at dave@karmatribe.com

Thanks,

[dg\] Black has made a mistake, and I think you should capitalize by taking D16, which is a key point in black's shape, and also a key point for the corner.]

[dg\] Seems that this joseki was good for black because white's triangle stone is too close to strength and would look at better at D6/C6 or so.

F15 seems too slow. I would prefer to play at C6 right now.

Also, if you want to play in this area, I think A is better because it's faster.]
;B[ff];W[eg];B[ef];W[gh]LB[ef:2][eg:1][gh:3]C[[
dg\] I'm not sure that this sequence was good for you. Blacks C15 group is already strong and has a good shape.  You should "play away from strength".  Now you have made a weak heavy group and are forced to run.  Black will be able to make territory in bottom left as he pressures you.  Instead of G12, you could consider a move in the bottom left to treat these stones flexibly and lightly.

Also, it is unclear what the kikashi of E13 for E14 accomplishes.  Normally this is a move to make the other guy's group heavy and have bad shape. But in this case, black has ample eye space and so you are just making yourself heavy, in my opinion]
;B[ch];W[ci];B[bh];W[ei];B[kc];W[nc];B[hc];W[id]LB[qn:A][do:B]
SQ[ff]C[
[dg\]: This move also has an unclear objective. You aren't currently strong enough in the area to attack this black group, and it is unclear what benefit you will get from making a wall over top of the black stones, since black has the protruding "square" stone which diminishes the potential influence of your wall.  I would play elsewhere now (like A or B), and try to attack this group later in the game]
;B[ic];W[jd];B[lb];W[ld];B[gf];W[jb]C[
[dg\]: It is too early to attack this group, since your surrounding stones has lots of weaknesses]

[dg\] i would just play L18 now to leave black with a really awkward group]

[dg\]: black made some mistakes and this is a good result for you.  good move. this move could also be at Q6.

If it is at Q6, then it is in a slightly better position to threaten the corner if black choses to invade your area. but not a huge deal.]
;B[qn];W[qm];B[qh]
(;W[pi]C[
[dg\]: It is rarely a good idea to do a shoulder hit on a weak stone that you are trying to kill. When you touch a stone like this, you instantly strengthen it. I think it would be better to play at R10 and drive black towards your strength

In the ensuing battle, you play sharply and well, and you almost kill him, but it is very difficult to read a bunch of moves ahead and kill a group like this. That's why I think it would be better to play a bit more conservatively and content yourself with pressuring black from the outside without touching him immediately (unless you can read out the entire killing sequence)]

TR[jj]C[
[dg\] I just want to point out that although you were able to cleverly reduce black's r14 group to one eye, he successfully escaped out into open space, and it will be very difficult to kill, especially since groups A and B are not particularly strong themselves. This is why it is usually better to surround before going in for the kill.  (IE pressuring from the outside as opposed to going for the shoulder hit)]

The general proverbs that you should try to work on are:
"Play away from strength"
"Don't play any moves with unclear objectives"
"Don't try to attack when you are weak in the neighborhood. First build up strength and then attack weak groups later"
"Don't touch stones you are trying to kill"])
