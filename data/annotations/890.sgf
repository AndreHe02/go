C[The right and left sides are bigger than the top or bottom. I would probably play "e", but would have a hard time arguing with any of the other choices.]

(;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]TR[pf]MA[qg][qf]C[Since the marked stone is high, black wants to complete his position with a low stone at "b". But breaking up white's potential double-wing formation is also big, so I cannot argue with "a". If the marked black stone had been played low, say at one of the points "X", then black would not have to choose.]
;B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[bf];W[eg]C[Black 17 is a big move.]
;B[pj]MA[jq]TR[oq]C[White 18 would be better at "X". Now, black can slide from the marked stone all the way to diamond. White has already given black a lot of secure territory, but it is not clear that white's potential is much greater. Black would seem to be ahead at this point.]

C[White 26 is not joseki, and should be at "b", which has a better relationship to the marked stone, and leaves fewer defects in white's position. Also, "a" puts no pressure on black. White is confounding the joseki where black plays 25 at "X".]

(;W[dn]MA[lo]C[Black 27 seems to invite white "X", which looks like a better trade for white. If white is going to win this game, it is going to be in the center. Black 27 seems much smaller than "b", my preferred move here - "b" is BIG! White would then enlarge her center moyo, and black would have to invade or reduce. If black is uncomfortable with waiting for white to strengthen, invading/reducing now seems OK - "c" or "d" or "e" seem possible. A moyo-expanding move around "f" also seems reasonable.]

(;B[lq]C[White "a" is a contact move that strengthens black. This is almost always bad. White "b" is natural.]

(;W[kq]C[Jared: move 28 should be at M5.    janr:  > I know this is usual shape, but i felt it isnt sente (black only hase a

Jared:  If you want to defend the side, play K2 or K3.  These would be OK, and
leave no bad aji without strengtening black. After the sequence you play,
J3 is a weak spot.

Just because a move is not sente does not mean it is bad.

In fact, white 28 is a bad sente move. Also known as a "thank you move",
because black thanks white for it. White pretty much has to play 30, so
white ends in gote no matter what.

The move I suggested is a key pointnn on the boundary between competing
moyos. Almost any mid-game strategy book will have a more complete
elucidation of this concept.];B[lp];W[jn]C[A black play somewhere in the center seems reasonable here.]
;B[jj]MA[kh][kl]C[White 32 is an overplay. It serves no purpose. There is absolutely no way white is going to kill the black stone. In fact, black could conceivably pressure white "a" with a play near one of the "X" points. So white "a" is definitely a losing move. White is going to drive black towards white's only possible profit areas , and in the process create weak white groups that black can attack.

After black 31, the center is mostly profitless. So white should be looking at the CORNERS, then the SIDES, and only at last the CENTER. Consider, for example, white "b" and "c"

Jared: Bottom line: consider everything, then play the biggest move.]

(;W[lj];B[hj];W[kl]C[Black 35 creates an odd shape. "b" seems better.]

(;B[kh];W[lh]C[Black 37 should strike at "b" to destroy white's shape.]

(;B[kg];W[ki];B[ji];W[ih];B[jh]TR[lh][ki][lj][ih]C[Now black has an empty triangle. White has won the shape war. But overall, white has lost ground. The triangled stones seem mostly useless.]
;W[lg]C[Black should just keep going with "b". White's whole upper side will be destroyed.]

(;B[ig];W[hh];B[hg];W[fh];B[gg];W[gh]C[Black 49 seems risky. "b" seems the key point. If white gets to seal black in first, black may have to struggle. Black 49 seems intent on destroying white's territory. But black is ahead, so black should play more conservatively.]

(;B[hl];W[jf];B[kf];W[ke];B[ie];W[je];B[jg]TR[ie]C[White 56 cuts off a single (marked) black stone and is almost withtout value. "b" is URGENT. Both shoulds should immediately recognize this. This is a critical connection point. Even 25-kyus should see this.]

(;W[if]MA[lk]C[Black "b" is huge. Among other things, it threatens followup moves like "X".]

(;B[ge];W[gc]TR[lf]C[I refuse to make any more commets until triangle gets played.

Jared:  M14 splits apart a black group and connects two white groups. This is a
fundamental strategy. It builds a moyo on the top right hand side. It
forces black to live in the center without much territory, strengthening
white in the process. The damage to the left upper side has already been
done; wasting more gote moves at this stage is bad. White's new wall will
be useful for invading the right side. SO MUCH power is created by
connecting your groups, what else can I say...];B[hn];W[hp]
;B[fm];W[im];B[fk];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[bs];W[cb];B[bb];W[db]
;B[dm]TR[lf]C[OK, I can't stand it. "b" is huge - black must respond. And what ever happened to "c"? And if black can escape at triangle, then why cut off black at "a"? Is time running out? If so, you're playing with too fast time limits. IGS games are notorious for ridiculuosly fast time limits.]

(;W[cm];B[dl];W[ba];B[bh];W[bi]TR[cl][cm]C[Whit 76 is an overplay. Black exploits with "b". See variations.   Incidentally, do you notice how worthless the marked white stones are? White should not have cut.]

Jared:
Right. Black has to wait until 217 to play the ko. Sorry.];B[lf]
C[Since there is no way to kill the black center group, white should resign here. The rest of the game from here just solidifies the various territories.]
