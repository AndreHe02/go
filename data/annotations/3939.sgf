C[This was one of those games where I felt comfortable the whole game, only to find at the end I hadn't enough to win. I believe I made some trade-offs that seemed beneficial but perhaps were not.

I played black in this game. I am interested in any and all comments you may have.

Thank you very much for your review.

-Dave Felcan(FindYoda)

Jay: Will be happy to help.  This is an interesting game to examine and reflect.  Black had lead early on and gave away the lead in middle game in subtle ways.]
;B[po];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[jp];B[lq]C[I felt it was better to take the initiative and not let my shimari be compromised any further, rather than take one of the big points.]
;W[fq]
(;B[fp]C[Jay: This move appears to contradict the earlier move at M3.  W's F3 is initially too widely spaced with K4 and subject to split attack.  Yet, letting W settle easily here makes W happy.]
;W[gp];B[eq];W[fo];B[ep];W[gq]C[I felt this overconcentrated White]
;B[cn];W[kq]C[Jay: This result allows W to settle and has neutralized B's initiative.  B's M3 stone is not well positioned.  But, I don't see anything major here.]

(;B[qk]C[Further? R10? Even R11?

Jay: This move makes R11 a good point for W. "A good point for your opponent is a good point for you". In fact,  I would go R14 or K17, since the upper side is more urgent, and after W entered B's half, it's natural for W to enter W's.  Also, there is no battle on the right side. 
But, now B's M3 exchange with W K4 needs some attention too before it becomes useless.  A little balancing is needed here.]
;W[qi];B[ok]C[Jay: B is a bit slow.];W[lp];B[qg];W[oi];B[og]

(;W[pm]C[Overplay by white?

Jay: It is aggressive, but B has some weakness too around R4.]

(;B[om]C[Jay: This is  a bit too strong.  B should develop slow attack.]
;W[on];B[pn];W[ol];B[nm]
(;W[pl]C[Kay: This is a mistake by W.];B[pk];W[nl];B[nk];W[ml]
;B[ni];W[nh];B[oh];W[mi];B[nj];W[ng];B[of]C[Jay: Now, W is a bit fragmented now.]
;W[nd];B[lc];W[ld];B[mc];W[nc];B[nb];W[ob];B[md];W[mb];B[lb]
;W[na];B[hd]C[Jay: This sequence locally B lost some points in UR corner, but it appears to be a good sequence by making three O12 stones useless.]
;W[no]C[Jay: W's capturing the two B's stones are too close to the strong group in lower side, not worth that much.  At this point B is in control.]
;B[em]C[I was worried about white's moyo expanding upwards. Simply extending along the 4 th or 3rd line would have helped white expand by threatening such a framework.

This however, doesn't seem very proactive. Perhaps if c6 had been at d6 I could have gone in deeper....

Jay: W's moyo is not as big as it appears, since the two W walls are too close to each other. You successfully neutralized the upper side, now,  I would approach the remaining corner.]
;W[cj]C[And this is subject to this type of reduction. However I felt white was playing a little too close to my thickness so...

Jay: To my taste, W's playing at D11 would be better. W probably felt the pressure of earlier mistakes and a bit more aggressive now. Maybe, W is an aggressive player anyway, as demonstrated by invasion at Q7.]
;B[dg]C[I attacked.

Jay: Good.];W[gc]C[Jay: This W's move is strange and strays away from the battle field which is on the left.]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[fj];W[fk];B[dk];W[dj];B[dl]C[Jay: I would play C9 to reduce W's liberty, since the left side battle is more important.  You were worried too  much about the center.  Left side trading the center is a good for B.]
;W[dh]
(;B[eh]C[Jay: I would take away W's base on the left first.]
;W[ch];B[eg];W[bf];B[gk];W[fl];B[gl];W[fm]
(;B[gm]C[Jay: With this push B lost a valuable opportunity.  The peep at G6 is very useful.  Now, B ends up in gote.]
;W[gn];B[hi];W[bl]C[My execution here was poor. I think the D13 stone should have been lower to really sever white's group. While I did benefit, so did White, and I think the trade was even, if not even in white's favor.

Jay: C12 pincer to develop a tighter fight could be another game.]
;B[en];W[fn]
(;B[cc]C[Jay: Perhaps, D17 is a better point to invade. If W's B14 stone were at C13, san-san is correct.  Now, W has exchanged B8 with E6, the left group is no longer weak.]
;W[dc]
(;B[db]C[Jay: This has problem.];W[cd];B[eb]C[In retrospect this might have been a mistake, but I didn't see a combination that allowed Black to live in the corner.]
;W[cb];B[gd]C[Jay: This gives up the two stones at D18 and is costly.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[ed];B[fd];W[fb];B[hc];W[ea];B[gb]C[This secured to top center for me in sente so despite the loss of stones, I thought it a good deal.]
;W[da]C[Jay: If you could capture the weak W group in the center, YES.]

(;B[lg]C[Jay: If W saves the three stones around O13, B may not  have enough territory by this move. 

Let's roughly count the pts: For B, this move secures 25 pts, in the center.  Plus, 16 pts. on the right.  12pts in LR, and 14 pts in the LL.  Totaling 67 pts. 

W's pts: Left 28pts, UR 15, lower center 25 strong, plus sente and komi 11 pts. Totaling, 69 pts. 

It is a close game.];W[lh]
(;B[jl]C[Jay: This move is in conflict with the earlier one.]
;W[lk]C[Jay: Now, W has protected its weakness of the weak group.
B has missed the opportunity.  This exchange is bad.]
(;B[jn]C[This was too small.

Jay: Saving M3 stone and this move are Miai.  Thus, this move is not urgent.  Protecting the upper center is urgent.]

(;W[nq]C[Jay: This W's move is also smaller than the center, almost cancelled B's small move earlier.]

(;B[or]C[Jay: This is too small.  Protecting the upper center is urgent now.  This is the losing move.]

C[Suggestions on building this territory?

Jay: K14 is a bit better, but not enough to win.  At this point it's hard to stop L13 stone.]
;W[jh]C[Jay: This move should'v been L14.];B[ig]C[Atari would have been correct here, mistake.]
;W[kf];B[je]C[Jay: At this point B lacks territory and W's groups are solid.  No more comment beyond this point.  

You played a solid technical game.  It's the judgement of priority that affected the result.  Of course, to us lowly amature, this is one big question, beside correct technical moves.  It's the degree that makes a difference.  This is what makes Go interesting and challenging. Thanks for presenting the game.]

W will also have to find reduction in LR corner to explore weakness around R4. So, W is too busy. After L13, B's only weaker group is the LR corner which is not really weak.]
