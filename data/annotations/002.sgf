outcome of the game];W[mj]C[MM: B shape crumbles. The difference is
too huge for words.];B[lj];W[lk];B[mk];W[nj];B[kj];W[jg]C[MM: Vital point,
painful for b];B[kh];W[kk]
(;B[ii]C[This move has to be on K9 I think];W[jj]C[MM: strange move.]
(;B[ji]C[MM: weak response];W[jk]
(;B[dj]C[MM: Wrong direction, for 2 reasons:
a) b center can become weak
b) w wall is weak, should be attacked using the c14
stone];W[ej];B[ci];W[dk];B[cj]

a chance to strike back again]

correct idea];W[ei];B[ef]C[MM: W seems to be in big trouble, but b
must be careful to connect everything];W[ee]
(;B[gi]C[MM: too loose. If b connects safely, he will have no
problems];W[lg];B[kf];W[hh]C[MM: Good point. Makes it tough for Black.

could play C12 and

though.];W[fk];B[el];W[fj];B[hk];W[fl];B[hl];W[bj]C[MM: It seems B will lose the side group]

meaning.];W[bi];B[bh];W[fm];B[cm];W[bm];B[bn]C[I think that E6 is the vital
point for both now, is that correct?]
