C[Hello Reviewer!

I am John and I played white. This game was played at the Austin Texas AGA spring tournament.  This was the first round and I played white and lost. If I remember correctly the score was 62B 32 W.
I entered, and left the tournament as 18kyu. Black, Anderson, entered the tournament as 19 kyu and left as 18 kyu (and won all four rounds and the section trophy.)

I made a couple of comments about places where I should have played differently. I stopped recording the game at move 216, which wasn't the end of the game, but most things were determined by then.

I did well keeping the center, but he built a huge mojo that I wasn't able to reduce. Although I recognize that I should have prevented the mojo in the first place, I would like to see some ideas about how to reduce or invade the left side territory after move 31.

Thank you,

John Gossett.];B[cp]C[Dear John I understand your concerns about the lower left. However you had many other opportunities to win this game. Particularly your chances against the group in the lower right. I have added many variations to the game record some of which may help. When you feel that you fall behind you need to think about opportunites to cause a bit of an upset. At your level these opportunities will occur but you need to be brave and watchful. Once the opportunity occurs pounce. Enjoy the cut and thrust of the game and don't just follow your opponents move.  Best wishes

;B[qc];W[hc];B[fc];W[qi];B[eq];W[cf]LB[cj:A]C[This move was basically my undoing, at least from how I played it.  The pincer move he responded with worked perfectly with his C3 shimari to create a huge mojo. In retrospect I should have played c10 or d10. (Around A)

A would be a better point as an approach from either side would allow extention in the other direction. One point above A can also work. You really need to allow space for a three point extention.]

;B[pl];W[pr];B[mr];W[lr];B[cl]C[From this point I was at a loss as to how to invade this left side territory. Any thoughts would be very helpful to my game.

Black has invested a lot of moves here so he will be strong. The aim can be to reduce not to invade. Two options are shown. Remember that it is important to play lightly and to be willing to sacrafice some stones. You do not appear to be willing to sacrafice stone to gain advantage. It seems that most of the stones that you sacrafice are really just abandoned!]

(;W[ko]C[This move is not really doing much. Think about your strategy. What is it and how does this move forward your strategy? 33 would at least widen your space and reduce blacks area.]

;B[ib]C[This seems very unpleasant.];W[cc]C[I like this move and you should be able to live here. However it might  cost you on the outside. After black has made life on the top is a little too late. Invasion would be better before this.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec]
(;W[ed]LB[bd:a]C[Should be at a. Look at variation.];B[bc]C[It is a big loss to lose these two stones. Blacks conern is very large and you have very little compensation on the outside.]

(;W[mf]C[What is your aim with this move. It would seem better to destroy blacks group in the lower right. He is vurnerable here and you are strong around him. Punish him here and you can still win the game! See variation]

;B[fi];W[gh];B[gj];W[fj];B[ei];W[hj];B[gk];W[hi]C[Very heavy!]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[gl];W[hl];B[hh];W[im]C[While these moves have recued this white group you have given black a lot of territory. It is not really a moyo at this stage, he is very strong. However you are very strong facing his position in the lower right and you have to punish him since you have given up so much on the lower left.]
;B[jf];W[jg];B[gd];W[ff];B[qm];W[qn]C[Is there a better way to respond here? It seems I should have been able to keep this group of stones from living.

Standard killing moves are :
Split the group
Reduce the eye space
Play in the middle];B[qk]
(;W[gr]C[Need to focus on killing black. This point is to small for you to win.]
;B[gn]C[Good point for black, secures the territory];W[rc]C[Again too small at this point unless you kill this group instead. This is possible.]
;B[mk]C[Protects against splitting this group. Much more difficult to kill at this stage.]
;W[lj];B[rn];W[ro];B[sm];W[ol]C[Can't really split although you can reduces his eye potential. Still possible to kill but more difficult.]
;B[om];W[ok];B[pm];W[rj];B[on];W[oo];B[op];W[rk]C[Feels a bit slow. Black can only make one eye here I think.]
;B[rl];W[pk];B[nl];W[mj]LB[mn:a]C[should be near a to stop him making two eyes.]
;B[ln]C[Key point, very difficult to kill after this. I think if you had killed this bottom right group could have won the game. Certainly it would have compared with the black position on the left.]
