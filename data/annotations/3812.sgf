C[Xris: Hi, I have a couple of questions in this game and would really appreciate an answer. Thank you for taking the time to review my game.


Chris

prana: thanks for giving me this interesting game to analyze.
You played a good fuseki, with only minor errors concerning the direction of play. Also, you play shows a good sense of style.

But, in the middle game you got serious trouble with weak groups. This struggle dominated and decided the game.
To avoid being harrassed like that
- try to understand the concept of sabaki
- try to have never more than one weak group
- study live and death

Best regards,
Christian (prana).];B[pd];W[cp];B[op];W[dc];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq]
;W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp];W[qp]C[Xris: Was it correct to approach here?
prana: yes, it's good. The shimaro would be a great point for Black.]

C[prana: well done.];B[ce];W[ch]TR[cn]C[prana: you are low on the left side, so I wouldn't be too keen on playing a pincer here. Instead, I would rather extend on the top.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[gc];B[fc];W[fb];B[dd]C[prana: poor style. B is pushing from behind.]

(;W[id]C[Xris:  Maybe I should have gone into the corner and shouldnt worry too much about the side. But again I am not sure.
prana: wC17 would have been stronger, because it is the vital point for the black AND the white group.]
;B[cc];W[nc]LB[mc:A]TR[id]C[Xris: Here I think I should have approached from the other side.
prana: Why? No, this side is better because you are high here. You are low on the right side, so no need to play there.
But you are a little over-extended on the top, so maybe better A.]
;B[qf];W[qh]C[prana: In my opinion this is the wrong direction. See comments above.]
;B[pc]LB[kc:A][qj:B][ck:C]C[prana: B is happy to secure the corner. Now B has several invasion points.]
;W[me]LB[kc:B][ld:A][qj:C]C[Xris:  This seemed to have been a mistake, since I cant see a way to stop B from doing what he will in a minute.
prana: Yes. Bad shape. Better A or B.
But, as you can see, R12 is gote and there is still a weak point at C. That's why I don't really like it.]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[nb]

;B[mc];W[ob];B[nd];W[na];B[md];W[lb];B[kc];W[kb];B[jc];W[pb]
;B[qb];W[oc]C[Xris: seems horrible for W but at least sente. (or at least B answered.)
prana: it is sente, but B gets a beautiful wall, and has wiped out the white territory at the top. Horrible, yes.]
;B[od]
(;W[gd];B[eb];W[gb];B[db]
(;W[lq]C[Xris: I think this invasion was the reason I lost (together with the messed up White top). This gave B the chance to get too much on the bottom lefthand centre
prana: Hm, the invasion is not that bad. But it is a little too early. You should strengthen yourself on the outside first.]
;B[lo]C[prana: Since w cannot escape anymore, he has to live inside now. I.e. you have to make sabaki]
;W[or];B[oq]
(;W[nr]C[prana: Too slow and heavy! In such situations try to play light, make eye-shape and be prepared to sacrifice single stones.]
;B[kr]C[prana: this really hurts! W is now heavy and is going to have a hard time.]

;W[qs]C[prana: bad style. It doesn't help you in getting eyes, but it weakens your right group.]

(;B[rs]C[prana: also wrong. Now w is happy again];W[ps];B[rr]
;W[ls];B[ns];W[kk];B[em];W[dl];B[cj]LB[dm:A]C[Xris: here again is such a ripoff as on the top side. to me this looks like overplay, but Ididnt think i could kill it or connect.
prana: I think this is a good move. It doesn't look like an overplay to me. B is very strong in the upper left. W has a weak group on the top. And there is some aji because of the cut at A.]
;W[eh];B[ej];W[el];B[gj];W[gh];B[ij];W[ki];B[ih]C[prana: splitting attack. B is strong at fighting.]

;B[jl];W[fn];B[gn];W[fj]C[Xris: Thought there was a squeeze, but nvm]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[fj];W[fh];B[en]C[prana: not necessary. B should continue to attack your weak upper groups.]
;W[gf]C[prana: this point is too good to allow. B should have played here first.]

(;B[jb]C[prana: This is not a big threat anymore. But w has to be careful]
;W[pn]C[prana: you are running into bad shape and you are forcing b to play a good move.]
;B[on]TR[pn]C[prana: exchange is good for B];W[pj]C[prana: big move. but...]

(;B[mj];W[lk];B[mk];W[kg]

C[prana: ensuring live for such a big group can hardly be blamed, but...
It is a small move: around 5 points in gote. There are much bigger moves, which threaten also to make the second eye.
Just think about A.];B[dh];W[ei]LB[cg:A]C[prana: there is no need in giving the atari. (B cannot play here anyway)
Thus, better A];B[fo];W[ci]LB[cg:A]C[prana: again better A (big forcing move)]
