Hi. My name is Joe and I'm roughly 1d.

I marked all my comments with a "J:" and I also included a general overview at the end.

Enjoy.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd]C[I was aiming to play the chinese opening here.]

(;W[ec]C[Is this a good response to prevent the Chinese? I had a feeling it was somewhat subotpimal since his approach is sort of "pincered" by my other corner, meaning I'm still at a slight advantage. So, I decided to take the last corner instead of replying locally.

J: There's nothing wrong with his move.];B[dp]MA[ic][id][hd]
[hc]C[J: There's nothing wrong your move in the open corner here.

You could also consider playing a loose pincer on any of the marked points. This would serve to both attack the white stone and work with your stone at Q16. This also keeps in the theme of the Chinese opening you were striving for.]

(;W[hd]C[Is my intuition right when it tells me that H16 is not as good at H17? Like this, white doesn't have as stable a base, I feel.


J: H17 is more secure, but white would be flat. 
White's move is much more attractive since it gives more potential to extend further right.]
;B[dc]C[My intuition here was to make white heavy and over-concentrated, I had expected a reply at E16.

J: E16 is the normal response. It would be followed by black extending down the left side and white extending along the top.]

(;W[df];B[ed]C[I decide to keep white separated.];W[fc];B[fd]
C[Was this an over play?

J: This move threatens white's 2 stones. It does allow white to strengthen his top side, but it also weakens the stone at D14. 
I think this move is fine.];W[gd];B[cf]C[J: You have 4 options for dealing with this stone:
1. Ignore it and play elsewhere.
2. Pincer around D11
3. Further seperate the stone around F14
4. Extend from your group like you did.

You are looking to increase the size of your corner, but you are already alive and this is small.
I'd prefer to either ignore or pincer.];W[de];B[dd];W[ce];B[be]

;W[od];B[oe];W[pe]C[Since white hadn't protected his own cutting point, I thought I could just counter cut

J: I'd counter-cut as well. But we're looking at a very difficult fight for both sides that is difficult to read out, due to the base-less stones in the top center that are about to be cut off.]

(;W[lc];B[lb];W[kc];B[kb];W[nf];B[of];W[lg];B[ji]C[J: Your wall is huge.

At this point, you have a healthy lead. White is going to have a tough game to catch up.]

(;W[gf]C[J: This move wasn't needed at all. This was a nice gift from white. White needs to take sente elsewhere in order to make up the difference.]

;W[mp];B[op]C[J: Simple moves work at this point. No need to complicate things.]
;W[oq];B[oo];W[po];B[pn];W[on]C[J: Your influence makes white's cut very difficult.]
;B[nn];W[om];B[no];W[pl];B[pq];W[qq];B[pr];W[qr];B[qp]C[J: At this time, white's corner is completely decimated. 
White doesn't have a great place to get more territory. The game looks finished.]

White resigned here. Could white still have won? It felt like his stones weren't placed very efficiently.

J: This is a good place to resign. White has no good prospects left in this game. He could still live on the right side, but it isn't enough.

The fight in the top right that continued on the top ended heavily in your favor. White was going to have a hard time making up the difference. Losing the corner where he had the first move sealed the deal. Those 2 fights determined the game.]
