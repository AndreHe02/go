Glyn Normington wrote: "I have trouble defending corners and would appreciate hints and tips especially in that respect."

The upper-right corner is lost because it remained open to a 3-3 invasion until the very end. The lower-left corner is lost because the corner stone is left open to an atttack from both sides by an early failure to extend into the left side. Also, no attempt is really made at invading the upper-left corner at the 3-3 point as it should. However, the game is not so much lost on tactical issues having to do with corners as on the inability to create strong groups without weaknesses, or to exploit the weaknesses that the opponent leaves open. In other words, the game is not lost 20 points at a time in the corners, but 5 points at a time all over the place.]

Migeru: W invites a game with crossed corners];B[dp]CR[pp]C[Migeru: B accepts. If B did not want a fighting game Q4 would have been better.]
;W[pp];B[jd]
(;W[eq]CR[fq]C[White seems to attack the corner early. Is this reasonable?

Migeru: Yes, W needs to make up B's initial advantage, and so is expected to play more aggressively. E3 is, however, too aggressive for my taste. I prefer the standard knight's move approach at F3.]
;B[dq];W[hq]CR[eq]LB[fq:1][gq:2]C[Migeru: White plays a theoretically ideal extension leaving two empty spaces from a single stone. Black seems overconcentrated in the lower left.]

(;B[mp]C[Maybe this should have been at L4 or L3 to squeeze E3/H3. I'm not sure.

Migeru: B is asking for trouble, as it is very easy for W to extend from E3-H3 and pinch the black stone at N4. Personally I would have extended on the left side. See the variations.]

(;W[nq]C[Migeru: W obviously likes to play contact moves rather than attacking from a distance. This only strengthens B if answered appropriately.]
;B[mq]C[Migeru: the right reply under the circumstances]
(;W[kq]C[Migeru: This leaves white's corner vulnerable. See the variations.]

(;B[mn]C[Apart from trying to maintain connection with the centre, I'm not sure what this move achieves. Perhaps I should have played on the left hand or right hand star point.

Migeru: No, the groups on the lower side are not yet settled, especially the B's. I suggest a move on the second line and then an escape to the center. See the variation.]
;W[qm]CR[lr][nr]C[Migeru: this is a mistake:it does not put pressure on B nor defends the lower side.]
;B[pj]C[Migeru: this is passive.];W[qj];B[qi];W[qk];B[ri];W[gc]
CR[rj][lr][nr]C[Migeru: Ths is reckless, as W would soon have to go back to the right side (except that B never attacks there). On the other hand, B does not seem to be putting much pressure on W, so W feels safe.]
;B[dj]C[Migeru: this seems to be more concerned with occupying the star points than with actually putting pressure on W or making territory.]
;W[cg]CR[cc]C[The symmetric extensions are vulnerable to a 3-3 invasion.]

(;B[ci]C[Migeru: this is timid and does not really make a lot of territory. The alternative makes 20 points in W's corner.]
;W[co]CR[cm]TR[bq][dr]C[I found it hard to respond well to C5. If I defend with C4, I might get shut in. Maybe D5 would have been ok.

Migeru: this is why B should have played at the circled intersection back in move 9. I think the corner is essentially indefensible at this point because of W's moves at the triangled points.]
;B[dn]CR[dl][do]C[I chose D6 to try to maintain links with D10.

Migeru: a 3-space gap is not a link. Moreover, you are inviting an inmediate cut.]

C[I'm never sure how to attack an invasion in the corner.

Migeru: W is alive now, and B needs to connect at E4 before W does and takes the entire corner.]

(;B[bh]CR[bg]TR[cc][gc][cg]C[I played this because I sensed the top left corner was getting too strong for white, but it was probably too early in the game to play this kind of move. I suppose I should have been making sure I held the top right corner. It seems I've lost 3 out of 4 corners already, which is not unusual for me.

Migeru: this just invites W to play at B13 and close off the corner completely. The right thing to do is to invade at the 3-3 point because W's symmetric long-knight's-jumps are vulnerable to it.]
;W[bg]C[Migeru: what else did B expect?];B[dg]CR[ch]C[Migeru: another weakness. Playing in contact is no way to box in your opponent.]

(;B[mh]CR[fh][ej][dm][en]C[At last I try to enclose some territory.

Migeru: Your tone indicates that you think B is lost. See the variations for more interesting moves B could make. 

Using area scoring, W now has 65 points in the upper left, 40 point in the lower left, and 35 points on the lower right.

Bhas 50 point on the left side, and about 80 in the upper right following the last move. 

The reason the game is not even close even though the scores are is that W has a uch easier job making territory in the centre, because of all the (marked) weaknesses in B's structure.]

;W[jj];B[ki];W[hj];B[ik]CR[jf][mh][gi][sl][nr]C[Isolates K10, but white has been building strength to attack the F15 and E12 groups. In retrospect they look very weak and need connecting up to D8 which also needs forming into a safer shape.

Migeru: correct. However, B lost the initiative with N12, which should have been used to attack at K14, T8 or o2, or maybe to defend the weaknesses by playing at G11 in exchange for losing the initiative.]

(;B[gh]CR[eg][dh][fh][di][fi][ej]C[Maybe F11 would have been better - giving up on the F15 group but starting to close off white's formation as it spreads towards the lower left. I cannot control white's spread downwards without losing territory.

Migeru: Yes, because of the atari at F11, the F14 group is dead anyway.]

Migeru: W made 35 solid points, while B can aspire to make at most 50 in the center, but has not really grabbed any more than maybe 20 yet. This means that W's lead has doubled since the last time I counted and in fact, by my reckoning, W has secured  about 175 points (area scoring) and needs only 181 to win (178 with the Komi).]

Migeru: the 2-1 point is a good place to play when trying to kill a corner group. In this case, however, you need to prevent W from making a second eye. As for general principles, study "life and death". The corner really is no different than any other place on the board.]
