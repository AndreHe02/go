AB[dd][pp][pd][dp][dj][pj][jp][jd][jj]C[Game played: 3/16/2000 at 21:47  I played black in this game at our weekly Go club meeting.  I
was pleased with the game since I don't usually do this well
against white even with 9 stones

Cyril -> Hi, I tried my best. Since I'm not a very good player, they may be some  mistakes in my comments (and in my english too) : be careful.

You played quite well, avoiding all complications which the best thing to do in a 9 stones
handicap game.  You may be able to have a more occurate play if you always try to separate white's group. The other point is that you lose sente too easily in the beginning
of the game. Keep in mind the two words "separate" and "sente" and you will be stronger
in handicap games.];W[cn];B[fp];W[nq];B[pn];W[cf]
(;B[fd]TR[dj]LB[ce:A]C[Single skips like 2, 4 and 6 are my standard response to these
approach moves in a high handicap game

Cyril -> This is ok, of course, and simple. 'A' in c15 is also playable with the presence
of D10.];W[fj]C[Cyril -> this is classical. According to a book I read, black has to option here : get out
or sacrifice his stone. The second one is difficult because you must have a compensation
for your stone : you have to push white from both side.];B[el]
;W[dk];B[dl]TR[ek]C[White told me that this was a good move.  He had expected me
to play at the triangle

Cyril -> yes it seems to be good.];W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[Is this too passive for black?

Cyril -> yes it is too passive. In general,  White is happy if Black is passive, because he knows how
black will answer most of the time. Here you don't have to simplify white's play :
keep his stones seperated (see var).];W[cp];B[pq]C[I wanted to drive white towards my strong group on the bottom
left];W[jq]TR[kq]C[I had expected this to be at the triangle]

Cyril -> in theory yes. Here I don't know.];W[kq];B[ko];W[ir]
;B[hq];W[no]TR[hr]C[I had expected white to play at the triangle

Cyril -> Don't think that, white wants to escape, he has no use of a surrounded group. Moreover, H2 is a yose move.]

(;B[qn]SQ[pj]C[I decided to sacrifice the stone marked with the square in exchange
for more security in the corner.  Was this a good choice?

Cyril -> I don't think so, you allow a ponuki, white gains a lot of influence. Try to separate
white's groups, territory is not your priority at this moment of the game.]
;W[oj]
(;B[jc]LB[pc:A][cl:B]C[I decided to drive white towards the corner while starting to
secure the top left

Cyril -> if you want to make points, I think you'd better play at 'A', since it makes  territory in one move. You need one more move to make territory in the upper left.
Personnally I want to play at 'B', but I don't know if it's a good move.]
;W[qc]LB[pc:A]C[Cyril -> It seems natural, a move at 'A' would be painful for white]

(;B[qd]TR[jc][jd]C[Cyril -> I prefer block at the other side, since it works well with the marked stones. And the
white ponuki negates your influence.];W[pc];B[cd];W[ck]
(;B[cj]C[Cyril -> I prefer the other side, but I don't know who is right.]
;W[cl];B[ch]TR[gh][eh]SQ[cf]LB[dh:A][eg:B]C[I wanted to pressure the white stone at the square so it would
run out and let me build a wall around the triangles
