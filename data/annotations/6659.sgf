C[Hello Reviewer.  I played this game at a Go club I started at school.  This was a REALLY close game, and I am kind of bummed that I lost.  Can you point out my mistakes for me?  I played as black in this game.]
;B[pd]C[s> Hello D'mitri, It is my pleasure to comment on your game.

Here are the possible places to change:
4: D15 early moves between his plays.
19: Q14 too much on the 4th row
24: E3 white need to use his strength.
69: K6 try attacking indirectly by cutting off a group
80: G5 white misses a chance to cut off 4 stones.
107: J13 try using a net rather than atari
115: H13 seems like "pass"
123: M7 attack from a distance.
205: H19 endgame move to kill upper left corner.
217: O7 threaten from outside : 2 points.
269: S4 keep up the ko, another threat at D17

I see you strong in the opening and middle game.  I think you lost steam near the end, missing some chances to capture a bit of space, and giving up too soon on the ko fight.]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[dq]
(;B[de]C[s> I think that approaching D17 with D3 behind is helping white develop, I would suggest something closer to C10.]
;W[dh];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc]C[I know I extended the wrong way.  Should have been at (e,16) right?  I just learned that joseki so I forgot.

s> E16 seems to connect with D15 and lean into K16 more, threatening growth into F18.  I like how F17 grows influence.]
;W[dd];B[ee];W[fb];B[gc]C[Did I still play this out well?

s> it does seem consistent with other moves, Q16, Q4 and later E5 area are all for influence.  The danger is that you are forcing the opponent to get territory.]
;W[co];B[pj]C[Would it have been better to extend from my top left group to ( L,17) or around that area?

s> I think Q10 works well with Q4, Q16 and G17.];W[kd];B[id]
C[Was that a good answer?

s> It seems too high to make eye space, but maybe that's ok.  I do like pushing from G17, to get it more of a footing.  If you had N17 for example, white may J17 and G17 has a hard time making a base.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf];W[ck];B[jp]C[I thought that it was good to take the last big point in the opening.

s> nice play];W[hq];B[ep]C[I thought that this shouder hit was timed pretty well.

s> It is really fun to play these types of things.  White already has the corner, so why not get something going.  Although in this case white has too much strength for this to work out I think.  Maybe play lightly, allowing a stone or two to die, while building up around his attack.]

(;W[eq];B[fp];W[fq];B[ho]C[I was going for influence.

s> white ends up over concentrated, using too many stones to defend that area.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[qb];W[pb];B[kc]C[s> If you are trying to attack and maybe kill O17, then move further away, not making contact.  touch = defending, distant = attacking.]

C[Was it good to tenuki here because I ended up losing the corner.

s> yes, I thik it is worth it.  O17 seems alive, so losing R17 stones doesn't change life / death.]

P.S. I hope my comments help!

s> I see your rank as 10k.  Here are the clues I use when judging your rank:
- strong opening and middle game, 
- opportunity to learn end game.
- opportunity to learn with ko threats.
- need to see chance to kill groups
- need to look for bigger moves, what will make the most difference for points, connections, threats.
- need to try sacrificing a stone here and there.
- need to avoid "pass" moves.])
