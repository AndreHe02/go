C[Inego: Hi, I'm Yanis Batura from Novosibirsk, Russia, I play as Googol [7k\] on KGS.
The review was requested for Black.

Summary:
The reason why Black lost was the numerous mistakes they made. One certain weakness of Black is their endgame (yose) Playing more real-time games is recommended.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk];W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[Inego: Taking Q9 into account, P17 would've been better (see var).]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[fq];W[ce]C[Inego: Since White didn't answer 11, you should've continued with C6.]
;B[iq];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn]
(;B[qj]C[Inego: Strange form. It would be better to put more pressure on the 3 White stones by playing closer to them (see variation).]
;W[oq];B[or];W[pp];B[nq];W[op];B[qr];W[mo]
(;B[cn]C[Inego: Maybe too early to tenuki. It would be wiser to settle the area near 26 (see var).]
;W[eo]
(;B[ck]C[The common answer is C3 (see var).];W[eq]C[Inego: Attaching is a very aggressive move by W that requires an immediate answer!]
;B[lq]LB[fp:A][fr:B]C[Inego: A or B is a must. Even if there were no 30 move by W, 31 isn't the the best local option, it's too passive and low. One point higher (M4) is better.]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[co]C[Inego: Black have let White get a corner when this could be easily prevented.]
;B[ch]C[Inego: Again, Black stone C6 is left. Now W have a natural strong move D6.]
;W[mm];B[hc];W[dn];B[cm];W[qb]C[40 is pushing into the corner. Blocking at S18 is a very big move.]
;B[eb];W[db];B[ec];W[ne]
(;B[og]C[Inego: Better form is P14 (see var).];W[jn];B[jj]C[Inego: There were better moves. Your top-left group is quite weak and it'd be natural to strengthen it by a move like E15. Also, N9 is a natural pressure at unsettled W group Q6, building territory at the same time.]
;W[kp];B[kq];W[cg]
(;B[bg]C[Inego: Bad move, because the natural answer by White is sente. Better is D13 (see var).]
;W[bf];B[bh];W[dg]C[Inego: 54 is a sente move threatening D12, you must answer it by putting a stone of your color there.]
;B[nj]C[Inego: N9 works better with your tengen stone.];W[dh]
;B[di];W[ei];B[dj];W[fg]C[Inego: Your top left group still needs attention.]

(;B[mg];W[rc];B[rd];W[ib];B[hb];W[lf];B[lg];W[er];B[fr];W[rb]
;B[ic];W[jb];B[lp]C[Inego: This move is very small and should be reserved for yose (endgame).]
;W[lo];B[jp];W[hn];B[ko];W[kn];B[lj]LB[fe:A]C[Inego: Move A is better since it strengthens your weak group.]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[fl];B[jf];W[hg];B[ih];W[ik];B[hi]C[Inego: This is small. Try to count how many points it has earned you.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[sd];B[se];W[sc];B[rf];W[rn];B[ro];W[ea];B[fa]
;W[da];B[ie]TR[fa][eb][ec]C[Inego: This move serves no purpose. S8 is much better. Locally, an iron pillar extension to E16 is good, because the triangle stones can be attacked.]
;W[ed]TR[fa][eb][ec]C[Inego: W punishes by attacking weak black stones.]
;B[fc]C[Inego: Now the bot can push even further (to F16), enlarging its territory at the same time.]
;W[fs];B[gs];W[es];B[mf];W[hr]
(;B[hq]TR[gq][fq][fr]C[Inego: Good. Connecting at G2 leads to lost of the three stones.]
;W[gr];B[ir];W[hs];B[is];W[gs]
(;B[me]C[Inego: You could catch the two stones in a ladder (see var).]
;W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[dm];W[em];B[md];W[mc]
(;B[gd]C[Inego: Too passive. This means you didn't take what was given to you by your own moves 113 and 119. You had better moves (see var).]

;W[jg];B[jh]C[Inego: You are still ahead by a small margin (about 4).]
;W[ag];B[hh]C[Inego: You should've answered 168 immediately, since this is the endgame.]
