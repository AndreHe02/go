C[[Berg\] This game is commented for black, focusing on the opening and endgame as per request.

A general comment is that both sides played relatively true to their level without large deviations.
My first overall impression is that black would have benefited by laying more long-term plans, instead of making / reacting to local threats all the time.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dq];B[fc]TR[jp][jd]SQ[do]C[[Berg\] The triangles mark better "book moves".
D5 would have been an agressive attack, if you wanted to adopt an offensive playing style.
F17 is defensive but secures corner territory.];W[cj];B[qf]
TR[jq][kd][do][jp][qj][qm][qn]C[[Berg\] R7 is too small.  All the marked moves would have been better.  A hoshi (4-4) stone is not weak and does not need any reinforcement unless attacked this early in the game.
My choice would have been R6 here.];W[qj]C[[Berg\] White hopes for a large framework.]
;B[mc]TR[jp]C[[Berg\] Too passive!];W[cg]TR[jp]C[[Berg\] Had I played white I'd played K4 here.]
;B[bf]C[[Berg\] Too small.  Never play on the second line this early.
The rule of thumb for openings:
First corners then sides, using the third and fourth line.

Worst of all: B14 is so extremely gote.];W[cf]C[at this point it became obvious to me how badly my opening was going

[Berg\] The black opening has secured about 70 moku, so far leaving the rest for white.
Take sente and play for influence not territory this early in the game.]
;B[be]TR[jp][ce]C[[Berg\] If you should give any heed to white at all, why not C15? I think it's too early for dogfights, i'd split white's corners with K4.]
;W[gg]C[[Berg\] Does white really imagine to get everything south of 14? G13 makes no sense.]
;B[cn]TR[jp]C[[Berg\] The right idea! Don't let white muck around all alone on 3/4 of the board.  C6 is somewhat enclosed by white already, I think K4 is better.]

(;W[do];B[bp]TR[jp][em]C[[Berg\] Another stone on the second line.....
Better to break out or diversify.];W[cl];B[dm];W[jq];B[gp]TR[dm]
[cn][bp]C[[Berg\] The last four black stones has helped white get a stronger mojo.  They have not built territory and are not yet safe.]
;W[fq];B[fn];W[gq];B[cr]C[[Berg\] Now black has a secure base.  But white has grown strong.]
;W[hp];B[go];W[ho];B[mq];W[oq];B[mo];W[qm];B[kr];W[jr];B[kq]
;W[kp]TR[kr][kq][mq][mo]C[[Berg\] Again, four black stones that helps white get stronger, without much gain for black.]
;B[lp];W[ko];B[lo];W[gn];B[gm];W[hn];B[eo]C[[Berg\] Too much dogfight too early...
On the other hand, black has to invade and reduce the white framework.]
;W[ep]C[I think I should have played f5 here instead of solidifying my group, as that was a 5 point move

[Berg\] E4 is the setup for the snap-back.  So F5 would have been good.]

(;B[dn]TR[pi][jj][eg][po]C[[Berg\] A few possible alternatives are marked.
I think the skirmish in the corner is too small for now, and there are bigger moves to play.]

;W[gj];B[il];W[jm];B[jl];W[km];B[np]TR[nl][mm]C[[Berg\] O4 looks pointless.]
;W[id];B[hc]TR[po][pi][hf][if]C[[Berg\] J16 could have been cut off, or black could simply have played elsewhere.]
;W[hd];B[ic];W[jd];B[jc];W[ji];B[el]TR[ef][po][pi][qi]C[[Berg\] E8 is a small gote move.]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[gk];B[fj];W[ej];B[fi];W[gi];B[ei];W[dj];B[eg]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[fg];B[dh];W[ef];B[ch]TR[gh]C[[Berg\] G12, answered by H12, followed  by a cut on H11 could get interesting.]
;W[bh];B[df];W[dg];B[bg];W[eh]
(;B[bi];W[di];B[eg];W[gh];B[ce]C[[Berg\] Black has played this invasion and ko-fight well.]
;W[eh];B[dg]TR[nl][mm]C[[Berg\] D13 is too small.];W[mm];B[nq]
TR[lm]C[[Berg\] Divide and conquer!];W[qq];B[kj];W[ki];B[lj]
;W[nj];B[li];W[lh];B[mi];W[ni];B[mh];W[lg];B[mg]C[[Berg\] What is black's plan?  What is he trying to kill?  Where does he want to invade?  What is he reducing?]
;W[le];B[me];W[ld];B[lc];W[qh];B[on]TR[bk];W[om];B[nn];W[pn]
;B[nm];W[nl];B[ml]TR[ol];W[ol];B[lm];W[ll];B[mn]TR[ln]C[[Berg\] Let the kill wait.]
;W[mk];B[lk]TR[kl][mm]C[[Berg\] Make the kill now, or split white with L8.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[would r16 have been better here? or is there another way to attack this?

[Berg\] Q17 or R16 are joseki.  Both will drive white along the "other" edge.  As N17 is stronger than R14 I think R16 would have been a better response.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qa]C[I feel like s18 or t17would have been the better move here, but I'm not sure]

(;B[rc]C[[Berg\] S17 is fine but S18 would have been better.]
;W[rd];B[qd]C[[Berg\] Very good!  White should die after the mistake of S16.]
;W[rb];B[qb]TR[sc]C[[Berg\] Let the kill wait.  Keep white divided.
If white plays R18 black S15 will kill white.];W[re]C[here I'm not sure, was I right to respond to this, he obviously considered my ko threats insignificant]

(;B[rf]C[[Berg\] This is only dangerous because black didn't play T17. This ko fight should not have started. With everything being as it is S14 is ok.]
;W[qc];B[jn]TR[kf][cp][fp]C[[Berg\] A few other plays to consider.]
;W[sc];B[kn];W[jp];B[in];W[mm];B[kl]C[[Berg\] White won the ko fight and black gained a little.  This is as it should be.]
;W[ml];B[lf]TR[si]C[[Berg\] Monkey jump.  Worth 10 points.]
;W[kf];B[mf];W[jg];B[jj]TR[dr][co][or][si][bk]C[[Berg\] Five probably better alternatives.]
;W[ij];B[ii];W[jh];B[hj];W[hi];B[ik];W[ih];B[ij]C[[Berg\] A nice steal.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[cp];B[co];W[dp];B[aq]TR[oh][si][or][ds][bk]C[[Berg\] A3 is very small.]
;W[nr];B[mr];W[os];B[oo];W[po];B[fe]TR[si][bk][ff]C[I'm interested to know if there was a more effective method of reducing here, especially keeping sente

[Berg\] I consider all three alternatives to be stronger moves.]
;W[ff];B[ge]TR[ff]C[[Berg\] Had black cut when the chance was there E14 would have died.]
;W[he];B[gd];W[ed];B[ee];W[cc];B[dc];W[cb];B[db]C[[Berg\] The current white invasion looks doomed already.]
;W[og]
(;B[of]C[[Berg\] P14 is ok.  But black P12 a little while ago would have been better.]
;W[pg];B[pf];W[rg];B[ng]TR[qg]C[[Berg\] R13 is sente.];W[oh]
;B[sf];W[sg];B[se];W[sd];B[oa];W[pa];B[qg];W[rh];B[kd]TR[bk]
C[I'm pretty sure I should have waited on this move as it lost sente

[Berg\] I think B9 is bigger.];W[ke];B[kc];W[md];B[nd];W[bj]
;B[hf];W[if];B[gf];W[hg];B[aj]TR[bl]C[[Berg\] Not any big moves left.]
;W[bl];B[al];W[bk];B[ak];W[cm];B[bn];W[ba];B[bc]TR[ds][js][qe]
C[[Berg\] B19 is not sente, white is dead.];W[io]C[this was where the game would be decided I think, white losing sente here was key]
;B[js];W[is];B[ks];W[hr];B[ms]TR[ds]C[[Berg\] White can ignore N1.  D1 is better.]
;W[ns];B[ds];W[es];B[cs]C[throughout the endgame I try to play the sente moves, but earlier in the game before the pieces come together it's very hard for me to get sente

[Berg\] It didn't have to be.  A more expansive opening would have helped a lot.]
;W[er];B[ci]C[at this point I'd run out of sente moves, but luckily white didn't reduce me by a single point]
;W[nh];B[qe]
(;W[op]C[I believe this is the move that finally decided it, however, was there a better method of playing the endgame that wouldn't have forced me to reky on black making yose mistakes?

[Berg\] I have pointed out some things, for example the monkey jump on T11 and the tricky stone on B9.]
;B[em];C[
I realize if he had not played such a horrible endgame and chosen one of his many options to reduce me by a point he would have won.

[Berg\] True. But in the endgame you simply played smarter than white, and gained a few points.

Play more for influence, especially early in the game.  Invade early and leave aji stones for later. Don't focus only on territory. Always look for possible moves elswhere!

This was a well balanced game with white playing a stronger opening, but black getting it back in the endgame.   Unfortunately white could have won had he done a few mistakes less.  The opening sets the premises for most of the game, so you would have gained the most simply by playing the opening better.

Good luck, and happy go-ing!])
