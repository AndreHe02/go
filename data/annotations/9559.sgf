Elathalion [8k\]: gl hf];W[dd]C[Hi :) Hope this is useful. There will be lots to look at in a handicap game, but for your next review it is perhaps worth submitting an even game to see what your opening is like. 

Don't worry too much about the variations I have put in, but focus on the comments instead.]
;B[cf]C[I usually approach the corner in a handicap game... seems like the active way of playing.

Yes, it's important to be active in handicap games- it's very easy to throw away a handicap advantage by being too passive.]

You have exactly he right idea here. I see two options:

i) reduce W by putting pressure on the open left hand side. I would prefer the black extension to C instead. 

ii) attack more directly and threaten to split white in two with a move like A or B. This could get quite messy and I've started a few variations off, but it could work out quite nicely for black.]
;W[co];B[cp]C[He probes I thought an d i just take territory with the corner

(;B[bd]LB[fc:A][ci:B][ck:C]TR[cm][co]SQ[ip][nq]C[weired extension from him ... so  i just go towards the corner in the top left. Should i do A or B?

-----
A is more standard than B16 as a general rule. There are, however, now two white groups that it is possible to put more pressure on right away (triangle and square). Even better, by attacking one you could build the strength/thickness to attack the ohter. As you say, C7 is a weird extension and it is possible to punish it quite severely- B16 is in the wrong direction to do this. 

An extension along the left hand side to B works, but it is possible to put much more pressure on the two white stones than a move at B. An extension all the way to C looks good:

i) puts strong pressure on the triangled white stones and forces White to live in a very tight space.
ii) is a nice distance from C14. You should have no problems if White does something silly like try to split C9 and C14. 
iii) may allow you to attack the two squared white stones whilst 'leaning' on the triangled stones (see variation)

If White does something aggressive like try to split your group (e.g Black C9, White C11), white then has 4 unsettled groups and you will always come out stronger.]
;W[ef];B[ci]TR[cm][co]C[he takes outside i go for profit again.. and start narrowing the space for the triangled group

Not a bad idea at all, but would have been better earlier!. Here, I'd prefer to punish the odd White move at E14 a bit more with a simple move like K16. This would force White to become overconcentrated and gives you a very nice whole board position with the bottom right.]
;W[jd];B[cc]C[He takes the big extension and i go and take the corner. I still have good access to the center and he has very little territory so far..]
;W[dc];B[do]TR[ip][nq]SQ[qn][cp][dp][pp][fq]C[D17 is no threat to me I thougt... so I go and threaten the split on C5-C7 while playing super solid and raising my position

-----

Yep. I like the idea of playing solidly on the left to build the strength to be more aggressive against the two White stones, which now sit very uneasily between two solid black groups. Exactly the right thinking here.]
;W[dn];B[bo];W[cn]LB[kp:A][lq:B];B[fn]C[i get the atari protecting my corner and force him into an empty triangle shape and with f6 i go towards the center...

Yep, or E16 works too and is a bit tighter. You are now nicely wedged between what are becoming one weak and another weakish white group.]
;W[gq]C[Wise move by white.];B[gp]C[I thought the attachment gives me this hane to strengthen my group, allowing a more severe attack on teh C6 group.

;W[bn];B[bp]C[he forces. i protect

This is only necessary if you are trying to kill White- but White seems to have just enough space to keep jumping out. Otherwise, this move is worth practically nothing and it would be much better to play elsewhere.  (a move like Q10 is huge)]

This is alright, though I prefer a bit more pressure with Q8]
;W[pl];B[qg]C[pillar and i just secure the upper right area... maybe a bit overconcentrated..

Possibly a bit overconcentrated, but it does give you some solid territory. The alternative would be a simple move like O17. Or playing elsewhere with a move like Q2.]

Yes, moves like this are hard to deal with. You had built the moyo very nicely, and it now looks like it is ruined.]

[qe:6][of:3][pf:4][qf:7]TR[jf][kg][lh][mi][nj][oj]C[As a general rule, contact plays will strengthen both you and your opponent.. Contact plays are typically used to try and live in a tight spot (e.g look at white's G3 move from much earlier in the game). They are not very effective at all at killing stones in situations like this- it is usually much better to attack from distance. In this case just playing solidly isn't going to secure much territory at all (~10) and leaves your moyo massively reduced, so I attempt to try to enclose white by attacking from distance...

I think white has been a little bit too ambitious. Imagine a 'line' (see triangles) of your influence. A perfect reducing move is (depending on the rest of the board) roughly on this line. White is possibly just too far inside. 

You can then attack from distance to keep white 'inside' this line with a move like O10.

This gets messy and white might just escape. BUT you can then use your new strength to attack the marked white group, for example. This is another example of a leaning attack. The white group on the left hand sie is also not settled yet.]
;W[of];B[og]CR[le][jf]C[p14 should die...

Cross cuts have horrendous amounts of variations, and ideally you need to play them with a good idea of what you are going to do several moves later. In particular, you should be concerned about the two marked stones becoming cut off amidst the carnage, and even struggling to jump out to the left hand side.]

Good. White really shouldn't have let that happen, but you capitalised on it well. You should win the game now.]
;W[hj];B[ji];W[hn];B[gn];W[ho];B[er]C[Very small move. 

This is now a good time for counting (something I don't do enough...). 

Look at the score estimator at this point. All you need to do is keep the two mainwhite areas to a managable size and you have won. This should be easy given that the top white area is very open.]
;W[fs];B[es];W[gr]C[getting some safety for black here.. now i should just get my middle group alive or attack towards the bottom ..

Black was already safe :)]
(;B[he]LB[ke:C][gh:D][hh:A][hi:B]C[any of those were probably better..

Yes :) This move isfar too risky.

I suspect that if you had counted correcrly at this stage, you wouldn't have taken a  risk like this. Instead, without knowing a rough estimate of the score, white looks intimidating along the top. Playing very simply and conservatively works fine (see variation).]

;W[nm];B[cb];W[da];B[ca];W[ea]C[Overall, you started the game well and I felt like you went into the game with the right attitude for a handicap game- play solidly but not too passively. You did well to take a lead in the game, but were not quite ruthless enough at punishing white's mistakes and then made a few silly mistakes. 

i) Counting is a chore, but very important. You would not have tried to reduce white quite so severely if you knew that you had a solid lead. Perhaps some longer games (30:00+) may help you to do this. 

ii) White often had some unsettled/weak groups, as will always happen in a handicap game. When there are multiple unsettled groups, a good strategy is to 'lean' on one group in order to attack the other. At the 8k level, players will not be leaving obviously weak groups all over the board as happens at the DDK level. So you need to develop some more subtle strategies.
 -There were a few times a deliberate strategy of 'leaning' would be useful- see around move 10, for example
 -Remember that you do not need to kill a group in order to profit from its weakness- you can force a group to be overconcentrated, or develop thickness that can be used to attack another group or secure territory elsewhere.

I would recommend just to keep playing games in order to keep improving at this stage. Reviewing games yourself is good; I don't think there is any need to 'learn' joseki, but perhaps use online joseki dictionaries to see what you could have done instead. Good luck!]
