Summary:

1. I do not recommend early corner invasions (move 9)
2. Protect your key stones, don't leave cuts (move 5, 29, 54)
3. Contact play is usually not good (move 43, 51)
4. Give up stones when there is no hope (moves 21, 57, 61, 119, 123)
5. Keep an eye on opponent's moyos, focus on them when they are really huge (moves 29, 92)]
