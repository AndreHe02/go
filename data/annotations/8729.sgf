C[I am a 4k on KGS and this is against a 4k. I am playing as white.
S*: Hi. I'm Shane - 2d on KGS and I'll be commenting this game. Most of the mistakes happened in the opening. White got in a difficult position with not enough territory and no large moyo. I included most of my comments before move 50 which cover chinese fuseki issues. There are some middle game comments, too.

I left comments explaining what I was thinking at various points. Don't feel like you have to respond to all of them.
S*: I might not, you asked a bunch of questions, but I'll try to explain most of them.

Thank you very much for taking the time to review. I hope you find the game interesting.
S*: Thank you.

I will use the S*: comment if we are both typing on the same move number.]

[pg:C][cj:G][pj:F][qj:E][qn:J][jp:I]C[I recognized this as the chinese fuseki and remembered from a lecture that I should not try to approach the corner around P16 so I don't get pincered.

S*: Yes. This discourages an IMMEDIATE approach. Timing is important, to see why look as variations A and B. 

S*: The 'wrong side' approach on the right side is a very special strategy. Moving at D is territorial style, while moving at C is a more moyo and influence style. Again, a reason that chinese fuseki is different than old style fusekis.

Your move at E or F is fine if you plan to play a game where you want to limit the possibilities of the 3-4 stone. Which would mean you hope to invade the left easier because he is high at the D16 stone. Playing at E or F generally leads to managing a right side invasion (as your fuseki continued)

Plays at G or H look to seek to prevent a moyo with a 4-4 stone, with intentions of limiting the right later with an approach at A or B once the time is right with white support. 

I is also possible for a moyo vs moyo strategy. Perhaps banking on komi.

In short there are so many possibilities now. Also J!  K is not advised for a similar reason to A or B.]
(;W[qj]TR[oc][qc][nd][od]C[S*: Your strategy is patient, limiting the more territorial side of his chinese formation while retaining the possibility of approach or an invasion in the middle game. You won't find many pros who play this because it isn't active enough, but there is no theoretical problem here, and with komi there is no problem.]
;B[dj]LB[cc:E][fc:C][od:D][cm:B][jp:A]C[S*: His move is natural and makes a nice five space extension, developing both sides of his 4-4 stone, and making a nice high/low balence with L17.

S*: You played A, which was a natrual move, but you said you regretted it. It is the last big point, and nothing is very urgent yet, so it seems fine. But it shows a style of moyo building, planning on invading later, or inviting black to invade first. 

If you don't like this strategy, B is a defensive way that would entice black to split below A. C

C is a normal invasion point because it is the wider of the two black extensions. This would be possible and has been played in professional games. It seeks to stop the moyo before it gets too large by taking the initiative. 

D would also isolate the R16 stone and white would have less to fear because some support exists on the right.

Again, there are many ways to play. In a similar fuseki in a pro game E has even been played.]
;W[jp]LB[cn:B][qq:A]C[I regretted this move right after I played it because it seems hard for white to keep up with black in a moyo building game. Yet I was scared to jump into black's area because it all seemed liked a chinese trap.

S*: So far, neither player has played an incorrect move. This though is very patient. It extends mutually both of your hoshi stones.

Black plays A which is maybe early, but a correct move for a local reduction. A move at B might be better.]
(;B[qq]C[This invasion seemed too early for black so I was happy to build influence.

S*: It is maybe a little early, but it is the correct point for a local reduction of white's extensions off the Q4 stone.
It can't be said to be bad, but perhaps early. In my opinion, White should seek to gain sente so as to make black's invasion early.]
;W[pq]C[S*: Good move. This way of blocking is best for white because it preserves the more devopable bottom side where white has two high stone.]
;B[qp]LB[qn:A][qo:B]C[Now, white can seek sente by playing A instead of the usual move of B (actual game).]
(;W[qo];B[ro]LB[qn:A][rn:B][rp:C]C[Your move at A was consistant with your strategy, but seems like playing there is merely going along with black's strategy, but it still has the virtue of being solid, consistant and patient.

Trying to vary with Double hane at B is possible and can be used for territory, but I would not like to play like this.

C, a tricky hamete, has been used by pros some but rarely and is difficult to answer. It is worth considering to throw a curve ball into black's plan so as to not go along with his wishes. Before playing it, you must have the ladder and might want to read deeply and think about different variations. Here there is no ladder for this reason a simple move at A is best, too!]
(;W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nq]LB[cn:B][cq:A]C[S*: Here is a big turning point in the game. 

Black plays A, but this is too much invasion at this point. Playing at B is a mutually good point that works with all the black stones. And opens many possibile developments for B.]
(;B[cq]C[Black is now invading too much. Two immediate variations take the territory, but neglects developing his own position.]
;W[cp]TR[jp][pp][nq][pq][or]C[I wasn't sure if this was the right direction. I tried the other direction in a similar game except D10 wasn't there. Although I won, it seemed risky to gamble the game on keeping black out of just one big moyo on the bottom.

S*: No this isn't a good direction. White invested the marked stones for territorial framework, but blocking this was lets black slip in under. After black makes a mistake, white follows with a mistake, which in turn makes black's bad move a good one. That is what makes go so difficult. When opponents make questionable moves, if we answer incorrectly, then it will become a good move.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]
LB[cg:A][ji:B]TR[cp][dp]C[S*: Now black is in a position for an easy game. He has two secure corners, sente, and a formation at the top of the board. Blocking this way with the two marked stones set white back in territorial possibilities. His walls are pointing the wrong way.

Black next moves at A, but this moves is slack as it doesn't affect white's position and works only with one side of black's formation. 

I believe that the best move is B, which begins to seal white's fate. It is a move serving multiple purposes. (see variation).]
(;B[cg]C[With this result, I wanted to be able to use my influence towards the left as well as the bottom. However, black had sente and I felt that he foiled my plan with this move.

S*: White has a difficult game. With very little territory and it is difficult to figure out how the use the walls. Black has no weak groups and the walls cannot be made into territory without many moves in a row. I might move into the right corner first looking to find a way for a fight to happen on the top. White must try something. Moving into the upper left where black is stronger is likely to make settling more difficult for white, and fighting is more difficult because that is where black is strongest.]
(;W[db]LB[cc:a][fc:b]TR[hc][kc]C[I also considered playing at A or B, but I didn't want to get blocked into the corner with black having influence working with his stones. With B, it seemed that black could still force me to take the corner with a pincer that also sets up a two space extension at the triangles. With this move, I aimed to invade black's corner and side and escape towards my influence.

S*: Yes, but "escaping" to your thickness is not a good idea. First, you hope that you can some how manage to make a center moyo. Having black chase you there will reduce that possibility. Next, taking the corner in any variation leads to points. White despartly needs points. White cannot win this game without causing complications. White must seek a clever way to make a fight. Coming into this side where black is strong makes it difficult to make a good fight. The upper right is better place to start a fight and hope that it naturally neutralizes the top side.]

(;W[gb]LB[fb:a]C[S*: White should just play A.];B[ib];W[hf]
LB[nc:a]C[Although I was nervous about not having much solid territory at this point my position seemed playable.

S*: Actually, black has an easy game if follows up with A. It takes white too many moves to make territory in the center.]
;B[fd]LB[mc:a]C[S*. This move is slow by B. White must make complications if he wants to turn the tables. If white answers, black will have an easy game. White should maybe try an attack around A. If a fight comes into the center, white's presence will be useful. Thereby making his walls not a waste.]
;W[ge];B[ic]C[I was happy that black made these two moves. They seemed slow to me.

S*: Yes, but you answered too with a slow move. But you get the attack that you need.]
;W[mc]TR[gb][gc][hc][ge][hf]C[I decided to put some pressure on black's weak group while also preparing to enter the top right. Though my triangle group is still weak, my influence gave me confidence and I wanted to attack before black had a chance to fortify.

S*: Yes, making a fight is white's only option. Black just needed to keep from having a weak group to make a won game.]
;B[oc];W[od]C[I considered a one space jump to the center to attack the middle group but with this corner enclosure, the corner now seemed like the stronger group. I planned to attach to build up strength before attacking.

S*: Not a bad idea. But i wouldn't do this because later you might be able to play deeper in the corner once the right side develops. This helps black become a little too solid in the corner.]
;B[nc]TR[od]C[S*: This is a ' hard headed' move. Black tries to resist and is removing his own liberties here. White can discard the marked stone. If black takes it greedily, then the top group for B becomes too weak.]
(;W[nd]C[S*: This move is what black wanted. White now has a cutting point, and black can bridge under at N18.]
(;B[pd]C[S*: mistake by B. see var];W[md]C[S*: correct response]
;B[ke];W[kg]LB[lg:a]C[S*: Feels like attacking at A is better because helps topside four.]
;B[lf];W[ng];B[lg];W[kh]C[S*: This is the type of fight white is hoping for.]
;B[ie];W[jd]C[My attack does not seem to be going so well.

S*: This move is too soon or not needed at all. First, before striking vital points it is often good to seal him in. If he runs out and connects or makes more eyes, striking a vital point doesn't work.

Next, this doesn't seem like a vital point. Would black play here if white decides to play elsewhere? Problably not, so you can save it.

Most importantly, It ends gote because you must protect a cut.]

C[I knew I should have just played G19 for my last move!

S*: Its okay. nothing too tragic.];W[if]C[I cut my losses with those three stones on top.

S*: Those stones keep your opponent separated and are not just worth a couple points, but the whole attack. White doesn't have enough territory to win. He must keep up the attack.]
;B[ga];W[kf];B[le];W[lh];B[je]C[S*: This move is slow and only saves a few points. Black misses a chance to reduce center.]
;W[ek]C[At this point, I think my only best strategy is to build up a large territory in the middle.

S*: Good idea.];B[dk];W[el];B[ph];W[pf]TR[mc][md][nd][od]C[I wondered if this was too greedy, but I wanted to keep a connection to my four triangle stones and figured I could still sacrifice later if I had to.]

C[Getting life on top seemed like a good recovery.];B[mj];W[mg]
LB[nh:a]C[This move looks pretty bad in hindsight. I was foolishly thinking black might try to stop me from connecting to the top using aji from the three stones.

Around this time, my main time (25 min) was also running out. Everybody online plays so fast! I usually enter byo-yomi in the middle game. I like to take my time to think through the fuseki and early middle game. Often enough, I can establish some clear advantages and just play solid moves in byo yomi. Other times, it doesn't work out so well.

S*: If black moves at A he is connected and can win.];B[li]

TR[pe][qe][pf]C[It looks like black did not take advantage of my mistake. Now, I should be able to connect at A or use the 1-5 sequence to connect at top using aji from the triangle stones.

Now I try to kill the invading stones.

S*: Black getting separated gives you a chance, but seems hard to find a direct way to kill.]
;W[ml]LB[kk:b][ll:a]TR[ge][he][hf][if][kf][kg][kh][lh]C[I try to separate black, but now I realize this just gives him a target. Maybe treatening to separate with A is better? Or removing eye space with B? I'd like to go out further and ensure my triangle stones get connected, but I don't want to give black too much space.

S*: This direct normally won't work. Black will try to sacrifice a little, but if he survives the ajority of his group, he should be fine.]

(;W[oc]C[S*: It primarily discourages the immediate low approach. In history, low approach was favored because it was the most territorially valuable. In this fuseki the only asymmetrical corner point is the upper right, so it would be natrual according to go theory to want to approach the only assymetrical point at the most teritorially valuable point.

But this is why chinese fuseki is different than older enclosure based fusekis, hence its development from modern fuseki. 

To punish this low approach, black would make white heavy useing the pincer to maximum effectivness.]
;B[pc]C[*S: White would become heavy. This type of diagnol play which is normally bad here is appropriate because of the L17 pincer in place.]
;W[od];B[pf]C[Black now would attack white.];W[le]C[S*: White would likely try to move out lightly, but in doing so black will strengthen the upper side around his high 4-4 stone, and white would still have to eventually settle his stones more. That is why this fuseki would favor black.]
)
(;W[od]LB[pc:B][pf:A]C[S*: Approaching high is one way for white to approach here. It is not as bad as the low approach in chinese fuseki, but it also has a feeling of prematurity.

S*: Black would continue to attack with A normally while defending. Black B is a semi trap, hoping white misplays.]
;B[pf]LB[qc:A][ld:C][of:B][ph:D]C[S*: Moving at A is natural, but there have also been experiments with B, C , and D.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc]LB[kd:B][rd:A]C[The exchange could be expected, but white can also cross cut if black is high at B.]
;B[rb]LB[re:A]C[S*: Decending here leaves more aji than playing solid at A, but this move is to keep white from being able to settle easily.]
;W[mc]C[S*: White is more settled than when he approaches low, but he is still crammed and black can aim to seal him in later, forcing him to make eyes. This too is not so good. This is the main reason that approaching the upper right corner first is avoided.]
)
(;W[qf]C[S*: This approach would be unthinkable to ancient go, because white gives black a solid enclosure which is considered more valuable than the two space exension on the right side. But modern go isn't so rigid, and playing like this is consistant with the direction of the Q4 stone.]
;B[od];W[qi]C[S*: After extending to 8, black is most likely to keep white from developing both sides of the Q4 stone.]
;B[jq];W[lq]C[Although, black has gotten a strong corner enclosure in the upper right, white has also developed naturally. That is why this wrong side approach can be used in Chinese Fuseki.]
)
(;W[pg];B[od];W[pj]C[S*: White can also use this strategy if he/she likes high positions.]
