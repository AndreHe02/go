Black should win with 3.5 points. 
This was very close. 

You played a good game. You play mostly solid moves, which is definitely good. With secure groups you can attack freely. But you have to do so. 
Move 101 was the most questionable. You must not make it so easy for white. You should be lucky, that you had the chance to sacrifice this seven almost dead stones to get a big top area. 
To review this game was fun for me. Thank you both. It was an interesting fight.
Enjoy your games.
