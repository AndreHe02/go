C[Hi, I am Tuomas. A bit inactive 4 kuy from Finland. I hope you enjoy my review.

But let me warn you first, I do not like making variations. In my experience variations made my stronger players don't usually help that much. Instead I try to point important things to consider.

In a game you need to calculate the variation on your own anyway. So you can as well start practicinsg now. Have fun!]
FG[259:]PM[2];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[jj]LB[fd:1][fp:2]C[I ama not very familiar with tengen fuseki. However it seems to me that in this kind of fuseki black aims to make huge triangle of influence for either upper right or lower rigth corner. So black aims to play next to 1 or 2.]
;W[jp];B[jd]LB[fd:1]C[Here my instincts insist that black should go further towards 1. In influence based fuseki main thing is to get lot of it and have agressive and flexible mind set.]
;W[qj]LB[pi:1]TR[jd][pd][jj]C[Here playing low like this is dangerous. Later in the game black may be able to play shoulder hit from 1 which can make marked black stones very effective. If white plays on the fourth line similar shoulder hit is not anywhere as tempting.

Obviously this is something that black should try to use during the game.]
;B[dj]C[Lets stop here. After this move the fuseki is done. The situation is almost symmetric, only exceptions are the black stone at the center, in tengen and one white third row stone.

Please remember this situation and check the variation.]
(;W[dh]LB[cf:1][qq:2]C[This is too wide play, white leaves all the doors open for black. With stone in the tengen and support from his fourth line stones all over board, black can play very aggressively here.

In this kind of situtation it is usually best to play tight game and take profit. So just close the corner with 1 instead.

Then black needs to do something for the bottom right stone because if white gets to play invasion at 2, his stone at the corner is complately wasted.]
;B[cf]C[Agressive play but with tengen black can probably afford it.]
;W[fc]LB[df:2][ef:1]TR[jd][cf][dj][jj]C[No question about it, black should next play at 1 and cut white groups. See how it would work with marked stones and activate the tengen.

For white the only move is really playing at 2 to connect the stones.]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[ef];B[ch]LB[dc:2][de:1][dh:3]C[White stones are somewhat connected and black got some points from side. Sounds fair. White group works against the black stone at center so not too disastrous result. Still I think black won this corner, it was because white played too thin with his stone 3.

At some point black can play 1 and 2 to get more points from corner.]
;W[hb]LB[hd:2][fg:3][cn:1]C[This is not very good move. It doesn't protect white or attack black much. If white wants to defend this group 2 or 3 would be better.

White should build his bottom left corner with 1 before black comes there.]
;B[lc]LB[qg:1][pi:2]C[This is not a corner enclosure, and it is not an attack, and it does not build territory as long as right side is unsettled.

Play 1 to build upper right corner and haras the white stone. Now one could even consider the shoulder hit against it with 2.]
;W[cm]LB[cn:1]C[With so much black influence around it is probably better to play tigh corner enclosure with 1.

I usually advice everyone to avoid this long corner enclosure. It makes the corner defense so much harder and gives so little extra.]
;B[fq]TR[jp]C[One common answer againt this black stone is pincer with marked white stone. But in this situation with so much black influence around it would not be a good idea. But now white gets to play one move more so...]
;W[hq]LB[mp:2][eq:1]C[This leaves the corner way too open. White could touch black stone by playing 1 and then expand this weak group with 2. Then black would have to defend his corner at right bottom and he would have heavy group at bottom left.]
;B[cq]LB[cm:3][dp:1][cq:4][fq:2]C[Please check the joseki of 1-2-3-4 from Kogo's joseki dictionary.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co]LB[do:1][np:2][qq:3]C[Here white should play 1 and after black lives in the corner he can attack the black stone at bottom left corner with 2 or 3. As the game proceeds keep eye on this cut at 1 and see how much trouble it causes for white.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[cn];B[fo];W[bn];B[bp]C[Black is alive.]
;W[fr];B[mq]LB[qg:1][qm:2][nq:3]C[Here again I would advice against this wide corner enclosure. Tight one is safer and after that the bottom side is not interesting anymore.

One alternative would be inducing the corner enclosure at bottom corner. This can be done by teasing the white stone at right side with black stone somewhere around 1. White defends with 2 and that induces the black defense with 3.]
;W[qm];B[qn]LB[pi:1]C[This was probably the last chance for black to play shoulder hit at 1.]
;W[qg];B[qf]LB[qe:2][qo:1]TR[qn]C[Touching opponent stones like black did with his marked stones is usually a bad idea. Just playing 1 and 2 would most likely work better. Observe how these two moves will allow white to build points in this side.]
;W[og]TR[jj]C[After this the black stone at the center is not likely to make any significant points. It did give indirect support for few situations but it has been so fat mostly unused.]
;B[jr]LB[qq:1]C[For exercise, study what happens if white plays a corner invasion at 1?]
;W[gq]C[Is this really necessary?];B[do]LB[em:1]C[This starts the running battle between two weak white groups and one weak black group. White is supported by sides where he has possibility to make eyes, black is supported by open center and his stone that gives him one step advantage.

What if black just plays 1 and starts to enclose points from center? Then white would have chance to make points from sides but there are not that many points left anymore.]

;B[kl];W[ll];B[kk];W[nj];B[lj]C[This is where the running battle ends. It is a tie as expected, it is rare to be able to actually catch something.

Side effects are more important in running battle. Here white secured the upper left corner and made points in right side. Black destroyed white areas from bottom left corner.

To improve your skills, I would advice avoiding this kind of battle plans. You wont learn much from this kind of fight. Try to find a more elegant way, it pays off in the long run.]
;W[ne]LB[qc:1]C[This move doesn't do much. The black group at the center is already fairly safe and there are no points here. This basically just forces black to seal is upper right corner.

What would happen if white made the corner invasion at 1 instead?]

;B[pm];W[pl];B[mn];W[ln]LB[mo:1]C[Here white can first play 1 before he has to connect.]
;B[mo];W[ao];B[ds]LB[ar:1]C[Is it alive now? The safe way to liveif you don't bother to take risks is usually to play something like 1.]

[kr][lr][mr][nr][as][bs][cs][ls][ms][ns]C[One white stone seems to be missing from G2.

CGoban seems to have some trouble in counting the score of this game. But black victory remains undisputed, even the seki from bottom left corner is not enough for white.

So what went wrong? I would say that black won the game because white failed to profit from the second and third stone that he played.

For white I would recommend studying good shapes, too many times black was able to break through from his lines.

For black I would recommend studying direction of the play. Influence based openings are all about that.]

The first thing to compare is the difference between upper right and lower left.  We can see that black has been able to profit much more from his influence than white. One could even claim that the game was decided because white failed to profit from his two stones at bottom left.

Next thing to note is the center. Black has 12 points of area there. That doesn't sound so much, so lets see if that hoshi stone was wroth playing so early.

The third and last point from this exercise is side groups. Both players made significant territory from their side stone, which basically was squeezed by two hostile hoshi stones at the corners.]
