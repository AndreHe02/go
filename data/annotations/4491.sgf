-- Hello Klaus, hello talw!
My name is Sven, I´m about 13 kyu on KGS and I´ll try to clear things up a bit for you. My comments are preceeded by "--" so as to be spotted more easily by you. If something remains unclear or you have additional questions, do not hesitate to write me!

-- Basically, both Black and White played rather peacefully without making risky and unnecessary attacks. On the other hand, White - being at a disadvantage by playing second in the beginning - should have made more forceful attacks, instead of letting himself be forced by Black, who strategically led this game.
As concerns reading out positions, both players made some mistakes, but this is just a matter of practice. Although the two oppenents rightly applied the rule of playing the corners first, then the sides and lastly the center, both should try to look for big moves in the center before making small endgame moves near the border of the board.  Finally remember that a stone at the 4-4-point does not secure the corner, but often prompts the enemy to invade (mostly at 3-3).]
;B[dk];W[kj];B[cd];W[jd];B[gk]LB[ik:A]C[-- perhaps a bit timid of Black here to secure his position on the lower side. White can still enclose the corner by playing at A.]
;W[gc]
(;B[kk]C[-- Black lets himself get closed in willingly, while White gets strong on the outside. Better take back one step, and press White to the right side, conceding some territory, but building influence towards the center (see variations).]
;W[jk];B[kl];W[jl];B[jm]
(;W[lk]C[-- White leaves a lot of cutting points here, and Black can still connect underneath to the stones on the left... (see variation)

Probably better descend to the edge at A - Black then still cannot live in the corner but by connecting to the left, and cannot make trouble on the right side.]

(;B[ll]
(;W[im]
(;B[km]TR[jj][lj][il]C[-- Black robs himself of the last liberties... White has played too aggressive here and has a lot of cutting points (X) - this is where Black must play... (see variation)]
;W[ml];B[ch];W[jg];B[il]LB[ec:A][gh:B]C[-- Why force White to take the Black prisoners? There´s still much more territory to gain at other parts of the board!]
;W[lm];B[hm];W[jm]LB[dc:A][gg:B]C[-- No! Rescuing the Stone on J1 gives White just a few points. Better play on the big points.]
;B[hl]C[-- Although White has connected here, Black himself must make a connection here - and White has "sente" to play on really important places.]
;W[hf]LB[dc:A][gg:B]C[-- Well...too close to the other white stones. Better A or B.]
;B[gg]C[-- Good! Limit White´s expansion in the center.];W[ec]

(;B[cc]TR[dc]C[Trollo: I know that feeling.  Next time we play that will be my part :-)
talw: hehe

-- Black is afraid of his opponent - on D11 would have been fine, too.]

(;W[fe]SQ[gg]C[-- White is afraid of his contrahent, too :-) A little further will not only yield more territory, but threaten to cut off the marked black stone, either!]
;B[ee];W[ff];B[gf]
(;W[ge]TR[gf][gg]C[-- Black two center stones are very weak and still have to be connected to the outside - so White must attack here, not defend!]
;B[he];W[if];B[hd];W[hc]
(;B[je]LB[kc:A][fh:C][ii:B]C[-- Normally, no real chance for Black to live here. Black should play on the outside or invade at 3-3 straight away.]
;W[id];B[ie]
(;W[ke]TR[kd]C[-- Not good by White to make Black cut. It´s not necessary to kill enemy stones at once - just prevent them from getting two eyes!]
;B[kd];W[gd]
(;B[hh]LB[jc:A]C[-- Black should take the opportunity first and take the upper right corner!]
;W[ih];B[hg];W[ig];B[ij];W[jj];B[ji];W[ki];B[kf]LB[jc:A]C[-- As mentioned before, Black on A! (see move 45)]

(;W[jf]LB[le:A]C[-- Better on M9, so Black has no room towards the bottom]
;B[le];W[je];B[ld];W[lf];B[ii]C[-- not necessary. Black should play on in the corner.]

(;W[jh]LB[kc:A][df:B]C[-- This move is only worth 1 point, and Black need not answer!

Instead White should kill the Black stones on the right, or at least invade further to the left.]

(;B[jc]LB[kb:A]C[-- I think, Black can live in the corner, though Black should probably start at A.]

(;W[jb]LB[kb:A]C[-- White on A is promising to make more trouble... I think, the best Black can get then is a seki (see variation)]

(;B[kc]LB[kb:A]C[-- This way Black lets his enemy destroy his eye-space. On A!]
;W[kb]C[-- Good. Black is dead, if played correctly.];B[lb]
;W[la];B[mb]
(;W[me]LB[ib:B][ic:A]C[-- No! White can play this later. First connect at A or better B.]
;B[ib]C[-- Good! Now Black is definitely alive.];W[ic];B[ja]
;W[hb];B[ka];W[kg]C[Trollo: cool !!
talw: what's cool?

-- Why capture this Black stone? 0 points, and "sente" goes to Black!]
;B[ha]C[Trollo: YOu, winning the corner. I didn't thought that s possible :-)]
;W[ga]C[talw: me neither
talw: i just play and try out things ;)
Trollo: best thing to do ;-)];B[ia]C[talw: i guess...];W[ed]
LB[df:A]C[talw: But I want to understand what I'm doing :/

-- White  better on A, as shown before!];B[de]C[Trollo: me too, but that seems to be a long way...]
;W[da]C[talw: i guess];B[ca];W[ea]C[Trollo: may i set you on my "Friends" list?]
;B[fg]C[talw: of course :D
talw: I'll set you too


-- Finally! Now White can only make few more points in the center.]
;W[ef]
(;B[df]LB[dg:A]C[Trollo: thank you !! :-))


-- Wrong. Must be on A, if White shall not invade on and on...]

(;W[md]C[talw: thank YOU :)

-- White on the other hand should have invade the center here (see previous moves)]
