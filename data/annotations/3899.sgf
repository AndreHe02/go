C[crux: Hi, my name is Bernd Schmidt; I play around 2 dan at the local club.  Hope this review is useful.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[jp];B[lq]LB[cn:A][fc:B][jd:D]
[lp:C]C[crux: It's early enough in the game to ask a database about normal continuations.  Your move seems playable, but A and B are the common ones.  C and D are also seen, but not quite as often.]
;W[lo];B[np];W[nn];B[qn];W[jd];B[ck];W[di];B[cn];W[cp];B[en]
;W[fq];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[cf];B[hd];W[nc];B[pf];W[ic];B[de]
;W[ce];B[ed];W[dc]TR[ce][de][ed]C[crux: The last 4 moves (marked) seem to have helped White a lot more than Black.  The corner is now 100% secure.  Don't play in a way that helps your opponent.]
;B[je];W[id];B[ie];W[hc];B[ge];W[kd]LB[fb:A]C[w should continue push at G17?

crux: Black could respond at A (F18), and it's not clear to me what White would have gained.]
;B[gc]C[crux: Very slow.];W[ee]C[crux: Also very slow.  The single stone isn't important.]
;B[fe]TR[de][ee]C[crux: Another slow move.  Neither of the two marked stones is important.]

(;B[do]LB[dl:A]C[crux: The shape point is at A.];W[co];B[eo]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[dk]TR[do][en][eo]C[crux: White's stones are out of trouble, and the marked black ones are weak.]
;B[gn];W[hp];B[fl];W[fk]C[crux: I'm not convinced this is the correct direction of attack for White.  White seems to be filling neutral points in the sequence that follows.]

(;B[kj]LB[kh:A]C[b should play at least at N9, which can protect both sides. Am I right?

crux: I'm not sure what you mean by "both sides".  I think I might prefer the simple and clear move at A.]
;W[ng];B[mf]TR[qg]C[crux: Why peep?  This looks like aji-keshi to me.  Given that the marked point becomes important later, you don't really want to strengthen White unnecessarily on this side.]

(;W[mi]C[w should continue to push at L9? But w has weakness too.

crux: What do you hope to accomplish by pushing?]
(;B[kk];W[kg];B[kh];W[kf];B[jf];W[ke];B[mh];W[nh];B[li];W[oi]
;B[jr];W[hr];B[jm]C[crux: Small.  White should give up one or two stones and wreck the upper right.]
;W[im];B[mn]LB[ri:A]C[crux: A move around A might be larger.]

(;B[nh]C[crux: Black could try this in an attempt to capture.  I'm not sure how it's going to turn out; White has a few resources but Black can probably make a credible attempt at killing.]

(;W[kk];B[jk]C[crux: This only seems to lose a liberty for White.]

(;B[kk]C[crux: Simply here?]))
(;B[rk]C[crux: Simply here might be best.  White needs another move, so Black has sente.  White did manage to reduce the side a bite, but the damage is not as bad as in the game.]

(;B[pk]TR[qe][qg]C[crux: If you think you can kill the stone, this may be best.  But Black has some weaknesses at the marked points.]

(;B[mk]TR[jh]C[crux: To me, this feels like a too vague move.  There is still aji at the triangled cutting point, and it's not clear to me what other purpose this move is trying to serve.]
