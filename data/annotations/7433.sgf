C[* hi. my comments are preceded by an asterisk. sometimes I inserted variations of what "could have been". these are not necessarily better -- well, sometimes they are --, but only alternatives.

* some generic comments:
* you had a far superior game up to move 63, with huge moyo on top, despite playing low for about the first 12 moves
* most of your mistakes involved fights that sometimes you yourself started but were afraid to follow through
* you often start a fight only to draw back into defense when your opponent takes it up.
* M4 was open for an invasion until about move 139. after that point if was probably hopeless to start an attack there. you have had many occasions to invade there instead of smaller moves you made.

* conclusion: your building of the moyo was nice. your fighting needs to be more aggressive and you should know when something is hopeless. if it's saving a stone or a few stones: try to use them in an indirect way, see variation after move 143. if it's fending off an invasion, sometimes give a little and save a lot instead of trying to save everything and losing a lot.
(I realize it's hard tell between "a little" and "a lot".)

* Pls let me know if you have any further questions. You can reach me at gbohus@yahoo.com]

C[I'm not sure if this is an advantageous opening.  it looks fairly even for me... but should I have taken a 2nd corner?

* you have taken a low position on both sides, that's probably not so great. but you are right, it's probably still fairly even.]
;B[np];W[qk]C[* still playing low];B[jp];W[ic]C[* low again]
;B[qf]C[I felt this stone could be punished, but I didn't know how to go about it.

* well it's not that close to anything you already "own", so there is not much to punish. you can push it around of course and gain territory in the process.]
;W[qh]C[* low again. I probably would have tried P15 which would work well with J17.]
;B[qc];W[pd];B[qd];W[pe];B[pb];W[ob];B[pa]C[I felt this gave me sente so I abandoned it and tenuki'd somewhere else.

* yes, although this did come back to haunt you. nevertheless, you did end up with a good position. your wall is facing your own stone on J17, not too close.]

(;W[do]C[* not so important.];B[bp]C[Ok. this is a very familiar pattern with most of my games. I always finish the first part feeling like I'm really really ahead... tons and tons of influence.. no weak group to speak off... but then somehow.. it all falls apart.

Strategy wise, how do you correct this and what exercises do you think will help?

and in your estimation, white's position here is really ahead? or are none of this really settled at this point and white is really weak?

* you are right on several counts. white's influence is great but much of it is not settled. I'm not talking about living, that shouldn't be a problem, but turning influence into territory is not always easy. still, you are ahead with a huge moyo on top and black's bottom in not unassailable either.]
