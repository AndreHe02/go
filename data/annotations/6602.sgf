C[Hello!

Thanks for reviewing this game!

 I hope you can give me some general advices about the direction of play and some tactical & strategical improvements.

 Greetings, Nikolai];B[cd];W[pp];B[dp];W[od];B[ed];W[cj];B[ch]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[en]C[Is this move all right?  or maybe better b4? or e10?

B: After the exchange B4/Black C3 you still need a move like E5. I think E5 is good.]
;B[dj]C[this looks a little agressive...

B: It helps you strengthening your stones. Bad move by black

By the way: Attaching move look like agressive moves, but they are usually not really attacking moves. The strengten boths sides. Just assume you answer C9. Then you see: No attack possible anymore. The real attacking moves come from a certain distance.]
;W[dk];B[ej];W[bk]C[how was my reaction?

B: I dont like this move. C11 is better. C11 also defends the cut at D9.]
;B[pn];W[hq]C[should I better respond to q6?

B: Your move is fine.];B[hp];W[ip];B[gq];W[ho];B[gp];W[np]C[ i was not really satified with this outcome...looks like a huge weakness around l4

B: Only if you consider the lower right side as your territory you think of a weakness. The white stones H5, J4 and H3 are light.]
;B[ek];W[cq];B[dl];W[cp];B[fn];W[em];B[ck];W[eo];B[dq];W[hn]
C[B: A move like G6 (or G7) is better. Your move is the wrong direction. You are driving black out towards other black stones]
;B[gn];W[jq]C[now it is stronger - but what do you think about the left side?

B: blacks left side is big. But you will get a lot of the right side. So everything is fine]
;B[fl];W[pk]C[seems like a good timing

B: Yes, good move.];B[nn];W[lo]C[still wanted to protect... necessary?

B: No. You spent so many moves to make your l"light stones" strong. You should omit this one and play 09 attacking an building a moyo]
;B[qk];W[qj];B[ql];W[pj];B[pe];W[pd];B[qe];W[qd];B[qh];W[oh]
C[i was happy with it until here! justified? ^^

B: wrong direction. Play N8 instead. Because of the black move P15 (which you are inviting) you are not connecting to the upper side.]
;B[oe]C[If black presses you must answer! Even if your middle right side stones become weak. They will keep Aji. The difference who plays O16 is to big. There is an entire chapter "the stones go walking" in the book "The fundamentals of Go" with the only theme that in a situation like that you must play O14 or even better O15]
;W[om];B[pb]C[B: very bad move by black. He gives you another oportunity to play O16.]
;W[ob]C[B: No! O16. Tis move creates all the trouble you are going to have. Black O16 will leave you with a terrible form.]
;B[rd]C[B: Here black gives you one more chance to play O15. Let him have the corner if he wants.]
;W[rc];B[nd]C[B: finally the crucial move! Black has locally  got the advantage now.]
;W[nc]C[blacks play seemed again too aggressive to me...

B: No. Turning on both sides of your three stones are strong moves.]
;B[on];W[qo];B[re];W[md];B[ne]
(;W[gc]C[whi felt like a big mistake. i should have attaked the lowe group in order to solidify my weks middle group...

B: In addition you are extending from a group in trouble. Not a good idea.]
;B[nm];W[ol];B[ln];W[ko];B[ll]C[saved - and white has to watch out now]
;W[mk];B[ic]C[black totally took over initiative - and white managed to place another weak stone on g17. this one only brouht trouble. turned the game

B: Right. But I would still say the main turning point was the question who gets O16]
;W[lk];B[lc];W[mc];B[ie];W[kl]C[black ignores to oftern, so white can attack again]
;B[km];W[ml];B[jm];W[mm];B[mn];W[hm];B[jl];W[lm];B[kn];W[jk]
;B[il];W[hl];B[hk]C[B: Looks like a losing move by black.
Very silly. (Time pressure?)];W[ik];B[io];W[in];B[mp];W[mo]
;B[no];W[nq];B[qn]
(;W[ro]C[B: Wrong direction. S10 looks stronger.];B[rj];W[ri]
;B[sj];W[si];B[rl];W[qi];B[rn];W[sm];B[sn];W[sk];B[rk];W[mf]
C[now i have to go on the other weak black goup. how to attack best?

B: Make a leaning attack. Lean with M16 on the black stones to attack later. This also strengthens your own weak group.]
;B[me];W[le];B[ng];W[mg];B[nh];W[oi];B[mh];W[lh];B[li];W[kh]
;B[mj];W[ni];B[rb];W[qc]C[Very bad form for white. The reason are the two earlier turning moves S16 and O16 by black]
;B[sc];W[qb]C[B: Only M16 (instead of R18) can help now. you are taking away your own liberty. Black lives anyway now.]
;B[qa];W[ra];B[ld];W[ke];B[sa];W[oc];B[mb]C[really messed up here]
;W[kb];B[oa];W[kc];B[nb];W[ge];B[hf];W[gf];B[hg];W[gg];B[hh]
;W[hb];B[hj]C[bad tenuki?
B: Yes! very bad. This move brings you back into the game. Very strange. Black saves a cutting stone which lost all its importance and which was not attacked anyway.

Thanks a lot for your review!! :)])
(;B[cr]C[B: better]))
(;W[dr]C[B: better]))
(;W[rj];B[ro];W[rp];B[rm];W[rk]C[B: How can black get two eyes?]
))
(;W[nm]C[dead?
B: I think so.
I still prefer an attacking move like N8.
Attack from the distance! This moves strengthens black (but in that case it strengthens black not enough so that he has a big chance to survive).
Attack from the distance not with attaching moves!]))
