C[Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for taking a look at this game.  I feel like I made quite a few big mistakes of direction in this game, but my opponent let me back in the game with some aggressive play.  

The first corner went well for me (I think), but I neglected to defend my group in the upper left and gave my opponent great influence.  Then, I tried to approach the bottom left and gave my opponent a large corner.  I'd appreciate comments on any aspect of the game but would be especially interested in the two left corners and how you would have played them.

Thank you!
Munisai

idigo: I'd agree with you that you made many mistakes of a directional type, but I think that you could also benefit from a less conservative outlook toward the game.

If territory is the heart of a game, then the struggle between groups is it's pulse; the two are inextricably linked in any meaningful game. In several places throughout the game, I thought that you were playing very slow moves out of an underappreciation/misunderstanding of this aspect of the game. 

There were a few other kinds of mistakes present, and several opportunities for better play, but I think that I'll let my specific comments speak for themselves, in that regard.

I hope that I've given you a wide range of ideas on how you could improve. Best of luck in your future games.]

(;B[mn]LB[mo:A]TR[pn]C[M:  This feels right, but is A better?

idigo: n6 is a bit excessive, particularly when white is guarunteed any ladder that may arise. When you have general tactical superiority in an area where one of your groups and one of your opponent's groups are grappling, it is usually good to draw back. An exchange which adds a weakness to both groups will usually leave the underdog with more leverage than he had before.

In this particular situation, it should be clear that both A and n6 leave white to fix the cut at q6, while n6 alone leaves the very severe potential of the white cut at A. Black is likely to lose something tangible, this way.

I think that white probably can get a convincing upper hand. I'll try to add a number of variations in order to show my reasoning on this.]

;B[qr]
(;W[mq];B[rl];W[pk]C[M:  Did I give white too much with the S8 for Q9 trade?  Did white get too much thickness for the large corner black got?

idigo: White could have done a better job sealing black in, I think, in which case white would definitely have the better position. It is distressing to see that black got to push on the right side until white's block was no longer sente. 

Black has sente to deal with the left, about 25 points in cash in the corner, and if he gets the local followup at r10, it could start interacting with the n6 cut in an unpleasant way for white. Because the rest of the board is still quite open, I might still like white's chances, but the difference is small.

Certainly, no one has collapsed, yet. The white influence on the outside is nothing to sneeze at. I believe that both sides of this board are highly playable, at my skill level.

White's influence is going to be a big talker in the evaluation of the overall board position for some time to come. I think that in many ways, it is more accurate to say that subsequent play will decide the value of this corner exchange; it'll be up to white to prove the outside power useful, and up to black to prove it useless.]
;B[ce];W[fd]C[idigo: I see no reason why white would want to play this way. f16 strongly emphasises the top, and the top is not that big to develop: the low, solid p17 stone makes it relatively uninteresting for both sides. The left, on the other hand, is in the shadow of white's influence, and the d4 stone wants to extend very much. White should pincer.]

(;B[cc];W[cb];B[dd];W[ec];B[bc];W[bb]C[M:  This seems greedy to me, so I extend from the top right to deny white the extension.  In doing so, I open up my position to be attacked...  Should I have extended, instead?

idigo: yes! Not only is the left where you want to play anyway, but it is very urgent to defend your group. Even if you extend as far as h17, b18 secured good eye potential for white, and the white group has no problems accessing the center. If you play on top, white will be able to attack your stones to good effect.]

(;B[kc]LB[ch:A]C[M:  Something like A instead?

idigo: Definitely. You say that you played l17 to deny white's extension, but white still has an extension to j17 whenever he needs it. P17 is part of a solid position, too, so l17 has very little to do with the safety of groups. It's a small gote move. A is far more important.]
;W[cg]
(;B[dg];W[ch];B[df];W[dh];B[ff];W[fh]C[idigo: With the last few moves, white has created a  moyo over more than a quarter of the board, and black still isn't healthy yet. White has a very good game now.]

(;B[hc]C[idigo: Too greedy, I think. Black is still very weak.]
;W[hd];B[id];W[he];B[fe]
(;W[gc]C[M:  I feel like I came out badly.  H17 and J16 induced moves that made white stronger, and I am left to settle in gote.]
;B[be]C[idigo: It's always very painful to have to play a defensive move like this: it amounts to a pass on the rest of the board.]
;W[cn]TR[mm][er][kr]C[M:  At this point, I know I need to get into the bottom left.  I feel like N5 is attackable, and I want to activate N6.  I choose to approach at F3, but this moves doesn't feel right.  What do you suggest?

idigo: Well, if you want to make use of the n6 aji to settle, you have to play close enough to activate it. 

The basic idea for playing an invasion in a difficult area is to look to play a chain of kikashi until you are left with miai for acceptable life. I've marked the three areas where black could expect to find sente moves. Most of the time in this sort of situation, you'll want to begin in one of these areas.]

C[M:  I choose to activate N6 instead of saving F4.  I figured I'd get ko aji in the corner.  Was this a good choice?  (It doesn't seem like it, in retrospect.)

idigo: You can't really expect ko aji if f4 dies, but I think that n7 is a good move, helping your center group while putting pressure on white. That pressure should help you to settle your own group, and to make territory on the right.]
;W[gp];B[go];W[gq]
(;B[hn]C[idigo: h6 is extremely suspicious. It doesn't really do much except for defending an eye for your group. While thick, it is an entirely single-purpose move, and quite slow.]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[eo];B[cq]C[idigo: Did you read that you could live if black played tenuki? If not, then you may have just died in gote. Even if you live (in gote), the timing seems too early; life in the corner will likely be small compared to a move which affects the balance of power of the groups outside.]

(;W[dr]
(;B[qh]LB[qj:A]C[idigo: At A would be much stronger than the game. I'd try to get in the o8 kikashi first, though.]

;B[jk];W[ll];B[kk];W[ml];B[im];W[nm]C[idigo: another turn for the worse, for black.]
;B[hj];W[oe]LB[nc:C][nd:E][od:B][qe:A][pf:D][oh:F]C[M:  A probe for aji in the corner, I think?  What would you have played?  I considered A, B, and C.

idigo:
I wouldn't really call p15 a probe. White is trying to reduce the potential of your framework, by playing in with a stone that is difficult to attack.

 A and C are extremely slow, pessimistic moves. I wouldn't even think about them except in special circumstances. Black has a local numerical advantage, so should expect to be able to secure his territory while actively some amount of pressure on white.

A and C are ideas better placed at D and E, respectively. B is also probably a bit better at E, though the difference is relatively small. F is another idea, particularly if black feels that securing the territory with D or E would not be enough.]

(;B[qe];W[nc];B[od];W[lc];B[ld]LB[kd:A]C[idigo: 9 times out of 10, A is the stronger response. By leaving a weakness behind to defend, it is harder for black to keep up the momentum against white. The game move is more for when you  feel like you are the one under attack (to the point of needing to play lightly), but that isn't really the case, here.]

;W[ne]
(;B[kf]C[idigo: The white stones are quite horrible, so it is probably good to attack as severely as you can. To do that, I think that it is better to reinforce the o14 stone, and hinder white's advancement toward the q9 stones. Now that the l17 stones are solid, it will be much harder for white to escape toward the left.]

Even very very strong players* will occasionally make similar blunders, but this sort of oversight (from both white and black, in this game) is pretty embarassing, no matter what your skill level is.

2. More severe attack on q9. This will help your territory to solidify naturally, and also aid in the defense of your center group.

3. More efficient extension from the black corner enclosure on the top. Because of 1, r10 will be about as strong against invaders as r12, and because of 2, it's highly unlikely that white will have the opportunity to invade, anyway.]
