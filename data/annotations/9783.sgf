C[[NM\] Hello,

My name is Neil Mclean

I will review your game.

I can help with some direction of play mistakes.

Two things i notice.
1. Many moves that have a  small value. Not urgent. not big points.

2. Moves that have a wrong idea. Wrong intention. Need a clear understanding for the aim of the move.

Hope my comments can help you understand.
Enjoy!];B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[qp];B[ec];W[qf]SQ[ec][cd]MA[cj]
[ej]LB[co:1]C[[NM\] R14 Wrong direction for white.

Left side is biggest.
Two stones at C16 & E17 need an extension at C10 to make a box shape.

White stone at D3 needs an enclosure at 1.];B[pf]LB[jd:A]C[Is this an OK joseki to go for? Or would it be better to play this with a stone around A?

[NM\] Q14 is good if you have a stone at A before.

I would play O16.

Q14 is ok, not bad.];W[qg];B[pg];W[qd]
(;B[qc];W[pc]
(;B[oc];W[pb];B[pe];W[qb];B[qe];W[rd];B[re]C[Was it a good idea to split the groups?

[NM\] Yes, good idea.

It would be very bad to let white join up. Too big];W[rc];B[jd]
TR[co]C[[NM\] You could also think about playing C5 here.];W[ph]

(;B[oh];W[pi]
(;B[qh];W[rh];B[qi];W[qj];B[oi];W[pj];B[cj]C[[NM\] I still like C5 better. 

It stops white getting a shimari and expands your framework more.]
;W[ob];B[nc]C[[NM\] O17 I feel is needed but I dont like playing O17, I feel it is giving points for nothing in return.

But now you have a wall O17 is needed.];W[nf]C[[NM\] your opponent likes to make these deep probe moves.]
;B[rg];W[ri];B[rf]TR[nf]C[I thought it would be nice to get some extra liberties in before starting to attack the marked white stone.

[NM\] Bad idea. You have given your opponent a free move.

The group has 6 liberties before, which is very safe.];W[qh]
C[[NM\] Worth 2 points, small move]
(;B[lf];W[mg]
(;B[mf];W[og]
(;B[lg];W[mh]

Do you save the two stones or let them die to get forcing moves instead.

I think let those two stones die.];W[oj];B[lj];W[ni];B[mj];W[ne]

(;B[od];W[md];B[lb]LB[mc:A]C[I was afraid of the cut at A, is there a better response here? Or should I have avoided this situation altogether somewhere earlier?

[NM\] Yes playing O15 earlier.

M18 looks the only move.];W[mc];B[nb];W[mb];B[ma];W[lc];B[kb]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[jb];B[ib];W[pm]SQ[op][qp][oj][qj]C[[NM\] P4 would be a bigger box shape here, yes?]

(;B[do]C[[NM\] D5 is ok

An idea is to split the bottom at L3 instead?];W[ef]C[I'm still not sure how I should handle these deep kind of invasions

[NM\] E15 is a usual reducing move instead. Although E15 is mybe too deep here.]

(;B[fh]C[[NM\] good idea.

Perhaps E12 instead.
Because white can attach at E12 here.]

i still like E12 though.

You dont need to kill it no, you can still win.];W[je];B[he]

[NM\] yes];W[jp]
(;B[mm]TR[nj][mj][lj][lh][ig][hg][gg][fh][cj]C[Pretty sure this is bad direction of play from me.

[NM\] proverb is 2 space extension from a 2 stone group.

3 space extension from 3 stone group.

Here 1 stone too close.

you are playing too near your influence (triangle stones).

I would play P4 possibly.

Looking at the board, you are LOTS of points ahead in territory so play it safe now.

P4 would be safe enough, it wont get killed. And destroy a lot of potential white points at the bottom.]
;W[eh]
(;B[fi];W[ei]
(;B[ge]C[Wanted to prevent an eye.

[NM\] wrong idea, you let white escape at E10. Almost a pass]
;W[ej];B[dg]LB[ff:A]C[too close? or just wrong idea? Would capturing at A have been better to connect all my groups?

[NM\] Do you need to connect your groups?

The groups are all safe, because you kill h19.

Now D13 is a nice probe.
Mybe D8 looks a good point];W[eg]

;W[jn];B[jo]C[Here he resigned, which I found odd, because Score Estimate says he's 50 points ahead

[NM\] how about counting.
i make about 66 for black.

and about 74 for white + komi.

so yeah, white ahead.

It depends how much black points you can get at the bottom because you have a strong centre position.

So mybe white thought that she was loosing these little battles and did not count.

[NM\] I can recommend you study more shapes, how to make solid shapes.

Also dont be afraid to put stones all over the board. 

As i see you tended to try keep all your stones together and extend a little too close each time.

Better than G9. G9 does not kill because of the ladder breaker at K4.]

Q17 is ok.

Two Square stones point in  the direction of C10 and C5.

So building a wall at Q14 is not the best idea.

I think not to worry about getting A of the reason I said.]
