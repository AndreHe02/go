AB[pp][dp][pd][dd]C[Hello,

I m KGS 10k and play this game as black with a 4 stones handicap against a 6k.

I put some thoughts at some points of the game to explain some of my actions.

Thank you for reviewing my game.];W[qf]
(;B[qi]LB[nc:A]C[I chose a lose pincer to avoid hard fight to early...

Ben:
If that's your goal then play at "a".  In general any pincer is pretty fighting.  Or tenuki, see the previous variations.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pc]SQ[pd]C[I protected the corner. On an even game, I would chose contact at P17 but once again I chose to avoid fight.
Is that ok ?

Ben: First of all any contact plays serve to make the contacted stone stronger.  So you should avoid them.  However if in doing so you can attack a weaker stone then it is acceptable.

The second thing I would say is the play in the game is unusual.  My feeling is that marked stones are simply heavy now.  Let's go back and look at some alternatives.]
;W[rd];B[lc]SQ[pc][pd]TR[rd][qf]C[Tight pincer this time, I think without the corner, I have to attack...

Ben: True but the situation is complicated.  How strong are the marked white stones compared to the marked black stones?  Can you really expect to kill o-17?  In any case its worth it for white to run out with this stone.]
;W[md];B[ld];W[me]C[Ben:  Or n-14];B[le];W[mg];B[mc]C[12 is not very good I think. I dont remenber what I was thinking...

Ben:  Well it forces a response..];W[od];B[oc];W[nb];B[oe]C[Trying to get him heavy...

Ben:  How heavy your are is a relative thing.  With a stone on n-13 his stones are basically out.]
;W[nd]SQ[oe][pd][pc][oc]MA[hc]C[Ben:  Here I would suggest a play somewhere around X.  The marked stones can be treated as bad aji for white.  He really can't stop to kill them as that would give you sente again but they may become a problem later if he doesnt.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[pf]C[Separate the 2 white groups...

Ben: I can see that things don't work out too well for white here soon.  With the next few plays black forces white to live on the bottom.  And it becomes a situation of white's weak group running vs. black's weak group running.]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[qh];B[ph];W[pi]SQ[mg][nb][nc][od][nd][md][me]
C[Ben:  This is actually a pretty good gamble for white.  He is wagering his potential on the right side for an attack on the marked stones.  Black's stone on r-11 is important too.

But this is a handicap game for white, he needed to find away to get the marked group to live as well as get a good result on the right.  Since he couldn't do that I would say you are still doing quite well.]
;B[oi];W[pj];B[ri];W[oj]C[Ben: Maybe something like m-14 or o-12 would have been a more challenging problem to solve.  Since possibly r-18 and t-13 are miai.]
;B[ni];W[ng];B[lf];W[mf];B[lh]C[Enclose...];W[lg];B[kg];W[mh]
;B[mi];W[ob];B[pb];W[mb];B[lb];W[rb];B[nh]C[Ben: p-12 is better.]
;W[qj];B[rh];W[rf];B[og];W[rj];B[nf]C[I think 50 is useless. I should have take sente.

Ben: Yes];W[qn];B[qp]C[Ben: Now this good.];W[nq];B[nl]C[A pincer around L3 is probably better ?

Ben: Or even something simple like p-2.  Black is still far ahead.]
;W[pr];B[ql];W[pl]C[Ben: White should have played at r-7.]
(;B[pm]C[Ben: Black returns the favor. See the variation.];W[ol]
C[Ben: Now W really ought to play r-7];B[om]C[Ben: Well I don't mean to beat a dead horse but B r-7 was the way to go here once again.]
;W[qm];B[no];W[kq]C[Ben: W came out ahead here. But B is still doing well.]
;B[lp];W[lq];B[mp]MA[cj]C[Ben: Small, compared to d-10 or c-10.]
;W[kp];B[ko];W[jo];B[kn]C[Ben: So small, did you think you group was in trouble?]
;W[jn];B[jm]C[Ben: Tenuki, tenuki, tenuki.];W[km];B[lm];W[kl]
;B[ll];W[cq]C[I think white shouldnt take the corner now. There is still a big point arround C10.

Ben: This play isn't any more or less better than any other approach W could play.  He's losing no matter what he does.  This kind of play at least has the advantage of being something you wouldn't expect, which is actually probably his best bet.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq]
;B[cn];W[gr]MA[fd][dj]C[Ben: You did well to tenuki but I would have gone to one of these marked points.]
;B[im]C[D10 is bigger I think...

Ben: Agreed.];W[ep]
(;B[eo];W[fp];B[gp];W[cc]C[An other 3-3 invation. Is it right for white ?

Ben: Again white needs to be unpredictable.  In a handicap game it usually isn't important to be overly critical of white's technique, he's kind of forced to do whatever he can.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[bd];B[be];W[bc]
;B[cf];W[kh];B[li];W[jg];B[kf];W[jh];B[kk]C[J14 or D10 much bigger I think...
Afterward, I have the feeling I lose the game on this stone. Later white invade C10 and I dont have the skills to fight...

Ben: Yes hindsight can be 20-20.];W[gb]C[Ben: I think h-18 is possible but sometimes h-17 is a safe alternative if you know your ahead.  D-10 still looks big also.]

(;B[hc];W[ee];B[ed];W[fe];B[eg];W[de];B[ce];W[cj]C[Now white invade.

Ben: Well he had to.];B[ej]MA[ch][cl]C[I try to kill...

Ben: A better way is at either marked point, he can only run to nothing.]
;W[ei];B[di];W[eh];B[dh];W[dj]MA[dg]C[Ben: Id take the aji away at X.]
;B[ek];W[dg];B[cg];W[df];B[ch];W[fg]C[Ben: Now he gets a group to live in your moyo.]

(;B[dm]C[Outch, didnt saw it...];W[dl];B[cl];W[dk]C[Ben: White gets everything to live, its clear he got away with something.  Before this turn events you were still winning I believe.]

C[Bad, can be cut...];W[hq];B[iq];W[hp]
(;B[ir]C[Ben: See the variation.

You were able to spot a few situations where  you made small and or futile plays.  Eliminating this tendency will help you to improve much.  But most of the time you were able to navigate through the obstacles fairly well.  

Expect white to play oddly in a high handicap game.  And don't blindly follow his plays.  Tenuki when there are big plays still on the board.  Finely use resources like go4go.net and gobase.org for ways to innovate in a game.  These kinds of databases are invaluable in building your strength.
