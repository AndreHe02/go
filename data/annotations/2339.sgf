C[I had (or I thought that I have) an advantage after opening game, but I wasted it all in the middle game ... I know I could have played 1 or 2 moves better, but it still probably wouldn't guarantee the winning :(

This move is playable.];B[nc];W[pc];B[nd];W[qg]C[KS: seems white went too far, I was able to cut through later in the game

At this point of the game, this is a pretty solid move.];B[jc]
;W[eq];B[gq];W[eo];B[dn];W[cr];B[ck];W[jq];B[mq]C[KS: Wouldn't my G5 be better?

G5 is definitely better. It can pressure the 3 stones on the lower left as well as threaten the single stone at K3. N3 would be ok if G3 wasn't there.]
;W[gp];B[cf]C[This extension a bit too far.];W[ch];B[fc];W[df]
;B[cc]C[Actually, you should have gone for the right side instead of playing for these small points]

(;B[qo]C[Actually a pincer at R8 would be better as you already have N3 in place.]
;W[pn];B[pq]C[KS: I'm not sure about this move ... maybe R10 instead? or L4?

This is definietly not a good move. You're placing a stone inside your own territory. This is giving the opponent a free move.]
;W[qj];B[ef];W[de];B[eg];W[dg];B[di]C[KS: I think I should have played G13

G13 is playable but a simple extension to E12 would have been simpler. You could've built a great moyo here. The knight's move still leaves weak points considering the strength of white in that area]

;W[ie];B[je];W[jf];B[ig];W[ff];B[if]C[KS: I though I would be able to kill white groups started at G16, but he managed to gain a lot of ground instead :-( ...

All this could have been avoided if you extended at E12 instead of using a knight's move at D11]

This is the game. Black's main mistake was to place too many stones within his own territory and gave white a lot of free moves. Also, many of black's moves gave white the opportunity to strengthen his own territory while not giving black any advantage.

If there are any more questions, feel free to give me an email.
