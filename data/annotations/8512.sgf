C[Dear reviewer, I send you this game, that I have already try to comment. In fact, I would like to have comments on global flow of the game, and direction choices. At move 82, I tought I had loose the game, but I succeed coming back during yose.

Hi Laurent, I'm Greg, your reviewer for this game. I'll preface any comments I have with "GC:". I hope you find this review useful, and you have any other questions about the game, or in general, you can email me at gtc.cole@gmail.com]

GC: I would suggest a pincer here, anywhere around C seems fine. It fits better with th opening already: it makes a nice extension from the corner enclosure.]

at this time, I tought the game was bad for me, and I had a hard job to find a plan...

The main thing that seemed to put you down in the beginning of the game was overrvaluing certain moves. Especially the ones at the top because you only got about 4 points out of it. However, white really misplayed the yose at the bottom and got pressed down a lot further than he should have.]
