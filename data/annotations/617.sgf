;B[hq]C[MK: I have no idea how to handle this move. Any better idea tha\
n C3.   

   

There are lots of other possibilities  for white 14, C3 D3 C6 D6 F5 H4.\
   

   

My favourite would be tsuke nobi with H4 followed by bJ4 wH5 . The aim \
of this move is to move in the center and attack on the right.   

   

A common continuation would be:   

wH4 bJ4 wH5 bG3 wF4 bD6 wE5 bC3 wL4 bJ5 wJ6 bK5 wH7 ...];W[cq]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[fr];B[go];W[dl]C[MK: Too direct?   

   

Yes, you're going right in the lion's den.  

 Instead of 20, I would play keima at G15.



Another idea would be to play Q10 

waiting for Black to expand his moyo with G15 before reducing it lightl\
y from the top with H10.];B[ek]C[Playing 21 with keima at F9 seems the \
most severe to me.];W[fm];B[hm]C[Likewise for black 23,  playing keima \
at G8 seems more severe, but anyway it's still difficult for white.]
;W[dn];B[bq]C[For 25, Black should connect at F4.];W[br];B[bp]
C[This hane and connection (25 and 27) was not sente because your white\
 group can make eyes with either A2 or H2.   

   

So you should now cut with F4. Doing so you would take the initiative i\
n the fight.];W[ar];B[en];W[el];B[fk];W[cj];B[ci];W[ck];B[bi]
;W[gl];B[nq]C[Black is leaving the arena in the middle of the bull run.\
   

It is usually a very bad mistake.

   

Black 37 should be keima at J9 sealing white in and forcing him to live\
 under the black stones.];W[pn]C[So, white 38 shoud be merely pushing a\
t H8 before jumping at H10 to let the white group breath some fresh air\
.];B[ql]C[Likewise 39 should be first keima at J9.];W[pl];B[pk]
;W[ol];B[gm]C[Black 43 looks like a strange move,  white could simply c\
onnect. But I think  that connecting risks to be too heavy so I would l\
ive first , letting black cut.];W[bn];B[qj]C[Locally for 45 the shape m\
ove is R7.   

   

But Black should first cut at F8 that would make him very strong in the\
 center.];W[em]C[White should make his group completely alive with C7 o\
r connect at F8.

The exchange of 46 for 47 is not necessary nor sufficient to live .]
;B[fn];W[fl]C[After exchanging 46 for 47 it's no longer good for white \
to cut with 48 because it gives white very bad shape.  After 48 the exc\
hange of 46 for 47 has become a very bad exchange.];B[hk]C[Black 49: be\
tter with keima at J9 (it leaves less cutting points)];W[cm]
;B[hc];W[jc];B[lc];W[hd]C[White 54: Terrible !  

  

Usually,  the aim of this move is to sacrifice the stone, giving Black \
a ponnuki in the center so as to connect smoothly underneath.   

   

It's nearly always a very bad move. Giving the ponuki is terrible.   

   

In this game, that would mean a sure win for Black.   

   

If you want to connect your stones you should play H18.];B[gc]
C[But, you are lucky because Black prefers to scramble miserably under \
your stones.   

   

This move (Black 55) is called: "bumping your head into a hane" and is \
very bad shape.



Black should play hane at G16.];W[gd];B[ic];W[id];B[fb];W[eb]
C[You should have played White 60 at E17 so that black cannot cut you i\
n sente by giving atari at F16.];B[fd];W[ec];B[jb];W[kb];B[kc]
;W[jd];B[ib];W[ig]C[White 68 should be keima at M15 that aims to play t\
suke at N17.

You should aim to use the aji of white 64.];B[gg]C[Black 69 is the wron\
g direction to attack the white group it should be M15.];W[ld]
C[White 70 should be keima at M15.];B[md];W[le];B[me];W[lf]
;B[mf];W[qc]C[White 76: Hane at N13.   

   

You should always hane (or nobi) at the head of three stones.   

   

In this position it's vital for your group.   

   

Black can gain a lot of points in the area by attacking your group and \
perhaps kill you.   

  

Whereas in the corner, you can at most live small and gote.]
;B[qd];W[rb]C[MK: Is this move correct? Or is there any easier way to g\
et a ko?    

  

You cannot expect to get ko this way, the usual way is to hane first at\
 S16 and next play S18 but it doesn't work here (Black still plays Q18)\
.  

  

In fact,instead of 78 you should play Q18 yourself first, I assume that\
 this way, you can live or get ko.];B[pb];W[rd];B[re];W[qm]
;B[rl];W[rf]C[For 85, Black could simply connect at R15 and you would s\
till be dead.];B[sd];W[sc]C[For you, this ko is a bounty. It's even bet\
ter than living in gote.  

Black risks more than you in this ko fight.];B[rc];W[fp];B[eo]
;W[rd];B[eq];W[er];B[rc];W[oq];B[np]C[White 94 for Black 95 is a very b\
ad exchange you should not play this kind of move as a ko threat.   

   

As a rule, a ko threat should not lose you points (there are few except\
ions).   

  

If you continue to play this kind of ko threats you will win many ko fi\
ghts but lose many games without even understanding why.];W[rd]
;B[cr];W[dr];B[rc];W[lb];B[mc]C[This ko threat White 100 for Black 101 \
also lose points.   

   

You should have played 100 at 101so as to prepare hane at N13.]
;W[rd];B[bl]C[This black ko threat also lose some points for black. It \
doesn't looks like normal yose.];W[bk];B[rc];W[gb];B[mb];W[rd]
;B[ak];W[aj];B[rc];W[hb];B[la];W[rd];B[bj];W[al];B[rc];W[ia]
;B[ka];W[rd];B[qf]C[If it was to give up the ko, Black should not have \
played some bad ko threats first, such as 103 and 109.];W[se]
;B[qe];W[qb];B[rg]C[Black 125 is not absolutely necessary.    

  

Playing hane at M13, looks bigger and sente.];W[rm]C[White 126: better \
at N13.];B[lg];W[kg];B[kh];W[jf];B[nn]C[Black 131 should extend at K12 \
aiming to kill the white group with H14 if white ignore.   

   

Or, perhaps Black could threaten to kill the White group right on with \
H14.];W[is]C[White 132: Stupid, it's not time to play yose yet !   

   

 Black could ignore your move on the first line and play a bigger point\
 elsewhere.   

   

But even if he answers you should consider that you have only reinforce\
d Black moyo.   

   

Before playing yose you should first reduce it from the top.   

   

Please consider also that any black move here would be gote.]
;B[ir];W[hs];B[js];W[gr];B[hr];W[gs];B[kr];W[jh]C[White 140: good !]
;B[sm]C[This yose also reinforce White.   

   

Black now has no more invasion aji in the corner.   

   

This yose is not double sente as Black could easily ignore a white hane\
 at T8 to play a bigger point.];W[sn];B[sl];W[rn];B[or];W[pr]
