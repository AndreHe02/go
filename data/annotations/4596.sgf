C[Morendil [30k?\]: Hi, gg];B[jj]C[laterza [?\]: Hi ! Good luck !]
;W[cd];B[jd];W[dg]C[This surprised me.

MY:  White should play in the corner at or around D4.];B[ek]
C[The 4-4 point seemed too risky

MY:  Yes, the 3-3 invasion is a bigger threat in 13 x 13 games because the Black (in this case) benefits less from the thickness he builds in defense than White does from a fairly small territorial gain.  But D3 would have accomplished your objective better.]
;W[el]
(;B[fk]C[MY:  Black 7 at D2 would directly threaten White (variation). Black 7 as played cedes the corner to White.]
;W[ck]
(;B[fl]C[D2 would have been much better...];W[dk];B[em]C[MY:  Black 11 at D2 is worth a couple of points.  Black gets an eye at E2 and White is left with a smaller territory.]
;W[dl]
(;B[ei]C[Considered D5 - that would have been better

MY: Yes, and maybe even C5 would be worth risking.];W[di];B[dj]
;W[cj];B[ej];W[dm];B[fm];W[dh]
(;B[gg]C[MY:  I like Black 21 even though White gets a good point at E11. If Black played E11, he would gain territory on the top but White would probably push into the center.  Note that White may be able to invade somewhere around K7 or L3.  Black's advantage at this point is thickness, but he must be careful because a White invasion can spoil everything.  Black can defend by placing a stone at L3 or L4 when he can afford to make a gote move.]
;W[ec];B[hc]C[Should have played L4 instead ?

MY:  Well, the question shows good thinking (see previous comment). But then White can get a foothold in the upper right.  That is one of the challenges of go, that you may have to choose which threat to defend against; if you do one, your opponent will do the other.  His attacks are usually sente and your defenses are usually gote, which makes things even harder.  In this respect, H11 has better sente qualities than L4 and so I like it better -- or should I say, "not as worse".  Note that G11 is also playable.]
;W[kj]C[Quite unsure how best to respond to this

MY:  With correct play, White should always succeed at this corner invasion against one stone.  Normally L3 would be a better move for White than L4.  In this case, L4 works because it projects a threat into Black's center-right which was already susceptible to invasion (see a previous comment).]
;B[ki];W[kk];B[li]C[MY:  I think B27 at K3 is better.];W[ik]
;B[jk];W[jl];B[ji];W[km];B[hk]C[MY:  This is a good move to contain White but that is not what Black should be concerned with.  M2 is the vital point for White's eyes.   By playing M2 instead of H3 Black can probably kill White. If White extends from the J3 stone it is of no consequence because Black can easily keep White from making eyespace in the lower center.]
;W[im];B[ij];W[il]
(;B[hi]C[MY: Black can still play M2 and kill White (I haven't played this out, but White looks dead to me).  Let's try a variation.]
;W[lj]C[MY:  Now White lives.  White is ahead on territory already and has the possibility to invade the upper right corner at L11.]
;B[ld]C[Intending to prevent a similar invasion here

MY:  Good!  That was necessary.  But White still leads.];W[jg]
;B[lg]C[To connect with the top group];W[gj]
(;B[hj]C[Not sure which way to block];W[gk];B[hl];W[gl];B[gm]
C[MY:  I'd prefer H1 here.  Also consider: is it possible that Black M2 is still playable?]
;W[fi];B[fh];W[eh];B[hm]C[MY:  G5 works, too.  It is only one step ahead of the shotgun (if White follows at H1) but decides G6 as Black territory.]
;W[gh]C[MY:  See how annoying this little threat is?  That's why Black should have played G5.]
;B[fg];W[hg];B[gi]C[This way seems to work too

MY:  I'd prefer H6 because it kills one more white stone.];W[gf]
;B[kf];W[he];B[id];W[gc]MA[ef]C[I'm at a loss what to do that might hurt W

MY:  By playing at E8 (X) you can reduce White's territory but you need to wait until move 65 to do this.  Black's next few moves are OK.]
;B[gb];W[fb];B[hb];W[gd]
(;B[hd]MA[ef][ff][ie][hh][ll]C[MY:  Unnecessarily passive.  Any of the marked moves would be better.

And, even though I previously thought White's lower right corner was alive, M2 may be worth a try.  With accurate play (variation), White saves his stones, though.
M2 would be a dynamite ko threat if you had a ko.];W[ie];B[je]
;W[jf];B[mj];W[mk];B[mi];W[ih]C[MY:  White has made a serious oversight.  M2 is unprotected.]

(;B[fj]C[MY:  Black M2 can easily kill the corner now (variation).  Too bad you missed this.  Even supposing that didn't exist, why F4? H6 is worth a lot more!!!  F4 just puts a Black stone in your own territory, costing you a point plus whatever gain you missed by playing a worthless gote move (sorry).]
;W[ef]C[MY:  Too bad Black didn't play here.  White must have known what my go mentor always said, "Please to observe, opponents best move is usually my best move."]
;B[df]C[Giving it a try];W[cf];B[de];W[ce]
(;B[ee]TR[gf][he][ie][jf][jg][hg][gh][ih]MA[de][df]C[MY:  F8 would be better.  You are going to lose the marked stones anyway.  By playing F8 you force white to play at 79, allowing you to extend to F9.  Note that F9 peeps at G9, so white must play there to protect his marked stones, allowing black to extend further.  See variation.]
;W[ff];B[ch];W[cg];B[fa];W[ea];B[ga];W[ed];B[kg];W[kc];B[lc]
;W[jc];B[kb];W[jb];B[lb];W[fe];B[ke]C[MY:  Not necessary and takes away a point of Black territory. H6 is urgent (worth 3 points to Black) because if White plays there Black has to connect at F5.]
;W[dd];B[jh]C[MY:  Good, but not as important as H6.];W[ci]
;B[hh];W[bh]C[MY:  White really needed to play M2 instead.  Black can still kill with M2, as White has neglected to defend (variation).  This would have given Black the win.]
