C[b: Hello! Comments by Mark Fyffe.  I hope you enjoy my commentary.  Slack play can be a slient killer :-)  It is easy to lose track of the opening or fail to make a backup plan in case your original game plan fails to work out.  In this game, white often falls prey to protecting stones that should be sacrificed while giving up important groups.  In counting, it is less important to track the end score as it is to weigh the difference in value of different plays when you have sente.

Hi, thanks for reviewing my game. My weakness has always been score estimation (i.e. I never know if i'm winning or losing unless its a margin of about 20 points) and lack of concentration (I'll just zone out halfway through the game and play a stupid move without thinking...but I digress, this game was relatively fine). I thought I was leading, so my play was relatively lax and defensive, and I ended up losing by 8.5 points. There are a few specific problems in the game, but please also leave some general comments on my overall gameplay (my fuseki, battle techniques, reduction techniques, expansion techniques, end-game etc). Thanks once again!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]C[This reminded me of the Kobayashi Fuseki, so I tried making him over concentrated using the following joseki]
;W[fp]LB[dj:A]C[b: It is better to play big plays than to attack this early, unless white is guaranteed of sente.  See further comments on #20.  I'd prefer D10 here - though seemingly small, it more effectively splits the corner leaving less bad aji than the main line.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[ep];W[fo];B[eq];W[eo];B[hq];W[gr];B[hr];W[go]
;B[hp];W[dq]TR[ep][eq][fq][gq][gr]C[b: This plan backfires for white. Black gets less of the corner, but white has assisted in building a very strong framework for black on the lower side / lower right corner.  D3 is needed for white to protect this corner, but in the end black's marked stones amount to roughly 10 points (2 per stone, 3 black + 2 white). Neither group is a critical part of either play's base.  There are much larger plays on the board for black now than E2, the only local play black has in this situation, but without D3, white is risking a large corner and a failed plan.

In a komi game more than any other, it is important for white to take sente and keep it as soon as possible in order to make up for not getting the first play.  Black now has a wealth of plays worth 30+ points in sente.  White has a big corner, but at the cost of a wide-open left side.]

(;B[fr];W[er];B[gs]C[b: it is, but black did not need to play out this far :)

This felt very good for white.];W[di]C[b: This is good for white.  Black did not need to follow up on the lower left this early in the game, and could have easily invaded this area for greater benefit 2-3 plays ago.  See var on #21.

High chinese fuseki.];B[jd]C[b: Black would be best served at Q10 to leave a good opportunity for white to invade the right side and reduce black's hold over the board.

Now it became quite clear that black is trying for influence, so I tried to break it up.]

(;W[pj]LB[qn:A]C[b: Better to approach a corner or another take another 3rd-line play than to take a high point without a clear way to settle.  I'd prefer an approach at R6 here to minimize black's most settled area, since at approach at R14 is more likely to be sealed against the side or trapped in a pincer.]
;B[de]C[b: on the contrary, this is an obvious play for the corner... and an obvious oversight on black's part to leave Q10 unanswered.  Essentially, black is abandoning his opening plan and going for a fight.  This is an opportune time to take advantage and reclaim the game.  C9 is not necessarily weak - considering the F5 wall and Q10 point, where is black thick enough to invade white's moyo without giving up an equal share of the upper left?

I was afraid of the weak point in the C9 area, so I didn't play the simple joseki (see variation).
If the D8 moyo was destroyed, I think the game's quite over for white.]

(;W[cg]LB[fd:A]C[b: white should simply play F16.  Often, a simple, sensible, and big play, is best to diffuse a permature attack from.  Though seemingly small, a honte play like F16 is best:  give some, take twice as much :)

I was playing for safety, but would C14 be better?];B[cc];W[cb]
;B[cd]C[b: though it would have been best instead of C13, F16 is still the best play to for white for the right balance between settling and extending.  E18 is joseki on an otherwise empty board, but K16 changes the situation and black's greater thickness in the center raise other concerns that make E18 too slow.

I spent about a minute thinking of the next move. I seem to remember E18 is joseki, but as it turned out, the result didn't seem very good for white. What other variations can white try?]
;W[eb];B[ef]C[b: black can seal play F16 now, to force white to settle while collecting thickness to counter Q10.  This play leaves white time to decide, and allows tenuki.  I'd consider capping at K14 to increase thickness and eliminate black moyo on the top side.]
;W[hc]C[or perhaps this was the wrong move, not E18?];B[fd]
;W[fc];B[gd]
(;W[kb]C[b: this is too far.  If you are dissatisfied with the result on the upper side for white, then look here ;-)  Play K18 instead to slide along the side.  Remember that the upper left is settled with one stone at B18.  Also remember that it is better to run than to live and play H16 to cut black instead of this play.]
;B[jb];W[jc];B[ic];W[kc]
(;B[hd]C[b: black should play J18.  This helps white considerably.]
;W[ib];B[id];W[gc]C[White's position seem flat, but the black E14 seems to have lost its meaning. An eye for an eye? But I especially hated the fact that black had such superb influence.]
;B[qm];W[pq]C[b: 3-4 invasion is not uncommon.  However, without a strong framework in the center, white has little to bargain with and these sorts of plays fall flat ;-)  You need more thick plays moving into the center at this point.  O4 invades the same moyo, and also increases white's thickness.  Consider this sort of high approach instead of a corner invasion.

I definitely remember there are a few josekis for this (either white gets a huge corner or a position on the left), but I forgot the moves.]
;B[qq];W[op];B[po];W[qr];B[pr];W[oq];B[rr];W[or];B[qs];W[kq]
LB[nn:B][lo:A]C[b: this lower shoulder hit helps black settle, rather than attack his group, so can be considered bad aji keshi.  White doesn't quite have enough to settle the P3 stones yet, so should run to the center before attempting small life in gote.  M5 and O6 might get this group out, or at least 1 eye in the center increase stability.]
;B[mq]
(;W[lp]C[b: N2 is correct. see var

I used to play this when I was about 13k, so often that this move just came naturally before I could calculate the variations. Perhaps N4 would be better?]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[no]C[I realised something was wrong once he played this move. Can white do better? Or can Black kill both white groups? (Both white groups look weak, but then again, so does the black N3 group).]

;W[pm];B[nl];W[ol];B[nm];W[ql];B[ok];W[pl];B[kr];W[jr];B[jq]
;W[lr];B[lq];W[ks];B[kp];W[jn]C[b: Hmmm... white is already lost in this local situation.  Better to tenuki and leave this aji undisturbed so it can help later.

Mind went blank, played this stupid move. Just for that one instant I forgot that those 3 M5 stones are crucial...]
;B[kn];W[jo];B[ko];W[fi];B[qh];W[qo];B[qp];W[ro];B[rp];W[rm]
;B[rj];W[rk];B[qj]
(;W[qk]C[b: no, this makes 2 eyes in sente and white has better opportunities to occupy the center. This is a good way to to end this situation in sente.

Would Q9 be better?];B[pk];W[pi]LB[kd:B][jm:A]C[b: Q10 cannot survive.  Even with this extension, the ladder does not work. K7 and L16 are much bigger plays for white here.  Again, leave the aji for later if it cannot be saved now ;)]
;B[nj];W[qi];B[ri];W[ph];B[qg];W[nd]C[b: joseki matters little at this stage, with all of the other influence on the board.  Typically high approach is followed by a low pincer or 1-space extension at Q14 - neither is relevant here.  This corner is mostly played out, and white is correct to play a high approach.  Black now needs to consider the large moyo on the left and that his G16 stones have not settled yet.

I played high so that I could help those Q11 stones, but what are the josekis for a high approach to hoshi? or are there simpler variations to save the Q11 group?]
;B[of];W[qc]C[bad move?];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[re]
;B[qe];W[rf];B[rg]C[b: good so far...];W[pf]C[b: Consider the result of this play:  White becomes down 1 liberty in the corner and still leaves Q11 hanging.  Simply O12 will get Q11 the liberties it needs to be effective for fighting.]
;B[qf];W[nf]C[One of my occasional "inspirational" moments. Played O14. looks good for white. But could black have done better? It is an unorthodox move after all.]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[ld];W[od];B[oc];W[og];B[pe];W[mh]LB[rd:A]C[b: not a bad result, but S16 is left open.  Do not sacrifice a solid corner territory for a dragon that earns few points.]
;B[kh];W[ki]C[b: at this point, much is invested in Q10.  Would it not have been better to leave that as 1 stone and work toward it from the other side? I'd prefer L14 is this situation, but it is hard to say the outcome of this fight.

Bad to fight in black's influence, but if I do not, is there any other way out?]
;B[ji];W[kg];B[jg];W[mc];B[md];W[kd];B[lf];W[ke];B[mf]C[I decided to give up the O15 group and stick to my original objective of the Q11 group.]
;W[kf];B[lh];W[lg];B[ng];W[mg]C[can black do better?]
(;B[me];W[li]C[b: If you are trying to save the Q11, why threaten these 2 stones?  Q11 is easily worth 8 points more, particularly if black loses O13.]
;B[jh];W[lm];B[ln];W[mk];B[nk];W[mi]C[b: Q11 is still vulerable.]

(;B[hg];W[hj];B[hm]
(;W[gl]C[b: this is correct.  There are no points in the K8 area for either play - it is all small yose in there.  This play keeps black's reduction small.

This is where I made a strategic error. I thought I had enough to win the game, since I was white. But if I were to resist, how should I counter attack?]
;B[hl];W[gm];B[hn];W[hk];B[jk];W[kl]C[b: K5 is worth 4 points.  Just do not give more than 4 in trying to save them, and white is OK.  Black has no need to counter and white has no cause for concern.

Was aiming to connect the K5 group. But got a bad shape. can Black exploit?]
;B[bf];W[bg];B[rd]C[b: no, white forced this situation some time ago.  In fact, you could argue that playing Q14 is the mistake that lost the game ;-)

I forgot about this corner until this move. can white still live?]

[jr][kr][lr][qr][sr][fs][hs][is][js][ks][ls][rs][ss]C[b: This game was more exciting than you think!  Thank you for the opportunity to review your game :)  White played a solid game in all and was quite evenly matched here. In looking over this game again, try to determine the value of the stones in play:

- are these stones cutting one of my opponents groups?
- do these stones have 2 eyes?
- are these stones part of a large dragon that needs to connect?
- do these stones influence the rest of the board?

In several cases, white is overly concerned with aji and neglects important stones to develop weak groups.  This is typical of weaker play than your level, but your strategy and whole-board thinking early on have made it a tough game for black to get ahead.  In the end, white only lost because of neglecting 15 points in the upper right corner, so really you can feel good that you won this game - even if your opponent got the credit ;-)

Thanks again for this opportunity; I always enjoy a chance to read through an exciting game.  Please let me know if you have any further questions about this game.

Best, Mark.

I played quite a few unnecessary moves as I was under the impression that I was leading, so better be safe than sorry. as it turned out, I should have won easily (I think), but instead lost by a measly 8.5 points. I think this is quite representative of my average game that does not involve fighting (usually I play quite aggressively, and the win/loss margin is around 30 points). This shows my weakness in score estimation and a glimpse of what happens when the Mind-Blanking monster strikes. On the other hand, I felt really happy about the way I was able to make use of sacrifices (my games seldom contain them) and a few good moves here and there. Thus this game is one of the best and worst games I've played.

Please leave comments wherever possible especially when it involves playing the best move. I'm more suited for killing and fighting where there are usually just 1 or 2 moves to consider. When it comes to keeping balance in territory, I fail quite miserably.

Thanks once again!])
