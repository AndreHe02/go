AB[dp][pd]PL[B];W[pq];B[dd];W[fq];B[cn]C[This conservative
answer is often
played nowadays.];W[jp];B[jd];W[cf];B[ch]C[Good.];W[fc];B[fd]
TR[df]C[Is quite possible
but I may prefer
to play on the
other side at
delta];W[gd];B[fe];W[ec];B[dc];W[hc]LB[cf:b]C[Solid as there is
no good way for
Black to swallow
definitively the
other white stone
b];B[df]LB[ce:b]C[Not bad but better
at b. Black is
going to make a
wall and let white
live but his wall
is not so useful];W[cg];B[dg];W[bh];B[ci]C[This moveis not
bad but the nidan
bane can lead to a
less confuse
situation.(variant
b from 19)];W[bi];B[cj];W[bj];B[ge]LB[jc:b]C[First really bad
move for black. a
or b are better
against this
group. b is a
better direction];W[he];B[hf];W[ie];B[if]LB[kd:b]C[Bad too even if
Black has already
the intention to
play b];W[je];B[kd];W[jf];B[jg];W[kg];B[kh];W[ig]LB[lf:b]C[First bad move for
White. It is not a
good idea to
create here a
target to attack.
I will play at b];B[jh];W[hg];B[gf];W[hi];B[ij]C[Black is happy to
get a white group
to push on his
wall.];W[ii];B[jj];W[hj];B[hk];W[gk];B[hl];W[fk];B[fi];W[fj]
;B[lg]C[Better at "a"
because when white
plays there, his
center group is
almost safe];W[ck];B[kf];W[id];B[db]LB[ib:b]C[Wrong side. "b" is
better];W[gb];B[jb];W[ic];B[ce];W[be];B[bd];W[bf];B[dr]LB[pl:b]
C[I would prefer a
move around b];W[ke];B[ld]LB[pk:b]C[JH : It is better
to block and
sacrifice the 3
stones if white
cut in gote. Black
could in this case
play around b and
seems ahead];W[le];B[oc]LB[md:a]C[This leave too bad
aji. Black a is
better.];W[md];B[mc];W[me];B[hq];W[ir]LB[hp:b][ji:c]C[The usual move at
b is better as
white will help is
center group and
may cut at c];B[hr];W[iq];B[gp]LB[hp:b]C[74 leaves bad aji.
b is stronger.];W[qn];B[pr];W[oq];B[qq];W[qp];B[rq];W[or];B[qs]

at b may be a good
idea];B[fo];W[go];B[ho];W[gn];B[fn];W[hn];B[io];W[in];B[jo]

aji];B[hp];W[jm];B[km];W[fm];B[do]LB[dn:b]C[Bad shape. Play at

probably have been
at M10. JH I would
prefer b toprevent
a nozoki at c but
M10 is oK as when
white push at "a",

at b];W[ji]C[better to block];B[ng];W[hs];B[gs];W[is];B[gr]

corner at b; Black
helps white to
live];W[re];B[rb];W[sd];B[qb];W[nf];B[rg];W[sf];B[qk]LB[qj:b]

because black has
some weakness];W[ri];B[sg]MA[pi]LB[qi:b]C[oba: T13 should

agree (0.5 better
) but it is
smaller than b];W[od]LB[pm:b]C[1 point gote. b is
better. White lost
points too in yose
