C[Hi -
This game slipped away from me quickly and I'd like some advice as to what the key moves were.  I was feeling - perhaps incorrectly - that I was holding my own until around move 36.  By move 50 or 60 I think the game was over.  What could/should I have done differently to at least have stayed in the game for longer?

I've put a few comments by some of the moves.

I appreciate any input!  Thanks.

black gets some territory and and out into the centre from the right side.

black also gets k15 which is a very big point
white however gets a good solid group in the middle of blacks influence but the exchange is fair]

 white can still invade at the 3-3 point at c17 and reduce black at k13 so now black is behind

> it seems to me your moves were too slow sometimes, making your stones seem heavy and sluggish
white was able to capitalise on this by surrounding them quickly and take apart your moyo.

building a moyo is a good idea but it is an advanced one which only experienced players can usually succesfully pull off.

beginners usually play moyo because they can see a lot of territory forming but fail to realise that it has many weak points to invade and reduce.

I'd suggest playing more round the sides and taking secure territory whenever possible.

Also dont be afraid to try invading yourself round about p4 or p3 in this game rather than slowly craw along the 6th line while white gets lots of territory at the bottom side. on the 4th.

I hope these comments were helpful and good luck in your games, if I'm on KGS feel free to ask for a teaching game.
