(;B[nc]C[Lamp [9k\]: Part of me wanted to pincer here, in order to prevent white from building a large moyo on the side, but I felt that after a 1-space jump to the center, my pincer stone would have been under more serious pressure than white's approach stone.

EmTom: This is ok. If white creates a moyo on the right you can create a moyo at the top.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rc]C[EmTom: This is a mistake. It skips the extension at R11. You should probably punish it directly by pincering white.]
(;B[np]C[Lamp [9k\]: I don't really know how to approach a 5-4 stone in the opening.  Q3 seemed promising but I erred on the side of caution, aiming to build a moyo on the bottom.

EmTom: Seems like a good idea. I would however prefer O4 one line further from white (at N4). The reason for that is that white will most likely respond at Q3 which will make O4 feel too close to strong white position. N4 would be safer being further away from white and also extension to k4 which is perfect with D4 stone would be a 2 space extension which is more solid.]

;W[mc];B[ob];W[ne]LB[qh:A]C[EmTom: This result is bad for black. It would be better to cut white M17 from right side and let it extend to J17. White would have had a group worth 5 points and this way white got a really nice influence and black got surrounded. Black moves near A are also not interesting anymore.]
;B[db]C[Lamp [9k\]: Maybe I should have simply lived in the top right O19, but I felt the group was alive regardless, and removing the possibility of a 3-3 invasion felt big

EmTom: This is big alright. Next time play d17 though as it is more solid. This way you still left some aji at C17 or E17.]

(;B[qd]C[EmTom: Why did you save this one stone? Wouldnt it be better to just go out right now? :) Sometimes the most "obvious" moves are not the best ones.]
;W[pb];B[oc]C[EmTom: The worst possible scenario. Heavy eyeless group for opponent to attack. I think the more moves you play trying to defend everything the worse your situation becomes.]
;W[qg];B[og];W[nf];B[ng];W[of];B[pg];W[pe];B[qe];W[re]C[Lamp [9k\]: I guess I was wrong about it being alive.  I think white kills me if he connects here.  I'm not sure why he didn't

EmTom: Yeah totally. He did not read that out and was affraid to connect...]
;B[oe];W[oa];B[md];W[na];B[pe];W[le];B[co];W[qh];B[lf]C[EmTom: What was this move for? It does not help N12 that much and it removed a lot of aji. It is better to skip such moves unless you really really need to play this one and only move to do something useful.]
;W[me];B[mh];W[oi];B[dn]C[EmTom: Ooops! You left the fight to play this... It is a big move no doubt about that but ALWAYS play urgent moves before big moves. ALWAYS! This way white gets some free moves (forcing moves) and white gets more points than you did with this move while attacking your weak group.]
;W[mj]C[Lamp [9k\]: at this point I can see that white is building up a strong moyo on the right, so I tried to look for ways to reduce it.]
;B[kh];W[jf];B[qm]C[EmTom: This is very dangerous... You already have a weak group and now you created another one. If you don't like white right side you should have reinforced the center group earlier so that N10 wasn't so powerful. It seems that black may be in trouble now but...]
;W[kj]C[EmTom: This seems to be the wrong attack direction. It forces you out towards your stones so white will have problems killing you.]

(;B[bk]C[Lamp [9k\]: the purpose of this move was to prevent white's B6 group from connecting to the stone at B10, but also to threaten to connect at A10 at the same time, thereby preventing white from making another move to strengthen his B6 group

EmTom: Ok... but what about next white move? and the following sequence? It is clear that your plan did not work...]

;B[qj]C[EmTom: At this point white is so much ahead that it would be difficult to win this game as black anyway. You missed the liberty shortage at the end but the most important mistakes are the earlier ones.]
;W[rn];B[rm];W[ri];B[pi]C[Lamp [9k\]: I thought I could cut off the stones in the center from the right, and then perhaps even cut them off from the group on the left as well, which would lead to them probably dying.]
;W[ph];B[ni];W[nj];B[oj];W[oh];B[ok];W[mg]C[Lamp [9k\]: thx
tyr18k [7k\]: thx
Lamp [9k\]: Obviously this was a misread causing me to lose a large group of stones, but i felt outplayed even earlier as well.  For example, I feel like it was a mistake to let white get so far up the left side, and I thought that territory should have been more secure.  Same with the top, and the left

EmTom: To summarise this game: Your first mistake was when you allowed white to get a strong position in the top-right corner when white almost surrounded your stones there. Then you did not want to sacrifice any stones there which led to you having a heavy group under attack. White did not kill but gained a lot in the process of attacking. Then white made a bad decision and pushed your weak group in the wrong direction allowing you to create a moyo which you (sadly) did not create, so another fight started at the left side which left white comfortably ahead in the game. 

It was an interesting game to comment. Not many tactical errors but some important strategical problems. I hope you will look differently at this game after reading my comments. 

Should you have any more questions regarding the game, feel free to contact me directly. :)]

(;B[fo]C[EmTom: This is a better shape but this result is still bad for black.]

(;B[dm]C[EmTom: I think that at this point it was best to just reinforce here. You leave all those threats that you mentioned active. If white tries to settle his groups you will have sente to play something big. This way the game is still hard for black but it is playeble.]
))
(;B[fj]C[EmTom: Perhaps a counter attack is best here... White did play quite deep in your position. Besides if you back up now the game will become hard for you...]

(;B[gj]C[EmTom: I think this is bigger. It completes your moyo and now it seems much harder for white to invade... Looks like a good game...]
))
(;B[gh];W[gc]C[EmTom: Even if white tries to do something here (which I presume you were affraid of) you can make a HUGE moyo]
;B[ij]C[EmTom: Black was running but white pushed the group in the wrong direction so now white needs to be caucious not to let this moyo happen.]

(;B[of];W[qd];B[oc]C[EmTom: This way you are safe and white is cut. Much better than dying and I think it is worth giving up one stone.]

(;B[ne]C[EmTom: I feel like going out directly. In the game white kind of connected to the right side creating a nice wall which was clearly bad for black.]
;W[ic];B[qh]C[EmTom: If white extends at the top you still have this move and it is severe.]

(;B[qh]C[EmTom: White is not alive locally yet so this fight is ok for black and it completely erases the right side potential points for white.]
