C[Hello!



Thank you for reviewing my game. I have certain questions, but if you see something else, feel free to point it out. Just review for Black.]
;B[pd]C[Snowbars [1d\]: have fun!];W[dc];B[pq];W[ep];B[qo];W[jq]
LB[kq:A]C[janr: I would extend further, up to A e.g.];B[cp]
;W[co];B[bo];W[do]C[rs220675 [1k\]: u2];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[bp]
;B[an];W[cq];B[lq]LB[dn:A][jo:B]C[janr: the move at A is usually larger than it looks.  Personally, I would prefer to play the game move M3 either before the kakari at c3 (to see what white will do) or after A.  In the game, the combination of getting 'A' (in sente) and jumping to B is good for white]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[em];B[dl];W[jo];B[el];W[fm];B[cf];W[cd];B[dh]
LB[ef:A]C[janr: making territory before the thickness looks slow.  Why not play A and invite an invasion?]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[jd];B[pj];W[lo];B[fl];W[pr];B[oq];W[fd];B[gm]
;W[fo];B[or]LB[pb:A]C[I wanted to make sure I get the corner. But the move seems very slow. A mistake? Bigger points out there?

janr: I think taking the other corner at A is bigger];W[pb]
;B[kp]LB[pb:A]C[janr: I would prefer to answer in the top right corner. 
The cut in the game makes white stronger, and removes black liberties.  It is very well possible that in complicated fighting black will lack liberties.]
;W[jp];B[ko];W[pk]LB[jn:B][kn:A][ln:C]C[Please look if my following sequence against Wq9 is alright. I always have problems to know what to do against such attachments within my moyo.

janr: I would first exchange white A for black B or C to see how black cuts.]
;B[qk];W[qj];B[ql];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi];B[qi]LB[nj:A][ko:B];W[nj]
;B[rj];W[ok];B[ph]LB[qj:A]C[This  move at q12 is not necessary to connect to my stones at q16+r14. Do you think it is a mistake?

janr: Clearly, connecting at A is better.  Capturing at A would be sente for white, and would connect all whites stones.]
;W[qc]LB[hc:I][lc:D][gd:C][hd:J][id:A][kd:B][qj:E][ok:H][jo:G]
[ko:F]C[Now this is a typical situation I always struggle with. I have a loose moyo to attack on top of the board.



1. But how do I attack, where do I begin? After reviewing I think that attachments at A, B  or C are the best. Do you agree? Can you show me a sequence of attack that I get any feel how that should work out?



2. Do you think my natural thinking of reducing/invading the top moyo is OK at all or are there even bigger points?

janr: the R17 stone white just played makes the invasion at D less effective.  Since Black didnt play E, white can at any time make a splendid shape by capturing in sente.  It is hard therefore to attach these whtie stones.
The cut at F now seems to cut two living groups G and H.

Given the current situation, it seems that black nor white have weak groups, and black should choose according to what gives most difference in territory.  Maybe J or D is a good invasion point]

(;B[hc]C[This move is not good in my opinion. Do you agree? And how would you have continued after white's answer at h16 (next move). IMO I just messed it up here.

janr: The move seems to invade in where is white's largest invadable territory. The only question is whether black can live.  If black can not live locally, it's better to play another invasion or reduction.]
;W[hd]
(;B[lc]LB[hc:B][ic:A]C[janr: this move is clearly not the best one.
Allowing white to play A and get perfect shape is too much, even if black can escape with M17.  If black wants to play M17, it is better to play it immediately instead of B first.

How about the variations?];W[ic]
(;B[kc]C[janr: this move is very slow. I'd prefer to run];W[ne]
;B[gc];W[ib];B[gd];W[ge];B[fe];W[fc];B[he];W[gf];B[id];W[gb]
;B[hf];W[hb];B[hd];W[gg]C[If black looses one of the groups A and B, his invasion is clearly not successful.]
;B[hg];W[gh]
(;B[ef]C[janr: I would prefer to strengthen the weak group.  White may have to connect in gote.]
;W[hh]C[White's bending is painful.];B[je];W[ke];B[jg];W[jh]
;B[kh];W[ji];B[jc];W[kd];B[kf]
(;W[le]LB[md:A][nj:C][gl:B]C[Here I feel that I was too greedy. A move at j14 now and I live there, White needs to connect his stones and I can attack the white stones at g12 which should also lead to a reduction around h5. Seems very comfortable for Black.



Do you agree or do you see a way to catch/kill the white stones at m15?



How would you have continued to attach the white stones at g12 after securing life with a black move at j14? I just wanna see how such an attack would look like.



janr: instead of the game move, white can play A to capture the top stones without leaving a cut.
It is not very easy to attack the white center stones.  one may gain a few points in the end, but oiubts such as B and C are helpful for white.
>From here on you don't need to watch the game anymore since I lost my group plus I think I did the pivotal mistakes earlier.]
;B[md];W[nd];B[me];W[lf];B[mf];W[lg];B[kg];W[mg];B[nf];W[if]
;B[ig];W[li]C[janr: black's group is captured and the game is over.  
I see a lot of moves in the later game that make the situation worse, or can be refuted with a little reading, as the opponent illustrates.
