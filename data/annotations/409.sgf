KT: I wanted to keep up the pressure on w.  b S2 robs w from local eye space. If I do not play A or something, b s2 w r1, possibly b s1 and b is more or less stabilized (in gote).  Why is A so important?

Please look at the variations!]

(;B[sp]C[As said before, the corner is strong. If black plays the variation....]
;W[so];B[sq];W[rn]C[very good! After his bad start, white plays strong moves]
;B[sl]LB[sm:A]C[Better at A.];W[sm];B[rm];W[nk]LB[pd:A]C[ to fight this ko, white has to  play a more servere threat like A.]
;B[sn];W[cj];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[jq]LB[iq:A][lq:B]C[The white group at the right is strong, so normally black shoud play A. But since here is
a good continuation at B, Blacks move may be justified, too.];W[jc]
(;B[oj]LB[cc:A][ej:B][je:C]TR[cj][jc]C[Not interesting. This move doesn't surround the right-side territiory properly and has no effect on the white framework. A is a better try.

KT: But but but! I broke my head over how to reduce or invade the white moyo, and thought a made subtle calculations!

 I did not want to play a, because I indeed destroy a lot, but the resulting w wall would make the rest immensely strong. I thought, first reduce from outside, and play a later.  Is this not correct for such immensely large moyo's?

Now p10.  The idea was:
P10 does strengthen b moyo
greatly. If W does not react, I have one more inroad in the w moyo to support an invasion. If W does react, I still have sente.  Not ok?   Basically, your right side is very strong, so it is not interesting to add another stone there. White answers on the outside, and while you add stones in a place where you are strong, white gets stones in a place that was wide open.  Since you are so strong, it is also not interesting for white to play on the right side, since he may end with a weak group under attack. Normally, the best he can do is to play p 10 himself.
A is a very good move in double wing extensions like these. White has to block on one side, black will extend to the other and one of the marked stones will loose its value.
Normally, you can live in the corner in sente, so after that a reducing move at B or C will be perfect, as the variation shows.]
;W[nj];B[oi];W[fn]LB[mh:A]C[Better at A.];B[jo];W[ej]LB[df:A]C[This makes the white stones overconcentrated. If white wants to play here, he should ommit 51: after 51, a move like A feels right.]
;B[id]C[an interesting point!

KT.  I was very proud!];W[jd];B[ie];W[ni]C[white must continue at the upper side. If black gets strong  here, whites whole framework on the left  will be affected.]
;B[je]C[Very strong.];W[ng];B[ic];W[pg];B[md];W[df];B[cc];W[dc]
(;B[cd]LB[de:A][cf:B]C[After the continuation in the game, the marked stone protects the cutting points at A and B, so white can seal in Black completly in sente. Therefore the variation in the diagram might be better.]

[qj:B]C[  Now white has a good move at A. Better shape  for black is B.

KT: I know it is bad shape.
But after  a move at b, w can continue with q9 or q 10,
and shap is ruined anyhow.
No?

B has better endgame potential on the right side.];W[gg];B[jh];W[lf];B[le]
;W[kg];B[ig];W[rf];B[gh]LB[hi:A][re:B][es:C][fd:D][oh:E][ac:F]C["There is no territiory in the center". From here on both black and white play many moves in the center, most of them nearly worthless. If you play a white stone at, say, A, you will notice that it only surrounds about five points of territory. Any of the moves from b to f is much bigger.

KT: Yes, very bad move.
I saw it when the stone lay there, useless, and decided to abandon it.]
;W[fh];B[re];W[gi]C[compare this move with the last black one!];B[oh];W
[nh];B[og];W[of];B[nf];W[oe];B[ph]LB[ne:A]C[very bad. once black starts this cutting sequence, he has to continue with A, saving his cutting stone. Otherwise he made white strong at the outside  and gains nothing in compensation.]
;W[ne];B[qf]LB[qg:A]C[Maybe better at A, which leads to a ko.];W[pd];B[pc]

;W[hh]C[THERE IS NO....!!!!! two points in gote!];B[jl]C["....."

KT:  Ok, I see that your moves are bigger. I should have played e1 first, it is sente anyhow.  But still, I have to do something to avoid that W makes territory in the center.
I do not play j6 k8, w at say l6 does make territory, so does w at k12.

It is so hard to make territory in the center because it is open in many directions. If white plays at the top, black will anwer at the bottom and vice versa. Moves in the center are normally much smaller than they looks! I try to explain this at move 133.]

(;B[lm]LB[ac:A][ad:B][bb:C][cb:D]C[ Black can't cut at the left, so A is much bigger. Black has six points of territory in the corner and will be able to destroy a white point with B in sente later on.
