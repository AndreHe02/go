C[This is a game I just played on KGS.
I am black and I won by a few points, but I'm not really satisfied with the way I played!
I left some questions and comments for things I noticed after the game!

Thanks for reviewing!

GP: Hi, I'm Graham Philips (topazg) a British 1k and KGS 1d. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can, and I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf.

Where I'm offering or annotating variations that deviate from the game, I mark the game move with a square and the deviation with a triangle.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[pp];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp]TR[dn]SQ[ic]
C[I chose to tenuki here to make a chinese formation at the top, which probably wasn't the best choice. Is the variation okay or should I play this approach differently?

GP: It's brave, and not unplayable. This joseki is often left here in professional games for other reasons, leaving the aji of the D6 cut to either connect when it's best to do so, or make White's cut not effective enough to be worth playing.

However, with your formation at the top, I would play out the normal joseki. You can even choose to play C10 at D10 as that works well with a possible shimari in the top left. There's no need to be fancy if the basic stuff suits the overall board position ;)]
(;B[ic];W[dn];B[qn];W[cm];B[nq]C[GP: However, I think your three moves were definitely bigger than White's. C7 was definitely far too slow, and White should have responded to your approach. This is a good formation Black is creating globally now.]
;W[np];B[mp];W[no];B[oq];W[po]C[GP: White _must_ play Q3!];B[pq]
C[GP: Good, this is a very big move. You are now comfortably ahead in this game.]
;W[qq]TR[qr]SQ[jq]
(;B[jq]C[GP: You didn't punish White enough with this. This makes the corner too easy to settle in. First push White around with his weaknesses, then defend your weaker group at R6 as this one is secure. Don't get me wrong, this move isn't small, but keeping that pressure up is urgent, and because you can do it in sente right now, you should do.]
;W[qr];B[qk];W[qf]TR[nd]SQ[qh]
(;B[qh]C[GP: I would definitely choose not to pincer here. White has thickness in the lower right, and you can make it useless while keeping the pressure up by simply looking after your corner first. As it is, the shape with 3 two point jumps has weaknesses at R10 and R8 to split, and this makes it easier for White to treat R14 lightly and pincer your corner stone.]
;W[nc]C[I wasn't sure how to answer O17. My inital thought was to split the stones with P15, but I didn't like that he could jump into the corner! Now, though, I think it is probably the best move!

GP: I like P15 in this position. I think forcing White to take one side or the other is sensible]
(;B[qe]C[GP: This is definitely the first "bad" move you've made. All this does is strengthen White and leave Black in bad shape. The corner becomes hard to handle now. The other side is almost playable this way if you are happy inviting the cut (see P17 sequence), else I'd choose O16 here. Make the O17 stone strong to swallow up the R14 stone.]
;W[pf]TR[oe]SQ[oc]
(;B[oc]C[GP: Again, this is also bad. You are inviting White to strongly seal you in to the corner. P15 is a quite acceptable fight, but you must must must (!) keep White's groups separated if you hope for an even result up here. As soon as White is connected, he is thick, strong, and has an influential position. Black's right hand stones become very sad.]
;W[oe];B[nb];W[mc];B[ed]TR[rf]SQ[qc]C[GP: A big point, but I'd much rather take C11 or a position on the left hand side instead. If White takes C11 or C12 now, these stones don't do enough for you I think.]
(;W[qc]C[The invasion was unexpected. I killed it, but it gave him a strong outside. Is there a better way to respond?

GP: If you killed it, your response was fine. The damage has already been done sadly. His outside strength was generated by Black's moves at R15 and P17. Even O18, necessary as it was to settle your group properly, helped make White sttonger. White should have simply played S14 here to create his thickness without giving you more stones first.]
;B[re];W[pb];B[ob];W[rf];B[rb];W[rd];B[sd];W[sc];B[se];W[sf]
;B[rc];W[ri];B[rj];W[qi]TR[ok]SQ[rp]
(;B[rp]C[GP: This is to attack and kill, not to save your group. You must play P9 first here and prevent White from sealing you in.]
;W[qp];B[ro];W[qj]TR[pk]SQ[rk]
(;B[rk]C[GP: Q9 is a must. It's one stone, and not worth a great deal. More than that, White can only capture in gote anyway. Get out of there, whatever you do get out into the center and keep White's groups apart!]
;W[pk];B[pl];W[ol];B[ok];W[pj];B[om];W[nl];B[qm];W[nm]C[GP: A game winningly wonderful result for White. You cannot overvalue this result for White. Black must try much harder not to get sealed in like this, both in the corner and the right. It's turned from an intimidating position that Black was creating to a disaster!]
;B[cj]C[Is this too close to his thickness?

GP: I would probably play C11, as that's as far away as you can play while still depriving him of the ideal extension (he wants to play C10 in response to you playing on the edge so you both get some of it).

However, part of E16's primary purpose is to welcome an invasion stone for fighting, and he cannot make a two space jump inside your territory, so this is a fine move too. His result on the right has been so]
;W[ch]TR[ei]SQ[ej]
(;B[ej]C[GP: One point jump for running, knight's move for attacking. Push him into your stones!]
;W[eh]TR[gi]SQ[cl]
(;B[cl]C[GP: This is aji-keshi. It's much better to play a knight's move again and get that attack going. Keep it hard for White to settle, don't waste any aji around here. The possible atari of E6 could have been very useful.]
;W[bn];B[dl]C[GP: This is far far too slow. Not only was C8 aji-keshi, it's now gote as well. Attack that group! :)]
;W[bf]TR[fh]SQ[be]
(;B[be]C[GP: Here, you are responding to White being silly. He's not going to be making any eyes trying to crawl underneath C16. Think big, attack big. You you have good shape below you can hit hard and contact on F12, as White cutting shouldn't frighten you any more. This way, you have enough killing threats that you should get excellent outside thickness for the E10 group.]
;W[cf]C[I didn't really take advantage of his weak group ... then again, my group is weak too! What's the best way to play here?

GP: See comments on moves from 65 to 71 :)];B[gh]C[GP: F12 is more severe. You don't want him running out across your E10 group. If you are concerned about contacting a weak group, G11 is better to force him to run under pressure.]
;W[fi];B[fj];W[gi];B[gj];W[hj];B[hk];W[ik];B[hi];W[ij];B[hl]
;W[hh]TR[ii]SQ[hg]
(;B[hg]C[GP: Oh no! Here, you have just fixed all the problems he had. Before, he had two cut weak groups, now he has one strong group, and you are left with a heavy G12->H13 group. The ladder doesn't work for him, at least force him to capture G12 with J11 here.]
;W[ih];B[gg];W[fe];B[gd];W[fd];B[fc];W[ge];B[he];W[hd];B[gc]
;W[hf];B[ie];W[if];B[je];W[ig];B[ef];W[fg];B[ne]C[GP: Good. And the fact he doesn't get P16 in sente is why his invasion in the corner in the first place was so poor.]
;W[nf];B[me];W[mf];B[le];W[od];B[nd];W[pe];B[qd];W[gq];B[hq]
C[GP: Contacting here is never good. Contact plays are used for running away with weak groups, not edge fighting when everyone's strong and expanding their territory. Take L13 and get rid of his central moyo first, he can't do you much damage here.]
;W[gp];B[io];W[kg]C[GP: Ouch, this is a huge huge point for the game.]
(;B[pr]C[A few endgame comments would be nice, because I tend to give away sente and usually fail to play the biggest moves first! For example, in this situation, I think now it is better to play towards his big center!

GP: Absolutely :) Actually, there's been a recurring theme of you getting very worried about groups on the edge and making very small edge moves to try and keep them alive. Both the top right corner and the right edge suffered from this, and here's another 6 or so point gote move.]
;W[on];B[pm];W[mo];B[lp];W[il];B[hm];W[km]C[GP: A good direction of play for White.]
;B[im];W[jm];B[gr];W[fr];B[hr];W[eq];B[fn]C[GP: Good, this should have been White's last point.]
;W[eo];B[lf];W[lg];B[ei];W[ii];B[en];W[ce];B[bd];W[ee];B[de]
;W[df];B[dd];W[bl]TR[fo]SQ[bg]
(;B[bg]C[GP: Not as clever as it looks. I used to play these all the time until I realised they _always_ ended in gote. A14 is often better because of sente, although in this case that edge is largely dame. I'd take F5 first while it's there, and then B9 to prevent him making any points on the edge.]
;W[bh];B[af];W[ah];B[ag];W[cg];B[ae];W[bj];B[bk];W[ak];B[ci]
C[GP: Connection is definitely better than this. You take away one point from him, and give two back this way.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[bi];B[dm]C[GP: F5 first, as capturing isn't the right response to F5 so you get this move in sente too.]
;W[dp];B[ln];W[lm];B[lo];W[jo];B[jp];W[in];B[hn];W[ip];B[jn]
C[GP: Good :)];W[hp];B[iq];W[kf];B[ke];W[rq];B[rm];W[ps];B[os]
;W[qs];B[si];W[sh];B[sj];W[rh];B[mr]C[I came back here to defend, but on second thought I don't think he has a threat, because of the extra liberty at P4

GP: Yep. If he plays P4, defend here, otherwise don't :)];W[fo]
;B[go]C[GP: H5 much better, this cost you a few points.];W[ho]
;B[ko];W[gn];B[gm];W[di];B[dj];W[sp];B[so];W[sq]TR[mn]SQ[go]
(;B[go]C[GP: Half point ko fight. Every other endgame move is bigger than this. K14 is 1 point gote. F1 is 2 point gote. D12 is two point sente (and really should be played first) as the follow up is another 6 points if White lets you take E13. N6 is 3 points sente, as he cannot let you play O6 because you kill the corner, so you get to push at N7 too.]
;W[qo];B[gn]C[GP: See, you got one point from two moves here (for the capture)!]

Getting sealed in - The biggest failing by some distance in this game was allowing your opponent to repeatedly seal you in on the corners and the edges. It's extremely rare for this to be anything other than a bad result, and should be avoided at all costs. Moves such as S9, connecting a single stone and letting go the possibility of running into the middle was a disaster.

Connection and separation - The top right is a perfect example of how critically important this issue is. When your opponent approached your corner, you were safe and strong. When he pincered, both of his stones had a Black pincer to worry about, and all you have to do is keep them separated and he'll always be on the back foot. Within 4 or 5 moves he'd herded you into accepting small life in the corner and connected up, removing any weaknesses he had. From there, he was thick and strong enough to launch a full scale assault on your right hand stones, and that half of the board just crumbled away from you.

One point jump versus knight's jump - Your instinct actually serves you pretty well with regards to building up good influential positions, but you then don't use your thickness and strength to attack and fight enough. Kato's Attack and Kill may well help your game here, as will Attack and Defence from the Elementary Go Series. In the meantime, learning that if you are wanting to attack, leaning in with a knight's move is much better than one point jumping into the middle is easy, and will make a big difference to your fights.

*** To take to your next few games ***

I thought your opening judgement was in general very good. The top right went a bit wrong, but apart from that your fuseki skill was plenty good enough for your rank and a bit beyond. However, you get very paranoid about keeping your groups alive when they are at least as strong as your opponent's nearby groups. Have more confidence in attacking from strength, and running out to the middle rather than living sealed in on the edge and in the corner.

If you have one group running and your opponent has two, priority number 1 is keeping it that way. Letting your opponent connect is groups will make his job much easier. Similarly, if the roles are reversed, never underestimate the value of getting your weak groups settled and connected.

I hope these comments are in some way helpful. If you 
have any responses / queries / comments or would like 
further input on specific moves or areas, do feel free to 
ask!])
(;B[mn];W[nn];B[mm];W[ml];B[dh];W[dg];B[fs];W[es];B[gs]C[GP: Also, because there are two kos, with one player to take at each, you can guarantee connecting yours (if he captures yours, you capture his etc).]

GP: I would choose R16 without a doubt. Other than the lower left, White's remaining group virtue is some thickness from his group in the lower right. Giving White a strong corner in the top right down the right edge may well give him severe attacks against your three stones. Playing R16 now allows you to safely swallow that stone once and for all.]
