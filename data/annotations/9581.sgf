C[Hi, I'm ema, my comments will start with E.
Many thanks to the reviewer. :)

E.: I'm actually playing many 9x9 games in order to improve my reading and tactic play.
In this game I'm playing with Black (komi 5.5). I have won but it was close, and I feel I was lucky. I've submitted the game to see if that's the case, and to understand my mistakes.
Thanks.

B: Hi, I'm Bart, around 6 kyu, and will try to comment on your game. My comments start with B.]
;B[ee]C[E.: I usually start with tengen in 9x9.

B: No problem with that, if you want to have an extra stone when corner fights break out (for instance as a ladder breaker). So it's for later on. If you start on a 3,3 point, you get a corner immediately, or, at 3,4 in 2 moves if white plays in another corner.]
;W[fg];B[dc];W[fe]
(;B[dg]C[E.: here I didn't know if I should have played d5 and go on with my simmetric play. I thought that d3 was easier, so I put my stone there.

B: myself, I'd prefer to play F6 first. White will probably answer (G5 most likely), so you stop white from getting al the top and right part, and get to play somewhere else after that (e.g. securing the top yourself). See variation.]
;W[ef]C[E.: this aggressive move surprised me. I expected something like f7.

B: white wants to play this first, because if you respond, he can still play F7, or your variation after that.]

(;B[ed]C[E.: here, to avoid the variation. I was hoping to live with d3 even if White cut through my groups.

B: yes, that's dangerous play. Letting white through your knight move can give a lot of problems. Although, playing the variation lacks you in points.]

;B[bf];W[be];B[bg];W[cd];B[eh];W[fh];B[fd]C[E.: here probably c7 is bigger. I was afraid of being cut...

B: In the variations I tried, it ws not possible to cut, but white could get part of the corner.]
;W[cc];B[db]C[E.: here too, maybe c8 is better.

B: c8 is a few points better, but ends in gote. You still have a sente move at h5, so it's ok to play it like this.]
;W[cb];B[he];W[hf];B[hd];W[di]C[E.: here White starts a sequence that threatens to kill my corner group. I'm not able to understand if I played it right, or if simply I was lucky and White blundered somewhere...

B: the black shape is a more than an L+1 shape, and has some outside liberties, which help a lot. So I think it's alive.]
;B[ei]C[B: good answer.]

(;W[ci];B[ag]C[B: here the liberties on the outside help to prevent white from making a ko.]

C[E.: thanks for the review. :)

B: you're welcome. Seems you put yourself in a bit of trouble by letting white cut through your stones, but as far as I can see it worked out alright.]
