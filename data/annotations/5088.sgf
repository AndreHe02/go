C[It would be a great honor, if someone could review this game.
I am white.

************

Hi Ryoji,

This review is done in English even though we are both German, but I guess it's more polite to stick to GTL standards here. :)

You sent a really interesting game for review, a game heavily dictated and eventually decided by figthing. I tried my best to comment on the tactical aspects of those combats, though I don't consider this my strongest point.

As always, everything I say should be taken with a grain of salt, I'm sure everything I say will seem stupid to a stronger player.

I commented both you and Black's moves, as it is far easier for me to comment the game then.

My comments are preceded by "fey:" to distinguish them from yours.
As usual, there's a more or less brief summary at the end of the .sgf file.

Well, if you have any further questions about the review, don't share my opinion at a certain point or just want to send some feedback on the review in general, you know how to reach me. :)

[ec][ed]C[Recently I often have to play against Chinese fuseki. Do I react appropriate?

fey: I collected some common moves in relation to the chinese fuseki here. 
Good moves for White are marked with a traingle, bad ones with a square.

Each mark leads to a short variation with the continuation and some comments.]

(;W[qf]C[fey: Yes, this is a perfectly normal approach when dealing with the chinese fuseki
I, personally, like this kakari best, although there are other possibilities for White that are also common and good moves.

Check the variations on this move to explore some do's and don'ts when playing against the chinese fuseki.]
;B[nd];W[rd]
(;B[qh]TR[qp]C[fey: This move is certainly playable, but I think that it isn't the best choice in this situation.

We have to consider that White is already low on the right side (R4 komoku), therefore this side isn't really interesting for both of you - White doesn't have any great moyo potential there and Black hasn't much to reduce.

Accordingly, Black could also consider simply taking the corner at R17, getting sente and occupying a big point elsewhere.]

(;W[qk]TR[qj]C[fey: For the reasons stated in my previous comment, this pincer is also played from an uninteresting direction.
Plus, it has *no relation* to your two stones above (the marked point instead would at least threaten to link up) and gives Black the chance to attack them.

I'd really want to play the simple and common joseki move for White here -  R17. (var.)]
;B[pf]C[fey: It feel painful to let Black play this move and I can understand why you decide to tenuki and take a big point yourself, but I reckon that you are more or less obliged to answer here and secure life for your two stones (R17 easily does so) - otherwise Black just gets too much profit, not only in this corner but also in conjunction with his whole moyo.]
;W[oq]SQ[qp][qk]C[Was this alright?

fey: Please see my previous comment.

The move you played is big, alright, but it is far from being urgent.
And of course you can't count the points between the marked stones as your territory, now that Black is quite strong above.]
;B[ed]C[fey: Extending to something like D10 would be another, maybe more positive, way to play for Black here. 
Usually, when playing the chinese opening, you hope for the opponent to come in and invade, so that you can profit from the attack.
So the shimari might not be so terribly urgent and big here; although it is of course not a bad move.]
;W[dj]C[fey: Good! Very nice point.];B[fq];W[jq];B[dm]TR[fp]
[eo]SQ[dn]C[Here I didn't know exactly what i should do.

fey: Basically the idea that White should follow here is simple:

- **Don't allow Black to shut you in!**
- Separate Black.
- Try to get an attack going.

Actually Black's D7 might not have been such a good idea in the first place, because D10 is already pincering this second approach move and spoils any extension up the left side.

The first moves that come to mind are the two points I marked with a triangle in this diagram. As the E5 kosumi is sort of bad shape and lacks the sharpness of the attachment, I'll focus on F4 in the variation.

There is another joseki move in this kind of position, which I marked with a square. In this position, it also looks playable, but it can get a little complicated in some variations and gives Black a lot of space to vary, so if you prefer simple and clear-cut sequences, you can stick to F4 and get a good result.
Just for reference, you can check some of the vars on D6 in the variation.]

(;W[eq]C[fey: Well, you know youself that this was not good...]
;B[fp];W[cq]TR[eo][dn]C[Well this probably wasn't the best.

fey: Even now you should try to think of a way to get out rather than protect the corner. Maybe one of the marked points would have been worth considering, but I'm not sure if this will work out fine after you strenghtened Black with the E3 - F4 exchange.]
;B[ch]C[fey: The game looks promising for Black now - White's stones in the upper right corner are almost dead, the D10 stone is under attack and the lower left corner stones are more or less closed in the corner.

White's only considerable territory so far is his double-wing formation in the lower right quarter, but presently, calling this "territory" seems a bit too optimistic and even if we just compare Black's and White's spheres of influence, Black feels ahead.]
;W[fj];B[fm]C[fey: Black gets the chance to protect the only real weakness he had and connects his two potentially eyeless groups.]
;W[en]C[fey: This is a very direct attack and Black does well to stay connected and refute your blunt peep.]
;B[fn];W[em];B[eo];W[do];B[el];W[dn];B[fk]
(;W[eh]C[fey: Usual sabaki style would be the attachment at D12 instead - please check the variation for some likely continuations from there.]
;B[eg]
(;W[fg]C[fey: Another possibility - just going by shape - would be D12 again, at least it looks like some vital point.
White should have no trouble settling his group after playing there.]
;B[dh];W[ef];B[ei];W[fh];B[ej];W[dg]C[I have read that this formation would be equal to 30 points.

fey: Um... well... ;)

There is this go proverb "A ponnuki is worth 30 points." of course and I think we can agree that this shape can't be bad for you, but there's a certain ambivalence about this result.

On the one hand, you managed to more or less secure your group for now, and you even limited the potential of Black's moyo. Good.

On the other hand, in the process Black got rid of his only sore spot on the board - the semi-weak F6 group.
This former eyeless string of stones has become a powerful wall that glares down on your double wing shimari, threatening to reduce it.
Black may have lost some moyo potential, but he still has his upper side territory.
White is not really satisfied.];B[fe];W[fi];B[di];W[kg]TR[jd]
C[fey: With respect to your group around F12, which is not completely alive yet, this move is ok; but normally you'd rather like to play a more consequent reducing move, especially in a situation like this when White already feels a little behind.

I think I would have just gone ahead and tried something like K16, White should be able to manage both his groups, at least I don't see any truly severe attack for Black.]
;B[ke];W[jn]TR[kg][qk]C[Too high?

fey: No, this looks good and feels more in tune with your marked stones.
The K65 ikken tobi might be a bit safer, but don't worry, you should welcome any fight inside your moyo.]

(;B[qm]TR[oo][rp]C[fey: First of a all, this might not be the best invasion point.
White has no trouble attacking this stone, and even if it lives -which is likely-, White will profit from the attack, either by building something big in the center or in the bottom.

Black has various other possibilities to try, the most common ones are the reducing move at P5 and the attachment S4.
As this are both standard moves, I won't go into much detail here, but it has become quite a habit for me to add some shortly commented variations for you to check. :)]
;W[ok]
(;B[oo]TR[qm]C[fey: Well, I'm not so sure about this move. It is a vital point locally, sure, but there doesn't seem to be a convincing continuation after you separate Black with Q6.

Plus, the marked stones don't look like good shape, so maybe P5 is a bit premature, at least I'd say that the timing is wrong.

I tried to find another way to settle his stones for Black in the vars.]
;W[pn];B[pm]C[fey: This looks quite greedy. It's doubtful whether Black will be able to escape with this stones in view of the fact that White is quite strong all around...]
;W[on];B[om];W[nn];B[nm];W[mk]C[fey: Good.
The fight looks very hard for Black now. Now it looks as if he definitely invaded too deeply.

I don't see any way for Black to make two eyes if White plays correctly - White got his chance to make a comeback.]
;B[mn];W[ll]TR[pn][on][nn]C[fey: This move is ok, but it feels like there is a lot of aji now around the marked stones - just now, there's not much Black can do, but I'd still feel a little uncomfortable.]
;B[lm];W[km];B[lo];W[no]
(;B[jp]C[fey: Normally, K5 would be more of a shape move here.]

(;W[ip]C[Aggressive play, is this alright?

fey: Perfectly alright. :) 
The hane seems the only move. 

(Of course, you could also try to hane from the other side [L4\] to try and punish that he didn't play K5. At least this looks like an interesting possibility and a severe attack on Black.)]
;B[jo];W[kn];B[ko]C[fey: The bamboo joint at M4 is better shape here. Far better shape, in fact. (See the next variation.)]
;W[ln]
(;B[mm]C[fey: Huh? What's that? O.o
Black is being really greedy here, trying to save all his stones and thereby killing them all.

(Guo Juan said something funny on this topic in one of here EGC workshops: "Die together!", when the poor kyu player presenting his game made basically the same mistake as your opponent here.)

I'd propose something like the variation for Black here.];W[mo]
TR[io]SQ[jq][ip]C[fey: Sadly, playing at the marked point doesn't seem possible for White here with respect to all his cutting points...

Black should still occupy J5 with his next move - most possibly White won't have time to connect his two marked stones because otherwise the L8 might become really dangerous.]
;B[kl];W[io];B[in];W[jm];B[lp];W[lq];B[mp];W[mq];B[kq];W[np]
C[fey: Somehow it looks as if Black tricked himself here...]
;B[nk];W[nj];B[nl];W[lj];B[oj];W[pj];B[oi];W[pi];B[ph];W[rn]
;B[rm];W[ri];B[rh];W[rl]
(;B[qi];W[sm];B[qn];W[ro];B[qj];W[pk];B[rj]C[fey: Of course far too small!
After losing all his invading stones, Black can't afford to play a small gote move like this. 
Occupying R17 himself might keep Black in the game, although it has become quite close now.]
;W[qc]C[fey: Yes, good. Normally, making life for this stones would guarantee your win - but sadly enough it's mostly the sure-win games that we lose in the end.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[re];W[sb];B[qd];W[ra];B[rc];W[sd]
;B[kj];W[li];B[ki];W[hk]C[this is probably the losing point, i think.

fey: Yes, you have to protect your M11 group, for example with M12.

Your F12 stones should be either able to connect to one of your other groups (L13 or K8) or look after themselves.]
;B[gk];W[hj];B[lh];W[mh];B[kk];W[ni];B[oh];W[kh];B[lg];W[mg]
;B[lf];W[lk];B[nh];W[nf];B[mi];W[mj];B[ml];W[mi];B[mf]C[I have lost, but I think, I could have won it.

fey: Ah well. An exciting game for sure, with the lead shifting back and forth a couple of times.

Actually Black had quite a good game going, a gentle reducing move was all he had to do to maintain his lead. But he invaded, daringly, and you did well to punish his overplay.

So I wouldn't feel too down having lost because of some simple oversight as you did here.
Things like that happen to everyone of us, and sadly they don't stop happening to you even when you reach dan level.

Your strong point seems to be fighting, and that's a good skill to polish in order to become stronger. So keep this fighting, sceptic spirit - if you can back it up with a sound strategic knowledge and a good feeling for shape, you have taken a major obstacle towards some ranks up. :)

I'd recomment you to work a bit on your opening strategy and on your sense for what are urgent and non-urgent moves.

If you aren't sure how to play against some certain kind of opening (i.e. the chinese fuseki), you can look up basically every pattern at gobase.org, check other pro game databases or get hold of a book dealing with the topic. Senseis.xmp.net of course has information on everything, too.
(On the chinese fuseki, by the way, there's this book "The Chinese Opening - The Sure-Win Strategy" by Kato Masao. Quite interesting stuff, with broad possibilities for application in your actual games.)

The other point is more difficult to train. Maybe it'd help to play over pro games and observe when and where they tenuki and when they don't.  
Replaying strong player's games has the nice side effect of teaching you a lot about shape, so maybe you'll consider it a good method to improve your go.

I hope there were some points of the review you found useful and that I didn't bore you with my chatty style.

(;B[rp]C[fey: A cute probing move. Acoording to White's answer, Black can plan his further invasion.

(In one of the vars I put one of my favorite go problems. I will never forget thinking almost one hour about it, having the solution in front of my mental eye and still not understanding that I had already solved it. It's also a nice little trick play to test your opponents with in your games.

If a kakari is necessary, White should at least try to play more lightly and chose the high move of E16.]

Accordingly White already has to think about a way of making sabaki, perhaps something like the marked point; but all in all Black will profit by this efforts on both sides again.]
