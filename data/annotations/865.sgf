C[Holo: Both players made good and solid moves. There were some slight mistakes espacially in the endgame. You should realize two proverbs.
a) Don't attach what you are attacking
b) Don't approach too close to strength (your own and this of your opponent)]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[nq];W[qn];B[pr]
(;W[rq]LB[qq:A]C[Holo: Unusual but ok. The usual move is at a, see variation]
;B[kp];W[fq]C[Holo: In general it is not good to play where your opponent is strong. White will live there if he wants, but black will get strength around it.]
;B[fp]
(;W[gq]LB[gp:A]C[Holo: Better at A, see variations.];B[gp];W[eq]
;B[dq]LB[ep:A]C[Holo: Easier for black is A.];W[ep]C[Holo: Good, this creates cutting points. But white can omit this move until he threatens to use them.]
;B[eo];W[hq];B[hp];W[iq];B[jq]LB[ip:A]C[Holo: That is a slight mistake by black. He should have played at A.]

(;W[dr]LB[ip:A]C[Holo: And white had to do that move too. see var]
;B[cr];W[er];B[do]C[Holo: Good move];W[nc]TR[cr][dq][dp][do]
[eo][fp][gp][hp][kp][ch]LB[ch:A][ce:B][cj:C]C[Holo: See the black wall. White should neutralize its strength by playing a A. A is the right place as it allows to extend to B if black playes at C.]
;B[oc]LB[cg:A]C[Holo: And black should have played immediately around A using his strength. The reason behind that is, that it it very difficult to invade between A and the black wall. White may loose his invading stones.]
;W[nd];B[qf];W[jc];B[pi];W[qk]C[Holo: Good, the white group is completely secure now.]
;B[cf]C[Holo: The biggest move on the board, but perhaps a little bit too far away from the wall.]
;W[fc]LB[ef:A][dj:B][ch:C][dh:D][di:E]C[Holo: White takes territory at the top, but blacks moyo increases. What had you done if black played at A or B now? So i prefer to play at C, D or E. Black is then able to run into the corner, but white gets a base at the left side, nullifying blacks influence.]
;B[bd];W[cb]C[Holo: See my first commentary for the local response.]
;B[ci]C[Holo: Works perfectly with the other stones.];W[cl]
LB[dk:A][ek:B][el:C]C[Holo: I think white realized the black moyo. So he invaded there. But now it is a little late and very dangerous. Black is VERY strong around here. What would you do against black A, B or C?]
;B[dl]C[Holo: Don't attach what you're attacking. The reason is, that both groups become stronger by those moves. A strong group is more difficult to attack.]

(;W[cm]LB[dm:A][dk:B]C[Holo: I prefer A or B. see var.];B[dm]
;W[dk]C[Holo: Dangerous]
(;B[ek]LB[ck:A]C[Holo: I would have played at A. see var.];W[dj]
;B[ej]LB[bj:A][cj:B]C[Holo: Black should think about a kikashi at A or even B. This destroyes white's eye shape, without strenghtening him.]
;W[di];B[dh];W[ei];B[fj]C[Holo: Bad shape. From a two stone 'wall' you can jump at least 1 stone.]
;W[eh];B[dg];W[eg];B[ef];W[cj];B[bi];W[bj];B[ff];W[gh]C[Holo: Now white escaped, :-), but
1) he is not completely secure and
2) black begins to secure territory in the center.];B[hj];W[he]
;B[kl]LB[pl:A][po:B]C[Holo: I prefer A or B. There is a reason behind that. You should not secure territory with strong groups as black does it here. but use it for attacking. A and B threaten to cut something off the white group or get an even bigger moyo in the center.]

(;W[oj]LB[ai:A][ip:B][bo:C]C[Holo: I think all group are settled now, and you have to count. Counting is very important, if you want to win. You must know whether to play solidly or aggressively.
 Of course you may not be able to count exactly, but you will know, if you a far behind or far ahead or the game is close. I myself loosed some won games because i played too aggressive moves. :-(
white:
30 points at the top
10 points at the bottom
20 points at the right
black:
25 points top right
10 points top left
10 points at the bottom
30 points in the center
So white is about 15 points behind. If white plays all the sente moves he should be able to win the game. But where is the biggest point on the board? I give some variations instead of the white move. On the other hand side you shoul examine your opponents possibilities. If you have to answer it is sente for him. Local areas where a black or a white move are sente must be occupied first.
I would have played first at A, then at B and wait how blacks responses, and then at C. Try to count after this moves.]
;B[oi];W[nj];B[pj];W[pk];B[qj]TR[qi][ri][si][ph][qh][rh][sh]
[pg][qg][rg][sg]MA[nk][ok][ol][nl][pl][pm][om][nm][nn][on][pn]
C[Holo: Notice that black has secured about 11 points of territory, while white gained little because his moyo is open to the center.]
;W[nl];B[ln]C[Holo: Good];W[ip]C[Holo: Good];B[io]
(;W[jp]LB[jo:A]TR[ln]C[Holo: Notive that the move at a may not be possible because of the presence of the marked stone.]
;B[jo];W[kq];B[lq];W[kr];B[lr];W[jr];B[lp]C[Holo: I think this is not necessary.]
;W[cn]LB[bo:A][cq:B]C[Holo: If white wants to take territory, A is easier. The white move leaves the possibility of black A. A also threatens the cut at B.]
;B[co];W[dn]C[Holo: Play move as this only if you want to cut, or in the very endgame. This looses 1 liberty, i hope it is not necessary for you later.]
;B[en];W[ni]LB[mh:A][mg:B]C[Holo: What is the purpose of this move? The white group is secure so you have not to flee. It does not surround any territory. If white wants to surround territory a move at A or B looks better.]
;B[og]LB[nh:A][ih:B]C[Holo: Locally better at A, but first a move around B seems simpler.]
;W[mf]C[Holo: Good];B[hf];W[if];B[ge];W[gd];B[fd];W[hd];B[hg]
;W[hh]LB[gg:A][fg:B][fi:C]C[Holo: Look out for kikashis. You must always decide wheter a move is possible later, or your opponent forces you with kikashi, and you have no chance to play the move. Here white can play first at A, threatening a cut and connecting with bamboo joint. If white doesn't doplay there black may play at B or C later, having a ko threat an and forces white into bad shape (empty triangle.)]
;B[ig];W[jf]LB[ih:A]C[Holo: Very dangerous. Is the white group alive if black plays at A?]
;B[ob]C[Holo: Very big.];W[nb]C[Holo: Good];B[jj]LB[nn:A][bn:B]
[ed:C]C[Holo: Small. A takes territory while reducing white's. B exploits the possibility of reducing whites eye shape. C prevent a white kikashi here.]
;W[ii];B[ij];W[jg];B[mg];W[ng]C[Holo: That does not work];B[nf]
