C[SC: Hi there and thanks for reviewing this.  I usually play on websites where I have 24 hours to contemplate moves and this game had only a minute per move.  I never felt confident this whole game and think I reacted too much instead of taking charge.  It was quite a surprise to me that I won and looking it over I'm not sure if it wasn't just a lucky win.  It seems the game was full of blunders and I would appreciate any comments about where the really large mistakes were.

rag: its not wrong to "react".  Each time your opponent plays a move, you are in a new position.  You must play according to what the position actually is.  So every move is, in a sense, a reaction.  However, the "position" is the whole board.  It is definitely wrong to "react locally".  Equally, you cannot expect to "take charge".  And you should not even try to!  

Sente and kikashi: kikashi is a move which forces the opponent to reply with a particular move (or suffer a huge loss).  Sente is also forcing, but the opponent has a variety of options.

However, what a player thinks is a sente or kikashi may not be so!

On blunders: Every move i make is a blunder in the sense that it is less than ideal, and sometimes makes my position worse!

Having looked through the whole game, my general feeling is that white is thoughtful, yet conservative and black is wild, yet skillful at local fights.  

In general, i think white can improve by reminding himself to stand back from the board and look at the overall position.  Ideally, one should do this on every move, but it requires a certain discipline of mind to tear oneself away from a local battle.  You can help yourself to do this by sitting with a straight rather than bent back and not leaning in too closely when reading.  

Another general principle is flexibility.  You must be willing to change your plan at every step.  Especially, be willing to let a couple of stones go to gain a positional advantage.

In my commentary, i've focussed on examples of situations in which i think these general principles show a better way to play.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[rag: fine so far :)];B[qo];W[mp]C[rag: this move is a bit funny to me.  it looks as if white is afraid of black making a large territory in front of his shimari.

But this is wrong thinking.  Both players are about the same strength, so each must expect the other to make some territory.

It would be better to look for a move which aims towards restricting black's territory whilst expanding white's framework.  Like K3 or K4 or even D10, which builds a strong side upon which later adventures and invasions can be based.

Another way to look at it is that N4 is  far away from D4 and white can expect black to separate these two stones.  The gap is so wide black can easily make a position in it, which will leave N4 drifting without a base.]
;B[jq];W[mn];B[fq]C[rag: a thin position for black leaving a potential weakness at H3 for white to aim at.  as white, i favour D6 with this in mind, expecting a black slide to D3 which would be purely defensive and giving white the intiative on one of the other 3 sides, whichever he likes.]
;W[dq]C[rag: this is not wrong, it does aim at H3 and does start to build some teritory on the left side.   But it feels a bit slow to me.  It encourages black to reinforce his bottom position, which can then turn to push around the floating white stones in the lower right, which are white's biggest liability at this stage.]
;B[fo];W[cm]C[SC: How is this opening?  I felt behind.

rag: i like your last move.  It stretches out towards D16 and treats N4 lightly.

But why on earth do you feel behind?  It is very significant that you feel like this, because your feeling is not based on objective analysis.  It is almost as if you felt afraid as soon as you saw the shimari, perhaps from previous experience.

But a shimari is a "slow" position, not something to fear!

Look at your two stones at N4 and N6.  As white, i would prefer them to be at K16 and Q10, for example.   They are not in danger of being captured soon as the middle is wide open.  But they will become a liability later on unless you give them somewhere to run to (like K16) or give them a bit of shape with K5.]
;B[dn]C[rag: a "thank you " move which achieves nothing except to strengthen white.]
;W[cn]C[rag: yes.];B[do]C[rag: thank you again.];W[co];B[el]
C[rag: black wasted his last two moves and now seems to be trying to justify them, losing sente in the process.  But it does cast a long shadow over towards N4, so white should probably do something about that now before its too late.  If he does so now, with K5 or somesuch, black's last 3 moves will all have been pointless.

On the other hand, if white doesnt do something, black can play K6 and make territory while attacking - the ideal technique.  That makes a pre-emptive settling move by white more urgent.]
;W[dm]C[rag:  what are you thinking?  there's a whole other board out there!]
;B[em];W[cj]C[rag: locally, this move gains about 8 points.  It is an endgame move, as white doesnt need it to make a base as C7 etc are already alive.  

But there are 4 sides on a board and so far two of them have still not been touched by either player.]
;B[cf]C[rag: jealousy move.  thank you black, for giving white something to attack.]
;W[cd]C[rag:  it may sound funny, but i think the best way to lean on C14 is indirectly, by stretching out the other way at F16 for example.  But your move is still ok.  like D3, it looks slow to me.]
;B[ef]C[SC: Later it ends up quite badly for me up top.  I'm unsure what went so wrong.

At his stage, it would be fine to repeat your pattern and play G17.  Black will have to do something to protect F14, giving you sente to do something on the right side or to look after your liability in the lower right.]
;W[nc]C[rag: too far from his friends, this kakari will become a lonely soul.  As a matter of principle, you must at the very least stop and ask yourself "how will black reply?".  You can do this by asking yourself "how would i reply if i were black?".  For myself, i would definitely play somewhere between D16 and O17.  Is that what you had in mind when you played O17?]
;B[fd];W[fc]C[rag: myopia is a handicap.  this move is not myopic, but the thinking behind it might be.]
;B[gc]C[rag: black's first good move, especially if he's willing to let E14 go to build a powerhouse in the upper right.]
;W[ec];B[gd];W[jc]C[rag:  skipping 3spaces is asking the opponent to hop in the middle and split the stones.  To settle O17, a 2-space skip to L17 is standard.  Especially as G16 is a strong wall, you shouldnt approach it too closely.]
;B[pc]C[rag: thanks black, for giving white the chance to settle his shape with M16.]
;W[ql]C[rag: white's worst move so far.  Now he has 3 weak groups.]
;B[lc]C[rag: impatient aggression.  Cutting through the gap between N6 and R8 would be more effective and larger scale.  M17 actually helps white, as the middle is still wide open.  If black wants to attack the top - as indeed he should - it would be better to do so indirectly, by first attacking the white stones in the lower right, building up a wall facing the top and then stabbing white in the heart later on.  To hop in so soon is premature.  Of course, white should have played M16 instead of R8 but that doesnt mean black should start stabbing right away.]
;W[ne]C[rag:  look in a book to see what happens if white sits on top of black at M16 instead.  That is a standard move.]
;B[pf];W[qh]C[SC: Looking now  I am unsure who is ahead at this point.  In the game I felt quite far behind.

rag: the 3-space skip is thin, so white has 3 weak groups.  it's hard enough trying to deal with 2 weak groups, in fact one should try never to have more than one weak group at a time.  so black is ahead.

but white is not "far behind".  In fact, white has more solid territory than black.  if he can avoid losing a big group, he can win.]
;B[qg]C[rag: thanks black.  after white replies with Q12 he will have reduced his liability from 3 weak groups to 2, a 50% improvement!]
;W[ph];B[ng]C[rag: black should ask himself: what happens if white cuts through my keima?]
;W[le]C[rag: nice move. white's best move so far.];B[kd]C[rag: small potatoes.  white should thank black.]
;W[kc]C[rag: ?? are you mad?! run away! run away!  you cant fight someone in front of you when his big brother is right behind you!!  K17 should be a sacrificial crumb you offer black in return for letting you run away and reduce his potential in front of G16 - L16 at the same time.]
;B[ld];W[lb]C[rag: maybe a pro could make the top live small, but i sure couldnt.  and why would i want to, when the middle is where all the action is / will be?]
;B[mb];W[ke]C[rag: better.  so long as it is played with the idea of sacrificing 3 or 4 stones now.]
;B[jd];W[hb]C[rag: yecch! gambler's ruin, throwing good money after bad.

how about O11 instead, building a position out of your lower weak groups from which you can stretch out to reduce black's middle left potential]
;B[gb];W[id];B[ie]C[rag: as black, i would never ( i hope) be so reckless.  just come out at K15 and white is cut in two eyeless halves.  

as white, i would think "oh good! now i can salvage something by playing K15 myself and then running away to the middle, although this would provoke black into something like O11 which threatens to cut me up lower down.  But, despite this side-effect,  having been offered the chance to cut my losses on the top, i would still play K15 and then L12 or soething like that.]
;W[mc]C[rag: white is blind.  does he not see M18 is one step from atari?]
;B[kb];W[je];B[la]C[rag: ok white, for the last time, run away! RUN AWAY!!]
;W[md];B[lb];W[nb]C[rag: sigh. this would have been a nice ko threat.

kikashi is not always a good idea.  this move forces black to play J17, which is just what he wants to do anyway.  black should say "thank you, white"]
;B[ic];W[hd]C[rag: ?? ok, this kind of brain numbness comes upon me too when i have totally stuffed it up and lost all vision.  That's one reason i'm stuck at 5kyu.

white needs to slap himself in the face every few moves (to wake himself up) and stand up and walk around to try and clear his head, especially after shooting himself in the foot so many times in the last 6 moves or so.

Because the loss is actually not so great (its now one more than it needed to be) but even so, white has  a bit of a wall, can still lean on black a bit (after jumping out to the middle) which also reaches out a helping hand to the lower weak white stones.

White's last move suggests he has forgotten the board has 4 sides and a middle.]
;B[hc];W[he];B[if];W[hf];B[ig];W[kg];B[hg];W[bg]C[rag: the endgame hasnt started yet.  there is still the huge empty area in the middle and 3 weak white groups to consider.]
;B[bf];W[cg];B[dg];W[dh];B[eh];W[di];B[ei];W[ej];B[dk];W[ck]
;B[dj];W[dl];B[ek];W[ci];B[fj];W[mh];B[nh]C[rag: now the danger to white should be more apparent, although these two black stones are not actually connected to the corner.

White needs to play carefully now.  well, of course, you nalways need to play carefully!

Forget about particular places, just look at it in terms of groups...white needs to stabilise the top and rescue the bottom. So (try to) join them up by hopping down the middle towards them; the right side will probably be cut off, but its a fairly stable shape (3-point jump from 2-stone wall) and should be able to take care of itself.

If w manages to liknk up, he can turn around and slice through the O13-K14 keima and give black a nasty shock.  But not yet. Not yet.]
;W[mj]C[rag: good!];B[ni];W[mi]C[rag: bad!  to slow, too shapeless.  i would have played L11]
;B[mg];W[lg];B[of]C[rag: ah, black has seen his flaw.  never mind, white now has sente.  somewhere halfway between the white wall and the black one (like K10) should be ok]
;W[pb]C[rag: yose move];B[qb];W[qc];B[ob];W[oc];B[pa]C[SC: I felt far behind here and considering resigning.  I'm unsure where black lost the game if it was just a big misread or something else.

rag: in my opinion, white went wrong when he played N4.  the debacle at the top turned out not so bad, ecept for the madness of H15 etc.

But the game is still wide open.  black has a small lead in solid territory, but not so great it cannot be erased.  the middle is where the action is - or should be!]
;W[rn];B[ro];W[nj];B[jj]C[rag: good move];W[jo]C[rag: well, better late than never!]
;B[ko]C[rag: black is greedy.  this gives white a chance to catch up.]
;W[kn];B[lo];W[ln];B[mo];W[no];B[np]C[rag: black needs to be more thoughtful.   naked aggression can backfire]
;W[kp];B[jp];W[nq];B[io]C[rag: a good move by black, making use of his dead stones]
;W[lp];B[jn]C[rag: i dont like this move.  what if w plays K7?  so as black i would rather play K7 myself instead of this.]
;W[jm];B[in];W[il];B[im];W[jk]C[rag: a solid connection would not leave a weakness at L7]
;B[kk]C[rag: if it works, it is a strong move.  if it doesnt, it is an overplay.  did black read out what happens after white cuts at L10?

what's the difference betwen black L9 and black L10?  one point?  one point can turn a pro game, but not a kyu one.]
;W[kl];B[kj];W[ij];B[hl];W[ii];B[jh];W[ji];B[ki]C[rag: ?? black is not even looking one move ahead!]
;W[kh];B[oj];W[pj];B[qm];W[rm];B[om]C[rag: a strong move by black.]
;W[pm]C[rag: a weak reply by white, just what black wants.  Q8 is i think stronger, making black connect at Q7 the white can push on to P8 securing territory on the other side (as there is still the cutting point at P11).  

But this way, while white is busy picking up one stone, black bounces off him into white's middle.

Someone once said "anyone who cannot see in two directions at once has no business playing Go".]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[oo];W[op];B[pp];W[oi]C[rag: too late, doesnt work now. i prefer O8.]
;B[ok];W[ol];B[nl];W[pk];B[pl];W[ml];B[mm];W[lm];B[mk];W[nk]
;B[ll]C[rag: white must be feeling a bit sick.  how did he let black get away with this?]
;W[lk];B[lj]C[rag: black has overreached himself (a step too far...) white cannot play M11 right now because of damezumari, but after P8 he gains (more than) the one liberty he needs and black's 4 stones (now 5) will die.]
;W[lh]C[rag: white missed his chance.  he is lucky black cannot connect at P8 and cut off the upper white goup, which has no eyes of its own.  only black's overstep at L10  putting himself in damezumari is saving white from total disaster.]
;B[ml];W[li]C[rag: waste of a ko threat.  just save yourself at P8]
;B[lk];W[ol];B[nm];W[nn]C[SC: From here I thought I was well ahead and actually half expected black to resign.  It seemed to me my end game was riddled with mistakes and very passive maybe too much so to review :) but maybe you could point out the biggest one or biggest missed opportunity.

rag: you say you thought you were well ahead.  did you make a rough count?  let's try:

white: top left = 6; left side = 30, right side = 15, bottom = 3, prisoners = 2*12=24.  total 78

black: top = 8+2*7=22; top right = 17, bottom right =10, left centre = 27, total 71

so the difference is quite small for a kyu match; the game is still anyone's

the biggest yose points are the ones along the imaginary boundaries bewteen the black and white positions.  like E2, M2, P2 , S12, plus there are two monkey jumps in the top left corner

now, what if black oplays C18? is it worth taking the risk?  i would defend the possibility and stop one monkey jump at the same time.  small, slow, but careful and safe.  even if 7 points behind, there is till time to catch up.  but to lose the top left corner would be terminal.]
;B[rh];W[ri];B[rg];W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[lr];W[mr];B[kr];W[be]
;B[ag];W[ah];B[af];W[bh];B[bc]C[rag: ok, here we go.  if you were black, how would you plan to live?  where would you plan to live?  now you know this, how can you as white stop him doing that?]
;W[cc]C[rag: this is the safest approach but it lets black connect.  if instead you played B16 to keep him apart, how could he live?  he might start with C18....and then?]
;B[cb]C[rag: ye gods! black is running beserk! he refuses to connect, keep his lead and win.  instead he wants to kill all the white stones!!

lets see, if you let him play B19 and A18 he will live.  So dont let him take both those points.  Also, if you let him play D19 or F19 he can connect along the top.

Now, whose turn is it?.....];W[db]C[rag: yes. good.];B[ae];W[bb]
;B[ab];W[ca]C[rag: ....and black loses sente.  thanks, black!]
;B[fb];W[ce]C[rag: ? B16 or P2 or....];B[ad];W[eb];B[ed];W[ba]
C[rag: yes. dont let him make a one-sided ko.];B[oq]C[rag: thanks, black. P2 is bigger anyway.]
;W[np]C[rag: oh! i thought you were going to play P2?!];B[or]
;W[nr]C[rag: G1 or T11  bigger
