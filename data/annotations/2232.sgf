;B[pp];W[dp]C[requesters comment: i want to know when white is setting me up and what the stronger player is thinking at the different stages of the game]
;B[od];W[dd];B[fc];W[eg];B[jd];W[qd];B[cf]C[where is the big point here? should i respond to r16 or take the fight elsewhere?

Two things: First: I would respond to r16. You played p16 to get outside influence. You should press on r16 to get this influence naturaly. Now white can play something like p17 (see variation).

Second: Around c14 is not a place I would consider to play. It is the strongest region of white. IKf black likes to play tenuki f3 would be better. A white play in the upper left corner is too slow and even if white plays a move like d17 there is still aji left.]

Black is trying too hard. He should think about not to rescue every stone and not to attack too hard.
It is often better to play nobi instead of a hane to have less cutting points. See the upper right success for white.

Very important is not to play where the opponent is strong. Examples are the invasions in the upper and lower left. Just play elsewhere.

Try these two advices and I'm shure youre game will improve a lot. :-)]
