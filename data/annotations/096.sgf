C[Hmmm.  Since the marked stone is so far away, perhaps a move like b is better?]

(;B[qi];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qg]M[oq]C[Again, the marked stone is too far away... it is better to build thickness on the top, since it will take too many moves to make territory in the lower right. (c is a better choice than b)]

(;B[ql]M[dd]C[a is bad for white, I think.  I would be sorely tempted to play b here, reducing the thickness of the top, and making ideal use of the marked stone.  As corner invasions go, it is probably better to play high here.]

(;W[qp];B[po];W[pq];B[pp]M[qi][ql][po][oq][jp]C[The marked stones show how poorly chosen the corner invasion was.]
;W[qr];B[pr];W[qq];B[qo];W[or];B[nr];W[ps];B[nq];W[jc]C[a seems too passive to me.  unfortunately, I don't see a good alternative immediately.  Maybe b? c?]

(;B[lc];W[je];B[df]M[je]C[Your are lucky white didn't attack immediately.  Since he has the marked extension, his corner is secure, and he can pressure 31.]
;W[fd]M[df]C[a is too far.  Also, you started your invasion high, to play on the third line here seems indecisive.  b is closer to your stone, c seems strong, even d looks good.]

(;B[cj];W[cl]M[cj]C[b is almost obligatory, I think, since the marked stone is so far from the corner invasion.  You seem too worried that your opponent might make some territory.  Thinking like this will leave you with weak groups and no cash of your own.  b bolsters your strength for your weak stones, while c or d are merely gigantic moves. It should be obvious that both c and d are much bigger than a.]

;B[dg];W[ci];B[bh];W[di];B[bi];W[dj];B[ck];W[dk]C[a is tiny. Again, the big moves are to create a moyo...]

(;B[fr]C[a is too passive.  Better b, or ideally, c.]
(;W[fm]C[a is still too small.  Your chance for a moyo is what will win the game.  You must grab it while you can.]

(;B[go]C[a merely strengthens your stones.]
(;W[fp];B[gp];W[fs];B[gs];W[es];B[gr]C[a is big, but it is yose.]
(;W[bl]C[I think 64 was sente against your corner, but, even if it is, a is a very large move. perhaps it is big enough to justify leaving the corner.]

(;B[hm]C[At this point, white has to take drastic measures to reduce your moyo.  Maybe even d?]

[ed];W[ec];B[ee];W[fc];B[ge];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[le];W[og];B[oi]C[This is the end of the game.  Your 83 was a fine move, that drove white to desperation.]

(;W[jn];B[jl];W[ln];B[ll];W[nl];B[mk]C[I have a hard time seeing life for white here...]

(;W[kp];B[kq];W[jq];B[ip];W[lq];B[kr]C[b is the only move.]
