C[Thanks for reviewing the game. I have added what I was thinking during the game to help you find my weaknesses.

These thoughts start with ***


----
Overall your play seemed OK.  The biggest mistakes I say were the atari at 50 and leaving the white group in the lower right unattended for so long.  Fortunately your opponent didn't pressure that group either, so you came out fine.

If you're curious about corner sequences, http://dailyjoseki.com/browse has a joseki dictionary based on how pros play in that situation.  You can see the standard corner responses and learn them.  But it's very important to understand why a move is played, not just what move is played.  Hopefully I helped with that a little bit.]

C[F16 better?

---
F17 is the joseki move.  The two space extension looks safe, but actually there is some bad aji around E17.]
;B[ep]C[Black is leaving off the protect move on the side, I'd look for a side play here]

(;W[po]C[*** I prefer to break the board up into many pieces so I made sure I got a stake in these two corners early.

Is that why pros do this? I'm sure there is another reason.


---
I think either way is fine, this move seems fine to me.  I have a slight preference for the D6 area because of black's weakness as I said on move 12, but Q5 is big also.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]C[If you want to end in sente, you can tennuki here]

(;W[pm];B[nq]
(;W[eq]C[Is a move at R10 needed? if so, is it more urgent that playing at e3?


---
I think R11 is probably a little better here.  Don't leave yourself with too many weak groups.]

(;B[fq];W[dq];B[gp];W[cm]
(;B[ec]C[*** should this be cuttable?

Did I respond correctly?

---

I think black is trying to force this too early. Your response was good.]

[dg]C[This fight went well for white, you can attack the D15 group]
;B[pk]
(;W[ok]C[*** trying to keep access to the centre rather than being closed in.

Maybe I should have jumped to the centre. If there where three stones along Q5,6,7, then I would jump to N6, but with the stones not connected, what is the ideal jump?


---
This is the danger of not playing R11.  But you don't want to attach to enemy stones.  I like N6.]
;B[pl];W[nm]C[If you're going to play this, don't play p9.  You just made black stronger]
;B[om];W[oo]C[This was a mouse slip. Would have preferred to play p6]

How you played was fine.  White can't lose now, except by making a big blunder.  E15 probably kills the upper left group, I don't see black making an eye on the side.
