(;B[cf]C[I would have played D8 here, C8 is very passive and gives white the initative. The stone a D9 makes D8&D9 a strong pair of stones. 

D8 also forces white onto the defensive at the end of the continuation.]

;W[gf]C[White doesn't really have to play this defensive move here because his stone on E7 has 3 liberties. 

If you had played D8 instead of C8 as I suggested then the stone on E7 would only have 2 liberties. Now if white doesn't play a defensive move you woukd be able to break white's line.]

(;B[dl]C[Again this move is too passive.

You should have played on the third line with perhaps E3. You shouldn't play the second line in a situation like this and play the third line instead.

If white responds to E3 with E4 you can play D3. 

If white responds to E3 with D3, you can play E4.];W[ck];B[cl]

The purpose of playing F4 was to break into white's territory and ruin as much of their territory as possible. 

See continuation.]

The only thing I can think of is that you were worried about white playing G1? However, you can kill G1 immediatley with F1.]

This is my first review so I hope it wasn't too bad. :)
