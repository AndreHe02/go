C[Game reviewed by Allan Wickberg, sep 06. Comments marked "al>".

This is a game against a 16k on IGS.
I put some thinking in the file when I reviewed it myself but I would like someone to have a look to see if I m right or not.

I think the big points are at: 12, 21, 33, 43, 47, 60, 87, 91, 101, 140, 147, 203, 228

But feel free to make any comment.

I m especially interested in comments on the opening since I ve studied it recently :-) I think it went wrong here...

If you have any idea on thinks I should study more, I m interested...

Thanks very much.

al> You are welcome, and thanks for giving me the opportunity to review another game - it is always educating, for the reviewer as well.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[op];B[pn]C[al> Q6 is fairly OK because of the black stone at Q16. I think I would have played at Q3 or R7, though, since it is safer to stick to the third line in the opening.]
;W[lq];B[dq];W[do];B[fp]C[al> At #5, Q6 was OK, but here F4 does not have friendly stones to support it the same way Q16 works with Q6. Therefore, I would think that G3, C4 or a pincer at C7 would have been better.]
;W[cl];B[cf];W[ce]C[I think white made a mistake here...
Am I Right?

al> I am afraid you are not - white can play like this because he has friendly stones on the other side of the black stone to support C15. The black stone is severly pressed now, as you can see later.]
;B[df]C[It strengthens me...
???

al> Yes, but...];W[fd]C[al> ...white gets the opportunity to build a huge corner while black is still under pressure.

al> If you want to know if an exchange has been good or bad for you, imagine (or use an SGF editor :) what the board would look like if the last stones were swapped. Black at F16 and white at D14 would look better for black, withthe potential of dominating the upper right of the board.

al> Sometimes it is better to let go of a stone and just wait and see if it unexpectedly swings back to life in the endgame. Stones which are "dead as they stand" can often enough be leveraged later in the game.]
;B[cj]C[al> C11 is too far from C14. It should be at C11 to make the group comfortable. Imagine white playing C12 now..]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[hp];W[ip]
(;B[jc]C[I may have missed the point on the lower side?

Was the variation better?

al> The benefit of pushing through with G4-H4 are that it builds a wall that can be used to attack white D5 and C8. It does not secure territory for black, and it does not make the corner safer for black,  and it does not destroy any significant potential for white.

al> So the push should prbably be followed by a move such as C6 to make sense.]
;W[ep]
(;B[eq]C[al> One thing that black has repeatedly trouble with in this game is staying connected. Black E3 here allows white to cut, and thereby split the black groups. Black F3 works better. See variation on how to keep connected.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eo]C[al> E5 is going in the wrong direction - the corner is much bigger than the territory white gets by capturing the G4 group. Black also has plenty of access to the center, so the G4 group is not important for destroying white potiential towards the center, either.

al> E5 forces white to come down on the black D3 group, practically giving white the corner.

al> D4 is better to use the G4 group to settle the corner instead. See variation.]
;W[dp];B[fn];W[en];B[fo];W[em];B[fm]C[al> This formation is not optimal, since it has few liberties, considering how many stones are in the group. H6 would be better for creating eye space for the group.]
;W[fl]
(;B[fj]C[33 my not be at the right place???

Variation is any better?

al> No, and no. There is still time for black to get the lower left corner, since white went after the F4 group instead. C3 would save many points for black, considering the scenario of white taking bothe the corner as well as the F4 group.]
;W[ek];B[ej];W[gm];B[hn];W[gk];B[gj];W[hk];B[hj];W[ij]
(;B[qj]C[Urgent before Big!
43 was big I think but I should have took care of my group on the left before?

Variation is any better?

al> The F4 group is 14+ points. The lower left corner is about 25 pts. THe right side may be 15 points or thereabouts. LL corner is big AND urgent.]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[pg]C[Another Big before Urgent mistake?

al> Yes, LL corner still relevant. Also, since Q13 is on the fourth line, the upper right corner and down along the right side is still open for invasion despite Q13.

al> To seal the upper right corner, O17 would be good, as it strenghtens the K17 stone as well. The black stones at the lower right will probably live on their own, but K17 cous get pretty lonely if white would play around O17.

al> Furthermore, looking at the next few moves, black would do well by playing R5, S5 or S4 now to strengthen the lower right.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[al> I tried to compare what actually happened with doing R16 isntead of Q17, and I think Q17 is better, since black can play S13 eventually, and seal black in securely. See variation.]

;W[rr]C[I don't exactly what went wrong here but it went all wrong...

al> Try to always stay connected. The S3-T3 stones became a "low hanging banana" here.]

(;B[sq]C[al> I favour S4 here, to avoid the cut. See variation. S5 works, as well.]
;W[qo]C[al> Too late for S4 or S5 now.];B[qn];W[ro]
(;B[rp]C[al> S4 just becomes another prisoner. Better to limit damage by blocking at S6.]

Variation is better!

al> Yes. E2 makes an open triangle, which makes for a weaker black group, while at the same time not reducing liberties for the white group.]
;W[fr]
(;B[es]C[al> Black got short on liberties because of bad shape here. The kind of triangle shape that the E2 group forms is inefficient in terms of liberties even before E1. See variation for an escape route.]

(;B[oj]C[al> P10 is questionable. The R10 group is not in as much danger as the J6 group, so black should play in the other direction. O10 would be good, since white would have to care for his P9 group, which would give black the opportunity to play P10 as a follow-up.]

White didn't take the kill right now but really later.
I could have save the group until 228.

My group of 3 is in danger too. Didn't see!


al> Bad shape will always haunt you throughout a game. The triangle shape of  the F4 group is what makes it possible for white to render black a false eye by playing G6.]

It was cutting white in two, really important group I think.]

(;B[le]C[al> This is a crucial move. The row of black stones along line 15 really gives black nothing, at the same time, white gets loads of territory along the top. Going in the other direction would be better. See variation.]

There is also an extra cut at H5 for white to exploit, since the ladder is broken by C8. Also, white can still play E3 but this time there are more black stones to worry about than in the original sequence.]
