AB[dd][dj][dp][pd][pj][pp]C[Hello, I'm starting go (3 months), from now on i have solved problems at goproblems.com but played only 10 games in real.

So i don't know about fusekis and joseki and how to start a game properly yet...

What i noticed in the games i played so far is that i always build central moyo and often loose because my opponent has bigger territory along edges and corner.

In this game it is the same, i won it only because my opponent blundered a few times and gave me many prisonners, but i'm not satisfied with that, with 6 stone advantage i should have had some territory along the edges, and as you will see, i failed.

I commented some positions thoughout the game, so if you can anwser some questions, i will be happy.

========

J:  Hi!  I'm Justin and I used to be 8k, but these days I'm around 12-14k.  It was a pleasure to review your game, but there's not much to point out.  Just the two strategic issues I talk about at the end.  All beginning go players run into the same pitfalls and it just takes playing several games to begin to see them.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[co];B[bn]C[J:  Not solid enough.  Gives W time to counterattack.]
;W[bq];B[cr];W[bo];B[eq];W[dr];B[ds];W[ep];B[er];W[do];B[dq]
;W[cn];B[eo]C[Here i played E5 in order to isolate E4 stone, is it right or should i better play F4 to secure the lower edge ?


J:  This seems proper.  F4 would be more solid for you, but would making life too easy for W.  Your bottom group is strong enough for now and the cut is bad for W.  What's worth thinking about is playing elsewhere.  Reinforcing your corners and sides early on is a good way to make use of handicap stones.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[gp];B[hp]C[I'm always afraid of stones escaping like this and making a straight line. So i put H4 stone to stop the progression but white G5   quasi kills F5 group. Should i defend or focus on something else ?


J:  The problem with H4 is that it cannot hope to stop their escape so it is a wasted move.  Remember the proverb "don't touch the stones you wish to attack."  H4 has given W time to breath and you've fallen a little behind.

At this point, the local battle needs attention or you risk giving him too much.  So yes, you should defend by strengthening one of your two groups.  D3 is strong but could come under attack so maybe play H3 or H2.  E5 is a cutting stone and you always want to keep cutting stones alive, so jumping to E7 or F7 is best.  Both areas are about equally important.]
;W[go];B[gm];W[fn];B[hn];W[ho];B[io];W[ip];B[hq];W[gq];B[iq]
;W[jp];B[jo];W[kp];B[jq];W[ko]C[And here it's exactly the same as my previous comment. I do not manage to deal with L shape.


J:  It's always too hard to try and surround and kill in this direct way.  You must also focus on the safety of your own groups.]
;B[gr];W[fr];B[fs];W[en];B[fq];W[kq];B[im];W[jr];B[hr];W[ir]
;B[hs]C[J:  This move is too small.  You don't need it to stay alive and it gains only 1 pt of territory.  You could have played at O3 instead and began to erase the L4 group's foundation and simultaneously strengthened your corner.

Time is always important so never waste it playing small moves, they can be saved for later.  Avoid playing on the 2nd and 1st line until the end game.  Also, always look for moves that do two (or more) things at once.]
;W[is]C[J:  There's one of those blunders you mentioned  =P]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[js];W[bm];B[gn]C[J:  Still too small.  Doesn't help you much and W is far too strong now to attack.  Think more like O3, Q2, R7, K17, C13, C17, etc.]
;W[fm];B[mn];W[kn];B[km];W[jn];B[in];W[jm];B[hl]C[Here i though making an eye would secure my group, is it a good option or somrthing like J8 or K8 is preferable ?


J:  K8 is bad.  It tries to surround when it's not possible.  Better to let him poke through and make good shape yourself, so you played correctly.  Your other options were J8, G8, or H9, but I think I like this.]
;W[il];B[gl];W[fk];B[fl];W[el];B[fj];W[hk];B[ik];W[jl];B[gk]
;W[hj];B[ek]C[J:  Nice sequence.  You played it close, but survived and kept W separated.  But be careful W doesn't invade at C13 or your dragon could be nullified.]
;W[gj];B[dl];W[em];B[dm];W[cl];B[dn];W[an];B[eo];W[fo];B[eo]
C[Well, ok white did blunder big, but what's concerns me now (looking at final position) is that with such advantage i was unable to secure at least the upper left edge. What should be my priority :
- put some stones on row 10 ?
- attack H10 group ?
- playing somewhere around K12 for influence ?
- play K16 to finish fuseki ?


J:  Oh wow.  Didn't expect that.  After that, you can do whatever you want.  In general, you mostly have stones on the 4th line.  Play some in the corners or sides on the 3rd line to balance them out and make big moyos.  I would suggest the areas around O3, C13, K17 in that order.  Also, playing K10 to keep your cutting stone alive would be painful for W.]
;W[cm];B[en]C[J:  Not necessary.];W[ck];B[cj];W[bj];B[ch]C[J:  Too submissive.  THIS is the move that gives W the left edge.  Playing B11 instead dams the W flood.  If W defends at A10 or B9, THEN you play C12 and the top-left edge becomes yours (you'd still need one more move in the corner to prevent invasion there, tho).]
;W[ci];B[di];W[bi];B[dh]C[J:  Playing this move at B12 instead might have stopped the flood, too.]
;W[bh];B[df]C[Is it bad ? My defense clearly gives the edge to white. Should i be more agressive and play B13 ?


J:  No, if you play B13, W plays B14.  Then if you play low to cut him off, W surrounds you from above.  If you take the time to connect on top, W has time to connect on bottom.  So you've missed your chance to play on the 2nd line.  The real mistake was earlier.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[cf];B[gi]C[J:  Wrong priorities.  Remember, corners first, then sides, and then the center.  The center is the hardest place to defend and the hardest to make territory, so better to concentrate on corners and edges first.]
;W[ij];B[lk];W[jk];B[ll];W[lm];B[mm];W[kl];B[ml]C[Since white group is strong, i'm trying to secure bottom right area.


J:  This move secures the right side but this is not needed.  It was already secure.  You don't need to fear W's cut at N8 because you can play O8 to catch it in a ladder.  If you want to secure the bottom right, O5, O3, R3 or something like that would be better.]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[no];B[oo];W[op];B[pn];W[pq];B[qp];W[qq];B[rp]
C[But i give up the corner too easily and lots of territory. How can i be more strong in the corner ?


J:  To have protected this corner better, you should have pressed harder with move 110.  Move 114 could have been at Q3, but that would start a dangerous fight.

But really, this isn't so bad.  The area around R8 becomes very secure and if you can also secure around R13, your moyo gets huge.]
;W[rq];B[sp]C[J:  Too small.  Now is the time to play bigger moves like K17 or R13, etc.]
;W[sq];B[ki]C[J:  The right idea, make a big moyo.  But wrong priorities.  Stones on the 4th line do not at all mean the edge is yours.]
;W[qj];B[qi];W[ri];B[qk];W[rj];B[rh]C[My fight is poor, i'm unconfortable although white stones are surronded by lot of black stones. I don't understand how to stop an invasion when it happens...


J:  Best way is not to panic.  Remember W is already outnumbered, so the most important thing is to not leave behind weak groups that W can attack to gain strength.  Keep your stones actually connected.  When one of your single stones has two enemy stones attached (R11), you'll almost always want to extend from it (R12).  This move is hopeless and I bet you sensed that before you played it.]
;W[qh];B[pi];W[rg];B[qg];W[sh];B[ph];W[rh];B[rk];W[qf];B[pg]
;W[qe];B[sf]C[J:  This move doesn't come close to accomplishing what you want.  A wasted turn.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[rd];B[pe];W[qd];B[pc];W[pf];B[of];W[qc];B[oe]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[pa];B[nc]C[J:  If you play at P19, it forces W to defend.  Otherwise you can capture two stones with R18.  Either way, this is the right idea.  Now you should be aiming at the top center.

At this point, W's invasion is officially a huge success.  When dealing with an invasion, kill it if you can but at least contain it.  If you can press an invasion towards the edge it usually gives you a solid wall.  Then you can play something like K17 or K18 and you've used his invasion against him.]
;W[oa];B[na];W[qb];B[og]C[J:  Not necessary.  Study the ladder.  It will make you less afraid of being cut.]
;W[mb]C[Once again, the upper territory should be mine, but from this single stone, white will manage to extend along the whole edge and even corner.
I always seem to defend the central moyo and never manage to reduce white invasions to their minimum.


J:  Invasions can throw you off balance, but if you stay calm and patiently deny the invading group enough room to live, it will wither and die on the vine.]
;B[nb];W[lb];B[kb]C[J:  Again, "don't touch the stones you wish to attack."  Directly touching your opponent's stones actually makes them stronger.  If you were to answer at K17 or K18, you deny W enough room to live, but leave yourself enough room that you can't easily be counterattacked.]
;W[kc];B[ih]C[J:  Not at all the time to tennuki!!  You need to save L18 or there was no point in playing it in the first place.  THIS is the mistake that gave W the top.]
;W[jb];B[gc];W[id];B[ie];W[hc];B[ke];W[je];B[jf];W[jd];B[he]
;W[gd];B[ge]C[J:  Again, wrong priorities.  Here you have a choice to defend the edge (F17) or the center (G15).  You probably would have ended up with more points by protecting the edge first.]
;W[fc];B[fd];W[gb];B[ed]C[From here i decided to go in yose, but was something possible in upper right corner ?


J:  You're correct, most large points have been decided.  W cannot be attacked anywhere, so forget that.  You still need to patch the hole in your wall around M16.  The top left corner is undecided but there aren't a lot of points there.]

;W[rl];B[sj];W[rm];B[sk];W[sm];B[pk];W[qn];B[rn]C[J:  Overplay and unnecessary.]
;W[ro];B[qm];W[sn];B[qo];W[rn];B[ql];W[pm];B[so];W[mh]C[J:  Completely pointless]
;B[li]C[J:  Unnecessary];W[jj];B[ii];W[kk];B[eh]C[J:  Unnecessary.  If you poked through at C16, W couldn't stop you and you could erase 15-20 points of his territory.]
;W[ln];B[ld];W[lc];B[if]C[J:  Unnecessary];W[hd];B[dk]C[J:  Unnecessary]
;W[cd]C[J:  Letting W paint the inside of your wall like this is terrible.  You gave him the biggest corner possible without a fight.  Again comes back to your priority of playing in the center first.]
;B[br];W[ap];B[ar];W[aq];B[ls];W[ms];B[ks];W[mr];B[mp]C[J:  Pointless]

[rs][sa][sb][sc][sd][se][sf][sg][sr][ss]C[J:  So two things to think about in future games.  1)  If you want to surround a group, don't touch it.  Be patient and surround it from a distance, but not so far that you give your opponent eyespace.  2)  Change your priorities.  Handicap stones are too easy to invade and slip under.  Instead of protecting the center and trying to make territory there, throw some stones on the 3rd line in the corners and sides to more easily secure bigger territories.

Think about it:  to secure center territory, you have to build 4 walls.  To secure side territory, you must build 3.  Corner territory only takes 2 walls.  Make a strong corner then use it to branch into the sides.  Build a strong side to branch into the center.  It's tempting to play for the center because it's harder for you to be attacked.  Unfortunately, it's also the hardest way to make points.

Hope this helps  =)])
