C[Hi,

I played a slightly 'experimental' fuseki in this game, and it didn't work out at all as I expected!  Usually my style is quite territorial, and I am trying to learn how to build influence and attack on a large scale.  I am especially interested in your thoughts on the first 70 moves.  I thought I was doing OK up to move 73, then I went a bit crazy and things fell apart...

Thanks for taking the time to review this game.

Alex.];B[jj];W[pd];B[pp];W[dq];B[dd];W[do];B[jp];W[qj];B[jd]
;W[cj];B[oj];W[qm];B[qo]C[Alex: Is this move too slow?  Can you suggest anything else?

It strikes me as a bit slow since w can invade at Q2, so it's not taking much, but it's not a bad move.

If I were black, I might play O17 instead of R5.  I'd also consider C13 for black.]
;W[ph];B[qc];W[qd]C[Alex: What happens if white blocks on the other side?  I'm wondering about the sequence: w Q17, b R16, w R15, b S15, w S14.

I like this side because it works well with Q12.

In fact, it works so well that I question R17.

Maybe O17 better than R17 since it works well with K17, and still leaves invasion possible on right.]
;B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb]C[
Not sure about O18 since white N17 hurts black's potential in upper left.

How about black S16 instead of O18.];W[mc];B[rd];W[re];B[rc]
C[Alex: I thought that white's next move would be R14.  I got a surprise...]
;W[gd]C[
Black behind in territory.  This can be ok when playing a high infulential game as black has chosen, as long as black can use attacking potential as a way to catch up.  It's unclear how black is going to do this now.]
;B[df];W[gg]C[
for Black, I might consider C12 instead of D11 so as to make some solid territory in upper left, which facilitates better a possible attack on the two white stones at G13, and also an invasion at C7 later.]
;B[di];W[jf];B[le]C[
black had some potential for territory in the M8 area, but if black becomes too busy saving the top stones at M15, white builds power at N12 area which means not much left for black to build in M8 area.]
;W[ke]C[
white should attack these 2 black stones en masse rather than try to separate them.  How about M13 instead of L15.

for black, instead of answering L15 at L16, how about Q11 then P12.

Also, black E17 is a large move, which combined with the fact that N18 is open and that N18 isn't sente for white, it's not so large right now to let white play L16, given what black can get with his moves that he makes as he ignores L15.]
;B[kd];W[ld];B[lc];W[md]C[Alex: Now I had a hard time choosing between three possibilities: M18, N18 or K15.  What do you recommend?  Is there anything else I should think about?]
;B[je]C[
maybe black should play M18 without atari at K15 first.];W[kf]
;B[lb];W[lj]C[Alex: This move took me by surprise, again.  I feel as though I should try to attack strongly, but I couldn't think of a good way.  For example, if I play M12 next, then white L11, I can't find a good continuation.


How about black H15 which is an attack that works well with the D11 stone ?]
;B[om]C[P17 leaves a bad hole at Q6.  P17 has bad relation with R5.    Instead of P7, maybe Q8, and if white answers at R8, then black can continue with P6 .]
;W[ll];B[ln]C[Alex: Maybe this was too ambitious?

How about forcing at Q8 instead of M6.  If white answers at R8, then block at C11 to make territory and threaten to invade.  If white answers C11 at D10, the 2 stones are too far away from D5 (they should be one line closer).]
;W[ko]C[instead of pushing behind now with black L4 and M4, how about answering L5 with black M3 .black can aim for G3 also.]
;B[kp];W[lo];B[lp]C[pushing from behind with L4 and M4 is often bad....]
;W[mo];B[np];W[pn];B[on];W[qq]C[Alex: Now I have a difficult choice.  Is there any way to kill the invasion?

I don't think so.  You got hurt by pushing from behind.];B[pq]
C[
maybe R4 is better to cramp white as much as possible.  if white answers black r4 with white q2, black q3 looks effective, threatening to capture the 3-3 stone.  also note that if black r4, white q2, black q3, white q2, black cuts with atari .]
;W[po];B[oo];W[qp];B[ro];W[rp]C[
as black, i'm interested in the potential for R8, so I don't want to force too much in other ways if it ruins this potential.  The R8 sort of pressure helps black save the P10 stone in sente.]
;B[qr];W[rr];B[sp];W[rq]C[Alex: I think if I play S1 next, it starts a ko, but it's a bad ko for black.]
;B[pr];W[rn];B[dj];W[ck]C[
this black D10 really hurts him because now w firms up his territory and there's no more good invasion at C7.  I really liked C11 for black instead.]
;B[dk];W[dl]C[the D8 hane instead of C8 quiet move makes black C11 more powerful.  

Note that black is making the pushing-from-behind mistake again with D10 and D9 (white is playing ahead of black with C9 and C8)]
;B[el]C[Alex: Next I expected white D7, and then I have to decide on the best way to attack the G16 stone.]
;W[ci];B[dm];W[cl]C[Alex: This is where I went crazy!  I think I should play D12 next.

Up to this point I feel as though I'm slightly ahead.  White has more settled territory, but black has good potential for attacking, e.g, at G15, N7, R15. Is this a reasonable assessment?

white is threatening to make big territory by playing P9.  Also, white has C17 invasion, so I don't see black making much with G15.  Also, C12 still open.

G3 is a large play for both players.

Black's problem is that the C11,C10,C9 stones for white are giving white much more than the D11,D10,D9 black stones are giving to black.]
;B[cm];W[dh]C[
black's potential is now in lower left corner since white let black leak in.]
;B[eh]C[
instead of this E12 for black, I like E6 for black, which can be followed by G3 or B5.]
;W[em]C[
this is why i wanted black E6 .];B[dg];W[ch];B[fl];W[en]C[
white got very large here.  this is painful for black.  black is too fixated on attacking the g16 stone up top, which just isn't very large while upper left corner still open, plus white strong at k14.]
;B[ge];W[fe]C[
what if white answered at J15 instead of f15 ?  that press by white at j15 combined by pressing at n18 can give black trouble here.]
;B[ff];W[fg];B[ee];W[eg]C[
what if instead of white e13, white ataris at h15 ?];B[fd];W[ei]
C[
this white atari at e12 not very important since the white stones on left strong and don't need more.]
;B[qe];W[rf]C[
looks like white should atar at q15 instead of s14.];B[od];W[pe]
;B[oe];W[pf];B[me];W[of];B[mb];W[cc]C[Alex: This was my other big mistake.  If I just block at D17, I think the game is close, although difficult for black now.  But I thought that by blocking the other way I could kill the invasion.]
;B[cd];W[db];B[bc]C[
instead of B17 for black, how about d17 ?  note white can't answer at e18.]
;W[bb];B[dc];W[cb];B[be]C[Alex: Would it be better to play B16 instead?

no, play at e18 instead, since that's where black's territory is.]
;W[fb]C[Alex: Now is there any way to kill white?  I wondered about playing A18 here.]
;B[gb];W[ac];B[bd];W[fc]C[Alex: I probably should have resigned at this point.

black at G17.  keeps territory and makes white worry about whether corner is alive.]
;B[ab];W[hb]C[
black let white steal the territory.];B[eb];W[ec];B[ea];W[gc]
;B[ba];W[fa]C[Black resigns.])
