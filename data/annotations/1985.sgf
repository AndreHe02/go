C[Hello,

As I understand it, this game was played on IGS and probably with a small amount of time allotted. So I will not dive into deep variations. Rather, my comments will concentrate on strategy, shape and technique. A couple of yose remarks too, although these are particularly hard to calculate in fast games, because you finally lost the game in the endgame.

LB[gp:A]C[A play at 'a' is more usual. Your move creates a cutting point. See var.]

(;W[cn]LB[bn:A]C[White now creates a weakness, that is why usually he plays at A.]
;B[co]C[Good.];W[bo];B[dn];W[cm];B[cg]LB[el:A]C[White has only stones at the left side. The left side is thus the least interesting area to play for Black. Right now, investments at the top, bottom and right side will be much more productive. But, rather than playing elsewhere and occupy a big point,  a move at A, jumping ahead of White and establishing influence towards the center, looks more urgent.]
;W[di];B[eg];W[dc]LB[fd:A]C[This soft move by White gives the initiative to Black. A move at 'a' would be a better follow-up for the pincer.]
;B[fe]C[Good. White is surrounded.];W[gc];B[ed]C[This is a raw peep. It gives you bad shape. See next moves.]
;W[dd];B[ec]
(;W[ef]C[White should cut at the waist of the keima. See var.]
;B[ff];W[dg];B[dh];W[df];B[eh];W[ch];B[ci];W[bh];B[bi];W[bg]
;B[dj]C[This is a splendid result for Black. Your influence is now dominating the board, in exchange for 20 points in the corner.]
;W[fm];B[fj]LB[fg:B][ei:A]C[You must capture at A instead. The small extra profit you make does not make up for the aji left in the cut at B.]
;W[dm];B[id]LB[oc:D][pk:B][qo:C][ip:A]C[This is much too close to your strong group. There is a weak group to defend at the bottom. A looks like a good point. Building a moyo with B, and the shimaris at C and D, are big but defending the bottom is urgent.]
;W[hp]
(;B[go]C[The stones are not so important, it is the bottom which is important. See var.]
;W[eq];B[gp]C[Very good. The four stones don't matter.];W[ep]
;B[eo]C[Let them be captured and concentrate on the bottom.]
;W[fp]
(;B[gq]LB[hq:A]C[Better at A, to completely engulf the White stone]
;W[fo];B[ho];W[np];B[kp];W[po]
(;B[qp]LB[qo:A]C[Better tsuke at A. See var.];W[qo];B[nq]LB[nr:A]
C[Better at A. The attachment gives White the leverage to isolate the corner in sente.]

(;W[qk];B[mq]C[Good: though slow, the connection is big.];W[qf]
;B[oe];W[of];B[nf]C[Very good hane.];W[pe]
(;B[od]LB[pd:A]C[Better at A. See var.];W[pd];B[pc];W[ng];B[og]

C[This is small. White must now play A, leaving B and C as miai for security.]
;B[nh]C[Good.];W[qg]
(;B[gl]C[I suppose this is a ladder maker.  First, the ladder works already. See var 1.
Second, it is better to capture the stone immediately. See var 2.]
;W[mb];B[lb]LB[nb:A]C[If you had forced at A before, this would be atari.]
;W[lc];B[kb]LB[ma:A]C[Force at A first.];W[le]C[Not so good.]
;B[me];W[fg];B[gg];W[fh];B[ei];W[gh];B[hg];W[ii];B[mg]C[Good, esp. in a fast game. Blaxk is strong everywhere.]
;W[hh];B[ig];W[nj];B[lj]C[Very good point.];W[li];B[mi];W[mj]
;B[lk]C[Good.];W[ni];B[mh];W[il];B[gm]LB[fn:A]C[Also very strong: it links up your groups, cuts White, and there is a 12-point follow-up at A.]

;W[nm];B[jj];W[nl];B[pi]C[You correctly judged the 6 central stones out of danger. With this move, Black has a 20 points advantage.]
;W[qi];B[pj];W[qh];B[qj]C[This is dangerous, as the continuation shows. Perhaps you didn't see the cut.]

C[Should be at A.];W[oq];B[or];W[qq];B[op];W[rq];B[ro]C[In what follows I can't find a way to make life for Black along the right side. The marked move gave the lead to White. No comments for some time.]

C[Black dies in Gote.];W[fn]C[White makes another 12 points.]
;B[ri]LB[db:B][bl:D][fr:A][qr:C]C[In situations like these it is imperative to count. Because if you die in gote, White takes the big endgame points. if you can get your share of A,B,C or D, you can still win.]
