;B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[po];B[cd];W[ed]C[not sure what to do here its hard and I always seem to lose games like this.....

C: With B playng 3-line moves and W plaing 4-line moves only I would suggest B to play a territorial-oriented openening (see var.).]

(;B[gd]C[C: This is overreaction, too aggressive. On the top B doesn't have support for this fight and B doesn't have any big thickness around either (see var.).]

(;W[cc]C[C: This is a mistake by W (see var.).];B[bc];W[dc]
C[C: Now W is heavier comparing to the normal variation.];B[be]
;W[ef];B[dg]C[C: The right punishment for W's mistake, must help inside group first and also staying ahead of W.]
;W[ic]LB[gb:A]TR[cc][dc][ed][ef]C[C: The only move. W is no longer can K16 because W has a heavy group (W still has a connection under with A).]
;B[he]LB[gb:A]C[C: Correct responce. However W still has a connection at A and actually has to do it now (see var.).]

(;W[eg];B[dh]LB[gb:C][eg:A][dh:B]C[C: This A for B exchange is good for black. Now w can no longer play at C (see var.).]

(;W[ie]LB[dh:A]C[No idea how to respond

C: Black already got profit in this fight with A, and white is playing against his own group, which is not optimal (see var.)]

(;B[jc]C[C: What kind of move is that? You must help weak group first.]
;W[id];B[ib];W[hb];B[jb]C[C: B got 2 weak groups now, but W was forced to protect all his weakness. How generous from black.]

(;W[mc];B[ke]C[C: This shape doesn't feel right. Maybe l16 was better; when your group is heavy you cannot run fast, it won't become a light group anyway.]
;W[gc]TR[gd][he]C[no clue arg this game was hard....

C: B abandoned very imporant stones.]
(;B[qf];W[kf]C[C: This is touching a weak stone. When stone touches stone: 1) no tenuki; 2) extend when you are stronger (you don't need forcing moves and want to prevent the opponent to play forcing moves); 3) hane when you are weaker (you need forcing moves).]

(;B[le]C[C: This move is not correct (see var.).];W[lf];B[me]
;W[pf]C[C: It was a nice leaning attack. Now B is in trouble.]

(;B[fp]LB[fp:B][fq:A]C[C: Locally A is more reasonable than B here.]
;W[cj]LB[eg:A][dh:B]TR[ck]C[C: Not that bad for black because white made A to B exchange hurting his stones on the side. W should have played 2-space extension.]

(;B[eh]C[C: This move is big, but it doesn't have enough pressure on white (see var.).]
;W[bp]
(;B[cl]C[C: This is necessary];W[cq]
(;B[dq]TR[dp][fp]C[C: Slow play. Black is now overconcentrated (see var.).]
