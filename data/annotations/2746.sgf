C[Hi
I just played this game on KGS.
I play white (Mattias).
The player who is black got a rating of [14k?\]. So he can be stronger or weaker...

I know that I am a bit weak in the opening and a bit stronger at the middle game.
I want comments on the whole game. Good and bad moves. How should I do
some parts better? What is already good?
Thank you!
/Mattias

>> Hello

I go by the nick of Manueler in KGS, I must be around 6-5k. Let's proceed to the game.]
;B[qp]C[Mattias [14k\]: hi
begemot [14k?\]: hi];W[dd]C[Mattias> I am unsure about openings so I usually starts at 4-4.

Manueler>> I am also unsure about the opening, sometimes dan players are unsure about the opening, the opening is both a key part of go and one of the most difficult to master. As such there isn't an ''easy'' way out, playing at 4-4 just because it seems ''standard'' is not something to be advised. You must be aware of the positions that it can lead to, and have at least a general idea of what use you expect from that stone. I encouage you to try other positions as it will start giving you a feel for the uses of the different opening, checking a book of joseki, even if it's only perusing, will give you a vague idea of what kind of strategies you can take your opening to.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[pf];W[nd];B[qi];W[oq]TR[co][do]CR[pf][qi][qp]
[dq]C[Mattias> I felt that I must do something here. So I aimed to get the bottom.

Manueler>>This invasion is premature. You are just jumping in into black's sphere of influence which should lead to a disavantageous position. Had you atacked at the triagles, for example, you would develop naturally from there, then, if you think you are behind, you can plan an invasion.]
;B[mp]C[Mattias> I did not like this resonse...

Manueler>> Just as I said, this was premature.];W[lq]TR[oo]
CR[po]C[Mattias> Ok, maybe get something at the bottom. But I'm afraid of black get to much influence on the outside.

Manueler>> Triangle is the proper move, circle if you are in for the fighting. in this positionN3 can split you into two, or he can simply build influence by making you get low on the third line.]
;B[op];W[pq]C[Mattias> But I must live

Manueler>> it was sente, but not in the life or death sense,. but in the ''this position would be too good for black'' sense]
;B[pp];W[nq];B[np];W[iq]C[Manueler>> Still low];B[pl]TR[cf]
[df]C[Manueler>> This is over concentrated from the wall you just made, it's a lost move. Approaching at triangle is a much better ideea.]
;W[do]C[Manueler>> Good.];B[co];W[cn];B[cp];W[dn]C[Mattias> After this I was hoping to get D10 or D11]
;B[dj]TR[eq]C[Manueler>> This is an overplay, white's answer is at E3( triangle) totally surrounding black and leaving him with a not so big corner.]
;W[ch]C[Manueler>> See past advise.];B[nf];W[id]TR[fc][lc][fd]
[ld]CR[oi][oj][nl]C[Manueler>> This is a bit loose, a later approach at triangle would not be so strange. playng at the triangles to the left keeps your stones connected and besides, black's making you get territory along the 4th line, which is good fo r you. 
Black is thinking that he should make territory with his wall, and the point of strength is totally lost to him. Later, only if it becomes a worry, you can aim at reducing at circle, but only if you are certain you are e because it's going straight into black's claws.]
;B[eh];W[df];B[ff];W[fd];B[cc]TR[dd][fd][df]C[Mattias> Was afraid of this to happen...
Manueler>> This is hard to live. It's three stones to one. However, you do realise that by letting you take the outside blac's three stones are left astray in the middle, yiou should chase after them.

;W[ae];B[ca];W[fc]C[Manueler>> Niot necessary.];B[kc]TR[mc]
C[Mattias> I do not know how to respond to this.

Manueler>> At a glance, triangle looks like the key point, it takes away the posibility of an eye for black, you are strong to the left so no need to worry about J 16.]
;W[ld]C[Mattias> Maybe get 2 living groups...

No need wo worry it's black who is at a disavantadge here.]
;B[kd];W[ke];B[mc];W[md];B[nc];W[le]C[Manueler>> You lost the chance to play M17 or P17 in sente]
;B[pc];W[qc];B[oc];W[qd]C[Bad side to connect, see var.]
(;B[qf]C[Mattias> It does not look pretty. I feel that I need to get into the center.

Manueler>> You need to chase black's three lonely stones.];W[kh]
;B[mh]C[Mattias> Confused about what I can do here... So I start look at something else...

Just continue to isolate blacks lonely trio of stones. Or play E3 to limit black's corner and get territory on the lower side.]
;W[cj]C[Mattias> Try to connect.

Manueler>> Triangle was the right idea, attaching to a weak stone is not, you have just told black what you are after and besides he can now get some shape.]

;B[gi];W[ii];B[hg];W[jc]C[Mattias> I regretted this move after I placed it.

Manueler>> It's ok, see var.];B[jd]
(;W[ic]C[Manueler>> The mistake was this move, see variation.]
;B[je];W[kf];B[jf]C[Manueler: at least you should push at M17]

(;B[gg];W[qq];B[od]TR[pb][re]C[Mattias> I gave up theese 3 stones early. So, this was no surprise. Maybe it was stupid... many points?

Manueler You could have lived at triangle. Or connected, it's worth about 30 or 40 points.]

Manueler>> 4 stones are bigger than 3, especially in the corner. now black can kill you.]
;B[rq];W[rr]
(;B[rp];W[ps]C[Mattias> Can I be killed?

I don't see a way to kill it, but it DOES seem weak, maybe a stronger player could kill it.]

Mattias> The score ended victory for black with 4.5 ponts including the komi of 6.5 points.

Manueler>> Keep these thing in mind for you next games: 

Keep your stones connected.

Invasion must be made at the right time, if donde prematurely they lead to bad results. 

Chase Your opponent;s weak group, chase them into your strength.

And walls are not made to make territory, but to gain influence.

Good Luck!
