C[Dear reviewer,
I played this game as white and lost with 4,5 points.
Please help me to find some mistakes I made.
I made some questions in the course of the game. Please would you so kind to answer:
Thank you in advance
Thomas

Hello Thomas,

I'm snip on KGS, probably about 2 kyu, so I can't say for sure what is best.  Have to be a pro for that.  But you did make some mistakes in the game that violate basic principles and they got you in trouble -- particularly mistakes in direction.  In one case you are driving your opponent away from your thickness toward your potential points, and in another you again push him IN to your territory rather than away from it when there was no real hope of killing him.  Ultimately, you made some good endgame plays and nearly caught back up.  Hope the review helps.  If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.]

(;W[jd]LB[kc:A]TR[dj]C[this move feels funny.  It is on the 4th line, looking for influence rather than taking territory, and also feels too close to B.  A is more normal I think and works toward some profit.  With black's marked stone, it seems difficult to use the influence.]
;B[pn];W[np];B[jq]LB[hq:A][lq:B]C[Here you have a choice which of your groups to help.  As a rule, help the weaker group.  Clearly there are more black stones on the left side of the board, so the left side must be weaker.  So a move at A would be better than the game move at B.]

I think you move is best.];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq]LB[ch:B][cl:A]C[So how white has a huge wall, and black has lots of stones in front of it.  The challenge is how to get some value out of the wall.  What can be attacked?  The top left corner is totally strong, but there are two holes in the sides.  An invasion seems necessary.]

(;W[cj]C[I don't like this move.  You are touching a relatively weak stone.  You want to use your wall to attack, and a contact play will settle black.]

(;B[qp]C[black is at least as strong as white on the left, and your wall has lost most of it's value.]

TR[dg][ci][di][cj]C[marked group is still weak, so this attack can't go well.]
;B[cm]C[Just made black stronger.];W[fh]C[good];B[fl]
(;W[hm]C[Wrong direction.  You are trying to make a few tiny points next to your wall.  "don't use thickness to make points"  You want to push your opponent toward your thickness.]
;B[hk];W[hh];B[pc];W[ne];B[kd]
(;W[ke]C[I feel I dealt not well with this invasion.
In the course of the game I got a weak group and not  black who invaded.
How could I improve?


This is a big mistake in direction too.  First of all, your points are on the top, not in the middle right.  So hane on the other side.  Your move says "I'm going to kill you" which isn't reasonable with that much open space on the top.  And if you fail, all your points are gone.]
