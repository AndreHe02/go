C[>Hi, Thanks for the review!

>I am black


Hi, I will do my best to be clear as crystal in my explanations. The sad point is, you don't point out so much what really disturbed you, or where you feel your own weaknesses are.
If you need more details about the game, you can contact me again, per mail or on kgs (ID mianreg).
Let's go !];B[pp];W[dc];B[pd]C[>I have only been playing Hoshi since I started playing again. I want to be comfortable with that before I go on to 3-4 point.

Your call. Nirensei (2 hoshi) is also very common, and a good way to claim influence anyway. Hence, this should be your aim : moyo-oriented game and possibly offense and aggressiveness.]
;W[dp];B[fq]C[>I chose to attack his hoshi instead of attacking D17 because I wanted to gain influence on the bottom side of the board.

It's OK. Options are still wide open, and you hardly break any rule. By the way, rules are to be broken if you are eager to assume it ^_^ . F3 is fine.]
;W[qj]C[Weird. C6, D6, or a high pincer here. But tenuki ?..]
;B[qm]C[A good way to make F3 shine.];W[nq]
(;B[lq];W[no];B[lo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm]
(;B[ql]C[A calm move, but a good one, as long as B considers cutting apart the 2 weak groups. The hane Q8 has to be considered, but it would be a wild strategy (see variants).
For now, W is not connected yet, and B gets solid territory.]
;W[po]
(;B[qp]C[I guess you didn't like R5 (then P4 Q3 or R4). Make it simple, though, whenever possible. R5 is clean and solid, and doesn't help W that much in any way. See variant.

For now, this should be a very rigid rule : "Play simple and solid moves". :o)]
;W[qo];B[ro]TR[rp][rn]C[Because now, B has 2 extra cuts. Nothing threating... yet ! But who knows...]
;W[op]
(;B[pr]LB[jc:6][cf:5][fn:4][qg:3][dn:2][ok:1]C[>Wasn't sure what to do here.

This is little. A few points to protect, and a lost sente. I would consider the numbered moves instead, in order of relevance (according to my perception) :


Let's make it clear, absolute priorities are :
1/ YOUR OWN weak groups.
2/ YOUR OPPONENT'S weak groups.
3/ Big moves.
In this order. Aaaalways. So, if you are not sure where to play, 3 questions to consider :
- Do I have weak groups ? Here, I would say B is fine everywhere, even F3 wouldn't mind if W played a pincer.
- Does my opponent have some ? Obviously. You can chase Q6 and/or R10, but you have to cut. So, split comments :


1- THE cut to play at once. See variant.
2- and 3- are both sente : 2, because an extra move would enclose and kill the corner. 3, because, if W doesn't connect, he has 2 weak groups now, for R10 has no base then.
4, 5 and 6- Big moves.

There you are. Too soon for Q2.];W[qg];B[cq]C[>Maybe I should have tried to kill the Q5 Group first?

Killed, not necessarily. Chased. You may consider it : usually, and above all in an open board, it is much easier to live than to kill. Mainly, attacking is not trying to kill, it is threatening to do it. I mean, odds are very good Q5 will leave. But attacking it gives you profit in a way or another. Take care : it is very important to notice it :
"Don't try to kill unless you see exactly how to kill".

But chasing is fine. P9 is a nice start, laking Q5 flee and then B has support stones to put pressure on R10, is outside easily, makes a wall to cover a nice territory on the lower side, etc. . Thanks to Q5's weakness, not thanks to its death.
Time will help :o) . You will catch it soon enough.];W[dq];B[cp]

(;W[co]C[Ouch ! Mistake. I'll show you the well-known joseki, and what you missed to punish this overplay...]

(;B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[fo];B[hq]C[>I wasn't sure here, I didn't want to reach further to J3 or H4 and risk losig F3. I'm thinking that H4 would have been better.

Indeed. H4 is more active, I . J3 is solid but smaller than H4. By the way, H3 arguably better than J3, because is is a valid extension from M3-M5, and it covers any weakness caused by the vicinity of F5.
So H4 seems better, but locally, H3 is good.];W[nc];B[dr]C[>I think I should have responded to O17, I almost lose this group later and white gains alot of influence here which wins him the game.

You should have, yes. Already 2 stones vs 1, so don't come too late.]

(;W[ne]C[Or 3-3. Theoretically, B lost the whole corner. 3 stones vs 1 !]
;B[oc]
(;W[nb];B[ob];W[id];B[ce]TR[dc][id]C[Notice : Q16 still potentially dead.

There, facing a framework for a living groups, you may try approaching higher or further : that is, C14, D15 or D14. But good reflex. A shimari (W C15 or C14) facing J16 would be too big to deal with.
Problem is : a close approach is easy to pincer, especially with J16 already settled.]
;W[cg];B[ee]C[>At this point I'm struggling to break up this area that white is taking for himself. I can't let him take it without a fight!]

(;B[ah]C[>I was thinking I could connect with this. Maybe B12 would work better?

no, but B13 does. F12 is too loose, E12 would have cut. Thing is, connecting is a desperate move : you are behind, and you will lose the sente.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[ag];B[ai];W[ei]C[Too many weaknesses : now you can connect.]

(;B[cl]C[This is a good threat before connecting, because the C6 group is not expandable and tenuki would be... distasteful !]

Please play one move back and look for it. When you think you found it, then only you may play further ;o)]
;W[ml]TR[lk]C[N8 is good. For B, M9 was the biggest move on the board. Now it's gone...
Please compare : the game as it is, and B M9 instead of H4. You will see a major difference on the board : it sets a totally different direction for the flow of stones !]
;B[ll];W[lk]
(;B[kl];W[kk];B[jl]C[>I build a wall for him.
