C[DollyDS [4k\]: hi, gl
Good day :)
My name is Dolly Da Sheep and I would be grateful to see your comments concering this game. Thanks in advance. I'm gonna add some notes in the critical (from my point of view) moments of the gameflow.]
;B[pc];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[eq];W[do];B[hp]
(;W[qo]
(;B[dl];W[dq];B[ep];W[eo]C[I doubt if E5 is correct here. Probably O3-N3 would be better.

Kilroy: E5 is fine, black F5 will only hurt D8. Also a pincer in the lower right is probably bad, you will come underattack, and white would have little potental on the bottom.]
;B[cf]
(;W[ce];B[df];W[de];B[ef]C[My opponent happy to build a terrytory on the 4th line... me baka *_*

Kilroy: this joseki is very good because black has D8

Here it might be best to move to another point on the board]

(;W[dk]C[I don't like D9. Yes, even I don't :). Even D10 looks much better.]
;B[el];W[cl];B[cm];W[bl];B[cn];W[bo];B[bn];W[co];B[ek];W[dm]
;B[dn];W[op]C[At the moment I see the way to save B8 group. But my opponent have noticed it earlier...]
;B[oq];W[np];B[mq];W[pj];B[dj]C[your exchanges after D9 only made black stronger, while you've gained nothing, i wouldnt' try to save these stones]

(;W[bh];B[be]C[I should answer the threat. There's no doubt. The corner has a nice potential even besides the terrutory itself.]

;W[jc];B[fd];W[gc];B[fc];W[qe]C[Wrong direction, I guess. I should have played from my weaker side, around N17 or so.

the top left corner was bigger than living on the side];B[lc]
C[playing black, I would prefer tR16 and followings instead of the actual game pattern. For white, If I would be smarter, I'd make a P15 jump.]

C[N4 is a vital point for both groups, but I decided to play tennuki since I dedn't expect much from such a thin moyo.]
;W[gn];B[mn];W[om];B[in];W[hm];B[im];W[hk];B[qh]C[In the end, R10 looks better. It would be still possible to continue an attack and to avoid harming my own potential terrytory.]

Well, I see some of the mistakes myself, but, of course, not all of them. Well, thanks again. I hope to learn from your advises.


It is important to come out of the fuseki with a strong base to build everything off. You fought well, but should be more worried about your fight being a gain. loseing the top left was not worth the left side. Sorry this took so long to get to you, but the end of the semester is stressful.]
