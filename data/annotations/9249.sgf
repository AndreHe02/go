;B[qc];W[dp]C[Wrenn: The 3-3 suggests that you are planning to win the game by territory, and you also need to prepare for White getting a large moyo that you must invade.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[dd];B[qp];W[op]LB[nd:B][od:A]
C[Wrenn: Because Black is low on both the top right and the bottom left, White should feel no pressing need to invade here now. Approaching R17 from the top seems like a perfectly fine plan.]
;B[oq];W[nq]C[I thought that white should have played q4 instead, because black's position is generally low

Wrenn: I agree. This is setting him up to get a small group on the bottom without a big future, and that will interfere with his two 4-4 stones' ability to make a large moyo.]
;B[pq]LB[nd:C][nm:B][np:A]C[Wrenn: Here White connected at A, creating a heavy group. B would create a lighter more influence-oriented shape. The tenuki at C is fine too, since cutting at A is gote, and still does not remove all the aji.]

(;B[io];W[gq]LB[fp:B][gp:C][hq:E][fr:A][gr:D]C[Wrenn: This is a rather unusual move. The normal technique for White would be to peep at h4 first, to see how Black replies. This move has a very straight forward refutation as well: H3]

(;B[in];W[fo]LB[eo:A]C[Wrenn: Now Black has lost most of the aji, and he still has a weak group.]

(;B[kp];W[lp];B[lq];W[mq]
(;B[kr];W[ln]LB[ci:C][il:A][eo:B]C[Wrenn: At this point, your two stones are just two stones, they are simply cutting two strongish groups.]

(;B[il];W[ep]C[Wrenn: Now there is nothing.];B[cr]LB[ci:A]C[Not sure if this was necessary. It seemed quite big because white has sente moves later at c2 and m2. Maybe it would be better to tenuki with black Q10. I didn't like black K17 or K16 because it just seems  awkward in relation to R17.

Wrenn: this is very small. Black will get either n2 or c3, depending on what White plays. Now is the time to wedge between White's left side, making the moyo and thickness less useful.]
;W[jm];B[im]
(;W[pm];B[qm];W[po]LB[pl:B][qo:A]C[Wrenn: Unless you have a darn good reason, you should hane here.]

(;B[qo];W[pl];B[jl];W[ql]TR[jl]C[Wrenn: if you consider the effect of these two turns: White has sealed Black in on the right side, While Black is trying to attack a group that is connected and does not need to respond.]
;B[qf];W[qh];B[fc];W[df];B[jd]LB[id:A]C[Wrenn: Here White seems to have been very kind. Given the wide distance between K16 and the 3-3 (not really interacting very much), you can consider playing J16, which has a better connection to F17. There is a general idea in go: if you can be 100% happy on one side, 100% happy on another side, or 50% happy on each, try to pick a side. If you can be 100% happy on each, play in between. Here the ample invasion space on both sides makes both sides sad.]
;W[lc]LB[hc:A][jc:B][oc:C][le:D]C[Wrenn: Notice how much room this White stone has to move around in, even with Black at K16. White would be significantly worse off if Black K16 was in fact at J16, because there would be less thinness in Black's position.]
;B[kc]C[I don't like my move at L17. I think it might be better to just seal white in with L15 or M15

Wrenn: L17 forces White to m16, and it forces Black to follow up again with a move like k14. This is not bad, but I think it is clear how difficult launching a satisfying attack on the White stone is. This has a lot to do with the 3-3 corner veing almost unable to exert center-pressure. If you do not want to take gote with the k14 jump after the extension, the irno pillar at k17 is more effective. Trying to cap the stone seems a little too optimisitc, since White will have no trouble getting life, and Black is going to be hard pressed to get enough influence in the middle to cancel out the weakness of the wall and the strength of White's groups.]
;W[ld]
(;B[nc]C[Here I didn't play K14 because i didn't want white to settle easily, but maybe it is a mistake?

Wrenn: White running to the center makes his invasion successful since he can no longer be attacked, and this pincer only gets you 6 more points? meanwhile leaving the j17 weakness could help White considerably in the future.]
;W[je];B[id];W[kd];B[kb];W[ie];B[hd];W[pd];B[qd]
(;W[pe];B[ne]C[This attack seemed correct, or else white connects up too easily. But I think white didn't respond in the right way.

Wrenn: Black is still very thin all over here, so this is a good attitude, but it will be tough to pull off.]

;B[om];W[ms];B[jn];W[gs];B[fs]C[Comments on black's weaknesses are greatly appreciated. Thank you anonymous reviewer!

Wrenn:
1) You need to look at the aji that positions have, and find ways of using to your advantage. You very often play forcing moves that help your opponent and do not really help you very much. This happened on the bottom left and the top left. Failing to see the aji also is what let White connect in the top middle.

2) You can feel more loose when things go badly and you end up with a bad position. When White got a good position on the bottom, you could have changed the shape of the game by getting a position on th left, but you stubbornly tried to hold on to your own two stones. It turned out working well, but only because you had a careless opponent.

3) True for everyone, but work on reading and life and death. The bottom right is the type of place where you want to nail the reading, before committing to any defending move.]
