White: Saurus (7 kyu KGS)
Black: Stefan (Probably around 11 kyu KGS)

4 stones handicap and additional -5.0 negative komi

Result: B+11

This is a 4 stone handicap game which was played on DGS over a period of about two weeks.

Saurus: The review we are requesting is for both black and white. Both sides have fully commentated our moves, so as to give the reviewer an indication of our line of thinking during the game.

As white, I won most of the fights locally, but still lost the game. This leads me to think that there were strategic errors in my play. My main hope from this review is that my strategic errors are be pointed out, and that I will better be able to identify the correct points to invade.

Black is hoping to determine the best way to handle these invasions, and also would like to know where he can improve in his way of thinking in handicap and fighting games, as shown in his comments on the moves.]
PL[W];W[qf]C[Saurus: Onegaishimasu!];B[nc]C[Stefan: Same to you!]
;W[qn]C[Saurus: My play at r6 here gives me three possibilities:
X: Since you're mainly interested in invasions and I'm not particularly good at the opening anyhow, I won't comment too much here.

1. If black replies at b-o3 or b-o4, then I will play w-q10, making a base on the right.
X: Quite standard.

2. If black replies reply with b-q10, then I play the double kakari at w-03, and protecting the corner will mean that white will get influence along the bottom.

3. If black tries punish my overplay of leaving r14 alone, this will lead to fierce fighting and many complications, which is also good for white in a handicap game.
X: This isn't an overplay it's quite straight-forward handicap-play. Black can of course tenuki anyway, but there isn't really anything else that is more urgent, if black really wanted to, could pincer the other side, but still, the interesting part of the board is right now the right side.]

(;B[nq]C[Stefan: I think it's ok to let you the right hand side. When you build a base there I will probably play on the left hand side and wait for your attack.

X: So far quite normal.];W[pj];B[dj]C[Stefan: I do the sanrensei and await your invasions.

X: I think this is pretty good. White cannot avoid black creating a double-wing formation.]
;W[cn]C[Saurus: Normally I would approach with w-f3, but since this is handicap, I have to choose the more aggressive option.

X: Nothing wrong here. In fact, since the right bottom corner is so well settled, you have more chances of instigating weaknesses somehow.]
;B[co]C[Stefan: As I've already got the d10 stone, I play the diagonal attachment.

X: Good thinking.];W[dn];B[fp];W[dl]C[Saurus: This move follows the proverb:

"If there is a choice between running or living small, it is always better to run."

Therefore, I think that w-d8 is better than w-c8, because it guarantees that I will be able to run should the need arise.]
;B[fm]TR[dj]LB[fn:a]C[Stefan: I want to restrict your way out and think that my f4 stone should support this. If you squeeze between f4 and f7 I've got the great (IMO ^^) f9 left.

X: The marked black is still relatively weak, whereas black's lower side is quite strong and stable. Therefore I would rather push in the other direction as black.
 Also, the placement of 12 is somewhat loose, a bit too thin. It presents too many cutting points for white to make things complicated, which is generally how stronger players try to win handicap games.]

(;W[ck]C[Saurus: I need to first settle my group before trying anything.

X: True, but I wouldn't use a kosumi in this case. As black responded (C10), the touch to a kosumi is a very strong and stable pillar for black, and makes white uncomfortably pressed. I would rather attach, or just keep running. I think as white, I would rather attach on top of E10 (see variation), then cut through black's lower side with F6.]
;B[cj];W[fn]C[Saurus: Now I can play w-f6 since the reply b-e7 is no longer a problem. ie. After w-f6, then if black plays b-e7, then w-e6, b-d7, w-c7. Obviously, w-f6 was impossible before w-c9.]

(;B[em]C[Stefan: I think e7 is still big and sente and would be too nice shape for you.]
;W[bj]C[Saurus: After b-e7 now, life is still miai, since I can probably still live underneath or run.

X: I don't understand what you mean with "lifei s miai"....
In anycase, I think right now it is more important for white to get out and not be closed in, white can't make much territory like this. White can get out while threatening the two black stones.]
;B[dk]C[Stefan: I prefer to let white live small than to run, and therefore play this which I think is sente, too, as bC8 would now be very bad for white, and build some outside influence by the way.

Unsure though if letting the "backdoor exit" at b11 open is that good. I'll have to patch that sooner or later.

X: You don't havw a moyo on the other side yet, so this isn't the only way to go, but mostly just depends on your style of play.]

(;W[bl];B[og];W[fd]C[Saurus:

r14 should be able to live (miai), so I tenuki.

X: Very gutsy, both white and black. Of course white needs to make some bold moves, black should play more thickly though. Again it is too easy to cut off the lone black stone, too thin.]
;B[df];W[ic]C[Saurus: Leaving the corner to increase future options in that corner....

X: I don't really understand your point here. Black can:]
(;B[jp]C[Stefan: I think it's bigger to play here than at l17.]
;W[hq]C[Saurus: I think I must invade immediately.];B[gq]
(;W[hr]C[X: Very heavy. Either extend upwards, or sacrifice immediately.]

(;B[jr];W[cq]C[Saurus: The h2 group is not worth protecting (maybe 10 points, and saving it is gote.)

I think it is much better to use it's aji to try and make a corner invasion succeed.

X:Doesn't seem very logical to "have to invade" and then just sacrifice the two stones so quickly.
Your sacrificed 2 stones let black solidify a lot of territory and become quite strong, and the aji you're using only give very little territory.]
;B[cp]C[Stefan: Hmmm... now defend from which side?

I thought about a possible catastrophe via bD4 wC4 bD5 wD5 and thus chose the other side.

X: Uhm, bD4 is hoshi, and black already has that....You mean D3 I presume.
The empty triangle you played is actually quite normal in this situation.]
;W[bp];B[bo]C[Stefan: Cut you off from your side group.

X: Correct];W[dr]C[Saurus: Difficult to read, but this way gives me the most options, I think.]
;B[dq]C[Stefan: I think it can't be bad to  press you further down. If I miss the kill you'll live only small.]
;W[br];B[er]C[Stefan: Don't want you to connect out here. I think I might still kill you, too, so you can't tenuki.]
;W[ap]C[Saurus: Here, w-a4 is better than w-d1, since now life is miai. (w-a5 or w-d1)]
;B[cs]
(;W[ao];B[bn]C[Stefan: So I run into your position...

X: Absolutely correct.];W[an];B[bm];W[am];B[cm]C[X: I don't understand this exchange.]
;W[ch]C[X: Very big.];B[nj]C[Stefan: What to do now? With the left side basically settled (and in my favor, I think) I go for a bigger moyo.

X: Left side was indeed settled in your favour. I would settle the two black stones in the upper right orner though. Perhaps the same wasy as I showed when the position arised.
Otherwise, absolutely correct, you have a very thick wall on the lower left, so make moyo on the other side.]
;W[lc]C[Saurus: Handicap means there is no way I can afford to solidify or share territory. I must play aggressively.

X: This move is very solid, it says "Take territory and make stability". and against a keima shimari, there isn't that much to attack anyhow, especially since with 1 move black can connect to the center.]
;B[qh]C[Stefan: I go for your side.

X: Very aggressive, but that is very feasible under the present situation.]
;W[qi];B[ph];W[qp]C[Saurus: Here, I still have a few sente moves to increase my territory before dealing with r14.]

(;B[qq];W[ri]C[Saurus: Still sente...];B[rh];W[nk]C[Saurus: I think that allowing black to enclose the L7 area is bigger than the corner.

X: Indeed.];B[om]C[Stefan: This aims at r8 and if you react there, I can go to m7 or so.]

(;W[oj]C[Saurus: I need a way into the center.];B[ni]C[Stefan: I think o11 would have been too good for you.]
;W[mk]C[Saurus: I get access to the center.

X: You're not using P7 the way you had planned. Put up the pressure first.]
;B[lm]C[Stefan: Block black off the right bottom.];W[nm];B[nn]
;W[mh]
(;B[nh]C[Stefan: Need to stay connected.

X: I don't see how white could cut here. As long as your moves are also another way out.]
;W[mg]C[Saurus: Using the aji of r14.];B[ne];W[nf]C[Saurus: Building a white wall through of the threat of connecting at p14.]
;B[of];W[qc]C[Saurus: R14 has now served its purpose...];B[qd]
;W[ob]C[Saurus: Don't think I'll be able to live here...];B[pc]
;W[nb];B[pb];W[mc];B[ql]C[Stefan: I think I can let go of o17 and o15 and take the opportunity to split up black's right bottom group.

X: Yes, much bigger. O17 is just a stone, it's not necessary to make life or to attack.]
;W[pm]C[Saurus: Fighting...];B[ol];W[pl];B[ok]C[Stefan: Split.]
;W[mm]C[Saurus: Bamboo joint - always very strong.]
(;B[mn]C[Stefan: I rather give up the p9 group... bad reading.

X: Better to save P9 group, leave white very weak.];W[on]C[Saurus: I guess this is forced.]
;B[oo]C[Stefan: take the profit...];W[pn];B[ml]C[X: Gote move. Not good.]

;B[cf]C[Stefan: Step back and maybe get something in the corner instead. But I need to be careful with my d10 group.]
;W[cc]C[Saurus: I guess this is more of a probe than an attack.

X: It's not a probe if it's a guess ^__~.]
(;B[dc];W[cd]C[Saurus: I think the other way guaranteed life for black. This way is bigger, but risky.]
;B[ce];W[db];B[eb];W[cb]
(;B[ec]C[Stefan: Guess I have to reinforce here...]
(;W[fb];B[da];W[ab];B[bd]C[Stefan: I'm trying to read this out w/o Eidogo, so I think one line goes like this: wB17 bB19 wB15 bB14 wA16 bC19 which would be dead, I think.

But certainly I miss something ^^]
(;W[ca]C[Saurus: This is the reason I played f18 first - now c19 is sente...

X: not good reasoning. Playing a move in gote so that your next move is sente is still gote.]

(;B[bh]C[Stefan: So now it's time to worry about my own eyeshape ^^

;W[bi]C[Saurus: I glad for sente...];B[ci]
(;W[fj]C[X: Or white could cut and keep the group under pressure. It's a very big group. Howver, 121 isn't bad, since white has a a wall on the right as well, it works well together.]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[el]
(;W[le]C[X: ?];B[fi];W[ei]C[Saurus: I have to kill your center group. Else I lose...   :)]
;B[ej];W[gi]C[Saurus:  As far as I can see, this is the only way I still have any chance in this game...    :)]
;B[fh]C[Stefan: I think I have good chances to survive, as I still might link up to the right, the top left dead group has some aji left and this ladder starts favorable.

X: I think you're being very optimistic ^__^. Since you still have an advantage in territory, play things safe and sound.]
;W[fg];B[gh];W[hh];B[gg];W[hj]C[Saurus: No point attacking with a weak group, so I strengthen first...

X: Absolutely];B[gf]C[Stefan: So I get sente...];W[fe]C[Saurus: I think this connection is better than e14, because e14 still leaves the possibility of f16 being cut. It's also better than w-f14, since that allows b-g15 in sente.

X: Bamboo knot is almost always good.];B[lk];W[mj]C[Saurus: b-m9 hurts a lot. Capturing the p8 group now gives black huge possibilities with sente. Running causes problems for white too, and black might even connect to j13, but chasing white out also leaves bad aji for black at m6 and p5 area, so I do get some compensation.

Sadly, I don't think it will be enough...];B[lj]C[Stefan: Here I choose to press from this side instead of n11 as I want some extra thickness to attack your center group.

X: Absolutely.];W[mi];B[ih];W[hg]C[Saurus: W-j11 loses after b-k11, so I try something else...]
;B[hf];W[hi]C[Saurus: By this exchange, I have sacrificed my eyespace, but now j14 and a play in the L11 area are miai.]
;B[if]C[Stefan: I think white now faces an uphill battle, as I should have enough liberties and white is surrounded.]
;W[jj];B[ki]C[Stefan: Since I'll be going for the kill, I'll have to cut you off from the upper side.]
;W[ji]C[Saurus: Forced...];B[kh];W[jh];B[kg];W[jg];B[jf];W[kf]

(;B[gk];W[hk];B[fl];W[gj];B[hl];W[jl];B[jm];W[il]

;B[cr]C[Stefan: So I have to make the most of what I've got.

X: Yup. Actually could have done that before already, since you've got a decent lead. Didn't need to risk a fight that gives white the chance of getting back in the game.]
;W[bq];B[qo]C[X: Very big. Bigger than C2.];W[kj]C[Saurus: Hoping to increase the bad aji of the weaknesses around the n6 group...]
;B[li];W[im];B[in];W[kq]C[Saurus: This is to create something to run to and increase liberties for a possible cut at m6.

I think it allows me to play this w-q5 next.];B[jq];W[po]C[Saurus: It's hard to read, but I suspect that if black captures r5 now, I might be able to cut off the m9 group with something like o5, m6, m5 and L7 (Maybe o5 can also be used). Before L3, I was short by one liberty, but now I have something to run to.]

White: 68 territories + 29 prisoners + -5.0 komi = 92
Black: 88 territories + 15 prisoners = 103
Result: B+11

X: For white
   Imo your invasions are often rather uncertain. You see where you need to invade, but instead of invading with certainty, you often made an invasion, then instead of living with the invasion, you used it for aji. As a result, your invasions often made black stronger. Particularly, it often helped black get stronger in the direction black wanted.
  I think you should check for moyos, walls and influence a little more, and try to make your invasions coherent to these factors.

For black
   Not much to say, mostly good. In the beginning a few moves were a bit thin, which is not so wise in handicap games. Choose when to be solid and when to be fast. (If you're stronger, you can play more fast, if you're weak/white is strong, then you need to be more solid, as a general rule).

For both:
At your levels, you could start to learn to count territories. This is something I still have a bit of trouble with because I never really bothered to do it and never got much excercise. This is however a very important factor. If you're losing, then you'll need to risk more. If you can tell that you'll win by just playing solid, then it is of course better not to risk, since it doesn't matter by how much you win, even 0.5 point is enough. In this game this is particularly valid for black. In the end you won anyway even though you lost a very big fight towards the end. Would have been even easier if you had played solidly towards the end!

Cheers,

if you have questions, or noticed that something I wrote doesn't make much sense (I make mistakes too >__<), feel free to let me know.

Of course, black has two moves now that he wants to cover asap, B11 and strengthen the stone at P13 (and thus the group in the corner, which is now no longer so strong as before, although still fine.)]

I would prefer A or B, or even C and D. (Although I think A and B are better. either way, white can settle one of his stones, so better to let him get stronger on the side black is also strong on.)]
