C[Review focuses on the first 100 moves of the game. Later stages of the game will improve if the earlier advice is considered and if positions are read out more carefully.

There are a few recurring issues. First, white is playing extremely heavily. Most of white's moves are connected to his other stones, or very few spaces away. White should play lighter, securing territory and influence, making life when pressed and extending from alive and secure groups.

Second, white needs to be aware of good shape. Empty triangles abound in his play. Part of this can be resolved by addressing the first issue above: good shapes are no heavier than they need to be, bad shapes are overly dense and connected.

Third, white needs to be aware of strategic objectives in the game. There are several instances where he should extend or tenuki. There are other instances where his groups, territory, or influence are under threat and he ignores the threat. Again, this seems to tie back to the reluctance to play far away from his existing stones.]

(;W[pf]C[Remember the proverb: beginners play atari. Extension in this case is better.

Black's invasion aims to live in the corner. The cut at Q15 deviates from this line of play, so white should aim to kill black's stones. The atari leaves a weakness which prevents white from doing this.]
