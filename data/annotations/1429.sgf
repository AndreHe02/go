C[kypros is ranked 23k* on igs...I (cycle) have just recently begun trying to play seriously, reading books, etc. I played a few games with a friend of mine, and he suggested that I start my rank out around 25k, and play people in the 20k-30k range. Any and all comments on my play are greatly appreciated!
I've placed a couple of specific questions I have throughout.  hi i will review your game as good as i can. note as you are about the same rank i will comment on both players playing and offer some moves for both of you.]
;B[qp];W[dq];B[pf]LB[oc:E][pc:B][qc:D][pd:A][qd:C][qe:F]C[i would stay in the following opening points A,B,C,D,E,F THE 6X4 POINT IS NOT A COMMON OPENING POINT. it does not give you a start in the corner with the one move]
;W[dc];B[oc]LB[qc:A][qd:B]C[note white can still take the corner from you with A or B]
;W[oq];B[pq];W[op];B[oo];W[lp];B[jd];W[ce];B[dj];W[gd];B[hc]
LB[gc:A]C[good move for black white should play A as soon as there are not better moves]
;W[ch]LB[cj:B][co:A][ci:C]C[black needs to add a stone to D10 A  would help or B or C]
;B[lo]C[I'm thinking, "keep his group low, connect with my group on the lower right and have influence toward the center." a) Is this the most effective way to implement this strategy? and, b) is this the right general strategy at this point (e.g., would it be better to try to divide his group on the bottom say at H3,H4)?]
;W[ko];B[pk]LB[ln:A]C[A is a good play here for black];W[dl]
C[now white has attacked your stone at D10];B[kn];W[mo];B[ln]
;W[jo];B[nn];W[no];B[on];W[pp];B[po];W[qq]C[lets look at a way you can use the stone at Q3 you have lost it so .. look at the moves]

(;B[pr]C[Q3 is now lost, correct? I try to save it, but it hindsight, maybe R2 would have been the better move here, to salvage some territory in the corner. see the variation for these moves]
;W[or];B[qr];W[rq]LB[rr:A]C[here black can play and keep some of the corner.]

(;B[rp];W[rr];B[jn];W[io];B[in];W[ho];B[gn]C[After he was happy to extend this far, i didn't feel safe continuing, perhaps trying to cut D3 from D8. Should I have just continued extending left, or is there a serious disadvantage for me? (This move evidently caused me trouble.) for every play you made he got 4 points as you do not have any stones under them to reduce his points. you however are making a good wall if you can keep white out of the center]

;W[hl];B[im];W[ek];B[ik];W[fk];B[hk];W[go];B[fj];W[ej];B[fi]
;W[ei];B[lk]LB[il:A]C[Trying to assure that J10-F11, M5-H7, and the left hand side can eventually connect. would this move be better used to try to seal white in the upper-left? (or elsewhere?)  A would force white to connect and you are connected then also]
;W[hf];B[ig];W[hg];B[ih];W[hh];B[gj]C[Right now, I'm thinking that I should be able to defend the entire upper right; say, everything right of L and above 8. Is this unreasonable, given this board position? I ended up not being able to do it, of course, but I think that is largely due to not knowing the best way to defend. From here on out, I would especially appreciate comments on how to better defend against the various white attacks. as i mentioned at the start the upper right corner is open for attack  an move by black at R17 would make it real area]
;W[je];B[if];W[ie];B[ke];W[jf]LB[kg:A][lg:B]C[forcing the ladder will not work as white is not in ATARI   B would slow the advance]
;B[jg];W[kf];B[lf];W[kg];B[lg];W[kh]C[Should I be more concerned with connecting the group about J13, or preventing white penetration? I end up waiting one move too long to play J11, thus losing that group.]
;B[lh];W[ii];B[li];W[fh];B[gc];W[fc];B[fb];W[ec];B[ji];W[jh]
;B[ki]C[a good "sacrifice" (they were dead anyway) to attempt to seal off penetration?yes if stones are lost use them]

(;B[dk];W[dh];B[di]C[I thought maybe there was enough room to form eyes in here, with the help of the threat on F9-E11. a) Is there? and b) if so, what should I do differently? (I end up almost getting it)]

C[Final score: W173.5, B93 (0.5 handicap for white) I didn't feel like I lost that badly, but the play at the top probably made up a significant portion of that swing. yes over all you did a good job connecting. your stones. if you can get some books on life and death you will find it will help you in the lacal fighting.
if you have any more questions you can look for me on KGS or E-Mail me to set up a teaching game on KGS  i use humfeeder  on KGS or the ZONE]
