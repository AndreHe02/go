TM[600]RE[W+Time]US[Brought to you by No Name Go Server]KM[5.5];B[qc]C[dada: The game  developed fine. After an  invasion in the lower right, I nearly got killed.
I guess I was ahead when I suddenly got disconnected and my time ran out,  before I managed to reconnect again.
Bad luck.];W[cp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[fq];B[ck]C[WW: why not C10 ? this way w  gets a perfect extension on both sides and you have no joseki on either.
(at least none that i know :) )];W[cm]C[WW: clearly nicer for W];B[ch]C
[WW: with c9 at c10 you could now extend to c14 depriving W of that  point]

5 th line in the bottom.];B[ek]C[WW: fine :)
now just 1 weak group];W[jd]C[WW: the vial point. W's ponnuki allows everything.]
