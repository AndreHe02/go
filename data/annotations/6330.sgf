C[YusufS [6k\]: hi
YusufS [6k\]: good luck

* Hello and greetings yet to be named GTL reviewer! My name is Yusuf and I want to get stronger, even if it is just one stone, half a stone, a quarter stone stronger! The following  is a game I played on Friday, Dec. 14th, 2007 against a fellow 6 kyu on KGS.

Note: All the comments I put in for you will be marked by a "*".

[Reviewer Comment\]
Hi.  I'm about 3K on IGS and 1k on KGS.  Normally I give about 5 stones handicup to 6Kyu so hopefully I can help you in some ways.  All my comments will be annotated.]
;B[qd]C[Bernard64 [6k\]: hi];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]C[* This is my standard opening. The idea is to created a stable corner in the upper right hand corner while at the same time threatening a move like R10. In my games, white's most common replys were:

1) The wedge at R10,

2) The kakari at Q5, or

3) The kakari at R5

See the variations for how I would respond to each of these moves.


[Reviewer Comment\]: A normal response is R9 actually.  It's a point of Miai makes black's attacks less effective(see variation).  All the other plays are fine as well.  Q5 is very popular.  Again it's personal preference if you know a lot of variations on how to reduce Moyo.]

(;W[qj]C[Most frequently I see the wedge, my response to this is either:

1) R12, or

2) R8

Which is better?

See the variation and the game line for my thoughts.]
(;B[ql];W[qg];B[qo]C[
This sequence is also gote, and is the one I followed in this game. I like it because it doesn't leave a glaring weakness in my shape like the other sequence with R12 did. However, I dislike it because it is gote and gote in the opening, which is especially bad.

Is R5 too passive?

What are better moves here?

[Reviewer Comment\]
It's territory minded.  P8 would be more ambitious and more balanced.  All you plays are on the 3rd line.  Remember 3rd line for territory and 4th line for influence.  But again this is personal preference.  Don't forget about the center in your following moves.   That's all.]
;W[jq]C[[Reviewer Comment\]
Good play on whites part.  The biggest point on the board so far.]
;B[fc]C[Is this the right kakari, or would C14 have been better?

[Reviewer Comment\]
I would go with c6 actually.  Prevent white form a big moyo on the lower left.  But F17 is a perfectly fine move.]
;W[df];B[db]C[[Reviewer Comment\]
K16 leaves more flavor.  D18 is on the second line.  It's okay if you want to settle this part.  But I think you will gote at the end.]
;W[cc];B[ck]C[[Reviewer Comment\]
Too impatient.  D18 seems odd now.];W[ch]C[[Reviewer Comment\]
C11 would have been better. B10 would be sente later on.];B[cn]
;W[co];B[dn];W[fp]C[[Reviewer Comment\]
F4 could be J17 as well.  Make a weak group out of black.];B[ic]
;W[mq]C[
Which side is leading in the opening at this point? and how do you tell?

[Reviewer Comment\]
Too early to tell.  So just be patient and play normal.  Black chose to get territory so white  has more influence.  Center is going to the deciding factor now.]
;B[do]C[[Reviewer Comment\]

Odd move.  Very bad for black.   Now 3-3 is not possible anymore.  Also you don't get much outside influence.  It's a big waste to play this move so early.]
;W[cp];B[hq]C[
The start of the midgame in my opinion.

Black attacks the shape weakness at H3 leading to this...]

;W[gm];B[jn];W[lo];B[kn];W[mo];B[kk]C[Is there a better way for me to get out?

[Reviewer Comment\]
No.  White is happy now because he doesn't have to worry about you forming a moyo around P6 area.   Also he got a lot of territory on the lower left.  So this exchange is bad for black.

Again D5 is really bad move.];W[mm];B[hl];W[lc]C[[Reviewer Comment\]
Good timing];B[kd];W[md];B[ne]C[Now my plan here was to build thickness and attack the R13/R10 group, but it didn't really work..]
;W[me];B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[re]C[
White slides in to solidify his position before Black can attack.

Should I have attacked at R12 instead of making the move at O13?

[Reviewer Comment\]
M12 is urgent.  White is too greedy here.  You don't have to respond to moves that not threaten you much.

R12 is not reasonable.  It's hard to attack white's R13 group from the start.  You can threaten and build you influence on the outside.  To kill is again too much.]

(;B[rd];W[qe];B[pe]C[[Reviewer Comment\]

Q15  is very small.  Attach white's weak group now.];W[pf];B[oe]

I felt that F10 was bad, what was the proper way to connect, and was this move even needed?

In a broader way, I want to know how to decide which moves to make in the midgame and endgame, how do I calculate how many points or how big each move is?

[Reviewer Comment\]
There is no need.  It's in no danger.  S9, T15, B19 are much bigger moves.]

;W[km];B[jl];W[ff];B[fe];W[gf];B[ge];W[sd]C[
Starting here, white pushes me with all these little endgame moves, but since this game was close I think it was White's endgame/yose that won the game for him. White ended up winning by 2.5.

So could you examine my yose and see what I could have done better.

What I especially want to know is how to badger my opponent in sente.

[Reviewer Comment\]

Yose is actually simpler, but you have to look at the whole board before making a move.  Blindly follow will lead to defeat..

For example, you can well play B19.  It's just as big, if not bigger.  That way you don't lose out on yose.  You get a big point, I get another one.  Even-steven.]

;B[da];W[ba];B[jc]C[[Reviewer's Comment\]

Again this bad habit.  This is the same move as D5.  If K19, L19, J19, K17, the difference is 6 points in sente.]
