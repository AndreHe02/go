C[Hello.  I am glad that you are able to do a commentary on this game.  This game will be on the topic of local fighting.  I would be grateful if you could inform me on some good key moves during a critical fight.  I was able to get very lucky in this game, but would like to make my fighting more skill than luck.  I hope i offer enough comments during the game to give you a good idea of what i mean.

  GOOD LUCK!     -TOM];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]
;W[qf];B[nd]LB[pn:A]C["I tried this to make things interesting, it looks nicer here, but not sure why."

Nothing wrong with it, but you can also ignore it.  There is an open corner which is worth playing.  You can also cut at 'A".]
;W[pj]LB[pn:A][nq:B]C[W should connect at 'A' before this.  B must reply at 'B' so W still get to play here.]
;B[pn]LB[qm:B][rn:A]C["This might be a bit pre-mature, but i think its nice to settle my self with a profit.  Perhaps he didn't use it to his full effect."

B can also consider 'A' in sente and then play elsewhere after W 'B', happy that he has made W's shape look silly.]
;W[qm];B[pm]LB[pj:B][on:A]C[This is an overplay.  Better just to play 'A'. W really does not want to play this point because then 'B' is too close. If W does not want to play here then there is no rush for B to do so.]

(;B[no]LB[mm:A]C["I think this gave me a nice advantage because his is a bit closed in with a bit of aji later on."

'A' is better.];W[iq]C["Should he take empty corner or is his extention pivitol?"

Yes, corner is bigger.]
(;B[cd]LB[dc:A]C["Thought this was large because of top right."

This feels like the wrong direction to me.  I prefer 'A'.   Look at the variations shown after W approaches 'A'.]
;W[mq]C[Pointless.  Not even sente.];B[op]LB[dj:A]C[Why?  W is not threatening to pulltthese out. 'A' looks much better]
;W[kp]LB[mq:A]C["I think this is too small for him to worry about.  Perhaps N3 was too far away.  J4 might be better here for more points no?  Maybe even J5"

Horrible move.  W should treat 'A' as kikashi and approach at the top left.  W is now horribly over concetrated.]
;B[cn]LB[dj:B][cm:C][iq:A]C["Is this the best way to approach a strong position?"

Because of the strong position around 'A' W can easily pincer this move.  Therefore the direct approach is not good. Hold back to 'B'.  If W defends around 'C' then B can play at the top.  If W plays at the top then B has this move for later.]
;W[fp]C[Terrible.  Way overconcentrated.  W should pincer.]
;B[bp]LB[dj:A]C['A' is better.  Aim for a moyo around the top left and leave the 3-3 invasion for later.]
;W[ed]C[Good move.]
(;B[gc]C["Decided to give him his hardest time with this pincer.  Is this the strongest joseki with the given positions for me?  Is there a tip or two that can help choosing the right joseki?"

This joseki tends to lead to more settled shapes.  I think a more fluid approach is called for here.]
;W[cc];B[dd]C[This is a very uncommon joseki. Nothing wrong with the usual hane.]

(;B[eb];W[ee]
(;B[bc]LB[fb:A]C[No need to let W play at 'A' in sente.  See variations.]
;W[fb];B[db];W[gd]C["I didn't mind this but doesn't work well with top right."

Which is why B cannot play this way.  The corner can also me sealed in very easily]
;B[cq]LB[hc:B][kc:A]C[Not so important.  B can play either direction here. 'A' is bigger.  This would threaten to play 'B' later but, more importantly, it temporarily stabilizes the top for B]
;W[cl]C[Too late for W once B has taken the corner.  This is just created a potential target for later.]
;B[en];W[dn]C[Funny move.  What is W trying to do?]
(;B[do]C[Wrong side. as the followup shows.];W[co];B[dm];W[bo]

(;B[bn]LB[cp:A]C[B must cut at 'A'. See variations.];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[eo];W[dq]C["Not exactly what i planned."

This sequence is so bad for B that it should have been a losing sequence.]
;B[dj]C[To close.  B is strong here.];W[df];B[rd]LB[kc:A]C[Hard to say which is better. This or 'A']
;W[lc]C[This is bigger than my move i think.];B[jc]LB[df:A]
C["Trying to split him up."

Cannot split when W is strong.  Before W played at 'A' this may have had a chance.]
;W[jd]LB[mc:A]C["This will lead to a failure on my attempt to split him up.  Any tips on escaping succesfully in good or bad shape would be nice."

Best not to even try.  The invasion was ill-advised.   Nothing you try is likely to gain a good result.  Probably better to use 'A' to secure the top right as shown.]

[hh:E][ih:A][jh:C]C["I chose this to block cutting point becuase i didn't want any peeps."

Did the A-D exchange help B or W?  I think B should just have extended to 'E' instead of 'A'  The single B stone would then have aji insteadof being captured.]
;W[dk];B[ek]LB[ih:B][jh:C][cj:A]C[This let's W get away on the side too easily. 'A' is the only move. Once 'B' and 'C' are played B must use them to take the offensive.]
;W[cj];B[dl];W[ck]LB[cj:A]C["Could I have killed him on the side?"

No. Not once W is allowed to play 'A'.  See previous comment.]

;B[hp]LB[qh:B][hn:C][fq:A]C["Not sure if this is good timing or not but it looked like I could make good shape with the top."

Seems like a pity to lose the aji of a cut at 'A'.  I would chose between 'B' (to help protect the top right and reduce the side, or play 'C" to increase the moyo without losing the aji at the bottom.]
;W[gp]C[Funny choice.];B[hq];W[ho];B[ip]C["Big fight ensueing.  Tips on shape and fighting would be very helpful :)."

B is very happy now. This gives B a won game as W has just given away his only bug territory.]

I recently broke a slump of 5k* rank and got up to 1k* or at least I think I am there now.  Anyways, I hope to hear back.

Both players made several reading errors, plus some strategic errors in the beginning.  Look over some of the variations I showed and try to find others.  The ones I gave are only a few possibilities.  There were several places where both players failed to look for the best move to reach the goal.]
