C[To the reviewer:

Thank you very much for reviewing this game.

This game is from the second round of a tournament, the "Vilnius Go Cup 2001".   I would like to ask  you to make comments for both players because I want to discuss this game together with my opponent at our next club meeting.

I'm also asking your permission to publish a Lithuanian translation of your review on the homepage of our Lithuanian Go Federation.

C[This is more often played low at A.  Played high is is hard to find a good answer to a black move at  B.  This move also striked me as a bit inconsistent with the two hoshi.  Hoshi are usually played to create a moyo game but this play seems more designed to immediately break up black's potential moyo.  I would prefer to play at either C or D]
;B[lq];W[jd]LB[dj:A][jp:B][lq:C][jq:D][cn:E]C[The white stones do not seem to be working together. With the sanrensei at the top a white stone at A seems better placed than the one at B.  For example, if the B-C exchange is removed from the board then Wa, Bd, We is better for W]
;B[qj]LB[gp:A]C[While undoubtedly a big point I do not consider it urgent.  A pincer of the white stone at the bottom seems better to me.  I would suggest  A]

(;W[cn]LB[fq:A]C[An alternative is the variation at A]
(;B[cp]LB[jp:A][dn:B]C[This move makes no sense. Black needs to pay more attention to the stone at A.  Look at the variation at B for one possible sequence.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]LB[fp:A][eo:B]C[Not good.  This just helps W stabilize his stones.  If black is going to play this then he should at least play A first.  However, the variation at B looks more interesting.]
;W[fp];B[cl]C[Black's moves are not working well together.  Keeping the single white stone separated gives black a better position.]
;W[fn]LB[en:A]C[A is better.  This makes it too easy for black.]
;B[dn];W[cm]LB[dm:A][cg:B][cj:C][cm:D][ej:E]C[Wrong direction. Even if white saves this stone, which is not guaranteed, he will only exchange a small, confined group for outside strength.  Better is to wait until the right time to play A. I don't actually see a move which appeals to me.  Perhaps Wb, or Wc, Bd, We.]
;B[dm];W[ch]LB[cg:A][cj:B][ci:C]C[Definitely the wrong point.  It leaves white with no follow up.  Holding back to A give white a follow up at B (although W gets the chance to extend to C), while playing at B threates to connect the two white stone out.  This move is in between the two and leaves the corner open to invasion, while not threatening B in any way.]
;B[cj]LB[ko:A][qf:B]C[Definitely a large point, but perhaps a little slow.  A and B are two points which come to mind.]
;W[qh]LB[ql:A][qf:B][oo:C]C[This is the same shape at the left side but this time it is not as bad because of the potential to invade at A.  However, I would hold back to B and aim at C.  Because the white stones at the bottom are subject to attack it is not a good idea to overextend at the top.]
;B[oj];W[oh];B[cf]LB[fc:A][cc:B][ko:C][lo:D]C[Wrong direction.  B is very strong in the lower left so playign so close to that strrength does not make sense.  In the top left B can play either A or B with greater effect.  He can also extend his moyo at the bottom while attacking W with C or D.  Black has no weak groups on the board and has solid territory.  W does not have any secure territory and so black should be more ambitious.]
;W[ef]C[Nice move];B[bh]C[Wrong direction.  B should invade at the 3-3 point.]
;W[ce];B[cg]C[B is far too overconcentrated on the left side. Even though he has a substantial territory there is a feeling than he has not got enough for the number of stones invested.]
;W[pc]LB[oc:A]C[I prefer A]
(;B[fc]LB[eb:A]C[At this point lack is ahead in solid territory but white has a large moyo.  On the other hand, black has no weak groups which white can exploit, but white has the four stones at the bottom which black can torment.  These four stones will not die, or even come close to it, but they do provide black with some leverage to reduce the white moyo.  Therefore, atthis stage, black does best to invade the white moyo without creating a weak group.  This is NOT the move for that.    Look at the variation at A]
;W[dc]LB[eb:A]C[Wa looks better.];B[ic]LB[jb:A]C[Too heavy.  This move should have been punished more severely.  Playign at A is a lighter move]
;W[jc];B[id]C[Another heavy move.  This permits W to "hane at the head of two stones".  Jumping away lightly is much better.]

(;W[je]LB[ie:A]C[Hane at A, with the follow up shown , is much better.]
;B[jr]LB[fe:A][ko:B]C[Terrible.  Black does not have the time to leave the three stones at the top.  W has played a slack move at the top and black should take advantage of it.  I would play A threatening to cut off the corner..  Although the move played  undercuts the white stones they are not in much danger.  If black is going to play against this group he should play the leaning attack of B which at least build up some center strength to help in the reduction of the white moyo at the top.]
;W[ql]LB[ie:A]C[A pointless move.  The 3 black stones at the top and the 4 white stones at the bottom are unsettled and are far more urgent.  By invading white risk creating a second weak group and then, with two weak groups to one, he will be at a disadvantage.  As the black stones at the top are weaker than the white ones at the bottom the simple play is probably the best.  Just play at A]
;B[qk]LB[qi:A]C[I prefer A];W[ol];B[rl]LB[mj:A]C[By playing on the 2nd line black let's white get away with the invasion.  Black should be looking to creating a splitting attack on the two white groups.  Jumping to A is adequate, threatening to invade the top right moyo while continuing to threaten a splitting attack. Also, playing out into the center may indirectly help the top black group.]
;W[qm]C[Looks heavy];B[rm];W[oo]LB[on:A][nn:B][oq:C]C[Bad shape. A is the correct shape, but here it is probably too heavy and B is better.  Before playing either of these I would play at C to see how black responds]
;B[pn]LB[on:A]C[This is rarely a good move in this shape.  A looks far more interesting.]
;W[on]
(;B[pm]LB[nm:A]C[This cannot be expected to acheive much except to make the small capture of two stones.  A move at A  looks far more interesting -- look at the variation]
;W[om];B[pl]LB[np:A]C[Small.  White gains little by connecting so there is no need for black to capture.  Securing the bottom with A and keeping up the attack is much better.]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[oq]C[There is a distinct feeling that black has been outplayed here.]
;B[or];W[nq];B[nr]LB[ko:A]C[Crawling along the 2nd line in what was once black moyo is painful. Fighting spirit requires that black come out at A and presever the option to connect later.  This approach does have risks, but black is behind and cannot afford to play moves like this one.]
;W[lp]C[White has completed a succesful invasion and has connect all his stones together.  He now has a definite lead in the game.]
;B[mp]LB[fe:A]C[Black has little to gain by continuing the attack.  Worse still, if he is not careful he may end up with gote.  it is time to turn his attention to the black group at the top.  Until that is settled black cannot afford to do anything with the top right.  It is probably time to play A]
;W[mq];B[kp];W[lo];B[kq];W[ko];B[ip];W[io];B[jq]C[Black has acheived little except gote.]
;W[hf]LB[mr:A]C[Good move.  Black had to prevent this attack at all costs.  With white A still available it is hard to see how black can win this game now]
;B[eb];W[db]LB[gb:A]C[White could consider making it hard for black by playing at A, but he really does not need it and the corner could have problems.  This is probably the simplest way to ensure a win.]
;B[gb];W[lh]LB[mi:A]C[A bit restrained.  White can play A with little risk.]

;W[ei];B[fh];W[eh];B[im]LB[hm:A]C[This is very painful for white but once he has played A there is little he can do.]

(;W[jm]C[Pointless.  It loses the aji of the white stone.];B[il]
;W[jl];B[ej]LB[ik:A][hm:B][eo:C][jk:D]C[This does not work.  Black needs to find a way to play which will force white play atari at A and allow black to remove the stone at B. Then C will threaten the cut.  With this in mind the best move for black is probably a double hane starting with D.]
;W[dj];B[ci];W[fg];B[gh]LB[nh:A][rh:B][jk:C]C[Too small. Black needs to find a way to reduce the white territory at the top.  A and B are two points to aim at and the hane at  C is still a big point to play.]
;W[ik]C[As shown earlier, this is exaclty the point which black wants white to play and this makes it a very bad move.]
;B[hl];W[hi];B[gi];W[qp];B[rp];W[po];B[qn];W[mj]LB[nk:A][kj:B]
[mm:C][nj:D]C[This cannot be right.  With the black move at A left behind this move seems to be concentrating more on claiming territory around B instead of around C.  D would see to be more severe]

(;B[jk]LB[eo:A][ij:B][ig:C]C[B should be aiming at A but he cannot play that yet -- see variation.  However, if W responds at B then this does not help black.  Moving out with a move like C seems better]
;W[kk]LB[ij:A]C[A is better];B[jj];W[kj]C[White has given up too much here]
;B[ji];W[dk];B[ck];W[pi]LB[rh:A]C[Nice move -- protects against  A in sente]
;B[ok];W[nk]LB[mr:A][ib:B]C[Not so big considering it is gote.  If black plays here white loses only about 6-8 points.  A and B are bigger.]

[fr:C]C[Small.  Gains little for white as he is alive in the corner.  A and B are big reverse sente plays and C is sente.]
;B[df]LB[ri:A][ka:B]C[I had trouble finding this move when reviewing - it is only 2+ points in gote.  A and B are huge by comparison.  In fact, if black were to play both these points in sente he is still in with a chance of winning.]
;W[ns];B[pr];W[ep]LB[er:A]C[Bad.  When B decents to A white has lost a lot]
;B[er];W[fr];B[eo];W[fo]LB[gp:A]C[Better at A in sente]

White gave black plenty of chances to win but it seems that black did not count the game at crucial points.  If he had done so he would have realized he was behind and needed to play more agressively.]
