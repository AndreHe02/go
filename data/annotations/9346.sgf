AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[At the first pass (mv 197) white was ahead by 2.5.  I'm hoping for advice on bigger moves, better responses and more efficient play.  White got a nice moyo on the top, but I knew it was still close at the end.  I'm trying to avoid following my opponent, so please point out any moves that did not need a response.]
PL[W];W[fc];B[cf];W[nc];B[qf]LB[jd:A]C[Would a play around A have been better?]

;W[el];B[fk];W[fl];B[gk]C[should I hane again here instead? i'm worried about leaving lots of cutting points.]

(;W[ee]C[This move does not accomplish much. Black does not need to respond directly, but can do so by defending the corner solidly, or attacking the white stones.]

(;B[dg]C[This is too passive.];W[eh];B[ei];W[dh];B[ch];W[fi]
;B[di];W[ec];B[jj]
(;W[ii]C[This doesn't seem the right move to protect the white moyo.]

(;B[ij]C[Again, black is too passive. This move requests white to reinforce the wall and turn the moyo into solid territory.]
;W[oh]C[This is too aggressive by white. There is a huge gap in the wall. An indirect attack on the corner is too slow at this point.]

(;B[ph]C[Attaching to an attacking stone like this will make the white stone stronger. It invites white to extend from it.]
;W[oj];B[pk];W[mk];B[li]C["instead of defending the last move, i wanted to see if white would respond to my walking in."

That is the correct idea. The white moyo is huge, and if black lets white finish this wall, this is a problem. However, L12 would be a bit more of a direct attack.]
;W[kh]
(;B[ki];W[lh]
(;B[kk];W[mi];B[qp]C[Good. White missed the last chance to invade here. If black now starts playing defensively (taking the top right corner if given the chance, then the bottom left corner, ... it should be an easy enough win.

When you start with a big handicap, just playing defensively is a good strategy. Black is still leading with more than fifty points at this point. That is a lot of points. Invading white might be big too, but if you're not certain, it might evolve into a huge fight for the entire game.]
;W[jd]C["could black have invaded here and lived?"

That is a good question. There are quite a few defects in the white position. I, myself, might have tried an invasion here, but I am known to be an aggressive player. Protecting the corner was probably the best move.]

(;B[bq]C[The correct idea: protect what you have.];W[nq];B[oq]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[op];B[or]C[Looks good so far. Black still leads by 50 points, and white now needs to fight. When white wants to fight here, black should make sure to get moves like Q6 or Q7, settling the entire right side.]
;W[no]
(;B[oo];W[on];B[pn]C["should I have connected instead?"

That would let white cut through. I prefer this, but have a look at the comment at move 60.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[oo];B[pm]C[The same result, but now white has much better shape.]

(;W[om]
(;B[ol];W[nl]
(;B[kp];W[jn]C[White can either try to connect to the left or the right. However, connecting to the left might be tricky, and black would use that to turn the bottom left group into a big chunk of solid points.]

Yes, that would make it hard for white to connect.];W[ln];B[kn]

(;B[bo]C[This is gote, and a lot smaller than preventing white Q18. It is good to know these endgame tesuji, though.]

This move is not big. It prevents white from playing M2, which would be gote for white. That means this move is double gote (gote for both). Those moves normally get played last.]
