C[My name is Jeffrey Goetsch, I am currently a 3kyu on KGS (jgoetsch) and play as 1-2 kyu(AGA) at my local go club.  I have been playing for 1 year, so I might make some reading mistakes in my comments, but the strategy of the moves should be solid.  All my comments will start with "JAG:" 

JAG: You made big mistakes, but black also made mistakes which aloud the game to get as close as it was.  I did not see a lot of invasions, which makes me think that you should look try playing around with more of them.

JAG: Hope this review helps.  If you have any questions, you can email me at jag_home@hotmail.com.


I played this game during the last Paris Tournament. I had white. I made reading mistake in the middle game, and from then on I tried to reduce white as much as possible. I ended up winning by 1.5.

I don't have the last moves, but I don't think they're important.]

(;B[ic]C[I had never seen this fuseki before. Now I know it's called the mini-chinese.

JAG: Another popular variation is the K16 point.];W[ed]C[I wasn't sure of how to handle it, so I decided to go for the standard kakari.]
;B[ie];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd];W[gc];B[ee];W[fe]
C[JAG: This is an over play which you saw how he could have retaken the corner.]
;B[ec];W[fd]C[After playing this I noticed he could capture the corner. Luckily, he didn't notice either.]

(;B[ef];W[eb]C[I was glad to be given the opportunity to capture the black stone.]
;B[dk];W[jp];B[qn];W[qk]C[I thought this pincer would make a nice extension too.]
;B[on];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[ne];W[ob]C[I wanted to protect the corner, but I ended up feeling unhappy with this move.

JAG: Yes this move is very slow for this point in the game.  Black answered your move which was a mistake for him.]

(;B[nb]C[Here I noticed I hadn't really protected the corner, but I didn't want to play here again now.]
;W[fq]C[This seemed bigger

JAG: Your previous move was not good, but you were smart to leave it.]
;B[eq]LB[jp:A]C[JAG: This is a mistake by black.  It is exactly what you are wanting.  You play the natural move which gives you a perfect extension from you 2 stone wall (F3-4) with A and when the sequence finishes you can still invade the corner.  See variation.]
;W[fp];B[dn]C[JAG: It is too soon to do the variation, but just to show you what is possible.]

(;W[na]LB[ok:A]TR[on][qn][rp]C[JAG: This is a mistake in 2 ways.  First it is too slow for this point in the game.  I would attack blacks weak group R6 by playing A which you do on your next move.  See variation for 2 part of the mistake.]
;B[ma]C[Again, I felt I had chosen the wrong move]
(;W[ok]C[JAG: This is a very good move. 

Now I think N6 would have been better];B[mn];W[no]LB[lp:A]C[My idea with this move was to reinfoce the connection between O4 and K4 without losing sente

JAG:  This does strengthen the connection, but leaves open the possibility of an invasion which is shown later on.  I would play A which really makes the whole side look like your territory.]
;B[nn];W[ng]SQ[ok][qk]C[This move now feels too loose, the corner being so weak.

JAG: I think the is a good move.  It is a little weak, but with the mark wall, you can put up a good fight.]
;B[of];W[og];B[pf];W[qg];B[pb]
(;W[oc]C[JAG: This is a mistake as you found out later.  You need to just take the lose of the two stones and solidify the corner.]
;B[pc];W[nd];B[oa];W[od];B[md];W[nf]C[This was clearly a reading mistake.

JAG: even without this mistake, black has taken away your corner.]
;B[qd]C[Having lost the corner, I felt I have to go all out to reduce black if I wanted to stand a chance]
;W[cf]C[JAG: This is an over play.  Black makes the correct response, but doesn't flow it through correctly.

I decided to start here. The shape was kind of an invitation.]
;B[cg];W[dg]
(;B[ch];W[df];B[bf];W[dh];B[ci];W[di];B[cj];W[de]SQ[ee][ef]
C[JAG: This move is a mistake.  Even though it looks like you are cutting marked stones off, they can still live and become cutting stones.]

(;B[fn]C[JAG: This is a mistake for black.  It asks for you to solidify your position there.  See the possible invasion variation.]
;W[go];B[fi]C[JAG: Another mistake and you take advantage of it.]

;B[jm];W[hm];B[rq];W[rr];B[qp];W[pq];B[ab];W[cq]C[I had been looking at this point for a while, and I didn't feel it would stay open much longer, so I went for it.]

C[Again, trying to reduce as much as possible.];B[jb];W[hb]
;B[mf];W[jc];B[kb];W[id];B[jd];W[hc];B[kd];W[em]C[The same idea]
;B[en];W[jn];B[kn];W[hn];B[kl];W[pg];B[pe]LB[qe:A]C[JAG: black should respond A]
;W[fm];B[gf];W[ff];B[gg]
(;W[hk]C[JAG: It is better to make territory ar the same time.  I had a little fun with it (mean it is long variation), but it shows you some possibilities.

I was afraid of black making any territory in the center.];B[hi]
;W[he]LB[mj:A]C[JAG: Again this seems the wrong direction. I would do A.]
;B[if];W[hf];B[hg];W[ig]
(;B[ih]C[JAG: Wrong direction for black.];W[jg];B[je];W[mg]
;B[lf];W[lg];B[lj];W[ki]C[JAG: This point is not worth any points.  Do you think you can cut off the center group? If not, it is better to play the yose on the edges, because the are worth more points.]

(;B[kh];W[kg];B[jh];W[jj];B[ej];W[rm];B[rn];W[qm]C[This is all I have, but now it's clearly  yose. I never had a feeling of being leading, but I ended up winning by 1.5. I suppose I was kind of lucky.]
