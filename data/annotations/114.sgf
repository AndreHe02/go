;B[pe];W[rf];B[og];W[jp]L[ge]C[ ** Nice move. Alternatives would be  the kakari in the lower right, the shimari in   the lower left, or a).]
;B[do];W[dl];B[lq]L[lp]C[Dubious? That's my style!  Satisfied with having prevented my opponent
from making a shimari, I tenuki and take profit elsewhere. That way
I don't feel the pressure to get a very good result in lower left.
 ** Interesting. Black could also play one line higher at a).];W[cp]L[fp]
C[ ** This move is sometimes seen in the Chinese fuseki. It aims  at making   it hard for black to settle himself. I think a) is just as good here.]

(;B[eq];W[co];B[dp]L[dn][dr][hq][hp]C[Reverts to the small nadare, maybe I  should play 'a' here instead?   ** This feels a bit heavy - black is playing inside whites sphere of   influence remember. I think b), aiming at getting a quick life, or   a 'lighter' move at c) or d) would be better.]
;W[dr];B[fo]M[lq]L[fp]C[I think this  is a decent result for Black: the marked stone is at
a fairly good place and middle and lower right quarter of the board is
starting to become a black moyo.   ** Black should be a bit apprehensive since he is still not settled   inside the white framework.
 Whites stone is beginning to look isolated which is the main problem   with white not answering the black kakari with a).
 See Var. 1.]
(;W[po]M[jp]C[ ** The important issue at  this stage is the balance of strength between the   single marked white stone, and the four black stones on the left - in effect
 these stones are engaged in a running battle. I would therefore prefer a  move   more directly connected with the marked stone (see Var. 1).]

(;B[pp]M[lq]L[qo][nq][op][oo]C[The "attach-and-draw-back" joseki starting  at 'a' would leave the marked
stone on the wrong place (too far to omit 'b'/'c' and too close if
it's played). Is there a better chioce? I rejected a pincer, since
the right side is open at the edge after the top-right joseki.
'd' could be an alternative, but again I feel the marked stone is too
close.
 ** Defending the cornerstone leads to duplication of effort. I would prefer
 a pincer or an attack on the white stone on the left (see Var. 1).]
(;W[qo]M[jp]C[ ** This move helps black to isolate the marked white stone.]
;B[oo];W[on];B[nn];W[no];B[op]
(;W[om]L[nm]C[ Better to give the atari at  a) I think (previous variation).]
;B[nm]L[fl]C[I'm pushing from behind, but  I want to build up my moyo in sente and
follow up with a move at 'a'.
 ** Good. White can't afford to push here so he should probably play as in  Var. 1.]

(;W[ol];B[nl]C[Just one more push...];W[nk]L[ok][pg]C[Whoops! I  and my opponent decided after the game that this should have
been at 'a'. White would then also have the aji of a big cut through
the keima at 'b'.];B[ok];W[mk];B[mo]L[pk][oj]C[To protect against crane's nest.
 **The atari at a) seems crude, whereas b) is something of a do-or-die move  that   seems not quite to work (see Var. 1). Consequently Var. 2 seems the best  option
 for white.]
(;W[pk]C[Var B. seems impossible to white.];B[oj];W[pj];B[oi];W[ge]L[gm]
M[do][fo][dp][eq]C[ ** a) is probably bigger since it threatens to  isolate the marked stones.   White can't expect black to answer here since the centre is on a larger   scale.]
;B[hd]L[fl][hc][cc]M[df][ge][dl]C[I was very  tempted to take the point 'a' here and let my opponent have
the invasion 'b' at the top. I've got 'c' if things get though up there.
 ** A move around a) would be the meeting point between two moyos (the   white moyo beeing created by the marked stones). There is a proverb   about such points!]
;W[fl]L[hk][gm]C[ ** Seems much to slow. If  the black group in the lower left was solid a)   would be my choice. As it is now, probably b) is best.]
;B[er]C[I'm  quite pleased with this move. It's not the kind of move I usually
play, though.
 ** Certainly very big. However, I don't think black can expect white to   answer here at this stage. (See Var. 1).]

(;W[dn]L[cn]C[ ** I don't think  white has time for this. Anyway a) is the proper move here.   If black cuts at a) white has to answer in the corner.]
;B[en]C[  ** Looks like a thank-you-move (black has better options here).]
;W[dm];B[gl]L[gm][hm][hl][gn]C[I had a long think before this move. My alternatives  were 1) 'a' - but
then White would probably push at #53, 2) 'b' - White plays 'c', and
3) 'c' - but it leaves an annoying gap at 'a'. What's your virdict?   ** The move you played looks best for sealing off the lower side.  The   centre is large also, but possibly the black group at the bottom is to   fragile to justify b) or c). The problem I find with b) is that white   might answer d) and it's not easy to catch that stone... a) may seem   slow but could be a good move.]
;W[gk];B[hl]C[ ** Black would like to  hane here. If this is not possible the tsuke at g8   looks less attractive.]
;W[hk]
(;B[ik]M[mk][nk]L[il]C[Maybe I should have  restrained myself to 'a', but I wanted to capture the
two marked stones and the area around them. Too greedy?
 ** I can understand why you want to play this hane. It is a dangerous move,   however - it is very difficult to patch up the black shape. Probably black   should bide his time at a) (see previous variation).]
;W[il]M[pj][pk]L[gn][hn]C[ ** The  way black plays in the following is similar to whites play on the   right (the marked stones). Again a jump - to a) or b) - would normally   be better style, so black should consider these moves if he wants to hold on   to the cutting stone at j9. The variations are complicated because of the   weakness of blacks group in the lower left.]
;B[im];W[jl];B[jm];W[kl]
(;B[ij]M[il][jl][kl][mk][nk]L[km]C[ ** This looks  like a bit of an overplay. Again black should probably seal
 off the lower side with a) (see previous variation). Black is  jeopardising   what has up till now been a favourable game for him, and if white lays waste   to the lower side he might find himself having to kill the marked stones to   stay in the game.]
;W[kj]L[ji]C[ ** a) looks more effective and might  put black on the spot.]
;B[ih];W[km];B[ko]L[jo][jn][hn]C[Trying to mend my bad  shape. What about 'a' or 'b' (sic!) instead?
 ** With the played move or a) black really should collapse as in Var. 1.   Black should protect his cutting point and his shape by playing c). It's
 the proper move. He still has a fair chance of killing white.]
(;W[gn];B[hm]C[Seemed to be the only choice.];W[fm]M[hk][gk][fl]L[jn]
C[This gives  me a chance to fix my shape, I think 'a' for example would
have been more dangerous for me.
 ** I think white is protecting the marked stones here. He judges   (probably rightly) that capturing the lefthand group is just as big   as the white group in the middle. The danger, of course, is that   black may play in such a way as to save both the five centre stones   as well as the left-hand group.]
;B[io];W[mi]L[hp]C[ ** White could  also play a).];B[mg]L[mh]C[Or 'a'??
 ** The played move is fine - don't touch what you are attacking.];W[kh]
;B[ji];W[ki];B[jf]L[if][kf]C[ ** a) might be better here  since white's attachment at b) seems quite   effective.]
;W[ml]L[kf][nh]C[ ** White is just about alive with the a) followed by  b) combination.]
;B[go];W[mn];B[np];W[mm];B[no];W[jh]L[kf][nh]C[ **  Serves no purpose. If white wants to nake absolutely certain that he's   alive he could play a) and b) now.]
;B[ig];W[jj]C[ ** Only  strengthens black.];B[ii];W[ln]L[kf]M[jh][jj]
C[ ** Since a) is no longer sente white now  has to go back to defend.
 Passing would have been preferrable to playing the marked stones!];B[dh]
;W[kf];B[pi]L[pb][rp][qj][ke]C[This was for strengthening  my connection and give me sente plays at 'a',
'b' and  (maybe) 'c'. Maybe my game is too complex; the simple move at
'd' is natural and very big.
 ** Unless this is sente against the right-hand group, d) seems clear-cut.]
;W[kd]C[ ** Painful.];B[pb];W[qb];B[qa];W[ra];B[pa];W[sb];B[rp];W[qm]C[I  think I should have played the vital point myself instead.
 ** Attacking at the vital point directly certainly seems very dangerous   for white.]
;B[ke];W[le];B[kg]L[je]C[Decideas to cut White off...
 ** Has to be at a).];W[je];B[ie]C[... but changes my mind. This  was no good!]
;W[lg];B[ke];W[jg];B[kc];W[db]C[White was beginning to suffer  from time trouble and I started to play
faster too.];B[ld];W[fh];B[ce]L[de][cf][ee]C[A probe.  If White answers  at 'a', I can play 'b' and life on the edge looks possible. If he
answers 'b', 'c' becomes my sente to help me connect.
 ** A high level strategy! Very good.];W[cf];B[eg]L[ee][ef][de][ff]
C[ ** Wrong order. If  we assume black a), white b), black c), black wouldn't   exchange the played move for d).]
;W[ff];B[ee];W[de]L[ef][be]C[  ** Has to be a). White still gets most of the corner after b).]
;B[ef];W[ed];B[fe];W[fd];B[gd];W[hn];B[ho]L[ip]C[ ** a)  seems simpler and more safe.]

;W[fn]M[fe][ee][ef][eg][dh]L[fk][cq]C[White lost on time. The semeai is  very hairy, locally it looks like a ko.
The question is if Black's cut at 'a' can change anything.
 ** Black must be prepared to give up the marked stones if he either cuts   directly at a), or if he plays the ko. He should have no problems winning   the fight by taking the ko straightaway - he has 5 local ko threats beginning
 with b) for example.];B[gf]L[fk]M[fe][ee][ef][eg][dh]C[ ** This cut  might be an idea for black. It aims at keeping the marked   stones while at the same time eliminating whites main source of ko threats.
 It furthermore revives the threat of the cut at a).];W[ds]C[ ** This is a  sneaky move from white.]
;B[fp]L[fk][gg][pf][ne][nh][qp]C[ ** But if  black preserves 6 liberties he is safe. If white protects   his cutting point at a) next, all black has to do is start the ko
 which he wins with 5 local threats in the lower left corner to whites
 5 marked b) to f).];W[eo]C[ ** If white takes a liberty.];B[gr]C[ **  Black of course first takes the ko.]
;W[gg];B[hf];W[fr];B[fk]M[gk][hk]L[el][hs]C[ ** And then  after the cut all his moves in the semeai against the marked   stones (and later also a)) will act as ko threats. The maximum number of   liberties white can get on the outside is 5, so he can't afford to give   in to the ko by playing b).]
