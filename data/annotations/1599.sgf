C[Hi, my name is Sebastien (zbuh) and I played Black in this game. I'm more interested in comments on the early game as the later game is spoiled by the pointless overplays I made in attempt to catch up with White. I wrote a few specific questions in the course of the game.

> I think you played fairly well overall, fairly calmly. The problem seems to be that you are far too afraid at certain key moves and fail to make use of the thickness you are building all over the board.
> In particular, adding stones to your thick group at the bottom instead of capturing White (as commented in the game) was a big mistake which lead to you falling behind.
> You also got a joseki mixed up at the bottom... Anyway, the real problem was that you did not punish White's many overplays. Enjoy the review :)]

(;B[fo]LB[jp:C][lp:A][fq:B]C[zbuh: Is this acceptable? What moves do you recommend?
> It looks a bit tame, perhaps you would like to consider a double approach move here, since white has given you so much space? If
> you play this move, you should at least continue with a pincer around A afterwards to use your framework on the right properly.
> Even so, white will have quite a bit of space after the pincer.
> If you dont like the variations, maybe you would prefer to play B at C in the first place, which is quite common?]
;W[cm]C[> This looks like an invitation to invade the corner by white..]

(;B[dr]TR[jp]C[> This move is best avoided since it makes white secure and instantly gives away territory without anything in return. The marked stone is far away!]
;W[cq];B[ir]LB[ip:A]C[> I have never seen this move, this is normally played when white is at A. You should not really be afraid about your own eye space in this position, you have
> plenty of stones on the right, you should attack with a pincer instead.. This move has no effect on white, who can tenuki or make an approach move]
;W[jr];B[iq];W[jq]C[> These are very heavy moves by white..]
;B[mq]C[> Good.. finally the pincer :)];W[qh]TR[qh][jp][jq]
[jr]C[> Seems like an overplay to leave the stones at the bottom unattended. The word 'splitting attack' should come to mind here.. so you want to chase the lonely

(;B[qg]C[zbuh: Same question : is this acceptable, what moves do you recommend?
> You should probably try to engineer a splitting attack.. you are also making white stronger by playing this kosumi. It also does not make any territory because it leaves a peep]
;W[ph];B[me];W[nh];B[mc]C[zbuh: I think this was bad. But I feel I need another move in the top right and I can't find any which is likable.
