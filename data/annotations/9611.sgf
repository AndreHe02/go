C[Hi Ramon, 

With sincere apologies for the lateness of this review, particularly because I konw you have been waiting already a number of weeks!  

I understand you would like to focus on the opening, particularly because black played one that was unusual for you.  I'll post my comments with the header "DB:"]
;B[og]C[DB: Unusual indeed!];W[dp];B[mo];W[dd];B[nc]C[I'm very curious about this opening for Black. It's not a common opening and I was not sure how to best approach it.

DB:  It is certainly focussed on infuence over territory.  At first glance it can look rather intimidating, but black has virtually no hold over the corners and the right side.  Black seems to be daring white to enter the right side, so that black can start a fight.]

(;W[po]LB[pl:1][pq:2]TR[mo]C[This side looks more open so I came, so I play this.

DB: But where are the biggest areas?  Yilun Yang (9p) wrote a great book called "Fundamental Principles of Go" - here he suggests a "priority" of moves.  That is, which moves are most urgent and when?  A great book for anyone up to mid-Dan I think. 
   For me, I would not enter the right side just yet - I would rather build my own influence up (like D10) and wait and see what black has in mind.  Another principle to think of (I owe this one to Lance Kemper (shygost on KGS) is that any stone played should have 3 directions to move.  Black's N5 stone, to some extent, has removed one direction from white, leaving 2 obvious directions: towards the side, or towards the corner (the numbers indicate only the directions, not a specific move). But it is still 2 lines away from white, so it isn't the most pressure that black could put on the white stone.  Still, I would prefer to play with 3 directions, rather than two.]
;B[pq]LB[pl:1]C[To me this looks contradictory to the other stones Black has place on the board.

DB:  Agreed.  Black wants a fight I think.  Q3 reduces the corner from white, giving white one fewer directions to move.  Now white has only 1 unobstructed direction to move: his options are more limited.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qk];B[qi]C[DB:  this looks like a fair exchange for white.  You have a nice stable group on the side.  Black has now developing something resembling a moyo on the bottom, but it is facing a white D4 corner, so the bottom side will not become a monster moyo for black.  R11 seems to want to close-in the upper side, but this is not going to be easy for black since his stones are very loosely associated together.]
;W[ok]C[DB:  good, don't let black seal you in.];B[fd];W[df]
;B[ff];W[dh];B[fh]C[DB: black is trying to build a moyo on the top, but white is building real profit.]

(;W[ej]C[DB: I don't like E10.  It appears to try to put pressure on the black group, but black's stones can settle with a single move around K16.  Also, E10 is 5 lines from the side, so has little influence on the left side.  It is neither building profit for white, nor pressuring black's stones significantly.]
;B[gj]LB[jd:A][pd:B][gk:C]TR[qd]C[[DB: white plays at R16\]

I'm not sure if my timing was good. I.e. should I have enter earlier. Also, I was debating on entering near A or near B (as I did with 22), or even not doing anything and simply playing on my side at C.

DB:  For me, I would rule out C altogether.  This contacts a black group that doesn't yet have a base (so black would be strengthened) and builds white strength in an area that isn't that big for white.  

I'll try to play out A, B, and C to show what I'm thinking.  It's always very tenuous for kyu players (like me) to play out a sequence, since we are too easily mistaken.  So I'll try not to get carried away.]

(;W[qd]LB[jd:A][pd:B][gk:C];B[qf]C[DB:  White should focus on getting out to the centre - escape before living!  one should always strive to give your groups a "future"  - meaning that if you allow your group to be surrounded, it no longer has any influence on the rest of the game.]

(;W[rf]C[DB:  Why here?  this only leads to white living small and surrounded.]

(;W[ng]C[DB: nicely done.  Now white has a corner *and* a future.  Mind you, this is only possible because of black's blunder on the top side (see alternative move 31).  Although this is complicated if black cuts.]
;B[nf]C[DB: complicated.];W[pe];B[of]TR[ng]C[DB:  that's too bad.  now O13 is virtually useless.]

(;W[ij]C[DB: Why centre?  The bottom side is still unplayed.  Corners first, then sides, last centre.]
;B[gl];W[el]C[DB: this is running along the 5th line.  If white is going to convert the left side into profit, he will need to play atleast one more move closer to the edge.]

[kc]SQ[ji]C[DB:  black still needs another move to "finish" this moyo.  White has a shape problem to fix still, since black can cut at K11.]

(;W[nq]C[DB:  I think this is not a good move. Black can be cut, but white would be left with a weak group, while black would be pretty strong, locally.]

(;B[fj];W[dl]TR[jd][ni][jj]C[DB: if black's stones are to make a significant moyo, he still needs a move around the K16 area, one around the centre, and finally one around O11 to prevent white's group from walking in.  So simply running along the side at the 4th line is a nice situation for white, I think.]
)))
(;W[dj]C[DB: for me, I would be perfectly comfortable playing calmly.  I cannot see a move 7 for black that would give him any kind of major advantage.  N5 is too far into the centre to have any significant influence along the right side or corner, and could only have limited influence on the bottom side.  The same goes for the two upper right stones - the corner is wide open.  If black turns back to the corners on the right side, white can continue to build influence.  If black invades white's corners, white can build considerable thickness right away.  If black continues to build this very vague centre-focussed influence, white can continue to focus on the sides and corners.]
