AB[pd][dp][pp]C[YRai: Hi I played black here against a 14kyu player^^ I have a few questions concerning my defense marked :D Thank you for takimg your time helping me :D

William: No Problem. I Haven't been studying up on my game as much as I used to, so I apologize if
my review isn't quite as detailed as you would like. But hopefully I can show you a few things that might improve your game.]
;W[dd]C[William: You have 3 handicap, so slow and stead isn't a bad policy to follow.]
;B[fc]C[William: Normal first move, completely fine.];W[cf]
;B[db];W[cc]
(;B[fe]C[William: This move is not quite joseki, although with the handicap stone at Q16 this move actually isn't quite as bad.
Usually the correct move is j17. But keep in mind, this group doesn't have a base yet, it can still be attacked. While white's
group is pretty much settled in.];W[cn];B[fp];W[cq]
(;B[dq];W[cp]C[YRai: Playing C5 here seems to be  mistake.... Would playing D6 be better? I don't really like the shape this leads to....

William: Yes, playing C5 does seem like a mistake here. I wouldn't play D6 either, attaching here without a clear way too cut
seems bad because it just makes white stronger. I'm not sure of the best move, but D5, E6..etc..seem like better moves.
Of course, too, you can always tenuki, that's sometimes better than playing a bad move if you are unsure.]
;B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[dn];B[en];W[qn]C[William: You'll notice here that there is a cut and possibly ladder at B6.  The ladder is good for black, so white has to be careful.
of course, if he lets black take the corner than he gets some nice influence, so he may not be too concerned.]

[nc:A][pe:1]C[William: This is a move you need to learn NOT to do. Always extend one more space to 1 if white has a stone at A. White
can pull back on his next move and play at 2 to punish you. Please see the branches to see the punishment.]

(;W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc]C[ YRai: Until this point I was quite satisfied with the influence towards the center I gained but I somehow lost a lot of it during the game

William: Yes, you have a lot of influence, and that is how you won, but maybe you are trying to think all the area you deserve. In Go
you only have to win by 1 point, so don't try and win everything. Also, just because you surround something, doesn't mean it is 
absolutely yours, you have to be flexible. if they are intent on entering sometimes you have to let them, but you will win in the end
if you play the right moves.];W[hd];B[hf];W[kc];B[jc]C[YRai: This was a misclick^^' I wanted to pay K16 and not K17
William: Yeah, don't know if playing K16 is much better, but attaching here is by far the worst thing you can do.
You have so much strength with your stones around the white stones that it shouldn't be that hard to kill. And
even if white lives, he will be so sealed in you can use the influence to make points elsewhere. It's a win
win wituation.];W[jd];B[kd]C[YRai: I wonder if it would have been better to play J17 instead of L16 but i wanted to push him towards the edge ^^' Am I maybe too focused on gaining influence towards the center?

William Ott: Yes, this can get a little technical here on if white can survive or not. A good rule of thumb for these
kinds of problems is to not try and kill, but try and gain influence or territory by attacking. (of course
sometimes you HAVE too kill) 
But the focus is in the center for black you are right. Even at this point, It seems hopeless for white if black
can get the center that large.];W[ic];B[jb];W[kb];B[je];W[id]
;B[mc]C[William: I'm not sure if this move is worth playing, not worth very many points.]

TR[hj]C[William: This is not a good move, E7 is far superior, or really anything around the triangle would pretty much seal off
all that territory for black and be game over for white.];W[cm]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[ck]C[William: Don't play like this. It leaves too many cutting points. There is a go proverb: A rich man doesn't shouldn't pick quarrels.
If you are this far ahead you shouldn't make weak groups that can be cut easily. Think strong shapes and solid position.s]
;W[bk]
(;B[jj];W[eo]C[YRai: At this point he started to attck from the left and I had a really hard time defending an lost the corner in the end... Was my defense too weak to begin with or could I still have prevented him from cutting my stones like that?

William: Yes, your defence was too weak, but even if he cuts here it is not the end of the world. Always think
sacrafice if you can't save a position. The main thing is you have too many cutting points, you should
of let him get more territory if necessary and make a stronger position that can't be cut.]

(;B[hr]C[YRai: Would it have been better to play F3 and avoid a ko? Or would it change nothing?

William: Yes, F3 is better all around. You never want to start a KO for no reason if you can avoid it.
This KO is only good for white, black should avoid it if possible.]

C[YRai: Here I decided to sacrifice the stone on G6 in order to prevent him from going into the center any further but it seems like the loss was greater than expected.

William: That's fine. 1 stone is only worth 1 point sometimes, think biggest move always.]

Is it just that my defense is too weak or do I play to fast at a different place leaving behind a not fuull protected group?

William: Your defense isn't as bad as you think. I really think if you want to improve you should play life and death problems ( without
the solultions if possible). But I'm sure you will progress quickily if you keep trying to improve and study and practice.]
