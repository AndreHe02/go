(;B[or]C[I do not usually play the chinese fuseki myself, but I think this move is too passive. The variation (S2 instead of P2) looks better.]
;W[rr];B[rs];W[sq];B[fq];W[iq]C[This pincer looks like an overplay.]

(;B[kq]C[Is F5 better ?
CG: I think so! You should not try to use your thickness to enclose some 10 points. White's group in the lower right has still a week point at R6, so you should try to shut J3 in (see variation).]
;W[dn]C[This is a clever move - now F5 would be answered by J5. I don't see how you could attack J3 now.]

(;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[nc]C[This is a mistake! White should play O18 instead.]

(;B[me];W[ok]LB[pj:A]C[The boushi is good in situations where black has support on both sides. Here, the shoulder hit at A would be much better.]

(;B[pm]C[I think I made a mistake : Q11 or Q9 is better, isn't it ?

Yes, it is.]
(;W[qj]C[This is an overplay since the ladder is good for black.]
;B[pj];W[pk];B[ql];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[ni];B[nk]C[Seeing this result, Q7 turned out to be better than Q11. But this is only due to white's overplay at R10.]

CG: Well, there is not much choice here. The was white J15, which you should have played yourself.]

C[I didn't saw that. I decided to save the 4 stones on the side otherwise white would have made a big territory

CG: White could have played here earlier. Your pushing from behind was actually a very bad way to answer, P6 would have been much better!]
