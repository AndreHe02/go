C[Hello, my name is Terence and I'm doing the review for you. I'll put tmcs: before each comment.
And if you have any more questions just e-mail me. Feel free to send me another game to review now and again (one at a time, hehe)]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[qd];B[nq];W[np]C[tmcs: see the variation, its a common joseki and remember, attach - hane (turn the corner)]

(;B[pj];W[ol];B[qk];W[pk];B[rk];W[rl];B[ok]C[How has the opening been so far?

tmcs: well to be honest I dont think you should worry about the opening too much, the main thing is to learn to fight and make your groups safe. As you improve the opening will become more important but for now practice is the best thing]
;W[pl]C[tmcs: R10 was important, you need to make sure weak groups like this are safe]

(;B[nk]
(;W[nn];B[mm];W[nm];B[nl]C[At this time I was quite happy with the game so far, since W is sealed in the LR corner. Correct? At which time of the game and how could have an attack / invasion into this group have worked?

tmcs: this group is far too secure to invade and any attack would not have been successful. But at this point the game is going ok for you]

(;B[fn];W[jq];B[hq]C[I tried to prevent W from connecting F3 group with K3, but H3 got some pressure then. Was this an okay move or a bad one?

tmcs: basically F6 was the bad move, K3 gives white a strong group and an invasion like this is not the best thing when white has a wall of three stones]
;W[hp]
(;B[ip];W[iq];B[gp];W[ho]C[tmcs: allowing white to cut isnt the right choice]
;B[go];W[eo];B[hn];W[io];B[jp];W[jo];B[kp];W[jm]C[tmcs: white made a huge mistake by not playing G3, so you should have capitalised and played there instead!!!]
;B[jj]C[Should've I made the solid connection at G3 instead? Globally K10 seemed to be much bigger for me.]

;W[lg];B[jg]C[tmcs: you said earlier that K10 was the best move globally but territory in the middle is very difficult to defend, and white invaded esaily and probably could have done much more damage. Also, imagine if you had cut at G3, the bottom of the board would be yours and worth more than the territory you gained in the middle.]

;W[na]
(;B[om]C[Attacking isn't my thing I guess. Are there better ways to take away some of W territory?

tmcs: have a look at the series of endgame moves I have in the variation - each one is sente and you reduce whites territory with each one. In the endgame, its hard to find moves worth big points, just play simple sente endgame and you could gain 20 points.]
