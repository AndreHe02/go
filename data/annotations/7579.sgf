C[MR: I commented the game until move 66. The rest is more or less endgame.
All my comments start wit "MR:".
I commented most of the variations you clicked in until move 66, although it would have been helpful if you would not only have clicked in the variations but also commented on your opinion or clarified your questions.

Please also find a summarizing comment at move 66.];B[pd];W[qp]
;B[dc];W[cp];B[jq];W[de];B[ee];W[ef]C[one of the possible 'joseki' variation...
(LL)
MR: Yes, and it does fit well with C4 ... 
(and it is a simple joseki and especially useful if one does not know the joseki variations starting with WC17 instead of W E14)]
;B[ed];W[dg];B[jd];W[gf]C[MR: Alternatively,  white can tenuki the top left and play e.g. H17 or R14.]
;B[oq]C[MR: I don't think that this is the important direction for black.]

(;W[eq]C[MR: The joseki normally continues with an extension at the right edge. Without the extension, black can force and build up territory on the right side.]

;B[el];W[en]C[MR: It is important who comes out of the fight first to play at the right side (W R14). So white should look for an opportunity to tenuki. It is, of course, fine to take territory as long as black answers ...]
;B[gk];W[hi];B[gn]LB[qj:B][hq:A]C[MR: B G6 is off topic. Black should play around R10.]

;W[mg];B[rn]LB[qj:B][ro:A]C[MR: Strange, because black did not answer Q3, so white has no problem in the corner anyway.]
(;W[ro]LB[qn:B][gp:A]C[MR: In my opinion, white should play P2 to follow up black's tenuki to Q3.]
(;B[gp]C[MR: ? The right edge is not played out yet with black stones missing at R6 and Q10.]
;W[gq];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip]LB[kg:H][mi:A][qj:E][qk:D][pm:C][nn:B]
[no:F][jp:G]C[many possibilities... but where is the good direction ???
(LL)
MR: Black has more territory than white (black has the upper left and right, white only the lower left as "large" territories). Therefore, white has to do "something". Maybe punishing the ponnuki at the right side with W E is the most obvious idea.]
(;W[mi]C[MR: White is hopping again on non-territory ground.]
;B[ij]C[MR: Black should fix the right side instead. White has C17 to stabilize the white group.]
(;W[mk]C[MR: ?];B[lj];W[mj];B[lh];W[mh];B[kf];W[pj]LB[ol:B]
[om:A]C[MR: Wrong spot. R10 is the correct spot in this area. 
(It does not make sense to evaluate many possibilities *after* one has missed the correct spot, so I leave out commenting on the variations you clicked here)]
(;B[om];W[nn]LB[nm:A][on:B]
(;B[nm]LB[mm:C][mn:B][on:A]
(;W[on]C[MR: What is going on here? You are supposed to take advantage of the weak black stones, but you are playing as if *you* were the one with the weak stones ... This move is only bearable if you plan to cut Q7 etc. after this. But this is not so easy here because black has S10 left.]
;B[mm]LB[ph:A][pm:B]
(;W[ph];B[ok];W[pg]C[MR: Again helping black more than white.]
;B[qf];W[oe]C[MR: ? Black is getting all the large moves while white is struggling for "sure live" with his non-territory groups ...

The rest of the game is "end game", so I stop commenting here.

The main point in the game is, in my opinion, that white spend too many moves hopping on non-territory area trying to secure his groups without making many points.
You missed quite a number of follow-up moves for life, like P2 at the bottom, C17 at the top left, K17 at the top. 
My feeling is also, that you see the weaknesses of your own groups while you miss to see similar weaknesses of your opponents groups.

My suggestion would be that you start to look for moves that secure your own groups while at the same time doing something else as well, like robbing the eye space of your opponents groups or separating non-living opponent groups. You should have very good reasons when playing a move that is just connecting or just living (e.g. like P15 here)!]
