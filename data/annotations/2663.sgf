C[My opponent (Black) played a fairly cautious game, I thought, yet he beat me soundly. I lost groups at the end that might have been saved if I had read the situation better and sooner. Lessons learned there, certainly. But even had I held onto my groups, I would still have lost, because he got much the better of me in the initial 50 moves or so. Where were the critical mis-steps?

samtregar: Hello.  My name is Sam Tregar and I'll be reviewing your game.  I play on KGS as samtregar at 10k and at the New York Go Center at 5k.   Please feel free to contact me by email (sam@tregar.com) or on KGS if you have any questions about my review.   I've commented moves that I think are particularly good or bad.  At the end of the game I try to sumarize the biggest issues of the game.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[ep];W[eq]LB[cm:A][dn:B]C[st: this is an unusual response.  By attaching to black's approach you are asking him to get stronger.  I think a better move would be A or B.]
;B[fq];W[dq];B[fp]C[st: Which looks better now, white or black?  I'd rather be black because I've got the start of a wall facing my stone at Q4.  This looks like the start of some nice lower territory.  On the other hand, white has only secured his corner and has little influence.]
;W[cn]LB[nc:A][qj:B][cm:D][kq:C]C[st: too small.  On the third line a 2 stone extension is standard (like D).  However, you didn't need another stone in this corner.  I think it would be better to play elsewhere.  A, B or C perhaps.]
;B[jp]C[st: big move by black.  He's building a framework on the bottom.  You have to stop him if you want to win.]
;W[qf]LB[np:B][nq:A]C[st: I think A or B is imperitive now.]
;B[pf]C[st: black repeats your mistake by attaching.];W[pg]
;B[qe];W[of];B[pe];W[og];B[md];W[rg]LB[rf:A][qg:B]C[Was this White move necessary? Appropriate?

st: I don't like it.  They call the second line the "losing line" because playing there early in the game is like giving away points.  Also, it hands black a forcing move at S14 and leaves open a peep at R12.  If you really wanted to build a wall I think A would have been better, or possibly B for a very strong connection.  Neither seems urgent though.]
;B[jd]LB[fc:A]C[st: this looks a little small to me.  I would have gone all the way to A or played somewhere else.]
;W[pl]LB[qn:A][nq:B]C[st: I like the direction, but I think you need to go further.  That black stone at Q4 is pretty weak - the nearest friendly stone is halfway across the board.  Attack!  I think A would be good, or maybe B for a bigger fight.  Somehow you have to invade the lower side.]
;B[ci]C[st: good move.  D16 looks very weak now.];W[cf]C[st: appropriate response, I think.]
;B[cl];W[nq]C[I played this corner very badly and ultimately lost everything I had invested here. Where were my most critical errors?]
;B[lq];W[pq]LB[qn:B][no:A][qq:C]C[st: this is the big mistake.  By attaching to black's very weak stone you make it stronger.  Instead, A or B is the next move I would make.  Even C is much better, although I think it would end up giving black too much influence.]
;B[qp]C[st: black takes your invitation and gets strong.];W[qq]
;B[op]
(;W[mp]LB[oq:A]C[st: another very poor move.  Black is threatening to invade the corner at P3.  I think you must answer at A or you'll have a hard time making life.  See the variation for how I think this would work out.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[pr];B[mr];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[nn];W[qo]
;B[qn];W[rn];B[po];W[rm];B[nl];W[ok]LB[so:A]C[Should I have gone to G16 myself at this juncture, instead?

st: this is definitely a weak move.  It's very small and I can't see what it accomplishes for you aside from a couple points.  Plus, A is crying for attention!  After black plays there you'll have a hard time living in the corner.  G16 isn't bad, but A is required!]
;B[gc];W[dc]C[st: good move];B[jl]C[st: This is huge.  Black is using the influence from his lower group to take control of the center.]
;W[en]C[st: too little, too late.];B[gn];W[mf];B[ei];W[mj];B[lk]
C[st: black's bottom territory is now huge.  The game is very hard for white to win now, I think.]
;W[fl];B[bg];W[bf];B[ge];W[fg];B[bm];W[bn];B[eb];W[db];B[fb]
;W[qc]LB[kc:B][lc:A]C[I gave up quickly on this corner. Perhaps too quickly. Could I have taken it? I did, at least, reduce his territory considerably along the top edge.

st: I don't think so, but I'm not sure.  I think something like A or B might be possible since his stones are so high, but with the G17 group it seems unlikely.]
;B[pb];W[nc];B[pc];W[ld]LB[nd:A]C[st: I think A now would have been better.]
;B[mc];W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[mb];W[oe];B[nb];W[kc];B[jc];W[jf]
;B[af]C[Black closes three edges to his advantage at this point, while retaining sente. Should I have made these plays myself before him?

st: if possible, yes.  Black has decided it is time for endgame, but I think he's a little early.  You probably cuold ignore one or more of these and make a bigger move elsewhere.]
;W[ae];B[ag];W[bd];B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[cb];B[an];W[ao];B[am]
;W[bo];B[kb];W[hl]LB[fd:A][ki:C][kj:B]C[st: good.  Black's last move did not deserve a reply.  However, mabye A, B or C would have been better?]

;B[sg];W[sh];B[sf];W[rh];B[fr];W[er];B[so]C[st: ouch!  It would have been good for white to get here first!  I'm not sure this kills the corner but it definitely puts it in danger.]

;W[lc];B[lb];W[le];B[os];W[ps];B[ns]LB[rr:B][sr:A][rs:C]C[st: you should know this shape from life and death puzzles.  Whoever plays inside first wins.  You should play A or B now.  C lives too, I think.]
;W[sn]C[st: terrible move.  This gives away the corner for nothing.]
;B[qo];W[rl];B[om]LB[sr:A]C[st: a second chance!  A now!];W[do]
;B[gm];W[ij];B[gl];W[hk];B[rr]C[Ouch. I guess I failed to read this carefully enough. Thought it was safe.

st: it's hard to read this kind of shape under presure.  You should practice life and death puzzles and then you will recognize this shape.]
;W[sr];B[rs]C[st: black gives you a point.  I guess he doesn't know this shape either...]
;W[ol];B[ss]C[st: Amazing.  He played well up to now, but he's just giving away points by playing here.]
;W[fm];B[sq];W[fh];B[gi];W[fc];B[qs];W[ec];B[qr];W[gb]C[I get a small measure of revenge.

st: yes indeed.  I don't know what happened to black...];B[hb]

;W[ch];B[ej];W[dm];B[dp]LB[cq:A]C[st: uh oh.  C3 looks like trouble.  You must patch it now.  When your opponent plays next to an open diagonal like this always think about whether you need to answer or not.]
;W[fj];B[bi];W[hj];B[cq]C[This was more painful. No way to save the group now, as far as I can see.

st: well, the bottom part is certainly dead.  I think you can save the top.  See my variation.]

(;W[cr];B[bq];W[bp];B[br];W[ds];B[bs]C[Resignation.

st: Overall I see two major areas where you should focus your study: the opening and life and death.  Studying the opening will help you avoid the problems you had on the bottom in this game where black built a huge framework while you played small moves elsewhere.  Life and death will help you avoid what happened in the two lower corners where your territory wasn't as secure as you thought it was.  I hope my comments have been helpful.  Please contact me with any questions.]
