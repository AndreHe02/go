C[Hi,
This game was part of the 2009 Irish Championship and was played on KGS.
I am black  and 2kyu, my opponent is 1 dan.
I was actually relatively happy with how I played in this game despite losing by over 20 points.
I think the reason I lost by so much was because I played too cautiously and didn't invade enough.]

(;B[dp]LB[qk:A][ql:B]C[Not playing corners first, white was willing to build a mini-chinese, or micro-chinese opening, that is, playing at A or B. I think black should take the big point at A]
;W[qk]C[You are right, you can't let white get a double-winged framework and you should prevent it immediatly to avoid issues. One possible move is to take the big point at bottom.]

(;B[dd];W[fq]
(;B[dn]C[Very peaceful. From here, black must keep one saying in mind " Slow and steady wins the race". This is likely to be a battle of influence and shared borders.]
;W[jp];B[cj];W[jj]C[I wasn't sure how to deal with this moyo. If i try invading the bottom right corner I didn't think I'd be able to live locally and running towards the center is tough with k10.
I decided to take some big points and worry about reducing the moyo later

Taking some big points is a good idea and consistent with your peaceful and patient strategy. Rushing into white's area can't turn out good, as you will be at a disadvantage when fights start.

Theoretically, there are 2 ways of dealing with a moyo :

1: Chase one of your opponent's group and drive yourself into his area. Points will disappear / be made as you will be chasing it.
2: When the opponent doesn't have any weak groups, you must ask yourself " where are my opponent's enlarging moves ? Where are mine ?" It's usually the same spots for both.]

(;B[ee]C[White is enclosed in the corner so I was quite happy with this result.

E15 is not correct, there might be a ladder involved eventually.]
;W[po]LB[of:C][fo:A][go:B]TR[rd][dr]C[All big points are now taken. As white doesn't have any weak groups, you will have to play patiently and erode step by step by taking mutual big points. 

A, B and C are the big points. They can both enlarge either black or white's potential and turn it into territory. Black is sente, he can get them all.

Playing the triangle spots surely is worth quite a lot of points but white is likely to jump at A and C if black plays too territorially-oriented.]

(;B[mj];W[of];B[mf];W[ck]C[I thought this move was small.

It is not so small as it costs you many points on the side but it looks really bad timing indeed, and you are right to ignore it.]
;B[mh];W[id]C[I found this move hard to answer because of the e16 aji.

>> E15 is to blame ;)

I decided to kill e16 and clear up all of the aji but it felt too slow

I often hear from friends : " But isn't that bad for black, not to block at D10 ?"

 It's actually a terrible result for white. Why ?

Because white is not safe yet, and black is very solid and strong everywhere, there is a mutual damage, that's right, but black will gain more out of it as he can chase or block or attack freely anywhere he wants to unlike white who can only defend as he is neither solid nor safe.]
