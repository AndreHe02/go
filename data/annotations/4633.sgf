(;W[ic]C[Is this extension too far?  Just right?  Not far enough?
-I guess you did this worried about black h17? At this stage it is a bit too small, something around N17 would be nice, extend your corner off the q16 stone as well as extending side. It does leave alot of space for invasion but you can use that to your advantage.]

-Both have potential, just remember don't be afraid to give your opponent potential because potential isn't yet cash ^_~]
;B[np]C[What is the best way to respond to this?  It reminded me of an attach-and-extend type joseki, so that's sort of what I went after.]

Also, is my white stone at R12 too far out?

-I think he was worried about you using your center oriented influence to attack his middle group, also that you could make territory in center. All of black's groups are settled so he can afford to do this]

(;W[qi]C[At this point, I knew the block of territory around P8 and P9 was going to be a decent piece for black.  Not sure how to get in there, if at all.  Maybe a stone around O9, allowing me to extend both ways around N10, then maybe use an atari to escape?  I messed around with some variations, but none of them seemed to allow me to escape, so maybe that's a bad move.  Ideas?
-See variations];B[pj]
(;W[rh];B[oh]C[Oops.  P12 is way more important for me than S12.  I think this move is one (probably of many) that I can pinpoint as losing me this game.  P12 seems to be worth 10 or 12 points to me, considering how this played out.  I got rattled by Black P12 and then sort of crumbled into a mess.]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[si];B[of]C[Strangely, even though I knew at the time that P12 was a good move for Black, one that I had missed, I then continued with my line of attack on the bottom and ended up missing out on P14 too.  Two blown moves.]

;B[tt]C[Overall, I can see a couple moves in the upper right (P12 and P14) that cost me a lot of points, the error on row 19 that cost me some, and potentially the ko and capture on the left side near the end, which would've won me the game.

I felt like I played pretty consistently, although lately I've been feeling like I'm not being aggressive enough, just walking along with the other player who cheerfully carves out his territory.

This game, I tried to pay a little more attention to maintaining sente, but still missed the mark horribly in some cases.

I'm not sure specifically what kind of comments I'm looking for.  I guess, if you agree, confirmation on the errors I pointed out, some help in the opening, and maybe how you would've reacted to black dropping a few stones in the middle.  Whatever you think would be helpful, ultimately.

Thanks!

Todd

-Right well i think i covered the key points as they happened. As for what i would do about the middle stones?.. I think i would of tried to put pressure on them and make some territory in the process. How exactly i can't really say but its clear black was worried about the center so you could of used that. letting black get in P12 and p14 lost you the game i think. I know what its like to miss something so big and you would think would be so obvious, even high dan players will do it so don't worry too much about it ^_^
Hope my comments help you out and good luck with future games!]
