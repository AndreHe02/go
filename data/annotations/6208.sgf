C[~ Hi, I'm Kim Salamony (aka phantom).  I'll be reviewing this game for black (jfc).

To best view this review, follow the main path and move to the variations only when instructed to do so.  I begin all of my comments with a ~ to make them easy to identify.  Be sure to check the last move for my final comments.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via email (gophantom@gmail.com).

I notice that this game was played with only 10 min. absolute time, which seems a little fast for well thought out moves.  I will point out some general mistakes, but I will not go into many long variations because it doesn't seem useful to go much deeper than the opponents read during the game.  In the future, I suggest submitting, slower, more serious games for review.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[cp]C[~ This move isn't bad, and pros do play it at times, but it's a poor choice of direction.  Notice how black gets to approach from the side where he has a stone in the other corner.  This helps him make his stones work together.  So, if you want to play a 3-4, it's better to play D3.]
;B[ep];W[eo]C[~ This move is part of a joseki, but it's a strange choice here.  It will allow black to build influence on the bottom while white builds influence on the right.  But, that doesn't seem like a good trade.]
;B[fo];W[do];B[fp]
(;W[dj]LB[dj:A][dq:B]C[~ While the extension at A works well with your wall, playing at B would work better.  If white plays there, he can make some territory while making black's 3 stones are a little less stable.  But, if black gets a move in that area he can gain stability and take a lot of territory. (See variation.)]

;B[qn];W[ri];B[rh];W[jd];B[pf]
(;W[nf]LB[nf:A][jo:B]C[I thought about playing at k5.  Would that have been better?

~ That's a hard question to answer.  Let's start by looking at the merits of A, the move you played...

This move is pretty useful because it closes black in somewhat.  This area is pretty important to both sides.  For white, it helps strengthen his stones and increase his moyo.  On the other hand, if black made it into first, it would help him push out into the center while threatening white's stones along the top a bit.  So, A seems like a pretty good move.  (See variation for some thoughts on B.)]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[bd];W[be]
;B[bc];W[cf];B[pb];W[og]C[~ This is a strange move.  It doesn't do much to help you out.  It looks like you might be trying to connect your groups or lock black in.  But, black can still split and get out at Q11 if he wants, so it doesn't accomplish either goal.]
;B[pg]
(;W[fn]LB[fn:A][on:B][jo:C]C[woukd p6 have been better?  or k5?

~ This move isn't bad.  It's a big point for both sides.  Something around P6 would also be a good idea though.  (See variation for more on it.)  For K5, see what I said the last time you suggested it move 26.  This part of the board hasn't changed much since then, so it still applies.]
;B[on];W[pm];B[pn];W[oi];B[jn];W[ho]C[~ This move invites trouble.  Imagine what would happen if black played at H6.  You'd have a mess to deal with.  Black could make a lot of trouble in the center of the board.]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[hq];W[io];B[jo];W[im];B[gp];W[jm];B[in];W[hn]
;B[km];W[kl];B[lm];W[ll]C[~ This situation worked out very well for white.  The center is huge, and it should be difficult for black to do much damage to it.]
;B[dh]
(;W[eh]LB[eh:A][ci:B]C[~ There is a proverb that says "Don't attach to weak stones."  By making contact with the invading stone here, you give it a chance to get stronger.  Your opponent is desperate to keep you from getting large center here.  But, if you deal with the invasion calmly, you should be fine.  Consider B instead of A here.  (See variation.)]
;B[di];W[ei];B[cj];W[ck];B[dk];W[ej]C[~ Notice how your opponent gets to push you around because his stones are in contact with yours.  This gives him a lot of control over the fight and a better chance of winning it.]
;B[bk];W[cl];B[bi];W[ch];B[cg];W[dg];B[ci];W[bg];B[bl];W[bm]
;B[bh]
(;W[aj]C[It seemed like I could kill this group.  Is this right?  Where should I have played differently

~ If there is a way to kill with your strategy of making contact and pushing him against the edge of the board, I don't see it.  Your best chance to kill would have been keeping him away from the wall.  Honestly though, you don't need to kill at this point.  Protecting at C7 and forcing him to play A10 to save himself works fine.  (See variation.)

Unfortunately, trying to steal this eye is a disaster.  The weakness at C7 is just too much to handle.]
;B[cm];W[dl];B[bn];W[cn];B[am];W[dm];B[bj]
(;W[ah]C[I should have taken at b7?  To make a ko for he group?

~ The ko here is difficult to read.  So, it's hard for me to comment on.  But, from what I can tell, black has an advantage because white will be the first to need to find a threat.  Black also seems to have more threats on the board, so it does not look like a ko white can win.]
;B[bm];W[bo];B[ak];W[gb]C[~ If you're going to try locking up the top of the board, start with the other side of the board around O18.  Black can do much more damage with a move over there.]
;B[ai];W[oc];B[pc];W[ob];B[ih];W[kh]C[I wasn't sure if I should attach or not.  I thought to "drive him towards my thick wall along the left side.

~ This is exactly the right idea!  Remember, don't attach to weak stones.  With that wall, you should be able to kill him.]
;B[if]
(;W[ie]LB[ie:A][kf:B]C[~ Oh no, you attached!

Consider L14 instead.  Remember, all you need to do is to make sure he doesn't have room for eyes.  You might not even need to capture the stones, so reducing eye space is more important than reducing liberties.  (See variation.)]
;B[gg];W[fg]LB[gf:C][hf:B][jf:D][fg:A]C[what about a play at h13 here? or g12?

~ Those wouldn't work much better than the move you played.  What you really need to do is limit the space he has to maneuver in.  It's getting harder and harder to kill him now.  But, you still might pull it off with a move at D.]
;B[gf];W[ff];B[gh];W[jg]LB[jf:B][jg:A]C[~ This peep gives you a lot of trouble.  When you're in a close fighting situation like this, there are often good responses to peeps other than connecting.  Try not to overlook them when reading.]
;B[he];W[hd]C[better at k14?

~ It's hard to say for sure, but possibly.  Black doesn't have much room for making eyes along the bottom.  But, if he pushes through at K14, you're in trouble.  So, protecting there seems like a good idea.]
;B[je];W[id];B[jf];W[ge];B[ig];W[hj]C[h11 better? or l14?

~ Something in the neighborhood of L14 might work.  Personally, I might try M15.]
;B[kg];W[jh];B[lg];W[lh]C[m15?

~ Yes, that seems to give you a good chance.];B[le];W[ke]C[h11 better?

~ Almost anything is better than this.  Here you give him an easy eye.  The question is whether or not there's still a way for him to make two eyes with a move around L16.  It could be a tough fight if you play H11 and let him play there.  It might be best to take L16 yourself.]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[ld];W[lc];B[hi];W[ii];B[gi];W[gj];B[hf];W[mg]
;B[lf];W[md]C[~ Now that everything is settled, end game is starting and black has a bit of a lead.  You could still win it if you play better end game than him.  But, this move is only worth a couple points so it doesn't help much.  Look for big moves and moves where you keep sente (the initiative).  For an example, see black's next move.]
;B[sm]C[~ If you'd played T6 before he played T7, it could swing the game by 4 points.  Grabbing moves like this first can make a big difference in end game, so start looking for them once you see that all the groups are settled.]
;W[sl];B[sn];W[rk];B[om]C[~ Pushing here is very big for black.  It seems big enough to secure the game for him.]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[nk]
(;B[ml]C[~ It was nice of black to let you close him in here.  O9 would have really hurt.  (See variation.)]
;W[mk];B[mn];W[qq]C[~ This invasion is rather unreasonable and really shouldn't work, but if you honestly thing you have a chance here, it's worth a try.  You're behind and a successful invasion could fix that.]
;B[pr];W[pq];B[oq];W[qr];B[or]
(;W[qp]C[s4 better?

~ No, S4 doesn't seem to work either.  Like I said, you really shouldn't be able to live here.  (See variation.)]
;B[sr];W[rr];B[sp];W[rp];B[so]C[~ This is a mistake by black.  If he had played T3, there would be no way to get a ko.]
;W[sq];B[rq];W[db];B[da];W[sq];B[gn];W[gm];B[rq];W[fa];B[cb]
;W[sq];B[go];W[hm];B[rq];W[ea]C[I thought this would kill his group if I played at d18.

~ Understandable.];B[sq];W[db];B[ba];W[ca];B[ab];W[cr];B[dr]
;W[cs];B[ds];W[ar];B[dp];W[op];B[po]C[I was really grasping at staws here.

~ This is really unreasonable.  In a situation like this, if you think you see something, you can try it.  Otherwise, it can be rude to try unreasonable things hoping for mistakes.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[nn];B[mp];W[mo];B[lo];W[lp];B[mq];W[lq];B[no]
;W[kp]C[~ At this point, do you still think there's some chance of doing damage here?  If black ignores to take a point or two elsewhere, you will just fall farther behind.  (See variation.)]

(;B[jp];W[rf];B[rd];W[qe];B[pe];W[qd]C[better at t12?

~ Yes, this is another situation where you're being a little unreasonable.  It doesn't seem possible to stop black from making two eyes, so your best moves are just to reduce the size of the group.]
;B[qc];W[re];B[rc];W[qg];B[rg];W[sh];B[sg];W[ph];B[qf];W[qi]
;B[qg];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa]C[~ Notice that if R17 wasn't in place, black would need another move to protect R19.  So, by trying to kill when you couldn't, you lost the initiative.]
;B[rb]C[~ Okay, maybe you didn't lose it since black was a little paranoid.  :)]
;W[jj]C[~ Ask yourself if you really need a move like this before playing it.  Just like when you play threatening, unreasonable moves that aren't really threats, you lose points by being over protective like this.]
;B[cg];W[ra];B[sa];W[ch];B[ae];W[af];B[ad];W[fi];B[ag];W[nm]
;B[mm];W[ah];B[da];W[jr];B[ir];W[ca];B[kr];W[js]C[~ Just because black was silly enough to think he needed another move down here, does not mean there's anything for you to gain by playing another move.  In fact, at this point, he could get away with ignoring your move again.]
;B[is];W[lr];B[ks];W[da];B[ag];W[gq];B[gr];W[ah];B[fq];W[ag]
C[better at c13?

~ Yes, the ko there is much heavier, and you've wasted all of your threats.]
;B[od];W[nc];B[me];W[ne];B[kf];W[mf]C[~ This move doesn't accomplish anything.  It would be better to play something like C13 now.]

[ss]C[~ The two things you really need to work on are handling invasions and reading out potential weaknesses at the end of the game.

When your opponent invades, avoid contact moves.  Concentrate on confining his group and keeping it small and eyeless.  Remember that it's often better to keep a group small than to go all out trying to kill it and fail.

If you read more carefully at the end of the game, you can get much stronger.  Every time you protect needlessly, you lose at least a point, as you do every time you play a threat that doesn't work if your opponent ignores it.  That could be worth 10 or more points in every game.  So, it's well worth working on.

Good luck in your future games and on improving!])
(;B[ag]C[~ This might not be the biggest move for black, but it's ignorable, so we'll use it for our example.]
;W[jp]C[~ This is what you seemed to be threatening.];B[iq]
;W[ko]C[Now what? Maybe another sente move?];B[kn]C[~ Now it looks like you're completely out of moves again.  Try to at least read ahead a move or two to make sure you can do damage if you're opponent ignores you before trying moves that look unreasonable.]

))
(;W[bm]C[~ White begins by taking the ko.];B[bo]C[~ Black can start out by making a local threat here.]
;W[bp];B[cm]LB[ak:B][ao:A]C[~ This is where things start to get complicated.  It should be clear that if black gets to fill the ko, A and B will be miai for life (meaning if white plays one, black can live by playing the other).  So, white can use one now as a local threat.

Unfortunately, it is unclear to me which, if either is better.  They seem similar, but A seems easier to explain, so that's the one I'll explore.  I encourage you to explore B on your own if you're currious.]
;W[ao];B[ak];W[bm];B[ag]LB[af:A][cm:B]C[~ This is another spot where things get more complicated.  Black threatens to start a different ko here.  White can either respond at A or fill and switch to this ko.  (See the variations for both paths.)]

(;W[af];B[cm]C[~ Now white needs to find the first threat.]
)
(;W[cm];B[ae];W[af];B[bf]C[~ White will need to find the first threat here too.]
)))
(;W[cm];B[aj]LB[nb:A][nl:B]C[~ Now black is alive, but it's your turn and you can lock up enough of the center, the game is yours.

There are big moves for either player around A and B.  These are the holes in white's territory.  You'll have to pick on to block and work on reducing the damage if your opponent takes the other.  If you do that well enough, black's successful invasion will be fine.]
))
(;W[ci]C[~ The idea of this move is to take away eye space and keep black away from the wall.  That will make it more difficult for him to live since walls are the easiest places to find eyes.  At the same time, you are turning the right side into solid territory, which is a nice bonus.]
;B[fh];W[fj]C[~ The fight might go something like this.  Your goal should be to limit the space he has for making eyes.  You have a strong wall on the top, so try to work with that.  If you push him towards it, he won't have anywhere to run.]
))
(;W[on]C[~ A move like this near your small group on the right seems like a good idea.  Of all your groups on the board, that group is the weakest and needs the most help.  So, a move like this that helps a weak group is very useful.]
))
(;W[jo]TR[jd][qm][eo]C[~ This cap is a common sort of reducing move.  It encourages black to turn the bottom into territory in exchange for limiting how far into the center he can get.  It's not a bad idea, I'm not sure it's the best idea right now.

Furthermore, this could be a difficult stone to work with.  Usually, when you plan a cap, you want the option of lightly backing off and working with your other stones.  So, take a look at the other stones that you might want to work with this one, E5, K16, and R7 (all marked with triangles).  Notice that you can't easily work with E5 because there is a black stone in the way.  Meanwhile, R7 is two lines higher and halfway across the board.  Finally, K16 is all the way on the other side of the board.  If the other two stones were more accessible, the distance of K16 wouldn't really be a problem.  But, as it is K5 just seems lonely.

So, I'd say your original move was better.]))
(;W[dq]C[~ Now white has the corner and black seems to be floating.  It's hard to find a good follow up for black now.  But, it should be easy to see that he can't do much to threaten white and he can't build much out of his three stones on the right.]
