C[Hi! My name is Godwin, and I took a look at some reviews from the Go Teaching Ladder, and I was wondering if I could apply it to my games, and well... I think I have some difficulty on my fuseki and decisions at critical moments in this game. I was hoping to get some Go advice and another perspective on the effectiveness of some of my moves. Thank You for spending your time to review my game.

Jan-Willem Swane (JWS): Let's have a look. I will not analyze the whole game, but I will try to give you some advice to better your game at this moment.]
;B[dp];W[qd];B[dd];W[pp];B[dj];W[qj]TR[pj]C[This was probably a bit slow, but I thought (according to my friend's advice) that in Go, when you defend, you also create territory while attacking your opponent's invasion.

JWS: I don't think playing at the right side is wrong. It's a matter of taste if you attack black, or play 'at your own side'.

But I do think you play too low here. I would have liked a play at the triangle better, because it works better with the low R16.]
;B[oc];W[pf];B[ne]TR[lc]C[JWS: the normal move would be around the triangle. Black leaves a lot of room for an invasion.]

(;W[fc]TR[ic]C[Here, I thought that after responding to my F17 move, I would have the opportunity to pressure his P17&O15 group.

JWS: Here you could think about J17 (or J18). The nice thing is that you can expand fromt that spot with a two space jump to either side.

See the variations.];B[hd]C[This kind of ended my plans, but I was also wondering if there is a better joseki for this part of the game.

JWS: You gave black the possibility to play a two purpose move: an expansion from P17/O15 and a pincher.]
;W[cc]C[JWS: Jumping in the corner is not good: it gives black the opportunity to build a wall. That is not good when he has a stone around D10.

I would have tried to jump to F15. It can give you strength which can help you later to invade  around k16 and start a fight.]
;B[cd]C[JWS: now black can build a wall that works perfectly with D10.]
;W[dc];B[dg]C[JWS: a bad move. It should have been at E16.]

(;W[fq]C[JWS: you should have taken the opportunity that black has given you. See variation.]
;B[hp];W[cq]C[JWS: again, you are helping black building a wall.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[dm];W[fo]C[I know that this is probably dangerous and an overextension, but black had too much of an influence, M3 would probably be an area with bigger points, but I didn't exactly know how to approach this situation.

JWS: your idea to jump out is a good one. Black's D7 should have been at E4.]
;B[fn]C[JWS: one important rule of the thumb is that you don't 'touch' the opponents stone when you are stronger in an arrea. The fight that will occur will make both players stronger, and the weakest stones will profit the most.]
;W[eo];B[en]
(;W[do];B[co];W[go];B[lp]C[JWS: this looks good for you. Blacks stones are on the fourth line, therefore they don't have a base. When you chase them, he will run to the center and you can make territory while doing that.]
;W[nq];B[mq];W[pm]C[JWS: Answering wiht O4 would have been better. It puts a lot of pressure on black and it gives you a strong corner.]
;B[jj]
(;W[lj]C[JWS: here you are starting to lose it. Black has a weak group at the bottom and you can win a lot by harrassing it.

Black plays a move in the center. By answering two spaces right from it, you are 'claiming'  less territory than he is doing. If you continue doing that, he will win easily.]
;B[ki]C[JWS: you have invited black to ad a stone, and instead of an isolated stone in the middle, he is getting a group.]
;W[li];B[fd];W[fb]C[JWS: too submisive. G17 would have been a lot better.]
;B[lg];W[nh]C[JWS: You are giving in to every black move. I am afraid that you have created a lost position in a few moves by giving black such a strong position in the middle, while contenting yourself with a inferior position at the right.]
;B[qc];W[pd];B[pc];W[od]TR[jc][kh][ln][hr]C[JWS: this move only strengthens at the top. You should start a fight. I have marked some spots.]
;B[nd];W[mf]TR[ke]C[JWS: you have found a weak point in his defence. The triangle spot would be the ideal place to defend. Try for yourself if you can find a way through.]
;B[me]C[JWS: and black lets you through.];W[lf];B[kf];W[le]
;B[ke];W[ld];B[kd];W[mc];B[nc];W[kc]C[JWS: this side is not so interesting, because black can never make a lot of territory here. If he closes it wiht L17, you can jump in from your F17 stones. Playing at S17 is a lot bigger.]
;B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[pe]C[JWS: ugly, because it is a double empty triangle. R14 would have been a lot stronger.]
;B[rf]C[JWS: with a white stone at R14 this would have been senseless.]
;W[se];B[mg];W[nf];B[ng];W[og];B[mh];W[ni];B[mi];W[mj];B[kh]
;W[lh]C[I think in my series of forced moves I could probably have done something better or have forced the moves toward the endgame, but perhaps I didn't know which direction to go too well at this stage, and I wanted to clear the board up a bit.

JWS: you should have left this move as a ko threath.

Your only hope would be conquering the bottom black stones. First you should play around K8. While blacks defends his center territory, you are isolating the bottom stones. Then you could start a fight at the bottom.]
;B[kg];W[mm]C[JWS: in this way, you are inviting the bottom group to strengthen itself and even to connect to the other stones.]
;B[no];W[oo];B[nn];W[ol];B[nm];W[nl];B[on];W[pn];B[op];W[oq]
;B[qq];W[qp]C[would there have been a way to kill this group?

JWS: I am afraid not, but maybe I miss something.

I will end my review here. In the end you regain a lot; you play the endgame well. 

You do have a lost postion here because of two reasons:

- you have answered a lot of black moves too passively, giving him more than you get.
- you have not seen that blacks bottom group was weak, and you could have won a lot by attacking it.

Have fun with the game.
