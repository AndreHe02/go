AB[pd][dp]C[This is Xiangqi, I'm a KGS 3k. All comments are mine.

I'm a high functioning autistic person.  Doesn't mean I'm crazy but my mind works in a very strange but logical way.  I coach sports and chess so helping you figure out some things to get your win rate higher is right up my alley.

I understand you are more interested in strategy than tactics so I'll try to focus mostly on that.

Now lets see how this game went!];W[cd];B[pp];W[qn];B[np];W[qf]
;B[nc];W[pj];B[ec];W[ed];B[fd];W[ee]LB[dc:B][ge:A]C[This isn't usual but I like it.

I'll give the normal continuuation as a variation.

Your move (A) doesnt directly threaten territory but it works well with the marked stones.  I think its kind of a mistake to go for territory in the beginning of the game.  I like to make a large framework with stones in position to assist eachother in the inevitable fighting to come.  Your move is consistant with that.]

(;B[ge]TR[pd][dp][np]C[The marked stones work well together.]
;W[dc]LB[fc:A][of:B]C[hard to criticize this common sense move (A) but guess what?

That's right I'm going to!

It's imortant to be decisive in go.  By playing G-15 you told us that the center and upper side was more important than whether white gets a few extra points in the upper left corner.  now you've changed your mind and play a timid gote move in a position where many very large points are open.

here is what seems like a natrual follow-up sequence to me: (B)  but remember, I'm like the rainman just not as smart!]

;W[rd]LB[qc:A][of:B]TR[jd]C[Here is somthing concrete you can work on.

This (A) is a typical move of players around your rank and even players around mine...well ok ok even I do this sometimes.  This move feels safe and good but its really small relative to the position.

fact is white can easily split you into unstable groups on  the top side with a move someplace around the triangle and thats the biggest thing here.  

by making the move at (B) you make it difficult for a stone at the mark to connect to white's right side meaining it can come uder heavy attack and as a bonus white can't play in the area of (B) and make a moyo on the right while pusing into your own top side moyo.]

(;B[qc];W[of];B[ql];W[pl];B[pm];W[qm];B[pn];W[po]LB[pk:B][qo:A]
C[The variation at (B) shows how you could use this attack to break up the right side instead of focusing on the corner.]

(;B[qo];W[om];B[rn];W[rm];B[ro];W[fn];B[fl];W[ip];B[gp];W[hn]
C[This attack seems dangerous but you defend well.];B[ho];W[in]
C[K-5 was probably better.];B[io];W[jo];B[jp];W[ko];B[cj]TR[fg]
C[Agressive which is good. But the marked move is also agressive AND builds up your top side so it accomplishes two important things instead of one.]
;W[el];B[fm];W[dk]LB[pi:B][dj:A]
(;B[dj]TR[fg][gn]SQ[pi]C[Not a fan of this. I like the marked moves more.

The square is the variation shown on the previous move.  It takes advantage of the small remaining aji of the Q-7 stones to break up the right side.]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[dh];B[fj];W[fk]LB[ek:A][gk:B]C[You plaed the Ko at (A). I disagree. 

(B) ruins his shape and the variation given which succeeds in breaking up his right side and consolidating your own moyo on top. It leaves black far ahead and is practically forced.  Entering into this ko is kind of unpredictable and potentially bad in a winning game.]

;B[lf];W[mf];B[lg];W[mh];B[eg];W[dg]C[Winning your upper right corner and ruining your upper side moyo shows that white's ko threat you ignored was enormous.  you lost the aji that would have allowed Q-11 as well.  The ko was a total disaster even though you 'won' it.]

[ls][ms][ns]C[I don't think you were behind until white played K-11. It was a huge move that saves the win for you if you play it first.  The thing in the lower right...we're kyu players.  We often miss tesuji based on these kind of shortage of liberty ideas.  The more you get caught in things like this the easier it'll be for you to see them the next time and do it the other guy.

Strategically your biggest issue is timing.  Early in the game you played several really small goteish moves when you really should have made large tenukis that force the opponent to constantly react to what you do instead of leading you around by the nose knowing you'll reply to whatever he decides to play.  Yes you give up some points locally but so what?

Remember the image of the guy crawling around on the floor looking for a dime while you sit at the table calmly counting stacks of $100 bills.

Never be the guy on the floor!

Good luck and best wishes! You have my email if you want to discuss the game further.

In this case black will gain greatly in every area of the board from attacking this K-16 stone.  white still hasnt had time to play R-17 so black could end up with that as well.

meantime every area where white could possibly make a lot of points is either ruined or directly threatened.  Black has very solid cash on the lower side and obvious attacking moves like the ones marked.]

this is what I mean about being consistant.  We don't grovel for a few points around e17 and hand him the initiative. We smash him with a 7 rank deep moyo on the top side and the beginnings of a promising lower side moyo at the marked stones.]
