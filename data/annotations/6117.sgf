C[Dear Reviewer,

First I would like to thank you for taking the time to review this game.

In this game, I (white) have been struggling to grasp the advantage, and eventually never got it. I made some mistakes, however I feel they do not explain my loss. Therefore I would be grateful if you could tell me the reasons I got defeated, and suggest some weaknesses in my skills, that I could work on in order to progress as a go player.

I have been studying the game myself, and have included some feelings and questions in the file.

Kind regards, and thank you very much in advance.

Comments by David Artus - djna[2k\] on KGS.


An overall summary: My feeling is that by move 51 the game was very strongly in B's favour. So much so that W had no realistic winning chances after that, with correct play B should be able to close out the win. The fundamental reason was that W had invested stones in groups that had no growth potential. hence from that point on B moves tended to build increasing territory., W moves tended simply to establish a foothold somewhere and deny B some  territory, but actually only build small numbers of W points. Moves 44 and 45 mark the transition into a difficult posintion for W. 44 is defensive (and I think needed) but that allows B to play 45 and W is left with no real attack.
If the W corner group were only a fraction stronger, then W can seize the initialive.

Bottom line: if you don't build territory then you need to have something to attack. B played quite conservatively in the late middle game, I think that the winning margin could have been larger.

Big question is what went wrong for W? Because in this case I didn't really think that B played brilliant moves, nor did W make terrinble blunders (a couple of reading errors, but they didn't cause the loss).

I think the two things W should consider are:

1). Move 24. Makes a very heavy shape. Always consider whether you would like to discard stones.

2). Move 32. a cut, how many weak groups can I maintain? Is there a realistic prospect of an attack. The cut might have been good if the corner is clearly alive. So at crucial junctures like this it's essential to look ahead, not in a move-by-move sense, but just in a general, what kind of group relationshio will happen if I follow this path. Very simple rule of thumb. You can afford exactly one weak group.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[cp];W[pq]C[
djna: My preference as W is to play more rapid development. 

Two 3-4 points feels slow to me.];B[fq]SQ[cj]C[

djna: primary development direction from here is as marked ...]
;W[ce]C[

djna: so this seems good to me.];B[qo];W[po]SQ[fq]C[/L : I played this way in order to get some influence, and counter his shimari on the lower left.

djna: I'm not convinced my this plan. Thickness tends to  be neutralised by marked stone.
and B is likely to be building framwork on left side which may work well with top right.


I'd be inclined to play a pincer instead.];B[pn];W[oo];B[qp]
;W[qq];B[qk]SQ[on]C[

djna: joseki books suggest marked push]
(;W[kp]LB[iq:A][kq:B]C[

djna: a rather vague move. If we think of W as having a three stone wall, then it's probably a bit close. 

What will you do if Black plays A?  Defending at B seems over-concentrated, if not Black can really exploit W weakness

I'm struggling to find a really satisfactory altternative

I guess as Blcak did not follow the joseki perhaps f the variation my be a plan]
;B[nq]C[/L : This is a probe I think, threatening to cut black stones by pushing through Q4. I was primarily concerned with the cut, but I feel the response I came with in the game is bad.


djna: this is a pretty severe invasion. Generally such violence is precipitate. Maybe  more interesting to press from the outside to gain strength and see W spend more and more stones protecting 16 points of territory.


It turns out very well for Black.]
(;W[oq]SQ[kp][nq]C[

djna: problem here is that B can probably now split teh L4 stone off.


for the B and W marked groups to run for the centre is sometimes ok for W, but it needs W to gain some pressure on the left. Her the B shimari in teh bottom left is too strong.]
;B[no];W[nn]C[/L : I played this hane to prevent black from sealing the white group in the corner.


djna: in  concept this is good -  the end result though is horrible,

I think though I woulod play this - as you say B at P6 is unpleasant - ytends to buiold too strongly down the right.]
;B[mo];W[on]C[

djna: now If I played  this I would think "surely sente"


So far W is doing what i think is sensible.];B[ko]C[

djna: at first sght wrong : Attaching to weak stones is bad.


However it does seem to need a reply. B threatens tp grow a big side.


as B I would probably play J 3. threatening to connect under and chase W out to the centre.]

(;W[jo]C[
djna: I've looked for other ideas, but this does seem like a very key point]
;B[kn]C[
djna: I thouht B might really go for complications and cross-cut, but this seems good]

(;W[jp]C[

djna: i think this a heavy move and maybe even a losing ,move.

see vafriations];B[im]C[

djna: really hard to avoid giving B big side or huge thickness now]

(;W[mq]C[

djna: this now gets very difficult for W, protecting one group tends to weaken the other]
;B[nr];W[mp];B[np];W[jn];B[jm]TR[nr]C[

djna: note how pushing from inside is building B strength.

marked move is big threat on both sides];W[km];B[lm];W[lo];B[ln]
;W[lp];B[mn];W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[nk];W[lk]TR[im][jm]C[/L : This seems slow. Right now, white has three weak groups, which makes it a failure as an opening, I think.


djna: even two weak groups is bad.  if  W can leave corner group and attack the two w stones successfully then the position is actually good for W.]
;B[nl];W[or]TR[rq]C[

djna: but I think a move in the corner is needed so ...];B[ik]
TR[kk][lk][kl][km]C[

djna now W has no strategic play

big group on side is too large to sacrifice 

marked group is meaningless,  


From here I think B has to make a bad error in order for W to have a chance]
;W[mr];B[ns]C[
djna: again note how defence of side weakens corner];W[gq];B[fp]
;W[gr];B[jd]TR[kk][lk][kl][im][km][ho][fp]C[

djna: if playing H5 is sente B should do it, linking marked stones makes another moyo.

H3 may be good follow up, so H5 may well be sente. in which case I would play this.

Otherwise B's choice is very nice. 

The temptation is to attack close to the 4 marked w stones, this is much better, large scale growth and either the stones are absorbed into a moyo or they run and the top right becomes B.

The theme here is that B can grow everywhere; W has no potential.]
;W[pm]C[

djna: Too slow. Why does B care about these stones? If you're not already alive then it was gam over long ago.]
;B[rm]C[
djna: nice response, but  B should let these stones go - H5, C10  or F17]
;W[qm];B[rl];W[rq];B[rn];W[ck]C[

djna: so W got a little lucky, B should have got this point.]
;B[ci]TR[gn][gr]C[

djna: in accordance with an important principle: use thickness to attack,

for my money: just a little risky - B is winnin, sometimes you should just consolidate.


W needs to cut up some B groups , the marked stone and the marked gap, just give  a glimmer of hope.]
;W[cn];B[cf];W[de];B[bf];W[hc]LB[bk:1][bl:A][cm:2][dm:3][bn:4]
TR[ck][cn]C[

djna: maybe too conservative? The two marked stones are quite vulnerable (no centre to run to)

placement inside at  A may be hard to answer, W 1, B2 etc. leaves W in trouble,

Also B's corner and side groups are  is a little vulnerable. I would be looking for moves

to strengthen the W marked group and attack.

For example F6 - could this work? Get the W group strong enough so that E13 may be interesting.

Or attach at B4 to make W string.


Here W seems to be playing ordinary territoty moves when he needs something more.]
;B[gp]C[

djna: now the chance is gone ... in sente];W[hp];B[fr];W[iq]
;B[ic]C[

djna: I would attack the left W group, but this is probably enough.]
;W[oc]C[/L : Does this come too late?



djna: in my estimation, yes. You are probably entitled to one live group up there, but you need more than a simple living invasion. You need to get a real fight going.]
;B[mc];W[qc];B[rc]
(;W[qb]C[/L : I wanted to settle quickly, however Q16 is the proper way, according to joseki.

djna: by this stage normal joseki probably don't apply. too  much development elsewhere.

Simple life is ok];B[pd];W[rb];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[qf]
C[

djna: slight failure from B's perspective, W lived in sente. That's always annoying.

However B territory is large so next move feels natural, but see variation]

(;W[nj]C[

djna: I can understand the need to do something here.

I wonder if some work on the left in preparation is better]
;B[oj];W[pk];B[pj];W[ok]C[/L : Misread. I was eager to cut, and forgot the simple reponse that came...


djna: B was always too string in this area for a serious fight by W I think.

But this patches up B aji - very unfortuante];B[pl];W[mk];B[ml]
;W[ji];B[hi]C[

djna: now the lack of preparation hurts];W[hn]C[

djna: too slow, how many points did it make? what did it protect?

any of A toE are bigger];W[ch]TR[hi][ii][hk][ik]C[

djna: nice idea - this is the kind of move that if played earlier might have swung the game.

djna: He has eyes in several ways, for example A is certain, B and C are miai, so I think he's alive. Best you get is perhaps the three stones.

And this is an important point. Over the board, as a UK 1 dan, I *never* did.
(and maybe that's why I  never progressed to 2dan - discuss)

sometimes one has to play one's  best guess


My thinking goes like this:

1). major priority:: connect  marked stones. hence build some outer strength.

2). if possible show B he has over-played.

3). If necessary make him capture the two numbered stones. I'm prepared to give up 10 points in the corner. I we get a race to capture between the B staone and the two sacrifice stones then he'll play on his own territory. 

Allow for the worst: lose the stones. :Provided B comes out with no improved potential for growth then we can cope.

I think that my suggested move also bears a better realtionship with L4 and as a shoulder-hit against  B probably causes him  more trouble.]
