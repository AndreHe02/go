RE[B+76.5]

C[Thank you for reviewing our game.

Ben is Black and Frank is White.  We are both about 30th kyu. This game was played on DGS.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[gp]C[Ben: I am a little embarrased of this move.  Since this game was played over such a long time period, I feel as though i progressed a lot over the course of the game.

E - So its not the best move, but its not the worst either...]
;W[jd];B[jp];W[pj];B[dj];W[pm];B[mp];W[nq];B[mq];W[ob];B[gd]
;W[pg];B[ic];W[jc];B[jb]LB[jj:E][cm:D][cc:C][cq:B][dg:A]C[Instead of this, you should play somewhere more profitable.  Suggestions are marked]
;W[mr];B[lr];W[hd];B[id];W[ie];B[hc];W[ee];B[fe]C[This may be a bit unnecissary.  Though you do cut white off from the other group, there is still plenty of room for him on the side.  Also, it makes you look a little thin in this area]
;W[he];B[eg];W[ge];B[fd];W[ff];B[ef];W[de];B[ce];W[cd];B[df]
C[Good sequence, you made out well here.  You should just remember to secure your corner at some point, as white at c16 can make plenty of trouble.]
;W[lc];B[em]C[This is a bit loose:  white could invade beneath.]
;W[fg];B[fh]C[Good.  Capping two stones is very nice here.]
;W[eh];B[dh];W[ei];B[fj]LB[ej:A]C[This makes your position a bit loose again.  White can still escape, and do some damage in the process.  A may have been better]
;W[cf];B[ed];W[be];B[de];W[gh];B[fi]LB[bd:B][cc:A]C[It is worth more to you to secure the corner.  Instead of this move, attack at A or B.]
;W[gi];B[ej]C[You didn't need to make this move.  White's last move was slow and did not need a response.  You should use this chance to kill white in the corner]
;W[cg];B[cc]LB[bd:A]C[A play at A would be better by hurting the white position more.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[ad];B[ac];W[ja];B[ia]LB[bf:A]C[You should let white take this piece and kill his group instead at A.]
;W[ka];B[kb];W[la];B[ib]C[You should definately keep going.  You are not in danger and could use this move to push white another step.  Or, even better, by killing the white group on the left side.]
;W[ci]
(;B[di]C[This is not bad, but you could probably gain more by being more aggressive.  This is your turf, so you should fight for it.  See alternate pathway for suggestion where you could take some pieces and leave white with a hard position to defend.]
;W[dg]C[White should not have played here.];B[ch]LB[bf:A]C[Good, but the move at A may be better...]
;W[gg]C[White needs to make up their mind whether they want to live on the side or not.  White should either play hard for these pieces or abandon them.]
;B[bi]C[Good.  This kills the group pretty effectively.];W[fl]
;B[hk]C[Good cut off of white's aggressive play.  A stronger white player would probably be able to hurt you after this move, but this is good for this opponent.]
;W[ii]C[white is playing too conservatively.  Balck should pick up the slack.]
;B[jj]LB[jk:A]C[This is good, though A is a bit safer.];W[gk]
;B[gj];W[cj];B[ck];W[hj];B[ij]C[Good sequence.];W[hi];B[gl]
;W[hl];B[fk];W[ik];B[gk]C[This was good by white to separate your two stones, but he needs to follow up at the marked locations to secure his double atari if he wants to make use of it.]
;W[gn];B[il];W[hm];B[jk]C[Good.  The white stones look pretty weak.]
;W[jm];B[fm];W[gm]C[White shouldn't have done this.  There will be time to connect here later...]
;B[km]LB[im:A]C[Cutting at A may be better.];W[im];B[jl]C[Good, this was, of course, necissary.]
;W[jn];B[jh]C[I would use this move to better capture the white stones you were after, as your lower side is pretty thin.]
;W[hg];B[kf]C[Good.];W[kc];B[io]LB[kn:B][je:A]SQ[ii][hj][hi]
[gi][gh][hg][gg][fg][ff][ge][hd][ie][he]C[You should use this move to attack the marked stones by cutting at A, or at least playing this move at B.]
;W[kn];B[ln]C[This is too thin.  White should punish you.];W[mo]
;B[lo];W[np];B[mn];W[no];B[om]LB[ok:B][ol:A]C[Attaching to the white stone is too aggressive.  Try one of these other options.]
;W[op];B[nn]LB[nj:D][nr:C][lb:B][je:A]C[This is ok, but slow.  You have many places to attack white at this point (marked).]
;W[pn];B[fo]C[This probably isn't important, though you should remember that your lower left corner is still open to invasion.]
;W[po];B[on]LB[nj:B][ol:A]C[This isn't important.  You should use this move to expand upwards (marked plays).]
;W[lb]C[Too bad, you could have made many points here.];B[ji]
C[This is a good connecting move.  You can actually feel the safety of it...]
;W[kl];B[lm]LB[lk:A]C[White could have made something of this if he had played A next, but black shut him down nicely on the next play.]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[nl]LB[mk:A]C[Extending at A is better, but this is good.]
;B[lk];W[mk];B[kk];W[if];B[me]LB[nk:A]C[A play at A would probably be better, as white will give an expected response.]
;W[mg];B[ng]LB[ni:C][nh:B][nf:A]C[This is too aggressive (even though it worked out in this case). Try one of the marked moves]
;W[kg];B[jg]C[Ok, but you're starting to look spread out and disconnected.]
;W[je];B[lf]C[An atari is better here.];W[jf];B[lg];W[le];B[mf]
LB[mh:A]C[Atari from the other direction, at A.];W[ld]C[White should have extended...]
;B[mh];W[nh];B[oh]LB[ni:A]C[You should atari from the other direction, at A.]
;W[ni];B[mi]LB[og:A]C[You need to connect at A instead.];W[pl]
C[No!];B[ol]C[Yes.];W[nk];B[og];W[of];B[nj];W[mj];B[oj];W[ok]
;B[oi];W[pi];B[oe];W[pe];B[nf];W[nd];B[pf];W[pk];B[lj]LB[ph:A]
C[Atari at A instead.];W[ph];B[od];W[md]C[Ben: Frank has such a strong wall going on there.  later in the game i pierced it at Q14.  i think if he plugged that hole up sooner he would have done much beter.

E - Yes, for sure.  That is his most important point right now.]
;B[ih]LB[qf:A]C[Ben: this is a small point.  there were probably much bigger points to be had.

E - Exactly.  Like A.];W[ig]C[Unnecissary.];B[ms]LB[nr:A]C[A is better.]
;W[nr];B[lq]C[You didn't need this.];W[dc];B[db];W[ab];B[cb]
C[You could actually have ignored that last move.];W[gc];B[gb]
;W[go];B[ho];W[hp];B[hq];W[gq];B[ip];W[fp];B[hp];W[fn];B[eo]
;W[ns];B[ls];W[ga];B[fc];W[af]C[Ben: I have played Frank a few times now.  he loves to try to bring his stones back to life like this.  I think it is great. he usually gives me a good run for my money!

Yes, this is definately fun to try and helps both players hone their skills (but in this case, you have him easily dead)]
;B[bg];W[ag];B[bf];W[dq];B[fq]C[Good play.];W[eq];B[ep];W[cp]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[bp]C[Your last too moves are too aggressive.  White could live in the corner and could take some of your pieces if you play to strong-handedly.]
;W[co];B[en];W[dn];B[el];W[dm];B[cm];W[dl]C[Ben: I was surprised by this move.  It doesn't seem to do much. I think he was trying to kill  my group at E7.  he had me sweating with this invasion.  I think he could have gained more territory had he made a few different moves.

E- Yes, white shouldn't have made contact with your stones and played lower and faster than one space per stone.  He cannot capture this group and should not really try.  Instead he should concentrate on making life.]
;B[cl]C[good.];W[cn];B[dk]C[You didn't need this.  Your stones are safe because you can always capture.  Use this move more offensively.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[bn]C[good.];W[bo];B[ao]LB[bm:A]C[this leraves you too weak.  you are only asking white to take some of your stones by playing at A.]
;W[bq];B[an];W[am]C[White should have taken the single stone.]
;B[bm];W[ap];B[fs];W[es];B[gs]C[Ben: I think we both need work on both the offensive and defensive side of invasions.

E- well, I think you are both still uncertain as to how to play on the edges and corners.  Some practice in this area will help you understand the 'standard sequences' and when you need to protect yourself.]
;W[oc];B[qf]C[good.  this is worth a good bundle of points.]
;W[ne];B[of];W[nc]C[this is bad.  he really need to contain black instead.]
;B[qe]LB[qd:C][rh:B][rd:A]C[At this point you want to play fast and loose, trying to eat up as much territory as possible.  Marked plays are better.]
;W[qd];B[rh];W[qg];B[rg];W[ri];B[rd];W[rc];B[re];W[qc];B[qi]
LB[qh:A]C[Ben: i think i was just trying to eliminate as much of Frank's territory as I could with this invasion.  not trying to make any eye-space because i knew my stones would be connected to a living group.

yes, but white should have simply cut you at A.];W[rj];B[qh]
;W[qj];B[si]LB[sc:A]C[A is better because white will also have to make a follow up move, leaving you with sente.]
;W[sj];B[sh];W[sd];B[se];W[sf]C[Ben: I think that would have been a good move had that eye space been part of a stand-alone group.  T17 would have stopped me and given Frank a few more points.  By him not playing there, it alowed me to continue my invasion.

Yes.];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[nm];B[rb]C[Good.];W[qb];B[sa];W[qa]
;B[sb]C[Best to let him force you to connect these stones - it gives you one more move elsewhere.]
;W[ra]C[zero point move.];B[mm];W[oo];B[ke]C[Ben: another small point... and that's it.

Thanks.

yes, this could have been done before the zero point moves.]
;W[kd]C[That was pretty well played.  My suggestions are that it may be helpful for you two to play around near the edge and corners, just to get the dynamic.  White needs to be more aggressive most of the time, as he often folded in upon his own position.  Black needs to watch out for corner invasions (like in the lower left). If you play the star point as a corner enclosure, you always need another play in that area to secure the corner from invasion. Another suggestion is to think, in any given attack whether you are trying to kill the stones or let them live and reduce their territory as much as possible, then to play accordingly.  Many of your moves were too loose and a more  experienced player would hurt your attacking stones.
