;B[jd];W[jk];B[dc];W[dj]C[What is the most appropriate joseki in a 13 13 game?

Since I never played much 13X13 games myself I have no idea. But given the fact the board is much smaller the corners become even more important than in a 19X19 game.]
;B[gc]C[This seems slow by black];W[ki]C[Was there a better move? 

It's big in 19X19 but here it seems slow.  D9 looks good to me also L8]
;B[gg]C[i dont understand why black play tengen?Would it be better to go at the weekness in g3-g4?

Black is experimenting a bit as he's 6K and also wants to enjoy the game. Playing on the Tengen this early in the game doesn't do much. Although it does threaten to in vade at G4. White shoud ignore and attack.]
;W[gk]C[I wanted to play j8 but i had prefer to play g3.What would you do? 

Attack at D9 or C9 or L8.];B[cg]C[Now things are geting difficult. In 5 moves Black has built a nice moyo.]
;W[fg]TR[bi][ci][dh][eh][gg][hf][ie][jd][kd][ld]C[At this time i realized that he wanted to get a big moyo,and i tried to reduce it.where would you play to reduce his moyo? 

At L8. Corners first then the center.];B[ff];W[eg];B[ef];W[gf]

(;W[be]C[This is too small. Still the right side is open and also the black corner can be invaded.]
;B[ld]C[does the nozoki at l11 good?is it possible live ?

No try for yourself. Black tenuki's and closes the corner.]

(;W[kf]C[i should have played at l9 i think...What do you think?

Yes L9 was possible (see variation) and better because now black can tenuki again (and he will take the corner).]
;B[ck]C[Ouch!];W[cj];B[dk];W[ek];B[el]
(;W[fk]C[i think i should have played at f2 but i prefered to play cautionly.

Very good. If you can't read it out don't play it!. F2 would not have been better. See some variations.]

It was all bluff there's no way B could have lived there.];W[lk]
C[i think i should have played at l2?where would you hve played?

You played well except that you developped too many plans and let black get away.]

thanks you for reviewing this game

Corners first, play the biggest move. Count liberties. Try to read 2 moves ahead. Your doing quite well!.

Best regards,
