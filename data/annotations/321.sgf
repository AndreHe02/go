(;B[pf]C[This move is fine, but you should also consider the pincer.]
(;W[pb];B[qc]
(;W[kd]C[This move is a little thin.  W has to come back later and  add amove to the right of this move, which is inefficient.]
;B[jp];W[gq]C[usually W extends one point further, which puts more
pressure on the B stone on the side.];B[jj];W[qn]
(;B[ql]C[Usually the attach is better.  This way W gets the corner, and B's wall is making territory that is open on the left side.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[rn];B[om];W[cj];B[lf];W[jm]C[Good reduction, right on the sector line.]
;B[lo]C[This move feels a little submissive to me.  Taking territory that is open on the edge, and it is far enough from W that he doesn't have to answer.]

;B[lg]C[Good move, on the key shape point.];W[of]

He has 50 points of secure territory, 5 points komi, and a big framework.  B has about 45 points of secure territory, and is thick in the center.]
;B[fd]

(;W[ce];B[be];W[df];B[cd];W[de];B[dc];W[ec];B[db]C[Now B has the corner territory and W gets the wall.  W gets territory on the upper side, so he didn't lose very much.  This wall means that
W can pull out the stones in the center which is big.];W[cg];B[bf];W[ki]

;B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[hh];B[ig]
(;W[jg]C[W is already connected, so this move is not necessary.
It just gives up sente, and even forces B to capture one stone.  Giving up sente here is B's first step to
giving back this game.];B[kg];W[jh];B[ie];W[id]C[W loses sente here, so B can play in front of the W wall, reducing its worth.]

used to make it are wasted.];W[ch];B[bi];W[bg];B[ag];W[bj]

;B[il]
(;W[im]C[This is a mistake, since it just gets captured.  W should
crawl into V's territory instead.  This would increase W's lead a lot.  W must think he can capture something when the two stones get cut off, but the two stones will have have too few liberties.]
;B[hm]

;W[oh];B[ng];W[pk]C[Good.];B[go]C[W will still win if he can keep the lower left corner.
B is thick on the outside so W is some danger.  In this kind of situation, B can often make a one eyed group underneith and force a semeai,]

(;W[gp]C[This is just a dame.  Many other moves also threaten to pull out the stone, but are safer.  W is still ahead, so should be playing conservatively here.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[bq];W[bp];B[cr]C[good moves for B.  She is almost alive, and the W group has trouble making two eyes of its own.  B can't
live but W has to read carefully, or B will stage an upset here.]
