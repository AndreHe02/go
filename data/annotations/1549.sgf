;B[dg];W[ef]C[Up to here the game seems to proceed quite normal.]

(;B[ce]TR[cn]C[But at this point I would chose another joseki.

This joseki stresses the importance of the left edge. But in fact, this is the least important edge of the board. One reason is that the marked stone is low. Much more important is the upper edge or the upper left corner. See variations.]
;W[cd];B[cj];W[eg];B[dh];W[bd];B[po]C[Very good! W's last move was definitly to slow. It does not realy endager the black group, does not secure an interesting amount of territory and protects the cut in a quite questionable way, because there are still some good invasion points for b left.]
;W[re];B[rd]C[Very good, w's stone accomplishes now nearly nothing. Very questionable move by w.]

;W[qf];B[pg];W[rk];B[rl];W[rj];B[hd]TR[bd][qm]C[I think you should instead play a calm move and protect one of your cuts, maybe at the marked position. There are simply too many cutting points. Thanks to the questionable w move (marked) and your new great wall, there are still enough invasion/reducing possibilities left, even if w gets to play there one more stone.

And then, your moyo is impressive, how about a moyo contest? My expirience is often that the one who invades first loses the game. :)]
;W[ie];B[gf];W[fd]TR[bd]C[Oops, now it gets apparent that w should have played this move earlier, instead of the marked stone]
;B[gd];W[ig];B[hg]TR[gh]C[iken-tobi (marked) seems to be preferable, because it moves faster out. W is too thin and cannot cut it.]
;W[fi];B[ic]C[All in all moving out is more urgent. Let these moves for later, they are endgame. And even if you would get two eyes: running out is better than living inside.]

[is][ls][ms][ns][os][ps]C[I think your biggest mistake is that you play too hard. E.g. move 47, 77 or 83. Sometimes it is better to play a calm move and secure something than to fight always as hard as possible. You simply cannot get everything. Or move 129, where you wanted to play on both sides. This move followed a hairy sequence of which I did not understand much, but adding the second stone on the fifth row definitly did not help you.]
