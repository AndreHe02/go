C[
Opening moves are somewhat arbitrary to me. I focus on the corners when making my first two moves.]

C[These moves were good.

Both sides are fighting for those two stones being careful with with their bases.]
;W[io]LB[lp:a][lq:b]C[I made this move, J5 with the three thoughts in mind.

1. Try to block Black's two stones in.
2. Access to the middle.
3. Good support for a stone at a or b.

Dependent on Black's next move.

--

W should have reinforced his W stones.];B[gm];W[el]C[Since Black ran out to the middle I thought I could either capture Black's two stones at F5 and G5 or extend myself forcing Black to have a weak connection with this move if Black would cut at E7 .

--

This sequence should answer why i think J5 was wrong. B can extend that direction if he wasn't. W does not need to worry about it. W has to worry about his weak two stones.]

;B[kp];W[ip]C[too conservative play...];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[kn]
C[Secure some territory and make it harder for black to extend into the middle.

--   W is securing NO territory here.

The game in the part of the border is over for now. There are much much bigger points around the board. Look at the two corners where no stones have been played.

In the last moves W lost opportunity, B had to respond because he needed to secure his base.]
;B[de]C[And W hands in the chance to B.];W[qq]C[Trying to keep Black as small as possible here. May have been a mistake, should have thought about the rest of the board.

;W[qe];B[nd];W[jd]C[W formation on the right top is premature. W should have played on the right; not at the top.]
;B[kc]C[Wrong response by B.

B should attack the weak W group. while doing this he will have a chance stronger around the top right corner and on the right middle.

then he easily be able to cut K16 from other groups and have a chance to extend to L17.]
;W[fh]C[Realized I was going to allow Black to consume more territory moving into the middle from here so I thought I'd make it harder for Black by playing here.

--

last 2 moves seem to serve no purpose. And W move here is TOO high. it has no connection to any W group around.]

(;B[dh]C[I don't think it is the appropriate response. I would play between W stone and the strong W group extending toward the center.

W has a base so W can use this to attack B on the middle right...

But still the move is sente.];B[qc]
(;W[oq]C[I had been staring at this sectionof the board for a while. I thought that it would be possible to take this territory but was unsure where to play. I thought the two Black stones at P4 and Q4 should not have lived.

amybe you are right. but this doesn't look like the way to do it...]

the idea is good.];B[ln];W[km];B[mm];W[ko];B[kk]C[This sequence worked aaginst the idea... W was trying to cut B but just the opposite happened :)]
;W[jh]C[Since Black extended into the middle I was going to try to keep his territory smaller than mine.

there is no territory in center.

Actually, B could have killed W stones i he had realized this before... you are not trying to make territory small for him, you are trying to save your stones :)]
