C[Dear rewiewer,



First of all, many thanks for reviewing my game.



In this game i played black,  and it seems to me that my opponent played badly, but i wasn't able to punish him.



Thanks for helping me to improve



Thomas

[dn:B]C[janr: A or B are more common.];B[jp];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]
;B[pi]LB[cf:C][qk:B][qo:A]C[janr: on the right side, there remains some space for a white invasion (i.e. white can make a base easily)
I would prefer A or B  to protect the right side better.  C is also a good point of course]
;W[qo];B[pl]LB[qm:A]C[janr: Black has to spend another move to avoid that white makes a base.
I would prefer the more aggressive move at A (black is strong)]

janr: I would consider p5 to split the stones without making them stronger.
The game move is ok too as it splits the stones.];W[pp];B[op]

(;B[no]LB[qq:A]C[janr: I think it is more urgent to play A to avoid that white gets sufficient eye shape.]
;W[ol];B[pk];W[qq];B[nn]LB[mm:C][fo:A][gp:B]C[janr: I think this move makes white stronger. 
I would play A or B to enlarge to moyo and let white the task to reduce it or comming out further]

(;W[qb]LB[rb:A]C[janr: usually white plays A (see variation)]

Compare the difference in endgame when black does not play here: white's sente is a lot smaller.]
;W[rb]LB[cf:B][mk:C][hq:A]C[As I said, this is very slow.
White should play A or B (or around C)];B[mk];W[pr]C[An endgame move]
;B[or]LB[fo:A];W[nl];B[qr]LB[fo:A]C[a huge mistake.



i should have played at o9

janr: This move is an endgame move.
I would enlarge the moyo at A.];W[lm];B[mn];W[lk];B[kl];W[mj]

(;B[nk]C[janr: this is a mistake.
Black can not save the stone at a low price.
It is better to enlarge to moyo];W[ok];B[nj];W[oj];B[ni];W[oi]
;B[nh];W[pj]C[White can capture some stones.];B[qj];W[qi];B[ph]
;W[qk];B[rj];W[rk];B[ri]LB[oh:A]C[janr: First make the atari at A]
;W[pm]LB[og:C][pg:F][oh:A][qh:E][rh:G][ql:D][om:B]C[janr: having A exchanged for B is a plus for black
Now, the sequence A, C, D is sente for white, as black should defend against white E (atari), F, G]
;B[cc]C[janr: Black should try to use his influence.  The 3-3 invasion makes white strong.  White's wall will neutralize a lot of blacks influence.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed]LB[ec:A][fc:B]C[janr: usually, white plays A or B]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ch]C[janr: Black got a large corner]
;B[cj]C[janr: I don't like the invasion very much as white can run into black's moyo while attacking this stone.]
;W[eh];B[ej];W[cl];B[fo]C[g10 better ?];W[fl];B[gj];W[hl];B[ij]
;W[jl];B[kk];W[jk];B[jj];W[fc]C[janr: a large move.  But it is not sente.]
;B[fb]C[I think it's larger to play in the lower left corner,]
;W[gb];B[ea];W[gp]C[Now white can play first in this area];B[fp]
;W[hk];B[hj];W[fk];B[fj];W[ip]C[i didn't know how to handle this move
janr: it is very hard for black to connect now that white got so strong above.]

(;B[iq]LB[jq:A]C[janr: I would play a more solid move (e.g. A) and invade the corner after white prevents the connection.]
