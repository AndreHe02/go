C[buckyyowza:  Hello.  Commentary by Mark Fyffe, prefixed by 'buckyyowza'.  I hope you enjoy reading through my review and find by comments to be of use.  Closing comments on #131.

GIFU7: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
teddy99: hi];B[qd]C[Hello reviewer, I play black in this game and I had lot of problem during opening.]
;W[cd];B[pq];W[od];B[ld];W[jd];B[pf]TR[ld]C[buckyyowza: so far so good!  R16 and Q14 make a good solid shape.  I would treat your pincer stone as a sacrifice for now, draw play away from this area and use its aji later on when it becomes useful.

Here I don't know how to play];W[of];B[pg];W[qc]
(;B[pc]LB[rc:A]C[buckyyowza: this is ok, though I think S17 is more efficient.  Here, white is splitting the corner and black should get sente.  In general the fewer moves during opening the better, as the more it is played out the less aji is left in the situation.

is this ok?];W[pd]
(;B[oc]LB[qe:A]C[buckyyowza: black is better to stay thick on the right side than to become enclosed in the corner.  This line of play allows white to gain thickness and sente, which is not good considering black has left an empty corner.  I would prefer black to play at R15 now]
;W[qe];B[rd];W[rc];B[nc];W[re]C[buckyyowza: agreed, this result favors white, though if black plays M14 now it is not a huge advantage... just loss of sente.

result is not good for black];B[qn]LB[lf:A]C[buckyowza: black should jump out at M14 now.  the upper side stones need to be developed a little more before tenuki. R6 is overplay in the lower right.]
;W[dq];B[do];W[lc];B[nd]LB[kc:A]C[buckyyowza: simply L17 is more efficient.  O16 is aji keshi.

guess Black need to play one more move];W[oe];B[kc];W[kd];B[mc]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[le];B[md];W[jb];B[mb];W[jc];B[la]C[buckyyowza: not necessarily, though black loses sente so has to come back to it later. see var.

Black is sealed off by white]
(;W[eo];B[en];W[ep];B[dm]C[buckyyowza: D6 is better here.  D7 is only good for developing into the center, but black doesn't need to be concerned about that.  solid play to settle stones faster during this phase of the game is key to getting ahead in a middle-game fight.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[jp]C[buckyyowza: K4 is beautiful! ;-)  C11 is too slow, I think. As black now, I would like to make a few more sente moves in the center, then invade at E16.

Is K4 ok or I should play C11?];W[cl];B[bn];W[dl];B[el];W[ek]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[em];W[gl]
(;B[gk]C[buckyyowza: though it seems the thing to do, this is no good for black. white gets a nice wall and black's stones become split into two weak groups in white's sphere.  In fact, I would suggest that this move is where black starts to lose this game.]
;W[ej]
(;B[hl]C[buckyyowza: this forces white to cut black off.  see var.]
;W[gm];B[gn];W[hm];B[hn];W[im];B[fo];W[hk]C[buckyyowza: white is too big now!]
;B[hj];W[ik];B[ec];W[ed]
(;B[fd]LB[cc:A]C[buckyyowza: this is too hard with the k17 wall, better to play at C17 now.  black can not survive running toward the center with this much white thickness working against him.]
;W[dc];B[ee];W[dd];B[fg];W[gj];B[eb];W[fe]LB[dg:A]C[buckyyowza: this is a mistake by white.  black has no eye-space, so D13 is best keep black small and suffering.  With F15, white is giving black an opportunity to build good shape.]
;B[ge];W[fc];B[ff];W[gc];B[fi];W[fj];B[ih]LB[cg:B][dh:A]C[buckyyowza: black truly has no where to go in this direction, though trying to run is good for building eyespace.  Since white left it wide open, I would work on building at least one eye on the left side first. D12 or C13 look like better options.]
;W[gd]LB[kh:B][ji:A]C[buckyyowza: overplay by white!  simply K11 is enough to keep black in.  Now black can jump out to K12 and run to freedom.]

(;B[hd]C[buckyyowza: black has an interesting opportunity at C18 here, see var.]
;W[hc]C[Black is ok at this point I think];B[gq];W[fq];B[jl]
;W[oo];B[np]C[buckyyowza: I prefer R4 here. white is easier to contain if the right side moyo stays solid.]
;W[qo]
(;B[pn]C[buckyyowza: too conservative!  black is very thick here so white should be cut at every opportunity. Q5 is a perfectly OK play, see var.]
;W[po];B[on];W[no];B[mp];W[mo];B[lp];W[mm];B[pj];W[pk];B[oj]
C[buckyyowza: R9 is urgent for black now.]
(;W[ok];B[nk];W[nl];B[qk];W[mk];B[qi];W[nj];B[rq]C[buckyyowza: actually, R9 was needed instead of P10 to save the R6 stones. It is trying to save the R6 in the next moves that loses the game for black.  Nonetheless, I will end my review here.

Black lost this game early by starting fights before a framework for fighitng was truly in place.  I would suggest keeping a couple of simple rules of thumb in mind early in the game and see if you improve ;-)

- play big points in sente, then tenuki
- if playing in gote, settle your stones in the simplest way possible.  For example, play M14 at #18 instead of tenuki.
- do not leave weak groups without enough compensation, only tenuki in sente!

If you can settle your groups and keep sente, then you will win without trouble... unless of course your opponent also settles his groups and keeps sente ;-)

I hope you have found my comments to be of use!  Please let me know if you have any further questions about this game.
