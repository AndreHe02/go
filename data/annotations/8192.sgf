C[Hello, Dear Reviewer!

I play this game by black on KGS without time limit and lost 4,5 points. My opponent say after game, that i was leading till end of the game or end of middle game. White was stronger, than i, but i play with him some times and not take handi. So, it was friendly game, where we can try new moves and ideas.
I added some variations, where my feelings tell me, that i can play more solid or better. Also, i added comments to some moves to explain my ideas.
Please, can you pay more attention to opening and endgame big points.
Comments for both sides will be great, but only for black is also very excellent.
Thanks a lot for your time and your review!

P.S. Sorry for my bad English :)
P.P.S. This sgf file was prepare by Quarry, linux sgf viewer. I re-check this file in CGoban 3, all comments was ok, so.. if you have some problems with comments-please mail me

Hagios: Hello, Ingtar!  I'll do my best to help you find the important moments of the game, and find ways to improve.]
;B[qe];W[dc];B[oq]C[I usually play 3-4 or 4-4 stones, so here is start
of my experiment

H: I don't know much about these high openings, so no opinion.  It's not my normal style of play.]
;W[dq];B[cj];W[cf];B[do]LB[cn:B][dn:A]C[H: This is okay, but I'd also consider jumping to A or B instead, to avoid a complicated fight.]

;W[gm];B[gn];W[fm]C[H: It's hard to say that B has a good result here.]
;B[bn]
(;W[dk]C[H: A mistake.  See the variation for W's better way.]
;B[bp];W[cn];B[bq]C[I am secure LL corner, make some wall on lower side and have some aji on the left side. I think, this position good for black

H: Yes, but W should have had a good position.  See var.];W[ck]
;B[jc]C[I play this move to limit white power on top. this point  was best direction for white.]
;W[hp]C[Here i fell in deep thinking. And make some unusual movie for my taste.]
(;B[ip]C[I think, that connection was very heavy and white can easy limit my wall here. And this stones was not so important now, but i need to keep my eyes open, because corner have aji.

H: "Heavy" means that you have a running group you have to save.  Connection wasn't heavy--it was correct!  Remember the proverb, "even an idiot connects against a peep."  See vars.]
;W[pc];B[oc]LB[nc:A][pj:B]C[common variation here is cap this white stone. he take corner and little part of top side, but with G7 stone i cant use this influence. It is correct?

H: This move is hard to call correct.  It breaks the rule, do not attach against a weak stone.  I would play around A and attack W to solidify my territory, or cap and then play around B.]

;W[pb];B[pg];W[nd]LB[oc:A]C[H: Now we can see, B ends up being the one under attack.  The strange move at A must be blamed.]
;B[mc];W[oi];B[ng];W[me];B[lg];W[kd];B[kc];W[kf]C[here i feel, that now is pincer time. I want to cut white stones to prevent white moyo and keep white stones separated and without base.

H: You can't assume that W has no base.  s18 is a sente eye.]

;W[qo];B[pn];W[qn];B[jh]C[after moves in corner, i have 2 wall and white have some early moyo and one weak group. so i try
 to attack it and run into white moyo

H: I see no large W moyo.  One problem to avoid is not seeing your enemy's territory as daunting--take your time and build your own territory, before you worry about destroying his!  Invading stones are weak and can be attacked.]

I try to keep pressure on white group.];W[ig];B[cd];W[de];B[ff]

H: This ko threat was worth 18 points, plus more due to the atari of c5.  This ko threat was huge!  You overlooked that you had a LOT of ko threats in the area around A.  I think you could have won this ko, or at least profited from it, without losing such a big group.]

And thanks one more time.. No, thousand times! for your review!

H: This was an interesting game!  You should begin studying joseki, so you can learn some ways to attack your opponent without damaging your own position.  In the lower-left and upper-right, you hurt your positions because you wanted to attack, which left you with a hard situation to handle.

Your endgame moves were fine, no need to worry much there.

You made some whole-board position mistakes (such as the choice in upper-right) so you may like to find a book on whole-board thinking.]
