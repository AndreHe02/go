C[Hello,

First time submitting a game, I've just started to know go 3 weeks ago and hav

e been reading it since then (mostly GTL reviewed sgf ^^). So I'm beginning to

 play on KGS and this is my first game. I'm not ranked but I'm assuming around

 30K.

I felt that this was a really fun interesting game. I thought I made a lot of 

mistakes with making a living group in the bottom center, but overall I felt I

 played decent. But I'd really like to know what I'm playing wrong, good, and 

what I can do better to improve..

Thanks in advance...

-------------------
I think you're better than 30kyu, but just keep playing games and you'll even
tually get ranked.

Since you won there is only so much I can correct, but I'll do what I can.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[nc];W[mq];B[dn];W[fo];B[bo]C[b3b0p: is this good?

I really don't know, but I think that's where I would play.]

(;B[el]CR[dl]TR[dk]SQ[dm][dn][bo]C[That's a pretty agressive move right there.  If black is able to keep D8 
alive, the triangle stones and square ones will be cut apart, and neither of t
hem are that strong of groups.  Additionally, if you had just played C8, you c
an secure the left.];W[cl]
(;B[fl];W[cn];B[ck];W[do]C[b3b0p: i wanted to cut the group but my 2 stones is dying

B7 at move 17 seems to be the only way to retaliate, but it gets difficult.]
;B[bl];W[cm];B[bj];W[bm];B[fj]C[This move doesn't look big enough to me.  If you want to secure the lef
t, I would go with d or c 13 to strengthen the top left stone as well.  You mi
ght also consider playing along the top or right side here.]
;W[gl];B[gk]C[b3b0p: panic!!

Calm down than :).  White things he's got the attack here, but he's just wasti
ng moves.  Use this time to counterattack around k4, or make some territory on
 the right or top.];W[hl];B[hk];W[jk];B[jm]C[b3b0p: want to divide white's teritory

He doesn't have much territory on the bottom though.  He's vunverable along th
e bottom.  Instead of cutting, invade.];W[im];B[il];W[hm];B[jl]
;W[kk];B[jn];W[jo];B[pj]C[That's pretty daring, but since white seems pretty loose on the bottom 
it's an okay risk to take.  Don't forget that you're still weak at j9 though.]
;W[mj];B[mh];W[ki];B[kg]C[That's a good appraoch.  While white tries to live, you build territory
 along the edges.];W[ii];B[hh];W[ik];B[pn]C[Q6 is too far away from the k6 group.  I suggest playing around m7 to b
oth threaten his l9 group and attempt to escape.  Your group can also expand d
ownwards because k5 is a pretty weak.];W[on];B[am]SQ[id][jm]
[pm]C[b3b0p: i want to surround the group here... is there any advice?

You can't do it, don't try.  No need to be greedy, you've got the lead already
.  You have 3 areas you need to focus on (see the squares).  First, the top ne
eds to be secured from an invasion, something you can't do in one move.  Secon
d, you need to extend Q6 upwad to keep the right safe.  Finally, you can look 
for a way to save Q6, or at least use it to secure territory elsewhere.]
;W[an];B[ak];W[al];B[lo];W[bk];B[aj];W[bl];B[ci]C[Because you had to play C11, the KO you created only ends up hurting yo
u.  Starting a KO can be very helpful, but it didn't end up letting you play m
5 in sente this time :(.  As you get better at reading out sequences, you'll b
e able to see when it'll work and when it won't.];W[ih];B[ko]
;W[in];B[jp];W[io];B[kp];W[kl]C[This move by white seemed odd to me.  My first instinct would've been t
o play L6.  After trying out that move, though, I found that it gets really co
mplicated.  I suggest that you try it out and see what you can find when you h
ave some free time, it's pretty neat.];B[kn];W[lm]
(;B[mo]C[b3b0p: want to connect to the right side..

It'd be more worthwhile to try and create an independent shape instead of conn
ecting.  Something like h3 is a good place to start.  If you must try and go r
ight, though, you should've palyed o5 instead.];W[no];B[po]

You were going to get invaded on the top eventually, and it'd take multiple mo
ves to secure it.  Use this 3x3 invasion to strengthen the top so that this'll
 be his last invasion.];B[cd];W[dc]

You can't kill it :(.  This is joseki, so be familiar with it.]

He doesn't need to do a fancy invasion actually.  Look at H18.  Secure that an
d you're safe though.]
