C[Hello!
I played this game on KGS. I play w, and won, but only by b's mistake in the end. I check score before invasion and it was B +22

I add some variations, where i can find better way. (or not?...)


Sorry for my bad English))

No problems. I am Lovro Furjanic from Croatia. I am an EGF 4.kyu. I will do your review. My comments are starting with LF:
I add variations so you should explore them. I use open sgf, the pandanet program for viewing .sgf so maybe you should also use it. Also, I cannot guarantee that my variations or ideas are correct, so you should thin kabout everything you read or see here. You should analyse every position. That is how you will get stronger. Lets get started.]
;B[dd];W[cp];B[qd];W[pq];B[kc]C[LF: This is the low variant of the Chinses opening. The high one would be at L16.]
(;W[pg]LB[pj:c][qo:b][dj:a]C[I see this move in other games, where b play Low Chinese.
I like to play Low Chinese by black, but what best move by white? A,B,C or W6 is ok?

LF:There are a lot of variations, please explore them all.]
(;B[oe]C[LF: Strange move.]
(;W[qk]C[Maybe a little too wide.];B[cm]LB[eq:A][fq:B][fp:C]
[ep:D]C[LF:Also a bit strange. A-D are normal approaches, altough C is very very rare.]
(;W[ci]C[LF: A pincer is needed or he will gat a big side. But maybe this is too wide.]
;B[cg]C[A good move.]
(;W[ck]C[Not good. This one is too narrow, but it doesnt grant safety to your stones.]

(;W[kq]LB[jq:a]C[A is better?

LF: Yes, This is too narrow.];B[ip];W[gp]C[LF: No. Dont start another fight. You have weakness around R11. You need one omre move to settle E11 group. You dont need one more weak group.]
(;B[go]C[LF: Bad move.];W[hp];B[ho];W[iq];B[fp];W[jp]
(;B[in]
(;W[gl]C[Bad move. E9 is nice if you want to kill these stones.]
;B[fl];W[ek];B[fk];W[ej];B[gm]C[He punished you correctly.]
;W[do]C[LF: Way too small. I like D17 better.];B[eo]C[A pass would be a better move than this. It does nothinh at all. Maybe secure 2 points of territory.]
;W[hl]C[Not good. Rather invade at D17.]
(;B[hm];W[il];B[kn]C[You could have made a good moyo here before this.]
;W[jo];B[jn];W[jd]C[I like this move, but now it is better not to make weak group and ply D17.]
;B[jc];W[id];B[ic];W[ig]C[Great result for you. He missed the chance to attack two of your weak groups.]
