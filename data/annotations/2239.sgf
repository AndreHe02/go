AB[dd][pd][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

I am Thomas and played white in this game, which I lost by 10 Points.
The rank of me and my opponent is valid on the Dragon Server, mine should be about 15k on IGS.
I wrote some comments into the file, in situations I find especially interesting or where I was not sure what to do.
I would be glad if you could tell me where I could have played better, or where I was thinking wrongly.

Many thanks in advance for your effort.]PL[W];W[dp];B[jp];W[qj]
;B[qf];W[pn]LB[ql:A]C[A might be an interesting for black to start a fight here if he felt Q6 was too loose.]

(;B[qo]LB[np:B][nq:A]C[This move seems to help white to get settled. Better A or B?]
;W[qn];B[np];W[jc];B[gc];W[mc]LB[mc:A][nc:B]C[Maybe better on the 4th line like at the right side?
Would you prefer A or B here? (I'm afraid of B because of a possible invasion.)
A seems correct here.  Black is very strong in this area TH]
;B[oc]LB[cf:A]
(;W[cj]LB[cf:A][hq:B][lq:C]C[Better around A or B?
I think A is better since B removes the possibility of invading at C TH]
;B[cg]LB[cc:C][fc:D][cf:B][ej:A]C[A may be good here, threatening B or C]
;W[gq];B[cl]LB[lp:B][lq:A]C[black is vulnerable at A or B. TH]
;W[ej]LB[ej:A]C[I'm always uncertain how to handle such invasions.
A Proverb says that a one-point-jump like A is never wrong. Is this true in this case, or do you know something better?
White doesnt want to become heavy here.  The jump is probably OK TH]
;B[el]LB[gj:B][cn:A]C[I think A or B now.  TH];W[eg]LB[cp:A]
C[I decided to play in this direction, that my thin lower left corner comes not under pressure.]
;B[gk]LB[fk:A]C[cutting at A might be interesting]
(;W[df];B[cf];W[de];B[ce];W[ed];B[dc]C[Cutting might be interesting for white.  TH]

(;W[ec];B[dg]C[I think this was not good played by white; now I can't keep my stones connected.
You must give something to get something, can't have it all.  TH]
;W[ff];B[co];W[cp];B[eh]
(;W[fh];B[ei];W[fi];B[fj];W[hd]LB[me:A]C[Should I have surrounded this stone in a larger scale, e. g. by playing around A?
Black can still pull that stone out easily or get something for it.  So maybe A is better.  TH]

(;B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[id];B[fe];W[gf]LB[ee:A]C[A may be good for black.  TH]

(;B[fd];W[ee]LB[eb:A]C[A connects up the black stones.  TH]
;B[md];W[ld];B[qh];W[me]C[should I have played at the right side or the bottom instead?]
;B[nh];W[lg];B[ig]LB[eb:D][gi:A][li:C][jj:B][ql:F][lq:E]TR[he]
C[I suppose black should better play from the outside insted of trying to rescue the marked stone, maybe A, B or C.
Depends.  If black is aware of the connection a D then perhaps this is interesting.  B or C starts to build a moyo but white can enter it from the right or can invade at E.  White is also weak at F]
;W[jh]
(;B[hh]LB[ih:A][gi:B];W[gj];B[fk];W[hi];B[fp];W[eq]C[Better at f3, I think
Yes, thicker.];B[ql]LB[rl:A]C[placing a sacrifice stone at S8 may give a better result for white since black has P9 in the line you followed.]

(;W[pk]C[I tried to capture the invading stone, but failed. Could it have been done, or should I have tried something different?]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[rl];W[rn];B[rj];W[ri]C[P9 for black, threatens to separate the white stones]

;W[hr];B[jr];W[hk]TR[he][ig][hh]C[I was glad to play this move, to enlarge my center group and connect to the right side (and surround the marked black stones more securely).]

TR[in][kn][lq][nr][pr]C[At the end black gets much territory around the marked points. Should I have invaded this area now or earlier? It seems it was not so good to let black build the wall ABC.
The last two white moves were pretty small.  Also white missed opportunities to invade at M3 earlier.
If black plays E18 at any time the bame is over.];W[db]C[finally!]

(;W[ni];B[qc]LB[qc:A]C[Was an invasion around A possible by white, or was this black move superfluous?
I tried this  back on move 91, looks hopeless.  But if you are ahead play carefully  :-)]
