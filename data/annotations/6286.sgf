C[Hi, this is my first review request, so please let me know if there is anything I should add in future requests to make your job easier. Basically I want to improve my entire game, so please comment on anything you see --particularly direction of play and invading, shape, life/death, and anything else. Thanks in advance!

Hi, I'm Agilis of KGS, and I'll be reviewing your game. I'll primarily focus on black, but will comment on points of interest along the way. I'll also tag my comments to distinguish from any existing comments.]

(;B[dp]C[[Agi\] This is a dubious move that isn't joseki. Some reasons why it is suspect to follow.

The probably the simplest joseki that would follow is in the variation.]
;W[cp]TR[do]C[[Agi\] First, it forces white to connect at C4, which is a move white wants.

Second, white instantly gets good shape, in the form of hane at the head of two. The fact that black forced himself into such a position makes it even more depressing.

More follows in the variations]
(;B[hp]C[[Agi\] This feels too far.

Alternatively...]
(;W[lp]C[[Agi\] White is being too hasty here. the top is still wide open. and E5 is still very important]

[Agi\] Dealing with this stone takes alot of reading ability, or going by feel. Here, you're either going to try to kill that white stone, or if white cross-cuts,there'll be some kind of trade

point A is somewhat more conservative but still many possibilities for trading, B and C also.

However, that top left group is alive, but doesn't have much potential to make you any territory, because white is alive and strong all around it. In that case, so long as it doesn't die, there are better moves around like D-G]

[Agi\]
In summary, black had a few major issues.

The most important was that black forced white to cut him on numerous occasions. White obliged. Black's position collapsed.

Black is focusing on very small exchanges, things that are worth only a few points, when there are entire groups with no eyes on the board yet. The white group on the right side was a prime example.

If a group is alive, there is no need to "grow" from it to take territory, it means your hands are free to ignore any white plays in the area near the live group. You can attack weak white stones (like using M16) and profit from it.]

;W[dn]LB[ep:C][jq:A][dr:B]TR[en][fo][fp][fq]C[[Agi\] However, this just force white to make even more profit, and on the 4th line now.

And black has more problems. The turn at A is pretty valuable to white, with D16 there, and the 3 black stones so weak, black can't resist.

B and C are two weaknesses that black has hanging over his head. 

Protecting any of the weaknesses at the triangles leaves white the opportunity to exploit the others if she so chooses.The other option would be to give 2 or more stones up, which is a high price to pay early in the game.

The weaknesses can help a white invasion at A later also.
