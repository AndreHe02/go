;B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[po];B[pl];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qm]
;B[ql];W[np];B[mq];W[mp];B[lq];W[nq];B[nr];W[lp];B[kp];W[ko]
;B[jp];W[dq];B[jo];W[kn];B[nl]C[This move seems too slow, the white stones aren't really in any danger and if they were this wouldn't be such a severe attack anyway ... it would be better to ignore these stones for now and come back to them later depending on what happens later ... beginners often attack to early and too hard I think.]
;W[nc];B[mn];W[om]C[This is dangerous for white ... I think black might be able to cut directly, not sure though.]
;B[ol]C[Too cowardly ... I don't think black really had to answer, and if black does, then a more agressive move would be better.]
;W[rm];B[oo]C[Doesn't seem to be a real threat ... white can just play Q4 ... black should cut at M5 before it's too late ... very severe move.]
;W[op]C[Mistake for white ... Q4 better if he wants to connect directly.]
;B[pp];W[on];B[lo]C[Total overplay at this point, black has just gotten way too greedy and lost all of his gain.  R5 followed by S5 would have been plenty big enough ... huge point gain in the corner and the remaining white stones still wouldn't be completely alive.  white can now play O or M6]
;W[ln];B[nn];W[no];B[mo];W[rk]C[seems too loose ... simply S8 is better I think.]
;B[kd]C[Now I think black should keep the pressure on the weak white group, starting with S8]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe]
;W[rg];B[og];W[ph];B[cf]C[F17 works better with top right black stones.]
;W[qb]C[Seems to be bad timing for white ... Q18 would be better anyway.]
;B[dj]C[Again F17 looks better to me.];W[ni]C[I don't really understand this move, don't know what to say about it.]
;B[rl]C[Too late for this now.];W[sl];B[qj];W[pj]C[This is very strange ... again I don't understand it and don't know what to say.]
;B[qk];W[rj];B[ri];W[sm];B[qh];W[qg];B[mk]C[Not necessary yet, if at all.]
;W[mh]C[Another move I don't understand at all ... I can't see any point to it.  White should worry about eyes on the bottom right.]
;B[rr];W[ro];B[pb]C[The lower right is much bigger ...];W[lc]
C[White should make eyes in the lower right ... this doesn't even help here ... just makes black stronger.]
;B[me]C[L17 was better ...];W[ld];B[kf];W[jc]C[I think L17 was better ...]
;B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[gq];W[bo]C[Way too small ... I still think black can kill the lower right ... should at least try.]
;B[hc]C[Don't like this one.  F17 better, lower right best]
;W[id];B[ge];W[hd];B[gd];W[fc]C[White should cut not peep ...]
;B[gc];W[be];B[if];W[le];B[lf];W[he];B[hf];W[gf];B[ec]C[Maybe F18 instead ...]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[ed];B[kb];W[kc];B[jb];W[lb];B[jd]C[Mistake ... J17 is better.]
;W[ib];B[ic];W[ob];B[qa];W[ka];B[rb];W[rh];B[qi]C[Mistake ... T11 first ...]
;W[ki]C[BIG mistake ... T11 is REALLY huge now.];B[oh]C[T11]

;B[nk]C[T11];W[lj];B[kk]C[This doesn't work ... white can still cut starting with M7]
