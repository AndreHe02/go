C[Hi, I am Jason. I will try to help you on this game. Let's start!


OK Brief intro:

We are both beginners.

White has spent a little more time studying and reading than black has.

Black is better at local fighting.
White is better at the big picture.

We both  overlook lots of important small things.

Mostly I'd guess we both need to play more games...but maybe you could point out some main things to work on for both of us.

Also if you have any guess to a ranking for either of us that'd be helpful so we could tell people who ask our strength and don't want to give us any handicap stones when we sorely need them.

Thanks,

;W[kc];B[jq];W[qj]LB[oc:a][od:b]TR[jj]C[B: I have no idea what is good or bad about any of this.. And where should I play next?

For white:
You can easily get about 20 points if you play at a. But now black can invade your corner with a or b, or takes good advantage with K11.]
;B[cf]C[B: What's better than this?

k11, p16 or p17 are both good.];W[rn];B[ro]C[This move is too close to white. s4 is better.]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[qp];B[pq];W[rq];B[bd];W[cc];B[cd]C[This move is not necessary. Black is quite safe here. If you want to attack white, e17 is better.]
;W[ec];B[qq];W[sp];B[qn]
(;W[so]C[W: The right move?

See the variation.];B[pn];W[qm];B[ol];W[pm];B[om];W[on];B[po]
;W[nn]C[W: are teh two white stones vluable her or should i have kept black to move north with p7 and p8?

It is not easy to save the white group. Try another way.];B[mp]
;W[cn]C[There is a good way to attack white.]
(;B[fq];W[cp];B[cq];W[cl]C[B: How do I attack his base?
See the variation.]
(;B[bk];W[bp];B[bq]
(;W[np]C[W: The right direction? or maybe p10 or m6?

I think this way is ok. But, m6 is good, too.];B[nq];W[mo];B[co]
;W[bo];B[do];W[lp];B[mq];W[dn]LB[ek:a][bm:b]C[W: this seemed important to me--is it?

white group is safe. You can try a to escape, or b to make eyes.]
;B[oo];W[fn]C[For white, n7 is very important, right?];B[mm]
;W[ln];B[mn];W[no]C[This move is bad. l5 will be better.];B[ko]

(;W[jo]C[W: this was obviously the wrong move but where is the right one?

See the variation.];B[lo]C[B: Would white L4 be good influence towards center for me?

W: which is why i play L6 cause i want the center?  or should i forget the center and attack him more seriously?
I end up with signif territory in the center but the proverb is that there isn't any on the center?]
;W[kn];B[kp];W[jp];B[kq];W[jm];B[pf];W[od];B[pe]C[For black:
Not good move. you are helping white enclose his corner.];W[pd]
;B[rg]C[For black:
Not good move, either. Escape outside will be better.];W[oj]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[ql];W[rl];B[pl];W[re]LB[nf:a][ef:b]C[W: whats the right move for me here--I didn't feel like losing hte two stones was a big deal so i picked this move....whats bigger now?

a to attack black, or b to make big moyo.];B[ri];W[rj];B[rm]
;W[sm]C[For white:
o13 is more useful. you can attack black group.];B[qm];W[qk]
;B[nh]C[B: Can I be more aggressive?

your stones are not safe yet. you will be danger with white playing at p13. so, o13 will be better.]
;W[mj];B[lk];W[ph];B[pg];W[ff]C[W: am i leaving the situation on the right side too soon?

I don't think so. This move is good.];B[nj];W[ni];B[nk];W[mi]
;B[oh];W[oi];B[ki];W[mh];B[mf];W[me];B[mg];W[ng];B[og];W[nf]
C[W: stupid move for me here...but i got lucky...he didn't respond at O15
Where should I have played?

I will play at o15. Then you can take black stones on right side easily.]
;B[kg]C[B: Inattentiveness due to a focus on defense is often my downfall.]
;W[ne];B[qh]
(;W[jf]C[See the variation.];B[rf];W[qr]LB[jk:a][ek:b]C[W: obviously this is too small for this point in the game and its gote--where shold i have played?

a or b can expanse your territory.];B[pr];W[rr];B[kf];W[ke]
;B[qe];W[sd];B[qi]C[W: I wasn't thinking about killing this black group centered at R15 but later on it looked like i prob could have had i tried--should i have been trying earlier than i did?  WHere?

;B[aa];W[fi];B[fc];W[gh];B[fb];W[ab];B[de];W[aa];B[ed]C[this seems to be the killer move?

There was no any way to kill white without white's wrong move.]

So, you miss the chance, see?];W[da];B[ef];W[ic];B[ee];W[fa]

;B[gd];W[hc];B[fo];W[go];B[fp];W[jk]C[Good move. White get the left center. That's the key point.]
;B[ih];W[hf];B[if]C[B: I need to stop worry about connecting things like this...it ultimately leads to big loss for me.]

you save one stones, but lose more.];W[jg];B[jh];W[ii];B[hg]

;B[nm];W[hn];B[ho];W[gm];B[gp];W[eo]C[W: The wrong move? i lose sente...]
;B[ep];W[en];B[gn]C[B: I should have ignored the ko to maintain sente.]
;W[hm];B[go];W[si]C[W: this is when i first thought i might be able to kill this group--but then i failed...

yes. you ever had the chance. not now.];B[sh];W[sf];B[sg];W[pi]
C[W: i should have realized i failed by now...

Finally you win the game, right?];B[ap]C[B: This is endgame now, right? So I go to push into white to take away territory one at a time?

I'm sorry, but i don't understand your question.];W[ao];B[aq]
;W[ps];B[os];W[or]C[W: I read one too many books on the throw in tesuji and didn't quite understand it all... : (

It's hard to take a example. Maybe next time.];B[qs];W[rs];B[ps]
