C[Hi. I'm Shashwat, and I played White.

This game was played at FlyOrDie.com, so I don't know the rating of my opponent, but I'd place him at roughly 12-16 kyu. He was ready to give me a handicap to start, but i wanted a fair game.

I have an IGS rating of 17kyu, but I feel I'm worse than that, so I'd be around 18-19kyu.

Hey I'm felix37, mostly play offline now and don't really know my rank - probably around 8-10k. I'll make some comments where I see some stuff.]

;B[nq];W[cm]C[not necessary - if he approaches on either side you can extend the other side]
;B[dg];W[eg]C[In the exchange that follows, I feel I could have done better.

-- 

no need to be so aggressive - K17 would be fine here... instead of confronting D13, just use the fact it's alone to try to force him to do what you want later as he tries to save it]
;B[di];W[dj];B[ch];W[eh];B[ei]C[at this point he's already escaped to the middle - you can't completely smother the stone, so if he takes the middle escape route you should be able to gain advantage on the flipside - taking away the base of the group, or linking your two stones to the ones above whilst continuing to add a little pressure, i.e. D14]

(;B[ej];W[ee];B[bo];W[bn];B[co];W[ek];B[dk];W[dl]C[Is C9 a better move than D8?

--

yeah, black D9 puts your two stones in atari with little hope for escape - instead you want to ensure your group is alive so you don't have to fight to protect it. C9 helps establish a base for your stones along the side]
;B[ck];W[bj];B[bk];W[bh];B[bi];W[aj]C[these stones were dead a while ago]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[ah];W[ak];B[al];W[bl];B[ai];W[am];B[ak];W[em]
;B[cn];W[dm]C[not necessary. check out K17, thats worth loads of points.  Q6 wouldbe nice to make two of your stones relatively safe & alive too.  E7 is defending the cutting points here so no need to play D7.

you are being led into playing in the areas black wants to play in by following the last move - go is a war, not just a battle, so try to get the upper hand in some of the other battles on the board instead]
;B[fk];W[el]C[defending this is worth 2 points?  you probably need to run out to the middle with this group if you want it to live, e.g G7, or H7 if it works (have a read)]
;B[fl];W[fm];B[fg];W[de];B[fh];W[he]C[better, but a slow move, better to extend further, to run with G7/H7, or Q6 to defend two easily attackable stones.]
;B[lc]C[this i probably where you should've played - an opponents vital point is your vital point]
;W[jd]C[again you are simply responding to his moves.  if every move you play is a response to the opponent's, you will lose]
;B[jc];W[ic];B[jb];W[gc]C[nothing wrong with J18];B[ib];W[hb]
;B[kd];W[je];B[ke];W[jf]C[black manages to build a wall facing his territory, thus securing masses of points, and you play along with his ideas]
;B[kf];W[jg];B[kg]C[Here I have effectively given him the Top-Right. Were there any other possibilities?

--

always try to split your opponents weak groups/stones, and connect yours.  instead you struggle to run away with weak groups and make small extensions to your massive groups]
;W[nk]C[you need to make a drastic invasion here to stand any hope of winning the game - either by attacking Q16 or R12, probably by touching the stones or another aggressive attack]
;B[ni];W[li]C[what is the aim of this move? no need to connect to the top left, doesn't secure you any territory, doesn't threaten the opponents groups, only invites him to strengthen his outer wall further]
;B[mh];W[lh];B[lg]C[he happily obliges];W[kh];B[oo];W[qn];B[pp]
;W[qp]C[the game is already lost by now so I'll do some summary comments here.

you continue to do as your opponent wishes for the rest of the game.. earlier on you should be more aggressive. especially in the beginning of the game, try to create a few small but stable groups, whilst preventing your opponent from joining his small groups together (or extending an already large territory).

you seem to have forgotten entirely about the group on the bottom left which desperately needs to run for life.  perhaps you would benefit from taking a step back and looking at the game as a whole more often, rather than focusing on the small moves, think big.

hope this has helped, best of luck with future games

My opponent told me that I attack too little. How can I improve my attacking? Also, what other aspects can I improve at? Where should I focus? How was my defending?
Thanks.])
