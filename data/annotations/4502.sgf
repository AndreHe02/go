AB[pd][dp]C[dear reviewer, thank you very much for your time!
i put in some variations , which all start with:
s? meaning slow2go asking.

Hello, I'll be doing this review ^^ I tried to comment a bit for both players, but I mainly focused on your moves, I hope it's fine with you. Well, enjoy !

(;B[dj]C[This move is of course okay and can't be faulted, however, it lets white set the pace of the game (taking gote after move 8) : this is never a desirable thing in a handicap game, no matter how small the handicap is.]
;W[fq];B[hq]
(;W[dn]
(;B[eo]C[This move isn't joseki and pro consider it to be wrong. The reason is that there is a shape problem around G4 (the gap is too wide) and this problem need to be taken care of with one more move.

See variation for some of the most common josekis arising from this position.]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[Blocking from this side isn't usual (usually, you block from the side where you made the pincer), but since you have a stone at D10, this is good.]
;W[dq];B[gp]C[Now the shape problem is obvious, there is a lot of aji left in the cut of the keima.]

;W[ag];B[df];W[aj];B[gn]C[Protecting the cut now may be good timing, but the vital point for attack is H7. The problem is of course the previous move of E4.]
;W[hl]TR[hq][iq][jq]SQ[dk][dl][cm][dm][fm][dn]C[s? i thought until now the development on the left was in my favor as i had a good wall, a save group pressing down white
and a white group to attack later :)

Sure, white attachement at H2 and then the crawling was meaningless. Making a living group around C12 is a result too bad for words. Wasn't it Lee Chang Ho who said that it's better to die than to live small ? (Invasion and Reduction, volume 1) : This game is as good as won !]

(;B[gr]C[s? this resulted in gote so probably was no good

Yes, this is bad because it misses the point of this game : as you just stated, you have a wall, a safe group and a group to attack ! I guess it's obvious that it's about time you make white suffers :)]
;W[fr];B[gq];W[bq];B[bp];W[ep];B[do];W[nq]
(;B[kd]C[This move is too slow. It neither use the weakness at Q9 nor the weakness of the H8 group. This move seems a bit "territory hungry", this isn't a really good way to use neither your thickness nor your handicap (For a very good introduction to Handicap Game spirit, please read "Kage's secret chronicle of handicap go")]
;W[pl]C[The game is still in black favor, but black's option have already diminushed : white had some free time to protect one of his two weaknesses.]

;W[om];B[nm];W[mo];B[nj];W[lj];B[oi];W[pj];B[og]C[This result is very "good" for white if we compare to what he had before. He didn't lose a single point on the side, but he got thicker inthe center. The value of the M10 stone is huge. If he gets to play L9, you'll lose a lot of points..If we look at what you would have had by just playing L7 right away, the difference is clear.]

Yes, because of the aji in the corner. This is black privilege tho (it means that white won't waste a move to play here too soon in the yose). You could (should) have played it earlier, before the privilege disappear.

You took that, and you also got to reduce the corner to 2 pts instead of 10 ! You lost J13 in exchange. That's why J13 wasn't so big, actually, you gained 4-5 pts in this sequence it seems. The game is getting close...Funny how yose can change everything if you aren't careful :)]
