AB[pd][dp]C[Hi. Sorry for taking so long, I got caught up in the organisation of my local go team and my monitor broke down... well I have a notebook for this now so let's start.

For this review I assume you know what gote, sente and hane is, if not you should look it up on senseis library:
http://senseis.xmp.net

Alcibaides [13k\]: hi, gl
frescacho [11k\]: hi

Hi, here's my game. I've had trouble lately with a new class of opponent. I am a territorial Go player. I've always had some trouble with unreasonable opponents who overplay attacks. Lately, I've moved to a level where they are giving me fits. I win as many or more battles than I lost but even when I win, the resulting shape is horribly deformed and sometimes I have given up a lot of territory. This was a game against the guy who may have been the best at it. Any comments are welcome but mostly, I'd like advice on how to kill opponents who overplay or how to use it to my advantage by claiming more open space. I get dragged into these battles and it really isn't my style.]

(;B[ed]C[I honestly didn't know what to do with an attachment. My thought was to get thickness at E 16 and make a base. Was that correct?

It is ok, but keeping him out of the corner is a good idea so he has to struggle for life while you can take profit.]
;W[nd]C[this is weak by white];B[pf];W[nf];B[lf];W[hc]C[I feel like I should have been able to kill this stone, he can't make a base from there easily]

(;B[gc]TR[hd][he]C[Mistake number one. In retrospect, I should have capped at H 15 or H 16 shouldn't I?

This is completely wrong. You never attach a weak stone it makes your opponent fix his position.]

The way the stones were placed in the beginning I thought I was going to win. I was very surprised around move 115 when I realized how badly it was going. He wanted to fight, I was fighting well. He was managing to twist my position and get just enough to live ugly and reduce my position. I'm facing more of these guys but he is the best. If you could help me focus globally on proper reactions and locally on battle tactics for overplayed positions, I would appreciate it.

I think your problems are very local. You need to learn about good shape. 

You should read this article
http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&page=HaneAtTheHeadOfTwoStones

and 
http://senseis.xmp.net/?PushingFromBehind

Those two should help a great deal with you choice of moves.
Move 108 for example if a move that leads to pushing from behind. Move 14 as well left a weakness that cost you a lot later on even though it looks alright earlier.

I think a lot can be said about any game but I think but just avoiding a simple mistake you did quite a couple of times in this game will make you stronger. Then you can come back for a review that is more about direction. 
Hope this helped a bit.
