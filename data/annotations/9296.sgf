C[Hello, my name is Evan, I played white in this game.  I've added a few questions to certain moves.

Thank you in advance for your review!

No problem, sorry for the long wait.];B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[cq]
;B[ic];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj]C[Trying to develop a rapidly.];B[dp]

(;W[cp]TR[qp]C[Was this the correct side to push?

As a rule of thumb, D3 is the correct direction.

Crawl towards the direction with the colour of your stones (R4).]
;B[do];W[er]
(;B[co];W[fp]LB[cj:A]C[Black A maybe more balanced.];B[dk]C[Now you actually help black to develop the left side.]

(;W[op]C[Maybe it's too slow to try to make a competing moyo?]
;B[og];W[qc]LB[ph:A][qd:B]C[Unsure if this was a good direction..

Well, if you answer at A, black will defend at B, so R17 still very timely.]
;B[qd];W[rd]
(;B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[nb];W[oc];B[nc];W[rf];B[se];W[pc]
LB[qi:A][sf:B][ed:C]C[Even if white play A, black still can reduce a bit at B.

so in fact R12 is a slow move, not really urgent now, developing top left should be priority now.

Black C is in fact very urgent.];B[qh]
(;W[ed]C[I wonder whether there's a better way to invade the moyo..]

(;B[ec]C[This is a bad move.

The left side is more empty, black should develop there.];W[dd]
;B[dc];W[ce];B[fd]
(;W[bd]C[This is bad move, you should cut at C17.];B[cc];W[ci]
LB[cf:A]C[Felt like I was hitting some key points, but maybe this is too dangerous?

The 2 dan has show you that A is the critical move to initiate an attack.]
;B[cf]
(;W[be];B[df];W[bf];B[de];W[cg];B[dg];W[dh];B[bj];W[ee]C[Foolish?

Yes, no much benefit sacrificing extra stone like this.];B[ff]
;W[jd]LB[bh:A][jf:B]C[Maybe over-reacting? Would it be better to try something like N11?

Black A is very severe again, that is why I suggested C12 instead of D12 for white previously.

Black can consider capping at B, he is being gentle here.];B[id]
;W[jf];B[kd]
(;W[jc]C[Overplay.];B[kc];W[of]TR[rf][qf]C[Trying to achieve something tricky here..

Well, bad idea in fact, better to let the 2 marked stones rest in peace.]
;B[nf];W[jp]LB[bi:A]C[Good move, but A can be very urgent.]
;B[cj];W[bh]C[Thought it would be good to make life quickly and simply.

Yes, this is good move.

Again, black is being gentle, he can play B12 to attack.];B[lq]
;W[jq]C[a good attacking move? Or should I play around m5?

I think this move is okay.

If you make a wall here, black can live by the side quite comfortably.]
;B[or];W[qr]C[Too submissive? I wondered about points like o3 or even n2.

This is okay.];B[lo];W[mp]C["Make him heavy before attacking" - sensible? Or is it aji keshi?

Good move.];B[lp]
(;W[jn]C[Maybe m7 would have been fiercer?

Yes, I agree with you.];B[kr];W[lm]C[felt right, but...

K2 better, protect your territory while attacking.];B[jr];W[nn]
LB[rj:A][jr:B]C[Is white achieving success, or missing the point?

The right side isn't that big due to the reduction at A.

You should answer at B.];B[hq];W[ri]C[Is this move more endgame than midgame?

This is good move.];B[rh];W[ng]LB[je:A][jb:B]C[I'm aiming at K18, but maybe it's an impossible dream to get that move.  I was hoping to get enough support that I could eventually play K18, black  k15, white L15

Getting K18 is mission impossible, just assume it is white A and black B.

This is where you start to lose the game.];B[nh];W[mg];B[oe]

(;W[pg];B[pf];W[ph]C[Seemed like profit, but maybe it's nothing really...]
;B[oh];W[pi]LB[qg:A][sf:B]C[White A, black can play B to connect, so here black can tenuki, white get nothing.]
;B[li]C[This is winning move.];W[en]LB[dm:A]C[I don't know.  this doesn't look very good, does it?

Black just need to answer at A, winning big...];B[fq];W[eq]
;B[ep];W[cm]LB[fo:A][fr:B]C[overplay?

You should exchange A for B first.];B[fm];W[em];B[bm];W[bn]
;B[cn]C[You missed a chance here.]
(;W[cl];B[bo];W[bl]C[I thought having an attack on the e9 stones would be good...]
;B[an];W[fo];B[fr]
(;W[ap]C[Proper defense?

Ko here, but your corner is way too thin...];B[al];W[ak];B[bk]
;W[am];B[dl];W[bn];B[dm];W[ao]C[I figured that even if black connects, I can attack the group as a whole.]
;B[dn];W[fl];B[fk];W[gl];B[gk];W[hk];B[hj];W[gj]C[This is complicated fighting.  I don't know!! What's the right thing to do?

Anyway, this is a losing game, so it is okay to pick up fight like this.]
;B[ek]
(;W[fi]C[I have a feeling this is a mistake.  Maybe g11 instead?]
;B[hl];W[ik];B[gm];W[hp]C[I can't connect immediately.];B[el]
;W[hn]C[Black still has just one eye..];B[il];W[jk];B[jl];W[ln]
C[But my stones are under attack as well :(];B[km];W[kn];B[ii]
;W[kk];B[ei];W[eh]
(;B[fh]
(;W[fg]C[Atari the wrong direction and this is the game.];B[gh]
;W[gg]C[Black has escaped, but I can at least get a few points in compensation..]
;B[hh];W[ef]C[But is this too small?

14 points is not really small but not enough to win the game.]
;B[fe];W[eg];B[hf];W[mj];B[mi];W[ji];B[jh];W[ki];B[kh]C[Black's top area has become huge.

Yes, because O13 cut and died.];W[hg];B[ig];W[gf];B[he];W[na]
;B[ma];W[oa];B[nj];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl];B[lj];W[ml]C[This was the las mistake.  Why not play M8 and connect unconditionally?

Yes...];B[kl]C[When I realized it's now a ko to connect my stones, I resigned.

You need to learn more about fighting and direction of play (study more pro games).

I hope you enjoy my review, sorry for the long wait as I have a busy work schedule.

Best regards,
