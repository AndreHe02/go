TM[1200]RE[B+Resign]US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[0.5];B[pd];W[dq]C[horangi 16k*: nice to meet you.  play well!
I'd be honored if you'd comment on this game I played today.  There  are three areas I'm particularly interested in:  The opening (first 50  moves or so), whether white's attack against black in upper right could  have been successful (obviously it *could* have, but try to pick optimal  play for both sides), and whether white could have lived on lower side.   Now if that's not a big enough request, feel free to comment on whatever  else you'd like.]

(;B[do];W[dl]C[a is simply wrong, b,c or d are all normal.]
(;B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[er]C[This continuation is why c3 is wrong.  White has settled quickly and easily, and black has nothing to show for his invasion.]
;B[fp]
(;W[gq];B[gp];W[hq]
(;B[cm]C[15 is sooo bad that white can even tenuki.  If you intended to cower with c7, why even start to try to settle at the expense of strengthening white with f4 and g4?]
;W[qn]C[16 is well placed, since there is nothing for either player on the bottom edge]

(;B[nq];W[rp];B[qq];W[qk];B[de];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch]C[This is not a great result for black, now the stone at d8 counts as an eraser, not a stone for territory, but perfectly placed to reduce blacks moyo.  Since white has no attack against this stone, c8 is a bad move.  Now is the time o16]
;W[cl]C[What is b7?  White can just ignore this.]
(;B[bm]C[Black is threatening to make say 4 points of territory down there. c10 is *very* bad.  Much better to ignore, and do d!]

(;W[cj]C[a isn't important, nothing is happening on the left side, regardless of what either player thinks.  Play a big point, like b.]

(;B[eh]C[a settles black, leaving no possibility of getting in, say c14.]

(;W[di];B[dh]
(;W[fk]C[White has gone far to make reality of the illusion of a weak white shape.  Because of his fear of being attacked, he has built a target for Black to attack.


a is the right dirrection, but leaves j17, an ideal place for a white stone.  Play k17.]
