C[To the reviewer.

I played white in this game, and won by a bare 2.5 points.

From what I can see from my review, there aren't any major blunders by either side. We both made a couple of minor goofs, but they about cancelled out. And we both got a "snake" into the other's territory but, again, I think they cancelled out.

So, this seemed like a good game to submit for pointers on general improved play. I'd mainly like to hear about missed opportunities or dangers that never materialized in the course of play. What would a better player have done to change the course of the game?]
;B[qc]C[Hi,

here is my 2 cents worth of review :)
i might not be correct, and i might made mistake. what i think, you need not to believe and accept. but let's learn together and have fun in discussing a game of go ;)

cheers,

[qi][qk][ql][qm][qn][qo][qp][qr][qs][qb][qa]C[** Black plays too low here. Yes, this can secure the territory at later time, but it's vulnerable to attack. It would lost control of the centre and the battle takes place in the centre of the board. White would be in the leading position if it can attack Black effectively. **]
;W[oc]C[** White can play at Q16 as well, as this is the common way to tackle R17. **]

C[I kind of changed horses in mid-stream here, deciding to take the bottom edge rather than separate black along the left side. After I got to looking at it I figured there was more room to develop along the bottom.

** i think it's normal to play until this stage, black takes the edge/corner, and u build the stron influence outside. **]
;B[bq]
(;W[kq]TR[qc][pe][qj][qq]C[** White 18 can play at Q4 as well, if the black still comes out with the response like upper right, then white would gain a lot at the bottom. Else, white still can weaken the black's group at the right side. See variation. **]
;B[np];W[nf];B[pg];W[ei]C[** P8 is a good point to attack Black. **]
;B[oj]TR[np][qq][qj][pg][pe][qc]C[** By playing at 23, Black looks stronger and has the opportunity to turn the mark area into its own territories. Yet, white is not bad too. Unless Black is able to break through to the centre of the board. **]

;W[kc];B[mh];W[nn]LB[kb:A]TR[kc][kd][ke]C[I guess I should have extended one more time (at A) before I left the top position? I undertook this whole line of play to take the territory along the top-center, but ended up losing it later on because of the shortage of liberties of the marked group. I presume he would have had to respond to it in order to seal off the upper-right side, so I would have kept sente and been able to continue as in the game.

** This would not be a problem since you have enough liberties for the marked group. At least now it is ok to leave them like that and play other points first, which is more important, but go back to the marked white group when the importance of it affect the whole game. Means that, you should know when is the time for you to go back to that group. **]

[fl:c]C[** White 54 can be played at somewhere else first, which would be more important than playing at  C5. the good points would be around the marked points on the board, in my humble opinion. As white 54 only help to secure black's territory at the left side. **]
;B[bo];W[en];B[dm];W[fj];B[fk];W[hk];B[gm]C[This starts a black incursion that consumes some territory that I felt like "should" have been mine.

** Indeed, if you are able to play at 61, there is a possibility to turn that area to be yours ;) **]

C[** Until here, i think these few moves is wasted. To play like this, you should have chances to play at else where instead. Both of u gain and lost nothing much, and this let black to take the leading role, as now he has the initiatives to play at else where first, therefore to take more advantage of you. **]
;B[rr]C[** Actually there's no need for black to seal here, as white would have no way to take over that territory, please examine carefully. **]
;W[ha];B[iq]C[** White should play at 167 instead before letting play at 167. then, when black reply white's 167 at J2, white can still play at 166. agree? **]

C[** I don't see any needs for black to play at here, this does not affect the game in my humble opinion. **]
;C[** There's nothing much i can say about this game, because there is not much counter attack in the game and it's strange that the game could ends up like this, each sides gains a piece of "land" from the board. As you can see, White is taking the area from top left to the centre and all the way to the bottom. while black take the right side and bottom left and right. It looks as if it is planned (i say as if). And if you can add in more counter attacks and variation in your moves, this game would be more attractive and "adventurous". As the counter-attacks and the use of strategies would make a game a masterpiece ;) 

to conclude, both of you play pretty careful and it's a territory fight to me. Though it's important to have more territory to win a game, but territory is not always the point. Winning a game is more on the confidence and the inner feeling of oneself. I don't know how to describe the feeling, but i can say, when you play more you surely would learn more. One thing i need to say is white has the advantages at the opening, as Black plays too low at the right side, which make become an easy-to-attack area. You would gain even more by attacking that area aggresively, but avoid close attack, as close attack is not always the best. 

I don't know whether you can understand what i said, but this is what i can see from the game, both of you should play more and learn more from other people's games. Try to think on the opponent side and think what will he do next. if i play like this, would he follow?or will he comes out with other ways? these are what we should count in. One more thing, when we play, we should always consider the surrounding area, whether it benefit us to play from here. or is it better to play the other way round?it's all depend on your overall ovservation and experience. Enjoy! Cheers :)
