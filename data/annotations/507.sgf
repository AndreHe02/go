C[Review by Karel Tavernier, 17-nov-97.];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[fq];W[iq];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ip];W[jp];B[io];W[mq]
C[Maybe o3 better.];B[oq]C[Please do realize the corner is still vulnerable, and the move
is definitely gote, there is no threat in this move.];W[gp]
;B[fp];W[hq];B[hp];W[gq];B[go]C[There is something strange in this line of play.  These seem
more endgame moves. As W keeps sente, it did not cost him, though.]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[qe]C[Again, this is gote.];W[cj]C[OK];B[fc]
C[Yes.];W[fd];B[gc]C[Joseki is g16.  Gettting higher wherever possible is important,
always, and here particularly because it works well with B top right
corner];W[gd]C[OK!];B[hd];W[ec];B[ic]C[j16.  If w cuts, he is in a ladder.]
;W[po]C[Maybe better around f7.  This builds a huge W moyo, and attacks
B position.  W must not be jealous, and leave B some territory. No need
for difficult invsions now.   If you want to attack here, play q6 or r6.
This acts as a pincer on r8, and threatens the corner: lots of fun.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pl];B[pm];W[om];B[qm];W[nm];B[on];W[oo]
;B[nn];W[no];B[mn];W[pk];B[np]C[No! This move serves NO purpose. Play n5. This squeezes the W
stones, and helps a connection with B group at f5.];W[mo];B[ln]
;W[mp];B[nr];W[op];B[nq];W[mr];B[qq];W[mc];B[oc];W[me];B[cg]
C[I would not invade so deeply.  This will create a very weak
group.  It may live, but you will pay a price to make it alive.  Better
invade at 3-3 in top left corner, and slightly erase black moy from the
outsidw, e10 or e13];W[ce];B[eg];W[dh]C[In general, do not play close to a cutting point.  This
strenghten you opponent.];B[dg]C[See?  B is stronger.];W[ej]
C[Very good. B is weak, and W is building territory by indirectly
covering against an invasion at d8.];B[md]C[If B loses sente, W at G 13 will hurt terribly.  B must run with
his weak group.  But for the moment, W must answer  Do not try to cut a
niken tobi early on.  W will get stronger.  p14 isolates him and damages
w moyo on right. l17  (k17) eliminates his eye space ans strengthens the
B group.  You do not need to kill a weak group to make profit.  Hunting
it makes profit elsewhere.];W[ld];B[nd];W[ke]C[Maybe better l16 or l17.]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[lb];W[mb]C[L18 It isolates and weakens B group on the left.]
;B[kb];W[jc];B[jb];W[ie];B[he];W[id];B[hb]C[h17 is better.  It is a false eye anyhow.]
;W[ff];B[fe];W[ge];B[ee];W[ef];B[df];W[de];B[fg];W[gf];B[if]
;W[hf];B[hc]C[See, I W sente now.];W[je];B[ig];W[hg]C[Good.]
;B[hh];W[gh];B[gg];W[ed];B[lf];W[kf];B[le];W[kg];B[kd];W[ih]
;B[hi];W[ii];B[hj];W[ij]C[No! f11!  This cuts the B stones, and will make B very nervous.]
;B[fi];W[fm];B[jd]C[Endgame move. Do not throw away sente for a miserable 4 points.]
;W[og];B[lg];W[ni]C[Hmm.  There must be more important things to do, attach a weak
black group for instance. This move attacks nothing, makes only small
territory, only defends a group that is already reaonably solid.]
;B[lh];W[ll]C[ok.];B[kh];W[jg];B[jh];W[jf];B[do]C[B really loves this type of move.]
;W[co];B[eo];W[em]C[B moves eliminated W weaknesses, and did NOTHING for B.  It is
not because a move is kikashi (opponent has to respond ) that it is a
good move.];B[br]C[ok];W[cr];B[cs];W[bq];B[ar];W[hn];B[ho];W[hm]
C[Useless gote sequence. W started a nice attack, and throws awy
sente.];B[gr];W[hr];B[er];W[bi]C[Continue attack on b group first, eg g1.  Also nice is Wb1 IF
Bd1 then Wa3 If Ba1 also Wa3 B in deep trouble.];B[hs];W[is]
;B[gs];W[jr]C[f1 steals B eyes in sente];B[kq]C[Nice!];W[jq]
;B[kr];W[ms]C[l4 only chance.  B cannot connect underneath anyhow.]
;B[kp];W[jo];B[ko];W[jn];B[ds]C[b1.  If w plays at b1, tye eye is still gone.]
;W[ks];B[fs];W[km];B[mm];W[ml];B[nl];W[ol];B[nk];W[mj];B[qk]
