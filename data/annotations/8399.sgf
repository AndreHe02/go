C[is a pincer here ok? unfortunately after the move, I couldn t remember the right follow ups. can you help?

Well, the pincer is OK, but THAT pincer is not very understandable for me. This is the rare and poorly explored pincer of all.
I would prefer moves of A, B or at least C, because the squared stone puts the pincer stone in tense position.]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[pc];W[re];B[of]LB[ic:B][qg:A]C[The joseki continues at A. You should look at this sequence.
But I like your attitute to not give black an opportunity to attack the top. Though B was more prefferable.]
(;W[fc]LB[ic:A]C[Not good move because your stone can be easily splitted.]
;B[ic]LB[fe:A]C[Black follows the proberbs: "My opponents best move is the best of mine" and "Play at the center of simmetry"
I don't see good sequence for white, but A has to be noticed.]

C[as a result now, whites group is closed in

This is the cost of your jumps. Thats all started form m17.]

Here is no good attack at the kakari stone, so you need to defend]

Black just tries his best to get out. His stones are very weak.]

Very good move. Though A could make a match to that.];B[hq]

I will end here.

The main thing to do for you is - DIRECTION FEELING. You need to look at the whole 361 points at the board to be ready to make your next move. The josekis are secondary for you, but some of them you must look through over and over.

Thank you.

Could you please give general comments on the opening an the beginning middle game? Thank you :)]
