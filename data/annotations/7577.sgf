C[Hello Richard,

Thank you for sending the game to the GTL. I am a Belgian 2 dan, KGS 3 dan. My comments are preceded with "dv".

Dieter Verhofstadt];B[pq]C[In some games I see gaping mistakes that I made and I can tell where I had a chance to win the game.  Nothing jumps out like that in this game.  I have reviewed and looked for some of my mistakes.   Please let me know your ideas for these suggestions and other areas you see.

And it would be interesting if you could explain a couple of his mistakes and how I did not capitalize on them.
----------
dv: Please read my conclusion at the end of the game first, for a major overview. Throughout the game I'll comment on a few minor issues.]

;W[pf];B[jd];W[pl]
(;B[qj]C[Is this too small for me to jump in now?

dv: It is too early to invade. White has invested a lot of stones in this area, so it is more interesting for Black now to build on the left or bottom side. After that is done, the right can be invaded. If White puts yet another stone on the right, his investments will turn out to be overconcentrated, compared to Black's development on left and bottom.]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[nf];B[qh]C[dv: A good move for stability];W[rf]
(;B[oh]C[dv: This is too slow. White has responded to Black's base move, so now it is time to take the initiative. See variation.

Black surely lives this way, but the stones are overconcentrated.]
;W[rq]C[dv: This is a very good move by White, stabilizing his weakest group in a big fashion and destabilizing Black.]
;B[lq];W[lf]C[dv: This on the other hand is a purposeless move]
;B[ld]C[dv:
To which you respond by connecting bigtime!];W[nl]C[dv: Somehow White has set out to surround your alive group.]
;B[mh]LB[li:A][ri:B]C[dv: This is again slow. A is a faster way to get out. In any case, Black is not in danger as he will always live by playing B.]
;W[ng];B[mj]C[dv: Good];W[ll];B[kh];W[jf];B[ih]C[dv: These successive one space jumps are distinctive of your thick style, which I describe in the end conclusion as a major point.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[hc];B[ie];W[hd];B[je];W[he];B[if]C[dv: The choices made by Black are consistent and thick. As a drawback, the development at the top is reduced.]
;W[df]C[dv: White surrounds in a speedy fashion.];B[cd];W[hf]
(;B[jg]LB[kf:A][hg:B]C[dv: This is slow to the point of submissive. Locally, A is better,  capturing a stone, B is better again but Black can best play in the corner (see var)]
;W[eb];B[db];W[cm]TR[cd][df]SQ[db][eb]C[dv: After two forcing exchanges (the marked ones) White turns to a big move. This is distinctive of his fast style.]
;B[cq]C[dv: With all that thickness, invading is a sound choice.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co];W[cn];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[jq]C[dv: Another speedy move by White, increasing his sphere of influence at the expense of local thickness. White is really playing well here.]
(;B[eq]LB[fq:A]C[dv: This is the major mistake by Black in the game. White has the majority at the bottom half. Black has just taken corner territory in exchange for influence. This is not the time to cut.

I believe you thought White ought to have defended at A and you want to punish him for not doing so.

The situation is not easy (for me). I propose the variation, not as a clear advice, but as a food for thought.]
;W[fr]
(;B[fq]C[dv: this makes matters worse, technically. The variation would have been better, but better even I think would have been not to start this cut.]
;W[gq];B[fp]C[dv: Basically, I think if you see this empty triangle coming, you should hold back and tell yourself  "wait a minute, i'm making things worse here"

This is the second major issue, on which I come back in the conclusion.]

;W[in];B[im];W[jn];B[jm];W[hl];B[hm];W[km]
(;B[kn]C[This stone and M6 was wasted, but not sure what else to do.  I was expecting that pressuring the H5 Group would be my only chance to win.]
;W[lp];B[ln];W[mq];B[mp];W[kp];B[mr];W[mo];B[nq];W[gl]C[dv: This is the kind of move that made me doubt if there was really a 1k at play. It's such a considerate move ... White played more moves like this. I really wondered ...]
;B[jk];W[bf]C[With this territory move, I feel like I was not able to catch up.

dv: Right: in two moves, White created a big potential territory.]
(;B[gi]C[dv: This is too slow. You are very strong there, so a keima jump just to reduce his potential a little, is lacking ambition.

When you realize you are behind, you should try to come back. See variation.

This is the third and final remark in the conclusion.];W[ei]
;B[ee];W[jc];B[kc];W[ib];B[pn];W[mn];B[qn];W[qr]C[Is this a common life pattern for white?

dv: It's an astute, flexible way of playing by White. This is not a kyu move (the previous one), dodging the threat by making corner territory.]
(;B[qp];W[rp];B[ro];W[pr];B[or];W[so];B[rn];W[rs]C[dv: All big areas have been disputed. Technically we're down to the endgame. I believe White's advantage is too big to come back.

[ms][ns]C[dv: Looking at the final position of this game, we can get an idea where things went wrong for Black: the triangled chain is the result of an attempt to cut a strong position. The cutting stones were consequently chased to the neutral centre, with White making territory at the bottom, and influence to the left, which he later converted into a big territory too.
The creation of a heavy (big & weak) group was the major strategic mistake here.

When White played his territorial conversion at 92 (Squared exchange), as you correctly pointed out, his lead became clear. At this point I think Black should have fought back and invade the left, unless one is sure to overcome the territorial difference in the endgame.

In general, in this game Black seems to emphasize thickness over territory, which is a healthy style, but when carried to the extreme, such a game will show a lack of speed (epythomized by the successive one space jumps, circled). White got the time to develop his stones on a sufficiently large scale.

These are the general ideas I would draw from this game. Your technique (first choice of move) and tactical ability don't seem to hold you back here as much as your strategic choices.

I wish you the best of joy in your go career!
