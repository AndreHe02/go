;W[mq];B[cj]C[So far, so good];W[qj]LB[jd:a][qf:b][pi:c]TR[qo]
C[Here; I prefer to make a san-ra-sei at a,
the problem with R10 is that it is too close to the triangle stone.
Of course, if you play a, white can attack at b, but it's fair. A high pincer at c cope very well with such an attack here.]
;B[ql]TR[jq][mq]LB[fc:a][jc:b]C[Too small.
1. White stone is light, so he will not answer.
2. Whenever, he likes, black can make power attacking the triangle stones, so he is overconcentrated in the lower-right.
3. R8 is low, so he will not help black in the future to attack the triangle stones.

The correct idea is to play a or b (matter of taste)]
(;W[qg]LB[jd:a][oq:b]C[Very solid, but a little slack.
White is overconcentrated on the right.
Playing a is bigger

If Black make a pincer against R10, white will flee in the center making usefull influence.

With too (not so) weak groups, white will have to stabilize the botton as soon as possible with such a move like a.

Look at the two variations.];B[cg]LB[fc:a]C[Again, a little overconcentrated. a is better.

As a rule of thumb : always play in the open, where there is as much room as possible to devellop.]
;W[jd]LB[fc:a][fd:b]C[a or b are better.

Because white right is so strong, no need to play close to it, it's better to make solid your top left.]

(;B[cp]LB[co:a][fc:b]TR[cg][cj]C[Locally a is another possibility, C3 is ok however.
Globally, it's bigger to attack the corner at b.
Because of the triangle stones, white is in trouble. 
All the top territory will be destroyed in the process.

See var];W[gc]LB[df:a]C[Slack move, a is better.

Where two moyo are facing, always play at the limit of the two moyos.]
;B[cm]LB[nc:a][qc:b]C[Terrible slack move. If white invade here, it will be hot !

On the opposite you can easily invade at a (or maibe b but a is better) because there is plenty of room here.

It is the worst move of black in this game.];W[or]LB[oq:a]C[a is better shape.]
;B[oq]LB[pr:a]C[No good, simply block at a takes the corner, and white's gain is minimal.]
;W[pr]C[White is so happy to play here, now he is alive at the bottom and can play boldly in the center.]
;B[qr];W[nq]LB[oc:a]C[This move is very solid but a little slow (not needed). a is very very very very BIG.]
;B[mc]LB[nc:a][jb:b]TR[gc]C[No good, a is better. The only avantage of N17 is to slide at b, but because of the triangle stone, sliding at b is not impressive.

It's easier to slide or jump in the corner from a.];W[kc]LB[oc:a]
C[Terrible mistake, you must protect the corner, there is little territory here, much more in the corner.]
;B[me]LB[pb:a][qc:b]C[a is another possibility, but this jump is good, it leave the possibility to invade at b later.]
;W[oc];B[nb]LB[pf:a][lf:b][mg:c][oe:d]C[Bad shape, it's just yose. Fleing in the center is better with a, b, c or d. (a looks like an overplay but it's fun)]
;W[ob];B[lb];W[kb]C[White is happy to protect both right and left like this.]
;B[ma]LB[md:a]TR[me]C[Terrible. It's always better to flee in the center than to make this kind of eye. There is still a weakness at a. White can cut the triangle stone (at some cost but ...)]
;W[cd];B[eg]C[Very good idea];W[fp]C[Good also.];B[fq]LB[gp:a]
C[I prefer a here. F3 is very submissive, white will flee easily now]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[em]LB[fm:a]C[Overpaly, a is better.];B[dl]LB[gm:a]
C[Slack slack, slack. It's time to attack, not to defend. Why not a ? White is in trouble.]
;W[bf]C[Yose move, big yose but the center is more important.]
;B[bg]LB[ho:a]C[Slack, you must attck white in the center, this fight will decide the game, so play first there, at a for example.]
;W[cf]C[Very small.];B[mg];W[gm]C[White play first here, He now leads the game.]
;B[ol];W[oi];B[kf];W[jf];B[ke]LB[jg:a][md:b]C[a is better, this move does not proect the weakness at  b.]
;W[je];B[ld]C[Small life, white has gained here];W[ff]LB[im:a]
C[The center group is weak, it must be protected.];B[fk];W[gp]
;B[rk]LB[hp:a]C[IIf you count territory, white is leading. To recope you must attck the center group at a.]
;W[rj]C[Let black destroy 10 points here and protect the center.]
;B[hp]C[GOOOOD.];W[ho]LB[im:a]C[Thois move helps black, fleeing lightly at a is more fluid. Abandon the 3 stones (only 6 points).]
;B[ip];W[io];B[jp];W[kq];B[ko];W[no]C[Does white want to die in the center ?]
;B[on]LB[hl:a]C[NO, now, go for the kill ! Of course white should live, but this will be amll life and you will make at least 10 motre points in the center in sente.]
;W[hr]LB[km:a];B[hq]LB[km:a]C[Slack : just flee at a. Sooner or later, white will have a BIIIG problem.]
;W[ir];B[gr];W[im]C[Now white is 99% alive.];B[eo];W[fn];B[fo]
C[Bad move, save it for later. It's gote.];W[go];B[en]LB[do:a]
