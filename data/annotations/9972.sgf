AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[*** Mamatt : Hi, thank you very much for reviewing my game.

No problem; sorry it was so delayed; that was my bad.

I focussed on the mistakes in the opening and middlegame. After a certain point, your opponent just started living really well and invading and reducing where he shouldn't have been able to, and that is just a result of better reading and experience. If you're not doing tsumego, that's a good way to fix that leak in your play. If you are doing tsumego, just keep doing them and you'll get better. :)

During the opening and middlegame there were some more general mistakes and more straightforward reading problems with right and wrong answers.

Have fun playing go. :)]PL[W];W[nq];B[oq];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq]

(;B[op]LB[np:A]C[***Mamatt : Mayber better to play at A ?


No, I don't think so. I recommend p2 in the variation, but between o4 and p4, I think p4 is better because after white connects under with p2, you have sente the way you played, but you would still have to go back and connect if you had played at A.]
;W[rp]C[This seems surprising to me. But I guess white really doesn't have many good options here. Even p2, which I've been assuming white would play, isn't that great. Anyway, I think you should get a good result here with white either living small in the corner or barely getting out to the right, but giving you a beautiful wall of influence across the bottom of the board.]
;B[ro];W[rr]
(;B[qn];W[or]C[Here white managed to protect the q2 cut with s4 and s2, and then got to come back and play p2, which now just plain works. It's still probably fine for you since you do get sente, but it could have been much better (see variation).]
;B[fq];W[hp];B[jq];W[fp];B[eq];W[hq];B[jn]LB[in:A][io:B][mo:C]
TR[fp][hp][hq]C[***Mamatt : I think I was trying to put some pressure on the marked white stones, maybe A or B would do the job better ?
Or is it also conceivable to play at C with the idea to seal white in the lower right corner ?


B looks fine to me. A also looks fine, but only if you're willing to fight, because white can play k5, and then you'll be in a fight with 4 weak groups on the board. If you watch Haylee's games, she'll often get into those sorts of fights. Of course, being a pro, she manages to find herself coming out on top nearly every time. :) So if you want to fight, I'd definitley go with A. Otherwise, it's good you avoided it. :)

C seems a little wrong to me. Its connection with the k4 stones is tenuous at best, and it feels to close to your wall while not really putting pressure on white's lower right group since it's alive already anyway. Now after you played k6, then C looks like a viable option to build a huge moyo that white must then invade, but instead of k6, I don't think so.

But actually, I think that k6 was good because it did three things (at least): pressured the h4 group, threatened to enlarge your wall to the tenth line, and protected the k4 group so that it didn't become a target. Multi-purpose moves are good. The only reason I would go with one of your other three options, is if I wanted to fight, in which case A looks like fun.]
;W[ep];B[hn];W[dq]
(;B[dr]LB[cq:A]TR[eq][fq]C[*** Mamatt : Should I just sacrifice the marked stones and play at A ? I don't really see a way to save them after white's cut

A is the correct move, but it doesn't sacrifice the e3 stones; it saves them (see variation).]

;W[qd];B[pe];W[qc];B[dn]LB[ne:A][qe:B][pf:C]C[***Mamatt : I guess I should have played at A ? Then white B and black C ?

I don't think that would have been wrong. You have a giant moyo, so as long as you keep making it more and more solid, you should be good.

But I don't think the played move was wrong either. Anything that makes your moyo more solid. Though it does bear noting that if you think somewhere else is bigger, both A and d6 can be ignored and handled later.]
;W[qe];B[of]LB[pf:A]C[*** Mamatt : A is better, right ?

Yeah, probably. But only because of s14 and it being kindof awkward to deal with.]
;W[pg];B[og]LB[pf:A]TR[pj]C[*** As in the lower left corner I wanted to seal white in and gain outside influence. But I guess it is better to defend the cut by playing at A, which works well with the marked stone to force white to run into the center ?

You are correct: it's better to play at A and then let white run around and try to live while you make stronger influence and quite possibly kill him.]

;B[ch]C[You know how in the opening it goes, corner, sides, center? The center is the most difficult place to live, the sides are second most difficult, and the corner is the easiest place to live in. Unless you've read out that c12 kills, I think that you should exchange e18 (it's sente) and then play something in the corner, probably b18. you can give up e18 later on if white wants it.]

))
(;B[dn]C[At this point, you've committed to giving up the corner in exchance for central influence. I probably would have played d6 instead of f6, but f6 is consistent with h6, so it's a right idea. But here you can't just let white get d6 and break into your moyo, even slightly. c6 allows white a tiny window to try something, while d6 creates some rather pretty shape with the four one point jumps. The shape still has weaknesses, but c6 just seems way too submissive.]
;W[eo];B[en];W[cn]C[Note that if you play like this, it's the same shape we talked about earlier with the cut on the third line. But it's a little different situation here, because black is short on liberties. You should try and read this out to see if you can see why black can't capture the c6 stone in this situation, but could have captured the d3 stone on the bottom.

But even though black can't kill c6, this still looks like a tempting line to play as black since I could extend my wall down to the second line in sente. (hint: it follows as a natural result of playing out the sequence to capture the c6 stone, but then giving up at the appropriate time in the sequence before you start losing more)]
))
(;B[cq]C[This is a good shape to know. It often (not always, so read it out before playing) works, so it should be one of the first things you think of when your opponent plays a cut on the third line in a shape like the one around d3. If white drops down, the key move is to drop down on the side with the single stone. Then you just have to read out if you have enough liberties on the two other stones.

I played out a variation of what might happen here if white insisted on trying to run out the d3 stone even after it became clear it was hopeless. But in this situation, white can't do anything to save the d3 stone. You have just barely enough liberties everywhere. :) I didn't play out what happens if white cuts at c4, but it still works for you. This shape won't always work as sometimes you will be short of liberties, but you should read it out and familiarize yourself with it, because often it does.]

Life and death can be hard to read out, but I would encourage you, if you're worried about a clamp, to check to see if you can just defend by descending. If so, it might be too small to protect right then and there.]

(;B[or]C[Because white can't cut at p4 (see variation), this move looks really good as white will now be split in two.

I found this move because I felt like white was playing very quickly and shouldn't be able to get a comfortable result, but p4 seems to allow that. So what if I split? Splitting the opponent is usually good. Well, I thought, if I split, white can cut. So I read out if the cut worked for white. And it didn't. So I settled on p2.]
