C[Hi, I'm ema and I played with Black in this game.
The game ended after a blunder by White, but up to that point it was kinda balanced.
I had the feeling of being forced to passive or defensive moves throughout the entire game. I'd like to learn how to respond actively to my opponent's threats.

In this review my comments will be labeled with E.

Many thanks to the reviewer. :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[qn];B[ql];W[rp]C[E.: I don't know josekis very much, so I didn't know how to respond here. I ended up by simply defending the corner.

Chiodus: I search various joseki's dictionary but i didn't found this variation. I think you played well]
;B[qq];W[on];B[np]C[Chiodus: It's ok, you gained the botton side and white get nothing. Maybe there is a weakness near M4.]
;W[nl]C[Chiodus: I think P8 it's better because puts more pressure over R8]
;B[pi];W[pk];B[qk];W[ni]C[E.: here I start to feel that my opponent forces me to moves I don't want to make...

Chiodus: I think white is helping you, again you gain the left side and white must run in the center, so don't be afraid]
;B[og]C[Chiodus: I'm not sure about P13, i think R14 is more safe and may help you against an invasion in R17]
;W[kn]C[Chiodus: You can see the vulnerability at M4, but it's ok now you have sente. You have to decide: with F17 it's a moyo game, with C14 you destroy white moyo, your choice. With O8 white group on the goban C14 can be interesting, see variation]

(;B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[eb];B[fb];W[er];B[eq];W[dq];B[fr]C[Chiodus: Not the biggest move, D10 it's much bigger. The points you save with F2 are few, instead white D10 gains much. F2 it's a passive move, if you want to play more actively you must spot the big moves on the goban.]
;W[dj];B[ec]C[E.: here maybe some other moves are bigger (something around n13 maybe?), but I thought that this was sente...

Chiodus: You can't leave white close his central moyo, so you must enter into the center with sometinh like F6 or F14]
;W[dc];B[ee];W[eg]C[E.: another reducing move from White...

Chiodus: I think white is trying to expand is territory, now is important to make F3 black stone move toward the center, you can't simply respond to E13.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[ff]C[E.: from now on, White starts capping my upper side moyo. I ended up controlling a wide area, but I had the feeling of being forced, and I disliked the central power that my opponent gained, even if his formation wasn't that thick. Still, I didn't find any other response to his moves without ruining my framework...

Chiodus: Simply you can ignore white play and find a bigger move on the goban. Anyaway white is helping you again.]
;W[gh];B[hg];W[ih];B[ig];W[jh];B[kg];W[lh]C[Chiodus: Now it's the time to play near F6, it's sente and white can't ignore it. You can return on N13 at later time]
;B[mg];W[hn]C[E.: and here again I felt like being pressed down without having no active reply. This time I tried something more aggressive, though...

Chiodus: Too late];B[fn];W[fo]C[E.: ...but his response didn't let me go much further...]
;B[eo];W[en];B[go];W[fm];B[gn];W[gm];B[do]C[Chiodus: White mistake, must defend the corner]
;W[dn];B[co]C[E.: here I was glad I managed to invade the corner at least, but I think I could have done better.

Chiodus: The corner is worth many points, well done];W[bo];B[cp]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr]C[E.: here I thought I was slightly ahead, so I started thinking about defending...

Chiodus: C2 is passive and gote. You can spot white weakness like N6 or D18. If you want consolidate your territory you can defend the upper corner or close S3.]
;W[qc]C[E.: ...but White gave no time for it.

Chiodus: White takes the opportunity to invade your corner at the right time]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]C[Chiodus: Here you can try this variation]

(;B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[lb]C[E.: here I slipped, and I lost my margin.

Chiodus: S17 can be a better move, later L17];B[mb];W[ma];B[na]
;W[oa];B[kb];W[lc];B[ld];W[kc];B[jc];W[jb];B[kd];W[ka];B[ib]
;W[rd];B[re];W[sd];B[se];W[rb];B[qe];W[pj]C[E.: again, the unpleasant feeling of being forced.

Chiodus: White plays sente moves hard not to respond];B[qj]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[mo];B[jn]C[E.: again, I tried an active reply...]
;W[jm];B[km];W[in]C[E.: ...and again I didn't gain that much.]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[lo];W[lm];B[kp];W[kl];B[jo];W[mn];B[km];W[kn]
;B[mp];W[ho];B[gp];W[hp];B[hq];W[pl];B[kh]C[E.: from this move on, I tried to reduce my opponent's territory exploiting his holes. I think that at this stage he his slightly ahead.

Chiodus: Yes white was haead on the board, plus the komi];W[ki]
;B[hh];W[hi];B[fh];W[fg];B[gi]C[E.: I took a risk to see if I could destroy his center.]
;W[gg];B[ii];W[hj];B[ji];W[kj];B[gf];W[rr]C[E.: I didn't like this move by White.

Chiodus: White too greedy, S3 it's a better choice];B[rq];W[sq]
;B[ro];W[qo];B[qp];W[sp];B[sr];W[ss];B[so];W[rn];B[sr];W[sk]
C[E.: here I think I should have simply defended my territory. Instead, I tried to punish that monkey jump and I ended up being cut.

Chiodus: Yes, remember that you have a weakness in R11/Q12]

(;B[sn];W[sm];B[rm];W[sl];B[rl]C[E.: maybe here S11 is better.

Chiodus: R11 better];W[qi];B[ri];W[ph];B[qh];W[pi];B[rj];W[qg]
;B[rh];W[pg];B[pf];W[of];B[oe];W[ng];B[nf];W[nh];B[of];W[sq]
;B[rp];W[rg];B[db];W[cb];B[ea];W[qm];B[bj]C[E.: an hopeless invasion, maybe. But I spot an hole on D13, so I tried this diversion in order to attack it in sente.]
;W[sh];B[sj];W[br]C[E.: my opponent seemed to ignore my invasion, maybe he thought it had no chance.]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[bm];W[bn];B[bh];W[bl];B[bk];W[al];B[ak];W[cl]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[cj];W[ai];B[di]
(;W[dh]C[E.: the next moves decided the game.];B[eh];W[ei];B[dg]
C[E.: my opponent didn't see the hole at D13, and resigned.
I think I was kinda lucky, because the game up to this point was very close.
I'd like to avoid being pushed the way I was in this match. I'm really bad at spotting active responses, and I end up following my opponent on the goban. Any advice that could help me in becoming more active would be greatly appreciated. And any other advices too, of course. :)

Again, thank you for this review!

Chiodus: In the end you played well and show good fighting spirit, you must train youself spotting big moves on the board a simple moves can change the game. R16 instead of C2 will close the macth immediatly, it's not a simple thing to do but it's necessary for your improvment. Hope the review has helped you]
