C[I did not see that Komi was at 0.5, but nevermind.
White: me
Black: my opponent

Thank you for reviewing my game.

[David\] - No problem.  I want to make one note at the start.  About 2/3 of the way through the game you mention that this is your 10th 19x19 game, or so.  It seems to me that you are playing generally much better than the typical person in their 10th game, even with small board experience.  So my comments may seem somewhat harsh, as I generally try to be blunt about what people do wrong, but you should realize that your play is quite good.  I give you some things to focus on at the end so that you can continue to improve.  Enjoy!]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dd];W[dq];B[nc]C[Well to be honest, I really do not know how to counter this "attack" black 5.

[David\] - This isn't so much an attack as an approach.  Whether it becomes an attack depends as much on your response as on your opponent's play.  There are numerous "peacible" ways to settle this position.  If either player chooses a more complicated, difficult route, then it becomes more like at attack.  I've sketched out the typical play in a variation.]
;W[qf]
(;B[oe]C[This move by B is not typical.  Your presence at the 4,4 point already indicates that you are emphasizing influence over territory.  B here is trying to get into that influence, but in a clumsy way.  The safe option is to play at Q18 and accept the very generous corner.  Probably what I would play given that this isn't a situation I've encountered before.]

(;W[pe]C[Is white 8 good?

[David\] - It is extremely thick.  Your connection there is perfectly safe, so it's much better to play Q18.  See variations]
;B[pc]C[This is the punishment for not taking care of Q18.]
;W[od];B[nd];W[oc];B[ob]
(;W[qc]C[This is highly passive.  See the variation.  It's important to read out options like this before you move so you know where you can play.]
;B[qb];W[pb];B[pa];W[pc];B[na];W[rb];B[cp]C[This is a strange approach.  There isn't a standard response I'm aware of, but simply extending to C3 in response is stronger than it may seem.  A move that is diagonal to an opponent's stone (lie C4 is) is called a "shoulder hit."  There is a proverb in go that says that you should extend in response to a shoulder hit.  This will be true a lot of the time.  The reason is that it creates contact in a way that is strong for you.  Your white stones gain a liberty in the process of contacting, whereas the black stone loses one.  B will now have to worry about his survival, whereas W starts to make a base in the corner.  See variation.  This move by B could be considered an attack (though a poor one) compared to the previous approach in the top right corner.]

(;W[do]C[Again, I do not really know how to defend against such a stone.

[David\] - This is a bad idea for a major reason:  It allows B to split your stones easily, while gaining strength in his own stones.  There is another go proverb that states "Even a fool connects against a peep."  What that means is that, whenever an opponent plays a stone that threatens to separate you, you should connect.  With this move, you are inviting your opponent to separate you, essentially creating the peep yourself.]
;B[cq]C[B gives you a reprieve, but does take that nice 3,3 point.]
;W[dp]C[Phew.];B[dr];W[co]C[Good, ignore the small stuff.];B[bp]
;W[bo]C[.. and I obviously did not defend good, I think.

[David\] - This is a good result given that you played the D5 stone.  However, a better first play here would have benefitted you more.]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[fq];W[gq];B[gr];W[hq];B[hr];W[cf];B[iq];W[go]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[ho];W[hn]C[This stone is very very small.  You are safe, and this isn't really getting you any territory, whereas B is gaining on the bottom right.  You need to stop that.]
;B[io];W[cd]C[good move?

[David\] - It's odd.  Here you really want to play in the bottom right as I see it.  B has influence there that you would like to break up.  Also, this move invites B into your nice influence on the left side if he plays over the top if your stones.  I would have preferred something like F17 in this area, but  as I said, bottom right is more important.]
;B[cc]C[This is good for you.  It's a standard move for B, but in this instance the fact that you have so much influence on the left side makes it bad.  He is giving you the left.]
;W[bd];B[cb];W[bc]C[SO SMALL!  That is worth next to nothing!  D15 is screaming out for a play!  This move adds nothing to your safety, does not threaten B's safety, and adds a single point to your score.  D15 is much much bigger.  Or F17 or G17 maybe.  In order to avoid this small stuff you have to break the habit of following what seems to be the flow of play.  B made a move in that direction, so you follow.  However, this gives B control over your moves and it means you aren't really thinking about what's best.  On every single move you have to pause for a minute and make sure you aren't blindly following the flow.  This is much easier to do when playing in person compared to online, as you actually have to physically pick up a stone.  For that reason, I always take my hand off the mouse after I play a stone online.  That way I have to make some significant physical action, and I'm reminded to make sure I'm using my head.]

(;B[bb]C[The fact that B responds is a major reprieve to you.  He could have shifted focus and made real gains.]
;W[de]C[Phew!!!  See the variation for the disaster.];B[ed]
;W[qj]SQ[he][qn]C[This is quite passive.  As a new player, it's often hard to see how to attack, so you simply extend instead.  This allows your opponent to take initiative and control the game.  The B stone in the lower right still has not been contested.  B has two unfinished shapes at the top.  These are higher prioroty than a simple extension.  I give some examples of where I might play here.]
;B[oj]C[A strange move by B.. he seems to be defending the center, which is not his to defend.  Much better would be to play in the uncontested corner.]
;W[ph]C[This isn't necessary.  Your stones on top are perfectly safe.  The stone below has many options.  If B tried to separate them, you just expand toward the bottom.  This is very small.]
;B[of]C[And this is even smaller!];W[og]C[If you are safe, look around a bit before you play.  Here you are following again.]
;B[ng];W[nh];B[pg];W[oh];B[pf];W[qg];B[me];W[re]C[I guess white 64 is unneccesary.

[David\] - Yes indeed.  Read out the moves in your head before playing.

As I wrote that I noticed that this was a 10 min SD game.  I don't think I'd recommend playing that speed right now if you want to improve your game.  It means you can't really think about the moves as they happen.. only afterward once it's too late to improve them.  I would play some slow games and practice reading out the consequences of the moves.  Reading is a learned skill that can be very frustrating and difficult, but there isn't any substitute.  If you are able to read better than your opponent, it is an enormous advantage.  One you learn to read 4-5 moves ahead, reading 1-2 moves (like this situation) is almost second nature.]
;B[rd];W[qa]C[Also white 66 was not needed, if I'm not wrong.

[David\] - Something new players will do is make an attempt at reading, then decide on the result, but still be unsure.  This is what you are indicating to me here.  I won't say whether you are right or wrong, because once you read it properly, you will *know.*  You won't need my confirmation.]
;B[ql]C[Ah, now B takes over on the bottom and the chance is lost.]
;W[ok]C[This stone is a little abstract.  What is its purpose?  Where does it run when it gets cut off?  I would focus more on territory and less on stones.  Where can you play here to get territory?  Blur your vision a little and look for bigger plays.]
;B[ol];W[pk];B[pl];W[nk];B[nl];W[rl];B[rm];W[rk];B[lk];W[nj]
;B[lh];W[lj];B[kj];W[li];B[ki];W[mg];B[mf];W[nf];B[ne];W[mh]
;B[lg];W[mk];B[ll];W[ml];B[mm];W[jl];B[km]C[Regarding the last sequence.. what a disaster for W!  W gained a few points on the left, maybe 10.  In return, B is now utterly uncontestable on the bottom and has enormous influence on the top.  Allowing yourself to be enclosed like this leads to major gains for your opponent.  This stems from focusing on capturing stones and fighting and not on territory.  Take a step back and see where B has potential for territory, then try to reduce it (not eliminate it, that's impossible).  This has simply added to B's potential.]
;W[jm];B[jn];W[in];B[ko]C[At this point I started to think that I had no chance against my opponent, as he got the bottom right corner (very big territory), and he got the upper part of the board. (which i would invade later)

[David\] - This is also how I see it.  There were still options at move 66, but the next sequence shut it down for you.]
;W[cj]C[This is defensive when you are behind.  If you are losing, you need to start fighting!]
;B[il];W[ik];B[jk];W[hl];B[ij];W[im];B[hk]
(;W[il];B[hi]C[This silly sequence was a fight over 2 stones.  There are bigger fish to fry!  Let him have the 2 stones while you make real gain!]
;W[kl];B[gl];W[kk];B[lm];W[jj];B[ji];W[hj];B[gj]C[I do not really understand 101-117. Where is my mistake so that he could get his stones "on top" of my group?

[David\] - It was more than any one move, there were several that led up to it, mostly a result of worrying about losing a couple stones when there were more important things to worry about.  I put in a variation to give an idea how to respond, but the best move of all is somewhere else on the board.]
;W[ic]C[The first time in my life that I tried this kind of invasion. (well, this is maybe my 10th go-game on a 19x19 board)
Is white 118 good? Or are there any better options? I chose this because I have space to both sides here.

[David\] - This is probably doomed to failure, but only because it came so late.  In general, you don't want to invade, you want to reduce (unless your opponent is just asking for it).  When you wait until this point, though, invading is your last option.  A reduction here would be more like G14, where B has a tough choice between allowing you to reduce and attacking the reducing stone.  With this invasion, B's course of action is clear: attack!]
;B[el]C[B is very confident about the top.];W[ek]C[Forget this!  Now is your chance to actually make your invasion work!  Dont be a follower, lead your game.  E8 for B is a big threat, but at this point you are behind, so you need to think aggresively.]
;B[gn];W[gm];B[fn];W[fm];B[em];W[en];B[fl];W[fo];B[cm];W[dl]
C[Your stones have 2 eyes now, so there is no need to defend.  Attack!  In a game where you were winning, this type of play would be okay.]
;B[dk];W[dm];B[ej];W[ck];B[fk];W[di]C[That was actually a nice sequence, but the gain won't win you the game.]
;B[ei];W[dh];B[eh];W[eg];B[fg];W[ef];B[ff];W[fc]C[Too big step with white 144?

[David\] - No, this is fine.  I wouldn't expect survival here, but that is among your best options.]
;B[eb];W[fb];B[ee];W[kc]C[Whoa, B really gives you a chance!  Now you may be able to make it.]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[fa];W[ga];B[ea];W[hb];B[ia];W[lb];B[mb];W[la]
;B[lc];W[ka];B[kd];W[ib];B[id];W[jd];B[je];W[jc];B[le]C[Lucky you!  B doesn't defend well and you get life.  Now use it to take more territory away from B!]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[gd]C[So conservative!  You have life!  Run with it!

This brings up a side point.  You may not have known you had life here.  It's very impportant to know what shapes are alive, and when you have 2 eyes.  Practice figuring out what shapes are alive and it will help you.]
;B[fd];W[gc]C[Group is alive, I was relieved.

[David\] - It was already very much alive.  I am certainly the opposite of relieved.. you could have done so much more damage with it!!]
;B[hf]C[Aughgh, chance lost!];W[rn]C[I think this is a good move. (white 174)

[David\] - Yes, it's probably the biggest left.];B[qn];W[sm]
;B[qm];W[ro];B[rp];W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[qq];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr]
;B[rs]C[You can safely play elsewhere here, no need to respond.  Keeping sente is very important in the endgame, so read out each play.  The nice thing is that it's much easier to read at the end of the game.]
;W[sp];B[cl]C[This won't get B anywhere.];W[dn];B[ao];W[an]
;B[ap];W[bm];B[dj];W[bi];B[qk];W[ri]C[Was white 198 necessary?

[David\] - Read it yourself and make absolutely sure.  So sure you don't need to ask me.]
;B[mi];W[mj];B[ec];W[oq]C[Second try for an invasion. Would a better player than me get a living group or was it generally hard to get some territory here?

[David\] - This would generally be considered a rude move unless you're sure you can get something out of it.  This type of "prospecting" in your opponent's territory tends to prolong the game.  If you actually read out a weakness, that's fine.  However, at this point, there is still a big move to be had in A18.  Taking the corner is significant at the end of the game.]

I was surprised that I won, seems like I am really bad at estimating the score.


Thanks for your work :)

[David\] - Yes, the win came on poor defense by B.  He had the game locked up.  Estimating the score is actually an important skill as well, as your play will change depending on whether you are ahead or behind.  There are fast ways of "counting" the game, as it is called, that you can learn and do every 30 moves or so.  If you aren't familiar with Sensei's Library, I would recommend you take a look around their website (http://senseis.xmp.net/).  They have articles on counting and on about anything else you could hope to learn.  As I mentioned at the start, you are doing quite well for having played 10 19x19 games, do don't take my comments harshly.  I just want to give you every option to improve.  It took me a lot more than 10 games to get to the 17k level.  The main areas I can see you improving your game from here are:

1) Working on not following your opponent's lead.  Move your hand away from the mouse and consider whether, at each move, you could just pick up and move somewhere else on the board.  This will help you keep control of your games.

2) Playing big moves.  This is related to the above point.  Another proverb in go states "Play urgent moves, then big moves."  If there aren't any urgent moves (i.e. if you aren't defending the life if your stones), that means you are safe to play the bigges move you can find.

3) Learn when stones are alive.  This is also related to the above, and it's a crucial basic go skill.

4) Practice reading.  This is a huge help in fights and will keep you from wasting defensive moves when you should be playing big moves elsewhere.]
