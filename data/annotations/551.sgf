K3, c7, m3, r14, o17, etc.]WL[593];B[nq]C[janr: dont know if this  good]
BL[590];W[qe]C[janr: strange (i mean: dont know.  my answer is probably  incorrect.

You are right, this isn't a good move
for white. Too close]WL[575];B[pe]C[This is probably ok, it's hard for me to say for sure, I'd prefer r16 though .. just take some solid territory and wait till later to punich him for playing too close.]
BL[576];W[qd]WL[570];B[qc]BL[573];W[qf]WL[566];B[rc]C[good]
BL[569];W[pf]WL[550];B[cn]C[this is bad ... i mean it's good move, but your timing is bad.  The top right shouldn't be left alone.  p17 defending the cut looks slow, but I think it's solid.  It sets you up to attack him on the right or to make more territory by extending up the top left.  Now he can exploit your weakness if he wants to.]
BL[562];W[fq]C[well, white answered, so no harm, you should now return to upper right.]
WL[538];B[mc]C[seems a bit far.  see, the problem is p14 is sente for white and that a really big move if he follows it with something like O9]
BL[541];W[iq]C[too small]WL[512];B[cq]C[janr: i were also considering L3,  K17

vlk: I don't like this move. B4 is better.  This seems greedy.  YOu will lose more than you gain with this. k17 is big too.  but the right side seems urgent.  p14 is big for both sides.  or you can try to make use of the s4 stone and try an invasion.  maybe q11 .. but it really hurts you that p14 is sente for white.]
BL[521];W[cp]WL[499];B[dq]C[i think this is wrong ... white can kill black now I think ... i haven't worked it out ... but I'm pretty sure.]
BL[516];W[eq]C[well this is wrong, black lives now.]WL[495]
;B[bp]BL[509];W[bo]WL[492];B[bq]BL[505];W[co]WL[489];B[bn]C[janr: dont know if these forcing moves are good.  it seems to help  corner group, but does weaken side group a little (?).

vlk: actually you got it back wards, this move hurts the corner group and strengthens the side group.  I think if white now plays A4 you have big trouble.
But his is the whole problem with the corner invasion in the first place ... it weakens your side group too much ... however, if you now live in the corner after this move it might have been worth it, but only because of his mistakes ... this is important to understand ... if it succeeds it's because he messed up not because you played well.]
BL[502];W[an]C[This is good.  Now I think black will see why the corner invasion was a mistake.]

;B[ds]BL[468];W[cs]C[I don't understand this at all. white should play b7, this is a huge move.]
WL[454];B[rg]C[janr: trying to invade threatening to connect to  S17

vlk: this is such a bad move, it has no merit whatsoever.  Your lower left corner is dead now if white plays.  You've lost the left side if white plays, and this invasion is too deep and poorly planned.  White can play S16 then p14 and even if you live, you won't get much and will probably end in gote and lose the lower left corner.]
BL[445];W[qg]C[This was bad.]WL[439];B[se]C[janr: if connecting was good,it must be T16 or T14 i think. this doesnt work and gives white  to much influence.]

BL[367];W[pl]WL[345];B[rl]C[This move is so small and pointless I don't know what to say.]
BL[586];W[on]C[See last comment.  Are both players blind to the importance and size of the lower left and left side?  black is alive on the right, he has no fear and white will be impossible to kill.]
WL[581];B[jc]BL[550];W[ci]C[I'm really confused by this whole situation.  at least white has attacked the important area .. but done it wrong. b7 or d6 are better.]

vlk: g17 is a joseki, just not the most common one.  it's thinner than the normal move, but has more influence down the side.  It's a trade off.  It's not a bad move.]

;W[pk]WL[553];B[nk]C[janr: im happy.  but is this last move  useful?

vlk: white let you push him around too much.  i'm still concerened about the lower left corner.  this last move is wrong if you want to secure your invading stones, although since they were all forcing moves you could treat them lightly and ignore them.]
BL[542];W[el]WL[539];B[dl]BL[538];W[em]C[blacks move was bad, and white's answer was worse.  White shouldn't have played the e8 stone at all if this is how he's going to play.   he has to asnwer d7 now.  if he is so cowardly he has to play e7 in the first place.]
WL[532];B[gj]C[janr: or is invading lower white moyo better?

vlk: hard to say.  this is a sort of invasion ... while expanding your own, so it's ok, but d7 might be sente for black (e6 next could be very damaging to white.)]
