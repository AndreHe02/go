C[Hello. I am Daedin, currently 13k on KGS, playing with Black here. I was not too pleased with the way I played this game (partly due to a shorter clock time than what I am used to).I tried to point out where I felt Black made mistakes - or sometimes where White did. Please feel free to comment on anything you find relevant, particularly on the opening, or direction of play. Thank you kindly for your time



Hello. I hope you enjoy my review of your game. I will try to add some comments for both sides.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[de];W[dh]SQ[dp]C[A pincer like this will be more difficult with the black stone on hoshi]

(;B[ec]C[Daedin: Jumping to F16 or G16 better ?



This move is certainly possible, I guess the others are in fashion.]
;W[eb]LB[fc:B][ed:A]C[A is the joseki move]
(;B[fc]LB[ed:A]
(;W[fb];B[gc];W[gb]C[Daedin: Here Black was pretty happy with white pushing on the second line from behind



Yes Black got away with a joseki mistake :)];B[hc];W[nc]C[Sure, White can tenuki now]

(;B[lc]LB[oc:A][pf:B][qf:C]C[Daedin: I got the impression it was not so good for White to invade here. The pincer bM17 is both a pincer and a extension from the H17 group. Would L17 have been better ? (it would suppress the gap at K17)



I can't say I like this tight pincer. I would prefer to answer at  A B or C. I know M17 functions as an extension, but it doesn't feel right here.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc]C[Daedin: I feel R17 is necessary to keep White from making a base too easily.

Daedin: However wouldn't it have been better to let White live there, and attack the White stone at D12, wth D10 for instance ?



No, R17 is important with his shape. Infact I welcome this aji keshi here]
;W[kd]LB[ld:A][md:B]C[Daedin: A bit of an overplay I'd think. White seems to call an attack at N16



White should perhaps attach at A, A is where you should play]

(;B[md]LB[ld:A]C[A seems better];W[nd];B[me];W[ib]
(;B[nf]C[Daedin: Overplay ? The cut at N14 proved dangerous, since the N16 stones are surrounded



Looks natural to me, but you can't quite seal White in, so it leads to a complicated game]

;B[li];W[jj]
(;B[nq]LB[if:A][lj:B]C[Daedin: I didn't chase because I thought white could either link up with M10 or with the F8 group. However bM10 might have been good becuase it puts pressure on the still-not-totally-safe P15 stones.



I like Black M10 here, or just taking the three stones];W[qm]

(;B[pj]LB[if:A]C[Daedin: M10 better ?



I prefer taking the 3 stones at A, this seems a threat on the white center, so looks like sente to me, M10 could follow]

Amusing when this happens ;-) Sometimes both players forget.

It looks like this invasion almost kills, but as it doesn't I think it is ok to leave this move. K14 remains big, as is B12]

Ok, overall I think you leave too much aji in your groups. You should play more solidly, more honte.

Your instincts are good, but you make the game too difficult for yourself if this game is anything to go by ;-)]
