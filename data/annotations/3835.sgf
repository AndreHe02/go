AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I played with the black stones.
Thank you for your help.
I wrote down some comments and questions.];W[nc]C[I don't know, how to answer this move.
I think on one of the triangles - or tenuki?
vlkplk: You can choose any of usual joseki, or play some large point such as 
K4.]
(;B[pc]C[vlkplk: This move is sometimes used to protect corner, 
but at the beginning of game its too submissive. Black would better to think 
of board as a whole. In Go its always some kind of a trade between 
players-give up somewhere to gain elsewhere.
You know the basic of (handicap) Go-try to divide oponents stones while 
keeping connected your own as much as possible? The reasons behind this are 
two 1)connect two dead groups with one eye and they become alive 2)you get 
less territory with more separate groups. I.e. you need more stones to 
encircle territory, when yours stones get separated.];W[qd]
C[I've read 
that the corner should be mine- but 
hwo?];B[qe];W[qc];B[qb];W[re];B[rc]C[a mistake
vlkplk: Yes, maybe a mistake. But as you have said before, you wanted to get 
a corner? Which you have got, finally... The problem lies elsewhere, not in 
getting or not getting the corner...];W[rd];B[rb];W[qf];B[pe]
;W[pf];B[of];W[ne];B[sd]C[the 
next mistake
vlkplk: Not a 100% mistake. At least, white answered this move. It can be 
said a bad move, because 1)its endgame move-means you can leave for later 
2)it destroyes the aji-means you made white to complete his formation 3)it 
could have been later used as a ko threat.];W[rf]C[vlkplk: Anyway, white group Q14 has not very effective shape. 
So i
t can be said good from 
black.]
(;B[nd];W[md];B[od];W[mc];B[me];W[nf]C[vlkplk: 
After this i would definitely play as in the 
variation...]
(;B[mf]C[vlkplk: When pushing oponnents stones like this, 
you have to think about result. Ususaly, its good, because you are the one, 
who chooses the direction. One rule of Go is to push against stronger stones 
to attack weaker stones on the other side. So it means, after you stop 
pushing, you will attack, in this case, that N17 group of white stones. 
Needles to say, that at the same time Q14 group becomes very strong, but 
this can't be helped.];W[ng]C[now it is acatastrophe
vlkplk: don't leave it half-way unfinished... its not a catastrophe at all! 
just problem is the life of black Q17 group.]
(;B[cj]C[vlkplk: Its 
always necessary to play at the weak points first of anything else. In this 
time, was better for black to protect somehow the cut at Q18. Directly or 
indirectly...];W[fc]C[vlkplk: By this move, white rescued finally both 
his two groups (N17 and Q14), which black was trying to separate so 
hardly...Black two stones at N15 are very weak and it also adds to white's 
safety.

As well, if black fails to potect Q17 group by either surviving in the 
corner or capturing whites N17 stones, white can ALWAYS during the game kill 
that corner just by one 
move...];B[cc]
(;W[ee]
(;B[ed]C[tenuki?

vlkplk: NO! Just cut and fight. Or as in var. If tenuki, white gets nice 
chance to surround black in the corner, which is usualy said to be not 
good.];W[fd]
(;B[de];W[cg]
(;B[ef];W[fe];B[cf];W[dg];B[bg];W[df]C[vlkplk: This 
cut is painful. And blacks cutting stone now doesn't have enough support on 
outside, because of whites 
strength.];B[eg];W[dh];B[be];W[ei];B[di];W[eh];B[ej];W[cn];B[cq]

think this was animportant point to live with this group
vlkplk: for sure!];W[qn]
(;B[qq]C[vlkplk: I think this is too defensive move. 
There are other more effective ways to play and protect the corner. See 
var.];W[nq]
(;B[jq];W[oo]C[vlkplk: This is disastrous. Black must see already 
the terrible power of white in the center and don't allow to be surrounded 
like this. Under any 
cost.];B[po];W[pn];B[op];W[np];B[no];W[on];B[mo];W[lq]C[vlkplk: Now, two 
black stones at N5 are really important. Maybe even more, than lower right 
corner.];B[oq];W[kp];B[jp];W[ko];B[nr];W[mr];B[or];W[jo];B[io]
C[I'm not 
satisfied with the outcome in all three corners:
I own the corner, but he has all the power towards the center (thickness?)

There were a lot of moves from him that surprised me - he played better then 
me and I thought I would lose.];W[gp]
(;B[gq]C[vlkplk: Better at H4. Just imagine white continue in variation.
Key point is J6 now. If white gets chance to haneh there, he would win the 
game.]
(;W[fq];B[fp];W[hq];B[gr];W[ip];B[iq];W[hp]
(;B[fr];W[hr];B[ho];W[go];B[fo];W[gn]C[vlkplk: Its roughly clear, that black 
will have no points in the center, while white has many there. So blacks 
quest now is to go to the whites huge center as far as he/she can. During 
the process, black may lose something, but most important is to reduce 
whites space under any cost.
But this problem has roots much more earlier. Its always hard for "weaker" 
player to controll the balance on the board all the 
time.]
(;B[gl];W[gk];B[fj];W[hl];B[gm]C[vlkplk: This black move was mistake. Its clear black cant escape. What was 
important now for black, just to go to the center and reduce whites 
territory as much as 
possible.];W[fm];B[hm];W[im];B[fn];W[em];B[hk];W[hn];B[gj];W[hj]
;B[gl];W[gm]C[b- makes it complicated all the time. Seems to be his / white's job.
vlkplk: This move at G7 was mistake from white! But, ofcourse, as stronger 
player, he makes it complicated all the time :)]
(;B[gk]C[vlkplk: Too weak.];W[ik];B[ij];W[hi];B[jk];W[il]C[vlkplk: Now, white's mistake was not punished 
enough.];B[en];W[dn];B[bl];W[cm];B[og]
(;W[oe]C[A big mistake - now the game seemed to change. Was it a "game losing 
move"?
vlkplk: Certainly, THIS was not a loosing move. As the board seems, this 
game would be lost even without this move. Just only, white should play, or 
make use of the possibility of plying this move much more earlier. Now, 
whites positions are strong and unshakable everywhere, so there is nothing 
to do.
Actually, black made very good use of his stones J10 and K9 to catch white. 
I didn't notice it and so didn't white.
So, if I were white, and notice the ladder, I would play as in 
variation.];B[nh];W[mg];B[lg];W[ph];B[mh]C[I didn't dare to wait.
Now my plan was to keep my territory in the corners an don't give him a lot 
of points in the center.
vlkplk: After this white mistake, black seems to win the game for sure... 
Just keep the 
advantage.];W[oj];B[nj];W[nk];B[oi];W[pi];B[ok];W[pj];B[mk]
;W[nl]C[now he secured the right side - what was my mistake?
vlkplk: I think there was not a big mistake-simply, white was so strong on 
right side already, that black couldn't reduce it much. You played all 
right.];B[ml];W[mj]
(;B[ni]C[vlkplk: THIS WAS THE MISTAKE. But it is not easy to count as far. See 
variation for safe connection.];W[lj];B[kj]C[a mistake?

I still have points in the corners - he on the right side and a lot of power 
in the center. Am I right?
vlkplk: Still the situation is not bad for black, until he can invade the 
upper side. And there is lot of endgame points, ofcourse. At the end of 
game, the SENTEH becomes more and more important...
I think, in this stage of game, You cant speek of "power" in the center.

the 
center.];W[kd];B[jf];W[le];B[je];W[lf];B[kc];W[jd];B[kg];W[ld]

vlkplk: Dont know. Ko is always complicated. But since there are lot of 
other good points, black should avoid to play KO like this.The reason for 
this: simply, if black lost the ko, he would lost many. If black wins the 
ko, he gets 2points(or 3, I'm not sure) But still there are bigger points 
left on the board. So, count it for yourself, the benefit of this kind of
