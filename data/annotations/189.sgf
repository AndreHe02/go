not urgent! something like 'a' looks more healthy!];B[pk];W[of];B[oe];W

seems even locally the last white move was not good, what can you do now?]

why not 'a', at least you threaten to live, when you escape you will only  hurt your moyo on the top!]

unnecessary, locally 'a' better shape];W[lm]C[
good!];B[jk];W[il]L[jm]C[a bit strange move? maybe better 'a'  to continue escaping?]

'a' is more severe now];W[jl]C[

yep, good move!];B[gn];W[ql]L[qm]C[very urgent move, but at 'a' is  better shape.]
