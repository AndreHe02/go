KM[0.5];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj]M[qk]C[I am not sure about this, but possibly this could be  better one down at the marked position. See the discussion  next move, possibility a).]

(;B[qn]L[ql][qh][qo]M[qj][qg]C[I don't  like this move. It forces a black answer, but has no  followup, and black is nicely settled afterwards. In fact,  the stability of the two marked white right-side stones made  your attacks later that much harder to pull through.

Alternatives I would consider:         a) aggressive, aims at moyo
       b) aim at invasion
       c) same idea as yours, but with a follow-up at a)
My favourite would be a), aiming at a larger scale position.];W[qg]
(;B[dj]L[fq]C[Looks fine, but I would prefer a). The lower side is big ...]
;W[jc]C[Wrong side! The upper side has less potential  for black than the lower and is therefore smaller.]
;B[fq]C[Good move];W[cn];B[jp]C[Nice position.];W[ch]
(;B[fc]C[Hmm, this brings the potential for two  weak black groups.
How about the 3-3 invasion instead?];W[dc]C[Correct];B[fe];W[mc]C[Nice move.  White settles his own stones before embarking  on a big splitting attack, and it looks hard for black to  find a convincing defensive move. Also whites move aims at  potential trouble in the upper right corner (lets call it big
yose for the time being ...). At least black lost his advantage  from a few moves ago.]

(;B[cf]L[dg][km]C[Q: Is this move an overplay?
A: You bet! Certainly looks like one. This is the correct point
for an invasion, BUT ... you are starting a fight  in an area where white is stronger! It looks hard to find
a convincing black move locally. My vote goes for a), planning to
exchange thickness for territory. Another way to play is leave  the upper side for the time being, strengthen your territory on the  lower side and dare white to try his worst. Or maybe a move at
around b), trying to do a little of everything.];W[df];B[de]L[ee][ce]
C[The  move white played here, a), looks too tough, a `now I'll  kill ALL your stones' type policy. Black has a chance to counter.
 b) seems to be good enough.]
(;W[ee]N[a)];B[ce];W[ed]M[fe][fc]L[ef][dg]C[Blacks move to come (a) is too hefty. This  invites disaster,
or at least it should have ... you were lucky! (see later).
I suggest changing direction with b). The two marked stones  are relatively light.]

(;B[ef]N[a) game];W[dg];B[fd]L[bc]C[You can  try to live with a) instead, but thats also  gives no brilliant result.]
;W[bd]C[death ...];B[eg]C[This move is in  principle not good, forcing white into  `hane at the head of two stones'. If you want to play  there, the solid connection looks like better style.
However, this is also the move that saved your neck a  little later, so maybe I shouldn't criticise it :)]
;W[eh];B[bh]
(;W[cg]L[bi]C[... and resurrection. A terrible move! The only thing  white achives is to lose himself one liberty. a) kills!]
;B[bg];W[ci];B[bi]C[It's not pleasant having to live like that in gote.  but at least white keeps some weaknesses too.]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[ck];B[be];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bk];W[bl];B[ak]C[Phew ... now to the upper group ...]
;W[cd];B[bf];W[ff]L[gg]C[White could also try a large scale attack on the  whole group,
at a) say. However black isn't likely to die, and connecting  those groups makes white incredibly strong.]
;B[id]C[Good move.];W[fg]C[Looks slow but removes all bab aji, so I think
I quite like that move];B[jd];W[kc]
(;B[ld]L[jg]C[Hoping for too much. white can  cut, and white  is very very strong in the area. You are doing  well territory-wise, so better just make some shape
and wait. A move at a) strikes my fancy, but I am quite  bad with shape, so don't put too much faith in that.]
;W[kd];B[lc]C[Ojojoj, heavy stuff. It is rarely good to let
your opponent disconnect you that strongly.];W[ke]C[Very pleasant move ...]
;B[if]
(;W[jg]L[ic]C[Looks inviting certainly, but I'd rather take  blacks eyes away with a), gaining security on  the upper side and planning to lead black a merry  chase. Black shouldn't die, but white should be able  to make a very strong invasion at the bottom that way.]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[ic];W[md];B[og];W[lg];B[qh]
(;W[pg]L[ph]C[I prefer the hane at a) ...];B[of]L[ph]C[You can't really hope to attack white at the top  immediately. Split him at a) instead! Lovely territory ...]

(;W[ph];B[pi];W[qi];B[oh];W[pj];B[oi];W[pe]C[Mistake: ...];B[pf];W[qf];B
[qe];W[rh]C[... a nice sequence for black.]
(;B[jm]C[The right sort of move. The problem  is that blacks moyo is  still very open, especially the corner. Black still
looks ahead in territory, so maybe it's time to secure it.];W[mn];B[nm]
L[mp]C[Maybe better at a) again.];W[oq];B[op];W[pr];B[nq];W[or]
(;B[pp]L[nr]C[The bottom centre is still big. I would seal it with a).]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[mr];B[qr]C[Correct now, but ....];W[lq];B[lp];W[kq];B[kp]
;W[ir]C[.... unfortunately, white steals rather a lot of territory.  You would have been better off sealing the (big) bottom centre.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[ep];W[dr];B[er]C[Interesting. Hard to win that ko, but you are
behind now and have to try something.];W[eq];B[jq];W[jr];B[dq];W[mp];B[np]

;W[fp];B[eq];W[fo];B[gq];W[bn];B[bo];W[bp];B[ao]C[Death or glory. But that is  the right strategy here,  and this fight is hard to read out. (At least for me :))]
;W[em];B[ap];W[ar];B[aq];W[br];B[dm];W[dl]
(;B[en]C[Instead of pushing through, you actually have a  ko for connectionon on the left side. This
is just for fun, as it is not an  easy ko to fight (and even harder to find :)).]
;W[fn];B[fm];W[hp]C[Good  move by white. If white connects, black wins.]
;B[el]C[Unfortunately, you must capture, because the ko for
connection does not work any more when white connect.
One less liberty ...]
(;W[gp]L[hq]C[Oh dear, the wrong way to block! If at  a), you've had it.]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[ip];W[gn]C[looks like the only move with  a hope ...];B[gm]
;W[hn]
(;B[hm]L[in]C[Shame, after all that wonderful  brawling
you make a misstep here. Play at a) and white is  in the ropes!];W[in];B
[ds];W[gr];B[hr];W[hs];B[fs]C[Nice idea, but  sadly to no avail.];W[gs]
;B[is];W[js];B[bq];W[bs];B[ls];W[ms];B[ps]C[Again, VERY  nice idea! One liberty more and ...]
;W[ks];B[os];W[is];B[ls];W[lr];B[mo]C[Hmm. My first reaction: a good place to resign after a
very good try. But on closer counting: You are not actually  that far behind! (maybe 15 points). So I guess you were right  to play on.]
;W[jn];B[im];W[km];B[dk]L[fj]C[Destroys potential. Better to  play a lighter move, at a)  for example.]
