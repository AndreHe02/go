(;B[oe]C[I find this response odd. White's position is relatively weak, given the black stones around the position. Why give up the stone at r15?]
;W[re];B[pd];W[qg];B[oh]C[You asked about knowing where to play. I can see from this move your difficulty.

The stone at q17 has two natural directions of development. They are to r15 and to k16. White has a nice, flexible group around r15. Rather than struggle against this position, it is best to use q17's power towards its secondary goal. Rather than this move, I would take a  point like L16 or k17.]
;W[og];B[qe]C[This ko accomplishes nothing here. Back has no threats to back it up. If you intend to pursue this, do so later in the game.]
;W[qc];B[rd];W[rf];B[qb];W[rc]
(;B[cf]C[<Alguien> This is the first example. Would it be better to cap at o13? (or somewere else?)

White's natural response to this approach is to extend out along the top. This will cut dramatically into the strength of the black wall in the upper right corner. See the variation for a joseki based on approaching the other side of d16.]

;W[me];B[nd];W[ne];B[nf];W[id]C[White has succeeded in making a solid base on the top. Black's lone stone on the left hangs in dangerous waters. White has additional threats to cut on either side of m17, depending on how other fights turn out.]
;B[do]C[<Alguien> Each of this changes cost me a lot of thinking.

Not a bad move, but again ignores the natural development of your starting stones. The star points naturally develop to connect. Therefore, q4 would like to extend to k4 and q10. The Chinese opening starts it toward q10, but fighting there is threatening. And extension to k4 would ease its trouble.

However, d5 has a couple of bad effects. Since white wants to develop to either c5 or k4 this move tends to move white toward k4, which is where black would like to go. So this move works at cross-purposes to q4.

In addition, there is no black strength on the left side. D5 would be punishing if the approach at c14 had resulted in a solid black shape. However, with only these floating stones, black can be easily cut up at white's leisure.]
;W[dm]C[White starts this process with a high pincer.];B[fo]
;W[fq];B[ho];W[qn]C[An excellent move by white. The stones at the bottom left are secure enough to leave for now. They can connect under at c5, or live outward to h3. When a group can go two directions and still live and profit, you can leave it to pursue other opportunities.

White's approach here also uses the inherent strength of his group above. The black stones inbetween now seem distant from q4 and in danger.]

;B[mp];W[pl];B[ol];W[pk];B[ok];W[pi];B[oi]C[You have lost focus on what you set out to do. With the Chinese opening, you boldly stated at the beginning of the game, "The right side is mine! Invade at your peril!" Well, white has accepted your challenge and defeated you in a fight of your choosing. Black has given up the right side completely at this point and neither right corner is fully secure.

Worse yet, the black stones in the center of the right side have no base. They will have to connect to a live group or form eyes on their own. Even if they should succeed, the struggle should bring white great amounts of territory.

If black was giving up this side of the board anyway, this move would be better at c9.]
;W[ng];B[pj];W[pm];B[om];W[cj]C[A punishing blow to black on the left now. This game is nearly over from potential alone.]
;B[hq];W[kp]C[This move was the beggining of the end for me. I felt too weak to stop this invasion at any time.

That would be because you were. The stones around the bottom left corner are thin and have the inherent flaw of g4. They have no eyes of their own and white's stones can easily live by retreating into the corner.

The bottom right corner has weakness in the threat to cut on either side of p3. That and a live shape by white above give white all the advantages here.

Notice how white settled his stone at d7 by extending to c10 before beginning this attack. He can anticipate your undivided attention to this fight because his positions are so secure. While you are struggling for life he can take one of two benefits. Either kill your stones and secure territory, or build great influence to use in securing territory elsewhere.]

;B[qq]C[This move, and the resulting horror in the corner are necessitated by the weakness around p3.]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[ee];W[ic];B[jb]C[Big mistake. Saw it just a move late.]

C[This gave me the kill, but disregarded the K6 attack.]
(;W[he]C[A silly response by white, walking into the snap-back. Better to take the ladder at f18 for the sure kill.]
;B[hf];W[gf]C[Even more silly. No reason for white to push this to its conclusion, white should use sente to play elsewhere or secure the corner.]

;B[lg];W[mh];B[mg];W[nh];B[li]C[Here I tried to protect against any white connection in the center board.

Admirable, but a flawed strategy. White does not need any center connection. All his groups live on their own. Your strategy, then, should be to connect *your* stones in the center. Worry about his after yours are safe.]
;W[cp]C[White secures his corner territory in preparation for another attack. When you see an opponent make a move like this, you must look to your own defenses. The only reason he is taking this move is because it shores up a weakness of his. He can't run to the right any more. Now that the group is safe, he can begin to pick at your weaknesses.]
;B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[en];B[eo];W[bm];B[ek]C[Was it too close?

Not so much too close as in the wrong direction. White's group is fairly well settled. You responded exactly has he hoped to the moves to settle the corner. Now your stones around there are stiff and heavy. The cut at h6 threatends to bring down the whole group. Even if he doesn't capture those stones, the threat allows him flexibility to live.]
;W[dk];B[el];W[em];B[dl];W[cl];B[fm];W[fn];B[gn];W[ej]C[His group in the bottom center is now cut off pretty well from his other groups. This is a time where you must make choices about what is important. Are the three stones being threatened on the left more important than the large territory you'd gain if you can kill his bottom group?

See the variation for how you might otherwise respond to this move by white.]

(;B[fk];W[im];B[hm];W[il];B[iq]C[This is a weak move as it doesn't improve your position and promotes white eyeshape.]

(;B[gj]C[This move killed me just a little later. But I don't see an answer much better. When did that awful position started?

This position started about 20 moves ago. Now that you're here, your likely best response is shown in the variation.]

;W[es];B[gs];W[dr];B[cn];W[cm];B[gq]C[Here I tried to get eyes, without much result.

Yes, it is hopeless for you here.];W[ir];B[ll];W[kl];B[ik];W[hl]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[jl]C[Was it a good choice? I was trying to kill this group since a lot of time.

This group already has two eyes. White ensured that when he played j2. The eye at k4 is false, yes, but he has eyes at L3 and k2 easily. So this move would make, at best, a good ko threat.]
;W[jm];B[lk];W[kj];B[lj];W[ki];B[kh];W[hj]C[This Z shape cost me too much twice. I'll think before doing it again.

Yes, it is a bad shape formed out of two bad shapes. The "empty triangle" formed by stones like j9, k9 and k8 is bad by itself, too.]
;B[ii];W[gi]C[And I resigned after the connection. I thougt the low left group was dead. And I always feel that I get just a little territory and later lose the center because of a, one stone thick, invasion.

Your perception is flawed. White's invasion at move 70 was much more than one stone. It relied on the influence of his stones on the right, the top right, the bottom left and top left. All his stones were working together, while yours were floating about aimlessly.

You must remember that a single go stone, like the solitary soldier, is weak. Only with the support of others and the direction of a good general does the effort of the soldier aid the full battle. You lost the focus of your strategy, or blindly played the Chinese opening without understanding it in the first place.

I would highly recommend a book called "Direction of Play" if you can find it. It explains more about what I say when I talk about how go stones develop naturally in certain directions.

I hope my review is helpful to you. If you need clarification of any of the points, feel free to contact me by email.]
