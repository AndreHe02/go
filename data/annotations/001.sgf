[hp]M[fl][dl]C[W 10 seems to be the wrong direction.  When black plays DIAMOND white  TRIANGLE is put in an uncomfortable position.  Meanwhile, the white stones in  the lower side were already strong, and didn't really need the reinforcement.

Instead, white 10 at DIAMOND seems natural.];B[cq];W[cr];B[fl];W[ej]C["b" is the usual way to take advantage  of white's weak shape...]

(;B[gj]C[Black 15 threatens to seal in the white  side group, which would be bad for white.  Yet both sides give up chances to  seal in / get out.]

(;W[dj]C[White 16 allows black to seal him in, which would give Black a nice  fat moyo on the upper side, and give white almost nothing...]

(;B[ci]C[Letting  white out like this is a mistake.];W[ei];B[eh];W[fh]M[dg]C[If black isn't  planning to cut when white plays 20, he would be better off just playing  TRIANGLE to begin with (instead of this hane move).]
;B[eg];W[gi]M[eh]C[As  it was, the h
ane of black 19 (TRIANGLE) seems to help white and weaken black on the  outside.  Meanwhile, the territorial gain of having the black stones up on  the fourth line instead of one at d13 is negligable.]
;B[fj];W[fi];B[hi]M[ij]C[This hane (B 25) creates a cutt
ing point in black's (already somewhat thin) shape and doesn't put any  particular pressure on white, since W has plenty of liberties.  Just jumping  to TRIANGLE would be better.

Black should note that pressing as hard as possible directly against the  oponent's stones isn't necessarily the strongest way to attack.]
;W[fg];B[ef];W[en];B[eo];W[gm]C[Because playing "a" immediately gets a little grim  for black, he could consider playing b first.]

(;B[fm];W[fn];B[gn];W[go];B[hn];W[dn];B[co]
(;W[cn];B[bp]C[White "b" instead of "a"  gives ko to kill black.]
(;W[br];B[bn];W[bm];B[am];W[bl];B[dp];W[eq];B[bq]C[Although white might have  been able to kill black if he had tried a little harder, he can be satisfied  with forcing black to live like this, too.]
;W[hj];B[hm]M[hl]C[The geta at TRIANGLE  would be a lot better b
ecause it captures with one move, while the ladder of 49 leaves the threat of  pulling the white stone out.]
;W[ij];B[ii];W[jj];B[il];W[jh]C[Because  black has to go back to reinforce his other group, he loses his central  cutting stones, which is of course a disaster.  The game now looks clearly  good for white.]
;B[oq];W[lq];B[on];W[qm];B[jq]M[dc]C[This seems a little  foolhardy.

Perhaps black should just play around TRIANGLE to try to keep some  territorial balance.  Or just reinforce his center and lower right groups  somehow.]
;W[jp];B[ip];W[iq];B[kp];W[io];B[kq];W[ko];B[lp];W[lo];B[mp];W[kl]C[As a result of black's invasion, things are looking very grim for the  center group.]

;B[ln];W[mn];B[mo];W[ip]C["a" doesn't work, as seen in the game.   "b" looks promising, and leads to some trickiness, but it doesn't work  either...]

(;B[ml];W[nm];B[ol];W[om];B[pm];W[pl];B[jk];W[kk];B[hk]C[Alternatively (to killing black with a), white could just go for  compensation at this point with "b"...   
When black gets himself into trouble like this, the choices are all white's.]

(;W[gl];B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[ji];B[ik];W[nl];B[mk];W[lk];B[pn]M[ok]C[After the  center dies like this, the game is really over.  It seems to me that white  should capture with TRIANGLE instead of taking the three stones with "a", but  it hardly matters at this poi
nt.

After this there were still some strange moves by both sides, but at any  rate, white should win easily.
