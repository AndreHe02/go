C[Hello! I would like to have some advices and notes about my moves. I think I`m really bad in end game and in the game starting I`m really confused.
Thank you very much!

Caio

Hi,

I enjoyed watching your game. You have a lot of good ideas. There are two things that I’ll recommend off the top. 
1. Make sure that you always play the largest move that you can. 
2. Try not to fight too early in the game. During the open game, play in the open space and always be mindful of the status of each of your groups “am I able to live in the space that is available to me”.]

(;B[ob];W[od]C[In my opinion I won the game because this move. But in the end game I could have lost. What do you think?

I actually think you won the game beccause you were the first to start to play big territory moves instead of localized fighting. Move 92 was great.Go back to 92 and ask yourself. "If I'm black, how am I going to invade". When you make a very nice Moyo, it gives you the upper hand when the fighting starts. however, if both black and white ignore makeing a moyo, then the winner usually is the one who can fight better.]

Well done. You are going to be a good player. Think big moves and don't play anything that isn't needed and you will be in single digets soon.

Don't worry too much about life at this point. if back takes A you can take B and visa versa.]
