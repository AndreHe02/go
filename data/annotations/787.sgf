C[Hello, I am black in this game. I lost clearly after 166, I resigned.
There must be an enormous amount of mistakes I did, but probably I did
four major blunders, one around the upper right fight (node 12),
one along the upper edge,   one along the left edge (node 74-100),
one in the lower right corner (see node 54 and following: is my
variation the correct answer ?)

I would already be very glad to hear about these blunders, and also a
general comment on the wroung mindset that must lie behind them.

Thx. Michel Decre (MiGo on IGS)

Michel,

I have played through your game, and made some comments. Of the four
areas you describe, the one at 54 is the smallest---you came very
close to coming out well from that one. The other three would have
gone better for you had you thought more in terms of walls. In the
area around 12, your goal should have been to strengthen your stone
o16 stone, aiming to wall white off from the center. In saving your
upper middle stones, your goal should have been to make a beeline for
your strength in the upper left corner, playing to cut off the white
k17 stone and not letting yourself get blocked in. In the play after
move 74, the way you needed to analyse the situation was "If I play
low, white will not only get a local stronghold, he'll shut me off
from the entire left side! So I'd better play high, and not get cut
off from all that."

You can read my micro-comments throughout the game, but this is the
strategic idea I think you need: the importance of isolating the enemy
groups, and the value of not getting cut off yourself.

Best of luck to you.

;W[pb];B[nd]C[Here I wasn't able to figure out the correct answer. I realized p18 was bad,
and I intended to "punish" white p17, but didn't know how to react against q18
I felt r18 would be small....

First, r18 isn't small, because white r17 is tremendous. As a second
choice, your move is okay, forcing white to make territory while you
make influence. If that is your goal, though, you should follow it up
with n16 at some point, because your o16 stone becomes weak.]
;W[nc];B[qb];W[oa];B[rc]C[Here's where i would play n16. while r18 was not small, especially
after the o16-o17 exchange, at this point you didn't need another move
to cover it.];W[qa];B[ra]C[This move is also irrelevant. If you were willing to give up the
whole corner by letting white in at r17, why fight over miserable
little chunks of it now?];W[od];B[pa];W[ob];B[md]C[Too late. He's through your line. Better to extend your position at
p15 or q15, and let him waste moves dealing with your stone.]
;W[mc];B[ld];W[pe];B[qe];W[qd];B[qc];W[qf]C[In situations like this, extending your stone is almost always
better than capturing. Why let him get in a move like s15?]
;B[rd];W[of];B[ne]C[Why peep when the answer doesn't help you? At this point you don't
know if you'll need that liberty later, and if the move is ever good,
you'll get a chance to play it, so don't burn your bridges now.]
;W[oe];B[lc]C[b:this is probably a mistake, k16 better?

Only in the sense that it simplifies the position, like your last
move. It is good, though, in the sense that it supports a subsequent
move to k16.];W[lb];B[kb];W[la];B[kc];W[kf]TR[kb][kc][lc][ld]
[md][nd][ne]C[B:I think W L14 is big, it nearly already kills the marked black
group. In the equence that lead to that, I felt compelled to chase
white while hoping to build a wall towards the center. L14 suddenly
threatens the plan.

So follow up on your earlier L18-17 moves, and attack the K17 stone.
At least you'll keep your group, and claim some territory on the left.

Incidentally, it's no good chasing a group when it's alive on the
outside at P14-R14.

The following until W #46 is very poor from my side.   Do you have comments ?]
;B[jd];W[ic]
(;B[gc]C[Be consistent. This is better at j16, not letting white to connect
in the center. Consider how different the game will be in the variation.]
;W[id];B[jb];W[ib];B[he]C[Interesting. You claim some territory on the left while forcing
white to get closer to killing your group. Once again, this probably
falls under the "burning bridges" category: don't do until you're sure.]
;W[ie];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[ql];B[on];W[pn];B[po];W[pm]C[b: I think the variation is ok.

Yes, but you can do better with what you did also. See ahead.]

(;B[pr]C[White should get in the move p5 here while he has the opportunity.
It steals a march on black, and puts you on the defensive.]

board, you might get some use out of them, e.g., by threatening o4.]
;W[ms];B[qs];W[os];B[pr]C[I hope you realize this was a totally wasted move. You give up
sente, for zippo.];W[cg]C[b: Here starts a new fight.

Yes, showing that h15 didn't do too much after all.];B[ci];W[di]
;B[dj]C[Your choice with this and the next few moves seems odd. You go for
the edge territory, and just extend your corner, surrendering to white
both the center bits and the left edge. My preference here would be
just to extend to c10. White's group is terribly weak, so he needs to
waste a move there, and then you can extend down the edge. If you're
going to play d10 and allow the cut, at least you want to cut off
white's c13 stone, and get territory around f14, making use of your
earlier plays.];W[cj];B[bi];W[ck];B[bg];W[ej]
(;B[ch]C[This move serves no purpose. You're already connected to your upper
stones, and if you want to put pressure on c13, play d12 now, and
follow it up. See the variation.]
(;W[dg]C[I don't like white's move much, either. Under proper black play, he
shouldn't be able to save the c13 stone, so he'd be better off using
it to push deep into your territory. See the variation.];B[dh]
;W[dk]
(;B[ei]C[Why did you do this? You seem enamoured of these diagonal
non-connections, especially useless kos. Look at the variation, and
see again how strong the straight extension is.];W[eh];B[dj]
;W[fi];B[di];W[fg];B[ef];W[eg];B[df]TR[dk][ej][fi][fg][ie][kf]
[of][qf][np][mq][cq]C[This is mildly better on the f14 side, to support yourself against
white's presence. Still, this was a big loss for black. Look at how
the marked stones isolate you from most of the board. You have one
window at p6, and you'd better do something along the lower edge.]
;W[fk];B[bk]C[Where is this going?];W[bl];B[bj];W[hg]C[b: What a cluster of black stones for little territory while white
has influence everywhere!! I fight along the edges, make poor
territory, and help my opponent to build influence and make a sure win
through the center....how can I avoid this ?

Good observation. The way you can avoid this is to always keep it in
mind. When a new area starts, or a fight breaks out, take a moment at
the beginning of the fight to decide where you want to end up. With
the fight on the left, My choice would have been to let white have a
small group, and claim lots of frontage along the left edge. With the
issue at the top, your goal should have been to push the J17 stones
along the edge, connecting up over them and having the view of the
center.

When you have a free move, like at 95, and you're considering
finishing the current battle, ask youself if this is settled enough
already, and who will gain if you force a conclusion (white got to
finish his wall at b8), and are there more important things to do.]
;B[lf]C[b:From here on I will try desperately to create some influence to
the center and keep k18-o15 alive :(];W[mf]
(;B[le]C[To save these stones, you need to be bolder. Always try to keep
running, as quickly as you can. Don't connect if you don't need to.
See the variation.];W[lg];B[if];W[je];B[ke]C[Again, a useless ko. You know this isn't an eye, right?]

;W[jg];B[mb];W[ih]C[The past 25 moves, from about 105, are all very strange to me. You
both seem content to fight a little border war here, with the expected
conclusion after white's 104. That is, black is dead at the top, and
white gets to close off between l14 and f11. This all could have been
ignored, on either of your parts.];B[hd];W[bf];B[mh]LB[kh:a]
[sh:b][sj:c][ok:d][no:e][ko:f][kk:g]C[b: Look at the disaster !!!! White has cut at b14, reinforced his
influence, black edge b13-b9 is virtually dead, etc, etc. With B n12,
I want to build a living group somewhere between a/b/c/d/e/f/g

Look at the ensuing disaster.

The biggest problem with this plan is it's trying to make a
desperation center before all the edges are gone. The entire lower
side between c3 and n3 is wide open. That's where you should be trying
to make something new.];W[mg];B[mj]C[should be closer to p6. white has stones around you, you need to get
out fast. The initial peep on the far side is okay, but your next move
should be a solid extension, that is guaranteed to go somewhere. Try
to alternate between reckless and cautious. You can't build on thin air.]
;W[ml];B[pj];W[qj];B[ol]TR[mh][mj][pj][on]C[b:Look here. I make a knight's move, naively hoping to be able to
connect the marked stones. The result in next comment.];W[ok]
C[b:there he goes....];B[pk];W[pl];B[om];W[qk];B[oj]C[This was your big chance! If it looks doubtful that you'll save all
your stones, look to sell some to keep the rest. And above all, never
cooperate with the enemy in walling yourself in. Once he gets o9-p9
solid, you'll never get through.];W[nk];B[mk];W[nj]C[He gives you another chance. If he just plays o8 connecting, your
upper stones are all gone.];B[nl];W[ni];B[mi];W[pi];B[mn];W[lm]
;B[ll];W[mm]
(;B[lk]C[Better would be to extend the live stuff at m6. It threatens to kill
the three white stones, and at the same time, gets you into the action
on the bottom, which is where you want to be.];W[km];B[ji]C[This is dead already. Don't throw good stones after it.]
;W[ki];B[lh];W[kh];B[jh];W[kg]C[b: In the whole sequence, I have tried to seek oxygen and breath : useless.
White was sticking to me and strangling every move. How come I coldn't help it?

Because you had nowhere to run. The center is no place to make
territory from scratch, especially if your opponent has all the nearby
stones. You are much better off building from a side, or pushing from
an existing group. If you must try out in the middle of nowhere, float
like a butterfly. Keep your moves spaced out. It gives you more
options, and keeps your opponent trying to chase where you aren't.
Every time you play a stone too close to one of your other stones, you
give the opponent a chance to close a door on you. But much better not
to get into this situation in the first place. See comments at move
100, for example.

Many thanks for your review :)        -- You're welcome.

I have a lot to learn.                -- Good luck to you.
