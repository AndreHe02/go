C[I played black.

I already found several mistakes and marked them. But they were not that big I think.

What I would like to know is, what I could do completely different, because I can't see myself getting any better lately.

Shaydwyrm:

I've answered as many of your questions as I can.

As for what you could do completely different, I would say counting or at least estimating the score will make the biggest difference to your game right now.  Knowing whether you are ahead or behind, and by how much, will allow you to know when it's time to settle in and spend a move defending.  This will keep the game from getting complicated when you don't want it to.  Check the comments on move 59 for more on this.]

;B[fr];W[ds];B[fq]C[Shaydwyrm:  No reason not to play G3 here.  It adds eyeshape to your group and narrows the gap between your wall and Q4 slightly more.]
;W[kq];B[mq]C[Is this move correct?

Shaydwyrm:  This is absolutely the correct move.  Because this is such a perfect move, L3 is a mistake (it should be at M3 or N3, if he must play a move in this area).]
;W[hq];B[lo];W[jp];B[lr]C[This one better at k6 and try to wall in white?

Shaydwyrm:  Yes, I think K6 is a better approach.  Even if white gets to play near the edge first, it still won't be enough to ensure life, and it will definitely be gote.  At that point you can play O14 or O15 and your moyo on the right looks extremely imposing.]
;W[jn];B[ko]C[Shaydwyrm:  I don't think there's a good reason to play this peep, especially since it looks like it might be more useful from the other side.]
;W[jo];B[ll];W[go];B[fo];W[gn];B[jl]C[Shaydwyrm:  Note that the J5 peep looks like it could be useful now.]
;W[kr];B[cf];W[fd];B[di];W[qj]
(;B[ql]C[Is this the right direction?

Shaydwyrm:  I think it's not, mainly because you are thick on the bottom right now, not on the top.  You should attack from your weak side, so that those stones get stronger in the process.  See the variation.]
;W[qg];B[ne];W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[rk]C[Shaydwyrm:  Again, this may not be the ideal move for attacking.  However, black is very far ahead on territory right now, so moves like this should be enough to win.  Since you have already leaned on the top, hitting on top of these stones also looks reasonable.]

C[Shaydwyrm:  This is a wasted move if it's not sente.  The area in the middle is too wide to enclose like this, with G8 and the top still open.  This might be a good time to invade the upper side, if you are inclined to do that, but first I would count the score.  

You have almost 50 points in the lower right that are secure, and maybe 20 points on the left side, although you will need to spend another move there.  Meanwhile, white has 14 points in the lower left, maybe 10 on the right side, and another 10 secured on the top, plus whatever comes out of the top left (not secure territory yet.  In other words, at this point, you are way, way ahead, to the tune of 30+ points.  Thus, you can afford to play conservatively and take solid territory.  E14, or maybe bB16 wC17 bE14, is a good way to start, eliminating some bad aji in your position.  Alternately, Q18 also looks good - takes another 10 points in the corner, and with the invasion in the middle of the top still open, is probably sente against white's group on top.  

Note that the profit from your great thickness in the lower left came out in the lower right, and in the moyo you made on the left side.]

;W[rq];B[sp];W[so];B[rs];W[po];B[nn]C[Shaydwyrm:  This move is a bit loose.  White is pretty stuck here, there's no reason to leave any holes for him to play with.  P5 is enough.]

C[I should have played this one elsewhere.
C17 maybe?

Shaydwyrm:  For sure, but C17 is better at B16 (where you ended up playing in a few moves).  C17 does too much damage to your C14 stone.]
;W[ic];B[bd];W[cc];B[gl]C[Shaydwyrm:  This move seems nice at first glance.  It threatens the bottom side group and also looks at enclosing a lot of middle territory with a follow-up at E14, or maybe at J15 first.  However, because L1 and G2 are available for white's bottom side group, you're unlikely to be able to kill it, so unfortunately it doesn't look like this is sente.  Too bad that sequence in the bottom right left that aji behind...]
;W[fg]C[Shaydwyrm:  This move kinda demands a response, as it makes your left side look thin.  It should really be almost a thank-you move, if you respond at D13 or so - it takes away a big potential weakness, and doesn't make much territory for white.]
;B[is];W[js];B[hs];W[ir];B[gr];W[hr];B[gs];W[ks];B[rp]C[This was also wrong I think, only some points in gote.

Shaydwyrm:  Right.];W[bk];B[bl]C[B11 instead of this one?

Shaydwyrm:  Yes, it looks like the consequence of ignoring F13 is having to fall back to B11 here.  As an alternative to B11, trying E14 is also worth a look - if white connects at F14, you can come back and play B8; if not, you cut off F13 and potentially make a big chunk of center territory.]
;W[ch]C[Shaydwyrm:  F13 makes this invasion much more severe.  It's a tough position, and it's hard for me to say if there's anything more you could have done.  It looks like there are some possibilities starting with C11 here.]
