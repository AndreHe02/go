**********************
hi, my name is joerg, i am a 5kyu player from germany. I am not particularly strong at handicap games, but I hope my comments help. I included some variations. There are probably not what a pro would recommend but I think they are examples of better ways to play in certain situation.

Have fun!];W[dd];B[dg]C[*******************
I think that a more direct attack (kakari) e.g. c14 or a shimari e.g. c6 is better. k4 or k16/k17 might be good as well. But your move is neither attack nor defense.]
;W[cn]C[**************
correct: white does not need to answer blacks move on d13];B[fq]
C[***********************
looks like wrong direction for me.  You should try to utilize your stone on d13 with a pincer attack e.g. on c9.]
;W[bp];B[cq]C[*********************
again, c3 is too passive. It is clear that white wants to extend on the left edge because he can simultanously settle his lower left group an launch a pincer attack on blacks lone stone on d13. C8 would be better here.]
;W[cj]C[**********************
white c10 is a little too far wawy from c6 to be safe. C8 would be still possible for black.]

(;B[gd]C[*********************
this is not attacking enough (again). F17 would be the proper attack. Or with the support from D13, black could try C16...]
;W[cc];B[md]C[***********************
you leave your stones alone. You should help them with K17 or L17.]
;W[jc];B[kp]C[**************************
this is a nice move. I would have preferred K4 for two reasons:
1) it is the right distance to the left group
2) if white invades on R3, black can built a wall facing k4, which then has just the right distance.]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[******************
this joseki is good for protecting the corner, but white can settle very easily. Black has more stones around and should play more actively.]
;W[pn];B[np];W[pj]C[***************************
look at the board: white has caught up, but black is still ahead. Black should now attack where white is weak and simultanously strengthen his weak groups. What about E15 or H17?]
;B[pg]C[*********************
Playing always on the fourth line won't work.Either black should protect the corner with R14 or attack with R12. To attack with R12, N16 should be at O16. Now black suffers from the too widely placed stones.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb]C[*****************************
That could be an opportunity. White should play on S15.]
(;B[ob];W[qa]C[*******************
white plays rubbish here. punish!!!!]

too passive (see variation)];W[rf];B[rg];W[sd];B[id];W[hc];B[ic]
;W[ib];B[jd];W[kc];B[kd];W[lc];B[ld];W[gc]C[**********************************
white has played too passive here and black gets a very impressive wall.]
;B[mg]C[*******************************
walls should not be used to make territory. walls are good to push the enemy against. Balck 42 is too narrow. See how little territory black gets for such a lot of stones. With this huge wall in the back, black should straightly attack with O10. Don't be scared!]
;W[mb]C[************************
this is a wasted move]
(;B[gg]C[*********************
not wasted, but meaningless. If black wants to connect  -> see variation]
;W[hd];B[he];W[ge];B[gf];W[fd];B[ig]C[****************************
too narrow, too afraid. O10 is still my favourite.];W[cf]
(;B[fe]C[********************************
this move cannot win anything. G15 is of no strategic meaning, not for white and not for black. If black want to link up with D13, black must play at E14, D14 might work as well.]
;W[ee];B[hp]C[******************************
wrong place. this is not a weak spot. If white comes in here, black willbe split into two strong groups, whereas the invading white group will be on the run.

Black has only stong groups now. This is the time to attack, not to defend.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[rp]C[*******************************
black must definitely play at S5 here!!! White has then to defend the corner and black can attack the white group on the right edge.]

(;B[os]C[*****************
see variation. black could get more.];W[rr];B[gj]C[************************

why? L9 is possible. or better -> see variation];W[kk];B[jk]
;W[kl];B[lk]C[*********************
this cut does not work, the ladder favours white];W[mk];B[ll]
;W[lm];B[ml];W[nl]C[*************************
one should not start a ladder that cannot be won. this 3 stones are a huge local loss for black. Now all white stones are safe and cannot be effectively attacked.]
;B[km];W[mm];B[jl];W[po]C[**********************
now that white's group are safe, the three black stones are of no strategic value. If white kill them it is 6 points for white (3 stones and 3 territory). A move like C8 or even S11 or B3 is worth more than this.]

black should not answer here.];W[kn];B[jm];W[gl];B[ln]C[*****************

C[**************************
final comments:

- play more aggressive! Do not defend too much. Don't be scared!

- play consistently. Either a stone attacks or defends (or even better: both). Anything in between is a compromiss and will fail.

- use walls to attack. Do not make territory in front of walls.

- slip in between weak enemy groups. This is the most effective way to attack (splitting attack)

- study some corners life and death puzzles. You should see when your opponent deviates from the correct way of play and punish him/her

- in the endgame you must count the value of move and consider if the are sente or gote. Do not answer all ataries if there much bigger points still open.
