C[Dear reviewer:
I played this with White on KGS (even though I'm actually just 8k).
Please let me know what in your view caused the loss of this game:
My treatment of the opening ?
My first invasions ?
Tactical errors occurring later, leading to the loss of the left lower group ?
My failed 3,3-invasion ?
Certainly, in this game, I was far behind even before losing the final battle.

Looking forward to your comments. I speak also German.
Sincerely

(;W[lc]LB[cc:C][pc:B][rc:A]C[Up until here the game feels playable for both sides, though white is leading due to the awkward black stones on the left.

A, B, and C are all possible variations];B[mc]C[This move is obvious, but not quite as good as n18]

e10 is very slow];B[bj];W[bi];B[fm]C[since there isnt much potential for moyo at the bottom with both corners still open, better to invade]
