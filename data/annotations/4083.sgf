C[Hi, and thanks for reviewing.  I'm black in this game.  It's the first time I've been black in an even game in forever.  Everyone on KGS seems to want black.  I normally perfer white because I'd rather take the 6.5 points since we kyu players make so many mistakes, I dont think going first is that huge of an advantage.

Anyway, while the end shows that I won by a lot, it was completely by accident that I killed a large group.  I was behind for most of the game.

Thanks again!

Hi,

My name is Tom and I'll review for black (mostly) and white as well, wherre appropriate. I am Razorbrain on KGS and alsewhere, so I'll precede my comments with RB>>>.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pc];B[eq];W[kq];B[dj];W[nq]C[RB>>> White missed an opportunity to play a bigger move here. An extension from L3 is not an urgent move, as he can defend to either side if approached by black.]
;B[qn];W[pr];B[qq];W[hq];B[jc]C[RB>>> White paniced and made a base at the bottom, but all of this was unnecessary. Even affter brginning along this line of play, H3 could havve been skipped. Imagine white being able to play K17 first. Whtie should want K17 more than H3. 

I believe that this type of play happens when players are not comfortable  with local life and death situations. So, the moral here is practive life and death problems, a lot! It will help you play better and help you recongize how to punish an opponent for fearful play.]
;W[fc];B[nc];W[qe];B[ne]C[RB>>> I would have played N17 rather than o17. Even after a follow up play like o15, black's shape can be attacked severely. Also this is not sente. Imagine o17 at n17. This shape can live at the top or run out and do so AFTER white makes another move. In the mean time black should look for bigger moves on the right or left sides.]
;W[cg];B[qi];W[qg];B[ci];W[dm]
(;B[fm]LB[bm:A]C[I wasn't sure what to do with this stone.  It was played high, so capturing it didn't seem likely, but playing under it would lead to white influence facing the center from this position and would lead to an easy attack on my bottom left corner.  I decided to take the low chance of capture with hopes of at least making good influence towards the middle.

RB>>> Hmmmm . . . F7 is a mistake. However, the start of your analysis was fine. You noticed that white stone was played high, going for influence and reduction. Your desire to try to capture it is a bit desperate.  You cannot stop this reduction unless you are playing from strength. What is interesting here is that it is not your corner that is weak. The Shimari here is quite strong. It is the C11 group that worries me as black. These stones do not have a base and are open to severe attack. So, any attack you play against the D7 stone will lose its punch because white will be able to counter attack against your two stones. This pressure will allow white to escape.

i would not worry about white's gained influence here. You can still counteract it. So if you connect at 'A' for example and white plays out to F7 instead, you still have plays at F5 or G4 that threaten to cut these two stones. While white works to connect you can cancel his influence in the center.  (See Variation)]
;W[ek];B[el];W[dk];B[dl];W[ck];B[cl];W[bk]C[well, I got the stone, but things aren't looking too good.  It seemed like I was going to be short on territory, so I decided to pull out my two stones first, and then invade the top left corner.]
;B[fi];W[ej];B[ei];W[gk]C[RB>>> Now we havve a running battle with both white and black working to save a group, which both should be able to do, but this is loss of a big opportunity for black.]

(;B[db];W[bb];B[bc];W[ca];B[ab];W[ad];B[ba];W[aa]C[I probably could have gotten the corner without ko, but I couldn't see another way.  I ended up losing a lot of territory in the left side for my small corner at the top.

See the variation at move 47. the ko was unnecessary.];B[pd]

;W[cn];B[dn];W[co];B[do];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq];B[no];W[qk]C[now if I dont get this stone, I'm going to be really short on territory...

RB>>> Again, think defense before offense. While offense is often the best defense, remember that in go moves that look defensive can be strategically offensive. It is sort of like deploying a missle defense system. If you opponent doesn't have one, then that seemingly defensive movev makes your offense cacpabilities shine. 

The o5 move is tempting, it's true, however, without strength near p11 first, it is not as easy to use. For me these subtlties of the middle game we (are :-) hard to grasp sometimes, but good judgement in situations like this can and do make or break games.]

RB>>> I'm glad you finally attacked these stones on the right. next time learn to do it on purpose :-)]
;W[mq];B[lp];W[mm];B[lq];W[lr];B[nl]C[I think if he gives up the left stones, he can at least save the right stones.]

Anyway, thanks again for reviewing!

RB>>> Thanks for asking for a review. It is a great way to learn. Hopefully my comments have given you a few things to think about. I highly recommend do tsumego for 15-20 minutes daily. It will help you judge the health of your groups as well as win important fights and is perhaps the most important thing you'll need to make it to 10k besides plenty of playing.

Good luck. Let me know if you havve any fofllow up questions.

(;B[lk]C[RB>>> Imagine getting this cut in! First white cannot ignore it, but even if the eventual sequence ends in gote for black, white cannot hurt black in the top right.]
;W[ll];B[kk];W[kj];B[kl];W[mm];B[jk];W[jj];B[km];W[ij];B[lo]
C[RB>>> Now white is hurting bad . . Ooops I almost forgot, what about the upper right? I hope you see from this that you need consider urgency in your moves very carefully. Learn to look around for opportunities often, even if quickly. Keep sente in mind. Always look for ways to push you opponent. Finish this variation for a look at the upper right.]

TR[ne][jc][qi]C[This is just one option.

White is also faced with running towards plenty of black stones (marked).]
