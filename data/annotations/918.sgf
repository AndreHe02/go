C[Hello, and thank you for allowing me to benefit from your  learning. I won this game (I play white) but I feel as if it  were on a technicality: the black group around C13 was  easy prey because of my opponents mis-read/priority.

xinjia-hi thx. Often times I lose to 12k because of a misread :)]
;B[pd];W[dp]LB[dc:a][cq:b]C[Personally I feel this is a mistake. Since black is going for influence with q16, trying to get influence with d4 is a mistake. I would personally prefer a (trying to trick black into moving at d4 or b, in whch case you move q3) or b, in which case you move at r4 or a depending on your opponent's moves. This has the effect of balancing his influence with your solid territory. But enough of that :)]
;B[pq];W[ed]C[I'm beginning to see a lot of value in playing the 5-4.
I feel as if I may have made some poor choices in  utilizing it in this game. I felt confident throughout the
whole game, however, I would have lost for sure were it  not for my opponents greed.

xinjia says: I don't understand thr 5-4 and don't reccomend it because of that. It is an influence oriented move and is even worse in holding no to the corner than d 16. As black I would immediately invade the c17 point and especially due to the q16 stone I feel I would come out ahead in some way.

Due to black's q3, i feel e16 is suicide.];B[cn];W[ck]C[It's often better to avoid pincers until you are 9k on IGS. The reason for this is that it's impossible to know the right pincer and/or response to a pincer.]
;B[bp]C[This is a good example. Just c3. Whatever he seems to gain he will quickly lose no matter his response.]
;W[gq]C[The incredible badness of this manouvre becomes apparent after black d3.]
;B[cq]C[o.k. but d3 is better];W[mc]C[You need to think of safety first. Don't attack 10 points if you can defend 8 points (or at this stage of the game, defend 20 pts for example with c16)

d2 springs to mind as an interesting alternative too];B[cf]
C[Now you see why it was better to defend than attack. Your opponent's attack (since he moves after you) is always more. But if you defend, since you defended first, he has only a very small number of attacking opportunities.]
;W[ef]C[c16 is the obvious move here. e14 is not the best.]
;B[ci]C[Black should have moved at c16.];W[jd];B[cc];W[ce]C[I rather like the last three moves because they reflect on the  flexibility of playing on the 5-4, however, I soon have a  foundationless group of stones there.


xinjia says: Yes-- the 5-4 doesen't go for territory (foundation).]

;B[gc];W[gd];B[he];W[ic];B[hc];W[jf]C[Why are you concerned about this group when f13 is probably a better group to jump out from?

Try this strategy: Before you make a move just ask yourself "Which is the weakest group", and then move from that group. If you have no weak groups, then ask yourself "Where can I invade"? If you CAN'T invade easily, REDUCE. trying to invade an area that is too well defended only helps your opponent.]
;B[hg];W[eh]C[This group is not really in danger yet. I reccomend q17. way bigger.]
;B[ih];W[pc]C[good but I would have moved here as black on the last move.]
;B[qc];W[pg];B[qf];W[qg];B[pf];W[od];B[qb];W[pe]C[this is terrible. It has the idea of allowing black p14. If you moved p14, he couldn't get out.]
;B[qd];W[of];B[qe];W[oj]C[o.k. but floating. After black r8 you have a problem.

There is still the problem of black p15...];B[og];W[oh];B[ng]
;W[pm]C[This is a];B[oe];W[ne]C[I don't understand. Why not move at o14 (sacrifice) then if he moves o15 (a worthless move) you can force at o12 and attack/enclose at l12 or similar..]
;B[nf];W[me]C[isn't worth much. r5 is the move here.];B[qo]
;W[pi]C[you need to move at r6.

Ok I think this demonstrates your biggest problem well. Your biggest problem is that you let your stones float. You need to secure territory. Right now you have very little territory in comparison to your opponent.]

;B[ik];W[jk];B[ii];W[jj];B[mh]C[
My rule is, if you have 3 escape routes, you can ignore an attack. Black has 3 routes here so n12 is not a very good move. I would prefer something along the lines of h7 and killing that lower white group or o9 and killing the white group there :) iff possible.]
;W[gk]C[It looks like white cuts black off but this is not the case as you will see shortly.]
;B[hk];W[gl];B[hm];W[gm];B[ei]C[If black moves at d5 or d8 he should be able to connect in sente.]

So I guess you have to ask yourself this question.... Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya? :)))))
