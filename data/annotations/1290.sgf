;B[pd]C[*Kmpeter  (14K*) was black and guild (14k*) was white]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[ed]C[*I have no  reason to think that this is a reasonable opening, but I was experimenting  with it for a while.

Experimentation is *always* good! It is the best way to learn, and to have  fun!]
;B[pj];W[cd]C[*If I played on the 5-4 point, I probably should have  approached q16 instead of playing c16

I dont think we can call c16 bad.  Especially with komi -- it gives you a  firm base to operate from.  It also compells a b play around c10 -- so you  are placed in control of the games flow.

Retaining sente will be key -- w needs to get a play in around k10 after  this.  As it is, the enclosure is vulnerable to being "scooped out" by a b  approach around g17.]
;B[cj]C[
This is required.  w c10 would be unimaginably bad for black.  If you dont  like this posistion, then you shouldnt play c16.]
;W[cm]C[
c7 is timid.  c8 is correct.  (the approach from c12 can be considered as  well)

c8 is better because it puts more pressure on c10.

It is a given that b must jump or extend after c7/c8.  c8 would be better  placed to attack the resulting structure.

Playing c8 can be unnerving, because it leaves the possibility of a black  invasion at c6.  This is not to be feared! if w c8, b c6, then w d6.  There  are several ways things can go from here -- I leave these for you to  explore.]
;B[cg];W[jp]C[
I would prefer an extension along the top -- perhaps even an approach  against q16.  Guarding against an approach on the lower right is not as  urgent -- for example b f3, w d3/e3, b f4,  pincer seems good for w.  W has  pressure on the f3 group, and a nice structure in the corner.

As things stand, the upper left feels very vulnerable -- especially since  c13 blocks extension down the side.]
;B[dr]C[*I'm not sure how to respond to  this play

Niether am I! :-)

My instinct is c3.  Black will be forced to extend along the side and make  meager life.  W will gain secure territory in the corner, and make thickness  on the 3rd or 4th line above the black stones.]
;W[eq]C[
I am uncomfortable with e3.  It doesnt seem to work well with c7, and doesnt  block d2 from expanding along the side once he stabilizes in the corner.   W's prospective thickness seems cramped and turned in on  itself.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[cq];W[bo]C[
Leaving the cut at d5 makes me nervous.  On the other hand, b5 is the only  way I see to pressure the b stones in the corner.  I think this shows e3 was  misplayed.

Also -- note how much nicer it would be if c7 were at c8.];B[er]
;W[fq];B[br];W[nq]C[
Again -- I prefer the top.  Especially since an invasion along the bottom  can count on support from e2.]
;B[fr];W[gq];B[bp]C[
b4 is too small for now.];W[el]C[
Again -- an extension along the top would be better.  The cut at d5 (for now  at least) is can be handled by an atari then a play at e7.  (b d5, w e5, b  d6, w e7.)

To extend w's moyo on the bottom, d9 is better.  It places more pressure on  the black stones above and maps out more territory.]
;B[ej];W[gr]C[
The top is still bigger.];B[gc]C[
:-(];W[fb]C[*was this the correct move?

I'm not sure.  It feels loose -- b has many forcing moves in and around the  corner.]
;B[kc];W[nd]C[*in light of L17, I didn't think the knight's approach would  be good.

That's the right kind of thinking!  I'm not sure it is correct, however.   l17 is perhaps more effective against o16 than o17.  o16 is a plum target  for attack, and will have much trouble finding life.  o16 has the threat  against the corner -- if b protects that with p17 -- w jumps toward the  center building some thickness.  This might be used in conjuction wiht f18  to invade the g17-l17 group.

All in all however, attacking the q4 stone might be better here.  In the  upper right, w retains the option of the corner invasion -- so matters there  are not urgent.]
;B[oc];W[qf]C[*this may have been a mistake

Yes.  The game shows why.  Making life for both these stones will be a  terrible burden.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[qi];W[pe];B[qd];W[qn]C[
o14 is now the key point for the white stones in the upper right.

The invasion at r6 is also big.];B[qo];W[pn];B[np];W[mp];B[no]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[ql];B[oq];W[ro];B[rp];W[po]C[
q5 might be a bit early.  It is clear that b can get two eyes once he plays  at r4.  Preserving the forcing move for a ko, or perhapse the invasion at r3  would be better.

Consider instead of q5: w n3, b elsewhere, w r3.  This is a powerful combo  that b will probably block -- so you'd still have sente.  n3 is probably  better than q5  . . . so q5 is probably not the best.]
;B[qp];W[rm];B[mq];W[lq];B[nr];W[mr];B[nq];W[lr];B[pl]C[
The exchange so far seems okay.

Note that your lower side is only worht 12 points.  b's upper side looks to  be around 16 points without the corner.  A play at the topp would've been  better than g2.]
;W[nn]C[
w s10, b s11, w n5 might be better than the play at o6.];B[on]
;W[om];B[oo];W[pm];B[oh];W[ng]C[
w o14 is correct shape.  It makes a much stronger structure from which to  work.]
;B[nl];W[nm];B[nj];W[ph];B[pi];W[og];B[qh];W[nh];B[pg];W[qg]
;B[ni];W[nc];B[ob];W[nb];B[od];W[oe];B[qb];W[jl]C[
k8 is the right idea. n5 is also huge.  Im not sure which is  better.]
;B[ml];W[fk];B[lm];W[km];B[ln];W[ko];B[mo];W[fj]C[
You came out ahead in the exchange after k8.];B[ei];W[bf];B[bg]
C[*I probably  shouldn't leave b14 like that.

No -- it is fine.  There are many urgent places.  If b14 is captured it isnt  wasted, the aji it creates will help secure the corner.  These exchanges  since k5 are probalby what won the game for you.]
;W[bk]C[
Another nice one.

But -- imagine if you had played c8 instead of c7.  Then you could play much  more agressively here.]
;B[bj];W[re]C[
A jump out towards the center would be better.  Black is weak along the top  -- you must attack this weakness and make life through that attack in  sente.]
;B[so];W[rn];B[rk];W[rj];B[qj];W[rl];B[sj];W[ri];B[rh];W[sk]
C[
Good! You made life! You knew you could, and didnt go back to add a stone  earlier.  This is another key point in the game.]
;B[rd];W[rg]C[
s13 is bad.  It creates no eye, and it compels b t12, w t11 costing you  sente.  Again -- the jump to the center is the key.]
;B[sh];W[si];B[me];W[ne]C[
Now, you are in trouble! Being forced to protect that cut is painful! But  after n15 you had no choice]
;B[mf];W[lh]C[
Good! Making an eye at o14 would be suicide.  The jump to the center is  correct.]
;B[nf];W[of];B[ke];W[ld];B[jf];W[kd];B[jd];W[lc];B[jc];W[kb]
;B[jb];W[ka];B[ja];W[mb];B[md];W[lg];B[le];W[lj]C[
Another good move.];B[ki];W[li];B[kk];W[kj];B[jk];W[ik];B[jj]
;W[ji];B[kh];W[kg];B[jh];W[ii];B[ij];W[jg];B[ih]C[
This sequence is a good forcing sequence.  There are others in there -- but  I cant say they are better or worse.]
;W[ig];B[hi];W[hf];B[mc];W[ff]C[*I figured at this point that I would have to sacrifice  part of the group to save the rest.

Yes.  The right  choice.];B[fc];W[ec];B[gb];W[ge];B[lb];W[il]
;B[fh];W[eb];B[ck];W[be]C[
Why not c14 instead of b15?];B[bl];W[dg];B[eg];W[df];B[dh];W[hd]
;B[hc];W[ie]C[
j15 doesnt accomplish much.];B[lk]C[
Getting towards the end game.  It is worthwhile to go through and find  places you played gote -- see if there were sente plays you could've  made.]

;W[eo];B[an]C[*i thought this was a very nice  play on black's part to reduce

It is.  n19 might have been better spent over here to shore things up a bit.

Blacks sequence here is possible because of the cut at d5.  It's truly  amazing how these small defects in shape can resonate down through a  game.]

;W[lo];B[mn];W[cn];B[al];C[*Thank you for your help and comments.

You're welcome!

I hope my comments have been helpful.  Remember -- in the grand scheme of  things I suck real bad at this game -- so take everything I say with a large  grain of salt!

Key concepts though:

* Play c8 instead of c7.  This play was too timid -- you let black off easy.

* Your move at e3 would probably have worked better at c3.    It would be a  good idea to explore this variation, as well as c8.

* Black got 15 points on the top side -- you got maybe 6 from your block at  g2.  The top was more urgent.  This is the biggest strategic concept I see  that you can learn from.

* The play at o16 saddled you with a tremendous burden.  You were lucky to  come out of that scrap alive.


Hope this helps!
