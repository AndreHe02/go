C[Michael:
Hi there.  My name is Michael and I'll be reviewing your game.

Having taken a glance at the game, you are correct that you need to work on your fighting.  I'll try to show you some good moves to look for, but with fighting, in my experience it's a learn by doing sort of thing.  I would also suggest picking up a tesuji problem book and working through it.  You don't need to do hard problems, in this case quantity is what's important. :)

Rodgopolis:
Greetings, grand and powerful Go instructors,

I haven't been playing for too terribly long but I think this game is wonderfully demonstrative of my biggest pitfall: I'm bad in a fight. I feel like I lose most fights I get into, and my opponents can simply put a stone somewhere near mine and it will end in a dragon for them and sad times for me. I think the only reason I do as well as I do is my deliberate attention to whole board strategy, or at least my best approximation of whole board strategy. :) This is my first review request so I super appreciate you guys taking the time.


This was a mega friendly beginner's game. My opponent and I fight over all four corners and I lose all four then resign. How might I avoid this (sadly frequent) fate? How can I trade my Nerf bat for a chainsaw?]

(;B[jd]C[Michael: This position is the sanrensei.  I don't know how much you know about it, so I'll explain.  In this position, you're telling your opponent that you want influence, and a lot of it.  And that you're not expecting to make territory in the corners, that you're more interested in the sides and the center.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It's just important to know the meaning of your moves.]

The 3-3 invasion is small.  Usually around move 30-40 is a good time.  After the rest of the board has had a chance to develop in some way.]

A will defend your side, see variation.

(;B[mp]LB[iq:A]TR[gn]C[Right idea, but now that white's stone is on the board I'd be worried about white taking your base by jumping to A.  So I'd be looking at a lower move]

(;B[jf]C[This stone doesn't feel like it's doing enough.  It's slow, because it's not giving you much territory and it's not threatening white in any real way.]

If you throw a stone in the river it just goes around it, but if you build up a wall you can direct the flow.  By throwing a stone here you're inviting white to play at A, which would be very bad for your marked stones.  You're directing the river right through your own village!]

This isn't to say that you can *prevent* an invasion at A.  But if your opponent invades at A he or she will wind up living smaller or have a weaker group for you to chase.]
