[on:C]TR[oo]C[I am not sure whether P4 is joseki.  If it is, then ignore this comment.

The moves I know from a position like this is A or B.  Also, I think it is more common for b to play the marked stone at C when w makes a wide pincer like this.

===

As far as i know, it's not joseki, and i think i now have some idea why it's not joseki.

Odd that i see these marks; i don't see some of the later ones you mention.]

;B[mr];W[or];B[lo];W[kq]C[L3 is a bad move.  M4 is very weak, but so small that it isn't worth saving.  By adding L3 w doesn't make M4 any stronger, only bigger (and thus more painful to lose).

The whole bottom side is so strong for B that I wouldn't even play there.  Even if W manages to make life, b should be able to get more out of the fight.  If I were W I would play on the top or left sides.

===

Yes.  I was shocked at how badly my stones had been mangled, and dismayed by black's thick walls.  I didn't want to concede the lower side, and i goofed.  You suggest the top or left-- K17 or C9, C10, or C11?  Would it be poor to play on the right side, say at R7 or Q8?  Or is it best to just let black have the spoils he earned, and not provoke a fight where he is strong?

wms: R7 I don't like, because it is playing near strong b stones.  This is usually wrong, you don't ever play near strong enemy stones this early in the game.  Q8 is just weird, it doesn't look to me like it does much of anything.
K17, C9, C10, C11, F17, C5, etc...any of these look fine to me.];B[ip];W
[co];B[dl];W[eo];B[fl];W[ic]C[This is an odd time to play J17.  White's two marked stones are very weak; if b kills them, then the whole LL corner is B!  I think w should play around them, probably near the edge, to try to make life there, maybe aiming to pinch b's two stones on D8 and make a bigger group on the top of the left side.

===

Now that you point it out, i see that you are right.  (Thanks!  I'm glad i asked you for comments...  :-)  At the time, i was trying to build territory on the top that i thought would support a later invasion somewhere near C11... i thought i would be able to connect the C5 stones underneath at B8 or A8.  Needless to say, the game did not go as i would have predicted.]

C[I think this sequence was good for w, *very* good if H16 can live.

R17 is now a big move.];B[oi];W[pi];B[oh];W[pg]C[===

Is Q13 a mistake?  I was surprised when black played Q12; i expected P14.  (Dumb of me; if i were black, i would play Q12 then P13, because a stronger player drummed "forcing moves first" into my head.)

wms: Q13 looks fine to me.  I'm not sure that it is best, but I don't think that it is a disaster.]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[og]C[R17 is huge at this point.  Both players should try to get sente to play there.

===

For you, this must be like watching a pair of blindfolded, novice boxers...  ;)   At least, that's how _i_ feel when i watch a couple of 30k playing...]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[mh];B[oj];W[pk];B[kg];W[mg]C[w should have taken the ko.  Even if b makes a good ko threat, w simply gives up then and plays N13 with nothing lost and one less ko threat for B when the next ko starts.

===

An interesting general principle, which explains some of the baffling ko battles i've seen in 10k to 1d games...  The go teaching ladder is a Good Thing.  :)]

[C12 looks good.  W's marked stones could still live though (maybe), so somebody should play near them.

===

This was my idea of an invasion, and i thought i would link the C5 stones underneath.  I didn't want to play closer to them because i thought that would provoke a fight that would strengthen black and hem me in.

wms: It really won't be easy to connect out with the c5 stones.  Any moves above D8 will make b play closer to the edge and cut off c5 and E5, and they are too far away to connect out on their own.  You have to either make life where they are and accept the wall that develops or try to pinch D8 and F8.  But the pinch is ridiculous at this point because of b's strength to the right.]
;B[fc];W[kd]LB[li:A]C[L16 should have been ignored by b.  It is really pretty meaningless.

"A" would have been a better move if w wants to harass this group, because it also gives w a way to get into the center area.

===

Yes, immediately after i played L16, i wished i could take it back.  :)   But that would have been discourteous.

 After black's F17, the 3 white stones near H16 don't seem to have eye space.  Are they doomed at this point?

wms: They are not completely doomed, but it would probably be better to sacrifice them than to save them.  Maybe they could connect to C12, but it would be so costly that better would be to threaten to connect to them and thus get more space for C12 alone.]
;B[kc];W[kf]C[===

This was not useful.  I think i should have just played at M16... or should i have just ignored that L16 is in atari?

wms: M16 is pretty small.  It would have been better to ignore the whole area, play C15 or something.]

;B[de];W[df];B[ff]C[===

This seems to decisively kill the 3 stones near H16.  Would it have been better to play C15 at C14?  I then assume black D14, white D13, and it seems like white might have had more ways to try and save the H16 stones.  But, white's left-side group would have had less certainty of making 2 eyes, i think.  Is this the wrong approach to this stage of the game?

wms: H16 are dead all right.  Any attempt to save them will just make the loss bigger.  I would probably play D13, C9, or something like that.  I think that C15 *was* the right move.]
;W[gg];B[fg];W[gi];B[ei];W[eh];B[fh];W[fi];B[dh];W[eg]C[w should have just given up E12 for dead and played D13.

If I have general advice for w, it is to learn which stones to take care of and which to just give up.  For example, w has now twice wasted moves trying to save stones that are either hopeless or very small, whice C5 and E5, which could be very valuable, are ignored!

===

Yes, i completely misread this.];B[dg];W[ef];B[cf];W[cg];B[ee];W[cj];B[gh]

;W[kj];B[li]C[Now we see why w playing M11 would have been so helpful!  w desperately needs a way to pull stones out of the center, but b's wall has no gaps in it.]
;W[lj];B[mi];W[cl]C[===

Would this have been better at C7?

wms: Probably not.  I like C8 in this case.];B[cm];W[ck]C[I would maybe have played C9 at B8.]
;B[dn];W[bm];B[cn];W[bn];B[do]C[Good for w to link these up.];W[cp];B[dp]
;W[fj];B[gk];W[ej];B[dj];W[dk];B[di];W[el];B[em];W[ek]C[Again w should have fought the ko at least once.

===

But, what if instead of w E9, i played w D7, taking the ko... then b E9 ?  If w F9, it is a snapback, and b E9 again will capture 4 stones.  Should i really have fought the ko?

Ha!  True!  I hadn't seen the snapback.  You are correct, E9 was the right move.]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[cq];W[bf];B[df];W[bj]C[===

I suppose this would have been better at B15, right?  I was worried about b B12 atari, w B13, b B10 atari, w A12 capture, b B9.  (Now i see that the group i was worried about has a liberty at G9.  Oops.)

wms: Yes, B15 would be the better move.];B[be];W[ae];B[bg];W[bh]LB[bd:A]
C[I think w should have taken at "A" instead of defending.  If w had done this, both groups could have lived and b would have lost the corner.

===

For some reason, i don't see the mark "A".  I presume it would be at B16...  This had not occurred to me (even when i reviewed the game); again, i am thankful for your comments!  The go teaching ladder is a Good Thing!

wms: Yes, my "A" is at B16.];B[af];W[fm];B[gm];W[dm];B[fn];W[ms];B[ls];W

[nn];B[mn];W[sm]C[T7 was absolutely valualess.  Zero points in gote.

Endgame moves that I see are marked.

===

I had a wrong idea about playing at T4, then b T5 causing a double atari.  (Duh... black T5 would put a large black group in atari.  And those are dame, anyway, right?  Oh well.)  Unfortunately, i can't see the marks.  Maybe there is a newer ver of WinMGT that conforms to the newest .sgf standard.

wms: Unfortunately, stupid winMGT not only didn't show you the marks, but stripped them out of the SGF file so I can't see them either.  :-(  Oh well.]
;B[sq];W[sr];B[sp];W[rr];B[ah];W[ai];B[si];W[sj];B[sh];W[rj]C[===

S10 is not necessary, is it?

wms: No, it is not.];B[ad]C[Not sure why b played A16.  It looks like it is worth *negative* one point in gote.

===

I think he played A16 because he wanted to fill the ko at A13, but he couldn't, because that would put his 4 stones in atari.  At the time, it seemed reasonable to me; i suppose this reflects my lack of knowledge about how to proceed in the endgame.

wms: He should have played B14 instead.  It makes the ko of w A13 smaller.]
;W[ag];B[bf];W[fk];B[hl];W[dl];B[ah];W[so];B[mo];W[ag]C[w shouldn't bother fighting this ko.  Twin endgame kos, like A12 and M14, are a zero-sum game so they become miai.  Better to play O12, which is worth a point.
