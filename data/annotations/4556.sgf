C[D:  Reviewer, thank you so much for taking a look at my game.  I played black and thought I had a good fuseki.  Much of the middle game was consumed in running fights, and I believe I lost any advantage I might have had there.  Could you focus on opportunities I missed in the midst of the middle game?  Thank you!

Hi,
I enjoyed your game very much. In fact it is difficult for me to review your game, because our styles are very similar. I will point out some slight slips and I hope that they are usefull for you. I prefix my comments with g4. And be sure to use an SGF editor which shows variations. And I hope you will enjoy the review.

Peter];B[pp]C[D:  Errm.  I'm not sure why I didn't play in the correct corner.  Anyway.  First mistake.]

(;W[qf]LB[od:B][of:A]C[g4: Black is lucky here. I had tried P14 or P16.]
;B[pf];W[qe]C[g4: Excellent result for black];B[nd];W[pb]LB[gc:A]
C[g4: Small. Better to play G17];B[ob];W[qb];B[fd]C[g4: Good!]
;W[ce];B[dd]LB[cf:A]C[g4: You could also consider C14, which gives also a reasonable result. But this is a matter of taste.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[cc];B[df];W[cg];B[jc]C[D:  I've given white a lot of solid territory, so while I hate to play K17 instead of approaching D4, I feel like I should.  Do you have any thoughts on this?

g4: Very good! In Fact there is not so much territory for white. It's about a liitle more than 10 points on the upper left and right. The influence is much more worth.]
;W[ic];B[jd]C[g4: Good!];W[gc];B[eb];W[he]C[g4: Nice manouver by white. But nonetheless this group is weak and a target for attack.]

(;B[hd]SQ[ef][ff][gg][hg][ig][jh][kh][lh][mi][ni][oi][pj]C[D:  I wanted to squeeze the white stones a little, but I think now that I should have pressed from above to get my E17 stones out.  Where would you have played?  Or how would you have avoided this situation?

g4: The squeeze is possible here. But white manages to get out in spite of this. If you draw a line which is surrounding your moyo, you can see that white has invaded too deeply. So it seems a good alternative to attack from above. I would have done so. At last Your E17 stones are stronger than the 3 lonely white stones. Therefore you should not fear a fight.]
;W[gd]
(;B[id]C[g4: You should have squeezed now. The technique you used is sometimes called the toothpaste technique. In most cases it is not good to press the opponent thru a small hole into the open.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[if];B[ib]LB[dg:A][fh:B]C[g4: Too slow. Too small. Better to play D13 or F12]
;W[oc]
(;B[nc]C[g4: This is the right direction in play. You can afford to give up some useless stones. But you end in gote. You could consider to play P16. And in fact you are so strong here that you can fight back with the greatest resistance.]
;W[od]
(;B[nb]LB[ne:A]C[g4: I don't agree. The P18 stone is useless. The cuts around P15 are annoying. You should play there.]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[dg];B[eg];W[ee];B[ed];W[ge];B[ef];W[jg]LB[dh:B]
[ei:A]C[D:  Since I have G18, I feel like I can build on the bottom for a bit before pushing on white again.  Does this make sense?

g4: It does always make sense to play elsewhere if you don't see a good way to attack. 
But as your E17 group is not so strong anymore you could consider to some pressing move against the left side.]

(;B[qq];W[ql];B[jq];W[dj];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn]C[D:  At this point, I'm pretty happy.  The left side doesn't seem too tightly locked, since I can attack the J14 stones to build up for an attack on the side later.

D:  I considered an attack on the bottom right first to get a bit more center influence before attacking J14 but decided I really wanted some stones on the left side.  Was this a mistake? How would you have attacked the bottom right stones?

g4: The situation is not so easy here. There are 3 weak groups on the board. It is your E17 group now which has been weakened because of the white influence on the left. And there are the white center group and the white right side group. At last there is the possibility of a cut at P14/O15 which threatens your Q12 group. So you have to consider carefully the relations of these groups. White has always the option of playing G18 to cut your G17 group off. I would perhaps expand the bottom moyo to give the E17 group distant support.]

(;B[hh]C[g4: Also good!];W[hg]
(;B[gg]C[g4 G12 is simpler and coonects for sure.];W[gf]C[g4: This is only half an eye in gote. Much too slow.]
;B[ih]C[g4: This leaves the cutting point at G12. You just should connect there.]
;W[ig]LB[kf:A]C[g4: Better L14]
(;B[fi]LB[jh:A]C[g4: Good idea. But it seems better to continue pressing white]
;W[jh];B[ji];W[ki];B[jj];W[kj];B[jk];W[lg];B[nf]C[g4: The solid connection leaves no peeps behind. Locally play at O15.
But L9 seems most valuable. It influences the whole board and gives support to the Q13  group in the case white cuts there.]
;W[kk]
(;B[dl]C[g4: This is the right invasion point locally. But if you let white connect his groups you have no target for attack. This is your greatest advantage now.]
;W[ek];B[em];W[en];B[fm];W[fn];B[bl]C[g4: Endgame move. White can't connect here.]
;W[jl];B[hj];W[ik]
(;B[gh]C[g4: Unnecessary. You can afford to give this stone. This is only a good move if you plan to kill white's center group. White has some cutting points and his corner is weak now as you can invade at C3. I would like to keep the white groups separated.]

[ms][ns][os][ps]C[g4: Now the fight has come to an end. You should count now. Even if this costs one minute. :-)

One way of counting is to count only sure points.

White ca. 40 sure points (The 10 points in the bottom left are an average.
Black ca. 50 sure points. 

Without komi you should have an easy win.];B[rq]C[g4: I think C3 is bigger.]

(;B[rm]LB[ll:C][pm:B][ln:A]C[g4: This maybe gote. You should always try to play sente moves in the endgame first.
A5 seems to be one.
And you help white to connect S4.
There are 3 white groups which are not yet alive. It is the big one in the center, the one on the right side, and the three stones at the bottom. Before allowing white to connect all these you should try to get the most out of these. I add some possibilities.]
;W[qm];B[rn]C[g4: This is wrong. It makes your move at S3 look very silly.]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[qp];B[rl]C[g4: T4 is bigger as white T3 is sente.]
;W[qk];B[rk]C[D:  At the time, I thought that the wall I was giving white wasn't useful because of my N4 and O4 stones.

g4: That seems to be ok.];W[pj];B[qi]LB[ln:A]C[g4: Too small. You get nearly no territory with this move. 
You should play M6 first];W[sq];B[sr];W[me];B[ne]C[g4: Did you think about T4 now?]
;W[po];B[op];W[mn]
(;B[lo]LB[nn:A]C[D:  This was a hallucination.  I wanted to get into the center, but I misread it.

g4: This not a bad start. But you must be prepared to sacrifice this one. Perhaps you should have started with O6. It is possible that the stone at M5 is better placed at M6.]

(;B[mo]LB[nn:A]C[g4: This not the way into the center. Sacrifice this to get there.]

;W[pk]C[g4: Thanks];B[mh]LB[ba:B][ao:A][sp:C]C[D:  This seems tiny now.

(;B[oh]LB[mj:A]C[D:  Another misread.  I should have protected the F4 stones, but I thought white could cut off the O10 stones, too.

(;B[bm]C[g4: Why? For one point in gote? Consider A4 instead.]

[ss]C[D:  There you have it.  1.5 points off!  I'm sure my bad endgame doomed me, but I feel like I didn't play the middle game well.  Thanks for taking a look!

g4: 1.5 points is far beyond my calculation capability. You played a good game. 
There were some slight slips in the endgame. There you both have to concentrate on sente moves.
The main reason was to let white connect his weak groups too easyly. As you have sente moves which reduce the potential of your opponent or you gain some territory you should do these moves first.

Good luck
