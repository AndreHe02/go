sylvainc [11k\]: hi];B[pp]C[Despite the ponctual questions, did i missed big points or big sente plays in the game

I feel I had sente many times and kept a good pressure over White stones, but the result was not so big (24,5 pts) and White made a few mistakes. So without those mistake I wouldn't  won , but i dont know which mistakes i made (except in my questions)

Hello, I'm Araldo, 3 kyu. Hope this review will be useful to you. If you have any question, don't hesitate to send me an email.]
;W[dp]C[sylvainc [11k\]: have good game];B[pd];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq]
;B[pn];W[jp];B[jd];W[dj];B[fc]C[QUESTION :
is it better than invasion (D6 ou C6 ?) ?

A: Yes, I believe it is better than the invasion. After an invasion, you give the initiative to white. He will chase the invasion stones and make territory or a framework in the process.

The normal idea for black is to try to make a moyo, which is bigger that white's moyo (normally to compensate for komi). Therefore, it is desirable to play on tengen before white can do (see variation).

However, no time to play tengen in this game because white takes sente in the next moves by not finishing a joseki...]

(;W[ec];B[fd];W[mc]SQ[fc][fd][jd]TR[df]C[A: Did you notice white didn't finish the joseki at D14? It maybe a good idea to take advantage of that first, to strengthen the marked black stones. Several variations are given.]

(;B[oc];W[me];B[pf]C[A: Q14 is good. Only one weak black group left.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[ie];W[gd];B[he]C[QUESTION : ANSWER FROM White N17 TO BLack H15 : is it the good secquence ?

A: As I have said before, it would be better to punish the joseki mistake by white before attacking N17 (by building a wall). If you play P17+Q14 after that, you do not have weak groups at all and you will be able to chase N17 all over the board.

Apart from this, chasing the eyeless N17 to the centre, like you did, seems like a good idea. Alternative approach is to seal white in and let him live small on the top edge (see variation after N17).

The sequence after the H17 invasion seems reasonable.];W[gc]
;B[ld];W[md];B[kf];W[lf]C[A: risky move by white.];B[lg];W[kg]
C[A: M13 seems more vulnerable (see var.)]
(;B[jf];W[mg];B[lh];W[mh];B[li];W[mi]
(;B[nf]C[A: Peep is too early. Maybe you want to play M15 later on, so better save it for later. For now just keep extending.]
;W[lj]C[A: Mistake by white to ignore the peep. You can kill the upper part of whites group now.]
;B[mf];W[le];B[jh];W[kd];B[kc];W[ke];B[je];W[lc];B[mj]C[IS it better to cut here to attack the three stones , or O18 to attack the other White group ?

A: This is also a good move, but not as good as O18. O18 kills the white group, worth about 30 points (plus, your centre group is safe), which is definitely more than the value of N10]

(;W[nb]C[A: Mistake by white. You can kill his group now.]
(;B[ob]C[A: Mistake by black. Allows white to make his second eye.]
;W[lb];B[ib];W[ge];B[gf];W[kj];B[ji];W[nj];B[mk];W[og]
(;B[ng]C[is it better than P14 ?
Or O11 ?

A: O13 is probably the worst. It gives white the time to connect at O11, but is prety much useless for black. Q13 or P14 is nessecary to prevent white from capturing the three stones after that.

After O11, it is possible to sacrifice some stones, to secure territory and seal white in (see variation). Gives a reasonable result for black.

The simplest solution, P14,  is probably the best. White has to fight his way out. If you can prevent him from connecting to O3 or K4 and are able to save Q10, than it will be very difficult for white to get two eyes.]
;W[ni];B[pg];W[nk];B[ml];W[nl]
(;B[kl]C[Seems no good because White N7 make me an empty triangle with Black M8. So what is better ?

A: Extending is best. When you have enough liberties, you can jump or hane.

L8 is not that bad. However, M8 is. L9 instead makes a better shape.]
;W[mm]
(;B[ll];W[pl];B[nm]C[A: Seems you want to kill white. This more or less requires that you safe the Q10 stone...]

;B[re];W[rn];B[rm];W[rl];B[qm];W[jk];B[ln];W[hk];B[fe]C[is it big enough, or better play eslwhere ?

A: This is quite a large move. However, more important: it is an urgent move, because it secures eyespace for your group. Besides, there is now the follow up at C17.

C3 is also large but less urgent.];W[df]
(;B[fp]C[is it the right place for invasion. I just wanted to reduce White s moyo

A: You have to be sure the invasion stones can survive. Either live on their own or connect to L8 etc.

The F4 invasion might be captured, I'm not entirely sure.

Therefore I would have chosen C3, which is well known and often played with the D10 and K4 stones in place. As it ends in sente for black, you can directly start to reduce his moyo after that.]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[eq];B[fo];W[hq];B[ho];W[jn]C[A: You are in big trouble now. Two solutions: attack the white stones, or make a few eyes.]

A: K19 is not very large. And it is gote.];B[ms];W[fa];B[om]
;W[qp];B[rq]C[is it right answer ? White did not continue  but White R5 could be played

A: S3 is fine. I think there isn't much white can do now. However he can gain a point by playing P4, which you probably have to answer.

---

Overall, you played very well I think. Your timing was quite good. You missed a few opportunities, but that is what happens to everybody in a timed game. Your yose was not too bad either.

Only the F4 invasion was a bit too risky. Nowhere to run and not much space to create eyes. If white had taken care of the centre stones better, you would not have won so easily.
