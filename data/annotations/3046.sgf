C[In this game I had a very good start after my opponent made some dubious moves but then completely failed to control it and in the end almost lost. I' d like to ask some advise about how to better stay in the driver's seat

ug: Hi Jochen,

I reviewed your game. My comments are preceded by "ug". I hope they are of some use for you.

As you will see, the main mistake you made was neglecting you weak group in the center. I sometimes tend to play in a similar way myself, so I know that it is hard to stick to the right attitude. But it is really an extremely important principle to strengthen one's weak groups in time. Even if the opponent cannot kill, the profit from attacking may decide the game (it almost did, in your game).

Best regards,

Ulrich

(;W[qq]C[ug: I am not sure whether this is good. An alternative would be to start surrounding some territory in the center, and at the same time strengthening the H14 group. The problem with R3 is that the black wall facing the left which results from this invasion hurts white's potential in the center.]

ug: White probably had better ko threats than P16 (for example C5 or O5, but I think that White can nevertheless be satisfied with his position. It should be an easy win for white.]

(;W[bj]CR[ig]C[this surely was a bad move, but simply pulling out the marked stone seemed too passive

ug: Indeed, this is a pure endgame move. It is much more important to settle the H14 group. The only hope for black to win this game is by killing some white group, and the only group which may have a (small) chance of being killed is the H14 group. If white saves it, he cannot lose.]

ug: I agree. However, it is equally important to notice that although white lives, black got a lot of profit from this attack. Black captured the K8 stones and the G10 stones, and white gets a lot less points in the center than he could have got.]

Let's try to (roughly) count the game:

Black: left side: 26, lower right: 10, upper right + upper side: 40 (or less), captures: 2
total: 78

White: bottom + center: 50 (or more), lower right: 6, upper right: 10, upper left: 12, captures: 6, komi: 6.5
total: 90.5]))
(;W[nh]C[ug: This also looks good. It threatens R12 and/or Q14, and puts more pressure on the black N10 stones.]
))
(;W[ej]C[ug: It is not so easy for black to do anything against a huge white moyo in the center. Since white has P10 already in place, black cannot aim for a huge territory himself. White has several options to reduce anything black could build.]
))
(;B[go]C[ug: This looks much better for B than the game (and shows that maybe L5 was an overplay - L4 would have been more solid, and good enough for white).]
