C[hello, I am azahar1, do not seem to get any better...
thanks for taking care of me!

Hi azahar1.  There are many paths to getting better.  When I was your level, I felt studying a bit helped me get better the fastest.  Find a book on go that suits your needs and read it and think hard about the examples.  You should get better quite quickly, initially, that way.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qm]SQ[pn][qn][po][qo]C[This move is probably not technically "wrong" but usually you would like to create an enclosure at one of the square points; Q5,Q6,R5 or R6.  I believe that playing at R7 leaves the possibility of R5 too open, later in the game, with no good way to defend against it.]
;W[nc];B[oc]C[P17 is not generally considered a good response in this case.  It is inviting White to O16 and then black will want to play at Q14 or R14 to keep the corner and side from being attacked.  This gives white an ideal extension.  See alternate path to see how this may have turned out.

Instead, I may have played O16 to attempt to gain some of the top side.]
;W[nd]C[It is not the proper time to approach in this situation.  Your upper-right corner is not very secure and the black stone does not attack white's O17 group.  White has a beautiful follow up to your move at K17.  Your lone black stone will be unable to make a base and will either have to run or slide into the corner.]
(;B[fc]C[It is not the proper time to approach in this situation.  Your upper-right corner is not very secure and the black stone does not attack white's O17 group.  White has a beautiful follow up to your move at K17.  Your lone black stone will be unable to make a base and will either have to run or slide into the corner.]
;W[fd]C[The wedge at E16 seems like the most favorable move at this point because black has the ladder.]
;B[ec]C[This move is generally not good.  I think you will improve much if you study your josekis.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[cb];B[ea];W[ed];B[gc];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb]C[B ends up cramped...White has a secure corner and a live group at N17 and there is still bad Aji for black if white plays around Q14.  Black traded this all for about 7 points.]
;B[hd]C[Getting a group out is usually good but there are many huge points left in the game now.  A move on the left side or around R14 would be worth far more than the move you made.]
;W[dh]C[White helps guarantee that a large portion of the left side will be his, although I would've prefered playing on the third line as fourth line territory is usually invadeable.]
;B[jp];W[hq];B[jd]C[This move serves to strengthen white's group.  Whenever you play a move, it is important to think how they will respond and if the situation will be more or less favorable for you than before.]
;W[kd];B[ic];W[je];B[id];W[ie]C[This move does little to gain any points and is not worth that much.  Also, white leaves a weakness at L17 that is difficult to read out how it will play out.]
;B[ge]C[black is too determined to not let this group get shut in.  You are basically wasting moves.  Other moves on the board, such as R14 look far bigger.]
;W[ke]C[This stone is too high, black's right side is very easily invadeable, still.]
;B[of]C[This move is not very big and does not accomplish much in the grand scheme of the game..]
;W[mf];B[pi];W[np]C[Wrong invasion point.  White probably did not think about his follow up move after black moved.  M3 or N3 would have been much better.]
;B[mq]C[The white stone is just floating at this point.  It is difficult to say what the best move is.  I probably would play O3 to split his groups.]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[mp];B[nq]C[At this point white should just jump out far at a point like N8 or O8.  White can then ensure he can connect his group to the top group.]
;W[lq]C[White's intention seems to be to attack the K4 stone.  However, white should be looking out for his own groups before he attacks something else.]
;B[lp];W[kq];B[jq];W[jr];B[kp];W[kr];B[iq];W[ir];B[op];W[oo]
;B[oq];W[nm];B[mn];W[nn];B[mo];W[no]C[White should consider how many points a move at O5 by black is worth.  The answer is four points.  I can see dozens of points on the board worth more than that right now.]
;B[mm];W[nk];B[pk];W[mk]C[Black should consider trying to create eyespace for his group at L4.  It will be difficult for black if white gets a chance to attack the group.]
;B[dn]C[Black gives white the opportunity.];W[cl]C[However, white passed it up to try to grab some of the left side.]
;B[ol];W[nl];B[hp];W[gq];B[fp]C[One space jump was a poor choice in this instance.  White can be cut.]
;W[gp];B[go];W[ho];B[ip];W[fo]C[White makes a huge mistake.  With F5, Black can respond with F6 and the L4 group will live.]
;B[fn]C[With F6 you were risking a ko for the life of your group.]
;W[eo];B[gn];W[en];B[em];W[dm];B[dl];W[cm];B[dk];W[ck];B[ep]
;W[do]C[After this there's some fighting that I have trouble commenting on without specific questions and then the end game.  I believe I could have been more helpful if you asked questions but I hope you have learned something nontheless.]
