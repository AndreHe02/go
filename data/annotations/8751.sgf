C[smonds3:  I won by a little, but was unsure of my play through most of the game. Some ideas on this game would be helpful.

Jon:  Hi!  I'm Jon, your reviewer, and have provided my thoughts on the larger points in the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[oq];B[cd];W[ec];B[ic];W[ch]LB[ec:A]C[smonds3:  I haven't encountered this. I am much more familiar with the one and two space pincers.

Jon:  Three is a bit unusual, but it's not drastically different.  I would also note that it puts less pressure on your top left corner stone, which means it won't be able to support a future activation of the E-17 (A) stone as much.]
;B[ed]LB[dc:B][ck:A][po:C]TR[ch]C[smonds3:  I guess i expected, White A, Black B, white C. But he didn't go along that way.

Jon:  That's a reasonable line to expect, but I would question whether it's necessary to make the defense at B, especially given that white made the more gentle double approach (marked).  I don't really want to spend the time to lock down the corner and allow white to continue expanding quickly.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[qm]C[smonds3:  White is playing very interesting, by all the tenuki. I decide to be patient and wait for the right time to exploit.

Jon:  I really like that mindset!  You have to be careful not to get pushed around too much, but otherwise it's a good plan.]
;B[po];W[fd]LB[pj:A][lq:B]C[smonds3:  This move I didn't expect.

Jon:  I'm surprised too, since it's pretty early in the game to be worrying about activating this stone.  I would look at extending along the right side (A) instead.  Extending along the bottom (B) is also a consideration.]
;B[ee];W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[dd];W[fb];B[fe]LB[bc:A][ic:B]C[smonds3:  Was playing at A better to keep him from making a base?

Jon:  It's tempting, but I really don't want to let him get the push at the same spot here (F-15).  It would also put more counterpressure on your J-17 stone (B).]
;W[bc];B[gd];W[pi];B[fc];W[eb]C[smonds3:  Feels like an even game?

Jon:  Basically.  I feel white's a bit ahead because of his better "spread" (distribution of his stones), but it should even out as the game progresses.]
;B[ck];W[cm];B[ek];W[ei];B[kq];W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[gl];W[hi]
;B[fj]LB[gh:A]C[Jon:  I'd prefer to omit this exchange, since you can peep more cleanly by playing A directly.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[gi];B[hl];W[ik];B[fq];W[dr]LB[dq:A]C[Jon:  This defense is very loose, especially with all the black stones nearby.  It leaves black with an opportunity to invade pretty easily, so I'd strongly recommend defending more tightly (A).]
;B[pq]C[smonds3:  At this point, I feel black is slightly ahead?

Jon:  Agreed.  You'll also be able to keep white distracted by threatening his bottom left corner group.]
;W[lp]LB[ko:A]TR[oq]C[Jon:  Trying to reduce with respect to the marked stone is somewhat narrow, so I'd prefer to cap instead (A).  It's easier to escape with, but also opens the possibility of poking into the left part of the bottom side.]
;B[kp];W[lo];B[il];W[jk];B[km]C[smonds3:  Better move?

Jon:  I'm pretty content with the current one.];W[ko];B[lq]
;W[np];B[jo];W[on];B[co]LB[og:B][pn:A]TR[on][ko][lo][lp][np]
[oq]C[smonds3:  Too soon?

Jon:  Perhaps a little, since I would also consider separating the marked group (A) and trying to expand the top center area (B) before starting this.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[cn]LB[eo:B][ep:A]C[Jon:  Connecting directly leaves the hole around A open, so I'd like to weaken that possibility for white by extending to B instead.]
;W[qc]C[smonds3:  Here I don't know if i handled it well.

Jon:  You handled it pretty reasonably.  Building the wall towards the right side requires more work to compensate for the loss of points on the top, but in return, you get to try destabilizing white's right side.]

;B[mc];W[fp];B[gp];W[eo];B[dm];W[go];B[hp];W[fr];B[eq];W[ep]
;B[gr];W[er];B[pn];W[pm];B[oo];W[lm];B[nn];W[mq]LB[kl:A]C[Jon:  I'm not really concerned about reinforcing this spot, so I'd rather hane at A and try to avoid getting shut in.]
;B[ll];W[kn]LB[mm:A]C[Jon:  This doesn't feel good at all for white.  Extending to A looks a bit better for trying to reach towards white's right side group.]
;B[mm];W[mn];B[om];W[nr]C[Jon:  You can definitely be happy about this result.  White is now stuck trying to defend, which buys you valuble time for going after his right side.]
;B[jn];W[pr];B[qr];W[qs];B[rr];W[lr];B[kr];W[ks];B[pk];W[qk]
;B[qj];W[pj];B[ql];W[pl];B[rk];W[ok];B[qk];W[ol];B[rm]TR[pi]
[pj][ok][ol][pl][pm][qm]C[Jon:  Now that the right side has been taken away, the game is looking pretty good for you, especially with white's marked group coming under attack next.

This is the last comment - please skip to move 189 for the conclusion.]

;W[ga];B[hb]LB[af:a][eh:b]C[smonds3:  Now I think black has enough. Also A is now sente allowing a cut at B. ( but i didn't see it until later.)

Thanks for comments!

Jon:  No problem, hope you enjoyed it!  If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know.]
