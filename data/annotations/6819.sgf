(;W[hc]TR[gb][fc]SQ[mc][jd][dj][pj]C[Kichiro: Both here and the variation you created are a little bit strange. The marked black stones are too strong to be attacked like this. You pose no threat. It's far better to create a little moyo. Potential area for expansion. Than to start attacking this early.]

(;W[ic];B[lc]
(;W[jb]C[Kichiro: This move doesn't do anything either. The variations below are better moves for attacking the black stone which is now very very weak. Also don't fear him connecting too much. If you do play L18 because it's a slightly more offensive move and builds more for you.]
;B[oc];W[pc];B[re]
(;W[pf];B[rg];W[rk]CR[pj][qm][pp]TR[nc][ke][me][dj][jp]C[Kichiro: Far too low to have any potential. Totally relying on the opponent to make mistakes that will make it viable. I hope I'm not sounding too harsh. But I get a feeling this was a I'll just play somewhere where I think I need to play, but not thinking about the actual placement of the stone.

Circles are better points in the area.. Triangles better plays in general.]

(;W[hq]TR[lh]C[QUESTION:

MAIN QUESTION: BASED ON OUR LEVELS OF SKILL AND THE GLIMPSES OF PLAY STYLE YOU CAN GARNER FROM THESE MOVES, WOULD WHITE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE AND SECURE THE MIDDLE AND UPPER RIGHT.

ALSO WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF SECURING A HOLD IN THE BOTTOM CENTER

Answer: The upper right yes. The middle yes. Depends on who is the first to see the urgency of a move there.  The triangle is an important move for both of you. I'll continue the note on the next move.]
;B[hp]C[Kichiro: I think there are some basic flaws in your game at the moment.

1. You go for the throat too much. Try not to lure the other person into fights with empty moves. Either make a really strong threat which has to be fought for. Or and this is way more important look for better moves on the board to improve your overall position.

2. You play too much without thinking. Maybe you play too fast, which I think you do. Not always, but sometimes. Like playing very low or attacking positions that are just too strong. This is of course linked with 1.

3. You're shapes aren't strong enough. You have a tendency to leave them alone for too long and think it will all work out. Which the upper right demonstrates perfectly is that it doesn't. Try to make sure your stones are secured.

If you can't become more patient try working on overall board situations and moves that automatically make sure you're shape is strong. Defence seems to be your greatest lack. 

Good news though. You don't fear taking risks. Which is invaluable it will help you learn. You show good insight in fights as well. 

If you can't seem to work with the board positions etc. Try to get the basics and make sure you become a lot stronger with the fighting. Since it seems that's your "thing". Maybe it's more enjoyable to you and things we enjoy always help us learn. 

I hope it was helpful. Good luck on the path to go mastery.]
