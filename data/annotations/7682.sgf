C[Hey there ;)

Here I have a game that I won "by accident" .
My opponnent (clearly 1-2k better than me), made a little mistake.
Therefore, I think it could help me if someone stronger than me could tell me what I did wrong :)

So far, Stefan];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[eq]
C[I didnt know excactly what to do after this move, so I tried F5.

yes, F5 is the only move I would say.];B[fo];W[ep];B[fr]SQ[go]
[gq]C[I think all those 3 marked moves are possible now, depending on what you want.]
;W[go]C[You should play h4 here instead of h5...]
(;B[ho];W[gn];B[hp];W[fn]C[well, you kept sente, but it's not as clear as in the shown variation. I think I would tenuki as W and play in the lower right corner.]
;B[po]C[Here I choosed the shimari to make a moyo.

looks fine.];W[dj];B[fc]C[Actually, I dont think this was the right move, it allows white to build up a large moyo ...

No, it's ok. I would prefer it to playing an invasion, that's too early. The upper side is empty, so it really looks fine to me. The only alternative for me would be to play around K16.]
;W[fd]
(;B[ec]C[I haven't seen this move before...];W[ed];B[gd];W[ge]
;B[hd];W[he]
(;B[ie]C[Somehow I played wrong here, giving him a strong wall that worked perfectly with D10 .
Could I have played otherwise ?

see variation, but the outcome is similar. 

the cut at J16 looks dangerous, I would take one move more on the fourth line.  Making territory on the 4th line is usually better for the one who gets it. In this case, where a large moyo begins to develop, I would still consider it as an even exchange.]

TR[bd][bp]C[Moyo reduction. But not effective as I wanted to :(

you can still try an invasion... maybe start on one of the marked points for creating aji, and dependig on whites answer peacefully take the corner or continue towards the center. It doesn't make much sense to show variations here, there are endless possibilities, but you should remember spots like these and just try.]
