C[I'm black.  I play an okay game, but my opponent makes two invasions in the endgame that I fail to kill, which turned the game around.

I should lock myself in a room for 6 months and study tsumego, but that would interfere with the rest of lifestyle.

Other than that, I'm just soliciting general comments.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide.

[Broege:\] All comments are marked with [Broege:\], just as this one.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq];W[dj];B[pj]LB[qj:A]C[So far everything seem normal to me, although if I were white I'd play W6 near 'A'.  But I guess making a sanrensei as white is big here, too.

[Broege:\]
A is a very common move for White, but the move played is also good. Personally, I think that the choice is more a matter of playing style than anything else.]

[be:C][lp:D][pm:E][cg:F][dg:G][hd:H]C[This is probably messed up.  I haven't had enough practice with it.  'A' might be more reasonable, or make it a large moyo game with B.  The submarine play at C is possible.

But white can't really win easily in a race for grabbing territory.   Maybe I just continue for D.  My judgement fails here.  Help!

[Broege:\] If you want to secure territory E would probably be better - taking most of the right side. As for reducing or invading White influence I would recommend H or G for reducing or F for invading - the last one only if you feel adventurous.

If White chose to attack Black here (i.e. by playing at A or a point above) most probably Black would live small in the corner while White would get a strong wall.]
;W[cc];B[de]LB[ce:A][cg:B]C['A' might be more peaceful here.

[Broege:\] Might be, but after White B it may be hard to escape or make eyes. The fight seems to be better - this is what C16 was aiming at.]

;W[ko]LB[ln:A][ll:B]C[[Broege:\] I think that White could still have a hard time after peeps at A and B. See the sample variations (not that they are correct but they show some possibilites for attacking).]

C[I'm not sure if connecting here is best, but it's simple.

[Broege:\] Black can always connect later at A so it's not necessary to do this now.]
;W[hj]LB[hk:A][ij:B]C[Pay close attention the following series of moves.  To some extent they may be aji-keshi, because black doesn't gain to much from them, and if there were any possibilities of seriously harassing the central white group, these moves remove that possibilty.  Or maybe not.  That's why I'm getting this reviewed!

[Broege:\] Please see the variations at move 69. Now it is too late to do anything serious to the white group - it is connected (either via A or B) to the left size.]
