----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It isn't necessarily too high although this joseki is aimed for influence rather than territory, and white gets to enclose the corner on sente but Black gets a solid position towards the center]

(;B[nd]TR[kc]C[Proper move? O17 better? I was trying to prevent an eventual cut like in the variation from move 17.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would even play N17 and put pressure on the L17 stone. If W pushes on Q15 and threatens to cut, it creates bad aji on the cut at R13. It still playable for both but isn't necessarily bad for B. (see variation)

Cutting sometimes aren't necessarily a big weakness in the joseki/fuseki stage of the game]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

is not a bad idea, although I would play at C18 first becouse is senteand then H16 ( see variation)]

;B[de]C[this is a good move, it both threatens to cut W and at the same time conects B. A move that serves 2 purposes at the same time is a usually a good move, Well done.]
;W[ce];B[df]LB[ff:A][gf:B][gh:C]C[This move is very slow and heavy, I would consider A, B or even C to settle B. Tennuki is also an option]
;W[on]LB[jf:C][bj:B][ej:D][dn:A]TR[ck][dk][cn][bp]C[Slow move?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not nearly slow as the last move, but it is still slow. There are other priorities, such as attacking the lower left group with moves such as A and B, or to attack B at the top with moves such as C or D.

My option would be D, I feel that is the vital point.];B[iq]
