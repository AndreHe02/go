C[
Dear reviewer, I took white in this game. My main query is in the opening to middle game. I think I've effectively lost the game during the middle game, although my opponent gave me a chance to kill the big group in the centre.
Thanks for reviewing the game.

Quest : Is w G7 a good move? Or are there more urgent points?

G7 is pretty good. In this moment, No  urgentpoints.];B[fr]
C[
Quest : I was very tempted to press at F3 here. Is it advisable? Locally, where would you play?

F3 is'nt such important. Because left down corner is already alive. N3 makes white stronger and safety.]

Quest : Here, I'm concerned about direction. Is this direction correct? Or are there better moves?

Direction is correct.];B[pg]

Did you know another variation ?
P13 isn't popular in my knowledge.];B[qc];W[qe];B[pc];W[qg]
C[
Quest : I thought quite long and hard about W R13. Was it necessary? I think W has lost out in this exchange at the top right. Essentially B is playing in W's region and managed settle easily and with sente as well, am I right? But how else should I have approach this?

R13 is necessary and part of JYOUSEKI(standard variation). I agree with your opinion. Right upper corner would be huge and empty place. so, White can't keep advantage in this region.]
;B[nq];W[qn];B[pn];W[qm]C[
Quest : I thought about W R7 too? Was it too timid?

Q7 would be bad move. This R7 move  is not so bad.];B[cc]C[
Quest : Another big play by B. Again I see my potential territory being eroded bit by bit.

Don't be pessimistic.];W[cd];B[bd]
(;W[dc]C[
Aqura: Do you know another variation ? In this case ,your variation is better than this.]
;B[bb];W[cb];B[bc];W[cl]C[
Quest : I invaded C18 at this point because I think W's territory is not enough. What do you think? And is there a better invasion point?

Whatever W's territory is, This is about time to invade.
How about C10,D9,R3?];B[cj];W[el]C[
Quest : Are there any better moves than running with E8?

No move is better than E8.];B[dm];W[dl];B[fn];W[gl];B[gj];W[en]
;B[fm]C[
This move ruin to cheat whites. This move should be F8.];W[em]
;B[fl];W[fk];B[gk]C[
This move should cut counter side of
DANTEN.];W[fo]C[

This move makes things complicate.
I would like to recommend R3. check another variation.];B[pp]
;W[on];B[id]C[
Quest : Would var 2 be better?

I guess so.]

Aqura : Why didn't choose O14?
This N8 is pretty good. But, I don't think to rush. because Black can't fix own weakness so easily.]

Aqura :  ?  This move must be M15, whatever .];B[le];W[kf];B[lf]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[if]C[
Quest : I made a mistake here. I should have played J15 instead, right?

These whites group is already hard to run(esacape). White should have make stronger more earlier.]

Quest : I think B H9 is bad shape. It has made the whole group killable. What do you think?

I had no confidence to kill. These stones looks very dangerous.]
