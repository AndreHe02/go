C[Hi there !
My comments will be noted with [CB\]. I'm cb22 on many Go sites (KGS and others)

As this is my first review, maybe some points won't be crystal clear to you, if so, please come see me on KGS (cb22) I'll be glad to help/answer you're questions :) (and I will progress in commenting game)

If some of my comments needs explanation you can send me an email too, I will answer you as quick as possible

As none of you asked for specific situations, I will try to do my best. 

Don't take every thing I say as gold statement as I'm not a professionnal nor a good player :)

Hope you will enjoy!]FG[259:]PM[2];B[dp];W[pp];B[dd];W[pd]C[[CB\] : ok so far, this game starts like a moyo game as both of you played on star points. In my opinion, influence style is more difficult than territory style when you're a double digit kyu. But who cares :D]
;B[nq];W[qm]C[[CB\] : this joseki leaves a weakness in white's corner but is not necessarily a bad choice]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[kq]
(;W[cn]C[[CB\] IMO, white K16 or F17 could be better here, because you want to develop you're moyo. Diving right now into black area may be a bit early]
(;B[fq]C[[CB\] Pincer here should be a good option for black. As black already made some territory on the bottom side, there's not much more to develop. Maybe you should try to make a large pincer and use you're D16 stone to create a moyo.]
(;W[dk]C[[CB\] I don't know this move. It feels strange as white is not settling his position, leaves big weakness for black to exploit. Playing the classical joseki or C9 would be better]
;B[ci]C[[CB\] black is trying to attack white by forcing him to settle, but it's not the biggest point on the board I think => O17 should be better.]
(;W[cf]C[[CB\] One more weak group for white. This is going to be a hard time for him.]
(;B[ei]C[[CB\] Ok for black, white is now separate]
(;W[dh]C[[CB\] playing this kikashi is not really helping you. You should leave the situation like this and keep it for later (for defending D9 for example)]
;B[di];W[cd];B[de];W[cc]
(;B[co]CR[dd][de]TR[dk][cn]C[[CB\] Why are you leaving you're two stones like this ? Fight is not over in the upper corner!

White group is going to be hard to kill, white got a stone on the fourth line and can escape easily in the center (plus you're corner can be reduce/invade in exchange).

When attacking don't touch your opponent stones as you will reinforce him most of the time. B4 is better for black, it secures a big corner and threats "white's base"]
;W[dn]
(;B[gn]C[[CB\] good idea, threatening white and building the south side ! BUT it's not urgent ! 

I'm not good enough to show "the solution" but white could get a lot by attacking the two black's weak group so you should stabilize you're two weak stones up there]
(;W[bj]C[[CB\] to much aji left !];B[no]LB[nc:B][gd:A][qf:C]
[eh:D]C[[CB\] Maybe a bit slow, there's is still you're two stones up there to settle (A) and a corner to approach (B or C, but I prefer B). D could help black enclose white but I don't feel the need to build a wall as black don't have a stone around K16]

[ns][os]C[[CB\] white turns. Let's take a point at the game here :

White : two weak groups (specially the A group) so let assume you have 6 points in upper left corner. 9 points in bottom right corner. I assume 10 points for the upper right star point. 6.5 komi => 31.5 + sente + weak group

There's no influence for upcoming territory

Black : bottom side : 26 points of territory and 30 points of "maybe" territory (I'll take half of this point) =>41

White as to do something to come back in the game !
Black should keep a slow pace and play to keep is big advantage !]
;B[dc]C[[CB\] nice as it threatens white corner];W[df]C[[CB\] : black looks in trouble... but he can connect is two weak groups or take the corner]
(;B[hc]C[[CB\] sacrifice the corner could be a good idea as black has the advantage in points but here it will cost to much. Black should get the corner or connect his weaks group. I put you some long variations. Do not hesitate other ways !]
;W[fb];B[fe];W[db];B[fc];W[ec];B[gd];W[gc];B[ed];W[fc]
(;B[he]LB[id:C][ef:A][gf:B]C[[CB\] the result is not good for black => no eye and a lot of forcing move for white : very ugly shape]
;W[mc]
(;B[qh]C[[CB\] To far and to close !];W[qj]C[[CB\] good direction]
;B[re];W[rd];B[qd]
(;W[qc];B[qe];W[rc];B[pe];W[od];B[oh];W[oe];B[bl]C[[CB\] nice]
;W[bm]
(;B[bi]C[[CB\] could have been a won game for black here... playing on the second line here is really small]
;W[cj];B[ce];W[be];B[ee];W[bf]C[[CB\] wasted move for white, nothing to be worry of]
;B[pn]C[[CB\] nice move by black. Here you know why R7 was not an optimal play for white]

Remember to look after you're weak group before creating new one in the opening. Trying to create confusion can be helpful but not in the early stages.

Some moves were great (if read from the start ;-)) but somes were awful. But hey, it's why we're all playing, progress and improve our reading and fighting abilities. Continue like this !

White put himself in danger early and turns the tables later on with black big mistake, so never surrender until you're really sure you can't come back !

Try to do some easy tsumegos to improve you're reading ability and always try to see 3 moves further before playing!

Hope this review will help you !])
