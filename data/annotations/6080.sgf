C[Hello,

Thank you for reviewing my game. I've left questions/comments throughout the game.

I look forward to reading your suggestions!

Thank you,

- Derek

Hi Derek,

My name is Riaan Swart (TrueOrgan on KGS) and I will try to review your game as best I can!  I hop you find it useful!

Riaan];B[dp];W[pd];B[ec];W[qp];B[dj]C[TO: I don't think this is too good for black..]
;W[oq];B[qf];W[ph];B[qd];W[qc];B[rc];W[rd];B[qe];W[rb];B[pc]

(;W[sc];B[od]
(;W[qa]C[TO: This move is not so good, you can achieve exactly the same thing and keep initiative with Q18.]
;B[jd];W[cd]C[TO: This is a good invasion I think, a black move there would be too good...]
;B[cc]
(;W[cg];B[ch];W[bc];B[dd];W[ce];B[nh]
(;W[rh]C[TO: What does this move do? You want to claim large piece of right side as your territory? I do not think this is appropriate.]
;B[rg]C[TO: If you do not add another stone in this sequence, S12 will have been for nothing, so I suggest you play R9.]

(;W[cn];B[cp];W[ck]C[TO: I see you like the two-space jump on the third line.. It is a useful base, but the group will probably live small, so you must use it wisely.]
;B[dg];W[bg];B[df];W[bi];B[fq];W[cq]C[TO: Major overplay... What did you want to do with this?]
;B[bq];W[bo];B[jq];W[pb]C[TO: Here you play that forcing move anyway, rendering R19 useless.]
;B[oc]
(;W[ma]C[TO: Monkey jump is a lot of points, but this is too early for that.]
;B[mb];W[nb];B[la];W[na];B[lb]
(;W[pl]LB[ql:A]C[Would A have been better?

TO: I think with the power of the shimari in the corner, you might even consider R9.]
;B[nl]C[TO: You must be careful of being blocked from the center as is happening here...]
;W[cb]C[I felt this move was small but Sente.

TO: Hmm not sente, black can gain a lot elsewhere, by plaing something like N3, which is a big point.]

(;B[dc]C[I'm ahead of Black in territory, but he has massive influence on the center. I decided I had to attack somehow, and I decided to pick a fight at the top.

Was this necessary? Or could I have approached it a different way?]

(;W[ee]C[TO: This is much too nice for black.  He is all too happy to connect with D15, while you are left with a weak stone.]
;B[de];W[fb];B[eb];W[gd]C[TO: These are severe overplays I think, you were very lucky to gain from them.]

;B[mf];W[mg];B[lh];W[lg];B[mh];W[hp];B[hq];W[gn]LB[lq:A]C[Would A have been better than that sequence?

TO: Yes, A is extremely large.  Not only gives you direct territory, but also makes you a lot less flat, resulting in more territory.]

(;W[hm]TR[hl][il]C[TO: Hmm, bad shape.  This empty triangle is inefficient.  Remember that saving the K7 stone is not so big.  Consider playing H6.]

Thank you again for your help!
