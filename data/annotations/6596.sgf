Dear reviewer,

First of all, thank you for reviewing this game. I played Black in this game and won it by time.

Please can you show me my mistakes and also the ones from my opponent ?

Thomas];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[od];B[cp];W[pf];B[qn]C[reid: Hello Thomas,

Let's start right here.  R6 is an interesting idea.

Usual of course is to attach at either A or B.  White ends up with a strong wall, but that's the price black pays for getting three corners.

With R6, black is saying he wants to let white take more profit in the upper right corner in exchange for black building a framework on the bottom edge.]
;W[re];B[ob]LB[dj:A]C[reid: In go, as in most aspects of life, it's important to pick which battles you want to fight.  How should you pick them?  It's not too hard:  you want to fight where you already have an advantage.  Early on, that means you want to fight where you have a simple numeric superiority of stones.  Kind of like entering a boxing ring - you would prefer to have a weight and height advantage over your opponent, right?

In the upper right, it's three white stones to 1 black.  After black plays, it's three white vs two black.  On average, white has a two-to one advantage, or a one ahd a half stone advantage.  Black cannot hope to get a 'good' result here against those kinds of odds.  And he doesn't really need to play here yet.  Better I think would be to play somewhere else where the fight is more in black's favor.  If white takes one more move to secure the upper right corner, then he deserves to have it: he's played three extra stones there.  So black can wait to see how things develop.

Playing P18 now is not very consistent with R6 - black seems to want everything.

I think black A instead of P18 would be a fast and interesting way to proceed.

Ming-Jiu: P18 is OK.];W[pc];B[pb];W[qc];B[lc];W[jc];B[le];W[je]
LB[mb:A][qb:B][rb:E][nc:D][rc:C][nd:F]C[reid: After this sequence, black has a problem at A which destroys black's eyespace.  White may not be able to take advantage of it right away, but black must be very careful how the rest of the game develops so that A doesn't become a lethal weakness.  That also means white should be able to count on getting a lot of the territory to the left of K17 and K15 (black can't afford to invade there because of his weakness at A).

Ming Jiu: Insteaad of M15, black should push into the corner with B.  If white resonds solidly with C, black also makes a solid shape with D.  If instead white hanes at E, then black takes a liberty with F to take advantage of the aji.]
;B[cf]C[reid: I would be reluctant to help white this way.  White should be able to harden his territory now.

If black doesn't play C14, then later he might be able to play directly at C17 or D17 to reduce the white structure.]
;W[fd]LB[cb:H][db:K][cc:B][dc:E][fc:D][cd:F][be:L][de:G][bf:J]
[df:I][ef:C][ch:A]C[reid:  Hmmm, I think it's more natural for white to pincer at A.  If black dives into the corner with B, then white encloses and makes K15 shine.  If black jumps out to C, then again K15 should work well.  Finally, if black makes a double approach at D, white ducks in to B and fights, and once again K15 will be very useful.

You must spend every effort to make the stones you already have down on the board work as hard as possible.

Ming Jiu: C14 is OK.  If white A, then black B and white E.  The joseki continues with black F through white K.  Now black has three corners, so he can be satisfied with this result.

Nowever, white F16 is too slow.  Instead, white should keep the corner with L (B15).]
;B[dj]C[reid: Black gets a fast development.  White is all concentrated on the upper edge.]
;W[fp]LB[mb:B][on:C][iq:A]C[reid: I think if I were white, I'd want to play at A instead.  This can extend either way for easy life.  Once white has a foothold here, he can look forward to pressing on the black shimari in the lower right.  His goal would be twofold: first of course, reduce black's territory.  But more insidiously, white is looking to exploit black's weakness at B.  Some thickness around C would be just the thing.]
;B[eq]LB[dq:A][hq:B]C[reid: Black gets a bit more territory this way, but he helps white a lot.  Black often plays at A instead so white doesn't get quite so much help.

But keeping the corner here is not very consistent with D10.  Black gets the corner, but he gives up white influence that reduces the area around C8.  On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be any good move around D6 either.

This seems to lead to the conclusion that a pincer (B perhaps?) might be a better way to go.]
;W[fq];B[ep];W[fo];B[jq]LB[jo:B][jp:A]C[reid: Black is jumping the gun here.  The joseki move is black E5.

Ming Jiu: Yes, E5 is joseki, but black can also take white's extension.  But not with K3 - black should play high with A (K4) instead.  The  response to K3 at B(K5) is too easy for white.]
;W[eo]LB[cq:A]C[reid: After white turns here, black has an awkward problem.  The magic move (and a good trick to remember) is white A.  It turns out to be surprisingly difficult to handle this move.  Black's aji is terrible.]
;B[cn];W[jo]LB[el:A][dm:B][bn:I][bo:H][co:G][do:F][cq:C][cr:D]
[er:E]C[Isn't A better ?

reid: If white A, then black B pretty much locks up the left side (perhaps in sente, too).  I think white should probe at C right away and see how black answers.

Ming Jiu: When white wants to play in the corner, the move is at D, not C.  If black blocks at E, he can't stop black pushing down and cutting through black I.  So white will be able to connect with E.]
;B[io]LB[lp:A][qq:B]C[reid: This looks overly aggresive for black.  The proverb says 'play away from strength'.  This looks too close to the very strong F4 wall.  Calmer would be to simply take a large territory with A, looking to attack this whole group later.

Ming Jiu: after black A, the timing is right for white to probe with B]
;W[ip]LB[mb:F][hn:B][in:A][jn:C][ko:D][lq:E]C[reid: but perhaps this isn't white's best choice for handling J5 (although it certainly feels natural).  Hane on the outside (A) seems to work better,  If then black J4, white just connects over with B and black doesn't accomplish much.  Cutting at C is difficult for black: white D threatens a ladder and also white E.  And again, that outside thickness is what white needs to exploit black's weakness at F.

Ming Jiu: Yes, white A is better.];B[jp]C[reid: this doesn't turn out very well for white.]
;W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[jr];W[jn];B[ho];W[hq];B[hm]C[Ming Jiu: This result is very good for black.

Ming Jiu's comments end here.];W[fl];B[hk];W[lo];B[mq]C[Here i was feeling very good

reid: Yes, white seems to have two weak groups.  Not a good strategic position.]
;W[gn]C[reid: OK, around here the play by both sides seems to get a bit erratic.  White M5 is very busy - perhaps overly optimistic.  White G6 seems to be aji-keshi...]
;B[jm]C[reid: if black wants to attack the white stones, a simple bamboo joint is better.  When you touch your opponent's stones, you help them get stronger.  Here, black wants the white K6 stones to stay weak so they're easier to capture.]
;W[gl]C[reid: This looks like more aji-keshi.];B[im]C[reid: Now we can do a small tewari analysis: if black had played the bamboo joint instead of K7, and then white peeps at F8, does black want to respond with K7?  Probably not.]
;W[cl]LB[fj:A]C[reid: this looks lik an overplay given the weakness of the white F5 stones.  Safer to just jump to A.]
;B[ek];W[el]C[First i thought it was a good move but it seems to give white a better eye shape. So is it a good or bad move ?

reid: Do you mean black E9 or white E8?  White E8 seems like the only response to black E9.  But E9 seems odd.  I'm not sure what black is trying to accomplish.  Enclose white?

More natural would be to cut off the overplay with black D8,  but black is hampered by his C3 weakness.  It's a complicated situation - difficult to analyze.  That's why the joseki move is E5 instead of K3.]
;B[dk]LB[ck:A][dl:B][cm:D][dm:C]C[reid: This is a classic empty triangle - very bad shape for black.  If black is trying to keep the area around C12, perhaps A is better than D9.  Then black has the possibility of a ko cut (after black A, black B, white C, black cut with ko at D).

I am going to end the analysis here.  We've covered a lot of ground.

I'd say the deciding factor in this game was white not recognizing black's weaknesses (overplays): first at N18, and later at C3.  White lost the intiative and his F5 stones became a target for attack.  White needed a larger-scale view of the game to take advantage of black's overplays (P18 / M17, and N3).

Black needs to be a bit more patient, and more willing to share the board.  You can't get everything in this game, and in fact you don't want everything.  You just want one point over break-even.  A solid one point lead is far better than a tenuous 50 point lead.  Take the time to make your josekis complete and your positions solid.  You want to be exploiting your opponents' weaknesses, you don't want them exploiting yours.
