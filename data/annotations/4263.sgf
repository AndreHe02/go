C[<DS>Greetings Henry, I will be doing your review today. My comments will begin with DS. This is my first review so please bear with me. I will try and comment on moves that I think were costly or worth little.]
PL[B];B[pp];W[oo]LB[pc:2][dd:3][qd:1][cp:4][dq:5]C[<DS>Not a typical response to a 4/4 stone, but it does claim influence. More typical responses are labeled]
;B[po]C[<DS>During this sequence, black is gaining a lot of territory, while you are just gaining influence that can easily be reduced this early in the game. Try to focus more on territory in the beginning.]

C[<DS>It seems your goal this game is to capture the entire middle, which is really hard to do.]
;W[pd];B[qd];W[nd];B[pc];W[oc];B[pd];W[ne];B[nc];W[mc];B[ob]
;W[nb];B[dp]LB[dd:1][id:2][ig:3]C[<DS>This Ko is worth hardly anything even if black loses it, ignore it and try and capture some territory. 1 starts a battle for the last remaining corner, where as 2 gains a lot of territory and is a threat to turn your giant influence into points with a followup at 3]
;W[oc];B[pb];W[nc];B[dc]C[<DS> SO black lost the KO, but gained all the corners, one entire side, and presence on the other 3 sides. I believe at this point the game is already lost, unless you make some fantastic plays.

Lost Ko = 1 point
2 corners = 15-30 points

So over the last 3 moves, black gained 14-29 points over white.]
;W[na]C[<DS>A completely wasted move, Black is not going to follow you to the edge.]
;B[di]LB[ce:1][cn:2][cq:3]C[<DS>Now black is threatening to claim the entire other side, something has to be done immediately.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[nq];B[or];W[nr];B[iq];W[ns];B[ic];W[ip];B[jq]
;W[jp];B[kq];W[kp];B[lq];W[lp];B[hp];W[ho];B[gp];W[go];B[fp]
;W[fo];B[eo];W[en];B[dn];W[dm]LB[dm:1][em:A][en:2][fo:3]C[<DS> A filled 3 line is a really weak shape without support behind it. It is almost never a good idea to make it. A would have been stronger than 1.]
;B[em];W[fn];B[dl];W[fm];B[el]
(;W[io]C[<DS>J5 is a coverstone that doesnt need to be played, If black plays there, you can just ladder the stone]
;B[ii];W[cl];B[cm];W[ek];B[dk];W[fk];B[ej];W[fl];B[gj];W[ck]
;B[cj];W[bj];B[bi]LB[bi:1][di:4][cj:2][dk:3]C[<DS> The reason he can make the same shape that failed for you, is because of the support stone at 4.]
;W[ci]C[<DS>Place a stone with 1 liberty is never a good idea. ;)]
;B[ch];W[bk];B[bm];W[ai];B[bg];W[bh]C[<DS> Again placing a stone with only 1 liberty, be careful.]
;B[ah];W[mq];B[ik]C[<DS>Oh no, the only territory you have claimed so far this game (the middle), is being invaded. Protect your space!]

(;W[lr];B[hq];W[kr];B[kc]
(;W[mp]C[<DS> Definately no threat of black going there. Your shape was solid.]
;B[lj];W[mr];B[lg];W[jr];B[lm];W[ir];B[jm];W[np]C[<DS> While you are creeping along the bottom, gaining 6 points, black just took away your entire center.]

[pn][po][pp]SQ[oe][og][oh][oi][oj][ok][ol][om][on][oo]C[<DS> This game was pretty much over from the beginning, when you let black claim the entire side while you claimed nothing. You focus too much on making solid walls, when in the end those walls dont enclose any territory. Black played a strong game, and has a much stronger grasp on territory. Try to study black's move, particularly in the opening and look at how many points those moves claimed at the end of the game. For instance, lets take the first 10 moves by each person...At the end of the game, your 10 moves earned 2 points. His 10 moves earned 32 points (the circles). So after
10 moves, he was ahead by 22 points, and the pattern continues if you look at the next 10, etc. Learn how to enclose spaces so that your opponet cannot invade it like black did with the center here. Notice how all your invasions died? (A-E). You would benefit from looking at other 30k games, and try and understand from them. This is the end of the review.
