AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[I'm a beginner --no idea what I'm ranked,.  I feel like I start out okay but lose it in the middles when I get overwhelmed.

[DrK: Dear Peggy, I will try to identify 3 things you should watch out for in your next games and assess your rank (although don't be overly concerned here rank changes).

I find this page very helpful for thinking strategically:

http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrategyForBeginners4Questions

try to read it and ask the 4 questions when you are stuck and don't know where to move.

Cheerrs

-DrK\]]PL[W];W[kd];B[kc]C[[DrK: Good proper response. White now is 1 stone against 2 and white has 2 liberties whereas black stones each has 3.\]]
;W[mc]
(;B[pg]C[[DrK: This move is fine but I prefer L15 - see variation\]]
;W[ie];B[je]C[[DrK: This is a good move - black cuts white's stones. In handicap games especially try to keep your stones connected and opponent's stones disconnected.\]]
;W[eq]
(;B[cn]C[[DrK: The easiest area to surround territory is corner, then side, then centre. So when white approach black should defend corner. See variation\]]
;W[iq]
(;B[gq]C[[DrK: This move looks good - trying to split white into 2 weak groups. However, if white wishes white can connect. In fact white does that later. See variations.

Much better to limit the stones and leave it open if you wish to split it later - see variation.\]]

(;W[jc];B[ic];W[jb]C[I feel already as if I'm following white around which is probably bad when I start out so much ahead.

[DrK: It is good that you are concerned if you are "following white around". It takes time for players to learn to play the highest value move rather than constantly responding to opponent's.

But in this case I have so far found no complaint to your moves. White try to pick fights and you responded by splitting white up and reducing white stones' liberties. I think this is fine.\]]
;B[kb];W[ia];B[ib];W[gr]
(;B[gn]C[[DrK: This move is odd to me.

Usually a stone tries to do any one of the following:

1. secure territory;
2. expand potential territory (moyo);
3. connect your stones;
3. attack opponent while strengthening yourself;
4. disconnecting opponent (which is also an attack move);
5. invade;
6. move that allows 2 eyes to be formed and a group of your stone lives; and/or
7. move that takes away eye shape of opponent.

Your move seems to deal with 2 and 3 but it is oddly placed. See variation.\]]
;W[bd];B[cf];W[gm]
(;B[lq]C[[DrK: I know you don't want to follow opponent around, but at your level it is very often if opponent plays a stone that touches yours you should respond with hana. See variation\]]
;W[di]C[Can I ignore the attaching?  I'm assuming white. Is trying to pick a fight, and it seems like I could spread out my stones a bit before responding.  But maybe I should always respond?

[DrK: You should always look to the entire board and find the highest value move.

Analysis of the current position (http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrategyForBeginners4Questions):

1. Do you have any weak group? Only G3 and it's kinda unimportant.

2. Does your opponent have a weak group? All your opponent's groups not clearly have 2 eyes. So you can attack any of them.

3 - 4 unnecessary to examine.

With such a target rich environment, which is the best white group to attack? I can't answer they are all good.

So to answer your question you can play elsewhere or attack any of the white group in this situation. You can't ignore the attaching all time time but by all mean play elsewhere.\]]
;B[gd]C[[DrK: This move strengthens top left corner. I personally don't like it because black is clearly strong already so it is not as good as simply responding to white's attaching. However, if you play say H15 or F13 I would not have any complaint.\]]
;W[cj]
(;B[ci]C[[DrK: Crosscut has it's use but in handicap game I recommend avoiding it. You are almost always playing against someone who can read better than you so this gives you more possibility to the opponent. See variation.\]]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[bj]
(;B[cl]C[[DrK: White can easily live if played correctly. See variations.\]]
;W[dk];B[ej]
(;W[hq];B[gp];W[co];B[do]C[[DrK: Good move - when in doubt try to keep stones groups connected. Way easier tok keep alive.\]]
;W[em];B[ek];W[qd];B[dl];W[ph];B[pf];W[no]
(;B[ln]C[[DrK: This is a decent move. White's stone approaches. Black attack forcing white to run to centre to live. In the actual game white did push to top and right.

A more advanced concept is direction - when you attack envision which direction white runs to and envision can you take advantage of white when it runs. In this situation it runs to the top which is okay. However, pushing the stone to left would give you more of an advantage. See variation.\]]
;W[ch]C[[DrK: If white continues white captures black stone C11 in a ladder. Since the stone is dead don't keep on adding stones to it. See variation.\]]

(;B[bi];W[pc];B[qe]
(;W[lo];B[ck]C[[DrK: Unnecessary. Black can connect two groups by mimi. See if white tries to capture.

Try to avoid unnecessary moves - which you can use to play elsewhere instead.\]]
;W[ai];B[bh];W[cm];B[ah];W[gk];B[dm];W[eo];B[en];W[fn];B[dn]
;W[kq];B[aj];W[rf]
(;B[qf]C[[DrK: Black does not need to respond - white can't disconnect stones and for S14 to be of use white needs to play S15 first. See variation.\]]
;W[nm]C[Now I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.  So I usually start making mistakes.  Probably I should be more aggressive?  I think I try to kill off stones I don't need to, but sometimes when I let them be, they come back and destroy me.

[DrK: Unfortunately lapse of concentration can always happen - that's why go is so interesting what does not work right now may work later when the board is different.

In your case, you have strong black stone groups all over the board. Criticically speaking black's stone at bottom left may come under attack (G6 group; M6 stone) and need attention.

Only way to deal with how you feel (and every go player feels this I do still when I play against stronger player is to play study and get used to seeing all sorts of shapes, look carefully, play and hope you are correct :)  

However, I am not happy with your next move - does not really achieve any of the usual purpose of playing - refer what I wrote in move 18. See variations.\]]

C[I'm feeling leery of all these white stones here in the lower right side.  Not sure what to do except build up my connections

DrK: Your H4 group needs to be fixed or it can die. And there's 6 white stones in bottom right corner against your 3 so it's time to make a livable shape for both.\]]

;B[cs];W[bs]C[[DrK: This and a few other moves from white are very odd - I can't understand them...\]]

(;B[fp]C[[DrK: If you know this group of stones can be killed at anytime, then you don't have to do it until you have to. Of course if you are worried you may forget that's another story. Anyway see variation.\]]
;W[kk]C[[DrK: Just break through. You don't have to defend.

But black group at L8 is not alive and about to be surrounded - so better do something about it...\]]

[DrK: 3-3 invasion is a very tough thing to learn understand use and defend. Don't be too hard on yourself. However, avoid making groups of stones in corner that if invaded at 3-3 and can't kill it then stones die - key is try to keep your stones connected.

But yes as soon as opponent invade at 3-3 you have to decide - do you have to kill it to live - if so you have to take your time and read it out complete. Move 161 is the only opportunity to kill white group.\]]
;B[mk]C[[DrK: Whole groups are dead - no need to play further.\]]

(;W[lh];B[oc];W[mg];B[of];W[rh];B[pb];W[od]C[I feel like resigning now, but I'll go on a bit further.

[DrK: You need to study life and death and practice lots of tsumego - so you can look at a group of stones and say - dead/alive/not yet alive so got to do sth.

In this case, even without the white move 187 black group R15 is dead - since move 143.\]]

C[I realize. I should stop now, but I tend to play until the computer passes just to see what it does.  At least I assume there's nothing more I can do.

[DrK: No problem with that. However, the computer is not that strong and I think you gets some bad habits from it at endgame...\]]

;B[le];W[tt];B[tt]C[[DrK: Conclusion - you have played quite a few games clearly and have some concepts of play. I think you are around 19-22k mark. It doesn't matter your rank will change a lot.

I suggest you do the following to improve:

1. Play against real people - lots of free online go servers. Quite frankly the computer is not that strong (although I've seen a stronger version on KGS - 3k strength - wonder if it is in public domain) Computer still plays in very odd ways and moves do not logically flow together.
2. Do lots of tsumegos - balance between life and death and midgame - free sets at www.goproblems.com.

If you are on OGS or KGS I am happy to play you - but make sure in the comment note it is a teaching game...

Hope you improve lots!
