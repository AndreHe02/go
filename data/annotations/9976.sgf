;B[pd]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: good luck!];W[dp]C[WhaleOne [?\]: Good luck to you too!



Funny to say "good luck". Not really a game of chance.];B[dc]
;W[qp];B[cj];W[jq];B[jd];W[qf];B[qh];W[rd];B[qc];W[qd];B[pc]
C[WhaleOne [?\]: It was hey, what a battle!];W[of];B[ne]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah, trying to find where it started]
;W[oq]
(;B[ql];W[pi]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: probaby about here
WhaleOne [?\]: yep];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[qk]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: Felt like I shouldnt have played here
sashimi409 [10k?\]: but I wasnt sure what else to do
WhaleOne [?\]: Well I think I went Q9 next yeah? Which was just as risky]
;B[pk]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: But at the same time i didnt have a solid answer
sashimi409 [10k?\]: you just pushed me down to the edge];W[rk]
;B[rl]C[WhaleOne [?\]: Well this is when the fight really starts Id say
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah those first couple were relatively friendly
sashimi409 [10k?\]: but htis is more aggresive
WhaleOne [?\]: Yeah, once I cut you at Q9 that's when it became more aggro
WhaleOne [?\]: Had to be
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah, and if you want me to give you control of the review let me know
WhaleOne [?\]: Though all in all apart from that big group in the top and one ladder you had it overall
WhaleOne [?\]: Nah all good, I'll leave it to you not all that experienced tbh
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Fair enough
sashimi409 [10k?\]: how long you been playing? and what rank did you put for the league?
sashimi409 [10k?\]: if you dont mind me asking
WhaleOne [?\]: I think I sit around 15kyu, though on DGS I'm sitting at like, 22
WhaleOne [?\]: One group I played with in person smashed me but reckoned I was mid teens
sashimi409 [10k?\]: ok, in that case im better than I thought I was. I havent played in a while, but have done a lot of like reading and reviewing of games
sashimi409 [10k?\]: what server do yoiu usually play on? tygem?]
;W[pl];B[ok];W[rj]C[WhaleOne [?\]: Normally I play on Dragon Go Server, which is basically by email, been a while since Ive played a real time game
sashimi409 [10k?\]: KGS is a better community but usually slower
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Ah ok
WhaleOne [?\]: Now I screwed up with these two stones around here I'd say
sashimi409 [10k?\]: So for you, I think hre instead of playing Q12
sashimi409 [10k?\]: i would play here]
(;B[ph]C[WhaleOne [?\]: Occasionally on Tygem but don't like it, too much salt and gaming, though it's quick]
;W[oi]
(;B[og]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: this though
WhaleOne [?\]: Yeah my move was way too slow
sashimi409 [10k?\]: really got me
WhaleOne [?\]: I was focused more on joining my groups here
sashimi409 [10k?\]: and it worked pretty well
sashimi409 [10k?\]: ended up being a big part of you keeping the top right till the end
WhaleOne [?\]: Yeah, for the most part I felt confident I was going to keep that corner
WhaleOne [?\]: Less so though once I saw I was going to lose R and S 8 stones]
;W[oh];B[pg];W[ng];B[pf];W[nf];B[oe];W[rf]
(;B[cn]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: real fast I think this was smart
sashimi409 [10k?\]: took a big move since you had the chance
WhaleOne [?\]: Yeah, I think this game me more of the game than anything else]
;W[fp]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: yeah that corner i ended up getting very few points]

(;B[bp];W[cq];B[fn]C[e6 probably better]
(;W[ho];B[hn];W[in];B[hm];W[im]
(;B[il]
(;W[ip];B[hl]C[WhaleOne [?\]: Let me really build that influence there into the center
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah
WhaleOne [?\]: Again, dreaming of linking groups
sashimi409 [10k?\]: this is where I was getting nervous you were gonna connect above me to the fighting group
sashimi409 [10k?\]: I think as a whole you succeeded in not having too many weak groups
WhaleOne [?\]: That was what I was hoping to do, plus at the same time building plenty of influence (Moyo i think?)
sashimi409 [10k?\]: except both of us in the fight haha
WhaleOne [?\]: lol yeah. Turtling up as much as I could
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah, it let you keep a lot of the left
sashimi409 [10k?\]: which ultimately won you the game
sashimi409 [10k?\]: tried my best to reduce it htough];W[nk]
;B[ol];W[om]SQ[nl]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: So you missed this atari here
WhaleOne [?\]: dang!]
(;B[nl];W[pm];B[mm]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: again, i never expect the diagnol and it throws me off
WhaleOne [?\]: Same motive as above, trying to link the groups

no need to link the groups. r8 has 3 liberties. r9 has 3 as well. it is a race to kill. whoever starts first wins the capturing race]
;W[qm]C[WhaleOne [?\]: wasn't confident with that group in the fight
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah, I was pretty confident I could kill them till that move
sashimi409 [10k?\]: so i decided to threten those two stones
WhaleOne [?\]: Yeah those stones are pretty gone at this stage
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah i think this was the move that really sealed their fate
sashimi409 [10k?\]: ecen if they werent taken off the board till the end
WhaleOne [?\]: definitely, I regretted even playing another stone on them






oops for black];B[rm];W[rn]C[WhaleOne [?\]: Don't know what I was thinking, bit of a panic move
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah, you have good strategy, and are pretty good about linking up your stones it seems
sashimi409 [10k?\]: but sacrificing and some small life or death got you in a couple places
WhaleOne [?\]: Cheers. My strategy is fine, but the tactics in a fight is lacking]

(;B[nj];W[mk];B[nh];W[ni];B[mh];W[mi];B[mg]C[WhaleOne [?\]: though I pushed around a few ladders and potential big captures later on]
;W[mf];B[lf]C[WhaleOne [?\]: like there
sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah
WhaleOne [?\]: but there's a point later on that you capped three stones that again, I didn't even see the atari
sashimi409 [10k?\]: i was really sad about that
WhaleOne [?\]: It gave me a little more confidence in the life of the group
sashimi409 [10k?\]: cause i even read out the ladder and thought i would get out, but then double checked after the move and realized i failed]
;W[sm]C[wasted move by white];B[mj];W[lj];B[oj];W[li];B[lh]
C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: this move was good
WhaleOne [?\]: Yeah, thought to make another eye
sashimi409 [10k?\]: at least to me. i thought i was being clever and could get those three stones, but you saved them with a move i didnt see


no, not a good move. just capture with n15];W[ml];B[nm];W[lm]

[ee][ke]C[sashimi409 [10k?\]: Yeah i think you missing that put me back in the game
WhaleOne [?\]: That loss made me very sad, gave you life
WhaleOne [?\]: definately
sashimi409 [10k?\]: and from here on out is just defining borders and endgame stuff


not engame yet


triangles all dead.

ABCD in seriour danger

squares are invasion and reduction points for white.

game should be over. white wins by a lot

computer says black by 37.5 but doesn't understant that blacks side of the board can be reduced and white's is solid.]

(;B[dn];W[bq];B[bn]C[WhaleOne [?\]: You got that Diagonal going on now
sashimi409 [10k?\]: hahah yeah, saw someone using it pretty well ;)


is d6 doing anything useful here? No. you'd have an extra point if it wasn't there. When you did play it, you could have played b6 instead. Then if white played b3, it would be your move (with one extra point). Now it is white's move.]
