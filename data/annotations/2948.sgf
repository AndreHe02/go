C[Ok,  I guess right now what I'm working on is trying to get away from  bad  shapes.  So that is for the most part what I want help on with in this  review.  Also, as I go through this myself I will point out some of the  vital  points I see, If you see any important ones that I neglect please point  those  out as well.

>> Hi. I am alpha, 4k on KGS.  I am also not very good at shapes. Hope I can give you some help.]
;B[qd]C[How do you address komoku?  I'm fairly good with hoshi josekis,  but  dont know much about this one. Could you show a few variations on this  joseki?

>> At this point, just don't worry about the josekis.  Try to occupy other corners. One of the most go principles is corner first, side second, and center last. The  choice of josekis are all dependent on the whole board situation. And keeping initiative (sente) is also very important. Check variation for some common josekis for komoku.]

(;W[jj]C[Tengen!  I've decided to use tengen for a while in my games and  see  how they turn out.

 >> Usually it is not good for amateur players to play the first move at tengen, especially when you are white. Playing at tengen means that you concentrate on center which is hard to form territories.]
;B[dq];W[fc]LB[cc:1][ic:2][dd:A][cf:3]C[Very strange huh?  Well let me  explain my  reasoning behind this move.  

I figured that he would respond at or around A, in which case I would  either  play 1 or 2.

Once again I was experimenting a bit with my joseki here...

>> Yeah. It looks weird to me. However, If black plays at A, it will be good for white  when white plays at  3. (This joseki is  popular known in Chinese as "double  flying swallows", which is no good for  black.   So most probably  black will not play at A.]
;B[qp]LB[pp:A]C[>> Good idea for black to tenuki at the left up corner and take the remaining unoccupied corner. However. all 3 black stones are in the third line, which maybe is not very good since white's strategy is to develop territories in the center.  Maybe A is better. (Proverb says the 3rd line is for territory and the 4th line is for influence.)]
;W[cd]LB[cj:A]C[He ignored the move, so I decided to exert some influence  over  the corner.

>> Good move for white. One corner is secured. And the move around A is  becoming important both for black and white.]
;B[qj]LB[cj:A]C[>> again too lower for black.  A is better.]
;W[pg]LB[qg:A]C[This turned out well for me, however I was  wondering if  A could have worked too?

I felt it was a little too dangerous.

>> Actually this is a bad move. What's  that for? Form territory in the center? Too early.]
;B[qg]LB[od:A]C[>> I think playing A is much better. To counteract the white influence.]
;W[qh]LB[ph:A]C[>> Black can cut at A. With 2 other stones as support, the fight will not be bad for black.  See variation.]

(;B[pf];W[rg];B[oc]LB[qf:B][ph:A]C[I wonder why he didnt play at A..?  or B even

>> That move is really crazy. Connecting at B is good enough. Now playing at B is  very nice for white.]
;W[ph]LB[of:C][qf:F][og:B][oh:E][ph:A][pi:D]C[Bad shape I know, but didn't  know what  else to do.

Any of those a good alternative to A?

>> Don't understand this move either. Playing at F is the only choice that I will think of.]
;B[qm];W[oq]C[>> Black can benefit from attacking this  stone.]
;B[oo];W[rq]LB[lq:C][qq:A][qr:B]C[A or B probably would have been better.

>> white is looking for trouble. C is the way to get settled. You can play A or B later. Remember the black group is already settled. You need to settle yourself as soon as possible.]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[qr]LB[np:B][mq:A][qr:C]C[If he would have played A instead of extending  what  could I do.  Could I even for sure form two eyes?

>> That's a good question. If he plays at A, you will be in big trouble. You need to worry about playing at B or C. If you play at C, black will play around B and you  are blocked and need to live small immediately. If you play at B and black will play at C.]
;W[kq]LB[jq:B][lq:1][mq:A]C[I wonder why I decided to jump so far leaving him  such  an appealing place to split at A.  Playing at 1 was a much safer route  but do  you think it was necessary?  What if he had played A for instance, and  we  both enter a fight for life.  Who would win?  How might that go?

>> surely black should play at A and you  are in inferior condition. See variation. If you play at 1, B is a good place for black to play.]

(;B[mp];W[mq];B[lp];W[lq]C[>> black helped white here a lot.  White now is almost settled. White already has stone in the center, Black cannot form a big moyo here.]
;B[gq];W[co]LB[cp:A][cq:B]C[Is A a possibility here?   If it  is, would it turn out better than how I played?

>Don't like A. If you like fighting, you can do that. All fightings need a good reason.   If you play at A, black will play at B.]
;B[cj]C[>> black should play at here long time ago.];W[cl];B[cg]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[hq];B[gp];W[ip];B[ek];W[em];B[gn];W[bq];B[do]
;W[dn];B[eo];W[fl]LB[fl:A]CR[em][dn][co]C[Seems like a very  bad /  dangerous shape, if you could call it one.

>> the shape doesn't look good, but black has no good way to attack it. A is very important to get out.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[lc]LB[hc:C][kc:B][lc:A]C[>> The move of A is too small.  B will be better.  If he is bold, he can play at C. The white in the upper left corner is weak.]
;W[ic]C[>> so now white has a big corner. Good  move for white.]
;B[ef]LB[bf:E][dh:D][eh:A][di:C][ei:B]C[Since I have  two  fairly strong groups on each side of his group what would be a good way  to  attack it?

If it is possible to kill or just turn out in a way that gives me  better  influence towards the center could you show a variation or two.

>> There is no way that you can kill it. The upper left corner is still weak. Once he got  any move at A,B,C or D, he can capture your E stone and easily live.]
;W[ee];B[df];W[ff];B[ce]LB[bf:A]C[>> this is a thank-you move. Help white to connect his A stone and protect the  corner.]
;W[be];B[fg];W[fe]C[Another empty triangle...     :(      

Alternatives?

>> This is not  an empty triangle. This is a good triangle. Now corner is quite solid.]
;B[in];W[ni]LB[mg:B][nh:A]C[This is just asking to be cut.    Would A  have been safer, or am I ok with this move?

>> There is no danger to be cut.  However, Maybe B is better. Black has no influence in the center.]
;B[oj];W[ng]C[Table ^_^];B[jo];W[ko];B[kp];W[jp];B[jn]LB[kn:A]
[ho:B]C[>> bad move for black. That move doesn't prevent white's potential cut move at B. So A is better for black.]
;W[ln];B[ml]C[>> So black made mistakes. Black  has to pay back something in killing the 2 white stones.]
;W[np];B[no]LB[mo:A]C[>> Black need to move at A to capture the 2 white stones while allowing white to thrust out..]
;W[mo];B[mn]LB[mm:B][mn:A]SQ[ml][no]C[Hum going after these stones  sure  let his right corner get fairly secure.  :(   Was this a bad idea for  me or  was there not much i could do anyways at this point to attack that  area?

>> no way to attack that area.  Black is already very solid.  But the move at A is really bad.  White can play at B.]
;W[lm];B[mm]LB[ho:A][hr:B]C[Maybe you should play the cut move at A.]

(;W[kl];B[hp];W[hr];B[gr];W[cr];B[dr];W[dp]LB[br:A]C[Should have played A instead :(

>> This white move only earned one point  while losing one liberty. Not very good.  White should play at A as soon as possible. A can be  sente for black.]

(;B[ep];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[pd]LB[of:A]C[He should have played A I think.]
;W[of]LB[oe:A]C[I should have also played A instead of capturing; right?

>> maybe.];B[dl];W[el]LB[dm:A]C[>> better to play at A.];B[ck]
;W[dm]LB[bl:A]C[Would A have been better?

>> yeah.];B[dk]LB[bl:A]C[had he played A now instead of closing I might have  been in  trouble.]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[fk];B[fj];W[hl];B[hg];W[cf]LB[de:A];B[de];W[dd]
C[Lost Sente, c14  probably not good move :(

>> One good thing is that you have eliminated all bad aji in the corner.]
;B[ke]C[He responded nice and hurt my chances of getting a large group  in the  middle.

>> yeah. B did nicely.];W[eg];B[dg];W[gg];B[eh];W[fh];B[eg]
LB[gh:A]C[>> B shouldn't connect it.  should play A instead.]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[hh];B[ig];W[gh]C[Hum, guess I didnt want a ko battle for some reason.  What are  some  key points I missed while doing this, and giving him sente again? >> connecting is good.]
;B[ne];W[kb];B[lb];W[jg];B[kg];W[jf];B[kf];W[ih];B[li]LB[gj:A]
C[>> This move doesn't much sense.  A is better.];W[lk];B[mj]
C[>> bad move. don't know what b wants to do? no need to connect.]
;W[nk]C[>> good move. B is doomed to lose.];B[nj];W[mk];B[ol]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[rj];B[rk]LB[ri:A][qm:B]C[A probably should have been the move, If I ran he had the stone  at B  to help stop.   BAD MOVE FOR ME at S10!]
;W[ri];B[ql]C[>> no need for this move.];W[nn]C[Another bad move!]
;B[nm]LB[om:A]C[B should play at A.];W[op];B[po];W[nl];B[on]
;W[kh];B[lh];W[ki];B[nf];W[oe];B[od];W[mh];B[jc];W[jb]LB[kc:B]
[jd:A]C[Would playing at A or B had given me any better of a  response?

>> your move is ok.
