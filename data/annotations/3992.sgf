C[Hi,

I think this game more or less represents how I play these days, so I would like to have a "check-up". All comments are welcome, since I seem to have hit a deadlock.

Thank you very much in advance.

ME:I personally would prefer to strenghten the stones on the left side,maybe c7 but this cant be too bad I think too]
;W[ce]C[hm,in addition to c4 this move rather helps blac get strong on the left side.nore normal moves are c13 and d12 in such a situation where c4 exists]

I think you made the right choice
1.you secured your own group
2.you still got some profit
and 
3.theres still some aji there so you may use it later];W[lc]

C[all in all I would say this game wasnt so bad of yours overall,but you sometimes misread simple things(like the one in the end) and also play some overplays that hardly ever work,:-(.
but if you do some go problems you'll sure improve soon.])
