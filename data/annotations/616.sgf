C[Hi! This game is commented by NicklasE (NNGS 8k, IGS 11k).
B has requested some comments about this game. I will make comments based on my skill and experience. Please don´t hesitate to contact me if you have questions about my comments.

Note: For a simple to use joseki and fuseki dictionary I recommend Jan van der Steen's web pages: http://www.cwi.nl/~jansteen/go/]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[dc];W[pq]C[B has choosen a low position in both corners. The problem with this may be the lack of influence to the center. On the other hand it may secure some points in the corners.]
;B[co]C[By C5 black is still choosing a low position, and personally I think this is a slow move. Compare this with black stones at: D3, D9 and D16 as in the chineese opening.
In this position I would have played D5 or D6 instead.  In this position an important followup for B is maybe K4 or L3.]
;W[ce];B[cd]C[I don't like this move. B may get the corner and some points along the upper side but may lose influence of the center. Which are the possible Joseki moves? (D15? F16? E15?) Or why not a pincer at C12?]
;W[de];B[iq]C[Ohh...I would not leave the upper side yet. How about G17 (or perhaps E16,F16) instead?
By the way, I don't think J3 is a good followup to the D3-C5 stones. I would prefer K4. Another possibility would be L3.]
;W[kq]C[This is a good trade for white. It would not have been that good if B played K4.]
;B[gc]C[Ok, back on track. I think F16 is also playable.];W[ci]
;B[nc]C[B may end up in trouble here if white gets a strong position on the right side. How about playing Q10 instead. That would give B a position on the right side. Another possiblity might be Q5 or R5, but it is hard to say since W may counter attack with a pincer move. Then it would probably be problem for both players if "beginners".]
;W[nd]C[Yes, W is choosing the correct joseki in this position. If W gets first to Q10 now then B will have some trouble.]
;B[mc]C[Ohhh...what is this? This move is very bad. Now W is forced to make even more territory. The joseki move is N16.]
;W[md]C[And W is not missing the oppertunity.];B[pc];W[qc];B[pb]
;W[qb]C[Maybe W should play at another point. W wants to get to Q10.]
;B[kb]C[B is always choosing low positions. It is to defensivly. How about M16 instead. B might loose some stones but with that terrible shape if think it will be very expensive to get all to survive.]
;W[lc]C[Good move by W. B is in very big trouble. The drawback with this move is that W will want to get back and play M16 and it will possible for B to play around Q10.]
;B[lb];W[ld];B[ic]C[The problem with the sequence from W was that B got sente. This move must be played on the right side of the board.]
;W[pj]C[And here we go...W has a very good position now.];B[jj]
C[And B notice that. What should B do?
I see what B is trying to do with K10, but I think it is the wrong way. B is in such a bad position that the only thing that will help is an invasion at the right side: Q5?, R5? R10??]
;W[qo]C[This is a slow move by W. Now B may reduce the possible moyo.]
;B[ig]C[I assume that B wants to link up the K10 stone with his stones on the top. But how about K5 instead? J13 is definitly the wrong direction!]
;W[mj]C[Ok, now W wants to make an enormous moyo.];B[jm]C[I can't see the use with this move. This will only help W to build moyo and B don't get anything in return.]
;W[lm];B[lg]C[Could B C9 be playable? But, anyway, W's moyo is getting to big. This might be the last move that it is possible to invade. How about throwing in a stone somewhere on the R-line?]
;W[ng];B[mf]C[No, please...do do this...B will not gain anything by this.]
;W[nf];B[mh]C[W's moyo get secured: "never let opponent sequre moyo"]
;W[nh]C[And B is not very secured. What happens after a W N13-stone?]
;B[ko];W[lo];B[kp];W[lp]C[B might get a moyo of his own now.]
;B[jq];W[kr];B[lk]C[No, no...C9 instead?];W[mk];B[ll];W[ml]
;B[km];W[kn];B[jn];W[ln];B[lj];W[mi];B[li];W[cl]C[This move should have been played by B. How about doing some counting?
W: 15+100=115p
B: 25+15 (LL corner)+15? (center)+35? (possible moyo)=90p
B must do something! It will be not be possible to get more points and it will be hard to reduce W.]
;B[bm]C[This will not make any moyo. And that kind of move is not very good. Look what happens when W replies with B8.]
;W[bl]C[B now needs two moves at C7 and D8 to get anything out that stone.]
;B[be]C[There must be bigger moves than this? This is an end-game move. If B want to reduce it must be easy to attack the W-group from the right. How about C12 or C13?]
;W[bf];B[bd];W[dg];B[fg]C[I don't see what B is aiming at?]
;W[ei];B[fi]C[If the intesion is to secure some territory then I would suggest not to play attach moves.]
;W[eh];B[ek]C[A lot of weak B stones that W can run through?]
;W[ej];B[dk];W[ck];B[dj];W[cj];B[eg];W[fh];B[gh];W[fj];B[hi]
C[I don't see the point with H11. How about W F7 (or F8) now?]
;W[gi];B[hg];W[hj];B[gl]C[And B has wasted a lot of moves to no use :(]
;W[fk];B[em];W[dm];B[el];W[bn];B[cn];W[cm];B[bo];W[am];B[dn]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[fe];B[ge];W[fd];B[fc];W[gd];B[hd];W[gf]C[B is leaving a lot of bad aji behind. I think it is better to realise that B won't get any territory there and play somewhere else.
How about securing the moyo around G5? W also still has the monkey jump on the lower side.]
;B[gg];W[he];B[ie];W[dd];B[ec];W[ii];B[jh];W[hh];B[ji]C[B has to read out the sequences better. These kind of terrible moves are otherwise only played in (too) fast games.]
;W[hk];B[hl];W[ik];B[il];W[jk];B[kk];W[fl];B[fm]C[W is playing a friendly game...and still it gets terrible for B :(]
;W[mg];B[lh];W[lf];B[kf];W[le];B[hf];W[ge];B[cf];W[cg];B[ed]
;W[df];B[ee]C[Ohhh...W is also leaving some bad aji :)];W[gq]
C[The monkey-jump would be the standard move here (I guess).]
;B[jr];W[ks];B[js];W[eq]C[At this point the invasion should not survive. Just make sure that there are no weak spots. There is no eyespace for W. But if W can get to the cutting points B may loose some stones.]
;B[er]C[I think D2 would be enough.];W[fr];B[ep];W[fq];B[dr]
;W[go]C[Ok, W is going for the cutting points. Just make sure to keep the B stones together and W will not be able to survive.]
;B[gn];W[hp];B[ip];W[fo];B[fp];W[io];B[in]C[Oh no...B must keep his stones together!]
;W[jo];B[jp];W[ho]C[This was a terrible result for B.];B[hq]
;W[hr];B[gp];W[ir];B[fs];W[is]C[Should we count again? No. W has even more points now and B has much less.]

;B[sp]C[Ohh...maybe both playes should practice how to defend against invasions :)]

;W[tt]C[Final comment: Don't try to build big walls and secure territory. It will almost never work. Make sure to get influence of all parts of the board and you will avoid big moyos as W's moyo in this game. Look at games between players that are 5-10 (igs-)stones better and you will understand much of the game and you will (hopefully) also see what is important in different situations.

Finally: if you play at NNGS and you see me logged on, please don't hesitate to ask me to kibitz your game! /NicklasE]
