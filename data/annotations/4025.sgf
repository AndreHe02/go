C[Dear Reviewer,

I am 2k(IGS) with black and playing with another 2k with white.

The game was quite plane and no big fighting. But I would sincerely ask for advice as in big fighting there would always some big mistake in either side (black or white) and should easily be located and also seldom applicable to other game. But in plane game, it seems we may need more technique, strategy, in controlling the game. Do you aggree ?

Thank you in advance for your kindly advice

I think white 56-70 pretty good.
1. this was the most empty area.
2. white get this area
3. I think white get a good shape here.
4. black get something?];B[hb];W[rg];B[rh];W[hd];B[ee];W[hc]

I cannot see where white moyo is?
F13 seems good to me cause white A16 group do not have 2 clear eyes, and white L18 group may be weak, too.]
