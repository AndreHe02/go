Hi!
MK> 
MK> My name is Michal and I'll review this game. My comments will always be prefixed with "MK>". Let's get to it!

(;B[mn]C[MK> This is too much, you should press on the R8 stone immediately (see variation).]
;W[lp];B[cj]TR[mn][on][qn]SQ[qi][qj]C[MK> You should use your new strength with the marked stones. Move like the squared R10 or R11 are possible to put pressure on the R8 stone.]
;W[qi]C[MK> Now white made base on the third line so it will be much harder to attack effectively.]

(;B[qp]TR[rp][qq]C[This move is not good. Actually I don't know what to do with the r8 pincer. Is it better to run further?

MK> No, running is not necessary. Your stones are still relatively safe. The corner is still open, so you could've tried moves like S4 or R3 instead. Your three stones are close to the center and you have a lot of influence on the board. You can treat them light if you need to. Moreover, white stones at R8 and R11 are low (third line) so not in a perfect possion to attack just yet.]
;W[po]
(;B[pn]C[MK> If your idea was to enter the corner why back off now? See variation.]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[rp];B[rn];W[qq];B[ol]TR[nk]C[Feel like this group is very unsafe. Is it? How to strengthen it?

MK> Going into the corner is no longer an option, so a stone added to this group is probably wise. But P8 is too close. The higher your wall is the further apart you can play. Here obviously the wall is against a white group, but even so, black could try O9, it feels like a much better shape than P8.]
;W[cn]TR[fc][nc][fq]C[MK> That's a strange move from white, especially since there are more open alternatives (marked) on the board. Instead, white played directly in the area of black's influence. Black should happily attack.]

(;B[fq]C[MK> Since black already has a stone at C10 this is too weak. See alternative.]
;W[iq];B[bp];W[cl];B[jc]TR[ej]C[MK> This is not the right time to tenuki. Black should make profit by attacking the weak white group. E10 is a start.]
;W[fc]TR[ec]C[MK> White again plays in the middle of black influence. Black should serverly attack white. Denying white access to corner (marked E17) is a good start.]
;B[df];W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[bb];W[dc];B[bc]C[MK> Now white has a comfortable life.]
;W[mc];B[gc]TR[je]C[Should I push to the right side like l16 or l15?

MK> Touching moves are defensive moves. Since black still has some influence in the area, K15 (marked) seems like a better idea. The move radiates strength to both sides, allowing to put some pressure on both white groups.]
;W[ed]
(;B[de];W[gd];B[hd]TR[gb]C[MK> This mistake only made white stronger. Playing G18 instead is a better idea. Helps black establish a base and hopes to steal the base from white.]
;W[hc];B[gb];W[hb];B[fb];W[eb];B[oc]TR[jc][hd]C[MK> Switching back here means black is likely to abandon the two marked stones. Because white is now strong at the top, black cannot hope to attack the N17 stone effectively.]
;W[qf];B[rd];W[me];B[ek]C[MK> Good thinking. This is the weakest white group on the board and black can gain a lot by attacking it.]
;W[em];B[fe];W[fd];B[ge]LB[fd:B][fe:A][ge:C]C[MK> While previous move was sente, this isn't. White could've ignored this move. Black is still too weak to capture this white group. This means that this whole exchange (A-B-C) is not necessary at this point.]
;W[id];B[gk]C[MK> Good, continue attacking.];W[he];B[hf]LB[hn:A]
TR[cl][em][cn]C[MK> That point is worthless compared to being able to capture the marked white group. A move like "A" could solidify black's capture.]
;W[if];B[hg];W[ee];B[ef];W[gm];B[im]LB[ik:B][hl:A][il:C]TR[gk]
C[MK> The relation between those two marked stones isn't very strong, because there's a very clear weak point at "A". Usually you play either a one space jump ("B") or knight's move ("C").

MK> Another thing to consider is whenever this is the right side to play now. White is much closer to its bottom group now, so separating it from the bottom seems like a better idea than separating it from the top.]

;W[dj];B[dk]C[Is it a better way to deal with d10?

MK> Yes, see variation in move 76.];W[ck]

;B[bh];W[dj];B[ej];W[cj]
(;B[mo]TR[kk][lk][ml][nl]C[MK> This move only solidifies white's territory and doesn't give black anything back.

MK> Instead, try to find some moves that either make you territory or take territory from white. Reductions like that are about playing at the boundaries.

MK> Imagine the boundary in the center marked with triangles. Now consider the alternative move and see how it affects the boundary. Try applying your imagination like that when deciding your next move.]

(;B[km]C[MK> Try directing your enemy towards your strength, not away from it. See alternative move.]

C[MK> That's a very nice shape!];W[oh]
(;B[ni]TR[nh]C[MK> Remember the rule "Hane at the head of two stones." O12 is better move in this case.]
;W[sp]LB[fc:B][jc:D][cl:A][ql:C]C[MK> End game follows here, but the game has been decided already, so this is my last comment.

MK> Black could've won if he captured group A or if he attacked group B or C more severly. Death of group D also didn't help, as white made a lot of points at the top, right in the middle of black's previous influence.]
