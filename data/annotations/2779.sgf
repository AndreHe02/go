C[Hi, I am around 1k* on IGS. I lose this game W+13.5. I would appreciate some comments on the game and what I need to work on. Thank you.]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[dp];W[pd];B[qf]TR[de]C[Some professionals give the advice "make the largest possible extension"
In this situation i personnaly would apply this and prefer the marked kakari.  However, this is probably a matter of taste too.]
;W[nc];B[rd];W[qc];B[qi];W[cf];B[dj]LB[ic:C][cm:B][jp:A]TR[cj]
C[As there is already a solid low white stone in this direction, I would prefer the low extension (triangled)
On the other hand, this side is perhaps not the most important one.  White has a low solid stone there so extending is not urgent for him either (his shimari points towards the upper side).  Therefore, I think other points might be better, e.g. the sanrensei+double wing (A), a shimari (B) or if you dont like moyo, a splitting move (C) with miai for extension]
;W[nq]
(;B[pn]LB[lq:A]C[A is another possibility.  Compare the end of the variation with the end of the game variation]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[kq]TR[dj]C[Somehow, one now feels that the marked triangled stone is not fully effective.  As white has a stable group at the bottom, there is no real opportunity for a large moyo.  Black would have prefered now playing this stone on the third line.]
;B[fc]LB[fc:B][ic:A][lc:C]C[The simple idea for black is to play A after which he can extend to B or C.]
;W[ic]C[now white can attack];B[fe];W[dh]TR[ed][de][ie]C[This doesnt look ideal to me.  A black invasion in the corner is still possible. Perhaps one should also consider the marked points.]

(;B[dd]C[Perhaps this pushing is a bit aji keshi?
whites corner gets solid.
Perhaps the variation is playable too?];W[cd];B[db];W[cc];B[ec]
;W[fq]
(;B[cn];W[dr]
(;B[fp]LB[cn:A][dr:B]C[I think this tsuke is not so good.
And if black wants to play it, he should do so before exchanging A for B.
In the game, the corner is still open, white in the joseki in the variation, black is better]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[hq]LB[fo:A][cq:B]TR[fp][gp]SQ[hp]C[The three triangled stones are about worth one white stone at square as in the joseki ?
so the real difference is that black played A instead of B.  B looks bigger]

(;B[pk]C[black takes territory but is not very active

perhaps it would be better to first play some kikashi against the white group below (which is solid anyway).  See variation.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[qg]
(;B[rg]TR[pk]C[after blacks defensive move, one would hope that some more aggressive variation is possible here]
;W[rf];B[pg]LB[qe:B][re:E][pf:D][sf:C][rh:A]C[I thought about S12 here
S12 probably leads to the same sequence, except the white stone at r13 is not completely captured?  
playing Black A, White B, C, D, E connecting one stone is rather submissive.]
;W[qe];B[qh];W[re]

Can white really do much if black plays tenuki?];W[kd]TR[ia]

black sente

so white is already ahead.

why not foloow up at A?]
(;W[fg]LB[cj:A][cq:B]C[Black is secure already.
Threfore, white should just maintain his lead by playing big endgame as A or B i think]
;B[bi]LB[bi:B][ci:A]C[I prefer A instead of B (has better follow up, no cutting point).]

He missed the chance to kill a white group (which white could defend, but white was careless).
