AB[pd][dp]C[schweik [11k\]: hi];W[pq]C[this is an interesting game I played with white.
The bigest questions I have is how I should have Å¡played invading blacks upper right corner, I feel like my tactics could be better. this is my  strugle recently (ie could i have killed b conter group ? )

(;B[ce]C[TJ: Black normally plays hane on the other side.];W[ef]
;B[de];W[cg];B[ec]
(;W[qf]C[TJ: A big point, but remember that "Vital points come before big points". If Black cuts at E13, you'll have a very hard fight on your hands.]

(;B[nc]C[TJ: Black should cut at E13.];W[pi]C[TJ: A bit unconventional.  Normal is S16 followed by R11, but White can play Q10 if he wants to preserve the possibility of invading at R17.]

(;B[pm]C[TJ: Looks a funny place to invade, even if it is the centre of White's formation (between Q3 and Q11). Maybe Black was worried that White would play at R8 or R7 in response to an approach at 5.]
;W[qo]C[TJ: I think this is a very good move. White undermines Q7 and makes an enclosure.]
;B[po];W[ql]C[TJ: Looks natural, but R6 is far too good a point to allow Black.]
;B[qn]C[TJ: Black should be delighted to get this point. Although the "cat's face" is vulnerable to a peep at P6, it is still a strong shape, especially when it also makes a hane against an opposing stone.]
;W[qp];B[rn]C[TJ: This looks wrong. Black is aiming at getting monkey jumps on both sides, but this early in the game it is far more important to get good shape and strong fighting formations. White can now damage Black's shape with a peep and then attack.]

(;W[nq]C[TJ: Not very severe.];B[pl]C[TJ: Good: Black is settling his shape, and White can't get very much territory because of S6.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[pj]C[TJ: This makes one more point than R10, but it has bad aji. Black might later be able to play such a move as S11.]
;B[fd]C[TJ: Black probably needs to play another move to settle his stones in the lower right.]

(;W[gc]C[TJ: White should ignore F17 and seize his chance to attack in the lower right. Always ask yourself whether you need to respond to the opponent's move, or whether there's a better move available elsewhere.]
;B[gd];W[hc];B[lc]C[TJ: If you're going to attack like this, why not play at L17 and make more territory while making it harder for White to get a satisfactory base?]
;W[hd];B[ff];W[jc];B[eg];W[eh];B[fg];W[dh];B[qe]
(;W[dn]C[TJ: It's a big move, but Q14 is a vital point. Vital points must be taken before big ones.]

(;B[cl]C[TJ: Black is allowing White to dictate to him. Black should ignore the approach and seize the urgent point at Q14.]
;W[cj];B[cn]
(;W[fq]C[TJ: Too soft. It may get messy, but you need to stop Black linking up his stones easily on the left.]
;B[dq]C[TJ: Good move. Black solidifies his position.];W[fo]
C[TJ: This looks good - certainly more positive than playing conservatively with K4.]
;B[do];W[jp]C[TJ: This is good now because F5 makes it somewhat harder for Black to invade.]
;B[lq]C[TJ: H3 would be better since it has support from D3. This is too near Black's weak group on the right.]

(;W[mo]C[TJ: Good idea to split the two enemy weak groups. How about playing a kikashi (forcing move) at P6 first to damage Black's shape?]
;B[lo];W[lp]C[TJ: I don't know if this is good or not. Usually, though, it's not enough to cut a one-point jump or knight's move escape in such deep invasion situations - it's generally better to try and attack the whole group, aiming to profit elsewhere if you cannot kill.]

(;W[il]C[TJ: Better to hold back and enclose from  distance with H9. Black manages to rescue the larger part of his stones by exploiting the cutting points. Remember, "ATTACK FROM A DISTANCE"!]

;W[er];B[fr];W[cm]C[TJ: A bit peculiar! Why not just connect at E3? If Black were to get sente to play E3, he might suddenly get a large profit in the corner! If White connects at E3, then White has either this ko sequence or C2 (or B1) to reduce the corner further.]

;B[lh];W[eb];B[db];W[fa];B[eq]C[TJ: This is large! Black gets a lot of profit in the corner which he would not have had had you connected (between 10-15 points, bearing in mind that White loses the monkey jump or the jump to C2).]

If Black reduces at about G9 it is hard to see White getting more than 25 points on the left side. Meanwhile, White is is trouble on the right, as the continuation shows...]

(;W[on];B[gc];W[pn];B[qm]C[TJ: This would be dire for Black - certainly, Black's losses in the lower right would outweigh whatever he has gained in the top left. Defending the string of stones from S6 to Q9 will be a real burden.]
