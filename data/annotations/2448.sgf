C[I can't believe I lost this game, but I can't figure out what my big mistake has been, thanks for helping me out!

;W[np];B[nq];W[op]C[joseki would be N4 instead of P4

eek: Yes, but up to here, completely normal.];B[mq];W[oq];B[or]

(;B[pp]C[eek: Not severe enough.];W[qp];B[jq]C[I didn't feel too happy about this, because I had given white points in the corner, I think I did something wrong here, maybe Q2 wasn't the right move

eek: Yes, you missed a good opportunity.];W[gq]C[Jeng [?\]: tel brb
kenji [3k\]: ok
Jeng [?\]: back];B[cq]C[I wasn't sure about this move,

I thought I'd be right because of the 2 stones at C11 and K3

eek: Playing something in the top right quarter should be bigger, but for a move in bottom left, this is possible.]

(;B[nc]C[I'm pretty sure O17 was a big mistake, playing C8 would have been much better, I'm a right?

eek: C8 is interesting, because W's wall might become weak. But O17 is not a bad point.

Anyway, due to B's small mistakes, W is probably leading.];W[ck]
;B[ei]C[this move felt like I was giving white even more territory...

eek: W's territory isn't very big and you get sente, though.]
;W[ek];B[qg]C[i'm not sure about this move since Q9 is on the fourth line

eek: Seems ok.];W[qf];B[qd]C[perhaps R15 or Q14?

eek: Yes, either of those would be more normal, keeping the local advantage of first play and aiming to stay connected.]

(;B[kc]C[eek: Slack, better attack.];W[rh];B[qi];W[pm]
(;B[ql]C[eek: R7 isn't an important stone, better attack.];W[mo]

(;B[ri]C[eek: Wrong direction, he can't make two eyes here anyway.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[rc];W[nf]C[eek: Since he got to play first here, it is much harder to attack. B let a golden opportunity slip.]
;B[og];W[of]
(;B[nh]C[eek: Too slow.];W[lf];B[jo]C[I think I should have played something on the upper side by white's weak group but I didn't know what

eek: It isn't easy to gain much from that attack anymore, so it is reasonable to leave it for a while.]
;W[mc];B[mb]C[maybe n16?

eek: n18 seems ok.];W[lc];B[lb];W[nd];B[od];W[md]C[eek: W just lost sente and flexibility, 
no loss for B.];B[fm];W[dm];B[hm]C[eek: Since he answered, f7 becomes kikashi, and you can leave it. F14 looks like a good point.]
;W[nl];B[ib]C[eek: Very low- Better play L16 here.];W[kd]C[eek: As expected.]
;B[jc]TR[ib]C[eek: Now j18 is redundant.];W[ff];B[dg];W[ie]

;B[ji];W[gn];B[gm];W[bb];B[bc];W[dd];B[df]C[eek: B15 or c14 would of course give better protection against W's intrusion on the edge.

Anyway, the rest is endgame, so I take the liberty to skip it. Maybe the main point of the game is the weak W group on the right, which you could have gotten much more out of by attacking it better.

Good luck with your go!];W[ac];B[be];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bg]
