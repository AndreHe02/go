C[Hi

I'll preface my comments with "Nir:"

I've also commented some of the variations provided by your opponent. The biggest problem, as far as I can see, involves not reading deep  enough. This isn't really a criticism though, as I seem to have exactly the same problem at my level, and stronger players also complain about the same thing. The best solution to this is to do lots of life and death problems.

Another mistake that I saw (though more from W than B) is the "if I can atari, I must". Always think before atari-ing, its very often not the best move.

Finally, remember, you don't need to kill every group on the board, the killing of groups is incidental to the game of go. Its better to make profit by chasing a weak group than killing it outright and weakening yourself elsewhere. Also, its a game of give and take, if you make territory somewhere, be prepared to let your opponent also make some territory, just make sure the territory he makes is smaller than yours :)

If there is anything thats unclear in the review, please contact me.

Dewback [19k\]: yeah]
(;B[qf]
(;W[pc];B[ph]LB[pi:A]C[Nir: This is narrow, and leaves far too much space for an invasion (at Q9 for example), A is much better.]
;W[md];B[pl]C[Nir: If Q12 was at Q11, an invasion at Q10 would not be feasible. As things stand, white can still jump in there, and cause B a lot of headaches.]
;W[id];B[fc]C[Nir: B is being too passive with this invasion. D17 would be better. Always go for corner territory first, then sides, and then, when  nothing else is left, try make territory in the center.]
;W[dc];B[ic];W[hc]C[After the next fight, I end up with a tiny bit of territory and a small dangerous extention into my opponent's area.  I know this could have been better, but I an not sure what I should have done.

;W[ie];B[jb]
(;W[kc]C[Nir: This is a mistake for white, it saves an unimportant stone, but lets B make life. Trapping the H16 stone in a ladder with G16 is much better for W.]
;B[gc];W[he];B[gd];W[fe]C[Nir: At this stage, B is alive, but, as you said, only has a small territory on the top. B should move elsewhere (tenuki), e.g. K3 or C10. You may be disappointed with the amount of territory you made at the top, but, if you think about it, it was originally W's area, so any sort of profit you made there is just icing on the cake.]
;B[ha];W[je];B[ge];W[gf];B[ec]
(;W[ed];B[ff]LB[cj:A][dj:B]C[Nir: B should not have cut here. As you can see in the variation, all it does is help W build strength. A or B are much better for B to play if he wants to (later) threaten white. K3 and K4 are also very big points at the moment]

(;W[fg]C[Nir: This atari is from the wrong direction, E14 would have been betetr.]

(;W[oq]C[Nir: The variation is probably better for W];B[pq]
;W[nr];B[pr];W[jq];B[dn]C[Nir: Not a good move, B should try to make a bit of territory, something like H3 gives B a base, as well as threatenning to attack K3. Imagine what the board would look like if W had played at G3 next.]
;W[do];B[eo];W[co];B[cm]C[Nir: A very dangerous move for B, see variation]

(;B[fp]C[Dewback [19k\]: this move is pretty worthless I think

I was worried about a cut for my 3 stone group at E4.  It looked difficult to defend with out a big fight.

Nir: It would have been a tough fight (see variations), but it seems that B can survive. However, its sometimes better to be safe than sorry.]
;W[bi];B[cj];W[ej];B[fj];W[ek]C[Nir: Bad move for W. He cannot really save those two stones.]
;B[fk];W[bj];B[dk];W[hi];B[dg]C[Nir: B makes 1 point in sente. There are much much bigger moves on the board, e.g. H3, O5 and O14, so, while its not a bad move, the timing is wrong.]
;W[cg];B[hj];W[ki];B[ip]C[Nir: Would have been much better at H3, as W could not do what he does next.This may have cost B the game.]

;B[mh];W[lg];B[mj];W[kk]
(;B[jl]C[Nir: B's previous two moves indicate that he wanted to make territory on the left. This seems like a switch of tactics, it lets W jump into B's potential area. See variations. Note that M4 is still open to attack by B]
;W[lm];B[mm];W[ml]C[Nir: There is no reason for B not to cut here, as shown in the variations.This may have cost B the game.]
