C[If I were to give a single piece of advice, it would be to not underestimate the value of influence, and how reaching for the centre can disrupt this. When someone plays consistently on the fourth line, they are aiming for big influence, and you should counter it by never letting yourself get shut in, even if it means giving up territory.

White gets heavy influence early on, and then dominates the game from there, leaving you with little chance to win.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jd];W[pj];B[pe];W[qn];B[qh]C[This seems to me less than optimal an opening. The double-wing formation is strong, but not strong enough to take it while letting he opponent get one more stone in each of the other corners.

I would have suggested R15 instead of Q15, and then answering R6 on the other side.]
;W[np];B[qq]C[Here, your main aim should be to not get closed in. With white playing high (fourth line) consistently, you are very lacking in influence, and white shutting you in in the corner is really bad.]
;W[oq]C[A mistake by white to not play something like P5, to maximize the influence gained.]
;B[qo]C[This is not sufficient. White could here pull out with Q6 and all you would have accomplished is to strengthen his position.]
;W[pq]C[This does nothing for white, an end-game move.];B[qr]
;W[rp]C[Still nothing.];B[ro];W[rq];B[rr];W[rn]C[You can safely play Q6 here, a big move in that it presses white down on the right side, and gives you access to the centre.]
;B[sn];W[sm];B[so];W[po];B[pn];W[oo]
(;B[qp]LB[qm:B][qp:A]C[Saving the corner at this point is too little score, about 15-20 points, granting white extreme influence. Playing at R7 would salvage some influence, weakening Q10, with white taking gote if he takes the corner.]
;W[pm];B[qm]C[Too late for this now. S7 would be double-atari, but white would have no problem keeping you contained anyway.]
;W[rm];B[fq]C[White is strong on the right side of this; play away from strenghts (yes, even further than this - play c6 instead.)]
