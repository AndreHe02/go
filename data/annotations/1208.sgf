;B[cp]C[[Hi. This was a very interesting game to review. It's not played in my style at all, and I find it quite hard to understand up until the middle game. At the beginning of the game, there are many many unstable groups. This probably means that both players are playing too aggressively. Nevertheless, the beginning of the game contains many good moves by both players. By contrast, after the middle of the middle game, both players consistently take small points when there are much bigger ones available. Perhaps they lost concentration. This is a shame... you do all the hard work at the beginning, you should justify it by playing carefully afterwards. There are tactical mistakes later, which is a shame, but the main thing is that the players don't have a good view of the value of various moves later in the game. For this reason, I strongly recommend "Positional Judgement" as a book you should both read. It teaches largely through example. You learn
how to estimate during the game the value of pieces of territory and so judge which moves are most
important. Another good book is "Attack and Defense", which will teach you to think in terms of
groups. There are a lot of "inducing" and "thankyou" moves in this game, which "Attack and Defense"
would help you to see. I hope that you find my comments useful.

Hello! In the first place, thank you very much to the reviewer and the GTL.

This is a game I won by a very small difference, 3.5 points. I could very well lose it.

I believe I won because the opponent made more mistakes than I did, not because I
played better.

I think I had an advantage at a certain point (I'll show what I mean) and I misused it.  Did I really have that advantage? How badly did I misuse it?

I wrote lots of comments/questions; the GTL instructions said to review the game
myself. I guess this means more work for the true reviewer, as he/she has to
review my comments also.

Thank you again.];W[dd];B[pq]C[[I would prefer to play at Q4 here, since the natural follow-up of C4 is to complete
a shimari with E3. This results in a low stone on this lower side, so the move at
Q3 is too low.\]];W[pd];B[qg]C[
Is this move correct? Should it have been at R14?
I meant not to push too hard, so that I can later play R5 and have the
whole side for myself (after another stone around Q8-9).

[I haven't seen this approach move played before. I'm sure it is playable, but
R14 is more direct and more normal.\]];W[po];B[np]C[The lower side looks just as nice.

[Good, I think.\]];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[ql]C[Is this wrong?

[No, it looks good.\]];W[rr];B[ol]C[The game showed this tenuki was right. Was it really?

[Yes, it looks good. It strengthens the weakness between the stones on
R8 and R13.\]];W[pj]C[[This stone has nowhere to go already. White is giving himself a weakness
here, and encouraging black to strengthen his stone on R13, thereby  indirectly attacking white's corner.\]]
;B[qi]C[[I think it's better to jump out to P13. That would be strong attack on Q10,
and attack the top right corner. White doesn't have any eyes on this edge anyway - playing this move doesn't chnage that.\]]
;W[qj]C[[This is wrong. White just makes his group heavy. Instead, he should use the aji in this group by threatrening to connect to it. Perhaps play P14?\]]
;B[rj];W[rk];B[ri];W[pl]C[this a W mistake, right?

[Yes.\]];B[pk];W[pm];B[qk];W[qm]C[[White ensures he has two eyes in the corner.\]]
;B[oj];W[rl]C[[This is aji-keshi. White has no reason to force black to take off his
two stones.  Instead white should play somewhere more
constructive.\]];B[pi]C[now I think I have an advantage. My group surrounding Q10 look very strong to me.
W is very thin around that area. (I mean up and to the center).

[I agree.\]];W[mc]C[I think this is right, to reduce my advantage. Was E4 better, for instance?

[White's corner is feeling uncomfortable because of the strong black group on the right side. The question is, though, does this move effectively strengthen the corner? If not, what would, and if there is no move to strengthen the corner, what else should white do? Currently, the main priority for white should, I think, be to stop black from getting a double-wing formation (ie getting both the leftside and bottom edges). His options for doing this are either an extension along the left side, for example to C9, or an approach move against the lower left stone, for example with E4. Personally, I like the extension to C9, since it is at about the right distance from black's bottom left shimari to be awkward, and if black plays the approach move C14, white can pincer at C12. In short, I think that is a bigger move than N17.\]]
;B[cg]C[is this stone too far away from the Q10 strength? I don't really know how to play
by that proverb. Am I too greedy?

[It's the right direction. A better alternative would be to complete the shimari
with E3, which also stengthens black's claim over the lower side. Or how about
D14? Bearing in mind the potential shimari in the lower left corner, black should
be playing on the 4th line, not the third.\]];W[ep]C[[I think white has to do this now or he gets too far behind.\]]
;B[dq]TR[eq]C[now this move doesn't seem right. should I have played at say C-D7 or pincered around
H3-4? I'm weak in the lower-right corner so the pincer wouldn't be too good, right?

Anyway, D3 works bad with the influence of the Q10 group (at least I think so).

[I don't think D3 is so bad. It is a strong attack on E4, since it secures the corner strongly. The pincer looks very tempting though.\]

[White's next move (at triangle)) is too heavy. White is not going to make any territory here, whatever he does, so he should aim to make life and erase a lot of territory. D6 is lighter, forces black into a low position on the left side, and prepares white to then push out rightwards. Let's look at a variation.\]]

(;W[eq];B[dn];W[iq]C[W just got stronger :(

[True, but on the other hand, he has forced black to secure about as much of the bottom side as he could reasonably expect, and make a good claim on the left side too.\]]
;B[kq];W[kp];B[lq];W[fn]C[[Is this good? I don't know... In this region, which can either play this reducing move,
forcing blakc to strengthen his left side, or invade the left side. Actually, I prefer to
invade the left side with a pincer at C11. \]];B[ck]C[I believe I really should protect the side

[Yes, but why not instead make the solid extension to C10? if white then invades
at C8, he makes big problems for himself. Now white has the invasion at C11, which
is a much more constructive option.\]];W[ci];B[eg]C[[Good, this is the right direction of play.\]]
;W[ei]C[[This move is correct, I think. There are plenty of ways for this white group to connect
to something, yet it is quite light at the moment (therefore it can be given up and is not
a liability. It forces black to be careful to ensure the life of his two stones on C13, E13,
ie it limits black's options. It therefore strengthens white's top side.\]]
;B[cc]C[[This position is now very hard for me to judge. Actually, it is incredibly complicated. In playing
this move, black risks his two stones on C13, E13. If white can capture those, he gets
some territory (in compensation for what black takes away with the corner invasion),
he ensures that black's lower left side cannot grow. What else could black do? He could play
say F16 or F17. F16 looks good. \]];W[cd]C[is this a W mistake? he could have built a wall and then played around H-J3-4, isn't it?
he was willing to cut my C13 E13 stones away from the corner, right?

[I think this is good. White is now getting black to force him to attack the black stones
on C13, E13, something he wants to do anyway.\]];B[dc];W[ec]
;B[eb];W[fb]C[[Bad. If white follows this course of action, he must play at F17, then protect the cutting
point at E16 in order to make an effective attack on left side the black stones.\]]
;B[fc];W[ed];B[db];W[gc];B[fd];W[fe];B[gd];W[ge];B[hd];W[he]
;B[hc]TR[ef]C[[I never would have thought of this sequence at all, it's intriguing! But if white is going to do this (he is giving black a very strong corner group and losing a lot of territory on the top side, he must now use the wall he has developed, and defend the weakness on E15 by for example playing the triangled move.\]]
;W[jc]CR[hc][hd][gd][fd][fc][eb][db][dc][cc][mc][pd]C[[This isn't an attack on the marked black group, and it is a fairly small extension from the marked white group. \]]
;B[ee]C[this is too early and too aggressive, isn't it? But I don't see how I could have
prepared it better, and it looks appealing.

[This is very important. Now the white wall is cut in two and is weak. If white had strengthened it first, it would be strong. This is the correct move from black, I think. \]]
;W[ef];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[ff]C[[If black plays D13 here, instead of taking, can he kill white in the corner? I think he probably can (or at least make white live in gote.\]]
;W[bg]
(;B[gh];W[ie];B[je]C[[I don't see that this move does much, apart from forcing white to connect.\]]
;W[ch];B[jf]C[is it correct to ignore C12 here? I didn't see much choice though.

[It is probably correct to avoid responding directly, but black has to reinforce his D15 etc group somehow. The move you played seems to achieve this, but a better alternative is to play off G12 with G10, I think.\]]
;W[dg];B[ef];W[id];B[ic]C[[This move is horrible. It forces white to make a really solid connection.\]]
;W[jd];B[gb]C[[K18 is better.\]];W[re]C[[Nice one. This is quite a huge move.\]]
;B[pc]C[would R17 have been better? Anyway, did I have any chances of living there
or W made a mistake (or more)?

[I don't think this invasion should survive. Well, it's just on the edge.\]]
;W[qc];B[oc];W[od];B[qb];W[rb]C[[White likes to keep on cutting even when it doesn't work,\]]
;B[rc];W[qd];B[ra];W[pb];B[sb];W[ob];B[if]C[[What is this achieving? Whatever it is, it is too slow.\]]
;W[cl];B[cm]C[is this too defensive? I felt weak there.

[D8 looks better.\]];W[bl];B[bm];W[dl];B[ji]C[I had to try and connect, hadn't I?
Better ways?

[No, this is pretty good. You can think about trying to make some kind of
moyo in the centre. \]];W[ke];B[kf];W[le];B[lf];W[jn];B[kl]
;W[jl];B[ll];W[jk];B[kk]C[[Empty triangle... make the bamboo joint with L10 instead. Very solid connection and good shape.\]]
;W[em];B[er]C[[Whoever starts the endgame first, wins, as a shodan friend of mine says. Good.\]]
;W[fr];B[dr];W[fs];B[es]C[[No! This is too small, of course!\]]
;W[dp];B[co];W[jr]C[[That's bigger. There are even bigger moves aroud though. I think that playing around O14 or even O13
is what is important now. That central moyo is very big and needs to be trimmed.\]]
;B[kr];W[ks];B[ls];W[jq];B[gj]C[this feels urgent. ways to be more aggressive?

I guess consolidating white on the lower side of this territory was bad.

[This is a good erasing move but doesn't make any territory for black. How about O14 instead, which
makes bags of territory. \]];W[lp];B[mq];W[gl];B[fk]C[[White should probably ignore this and play O13 or O14.\]]
