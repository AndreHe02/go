C[Hi!  I am David, and I am playing White.  In this game, I had problems with the opponent's moyo.  I played some sequences wrong, and I had wrong timing somewhere.  Finally, I lost by 4.5 points.  Thank you for reviewing. ;)

-H-:  Hello, I am Svante, your reviewer.];B[pp];W[qd];B[dp]
;W[cd];B[jq];W[jd];B[jj];W[qn];B[pk]C[-H-:  Up to here, the formation is quite unusual, but I cannot say that either side has played clearly bad moves or gained any advantage.]
(;W[nn]C[David: My intent was good, but... you will see.

-H-:  I don't know about your intent, but I would rather play the simple one point jump.  There is no benefit here from going further.]
;B[nq];W[rp]C[-H-:  Now, what is this?  Black can simply cut through.]
(;B[pn]C[-H-:  I believe that Black should start with R5.];W[pm]
(;B[on]
(;W[ql]C[-H-:  P7 is the only move here.];B[om]C[-H-:  Now Black is happy, as all his stones work beautifully together.]
(;W[pl]C[-H-:  What is this supposed to do?  It only further strengthens Black, and White can't tenuki after Black answers.  White can tenuki now, as R3 and S10 are miai.]
;B[ol];W[qk];B[qo];W[ro]
(;B[cg]C[David: Now Black has a nice wall.

-H-:  Yes, and White built that wall with O6 and R8.  I think that Black should play Q10 here instead, which is "almost sente", as White will be hurt if Black is allowed to close at R10 (which would then be really sente).]
(;W[fp]C[David:  I thought that I must immediately stop Black from developing his moyo, before it becomes too big.

-H-:  How big is too big?  It might be easier to approach from the more open side at C6.  Don't forget that you also have some points and prospects.]
(;B[gq]C[-H-:  This can only be a bad move.  I really don't know what Black tries to do here.  The usual response would be to simply jump to D6.]
;W[fq];B[eo];W[fo];B[fn]C[-H-:  This looks like a 25 kyu's thoughts:  "Hey, I want to capture, so I take liberties".  White is quite happy.]
;W[dq];B[gn]
(;W[cp]C[-H-:  I think that White can even cut at E6 first (see variation).]
;B[co];W[ep];B[do]
(;W[hp]C[-H-:  This move doesn't threaten anything, it just reduces Black a little.  Protecting the corner would be bigger.]
;B[ed]C[David: Now I think that I look quite good, but Black is still probably ahead.]
;W[ee]
(;B[io]C[-H-:  This may look big, but it essentially builds territory directly in front of thickness.  Black should ask himself what White could actually achieve here, and it seems that White can just reduce the territory here a bit  Answering E15 is much more urgent.]
;W[fd]
(;B[pj]C[-H-:  Black should perhaps think about taking C3 now, if it is sente.]
(;W[bp]C[-H-:  I believe that White should answer on the right side.  Being enclosed in sente is not nice.]
;B[qj]
(;W[qq]C[-H-:  I think that protecting S6 would be better.]
;B[bo];W[ip];B[jp];W[ho];B[hn];W[jo]C[-H-:  This atari does not lead to useful continuations.  Most likely, White will want to have cut the other way, J6, instead, later.  I think White should leave this open---should Black protect here, it is a move White gains elsewhere.]
;B[in];W[fh];B[dj];W[fj];B[ek];W[jh];B[rn]
(;W[qm]C[David: I do not know why I played R7, stupid mistake.]
;B[rm]
(;W[pq];B[od];W[mc]
(;B[qe]C[-H-:  Black is building territory directly in front of his thickness again.  Allowing White to take the upper territory while connecting his stones is not a good deal.  See the variations for two alternative moves.

Exercise for the reader:  try to read out the implications, then look up the common josekis, and try to find out how best to modify them in this situation.]
;W[pd];B[pe];W[oc];B[oe];W[kj]C[David: Bad move.];B[ki];W[ji]
;B[jk];W[oq];B[op];W[nr];B[mq];W[nd];B[li];W[lg];B[fr];W[hr]
;B[ir];W[hq];B[cq];W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[ap];W[er];B[mg]C[David:  Here, I think that I must play E17.  It is fairly big, although maybe M14 or N14 are bigger.

-H-:  Not answering attachments is not a good idea in most cases.  Why not N14?]
(;W[lf];B[cc]
(;W[dd];B[eb];W[ec];B[bc];W[db];B[be]C[David:  Black could play better in the corner.]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[ch];B[dg]
(;W[di];B[ei];W[ej];B[ci]
(;W[fi]C[-H-:  I think that White can connect D12 (see variation).]

;B[lq];W[or]C[-H-:  I think this is a bit too small at this stage.  For one, L2 is smaller than C18 or O11, but Black can also still capture L2 when he gets J1 after hane and connect on the left (retreating to G2 is a different way to lose a point for White).]
;B[jr];W[ni]C[-H-:  So, you didn't want to protect L2 anyway.  What is P2 there for now?]
;B[oj];W[nj];B[nk];W[sn];B[rl];W[sm]C[-H-:  White should play R4 first.]
;B[rk];W[gi]C[David: Too small.

-H-:  C18 is quite big.];B[bd]C[-H-:  C18 would be bigger.]

[po][bp][cp][kp][mp][np]C[David: Ah, this deceptive komi. ;)

-H-:  White's big mistakes were the thin jump at O6 in the beginning, not protecting the lower left corner after C4, and the needless loss after R10 on the right side.  Black counteracted this with his tendency to build territory directly in front of his own thickness, allowing White to gain huge points on the top side.]
