C[Daniel: Hello, thanks for letting me review your game.  I'll be prefixing my comments with "Daniel:" as with this one.]
;B[qc];W[dp];B[po];W[dd];B[fc]SQ[od][pe]MA[pq]C[My plan with this fuseki was to eventually play one of the marked enclosures, depending on what happened.

Daniel:  Okay, that's reasonable.  It's not at all a common fuseki, but I can't find anything terribly wrong with it.  I'd probably personally be in a bigger hurry to enclose at Q3 because the 3-3 stone is so secure and territorial, but I don't think I can say that's definitely better than your plan.]
;W[pq]
(;B[np]C[Daniel: The right side isn't super developable because of the 3-3 stone.  This move is fine, but I'd be more inclined to take territory in this situation with R3.]
;W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[rn];W[pf]SQ[ph][nr]C[Here I was deciding between sealing white in the corner, and responding to this stone, probably with a pincer.

I wasn't expecting a distant approach to my 3-3 stone, so I sort of abandoned my original thinking.

Daniel: I agree with your move of O2.  The more distant approach is less urgent, and W may die in the corner after B follows up.]
;B[nr];W[ro]SQ[pn]C[I believe this move makes the cut more severe, but I decided not to fix it yet, since I was hoping I'd be okay in a fight.

Daniel: I think the cut is a huge problem and B has to respond in some way.  That doesn't need to be to fix directly though.  The pincer provides support in a fight later and is probably sufficient.  I'd probably fix directly because not to leaves a lot of aji for later.  The pincer isn't very urgent.]
;B[ph];W[hc]C[At this point things were just getting too complicated for me.]

(;B[fe]C[Daniel: I think B should just jump into the corner (see variations).  W's wall will not be useful enough compared to B's territory regardless of which way W makes it.  This move is only good when B needs to avoid giving W the wall, otherwise the lost territory is too costly.]
;W[df];B[id];W[ic];B[jd];W[hd];B[he];W[jc];B[kd];W[nf]TR[hc]
[hd][ic][jc][pf]C[I didn't know what to do to this move. I wasn't in love with any of my local responses, so I decided to do something else.

Daniel: That's often good logic.  In this case, W has two weak groups (marked), so B should play between them.  Maybe at O16]

(;B[fb]SQ[ia][db]C[In hindsight, this move was smaller than I thought. I thought it would make the two marked points miai, but after white strengthens the group on the top, the D18 point is pretty small compensation. As it happened, white let the J17 group die for some silly reason, but I don't think this move should've got me what it did.

Daniel:  J19 is small if W defens the corner.  L17 is a better local followup, which probably kills.  And yes, D18 is small.  Better to just play L17 directly.]
;W[kc];B[ld];W[mb];B[nd];W[mg]
(;B[db]SQ[nf][pf][mg]C[Taking my profit, but I think I needed to harass the marked stones instead...

Daniel:  Yes.  Definitely.  Also, you can jump all the way into the corner for profit in sente if W responds.]
;W[oh];B[pi];W[oi]
(;B[pj];W[nk]
(;B[qf];W[qe];B[qg];W[ci]C[I'm not sure how I feel about this move.

Daniel:  Seems small to me.];B[fq]C[Daniel: Good.  P8 still may be bigger.]
;W[pe];B[oc]C[Here I was afraid of white's thickness, and I knew I needed to secure this base/connection.]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[eq];B[fp];W[cc]
(;B[cb]TR[id][jd][kd][ld][he]C[Daniel: This is too small at this point.  B has bigger moves to play.]
;W[er];B[fr]C[Daniel: Not as big as fixing the cut.];W[or]C[Daniel: Too bad you didn't get the sente against the corner first.]
;B[nq];W[en]SQ[ie][pn]C[I don't think that was the biggest point for white. I still had these marked cuts to worry about.

Daniel:  I agree.  That said, this move gives W a ton of potential that B should consider breaking up immediately.]
;B[ek]C[But I decided to toss this stone in anyhow, mostly to see what white would do.]
;W[ck];B[ei]C[And I'm happy with what I got.

Daniel:  Yeah, super passive response by W, good exchange.  Would be much better if sente.]
;W[ll]C[Daniel: Now W is strengthening this group though...]
;B[pn];W[ol];B[pl];W[bb]C[Now I'm wondering why white is playing endgame moves in the middle of a struggle in the center.

Daniel: W is mostly safe after M8.  Very hard to attack W in the center now.  This does seem smaller than the cut at J15.]

(;B[if];W[re];B[rf];W[ln];B[km]C[I mostly just wanted to get a stone near the middle of the board in sente.]
;W[mn]
(;B[nn];W[jk];B[lm]C[In hindsight, I really don't like this move.

Daniel: I agree.  Treat forcing moves lightly, don't make the forcing stone heavy.  M4 is still big.]
;W[mm];B[kl]C[I don't like this one either.

Daniel:  Not great shape.];W[kk];B[kh];W[jn]C[And I shouldn't have missed that net. I was just really eager to play a reducing move after giving white that thickness for whatever reason.

Daniel: Yeah...];B[lk]C[Daniel: Not much of a point in cutting when the other stones are dead]
;W[ml]
(;B[mj];W[oj];B[mi];W[kp];B[kq];W[lp];B[lq];W[gn];B[il]C[Once again, trying to get a stone in that area in sente.]
;W[jl]
(;B[gl]C[Daniel: J8 was fine, but once you've got it, if you defend it, it was no longer sente.  This move doesn't really make any points.  Better to defend your territory with H4.  Or play sente endgame elsewhere.  Q4 looks sente for example.]
;W[ho]
(;B[hq]C[Daniel:  Too passive.];W[dg]
(;B[fg]C[Daniel:  This isn't as big as it looks, because W is alive at K9 and can destroy almost all the territory there.  Better to play Q4.]
;W[ik]SQ[jk][kk][jl]C[From this point forward I play very territorially because I'm afraid of how much white can reduce me with the marked stones.

Daniel: Yeah, there was never much there to begin with, because of those stones.]

(;B[ki];W[lj];B[gk];W[kg];B[lf];W[lg];B[jg];W[hl];B[ia]C[I intended this as a reduction move, but after a comedy of errors it ended up killing the white group.]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[nc];B[od];W[na];B[mc];W[lc];B[nb];W[ma]C[Did I scare the machine?]
;B[oa];W[ka];B[ja]C[Later in the game I saw the following sequence, starting at H18...

But I got H19 in before white could catch me.]

;W[es];B[gr];W[sb];B[rb];W[kf]C[I thought this was kind of baffling. It's as if GNU go recognizes that the monkey jump exists, but doesn't know how it actually works.]
;B[rd]C[I play here because I'm confident I can win any ko.]
;W[ba];B[le];W[dl];B[el];W[dc];B[ha]C[This is the point where I see that sequence from before.]
;W[mo];B[no];W[om];B[ec];W[da];B[ea];W[ca];B[eb]C[Daniel:  Saving these two stones isn't very big, because B can just retake one if W takes.]
;W[os];B[ns];W[oq]C[I don't know why white gave up sente here. As far as I can see, this move is worth one point, but there are plenty of sente moves worth that much...

Daniel:  I agree with you that W had better moves, however, this move is a little better than just one point in gote.  Note that If B played there, it would be sente for B, so it's actually one point in reverse sente.]
;B[eo];W[do];B[hp];W[fo];B[ep];W[io];B[em];W[dm];B[dh];W[ch]
;B[gq]C[My aim with this move was to start a ko for white's connection. I didn't realize white would immediately play F6 after I tried to start it.

Also, I doubt that connection was worth anything.

Daniel:  Yeah, this is just costing you a point, playing a stone in what could be your own territory (compare B G4)]

White wins by 10.5.

Daniel:  Thanks for letting me review your game.  I think the biggest thing you can do to focus more in keeping sente.  It was most noticable in the endgame, but also present throughout.  Make sure you're always asking if you're playing the biggest move on the board, and look for sente sequences that you can play.  Remember that if you play something in "sente" and then have to respond to your opponent's response, it's not actually sente, so you need to do a few moves of reading to determine whether a move is really sente sometimes.  Good luck!]
