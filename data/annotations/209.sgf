(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[General comment: I have only reviewed  the first 90 moves in any detail. After that there are only sporadic comments.
Most of the comments are about strategic issues, and less about tactical  errors (reading errors, life&death sitiuations, connecting groups and so  on), of which there are plenty on both sides. In particular, both players  tend to play on already dead groups. White has a tendency to "tenuki" (play  elsewhere), leaving weak and unsettled positions behind.]

[Reviewed by Per-Erik Martin.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[ep]C[This can be a good opening  (it's not seen very often in kyu-amateur games). A good followup is C4,  creating a strong position in the corner. Of course, Black can invade ad C3  or C4 as well to prevent this.]
;B[fc]M[cf][df]C[This move is usually not  ignored (even if that is a possible alternative). The simplest reply by  White would one of the marked spots (D14 or C14).]
;W[pg];B[nc];W[mc]M[cf][df][qk][cp][qj][cq][cg]C[In general,  contact moves like this are not called for in this situation. It doesn't  attack the black stones,  and it is not helping the Q13 st

one.
As the board stands, more urgent moves are extending from D16 (see earlier  comment),  strengthening the Q13 stone, for instance with R9, or take the C4  point in the lower left corner.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[nf];W[oo]M[qn][nq]C[This move is unorthodox. A night's move from either side is  more common. Invading on the 3-3 (R3) point is possible (in general, but  it's too early here).
It is also a bit strange to leap from one unsettled situation to another,  abandoning the N16 stones, and the Q13 stone.]
;B[qn]C[Simply extending to Q5 is more solid.];W[ql]C[This is ok, if maybe  a bit far from the Q13 stone. Strengthening P5 is also an option (with P4  for instance).]
;B[pm];W[ol]M[pl]C[This leaves a hole for  Black to push through. Simply Q8 is better.]
;B[pl];W[om];B[qk];W[me];B[ic];W[kp]C[This is good.  Extending from both the corner and the (somewhat thin) White wall.]

(;B[hp]C[Black invades to keep White from getting too much territory along  the lower side. The black stone is however sitting between the white stones  with no base, so I think White should answer this. (See variation for  possible continuations.)]
;W[ne];B[oe];W[of]C[A  perhaps questionable cut since Black can split White in two. On the other  hand, not cutting doesn't seem very fun either...]

However, White can capture the three black stones with N12 instead. (See  variation of this move.)]
