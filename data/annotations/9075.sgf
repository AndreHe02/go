C[Dear reviewer,

I play white in this game. I end up losing by 10 points in the end and I've been looking over this game, and have not been able to find my critical mistakes or many better alternatives to moves I played. I'd be greatful for any insight you could provide about the opening and any other moves I should consider when the board is still quite open. I personally dislike playing san-ren-sei and I would love any tips on how to improve my play against it.

I've put in a few more specific questions further into the game record.

Thanks in advance,

Greg

Dear Greg,

I think there are some simple usual mistakes you're making strategically. To summarize, they are:

1. Not following a Four Questions approach:
- where am I strong
- where am I weak
- where is the opponent strong
- where is the opponent weak
Then playing away from strength and playing closer to weakness

2: sacrificing has become to facile for you.  Sacrifice when you must, not when you can.  

3: playing heavy in enemy territory (probably why San-ren-sei bothers you)

See the game record for my comments marked WOG:

Thanks for sharing your Go!];B[dp]C[gillessed [2d\]: hi gg

WOG: excellent.  Some chatter is good manners];W[pp];B[dd]
(;W[pc]C[WOG: if you absolutely despise San-ren-sei you can consider another move.]
;B[dj]
(;W[fc]C[Is 6 the same as approaching below? 

WOG: Not for me.  I don't like two low stones on the third line. Prefer to approach on the third line from your star stone.]
;B[id];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[gc];B[ge];W[fq];B[ip]TR[cn]
[dn]SQ[cq]C[I don't really like giving black both walls so I didn't enter the corner at C3, but instead played at D6. Is D5 or D6 better here? Or are both considered bad?

WOG: two corners white, black middle, is fine.  The game becomes reducing Black's moyo.  

Going up is fine.  Countering is fine.  Too many ways of go.  Who knows best? Above me.]

;B[do];W[cr];B[bq]C[I would love a second opinion on the following moves. B3 took me a little by surprise. Was G5 a good follow-up? Is there anything else I could try here?

;B[fn]C[I'm thinking now that B2 might not be necessary to live? Is this the correct judgement? Is it still the right move to play in terms of territory?

WOG: can't blame having to save in the corner on this turn.  Problem starts with the previous move and elsewhere first.  If you don't play here and do live, Black gets two sente walls and giant points.  Good to play a at this stage.]
;W[br]C[Still have to save here

WOG: yes!]
(;B[fm]C[WOG: Too close to Black's strength.  Bad.];W[in];B[nq]

(;W[lq]C[I was a little uneasy about this invasion but I felt his extension was a little far, and Q6 or R6 were too slack.

WOG: violates the Four Questions rule. Where am I/opponent strong/weak; stay away from strength; stay closer to weakness.  Here the weak white stones are in the middle and/or the corner.  Black has two stones now helped by one; not so weak.  

Playing in the midst of Black raises a third weak White group.  Instead find a move that addresses a weakness by playing closer to it, and keeps away from strength by playing farther from it.  

Moreover, try to play a move that addresses not just these meanings but also other rules of thumb; here, don't owe your opponent multiple things. By introducing a third white group you've essentially moved an extra debt onto the board amidst black.]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[kq]
(;W[mp];B[lo];W[mq];B[ko]C[Looking back, P3 next seems kind of bad. I was trying to be cute and capture both the side and the corner, but the shape seems so weak. Would O4 be better instead?

WOG: tenuki is also possible. A is cleaner than a.  a is fraught with aji for the four]

WOG: yup]
(;W[gl]C[WOG: Too obvious the next move and you're too concerned with three stones that don't do anything.  They're between two living  black groups and now you've made a real investment that's heavy. You're playing too heavy amidst black.]
