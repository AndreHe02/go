AB[pd][dp]C[Selcouth [10k\]: hi hf

Hey Selcouth, my name is Zero Wave and I'm 1 dan egf european. I'll be reviewing your game. Don't tkae my comments as too harsh - I'll be pointing out everything I see, and a lot of it is okay at your level. Fell free to contact me for any questions at grmdra12@gmail.com!]

(;B[jd]LB[hc:B][ic:C][rg:D][rh:E][dm:A]C[ZW: D7 is very big; tenuki doesn't fell so right here...  A is very important for both sides. Also, this move is sadly a mistake. We shoulder hit when we want to reduce a moyo or a lot of influence. here' we can simply invade at B/C. Also, the Triangle group isn't alive yet - invading denies the group eyes, which is very important.
Another Point of Interest is the square group. you can unleash an extreme atack easily - and it's very urgent for the white group. The proverb says "Urgent before big"; so A, D or E are biggest here.]

(;B[jg]LB[fe:B][mi:A]C[ZW: Sadly, this move doesn't acomplish anything :( if you want to get influence at the center, A or B is better. If you're afraid of the cut, see variation]

(;B[ho]LB[in:A]C[ZW: Not a good move :( if you want the center influence, A is better. But there's something more interesting here...]
;W[ip];B[ic]C[ZW: a small endgame move; Don't waste ko threats :(]
;W[ib];B[bf]LB[no:A]TR[pe][pf][qf][oi][qi]SQ[bj][bk][bl][cl]
[dm][cn]C[ZW: also very small. You don't gain points on the side if W plays there and lives (B6 for example); and the followup at the corner is still small. Atacking the triangle group is much bigger, and A is a bigger endgame move. Better to kill the square group now, and atack the triangle group after that. This move is about a 100 moves too early.]
;W[in];B[hl]LB[il:A]C[ZW: A better here.];W[ef]
(;B[ee]C[ZW: Good heart, but this is the wrong place for Kiai. you should use the stone to block off the center (see variation)]

;B[aq];W[ao]C[ZW: Overall you're a fine player. You're endgame is probably your weakest point, so you should work some more on it. The main point of study I'd suggest is shapes - look up some high dan games and just see the shapes they play, and study the good shapes At Sensei's Library. Don't take my comments to hard - I pinpointed everything, but most of the moves are fine for your current level. Your fuseki Is very good for your level.
Good luck!])
