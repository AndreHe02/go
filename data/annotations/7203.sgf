AB[dp][pd]C[Chris: Hi my name is Chris. I hope I can help with your questions.]

(;B[gd]C[maybe black shouldn't be contacting here.
Chris: Yes helping white make points.];W[fc];B[fd];W[ed]C[also another bad exchange for black]
;B[ef]LB[gf:A][ig:B]C[Chris: This shape is funny. A is the vital point. Maybe even right now White can play an asking move (yosu miru) to see how to continue attacking Black. Black should have played there instead, or even tenuki while B is still a possibility.]
;W[qj]
(;B[pi]C[Chris: Not so good. Better close the "skirt". A shoulderhit is considered a touching move, making both sides strong. White is weak, black is strong at the top right already, so better hold back a little.]

Chris: Yes clearly wrong side. Black is strong now at the top and centre, so he should push white towards it.]

[ee:C][ce:D]C[Chris: The last few moves give white plenty of moderate size ko threats, 8 more points, and with the sequence ABC, white can still break in or capture the 3 stones. Black should have stopped at D and keep these exchanges in reserve.]

(;B[fm]C[this must be wrong.];W[eq];B[ep];W[fq];B[gq];W[gr]

(;B[hr]LB[fm:A]C[is this double hane correct?
Chris: here I dont like the double hane. the outside is much bigger than the corner at the moment. With A black committed even more to taking the outside. Whites invasion at that particular point is an overplay. Making white live on the second line is very painful.]
;W[hq];B[gp];W[ir];B[fr];W[hs];B[er];W[cq];B[dq];W[bo];B[cp]
;W[bp];B[bq]C[Chris: Black got quite little corner terretory, considering the amount of stones invested, while white got this sente reduction AND a ponnuki on the outside. this result is much better for white.]

;W[lf]TR[oo][pm][pp][qp]C[is it already to late to save black's triangle stones?
Chris: I believe yes. The game is pretty much over. I count W+20 (about). This is the last comment.

In general, it seems like you get sucked into local fights, forgetting the wholeboard situation. Exchanges like the bottom left should end up bad for white, yet white got sente a position on the outside and the reduction into the corner in sente! A little further to the right it looks like you missjudged the strength of your stones a little. Maybe tsumego (especially shape problems) could help. I hope I could be of help. Enjoy the game!]
