Hello. Thank you for the review in advance!

FIrst, this is my first time using this review service so i am sorry if i got the formatting wrong. i had trouble figuring out how to edit the comment section on CGoban3. but i figured out that you have to view in offline mode under options.

This is a 15k level game. I am probably more close to 18-20k however.
Thus, I wont go to deep in asking problems regarding Joseki and L&D since i probably wont understand them.

NOTE: This is my main question for this game. which i will point out as the game goes on
I play white. ignore the fact that i won. i only won because of fluke in the end when enemy got really greedy and tried to do some stuff in the middle. i was confused. maybe he saw something i didnt? (or atleast thought he saw something?)


my question is towards the later half of middle game. i have two question. and this is ALWAYS the case for me.

    1) i keep a good middle but it gets reduced to half later on. how do i stop this from happening?
    2) opponent always manages to end up with a huge side corner. how do i stop this from happening?

at first i was okay with problem 2 because i had huge middle. then it got reduced to half. i knew I was losing now so i just did a kamikaze invade on the right side with N6 and invite cute at M6. which he did.

i reduced. but not as much as i planned to. (and I think the reduce was only successful because opponent misplayed with black R4. right?)

so now. question 3, which is more specific is, how could i have more effectively reduced that portion?

and now side questions regarding question 3

im guessing i should've invaded that area LONG time ago. if so, when/how? and since thats to late now, how should i have correctly invaded at that time when i did go for the nvade

thank you

game is 25 min main time and 30sec x5 byoyomi.
I play as white.

Heidn : Hi. I am not sure i have got all you points here in this questions. But I'll keep this in mind during the review.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
(;W[dc]LB[di:A]C[First question actually. I was wondering on this move. I remember reading about whats the correct way to open here.

is this correct? or is variation correct?

reason why i ask is because i remember reading something about what direction to face.

H: Here are a lots of playeble options, it is almost impossible to judge something right or wrong here. 
If you add A it will be chinese fuseki, and it is played by professionals.]

thre are no so much preasure on A to defend.

(;W[cf]C[It is considered a little bit greedy.

(;B[dq];W[eq];B[ep]C[Was thinking he would go with the standard 3-3 invasion. I was wrong.

Threw me off so i had to rethink. and i came up with................. (next  move)

H: yes, it looks like overplay.
black coner is going to die now.]
(;W[eo]C[This.

Here my goal was to sacrifice E3 stone to get a better left side group going with my next move.

And i think my plan worked??

H: I do not think this plan is good.];B[fp];W[el]C[As you did not preasure coner, black can profit i think.]

When he went inside my stones at D8, i didnt think he would do that.

Is there a way black could have lived? and what is the correct response to my move at E8?

H: there are many options, see variations.];B[an];W[cn];B[bp]
;W[bl];B[am]C[You can kill]
(;W[fo]C[Here I start to realize i think to reduce the bottom or the right side.

H: You can do it instead of this move. 
This move is actually vary slow. Almost useless.];B[hq]
(;W[jq];B[lq];W[jo];B[ho]C[40-43 is good for black. white got a weak group and black builds up territory.]
;W[jm];B[lo];W[lm]LB[jq:A]C[Here i think that i reduced bottom decently??

And then i see whole right side beign black so i decided to push in

H: better you do it instead of A]
(;B[mm]C[Bad for black.]
(;W[ml];B[nm];W[nl]C[But even though that was my plan to push in, this kind of stuff ALWAYS heppens to me. as i noted at the start.

my opponents always get a big side area.

But later you see that it gets reduced by a lot and i have no idea how it even happened or how to stop it

(;W[gi]C[With G11 not sure if i had the right idea.

I thought about either G10,11, or 12.

But no matter how i saw it, it seems like if i went either G10 or G12, black could keep pushing inside the middle.

so with the G11, I thought it was miai? if he goes G10, I go with the variation you see in game.

and if he went G12, I just go G10 and keep middle??

H: Never touch something you going to attack.
Attack from far, defend close.]
(;B[gj];W[gh];B[gg];W[gf]C[I thought this move would let me either keep the middle, or capture F15 group.

Thought he would extend at H13. but i think White G14 was a mistake now that im going over it.

playing it out in the variation that I invisioned, it ended up dead.]

Here, I start to see that my middle is basically half of what it was. and Black has whole bottom and right side.

;B[mo]LB[pg:F][pi:B][pk:A][om:C][nn:D][qo:E]C[Planing an attack you are to consder all weaknesss. 
I'd say black have A-E. Try not to push any specfic weakness drectly, but threat to activate more then one by one move.]

(;W[mn]C[Which is why here i do a kamakazie invade attempt.

My goal is to invite the cut at M6, atari with O6 to push out and make eyes.

I'd seek some other way.];B[ln];W[nn];B[om];W[po];B[oo];W[pn]
