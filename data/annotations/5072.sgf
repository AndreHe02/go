AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

This is a 2-stone handicap game I played on IGS.
I was black, rated 23 kyu;
my opponent was rated above 22 kyu.

First of all thanks for taking the time to review this game.
What I'm hoping to get from this review, is where my weaknesses lie. So more in general terms.
Throughout the game I will comment what I was thinking,
and I will ask some questions, where i have doubts.];W[pp]C[Mattias> Hi, I will now do your review. Hope you'll enjoy the ride!  :o)]
;B[dd];W[qj];B[dj]C[Here I though about Q12; would that have been better or worse than what I played?

Mattias> I would say that your move at D12 is better. Your stones occupy a larger area like this. That will make it harder for the opponent.]
;W[jq];B[hq]C[Seemed good because I block and at the same time use my stone on D4.

Mattias> It is ok.];W[mp];B[qf]C[Making a shimari, and blocking the double space extension at the same time.]
;W[jc]C[Mattias> And then you must expect an answer like this. Then you need to know what answer you have for this. Se variation.]

(;B[hc];W[nc];B[lc]C[I guess this wasn't a good move, I just got me in trouble, losing 3 stones in the end.]
;W[ld];B[mc];W[md];B[kc];W[kd]
(;B[jd]C[In the following sequence of moves, I tried to attack, and at the same time enforce one of the upper corners.]

;W[jd];B[kf];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[qc];B[qd];W[rc]
(;B[pm]LB[io:a][qq:b]C[This move seemed good to me.
I this the biggest play, or should I play elsewhere?

Mattias> Oh, thats hard to say. I would not have thougth of playing
at that perticulat spot. I would have played at 'a' or 'b'. The play 
at 'a' expands my moyo and 'b' takes away whites corner.];W[nm]
;B[qo];W[qp]
(;B[ol]LB[ql:a][ok:b][pj:c]C[Trying to get access to the center.
I this the best move in such a situation?

Mattias> It depends on the situation. Sometimes it is better to build
a base for eyes first and then run for the center. Sometimes you
must run directly. In this situation I would build a base first with 
a move at 'a'. Then I aim for 'b' or 'c'.];W[nk];B[nl];W[ml]
;B[ok];W[nj];B[oj]C[Linking up with my stones above.];W[om]
;B[pn];W[pl]C[This looks like an overplay to me. So I'm gonna try to punish it.]
;B[ql];W[pk];B[pj];W[qk];B[rl];W[oi];B[pi];W[qi];B[ph];W[qh]
;B[qg];W[sg];B[rh]C[Separating the White stones and further weakening the Q11-group.]
;W[ri];B[rg];W[ni];B[si];W[io];B[fp]C[Defending my H3-stone, and strenthening my corner.]
;W[cm];B[em]C[Here I put pressure on the C7 stone.
I this the right plan, or should I rather block at C6/C8?

Mattias> I would have played C5 because I don't believe 
that I can kill the white stone. Then it's better to let it run 
and save the territory I have.];W[cg];B[ce];W[cj];B[ci]C[Trying to separate the groups; it will cost me a stone though; are there better moves here?

Mattias> It is ok. Don't bother to lose stones if you can earn/save more.]
;W[di];B[ck];W[bj];B[dk]C[Ok, stone at C7 is cut off now.];W[bi]
;B[bk];W[ei];B[fd]C[Since corner probably won't get access to the center anymore, I am securing it.

Mattias> If you want to secure you must play F17.]
(;W[ff];B[fj]C[I am trying to take a large space in the lower left corner.

Mattias> You are a bit to shy if you want to take a large space.
You can play one step to the right. But still, the corner is not
secure. White can still do an 3-3 invasion. If you want to keep
the corner YOU must play in the corner. C3 or C4.];W[fi];B[ej]
;W[se];B[rd];W[sd];B[rf];W[sf];B[sh];W[ng];B[re]TR[qd][rd][qf]
[rf]C[Mattias> This move is not necessary. The marked stones form a
bamboo-joint wich can not be broken. The only thing you do is to
force white to connect... and that is something he will do later anyway.]
;W[sc];B[nh]C[Mattias> Did you notice... (variation)]
(;W[mh];B[oh];W[mg];B[pg];W[nf];B[lf];W[of];B[rj]C[After the game I saw this made no sense at all.
I had better saved group at K14, but in the game I didn't even they were under direct attack.

Mattias> Yes, there is no rush in killing the group. White had 2 liberties
and you got 6 liberties.];W[jg];B[mk]C[Winning some stones here.]

C[Trying here to prevent White making big territory in upper left corner.

Mattias> Yes, White made a too big jump.];W[af];B[bg]C[His two stones are dead now, because he can't link them up, otherwise I will save stone at C12.]
;W[ag];B[bh];W[ch];B[ah];W[be]C[Clearly a blunder of my opponent,]
;B[ci];W[cf];B[df];W[cd];B[de];W[cc]C[I guess my opponent was trying to make live in the corner, and sacraficing his croup at C13.]
;B[bd]C[Separating him, both of his groups should be dead now.]

jumping further in to your territory. Se variation.];W[hd];B[dh]

(;B[bp]C[I don't know whether this was the right move, what do you think here?

for white. Se variation on how you should play.];W[cq];B[bn]

But later when liberties are fewer it is dangerous. See variation.]

played pretty much the same way.];W[kn];B[mo];W[lo];B[ip];W[jp]

C[Mattias> This is more worth than whites two-stone-capture (4p).]
;W[qq];B[rr];W[qr];B[po]C[Mattias> One-point-move. R1 had been better (6p).]
;W[rs];B[sr];W[qs];B[hp]C[Mattias> Zero-point-move. You don't want to do this kind of moves until
the very end or in a ko-fight. But maybe you are running out of time and
don't have time to look enough at the board.];W[jo];B[pf];W[oe]
