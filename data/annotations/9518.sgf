C[Hi, I am TheIdiot, playing black.
Thank you very much for reviewing my game.
I played go before and I started to play again around 2 weeks ago.

Forfun (hereafter ff) - First of all thanks for a good fighting game to analyze. It was interesting to go through. Let's see if we can learn something from what took place.

Clearly in this game White was a little sharper than Black tactically. This may have just been because Black hasn't been playing recently. A little more practice can help scrape off the rust on Black's game.

More importantly, however, I think that Black has to work on a tendency to 'think small'. Right at the beginning of the game Black made an excellent decision in the upper right that resulted in a ponnuki shape that radiated power across the board. But too often after that Black was thinking and planning details when the position called for again considering the big picture. 

In addition, Black needs to build (rebuild?) more of a killer instinct. At no point in the game does Black set out to deliberately kill some White stones. Of course too many of us amateurs suffer from the opposite problem of trying to capture something too often. However, I had the feeling that Black is currently not seeing enough of the opportunities that lie in any position. We will see what I mean when we get down to details...]

LB[qe:A]TR[la][lb][lc][ld][le][lf][lg][lh][mh][nh][oh][ph][qh]
[rh][sh]C[Here I didn't know the joseki..
Maybe in A is better ?

ff - If I draw a boundary around the corner including the N13 point (in other words the corner space inside the triagles), my database of about 87,000 pro games gives us 746 examples of the five stones in the corner. There are 432 games where Black plays Q17 next, 305 games where Black plays at 'A', and exactly 1 game where Black plays R16 (Yang Yi 5d - Wang Yang 5d, 2002 Chinese Cities League, 2002-11-14). Indeed S17 (Ch'oe Kyu-pyeong 6d - Cheong Su-hyeon 7d, 2nd SBS Cup, 1993-10-28) happens as often as Black R16! :-)

If instead we search on this exact whole-board position, we find five games played between 2008 and 2013. In all five cases Black continues with Q16. I think that pros consider it a little slack to even play A when Black has a small-knight shimari in the lower right corner and the low pincer at R11. Black ends up with a low position. White will have too many opportunities to reduce the right side later. In this corner position with the 2-space high pincer at Q11 instead of R11 Black is more likely to play A than Q17, although pros play both.]

(;B[qd];W[pc];B[od]C[ff - Of course Black is making a bad shape by running head on into the White stone...]
;W[oc];B[ne]
(;W[rd]C[ff - White's direction of play is off here. Even though this is a shape point, the upper side is more important.]
;B[re];W[rc];B[md]LB[qe:A]C[I thought that a ponnuki and the sente was better than defending in A and if I did my stones would be overconcentrated I think.

ff - Good thinking. However, it is naive (even though correct!) to expect White to ignore the atari. So what did you plan to play next if White connected?]

(;W[qe];B[nc];W[rg]
(;B[de]LB[ec:4][cd:3][dd:2][ce:1]C[I wanted him to play this joseki to use my influence in order to build territory on the top

ff - Again it is naive (and in this case incorrect) to expect White to cooperate. The fundamental question is how to use Black's strength. Takemiya might what to enclose the center. But more ordinary mortals will prefer to think that we use the power of the ponuki by approaching the upper left low rather than high.]
;W[fc]C[ff - White wants to erase the potential from Black's ponnuki but Black is not upset since White's resulting position is low...]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[ci]C[ff - Black has started well IMHO.]

(;W[rp]C[This move suprised me.

ff - This is interesting timing in order to decide how to handle the right side. There are actually a couple of pro games where White plays this attachment before deciding how to answer the original 2-space pincer at R11. By now the upper right has been played out. Here it is not so clear that Black wants to encourage White to invade the right side. The R11 stone can end up weak. Basically replying to S4 with the inside hane at S3 does exactly that. It leaves most of the potential for White facing up the side. The main alternative would be to answer at R5, emphasizing the outside rather than the corner. See the variation...]

(;B[rq];W[pp];B[qq]
(;W[jp]C[ff - This looks like an overplay. There is real danger that the stones played in the corner will be lost for little or no compensation.]
;B[lp];W[qk]
(;B[ph]C[ff - Black has been fooled into thinking that the upper right is important. It has already been largly settled]
;W[pn]C[ff - The earlier probes start to come alive now.]
(;B[po]C[ff - This seems too narrow in its ambition. It also helps White make shape. Black needs to play on a larger scale.]
;W[oo];B[qo];W[on]
(;B[op]C[ff - Again this is thinking on a small scale.];W[oj]

(;B[qm]C[ff - This is the wrong direction now. White is not going to make shape along the edge anyway]
;W[ln]C[ff - This result is too good for White.]
(;B[pl]LB[cn:A]C[Here I hesitated between this and an approach maybe at A.
I wanted first to try to keep his stones separated.

ff - It is too late for thinking this. White has basically broken out. It is better to keep this idea in reserve and to approach at A now. Depending on how things develop later you may want to choose something different on the right side.]
;W[qn];B[rn];W[ol];B[pk];W[ok]
(;B[cn]C[ff - My initial feeling is that this is a good move by Black - it is not worth continuing on the right at this time. However, Q10 is going to be painful when it comes, so in fact Black would have been better off without playing Q8 etc.]
;W[fq]
(;B[bp]C[ff - This is natural but it invites the invasion by White.]
;W[mq]C[ff - Trivial. This is a big opportunity for Black]
(;B[lq];W[cl];B[en];W[el]
(;B[dk]LB[cg:A]C[I played this move because I thought it would help me to defend A and make some points toward the center

ff - This stone has hardly any effect on C13. However, White's reply has a direct effect on Black's weakness at D6. Considering the positions above and below this is a loss for Black.]
;W[dl];B[cq];W[dq];B[gn]C[I feel like c2 would have been better but I didn't want him to make too much points in the center

ff - Black is thinking about the position in the wrong way. There is only one overriding issue at this point - can Black capture the 3-stone White pillar or not! Until the White stones are safe, there is no idea of White making territory in the center.]
;W[mp]C[ff - Basically White has seen the weak point in Black's lower left corner while Black has not. However, beyond that is the fact that Black continues to let White dictate the pace of the game. There is no way that the area around N4 is bigger than that around D8, not to mention H3!]

C[Honnestly, I didn't read the sequence... it's been a while]

(;B[fj]C[ff - This runs the risk of being too small in comparison to what White will make on the bottom.]
;W[gl];B[iq]LB[gd:A]TR[gq][hq][jq][kq]SQ[hj][ij][jj][kj]C[I didn't read the sequence quite well.
The idea was not to save my stones but to use them to reduce white potential
- from behind (triangles)
- and from the top

and then play something like A to try to make points in the center as well

ff - Black has a bad habit of playing too passively, i.e. in answering all of White's aggressive moves. Here Black transfers that habit to the opponent by imagining that White will follow him around the board!]
