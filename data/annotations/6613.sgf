(;W[qf]C[Worgle : I'm not sure about this move. I was thinking of closing the corner and press the black stone at the same time... but I m not sure it was good...]

(;B[eq]C[black missed a chance by playing this move. See variation]
;W[er];B[fp];W[gr]
(;B[hp]C[this move is wrong. it is important to take first sente and play the extension on the left side. it would be an extension both from the wall and from the upper corner]

(;W[jc]C[Worgle : is this sequence ok for white ? Can I end it here ?]
;B[lc];W[gc];B[nc]C[Worgle : This two black stones looks weak to me, but should I attack them now ? And if yes how ?]

(;W[cj]C[I think it is better to invade here than attacking the black stones. You should attack weak stones to gain something. if not, play elsewhere]

(;B[cl]C[this is completely wrong. compare with the other option.]
;W[cg]C[white gets a comfortable extension and it cannot be well attacked as in the other option, because c16 is far]
;B[lq];W[nq];B[jp];W[hr];B[kq];W[ir];B[dj];W[di];B[ej]
(;W[ke]C[Worgle : When all the sides are almost taken, I never realy know where to play. Is L15 ok ?

I think l15 is not ok because m17 cannot be killed easily this way. it can live on the side. I'd better defend the corner while attacking]

(;B[me];W[oe];B[mg];W[ee];B[ei];W[dh];B[jk]C[Worgle : This hurt ! After this move I thought I will lose this game... Is there anything that I must do against this move right now or earlier in the game ?

Clearly, better to reduce before. Two issues: 
1 - I think that anyway you can win if you start the endgame and play the big points. 
2 - e15 looks to me as an empty move. what is his purpose? does it mark points or attack something?]

(;W[om]C[this is another empty move, because it doesn't mark points. better to take yourself the point that you induce black to play]
;B[qh];W[og];B[oi];W[nh]C[the idea is good: push the weak group towards black moyo and then destroy the moyo]
;B[lh];W[ni];B[oj]
(;W[nj]C[here you missed a good move. o10 is not threatening very much]
;B[lj];W[lm];B[jm];W[kp];B[jo];W[lp];B[lo];W[mp];B[hg]C[Worgle : I think this is a good move again... Can I do something ?

Reduce and take the points. if you want to defend the white group, reduce his corner]
