C[I was wondering if you can give me any general tips on how i played as white and what you can tell i need to work on?

1) Side vs center:  You could do well to concentrate more on the sides of the board in your opening.
2) Look for the big moves:  Don't play a move just because it's a response to your opponent, or because it's atari.  Check to see whether there is a bigger move around.

I hope this review helps!];B[pd];W[qo]C[Check the joseki on this one.  This is a tricky move.  The best reason bo play the 5-3 point is that you have studied it carefully, and you are confident that you know the variations better than your opponent.  If you look at how the game panned out, you didn't seem to get much for this opening move.  If you had played Q3 first, would you necessarily have followed up with R5 as your third move?  Maybe, maybe not, but the 3-4 point is more flexible.

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with this move, but you must ask yourself why you are playing it.]
;B[dd];W[dp];B[jd];W[pq]C[Should I have waited until later in the game to play q3?

Not necessarily.  This is, in context, not an unreasonable move.]
;B[cn];W[gp];B[bp];W[cq];B[jp]C[This is not a wrong move for black, but take note that the more normal joseki move would be somewhere near C10.]
;W[cf]C[Given that black's normal move would be around C10, and that a natural answer to this move would be a pincer around C10, this is maybe not an ideal attack at this point.]
;B[fc];W[dj]C[But black lets you off the hook...  I would personally have played lower here, maybe C9, but I can't say that that is necessarily much better than your move.]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[bj];W[bi];B[bk];W[ci]C[Civen that you might later be worried about eyes, C12 might be a more efficient defense against the cut.]
;B[bc];W[bd]C[Do you think b16 was too agressive at this point in the game?

Not too agressive, but not necessarily very efficient: Maybe it would be better to move up the right side, or in towards the middle
at the bottom, around M3 or so.];B[nq];W[cc]C[This is a bit of a small move at this point in the game.  Compare the result you got with what you would have gotten if black had played here.  Count the approximate points difference, and compare it with what, for example, R9 or R14 would have achieved.]
;B[cb];W[bb];B[dc];W[cd];B[ba];W[ac];B[qk]C[At this point, black also realized that sente was worth more than the small fight in the corner.]
;W[pl]C[This move might be OK, but  the black influence of O3 and K4 makes it less effective, in my opinion.
You seem to me to be building a wall in the direction of black stones.]
;B[qg]C[A very good follow-up for black.];W[pj]C[I don't quite see the point of this move.  You will be allowing black to run along the 3rd line, making territory, while you build a wall facing the center, where territory is notoriously hard to come by.]
;B[qi];W[ph];B[qh];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk];B[rl];W[ql];B[sk];W[rm]
;B[mc]C[Now might be a good time for a 3-3 point invasion....]
;W[jo]C[This is a very high move.  I would think it would be better to attack from below, maybe J3 or so, to make territory at the bottom in sente.  This move tries to get influence to the center, where you would be hard pressed to make good territory.  In the meantime, black can make a strong base at the bottom.]
;B[ef]C[Here black is extending his territory very comfortably.  If your previous move had been sente, this would have been your turn to make territory.]
;W[eg];B[hd];W[gg];B[lp]C[Here black is making his bottom group stronger, and at the same time pushing into the center.]

;W[gq];B[gr];W[fr];B[hr];W[fq]C[This move was very small.  You could rather have used the influence you got while black was building his group at the bottom more effectively, maybe with a move at E6 or somewhere like that.]
;B[eo]C[Here black is effectively neutralizing your influence.  This is because you were not careful enough about sente vs gote.]
;W[ep]C[This is a negative response to blacks push. Ask yourself:  What are you defending against?  Is it worth it?]
;B[gn];W[fn];B[en];W[em]C[Here I would rather play F5.];B[fo]

C[A very small move, compared to the battle raging in the middle of the board!]
;B[eb];W[ca];B[ea];W[jl]C[Good time to turn back!  You at least got sente.]

;W[ln]C[Good!];B[mq];W[hj]C[Small move!!  Better to attack black's four stones at K9 by playing somewhere like N11.  J13 also looks good.  A nice sente move.]
;B[da];W[cb];B[mn];W[lj]C[Good!];B[ll]
(;W[jn]C[No!  Better to run out at N7 than to let him get that atari.  See variation.]
;B[mm];W[in];B[sm]C[Black should have connected at N8.];W[ml]
;B[mk];W[nl];B[ol];W[lk]C[Your stones at N8 are in a bit of trouble now.  In retrospect, I am sure you would have preferred, for example, an atari against P8.]
;B[nk];W[nm];B[om];W[nn];B[mo]
(;W[jj]C[Was this move Here at k10 a useless move?

Well, it does take away a liberty, but I think you might have done better.

I tried to see what could possibly happen if you played P6 instead, and with equally incorrect play
on both sides, it looks as if black dies, but I'm not a dan-player, so I can't read this one clearly.]

(;B[kj]C[Black should have played P6 instead. (see variation.)]

(;W[pk]C[Not necessary:  If black plays Q9, you can play O10, then he needs to play S11 in gote.
(see variation)];B[do]C[OK, so black's brain was in neutral, lucky for you!]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[sj];B[rk]C[stupid move!  Black was angry at losing his stones.]
;W[sk];B[sh];W[si];B[os];W[of]C[Maybe the 3-3 point was still worth a try.  If black gets all that territory at the top, you have lost, so it is a good time to try invading, even if you're not sure you can make it work.]
