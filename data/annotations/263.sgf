[0.5];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[do];W[qj];B[qg]L[eq][fp][cq][ed]C[There's no urgency for B R13, because  of the symmetrical position on the right side. I would prefer a (e3), b (f4),  c (c3) or d (e16).]
;W[qm];B[mq]C[The very first lesson in "the  breakthrough to shodan" warns against the large knight's move. This move is  difficult to master; there's still a lot of room for W to create trouble in  the corner. In this game, B has already made 2 large knight's moves...]
;W[ed];B[fp]L[eq]C[B f4 may be better at a (e3). This makes it harder for W  to ignore it.]
;W[dj]L[jc]C[The tenuki by W here is a good idea. W would get an  ideal position with an extra move at 'a' (k17).]
;B[cl]M[dj]L[er]C[B c8 is  not good. W can easily live in the bottom left corner as the game showed, and  the outside thickness that B can get in return is already diminished by the  marked stone at D10. B does not get enough compensation for giving a large  corner to W. Here, B must put more pressure on W and create a moyo on the  lower side by playing at a (e2).]
;W[co]
(;B[cn]C[B might  also consider the other joseki (see variation) but it ends in gote.]
;W[cp];B[eo]L[dn]C[B e5 doesn't make good shape. Here the solid connection at a (d6) is  better.]
;W[fr]C[B can no longer build a moyo on the lower side.  White is already leading. This is the consequence of the bad move at c8.]
;B[mc]L[dh][jc][gc]C[Since B is behind, he should play more agressively, for example at a  (d12). Also, n17 still leaves the corner open at r17, so it is very doubtful.  If B wants to play on the upper side it should be at b (k17) which has a good  followup at c (g17) if W plays on the upper right.]
;W[hc];B[jq]L[qo][dh]M[fr]C[B k3 is not good. The lower side is open anyway  because of the marked stone at f2, so there is not much territory to be had  here. If B wants to play on the lower side it should be at a (r5), but here  it is probably better to invade at b (d12).]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[kc]L[qc][fj]C[Invading at a (r17) or building a moyo at b (f10) would be  bigger.]
;B[dh]C[Finally!];W[ck];B[de];W[ce]
(;B[cf]L[np]C[Playing solidly at d14  might be better (see some variations). W has a good ladder break at a (o4) so  there is a risk that W cuts at d14.]
;W[ef];B[fh];W[dl];B[dm];W[bl];B[cm];W[hh]
(;B[fj]C[This leaves a weakness at e11. I would attack on a  larger scale at g11 after connecting in sente at d14 (see variation).]

[ek];B[dk];W[ci];B[ch];W[ei];B[bk];W[cj];B[df];W[eh]
(;B[eg]C[B helps W to  reinforce. B should push at d16 immediately to take advantage of the W  weaknesses (see variation).]
;W[fg];B[dg];W[ee];B[bi];W[bj];B[be];W[dd];B[bd];W[bc];B[bg]C[It is painful for B to live in gote like this.]

;W[kj];B[pc]L[qe][qc]C[Big, but there is still a weakness at r15 (see variations).  Playing at b (r17) instead would secure the corner.]

(;W[ll];B[jk]C[Moves like  B k9 pushing into a knight's move are rarely good. They mostly reinforce the  opponent.]
;W[jj];B[lk]
(;W[lj]C[W should cut (see variation).];B[mk];W[kk];B[kl];W[lm]C[This position is less favorable to W than the variation seen  earlier.]

[nk];W[oj]M[ni]L[pl]C[Capturing the marked stone at o11 is not enough compensation for giving up  the right side. W must still reinforce at a (q8) first.]
;B[pj];W[oi];B[pi];W[nh];B[qk]M[jn][lm][ll][nl][mp]L[pm][gp]C[B is happy but could even attack the whole  marked group by playing at a (q7) instead, to punish the W overplay. However  the bad aji at b (g4) is annoying.]
;W[pl];B[oh];W[ni];B[pk];W[on];B[rq]C[Now B makes profit in sente!];W[qo]
;B[le]C[Good.];W[og]C[This is not sente.]
(;B[ph]C[B is too submissive (see  variation)];W[md];B[ng]L[li]C[Now W will be constantly be bothered by  the cut at a (m11). This confirms that W p10 was bad.]

(;B[lg]C[B should cut at o16 now  (see variation).]

(;B[hq]L[gp]C[This removes the bad aji of W a (g4) (see  variations).]

(;B[lr]C[B is too submissive here.  Since B was strengthened with B h3, B can now play more agressively (see  variation).]
