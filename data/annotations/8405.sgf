Degan: I have glanced through the game, and I will go through it now to review in more detail.  At first glance, I saw some blunders by both sides.  This might be caused by playing under too fast of time constraints.  To at least take a breath between each move can help to avoid such mistakes.  Also, fighting will become less about destroying the other group and more about gaining and reducing territory.

Degan: Notes after reviewing.  Nice continuation after a large blunder.  Some players collapse their spirit after a big reversal of fortune.  Your defensive fighting is strong, perhaps think about invading the opponent's framework's earlier.

After move 26, the game is white's and black has to hope for a large oportunity to get back in the game.  You were even still ahead after a 40 point blunder.

For this review, I spent a lot of fairly useless variations on fighting black's upper left group.  In a closer game, they might have been significant.  You can see how much closer black brought the game.  For future gains, you may get more out of picking a game for review where you lost, especially if you do not understnad the core reasons why the loss occured.

I hope this review is useful to you, please contact me with any questions:

;B[qj];W[jp]C[Degan: Opening is fine.];B[lq]
(;W[ic]SQ[oc][od]C[Chavez [17k\]: would a pincer at P3 be bigger?

Degan: Playing white at P3 is playing into a black pincer.  Black should appreciate this move.  See variations.  However, I do not like J17.  It is too far from D17, and too close to K16.  Consider an approach move at P16 or P17, despite K16.]
;B[gc]SQ[jc]C[Degan: For black, K17 is a much better response]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[hd]
(;B[ib]C[Degan: Mistake by black.  If you want to cut, then cut.  See variation.  In hindsight, this could be seen as the move that loses the game for black.]
;W[jc];B[id];W[jb]
(;B[ia]C[Degan: Wrong for black.]
(;W[oc]C[Degan: Based on this, I would expect white to win.  Balack will have trouble creating life for the top group with this shape.  Nice extension (though large?risky) and approach.  This sort of combination move is very valuable.]
;B[pc];W[ja]SQ[mc][od]C[Degan: This is only a forcing move if black does not read-out that the stones are dead.  So it does not assist the weakened P17.  I have marked better choices.]
(;B[hb];W[fc];B[fb];W[ga]C[Degan: It is excellent that you see this move.  Black is dead. Really the game is over with the territorial lead (50 points?) and influence lead that white has achieved.]
(;B[ec];W[fd]
(;B[gb];W[eb];B[kc];W[fa];B[kb];W[ha];B[ke];W[oe]C[Degan: P16 is better, as black demonstrates with the next move.]
;B[od];W[nd];B[pd];W[me]C[Chavez [17k\]: even though P17 can now be captured I decided to make a wall at M-O to either connect with top right or escape into the centre. was this a good idea?

Degan: Yes, this is a good idea.  With the enourmous lead in both territory and influence, there is no need for white to try to make life in a difficult area.  Instead, use the weak top right group to split black's two top groups and pressure the top middle group.  This reduces black territory and uses the white influence.]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[ka]C[Degan: very good. Now white is connected.  You no longer need to be concerned about life for the top right group and can use it to agressively pressure.]
;B[nf];W[ne];B[mf];W[ld];B[kd];W[pg]SQ[pf]C[Degan: Too far with all of the support that black has surrounding.  Sometimes small extensions ar valuable because they are certain.]

(;W[ph]C[Degan: I suggest this was a move that costs you dearly.]
;B[nh];W[mg];B[lf];W[qh];B[re]
(;W[li]SQ[mg][ng]C[Degan: Yes, it is important to recognize that the marked stones are vital cutting stones.  However the black stones on the right have an inviting weakness you should explore.  Whatever choice black makes, it is strongly sente for white.]
;B[rf];W[mh];B[oi];W[kf];B[le];W[if]C[Chavez [17k\]: can't believe i didn't see this

Degan: This is a blunder.  It happens to everyone.  Even famously on YTube, some televised professional matches.  Worse, in this case, you forced the atari with your L14 move.  Always before you play, imagine you opponents's response.]
;B[md]C[Chavez [18k\]: щгср
Chavez [18k\]: ouch
elect31 [18k\]: ^^];W[lb]SQ[if][kf][mg][ng][mh][li]C[Degan: This is a waste of a move.  Given the blunder, sit back and consider the board for some time.  The urgent task is recover any value from the marked stones which have been weakened considerably, but can still be of great value.  The N17/N18 stones are not valuable and not at risk.]
;B[kg];W[jf];B[lh];W[kh];B[lg];W[mi];B[jh];W[kq]SQ[gg][cn][fq]
C[Chavez [17k\]: once he breaks out into the centre I decided to attack bottom and build up some influence

Degan: This is a reasonable idea.  Discounting your large blunder, you should see that your fighting is of higher quality than your opponent, and be more agressive.  This small reduction move is not too much of an attack and should be welcomed by black as a chance to consolidate territory.  However, you are far ahead in territory, consider some moves that allow no chance of losing the territory.]
;B[ki]SQ[lo][lp]C[Degan: Worthless move by black. L11 and K12 were miai.  A move at the marked locations is required.]

;B[fn];W[eo];B[ej];W[ei];B[fi];W[fj]C[Degan: This does not actually work, unless your opponenent responds wrong.  However, I like it as a sacrifice.  So I guess you can play it as a sacrifice and then gain profit if your opponent makes an error.  See these variations.]

;W[ii];B[ih];W[gl];B[eh]C[Degan: a large sacrifice by black for this.  White has huge territorial lead.]
(;W[hh]C[Degan: In this case, this cut works, but being ahead, it would be safer to approach from the other side and simply consolidate territory.  See variation, I do not think black can live...  .]
;B[gh];W[hg];B[de];W[gg];B[fh]
(;W[ee]SQ[ec]C[Degan: There should be no concern with balck connection to this non-cutting stone.  See variations.  B11/B12 become  key points to stop black from  obtaining and getting the strength of the small group below]
;B[he];W[ge];B[ie];W[hf];B[ef];W[df];B[dg];W[ff];B[cf]C[Chavez [17k\]: for some strange reason i thought I had a ko battle here. forgot to create ko first =(

Degan: Even if you had a ko, this threat is small compared with black's fight for life on the left.  If black lives, then the score becomes much closer.  I estimate the move you make at about 20 points, and the fight on the right from 40 to 60.  Se the variation, I ignore your threat on the right completely.]
