C[Hi.
A game played on KGS. I'm playing black. Ive added some questions but any comments you can think of are very welcome.
Thank you for taking the time to review this game.


[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
A very close game, that white won in the end.  After looking through it I think that black both COULD and SHOULD have won this, if only he'd taken a little more time to think.
Small mistakes that are easy to improve and understand, and the good news is then of course that black has the potential to get quite a bit stronger fast.]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pp];W[cd]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
So far so good.  A normal opening of the game.];B[oc];W[fc]
;B[ep]C[I was thinking R10 but was thinking id like to play something else for once. What would be a good way to approach the top left corner shimari by white? Is a peep at B16 possible as it is in blacks corner enclosure?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
B16 would not be good, after B15 or B17 you'd be left with only two liberties and no good plan for the future.  Besides, it's on the second row.  If you want to attack in that corner I believe E16 would have the best prospects.
Another move you could have considered here is D10, splitting white's corners.]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
F4 is thick.  I think F2 or G3 looks better.
K3 and R10 are also good moves now, as well as D10 still.];W[nq]
;B[lq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
R6 or P3 would probably both have been better.  The right flank is more open than the bottom.]
;W[qn];B[np];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Instead of Q5 I think R9 would pay better off.];W[qm];B[qo]
;W[ro];B[nn]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
O6 is gote and achieves nothing.
R10 and D10 are big moves.
S6, S4 or R2 can be the start of a counter-attack.];W[pj];B[qh]
;W[dg];B[ck];W[cm];B[ch]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Sensible.  But J17 or K17 are bigger.];W[cg];B[bl];W[bh];B[bi]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[di];B[bg]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Black has captured one stone.
White has gotten a wall with influence towards the centre.
White has gained in this exchange.];W[bf];B[ah];W[fg];B[jc]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Finally a big move again.  Very good!];W[hc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
H17 is small for white.  Good for you.];B[oh]C[Was this the right cours of action? Or should i have first played K15 threatening to come into whites territory and then p12?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Perhaps...  But not K15.  J15 would have done the same, but one better.  No matter, I don't think the edges are "full" yet, and I feel it's a bit early to start battling for the centre.
Consider R9, F2, B6 and D6.];W[mf];B[of]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
P14 is small, it's thick it's gote.  It's absolutely not making life hell for white.  Thinking "attack from a distance" you could consider J15, K14 or indeed Tengen.]
;W[md];B[mc];W[lc];B[ld];W[le];B[kd];W[ke];B[nd]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This went fairly well for you.  You get the territory from the edge up to the fourth row, and can be satisfied with that.]
;W[jd];B[kc];W[je];B[qr]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I think I would have captured on N15 or extended to J17.  With a stone at J17 you could have played an aji stone on H16 and used it later to press towards the corner with atari on H2.
And I still think R9 and B6 looks good.  So does Tengen.];W[rq]
;B[gm]C[White had secures so much territory at the top left i decided that i need to try and take some myself. Is this ok? Would S10 have worked?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
S10 would have been very safe, small and a bit thick.
When you see enough to consider S10 a natural idea would be to look at R9 as well.
The problem with G7 is that besides being gote it doesn't add to your territory on it's own.]
;W[nl];B[lm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
M7 is small.  And gote.  Look at my earlier suggestions, there are many moves closer to the edge you could have played here.]
;W[ic];B[lb]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
WHAT?  Not capturing at N15 at this point must count as deliberately helping the enemy.]
;W[me];B[jj];W[ig];B[hi];W[fj];B[gk];W[jl]C[Is this overplay by white, or did i get lucky?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Too brave by white, so I say it's both.];B[kk];W[kl];B[ll];W[jk]
;B[kj];W[hl];B[gl];W[ij];B[ii];W[hj];B[gj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
So far this struggle has been ok and made some sense.];W[lk]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This is really a mistake by white, and you should strike down upon it at once.]
;B[lj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
M10 is not good.  N9 would have captured white in a ladder leading to P12 and death for white.]
;W[mk];B[mi]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Now is the time to kill the stones around J8.  J9 would be a beautiful move to do this.  White H9, Black J7 and white gets either split or surrounded with only one eye.]
;W[mm];B[ln];W[mo];B[mn];W[no];B[ml]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I think O7 is better, especially if you play P8 afterwards.]
;W[on];B[nk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Rather capture at O7!  The other three stones would get very weak ofter that.]
;W[oo]C[should i have have sacrificed the stones at the bottom right in order to stop the snake from coming into my territory?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Absolutely not!  The snake is not connected to safe groups and can still be cut off.]
;B[op];W[mp];B[mq];W[nr];B[or]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I think Q6 looks better.  Besides, the O2 group can be attacked just as well with N2.]
;W[lp];B[kq];W[kp];B[jn];W[jp];B[jm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
K7 is a wasted stone.  K3 would have been much better.];W[jq]
;B[mr];W[pn];B[oq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
P3 does nothing.  P8 would gain you a bit.];W[pl];B[ol];W[pk]
C[Does any 3-3 invasion at the top left work? I wonder cause white closed it.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Difficult question...  As a rule it "should not" work.  But against this particular opponent I think I would have given it a try. Besides, as long as your opponent is forced to reply you don't really lose anything.  The prisoners you give the opponent are balanced by territory he fills with his own stones.]
;B[io];W[hq];B[hp];W[gq];B[gp];W[jr];B[kr];W[fr];B[bm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Here you could have played B6.  But I think G2 is better.  It gives you the chance to play atari both at E2 and J3.]
;W[bn];B[qi]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Nope!  R11 is painfully small.
Cut at C6!];W[qj];B[hg];W[hf];B[gg];W[gf];B[gh];W[fi];B[dm]
;W[dn];B[cl];W[en];B[em];W[cn];B[fn];W[dj];B[cj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
F12 would have been better.
Other moves to consider are D4, E2, S2, K13.];W[fh]C[Here im stupid and not careful enough

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
But still you could have turned that into gain.];B[rj];W[gi]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I think this move is bad judgement by white.  S10 is a danger not to be ignored.]
;B[jh]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
A follow-up from S10 to S8 could have merit?];W[hh];B[mg]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
S8 is sente, N13 can wait.];W[rk];B[sj];W[sk];B[ri];W[ih];B[ji]
;W[jg];B[kg];W[lg];B[lh];W[kf];B[kh]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Capture at M14 instead.];W[ng];B[mh];W[nf];B[og];W[nh];B[ni]
;W[rr];B[pr]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Q2 is meaningless.  O1 and you live.  You could just let white capture R2, it would be gote.]
;W[cc]C[This needed?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Probably a good idea for white.  Even if D17 looks a bit more elegant.]
;B[oi]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
J2 is better.];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[af];W[be];B[ae];W[ad];B[ag]
;W[dp];B[eo];W[do];B[ne];W[ip];B[jo];W[ks];B[ls];W[js];B[ns]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
O1 isn't needed.  F9 is better.];W[rs];B[ja]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
K19 is one of the very last moves to play in the endgame.  You end up in gote, and it's only worth 1/2 moku.  R1 or F9 are bigger.]

(;W[tt]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
White could have pressed at R1 as you know.  So it was a little too early to pass.]
