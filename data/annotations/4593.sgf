C[Dear Reviewer,

In this game I played Black, and lost by a wide margin. The main issue I would like to get your help on is the conflict between influence and territory: I tried to build influence but failed to turn it into real territory. Yuor advices will be highly appreciated for other points as well in this game.



Thanks! Avi];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[cg]
(;B[fe]LB[ef:a][be:b][dg:c]C[I later saw that F15 is not according to the Joseky book...

--> The jump is not usually bad against a pincer, but in this specila case white is threating to connect under, and the jump is a bit slack in regard of this.

Besides the 3-3 attachement, you can also keep white divided with the kosumi 'a' or jumping to the side with 'b', 'c' is playable but more rare.]
;W[ce]C[--> Now white can connect, please compare the game results with my proposal here.]

(;B[cf]
(;W[df];B[cd];W[bf];B[dd];W[cc];B[fc]C[Here and in the folIowing plays I considered B16 but decided to block on the right side; Was it a good decision?

--> B16 is not small but the point of dividing groups is to attack them when they are weak, and it does not seem that neither would be weak enough to be worth attacking.

I think that building a big moyo to the right is a good choice.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[bd]C[Now the top left corner is White's and the two groups are connected...

--> Yes, and the corner is not small, but at least black has sente and all the white stones are on the left side while black position does not look bad.]
;B[kd]LB[pj:a][pf:b][jp:c][nc:d]C[--> I think that this is a bit of overconcentration at the top, I would rater play something from a to d.]
;W[qn];B[ql];W[np]
(;B[oo]C[--> This kosumi is a bit slack, the joseki I propose is the one usually played here. Black can tenuki and the white follow up is not that terrible.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[no];W[op];B[po];W[qj];B[qh]C[I am not sure about this move. I could split the 1 white stones, for example by Q8 - but this leaves the Q5 group overconcentrated and openning wide the upper part for invasion. What do you say?

--> I agree, Q9 seems a bit better for that purpose anyway, but the pincer at R12 seems OK.]
;W[rl]
(;B[qk]C[Should I have played S9?

--> I rather prefer S7, see variation, and there's a mistake on the line you propose for S9 too.]
;W[rk];B[pj];W[qi];B[pi];W[rh];B[ri];W[rj];B[rg];W[si];B[qg]
C[I was satisfied with the formation on this side

--> I still prefer the result after S7 I propose, but this does not seem bad.

The main problem with black efforts to build a moyo to the center is the white ponnuki at c14: F13 is becoming more and more a very important point, so sente is a very important thing from now on.]
;W[mc]LB[lb:a][lc:b][oc:c][md:d][me:e]C[...but how to deal with thisinvasion?

--> From a to e seems possible ...];B[me]C[During the game this seemed to me the best move - limits White to the top and let him live small. But after the game I thought M17 may be better - chasing White to the center and tking profit on both sides?

--> I think black is strong enough in the srurroundings to go for a more agressive action than the one played.
M17 or 18 or P17, for example.];W[kb];B[jc];W[pb]
(;B[oc]C[--> I dont think that this is good, as it forces white to live too quickly, and does'nt protect the corner.
See variations.];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[lc];W[lb];B[md];W[mb];B[eg]
C[--> There are 2 problems here, one is that letting white R17 free will make white to live too big.
The other is that the keima at E13 seems a bit dangerous
F12 would be better, I think.];W[ef];B[ff];W[fg]C[I was prepared for this cut, and...]
;B[fh];W[gg];B[ei]C[At this point I thought White will have hard time living. What happened later was that this group became very strong and erased most of my thickness... What went wrong?

--> You were not actually prepared :)
seriously, I think the cut is reasonable, and even if the fight might be a bit in black's favour, white can live easily and the question is how much black can benefite fron the attack.]
;W[hh]TR[pm]C[--> Look at this position and try to visualize who do have now -regardless of who is to play- more space to run with the 3 floating stones: 3 white and 3 black.

You should take into account possible side effects at the Q7 point: picture a white stone there !]

(;B[hi]C[--> Don't touch what you are attacking ! It can bite back !

attachment moves tend to strengthen what they touch, so are ususally defensive moves, here H10 or K12 are the really attacking moves.]
;W[ii]
(;B[gh]C[G11 better?

--> better shape, yes. now the resulting position is the same as after a 2 step hane by white after a hane on top of 2 stones.]
;W[ig];B[ij];W[hj];B[gi];W[jj];B[ik];W[jh]
(;B[hf]C[I thought H14 was sente, but apparently I was wrong - I should have pushed at K9. But even so, White could get life in the middle of my moyo, so something is still wrong with my previous moves.

--> H11 and G12 were both wrong, but the question was not how to kill white but how to get enough compensation.
To get to the root of the problem: the keima at E13 does'nt seem good. The 2 space jump at F12 is better.

Of course H14 was not sente, so you had to K9, but after that I propose a better follow up than E5.]
;W[jk];B[hg];W[il]C[--> this is too good for white, cutting at H13 is too small.]
;B[hk];W[hl];B[gk];W[km]C[--> game over now: white got to erase black moyo and to build the strenght tower the lower side.]
;B[mp]
(;W[mq]C[--> I think white has a better move here, to avoid strenghten black too much. See variation]

(;B[nq]C[--> I think that just M3 is better, now white will have better shape.]
;W[oq];B[lq];W[nr]
(;B[lo];W[lr];B[kq]C[Is this considered good shape for Black? I doubt it...

--> Is the safer way, but may be you can try some of the variations I propose. They are riskier, though.

OTOH, now black is very strong and white has lost the value of the marked stones.
The sequence here has been in black favor, in my opininon.]
;W[mn];B[mo]
(;W[om]C[--> This is the wrong direction to attack, see alternative.]
;B[nm];W[nn];B[on];W[pm];B[kl];W[ll];B[ln];W[mm]
(;B[lm]C[O8 better?

--> Don't think so. Your strategy here is bold, but it seems quite a success to me ... even if white helps :)]
;W[nl];B[lk];W[ml];B[jm]
(;W[kk]C[--> This seems a mistake though ... see variation.]
;B[jl];W[lj]
(;B[eo]C[I tried now to make the most of my thickness here - and again, disappointing results. Is this the right approach?

--> F4 seem more normal, but L2 is still open, so can't expect too much. Never the less, the position has been completely upset, and now black has good chances.]
;W[ep];B[fo];W[cn];B[dm];W[gq]C[With just two moves, White manages to get a ot of territory in the corner... What was I supposed to do?

--> E5 has this effect, yes. F4 instead is better.];B[gp]C[--> Bad, H4 better.]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[fp];B[go];W[iq];B[ip];W[hq];B[cm];W[dn];B[ci]
C[It is a miai here between this move and E6...

--> C11 is just territory, while E6 works with with J5 and K6 to create bad aji ... difficult to say.]
;W[en];B[fm];W[em];B[el];W[fn];B[gm];W[jp];B[io];W[jq];B[jo]
;W[bm];B[bl];W[bn];B[mi]C[May be I can get here some territory...?

--> some, but not much. Anyway lower side is now too big.];W[mj]
;B[qc];W[qb]
(;B[kr]C[This I think was a mistake, because of White's next moves - especially the clamp on N12

--> There are also some issues with the ko left at J12, see variations. The clamp is big, but not as big as it seems.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd];W[mh]C[Yes, I should have blocked this instead of L2

--> I don't agree, L2 is very big, and only at the upper side you can find comparable moves. Next B9 clamp is also powerfull.

The longest variation proposed seems to me the more reasonable yose -although yose is not my strongest point- and it seems a playable game.]

(;B[li]C[--> This is not reasonable any way. See variations.]
;W[ni];B[ki];W[ji];B[nh];W[oh];B[ng];W[oi];B[ph];W[og];B[mg]
;W[kj];B[lg];W[oe]C[At this point I think White lead quite comfortably, and the rest of the game is just techincal - What do you say?
Anyway, thank you in advance for your time and effort!
Avi

--> This last move is small, yet white managed to play the enormous moves at B9 and H18, so the lead still increased from now on, even if white made also some mistakes later losing 3 stones at the right side.]
