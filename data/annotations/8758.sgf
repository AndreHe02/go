C[Dear reviewer, I am Kurato1 and i play black here.
I am interesting in a fuseki mistakes, urgent points and weak points in my shapes and connections.

I don't like moyo and usually prefer territory, because it is solid. But in this game i try to build influence and i also would like to know which big points i have missed.

My oponent have done lots of mistakes, but i was lucky to win only 1.5 moku, which means that i have done lots of mistakes too. Please show me my weak moves.

Thanks in advance!

Hi Kurato1,

comparing to the last game I reviewed for you, I can see good progress. I think especially your shapes got better.
In this game you played for influence and a big moyo. My opinion is that you did not know how to use the influence properly. So I think you should practice this more.
I also noticed at least 3 unnecessary (ko) fights in this game. If you have the lead, you should play calm.
If you have further questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,

(;B[np]LB[nq:A]C[F: Because White's shape is very weak, you can play the double hane at 'A', which presses White to the second line.]

(;W[lq];B[pj]C[Here i think good start, because my oponent has low position at the bottom

F: Yes, Black is in a better position.];W[mc]
(;B[me]LB[jc:A]C[F: Something is wrong with this move in my opinion.
On the one hand, this move is consistent in terms of building a moyo on the right. This is good.
On the other hand it is pretty easy for White to settle. And it is like Black putting all eggs in one basket, because you just have stones in one part of the board. This is not good.
My choice would probably be the piner at 'A'.];W[kd];B[do]LB[kd:2]
[me:1][kf:A]C[F: In my opinion Black now needs an additional move at 'A' because of the 1-2-exchange.]
;W[co]LB[dl:A][cm:B]C[F: Left side has the biggest potential now, so I would prefer a pincer at 'A' or 'B']
;B[cn];W[cp];B[dm];W[fq]C[Another 3rd line white stone

F: Yes, Black's overall position seems much better.];B[jo]LB[kd:2]
[me:1][kf:B][ci:C][mj:A]C[F: This move is kind of vague. There are several reasons:
First: As you pointed out, White is very low on the bottom. That means there is not much developement potential for him. Thus playing in this area has little value.
If you want to increase the right side, you should play 'A' or 'B'.
But the urgent move now is 'C'.]

;B[sh]LB[ce:B][ci:A]C[Probably too early, eight points in gote?

F.: Yes, this is to small because it is gote. Black should play 'A' or 'B' instead.]
;W[rh];B[sg];W[si];B[rf];W[ce]C[F.: White gets to play the big move.]
;B[ic]LB[ob:B][kf:A][ci:C]C[Is this point good for invasion? I was afraid white responce in j15

F.: This is not a good invasion point in my opinion.
White has 'A' or 'B' to jump out or settle. So this group is not in danger.
Your stone on the other hand is sandwiched in between two white groups.
I think you should still play 'C' on the left side.]
(;W[gc];B[ie];W[jd]C[Huge mistake i think

F.: At least it makes it easy for you to decide where to play next. :-)]
;B[id];W[kf]C[I assume that white l16 group is unsettled, but i cant see an appropriate way to attack it

F.: The problem is that you are unsettled too. Because you have to take care of you own, you cannot attack severly.]
(;B[jf]LB[ge:B][jg:A]C[F.: 'A' would be a better attacking move, but because your group is weak, you should play 'B'.]

;W[li];B[lj];W[jj];B[ih];W[hj]
(;B[gi]LB[mf:A]C[F: White created another weak group.
I would play 'A' immediatly, because it threatens to cut and destroys eye shape.]

Your move is not forcing and gives White a lot of options.]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[ch];B[ef]LB[dj:B][cl:A]C[F.: If I were I White I would play 'A' now, because your move is not really threatening.
I think Black should play 'B'.];W[de];B[df];W[cf];B[cj]C[F:: Better on the fourth line.]
