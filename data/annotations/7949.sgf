LB[hq:A][qn:D][qm:D][dh:E][ch:E][qf:B][mc:C]MA[jj]C[With proper play White can always live with this invasion.  However,
it is not always profitable for White because Black (while defending)
builds thickness, which can be worth more later in the game than
White's few points of territory.

Basically your failure to take advantage of this is why you lost
the center and the game.   (See also comment on move 107).

So the question is how should Black make the best use of that
thickness?  This is not a tactical but a strategic question.

After White has settled the top left corner (which happens around
game move 25), I think Black should:

1. First, instead of the game move 25 put a stone on H3 (A).
This more or less secures the bottom side.

2. Next, secure the top right corner with stones around R14 (B)
and N17 (C).

3. Do not play around R6-R7 (D) yet, as White's reply with indirectly
strengthen his center stone.  Instead, now is the time to focus
on White's marked center stone, which is vulerable.  "Focus"
can mean anything from directly attacking to applying pressure.
You can expect a fight, and White can probably keep the stone
alive.  But you can make more territory when fighting.  

4. Later, when you have the chance, put a defensive stone around
C12-D12 (E).];B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb]MA[fc]C[I think Black 15 should be at F17 (X) to prevent White's attacking the E17 stone.  

You made several similar little tactical mistakes in the game. Individually they are not important (only worth a few points each) but they add up.]

[cd][ec]C[I don't think you needed to play here yet.  This area is pretty
well protected by Black's marked stones.

It appears that White may threaten playing at F16 (A), 
for instance, which would make the White group thick and threaten
expansion to the right.  But in the end that would probably benefit Black (see variation).

So you should probably play somewhere else where more support is needed, such as R14 (B).]

(;B[do]LB[qf:A][qm:B]MA[hq]C[This doesn't accomplish anything for Black.  It only helps White

I would prefer to see Black play H3 (X).

I previously mentioned R14 (A).  This is also playable, but White can safely ignore it and play R7 (B) to build a base.  See variation.]
;W[co];B[eq]MA[hq]C[H3 is still better.  From where you played Black cannot live.

After playing H3, Black can think about pressuring White's center
stone.];W[ep];B[dq];W[dp];B[fp];W[fr];B[es];W[cq];B[cr];W[er]

;W[br];B[bq];W[bs];B[cn];W[dn];B[bn]MA[hq]C[This whole sequence is wasteful because Black's stones are already
lost (dead).  True, Black can force White to defend a little
bit.  But this doesn't give Black any territory and it makes
the White formation much more solid.  The more Black tries to fight in vain, the more White profits.

So I still think you could play at H3 any time.  That would improve
Black's chances.];W[bm];B[dm];W[eo];B[en];W[an];B[bo];W[ao]

The variation explores another possibility.

Black needs to counter White's expansion across the top.  Something
like N17 (X) should be considered.]

C[IMPORANT COMMENT:  I see a theme developing here, which is that
White attacks small clusters of Black stones, Black tries in
vain to defend them, and White expands his own influence as the
result.

One reason this can happen is that White finds sente moves (seizes
the initiative) better than Black does.

Black's strategy from this point should be: (1) to solidify as
best as possible with moves like N16 you just played, (2) find
moves like any one of these four X points to assert territory,
(3) then plan some presence in the center with moves like one
of the seven points marked Y.  

At the end of the game it is very clear that White won by dominating
the center.  This is ironic, because when White invaded in the
upper left corner at C17, Black's compensation should have been
to use his greater thickness to push into the center.  But you
didn't make that happen.];W[kg];B[nf];W[mg];B[ng];W[nh];B[oh]

;W[ol];B[nm];W[nl];B[ml]MA[qh]C[This move might have certain merits but it cannot save the two
Black stones.

Also, Black needs to be careful that White cannot play around
R12 (X), for instance, which would be a logical extension from
his living group.    If Black played R12 now instead of the actual
move, it would probably save territory.];W[mk];B[on];W[pn];B[po]
;W[om];B[rl]MA[on][nm][ml]C[You didn't see this classic trap, that White can simultaneously
any two of Black's marked stones.  Only one of them can be saved.

And, as a result of this fighting, White pushes more into the
center.];W[nn];B[oo];W[mm];B[ll];W[km];B[lm];W[ln];B[lk];W[lj]

(;B[ri]MA[mp][qh][pg]C[You missed the same vulnerability as before.

It is hard to know what would be better because Black's position
is already bad.  

The variation shows one local possibility which is quite solid.

to N4 (X).];W[qg];B[rh];W[pf];B[pe];W[qe];B[qd];W[re];B[rd]
