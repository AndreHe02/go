C[Hi, 

My name is Frederic and I've been asked to review your game. I'm about 7/8k on KGS and DGS and you can find me with the name bouquetf or youshe on several servers. 
I'll put your comments after a ">" and my answer just after.
I'll comment for black but if I see typical errors from white, I'll tell you and the common punishment you may remember.

In short : 
- Have a view of all the board and take big points instead of adding stones to a living group
- Try to use strong shapes
- Be careful to double atari

Enjoy the comment :)

As white is enclosed, it's good for Black yes, but you have to extend to use your thickness.
I think A would be dangerous if white pincers. C or D would have A as a following move so they are possible I think. On 3rd line, you would play this for making a base, not for an extension. B would be a bit far I think.

Mistake not sure but for sure, probably a bit early.

You can also use such moves to deform the opponent by forcing him to play empty corners or such bad shapes.]

(;B[kd]C[It does not build any point so don't play it. It only helps White. Try to check what could bring points right now. This group is already alive so it's not useful to attack it.

I don't see any weakness to use so an invasion won't be possible I think. But you may reduce. But I think it's already over. 
The move 177 is too slow, you should go deaper. Maybe somewhere around E8]

Try to keep the overall situation when you play, always remember that winning comes from territory, not from stones you capture :) 
Also, try to keep thing simple, at our levels (let's say 15k-5k), most players try to make things complicated and can lose by makind big mistakes and forgetting big points.

Hope you enjoyed the review])
