;W[nd];B[mf]C[When white peeps, that is, plays a stone enabling him to cut you where he could not cut you before, as at O16, you are pretty much forced to reply, here at P16. This would leave both white's side groups at N16 and Q14 weak, and not abandon such a huge corner. Black was not in much danger of not escaping with the P14 stones.]
;W[od];B[eh];W[gg];B[ih];W[gi];B[ij];W[gk];B[el];W[gl];B[fn]
C[The moves E12, J12, J10 E8 were all good, especially the ones on the  right, which made an enclosure with K14 and N14 in sente. The moves on the E line are pretty high---white will still be able to play under them on the left, but under the circumstances, they were good, as they kept the pressure up. F6 was way too high. If I wanted to keep pushing at white's chain here, I would either play J8, continuing the enclosure on the J line, or G4 or G3, to not allow white room along the bottom and to make territory there myself.]
;W[pe]C[I guess this is white's best move as soon as he deems black's move non-forcing.]
;B[pg]C[This is risky, because it allows a white cut at P13. I don't know if it works, but in a high handicap game I wouldn't risk it.]
;W[qd]C[I don't follow this. I would have cut, and come back for this later.]
;B[og]C[Good.];W[cc];B[cd]C[D17 is better. The reason is that if D17-C16, black can play C15 and his D14 stone gets into the act, preventing white from running down the side.]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[bc];B[dc]C[Interesting. If white D18, then B18 and white's B17/C17 stones are the group that dies first.]
;W[bb]C[But now black had better connect. This brings out the other reason to prefer D17 to C16. In general you want to force the opponent's invasion stone to connect, while you seal your borders, rather than cut it off from the opponent's other stones and then have it fester inside your territory, but this is an exception, because the white F17 group is weak, and you don't want to give it free eyespace in this corner. This removes all the strength of moves like J8.]
;B[bd];W[db];B[cq];W[pn];B[np];W[nn];B[pl];W[lp];B[mo]C[It is generally hard to kill a stone on the fourth line, like M4, because it can always try to run---in this case, either to O6 or to G8. I would be more concerned with supporting the K4 stone. H3 and G3 both look pretty good as far as holding territory and making shape. If your goal is to protect your Q4 stone, I think R3 would be better, or even P5.]
;W[lo];B[mn];W[jo];B[io];W[jn];B[ip]C[H4 looks slightly better to me, in that it is not so crowded, and specifically it makes a later play of H6 better.]
;W[lr];B[mq];W[lq];B[nl];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[qm];W[rq];B[qr]
;W[rr];B[rn]C[Black isn't done protecting the area around P3. White's S2 means that he can again play Q3, killing either Q4 or R3/R2.This parallel descent is generally uncomfortable for the side being ``leaned on'', but then, so is everything else.]
;W[nm];B[mm]C[I guess this is desperation for Black. S5 doesn't work because of the cut at Q3, so black tries to connect, knowing the cut at N8 will come. Perhaps P3 works here. It deals with Q3, and threatens to make life at the bottom if white doesn't play something like N2 or O2. So white plays there, and now black can try black S5, white S4, black N7.]
;W[ml];B[ll]C[White's cut is effective because black can be cut again at M7.]
;W[mk];B[nk]C[This is still okay for black because it threatens a ladder, and it is good for black because it prevents white from messing around with the O8 stone.]
;W[mj];B[lk]C[This isn't as immediately threatening as the last two moves, and so white gets a chance to get his own nastiness in at M7. This falls under the general category of ``If a ladder works, it's great for the attacker, but if it fails to kill, then it's horrible, because of all the cut points it leaves.'' A friend of mine related a proverb to me that states that the only thing in Go is understanding ladders.]
;W[lm];B[lj];W[mi];B[gj]C[What does this have to do with the task at hand? Still better is P3-O2-S5-S4.]
;W[ro];B[so];W[ln];B[li]C[Another move to consider in corralling these white stones would be O11.]
;W[mh];B[oq];W[nr];B[or];W[nq];B[mp];W[mr];B[po];W[qn];B[rl]
;W[no];B[op];W[qs]C[I'm not sure about this move for white. The best response for black is to ignore the two black stones and play P6. If white P7, then the play is Q7-P5-P7 and the white group is toast.
This sacrifice position is similar to one frequently encountered in killing three stones, with white stones say at J8-K8-L8 and K10, and black stones at H9-H8-J7-K7-L7-M8-M9. Black plays K9 and kills.]

;B[oo];W[rp];B[qs];W[pr];B[pq];W[lf]C[Wow. Seki.];B[lh];W[mg]
;B[lg];W[nf];B[me];W[ne];B[le];W[ld];B[ke];W[qg]C[Whit does a nice job of saving his N stones here.]
;B[qh];W[oi];B[qf];W[ng];B[rg];W[ir];B[jr];W[jq];B[iq];W[kq]
;B[hr];W[il];B[jl];W[im];B[in];W[jm];B[kp]C[Okay. Prevents white's second eye locally, but white's next move shows he has another option. I would prefer supporting G10, to make sure white stayscut in the middle. Then he has to live locally, and black can attack the other side of the G11 stone to kill it, and get something out of the G10 play.]
;W[hj];B[fj];W[hi];B[gb]C[Nice solid endgame move. It's getting to be that time, but I still am a bit worried about the height of black's left side.]
;W[fb];B[gh];W[hh];B[fh];W[ig];B[jg];W[cl];B[cn];W[cj];B[ci]
;W[bi];B[ck];W[ch];B[bj];W[bg];B[ai]C[Ko is not what you want here, especially facing a stronger player. I would rather not give white the option, and would play a safe confining move at B14.]
;W[ah];B[bh];W[rm];B[sm];W[bi];B[qe];W[aj];B[ak];W[cf];B[be]
C[It's too late to take life away from these white stones, because white is threatening to play D13, either making two eyes or connecting out. Black playing the peep at D13 is more interesting, because if white plays B15, then after cutting him off from the corner group you threaten to mess with his B12 vacancy. As a bonus, of course, D13 strengthens the D16 to E12 connection.]
