C[I'm Brad playing white.  Thanks for reviewing the game.];B[dq]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[qd];B[ec]TR[ci][cj][dn][co][do]C[Olof: Normaly in this position you play on the left side, either in the center (C10 or C11) to prevent black from playing there. Or you play an kakari (approach) on the lower corner (C5, D5 or D6) to prevent another shimari (corner enclosure).]
;W[oc];B[dj];W[pj];B[kq];W[mq]TR[jc][jd][co][do]C[Olof: This move feels too slow for me. I think you need to either take the big point at k16/k17 or a kakari on the lower left corner.]
;B[ko];W[mo]C[Olof: Another slow move.];B[jj]TR[co][do]C[Olof: This is a misstake by black I think, it's a nice moyo sure but if he had played C5/D5 the game would have almost been over.]

Olof: Hmm maybe you could try a contact move on E17, E18 perhaps. But you need to be careful, the center groups still only got one eye (see var).]

Brad (W:O): 104.5 to Raspoutine (B:#): 105.0
Game is completed.

Olof: A few pointers. First there are people who invade the opponents terr as soon as he might get some, trying to make sure he never gets any terr, and then there are those that never invade. You (and your opponent too) are the second kind. You wait and wait and then you finaly invade it's already too late.
The timing of an invasion is one of the hardest things in the game but try to do it a little earlier next time.

Maybe some opening theory study could help you, there are two nice books about this, "In The Beginning" the first book in the Elementry Go Series, all the books the that series is good. And "501 Opening problems"

Second: One of the most important things is to keep your stones connected, you let your self be cut in the lower left corner, that was most likely the loosing move. The proverbs say that you should connect out before building eyes, if you hade connected them maybe you would only have gotten one eye on the side, but that is most of the time ok, you get one eye on the side and then one in there center (or connect to some over group).

Third: do not always answer black that ever he plays. You need to play tenuki more, move 10, 12, 16, 86 and 114 are all examples of times there tenuki would probobly been better. But I shouldn't be too hard on you for this, the reason the game became as close as it got in the end was because black were a lot worse then you at this.]
