C[hello !
my name is jero. i'm french and it is the first time i use your website to review one of my games.
well, in this game i'm playing with blacks and my opponent is GnuGO at his strongest level.

As i am only a beginner (i've played around 35 games) i would like to know where i did some very big mistakes.

what i would like to know more precisely is
about the limit when you must stop making/expanding territory.

i'd like to know more about how to defend my territories at the same time even if it is necessary sometimes to sacrifice some stones or some corners.

and finally i suppose there are some classic forms that allow  a better way to protect or attack, forms that i'd like to learn.

(and eventually if you had one book to suggest to me in order  to learn go and improve my game it would be very interesting.)

Thank You very much for paying attention to this game.

Gregor: Hello Jero, I'm Gregor from Austria.I'll do my best answering your questions, but I always feel, I'm at the beginning of Go als well als you. So I want to apologize for my poor understanding and my hints that may be wrong.]
;B[dd];W[qp];B[qd];W[pl];B[dp];W[od]C[i played Q14 because i thought about the big territory gnuGo would have made if i had not played there. but i don't know if it was very clever when looking at the end.]
;B[pf]C[Gregor: It's a good move, its joseki-play. Joseki means certain patterns which occur often in the beiginning, especially in the corners. There are lots of books about it an it's nice to study them.]
;W[qc]C[what i was thinking about here is that i don't want to let him this corner and the whole top of the board.]
;B[pc];W[pd]C[here i played R18 because i didn't  want to lose stone 9 because i think it would have help to prevent whites from making more territory here. but i actually don't know if it was a good idea.]

(;B[qb]C[Gregor: b11 at s17 would be joseki. Look at variations]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[pb];B[oc];W[rb]C[Gregor: Now w lives in the corner and both b groups are not very strong. Its difficult to defend two weak groups at the same time.]
;B[ob];W[qa]C[there i tried to threaten Q18 hoping that GnuGo would respond with R18. so that's what it did which alllowed me to "expand" O17.]

(;B[nc]C[Gregor: b19 at o17 is too slow better extend to n17. See variations.
Another idea may be to attack w two stones at pq16. I'll try. See variations.]
;W[qe];B[qf]C[here with R10 i already think that i'd better try to prevent white from spreading his influence on the whole right of the board.
but actually i already feel trapped somehow because i have no idea about how to make a territory in the "middle" of the right side.]
;W[re]
(;B[md]C[here i want to expand my territory but fearing the invasion so may be i've not played "big" enough. (N16)
Gregor: the extension would be better at the 3rd or 4th line. Look.]

(;W[fc]
(;B[ee]C[i didn't know what to defend : the top of the board where whites are already building or the left where there is no white which represent a huge territory to make.
i did this way even if the i think the left side is easier to invade since it's bigger.

and that's exactly my problem : i don't know what choice to make.
Gregor: here perhaps a squeeze would be better. b25 at j17 would help the black group in the right upper corner and attack w f17 at the same time. See variations.]
;W[ic];B[kc]C[
Gregor: b27 at l17 seems good to me!];W[dn]
(;B[ep]C[i find E4 not very brillant from me certainly because of my lack of experience and self confidence.
but know it appears to me easierto isolate for whites.
Gregor: b29 at e4 is too slow. better make a 1-point jump to the right or play another squeeze.  It would even be possible to play elswere. See variations.]
;W[op]
(;B[gp]C[Gregor: b31 at g4 is too slow too. Look.];W[iq]C[what could i have played to answer J3 ? i think my move made white easy to defend and make territory.]
;B[hq];W[ip]C[and here i alreadi feel like powerless to invade the territory of J3 ,J4 , P4 , R4.
Gregor: Invasion now is very difficult, perhaps impossible, I dont know. But there are some ways to attack w. I try some. See variations.]

(;B[fn];W[qi]C[Gregor: R11 is really a big point, because now the two b stones have to run into the center and w is making a huge teritorry at the lower left.]
;B[oh]C[with P12 i don't want to let him expand to the center and at the same time it allows me possibilities to invade the center later.]
;W[db]
(;B[bd]C[Gregor: here b39 at c17 would be better and gain you more territory. Look.]
;W[in]
(;B[oj]C[Gregor: there are still big points at the left side. I'd prefer to play here first. for Example:]
;W[ml];B[ol];W[om]C[there begins a fight that i've lost later. i wanted to break a part of the territory at the bottom of the board.
 Gregor: I think the fight to reduce w's terrytory is too early. Don't forget the left side!]

(;B[nm]C[Gregor: b45 is overplay: it wants to achieve too much. and the it get's lost - with no use. Perhaps better try to invade the left side. I'll try:]
;W[ok];B[mm];W[lm];B[nl];W[nk]C[i think my mistake was that i wanted so much to invade the territory that i forgot connexion.
it is not exactly that i forgot but i thought that even without the help of stone 41 i could have made a stable group there.
actually i couldn't as you can already guess surely because that was not the way to do it.
Gregor: I think, is rather difficult for b to live in this area.]
;B[mk];W[ll];B[nj]C[so i tried to make caps with O9 and P9 to connect. but it was surely too easy to guess.]
;W[pk]
(;B[lk]C[Gregor: o15 is a big point, becous w can develope into the center. If b takes it, then w ist cut off the center. Watch:]
;W[ne];B[mf];W[ck]
(;B[dl]C[Gregor: good idea to reduce w territory, bur i'd rather make an extension from the corner above. See variations:]
;W[cl]C[at this moment my mind was not clear and
so i left the left side thinking that i'd better break the bottom territory..
but know considering the way i tried i think i should have concentrate more on the left of the board.]
;B[mo];W[co]C[Gregor: GNU ignores b61 - no possibility to live here.]

(;B[nn];W[ln];B[pn];W[pp];B[pm];W[kp];B[np];W[nq];B[lp];W[kq]
;B[mq];W[bq]C[Gregor: now w has made a big extension in the lower left corner. See variations.]
;B[cq];W[br];B[cr];W[nr];B[lq];W[il];B[jj];W[hr];B[gr]C[at this moment i've already decided that i would try to make territory
on the left side at the top of the board
in the center.];W[ie]C[and with J15 i feel my plan is a bit compromised and so i try to prevent white from invading the center from both the bottom and the top of the board.
Gregor: usually the territory in the center is not as big as estimated at the first glance. Better establish at the sides first. look.]

(;B[hk];W[dj]C[now my territory on the left is much reduced and i feel it's time to stabilize there.
Gregor: stailization here is really very urgent.];B[dh];W[ig]
;B[kg];W[kl];B[kk];W[bi];B[bh];W[ci];B[ch];W[el];B[bb]C[Gregor: Still i think c17 would be better.]

thank you for your commentary.


Gregor: I think, you played quite well. The group in the lower right corner could have been alive - as i realized myself in analysing the moves ov GNU. In the beginning you should concentrate at the corners, the at the sides and then develope into the center. But in the center the territory to gain is rather small.
For a book you can try "38 Basic Joseki" from the Elementry Go series, Vol. 2, Ciseido Publishing Company.
Thank you for letting me reviewing your game!])
