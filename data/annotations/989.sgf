cory@olga.net  (black) vs. the computer  (TurboGo v4.01, Stronger/slow
mode).   Jan 7-8, 2000.

This was my first (winning) game against the computer on a 19x19
board.
I've given my intentions in comments during the game -- I'd like
the reviewer  to comment on my overall strategies (as well as whatever else
seems  important).];B[cq];W[dc];B[qq]C[Seems that this (and C3) are too cautious --  actually, I'd characterize mo
st of the first half of this game overly cautious (on black's
part).

Variety is good.  Playing one 3x3 point is fine, but you should
try another place in your other corner.  Playing the 4x4 point
is good practice for games where you receive a handicap.  A 3x4
point is also a good choice.

A 4x4 point does NOT take the corner,  it is used to reach down
the sides and into the center.  An opponent can always invade
at the 3x3 point behind you and take the corner.

A 3x4 point partially secures the corner and partially influences
the edge and center.

A 3x3 point only takes the corner.];W[qd];B[po]TR[dj][dk][pj]
[pk][ip][jp][kp]SQ[jd]MA[ce][oc][gc][gd][pg][qg][df][nd]C[Too conservative a move at this point in the game?

Yes.  You should play an approach move or extend much further
down a side.  Some possible approach moves are marked with Xs
and some side extensions with triangles.  The square would also
be a good point to play.];W[qj];B[qk]TR[pg][qg]MA[ql]C[Don't play a contact move here.  Either block at X or invade
at one of the triangles.  A contact fight would allow white to
solidify the upper right side.  White chose to play elsewhere,
but see the variation starting next move]
(;W[fp];B[ep]MA[ip]C[A pincer at X is better.  It takes advantage of black's strength
in the lower right corner.  White can't take the lower left corner
and playing at X leaves no room for white to expand along the
lower side.];W[oc];B[kp]TR[ip][jp][iq]MA[ce][df]C[Would this have been better played near D10?

Yes D10 is better.  Approach moves against the upper left corner
are also still very good.  If you want to play on the lower side,
play one or two spaces closer to white.];W[qg];B[dh]C[Bolder --  but I was worried that this would turn out to be a dumb  move.

This is vague.  It is a bit too far up to be an extension from
the lower corner and a bit too far down to be an approach move.]
;W[cl];B[dn]MA[cf][cj][ce]C[The corner is more secure than the stone on the left side.  You
would be better off if you make a base for it with something
like one of the Xs];W[jc];B[hq];W[gc];B[dl];W[ce];B[cj]C[Was able to connect D12 to the rest of the group -- this was
a relief.

Things seem to be shaping up nicely for black -- although white
hasn't been challenged at all yet.

The score is about equal, but white has two stones that could
be used to invade and reduce black's territory while black has
no invasions underway.];W[ld];B[qm];W[rk];B[rl];W[pk];B[ql]
;W[pj];B[rj];W[ri];B[sj]C[Trying for my first eye  -- I want this group to live.]
;W[pl];B[sk];W[si];B[sl]C[This move is not necessary.  If white plays here you can capture
at T7.  In general, this group was never is much danger.  It
could always fall back to the corner if really pressed.  Thus,
spending the two extra moves to make an eye doesn't add to its
security while white has made a nice outside wall in exchange.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[em];B[ck];W[bl];B[rn]TR[cm]MA[cn]C[This group is pretty much guaranteed life now, I think.

It is too soon to leave the contact fight on the left side.  Once you have entered a contact fight, don't stop until your
groups are all secure or dead.  Secure means 5 liberties or at
least 2 more liberties than your opponent.  A white cut at X
captures the marked stone and make a large hole in black's side
formation.  You should play at X here];W[dk];B[pm]C[Probably not necessary.

This doesn't add much to the right side group and allows white
to cut apart the left side.];W[el];B[nm]TR[dj]MA[cn]C[Probably even less necessary.  Should this have been played on
the other side of the board -- against the D8-centered white
group?

Yes.  X is still a good move.  The triangle is also good.];W[bm]
;B[cn];W[en];B[eo];W[fo];B[fq]C[White seems to be taking a huge chunk out of black's  lower-left corner.]
;W[ho];B[ln]TR[cm][cn][dn][eo][ep]MA[do]C[The contact fight in the lower left side is still not stable.
The X is an important connection.  Currently black has two groups
with only 3 liberties each.  See the variation starting next
turn for a way to take advantage of this.]
(;W[bk];B[dj];W[bj];B[bi];W[ai];B[ah];W[bn];B[bo];W[ef]
(;B[aj]MA[cf]C[This is not necessary.  Black needs more eye space here.  X is
better.  See the variation];W[ak];B[ai];W[ej];B[ei]C[Doesn't seem to be enough room here  to make two eyes, but I'll try  anyhow.

When you think there isn't enough room, you need to stretch out
in some direction to get more room.  In general, consider going
toward a corner first, along a side second and out into the middle
last];W[eg];B[eh];W[cg]C[This move destroys a lot of black's potential.]
;B[ch];W[bg]
(;B[ng]C[This stone was played in order to  connect with ladders starting from R11 *or* F6 -- neither of
them end up working, though.

The group on the left side is still not secure.  It is too soon
to leave it and play elsewhere unless you have decided to write
it off.  It still has potential.  See the variation.];W[qi]
;B[gp];W[go];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm]C[Trying to either connect via ladder to  O13 (getting me a huge piece of the center board), connect with
the stranded  black group at F11 or capture white groups G5 or E7.]
;W[gm]TR[ng]C[So much for the  ladder -- I'm tryin
g to make my way up to the E11 group now.

You can't expect your opponent to start a ladder here after you
played a ladder-breaker.  You should have expected this response
to your cut when you played the marked stone];B[fl];W[fk];B[gl]
;W[hl];B[gk];W[fj];B[hk]C[Change of tactics -- I'm trying to capture the G7  group.]
;W[hm]
(;B[in]TR[gi]MA[jl][jk]C[Either X cuts white off better.  Basically, decide where white
would like to run and put a stone in the way.  Your move implies
that white will want to run towards your strong lower right corner.

Also, see the variation starting at the triangle.  This is a
"net" that catches the whole white left side group.

Contact fights are not the best way to kill stones.  Play at
a distance to surround and kill.  None of the places I have marked
here touches a white stone, but all are deadly];W[jl];B[il]

(;W[gj]TR[hl][hm][gm][gn][go][ho][fo][fp]MA[im]C[White should play at X.  This mistake ends up killing the marked
white group.  See the variation];B[ik];W[im];B[jm];W[km];B[jn]
;W[kn];B[io];W[ko];B[hp];W[jo];B[hn];W[jp];B[kl]C[I hope to split the L6 group off  from the rest of the white board and smother it.  This means
I have to keep it  from the G10 and Q10 groups.];W[mk];B[lo]

playing at X.]

;W[lk]
(;B[jq]MA[gh]C[While I was busy trying to  kill a probably dead group, white built a wall well inside what
I had  considered black territory.  I should have been more careful.

The center has never "belonged" to anyone prior to this.  Now,
white's center needs to be reduced right away.  I would start
the reduction from the black group on the left side, since it
needs to expand into the center anyway for eyespace.  X is a
good start.  See the variation for one possible sequence.];W[kk]
;B[gh]TR[ek][dl]C[I'm trying to connect groups E12 and H9, hopefully capturing
some of the white mess near E10.  In order for white to save
the E10 group it would have to sacrifice the E9 liberty.

Both of the marked spaces are false eyes.  White only has one
eye on the edge.  This white group is in trouble and attacking
from the direction of 121 will allow black to expand the left
side group while harassing the white stones.]
(;W[hf]MA[hi]C[White should play at X to escape.  Playing this move at 122 kills
white's left side.  See the variation.];B[hj];W[hi];B[gi]TR[bn]

C[The marked white stones are now cut off and dead.  White should
not waste any more stones on this group and should turn to other
parts of the board];W[ek]MA[hh]C[This is a wasted move for white.   Playing at X helps white make
more center territory.];B[am]C[Wanted to make sure that white couldn't make two eyes here --
otherwise it's B9 group would be alive (and filling in D8 would
keep  the F10 glob alive).  Actually, it seems to me that this was
unnecessary -- white didn't have e
nough room to make two eyes in this spot.   Oops.];W[an];B[ao]
;W[dg]
(;B[fi]MA[ii]C[This move is not necessary.  White is dead even without this
move.  Move into the center instead.  See the variation for one
possibility.];W[al]C[another wasted move by white]
(;B[nq]C[Noticed a huge gap over in the  lower right corner -- wanted to prevent white from putting a
group  here.

I don't think an invasion can succeed.  See the variation.  If
you are not sure about the invasion, however, this move is prudent.
Since black is winning, conservative moves are in order.];W[fg]
;B[hh]C[Trying to make my way slowly over to the O13 st
one (or optionally down to the J9 group, although that isn't
necessary, since  the white E9 group is dead.];W[ii];B[ij]MA[ig]
C[This makes a thick clump and doesn't really advance your reduction
of the center.  X is better.];W[jj];B[ll]C[This move is worth less than reducing the center further.]
;W[ji];B[gg];W[gf];B[ih]TR[hg]MA[ig]C[Move out with a diagonal move like X instead.  White can't cut
it off.  If white plays at at 143, black plays at the triangle
to connect.  If white plays at the triangle, then black plays
at 143.];W[jh];B[ig];W[if];B[jg]C[Still  trying to save the lone black at O13 -- with the added bonus
of stealing points  from white along the way.];W[lf];B[jf];W[je]

is well worth the one prisoner.];B[lh];W[ni];B[lj];W[og];B[mj]
;W[nj];B[ke]C[More sneaky one-step advances -- probably doesn't really help
in the Grand Scheme of Things.

Each of these moves reduces white's score, so they are worth
doing at this point.];W[kd];B[ag];W[bh];B[kj]C[Was hoping that I'd be able to fill in L13, L14, L15 and O9 --
but I knew it was a long shot.

The are all Dame points anyway.  Filling them doesn't change
the score for either player.];W[af];B[ci]C[Nearly lost the A12 group.

It is important to remain aware of all your groups that have
only 2 or 3 liberties.  Eventually you will have to capture the
white stones on the left since your large left side group will
run out of liberties.];W[bf];B[mp]C[Not necessary];W[kh];B[kg]
C[Another important connection you should not miss.  It is easy
to start playing too fast at this point and miss a critical connection.]
;W[nf]C[Not necessary for white to do this];B[dl]C[Thought I was running out of liberties -- this move probably
wasn't really necessary at the time, though.

There are only dame points left, so it is fine to capture this
now.];W[nk];B[lq]C[Not necessary.];W[pe]C[Not necessary.];B[hg]
;W[fh];B[ki];W[fd]C[Not necessary.];B[tt]C[Did I pass too early?   Should I have placed some stones along the 2 line?

Passing now is good.  You should not be able to invade anywhere
on the upper side.  It doesn't really hurt to try, but white
would have to really play poorly for you to succeed.];W[cb]
