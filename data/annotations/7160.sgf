C[Hello,

I will do my best to review the following game for you. I will try to give special attention to the opening as you have requested. If you have any questions about this review or want further help, feel free to contact me on KGS. I go by the name of Talaer on that server.

My comments will begin with T:

Thanks,
Tim


General Questions I have:

I messed up in fuseki, at what point did it go wrong, what did i miss?]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[po];B[np];W[qk]C[T: W should probably play the normal move of R3 to prevent your corner from being too large while settling his group.]
;B[oc]C[T: Maybe threaten W at R5 or R11 first. This gives him the opportunity to strengthen his group.]
;W[qh]C[T: W does strengthen but is still not perfect and again took gote while gaining few points.]
;B[ip]C[T: I do not think it is correct to focus on this side right now. One move here, like this one, cannot seal in the side from invasion, so it is probably best to still focus on the corners.]
;W[cj];B[fd]C[is it better from the other side?
did i miss an other big point?
should I have gone lower (F17)?

T: I think I would prefer F17 here, especially since W decided to play C10 instead of D10. This move should still be okay, though.]
;W[id]C[T: I looked at some various josekis for patterns like this one to see what would be best for black. D14 may be worth attempting in order to prevent W from getting a very large corner.]

(;B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[ce];B[gc]LB[hc:B][hd:A]C[G17 feels small, but also stable, I did not want to play  A or B

T: Yes, it is hard to find a move here that feels good. Since the corner is settled and an attack on C10 is harder now, the main goal should be to try to affect J16. Jumping out may be a good move to start that attack while keeping W's influence under control. B does still have C18 to gain eyespace.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[rq]C[T: Normally W draws back to R4 instead of S3. This gives you a chance to protect Q2 by playing Q4 as a forcing move.]

(;B[cn]LB[dn:C][oq:A][or:B]C[Should I have protected at A or B?
Better High Pincer at C?

T: Yes, I think protecting the bottom right is important right now. You do not want to risk getting split into two weak groups on the bottom.]
;W[fp]LB[fo:C][gp:B][cq:A]C[Should i have played A instead of B?
Black B, white C weakens the stone at C6, right?];B[gp];W[fo]

(;B[cp]C[T: After your last moves, you must either play E3, or C3. This one helps W get stronger while leaving your groups somewhat weak.]
;W[cq];B[do];W[eq];B[gq];W[bp];B[co];W[fm];B[bo];W[aq];B[eo]
;W[ep];B[cl]C[something went wrong here, i pincered the corner, but white is alive and running and
i've got a weak group....

T: Yes, this is a difficult situation for you now. W will likely gain enough points to win as a result of the weak groups that have been formed.]
;W[ek];B[dk];W[dj];B[el];W[ck];B[fl];W[dl];B[dm];W[bl];B[dk]
;W[kp]C[T: This is a painful move to deal with.];B[dl];W[mc]

(;B[kc]C[T: I don't think you should be aggressive like this at the moment. You don't want W to be able to build any more influence on the board. Strengthening your groups on the bottom should be a high priority.]
;W[le]
(;B[ic];W[hn];B[jo];W[bm]C[that hurt me, because i saw that weakness and wanted to protect it. At that time
i decided there were greater/bigger/ more important points, was i wrong?]
;B[hl];W[lo];B[mr]C[is there a better way to stabilize and connect the two bottom groups
?

would it better be to run into the center?

T: I have shown some variations previously.];W[no];B[jq];W[km]
C[T: W is gaining a lot of influence on the board now by attacking your groups. While handling these groups, you will see that it is too hard to effectively reduce W's points.]
;B[pp]C[i wanted to create a weakness, to reduce Whites center]
;W[qo]
(;B[oh]C[is this the right point to reduce?

T: It could be a hard fight it is not able to quickly connect back to other black stones. Maybe first try some forcing moves against W's top stones before playing this move.]
;W[oe]C[T: Instead, W gets to apply the same idea to you.];B[pf]
;W[pg];B[og];W[of];B[qf];W[lh];B[qi]C[lucky me to get this spot to play,

what does M12 accomplish?

T: Good move. M12 does still effect your weak group while getting W's top one further into the center.]

(;W[hp];B[en];W[hq]C[T: Although, W may have done better to let your group live while flattening your points on the bottom.]

[ks][ms][ns][os]C[T: You started the very beginning of the game with a slight advantage, but ended up losing because of weak groups that were created over time. After I play a game, if I have questions about variations in the corner, I will consult www.eidogo.com to see if I played incorrectly or if there would have been a better way. Don't try to focus too hard on memorizing joseki from it though, just compare the situations that you played and try to learn from them so that you can do better in your next game.

With your opening style, you should try to get very solid opening positions so that later you can spare creating a weak group when you need to reduce your opponent's influence. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions about this game. Feel free to message me on KGS anytime if I am online. If I have spare time, I may even be able to play a game with you.

Thanks,
Tim])
