C[Hi, I'm black in this game that I won, but would have lost with proper komi.

I left a bunch of questions and remarks for various moves, and I'm mostly interrested to see if my self review is right.

I also would like to see if my multiple sacrifice in yose were any good.

Thanks a lot !

===

My comments come after the "===".

There is an overview at the end.

I also used this review as an excuse to procrastinate, so there's alot of stuff here. Some of the longer variations just go into the intuition as to why there's aji in a situation, and not meant to be how far you should read.

You played well, but you gave up many points from when the game entered yose.]

See prior move. This move is fine and puts the situation into a more familiar relm of joseki.

For reference, joseki is white D6 from here.]

(;B[cc];W[cd]C[===

This is certainly big territorially, and the exchange is profit for you, but you may also want to consider holding this in reserve. After this exchange, white's left side is more solid than before it. If you had wanted to activate C6, or invade at D12, it is considerably harder now. The cash may be worth it, even this early, but I want to make sure you're aware that you're also helping white remove aji.]
(;B[fe]C[Trying to reduce his side, and build the top, but it's probably to open. Would a move around J16 be better ?

S3 is very important. This is especially the case with white's powerful ponnuki at k3 bearing down on black's corner. If that corner comes under attack, then it will be very difficult on black, who will likely get covered. White will get even more influence to use for the center.]

This is true, but it's a pretty pricey exchange at that, the corner couldn't be less than 40 points, as all that's now black's territory.

Black just has to simplify the game and coast to a win.]
;W[qj]
(;B[pj]C[I don't know the proper move here. Was connecting under better ?

===

Yes. Basically, white has influence out there to attack you with. You'd rather settle and live locally, than run out, and have white actually be able to use his influence. There's a difference between solidifying yourself by adding power towards the middle, and having to run for life.

Living is your only concern, the center is too small, even if white gets all of it.]

This move is sente, but that doesn't mean it's good for you. This will always be here later if you want to make it later, but playing it now removes a liberty from you.

;W[ge];B[ie];W[gf];B[eb]
(;W[jg];B[jd];W[kh];B[ic]C[This felt bigger than defending the two stones.

===

The two stones are worth 5 points right off the bat (4 for capture, +1 for K12) Furthermore they set up N13, which is a 4 point gote move for either side. Either side has a 50/50 chance of getting it, so that's considered a further 2 points. So it's about 7 points, plus a tiny bit more depending on what happens if white also captures n12.

J17 is big, probably worth it, so I think you're correct, but I wanted to make sure you knew that M11 is also valuable, maybe more-so than it seems.]
;W[lh]
(;B[qb]C[===

This move is odd, it's like S18, but worth a few points less. See the variation for a way to count it.]
;W[kf];B[le]C[same Idea. The two stones are 4 pts gote if I count well.

===

You mean N12? It's immediately 4 points, but there's the M14 gote followup which both sides have a 50/50 chance of getting. M14 has even more risky dangerous business, and at the very least white can then push at L15 in sente for a point. So the value is more like 6.5 or so. Still, I'm not saying that you choosing not to save them is bad, but it's worth more than you think.]
;W[mg]
(;B[kr]C[still the same idea. In the end, it was probably a little too much ?

===

Again, there are weaknesses left behind after white M14. That being said, L2 is pretty big. BTW, S1 would be sente if black had more ko threats. S1 would be worth about 6 points then, as white r1 is sente for him.

Also, if the G8 area was left as it was with all the potential threats, then S1 would certainly be dangerous for white to ignore.]
;W[lf];B[oe];W[ke];B[ld]C[===

So you see that it was more than just 4 points.];W[hd]C[===

Now, K15 is 6 points. S1 is also 6, but S1 is more interesting for you, as you can set up a ko later. The threat of a ko later would possibly cause white to have to at some time come back to fix it, as black's O10 ko threats aren't going away. See variation.]
(;B[je];W[ja]LB[ha:2][ka:1][jb:3]TR[ib]SQ[kb]C[===

So, in short, to handle a monkey jump, there are usually 3 standard moves. They are numbered in their preferred order. Sometimes triangle can be used, and sometimes you just have to play square. J17 is very rarely a good call. There are sometimes cases, but it should be considered last.

Here 1 and 2 don't work, so you can go with 3. See variation.]
(;B[ia];W[ib];B[jb];W[ha];B[ka]C[===

Also, if white wants to end in sente, white can stop here, glad that he reduced black in sente. He can come back to fill the ko later  after he's taken some other big sente points, such as R1.]
;W[ia]C[===

The difference is that white can play H17 for a point later. The ko is big enough that it would probably be sente later on, so we should count H18 as an assured point for white. Also, K17 is certainly not a point for black now, while in the other variation it had a chance of being one. So that's 1.5 points difference, plus one because white captured a stone. 2.5 points overall difference to the variation. 

But you also have to add in whatever might happen if white tenuki instead of J19, as that ko isn't worth filling yet with juicy sente like R1. The difference might be larger, as white could play bigger moves before J19.

If you're more interested in monkey jumps, Guo Juan's website has two lectures on them (the first explains responses, the second is more so just problems and examples). It's probably worth the $1 (well, 1 euro) price. There is also a book I believe on them, but I'm not familiar with it.

Now that white can live locally, this isn't worth anything.]
;W[oo];B[no]
(;W[so]C[===

So you played P6 and O5, which didn't reduce white's points, and white played T5 then, which increased his points. Also, white could of played T6 to actually reduce you too, with R6 being a further point with a threat of a ko for more points. All in all you would lose a few point through all this.]
;B[sn];W[mo];B[qn]C[free move for white. I miscounted white liberties on the bottom.

In an overview:

You took territory while giving influence, which is perfectly valid. However, there were several times where you could of made a different move to accomplish the same purpose that would help counter white's influence, but didn't go for it. That might be a lack of whole-board sight or thinking. Later on, you had a comfortable lead, but started getting jealous of white's center, even though it was small. You even made some desperate moves to try to reduce it further, but those got cut off losing you many points. Not only did those get cut off, but they paved the way for white to make many reductions and small captures. Through that, and other miscellaneous mistakes In the endgame, you gave up about 20+ points of your lead.

Key points to work on:

1) Think and see more in the whole board. If there's multiple moves to accomplish the same purpose, try to find ones that have a more global value, such as helping with the balance of power.

2) Don't get so jealous of your opponent's territory even when it is not enough, but try to count and maintain the balance.

3) Study more of the endgame, or else be more careful. One of the elementary series of go books is on the endgame, and you might find it valuable.]

(;B[jr]C[===

White is 1 point smaller, and you'll still get L1 later. Furthermore, K1 is sente for you, so you'll probably get it right away. If white takes it, it's gote and you'll just snatch up one of the other gote moves that's worth points.]

))
(;B[rb]TR[sd][re][se]C[===

Bigger than R18. 3 points or more difference actually. Let's count it.

Like this, white can hope to get no more than 2-3 points around the triangles. If black played R18 instead of S18, it would be the same if black came back to turn at S18, but there's a good chance white will get S18 for himself. If that's the case, then white immediately gets 1 more point of territory. Also, white S18 sets up R19 sente, which is worth 3 points in sente.

Let's go over that again, if black R18, then S18 is gote for both sides. Let's simplify and say both sides have a 50/50 chance of getting it. S18 decides if white gets T17 as a point, so that's 1 for now. White S18 makes R19 sente, so white will waste no time in taking the sente 4 points (2 territory for him, minus 2 for black). If black blows sente to make up for this, white gets a gote move elsewhere of comparable value. Now, look at black having S18. He's probably going to get R19 as a point, so that brings the total value to 6 points difference between black S18 and R18, to go to whoever get S18. So it's 3 points if you think that either side has a 50/50 chance at it.]

Here is very large. It's hard to say, but white will have a hard time making enough out of the center. If we were to go back in time and place R7 at P9, E13 at F13, and other very minor changes, then this certainly seems the way to go. This is a good example of the slight differences and minor points. 

For example, with R7, you wanted to secure a group, which is a good idea. Globally you would like to do so by making some power for yourself, to help balance out white's monopoly on influence.

If I were black in this game, I would play here, and sort of dare white to make enough out of the center. Also, J14 is also a little oddly placed now, it's a little too deep to be for the purpose of white forming a moyo. In fact, it may come under attack - if white tries to run with it he'll destroy his center.]

Let's say black takes it one further, and further dares white to make enough. Black still has enough reduction techniques to make it close.]

Black has this, if white tries to seperate, it seems doubtful that white can kill black. Let's see it out some.]

When white splits, you're a bit stronger than without the B6 A5 exchange. Granted, this takes away your endgame move at A5, so you should weigh that in too.]

A jump is simpler, and simplifying for you (since you have a comfortable and sizable territorial lead) is probably a good idea.]

White can invade your top still, but it's more difficult and even with it, you should get able to erase his center in the process, possibly setting yourself to do something with the lower left.]

(;B[ok]TR[ng][og][dj][pn][eo][gp][hp][ip][jq]C[===

Jumping out is also viable. The good thing about this is that it serves to hamper white utalizing his influence. P9 solidifies you and helps break into the white ring of influence that was forming. Furthermore, it makes a black turn at N13, soon, feel like there's a little more pressure.]

Now this is much more difficult after the C17 C16 exchange. White can attack it very vigorously.

Later, or even now, you can invade. This has the advantage that it's not just an invasion, it's an attack that splits off white D14. This can also be used to later activate c6. You may not want to do this now, but this is a possibility you at least might want to keep in store for later.

The rest of this variation is just to show the feasibility of making something here.]

If this result, than this is better for you than if you had played C17 and white had C16. Also, there's still a little aji, as the E14 cut is there for later, meaning that B14 could be big yose for you.]

White has to worry about F11 cuts as well. Anyway, the idea is that there's aji in this position that is greatly reduced when you play C17. You may want to take the cash later and let white eliminate some of the aji, but you might as well leave this open for youself for now.]
