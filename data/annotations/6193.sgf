C[Hi Maelic
Hope the review helps, 
since your biggest concern is keeping the huge moyo you were able to build ill focus on that, but I may have a few comment on you opening and early middle game
Ill start my comments with S:
Sleep667 (on kgs)
Jack Merritt 1k];B[dd]C[Zed0 [14k\]: hi there];W[qp]C[Zed0 [14k\]: enjoy the game :)]
;B[cq]C[maelic [13k\]: hello you too];W[oc];B[dj];W[jc];B[fc]
;W[qi]C[S: this move doesnt work well with the p 17 stone, the 3-5  stone aims for the side and center rather than the corner while r11 is very territory based.  also notice every one of your stones is on the third line.  this opening normally shouldnt give you much in the center (even though black let you have it anyway)
see var.]
(;B[oq];W[op];B[np];W[oo];B[nq];W[no];B[mp]C[S:horrible move for black  (i know this review is for white but cant help but say the two space jump to L4 is safer and more efficient 
n4 did nothing];W[mo];B[lo];W[ln];B[ko];W[kn];B[qq]
(;W[hm]C[S:you are right to tenuki, but the large knights move ignores a serios weakness in blacks stones
see var.];B[hn];W[in];B[io]

;W[di];B[cj]
(;W[cf]C[S: so black has not invaded your incrediable moyo a stronger palyer would have invaded long before this point but this is not a review for black

c14 does not accomplish much, it maqkes no territory because of the c10 stone, it does not threaten the d16 group because it can either mak abase with h17 or jump into the center, 

Black is solid all around , but white has weakness so how abot spend a movev and fix them
see var
much of your trouble later came as a result of your weakness now]
;B[dh];W[eh];B[ch];W[dg];B[cg];W[ef];B[de];W[ee];B[df]C[S: save this stone, it may seem small but it keeps white solidthe threat of e17 is not bigger than black poking his head into whites moyo]
;W[ed];B[eg];W[fg];B[dg]
(;W[gc]C[S: you left a huge weakness at f12, you need to fix it
see var.
 g17 doesnt not work with e16 group at all];B[fh];W[gh]C[S: and the weakness shows itself]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[ei];W[fj];B[ci];W[gf]C[S: good take your loss and fix,]
;B[ec];W[gb];B[fb];W[jo]C[SW: small, notice the upper left corner is still open to invasion, you should fix with some of the ways i mentioned earlier
also g16 is now a weakness it shouls also be fixed, it is not as urgent as a play on the left side though]
;B[jp];W[jn]
(;B[ip]C[S: side note, black did not need to fix here
see var];W[cc]C[S: overplay, white cannot live here, should fix left side]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[db];B[bd];W[fa];B[cb]C[S: black is nice all white is dead if he plays e19]
;W[ea];B[eb];W[ca]C[S: small ko not nearly as big as left side]
;B[da];W[ga]C[S: gave the weakness with g16 , you should fix by playing g16]
;B[ba];W[pq];B[pr];W[pp];B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp];B[sq];W[sp]
;B[sr]C[S: this is small endgame when a corner is still open
 I almost cant believe black hasnt invaded yet]
(;W[li]C[S: good, the right idea but the corner is more urgent and still open]
;B[hl];W[hk];B[il]

[ss]C[Zed0 [14k\]: sorry abotu the messing around at the end
maelic [13k\]: this makes me sad.... thanks for the game
maelic [13k\]: thats ok thats how you learn
Zed0 [14k\]: yeah, thats how I learn, but some people get annoyed by it
Zed0 [14k\]: thanks for the game

S:  you wanted to know how you could have saved your large moyo.  you can do that easily by fixing your fatal weakness before your oponent can take advantage of them. exspecially when you are ahead in territory you can aford to spend a stone to fix a flaw,
You saw firsthand what can happen when you dont

Remember, when you are already ahead. keep it simple. why complicate matters when you are winning, the best way to win a won game is to keep it simple, solid, and strong.  

My only other advice is to keep playing and enjoy the game.  Play often (but not quickly, when you play blitz you only practice your mistakes) I would recomend going over each game for five to ten minutes and see if you see anything that might have worked better. Reviews by stonger players always help and GTL is great for that, Im glad to see you using them

If you ahve any questions I am sleep667 on kgs 
Im on quite often so feel free to ask me anything
hope this helps
