C[Hello, review comments are marked with *. I tried to answer all your questions and give a few more ideas if I saw something. From your comments you seem to have a very negative attitude about this game. No one knows how to find the perfect move, so just play a move that you like - if during review you find a way that your opponent could exploit your move, or you find out that you could have played a better move instead - that's how we learn! so don't worry about being confused and intimidated when you are playing the game.]

(;W[cf]C[P3 or C14 , which move is better ?

*usually b should not play k4 split against two 3-4 corner moves. w can make solid territory with p3. On the other hand, b cannot make a solid enclosure even with one more move c14, so it is not urgent for w to play there]
;B[op];W[po]C[I should play N4 in order to cut the  black K4  ?

*This move is fine. N4 would start a big fight, you can play it, but that's a different game.]
;B[oo];W[pn];B[on];W[pm];B[qj]C[I think black is strong .

*Don't let it bother you. Your goal is to find the best move on the board regardless of who is playing the next move.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ld]C[*L17 is more typical, giving a wider base and less chance for b to undercut, or you can play k16 or k17 and invite the cut if you feel like playing a game with more difficult reading.]
