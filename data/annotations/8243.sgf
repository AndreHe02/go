C[This is a game that I lost recently on KGS.
I was playing black and lost a capturing race in a life and death situation.
The reason that I am sending this game in for review is, because I wasn't sure about my opening during the game. Also during the invasion I was wondering what the best way to play was ... I feel like I'm not very good at defending against invasions.
I left some comments and questions in the sgf.

Thank you for reviewing my game :-)

;B[de]LB[de:A]C[This pincer is not a joseki I know and I played A mostly on first instinct. It was actually played again in the other corner too. What would be good/usual ways to play here for black? Was my move any good?

[Nexik\] Pincer is standard move and your answer is also normal joseki]
;W[ce];B[df];W[cf]C[[Nexik\] Normally white play this way if he wants to play elsewhere]

(;W[ch];B[kc]LB[kd:A]C[Seeing how things went in the lower left corner later, a high counter-pincer at A would probably have worked better here. Is there anything else to consider?

[Nexik\] This move is good.];W[dh]

[Nexik\] Difference is rather simple for your and my level.]

(;B[mk]C[I'm not sure about this move. I first thought I could cut, but quickly realized that I was being too greedy again and that cutting would lead to a very bad fight for me, so I decided to sacrifice this stone to build towards the top right corner. What else would have been good here?

[Nexik\] Yes very bad];W[nk];B[ni];W[lk];B[mi];W[lj];B[mm];W[ml]
;B[pp];W[rq];B[jk];W[qe]C[Here's the invasion. When I first saw it I was sure he would live, but after a few moves it seemed killable. What should my thought process be when I encounter such a move?]
;B[pd]C[I didn't want to fight with a crosscut, it seemed risky.]
;W[qh];B[qj]LB[rl:A]C[I made this move because it blocks his connection while allowing me to connect via S8 in case he lives.]

(;B[pe];W[pf];B[of]LB[pd:A]C[I misread the situation here. I thought I could block him in the corner AND prevent an eye there at the same time, but as you will see in a few moves, I forgot that he could put my A group in atari.]
