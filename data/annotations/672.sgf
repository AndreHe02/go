C[This game is instructive. See comments after move
68.Thanks for the opportunity to look at your game. I hope this review is
helpful.];B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[dq];B[ec];W[cj];B[qj];W[cn]C[a seems like a
standard approach, but black does not like the pincer. For this reason, I
would suggest a move like b (K3).No matter which side white plays, black
has a reasonable follow-up.]
(;B[oq];W[lp]C[white 10 at M4 is a sever pincer
that works well with his bottom shimari.P5 generally needs to have an
attacking meaning to the left because you are giving white territory on the
right, but if you pincer white you will be the one under attack.It is better
to play the simple joseki starting at b
(O4).]
(;B[oo];W[qm];B[qr];W[rr];B[qq];W[rq];B[lr]C[white should play Q4 to
damage black's shape before J3.]
(;W[jq]C[You should play b (Q4)  to
improve your shape.a is a desperate kind of move. White is going to make
territory in the bottom left. You have a weak group on the lower right.
Invading now just makes things worse. What if black plays C12 and following?
Does white's territorial potential seem bigger than
black's?]
(;B[dp];W[cp];B[cq];W[eq];B[co];W[bp];B[ep]C[white a is a mistake.
If he plays b then you cannot hane at F3 and get the good result you got in
the game.]
(;W[do];B[eo];W[bo];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[gq];W[cr]C[Up to
this point, black has gotten a stellar result from his invasion. The two
bottom white stone are cut off between stronger black groups.a (H4) is a
thank-you move. K4 is a point white wants.Black cannot attack white all out,
because both of the black groups are unstable themselves. The sequence
following b (Q4 again), makes the right black group alive and the left
black group stable.White will have a weak group that can be attacked several
times over the course of the game.]
(;B[ip];W[jp]C[R5 looks fancy, but it is
a loss. Q4 gives black better shape and white fewer
points.];B[qo];W[pp];B[op];W[po];B[pn];W[qn];B[pq];W[ro]C[K3 is bad shape as
the game sequence shows. The real problem is that black thinks that he is
strong and white is weak. It is true that white has a weak group, but Black
has two unstable groups.This is not a scenario for an all-out attack, but
Black is trying to kill or maim white.  This is not going to happen.]
;B[kq];W[jr];B[kp];W[ko];B[lo];W[lq]C[Woops! Black is in serious
trouble.];B[kr];W[mr];B[jo];W[kn];B[mq];W[mp];B[np];W[mo];B[nr]
;W[ms];B[ns];W[nq]C[Black manages to get a ko, but white will not answer any
threat.];B[rp];W[mq];B[qo];W[sp];B[qp];W[rm]C[This game is over now. If
white plays solidly, black has no chance.I will end my commentary here.
There are a number of exciting events later in this game, but you can
actually learn enough to make a big jump from just this much.There are two
important lessons in this game:1) Attack from strength. Do not attempt a
killing attack unless you are absolutely alive yourself.2) In the opening,
do NOT invade your opponent's territory while there are still multiple big
points on the board for you to occupy.];B[fm];W[ol];B[ps];W[kc]
