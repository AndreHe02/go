C[RJ: Hi, I'll be reviewing your game.  My comments all start with RJ.

The final outcome of this game was not so much to do with the death of the large black group as with w's control of the game, and consistently larger moves, so although I will spend some time and variations looking at the death of the black group, and some better results you could maybe have achieved in some of your fights, I will also try to point out what moves are bigger for you, and what your opponent was trying to achieve.]

(;B[dg]C[RJ:  See variation];W[cd]
(;B[be]C[RJ: See variation];W[bd];B[cl]C[23 could have gone at B 14 to save that group and make it stronger later, but I think C 8 was a big move too, which would you suggest?

RJ:  C8 is certainly bigger than saving the 2 stones, and your opponent can do better than capturing them next move at this stage in the game.  Whether the sequence for the top left was the correct one in light of the outcome is another matter.

Over the last few moves, I have added some variations with comments with regard to this.]
;W[bf]LB[jc:a]C[RJ:  For W, somewhere around a(k17) is much better.]
;B[bg]LB[of:a][kd:b]C[RJ: As you can see by what happens next, w does not need to answer this move.  There are many big moves on the board still.  Perhaps consider a or b instead.]
;W[cq]C[I don't know how to counter a move at this point. Any ideas? I tried to contain it and build a stong wall there, which I think worked.

RJ: This seems a little early for w, given the openness of the top of the board.  The correct side to play is the side that you chose - here you have good potential for territory - allow white to force you to strengthen it, whilst living small.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[bp]
(;B[eo]C[RJ: Better to defend at B5 and worry about cutting points later. See variation.]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[fg];B[ef]C[RJ: Small, and creates an empty triangle.  Still consider invading the top before w gets too thick on either side, or extending the right side group to the middle.

W is trying to press your side territory down, whilst giving him potential for a large top territory.]
;W[ff];B[fe];W[ed];B[kc]C[RJ: Good - lots of options for you at this time.]
;W[mc];B[hc]LB[ke:a]C[RJ: I think probably better to extend directly to a(l15) - there is not much potential for territory for you on the upper side (although plenty of oportunity to reduce w's), so safer to try to connect your stones out.  Playing as you did here risks trying to make your stones live in small space.]
;W[ge];B[ie];W[fi];B[dj]SQ[bo][bp]C[Do you think F 10 would have been to greedy? Thats why I choose E 10, for fear of losing that area.

RJ: D10 is the safest defensive move.  Don't count this as territory yet, though, as you have the marked w group at B5 peeking in the side.  F10 would be trying to surround too much territory in one move, and would also put your top left group in potential danger.  E10 could be feasable.

W is still pressing your territory on the left, but this is OK - his stone at F11 isn't going to make him any territory, whilst your play at D10 will make you territory soon.  F11 does help w build up strength to attack your top side group though.]
;W[no];B[mp];W[mo];B[kp];W[ol];B[of];W[fk];B[ek]LB[fm:a][lo:b]
C[RJ: Now is a better time to think about extending your territory on the bottom - maybe a(f7) or more likely b(m5).]
;W[gl];B[fm]C[I think N 15 would have been better since the left group was stable and  N 15 would keep white out of the middle from teh top.

RJ: W, it seems, is trying to get centre territory.  In these situations, I tend to try and take the edge territory, whilst keeping some stones peeking into the middle for wrecking purposes.  Your move here is reasonable territorially for you, but doesn't threaten white at all.

For territory down here, G6 is OK.  N15 or M15 are also good for the upper and right sides.  This would also make w's centre territory extremely unlikely.]
;W[me]
(;B[oi]C[RJ: Your top side group is under more pressure - better to play there.]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[pf];B[pg];W[oe];B[rl];W[rm];B[pk]LB[gb:a][ke:b]
[lb:c]C[RJ: This group is now stable, but you still have a weak group on the board.  Sort that out before playing any other moves - this move is worth not very much.  Consider a (g18), b(L15) or c(M18) first.]

;B[ib];W[ga];B[gf]LB[jc:a][jg:b]C[RJ: There doesn't seem very much point in this move.  To keep your top group alive, a(k17) should do the job.  You can then think about moving into the centre with the "dog's head" (I think that's what it's called) at b(k13).]

;W[hi];B[fj]LB[ii:a]C[RJ: is not worth very much, and results in loss of sente.  Perhaps a(j11) instead.]

;W[eh];B[ej];W[ih];B[hg];W[jh];B[kg]C[RJ:  This is where it all starts to really go wrong, as I'm sure you are aware.  In situations where a group is totally surrounded, and there are plenty of cutting points, it is a good idea to check to see if it really is alive - it certainly looks very hard to kill, but clearly not impossible.]

;W[mh]LB[jc:a]C[RJ: Do not fear the cut at N13.  At worst it is worth 2 points.  It is clear following the H15, J14 exchange that eyespace is getting short.  Now is the time to do something about it.  a(k17) will do the job - unfortunate to have to live in gote, but unavoidable now.]
;B[lh];W[li];B[mj];W[lj];B[nj]C[RJ: Again, this sequece of moves loses you sente]
;W[mg];B[nh];W[ic]TR[gd][hd][hc]C[RJ:  From here, I think that a sacrafice of the marked stones is the only way that the rest of the group can live.  See variation on next move.]

[ph][pj][qi]C[Final Result: Black 51, White 179 (Japanese)

RJ: Although the loss of the large black group was the final nail in the coffin here, even if it had lived, I estimate that the score would have been around
Black 60, White 110.

With a more solid end-game for the group on the right, you could have brought it back to perhaps Black 65, White 105.

I felt that you neglected the group at the top for too long, even though it stood the chance of living after the serious attacks began.  In the end, though, you lost this game because w's moves were consistently a bit bigger than yours, and was in control of the game for much of the time.

Your overall opening stragegy was good, but it is not a good sign if your opponent takes all 4 corners.

Hope this review has been of some use to you.

Best Wishes

(;W[lc];B[ka]C[RJ: If w tries to make the eye false from the right, taking L19 means that you can actually get 2 eyes on the edge if w plays K17, by playing J19 - if w plays j19, you play k17.]
