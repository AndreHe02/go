;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[cd];B[nc];W[kc]C[Not sure if wrong side.maybe r14 better.

reid: black R14 would focus more on building a black moyo, but it also encourages the white stones to work together.  I think either way is playable.]

C[This felt slow from white wasn't sure how to punish maybe q14 would be enough?

reid: Q14 seems a bit too early.  It will help white build his moyo.  If black already had a stone on the bottom (like L4), then Q14 could lead to a reasonable moyo battle, but without that, I think Q14 helps white more than black.]

(;B[cj]LB[ch:C][ci:B][ck:A][cn:D]C[reid:  I think this might be just one line too close.  If at A, then white's extension to B is still too close for white, but black could still extend to C if white were to invade (around D).]
;W[fq];B[dn]C[Felt over concentrated here but the pincer seemed absurd with the relation of c10]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[pp]C[Wasn't sure how to handle this the result seemed okay tho.]

(;B[qq];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[rm]LB[ql:A][iq:B]C[reid: Assuming the black stone at M3 lives, all these exchanges are better for black than for white.  But keeping M3 alive is crucial.

Normally, white doesn't want to see black hane at the head of three stones with A (R8), but in this case the right side is small, so he might want to take the crucial attack point at B (J3) immediately (take the urgent point, not the big point).  Which means black should probably play at B instead of S7 (white's hane at S7 isn't horrible for black, may not even be playable!)]
;W[ql]C[reid: However, white responds, so black has another chance to play J3.]
;B[pf]LB[fp:C][eq:B][iq:A]C[reid: I think this is the major turning point in the game.  Since black doesn't get a base for M3 by playing A (J3), white gets to attack first and take control of the flow of the game.

If black played A now, he would have no weak groups.  If he is feeling adventurous, he could try to exchange B for C first, but white might tenuki.

White would have to look out for F3 while trying to get eyes for his floating Q4 stones.  It will be difficult for him to hold on to his top-side moyo while defending these weaknesses.  Black will have a free hand in the future fighting, as well as an advantageous territory balance.]
;W[of];B[og];W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[ph]LB[iq:A]C[This hurt.

reid: Yes.  It might even be worth just ignoring the bad aji here and playing A (J3) now.  But it would be better to not make the Q14-N14 exchanges in the first place.]
;W[jq]C[reid: personally, I would play at J3 instead of K3.  If the F3 group is stable, then it's the single M3 stone versus the O3 group, with the obvious advantage going to white.

K3 leaves some aji for black to exploit.];B[fc]LB[kp:A][lp:B]
C[reid: This move feels desperate.  Black seems to be trying to throw the game into as much confusion as possible, but both M3 and F17 are facing significant numerical disadvantages.  This will not go well for black.

I think if black is to have any chance in this game, he must continue the fight at the bottom.  The only moves that keep O3 separated from K3 are A (L4) and B (M4).  Here, A looks like the only choice.]

(;B[dd];W[fg];B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[bb];B[gf];W[ke]LB[hg:A]C[After here should have tenuki k5 tempting any other recommendations?

reid: the F17 group has only one eye so far, and is still behind enemy lines.  My recommendation is: don't tenuki!  If you tenuki, best case: white surrounds you and forces you to make two eyes while he gets free moves in the center.

On the other hand, F14 is purely defensive.  A (H13) is more active (run before living), or you could try the push and cut with B/C/D now.  It doesn't work directly, but cuts have a way of changing the balance of power in interesting ways.  The cut, along with the gote F14 option is probably enough to stabilize this group.]
;B[ff];W[ef]
(;B[ee];W[kp]C[reid:  We can take a count here.

White's N16 area is worth about 20.  Black's lower left is also worth about 20 (unless he gets to defend the corner first).

White's upper left corner is about 12, as is black's upper right.

So we're left with black's lower right vs white's structure with F3 to Q4/R8.  Plus komi.  White has the lead.

White has no weak groups so black doesn't have any leverage to change the balance of territory.

I think there are two key lessons for black from this game.  First, this proverb: play the urgent point, not the big point.  Urgent points affect the balance of power.  Life and death are often at stake.

Second: don't play moves just because they are sente - think about whether the exchange favors him or you.  Be careful about giving up liberties - you might need them later!

Good luck, play strong.

(;B[pj]LB[og:A][qg:B][oq:C]C[reid: Black Q10 would end up awkwardly placed after white A (P13) and black's natural response at B (R13).  If you want to play in this area, it would work better closer to R4.

The R14 (and expected exchange of A for B) makes the right side small, so simply taking the corner with C (P3) would be better.]
