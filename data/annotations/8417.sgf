AB[pd][dp]C[lazydays [9k\]: hello gg
luzverano [11k\]: hi gg
Dear reviewer: Thanks so much in advance for reviewing this game! (:
This is how  I play these days, and going through the game myself, i cannot spot too many questionable moves excepte a few mistakes. There clearly are a lot of things/ missed tesuji that i have been missing. Do you have some advice on how to properly develop this game/what I could have done differently?
Thanks again in advance!];W[dd]C[hi, I'm siegoman, It is my pleasure to review this game for black.

These caught my eye as areas to focus on
S - give up a small move more something more substancial
D - defend stronger to prevent issues in the future
F - forcing move help you defend
W - weaken groups by chasing and preparing

Here are listed moves to consider by category and placement.  In CGoban if you Shift + Click on the location it will jump to that move, white's move before has the choices and bennefits.

S - 10:O3 - sacrifice stones to get a stronger influence
W - 20:R8 - lean into the strongish corner to attack the center.
S - 22:K4 - use thickness not to gain territory but to attack.
S - 44:S8 - defending two stones seems like a natural move, however what else does it gain you?
S - 60:S13 - threatening to save two stones forces the opponent to get stronger.
F - 92:O4 - threaten to capture and seal in the opponent.
D - 128:M9 - defend without a cutting point
F - 142:E8 - chase his stones to strengthen your own
W - 152:G10 - chase white away from his defenses];B[pq];W[pp]

C[white threatens to cap off Q9 and seal in R12, connecting Q8 with Q5 and P12.
white is on the verge of covering the entire right side with one continuous dragon.

R8 = threaten to go under to R6 and cut off the corner from the center.
- this is a forcing move, maybe black was hoping for white R7, giving black curring chances

Q6 = threaten to separate Q5 from Q8
- black has a good follow up move with R6, which threatens capture via R4
- black can lean against the strong stones in the corner and attack the white P9]
(;B[ql];W[pm]C[
black has some strong stones around P5 and wants to get some territory down below

K4 = the star point seems good, cash in

G3 = keep a larger space near your strong stones
- maybe do a forcing move first to get it stronger via P6
- play a bit lower is my style
- strengthen the corner]

;B[sm]C[
this move and the next black move seem small, big space up top.]
;W[sn]C[
White makes a move on the very edge of the board, black has an opportunity to take the initiative by ignoring this small move.

S8 = respond directly, defend
- save the two black stones, 
- secure life for R9 group
- R3 group is alive, white capturing S7 does not change living status of R3
- R3 group is connected with Q7, capturing S7 does not connect groups

P10 = indirectly respond, escape
- take the initiative
- divide P12 stones which have no base from living group of Q8]

;B[ol];W[nj];B[sj];W[rh];B[rk];W[pg]C[
White decides to capture two black stones, but this costs White because now black can take the initiative.  Where on the board is big for black to jump into?

S13 = try and save the stones
- threaten to save R12 and capture S12
- force white to respond, if white ignores then black gets a stone
- P11 is alive, plent of eye space, if black captures S12 white doesn't care
- R9 is alive, if black captures S12 it may connect with R15, which sits under P12 and has little influence on the game.

K17 = extend from Q16 corner


K10 = connect D10 and K4 areas
- you mentioned how you like the moyo play, ignore distracting moves like Q13 that don't matter
- threaten to jump into the top of the board and get even more]

;B[sg];W[qh];B[oe];W[qd];B[pf];W[sk];B[sl]C[i am about to lose the black stones in the upper right corner (actuallym i save them but have to sacrifice the two stoners below in the lower right corner). I cannot see any way I could have saved them otherwise. Can you?

ko fights are all about finding something where a response is needed.
B2 area seems like black can play and force white to reply.]

(;B[pe];W[qb];B[oc];W[ob];B[nf];W[oq]C[
Once again white cashes in and captures a couple stones.  Black needs to take the initiative

O4 - defend the cut at O4 by moving there first.

O2 - threaten to capture P2 and keep white out of M2 area
- the stones at Q3 are lost, but M2 area isn't quite ours.]

white tries to enter black's area in K4

M9 - defend with some threat of going up into K10

M8 - defend more securley, 
- preventing the cutting point of M8, 
- making N8 stronger
- indirectly threaten to jump up into K10]

(;B[fo];W[mq];B[lq]C[Here, i thought I had a good moyou, but white managed to creep in through two sides!]
;W[mp];B[no];W[mm];B[mo];W[ll];B[lp];W[em]C[
white extends from his two stones, normally this is a strong connection.
black has some weakness around F5 and F3.

E8 = cap off growth towards the open area at E10

E6 = threaten to capture the two white stones
- with C6 and C7 this attack becomes stronger
- black can connect his F3 stones in sente]
(;B[el];W[fn];B[go];W[gn];B[hn];W[ho];B[hm];W[fl];B[ek];W[gl]
C[
white forms bamboo with G6, growing towards the center.

G10 = black can block white from G11.
- this gets more space around H12
- this has the negative side effect of forcing white to connect with M8

J9 = push white away from M8,]
