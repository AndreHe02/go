C[hi please review this game for black. i just started a few days ago and wanted to know how good or bad my go is
--------
It seems to me from this game that you've learned a lot those first few days, but a few weaknesses you have are holding you back.  Hopefully this review helps you overcome them.]

[qn]C[This move right here is what we call "too slow".  You aren't expanding very much by doing this, and early in the game it's important to look for big moves.  Try something on the right side instead]
;W[ek];B[el];W[dl];B[dk]C[Good move here, white needs to be more cautious, and you took advantage of that.]

(;B[dm];W[bi];B[cl]C[This move was also unneeded.  Take your time, and don't be afraid of white, it looks lik eyou paniced here.  If you really wanted a more secure shape here, see the variation I posted a few moves back.]
;W[gh];B[jk]TR[hl]C[This move is too separated from your other stones.  If white wants to invade the bottom, he can enter from H8, or somewhere lower down.  You can't secure the bottom like this, and even if you did white would win because the top is larger.  Try play along the right side some.]
;W[jj];B[mj];W[pg];B[ph]C[Once again, this stone is too far from your other stones, which means white can push you around.  Here don't be afraid to group your stones close together, because it will give you strength to launch an attack later.]

;W[gr];B[gq]TR[ir]C[J2 would be better.  This move here abandons your H2 stone to white's attack.]
;W[ir];B[qg];W[pf];B[qf];W[qe];B[hk]TR[hl]C[This is too risky, white might get lucky and move into your territory below.  It's better to stay safe with a move like H8]
;W[gj];B[gb]TR[ec]SQ[lh]C[When you jump into your opponent's territory, almost never start on the 2nd line from the edge.  You don't have any room to build eyes.  If anything, try E17, though surviving here in the heart of white's territory may be impossible.

Instead of invading by jumping right in, it's be better to eat away at white's territory by attacking along the border.]

When deciding if the trade is worthwhile, try roughly counting out the territory you lose and gain.  You'll eventually be able to predict well enough that you can see even a few points difference.]

------------
It seems to me that you have a great set of skills so far, but you made one key mistake: you tried to take over the entire bottom half of the board.  This might be fine on a 9x9 board, or maybe even a 13x13 board, but it's a bad strategy on a 19x19 board.  White was able to jump right into your territory on the bottom, and you ended up losing big.

I recommend watching more games, particularly the opening parts.  See how more experienced players will play all over the board.  

I liked watching your game because you used a lot of creative moves.  Don't be afraid to try new things, a lot of times you came out on top.  Just keep playing and watching more games, and soon experience with smooth your rough edges.
