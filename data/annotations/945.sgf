(;B[qm]TR[np]C[this is not good. Once white plays the marked stone, black must move in such a way that white does not also get the corner as well...]

(;W[cj];B[oc];W[mc];B[oe];W[pf];B[qb]C[somehat defensive. other possiblilities for this move are Q12 and M17.]

(;W[pj]C[this makes it much easier for black to get at least one eye on the side.]
;B[qk];W[qj]
(;B[rc]C[this is the kind of move one makes when either

a) it is necessary for one's life, or

b) when it threatens the base of the other player's group.

In thiscas,. neither of these are true.];W[jd]C[good timing for this move.]
;B[gc];W[bd];B[cc];W[cf];B[bc]C[again, this is not necessary for black's safety, nor is it sufficiently threatening to white to warrant it at this time. Much better to play the big extension at K4.]
;W[cn];B[fq]C[better to play K3 or K4.];W[bp];B[cq];W[jq]TR[dp]
C[notice how black did not manage to extend in either direction from the star point stone. It is not good to let this happen.]
;B[hq];W[jo]C[You can perhaps feel that black is falling behind. White's extensions are larger, and he has more central influence as well.]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[qe]
(;W[qf]C[back to the game.];B[re]TR[qf]C[it should be clear that the marked exchange favors black.]
;W[nd];B[od];W[mf];B[nf]
(;W[mg];B[ng]
(;W[rp]TR[mg][ng]C[This move illustrates a common positional error--the tendency to leave a critical situation before it is played out. The pushing fight on the 13th line is the focus of the game right now, and both players must keep their attention there.]

(;B[ro];W[nj]C[The right idea although O11 or O12 would be better.]
;B[qp]C[a good force.];W[rq]C[This would be a good time to make a preliminary count.

Black: 10 LL, 5 LR, 15 UL, 15 UR = 45
White: 20 left, 20 LR, 10 top = 50

So white seems ahead by a bit with better prospects for expanding the lead.]

(;B[ho]C[This move is much too passive. It poses no threat.]
;W[fn]C[and gives white a chance to expand.];B[ef]C[Same problem here.]
;W[dg]C[White is happy to have the chance to fortify his position.]
;B[he];W[ib]C[better to play at F12 or H7.];B[hb]C[Black must try to avoid the temptation to respond to white moves such as these, or he will forever be in gote.]
;W[br]C[big, but better saved for the endgame...];B[bq];W[aq]
;B[cr];W[bo]C[because sente is too valuable.];B[be]C[Also big, but gote.]
;W[bf];B[cd];W[ce];B[nn];W[ae]C[much too small. Again, far better to play at H7, F12, or J13.]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[sp];W[pp];B[qo];W[rr];B[lo];W[mo];B[hm]C[good locally, but just throwing away the stone at M5 is a huge loss.]
;W[ln];B[fh]C[good, but already too little too late.];W[ei]
C[the latest count:

Black: 20 UL, 15 UR, 10 LL, 5 LR = 50

(;B[fo]C[This is clearly less effective.];W[gk]C[big.];B[do]
TR[fo]C[Making this move now just highlights that the marked stone was an error. Now it stands out as a complte waste of a move.]
;W[cl]C[White is wise to correct his defect.];B[rf];W[rj]C[This is also wise by white, improving his shape through an attack on black.]
;B[rk];W[pl];B[ql];W[pm];B[pn];W[ac];B[ab];W[bb]C[no reason for white to start this ko.]
;B[ad];W[sk];B[sl];W[ac];B[cb];W[aa];B[rm]C[better for black to capture at T10.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[ed];B[ec];W[eg];B[fg];W[ir];B[hr];W[hs]C[bad because it is gote.]
;B[gs];W[is];B[jb]C[very good.];W[ic];B[ia];W[kb];B[ja];W[nm]
;B[iq];W[kr];B[ph];W[qh];B[rg]C[pulling back at P12 is better.]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[mi];W[jl]C[black's last chance to create confusion is to attack the upper white group ...]

(;B[jn]C[bad becuse it will lose sente.];W[kn];B[jp];W[kp];B[ip]

;B[bs];W[ar];B[kg];W[kf];B[lg];W[lf];B[ie];W[jg];B[lh]C[let's count again:

Black: 21 LL, 6 LR, 17 UL, 16 UR = 60

White: 31 left, 8 top, 18 lower = 57

So if white can get just 3 points in the center he is even. He should get more like 10.

His next move should be at L10.];W[hg];B[lk]C[excellent play.]
;W[ll];B[jn];W[ih];B[im]C[black has gained a bit.]
(;W[lj]C[big error.];B[kk];W[kj];B[jk];W[jj];B[km]C[a terrible loss for white.]
;W[lm];B[kl]C[new count:

Black: 29 LL, 6 LR, 16 UL, 16 UR = 67

White: 31 left, 10 top, 19 lower, 4 center = 64

Soo black has pulled slightly ahead due to his captures in the lower center, and the elimination of white's central territory.

With no plays left worth more than a point ,black has secured a small margin of victory.]
;W[sq]C[White played better for much of the game but got very careless toward the close. Black took good advantage of white's lapses to steal a win.
