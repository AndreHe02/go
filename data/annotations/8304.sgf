C[Hi, and thank you very much for reviewing my game. I understand you're probably busy, but I always appreciate stronger players taking a look at my game.

I play Black this game. I was behind fairly early in the game, and despite taking some opportunities to catch up throughout the game, I was still behind in points in the end. I'm open to all comments you could give me, but I'd greatly appreciate advice for stuff during my early and mid-game.



HY: Hi, I'm your reviewer, Hamato (HamatoYosh on KGS).  I will prefix my comments with HY.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[dq];B[do];W[dl];B[gp]LB[eo:A][dp:B]C[I saw this move in particular during a recent dan game I was spectating, so I just decided to try it. I don't know the joseki for this situation.

HY: I started playing this move a lot when I was around your rank.  It is probably the most common response to the two space high pincer.  There is a very common joseki and a few variations.  The most common joseki (starting at A) is worth learning, because it occurs so often.  If you learn it, it won't take long before you get to play it.  There are also a few tricks and alternate joseki you need to be aware of which I will show also, but getting the main one down is the important thing.

White has some other responses (B being the most common), but I have detailed the variations at A quite extensivley, and I don't want to overwhelm you with this particular joseki right now.  A is most likely what you will see when you play it.]
;W[eo]LB[en:B][dp:A]C[HY: The correct response is at B (see variation).]

;B[dm];W[cn];B[bn];W[em];B[co];W[fn]LB[pj:A][pm:B][op:C][nq:E]
[oq:D]C[HY: The tenuki here seems reasonable to me.  A looks good.  I would also consider B as a play (this type of play is seen commonly with a chinese type of formation), or simply approaching the white corner around C, D, or E (white's support on the left is far away).]
(;B[pj]C[I tenuki here because I didn't want White to take it. If possible, I wanted to just limit him to the bottom side and make him struggle to establish himself anywhere else. Given the thickness of his E4 area and the existence of R4, I thought not playing Q10 would've been a bad idea.]
;W[kq];B[ic];W[nc]LB[lc:A][oc:B]TR[ic]C[HY: Since you played chinese, you should kick at B.]

;B[ne];W[me]LB[oc:B][op:A]C[HY: You can cut at B.  It is a big play.]
(;B[op];W[oq]LB[pp:B][nq:A]C[HY: A is ok, and probably how I would play (but see the variation after white q3!).  However, the avalanche at B is also an option.]
(;B[nq];W[pq]LB[nm:B][mp:A]C[HY: I would consider playing more lightly, like at B.  There's no reason to give w something to attack here.]
(;B[mp]LB[ko:A][no:B]C[HY: White should attack on B.]
(;W[ko];B[qn]LB[no:B][po:A]C[HY: This is likely overplay. White should attack on B.]

HY: Yes, you are right.  White was also allowed to solidify his bottom left.  The problem was making the O3 group a target in the first place.  Don't give your opponent something to attack in his area of influence, especially when there are still big plays on the board.]

The genius of the play at A is that it protects the cut at D6 while also taking the corner (if black protected the cut with C6, then white could push into the corner later at C2 [see variation at B\], but B4 allows black to play B2 in response to C2).]
(;B[bp]LB[dn:B][kp:A][cr:C]TR[dl]C[HY: This is the most common line of the joseki.  White usually finishes by playing somewhere around A. White ends with a position on the bottom, and black ends with the corner.   White often leaves the triangle stone alone for now.  It can be useful aji later but it's not urgent.

The white move at B shows why B4 protects the cut.  The white move at C shows why B4 protects the corner.  Since B4 does these two thigns at once, it is a very efficient move.]
