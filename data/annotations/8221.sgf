Important to learn from this game:

1. Walls are for attacking not for making territory - when you create a wall, your goal is to push the other player against that wall and not use it to create territory. It is simply an inefficient way to make territory, if nothing else.
2. When you are not secure enough, do not invite unnecessery fights when you are in a favorable position - it just let's the pther player to exploit your weaknesses in the fight.
3. Priorities when developing: corners, sides, center - unless urgent defense required! Big points before small, always.
4. Instead of local fighitng, have a goal and go for the greater target.
5. Know when to sacrifice or abandon stones - have a strategy and once stones have fulfilled their roles, do not be afraid to abandon them.
6. Near-board-end situations - ALWAYS try to read them as far as you can and take special care.
7. Protect cuts when possible - a cut is an invitation to use it, and when it is left oopen too much, another battle will catch up to it.
8. Empty triangle is considered bad shape for a reason - even when you are forced to play it, it is usually because of a previous mistake. Try to avoid them.

And a note for white:
Play bolder! Don't crawl but use jumps - one-space jumps are VERY hard to cut, and even if they do get cut, they still serve you.

Good luck to you in the future :)];B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[cd];B[dj]
C[I prefer to soldify my own homebase with P3 before invading, but it's more of a matter of style.]
;W[cn];B[jd]C[This move abandons the course set by D10 - if white plays C12 it gains black virtually nothing.]
;W[fc]
(;B[jp]C[The reasoning here is understandable (extend the framework on the bottom), but natural extensons of R4 are P3 and then R10 - using the upper side as well. See first variation.

Anyways, Protecting the virtual link of K16 and D10 is much urgent, since white could easily separate them with something like G13.]
(;W[hq]C[Excellent move, threatening to undercut black - unwise for black to ignore.]
;B[cl]C[Small and gains nothing since white can easily block to the bottom (as white did in the game), undermine from above with C12 or even play somehwere else :)

If using this idea, however, C13 would be better.]
(;W[en];B[cf]C[Usually you should be careful with extending by 3 lines, but the two other black stoned on the left allows you to be bolder.]
;W[ee];B[ef]C[Do not play near strength - if playing on this side, then E13 would be better.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[ge];B[gf]C[What does black gain with this crawling? He is already quite stable there, and continuing with this only going to force K16 into difficulty.

Moreover, building a wall when your strngth leans on it gains you nothing - you should trap the other player against you wall, not lean on it yourself. Especially since white can undermine all the effect of it with something as simple as H8.

D10's invasion, although could easily be stopped, nevertheless achieved its full potential for the time - move on to different parts of the board (protect bottom, solidify right, etc.)]
;W[hc]
(;B[hd]C[Very local fighting - black cannot gain here anything (white cannot be cut), but can lose much (separated, undermined, etc.)]
;W[gd]C[Nice and efficient block.];B[ic]C[Good move, but it brings no relief due to H16's invite for havoc.]
;W[he]C[Excellent! Separate the black, while attacking, and gain access to the center.]
(;B[id]C[H16 should have been abandoned! See variation.];W[hb]
;B[if];W[ie]
(;B[jf]C[Wrong direction - protect top-right, not the center. Rememeber - corners, sides, center!]
;W[je];B[ke]C[Let's read for black (see variations for playing it out).
White has only three options in this direction:
K18 - nice as endgame move, but it settles the fight, since black will block and both sides will soldify.
L14 - that would be suicidal for white, so white won't consider it
L16 - disconnects a large group (leaving it with only 2 liberties) leaves the top open for white's taking and leaves black with a useless wall.
Answer for white is easy.]
(;W[kd]C[And white does it.];B[kc];W[ld];B[lc];W[ib];B[jc];W[mc]
(;B[mb]C[Must fight here, not retreat! N16 is the necessary move, since white must protect it - otherwise white gained nothing at all here. See variation.]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[ka];B[la];W[jb];B[md]C[Too late...];W[le]
(;B[kf]C[MUST have been O17 for black! But it is clear that black overestimates this wall of his.]
;W[lb];B[nc]C[One move too late...];W[nb]C[Nice ko for white and black shouldn't be tempted. It's time to cut losees and prevent white from gaining more - even if black wins there, he gains virtually nothing. There are MUCH more profitable places on the board (bottom, right, moyo in center)]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[kb];W[na];B[ob];W[lb];B[mc];W[ma];B[oa];W[la]
C[Overall - white has gained amazingly much here (compare to move 23) and very importantly - left an opening into right center from M15. All this from black inviting this fight when was in a clearly favorable position and misjudging the crucial direction of protection here.]
;B[ho]C[Right notion, but too slow - leaves white the option to undercut from the bottom at K2, go into the center with G7 and just invading at Q10 or similar (can connect to M15 or solidify himself there. J3 or J2 would be much more profitable - secure your base then go look for adventure.]
;W[go]C[G4 could also work as a defense - attack should go from E6, anyway,]
;B[gn];W[fo];B[dm]C[Why forcing it? White easily defends, black gains nothing. Wasted move - much better H6, to defend the cut or again bottom or right (becoming urgent!)]
;W[dn];B[gl];W[fm];B[fn]C[Why attacking? Think about what can you gain - in no way can you take soem white here (very strong) and you gain nothing. Make moves that actually mean something.]
;W[gm];B[em]C[Once again - black doesn't seem to see that left is safe, but it is completely so and already served its purpose! Protect your moyo on the right/center!]
;W[hn]C[Obvious move and good that white didn't neglect it - now black has lost its center.]
;B[fl]C[Wrong direction again... Enclosing the right and fortifying it will bring much more point.

Besides - walls are for attacking, not making territory.];W[io]
C[Nice move, but should get for the greater goal - destroying black's center hopes.]
;B[jo];W[in];B[jn]C[Good start...];W[im];B[ik]C[... and here again the misjudgment.]
;W[jm]C[White happily crawls and attacks black while reducing black's potential territory.]
;B[ip]C[H5 cannot gain anyting so not worth saving. White will block easily at G4.]
;W[hp];B[ir];W[hr];B[iq];W[is];B[js];W[hs];B[kr]C[Finally protected, but it is not urgent nor the biggest point! One invasion by white on the right and black loses everything.]
;W[km];B[np];W[kn]C[White has nothing to look for here - N8, N7, N6 are the option to play, if no invasion on the right.]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[kp];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[mo];W[jq];B[mq]C[Good try for white (though it was doomed from the beginning - black is too strong here)]
;W[ln]C[Playing very slow for white - N7 or N8 is much better]
;B[mn];W[mm];B[nm]C[As white should have inaded the right, much better for black to play there himself - gain territory and prevent whites invasion. R10 is an excellent move like that - for both sides. Q10 could work as well, but better be safe since white is close now.]
;W[ml];B[nl];W[kl]C[White needs to pay bolder - and not just crawl, but at least he is attacking.]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[mj]C[Finally black seeing what is needed... But should not forget the M15 white opening!]
;W[lj];B[li];W[ki];B[lh];W[kh];B[kg]C[This is like building a strong front gate, while leaving the back exit wide open. It is clear that white will crawl from M15.

Also important to mention that white will clearly bite on the left and black practically forces it (not that white minds, I guess)]
;W[ji]C[Bad shape and too slow.

If white wants to protect the cut at L10, better play K10.
If white wants to attack left, better play at J11.];B[ii]C[And black wisely puts a stopper on white's initiative here (even though the wiser course would be not to force white to do it).]
;W[jh]C[What was white thinking?.. Leave out the inefficiency, what does it gain?.. Better move would be J12 - keep attacking.]
;B[ih]C[And black uses white's mistake here to keep him blocked.]
;W[ig];B[hg];W[jg];B[jj];W[kj];B[jk]C[That is a clear mistake! What does it gain? Better keep white from cutting at H14 by playing there yourself.]
;W[hf]C[And white jumps in to exploit blacks mistake...]
(;B[gg]C[Unneded, because even if white cuts, he can gain nothing here. See variations.]
;W[lg]
(;B[mf]C[It doesn't protect anything - the black group is dead. It just forces white to take it.]
;W[lf];B[me]C[Wrong direction - this point is easily defendable at O15, unlike the other opening - as white clearly demonstrates in the game.]
;W[mg];B[nh]C[Too far - should have been one point above (O13). It is abandoning of M12 stones, but they are almost doomed as they are.]
;W[mh];B[mi]C[Why save two stones and leave a glaring hole at O13?..]
;W[ng];B[oh];W[og];B[pg];W[nf];B[ne];W[oe];B[oc];W[od];B[pf]
;W[of];B[nd]C[Gains nothing - white is grateful.];W[pe]C[And shows his gratitude here.]
;B[qd];W[qe];B[qf]C[Must remember that near-board-end groups are not as safe as in the center. Q17 is much more important, since unless you read completely, the situation there is never sure.]
;W[pc]C[It's dead - no matter what side black decides to protect.]
(;B[pb];W[qc]
(;B[rd]C[Black dies even if plays from the other side];W[qb]
;B[re];W[ph]C[This is simply exploiting the cuts black has left - do not leave many of them in a row. Be sure to protect them.]
;B[qh];W[pi];B[oi];W[oj]C[That's exactly is why black's empty triangle here was wrong.]
;B[pj];W[nk];B[ok];W[ni];B[nj]C[Misread. Should have been at R11.]
;W[nk];B[pl]C[And now black has to defend this double cut instead of protect against another push by white.]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[rh];B[rg];W[qg];B[qj]C[Doesn't threaten anything - if you want a proper ko fight, make some serious threat. Like B5 or D16 (very big). And if you are abandoning the ko fight, make sure you make profit as you retreat.]
;W[rf];B[sh];W[sg];B[si];W[rc]C[Another empty triangle... Should have been at S10.]
;B[rj];W[sd]C[Unnecessary - playing in your own territory.]
;B[de]C[Finally black attacks, but it is too late.];W[dd];B[ce]
C[Again - empty triangle which achieves nothing. B15 should have been the move here - at least put white on the defensive.]
(;W[bd]C[Should have been one point down - take points from black.]
;B[be];W[ad]C[Again - the same.];B[bn]C[Good! (again - too late at this stage, but still).

At this point, it's the place for black to resign , but if black wants to continue - he must be daring and plunge deep into white's territory and look if white makes mistakes (for example - to C3). White must not panic and just calmly defend.]
;W[bo];B[bm];W[ao];B[an];W[hl];B[hk];W[il];B[hi]C[What does it do?.. (again - empty triangle)]
;W[gk]C[No chance, unless counting on black to make a mistake, which is not nice play :) True - he did, but still not the way you should plan your moves.]
;B[fk];W[gj];B[hj];W[fj];B[ek];W[ej];B[di]C[This was the unnecessery move that should have been used to close some real hole in defenses - like E8 or C7.]
;W[cm];B[bl];W[dk];B[dl];W[el]C[Nice play by white!];B[ck];W[ek]
;B[fi]C[Again - asking for troube. When minimizing losses - play safe. E11 should have been the move.]
;W[ei];B[eh];W[gi];B[fh];W[gh];B[hh];W[ae];B[af];W[cj]C[Nice cut by white.]
(;B[bj]C[Should have defended from the other side - here white has a direct forcing move (C11). See variation.]
;W[ci];B[dh];W[bi];B[aj];W[ak]C[Good by white - black is dead now.]
;B[ai];W[ah];B[bk];W[al];B[am];W[ak];B[bh];W[al];B[ch]
(;W[ai]C[Should have been at B13 (see variation).];B[ag];W[ck]
C[Unnecessary, since there is nothing for black to gain by playing here. This costs white a point - playing in your own territory.]
;B[fg]C[Unnecessary - playing in your own territory.];W[tt]
