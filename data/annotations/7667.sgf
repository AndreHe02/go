AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I was Black in this game and resigned much later than I should.  This is one of those "How can I lose so badly with such a handicap?" games.  My estimation is that the first 100 moves were the critical part of this game.  If you agree then concentrating comments there is probably a good idea.  If my evaluation is way off then please feel free to explain your evaluation to me and comment whatever you see as appropriate.  Thank you.


Whats seems typical is that you often miss the big picture - you try to solve some situation locally (either attack or defence) but end up in some bigger trouble, having to give up on the previous plan and loose some stones.]

[md:B][qj:C]C[Letting white connect here is painful - you lost the base of stones that should have been strong, giving white something to attack. Making a weak group is the main objective when playing handi as white.

For the next move, I would suggest to either settle your group by B or attack right away on C or one below C.]
;B[mb]TR[pd][of]C[Your main concern now should be to settle the triangle group. You cannot kill the white corner, but even if you could, you now help him with the attack on triangles.]

Not really. White is maybe a bit better on the right side, but the left side is still yours, so you have lost max two of the handicaps.]

It cannot look good when you let white connect in the next move. You cannot attack like this when you intend to let him connect.]
