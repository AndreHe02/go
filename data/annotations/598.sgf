[ne:B][mc:C]C[reid: Hmmm, the usual responses for black here
are a (r17), b (o15) or c (n17).  I'm not sure what
should happen next with this move :-)];W[qc];B[ne];W[le]LB[lb:A]
[kd:B]C[reid:  When white plays m15, black can still connect
underneath with a (m18).  Perhaps white would rather
play at b (l16 to prevent that.];B[je];W[lg];B[lb];W[md];B[mc]
;W[nd];B[kc]C[reid: this atari doesn't seem very urgent yet.  White
can ignore it without suffering too much damage.  I
think there are bigger moves to play at this time.];W[oe]LB[od:A]
[ob:B]C[reid: if white really feels the need to connect here,
it might be better to simply play at a (p16).  Later he
cut across the knight's move with b (p18).];B[ld]LB[me:A][od:B]
[lf:C]C[reid: now black has the sequence black a (n15), white b (p16),
black c (m14), so it's difficult for white to make anything from
this wall.  this makes the game difficult for white already,]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[fq]C[reid: this looks like an ideal joseki for white (considering
the whole board).  perhaps black should try something
different from e3?];B[dq];W[fp];B[cm]C[reid: eh?   black may regret this thinness later.]
;W[jp];B[qn];W[ql];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[pr];W[or];B[qr]
;W[pn];B[qm];W[pm];B[rl];W[rk];B[qk];W[pl];B[rj]LB[rm:A][me:B]
C[reid: this is asking for too much, I think.  Better for black to
connect at a (s7) in sente, leaving the threat of the sequence
starting with b (n15) for later reduction.  white's two walls
would be too close for efficiency.];W[qo];B[sk];W[ro]C[reid: ouch! this hurts.]
;B[rp]C[reid: the corner is still dead if white moves first.  it
is unreasonable to expect to live on both sides.];W[qi];B[pj]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[df]LB[bf:A]C[reid: this seems a bit unreasonable for white.  simply hane at
a (b14) is good enough.];B[dg];W[ef];B[cg];W[db];B[ec]LB[eb:A]
C[reid: bad shape!  the hane at a (e18 ) looks OK for black.]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc];B[hb];W[hd];B[ge]
;W[fd]C[reid: argh! disaster for black. the problem with bad shape
is that it always comes back to haunt you :-)];B[ff];W[eg];B[eh]
;W[ee];B[ic];W[em];B[fg]C[reid: gote.];W[fh]LB[ps:A]C[reid: this cut doesn't seem to serve much purpose.
I think killing the corner with a (q1) is more to the point.]

;B[fl];W[bm];B[bn];W[en];B[bl];W[am];B[al];W[cn];B[an];W[bm]
;B[am];W[dn];B[bm];W[el]C[reid: white successfully reduces black's small territory, but
he has allowed black into his own large moyo.];B[co];W[ci];B[cj]

;W[gm];B[il];W[hn];B[im];W[gk]C[reid: white is easily satisfied :-)  white should be thinking
about killing the whole group, not just two stones.];B[in];W[ho]
;B[nr];W[nq];B[mr];W[os];B[op];W[oq];B[lp];W[kr];B[kq];W[jq]
;B[kn];W[lq]LB[lo:A]C[reid: again, white should be thinking about killing large
pieces, not small ones.  I'd try a (m5) instead.  try to put
preassure on both groups at the same time, and even aim
at the r9 group.];B[kp];W[mq];B[jo];W[io];B[ip];W[hp]LB[iq:A]
C[reid: oops! this needs to be at a (j3).];B[jr];W[iq];B[lr]
;W[rm];B[sr];W[rs];B[rr];W[nj];B[qj];W[pi];B[sm];W[sn];B[ri]
;W[mo]LB[rh:A]C[reid: I don't understand this move.  why doesn't white
continue attacking with a (s12)?  even if the black group
manages to live, white gains by attacking.];B[qh];W[ph];B[qg]
;W[pg];B[rf];W[re];B[rg];W[qe];B[ir];W[hr];B[me];W[mf];B[od]

;W[ks];B[ls];W[km];B[ln];W[kl];B[jm]LB[lj:A]C[reid: eh? why not take at a (m18)?]
;W[ll]C[reid: why not take the ko?  if white is afraid of losing
three stones, he can always connect here after black
uses up one ko threat.];B[lj];W[er];B[dr];W[fr];B[qa];W[ra]
;B[pa];W[rc];B[ok];W[nl];B[ol];W[om];B[nk];W[mj];B[nh];W[oh]
LB[oj:A]C[reid: white a (p10) looks a little better.];B[oj]
;W[oi];B[ng];W[og];B[gn];W[fm];B[fc];W[ds];B[cs];W[es];B[cr]
;W[ns];B[js];W[ps];B[qs];W[sl];B[rk];W[dp]LB[sf:A][lh:B][ga:C]
[ec:D][ah:E]C[reid: after switching back and forth several times,
the game has finally gotten pretty close.   Since there
is no komi, white seems to be a little bit behind.

This move is not worth any points, and white cannot
afford to be giving away anything.  he should be trying
to get every possible endgame point.  a (t14) and b (m12)
are both sente, then  c (g19), d (e17) and e (a12) look like the
biggest gote moves to consider.];B[mp];W[np];B[sm]C[reid: this is only 1/3 point for black at this time.]
;W[ec];B[gc];W[lh];B[li];W[ke];B[rn];W[rm];B[kd];W[kg];B[hf]
C[reid: 1 point, but gote twice to get it.];W[pc];B[oc];W[do]
;B[if];W[mg];B[gg];W[hg];B[ah];W[fe];B[ag];W[be];B[gf];W[af]
;B[ai];W[ga];B[ha];W[fa];B[se]LB[sf:A]C[reid: a (t14) should have been white's sente.]
;W[sd];B[sf];W[sp];B[sq];W[so]LB[hs:A]C[reid: a (h1) is bigger.]
;B[sl]C[reid: h1 is still bigger.];W[hs];B[hk];W[gl];B[tt];W[is]

[la][lc][ma][mb][md][na][nb][nd][oa][rh][rq][rs][sg][sh][si]
[sj][ss]C[reid:  The game finishes very close: 1/2 point win for white.

I think both players are ready to try to focus on a more strategic
style of play; to try to take their game to the "next level".  Put some
thought into making your stones work together cooperatively instead
of just taking tactical (local) gains.  If go is like war, then the stones are
the soldiers.  Wars are not won by individual soldiers, they are won by
successful coordination between different platoons and divisions.

But ultimately, even if your strategy is good, it is easy to lose a dozen
points in the endgame unless you know the value of each endgame
play.  There were enough mistakes by both sides in this endgame to
let the game go either way.  Counting up the values of endgame moves
may seem boring, but it's the only way to ensure that your hard work of
strategic thinking will result in a win.])
