C[Remi (reviewer)

Hi ! 

I'm an official 1D in France (which means I should be around 2d on KGS)

I'm only 3 stones stronger than you, so I didn't get into much detail when I was unsure. However, I spotted 2 or 3 spots where you definitely made mistakes. Please have a look at the variations I gave you. I hope they will help you get a better understanding of the game. 

Enjoy !];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[jp]
(;W[qn]C[q6 was better?

Remi : probably OK. It doesn't matter that much. 

Going into the corner was also playable (the result looks better too)

On a side note, I would not play that move because of black R3, which effectively cuts w's stones and starts a fight.]

LB[qe:A]C[semms too soon

Remi : I agree. A (R14) would result in a very severe attack. Also, I think that black was a little passive and missed multiple occasions to attack you]
(;B[qh]LB[nc:B][qc:C][nd:D][of:A]C[Remi : I don't like b's move

Now, I would intuitively change direction instead of move A. A is played when you can get a sort of attack on move R12, which is clearly not possible here. 

In the game, you lived comfortably mainly because black was too submissive.

Move C is peaceful. Black gets a pretty large moyo, but it can be reduced, and the game is still playable. 
Move B / D may lead to dangerous fights.]

At this point b has
- 15 points on top 
- 23 points on left

w 10 points, and his potential is reduced by the 2 marked stones.

[ci:C]C[

in this situation i was uncertain about what to do, there is a best move of this?

Remi : well, that's pretty simple. You have a lot of power, so you should use it : create a fight and see what happens. Here, just cutting the opponent looks ok (see variations)

Trying to use your power to create a moyo in the center is a mistake : there aren't enough points there. 

Here I explore 3 variations. A is your move, and feels a bit strange. 

B and C look more common. Cutting at C seems to give the best result.]

around 40 points for black (I counted 0 for the bottom since it's open on both sides]

Since I'm not particularly strong at yose, I wont comment from here.
