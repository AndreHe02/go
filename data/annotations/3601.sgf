>> The ">>" will indicate comments added by dbHaze after the game.

>> Reasons I'd like this reviewed: I felt really pressured early on.  Both sides made mistakes.  I felt that, in many areas, both sides could have made much 'bigger' moves.  The comment was made that, had certain obvious mistakes not been made, it would have been a much closer game.]

C[### trying to save these three stones is a bad idea for a few reasons

-they are only worth 3 points
-they do no serve a purpsose
-black will make a large profit as you run.

So you leave them there, for later, when they maybe useful

CesarMeh [?\]: hey can we undo that?

>>I think bB13 would have done much better than bB12, but I also thought that bB12 would be pretty good anyway, and so I didn't give the undo.

(;B[di];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[bi];W[be]C[### Very important part of go, if you can see flaw in your own move, find a different move.  Never hope for a mistake, you will play atleast two stones stronger by making this change. 

In a high handi game, this is not so, as you will have to "rattle blacks cage" with moves you do not think he can find an answer to.  But in even games, I would suggest to never do it.  It rarely works, and you normally just make your oppent stronger, or atleast loose sente.   


>>Me being hopeful... after all, I thought I was playing my friend's brother, who tends to make alot of mistakes... turns out later, that I was also playing against both him and his brother.]

Yose means moves that finish territory.  Somewhat like endgame.]
