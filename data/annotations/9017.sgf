right, no need to live when you can still connect outside.

[rs][ss]C[very close. 

You had the lead until you lost the right side. 

You must put the safetey of your stones ahead of
ambitions of reducing your oppoents territory or attacking. 

Also, some basic shape will help you positino your stones
in dificult to attack positions. 

If you're stones are safe then you can focus your efforts on making 
your opponents stones weak. Territory will come naturally that way. 

good luck.];W[tt])

C[tough to live. 

you're already behind a bit once you die here. 

But there still are a few end game moves. 
Possible to catch up. 

Continuing to try and live inside black's territory at this point
won't hurt you. 

as long as each move you make requires a black response, 

Black's points will stay equal. 
This is because black is reducing his territory by 1 each time he responds.
He is gaining 1 point from your prisoner. 

So the net gain is zero.]))
