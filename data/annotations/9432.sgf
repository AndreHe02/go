C[onesickpup: hi
*aki8090*: Hi!];B[pd]C[Onesickpup.  Any comments you have would be appreciated.  I went through and gave my own comments to the game.  The fuseki clearly went south on me, if you have any helpful tips against black's setup that would be fine, but i am interested in improving in all phases of the game.]
;W[ep];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj]LB[kc:F][nc:A][de:D][cp:B][nq:G]C[Onesickpup.  I never do well against these and similar setups, maybe I should just try k16 here, but then he goes k4, d10 and he will then play in the middle next.

prana: I would play one of the marked stones. The san ren sei (the 3 black stones on the star points) is played very often, so you should have an idea of how to handle it. Playing A is the most common approach, and I show just one possible variation.]

(;W[nd];B[jd]
(;W[pf];B[oe];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[ne];W[md]TR[jd][pf]C[Onesickpup. I do not know the joseki here.
prana: it is playable, but I prefer black because the black marked stone seems better locateted than the white one.]
;B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[od];B[pe];W[kd];B[ke];W[je]C[Onesickpup.  Probably k17 was better but even after that move black's wall is daunting.
prana: k15 is aggressive, but If you like fighting it is ok. K17 is a bit submissive]
;B[jc];W[ie];B[hd];W[he];B[gd];W[ff];B[ed];W[ce];B[dd];W[cd]
C[Onesickpup. I was sure he would try something like g15 or e14 next.]

(;B[ec]C[prana: black e17 is a solid move. It gives a base, black now has no weakness]
;W[df]C[Onesickpup.  Now I feel like the position isn't quite as bad as before, I can still hold out hope of building my own counter "moyo".
prana: without extension this wall is not worth that much. black should play around c9 immediately]

(;B[kh]C[prana: this is too narrow to his own wall.]
(;W[kp];B[mp];W[kn];B[lb];W[mb];B[kb];W[nb];B[dp]
(;W[dq]TR[ce][df][ff]C[prana: Because of your wall on the left side, you should better play outside.]
;B[cp];W[cq]
(;B[eo]C[prana: black should make a base];W[fp]
(;B[bp]
(;W[en]C[Onesickpup.  This didn't work out so good, I should have just played at one of the big points around d10 or r4

prana: the left side is more important];B[fo]
(;W[gp];B[dn]
(;W[qp];B[qo];W[po];B[op];W[qn];B[ro]
(;W[rp]C[prana: this doesnt work. You should be careful with moves like this. They can be disastrous.]
;B[rn]C[Onesickpup.  When I played at r6 I had intended to play the variation, and then I noticed that that the game sequence was possibly much better and better chances to survive..
prana: ? 
There was plenty of space in the black mojo. Installing a living group should be no problem.]

(;W[qm]LB[qm:A][rm:B];B[rm];W[ql];B[rl];W[qk];B[oo]
(;W[ol]C[Onesickpup.  Not really sure if q6 was worthwhile, I could do that but then I imagine he would just kill r4 anyway and I would have to pick a move to run out away again.
prana: if connecting at q4 is sente, then you should play it. 
In this case, black probably wants to play safe and answers.]
;B[pn]C[onesickpup.  Seems overly cautious, but I might play this way as well if I were black.
prana: it is too slow. Good for w.];W[qj];B[pi];W[qi];B[ph]
;W[ml]C[Onesickpup.  At this point I was feeling much better about my prospects of having at least a tiny chance of winning, from being in a practically resignable position, still he has a lot of points on the bottom and a lot of influence still.

prana: black is ahead, but the left side is unsettled. You are still in the game.]
;B[lm]C[Onesickpup.  I thought about stuff like o6 and n5 here but it wasn't clear to me that these moves were more productive than the game line.]

(;W[ll];B[km];W[kl];B[jm]
(;W[jl]C[prana: you should avoid pushing from behind. Try to move faster, or play some sabaki to make living shape]
;B[im]C[Onesickpup.  I expected him to try a hane at some point here, I don't think I have many options but to keep crawling along with him.]

(;W[il]C[prana: again: too slow];B[iq]TR[cj]C[Onesickpup.  Not what I would have picked, but it is worth some points..
prana: it is huge, but I would prefer c10];W[ip];B[jq];W[hq]

(;B[kq]C[Onesickpup.  This was worth a fair amount of points for him I think but I am not certain it was the biggest point on the board as d10 is still open and I have a group yet that does not have any eyes.
prana: black could have played better. See variation]
(;W[ih]C[Onesickpup.  I thought about a play around d10 but in the end decided on this.
prana: you are behind in territory, so d10 (or c9) would have been much better]
;B[dk]C[Onesickpup.  So he gets there first and he is probably ahead quite a bit again at this point.
prana: now, the game is really good for black];W[ci]
(;B[jj]LB[cc:A][qh:D][cj:B][hl:C][jp:E]C[Onesickpup.  Not what I would have picked, but I certainly didn't succeed in exploiting the weakness of this move (if it is in fact a weak move!).
prana: a weak move in fact. black should play endgame (the marked moves) and win.]
;W[ij]
(;B[ji]C[Onesickpup.  J11 now was better.
prana: maybe. But black sould not fight, just play calm endgame...]
;W[ej];B[ii];W[hi]C[Onesickpup.  I had a plan here, I saw the cut h8 happening but figured my only chance was to try to stir up some kind of a fight.  In the end this is probably just a bad move.
prana: you are behind, so starting a fight is the only chance]
;B[ik];W[hj];B[hk]C[Onesickpup.  I think h8 is just fine for him, but maybe this move here is better.  Of course my plan was to try to kill the j7 stones to "save" my group but I don't think I can succeed in doing this against best play.]

(;W[hl]C[Onesickpup.  What else is there to do??
prana: hane seems to work];B[gk]
(;W[gl]C[prana: again slow. Try to find something faster...]
;B[fk];W[hn];B[hm]C[Onesickpup.  Here now I am getting the sinking impression that not only is he ahead on points even if I manage to save the group, he is probably going to kill the group to boot!]
;W[fl]C[prana: again, you push from behind. This exchange is very bad, think about it.]
;B[ek];W[gm]TR[ek][fl];B[gn];W[fn];B[go];W[ho];B[do];W[mn]C[Onesickpup.  Appears to capture the stones but..]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[nm]C[Onesickpup.  I missed this nice resource for him.]

(;W[mm];B[nl]
(;W[ok];B[nk]C[Onesickpup.  Certainly the tail of my dragon is quite dead, I manageto swindle it to life.]
;W[qh]
(;B[qf];W[qg]

;W[rk];B[se];W[sg];B[si];W[sh]C[prana: very good! white is alive.]

(;B[sk]LB[sd:B][sk:A]C[Onesickpup.  This lets me get away with a common ointoshi trick.  Even after I save this he is ahead by about 25 points I would guess.]
;W[sj];B[rj];W[ri];B[sl];W[sj];B[rb]
(;W[qb]C[prana: first push once (big endgame difference)];B[rc]
;W[ob];B[gi]C[Onesickpup.  He should have just consolidated his position and won comfortably, if he played at M3 for instance.]
;W[bk];B[bl];W[cl]
(;B[dl]C[prana: ? black is asking for trouble];W[bm];B[em];W[lq]
C[Onesickpup.  Now I get to make things complicated, he probably should still win but things work out in my favor.
prana: black already lost so much, the game is favorable for white now.]
;B[lp];W[mq];B[nq];W[mo];B[np];W[kr];B[jr];W[nr]
(;B[lr]LB[lr:A][mr:B]C[Onesickpup.  This looks like the way to capture for him.]

(;B[in]LB[in:A][ps:B]C[Onesickpup.  I must have had some psychological advantage here in that I must kill this group now - and since I was lost before anyway I had nothing to really lose, in that regard he should not have connected.]
;W[is];B[js];W[ps];B[rr];W[ls];B[ms];W[pa]C[Onesickpup.  It appeared to me that if I pulled this off I would be winning, there is no ko threat big enough now.
