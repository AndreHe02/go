C[Hanscom [12k?\]: Hi!


Seb: Hello,

my name is Sebastian.
My rank is about 6k and this is my first review. 
I will start my comments with "Seb:".

P.S.: Please note that in most cases there is no right or wrong. There are millions of possible ways to play in go.
I hope you can take some profit out of my review, i did so.

If you have any questions please let me know on my email

(;W[eo]LB[bp:B][gq:A]C[Seb: I think this move is not good.

this move doesnt built any base and leaves the right side completely open, although the corner is open at "B" anyway.

the second reason is, i think this move is too slow. You can develop your group faster by playing F3.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp]
(;W[cr]TR[hp]C[Seb: This move is more like an endgame-move where you need to tickle out the last points.

A fast development is more important in the opening phase.]

;B[qj]LB[ro:A]SQ[ql]C[Seb: I do those moves myself a lot and Im working on avoiding them.
The problem is that you need to protect your territory aorund "A", so you do
with the next move....];W[ql];B[pi]TR[ki][li][mi][ni][oi]SQ[je]
[ke][le][me][ne]C[Seb: ....but black jumps up and you need to try to get out of there with your stone. So you are struggeling to save one stone while black builds a wall at triangle or develops his territory at squared.]
;W[ph];B[oi];W[rj];B[ri];W[qi];B[rk];W[pj];B[qk];W[pk];B[rh]
;W[rl];B[sj]TR[ph][qh][qi]C[Seb. Now as a result of the move at R11 you have a weak group there.]

(;W[sl]TR[ed]C[Seb: unnessecary move, its more an endgame move.

As you can see in the variation you can protect this whole easily.
Better play elsewhere. (see triangled position for example)

You would loose some points by protecting, but you will earn a lot more by discovering new areas on the board, because there are so many free areas at this moment.]
;B[sk]
(;W[kc]C[Seb: Hm...dont really know about this move. So it is not an attack...black stones are too far away. Its like throwing in and look how black reacts.
But you give black the chance to attack you again.
So I would have prefered attacking and using sente];B[ld];W[hc]
;B[ec]LB[mb:A][je:B]TR[ld]C[Seb: These two stones are a good example for one important principle of go.
in english approximately "expanding by attacking"
Black is attacking your stones and you have to defend. But while he is attacking he builds territory and/ or good influence.]

(;W[me]TR[ph][qh][qi]C[Seb: Maybe your intension was to get connected to the marked group.
I would prefer one of the variations, because your group is not secure at all and I would spend the next move securing it.]
;B[le];W[md];B[lc];W[oh];B[ni]LB[id:B][nf:A]TR[lc][ld][le]C[Seb: Now, your group around "A" is really in trouble.
Your group at "B" has no good position, it cant really expand to the sides, only can jump into the middle.]

[me][nh][oh][ph][qh][qi]C[Seb: This move does nothing much, I think the group is already dead.
Maybe it would be better to concentrate on the two weak groups A and B.]
