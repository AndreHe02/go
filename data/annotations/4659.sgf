C[xxc : hi

this game was played on dgs from 08 sep 05 to 12 oct 05
white xxc : 7k
black pullush : 8k];B[qc];W[dd];B[cq];W[pp]C[a rather odd opening for black]
;B[pn];W[np];B[qp];W[qq];B[qo];W[rq];B[nn];W[kq]C[xxc : perhaps this one is slow and small

but :
i do not think b can have whole right with only one stone
this made cash (?)
reduce bottom for now

It's not terrible locally, but it's definnitely
not the biggest and best thing.   Black has
all but wrapped up the right side of the board,
and white ought to be thinking about minimizing
the damage there.];B[od]C[
this isn't great for black - it basicly insists
that white invade near q10.  Black should play
near there himself.];W[qi];B[ph];W[ql]C[
this is going to form a tight group that might
not even be alive.  Much better would be to
strengthen the white stone first by pushing at
r12];B[qh]C[too late now!  Good for black.];W[pi];B[ol];W[oh]
;B[og];W[oi];B[ng];W[rn]C[xxc : can't let b after P16

this group seems fine now ... and P7 goot target for latter]
;B[fc]C[the top side is so wide, white is sure to invade
and black will end up with very little.  You don't
always have to approach the corner directly.];W[jc]C[xxc : can't let top, right is too strong allready]
;B[cf]C[I would have pressed white first, probably M17];W[ee]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce]C[xxc : is this a must ?

lets cutting point in b shape

more like a "must not".  It's gote and leaves
white with a bad shape.];B[be];W[df];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[cg]
;B[de];W[ec];B[ep];W[dl];B[dg];W[ce];B[bf];W[ch]C[xxc : search to push b from D13 and then close upper side]
;B[dh]C[black really should not answer here, it just
invites white to get stronger.];W[di];B[fg];W[ei];B[fh];W[gd]
C[xxc : here it is

b had 2 weak groups now];B[cj];W[ci];B[bl];W[cm];B[hq];W[bm]
C[xxc : for safety of left group (necessary ?)];B[dk];W[ek]
;B[lc]C[xxc : here is the end !

from now, i do not have more follow up line :(
(as usual in most of my games)

i think w is quite well in this game, but i do not see how to go on with it

b have stilll 2 weak groups, but i do not find any way to attack them while getting good result


Up to this point, the game is not completely
unreasonable, it looks a little strange, but
it's all plausible.  

There are a couple big undesolved issues. 
Black has a some eyeless stones near  F12.  
EIther they will live somehow, or become the center
of a huge white territory.  The black stonesnear
Q6 and the white stones above it are unsettled.
It could become the case that everything lives,
or something big could die.  These
are the things that should be contested next.];W[rh]C[good start]
;B[qf];W[lo];B[lm];W[ml];B[ln];W[mj];B[mo];W[mp]C[this is a reasonable continuation to here.
Black has an eyeless (or probably one-eye'd
group that has to be attended to.];B[id]C[hello? Where does this move come from?  My
guess is that black figured his trouble with O6
and vicinity was over.  Wrong.   This would
be an opportunity for white to score big by
chasing the black stones, even if they ultimately
escape.];W[ic]C[defeding is stone is questionable, but 
not terrible.];B[ih];W[fq]C[this doesn't make a lot of sense.  Black
has two groups in need of eyes, but white
chooses to attack the black group which
has good shape and plenty of eye potential.];B[fp];W[gq];B[hp]
;W[hr];B[ir];W[gp];B[go];W[eq];B[dq];W[dr];B[cr];W[gs];B[iq]
;W[er]C[white is dead];B[ds];W[fo];B[ho];W[fn];B[do];W[dn];B[co]
;W[hm];B[jn]C[connecting everything together, black is ok.
Probably OK even if white F3 were alive (which
it is not).];W[ko];B[jm];W[jk];B[il]C[presumably trying to sneak up and rescue
the group above. Can't possibly work.];W[ik];B[hl];W[gm];B[gk]
;W[in];B[jo];W[gj];B[fj];W[fi];B[fk];W[ej];B[gi];W[hj];B[lk]
;W[lj];B[kk];W[kj];B[mk];W[kg]C[good idea for white.];B[jf]

;W[hf];B[ge];W[jd];B[he];W[if]
(;B[fd]C[silly move.  black has a whole lot of 
stones in the center and the only hope
to salvage anything is to escape, not
add to the pile of most likely dead stones.
This is a huge roll of the dice - no amateur
can tell what will happen.   

Sometimes making things complicated is the
 only thing, but here there is still a simpler option.
Black can reliably save something by playing
at M12];W[fe];B[gf];W[ie]C[big mistake.]

Result: W+0.5

White won only because of a black blunder
in the endgame.  Both players should play
more conservatively, and avoid depending
on reading ability.]N[RESULT])
