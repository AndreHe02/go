C[Bildstein: This game is one of those ones where no groups are killed, territories grow and settle, and the end game solidifies the boundaries. And I honestly don't know where I went wrong. I don't think I couldn't point out even a single move that was a mistake.]
;B[qc];W[dd];B[cc]C[Well, here is your first one. 
This isn`t the proper time for c17, you can play it later in the game, no need to hurry, just be patient and take another corner.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de]C[Bildstein: A bit unusual given that there was no stone around f17.


Yes, white made a  mistake here, he can build a lot of outside thickness while closing you in corner with very few points. And for this stage of the game this will be a tremendous advantage for him. That is why I said C17 was a mistake]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc]C[I think white better at C15 here to confine black in corner and extending his influence on the left side too.]
;B[cf]C[Bildstein: I was happy with the result in the top left corner.

yes, the result is good now but just because white made mistakes here]
;W[oc];B[pe]C[Bildstein: Trying to make some territory on the right side.]
;W[md];B[ph]C[maybe take another corner with this move, remember the order of play in fuseki? corner first, extending on side second and center later. There are two empty corner on the table.]
;W[jd];B[qp]C[Bildstein: Trying to make a moyo. I figured playing on the third line would mean that it was harder for white to break up my right side.

First, if you want to play for moyo, play on fourth line, third line is for teritory. Second, your right side could be easily be invaded, but it`s good you moved in one of the empty corners.]
;W[dq];B[do];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[dj]C[Bildstein: Again, trying to build a moyo.

Yes, here you are right played for moyo];W[oq];B[kq]C[Bildstein: White had a solid moyo at the top, and I didn't want him to get another one at the bottom. This play aimed to pincer the White stone at p3, while at the same time having room to create a base for itself at h3.


I don`t like this move. Yes, you have space to take a base but doesn`t put presure on p3, better to pincer or consider p4 or p5 to build your right side.]
;W[mq];B[pq];W[pm];B[hq];W[nn];B[ho];W[fn];B[dm];W[ip]C[Bildstein: I've come to realise that this peep is something of the standard attack against this formation of black stones. I think in hindsight that h5 would have been more effective at j5.

Yes, this is the standard attack];B[iq];W[hp];B[jp];W[io];B[jo]
;W[in];B[km];W[qj];B[qi];W[oj];B[rj];W[qk];B[or];W[op];B[qn]
;W[nr];B[cj]C[Hmm, I don`t know this seems too defensive and too slow. I think I`ll play E13 here, which will extend the moyo on the left while aiming to enter in upper side.]
;W[ij];B[lr];W[jr]C[Bildstein: I lived after White k2, but what if White had invaded at k2 before I played m2? Would I still have been able to live? I can't see that White j10 made that much difference, but as it was, I only just lived. Should I have defended earlier?


well, j10 aim to block your way out to center while begin to build center for white, just for consideration look at the variationto see how can this be done.]

Black~ 75 points
White~ 88 points+komi

so, white is in advantage and you can`t win the game making just reduction moves, you must try to destroy his central moyo, so you should take the risk and make a deeper move inside his moyo, but is hard at this point]

I think you should learn to count the points to decide what to do: 

           - if you are in the lead play safe and conserve your advantage like white did in this game
           - if it`s a close game try to see if reduction moves are enough to put you in the lead, if not, invade
           - if you are behind then must invade



I hope my advices was helpfull for you, if you have any other questions about game or my coments, feel free to mail me.
