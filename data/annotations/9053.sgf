C[Serge: Hi, I am Serge. Thanks for reviewing my game! I hope to learn a lot from this review. Even though I won I felt like I made a lot of mistake this game that I simply shouldn't have.

X: Hi! I'll mark my comments with "X:" since my kgs username is xue :)
Hopefully I can help you understand some things you can improve!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq]
(;W[qj];B[ql]C[Serge: Should I approach the other corner instead? Is that considered larger at this point?

X: This is actually the correct joseki opening! If you follow pro-koreans, apparently there are some very modern new fashions for this opening, but I think this is still the optimal way to go.]

(;W[qg];B[qf]C[X: Generally, attach if you're trying to live, don't touch if you want to threaten! R15 would have been better here.]
;W[pg];B[rf]C[Serge: Good? Is there something better than these two moves? Something that puts more pressure on the two stones?

X: Indeed, as mentioned one move ago, play farther away. If white jumps, jump with white and make lots of territory at the top (b:R15, w: P13, b:O16 for example), and if white tenuki, then start attacking (with Q12 for example).]
;W[qn]
(;B[pl]C[Serge: One point jump instead? I just wanted the group to be really strong since there were going to be two weak white groups.

X: 1-point jump I think would be too thin as you thought: white can simply connect underneath. However, a kosumi would be pretty good here and prevent the connection.]
;W[on];B[po]C[Serge: I feel like this attack is really clumsy and it causes my bottom to be smaller than it should.

X: I think the main point here is that this peep forces white to connect and become strong. Now your 2-stone pillar is trapped between 2 strong white groups! Was strong but became weak! Exactly the opposite of before: with b:Q7, white stones are stuck between strong black groups!]
;W[pn];B[mo]C[X: And another move on the lower side! Now the 2 black stones are really lonely...]
;W[nm];B[pj];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[rj];B[ni]C[Serge: This looks bad to me, but I am not sure what else to play.]
;W[pf];B[pe];W[nf];B[md];W[nh];B[ki];W[mh]
(;B[mi]C[X: AAAUUUGGGHHHH empty triangle. Please avoid empty triangles. T__T]
;W[lh]
(;B[li]C[X: Hmmmm. Very slow move. Try to achieve the same function with bigger moves. Black wants to protect cut, so....]
;W[lm];B[mn];W[mm]
(;B[nn]C[Serge: This was a bad move. What should I do instead? Jump left again? Solidify my shape?

X: Yes, again the empty-triangle. T__T
Why play this move though? Cannot cut, and forces white again to become stronger towards black's weaker group. Don't push your enemy to your weakness, push your enemy to your strength!]

;W[om]
(;B[mk]C[Serge: I was looking for eyeshape at this point. Worried that escaping again might cause too much damage to the other parts of the board.]
;W[ln]C[Serge: But maybe a defense around here was more Urgent?]
;B[lo]
(;W[jn]C[X: Oh wow, white is very very cautious.]
(;B[jp]C[Serge: See variation.];W[ko];B[kp]C[X: Indeed this is very good! indirect but more powerful move!]
;W[io]
(;B[fq]C[Serge: What's the correct move here?

X: Locally, that is one space too far, but globally, it is still the wrong move.
Looking at the whole board, what can you get here? 20 points? There are still entire sections of the board with a lot more potential, so why fight over 20 points, when you can just grab 50 points somewhere else? And more urgently, the dragon is still a bit risky.... should be easy to live, but still a liability right now.

Also look at white. White has so much potential, doesn't need to fight over 20 points yet.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[hq];B[ir];W[hr];B[gp]C[X: Ah, don't insist of living. Go straight for the corner here, or leave it for later. Still are 50-point areas!]
;W[hp];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]
;W[fr]C[X: Ok, this is a pretty decent result. Taking the corner is good.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj]C[X: This is very nice for black. Take a lot of territory on the side, and erase the potential of the white wall, and make it easier for black dragon to connect somewhere! This is a big mistake from white, his choice of joseki!]
;W[cl]C[Serge: Oh no... How do I deal with this invasion?

X: Although the kosumi seemed like a strong move, I think that's where you had to play differently.]

(;B[dm];W[dl];B[em];W[bo];B[co];W[bn]
(;B[cm]C[Serge: This move just let's him live? Is there something more severe?

X: I don't think so at this point.];W[bm];B[el];W[bj];B[ck]
;W[bk];B[dk]C[X: For once, empty-triangle is acceptable.];W[bl]
;B[gn]C[Serge: Saved two stones, but my left it ruined. Time to build up the center!

X: Good, good to be flexible!];W[go];B[fo];W[ho];B[gm];W[ch]
;B[dh];W[ci]
(;B[di];W[bg];B[bf]C[Serge: Probably better to take a larger point elsewhere.

X: Yes. Both white groups are alive already anyway, so no need to cut them (no added pressure).]
;W[ge];B[gg];W[jj];B[ml]C[X: For now, run. So easy to connect to center group anyway.]
;W[jc];B[lc];W[ke];B[jo]C[X: Why this? Just taking away liberties for yourself, now the cut at K3 is good for white.]

;B[lp];W[lr];B[mr];W[ks]
(;B[ms]C[Serge: Should take something larger... what is largest now though?

X: Sente is always larger! So, first play double-sente (is sente for you, would also be sente for your opponent), then play sente moves, then reverse-sente (not sente for you, but sente for your opponent and gote moves. For the last two, the rule of thumb is that a reverse-sente move is worth twice as much as a gote move, so a 3-point reverse-sente move is worth more than a 5-point gote move, but less than a 7-point gote move.

Without counting exactly that the best is, the following are all pretty good.]

Finally that left invasion got WAY to much. However I am not good at fighting invasions. Any tips are appreciated! Don't limit your feedback to my questions only. I bet I did a lot of other things wrong as well that I don't even know to ask.

Thanks again!

X: Overall I think it was a pretty decent game! White made a big mistake in choosing the direction when black approached the top-left, which gave you a big lead! Sometimes however I feel you lost track of the whole-board situation and instead tried to find the best local result. So first general feedback is:

- Keep the whole-board in mind! Make it a habit to take a step back and think "what is really important?"
There is a proverb that says "First, check if you have weaknesses. If you do, defend! (urgent move). Then check if your opponent has weaknesses. If he does, attack! If there are no weaknesses, take the biggest point (big moves)!". A couple of times you pushed white towards your weaker group, instead of defending the weak group (and pushing white towards your strong groups), but I think more importantly, is that when there were no weaknesses, you still played locally instead of going for the big moves. Try to keep that in mind and improve that!

Second, both you and your opponent did not play a very good end-game, playing even some 0-point moves! White could actually have taken back the game! Improving your end-game counting at this level will be very very powerful, since most kyu-level players (including myself) are not so good at it. It can make easily a 10-20 point difference, which is huge!]
