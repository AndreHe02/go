C[Zoli: My bigest question is, why can white get more territory than me? Which mistakes must I eliminate to get biger influence on board.

it wasn't the influence that was your problem...your problem is live and death in the corners...]
;B[dd];W[jd];B[dj];W[jj];B[gg];W[gh]C[this attack of white is strange...normally yo don't lay a stone next to another to attack, because you make the stone jou attack stronger...so maybe f6 would be better here for black]

(;B[hf]C[h8 is unusual too....probably i hadn't answered it bur  had attacked d4 with maye f4 to make your stone at g6 a little stronger...]
;W[fg];B[id]C[probably i would have played more something like f8 or h6...]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[he]LB[hg:B][ig:A]C[Gabi. I think this move is too agressive and  not good for whites position. More better  (and good) will be -I think-  J7 or H7.

yes you are right.. i woult think w:h7, b: g8, w: j7would have been better...]
;B[ge];W[hg]LB[if:B][ig:A]C[Gabi. This move is positionaly wake such as the 12-th.

this is a bad situation for w because there is no way to hold all your stones together with one move. i think j8 for a good move]
;B[if];W[je]C[Gabi. White must play this for saving the position - I think.

yes this 2 stones are very important for white so k9 was right]
;B[gf];W[hh]C[Gabi. Same as the previous move.
Black attacks the whites position well.];B[gd]C[i think g10 isn't a too dangerous cut]
;W[jg]C[Gabi. Finally! Not an strategical mistake.
This brings a little bit stability into the whites position.

yes nothing to say. a good move.];B[jc];W[kc];B[ic]C[j11 is muuuuuch too defensive. i think k12 would be btter here.]
;W[ei];B[di];W[dh];B[ej]C[e3 is to defensive again...why not f3?]
;W[fi];B[fj]C[instead of f4 i would like g3 more...];W[gj];B[gk]
;W[hj]C[in this situation white could have played h3 i think]
;B[ch];W[dg];B[cg];W[hk];B[fl];W[gl]C[too small now....and gote.]
;B[fk];W[hm];B[ce];W[ee];B[df];W[ef];B[ed];W[cc]C[Gabi. White begins an attak in the corner, not  without chances.

there you wanna live? now i want to see how....];B[dc]TR[dd]
[ed]C[Zoli: I don't know what to do to stop the white.

never play THIS form! d12 would have been better and white would probably die...]
;W[db]
(;B[bc]C[b11 is not wrong but at first jo should have played e12]
;W[bb];B[cd]C[you could have played instead of c10 , b10 directly]
;W[cb];B[bd];W[eb];B[fb];W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[gc];W[ab];B[kb]
;W[lc]LB[jf:A]C[Gabi. A  is better I think. This makes chances for black to attack.

no! m11 was the best you could do. if black had played there it would be really huge!the whole corner...and A isn't that dangerous i think.]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[lb];W[fe]LB[ke:A]C[Gabi. This is a pointless move. "A" move is very needed.

yes A is very important and f9 is 1. very small! and 2. gote!]
;B[fd];W[de];B[cf];W[eg]C[e7 is not neccessary];B[kd];W[ke]
;B[ld];W[le];B[mc];W[ck]C[do you know what an overplay is??? i think white has no chance sto live there...]
;B[cj]C[Zoli: What to do with white in the corner?];W[bk];B[dl]
;W[cl];B[bj];W[fm];B[em];W[dm];B[cm];W[bm];B[ak];W[dm];B[gm]
;W[dk];B[cm];W[fm];B[ek]C[Zoli: This was a mistake. I don't payed attention to my stone C1 in atari.]
;W[dm];B[gm];W[el]LB[hl:B][fm:A]C[Zoli: I hesitated between A and B. I think I choosed the worst move.

was alright! with B white would have really lived in the corner.]
;B[fm];W[bi];B[ci]C[c5 gives white live...ignore this stone you can still make liberties for your big groupd arround f3 with h2!
you shoulad have played a2];W[al]C[Gabi. White have now two eyes and this is his second successful attack in the corner.

well white is a magican he can make live where no live is possibly....]
;B[aj];W[hl];B[ff]TR[de][ee][fe][ef][dg][eg][fg][dh]C[Zoli: I wanted take the stones with triangles without counting the lifes of the group. Big mistake.

it isn't really possibly to take them....];W[dl]C[d2 is very small..only 0.5 points...i think j7 for bigger]
;B[ig];W[jh]LB[kh:A]C[Gabi. Big mistake(losing move) - "A" is a the right move.
After this white lose the game.

well...thats really a hard mistake but not easy too see...]

[af][bf][kf][lf][ag][bg][lg][ah][bh][ai][bi]C[well...from your basic tactics it was a good game. but you both have to learn to think a little longer whether moves which looks good in the first moment are really as good or whether there are still big cuts then. And please learn a little more Live and Death problems.]
