C[[am\] Hello, my name is Arnauld and I'm 4k KGS (nickname: milouz). I will do my best to review your game.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[qk]C[Wasn't sure if I sould enclose my corner at e3 or take my d19 point?

[am\] e3 is the biggest point.];W[eq];B[dj];W[cl]C[Thought i should extend in front of my enclosure

[am\] It's ok.];B[ck]LB[dl:A]C[[am\] Bad. White will play 'A' and black will be very weak.]
;W[dl];B[cg]LB[nc:C][ce:B][ci:A]TR[dj][ck]C[[am\] Black stones are very  vulnerable. Later you can invade in 'A'.
Now, you have the sente and it's very difficult to say what move is the best. The white stone in the corner is a bit weak and I would probably reinforce it with B which put pressure on black. But an approach around C is good and perhaps bigger.]
;W[nd]C[[am\] ok];B[oe]C[[am\] I think it's a black mistake but I do not know how to play against it.]
;W[ne]LB[jc:A][kd:B]C[[am\] Maybe a bit heavy. Note that the 2 stones are floating without any base and then are vulnetables. I would have play something like A or B]
;B[og];W[jd]C[[am\] good. Help the 2 stones.];B[bd]TR[dd]C[[am\] Your stone must be defended now. There are lot of points in the corner.]
;W[nq]C[[am\] It's another big point, sure. But I think C17 was really urgent.]
;B[po];W[jp]C[[am\] ok];B[gq]C[[am\] Bad. Black should thing of developping is own moyo or taking corner upper left]
;W[iq]C[[am\] Good. Now white is reinforced and black is very weak.]
;B[go];W[eo]LB[fc:A]C[trying to "make territory while attacking here

[am\] No, it's not good. You make only very small territory. I think less that 10 pts. C17 is huge ! A black move around A would be devastating and is really more that 10 pts.]
;B[fn]C[should I play next at f8?

[am\] Black is very weak but it won't be easy to kill him or to gain anything valuable. Upper left corner is the best.]
;W[en];B[fl];W[ek];B[ej];W[fk];B[gl];W[in]LB[lq:A]C[trying to "make territory while attacking here

[am\] Yes, but where ? 'A' is still very weak and you make no territory at all.]
;B[il];W[hj];B[jj];W[hl];B[hm];W[hk];B[im]TR[og][jj][qk][il]
[po]C[[am\] Big loss for white who has gained almost nothing. Black is alive and triangle stones make a beautiful sphere of influence. Black is largely ahead.]
;W[pl]CR[jm][km][ln][mn][op]LB[cc:D][qi:C][qm:B][no:A]C[Thought I would try to reduce the black territory at the left edge and strengthen the lower edge white group

[am\] The idea is good, but your stone is a bit deep in black moyo. I tried to draw with circles the frontier between the 2 moyo. Your move should have been near that edge. Perhaps I would have played A because white are a bit weak now. Maybe something was also possible with B and C. But D is still huge.]
;B[ql];W[pk]LB[pm:A]C[[am\] you should have played A. It will be hard for you if black plays A.]
;B[pj];W[pn]LB[oo:A]C[[am\] Mmmh... if black play A, I don't see how you can make your 3 white stones living. I think you should have played near o7 or o8 to run threw your white territory.]
;B[qn];W[nn]TR[pk][pl][pn]C[[am\] still very weak. see variations]

(;B[kn];W[lo]C[[am\] ok];B[ko];W[kp];B[np];W[op]C[[am\] ok]
;B[no];W[oo];B[oq];W[mq];B[pp];W[pm]C[just a dumb move.  Not paying careful enough attention I guess

[am\] That kind of mistake appends sometimes, even to me :-) 
By being stronger, you will do less.];B[on]C[[am\] sic :_-(]
;W[om];B[qm];W[mm];B[mn]
(;W[nm]C[[am\] really difficult for white. see variation];B[ln]
C[should i play at n5 next?

[am\] No, you should try to make your white stones living and you can't kill black.]
;W[jk]C[trying to connect my whiye group on the left edge

[am\] ok];B[mo]LB[ik:A]C[[am\] Black should have cut !!!];W[kl]
LB[ik:A]C[[am\] 'A' was a chance to connect and save everythings.]
;B[lm];W[ll];B[mk];W[ml];B[jn];W[ik];B[kj];W[oj];B[pi];W[oi]
;B[oh];W[mi];B[lh];W[mh];B[mg]LB[dd:A]C[[am\] During that game, black and white fight for very small territories while white is so weak and the corner so huge.]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[lg];B[nh];W[kg]C[trying to surround tehe black midle group

[am\] ok. It seems logic but white is still weak. See variations]

(;B[jh];W[if];B[jg];W[jf];B[hh];W[fh];B[gg]C[[am\] none of you saw the threat. So, it's a running battle. White is really gaining territory now. Very good for white !]

[am\] Ok, it's the end of the game and of my review. My advices :
- try to count amount of territory gained so that you don't fight for small points
- practice tsumego and tesuji

Feel free to ask for any questions.
See you and enjoy go ! :-)])
