Nomadic [11k\]: SF];B[pp]C[M: Hi, I'm Mishuu, 4k on KGS. You can ask me for any questions you have on KGS or by mail.

;B[ep]
(;W[pf];B[nf]
(;W[md]LB[qc:A]C[M: This move looks too tight, to close to the black stones. Black can settle his group easily with A.

I suggest you some variations.];B[ob];W[jd]C[M: Very good move. You keep your stones safe.]
;B[ce];W[cg]TR[dc][ec][fc][gc][hc]C[Nomadic [11k\]: is c 13 a true play when should i pincer like this?

M: C13, or one-space pincer, is the most severe answer to a kakari like C15. 

In this case, this is of course a good move which give you the chance to develope the top side. 

You can play this kind of pincer when you want to get some profit around the triangle stone, and you are ready to fight.]

(;W[db]LB[lb:A]C[Nomadic [11k\]: was not sure if i should answer c18

M: D18 is certainly big, but be careful. You are protecting an area which is still open to a black invasion (around A). So take the sente and play in a free place.

See variation.];B[qc];W[pd];B[pc]
(;W[pj]LB[oe:A]C[M: W28 is big, but you missed a good cutting point at A. See var.]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[og];W[pg];B[pi];W[qi];B[ni];W[oj];B[lb]C[Nomadic [11k\]: what is the best answer lost some points there

M: Seems that M17 is the better way to keep some territory there. See var.

That said, the cut at A is still possible and sente. You could then protect at M17. See var.]

(;W[mc];B[mb];W[jb];B[kc];W[lc];B[kd];W[jc];B[ke];W[dk]C[M: This is a good extension.]
;B[co];W[qm];B[ro];W[gq];B[er];W[jq];B[hq]C[M: B53 is an overplay, here. You could punish him (see var.)]

(;W[ol]LB[qq:A]C[M: This is a small move, you are following black where HE wants to play. Take the initiative. At this stage, Black got the four corners. 

An invasion near A may be possible, and even you die, you would lose nothing.]

;B[or]C[M: You don't have to answer here. You have almost captured two stones (they are in atari), and yours keep 2 liberties, so you are not in a hurry to save your stones. Play wherever you want, or at least around ther corner.

See var.]

M: Not overplay at all. Black made a good wall in the sequence before, and you break almost everything here. Your move is quite close to your stones, and can be useful if black manage to cut at A.]

Nomadic [11k\]: trying some points
Goec [11k\]: )];W[nd];B[oc];W[tt];B[tt]C[Goec [11k\]: thx
Nomadic [11k\]: thx

M: Anyway, it was a good game. By protecting only where you need, you could win this game easily. Moreover, you showed some attacking and yose skills, I think. Just try to think more, to read more before playing : you will sometimes see that where you would play a "normal" move, there could be a good tesuji :)

Maybe some advices ? 
* You should study some basic josekis, at your level I think you are ready for that. Do not learn them by heart and try to understand these moves. If you can't, try at a higher level. 

* When you see that your opponent is weak somewhere, don't hesitate to attack, cut his stones. Spend more time to find a good squizzing move (I found 2 or 3 moves for you in this game). 
By attacking ennemy stones, you will make profit for sure, like I showed you.

* If you have enough time, at the final stage, try to forget "useless moves". It can give you some precious points to win a game ;)

If you have any question, or look for a teaching game, contact me :)
