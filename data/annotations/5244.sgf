C[Thank you a lot for reviewing my game. This game was very close and both my opponent and I made several mistakes. So I want you to point out every mistake and show me a better path. In this game I played white. My comments and questions are marked as "[\]>:".

Hello reviewee. I'm 3k on KGS (Babibo), and around 3k in France. 

This was a very simple game, with few mistakes, but very big ones :). Both players played very solid, which makes it hard to comment. I think you should try to play less solid, and try to keep sente instead. 
I didn't comment the yose, because I'm not very strong at that part of the game. 

C U !

(;B[nd];W[pf];B[qc];W[pc];B[qe];W[pe];B[qd];W[qg]C[The result is probably even, but white's wall works well with the san ren sei, so I have a little preference for white's position]
;B[rg]
(;W[rh]C[doesn't seem possible here. You are mistaking yourself with the san san joseki, but this is a detail.]
;B[qh];W[pg];B[ri];W[ph];B[qi]LB[pi:A]C[[\]>:Maybe better at T12?

No, I think R11 is a good move. When S14 is a dangerous move, then S12 is better. But here, R11 creates a weakness at A (Q11) and has better influence on the side.]
;W[cn];B[dk]
(;W[en]C[[\]>:Would a double kakari at F3 or F4 have been better?

The side you're interested in is the left side, because you will then build a big moyo. So E6 is perfect.

Moreover, F3 or F4 aren't in my joseki book. Have a look at the variations, and you'll see that a double kakari in this position would result in white having 2 weak groups in black's sphere of influence (bad...)]
;B[fp]
(;W[gn]C[[\]>:28 feels bad. Maybe at D11?

I don't know if G6 is bad. It looks pretty sente on the side (H4 completely destroys black's potential on the bottom side)

Of course, playing G6 gives black a lot of territory if he answers, so you must be sure to get a compensation by attacking D9. B4 was much simpler than G6]

(;B[cf];W[fd]C[Good move.];B[ci];W[hp]LB[gp:A]C[I suppose A would have worked too.]
;B[hq];W[iq]
(;B[gp];W[ip];B[hr];W[in]LB[jp:A]C[wonderful result for you. The A stone was hurt a lot. J6 looks slow, however]
;B[cc]
(;W[cd];B[bd];W[dc]
(;B[bc]LB[cb:D][qn:C][cq:A][nq:B]C[D is gote. Better play A B or C, or kill O16 stone that still has a lot of aji.]
;W[cb]C[[\]>:Did this have been necessary?

This move is gote. This was a big mistake.];B[jc]C[[\]>:Very surprising for me.

Well when you want to live where the opponent is stronger, it is good to attach to the opponent's stones. It usually creates a messy fight where black can make "sabaki". 
The theory is simple and easy to use in your games : in such a position, black can sacrifice stones, because all he wants is to have at least one living group in the area. White, however, can't sacrifice any stone. If he does, usually, black will live. So black should play very lightly and not be afraid to hane everywhere, while white will usually play very strong moves, unless he's sure he can kill everything.]

(;W[kd]TR[pc][pd][pe][pf][pg][ph]C[... According to the theory, playing nobi is good. However, I'd have played J17 :)

Don't use walls to make territory (in the end, you have around 10 points in that area), but to attack instead. So L16 is wrong direction]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[lb];W[mc];B[mb];W[nc];B[id]LB[ic:A]C[black lives easily, and you have nothing. However, black overplays here. He should have played A and live.]

(;W[hc]LB[ic:B][ie:A]C[This is terribly wrong ! 

H17 is "aji-keshi" : it eliminates weaknesses in black's position while white gets almost nothing from his move. It was much better to cut ! Once black has connected at B, you can't even play at A...]
;B[ic];W[ie];B[hb];W[hd];B[he]C[this cut is a little painful.]
;W[if];B[gf]C[Mmmh. Strange shape by black.];W[gb];B[ia];W[jb]
;B[kb]LB[nb:A]C[don't forget A is sente. You missed it during the yose.]
;W[ge]C[[\]>:I now I have a terrible weakness at G17. And I didn't play there for a long time. Very risky.

I'm not sure it is that risky. See variation];B[hf]
(;W[ff];B[gh];W[ig];B[hh];W[bp];B[cq]LB[pi:C][qn:B][nq:A]C[See variations. I can't decide which move is better. Usually, B is wrong because white can't make any territory there, but since black can cut at C, he probably can make a big territory around B]

(;W[bq]C[[\]>:The push may have been to premature.

It is very big indeed. But you're right : K11 is big too. But the bigger point is something around O3, I think, because it attacks the lonely Q4 stone. See variations]
;B[ji]C[[\]>:This is the point I should have taken.];W[kf]C[This move is very slow.]
