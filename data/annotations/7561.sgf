C[Hi dear reviewer,

I'm playing black on this game. My oppennent gave me a nice wall that i couldn't use to gain much. Could you give me some advice on using it to gain profit ?

Other comments are also welcome,

Thanks !

R: Hi! My name is Roland, and I'll review your game. I'll prefix all my comments with R:

R: Please don't take anything I write as absolute truth. Always try to verify my claims, especially when I present tactical variations. It's not that unlikely that I miss a move, too ;).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qp]C[Here I was a little lost. I thought aboit Q4, but didn't want to engage in a pushing battle.]
(;B[oo]C[So I chose this move to get ahead if white tries to push anyway

R: I think this move is OK. See also variation.];W[pn];B[po]
C[R: This is bad, it only strengthens your opponent. You should only play this kind of move when you actually want to cut, or when you need it to live. In this position cutting is not possible, and your group is not in any immediate danger of being killed, so it's best to just skip this exchange.]
;W[qo]C[R: After this exchange, you're back at a joseki position, but usually it is reached by a different order of moves. See variation for a possible continuation.]
(;B[dd]C[This was probably an overplay, i'm not sure about my lower group security

R: This is OK. See variation for next white move.]
(;W[cc]C[R: Too early. This is bad for white.];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce]
;W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg]C[Here's the main topic of the game. My oppennent gave me a nice wall for a very low cost, but I didn't manage to use it properly.]
(;W[bg]C[R: Very bad for white. White is already alive in the corner, so this move is not necessary. It only gets a single point of territory, and makes the black wall much stronger.]
;B[ch];W[bi]
(;B[ci]C[R: Good. Your opponent is giving you a huge wall for just one more point of territory per stone. You could also try to jump ahead. See variation.]
;W[bj];B[cj];W[bk];B[ck];W[cl]C[End of the wall. What to do next ? I wondered if i had to let my wall alone or play using it. The moves I was considering were F3, R9 or R8, or an extension from the wall.

R: R9, R8 and K16 are all very good ideas. I'm not sure about F3. See variations.]
(;B[jd]C[R: Very good. May be the best move. See variations for alternatives.]
;W[gc]C[R: Overplay. The black wall is too strong.]
(;B[cb]C[R: This doesn't threaten white, and gives a free forcing move. See variations.]
;W[eb];B[db];W[ib];B[jb];W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[ie];W[he];B[je]
;W[ge]
(;B[ee]C[R: White can't cut here. See variation.];W[ec]C[R: This does nothing, better to get out.]
;B[fd]C[R: White is already alive, so it's better to tenuki.]
;W[gd];B[fc];W[fb]C[I'm not sure if this exchange is fair or favorable for white. He lives, but I still have a nice area on the top right.

R: White got just 6 or 7 points from this invasion, and you got another big wall facing the top right. I'd say this is a huge success for black ;)]
;B[fq];W[er]
(;B[eq]C[Ok, kogo's joseki dictionnary list my move as an "amateurish mistake" :)
But I don't like the other moves very much. What shoud I have done ?

R: This move just solidifies the connection. It does nothing for black, but helps white. It's a similar mistake as Q5, usually you should play this move only when you want to cut. Better just skip this exchange, and play F2 directly. See variation.]
;W[dq];B[fr]C[R: And here is the real problem with the forcing move: White doesn't need to answer this move. It's a big move, but it still is endgame. There are more important areas on the board. If you had played F2 directly, without pushing at E3 first, white couldn't ignore so easily.

R: See variation.]
(;W[dr];B[jq];W[mq]
(;B[mp]C[R: Don't touch the stones you want to attack. You are only making white stronger. You also have to watch out for the cut. See variations on this and the next move.]
(;W[np];B[nq];W[lp];B[mo];W[oq];B[nr];W[no];B[nn];W[op];B[pp]
;W[lo]
(;B[mn]C[R: Better capture directly. See variation.];W[mr];B[or]
;W[kq]
(;B[kr]C[R: This move is saying "I want to kill". But you can't kill white as long as the group can run away. So first try to shut white in, then try to kill. If you shut white in and white manages to live with 2 or 3 points, it's a huge success for black. With this move, you're just helping white escape.

R: See variation.];W[jp]
(;B[lr]C[R: White doesn't have an eye here, and the two stones are not worth that much. You are just giving white the opportunity to sacrifice them, and a lot of sente moves along the way. See variations.]
(;W[jr];B[iq];W[lq];B[ir];W[ip];B[dl]C[R: Very big point, but gote. The attack on the right side is still possible, and it would surprise me if it wasn't sente so you could come back to this point later ;)]
;W[hp];B[gq];W[cm];B[dm]
(;W[cn];B[dn];W[do]
(;B[fg]C[Probably too small, but my wall didn't have any eye yet, so i was a bit afraid.

R: There is no need to worry. See variations.];W[qj]C[R: Now white got the chance to defend. Compare this with the last variation of the previous move. The difference is huge.]
(;B[qq]C[R: Wrong direction. You are already definitely alive on this side, and the corner is not that big. See variations.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[rp];B[qg]C[R: This move is not so good. It doesn't really threaten the white group, and it doesn't completely secure the corner. Either you play R12 to threaten an attack, or you play R15 or R16 to prevent the 3-3 invasion. I think R12 is best in this situation.]
;W[ol];B[pm]C[R: This just helps white solidify the position. Better just skip this exchange. At the moment there is no good attack, but you never know what opportunities arise later, so keep your options open ;)]
;W[qm];B[om];W[pl]C[R: Now the white position is completely solid, there is no chance to attack it.]
(;B[ln]C[R: Again: You are already strong in that area, and this move helps white solidify the position.]
;W[kn];B[ko]C[R: Again, you're trying to kill. I don't think it is possible to kill white here. You have to try to surround white first.]
;W[jo];B[ms]C[R: You are already alive on both sides, so you don't need this move. Ok, it is sente, but it doesn't gain you anything. Better to just skip the previous two moves, and attack white on a larger scale.]
;W[kp];B[gm]C[R: Good. Although this move would have been even better if the white group would still be weak.

R: The problem with this position is that all white groups are more or less alive. The top and right group already have two eyes, and the bottom group shouldn't have problems making a second eye when necessary. So at the moment you can't really do anything with your strength.

R: But you're still ahead on the board, so white pretty much has to invade at the top right at some point in order to have a chance.]
;W[in];B[im]C[R: Better keep a bit of a distance, R8 for example. This is giving white forcing moves.]
;W[jm]
(;B[hn]C[R: Still trying to kill?];W[il];B[hm];W[kl];B[jk];W[jl]
;B[nl]C[R: Very small.];W[hk];B[ql]C[R: Doesn't work... If you want to play in that area, better play P9 directly. But that's small.]
;W[qk];B[rl];W[rm];B[ok];W[pk];B[mj];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi];B[og]
C[R: Big point. You could have played that directly 15 moves ago ;)]
(;W[pb]C[R: I'm not sure if this is supposed to live, with the wall along the K column. The 3-3 invasion is safe in that case, see variation.]
(;B[qc]C[R: This tries to kill. While this time it seems possible that white actually dies, it is still risky, because when white lives you lose the game. See variation.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[ra]
(;B[sb]C[R: See variation.];W[pc];B[qd];W[nc]C[Here come's the main battle. I think that if white lives, black lose the game. He lived :(

R: The battle started 7 moves ago. You just gave white a headstart ;)]
(;B[nb]C[R: This helps white.]
(;W[ob]C[R: Mistake.];B[mb];W[od]
(;B[nd]C[R: This is no eye, so this move does nothing. White has no eyes yet, so just cut off the escape route.]

;W[lh];B[lg]C[probably the losing move. L14 or K12 instead ?

(;B[kg]C[R: What are you trying to do with this move? You can't save these stones.

(;B[ig]C[R: See variation.];W[jh]C[R: White lives.

R: Now go back to the variation at the beginning of the battle, where white lives small in the corner and compare. Here white lives with 8 points (4 territory and 4 prisoners), and black has around 10 points at the right side. In the other variation, white has about 5 points in the corner, and black has around 15 points of territory, plus some potential for expansion. This would probably have been enough to win the game.]
;B[ji]C[R: From here it's just endgame.

R: A small summary:

You actually played very well in this game strategically.

Your biggest weakness seems to be attacking and fighting. Usually, you shouldn't use a wall to make territory directly. Instead it is better to use the strength of the wall in fighting, to gain something somewhere else. In that respect, you played very well. For example, notice that white made only 5 points of territory from the invasion in front of your big wall, and you got a huge moyo in the top right. That's exactly how a wall should be used.

The problems were with the technique while attacking. You often attack with contact moves. But contact moves make both you and your opponent stronger. That makes them good for defense, but when you are attacking, you don't want that. You are already strong, and you want the group under attack to stay weak.

Another problem is that you often play as if you want to kill the group under attack. But you can't kill a group as long as it still has room to run away. It is almost always correct to shut the group in first, and let it live small. If you can still kill it afterwards, all the better, but shutting it in first is important. And if you can't shut it in, at least chase it around while making territory or influence along the way. The point is to keep it as weak as possible for as long as possible. Trying to kill and failing to do so will most likely make the group definitely alive, and you don't want that to happen, at least not as long as you haven't shut it in completely.

In the top right you missed a few opportunities to kill the group. To become better at this kind of situation, there is only one answer: Tsumego. Because sometimes it is necessary to kill in order to have a chance. After around move 140 you had no choice but try to kill. But the general theme is the still same: First make sure you shut in, only then you can kill. This is especially true as long as the group has no eyes. The opponent can only make one eye at a time, there is no need to prevent that as long as he can't make a second ;)]
