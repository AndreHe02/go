GC[Game analysis by Steve Fawthrop, 5D. 10th Aug. 2002]

C[hello,  Is it possible to give some comments on my opening and middle-game moves? Thx.

I think I lost the game because I made a mistake in the lower left corner (...and as a result, my group was dead).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[jq]LB[jp:A]C[This low move seems inconsistent in this opening.  Black is clearly aiming for a moyo game with his san-ren-sei and White has played a 4-4 point.  These would seem to indicate a move at 'A' instead.  The low move played leaves White open to various capping plays to expand Black's moyo.]
;B[jd];W[nq]LB[fd:C][ce:B][de:A]TR[jd]C[Although there is nothing wrong with this move, a shimari at the top feels better to me.  It is hard for White to fight a good answer to Black 'A' next. 'B in respond would just help Black for a moyo at the top with the nadare, and 'C' does not have anything to look forward to with the triangle stone on the board.]
;B[jj]LB[de:A]C[This seems to early.  It looks as though Black is playing a handicap game. At the very least play a kakari at the top as a kiakshi before playing this.  Of course, in respond to the kakari, White may play a line which forces Black to respond, but Blakc should be able to find a variation which ends in sente is he really wants to plat tengen.  I would play at 'A' instead of this move.]
;W[qc]C[Too early. Black's configuration does not lend itself to completion in one move to this is not urgent. The left side is more important.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
(;B[pb]LB[nb:A][oc:C][od:B]C[This is a nonsense move. The only possible explanation for this move is that Black does not like the variation starting at 'A', but then he should probably have played at 'B' instead of 'C'. There is actually nothing wrong with the variation.]
;W[qb];B[nb];W[pa];B[nc]C[Black does have nice thickness, but in gote.]
;W[qj]LB[rd:b][qi:B][qk:a][no:A]TR[ce][ci][dn]C["I don't know which direction to take but I took 'a' because: - it helps my hoshi stone and, - 'b' is an annoying move for w (ko)
Is this thinking correct?"

First of all, this is a panic move by White. There is no need to invade Black's moyo at this stage. The left side is still to be played. White has a sente move at 'b' as well as a nice move at 'A'.  He can also invade the lower sright corner, so there is no need to precipitate a fight at this stage.  Any of the triangle moves on the left side would be good for White.  Having siad that, Black best approach is the settle the position quickly on sente and play a shimari in the top left.  The lower right quadrant has little prospect of territory for Black so it makes little sense to try to claim any there, so 'a' has to be wrong.  See the two variations which result from Black 'B'.  Obviously there are others, but these are representative and favorable to Black.]

(;B[qk];W[pk];B[ql];W[oj];B[pi];W[oi];B[ph]LB[oh:A]C[Black can resist with 'A'.]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[oh];B[og];W[ng];B[of];W[nl]LB[nk:A]C[If W is trying to protect both cutting points he must play 'A']
;B[np]LB[pq:A]C[What is Black's aim here?  Both the standard joseki result in Black getting the corner in gote, but he can do that just as effectively with 'A' and have better aji against the White stones. This move makes no sense when White has a position above, unless that position can be attacked. I think that would be overly optimistic here.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[mo]
(;B[nn]LB[mn:A]C[This may be necessary, but it just feels wrong.  First of all, the standard joseki move it at 'A', so Black is not putting as much pressure on White to the left as in the standard sequence.  Second, and perhaps most improtant, it is not sente.  Third, if White continues to press at 'A' then Black has no good answer. Black 'A' is better as it keeps White separated and gives some prospect of attack.  Black has nothing to fear from the cut.]
;W[mh]C[Seems slow.  The one stone this protects is not crucial.]
;B[ce]C[At last!];W[gc]C[Nice move - stabilizes the White group in one move, which is necessary when White has an unsettle group on the right.]

(;B[cc]LB[fc:B][fd:A]C[Not joseki.  Black should exchange 'A or 'B' first. See variation.]
;W[cb];B[dd];W[ec];B[bc];W[bb]
(;B[cn]LB[mn:A]C[This move just feels wrong to me but it is hard to say exactly why.  The white group to the right is still unsettled and a low move at this point seems to ignore that fact.  I have my eye on the point 'A' and black needs a strategy to exploit that.]
;W[cl]LB[cq:A]C[Seems a little hasty, but as White is behind perhaps it is necessary.  Black cannot play 'A' - see variation.]

(;B[en];W[fp];B[dk];W[dl]
(;B[el]LB[ck:A]C[Seems like 'A' would be better. I looked at 3 variations, but there are others.]
;W[ck];B[dj];W[cj];B[di];W[ch]
(;B[eg]LB[dh:A]TR[ce][eg]C[Keeping on pressing at 'A' feels better. The relationship between the triangle stones is not good.]
;W[cg]
(;B[ge]LB[fc:B][fd:A][df:C][em:a]C["I though i could handle the cut 'a' by invading the corner."

A better solution than this move, is to exchange "A' for "B" in sente and then connect at 'a'.   After the A-B exchange, White C does not work.  Also, this move does not have a good relatoinship to the surrounding Black sotnes]
;W[em];B[fm];W[dm];B[fl];W[dn];B[cq]LB[mj:B][mn:A]TR[em]C[Letting White get the marked stone has turned the game in his favor. The black stones in the center are no longer working to their full potential.  Except for the group in the right center all of white's stones are secure, and that group is not easy to attack. Black really needs to find a way to play 'A' in sente before attacking at 'B' and that involves finding some threats against the White territory at the bottom.  First, however, Black needs to find a way to deal with the corner in sente.]
;W[dq]C["So, here I don't even get a ko. Which moves are better?"

There are a lot of possiblities, but the move played is too heavy and inflexible.  Black is ahead in this game if he lives in the corner.  If he does not live but can get two moves elsewhere he should maintain the lead.  There Black should play so as to keep sente and maintain the potential for live.  See all the variations shown. They are just a few possiblities I put on the board , and not necessarily the only ones or the best ones, but designed to show a feeling for how the game should go.]
