VALE: Hi! My name is Vale and I'll do the review for you in this game. I'm very sorry for my bad english, I hope you're able to understand what I'm talking about ;) ! I'm using the KGS CGoban3 SGF-Editor and if you don't do it too maybe some markers are different than i told in the reviewing text (e.g "I'm talking about a stone marked with a triangle and on your screen it's a circle"). But I hope it will not cause any problems :)]

(;W[fp]LB[ep:B][fp:C][eq:D][fq:A]C[VALE: This (C) is the first move that is not perfect. Better moves instead are A or B. Your move at C leaves a weakness at D, where black can play later in the game.]

(;B[ci]
(;W[op]LB[ec:A]C[VALE: I would  play A here. This is THE MOVE black wants to do. If black gets a stone at A it would be perfect for him.]
;B[ec]LB[qj:D][po:F][op:A][qp:B][jq:C][pq:E]TR[cd][ci][dm][cn]
[do]SQ[fp]C[VALE: So good for black. And on the lower side the formation looks not that good. White still needs a stone at C and D. And additionally the lower right corner would be much better with the marked stone if A and B where at F and F.]

(;W[pf]LB[jc:B][qf:A]SQ[ec][cd][ci][dm]C[VALE: I think A would be better here because you need some territory, black has so much on the left side. You have only some in the lower corners. You can also consider a move at B instead to attack the marked formation in the future.]
;B[nd]
(;W[fn]LB[pf:B][fn:A][jq:C]C[VALE: This move (A) is... ok. But I think there are much more important places right now. First you should care about B. Actually A maybe would be better at C.]
;B[lp]C[(VALE: This move looks kinda strage...)];W[jq]LB[lp:A]
[jq:B]C[VALE: Good answer. The exchange A B was bad for black.]

LB[jc:D][pf:A][ph:B][pk:C]TR[ec][cd][nd][nf][ci]C[VALE: I would be scared about this if I was white. The marked area looks HUGE. and A and B are weak. Bad for white! White wants to play C here, but maybe it's too slow. so D is a good option here perhaps.]

(;W[jj]LB[jc:A]C[VALE: This move looks like a missclick. It would be much better to invade at A instead.]
;B[oj]LB[pf:A][ph:B][oj:C]TR[jj]C[VALE: White looks too bad. A and B are in danger and the marked stone looks useless, especially after C.]

(;W[oi]LB[qj:A]C[VALE: Wrong way! This helps black to get a strong wall. Better A!]

;W[jd];B[jg]
(;W[lc]LB[gc:A][hc:B][lc:C][jd:D]C[VALE: It looks like there is more space in the other direction (A)... And after this move (C) black will play at B FOR SURE and the white formation looks too bad. So: C is a bad move here.]
;B[hc]C[VALE: Very bad for white.];W[nb];B[ob]
(;W[oe]LB[hd:A][me:B]C[VALE: This only helps black to get a thicker wall... bad for white. You need moves like A or B now.]

suparixi [8k\]: thx :)

VALE: All in all you made one big mistake in the opening (A), you had some reading issues (you died at the top for no reason) and you made one or two wrong tactical decisions (you had to invade earlier at the upper side and made a wrong decision at the left side).
I hope you can learn a bit from my review.

You didn't write questions in the SGF-File itself. If you have some questions at some certain points you can always ask me!

Good Bye :)
