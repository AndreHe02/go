B: The corner is still open. I prefer to extend to A or B];W[dj]

;B[le];W[ke];B[kf];W[me];B[kd];W[lc];B[ne];W[qi]C[B: Black's play on the top side is very slow. White took the advantage here, but you have to be careful with your central group.]

B: It's too bad that you made this mistake. Overall, you play very well and punish your opponent slow play well. 

About the general flow, I'm not sure why you don't like it. If you play even game more often than handicap game, I think that is why you feel uneasy about the flow of this game. I think the game is usual for a handicap game.White have to play here and there to chase black's early advantage, while black will try to keep the advantage and convert it to a victory.

This is the end of my review. Happy New Year. Hope you improve more in 2012 :)
