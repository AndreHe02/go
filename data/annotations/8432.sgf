C[Hi there, my name is Michael and I'll be reviewing your game.

Just as a helpful tip, please let me us know in the future which specific parts you want us to review.  I'll do my best, but I might miss something that you wanted to ask about.

If I went into a little too much detail, I apologize.];B[cp]
;W[pd];B[qq];W[dd]
(;B[md]LB[pf:D][qf:C][ep:A][fp:B]TR[cp]C[When you have an unbalanced corner, a follow up move is urgent.  More urgent than approaching a symmetrical corner (like a 3-3 or 4-4)

Also, this move is generally used in handicap games, because it's light and flexible.  If you would like to approach a 4-4 I'd recommend C or D in this board position.]
(;W[id]LB[jc:A][pf:B]TR[dd]C[This followup move is questionable.  It's too far away to be a pincer, really.  If you want to make a pincer (you would do this if you wanted to use the influence of the marked stone.)  Then it's joseki to play at A.  Else standard response is at B.]
(;B[fd]LB[fd:A][md:B]C[This move creates two problems for black.  Both of these stones will probably become weak groups, and can be chased or killed by white.]
(;W[pj]C[It would be good for white to push blacks stones around.  I would start by strengthening your center group.]
(;B[cj]C[For black, I would work on strengthening your top groups.  This is a bit tricky though.  Because when you strengthen one group you also strengthen an opponent.  I would probably start with the top right group because it has more development potential.]

Michael: This was a very fun game to review.  There were a lot of really deep variations.  I wish you would have told me a little bit more about what you wanted out of this review.  If it's lacking in anyway please let me know.  I'll be more than happy to correct it.  And if you have any questions as well, please let me know, don't be shy.

Also, did white resign at this point?  By my count white is winning by quite a bit!]
