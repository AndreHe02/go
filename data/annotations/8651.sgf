C[flyte [10k\]: Hello
bcd [10k\]: hi, gg

Muammer: Hi! It is always better to have the lost games analysed but since you have a special purpose (To see why he resigned and said you played well)  let's see try to understand what happened :) 

Also I will build alternative paths if I see better solutions in your moves.]

Muammer: Assume upper right is dead (with or without ko), it balances most of the profit that white made in lower right. 
The triangled stones at lower left are extremely weak. If black makes a move around D3 or G7 he will take the lead. Because whites J16 stone allows black reduce upper left area, onces black makes a sealed area on right side he would win. In other words, game is really in development stage and I also cannot see why he had resigned.]
