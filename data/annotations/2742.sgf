C[Hi, first of all thank you for reviewing my game. This is the first time i submit a game to the Go Teaching Ladder, by the way.
I play black (ZeroTalent).

*I lost this game, but i feel i had may chances to come back in many different moments during the game. I'd like to know what happened, and why none of my tries was successful.
*I chose to send this game in particular, not because I did well on it, but because I thought i was doing well for moments, and the results troughout the game where terrible for me. I really didn't know how to stop white.

*As the Go Teaching Ladder advices, I commented some of my key moves, so you may find it easily to understand my line of thought.

[lf\] Hello, I will review this game. I'll post my comments with [lf\] in front. This was a very interesting game with lots of opportunities for both sides. - Lefrog]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]
(;B[cn]LB[oc:C][qd:B][pq:A]TR[cj]C[I find it hard to play against a san-ren-sei (is that that spelling), or the 4-4, 4-10, 4-4 formation. That's why thought of attacking from c6 and not f3 for example, for in case my opponent would go d-10, then i could easily kills points there.
This is something i really want to be advised on; what would be the best move for black to avoid the san-ren-sei? Is my move good or just terrible? :c)


[lf\] this is a possible move, though not one I would prefer. The thing is that with 2 komukus, A and B, I would be very inclined to close a corner first, at C, so that usually the oponent would prevent from doing a double corner enclosure, and then would have time to play against the san ren sei (see variation). In the opening, one has to play urgent moves first, then big moves. Here, I think making a shimari is very big (and making a shimari is as big as preventing one). This said, if your goal is to prevent the san ren sei,I prefer c10.]

(;W[od]
(;B[pe]LB[pf:A]C[[lf\] I am not familiar with this move. I don't even think it's appropriate. I think you might have mistaken it with the joseki (family) shown in the variation, as a response to the low approach.If you wish to emphasise the right hand side; you can play A (see variation for a basic joseki).]
;W[kd];B[md]C[I think i got too agressive here, right? I maybe should've followed the joseki and play around q-12.
[lf\] q12 seems too close to me. A proper extension would go all the way to R9.]
;W[oe]C[[lf\] see var for how I think black shouyld use his stone at N16]

(;B[pg]TR[md]C[[lf\] I think this move doesn't take into account the strength of your 2 stones. The sequence that was played doesn't take advantage of the marked stone. Your 2 stones are in no danger, so you can put your marked stone to work now. But this is difficult, I cannot predict what happens. I might try to do as in the variation]
;W[me]C[[lf\] on the other hand having white play this is good, you should tak sente to play elsewhere]

(;B[oc]C[I decided to give up on my n16 stone, and use it as aji.

[lf\] if I may say, aji is better served cold, if you think this stone is aji, then you might leave it until you know or see how to use it. Here, you solidify the position, and sort of kill the aji of this stone. (It could have been used differently) keeping aji for later is a good thing to consider.]
;W[nc]
(;B[ob]C[[lf\] I usually would pull bak at Q17];W[nb];B[nf]
;W[ne]
(;B[of];W[pc]C[[lf\] the problem here is due to the bad shape that the marked move created, this move would have been better at Q17 (as in the variation). If black had wanted to prevent it by playing Q17 now, then P18 really looks like a wasted stone.]
;B[fp]C[Terrible for black this far... so i decided to cool off and make new history somewhere else.

[lf\]this is very good. He didn't answer your approach move, so a pincer is a good idea. Making a shimari at Q5 is not so important as black has gained thickness a the top so if white approaches at Q5 or R5, black will pincer (pincer + extension from the top thickness), see variation]

(;W[dn]C[This absolutely took me out of base. I had never seen this answer before, so I was expecting either e5 or somewhere else., but not there.
What should i have done?

[lf\] this is a typical answer; the start of some classical joseki. You started well in answering.]
;B[dm]C[I decided to stop the advance.

[lf\] this is the correct answer.];W[en]TR[fp]C[[lf\] you have to notice that here, the marked stone sits on the white stones vital point.You must take advantage of this]

(;B[bn]C[.. and now make a move so my opponent would defend the corner, and then I could extend.


[lf\] this is the move that is not so good as it allows white to play C5.. C5 makes good shape, so preventing it is very important here. See variation. But your idea is the good one !]
;W[co];B[cf]C[[lf\] I think this extension is too far from the black stones (they look weak)]
;W[ch];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de]
(;B[dg];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[bg];W[bd];B[af];W[bc]C[[lf\] this was well played of black I think. Now black has strength (thiclness) at the top, and this helps the weak stones at the bottom]
;B[cb]C[[lf\] this move is not necessary as the stones are captured. it is best saved as ko threat, for example]
;W[bb];B[ei];W[ff];B[fl]C[[lf\] these moves are good, they definetlyy strengthen black on the left side]
;W[gn]C[[lf\] this is expected and black should use the chance of playing at the bottom]

(;B[fo]C[the foolest move ever, right? i made it and i inmediately thought my opponent would never answer, and simply invade the middle bottom.

[lf\] not foolest move. I would try to make territory at the bottom. white in this direction gains nothing (dame points) while black makes territory on both sides]
;W[fn]C[luckily for me (or no?) he didn't want to be cut.

[lf\] I think it was lucky for you, but not being cut is important too.]
;B[ip]C[so i protected for the invasion, while trying to make a territory similar to white's upper one, either on that side or the other.]
;W[po];B[np]C[so, i went for taking the bottom for me];W[pl]

(;B[qj]C[ [lf\] I think this is from the wrong direction. Usually, white plays at R3. If he doesn't, you can take the corner.]
;W[kp]C[invasion!! can't he just leave me in peace??

[lf\] I think this is too aggressive.];B[kq]C[i want to defend]
;W[lq]
(;B[lp]LB[jq:A]TR[qp]C[[lf\] if you want to defend, you might consider playing A instead. Remember that black has the marked move, so the corner stones are strong]
;W[jq];B[kr];W[jp]LB[eq:A][iq:B][dr:C]TR[qp]C[now i got cut, with my left stones in danger... but if i do something to protect them, white would go m2 and do some severe damage down there. What to choose?

[lf\] as I said earlier the crosscut is not my preferred option.black might consider sacrifice to save both sides ( you still have the marked move). For the left side, you have forcing moves at A, B and C, maybe this can help to live...]
;B[mq]C[i chose my corner];W[jr];B[lr];W[io]C[question: do my stones have any path to life?

[lf\] their future looks grim to me.but now you must attack the stones on the right ;)]
;B[ir]C[i added one extra stone to try to make 2 eyes (if white didn't k1, then i connect]
;W[js];B[hq];W[eq]C[[lf\] and white takes all possible base away (that would have been a good forcing move for black)]
;B[fr];W[fq];B[gq];W[er];B[gr];W[hs];B[ho];W[hn];B[jo];W[in]
;B[ko]C[i smiled there, i had chances now

[lf\] yes, you did very well indeed.];W[lo];B[ln]C[[lf\] until here, you played brillantly.]
;W[mo]C[now i see my mistake: the obvious next move is L6, right?
[lf\] Yes, with L6 you capture the white stones];B[mn]C[well no, ambition was too much...
[lf\] still, you did play a very nice sequence];W[kn];B[no]
;W[jn];B[nn];W[bo];B[cl]TR[fl][dm][bn][cn]C[[lf\] very good answer. IT makes perfect shape with the marked stones]
;W[go]
(;B[nk]C[[lf\] I would take the white base away at R4];W[rp]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq];W[ro];B[ql]C[I need more territory, so i decided to push white the most i could, and kill it eventualy if i could. (i'm strong there, i should be able too)]
;W[qm];B[rl];W[ol]
(;B[ml]C[[lf\] Here I think Q9 is important.];W[pj];B[on];W[pn]
;B[om];W[pm];B[oi];W[pi];B[qh];W[oh];B[ph];W[oj];B[ni];W[nj]
;B[mj];W[qi];B[si]C[as my s7 group was being left over, i tried the monkey jump to connect]
;W[qk];B[rj];W[ri];B[rk];W[sh];B[rm];W[rn]C[ZeroTalent [15k?\]: i am totally lost here...
Mortimer [11k\]: :)];B[rh];W[sj];B[sk];W[si];B[gg]C[i had probably lost the game already, but i thought i still could use all of my influence and make a last intent of making points in the center, as an expansion of my left territory

[lf\] this is a good moment to consider your attack on the white stones at the right. IT was an all or die. Which means that as you failed to kill them, you got nothing in exchange. This is very unfair, no ? White starts weak and ends up better than you. Attackign while keeping in mind that you're not going to kill him but to benefit from your attack will change your approach to the game, and make it much more interesting, I think (that's what I felt ;)]
;W[gf];B[jf];W[mf];B[lg]C[a careless mistake];W[nh];B[mi]C[[lf you could have sacrificed these 2 stones, they're not important.]
;W[mg]
(;B[ie]C[[lf\] I think this is the mistake. Playing R17 now is very important.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[rf];B[qb];W[pb];B[pd];W[oa];B[re];W[qf];B[qa]
;W[sd];B[se];W[sb]C[at this point, i wondered if t16 would have made a small live group in the corner, while white would cut at q14 and eat more of my stones. Then i saw this would work, so i went for a mistake from white.

[lf\] you did very well, you are good at fighting.];B[rb];W[sc]
C[i'm sure that was what decided the end of the fight];B[sf]
;W[pf];B[og]
(;W[qe]C[[lf\] this is damezumari and bad for white, white should play S13]

;B[ke];W[le];B[je];W[cj]C[i was satistfied now; if i killed all stones in there, i could have another chance, now that white big territory had been reduced to nothing.

[lf\] I suggest you should count in order to make sure there's hope :)]

;B[qr];W[rs];B[sr];W[sp]C[and then, after realising i was dead there too, i lost by time.

I'd like you to tell me, if you are so kind:

*What where my biggest strategic mistakes
*What where my strong points (if any)
*Any recommendation to improve? Like more tsumego, tesuji, etc.

Thank you!


[lf\] I think you are pretty good at fighting and reading sequences. However, you tend to embark on killing too fast in the sense that if you fail the kill, you end up with a bad position. This cannot be tolerated, and it's better to have your oponent live small and give you territory and/or influence than having him live and give you nothing in exchange. I would also start thinking about a principle that is : attack from your weak stones (for example when you consider what happened at the bottom, where you could have saved both groups). So you need to capitalize on your good fighting skills by having the fight go the way that benefits you. Even if that means not killing your oponent. As a practise, I'd recommend that you look at your games wondering what is the meaning of your moves (attack, defense, profit) and check that you are attacking from the better direction (that is form your weak stones, which in turn might bring you profit). 

don't hesitate to contact me if anything is not clear enough. Best regards :)]

(;B[qp];W[qo];B[rl]C[[lf\] attacking like this the white stones must run out towards the triangled path, and chasing them black will make territory as for example in this variation. You might even kill the stones, but when you start to try to kill something, you'd better not fail as usually failling means a big loss. It's better to contain the attack so as to gain something while attacking, see afterwards.]
;W[ok];B[mk];W[pi];B[qi];W[ni];B[lg];W[nk];B[kk]C[[lf\] as long as white tries to save this group, black gets benefit and might end up entering white's sphere of influence. or expanding his left hand side territory. Attacking not to kill but to benefit is very interesting.]
