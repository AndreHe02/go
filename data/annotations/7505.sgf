C[Reviewed by DonPimpon.

I can see your style is prone to ignore the opponent's moves (tenuki). This is a very powerful technique that distinguishes weak players from strong ones. Nevertheless, abusing it can be very dangerous and counter-productive.

In general I cannot see any huge mistake, and you played a close game with a rival 4 stones stronger than you, that's impressive on its own.

My advice is that you should always have a plan, a master plan. 

While reviewing your game I can see that you often change your objectives, so you take some decisions and then you change your mind and make amends.

I would strongly recommend you that you try sticking to your decision even if you discover that it was a strategic mistake. This can sound like a crazy advice, but it helps in the medium and long term. I know about this because my playing style is VERY similar to yours and I got stuck and the only way for me to improve was to make decisions and stick to them, and that meant me losing many games, but building my character and taking responsibility for my actions.

Let's see some examples from your game.];B[dc];W[pq];B[cp];W[pc]

It is better to make your stones work together and play at A.]
;W[qm];B[nq]C[Now you played at A (the spot I recommended you).

The difference, as you can see, is that you are now in gote, and before you were in sente.
Another difference is that now you have 2 groups to take care of instead of 1.]

To me, it seems that you want to invade and live, but you change your strategy to just reduce.]

The white stone is NOT captured in a ladder.
Playing at A would have solved the whole problem and black would definitely win after this, as his only weak group would be safely connected with the bottom one and had massive power in the centre.]

(;B[hf]C[It wasn´t necessary. Here you lost the game for sure.

The rest is yose very well done from both of you.

You played extraordinarily well for a 10k. That rank does not reflect your strength at all.
You will improve fast, but please bear in mind my advice at the beginning of the review.

Good luck!
