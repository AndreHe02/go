 hillel1 13k : 176 hi

(DrK: Dear Reginald, I will be your reviewer for this game. I note in your instructions that I am to focus mainly on Black's play.

Before I begin, I note that to this day, I find this page helpful in relation to how to evaluate a move in any given game: http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrategyForBeginners4Questions

Please read this before you begin and have it in mind when you look at your moves.

I usually try to find 2-3 things specific that I think you can work on, as well as making pointers to things I think you should pay attention to.

All comments are in brackets.

If I miss something or if you have any questions in relation to this review, please email drk.derek@gmail.com.

Cheers

(;B[nd]C[I'm not sure about this move... My plan was to develop the right side, which I did... but perhaps I should approach more corners rather than giving sente to White to gain more ground?




(DrK: I have no issue with this move. I have seen stronger players (dan level) play it.

Generally, when one play two stones in a corner both on the 4th line, the aim is to reach to centre/influence. Without good reason you should not be too concerned if the opponent attack your corner if you can build up a thick wall in return.

I will mention later that because of it, I would question if move 23 works well with this move.)]

1. build moyo;
2. reduce opponent's moyo.

[on][oo][op][qo][qp][bs][cs]C[I believe my main mistake was allowing White to gain HUGE Central Wall... In retrospect, I believe I could have either reduced more or continued to build up my own large Moyo



(DrK: I would suggest that whenever you play a move try to have at least 2 purposes.

1. If you build moyo try to also reduce opponent's moyo.
2. If you try to make a group of stones live try to also attack opponent at the same time.
3. If you try to have a group run toward the centre try also to run while attacking a group.

http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrategyForBeginners4Questions

is still helpful to me in evaluating my own moves and see if any of them do not have sufficient purpose.

In relation to that huge wall you referred to, well it is a question of scoring. If you are not behind gotta reduce. If you are behind you have to take the riskier course and invade. It is scary but to continue in go, one cannot be afraid of 
1. being invaded; 
2. invade; 
3; pincer; 
4. tenuki when you believe that your group is living even if it looks dangerous. Gotta read carefully and then play your move. And most importantly, can't be afraid to 
5. lose, especially embarrassingly.

I would like to further suggest that you work on 3 things:

1. Tsumego - especially in relation to attack and defence. Lots of examples in sensei library website.
2. Study pincer - find out when pincer is effective and when not. Study how to counter-pincer. White's pincer moves were not ideal but if you don't know how to punish it then it is not a bad move.
3. Attack more. I think you were a bit too timid in the following moves (not an exhaustive list: move no. 15, 17, 23, 101).

Hope you enjoyed the review!

Cheers
