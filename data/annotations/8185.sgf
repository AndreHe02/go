C[Brakeshoe- Hi, thanks for reviewing my game.

I do not know my opponent's name but he punished all my mistakes, therefore it is hard for me to see what exactly was a mistake and what not. Your eyes should be better than mine ;)

I have put some small questions , you can answer then by yes or no.

Thanks!

Gus: Hi!. Interesting game, and an excellent one to choose for review. Many mistakes here are typical of kgs players around your level. The summary is that you did very well in the opening, but then got jealous of  your opponent's **potential** territory. Because of this you created multiple weak groups and lost your advantage. You need to work on your middle game. The purpose of the middle game is to end with strong groups in sente so that you can start the endgame first. The middle game is all about who is weak and who is strong. All about cutting and connecting. If your opponent has weak groups and you do not, you should try hard to keep it that way. Once everyone has weak groups the game is very very complicated and anyone could win or loose. When you are ahead, don't play stones that can get cut off unless you plan to sacrifice, or you know exactly how you will get profit from it. Towads the end of the game many things keep dying and it's because black has solid shapes to attack with, and you attack despite your weaknesses. You cannot attack from (or anywhere near) a weak group. At the 1-2k level of play where I am on KGS right now the game was nearly over for black by move 16. By move 41 the game had become good for black. Study that section of the game carefully. I have typed the names of the mistakes you made in all caps. I would say that both players are better at handling strong positions than weak ones.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]C[Brakeshoe- Hoshi better?

Gus:Either is fine. Many pro games eithger way. Hoshi is a more influence oriented style, this is more territorial.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg]
(;W[fc]C[Brakeshoe- 2 spaces?

Gus:Absolutely not. This is Joseki white is strong, and black is not strong yet. This means black should fix his shape and white gets sente.]
(;B[hc]C[Brakeshoe- I believe this is a punishment

Gus:This move? punishment for what? Black's move is terrible. In the opening one usually wants to avoid playing near strength (yours or your opponent). The f17 group is the strongest thing on the entire board and black has put his stone right next to it. This is like playing half a stone, since one side of the stone is erased by the strength of white's position.]
;W[cj]C[Brakeshoe- Should have played c9 instead, better follow up.

Gus: Actually I like this. You are correctly punishing his failure to complete the joseki. 

White has a 10 point corner, 6.5 komi and something to attack.

Black now has a weak group and has not yet made any territory.  Black has only a small lead in influence.]
;B[cm]C[Gus: Black tries to make a mess because he's loosing badly already. Good for him.]
;W[ch]TR[de][cf][dg]SQ[cm]C[Gus: Nice move. you get stronger, and black's shape is ruined. This works well because your corner is rock solid and black will never be able to kill it. a few points is nothing in the opening, but he has zero eyes. When looking at the board a weak group with one eye should be viewed as -10 points. one with zero eyes -20 points. black has zero eyes. your 2 stones can almost be thought of as having 1 eye. Also as your group gets stronger BOTH the triangles and the square get weaker this move is all profit for you and all hurt for black]
;B[bf]C[Gus:B has to play this or you connect make territory and leave him floating, but it gives you a chance to get out]
;W[co]TR[de][bf][cf][dg]SQ[ch][cj]C[Gus: I like this move too. You are helping the weakest stone on the board. The stragegy you have embarked upon is one where the marked groups will run together and in the process black's isolated stone should die a lonely death. Status after 8 moves each: White leads by about 13.5 points. (see below for count)

White -
5 points upper left
12 points lower left
6.5 points komi
-20 points for 0 eye group. 
Total: 3.5 points

Black -
0 points territory
-20 points for 0 eye group.
perhaps 10 points of influence
Total: -10];B[em]C[Gus: painful, but black can't let it die so now you have one weak group between 2 weak groups. This is a very good position, because all you have to do is strengthen your group and you hurt both black groups at the same time. every move in between is worth 2 of blacks moves]
(;W[ej]TR[di]C[Gus: Good direction, bad shape. This leaves a bit of a weakness at the marked point.]
;B[lc]C[This move is not good It offers you the opportunity to start a fight near black's weak group... I]
(;W[nq]C[Gus:This is the first time you've played in the wrong area.. The whole question of the game is how will the weak groups live. Also note that black can almost catch up entirely in territory with one move at k16]
(;B[np]LB[pj:A]C[this is bad by black, it makes you strong. If black had a stone aroud A this would be ok.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[jq];B[gq]C[When you see a move like this, you should say GREAT! a 3rd weak group :)]
;W[eq];B[go]
(;W[jo]C[Gus: SLOW ==> this group is already strong. You played the short extension so you don't need this move.]
;B[mo]
(;W[qj]C[Gus: BIG BEFORE URGENT ==> Black can destroy your group. If he attacks n4 your group will die or live small in gote. You are panicking because you think black can make lots of territory in this area, but he can't. His groups on the left are still in trouble. If he lets you kill one, that plus your reductions will be enough to win the game.]
(;B[qh];W[qm]C[this is ok];B[qo]
(;W[qf]C[FIGHTING NEAR A WEAK GROUP ==>terrible. black is strong on this side of the board any fighting here will help him. where your opponent is strong you must look to settle quickly]
;B[qd]
(;W[of]C[MAKING 2 WEAK GROUPS ==>Now you have 2 weak groups on this side of the board. it will be impossilbe for you to fight strongly on the other side now. and black can still destroy n4 This and r10 are probably your loosing moves]
;B[pi]
(;W[pj]C[SLOW ==> you need to make fast light shapes when you are under attack.]
;B[ni]C[Gus: now it's clear that you have trouble.];W[om]C[Brakeshoe- N14 better?

Gus: there are no good moves here, but p14 is the weaker group, and loosing either group is almost the game now, so yes n14 better]
