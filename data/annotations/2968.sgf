C[My main question about this game is how I could have done better in the midgame.  I play completely in the wrong direction and while I see how I could have done better, I would appreciate the perspective of a stronger player on the best line to have taken.   I am aware the endgame was nothing to write home about either.

(;W[np]C[I like to play the chinese opening myself sometimes but I rarely play white against it.  This approach is obviously incorrect - Q5 would be better?

*O17 is a classical approach, and according to me in this case is the best, altrough it doesn't work well with your 3-3 in the upper left corner.
I don't like exthernal approach to 3-4 and maybe Q5 is better (not R5)]
;B[oo];W[no];B[on];W[jp];B[gq]C[*Black is too greedy and doesn't want u to gain many points, but a invasion like this is bad in fuseki because also if he could live u could gain power, it's better for him an approach around C6. Here you are strong so it's better attack him to gain influence.]
;W[iq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co]C[* maybe this is an overplay, your cutting point at D5 becomes dangerous because of the stone at G3]

(;W[bn]C[I choose the double hane to build a moyo on the bottom side of the board to match against the moyo he will likely build on the right.

* this is not the right choice to build a moyo on the bottom, C6 would be better. with this doule hane u seems to be interested in the corner (see var at move22))]
;B[cn];W[do];B[bm]C[*(see var to gain the corner). this is a classical sequence]

(;W[dn];B[an];W[dm];B[ck]C[*you menaged to build a large moyo too, now a move like n7 seems big for you, but there's something more urgent (Approach in the upper right).
You should also consider that with your huge moyo your opponent could also live inside it or escape because it's open in the upper side.]
;W[nc]C[*Good];B[oe]C[*I don't like this kind of cosmic answer. now R17 would be joseki (see var)]

;B[qh]LB[ed:5][hd:3][ne:1][cf:4][ef:6][of:2][mm:7]TR[ln][lq]
SQ[oh][oi][oj][ok]CR[qm][qp]C[*now it'll be hard invading on the right side. reducing moves are possible, but with a possible loss inside your territory.
maybe there's some aji left around R4.(see var)

Which is the total situation? 
Black has a big side and a corner.
White has no secure territory with the exception of the upper left corner with the 3-3 and the lower corner which  is widely open to invasion and reduction. The upper side seems no man's land, so the more urgent move is an extenion in the upper side. Now a invasion is not necessary because there are much territory left and if you can manage it well the game will be close.
The variation with the invasion looks bad for you because of your weakness around  M3.
With the exchange to 7 the game would be in your favour.]

[jl][ll][fm][nm][mn][nq][mr][or]C[at this point I think I am in with a fair chance of winning.  What is the best direction to proceed from here?

* This is a good moment to estimate the score. If u would be ahead u should try to keep the game simple, in the other case you should invade or try something bigger than territorial moves.

Black:  10 in the lower left corner
+ 10 in the upper side
+ 65 on the right
1 prisoner
= about 85
White: 40 on the left
+45/50 on the bottom
+ 5/10 center
+(no komi) 1 prisoner.
=about 90/95

u seems ahead but your lower moyo is still widely open. so black could steal you a lot of points with a good endgame      (O2 is vey big now for black)]

-the cutting aroud h13 u should have done
-the endgame around H18 and E1
-the 21 points you have on the bottom that could have been about 40. 

The right side is very big for black, but while he was gaining all those points you gained strenght and influence on the other part of the goban, but he was able to reduce you enough to win.
