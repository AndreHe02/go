C[Dear Avi,

You went wrong early in the fuseki, because you mistunderstand the meaning behind the sanrensei fuseki.  You then played heavily, and went into the middlegame with a bad position.  You realised this early on, and proceeded to panic and scramble to try to prevent the opponent from making any more territory, which was the worst thing you could have done.  Because of that, you were constantly occupied with saving your weak groups, and never had time to make any territory of your own.

Hopefully, my comments and ideas will help you to think about the bigger picture and also to understand a bit better how to play the first few dozen moves when you choose a sanrensei fuseki.  This game really was lost in the first 36 moves, so it's during that period that I make the most comments.

I'll precede my comments with *X*: (for "Xopods," my KGS username) to distinguish them from yours.

----

Dear Reviewer,
I am playing Black in this game and I lost by a big margin. I need your advice since this is a typical game of mine recently - I somehow find myself lagging behind and I do not know where I went wrong. Your comments for the whole game are appreciated, but I would ask to focus specifically on my biggest mistakes.
Thanks!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj]C[I like the san-ren-sei fuseki.

*X*: Fair enough.  These first five moves are an exceedingly  common fuseki, so there are plenty of pro examples to study from.  However, san-ren-sei is not an easy fuseki.  If you think the goal is to end up with fourth-line territory on the right side, you're wrong, and likely to lose a lot of games that way.  To play san-ren-sei effectively, you have to try to develop on a large scale.  Instead, as we'll see, you become too obsessed with territory - if you want to play that way, try a more territorial fuseki.]
;W[nc]C[*X*: This seems a little strange to me.  My instinct as W would be to play O3 instead.  D17 is low and D4 is high, so the lower side is a bit bigger than the top.

The D17/O17 relationship isn't bad if White expects Black to extend on the right, since then White could play K16 or L16 for a Kobayashi-style opening.  However, with Q10 there, there's no way Black will  extend on the right.

Although this move is weird, Gobase.org shows it played in 66 pro games.  I'll talk about them more on the next move.]

(;B[lc]LB[de:A][ne:C][jp:B]C[...and I like the pincer version here.

*X*: No.  The pincer is good when the approach is from a an adjacent hoshi corner (e.g. O3 instead of O17).  D17 makes the top side less interesting, so something other than a pincer is in order.

However, you don't want to extend on the right, because you have Q10 there.  Since neither extending nor pincering is good, that leaves contact or tenuki.  D17 is far enough from O17 that contact might not be good (why strengthen the opponent?), so I would say tenuki.

As it turns out, the pros seem to think the same thing.  Obviously, I didn't go through all 66 games, but I clicked on five of them at random.  In four of them, Black tenukied (3 at A, one at B).  Kitani Minoru was the only one of the five that didn't tenuki, and he tried the Takemiya-style move at C.

Remember, you CAN tenuki when the opponent approaches hoshi, especially when you have a stone at Q10.  See the variation for one example of a pro continuation when Black plays tenuki.]
;W[ne]C[This move is not recommended by Ishida, but I saw it many professional games.

*X*: It's seen only when White does not want Black to develop a large-scale moyo on the right side.  You can expect to see this move a lot when you play san-ren-sei.]
;B[pf];W[pb]C[*X*: This is a mistake.];B[qc]TR[pb]C[*X*: You should be happy with the marked exchange.  White has lost potential in the corner, and has not made a base for her stones.]
;W[jc]C[Now the problems start. The following sequence seems natural, but at the end of it I feel lagging behind as Black. What do you think?

*X*: When the opponent pincers you tightly like this, your best bet is usually to induce the opponent to capture you on a small scale.  Notice how flat White is on the top side - take advantage of that.  See the variation for one idea of how you could play.]

(;B[le];W[ng];B[oh]C[I saw Q12 in professional games, but I played this before and did not encounter a problem.

*X*: This leaves bad aji at R10.  If you haven't had problems with this yet, it's because your opponents are too weak to punish it.  The punishment wouldn't come immediately anyway, but a hundred moves down the line.  Just play Q12 and don't chance it - even if you get away with it now, you're developing a bad habit that will be harder to break later on.]
;W[lg]
(;B[kf]C[*X*: This is your first really bad move.  White left a weakness at N14.  Doing this induces him to defend it.  I'd still prefer trying to sacrifice M17 to develop on a larger scale than White, but that has become harder since you added M15.  If you want to move out, K16 is the move.  See variation.]
;W[lf]
(;B[ke]C[Is L16 better?

*X*: K16 better still, although either way, letting White get M14 was bad.]
;W[hd]C[*X*: Now you have a heavy, weak group, and White has good shape on both sides.  This is where the game starts to go badly.]
;B[hf];W[mi]C[*X*: Slow.  White has given you a chance to take sente.]

(;B[ff]C[*X*: Also slow.  See the variations I suggest.];W[fd]
C[At this point, I do not feel so good as Black. First, White has almost secured the top left - which is no less than Blacks top right.. What's more, White's O13 group seems not weaker and even stronger than Black's L15 group. Did I go wrong in the previous sequence?

*X*: The game is not over yet, but you're correct - White is ahead already.]
;B[de]C[This seems to me a bit doubtful.

*X*: It's extremely slow - the White corner is already pretty much secure, so this doesn't threaten anything.  Attacking White in the middle or approaching the lower left are both urgent.]
;W[cj]C[This is a big point that gets Black into a problem - what to play next?

*X*: Might as well exchange C17 for C18, since you played D15.  Helps you settle in the corner later, if need be.  After that?  You have to play aggressively, since you're losing, so I would play N9, and if White answers to defend his group, try to get sente to play K4 and hope your top group can take care of itself.  See the variation for a few ideas off the top of my head.  Note that I haven't read any of it out carefully... I'm just trying to give you some ideas to consider.]

(;B[cn]C[I went for this side.

*X*: No, no, no.  This is greedy Go, and sure to lose the game.  I would say that 99% of the time, it's wrong to  approach from the closed side (that is, the side on wihch the opponent has an extension).

First of all, it does nothing for your own position.  If you approach on the open side, at F3, you're working towards expanding your right side moyo onto the lower side as well (e.g. if White extends at D6, you play K4).

Secondly, an approach at F3 would be fairly strong and hard to attack.  Here, you're playing into a position where there is already a pincer stone in place - it's as if you approached C6 earlier, White pincered with C10 and you played tenuki.  Sometimes, that might be reasonable, but certainly not when you still have a weak group above!  You're just begging White to make a splitting attack.

The worst thing you can do when you're behind is to try to prevent your opponent from getting any  more territory.  First of all, you probably won't succeed (you're more likely to die trying), and second of all, even if you do, you aren't making any territory of your own.  If he was ahead to begin with, and neither of you make any more territory, he'll still be ahead.  The only thing to do when you're behind is to try to develop on a larger scale than your opponent.]
;W[cg]C[*X*: White is winning, so he can afford to play "safety first" moves like this.]

(;B[ed]C[*X*: Bad shape and aji keshi.  After this, you can no longer attach at C17.  Instead, it is you with a weakness, at C15.  Better to attach at C17 and E17  first and then, if he answers in the normal way, run out at K11.  If he then tries to cut at E14, you can dodge into the corner.]
;W[ec];B[fe];W[ge];B[gf];W[en]C[*X*: White is giving you a chance.  He should kick at C5 to make you heavy, then attack.  This way, you can still dodge into the corner.]
;B[dm]C[*X*: Heavy, bad.  C3 is better.  Either way, he gets thickness, but one way you are safe and have territory, the other way you have two weak groups and no territory.  This is only a good move if you can counterattack one side or the other, but here, both of his groups are strong.]
;W[jq]C[*X*: White got the last big point.  36 moves and the game is already over because you panicked when your fuseki didn't go as planned.]
;B[ej]C[*X*: Linking two weak groups is usually a good idea, but here you're just connecting on dame.  As long as C3 is open, protecting C6/D7 is not so urgent.  Instead, you want to reinforce your larger weak group while attacking White's,  I don't know where the best point is, but somewhere around tengen looks good.]
;W[em];B[dk];W[ck];B[cl];W[el];B[dl];W[ce]C[Here White links to the top, and I could not find a way to prevent it.

*X*: This is the price you pay for the bad shape/aji keshi connection you made earlier.]
;B[cd];W[dd];B[cf];W[be];B[df];W[bf];B[dh]C[*X*: Too slow.  White can ignore this, as all it threatens is to capture two stones in gote.]
;W[ch]C[*X*: White makes your bad move into a good one.]
(;B[ip]C[This is a move I originally though is a good one, but I did not like the result afterwards.

*X*: Too close to his thickness.  You're still thinking in terms of preventing him from making territory, when you should be developing your own position.  You need to attack his middle group somehow.  See the variation for one idea.]
;W[jp];B[io];W[jn];B[jo]C[*X*: Never push in unless you're going to cut, since it just takes away your own liberties.  Just jumping to H7 is better.]
;W[ko]
(;B[in]C[*X*: Now that you've pushed in, you should at least cut, as a probe.]
;W[jm];B[im]C[*X*: Pushing from behind is bad.  The ladder is good for you, so a knight's jump to get ahead is better.]
;W[nq];B[lp];W[kp];B[np];W[lq]
(;B[mq]C[*X*: Bad.  Is M4 important?  No, it was kikashi.  Why, then, do you want to save it?  Take the corner with P3, then go save your weak group.]
;W[mr];B[mp];W[nr];B[oq]C[*X*: If you were going to play this, you should have played it right away, in sente.  Why take gote, just to save a useless stone at M4?]
;W[ln]C[*X*: White, too, is obsessed with saving worthless stones.]
;B[fp]C[I attack the weak White stones, but they get to live too easily...

*X*: F3 instead of F4 would make it harder for White to get eyes in the corner.]
;W[co];B[cq]C[This is probably a mistake, since it allows White to connect to the group on the right.

*X*: No it doesn't.  The next move is the mistake.];W[dq]
(;B[bp];W[bo];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq];B[aq]C[*X*: Living in the corner like this just damages your position on the outside.]
;W[hq]C[In my calculation, White is already leading by at least 20 points.

*X*: Yes, you're way behind.];B[il]
(;W[qn]C[...and now comes this invasion... I did not find a way to kill White.

*X*: It's always easier to live than to kill.  However, this is too deep for White, considering he's winning anyway.  He should torment your weak stones a bit more first, then just reduce.]
;B[or]C[*X*: Wrong, because White should ignore it.  The three stones aren't important.]
;W[kr];B[pm]C[*X*: If anything will kill, this should be it.]
;W[qm]
(;B[rp]C[*X*: Submissive.  If you're trying to kill, you must hane.]
;W[pl];B[nm];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[pk]C[*X*: Bad.  It's already hopeless to kill.  Blocking at S11 is big.]
;W[qk];B[ol]C[*X*: Should be S11.];W[ri];B[ql];W[rl];B[qh];W[rh]
;B[rg];W[ro]C[The rest of the game is not interesting - it does not hcange the picture by much.

So, where did I go wrong?

Thanks a lot for your advice!

*X*: Yes, you might as well resign at this point.  I won't comment any further.

If there's just one thing you get out of this review, it should be that you need to stop panicking every time it looks like your opponent might make 20 points of territory somewhere.  It's *sometimes* possible to win a game of Go by trying to prevent the opponent from making any large territories at all, but that's a special strategy, and requires that you take a quick lead in territory, which you can't do with a san-ren-sei fuseki.  

Stop looking at what the opponent is building, and start looking at what you can make yourself.  If you're developing on a large scale, he won't have time to defend all his weaknesses, so you'll still be able to invade later.

Hope I've been of some help.
