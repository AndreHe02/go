C[Hi, this is a game a played recently and i am not sure about my actual rating, i was playing
black and my opponent had a rating of 20k on IGS.
Hope you can determine my rating and help my through the game as i think i made several mistakes, especially when i lost my group and let white live.

Hi,

my name is Rainer (Beholder).
After the first look at this game I think that a rating of about 23-21k should be correct.

I will give you some advice regarding your opening and some of the life and death situations (see my comments marked *B* in the game).

Over all both white and black made very serious mistakes during the whole game. White lost focus after the capture on the right side and tried too hard to get more territory, even so white was leading at that time.

My general advice would be to secure groups before creating another weak group somewhere else on the board.

I hope my comments help you to improve

If you should have questions about the review please contact me at

Best regards
