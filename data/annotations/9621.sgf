AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hello,

My name is Martin (M in the comments). When on KGS, I mostly play under the pseudo "Tictoc". As requested, I will be reviewing the game for Black.

My overall impression of the game is that White was too cautious to win against three stones. In that context, playing cautiously as you did yourself, was a good aproach. But you should know that when you play against a stronger player with handicap stones on your side, you should play aggressively – not brainlessly, aggressively –, so that your adversary will not be able to get the initiative. This might seem counterintuitive, but it's really the way to go. Playing the sheep against a wolf never ends well...

I hope the comments will be useful!

Best,
M];W[nc];B[qf]TR[pf]C[M
When you play with handicap stones in your favour, it's preferable to adopt an aggressive attitude. This R14 is very mild. I would recommend Q14 instead.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[dd];B[ci];W[qb];B[jq];W[qk];B[qi];W[qn]
(;B[nq]C[M
First mistake.
Much too mild. The classic combination will give you a better result (variation).]
;W[rp];B[cf]TR[qq]C[M
Completing the joseki in the lower right seems like a better option, because later you could endanger White's stone. Having possibilities like this is important. And R3 is also very big in terms of points.
Of course, C14 is also big, but there was no hurry to play it. White's upper side is still wide open, and one more white stone would not change that.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[ck];B[bd];W[dh];B[ch];W[df]
(;B[cc]C[M
Mmh... I am getting the impression that you are trying too hard not to play the expected answer. Of course, this is sometimes the best way to go – you have to surprise your opponent and keep the initiative –, but you have to consider the consequences. Here, leaving your position full of holes will make it possible for White to build thickness in sente. This is a very bad thing for Black, because this thickness will be well oriented toward the upper side, which still has lots of possibilities for him.]
;W[ce]C[M
This move by White is already enough to prove that C17 is not very good.]

(;B[di]TR[ck][cn][bp]C[M
If White's lower left position was in a bad situation, this would be playable. But he is quite comfortable, still having the possibility to slide in the lower left corner (B4). Here, you're going too far in letting White play the cuts.]
;W[cg]C[M
Letting your adversary cut a group in two is rarely good. And it is already obvious that White's position is strong. This position in the upper left is your major bungle of the opening.]
;B[bf];W[be];B[bg];W[dc]
(;B[bb];W[dg];B[bj];W[bk];B[ae];W[bp];B[co];W[bo];B[dn];W[dm]
;B[cm];W[bn];B[em]C[L
probably too small

M
It might be right a good call, still. It doesn't feel like a major mistake, because, you're forcing White to defend a small territory while building a stone that will radiate toward the centre (E7).]

(;W[dl];B[lc]TR[en]C[M
Nice as a ladder breaker: White cannot play E6 with ease anymore.
But the problem is that the sequence that White will start in the upper right corner will end in sente for him, so he should be able to squeeze your single stone.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd]TR[qb][jc]C[L
Bad shape, but I don't know how I should have reacted.

M
This is the expected sequence. Nothing bad there on your part. You just have to know that not answering R18 earlier is giving this sente sequence to White. If you made a mistake, it's not in playing the sequence – it's forced throughout –, but in not expecting it.
Now, besides the fact that this is a big point loss and a good base for White, it's bad because White can risk taking sente to squeeze.]
;W[od];B[ic]C[M
Good call. Your right side group is under no immediate threat. You are solidifying your position where White could hurt you and make points.
After 50 moves, White's game doesn't look good. You've managed to keep your advantage.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[ld];B[kb];W[el];B[fm];W[fl];B[gm];W[dq];B[eq]
;W[dr];B[fc]TR[er]C[M
I'm not sure about that one. It turned out OK, sure, but blocking the lower side was pretty big and your upper side group is in no danger.]
;W[db]
(;B[pm]C[M
Better play the classic sequence here: you'll get a better wall as a result (variation).]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[pk]C[M
It's already apparent that the basic variation would have been more efficient. In fact, this is pretty bad for Black if he plays elsewhere...]
;B[gl]TR[pn]C[M
... which he does. Helping your weak right side wall seems more important.]
;W[fr]TR[ll][oo]C[M
A mistake by White (comment on next move).
I would have considered these two options, and kept F2 for later.]
;B[er]TR[kk][ll][on]C[M
From there, White got nervous. He lost patience and tried to break you fast: a loosing attitude. It was a mistake on his part: he did not have a serious change of living inside your moyo, starting with F2. A reduction from the top would have made the game more difficult for you, especially since it would have given him options to make territory in the centre.]
;W[hq];B[ds];W[jp];B[lq]TR[kq]C[M
There's something very reasonable and simple in this answer that is commendable, but I think L3 would be even better.]

(;W[kp];B[kq];W[go]TR[jm]C[M
White should have fled as fast as possible...];B[gr];W[eo];B[do]
;W[fo];B[cq];W[en]
(;B[ok]C[L
mistake I think

M
I agree. It's too far from the action, and it's working on a position that is weak anyway, so White can still take advantage.]
;W[ep];B[cr];W[fq]
(;B[gq];W[gp];B[fs];W[fp]C[M
White is not playing his best game: What's the point of saving these two stones? If all this heavy group dies, his game is over.]

(;B[ln]C[L
another mistake. Also seems kind of slack.

M
I don't know if it's a mistake. It plays well with your weak stones on the right. It helps the four heavy ones on the left. White can't do much to endanger it.]
;W[hr];B[gs];W[hs];B[es];W[dq];B[cp];W[ar];B[br]C[M
Nicely done.];W[bs];B[aq];W[bq];B[as];W[af];B[cs]C[M
Probably the right call. Loosing one of your upper left group will be compensated by killing White's huge lower side whale.
Please note that more solid playing earlier would have left White with lesser ko threats.]
;W[bh];B[ag]TR[fi]C[L
(seems pointless)

M
Indeed. Get out instead?];W[ah];B[bm]C[M
?];W[bl];B[ip];W[io];B[iq];W[hp];B[hn];W[ho]C[M
The ko swap is heavy. White has about 40 points in the upper left, but you have 50 points in the lower left and much better potential for the rest of the game. You're still ahead.]

Calm, good move. The game is over after you won this minor scuffle in the centre. If you play, solid, defensive style, that is :)]
;W[gk];B[rj]C[M
Another very good call. White's last two play did not deserve an answer, and this S10 has lots of consequences: points and a good base for Black, plus a serious attack on White.]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[mn];B[lm];W[mo];B[lk];W[lo];B[oo]TR[pn]C[M

C[L
from around this point on I start playing like a 20k, so bear with me (my endgame has always been weak, and I am also in time trouble).

M
Ah, ah, ah! I'm commenting as I go, and this is a bit shocking, since the game is as good as won for Black.

Remember this simple truth: when you are way ahead, keep thing simple.]

(;B[cd];W[af]

Ok, letting White have his way in both right side corner is bad, but living in the upper left does compensate. If he had killed you, the game would be close.]

(;W[lg]TR[gb]C[M
White's heart is not in it anymore. He should be trying to kill you on the upper side. Not easy, maybe not even feasible, but it's the only option left.]
;B[me];W[lh];B[ih];W[qh];B[rh];W[jh];B[sf]C[L
blunder

M
Allright, but he's getting less than 10 points in net gain, in this exchange. The problem is that he's keeping sente.]
