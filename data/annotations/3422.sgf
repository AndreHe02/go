C[Dear Reviewer,
In this game I played Black and lost by Resignation.
White employed a simple tactic of attempting  to destroy any significant territory I tried to build. I probably made many mistakes - could you please highlight at least the main ones?

Thanks!

Hi,
I am Sami Halonen 2 kyu from Finland. If you have questions about review you can contact me at KGS by my nick srjh. In the review I tried to point out most obvious mistakes, hopefully you find the review helpful.]

Also I think way to improve for B should practicing counting the situation.]
