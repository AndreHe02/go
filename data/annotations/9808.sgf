C[Hi,
This game was played on cyberoro. Both of us are 3k there, i was black and lost by resign.
Needless to say i made many mistakes, but what's puzzling me is the opening. It feels something went very wrong with black's fuseki, but i can't quite tell what. By move 41 white seems quite ahead.
Added some guesses as variations, but i'd really appreciate someone else's opinion.
Thanks for any hints.

Hello, Nice to meet you. i will focus mainly on opening as your order]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]C[Normal opening]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[fr]C[F2 is slow];B[gr];W[er]C[I agree  that you should tenuki here. sth like Q10 is good enough]

(;B[hq]TR[jp]C[playing h3 makes K4 become weird, it should be at L4, while w has sente and big corner, the exchange is good for w]
;W[mq]C[i feel b should be able to better punish / profit from this, w's playing in a really cramped space ...

yes, w plays a bad move]
(;B[oq]C[Good, now w has to run with no space];W[mn];B[pn];W[ce]
C[2 white stones are light and hard to attack, black fuseki looks a bit ruined already ...
Maybe should have tried the variation on move 13 ?

I would call it "weak" instead of "light", w gains nothing with that 2 moves, and b has a nice corner]
