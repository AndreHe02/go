;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo];W[jp]TR[fc][cn][qo]C[Question 1: Where is the best invasion point now?
I don't think that an invasion is necessary. f17 is a good move. If you want to play on the left side then c6 looks good.

Question 2: Should I have done something differently in the beginning?
r5 is perhaps not so fast moving but I cannot critisize it.]
;B[cn];W[cl]
(;B[en]C[I think it is better to jump into the corner. These stones will now become a burden.]
;W[fp]
(;B[cj]C[This seems terrible but I'm not sure what else to do.

Yes, you are not strong enough in the area to play this kind of move. There are some standard sequences starting with d9, but I would prefer to have played in the corner]
;W[el];B[bp];W[cq];B[bm];W[bl];B[bq];W[fn];B[cg];W[eo]
(;B[ko]C[This looks dangerous. I think that black must defend the corner]
;W[dn];B[dm]C[Ugh, I realize now this was a horrible move.]
;W[em];B[dl]

(;W[cp]C[This is a bad move. White should have played d2]
(;B[er]C[is d2 better?
I think that a move around f16 is important. e2 and d2 are pretty much the same.]
;W[br]C[This doesn't work. Black can play d2]
(;B[ar]C[It is not necessary to sacrifice e2];W[dr];B[bs];W[ds]

(;B[jn]TR[fd]C[Intending to build moyo on right middle

It is too slow. k6 doesn't threaten anything. A move around f16 looks interesting]
;W[dj];B[ci];W[ce];B[fh];W[eg]C[This is no good. White should do something about the right side instead]
;B[eh];W[dh];B[dg];W[di];B[ef]C[i win the ladder. give up stones on left for hopefully large moyo on top right.

Good!];W[ch]C[This is too small.]
(;B[ed]TR[pf][fg]C[A strange shape, I don't think it is good. You shouldn't touch the d16-stone.
Perhaps it is best to simply capture at f13. q14 also looks interesting]

(;W[bg]C[To small once again. e17 is absolutely necessary]
(;B[cf]C[ugh. horrible.

I agree, pass would have been better ;-) and d17 better still]
;W[bf]
(;B[df]C[Another horrible move ;-)  Better to capture at f13]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[fc];B[gd];W[kp]C[This move is big, but the right side is more important.]
;B[lp];W[lq];B[mp];W[qf]
(;B[pf]C[Big misstake!

r14 was a weak stone. Now it can get help by leaning on black.
Black should have played a pincer instead];W[pg];B[of]
(;W[pj]C[Strange. r15 would have been good enough];B[qe]C[Good!]
;W[rf];B[og];W[ph];B[gc]C[is this better than r8?

r8 is probably sente, so it is hard to tell which is better but g17 is very good]
;W[qm];B[mq]
(;W[kq]C[Too small.]
(;B[re]TR[ni]C[should i have moved in the upper middle somewhere?

I think o11 is the move];W[lc]C[This looks a bit unreasonable, but white is behind so maybe he has no choice]

(;B[le]C[hmmm. maybe o17 instead?

I think that k17 is the move that would be best at removing the base for white]
;W[ic];B[fb];W[eb]
(;B[hb]C[Bad.
Maybe this was the loosing move?
White has no connection so black should block from the other side or seal of the centre area and let white live on the top

Up til here black seem to have a good game going];W[oc];B[pb]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[ob];B[qb];W[nd]
(;B[jb]C[This is a dangerous kind of move. It should only be played if you are certain of killing, or if the alternative is to resign]
;W[jc];B[kb];W[kc]
(;B[mb]TR[lb]C[Black leaves too many cutting points. m18 looks better]
;W[lb];B[md];W[mc];B[nb];W[ma];B[ib];W[na]C[Unnecessary. The black stones were already captured]
;B[ne]C[should have gone k15?];W[je]
(;B[hf]C[j15 instead?

j15 doesn't work,. In fact I think white is alive. l15 might be a litle problem, but i think white can handle it]
