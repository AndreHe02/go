Otherwise, your opponent will enjoy himself setting up a splitting attack, or a driving attack, or a leaning attack.

To the contrary, if you settle quickly, you get more opportunities later because you're freed from the burden of having to care about the group.

So, when floating amidst a big moyo, we should muster our patience and make thick shape before we rush into open areas.]

To decide serenely, you have to make a positional judgement (count the game). A rough estimate will do if you're lazy or don't have much thinking time, but take the habit of pausing between each fight to assess the board. If ahead, you don't need to take risks. If behind, then you have to.

The latter is the case here, so your intuition didn't fail you this time... But in serious play, say a tournament, explicit positional judgement is a required skill. By the way top players are most admired for this, especially Yi ChangHo.]

> Summary.

Up to White's invasion, it's still a game. Then Black played a slack move (Q14) and made a big mistake at D8, but W didn't take advantage.

Instead W rushed to create a second weak group. As a result Black was able to enclose a large center. W tried hard and took the risk of a deep move, but it still was not enough.

When dealing with moyo, one should use positional judgement to decide on the risks to take. When invading, find either the area where the opponent has weaknesses, or more potential, and come in there. When reducing, avoid crossing the sector line so that you have clear escape routes.

You did OK at that. In my judgement what cost you the game was the large advantage Black took from the parallel invasions. 

So, concentrate on the fundamentals:

* urgent before big, e.g. P10 before G17
* avoid parallel weak groups, e.g. P10 before M4])
