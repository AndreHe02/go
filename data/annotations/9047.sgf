C[[Actorios\] Hello, my name is Guillaume and I'm glad to review your game. I take advantage to say that I do like your go blog about "making the push after forty" (http://goshodan.blogspot.ca/). 

Maybe one general comment regarding GTL: don't hesitate to ask a lot of questions or highlight what was your plan in playing such or such a move. It's easier for the reviewer to know what to focus on and it makes the exercise a little bit more interactive. That being said, I'll start and summarize by the end of the file.]

(;B[jo]C[[Actorios\]This move doesn't look right. When facing a contact play, it's important to compare the value of both hane and extension.]
;W[io];B[in];W[ho];B[kn];W[kq];B[lp]LB[jm:A][lo:B]C[[Actorios\] Note those two weaknesses left for peeps from White. This would feel like a rub on your knuckles.]
;W[lq];B[mq];W[mr];B[nq];W[nr]
(;B[or];W[qf]LB[pd:A][fp:B]C[[Actorios\] This is a good move from White : he played away from thickness and it's a move difficult to tenuki from. 

What is really hard is that it feels hard to play against White while Black is weak at both A and B.]

(;B[pl]C[{Actorios\] This move looks at making territory with thickness. It's painful because you would want to extend further away.]
;W[ql];B[qk]C[[Actorios\] This is an interesting hane : you are thick so you may dare moves which you wouldn't in ordinary circumstances.]
;W[pk]
(;B[qm];W[rl];B[rm];W[rk];B[ol];W[fn]C[[Actorios\] Your corner is very big but White got an even bigger slice of the cake.
Your corner stones feel a little bit overconcentrated even if the territory is big.]
;B[mc];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[ic]C[[Actorios\] Good tenuki : this slide on the second line seems small.]
;W[hc]C[[Actorios\] Bad move from White : this induces the iron pillar which builds a perfect extension for Black.]
;B[id];W[gc]
(;B[cl]C[[Actorios\] This is a bit the same as what White just did: this kind of angle play from below is usually not good.]
;W[cm];B[dl]C[[Actorios\] This ends in gote, which is not so good for Black.]
;W[bc]LB[ib:C][rb:D][be:A][nj:B]C[[Actorios\] Some ideas of play here : respond locally with A, play B ( expand Black's moyo while reducing White's, threaten a monkey jump at C, make points in the corner at D). There may be better but that's what I'm thinking off. I think I would play A because it has follow ups and it's a direct response to the threat... Right besides that is an which shows expectations in the center.]
;B[em]C[[Actorios\] This is a bad move : it achieves very little and it's gote.]
;W[en];B[el]LB[el:C][em:A][en:B]C[[Actorios\] There is a principle which is called the ABC principle (which I believe comes from Catalin Taranu, a professional player from Romania) : if you play an ABC sequence with your opponent, it's usually better to avoid the A for B exchange and directly play C.]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[ra]
(;B[ee]LB[bd:A][cl:B]C[[Actorios\] This is not sente. White was kind enough to respond but he really shouldn't.
Like A and B, you are overstretching yourself. Going one line further than normal is counter-productive.]
;W[ed];B[de]LB[ee:B][ef:A][nj:C]C[[Actorios\] Considering the fact that you added a move, I would play A rather than B if you really want to play there. Still C is really the move I'd like to play.
A little bit like on the previous sequence (ABC principle), you are playing a sequence where you try to go too far / too close to the opponent and you're missing the fact that you will lose the initiative after they immediately respond. There's nothing wrong with playing gote as long as as you get enough out of it.]
;W[hm];B[im];W[gm];B[hn];W[gn];B[go]C[[Actorios\] This cut is not realistic : those stones are doomed. By playing this exchange that doesn't work, you are taking away liberties from your stones in the center which may cause them problems later on. It's therefore better not to play the exchange.]
;W[of];B[pg];W[pf];B[ng]C[[Actorios\] This move doesn't look right : it's letting Black separate. I'm curious of the reason which led you to this move.]

(;W[qg]LB[og:A]C[[Actorios\] White should take advantage and play at A.]

(;B[og]C[[Actorios\] I'm thinking connecting is small as well for Black. B seems more versatile. A would also help building in the center.]

[Actorios\] Let's count again: A is 16 points. B is 21 points. C is a massive 53 points. D is 47 points. E is 23 points. F is 15 points . So 90 to 85.

[ss]C[[Yukontodd\] Hi, and thanks for doing this.

My provisional ranking here is off, I'm probably somewhere around 8kyu; my opponent is a fairly regular partner and we're pretty close in strength and his rank isn't provisional.

This seems typical of many of my games lately.  I feel like I`m ahead through the opening, or at least in some control, but about half-way through the middle-game the game stagnates and I get pushed back.  Some pointers about where I`m fighting the wrong fights or how things turn against me (if that`s what`s going on) would be appreciated.

-Todd Bowlby

[Actorios\] Yes, I would have expected more glaring mistakes for a 10k so I understand you are above this level.

If I try to sum it up: 
- be careful about automatic moves : hane in response to contact play is the good answer in 80% of the time but it's worth considering extensions as well.
- try to be aggressive with thickness and not to build from it. I learnt a lot about that from practicing san ren sei and looking at Takemiya games. Maybe you should try it and get your game reviewed by stronger players.
- be careful about some moves you play : they are not good from a shape standpoint like those "reverse shoulder hit". You need a very good reason to play those.
- check your endgame. There are very few points in the center unless you enclosed big so usually the biggest endgame moves are on the border. Look for double sente moves as a priority. For me, the game was really more decided in the end than in the middle.

If I think about the elements that helped me grow from 8kyu to my current, I would probably name the following :

1/ Learning to tenuki more - It's important to look for the board for the big moves you want to play : key spots for both you and your opponent, plays which kills multiple birds with 1 stone (multi-function moves : attack / build territory / defend / etc.). Whenever your opponent plays, you have to tell yourself : "is this move really asking for an answer? can I get something better on the board?"

2/ Learning the value of thickness came late to me but if I can't still easily play light, I don't feel frustrated anymore by not getting the territory. I'm fully conscious that the strength is worth just as much. Sometimes, it's tricky to use but you have to keep in mind that if a fight happens you'll be at an advantage. That was a mind opener for me to understand that fighting is all about being in the right conditions to do so. I learnt to enjoy inviting the opponent to come fight on my ground.

3/ Take care of your weaknesses. If you have the burden of weak groups, your attacks will fail. In a way, in your game, White had a head start because you had too much to care about with weak stones. It's important to deal with the relative safety of groups first. Jumping into the center is the usual habit for that. I remember the time where I felt bad about being pincered. It's getting better now.

Maybe those pieces of advice could be valuable to you.

That's about it. I hope this review did answer some of the question you were asking yourself. I'm not always 100% confident about my statement but I tried to point out when it was more a feeling than an absolute conviciton. We are really all learners on the path of go. 

Please feel free to ask me if you have any further questions.

Cheers,

Guillaume])

(;B[qj]C[[Actorios\] I think this is a better continuation in the spirit of what you played: the last thing you want from a wall is to get overconcentrated. The marked stone is weak so White is at a disadvantage in this fight. Remember that thickness should not be used for territory.

To be honest this is not the typical move I dare to play but my teacher did emphasize such line of thought in my last games so I'm sharing the tip. Here the situation is difficult because if I believe those stones will live, the upper right corner may suffer in the process.]
