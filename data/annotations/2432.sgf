RE[W+Resign]

C[Just a general review of what could have been done better, esp of the opening / middlegame to put me in a better position for the subsequent fights.

LB[ie:C][kg:A][pf:B]C[Comment: I think you should probably continue with the top. A, B or C would be interesting. A just escapes into the middle which is always useful. B places pressure on the side first and would then aim to play at A to attach the two stones. C puts a lot of pressure on the white group]
;W[gd];B[eo]C[Comment: Again play at the top.];W[if];B[qk]C[I think this creates a heavy group. Thus you strengthen white and make life a little difficult for yourself. L13 is maybe better but this group is more difficutl after whites move.]

Summary: Not too bad a game for you particularly given the difference in strengths. I think that you played away from your weak group at the top and instead started another. The second group worked well although you missed two opportunities. Fristly when you tried to capture three stones too closly and then when you didn't connect at J4. You still an the opportunity to rescue the stones at the top but you chose to try and solidify your territory in the middle and gave up too much on the top. N.B. Try to look after your weak groups. These often can be done by putting pressure on your opponent in sente. Best wishes.]
