C[G: Hello,
This is a game I played in tournament as black, but please review for both sides, it's always interesting. The fight started early, so I think it would be a good idea to focus on the fighting aspect of the game. It stops at move 121 because I am unsure after that.
I did not make too many comments/question, please comment freely at whatever you feel will be interesting.
Thanks for your time.

JS: My name is Juergen Suntinger, I come from Vienna, Austria and I am currently about 2 dan in strength. Hopefully we both can learn somthing from this game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[ci];B[jd]C[JS: Interesting, I think that Black already has a little advantage here because he got the vital point of the low Chinese Opening of White at the top which is also a vital point for Black's Sanrensei.]
;W[nq];B[de]LB[jp:A]C[JS: Generally speaking one should not start some small scale fighting when there are still big poings left on the board. Open space is what is called for. There is so much open space on the lower side around A, so why should it be good to start an unvafourable battle at the top left. 
I just think bottom is more important now. After the bigger fights at the bottom become settled somehow you can judge better what to do at the top left.]

(;B[dg]LB[cc:a]C[G: I wanted to solidify my group because of the C11 white stone, but this move ends up in a poor result for black because of the peep; should I have played at A?

JS: Yes I think A would have been better. But remember, you cannot hope for a good result in this corner because you were already pincered. That is one aspect of the Chinese opening. It lets the opponent a hole to come in, but if he does, he gets attacked heavily.]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[cc]LB[ci:A]SQ[dd][de][ef][cg][dg]C[JS: after this it is hard to find a good continuation for Black because the upper White group is totally secure.
However, what I always think of how to explain something in reviews is the following: There is always someone who is attacking, lets call him the hunter, and someone who is defending, lets call him the prey. But sometimes the hunter becomes the one hunted! So if you want to become hunter or prey is up to you :-).
Lets look at the actual situation: The marked Black stones maybe not that strong, but are they really weaker than the White stone at A? Look at the variation.]

(;B[ce]TR[dd][de]C[JS: This move just says: "Please, don't kill me, just give me 2 eyes!"; unfortunately this move also makes bad shape. You know the empty triangle is something one only plays when there is absolutely no other way.]
;W[ei]LB[bf:A]TR[cf]C[G: this hurts

JS: Yes, what is even more emberassing is, that the marked White stone can still escape at A, connecting either up or down]
;B[gg];W[ff];B[fg];W[eh];B[eg];W[jp]C[JS: Good point for White, Black should have taken this just bofore beginning the fight in the top left.]
;B[gi]C[JS: This is also very good point for Black expanding his own moyo and reducing the opponent's, with the invasion in the lower left is still possible.]
;W[gj];B[fi];W[fj]
(;B[ej]C[JS: This cut seems a little bit unreasonable because it maybe only ending in Black having a weak group to look at. Look at the variation.]
;W[dj];B[ek];W[dl];B[el];W[gl];B[dm];W[cl];B[fm];W[cm];B[dn]
;W[bo]C[G: I feel like white has let me in peace, here

JS: White played good here, keeping distance from the group she wants to attack. 
Remember, killing a group is not the same as attacking it. After White settles her groups on the left, the Black and White group in the center started to run into the Black moyo. This is not really what Black wanted to do.]

(;W[jl]LB[kk:A]C[JS: This White move is too heavy and leaves the Black peep at A. Look at the variation.]
;B[lm]C[JS: Good move from Black.];W[io];B[in];W[gm];B[gn];W[eo]
;B[fn];W[jf];B[kg];W[jg];B[kk];W[jk]C[JS: The White group becomes heavier and heavier while Black gets more and more stones surrounding the whole right side.]
;B[gp];W[kq];B[np]C[JS: Good move from Black.];W[oq];B[op];W[pq]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[mq];W[mr]
(;B[rq]LB[qp:A]C[G: is hane better?

JS: In this position Black maybe will get a little bit bad aji because White become the possibility of peeping at the cut A. Therefore Black can also play hane, see variation.]
;W[lq];B[pg];W[kd];B[cn]LB[dr:A]C[G: the sequence ended bad for black, but there must be something to do in this corner...

JS: In the corner the submarine move at A looks interesting, but at the overall position it is much bigger to secure the top right corner first.]

;W[hg];B[fd];W[hf]LB[gb:A]C[JS: Securing this 4 white stones is just a small endgame move because after Black captures White can capture back. Simply connection her stones at A would be better for White.]
;B[pc]LB[gb:a]C[G: should be at A I think, now. It would separate the two white groups, continuing the fight.]
;W[gb]C[G: Now this is really big.];B[lj]LB[mc:a]C[G I also thought about A

JS: Yes, I think A is bigger now.];W[ng]LB[ld:c][lf:a][lg:b]
C[G: I answered submissively to this move. But I don't really know what to do. A, B, C, maybe, but the white center group is now very strong, so I'm reluctant to  play so close to it.]
;B[oh];W[pf];B[qf];W[pe];B[qe];W[og];B[ph]LB[mc:B][nh:A][rr:C]
C[G: could be at A, there is no danger... or maybe I can play elsewhere (B)?
Anyway, this is the last move, since after this is the endgame and I am unsure about the order of moves.
The game was close in the end. White made an endgame mistake, losing 4 stones, and Black won by 2 points.

JS: I think B is still the biggest point on the board because it has good continuations to slide into the white position. The value of a move at C is also very high.

Thank you for reviewing your game and keep playing this game having more attention to look at the whole board :-).]

(;B[rr];W[rq];B[qp];W[pr]C[JS: Now Black can tenuki and leave the situation for the endgame. Now it would be time to start an attack on the White group in the center which is still without any eye.]
))
(;W[kl]C[JS: The keima connection also prevents against the cut, but moves faster into the center.]
))
(;B[hj]LB[fi:A][fj:B]C[JS: This move looks better to me, because it basically serves the idea to enlarge Black's own moyo and reduce White's moyo. Maybe this hane should have been played leaving the A, B exchange in reserve.
Remember, that if White is heavily keeping his left side territory, he maybe end up overconcentrated after Black invades the lower left Hoshi somehow.]
))
(;B[dj]C[JS: So now White is the one beeing attackt. When White crawls several times on the 3rd line to make live, Black gains significant outside influence which should be working good with the Black Sanrensei on the right.]

(;B[cc]
(;W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[cb];W[gc]C[JS: This would be a somehow good result for Black, but White maybe plays more severely.]

(;W[cb];B[bd]LB[bd:A][df:B]C[JS: This also looks playable. Remember the kosumi at A. It makes miai of living in the corner and going out easily and als protects against the cut at B.]
