Hi Colin,

my name is Rainer (Beholder) (5k) and I did the review for your game. All my comments start with B:

Generally you are placing a lot of unnecessary stones, but don't worry this will get better as you play more. Even amateur dans play the occasional wasted move :-) Always ask yourself befor placing a stone "What does this stone really do?".

You asked if there was a chance to save the group on the right side. Of course there was, before move 137.


I hope my comments help you in your future games.

Best regards

(;W[bp]LB[cm:C][ep:B][fp:A]C[B: Wrong direction. Better to play A, B,C or something similar.]
;B[dp];W[cq];B[dj]
(;W[ce]LB[cc:A][fc:C][cd:B]C[B: Not a good point for attack. Either play right into the corner or a contact move if you are jealous of Blacks moyo. Or you play at C and build some moyo yourself.]
;B[cd]C[B: Now White is cut off from the corner without support.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[bf];B[cg];W[bh];B[de];W[cf];B[df];W[ch];B[dh]
;W[bj]LB[ce:A]C[B: The play on A forced White to crawl along the 2nd and 3rd line while Black was able to build a wall. The position favours Black.]
;B[nc]
(;W[jc]LB[lc:A]TR[nc]C[B: Too far away from the marked stone to be an effective pincer. If you want to pincer, better play at A.]
;B[hd]TR[dd][de][df][dh][dj]C[B: Black is too protective and plays too near to her wall.]
;W[hb];B[hc];W[ib];B[gb];W[oq]TR[hb][ib][jc]SQ[pc]C[B: Not good as an approach, see move 10. There are still more important points to play as you have unsettled and weak groups.]
;B[op];W[pq];B[nq]C[B: Black decides for influece and gives up the corner.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[rp];B[ro];W[sp];B[or]C[B: Overplay by Black.]
