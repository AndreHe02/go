Should I play here?
R: w14 is the best move*  according to my computer search, The search results are as follows: I find 17 games by Japanese professional players with  the same pattern, and 10 players (about 10/17=60%) selected w14. The second selection was k4 (6players) and the rest one player selected L4]

R: In this situation, all (4) professional players  move *. and w20 was not find.]

R:I don't know what to do with black's moyo.So I try to cut and reduce the moyo while fighting.
R:  I dont know next move, but I think w22 move is a good one.]

Should I play j7 instead? Or any other?
R:As your comment, you shoud choose j7.  W 32  was aÅ@serious move,  <for a contact play, normal respons is hane ( diagonal movement, j7), although I admit some exception in rare case.   However, in this case w stones are overlapping in the narrow space, althogh upper space is vacant.]

R: w36 move should omitt.];B[kq];W[jm]C[
R: w38 is somewhat heavy move, k8 is better move.];B[im];W[ol]
C[
I think I shouldn't play this move.It gave white a secure big territory.]

R:w74 is the worst move in this game, B19 should be selected.]
;B[cf];W[ee]C[
Should I play B19 instead?
R: As white is thin, therfore, 76 move is much impotant than territory expansion move.]
;B[ca];W[df];B[ce];W[jb]MA[fb][kd]C[
I try to kill.But no way to success.  R: white has weak points,Å@e.g.  * (F18) is conection to left corner and *(L15)  can not cut due to  snap back, so black is living..]

R: Instead of 82,  A should choose, if black B ,then white C]

until now, my time is out.
thanks for giving me a review.
R:  In early stage, your move is very good, If you avoid bad shape, you become much stronger.]
