C[This game was against a GNU Go bot on KGS, which turned into a remarkably tough and close game (for me).  There was a near-swindle at the very end that shifted the score a bit more in White's favor, but I was still behind by five points or so even without that incident.  I felt like I was pushing from behind for most of the game, once White got his framework established on the bottom.

[Looking at your coments, you seem to have a pretty good idea of where you could have played better in the first half of the game - attack white's top right group harder, don't invade in the 3-3 bottom left and try to reduce the moyo on the bottom a little more (& probably earlier). \]

[You didn't need to really destroy the moyo because you had a lot of territory of your own, and you had some chances to take command of the game. As it was the game stayed close, and you were unlucky to lose the game (ingoring the disaster at the end of course).\]

[The other thing i would say is that it seemed like neither of you played the endgame very well - you seem to answer a lot of moves unecessarily, and a lot of moves were worth 0 points. \]]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd]C[[I'm not going to criticise your next move...but...there's one area that's screaming out to me to be played now.\]]

(;B[pj]C[Sanren-Sei.  Have been trying to use this opening as black fairly often, just to get a feel for it.  I'm not very good at utilizing outward influence though yet.

[this is a perfectly decent move all the same of course\]];W[ec]
;B[cj]C[Blocking the extension from the corner enclosure seems like the only move here.

[approaching at f3 or maybe k4 look playable to me also\]];W[nq]

(;B[oq]C[I believe that Q6 or R6 would be more usual responses to this approach, but am not sure what the pros and cons are.

[with the q10 stone on the board you want to attack so q/r6 are both a bit boring. a pincer is probably best.\]

[the move you play allows white to make the perfect shape, so is bad in this case. it's normal to play the contact only when you have a stone at k4 in order to cramp white for space like you do later in the top right\]]
;W[np];B[pn];W[jq]C[[now white has the perfect extension from the two o-stones\]]
;B[jd]C[The last big point for the territorial framework.

[yup - big. c6 or c7 look ok too i think\]];W[qf];B[qe]C[Responding to White's initial invasion of that framework.  Blocking the corner feels appropriate here, due to the stone at Q10.

[goodmove. this time this is strong because the q16-r14-q10 relationship is right.\]]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[hc]C[[wierd move by white. q14-r14 are weak and heavy, so he must defend them. Equally you should attack...\]]
;B[jc]C[Possibly a mistake.  Would R12 have been more appropriate, to stay on the offensive with the unsettled White stones there?

[exactly\]];W[ph];B[qi]C[[nice move\]];W[nh];B[nj]C[[good move\]]
;W[lh]C[[it's hard to see exactly how to continue the attack but i think you have to. the aim in attackig is not to kill (at first :-) but to take territory and make power whilst attacking. i would play m10 although perhaps playing a forcing move at n13 first might be appropriate.\]]

(;B[cq]C[On reflection, I think this was the turning point in the game. Perhaps I should have done a more usual approach at C6 or C7 rather than the direct invasion.  Or extended further toward the corner enclosure with C13.  Regardless, I gave White a whole lot of outer influence which was put to very good use.

[you said it perfectly. if you are concerned about the bottom,approach from outside at c6 or c7. this is too easy for white.

A 'naked' invasion like this is usually considered as giving a better result for white, unless the global situation makes the thickness not very useful. Here it's the opposite - the thickness is more useful due to the whole board position \]]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[cg]C[I'm not sure about this move either.  Should I have tried connecting to the stones in the lower left corner instead?  Or should I have gone ahead with D2 immediately?  I think I was just afraid here that the stone at C10 would be run over.

[hmmm, this is gote so i don't like it. if you played d2-e2-e3, then white would be very brave not to play f3\]]
;W[me];B[md]C[[good timing from white\]];W[qq];B[qp]C[White's second invasion of the framework.  Still trying to block off the territory on the right side.]

(;B[om]C[Now we're starting to see some significant white walls for territory on the bottom.  I was more focused on the right side though still.

[yup right again. who's is bigger white or black's territory on the bottom? easy question really, so it's time to do something about it...\]

[it probably worth stopping to get a feel for the score here first\]]
;W[lm]
(;B[lj]C[[a bit slack methinks...\]];W[fm];B[im]C[I've finally realized just how big the territory is on the bottom that White has been walling off for some time.  Not sure if there was a more appropriate reduction move that I should have played, either now or earlier.

[this looks like the right sort of play now. any deeper and you will get attacked severely\]]

(;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq];B[be];W[bd]
(;B[jh]C[Was thinking here that the white group still wasn't really settled. I also thought about trying S13 as an attack.

[S13 is a good move to take away eyeshape to kill, but the problem is that white will exchange S14&S12 with you and this will leave some massive endgame for white so if you dont kill you lose territory big time. It's better to attack from the outside first. This move is nice\]]
