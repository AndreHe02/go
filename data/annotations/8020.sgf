C[TM—Hello, I'm the reviewer. After having looked through game, I would like to point out two key moments. First, at move 20, you decided to approach the 4-4 corner from within Black's strong space. This is very often a bad idea; it's greedy (you weren't lacking for territory yourself throughout the game) and will only start a conflict that you might prefer to avoid. Then look at the sequence following move 54. It seems that you lost focus here, and decided to push against your opponent's group simply because it was there—but in doing so, you passed up the opportunity to make territory and, more importantly, you strengthened the enemy right beside your weakest group (the group whose fate was decided back in move 20!). Try to be calm. Look at the whole board, and don't be afraid to play defensive moves in gote if it will save you some trouble down the road.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq];W[hq]C[I didn't want black to develop a moyo so I usually pincer at this area.

TM—This is fine. It is also reasonable to answer at C6.];B[dn]
;W[fp];B[cp];W[eq];B[cq];W[ce]LB[op:A][oq:B]C[I thought this was a big move but gote. Looking at the board now, black got about three corners.

TM—Yes, this is big. It seems better to me, though, to extend to A or B from your group on the left.]
;B[oq];W[qj]C[Feels like the only move.];B[jc];W[cl];B[bn];W[hc]
;B[je]
(;W[nc]C[I was thinking R14 but wouldn't that just help black get a lot of points at the top?

TM—This looks dangerous. Black is strong at the top and R10 is isolated, so you are risking creating two weak groups. It is much better to approach on the other side (see variation).]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[qf];W[nf];B[pg];W[oh]C[I thought connecting is necessary. Otherwise, I'll get two weak groups - I was cut anyway.

TM—You can see that you're in for a fight ...]
(;B[og]C[TM—The natural attack. Black can also think about playing Q11.]
;W[ng];B[nh];W[jg]C[TM—This was a good way to get some breathing room. It is a bit far from O13, but the cap forces Black to deal with his own stones.]
;B[hd];W[oi]C[TM—Good timing. Black surely had regrets about having to defend at H16 rather than playing here himself.]
;B[gc]
(;W[qn]LB[oo:A]SQ[gc][mh]C[Is N12 a good move or slow?

TM—N12 will decide whether your two groups are connected or not. For White, it's a solid, patient move. (Compare to Black's solid, patient move at G17.) Since you played elsewhere, it was natural that Black took N12 immediately. Your move here (R6) looks unreasonable: you're making a far extension from a weak group to a strong corner instead of staying connected. If you instead play N12, you could then aim at A, which would be a way of making your top right group work with the bottom left.]
;B[mh];W[lf]C[TM—You manage to escape in the end here, but your opponent could have offered a stronger resistance (see variations).]
(;B[oe];W[ne];B[kh];W[jh];B[kg];W[kf]TR[oi]C[TM—Black didn't dare cut at K14 because of the marked stone, although he might have been able to pull it off ... which would have been catastrophic for White.]
;B[kj];W[jf];B[ji];W[li];B[lh];W[ii];B[jj];W[on];B[hb];W[ij]
;B[jl];W[ik]C[TM—So, you saved your beleaguered group, it seems, and with enough time to play a reinforcing move at P6. In the upcoming sequence, though, look at what's happening on the grand scale. What is your goal? Are you interested in making some territory on the left? (You have built up some influence after all with these six stones from K14 to J9.) What about the bottom side? Or your framework on the right, which is still quite thin? Sure, in the end you get some territory in the centre, but at the expense of losing some on the left side and weakening the right.]
;B[mk];W[jk];B[kk];W[kl];B[ll];W[km];B[lm];W[kn];B[ln];W[ko]
;B[lo];W[lp];B[mp];W[lq];B[mq];W[kr];B[cj]LB[kr:A]C[TM—Nice timing by black. Consider the difference if you had played in this area yourself instead of at A. (A is a good move for later, but there are bigger targets right now. If you're worried about your two stones at M4, you could sacrifice them in sente.) More importantly, though, don't your stones on the right look a bit insecure next to that massive black wall?]
;W[ch];B[bl];W[em];B[dm];W[dl];B[bk];W[en];B[rm]SQ[nh]C[How to deal with black here?

TM—This is the attack that we knew was coming sooner or later. The cut at O12 split your two weak groups. Now, going back to around move 54 (see the comments there), you can see that you had the opportunity to secure your group on the right earlier. Instead of wondering how to deal with Black here, you should travel back in time.]

My comments end here. Thank you!
