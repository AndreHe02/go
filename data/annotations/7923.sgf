C[Hello, dear reviewer!

In this game my opponent played a fuseki that looked quite uncommon, but I had a hard time finding answers that would make me happy. Please comment this and also the middle game fighting.

Thank you!

Hi HonFu,

This game was a crazy game!  If it was on KGS, I am not surprised!  It was interesting to review.
Kyle];B[pd];W[qp];B[cp];W[ep];B[dn];W[cd]C[Hon: Here we already leave the path of the joseki I know. Since he tenukied ...]
;B[hp]C[Hon: ... I pincer, but ...

[kb\]: It's a good pincer.];W[jq];B[fo];W[hr]C[Hon: ... after this move I don't see a continuation. Also my influence seems to point into a direction of minor importance. How should I have played instead?

[kb\]: This move is very slow.  Black's influence here is superior and you have the corner/side.  Black is already ahead.]
;B[ed]C[[kb\]: The right direction.];W[cf]TR[cg]C[[kb\]: It is painful for White to have to play such a slow move!  Perhaps C13 is better for White.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[bb];B[ic];W[qf];B[pi]C[[kb\]: Good.];W[of]
;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[ni]C[Hon: Another of those moves that should be bad in theory. He doesn't take a base but rather forces me from the outside to live in the middle of his stones.

Okay, he got into trouble later, but I am not sure if I handled this right.

[kb\]: Yes, this is an overplay with no White support on the side.  The R4 stone is too far away to do much.]
;B[pg];W[pf];B[qg];W[rg];B[rh];W[rf];B[ql]C[Hon: So I took his base and got one for myself, but he can live easily all the time with S17 and R16, so what did I accomplish? Or where did my thinking go wrong?

[kb\]: ...You took his base and got one for yourself... what are you concerned about again?  White has no territory in this area and little influence, and you got to play on both sides!]
;W[qn]
(;B[ol]C[[kb\]: Slow and solid.  I like to play moves like this, but you may also play directly at O12.]
;W[no]C[[kb\]: Surely an overplay.];B[nh];W[oh];B[og];W[ng]
;B[mh];W[oi];B[pj];W[mi]
(;B[mg]C[[kb\]: This move is crude.  I would extend straight out to M12.]
;W[nf];B[mf]
(;W[ri];B[qh];W[sh];B[sg];W[sf]
(;B[mk]C[[kb\]: This move is a little too close to White's stone.  I would play it one farther back, or lean off of the lower White stones.  You can still invade later.]
;W[li];B[ne]C[[kb\]: N15 is correct shape (no weaknesses).]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[qi];B[ph];W[qj];B[pk];W[rk];B[rl]
;W[sk]TR[rl]C[[kb\]: This stone is very important for Black, devaluing White's territory by at least 8 points on the lower right.]
;B[kk];W[ji];B[kh];W[ki];B[ik];W[kg]C[Hon: I think this was a mistake, giving me the high point.

[kb\]: Yes.];B[hi];W[lh];B[ig]C[[kb\]: Good, keep the pressure up.]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[hh];B[ih];W[jj];B[kl];W[hj];B[ij];W[ii];B[gi]
;W[if];B[hg];W[id];B[jc];W[le]TR[ne]C[[kb\]: Now you can see why O15 was a mistake.  Black loses tempo.]
;B[me];W[hd];B[hc];W[fe]C[Hon: For my taste white found back into the fight too easily. Where did I mess up?

[kb\]: White is still not safe.];B[jf];W[kf];B[je];W[jg]
(;B[gg]C[[kb\]: Are you sure these stones are in danger?];W[jd]
(;B[ie];W[he];B[hf];W[ke];B[jh];W[lg];B[if];W[kc];B[kb];W[lb]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[mb];W[gc];B[jb];W[fc]C[Hon: So here he lives with profit, and all I can do is to try to sacrifice those stones ...]
;B[dg]C[[kb\]: A little wide.  Keep it safe.]
(;W[ee];B[cg]C[Hon: ... but was there maybe a better way for him to refute that attempt?]
;W[gj];B[hl];W[fi];B[gh];W[bg];B[bh];W[eg]C[[kb\]: Very sharp from White.]

;B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[bo];B[bp];W[am];B[ao];W[bk]C[Hon: I am sure this fight was full of mistakes. If you spot them, please tell me about them.]
(;B[lp]C[[kb\]: This was the right play, now I'm not so sure, since Black is so thick.  I think you can afford to invade deeper.]

C[Hon: Here I was a bit lucky that my stones were in just the right place to be able to break free. The next fight will lead to his annihilation, but earlier in the game I felt that I was a bit outplayed here and there, like when he lived in the upper left and left side.

Please help me to understand this awkward game a bit better. Thank you!

[kb\]: No luck about it.  Your influence is better than his!

You played well, except for not giving up K14 stones and missing that you could save all your stones in the center.  Don't underestimate the influence you can gain from attacking groups!]
