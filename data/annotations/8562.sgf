C[Dear David,
This was a prety good game for you.
In the beginning, you missed some oportunities on the left side, I think, but after your opponent didn't see the ladder in the centre, the game was over.
My remarks start with F:];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[de];W[fc]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[cn]MA[bb]C[F: Normally white would finish the joseki at x (B18), but this is playable]
(;B[cl]C[i think is my first mistake. this pincer is way too tight. i wanted to make an extension from the upper left, but this was too close to white. was the shape in the upper left finished enough? the joseki was unfinished, i thought, but i wanted to respond to white in the lower left.

F: The problem with this move is that white has next an ideal splitting move. See variation]
;W[en];B[fp];W[di];B[el];W[gn]
(;B[bp]C[this move felt a bit odd. i was seemingly letting white block me into the corner. i was consulting a joseki dictionary, however. maybe i should have moved out on the right?

F: Moving out to the right seems better, White can't make a base in the corner]
(;W[co]C[F: Very bad. Variation];B[cp];W[hp];B[gl]C[i also considered a shoulder hit on D11, but i didn't see how my wall would be useful. i fear white's resultant wall could be used to attack my gro
up in the upper left

F: This is simple but ok, having an eye on the cutting point a H5]
;W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[in retrospect, i think a one-space pincer might have been better--emphasize the more-open right side.

F: This is ok, another option would be to try to eat the lone white stone at the Left side. See variation]
;W[ic];B[qn];W[nq]
(;B[qj]MA[ql]C[F: This leaves an invasion point at x (R8). See variation]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[kc];W[ff];B[bb]C[necessary? i sensed i was getting sealed in, but where should i have been looking to get out into the center?]
;W[db]
(;B[ch]C[i think i should have held back at c13. the c14 invasion looks nasty, right?

what would a good sequence for black look like following W c14? (See varations)

F: You should try to cut white D11 of from the other white stones and capture it. Make use of your wall at C6-F6]
(;W[ci]
(;B[cg]C[this didn't feel quite right, but i was worried about a c14 invasion.
F: See variation];W[gj];B[il];W[in];B[kl];W[on];B[pm];W[nm]
C[i was a little worried about handling my middle group];B[rp]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[rb]C[F: Tiime to have a look at the balance of the game:

I count; Bllack 7 points UL, 13 point LL, 8 points U side, 12 points R side = 40 points
             White  10 points U side, 6 points UR side, 20+ points lower side, but weaknesses, + komi = 34+ points

The game is still balanced, depending on what white can make on the lower side and in the middle.Good continuations from here on: see variations on next move]
(;B[pf];W[qg];B[pg]C[i was tempted not to push from behind, but white's turn at q13 didn't look good to me. i think q14 was initially misplaced.]
;W[je];B[ji]C[i thought the time was right to jump into white's growing moyo up top
F: Good move];W[jk]C[F: Overplay];B[ik];W[jl];B[jj];W[kk];B[jm]
;W[ll];B[km];W[im];B[lk];W[kj];B[lj];W[ki];B[kh];W[li];B[mi]
C[F: After this white mistake the game is over];W[hl];B[hk]
;W[hm];B[gk];W[oe];B[lh]C[F: Right . White lost 12 points and black is so stron in the middle now that white can't expect ot make much of his moyos.]
