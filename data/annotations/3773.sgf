C[This game was played on Dragon at I used in excess of 100 hours on it. most of the questions are on the fuseki phase of the game, which I botched royally. I make a few comments during the game to explain my thought processes. Any and all comments/criticisms are welcome.

Thank You

Hi, I'll try to answer all your questions, and more, but if some points remain unclear, please don't hesitate to ask me, online or by e-mail.]
;B[pc];W[pp]TR[pe][qe]C[Being a low ranked player I almost always play Black. Would D16 be a better first move to give me a bigger 3rd move of K17?

[Sylvain\]
Q4 is a perfectly good move!
the Q17 stone 'works' rather on the right side than on the top, so Q4 makes that right side important for both players.
White's 3rd move will quite probably be bigger by approaching a corner than at K17... for instance at Q15 or R15]
;B[cc]C[[Sylvain\]
W should be happy: the 2 B stones don't work well together. Inverting the colors of C17 and Q4 would be better for B.]
;W[dp];B[qe];W[kc]TR[cc][jc]C[[Sylvain\]
Since C17 is quite far on the right, playing a bit more 'in the middle', at K17 might be more balanced.
Now, if B N17, W H17/G17 are a bit far from C17...];B[jq]
(;W[nc]TR[fc][dd][cj][dj][pj][qj]C[Two questions here.
1) I am certain that I remember reading that there is no rush to extend towards the invading stone. At present the extensions ar miai. When it actually came up this confused me as if left alone Black can extend towards one of my 4-4 stones and if I defend the corner he can extend towards the other. All I can come up with, and this took help from Mr. Bill Cobb (much later than this point in the game) was that the Black position was easy to invade.
2) The above aside I thought O17 was bigger. Was I correct?

[Sylvain\]
1) What you say is true:
- if you approach on one side, B will get the other
- if B plays there first, he might (depending on your defending the corner or not) get both extensions
- if B extends towards a corner at O3 or F3, he leaves a big weakness behind (at M and H3)

Conclusion: there is no rush!
W doesn't know yet what side will be more important for him, so settling the shape already might not be good, and might lose initiative too.
Even if B plays first, he cannot get at the same time a big and solid formation there.

2) No :)
For the same reasons, B has no rush in approaching L17.
It's true that I would be more comfortable at K17 as explained before, but O17 is small and doesn't put much pressure on B's solid corner enclosure.
Approaching the upper left corner or taking a big point on one side seems bigger now.
(see var for one example)];B[df];W[fd]C[[Sylvain\]
W's shape is a bit strange: F16 being high (4th line) W can slide under it, or invade and threaten a connection under.
If W wants to add a move, there is nothing simple :(
F17 also leaves a weakness, but keeps H16 as a good strengthening move.]
;B[nq];W[ch]TR[cd][ce]C[Here my opponent left out the defensive extension of C10 to play against my corner stone. I decided that my corner stone could take care of itself and played what I thought was a severe move against his corner position. Two questions here as well.
1) Is C12 a severe move? I certainly didn't make any use of it and couldn't detremine how as the game went on.
2) Even if C12 is severe should I have played at Q6 instead?

[Sylvain\]
1) I wouldn't use "severe", since there is no threat of killing or destroying anything here. But it's certainly a good offensive move threatening C15 or C16 to cut B apart or take away his base.
Since neither C12 nor F16 are very strong, W shouldn't imagine he will kill anything (yet) though.

2)
Q6 was possible too, but the choice is a matter of style.
If B comes at Q6 now, W will be in the lower right in a position quite similar to B in the upper left: not stable but in no real danger either (M3 remains).]
;B[qn];W[pn]TR[oo]C[[Sylvain\]
Not so good move.
W should either move out directly (like at P5) or hit on the other side.
W is strengthening the weak B stone, that's not good.
Remember:
- contact moves are defensive since they lead to mutual strength building
- always strengthen the stones that are already strong, so you can attack the weak ones.]
;B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[qp];B[pr];W[qk]TR[po][np]C[Again my opponent leaves out a defensive extension to press the attack. Should I have just defended rather than to go into this line?

[Sylvain\]
What you say about your opponent is true about you too!
W left out the usual defensive move of O4, what happens if B cuts through (at Q5)???

The Q4 group is too weak for you to launch an attack: W is just creating a second weak group in the area.

If W protected at O4, which is almost sente (keeps the initiative), then W might think about attacking. However even after an exchange like O4, N3, W group should first get safe by jumping out into the center before really launching an attack.]
;B[ql];W[pk];B[rl]TR[om][po]C[[Sylvain\]
yuk!
B should have cut, either at Q5 or maybe even better, at P7, leaving W in pieces...]
;W[om];B[pl];W[ol];B[po];W[oo];B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[or]C[The stones played at P3 and P2 were played as sacrifices to get time to make life.]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[qr];W[rr];B[nr];W[qs];B[os];W[ro]TR[nj][oj][ok]
C[I make life here because I can kill Black's weak group before he can kill mine, S7 being a big threat. But this lived in Gote allowing Black the cutting play at P9. Was there a way to live in sente that I didn't spot?

[Sylvain\]
Actually W should have died.
And you are right: even if W lives, the situation is not good for him.

Conclusion?

Give up the corner (which you should have lost anyway) and reinforce outside.]
;B[rn];W[so]
(;B[sn]C[[Sylvain\]
No! B loses a liberty :(];W[rp];B[sq];W[sr];B[rq]C[My opponent played many aji-keshi moves during the game.]
;W[sp];B[rq];W[sq];B[rk];W[rs]C[Now the throw-in works so I must defend.]
;B[ok];W[oj]C[This was a tough decision and I think I mad the wrong one. My idea was to build a little life for the group of stones at R9 to amintain some aji and to escape with the group at P6. I was unable to escape with the group at P6 and had to work very hard to make life for the group at R9. It didn't seem conceivable that I could win if I gave up both groups.

[Sylvain\]
It seems difficult to save even one, so choose one and keep to it.
P6 being bigger it seems more important to save it; losing P6 is actually at least as big as the corner :(]
;B[nk];W[hq]TR[pi]C[[Sylvain\]
Now W leaves his second group too :(

A B move around Q11 takes the whole right side.

Moreover, since B K3 is very strong, H3 is a bit too close (leaving F3 open). Locally, G3 or around K5 makes more sense.]
;B[jn]C[After this I realized that it was going to be tough to save the group at P6.

[Sylvain\]
It was tough even before, but it's too bad not to use P6's group's aji (reducing at K5 for instance) instead of helping B capture it.
W somehow induced this K6 move which is good for B.];W[ho];B[cm]
;W[ck]C[[Sylvain\]
Good direction.

B will have to live small, C12 gets stronger and now the upper left seems weak for B.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[bq];W[br];B[cp];W[dq];B[do];W[eo];B[dn];W[mn]
C[I think I could have saved the group by playing out along the seventh and eighth lines but I would have given my opponent overwelming influence. Here I looked at 'everything' and playing next at M8 seems to save my bacon.

[Sylvain\]
Playing along the 7th or 8th line might help reduce, whereas N6 is only giving up more prisoners.

Since B didn't answer H5, K5 L5 K4 L4 L6/L3 might be a better reducing solution, but L6 leads to a tough fight.

P6 still has some aji, if W cannot use it right now... just wait!

Now is a good time for attacking in upper-left.];B[ll]C[Well everything except M8, Doh.]
;W[lm]C[I decided to build a little aji for later as I think the response of M8 is forced.

[Sylvain\]
But answering it now might become aji-keshi... Either read it out and if big enough or sente, play it, or play elsewhere.]
;B[kl];W[pj];B[nj];W[rj];B[qi];W[qj];B[rm];W[oh];B[of];W[ni]
;B[lj];W[jp]C[Here I decide to use some of that aji to scoop out the underside of his position.

Now W starts looking weak...];W[ec]C[At the time I was unaware that my stones at C9 and C12 were in danger!

[Sylvain\]
Since C4 is not 100% alive yet, W should pressure it to stabilize his group.

Then I'd be more worried about P10 than F16.];B[hc]C[[Sylvain\]
Seems abusive.
C17 is not so strong yet.];W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[jc];W[jd]C[I think L16 is much better. At this point I hadn't seen F18 reaching a position where I have to use sente to create a Ko fight where I have to make the first Ko threat.

[Sylvain\]
L16 is better, but if W should look for ways to use his thickness in case he cannot kill.

C15?];B[kb];W[lc];B[lb];W[mb];B[fb];W[eb]
(;B[ia]C[G18 creates the previously mentioned position. I think I can kill both F19 and G17. My big question here is if Black had played G18 would it have been better to use sente to play elsewhere giving my opponent the choice to live or respond? If that is reasonable I can keep making that decision at each move. My thought was to play at M12 but as it didn't come up I never actually decided on which play might be best if I was going to allow hime to live.

[Sylvain\]
I probably could have made more comments if you had lost that game, but anyway...
W had a hard time in the beginning/early middle game, mainly because he:
- created several weak groups (Q4, P6, P10, C12)
- didn't use the initiative to attack (especially in upper left, and a little in lower left)

W seems to be a good reader/fighter and killing H17 or cutting at P16 saved his game.

However I'd say that W has to focus on:
- shape (ex: F16 was not so good, and not easy to use)
- direction (strengthen strong stones, attack weak ones)
- sacrifice (giving up LR and consolidating P6-P10 would have made for a much easier game)

Keep working on reading and Life&Death, since even 9p do, but try to think about the above 3 points.

Good luck, and don't hesitate if you have questions.])
