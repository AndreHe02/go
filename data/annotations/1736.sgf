(;W[qf]C[W: I like fast approaches because they can lead to interesting and unbalanced positions.]
;B[mc];W[rd]C[This is  bit slack when B does the two-point knights move because it induces a play on the 3-3 point which makes the large nights move extension ideal.  This is playable, but not the best.]
;B[qc];W[qi];B[qp]C[This is hard to judge.  B on the star point in the upper left seems more consistent with the stone on N1, but this gives B an approach and pincer from nearly any direction w would now approach a b group.

If B wants to play in this corner, I think star point or even p4 is a bit better for b here, because of how it then relates to D4, but it is hard to say.]
;W[cc]C[Playing a 3-3 in a handicap game is a bit dicey if B knows how to build and handle influence, but it is playable and can give w a free hand elsewhere.  Let's see what happens.]
;B[ed];W[ce];B[hd]C[White is low all over.  This seems somewhat inconsistent with the idea of approaching early to create unbalanced positions - your play to this point is not setting up fighting game because w has no where to fight from or run to since w is low all over the board.  But it is early yet.

For 10 I prefer J17 in this situation or maybe h17 - take your points on the side and potential to build a moyo from the stones - now not really possible.]
;W[fq]C[Game over.  You must appoach high, play in the middle of the position, or approach the stone in the lower right.

You asked where you went wrong - if there is one move this is it.  B should pincer around J3 or H3 or even J4 to make use of the right hand corner stone.]
;B[cm]C[A pincer seems called for.  Since W is alread on the left side, 12 should be at c6, not c7.  But it is playable.  But W ought not slide - would make things too simple.  So a 3-3 invasion or stone around k4 looks right.  B is so loose in the corner that the W stone on f3 is in no danger so W can be a bit more adventursome here - and needs to be.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[iq]C[Ouch.  Now a b move to n3 an the game is really hard for W.

Where did W go wrong - here -see comments about upper right.  the 15 must be at F5 or F6 or G4.]
;B[lq]C[Oops.  One line too far.  W should punish immediately by plotting and executing an attack on the lower corner - either split B into two groups with a running fight, or just take the 10 points there leaving B with no prospects for development because of the strong w formation on the right.]
;W[ld]C[W: A play around C11/C12 would be big, but I thought now is White's chance to reduce the top.

On reflection, though, maybe I think White can let Black have one more move on the top because the moyo is open at the bottom. On the other hand, it is probably good that White starts doing something active now in order to see how Black reacts, and to see if he can start to overcome the nagging lead that the 2-stone handicap confers on Black.

So, it seems to me that White has three choices: 1) to extend on the left; 2) to reduce the top 3) to approach the bottom right, say with P4.

I do not know which of these possibilities would have been best. Please help me :-)

Since both b and w have played on the left and have low, solid positions, the left side is played out for now.  First to play gets maybe 5-8 points more - and that in gote since the other side will not be pressed to answer since a responding move would be worth even less to the second to move.  So a move there is not useful - unless one is playing to build small, solid territories and then staking the whole game on a wild invasion of a large territorial framework - but there really aren't any in this game.

If you are going to address the situation on the top, you need to think hard about what you want to do.  The shoulder hit here is worthless - giving B more solid territory in exchange for what?  A weak stone which will be a burden on W.  No wall can be built from this stone of much benefit to W here.  If W wants to play on the top side, then a cap at n14 seems best.  Or even n15 which forces a response.  Then switch to the bottome around Q5 and use the shoulder hit to build a terriotorial framework of sizeable proportions.

Since B is open under the two stones on the top left and at s18, and since an invasion is still doable at k17, playing on the topside is not urgent.

Think bigger.  Think power and influence.

This move and the next by black are the single moves which most define the character of the rest of the game.  W played in the wrong part of the board and b responded incorrectly - and that set up all that follows - the two walls and what they mean.]
;B[md]C[W: Black responds positively by resisting.

Well, I would simply play b m17, w l16, b k17, all connected - w has nothing but two stones looking very lonely and burdensome.

So I think B18 is a mistake here.  B wants to play to connect the dots and get sente to make a play to finish the formation at the bototom.  Both sides should be willing to give up something to get sente here.]
;W[le];B[me];W[lf]C[So what does this wall do for you?  B can connect up underneath with L17 and the two stones are otherwise resilient - with a helpful group to run to in the lower left.

BTW, it was a serious missplay for b to push a second time - terribly overconcentrated now.

B should now play to strengthen the two stones on the top - I like K17 here - takes points and threatens to connect, limits the power of the three w stones.]
;B[qm]C[Ooops.   Perhaps the right general part of the board but wrong direction of play here.  If anything, play at P4.]

(;W[qq]C[W: When I played here, I though I had shown good timing, but now I think I should have waited. Now I think that White should play M17 then turn at N14. Then if Black moves to secure the bottom right, go in hard (see var.).

Very hard choice.  You are playing more like a high-handicap game than a 2-stone game.  I would play to settle things for w up top a bit.  I like the simple turn at n14, but that does give b the chance to settle the bottom.   So all in all, I think you need to come in now.  The question is where and for what purpose.  Note how loose the b stones are - remember the stone on M3 is too far way (or was until R7 - but it is still loose, even if placed ok now).  Your play attaching underneath will live in the corner at a huge cost of outside influence which will mean that you cannot develop points in the center or on the upper right, and it means you give up the right to attack the stone on M3.

So I would look to play a bit looser - looking to reduce B, maybe cut off one side or the other, and building outside influence that could be very valuable if you get to make the turn at N14.

So I like something around O4 or O3.];B[pq];W[pp];B[qr];W[rq]
;B[op];W[po];B[qo];W[pr];B[oq];W[qs];B[pn]C[W: I get a small life in the corner and some ladder aji at Q5, so I am not too unhappy. Still, Black has not done anything wrong that I can see.

You should be very unhapy with this result.  Especially since W is not entirely alive - lots of aji here yet.

The ladder doesn't work for you and B doesn't need to capture the cutting stones because of the corner aji and strength of the group in general.  But it is worth something - but you should play it soon because it will disappear soon.]
;W[lc]C[No.  This had to be the turn at N14.  Then attack with impunity and look to create at least a few points from the formation on the right.]
;B[mf]C[Though big, I think B at E14 is better - B is ahead and so playing simply to reduce w and to solidify the one remaining weak group seems more sensible than setting up to attack w on the right and to allowing w to attack the two b stones.]
;W[ef]C[W: An attack and a ladder-block, trying to put the aji of Q5/4 to good use.

Well timed, but I'm sure B will ignore the aji of the ladder and settle his group.]
;B[hf];W[hb]C[W: I suppose J18 would have been more honest, but I am sure that I have seen much stronger players use this kind of extra-long extension, too, and I wanted to make the game more complex (since I am giving a handicap). My aim is to provide some possible eye-shape for the M17/14 chain and to rob Black of the chance to get eyes at the top.

You played the ladder breaker - but then didn't play out the ladder.  What does this tell you about the aji?  Even you see it as only small.

Hard formation.  I think your stone is in the right place to do what you say you want to do.

But do you really want to set the b group running?  If you do that, what will happen?  Who will have influence and potential to build points in the center then?]
;B[dc]C[Are we having fun yet?];W[hh]C[dicey, but I think correct for what you said you want to do.  But can your wall group handle the fallout from this?]
;B[jg];W[lh];B[ji]C[Count the w groups.  5.  Count the b groups.  4 - and one running to join its friends.  Which reflect more efficient use of stones?

BTW, If I had been B here, Iw ould have simply lived on the side (starting with J18) so that I could build  something from my lower right group.]
;W[lj];B[ll]C[46 has to hurt a lot.  Game over.  W can connect back to the right or continue to attack the b group.  W is so far behind that the latter seems required if W can see a way to do it while gaining some points, settling the uppper side w group and getting some points on the left side.  tall order.  I like the peep at G15 to start things out.]
;W[mg]C[W: I was pleased with this move. It looks slow, but it strengthens my group in the centre considerably and aims to connect to the side. Also, it raps N14 on the head, which is surely a good thing. If Black had played here, then I could have been subjected to a painful splitting attack.

Excellent move, except that you need to time it a bit better - earlier or after a few sente moves against the b group on the top left - which could leave you settled and this move unnecessary.  It will now induce S17, I should think, which is painful for you, or B can solidify by L13, J18 (etc), and F15.]
;B[rc];W[oe]C[Meaningless.  Much better would be Q10 or S15.]

C[W: White has strengthened himself in the centre, so now I guess is the time to go for it with the attack.

Well past time.  B should have played here first - leaving almost anytime from the upper right to get it.]
;B[gd];W[he];B[fe]
(;W[ff]C[W: No, this is surely too soft. Should I have driven through with J15?]
;B[ie];W[gf];B[ic]C[W: Black links up and White's chance is gone.]
;W[if];B[jf];W[ig];B[ih];W[hg];B[jd]C[I don't teach details of fighting in these commentaries, but this did not turn out well.  It was too much one stone after another and unwilling to sacrifice.]

;W[or];B[nm];W[nl];B[om];W[lk]C[Ok, not to be too harsh, but what were you thinking here?  B is connected, B has a powerful, flawless wall facing a strong position with strong stones above - so b will get some points in the middle as well as making the group alive.

Go back to when you invaded at M6 and compare the result if you just had played Q10.  Same thing only W is stroinger and has potential for future action and B has some bad aji yet.]
;B[ci]C[W: Big, but maybe C10 was safer. On the other hand, if C11 then White can play C12 dividing the left side up equally, or  an invasion at C9 or perhaps a shoulder hit at D9.

Much bigger than 87 W M9.  None of your stones were under attack.  How many points from 87?  7 or 8 maybe?  How many here now?  15 - 20 or more  given how it plays with the w and b positions.

It's hard to find the right placement here. D9 plays well with the other groups looking at a follow on around F5 or g4.  I think I like d10 here best.]

B 106 feels right, but probably J10 is better.];W[ij];B[cr]
;W[er];B[fo];W[gr]C[W: I wanted to be more-or-less certain of life before trying to do something to reduce the centre. But was this move too humble? K2 is bigger, but then H4 or G4 by Black becomes sente and the centre is getting worrying.]
;B[jr];W[ir];B[io]C[Now W is boxed in - W has to move out to stop B from getting 25 points in the center - or else the moves at M9 and J10 are meaningless.]
;W[ii];B[jh];W[gj];B[jj];W[hj];B[pj]C[W: This seems nicely timed by Black.

Shoulder hit is garbage here.  Contact play or actually play on S2.  But not here - nothing to be gained now.]

;W[qk];B[nj];W[re]C[W: I wanted to collect opportunities to play big sente moves at T17 and C1, and decided that it was worth letting Black take with N9 (worth six points, but S15 followed by T17 is worth at least as much).]

W: I thought Black played very well and solidly in this game (with the exception of missing the incursion at K19) and deserved to win. However, I find it difficult to isolate anything to blame for my defeat, although there were one or two dubious moments such as G2. Please help me! I also promised to e-mail the review to my opponent, who is a long-standing IGS buddy. Perhaps, really, we played about equally well (badly!) and the result was the inevitable consequence of the 2-stone handicap.


W gained back about 12-15 points in the end game and w should have lost by at least 10.

Note that at the end W has 4 groups and b has 2.  B should have done better  in the end game in the left-lower center and on the right side.

For W the biggest problem was playing too small, not enough for power and influence, too much for local territory or to reduce local territories.  B was better at that aspect of the game.  However, W was the better fighter in hand-to-hand combat in the endgame, the B had his moments.

The problem for W was how to create solid groups and to reduce and invade and attack at the right times.  That is a problem that troubles all go players from your strength to professionals.

Pretty much the best I can say is to see the board on a larger scale  and work on assessing the relative value of parts of the board.]
