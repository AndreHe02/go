AB[pd][dp][dd][pp]C[Ok, I am 20K* on NNGS. I took four stones and a Komi of 3.5 as sugested by the NNGS server against GnuGo.
I know I am very poor at openings and defenses of corner attacks. So any help there would be good.
I use Jago for reviewing my games (don't like Jago's interface for matchmaking on the server tho.)
So theretofore I can watch alternate variations if you put them in.

Blessed thanks to he who comments this game for me.
Your ever humble servant Shai'tan

Note if you play at the star points for the first two moves it becomes a 6 handicap game.
See variations on following moves];W[qn]TR[jd][dj]C[play away from white]

(;B[qo]TR[np][jd][dj][jp]C[note in handicap play look for area more then direct attack. i am looking at the dictionary of basic joseki #3 by Yoshio Ishida from the ishi press.

better move for you is O4, or play at the star points for 2 moves one Joseki is as follows with the 4x4 point stone in place r6-o4-s4-r3-r9-k3 [see variation1]
;W[nq];B[oq]TR[np]C[white has set up a condition to move in to the corner. had #2 been at O4, w could not play O3.
moves 1 and 3 have set up a trap play by white];W[cn];B[co]
TR[fp]C[same coment here note you can not kill the w stones so get area]
;W[fq];B[eq]C[at this point w is well on the way to getting the lower side]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[cf];B[ce]C[Ok this attack and defense is getting redundant.. Am I defending right or should I do something else.

for white it is great but for you you are getting behind in points
w now has a good jump on two sides];W[qf]C[now three sides]
;B[qe];W[nc];B[oc]TR[qc][qq][cq][cc]C[Woohoo Very pretty board.. but is it a decent defense.. Looks to me like white has all four of my corners locked in and I will have to FIGHT my way out insted of casually aquiring more territory.

this is true. and note each corner is not yours as an attack at the 3x3 point will live]
;W[fd];B[ed];W[nd];B[od];W[jd]C[white now settles the upper side with #21]
;B[of]C[good move to get out into the center];W[pn];B[pf];W[rf]
;B[ne];W[dn];B[do];W[qi];B[qg];W[fp];B[ep];W[df];B[en]CR[bo]
[bp][bq][cq][dr][er][pb][qb][qc][rc][rd][re]C[Ok I am sitting here thinking.. If I could just get a stone at all of the circles they will live, or at least I hope they will that would give you 4 points with the 4 eyes.

 think bigger. each corner is worth 15 points or more];W[dj]
;B[np];W[jp];B[mq];W[rg];B[qh];W[mn];B[fo]C[note look at the moves you made that white did not answer. this would indicate that it was not the best move.]
;W[rh];B[pg];W[re];B[rd];W[hk];B[nn];W[oi];B[pi];W[ng];B[pj]
;W[rj];B[qj];W[ql];B[ri];W[rk];B[ol];W[nj];B[si]TR[re][rf][rg]
[rh][qf]C[OK I think this was a good move on my part.. kept the triangle group dead and seperated from the group at S10 which looks like it has good escape potential.. but was this necessarry or could I have played somewhere else?

Later on in the game I can see that the triangle group stays dead even to the end of the game.. so It might have been worth it.. what would have happend here if I didn't..

count the points with t11 you got 14 points. counting the 5 dead stones. had white played there first you lost those points so it was a good move]
;W[lp]C[white has to make more then that point wise with the moves at 59 & 61]
;B[lq];W[ob];B[pb];W[nb];B[oa]TR[fb][bf][bn][fr][jq][le][gm]
[ho][el]C[66 is worth 4 points that you keep but look at how you can reduce white area. that is worth more points to you]
;W[be];B[bd];W[bf];B[ae];W[nm];B[mm];W[ml];B[lm];W[mo];B[nl]
;W[no];B[om];W[oo];B[mk];W[ll];B[jj]TR[nk][pk][ok][on][po][op]
[ji][kj][jk][ij]C[Ok right here I am thinking the group @ M8 is dead IF i can get it into a ladder but a ladder will lead right to the group @ F16 so I have to stop that. But in putting a tone to stop it from connecting an living I lost ground in the next couple of moves... *Shai'tan scratches his head.. what the heck happened?*

     a ladder only will work if you can keep it going. as you could not keep it going the white stones escape. if you will look at your stones they are not connected. there are cut points all over the place that white can use to attack you with.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[kj];B[kk];W[km];B[jm];W[lj];B[mj]TR[ok]C[at this point you need p9 to connect]
;W[pk];B[oj];W[ok];B[ni];W[nk];B[qk];W[pl];B[po];W[lk];B[mi]
;W[lg]TR[el][gn][hn][fb][jq][op][bn][fr][le]C[stay out of the ladder and connect or move for a reducing move]
;B[ln];W[kn];B[lo];W[ko]C[Ok that was stupid on my part.. i should have done something else besides chase that line between two diff units

 play the ladder if you can use the stone for an attack if not do not play it. you may be able to come back later and use those stones in an attack.
forceing white to take them and getting an extra move];B[gp]
;W[gq];B[hq]C[I think this should have been a ladder.. and the loss of control in this area costs me a lot later in the game..]

;B[mc];W[hb];B[mb];W[in];B[kf]C[OH YEA THAT FELT GOOD.. Killing 6 stones without removing them from the board. but what did I lose by doing that? should I have done it or were the dead all along and I could've gained more ground by maybe going off to the center left.

you needed to do that.  that move was worth 16 points to you. + the moves to reduce the center]
;W[hh];B[je];W[ie];B[kd];W[jb];B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[id];B[ka]
;W[ee];B[ji];W[jk];B[jn]C[wasted move on my part.. should've done something else but it pays off much later in the game.. saves me almost 12 points.. so was it really wasted.. what if I had gone somewhere else like attempting to join the stones at L14 to the almost dead stones at H16

saved you 12 points was worth it.];W[eb];B[db];W[ij];B[ik];W[il]
;B[jh];W[jr];B[ih];W[ig];B[ge];W[de];B[cd];W[ef];B[gf];W[ro]
TR[rp]C[you can not let white have the corner
S4 is a better move];B[hg];W[hf];B[gg];W[rq];B[if]C[This was utter stupidity.. I say it right after I placed it.. funny thing is gnugo thought about it's response for almost a minute.. i wanted to connect these two groups by killing off a stone... I would like a variation here detailing how I could have done it. or is it even possible?

i do not see any way to connect the stones at this point];W[jf]
;B[hi]MA[gh]C[ok that was dumb.. I am gonna lose the H16 group because of that one move... I am not worried aobut the stone at K15 cuz if major neccesity charges in I can take the stones @ N12 take care you do not get into a snap back move

Maybe I should have gone at G12 instead.. given myself a little more room to manuerver with the H16 group?

h11 was good];W[gh];B[gi]C[Nope lets compound the mistake by forcing him to capture those stones..]
;W[fh];B[ke]TR[ii]C[you needed j11];W[ii];B[hj];W[ik];B[ja]
;W[he];B[ia];W[ib];B[ha];W[pr];B[ga];W[fg];B[fa];W[nr];B[or]
;W[mp];B[op];W[os];B[mr];W[ns];B[ms];W[ps];B[ea]C[OK that line on row 19 was amazing I never thought any normal person would allow me to do that..  but hey.. it worked. and I only lost control of the lower right hand corner to do it

i would let any one do it all those moves and you got no points. but lost all the corner]

;B[bl];W[jc];B[bk];W[bj];B[ak]C[OMG a living shape.. !! I got up and danced at this one cuz I knew I could eat up territory with anything snaking off of this.. I may have used its power wrong though.. please advise..

if you look at your stones they are not connected except for the live group. me i like live groups to]
;W[fl];B[ek];W[ej];B[aj];W[ai];B[ci];W[bi];B[cj];W[dk];B[fk]
;W[gj];B[gk];W[ei]C[I like it that whites only choice was to take that group.. it left me a chance to do the following..]
;B[gl];W[hl];B[gm];W[fn];B[hm];W[im]C[this was a bad choice by gnu I think.. I prolly would have gone at H6 if I was white.. I wonder what would have happened

not a bad move for white];B[hn];W[eo];B[jo]C[this is where those two shapes saved me 12 points.. plus a bit on the side..

i think w made the correct choice];W[jg];B[sj];W[rl];B[sk]C[is this well served? if I had gone at A5 would it have been better?

they are];W[ao];B[sl];W[sm];B[ch];W[tt]C[gnu passed here.. she gnu she had won]
;B[kp];W[on];B[qq];W[nm];B[qr];W[rr];B[qs]C[this was a god send.. I hadn't realized I could live in this area until I started placing stones in hopes.. especially after w responded the way she did

yes bad play by white you saved all the stones there];W[kr]
;B[pq];W[lr];B[rs];W[sq];B[ss];W[sp];B[ls];W[ks];B[cs];W[rp]
C[Lower left corner.. could it live in any way shape or form or is that a hope less battle?
if you count freedome you will see that white wins any capture race.]
;B[bs];W[fs];B[br];W[er];B[sr];W[cp];B[qp];W[rn];B[rm];W[sn]
;B[cg];W[bg]C[I think after this point it is just my hopeless flailing aobut to fill in Dame and maybe force gnu into a mistake.. just me seeing if I can squeeze an extra point here or there. unsuccesfully I must add.

but not to be forgotten. in some rules you must fill Dame.]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[js];W[is];B[hg];W[gg];B[eq];W[fr];C[I lost by 15.5 points.. all I needed was probly one stone different.. one stone that I goofed... one one one.. darn!! *hits self in head with stone*

Thank you kindly for commenting my game.. I hope my comments on my own game were amusing and helped you to see what I was attempting to do and what I was thinking.

i think you did good if you look at how white captured some of your stones you can look at moves on how to connect them . but remember some times you want to give up stones to set up a play for more area. so 3-4 stones do not matteras long as you can get 7-10 points in exchange.

i hope my comments help you. i am only a 9-10kyu player so remember what i see as better moves may over look great moves some where else on the board.

i play on line at www.zone.com/go
my log on is humfeeder
humfeeder = hummingbird feeder
as i feed hummingbirds all year

i hope this helped you
