C["She was able to sew up the corners really well and leave me with a relatively small space in the middle. I think I made some moves that were low value that let her get away with this but I'm not sure what they were."

[my review comments are in brackets.
overall white played a better opening sequence than black. this resulted from white being first to take territory in open areas before black which sometimes reacted to a non-threatening move when other open areas were available to be played in.\]]
;B[pd]C[JUSTINE: Hi!
SwampBug: hi!
JUSTINE: good luck!];W[dp]C[SwampBug: thanks
SwampBug: I'll probably need it];B[pp]C[JUSTINE: me too.];W[cd]
C[SwampBug: hehe];B[qj]C[JUSTINE: where are you from?
SwampBug: USA];W[ec]C[SwampBug: Washington DC
SwampBug: you?
JUSTINE: ok.];B[dj]C[JUSTINE: i'm from japan, close to yokohama.]
;W[nc]C[SwampBug: how is 2009?];B[lc]C[JUSTINE: as usual, except credit crunch.]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[SwampBug: things pretty bad out there?];W[pc]
C[[both sides playing a good opening sequence so far\]

JUSTINE: ya, getting worse.];B[le]TR[hc]C[[here it's better to take territory across the top, no need to escape to the centre\]

JUSTINE: you are still in 2008, 2009 will be better there with obama.]

TR[hc][hd][cg]C[[this move doesn't secure any territory and can be played later to reduce white's territory here. expand in available spaces on the left side or top\]]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[oj]C[[the first unusual opening move played by white. also better for her to play for territory on the top or left edges\]]
;B[nd]TR[hc][cg][ph]C[[this move limits white but doesn't guarantee much territory for black\]

SwampBug: yeah];W[ch]C[[white plays here first and gets the territory\]

SwampBug: thank God we got him elected];B[dh]TR[hc]C[[rather than reacting to moves that don't need immediate defense, be the first to play in a different new area.\]]
;W[hc];B[he]TR[ph]C[[still another open area left to play first\]]

;W[jc]C[[good move by white, take the last remaining place to expand territory\]]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[jo];W[jq];B[lp];W[lq];B[no]TR[kj]C[[here, even though black doesn't have much territory along the corners and edges, it has very much centre influence. this is a difficult style to play, since finding yourself in this situation, could try it out\]]
;W[fn];B[fo]TR[fr]C[[this won't succeed in cutting, better to reduce white from below\]]
;W[eo];B[go];W[en];B[dl]TR[el]C[[could get away with playing bigger here\]]
;W[mj];B[kj];W[sp];B[ro];W[bn];B[dm]TR[bm]C[[can stop white now since d8 was already secure\]]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[fl];B[fk]C[[to limit white's invasion into the centre, better to play a non-contact move to give a few moves time to build a better defense\]]
;W[bm];B[gl];W[gm];B[el]TR[hl]C[[better to reinforce a weakness than make an easily defendable threat--capturing f8 doesn't amount to much if white connects at g6 or threatens recapture at e7\]]
;W[hl];B[fm];W[gn];B[hk];W[in]C[[white is threatening to cut at j5 which would strand a group, defending against it is the biggest move\]]

(;B[hm];W[io]C[[while true white is likely to win this game, it is close enough to be interesting. enjoy the game and see where it goes, sometimes you can pull off an unexpected win which can only happen if you keep playing.

Keep on playing and enjoying the game and I hope this review helps you. Also, you can learn quicker by playing fair handicap games against different ranks and by watching games of players several ranks higher than your current.\]

SwampBug: ah
SwampBug: don't see anyway I can pull this one off
SwampBug has resigned the game.])
