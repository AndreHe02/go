Hi, my name is Greg. I'll be reviewing your game. I hope everything in here is good enough, but if you have more questions, feel free to email me afterwards as well. I will preface my comments with G:.

The game was pretty interesting. Lots of good places for me to comment. The game started out with a complicated but unforunately good for white sequence in the top left. It was good enough that I would already consider the handicap stone to be used up :/ However, after that, you missed your chances to be forceful and seriously attack or kill groups, and you didn't manage to gain back enough points in the end.

I think if I had to say one topic that might be most beneficial to study would be shape. You seem to miss vital shape points. It would at a nice sharpness to your game.

(;B[ee]C[G: When the opponent plays further than G16, you have more choices. F17 is a simpler choice here, if you don't want to deal with the intricacies of this joseki. However, since G16 is a bit further away, this should be slightly better than for black than if white played normally at G16.]
;W[ef];B[fe];W[cc]C[****this move is get complicate for me . I dont know how should respond.

G: Right. This is a more recent move, and I don't think it's very common. It's quite complicated, and can cover a chapter in a book, but since H16 is slightly out of place, here I don't think it is good. I'll try to show some variations.]

(;B[dd]C[G: Right of the bat, this move isn't great. It makes bad shape. It creates the same shape as if they got to hane at the head of two stones, right? Just look at only the triangled stones in the next position and you should see it. It is better to fall back a little here.]
;W[cd]TR[cc][dc][dd][de];B[df];W[ce]
(;B[eg]C[G: If you're going to play this way, you must come back and fix your shape instead of this move. You still have a chance to lock him in anyways. It looks slow, but is very strong. See the variation.]
;W[fc];B[ed];W[db];B[he];W[ec]
(;B[gd]C[G: It is better to play this on the outside. Ths wedge at G15 is of no consequence. Your shape gets bullied later with J15 right?]
;W[hc]
(;B[nc]C[G: Even now, J15 feels too pianful to let white have. I would prefer to extend there.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[if];B[gc];W[gb]
(;B[hb]C[G: In this shape, it is often better to cut at J16 and not here. Your stones won't be crawling along the second line.]
;W[fb];B[ib];W[jc];B[qn];W[cf];B[dg];W[lc]
(;B[qi]C[G: In cases like this, it is more common to play the double approach. The double approach on the 4x4 stone is considered very painful for the player with the 4x4 stone. This doesn't do as much to the other player.]
;W[mq]
(;B[kq]C[G: I think this move is a little hasty. I think there are larger moves elsewhere.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[G: I think this is block in the wrong direction. You should try and make a moyo on the left.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn]
(;B[dn]C[G: A note on exchanging this move. One usually prefers not to play this right away. You take away the possibility of playing C8 later. This move doesn't gain you much, but it restricts your options. It's not like you have a large moyo in the center and can enlarge it, so playing C8 might make more sense. you can make territory on the left later.]
;W[cm]
(;B[fp]C[G: This move is much too slow. In the pincer joseki family, one only plays this when the H3 stone is further away. When the H3 stone is there, instead of playing this, you'll often see pros playing L3 right after, so you can actually tenuki here. R3 is still a very nice point.]
;W[qp]
(;B[ql]C[G: This is too slow. The corner at the top right is larger. If white invades here, you can afford to run that stone out. Later, you can play P3 and heavily reduce his corner.]
;W[rd]
(;B[qc]C[G: This is not a common response to this move. I would prefer R15 here. See variation.]
;W[qg]C[G]
(;B[rc]C[G: There is a nice weakness in shape I would prefer to exploit here as black. See variation,]
;W[og];B[nf];W[oi];B[pj];W[mh];B[lf];W[of];B[ne];W[hg];B[ff]
;W[iq]C[G: This is an overplay on white's part. However, white has pretty much already won the game. He has more solid points, and you don't have enough potential to make anything in the center. He made a few mistakes later, which you could have capitalized on, but you missed your chances.]

G: This is my last comment. After this, you had one last attempt at taking the G10 stones, but the J10 black stones were too weak. Unforunately, once white lived, the game was decided.]
