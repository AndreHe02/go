;B[pp];W[cd]C[There's nothing wrong with a 3,4 opening point. I am circa 12kyu and tend to steer away from these as the joseki are complex - and it's easy to make a costly mistake. But by playing these you will learn !]
;B[pd];W[dq]LB[ed:A][ec:B][do:C][co:D]C[this is quite a strong opening - though the expectation is that black will approach at A or B (or either of C or D). If black c or D then white A.]
;B[pj]C[Black has played a san ren sai opening, the 3 star points. Good for influence, not territoiry oriented.]
;W[cj]LB[ed:A][ec:B]C[Though I'm not a super dan player, white 6 looks odd - better at A which woirks well foir an attack on a black stone near 6, or B if you want profit.]
;B[co];W[fq]LB[fp:A][cm:B]C[8 is low, A gives you better shape on the botton, B is a direct attack on 7.]
;B[cl]LB[bq:A]C[you now have let black get easy life - playing A is the only way you might frustrate him - but that is more yose than opening.
4 and 8 are not fundamentally alive - and there is a weakness around C13.]
;W[cg]LB[dg:A]C[10 is low - lots of stones on the third line. You should balance 3rd and 4th line so you mix ability to get out into the centre ("there is no territory in the centre" means you can destroy any attepmt by your opponent to make territory there.) A ius better than 10.]
;B[el];W[ej]LB[fn:A]C[Was this the right response to black's invasion on left side?
No. Attack from your weak side  - which is the D3-F4 group. A might work]
N[Was this the response?];B[eo]LB[hq:A]C[now black is very strong and D3 - F3 is relatively very weak. Note the word relatively. What would you do if black played at A?]
;W[jq]LB[hq:A]C[you have a very invoiting hole at A for black to enter and cause havoc. - you will have two weak groups - bad news.]
;B[lq];W[nq]C[Ahh! 16 is weak - you've jumped into your oppenents strength. It's difficult to claim 15 is the weak stone.]
;B[pq];W[lp];B[no];W[mp]C[Was this move necessary? Or should I have extended into the center]
;B[nm];W[jd]C[black's response to 18 was not normal - but that's life. However Black stakes out a big moyop on right side . 22 is not a bad moove.]
;B[ld];W[gd]LB[jf:A]C[the idea of a moyo is to tempt the opponent to invade - and he either lives small or dies. what ever happens, you gain strength to attack .A would be better.]
;B[kc];W[jc];B[qc];W[hp]LB[jj:A][ng:B][og:C]C[I noticed that I had nothing in the center and was trying to somehow extend.
I'd be tempted to play a big moyo move at A with B or C as follow-up.]
;B[cq]
(;W[dr];B[cr];W[cs];B[dp];W[eq]C[Again, not sure if this move is necessary, played it just in case. Maybe lost points because of it?]
;B[ep];W[pg]C[Attempting to cut the two black groups

Beware you are well inside black's moyo (the line between 5 and 23 creates a sector. If you are inside (black's side of) the sector line you need to live. Sitting on the sector line or just outside is a way of reducing your opponernts territory whilst getting out  - not getting killed.]
;B[qg];W[qh]C[Wasn't too sure If I should have extended towards center or fought]
;B[qf];W[ph];B[qj];W[nh];B[lf];W[lh]C[Attempting to stop black from taking so much area in center]
;B[jf]LB[jh:A]C[you need to keep runnning - so 46 MUST be at A]

(;W[gf];B[ih];W[gj];B[gl];W[lj]LB[mk:A]C[50 - you need to think about life. A may be better]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[fp];W[jo]C[Another attempt towards center];B[ho]
;W[iq]LB[ij:X][ke:Y][gh:Z]C[Wasn't sure If i should have played J3 or J4. Hindsight suggests maybe J4 o J5 might have been better? 
56 at J4 much better - you are just inviting the atari. Also is this big? you may be better off playing X, Y or Z.]
;B[io];W[ip];B[ln];W[ko]C[Again, not sure if this move was necessary, or if there was a better move perhaps? I considered extending to K7 but wasnt sure if I could survive]
;B[jn];W[jj]C[another attempt to seperate black, was hoping to eventually invade top right area]
;B[jl];W[ll];B[nj]C[R];W[nf];B[ij]C[Realized here I should have played J10 and that my white pieces barely have any room for eyes]
;W[ik]C[My attempt to try and connect the best I can];B[hk]
;W[hj];B[ii];W[jk];B[il];W[nl]C[Attempt to secure maybe more area so I can make eyes]
;B[ol];W[ml];B[ok];W[jh];B[ig];W[gh];B[mi];W[li];B[kl]LB[mh:a]
C[black 83 was poor - what would happen if he'd played at a? (N12?) - you die all over the place.!]

;B[kn];W[mm];B[nn];W[pf];B[pe];W[kb];B[lb];W[lc]C[Made a mistake...]
;B[mc];W[jb];B[ie];W[id];B[he]C[Should I have perhap blocked differently instead of J16 to secure more area?]
