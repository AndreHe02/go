C[buckyyowza: comments by Mark Fyffe.  I am 4k on IGS, 1k on KGS last I played there.  I hope you find my comments to be of use.

Phoenix [11k\]: hi



To the reviewer:



I'm

black in this game and I'm playing against someone I play fairly often on

KGS.  I usually lose against him and I feel like I'm hitting a wall in my

go grogress (I've been lingering in the the 12-13k range for a bit too long

for my liking) and the fact that I'm losing most of my games by a pretty

small margin is pretty frustrating so any comments on my style will be greatly

appreciated.



I know that my biggest weakness is in attacking in the

early mid-game and I often tend to miss oppurtunities to attack so advice

on those areas would be particularily helpful :)];B[dp];W[pd]
C[exswoo [12k\]: Hi again.];B[pp];W[cd];B[qf]LB[ed:A]C[buckyyowza: A (e16) is a more common approach in this opening.  since white played komoku (3-4 point), it seems natural to keep his thickness divided, to exploit his intent on territorial play.]
;W[nd];B[pj]LB[pi:A]C[This is the opening that I play 80% of the time.

buckyyowza: it is not a bad opening. although I am inclined to play this stone at A (q11) instead because white is more concentrated in that direction.  regardless, due to the white komuku at c16, this particular opening is still fairly uncommon.

the best way to learn a fuseki (opening) is to study how others use it.  if you find that a certain fuseki is natural for you, there is a library of professional games organized by fuseki available from http://gobase.org/fuseki.  if the pro games go a little over your head, the GTL also has games indexed by fuseki at http://gtl.jeudego.org/reviews/by_fuseki/.]
;W[qh];B[og]LB[ph:A][of:B]C[Correct response?

buckyyowza: although it is alone, r12 is not a weak stone.  it's friends at q16 and o16 provide considerable strength.  on the other hand, the black stone at r14 is a now a little cut off and needs help.  the keima (knight's jump) is used by a strong group to attack a weak group, so i would advise against this move.  depending on your intent, it would be better to jump to center with B (p14, focus on the corner) or attach with A (q12, focus on the center).]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[pi];B[nh]C[buckyyowza: the proverb says "ponnuki is worth 30 points of territory."  when white has captured q12, the resulting shape is called ponnuki.  it is a light, flexible fighting formation. as a rule of thumb, do not allow your opponent to form a ponnuki in a neutral area unless you get something very nice (worth 30 points) in return.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[pf];B[ni];W[qj]
(;B[ql]LB[pk:A]C[I
played this sequence too quickly and I definitely lost out big.  I tried

to make the most out of it by attacking white next.

buckyyowza: tactical blunders can often be turned into strategic victory.  if you ever feel that you blew it, take a deep breath and a close look at the board.  if this stone was played at A (q9), black's thickness would more than make up for the loss in potential territory on the right side.  even with r8, white's approach can still be minimized.

if your play leaves you in a weak position, attacking is usually not the best answer.  fighting back right away often makes things worse.  either defend what's left or play into a new situation. if your opponent is the same strength as you, he will often become overconfident and make a bigger mistake later on, but you can't count on that happening ;-)]
;W[pk]
(;B[pl]LB[oj:A]C[buckyyowza: A (p10) is more important.  white's right side base is not an advantage until it becomes thick in the center. (var. 20)]
;W[ok];B[ld];W[oe];B[mb]LB[qc:A][ed:B][id:C]C[buckyyowza: if you're interested in the UR corner, just play A (r17).  for upper side thickness, use B (e16).  to develop a base to counter white's right side, use C (j16).

although the second line can often be used for subtle tactics, n18 seems more like an endgame play.  not only that, but it is "aji keshi," that is it erases the opportunity to invade the corner at r17 (see b143).]
;W[mc];B[lc];W[nb];B[ec];W[gc];B[hc]LB[ee:A]C[buckyyowza: a jump to center at A (e15) is more effective here.  when you lose something you like (the upper side), don't just buy back what you can.  try to take something better... for example you can launch an attack on the left side in sente.]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[ed]
(;B[md]C[buckyyowza: it may be better to take some profit in the upper left corner, since you've started to play there with the approach at e17. see var 34.]

;W[en];B[fp];W[fm];B[el];W[fo];B[cf]C[buckyyowza: nice. it seems that white has decided this will be an easy game.  this play should change his mind :-)]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[ch];B[cg];W[di];B[eh];W[ei]C[Not quite what I had in mind ^^.

buckyyowza: you can't kill everything, but you can lose everything if not careful.  just count eyes and liberties and you'll see that this is favorable for black. see var.]

(;B[eg];W[fj];B[ek];W[fh];B[de];W[dd];B[gf]LB[fg:A]C[buckyyowza: be careful!  you are fond of the knight's jump, but watch your liberties. see var.]

;W[dn];B[gk];W[fk];B[fl];W[gj];B[gm];W[gn]C[buckyyowza: white walks right into a large ko]
;B[hm]LB[fn:A]C[buckyyowza: play at A (f6) instead leads to a fight for white's four stones on the left side because of the e5/g5 miai.]
;W[go];B[hk];W[gp];B[kp]LB[io:A]C[I felt that this was the best distance from the white stones.

buckyowza: white's stones are called a dragon.  that is, they are thick but have no eyes. A (j5) hits a little harder (drives white into a black controlled side) and takes some of the eye space.  your play is just as well except that it could drive white toward the strong group at p9.]

;W[ih];B[ig];W[jg];B[jf];W[kh]C[buckyyowza: this situation is exactly like the one i just mentioned at w84.]
;B[fg];W[fi];B[mf]C[buckyyowza: now we see a little more clearly why w58 was not too bad a result.  white has two baseless "dragon" groups to manage, while black has a strong fighting position.  territorially white leads easily, but only if he manages to save both dragons.]
;W[lg];B[kf]LB[jh:A]C[buckyyowza: don't be afraid of the ko. A (k12) starts an easy battle.  technically, a hanami ko: one in which only one side has something to lose. your move loses the battle before it begins.]
;W[jh];B[lh]LB[kj:A]C[buckyyowza: again, this helps white diffuse an attack before it begins. A (l10) puts a nice hole in white's eye space with little cost to black. this play helps white solidify before even being attacked.]
;W[li];B[mh];W[lj];B[io];W[fq];B[cq]LB[ep:A][gq:B]C[buckyyowza: it seems to be your downfall to sacrifice important stones ;-) imagine after playing A (e4) the possibility of a cut at B (g3).  your corner is not as threatened as it may seem.]
;W[ep];B[mq];W[jp];B[jo];W[ko];B[kn];W[lo];B[kq];W[ln];B[km]
;W[lm];B[iq];W[on]LB[er:A]C[buckyyowza: consider now an attack at A (e2). see var for how this leads to a ko for white's life.]

(;B[qn]C[buckyyowza: a quick count reveals that after this play, white leads by about 25 points.  white would like nothing more than a peaceful game from here on out.  with much of the board already settled, black's best bet is to attack anything left unsettled (see previous move and var 142).

you are too often following white's lead. although pretty big, r6 is no exception.  if you let your opponent dictate your play, you are also letting him dictate the outcome of the game.  why protect two stones and a few points in gote when you can attack 12 in sente and play for the game?  just like it can be wrong to play too aggressive when ahead, you can also be  too conservative when behind.]

;W[oo];B[mp];W[nn]C[With

my groups pretty much settled, I decided that reducing one of the white's

groups will be the only way I'll win.

buckyyowza: if played right, white's dragon in the lower left quadrant is good as dead. see w128.  b17 is also good for exploiting a white vulerability (see var.) being down by about 25 points, if left to endgame the best you can do from here is to lose by ten points.]

;B[rl];W[ol]C[buckyyowza: thanks for the chance to look over your game, this game was quite interesting and challenging to review.  here are my closing comments:

you are concerned that your weakness is attack in the early middle game, but I felt that was your greatest strength! (see b51)  after a couple of minor blunders, you did an excellent job of recovering with some brutal attacks on white's aggressive play in black thickness.  the problem was that you failed to realize that those areas were thick, and that white's groups were weak.

although your opening was a little unconventional, it was well played: the game developed early, and you struck hard.  when you go back through this game again, pay particular attention to places where ko could have been fought (look for threats), and to places where white's groups could have been reduced.  after getting easily settled on the upper corners, he never managed to get much of a base for any other groups.  all you had to do was move in for the kill ;-)

 you feel "stuck in rank."  there are many concepts to be learned in go:  some of them are quick to learn and others take a little more time to internalize.  these more difficult to absorb concepts are those that will eventually lead to stronger and more satisfying play.  whenever i feel stuck, i like to think it is because i am struggling with more difficult concepts, and i think this is the case with you: in this game your play seemed blind one moment, but amazingly lucid the next.  when i look through your game, i see several places where you fail to finish situations you may not even know you started.  i think when you begin to see these situations more clearly, you will undoubtably improve. see b35, b83, b105, b115 for example.

thanks again!  i always enjoy a chance to look over a game.  please feel free to contact me at mark@accessidaho.org if you have any questions.


I

was surprised that he didn't block at S-9.    Nothing interesting after this

sequence though :P
