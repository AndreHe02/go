If you play closer to the side you will have more support and it will be easier for you to make life]

You just made an empty triangle!

If you have not heard of them yet then learn NOW

Empty triangles are bad because they are ineficient, they cost a lot of moves to take a litte teritory.

In Go you must always strike a balance in the speed at whcih you progress, too much time spent in one area can lose you points in another

Yes I think you played some good moves and gave yourself the upper hand with more influence]
(;B[qd];W[ob]C[i like these two touching stone corner openings, they seem to guarantee corner ownership, but it may be a bad technique against a stronger player

I see you like to play this move and it is a teritory based move leaving you a good chance of keeping the corner but you must remember theat you don't always need the corner if you can gain an advantage elsewhere, for example you could play below whit in a pincer move that also connects well with your stones below]

The best thing for you to do is to think about influence during your games.

How can you use your other stones to help you, if you play a move how will it effect you later on, and how can it help to join your weak groups together.

Try to shepard your opponent one way leaving yourself the position that works best for you. (linking your stones or building a wall to play away from yourself)

Also learn a little about good shape, it just makes it easier for you to make eyes and that is never bad.
