;B[pc];W[dp];B[op];W[dd];B[fq]C[EE: A natural kakari,  since Black is emphasising the lower side with his 5-4-stone.]
;W[hq];B[fo]C[EE: I like this move!  It uses the influence from the bottom  right corner.]
;W[dn];B[ip]L[jq]C[EE: This is consistent with  the central ambition of the takamoku and can't be wrong. I might consider 'a'  myself, which is considered in some situations to be an overplay , but with  Black's backup on the right it is interesting to try for the strongest  possible attack.]
;W[iq]L[eq][fr]C[EE: It is joseki for White to first  exchange 'a' for 'b'.]
;B[jp];W[jq]L[hp]C[EE: Wa, to create  cutting aji, is normal.];B[hp]
C[EE: This looks good; Black  immediately takes the point White neglected to play and gets a strong shape  here.]
;W[kp]
(;B[dr]C[EE: This is the wrong direction. Black  must play as in the variation, IMHO.]
;W[cq];B[jm]L[lq][kq]C[NM: I should have taken J7 not K7 ... (or should I have taken M3 first?)

EE: No! Still there is an opportunity to play like in the variation for move  #15.  M3 (a) is, by the way, a clear case of aji-keshi (loss of potential).]
;W[mq];B[ko]L[lp]M[mq]C[EE: Still not a bad point (although  the clamp of 'a' also looks interesting) but with the marked stone in place,  not nearly as effective as earlier.]
;W[lp];B[qq]L[nr]C[EE:  Hmmm... how about Ba?];W[oq];B[pq];W[np];B[oo]
;W[no]
(;B[om]C[EE: Since White's next move is a bit annoying,  Black might try to play as in the variation.]
;W[qk];B[qh];W[qn];B[qo]L[or][nq][nr]C[EE: If Black wants to play here, he  should probably first exchange 'a' for 'b' - that would be the right time to  do so. "Force before defending." If White tenukis or plays ko (c), then Black  can chose to dispense of protecting his shape. And if White answers, Black  got 'a' in sente.]
;W[rn];B[pn];W[ro];B[rp];W[fm]L[qm][rm][ql][rl][rj][rk]C[EE: White abandons his right side group,  which is still quite weak (imagine a-f for example). Black could attack it  directly, but since there may be other ways to attack it, leaving it for a  while, as Black does, is probably okay.]
;B[cf]C[NM: Should this have  been C10?

EE: C14 is ok, I think. C11 looks better than C10 to me since C11 leaves room  for a full two-point extension in either direction.]
;W[ch];B[ef]L[dh][ci][di]C[EE: Another idea is to play tsuke (a) to flatten out  his position. If he pulls back (b) then you jump (the played stone). If he  instead plays hane (c) you can pull back or extend, and aim at the cutting  point (b) later.]
;W[fd];B[di]L[eh]C[EE: This could turn out to  be an overplay, due to the White influence below, which supports White here,  should a fight arise. 'a' would be safer.]
;W[ci]L[dh][eh][ei]C[EE:  White could pick a fight with Wa-Bb-Wc; hard to tell what happens thereafter.]
;B[dj];W[dg]M[cq][di][dj]L[df]C[NM: What should I have done  here?
(bearing in mind that I was trying to keep the D6 group weak)

EE: The D6 group has san-san after all, so it isn't very weak. Connecting at  'a' seems to be the natural answer. The marked Black stones could be regarded  as kikashi (therefore dispendable) since White answered D11 submissively on  the third line.]
;B[dh]C[EE: This feels crude, pushing your opponent  against your own weak pair of stones.]
;W[eg];B[cj]C[NM: If W  had gone C13 I was  ready to abandon C14 and E14, maybe by playing B E6, W E7, B D7; would  that have been sensible?

EE: See var! As for #47, since White didn't connect at c13, it feels very  tempting to cut there.]

(;W[df];B[cg];W[bj];B[cd];W[cc];B[de];W[ee];B[ce];W[ff];B[dc];W[ed];B[bc]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[db]
(;B[bi]C[EE: Dubious, since it helps White to eye shape and if White lives,  Black's L-shaped group is cut off.]

(;W[bk];B[bh];W[jd]C[EE: This is too narrow an extension, since White is so thick to the left.]
;B[ld]L[lc]C[EE: It is maybe mostly matter of taste, but personally, I  would play this low, on 'a', because the center isn't so important when so  many strong groups of both colours have access to it. 'a' is stronger  territorially and aims at sliding into and destroying White's upper left.]
;W[kc]L[lc]C[EE: A bit strange. 'a' is normal, but since White next  invades upper right he shouldn't strengthen Black here, so better not play  here at all, in my opinion.]
;B[lc];W[qe]C[EE: With the White group  below still weak, this can easily become an overplay. Black should aim at a  double attack on those two groups.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[pd];B[qc];W[pe]M[qh]C[EE: Now Black has to consider  that White has two weak groups on the board and devise a double attack  strategy. The high-level plan is to chase one of the groups against R12  (marked) and when Black then plays to strengthen R12, White will have to  chose on which side to play.  The other side will suffer.

This is a high level strategy, and it might be difficult to implement the  details of the plan, but it could prove very successful if it succeeds. See  "Attack and Defence" and "Kato's Attack and Kill" for good examples of this  technique!

See the variation for a sample sequence of how a successful attack could look  like.]

(;B[rf]C[EE: I'm not sure about this move - it makes White as  heavy as possible (if he answers, which I'm not sure he should), but Black  loses the big yose of S15 and the corner is weakened (see var to move #80).]
;W[re];B[og];W[nf]C[EE: White isn't properly connected,  but cutting fails because the corner is weak.]

(;B[nd];W[od];B[oc];W[ne];B[of];W[md];B[nc];W[oe];B[me]L[lf]C[NM: Was N15 necessary?

EE: No, it seems to just help White out. M14 (a) looks more active.];W[mf]
;B[le];W[mh]C[EE: Now White is out in the clear and  Black's four stones are so weak that he has to forget the attack of White's  lower right group.]
;B[pj]C[EE: This defensive move seems correct.];W[pk];B[oj]C[NM: I thought O9 would be too dangerous

EE: Agree - it is your upper group that is weak. Below you are rock solid.]
;W[mj];B[ok]C[NM: Or S10?

EE: S10 puts some pressure on the White group, but there is a risk that  Black's own group gets cut off and becomes threatened. It is hard to read out  what happens. Better save such moves for situations where there is no other  way to try for a win.]
;W[qj];B[je];W[id];B[kh]C[NM:  Or should I have gone N8?

EE: When you ask yourself the question: "From which side should I attack  now?" and don't find an answer you feel for, it is often a good idea to drop  the attack for a while. Later developments may make it clear which side is  the best for attack. Here, it looks unlikely to kill the White group, and  hard to make much profit out of attacking it further, so why don't you just  take some big endgame points instead?]
;W[ml]
(;B[nn];W[mn]L[mm][nl][ol][nm]C[NM: Here I'm sure I should have  gone on to cut at N7

EE: The threat to cut would give White at least a ko for connection (a-d).  For a way to cut, see the variation for the previous move.]
;B[nh];W[ni]C[
 Niall 9k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[li]L[oh]C[EE: Don't expect White to connect here - he might play  'a'!]
;W[mi];B[qi];W[ri];B[mm];W[lm];B[nm];W[ll];B[ln];W[oh]C[NM: Here should I have answered  (as in variation)?

EE: No, see the squeeze variation!]
(;B[ph];W[ng];B[mo]L[cr]C[EE: This seems too passive - remember "force before defending". If you  are anxious about your bottom left group, you could play 'a', a good yose  move. It increases your eye space, and if White wants to attack your group,  he has to answer in the corner. This way, you can make 'a' more sente for  you, or if he doesn't answer, dispense with the small connection.]
;W[pg];B[rh];W[sj];B[cr];W[br];B[cm]C[NM: Was this the right  attacking point?

EE: Yes, looks good enough - no need to try for more.

Counting secure points, it is about even, but Black is thicker, and has more  presence in the center, so he should be able to pick up the few extra points  for victory.]

 rain6 9k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[bn];B[or];W[nq];B[qf];W[pf];B[hf]L[lb]C[EE: I think the sagari of 'a' should take precedence, since it  is very close to being double sente.]
;W[kb];B[bl]C[NM: B8 was a  mouse-o, but apparently my request to undo it never got through... Still, it  wasn't such a bad play after all...

EE: It is about 10 points in gote.];W[lb];B[mb];W[gq];B[gp];W[dq];B[fr]

;W[ms];B[mr]C[NM: W should have  played Q1...];W[lr];B[qr];W[ms];B[bs]C
[EE: No use  fighting the ko, since you cannot win it (White just plays L1). Q1 is around  18 (!) points, so you should play it at once.]
