 wms 23k*: *bow* Me too. :)];W[cd];B[od];W[pj];B[qm];W[pf]C[rich: I thought  this was an overplay by w, leaving hole at q12.  I decided to let it remain
as a potential invasion and move elsewhere.  Was that correct?];B[jq];W
[ec];B[dj];W[rf];B[rd]C[rich: I was afraid that I would lose the corner, but  this means I let w settle himself
in sente.];W[dm];B[dg];W[nf];B[md]L[hc]C[rich: maybe something around a would be  better?]
;W[jc];B[le]C[rich: seems this move is too slow.  It is not  attacking anything or accomplishing much
and just provokes k15.];W[je];B[lf]C[rich: I just don't know *what* I thought  I was doing :(  g3 (or f3?) look big here.]
;W[ff];B[fh];W[ig];B[nj]C[
 rich 25k : yuch! I don't like my shape :(];W[oh];B[nl];W[mh];B[lj];W[kh]
;B[jj]C[rich: I thought that exchange helped me a lot!  Starts to surround a  huge moyo.]
;W[hi];B[hk];W[mq];B[gq];W[er];B[np];W[lp];B[jo];W[jm];B[hm];W[nq];B[op]

[rich: I wanted to reduce w's corner, but now I wish my marked stones were  on the

third line.  All I end up doing here is firming up w's territory that he had  already
mapped out.];W[bm];B[cl];W[cm];B[fm]C[rich: not very big.  maybe pushing up  around s10 or b14 would be bigger?]
;W[js];B[is];W[ks];B[hr]C[rich: I didn't  understand that exchange by w.  Seems to remove all aji there and settle
my stones.  w looked safe to me.];W[ko];B[lo];W[jp];B[kp]C[rich: fighting  this ko really hurt me since I let w take several big points for

very little gain myself.  I think this ko fight is where I lost the game by  letting
w map out more territory than me.];W[pl];B[pm];W[ko];B[or];W[nr];B[kp];W
[bg];B[ip];W[ch];B[cf];W[bf];B[ce];W[be];B[dh];W[ci];B[cj]C[rich: another small  move.  I could have taken a lot of points on right side here.]
;W[rk]C[

 rich 25k : this seems like a key juncture of the game, but I'm not sure what  to
      do];B[hc]C[rich: basically by this point I decided I was losing  (especially since w gets 8 pts komi),

and I was looking for a way to steal some of w's territory.  The problem is  it all looks
pretty solid to me.  What would you suggest here?];W[ei];B[di];W[fi];B[eh]
;W[gh];B[gj];W[gi];B[ek];W[de];B[kd];W[jd];B[jb];W[kb];B[kc];W[ib];B[lb]
;W[ja];B[eo];W[do];B[en];W[qs];B[rr];W[rs];B[rq];W[kf];B[cc]C[rich: I really  didn't have specific plans here except that it seemed like a likely

point to attack.  If w plays b16 I was considering d16, but that doesn't look  so
good to me now.];W[dd];B[bc];W[bj];B[bk];W[ai];B[bd];W[rm];B[rn];W[sm]C
[rich:  w really gives me a break here and makes a gote play allowing me to keep  attacking him!]
;B[bh]C[rich: I didn't read this out, it just seemed like a  vital point, and actually w lives
easily];W[ah];B[ab];W[ba]C[
 wms 23k*: Ugh.  This is getting tricky...];B[db]L[eb][ad]C[rich: I thought this would  make a and b miai...]
;W[eb]C[rich: except when he played e18 I  realized that I would die if I played a16 and gave
w d19!];B[ca]L[ad][bb]C[rich: but this time c19 does seem to make a and b miai for  life.]
;W[bb];B[ad];W[ae];B[fr];W[es];B[cq]C[rich: it worked once, so  why not try again :)]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[cr];B[br];W[ds];B[cn];W[dn];B[cp];W[bs];B[bn];W[am]C[rich: well I give up.  I can't find a variation that gives b  life.]
;B[aq]C[rich: a losing move];W[bo];B[co];W[an];B[bp];W[ao];B[as];W[ap]C
[
 rich 25k : that one failed :)
 wms 23k*: Yeah but you got a lot off of the other one...
 wms 23k*: I'll be pondering how you did that for days.];B[oi];W[pi]C[At this  point you should make only guaranteed sente moves, because you must defend at  F1 or F3 or F4. (That's how to use your first gote move.)]
;B[nh]C[153 loses  you the sente.];W[ng];B[ni];W[oe];B[ne];W[pe];B[pd];W
[ol];B[om];W[nm];B[nk];W[ql];B[mp];W[qn];B[pn];W[on];B[qo];W[lq];B[li];W
[lh]C[You have reagained  the sente and are doing well here.];B[ji];W[jh]
;B[ii]C[He can safely ignore  175 and take the sente.];W[fs];B[gs]C[Better to defend at F3 or F4.  This  winds up losing you about 12 points.  This, along with the loss of the upper  left corner later, is what lost you the game.]
;W[fq];B[fp];W[gr];B[hq];W[hs];B[ef]C[This is a good sente move, it should have been done earlier.  The  basic idea is, when you get sente in the early end game, make all the sente  moves you can find, and then use the first gote move to take away one of his  sente moves.  Gote moves that don't take away sente are done when there is  nothing else left.]
;W[ee];B[fe];W[fd];B[fg];W[gf];B[gg];W[hg];B[ea]C[Better  do nothing here until he attacks, then C18.]
;W[fa];B[da]C[rich: what an  idiot!!!  I saw the lack of liberties earlier but by this time I had forgot

all about it :(  All I need to do to live is play at c18 instead.  Here, You  spotted your own mistake.]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[ac]C[
 rich 25k : well, I screwed that up :(
 wms 23k*: Yeah.  I saw that a while back and hoped you didn't... :)
 rich 25k : I saw it a while back and didn't remember it :(

 wms 23k*: When you played E19 I got all excited.  You may have noticed I  starte
     d moving real fast.
 rich 25k : I'm counting now ot see whether to resign...
 wms 23k*: I don't think you have to.  L8 looks pretty big to me.];B[re]
C[rich: when I counted I thought I was down by 20 or 30, but I decided to  keep trying in

case I counted wrong :)  The problem is all white's territory looks solid to  me, so
perhaps the correct play here would be to resign.];W[qe]C[

 rich 25k : well, I'm no good at counting so I'll play for a while at  least...]
;B[fj]C[

 wms 23k*: OK.  That's fine with me...I'm enjoying the game.  Plus it still  look
     s kinda close to me.];W[ir]C[You need upper left, + area around F3 to  have won.

( rich 25k : damn, I think I would have won with upper left corner :()   (Or maybe a good series of sente moves might have made up for the F3 area.]
;B[iq]C[
 wms 23k*: It does look that close.  You lost 26 points there I figure.]
;W[is]C[
 rich 25k : yea, so 26 points in a close game makes a big difference!];B
[el]C[You had a sente move at T14.];W[dl];B[dk];W[la]C[White 204 was  the start  of a series of sente moves by white that gained him several points.]
;B[mb];W[ma];B[na];W[ka];B[nb];W[sn];B[so];W[ak]C[White goes astray here, since  this is gote.  If he couldn't find a sente move, he should have blocked one  of yours, such as T14.]
;B[mg];W[lg];B[mf]C[White's next move at T14 blocks  your sente move, but it is a mistake that costs him 8 points!]
;W[sf]C[rich:  un unfortunate mistake by Bill, but does not give me too many points anyway]
;B[og]C[
 wms 23k*: Oops.  :(];W[ph];B[of];W[pg]C[
 rich 25k : I think big 8pt komi in GOE rules may come to haunt me

[now that I decided to keep going I was starting to convince myself it was  closer than
it really was :) \]
 wms 23k*: Yes.  I'm glad to have it...may need it this game.
 wms 23k*: Last T game I was Black and lost by >>>ONE<<< point!];B[hj]C
[J12  would get  you one point in sente.
 rich 25k : ouch! so you would have won with normal komi];W[ok]C[
 wms 23k*: Yes.  Check my results...it's the game against zoro.];B[ej];W

 wms 23k*: Yup.  I don't think that it will decide the game, though...
