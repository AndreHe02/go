This game shows off weaknesses for both players. The opening was pretty ugly for me (white), and I felt my position was weak until I won the ko battle, at which point the game swiftly turned in my favor. Comments on the following would be very helpful:
-Reacting to different openings
-Invasions (both corner and side)
-Running
-Tenuki

Thanks in advance for your help!
Peter (White)

[Ghost\]
This is the reviewer. I will comment this game from white's point of vue.
Indeed white made many mistakes in the fuseki, so a little study there might be beneficial (see gobase.org and kombilo). Actually you lost the ko fight, but your opponent made some mistakes later. It was a strange game to comment due to black moves. A lot of those were excellent considering his level but a few rare mistakes ruined his game. White showed good fighting spirit. Perhaps a little too much :o)
One must keep in mind that in go, particularly when you're playing someone nearly on the same level, you won't be able to invade all your opponent territory, kill his groups, live inside his corner and make big moyos.... Trying to do this will only create a lot of weaknesses
One of white' main problem though may be the life and death status of the groups on the board (a common weakness). Nearly every group white used to invade were killable. These groups have to get out very early in the game. Once you are sealed in and have to work at connecting or getting eyes, it's too late... Also, you do not have to fear the opponents moyo, as long as you have a bigger one yourself :o))

 Ghost];B[dp];W[qd];B[cd];W[pq];B[fc]LB[cc:a][ec:b]C[[Ghost\]
This large corner shimari is not usually played, because of a weakness at 'a'. The usual corner enclosure is played at 'b']
;W[po]LB[jq:a][cj:b]C[[Tartuffe\]
Thanks to the corner enclosure both k4 and q10 seem huge, but B has a beautiful d10. Would it be better to prevent c/d10?

[Ghost\]
The corner enclosure you chose (that is the one point jump) stresses influence along the side it faces. Therefore k3 (rather than k4) is big. q10 is in the wrong direction of play, and is not a big point yet. It may also be noted that the corner white just played in is still open to an invasion. The biggest points on the board now are 'a' (k3) and 'b' (c10). Therefore white playing seems a little tame : it offers two beautifull plays to black. Instead of White 6 at q5, I would have prefered to play at 'b', robbing black of the biggest point on the board. So, indeed 'b' was better. In the beginning, Black has sente, so white has to play actively, this corner enclosure, while not a bad move, is too passive]
;B[cj]TR[fc][dp]C[[Tartuffe\] 
Would this be better at d10? It's a powerful move, and I think it would grab more influence over the center. It also might work better with the d4 stone?

[Ghost\]
It is fine as it is. Since both the lower star point stone, and Black's top corner enclosure (marked also) are high, it is more balanced to play at c10 rather than d10.]

(;W[dg]LB[fq:a][cg:b]C[[Tartuffe\]

At this point the prospect of a huge black left side worried me. Would it have been better to continue at k4 or k16? Enclose the corner? Approach the c10 stone at e10? Approach the d4 stone at c6? f3 doesn't look good to me; black would be delighted to take d6.

[Ghost\]

It is a difficult question to answer. It depends on the way you want to play the game. The first way is to immdiately try to reduce black top potential moyo. The second way is to make one of your own (keep in mind that black's top left corner is still open). Since your own (the marked stones) corner enclosure stresses side influence,  I find it sensible to use it by playing 'a' (see variation). Sure, black gets territory, but white gets a big moyo. k4 and k16 are too high, but k3 is way too passive and k17 is in the wrong direction of play.
Since you apparently chose to reduce, white 8 is a bad move, you're only going to reinforce black. If you want to reduce the top left, I think now is the time to use the weakness of the corner enclosure by playing 'b'. Black takes risks in attacking this stone too hard since he is weak in the corner, so white can get out, also black cannot make any good extension to attack this stone.]
;B[ej]C[[Tartuffe\]
This seems like a great move to me.

[Ghost\]
I agree, this is good.(Keep in mind that since white plays high, black can always connect both his groups with B13.]
;W[cn]LB[fg:a][dd:b][ol:c]C[[Tartuffe\]

Not quite sure how to react to a solid move I approached the lower corner. Should I have run instead? It seemed like letting B chase W would lead to a gigantic moyo in the lower left and possibly the top.

[Ghost\]

This is a mistake. Black just attacked a stone you used to invade a potentially too big territory.. It *is* important. By making another approach, you created two weak groups for yourself, cut off from each other, already under heavy attack. Getting out with 'a' is crucial, another move later to make good shape and make use of black weaknesses is 'b'. One of the go rules is that you can't possibly attack on both sides at the same time.]
;B[en]C[[Tartuffe\]

Ouch... this blocks me pretty well. I wasn't ready to dive into the corner, but now I have to consider the prospect of a large black territory along the bottom if black grabs k4.

[Ghost\]

True, the approach at C6 was too low, so black can seal white in, and force white to live small while black builds some influence, that reduces the effect of white's corner enclosure]
;W[dk]TR[dg]LB[cq:a][fq:b]CR[po][pq]C[[Tartuffe\]

I peeped here to make a little space. I didn't have room for a normal extension, and I hoped that a play on the 4th line could help me run into the center if things fell apart. Would this have been better at b4? c9? b9? d8? I felt a little lost here.

[Ghost\]

This does not make good shape, but makes black stronger, and weakens white marked stone. I think a double attack on the corner at 'b' makes full use of white strength in the circle marked stones, and leaves the threat of 'a' for later. It doesn't reinforce black, and strengthens white's bottom]
;B[dj]SQ[cj][ej]C[[Tartuffe\]

A very fast response. Perhaps e9 would have been better? My stones seem so weak that it would not take much to kill them. My only hesitation with e9 is the upper left white stone.

[Ghost\]

This is the wrong direction anyway, either this move or e9. In a fight, you definitely not run in the direction where the opponent is the strongest (that would be the marked stones). The rule is to push the enemy toward your walls (if you attack) and if you have weak stones, to play from them (That is why E6 was good : it was both offensive and defensive).]
;W[ck]C[[Tartuffe\]

Trying to create room for eye space.

[Ghost\]

Of course, creating room for eyespace by move 14 is not a good sign... Assuming you succed, you'll only have a group that will live small, probably in gote, while Black will build tremendous influence.]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[bk]
(;W[bl]LB[cm:a][bl:b][em:c]C[[Tartuffe\]

I had to think about this move for a while, and I'm still not happy about my response. What would be the best play here? I know I'm hurting, but it seems too early to jump out to f8.

[Ghost\]

I would have played white 'a', black 'b', white 'c', see variation]
;B[cm];W[bj]LB[bm:a][ak:b][dm:c]C[[Tartuffe\]
Better at b7? (... B d7 W b10 or W f8) I just didn't want to reduce the liberties of the d9 group. How safe are these stones? The invasion seems fairly weak, and B should profit on the bottom and upper left.

[Ghost\]

The important thing is not to get sealed in. White's move is small. A good black response would be black 'a', white 'b', black 'c'. When you get sealed in you have to worry about life. Personnaly, I would have played as in variation, beginning with white 'a']
;B[bm];W[ak];B[dm];W[el]LB[fk:a][bh:b][ch:c]C[[Tartuffe\]

Better at c11? I missed this move during the game.At the time I didn't want a big black center. Also, the "run before life" idea was running through my head.

[Ghost\]

This doesn't get out. playing 'a' was better to get out. in order to connect both groups, 'b' is the correct move, playing c11 is a mistake, because of black 'c'. I think get out first, then connect]
;B[gk];W[fm]LB[gl:a][em:b][dn:c]C[[Tartuffe\]

Again, it seems like I'd be better off at c11.

[Ghost\]
'a' was stronger, since white can play 'b' in sente (black has to connect at 'c']
;B[bi]C[[Tartuffe\]
The door slams shut.];W[bn]LB[fq:a][fp:b][gp:c]C[[Tartuffe\]

The big black corner still had me worried. Perhaps just invade at c3 rather than connect to a very weak group?

[Ghost\]

This can't live...
You can't paradrop a few stones in an area where the opponent is stronger than you and both have living groups and destroy his territory.
You seem a lot worried by your opponent territory, how about you make some for yourself ? 
White 'a', black 'b' white 'c' is powerfull !];B[am]LB[fn:a]
[fm:b]C[[Tartuffe\]

More escape paths are closing... right now I wanted both to run and to invade the corner... is the best running point h7? g6?

[Ghost\]
This is very dangerous for white since it both cut you off, and destroyed your eyes, now your white groups has no eyes at all.
You have to make choices.... You can't do everything at the same time. Running, living, invading... not possible.I think sealing black in with simply 'a' was good, but the problems you have are due to the fact that 'b' was too slow]
;W[cq]LB[gn:a]C[[Tartuffe\]

Instead I invade the corner. Life should be no problem, but now I'm worried about black on the bottom and a destination for my weak side group.

[Ghost\]

Actually life is a problem, as things are, white is dead in the corner except for black's mistakes. A black move at 'a' kills the other white group !]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[bp]C[[Ghost\]

Black 'a' is a tesuji];B[fp];W[er]C[[Tartuffe\]

This loses sente and makes decent shape for black. Did I need to do these two moves?

[Ghost\]

Yes];B[fr];W[ds];B[gq]TR[hl][hm][hn][gn]C[[Tartuffe\]

This seems to be a waste. If I were black, I would have played around k4 (keeping pressure on the weak white group and grabbing nice influence/territory).

[Ghost\]

k4 is not good. M3 is better. But still, any move near the marks is enough to kill white.]
;W[jq]LB[hm:a][lq:b][qk:c][oc:d]C[[Tartuffe\]

Because of my thoughts about k4, I took k3. This is another tenuki, and I feel that it should have lost me the game. A black move at h7 would destroy me.

[Ghost\]

Of course. 'a' was crucial (many moves ago in fact). K3 is a mistake anyway. White seems to have a fascination with the middle line (k line and line 10). k3 is too close to black. 'b' is better. another enclosure at 'c' and extending at 'd' are also good moves. Getting out with 'e' is also important. This number of really important moves reveal the weaknesses of white's position.]
;B[hm]C[[Ghost\]

Good move for black, although it should have been played as soon as move 30 (white's 3-3 invasion)]
;W[gn]C[[Tartuffe\]

Desperation...];B[hn];W[ai]C[[Tartuffe\]

desperation... waste of a move];B[bh];W[io]C[[Tartuffe\]

I thought, if I cannot save this group, I'll use it to build up my bottom territory. As I look at it now, though, it doesn't threaten to connect. Is this a good move? What would be better? I was trying to keep it urgent so black would not play q10 or k16.

[Ghost\]

This white group is totally cut off. It cannot be used to build anything. And you still have this strange fascination with middle points (perhaps a handicap game deformation ?) (q10 and k16) they are not the biggest points anymore... I specified the biggest a few moves ago, they did not change]
;B[go]LB[qp:a][kn:b]C[[Tartuffe\]

Black bites at the bait.

[Ghost\]

True, tenuki and using the weakness at 'a' was stronger.];W[kn]
LB[gg:a][oc:b][qk:c][cc:d]C[[Tartuffe\]

Grabbing territory and extending into the center. k7 seemed too greedy.

[Ghost\]

This is too small
'a' is the biggest point.
'b', 'c' and 'd' are also big];B[ir]C[[Tartuffe\]

This seemed weak. After this series of moves I had sente to complete a corner. This let me back into the game, it seemed.

[Ghost\]

True, Black did not make many mistakes up until here, but the last 3 moves were mistakes.]
;W[jr];B[iq];W[ip];B[hp];W[oc]LB[qj:a][qp:b]C[[Tartuffe\]

The right place? I was also considering a move to save my horribly weak d13 stone. Now q10 is gigantic.

[Ghost\]

Getting your stone out was bigger.
Q10 is a mistake, the big point now is 'a' (with the peep at 'b' as a combination for black). Any approach on a black move at 'a' results in a 2 point extension for black]
;B[qj]C[[Ghost\]

Black doesn't miss it. The way black plays is strange...Sometimes he sees all the big points, at the right timing, finds the good way to seal in or kill, and then (like 4/5 moves ago) makes a series of useless moves.]
;W[ql]LB[qp:a][pp:b][qn:c]C[[Tartuffe\]

Is this the right response? It gives me a huge corner and keeps black out of the bottom area, but black settles nicely. It looks like miai, so would k16 be better and then follow black's move around here?

[Ghost\]

This is the right move. Because of the directions of both black and white top corner enclosures, a move at K17 (NOT K16) is small.

But this does not "give" you the corner. A peep at 'a' followed by white 'b'  black 'c' destroys everything. Do not be overconfident : the enclosure you chose does not favour territory. (same can be said for the top left black corner where an invasion is still possible)]
;B[qg];W[jd]LB[gg:a][og:b][oj:c]C[[Tartuffe\]

I was very happy to get this point. Should I have hassled black first? Perhaps p9, q14 to guide his movement out from his base, or a direct q12? At this point I still feel very much behind, so I want to play aggressively.

This sort of position (two enemy stones on "my side") appears frequently during games, so any comments on how to handle it would be great.

[Ghost\]
This wasn't big. Getting out your stone with 'a' was bigger. I think you try too much too recreate handicap game positions.

The classic way of attacking the two stones is to "cap" one of them with a move at 'b' or 'c' depending of your direction of play. Considering the situation, 'c' is the best move (after 'a' of course)]
;B[he]C[[Ghost\]

Another good move for black];W[gd]TR[jd]LB[hg:a]C[[Tartuffe\]
I hate it when people do this to me, so I decided to give it a try. It might be too aggressive, but I was very far behind in points. Here is my reasoning: if black strains to keep me away from the lone d13 stone, I can cut off f17 or maybe h15. If he tries to cut this move off from k16, I will attack the corner and try to separate his h15 stone from the corner.

[Ghost\]
This is weak, and leaves you with defaults in your position, and weakens the marked stone. 'a' was good to reduce territory. In order to successfully use the kind of move you just played you need a little preparation first.]
;B[hd];W[gc]C[[Tartuffe\]

Keeping his stones separated.

[Ghost\]

No, he keeps YOUR stones separated.];B[hc];W[gb];B[fd]C[[Ghost\]
This is black mistake.];W[dc]LB[gg:a]C[[Tartuffe\]
I take a break to dive into the corner. Does this work? I thought that if he went after my g stones I would certainly live. If he went after the d17 stone he would have to worry about the g stones running to safety and destroying his territory.

[Ghost\]
It doesn't work if your opponent makes no mistake, and sooner or later they will not :o) 'a' was still good.]
;B[dd];W[cc];B[fb]C[[Tartuffe\]
Better at g15? That would make him much more solid. Right now I consider him far enough ahead to allow a small life in the corner.

[Ghost\]
No this is the correct response. Never try to live small ! It should be your last resort. You are behind, true, but you give black all the opportunities to make territory in the center.]
;W[eb]C[[Tartuffe\]
I'm happy both to make my corner safer and to threaten to connect.

[Ghost\]
White's "corner" is not safer. It is still dead.];B[fa];W[ge]
;B[fe]C[[Tartuffe\]

Better at h14?

[Ghost\]

Yes, black is connected already, H14 was necessary in order not to have a too tedious fight. This mistake will cost black very much in the following fight.]
;W[gf];B[ff];W[gg];B[fg];W[bd]LB[bb:a]C[[Tartuffe\]

The line of g stones felt safe enough for time being to complete the corner. Is this an acceptable tenuki?

[Ghost\]
 White is still dead, if black plays 'a', the vital point.]
;B[be];W[bb];B[ad];W[bc]C[[Ghost\]
This is a mistake. Launching a ko fight with 'a' for tlife and death of the group is correct. Now the white group is dead (though black misses his kill)]
;B[da];W[ea];B[ba];W[ac];B[aa];W[db];B[ca];W[cb];B[ec];W[ab]
LB[if:a]C[[Tartuffe\]
With 4 corners I felt that I had a chance if I made some big plays.

[Ghost\]
You are ahead by quite a lot actually now. Killing black with 'a' is the strongest move]
;B[if]LB[je:a]C[[Tartuffe\]
I lost sente, though. :(

[Ghost\]

Black saw the threat, but to get out, 'a' was better];W[ih]
LB[hh:a]TR[gb][gc][gd][ge][gf][gg]C[[Tartuffe\]
I don't want black getting any ideas about connecting to his solid lower group. However, this is not a secure connection for me, making me worry about a cut. Is this a safe running/containing move? Right now I'm also getting worried about a black move at m16 or thereabouts.

[Ghost\]
This could be a game loosing mistake.... Considering a black play at 'a' kills the marked stones due to a shortage of liberties.]
;B[jg]LB[hh:a][kf:b]C[[Tartuffe\]
To me, this certainly would have been better at k14. A solid connection, but too slow.

[Ghost\]

k14 is much too slow. killing white at 'a' or getting out with 'b' is stronger]
;W[jh];B[kg];W[le]TR[hc][hd][jb]LB[hj:a][hh:b][kh:c]C[[Tartuffe\]
Guiding his path and making territory. Also helps against a surprise move in my area.

[Ghost\]
Because of the marked stones low position, and the possibility of a monkey jump, white has no real territory at the top.'a' was safer since it protects from the cut at 'b'. As it stands,  a move at 'c'  now still kills white]
;B[kh];W[jj]LB[hh:a]C[[Tartuffe\]
A correct distance?

[Ghost\]
Yes but should have been played earlier, black can kill. Also the cut at 'a' is still possible (striking through a knights move tesuji)]
;B[jl];W[gh]LB[ki:a][mh:b][lk:c]C[[Tartuffe\]
Finally covering the cut. At this point should I be looking for eyespace? A black move around l9 would make things tough.

[Ghost\]
You were aware of it ?
Eyespace is definitely not the time. The get out sequence of white 'a' black 'b' white 'c' is correct. Of course, black has sente...

But misses the point.];B[fh]LB[kj:a]C[[Tartuffe\]
This seems like a bad move. I would have played l9, m8, or l11.

[Ghost\]
Indeed, 'a' kills white];W[ki]C[[Tartuffe\]
I'm making a break for the lower right while pressuring his stones in my territory. Should I be going for the kill or just a beneficial direction?

[Ghost\]
Considering your situation going for the kill is a little bit over the top. Making life would be really nice... Black has a strong position, it will be almost impossible to kill if not for some mistakes.]
;B[mh]LB[li:a]C[[Tartuffe\]

Slow?

[Ghost\]

Good move ! 'a' doesn't work because the ladder favours white.]
;W[nf]LB[lj:a]C[[Tartuffe\]
Taking territory. In hindsight, would o13 or p14 have been better? I like the strength of the knights jumps.

[Ghost\]
You have to decide... You want too much.
You want territory, life for your group and to kill black... a little bit much. Don't run two hares at the same time.
Also, the knights jumps are not really strong since they can be cut. Black 'a' kills white. The following moves reflect this... and at the end of the race to the right of the board, you center white dragon is in trouble... but the trouble started many moves ago.]
;B[ng];W[og];B[oh]C[[Tartuffe\]
He seems pretty well connected. I now think about the safety of my running group.]
;W[pg];B[ph];W[qf];B[rf];W[qe];B[rg];W[li]C[[Tartuffe\]
I thought this move was threatening. Is that right?

[Ghost\]
It threatens nothing. Black can still kill.];B[lk]C[[Tartuffe\]
Black didn't think so...

[Ghost\]

Black is right.];W[mg];B[lh];W[nh];B[ni]LB[mi:a]C[[Ghost\] 

Black should have played at 'a' : black would be connected and white would be dead.]
;W[mi]TR[gb][gc][gd][ge][gf][gg][gh][ih][jh][jj][ki][li][mh]
[lh][kh][kg][jg][if][he][hd][hc]C[[Tartuffe\]
Creating the ko fight. I see big threats for me at d6 and perhaps h8 (assuming I could capture the k8 stone). Black has more threats, but he really nees to win this battle.

[Ghost\]
Even D6 is too small a threat, and black has less threats.. Perhaps you do not realise what is at stake here. Simply the life or death of all the marked stones. And black takes the ko first...]
;B[ng];W[em];B[nh]C[[Tartuffe\]
Black should have fought a little... he could threaten both the left corners, or maybe my running group? Letting me bring the left side back to life seems to be a huge mistake. He saves 10 B stones, loses 5 Bstones, lets 11W stones live, breaks into some of my territory, and erases his lower left territory.

[Ghost\]
Since connecting the ko saves his stones and kills yours, this is the correct move (of course one must not make mistakes later.)]
;W[dn];B[fn];W[mj]LB[mk:a]C[[Tartuffe\]
Better to try to connect at h18? It seems like B couldn't stop W while W still has liberties.

[Ghost\]

H18 does not connect anything. A Black play at 'a' still kills white.]
;B[ol]C[[Ghost\]
This is an overplay and creates holes in black defences big enough to let white live. Before this move black won the game, now white is winning. The following fights of course enables white to connect and black resigns after a lot of dame points.
