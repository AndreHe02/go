C[hello maui, I will review for White... it is a rather calm game without big fights... I added some variations for you to consider... most of the time the given variation is only an example of what is possible, many other moves would be playable of course... guess that's the beauty of the game...

enjoy the review :)];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ep]
(;W[dn]C[this is a great reply! It aims directly at D15, which is the key point in this opening... you also have the option to play D15 right away, but I think your strategie with D6 first works nice.]
;B[cq];W[bq];B[dq];W[bo];B[iq]C[The high stone at D6 stands ideal, now it's time to strike at D15.]

(;W[de]C[Q: Is this approach good?

--

I would say it is the only move... you have the possibility to enlarge your influence further in sente with F5 and H4, but this joseki destroys the option of invading at G3 later. (see variation)]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[cd]
(;W[dg];B[fc];W[ck]TR[dn][bo]C[Q: Is this correct?  I played D13 instead of D14 with this move in mind.

--

this is bad, because the marked stones are clearly overconcentrated... to avoid this, I would play D14 and D10, if your opponent allows this... (see variation)]
;B[qn];W[nq];B[lq]
(;W[qo];B[pn];W[qk]C[Q: I played R5 with the intent of this kind of attacking move.  Maybe S4 instead of R5 better?  I would have sente  when B replies to S4 with R9, probably for an approach to R16.

--

what is the benefit of this attack? you don't attack because attacking is fun, but because you wanna gain something... be it territory or influence... but here I see no real gain from the attack...]

(;B[qg]C[this is luckwarm, black took it easy on you... I would play as far as R11... (see variation)]
;W[ol];B[nn];W[oo];B[on]
(;W[lp]C[Q: I think this move is bad for W.  Now I think N4 would have been better because it is connected to Q4 group better yet still separates Ws groups.

--

as I mentioned before, I still don't see what the goal of this attack is... what will be your benefit... if you attack from the bottom with N4, Black will run and get stronger... that way your two stones get weaker...

if you wanna try to split the groups, I think M3 is the way to go... if he answers at L3, you can continue from above... if he runs with his heavy stones right away, you can make profit with L3...]
;B[oj]C[say thank you to black :)
he helps you reinforce your weak stones, what a nice guy...]
;W[ok];B[mj]
(;W[pj];B[ml];W[oi];B[nj]
(;W[qh]C[Q: I tried to protect Q11 in sente.

--

seems ok to me... maybe P12 can be bothersome later, but you should be fine...]
;B[ph]C[with this blunt attack black destroys the P12 aji, you can be happy again...]

(;W[pg];B[oh];W[pi];B[nh];W[ni];B[rh];W[mi];B[lj];W[qi];B[pf]
;W[mh]C[oh... this is bad... you get nothing out of this move, but you force Black to take away the Q13 aji... the big endgame move at S13 is gone...]
;B[og]C[Now I am behind on points and never catch up.

--

I think the game is still open... White has sente and the O6 group is not save yet... you might get L3 in sente, because the heavy O6 group must try to escape afterwards, or you attack it from the center and build something there...

If you are confident you can play  L3 in sente, you should do this... if you're in doubt, you can still play at the top (I would suggest P17... or go for a grand scale moyo with K10... (see variations)]

(;W[md]C[I don't like this move... white can make too much profit answering at O17...]

(;B[di]C[this is clearly a bad move... the keyoint in this situation is C12, if black wants to do something in this area... I'm in doubt black can handle a secound weak group here, so D11 seems like an overplay to me... he should take care of O6 group first...]

I think both sides overestimated the value of the center... the top right corner has much more priority... the difference between black or white playing there first is so huge, a move in the center cannot be worth this difference...]

[es][fs][gs]C[you played a good opening, the game went on reasonable for a while... I think you lost the game during the attack on the center group, when black cut you of... to end it so close was only possible because Black played a terrible endgame...

I suggest you take a good look at my variations, especially in the middle game... try to grasp the ideas of how to use the weak groups of your opponent...

good luck and happy playing,
Bommel
