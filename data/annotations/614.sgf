C[For white 6, the most common move is (R,10).     The reason behind this is that all 3 black stones (1,3 and 5) are looking in this direction.]
;B[fq]C[RED: I assume that 7 is bad fuseki because of W's attachment at (F,4) and the fact that my 5 is low in the opposite corner...Is that right ?          No, it's not really bad but at least dubious.     I would not play here because of the low position of 5 and because I want to occupy myself a point around (R,10).]
;W[fp]C[White 8 is perhaps a good move but locally tobi at (D,6) or keima at (C,6) looks also equally good.

White should consider playing tenuki to play first on the right side
under the hoshi (R,10) or double pincer (R,14) or san-san (R,17).

Indeed, what is important in this bottom left corner is who is going to finish with sente and the only way to be sure of getting sente is to play tenuki right on.

The tsuke of white 8 could thus be analysed as an attempt to get sente and to make Black overconcentrated with his shimari.]

(;B[gp]C[For Black 9, hanekomi at (E,4) shoud be considered. The shicho is good for black so white will have to atari on top. The variation resulting shoud give Black sente, and points in the corner and would avoid him to end overconcentrated.      B(E,4) W(E,5) B(E,3) W(D,5) B(G,4) W(G,5) B(D,3) W(C,3) B(C,2) W(B,2) B(B,3) W(C,4) B(B,1) W(D,10).]
;W[fo]
(;B[go]C[This black move looks very strange to me.     You should first play (E,3) then it's good idea to play (G,5) to try to get sente. If white answers with hane, you'll play (J,3) and white must add a move.          So, you can first play tobi in (Q,14).White should extend in (K,16) so you get to play first the big point (Q,10).]
;W[eq]C[This 12 gives white good shape.];B[gn];W[gq];B[hq];W[fr]
C[For black now it looks very big to play 17 by decending at (H,2), otherwise     white will play here in sente and you will be left open at the bottom.          You shoud not play this move by giving atari at (G,2), because you will be left with weaknesses and with the burden of a ko fight with White (H,2).     On the contrary White shape is strong and he is not so affected.          You should also consider playing (J,4) which also guards the side and makes good shape.]
;B[fn];W[hr]C[As said, this move is very big and sente.];B[iq]
;W[ir]C[But this move 20, although sente, is a mistake.          The exchange of 20 for Black 21 is a loss for white at this stage of the game because it reinforces Black.          A black move at 20 although big would be absolute gote and     would not give black any follow up because the white group is so strong.          So this move should be considered white privilege, and white should postpone it till he doesn't mind reinforcing black.]
;B[jq];W[dn]
(;B[pj]C[That's the idea, but I don't like this move, I would prefer first to play tobi at (Q,14).         This tobi has hidden strengh in so that it threatens to attack at the top. So white should answer by extending at (L,16) and Black now answer at (Q,11).        If white answers the tobi by invading with (R,9) Black will start a double attack starting with kosumi-tsuke at (Q,17) and it will be ideal developpement for black.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[Black could also have answered White 24 by simply playing kosumi at (P,15). This would have lead to a clearcut and ideal developpement for Black but this 25 also looks like being ok.        Black looks like he is back in the game.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rd]C[White shoud simply play (Q,17), although big, the hane and connection reinforce Black moyo.        But I understand White feeling. He wants to take sente at any price so he needs to hane and connect to be alive in the corner.]
;B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od]C[Now white should connect at (O,18) and threaten to hane at (N,16) so Black should play (N,16) himself and White still has sente.]
;W[pm]C[RED: my 37 at ???     I don't seem to respond to this invasion very well.        You shoud play katatsuki (shouder-hit) at (P,8) and drive White toward your strength.        It looks like being very dangerous for white and even if you don't kill him you build new thickness and have a good follow up at the top by giving atari at (O,18).]
;B[nm];W[ok]LB[oj:b]C[RED: Instead of my 39 (O,11), just extending at (P,10) ?      Is my 39 too loose ?        Yes, but even if you play (P,10) White will resort to the well known tesuji of this shape, say W(O,8) B(N,8) W(O,9) and he is virtually out.        If he doesn't know the tesuji he will play W(O,9) and you will be pleased to give him bad shape by playing B(Q,9) W(P,8).]
;B[ni];W[mk];B[ll]C[That's not the direction.    You defend points and try to make territory with your thickness.    This game asks for pushing white toward thickness and making territory at the top.        So you should press white whith a keima at (M,10).]
;W[oj]C[White 42 looks like bad aji-keshi move.];B[oi];W[pk]
;B[qj];W[po];B[pp];W[nn]C[red: my 49 at (O,18)...Is this away from the point ?        No,your 49 is absolute sente so ...        But locally the normal move should be hane at (N,6).]
;B[nb];W[pa]C[RED: Instead of my 51 at (N,17)... I should come back to the fight going on at lower right ?        Yes]
;B[mc]C[49 was sente but 51 is gote.        White should immediately secure his group by catching Black move 37 by hane at (N,7).        This should reduce the number of points that Black can make in this area by a huge amount.]
;W[ln]C[Unnecessary stupid resistance, White should be happy to catch the 37(O,7) stone.        Now Black should connect his stone (N,7) and the fight goes on.]
;B[mo]C[Beeeep !    Bad Answer.    Try again.];W[mn];B[qo]C[You decided to let the white group live without any problem by taking territory for yourself but will you have enough points .        It's big to play on the top side you should try to make a big moyo here.]
;W[no]C[For White 56, I would play (N,8).        I think the exchange of Black 55 for White (N,8) makes white stronger.]
;B[mp]C[Black 57: if you continue to play here you are going to make the white group absolutely alive.]
;W[np]C[White 58: not necessary.];B[nq]C[Black 59: leaves bad aji so is better at (N,3).]
;W[jn]C[White 60: White really does not want to be absolutely alive. He should understand that he has nothing to attack here and that so he should play passively and not actively.            RED: 61 at (F,17) seemed like a pretty good extension...still I don't really understand.        Yes, playing a kakari at the top seems to be very big still ...    you don't understand why you lost the game ?        To know this,    let's review the rest of the game but you should remember that you are Black and that the komi is not with you but against you.]
;B[fc]C[Black 61 should be at (E,16).        Then if White plays tobi at (D,14) you play tobi in the center at (E,14).]
;W[df]C[For white 62, White shoudl take advantage of the low position of black 61 by playing keima at (F,15).        For example: W(F,15) B(H,16) W(H,15) B(J,15) W(H,14) B(J,16) W(J,14)...        White should also consider    attaching at (F,16), next I would cut at (G,17) planning to sacrifice this stone and make Black overconcentrated on the right, building strength and corner territory for myself.        For example: W(F,16) B(G,16) W(G,17) B(E,16) W (F,15) B(E,17) W(E,15) B(H,17) W(G,18) B(H,18) W(G,15) B(H,16) W(C,17) B(E,18) W (D,18) B(F,19) W(H,15)...]
;B[fe];W[lj];B[li];W[mi];B[mh];W[ki]C[For Black 69 perhaps you shoud only connect at (M,12).]
;B[mj];W[lk]C[For 70 White should consider connecting at (L,10) this will give him strength in the center to answer your hane at (L,12) which is sure to come next.]
;B[kh]C[For white 72 there seems to be only one move, nobi at (K,11).]
;W[eh]C[For white 73, there is a chance that if you atari at (K,11) and white tenuki, you will not be able to kill the white group so ...]
;B[cl]C[... invading at 73 looks good to me.        obviously this black invasion cannot be severely attacked, this makes white 72 a slack move.]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[em];B[ch];W[cf];B[dm];W[cn];B[en];W[el]LB[ek:b]
C[RED: 83 at (E,5) is wasted move... I should hit on top with (E,9) ???        Of course, your 83 is one of the stupidest move I have ever seen.        The only move is (E,9).    Not only it's the only move in this shape but it's the only move in this game.        If you play it, you will not lose this game whatever you play afterward.]
;B[eo]C[NO MORE COMMENT FOR THIS MOVE !];W[ek]C[TERRIBLE !]
;B[ep]C[You are really becoming crazy.        Do you expect your opponent to connect the two stones?        There is even the risk that white will ignore your move.        But even if white answer, what can you expect to gain from the exchange ?]
;W[cp];B[cj];W[bg];B[bh];W[bl];B[bk];W[dk]C[White 92, despite looking like a well timed kikashi that removes for sure one black eye is aji-keshi and damezumari.]
;B[ck];W[bm];B[ei];W[fi];B[cg];W[bf];B[fj]C[Eventually, thanks to the exchange of 92(D,9) for 93(C,9) Black manages to break through the center and save himself with this splendid tesuji.]

;B[dg];W[qk];B[rj];W[mq]C[This cut can be very dangerous now for black. He should simply give up two stones and give atari at (N,2).]
;B[lq];W[mr];B[lp];W[ls]C[Now black is in big trouble.];B[ks]
;W[kr];B[lr];W[js];B[fq];W[fp];B[jr]C[Black 143 is gote !!!    White should kill Black by playing 144 at (J,5).]

When you are black, if your opponent has 50 points on the board you need 56 to win the game. But if you are white and your opponent has 50 points on the board you need only 45.         That makes a big difference of 11 points. Our intuitive judgement of a game is very often biased by forgetting this mere evidence. That's one of the reasons why we amator players often lose with black.]
