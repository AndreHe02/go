AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Ott [9k\]: hi
KiraBox [12k\]: hello
Ott [9k\]: gg

stp: Hello KiraBox, I will make the review for you. Should you have any question do not hesitate to come back to me.]
;W[cd]C[KiraBox [12k\]: my connection has been iffy today, so I hope there are no problems
Ott [9k\]: i hope so
[KB\] - I'll mark my comments as such.];B[fc]C[[KB\] - I feel like this doesn't show confidence. Perhaps better at E16.

stp: At this stage, as long as it is a joseki move, there is no reason to prefere one joseki to the other. Choices of joseki need to be considered in light of the overall strategy you want to achieve... But it is likely that your level is not high enough to enable you such thoughts... At least, it is definitely the case for me.
So the important point is to feel comfident with the joseki you are choosing and be sure to follow the first moves correctly.
Here are the variations starting with this joseki if you want to study those: http://senseis.xmp.net/?34PointDistantLowApproach]
;W[fe]C[stp: as an example, this white move is not a joseki standard move]
;B[dd]C[stp: usualy, specifically in early moves, one tend to avoid touching stones. Results are that it will strengthen the opponent]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[ed];B[ec];W[de];B[db];W[dd];B[hd];W[cb];B[bc]
;W[bb];B[di]C[stp: result looks fine for Black];W[cn]TR[jc]
[kc][lc][mc][nc][qf][qg][qh][qi][qj][ck][qk][cl][ql][cm][qm]
[qn][fq][gq][hq][iq][jq][kq][lq][mq][nq]C[stp: I am not sure it was a good move for W. Usually one tend to paly where there is much more space (at this stage of the game)
You see with the Triangles spaces where W could have played]

(;B[cl]SQ[pj][jp]C[[KB\] - My idea here was to force his stone to either be shut off or a target for attack as he runs to the center.

stp: I might have played the same... Although I think it might be considered as a little too early. Maybe it is better to build moo forst and then conduct this attack
Q10 and K4 keeps you ahead];W[cj]SQ[el]
(;B[ci]C[[KB\] - I feel that D10 is better.

stp: I think the issue there is more that you are not consistent. You wrote earlier: "My idea here was to force his stone to either be shut off or a target for attack as he runs to the center".
Why do you change your strategy?
1/ Either you were surprised with the move and you didn't anticipate it... Which is a mistake
2/ Either you change your strategy... But then you must be clear on the reason for this. 

I think I would have played E9. I am not sure about  D10. I am not sure I like it but I can't really explain why]
;W[ck];B[ek];W[dl];B[dk];W[bl];B[dm];W[cm];B[dn];W[cq];B[el]
;W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[cr];B[bn]SQ[jp]C[[KB\] - I feel this move was wasted.

stp: definitely yes.
Once a wall is built, you need to stregthen it];W[bm];B[ip]
;W[gq];B[fq];W[fp]
(;B[gp];W[eq];B[dq];W[fr];B[go];W[jj];B[pj]C[stp: good!];W[nc]
;B[ld];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[nd]SQ[pe]C[stp: I think it is not good. Q15 is stronger. With Q15, W O17 will be in a very difficult position and you continue to stregthen the north moyo]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[pe];B[pf]C[stp: very bad!!!
you were lucky that W didn't play P15. The north moyo would have been completely reduced]

(;W[qf];B[oe];W[qe]
(;B[nf]SQ[pg]C[stp: why not Q13? What is the risk?];W[jd]
(;B[jc]C[stp: I am not sure I like this move very much.
Again, it is never good to touch stones directly];W[he];B[jf]
;W[id];B[ic];W[gd];B[hc];W[ie];B[gc];W[ke];B[jh];W[le];B[mg]
;W[kg]
(;B[kh]C[stp: I am not sur I like this idea to have both stones cut]
;W[jg];B[kj];W[hj];B[jk];W[ij];B[lk];W[dj]
(;B[fj]TR[ej]C[stp: why not E10?];W[ej]CR[hj][ij][jj]TR[fi]
C[stp: this move would have been much more efficient so as to try to kill the white stones in the middle of the board]

(;B[gl]C[sto: too defensive];W[fi];B[ei]TR[bd][be][ce][bf][cf]
[df][ef][ff][gf][bg][cg][dg][eg][fg][gg][bh][ch][dh][eh][fh]
[gh]C[[KB\] - Enclosing my corner or keeping white out of my sphere of influence seem more important. This move was bad and I played here more later as well.

stp: unless I am mistaken, from my perspective those black stones are dead and the territory is White]
;W[gi];B[hq];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[kq];W[qq]
(;B[qp]TR[or]C[stp: I think it is a mistake. At this stage, you could have tried to enclose white completely playing P2. You would have loose a few points in the corner but get the rest of the south est corner]
;W[pq];B[op];W[or];B[qr];W[pr];B[rq];W[rr];B[nr];W[mr];B[no]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[mq];B[mo];W[lq];B[lo];W[kp]
(;B[gr]TR[pg]C[[KB\] - Not as urgent as the right side. I like R12 or R10.

stp: agree, althoug L5 also is big.. I think protect Q14 is more important than R12 or 10 at this stage]
;W[jq];B[fq];W[qj];B[qi];W[pi];B[qk];W[rj]TR[nk][ok][pk][kl]
[ll][ml][nl][ol][pl][km][lm][mm][nm][om][pm][qm][ln][mn][nn]
[on][pn][qn][rn]C[[KB\] - I shoulnd't have fought here with my weakness above. I should have cut my losses.

stp: yes. The real battle there is the black moyo that you have to protect]

(;B[og];W[qh];B[pg];W[rh];B[ni];W[nh]
(;B[mh]TR[ql];W[si]
(;B[ng]C[stp: you loose one move. W cannot play here before he protect on R11]
;W[qi]
(;B[pl]TR[ql]C[stp: do not hesitate to play solid move when you can]
;W[ql];B[pk];W[qm];B[pm];W[qn];B[po];W[ih];B[ro];W[sn];B[rn]

(;W[rm]
(;B[pn];W[hl]C[stp: yes, it is important to close all gates before playing on the second line...]
;B[il];W[hm];B[hk];W[ik];B[jm];W[gk];B[gm];W[in]CR[kl]TR[kj]
[jk][lk][il][jm]C[stp: always carful with that kind of shape. What if W play at L8?]
;B[jo];W[eb];B[fb];W[da];B[bd]TR[bc][cc][ci][di][ei]C[stp: this is hopeless. those stones are dead]
;W[be];B[bf];W[ae];B[cf];W[dg];B[qg];W[rg];B[so];W[sm]
(;B[er]TR[dr]C[stp: sometime it is better to play simple. With D2 there is no ko and W is dead]
;W[gq];B[dr];W[hr];B[fq];W[kd];B[lc];W[gq];B[ce]C[[KB\] - My game was falling apart turns ago. I feel like my beginning was decent for the most part but then I lost focus abd played moves like these.
