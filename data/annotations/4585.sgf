AB[pd][dp]C[Hi reviewer,

I've already commented my plays before sending you the game, but reading the gtl guidelines, I see "no speed games"
I send it howerver since I have true questions.

thx for reviewing :)

--

hello, my name is lect and I will be reviewing your game.
since you dont state which you are in the game, i will have to assume you are black.

overall i think you played a good game. you should have won the game and i believe that you gave up too early. you have a pretty good "flow" in the game and you seem to move in the correct direction (although you miss a few steps along the way). the steps that you DO miss are the game-altering ones - study more life and death situations to better improve your overall game. you make too many cautious moves which does not allow you to activate the potential of your skill.

i enjoyed reviewing this game :)];W[de]C[lifandiss [13k\]: hello :)]

not very good positioning for B];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[jc];W[kd]
LB[ke:A]C[should I bend with 'a' here ?

--

here you are posed with a small problem. you have several weak groups currently on board. playing at A or extending downward would strengthen your group there but will allow W to attack the R17 group.

personally i feel that extending downward would be a good idea, but a bend play at A is too early.]
;B[qi];W[ok];B[dj];W[cq]
(;B[er]C[what about that move:
are there any joseki dealing with that ?
I thought it would threaten both 2 white groups.

--

seems like a good idea at first, but you are not strong enough to attack the F3 group.

typically you would concede the corner to W in this situation. see the variatuon]

should black protect at 'a' or 'b' instead ?

W cannot do anything with a move at B or A, so no need to respond there]

why force W to connect?];W[fm]

see previous comment];W[hl];B[hm]C[there's no hurry to cut, is there ?
E8 seems more urgent.

--

there is a cut, but it is hard to assess the potential. your groups are weak, which will pose a problem.]

start at the focal point of the group : its eyes!]

elsewhere ?

I still prefer a move around 'a',
what do your think ?
