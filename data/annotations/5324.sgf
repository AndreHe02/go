(;B[nd]LB[jg:A]C[olaf: thats perhaps the first mistake. 
To analyse the situation here: 
- there are 2 weak white groups separated by a weak black group. 
So your aim should be: 
- don't let the 2 white groups connect
- don't do anything to strengthen these 2 groups without strengthening your own splitting group
- best would be a move, where your splitting group gets stronger while threatening on both white groups.
This direct you naturally to a move somewhere around A.];W[md]
;B[oe];W[mb]C[olaf: look, now white isn't weak any longer whith this group, so he has hands free to fight on the other side. This is the drawback of the contact-play at O16. :-(]
;B[oa];W[mf];B[ig];W[qi]C[olaf: leaving the battlefield like this is allways a bit dangerous. The danger is not to lose the battle, but the opponent allow to take control in it to much.]
;B[ei]C[olaf: right direction, but wrong point. If you are attacking its allways good not to create to much weaknesses in the own position.]
;W[dg]C[olaf: good technic , if this stone is to abandon later.]

normally its a bit to wide from a 2-stone-wall like the marked stones, but here you are stong and inviting white to invade is a good strategy.]
;W[gq];B[co];W[cm];B[eo];W[cp];B[do];W[gm]
(;B[fl]C[olaf: don't strengthen white whithout good reasons! See, its a contact-play again. Not that i would say that contact-plays are bad (as empty triangles most offen are), but the main thing whith these contact-play is, that both sides get stronger. So look for contact-plays where you are weak and need some strength an avoid it, when you want to attack. Furthermore, here you have a very weak group around and first thought should be something to help this group.]
;W[fm]
(;B[dm]LB[dm:A][go:B]C[I feel this is my biggest mistake in the game.  Is it so?  I should have cut his group at B

olaf: there is all said about it allready.];W[em];B[dn]LB[go:A]
C[olaf: now there are 2 empty triangles. :-( I would think this is an evan worse move than the previous. At least here you have to jump to A, not to split the white groups, but to gain safty for your own.]
;W[go];B[cl];W[ck]
(;B[bl]TR[jp]C[olaf: what a terrible result for black. Playing this move is like resigning the game. The best result you can get now is, that your group will survive. This allowes white (whith all his groups are safe) can destroy most of the side-territory on the left. But thats the only area you have some points. 
So you have to try hard to find something better!
To illustrated this oppinion:
Now, that white is strong around, the marked stone looks as good any longer than some moves before, so don't count more than 10 points of territory there. Counting is a good idea now, lets try:
How many do you think has black? In the upper right? About 6-8 (white can get as far as T17 in sente). In the upper left? 15 perhaps? There are some cutting points that black has to worry about when white comes down to B9. Add 10 on the bottom and 4 for the half-dead group on the left and all black can hoe for is 35-40 points (dont be to accurate).
White has 25 on the right and 10 on the lower left for sure. Nothing that you can do about that. 4 points on the top + komi is enough to win. All white gains now in the fight will add to this advantage.]

What you should have learned in this game is:
Don't attatch what you want to attack!!

and
Stay strong when attacking. Otherwise the opponent has some clever counterattack.]
