C[I obviously messed up the bottom left and bottom, but the big center facing wall I got in return seemed to be pretty effective.  Still, I'd like to know how I could have handled the bottom situation better.  Any other comments throughout the game appreciated.  Thank you.

Hiya, I'll try and review as well as I can for you. If you have any questions that I haven't answered feel free to contact me on KGS. I am aitkensam or hotspur most of the time.

I have reviewed the bottom left in quite a lot of detail and put brief comments for some other key points, but blacks style after the bottom left fight is difficult to review :s

LB[mc:A]C[A is really needed here. Attack from a strong base is important. If black spends a whole move connecting his stones that is ok.

I will stop here as the interesting parts of the game as pretty much over.

White has two options. Crawl along the second line until he has enough liberties for C3 to win a semeai.

Black may take C3 and force white to hane of the second line. This would leave G3 group worryingly weak.

White can try and sacrifice the 3 stones to try and capture F6.
