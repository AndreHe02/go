C[(Tobias:)
I am aware of two big mistakes i made, one in the beginning when i didn't protect the group correctly that i consecutively lost (at move 43: p6 instead of
q6 should work), and to start the ko at 197, instead of the simple connection and a following invasion. I believe that even with this early loss of the 7 stones, the game was still fairly open, even though this capture made him very strong...]
;B[pd]C[(Dieter:)

As you probably remember from last review, I focus on two major principles in Go:

1. Connect your stones
2. Don't let yourself surround

and their counterparts

1. Cut your opponent's stones
2. Surround your opponent's stones

As you see, these principles make complete abstraction of the concept of territory. Connect, cut, surround and break through, should render territory in a natural way.]
;W[dp]C[(continuation)

Kyu Players tend to attach too much to individual stones and territory. Stronger players think before turning a stone into a group, and once they have done so, they continuously measure the relation between that group and the surrounding area's.]
;B[cd]C[
Some abbreviations before starting the commentary:

UL, LL, UR, LR: upper left, ..., lower right
US, LeS, RS, LoS: Upper side, ...
Cr: center
Bl: Black
Wh: White  Var: Variation
1,2,3, ... : the stone at 1,2,3 ...
-------];W[qp]C[(start of comments)];B[op]LB[id:a][ic:b]C[This is the right direction. Both White 2 and 4 want to extend along the LS. So coming in between (cut your opponent's stones) is a good idea.

Playing the Chinese opening, at A or B, would be an alternative approach, presumably leading to a moyo contest. Your move at 5 indicates that you prefer to develop this game into a struggle between several small(er) groups.]
;W[pq]LB[kp:a][kq:b][lp:c][lq:d][pn:e][oq:f]C[This is an unusual move.   At our club, I discourage the play of the kosumi (diagonal move). Rarely it is a good move locally, when keima or ikken-tobi are available.

White should pincer at A, B, C or D, or play keima at E.

Since Black wants to counter the influence of Wh2, you should welcome the invitation to strengthen your influence in that direction, and answer F without hesitation.]
;B[pp]LB[qo:a]C[So I can't approve of Black 7. Extending at A now is too easy for White.]
;W[qo];B[oq]C[This makes sense. A pity for the 7-4 exchange.]
;W[pr]MA[qq][qr][rq][rp][sp][ro][so][sq][rr][sr][ss][rs]LB[lp:a]
[kp:b][kq:c][lq:d]C[White makes 12 points of territory (marked), and his Stone at 8 influences the RS in a negative way for Black. The influence Black makes towards Cr and LoS doesn't make up for it.

Still, if you extend to A,B,C or D, although you will have made a bad exchange Black7-White4, your stones will still serve the right purpose: cut the opponent's groups, and counter the influence of Wh2]
;B[or]C[I reckon you thought this move was sente, but this is where a little thinking forward would have learnt that it is not. Probably you thought things would happen as in Var2:]

(;W[jq]LB[lq:a][fq:b][qq:c][pn:d]C[Very good by White:

- This is exactly the spot where Black wants to extend.  - The influence of the Black wall is nullified.
- It extends Wh 4.
- It disregards the Black claim for sente.

Now, what can you do ?

1) Extend to A, which gives strength to your wall, but which is also painfully submissive and overconcentrated.
2) Attack at B would be an overplay: the Black group in the LR is not strong enough to start operations that could affect its life.
3) Play elsewhere (tenuki): always an option, but then why play at the LoS in the first place ?
4) Since Wh hasn't answered your move at 11 locally, there must be a way  to exploit the aji that is left in the cut at C. Of course, we have shown that it doesn't work immediately. But try starting at D. (see var)]

(;B[ip]LB[jp:a]C[Probably you think this follows the principle "attack away from thickness".
The problem here is that Black is not thick at all. The four stones at the LR need reinforcement (see previous diags)

The "kata" or "shoulder-hit" you play, is a move for very special circumstances. When reducing the opponents moyo, mostly.

It is NOT an attacking move. Just like the "tsuke" (or attachment), the kata strengthens the opponent's stone. That's fine in an area where the opponent is already strong, making him overconcentrated. But here, strengthening Wh12 is the last thing you want.

Also, the obvious answer for white is A. This move cuts the Black stones.   While Black 7 and 11 where joseki mistakes, costing you several points, Black 13 goes against the logic of Go, and is the real start of your troubles in the beginning of this game.]
;W[mq]LB[jp:a]C[White should simply push up at A.];B[lr]LB[on:a]
[pn:b]C[Before you seek life at the bottom, first get out. Ikken tobi at A or B is just fine]
;W[lq];B[mr];W[kr]C[These moves where consistent.]
(;B[nq]LB[nr:a][os:b][jp:c]C[Several reasons why this move is bad.

1) It prevents a cut at A which doesn't work anyway.
2) Due to white B, the eye at A is still false.
3) Even if Black makes an eye at the bottom, it is MUCH better for black to jump out, following principle 2. Eyes you only make when you have no other choice.
4) Black 5-9-11-19 make a Farmer's Hat, a very bad shape. That in itself should already make you dismiss this move as an option.

Let me present an alternative for Black 19, punishing White for not having pushed up at C earlier.]
;W[hq]LB[mo:a]C[White also should simply jump out to A, to split Black's forces.]

(;B[fq]LB[kp:a][pn:b][dj:c]C[White having strengthened himself at the lower side, it is a bad idea playing there.   Force him into bad shape at A, then look at the board.

White has invested all his money into the lower side, and his return on investment is rather low.

Black has invested in a still rather weak group, that should however be able to escape.

Play B first (a move I have been recommending for quite a time now)
and then tenuki, e.g. at C, enlarging your own sphere of influence, and reducing White's.

I'll give all of them in a variation:];W[dq];B[hp]C[Yes ! Good move: connecting your stones # : - 7]

;B[jm]MA[fm][mk][mj][ni][nh][ei][ek][ej][fl]C[This is strong, but slow. Anyway, your stones are connected. White gets a lot of points AND sente. The game will be very tough on you - you have to catch up with some 50 points, but you influence the center along the marked lines.]
;W[cj]LB[jd:a]C[Good by white: this is a large area.   Farthest away from th Black strength, and the largest open area  is the TS. A play around A would be perfect.]
;B[fc];W[qh];B[cm]C[Yes ! Very good idea:  split up White's forces, use your strength, attack. There will be some profit coming from it.]

C[Connects. Good.];W[cg];B[ci]C[Oh. This is wrong. 66 and 80 are stones you want to attack. When playing tsuke against them, you strengthen them.

;W[do];B[qj]C[You should continue at the left side, but I imagine you didn't see that connection.   89 is another splitting move. The idea is good, albeit somewhat close to white's force.]

;W[gk];B[hl]LB[bg:a][le:b]C[There is no time to capture worthless stones like 50.   Apart from the already mentioned and critical move at A, you could try surrounding a large area with B.

;W[kg];B[kf];W[jg];B[jf];W[lg]LB[bp:a]C[White makes a defensive move. Always a good moment to stop and count the game.

Black:

LL: 15 +
LS: unsettled
LR: 30 +
Cr-R: 10 +
komi: 5

So, you are suddenly ahead in points, but white has still a lot of development, and the left side (a 40 points) is unsettled.

You must first do something about it, albeit unclear what. A keima at A to make life, may be the best shot.]

Let's count.

Black: still about 70 points

White: the 60 he had, plus 16+ at the left side.

So you are 6 points behind and white has more potential. Let me play the endgame as I would pay it, that's variation 2. Full of mistakes of course, a professional wouldn't want to see it.]

;W[qj]C[Game over and end of comments.


You got at a disadvantage early in the game, and had to fight your way back. You managed to transform the whole upper side into territory, skillfully using your thickness in the center.   You failed to see the enormous potential of your own move at 85, which could lead to an attack on the left side, using your central thickness for a second time.

When he secured his stones there, capturing yours, he was already ahead with more than 10 points. However, you started to play a good endgame, and if it weren't for the careless ko invitation at 197, you could have leveled the score.

Although I have never played on IGS myself, I know you have to play fast and haven't got the time to make deep calculations. A game on IGS is good to test your reflexes and intuition. So don't feel discouraged by variations you failed to see. They are given merely to illustrate a general point. What you should learn from this game is:

- Are my moves really sente ? (move 11)
- A shoulder hit strengthens my opponent. Do I want that ? (move 13)
- Jump out FIRST (don't let yourself surround) THEN (if surrounded) make eyes (move 19)
- An area where my opponent has invested a lot of stones is uninteresting to me. Playing in that area may spell trouble (move 21)
- When surrounded, make an eye in order to live or to maximize the effect of a sacrifice (move 35)
- Attack a group with a keima, a  boshi or a placement. NOT with a tsuke (81)
- When behind, there is no time for submissive play (117, 155, 157)

You have a good feel for shape and tesuji. Examples include:

115, 141, 153, 163, 193
