AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, I am playing with the black stones and would like to get some help, new ideas and answers to my questions? Please also point out other mistakes and wrong ways of playing.

Thanks a lot!



R: Hi, I will mark my comments with 'R:'

R: On the whole, you played a good game with only a big blunder with the hane at O13.
Otherwise, you are a little too kind with white, letting him lead the game when you have opportunities to take the sente.
Try to be more obstinate in your games. When your opponent doesn't answer your moves, make him pay for it :)]

(;B[cn];W[jq]C[This happens to me quite often: black attacks two corners and gets with a third stone a very big area? Is this result good for black or would it be better to play h3 or m3 after f3 or o3?

R: I think it is a little too easy for white. Since you have handicap stones, using them to make pincers would seem natural.
I've put some variations]
(;B[jd]C[R: I don't really like this move. for two reasons
1) White position at the bottom is still weak, maybe you can use this to secure your corners first
2) I don't like playing high moves when the opponent has the opportunity to slide under]

(;W[qf];B[qh]C[R: good :)];W[of];B[nd];W[qc];B[qd]C[Is this the right side to block?

R: yes, when you're strong enough, always keep white's stones apart.
It is strange from white to make a tobi and then to invade]

(;B[rc]C[R: a mistake];W[rb];B[rd];W[qa]C[R you can still kill with a ko (as you've seen later in the game)]
;B[oh];W[mf];B[le];W[mc];B[nc];W[jb]C[R: the dreaded move]
(;B[kc]C[R: too kind. maybe try L18 or simply tenuki (M14 is interesting)]
;W[kb];B[lb];W[pk]C[How to defend against Q9? During the next moves I nearly lost all my stones around S16 an R12.

R: the idea was good (to attack the three white stones)
Things turned bad with the hane at O13.];B[lf];W[nh]
(;B[ng]C[R: not the good side. Either O11 or P11 feels better.]
;W[og];B[mh]C[R: wrong move, you're pushing white toward capturing your stones]

C[What is an idea to play now? Secure my lower right corner? or play D9? Or make territory with maybe J12? Can I attack his lower or upper left group?

R: I've marked some possible moves
D9 is slow. E6 is better
J12 is small.];B[oq];W[cd]
(;B[bd]C[R: you shouldn't be distracted that much easily from your plans. White didn't answer P3, use it to your advantage
Otherwise, D15 would have been better than B16];W[bc];B[dd]
;W[cc];B[be]C[R: E16 or D15 is better. If white comes at B15, you can stop him with B14 with little loss.]
