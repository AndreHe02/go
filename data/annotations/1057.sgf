(;B[br]C[This should be one line higher, this doesnt form an eye (as white
can play A4), and leaves B with a weak group in the corner. This
week group causes problems which echo throughout the rest of the
game. This move at B2 instead of B3 is possibly  B's major error in  the game.]
;W[co];B[bn]LB[er:a]TR[cn]C[Its better to make life at (a), sacrificing the marked stone]
;W[ap];B[bq];W[dn];B[cm];W[dm];B[ec]LB[dr:a][er:b]C[This move is good, but if white plays at (a), the  corner dies. B should play at (b)]
;W[nc];B[pf]LB[pc:a][qf:b][lc:c]TR[pf]C[better to play at (a), then if later white plays at (b), B then
plays this move (Q14).. B would then develop thickness along line Q, and
so could then in turn invade at (c). In other words, this move is
too defensive, playing (a) enlarges B's potential territory, and  threatens (c). Also, if white does invade at (b), then (c) becomes a
solid opportunity.];W[hc];B[oc];W[lc];B[nd]LB[er:a]C[This is pretty small. (a) is more important]
;W[md];B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[fq];B[go];W[fo]LB[dr:a]C[(a) is better for W]
;B[gp];W[bk]LB[dr:a]C[still (a)];B[bj];W[cg];B[ck];W[bm];B[hq]
;W[al]C[This doesnt achieve very much for W, the left  hand group is very strong.]
;B[ej];W[gn];B[io]LB[hr:a]TR[hq][ep][fp][gp][go][jp][mq]C[better at (a), to guarantee that the white staones will die. This
move represents whites second major mistake. W now proceeds to make
life on the bottom and leaves Blacks marked stones without eyespace.]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[hr];B[iq];W[ir];B[gs]LB[er:a]C[B has to make life for their corner group with (a).]

[go][ho][io][jo][jp][jn]LB[ik:a]C[This move seems bad, because of the weakness of black's marked group.
W now has an opportunity to split Black in two. I would have played (a)
to try to link the group with one of the two black groups above it.]

the black groups will almost certainly die.];B[mn];W[lo];B[lm]

[gp][go][ho][io][jo][jp][jn][km][lm][mm][mn][ol][ql]C[This doesnt do very much, whites top group is secure, and whites side
group (along line 10) can always run out to (b) threatening blacks
group below. B's marked stones don't have very much eye space, and
must still try to escape further into the center. B should have
played (a)];W[nh]LB[kj:a]C[(a) would be better, white may kill black, but even if they do not, the
top right center will probably become white territory];B[oi]
;W[oj];B[ni];W[mi];B[mj];W[og];B[ph]LB[qi:a]C[This shape forms an empty triangle, (a) would have been better.]
;W[li]LB[mk:a][lj:b][nl:c]C[This is too generous of white, with this move he sacrifices his
four stones on line 10, and gives black's lower center group unconditional
life, Instead, if white (a), black (b), white (c), B is in a real
bind, as white can cut B in two and can still work on surrounding
blacks lower center group];B[mk];W[pg];B[qf];W[qg];B[rg];W[ii]
;B[rh];W[on];B[nm]LB[om:a]TR[ql]C[I would prefer (a), that would make a slightly stronger connection
to the marked stone.];W[nn];B[om];W[gk];B[dh];W[hg];B[lj]LB[er:a]
[nb:b]C[(a) is still the biggest move, but ignoring that, (b) is quite big
and sente];W[ki];B[kj]C[small];W[jj];B[el];W[em]C[There are bigger points for W, this move isnt worth much]

and should be played instead];B[be];W[jk]LB[sl:a]C[This shouldnt give white much territory, (a) is bigger]
;B[kk]MA[hm][im][il]C[??? There isnt much territory for B here, any of the marked points
would practically eliminate W's potential territory in that region]
;W[im];B[fl];W[gl];B[me]LB[sm:a]C[This doenst have much of a chance, (a) is bigger]
;W[mf];B[le];W[lf];B[fd];W[gc];B[hf];W[if];B[gh]LB[gg:a]C[(a) is bigger, this move cant advance much into W territory, whereas
white (a) will advance further into B's];W[hh]LB[gg:a]C[(a) is bigger]

plays (b).];B[is];W[js];B[oe];W[nf];B[aj];W[fk];B[ak];W[bl]
;B[ko];W[gr];B[fs]TR[eq][fq][gq]C[In summary, because B's bottom left corner group was weak, white
was able to exert pressure upon it, developing thickness for use later
in the game. Later white's marked stones regained life, and this left
the Black group above those stones without eyespace. Whilst black
attempted to stabilise those stones, white developed a wall above them
which made territory in the center.])
(;B[bq]LB[ap:a]C[This move doesn't leave white as good aji at (a)]
;W[co];B[er];W[fr];B[ds];W[dn]C[Continuing on.. white ends in gote]
;B[ed]C[then B can strengthen their corner.];W[ch]C[if white invades]
;B[ej]C[a not too bad fight will erupt.   I think this is a reasonable result, B has both corners, white has
some outside influence, but B has moves that to some extent negate
that thickness]))
