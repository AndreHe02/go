AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi,
thanks for reviewing. The game was hard.
I couldn't do anything. Even if for a while it had looked good, W do what they wanted.

Paul

Hi, my name is Hugo, I'll be reviewing your game today...  My style of reviewing generally attempts to avoid specifics - this move was good or this move was bad - in favour of general principles you can apply to your games.  So firstly here I'll list some things you should work on, and then throughout the game attempt to illustrate where these points crop up.

A) You need to learn the 'standard responses' to moves or 'basic instincts' (http://senseis.xmp.net/?BasicInstinct), and use them in your games.  They aren't always the right move, and if you have a really good argument in a particular situation then you can ignore them, but most of the time you can bet they'll be spot on.  Put another way - you need to learn the standard responses first, so that you can have a good reason for ignoring them later.

B) Go is all about connections.  Creating connections between your groups of stones makes them stronger - you get to share eye space, and without connections between your stones there is no territory to protect.  Breaking connections between enemy stones is how you isolate the weak and kill them.  Without breaking connections between enemy stones you'll have to kill the entire group - hard.  You (and your opponent to be fair) both missed opportunities to keep weak groups connected, or to split strong groups into two weak groups.  The edges of the board are OFTEN useful in keeping groups connected.

C) You want to win.  In order to win, you have to have more territory than the opponent.  That's it!  So there's no need to invade an area 'just because it is there' - you need to keep counting in the game, and when you are ahead, relax and solidify what you have.  Once you're ahead in territory, solidify and wait for the opponent to invade, then punish the invading stones.  In this game you started out ahead, and eventually lost because you lost a whole host of stones in the centre.  But wait a moment!  All along you were ahead in the balance of territory - you had loads of potential on the right, loads on the bottom, and white made a mess of your invasion at the top!  So how on earth was it that you were on the defensive in the middle?  Because you allowed yourself to be dragged into a fight there - next time don't be so quick to start a fight.  Save that for when you're behind :)]
;W[dd];B[jp];W[nc];B[qf];W[nd]C[Aside: this was one of the weakest moves in the game by white.  If he already had a white stone in place on say k16 this might be acceptable, but it's a very 'slow' way to play - if he must play here I prefer o15.  Black should now immediately punish with k16, or simply grab another excellent big point at d10 or q10 to form up a double-wing shape, and leap ahead in terms of moyo.  Incidentally q10 is probably better as it works with existing stones more effectively.]
;B[pj];W[cn];B[co];W[dn]C[Aside: This is not a mistake by white this time - totally acceptable given that you've made contact.  As expected you play f4, leaving him d10 and everyone is happy.  If you play d10, he will e4, squeezing your corner quite tightly and uncomfortably.]
;B[fp];W[dj];B[ic]C[Brilliant!  An excellent move, leaving you the two-space extension on either side of your invading stone, and making his two stones very uncomfortable.  This is excellent play - black is now very comfortably ahead.  Both black and white have a weak group on the board, but white has invested two stones in his weak group - very bad news.]
;W[jd]
(;B[fc]C[A) The usual response to a diagonal contact is the extension.  Here I think it is also the correct response.  j16 isn't great as it leaves you with a baseless 2-stone string, which leaves us k17, which I like.  See variation.]
;W[gd]C[Paul: I didn't know how to answer.

A) Again this is a diagonal touch to a stone, an extension is usually called for.  f16 doesn't make any sense since white will g17 and cut the two black groups apart, so g17 is the only choice - unless we ignore the standard response.  But here I think it's the right response.]

(;B[fd]C[B) Bad news.  Bad move, since white can now cut the groups apart.]
;W[gc]C[Excellent, white cuts the two black groups in two, this is bad news for black.  He should not have f16 for this reason.]
;B[gb]
(;W[fe]C[Appauling!  White is now letting black connect again with h17 - the most urgent move on the board now.  White should have played f15, see variation.]
;B[dc]C[B) Also bad, by now you can see that h17 was the crucial move for black too.  Then both groups are joined.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[id];B[jc];W[kc];B[cd];W[de];B[bf];W[ce];B[bd]
;W[be];B[ci]C[B) A15 would have allowed you to connect both the top group and the floating stone at b14, damaging whites middle severely.  As it is, now white has the opportunity to cut them apart, which means that the middle will have to survive on their own.]
;W[cj];B[ef];W[ee];B[dg];W[ae]C[B) Now you pay the price for not having kept the connection at a15.  There are four stones, a perfect target for white to attack, without much eye-space.  Enough for one eye certainly, but not a definite two.  You'll have to struggle to make them survive.  And while you're struggling, white will probably make some more territory.  How much easier if you'd simply connected at a15, and ruined his chances for territory in the middle?]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[he];W[hd];B[hf]C[C) Okay so here we go.  Now you've got two very weak groups in the middle, but fair enough I can see that you're keen on attacking his (also weak) group on the far left.  BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS!  It's irrelevant that it's a juicy target of attack, the point is that you're way ahead in the balance of potential territory!  He should be the one risking all-out attacks, risking the entire game on the life-or-death of a risky weak group, not you!  Your moves would be much better spent increasing your moyo at the key turning points between yours: o14, f6 and f7, k10, solidifying your bottom right with q3, r3, or r4.  I would think that k10 alone would be about enough to make me want to resign as white!  You're missing your opportunity - when ahead, DON'T GET INVOLVED in dirty battles around the place - you don't need to.  Keep your head above the skirmishes, try and make things as simple as possible.  It's when you're behind (as white is now) that you should be risking everything in a desperate attempt to take some territory away from your opponent.]
;W[gg];B[hg];W[eh];B[fg];W[ff];B[eg];W[fh];B[gh]C[C) Well, this has now become very complicated.  White's missed a couple of very important connections, and now it looks like you have a chance to get something out of it - capture the d16 chain and the game is yours!

But stop a moment.  Do you need to kill them?  Your prospects for territory on the bottom and right are enormous.  Vast.  You already have some solid territory on the top.  (Actually right now a white play at h18 will split off your two black stones - you might want to move there yourself pretty soon).  Why not just pull your middle stones out to safety, then with a move like k10 start to build a huge moyo in the bottom right?  I don't think you need to be trying to kill here.  Especially as (sigh) it turns out not to work :)]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[ch];B[bh];W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[hb];B[fb]
;W[hh];B[gi];W[ih]C[Excellent, j12 is about the first really good move I've seen white play.  There is no way to save the black stones now, you've lost this race.  But the game is very far from over!  Big moves at the corner of your moyos, like f7, o14, and perhaps k10 are all begging to be played.You could just reinforce your corner against invasion at r3.  It's still yours to win.]
;B[jf];W[if];B[ig];W[jg];B[bj];W[di];B[bi];W[bk];B[ak];W[bl]
;B[ag];W[af];B[cf];W[ie];B[pb];W[of]C[Of the two points, white takes the bigger one.  q18 secured your corner, but didn't impact on his.  That's why o14 would have been so big - it improves your right hand side prospects, and at the same time damages his central prospects.  Likewise f6 or f7 - improve your own moyos and destroy his.]
;B[ph];W[jn];B[hn]C[A) This is a very bad shape move - the 'double diagonal' (a stone that is two squares diagonally from another) is usually a bad form of move, since the in-between diagonal is the perfect cutting point for the enemy.  This is a double-double diagonal!  So it's horrible!  H5 would have been much better.]
;W[io]C[Excellent, white punishes properly.  And in the end you have to give up h6, which costs you a lot of central territory.]

;B[dl];W[em];B[ck];W[cl];B[el];W[gj];B[dk];W[dm];B[fk];W[fj]
;B[fm];W[jk]C[C) Not much to say here, this was a fight for some stones that frankly didn't have much of a chance.  You're only a little bit behind right now, assuming that all the black stones in the middle die.  I would be playing around p9, b6, monkey jump to n19, nice endgame move at h19.  All of these could give you a fighting chance.  And there's o12 to really damage the centre.]

;B[mh];W[mi];B[ng];W[mf];B[nf];W[oe];B[ne];W[me];B[od];W[lh]
C[This worked out well, more white stones captured.  If you can keep p6 stones dead, and you don't have a white invasion now, you might even win.  So now is the time for a move like r3, to save your corner.  Actually the time for this was probably a long time ago.]
;B[ni];W[lj];B[mk];W[mj];B[oj];W[nk];B[nl];W[ml];B[ok];W[pm]
;B[ol];W[ep]C[B) You have to maintain your connections.  e3 is the only move you can play here.  If you are certain that he will cut you apart if you play e3 then fair enough, but you're going to lose the game if he breaks through into this unprotected area, which you let him do with d3.  If you're sure you can't defend at e3, then this means that you should have played there yourself a number of turns ago.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[fq];W[er]C[Catastrophe, now you're going to lose a lot of points.]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[cq];W[ao]C[End of comments.  He cleans up now.]

Yes, you have to protect the R5 cutting point somehow.];W[qo]

(;W[hb];B[fb];W[hc]C[And the black stone on the right is safely cut off.]

(;B[gc]C[And black is comfortable.  If white continues, perhaps building central influence:]
;W[hd];B[jc]
(;W[ld])
(;W[kd]C[White is starting to build some kind of centre-facing wall.  But it's full of weak points, and besides he has a lot of work to do before he could properly close it off - so black can stop him scoring much in the middle.]
)))
(;B[jc];W[kd];B[fc]C[Here white gains some central influence in exchange for black getting solid top side territory.  But white's centre influence isn't going to be much use - black is solid on the right hand side, it's too early to hope to make much of it in the centre.  Plus with moves like m18 for black, white's group is still baseless - white has come out very badly from this exchange, k16 wasn't a good move.]
