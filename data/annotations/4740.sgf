AB[pd][dp]C[Hi I am Ranppa and am playing black in this game which I ended up winning, but I think it still shows well some of my most common mistakes. I would like to know the basics of how I should play the first few moves in a handicap game. It would also be nice to know  what would have been the best way to reduce the huge white group in the right side and what would have been the best time to attack it. Hmmm... and if you could suggest some books that would help me, it would be nice.

Thanks in advance.

Hi.
I'm Michal‚ Piaskowski and I'm going to comment your game.
I'm about 15k. 
It's my first comment for GTL, hope you find it useful.];W[dd]

I think playing at A or B would be better];W[bp];B[cq];W[dl]

If you want to play near D8 then the triangle would be better.

But I would suggest playing somewhere else.

I like black A here. It's a nice extension from the triangled stones.]

You shouldn't worry about white connecting there. Even if he does it, he's group is still week.
