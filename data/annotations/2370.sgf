JVD [14k\]: enjoy the game !
Hello to the reviewer.
Thank you for helping me.
I
played black and i loose. One evident reason is the loss of a big group early
in the game. I think i found a variation which avoids that, but i'm not so
sure.
But anyway, I need advice on all the game. I'll try to ask along the game.
Thanks again.


Hello my name is Rogerio Luz and I will be your reviewer today. 

Every time you see a : "R>" it will be one of my coments. 

Hope you enjoy.];W[qf];B[nd];W[qn];B[np]C[Some people play Q10 or S8
when should one play O4 or N3 or Q1Ã  or S8 ?


R>
First thing to remember is that white is playing SUPER OVERPLAYS when he
plays this way. This is part of playing white against a 4 handi game, but
it is not the best way. WhiteÂ´s second play is usualy at Q10 making moyo
on the side, since it is too easy to take the corner in handi games.

I
think the best move here is R8 (pincer) because it puts a lot of pressure
on the TWO stones at once. shatever white tries to do it will be VERY hard
to live with both stones.];W[pj]C[R> Great play by white.];B[jc]
C[R>
Nice... but perhaps you should consider D10 that seems bigger for black right
now... it makes a good conterpart for white's moyo.];W[fc];B[ec]
;W[fd];B[df];W[ic];B[jd];W[ld]C[R>
WOW! SUPER OVERPLAY number 2. M17 connects fairly easily, and connecting
you can put a lot of pressure on 3 white groups: (see variations) 

1- F toJ17
2- M16
3- R14]

;W[rd]C[afterwards, i thought i should have prevented the connection beetween N18 and R17, not beetween R17 and R14
but how could i know BEFORE ? What is the good way of thinking ?


R> Fairly simple really. Witch side is strong? 

R14 has much more chance of living then N18, so let him conect the corner only with the already living stones. 

This means R16 should have been at Q17]

(;B[ki];W[li];B[jj];W[ni]C[R>
Now it was time for a BIG sacrifice... M10 is going to threaten N11 and both
groups are conected. white will not let this happen and will play N10 and
then black cuts at H9 and white will have a dificult time making two eyes
(see variation) .]

white here plays very badly, if you Q1 a ko results, and as you can make
a 31 point ko threat at T13 (this ko is worth 35 points ) he will lose one
of them, but if he played at O1 instead of O3 he would live in seki and would
have lost nothing.]

R>
Losing big groups is mostly bad. But this time you could have sacrificed
one to gain almost the same amount from one of your oponent's groups. 

The more important thing to see is that you made many, many weak groups, and YOU were the one with 4 handi!!. 

Look
at this board now and see how many groups you made... 3 living and 1 dead
= 4 groups!! this means he totally cut your handi stones in one time or the
other durring the game... and handi stones are made to make HIS life miserable
not to make you need to live with them.
