AB[dd][pd][dp][pp];W[qf];B[nc];W[qn];B[np];W[pj]C[Your responses at o17 and o4 are perfectly fine. But in a handicap game, I sometimes like to avoid giving white the entire side like this. Of course, it is still open for invasion later, but this is a nice framework for white. You could perhaps consider a pincer instead.]
;B[dj]C[A big move.];W[lq];B[jq]C[This move is good because you have support at D4. You could also consider N5, which is a balanced response to M3.]
;W[lo]
(;B[jo];W[lm];B[jm]C[You are building a good wall here. But it's unpleasant to have white seal you in like this. Variation shown.]
;W[cq]C[There is a rule you should follow about which side to block against the 3-3. Whichever side is wider is the direction you want to build your wall. In this case, D10 is equally far as K3. So you might think that it's about the same and that you could block either side. But I think it might be better to block the other way. Variation shown.]

;B[oq];W[rp]LB[qp:B][qq:A][qr:C]C[I feel very uncomfortable with this move, and dont't know how to work through it. If I run with black, white will only make more territory, so I need to defend... right? I didn't know which I'd play, A B or C.

I would say there is a 4th option. Of the ones you mention, I like your choice of A. But let's consider attaching at S5. Variations shown.]

(;B[qq];W[rq];B[rr];W[sr];B[pm]C[I like your choice of playing actively here. But your corner isn't fully alive yet. It has some eyespace problems.]

Yeah, your group looks somewhat safe now. This move is a bit slow.]

C[Ah. This move is a mistake with direction. As I said earlier. You must block the other way here. You want to build your wall facing whichever side is wider. This wall has 4 spaces from j17, but the other wall has 5 spaces. Variation shown.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[cf];B[fd]LB[rd:B][hk:A]
C[This move does indeed look necessary. Which is why it might be better to play h17 instead of j17. The downside of the tighter pincer is that it would not have as much of a relationship with the upper right. So I'm not saying your move was bad. Just different. The farther the pincer, the more important this move at f16. And it's no fun to have gote here. A and B are very big points that black would be very happy to get here.]
;W[rd]C[And white gets one of the big ones.];B[qc];W[od]C[This move feels really aggressive, and I think I should have punished it more, but did not find a way to. Any comment on it>?

I must admit that I have never really seen this move. I suspect that means that it is probably a mistake. The question is how to punish it. And that's not obvious to me.]
;B[oc];W[jd]LB[jc:B][id:A]C[Another annoying shoulder hit that I don't know how to deal with. Where should I aim towards? A or B?

I think it has to be B. There is too much territory on top to give up. I can't really see what A gets you.]

(;B[jc];W[ld];B[lc];W[lf]LB[of:F][eg:E][hk:D][nk:B][kl:C][pl:A]
[ql:G][qo:H]C[At this point I see he wants to fortify that center area, and he's making a lot of territory, which I don't see how I can attack.

This was a nice combination for white. Black is a bit low on the top. These moves ended up working well for white. 

But as it stands on the board. You have a lot of solid, finished territory. White has the corners on the left, and the right side. The center is still a bit uncertain. Perhaps you could just play reducing moves. If you consolidate your center potential and reduce white's I think you can win this game. 

I have marked some of the areas I am thinking about. First of all, you could make your way into white's center with a combination like A and B. You could exchange moves on the right with white. That is shown in the first variation. 

You also can't ignore the fact that you have some interesting cutting aji around C. You will have to make some sneaky moves to prepare it, but I'll show those in the second variation. 

F is another direction to poke into the center. You can try jumping in from up there. That's the third variation. 

D and E are nice moves for black once the fighting here is finished. You should play your big sente reducing/invading moves. Then you should take the first opportunity to get D. It is huge.]

(;B[if]C[I don't really like this move. It's hard to attack these white stones, because they can connect easily. It does not make a big reduction of white's center. And it does not make a big expansion of your own territory. I think h9 is bigger.]

(;B[me];W[mf];B[oe];W[ne];B[nd];W[nf]C[You capture a stone here, but at what cost? This wall is very solid, and white's center is looking more and more like solid territory.]
;B[ke];W[le];B[kd];W[jr]C[At least I was able to reduce some part of the upper territory, but it is still far from sufficient.

I disagree. You can answer this atari by connecting.]

;B[ko];W[tt];B[tt]C[So, I have a really crappy endgame that needs improvement. There were some other mistakes that were really obvious that I should have dealt with.

Regardless, it seems like he is making territory much quicker than I am, and I don't know how to punish that.

I would like to know where I could have had better direction of play, and what moves were more urgent whenever I slacked.

Thanks the reviewer for your time!

I would agree that your endgame is a bit too passive. You should never just blindly follow your opponent. You should think hard about whether or not his endgame move is sente. If it is not, leave it and go play your own sente moves. Play double sente first (i.e., play the moves that are sente for both you and your opponent). 

As for who made territory quicker, this was a handicap game. So it should be difficult for white to make territory faster than black. You start off the game ahead. White can only get ahead by playing faster than black. For that you can look at when you played slack moves and see how you could have played more efficiently. I tried to emphasize the big moves you omitted. I think the turn at q8 was very big for white. I also thought you missed your chance to reduce white's center.

As for direction of play, you should keep in mind what I said about blocking the 3-3 stone. That will help. And you should lao watch out for center development. There is always time to reduce a moyo before it becomes territory. You just have to be careful about not waiting until it is too late. If your opponent makes several moves to solidify, it will be very hard for you.

I would also add that you should count (or at least estimate) the score from time to time. You should always have some idea of how you are doing in the game so you know how you should play. At a few points, you said you felt behind and this led you to play some desperate moves. But you were still doing fine, and you could just make your territory solid to win the game. 

Overall, I think you show a lot of very good instincts. You could just work on a few of the things I mentioned, and that should help you level up a bit. As always, tesuji go problems will be very helpful. And you could also try a few of those "find the biggest whole board" go problems as well. Those are very helpful (for everyone). 

Best of luck.

And you said you were tempted to play that weak move (the double atari one) because you were worried about being behind. It is important to count rather than just rely on a hunch like that. 

White has 10 in the lower left and about 10 in the upper left. Being generous, white has about 25 on the right. And giving a generous center, I'd say it looks like about 25 to 30 there. 

Black has 25 on the top. About 5 in the bottom right. And about 35 in the big group. That leaves the game pretty close. Reducing white would be enough to win that game. White is easier to reduce here than black. Black is very solid in many places and white has holes still. So I think endgame could win it from here. No need to feel behind.]
