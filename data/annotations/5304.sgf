C[Thank you for reviewing my game.

I'm playing black and my rank on IGS is 22k. My opponent was of 20k strength.

This was one of my best games so far, even though I would have lost it, if white hadn't started a failed invasion attempt at the end of the game.

I'd mostly like to hear comments about general strategy and openings, since I think that I need to improve in those areas.

Thanks again for the review.

Hi im Micha≈Ç Piaskowski and I'm 12k in Poland.
I have been assigned to review your game.
I'll sepparate my comments from your questions with

Until now it's was ok, but N17 is wery small at this time.

I think you K16 whould be very good now.
It won't allow white to extend from his two stones in upper left corner.]
;W[id]C[---
This move is very nice for white]
(;B[jc]C[---
Small, you should play at the bottom of the board, or on the left side]
;W[ic];B[jd];W[if];B[dj];W[dh];B[bi];W[bg];B[cm]C[This was meant to prepare an attack on the upper left side. The shape doesn't look good though.

---
There is no way you can attack upper left now. white is very strong there. 
Instead you should attack the weak white group at the bottom.

Also don't forget, that white has sente now.];W[eq]
(;B[gb]C[---
Attacking this group is wrong.

You lived here only beacouse of 
your opponent's mistakes];W[ib];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[ed];B[fd]

(;W[ih];B[he];W[ie];B[hf];W[hd];B[ef];W[df];B[fg]C[Too cautious I guess.

White is very strong in this area, and living with this group will be hard.

I think you should try to run, so F12 would be better.];W[eg]

White wall makes your group on the left weak.
Now white can attak it by playing at B9, C9 or B8];W[ke];B[ld]

C[Bad move.

There are better moves (bottom of the board), but localy this isn't that bad.]

This is bad.
See variation];W[kh];B[ji];W[jg];B[ii];W[kg]C[---
Very bad move for white.
He makes eyes with it, but this group would live anyway,
so white just gave away sente.]

I like M10 more here, and you still can play something on the bottom of the board.]

You could play closer to white stones,
but gennerally this is good.
It's very big, and should have been played long time ago.];W[iq]

I think white was loosing from the begginig, he was makig up through the whole game, but didn't make up enough piints.
