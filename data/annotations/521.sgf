;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[cq];B[pj];W[fp]C[This is a key point in the game, already.  Black has to decide whether to break up white's  formation on the left, or to  let both sides build in their areas of strength.]
;B[fc]C[This seems a reasonable choice. My personal taste is for C10, but I don't think either move is clearly better.]
;W[df];B[jd];W[nc]C[This white move at O17 seems unwise.  A premature invasion. White can complete the left side, or play at O3.  With F4 high, O3 is a big area for white to build.  O17 just gives black a target for attack.

Plus, white can still be invaded at C9 or C12.];B[lc]C[This is the wrong direction, probably.  Black M17 doesn't use the stones F17 and K16. White can still play R17 and then K16 will be overconcentrated.

I think black should play P17 to attack white's stone by making it heavy.  Or Q17/18, to make white run out.]
;W[ne]C[But white runs anyway. I think that R17 or R14 would be better than O15.  White is running with no real target for attack.]
;B[pf]C[Q14 is a key move.  White there would completely turn the tables.]
;W[pb];B[qc]C[This trade doesn't really help white make much eye space, and decreases white's options in the corner.  This is a good trade for black.]
;W[dn]C[D6 is a crazy move by white. White has a weak group in the top left.  White will pay big!  Black can play O13 for example, and then what will white do?

Also even if white does play elsewhere, O3 or D9/10 are probably better spots than D6.]
;B[ch]C[White has a weak group! Rather than invade, and make things messy, first attack the weak group, then once you see how that settles out, you can decide where you want to invade.  Plus you'll have a lot of strength backing you up because you'll get to make nice moves while white is just saving the upper right group.]
;W[ck];B[eh];W[fe]C[These moves seem to follow normally.  White might want G15 instead of F15 to put a bit more pressure on black at the top (after G15, G17 is a bigger threat than after F15)]
;B[db]C[Black is much weaker below than above, so black should play a move to help the lower stones.]
;W[cc]C[This is a bad trade for black. Now if white invades around H17, black is weak on both sides

(black cannot flexibly shift to the corner, because of the trade, but neither group is big enough to make eyes, either).]
;B[jp]C[Now both sides are ignoring the weaknesses at the top (the D18/C17 trade makes it hard for black to handle an H17 invasion) and weaknesses on the left side.  White is weak in the top right.

When you're making a move, first look at the weak groups (where am I weak?  Where is he weak?) and only then look for the territory.

In accordance with that principle, I would play O13.  White will probably answer by moving out in a way that may well give me a free opportunity to play around H16 and fix up that weak point.  In the meantime, I'll gain some territory eventually in the area below O13.

Plus, K4 is too close to white's strong corner.  White has invested a lot of moves there, so if you come too close, you'll get attacked.  If you're going to play on the lower side, better at least one line closer to the corner, to leave yourself room for an extension when white invades behind.  Actually I think the best spot on the lower side is N3.  But O13 is still my preffered move on the board as a whole.]
;W[np]C[Now white is really in trouble, with another weak group.  True, black K4 is a bit weak too (it would be better a little farther from white's strong corner).

This game is getting very complicated, with so many weak stones on the board.]
;B[pn]C[A good calm response.  Still the K4 stone looks hard to handle.  But the O4 stone is even harder.]
;W[nn];B[qb]C[R18 looks like the wrong direction to attack from (though attacking this group is a good idea).  Black needs to attack in a way that helps the K4 stone and hurts whites O4/O6 group.  So I still like O13.]
;W[ng]C[Note that white took the point that I think black wanted.]
;B[oh]C[Black is taking territory when he should be worrying about weak groups.  Sure, R18 and P12 get the upper right side fairly solidly.  But white will get much more than that by exploiting the weakness around H17 and the weak stone at K4.]
;W[lq]C[M3 is one idea, but I think attaching at Q3 first to get some footing, then capping at K6 to fight on a large scale, would be more fun.  Also the K6 stone would do more to help white's weak group in the top right, and to aim at the H17 weakness.]
;B[kq]C[L3 seems a bit heavy, thinking only of attacking white and not of black's own weakness.  H4 or K6 feel better to me.]
;W[hq]C[J3 would relate to M3 better, aiming at linking up with L2 later, but H3 is a fine safe move, taking territory while attacking.]
;B[lp];W[mq];B[oq]C[P3 is a fine move, keeping white weak to make the fight more fair.]
;W[mp]C[N4 is bad shape and doesn't look necessary.  Peep at L5, maybe, or jump to J6, black will probably play around L7, and then white can play O9, aiming at both Q8 and the black group on the bottom middle.]
;B[lo]C[M5 is a good answer to N4.  N4 is a bad move.];W[lm]
;B[jm]C[The N4/M5 exchange has helped black's shape a lot.]
;W[qj]C[White's attention span seems to be too short.  White should keep attacking, at G12, K9, H7, or maybe H17.  I don't know how to decide which of those is best, but make black worry about those weak groups!  I like G12 best because if that black group dies, it makes the hugest territory.  But on the other hand white has the weak groups on the top and bottom to worry about, so maybe a move strengthening them should come before the big attack.]
;B[oj]C[P10 seems strange to me.  Q9 feels more natural, or R9.  But if black is aiming at attacking the O17/15/13 group, then this move is pretty good.]
;W[qm]C[Black should let white live inside on the right side, and build up strength to attack on the outside.  Black can attack white's groups on the bottom and top (and thereby strengthen himself, too).]
;B[ol]C[Great move!  Q7 is maybe even better, but it's the same basic idea.  Let white live inside, get strong outside, and attack.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[on]C[Now black has to worry about life in the corner a bit, so it's a bit harder to attack.  Q7 would have been harder to cut than P8.]
;B[oo]C[P5 attacks harder but is weaker for life in the corner.  A tough trade-off to evaluate.  I would play R6, make life in the corner easier, make white worry about life on the right side a bit...]
;W[mn]C[Now P5 and M5 are left peeping at both sides of a bamboo joint, which is proverbially bad.  That is, now you would sure rather have P5 at Q5 or R6!  Think about where white will respond, and compare how much your move helps you with how much his move helps him.  In this case, with white so solidly out in the open, P5 isn't doing much work any more now that white responded sensibly.]
;B[qn]C[...and you played R6 anyway.  R6 is certainly better without the P5/N6 trade coming first.]
;W[qh]C[And white sensibly runs for life.];B[qk]C[And black attacks fiercely, good!]
;W[rj];B[ph]C[Q12 is a bit of a wimp move after the aggressive R9.  Also why not P13 instead of Q12, hurting the outside group a bit while the inside one lives (that is, supposing white will live, wouldn't you rather end up with a stone at P13 than Q12?)]
;W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[rm];W[qf];B[qe];W[rf];B[re];W[qg];B[of]
C[here's where you pay for not playing P13 earlier.  It costs you an extra move (white R13 becomes sente) and that means a lot in the fighting onthe rest of the board)]
;W[lk]C[White correctly leaves his group on the top side (you have invested a lot of extra moves there, such as R18, so he can afford to give up most of it) and focuses attention on the battle between the two weak groups on the bottom.  If white gets strong here, then a move around G12 could be very painful for black, as the bottom and left groups might both be in trouble.]
;B[jk];W[li];B[mh]C[If white gives up the whole top group there, it's only 30 points or so (though black also gets K16 as a strong stone instead of a weak one).  Black's groups are worth far more than that to white.  So white should just build up strength by sacrificing the top right group.  Even just M12 is good enough.]
;W[jj]C[Fine move by white.  I like the defiant attitude.];B[kj]
C[Black stirs things up.  Nice.];W[lj];B[kk];W[ki]C[Black has to connect to some friends, somewhere ... white is walling him off ...]
;B[ij];W[kf]C[Huh?  Black captures at K11 and has a live group which is pretty easy to connect to the C/E12 stones, too.  That would make the game easy for black, I think.]
;B[kg]C[Cutting and fighting is a good idea, but count the score first!  If you can win with K11, then just win.  K11 solves all your problems, because your groups become strong, so unless it puts you behind in territory, you should want to play K11 first, and fight after you have become safe.  I think the score is close enough that you can afford K11.]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[kh];B[jg];W[jh];B[jf];W[ih]C[White is going to have a hard time living in the top right if black plays O12.  But then, black may have trouble handling the C/E12 stones at this point.]
;B[mg]C[N13 is unnecessarily complicated.  Just connect at O12, you are completely safe then, so all the burden is on white.]
;W[gh]C[White wisely sacrifices the top for the time being, to go after black's weak groups.]
;B[gj];W[fi]C[White has to keep you cut, but the two stones on the left are getting pretty small now.  If white gets them, he has maybe 90 points.  If black plays something simple, like G8, and lives there (and captures the white stones at the top), black has about the same.  Interesting.]
;B[ll]C[Black tries to cut off the weak white stones at the bottom, but it can't work; white just plays N8 atari, then N9 connects.  Black should play around G8, to live while reducing white's prospects on the left side.]
;W[ml];B[kl];W[nk];B[dj]C[Black is trying to save his stones.  That's going to make the game complicated.  I think black can afford to give them up, play F10 etc. to make white swallow them on a small scale.]
;W[dk];B[fj];W[ei];B[ej]C[White lets black have his way!  I think white D9 should be at F10.]
;W[di];B[cj];W[dh];B[bh]C[B12 is big on the left side, but there's still bigger stuff (e.g. defending at H16, capturing at M14 to make sure white dies there, or O2 at the bottom)]
;W[cg]C[Why did white play C13?  I don't see what it gains.]
;B[bg]C[B13 also looks quite small.];W[bf]C[B13-B14 seems like a trade that loses black points.  Can't black just start at B14 right away?]
;B[bk];W[bl];B[ak]C[A9 is a mistake.  It loses points compared to B10 or A8 (A8 leads to a ko, after white B9-black A10; a dangerous ko in this situation, so B10 is correct I think).]
;W[al]C[Now white stll threatens B10, so A9-A8 exchange just helped white defend the side.]
;B[dm];W[cm];B[ek];W[bj];B[ci]C[White captures in sente, so an outright loss for black here.]
;W[fn];B[gm]C[Black may need G7 for life, which shows yet again how important B10 was.]
;W[hc]C[White can pick up a lot of points in the top left here.  I don't see black being very likely to save those two stones.]
;B[hd];W[jc];B[kd];W[gd];B[gc]C[Black is magnifying his loss by adding G17 to the two dead stones.  Just give them up (and maybe capture K17 while you're at it)]
;W[id];B[he];W[ie];B[hf];W[if];B[hg];W[ig];B[lf];W[hh]C[White gained a TON of points here, and black got nothing.]
;B[hb];W[ic];B[fd];W[ge];B[ee];W[ff];B[ef];W[fg];B[ed];W[eg]
C[this is unnecessary for white.  Now black may live!];B[dc]
;W[cd];B[cb];W[ib];B[be];W[ce]C[White might want to try B18 here, to see if the top group can die.  C15 doesn't gain much at all, and makes bad shape.]
;B[af];W[cf]C[Since black is already alive, C14 is not all that big ... well, ASSUMING white can kill black at the top.]
;B[bc];W[bd];B[ab];W[ae]C[Since black is alive on both sides, white A15 is small.]
;B[lr]C[This is the wrong direction.  Black has territory on the right, not the left.  So black should play O2.]
;W[mr];B[jr];W[ps]C[Black loses territory on this exchange (M/K2 for N2/Q1).]
;B[pr];W[os];B[or]C[P2 should be O1.  White captures O1, but R1 becomes an atari, so white doesn't go any farther into the corner.]

;W[oe];B[pe];W[mf];B[nf];W[od];B[md]C[White is wasting a lot of ko threats, trying to save a dead group.]
;W[gb];B[fb]C[This is big!  Black will need to make some moves to live up here.  Black should have aimed at this area sooner (connecting at G18 himself)]
;W[gn];B[hn];W[ho];B[in];W[hr];B[em]C[Isn't G19 still pretty big? Seems larger than this, anyway.]
;W[en];B[io];W[fm];B[fl];W[gl];B[hm];W[kn];B[sg]C[Hm, this seems like an overplay for black, but maybe black has read it out and sees that white will die here?  If not, G19 is much better.  Only play a move like this if you can see it all the way through to white's certain death.  Otherwise, put it off -- then, even if white spends a move, at least you haven't given away free points.]
;W[sf];B[si]C[T11 shows a good sense for the key points.  If any move is going to work, this is the one.]
;W[ri]C[This seems wrong.  Widening the eye space with T8 should be the first fundamental here.  I think white lives after T8 (since it threatens to make an eye at T10)]
;B[sl]C[T8 is the key move for black, too.  Plus, even if white still manages to live, it's worth a lot of points because it prevents white's T7 atari later.]
;W[sh];B[rh]C[And white dies.  Wow!  T8 sure was the key to this one.  And the good sense at T11 too.]
;W[rg];B[sh];W[sj];B[sh];W[ip];B[iq];W[jo];B[hp]C[Black had better be careful to get two eyes for this group after the mistake around B10.  All black needs to do is live here, and it's an easy victory (count the points! Black has a huge right side)and don't forget about all those dead white stones on the side and top right too.]

;W[cl];B[km];W[ln];B[ag];W[ad]C[The game should be over with an easy win for black.  Just make sure of life for the big group!  A11 makes an eye at A12, or a move in the center somewhere.  Don't take any chances!  G19 is also good, taking some profit while guaranteeing life for that group.]
