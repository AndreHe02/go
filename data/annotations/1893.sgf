AB[pd][dp]C[Hi:

My name is Jesus and I am a Spanish 3K.In this game I feel I played a terrible fuseki, so I did not have a chance. My handicap advantage disapeared really soon, could you help me and tell me where is my mistake?

I use to be lost at the begining of the middle game. I would really appreciate it if you could help me regarding this.

Thank you.

Kind regards:
Jesus];W[dd];B[pq];W[qo];B[op];W[pn];B[kq]C[J: p6, p7, o6... seems to be joseki.

Per: Your move is ok.];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]C[J: B has allowed W to make this good move, protecting both W groups. Maybe a pincer was called for, instead of o17.

Per: This sequense is also good for black. Since you get sente to play C14. I belive this is an equal result.]
;B[cf]C[Per: Good sense of direction.  The left side is most important now.]
;W[dj]C[Per:
When choosing blacks next move it is important to remeber that the left side is more important than the top. Blacks low stone at O17 makes it difficult for both sides to make points at the top.

In this situation black has three options:
1. Enter the corner at C17  2. Pincer around F16 or F17
3. Split white in two with E14

In my opinion option three looks best.]
(;B[cc]C[J: f17 first and then san-san was better

Per: Look at my previous comment];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be]
;B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[cn];B[fp];W[ge]C[J: Ok, so the middle game has begun. What to do now? I feel really lost at this point of the game. What should I be thinking about in this moment? By the
 way, where has my handicap advantage gone?

Per: First of all your handicap advantage is still there.
You shouldn't be decieved by white large framework. It can easily be invaded.

Now let's return to blacks next move. The main focus right now is white's attempt to make a moyo on the left side. Black can either reduce it with E7 or invade at C8.
I would choose the invasion. The main reason is that black L3 is low and makes it easy for white to invade blacks moyo even after black plays E7 and O6.]

(;B[nn]C[J e7 first, then W d8 B o6 was better. h16 is a big point too.

Per: Yes, this is blacks first major mistake];W[en];B[pk]C[J: Overplay. q10 was better, it is a reducing move.

Per: This is not an overplay. Allthough I would have prefered to play G6]
;W[nm]C[Per: Black must not step away for a fight here. See variation for one possible way to fight back.]

(;B[mm];W[nl];B[gn]C[Per: This is big but you can't step away from the fight. Black should play Q11 too strengthen the Q9 stone]
;W[ni];B[rp]C[J: Bad, it threatens nothing. B4 or h16 are better.]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[gl];B[bp]C[Per: Black should complete the se
quence by playing F6 and P6 first.];W[mn];B[ln];W[mo];B[on]
;W[om];B[mp]C[J: Bad, very bad.];W[oo];B[lo];W[no];B[cl]C[Per: This is an overplay]
;W[bo];B[cj];W[ci];B[dk]C[J: What would you play here instead of d9?

Per: I would play H16];W[bj];B[bk];W[ck]C[J: It is a difficult ko for B (2 steps)]
;B[rn]C[J: If it was a real ko threat, it would be too small, no W's group life is in danger. But it is not even a threat.]
;W[cj];B[ql]C[J: s8 would be a bit better, at least it would protect against  s5, t5, s7.]
