;B[pd]C[benni: My name is Benni Bärmann and i am a 1 kyu from germany. I hope i have some useful hints for you.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[ed];B[cc]C[this move I was unsure about, I don't know the joseki dealing with white moving diagonally from komoku...and I feel like this move is too weak.

benni: yes, the normal answer is a extension along the side.]
;W[dg];B[cf]C[Another move that I think is slow, but I didn't want to do another one-point jump...feeling that that would leave my stones too weak.

benni: i had played d14 to get in the middle or get more of the side. the main point here is not to be surrounded in the corner]
;W[df];B[cg];W[dh];B[fq]C[benni: you should take the big point around k17. it is a perfect extension from whites wall. if white does get thios point it is to big.]
;W[hp];B[dr];W[fp];B[cq];W[cp];B[gq];W[jd]C[At this point I don't think black looks good...

benni: black has more secure territory, but this is maybe not enough against whites influence.]
;B[pj]C[benni: good move. you take influence to counter whites strength. but maybe c11 is bigger. if white plays c12 he gets a huge moyo.]
;W[nc];B[ne];W[ld];B[md]C[this next sequence of moves doesn't seem quite right.

benni: aji-keshi];W[mc];B[le];W[ke];B[lf];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
;B[jq]C[benni: again: c11 is more acute, i think.];W[pm];B[ql]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[qq]C[I was expecting to get ripped to pieces by a crosscut and ensueing fighting...but things went my way...]

;B[kr];W[mq];B[lo];W[kh];B[kg];W[jg];B[lh]C[I seem to have just done the same slack moves (I think) that I did with this same group above

benni: yes. aji-keshi again. it is not the time to make secure territory in such small amounts for both sides when a big move like c12/c11 is on the board]
;W[ki];B[li];W[kf];B[eo]C[It seems the peep helped white more than black...]
;W[ep];B[cl];W[dm];B[dl];W[em];B[el];W[fm];B[hq];W[ci];B[bn]
;W[bq];B[bj];W[bi];B[bh];W[cj];B[bk];W[aj];B[ah]C[first of all, I misread this. Second of all, I think I just created a weaker group. Should it have been at a13? Or just left alone?

benni: you should try to make a second eye in the center with you weak group (which is allready difficult). you should not weeken your own group with exchanges like a12/a11.]

;B[cn];W[dn];B[sc];W[ko];B[im];W[ae]C[this move doesn't really do anything..no one gains more points correct?... I should have just passed beyond this (instead of playing r18)

benni: it gains one point if white weins the ko, because white take one more stone than black.]
