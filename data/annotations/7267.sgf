[di][dj]C[J: Weird! The marked points are important for both sides.  Black can grow a nice moyo.  White can stem that growth.]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[pr]MA[mq][oo]C[I am not quite sure how to respond to these moves, but I am certain of that white did not play a normal joseki.

I played at Q2 because I didn't want to play at q3, empty triangle no good :p

The result seemed fine.

J: yeah, white is at a disadvantage, but black seems a bit submissive.  Black can't let white have influence on both sides. Mark points show a fighting spirit.]

;W[qn];B[rm]C[J: O4 now.];W[np]C[I should probably play this before white ;(

J: yes, this is bad, but not the end of the world...];B[oo]
C[It was in my interested that my living black group brok through and kept the two groups seperated.

J: Yes, but only enough to keep them separated.  The more you run, the stronger both sides get.]

;W[qi];B[pk]C[J: I'ts to early to be so fixated at this group. You're not really making territory by threatening it.]
;W[nl];B[rj]C[J: Endgame move.];W[ri];B[pm]C[I do this because it is better that he jsut got 4 libs, than 5 :)]
;W[pn];B[ml];W[nk];B[lm]C[afriad of cut

J: ok.];W[hq]C[J: Feels low.];B[cj]C[Simply extending

J: Good timing.];W[cl];B[fi]LB[nd:C][cn:B][ej:A]C[This move makes a nice box of territory.

J: Yes, but easy to invade and puts no pressure on white. A does the same and aims at B.  C also a possibility to keep white down.]
;W[cg]C[This is was a move I that I expected, my plan was to just a nice corner, and cut this potential c13 stone, and make it a weak group

J: ah, and theres the invasion.];B[df]C[J: feels like the wrong direction, since you're pushing white towards you weaker side.]
;W[dg];B[cf];W[eg];B[ef];W[fg];B[di];W[ff];B[fe];W[hf];B[ge]
;W[gf]MA[hh]C[J: bad shape for white, mark instead, still connected and threatens to put pressure on F11.]
;B[he];W[jc];B[hc]MA[je][ie]C[J: once again too submissive. Black should keep white separate.]
;W[md]C[J: too good for white.];B[ek]C[J: slow, should make use of weak white H14.]
;W[em];B[mj]C[Perhaps it was better to squeeze him out, instead of squeezing him in. I failed to stop connection with r11 stones.]
;W[nj];B[ni]C[J: still too early to attack that group, you're creating cutting points now.]

(;B[mi]C[Might be a little pasive, I am not sure.];W[pi];B[mg]

;B[og];W[pf];B[of];W[oe];B[mf];W[me];B[if]C[I though I was winning at this point. I was going to use g14 as a punchbag for getting more territory. Also, I would like to make my corner group come into the middle.

J: wrong direction because of F11 group.];W[hh];B[ig];W[hj]
C[I felt like I should've give my group at d11 more thought here.]
;B[gk];W[ik];B[hg];W[gh];B[gm]C[J: correct direction  now.]

;W[fn];B[fo];W[gj];B[fj];W[el];B[fl];W[hl];B[dk]C[J: black is alive now.]
;W[gl];B[ke];W[kd];B[jd];W[ld];B[le]C[I just say "fine, you make wall, I make wall"  thinking this was ok for me. This was going to get me some territory in the middle. Not as much he is going to get at the top probably, but I didn't think I could do much about that anyway.

J: true, so don't play moves that  end in gote.];W[ic];B[id]
;W[ho];B[bh];W[bg];B[bk];W[bl];B[al];W[am];B[ak];W[kl]C[J: White cannot ignore that cut.]

;W[lb]C[J: L17 instead. Last comment, thanks for showing me this game.  So the take away from this game is don't be too submissive, and choose the right time to use other's weaknesses.]

All in all, I am pleased with the game :) Although I feel like I won the game because mu opponent did some weird mistakes.

For the one reading this, thank you very much for reviewing this. :)]
