C[Llywelyn: I ended up losing this game by 7.5 points after throwing away the NE corner and botching solidifying myself through the middle. I'm a bit rusty, and any help or advice is appreciated.]

C[Llywelyn: I figured I could live locally in here, but in retrospect it seems to give too much influence.  Is it still a good ide ato come in here?

MR: I think that this is overdoing things. My first impulse would have been P11. If Black follows with O9, you can still invade the bottom. If Black invests another move at the bottom right corner, you have a rather save group installed on the right side and can check the top with M17. Also, the bottom is not all secure territory for Black then.]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq];W[ql]C[Llywelyn: I was going for light play, would something more solid have been appropriate?
MR: No, you do have to play lightly here, because you invaded in an area where black was strong to begin with. However, R8 seems strange shape to me. You cannot cut black and it seems that you do not have time to answer black R10 with white Q11. As there is hardly enough space for two eyes at the edge, I would prefer to develop to the center. I would consider P4, P6, or O5.]
;B[po];W[pn];B[oo];W[ro];B[on];W[pm];B[qj];W[dj]C[MR: This is a large move, but it looks to me like "wanting too much". You have two small and unsecured groups on the right side. I would want to save at least one of them. Also, R8 aimed at attacking the black stones around S10. One idea would be to keep them separated from the rest of the black troops with P7. With respect to shape, black R10 asks for white Q11.]
;B[pi];W[qc];B[qd];W[rf]C[Llywelyn: I don't know what I was thinking here.  Should have run with N14, lived in the corner with Q18,  approached at M17, or done something else entirely?
MR: Yepp, several good ideas. At least, you will not be able to connect the stones around R14 with the corner, so S14 only makes them heavier and makes it more difficult to live for R17.]

C[MR: This move seems to say "ok, catch the stones on the right side, while I build my area on the left side".]
;B[qh];W[nf]C[MR: ... but this move appears to be inconsistent in relation to K17. It creates a group to attack, and black can destroy the white influence on the left side while attacking.]

;B[nc];W[mc];B[mh]C[MR: The result from the local fight is better than to be expected for you. 
However, it seems a bit silly that you invested stones at O14 and O12.]
;W[jj]C[Llywelyn: This turned out to be a bad decision.
MR: Playing a stone in this area is not a bad idea, as both black and white can expand their area of influence here.]
;B[jh];W[ig]C[MR: J13 and the following moves *turn* K10 into a bad move. They strengthen black and allow him to cut off the white stone at K10. As black cannot capture K10 with one move, I would tend to strengthen the top white corner with D14 or C15 instead.]
;B[ih];W[hg];B[hh];W[gg];B[hj];W[il]C[MR: Strange shape. I would play from a distance like H3 or H4.]
;B[ei]C[MR: Now, white should see that there will not be much territory in the middle left, so he might want to secure the top left corner or still play at the bottom.]
;W[di];B[eh];W[dg];B[cc]C[MR: Good for black.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce]
;B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc];B[ik]C[MR: Another moment for white to rethink about his strategy. White should try not to allow black to take the whole center as territory. On the other hand, white should try to convert as much as possible from the left bottom side into white territory and should try to get some territory on the bottom side. 

In the upcoming middle game fight I have the feeling that both players forget about their main goals every now and then ...]

(;W[fk]C[Llywelyn: In retrospect would D9 have been better for me?
MR: Why not C8?
Black can only cut apart living white groups. After white C8, I have no clue where black wants to create two eyes with that group!
Even if you play L8 first, it is very difficult for black to manage to live with his bottom left group.]

[lr][pr][qr][is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[MR: 
I think that you lost the game with allowing the black group to live on the left bottom side.

The first thing that went strange in the game was the implementation of the two weak white groups on the right side. Maybe, you should think about securing one group first before you start installing the second group. 

Then, it seemed that you could not really decide between allowing black to capture your top white group or securing it. Maybe you should try in your next games to make the strategic decision first and then to follow through over the next couple of moves (even if you are insecure whether the decision was "correct").  

Of course, you should have killed the black stones on the lower left after investing all the white stones in that area before. You were not much afraid about your groups on the right side in the beginning of the game, so why did you react that submissively on the left side?]

(;W[mp]C[MR: If you really want to cut off the K4 group, you need to connect here. But a difficult fight will develop that most likely is desasterous for one side or the other.]
