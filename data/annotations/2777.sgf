C[icepick:  I played Black.   I have done a brief analysis of this game, pointing out things that I missed during the game.

Thank you for taking the time to review my game and comments.

csh: I hope you find this review helpful.];B[qd];W[cp];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[ep];W[cn]LB[dn:A][gq:B]C[csh: This is sort of an odd move, too. Usually A or B are played directly.]

(;B[en]LB[cq:A][iq:B]C[csh: Actually, I don't like this move so much. I'd prefer to give my group a base, by playing either A or somewhere in the vicinity of B.]
;W[gq]C[csh: The pincer is an attacking move. Now the black stones do not have a base. It now becomes a battle between the black group and the two white groups (one on either side.)]

(;B[er]LB[jq:B][er:A]C[I think that this was a suboptimal move, attaching a C3 would have been better.   Perhaps even an extention from the lower right, around L3 or so.

csh: I do like C3 better. This move does, however, keep the two white groups separated, so it's not too bad. Look at the variations.]
;W[nq]
(;B[pn]C[This is a case where a habitual response was wrong.   Better I think to have played at K3 or L3 and split the two White stones.   Q6 allows White a safe lower side.

csh: I don't think this move is "wrong." This move concentrates on constructing territory along the righthand side instead of trying to destroy territory that White is trying to make. See the variation.]
;W[jq]C[csh: This move is a little flat.  K4 would be better. Note that you have a weakness to aim for at M3 later.]
;B[oc]C[csh: This is a nice move that constructs a lot of potential territory.]

(;W[pj]C[csh: This invasion might be better at R11 to get a base along the righthand side.]
;B[ph]C[csh: Good. Put pressure on the stone while starting to build territory on the right.]
;W[pf]C[csh: This move is sort of odd. White has split himself apart with your stone.]

(;B[og]LB[qf:B][nh:A]C[csh: I'm not sure what the purpose of this move is. If you are trying to run to the center to split the two groups, maybe A is better. If you are trying to connect, maybe B is better. See the variations.]
;W[ne];B[md]C[csh: This move is also a good idea. It puts pressure on the two running white stones, and also makes territory along the top.]
;W[jd];B[cf];W[gd]
(;B[bd]LB[cc:A][ci:B]C[C11 or C10 would have been better I think.

csh: This move looks proper to me. A or B become miai for life.]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[mf]LB[le:A]TR[og][ph]C[csh: After White plays here, immediately I looked at A to cut off his group. Your two marked stones aren't safe, though, so that's a bigger problem.]

(;B[of]C[csh: So I think this is the correct move, to just settle your stones and get a little profit.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[le];B[cj]LB[ch:A]C[csh: The problem with this move is that there is a weakness at A that White can exploit later.]
;W[bl]LB[ch:A]TR[ph][of][og]SQ[pj]C[csh: At this point in the game, I think you need to look at your groups. How safe are they? Which ones are under attack?
 You should look at the white groups and ask the same questions.

My feeling is that the black group in the upper right is safe. It should live with minimum hassle. I also think the three marked stones should connect back to the corner, even if White tries to pull out his cutting stone.

The black group in the upper left is relatively safe, but there might be mischief if White tries to at A.

The black groups in the bottom left and bottom right don't really have eyespace, so I think they worry me the most.

I made a couple variations here, where White gets first move, so that you can see how those two groups might be attacked.

White's groups, on the other hand, look more or less connected.  The group in the upper left looks safe, as does his group at the bottom. I also think the lower left should live.

In fact, I think the only stone under pressure is the one I marked with the square. White just needs to run it out to safety.]

(;B[nj];W[ol];B[pl];W[pk];B[ok];W[pm];B[ql];W[om];B[qm];W[qq]

(;B[pq]LB[qp:A]C[csh: In this case, I think you are blocking from the wrong side. The wall you get from blocking this way is useless, because the white group is pretty safe. A would be better.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[nr];B[os];W[ro];B[rn]

(;W[rq]
(;B[np];W[mq];B[go]C[csh: Good. You were the first one to get back to this area. Did you think that the black group in the lower left was alive? Or just that it was just in less trouble than the one on the lower right?]
;W[oo];B[po];W[mo];B[nn];W[ml];B[mm];W[nk];B[oj];W[mj];B[on]
;W[nl];B[mh];W[mi];B[ni]C[O12 would have been better, connecting both the N12 stone, and the 3 stones below.

csh: I agree. This is just ugly shape.];W[nh];B[oi]
(;W[lh];B[ef]LB[ch:A]C[csh: This move actually protects agains the invasion at A. However, the lower left is still more important.]
;W[de];B[df];W[cc];B[dl]C[csh: Whew! Now the lower left is loosely connected to the group on the left. It is a lot more stable than before.]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[ck];B[dj];W[cr];B[jo];W[fr];B[fq];W[gr];B[gp]

C[csh: With this capture, your lower left group, your lower right group, and the group on the left are all connected. You don't have any weak groups to worry about anymore.

But what about his groups? The one I'd worry about the most is the lower right. Again, let's look to see what will happen if you have first move.]

(;W[jj];B[hj];W[gf];B[fh];W[hh]LB[bc:A]C[csh: In the endgame, moves around the edges are worth more than those in the center. It's deceptive, but a move like A is worth quite a lot.]
;B[ii];W[gi];B[jg]C[csh: Better to just stay connected.];W[ih]

;W[lq];B[kq];W[jr]
(;B[kp]C[Too cautious, L2 I think would have captured the right hand half of White's group.

csh: I play L2 in a variation. I don't know if you count the board (while still playing) to see who's ahead and who's behind. If you are behind, you should look for a more aggressive move to try and get back in the game. If you can't read it out, and you are ahead, then solid play is best.]

[sc][sd][rl][rm][sl][sm]C[csh: Overall, a good game.

Your strengths:

- You did better than you opponent in the endgame.
- You tend to tenuki (play elsewhere) when the local plays became less valuable. This gave you the advantage in many situations.

Things to work on:

- Life and death. You should have been able to attack the lower right corner more effectively. That would have been over a 20 point swing, even more than the tesuji on the lefthand side.
- Judging the relative strength of the both the white and black groups. Strengthen your weak groups, and attack his weak groups.

I hope you find this review helpful. Good luck!])
