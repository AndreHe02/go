C[Hello!

My name is Bernd, I am HonFu in the GTL and on KGS. This review starts with a "prologue", but in-game comments will be shorter.

Extremely spoken there are two types of go players: those who do not defend but attack, and those who defend but also let their opponent defend. In the games of the former large scale battles happen, and rarely a game is not resigned - normally there is an early K.O. In the games of the latter every group immediately lives, and it all ends in a close score decision.

Both styles have risks. The fighting style is full of mines - every move can be the last and requires ready reading and tesuji. The territory style normally leads to close games, so you always carry the burden that the game might end with 0,5 points against you. 

In this game you seem to me like a territorial player, who defends his groups early rather than take sente and go for an attack. No group dies, but in the end you lose on points. So for you to win games like this it is crucial that you can judge the size, the territorial value, of every move properly. In this review I will try to help you develop this skill a bit.

First I give you a simple system how to evaluate moves. 1.) Big moves - moves that enlarge your potential AND at the same time reduce the potential of the opponent. 2.) Medium moves - moves that enlarge your own potential but don't affect the opponent's potential. 3.) Small moves - moves that reduce opponent's potential while not doing anything for increasing your own.

The big moves are big, because they profit you two-way - increasing yourself and shrinking the opponent means double value. In the medium moves you only have your own position in the focus. Normally you end in gote and your opponent can take control. I call the small moves small, because they affect only one side (this time the opponent's side) AND because they include the constant fear that your reducing force (for example an invading stone) will be attacked, squeezed to a small valueless group, or even killed.

In this review I will try to evaluate every of your decisions using this system. 

(Remarks regarding shape, general fighting or whatever will be in brackets since they don't belong to the main line of this review.)]

;B[dj];W[ed];B[hd]C[Here is the first crosspath, where you can decide how to answer the pincer, and how you want to play on later. 

If you look at the board, then the right side looks very big, since both hoshi stones want to develop towards the other. There you would want to play later, if you get the chance. The upper side might become big if you manage to split the top stones effectively and start an attack. The lower side is already quite solid and not so big now, since the lower left is so solid. Black is solid on the left side, so that area is also not as important as the right or upper side.

(An important principle: "Stay away from strong/living groups")

Playing "small" now would mean only playing for reduction without building something up for yourself (territory, influence, an attack). Just living quickly would not be a lot of trouble for your opponent - "medium". What would be "big" then?]

(;W[ce]C[In the game you chose to make shape quickly by attaching - a measure for emergencies. Here it was a bit too hasty. Also you aim for the left side, which is not all that important.]
;B[be];W[dd];B[cc];W[cf];B[eb];W[bf];B[bd];W[ef];B[fc]C[As an end result you now have a group which has reduced the left side, where black already has a solid group without problems. The whole corner (always big) falls to black, and black was able to connect towards H16. Invading the upper side now has no attacking effect, since black is strong, but would be "small" - that is, merely reducing.

In this exchance white is worse: his group has no points and no attacking value or growth potential, it ended up as a group merely reducing the left side. Anyway, the game is far from over, and white has sente. Where is the "big" point now?]

(;W[nc]C[Wrong side!

This would be called a "small" move from the earlier explanation: you invade and only destroy enemy potential without increasing your own. You will get a small group here with few points. In the end position of the game you will see, that this group holds almost no points.

(Since the upper left black group is already alive and strong, you hurt the principle "Stay away from living/strong groups".)]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[So now you got a second group which has no further potential and has just reducing value. Black's group in the upper right has just started to develop on the more valuable (open and wide) right side. And black has sente!]
;B[qn]C[Now we see that you have a small group without growth potential at the top, while black faces the open right side. He can increase his potential by attacking your Q4 stone.]
;W[nq];B[pl];W[jp]C[So it all ended up that you played on the left side, which was small to start with (since black was already strong there), and on the upper side, where black was also strong, when you started to play there. The lower side is not as big as it looks, since F3 is low, O3 is low, and you still have gaps at H3, M3 and R3. Furthermore it is your only real moyo.]
;B[rp];W[pi]C[I understand your invasion here. If you don't play here, your opponent may take the point and the whole right is black then. Since the lower side seems more open than the right side then, it seems as if white could get into territory trouble - especially since both the upper right group and the upper left group don't hold real points.

Here we already see the results of taking the small, merely reducing points: You made your opponent take the more valuable space on the right side while taking the valueless upper side for yourself. So now you feel behind and you feel the need to invade - which unfortunately is another "small" move: only reducing, negative by definition, with the danger of a strong attack. You just created your 3rd valueless group.]

;W[qg];B[qb]C[You stepped back move by move here, but finally you have a shape that can live. It's only natural that you don't get an attractive result here, since you were an invader between strong enemy groups. You ended up with a group that is still weakish and is not holding points or influence. 

Furthermore now we also see, that the upper group, placed on a small place to begin with, has almost no points now, since black is threatening P18. 

"Small" moves did produce "small" groups of only reducing value. Now your only group really holding points is the lower side, which is still open to invasion, while black has safe points in several places.]

[sp][sq][rr][sr][qs][rs][ss]C[If we now look at what your groups do, how many points they hold, then we see that your three "negative" groups - the groups which were just "small" reducing forces - have all shrinked to nothingness. All three groups taken together only hold 16 points! Your only real territory is on the bottom side.

Black has a large territory in the center which you failed to reduce in time. In the places where you were happy with mere "small" reducing groups, he squeezed you small while still keeping points for himself.

So by starting early with the decision to reduce rather than to build up yourself AND reducing at the same time (taking the big points) you got into the chain reaction of always having to reduce the new black potential, creating new "small" groups.
Then, two crucial moments, you allowed him combined center influence, and then you chose the wrong side - bottom right, not bottom left - and allowed black to solidify a huge center territory.

I would recommend to watch out for those things by asking yourself in your own games at every move, which are the "big" moves (both sides affected), the "medium" (only your side) and the "small" (only his side + danger), always with the idea of creating and destroying potential.

Getting a clear perception of the size of areas and moves should make you a better territorial player!]
)
(;B[hm]C[... and then it's game over.

This move is a "medium" move - only protecting black points without affecting white - but in this situation it is the only move, because it makes black's large territory safe with one strike. Sometimes a "medium" move can be biggest!]
))
(;W[hm]C[... but if you take the last open road into his moyo ...]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[io];W[jo];B[ip]C[... he also has easy access to your bottom territory for a revenge. And you are only reducing him, not making any points for yourself - "medium". If you get cut off, then it will be a "small" move.

But I think, destroying his moyo is urgent. It just gets too large an area otherwise.]
))
(;W[fn]C[This would be the area you should play, aiming to shrink his moyo AND increase your own. 

"Big" move!];B[nn]C[Now if black took this point on the right side, you can clearly see that his area doesn't improve so much.

So this place is a "medium" place, whoever plays here affects only one side (your side), since black has not got a lot of potential here to start with.]

(;W[fo]C[This would be a better "medium" territorial move.

But whichever side you defend, here or the right side, black can still come in, if he really wants.]

(;W[di];B[ei]C[(... that after the natural exchange black gets to "hane at the end of two stones" first. So by playing a move like C11, you doom yourself to the fate of getting bad shape.

Diagonal approach is only from above - hitting a stone on the 3rd line from the 4th!)]

(;W[gf]C[(Splitting black now looks good to me. 

The top group can still live, while his stones are insecure in the center.)]
))
(;W[ni]C[... and jump out.

Still - this move has no real value, it is only defensive. No influence, no points. Yet it is necessary because black would attack you otherwise. Again we see the results of playing a strategy based on taking the "small" points.]

I would do that at least.

But maybe I want to kill too much? ^^)]))
(;W[qf]C[Here! 

It is most reasonable to develop your own position while reducing your opponent's position. This move is the big one!]

C[You make him take the left side, which is already solid anyway. Black gets a modest territory on the left side, while you build influence toward the areas that are of greater value.]
