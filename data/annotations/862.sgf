C[Dear Mark,

here is the review of your game. When reading it, please
take into account that I am not a really strong player, so some of my
advice might be incorrect.

However, I hope that some of my comments will be of value to you. I
think that the main reasons for your losing this game were:

1) Failure to attack the weak groups of your opponent at the proper
time, or at all.

2) Putting too much importance on saving some of your own unimportant
stones.   3) Failure to invade your opponent's corner at the right time. Big moyos
(which your opponent would get after your invasion) are nothing to be
afraid of, as they can be reduced (or invaded) effectively.   The game commentary points out when and where the abovementioned
strategic mistakes came into play.

-paavo];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]C[This is the most boring opening style. Try the 3-3,3-4, 3-5 and 4-5 -points for variety.]
;B[qj]C[The black stone is too low considering the star-point stones. White will be able to play a reducing move around P10 later on.]
;W[dj]C[White sanrensei is not too common. This is because black usually dominates the opening and making a mirror image just assures that you will always be one move behind. An approach move is an option here. (O17,O16)]
;B[fc];W[db]C[This move is used to protect the corner. However, here it is not a good idea because the sanrensei is best used for building large moyos and walls ie. gaining power in the opening. This move also does not have too much effect on the black stone. More usual replies are D14, H17 and J16.]
;B[ce]C[Black is trying to invade the opening (D16-D10) The ugliness of this black move is beyond description. It could be seen as a trick play of some sort.]
;W[de]C[This is correct, splitting the black stones apart is essential.]
;B[cf];W[fe]C[Also good. F15 is a vital point for power in the center. Now neither of the black groups have good prospects.]
;B[ic]
(;W[nq]C[Leaving the left side as it is may or may not be reasonable. This move is good in the sense of quick development.]
;B[lq]
(;W[no]C[This is often played but I personally dislike it because it gives black too much. See variation for the more sensible alternative.]
;B[pn]
(;W[lo]C[A Shoulder hit at L14 is the more usual move here. See variation.]
;B[iq]
(;W[fq]C[This move does not really protect the corner and does not really attack the black stones either. A move at G3 is better. See variation.]
;B[ci]C[Black is trying to live with these stones. It is possible, but poor strategy. Black has too many weak groups.]
;W[cj];B[nm]
(;W[qq]C[This invasion will be cut apart from the O3 -stones. If you want to protect them, play either Q2 or Q3.]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq]
(;W[qp]C[S5 is better.];B[qo];W[ro];B[rn]C[Here you should play either S4 or T4. If you play S4, P1 becomes sente. If you play T4, T6 becomes sente. I recommend S4 in this case.]
;W[so];B[sn];W[rq];B[mp]C[This is only to be expected since you left these stones alone. The black stones are now strong because they can connect underneath.]
;W[lp];B[mq];W[mo];B[np];W[oo];B[po];W[kq];B[kp];W[jp];B[ko]
C[Black misses the ladder.];W[kn];B[kr];W[jq];B[jr];W[ip]C[This is good for white. Black has not gained too much.]
;B[lc]C[Black is making real territory at the top. This would be the time to invade at R17. The black stones at the top are no longer weak.]
;W[qe]C[This is not a good move. It lacks both mobility and stability. R17 is infinitely better.]
;B[qd]
(;W[qh]C[Making a base like this in a too narrow place is not too good. You should rather move out lightly, like with O14.]
;B[qf]
(;W[pe]C[This is too heavy. You must expect to lose a part of your stones in a tight spot like this. Q14 or S14 would look more like it.]
;B[re];W[pf];B[pg];W[qg];B[rf];W[og];B[oe];W[of];B[ne];W[nf]
;B[me];W[mf]C[Now your stones may be together but black has gained a big uninvadable territory at the top and you have gained nothing except a heavy group of stones. This is because you wanted to save all of your stones at the right side.]
;B[hq];W[ri]C[This is useless and small.];B[nj];W[oi];B[oj]
;W[hp]C[You are forcing black to invade or reduce the lower left by making this move.]
;B[cn]C[This is possibly too deep. The lower left corner is open so it might be justified.]
;W[cp]C[This is good. Now the corner is secure and the black stone is alone.]
;B[fp]C[Black is seeking safety.];W[gq];B[eo]C[This is not good. A lighter move such as F6 is better.]
;W[ep];B[fo];W[bl]C[That sequence seemed to work with this opponent. Now he is heavy-ish and without eyes.]
;B[hn]
(;W[jo]C[This is not absolutely necessary. See variation.];B[dl]
C[Black is making shape. Because he has 2 weak groups at the left, you should make your own stones solid and wait patiently for a chance to attack either. He can not take adequate care of both at the same time.]
;W[bi]C[B16 would be better. If black attacks the D10 -stones, white can simply move out and he will be safe because he has only one weak group and black two.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[dc];B[bc];W[gp]C[This is perhaps making things too safe. Best saved as an option for later.]
;B[df];W[di];B[dh];W[ch];B[cg];W[eh];B[dg];W[bg];B[bf];W[ef]
;B[cb];W[eg]C[White should be very happy. Black is giving in, maybe counting on his big territory at the top? White now has the thickness to attack the E5 -stones very severely, so black must defend them. Black's upper left corner is not too healthy either.]
;B[fk];W[af];B[be];W[ab]C[This is lethal. Black should have played a forcing move at A13 at some point.]
;B[ba];W[ac];B[da]
(;W[ea]C[This is a blunder. E18 is the only move.];B[eb];W[ca]
;B[sr];W[sq];B[da];W[qn];B[fa];W[qm]C[This is a reasonable compensation for the disaster at the upper left. Black only gained points but this has some (if little) meaning towards the center.]
;B[pm];W[ql];B[pk];W[qk];B[lf];W[lg];B[kf];W[kg];B[jg];W[jh]
;B[ig];W[ih]C[Now black has gained a huge territory at the top. This could have been prevented by 1) attacking the F17 -stones much earlier in the game. 2) Not trying to save all of your stones at the right side. 3) Invading the upper right corner instead if approaching it.]
;B[ei]C[Black does not need to do this since he has already won.]

(;W[pr];B[qq];W[lp];B[kq];W[mq]C[This way white will never have a problem with this group. This has also reinforced black, so it is not the best choise but the safest.]
))
(;W[gq];B[io];W[go];B[im];W[jp];B[ip];W[kr]C[Or some such attack. White must be careful with the O3 -stones, so maybe reinforcing them first is a better idea. White has now large prospects for the lower left corner. Always try to gain territory when attacking.]
))
