;B[pc]C[Hello, I'm wilouf and I'm french. Please tell me how to improve my play :) Thanks a lot.

Bommel:
Hello wilouf. I'll try my best.
Enjoy the review.];W[dd];B[pq];W[qn];B[cq];W[pe]
(;B[nd]C[Question(s) :  I suppose a pincer was more appropriate here, but I was not confident on how to make it good, so I played like that

--

Bommel:
Playing this way you end in sente and can take care of the right side if you want to afterwards. If you want to play a pincer here, you probably want to go with R13 (see variation).]
;W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[rb]LB[ph:A]C[S18 is wrong. The correct move is P18. You only want to play S18 when there is a Black stone around "A" and you can threaten the life of Q15. With the help of R6 white is even stronger as usual! So there is no excuse for leaving a weakness in your shape.]
;W[qi];B[ql]C[Question(s) : Is it ok ? Is the 3rd line a good choice to pince here ?

--

Bommel:
The right side is low, so there is no need to invade right away. I would prefer looking for a big point on the board and reduce the right side later.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pp]C[Question(s) : I never know what is the best answer to this crosscut on the corner. Your guess ?

--

Bommel:
I would also suggest the crosscut here.];B[rq];W[qr];B[po];W[op]
;B[qo];W[oo];B[rr];W[pr];B[pn];W[jc];B[nq]C[Bommel:
I don't like this kikashi. It destroys valueable ko-threats and reduces the impact of Black R1.]
;W[oq];B[qg];W[pg]
(;B[pf]C[Bommel:
This move is unusual. I prefer the normal move at R12 (see variation).]
;W[qf];B[ph];W[qh];B[og];W[rg];B[pg]C[Bommel:
This shape is terrible! you should play ko with S14. In the current situation black cannot win the ko and should leave it for later and play elsewhere instead of connecting.]
;W[re];B[je]C[Question(s) : Is that kind of move good here ?

--

Bommel:
No. The center is worthless in this position. Playing K15 forces white to strengthen his upper side. This is exactly what White wants.]
;W[hd];B[cj];W[fp]
(;B[hq]C[Bommel:
Are you afraid of a White moyo on the lower side? You shouldn't. I prefer playing D6 here and watch white failing to establish something useful on the bottom (see variation).]
;W[dq];B[dp];W[eq]
(;B[cp]C[Bommel:
The solid connection seems unreasonable here. Descending at C2 is better (see variation).]
;W[kq];B[ho]C[Bommel:
Say thanks to white for this present :)];W[fn];B[dm];W[hm];B[ko]
;W[kp];B[jo];W[em];B[nm];W[mo];B[fd]C[Question(s) : Is this a good idea in your opinion ?

--

Bommel:
This move is questionable. You do already have one weak group on the board at K5. Here you create another weak group which is usually bad. If you cannot threaten the life of H16, which seems impossible, you should approach from the other side at C14. This gives White some profit, but this is the result from an earlier mistake (the exchange of K15 for H16).]
;W[df];B[ff];W[hf];B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[cb];B[hb]C[Question(s) : That move was bad, isn't it ?

--

Bommel:
It turned out bad for you. Jumping out at F12 seems more natural in this position.]
;W[gc];B[fc];W[gb];B[ce];W[de]C[Bommel:
This is too early. F14 is not out yet and you already start an attack which strengthens White further! This hurts F14.]
;B[cf]C[Bommel:
Leaving the kikashi aji at C15 for later would be better.];W[cg]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[ch];W[dg];B[bi];W[bf];B[ah];W[be];B[gg]C[Question(s) :Do you think F12 tobi is better ? or something else ?

--

Bommel:
G13 is ok. You can also consider F11, since H14 isn't a real target anyway.]
;W[hg];B[jb]C[Bommel:
Unreasonable, white can connect his group with C18 anyway.]
;W[jd];B[kb];W[lc];B[mb];W[eh]C[Bommel:
You ended in gote without much profit. Better get your head out right away and leave K18 for the endgame.]
;B[gh];W[hh];B[gj];W[hi];B[gi];W[ej];B[hj];W[ji];B[hl]
(;W[gl]C[Bommel:
Your opponent is kind. He should try to split H8 and K5. If this splitting attack works well, one of your groups is in serious troubles (see variation).]
;B[jk];W[il];B[jj];W[hk];B[ij]C[Bommel:
You got away easily, white could have crushed you here.

The following fight in the center is pointless, since there isn't any real profit there to get. There are bigger points for the endgame on the board. There isn't much to comment on during this fight so I will skip it.]

;W[ib];B[ia]C[Question(s) : White lost there, out of time.
I thought it would have been tough for white now. But thinking more about it, I guess it was going to be tough for me. I added 3 fast variations and I can't figure a way for black to get a good result (killing or closing with M10 without to much loss).

I hope there weren't too many questions, thanks for the review by advance

--

Bommel:
Interesting game, especially the opening. You can find some final comments at the end of your variations.]

(;B[ha];W[kd]C[Even if k15 is only one eye, my k18 group is to weak to manage a kill

Bommel:
Killing is out of question here. White can connect with C18 anytime he wishes to (with D19 or F19)]

Yes, and even if it would work, white still can connect to C18.]

Yes, White cannot be killed. The result would depend on the endgame, but white has the better position at the moment.]

Your stones work together nicely. The white moyo is still wide open. Nothing to be afraid of. You can always reduce/erase it with a move around "A". Considering this, a play at D6 is ideal.]
