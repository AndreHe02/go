C[f: hello, i'm white


PETE: Hi! I'm Pete (3k AGA). Hope you enjoy the review. 

Both players played well. My advice to both players:
1. try to read out fights a bit more
2. don't just play sente moves - but play sente moves with maximum value / threat

Advise for white: Couple of times in the game you considered two black stones on third line (2 points appart) as 'weak'. That type of shape is not weak. It is hard to attack unless you have support stones near by. So be aware of that. If black played his fight a bit better, you would be in trouble I think. Aside from that I think you played very well and had a good sense of where the next big points are. 

Advise for black: I think you got a bit too greedy in the top-left part of the board. Play calmly and collect your own big points before you go into an invasion like this. Also, you missed on opportunity to seriously threaten the white group on the top-right side. There was a lot of aji there. Besides that I got a feeling you are playing very nice solid game .. in few cases almot too solid and too passive. In few cases you played too close to your existing safe groups. As you gain more experience you will be more confident to play faster moves. Good luck.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[qn];W[qp]LB[mq:A]C[f: nonstandard i know - aiming for the pincer on R6 if he played around N3, to make a complicated situation (which I feel plays to my advantage)

PETE: this move would make a lot more sense if white had a stone at A already.]
(;B[qk]C[f: black worried about the pincer but I keep pressure on with next move, trying to ensure his groups are separate]
;W[qe]TR[qk][qn]C[PETE: this move does not put pressure on black. White is up against very stable marked group. That group is alive as of right now. So I think it will be black that should put pressure on white here.]
(;B[rd]C[PETE: Not the best response. Opens too much aji.]

;W[rf];B[qc];W[re];B[rc];W[jc]C[f: figure the right side is alive so not an urgent move, more important to somehow neutralise his influence along the top... bit worried about being pincered here]
(;B[lc];W[ke]LB[ke:A]C[f: think i was planning for a future cut at P15

PETE: Move at A doesnt really help with the cut ... See the next variation.]
(;B[fc]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[jcdenton71: This was kind of a desperate move because I did not want my opponent to secure a large area on the top left


PETE: I would prefer approach at A or B. Since your opponent has 3 stones there, there is no way to prevent him from making SOME territory (or profit). If you prevent him from making a lot of proffit at the top but he is storng there, he might turn around and make profit on the left side and that trade might not be good for you. See variations.]

[fq:B]C[f: saw a weakness at the top and didn't want to play near my thickness, so went for it


PETE: yes, there is weakness but as you have found, it ends in gote for white. So leave it for later unless you can kill the whole group now. You don't have to near thickness (say at A). You can play many other big points on the board like A, C or you can start a bigger fight by playing at D (push your opponent towards your thickness.]
;B[cb];W[fb];B[da];W[gb]C[PETE: white lost sente and got very little points in return.]
(;B[cg]LB[jp:C][jq:A][nq:B]TR[cj]C[f: opponent makes mistake of approaching thickness, i know my proverbs, so i set about punishing

PETE: I like this move by black. It renders white's wall useless for time being. But if black wants to keep more initiative and momentum, I would consider playing at A or B or C instead. See varation. 
Also, with regards to "mistake of approaching thickness". I don't think black is "approaching". With this move black has settled near thickness. If the marked stone wasn't there already, I would agree that black made a mistake and approached thickness. But here black is nice and secure - not much you can do to attack that group.]

;B[ck];W[ci];B[dk];W[eh];B[eg];W[fh]C[f: fairly happy with the result]
;B[fj];W[gh]LB[ei:A]C[PETE: good play by white. If black cuts at A, he will have 3 weak groups.]
;B[jp];W[ek]LB[nq:A]C[f: saw a potential weakness with C9 stones which, if defended, could allow my influence in the top to spread much further anyway

PETE: Yes, center will be the focus of the plauy soon. However if I were white I would worry about black playing at A first. If white gets cut off from the center there, it might be hard to develop upper-left center area because black will be able to get into it from 3 directions.]
(;B[cm]LB[el:C][cn:B][dn:A]C[PETE: way too close to the 3 stones. Should play at A instead .. or B if you want the corner a bit more secure. Hane at C is also an option.]
;W[gp]C[f: didn't want him to build up a large moyo so played in the middle]
(;B[iq]LB[jp:A][iq:B][nq:C]C[jcdenton71: not sure about this one


PETE: My teacher always tells me that this kind of play is redundant. Think about it this way: black already has a pincer stone at A. Why play B? Black can aways make base by playing at C. See variation.]

TR[qk][rk][qn]C[PETE: The 3 marked Black stones are not in dander (yet). Black should try to connect A and B together to keep that group strong. Black needs this group to be strong to attack the 3 white stones on the left of it.]
;W[jn]C[f: fearing for my three stones a bit much here? leaving bottom right corner quite weak


PETE: no, not at all. White has to worry about those stones. They can be easily attacked. Bottom right corner is not really weak (it cannot be killed). White might lose some points there but white will survive.]
(;B[hq]C[PETE: strange move - not very effective.];W[gq]C[f: keeping them groups separate...

PETE: yes .. good idea.];B[kr];W[pg]LB[pf:A]C[f: this is to make the cut at P15 sente, i think

PETE: yes, now black has to worry about those cut-points. What's why capturing the stone at A earlier was important .. and threatening the life of the whole white group. Now black has to protect his top.]
(;B[gr]LB[lo:A][gr:B]C[PETE: black does not have to worry abou this group so much yet. As long as he can jump out to A, he will be Ok. Even without playing at B, there is one eye at the bottom.]
