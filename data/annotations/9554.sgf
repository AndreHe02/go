VGK [3k\]: Hi

J: Hello.

My name is Joe, and I am roughly 1d AGA. I have included a "J:" before all my comments for this review.

I have included several alternative plays, and I have included a game summary at the end.

Enjoy.

(;W[pr]C[J: The simple move for white here, is usually R3.]
;B[qq];W[kq]C[J: With this continuation, black has a larger corner, but R6 still has a lot of aji.

This exchange feels even.];B[qr];W[pq];B[op]C[P4 is a sente ?

J: Yes. It is too tough for white to ignore this. His group is looking weak.]
;W[ir]C[This move is also sente ?

J: Yes. You respond correctly and get a solid group.];B[jr]

(;B[nc]C[As  E16 has a White stone . I hope to settle down Black corner and don't make a fighting .So , I play O17 .

J: Your group in the lower right is fairly strong. This move lets white settle too easily.
This is your side of the board, and you must fight for it.

I would consider R15 or R12.];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[cd];W[lc]

;B[dg];W[ck];B[cf]C[After move 67 , I plan to resign as Black shape is too low and small , White has ahead the territory in this fuseki . On the left side , Black is still not safety . Also , the left lower corner of White is hugh big and full of potential.

J: This move does secure an eye, but you were already connected. It is better to move this group to the center, since you need to anyways.

As far as the board position, this is very playable. White's corner is fairly flat, his upper left group has no defined territory and is other 2 groups don't have any large potential.
I would favor white here, only because because black's groups are less settled, and R6 has a lot of aji.]

C[I can 't make best move and , no potential to develope my shape to earn more territory .

J: This is a great opportunity for you. White struggles to keep this M8 group alive for a few points, while you get solid positions.]

;W[lk];B[ln];W[mn];B[mo];W[no];B[np];W[nl]C[J: This is an excellent result for you. Your B16 group is much safer, and your upper right is your only weak group.

You can use your strength to keep white's C3 corner small, and you have an attack on white in the lower right.]

(;B[jp]C[J: M2 appears to kill here.];W[kp];B[jo];W[lp]
(;B[lo]C[J: You missed your last chance at M2. After the K4 exchange, the kill was ensured.]

(;B[fn]C[J: Instead of passively defining your territory here, you should attack white to gain a several more points.
This is a good time to use your strength to attack white.];W[el]

C[hc12 [4k\]: thx

J: Thanks for submitting this game. There were several times where you could have secured your win.

The areas I think you should focus on, that will help you improve...

Early game: Pay attention to both sides when selecting a joseki. When your opponent approaches your corner, between your positions, you almost always want to pincer or pressure their approach.

Mid-game: Watch your weak groups, and try to limit the amount of weak groups you form. 
If there isn't enough room for eyes, ensure you are able to run out.
You were lucky your opponent missed many opportunities to harrass some of your weaker groups. 

End-game: Avoid playing small gote moves. T5 and R16 were both moves that did very little and gave the initiative to your opponent. Both of these moves cost you points.]
