C[AVAVT: Although there was one big losing move I can see right away, it's quite hard to see why I lost in a larger perspective.

csh: I will try my best to review your game. I hope that some of my comments earlier in the game will help you.]

(;B[de]LB[ce:A]C[csh: Black can approach instead of making the shimari. See the variation.

Also, note that the one-space jump shimari (instead of the kogeima shimari at 'A') is vulnerable when White extends up the lefthand side of the board. Later in the game, Black ends up having to make another move to protect the corner.

The one-space jump shimari is better at attacking a group on the top of the board, though, so it's a trade-off.]
;W[jc]
(;B[nc]C[csh: I would also consider the keima shimari. See the variation.]
;W[gc]TR[dc][nc]C[csh: While the ogeima shimari did force White to extend, the marked stones are too far away from the white group to put much pressure on the white group. The white group is hard to attack.]
(;B[cj]TR[de]C[csh: This move feels like a half-measure. It doesn't take a fair share of the lower left corner. It's also one space too far from the marked stone in the upper left to be solidly connected. See the variations.]
;W[cn];B[jq]C[csh: This move is a good idea. However, now that the white group in the lower left is stable, you will need to worry about an invasion in the upper left.]
;W[mq]C[csh: This move is from the wrong direction. It's more profitable to extend from the shimari.]
;B[gq];W[ch]LB[dh:A][di:B]TR[cj]C[csh: This move shows why the marked stone is too far from the upper left. Moves at 'A' or 'B' do not trap the white stone in the corner, so Black has to jump out to the center.]
;B[ej]C[csh: Black jumps out...];W[eh]TR[cj][ej]C[csh: But so does White. Now there's no way to catch the white group. The marked black stones might make thickness on the left, but White's lower left corner is alrady rather secure. The marked black stones are not making territory, either.]
(;B[ff]LB[lb:A][de:B][ff:C]TR[ch][eh][cj][ej]C[csh: I don't like this move. The stone just played is not strongly connected to the corner. It also isn't putting pressure on either white group.

AVAVT (quoting from an e-mail response): ... at the time I was following the idea of chasing 2 weak groups close then cut them apart, so I thought it should be a good move. Was it because the cut was ineffective, or are there more reasons for the failure?

csh: I think it's a good idea, but it doesn't quite work here.
----
First of all, the white stones at the top of the board are not that weak. White should be able to slide to 'A' and have enough room to live at the top of the board. Because this group is almost alive, it's not weak.

The marked white stones on the left side of the board are weak, but so are your two marked black stones. As a result, Black cannot attack the white stones strongly, since he still has to worry about his weak stones.

The variations ahead show the problems attacking the two white groups.
----
The second problem is that the stones 'B' and 'C' are not firmly connected together. If 'B' and 'C' are cut apart, Black will need to worry about his corner group living, as well as the safety of the stones in the 'C' group. It would change the situation from being on the attack to being on the defensive. The marked white stones would be splitting the 'C' group from the marked black stones, and Black would be in trouble.]

(;W[sh]C[AVAVT: It seems I have a little bit advantage here right?

csh: I don't think so. The way I see it, you have ten points in the upper right, and maybe 15 points in the upper left. There is probably ten or so points in the middle. I don't think the bottom group will make much territory, since it is weak.

Meanwhile, White has about ten points in the top group, and roughly fifteen in the lower left. I think there can be fifteen points in the lower right as well. White also has komi. While I think Black is behind, I think Black is still in the game. There still room to make points in the endgame.

Finally, I don't think that the last white move is necessary. I added a variation for the previous move. Because of that, White can start making territory while attacking the group at the bottom of the board.]

White can also slide into the corner and make a base for the white group. White also has a move at 'C' to connect underneath.

The black stones on the left are in a bad position. They don't have enough room to live, so they will need to run to the group at the bottom. They may be able to connect to that group, but while the black group is running, White will be making points along the lefthand side of the board. Black is just playing on dame (neutral points) and not making any territory.]

(;B[gj]C[csh: Jumping again doesn't really strengthen the black group. If White seals Black in the corner, then Black will need to make a move in the upper left so that his group will live.
