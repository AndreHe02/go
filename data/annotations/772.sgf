C[Hello. This game was played against a 2 kyu on IGS.

The two problems I need to work on, I think, are life and death, and tesuji (at least thats what he said). Of course, I humbly accept any advice.

--xinjia@china.com];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[ep]LB[iq:A][ip:B]
[qf:C]C[perhaps too conservative but I wanted to make sure I had something against him.

This looks ok to me. Personally, I'd probably like to play A, B or C. What you played
is probably ok. Difficult to comment on for a player at my level. :)]
;W[nq]LB[lq:A][pn:B]TR[ep]C[Here I would find A to be a better move than B. The reason is that it also stretches out from the
marked stone. Something like the variation maybe could be expected.]

(;B[pn];W[kq];B[qf];W[nd]LB[qi:A][pr:B][qk:C]C[A feels too slow here. B or C I find nicer.]

(;B[qi]LB[qk:A][pr:B][rd:C]C[I would have liked this to be at A or B instead. You can always take care of the marked stone
later. As long as white's corner is open, C is almost instant life.]
;W[cj]TR[cp][ep]C[Very big since this is also the main direction of development for the marked stones.]
;B[ic];W[kc]C[xinjia 21k*: I was planning to take one side or the other (c/d10 or j17)

There is a very big difference between C/D10 and J17, C10 is your main direction of development
*at the same time* as it's one of white's main directions. Priority should be given to play in a direction
which is very big for both players. Playing at J17 is big for white too but it doesn't give black anything
in particular, as opposed to what C/D10 would have done.];B[fc]
;W[df];B[dc]LB[db:A]C[I would have liked this to be at A instead.]
;W[cc];B[db];W[cd];B[cl]LB[iq:A]C[Big... But not as big as A would be, I feel.]
;W[gq];B[fq]LB[iq:A]C[This may be too nice to white, he gets very very solid from this contact play.
Picking a fight, starting with A feels better. Black should surely get the corner this way but at the
cost of making white very solid on the lower side as well as getting a good amount of points.
What black gets in the corner is not little though.];W[gp]TR[gp]
[gq][kq]C[Perfect shape.];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[ej]
LB[qk:A]TR[qk][ql]C[Feels ok. Black is thin around the marked points still...]
;B[nf]LB[pk:A][oj:B]C[This feels very thin. Perhaps A or B instead?
As long as black is very thin along the right, a moyo is probably not very
useful since white's groups in the upper right and the lower side already are stable. Thus,
there aren't any obvious targets for attack. Should white invade, black will have no leverage
against the surrounding white positions.];W[pj];B[qj];W[pk]
C[Now it feels a little sad that an attack on this white group probably won't be very profitable
unless the group actually can be killed. Since both the black group on the upper left side and
the lower right corner group can be considered safe, there's no use connecting them right
now. A positive approach could perhaps be something like the variation.]

(;B[ql]TR[qf][qi][qj][pn][pp][pq]LB[qk:A]C[The marked stones are already safe and white won't get any extra eyespace from descent
to A.];W[mk]C[White wants to get out from that hornet's nest as fast as possible. :)]

(;B[qc]LB[rd:A]C[This feels like the wrong point to invade at right now. If black should make an invasion straight
away, it should probably be at A instead since that doesn't damage, but rather increase the value
of black right side.];W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb];B[rd];W[re]
TR[re]LB[sh:A][qg:B][pg:C]C[Black lives nicely in the corner with the sequence in the variation, but due to the marked stone, the
right side is hurt since white can jump to A after this is over, reducing it to very little. More aggressive
moves like B and C are also possible.]
(;B[sd]C[Strange shape. Should probably be played at S17 instead.]
;W[qe];B[se]C[Black is harming his right side even more.];W[rf]
;B[oa]LB[rb:A][ob:B]C[Yet another bad shape move. A seems like the natural move here. The stone at B is not that important.]
;W[mo]TR[cl]C[This is one reason why a black play here would have been very big earlier. Due to the low position
of the marked stone, white is starting to build an impressive moyo here.]
;B[qg];W[nn]TR[no][np][gm][gl][fl][fm][hl][hm]LB[rb:A]C[The triangled stones are unimportant now since the lower right side and corner are stable and
white has gotten up to a very high position. Something deep, around one of the squared points
seems to be black's only chance. Not to mention that white at A kills black.]
;B[on];W[nm];B[el]C[Too slow. Must be deeper even if that is risky.]
;W[gl];B[fk]LB[gn:A]C[This will force white to solidify himself. Cutting two strong groups apart are rarely useful.
A move at A would be more positive.];W[hk];B[fj]LB[gn:A]C[Leaning on your opponent's stones is nice when you want to either get out into the centre or build
extra thickness. Right now it seems like black isn't in an acute need of either in that part of the board.
I think A still is the sensible move. For the remainder of this commentary we ignore that the upper right black group is dead if white plays there first.]
;W[ei]C[White is now even more solid than before.];B[je];W[ke]
;B[kf];W[le];B[me];W[lf]C[I am not quite sure what black is trying to accomplish here.]
;B[kg];W[md];B[fh];W[eh];B[kj];W[kl]C[ xinjia 21k*: Hmmm!

Right! Would be even nicer a bit deeper though.];B[ee]C[perhaps a bad move

I don't understand the purpose.];W[fg];B[de];W[cf];B[ce];W[be]
;B[eg]C[This must be even worse. What was I thinking? Around this point I lose track of exactly what are the biggest moves, especially against someone like him. There are errors all over my stones.

I think it looked ok until you let the invading group on the right side get away too easily.]
