AB[pd][dp]C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking over this. I'm not calling it a game, because it's really an awfull mess, but I believe there are still things I could learn from this. In particular the opening is somethign that I'm puzzled about - when your oponent makes you kill him everywhere and tenukis in the 3-3 invasion joseki, what is the best way to respond? The rest of the fighting is pretty much nonsense, the only other point I'm curious about is the proper way to reduce white's top left when it comes to that.

In the variations I try to better explain my thoughts, which are the thing to be corrected, most of the variations I looked at in my own review of this game are not included, since they are probably wrong. In your commentary please focus on shape points and patterns that are important to know as well as the expectations certain moves carry with them, rather than long complicated variations.

R: Hello, thank you for submitting this game. It may be a mess, but I guess that is normal for us kyu-level players.
I precede my comments with "R:". I hope they are useful to you.]
;W[cd];B[pp];W[cq]C[So here we go. I'm really curious how to react to tenuki in this joseki, i.e. are black's moves more sente or white's?]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[qq]C[Now at what point should I consider playing c2? It's threatening to kill, I'm quite certain, but white should be able to live anyway?!

R: White is alive in the corner. C2 is a big move, but it does not kill. If white would not react to C2 you may be able to kill (part of) whites group. However, in that case white would get two moves elsewhere on the board so it is doubtful that this would be a gain for you.]

(;B[pq]C[R: This looks good to me.];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn]
;W[rn];B[qm];W[qc];B[qd]TR[qm][cd]C[R: I guess blocking at the other side is better. See next comment.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]C[here I chose the double hane, because I didn't think the wall would be usefull and wanted at least one secure group somewhere, however it's probably bad because white's ponnuki works well with his top left corner?

R: I guess you are right that a wall is not very useful here. White´s ponnuki seems good indeed. Because of these reasons I guess blocking from the other side in the first place would be better.]
;B[nb];W[nc];B[od];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[qb];W[jd]C[Really unsure what to do here. There are two unfinished corner joseki that I'm not sure whether they can be killed, my extension from both walls (I guess K4) seems very urgent, I try to play sente moves against the corners to have time to come back to play on K4.
I'm not sure if I have to worry about white's top side and if yes where the best way to reduce it would be.


R: I would not worry too much about white´s top side because I think you can develop your moyo at the bottom faster than white can develop his moyo at the top. K4 seems like an important point indeed. You can definitely not kill the corners if white responds, but I like your idea of trying to play some sente moves against the corners and then come back to K4.]
;B[cr];W[br];B[dr];W[jp]LB[cr:a][br:b][dr:c]C[white tenukis. Now I can kill the white corner, which I chose not to, as it seemed to risky right now.

R: I am not so sure that you can kill the corner. I added a few variations. Perhaps starting with c instead of a would have been better. If white responds you can turn your attention elsewhere and if white does not respond you can next jumt to b, which couses more trouble for white.]

(;B[lq]TR[od][pd][qd]C[If I capped the K4 stone I'm sure white would be able to live and it would be hard to use the center influence. I play this to put pressure on that stone and at the same time strenghthen my right wall.

R: This seems a little overconcentrated to me. Strengthening your right wall may be a good idea, though I think this is not urgent, also because of the strong marked stones. Creating a few points of territory here and letting white get away easily would be really bad for black. If you cap white, it could well be that he does not have too much trouble making eyes, but you may get to play Q2 which threatens the white corner and center influence could be used to invade the upper side and reduce white´s potential in turn.]
;W[nq]LB[pr:a][or:b][qr:c][oq:d]C[another crazy move by my opponent that I'm not sure how to respond to.

R: Perhaps white intends to play the sequence white A, black B, white C, black D in sente. this would secure the corner and leave black with a little bit of a bad shape and even more overconcentrated. Maybe playing at A to prevent this and at the same time threaten the corner might be good, though the possible continuations of the fighting that follows with white trying to make eyes or to flee is too complex for me to read.]
;B[pr]C[I play this because it's sente agains the corner, intending to attack white's stones severely.

R: seems good to me.];W[lp]C[white of course ignores.];B[mp]
C[trying to connect my group, still afraid to attempt killing white.

R: Playing at the lower side is the right choice now. The corner is worth many points, but does not greatly affect the rest of the game. Also remember that whoever gets the corner has to invest a move, so the other player gets an extra move somewhere else on the board. The fight on the lower side is very urgent now, so you don´t want to tenuki from that.]
;W[kq];B[lo];W[kp];B[mq];W[ko]C[white makes awfull shape.

R: Yes, I do not like this move either.];B[rr]C[After white's slow move I feel compelled to try to kill.

R: White made himself really heavy on the lower side. It would be good for you to take advantage of that and attack. Imagine you attack the white group on the lower side, white ignores it to make life in the corner and you get another move on the lower side. White really could not afford that.]
;W[rm]C[and in order to do that I must hane on the second line...

R: Playing on the third line is safer. That way you would build up more strenth against the white group on the lower side and if white lives at the right side in gote you get the initiative to play at the lower side and attack white there. This would be good for you.]
;B[rl];W[rq];B[sp];W[qr];B[qs];W[sr];B[rs];W[so];B[sm];W[ql]
C[and here the fighting begins. I think it's fairly obvious that I should win this, since white has few liberties in the corner, however I blunder and the game swings in white's favour.

R: Yes, I guess you should win this. However, to make things safer for you, you could have played your last move here. White would still be dead.]
;B[rk];W[po]
(;B[om]C[this is the blunder... I'm not sure what the correct move is though.

R: I like your idea for black in the variation, though I think white has a better response.]
;W[pm];B[oo];W[on];B[pl];W[pn];B[qk];W[ol];B[pk];W[no]C[not sure if I can save this group. Probably not, which would mean this position is resignable.

R: I´m not sure whether you can save this group. But you are right that even if you can, the influence white got is huge. So I guess you can resign here anyway.]
;B[np];W[op]
(;B[oq]C[another blunder.];W[nr]C[here I realize that all of my stones there are dead, consider resigning for a moment but then decide that if I can somehow run out the tail of my poor group, reduce white's top and kill the left corner, I would still be in the game. Needless to say that should be impossible.

R: Yes, of course this should be impossible, though you can of course always hope for your opponent to blunder... but to me that does not seem like much fun.]
;B[mo];W[oo]C[a big move assuming I can escape, but maybe sealing me in is better, since I can't get more than one eye on the bottom?

R: I am not quite sure. This does seem to be the safer way for white to play, which is good considering that he is ahaid and does not want to create complicated situations in which he might make mistakes.]
;B[mm];W[nm]C[another slow move that does almost nothing.

R: white probably wants to keep your stones from connecting.]
;B[mk]C[I keep running];W[nk];B[oi]TR[jp][kp][ko][lp][kq]C[that's probably way too greedy and I should be helping my poor running group.

R: Yes. And  at the same time you could aim at attacking the marked white stones.]
;W[ni];B[oh]C[same here..];W[rf]LB[rc:a]C[crazy move by white

R: this aims at white A, but it does not make much sense to me to play this move now.]
;B[pf];W[mj];B[lk];W[gp]C[white tenukis giving me a chance to really start running with my group. Not sure what the correct point is, but I'm happy with the result given the circumstances.

R: white does not really tenuki. White makes eyes for his group and tries to weaken your wall a bit. But perhaps it would be better for white to try to keep pressure on your running group.]
;B[bs]C[first I decide to ask white what he intends to do with his corner though.


R: I like your timing here. If white would not repond you could not only kill white, but also have eyes in the corner for your wall.]

(;W[bq]C[wrong move by white. I belive A3 would live. Here I'm tempted again to kill.

R: A3 would be bad for white, see variation.];B[ap];W[bm]C[and have to hane to do so.

R: perhaps this time it is good to take some risk since you are behind.]
;B[bl];W[am];B[ao];W[bk]C[white can escape, which I didn't consider when playing the hane. Here I'm content with letting white crawl on the second line, looking forward to making points in the centre and maybe attacking white's bottom group.

R: this is indeed not bad for black.]
(;B[ck]C[R: better to just connect. You have to play at that point anyway after white plays A8, see variation.]
;W[bj]C[R: ???];B[al]C[white blunders though and gets cut off. I think black is back in the game.

R: I guess so.];W[fd]C[white tenukis and ignores his weak bottom group which I should go after right now. First I strengthen my middle group while sealing white in.

R: seems like a good plan to me.];B[jm];W[dg]C[white ignores again. Here I should attack the bottom group severely, but instead try to reduce white's top, which is clearly bad timing to do so. The reduction also fails and I'm wondering about what invasions/reductions would be best LOCALLY.]
;B[hc]LB[hf:a]C[R: this makes it easy for white to seal you in and it is doubtful that you can live with so many white stones around you and no black ones. Locally I would prefer a light reduction, perhaps at A. If white reponds your stone there strenthens your group on the lower right a little bit and could be helpful in the fighting between your unsettled groups that follows. If white does not answer, then you might get an opportunity later in the game to make a more severe reduction or invasion.]
;W[gc];B[he];W[ic];B[hd];W[hb]LB[hg:a]C[this way I made a heavy group and almost didn't reduce anything.

R: your group does indeed seem heavy, but you did reduce something. You cannot expect to take away all points from white there. Perhaps you could have played A instead of your last move. White then could capture your stone, but you would have limited whites potential in sente and the stones you played are easier to connect to one of your groups.]
;B[gr]C[now I go back to attacking white.];W[hq];B[hr];W[ir]
;B[gq];W[ip];B[jr];W[is];B[ho]C[again tempted to kill white, trying to justify this peep by saying that cutting off that one stone would secure my right group for good.

R: seems good to me.];W[hp]C[R: if white answers is certainly good for you.]
;B[kr];W[km];B[kl];W[lm]TR[km]C[here I have some serious connection issues which can't be avoided without ko.
it's fairly clear that white should win that ko and from there the game is lost for black.

The rest of the game, ending in a big blunder by me is not worth reviewing.
Thank you very much for your advice and excuse me for submitting such an ugly game.

R: this may actually be resolvable without ko, see variation.
This game seems very suitable for reviewing to me. I like your questions because they give guidance on what I could give comments that would be helpful to you.]
