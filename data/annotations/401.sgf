C[Comments 97-0109 by Erik Ekholm, Swedish 1 dan, on request by 'rimas' at NNGS,
who played Black here.]
;W[qp];B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[mp];W[lq]LB[qo:A][nr:B]
C[After this move I thought if it would have been better to plan the 
Avalanche joseki instead of O3.

EE: No, your choice of joseki was fine. It isn't advisable to cheer 
White up by playing a joseki as complicated as the avalanche, while 
taking black in a handicap game.

White should have played on the right. The played move, which actually 
is a post-joseki  invasion point, aims at linking under with 'b'.
That plan seems too low at this early stage.
]
;B[qo]C[EE: Good! (I think :-)];W[ro];B[po];W[kq]LB[nr:A]
C[EE: I don't 
understand this move. Too slow and heavy. The move here is 'a' to link up. 
White could also play on the right.]
;B[rn]MA[kq]LB[hq:A]
C[I was also thinking of 
O2 but liked S6 more because white S6 would nullify the thickness which I built up.

EE: Both are very satisfying moves for Black to play. O2 (P2 and N2 are alternatives) would make White's last move (marked) look really heavy. White then probably has to play on the right, so Black can attack strongly with 'a'.]
;W[rp];B[qm]
C[Was this move really necessary? I think now not. :\\

EE: If it weren't for White's next move at O2, this "honte" would be good, but under the circumstances, Black should play O2 to separate White.]
;W[nr]C[EE: Good, White has saved face at the bottom.];B[mq]
LB[no:A][mr:B]
C[EE: This looks like a typical case of aji-keshi, i.e. reducing your possibilities, and is thus better left until later.

Firstly, it is an excellent ko threat; secondly, if a black stone later would end up at 'a', Black could play 'b' instead to start a ko fight; thirdly, Black is giving White a kikashi (forcing move) at 'a'. (White can't play 'a' without the exchange in the game, since that would make Black 'b' possible.)

If White plays at N3 himself, Black might tenuki, or just happily connect, which would strengthen him.

Maybe this looks like an unimportant detail, but it illustrates an important principle.

]
;W[mr];B[jd]LB[pg:A][dj:B]
C[I'm trying the sanren-sei strategy.

EE: Good. Around 'a' to build a moyo in front of the thickness might also be a good idea. Note that this san-ren-sei is much better than the one constructed by 'b'.]
;W[cf];B[ch];W[ef]
C[EE: Good - because this is a handicap game! It would simplify the game too much if White enters the corner (the normal move), which would be to Black's advantage. When White runs to the right he is also reducing the Black influence there.]
;B[fd];W[bd]MA[ch]LB[dh:A][bh:B]
C[EE: Not so good. By exchanging this for the 3-3 point, White loses the possibility of invading the corner later, when his stones on the outside are safer. In a handicap game, White should try to keep his options open for as long as possible.

If the marked black stone were at 'a', the slide would have more meaning, since White could then make an eye-base with 'b' (which is joseki).]
;B[cc]
C[I had to choose between this move and strengthening C12 with D9 or similar. But I prefered corner before side.

EE: Black should welcome a chance to play here.]
;W[fq]MA[kq]
C[EE: Wrong direction. White is low and solid (marked stone) so this side is uninteresting for both players. White should take care of his stones in top left instead.]
;B[fp]
C[The right joseki??? 

My idea was to keep white's bottom moyo as small as possible. (if Black D6 white  would surely F5 or so)

Also I saw some perspective to use C12 later.

EE: Very good! Leaning on White and making him strong where he already was solid (= inefficient for White). Black has played well so far.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[eq];B[dq];W[dn];B[ep]
C[I read this response in "The Power Of The Starpoint".

EE; Then it can't be wrong, can it? :-) It takes a liberty which sets up for the cut. Another idea is to cut directly (but I don't know for sure if it is good).]
;W[co];B[gq]
C[Maybe C8 would have been better?

I doubt because the cut serves two purposes: reducing white's moyo and ensures life for black's D4 group which avoids a running battle.

EE: Making Black strong here gives him free hands on the left.]
;W[hq];B[gr];W[hr];B[gs]LB[er:A][dr:B][fs:C]
C[EE: Should be at 'a'. Wa-Bb-Wc and Black is in trouble!];W[hs]
C[EE: White misses his chance.];B[er];W[ck];B[eh]
C[I was thinking about this a lot. 

On the one hand I didn't want to give the whole left side to white and that's why wanted to save C12. 

But on the other hand I knew this fight would strengthen white on the 14th line which is dangerous because of a possible invasion on the top (H17, E17 etc.).

EE: This moves seems most natural - no need to waste time thinking about it! :-)]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[gg];B[de]LB[di:A][dh:B][df:C][hd:D]
C[I'm looking for ways to ensure top moyo without hurting E12 group.

EE: This does very little for your top moyo; D15 doesn't make much of a shape. And when White connects he can play the peep at 'a' without worries (or even aim for 'b'). Instead of strengthening him like this, you should have the option open of cutting at 'c' later. So you are actually hurting your group below with this move. 'd' seems to be the move for ensuring the top territory.

rimas: Actually, I'm already thinking what I could do to white's C5 - D6 - C9 :-)

EE: That's the right attitude! But White's group is pretty stable yet.

]
;W[df];B[hd];W[qf];B[pi]LB[qh:A]
C[The right joseki?

EE: Pincering is the way to use the thickness below. If this or 'a' is better, I can't say.]
;W[qh]
C[EE: It is usually considered bad style to make a shoulder hit from below. You might argue that Black gets overconcentrated if he answers, but not enough to justify this move here, in my opinion.]
;B[qi]C[EE :Good!];W[og];B[ni]LB[nd:A]
C[EE: I think black should play from the weaker side - at 'a'. Imagine a White move there; I would feel apprehensive against a 3 stones stronger opponent.]
;W[qc]
C[EE: In light of the last comment, I do not advocate this move.];
B[qd]
C[The right side?

Don't say no!!! I was thinking about this 5 minutes. :-)

EE: The other block would give white instant profit and security, while this move separates him, promising a further attack on the three stones below.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc];B[nd]LB[od:A]
C[Here I was sure I chose the wrong side.

EE: The side seems allright, but the point might be 'a' instead.]
;W[mg];B[nc]LB[oc:A][ob:B][nb:C][pa:D]
C[EE: Why on earth not at 'a'??? That is good shape, while this is no shape at all! Next Ba-Wb-Bc-Wd: White lives small in gote while being completely sealed in.]
;W[ob];B[gh]
C[EE: White has one weak group at D14 and one at P13. Drive them towards eachother and just before they join - BAM! - put a stone right between them, the classical double attack.

Black has the right start...]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[ih];B[ii];W[jh]LB[lh:A][kg:B]
C[EE: Now Black should play 'a' or 'b' or whatever necessary to keep the two groups separated.]
;B[ji]
C[EE: Ouch! This helps white to join the two parts together. Of course, if Black can kill the whole dragon, then he has succeeded, but it would be safer to have two smaller weak groups to chase, than one big. ]
;W[kh];B[ki];W[ld];B[lc];W[kc]
C[EE: Overplay? Maybe White has to try it.];B[le]
C[EE: That is a tesuji sometimes, but maybe not here... Black is unnecessarily making things very complicated. I think Black should cut.

For the next few moves, it is very hard for me to say what is good or not.]

W[pb];B[hp]MA[ki][ni]LB[mi:A][lg:B][nf:C][ng:D][rh:E][bg:F]
C[I know this move was wrong.

I should have moved somewhere around L5 in order to close my right center moyo. But I couldn't figure out _where_ to move and that's why avoided it.

EE: Yes, locally L5 is splendid, but the chaos at the top isn't settled yet. White's dragon (big eyeless group) might be able to live, but it has big worries. Black should have a-d in sente (which mend the weak marked gap in Black's wall). Then Black can tease White with 'e' and 'f' and If White somehow manages to live  (in gote), Black can go back and take L5. Then his right center would be secure territory.]
;W[ip];B[ho];W[io];B[lp];W[ko]
C[EE: Good, White needs to get access to this area.];B[kp];W[jp];B[ln]
;W[mj]
C[EE: White is risking a lot, hit long group above is very vulnerable.]
;B[mi];W[oj]C[EE: Has White forgotten/given up his dragon?];B[nj]
C[I'm starting to play too complicated. :(

EE: Indeed! Normal moves are almost always the best.]

B[gj];W[fi];B[ej];W[li];B[lj];W[mk];B[ok];W[lk];B[lh];W[lg];B[nf]
C[EE: !?! *NEVER* help your opponent to connect where you can cut! The *only* thing that could justfy this move is that you had read out a fool-proof followup that kills the whole group.]

B[nn];W[pp];B[no];W[rk];B[dl]LB[bp:A][di:B]
C[Maybe E8 would have been better?

EE: Hard to make much profit in the center - 'a' is bigger. Hmm... maybe White 'b' is dangerous?]
;W[cl];B[dm];W[cm]
C[EE: The center is open from two sides and you can only make one move at a time - that's why it is small.]
;B[in];W[em];B[en];W[dk];B[el]LB[di:A]
C[I think I should have better F7 here.

EE: You should not have tried for points in the center to start with. Black will have to watch out for White 'a', now and later.]

C[I just discovered here that white has a big group with no eyes ;-)

But White has potential eyes at A, B and C and I really don't know how to close them :)]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[rh];B[bc];W[of];B[ne];W[rl];B[ql];W[pf];B[be]
C[C15 would have closed this one...

EE: Yes but White already has his second eye at T10. Still, B15 gives away points.]

C[EE: Why are you making these throw-ins? Time trouble?];W[ja];B[ga];
W[ia]LB[do:A]
C[EE: This is the smallest point on the board! Leave one-point ko to the very end of the game (just  before filling dame). The two-point reverse sente play at 'a' seems to be the biggest point on the board now. Btw, Black should have played there ten moves ago.]

C[I was not sure if White could do !
 something awful here. So I counted and found out I could "spare" one point for safety. :)

EE: Very good! Those who bother to count simply win more games. (You may quote me on that! :)

BTW, the corner looked safe to me.

Nice game. Both players made some mistakes, but they show the right attitude.]
