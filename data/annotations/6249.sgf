C[Hello, my name is Sven and I´m about 8 kyu at Dragon Go Server and around 13 kyu at KGS.
My comments are all preceded by "--" and I hope they will provide a little bit of help to you.

Your game was lost by some conceptual mistakes in the opening and early middle game. The most important point is to claim the corners first, then the edges and finally the center of the board. Then, you should not try to connect all your stones into one group, but to create a few groups at different places of the board.

Have a look at the number of stones needed to enclose an area of 9 points at different places...(see variation)]
