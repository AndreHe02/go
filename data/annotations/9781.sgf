C[Hello, thank you for reviewing my game.


Hello. :-)

I am a European amateur 2d player, going by the name "HonFu" in the GTL.

This game is a lot about fighting. As a reviewer I never feel sure if I have read it all out correctly. I'd like you to see my variations as possibilities of what might happen, as ideas you might want to try out in your next fights. I am trying to get a bit into the logic of fighting in general, what it is about, what you can hope for in a fight ... I hope this will be of use.

So let's go!];B[pp];W[qd];B[cp];W[dd];B[dj];W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[*Hon* This looks strange to me. Black is just strengthening his opponent instead of trying to go for something more by applying some pressure.]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[fp];B[dn];W[jq];B[lq];W[jo]LB[ch:C][dl:B][co:A]
[nq:D]C[was this defense too slow here? But I thought it was important to have a stable group...

*Hon* Since you want to aim at his formation on the left side, it is probably good to be safe here yourself. The fitting proverb: "Make a fist before you strike!" Since Black also has a weakness at D, he can't defend anything at once.

So your defense also prepares an attack and therefore shouldn't be bad.

Generally in a fight we want to follow this priority list: 1.) Ensure our own safety; 2.) threaten the opponent and 3.) build up influence or territory. Most important is your own safety, but of course we try to find moves that at the same time attack an opponent's weakness and create some points or influence in the process. 

This is the underlying premise of all fighting. Let us call it the 123 principle!]
;B[lo];W[cg]LB[dl:A][co:B]C[instead of C 13 I also thought about Q/R 10, but I thought black's approach at C 14 would be bigger...

*Hon* I like a move on this side, because it aims for Black's weaknesses. If Black got around to play C14, he would be able to fight more easily on this side.]
;B[od];W[mc]LB[oc:A]C[*Hon* When we play this pincer, we have to keep in mind that it aims at crossing under with A. So usually Black does not allow it but prevent it one way or the other.]
;B[kc]LB[oc:A]C[*Hon* Since Black just didn't play anything there my first impulse would be to follow up on the aim and connect with A.]

(;W[me]C[*Hon* So you want to fight, since it is your side of the board.

I can understand, but in hindsight just taking the corner - since it led to a good result - would have been the safer way.]
;B[of]
(;W[pe]LB[qf:A][qg:B]C[*Hon* I wonder if this peep is good. I would have just extended to A or B.]
;B[oe];W[qg]LB[qc:A][re:C][qf:B]C[*Hon* After this exchange, black has become more solid, but you still have thin shape. Black might later work with moves like A, B or C.

As in a fight we want to follow the 123 principle, strengthening the opponent while not strengthening ourself is doubtful.]
;B[oh]
(;W[pi]
(;B[qk]C[*Hon* I can understand this move, since it attacks a weak point of White and builds up the lower right. Black is neglecting his defence a bit, but if White can't find a way to really exploit it, he will be alright. The stone at the top has a lot of space, and the other group is far out in the open for now.

Well, from what we see in this game, R9 will be playing a major role]
;W[oi];B[nh]
(;W[lf]C[*Hon* If you want to attack strongly, this move was probably too slow.]
;B[hc]LB[kc:A][oc:B]C[all I did here, was trying to keep black seperate, but somewhere I must have made a mistake...

*Hon* From my view on the moves so far you probably see, that it was not all that easy to get a hard attack on Black. 

I think, you could not expect too much from this fight in the first place. After Black had played A, it was two stones against two in this area (your upper left corner was far away), so you didn't really have an advantage. I think it would have been easier to get some kind of advantage by just connecting at B in the first place.]

(;W[jd]C[*Hon* I'm not sure about this idea to just press on his stones like that.]
;B[jc];W[id];B[kd];W[ke];B[fc];W[hd]C[*Hon* Good exchange - he has to answer passively now.]
;B[gc]
(;W[dc]C[*Hon* I have doubts about this move.

You are still weakish in the center, and also Black is still not settled. Playing should continue to be about the strength issues; this move kind of takes a break from the fighting, taking points. This looks contradictory to 123.]
;B[fe]C[*Hon* Black jumps out. 

At first glance you might think: Hey, nice exchange, I got a lot of points in sente. But if you look at it from 123, you took some points (3), but made your opponent separate your center group, which weakens it (1), which will make the fighting for Black's weak group easier (2).]

(;W[ld]C[I didn't liked playing this move, but I thought it was necessary to keep black seperated and defend my own group. Was it too slow?

*Hon* The main problem here is that you may separate Black, but one of his groups is already alive.

So if now your opponent gets to settle the other group, your attack has not accomplished a lot. I think, D17 might have been the wrong idea.]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[pc];W[rb];B[nc]C[*Hon* This exchange is not really helping Black. He has no real potential for eyes here anyway, and if you extend, his top group will become weaker again.]
;W[mb];B[jf]LB[ld:A]C[*Hon* Because of A, Black can now peep here, trying to make your stones heavy.]

(;W[je];B[lh];W[if];B[kg];W[ig];B[jh];W[gf];B[ef]
(;W[dg];B[eg]C[*Hon* After this exchange, you still have bad aji in the corner, while you also provoked an answer that weakened your center group, which is altogether the opposite of what 1 should do.]
;W[gh]C[*Hon* This defends (1) and threatens (2).];B[eh]
(;W[ii];B[ih]
(;W[hh];B[hi];W[kf];B[hj]
(;W[fn]C[I could've made a 2 space extension here, I think...

*Hon* I think, this move is not good. You were strong to begin with, and you just help Black to cover some weak spots.]
;B[el]
(;W[qm]TR[oi][pi][qk]C[*Hon* If you see your two stones as strengh, you might want to invade and separate the marked stone at the same time, but ...]
;B[ok]C[*Hon* ... Black jumps out and you have to live inside, which is bothersome.]
;W[qp];B[qq]
(;W[pq];B[rq]
(;W[po]C[*Hon* Ataris are always suspicious. You just strengthen the enemy's stone, while keeping yourself weak (which is the opposite of 123). 

From a crosscut, you normally extend.];B[op];W[pl];B[pk];W[nm]
;B[ml];W[mm];B[ll];W[lm];B[km];W[ro];B[oo];W[on];B[oq];W[qn]
C[it feels like this invasion somehow was bad too.

*Hon* Well ... you invaded and survived, so you reduced his moyo. Locally it looks okay enough to me, but Black got points in the center with the group, that was supposed to be attacked in the beginning. 

Probably we can see this as another indicator that the fight was not so profitable for you.]
;B[ri];W[qh];B[ni];W[eb];B[fb];W[ci];B[cj];W[kr];B[lr]C[*Hon* Black answers a lot of your moves. On the other hand, he is ahead and can afford it. The game seems to be lost for White.]
;W[ls];B[ms];W[ks];B[mr];W[ol];B[nk]
(;W[er]C[*Hon* This is gote.];B[dr];W[fr];B[in];W[io];B[gm]
;W[hn];B[im];W[fi];B[di];W[bi];B[bj]
(;W[ds];B[cs];W[es];B[cq];W[rh];B[qi];W[ph];B[lb];W[aj];B[ak]
;W[ai];B[bl];W[rl];B[cb];W[db]C[in hindsight I can say that, blocking here is greedy, but I judged that white is lacking points, so if I still want to have a slight chance, I have to hope my opponent will make some kind of mistake here....

*Hon* Even if you keep all of this territory, you are losing the game. My estimate would be about 10+ for Black.

So let's make a summary. You started a fight in the top right, where it was two against two. The number of "actors" in the local place is an indicator for who would profit from a fight. So in this case, it looked like it was just even. And from all the variations we looked at, we also saw that it was not so easy to determine who's better - until there were mistakes.

If you had just connected your stones instead of fighting, you would have gotten a solid result. One has to be careful not to become too lazy, but when you have the choice between a complicated fight of which you don't really see how you can profit from it, it is often better or at least safer to go for an easy variation, which gives you a small, but real profit. After all go is about balance, tilting the balance slightly in your favor and winning safely - if possible - should be the right general idea.

Anyway, you started the fight, but at one point did not press your advantage hard enough. D17 looked like a "tenuki" from the fight (since this move was only about points, neither defending yourself nor really attacking the opponent), which gave Black the opportunity to get the initiative in the center. He took it and turned out as the winner of the fight of the groups in the center, building up potential in the area around tengen. 

When you invaded in the lower right, it helped Black to transform the center advantage into almost twenty points, more than making up for what he may have lost in the lower right. So when you play a game of go, it helps to always stick to 123, so that you don't miss the critical moments in fights. Then you can always grab your chances and keep the initiative.

I hope, this review game you some useful ideas to work with. Good luck with your go and see you next time!]

(;W[im]C[*Hon* I would go here first. You get larger yourself and you make him smaller. You also threaten to walk in there.]
;B[il];W[hl];B[ik];W[jm];B[er];W[fr];B[fs];W[gs];B[es];W[hr]

C[*Hon* It is annoying that this move is virtually sente.

Hm, no, I don't like this, since you also do not really have good shape in the lower right. Probably reducing from the outside, then 3-3 would have been better.]
)
(;W[rl];B[rk];W[rn]C[*Hon* Just living is probably no problem ...]
;B[ph]TR[oi][pi]C[*Hon* ... but you also weaken your own two stones. I think it was not good to treat them as thickness in the first place.]
)))
(;W[ol]C[*Hon* Maybe it's easier to just reduce ...];B[pm];W[qq]
C[*Hon* ... then live in the corner.])
(;W[bj]C[*Hon* Doing something here now is a bit annoying for Black, since he has just played E8 to defend this area. It is the "last open door", which is usually the signal to intrude. But of course doing something in the lower right is also very large; just wanted to be sure to mention this.]
)
(;W[ok]C[*Hon* Okay, let us assume you don't invade.];B[qn]
C[*Hon* Black plays safely, so that you can't really enter the lower right.

You defend your weak spot though (1) and get sente. So now let's see what happens if you just enter the endgame ...]
;W[kr]C[*Hon* This is probably sente.];B[lr];W[bj]LB[qq:A]C[*Hon* Next largest point would be something here.

Well ... I still see you behind, so this course of play seems to be too relaxed to actually work. Maybe then instead of just endgaming one has to try something with A, like creating a ko.]
))
(;W[cl]C[*Hon* You could always aim at something like this.]
;B[cj]C[*Hon* If Black confines you ...];W[co]C[*Hon* ... You will find Aji to work with.]
;B[do];W[dp];B[bp]
(;W[cn]C[*Hon* Like this you probably just die ...])
(;W[el]C[*Hon* But maybe you can use the aji to have a safe getaway.

I am not sure about what exactly to do in this area ... but after your jump, clearly there is nothing left at all. We have to look for ways to make the opponent's weaknesses tell!]
)))
(;W[gj]C[*Hon* Maybe just here is better, so that you don't get cut off.]
))
(;W[fi]TR[ii]C[*Hon* Is this really sente? If so, you can force him to connect, and then your move at the marked spot works without problems.]
))
(;W[de]LB[ff:A][eh:B]TR[mb]C[*Hon* I would maybe rather go here. You get stronger shape, and you can still aim at his thin shape, for example by pushing with A, then surrounding him with B. After you got the marked stone, Black's base seems somewhat doubtful.

In other words: You strengthen your corner (1) while threatening the opponent's group (2) and of course also solidify your territory in the corner (3).]
))
(;W[jg]TR[hd][id][jd]C[*Hon* Is it possible to defend "creatively" here?

The three marked stones are just glued on top of an enemy living group. They are not really important, so you can try to "sell" them, in order to strengthen yourself in sente (1) while also aiming at the opponent's weak group (2).]

(;W[li]C[*Hon* If you want to do something, probably now is the moment. 

The top group is alive anyway and your D16 group will survive.]
;B[ni];W[nj];B[mj];W[mi];B[ph]C[*Hon* The question is: Is it even possible? I am not sure.]
)
(;W[ok]C[*Hon* If you can't attack directly, you might want to prepare it with a move like this. 

Now killing the center group and erasing the lower right become miai. 

You have to be confident enough to handle your center group, but I think, that should be no problem.]

(;B[hc]TR[mc][od][me][oe][of][oh]C[*Hon* I think Black should consider to just extend.

(;B[pd];W[pc];B[qe];W[rd];B[nd];W[nc]TR[kc]C[*Hon* After a bunch of "normal" moves, Black's marked stone is sitting in a strange place, right in front of your strong stones.

So after defending yourself, you also created a bit of attacking potential (point 2 of the list) and took quite a large territory (point 3).]
)
(;B[nd];W[nc];B[md];W[pd];B[lc]LB[ld:A]C[*Hon* If you just defend, Black may get around to defend his stones, too. 

But to me it looks as if you got the better deal out of this exchange, since, although you both are safe, you got quite a large territory and can still aim at the cutting point A.]
