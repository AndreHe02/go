Hello, im octan8 (9k) and this was a game at KGS against Remmilard which I lost. I have made a few comments on mistakes that I know of which you dont need to comment on.
---

Hi, I am javi at KGS 4-5k. I would try to help you in my review of this game. Anyway, dont take all my advice for true because I am only a little stronger than you.]

very rarely ecounter sanrensai and even more rarely this move, maybe R17 better than R11 ?
...

You have many options here. Probably the more usual would be invading at r17. Look at variations.]

(;W[qi]C[R11 is not bad but it is the third stone on third line on the side so a bit low. After p14, r14 is also weak so I would prefer to play high at q12 or r17.]

guess joseki is S5 or some such but felt very slow
---

Your are right, s4 and s5 are joseki even s2 BUT m3 it is joseki also :)

Black can settle his group easily so the question is about direction of play. Is the bottom more valuable than the corner? that is the question.]
;B[rr];W[rp];B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[nm]C[O7 is too agressive and black could have punished you. Look at the variations.]

(;B[mn];W[ip]C[Good move, giving you good balance in the bottom while defending.]
;B[qe]C[This is a huge move, securing the corner while attacking.]
;W[cf];B[ch];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[de];W[bf];B[eg]C[Black is following a standard way for developing his san ren sei moyo.]
;W[ck]C[I think c9 is going a little too far because it leaves behind the possibility of a black invasion around c6. If you are thinking on attacking you should go a line more to c10 threating to cut at d13-e12 or connect at b12. If you prefer to play solidly it is better c7 leaving space for a two space jump later.]
;B[eo]C[This is a very shallow invasion. I would prefer to play at e3, opening the corner and having enough space on the bottom for living.]
;W[eq]C[Very good ยก];B[gp];W[gq];B[hp];W[hq]
(;B[cm]C[Now black is attacking you. Anyway, I think he had a better option. Look the variation.]
;W[ek];B[em];W[fp];B[dj];W[dl]C[This is VERY bad for white. You let black cut you, connect his two weak groups and get quite a lot of points in an area that was yours few moves ago. You should keep black separated and under attack.]
;B[dm];W[gk];B[dk];W[el];B[cl];W[fm];B[fn];W[gn];B[gm];W[fl]
;B[go];W[hn];B[fo];W[jc]C[This is a well know "trick" for invading the side. The important thing to remember is that you are weak while he is strong, so you should try to settle or run lightly.]
;B[kc]
(;W[id]C[---
looked througha few pro-games for similar positions and found the variation, is it better ? this didnt turn out very well for me
---

I think there are many, many variations but the most frecuently played are with the doble cross cut at L16 instead of j16.]
;B[kd];W[if]C[This is a light play which is the right idea in this position :)

You should not be afraid of sacrifice some stones if you reduce black area.]
;B[ic];W[jb];B[ib];W[hc];B[hd];W[ie];B[kb]C[bad move. Black should have played at h18 instead.]

(;W[gf]C[I think G14 is wrong here because let black keeping most of the top. Look at the variation]
;B[gd];W[hi];B[mm];W[ml]C[n8 is very aggresive leaving too many cutting points for white. I would play at q9 but the cutting point at q7 stills works.]
;B[km];W[pg]C[Very big move.];B[hm];W[im]C[You didnt notice your cutting point again :(]
;B[in]C[But black did it.];W[hl]C[Remillard [9k\]: If you'll be my bodyguard I can be your long lost pal.... I can call you betty... and betty when you call me, you can call me al... :)]

;B[lk]C[Instead of connecting at m9, I think it is much better for black to cut at q7 as before.]
;W[nj];B[nk];W[ok];B[rf]C[Again black lose a very good oportunity to cut at q7 or p10.]
;W[rg];B[pf];W[og]C[Big mistake. You should connect at r13.]

;W[qn]C[White tries to retreat but there is no good way to do it :(]

;W[qm]C[---
this move was really bad by me but I would have lost anyway :(
any comments on what I did wrong is greatly appriciated.

Thanks in advance !
---];B[pk]C[Final commentary

I think that you play a little too much aggresive and many times you have not notice weaknesses that you are leaving behind. Maybe looking the game from your opponent view could help you. Where could he play?. What happens if I dont defend?.

In my opinion, you have a good territory concept so if you improve in the fights, usually by defendind you should, your game could make a leap ahead.]

(;W[hb];B[ja];W[gd]C[I think this is much better because black stone at h16 cannot escape even when the ladder is broken.]

(;W[ph]C[another option, leaving the r17 invasion open for later.]

(;W[nc]C[another one, with the idea of dont letting black have the top so easily.

From here, black has many continuations and most of them are fights]
