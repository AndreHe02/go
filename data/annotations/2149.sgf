C[I
don't know what it is, but all my games look awkward to me.  I think that
I play my stones too close together, or something.  I'm not sure what it
is, by my style needs help.  My opponent is white, I am black.

I won
this game by a comfortable margin.  But while I was playing it, I felt like
my opponent was the better player.  I'm not ranked yet, but I think I'm around
19 or 20k in IGS.  KGS has me over rated at 13k.

Thank you in advance for any comments added to this game.  I really really appreciate it.]
;B[pd]C[Hi,

Just like you, i'm still learning Go. When I review games for the others, I admit that i would make mistakes too. If you find any point that you disagree with me,please don't hesitate to tell me, we shall discuss that together. That's a way to improve your skill too :)]
;W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[dh]TR[ee]C[The squeeze.  I have so much
trouble with this.  I read about squezes in a book, but I never know how
to react to one in a game.  I probably should have jumped to the triangle?


Yes, jump to the triangle is more common. I would play at triangle in response to white's move.]
;B[ch];W[di]C[Why didn't white hane instead?


Well,it really varies from player to player. But, as you said, he should hane instead. In this game,he does not, this give you a chance to extend or strengthen your stones.]

Moving at E3 is an alternative move. Please refer to the variation.]

;B[is]C[Over all, I think lefrog played a much nicer game, I'm not sure how I won???? But I did.


Not really. Actually lefrog and you are almost the same level. From what I've observe from the game. Both sides make several mistakes while white did not seize the chance to attack you upon the mistakes you made. On the other hand,u seize the mistakes he made and strike back. These gave to more chances to win the game. In some places, it's always better to make it a ko and get the sente to play at other important place. There are a lot of chance for black to fight with white for the ko which would make white lost some more points.

From the result, you win a lot in this game, and I would say that you would be a better player than white. Seize the chance and attack, this would help you a lot in the future. Have fun! :)]
