C[
The game is in two phases.

At the start W has a rapid development and establishes a good  position.

Then W gives B a chance to attack and concedes a huge centre. B plays well to make the most of that attack.

Both players would do well to remember the proverb "Play away from thickness."]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[eq]MA[ep]C[I tend to appraach high at the marked point,
under the illusion that it's more consistent with the other B stones.]
;W[gq]C[My books describe this as severe; I always find it hard for  B!]

(;B[do]C[This move may well be good too but it seems to lead to a difficult game.]

(;W[co]MA[jq]C[When W plays this way we get into a set of variations that I always find confusing. The crucial thing though is that B is getting thickness and wants to avoid W neutralising it. B needs to get a stone near the marked point.]
;B[dn];W[cn]LB[cm:a]C[The books show W playing a instead. I never really understand how great a difference it makes.]
;B[dm]LB[jq:a][cm:b]C[Now B must want to counter pincer, but would W dare ignore this? I think not, W a, would get B b and that's too good for B.]
;W[cm];B[dk]C[But I think this time B must pincer.];W[dr]C[Seems like a neat idea for W. I'm pretty sure the strong players would criticise the style but I can't see anything B can do to refute it.]
;B[dq]C[Normally pushing into the knight's move is bad but here it seems better than letting W have the point.]
;W[cq];B[er]C[B seems to have no choice. And then ...];W[jq]
TR[gq]C[Bingo. B has thickness but W seems to have made it less valuable. Sometimes W might play further away and try to lure B into spending lots of moves capturing the marked stone. In this case I dont' really believe B can mount a strong attack on the 2 stones.]
;B[mq];W[fo];B[dp]LB[eo:a]C[Maybe a is better?];W[qk]LB[qj:a]
[qf:b]C[This must have been very annoying for B. I'm not sure whether a would be better because then perhaps a move around b would be a strong follow up. Anyway it seems to be more or less where B least wants it.]
;B[qn]TR[pp][mq]LB[qm:a][jd:b]C[B now seems to enter a phase where he develops too slowly. It's hard to develop from the marked stones. The move played or a both leave things in the corner. W can probably get a ko.
I think B has to develop his upper right corner instead. How about something aorund b?]
;W[ce]LB[jc:a]C[Big move for W. Now a becomes big for both sides.]
;B[cl]C[Both sides want this point, but B needs to get first move elsewhere. If W ignores him he'll be upset.]
;W[bm]C[W treats B's move as sente. I can't see a killing follow up for B so I think W should not have answered.]

(;B[pl]MA[nn]C[Too close to the other 3 stones.

B doesn't get a good attack on W and can't make very much territory around the marked point.]
;W[pk]C[natural. But note, W has decided that the lone W stone is worth looking after. This is now a potential target for attack.]
;B[ol];W[fr]TR[pk][qk]LB[ho:a]C[I think W should extend from the two marked stones. He's currently trying to strengthen a group that hasn't got much weaker recently.

If a move is needed then making shape towards the centre is probably better. How about a?]

(;B[fp]C[This seems to help W. Pushing into the knight's move is often bad.]
;W[gp];B[fq];W[gr];B[go];W[ho];B[gn]C[B has made W stronger and W has sente. Overall W seems to be doing well.]
;W[jc]C[Big, but I'd worry about the two stones first.];B[hn]
C[A very nice point, posibly so big that W should have played here.]
;W[io];B[in]
(;W[ch]LB[qg:a][jo:b]TR[pk][qk]C[This seems very small. A move at a makes life hard for B. Virtually any answer leaves a follow up towards the corner or allows W to expand the top left.   Also if the concern in the B centre then stabilising the marked stones allows much more aggressivce approaches to the burgeoning moyo.

I'm also tempted by b because B there could is pretty strong and then the centre is getting large]
;B[di]C[B should get after those 2 W stones. The whole upper right needs attention.]
;W[pf]LB[ph:a]C[Aggressive. Pushing to the max. Possibility of extreme complications if B plays at a.

I think W can afford to be more gentle.];B[nc]C[If B calculates that he's ahead then this sort of thing is fine. If he thinks he's behind then he wants a fight.

I think I would have started the fight.];W[je]TR[nc][pd][pf]
[pk][qk]C[B's marked group is now sufficiently strong to make the marked W group vulnerable. I'd have reinforced the weaker group.]
;B[lc]LB[qe:a]C[Small. If B is worried about his group then
a move near a is a lot bigger.];W[nq]LB[jo:a][eg:b]C[I think this is giving B a chance.

Putting aside my concerns with the marked group [Securing this would make about 15 points so it's not small\] B's other way to win is to make a very large centre.

B has a strong move at a and can make mischief around b and before long there's a substantial moyo.

W probably is entitled to some sort of reduction of B in the bottom right but must not do so at the expense of making B's centre huge.]
;B[oq]LB[mp:a]C[This seems a conservative response. I'd have played a and asked W to show me how he intends to live.

At this point W has played a forcing move, he has lost some potential in the corner but has not done any real harm.]
;W[lq];B[lp]C[This seem to leave lots of B weaknesses.]
(;W[kp]C[This is where the troubles really begin.];B[lr];W[kq]
;B[mp]C[The important thing now for W is to treat the corner as being not that much biger than it was. The crucial changs is that the centre is nearly closed off.]
;W[kr]TR[lr]C[So this move is much too small. B does not care about the marked stone.]
;B[ko]C[Huge. Excellent move.];W[jo]C[Making cutting point in B's shape is a good idea.]
;B[jn];W[kn];B[lo];W[km]TR[ko][lo][lp][mp][mq]LB[ii:a]C[I'm less sure about actually cutting, and then adding a stone simply gives a target for attack.  If there's a solid sequence that wins then fine, for example if the marked stones could be captured then W's move is good otherwise, B is very thick and W must keep away.

Moves around a would be better.];B[dg]C[This could be a very clever move. B needs to avoid capturing the two white stones on too small a scale. So the best approach is to press against W and build something large in the middle.]

(;W[dh]C[This seems such an obvious move but the net effect is not what W wants]
;B[eh];W[ei];B[cg];W[ci];B[dj];W[eg];B[fh];W[bg];B[fg];W[ef]
;B[ff];W[ee]C[A good result for B.];B[jg]TR[jc][je][lc]LB[gd:a]
[id:b][jd:c][gc:d]C[Beautiful. The marked W stones could come under a lot of pressure. That "slow" marked B stone is very handily placed.

Moves such as a, or the sequence of B b, W c
and B d look pretty nasty for W.];W[lj]TR[pk][qk]C[I think W had to play somewhere near here. Calculating where is very hard. The weakness of the marked stones is going to be a problem.]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi];B[ni]LB[lh:a][lg:b][nh:c][oh:d][ph:e]
[og:f]C[It's difficult now. Both a and b look possible but neither look guaranteed to work. And B c does need an answer at d otherwise B e W d B f looks nasty.]
;W[nk]C[If B were to be submissive in answering then W could get out of this nicely.

But if B goes for everything then W needs to *know* this move works.]
;B[mk]TR[ok][ol][pl]C[The right direction. It's quite likely that in an emergency B can even give up the marked stones.

The thing is, B is just so thick around here W is playing under a huge handicap.]

(;W[nl];B[nm];W[ml];B[ll];W[mm];B[lm];W[mn];B[lk]C[Once B gets this move in things are getting tough for W.]
;W[ln];B[mj]C[B playing very solid moves.];W[om];B[pm];W[on]
LB[jl:a]C[This sequence gains one eye, but if B can play a now then W is dead.]
;B[pn]C[I'm not sure B needs to do this. But even so W is going to have a hard time making the second eye]
;W[oo]C[Waste of a ko threat.];B[op];W[jl];B[nh]C[Very cool by B.]
;W[oh]TR[oi][oj]C[Possiby W should work on his middle group and leave B to prove that he can really damage the right one. W should be able to grovel a life even if he gives up the marked stones.]
;B[ng];W[ji];B[hg]TR[je][jc]C[This is taking cool a bit far! Admittedly the two white stones at the top are now under serious threat but surely W is getting a chance in the middle?]
;W[jk]C[This stuff is very hard indeed to analyse over the board. I can't see an oviously better sequence for W yet.]
;B[kj]
(;W[jj];B[li];W[hi];B[hk];W[kg];B[kh];W[ig];B[ih];W[if]C[After this I can't see any obvious ways for W to rescue the situation.

It's annoyingly close to having things that work though, so probably a better player than I would find things.]
