AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Erik:
 Thank you for reviewing this game.  I was white in this 3 handicap game, and lost by 1.5pt.  I always have difficult playing against handicap, and hope you can give a few pointers.


Well, you catch up most of the handicap, and only lose by 1.5 points, so you can't be too far off the mark.


The good news is that if you approach it the right way, playing white in handicap games can teach you some useful skill for playing even games. In particular:

1. Playing lightly in you opponents sphere of influence - in a handicap game, most of the board starts out as your opponents sphere of influence.

2. Exploiting defects (and bad aji) in your opponet's position. In a handicap game your opponent is likely to build positions with slight defects. Often the correct way to punish this is to do nothing (for the moment). There is a problem in their position, and eventually they will feel it as the fighting continues, but there is nothing you can do directly to get an advantage from it. If you play a random forcing move, you will probably only make them stronger, which helps them.

3. In a handicap game, you should try to keep things fluid as long as possible. Keep your options open. If your opponent makes a mistake in one part of the board (for example gives you enormous thickness) then later you may be able to achieve something much better than you were expecting in another part of the board. You can only do this if you have kept your options open in that other part of the board. Anyway, learning to play flexibly is good, even if it is not always the right thing to do in even games.


In terms of your own playing, I think that there are two particular things you should think about.

First is the idea of not playing 'forcing' moves if they help your opponent more than they help you. For a move to be a forcing move it must satisfy two conditions:

    A) Your opponent must be forced to answer, or suffer some terrible consequence.
    B) The exchange of your move for your opponents reply must be a gain for you.

You have the tendency to play moves that only do A), not B).

Luckily, there is an absolutely brilliant book about forcing moves. It is called "Beyond Forcing Moves"; it is my favorite Go book; and if you enjoy reading Go books, I think that you would get an awful lot out of it now. As well as some really important fundamental ideas, the book also has some very advanced stuff, so you will want to read it several times as you get stronger, and it would be a good investment. (There are also some absolutely amazing examples from professional games.)


Second there is the concept of important areas and boring areas. If you look at professional games, you will find that it is not just that they play brilliant moves, but they always seem to have a choice of great moves that they could play. This is because they play moves now that ensure that they will have more good moves in the future. That is, they play in interesting areas. A play in an interesting area is a move that both does something good now, but which also gives you a chance of doing more good things later. Hopefully this will be a bit clearer once you have read my comments throughout the game.

An oversimplification is to say that, other things being equal, you should play near weak groups (making yours stronger, or your opponents weaker) and not near strong groups (where your moves have no secondary effect). (Of course, other things are rarely  equal on the Go board.)

The book I learned this concept from was "The Great Joseki Debates". However, apart from having lots of examples of this concept, it is probably not the best Go book in the world.


I hope the remainder of my comments are useful.];W[dd];B[fc]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[cn]C[I would do something different here. 

There is nothing wrong with this move, and if this was an even game, it would probably be right. However, this is a handicap game, and black already has stones in all parts of the board, so it is very urgent for you to get a stone somewhere on the right (I would play R14) to break the black area up a bit. It would be really bad if white played Q10.]
;B[fp];W[bp]C[You could also play R14 instead of this move.

I don't like this move, it simplifies the corner too much. In a handicap game, it is better to keep your options open for as long as possible. SImplification favours the weaker player.

The other options in this corner for later are C3, and H3.

(H3 is a bit of an overplay - the kind of rubbish that white sometimes tries in a handicap game.)]
;B[cq];W[ck]LB[dl:A]TR[cf][cn]C[This is also wrong. You have three low stones in a row. 

Your last move must be at A, to keep a good high-low balance. See any book about opening theory.]
;B[pj]C[Well done Black.];W[nq];B[lq];W[pn]C[Good. You take the opportunity to mix things up a bit.]
;B[on]C[(The normal black move would be O4.)];W[qq];B[oo];W[qp]
;B[pq];W[po]C[I am not sure about this move.

Black could defend the cut by playing Q2 if he wants to (see variation).

But also the outside is quite important, so perhaps you should grab the important move at Q7 first.]

(;B[pm];W[op]
(;B[nr]C[Mistake by black.];W[pr];B[qm];W[nc]C[It is good that you are establishing a presence in another part of the board, but I think that you have approached on the wrong side.

The black group at the top is very strong and secure, so there is not much future in building a white group here - you will never get an opportunity to attack a black group.

On the other hand, the black group Q/R7 and Q10, might (eventually) become weak. For example if you could get a stone at R12, and then cut at P7. 

So it is potentially more interesting (in the long term) to build a group around R14 than on the top edge.

This is quite an important idea at dan level - playing where there is a chance that interesting things may happen for you in the future, rather than in boring areas. 

I suppose that is really why I did not like your move at C6 at the start of the game. The white group around D16 is already quite strong, therefore the whole of the left side is a bit of a boring area (no urgency for white to defend, black cannot launch an attack).

Probably the best book about boring and interesting areas is "The Great Joseki Debates", but you may need to be a bit stronger to make the most of it. I first read it when I was about 1 dan.]

(;B[lc]C[Black makes the same mistake. The top side is boring.]
;W[pf]C[Good, you take the change to play on the important side.]
;B[qf]
(;W[qe]C[Mistake. This is just a mistake, and should get captured.]
;B[oe]C[!!! what is black doing?

The only move for black is the cut at Q15.];W[rf]C[Also, what on earth are you doing? You should immediately make the strong connection at Q15, which puts a cutting point in black's shape. After that, you can capture the single black stone cleanly, rather than forcing black to make it stronger.]
;B[qg];W[qd]C[Again, what on earth are you doing? Connect at Q15!]
;B[pg];W[pe];B[od];W[rg]C[Argh! Play 14! Right now! It is absolutely essential. It solidly connects the white group out to the centre, and it completely separates the two black groups.

Cutting and connecting, don't get shut in, this is what you teach 25 kyus!]
;B[qc];W[rc]C[No!];B[qb];W[ri]C[No!];B[of]C[At last!];W[qh]
C[No!

Your white group is already alive, and the stone at S11, cannot be cut off. Therefore, all you are doing is forcing black to make his weak position stronger, with no gain for yourself.

The interesting move around here is to cut at P13, although now might not be the best time to play it.

The other interesting move on the board is on the bottom (K3 or H3) which separates black into two groups, either of which might be a target for attack.]
;B[ph];W[hq]C[Good.];B[hp];W[ip];B[ho];W[gq];B[fn];W[eq]C[Stealing black's eyes like this is good.]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[ep];W[dr];B[np]
(;W[or]C[Normally this is a tesuji, but in this situation it leaves black too many options (e.g. R5 and N3) so it is better just to take the two stones off.]
;B[mq];W[oq];B[jq];W[iq];B[mo];W[pi]C[This is not so good. I think you should play a move like J6 to keep the weak black group separated.]
;B[oi];W[qi];B[oj]C[This sequence has probably helped black more than it has helped you.]
;W[em];B[jn]C[I am not sure if this is a favorable exchange. You make your moyo on the left a little bit bigger, while black makes his moyo in the centre much bigger.]

(;W[fe]C[There is a better move around here.];B[fi]C[Black could also consider a less severe reduction, for example G9, or H14, since a move like that also expands the black moyo.]
;W[fk]C[This seems a bit slow. Black should answer at H11 (which makes sure that the single black stone cannot be attacked, and expands the Black moyo) after that white's move looks like it is on a dame point.]
;B[di]
(;W[hj]C[This is a bit feeble.

You need to (re)read that chapter of "Attack and Defense":

You can use the knight's move to attack when

1) it chases the opponent towards your thickness; and

2) it helps to build a white moyo.

If you are really lucky, you can change 'and' to 'or'. However, neither 1 or 2 apply in this game.

See the variation for a more aggressive attacking plan.];B[fg]
C[(Probably better for black to run with the diagonal move to G12).]

(;W[he]C[Again, a bit feeble.

The problem with this move is that it does not stop black from escaping, nor does it threaten to do anything above. It is just vague and in the middle.

What you should do is either find a move that attacks the black group more strongly, or you should lean more strongly on the black position at the top, so black has to answer, and then you can attack in the middle. 

See the variations.];B[ih];W[hh]C[Black's jump may have been too long, so trying to cut like this seems natural.]
;B[gj]C[I don't really understand what happens after this. The end result is good for white, since white gets a solid, live group in the centre where black was hoping to get territory. However, my feeling is that the sequence is very dangerous for white, and if black had played better, it could have gone horribly wrong.]
;W[gk];B[gf];W[ge];B[hk];W[hi];B[hg];W[ik];B[hl];W[ig]
(;B[if]C[This might be the point where black went wrong. See the variation.]
;W[jg];B[hf];W[ji];B[ie];W[fj]C[What is the point of this forcing move?]
;B[gi];W[il]C[What is the point of this forcing move?

(Without it, if you got a bit stronger, H7 might become a tesuji one day.)]
;B[hm];W[kk]C[This is the point where I think that white has got a favorable result from this fight. Black now only really has the (quite big) territory at the top. White has (smaller) territory in lots of places, it is probably about equal.]
;B[kf]C[(This is the biggest endgame move, since it expands the black area and ensures that O17 can't escape.)]
;W[mh]C[This is quite small. Black should ignore it.]
