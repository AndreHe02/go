;B[dd];W[pq];B[pj];W[qo];B[jd];W[qc]C[is this ok? or too early?

Johnny5:  This invasion is too definitely too early, and had black responded properly, it would have given him a nice thick wall that would have been difficult to deal with.  Follow the alternate path to see what I mean.]

This is unecessary and is a mistake by black.  See the alternate route for where black should have played.]
;W[jb]TR[ci][di][cj][dj][ck][dk][ip][jp][kp][iq][jq][kq]C[i want to invade there isit right?

Johnny5:  This isn't so much an invasion for white as it is an extension.  There are much bigger places to play though at this point in the game.  So far both white and black have been playing small.  I have marked the remaining "big" points on the board.  Black is less advised to play on the bottom of the board due to the stones at Q3 and R5, but could still make some territory there.  White would do well to play on the left side of the board.]
(;B[ib]SQ[mc]C[Johnny5:  Bad move for black.  Think big!  Black needs to play in the places previously mentioned.  Locally, a better solution is to play as shown in the alternate route.]

C[Johnny5: White shouldn't leave a hole in his defense.  Black can easily make a mess of things by poking and cutting.  As you can see by following the alternate paths, neither outcome is good for white.]
(;B[ck];W[cm]
(;B[cl]LB[dp:1]TR[cg]C[Johnny5: Making an extension here will only make white stronger.  Black needs to either cut the white stones at the marked point, or simply approach the cutting point in sente and work toward making a base.  Black's play here was also bad because not only did he put himself in a bad position, but he allowed white to strengthen his corner stone at D4.  The alternate route also shows a better path for black in approaching the D4 stone.]
;W[dm];B[dj];W[dh];B[ci];W[fi]C[Johnny5: Black is playing very small here.  He could have easily escaped toward.]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[bh];W[ag];B[ah];W[af];B[ae];W[je]TR[bl][iq][jq]
C[Johnny5: White should either continue attacking the black group at the marked location or play big on the bottom side.  This move does not really do anything to help white or hurt black in any significant way.]
;B[ke];W[jq];B[dq]C[how to attack this stone?

Johnny5: A 3x3 invasion would have worked fine.  This move can also work, but it seems that black is not familiar with the joseki.

As for white, hane is the correct move which was done.  See the alternate path for more possible solutions.]
;W[eq];B[cq];W[cp];B[er]SQ[fq]
(;W[bq];B[fq];W[ep];B[fp]SQ[gr]C[Johnny5: Here first, then hane.  This limits black's chances to make two eyes and keeps him on the run.]

;W[jr];B[dr];W[ph]SQ[ql][ho]C[i justwant to invade here too

Johnny5: Again, do not leave holes in your formation like this.  It may seem slow, but if black takes the opportunity, it completely ruins your attempts at containing him and may even cost you stones and territory in the end.

At this point, white really has no need to invade.  It will work well enough to simply reduce.  Also, top right corner is still not settled.  Black could still easily take it as was shown before.]

[oh:4][ph:3]C[Johnny5: These stones have no base.  It is urgent for white to either escape them to the center or to some friendly stones.  Remember, Urgent before Big, Big before small.  S7 is small.]

(;W[pn]SQ[rp]C[i dont want to let B too goin thr center so i sacrifice the 3 stones isit ok?

Johnny5: It would probably be possible to keep black contained without losing those stones and letting black live.]
;B[ro];W[qp];B[so]TR[gd][nj][ol][ho][jo]C[Johnny5: This move is unecessary for black.  Once S5 was played the 3 white stones were dead and there was no way for white to save them.  Exploiting white's weak points will be more productive.

Black does not need to cut or poke necessarily.  Simply approaching those points with the threat to cut will work in black's favor by allowing him to retake sente and reduce white's territory.]

Gim6626 [16k\]: thanks

Johnny5:My overall advice would be to focus more on playing the big places up first, setting up frameworks and stuff.  For white, make sure to play more solidly and be sure to connect stones and not allow gaps in your defense as was pointed out earlier.

For black, I would suggest reviewing life and death problems so that you have a better grasp on whether a group is alive, dead, or depending on a vital point.  I hope that you've found this review helpful and I apologize for it taking so long.]
