C[I am Black, Mirco is White.

The game was played at the Pisa Go Tournament, 2 weeks ago.

Thank you for your comment :-)

(;B[np]C[Too slow? I was thinking to get the sente to approach at D5

Az: If you want sente, then this should be at o3 (probably better there anyway since d3 is low on the 3rd line here). With this high and d3 low, you must add a move around k3 with the joseki you used.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[pl]
(;B[do];W[dl];B[fp]C[Az: You should only play this move if you are strong :) This is a fighting joseki, both sides will get into a very very hard fight. There are many more simple joseki which you can look up - this isn't bad but its rare. I wouldn't play this in a tournament, too scary and complicated for me.]
;W[eo];B[ep];W[dp];B[dn];W[em]C[I know that this is a mistake, I don't know how to deal with this move without having to run too much.

Az: This is weird. Black must come out here and seperate white, there is no question.]
(;B[cl]C[Az: This is horrible, why are you making white thick on the outside?]
;W[ck];B[cm];W[dk]C[Az: Black is no stronger for having made that exchange and W has benefited a lot.]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[fr];B[gq]TR[gr]C[white G2, before?

Az: Honestly, this whole position is a complete wreck for black. G2 would be playable now since white still needs to add a move in the corner.]
;W[bq]
(;B[gr];W[er];B[en]C[Is it urgent to connect the 2 groups?

Az: Of course. This is even reverse sente!];W[jd];B[lc];W[cg]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[cb]TR[hc][hd]C[H16 or H17 seems better, thinking of the actual result...]
;B[ed]C[Az: This is ok, but the follow up is awful.];W[de]
(;B[ff]C[Az: Only marginally better than passing since it does nothing for your stones except invite white to attack at the vital point.]
;W[gd];B[fe]C[Az: Any time you have to play a move like this you know that you've made a serious mistake somewhere leading up to this. Now you are heavy for no reason.]
;W[hf];B[gc];W[hc]
(;B[hb];W[fc];B[gb];W[fd];B[fb];W[ee];B[eb];W[hd];B[jb]C[Az: Oh the humanity. The result is a disaster.]
;W[jc];B[kb]C[Az: Bad exchange for W.];W[gh];B[nm]C[Az: First good move in a while. This works with the position on the left.]
;W[jn];B[jp];W[mo]
(;B[mp];W[no];B[oo]TR[lo]C[Should I play M5 directly?

Az: No, this is the vital point, you must come here, then you can decide how to play. You knew there was a risk of O7 getting cut off when you played it, but you got profit in exchange.]

[in]C[Az: Forget the details, this is the wrong strategy. The X's mark the absolute max you can expect to (maybe) keep, you cannot expand your territory much here because of the W stones. Trying to get more territory here makes white stones and gets you almost nothing.]
;W[lm];B[fj]C[This is a ladder breaker, in my idea.
Probably not that threatening.

Az: This has no teeth in it because white is fairly thick. It's also an overplay, as his response in game shows.]
;W[gm];B[km]MA[fj][gm]C[Az: Not a good exchange for you at all. Now the aji of the cutting stone is even starting to come back to life, this is all wrong.]
;W[ko];B[lp];W[jo];B[ll];W[mm];B[ml];W[mn]C[Is it a good choice to let me push down on the side, in exchange for a light wall toward the center?
I feel like it can be attacked, but I can sacrifice most of it to run away to the top.

Az: Black has a bunch of weak stones for no good reason here. The result is bad because your stones do nothing. The problem wasn't the way you started out here, but once you'd gotten what you wanted you kept playing more moves in the center and hurt your position.]

;B[fi]C[Az: This is aji-keshi, this doesn't do anything for you.]
;W[fh];B[ke]LB[oh:A]C[Az: Good move. 'a' is also possible, both are good directions.]

But I am interested in some comments on opening and middle game.
I have serious problems choosing the direction of play,

there is the irresolved R5 forcing move, that I didn't play in case P7 become important, but I realized later that S3 was almost sente to fix it.

Thank you again.
Andrea

Az: I hope my comments helped some. The major mistakes to me were:

 - Not capturing the cutting stone at E5 early on, and trying to submissively seek life . This helped white outside and still didn't make you alive.

 - When you invaded the UL corner you played very heavy moves that didn't threaten the white K10 stone at all. Black got a very low position and can't be happy with the result.

 - When white reduced the bottom you started playing moves to turn the G7 area into territory when there is no way its going to happen. You made white stronger, lost territory on the bottom, and gained almost nothing since you can't make territory next to a white wall.]

(;B[hl]TR[km][kn]C[Az: These two stones are not very important since white is safe anyway.]
;W[hm];B[fn];W[gl];B[pj]C[Az: I would try something more like this.]

(;B[oh]C[Az: Still huge. If you don't defend the 5 stones what is the worst than white can seriously do?]
))
(;B[oh]C[Az: Why are you rushed to play on the bottom? This is a huge point for both sides, and limits the effect of any w influence.]
))
(;B[no]C[Az: This is possible too. You will loose some territory but you can attack white.]
))
(;B[hd]C[Az: Surely this is a more interesting move to make shape. The move in game is a last ditch, "I'm trying to just save any stones here" kind of move.]
))
(;B[hd]C[Az: You must attack white of course. If white jumps out you can connect, if white tries to keep you seperate you can attack easily.]
(;W[jf];B[jc]C[Az: Connected])
(;W[jb];B[ie]C[Az: Easy for black, white is the one struggling now.]

(;W[ke]C[Az: Probably the best move for white. You could play H18 directly if you're worried about your base or go attack white. This is a fair result.]

(;B[en]C[Az: Black *must* try to capture this stone since otherwise connecting will be white sente.]

(;B[en];W[fo];B[fn];W[go];B[er];W[dr];B[gr]C[Az: This is very playable for black. The corner is weak and white is painfully split.]

(;B[jq]C[Az: Here or L3 are the normal moves. Black is very awkward without an extension here. Compare this with o4 @ o3 now.]

(;B[ql]C[Az: This is common, since the shape you left white make in game is very strong. The move in game is not a terrible mistake, but its pretty nice for white.]
;W[on];B[np]
(;W[pk];B[rp];W[pl];B[kq]C[Az: This is possible. Black has profit, but white is thick and has sente.]
