;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[fq];W[cm]C[Tami: slightly odd choice - it's joseki, but it's known to be a complicated one. Why not just C6?]
;B[jp]C[Tami: White's problem is that the 3-3 invasion is still open, but blocking the corner is slow]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[Tami: I think this is a difficult move. The diagonal is both simple and good.]
;W[md]LB[cs:A]
(;B[ne]LB[oc:A]TR[jd]C[Tami: I am relying on Kogo's Joseki Dictionary a lot, and according to that this nobi is used when Black has the marked point. Otherwise, Black should block the corner at A.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mb]TR[ne]C[Tami: White has done well with this invasion. I cannot fault it. The marked stone looks out of place, and White's R14 could still be dangerous.]
(;B[qn]
(;W[dg]C[Tami: It's a very big move, but you can't afford to miss N15.]
;B[lc];W[mc];B[me];W[kd]
(;B[fc]C[Tami: Fairly typical mid-kyu play by your opponent - more concerned with destruction than creation. M15 would have been my choice here.]
;W[hc];B[fe];W[ec]TR[fe]C[Tami: You should not play in contact with a stone that you want to attack. Black already has the marked stone, so instead of making F17 heavy (which is the only reason White should ever play the diagonal on E17 against F17) it just gives Black leverage against the corner.]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[fd];W[dc];B[eg];W[ef];B[ff]
(;W[ho]C[Tami: this is a very bad move. You cannot just break off a pushing fight like this.]
;B[dh]C[Tami: This is a painful punishment.Black wraps around White and gains control over the centre. You absolutely cannot allow moves like this.]
;W[eh];B[fg];W[cf];B[ei];W[hq];B[cq]C[Tami: this is exactly why C7 was a questionable choice.]

(;W[eo]C[Tami: this move only strengthens the opponent. Be very, very careful with attachments - they tend to help the opponent more often than make him heavy.]

(;W[mn]
(;B[mk];W[qi];B[qj];W[re]C[Tami: this is good - threatening to connect or get eye shape.]
;B[rd];W[rj]C[Tami: also a good move - you threaten to go in two directions at once, and the opponent can only block one.]
;B[rg];W[rh];B[qg];W[pg];B[se];W[qh];B[rf];W[sg]C[Tami: good forcing technique - now you have an eye at S11.]
;B[qe];W[rl]C[Tami: White did very well in this skirmish! However, there is still some danger - Black could play T11 after blocking the escape routes.]

(;W[jl]C[Tami: this is an overplay. It's usually much better to gnaw at the edges of a big moyo than to jump right into it.]

(;W[cg]C[Tami: The rest of the game is hard for me to comment on - lots of little things here and there, but nothing especially stands out.

I recommend that you

* stick to simple joseki when you want to play for the win
* or expect to lose quite frequently when you play difficult joseki, but this is not a bad thing because you can learn a lot by it
* don't miss a point that separates your side of the board from the opponent's - such moves are really urgent and large
* be careful with attachments - ask whether they make the opponent heavy or whether they force him to improve his shape

I thought you played skilfully around moves 80 to 92.

Also, try not to make overplays - they tend to cost you points. It's much better to play a conservative-looking move that aims at a big follow-up. It is gote for the opponent to prevent the follow-up, so you can count the follow-up as part of the first move`s value.
