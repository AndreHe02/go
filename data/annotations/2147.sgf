C[Hi, I would like to have this game reviewed. In particular, I'm interested to know if both sides made any glaring mistakes in the opening and midgame.

Thank you.

SDU : hi, in this game, black takes the lead during the fuseki, because white play very timidly. White should have try to play more agressively during the middle game to get back in the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd];W[df];B[cf];W[cg];B[ce];W[dg]
;B[fd];W[dk]TR[fd][ce][cf][df][cg][dg]C[Is this exchange favourable to Black, both locally and globally?
SDU : this exchange is joseki. Locally, black secures the corner points. But in exchange, black helps white to build a strong position outside. So, it looks playable for both players.]
;B[pj];W[jj]LB[qf:B][ql:A]C[SDU : K10 is ok. Others ideas are A and B.]
;B[fq]TR[dd][fd][jd][pd][ce][cf][pj][qn][nq]C[Is this the correct direction? Or is it better to play R6 or O3?
SDU : black play all this stones to build. It would be more consistent/natural to play R6. F3 is an invitation for white to take the initiative.]
;W[hq];B[cp]C[SDU : this move is a little bit tricky. White should resist strongly and cut at c3. See variation.]

(;W[co]C[SDU : this is too mild.];B[cq];W[do];B[dq];W[gp]C[SDU : White has been tricked. White has no time to play g4, this is a little bit too slow. Maybe should approach q16 corner.]
;B[qn]
(;W[nq]C[SDU  : O3 is too timid. White should try to build a moyo. See variation at P6.]
;B[on]LB[pf:A]C[Is this move urgent? Is there a better alternative?
SDU : P6 looks ok. Maybe A is bigger.];W[rp]LB[nc:B][qf:A]C[What do you think of this move?
SDU : this is too slow. S4 makes only points and black can play elsewhere. White should play at A or B.]
;B[ff]LB[pf:A]C[Again, is there a more urgent play?
SDU : yes.  F14 is like S4. It strengthen the position, but doens't put any pressure on opponent.  When you play A, it is much more difficult for white to play near the upper right corner.]
;W[fh]LB[qf:A]C[SDU : stille bigger for white to play A.];B[pf]
C[SDU : very good.];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[ld]LB[ld:B][pf:A]C[SDU : now black has allready a stone at A, it can attack white stones by playing B. This makes a big difference : now white will suffer to make a safe group.]
;W[nf];B[kg];W[lb];B[kc]LB[jb:E][hc:B][kc:D][hd:C][nh:A]C[SDU  : it doesn't look good to play M18 : white still cannot make two eyes and has to run in the center. So it's better to simply play A and wait for the opportunity to play on the upper side.
If white succeed to secure his group by playing in the center, he may be able to play "harder" on the upper side (maybe b,c, d, or e).]

;W[ng];B[lj];W[mf]LB[nj:A]C[SDU : maybe it's better for white to keep pushing , because it ables white to reduce black moyo. To convince you, imagine black territory if he can play O10.]

(;W[iq]C[SDU : white should resist, and block at j2. Even if black manages play in the center, it looks bigger for white to secure the side.]
