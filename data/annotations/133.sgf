;W[dj];B[qf]L[pf][qh][qj]C[White played `a' here, but that attachment  here seems to settle Black on the right side  nicely (even if White played attach-and-extend instead of  attach-and-block).  I'd prefer
a pincer on the right side.  There are many options; White `b', for instance,  might give
White thickness facing left, while still breaking up Black's right side (see  Variation 1).
White `c' is another possibility--please see a joseki book.]
(;W[pf]M[ic];B[pg];W[qe]L[of]C[Given that White has  already attached, I'd prefer to play the extension at `a' instead of  this block.  The block is intended to settle White's corner, but it allows  Black to solidify
his right side.  Since White's strategy seems to be to get thickness facing  left, I think  `a' would allow White to push Black down the right side without letting Black  play
`a' later (which gives him some aji).];B[of];W[pe];B[qg];W[og];B[oh];W[ng]
;B[pk];W[nh];B[oi];W[ni];B[nj];W[li]M[of][ic]C[After White's pushes,  Black's right side is essentially solid territory, thanks to his
shimari (that's why I preferred a pincer instead, or attach-and-extend,  which would have  pushed him down the fourth line instead of the fifth).  Also, Black's marked  stone retains  some aji (which he exploits with his next move) and White's marked stone is  too low and  too far away from his thickness.]
;B[nc]L[nd][pb]C[White played `a' next, which seems  slack to me.  I like something in the  area of `b' (see Variation 1).  The idea is to block off (and live in)  the corner, forcing Black to scrounge for eye space.]

(;W[nd]C[This move might be playable, but White's next move is again too soft on  Black...]
;B[md]L[ne][oc]C[White plays `a', but I like `b' better (see  Variation 1).]

(;W[ne]C[This allows Black to dive into the corner.];B[pb];W[oc];B[ob];W
[mc];B[qc];W[re]L[nb][mj]C[If Black's corner group is going to  live anyway, then White `a' is better--it's sente  and gives White incredible amounts of thickness, and probably territory, on  top, after
which White can start expanding by playing `b' or some other big point.

As it is, Black gets to ruin both White's corner and his upper side.];B
[nb];W[ld];B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[sb]C[A nice tesuji, but...];B[rb];W[sc];B
[rc];W[sd];B[mj]M[lb]C[...Black gets sente.  If White were going to ignore the  marked Black stone anyway
(which he should--the upper side isn't worth much now), he should have  taken  sente instead of playing t18 (which is basically an endgame move).

It seems that n10 is the key point in the center.  If White had gotten it  before, the
moyo balance would be very different.];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[lj];B[ec]
;W[ee];B[cb];W[gb]L[gd]C[I'd prefer White `a', which would seal Black  off from the center much better,
and would still force Black to respond.];B[bc];W[bd];B[gc];W[hc]L[gd]
C[`a' instead  looks interesting, trying to seal Black off from the center.]
;B[gd];W[gf];B[he];W[fn]C[A good move to halt potential expansion of Black's moyo,  but since Black has
already penetrated at the top, White's moyo is starting to look smaller.]

;B[ke];W[ml];B[nm];W[ri];B[qi]L[rh]C[Black is probably being overcautious here.  `a' looks fine.

No more comments past this move.  I guess my general observation is that  when Black invades, White should threaten him, seal him in, and take sente.   A few slack moves by White ended up allowing Black to reduce White's center,  and all White's thickness in the upper right went to waste.]

a group floating in the center, too, but he still has moves like `a' to  develop
it.  Black isn't going to have time to attack.]))
(;W[pb]L[ne][kc]C[Black  can now cut white at `a' (Variation 0) or try to get eyespace at `b'
(Variation 1).]
(;B[ne];W[lc]M[ic]L[mj]C[Black is in serious  eyespace trouble; White is on the attack, and is strengthening
his marked stone.  White does have a floating center group, but Black won't  have
time to attack it (anyway, White can play `a' to make shape).

I'm not absolutely certain White is alive in the corner, but I think he is.]
)
(;B[kc];W[ne]L[ie][jb]C[White is securely connected to the corner, and  even though Black has a
two-space extension, he's got to worry about eyespace.  White should be
able to chase him around and make thickness or territory in the upper
left quadrant.

In fact, instead of this move, White could play somewhere around `a' or
`b' instead, but he'll have to be careful to stay alive in the corner and  not let the running Black group start chasing White's center group.]
)))
(;W[qh];B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[pe];B[qb];W[pf];B[rf];W[oh]L[jd][id]M[qb][ic]C[White has thickness  facing left, and has prevented Black from expanding the right
side.  The only problem with this scenario is that White's top side is open
(because of Black's marked stone), so White would rather have his marked  stone
higher (at `a' or `b').  Still, White's moyo is imposing.  Black would  probably
not play this joseki out--he would rather create complications (maybe by  jumping
out to the center immediately after the pincer, rather than invading at the
3-3 point).  Please see a joseki book for alternatives.]))
