C[Hello I am black in this game. I performed a large area of influence in the upper side, and he came invade and destroy me everything, and I don't understand how I could have avoided all the weaknesses I had and how to manage the invasion. Thanks for your lightning :-)

dv: Hi Tilwen, I am Dieter Verhofstadt, 2 dan in KGS and EGF. My comments are preceded by "dv".

You've set the theme of this commentary: it is "invasion". I will point out a few strategic choices and techniques that have gradually led to weaknesses in your position, so that White's successive invasions were successful in a way that may have seemed injust. In addition to this I want to point out that invasions can do more than just take away potential territory.

Invasions are often welcomed by the owner of the sphere of influence. He will either allow the invasion to live small, while he strengthens his overall position and acquires other profits, such as territory and influence towards other areas. Or he will deny life to the invasion but allow it to escape and make good outward shape, while he converts a part of his influence into territory.

It gets worse when the invasion lives AND unsettles the groups that constructed the sphere of influence. In that case, not only the sphere of influence is destroyed, but there is no profit for its original owner and he must care about weak groups instead. This is partly the story of this game. We'll have a look how it could have been avoided.]

;W[qf];B[qh]LB[nd:a]C[The beginning is so good for black (anyway, I love ths beginning :-) )

dv: because R6 is on the third line, the right side is not so interesting. Therefore, I prefer your move 19 to be at A instead, continuing your development of a big upper side.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb]C[Here is the first question ...

dv: The hane is unusual.];B[ob];W[qb]
(;B[qe]C[Mistake ? Q14 better maybe, but the cut is still here ...

dv: In this position I don't think it matters a lot. You lose a ko threat, basically.]
;W[re];B[pf];W[qg];B[pg];W[ph]C[This cut made me really weak, but I think it was an overplay, still I don't know how to manage it

dv: Again, the low position of R6 makes life a little more difficult for your cut off stone R12. But indeed, it shouldn't have had such a hard time.]
;B[rh];W[rf]
(;B[pi]C[dv: The atari is wrong. There is no reason to push his stone anywhere. See variation.]
;W[oh];B[oi];W[nh]C[dv: White becomes stronger and stronger, helped by you. Hence, your cut groups become weaker.]
;B[md]LB[nc:a]C[dv: If you strengthen here, A is correct shape. Your move leaves a weakness at A.]
;W[ni];B[ok];W[nj];B[pl]C[Q9 better

dv: R9 may be best];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[qj];W[rk];B[pk]C[dv: As so often, the weak diagonal of Q8 results in an empty triangle.]
;W[hd]C[Here began the problems ...]
(;B[fg]C[dv: Normally I would approve of this large scale surrounding, but it seems Black has too many weaknesses now to fight on a large scale. See variation]
;W[hb];B[fb];W[hf]TR[hd][nh]SQ[fd][ok]CR[pe]C[dv: Both have two weak groups (squares and triangles) and Black's circled group is an additional group which is rather weak.]
;B[jf];W[kc];B[jc];W[jb]
(;B[ic]C[dv: When the empty triangle does something, usually another technique does the same thing better. See variation.]
;W[hc];B[ib];W[nc]C[Here I cannot do anything to avoid the catastroph ...]
(;B[mc];W[nb];B[mb];W[oc]
(;B[ge]C[dv: This is a fatal mistake. White's stones are weak but your own stones at the top left need defense. See variation.

(After writing this I noticed you found out yourself)];W[nd]
;B[ne];W[me]C[I guess here I was ready to resign

dv: It quickly goes downhill from here indeed. Let's wrap up the analysis in order of severeness:

1) obviously, your cutting group needed defense at move 69
2) pushing White along the 12th line weakened your top and didn't help your right side too much (see alternative at move 35)
3) given your lack of thickness, defense was a better option than attack at the top (see alt for move 51)
4) the defensive moves 39 and 43 required another technique/shape
5) pincering the top right corner approach was not so interesting; building the upper side would have been better (move 19)

(;B[nd]SQ[fd][ok]TR[hc][nh]C[Maybe this, but still, black's potential has vanished

dv: Good alternative! Yes, Black's potential has vanished in terms of territory, but ...

1) the upper group has been secured and even has a bit of territory at L17
2) there are now two weakish groups at both ends, but it is rather White's who lie in a sphere of influence of Black.

This way White's invasions were still successful, but there remains a lot of scope to revert the game.]
