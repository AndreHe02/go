C[Khonsu [9k\]: hi lets hav a good game

Hello I am Khonsu who played White in this game and I mainly want to know when the 41 point gap started from and how I could have corrected it.


JJ: Hello, I'm Juan Jes√∫s (JJHaggar in KGS), and I'll try to review your game.]
;B[dd];W[pc];B[dp];W[pp];B[dj]C[I dislike Sanrensei so I always dive in there as soon as I can

JJ: You must not be afraid of sanrensei]
(;W[cn]
(;B[jp]C[JJ: This is a good move too for black, very influence-oriented]
;W[pj];B[qn]TR[pj]C[Was actually considering responding with O3

JJ: With Q10 you can punish him for entering there]
(;W[ql]C[JJ: Wrong direction I think];B[mp];W[pn];B[oq];W[bp]
C[JJ: Noy a good move. You are helping him to strengthen his formation]

(;B[cq]C[JJ: Good move from Black];W[ck];B[qq];W[qp];B[rq];W[rp]
TR[fc][jc][jd][qe][cf][fp]C[are there any bigger moves than this?

JJ: Those ones were bigger. Letting him connects to that stone is not a problem at this stage of the game]
;B[gq];W[ch]C[JJ: BAD MOVE :(
You are inviting him to cut your stones!!];B[cj]
(;W[bk];B[bj];W[ce];B[cd];W[be]C[Is this good for W?

JJ: No, you helped him to strengthen his corner];B[dg];W[bd]

(;W[io]C[JJ: Very small move :(];B[hp]C[JJ: Small too];W[ho]
;B[qe];W[pe]TR[jc][jd]C[JJ: This kind of move is better when you already have a stone on K16 or K17, else you will surelly end in gote]
