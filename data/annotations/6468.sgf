C[[brindis\] Since some time I am winning or losing games because of some mistake or a tesuji, I am not understanding what is going on until a late stage in the game.
I would like your comments to improve my understanding of the board and what should be the most important moves to get more control of the game.
Thanks in advance for your review,
Jorge.

N: Hello, my comments are preceded by "N:"
In this game, you recieved some nice presents by your opponent, but you failed to wrap the game up, due to mistakes in direction of play. I hope the comments are instructive.
Kind regards,

(;B[jd];W[cf]
(;B[df]C[B: So far it looks quite even, I think. Should I have answered at F17? I was afraid of losing the central influence of san-ren-sei.

N: i do not like this move so much, because it also makes white stronger. 
F17 would be a bad move, when you look at the rest of your stones, it should be at F16]
;W[cc]C[N: a difficult choice, but i think a would block on the other side is possible too, to keep consistent with san-ren-sei (see variation as example)]

(;B[ce];W[dc];B[cg];W[fc]LB[hc:C][ef:B][dg:A]C[N: this shape is interesting. We see it more often when a white A, black B exchange is made previously. But in that case a black move at C is much more powerfull (check for yourself). 
The good part is you can be happy with sente]
(;B[fq]C[B: Probably I should have played C6, due to the C13 stones, but I felt like I could have been pressed easily.

N: it would certainly have been more difficult for white to come up with an anwer. The more i look at it, the more i think you should have played there.]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[hq]
(;B[kq]C[B: I played here because I felt it was a too good point for white... but the outcoming was quite dangerous for me.

N: i think it was not necessary to play so agressive. 
White is still quite safe, and if you finish the yoseki on the bottom side, you will have sente.]

(;W[no];B[cq]C[B: I played this to make a base with this group so I could switch to run out with L3. Right?

N: making a base is certainly good. If you are strong on one side, you can fight strongly on the other side.]

(;W[eq];B[er];W[fp]
(;B[gq]C[N: bad move];W[gp];B[hr]
(;W[cp]C[B: I think white should have played J2 here.

N: absolutely or even G2
Whites move is simply bad and misses the direction of play]
;B[iq]C[N: black is quite happy now];W[hp]
(;B[jr]C[B: I am quite comfortable living here, but in exchange I think the white influence is a high cost for living...

N: i don't mind the white influence, it is difficult to make territory in the center.]
;W[rp]
(;B[qh]C[N: this feels like the good direction, but not the best point.]
;W[rl]C[N: endgame];B[ql];W[rn];B[rk];W[rm];B[bj]C[B: After the previous sequence I think that white influence is not so big now.
So I decided to abandon R6, and try to reduce white as much as possible. Other point I considered was around K10. It should not hurt if white makes more influence because it is limited and I stil haveK5.

N:- i think the white influence is still the same (but no so much. 
- It should be crystall-clear that r6 should be abandoned, it is small, only endgame, no life or death of a group depend on it.
- I think your move is ok, it is very big, but also it is a nice reinforcement for your top left group, wich might become troublesome in the future.]

(;B[ei]TR[be]C[B: I was happy to play this move, but afraid of white E10... it would be hard to invade the white moyo.

N: still too soft
see how the white group on top has weakend because of the marked stone.]

(;W[fk]C[White played this, maybe better than E10.];B[jj]C[B: So I decided to build a big moyo and go for some territory on the top, the left or the center depending on white response.

N: ok];W[lc]C[B: I am completely lost now: how to answer here?
If M16 or O17, I am leaving a lot of space for white on the top.

N: this is very funny, in your last comment you already said how you should respond ;-)
If you build a moyo, you can't keep all.]
(;B[jc]C[B: I was not sure about playing L17 because white would be reinforced, so I choose this one but again I am not sure about what would have been the correct move.

N: Ouch! this move you should play if you are sure to make territory on the left or right side of it (or kill the left or right side)]
;W[pc]
(;B[qc]C[B: Should I have blocked from P17?

N: of course, see previous comments, you should play consistent with previous moves. But i think it would be easy for white to survive.]
;W[qb]
(;B[rc]C[N: bad shape];W[oc];B[od];W[nc];B[rb]C[B: Maybe too small, and L18 or P12 would have been better.

N: big move, the mistake is previous];W[me]C[N: now white is back in the game]
;B[og];W[kf]
(;B[if];W[hd];B[jf];W[gf];B[ke];W[lf];B[jh];W[ki];B[kh]C[B: Now I have a weak group thus giving white a lot of chances to reduce... :-(

N: i think this group is not so weak: you are strong on the left and on the right and on the bottom: so many homes to run to. also there is eye-shape on top.]

where should I have played instead?

Of course I lost the game here.
This is my last comment.
Thanks in advance for your analysis!

N: unfortunate, without it, it would have been a close game i think.
