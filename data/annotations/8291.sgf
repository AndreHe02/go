C[[B\] Hello, I am white in this game but comments for black would not hurt :-)
I liked this game a lot, I think that besides my mistakes I found several good moves... or maybe I think so because black did not answer properly.
I would like you to check my questions in the comments, and also give some guidance on the overall style. I also am interested in some border plays, I usually find myself letting the opponent to play in 2nd and 1st lines and answering him automatically because I think those moves are sente... :-(
Also notice my opponent should be 3 stones weaker, but I did not take a lead even when we played with no handicap...
Thanks a lot for your comments and best regards!];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pp];W[hc]C[[B\] Trying something new... I do not expect this to be a great move!]
;B[dd];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc]C[[B\] Probably too passive

[CG\] Yes, this is a slack move. L16 is now an ideal point for white.]
;W[cf]C[[CG\] This gives black an opportunity to to play at L17.]
(;B[ce]C[[CG\] This is a bad move since there is no black stone at D10.]
;W[df];B[fc];W[kd];B[cl]C[[B\] I am quite sure he should have played C9... this point leaves the optimum space for white extension.

[CG\] Yes, that's right. Maybe even D11 is an option. C8 also lacks a proper extension to D4.]
;W[cj];B[cn];W[co]C[[CG\] Good. The game is already easy for white.]
;B[jp]C[[CG\] Allowing D6 is unbearable.];W[dn]C[[B\] Tempting, but right now? Maybe too soon?]
;B[el]
(;W[dm]C[[B\] Bad one... Should have been at B6? See var.

[CG\] No - you don't want just to capture C6. D7 is ok.];B[dl]
;W[ej];B[gl]
(;W[qq]C[[B\] Maybe better from R6 side? I did not realize at this point about the BIG black center moyo. See var.

[CG\] The invasion is not yet urgent, and yes, R6 would be better.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[rm]C[[B\] I assume this is a bad move, but I do not know how to penalize it properly.]
;W[qm]C[[B\] Did I punish well? I don't think so... :-(

[CG\] The cut looks natural.];B[rl];W[pm]C[[B\] maybe R8 is correct?]
;B[on]
(;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oo]
(;W[ko]C[[B\] What would be a good point here? I was trying to do some noise in that big center...

[CG\] This is just the bottom side, not a "big center". Keepo calm and take care of your weak stones on the right.]
;B[kp];W[mo];B[np]
(;W[mp]C[[B\] Ugly one, isn't it? See var.

[CG\] The variation is not better.];B[mq];W[lq];B[lp];W[lo]

(;W[kl]C[[B\] L9 possible? Here I knew there was also some aji in H4...]
;B[lm];W[km];B[ik];W[kj];B[nj];W[ml]C[[B\] Now the right side was growing too big, so I was trying to find a way to enter/reduce...

[CG\] That's a result of not playing R9.];B[ll];W[lk];B[mm]
;W[nk];B[ok];W[oj];B[nl];W[mk];B[pj];W[oi];B[pi];W[pk];B[ol]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[qb]C[[B\] I think I should have played P13 here...

[CG\] Yes, Allowing B P13 is unbearable.];B[rb]C[[B\] P13 better for black?]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[og];B[nd];W[pg];B[qg];W[md];B[ne];W[qk]C[[B\] I did a lot of reading here, I was quite sure I could get profit, though black made it difficult. Can he avoid white getting S7-S8 here?

[CG\] Yes, I think so.];B[rj];W[rk];B[sk];W[qj];B[ri];W[sj]
;B[si];W[sl];B[sm];W[ql]
(;B[qi]C[[CG\] Black can get additional liberties by cutting at S4.]
;W[sn];B[ii];W[lg];B[mf];W[lf];B[me];W[lc]C[[B\] I think this is correct... should I have played M16 instead?

[CG\] I would prefer M16.];B[gb];W[hb];B[bk];W[bj]C[[B\] He closed many borders now... I neve know when the proper moment is, and I find myself answering all those moves without being capable of taking sente...

[CG\] You must realize that moves like B9, G18 and B14 are miai. You should _not_ answer these "sente" moves but take another one! Please refer to the excellent chapter in "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" demonstrating how you can loose _many_ points be carelessly answering such moves.]

(;B[hl]C[[B\] I analyzed a variation here, I think black move is ok. Is it?]
;W[ih]C[[B\] Maybe I did not have to connect here. I wanted to connect my left side group, but probably I whould have played B14 instead. Anyway, I was especulating with cutting at K15 and try to avoid the G13-F16 connection.]
