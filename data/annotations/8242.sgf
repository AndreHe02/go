AB[pd][dp]C[I am black.  In this game I tried to play solidly and not attack too early, but since the game became close I think I missed some good opportunities.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]
(;B[kc]C[\\m/ : slow, sente for kakari against LR is much worth leaving 8 unplayed]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[ck]TR[kc][qi][iq][dd][pp]C[A little simplistic, I suppose, but I can't say black is bad.

\\m/: b won't be bad in an even game. Each player had a double wing formation with 2 solid groups and a hoshi, but w has sente so nonetheless he recovers from the 2 stones but he has taken another one (the sente)]
;W[fc];B[ec]C[\\m/ : good with strong l17 group in place];W[fd]
;B[df];W[ic];B[je];W[ff];B[fb]TR[dh]C[\\m/ small this soon, keep jumping, making 4th line territory]
;W[gb];B[eb];W[dh]C[\\m/ : b's corner is solid,w don't have to fear to renforce it so contact play at d13 should end in better shape]
(;B[eg]LB[cf:A][qn:B]C[I considered playing A (C14) to take sente and then invading at B (R6)

\\m/ : good, 26 is better than A. Linking and cutting is the essence of go, the stones have to work together, a shape like UL corner here can't be bad for b.]
;W[cg]
(;B[be]C[Defending the corner like this may be a little to slow.  See variation.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[fi];B[fg];W[hf];B[gg];W[if]
(;B[gi]C[I had a hard time deciding on a move for black here.  Although I can keep white split, the question is how to profit?

\\m/ : here w has 2 weak groups so keeping them separated is a sure source of profit. Now the question is how to attack, remember this principe : "Don't touch what you are attacking". With 36, you are reinforcing d12 group to attack j14 one. Nothing wrong with that if it is what you wanted to do. My choice would be the keima j12 to let white chose what group will run out and enclose the other.]
;W[fj];B[fl];W[gj];B[hi];W[ee];B[de]C[Hmm.  Black might not need to connect here.

\\m/ : No, connecting is good. Tenuki would allow w to cut d14 from the corner and let b with a eyeless group surrounded by w. The hunter would become the prey.]
;W[hj];B[ii];W[hl];B[hp];W[hq];B[fp];W[ip];B[gp];W[gq];B[eq]
;W[er];B[io]C[\\m/ : about 52/53 exchange, don't push into a keima if you don't cut. Just reinforce w and waste a ko threat.]
;W[jo];B[in];W[jn]SQ[cg][dh][cj][hl][fi][fj][gj][hj]C[Big for white as long as it is not too dangerous for white's marked group.

\\m/ : w pushing from the strong side to his weak position, big mistake in direction. Sansan still open so after corner invasion, w position would just be overconcentrated.]
;B[im];W[jk]LB[jm:A]
(;B[qn]TR[jn][jo]SQ[im][in]LB[jm:A]C[Very tempting to continue at A (K7) instead.  It's probably necessary after allowing white the marked exchanges.

\\m/ : As you seen in your variation, A is a great move.
In the corner, I prefer sansan invasion.];W[pn];B[pm];W[qo]
;B[on];W[po];B[nl]LB[om:A][rn:B]C[The usual moves at A and B looked too heavy, so I decided to play a lighter shape.]

[jf]C[Just playing big endgame now.  The game seemed pretty close to me.  I am not certain if white's marked group is completely alive yet, but I didn't see a good move against it.

\\m/ : huge move and almost sente because of the powefull position in q9, this is good.]

But just a few moves later he let you split 2 weak groups and even if you could be more severe, you managed well to take profit from the following fight. It ended with a close game where you did well enough in the yose to finally win this game. Good game :)]
