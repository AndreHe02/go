C[N: Hi, my name is Jay and I play as Numsgil on KGS.  I'll mark my comments with N:.

You played well; be more proactive about protecting your weaknesses, and you'll do better.

;B[ip];W[hp];B[ho];W[iq]C[>>I fell from joseki here. I was pretty sure I was supposed to cut, but couldn't remember what happened after that. I think maybe I should have chosen a less complicated pincer. Perhaps H4 instead of H3.

N: This is still joseki.  The basic idea is that you want to make a base along the bottom.  Black gets living stones facing the center in exchange.  You want to push black until you have 6 liberties, and then jump once.]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[kp];W[lq]C[N: Yes];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic]
;W[op]TR[qf]C[N: Even though black's 3-4 stone should normally be approached from this side, it's no longer a very big area.  The right side is much larger.  I would approach at triangle.]
;B[pn]TR[pq]C[N: See?  Black just gets helped.  There wasn't really much corner territory to take in the first place, and if black plays triangle, he gets most of it still anyway.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[of]TR[qc]C[N: In this case I'd jump into the corner.  You're going to end up helping black make most of the right side into territory, and the thickness you get in exchange is tricky to make useful.]
;B[nd];W[rd]C[N: no, don't do this.  See http://bantari.com/go/writings/blooper_001.php.]
;B[oh];W[qc]C[N: Yes, good followup];B[nf];W[ob]TR[oe][og]C[N: You don't want to allow black to finish his cage in.  Always consider responding after being touched.]
;B[oe];W[dj]TR[nn]C[N: Good, there's not really a great local followup in the corner.  That one stone is no longer important, and neither you nor black are in danger of losing your base.

That said, I would consider the disruption of black's moyo fairly important, too.  Maybe something like triangle to poke in to the center.]
;B[lp];W[mq];B[pq];W[oq]TR[nn]C[N: There isn't really any territory here worth saving.  I'd chose triangle again.]
;B[cl]
(;W[dl]TR[ck][cm]C[>>Is this ok? I thought E8 might be safer, but I wanted to force my opponent into a fight because I have been spending alot of time on L&D and thought it might give me an advantage.

N: Don't attach to single weak stones is the usual maxim.  The exception would be a kick (either triangle), because it should reasonably force black to make himself heavier.

This attach on top says you're okay with black making a base on the side.  But I don't think that's a good idea in this case because the influence you get in exchange isn't going to be useful: there aren't any weak groups to harass or moyos to construct.]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[cj];W[ci];B[bi];W[ch];B[bn]C[>>Ended up giving him life without much resistance. I'm thinking D10 may have been better played at C10.

N: He's going to live unless you make things extremely complicated and force the game into a coin-flip scenario where neither of you can tell what's going to happen :)

The goal should not be to kill.  The goal should be to secure some of your previous moyo into territory while forcing him to run (ideal) or live small locally.]
;W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[bh];W[bg];B[cm];W[jj]C[>>I felt this was an urgent move. Ignoring the cut lead to the fight that lost me the game. But I still like this move. Thoughts?

N: I think it's okay to ignore the cut, but you have to be prepared to live locally in the corner.]
;B[dm];W[em]TR[en][cq]C[N: I would chose either triangle.  You're too weak to prevent black from running out.]
;B[el];W[fm]TR[fn][en]C[N: This doesn't protect the cut from your weaker group (the corner).  Either triangle would be a better choice.]
;B[fk];W[ei];B[en];W[fl]C[>>G8 better?

N: Yes, but you might also consider sacrificing these stones.  They're mostly separating strong groups.]
;B[ek];W[hm];B[hk];W[gj];B[gk];W[il];B[hj];W[hi];B[ii];W[ij]
;B[gi];W[hh];B[fi];W[gh]TR[jh]C[N: Triangle instead.  Black's weak group is on the run now.  You can't seal him in in a single move, so better to protect your own weaknesses.  You have a nice bit of strength facing what used to be his moyo.]
;B[fh];W[gf];B[eg];W[fg]TR[fe]C[N: Better to threaten to capture him large and help connect your two groups together.]
;B[eh];W[ef];B[df];W[dg]C[N: See variation]
(;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[br];B[eo];W[fr];B[eq];W[dq];B[er];W[do]
C[N:];B[rg];W[pk]TR[jm]C[N: I would fix up your weaknesses before you create a new weak group.  (This assumes since neither of you saw the ko for black that it does not exist :) )]
;B[rf];W[qe]C[>>I shouldn't have connected here. Something like N17 is more urgent I think.

N: I don't know, this is worth quite a few points.  But probably N17 is worth more.  I wouldn't label either as "urgent", though, since your core corner group should be able to live and you're not threatening black.]
;B[qd];W[re]C[>>Protecting at Q17 better I think.];B[pc]
(;W[qb]C[N: See variation];B[pb];W[sc]C[>>R19 for life?];B[ra]
;W[qa];B[rb];W[rc];B[se]C[N: More L&D problems it seems :)  I way to life was not immediately apparent to me, so I think this is probably a 5-4kyu problem at least, assuming a way does exist.]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[qg]C[>>Don't know what this was. An act of desperation maybe. Reaching out at Q11 might be better?

N: You might try your chances at Q19.];B[pi];W[mb]C[>>Threatend to connect at Q19 to make space life for a new group.]

C[>>Not too urgent. Was just thinking of an attack on the black groups at E2, E5, and J4. This attack is what loses the game for me.]
;B[he];W[if];B[cb];W[bb];B[dc];W[bd];B[ed];W[ee]C[>>I think D15 would have been better. D14 is increasing the amount of moves it will take to capture F12.]
;B[nk];W[nn]C[>>Threatening to attach to Q9 to give me enough influence to attack J4.]
;B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[on];B[pm];W[jn];B[kn];W[lm]TR[jo][jm]C[N: You were attached to, and you need to respond.  Either triangle would be worth considering.  You don't want to hane, because you'd just give black more forcing moves.]
;B[km]C[N: This is a "ripped keima".  See http://senseis.xmp.net/?Lamedugo]
;W[ll];B[kl];W[kk];B[ik];W[lj];B[hl]C[>>Thats it. I played a couple more moves but I knew at this move that it was over.

(;B[dh];W[di];B[cg]C[N: Ko, and black takes first.]))
(;W[ck];B[dl];W[em];B[ek];W[ej];B[fk];W[gm]C[N: Maybe something like this,  The corner is open on two sides, so you're not going to be making much territory there.  But the top left side can still be salvaged, and you have a weak black group to chase for a while.]
