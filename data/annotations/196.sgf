;W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[eo];W[cj]C[This is  an excellent wall you have created, and white should not have played this  way.  Being pushed along the 2nd line is a bad bargain.]
;B[dd];W[cf];B[ch];W[ej];B[eh]L[cl]C[With this sequence, you are letting white reduce the  influence of your wall.

I would play a instead, which also puts pressure on white at the same time as  it claims territory with your wall.]
;W[bd];B[df]L[cc][cl]C[I would  choose to play a instead, threatening to leave white without eye space.   Actually, I still prefer b at this point.]
;W[cc];B[ce];W[bf];B[cg];W[dm]C[Now  your wall has lost much of its power, and white is safe on both sides.]

;W[qf]
(;B[qe]M[qf]L[oe][qd]C[I might have  played a, separating the groups and expecting to capture one side or the  other in exchange for the corner (see variation on previous move).  But  this isn't a bad move.  Safer still would have been b, which still attacks  the marked kakari stone.]
;W[of];B[ob]L[pb]C[I think a is safer and  accomplishes the same purposes.]
;W[nb];B[mb]C[This move you didn't need, and  the result weakened your corner.  White doesn't have eyespace down here, or a  threat, even without this move.]
;W[na];B[md];W[me];B[jd];W[id]C[Consider this  alternate variation.  Be ready to sacrifice stones, as you did in building  your wall at the beginning.]

(;B[je];W[le];B[ie];W[ma];B[kb];W[qc]L[pc][ne]C[If your opponent really was trying to invade your corner  here, playing a and then b after some response in the corner would have been  a better plan.  But you might not get to make this cut you made at b.]
;B[ne]C[This is a very tempting cut, but very hard to make work.];W[oe]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[od];B[mg];W[lg]
(;B[kf]C[This would be better saved for a later  play; playing here would not help white, so you don't need to prevent white  playing here.

As a general princible, save peeks for later use, when they have a definite  purpose.

See the previous variation for one alternative.];W[lf];B[lh];W[kg]C[See the  variation]

(;B[jg];W[kh]L[li][mj][jj][fj]C[I think at this point you  should give up trying to immediately attack this white group, and instead  start threatening to attack it with moves such as a, b, c or d.]

;W[hj];B[ii];W[ij];B[jk];W[jj];B[nl];W[hi]L[fl][pc][qh][qp][jl]
C[After this move, white is quite safe.   Your marked stones are also safe.  So you should just give up the stone in  atari, and move elsewhere where the profits are larger.  I would suggest a,  b, c, d or e.

a in particular is a relatively subtle threat; see the variation.]
