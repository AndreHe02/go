Dangerbird: It was a fun game to review, with many good and bad moves and things happening.

My general advice: 
1. You need to be mindful of weak groups. If you have a weak group, defend it. If your opponents has one, try to take advantage. Weak basically means: lacking eyespace or having cutting points.

2. Be careful about cutting points. Don't leave lots of them. Especially when you have a big territory or a weak group to defend, play solidly.

3. Don't play every forcing move you see. Often that is aji keshi, i.e. takes away future opportunities from you. You often also take away your own liberties.

4. No empty triangles if not absolutely necessary!];W[dd];B[pj]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[nq];B[kq]C[This is the first problematic move, though nothing catastrophic.

First, 2-point low pincer from a 4-4- stone is not joseki.

In this case it seems this leaves too much room for the white f3 stone, while it is not that severe against o3. In handicap game a 3rd line stone like L3 will also be a good target to attack for white.

I think k4 hoshi point instead would be good, at the point of symmetry between the white stones. 4th line stone is also hard to attack for white.]
;W[no];B[pn];W[dr];B[hq]C[This is a good move. It makes base and one of the white groups should be in trouble.]
;W[cq];B[fo]C[This is not good. White is already settled in lower left. You should attack white stones on the right which are weak. L5 would be probably good, strengthening your stones and attacking white.

This also doesn't make territory, or help black on the left side, or close white in, or connect black stones. White can play G4 to separate black.]
;W[lp]C[White's idea is correct, strengthen white stones on the right and threaten attacking black on lower side.]
;B[kp];W[lo]C[Now white has the famous 'table shape' which is pretty strong.]
;B[nm]C[This is ok for making moyo on right side.

However, you should probably play around H5 to try avoid being separated to 2 weak groups.]
;W[gp]C[This and continuation shows why f5 was a wasted move.]
;B[hp];W[go];B[ho];W[gn];B[fp]C[This forcing move doesn't help your left side group at all, and your lower side group has a little less space now. You are also decreasing your own liberties.]
;W[gq]C[Now black has 2 weakish groups, not fun.]
(;B[lr]C[Would be ok to make base and reduce white base, but C6 group is weaker and the one that needs defending. 

White M4 has good shape and would be hard to kill, though you could attack it if you did not have such a weak group yourself on the left.]

(;W[pq]C[White could have attacked around C8. See variation.]
;B[qq];W[pr];B[op];W[qr];B[rq];W[np];B[oq]C[This and N2 reduce white to one eye one the edge. It could be useful for later attack. However, you reduce liberties of your own P3 stones here, which creates a weakness at P6 (which you notice later). 

And you have the C6 group which needs attention.

You should think carefully before making forcing moves like this. Play them only if you now how to use them later, and be careful with your own liberties.]
;W[or];B[mr];W[nr];B[fc]C[Racerx:

Lower left is still very urgent.  Remember, urgent moves before big ones. C9 would be the simplest move to help them. Or maybe D9 or E8.]
;W[ec]C[Bad from white to strengthen black by contact. This works if there is a white stone around K17.]

Yes, when playing P7 already.];B[qn];W[rp]C[Capturing these to stones seems too small to me.]

(;B[rn]C[Again seems too small. Left side is still most urgent. If there was time to strengthen the right side moyo, I would play R14 to make white invasion harder. (See variation.)]
;W[ko];B[jo];W[cp]C[White attacks from the totally wrong side. On the left side he could make big profit.]
;B[co]C[Here you are just blindly following white. You need to extend upwards to make room for your stones and make some territory.]
;W[en]C[White plays too close here. Now you could sacrifice 3 stones and live on the left side. (See variation.)]

;B[bo]C[Good that you spotted it. 

Your weak group lived because of white blunders but you still cannot be happy.

White got lot of territory in the upper left AND got lot of influence towards center.

These kind of things happen when you leave weak groups unattended, even if they manage to live.]
;W[bp]C[Too small for white. The Upper right moyo is now urgent.]
;B[dq];W[cr];B[pg]C[Good direction I think. Maybe even a good move. When you play on the 4th line you need to know though that there is usually room for invasion under your stones. I would play R14.]

After this move it seems white lives.

A variation could be a bit better for black, though white lives anyway.]

Looks like an ok move to me. It threatens to split black in two. White is strong in the center so it does not look unreasonable.

However, I have another suggestion for white. See variation.]
