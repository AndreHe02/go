C[Hello, I am Tilwen, White in this game. I lost the game but I really feel like I could have won it easily at some point (after the opening I think). I surely did a bad yose, but was it the only thing that costed me the game ? Thank you for your enlightning.

forfun (hereafter 'ff') - Nice to see a game of yours again. The last one I reviewed was about a year ago. 

I feel that in this game White consistently undervalued Black's thickness. This made White overconfident. White noted that Black played some low moves in the early fuseki, giving up sente too easily. However, White did not take advantage of those opportunities. Instead White left some key stones undeveloped inside Black's sphere of influence. White took territory in the corners on the right side, giving Black massive walls in exchange. In the end, Black had no difficulty using that thickness to build enough territory to win the game. White needs to develop a broader and more balanced view of the board. Walls and strong shapes like ponnuki have great value in Go, especially when they develop early in a game. We need to be careful in allowing our opponents to make such shapes. When we choose to do so, we need to build and execute plans that effectivley reduce that influence as soon as possible.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[gq]C[This is unusual, but who knows what can happen at go ? Do you think my answer was OK?

ff - This is an unusual approach. It does not pressure the corner as much as usual and it offers to settle for less on the bottom side. It dates back to at least the 17th century and appeared in many old Chinese games. It seems to have become suddenly somewhat popular in 2011 and appears in over 90 games in my database since then.]

(;W[jp]C[ff - When White pincers here what does it mean? The Black stones on G3 and Q4 are one space closer together than usual. There is more space on the left to protect and less space on the bottom to fight over. White has less space to maneuver in as well. I think that the pincer is a slight overplay compared to when Black plays the normal approach move at F3.]

(;B[gn]C[ff - However, Black's 2-space jump is somewhat thin. It will be easier for White's pincer stone to settle itself on the bottom. Nevertheless, you have pincered = you have attacked Black from both sides. Black has jumped up, separating the two White stones. What is your strategy here?...]

(;W[cn]C[ff - White encloses the corner. Is the position better than if White had played here immediately without the pincer? It does not seem so to me.]

(;B[dr]
(;W[cq]C[ff - With the wide approach at G3, we want to answer here because later we can look at playing F2 to capture one stone.]
;B[cr]C[I don't know what to think about this move. I keep saying my "student" not to play it because it is a yose move, but what to do here, tenuki, answer?

ff - Absolutely White should tenuki. This is a big yose play, nothing more.]

(;W[qf]C[ff - However, this is not the right direction. The meaning of Black's jump to G6 is to counter-attack against White's pincer on K4. Black's C2 should forfeit that chance. White should absolutely play O3.]
;B[qj]C[ff - Realize that this restrained pincer also begins to throw a distant net around K4.]
;W[nc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[qc]C[I feel like this san-san is OK, S10 is low so that I can reduce later.

ff - Locally you may be correct. However, White is cooperating with Black in allowing the construction of a huge black framework.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mb];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[kd]

(;B[rc]C[ff - As you note after S16 this is a gote sequence. Almost always in the opening playing on the second line in gote is just a mistake. Here as well. Black has twice done so in this game with C2 and now S17. 

Yet if we look across the board, Black's formation is dominating. Why is that? While Black was playing twice on the second line, White was leaving two stones, K4 and R14, stranded in Black's huge area. There is zero chance that those two stones will ever connect so we get the feeling that White has done nothing to counter Black's huge area of influence.]
;W[rb];B[rd]C[And he gives me sente ! Did I make the right choice then?]

(;W[jf]C[ff - Needless to say this is an excellent place to play. My first instinct is to play first in the lower right though...]

(;B[fc]C[ff - This looks like an overplay. How should White answer?]

(;W[hc]C[ff - This looks like the wrong direction. White's upper right is absolutely alive while the upper left corner is wide open. Playing from the right should be small. Playing from the left is the proper idea.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[cb]C[ff - Again!]
(;W[bc]C[ff - What's this?!! :-)];B[ed];W[dc];B[ec]
(;W[df]C[ff - Hane!];B[ef]
(;W[dg]C[ff - Again, why so softly?];B[eg];W[dh]C[I am not sure about the pincer at H17, but here I feel like game is good for me.

ff - The game is good in the sense that you are being pushed from behind on the fourth line. The reason for this is Black's weak play. The reason that you are being pushed on the fourth line instead of the fifth (or even sixth) line, is White's weak play. Do not be too satisfied with this result! :-)]
;B[hd]C[All through the sequence here White misses the point, which is the lower right corner. It is by far the biggest point on the board. Who plays first?]

(;W[ic];B[gd]
(;W[dk]C[ff - If White needs this, the result is not so good. Black's position on the right and lower sides is very good. White needs to play there first.]

(;B[dj]C[Maybe White C9 was better ? Can I avoid being cut here ?

ff - This is the wrong question. The Black stone is not attached to anything. It is a ridiculous overplay. The right question is can I capture this thing? If the answer is no, then the question is how can I profitably chase this thing around?]

(;W[cj];B[ck];W[ci]C[ff - White protects the stronger group.]
;B[dl];W[bk];B[ek];W[bl]C[Connect for a ponnuki …

ff - A terrible result. D9 connected on the fourth line. Now Black has pushed the connection down to the 2nd line in sente and gotten a ponuki in the bargain!]

(;B[mq]C[ff - Black could have played more strongly against K4 but presumably judged that it was unnecessary. It is not clear what White can do here. The situation is very severe.]
;W[qq]C[ff - White dives into the corner leaving the K4 and R14 stones on their own. This is an overplay. White does not need a new, small territory. Rather White needs to counter-balance Black's center-oriented thickness.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[nq];B[oq];W[or];B[op];W[mr]
;B[np];W[nr];B[lq];W[lr];B[kq];W[sr]C[ff - Black gets another huge wall while White gets 8-9 points in the corner. After this Black is far ahead.]

(;B[jq]C[And once more I have sente ! Doesn't it feel like White can easily win the game here ? What would you suggest here ?

ff - Black more or less wastes a move. However, White has big problems finding a way to successfully reduce Black's moyo. I feel that Black is ahead here. The thickness is more than enough to control the flow of the game and should rather easily produce enough territory for Black to win. White really has no prospects for making more territory than he already has.]
;W[oj]
(;B[oi]C[ff - Black chooses to make territory out of the upper wall. White is back in the game.]
;W[ni];B[oh];W[pj];B[qi];W[mj];B[nh];W[mh];B[mg];W[lh]C[I played quite fast here, but I was quite confident about my points ? Did I make some (big) mistakes ?

ff - The basic mistake is that White is confident of the score. There is no reason for that. White is falling behind as Black starts to convert thickness into territory.]
;B[lg];W[kh];B[pl]C[ff - This seems to make the territory close with Black still having the advantage of better thickness.]

;W[li];B[kk];W[jk];B[ol];W[jj];B[gb];W[pi]C[Is there something around here?

ff - No, Black is too strong. White just loses a few more points here and there while searching for something.]
;B[ph];W[pk];B[qk];W[qh];B[rh];W[qg];B[rg];W[ng];B[og];W[of]
;B[nf];W[pg];B[ng]C[ff - Black has one eye and White can never make one. White is captured.]
;W[rf];B[oe]C[ff - Black need not play anything else here.]
;W[ql];B[rl]
(;W[hb]C[I feel like he took all big points from here … The game is still playable here right ? Thank you for pointing me out what yose mistakes I did later …

ff - Black seems to be comfortably ahead here. White needs about 15 points of territory in the center to be in the game. It seems impossible that White will get it.
