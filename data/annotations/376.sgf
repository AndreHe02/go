But B played one extra move against the two stone catured group so the game was even again.  Finally, B decided to stake the game on  making a group live, and failed, so he lost.  Both sides made mistakes in the final life and death fight, so the game could have gone either way at the end.]

;B[gc];W[ie];B[be];W[cf]C[This is not an easy life and death problem.   I've shown some of the major variations.  You need to read carefully before moving since living or dying here will determine who wins this game.  The four moves shown are the only ones worth considering.  It turns out that B can  not make two eyes here, but his best try is to play at the 1-4 point to expand his eye space.  He then has a chance to counterattack against the W group in the lower left if W makes a mistake.  But B will die if W plays correctly.



The 1-2 points are worth looking at, but in this case, as is usually true, increasing the size of the eye space wins the fight.]
