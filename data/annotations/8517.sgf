;W[rb]
(;B[nh]C[In retrospect, the only possible advantage of playing S17 as a forcing move is to prevent W from using a ghost-head tesuji later. Playable or bad?

As to O12 itself... a knight's move from Q11 seemed like the right attacking move, but I quickly felt that there was a "family feud" between o12 and q11. Is there a better move? (Is this even the biggest part of the board?)

(;W[mc];B[mh]C[I was happy W submitted, but not 100% confident that he needed to. (A ponnuki is worth 30 points, after all...) Is the variation that good for B?

$ if w trades ponnuki his floating group is much stronger sacrificing the edge around m18 hurts, but since the top left is undeveloped w would still have a chance to minimize that damage. To sum up, you got away with a free, and very positive exchange at M16]

;B[re];W[sc];B[qe];W[ol];B[jq]C[I felt that getting ahead here was big. Otherwise I ran the risk of building up a line of attacking stones from L5 that was undercut by M3. Or should I have continued to attack?

I liked this move because it hems W in, but also threatens to capture at C or make good shape at D, so it solves any problems I might have with L5.
