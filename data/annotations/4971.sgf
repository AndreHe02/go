(;B[eq]C[This is too low, given white's stone at D16. The high kakari is better.]
;W[eo]C[This is regarded as a 'trick play'. The variation shows one way of answering it. It gives you territory in exchange for white influence. Unfortunately, that influence would be quite useful, with white's stone in the upper left, so again you see why the high kakari would have been better.]

(;B[gp];W[dl]C[this semmed weird xD

At this point, you can still pay C3 and take territory. Then, white D8 would end up too close to his wall, so that would be a good result for you.]

But this way you make it hard on yourself: you force white to build a wall with C16, which puts your stones below in peril.]
