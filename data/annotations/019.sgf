KM[0.5];B[pq];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[fq]C[B shimari in other corner seems better to me. W has
chance to take Q5 or there's abouts as a natural
development from his own stones, and later may well
get the extension on the left before B.];W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[op];W[pn]C
[The hanging connection is more usual. Ishida doesn't show
the solid connection.];B[lp];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[pi]
(;W[rr]C[I think W must bite the bullet and not seek safety. There's
a danger of B taking S2 and setting the group floating, but
to loose the initiative like this hurts.];B[qf];W[qe];B[pf];W[nd];B[ql]
C[End result here seems bad for W. The top corner
is invadable. M17 is also available for B, and
the B group is pretty stable. And does W need to
reply? I'd treat Q2 and Q8 as miai; W needs to
take sente. [This is the sort of judgement I
frequently get wrong.\]];W[pr];B[or];W[qs];B[dj]C[Well B got sente and the big point. But W now
has sente, W needs to examine the B wall at the bottom.
It's been severly weakened. A W invasion at the bottom  is feasible. W probably needs to avoid B having time
to strengthen around F5. I'm seeing invasion points
near G3, K4 and D3. W can always play B4 but B can
concede a small life in the corner.];W[cg];B[cm]C[This is submissive by B. I think that he ought to
play on a larger scale. Even F10 looks hard for
W to deal with. B should take the view that a mojo
race is good for him.]
(;W[jd];B[df]C[B C7 seemed a bit restrained to me. W has some hope; he took
2 good points and now B plays a curious move. B appears to
want thickness. W should be able to take a bit of profit here,
and maybe get sente?];W[cf];B[de];W[ce];B[gd]C[I think that at this point you need a plan. Are you going to let
black live on a small scale - and presumably take sente? Or
do you need to attack him severely - higher risk, bits might
drop off. Can you protect your weakness around M17 while you
are doing so. Will reducing B centre/bottom do or will an  invasion be needed?

The only way to decide (rather than intuit) is
to count. I almost never do this ;-(

Lets map out a plausible denoument if you let him live ...
B has about 15 on the right. 30 left + corner, should be
no more than 10 at the top if he lives. How big can the
bottom get then? Well W might get 20 top left, 12 bottom
right, the top's hard to count but assuming he's playing to
let B live so he gets 30. That means that if B gets 15 or
so at the bottom he probably wins, so even third line
terretory there will be enough.

My conclusion: You MUST get sente or kill B. reduction and
standard jose won't do.];W[ed];B[ff]C[So far so good; You've solidified a corner. B has
effectively "reduced an area that wasn't really
yours to begin with. I don't see a really strong attack
on the B group, but that's not surprising, it was a
shallow reduction from a strong position.   Rememberig the plan, W still has sente. Could he now
invade the lower side? I think so. But there's a weakness
around M17. So perhaps another move or so here is
in order.

In the actual game W get's into one of those frustrating
sequences where plausible sente moves are ignored for
just long enough to reduce their effect.]
(;W[eh];B[ic];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb];B[fb];W[eb];B[fi];W[fh];B[hf]C[Well you still have sente. Is B alive? I can't tell.
After F16 almost certainly, but F16 for W will allow
B to run. As he has lots of space to run in, I'd say
that the best you can hope for is a semi-sente move
at K14. So now is the last chance for the invasion.
so far B hasn't greatly strengthened the mojy. F11
does help him, but not too much.]
(;W[gi];B[jf];W[mf];B[fj];W[hh];B[fc];W[ec];B[hc];W[hk];B[gl]C[From this point on it seems to me to be
standard yose stuff. I think you've let B
get too solid before trying to find any
interesting tactical sequences.];W[hl]C[B should solidify the bottom now. Arguing
over 10 points in the middle when the bottom
is open must be bad.];B[gm]
(;W[in]C[whh: This is the move I regretted.  I'm not sure how to proceed.  In what follows I was

getting quite desperate, since I believed the game hinged on reducing the black moyo.

djna: Yes this must be too small. [I think B should have protected the
bottom long ago, but as you have the chance now ...\]

I think any of K4, J4 or J3 work. By work I mean lead to enough
confusion that you can get something.];B[ip];W[bj];B[ck];W[bk];B[bl];W[hp]

(;C[Where to invade? You are driven by what you need.
You are entitled to some 5th line invasion. But
that won't be enough to win. The space between
F3 and M4 is large. Surely you can get in?

Well I've tried all manner of moves and found no
really good answer. The trouble is that the left
side can get HUGE if you run out along the K line.
and the center can get very big if you just  scrabble a life following a 3rd line invasion.
The frustrating thing is that the bottom right
B wall is riddled with weanesses.];W[gp];B[gq];W[ip];B[hq];W[iq];B[kq];W
[in]C[Well it's OK, but I'm not sure that B has to be so
generous.])

are so many possible answers It's hard

(;W[ge];B[fe];W[fd]C[The ladder doesn't work for B so some hairy fight will
ensue. However a ladder maker by B would solidify the
bottom, so this is probably bad at the moment. But it's
something B has to watch for especially if you kick in
the previous variation.]))
(;C[Does W have the time to take the obvious point on the
upper side. It's v big, but suppose B then takes K10?
That bottom mojo is going to be solid.];W[ip];B[jd];W[kq];B[lq];W[kp];B
[ln];W[jn]C[It's not wonderful for W but he should be able to
get settled.]))
(;W[qk]C[Suppose white here instead of S2.];B[qj];W[pk]C[Not great for W, v over concentrated. But if B plays R14 now
he's over concentrated too; and he has weakness at R12.])
(;W[qg]C[But how about here? W's right side group is thick (well
he has to justify it's existance) so "play away from
thickness" I don't think B ca really attack W. W is
out in the center and has an easy eye in the corner.
I don't see a severe follow up for B.]))
