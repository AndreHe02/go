AB[dp][pd]C[Carioca: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
Pakiozzie: hi


To the Reviewer: Thank you for reviewing my game. I really appreciate it =) I have gone through my game and I dont notice my misstakes. I would appreciate if you could help me out. Some general tips would be great too. Can you please point out my weak points that I have to work on.


Thanks Again!

Jim:
Hmmmm, well you are still around 18k right?  Don't take this the wrong way, but your overall skill level is still pretty new.  For an 18k, you don't make horrible mistakes, but as an 18k anyone's overall playing style is kind of a mistake....if you can understand what I mean ^^.  Don't feel bad though, the only way to go is up, and everyone has to do it.  There is one thing in particular that I think you don't realize that will help you a lot.  That is that in Igo, the connection of your stones determines your strength.  I will elaborate on this point as I go.]
;W[dc]C[Carioca: Hello.];B[pq];W[jc]
(;B[mc]C[This kind of move is small and it actually isn't very secure.  In the opening stages of Igo, and war, and chess, and any strategy based problem for that matter, both sides spend some time strategically placing their moves in a way that will be advantageous for an attack later.  It's too early to be reacting to white's movement, think about what is good for your area.  Make a "connect-the-dots" outline of places you want to claim (though expect to fight for them later).]
;W[gd]C[This white move is pretty lame, so it makes up for your previous stone.]
;B[df]C[This is a suicide play.  It is saying "please. oh, please won't you attack me white?  I put this weak little stone next to your strong formation for you!" ;)

It's not time to attack yet, you still haven't played R5, or any of the other star points.]
;W[ce]C[Beginners are a bit predictable.  If you play something near their stones they will always react, usually exactly the way you expect them to.  However, don't get caught up in this local area because there is still a huge board left to play.]
;B[ch];W[qp];B[pp];W[qq]
(;B[qr]C[Don't go this way....];W[rr];B[ps];W[qo]C[White got ahead of you, tsktsk]
(;B[qn]C[This is what I was talking about at the beginning.  Do you think that this stone will stop white?  Nope....^^

It's too late to stop white.  This move will just hurt you because it's a random disconnected stone that is touching a strong white formation.  It will get harassed and taken advantage of.  If you learn one thing from this review, learn to never do this again ^^.  Always stay strong, stay connected.]
;W[po]C[See what happens when you don't stay connected?]
(;B[qg]C[too small];W[qj];B[pj]C[Don't touch a weak enemy's stone unless you absolutely have to.  It will just make him stronger.  When you fight in Igo, think like a snake.  Surround the prey generally, and when he has nowhere to escape move in to constrict.

However, now is not the time to be attacking, your bottom right is weak and vulnerable, as well as your R6 stone.]
;W[pk];B[pi];W[qi];B[qh];W[ok];B[qk];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl]
(;B[ri]C[There are many ways to kill this group, but this is not one.  You need to protect your own weakness first (S7).  After that, you can start attacking the bottom right.]
;W[rj];B[sh];W[oo]C[He left you a big chance....]
(;B[on]C[2nd time

Especially in a weak group like this one, you need to STAY STRONG, STAY CONNECTED.]

(;B[bp]C[Watch my previous variation.  This is the most known joseki in all of Igo, so remember it.  You can't kill the 3-3 stone without some other stones in the area, so dont bother trying.

Again, the reason to never play B4 is to STAY STRONG, STAY CONNECTED.]

(;B[qo]C[I would jump all over this move, because it makes a great shape with the D4 stone.  If white knows what is good for him, he will not let you have K4.  Furthermore, the bottom right corner is securely yours.  Even if white invades it successfully, he will gain VERY little, and the influence you gain will be worth much more.]
;W[jp]C[White would be wise to prevent you from having this....and if you like, you can harrass his stone for some profit of your own.]
;B[hq];W[mp];B[ho]C[white is still unsettled on the 4th line, but you are rapidly developing your lower left side.  The point here is not to play "lightly".  What that means is don't clump stones down in one area.  Make sure they all have some breathing room, you aren't worried about security now, just potential.]
