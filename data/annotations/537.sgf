AB[pd][pj][pp][dp][dj][dd]C[The BGA ranks of the players are:

Black 8 kyu, White 3 kyu

I've put what I think are the IGS equivalents in the header of this record.

I thought I played this game too much like a even game (close fighting) rather than taking a 6 stone handicap strategy.

(;B[eo]LB[fp:a][dn:b]C[This corner ended up dead, so maybe 'a' or 'b' would have been better for me, but witch one ?

AB: The variation you give is also ok, but so are your moves. The move you played is strong and there is nothing to worry about.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[go]C[AB: This is a perfectly good result for black.]
;W[cf];B[ce];W[ci]C[AB: It's strange that the first really big mistake comes from White. This move is just terrible.]

(;B[cj]LB[di:a]TR[ci][cj]C[maybe better push along the top with 'a' rather than this.

AB: No, you played the correct move here. You should look at it like this: The two marked stones are the last two moves played. Now, whose position got better by just these two moves? Most definitely black's! He could strengthen his stone on the side, whi
le white just put a weak and useless stone on the board.];W[di]
;B[ei]C[AB: Good! Only move.];W[eh];B[fh]LB[fi:A]C[AB: That's the point where things start to get a little complicated! Maybe the move you played is actually the best but it's definitely a move for an even game. In a handicap game you should play at 'A' and everything will be fine.]
;W[ej];B[fi];W[ek]
(;B[dh]TR[ci][di][ej][ek][cj][dj][ei][fi][fh]LB[bi:A][dl:B]
C[AB: This is definitely a huge mistake. The stone you will capture is a useless one because it is not a cutting stone. The marked stones that are involved in the crosscut are the important ones and now white can help his important stones by sacrificing t
he useless one. You should help your two stones by playing 'A'. Immediately playing at 'B' does not work! I have added a couple of variations.]
;W[ch];B[eg];W[bj];B[dl]C[AB: Now it's too late...];W[dk];B[cl]
C[AB: You should leave the situation as it is. You can't do anything good there right now so maybe later there will be a possibility to come out with an acceptable result. You should not make you defat so explicit by playing all moves out and eliminating  any future possibilities (aji).]
;W[ck];B[jc];W[ef];B[df];W[fc]
(;B[bf]LB[cg:a][ec:b][db:c]C[better at 'a'

AB: 'A' would be better because you would capture the stone. The move you played is bad because you end in gote. I would prefer answering the white move with 'B' or 'C'.]
;W[cg];B[dg]LB[ff:A][ee:B]C[AB: Being forced to connect here is terrible. Maybe a move at 'A' or 'B' would be better.]
;W[db];B[ec];W[eb];B[fd];W[gc];B[gd];W[gf]TR[ef]C[AB: This is again a horrible move by white. The marked white stone (in itself a questionable move) is completely useless and can easily be sacrificed. There is no need to rescue it. The move is far too close to black's thickness. This is an invatation t
o attack.];B[hc]C[AB: A good and calm response.];W[hb];B[ib]
;W[hd];B[ic];W[cc];B[cd]C[AB: This is not bad but is it really necessary? I couldn't come up with something white can do without it.]
;W[ee];B[ed];W[de];B[ff]C[AB: What can I say? Again, white is completely overdoing things.]
;W[en]
(;B[gb]LB[fn:a]C['a' ?

AB: Probably, I'm not sure. The move you played is certainly big, but it seems to be gote again.]
;W[fb];B[ha];W[fn]C[AB: The question is whether you can kill the white upper left corner now. I really don't know. It seems that you can at least start a ko, though of course now you must answer the white move.]

(;B[fo];W[nq]LB[gp:A][hp:B][ho:C]C[AB: You have to aware that the cut white 'A' to 'C' is pretty dangerous now.]

(;B[lq]C[AB: I'm not sure whether this is good enough to protect your weaknesses. If it is then it's an excellent move. However, in a handicap game you could also play a little more on the safe way (variation).]
;W[no];B[pn];W[jq];B[kp]LB[io:A]C[AB: This seems like a mistake. Now your stones on the left will get pretty weak. It seems that 'A' is inevitable now.]
;W[jp];B[ko]LB[jo:a]C[I wanted to play at 'a', but there seemed to be to many weaknesses.

AB: I dont' know. You will definitely lose something so an intelligent sacrifice may not be the worst idea.]
;W[jo];B[gn];W[kn];B[ln];W[jn]C[AB: The game is very complicated now. It can go either way, which is usually an advantage for white in a handicap game. White has also lots of problems.]
;B[lm]LB[gl:A]C[AB: Maybe a jump at 'A' would have been better.]
;W[jl];B[gl];W[ge]C[AB: Completely off-topic. Just loses ko-threat.]
;B[fe];W[gm]
(;B[hm]LB[fm:a]C['a' would have been another option, but I don't know if it's better.]
;W[fm]
(;B[hl]C[AB: The variation you give yourself seems pretty favourable for you. However, this move is also ok...]
;W[hn]
(;B[dn]TR[hn]C[AB: ...but you have to capture the marked cutting stone now. There are a couple of complicated variations and you cannot capture the stone under all circumstances, but it can lead to an exchange (furikawari). The move you played here is bad because it d
estroys possibilities (aji keshi). You force white to play where he wants to play anyway.]
;W[fl];B[dm];W[bn];B[bl];W[bp];B[eq];W[er];B[ep];W[fr]TR[hn]
C[AB: Now you cannot capture the marked stone anymore and you stones are lost.]
;B[gq];W[ho];B[bq];W[bo];B[br];W[dr];B[gr];W[aq];B[ar];W[ap]
;B[fs];W[jj]C[AB: You made the loss more obvious, which is bad, and you lose the stones in gote, which is unbelievably terrible.]
;B[gj];W[qf];B[qe];W[of];B[nd];W[nl]
(;B[kl]TR[nl]LB[nm:A]C[AB: The white move seems a bit overambitious. I think you should go all out and cut at 'A'. You're facing a difficult time anyway.]
;W[pl];B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[ok];B[pk];W[on];B[pm];W[km];B[lk]
;W[oj];B[oq];W[nr];B[jk];W[ik];B[kk];W[il];B[hj]TR[hm][hl][gl]
C[AB: I think this is aji keshi again. You should leave the cut open. White cannot capture the three marked black stones anyway.]
;W[ij];B[mj];W[nk];B[mh];W[pi];B[bc]LB[mf:a][mp:b][ih:c]C[better to keep running with 'a' ?

AB: Yes, probably. Your move is a bit off-topic.  Although, fixing the shape with 'B', then conterattacking with 'C'  looks good, too.]
;W[lg];B[mg];W[mf];B[lf];W[me];B[kg];W[ql];B[qm]LB[mp:A][ih:B]
[lc:C]C[AB: You should ignore this. Your stones on the right are not in danger and they will not make lots of territory anyway. You should correct your bad shape with 'A', then attack 'B' or grab some territory with 'C'.]
;W[rl];B[pf];W[pg];B[pe];W[ng];B[qg]LB[lh:A]C[AB: This is big but it's an endgame move. It's certainly not time for the endgame now. Safely capturing at 'A' is much better.]
;W[lh];B[kh];W[li]
(;B[mi]C[AB: It's better to sacrifice the two stones now (variation).]
;W[ki]C[AB: Now the game is lost. You have already lost a big group and have no chance to get an equivalent for that. Even worse, you have the weaker stones.]
;B[ph];W[oh];B[og];W[qh];B[pg];W[nh];B[qi];W[oi];B[im];W[jm]
;B[ji];W[kj];B[kf];W[kq];B[mp];W[np];B[lr];W[lo]C[I resigned at this point.

AB: Yes, your situation is hopeless. You should pay close attention to your own weaknesses. It can be very helpful to just connect two groups instead of taking a big territorial point. And you should recognize which stones are important and which are not  and save your own important stones and capture the enemies important stones and care not about useless stones.
