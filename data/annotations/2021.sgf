(;B[kq]LB[cn:b][mq:a]TR[gp][hp][gq][hq]C[Shouldn't black be securing the corners? How can I exploit this?
---
Illume: It's not common to defend a corner after playing at the 4-4 point. [1\] The primary goal is to extend from the corners along the borders. Another goal is to attack the corners of the enemy.

Here you must consider two black options:
Black can attack at O3 and compared to the "usual sequences" (see variation) he will have an advantage if you don't play in the area first. The other thing black wants to do is to improve his framework by adding a stone at one of the marked points.   It's possible to attack black, but it shouldn't be done now (claim more parts of the border first) and it shouldn't be done without support.

I would play at "A" (N3) now and consider "B" (C6) in the near future.

LB[jh:a][lk:b][mq:c]C[At this point black roughly has six of the star points. This seems too aggresive to me. Is it?
---

Illume: I'd say his moves were reasonable until now. In an aggressive game he wouldn't defend at C3 so early. He could have continued with O12 after O9 and O3 after L3 but he preferred to wait and builds his framework.

Right now blacks position is slightly better because the white stones are a bit to close to each other, don't defend their border on the third line and have to accomplish three tasks to make this game even:

White must reduce blacks potential territory while it's possible (e.g. "A", K12), he must attempt to cut the invading black stone ("B", M9) and he should occupy a part of the lower border ("C", N3).]
;W[ke];B[oi];W[pi]C[I want to stop black from getting any of the right side which I've claimed. Especially considering the amount of territory he has claimed.
---
Illume: Very good.];B[qq]
(;W[or]C[I'm thinking to trap black inside the corner and extend my corner out to the side.
---
Illume: The idea is right. There is a very common sequence that is good for both sides which you should examine. [2\] Since you can only trap (and not kill) the black corner you have to decide where it should live an where your wall will be located. After that you can use your wall to build territory or start attacks. I'd suggest to build a wall along the bottom edge. (see variation)

Note than in close fights where both sides will survive it's better to attach stones to each other. Single stones are weak an can be easily attacked.

(;W[oq]C[Again protecting the right side.
---
Illume:Note that both black groups are currently living. You could kill the corner by playing R4 instead and still prevent a connection.]

(;B[no];W[ol];B[qc];W[lj]LB[pc:a][qd:b][lk:c]C[Illume: Reducing the corner at "A" or "B" might be more important. And "C" is a bit stronger than you move.]
;B[qg];W[re]LB[qd:a]TR[qg]C[This move intends to cut off the two black stones and give me access to the edge.
---
Illume: R13 is now dead and the corner is weakened. But I'd prefer a play at "A". (R16)]
;B[jg];W[ml];B[nm];W[nl]C[I think this move encircles two black stones, which is good.
---
Illume: Right, this was an important goal.];B[ll];W[lk];B[kk]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[ie]LB[cc:a][fj:b]C[I want access to the centre and perhaps the top.
---
Illume: A reasonable goal. Alternatively you could try to invade in the corner ("A") or play "B" and let black decide which part of the board he wants to defend first. If you don't want to attack in the undefended part "B" can be still abandoned and used in future threats.]
;B[je];W[jd];B[jf];W[id];B[hf]
(;W[kf]C[Illume: I assume that black is leading by about 50 points even if he doesn't build living groups in your corners. Therefore an offensive approach seems more appropriate. (see variation)]

(;W[li]C[Illume: Again a small move. You should treat such attacks as a challenge: Is it possible to live with minimal losses if you ignore black? Other moves are bigger like M3 M7 or an invasion starting with an an attack near D10.]

(;W[ks]C[Ilume: J2 looks interesting but the black stones along the right side offer too many ko-threats for black. I'd play it anyway because black is winning and a fight gives him opportunities to make a mistake.]
;B[iq]CR[iq]C[I like this move.
---
Illume: Depending on the situation it's sometimes better to have two small weaknesses insead of one potential cutting point after a solid connection. Here the difference to J2 is small since blacks support is thick.]

---
Illume: Right, but as before I'd prefer more pressure against the black stone in the corner with Q17 for example.]

(;B[lb];W[kb];B[qj];W[qk];B[gm]C[Illume: A bigger blunder than F16, btw. But it shows that black knows he's winning and he doesn't want to risk anything.]
;W[hr];B[fr];W[gq];B[jp];W[ho]C[Black's territory is large and I need to attack before there is no room to create life.
---
Illume: Your can allways kill and connect at J1 if necessary. Your goal is to reduce territory, not to create life. This attitude explains why your moves after F7 were rather weak.]
;B[gr];W[hq];B[fp];W[go]CR[go]C[I was proud of this move.

---
Illume: Neither was Q7 a neutral point. Black had already passed and wanted to end the game. Since you wanted to continue he had to assume that there were some weakness in the area where you sacrificed a stone. If I were playing black against an equal opponent I'd capture at O7, "just in case".

Black made serious mistakes in the defense of the lower right part of the board. Still you coudn't win since black invaded most of you territory. Blacks invasions were relatively easy because your stones were on the fourt and fifth line, and couldn't do much for your territory. I think you should concentrate on the third and fourth line in your next games and if you don't like it consider a more aggressive playing style based on influence in the center.]
