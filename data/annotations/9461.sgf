C[Thanks very much in advance for reviewing my game! All kinds of comments are welcome. I have added some of my own questions and comments to the game record.


--

M: Hello! I am MrMoto, around 1d on KGS. It was an interesting game, and I reviewed it mostly for Black. A few general comments:

1) Be careful not to make too many weak connections. At several points in the game you attacked too ambitiously, which left weaknesses that W exploited. Get into the habit of making solid moves that you will thank yourself later on for playing. See comments at 35 and 113.

2) Keep the big picture in mind. Both players fought over small details in the lower left (see the fight leading up to move 90), when they should have been concerned over the lower right.

3) The upper right corner was a fiasco!

I hope this review helps!];B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qn];W[qj]
;B[oc]LB[np:A][nq:B][qq:C]C[I had a hard time finding a real response to R10, so played more or less tenuki

--

M: As a follow-up to R6, you could take the opportunity to make a double approach at A or B, or jump in the corner.]
;W[qg]C[not really a good move by white, I guess. Moving towards my strong position.

--

M: Maybe not so bad. It's certainly better than extending downwards, because there's only enough room to jump to R8 ... but in that case, W should have just played R8 directly instead of R10.]

LB[on:D][pn:A][mo:C][np:B]C[M: The lower-right corner doesn't look resolved. If W were to play at A, he'd have a strong position on the right (and you can see that his extension to R13 isn't so bad). White could also consider forcing at B or C. Given that W is choosing not to do so, you can keep in mind jumping out to D at some point, or playing at B yourself, for example, depending on how things go.]
;B[fd];W[bd];B[ch];W[ef];B[cc];W[cj]C[here I was a bit puzzled. I think it is normal for W to not play so tight.]

(;B[bi]LB[eh:A][di:B]C[is this OK? I wanted to prevent W from connecting underneath.

--

M: This is unwise. Now W can connect, or at least become thick, on the outside by playing at the vital point B. Either jump out at A, or play at B to prevent the connection underneath.]

(;W[bj];B[dg]C[playing kakari here so I could jump out one line further. Is this OK, or does it make W too strong?

;B[ie]LB[ic:A][id:B]C[M: This looks like it might cause problems later on. Safer would be at A or B.]
;W[hg];B[gg];W[if];B[ff];W[fe];B[ee]C[Big mistake by me to go for the ko, I think. My group is threatened as well, and there arent any good threats on the board yet.

--

M: Indeed. Compare this to the variation at move 46, where W keeps things simple.]
;W[gd]LB[ic:B][ie:A]C[M: You would now prefer that A were at B instead.]
;B[fc];W[gc];B[bc];W[jd];B[fp]LB[np:B][fq:A]C[M: The lower approach, A, is almost always better. (And then aim at B next.)]
;W[fq];B[ep]LB[gq:A]C[M: This move helps W. If you had a large-scale plan for the centre, then something like this may be warranted, but as it is, this is too close to the stones above, and you don't have a wall on the right, for example. You should be looking at territory along the bottom. Simply play A instead—in which case you can see why you might as well have started with the low approach at F3.]
;W[eq];B[do];W[co];B[gq];W[dn];B[dq];W[eo]
(;B[fo]LB[np:A]C[M: I think you're playing this move to connect to the stones above and to prevent W from breaking into the centre. But for the centre to be a reasonable aim, I would suggest that you first have a strong position on the right side—imagine a stone at A! The weak points in the bottom left also give W a lot of room to manoeuvre. So, instead of F5, what if you just capture the two white stones?]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[cr];B[fr]LB[gr:A]C[M: Playing at A makes the same threat but leaves you more secure.]
;W[er]LB[np:A]C[I think I could have done better here, white's corner+side is too big. I think I should have been able to cut him, but in return I have nice center influence.

--

M: Compare to the variations at 79. Now that you have made a wall on the left, strengthen the right!]
;B[en];W[gr]C[M: White is helping you eliminate your weak points.]
;B[hr];W[fs];B[hq];W[do];B[mo]LB[np:A]SQ[nq]C[Is my direction right here?

--

M: Yes, and both players would have benefited from playing around here earlier. (White's last move in particular doesn't seem to have a purpose, and you're lucky that he didn't play here instead.) That being said, I would prefer playing at A, because it helps strengthen the marked stone. You'll see that the weak connection here becomes a liability later in the game.]
;W[ho]LB[on:A]C[Big mistake by W, I guess

--

M: Yes, W would be safer attending to the right side. For your part, you could consider jumping to A next. Let W connect underneath if he needs to.]
;B[rn];W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[ql];W[nm];B[lm]C[M: Safer to connect at T5.]
