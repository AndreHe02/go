Hi, this is your faithful reviewer jantje.
I'll be reviewing chiefly for White.
From playing the game through a few times, my impression is that opening and middle game led to reasonably balanced play, though with errors from both sides. When endgame started, W seemed to be a little ahead but in what followed he lost the thread, a couple of stones and the game -- perhaps time pressure or tiredness played a role here.
(j)];B[pp];W[dd];B[do];W[pd];B[cf];W[eq]LB[dq:A]C[Possible, but still this hands the corner to B and is gote. Why not A? (j)]
;B[cq];W[hq];B[qf];W[nd]LB[nc:A][qh:B]C[This was something like the "officially best" move in the seventies. Nowadays, people often play either A or a pincer. Nothing wrong with the move played, but it is hard to follow up because it leaves open possibilities of either attacking or making territory, and one has to choose wisely... (j)]
;B[kc]LB[lc:A][oc:B]C[Black is playing in a decidedly provocative style. The old handicap game move is A, Black has a similar idea but his move is less well suited to take advantage of the weakness at B.
But what should W do about it? 
I am not sure myself, but the variations (pincering either of the B stones without strengthening them) might be best. (j)]

(;W[pf]C[This is probably not best because it strengthens the lone B stone, which could otherwise have become a target for attack. See variations for a suggestion. (j)]
;B[qe];W[qd];B[pg];W[of];B[nb]C[The 5 white stones are not effective enough (j)]
;W[ic];B[gc]C[Now this is really an overplay if you ask me (j)]
;W[jb]LB[jd:A]C[A is probably better. If W plays a one point jump,  B can connect under (as I'm sure you noticed) (j)]
;B[kb];W[ie]C[OK, keeps B separated (j)];B[ke];W[ld]C[There is no strong reason to play this peep now, which by itself is a reason not to play it. (j)]
;B[kd]LB[id:A]C[In some cases A becomes an interesting move for B (j)]
;W[jf];B[mc];W[fd];B[gd];W[ge];B[cc];W[fc];B[cd]LB[lg:A][md:B]
C[White has bought safety for his group at the expense of a corner, and still has sente. Now, should W play A or B? (j)]

(;W[md]C[Wrong answer. See variation. 
A Go proverb says "Sacrifice kikashi (forcing) stones without regret" and that is what you should have done (j)]
;B[lf];W[mg];B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[qg]C[Better to march on, regardless (j)]
;B[qh];W[rg];B[ph]C[Well done by B! (j)];W[re];B[mi]LB[lg:A]
C[Do you see how much worse this is compared to W playing the marked point? (j)]
;W[qn];B[rh];W[rf];B[ql];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro]
;W[rq];B[rn];W[nq];B[np];W[mq]C[Having pushed once, B should now continue pushing (j)]
;B[jq]C[It is his nature (j)];W[kp]LB[ho:A]C[This is bad shape, as will become clear in a moment. It is also the wrong side to play: the two stones on the left are weak and need help, whereas the corner is stable enough. (j)]
;B[jp];W[ko];B[hp];W[gp];B[ho];W[gr]LB[iq:A]C[Must be at A, as in the joseki (j)]
;B[go];W[ir];B[kq]LB[kp:A]C[This shows that A was bad shape, the connection makes an empty triangle (j)]
;W[lp];B[fp]C[W has suffered here, the lower left group is still weak and B has become thick (j)]
;W[fq]LB[dr:A]C[B should immediately continue at A, yummy points in sente (j)]
;B[mn];W[ni]C[Almost forced, but will it work? (j)]
(;B[mj];W[nj];B[oi]LB[pj:A][nh:B]C[A good example of aji-keshi (spoiling your own possibilities). After Black A, the cut at B remains viable. (j)]
;W[nh];B[ok];W[oj];B[pj];W[nk];B[ol];W[cm]LB[dr:A]C[Good point, B should still react at A, and then a pincer.]
;B[cn];W[ck]C[Well done! W's best move in the game (j)];B[bm]
;W[dm]LB[ch:A]C[I would have played A for W, make him feel a bit silly (j)]
;B[bl];W[ek];B[ji]LB[li:A]C[Black apparently fears the cut at A. Without justification, it would seem (j)]
;W[ih]C[I do not see the purpose of this move (j)];B[mk];W[ch]
C[White still gets to the biggest point first, the game should now be OK for him (j)]

;W[gg];B[gh];W[fi];B[hg];W[hc];B[ii];W[hh]C[Black is in a generous mood (j)]

Summary:
- W did not play very effectively in the upper right (moves 12 and 34)
- Black missed the cut at O12 when White played O11
- Black should not have gotten so much thickness in the lower left, but then he did not make good use of it
- the important point D2 was left up for grabs for a long time
- B tried to achieve unspecified ends in the upper left, all he did was lose some stones
- W adroitly neutralized Black's thickness on the left side.

After all that, W should have won but he lost out in the centre fight.

Thanks for the opportunity to review your game, have fun playing Go (jantje)]
