Hello, you played a good game, but failed to manage white invasions effectively :) Also missed to defend some cuts. I hope my commentaries can help you!
Feel free to mail me if you have more questions! :)];W[pp];B[dd]

;W[qn]
(;B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[iq]C[it worked.


this is way too far, L3 is standard joseki after Q2, K4 without Q2 is also possible and simple]

(;W[jd]
(;B[cj]C[claiming the left side with variety of 3rd and 4th lines.

Usually 4th line (sanrensei) is better here, aiming for a big moyo if white invades 3-3]
;W[fc];B[cf];W[hd]C[didnt feel the need to respond to this, so wanted to strengthen my corner]
;B[nc];W[qc]C[i fail at many 3-3 invasions, not sure what the best move is here.]
;B[qd]C[blocking him from going down seemed like a good idea.

This is the only move :)];W[pc]C[White can't live in the corner with this move]
