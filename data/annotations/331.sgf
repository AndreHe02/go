[pi]C[[J\]: The left side is bigger at this point.
Black gets away with this move because White
responds but ...];W[ri];B[rj]C[[J\] ... Black should play on the left here
instead, since his right side stones are all
strong enough.];W[cj];B[gc];W[ge]C[[J\] This is a good point, but it is gote
and a play on the bottom or lower left
corner is bigger.];B[fq];W[fp]C[[J\] I'd consider E3 instead, after B F4
(the standard response) White still has
N3 for a base or K5 to run and so has good
responses to any Black followup even if
W just C/D6 after B F4. Also see comments
a couple of moves from now.];B[gp];W[mq]C[[J\] Of course you never know what the opponent
will do for sure, but when White played F4,
Black G4 is a very common response - if White
was going to play here (N3) when B G4, then
F4 was probably not the best response. Once F4
was played, then White should abandon K3 for at
least a few moves and finish out the bottom corner
sequence. K3 has a lot of aji, even after Black
reinforces G4, for example: a move in the M/N 5/6
area, threatening to save K3 can be used to invade
the lower right side if Black foils the rescue.];B[ep];W[eo]C[[J\] Letting Black take F4 so easily requires
more compensation. D3 trades the corner for
the ponnuki. Or F5 leaves cuts at E3 and G3 for
Black to deal with.];B[fo];W[en];B[dq];W[cp];B[mp];W[lp];B[lq];W[lr]C[[J\] M3 was a Black sacrifice to help enclose
the right side and corner. M2 just helps Black
along. Better to fight back at N5 or O4 or even
ignore these stones for a few moves and play
reducing moves against the right side.];B[nq];W[mr];B[lo];W[kp];B[mn];W
[fn]C[[J\] White is one stone ahead of Black here,
and so would be happy if Black pushed here
(F6) so White can play at E7. Getting pushed
along the fifth line here would be great for
White! This move would be better played around F10.];B[gn];W[gm];B[eh];W
[ch]C[[J\] Too passive, attacking this stone at
E/F 10 would enclose the lower left side,
and the upper left corner is not in danger.
Chasing this stone out into the center would
give White much improved influence.];B[ej];W[dk];B[ef];W[ee];B[df];W[de]
;B[gh];W[hn]C[[J\] This move is not quite strong enough to
be a certain sente. I would have continued
the attack on the E12 group at J14 or H13
first. Then use H6 to continue the attack,
depending on Black's response.];B[cq];W[bq]C[[J\] This is more of an end game move and
will leave White in gote, it does weaken
Black but after Black B2, Black should be
able to take sente and survive any later
attack here.];B[br];W[bp];B[go];W[rl]C[[J\] With correct play, I'd think Black can
kill this stone. Better to reduce around O/P8
or O9. Even if White survives, Black's attack
will leave stones which dominate the center.];B[ol];W[ro];B[rp];W[qo];B

[fe];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[db];B[ci];W[bi];B[dj];W[bk]C[[J\] Taking at D10 instead leaves Black with

[hd];B[id];W[fc];B[ga];W[ph]C[[J\] This helps Black. If you really want to
break out here, then P15 first. (If P15 is
ignored, then W P17 next is good for White -
try it and see.) If Black prevents P17, then
White P13 breaks out.];B[oh];W[og];B[qh];W[rh]C[[J\] At this point, let Black have RS11 and
play P15.];B[pg];W[qg];B[ng];W[ek];B[jl];W[kh]C[

[[J\] Looks to me like White could set up a
ko fight at this point with W J17, B H17,
W K17, B H16, W J18. It's a big loss for
Black but almost nothing to White, so the
ko is good for White.     Also, it looks to me like, instead of K10:
W K12, B J13, W J11, B H13, W G13, B H12, W K10
lets White ruin the Black center (although Black
can still turn the tables if White stumbles after
this.)];B[ij];W[il];B[im];W[hm];B[hk];W[hl];B[jm];W[hq];B[bf];W[be];B[gr]
