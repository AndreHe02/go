Dear reviewer, hello !

I am Black in this 5-stone game, played on KGS go server.

it were very close game, until he make blunder after 200 moves, and he must resign there.

when i review this game myself, i found i done very much of peep and cut/attempt to cut, i feel some of that kind of moves are  "thank u move". please make some comments if u found that moves.

and please look at for my closing move too, i think i lost much point there, and any other comment are welcome.:)

Thank you very much for your time, patience and insight.];W[nc]

TR[fc][dd][fe][df][fg]C[Y: my first attempt to cut. it`s look bad doesn`t it?
Yes a poor result for B here.  The black stones are somewhat weak compared to the whiten stones so attaching at G15 is too much]

(;B[ck]C[perhaps just play at C16 to make territory and secure group]
;W[bl];B[fj]C[Y:my first thinking is move in B9, but maybe because B15 still open running to the center more worth.
your comment?

I think the C9 B8 exchange was better for white.  Going to center is better now]

(;B[dl]C[Perhaps at E6 is better.  Now white must help the group and black starts to secure an enormous corner]

Yes because of Q10];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]

(;B[nf]C[This weakens the L17 group too much.  See the threads]
;W[mf];B[of]C[Y: I am taking much time here, maybe play N15 safer way, but i want to shut his O17 group before he destroy my N7 moyo.
what do you think?

The moyo wasnt threatened and you lose a lot on top as the group becomes endangered]

The game has become pretty close.
Taking the corner at A means cut at D is not important.
B & C are big sente moves reducing white
E is sente for white so it is also big for black
F secures life for the left side group in sente
Black can easily win if gets a few of these points];B[hi];W[gi]
