(;B[fq]C[its more normal to play in the area where theere is more potential to make territory. in this case between the 2 white stones is a smaller area than along the side, as shown. but still, if it's followed up as part of alogical plan it can be ok]

playing in the areas where you can live and make the most points. obviously lotss of reading praactice helps you to be able to do this

3-3 point and play in these regions

learn to scarifice 1 or 2 stone for the better of many more.
