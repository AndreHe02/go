i dont understand your comment... this looks like an ordinary move?];B[nq]
;W[qn];B[jp];W[co]LB[do:A][dn:B]C[currently people mostly play at 'a' or 'b', the reason is they
attack the corner less directly, so it is also harder to attack them,
this because black is stronger at the bottom.
anyway matter of taste];B[dk]
(;W[cq]MA[dk]C[i dont think this is good. the goal of it is to settle very quickly,
and this after you decided to attack the corner, also because the marked stone is further away than usual.
personally i would play var B]
(;B[dp]C[took me by surprise. normal is var B];W[cp];B[do];W[dn];B[en]
(;W[em]C[bene:anyway good feeling double hane

i think overplay...];B[dm];W[cn]LB[fn:A][el:B]C[bene:i think f6 is best
i agree]
(;B[el];W[eo]C[you know it is not normal to give a ponnuki in the centre?
:)];B[fm]LB[hp:A]C[bene: i added var2of var2 & var3: in var2 i think black can have good influence, var3(which was my original reading) seek to avoid it.

yep. probably you played the best variation actually. somehow
i didn't consider him building this influence. :)
actually also it is good, because you have a sever move at 'a'  later.]

(;W[fn]C[i think B better.];B[fp];W[em];B[dc];W[en]MA[fp]C[bene: good feeling to break thru black.
yes, but also the marked stone is quite vital.];B[gd]LB[cg:A]C[should be 'a', take away base and make base at the same time.]
;W[dh]C[bene:high to attack black later

sure, low would be too low here. :)];B[cd]LB[fh:A][hp:B]C[very bad. b takes gote while making white strong. bene: then attack where? i.e. F12?

for example f12 would be a good move to attack, but if i were black
i would have played at 'b' to defend quickly. a white move there is
very severe.];W[de];B[bd]LB[fd:A][ec:B]C[should be 'a'. now white has a move at 'b' (bad aji)]

too early.];W[ch];B[fl];W[hn];B[hp]C[it's a pity he got this point.];W[hl]

i put a suggestion var2 next move.]

the shape is not terrific. but...
i think it's a good move.];B[gj]

chance to cut the 5 stones off. 'a' will strengthen your group a  little bit in sente.]
;B[hm]C[bene: bad move i think];W[gm];B[dg];W[eh];B[qj]LB[ji:A][ff:B][ec:C]
C[bene: k11 maybe more severe

yes i agree. note also that 'b' is not small, as it removes aji at  'c'.]

lower group too much)];B[hd]LB[fd:A]C[black must play at 'a'.];W[qf]LB[kn:A]
C[inconsistent. from here you set many new groups (weak) on the board.
why not 'a' and keep on attacking?];B[he]LB[nd:A]C[strange move. maybe just 'a' is OK?]

i agree. the proverb said, dont give ponnuki. now your group is
OK again.];B[pr];W[qq];B[lk];W[jg];B[ke];W[mg];B[qr];W[rr];B[ql];W[on];B

this is indeed funny. i added a move :) this is of course not
the only variation, but the variation with the toughest resistance.]

this is not the vital point. look var B. maybe 'a' also a good
move.];B[lq];W[mq];B[mp]
