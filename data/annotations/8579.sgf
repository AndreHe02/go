C[Hello: My name is Shane, (smonds3- 1d on KGS). My comments will be with S*. 

There seemed to be biggest problem in some opening joseki choices and both players failed to take advantage. In opening, slightly wrong choices must be taken advantage of early otherwise opponent might be able to fix weakness and then it becomes a very good opening move. (see the game comments later)

_____________
Thanks for reviewing my game.

I played Black in this game.

Looking over this game myself, I can see a few moves that I made that I would call bad moves (particularly the one that allowed Black to get cut apart in the upper left).  However, I feel like my loss in this game was more a result of cumulative not-so-good moves rather than obviously bad moves.  These are more frustrating for me because I feel that I might not be able to avoid the same kind of not-so-good move in the future.

I would appreciate any advice you can give me to improve.];B[dp]
;W[pd];B[dc];W[ce];B[pp]C[S*: 

Great. Take open corner is biggest (can easily tenuki the 1v1 in the upper left)

Considering that the approach was at C15 white takes the stance of preventing territory. So this game is likely to not be a 'moyo' game. So ni-ren-sei on the bottom seems little out of character. Nothing wrong, but I'd like to choose a more territorial move like san-san or komoku for the lower right corner.

Black can hope for more territory in that strategy since he got three opening corners and white's 1 open corner is 4-4.

Here by taking 4-4, black is maybe hoping to fight more and use his extra high development on the bottom to his advantage. Still too early to tell of course ;)]
;W[qn];B[np]LB[fc:a][pj:b][on:c]C[A might be a decent tenuki 
B is simple and fine.

C is actual game, not quite correct.]
(;W[on]LB[np:7][qi:a][dh:b][ci:c][cg:d]C[S* : This move is a little strange play by W. Usually you must have a stone around A to play like this. But if black tenuki's now then it becomes advantageous for W.

Black must play around A immediatly because if white gets there, then this will be to W's advantage. If white cannot play on the right, then black benefited more by the exchange of moves 7-8.

Black continues at D which seems not ideal. Locally in the upper left a pincer at B or C is better to develop the D4 stone.]
(;B[cg]C[S*: Firstly, the right side is very important.

Secondly, close pincer is good for developing the top side 3-4 stone because when white jumps out, black can move onto the 4th line. (see variations for more explanation). Here though the top isn't as developable because white is at Q16. 

Black should choose a high distant pincer to work with the D4 stone (see variations]
;W[ee];B[fd]LB[hd:a][dh:b][fe:c]C[Here the close pincer allows B to move onto the 4th line if white jumps out. But.... The top side isn't developable for B because white is at Q16 so this move can be countered pretty easily

A is probably best option for W. Because the support of developing the Q16 stone. 
B is also joseki but black is much happier with B.
C, actual game, helps black the most.]
(;W[fe]C[S*: This push helps black so much! It is nearly unthinkable to give 4th line territory here.]
;B[gd]
(;W[dg]C[S*: Now white touches black's weak stone helping it. If white pushed on the top to get stronger. He needs to attack (although not entirely appropriate given whole board).

White should attack black stone at C13, not touch it--- giving it more liberties.]
;B[ch];W[dh];B[cj];W[di]LB[ck:a][ci:b]C[A is better than B (actual game]

A seems to work fine.

(;B[bo];W[ep];B[do];W[fq]LB[kq:a]C[Defending the bottom group becomes important for Black with white's new ponnuki.]
(;B[nc];W[oc]C[This move is very bad by W. It helps black and doesn't close corner.]
(;B[nd]
(;W[lq]LB[or:a][nr:b][mo:c][rp:d]C[A, might look strange but it makes a base and prevents the 3-3 invasion.
B, is possible, but the 3-3 becomes bad aji.
C, gets out but  it is difficult to attack white, so black becomes floating. This is why black must settle
D, actual game still allow white to rob black of a base]
(;B[rp]C[I never really know what to do in this sort of situation.  It seems like it warrants a response because otherwise White can seal in Black, but at the same time, what should the response be?  I feel moving somewhere in the corner to make life is passive and doesn't threaten white.  Playing N5 to run out to the center also seems like it gives White a weak group to attack.]
;W[nr];B[or]LB[oq:a][nq:b]C[White played B which helped black.

A can be possible.]
(;W[nq];B[oq];W[jc]LB[pe:a][je:b]C[S* : HUGE overplay by W.

Black gets a chance.
Playing at A sees white's intentions and is good forcing.
Attacking at B is good, but make some preparations first.]
(;B[je]C[I felt that if I didn't start moving into the center, White could use his influence on the L side to great effect in the center.  So I decided to try to shut White in at the top.]
;W[lc];B[le];W[hc];B[he];W[ld];B[me];W[fb]LB[gb:a][cd:b][eb:c]
C[A, sometimes is a move that can be considered if white is alive allowing to connect  in sente. 
B, is a move i'd consider, locally valuable
C, actual game - is sub par but doesn't have to be terrible for black]
(;B[eb]C[This move enabled my opponent to cut apart the two black groups.  It probably would have been better to stay connected with a move at E17 or E16, or maybe threaten to cut white by playing at D16.

S: you're not yet cut here (see var)];W[fc]LB[ed:a][ec:b]C[A, will connect

(;B[pj]C[-This move, while it seems large, probably wasn't as urgent as the point at B15.

S: Actually this is side is important. Play low please to make territory and base. If high here need two more moves to settle this stone. This isn't proper way to move on the empty side. High moves are good for making moyo or reducing large moyos. Here 3rd line is more appropriate.]

Focus on opening of this game, and look to make moves that score more points in middle game.
In a peaceful game like this where there are no major groups in mortal danger, one must play very good opening and try to score more points in middlegame.
