[0];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pq]C[A small  nit, but I don't really like Q3.  It invites Q5, which is a perfect
move for black.];B[qo];W[qp]C[With R3, you are asking for small territory in  the corner in exchange for
outside influence for black.  Since that outside influence works well with
black's Q16, this is not good for white.  I would prefer a pincer, like Q8  instead, although that leads to lots of fighting.  A simpler course might be
P4 or O4, which works better with the D4 stone.];B[op]
(;W[mq]C[N3 is too far  out.  I'm not sure even O3 is possible, although it would be really  awful to push at P3 and give black so much influence.  I might try to thwart  black's
aim with Q4, followed by a cut.  This is really ugly, but better than being  hemmed
into the corner with no recourse.  See the variation.];B[pp];W[qq];B[pm]
;W[cf]C[Dangerous to leave the lower right as it is.  If I were black, I  would  ignore C14 and go P3 right now.  A cutting point like this is a real  liability.
White just gets tiny life in the corner, and N3 becomes a big target.];B
[ce]
(;W[dj]C[C15 was really not a good move for black, but white lets him get away  with it.
C14 is under severe attack; you can't cut him loose.  D14 is almost mandatory  (although E14 might be playable).  D10 offers black the long sente  sequence, which
he plays with delight.  Sure, white gets some territory on the left, but  black's
wall is invaluable.

Variation 1 shows the standard joseki, which is great for white.];B[df]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[dh];W[di];B[cn]
(;W[fp]C[This seems just a little slack.  It is  often the right move, but in this case
(with the fairly strong white group above, I would attack vigorously.
I'd go for either C5 or B5 (the stylish foot-sweep).  See variation.];B
[cp];W[cq];B[do];W[ep];B[eo];W[cl];B[dl];W[cm];B[dm];W[fc]C[Two comments:

First, I would keep badgering black's lower left group for a while.
If nothing else, B4 is probably sente.  Also black C9 looks kind of scary.

Second, if you want to enter the upper side, F17 seems a little too close to
black's thick wall.  If black were going to play on the upper side, he would
probably go for K16.  Consequently, that would be a good point for white,  too.]
;B[fd];W[jc]C[Oops!  Don't abandon F17 so soon.  G16 would be good here.    K17 is a little too far to connect comfortably.  Black G17
would leave the white stones either cut apart, or smooshed
completely against the edge.];B[jd]C[This is a poor move by black.  A general  rule is that contact plays are  for desperate defense.  White shouldn't let himself get plastered to the
edge here.  I'd follow this up with J16.];W[hc];B[hd]
(;W[jp]C[Although this is  a fair point, it's too early to leave the upper side.
Black L17 would seal you in with small life and give black a huge moyo in
the upper left.  You should probably play something like variation 1...]
;B[jo];W[cc];B[ec];W[eb];B[gc];W[fb];B[gd]C[Dumb luck here. G16 is a bad move  by black; G18 would leave white sliced apart.]
;W[gb];B[ic];W[fh];B[fg];W[gh];B[gg];W[hb];B[hh];W[fk]C[Well, you managed to get a good result to here,  although some of the intervening
moves were a little suspicious.  I'm uneasy about leaving J18, which is huge.]
;B[hk];W[qf];B[nd]
(;W[qj]C[Given all the black thickness, this might be a  little too loose.  I'd go for something
a little tighter, like the joseki shown in the variation.];B[oj];W[ph];B
[oh];W[qd];B[og];W[ib];B[id];W[gm]C[Black's center moyo is looking scary, and L17  would really seal it in.  I think L17
for W now would pick up some points in sente.];B[go];W[im];B[io];W[hp];B
[ho];W[dk];B[fo];W[fl];B[kp];W[jq];B[mp];W[nq];B[np];W[kn];B[ko];W[km];B
[ip];W[hq];B[iq];W[ir];B[jr];W[hr];B[kq]C[In retrospect we see that many of the  preceeding moves along the bottom were
in vain.  The problem was that black was too thick, and white was too thin.
Would have been better to spend those moves breaking into the center, or
taking the upper left corner.  Now, black is nice and safe everywhere...]
;W[lq];B[lp];W[lr]C[This move is way too small...];B[kr]C[And black should  not answer it!]

C[In the end, it looks like you would have won  if it were not for the two little endgame
blunders...  (This happens to me all too often.)])
(;W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]C[This leaves you with a very stable group right in the middle of  black's moyo.]
))
(;W[kd];B[je];W[ke]C[The point here is not to  let black connect the upper left to the upper right...]
))
(;W[co];B[dn];W[fp]C[Joseki says black should play D10 now, but white has a  stone there!  Thus, black
can't follow the joseki, which by definition must be bad.  Black has a heavy  little  group surrounded by white stones: a perfect target!]
))
(;W[df];B[fd];W[dj]C[This is a standard joseki, but is probably good for white in  this case, since
it works perfectly with D4.  Also blacks upper left corner is open to invasion
(later -- much later) at C17.  A great result for white.  Compare this  carefully  to the result actually obtained in the game]
