Possibly - however the ineffectiveness of R16 is black's real problem here.

p14 is the right general idea - but probably the wrong move it sort of falls between two stools

Better choices are at A - splitting white more securely - and leaving no chance of black being cut in two later

Did you think you had killed the group?


Overall I think you lost because you ignored the potential of white's lower moyo.
You had several opportunities to do something. esp at move 25, 81 and 91.You loat because you didn't take these opportunities.

When you did get around to it you went in too deep - and in a way that didn't build your own moyo.]
