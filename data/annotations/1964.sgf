GC[GTL review requested by Black]

C[I dont really have any comments, because I
have only been playing a week and don't
anything to comment about. The same is for
my opponent so neither of us are very good.
Thanks.

MM: You're welcome. :-)];B[pd];W[qp];B[cc];W[dp];B[op];W[pp]
TR[mp][lp][lq][mq]SQ[pn][pm][qm][qn]C[MM: Until this, the opening has been quite normal -- good moves which have proven themselves for decades or centuries. This White move seems odd. Touching the Black stone like this will probably start a fight in which both sides add stones and get stronger. White is close to the side and already pretty strong; so White would like to not help Black get strong. Instead of this Q4, we usually see White making a pincer near one of the triangles (N3-M4), or forming a base with one of the squares (Q6-R7).]
;B[oo];W[oq];B[nq];W[pr]C[MM: Perhaps too conservative. White at P2 should be ok, and then Black wouldn't be able to make the P2 atari. Perhaps even better would be to tenuki and take a big point elsewhere, and be willing to sacrifice one small stone.]
;B[or]TR[fq][gq][gp][fp][jp][jq][qn][qf][pf][pg][qg][cj][ci]
[ic][jc][jd][id]C[MM: Too small, at this early stage of the game. Even if Black captures the stone, White should be able to make a living group in the corner. How about something near one of the triangles instead?]
;W[nd]C[MM: Good, rightly willing to sacrifice a stone or two in the lower right, in exchange for making a big move somewhere else.]
;B[nc]TR[lc][ld][kc][kd][qf][pf][qg][pg]C[MM: I think this is a joseki move, and therefore ok; but I would prefer to attack from a slight distance (triangles).]
;W[cn]C[MM: This is a big and important move, but it feels too soon to walk away from the skirmish in the upper right. Whoever gets the next move there can gain a big advantage.]
;B[fq]C[MM: This is a good move if White does not have C6 yet, I think; but since the shimari (loose corner enclosure) has been made already, I'm not sure if this is good. Now it feels too close to White's strength and too far from Black's strength; and it's White's move.]
;W[jp]C[MM: So white gets to make the shimari AND the loose pincer. This should be an interesting fight; but I think White has an advantage.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[hq];W[dj]TR[go][gn]C[MM: Is White giving up the K4 stone? I hope not; that's an important stone, pressing Black low on the bottom. White would like to keep pressuring the Black stones on the lower left, thereby building a thick wall that faces the center; *then* make this jump, staking out a huge corner and left side. But since White jumps up before building the wall, Black can have it pretty easy by jumping to either G5 or G6 (triangles), and cutting off the K4 stone.]
;B[fd]C[MM: A big move; but I would prefer to cut off the K4 stone first.]
;W[pq]C[MM: Too small, too soon.];B[pk]C[MM: Good! Black doesn't care about one measly little P2 stone at this stage of the game; and now Black has the beginnings of a huge moyo. Things are looking up for Black.]
;W[cr];B[fo]C[MM: Good];W[lp]TR[np]C[MM: Interesting; now the cutting point at O4 (triangle) may become important, because Black's ladder (N4) no longer works.]
;B[jr];W[cg]C[MM: White likes to tenuki. That's two potentially large fights that White has abandonded in favor of a big point elsewhere. Sometimes that's a good policy; here it seems to violate the proverb "don't have two weak groups on the board".]
;B[ce]TR[md][pf][lc][ld][kc][mc][qf][of][oc]C[MM: My feeling is that Black doesn't need to answer here. This is big, but not vital; and a move at one of the triangles would be even bigger.]
;W[jc];B[lq]TR[lr][mp][kq][fm][em][km][kn]SQ[md][lc][hc]C[MM: It's good to continue the fight here, but for the moment I think the upper side is more important.  Anyway, this move seems to hurt Black more than helps, because it doesn't protect against the O4 cut, and it introduces new cutting points for White to exploit (L3, N3, perhaps even J3 now); and White's natural follow-up moves will give White good shape. This would probably be better at one of the triangles; or on the upper side (squares).]
;W[kp]TR[kq]C[MM: Probably stronger at L3];B[kq]TR[np]C[MM: Well, Black came out of that OK after all. Black is connected, and the 3 White stones provide a target for attack. Black shouldn't expect to kill, necessarily; rather Black will be happy to use the attack to build strong walls that will help claim the right and upper sides. (Of course, if capturing the whole group becomes possible, go for it.) But, Black still has a weak point - if White cuts at O4, things may be tough for Black. M3 and L3 don't do much to defend that O4 cut.]
;W[gc]C[MM: Good. White does better to make a base in a relatively empty area, than to fight at a disadvantage on the lower side.]
;B[gd];W[lc]TR[lq]C[MM: White's pretty well settled on the upper side now. This would not have happened so easily, if Black 31 had been on the top instead of at M3.]
;B[hc];W[mb];B[oc];W[bf];B[df];W[of];B[pf];W[ie];B[id];W[oe]
;B[pe];W[mc];B[nb];W[ib];B[hb];W[jd];B[ic]TR[fm][dh][je][og]
[qn][pn][qm][em][dl][ph][oh]C[MM: I don't like this; too small. I prefer one of the triangled spots.]
;W[em];B[fm];W[fk];B[ei]TR[jp][kp][lp]SQ[hl][gl]C[MM: This feels like the wrong side. If Black can keep the 3 whites at L4 (triangles) surrounded on a grand scale, Black should have an easy win, I think. So, I think at one of the squares (G8 or H8) would be better.]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[ej]TR[hk]C[MM: Why not H9?];B[gi]TR[gk][hk]C[MM: I think better to cut White more firmly at one of the triangles. This seems to leave too many chances for White to cut Black instead.]
;W[hn]C[MM: Now Black's cutting points will hurt, because White gets to make dual-purpose moves. If Black connects his stones together, White gets another move with which to make living shape; but if Black moves to spoil White's shape, then White can save herself by cutting off a few Black stones and connecting to the White living left side.]
;B[in];W[el];B[gk];W[fj];B[gj]C[MM: Wow, White let Black get out of that sticky spot. Black now seems firmly in the lead.]
;W[fi];B[fh];W[di]TR[eh]C[MM: Why not atari from the other side (E12)?]
;B[eh];W[dg];B[eg];W[be]TR[qm][pg][oh][qi][gp]SQ[ac]C[MM: Small (one of the triangles would be bigger), and aji-keshi since Black's obvious response ruins the chance for the monkey-jump to A17 (square) later on. "Monkey jump is worth 12 points", says the proverb.]
;B[bd];W[fn];B[gn];W[hg];B[gh]TR[ii][jj]C[MM: I don't think Black should answer this way. Connection is good, but this seems too slow. Suppose Black went at J11 or K10 instead, and White cut at G12... then Black would still be ok. By making this solid connection, Black may give White the opportunity to do something tricky to rescue the isolated stones.]
;W[eq]C[MM: E2 would get more points on the side; but this way, White may be able to cut at F2 or F4. But since Black is connected overall, the F2 / F4 cut no longer seems very valuable anyway.]
;B[er];W[dh]C[MM: ? Why play E3 instead of E2, if not to follow up with F4 or F2?  This D12 is only worth one point; bigger plays abound.]
;B[cf]TR[ii][ij][jj][pn][qn][ph][do][og][oh][qm][io]C[MM: A bad move... it's not important; it's small; it's bad shape; and it's gote (White doesn't have to respond, so White has the freedom to make an important play in another part of the board). One of the triangled points would be better, I think.]
;W[mn];B[mp];W[lo];B[nk]C[MM: Good!];W[oh];B[ph];W[og];B[pg]
;W[ip];B[hp]TR[in]SQ[hm][jm][ho]C[MM: This feels wrong... I think Black needs to worry about J6 becoming surrounded, and White making two eyes; but Black doesn't need to worry so much about the strong bottom-side stones. I'd recommend one of the square-marked points instead (run away with K7, or atari with H7 or H5).]
;W[io];B[im];W[kn]TR[ko][ln]SQ[lm]C[MM: White's almost alive now, with one eye at L5 and a good chance to make an eye at M6. But Black can probably spoil White's eyeshape by playing at M7.]
;B[hm];W[jm];B[il];W[oi];B[pi];W[oj];B[pj];W[ok];B[ol];W[nl]
;B[mj]C[MM: Seems a bit odd. Why not N9?];W[nm]C[MM: Looks now like White will live, but Black is still ahead overall.]
;B[om];W[mk];B[nj];W[lk];B[lj];W[jn];B[jl];W[kl];B[kj];W[qn]
TR[qm][rm][rl]C[MM: Good move. I think White can even go a line or two further.]
;B[qm];W[rm];B[rk]TR[ql]C[MM: I think this would be better at R8.]
;W[jh]C[MM: Big move];B[kh]C[MM: Good.];W[mg];B[kf]C[MM: Very good!]
;W[md]TR[jj][ji][le][lh][kg][ki][lf]C[MM: ?  Black can't cut there; not sure what White's thinking. I would expect White to fight back with one of the triangled points instead.]
;B[ij]C[MM: Good, eliminates a weakness around K10.];W[je];B[jf]
;W[if];B[ih];W[pn];B[on];W[pm];B[ql];W[jb];B[pl];W[le];B[jg]
;W[eo];B[fp]C[MM: It looks ok to capture at E6 instead; but this is fine too. Black has a commanding lead, and is connected all across the board. White is alive everywhere, but cut into four groups. The game is almost set, except in a few spots: G14, O2, N12, and there may be a chance of White invading the upper right corner. With Black so strong, an invasion probably will die; but with White so far behind, White should attempt it anyway.]
;W[iq];B[ir];W[en];B[ho];W[lf];B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[ke];B[gf]
C[MM: Good];W[he];B[ge];W[ni];B[kk];W[na]C[MM: Aji-keshi... with this, White kills the (slim) possibility of invading, because after Black's natural response at P19, I see no hope for White in the corner.]
;B[oa];W[ma];B[od];W[po];B[nr]C[MM: Good.  Only about 10 or 12 endgame points remain, scattered around the board. All over but the counting.]
;W[gg];B[fg];W[hh];B[hi];W[ds];B[es];W[cs];B[fr]TR[dq]SQ[ll]
C[MM: Necessary, but not just yet because there's still a liberty at D3 (triangle). Black would score more points by exploiting the double atari at M8.]
;W[no];B[np];W[os];B[ns];W[ps];B[jq]TR[rl][ia][ae][ll][ig]C[MM: Better at M8, S8, J13, J19, or A15]
;W[ha];B[gb];W[ll];B[jk]C[MM: Unnecessary; and even loses a point (at least under the Japanese rules).]
;W[hd];B[fc];W[nn];B[fl];W[bp];B[rc];W[db];B[ga];W[cb];B[bb]
;W[ia];B[eb];W[dc];B[dd];W[ea];B[fa];W[ed];B[ec];C[MM: Odd to pass now; the borders are incomplete at N11, and on the lower right and upper left.]
;B[sl];W[rn];B[sm];W[sn];B[rl];W[mi];B[li];W[hf];B[ae];W[bg]
;B[af];W[ag];B[ad];W[dq];B[ig];W[ep];B[mo];C[MM: Including komi, Black wins by 15.5. Overall, an astonishingly good game for players with only a few weeks experience. My main recommendation for improvement at this point is to keep playing more; and maybe Black should watch out for a certain tendency to usually answer in the area where White played, even if it's not the biggest play on the board. And perhaps White should beware a tendency to go too far in the other direction -- playing tenuki too soon instead of striving for an advantage with stones that are in a contact fight.

Other than that, life and death problems will be helpful, such as those at the GTL sister site (www.goproblems.com). You also may find it worthwhile to check out the material at Senseis' Library (the other GTL sister site), http://senseis.xmp.net, which has a special Beginners Section.

Thanks for allowing me to review your game; and welcome to the wonderful world of Go!
