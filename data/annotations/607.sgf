Playing black:korner 8k*
Playing white:Serge 8k*
Result:b by 5.5 pts
Komi: 5.5];B[pp]C[After some prolonged discussions on IGS and rec.games.go it is established that the polite thing to do is to start by playing your first move in the top-right corner - the same "rule" aplays to go-diagrams. This isn't important but...
I thought I'd mention it...];W[dd];B[dq]LB[do:A][dd:B]C[Wrong direction. It's a bit difficult to explain but both B and the stone at 3 wish to extend along the left side, the difference is that the white stone can also extend along the top. The relation between these two stones is therefore favourable for white. White should aproach at A.
Black 3 should be played at c4.]
(;W[pd]C[In my view white misses his chance here.

see variation];B[co]C[ Playing with 5.5 komi, should Black have been more agressive than making its lower left corner secure by C5?

No. This is the proper move - honte. Making a shimary like this is never bad for black.]

(;W[qn]LB[jq:A]C[Wrong direction - this should be at A. Black must not be allowed to play here - actually one space higher.

see variation];B[pn]C[Good. Very positive.];W[pm];B[on]
(;W[ql]LB[ro:A][qq:B]C[I don't see R8 a lot. White usually plays R5. Is R8 bad?

R8 is bad no doubt. White cannot continue with the usual joseki - see variations - therefore he has to experiment - try to get sente to invade the bottom.]
;B[qo]C[I was happy to play R5.

Naturall move...];W[rn]C[Looking at these two groups it is obvious black stones are doing better.]

(;B[ro]LB[jp:A]C[I thought about not answering S6. Is S5 a must?

S5 is very slow. A would be much better.
see variation.];W[nq]C[ I felt ok for allowing O3. The question is, should I shut it out by P3, or should I pincer O3 from around M3? Or any other choice?

Pincer is the only choice.];B[lq]C[I chose to pincer.

Good.];W[no];B[iq]LB[lo:A][mn:B][nm:C]C[Is J3 too loose? Should I have played around M6, or even P7?

Black A, white B, black C is the only sequence i think.
J3 is very submisive.];W[gq]LB[iq:A]C[ Apparently, my opponent doesn't seem to be patient. Or, is this the right time to invade at G3?   Bad mistake. Consider the tewari - If black didn't have the stone at A - would white play 18 and enable black to make the extension at A? Jet this is exactly what happened.
White is trying to confuse black.

White 18 shouldn't happen in 8k level on igs.];B[io]C[I didn't feel bad because I could enjoy two weak White groups at this point.

Black is doing great - textbook moves.];W[go];B[mm]C[ I was not trying to capture White's O3 group. N7 was only for a threat. But I left my corner open for intrustion as well as possible base for White. Should I have shut the door at P3 or P2?   No. This is very good!]
;W[pr]LB[kp:A]C[ Now White was seeking some room for eyes.

White is in trouble. White should play lightly - maybe A.];B[qr]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[op]C[When confined like this one should play lightly and not settling the shape like this.]

(;B[mr]LB[mp:A]C[There is your mistake - you should have played A.

see variation];W[mp]C[Vital point.];B[nr]C[ O2 is allowing White group's escape. But I thought it is better to force the White group to travel with only one eye. Also, I was worried that my lower right corner might not be iron-clad secure as the game evolves. I could play P2 anytime now.   Well black misses his chance. Things will become difficult for black now. I think this is probably the best you can do now.]
;W[ln];B[im]C[Good.];W[lp];B[kp]C[L3 would be better.];W[ko]
;B[jp]TR[gq]C[Is White doing great here? Right White group is safe now, but his left group is facing reinforeced Black wall. Or is it good for White because Black looks to be a little jammed here?

Black is just fine - making teritory while attacking.
This is the result of a very bad move by white - the marked stone.]
;W[mn]
(;B[en]LB[gm:A]C[ I might have been better off with maybe D8 instead of E6, spreading my left side more quickly. What do you think?

Personaly i like black A.

see variation.

Black 37 is bad since it pushes white just where he wants to go. Remember "enemy vital point is my own."]
;W[gm];B[el]
(;W[hn]C[White shouldnt be so concerned about his conection. This is aji keshi.

see variation.];B[in];W[om]LB[gk:A]C[ P7 was somewhat painful. White constructed nice wall here with a lot of potential. But he ignored the threat on the left group. It was as thougth saying "If you can make the play, you win. But, can you?" This is always a difficult situation to handle. What's your opinion on White's decision here?   White made another bad judgment. Jumping at a is vital. Othervise A is an important move though it's value was greatly reduced when white made life with his bottom group. Good move but at a bad time...]

(;B[gk]TR[om]LB[hl:A]C[ Again, I didn't intend to capture them all. I would be happy to get the left side in return for their lives. Should I have played somewhere near E11 instead of G9? And if White escapes by G9, then near D13 to secure the territory? Or, does that strategy look too obvious?

Here again black misses his chance. Instead of punishing white for his overplay - the marked stone - black let's him of the hook.

see var. with black A.];W[hl];B[il]C[This push is questionable. Only helping white.]
;W[hk];B[gj];W[ik];B[kl];W[lm]C[ I won this game, but I was helped by the opponent. Why would White have to play M7? The reason for L8 was to erase White wall's thickness on the right. Should White have captured N7 at this point?   Actually this is a very nice move! This ensures that the white bottom group is connected to the white right side group therefore making an invasion on the right side very difficult. Thick move.]
;B[jk];W[ij]LB[ii:A]C[Strange. A is much better.];B[jj]C[Another questionable push by black - there is nothing to gain here now.]
;W[ii]LB[cf:A]C[Next black should A but white 54 is already reducing the efectivnes of black approach.]

(;B[dg]LB[cf:A]C[ This was difficult. With White group escaping, I had to acquire proper compensation. How could I maximize my left territory? Evidently, D13 didn't seem to be the answer. What's the right move?

Black A. Black 55 has almost no effect on white hoshi stone therefore white doesent have to respond directly.

see var on black A.];W[di]LB[gh:A]C[ Again, my opponent's philosopy is not "Build and let build". Ok, I would be too greedy to expect to get the whole left side. I would settle for about 35~40 moyo. What should I do?   I'd play somwhere around A. White will have problems living on the left, black 55 will be reinforced, white hoshi stone will come under attack and white center group could be in danger.

56 is unresonable and one gets a feeling white relyes heavily on his fighting abilities. There are some examples of such style of play - giving no territory to the opponent even in the professional play but it is unresonable and often leeds to loss. Such moves are suited only for handicap go.]
;B[ch]LB[gh:A]C[ I don't like C12. It is not for capturing the intruder, nor for protecting my territory. What's your suggestion?

As I said black A.];W[fi];B[gi]C[G11 is also questionable. How about C11 instead. White will play D10, but I can live with Black C9. White would probably push through by G11, then I could apply some pressure on White's upper left corner by something like F17. Or is it just my wishful thinking?   This is a good move - keeps white forces separated and under attack.]
;W[ck]LB[fh:A]C[Big mistake. Black should hane at A.]
(;B[dj]LB[ci:A][fh:B]C[ I think I am making a series of mistakes here. Should I have cared more about my C12 group rather than salvage my lower left moyo?

Black's response is wrong. Black should hane at B. If playing on the left side A is the only move.]
;W[ej];B[dk]C[Black is falling into white's trap.];W[ci];B[cj]
;W[bj];B[bk];W[bh];B[aj];W[bi];B[cl]C[ Now suddenly I felt some urgency. I might have 40~50 moyo in cash right now, White's moyo can blow up any time now. What sould my direction be now?

This sequence was extremly good for white - the game is close again.]
;W[cg];B[gg]C[This is correct - letting white seal you in would be bad.]
;W[jh]LB[kh:A][ig:B]C[Very nice - This disposes of black forcing moves at A or B giving white more freedom of action in the center.]
;B[fc]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[Good. Using the aji of black atari at A and connection at B.]
;W[df]C[ I chose F17. But, is White's D14 really necessary? I was thankfull White didn't pincer me from H17.   White made the proper move here, disposing of black aji here. See one move back.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[kc]LB[nc:A][qf:B]C[ I considered my response for White L17 seriously. Since White D14 was a little slow, I am in a good shape now. All I have to do is reduce White's territory on the right side. Then I win. Where do I go now?   I think white played correctly there but his move at 80 is again an overplay - it extends too far. Black should play B. If white pincers jumping into the corner will put white on the spot, therefore white will extend on the upper side making his move at 80 somewhat overconcentrated.  White 80 should be at A making an aproach at B imposible.]

(;B[qg]LB[qf:A]C[ I really need advice at this juncture. Is R13 ok? How about R14 or N17?

This should be at A. If black doesen't feel confident this is o.k. too.

see variation]
(;W[qi]LB[qe:A]C[ Isn't R11 too small? How about defending the corner first?

Correct defending the corner would be better.];B[rd];W[qc];B[rc]
;W[qb];B[rh];W[ri];B[og]C[ Is P13 a mistake? Should I have gone to S14 and live first?   No. p13 is good.]
;W[ne];B[kd]LB[kb:A]C[ I don't like L16 either.   I'd play this at A. Simply gaining strength in the center is bad - Playing at A black woudl gain territory - if however white intercepts by playing one space to the left of A black gets to play this in sente.]
;W[lc];B[jc];W[ld];B[ke];W[fe]C[White seems very confident that his center group will live - on the other hand white is behind so risky plays are naturall.]
;B[gd]LB[rb:A]C[ Is G16 necessary?   I don't see why I'd play A or perhaps first settle the upper-left.]
;W[rf]C[ S14 really hurts.

Yes.];B[qf];W[rg]
(;B[mg]LB[qe:A]C[I'd play A instead of 101.

see variation];W[qe]C[Giving this to white is extremly big. I'd say minimum of 15 pts.

Game becomes extremly close here.];B[li]C[This is good although I'm not sure white can be killed that easy.]
;W[ki]LB[lh:A]C[Aji keshi laying directly at A is more productive.]
;B[lh]C[Good.];W[hg]LB[hh:A]C[Should be at A.]
(;B[gf]LB[hh:A]C[Another missed chance by black. A is the point.

;B[he]LB[fp:A]C[Better one space to the right. Even better at A.
This is a mistake.];W[fm]LB[er:A][he:B]C[The mistake at B shows here. White may play this move for life - even so white A is bigger.]

Yes. With the game so close black cannot aford to make mistakes.

see variation];B[lf];W[md];B[or]C[Excellent move.];W[oq];B[ps]
;W[ji]LB[ba:A][er:B]C[Better at A or B i think.]
(;B[kg]C[Now only endgame left. I thought I could put this game away early, but it turned out to be only 5.5 point win by Black. What do you think is my biggest problem for not being able to blow this game open?   I hope I established yours and the mistakes your opponent made early on. As to the engame I count it started with white 120 as that secured the life of the last group.

O.k. To finish up. Black missed his big chances at 27,43,61 next played a very slow move at 97 and 101 which made the game close again. Final error was 107 which failed to make use of white weak center group. I hope I have demonstrated the big errors in the game... You should work on your fighting abilities as the main errors were in that area. As to White...
White made some serious mistakes at 18,42,60 which were used to some extent by black but which could have been proven fatal. White needs to work on his positional judgment.

In endgame you both had some problems but all in all you both played good. Good game you both...

I hope you find the commentary interesting and helpful.
Let me know...

(;W[jq]LB[gq:A][mq:B]C[This is called wariuchi. White stone can establish a base with A or B - miai. This breaks the black potential at the bottom.

The continuation is a bit difficutlt.]

Black may choose to settle his stones at once.

Note that black shouldn't play this one space closer as this leaves a weakness at o3.

see the 3 other continuations];W[gq]C[This settles the position here.

Note that white stones are safe as black stones are two spaces away at both sides.]
;B[qf]C[Black next aproaches at 4.

This is played in relation to his two stones in lower-right.]

(;B[hq]C[Continuation 2 settling the stones

This time from the other side...];W[mq];B[qm]C[This is the proper move as white approach from this side would be too good.]
;W[pr]C[White plays a kikashi which settles his stone here.]
;B[qq];W[cj]MA[pr]LB[jd:A]C[White gets to play 6 to stop black from making a double wing formation with his shimari or play A to build his own position.

(;B[jc]LB[gc:A][mc:B]C[Continuation 3 returning the invasion.

This is the move i like best - it brakes the conection between the two white stones. I don't like commiting myself to certain territories or continuations and this opens up many possibilities.

A and B are miai for both so white will probably extend or approach on the right side.]
)
(;B[cf]C[Continuation 4 probing the responses

This move entails a plan.];W[fd];B[dj];W[jc]C[If this is the continuation - this helps black choose what to do with the bottom. Since he got a position on the left it is only natural to expand it...]
;B[hq];W[mq];B[qm]C[The point being that the development on the left side dictates the development on the bottom.

this is why the position on the bottom is usualy not settled at once. Were the position on the bottom settled as it is now whit would play differently on the left side - probably make a high pincer.]
)))
(;W[do]LB[eo:A]C[White has the advantage of hoshi in the upper-left so an pincer would be questionable.
Also a joseki starting with A would give white an ideal thickness in connection with his stone.]
;B[co]C[This seems the only move...];W[cn];B[cp];W[dn]LB[dm:A]
C[The difference between 5 and A is somewhat subtle but this enables white to play an extension on the 4th line in addition this gives a better relation between the extension stone and the white stone in upper-left.]
;B[ep]LB[fq:A][pp:B]C[Black 6 gives black a continuation on the bottom - if this was at A the bottom would become small and the black stone at B would decrease in value.
The downside is black looses sente.];W[dj];B[jq];W[qd]LB[od:A]
[ld:B][pp:C]C[So white gets to play in the empty corner.
I'd play 9 as this forces black to approach from the upper side around A, next white can pincer around B and completly develope his hoshi stone.
If 9 was at q16 black would approach from the right side making a double wing formation with his stone at C himself.
Far from the game being over but this position certainly is favourable for white.]
