 pem 7k: Do I get komi? :)
 rett 7k: good luck];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[pe]C[Black plays high shimari, so I  think right side gains
a little importance, a chance to play R10 is welcome for
both sides.];W[ic]C[I'm not sure whether encouraging L17 is good - would w  K17 be better?]
;B[oq];W[po]C[Gives B a chance to tenuki to a good point.  I'd probably play N3 instead.]
;B[qj]C[So now building thickness facing that B  stone is a bit futile.]

(;W[np];B[mq]
(;W[mp]C[According to Ishida M4 is  joseki. The variations look
horrifying though! The general idea comes out much the same,
you get thickness.];B[lq];W[oj];B[ph]C[I think that this exchange is bad for  you. B gets stronger,
and you have no real connection between your wall and P10.
It's hard to see how to make something of your thickness
though.];W[ec]C[Maybe F17 would be better. Then b L17 is less  threatening.]
;B[kc]C[Looks good by b. If you now build thickness on the left  J17 is too
close. If you don't answer your two stones look thin. Tricky!]
(;W[mc]C[A  Spanish Inquisition move. I did not expect that at all.
Seems to me that you don't need to invade here, B is  entitled to his extension. You're going to find it hard
to look after the invasion *and* your two stones.];B[ld];W[me];B[md];W[nd]
;B[od];W[ne];B[nc]C[This looks a poor result. You're left with 3 heavy
stones and a less stable group. B has solified his
territory.];W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[cg];W[cf];B[bf];W[dg];B[ch];W[je]C[You  need this to make sense of your wall, but really you're
over concentrated.];B[le]C[B did need to play this, I think otherwise you  dominate the centre,
though D12 was also good. Now, do you care about your 3 stones? I'd
say that they're unimportant at present.]
(;W[nh];B[dh];W[eh];B[dd]C[I'm pretty  sure B missed a chance here. Pushing into a knight's
move is very often bad.];W[ed];B[ei];W[fh];B[fi]C[This needs to be sente or B  is in trouble.]
;W[cn]C[Excellent! W fights back. I'd have gone to C7, but the  important
thing is the timing. B's wall is now looking silly.];B[gh];W[ff];B[gi]C
[So he  couldn't prove his move was sente. And he's played a gote move again!
B is now very thick in the centre so you need to watch for fights later.

Unusually 2 corners are open, and top left is still unresolved.]
(;W[gq]C[I  saw a pro describe this as a boxer with his hands spread apart.
He invites a punch on the jaw. The 3-3 invasion is a real threat.
Either E3 or K3 appeal to me.];B[iq]C[A crucial point in the game. If we  treat the lower left as white's
then we can estimate the score.   B top R - 45
B L     - 10
B bot   - 10

W top   - 10
W bot L - 20
W right - potential for 20.

So with komi you're 10 points down, but you have sente which is worth 10  points!

Sadly B can invade bottom left so things are a bit worse, but I make it that
effectively you're 1 mistake behind.]
(;W[ql];B[pk]C[This looks like trouble];W[pl];B[ok]C[Now your top group is very vulnerable, but I can't see how to settle
it quickly.

I think you have to treat the lower right as stable and play elsewhere.]
;W[ol]C[Unless this is sente, you don't have time.];B[er]C[A valid invasion point  in this shape.]
;W[dr];B[fq];W[fp];B[gr];W[eq];B[fr];W[hp]C[Should be a solid  connection]
;B[hq]C[B gets territory in sente.];W[gp];B[mk]C[B is right to  attack, not sure this is the best point though.]
;W[nj];B[nk];W[lf];B[ke];W[kf];B[mb];W[if]C[Seems too easy!];B[cl]C[But this is very big. I can't see how  to avoid it though,
you can't tenuki from your weak group.];W[dm];B[dl];W[nq]C[The right area to  play in, but you've got to keep sente.]
;B[nr];W[pr];B[or];W[lp];B[kp];W[ko];B[kq]C[Dare we leave the position as it is? The Q2 stone
can be sacrificed if B plays down here. If you must
reinforce, play P5.]
(;W[op];B[pq];W[qq];B[pp];W[oo];B[ib]C[Now I think the  game is lost.];W
[hb];B[jb];W[hc];B[db];W[eb];B[dc]C[Bad by black, he should  play B7 or S9.]
;W[da];B[ca];W[ea];B[cb];W[bm];B[bl];W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[bk];W[rk];B[rj]
;W[sj];B[qk];W[rl];B[si];W[sk];B[ri];W[nb];B[oc];W[qc]C[INteresting! If you can live then B will be very upset!]
;B[of]C[
  pem 7k: An uninspired game on my part... :-P

But why stop now! Why did B play P14!! Its not sente.
Try to live - then resign ;-)])
(;W[rk];B[rj];W[bm];B[bl];W[em]C[I think  you can probably play like this, get A8 and T10 in sente and
then play C18. B probably must answer E7 otherwise G8 is big for you.];B
[em]))
(;W[pk]C[Your choice of direction looks good to me. But I think you
chose the wrong point. I looked at R9, but that seems not too good
here. So this sholder hit is the best I could find. The idea
is to threaten to take a lot, and so keep sente.];B[qk];W[ql]C[So now B will  probably feel like reducing your "moyo"
and we get a fight - that's good, we need complications
when we're behind.]))
(;W[bg]C[THere's aji here. B's C15 stones are short of liberties.

You can play moves such as C10 to threaten B13. Not just yet
but soon. B should not be allowed C8.]))
(;W[dh];B[ci];W[kg]C[This might  work. You really don't want to let B play D12.]
;B[di]))
(;W[kd];B[ld];W[jd];B[le];W[cf]C[THis feels better to me, you concede what's more or less already
B territory but stablise your group and probably get to develop the  left.]
