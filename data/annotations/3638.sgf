C[Hello reviewer,

I lost this game narrowly, but i cannot see where I made any big mistakes.

Thank you in advance.

P: Hi, I'm Peter (KGS: tartuffe 4k) and I'll review your game.  I'm only a kyu so my advice won't be perfect.  Let me know if you have any more questions.  I will preface my comments with a P.]

;B[op];W[pj];B[qh];W[jd];B[fq]C[is this f3 correct ?

P: f3 is a big point and it works well with the strong stones in the lower right, emphasizing the lower side (on the 3rd line) rather than the center.  It encourages white to build on the left side.  c10 would also be a good big point.  One thing to watch for is the growing white center: almost all of white's stones are on the 4th line while yours are on the 3rd line.]
;W[ip];B[gp];W[lq];B[iq];W[jq]
(;B[hq]C[this seems a little slow now and gote but secures a base, what else could i have done ?]
;W[jp];B[dr]C[P: d3 would be more severe.];W[dn]C[P: White has too many stones on the 4th line.]

(;B[cq]C[P: c3 too small.  Yes, it grabs a corner and some nice territory, but white is in the process of developing a huge moyo.  I would attack from the other side (c8).]
;W[cp];B[ci];W[ck];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[gd]C[P: This definitely should be on the 3rd line.  White shouldn't expect to get much use from yet another stone on the 4th line.]
;B[nq]C[o3 seems a little slow but honte, mybe c17 possible ?
P: o3 is a little slow, I think, but it does lay the groundwork for an attack beginning with m5.  White could respond here with o5 to block black from the center and develop the group on the right side (important, since q10 is on the 4th line).  It seems a little early for c17 because even IF you lived afterwards white would profit greatly from attacking the c14 d14 c11 group.]
;W[lc]C[P: Very big.]
(;B[rj]C[P: You are stronger than white, I think, so why not jump in at s8?]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[ql];B[rl];W[rm];B[nn]C[P: Good, this attacks two white groups and gets the corner group into the center.  A move with multiple meanings is usually very good.]
;W[ln];B[oh];W[qi];B[ri];W[ph];B[pg];W[pi]
(;B[qg]C[P: Wrong side.  P13 is very important.];W[og]
(;B[of]C[i considered o12 but it wouldnt take territory
P: p12 is a cutting stone which gives it some extra value.  Also, consider the position after o12.  White has great difficulty extracting the p13 stone thanks to the surrounding black stones.]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[nh]
(;B[mf]C[P: Why not m14?  The black territory there is very secure.]
;W[mp];B[oo];W[ro];B[rp];W[sn]C[P: Very slow.  White doesn't need to worry about making eyes now!]

(;B[bp]C[P: This move by itself is sente, but it is a gote sequence.  The big double sente plays around are n18, b10, probably e15.  Also, white is waiting for the chance to attack the three stones in the upper left.  Perhaps d9 would be a good place to start (or finish, if you think it will end in gote).]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[bj]C[P: Argh, white gets b10.];B[bi];W[be];B[bf]
;W[ee]C[this white combination on the left is bad for black so mybe black should play round here first?
P: Perhaps black should continue with e14 or f13 to avoid getting boxed in and to prevent white from taking too much of the center.  Black's gote at b3 allowed white to do this.]
;B[mm];W[ef]C[P: Ouch. Now white's center is looking threatening again.]
;B[eg];W[fg]
(;B[eh]C[P: You can press a little harder and take some of the key endgame points.]
;W[fh];B[cj];W[aj]C[This should be a9, of course];B[ai];W[bl]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bd];B[jf]C[P:  This jumps out a little too far.  The only place this stone can go is to n14 while white can interfere and escape to m17 or o12.]
;W[kf]
(;B[lg];W[kg]C[i think this sequence lost me the game, help!
P:  The problem starts with k14.  Put this at l14 and the sequence is not difficult.  Also, m13 is a "thank you" move, forcing white to play l13, which he wants to play anyway.  P]
;B[ld];W[kd];B[le];W[mc];B[ke]C[P: Of course white will block here.  The l15 k15 exchange is bad because it takes away black's liberties. (see the variation on move 104)]

{Game 2: kyomal vs hengxin : W 83.5 B 78.0}

P:  I would say that black and white were fairly evenly matched in this game.  Black did a good job taking territory along the adge and reducing white's center except for a few places.  In particular: not making the key double sente plays, allowing the left side to get too weak, and the sequence around k14.  If any of these three areas were improved the game would have shifted in black's favor.  If you have any questions about this game or the review, or else if you want to play a teaching game feel free to contact me on KGS (user: tartuffe).  Good luck on your future games! -- Peter]
