C[Dear reviewer:
Thanks for your time in to review this game.
I played white and I lose by 5.5.
I think my problem is after fuseki I don't have a clear plan and I don't know what to do, to sure my groups or to invade opponent moyo. So my problem is when to play tenuki.
Well, tell me about this questions.
My strength is about 16k and my opponent 15k.

Thank's.];B[dc];W[dp];B[pd];W[pp];B[ce];W[jc]LB[fc:A]C[This looks a little too passive to me.  I would play A]
;B[hc];W[mc];B[oc];W[qf];B[re];W[of]LB[rf:A]C[I wouldn't leave the bottom open.  A would be my move]
;B[dj];W[pk];B[cn];W[fq]LB[dg:A]C[Too passive.  This doesn't close the corner, and leaves black influence
undiluted.  I think A is the right point to push to limit black's influence]
;B[bp];W[kq]LB[cq:A]C[Must protect the corner at A];B[qq]C[Good choice for black.  Black's play has been really solid up to this point.]

(;B[nq]C[this is a clear overplay.  Black has to protect against
the cut first.  See variation.];W[op];B[mr];W[pr];B[ns];W[qr]
LB[lq:A]C[Big loss for black.  A could keep the group alive,  and if you
don't intend to rescue the group, black's previous move
shouldn't have been made.]
(;B[cq]LB[lq:A]C[This isn't a good move for black.  It's a marginal territorial
gain, but the group cut off on the bottom is very important
to rescue.  Otherwise white's influence in the corner is  huge.  A is the move.]
;W[mo];B[lp];W[kp];B[lo];W[dl];B[mn]LB[bl:A]C[I would play elsewhere here.  It's not important to save the one stone. The
big point is to follow up at A or someplace like it.];W[no]

;B[qg]LB[ph:A][pi:B]C[this looks like an overplay, and an unnecesary one at that.
Black is way ahead and can afford to play conservatively, or
at least less aggressively.  A or B would aim to run into the
center an limit white territory on the side];W[rh];B[pg];W[pf]
LB[oe:A]C[Make a bamboo joint at A for better shape.];B[og]
;W[mf];B[ng];W[nf];B[ge]C[Big mistake, can't leave the group at the right unsupported.]
;W[mg];B[pi];W[qj];B[ik]C[Good move by black];W[mi]LB[is:A]
C[Poor response by white.  White can't trade the
black group for the much larger group at the lower left,
but that is precisely what he is trying to do.  White should
instead connect his groups by playing at A];B[nj]LB[hr:A]C[Similarly, I guess black doesn't see the opportunity to make
a killing.  I don't think black can escape, and even if he could,
capturing all the while at the lower left is worth more.
Playing at A would pretty much seal white's fate.];W[ni];B[mj]

tactically.  Both apparenty misunderstood the status of the white
group at the lower left, and consequently most of the game was
a comedy of errors - each player had several opportunities to
definitively kill or rescue the white group.])
