C[Hello,

My name is Paul and I've reviewed you game. Look at comments and all variations. Some of variations don't have comments but the moves in them should be obvious.

Hi...



This was a game played on KGS. I'm Black, 19k. My opponent is White, 18k. No handi, but komi = 0.5 (Ranked Game)



I thought I was good (at least for someone playing for aprox. 4 months) althought I lost. I believed I could win this game, but someway I made a HUGE mistake and lost. That was costed me the loss of a K.]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[dq];W[pp];B[mq]C[This move is strange. It's a special purpuse move and in so early stage of the game I think that it's not good. It doesn't attack a corner or extends from a side.]
;W[dg]C[Again strange move. It looks to me as a without-meaning move.]
;B[ci]TR[df]SQ[dj]C[You have to know when to play pincer. This isn't good time. White stone is far from the corner. Ever if it was at triangle it can be ignored by Black. Secondly, Black's move is far from lower corner so Black isn't strong enough to use this pincer. Maybe high pincer at squere could be better.]
;W[ch]
(;B[cf];W[df];B[ce];W[de];B[cg];W[di]C[Now White used Black's earlier mistake.]
;B[bh];W[dh]C[Black's position is on the third line  with lots of weak points.]

(;B[ek]TR[cd][bg][bi][cj][dj]C[It is wasted move cause it doesn't make Black's left group stronger. I marked all weaknesses.
When you have weak group you should try to make it stronger.]
;W[bi]LB[bg:b][ai:d][cj:a][dk:c]TR[ek]C[In this position, I played A. I thought to play B, but that would not be good (as if A was... :( ). C and D occurred for me after the game, althought D could be overplay? How could be the best move? Or any better suggestion?

Now it is a little to late to find the best move. See how triangle stone was wasted. It doesn't make any input to the situation on the left side.]

(;B[cj];W[bg];B[bf];W[ah]C[Now Black have two weak group which will need care later.]

(;B[dn]C[This leaves two serious problem for Black to deal with later.]
;W[qf];B[mc];W[qn];B[gc];W[jc];B[jb]LB[ja:e][id:d][jd:a][kd:c]
[je:b]TR[gc][jc][mc]SQ[pd][de][df][dg][ch][dh][di]C[This was a try to pincer the marked stone and to block W from connect the squared groups. I thought to play all from A to E as alternative moves. Which one could be better?

This move can be used to try to connect Black's two triangle stones. But in this situation, two trinagle stones are too far from white stone. So this can't be successful.]

;W[ld];B[ed];W[ee];B[fc]TR[jp]C[This connection was hastily played?

It's wasted move. You should play in the bigest area eg. triangled spot.]
;W[gd];B[hd]LB[jd:b][ge:a]C[This move was bad. now I know. I thought to play A, but that could be a lost move. B also was a idea. Suggestions?

My suggestion is leave this area. Nothing more can be done to it. On the goban there are much bigger move to play.]

(;B[kj]LB[jh:a][kh:d][ji:b][li:c][gj:e]C[Tought to press on A or B, descend on C or go to D to make some protection. E also ocurred to me as a way to isolate W. That was good ideas? And could be better moves than the played?]

A is not urgent move. White cannot play there. It would put her in atari as in the game. Ever if White could play there a triangle stone is securing the a-b cut.]

Thanks a lot for the analysis

You can't do anything on the right, as long as White doesn't make a mistake. But even if you managed to live it is very doubtful if you can get enough point to win because White is leading by about 60 point.

Overall, I think you've played good game and made one mistake which lost this game. Try to play more solidly and play moes which don't have future.]
