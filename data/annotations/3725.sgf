C[Thank you for reviewing my game. I was black and lost by 44 points although I didn't see the really "big" mistakes I've made.]

(;B[jd]C[This move appeared natural to me: White didn't bother to make a base so I'm trying to profit by attacking from behind.

The idea sounds good. You can consider the alternatives i give too.]

yes, i'd have preferred that myself.];W[kc];B[jc];W[hc]

Q17 first looks to be correct sequence.];W[jb];B[ib];W[kb];B[ic]
;W[hb];B[ia]C[B should have played elsewhere. This move seperates the two W groups, but they are both relatively strong and in no danger.]
;W[ng]MA[ke]C[After this move i felt that i already fell behind. White has built some quite big territory in the top left corner and the O13 group I wanted to attack seems to be out of danger.

Yes, W's in no danger as W has a good shape at the top, and the peep of L15 in reserve.]
;B[ph];W[rh]C[an unusual move i've never seen before, i must admit.]

(;B[qg]C[I didn't really know how to answer this invasion. Should I have pressed with R11 instead of defending the corner?

The correct answer. It was in the follow up where you erred.]

C[Not sure what to do at this stage. Maybe trying to attack with L16 or the shimari F3 would have been better!?

I think attacking would be a more active plan, which would be preferable since B appears to be behind. B probably won't be able to kill, but he should be able to get central thickness and can use it to his advantage.]
;W[cl];B[cg];W[be]
(;B[bf]C[I'd have kept this move in reserve.];W[ce]C[W could consider tenukiing too since this is rather small for the middlegame.]

There's nothing to be afraid of. see variation.];W[gl]

;W[df]MA[gl][hm][ho][hq]C[slow move . He should do something abt his marked stones.]
;B[dg]C[you can tenuki instead of replying.];W[eg];B[eh];W[fg]
;B[jh]C[Trying to gain space for the J19 group. Again I think playing L16 followed by P18 first would have been better.

Yes. you must unsettle the W group so that u can attack both the top and bottom groups. With your thickness you could possibly kill the lower group.]

At this point B seems to be too far behind. This is the last comment.
  The key mistakes in the game include move 29, 35 and 57. You should also strive to always think of tenuki during the game, and not be afraid of invading the opponent if he's weaker, and do no waste moves attacking a strong group. Save the opportunity for later, and grap it when it comes. Feel free to email me any questions you may have, i may not be able to give you the correct answer, but i'd try my best.]
