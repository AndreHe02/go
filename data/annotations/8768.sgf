C[Hello Chris,
I am lorl from France (1k on KGS). 
I will try to review your game as best as I can.
Feel free to mail me back if you have some additional remarks ;-)
My comments are followed by : (LL)];B[pp];W[dq];B[dd];W[qc]
;B[co];W[fp]LB[cl:A][cq:B]
(;B[cl]LB[cp:B][jq:A]C[this move is a possible continuation.
(LL)]
(;W[jq]LB[pd:C][qj:A][cq:B]C[this move is a little premature -- see variation.
(LL)]
(;B[qj]C[At move 9, I considered approaching the top-right corner, but as I did no know any josekis for a 3-3 approach, I chosen to play on the most open side.
(Chris)

this move is perfectly playable, but it would be interesting for black to play at C3 first...
(LL)];W[fc];B[cf];W[db];B[cc];W[ic]LB[di:A][cq:B]
(;B[di]C[With so many plays on the left-side, I felt a defensive move to build a fairly solid territory on that side was the best option.
(Chris)

this move is not bad ; but a play at C3 is still a better option to reinforce the left side in 'sente'.
(LL)];W[od]LB[qg:B][nq:A]TR[qj]C[this white move is quite big... moreover it reduces the power of black "triangle" stone.
(LL)]
(;B[nq]SQ[qg][pm][qm][qn][qp][pq]C[At this point, I considered a number of options for securing the sides. I choose to go with my move figuring it would force and invasion which would allow me to fully secure other territory.
(Chris)

I ike R13 -- see my comment in variation
(LL)];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[oo];W[or]
;B[nr];W[ps];B[qg]SQ[ld]C[I felt further securing the right side which limiting the top-right corner was the best option at this point. It works well at forming territory with the invasion in the bottom-right complete now.
Another option I considered at this point is attempting an invasion near the marked point, however it felt too tight to benefit me at this stage.
(Chris)

your move is very good : it completes an interesting framework on the right side, and also aims at a future invasion on the top.
(LL)];W[og];B[ko]C[Move 31 felt good as it both weakens the bottom-left white group while starting to form a framework for some large territory around the bottom-right.
(Chris)

ok
(LL)];W[io]LB[ni:B][km:A]
(;B[km]LB[oj:x][ok:x]C[this move is useful for building a "moyo", but it does not attack white directly...
so it is 'gote', and white has time to reduce black's framework at one of the "x" points.
(LL)];W[mk]LB[oj:x][ok:x]C[In the review with my opponent, he mentioned he felt the framework was too big so he invaded with 34.
(Chris)

yes, but this move does not exert any pressure on black's stones, and is perhaps a little too far from white's position ?
I would prefer a move at one of "x".
(LL)];B[ni]C[To maximize my benefit, I played to try to keep 34 cut off from support, while threating to invade and expand my territory.
(Chris)

this is a very good choice !!
(LL)];W[kk];B[li];W[im];B[jl];W[jk];B[il];W[ji];B[mg]C[43 was to strengthen my stones in sente, using the threat of cutting the white stone to the right off.
(Chris)

yes
(LL)];C[at my opinion, the overall position at this time seems quite equal, but I really like black.
(LL)]PL[B];W[ne]LB[kg:B][pi:A]
(;B[pi]C[At this point, I felt I needed to defend against my stones getting cut off.
(Chris)

this move is far too slow and very passive...

[ob][pb][jc][kc][lc][mc][nc][ld][md][nd]C[After 46, I felt that there was not much benefit in trying to cut the white stones. They will likely either connect or live. As such, I decided to defend my territory.
(Chris)

I not agree, this move is again very passive...
look at the prospective territories for black and white, and you will see that white's is bigger than black's one. so black has no interest to defend here.
(LL)];W[lf]C[white has not only connected his stones, has has lock all the territory at the top !
now, the game begins to be good for white.
(LL)];B[fe];W[ig]LB[fh:A][cq:B]
(;B[fh]C[this move is quite small...
(LL)];W[cp];B[do];W[fn]LB[el:A][kq:B]C[In the review, I realized 55 was slow, and I should have defended the territory on the right, as with the variation.
(Chris)]
