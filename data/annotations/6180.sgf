C[Apacuka [11k?\]: hi];B[qd]C[Neikron [11k\]: Hi];W[dd]C[Neikron [11k\]: Good luck]
;B[pp]C[Apacuka [11k?\]: have a god game];W[dq]C[Neikron [11k\]: You too]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[ge]C[this looks a little strange, and it's never played
in expert games, but I can't say why not.  The
usual move is F15];W[lc];B[nc];W[qn];B[ql];W[qj];B[pl]C[Neikron [11k\]: Right here, I thought that I could limit white on the side, going either up, blocking in his R10 stone, or down towards R6, gaining influence in the bottom right.]
;W[qf];B[pe]C[Up to this point the play seems pretty conventional,
if not quite textbook.  P15 seems small, or perhaps
premature, where there is a corner and two sides
largely uncontested.];W[ck]C[white is trying to stretch to cover the entire
side, but actually both above and below are
open.  A hopeful overplay, but not really
terrible.];B[dn]C[Play low, C6 or C5.];W[bn];B[co]C[I'm not sure about his one.  If you want to 
contest the corner from this position,  C4 
looks more promising.  But the shape is
already wrong.   The best move might be
to abandon D6 now, and hope ot use it
later.];W[bp];B[cc]C[Neikron [11k\]: I played here, because I thought I'd have an advantage fighting for this corner, with the backup of F17 and G15, enclosing the corner, or gaining influence to the middle, perhaps connecting to the right side, depending on where white played next.

At this stage of the game, you need to predict
what the overall shape will become. While will
play D17 which separates you into two weak groups.
The corner group will be small, but live.  The top
group will scramble but eventually connect toward
the center and survive, but in the process white's
top group will easily become safe.  White's side
group will become substantial territory.  

That may not be what actually occurs, but that's
the story I would tell myself.  It doesn't sound
good, so I would look for a different move.
D18 looks good locally, but the more pressing
problem is what to do abou the stones at the lower
left.    They're likely to become the center of a really
big white territory.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[de];W[cb];B[be];W[bc]
;B[cf];W[bd];B[ce];W[bh];B[dh];W[eb];B[ed];W[fb];B[fp]C[Neikron [11k\]: This move I thought seemed ok at first, by shape, but it didn't seem to do as much as I had thought. Maybe something securing Q4 would have been better..?

Situations like this, It's best to avoid building out
from a weak group.  You end up with a lumpy mess
and no territory, while white makes bank.];W[nq];B[lq];W[jq]

;B[no];W[po];B[qp];W[pr];B[rr];W[qq];B[rq];W[qo];B[or];W[oq]
;B[ro];W[rn];B[rp];W[so]C[White S5 is unnecessary and risky.  What
happens if black ignores it and plays S8?
I'm not sure, but white has two weak groups
surrounding a corner group with an eye.
Not the fight I would choose.

White should take S8, which is the intended
line.  Maybe white was hoping black was asleep?];B[pq];W[rl]
C[Neikron [11k\]: Should I have maybe narrowed in to kill the S6 group without letting him out, or was my previous move at Q3 necessary to secure that area?]

[im:B]C[Neikron [11k\]: Here, I was trying to block white from going further, but it didn't seem to work as well as I'd hoped. My other choice for this move was somewhere around E9, to trap in the left side. But I feel as if I have wasted some moves before this, and should have done a better job of securing both sides of white.

At this point, black's only hope is to make
a large territory in the center, but the best opportunity
is around A, not B.  Consequently, N11would be
better.];W[ph]C[This is the wrong continuation for white.  The
stage is set to dispute the center - there is nothing
substantial to be gained or lost here, but the
player to take n11 makes a big gain.  If white
loses sente he could lose the game.];B[pg];W[pi];B[qg];W[ml]
C[Same here. It's a big threat, but it will be answered.
Unless white can predict a major breakthrough, this
should be left for later.   The situation could be
different if white's group were at risk and needed
to be extended in order to live.];B[ll];W[mn];B[lm];W[ln];B[kn]
;W[nr]C[wishful thinking.  If black plays M2 there is 
no way white can live.];B[lo];W[lr];B[on];W[pn];B[qr];W[pk]
;B[kr];W[kq];B[mr];W[jr];B[ls];W[gk];B[ek];W[hm]C[Neikron [11k\]: White sneaks in, and I think I played E9 too late, but was there a better way to secure white?]
