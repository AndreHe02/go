AB[dd][pd][dp]C[[kb\]: Hello - since this game is a handicap game, I will only comment on a White "overplay" if it is egregious.

General comments: I think you need to be more decisive and strategic in your moves.  You have made a lot of slack plays.  This game didn't come down to a lot of tactical errors, but mostly direction of play mistakes.  In your future games, try your best to find the right strategic move at all times (urgent before big, as always).]
;W[qp];B[oq];W[kq];B[hq];W[pq];B[op]C[Thought about playing lighter here maybe at K16, this shape is a bit awkward.

[kb\]: If you don't like this shape, then your play at H3 was wrong.  Actually, White's exchange hurt L4, so you should look to capitalize on that.]
;W[pn]
(;B[lo]C[My natural instinct is to play at N4 here, but went for a lighter move.

[kb\]: There is no reason to play light here.  Your two stones are not heavy, but strong!  You should use a leaning attack.  See variation.]
;W[jp];B[lm]C[[kb\]: This move is almost useless because Black is running away on dame points.  Tenuki is better than the move you played.]
;W[mq]C[[kb\]: A vital point.];B[on]C[[kb\]: This is the obvious move you had been wanting to avoid with your plays at M5 and M7, but now you are forced to play it anyway to defend against a flexible White shape.  If you had played it much earlier, you would have had the initiative!]
;W[pm]
(;B[qk]C[O8 was my gut reaction, but didn't like the shape. Perhaps it would've been better to play a bit farther away, maybe at R10 or even R13?

[kb\]: No, you should not be playing on the right side at all.  It is the wrong direction.  You need to use your strength to bully the three White stones at the bottom.  See variation.]
;W[om];B[nn];W[ok]C[[kb\]: Now an attack against the White stones would be even better!]
;B[pi]C[[kb\]: Looks like a good move, but it is clearly the wrong direction.]
;W[io]C[[kb\]: White gets the vital point first.];B[nj]C[F4 was the first move I considered, thought that was a bit too passive. Maybe this plan is too naive though? I like the shape of all my groups so perhaps the solid move is best here.

[kb\]: What is this move doing, exactly?];W[pk];B[lk]C[[kb\]: Again, a dame play, but at least this one tries to enclose White.  However the price is way too high.  R10 is huge.]
;W[oi];B[qj]C[[kb\]: Good.];W[oh]C[[kb\]: White overplayed, here's where you take advantage.]

(;B[pg]C[[kb\]: This is a "looks good" but poor move that allows White to connect.]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[li]C[[kb\]: Good move by White.];B[ki];W[kh]
;B[kj];W[jh];B[ii];W[ji];B[jj];W[ij]TR[io][jp][kq]SQ[op][oq]
[nn][lo][lm][on][lk][kj][jj][ki]C[[kb\]: I hope by now you can see that the game has *actually* been about the two marked groups the entire time.  White's cut asserts this fact.]
;B[lh];W[lg];B[mh];W[mg];B[mi];W[qg]C[A mistake from white?

[kb\]: Yes, looks like aji keshi.];B[pf];W[rh];B[qi];W[qf];B[qe]

;B[rd]C[The exchange seems great for black.

[kb\]: You let White get the corner in gote when it was yours before, and all the territory on the right was yours already.  I don't think so.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[Better to play at K17?];W[md];B[id]C[[kb\]: Another vague move without thought to shape or direction.]
;W[gc];B[gd]C[[kb\]: You're touching a weaker stone, a basic kyu-level mistake.]
;W[fd];B[ge];W[fe];B[ff];W[ef];B[ee];W[fc];B[df];W[eg];B[dg]
;W[hc];B[eh];W[hd];B[gf];W[he];B[hf];W[if];B[ig];W[jf]C[[kb\]: Not a bad result for you for a handicap game, though to let White get a huge amount of points this soon is dangerous.]

(;B[db]C[[kb\]: Large endgame.  Wrong direction.

Look at the board again.  Do you see any White stones that could be attacked to make profit?

...Yes, the same group we have been talking about.];W[cn];B[cl]
;W[en];B[fp];W[dk]
(;B[co]C[The result of the classic joseki starting from D8 here I think would be good for black as well. Maybe this move was a bit too greedy.

[kb\]: It's time to forget joseki and attack something!  You are strong all around.  Joseki gives an equal result, a losing proposition for you.
