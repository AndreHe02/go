C[Thanks for reviewing my game. ( 20-22K IGS)
kk1: 17-Oct-2004 review by Keith Kim, kk1 [12k\] on KGS];B[qd]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[oc];W[dj];B[qo]C[Are black's corners safe? Should I not have allowed him to do this?
kk1: Yes, both Bs corners are safe which gives him nothing to worry about and free to play and fight anywhere. If you're comfortable playing close in the beginning, it would have been good for you to prevent this. Otherwise, it is also good if you make similar gains. E17 is good for this; D4 is okay since it can play to either side. Next most important is to not let him play Q10 as it can tie into the strength of either or both corners.]
;W[hq];B[bp];W[cq]C[kk1: an unusual move by B, good response by W]
;B[bq];W[bn]C[kk1: better to not let B escape through C5. Keeping him running along the second line by playing C5 is much better for W.]
;B[co];W[bo];B[cp];W[dm]C[trying to make him run to the centre while I develop thickness and space on the side... but I think I should have plaed d3 first
kk1: yes, play D3 first, then C7 would've been better than D7 as it is better connected and needs less defending.]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[dq];W[eq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]C[kk1: weakness at E4 allows the safe B group to expand into centre. you should try to cap it and minimize its effect for the rest of the game.]
;W[jd]C[kk1: while it's good to play in open areas, try to make some safe 'bases' that you can build upon.]
;B[fc]C[kk1: this is a good move by B showing the difficulty with W playing K16. now both need support. protecting the corner guarantees territory and a base to work with. K16 still has options. Remember proverb about losing all four corners.]
;W[hc]C[I thought it was important not to give away influence here on the side given the current board position, that's why I played h17 instead of d17]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[cb];B[bc];W[eb];B[dd];W[ec];B[ed];W[fd]
;B[ce];W[bd];B[ad];W[de]
(;B[ee]C[kk1: here B chose [or maybe an oversight\] to expand two important stones instead of just capturing at B15. see variation]
;W[be];B[cf];W[bb];B[bf];W[ac];B[df];W[ch]C[I abandoned my plan for the upper side with this move because I thought it would be easy territory.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[ff];W[fb];B[ge]C[kk1: this worked out well for B, which is now safe and can continue to expand. Ws corner is of territory value only.]
;W[gc];B[hd];W[jj]C[I think this move gives me flexibility.
kk1: yes possibly, but it is clearly more important to play R10 now before B does. as a general rule, play to ensure some corner territory, then sides, then elsewhere, in that order.]
;B[jg]C[kk1: a good move to eliminate some of Ws options. B would do better to play Q10 however.]
;W[qj]C[kk1: ah, finally someone plays the big move. after this is settled, next biggest area is bottom edge.]
;B[oj];W[qm];B[jq]C[kk1: the following sequence is well played by both sides]
;W[lq];B[jo];W[ho]C[Is H5 or M5 better here?];B[il];W[lo];B[km]
;W[po];B[pp];W[pn];B[qn];W[pl];B[rm];W[rl];B[rn];W[op];B[oq]
;W[pg];B[om]C[kk1: here it is very important to connect. not doing so means that each of W's groups requires much support to maintain viability.]
;W[no];B[nm];W[mc];B[nb];W[nc];B[mb];W[lb];B[od];W[bh];B[jr]
;W[hr];B[ms];W[mr];B[ks];W[ns];B[ls];W[nr];B[nq];W[mp];B[pm]
C[kk1: this is very bad for W];W[ql];B[nn];W[qp];B[rp];W[qq]
;B[qr];W[jp];B[kp];W[ip];B[mq];W[kq]
(;B[lr]C[kk1: here B makes an honest mistake of just keeping groups disconnected, rather than safely surrounding the groups collectively by playing L5 instead. see variation]
;W[ko]C[kk1: W fortunately gets to connect to left, after missing connection on right side.]
;B[or];W[jn];B[oo];W[jm];B[jl];W[kl];B[kk];W[ll];B[lm];W[mk]
;B[lk];W[ml];B[mm];W[mj];B[jk];W[ng];B[of];W[og];B[pf];W[gj]
C[kk1: better to close off B's lower left corner to make territory up from bottom edge.]
;B[ij];W[hk];B[ik]C[I felt the whole game depended on how I handled black's poor shape in the centre. I though a fight for this group would win me huge space on the left side. Is there any way I could have killed this group?]
;W[hh]C[preventing connection to the corner];B[ii];W[ih];B[jh]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[if];B[jf];W[ie];B[ig];W[hg]C[preventing connection, but allowing an eye at k10.]
;B[li];W[mi];B[kj];W[lh];B[kh];W[lj];B[lg];W[le];B[mh];W[nh]
;B[mg];W[gm]C[kk1: a good move, close off one side. more important to close off the corner first though.]
;B[hl];W[gl];B[ei];W[di];B[eh];W[ej];B[dh];W[id];B[ol];W[ok]
;B[nk];W[pk];B[ni]C[kk1: good for B. watch those cutting points. always think of how each of your groups will be ensured of connecting to or making life]
;W[oi];B[nj];W[pj];B[nl];W[qf];B[qe];W[rf];B[nf];W[sd]C[kk1: here W could jump to T17 if RS14 is safe, look up 'monkey jump']
;B[pi];W[qi];B[ph];W[qh];B[me];W[pb];B[ob];W[qc];B[qa];W[qb]
;B[rd];W[se];B[rc];W[sc];B[rb];W[eo]C[kk1: yes, now B can't cause damage]
;B[dn];W[en];B[do];W[ep];B[ao];W[bm];B[es];W[fs];B[ds];W[an]
;B[ap];W[np];B[ir];W[hs];B[os];W[md];B[nd];W[lc];B[lf];W[ke]
;B[kf];W[la];B[ma];W[fi];B[fh];W[gh];B[gg]C[kk1: capturing at P12 is unnecessary, as if B captures at P12, W recaptures at P12 with snapback]
;W[oh]C[silly];B[in];W[io];B[im];W[ag];B[af];W[sl];B[sm];W[hf]
;B[gf];W[cg];B[bg];W[ah];B[ae];W[fd];B[dg];W[bj];B[fe];W[is]
;B[js];W[fc]C[gave away the initiative with a small move];B[kn]
;W[jo];B[hi];W[gi];B[hj];W[gk];B[kr];W[lp];B[hn];W[gn];B[je]
;W[kc];B[sb];W[re];B[ln];W[on];B[oo]C[kk1: another snapback situation, this time for B]
;W[iq]C[kk1: a close game played well by both sides, although some big moves were overlooked by both sides for many turns. Often W was able to pick up on these first, like the middle right side and capping the bottom left corner. B played quite solidly which made up for missing some of the big moves first. There were likely several places in the endgame which could have swayed the game by several ponits--enough to change the outcome--for instance if W didn't capture the stones in snapback, it would have had 1 more point to tie. Changing the order of play of the ending probably had other opportunities for 1 point differences.
Advise for W: try to make your moves part of a more definite plan--medium term gains rather than long term prospecting. Also do not leave quite as many weaknesses for as long. Also make some safe bases from which you can expand without requiring maintenance moves.
Advice for B: expand your safe bases and use them to push into open areas of play. Try to pick up on big moves in different areas of play sooner than your opponent.]
)
(;B[ko];W[ln];B[lm];W[lr];B[lp]C[kk1: only way B might lose now is if he fails to see that letting top and bottom W groups connect gives it more liberties than Bs lower group.]
;W[js];B[is];W[kr];B[js]C[kk1: now W has fewer liberties and loses the capturing race.]
))
(;B[be];W[ee];B[cd];W[fe]C[kk1: here B gains corner territory but can't expand into centre. B can still get territory down side.]
