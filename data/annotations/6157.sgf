C[shinsei: hi
davidn2: hi

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt, 2 dan at the local club.  I hope I can give you some ideas about where to play, but since you won this game by a large margin, it may not be the best candidate for review.]
;B[pd]C[If you find any mistakes that I didn't comment on, please point them out :)]
;W[qp];B[ep];W[dd];B[op];W[cp]C[This move is just a personal preference. Anything wrong about it?

crux: Black's stones are working together nicely and he has sente.  But I'm sure it's playable.]
;B[dm];W[eo]C[crux: This move doesn't occur in my GoGoD database.  Black's previous move is unusual enough that there probably aren't any fixed sequences.]
;B[fo];W[en];B[fn];W[cn]LB[em:A]C[crux: In this shape I want to push through at A instead.]
;B[em];W[cm];B[dp];W[cq];B[dn]C[I liked this exchange. To me Black 17 doesn't seem that useful, especially as it's gote. It's true that he gets influence but I thought that I could erase this advantage with the next move.

Any alternative sequences?];W[lp]LB[oq:A]C[With this move I tried to erase the option of black making a big moyo at the bottom.

A seems wrong as it leaves white in a flat position which would help black to use his influence.

Is there a better move?];B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[no];W[ln]
LB[iq:A]C[I was not quite sure if playing A here is correct. I deciced to run towards the center but maybe that's too passive.

crux: This is probably good since a move around A isn't interesting for either side - the game move is on the weaker side.]
;B[jq]MA[cp][cq]LB[ln:A][lp:B]C[Black 25 clearly aims to make territory at the bottom. I thought I would be alright as i still have the two marked stones to reduce blacks area. Solidifying the stones A and B seemed more important.

crux: Black's move is wrong on many levels.  He's playing from the strong side, his stone is overconcentrated with his thickness on the left, and whatever territory he tries to make has a hole at the bottom.  Then again, allowing White to make a base easily would be bad too, so it's hard to see where he should play.]
;W[jp];B[ip]
(;W[jo];B[kq]C[I didn't see how this move is a threat in any way, so tenuki.

crux: It threatens to link up with the eyeless group on the right, so tenuki is not an option IMO.  Once Black links up, your stones lose all their purpose.  I'm pretty sure White's previous move should have been here.]
;W[nc];B[lq]C[crux: Now your group has no purpose anymore, and no eyes either.  This is a terrible result.]
;W[er]C[crux: Way too small.  The corners on the right are much more urgent.  You're playing near your own and near Black's strength.]
;B[qg];W[pb]LB[jd:A][qc:B]C[my alternative thought was White A. But this would have left a weakness and the possibility for black to secure a big corner. Going for the corner myself by playing B doesn't look ok either as black could build outside influence and attack the top left stone. Right decision?

crux: About the large corner - it's usually impossible to prevent the opponent from getting anything at all.  The game move looks normal, but A is also a fairly standard setup.]
;B[qc];W[kc];B[cl];W[gq]LB[bl:A]C[A is most probably better (the natural move). Right?

crux: Two things - a), do you need another move in this area to live? and b) the game move is too concerned about denying Black territory.]
;B[bl];W[co];B[do];W[cf];B[dr];W[dq];B[fr];W[eq];B[fq];W[iq]
C[crux: It might be better to omit this in order to leave aji around here to help the central group later on.]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[go];W[gr];B[fp];W[fs]C[Too small?

crux: Only if Black doesn't answer, I guess.];B[hq];W[mp];B[mq]
;W[qi]LB[ln:B][qi:A][ro:C]C[crux: Looks overextended.  I don't think you'll get to keep all three groups (A, B, C) against a strong opponent.]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[mo];W[kl]LB[ec:B][ql:A]C[Sacrificing 2 stones while making light shape seemed ok. Is there a better move?

crux: The entire group is pretty much worthless to White, since you allowed Black to connect underneath earlier.  So, play in a way as to not put emphasis on it.  Maybe A or B.]
;B[lo]C[crux: Black is too concerned with capturing tiny clumps of stones.]
;W[ql];B[ch]C[crux: Overconcentrated again, should probably invade the top.]
;W[dh]LB[ec:A][nl:B]C[crux: I think I'd prefer A or B.];B[di]
;W[dg];B[ei];W[ec]LB[hd:A][ke:B][nl:C]C[this seemed just too big to not secure it.

Maybe from a whole-board view A or B are better?

crux: The game move is more solid.  Very little aji to exploit for Black.  You can't turn the entire upper side into territory with one move, so make it hard for Black's invasion to live.
I'd like to point out something like C as another pretty big move - after that, it should be hard for Black to make a lot of profit from White's weak group.]
;B[ic];W[ke]LB[ie:B][je:A]C[crux: This is lenient.  A knight's move at A, or possibly even a cap at B, would put more pressure on Black.]
;B[ie];W[gg]C[crux: Vague move, extending from strong stones, does not make Black uncomfortable in any way.]

;B[pf];W[hc]C[this seemed like the move that would grant white's victory. The only worrysome stones left are the ones in the center. Should I have taken care of them first?

crux: If you're confident that you can make them live, why not stake the game on it?  I'd probably feel nervous as they are rather weak, and it could become a large-scale capture.  Black can lean on White's position in the bottom right.]
