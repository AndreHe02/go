;B[dj];W[cl]C[That is too early. The thickness black can gain by attacking this stone is too good for him in the opening. Later, when everyting is a little more setteled, thickness is not so valuable.]
;B[dl];W[dm];B[cm];W[dk];B[el];W[cj];B[ek]LB[di:A]C[A is more important for black. You could be happy. that he lets you out there, so easylie.]
;W[ck];B[en];W[di];B[jp]TR[fp][dp][cq]C[But nervertheless. Now you can see, how the thickness helps him atacking the marked stones.]
;W[hq];B[ho];W[nq]TR[cq][dp][fp][hq]LB[qn:A]C[Be carefull. If black runs a splitting attack between this stone and the marked group, you have two weak groups to look after and black has none. Normaly it is not a good advice to play where your opponent is strong. He gains more from attacking you, than you could harm his strong position.
If you play someting around A, you could settle this group easily or, if he pincers, invade the corner in sente.
The territory at the edge is not so big, espacially with your stone at H3.]
;B[pn];W[kq];B[lp]LB[jq:A]C[Yor are lucky. Your opponent missed the splitting move at A.]
;W[lq]LB[jq:A][oc:B]TR[nq]C[play A here, and you have no longer to worry about this group. If black want to cut of the marked stone in gote, feel happy and take the initiative somewhere else. There are a lot of big moves left, as B for example.]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[pq];W[np]C[With this move, you are strengthening black, for gaining nearly nothing. I think you know meanwhile, that I will recommend the connection of the two groups. "Go is a game of cutting and connecting" says a proverb. The more groups you have to look after, the more targets has your opponent to attack and, of course, this holds vice versa, too. Ask yourself if you can hold both groups, if black cuts them appart.]

(;B[no]LB[kp:A]C[Again you take profit from a questionable black move. This answer take no respect of the cut at A, and you exploit it quite well, with the next moves. It is hard to find a good answer for black. I would try the variation.]
;W[kp];B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[oc]LB[jd:A][pe:B]TR[qd]C[Your connection is not established yet, but I think you can`t afford to waste a move there now. If black plays, for example, something around A, he would take the lead and it would be not easy for you to cath up. So tenuki might be ok at this point. But If he cuts, it would be a hard fight for you. You must be aware of it.
It is hard to say, if the actual move, or something around A is better. If he pincers you, by playing around  A himself, he has a good target to attack. On the other hand, is blacks marked stone on the 3-4 point, so an influence orientated play, like a pincer, cannot realy be recommended in this corner. You can build up a nice wall, starting with B, for example.]
;B[pb];W[pc]LB[lc:A][ob:B][nc:C][ne:D]TR[oc]C["Don`t push in a keima", another proverb. You are strengthening black again for gaining nearly nothing. Make a base for your own stone with A. If he plays B, let him crawl along the second line and play C patently. If he plays, where you have played, you can choose for example D. If he wants to capture the marked stone after that, let him do so in gote.]
;B[qc];W[ob]TR[pb]LB[oe:A][lc:B]C[*Much* to small. Do you really want to capture the marked stone in gote at this stage of the game? What if black plays A now, mapping out a large moyo, or attacking with B? Establish your own stones with B and don`t fear, that black could crawl along the second line. You would see it with pleasure.]
;B[qb]C[You are lucky, that he responds as you have intended, I think.]
;W[lc]LB[kc:A]TR[ob][oc]C[Finally! but now you have the two marked stones allready in place, you can think about extending to A.]
;B[fc];W[ce]TR[lc]LB[ic:A]C[I would pincer at A. This is an ideal extension from your marked stone and black is left with no good attack  to your stone in the corner. If he invades your sphere of influence on the left side, be happy to have two lonley stones to attack.]
;B[ic]C[Now he got the extension for himself.];W[ql]LB[qj:A][qi:B][qf:C]
[ql:D]C[If black answeres with something around A, this stone is very lost. Play B here. Black can attack this stone only from one side and you can establish it by playing to the other side, either C or D. This gives black a good extension, but he is strong there, you cannot expect too much for you.]
;B[ol];W[qi]C[Good!];B[pg];W[kn];B[ll];W[oo];B[op];W[nn];B[on];W[mo];B[nm]
C[Your lucky day! :-) You tricked your opponent good with this sequence.]
;W[lm];B[mm];W[mn];B[lj];W[oh]LB[pj:A]TR[pg]C[Overplay. You cannot extend effectivley there in the middle, because of the weak point of A and the marked stone. Now it is time to count territory:
White:
35  UL
30  Lo
15  UR + Ri
5 prisoners = 85 points

Black:
15 LR
10 UR
5 Up
5 LL
X middle = 35 + X points

That means, black must get 40 points in the middle. That would be a hard work. There is no need for you, to make overplays. Try to reduce the middle a little and establish your own position. In other words: start the endgame.]
;B[oe];W[nd];B[pj]LB[ph:A][pi:B][oi:C]C[Black should start with A here. if you play B, the he cuts at C. If you push the cutting stone to the left, he should not be really unhappy.]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[ph];B[qg];W[qh];B[nj];W[ni]LB[mh:A][ee:B][ej:C][rn:D]C[Why not simply a? There is locally no need to give you opponent extra strength by touching him. But moves like B or C are much bigger. Black cannot make much territory in the area you played. If you fear for the life of your group, the make eyespace with D.]
;B[mi];W[nh];B[pk];W[qk]LB[rl:A]C[A would make better eyespace.];B[rm];W
[qm]C[I think there is no way for you, to make two eyes on the edge. So run away immediately.]
;B[qn]LB[rn:A]C[Big mistake. should be at A];W[rl];B[sm];W[sl];B[rn];W[nf]
LB[rh:A][rg:B][rj:C]C[Your moves before this one semmed to look for eyespace at the edge. It is never good to change a plan you have made, unless you see, that it do not work. And your opponent gives you the chance to do so: White A, Black B, C.]
;B[ne];W[me];B[of]LB[mf:A][mg:B]C[Black should cut at A here. Now you can establish the connection with B.]
;W[ng]LB[mg:A][mf:B]C[A is the only move here. Now the cut at B still works.]
;B[km]C[But he did not see it. On the other hand, it might be not so big, because you can make live at ghe edge.]
;W[cg]LB[ef:A]C[What about A? A black invasion on the left side, would be a hard job after that.]
;B[ee]
(;W[rg]LB[bq:A]C[Small and gote. Try the sente variation. A is very big.]
;B[rf];W[rh];B[qe]C[There is no need for this move];W[ej]C[Good. Now you have a foot in the middle.]
;B[eh];W[fj];B[hl];W[fl];B[fk];W[gk];B[gl]C[This move might be the losing one.]
;W[em];B[dn];W[fn];B[cp]
(;W[jm]LB[bq:A]C[There is only A. It would be hard for black, to make live with his group. See variations.]

C[The marked white stones are in danger! Play A or even B, to help them. A is a little more risky, but is able to kill black, as mentioned earlier.]

(;B[aq]LB[dq:A]C[A had killed your stones. Lokk at the variation.];W[dq]
;B[gn];W[fo];B[jl];W[jn]LB[kg:A]C[There are bigger moves, than saving a single stone with no purpose. What about A?]
;B[il]C[There was no cut. So no need for black to connect.];W[go];B[hn]

(;W[ar]C[Black is allready dead. No need for this stone. See variation.]

;B[lg];W[jd]C[Some generall comments:
You have a good skill for tricky situations, which helped you catching the stone around M4, L16 or B6 which actually lead to the winning of that game.
In the opening and early middle game, you tend to put stones in an area, where your oppononent is strong. That is, as I mentioned in the game, in general not good. Try to think of it like this: "If my opponent had played somewhere very often, it is ok, that he gains some territory there. I will make him playing there same more times, in order to build my own positions with the forcing moves, that I play."
After some experience with this principle, you will see, that your own positions often grow faster, that the ones of your opponent.
If there is a problem, like the life of the stones on the right side, take some time and make a plan, what you want to do. It is better, than playing at different plans at the same time.]

But with so many black stones around, it would probably be a delight for him, to attack you. And there is still the cut at A... And one stone of your ponnuki is in atari. To many things to look after at one time.]
