AB[pd][dp][pp]C[hot: Thanks for taking a look at it! ^^

hot: I'm most interested in fighting and tsumego... But I love go and would appreciate comments on any aspect of the game! ^^


Fighting: Have you read the book "Attack and Defense"? If you haven't then you must get a copy and read it, particularly the first few chapters.

If you have read it before, read it again!

You get into a really great attacking position in this game, and then throw it away. Such a waste. And A&D is one of the best go books ever. Everyone should read it at least 4 or 5 times as they get progressively stronger.


Tsumego: Well, you can never study too many life and death problems, so if you enjoy them, great! It wasn't so relevant to this game, but a really good knowledge of life and death is a great foundation to build the rest of your game on, and L&D problems are really good reading practice.


Opening (You mention this in a comment during the game): The key think is to look for moves that do two things at once. The things that an opening move can do are:

A. Expand your area.
B. Reduce their area.
C. Strengthen your weak position.
D. Weaken his weak position.

These are intentionally written in quite a vague way, and you can interpret them quite freely.

For example, a san ren sei move is good becauase it extends from two corners simultaneously, so it does purpose A twice.

If there is a white stone in one corner, and a black stone in the other, then a move in the middle is good, because it does both A and B.

The other really important thing in the opening is the saying "urgent points before big points". Which basically mean that if there is weak position on the board, C and D are more important than A and B (but still try to find a C or D that is also an A or B. For example, a pincer move that is also an extension from your other corner is a great move.]
;W[de];B[dc]LB[pj:A]C[Why you immediately play in the one part of the board where white is strongest?

This is not a bad move, but did you consider other things? For example A, making a san ren sei would also be a great move, and does not give white a chance to start a fight.]
;W[fd];B[fc]
(;W[cc]LB[gd:A]C[This white move is not joseki.

It gives black a chance to play A, which gives you access to the outside. (but probably play some forcing moves in the corner first)]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[gd];W[fe]LB[cb:A]C[Yes, good.

It would be a bit better if you had played the hane at A during the sequence.]

(;B[dj]TR[jd][pj][jp]C[hot: I am really clueless about fuseki, you see... It's beyound not knowing what to chose - I simply didn't know how should the top left be played out.

Tim: At first glance, any of the 4 marked points look like the next biggest opening moves. How to choose which is biggest?

You need to look at the various black and white positions, and decide how strong they are. I think that the white group is strong. Look at the variations. It can either extend into the corner, or along the side, so it probably has space for two eyes, so you can't attack it, so the move you payed is not so good, it extends towards a strong position.

The two moves that make a san ren sei, on the bottom and on the right, are both good big moves. I think that the one on the right is biggest. If you make a moyo on the right, the black stone at G16 makes a distant contribution to the moyo. If you make a moyo at the bottom, white's strong position at the top will make it easier to reduce the moyo.

However, the proverb says "urgent points before big points". Making a moyo is big, but are your black stones at the top strong enough to ignore? Could you cope if white cuts at G17? I'm not sure. It could be nasty. I think it is important to make it a bit stronger, either with the marked move or another nearby. If you make that group strong, you can't be attacked, and also it starts to make territory at the top, so it is a dual purpose move which is good.]
;W[db]
(;B[hc]C[Do you need to defend here? White has played a lot of moves in this corner (two more than you), so it is OK if makes some territory here. Also, he is already alive, so it does not matter if he captures a few stones and makes a few more eyes.

If you connect all you stones together , you will then be obliged to defend the group if attacked. If you give them up, you have no liabilities.

Look at the variation for an alternative plan.];W[dd]
(;B[ec]C[Same comment, the stones in the corner are not important.]

(;W[nq]C[White has the wrong idea.];B[qn];W[pr]
(;B[mq]C[Why play here? This is a special-purpose move, and it can get complicated, which white will like.]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[nr];W[or]C[This is wrong. White should play P3.]

(;B[np];W[oq];B[jq]C[hot: Same for this corner... I'm really interested in getting into a big messy fight, you see - I like these parts :)

Tim: The variation for 24 is better for you. Here, white is basically alive in the corner, since N2 and R3 are miai.]
;W[kq];B[kr];W[kp];B[mr]C[The last 4 moves are a mistake by white. Black is a lot stronger, so the white stones in the corner are about to die, and the white stones on the outside are only a tiny bit stronger (4 liberties instead of 3).]
;W[jp];B[iq];W[op];B[no];W[oo];B[nn];W[pm];B[on]
(;W[po];B[pn];W[rp]TR[pj]C[hot: And How should black attack L4 now? Would L6 do?

Tim: Attacking stright away is not the only plan. I would like to play at the marked point. I strengthens your 7 stones before white has a chance to attack, and makes a moyo on the right side. (Probably play the 42-43 exchange from the game first.)

Atacking is also a good plan, but L6 is probably teh wrong direction. The choice is (around) L6, or around H5. I think that H5 is much more useful for your game, making a big moyo in the bottom left while attacking. (That's  a dual purpose move again.)]
;B[ro];W[qo]C[Good exchange.]
(;B[rn]C[hot: Sometimes I surprise myself in a bad way ^^ - Must be the pressure ^^

Tim: Yes. White is  alive in the corner, so saving that one stone is worth about 8 points. There are much bigger moves.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[ho];B[gp]C[You should be happy here. White is still weak, and he has just forced you to make 4th line territory.]
;W[qf]
(;B[qi]C[hot: This is an interesting part - How can I attack L4?

I think that the right side is more important now. You are right to play a pincer.

When you attack the L4 group, the choice is either for you to play moves that expand the bottom left, and have white run into the middle, or play moves that expan the right and centre, and have white run into the left edge. I think you should keep your options open.]
;W[pi]C[Strange.];B[ph]C[Separating white is probably the natural idea. It will get complicated, but you seem to get a good result, which is what one would expect, there are many more black stones than white on this edge to start with.]
;W[qh];B[qj]
(;W[pj];B[pk];W[ok];B[qk];W[qg];B[oh];W[ni];B[of]C[This looks like the right plan. I don't think you need to be more agressive. White has to grovel to live on the side, while you build a wall that makes a nice moyo at the top, and white still has two weak groups in the middle for you to torment. After this move, you don't have any weak groups.]
;W[rd];B[qc]C[hot: Would it be possible (possible or not... would it be a good idea?) to pressure a bit more here?

Tim: See the previous comment. If the simple line gives you a great position, don't give yourself a head-ache.]
;W[rc]C[hot: R15 here?

Tim: That's a bad move. Helps white more than it helps you.]
;B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[pe];B[oe]C[White makes you really strong in his quest for eyes. Just say  "thank you".]
;W[sb]C[Can you play S19 in sente?]
(;B[kn]C[hot: Was this a good idea? I'm still trying to attack Q10 or this so I didn't play closer to the cut at J5...  But it feels not too good here... :(

It is normally wrong to cut a weak group in half. It jsut makes it easier for white to sacrifice one half! Attack the whole group.

There are two weak white groups, so the natural plan is a splitting attack. You want a move in the middle that attacks both groups. So your move is quite good. But it might be possible to do better. The two weak groups are quite a long way apart, if you can chase them a little closer first, you might me able to engineer a splitting move that has a bigger effect on both groups. That's the general idea. I am not sure how best to achieve it here.]
;W[in];B[jo]C[hot: I know it and the few following moves seem bad but what could I do instead?

Same comment: don't cut weak groups in half.

F6 is a dual purpose attacking move that expands your moyo. 

Alternatively, switch and play your next move near the other weak group.]
;W[jn];B[ko]
(;W[io]C[This is a mistake by white. The black group at the bottom and the one on the right are both alive. So the 6 white cutting stones have no value.]
;B[kl]C[Good. Now your splitting attack is getting better and better.]
;W[km];B[lm];W[jm];B[ln];W[ll];B[kk];W[ml]
(;B[li]TR[kk][kl]C[I don't like this. It is a shape that is a bit weak, and it just tries to captures some white stones on a small scale. You have a really great large-scale splitting attack going. If you just keep the two marked stones strong, then white has big headaches, and you have an easy time.]
;W[lj];B[kj];W[lh]
(;B[nh]C[hot: Did I have another choice here?

Tim: Yes, just connect at L11];W[mi];B[ki];W[mh];B[lf]C[This is good. Make territory at the top while attacking]
;W[kh]
(;B[hf]C[hot: And was this bad? :) I think I could've aimed at K6 to press a bit before...

Bot this is terrible!

You have to jump out with your stones in the centre. Keep them strong, so white has to do all the worrying.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[nm];B[mo];W[lo];B[mn];W[om];B[rh]C[hot: This is a safety move since I've wasted my time and didn't want to get into a worse mess now... Looking at it again... Doesn't seem too good... I probably should've used Whites weakness only I have no clue as to how to do it... (Or of course try to secure my territory in the buttom left? Too good a time to invade now it seems...)

Tim: I am fairly sure you group is alive without this. So you should play int he centre to defend you cutting stones.]
;W[rg];B[ri];W[ii]C[Suddenly white has a chance to save the game.

By the way, S19 is now definitely your sente, but you don't have time to play it now. (Don't worry, R18 is gote for white, so you won't lose the chance to play S19 later.)]
;B[ik]C[Does this work? If not, it is a bad mistake.];W[go]

(;B[fp]C[Argh! you don't have time for this!

You must jump out again with your cutting stones while you have the chance. White can't do any serious damage at the bottom anyway. (White should have plyed H9 with his last move).]
;W[hk]C[hot: I wished I had more time to think here but I was into byoyomi and even now when I'm looking at it... I'm not too sure what could I have done? There's some aji I thought but...
