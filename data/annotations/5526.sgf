C[Hello Riaan!

I will mark my comments with "R:" I hope it will help you to advance.

-------

Dear reviewer,

I am TrueOrgan (8k) playing against hirurg (7k) on KGS.  I felt that I played pretty well, but cannot help but feel that I overlooked some obvious moves.  In the end I lost by about 8.5 points.

I would appreciate it if you would help me by pointing out some of my weaknesses, especially in the fuseki.

Thanks in advance,
Riaan

;W[ee];B[cg]TR[dj]C[This move should be higher? Maybe D13?

R: you may not play here. Black's shimari is quiet strong, white stone cannot harm them. Marked stone has a miai extension on upper or lower side.  White is the one who has to worry. If you want to attack, simply extend at the top.]

(;B[pj]LB[bd:A]C[Was this the correct move? Perhaps R6 is better? What would you suggest?

R: Destroying white's base would be the best. (see var)];W[jd]

(;B[jb]TR[he]C[Here I was afraid of being closed off, so I chose to create a solid base for my group, while making life for k16 difficult. I also considered attacking from the other side around N17.

R: you should try to separate the weak stone first. your group is out to the center and white k16 is under attack. Of course white can create some kind of broken base, but still in danger. Beeing black H17 in low position K16 is not very effective.]

(;B[id]C[This was a hasty move, very slow and bad shape.  Jumping at H15 would be better locally?  I chose this move to create L16 cut.

R: Black can simply cut.];W[qc]C[R: its bad to create another weak group for white. One of them is surely dead. Black should exploit this. Separate the two group firmly. White can not deffend every weak group and eventualy black will destroy one of them.]

;B[kd]C[R: Yes its ok, but now (as white completely destroyed her own escape route) no need to play this move. White is dead here.]

(;B[rf]C[R: Loosing your cutting stones is big mistake here. Black's tremendous outer influence greatly reduced. (see var, but the first mistake was not to capture in ladder before)]

(;B[qk]C[R:You can consider not to answer.];W[ql];B[ih]C[Here I thought I could net the k14 group, but did not read far enough, forces are spread too thinly.  Would there be a way to kill k14 group?

R: Actually, you *have* killed  K15 group. Only missed the atari.

R: (Black is not thin. Only N15 group has to worry somewhat but it is already run out of the center. White has to worry about her corner *and* center groups. Its quiet hard to save both.)]
;W[kg];B[kh];W[jh];B[ji];W[ig];B[if];W[jg]C[R: here, you killed white. I wont show, you will find it, im sure. :-)]
;B[li];W[hh];B[ii];W[hf]C[R: worst case. White managed to connect.

Black's current move is small gote.];W[pq];B[nr];W[fj]LB[cq:B]
[dq:A]C[Here I realised that the white moyo had become very large and powerful, but fear it was too late by this stage.  How could this have been avoided?  Is there any way to attack this large territory?

R: Its very risky to invade white moyo for now. Reduce is an option. But White is leading about 30 points, Black definitely *must* invade or surrender. You can try invade at A, or B. 
(Please notice D15 group even now has no 2 eyes.)]

;B[hn];W[go];B[im];W[hl];B[km]C[R: It seems to be small, (save 1 stone in gote?) you should try to reduce further. Play every sente attack, kill everything what you can, invade.  :)]
;W[dm];B[em];W[bh]C[R: Black's  charge slowed down at move 143.. the counterattack hurts.]

C[R: B10 seems better. Helps to live if needed. And we can say there is very little chanche that white wont play at B10 now, so the invasion is over anyway.]
;W[bj];B[aj];W[bm];B[ak];W[ag];B[bg];W[af];B[ah];W[ae]
(;B[il]TR[pl][ql][om][on]C[Here I wanted to start securing my piece of the center territory.  Is this a good idea?  What would be a better plan?

R: its not a realy good plan, sorry. Consider the marked white stones. There is no center territory. (Althrought White let you make it in this game) Only few points can be collected in gote. Keep sente! Play out every attack that you can (in sente) if you think you can win by territory. At the end collect these points. If you think you are short in territory, carefully plan a trap and invade or kill something.]

[jk][kk][lk][jl][kl][jm]C[R: As you can see, even if white lets you make the territory, the whole plan resulted in ~13 points and two (!) gote moves needed. Its very important to keep sente.]
;W[lm];B[js];W[is];B[ks];W[hr];B[ba];W[ab];B[fb]C[R: is it realy needed?]

(;B[lh];W[mi];B[lj];W[ni];B[jo]TR[he][gj][do][qs]C[R: there are some more powerful moves...

R: General comments? In the fuseki you were very cautious and then you attacked fericiously. Try to be more ballanced. Its ok to attack weak groups in the fuseki, and important to keep them weak. Try to *separate* groups even if it seems all your territory is get lost. Your opponent cannot play 2 or 3 stones in one turn! If (s)he creates many weak groups you will eventually catch one. Or maybe massacre all.

In the endgame you managed to reduce lot of territory. Very good. But try to keep sente, and dont try to make small territories in the center. Sentes first. :)

Thanks for listnening, I hope it will help you to advance. 

cheers,
