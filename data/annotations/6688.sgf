C[Hello, I hope my comments help! Your biggest problem 
seems to be the opening. I think looking through pro 
games and learning some fuseki will really help you 
improve. If you don't have a thing to study fuseki, perhaps 
check out Kogo's Joseki Dictionary.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]

Overall, your middle game was very good, but your 
opening was too hard to recover from. The biggest thing 
to do is to remember that in the opening, it is very good to 
try to have both territory AND influence.

Youquestions and thoughts show that you put a lot of 
thought into your game, which is very good. I recommend 
learning different corner fuseki for certain situations and to 
remember that the san-san invasion is not always best.

Thanks a lot for letting me review this game! It was very 
interesting, especially the midgame. Good luck on 
improving!

You have the right idea. However, it is usually better to

much.
