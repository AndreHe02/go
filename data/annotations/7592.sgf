Dear doitsu,

overall this game is not so bad for you, there are just a few crucial things. My comments are marked with AB, I'm about 2K.





Dear reviewer,

I am working hard at the moment at my reading ability, but that is something i have to do by tsumego. I would apreciate your help especially in the corner sequences and with the subject of shape (i really lack a good understanding here).

I think i have a "beginner-good" understanding of strategy, so maybe this might be a good access to other subjects for me.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[or];B[lq]LB[qq:a]C[AB: This is just a small thing, but I think it is not so good as it gains nothing. Taking 3-3 would be normal.]
;W[mq];B[mo];W[qp]LB[po:B][qo:C][pq:A]C[I thought about Black 'A' here. 'B' seemed good shape to me. After all: I wanted the uppder right side - thats why i played C - do these thoughts make sense to you or is there a "bug"?]
N[corner decision];B[qo]C[AB: I think the move is good, nothing to worry about here.]
;W[qq];B[lp]C[AB: Very good, only move.];W[nd];B[pf];W[fc]LB[jb:B]
[hc:D][jc:A][jf:C]C[I really wondered about this move. Its obvious to me, that he wants to go for k16 later. I wanted to keep him seperated, but A or B seemed to slow to me, so i played C. D was a move I was also considering.]
;B[jf]TR[fc][nd]LB[df:a]C[AB: I think your move is ok. Yes, if you play something like D14 then White will almost certainly play K14. With nine stones handicap your move is good, because it should simplify the game. Otherwise, D14 is probably slightly better. For you the important strategic issue is to keep White separated. But K16 does that already by itself.]
;W[df]C[AB: So far the game is very good for Black, no serious mistakes have happened.]
;B[cc]LB[fd:a][ef:b]C[AB: Well, well... :-). I guess this move is actually the strongest possible move, so I cannot critizise it. You live in the corner and can separate White  outside again. If you succeed doing that you will have a great advantage, but if you are able to do that you don't need nine stones of handicap :-). The variation to live in the corner is quite complicated, I will look it up :-). Here, maybe a simple variation, attaching on either White stone would give you an acceptable result without too much risk.






I did not want to give him the corner immediately. I hear somewhere that "you should not get hemmed in" and "to poke between the double kakari". But  I thought "I can cut him here and make a stable base in the corner" - so why not ?

I think a lost the game with the following sequence - something went terribly wrong in the early moves and i would apreciate your help here.]
;W[fe];B[ef]C[AB: Good.];W[ee];B[de];W[cf];B[be]C[AB: Good.]
;W[bf]C[I should have made life now...]
(;B[ch]TR[ef]LB[eg:a]C[AB: This is indeed a crucial moment. I think you can probably still afford to play on the outside one more time, which you should use to support your absolutely essential cutting stone (ok, the ladder works for you, but still that gives White plenty of options). Then living is necessary, see variation.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[eg];B[ff];W[fg];B[gf];W[ge];B[di];W[dg];B[hf]
C[AB: The whole sequence looks unusual, but I cannot find anything particularly wrong about it. If you live in the corner, the result will be very good for you.]
;W[db]
(;B[he]LB[cb:a]C[AB: I guess this must be a crucial mistake. Probably you can still live in the corner by simply blocking.]
;W[cb]C[AB: Now I think the corner is dead... This, of course, changes everything. Still, White's two outside groups are not that strong, so you might enclose White and force him to remove the Black corner stones, which would limit the damage.]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[gd]LB[hd:a]C[AB: Simply H16 is also sente and leaves no cutting points.]
;W[fd];B[gc];W[gb];B[fb];W[fa];B[ic]LB[fi:a]C[AB: Here you end in gote without having achieved much of anything. I think you should be aware of that. Losing the initiative is big. If you had skipped the whole sequence starting with G16 and instead put pressure on the other White group, e.g., with a simple move, such as F11, threatening to enclose him, it would have been much better.]
;W[dn]C[What is apropriate here ?];B[eo]LB[fp:a][fi:b]C[AB: This is indeed not so easy. I think your move is not bad. Or simply F4, calmly focussing on the lower side. Still, F11 is an option. There is the risk that White would ignore it. Mmh, F4 seems best after all.]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[AB: Not sure the direction is wrong. Just imagine the other way, you would drive White towards your weak group, especially with D6 already on the fouth line. The wall you create with your move should be able to support your group.



Wrong direction - my group at d10 is to weak to fomr terrotory/attack.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[fl];B[dl]C[AB: I can't really make up my mind about this move. It's good, because it gives your group room. Then it's not good, because it forces White to play a good move in response.]
;W[em];B[fh]LB[fj:a][fi:b]C[AB: You drive White from behind to the center, this cannot be good. Yes, you need to move out as well to apply pressure both above and below. I think F10 or F11 would be more suitable.]
;W[gg];B[gh];W[hg];B[gj]LB[ih:a]C[AB: Maybe you can finally enclose White with J12?]
;W[hk]
(;B[jl]C[AB: I think this little move is a crucial mistake. You simply don't have the time to protect your framework on the right. The focus is on the battle on the left and you cannot take a break there. In fact, you should have the advantage in the fight, because you have only one group to look after, White has two. With the next move White closes you in and the situation changes completely. I think simply cutting throught the keima will be good. It gives you security and forces White to travel through No-Mans-Land. See variation.]
;W[hj];B[hh];W[ig];B[jg];W[ih];B[ii];W[hi];B[jh];W[ce]C[AB: See! Now that White is enclosed he must play on the inside. Black must pay attention now, though.]
(;B[hm]C[AB: Judging from what comes next this is a mistake. I think Black is just to weak on the inside to be able to afford this move. Is there not a possibility around C6 (see variation)?]
;W[fj]C[AB: Yes, the shape thing :-). At least you now have a hands-on experience why it is important.


Things like this really surprise me - i just don't see them coming.]
;B[ej]C[AB: Connecting E11 right away was better.


Don't tell anybody about this move :/];W[gi];B[ei]LB[fj:1][ei:2]
[gi:3][ej:4]C[AB: If you do tewari analysis (reordering the moves) it now looks like you answered G11 with E10.]
;W[cm]C[AB: Now you can no longer connect.];B[cl];W[bn]C[I suffered from this one later...]
;B[bp];W[bl];B[gr];W[bj]C[AB: Black is dead. This probably means that White just needs one living group on the right side to win, which should be easy.]
;B[oc]LB[pc:A]C[AB: No, your move is better. The corner is safe.


I think A might have been better...];W[qn];B[ro];W[pn];B[po]
;W[rj]C[AB: Hopeless for who? Not for White, it should be not too hard to make a living group here.


I think this is hopeless... but I don't seem to be right.];B[rl]
;W[qg]C[AB: That's it already. No way you can kill this.];B[qf]
LB[rf:A]C[AB: No, again I think the move you played is better. If you play S14 there is the peep at R15, which can be annoying.


Maybe 'A' would have been better ?];W[rf];B[re];W[rh];B[sf]
;W[sg];B[rg];W[ql];B[rm]C[AB: Maybe you can ignore the threat and take the ko, which is big. Hard to say.]
;W[rf];B[ed];W[fb];B[rg];W[jk];B[kk]C[AB: Again, I'm not sure. Let's see: You take the ko, White enters the framework, you kill the bottom left. Sounds possible to me.]
;W[rf];B[sr]C[AB: Q3 right away would have been a threat, this is just a big endgame.]
;W[se];B[pq];W[oh];B[rd];W[og];B[of];W[mg];B[me];W[sd];B[sc]
;W[sf];B[qk]C[AB: Good!];W[ja];B[kb];W[ka];B[ia];W[ib];B[la]

C[Pessi [3d\]: heh naw, im not getting bored :)];B[ap];W[br]
;B[gs];W[es];B[pr]TR[sr]C[AB: You see that T2 is useless now, in fact -1 point in gote.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[hl];B[im];W[ll];B[km];W[lm];B[ln];W[gm];B[gn]
C[AB: Yes, the rest is endgame. Overall you played many good moves and only a few bad ones. Basically, twice you ignored your own groups in danger. Moves that affect the balance of power between groups are very important. If you are in a battle where groups are not alive yet and you strenghten your own group, it automatically reduces
the relative strength of the opponent's group. Especially in the upper left corner: If you have two eyes there, your opponent is cut and has two weak groups. You are at least guaranteed to hold the initiative throughout most of the game then. 

Hope you found some of my comments helpful, if you have any further questions don't hesitate to contact me.
