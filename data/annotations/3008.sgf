RE[B+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[[tartuffe\] Hi, I played white in this game.  There was lots of fighting in the game, and I seemed to recover from a loss on the left side until disaster hit and I resigned.  I made a really bad move too quickly and that swiftly led to my resignation.  Other than a couple blunders this is pretty representative of my play.

I would appreciate comments on:
*fighting:  am I missing clever tesuji?
* influence:  I'm trying to get a feel for developing and using influence, so any help here would be nice
* big/urgent plays I'm missing
* anything else you think could help my game... my rank has settled here, and I would like to advance.
* if you feel like commenting black moves, too, I will send the game to the black player (though he did not ask for the review, I'm sure he would read it).
Thank you very much for your help!  I sincerely appreciate your time and effort.

Peter (tartuffe on KGS)

Kudos to the good people at GTL, too. :)];B[pd];W[ed]C[[tartuffe\] I'm experimenting with the 5-4 :)
:))];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo];W[jq];B[lq]LB[mq:A]C[[tartuffe\] m3 seemed a little small? Or is this normal?

i think is not too small; black lost sente, but secure lot,s of points. black prevents white A later.
white makes influence after that, but he,s territory is less secure.
so, black,s move is not necessary bad.];W[jo];B[dj]LB[cn:A]
[cq:B]C[as i say..

black has A or B to reduce or invade white];W[dl]LB[cq:A]C[A remain a big point...]
;B[df];W[cd]C[[tartuffe\] I wasn't sure about this move... I wanted to protect the corner and prepare for a pincer.

is a good move. if you don,t play, is a big point for black]

(;B[cj]LB[cn:A][co:B]C[for this move i have serious doubt ..
sure, it,s look for A, but white can prevents that playng B, who also secure the corner

instead black C 10, i prefer C8];W[nc]LB[co:A]C[[tartuffe\] Did I need to do something about my d8 stone?  Would it be better to attack/invade the left side?

in this moment is not urgent point for white because one single move in this area don,t secure the all territory

later, A seems to be a good move];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[jc];B[qj]

(;W[ef]C[[tartuffe\] E14 okay?

indeed, it,s time to play around this point. 

i show you another option for black seems to be the same result as in the game.

but, instead E14, i think white should play D 12

white get more influence with D 12]

C[[tartuffe\] I thought this turned out well....];B[le]
(;W[je]LB[kd:B][md:A]C[[tartuffe\] I wanted to surround  the upper middle, but after the game I thought this was too lukewarm.  I put no pressure on blac, and the m15 extension from q16 and q14 seems a little long.  What would be a better move?

i think white A or B is better

some variations of white A];B[ne];W[oj]C[[tartuffe\] I didn't want black to build a huge moyo, and I've seen this move done before.  I was a little woried about a black n10, though.]
;B[pl];W[mp];B[lp];W[lo];B[mo]LB[ln:A]C[A is a big point for black, so ...]
;W[mn]C[n 6 must played];B[no]
(;W[ln]C[[tartuffe\] Is m6 needed?  I thought maybe m6 was too heavy/dense... but I also thought maybe m6 could help my p10 stone.

if white don, t play, is a big point for black; but i think O 6 is better ...

see variation];B[fk]C[[tartuffe\] How should I handle this?  Is it time for c4/d3?

not yet
:)];W[ek];B[ej];W[fl];B[gl];W[gk];B[fj]C[for now white choose the right moves, but the white next move is not verry good...]

(;W[fn]C[i think now is time to play in the corner, probably C5 is the best]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[em];W[dm];B[bo]
(;W[bn]C[[tartuffe\] I chose to do this since a black ponnuki would have less meaning facing a black wall... good idea?  The main problem is that this sequence eventually resulted in the loss of the d7 group.]

;B[kc];W[kb];B[mc];W[mb];B[jd];W[id];B[kd];W[jf]C[[tartuffe\] k14 overplay? :)  I thought the cuts left behind were not terribly dangerous.]
;B[ic];W[jb];B[ie];W[hd];B[he];W[gd]
(;B[ge]C[[tartuffe\] perhaps black h13 or g14 better now?  That's what I was expecting to see.]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[gg];B[ig]C[mistakes by black];W[if];B[hg];W[hf]
;B[gh]C[[tartuffe\] Black ended in gote, so I I felt that I should get into the right-center.  Would this be a good time to capture the e7 stones?]

(;W[kg]LB[kg:A][en:B];B[im]C[simpli capture is now efective]

(;W[in]C[[tartuffe\] d6/g6 much better, right?];B[en];W[fo]
C[[tartuffe\] Terrible move!!! I smacked my head against the wall after this one.]

;W[pk];B[ol];W[nk];B[qk];W[kr];B[kp];W[jp];B[hn];W[gn];B[dg]
;W[ns]C[[tartuffe\] Under time pressure now I made the losing move, failing to defend at e17.  In the very local sense, maybe n2 would be better?  The game is basically over here.  No need for any further comments. :(

Thank you very much for your help!

indeed, but black make some bad move in the centre too
:)
