C[Hello! I am 20k* on IGS, was BLACK in this game.     I completely loose, so I need to know, where I did wrong.     Thanks.

Review comments:
First there is a fight at the bottom that I think could have been played better, but I am not sure what is really best. It is maybe an 8k fight and I am only 10k! :-) White picks a good invasion point so some loss on your part cannot be helped. The position gets settled by a ko which you win, but white's ko threat is huge. You were at a disadvantage here, and what you needed to avoid was having the fight escalate to such a large scale. Instead you want to give up a small, early loss. I think part of the problem is that you did not choose a definite strategy of a base on the side or escape into the center, so you got neither. More important, you miss a chance to connect your weak group to the corner.

Later, when white has vulnerabilities you place some stones too deep in his territory and too close to his strength. You end up with a heavy group that hurts your stronger groups when you defend it. You don't end up exploiting white's true vulnerabilities or keeping the territory that is rightfully yours.

Advice: Study some 3-3 point invasion joseki or watch for these moves when you watch other games. Analyze the board in terms of strong and weak groups. Exploit your opponent's weak groups and try to avoid creating weak groups of your own unless your opponent is even weaker. If I understood and paid attention to this advice, my play would be better too. :)]

;B[cm];W[oc];B[nd]C[I  could find little things wrong with moves to this point, but basicly black looks to be  doing pretty well. You seem to have a reasonable grasp of opening play.]
;W[gq]C[This move starts some middle game fighting and it is where you start to lose some territory.]
;B[eq]LB[gp:A][hp:B][hr:C][io:D]C[This move is not wrong, but it leaves your bottom group weak. You will need to find a way to deal with that group.
The lettered moves would have helped your bottom group, but left your corner open to invasion. They might have had better results.]
;W[go];B[io]LB[mr:A][ir:B][hr:C][lr:D][kq:E]C[I am not sure, but I have feeling that this is not the best move. One of the lettered moves aiming for a base is probably better before you move into the center.]
;W[jq];B[jr]LB[jp:A][io:B]C[A might be better here. You end up playing several moves aiming at a base and then give them up and run into the center.
 This is inconsistant. It is often good to play one or two sacrifice stones to help you move in the opposite direction in sente, but that is not what happens here. You might have been better off to play consistently toward the center after you made the move B.]
;W[kr]
(;B[kq]LB[jp:A]C[You end up running into the center so maybe  A is better.]
;W[jp]
(;B[ip]C[This move says you don't care about the atari, but if you prevent it, I think you are a little stronger and maybe will get an eye or a life.]
;W[ir]C[This is a very common pattern, an atari of a stone on the 2nd line. You needed to be aware of this earlier and decide if it is something you need to prevent.]
;B[hr];W[js];B[hq]C[You have suffered a big loss. White has gained territory by capturing  3 stones and surrounding more space. Your remaining stones are weak. White's 2 stones are weak too, but he only has 2 stones at risk here.]
;W[hm]C[White makes a combined running and attacking move.]
;B[jm]LB[gr:A]C[You need to play at A as soon as possible. Once you have connected your group to the corner and it is alive, you can move into the center in strength.]

[gq][go][gn]CR[hr][hq][iq][ip][io][hn]C[You needed to make this move. Look at this position and see if you can see that w is stronger. White has invested fewer stones and has more liberties. You have been attacking a strong group using a weak group.]

;B[gp];W[qn];B[fn];W[po]C[Good work with the ko, but now you need to minimize the damge of white's ko threat.  Not an easy thing to do.]

(;B[rn]C[I was hoping that there was a way to save both the corner and the side, but I don't see it. That was a big ko threat.]

;W[jc];B[kb];W[kf]LB[cc:A][qc:B][gi:C][fg:D]C[Now, both sides groups are alive. Your groups used to be more vulnerable to invasion, but you have suffered those losses. Now it is whites groups that are vulnerable at the 3-3 points, A and B. White has a big claim on the center, but you can enter it from the top or the right side. Your left side can be expanded by a move around C or D. I think your chances are good. You need to find the biggest move.]
;B[pi]C[This move enters the center. It is good in that white might block the top group and claim a big territory here. I would probably go for a 3-3 point first.]
;W[ph];B[oi];W[nj];B[ni];W[mj]C[As long as white keeps answering these moves they work, but their value is getting smaller. White should probably protect his corners instead.]
;B[hi]C[I think this too far. White threatens to cut this stone off from your side.]
;W[eg]
(;B[bd]LB[cc:A]C[I would play A here. You want to destroy as much of white's territory as possible.]
;W[cc];B[ee]LB[fi:A]C[This is an overplay and may, in fact, lose the game for you. You are playing too much into white's strength. Defending this stone ends up taking away a lot of white's territory at the top, but it strengthens white so that he kills your top group and takes some of your territory on the left. I like A better. It supports your center stone and defends your side.]
;W[de];B[ff];W[fg];B[gf];W[gg];B[hg];W[df]LB[hf:A]C[I would have cut at A here. I think white is strong enough.]
