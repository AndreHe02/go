C[Dear reviewer,

My name is Christoph. I played this with Black on KGS and lost to an obviously stronger opponent. I got some ideas as to what my bad moves were and made some annotations, but I guess there is a lot more you can tell me. Looking forward to your comments.

Babibo :
Hi reviewee !
I'm Remi Vannier, 2d on KGS, and about 1k-1d in real life (but my french rank seems to be stuck at 4k...). 

I think go is an intuitive game. To be a good player, one has to calculate sequences, of course. But what one needs mostly to improve is a correct judgement. 

The purpose of this commentary is to give you a glimpse about how a 1d thinks, because I think your judgement can be wrong sometimes. Mine can be wrong too, so please don't take everything I say for granted. 

In real life, I'm teaching a group of 15k, and I realize how hard it is to teach this judgement to others. The best way I found is to repeat the same principes again and again (don't attach weak stones, don't use a wall for territory, etc...), telling them what I see in their games, weak groups, urgent moves, etc... And little by little, they unconsciously understand things and get to 6k in no time. Suddenly, the game of go is so simple, and they even wonder how they could think differently before ! I wish my commentaries will help you the same way. 

Finally, I would like to point out how important it is for a reviewer to have some of your own commentaries and questions on the game. Usually, these questions are about details compared to the global mistakes we make. However, they helped me a lot to understand what is wrong in your judgement (don't take it personnally : we all make mistakes).

Enjoy !

(;B[mc]C[Babibo : Wrong direction (hum : I just checked in a fuseki book because I was unsure. So I suppose you won't need to know this to be 2 dan !)]
;W[gc];B[qj]LB[qc:A][pj:B]C[I like this opening because it allows me an effective placement of my right upper 3 stones.

Babibo : don't be too sure about your fuseki judgement :) 
What is correct here is that you make a "double wing" extension with your corner stone. It makes a box-shaped moyo, which can become really large in that kind of situation
Second, you deprive the Q4 hoshi stone of its ideal extension at R10. 
With these 2 arguments, any move on this side is big. 

However, your shape has a big defect at R17. The san-san is open... Even if white doesn't invade right now, you'll need a move at R15 to secure your territory, which will be low (I mean on the 3rd line). Have a look at variation A...]

(;W[qf]C[Babibo : white is jealous. K4 is bigger, and R17 is wiser]
;B[qd]C[Babibo : Good move. Now white can't settle here];W[qm]

(;B[of]C[Babibo : 
Looks like a mistake in direction. You don't want white to escape at Q11, and P14 hasn't much value either. 

When attacking, think about the value of the attacking moves. Moves on the fifth line can serve 2 purposes : 
- build a moyo (here, it is not the case)
- attacking another group (splitting attack) : well, here, I think that G17-K17 group is solid and hard to attack at the moment.]
;W[ph];B[oj]C[with this move, white has an obvious continuation at O12. Your plan fails, I think.]
;W[nh];B[rh];W[pg];B[mj];W[lh]
(;B[lf]C[Chasing the w stones starts to pay off, allthough N14 might have been better.

Babibo : Pay off ? You may be talking about the O16 area ? It is pretty small, in fact, compared to the negative value of your weak group at P10, I think. 
And playing N14 instead of M14 ? This is a detail.]
(;W[mf]C[This move is horrible];B[me];W[le]C[This one too :)]

(;B[md]C[Babibo : Strange shape];W[nf];B[oe];W[kf]C[Because of my failure to play N14, W has come alive.

Babibo : Yes, white can be happy with that influence he gains. However, I think white was very hard to kill. And N14 or M14 are equivalent, frankly.]
;B[nm]C[Now I'm having a problem: While I'm strengthening my group, W gets vast amounts of territory.

I agree, the O7 move has no territorial value and not enough influence value.]
;W[kq];B[dj]C[Babibo : this move is weird. I don't like it, because a move on a third line is useful when building a moyo or attacking. That doesn't mean I would play C10 : it would be even worse to build such a flat territory on the third line. 

 I would play C6 instead, and then play D10 if white answers at F4. 

I'm pretty unsure about that. So forget it if you're not convinced.]
;W[cm];B[dr]C[should have been at R3 ?

Babibo : well, I don't know. Both are corners, and are equally big. In both cases, you won't be able to attack a group... 

Your move is ok : therer are no weak groups to attack, so taking the largest point is good. However, I can't decide which move is best in the area to take the corner in sente]
;W[eq];B[er];W[fr]
(;B[fq]C[I wonder if this move is necessary. Maybe it is.];W[gr]

(;B[dq]C[Babibo : pros usually say "Vulgar move !"];W[ep];B[cp]
;W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B[br];W[go]C[Huge success for white. There is a problem in this variation, because white was the first to get out of the joseki. I won't go any further in that direction, but you should be aware that white is happy]
;B[fe]LB[ch:A][fh:B]C[Should have been at R3 or E15 ?

Babibo : 
Mmmmh. This question in itself is interesting. 
Why would E15 or F15 be a good move ? 
1. to enlarge your C13 moyo ? 
2. to attack G17 stone ? 
3. Is it even sente ? 

1. No, there is no moyo at C13. It is open at B10, and there may even be an invasion at C12, because of white's powerful wall at the bottom. And if you don't get the side territory, (A area) there is no territorial potential in B area, because of the L14 influence. 
So the answer is no ! No moyo here. Only small yose territory.

2. You can't disconnect K17 from L14. So : no attack possible. 

3. arf, it is not sente...

So, take the biggest point : R3. With O7 in place, the wall white will get in compensation will mean nothing.]

1.hard situation for white => I should attach and create a messy fight
2. I have a big wall at the bottom => I should fight, disconnect something, and pray
3. There is no territory for black if I take the side territory => I don't mind being pushed on the 3rd line.
