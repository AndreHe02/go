RE[W+270.5]

C[I play black. I knew my opponent would be much  stronger. It's a game without handicap stones.

Hello,

my name is Peter Strempel, I am a german 7k player. I am happy to review your game.
It is quite a massacre on black, but assuming Whites 4k is correct, this is no big surprise.
I will try to point you to some mistakes you made - at least those I can see.]
;B[dp]TR[nf][oe][of][pd][pe][pf][qc][qd][qe][qf]C[As a matter of politeness, B starts in the upper right corner.]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[ce];B[pi]LB[dc:C][ec:D][jc:F][jp:A][nc:E][qf:B]
C[This move is doubtful.
- It does not attack white or force White to react
- It is too far away from Q4
- If you want to go for a moyo, consider K4 instead, as K4 would be an extension from two of your stones at the same time.

One of the points A-F look like good moves for black.
Generally, approaching a White corner is bigger. And for a moyo strategy, (A) is much superior than your Q11.]
;W[cn]C[Correct, W ignores your Q11 and approaches your corner.
Note this is the influence side of his upper left mokuhazushi (5-3), a move that was popular in the Edo period.]
;B[cl]C[Good response, it foils Whites plans for building a large scale framework on the left side, working well together with his C15 stone.]
;W[en]SQ[fp]C[W wants to attack your C8 stone.
You should play F4 next, this takes profit and would be too good for W to play. Also it attacks White.]

(;B[dn]C[Big mistake. This is a terrible move.
This makes life easy for white. Never cut though the ikken-tobi (1-point jump), unless you are
sure you can cut off one stone. It won't work here. See variation for a Joseki.]
;W[dm];B[do];W[cm]C[Black gained nothing and only hurt the C8 pincer stone with this sequence.]
;B[em];W[dl];B[fm]TR[fn]LB[el:A]C[Maybe I loose a corner, but I've got a good position, I  thought. I can take this white stone and have a body  there

E6 is not completely dead. To play safe, you could grip it in a ladder with F6 instead, but then W gets the good forcing move at (A).
And your C8 is completely useless now.];W[jp]C[W prevents B builds a huge moyo on the bottom.]
;B[ck]SQ[mq]C[Well, you rescue your stone, but on the left side you won't gain any profit. You can get a group there,
but it will be tiny and W gains influence from that. You could leave C9 in the board for now and attack
the K4 stones, maybe with N3 or so, what would be a nice extension from Q4 at the same time.]
;W[dk];B[cj];W[dj];B[id]LB[dc:A][ed:B]C[My line of the 3 stones would take too many moves to  capture now.

It is possible to capture them, but why should W do that? Those black stones won't do anything except making little points.
And while Black plays moves to life, W gains influence.

Your J16 is doubtful for one reason: It allows W to play the excellent point at D17 (A), a move W wants to play anyways.
Instead you might consider approaching at A or possibly B.]
;W[dc];B[di]C[Doesn't it look well? I could go over his wall and  danger it, or go to the stone I set the move before.

It looks good, consider a white hane at C11, this would be terrible.
On the other hand, you do not endanger the white stones. They can make an eye with B4, and still
run into the center.];W[ei];B[ej]C[Overly agressive. You have to play D12 instead. W can now eat your 3 stones by a cut at C11, what he did.]
;W[ci]C[Ouch.];B[dh]TR[cj][ck][cl]C[I'm not frightened. Doesn't look dangerous. But I'm  closer. (I thought)

It is dangerous, the 3 black stones are gone, W alive, and your D11/12 stones floating without a base.]
;W[ch];B[bm];W[bn];B[eh];W[fi];B[ek]C[Like on move 27. I'm just a bit closer.]
;W[el];B[fk];W[fl];B[gj];W[gm];B[fn];W[gn];B[fo];W[gk];B[fj]
C[WOW! What a defense he has!

Yes. But Black made it easy for White, too many cutting points all over.]
;W[gi];B[hj];W[hi];B[hl];W[hk];B[ij];W[gl];B[ii];W[gg];B[ff]
;W[fg];B[cg];W[bg];B[eg]TR[dh][di][eg][eh]C[Ugly shape here, Black will get squeezed.]
;W[ef];B[df]C[Why is my defense less successfull?];W[ee];B[bf]
;W[fh];B[bi];W[dg]C[I think I just failed to see that

That was the squeeze I mentioned 3 moves ago.];B[bh];W[cf];B[ah]
;W[aj]
(;B[gf];W[hf];B[ge]C[That was stupid I think now. To build up on skeleton  remnants.

Correct. Either you add dead stones, or you will get a tiny living group with 2 eyes, both not a success.
The right side or bottom are more interesting now.];W[he];B[gd]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[jc];B[ed];W[ic];B[fc];W[dd];B[ec];W[hb];B[ig]
;W[gc];B[hg]C[You are cutting two living white groups apart.
Cutting living groups is of no use.
And actually, you don't even cut, W can capture the four G15 stones in a snapback.]
;W[je];B[ke];W[jf];B[kg];W[jg];B[jh]C[That seems to be quite well again. I can settle in the  middle, and close up his might in the upper left corner.  Maybe I can later rescue my stones at the left wall.

Proverb says: "There is no territory in the center."

The right side is more interesting. You should approach Q16 at R14, or attack the K4 stone.]
;W[kh];B[lh];W[ki];B[kf];W[li];B[nh];W[mh];B[lg];W[mi]C[Its over with closing him up. He has a little but strong  position in the middle.]
;B[mg];W[ng];B[nf];W[og];B[kd];W[jd];B[od];W[pe];B[oe]C[I think I need a living realm to be able to seriously  attack him. There was a good chance - I take it.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[pg];B[kc];W[oi];B[nj];W[ni];B[oj];W[lk];B[mk]
;W[kl];B[jk];W[jl];B[lj];W[mj];B[kj];W[ml];B[nk];W[nl];B[pj]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[qm];B[om];W[ol];B[qk];W[pm];B[ph]C[Another living area at the right wall would be sure (I  thought)]
;W[oh];B[qg];W[qf];B[rc]LB[rg:A]C[I thought it must be possible to connect my 2 strong  areas. Then I would capture him in between.


Your group should live after playing (A).
S17 looks extremely strange to me. What does it do?
It does not connect your groups. White S13 cuts and probably kills.]
;W[qc];B[oc];W[pc];B[pa]C[??

Strange move. You played this later again around K19. You end in gote, so it cannot be good.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qa]C[He obviously thinks, that it is NOT possible for me to  connect my areas.

He is correct. :)];B[rb];W[oa];B[na];W[pa];B[nb];W[rg];B[qh]
;W[rh]C[This looks dangerous. W probably can kill.];B[ri];W[rj]
;B[rm];W[rn]
(;B[lm]LB[si:A]C[I don't know if Black can rescue the group. I think (A) makes Black alive. I tried some variations.]
;W[ll];B[im]C[OK, there is no more chance to win anymore. He  stopped me living in the middle, in the upper left and  on the right.  I have 1 sure area upward. Maybe I could  rescue 1 area left or right.  I will now make as much area as possible down there.  With my position in the lower left and my threats which  I played now . . . . .   No, you can't win anymore. But an even game on that strength difference is not meant to win for Black,
but to learn. :)];W[il];B[hm];W[jm];B[ho];W[hn];B[in];W[io]
C[How stupid I was !];B[kn];W[jn];B[mm];W[go];B[hp];W[fp];B[eo]
;W[gp];B[bo]LB[bp:A]C[If you want to live, then (A) instead should do it.
B5 is too close to White, after W pushes at C5 Black has too many cutting points.]
;W[co];B[bp];W[cp];B[cq];W[dq];B[eq];W[dr]LB[bq:A]C[White could also kill the corner with (A) and let you live around E6.
Both okay for White. I think killing the corner is slightly bigger.]
;B[cr];W[ep]C[INCREDIBLE!];B[er];W[ds];B[cs];W[en];B[an]C[OK, but I think I can live on the left here.]
;W[bl];B[aq]C[Well seen.];W[am];B[ao]C[It became small, but it lives :-)]
;W[qq];B[qn]LB[pq:B][qp:A]C[This cut only helps white.
Instead you might consider A or B.
But as K4 limits any area you might get there, B is not very attractive.
After A White will crawl on with B, so this isn't very attractive, too.

Black has just some stones splatterted against the strong W wall, so actually, there is nothing very
attractive for Black here to play anyways.];W[qo];B[pn];W[po]
;B[on];W[ro];B[rl];W[si];B[oo];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[mr]LB[nq:A]
C[Strange move. What does it do?
You should extend to O3 instead and try to make 2 eyes there.]
;W[nq];B[op];W[nr];B[mp];W[mq]C[Incredible how he got the corner, but I should get  another living area here.]
;B[np];W[lq];B[kp];W[kq];B[mo]C[Doesn't it look like already living?

No, O6 kills.];W[nn]C[Oops]
(;B[ja]C[Again your strange endgame move. Simply play K18.]

;W[db];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[ad]C[Maybe I get it alive!

No way.];W[ac];B[ag];W[cg]C[No, it doesn't work];B[qj];W[ri]
;B[sf];W[rf];B[re];W[ra];B[sb]C["Death in gote."

This should be avoided. You waste a move, and you still don't live.]
;W[sg]LB[ih:2][ji:1][jj:3]C[White actually does not need to play this. B is dead if W did ignore, and W does not need to make 2 eyes
as long he can connect his groups with K11 (1-2-3 sequence)]
;B[jq];W[jr];B[nm];W[ko];B[lp];W[jo]C[I tried out everything. grus stopped me everywhere to  live. 2 little isles are all I was allowed to get.


Well, Black got butchered. But I suppose it is a good experience, to play a player so much stronger on even terms.
You had no chance to win, but a chance to learn something. This is what such a game is about.

I hope I did not sound too mean in my review. I tried to point you to the mistakes you made and show why W managed
to win so easily. If you have further questions, feel free to email me at zotan@web.de]
