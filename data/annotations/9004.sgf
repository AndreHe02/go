C[Hello there! My name is David but I'm also known as SolarBear on the internets. I'll be your reviewer today.

Just so we're clear, I like to put links in the review about very basic stuff. You're certainly aware about most of it but I'm typing it all in case a weaker player ever reads this review (like I like to do for games a few stones over me).]
;B[pd]C[Please review for KGSfan, black.];W[cd];B[pq];W[qp]
C[D: Weird. As you might know, contact plays are discouraged in the opening.

I know you were playing Black but this needed to be said. :)]
(;B[pp]TR[pd][dp]C[Should this move be here?

D: Very good question! White's move was dubious, but answering in the wrong direction would hurt Black.

Direction of play is a very high-level concept (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Direction) that is kind of hard to grasp but here, in the opening, what's important is to consider where the opening moves were played. In this case, you need only consider the top right stone since the bottom left corner is still empty.

What does the 4-4 stone do? It puts emphasis on the sides (in this case the top and right) at the expense of the corner (because of the weakness at the 3-3 point). So, if you allow your opponent to settle on the right side, you're not following the direction dictated by your top stone.

See variations on the next move for further explanation.]
(;W[qq]C[D: Wrong answer from White here, that's called pushing from behind (http://senseis.xmp.net/?PushingFromBehind).]
(;B[po]C[D: Black goes too easy on White. Black should hane at R5. See var.]
;W[qo];B[mp]TR[pr][pq][pp][po]MA[lp]C[D: Not wide enough. The rule of thumb is to jump 1 space per unit of height of your wall, so it should've been at M4.

A larger jump around K4 would also have been possible if you're looking for a faster development at the expense of stability.]
;W[cp];B[fp]MA[ep]C[Is this good for black or not?

D: Black had the right idea! But since Black is very strong on the right, I'd play the E4, 1-space approach.]
;W[dr]C[D: WAY to passive. White is doing nothing except defending the corner.]
(;B[fr]MA[mp]C[D: This does nothing much except defend the side and, with the stone at N4 which is kind of high and far away, an invasion is still possible.

See var for an idea on how to proceed.];W[dm]C[D: Now White is spreading nicely along the right side.]
;B[cg]C[D: This is not good - good thing White did not take advantage of it! See var on next move.]
(;W[jq]
(;B[kq]C[Is this correct play? Should the attack be from top (K4) ?

D: No to both questions! Remember, the basic principle is the following :

contact = defense

Here, Black's Q3 group is very strong (so no need to defend them as Black did) while the group F4 stones are not strong so much. Black is in a very good position to attack this stone AND secure the F4 stones. See var.]
;W[kr]
(;B[lq]C[D: Extending here feels submissive, especially since the group on the right is much stronger than the one on the left. See var.]
;W[lr];B[jp]C[D: Good thinking : the F4 stones need love!];W[iq]
(;B[mr]C[D: Nope, Black is not getting much territory here anyway, leave whatever scrap White wants and build influence instead. See var.]
;W[gq];B[fq];W[gr];B[gp]C[D: Good thinking : if White had played G4 first, the stones would've had a MUCH harder time to live.]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[ip];B[io];W[hr]
(;B[ls]C[D: Small. Just take sente. See var.]
(;W[js];B[gs]C[D: Again, small. There are bigger points everywhere.]
;W[hs];B[qg]C[D: I don't like this. It ignores the lone C13 stone, does not use the bottom influence.]
;W[ql];B[qj]C[D: At least, Black is consistent.];W[nm]
(;B[nj]C[D: Submissive. Black is strong both at the bottom and right. See var.]
;W[pn];B[on];W[pm];B[om];W[ol]
(;B[nn]C[D: I didn't like this move but the cut at O8 doesn't really work (see var).]
;W[ml];B[mm];W[nl];B[lm];W[cj]C[D: Ouch. Black gets attacked and White secures his right side. This is very bad for Black!]
;B[de]MA[ec][ed][fd][fc]CR[eg]C[D: This only helps White strengthen the corner. Black's only options are either

A) playing a kind of double approach around E16
or
B) jumping to the center at E13

I don't like either but B) feels way too submissive.];W[dd]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[fd];W[fc];B[gd];W[gc];B[hc]CR[fe][hd]C[D: See? White gets rock solid territory in the top left corner while Black gets... not much. Some center influence but then gain he's left with some nasty cuts.]
;W[fg]
(;B[ge]C[Is this the best protection for black?

D: Nope, White could extend to F14 to force Black.

There are only 2 possible moves here, see vars for pros and cons.]
;W[mc];B[jc]MA[kc]C[D: Black is strong in this region. Pincering at L17 would've been more powerful.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[oc]C[D: Slow move. Safe but slow.];B[ne]C[D: Good move! Black is heavily restricting White's expansion AND expanding his right side. Black is pretty much having his cake and eating it, too.]
;W[mg]C[D: A reasonable move : White is trying to restrict, in turn, Black's expansion.]
(;B[ng]C[D: This is submissive. There is a move much more powerful than this one : see var.]
;W[mf];B[gg];W[fh];B[gh];W[fi];B[gi]C[D: Not a great exchange for White : he doesn't get anything while Black's group gets many more liberties.

The problem however is that... well, see var.]

(;B[ij]C[D: Good! The last move by White was very small, it was time to take sente.

But this move is small, too. Trying to expand a center group generally doesn't bring much profit. See vars for ideas.]
;W[im];B[hm];W[kl];B[ll];W[lk];B[jk]C[D: Bad sequence for Black, here.  This move does not gain much and ends up costing Black.]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[km]C[D: Black is the one that ends up hurt.]

[np][eq][mq][oq][nr]C[I would like to know where I made the biggest mistakes.

D: I think I highlighted well most of your bad moves - and a few good ones, too! But to sum up:

1. Black really let White build the left side without much to keep him in check. Invade or reduce but you MUST stop your opponent from expanding too easily!
2. I found your opening too "tame", for lack of a better word. Very small extensions, loose pincers, far approach at F4, very little pressure on White's invading stones are examples that come to mind. You need to determine what strength you have and learn to use it properly. Strength is meant to attack, too, not make territory : see comments and variations at move 17 for what I mean.
3. In the endgame I've noted many slow moves. Learn the usual endgame moves and tesuji, make a mental list of the available moves and go for the biggest, sente ones first - as a rough guideline, all books I've read consider that a sente move is worth twice as much as a gote move, so a 2-point sente move is equivalent to a 4-point, gote one. Endgame tsumego would help tremendously.
4. Keep your groups connected! White could've easily killed both the F2 and A15 groups, you're lucky he didn't.

I hope this review helps you! If you have ANY further questions, you can drop me a line at solarbear AT gmail DAWT com.]
