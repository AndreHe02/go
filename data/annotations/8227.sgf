C[Hallo!

Please review for Black. It should be a more simple review since this was a "race of moyo"-style game and somehow I didn't make the big enough moves. It's enough if you point out the deciding mistakes.

Please be aware of an important strategic rule of myself: I try to avoid playing in my opponents sphere of influence as long as possible (i.e. till there are no big enough moves in my shpere of influence or in a neutral area to win the game).


mafu: Hi, I'm your reviewer. Let me advertise my blog at http://blog.mafutrct.de

In a moyo game, it is very important to see which moves in the center need to be answered and which don't. You both played too mild at times (nobi instead of double hane) and also answered small moves (15 points instead of 30 point invasion). That immediately changes the expected outcome of the moyo game, especially when there are no weak groups. and remember to count and read ahead and count again!

About your style: I believe being strong at fighting is required to understand why you should not fight too often. If you feel that you should invade and/or fight, then do it - and if you're unsure, do it too, just for the excercise (exception: tournament game). So don't be afraid. Playing calm does not help you progress as much as understanding fighting better does.

Good luck and Thank you for your presentation];B[pd]C[taizann [1d\]: 4649]

C[mafu: This looks small. White has A, which is huge. In the center, white has the BCDEF sequence so black is limited.

For black, I would play G or better yet H instead]
(;W[ld]LB[mc:C][qc:A][fo:B]C[mafu: This looks natural, but white must consider A or B as well. If we say A and C are miai, then B is a must for white.

After this white move, white A became smaller as it is only affecting points but not life so white maybe hurt herself.]
;B[fo]C[mafu: very big move];W[er]LB[kg:B][dr:A]C[rs220675: too small?

mafu: It is very big and sente. White A instead is gote but a lot better yose. White B might be better]
;B[fr];W[kf]C[mafu: looks slow, I want to jump more to use the 3 solid white stones!]
;B[lg]LB[nk:A]C[rs220675: Is this move big enough? I think it's not. What do you think?
