C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing this game.  I seem to have reached a point where everything is spiralling out of control when I play, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing wrong.  If I attack, I end up with weak groups all over the board; if I try to make strong groups, I give up far too much territory (and get criticized by stronger players for playing too passively).

YJ - If you can at least learn one thing per game reviewed, you will become a strong player in no time. I hope this review will help you achieve that.

To make matters worse, I've lost any confidence that I might get a good position out of any attacks.  If I do get a good position, it's a wonderful surprise.  If not, well, I'm no longer surprised, because this is what *always* happens when I attack.

YJ - Perhaps you should review your goals in attacking. There are a few things to keep in mind when attacking. First, is the group you are attacking weak? Your assessment can only improve as you play more games.
Second, what are your goals for attacking? There are at least 3 possibilities to consider: (1) to capture the group, (2) to use the attack to gain territory in other parts of the board, (3) to intrude into opponent's moyo and reduce his territory. (1) is occurs very rarely, unless you are playing with someone a lot weaker than you are. (2) and (3) are the more realisable type of benefit in attacking.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger

;B[dn]TR[cj][dj]C[YJ - This is an odd move. B gr still does not have enough eyespace to be settled. More conventional at C10 or D10.]

(;W[nc]TR[ck]C[Fedya: I figured my group at the bottom was settled, so I could approach Black in another corner.

YJ - That's fine. But I would have played C9 immediately to put pressure on B. But my objectives is not to capture the entire B gr but to gain some territory on the bottom right side as b makes its escape.]
;B[ce];W[cg]C[Fedya: I thought this would be a good move in that it puts pressure on the C15 stone and keeps Black from taking the entire left side of the board.

YJ - Not quite. This move puts w in bad position later.];B[ed]
;W[ec];B[fd]
(;W[cj]TR[fc]C[YJ - either this or F17, w suffers.];B[dk];W[dj]
TR[fc]C[YJ - w must extend with F17];B[dg];W[dh];B[eg];W[eh]
;B[bh]TR[bg]C[Fedya: I wasn't certain what the best thing to do here was.  I believed I had to worry about Black cutting at C12, while at the same time try to stop Black from connecting the B12 stone to either of the other Black groups.

YJ - this move does not seem to stand. white can achieve all the above by playing B13.]
;W[bg];B[bj];W[bk]C[YJ - correct.];B[ci];W[ch]C[Fedya: Would it have been better to play C9 here instead?]
;B[ck];W[di]TR[bl]C[YJ - wrong. should extend at B8 first.]
;B[bi]TR[bl]C[yj - b should have played B8.];W[bl];B[bm];W[ah]
;B[al];W[aj];B[fj];W[be]TR[bh][bi][ci][bj]SQ[ce][dg][eg][ed]
[fd]MA[gh]C[Fedya: I was looking for a way to get a second definite eye for the group, since if the eyespace is just the four dead Black stones, Black can kill.

YJ - Generally speaking, between moving towards the centre and playing to make eyes, the former is better. G12 is a possibility. F13 may be better, F11 is also a possible choice.]
;B[bd];W[ae]MA[bf]C[YJ - better to just play B14.];B[ad];W[bf]
C[Fedya: Now at least I've got my two eyes...];B[cc]TR[gc]SQ[fc]
C[Fedya: But now I have to worry about my group at the top.  I don't believe I can afford to sacrifice the stones, as I'd be giving up far too much territory.

YJ - 2 stones are not a lot. if necessary, sacrifice them. They may not be all useless after you decided to sacrafice them. For e.g., playing G17 would almost force b to play F17 to capture the 2 stones properly. In that way, w benefitted from the 2 sacrificed stones.]
;W[fc];B[dd];W[gd];B[gc]SQ[gd]C[Fedya: Every time my opponents cross-cut, it's a disaster to me.  But the last time I kept playing on the third line, I was strongly criticized by a stronger player for giving up too much territory.

YJ - So the hane at G16 is not good, unless you want to sacrifice the 3 w stones.]
;W[gb];B[hc];W[hb];B[ic];W[ib];B[jc];W[ne]C[Fedya: Not only did I get a bad result from the cross-cut, I have a weak group to worry about as well.

YJ - This is the end result of trying to save two stones which are rather useless already. It is a lot worse than just simply sacrificing them.]
;B[jb];W[cb];B[ea]TR[cb][dc][ec][fc][gb]C[YJ - Given w's marked configuration, E19 is almost always the crucial point to attack or defend against.]

(;W[bb]C[Fedya: I've looked at this for quite some time trying to figure out the best way to kill the E19 stone and ensure two eyes for myself.  Should I have played at F19?  I've looked at that and F18 as alternatives, and think F19 is more likely to work than F18.

I do life and death problems, but the problem I have with them is that I don't recognize the positions in the problems as being the ones that show up in my games.

YJ - Obviously, B18 didn't work. The best defense in this scenario is E18. See my variation 4.]
;B[fb];W[db]C[Fedya: I realized I couldn't play at E18 here.  D19 doesn't work, either.]
;B[ga];W[eb];B[ia];W[fa]C[Fedya: And now, I have to fight a ko.]
;B[cl];W[ai];B[fb];W[bc];B[cd];W[fa];B[nd];W[ha]C[Fedya: I decided to ignore Black's threat, since I didn't think it amounted to much.

YJ - it's actually a lot, but probably not as much as the top left gp. Besides, w has no more ko threats, so it's no choice.]
;B[md];W[qp]TR[gh]C[Fedya: I thought I had to go on the attack more.

YJ - clearly b is in the lead now. so naturally w has to play more aggressively. But i would think that the jump at G1 is rather big. Imagine if b plays there, the moyo would be complete and without much weakness and it would be very difficult for w to play.]
;B[po];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn];B[he]TR[fh]C[YJ - not the important point. F12 is better.]
;W[jq]TR[qc][gh][pm][qf][lq]C[YJ - better alternatives are marked.]
;B[ip];W[iq]TR[jp]SQ[ip]MA[pn][po][oq]C[Fedya: Would it have been better to play at H3 here?

YJ - locally, this is better but w do have to be a lot more agressive (e.g. k4, to attack b's j4 or Q5,Q6,P3) given that b is currently way ahead.]
;B[gq];W[fq];B[hp];W[hq];B[go];W[gr];B[ko];W[ql]MA[pm]C[YJ - the hane at q7 is better.]
;B[pm];W[qm]C[YJ - no danger here.];B[ok]
(;W[qf];B[qj];W[qc]MA[qf][qj]C[Fedya: Now at least I should get a stable group in the top right corner.  The only problem is that it ended up costing me both the R14 stone, and the entire center.

YJ - Consider this : w didn't play R14/R10 exchange with b but played R17 straightaway, where would black have blocked?]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[nb]C[Fedya: I was worried about the Black cuts at O18 and Q18, which is why I didn't play at N17.

YJ - correct.];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[qa]TR[sb]C[Fedya: I was very concerned with ensuring I'd get two eyes here in the corner.

YJ - this corner is more or less secure. b needs 2 or 3 consecutive moves without w responding to kill it. But if you have to play here, T18 is a better choice.]
;B[bq];W[br]TR[ne][qf]SQ[gh]C[YJ - this is endgame move, though a big end game move. So it is not appropriate at this point of the game. White's marked stones are not quite dead yet, plus the jump at G12 are all bigger moves.]
;B[gh]C[YJ - finally b closes the gaping hole.];W[qh]C[Fedya: I felt I was so far behind that the only chance I had to win was to make a live group with the R14 and O15 stones.  I thought I did this by achieving a seki, but it turns out the position was dead all along and I believe I played for dozens of moves too long.

YJ - even if the grp makes 2 eyes, I suspect it is not enough to turn the tide.]
;B[og]
(;W[ri]C[YJ - there is a fairly standard play in these situations. see variations.]
;B[rj];W[sj];B[sk];W[si];B[qi];W[rh]TR[rg]C[YJ - S13 is better]
;B[rl];W[pr];B[pq];W[qq];B[or];W[qr];B[pl];W[rm];B[lq]
(;W[ph]TR[oh][pg]C[Fedya: I think this might have been better-placed elsewhere.  S14 looks like the least bad move, although in any case I don't know if it's possible to get two eyes.

Part of the reason I picked this is that I was hoping I could surround the P13 stone, or at least threaten it enough to make two eyes elsewhere.

YJ - S14 is not good. better alternatives marked];B[oh]
(;W[pg]C[Fedya: Maybe I should have played T13 here -- but I don't think it makes much difference because I've already given up the entire center.

YJ - yes, the game is as good as over by now.];B[sg];W[pi]C[Fedya: Maybe S14 would have been better here, although again, I don't think I'd get two eyes.]

;B[oj];W[se]C[Fedya: I thought I had a seki here.  However, Black can kill by playing at T14 and T12.

YJ - yep, the 'T' shape.];B[mc];W[mb];B[lb];W[pb]C[YJ - better at T18.]

;B[mi];W[mj];B[li];W[mf];B[kf];W[lg];B[kg]
(;W[lh]C[Fedya: This is the losing move.  At least, it's the move which costs me the group.  I should have played at O13 here, which is a double atari.  At least, it's the move which costs me my group.  According to the variation, Black can seal me off, in which case, I lose by 40 instead of 120.  Big deal.

YJ -yes.];B[mh];W[kh];B[lj];W[ji]C[Fedya: Would it have been possible for me to get a second eye in the center if I had played something else like J12?

The problem I had from here on out is that I thought I had a seki on the right, so I was only trying to play reducing moves.

YJ - not quite possible to get another eye in the centre because b has not much weaknesses in its walls to exploit. w needs at least 3 consecutive moves to make another eye which b will not allow of course.]
