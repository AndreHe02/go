hardly a priority at this time.  You should play a shimari like a or b.]

Scud 16k*: I don't think this is a bad move.  The mistake is a couple
moves later, see the variation.];W[gp];B[go];W[ho];B[eq]L[hq]C[This is the  mistaken move.  You should instead play at a.  Descending from the 4th or 3rd line to the 3rd or 2nd line in response
to a cut like this is a very important pattern you should recognize. It
can be considered a tesuji.];W[hq];B[qo];W[po];B[pn];W[on];B[qp];W[qq];B

C[At this point I would say white  is somewhat ahead, but black
still has a chance.  The center is the big concern.  Big points are,
a: threating to connect and take away a lot of the center;
b: connecting and threatening to reduce the right side territory;
c: gote, but saves about 12 points on the left side;
d,e,f or g: threatens to make life on the lower side;
h: encroaches on the center;
i: threatens to connect to either nearby group; dangerous because
neither group is yet safe.];B[jg];W[hf];B[hh]L[lh]C[This move doesn't  threaten anything, and is a loose connection.
 I would prefer a.];W[gh];B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[qj];B[nj];W[pi];B[oj]C[You  don't need to make this move; 1 point is not worth much,
the connection at a would be worth much more.];W[sn]
(;B[ol]L[lh][om]C[This is a timid move.  Since a makes a connection (see the
variation), you don't need to connect.  If you do decide to connect, b
is better since it also threatens.];W[so];B[rk]C[Should I have played  toward center instead? and if so, where?

Scud 16k*: I prefer a, but all of the moves mentioned several moves
previously are still prospects.  (Yes, you should have played toward the  center.)]
;W[rj];B[rl]L[rm]C[If you played at a instead, you would have had  an eye down
here, because of the threat.];W[lh];B[kh];W[ep];B[dp];W[dq];B[dr];W[cq]
;B[cr]L[bq]C[You would be better off with a, never giving white an extra  liberty.]
;W[bq];B[br];W[dn]L[cn]C[I believe a works (see variation).]
(;B[do];W[dl];B[cn]L[cm]C[You should play a instead.];W[cm];B[bm];W[dm]

(;B[bo]C[You don't have to fix this side; see previous variation.];W[ck]
;B[bl]L[cj][ch]C[I think a works better, letting the one stone be killed, and
then connecting with b.];W[cj];B[ci]C[This move doesn't work];W[di];B[en]
C[This move is useless for your cause.  If you want to reduce
liberties on white's group, you should play at a instead; this move is
only good toward the end of a shortage of liberties fight, since it
neither connects nor takes territory nor threatens to separate white or
take away white's territory.  Wasted moves like this destroy a game.];W
[hm];B[hn]C[This is a good move.];W[io]L[ip][er]C[White should have played  at a, threatening b and gaining sente.]
;B[ng]L[me][in][jj]C[The better  move is a, or a follow up of your previous move with
b, or my a connection attempt at c.];W[og]L[mg]C[White could have played at a.]
;B[of]L[mg]C[White can still respond at a; see variation.]
(;W[pf];B[mg];W[oe]L[nf]C[White should instead respond at a.];B[oh]C
[This move doesn't seem to accomplish anything; you were perhaps
hoping for white to make a mistake?
Unless there's a good chance of such a mistake, it is better to save
moves like this as ko threats.];W[oi];B[me]C[Good move.];W[in];B[ch]L[jl]
[nn][kq][lp][mq][oq][mo][hj][kd][kb][ed][jd][rd]
[gq]C[This move is not really a forcing move, even though white
responded.  I would prefer the marked moves as worth more points.];W[ej]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[ai];W[rd];B[rc];W[hi]L[jj]C[I think a would have been appropriate at this  time, giving up
the threatened stone in exchange for a connection (see variation).]
(;B[ih];W[jj];B[ki]C[What would have been the proper response here?

Scud 16k*: I think this is a decent response.  You are in a bad situation  here.]

(;W[mm]L[li]C[White had a good chance to play a here and kill the entire
black group; since white's ahead, I suppose white didn't think it worth the  risk.]
;B[ll];W[km];B[lm];W[ln];B[kl];W[jm];B[jl];W[il];B[kj];W[jk]L[kk][lk]
M[lj][li]C[Since you have the bamboo joint (marked) you don't need to
respond to this.  If white a, then black b.  So an invasion on the
lower side is possible, and probably your best hope of salvaging the game.]

(;B[kk];W[gn];B[ml];W[mn];B[nm];W[fn]C[Though this  looks dangerous, I believe it can be ignored; see
variation.  Recognizing when your opponent has made a move which is
only apparently sente can be a big help in a game.]
