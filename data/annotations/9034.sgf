C[forfun (hereafter ff) - First of all thanks for providing an interesting game to analyze. I think that White showed a good feeling for the overall balance in the early going. However, after Black played on tengen, White did not formulate a really effective plan. Luckily for White, the invasion of Black's right-side position turned into a great success that turned the game back in White's favor. From there White protected the lead through to the end. Let's see the details behind all this...]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[de];W[cg];B[fd]C[this move is quite rare... is it good here ???
(LL)

ff - It is not "bad". It essentially guarantees that Black will make an outward-facing position. Perhaps it shows a little lack of flexibility on Black's part. White can not expect to have some special play that will "punish" Black. White responds calmly and well.]
;W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[db];B[df];W[cf];B[oc]TR[kd][qj][cn]
[nq]C[what is the correct direction ???
(LL)

ff - It is more a matter of taste than some absolute answer. Since Black has connected at F16, those stones are strong. In some similar positions where Black plays elsewhere instead of connecting, White plays into the top in order to attack the Black upper left. That seems more difficult here. 

The top is not interesting since there are no weak stones, the upper left is open at E18, and Black's P17 is low. 

Playing C6 would be unbalanced and too conservative here because C13 is very strong, but low. The left side is not interesting.

So the question is more or less, appoach the lower right at O3 or invade the right side at R10? Approaching at O3 means building up White's framework instead of reducing Black's. I think that approaching O3 is more positive and interesting in this position.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[oq]C[ff - An odd choice since all Black's stones up to now point to the center/upper right side.]
;W[no];B[op]LB[mo:A][nr:B]
(;W[mo]C[I choose a hight move to fight against black'is influence on the right side.
(LL)

ff - This is the right idea here.];B[mq];W[lq];B[nr]
(;W[mr]C[ff - It is a question whether White should play this right now. The typical alternative would be to play the knight's move into the right side. See the variation.]
;B[pn]LB[nm:B][fq:A]
(;W[fq];B[jj]LB[jd:B][qi:A]C[black wants to play a global game : I am weak at such situations... where is the bigger move to play, now ???
(LL)

ff - All early plays around K10 are risky because the opponent immediately has a clear target. The point is not to capture K10 but rather to make it look inefficient. In this situation, playing into the top looks more risky than the right side. The White stones at N5 are strong and close by.]
(;W[qi]C[it's my choice, but I do not know if it is good !?
(LL)

ff - I agree on the direction, maybe not on the actual play. See the variations...]
(;B[qk]
(;W[qf]C[ff - White plays very close to Black's strong stones. I think White would have been in more difficulty here if Black had reacted differently. Perhaps White should have played out first and only settled the stones later. See the variations.]
(;B[jd]C[ff - This is a mistake in direction in my opinion. Black misses the chance to press White down on the right side...]
(;W[of];B[ne]LB[nf:B][oh:A]
(;W[oh]C[ff - This seems too conservative. White has not come out well here. The White group threatens little. In particular, the four stones that White has played do nothing to cut off K10 and have little future potential. 

There were many alternatives here, essentially all more energetic than this. In my opinion, this quiet move is perhaps the one that White should regret the most in this game.]
;B[cm]TR[cj][dm][dn][en][co]C[how should I answer this move ???
(LL)

ff - Unusual choice by Black. But White does have a problem. We should always be looking for dual-purpose moves. In this case the obvious second target would be the stone on K10. However, it is not at all weak.]
(;W[dm];B[cn];W[dn];B[bp];W[cq]

;W[ea];B[fa];W[da];B[gb]TR[lg][eh][jh][cj][jl]C[here too, I have a problem finding the good direction :-(
(LL)

ff - See comments in the variations. I think I would pick K8 here.]
(;W[lg]C[ff - This move is conservative. It does not really threaten the top because the top is too strong. At the same time it is not really threaening K10. I think K8 was a more reasonable choice.]
(;B[mg]C[ff - Black plays to protect the top, but the top is stronger than the center. This seems like a mistake in direction by Black.]

(;W[cj]C[ff - The simple play at C8 is more severe I think.]
;B[ck];W[dj];B[dk]
(;W[eh]C[ff - There is no comment included on this play so it is difficult to understand what White was thinking. Both the general direction and the shape of this play are strange.

(LL)

ff - Black has lost some in the last few moves. But this is partly offset by Black's structure in the center. White has become strong in sente with S15 etc. Invading looks interesting now. The only alternative would be trying to play against the center, but that does not look easy.]
