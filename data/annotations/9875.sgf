C[I'm having trouble moving up a rank, and I presume the cause is not knowing how to handle contact plays.  I haven't been able to review contact plays on josekipedia or at my internet go school which doesn't have an index.  In this game my opponent used a lot of contact plays that I didn't know how to handle.


-> 
Hi, I'll do my best to review! I'll be commenting on the game as a whole, and I'll try to comment on the contact plays as well.

FYI: I'm about 3kyu at the time of this review.];B[pd]C[

C[As I understand it, whites joseki choice should be a little weak here because it leaves aji in the corner, but now white plays an attachment.]
;W[kp]TR[jq]C[I run out to control the center.

I'm curious why you needed to run out to the center? This give white another sente move. I would drop down, trying to take sente.]

(;B[jo];W[ko]TR[nq]C[bad move for white. Now he is very heavy, and open to attack. Your stones are solid on the left so you can ignore those ones. Your stone on the bottom right is weak now. You can play at the marked location to support your stone and attack white at the same time.]
;B[jn];W[kq]TR[jq][nq]C[It appears from the game that white is setting up for another attachment.  How do I handle this situation?

Well, you let yourself get into this position by allowing white to keep sente, and passively responding to white's moves. You should have taken control earlier. But if I were to respond here, your choices are as marked.]

In general you place a stone n+1 spaces away from an n-stone wall. The wall is 4 stones, so you placed the stone 5 places away, which is correct.]
;W[nc];B[lc]LB[pj:A]C[since I had a stone at A I went with the pincer.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[mc];W[md]C[non joseki move without any obvious reason, but I wasn't sure how to take advantage. So I tried a probe move thats supposed to fit with my joseki.  Some strategy advice covering the next few moves would help.


You dont need to constantly think "punish punish punish". If white played a bad move, secure your group first. If white fixes his bad move, you now have sente. If white does not fix his bad move, you can come back later and punish.]

(;B[cf]C[Is this probe move acceptable here?  White gets to play her apparent favorite joseki with an attack on the black group.



You have to settle your group on the top before playing away.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[cj]TR[lc][mc][kd]C[should I have defended blacks marked stones instead?


Yes!];W[ck]TR[lc][mc][kd]C[another side attachment play.  This time it looks like white intends to get the maximum amount of the space between our side groups in sente.  what joseki's can I choose between?  What are they called?  Where can I look them up?  Oh and did white miss an opportunity to attack the marked group?]
;B[dj]C[running out to control the center again :)


Why do you want to "control the center"? The center looks un-interesting at this point in this game. This is a good move because it makes the C9 stone look weak.]
;W[dk];B[ej]C[An un-necessary move. What's the purpose? I can't see one. If you want to move quickly into the center, then E10 is better.]
;W[pc]C[technically an attachment.  What is my best line of play here and why?

I suppose I would play R16 here to defend your stone. You have two weak groups here, thanks to you ignoring the battle on top.]
;B[qc];W[pb]
(;B[qd];W[od];B[pg];W[kc]C[is there a common line of play from here or did black wait to long to come back?


You did fine dealing with this. THe problem was, this situation should not have come up in the first place.]
;B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[mb]
(;B[je]C[This is too slow. The L16 stone would only be important if M16 was in trouble....but it's not. You should play more lightly when invading.]

Black's stones all look safe. White's top left looks weak, so I would take advantage with something in one of the marked areas.]

(;B[ok];W[oj]C[Crosscuts are good for sacrifice. You can readup more here:

(;B[pl];W[nk];B[qk]LB[pm:A]C[#$@$#@$@ giving white the ponuki cannot be the best line.  However this gives me an opportunity to ask how do you use a ponnuki once you have one?  Did the atari threat at A make this a particularly nasty ponnuki?


As with nearly all your questions, there is not answer to "how do you use a ponnuki". Everything depends on the situation on the board.]

;B[fe];W[hh];B[kg];W[gg];B[gi];W[ff];B[hi];W[og]C[The final move I am interested in getting help with.  It seems white is aiming at getting thickness by attacking on the outside.  This looks like an exchange sequence revealing hidden structure.  Any comments and further advice on handling attachments would be appreciated however.


I'm not sure you understand the concept of thickness very well...think of it as safety, or lack of aji, or strength. It is important early in the game when you are dealing with a battle of "potential".  This late in the game we are not talking about potential anymore, but reality, and concrete outcomes.

This is called a leaning attack:

http://senseis.xmp.net/?Leaning

White hopes to get a move here in sente, and then can attack the K14 group. This, in effect, means white got to attack K14 with two moves. White didnt do this very well though....]

[an][bn][hn][in][rn]C[OK, here are the major comments I would suggest to you for improvement:


First of all, learn about "The list":

http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shygost#toc2

When deciding on a move, ask yourself 3 questions, IN ORDER:
1.) Are my groups safe? If not, fix them.
2.) Are my opponents groups safe? If not, attack them
3.) Otherwise, play the big move.

A good book to understand attacking and defending moves better is called "Attack and Defense" and is probably the book that improved my strength the most in go, around your rank.


Second, as you suggested, your strategy to deal with attachments is indicative of a larger problem. Every time your opponent attaches, you seem to hane for the most part. You should understand that the hane is useful for sacrifice and sabaki but generally not for strengthening your own stones (since you want general principles). This is not always the case, but its a useful idea. The variations around move 84  are good for showing how increasing your own strength can attack your opponent indirectly. I would try to understand that situation. You want to remain strong while leaving your opponent with weaknesses. Allowing your opponent to capture a stone and get a ponnuki is too good for them.

Finally, there are no "best moves" for attachments in general. They tend to be very complex and difficult situations. It's important to understand when you are willing to sacrifice and when you need to be strong. Generally, the invader wants to sacrifice and make life, while the defender should try to remain strong and solid. Your moves around the F13 region had this issue as well. You should have played stronger, more solid moves to defend, if you want to keep things from getting complicated and out of control.]
