Should be at K18. When you play the San Ren Sei, you are trying to
make a big moyo.  M17 allows white to reduce your moyo easily. Let
white live with a few points on the side, while you get the upper
right corner and a nice position in the upper left.];W[lb];B[kc];W[jb];B
[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[mc];B[jc]C[
Bad shape. This move makes an empty triangle, and doesn't really
accomplish anything. The three black stones in the upper center are
already connected. It would be better to take a big point elsewhere,
like D10. You have the potential to make thickness across the top, and
D10 will work well with it. It also reduces the value of the lower
left corner for your opponent.];W[hc];B[hd];W[gc];B[gd];W[ic];B[id];W[dj]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[gb];W[hb];B[eb];W[ga];B[ec];W[cf]C[
By not playing D10 earlier, you have built thickness across the top,
but it doesn't work because of the white stones at D10 and C14 To
catch up, you will have to find some way to use that thick position.];B
[ce]C[
This only makes white stronger. White as approached close to your
thick position.  Rather than trying to make territory, attack white by
playing C12.  C15 gets you maybe 12 points of territory, but white
gets almost that much after D14. By invading, you can get a little in
the corner, while reducing white's territory rather than increasing it.]
;W[df];B[nf]C[
I don't understand this move. What were you trying to accomplish? The
white stones on the top are alive, and there are plenty of big points
to play.  F3 might be interesting. If white pincers, you can play C3,
and if white responds in the corner, you can extend to J3 and kill any
potential territory on the bottom. There are several other
possiblilities, too. White has a moyo, but very little actual
territory. You have solid territory. It might be best to just play a
straight territorial game. O14 may be the losing move.];W[jq]C[Now white has a Big moyo.]
;B[ql]C[
When your opponent's moyo is bigger than yours, play to reduce it. If
yours is bigger play to make it bigger. His moyo is bigger than yours
right now. If white gets E4 you the game will be very difficult for you.]
;W[op]C[Wrong side. This lets you play in the middle of the moyo at E4.]
;B[ep]C[Good. This is your last chance to invade before the moyo becomes territory.]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[gp];W[cn];B[iq]C[
H3 is better. J3 just forces white white to make the K3 stone
stronger. F7 might be even better than H3. It escapes into the center,
and white almost has to defend at D8. Then maybe you can invade at N3.
After F7/D8, white has about 40 points on the left, about 15 on the
bottom right, and maybe 10 on the top, for a ltotal of about 65. You
have about 20 in the upper right, and about 12 in the upper left, and
a couple of points on the bottom side, totaling maybe 35, so you are
30 points behind. If you invade at N3, maybe you can push the K3 stone
towards your thickness on the top and make some territory on the right
side while attacking it, or else reduce white's bottom left territory.
You are behind on points, so you need to do something.];W[jp];B[ip];W[jo]
C[Now the bottom right is pretty much white territory, while all
you got was life on the bottom.];B[gm]C[Too late. The bottom group is pretty secure, so no need to run
into the center now. Better to invade on the left side, maybe at C8.
If you think it is important to extend into the center here, F7 is
better shape. It works well with the stones around F4.];W[gr];B[fr];W[ir]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[hr];W[js];B[gs];W[io];B[hp];W[er];B[do]C[This looks slow. S6 is a big point, and you may want to  play
B5 as a forcing move  later, if you get to invade at C8. Forcing now
removes that potential and doesn't really get you anything.];W[co];B[fj]
;W[dl];B[em]C[Too slow. It doesn't get you anything, and isn't forcing. You
need to be making territory somewhere. O7 or S6 look big. Now you can
see why F7 was better shape before.];W[fo];B[mo];W[mq];B[po];W[oo];B[on]
;W[pp];B[pn];W[dn];B[eo]C[
Better to sacrifice the stones at D5 and E4. It is only 4 point and
white is strong there anyway Play G5 to connect to the G7 stone or
just take the G2 stone and make life. You already made a profit the
right side. The empty triangle is bad shape.];W[en];B[fn];W[gn];B[go];W
[fm];B[hn];W[fn];B[ho];W[fp];B[gl];W[jm];B[im];W[jl];B[kn];W[jn];B[ik]C
[
These stones are already alive by just taking G2. It would be better
to make territory on the right side with N7 or S6 or something on the
right side.];W[il];B[hl];W[jk];B[ij];W[nn];B[jj]C[
O7 would be better. Your main territory is on the right side. Because
of the stone at D14, the center is small. You can only make a few
points there.];W[nm]C[
After this move, you don't have much chance. White has 45 in the lower
right, about 45 on the left and 10 on the top, for about 100 points.
You have about 15 in the upper left, maybe 40 on the right, so you
need to get about 45-50 in the middle, and that isn't going to be possible.]
