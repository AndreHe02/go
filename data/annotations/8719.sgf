C[Dear reviewer, I am Oceandrop (10k on KGS)

I try to add questions along the way, but I would wish to hear some comments about the opening because I feel often very unsecure where to play, especially after move/turn 26, although I did win this game with 14,5 points, I feel like that a review from a better player who could tell me my greatest mistakes would help me very to improve my play. Also the fight which arrises with turn 114 interest me much, could white have killed my group? (Sorry for my not so good English).

Maybe you could also comment about some of whites greatest mistakes, because I feel a bit like I just won because he made some mistakes, not because I played especially better than him.

Ps: I gave my opponent some time, because I hate it myself to lose by time and wasn't sure who was winning (bad at counting..) and I hate it even more to win by time, when I afterwards see that I would have without his time dead losed, because it just don't feel right I find... so because I was unsecure who was winning, I gave him some extra time. (Uhm sounds terrible my english, I'm sorry).

Review:

Hi, my name is Rainer (5k). I did the review for this game. I hope my comments (marked R:) will help you in you future games!

Have fun!];B[qd];W[pq];B[dd];W[cp];B[cj]CR[jc][kc][po][qo][ep]
[eq]C[R: I would prefer playing at one of the 3-4 stones. Or perhaps the Chinese Opening.]
;W[fc]
(;B[ec]LB[df:A]C[R: A more conservative play at A would be better IMHO. Touching a stone only makes it stronger.]
;W[fd];B[dg];W[jd]CR[cc]TR[fc]C[OD: Could white still invade at C17?

(He invaded in turn 98 and survived, but maybe I could have killed him?) Maybe you can look later at it :-)

R: Yes, invasion is possible.]N[Can white still invade at C17?]
;B[nc]CR[po][qo][ep][eq]C[R: That's not really a threat to the white stones. For balance a play around the marked positions would be better, I think.]
;W[qn]CR[jp]C[R: The shimari threatens a play around the marked position.]
;B[eq]CR[jp]C[OD: Already a mistake to play here? Maybe I should have better played from the other site, or at E4? Because of Whites Shimari on the right side?

R: Not a mistake, but there might be better spots. Most of the times it is good to play where the opponent wants to play. In this case it would be somewhere around K4 (marked). Your move also invites White to pincer you, strenghtening the right side in the process.]
N[Mistake?];W[gq];B[eo];W[go]C[R: White wants to increase pressure on Black, building influence on the lower right side.]
;B[cn];W[dr];B[bq]CR[kc][pi][pj][qj][hp][lq]C[R: Difficult, there are many variations possible. A play at the other marked points might be more profitable.]
(;W[cq];B[bp];W[br];B[bo];W[do];B[dn];W[en]
(;B[em]CR[fn]C[OD: Think it was best to play here, because of defending my "territory", instead of playing F6, or elsewhere, but maybe you have better suggesstions?

R: Well, this way you lose the stones and further strengthen Whites position on the lower side. Instead of playing B3 in move 19 you should have played elsewhere if you wanted to secure territory. In this situation I would have played F6 to keep White under pressure.]
;W[fn]LB[fm:A]
(;B[hp]LB[lp:A]C[OD: Thought I had to do something about this.. but did not know exactly what, so if you could say something about the invasion/fight what now arises that would be great, maybe white could have chase me more than he did and win the game? Or maybe I could have done better? Maybe White should not have answered the peep, but play somewhere around M4?

Ps: Maybe I should have just played F7? Because I think white didnt have to answer my peep?

R: See A for a possible variation, if White doesn't answer the peep. F7 would be a possibility (see A on move 28), both sides gaining possible territory.]
N[What to do?]
(;W[gp];B[lp];W[jp];B[jo];W[io];B[jn];W[ip];B[qi]C[R: Important move.]
;W[qk];B[pg]CR[oi]C[R: Just jumping to the marked position is better.]
;W[hl];B[fm]TR[jn][jo][lp]C[R: I would be more important to strengthen the marked stones.]
;W[gm];B[fk];W[nl]TR[jn][jo][lp]C[R: Now the "breathing space" for the marked stones gets a lot smaller.]
;B[jl];W[hj];B[ln]CR[mm][mn]C[OD: Table shape yaay.. but maybe it wasn't good here, or there were better/bigger moves? I am always a unsure were to play in this stage of the game mh but thought the table would be good?

R: Saving your stones is most important. Playing one space further might be better.]

;W[oo];B[mh];W[lj]C[OD: After this I did not know where to play, so I played the next move at L18 just to steal some territory and think/thought (um english :')) that my group was alive so I could tenuki(?), but maybe F13 would have been better, or L17? I just feel kind of lost in this stage of the game : / Hope you can give me some insight, or maybe I should have not played L18, but someplace else on the board?

R: See next move.]N[Tenuki? Mistake?];B[kb]LB[eb:B][gi:A]C[R: I would prefer A or B. With A gaining territory, or with B closing the corner and threatening to slide unter White.]
;W[fg]C[OD: Maybe I should have played here, instead of L18?
