C[P: Im not sure of when it´s time to attack or to make territory, because I sometimes attack and at last I dont kill, my oponent scape and end making more territory then I

HI!

My Name is David Liu and I have been studying Go for  almost 2 years now. I am about 1K and you can find me on KGS under milkman. =)
I usually take time to review games with my opponent, especially if was a handicap game, and I am confident in my ability to atleast bring some insight to the board.
Hope you find this review helpful.];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[qp]

(;B[mp]TR[np]C[Reviewer: This move here can be considered a subtle disadvantage to black. Compare the result of this joseki against if black had played at the triangle instead.]
(;W[pn]C[Reviewer: This move can easily be punished, as it is way too ambitious. There is a huge weakness around R5 which can be avoided by White playing at R6 instead of Q6]
;B[iq]
(;W[kq]C[Reviewer: K4 would capture the stone in this position.]
(;B[ko]C[P: Im not sure about this move. I know that is bad shape with J3, but I think he will scape and I will be attacking him and makin territory
Reviewer: This would be the case with most invasion, but not if you can kill L3 outright.]
;W[jp]
(;B[ip]TR[in][gp]C[P: what about g4?

Reviewer: This is bad style, since it forces white out at K5. If you want to make territory along the bottom side, you should play at J6 instead. See continuation for explanation.]
;W[jo]
(;B[hn]C[P: I think H6 is very big and if I attack  from the other side, I would not make many territory. H6 is an attack anyway,  I know that he will end attacking N4 but I think he will not kill nor make a lot of territory

Reviewer: H6 would be big if D4 wasn't so close. You seem a bit overconcetrated. The general rule is the space to extend would be wall height +1
In this case, your wall is 4 stones high, and D4 is only 4 stones away. Also, the territory you're making can easily be destroyed with a 3-3 invasion.]
;W[kn];B[nn]C[P. Scape rather that save L5

Reviewer: Good choice];W[lq];B[mq]TR[mr]C[P: Maybe it was better to assure my scape, but I wanted to preserve the posibility of attack M3

Reviewer: Good thinking here, except the standard shape against m3 would be n2]
;W[lo];B[on]TR[qo]SQ[nl]C[Reviewer:  This move unnecessarily strengthens the white right side. Before this move, you have a lot of aji to attack with around R5, but now its mostly gone after white responds. If you want to secure your group, you should just play O8 instead]
;W[pm];B[lp]C[Reviewer: Aji Keshi (unnecessarily removing your threats)]
;W[kp];B[nl];W[ok];B[jl]LB[jm:A][hn:B][ip:C]C[P: Trying to get influence,, because I think its dificult for him to capture o3

Reviewer: This move seems kind of random, since it forms a weird shape with H6. A more proper shape would be K7 (the big bulge formed by A B C)]
;W[kl];B[lm]C[Reviewer: again, unnecessarily removing aji.]
;W[km]
(;B[mk]TR[mj]C[Reviewer: With M7 in place, you can actually jump out to N10]
;W[jk];B[hl];W[il];B[im];W[jm];B[lk]C[Reviewer: This move was not needed at all. You should have just played at H9]
;W[hk]C[Reviewer: This was probably the winning move for white (if he plays properly from now on)]
;B[gl];W[gk];B[fl];W[ll]TR[mh]SQ[lh]C[Reviewer: You should instead play around M12 or N12.]
;B[mm];W[mo]C[Reviewer: White is just getting rid of his potential ko threats here. Absolutely unneeded.]
;B[no];W[lr];B[qk];W[ol];B[pi]C[Reviewer: This move is a bit ambitions, since white can attack while attacking the N9 group. You should just play low at R11 or R12]
;W[nk];B[ml];W[ni];B[li];W[ng];B[pg];W[nr];B[mh];W[nh];B[de]
TR[jh]SQ[lf]C[P: Again the same way of thinking. I think its difficult for him to kill so I get territory

Reviewer: your group is by no means secure. Should play around K12 or M14. Approaching here just allows white more options to play a joseki which allows him to better attack your lone group]

Reviewer: The game was played well by both players despite some mistakes on both sides. I think there is still a move left at O18 for 1 point (this would be sente for black, actually). But if you take away all the unneeded moves white played and all of the failed attempts at causing trouble, you would have won by only 1.5 points
On the other hand, if you played better endgame, you would have won by more than 10 points or so...

You should watch out about overly-cautious moves. You have played many unnecessary moves in this game, and that probably costed you a lot of points.]
