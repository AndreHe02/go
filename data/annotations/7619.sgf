AB[pd][dp]PL[W];W[pp];B[dd]C[[Actorios\] I suppose this is preferable to a komoku as it is more balanced.

Aprairie: Either move is fine, your preference is what matters here.]
;W[df];B[fc];W[cd];B[cc];W[ce];B[jd];W[cn];B[fp];W[eo]C[Aprairie: This move is bad, it solidifies black, and takes away any aji (late game potential) that white has in the corner later.  Also, now white cannot take the 3-3 invasion.  Black is very happy with this result.]
;B[ep]C[[Actorios\] Was E5 a good move for white ?];W[dj];B[qn]
;W[qo]C[[Vicvain\] A pincer maybe ? To keep black's moyo under control...

Aprairie: R5 here is a bad move, it gives black a perfect extension.  This type of move should only be played in certain circumstances, a few examples are when white has a stone alerady at Q10, or black has a stone at r9, to prevent an efficient extension for black.]
;B[pn];W[np];B[pj]C[Aprairie: And here black takes the correct perfect extension, note that black still has aji in the corner  (potential).  He can invade at R3]
;W[qc]C[[Vicvain\] I didn't want black to close the corner : the black's moyo at the top and the right would be too big with no easy access for white.

Aprairie: Personally I think this is bad for white.  White here is letting black have so much influence that he will be easily able to take most of the board]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]C[[Actorios\] Was it worth making this Double Hane?

Aprairie: I prefer the normal sequence for lots of influence here.  Then if black can take some point around the center he can start building a gigantic moyo.]
;W[nc]C[[Vicvain\] what about white s16 ?];B[od];W[mb];B[pb]
;W[na];B[qb];W[me]
(;B[lc]C[Aprairie: I think this move is best at p14, solves a lot of problems for you later, including the threat of the R17 stones escaping, and solidifies right side territory.]
;W[nd];B[jp]C[Aprairie: I would still put a stone at P14 here, alternativelly, if I were to place a stone in the K4 area, I would play lower, at L3 or M3, threatening to take away even more of whites corner.]
;W[oe];B[rc]C[Aprairie: now white is able to move into black's territory, which is why P14 was important earlier]
;W[rn];B[rm];W[ro];B[ql]C[Aprairie: While this move is generally very good, I would not place R8 now, instead moving at Q14.  This would keep pressure on White's group, and allow you to solidify your territory]
;W[qh]
(;B[oh]C[[Actorios\] I didn't want to let black run away into the center, therefore I played this capping move. Was it the most appropriate?

Aprairie: I'm taking this question to mean you didn't want white to run into the center.  I see no danger of white running into the center as black has little potential there now.  Let white run, and profit while he is running.  I prefer a move at Q14, to try to split white's stone from the rest of the group, and keep him running, see variation.]
;W[pf];B[pg]C[[Actorios\] Was this move and the following sequence, the most appropriate way to cut?

Aprairie: this is fine, but as I said earlier, there was an easier way to split white]
;W[qf];B[qg];W[rg];B[nf];W[mf]C[[Actorios\] This resistance was felt as the turning point of the game. White should have answered at O15.

Aprairie: Yes this move seems fine for white at first, but you found the killing move, it fails, well done.  White should simply connect and stay strong at O15]
;B[of];W[nh];B[oi];W[ne];B[pe];W[og];B[ng];W[mg];B[og];W[hc]
C[Aprairie: Since white is now behind, this move is important to stir the game up and try to cause chaos.]

(;B[fo]C[[Actorios\] Was this move efficient ?

Aprairie: I think you have better moves, see variation.];W[bp]
;B[cq];W[en];B[gm];W[lq]C[[Actorios\] Seems like a big move which both of us left aside in the game.]
;B[kq];W[lp];B[ln]C[[Actorios\] I played this move because I felt it had two purposes: extend both territories at the bottom-left and and right side. Was it a valid placement?

Aprairie: Yes it seems fine];W[ko]
(;B[mo]C[Aprairie: This move seems unnecessary, take a cut at top as in variation]
;W[li];B[ni];W[lk];B[mh];W[lh];B[mj];W[lj];B[mk];W[gn]C[Aprairie: This move is bad, solidifies black]
;B[fn];W[em];B[hn];W[jo];B[io]TR[gm][hn][jp][kq]C[[Actorios\] Is such a line of stones really efficient? What is the best way for white to face it?

Aprairie: This is efficient given the way white plays.  The stone set itself is not all that efficient, you should not strive to make this shape.  In this case it is fine.]
;W[gg];B[gh];W[gf];B[kg];W[kf];B[jg];W[lg];B[bq]C[Aprairie: Very big move]
;W[co];B[bb]C[Aprairie: Also big];W[mm];B[lm];W[fl];B[no]C[[Actorios\] I felt there was a threat on the territory at the right side with O5 played by white. Therefore I didn't answer to this move at F8.

Aprairie: F8 wasn't worth responding to, this is fine since you are ahead, other good moves include L2 and B16.]
;W[aq];B[ar];W[ap];B[bs];W[kr];B[jr];W[in];B[ip]C[[Actorios\] Was this an efficient defense against white's pressure on the group?

Aprairie This is fine, it gets rid of a bunch of your cutting points.]

;W[ho];B[go];W[hm];B[hp]
(;W[hi]C[[Actorios\] I was surprised that white didn't defend against the double-atari at J7.

Aprairie: It isn't worth too many points, so its not a huge deal, however, this move is better placed at g11. see variation]
;B[hh];W[gl]C[[Actorios\] I felt there was a threat on the territory at the right side with O5 played by white. Therefore I didn't answer to this move at F8.]
;B[im];W[il];B[hl];W[hk]
(;B[hm]C[[Actorios\] Connect or not connect?

Aprairie: Do not connect, 1 point ko, see variation];W[fh]C[Aprairie: This move was also very big]
;B[gi];W[fi];B[ii];W[ij];B[ji];W[jj];B[jn];W[ll];B[ml];W[jl]
;B[lo];W[kp];B[gc]C[[Actorios\] I felt uneasy with that stone... I guess white could have reduced from this weakness.

Aprairie: This stone wasn't a huge deal but I don't blame you getting uneasy about it, note you have a forcing move at J19]

;W[tt];B[tt]C[Aprairie: Good game overall.

Important things to remember are to stop making moves that destroy your aji.  Your aji is worth a lot to you later, so don't unnecessarily solidify your opponent gaining nothing in exchange.

Also, you both seem to undervalue cutting.  Try to cut your opponent more often, particularly when you can cut two weak groups and chase them both for profit.

Good luck in all of your games, if you have any questions or I did not resolve something, please send me a message on KGS.]
