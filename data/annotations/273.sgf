 Scud 15k*: bow
Ok, This is Richard Rumley here.  I should probably insert some sort of  disclaimer here.  First of all, this is my first time using mgt for DOS, and  I don't know how to do variations.  I tried my best :).  Second of all, this  is my first time commenting somebody else's game, so its a little weird.   (see next move for more)]

TM[900]RE[W+6.5]US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[0.5];B[pd]C[Commenting somebody else's game is tough, I  don't want to offend anyone, yet I want to be truthful in my opinion.  Some  of my opinions my not be 100% correct compared to a stronger player.  So, in  front of all my comments, please place "I think that..."  ;-)
Thanks for the opportunity, if you like my comments, let me know.  If they  were too much or not enough, let me know too.]
;W[dc]C[Comments by Richard  Rumley
rumley@sei.com];B[pp];W[dq];B[pj]C[Seems like white stones are not working  together well, while the san-ren-sei works nicely.  Perhaps one of the W  stones should be on the 4,4 point?]
;W[nc]M[ce]C[Shimari before kakari?  So  maybe
C15 would be better?];B[nd]M[pj]C[I like this move, esp with Q10];W[qc]
;B[pc]L[qd]M[pj]C[Q17 should be at R16.  This works with the san-ren-sei better.   Now Q10 looks lonley.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]L[qf]C[I think  this is too risky.  Better to play at R14.  This lets White crawl on the  second line, which is good for Black]
;W[pe];B[qf];W[pb];B[od]C[Empty triangles are usually bad.  Try P16 at P15 instead.  Just watch out  for a snapback if W P18]
;W[ob];B[rd]L[of][mc]C[This move is too small, at this stage  of the game.  W is alive, so play somewhere else.  P14 is a big move, as is  N17]
;W[rc];B[se];W[md]C[Because of S16, W gets sente.
W is now increasing his framework on the top];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[qq]C[Too  early for a 3,3 invasion.  Keep pushing at L15 is a good move.
Because of this invastion, B should geet excellent moyo on Rt side.];B[qp]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[oi]M[pe]C[Nice spot for moyo  Reduction.
Lots of Aji with Q15 stone!];B[mi]L[oj][ni][qh]C[This seems over-aggressive to me.  Perhaps a simple P10, N11, R12 exchange would be easier?]
;W[oj];B[pk];W[mj];B[ph]L[ok]M[ph]C[I kinda like P9 too.  But nothing  wrong with Q12]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[oh];B[pg];W[nl];B[of];W[li];B[mh];W[lk]C[W  makes good shape, while B gets territory..]
;B[do]C[I think the upper corner  is more important, because of the strength of W on the upper side.]
;W[dl];B[nr];W[pr];B[eq]C[Good, this looks like the right direction.];W
[dp]M[ep]C[I  don't know joseki, but this seems bad for W.  After B E4, B has essentially  haned in front of 2 stones, and W helped.]
;B[ep];W[co];B[cn]M[dn]C[I think  this is too much, and should play at d6.  Nice moyo on the bottom now]
;W[eo];B[dn];W[er];B[cp];W[cq];B[bo];W[fp]C[Big loss for B];B[gq];W[fq]
;B[jq];W[hq];B[iq];W[hp];B[de];W[dh]L[fd][kd][kc][lc][mc][jc]
[lb][je]C[Hmmm, this is tough.  I like W F16.  But B  has the double hane starting with L16, so hard to say.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[cg];W[fd]C[Now W has a good moyo, and B has to small groups on the L side]
;B[cj];W[dj];B[ck];W[dk];B[cl];W[ci];B[hf];W[hh];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[dg]
;B[df];W[lo];B[hd]M[em]C[W bottom moyo is getting huge, B should E7 I think.]
;W[bb];B[kd];W[kc];B[jc]M[lc]C[Should atari first at M17];W[ke]C[(M17 atari  would prevent *this* atari)]
;B[jd];W[lb];B[kf];W[lh];B[lg];W[jh];B[kb]C[Good];W[lc];B[ff]M[em][jo]
C[I like E7 or K5 better.   W alive on top, but big moyo on bottom.];W[fh]
;B[jo];W[lq];B[lr];W[mq];B[mr];W[np];B[kq]L[kn]C[Is L3 needed?  Perhaps L6 would be better?]
;W[jm];B[km]C[No time for light moves., L6 better because it  theatens to cut off M3 group.  I don't know an official word for it, but now  you are reducing territory by extending from a living shape.  So you should  stay connected while you it.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[ko];B[io];W[hm]C[
 Scud 15k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[mm]M[om][nn]C[Going to be hard to rescue these  stones.  Might be better to threaten to rescue them.  Moves like P7 or O6.]

;W[nn]C[No need for W to take.];B[pl];W[pm];B[qm];W[ng];B[mg]M[gb][em]
C[I  think that saving those 2 stones is small (6 points?) in this stage of the  game.  Perhaps E7 or G18 better.]
;W[en];B[ho];W[go];B[gn]C[Tough to make  these light moves when directly reducing territory from a living group.]
;W[hn];B[gm];W[hk];B[ih];W[ii];B[ig];W[hi];B[gl];W[ik];B[bq]C[Good, W B4 was a big  move.]
