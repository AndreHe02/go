AB[dp][pd]C[This was the second game I played against this opponent; the first time, I'd won by 23.5 (both times I played as white).]
;W[dd]C[I decided to open on the corner, since that's what I'm best at.]
;B[qp]
(;W[dm]C[I decided to approach on the fourth line (to see what happened).

Asubaba : To make a kakari against the stones at Q16 and D4 is miai, When there is a miai most of the times it is better to wait for the exact moment, instead a kakari at P3 or P4 seems to be more important at the moment if black plays there he will be very strong]
;B[cn];W[bm]C[Jumping out seemed like the best choice (I wasn't too worried about the push at C7 - should I have been?)

B7 is not a good choice it leads to two cutting points in whites shape]

(;B[cq]C[This move surprised me slightly; seemed slightly submissive for black.

You are right C7 is much more active]
(;W[dh]C[Had to extend toward my 4-4 stone (maybe extend higher?).

C14 or C13 is better; when to extend to have all of the stones at the same level is not so good ( in your case black can attack from underneath ), for extension a wave shape is better ( one stone at fourth line one at thirth line )]
;B[jc]
(;W[hc]C[Now it seems like I have a loose moyo, though I was worried about any potential reductions.

All of your stones are at fourth line so you are right to worry for an attack]
;B[je]C[This move is sente for bllack because white have a weakness at F17, black makes more territory at these moves]
;W[he];B[jg];W[hp]C[I didn't like the wall he was forming, but I'm not sure if more jumping followed by a hard invasion would have worked.]
;B[fp]
(;W[hm]C[Was worried about getting my H4 stone cut off - it seemed rather weak compared to the black group (though it would still have aji anyway).]
;B[jp]C[Black got the territorial move first!];W[jm]
(;B[lm]C[This move is weird, black can not attack white stones by this way]
;W[kk]C[This was meant to cut black into two groups.

These moves from both side do not make any territory, do not forget that Go is about making territory]
;B[kl];W[jl];B[lk];W[kj];B[ii]C[How to respond to this stone?]

Both off you forget to invade, instead both of you kill many aji at the borderline]

Still you may have a chance to invade although after 3-3 invasion the chance gets smaller]

C[That seemed like a waste of moves - hence why I abandoned it.

You spend too many moves before abondoning, and your small chance to enter in to the moyo gets smaller and smaller as black gets stronger and stronger inside]
