;B[dp]C[Hello, I'm playing White in this game and I felt it went well for me most of the time (please verify that). Losing was quite a disappointment for me, although I knew I made terrible mistakes in the end.

Please comment on any situation you have a feeling about, any interesting feedback can be helpful for my weakening go skills :)

I've made some comments/questions along the way, please verify/answer them.

df: My comments will be marked with df.  I think you are too focussed on territory and capturing big groups.  You allow yourself to get weak while your opponent gets thick, then you try to kill the lower left while he takes territory.]
;W[pp];B[pd];W[dc]C[df: The 3-3 and 4-4 points are more popular because this move gives black a good approach move, abckup by his stone in the lower corner.]
;B[de]LB[ce:A]C[df: Professionals almost always attach at A in this position.]
;W[cg];B[ef]C[This move is supposed to no longer be considered joseki, but I didn't know that at the time of the game. I believe a lot of us amateurs play it a lot.

df: This move is fine,];W[gc];B[dh]
(;W[ci]LB[ce:a]C[Now this is bad, right? C15 instead gives White a huge corner and Black a cramped position but it didn't occur to me.]
;B[di];W[cj];B[dj];W[ck];B[el];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj]LB[jp:a]C[Now if I was Black I'd feel K4 was the natural move and as White I'd feel uncomfortable answering Black K4.

How could the game progress after Black K4 now? Would that be really good for Black?

df: K4 or O3 is just a matter of style.  Both are fine.  I prefer O3 because white has a stone at Q10, to limit the size of the lower right corner.]
;B[nq];W[kp];B[no];W[qn];B[ip]C[After this move I felt that trouble begins for White, this was the first crucial decision.]
;W[kn];B[nm]
(;W[mp]C[My opponent claims it was an aji-keshi.

df: Once you peep here you lose some options to respond to the corner invasion.  If you don't peep, you can make black live in the corner and perhaps connect under to your stone at l4. Even if you don't connect under, the black stones will be weaker.]
;B[np];W[pl];B[qq];W[pq];B[pr]
(;W[qp];B[rr];W[rq];B[qr];W[cq]C[Now that is a move that's either good or bad. Tend to the centre group first?

df: I would strengthen the center group first, unless you are confident you can end in sente here.  After this invasion black will be much thicker, so if he ends with sente, your center group will suffer greatly.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[dr];B[er];W[eq];B[do];W[fr]
;B[cr];W[es];B[br]C[After choosing this variation I thought I made a good decision. Next move is problematic.

df: I don't like this result.  The corner is big.  Your group on the left side is much weaker, and you now have two weak groups on the lower side.  Your stones at E3 need another move, so you didn't end in sente.

It's very hard to find a way to attack the stone at J4 since black is so thick.  This is a bad situation for white, so your choice of joseki in the lower left was not good.]

(;W[io]C[df: I don;t like this move either.  Black has one weak stone bewteen your two weak groups.  You need to attack this stone. Attaching to a stone is not the way to attack it.  Usually when you attach to a single stone you are trying to make the group heavier, so you can then attack two stones instead of one.  But in this case, the black stone is cuttting your two weak groups, so black already needs to save it, so there is no need to make it heavy.]
;B[hp];W[fo];B[gn];W[gq];B[hr];W[gr];B[in]C[This whole sequence didn't turn out as I expected.

df: now you are cut, and yuor group at L4 is weaker.];W[jn]
;B[im];W[ll];B[jl];W[mn];B[nn];W[mk]C[Now I still felt I had a good game.

df: yes.  You have settled two weak groups without giving up much.  Your left side still needs reinforcement, and black is thicker, so you are not doing as well as you think.  With this move you are out, but this shape is not as strong as it looks (as you find out later).]
;B[qh];W[mr];B[nr]
(;W[qc]LB[pf:a]C[My opponent criticized this move, Q14 instead seems better?

df: I would look at Q12 to make some thickness to balance against black's thickness.  If Q14 leads to you running away on dame it doesn't gain you anything.  If you and black run out, you might want to make territory on the upper side.  In that case you prefer not to take the corner first and make black thick.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[pf]
(;W[qg]C[df: I don;t like this sequence since it lets black rip up your right side.]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[pi];W[oh];B[oi];W[qi];B[qj];W[rh];B[pk];W[oj]
;B[ok];W[ni]
(;B[qk]C[This sequence turned out bad for Black, I felt I had a won game now, is that correct?

df: it doesn't look like a won game to me.  Your left side is still weak.  You need to live in the lower right, so black should get sente.  You didn't get much territory on the right side. I think you are not counting the cost of your weak group on the left.]

(;W[ql];B[nk]
(;W[rp]C[This move is not quite sente for White, which I sadly overlooked. I was hoping for the Wp3 Bp2 Wt2 sequence but Black has eyes elswhere or escapes.

df: black can cut your bottom group at N10.  Instead he plans to make you connect while taking center territory.]
;B[bf]C[That hurt, I overlooked it too. I just barely lived, after the sequence my opponent said that he knew he could've attacked harder but he was afraid of a difficult fight.

df: this is the cost of your lower left joseki choice, that weakened this group.]
;W[bg]
(;B[cd]C[Now instead of that he could've played B8 right? And then White tries to get out and Black's fate is unknown...

df: this is better - take the upper left corner when you live in gote.  This is an important concept that you need to understand. Make your opponent live in gote while you take territory or get thick.  Do not try to kill him unless the sequence is straightforward.]
;W[dl]C[That's a strange move, dangerous.];B[dm];W[bl];B[bm]
;W[ch];B[ji]C[At this point my opponent had a serious doubt between this move and C17.

df: since you answer it on a dame, he gets both.];W[mj]C[I thought (again) that it is sente against lower right.

df: this is the move that puts you well behind.  Even if it is sente, it doesn't gain anything because it's dame.  You make this move because you don't want to get cut here.]
;B[cc]C[df: black picked up a lot of points while you were focussed on killing the lower right.  Big groups are hard to kill.  It's better to plan to take your points while harassing a big group. Don't plan your game so it requires you to kill a big group to win.]
;W[oq]C[Too soon, better answer at K17, right?]
(;B[mq];W[lr]C[Bad, Black lives, better play P2 now if anything?]
;B[lq];W[kq];B[jr]C[Painful to my left side group.];W[kr];B[or]
;W[sr];B[lp];W[jp];B[pn];W[ol]C[That was plain stupid.

df: Mistake.  Makes black stronger so he can cut you.  you are OK since you have the move at H5, but you are already behind.]
;B[nl];W[po];B[mo]
(;W[jc]LB[lm:b][ho:a]C[Now my last chance seemed to be to play the (obvious!) move of White H5 instead. But I'm doomed anyway because I didn't see Black M7 coming.

df: yes!  If you play h5, you get your reward from attack the weak black group.  The the M7 cut doesn't matter.  You will still have to avoid giving black a lot of territory at the top when he attacks G17.]
