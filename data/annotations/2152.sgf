C[David (black) vs GnuGo 3.2 (white)

Nov 2002

I am a new learner of Go. I dare not to play with other humans on the web.
Therefore I play against the computer. I read some introductory books and
now I hope to know which level I have reached. I made this file with Jago.
Thanks for your comments.

exswoo (12k):Hi. I'll be the one reviewing your game.  I'll try to point out any major mistakes you make.]
;B[qp]C[me first.];W[dd];B[dq];W[pd];B[oq];W[do];B[jd]LB[fq:A]
C[I
choose to destroy his "three linked stars" rather than defend my left bottom corner. Is it correct ?

exswoo:That's fine, although I think defending the bottom should take slightly more priority, since a White play around A threatens both the lower left corner and the middle.]
;W[cq];B[fp];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[dp];W[cp];B[qg];W[qe]
(;B[qk]LB[qi:A]C[You're playing very low  and the jump too big for it to be safe due to the possibility of white A.    Either Q-10 or R-10 would be better moves.]
;W[lc];B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[dh]LB[jb:A]
C[Let's take a quick look at the current situation. Your bottom moyo and the white's left side is about even, and  your right side and white's top is about even as well, so Black is slightly ahead here.

Your top group is worth less than what you think because it is open to a white invasion at around A, so you might want to defend it when you get sente.]
;B[of]LB[ck:B][jq:A]C[I hope to get the upper left corner and the whole lower right region.

A bit early to have such thoughts in mind :)  You have a lot of influence on the bottom but it is very open to attack  at A.  Of course, you can invade yourself at B.]

(;W[em];B[gm];W[fk]
(;B[kp]LB[ip:A][mp:B]C[defend my lower side.

This is a good idea, but but your connection is too loose to be very effective.  White can still pull off an invasion rather easily at A or B.

I'd suggest linking closer for a firm connection.];W[oo];B[nn]
LB[qn:B][mq:A]C[capture white ?

Not realistic.  It'll be very hard to capture him since you don't have enough influence in this area, and trying to capture him will probably force you to a bad overall situation.

Defending at either A or B is a much better idea.  Also, remember that you can still invade white's moyo at the left side.]
;W[jj]LB[on:A]C[??

Umm...well, what do you expect from a computer opponent? ;)  Capturing that lone white stone at the lower left side seems very possible now if you play around A.]
;B[kk]LB[pi:F][ck:E][hk:G][on:B][qn:C][mp:A][iq:D]C[If you respond directly to a bad move, then it's not a bad move anymore.  There are much bigger places to play instead of trying to block this useless stone.

A-F are all big points for black.  If you want to attack the stone at the center, threatening to cut at G will work as well.]
;W[jh];B[ki]C[I don't know how to respond to white actually.

You need to keep white's moyo from becoming too big, so an invasion onto the left side is in order.  Don't  let white push you around too much.]
;W[kj];B[ji];W[ij];B[li];W[lj];B[ii]C[I guess I can surround a place above.]

;W[im];B[km];W[qn];B[pm];W[rl];B[qm];W[qo];B[rm];W[pn];B[om]
;W[jb];B[le];W[mi];B[mh];W[bc]LB[ni:A]C[A pon-nuki (capturing a single stone by surrounding it) is a huge move.

It is often said that a pon-nuki is worth 30 points.  This is a major point for you, because after this, it will be almost inpossible for white to invade to the right.]

(;B[bb];W[bd];B[ec];W[hn];B[hp]C[give up G7

I'm not confident in "big fight". That's why I always move defensively.]
;W[gn];B[ib]C[This is not a very good defensive move...look at the var for why.]

(;W[gg];B[hf];W[mk];B[ni];W[ll];B[qc]C[is it possible to squeeze and kill the white group ?

Maybe if you're pro :)  As it stands, white has too much space for you to kill.]
;W[pc];B[kl];W[lk];B[mm];W[jc];B[ok]C[avoid the invaded white. but it wasted me many stones.

This is fine.  But you really need to defend the top group soon.]

(;B[cj]C[is it possible to attack here ?

Very possible, although it would've been a lot better if you did it sooner.  It also depends on how skilled you are at such things.]
;W[cl];B[bh];W[cf];C[I give up.

black 180
white 181 +5.5

Are there any serious weaknesses in my playing skills and style ?

How can I improve my playing strength ?

Thank you very much.

David.

exswoo:

It's hard to discern what your actual level is by looking at this game.  Your opening is a lot better than many of the other 20k+ players I've seen but your mid-game is very weak, as is knowing when to defend and when to attack.

Both you and the computer made a number of questionable moves but you did well in knowing that certain groups of stones were dead without playing them out to the end.

Something that may help you improve is to change your thinking to "Can I kill this group?" to "Can I confine this group of stones to a small area while making mine larger?"  Killing large groups, while not rare, is not something you'll see in most games.  Your play will certainly improve if you become less ambitious about such things.  That is not to say to not kill when you see the chance to, however.

Try also to be on the attack when you can.  You were on the defensive for most this game, and such habits will lead you to lose many, many games.

I definitely suggest that you start playing real life opponents instead of GNU go.  There are many styles of Go playing out there and computer programs tend to play a leisure style that many players forego (For example, there was no real battles in this game at all).  There are many beginners like you out there on-line and you certainly have a good enough grip of the basics to put up a good fight.

Good luck :)])
