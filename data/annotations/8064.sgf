;B[pd]C[Hi thanks for reviewing my game. I put comments throughout the game to give you a clue what I was thinking.

Brakeshoe

> [Claude Brisson\] Hi. I'll do my best.];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[fq];W[er]C[Brakeshoe - I didn't know how to take advantage of this, havent been dealt that move often.

> It's a legitimate move. Extend lightly at K4, defend at F2 or attack at C6.]
;B[eq]C[> You're not gaining anything with this exchange.];W[dq]
;B[fr];W[nq];B[jq]C[Brakeshoe - Trying to kill two birds with one stone making a pincer and an expansion

> why not, but no real choice - white here would be painfull]
;W[no];B[pn];W[lr];B[de]C[Brakeshoe - I thought atacking this corner was worth more than securing lower side in gote

> you're right, plus you're not in real danger];W[fd];B[dh]
;W[ef];B[df];W[eg]
(;B[dd]C[> don't attack directly strong formations, he will reinforce himself]
;W[cc]C[> now you would need a move around B16 to get a better shape and close the door, so the attack wasn't interesting]
;B[cn]C[> locally good, but your group in the upper left is not strong enough to attack elsewhere]
;W[co]TR[dk]C[Brakeshoe - My plan was having a stone there.]
(;B[dn]C[Brakeshoe - Is it the only way to answer?

> see var];W[dk]
(;B[cj]C[Brakeshoe - I guesed i couldn't link them so I attacked white while securing my position on top left. With hope maybe i could link d6 to f3.]
(;W[dj]
(;B[di];W[ck];B[bj];W[fo]
(;B[ep]C[> leave the cut for later, cutting is an attacking option and you must be stronger to attack]
;W[eo];B[do];W[bp]TR[cn][dn][do][ep][eq][fq][fr]C[Brakeshoe - Both groups look weak now and white has good influence towards middle, at that point i thought i had lost.]
(;B[dr]C[> you're not yet in danger and this will loose sente]
;W[cr];B[es]
(;W[gp];B[br];W[cq];B[cs];W[bn];B[bq];W[cp];B[ap];W[bo];B[bm]
;W[em];B[an]C[> well done];W[hq]
(;B[is]C[Brakeshoe - Was impossible to connect but, I was worried about the huge center he was getting, and I didnt have much on top and little on right. I tought running with k5 was helping him.

> yes, but it becomes a reduction yose move];W[ir]C[Brakeshoe [11k\]: pas fort]
;B[hs];W[jr];B[hc];W[gc];B[hd];W[nc];B[lc]C[Brakeshoe - again a pincer and an expansion]
;W[ne]C[Brakeshoe - He did that again on lower right, escaping then invading. Is it a run before you live thing? Was Q14 the best move?

> there is plenty of space here, so he will get something whatever you do - if he does so anyway he will have two groups to take care of, finish sente in the corner and let you attack O17 & O15]
;B[pf];W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[> WRONG DIRECTION! Leave him with two groups!];W[pc]
;B[md];W[nd];B[qj]C[Brakeshoe - Here i felt pretty confident having a piece of top and whole right - almost.

> since you let him connect his two groups, it's a piece of cake for him locally]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[> ok, maybe this time you can play this way]
(;W[rq];B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qs]
(;B[rp];W[oq];B[ge]C[Brakeshoe - This was one of my slowest moves i believe , i could have P10 instead or O7.

> well, it looks rather sente to me...];W[pl];B[ql];W[pm];B[qm]
;W[on];B[pk];W[ol]
(;B[ok]C[Brakeshoe -  In any attempt to get some of the center. I think i should find a way to play lighter moves to achieve that, maybe it was too late already.]
;W[nk];B[nj];W[mk]
(;B[ee];W[fe];B[ff]C[Brakeshoe - Worst move ever? He could have F13?]
;W[gf];B[fg];W[fh];B[gg];W[gh];B[hf];W[eh];B[hh];W[ei];B[dg]
C[Brakeshoe - I thought my shape was defective.];W[hi]
(;B[gd]C[> you're spoiling E17];W[fc];B[ii]C[Brakeshoe - Maybe J11 can connect somewhere

> no, it looks okay]
(;W[ih];B[hg];W[jh]
(;B[ej]C[Brakeshoe - Should have played the variation. I was thinking too big.

> true, and the problem of the center would have been solved]

(;B[ng]C[> gote];W[mj];B[ni];W[ij];B[mi];W[li];B[lh];W[ki]
(;B[kg]C[Brakeshoe - This move didn't attack him much so he just found what i was worried about.

> well, he is rather strong everywhere... try to play sente yose moves or bigger gote moves in this case]

[er][gr][as][bs][ds][fs][gs]C[Brakeshoe - Black wins by 4,5 pts, we had a 0,5 komi and he was demoted to11k right after the game so it was very close.

I do not cut often enough during my games, and in this one I couldnt get a piece of middle, always fighting for territory in the sides. I am awating your advice , thanks.
