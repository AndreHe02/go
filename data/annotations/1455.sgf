AB[pd][dp][pp][dd]C[Hello,

I would like to have a review of the game in the attached .sgf  file, please.  My name is Mike Malveaux, and i had white in this  4-stone handicap game.  Currently i am ranked 16k* on IGS (where  i play once or twice a month) and 10k on KGS (where i play a few  times per week).  My opponent, Jason Baghboudarian, is currently  ranked 16k on KGS, but i feel he is a couple stones stronger  than that.

I lost by more than 20 points.  Since this is Jason's 3rd win in  a row at 4 stones, we are changing his handicap to 3 for our  next game.  As i'm sure you can imagine, i am happy that my  friend is getting stronger, but frustrated that i'm apparently  stagnating, so any pointers you can give will be most welcome.

Jason and i play together on a wooden board about once a week,  so we know each others' styles pretty well.  This game is a bit  of a departure for me, because in our games, i usually open with  a stone on 4-10, 3-10, 4-6, or 3-6.  This is the first time i've  opened with 10-10.

I think i lost the game around move 95, when i failed to  appreciate that my key group splitting two black groups could  run out of liberties (though perhaps i lost it as early as move  65 with Q9 instead of P10 ?).  I saw there was a danger of  being cut, but my play 97 at N9 was totally inadequate.  I  guess i would most like an analysis of the big middle game  fight, particularly the moves from about White 65 through 119.   However, i am of course eager for any comments you  sees fit.

Thanks, and best wishes,  - Mike Malveaux

My name is Peter Hoehe. I am living in germany. I play on IGS as no2k and also on KGS. My strength on IGS is about 7k, on KGS approaching 2k. So please consider, that this is not much more than your's. I will comment this game from the beginning, not looking at the result. I hope this will be enjoyable (and a little helpful) to you., -
Peter Hoehe];W[jj];B[ji]C[no2k: A Proverb says: Attaching makes stronger. Thats not what black wants. Black has a lead of 4 stones.]
;W[pj];B[ij];W[np]C[no2k: Correct. A proverb says: There is no territory in the center. So white does good ignoring it.]
;B[pm]C[no2k: A move on the 4th line is influence orientated. Black cannot do much with influence there, because of the white stone being already there.]
;W[jk]C[no2k: White should keep ignoring the center. You gained one move there.]
;B[hi];W[jp]C[no2k: good move.];B[ki]C[no2k: The influence black is creating in the center looks good, but you must know, that white can easily invade the top, and live there. The black wall will be ineffective then.]
;W[ic]C[no2k: correct, perhaps a light play on the 4th line is more appropriate.]
;B[ie]C[no2k: It is consistent];W[ld]C[no2k: That is too far. The white stones at the top can be separated.]
;B[og]LB[qh:a][nc:b]C[no2k: What does black want. This move should be at A, when he wants to attack the white stone, or at B, when he wants to attack the 2 white stones at the top. This move seems only to connect the secure corner to the secure center.]
;W[qh]C[no2k: very good, getting a base.];B[dj]C[no2k: also very good.]
;W[gd];B[dg];W[fq];B[em]C[no2k: too ambitious. This can be easily invaded on the 3rd line.]
;W[oe]LB[qc:a][qq:b]C[no2k: Normally that can be a good strategy for white, when he wants to get influence. But in this situation, what can white do with the influence? The resulting influence is negated by the black center.  Both players are playing for influence up to this point. It is advisable for white now to get territory either by invading one or two of the corners. Black for himself cannot do much with the sulting wall. I would prefer A or B.]
;B[nc];W[pf];B[qc]C[no2k: good.];W[mg];B[md];W[me];B[ne];W[nf]
;B[nd];W[le];B[lc];W[kc];B[kf]C[no2k: That move makes nearly no territory, nor help it the center. It is strong.]
;W[mi]C[no2k: small, the corner are still open.];B[rf];W[qg]
;B[qe];W[qq]C[no2k: good. That is the weakist black point.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[qk];W[cm]C[no2k: big too.];B[dq];W[co];B[eo]
;W[ck]C[no2k: very good. This group is settled.];B[dk];W[bq]
;B[cj];W[bk];B[hq]
(;W[gp]C[no2k: That is dangerous. You should be generous to black. You got the left side in return. How about the variation?]
;B[dc]LB[bj:a]C[no2k: also big, but not so big as it seems. Ther is a whole at A.]
;W[lj]MA[hq]LB[on:a][gn:b][hp:c]C[no2k: That does nothing. Try to find moves, that expands your territory. You may take a firm grip an the marked black stone with C or try to expand your bottom moyo with A then B.
The lonely black stone is not dead right now, see the variation.]

(;B[hm]C[no2k: a cool move. black get center territory in return.]
;W[fn];B[en];W[gl];B[of]C[no2k: pointless.];W[pe];B[ng];W[mf]
;B[oi];W[pk]LB[qj:a]C[no2k a little dangerous. Saver at A.]
;B[nj];W[hl]LB[nl:a]C[no2k: A would have been the normal move. Black cannot escape easily.]
;B[fm];W[gm];B[gn];W[fo]LB[hn:a]C[no2k: not necessary just play at A.You may give up one stone.]
;B[hn];W[hp]C[no2k: good];B[kn];W[il];B[hr];W[jr]LB[lq:a]C[no2k: A move at A should be enough. Black cannot make life at the bottom.]
;B[lp]C[no2k: good]
(;W[op]LB[lq:a]C[no2k: Better to defend territory at A. See varation.]
;B[kl];W[ol]LB[nm:a][nl:b]MA[of][ng][og][oi][nj][kl][kn][lp]
[hm][hn][gn]C[no2k: What about A or B? Alle the marked black stones are floating and do not have any eye.]
;B[om];W[mm]C[no2k Too late i think.]
(;B[nn]LB[mn:a]C[no2k: No. The move at A seems to do the trick of connecting the black goups to the right.]
;W[ql]LB[mn:a]C[no2k: Oops. Just play at A and the black center is virtually dead.]

[pr][qr][rr][sr][as][js][ms][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[no2k: You both played in interesting game. Black did win mostly because he made territory oriented moves first.
You both played influenced oriented moves during the first 20 or 30 moves. When black dominates the center, it is not possible for white to gain territory there. And all the influence white will build is looking against the black center. Because of this white cannot gain much by buildung up more influence. Just taking territory is enough.  I hope you enjoy my comments. If there are any questions, please contact me.
