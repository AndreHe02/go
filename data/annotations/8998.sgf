;W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[fc]LB[hc:C][fd:B][df:A]C[You should adapt the choice of joseki to the global situtation on the board. Here the simple josekis are at A, B and C.

After considering a number of basic possibilities, the joseki you chose is not bad but, since it gives black the right side, forces you to play at Q10 instead of enclosing your corner with C5, which is the priority for you.

So I would choose the C variation here.]

[js][ks][ls][ms][ns]C[There are three main reasons you lost this game :

1) You can now see that the reduction around N6 gave you 2 points and allowed black to take many points at the bottom and at the top by attacking your weak stones. Moreover, the other reduction stone at M14 ended up dead and unused. Conclusion : you should only attack and reduce from a strong position.

2) You made some big endgame mistakes around F11 (~10 points lost), C7 (~ 6 points lost) and T11 (~ 6 points lost) : black should not have been allowed to enter your territory.

3) You did not see that you could still enter the top right corner. But this was a little more difficult to see.

I hope my comment can help you get better !
