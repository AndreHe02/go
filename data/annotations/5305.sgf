AB[pd][dp]C[Hi. I am Radu and I will gladly comment your game. I am around 10k on LG and DGS, sites for turn based games. If you want, you can find me on these 2 sites as rd21275; and I promise you that I accept game invitations ;)

Hello, my name is Chris, I am playing black in this game, I know that I'm not very good, but I just wanted to thank you for your review. And I'm also looking for a teacher, so if you would be willing to teach me or know somebody who is I would like that very much. Also if you see anything else that I could have improved on, or any different moves that I could have made in those situations, please comment on that as well. Thank you.]

[dj:D][qm:2][jp:E]C[R: It is a handicap game. As a general advice, don't attack. It is supposed he is better than you, so don't start local fights when the result is unpredictible.
Another general advice: don't attack in contact, but defend in contact.
Esp at the start of the game, aim for big empty points, rather than involving in local fights. The letters are indicating my choices, in order of importance, and the figures the possibilities of attacking r10, but remember, you shouldn't do it.


Was this the best response to this move? What would have been some other good moves?]
;W[pk]CR[pi]LB[ed:A]C[R: he made hane, enforce your stone and prepare the attack at A.

Also how should I react to this?];B[qi];W[pi];B[oj];W[ri];B[qh]
;W[oh]C[R: W at o10 is dangerous, but for a while, take the other big points.]
;B[rj]C[R: it is a local fight and you loose sente. See previous.]
;W[rk];B[qk];W[ql];B[qj];W[rl];B[rh];W[qo];B[pl]CR[qp]C[R: again you loose sente, now W o10 it is no more dangerous. You should protect the corner]
;W[pm];B[ol];W[qp];B[om]C[R: it is an important move, but not so important as corner. For the beginning, fight for the corners and neglect the center, in time you'll master the play in center as well. But the first goals should be corners and sides. Even if sometime you'll loose because opp takes all the center, this shouldn't be a problem.]
;W[pn];B[on];W[pq];B[op]C[R: good, preserve as much as you can of remaining in corner]
;W[oq];B[nq]CR[np]C[R: even if the lost is enormous, sometimes is better to loose points but to not let ajis behind. O4 is a very nasty aji!]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr]C[R: not again, esp when you already have aji at o4. You should continue on line 3]
;W[ms];B[ls];W[or];B[nh]CR[lp]C[R: NO. The ajis on bottom side are extremelly dangerous. And m4 would protect both. It is a MUST move.]
;W[og];B[ng];W[of];B[ne]LB[nd:A][qf:B]C[R: If your aim is the up side, use A. If the aim is right side, use B. Your move is a capturing move, and if your net succeeds, you win serious points.]
;W[cn];B[dn]C[R: good, playing against the wall.];W[cp];B[cm]
SQ[cq]C[R: hane in corner! Don't neglect corners.];W[bm];B[bn]
C[R: What for? That way, corner is clearly White.];W[co];B[bl]
;W[do];B[ep];W[cq]C[R: And W doesn't hesitate.];B[eo];W[dm]
;B[am];W[en];B[em]LB[dl:C][go:B][er:A]C[R: Hmmm, is doing nothing. Your left side group hasn't yet life, nor the reamining of the corner. This is the third group you need to care of! Alternatives: letters.]
;W[dq]C[R: W doesn't need it... W should play c8...];B[fn];W[dn]
;B[el]C[R: lucky, you managed to box in. Good.];W[bo]C[R: oh no! W should attack c8 long time ago, but now it is vital for black!!!]
;B[dl]C[R: Great! Because W let you, now you have one single alive group, instead of 3 dying groups. It was very poorly played by W. (I hope you don't get upset, I really want to show you what should be played, without diminishing your merits)...]
;W[eq];B[fq]C[R: again, you let too many ajis behind. I would prefer f4, despite I make a really ugly shape.]
;W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr]CR[fm][fo][oo][fp][np][lq]C[R: not again. Let's see, you let 6 cutting points which give W plenty of opportunities. There are far too many.]
;W[gs];B[ec]C[R: big point, but again the cutting points have to be defended.]
;W[dc]C[R: Hmmm, I would choose another defense: d14.]
(;B[ee]C[R: no, the e16 is another cutting point to ggod to be missed. The usual joseki is in alternative.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[dd]C[R: and now you see why: again you have many cutting points.]
;B[gc]C[R: in this case, I would simply connect, but it is only a matter of taste.]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[de];B[ef];W[dg];B[df];W[cf];B[eg];W[dh];B[eh]
;W[di];B[ei];W[dj];B[ej];W[dk];B[ek];W[ck];B[cl];W[bk];B[ak]
C[R: this is a closing move, the cutting points on bottom are screaming.]
;W[aj];B[al];W[bj];B[fb]C[R: now you should really pay attention on bottom, or even to finalize the work on p14 group]
;W[ea];B[jj]C[R: it is a defending move, but even so, I would base it on teh up side, where it is lot of space.
But more urgent: the aji on bottom.];W[jc]CR[mc]C[R: Where are you weak? Where he can use some aji? The answer is: right side. There you have to defend.

What is the best response to this move?];B[jd]C[R: you don't want to let W take a base. To run in center? Where? W will hit directly your stone at k10, or maybe your walls on the other 3 sides. You don't want to avoid W running for center, but to take his base.]
;W[kd];B[je];W[md]C[R: now he uses the group left as aji];B[kc]
C[R: no, this attack is small and it is loosing sente];W[lc]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[nd]C[R: and now W really threats destroying all the corner.]
;B[oe];W[od];B[pe];W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[qa];B[ra];W[pa]
;B[rb];W[lf];B[ke];W[ld];B[le];W[me];B[mf]C[R: good];W[hs]CR[hq]
C[R: close as many aji as possible.

How should I have responded to this move?];B[ir]C[R: it wouldn't be bad if the B would be really solid there. This approach is very risky.]
;W[is];B[js]C[R: oh, no. Why? He is capturing m2 group, unavoidable.]
;W[jr];B[ks];W[lq];B[jq];W[kr];B[lp]C[R: W succeeded to penetrate B walls, B should look limitting the entrance.]
;W[mp];B[np]C[R: no, let W has them. Close the doors, not save the groups.]
;W[mo];B[kq];W[no];B[oo];W[iq]
(;B[hq]C[R: again, let W has groups...];W[ip]C[At this point what should I have done?]
;B[ko]CR[fp]C[R: you shouldn't defend this, as you have the capture at m2, but the other cut!]
;W[fo];B[fp]C[R: you only feeds with more prisoners...];W[go]
;B[ho]C[R: futile];W[hp];B[gn];W[gp];B[io];W[jp];B[kp];W[jo]
;B[kn]C[R: yup, this is right];W[jn];B[im];W[jm];B[km];W[jl]
;B[kl];W[il];B[hl];W[ik];B[ij];W[hn];B[hm];W[in];B[hk]C[R:  good, finally W is closed]
;W[jk];B[kk];W[fa];B[ga];W[ao];B[db]C[R: good >:)];W[cb];B[da]
;W[ca];B[an];W[lr];B[la];W[ma];B[na];W[ka]C[R: wrong, should simply connect]
;B[mb]C[R: wrong, you should take o18!!!];W[nb];B[la];W[oc]
;B[oa];W[mc];B[ja];W[ma];B[ka];W[ic];B[ib];W[hb];B[mb];W[nf]
;B[mg];W[ma];B[bd];W[ia];B[bf];W[bc]C[R: the other hane...]
;B[be];W[ce];B[cg];W[bg];B[cc]C[R : W is doomed];W[ch];B[bi]
C[R: or not? You should make simple atari at b12];W[cf]C[R: oh, no...]

[dk][fk][gk][lk][mk][nk][ok][pk][fl][gl][ll][ml][nl][bm][fm]
[gm][lm][mm][nm][ln][mn][nn][lo][mo][no][mp]C[R: there are some unexpected changes in the balance: the invasion on bottom side, the ko on upper side, the loose of left side. Overall, I would recommend you to take more care to the ajis left behind and to emphasize the corners. There is a proverb: if you loose 4 corners, resign the match.

If you have any question, I am waiting them.

Cheers, Radu

Well, thank you again for the review.])

(;B[ed];W[df];B[ic];W[ci];B[ie]C[R: B takes a large moyo on up side, W lives and keeps an option for center. That's why I said from beginning about d14...]
