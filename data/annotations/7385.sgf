C[Hello!

I'm Bernd, German 2k, HonFu in the GTL and on KGS. I have added my ideas in the file, please correct my thinking and reading and help me understand this game.

Thank you!];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc];B[cp];W[ep];B[eq]C[Here I thought that I could afford to take the corner, since in the end I will be able to make a shimari in the lower right, but ...]
;W[fq];B[dq];W[qo]LB[pe:A]C[... my opponent went there first.

reid: Yes, but at the cost of leaving F3 and E4 in a rather weak position.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the play by either side up to this point.

Now I wondered how to pincer that stone. A low pincer would only invite white's press at Q15, so I thought, a high pincer was a must.

reid: Perhaps, but then the question becomes: would it be better for black to play at A (Q15) immediately instead of the pincer?  I think it would be better because white seems to be rushing a bit.  Black should play steadily to see if he can draw white into over-extending.  After all, black is first in three corners, so he should feel satisfied with the opening so far.]

(;B[pm]LB[kc:B][pe:A][qk:D][ql:C][op:E][jq:F]C[reid: I think more important than the question of high or low is the question of near or far.  Black chooses the close pincer here, which is very severe.  However, it is natural for white to jump out to P5.  When he does, black needs to respond in the corner, and the Q7 stone feels a bit too close to the black wall (two white stoves vs. one black stone on the right side).

Returning to  A in response to R5:  it makes it much harder for white to build a moyo on the top, and it prepares to pincer R5 with C or D (assuming white answeres at B).  It also makes a white pressing move at E less attractive to white.

Long range, black would like to get a stone somewhere around F so white can't finish the F3 joseki in the normal way.  For example, see the variation.]
;W[oo];B[np];W[om];B[ol];W[nm];B[pn];W[po];B[no];W[on]C[Here I wanted to destroy the shape of the white group, but actually my shape will be not so good as well in one of to places, so did I play this correctly or not?

reid: It seems like both sides are rushing things a bit.  White left the lower left corner to play Q5, and now black is struggling a bit because white P5 makes a nice splitting attack.  White's shape may be damaged here, but black's strategic position is precarious because he has two weak groups near white's strong splitting group (P5, etc). I think if black had been a bit more patient, then white's rushing moves would have led him into trouble.  Instead, black is busy trying to live on both sides.]
;B[pk];W[gp];B[kq]LB[hq:A]C[Since this area was large for both with my weakness around P3, I decided to take the move on the lower side first and allow white's press, but I was not sure of the exact point. Maybe high would be better for attacking white's heavyish group later, but then white can aim at extending under from the left group. Also I did not want to go too far, so that white can not help himself with a dynamic invasion to settle his right group.

reid: I agree that low is better.  You are trying to prevent white from getting eye-space, so a white slide would not be good.

However, I don't think you should worry too much about a white invasion.  The P5 stones have no eye base at all, so an invasion into the M3 area would allow black to make a perfect splitting attack.  Black L3 is too conservative.  I would prefer to attack the white eye-space with something like A.  Try to punish white for having two weak groups.]
;W[co];B[dp];W[do];B[eo];W[fp];B[bo];W[bn];B[bp];W[cm];B[mc]
LB[pe:A][dm:C][en:B][gn:D]C[Here I remembered that you should pincer tightly if you do not want to get pressed low. That seemed to fit my position on the right.

reid: Well, if you don't want to get pressed down. you can take the high move yourself with A.  

But I think the hot area right now is the cut black already has in place at E5.  If black pulls out at B, it looks like he can get three white groups to attack.  White will probably play at C and black can jump to D and it looks like a pretty good splitting attack.  With the lower left corner already alive, and the L3 and Q9 groups looking like they have pretty good shape, this should be a very nice fight for black.  It will be very difficult for white to make any real progress while he is looking after these three groups.]
;W[pe];B[pd];W[od];B[oe];W[md]LB[ne:A][of:B][pf:C]C[This was a deviation of what I know about this joseki. I wondered how to punish it, if possible at all.

reid: Well if we think about white exchanging A for B before he plays N16, then it is natural to consider black A as punishment.  After white fixes his shape, black can come back to C to make this side a rather nice moyo.  Again. white has a hard time invading because the P5 stones have no eye shape yet.]
;B[ld]C[I thought that he wanted to guarantee with his move at N16 that he will capture my stone there and I don't choose the variation where I am on both sides, so I decided to confront his idea right away.

reid: Sometimes it's is best to give him exactly what he wants. I think in this case you would like to exchange the N17 stone for a nice right-side moyo.  And N17 will probably retain some aji value no matter how white responds to black O15.]
;W[me];B[pf]C[Now he can settle his shape, but ...];W[ne];B[of]
C[reid: White should not make this exchange - it is not necessary, and black P14 is more helpful for black than white O15 is for white.

However, black still has to look after two weak groups now.  Black missed a chance to make the game easy.]
;W[lc];B[kc];W[lb];B[kd];W[mb];B[gd]LB[fc:A]C[... I also get my aim of building up on the other side of him. Still, this shape looks so solid now, and later I will have trouble on the right side.

reid: Yes, white is as good as alive with the N15 group, but the black top-side stones don't have a base because white can scoop out the edge from M18.

I think black A (F17) is better than G16.  If white wants to attack the L16 stones, black can sacrifice them  now.  If the N15 stones are already alive, then the L16 group has no strategic function.  Better to look towards reducing white's corner.]
;W[ec]LB[df:A]C[reid: Big corner for white, but white A (to use the strength at C7 while attacking G16) might be more effective.]
;B[cg]C[reid: black gets a toehold in white's moyo.];W[ce];B[cj]
LB[en:A]C[reid: At this point black has groups in all of white's large areas.  White's only significant territory is the upper left corner and that's barely twenty points.  However, black has a lot of weak groups around while white really only has to worry about black pulling out with A (E6).

Bottom line: black has the territorial advantage, but white has a strategic advantage.  It is up to white to figure out how to use black's weak groups effectively.]
;W[en];B[rq]LB[eb:B][fb:A][bf:C]C[reid: Black S3 is big, but not urgent.  I would prefer to help my weak groups while reducing territory with black A.  If white responds with B, I would play black C next.]
;W[ql]C[Here maybe sacrificing two stones was an idea, but this seemed like such a shame, since then white would not feel his bad shape any longer. On the other hand connecting gives me bad shape too, and later when he comes in here, I'll be in trouble.

reid: I agree, black must connect.  This is just a forcing move that white deserves to get.]
;B[pl];W[eg];B[cl];W[bl];B[bk];W[dl];B[ck];W[dm]LB[ej:A][dk:B]
C[Was this really necessary? I did not see anything here ...

reid: Neither do I.  Better would be to enclose black with A and force him to live inside.  White will then be able to attack the weak L16 stones on a large scale.  That would be a pretty terrible result for black.

How did that happen?  Well first, S3 should be used for defense instead of a gote territory grab.  Second, C8 goes against the proverb: 'play away from strength'!  Simply jumping to A instead of C8 would be better.  And going for ko shape with C9 at B would also be better.]
;B[ej]C[reid: white misses a chance.];W[di];B[ci]LB[ek:A]C[reid: Black can play at A directly instead of here.  White cannot cut off the C13 stone.]
;W[ei];B[ek]C[reid: so if the sequence was white D11, black E9, white E11, would black want to play at C11 next?  No, of course he would play elsewhere.  So white E11 for black C11 is a good exchange for white (mistake for black).]
;W[ic]C[reid; white probes at black's weakest group.];B[id]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[gc];B[bf]LB[jg:A][jh:B]C[reid: Why is black defending his strong group?  This group has a base and access to the center from E9.  Better to defend the weak group and jump out to A or B]
;W[hh];B[jg];W[lg];B[ji];W[kh];B[jh];W[lj];B[hi];W[pi]C[So here he comes, splitting me, and I seem to be in trouble. There might have been a bit of luck in my getting away.

reid: Well, both sides have weak groups on the board.  That really throws the game into chaos and puts a lot of chance into it (at least when amatuers are playing!)

From here on, things are really too complicated for me to understand.  My recommendation would be to be more aware of strong and weak groups on the board.  If you have weak groups, your first priority should be to stabilize them so your opponent doesn't get free moves by attacking them (unless you are willing to sacrifice them).   If you both have weak groups, then try to defend your weakness by attacking his.  If your groups are OK but his are weak, strike while the iron is hot and get those free moves while attacking.  Don't make additional weak groups if you already have one or more.  I always feel that if my opponent has two weak groups anwhere on the board, I should be able to win by driving those weaknesses together to get double-strength splitting moves.

Finally, if neither side has weak groups, that is the time to look for the largest moves.  The final score in go is determined by territory, but paradoxically, simply grabbing for territory is the least effective way to get it.  Attack from a position of strength to keep sente and make small, steady gains.

Good luck, play strong.

C[Managing to live on both sides and keeping him heavy looks like a great success for me, but this position was too hard for me to really analyze. I wonder if he could have beaten me up here.]
;W[lo];B[mq];W[be]C[Here he started the endgame too early and I get a chance to hunt his weak group to death. Still, I think I could have gotten into heavy trouble on the right side, if my opponent had grabbed the opportunity. Was my strategy or tactic lacking somewhere?]
