C[This was a game played pretty late at night -- I was tired and made a couple obviously bad plays, but white made at least a few mistakes as well.

I was "wrex" playing black.

The entire game revolved around two weak white groups that black chased all over the board.  This made for a more aggressive game than I usually play.   Unfortunately, black made almost no profit with all this chasing.

I'm looking for advice on how I could have taken better advantage of the situation.


yip:
Both sides made some large strategic mistakes in this game.  Always try to keep in mind what moves help to make territory - both in the short term and the longer term.  While attacking the opponent may prevent her from building a moyo, you need to be sure that your own groups don't suffer in the process.

In addition, it's important to realize which groups are strong and which are weak.  Just because a group has one eye, and needs to make another doesn't mean it's worth attacking relentlessly.  Try building strength elsewhere first, then go for the kill later if it's still vulnerable.]

(;B[ic]LB[fe:A]C[This attachment was kind of an experiment.  This kind of high pincer by white surprised me.  I wasn't sure what would be the best  response, but this seemed reasonable.


yip:
This isn't a great followup for black.  Just entering at the 3-3 point is probably reasonable (variation).  The other standard response is at A, though that doesn't seem as good heresince it would left white develop a bit more effectively on the left and upper sides.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[ec]C[yip:
This move seems a bit odd after pushing at the top.  White has already strengthened black's group, and G16 is still an important point for black's shape.  If white wanted territory in the corner, it would have been better to not even play H16.]
;B[gd];W[eb]C[yip:
Another odd move by white, whose focus seems to have switched from influence (with the high pincer and push) to getting the corner territory.  Now the two white stones are just a burden.]
;B[fb]C[yip:
Not a good play.  This has no effect on the corner, and the top is still wide open.  The black group is hardly in danger here.  K16 would be better, as it would help secure the top, and basically neutralize the two white stones.]
;W[cf]C[yip:
Relatively small at this point.  Black certainly can't invade the corner, so this makes little difference in territory.]
;B[jd];W[if]C[yip:
This is a bad play.  The two white stones are serving no purpose whatsoever - why bother saving them?  This makes no territory, and only gives black a bigger target for attack.]
;B[hf]C[I was VERY happy with both the local and global situation at this point.


yip:
White probably should have had the better of it, but made a pair of slow moves.  Black seems to have the better position overall at this point, particularly given that white has only played on the left side (the weak stones nonwithstanding).]
;W[je];B[ie]C[yip:
This should be left unplayed - white H15 makes G14 a cutting point afterwards.  Just play G15 directly, and force white to connect]
;W[he];B[ge];W[ie]
(;B[ke]C[yip:
Black is trying too hard here.  Look at the cutting points in the position, and realize how thin it actually is.  Also picture H15 not being there as a result of not throwing in at J15 previously.]
;W[hg];B[gf]C[Black still seems well ahead to me...]
(;W[jg]C[yip:
This just seems odd.  It's not clear how white is planning on escaping or making eyes here.]
;B[kf]C[yip:
Black is leaving cutting points behind again in eagerness for a kill.  Just playing L16 (or M15) would still force white to defend, and secure a huge upper side.

White is still able to run away easily here - black doesn't have any thickness to chase white towards.]

(;B[lj]LB[li:A]C[I considered A, but since both of white's groups were so weak, I thought the faster two-space extension was better.  Mistake?


yip:
First, realize that white L12 isn't a threat right now, since the ladder works, so there's nothing to defend against.  That being said, white won't be making eyes with the J15 group, so the best chance it has is escaping.  J11 looks nice, since it helps to cut white off from the bottom, and is a much more direct threat.  M10 doesn't really threaten either group (nor would M11).]
;W[qc]TR[kd][ld][le][lf][mf][ng]C[I was happy to play let white have the corner as long as he was kept isolated and black became thick -- just made the the marked group even weaker, right?


yip:
True, but consider the direction the wall should be facing.  By blocking at Q17, black ends up getting overconcentrated with the stones already played at the top.]

(;B[nc]C[yip:
I don't believe this move is necessary with the stones at O15 helping.]
;W[ni];B[ih]C[yip:
This move does little but encourage white to connect.  It also forces the two black stones into a shortage of liberties afterwards.]
;W[ig];B[fh]C[yip:
The black stones in the middle are not strong - this move induces white to encircle them, which is hardly what black wants.]
;W[gi];B[oh];W[nh]C["strengthen the weaker group when fighting", so....


yip:
Except that the weaker group is the black one in the middle!  Black is strengthening white's stones by forcing them to connect and extend.  With each move, the black stones in the center look more and more isolated.]
;B[ij]
(;W[kh]C[yip:
This is a bit too aggressive on white's part.  It would be better to leave the potential there, and aim for it later with some more subtle moves.  O9 or something else is more urgent, if white insists on saving those stones.  Otherwise, F11 is good, since it practically ensures the other group's safety.]

(;B[fi]LB[jp:A][iq:B][kq:C]C[Okay the group on the right is (almost?) alive with no profit, but my groups are at least fairly strong.

I debated between something around A/B/C or the played stone.  I thought playing the way I did would let me play on the bottom fairly naturally.  I was right, but it didn't really help.


yip:
The group on the right's not alive yet...S7 is the vital point.

F11 seems like an act of frustration - black insists on killing a white group.  It doesn't make any territory at all - and neither would white playing there.  It doesn't really restrict white from making territory, either, aside from forcing a play to extend into the center.  So what's the purpose of it?

Looking at territory, black doesn't need much to stay even with white (particularly given that even if black doesn't think white can be killed in the lower left, at least T3 is sente, to get a large corner).  The upper left is maybe 20 points, and the upper right perhaps 5-7.  There are a few in other spots, but overall, black only needs about 30-40 points at the bottom for a comfortable position.  Simply approaching around F3 seems fine; black has excellent followups to get the entire bottom, or dismantle any potential white has on the left.  

In addition, if white does play along the left side in response, then F11 becomes more effective - now it's more of a beachhead to invade white's area.  Playing it beforehand means that white can respond more efficiently as a result.]
;W[hj];B[jp];W[lq]C[This seemed WAY too deep for white to invade to me, but I wasn't sure how to punish for it.


yip:
Definitely too deep.  Simply holding back around G3 would be fine, since black wouldn't be able to develop much at all, as well as leaving room for sliding further.]

(;B[fk]LB[rq:A]C[I remember I consciously chose to leave the obvious cut at A to play this.

I realized that black wasn't making much territory.  So I focussed on the weakest white group I could find.  I wasn't actually trying to kill the group -- just wanted to use this to make some territory on the left somehow.


yip:
What territory is there going to be on the left?  White has a solid position in the upper left, and another stone in the lower left.  The black stones are hardly in a position to make territory there.  Even if the white group in the center is harrassed slightly, black still has too many moves to get anything there.

Approaching the corner at F3 would be much bigger, since the white group on the bottom is far from safe, but can run towards the corner.]
;W[gk];B[ik]C[yip:
What does this move do?  White lives with G12 at any time, so it's hardly a threat.  Nor does it make any territory or thickness.]
;W[hl];B[hk]TR[ij][ik]C[yip:
Again, it's not clear what black is doing.  The three stones are ending up short of liberties now, while white has no problem living or escaping.]
;W[fl]C[yip:
Now the white stones look like they're working together.  The weak white stones at the bottom don't have to flee far now, while the lower left is actually starting to resemble a moyo...]
;B[gh];W[fj];B[ek]TR[fk]C[yip:
Black still seems determined to capture the entire center group, but it's an unreasonable attempt.  Can white really be prevented from connecting with the other stones or living?  If it's impossible to stop, then what purpose are the marked stones serving?]

yip:
C5 is much bigger.  The black stones on the left aren't that strong right now, either, and get much weaker after white plays C12 (which would also be a better point than D13 for black).]
;W[ch];B[ck]C[yip:

There are a few large endgame points left (F6 not being one of them).  L18 could have actually been a major threat before white F14, since it would sever the two black groups.  The black group in the center can still be harrassed as well.]
