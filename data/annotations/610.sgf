Comments by Allan Wickberg (allan 17k* @ IGS), May 1998.

(Being 17k*, my analysis may very well frequently be incorrect, so comments on my comments are welcome to allan.b.wickberg@telia.se)

I commented on some of Allan's comments (Arno Hollosi (dada), Austrian 1kyu).]
;B[ld]C[allan: Very confident first move. I have been given the advice that the first 20 moves or so should be on or below the third line. It makes sense, since it is much easier to get a base for ones groups if they are closer to the border. With a good foundation, it is easier to attack later.

dada: 4th line is good too (for fast development).];W[qc];B[dq]
;W[pp];B[oc];W[pe];B[pc]C[allan: I think it is more important build in the other direction; if white would play o17, or something, now, things could get pretty messy. A move somewhere along the line between m16 and d16 would be reasonable.

dada: o17 isn't too good either. Just play at the upper left empty corner.
Corners are very big. A good advice for fuseki is: corner - side - center (playing in that order)]
;W[qd];B[pd]C[allan: Now black is getting heavy here, and b q16 also creates an "open triangle", which is an unefficient formation (low liberties/stone ratio).]
;W[oe]C[allan: White takes advantage of blacks triangle and prevents b p15. Black has to defend the group now, instead of attacking white.]
;B[qb]C[allan: This feels like the wrong direction. To defend the group, black has to connect to m16. b o16 or o17 seems reasonable.]
;W[qg]C[allan: white saves the attack for later and builds some territory instead.]
;B[qn]C[allan: The q17 group is still too vulnerable to allow play elsewhere, in my opinion. First build strength, then attack.

dada: black should consider playing in the upper left corner instead.]
;W[ql]C[allan: This pincer is perfect; extends white's side, and threatening black's stone at the same time.]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[rp];W[ro];B[sp]C[allan: Unusual, but not necessarily bad - I think the more common play of b s3 (w r5, b o2, w n3, b elsewhere) here still leaves some possibilities ("aji") for later.]
;W[so];B[rq];W[qo];B[on]C[allan: Black runs, which is perfectly in order

dada: running looks a little bit too early to me. Again the upper left corner is the place to play.]
;W[no];B[nr]C[allan: Another move is required for the r6 and p6 stones to still have the chance if escaping. This way black induces more strength in the white group, thus weakening r6/p6. A move like b q9/p8/o7 or something like that would be proper.
The black corner is alive anyway.];W[mq];B[mr]C[allan: See previous comment. There is not much territorial gain for black here, either.]
;W[ol];B[pm]C[allan: This move is making the black stones heavy. There is no room for eyes here; black has to run out into the board, possibly losing r6.
Draw a line between p8 and o5; that is what black has to cross.

dada: right - though running is futile at the moment (the W q4 group is in no danger). Thus B should play elsewhere.]
;W[pl];B[om]C[allan: Black is still "below" the line between p8 and o5. Needs to cross.]
;W[ml]C[allan: Probably too late for black to escape now - white's play is pretty solid.]
;B[mm];W[ll]C[allan: White does not try too hard to kill. He wants black to keep running, so he can build a large moyo while chasing the black stones.]
;B[dd]C[allan: So it is probably smart by black to try something else for now. The p8 stones could prove useful later even if they get killed in the end.]
;W[kq];B[iq]C[allan: Right idea - white was claiming a huge area down here, so something had to be done. The rule "play away from thickness" may suggest a stepwise approach to strong enemy stones. Perhaps h3 or g3 would have been better.

dada: right - if you play on the lower side you should play at g3.
However one should consider playing around C10 - B building his own moyo.]
;W[co];B[cq]C[allan: This feels a little too defensive. I would have tried a pincer at c7, giving a natural reason to play f4 next, if white answers with e5. That would make the lower stones safe, and giving the opportunity to push into white's domain with something like j5.]
;W[eo];B[dj]C[allan: Black needs something like f4 to secure the lower group]
;W[fq]C[allan: Now white have split black into two weak groups, attacking both at once.]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[er];W[gp];B[hq];W[gq]C[allan: Very solid play by white. It will be hard for the j3 group to live now.]
;B[eq]C[allan: Yes, the corner group needs another stone to be safe, but it should rather be b3 or b4. w b2 now would be inconvenient.]
;W[ep]C[allan: White reinforces his fence, and black still has to play one more stone in the corner.]
;B[bp]C[allan: In general, fighting makes both sides grow locally stronger, removing the potential of breakthroughs later. This is something stronger players avoid; I think it is called "aji-keshi". It is always a balance between safety and tempo. Black could have secured the corner group with b4 (whithout playing e3), leaving white to either seal the gap, or going elsewhere. In the former case, white would lose tempo, and in the latter case, black would still have some "aji" around e4 to exploit later.

Take the opportunity to observe games between strong players; they keep things unresolved until the last minute, to have as many options open as possible until the very end.]
;W[cf]C[allan: If white kills the surrounded black stones, he has about 40+ points of territory in the lower half of the board, and even more along the right side. White does not worry about b b6, but instead tries to destroy black's potential in the northwest.]
;B[cd]C[allan: Again, I think this is too defensive. The black stone at d10 looks pretty lonely now. A pincer at c12 would induce w e14, or c17, either way strengthening blacks area on top as well as the middle stone.]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[dh];B[di]C[allan: Here black makes an open triangle again. Also, playing many stones in a small area makes them heavy without creating eye space. Something like c8 is needed to make  a base for black, because there is no good place to run; white is strong in the center, too.]
;W[fh];B[kf]C[allan: Black needs to dent white's potential territory alright, but the first priority is to keep the weakest group alive. (That is "weak", not "doomed":) Another move to secure the d11 group is needed.

dada: right - if B plays on the upper side he should play around f16.]
;W[cl]C[allan: The d11 group now has no base, and no good place to run. It is not over yet, but the prospects are not too bright for black now.]
;B[fj];W[fd]C[allan: The situation for black is hopeless at this point; I have a hard time commenting on the remaining moves, since I have no clue of what to do about it. White dominates the board, and except  for the lower corners, black has nothing but weak groups.]
