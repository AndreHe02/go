C[A lot of thanks for reviewing my game. I am Comsaint, who played Black in this game. The game was close till the end, where I made a mistake and lost.
 I have got a couple of questions to ask:
1. Is the choice of joseki from 11 to 27 right?
2. How should I respond to W34?
3. What do you think I need to improve most?

Thanks again for reviewing! Please give any comment you like.

reid: IMO, most amatuers don't give enough thought to the early part of the game.  It is very encouraging to me that your questions are about that part of the game.

Of course, it is also the most difficult part to analyze deeply.  Pros spend inordinate amounts of time on the opening, both during tournament games, and also during their study.  But for those of us who do no aspire to be professionals, there is still much to be gained from striving for solid foundations in the opening.  And for our level, it is not all that difficult.  The main thing to keep in mind is that your stones need to work together.  I will try to focus on that as we explore your game.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[pn];B[op]C[reid: this is interesting.  I have not seen it before.  Often one sees a pincer here - black denies white an easy base as he tries to make use of the K4 stone.  While it looks difficult for white to answer this kosumi immediately, I would be concerned (as black) for the weak extension between K4 and P4.  P4 is certainly territorial in nature, so leaving an easy invasion for white seems like it could be a problem.

EDIT: My teacher, Jiang Ming Jiu 7P, says that black Q4 is a way (meaning that it is not a mistake).  See variation for normal continuation.]

(;W[qf]LB[qj:A]C[reid: This looks like an overplay by white.  Of course, black will split these two white stones.  Since black Q16 is on the four-four, it is a moyo-type move, and so it seems white could patiently extend to around A (R10) to disturb black's overall positional balance.

EDIT: see the variation on the previous move - A is one line too far.]
;B[qh]LB[of:B][pj:A]C[reid: But I don't think this is the best place for black to pincer.  It is severe on the R14 stone, but doesn't really do anything with respect to the larger potential target, Q6.  I think black A Q10) would be more difficult for white to handle.  It destroys white's natural extensions on both sides, and if white jumps out to B, black Q10 is not damaged as much as black R12 is (because it's further away).]
;W[of];B[nd];W[pi]LB[qk:A]C[reid: Here we see the problem with black R12.  All the normal josekis from this position result in white getting a strong position that is well placed to damage black's investment on the lower side.

EDIT: Ming-Jiu suggests that white A is good.  Note that A is the completion of the normal continuation (variation a few moves ago), as well as being a nice pincer.  Not also that a white invasion in the corner at R17 is still an option.]
;B[ph]LB[de:G][qe:A][rf:C][qg:D][rg:E][rh:F][qi:B]C[EDIT: Ming-jiu suggests the joseki at black A (instead of Q12), white blocks at B, white C through black F, then black gets sente to approach the upper left corner first with G.]
;W[oh];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[pk];B[ql];W[om]LB[og:A][pl:B][pm:F]
[qm:C][qn:G][po:H][qp:D][qq:E]C[reid: To here is joseki.  But there are a few things to take note of.  First, white has Q6 already in place -  perhaps white could do something other than P7?  In any case, Q6 means that black's position is a bit worse than joseki.  Second, while black can cut starting at A (P13), it's not nearly as big as it seems because white can still live in the corner.  In exchange for the territory on the right side (S11, etc), black has allowed white to build thickness that is well placed for reducing black's bottom area (M3, etc).  So I don't think black has succeeded in taking advantage of white's overplay at R14.

EDIT: Ming-jui suggests that white can use Q6 more effectively by pressing hard with B instead of P7.  The pattern might continue with black C through white H, making black very low on the side while white gets some brutal thickness.]
;B[og];W[ng];B[pg];W[nh];B[pf];W[hq]LB[de:A]C[EDIT: Ming-jiu: White should play at A instead.]
;B[jq]LB[cp:H][ep:G][hp:A][cq:C][dq:B][eq:E][cr:D][dr:F]C[reid: So far, black seems to be ahead territorially, while white has supperior thickness.  I think black would do better to try to match (oppose) white's thickness while keeping his territorial lead, rather than trying to grab more territory.  Black A (H4) seems like better balance.

EDIT: Ming-jiu suggests black B, to which white will respond at C.  If next black G, it is a ko after black F, but black has no ko threates at this time, so instead black continues with D through black H.  Black steals away white's corner.]

(;W[dr]LB[fp:A]C[EDIT: white A is better.  See variation.];B[ch]
LB[de:B][hp:A]C[reid: The proverb says "play the urgent move, not the big move".  Areas that are unsettled are urgent.  I think black should still play at A to settle this area before embarking on a new venture with C12.  If black keeps sente after A, and manages to get some thickness in this area, then black B (D15) looks more interesting than C12.  (after black is thick around A, white cannot expect much territory in the C9 area).

EDIT: Ming-jiu: Black can just play at B now instead of C12.]
;W[ce];B[ck];W[lc]LB[fc:E][pc:C][id:A][le:D][me:B]C[Comsaint:: 2. How should I respond to W34?

reid: Yes, W34 looks like a good move.  White has good follow-ups at A (J16) and B (N15).  However, it is less urgent than if might seem in that white still has the 3-3 invasion potential.

Edit: Ming-jiu: Since the corner is still open to invasion (white R17), black should pincer at A.  After white jumps out to D, black can make a base with E.

Only to move 34, but already there is a lot to study in this game.  I think this was a very good game to illustrate some of the principles of the early part of the game.  I hope you will be able to build on this information, and defeat your opponents before they even know what hit them!

Good luck, play strong,  reid.];B[jc];W[hc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le]
