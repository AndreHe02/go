Thanks for the chance to comment your game. 

Only a high ranking pro can know the truth about go. Amateur dans like myself merely contribute additional random ideas. Their value is only to stimulate your thinking so you can enjoy the game more.

July 2004];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[kc]C[W6: a bit slow. It is a reducer move only because black can easily come into a six line extension.]
;B[jp]C[B7: 4th line to build moyo. Correct.];W[np]C[W8: Too early. White is not patient.]
;B[nq]C[B9: Unfortunate. 

Don't attach to a weak stone. O4 is certainly weak since it is already pincered. The proper play is Q6 to continue to pressure O4 and move the inside corner stone out.

If you want to be really aggressive then experiment with P6, 5th line pressure making the right bigger than normal.

In general contact is for defense. Here black is attacking with contact, a bad idea usually.]
;W[oq]C[W10: No need for White to contribute a stone.];B[op]
;W[mq];B[nr];W[mp];B[mr];W[lr];B[or];W[kq]C[Now K4 is meaningless. Black has lost ground.]
;B[cn];W[gq]C[W20: too low and close to the strong White stones. As White I would find C8 or E5 interesting here.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[iq]C[W24: unbearably slow. Now black has recovered from his earlier loss because it appears that K4 has become a forcing move instead of a useless stone.]
;B[fc]C[Would N17 and then C17 invasion be better?

No, F17 is usually proper when white has a 6 line extension. Unlike 5 lines, it is easy to come in and settle right away.]
;W[hc]C[W26: overconcentrated.];B[cc]C[B27: you may consider to contact for defense at H16 immediately, since the two White stones can be considered strong so you dont mind making them stronger and getting in a forcing move.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]C[B35: you can observe that if L17 were not there, but White next played that move, it would be a poor extension from his strong outside group. This shows is evidence that H17 was not the best. 

Black is flat on the left but still has good money compared with the overconcetrated upper White position.]
;W[eg]C[W36: a typical forcing move in this shape, but it loses the chance of C12 later.]
;B[nc]C[B37: the honest move is C13 preventing a White forcing move there, which White may do immediately.]
;W[qf]C[W38: usually S15 is the pivotal point.];B[qe]C[B39: Instead, R16 doesn't touch white and is better for securing the corner. Of course you want to make the white stone heavy, okay. It is the exceptiion to attacking with contact.]
;W[qm];B[pf]C[B41: key local point, but R5 is valuable and keeps up the pressure on all fronts. Then White can have two weak situations to deal with. This way White got two moves in the lower right as compensation. So I think B41 is slack. If the strong upper Black position could be used to develop the top, perhaps B41 would be very good; but here the top is done.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[rq];B[qk];W[ph];B[oh]C[B46: too tight.  Attack the whole thing with O11 which helps your middle stones too. The knight move is a classic atacking play. Push him into your strong upper right corner position while he runs for his life and you benefit outside and erase much of the his thickness.]
;W[og];B[pg];W[oi];B[qh]C[B51: Black secures about 10 points but White gets a ponnuki. Black has lost ground. The ponnuk is great with White's thickness.]
;W[nh];B[pi];W[qr];B[pr];W[qp];B[pq];W[po];B[oo];W[pn];B[dh]
C[B61: thin. B61 at C13 instead removes bad aji. This will turn out to be a losing move.]
;W[fi];B[id];W[ic]C[W64: since white answered inside J16 was a good forcing move.White may have tried L15 to eat big.

How should black handle the white thickness? It is not easy because white got that ponnuki on the right.

The big door line is in the middle and White is strong. Just go slightly outside it then. K10 perhaps or J10?]
;B[kd];W[ld];B[jc]C[B67: heavy. M15 could be a flexible reduction. In a sabaki situation also be aware of cross cut and double hane. Reading determines which is better. These stones unite into a clump too expensive to sacrifice to get outside forcing moves.]
;W[jb];B[jd];W[lc]
(;B[hd]C[B71: more heavy than a grand piano -- since it isn't sente.]
;W[lf]C[Black is deservedly in trouble.];B[ig];W[ii];B[kf]C[B75: contact for defense. Must survive or resign. But suvival, while the best result, is still a bleak result overall.]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[jh]C[White creates a shiney new moyo, so gets a benefit from pressing the heavy black group.]
;B[hi];W[hj];B[gg];W[hf]C[W82: too deep. H12 may be good enough to bother black.]
;B[gf];W[gi];B[le];W[me];B[ke];W[md];B[ie]C[B89: so lived in gote and destroyed some top, but another one appears in the center! Black has not accomplished much.

Would G17 be better than J15?];W[nm]C[So white benefits from his attack on the heavy black stones on top by reinforcing the new moyo.]
;B[nk];W[mk];B[nn];W[mn];B[mm];W[ml];B[lm];W[no];B[nl];W[on]
;B[mj];W[lk];B[lj];W[kk];B[oj]C[B105: better to reduce from the big door around F7]
;W[fm];B[en];W[fn];B[eo];W[fp];B[kj];W[jj];B[ek];W[fk];B[bq]
;W[cr];B[mb];W[gb];B[gc];W[hb];B[hh]

;W[di];B[ci];W[cg]C[W134: trouble for Black.];B[ce];W[ch];B[fo]
;W[go];B[dj];W[ei];B[br];W[bs];B[em];W[fl];B[ep];W[eq];B[ql]
;W[rn];B[lb];W[kb];B[bi];W[bg];B[df];W[dg];B[mf]C[B155: now White can play into the top left corner in sente instead of saving an unimportant stone.

crazyd:

1. Don't use contact for attack usually.
2. Don't attack on too small a scale.
3. Don't give your opponent an outside ponnuki unless he buys you a new car.
