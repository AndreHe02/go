C[i have two questions, first i would like to know my overplayes in the game, i and i though i had alot of them, and i would like to know better plays i could have made instead of them.

djna: My comments are prefixed like this. I hope I answered you questions.

Interesting game.];B[qd]C[Junko3 [9k\]: hi

djna: Normally W should play the empty corner. I don't see a good reason to play this.]
;B[cp]LB[pf:A][dp:B]C[djna: W can get thickness in the top right by playing A. 
Black should consider playing B so he also gets thickness.]
;W[qo]C[djna: getting complex, two corners are now unresolved]
;B[qk]LB[oe:A]C[djna: reasonable idea - I wonder whether playing  first might be interesting, should result in some support for the pincer.]

;W[eq]TR[qe][qf][qg]C[secondly i would like to know if the S6 group is alive or not

djna: See variation. As far as I can see W is dead and has conceded a large corner to B.
One issue though is that W moves in the marked area may threaten to allow W to live, so W does have some potential.]

(;B[hq]TR[dn][do]C[
djna: you ask about overplays. I think that this is an overplay, B is playing in the shadow of W's strong group.

I would just allow W to have the lower side, answering on the left, B can build nearly as quickly as EW and has spent far fewer stones.]
;W[hp]LB[cn:B][eo:A][ho:C]C[
djna usually contact plays are used when you need to settle a weak group. Here W is strong, so this is probably bad. A simple sequence such as A, B, C may be better.

Just ask B to show how he intends to live W should get a lot of thickness.]

[fo][cp][fp][gp][fq]C[
djna: observe the result, B lives in an unreasonable place so W gets strength on the outsideand puts severe pressure on the marked stones. This is a bad result for B.]

djna: this seems like a good idea for W, maybe the variation is better]

djna: it's annoying for W that B gets first move, but even so W does OK]
;W[em];B[fm];W[dk]LB[ic:C][ld:B][ce:A]TR[fl][fm][fn][fo][fp]
[gp][fq]C[
djna: B must now decide whether to set the marked group in motion.

If he can get a strong attack on W's centre group then he may be OK. The danger is that W will get a lot of territory from attacking B.

An alternative approach is to play somewhere else, for example A, B or C (I like B)
The idea is that W should not be able to captue the marked group *and* make a large territory somewhere else.]
;B[hk]C[
djna: B needs to find a forceful attack on W 

I've looked at a number of alternatives but failde to find a better move.

The result doesn't seem great for B, so would prefer to play elsewhere]
;W[ik];B[fj];W[di];B[ij];W[jk];B[jj];W[hl];B[gk];W[de]C[
djna this is frustrating for B, W has taken sente, his centre group is too resilient.

B just has a centre group with no apparent purpose.]
(;B[cg]C[

djna: I thought that this was an overplay.

How do we decide? The rule is that if you have two weak groups on the board then you have a problem. Obviously the invasion B played makes a new group, and it's in W's sphere of influence so it *should* be weak.

The B cengtre group still has no eyes, so it's a bit weak, but it's pressing on an rather week W group, so maybe it's not too weak

Sometimes we need to play desperate moves because we are losing.

On balance I think that this *is* an overplay. I think with correct play from W black will suffer. But it gets complicated, and complications are fun.]

djna: horrible result for W, B's weak group is transformed into territory and powere.]

;W[qh];B[ph];W[rf];B[qi];W[qc]C[
djna: bad result, so now B needs to decie how much to take from W at the top.]

djna: good idea to build some strength first];B[jl]C[
djna: wastes a ko threat];W[hn];B[hc]LB[id:A][he:B]C[
djna: very deep. Often a contact play such as A is better when invading into string terrtory.

My instinct is that reducing at B is the "correct play, but I think that black would lose playing correctly.

So it's an overplay, but may win the game,];W[ic];B[he];W[if]
;B[hf];W[hg]LB[he:B][ig:A]TR[hc]C[
djna: I wonder whetehr W at A instead would give a better result. I think this is the point when W lost the game.

I feel that B is getting away with something here.

I don't think that we  (the players or me) could expect to read out all the variations, so all I can say is that after this W has too many weaknesses and it was always likely that B could find an effective move.

The "take home" message here is that this kind of invasion is unpredicatable.
We should only play it in the following cases

1). We have strong confidence it works - perhaps we have found a clever sequence.

2). We *know* that we will lose if we play correctly, so we are playing an incorrect move that may work, and may let us rescue a losing game. This means that we need to be able to estimate the score. 

So the question is: when B played the marked move had he rejected a reducing move such as B because he assessed the score. If he did that then the invasion was a good move.]
