C[In the game I find i have trouble responsing corrently when my opponent attack me. Please help me improve my fighting skill.

P: 

Hi, I'm Paul, a 3k. I hope you find this helpful.

I think the issue isn't your opponent attacking you, but you overextending and leaving cutting points when you attack your opponent. If you want to get better at fighting, always keep in mind two things:

1) attack from a distance, not up close. If it feels like you are trying to wrap your stones around the opponent's group, stop, reconsider what you are doing.

2) play solidly, don't leave troublesome cutting points unless you can clearly read out a capture

I put comments throughout the game, but here's what I think the main lesson to be learned from the game is:

you make stronger what you attack, so pay attention to which direction you attack a group from. Are you pushing it up against one of your weak groups that you will later have to defend, or against a solid group? 

In the game, you attack white's group on the bottom from the right side, and white - growing bigger and stronger everytime you pressure it from the right - cuts and captures on the left. This is the curse of the overeager attacking style. You fight and fight, and the whole time put yourself at a disadvantage somewhere else on the board.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[ce];W[cd]C[Should I response with D15?

P: 

Yes. In this kind of shape extending like at d15 is always good. Here it is necessary.]

(;W[fc];B[cn];W[cl]C[I am lost on how to response here

P: going into the corner is correct, but you play the joseki incorrectly. You should learn the proper joseki by heart. You will play it many times in the future.]

(;B[fr];W[ep]C[You have to play at e2. It is urgent. Sometimes it makes sense to tenuki and go make a big move. Especially in the high double digit kyus this is often a good strategy. But here it is too dangerous for your corner.]

(;B[iq]C[What does this move do? Not much territory to be made here. If you want something big take something like r9, q9, r5, q5]
;W[er]C[And what you would expect to happen happens. So why throw away a stone when you will need to respond to it to protect your corner?]

(;B[nq];W[pl]
(;B[nj];W[rp]C[White tries to make a base here and it works out poorly. White gives black a number of stones that emanate strength toward the top right for... A couple points? Not worth it. Black handled this well.]
;B[rq];W[rk];B[rj];W[qk];B[qj];W[qp];B[qq]C[This sequence was bad for white. Whatever points they encloses, they gave you back (and more!) in the bottom right corner and the top right.]
;W[lq]C[How should i response here?

P:

Let's break this down into simpler questions, not necessarily yours, but channeling what someone might think in this situation.

What is white doing here?

You gave white a big fat wall and he is pushing your stone into it

He's invading my territory, how do I stop him?

He is not invading your territory. That area was not yours. 

Yeah, but how do I kill it?

You can't kill it.

Then what do I want to get out of my next moves?

You want your stone at j3 to be safe and you want sente so you can play in the top right at p17 or o1

How do I make sure my j3 stone is safe?

You run him out into the center

Your move at o5 would be good if the white group were just a bit weaker and needed to respond to that move on the right, as opposed to continuing to attack your stone at j3. Who knows, maybe you could throw in and kill the group after o5, but it would be tricky, and even if you kept him to one eye he would probably break into the center.

Best to just keep it simple. Jump out into the center with j5. White will have to respond by moving out, too. Having a solid group of stones also helps you down the line by making your c6 stone peskier.]

(;B[no];W[jp];B[ip];W[mp];B[np]
(;W[jq]C[A mistake. White is taking the pressure off your black stones on the bottom left.

You respond by making your stones on the left weaker by attacking from the other side. If you are sure you can kill that white group with a throw in this would make sense, but it is better to move out with your black stones at j4]

(;B[ln];W[lo]C[Another mistake from white. In situations like this for white, the impulse needs to be to break out toward the center.

Black should be feeling the same thing for his j3 stones]
(;B[mn]C[P: Timid. Could extend in other direction. Best to just run wihh the j3 stones, though.]
;W[ko];B[jn];W[kn];B[km];W[io]C[Good];B[in]
(;W[jo];B[ho]C[P: this move says "i still think I can kill your group." Take a look at all the cutting points: m7, k7, h6, h4

You are stretched thin. When it gets like this while you are attacking it will typically backfire.]

(;W[hp]C[White would be better off cutting from the other side]
;B[go];W[gp]
(;B[en]C[Too thin. You can't connect everything so easily. Black cuts you to pieces.]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[gn]
(;B[hn];W[gm]C[Ouch. This is not going to be easy for black]
;B[eo]C[Unreasonable];W[jm];B[jl];W[im]C[From here i got into a messy fight and i am not able to get out of it.

P: 

You had a chance later to save your stones because of mistakes by white, but in general you put yourself in this position way back by fighting too directly, trying to wrap around white's stones.

Remember: attack from a distance];B[fp];W[hm];B[fo]
(;W[bn]C[Unnecessary];B[el]

;W[fo];B[fn];W[en];B[fm];W[em]C[P:

Maybe something like this happens. You cede a lot of territory at the bottom and the left, but look at the top right. You'll get some territory out of that. And you should throw into that white group: you have a decent shot and killing it entirely, since it cannot escape. So, on the whole: not terrible to be black in this situation]

(;W[ep];B[fq]C[This is a very common position. White gets nothing from pushing at e3 and cutting. Black has a good move at f4 and the stone at c6 can make like difficult for white later. In this position, white can solidify their position with d6, if they are worried abiut the c6 stone, or play at g5, threatening a move at g3. Often, though, it just gets left like this at the beginning of a game.]
