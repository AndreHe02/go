Maybe  I  actually didn't have a solid game at the begin, but it was 
how I feel my game.

Hello,

my name is Ulrich (pmurk65 on IGS 13k, KGS around 10k) and I will 
review your game. My comments will start with Ulrich.
Hope you can benefit from my comments. Please keep in mind that I am 
far from being a master: stronger players might comment different.
You can contact me at pmurk.go@googlemail.com


I try to summarize:
- You got the basics of the game quite well.
- You lost be loosing a big group. Do not be sad about this. Happens to me quite often: do go problems to become better in reading
- Try to balance your play following the simple 3 step check: protect, attack, make territory
- You made some weak moves like D10. With better reading skills you will avoid them and become stronger.]
;W[qp];B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[kq]MA[jp][jq]C[Ulrich: Up to this 
point standard. L3 is a little slow ("play away from strength", O3/4 have enough influence to extend
 1 move further (crossed points). See brugo.be for example.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[hd];B[fd];W[db];B[ff]C[This Maybe are really rare moves,
 I'm not sure, but I want to play it.

Ulrich: I feel this is too high for the moment. W can push along 3rd or 4rth line and your stone miss a base.]
;W[cf];B[dc];W[cc];B[eb]
(;W[cb]
(;B[jd];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[ic];W[kd];B[je]C[Is this a good
 move in this situation?

Ulrich: Looks good to me as - if you both run into the middle - you are
 ahead and can continue like shown.]
(;W[qk];B[qi];W[qb];B[nd];W[pc];B[qd];W[mc]SQ[qg]MA[cj][cm]
[cn][gq]C[Ulrich: At this point it seems is valuable for me to evaluate the board: 
a) Any weak groups from you? D4 and R13 (which you learned later is an 
invitation for reduction
b) Any white groups that can be attacked?
c) Is N16 (your next move) the biggest move or are there bigger moves.

This evaluation follows a simple logic: 
a) First: protect your own weakness
b) Second: attack your oponent
c) Third: make territory];B[md]CR[qh][oi][pi][cj][cm][cn][fp]
[fq][gq]C[ulrich: not the right place for the time beeing.
Alternatives are marked];W[qg]
(;B[pg];W[qh];B[ph];W[ri]
(;B[pj]C[A move in R10 would be better than this?

Ulrich: see comment at the end of the variation];W[qj];B[pi]
;W[ke];B[if]SQ[jf]C[Ulrich: 
- If you want to play here locally - K14 seems sronger to me.
- Still I feel the lower left is more urgent];W[jp]
(;B[gq]C[k3 was better for black?

Ulrich: I think K3 is better];W[jq];B[kp];W[ko];B[lo];W[ln]

(;B[mo];W[jn]C[Ulrich: not enough pressure on W I think];B[om]
TR[lo][mo][kp][np][op][kq][nq]C[Ulrich: following the proverb "play away from strength" this is
 not a good spot to continue. The marked group will live I think and W 
K4 group can not be attacked due to missing strength on the left side.]
;W[pl];B[ol]C[Ulrich: Check again
a) any weakness in your own groups?
b) can you attack W?
c) extend your territory

I would play aroudn C9 or so.
Even C4 is good];W[cq]C[How should I answer that?

Ulrich: Your response is in my reading one of the correct choices.
The corner was still open, see my comment in move 58];B[cp]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[bq]C[This move was bad I
 think, maybe g2 was the right move. :S

Ulrich: I think G2 is better];W[br];B[bo];W[aq];B[bp];W[gr]

(;B[ap]C[Ulrich: too slow. I have shown some alternatives];W[ar]
;B[cr]C[This was stupid for 
sure. I already have been reading and It was useless, but I dunno why I
 decide to play it anyway.

Ulrich C2 is only good as a ko thread and should be saved. Alone it is 
not good.];W[dr];B[io];W[jo];B[hq];W[kr];B[mq];W[hr];B[lr];W[ir]
;B[en]C[Ulrich: too slow as to close to your onw strength: C10 / D10 is my 
choice];W[ci]
(;B[dj]C[Ulrich: a reviewer should be carefull about wrong moves but this one I think.

Look at the difference if you play C9]
(;W[kf]C[Ulrich: W can push further]
(;B[jf];W[fl]
(;B[el]C[Ulrich: try to avoid attaching lonly stone. It makes the lonly
 stone only stronger. D8 is much stronger.];W[bk]C[Ulrich: This is a severe attack from W.]

(;B[cj];W[bj]C[From this point I feel that I don't know what is a 
good move or a bad move :S

Ulrich: the effect of C10 is that you force W to become stronger locally. This of course is not good for you. I think you need to protect, I have tried something in the variation.]
;B[ei];W[ch];B[fk]C[Ulrich. Again: 
a) is there a weakness: protect first];W[cm]C[Ulrich: very painfull for B]
;B[em];W[lj]C[Ulrich: Huge move! KGS estimate around 15 point.

Why is this good? The stone can run up or down, therefore difficult to catch and REDUCES the influence of your Q-line stones.]
;B[ll];W[rc];B[rd];W[rb]
(;B[rf]C[Ulrich: I would thinking about making profit from the lonly M10 stone but the fight will be complicated. 
You should try this in a game sometimes.];W[pm];B[km];W[ok]

(;B[kn]C[Ulrich: I think around N13/N14 is a must as the group is not alive.]
;W[nk];B[pk];W[nh];B[ng]C[Ulrich: do not attach lonely stones - you only strengthen them as you can see in the next moves.]

(;B[sg]C[Well I think this was my worst play. R14 was needed.

Ulrich: correct];W[qf];B[qe]C[Ulrich: Q15 is a false eye, W T15 will kill the group]
;W[se];B[sd]C[Ulrich: a harsh lesson: if your group is dead, do not defend as you only throw away points.]
;W[ni]C[Ulrich: The game is over, I see nothing to turn it. My review ends here.]
