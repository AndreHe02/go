AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,
I will aprreciate every comment. especially on the opening and the fights on the bottom side which I survived wiht too much luck...
thank you very much
Ori

[DrK: Hi Ori. I will be your reviewer for this game focusing on the white side.

I note that when giving handicap games, white usually have the following strategic considerations - 

a. black's stones are on the star points and as such favors a strategy that focuses on influence (not that at our level that happens).
b. if black plays reasonably, white cannot expect to "quickly" gain an advantage. White should focus on playing good moves and gradually gain small advantages for a possible win at the end.
c. just because there are 2 extra stones, white should still focus on securing its own bases before considering methods of attack - not just invade - how about reduction and cuts?
d. it is especially importtant in handicap games to focus on keeping stones connected and keeping opponents' stones disconnected.
e. white's objective in the opening is (7k level) to have bases on the board; not be shut in; connect it's stones and disconnect opponent's stones.
With that in mind, let's look at the how white fares.\]];W[qp]

(;W[dk]C[[DrK: I prefer C10 or C9 - in this case black can force white to respond by attacking from under.\]]
;B[ch];W[ec]
(;B[dc];W[ed]C[I feel this is to small and slow. black could have answered G17 or H17  and I would have been in trouble.

[DrK: I expect a textbook pincer too - but no in this case black's best move is D17 if black knows how to follow up. I play out variation for G17 and H17 as well.\]]

(;B[qj]
(;W[qe]C[I thought I would like to come back and fix the left top corner but didnt want to be too slow.
I wanted to be able to catch the corner, but is this a good invasion?

[DrK: R15 has several issues:

1. Invasion is best when it is supported by other white stones in the area. 

2. It is not the most urgent move on the board. Making a good base for E17 should be more important - strengthen your own stones before attacking especially when you are giving handicap.

A move is slow if it can be ignored/does not cause much impact. Securing a group of stones to not be easily attacked is not usually slow.\]

(;W[qg];B[qm];W[nq]C[I didnt feel good about top and top right but again didnt want to stay behind

[DrK: Analysis - top right black is strong whereas white's groups are very thin. Otherwise it is a reasonable outcome for white - several bases on the board.\]]

(;B[dq];W[cp];B[jj]C[I was surprised by this move but it seamed good for black because the opening is harmonic and every group can try to use this stone.

[DrK: conclusion - white can work on:

a. playing lightly - some of white's groups become heavy; and
b. don't overlook defence - don't leave weakness in your groups - it limits your ability to attack.\]]
