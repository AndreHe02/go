C[        Hello !
   Before playing this game, I had already a losing feeling because in my head it's fermly written "I'm not 1dan, theses guys are scaring" (by the way I don't know how to manage that ^^), so maybe I have been passive some times and not at my better strength, but in the end the game was close so ...
  Anyway, I lost that game (I am black), and I would like to know if the game was well-balanced, where I did mistakes, especially how I could manage having points in the middle and reducing white's lower side. Thanks for any help, some more specific questions will follow in the sgf !

[Nexik\] Good decision];W[cf];B[cg];W[bf];B[dg];W[bg]C[Here is a first question : do I answer that or not ? I did in this game but didn"t protect after this so, I don't know if it was a good choice. I feel that white's move here is just yose so I better go tenuki.

B12 is sente so its good move. White add one stone in his territory (B15).]

it looks like black need to add one stone but A is better place to end in a gote]

(;B[ci]C[This is probably a huge mistake, given white's next move.

yes it's very slow];W[eq]C[Now white's lower side is very strong, so I needed to get points in the middle while reducing white, what do you think is the best choice around here ?]
