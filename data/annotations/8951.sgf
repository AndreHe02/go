C[To my reviewer:

I played the white. This was a close game. I felt like I could win even when we were scoring! Maybe I forgot the komi was 0.5, not 6.5!

I made several obvious mistakes, and afterwards, I tried to minimize the damage. I tried to write down some of my thoughts during the game.

Here are two things I need for help. First, I tried to make my white stones alive in three places. Each of them got only 2 to 3 points. I thought I was surrounded by the black, so I was hurrying saving those stones. Should I have any other way to fight back? Second, did I miss any chance to win in the final stage?

Thanks for your help!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf]C[I want to go slower but stronger. I don't want to fight too early when I play white.

-That's a perfectly good move. A common weakness at the 10k level (well, at all levels really) is to play overcomplicated moves rather than sensible, safe moves like C 14 that are just as good.]
;B[id]
(;W[ec];B[fd]TR[fc][id]C[I want to get sente here, and the story goes as I thought. But I'm not sure if #8 and #9 are good for the white or not.

-Yes, you're thinking along the right lines in defending the corner, but see the variation at move 7. This shape is strong for black.]
(;W[qf]C[I don't like the black to have a big moyo, so I played #10, not the right down corner.

-This is OK, but allows black to secure territory on the top. As hinted at in the variations, black's moyo along the top as not as intimidating as it looks. If you are concerned about reducing it, why not directly play a low move along the top such as N17?]

Thanks for your help!

-Yose seems fine. Maintaing sente is the key in the endgame. You should actually 'calculate' the value of each move (a sente moves is worth twice as much as a gote move)

Overall:
-You played well generally.
-There were some big moves down the left hand side that you missed.
-I get the impession that you are overintimidated by developing moyos. I used to be quite similar and would make silly/risky invading moves. Watch some high-dan games to see how top players deal with them by reduction and carefully planned invasions.
-Perhaps start looking at some joseki after each game you play. For example, the move you should have played at the very start D18 only comes from experience (I had to look up the joseki too, as black played an odd move)
-Practice some life/death problems. To get stronger, you have to be able to think through sequences in your head rather than just going for what looks intuitively right. 
-To contradict myself a bit, the best experince is still actually playing games rather than substantial study (at least until dan-level). 

(sorry, I usually do reviews a bit more detailed than this- I haven't actually played Go for a few months so am a littly rusty. Feel free to email me if you have any questions/want anything clarifying: steven.donlon@new.ox.ac.uk )]

J16 is an unusual move that is good for you. It aims to gain territory in the triangular area but it is not very efficient or effective. Black needs 2-3 moves to actually secure territory here (none of the black variations underneath actually add much) and a low white move along the top side ruins black's position, leading to a squashed or undercut black shape on the left hand side, and no secure corner on the right hand side. 

For this reason I would not be concerned about Sente here as you suggest- black does not have a devestating move to secure the top side that you must immediately prevent.]
