AB[pp][dd][dp][pd]C[jr: Patrick, as before i've put comments at approxiamate points where I think I went wrong and need advice. Of course I may be missing key areas.

bridges: Okay. Before we start, let's talk a little bit about handicap game strategy in general

1. The first thing to notice is that you are starting with 4-4 points. As you probably know, the 4-4 points are oriented toward the center and influence, instead of toward the corner and/or sides, and territory. This means that you're going to probably end up playing an influence-oriented game. This means you have to be willing to fight *when necessary*, and attack when possible, as that's what influence is most useful for. As a weaker player, your fighting is probably where you're weaker, and that's where you're given help if you play it right.

2. In handicap games, white is going to try and pick complicated  fights when he is in a favorable position, for example when he has somewhere to run and you don't. So, an important point is to prepare for and pick the grounds for the fights carefully. If you can keep white sealed in and isolated early on (by playing for influence), he won't have many places to run to when fights get hairy, and you will. When the grounds for the fight favor you, you *must* be willing to fight back. However, don't let white make a complicated fight where you don't need one (this can be hard to decide :-) ) You want to avoid complicated fights without getting pushed around when you are in a good position to fight back. This can be a difficult balancing act. :-)

3. White is probably going to have to leave groups weak to play in other parts of the board, and rely on his fighting ability to save them when and if they are attacked. So, given this, you *should* be looking for an opportunity to attack his weak groups or grab large points like side-star points. Be sure you don't let white lead you around the board. Then you will end up playing only his game, not your own.

4.  Last, but certainly not least, the key to handicap go, particularly high-handicap go is cutting and connecting. If you can connect your stones together (in particular your handicap stones), while keeping your opponent seperated and isolated, then you'll be in good shape.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[fd]TR[nq]C[bridges: Note that white has left his O3 stone (the marked stone) isolated. Black should bide his time and look for an opportunity to attack it. This opportunity is not yet, however, since it risks a double approach in the top left that would be favorable to white.]
;B[fc]LB[ed:A][ec:B][df:C]C[bridges: An interesting play, and not a bad move at all. If white reverts to the 3-4-like joseki pattern, black gets a very large corner, and this is good for black. I've been told that strong players don't like to play this (in even games) because it settles the shape too solidly, but in a handicap game, this is not a bad move at all. You need to be aware that White can try and pick a fight or build thickness by playing A or B.

The normal move (for black) you see in this situation is at C. If black has a stone at or around K17, he can opt to play an E17/F17 exchange first. However, as there is no stone around K17, that is not appropriate here. This is a reasonable move.]
;W[gc]C[bridges: White reverts to what looks like a 3-4 joeski. However, both black and white are one point higher here, so black get more territory in the corner. This is good for black.]
;B[ec];W[gd]LB[df:A][cf:B]C[bridges: This is favorable for black if he continues correctly, though both sides end with a nice, settled shape (which limits flexibility later - good for black, bad for white in a handicap game). Black needs to make sure he doesn't get sealed into the corner by white, however. When playing corner exchanges early in the game, one key is to not get sealed in. Notice in this case that if black plays something on the left side (such as A or B),  white has to choose between helping his stones at the top (by playing near L17 or L16) or helping his stone at the bottom.]

(;B[jq]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[bridges: Too soon to tenuki, I think, and too far from O3. Black needs to play at A or B. Then, he can attack at the bottom or top, depending on what white defends.]
;W[pr]C[bridges: white slides toward the corner to help stabilze himself. Because of the distance of the K3 stone, he can still probably manage to make a base here.]
;B[qq];W[no]C[bridges: Note at this point that O2 is somewhat interesting for black, though it would be better if K3 was at L3 or M3. O2 would help remove eye shape from white and make these stones attackable again, though at this point white could get thick enough as a result to cause trouble for black. Later in game I show some variations here.]
;B[pj]C[bridges: A nice move, though something on the left side is still urgent. This *does* allow for a play near M2 later to remove white's base and continue attacking the white stones at the bottom.]
;W[de]C[jr: This makes me feel I left the top right to do k3 too early.

bridges: It probably should. Now white can either pick a fight at the top if black tries to get into the middle, or he can seal black into the corner while building a thick position.]
;B[ce];W[df];B[cc]C[bridges: perhaps a little overly cautious here. Does secure the corner, though, and now black can come out at E15 and try to split white up a little later.]
;W[kd]C[bridges: White gets the extension he wanted at the top after starting to stabilize the bottom. Black should, however, use this opportunity to grab a point on the left side or to play M2 and go on the attack at the bottom.]
;B[dj]C[jr: Later on I wished this had been lower. Any reasons why i should have decided so at this time?

bridges: It's not a big deal, but a lower stone has a better relation to your stones in the UL corner, and protects the side better. This is on the fourth line, which is influence/center oriented. C10 would have been more territory oriented. Playing for influence is the right idea in handicap games, so I can't really criticize this. C10 does seem slightly better, however.]
;W[cn]C[bridges: White has almost no choice but to jump into black's double-wing formation. He hopes to seperate the D10 stone and then attack it later Black's goal should be to seal white into the side. The resulting thickness can be used to attack the white stones at the LR, and to make a large territory along the bottom.You can attack this in a variety of ways, either from the side or the corner.]

(;B[dn]C[bridges: When you play attach-and-extend, realize that white is probably going to gain strength along the side. In general, attaching to a stone makes both stones stronger. Because of the stone at D10, I probably would have prefered to play D7, C8, or C5.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp];W[em];B[fn]C[bridges: Not unreasonable, but you're playing into white's hands here. The stone at D10 is getting weak. This is why the attach-and-extend was a problem here. Better to F4 and then when white protects his cut, protect he D10 stone.]
;W[cl]C[bridges: Now, the dilema. White has protected the cut, attacking the D10 stone at the same time. Meanwhile, black needs to worry about white pushing through at D5 and cutting. I would protect the D10 stone. F7 is also a big move.]
;B[cg]C[bridges: probably the right choice];W[do];B[eo]LB[ep:A]
C[bridges: Note that A is also an option here, if you have somewhere to connect the F6 stones to.]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[eq]
(;B[dq]C[bridges: I probably would have played F3 instead of D3. I'm not sure which is the correct thing to do.]

(;W[er];B[dr];W[gq];B[hr]C[bridges: a nice move];W[fm];B[gn]
;W[bp]
(;B[bq]C[bridges: better to F3 and make sure you get the white stones, especially in a handicap game.]
;W[cr];B[bo];W[bn]
(;B[fq];W[ao];B[fr]C[bridges: Black defends the side successfully. Nicely done, though white probably could have caused more trouble. Note that he can still play C3 and get about 10 points in the corner.]
;W[qf]C[bridges: moves like this are always frustrating, especially with the now-strong white position along the top.]
;B[nc];W[oc]C[jr: I've never seen this before but with l16 and r14 presing from outside i think I did the wrong things in response.]
;B[od]C[jr: Given the later game I think I'd have done better to q17 and try and take the corner.

bridges: No, I think you made the right response. You build up thickness to attack the R14 stone, while confining white to the corner.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb]
(;B[qd]C[bridges: Maybe too passive. You can double-hane on this side, though it's an exchange that may or may not favor you. You got away with a double hane on the other side that I'm not sure you could have.]
;W[nb];B[mb]C[bridges: This double-hane may be a little touchy here, though it's nice to see you trying it. :-) The problem here is the white strength on the top-left.

Double-hanes often depend on ladders, so doing them facing the middle of the board is something you need to have read out carefully.]

(;W[ob];B[md];W[rb];B[pa]C[bridges: because of the corner, white is alive here. Better to seal him in at S17, or attack the lone white stone, or attack at the bottom. If white manages to pull out the R14 stone, black could get in trouble at the top.]
;W[pb];B[mf]C[In retrospect p14 or q14 might pressure r14 better

bridges: Not Q14. P14 is a nice capping move, and q13 might work too.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[rj];B[rk];W[ri];B[pi];W[ph];B[oh];W[pg]C[bridges: make sure you seal white in tightly in positions like this. White isn't quite alive yet...]

(;B[mr]C[bridges: I think black can play O2 instead of N2 here, especially given that his right side and bottom are fairly secure. See the variations. N2 is aji-keshi (potential-erasing)]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[mp]C[bridges: Now white gets to protect that cut while starting to make eye-shape. N3 makes white stronger. A play at M4 by black now would be crude, helping white even more.]

(;B[lp];W[lo]C[bridges: Now see that M4 made white stronger here? Attack lightly, from a distance.]
;B[kp];W[og];B[mh]C[This didn't connect like I'd intended so i now think o12 was better? Better still to have sorted this out before the earlier foray at the botom

bridges: O12 is definitely better.];W[nh];B[ni];W[ng];B[mg]
;W[mi];B[nj];W[li];B[ib]C[jr: I suddenly realised that it was a long run to connect the p16 group so hoped to either connect underneath or get the chance to surround l16

bridges: A very interesting attack, threatening to 'disembowel' white, to use a phrase of Kageyama's. Note, however, that this doesn't make eyes for the black group at the top left, and there's no way white should let black connect underneath here. Not a good move.

(;B[hb]C[jr: I think this should have been at k18 since I still had h19 underneath and would have played m18 after his m17.

bridges: White can at least start a ko if you try that, though it is an interesting possibility, and better than what happened. See the variation.]
