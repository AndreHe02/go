Thank you for volunteering to review games. I would especially  appreciate an analysis of what I should have played on my third move,  move #6, and also of my first two moves if you think they were bad.  I am "amodeo" on IGS.

TM[600]KM[0.500000]US[Game recorded by IGS. Comments marked "(DA)" made after the game  by Daniel Amodeo, "amodeo" on IGS.]
;B[jj]C[Black plays a move for center influence.   Especially good on smaller boards.]
;W[dc]C[This is a solid corner move,  though most people counter a 4-4 with  another 4-4 to keep the balance of center influence  (at the sacrifice of corner security).]
;B[dj]C[Two star points - strong influence both into the center  and along the lower edge - need to invade immediately  after taking other corner.]
;W[kd]C[I would have played the star point here for more center influence,  or even something unusual, like K9 (4-5).]
;B[id]C[
Looks to me like a very good  move. Black makes it hard for me
 to connect my two stones, and he  threatens to gain territory  and/or influence on the right.  (DA)
-- yes, this is a very good move against 3-4.   It's often difficult to say what is the best response.   Must consider over-all board...  You have two stones at the top,  which means you are stronger in the upper board.  B is strong  in the lower half and center.  One move is to slide under at J-11,  trying to steal B's eye space and force him into center  while capturing the upper edge.]
;W[ie]C[
I suspect this is a bad move,  but I can't decide what would be  a good move for me here. (DA)

second choice is this move, press black down and try to eliminate center influence.
This is a good idea from the point of view of center influence.
It also allows for an approach on the K4 stone at L6 or even L5, though that would be risky.
It also aims at pressing B toward your D11 stone.
If B doesn't respond, W can steal all eyespace and pincer him with G11
or the turn of H10 - both good moves,
but rather small when you look at D7 or the invasion at F3.];B[he]C[B moves into center to try and keep W isolated to right side  - I would build more thickness with J8 (walling in a large territory  on the right and still aiming at attacking both upper and lower B groups  (the cap of H8, the slide at G11, and the splitting attack of G4,  though G4 is normally not a good idea since B can reasonably easily  push W out and take solid territory in both corners)]
;W[je]C[W pulls back - too defensive for this game.   B is left in little danger and so, is left with sente.]
;B[gd]C[I think the press at F11 would have been more sever -  in the opening it's neccessary to leave groups rather unsettled,  in favor of rapid development, in the hopes of capturing large territories.]
;W[kh]C[W is using his strength in the corner to secure the side.   Good, but if you continue with this line of thought,  B will just secure the territory the lower side in the process of defending.   Look at the terriroy B encloses if he plays the attack at D9.   It's a moyo that encloses at least 2/3 of the board,  and though it's rather open, he can assume that W will try to defend  his D11 stone first, which gives him a move like G3.   You should try to attack your opponent before he has a  chance to settle his groups.  Attack the lower side with F3 or H3.]
;B[kj]C[B solidly desends to try and secure corner -  perfect time for G or H3 - double attack on both lower groups -  it threatens to gut the lower right, attack the lower left,  and split the two groups in half.]
;W[ce]C[
Was this too cautious, too  small? (DA) --  too small - you could have made life either along the left or  top if you were invaded and this only lets black strengthen his  grip on the lower half.  At least the approach of C6 if you want to  play on this side of the board.]
;B[ch]C[B is still open to the double attack of G3,  though the fighting is going to be tough for W,  being squeezed between two reasonably secure  (the bottom right is kind weak from the left) black groups.]
;W[ee]C[
Was this too timid? I wanted to  start separating Black's group  --  on the left from his group on  the top, apply pressure against  the latter, and enlarge my  corner territory. (DA)

more aggression - try something like stealing his  eye space with G12, since if both groups live  (which they probably could after this attack)  it doesn't matter if they're connected or not.   But when one group's life isn't secure and you  have your opponent running for safety, he's normally  more worried about saving the group than taking territory  (a common mistake to make in the beginning -  you always have to think "is saving this group  of 3 or 4 stones bigger than taking that 10 point move?"   Sacrifice can be a very power thing if you sacrifice the right things. :)   A move that I think looks promising is J5.   Though it looks like it could be easily disconnected from the L6 stone,  B will probably defend against the invasion of his 30 point lower territory.   This move is difficult to follow up, though,  but it does counter black's next move rather well...

I don't know whether Black is  winning yet. He has more  potential territory than I, but  it is loosely held. If Black is  winning, what did I do wrong?  (DA)
Black almost always takes the lead in the beginning  with the luxury of the first move and, consequently,
the first attack - you have to rebound from the attack
and return fire quickly, before B has a chance to
settle himself.];B[ih]L[fk]C[
Was a move around 'a' better?  (DA) -- great move by B --  this move not only encloses the right W group,  but also connects the upper and lower black groups.   'a' is a good move for capturing the lower territory,  and it's difficult to say which is better.   If W plays 'a', B counters with H3 or possibly D or E3.   W runs in the opposite direction  (which is why D or E3 might be a better response -  the right group has a lot of space where as the  left group is pressed up against the upper left white group).   J6 is more on a large scale -  aiming toward taking not only the lower 30 points,  but also a good 15 points in the center.]
;W[jh]C[
Too small, I think. (DA)  This move seems to only make B  want to further strengthen his hold on the center -  not a good idea.  Let your right group stay a little unsettled  and invade the lower 30 points.  F3 or G3 or maybe even the cap at H8,  but this move will only make B want to capture the 10 points  at the center top as eye space, just in case  he can't connect to his lower groups.]
;B[ii]C[Now B has a solid connection from the lower right to the center -  very strong and very big - the whole B structure encloses 60 points,  to W's 30 or 35.  When you're behind in points like this,  you have to take chances and start a fight -  if you continue on this road you are sure to come up short.]
;W[gj]C[
I think this was a good move and  should have worked, but I'm not   sure. If I had played elsewhere,  Black could have played around  here and made a big, perhaps  insurmountable, gain in  territory. But maybe I had  already lost the game by now.  (DA)

- too high.  B is now secure on the right  and can slide right underneath this stone and  steal all hopes of taking territory -  you're forcing yourself to run to your upper left group.]
;B[hk]C[I would have played F3,  though the double wing extension from the 4-4 is supposed to be bad,  most players lack the agression to invade it  (though it does require at least one more move to settle  (the 3-3 or a 3-4 works well.)]
;W[gk]C[This move would work well if  B doesn't take E3 or something in that area -  it's called the attatch and extend -  connect to your opponent to force him to  defend while giving yourself a little thickness,  then attack in the opposite direction to give yourself breathing space.]
;B[ek]C[Unfortunately, B didn't defend  and instead W is getting squeezed.   For a real interesting sequence, you could try J3 next -  it threatens to connect across either H4 or H2  (H2 is preferable because it's stronger and  gives good chance at eye space).   B should respond with H2 or H4.   W takes the other point.  Then the fighting starts :)  but I think it goes well for W and  if this group lives B looses half of his BR corner  and is reduced on the LL.   You are also left with a nice little extension  into the center that can be used to wreck  much havoc on his right hand group (especially after the cap of H8)]
;W[hj]C[Similar idea - too passive though.];B[ik]C[W must now run away to save these 3 stones.]
;W[fh]L[gh]C[
Was 'a' better? (DA) --  since no ladders will work for W  (except for one to the UL, which would be suprising),  this move has it's weaknesses. Possible options,  strange as it might seem, are to drive into J4 and threaten  either the L5 or K3 cuts.  Of course,  the K3 cut won't work because of the ladder,  but it does give W a forcing move at H2 which  can be followed with E2 for one eye (it ends in gote,  though, which makes it rather questionable).   The cap at H8 has the double purpose of both  seperating the upper group and connecting  to the lower group, which makes it look rather enticing as well.   I would counter a move at 'a' with something like F7,  which, again, has the double purpose of enclosing the lower W group  and connecting the upper and left B groups.   Then again, 'a', F7, and then something like J7 or H8  just might work (sorry it's 3:44 AM and I can't work   out all those variations - the odds are better than for the F6 move, though.)]
;B[eg]C[Greedy move by B - he not only wants to capture the lower 3 stones,  but the F6 stone as well - I would have played F5 right away  and segmented the two groups, but then again,  I seldom go ballistic and try to kill lots of stones,  unless that's the only way to win.  A move to G7 now has a lot of potential.]

(;W[ff]L[gf]M[fh][gj][gk][hj]C[
Playing at 'a' might be better;  it would make it easier for me  to connect to one of my other  groups. (Back up one move and  look at Variation 2.) (DA) --  one of the weaknesses of this one space extension  is that B already has a stone at E7, so he can drive  right between your stones without any fear of capture,  especially with the strong formation at G10.]
;B[fg];W[gg];B[gh]C[This is a questionable move by B.   I think G8 has more potential.  Now W should atari at H6.   If B saves his G6 stone with G5, atari again at H5.   Sacrifice the E6 stone and after black F5, play J7  and connect to the right hand group.   Sacrifice is a powerful thing if you just  sacrifice the right stuff. :)]
;W[fi];B[hg];W[gf];B[hf]C[Now W is segmented and must kill to connect.  Bad spot to be in.]
;W[gi]C[Not really neccessary - sente though...];B[hh];W[dh];B[eh]
(;W[di]L[ei]C[
Terrible move. 'A' is much  better. (Go back one move and  look at Variation 2.) There is  now no doubt that I have lost  the game. (DA) --  'a' would have been better, yes.   Then the fight looks good (but it's tough to read at this point).
I wouldn't say that the game is totally lost, though.  Loose a few
stones in the center, but gain sente in capturing the upper board.
Still lots of points left.];B[ei]
(;W[cj]L[dg]C[
Another terrible move. I had to  play 'a,' but I would have lost  anyway. (Go back one move and  look at Variation 2.) (DA) --  'a' will save the two stones at E6,  but the center group is still lost.]
;B[ci];W[dg];B[df];W[cg];B[ef]C[at this point, you have to decide whether the 3 stones at F8  are more important than the 4 stones at C7.   The 3 stones at F8 seperate two black groups  that are going to be connected anyway if the center group dies  (which it probably will).   The 4 stones at C7 can capture 2 stones at C6,  extend the W territory along the left side  (after C8, which is the move you should play)  and aim at and invasion on black's lower left corner.]

Much better is 'a' or 'b,'  giving up the marked stones and  allowing white to connect, but  saving a large territory in the  corner. I don't think White  could win after that. (DA)]
