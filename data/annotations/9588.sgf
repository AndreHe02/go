AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

thank you for taking the time to look at my game.
I am mainly interested in the fight that happened between moves 54 and 84, as I think that's where I lost the game. Of course, comments to other moves are also welcome.

Daniel (om3)

Hello Daniel, 

I'm grateful for the game you're providing for the review. 
I'll try to analise  the main fight, of course, but also I'm going to show some points in the beginning which you might be interested in.
To help your reading, I'll mark my comments with "A".


Mikhail (AlGebr)];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc];W[cn]
(;B[fp]LB[fq:A]C[A: I consider first, that almost all your stones are placed high, on the 4th line - this can be called a light imbalance and can lead to some long fights which are not good in a handicap game. I prefer playing at A in such situations, because this shape has more opportunities to defend itself.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[ng];B[ph]LB[ng:1][pj:2][ql:A]C[A: The White's move 1 is unusual, but I see it not so rarely. We can call it a good idea, because now the stone 2 isn't in the right position - this Black's shape is already very strong, and placing 2 at A would be better.]
;W[pb]
(;B[qc]LB[ng:1]C[A: As far as I can see, White's group has already been strengthened by the additional stone (1), and therefore he's ready to attack your single stone on the upper side heavily. While the R17 stone makes your group a bit overconcentrated, wouldn't you like to consider developing M17 first?]
;W[le]
(;B[ic]C[om3: Immediately after I put this stone down I thought that k17 might've been better, because m15 and o17 are already in place and W may threaten the placement at l18. So j17 may be a bit thin?

A: I think no - and I have an opposite explanation of "why", which isn't concentrated on the L18 point (it's a severe attack, though). The thing is: either K17 or J17 is placed too close to the White's strength, which is definitely dangerous.
I would like to offer you the key idea: you have no need to protect the M17 stone directly, and an attack like F17 is possible here, too.]
;W[gc];B[ke]TR[nc][le][ne]C[A: I like this move, because it's defending in the right direction - strengthening the marked White's stones, not the left side which can transform into a big territory.]
;W[kf];B[je];W[jf];B[ld];W[me]
(;B[if]C[A: This isn't bad, but I'd consider also a simpler move here - whenever you're able, defend yourself in a way which isn't helping your opponent.]
;W[ig];B[hf]LB[jh:A]TR[le][me][ne][jf][kf][ng]C[I didn't really like this outcome for b. W got lots of influence and I got almost no territory.

AlGebr: I agree that the situation is tough and that your territory is small, but the others are misjudgements: W has gained not real influence for strengthening himself on the valuable left side, but he has only protected the marked group (and he's likely to spent one more move for defending a weakness at A). Since your group is now safe, you can go on for points later, the fact that you haven't got much at this moment isn't for worry.]
;W[dj];B[hg];W[ih]C[A: Usually, I call turnings like this very good moves - but consider please, that by this exchange you've lost an opportunity to cut directly.]
;B[df];W[ce];B[cf];W[ff];B[fg];W[ef];B[eg];W[de]
(;B[dh]LB[dl:A]C[om3: Now I was quite happy again. My position looks strong, w doesn't have too much territory and I have lots of potential at right and lower side...

A: I agree with you here. Since White is now responsible for defending around A and has no stones in the areas mentioned, your chances are great.]
;W[hq];B[jq];W[ho]
(;B[dn]C[A: I would call this a mistake, because you're strengthening the weakest White's group - and you're missing a chance to benefit from attacking it, definitely.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp]LB[fq:1][hq:A]TR[dn][en][dp][fp]C[A: Consider, please, that usually the marked shape of Black's stones is good - but here White's stone A can destroy your points later. That's a pity, and I hope it will motivate you to choose from possible variations in the corner more accurately.
Also, as I've mentioned in the very beginning, the 1 stone will work nicely here.]
;W[nq]

(;B[qq];W[qo];B[pq];W[ql];B[qk];W[pl];B[nj];W[on]
(;B[oo]C[om3: Maybe o4 would've been stronger here, as it is stronger against o3, but the variants look quite complicated to me.]
;W[nn];B[mo];W[lp]C[A: If you can't take off these annoying White's stones immediately, you should try another variations. For example, let us follow the proverb "sound on the east, then strike on the west".]

(;B[jo];W[ko]
(;B[ip]TR[jo]C[om3: I was hoping for W answering at h4 here. Of course, he didn't. With hindsight, I think k6 might've been better here...

A: I see, this hope was too late. What if we think about this case deeply before placing K5 on the board? I think it woult turn out much better.]
;W[jn];B[hp];W[io]
(;B[mn]C[A: I'd like to protect K4 first - it seems to me too painful to give away this stone.]
;W[jp];B[iq];W[po];B[mq];W[mp]C[A: I consider, that now White can't cut. So, shouldn't you take the initiative in the fight, instead of living locally?]

(;B[nr];W[np];B[or];W[op]C[A: Now your stones have only 3 liberties, and I'd like to sacrifice them immediately. While trying to take them away, you have only gifted White a lot of additional points and lost the initiative.]

;B[ji];W[lh];B[cl];W[cm];B[cj];W[dl];B[dk];W[ek];B[ck];W[fl]
TR[ii][hj][hl][il]C[A: Please consider, that you took away White's territory on the left, but that's the end of the attack - White is safe.
The marked stones keep your big center group dead and White's left group at the same time, so they are very effective.

If you hadn't minded to run out with your center group earlier, they wouldn't arise on the board - and therefore, the result would be a great difference.]
;B[em]LB[ic:2][ke:3][df:4][dh:5][ph:1][dl:A][hq:6]C[Well, let me end my comments here with a short summary of this game.

You started well with defending at 1 - very accurate but a bit slow move, then you decided to protect M17 stone directly, with the help of 2 and 3 stones, and therefore you have strengthened your opponent, which is usually not desirable. Dividing the left side with 4 was a possible tactics - and nothing went wrong, because your opponent calmly allowed you to connect everything with 5. Then you met some real difficulties starting from 6, when White served a fight instead of defending his group directly around A point, and therefore you missed some opportunities to keep the lead.


I hope you'll try successfully the following idea in your next games: it is NOT necessary to defend ALL the stones you have on the board, especially when it will be a strategic loss, when this stones aren't important (because they're not cutting, for example) or when it doesn't give you any territory. When you are able to decide correct whether a group of stones is important or not, you're halfway a great player.
