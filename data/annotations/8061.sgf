C[Hi,

this game is a good example of what happened when overplay works. You were totally outplayed on fighting, 3 times in the game.

Ithink you should study basic shapes ("Making Good Shapes" in the Mastering the basics series) and theory around invasion and attack (3Attack and Defense" by Davies for example). Don't try to hard to kill, just build some strenght (so don't let weaknesses) and keep weak stones pressured, territory will come by itself.

This game is a serie of fights so I can only see the problem with shapes. When seeing the game, I feel that you were like panicked during this game. Easy to say but not to do, go is a patient game, against this type of players, keeping your calm is a key to victory. 

Hope you'll enjoy the review
