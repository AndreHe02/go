C[JFR : Any comments appreciated.  I am interested in the fuseki and building a strong moyo.

Thank you!


Hello,

I hope you find these comments helpful.

Best Regards,

Kevin Purvis];B[qd];W[pp];B[dp]C[Your opponent has played diagonal corners. There are three basic types of opennings, territory, moyo, and fighting. Diagonal corners are typically an idication your opponent will want to fight, and it won't be easy to develop a moyo.]
;W[dd];B[oc];W[fq]MA[qj]C[Because of the enclosure in the upper right, black has better development potential along the right side than the lower left corner. A move at R10 would be stronger because it would a perfect five line extension from your star point stone, and an excellent inhibitor of blacks development.]
;B[qj]C[Perfect for black, and the correct move.];W[cn];B[dn]
;W[dm];B[en];W[ci]LB[cp:B][co:A]C[C5 helps develop a base for white and threatens to eliminate blacks, it is a must. When black responds at C4, then you can extend as you did.]
;B[co];W[jp]MA[ip]C[The star point is OK when you can jump in the corner at C3, here you should play at J4.]
;B[cm];W[cl]MA[gc][qn]C[You could consider taking a big point here instead. G17, R6]
;B[bm];W[dk];B[hp];W[fo];B[hn];W[jn]TR[fo][fq]MA[jp]C[Which stone is weaker, K4 on the outside or the two F stones on the inside? Help the weaker stone. Don't let black connect so easily.]
;B[gn];W[fn];B[fm];W[hq];B[gp]C[JFR [8k\]: I want to get that one
JFR [8k\]: going soft on me :op];W[gq];B[fp];W[jc];B[fc]
(;W[ee]C[This is quite unusual. There are several variations to look at. I like D17, the third variation.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fb];B[be]MA[ee]C[Your E15 stone is very unproductive now, and would be better almost any where else.]
;W[oj]C[its a little early to try and cap him to create center territory, there are still too many entries. As black, I'd be happy to make a two point extension, solidify my group and make some territory.]
;B[pn]C[black overplay];W[pl];B[qp]
(;W[np]C[You can't play so soft, he attached to your stone, you must respond. See the variation, fight if he cuts.]

C[JFR : Best way to defend build a moyo here?

Moyos are primarily large scale structures in the opening. Now there is not much of an opportunity. Your current move is OK for linking the two groups up.]
;B[ph];W[nh]MA[mc]C[taking some territory at N17 would be more valuable. It would also strengthen your K17 stone.]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[ld];W[kf];B[il];W[gj];B[ij];W[hh];B[kk];W[ki]
;B[nn]C[JFR : Trouble here!  This comes up as a important point at the end, what is the best way to deal with this now?]
;W[mn]C[That's fine.];B[oo];W[op]TR[nn][po][pp]MA[no]C[O5 is better, force him to connect first, or if he takes your two stones, you capture his one. His O6 stone is much more important that your two.]
;B[mm];W[lm];B[mo];W[ln];B[no];W[lp];B[og];W[nf]C[too greedy]

C[Atari at M12 first, then capture at N8 and your settled.]

;B[kj];W[mj];B[om]C[JFR : This cut ended the game.  Nothing to see after this move.  I Should have taken at N8, correct?

Yes, there is another comment about keeping your group alive later.]

Thanks for reviewing my game.

Your welcome, but your right side group should still live. see the variation coming up.]
