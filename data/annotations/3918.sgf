C[Hello!

This game shows my really bad positional judgement. I won only because I killed 2 big groups, and I thought I was much ahead, but in fact - I was not. Luckilly, my oponent was crushed after losing his second group and he gave up.



My groups were strong, his - very week. But I couldn't take advantage of this.



Please:

- show me how to take advantage of weak groups

- direction of play in important moments of this game

- position evaluation in important moments

- point other errors you see



Many thanx!


Hi,

My name is Peter.
I am a 1k from Germany.
Please bear in mind, that I am not much stronger than you.
But I try to give some usefull hints.
I will prefix my comments with g4:

After I played through this fighting game, I find most of your moves thick and good. You played in a steady and secure way. And you were leading all the time. 
At certain points you may perhaps be a little more aggressive. 
Your only mistake is the wrong evaluation of the situation. You were leading all the time, but you thought to be behind.
You will advance quickly.

Much luck with your upcoming games,

C[g4: all black stones are on the 4th line. You are going to play for influence only.]
;W[nd]C[g4: This gets very complicated as there are numerous continuations.]
;B[oc];W[nc]C[I guess my oponent is creating 2 weak groups now.]
;B[qg];W[qm];B[qn];W[pm];B[fc]LB[gc:B][hc:A]C[g4: You should only play this move, if you know how to handle an invasion at A. If you don't like this, a safer move is at B. I would prefer this.]
;W[hc]
(;B[fe]C[g4: I think this is a good move. K16 has an ideal place to cut the white groups.]
;W[he];B[df]C[At least I should seal him in the corner. I failed awfully,]
;W[cf]
(;B[de]LB[cg:A]C[g4: I don't like this one. It will be gote. Just A should be sufficient.]
;W[ce];B[ed];W[dc];B[cg];W[bg]C[g4: White is alive. He should tenuki.]
;B[ch];W[bh]
(;B[ci]LB[kf:A]C[g4: I would tenuki here as black. A move around A seems good to me.]
;W[qe]C[g4: This is an overplay by white.];B[pe]C[g4: Good!]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[rg];B[rh];W[qh];B[pg];W[re]C[g4: white should take the stone and discard the corner.]
;B[qi];W[ph];B[pi];W[oh];B[rj]C[g4: Good! White has 5 weak groups.]
;W[qc];B[nf]LB[sg:A][sh:B]C[Weak group above, not quite alive in cornet - but I couldn't take advantage of this. Upper edge is another big failure of mine - gave him lots of territory, didn't get anything from this.
g4: I disagree completely. This is a very good situation for black. As you mentioned, black is not quite alive. And he has a lot of weak groups. Ok, you have to take advantage anyway, but that cannot be helped. You have to learn to take advantage - I have to do this also :-) 
In the following situation no one plays A or B. I think this is sente alost, and it strngthens ones own group while weakening the other.]
;W[ld];B[lf]LB[jf:A]C[g4: This is the right move I think. Although I would be tempted to play at A. But that seems too ambitious for black.]
;W[mh]C[g4: I would play A to secure 2 weak group by connecting. White is trying to save all his groups.]

(;B[ke]LB[kd:B][je:A]C[g4: This is bad shape. But secure. I think you must not let the groups connect. So a move at A or B seems necessary to me.]
;W[jc]
(;B[id]C[g4: I would rather cut the white groups. I will be a ko, but you can win it. Letting white connect in sente is a risk.]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[gd];B[gc];W[kd];B[jf]LB[je:A]C[g4: Better to connect at A.]

g4: I don't think that white had time to sorround this group. It is only natural that this group will escape into the center.]

[sr][qs][rs][ss]C[I got him. But another disaster is coming on. His weak center group spoiled my center moyo, strengthened itself and evene took some territory.
g4: You got him yes. But you should have another view of the board. 
First count.
White: secure 32 points.
Black: secure 45 points. 
So you only have to build a wall against the bottom, and get as much territory as white. That should be no problem regarding the weakness of his center group and the thinness of his bottom stones.]

Let's count again.
White: secure 31 points
Black: secure 69 points.
There is no more room for action. White is lost.
You can invade at 3-3, get some territotry with A and secure your groups.]
