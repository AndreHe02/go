;B[gg]C[I played this game against weaker players on a 9x9 board. I won this one and my opponent asked me why. Well, I must admit that I couldn't tell him and I suspect that I played some overplays. Me and my opponent would like to have an review of this game to learn about the losing moves and hidden chances to win.

Comments: Andre Bergholz (marked with AB).];W[dc];B[gd]TR[cg]
C[Would the maked stone be better?

AB: Maybe slightly. Now White has the option of G8 later.];W[cg]

(;B[eb]TR[de]C[Is D5 better?

AB: This move is not so great, F8 would be more solid. Leaves many options for White. D5 or D3 are probably better.]

(;W[fe]C[Is that reasonable?

AB: I would prefer F3.];B[ge];W[fg]C[Overplay?

AB: No, very good.]
(;B[ed]TR[cb]C[Right direction? Or ist C8 better?

AB: This is better than C8, because it attacks the F5/F3 stones better. F4 is a peaceful alternative, which may be good enough.]
;W[de]
(;B[ee]C[AB: F4 works, no?];W[ef]
(;B[fd]C[AB: Maybe a little slack.];W[db]TR[gf]C[Is that good? Is the Ko with G4 better?

AB: No, D8 is big.];B[ec];W[gh];B[hh];W[fh]C[AB: You don't play overplays, quite the contary :-). G4 is risky, but possible.]

(;B[gi]C[AB: Maybe cut at D6.];W[gf];B[hg]
(;W[ff]C[AB: Very safe again, H4 is possible.];B[hf];W[ea]C[AB: Now here is an overplay.]

(;B[fa]C[AB: D6!];W[da]
(;B[fb]C[AB: Cut at D6 right away!];W[dd]C[This is absolutly necessary for white.

AB: :-)];B[fi];W[ei];B[hi];W[eh]C[AB: Altogether, Black gave in a little too often in the middle game. The D6 weakness was there for a long time and could have been exploited. But it was a good game for both of you, I think. I 've added a lot of variations just to see in what directions the game could have gone. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to email me at Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com.]
