thanks for spending some time on this game. I hope it will be interesting for you, too.   I played White in this game and lost by 8.5 points. We both made some mistakes - sure :-) - but in the early middle game I sometimes had no idea how to play. I added some notes there...

Thanks again and please feel free to show some variations...

Bye, Jorg]RE[W+8.50]

;W[jc]C[{tom} I might have played on K16 instead, hard to say.  Definitely good area.]
;B[gc]C[Is this move too small? {tom} I would approach from one side or other.  This seems fine.]
;W[mc]
;B[op]C[I was thinking about playing P17, but the kakari seemed to be bigger. What do you think? {tom}Professionals might say bottom is less interesting since F3 is only 3rd line but I would do this

{tom}Looked this up in vol 2 of Ishida's Dictionary of Basic Joseki, p125. A & B are reasonable, C is not.  With B black is sealed in but has cash. After A,  D B E F G H
]
;B[pn]LB[no:D][oo:A][po:B][np:F][pp:C][nq:G][oq:E]C[I do not really know any joseki with the high pincer. What is the best move here?
{tom}I think Q6 is overplay, see previous comment.  White starting with A looks pretty good locally.  Or just  E G Q3 F R6.  Think of this as 5-4 opening but white has an extra stone at N4
]
;W[qn]
;B[qm]C[{tom}R6 is used if the ladder favors W when cuts at Q7 or if white wants a very complex fight.  P3 instead of R6 damages N4 so I like P5. With B stones in upper left I like R7!

;B[rp]C[I was lucky. :-)]
;W[qs]LB[nq:D][oq:C][or:B][pr:A][ps:E]C[{tom} Use your stones to utmost.Q2!!!  A-E gives larger profit in sente for black.]
;B[ro]
;W[pr]LB[qi:B][qp:C][nq:A]C[{tom}A or B seem like large moves for black here.  B is to capture the 2 stones on a larger scale.  A undermines white moyo and threatens corner with C as followup.]
;B[rk]C[I played this move too fast. Maybe it is not necessary. Which moves do you suggest?]
;W[qp]C[That seems to be small at this stage of the game. But where are the big moves for Black now? {tom}see previous.]
;B[ld]LB[oc:A][me:B][pf:C]C[I tryed to attack the two-space-extension, but I could not manage to make something out of it. Do you have a better idea?
{tom}White has about 50 pts on bottom (invasion at H3 is tough).  Black has more influence so harrassing the 2 stones is good. Perhaps black A B C, then M16 later?]
;W[md]
;B[le]
;W[qf]LB[lc:B][qd:C][oe:A]C[{tom}M16 weakens Q16 so is not effective attack. See next move comments.]

;B[me]C[{tom}Good]
;W[lc]
;B[ie]
;W[ob]
;B[pc]C[Oops. I slpped, that move should have been on line closer to the border...]
;W[hd]
;B[hc]LB[ib:C][jb:D][ic:B][id:A][pk:E]C[{tom}black should consider J16 instead.  A H17 B C D for example.  Also E is a big sente move for either side.]

;W[je]
;B[kd]C[this is aji keshi (removes potential) for black. K18 was big endgame move.  This is worthless.]

;B[nb]LB[ib:C][jb:H][lb:B][mb:D][pb:G][nc:A][oc:E][ne:F]C[{tom}A-E works great for white and now a cut at F is possible for white.  Perhaps black plans A E B D H cutting off 5 stones but A E D G so just play G.]

;B[bf]
;W[bd]LB[go:C][ep:A][eq:B]C[{tom} I have set up an alternate sequence starting with E4 for black. This looks difficult for White if doesn't E3.  Therefore A B C is much better for black than what you did.]

;B[fn]
;W[gp]LB[im:C][ho:A][lo:E][hp:B][iq:D]C[{tom}Black must push here. A B C here. And D if white fails to defend at B.  Now a move around E starts to form another black moyo.  :-)]

;W[jr]C[At least I was able to destroy some territory in sente.]
;B[im]C[This is maybe a slow move. Better F11? What do you suggest? {tom} First Q9 then this is good as dual purpose.  F11 seems small and slow to me.]
;W[hl]
;B[hm]C[Correct?]
;W[gf]
;B[ge]
;W[gi]
;B[jk]C[What about this move? {tom} OK but Q9 and K14 should be first.]
;W[ig]
;B[jf]
;W[jg]
;B[jb]C[Lucky again.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pb]C[Do you know a way to capture White? L19 maybe... {tom} Q18 is good then maybe K11]
;W[la]C[oh, die hab ich wieder leben lassen...]
;B[ej]C[??? {tom}This gains cash but K11 first?  And Q9 of course.  Black is well ahead so just harass the white stones while building territory around N10]
