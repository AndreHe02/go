C[Dear reviewer.

I played Black in this game and I belive that I made in the beginning of the game some major strategic and tactic errors and fell behind. Any helpful comment here is highly appreciated.

I have also always problems countering  efficiently invasions. Comments on how to handle better the invasion white did into my moyo will be greatly welcomed.

I eventually won this game because White made at some points a slight error and I got the chance to run up.

I don't know if my endgame was good or not (usually I am poor in the endgame), but it looks I made up most of my points there, eventually overtaking white.

I have added comments to this game record which hopefully make you better understand why I did choose certain moves.

Thanks for your time and help.

PJK: Hi Tomjk, my name is Piotr.  I believe that you make quick progress in Go if you keep in mind, your focus is at the board level, not at the local level. You don't need take everything to win - only few point more then your opponent!  If you have any question sametimes I play in IGS as Piotr or PJK.]
;B[dc];W[dp];B[pd];W[pp];B[ce]C[My favorite strategy for opening with Black.]
;W[jd]LB[mc:a][nc:b]MA[jp]C[Very good splitting attack by my opponent.  PJK: Its great move on board.   Now I didn't know what to play ...

The extension down to C10 looked too small.

PJK: Yes, Its very slow.

Neither did I want to play J17 since this would provoke some extension of white towards O16-17 an I would have then to defend my stone at Q16.

PJK: J17 is vulgar move. It's help only white.

Also a splitting attack around K3-4 seemed not the right move to get the best of the advantage to play Black.

PJK: K3-4 is good move - very big. It's ideal place to white stone - then is good for Black!

Any comments?

PJK: Other good point is "a" (N17), because "b" (O17) is ideal develop from K16!]
;B[cm]C[I played here in order to build up some framework on a larger scale and attacking white in the corner.

PJK: K3-4 is large and good for white and Black! But this move is not wrong!]
;W[co];B[em]C[PJK: K3 is still better. And only help white to correct position in low coroner.]
;W[fp]C[Now I was faced with the decsision to make a move at around D11 and allowing white to play around K5 or to play at L3 myself and see what white does.]
;B[kq]C[I was confident to get my group C7 and E7 out of trouble if white chooses to attack.]

(;W[nq]MA[iq]TR[pp]C[White attacks from its "weak" side.

PJK: J2 is better. Market stone is not weak! Is very good point! See var...]
;B[hq]C[I settle my group and threaten to play E2 later.];W[gq]

(;B[hr]C[I decide to pull down here.
Better would be probably a move like J5, but I didn't want to provoke a local response from white which would weaken my two stones at C7 and E7.

Comments?

PJK: H4 is only good move, see variant.];W[gr];B[di]MA[hd]C[Maybe too thin (too far from the stones C7 and D7)?

PJK: It's not too far, It's too slow. Play in large scale example H16 to create large moyo.]
;W[qf];B[pi]SQ[qf][jd]C[I didn't want to allow a white moyo to materialise here.

Eventually it materialized nonetheless, but I got some profit elsewhere.

PJK: It's bad strategy. If you wont take same profit, you mast give same your opponent. The balance is very important. In top-right corner White have 2 good stones and have move!]
;W[nc]MA[jd]C[PJK: Good! ideal point from K16];B[nd]C[I am attacking  the "stronger" white stones in order to attack later the lone white stones.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[me];B[nf]MA[oc]C[PJK: Right-Top corner is big - P17!]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[mf]MA[hd][hc][oc]C[Probably an error. Maybe Q13 was better?

Now I don't get anything in this corner and white stabilizes its group ... :(

PJK: Yes, P17 is big sente, and next  H16-17.  Q13 is bad move!   You don't  allow white to build moyo then white take BIG corner!]

(;W[re]C[PJK: Error. See var ..];B[rd];W[qi]
(;B[rc]C[Another mistake - I force white to connect and I have to defend now myself ending up in gote.

I think this is an endgame move. Better would maybe Q9 or R10 I think now ...

Probably I should've given up this corner trying to build up some wall facing the white stones O3 and Q4 ... (see variation)

Comments?

PJK: P17 is still big sente!];W[oc];B[qe];W[rf];B[pf]MA[qj]
C[PJK: Very slow and heavy! Not necessary.
The right side is important now. Tray flat white. ex. R10];W[pj]
;B[hc]C[I decide now to sacrifice Q11 (a big error as I see later in the game, as this gives a big moyo to white and I barely win.

I choose instead to build up a huge moyo for myself (even as I know that I always have trouble killing groups inside of my moyos...

PJK: H17 is good! You have now big territory! But, White have ...]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[ph];B[if]MA[oi][hh]C[I give up the stone at Q11 ... white spends four moves and I use them to map out my moyo.

PJK: Yes but:
- White takes moyo too.
- If you play P11, white take bad aji.
- H12 is in large scale.];W[oi]C[PJK: Ponnuki is ideal formation]
;B[qq]MA[jj]C[I decide it is time to take the corner ...

PJK: Yes, but you take corner in gote! The better strategy is increase moyo. ex. K10.
You have time to invade or flat white. Your territory is bigger]
;W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qn];B[pr]C[PJK: Mistake. P2];W[dg]
C[So ... now the trouble starts.
My strategy is now not to capture this group, but chase it towards the strong white wall, making points on the way and reduce white's territory there.

A stronger player would probably kill this group quickly, since it looks too deep inside of my moyo.

Comments?

PJK: Yes, I think that invasion is not good! Too deep.

Estimating the score (which I do count regularly during the game) I get at this point:

white: approx. 56 + 5.5komi = 61 points
Black: approx: 58 points (assuming that I do not catch the white stone at D13)

I am slightly behind in points, but I have target which I can chase around.]
;B[cg]C[Having counted the score I decide not to try to kill the white group at all costs, but just make as much profit as possible while chasing the white group.

Comments?
PJK: Yes, it good idea, but not this time. You'll try count territory if white live through Black territory! Mast kill white.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[fh];B[ei];W[eh]C[PJK: Bad sharp for White! Heavy.]
;B[ff]C[This looked as a vital point to White, but maybe D14 was better?

PJK: D14 was better, but in my opinion  E14  is vital point!]
;W[ef];B[fe]MA[fg]C[Trying to keep things easy for me.

PJK: F13!   :)];W[ee];B[dd]MA[ed]C[Again trying to keep things easy for me.

PJK: E16!];W[ed];B[ec]MA[cf][ci]SQ[fe][ff]C[A big error, which gets later close to desaster, but fortunately White is not perfect either ...
I think the only move here is F18?

PJK: F18 is good and E17 is ok!
White have good position! Weaknes in Black groups and position.]
;W[fd];B[gd]MA[fc]C[PJK: F17 and  Black connect!];W[fc];B[ib]
C[Now I have to sacrifice this stone to avoid thatWhite connects and all my plans are thwarted.]
;W[jb];B[fb];W[gb];B[eb];W[hb];B[gc]C[Horrible shape (a lump of 4) ...]
;W[ge];B[id]C[As soon as I played this move I realised that this was wrong - but fortunatelyfor me White misses its chance here (see variation).]

;B[nn];W[ol];B[lk];W[mi]MA[fg][nn][no][ij][jj][lk]C[At this point I could've probably captured the White group. But honestly I have no clue how to do this and I also need to patch my various defects...

Is it possible to kill White in this situation? Any hint will be welcome.

I thought it was time to count again:

White: approx. 66 + 5.5 komi
Black: approx. 54 points

Time to make some points!
So I decided instead to stick to my plan and get points while attacking the group.

PJK: Its problem to kill big Black group in centre. White group is strong! Make eye in F13 and second in centre. Black have week groups.]
