;B[do];W[kq];B[cj];W[ce];B[qj];W[ql];B[hc]C[This looks a little over-stretched. White can easily invade the upper side and put pressure on the H17 stone. I think J17 or K17 would be better.]
;W[gd]C[This is an odd move. Black is happy to answer.];B[hd]
;W[qh];B[oj]C[Another move here is Black Q11. This will prevent the White S10 and put more direct pressure on White.]
;W[oh]
(;B[mj]C[The usual move here is P8.];W[rd]C[This is normally played at R15 in this situation.]

(;B[mh]C[This doesn't really do anything. The black N10-R10 stones are already out, and White can connect under at S10, and make a life in the corner.
Since White didn't play R15, this is maybe a good move for Black now.]
;W[qe];B[pd];W[rc];B[of];W[pg];B[ng]C[Not too bad for Black after all.]
;W[ol];B[pk]C[No, Black do not want to strengthen White here! Black must invade at R3, and making White play Q8 first will only make it harder for Black.]

;W[fr];B[qq]C[At last, but possibly too late. This might be a difficult invastion now, because Black has nowhere to run if White decides play tough.]

;W[ro];B[oq];W[nr];B[rp];W[sr]C[Normally, the killing move is S2 here. T2 might lead to ko or seki.
However, in this situation, with the cutting point at Q5, I'm not sure either move will kill.]
