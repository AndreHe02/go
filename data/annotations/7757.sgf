C[<Svante> This is a game from the german Bundesliga.  It felt like a close game for a long time, but in the end, I feel that my stamina was not sufficient.  However, I cannot point to my really severe errors, nor to those of my opponent, so I would be glad if you could lend some enlightenment.  I held the white stones, but please analyze for both sides.

[kb\]: Hi, I will do my best with your game.];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp]

;W[qk];B[pi];W[ol];B[nk];W[om];B[jc]C[[kb\]: It is also OK to think about tenuki in this situation.]
(;W[pc]C[<Svante> I thought that I could break the standard pattern at this point, because I did not like to give sente to Black once more.  I give the standard pattern as variation.

[kb\]: This is the correct move locally.];B[oc]
(;W[ob]C[<Svante> I am not sure whether the other hane, at R16, would be better here.

[kb\]: This is an overplay.  Also, you get a better result with the R16 hane.]
(;B[pb]C[[kb\]: Black's move is not good.];W[qc];B[qb];W[od]

;B[mc]
(;W[rb]C[<Svante> Would stretching to N18, sacrificing the corner, be worthwhile?  I made a variation with what I have in mind.

[kb\]: It's playable but I prefer the corner, since Black still has some weaknesses.]
;B[mb];W[qa]
(;B[kf]C[[kb\]: This is an interesting move by Black - it's usually not good to finish the territory directly because neither group is in any direct danger, but *no* action here is probably not prudent, either.  It might be called honte (Black is already leading at this point).]
;W[co]C[<Svante> I believe that White has a good point at M12, but at this time, Black probably attacks immediately.  Therefore, I thought that it would be premature now.

[kb\]: It might be too late if you do nothing, but I understand your reluctance to play there.  However, N3 first is probably better.]
;B[de]C[[kb\]: A little slow, since Black is so thick here already.]
;W[dh]C[[kb\]: Right direction.]
(;B[fc]C[<Svante> This is an interesting move by my opponent, as I intended to play exactly here if he chose to employ the ogeima response, the one point jump, or the outside attachment (see variations).

[kb\]: Perhaps.  E17 is still better than this move.];W[ed]
;B[ef]C[[kb\]: This shape is so strange...];W[fd];B[gc];W[gd]
;B[hd]C[[kb\]: This move helps White, better to play H17.];W[he]
;B[id];W[gf]C[[kb\]: White has good shape and an excellent attack on the E14 stones.]
;B[eh]
(;W[dg]C[[kb\]: Too early!];B[eg];W[dj]
(;B[gh]C[[kb\]: Big mistake.  Black can trap White here.];W[ig]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd]C[[kb\]: Black loses momentum here.]
(;W[ii]C[[kb\]: How about leaning off of the strong Black group first?]
;B[fj]
(;W[dl]C[<Svante> Would L12 be better?];B[jh]C[[kb\]: Good timing.  Now L13 is impossible.]
;W[ih];B[ik]C[[kb\]: Excellent move.];W[ji];B[kh]C[[kb\]: Heavy]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[kk];B[jq];W[il];B[hk];W[mj];B[ni]TR[kh][jh]C[[kb\]: Black has managed to block White off and fix any remaining weaknesses in the territory at top, so this has to be a Black success.]
;W[hq];B[jm];W[mp];B[no]C[[kb\]: There is little point resisting this.]
(;W[ln];B[ll];W[kl];B[km];W[lm];B[ml]
(;W[ee]C[<Svante> I believe that White should play K5 first.]
;B[df];W[bc];B[eb];W[db];B[bd];W[ac];B[jo];W[nn];B[mo];W[kp]
;B[jp];W[lo];B[nm];W[oo]C[<Svante> During the game, I did not see that I could atari at N7 first to keep the connection.  I am not sure whether that is actually better, though, and whether Black should have connected O4 now.]

;B[qq];W[qr];B[rr];W[nr];B[lr];W[mr];B[ks];W[pr]C[[kb\]: The result is pretty equal, but Black is still leading.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[cn];W[dn]C[<Svante> I think that White should nobi here to make things harder for Black.  During the game, I thought that D6 would be more solid, but it seems to lose too many points.

[kb\]: Yes, D5 is better.  You might have a chance to kill something on the outside.

[kb\]: This is the last mistake.  Now Black will gain the corner, part of the side and White has little defense...]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[cp];W[do];B[bq];W[bn];B[ap];W[bm]C[[kb\]: The left is not so valuable because of B16 (and A16 is also sente).]
;B[dp];W[ep];B[cq]C[<Svante> The shape is very bad now for White.]
