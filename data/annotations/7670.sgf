C[Dear reviewer,

thanks a lot for taking a look at this game. It was as close as it could get, with me on the lucky 0.5 end.

Looking back at the game I have the impression that both sides had many overstretched formations, which resulted in many weak groups. My main problem is that I don't know how to handle the invasions. Especially, I don't have a feeling what a reasonable/fair outcome would look like. Furthermore I have problems with the correct direction of play during the fuseki.

Could you also please point out the major mistakes by white.

Thanks a lot,
/Axel];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[jp];W[qk]C[stp: I am not sure this was right, it is much too slow and it enables black to build a strong moyo either with the helps of the two stones. It gives Black the opportunity to play a Sente move. Usually White at the beginning, because White is late needs to keep the Sente. Here with this move White is giving the Sente to Black.]
;B[qn]C[derAxel: the corner enclosure seemed to be a natural move]

[ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[stp: We see the difference there between Black and White moyos]
;B[qe];W[rm]SQ[qi]C[stp: this is also a mistake. Playing there is pushing Black to strengthen its group even more. So black is creating its territory and White has still some aji]
;B[rn]C[stp: there you go];W[qm]
(;B[fq]LB[jd:B][dj:A]SQ[gq][hq][iq][er][fr][gr][hr][ir][es]
[fs][gs][hs][is]C[derAxel: is playing around here okay, or is a play at the other sides better?

stp: F3 looks very slow and is helping white to build his moyo.Basically with F3, Black created a moyo of 13 points pushing White to create a moyo on the left which is exactly what he wanted to do. Also it doesn't create a new basis for Black]
;W[cn]
(;B[dr]TR[fc]C[stp: D2 is much too early. At this stage, one should never play at the second line. F17 was probably much more important. D14 is more agressive and]
;W[cq]TR[lp][mp][np][hq][lq][mq][nq]SQ[jp][fq]C[derAxel: I made that exchange in order to enforce the marked stones.

stp: it is too early to enforce those stones. Black still have aji anyway (highlighted with the triangle marks). So in order to protect those stones Black gave up the possibility to attack D16.]
(;B[jd]LB[ci:A]TR[fc][gc][mc]C[derAxel: Is it better to play here or at the other side (A)?

stp: I am not sure I understand what the purpose of this move is? Either it gives White an opportunity to build his moyo or it gives Whithe the possibility to attack the 2 stones in the corner.
The other side at A is probably not good either];W[gc]TR[di]
C[stp: the urgent move next is around C11. If White plays here first he will have a big moyo. If it is Black, it will reduce dramatically White ambition.]
;B[pg]TR[di]C[my intention was to build a small moyo on 

stp: to play around D11 was probably much more big];W[ph];B[og]
;W[rf]C[stp: this is again much too early. Play at the second line of the game at this stage is playing yose move and the game is of course not at this stage now. This also reenforce Black. He will probably answer S15 and will lock definitely the corner, so what is the benefit?]
;B[re];W[dj];B[fo]TR[jg][kh][gm][on]SQ[dh]C[derAxel: again, a moyo building move. Or is it urgent to invade/reduce white's formation?

stp: Question is too complex for me. I guess it depends on the style of the player. Some people prefer a moyo strategy other prefare to invade and reduce.
What struck me more for this move is that I feel it is a little slow!
Triangle stones are some suggetion that seems more ambitious compare to F5.

If Black wanted to invade, maybe D12 would have been a good choice?]
;W[mq]C[derAxel: big question: how to handle this? What outcome would be okay for black?]
;B[np];W[mp]C[derAxel: heavy move, or?];B[kq];W[no];B[op]
(;W[oo]C[stp, this is a little too ambitious. to play secure at this stage would have harm enough Black without seeking higher results!]
;B[mo]C[stp: correct punishment!];W[lo];B[mn]
(;W[pp];B[oq];W[pn];B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[om];B[lp];W[ln];B[mm]
;W[nc]TR[lf][mf]C[stp: invasion is too deep. Black is too strong. Better secure the invasion.]
(;B[oc]LB[lc:A]C[derAxel: again, how should this be handled. What would be a reasonable outcome? Would it have been better to play A instead?

stp: playing at A would basically mean that you are sure to kill O17 which can be playable but doesn't look that easy!!! It looks like White can live if Black plays at A.]
;W[kc];B[jc]
(;W[kb]C[stp: I would have played L16 but it looks like I would have been wrong and L18 is much better (probably because of G17 that enables White to escape on the top if required]
;B[kd];W[ld]
(;B[kg]C[stp??? Why is black stoping the pressure?];W[ob];B[pb]
;W[ib];B[lc];W[mc];B[nb];W[mb];B[oa]C[derAxel: that's nonsense, of course.

stp: yes];W[dg]C[stp: very good move];B[cc]CR[dd]LB[fk:3][dl:1]
[em:2][mm:A][mn:B][mo:C]TR[fc][cf]SQ[gc][dg]C[derAxel: Is this correct timing for the invasion? Or is a reduction more reasonable?

stp: No I think it was the right time to do it. White has to answer anyway and because Whithe chose to play far away from D16, White has to answer and Black may keep the sente to reduce later on.

Alternative might have been to play around 1, 2 and 3 so as to create a big moyo on the middle of the game. The three stones ABC been alive, it is interesting to build the moyo. 1 and 2 seem a little better compare to 3 (White has to answer)]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb]TR[ed]C[stp: after this E16 is required. The only way to leave. Big mistake not to play there]
(;B[bd];W[be]
(;B[bc]TR[bb]C[stp: no chance to leave anymore. B18 is mandatory there and leads to a ko]
(;W[db];B[ed];W[fc]
(;B[de]LB[ce:A]C[derAxel: would A have been better?

stp: It looks like with A, Black would have been able to leave although usually E16 is played earlier]
;W[ce];B[fe];W[df];B[he];W[ee];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[cl];B[km]
LB[en:A]SQ[ej][nj][nk][mm][mn][mo]C[derAxel: is the weakness at A severe?

stp: I don't think so. But L7 is completely unnecessary. The 3 stones are alive and there is no way for the 2 White stones to leave.

I think Blacj should have played in order to extand its moyo and reduce White moyos at the same time]
(;W[hj]TR[dk]C[stp: playing there looks ok to attack H10. White has the choice to save H10 and let Black invade his territory or protect his territory but loose H10.]
(;B[hl]C[stp: this answer is much too submissive];W[kj];B[mg]
C[derAxel: I had the impression that the last two moves by white did not fulfill any purpose and I could simply connect the weak group at the top left and convert some potential territory into real.

stp: Well in fact the two last moves basically screwwed the Black territory in the middle!]
