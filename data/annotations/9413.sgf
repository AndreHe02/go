C[klee [7k\]: hello
Elom [7k\]: Hello, gg];B[pd]C[Hello, I'm Elom, and thank you very much for reviewing my game. I'll mark any notes I might have with Elom:

I would really appreciate some help with my positional judgement and direction of play-- if my opponent doest leave a weak group to attack, I frequently start of behind. What helps me is my reading in middlegame fighting, is my style sometimes to aggressive?

fa: hi elom, my name is fauzan and i'll review this game. i'll mark my comment with fa.]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[fc]C[Elom:Is it okay to approach from this side?

fa: it's bad to approach from this side. have you consider what to do if your opponent play pincher?]

(;B[cf];W[db];B[cc];W[ic]C[fa: black should take the corner since the upper left group already solid.]

(;B[cj]
(;W[qq]C[fa: good, this corner is big. i prefer hoshi or komoku tough since it's make it easier to take the bottom. sansan only secure corner.]
;B[qj];W[nc];B[pc]
(;W[ne]C[Elom:Is this move too slow?

fa: yes, this move doesn't really develop your area nor this threathen black area.]
;B[qf]
(;W[po]C[fa: playing here is wrong since the corner already settled. it's better if you develop the bottom left corner instead.]

(;B[jq]C[Elom:I checked a proffesional game database and wite's next move is never h3 so...]

(;W[hq]C[Elom:Is this from the wrong side

fa: no, this is right. when deciding which side should we approach we should consider which side is weaker. bottom right corner already belong to white so white should strengthen his bottom left corner.]

fa: white should cut.];B[rl]C[Elom:At this point the game seems to be more or less even, but then I played  bad move trying to create some central influence.

fa: white is behind by around 10 point difference. but it still playable.
yeah, center is no good since black can instantly reduce the center using help of his k3 and n3 stones.]

Elom: I took a whooping, but more importanlty a lesson in go.
Thank you very much for reviewing my game, your help is greatly appreciated.

Are there any books/resources you might suggest for me to help me on my weaker points?

Thanks, Elom.

Fa: you should consider about:
1. direction of play. think about what you want, try to get it, and think about what your opponent want, don't let him get it. think more about what you possibly get when you made your move.
2. don't worry about sacrificing stone(s) when you can get more.
3. always remember that center is the hardest place to convert into territory. you should always aim for corners then sides then center. if you have special strategy, it's fine to aim at center directly, but if you don't, never aim for center.
4. learn about sente (a move that must be responded) and gote (a move that can be ignored).

probably that. as for suggestion material, i think it's good if you learn from the review in gtl, choose a game that 2-3 lever higher than your current level. it's also good to discuss the game with your opponent/ask for live review.

i guess that's all. good luck and have fun playing. :)];B[tt]
