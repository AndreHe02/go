AB[pd][dp]C[MasamuneGo: Thank you in advance for taking the time to review my game.  I am playing black.

(;B[jq]LB[dp:C][fp:D][gq:E][hq:B][jq:A][gr:F]C[[Broege: I'm not sure about this pincer - White can easily invade (as in game) and Black A cannot put the pressure on B then - as stones C and D are weakened by White.

I would play at E (or F when feeling adventurous) but I known it's not a good move - see the variations.\]]

(;B[eq];W[fr];B[cm]C[MasamuneGo: Something like N3 would have probably been better, right?

[Broege: I would stick with protecting the C5 group - K3 stone always can run to the center.\]]

;W[gg];B[hg];W[gh];B[kf];W[ll];B[lj];W[kk]LB[ei:A]C[MasamuneGo:  I think here I was overly concerned with the safety of my K4 group, and not enough with securing territory in the center.

[Broege: There is a saying that there's no territory in the center :D
If you want to take territory - moves like A usually take more profit than surrounding the center.\]]

[gm:A][so:D]C[MasamuneGo: I'm not really sure what I was thinking here...

[Broege: Yes, this move gives Black nothing and only strenghtens White. Perhaps A or B would be better to win a few stones. C and D are probably the largest yose moves (not that I'm good at yose)\]]

The ko at A is still unfinished - not that it matters much except for rule purists But it shows a moment of deconcentration.

Apart from the fuseki I would not play that much differently so perhaps the difference between 14 and 9 kyu is not that big. And as for the fuseki - everyone has his/her own likings - I'm not good enough to tell that some plays are wrong.

I think that the biggest mistake of the game was not to limit White upper left - i.e. by playing in the upper left corner.

The tactical errors (moves B or C) were more than recompensated by spotting of good moves like D and E.

Overall I would assume that reducing opponent's influence and territory might your biggest weakness.\]]
