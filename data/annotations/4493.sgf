C[Hi!
Games like this make me doubtful about my rank. I'm playing as black and lose pretty badly.

I have included quite a bit of ideas behind my moves and questions about them. Answer the ones you find relevant and comment as well on the mistakes I failed to find myself :)
Thank you for all your comments.];B[qd]C[dede: Hi, I'm 4k in my country ranks, I hope you'll find my comments useful.]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[od];B[qf]C[genecyst: I like to play this joseki because my opponents make mistakes in it :>

dede: It's generally bad idea to count on opponents mistakes, especially in fuseki stage. Concentrate on establishing good position, choose joseki to maintain balance of territory and influence.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pd];B[qb]
(;W[qe]C[dede: White should have a ladder to play this move. Without working ladder, W gets worse resullt.]
;B[rc];W[re];B[pe];W[pf];B[oe];W[of];B[ne];W[qg];B[nd];W[dp]
;B[fq]C[genecyst: Would F17 be any better? Or maybe maybe shimari around R5? I think this is supposed to be a matter of taste (in amateur level) but what would you prefer?

dede: I like this move.];W[dn];B[kp]C[dede: This move is to far from F3 and from Q3. Now you have openings from both sides. I'd play K4 or J4 here.]
;W[po];B[nq]C[genecyst: Is this supposed to work well with L4?

dede: This move is passive and lets White make full use of wall around 14th line. It doesn't work fine with L4 either, because there is a huge hole between L4 and F3. I'd play some kind of pincer here, preferably the high one. May be Q8?]
;W[pk];B[pm]C[genecyst: How about this, is it too early?

dede: No, it's ok];W[om];B[pn];W[on];B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[np]
;B[mp];W[oq];B[or];W[op]
(;B[nr]C[dede: I'd play kikashi O5 first, to disrupt White's shape.]
;W[qq]C[genecyst: I already show my tactical weakness :I];B[pr]
;W[qn];B[rq];W[ro];B[rp];W[qm];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]C[dede: This move is little risky. White can try something like G17 or H17 to reduce influence from O16 stones. J17 looks better. Then, if White plays D18, Black can solidify bottom with H4.]
;W[cc];B[hd]C[genecyst: I wasn't sure about this move. How to use the thickness at O16? My plan was to invite an invasion and then push opponent against the thickness, but my opponent didn't invade after all.

dede: This move is ok, but J17 looks better to me. Look at L16 - it's hard to attack if White invades here.]

(;W[hq];B[cq]C[genecyst: Can I afford to get sealed in here? Or is it a better idea to play around C8?

dede: C3 is ok.  You can treat F3 stone as an aji and wait for an opportunity to use it somehow.
 The problem is that your territory is open from left side - L4 is too high.
 C8 is a good idea too, but you have to be realistic - White WILL get profit from the opening between F3 and L4.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[co];B[bn];W[cl];B[ho]
C[genecyst: The idea was to prevent white from creating a big moyo when I escape from near D11 (if I get to invade there).

dede: I don't like this move. What if White plays tenuki? Look variant. And there is more - this move is aji keshi.]

(;W[gp]C[dede: Now F3 lost almost all aji.]
(;B[di]C[dede: White is low on both sides - I'd play C11 here.]
;W[gl]
(;B[ff]C[genecyst: This seems like the right idea to me. Upper white corner doesn't look good to me now and white's invasion near L16 would be even tougher.

dede: Too optymistic. You can't avoid some kind of cut between F14 and D11. You should make some preparations before this move - make some shape on the left.]
;W[eg];B[fi]C[genecyst: I was aware of white's possibility of cutting but I lack tactics to handle the situation.

dede: Tictics is simple - try to make eyes as soon as possible or connect to friends.]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[gg]
(;B[fg]C[dede:This move is bad. You can't play G12 anymore. G12 or H11 are ok.]

;W[ik];B[hl];W[gm];B[hm];W[gn];B[hn]C[genecyst: I don't know who is happier now.

dede: I think White already leads.];W[jg];B[nf];W[jd];B[jc]
C[genecyst: Another move I wasn't sure about.  Looks like I cannot use my thickness well because white seems very much connected.

dede: You should ignore this move for now and play O12. Imagine that White plays O13...]

;W[ng];B[og]C[dede: N13 is better.];W[rf]
(;B[ll]C[genecyst: I thought this side would be better to reduct from. It's also a kind of honte because i was afraid of something near K4.

dede: K8 looks better to me. It makes some use of H11.];W[mg]
;B[lj];W[ni];B[cb]C[genecyst: Is the timing any good?

dede: M8 is still weak.White can counterattack from P6 side. As yose, I think J2 is bigger.]

C[dede: Now the game is over. 

dede: End of comments.];B[lk];W[jm]C[genecyst: Troublesome.]
