C[a comfortable win for white.  what could black have done?

JM: Thanks for the opportunity to review your game.  I enjoyed it very much.  Please take all of my comments with a grain of salt, as only the professionals can say definitively what the best move in any particular position is.  All of my comments are preceded by 'JM:'

From what I could tell, black made a couple of mistakes in the opening of the game that left him having to play catch-up for a majority of the time.  

I also felt that black missed a few opportunities to pressure the eyeless Q12 group.  Later, trying to attack the strong G9 group cost black further.  Overall though, with a bit more attention being paid to which groups are weak and which are strong I feel black can improve his game significantly.]

(;B[dc]C[playing it cool. the white stones to the right are not weak, but black decided erasure at K18 would be enough.  agree?

JM: Black is building strength towards the strong white stones.  It's the left side, not the top, that's interesting here.]
;W[cc];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[bg];B[ch];W[cm]
(;B[jp]C[JM: If black is interested in the bottom, it might be better to attack Q4 more directly.  This move lets white settle that corner fairly easily.]
;W[mq];B[fq];W[eq]C[JM: This gives white very nice shape :-(]
;B[fp];W[jr];B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[or];W[oq]

(;B[pc]C[JM: This sequence gives white the chance to play another move related to his Q12 stone, which is a gift for white.]
;W[od];B[pe];W[nh];B[pm]C[JM: This is good shape, but I still think the Q12/O12 stones are the interesting part here.]
;W[on];B[og];W[oh];B[mf];W[lh];B[nj];W[sn];B[om]C[too slow?

JM: If black is concerned about these stones, he should save them by pressuring M12.  Playing M10 would give him plenty of room to work with]
;W[mn];B[qg];W[qh];B[rj]C[feels very slow. black wants to play L14, but feels a need to secure the lower group first.  should he not have worried?

JM: You're usually better off trying to run before coming back to make eyespace.  With the strength of the D12 stones, black shouldn't be too scared about running with M10]
;W[pg];B[rg];W[rh];B[rc]C[slow again, but black concerned to settle upper group as a push through at L14 could end up with black being cut as well.  is this good thinking?

JM: I think black is being overly cautious here.  White likely won't cut, because it'll make his own stones too weak.]
;W[jn]C[JM: This is big.];B[fn];W[dn];B[kf]C[maybe this is not so valuable after all as white was able to strengthen the upper stones and there's no point separating two strong groups.  yet black still has a bit of an attack at the right side white group, but would it have been better to try something else here?  black feels a bit behind in secure territory but unless he attacks somewhere he will stay behind.  so what to do?

JM: I think this is good.  The M12 stones aren't all that strong yet, and black can gain from pressuring them]
;W[jh];B[jk]C[JM: This is dame.  I think H12 is more interesting.]

JM: I'm not sure any is necessary here at all (see variation)]
;W[bh];B[ff]C[JM: H14 is much more important.  It keeps white separate while also threatening to cut F15]

JM: By my approximate count it's Black: 48, White: 53.  The problem is that white has much more potential in the middle.  Black would need to play extremely well at this point to win.]
