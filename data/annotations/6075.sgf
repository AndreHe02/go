C[R: Hello! I will mark my comments by "R:". I hope you will like my advices and this will help you to improve. Of course im not a grandmaster, so no WARRANTY. :-D]
;B[pq];W[cd];B[cp];W[pc];B[pe];W[md]LB[nd:A][oe:D][qe:B][qg:C]
[ph:E]C[R: taking the corner or get outside influence would be normal. Marked places are simple joseki moves, I feel N16 is not so good in this situation. However it is definitely not a disaster ...]
;B[qc]C[R:];W[od]LB[qb:B][pd:A]C[R: Whats wrong with A? play it and exchange corner for sente (and attack another corner). even B looks interesting. 
P16 is quiet slow here. This is white's corner, white should profit more. If white try to build solid base directly without attacking,  its easy time for black...]
;B[pd]
(;W[pb]LB[oe:A]C[R: again, seems a little bit spiritless. White let black occupy the corner for free. (and 2 moves later get a shape full of ajis)

lets try to sacrify that corner for outer influence..];B[oe]
;W[nd];B[qb];W[qj];B[qh];W[qm]LB[qo:A]C[R: Its nice base, but now black can play A and get a shimari while attacking white's base in sente. 

Consider play R6 (after which A wouldnt be so good since black's deffending shape would be ideal) . Of course black can put a stone in a middle, and difficult fighting begins (but that is always good for white, isnt it? ;-)]
;B[qn];W[pn];B[qo];W[pm];B[ed];W[df]LB[gc:B][hc:A][ee:C]C[R: this joseki works nice if some white stones exists on the left side and you want to get sente quickly (var). Choose A or B to building at the top, or C for build outside strength.

Considering white strength(?) at O16 build on the 4th line, pincer would be the best. I would prefer A.]
;B[cc]
(;W[dc]C[R: White turned his mind, after trying to settle quickly fights back. Maybe ok, but difficult. Only joseki here i know would be B17 (var), but in this situation (considering O16 group) it wouldnt be too fortunate, so fight back is correct, D14 was not realy good choice.]
;B[dd];W[bc];B[cb]
(;W[ce];B[bb];W[bd]C[R: realy slow. See variation. After the exchange would you play at A? Of course not.]
;B[gc]TR[ic]C[R: there is some aji in black shape now... we can suppose he wont tenuki if you play around triangle.]
;W[ci];B[jc];W[lc]C[R: not too nice shape. It has a big weakness at O18 (in fact maybe better to play there instead) and of course as always the best way to escape to the center (make power in the center) instead of surround about 6 points in gote.]
;B[jp]C[I felt pretty much behind, now. The opening got absolutely wrong.

R: :-( Yeah. I agree. All corners are lost in gote. So close to resign, only agressive fighting would help :)]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[cr];B[cq];W[dq];B[br];W[dr];B[cm];W[gp]C[R: ok, what is your goal? Strengthening black's bottom center without too much gain is not a good idea. If you want to secure your group, simply jump out at E6.

Later we want to invade black's territory (of course :) somewhere at O3, so we dont need strong center group.]
;B[hp];W[go]C[R: slow. Dont make your group heavy. Jump out lightly, or tenuki (and pray :).]
;B[mp]CR[id][oh][dl]TR[lf][eh][nl]C[The marked points is where I thought, I could get any territory (if at all). Do you agree?

So I tried to get some walls in this direction. Obviously, it did not work

R: ok, in this stage, we can suppose black will play for territory (as he has plenty).  So try to press down as much as you can evrywhere very agressively and get the center. Marked spots seems to be escape routes to me instead of moyo builders... I would try circles for example.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[op];B[oq];W[pp];B[qp];W[po]LB[mo:A]C[R: *very* slow. White cannot afford such moves now. (please notice nothing real build by this move.)
Pressing down black at A is absolute minimum.];B[mo];W[gr]C[R: endgame move. Center/invading is most important.]
;B[hr]
(;W[gq]C[R: losing sente is a disaster now. Only option is to keep black under pressure and build large framework or (if he loses his calm :-)  defeat him in heavy fight. 

please consider, if black plays G3 you can easily connect...]
;B[bj];W[cj];B[bi];W[ck];B[bk]
(;W[bh]C[R: dont deffend, keep the pressure.];B[cl];W[dh];B[oh]
;W[ic];B[ib]C[R: black is playing deffensively, no question.]
;W[jd];B[hc]
(;W[kc]C[R: connecting much better.];B[id];W[je];B[ie];W[ne]
C[R: seems to be slow. O14 at least, but tenuki instead.];B[nf]
;W[mf];B[ng];W[el];B[dl]
(;W[dk]C[R: dont deffend in bad shape! 
let black one line more and make nice outer strength.(var)]
;B[em];W[fl];B[fm];W[gl];B[gm];W[fe];B[ee];W[ef];B[fd];W[ge]
;B[kb];W[lb]TR[if]C[R: dont stick to every piece of territory. Give that 6 points. What about J14? Which is bigger?]
;B[if];W[hg];B[hf]
(;W[gf]C[R: shape again :)];B[ig];W[hh];B[pa]C[R: of course black can play P18 here.]
;W[ob];B[oa];W[na];B[qa];W[mb]C[R: simple connect would be one less ko threat, and better shape.]
;B[pj];W[pk];B[oj];W[ok];B[qi];W[rj];B[nj];W[ik];B[mg];W[lf]
;B[lg]C[R: end of game. (in fact for long time) Black territories are secured and no center left. I made some small comments in the endgame, but here is the proper place to summarize the game. 

What next if you want to improve? My advices are: 
First of all, if you like to play komoku in corners, its worth to check basic komoku josekies. Even you can memorize three or four. Never hurts. :-)

second, If you feel you are quiet behind, *never* back down and retreat. Press down your opponent territory, be agressive and keep sente (most important). If your opponent threaten your territory always consider not to answer, try to play a bigger threat! He will give you, since he dont want to risk. Well, not one game was turned by this way :-)

Thanks for reading!
cheers,
