;W[qm];B[mq];W[rp];B[qq];W[dj];B[jq];W[gq]C[JB: K16 was probably bigger.]
;B[cp];W[co]C[JB: Good choice.  You have high stones up north, so make the outside wall.]

;B[bs];W[bm];B[jd];W[ap]C[JB: As you have probably realized, this just wastes your time and burns ko threats.]
;B[aq];W[an];B[bp];W[am];B[ao];W[eo]C[JB: Good move.
You asked for advice about handling the C4 invasion.  You handled it just fine.  You may not be happy with the result, but you came out of it at least as well as he did.  He got small territory, and you got outside influence.  Perhaps you came out of it better, for your influence may be worth more than his territory.
Remember that a hoshi stone is not a territorial stone.  It leaves the corner open.  Did you feel that you 'lost' the corner? The corner was never yours to lose.]
;B[fc]
(;W[hc]C[JB: Your first real error in judgement ( I assume that the attack on the corner was merely a slip in reading ).  This joseki would be reasonable if K16 were not there; maybe reasonable if you had a stone at D14.  But you have too many gaps to start this fight.
Your best play is probably the obscure joseki F15, which works because of your massive lower right strength.  See variation.]
;B[fe]C[JB: Now he has the fundamental go attack: splitting two weak groups.]
;W[df];B[db];W[cc]C[JB: F13 may be bigger.];B[hd]TR[fg]CR[qf]
[lc][dh]C[JB: Ok, let's take stock of the battlefield.
1) The lower half of the board is mostly resolved: You two have split the lower right 50/50, some territory and some influence for each of you; you two have split the lower left, territory for him, influence for you.  There is a little central territory around O6 to quibble over, but it is difficult to secure.  There is also a big yose point at S3, but it is gote for you, and it is way out in the boondocks.
2) The upper and left sides of the board are where the game will be won or lost.  You have the beginnings of a moyo growing up from the left; he has one emerging from the top.  There is a proverb that says 'playing at the border of two territories is worth double'.
The point marked with a triangle is that border.  A stone there serves to expand one territory and invade the other.  ( It does two things, thus it is said to be worth double )
There are several good invasion points for both sides, here marked with circles.  If you play at the triangled point, not only do you get a big play, but you effectively prevent the invasion at D12.]
(;W[lc];B[ic];W[le]
(;B[oh]C[JB: Fortunately for you he does not cap.  See variations.]
(;W[lg]C[JB: You might do slightly better to aim for your friends to the west.  See variation.]
(;B[rq];W[ro];B[kd]
(;W[ld];B[jg];W[li]C[JB: Again the kosumi at L12 may be better.]
;B[oj];W[ri];B[rh];W[ji]CR[kh][li]C[JB: Good!  You are finally running in the right direction.  But notice that the M11 stone is misplaced.  Your connections would be stronger if it were at L12 instead.
Note a similar pattern: double tobis - this time at right angles - have weaknesses.  Two moves ago, a tobi to M13 folowed by kosumi at L12 would have been stronger.]
;B[kh]C[JB: The weakness is being exploited.];W[lh];B[ki];W[kj]
;B[lj]C[JB: The double tobi has been cut.];W[mj];B[lk];W[ni]
;B[oi];W[mk];B[kk];W[ml];B[jj];W[ol]C[JB: This position is an important one.  Step back from the board, forget about the recent chase, and look at the whole board.  Black has that monsterously strong fist in the middle, which will dominate any play on the bottom or left.  Your big white wall in the lower left, which used to be the 800-pound goriilla in that quarter of the board, now faces an opponent just as strong, but better positioned.
When contesting an invasion, one of the things that a defender can do, is, of course, try to kill it.  One of the other things that he can do is chase it, let it escape. and make strength while chasing.
You played 10 stones while running.  What did you get?  You got an invasion worth maybe 30 points.  In return, he got a strong center position which may be worth more.  He also prevented any future invasion at R14, which is worth a few points.   IN THE NET, YOU LOST POINTS ON THIS INVASION.
Remeber: as the defender, you don't have to always kill the invader.  Sometimes there are other ways to profit from attcking the invasion.]
;B[mf]C[JB: A nice interlude, further securing his points to the left.  Note that this is just another variation on the idea of making strenth while attacking.]
;W[lf];B[dh]C[JB: Now the chickens come home to roost.  There is no room for black eyes here, so he will have to run.  But running is no problem because of thos powerful stones in the middle.]
;W[ch];B[cg];W[dg];B[ci]C[JB: If those were white stones in the middle, you could laugh at this, extend to B12 to keep C12 alive, and slowly crush him.]
;W[eh];B[bh];W[di];B[cj];W[ch];B[cf];W[ce];B[dh];W[ck];B[eg]
C[JB: Again, if those were white stones in the middle, this would mean nothing.  But he is actually threatening to capture E12.]

;W[mp];B[oq];W[lq];B[mr]C[JB: He should just capture.];W[lr]
;B[lp];W[mo];B[nr];W[kp];B[lo];W[ln]TR[ml][dj][ck]C[JB: A nice invasion by you.  Note that it is easily successful because of your influence: you have stones to run to, and you have the ladder breaker.  Just as his influence helped his invasion over on the left, now your influence is helping your invasion.]
;B[dk]C[JB: Hehehe..];W[cl]C[JB: Ooops!  A good rule of thumb is that ladder breakers must have three or more liberties.]
;B[no];W[ko];B[qi];W[rk];B[im];W[io];B[gm]TR[di][dj][ck][cl]
[cm][cn][co][eo]C[JB: He reduces your territory, pushing in with no risk because he is backed up by the powerful center group.  All of your stone marked with triangles are being neutralized.]
;W[ek];B[em];W[dm];B[en];W[fo];B[el];W[fk];B[fn]C[JB: He should play bamboo joint at G8, BTW.]
;W[fg]C[JB: My closing comments are here.

Among beginners, a common misunderstanding is that invasions are failures if the are killed, and successes if they live.  This is only superficially true.  Invasions are much more complicated than that.
The defender can often get more profit out of letting an invasion live, and building strenth while chasing it.  The resultant strength may be used to take territory or to attack something.

Your game has several examples of this.  The C4 invasion by black was a mistake, and you should thank him for invading ( it was premature ).  You can threaten to kill him, he will live small, and you get outside influence.  This outside influence works well with your star point stones on the left side.  The result - in the long run - should be better for you than for him. 
Unfortunately, you did not capitalize on your influence with extensions like F13.  You let it sit there undeveloped while the rest of the game slowly crawled closer to it and rendered it ineffective.  If you learn how to use influence you will welcome foolish invasions like C4.
Influence is worth a lot on an open board, and worth very little on a crowded board. In other words, it is worth more early in the game. That is why I said that the invasion was premature.  He gets his meagre five or six points regardless of when he does it.  But doing it early gives you a wall that dominates the lower left quarter of the board.
Actually, you did use it a tiny bit.  Your stones at M2/M3/L4/L5 are working very well with your strength at D2/D3/D4.  The stone at K3 never had a chance.

A second example of handling an invasion was when you invaded at M17.  It worked for him in two ways.  He chased you and got territory around R14, and he got influence in the middle of the board.  He then used that influenceto back up an invasion at D12 and a reduction with D7/F7/H7.  
Before he started chasing you, his loosely outlined territory around R14 was invadable, and he had no significant power in the center. After he chased you, he had solid territory and central influence.

Once you learn how to exploit an invasion and get the better of it despite not killing it, you will begin to realize how ineffective many invasions are, and you will look toward reducing from the outside.

In summary:
1) There is more to invading than just living or dying.
2) Influence only is good for you if you actively use it.
3) Most kyu players choose invasions too much and reductions too little.
4) When running, try to avoid double tobis; use tobi and kosumi combos.

Hope this helps.
