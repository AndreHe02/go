;B[pd]C[WarMachine [2d\]: Very short game just need help to understand this variation of large avalnche.

Hi, my name is Greg. I took a look and added a bunch of variations. The key move is Move 31. You missed a chance since white's variation was a mistake. At your level, you should be able to understand all this pretty quickly. Just needs some reading.]
