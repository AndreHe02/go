C[Hello dear reviewer!

I'm playing Black.
I've posted my doubts/questions within the game.
The main questions are about the opening and possible moves @ 36.
Also question @ 80 and 122.
@ 170 I have a life and death question of the bottom White group.
I've preceded all comments with my name.
Feel free to answer them or not...maybe I'm just missing the whole picture ; )

Thanks in advance and have fun!

(;B[dd]C[Usually, you want to play with a stone facing the 3-4 point, like the variation.]
;W[pp];B[dj];W[qj];B[nq];W[oq]LB[no:A][np:B]C[Fred: I played A in the game I think b is more standard but not see why? Is it weaker?

A is a mistake since it's not solid and white can peep later or use it as aji. White P3 is a mistake because if you had played B you would have had a very solid base, A is used in this shape, but never in this situation.]

(;B[no];W[pn];B[jq];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[fn];B[dl]C[No need to be so protective there, you should either keep attacking by plaing K6 or tenuki.]
;W[cc]
(;B[dc]C[Fred: is this the right direction?

No, it pushes the white stone right into your potential territory and makes you overconcentrated]

;W[bg];B[ch];W[bh];B[ci];W[pe]LB[jd:B][jn:A]C[Fred I played A to pressure the White group.
Is playing the side extension at B bigger?

A is pretty huge, and because of your incredibly huge wall, you have good chance of killing white, or at least destroying his influence on the right]
;B[jn];W[jd]LB[jb:D][jf:C][jj:E][hq:B][gr:A]TR[fn][fp][fq]C[Fred: What would be the biggest move now or what are the different options?

A or B to cut off White's base
C to limit White's moyo
D as a side extension and to scoop out the base of K16
E to make a moyo with the left side and a kind of connection with the K6 group

White obviously plays a big move with K16.

E would be best, since it attacks the white stones and expands your territory, even if wG2 bE2 wH3, there's still a good chance black could kill the white group. Also note that D isn't a very good move.]

(;B[jf]C[A high cap like this only works if you have stones underneath, this just invites white to invade at H14.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[hq];B[hp];W[gp];B[fr];W[ep]LB[dq:A][er:B]C[Fred: Do I have to protect the cutting points at A and B?

Definitely, and the best way to do this and attack the white group is G2, since E4 is a mistake.]

B prevent W from entering B's moyo
C trying to kill W's group
D stop group from expanding
E extend moyo

What are good moves here?

First of all, A was a bad move, but white didn't punish you correctly, see variation. C does not kill the group. B is better at J15, see variation.]
