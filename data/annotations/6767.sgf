bearkid [3k\]: hi];B[pd]C[Hello!

Thank you very much for reviewing this game, I hope it is (a bit) enjoyable... Tapir.

Hi Tapir,

I have added some remarks and variations throughout the game.

Michaeljohn (inimino)];W[pq];B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pn];W[nq]

(;B[pj]C[inimino: This feels a bit too close, Q11 would be better balance with Q16 in my opinion.  That is not to say this is a bad move.. just another idea to think about.]
;W[dc];B[dp];W[cn];B[fq];W[bp];B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[cj]
;W[do];B[cp];W[bq]C[inimino: I am not familiar with this "joseki"...]
;B[bn];W[bo];B[co];W[dn];B[bl];W[ep];B[cr];W[eq];B[dr];W[er]
;B[br];W[dq];B[cq];W[iq];B[dk]C[Tapir: White misplayed the corner, I felt very comfortable.

inimino: Yes.];W[cg]C[Tapir: Isn't this better played at C14?

inimino: Perhaps, but to me O17 is bigger so I think this direction is probably a mistake for white.]
;B[fk]C[inimino: This feels a bit small.  I think the top side is now the biggest area, perhaps around L17.  If there were some risk to the D9 group, this move would make sense, but there is not.  It does give white an excuse to resolve the aji around E5, but for black this move does little in my opinion.]
;W[gn];B[jn];W[jl]C[Tapir: This move surprised me, while I play the cap often, I did not
expect it here. Is it playable?

inimino: To me, both K6 and K8 moves were a little bizarre.  I am not sure what the players are thinking about in this area, but to me the interesting part of the board is still around G17/L17/O17.  Even here as b I will tenuki and take the top rather than concern myself with the smaller things going on here.]
;B[im];W[gl];B[il];W[jk];B[ik];W[jj];B[ln]C[inimino: Again I think black should play on the top rather than take this move in an area that does not represent points for either side.]
;W[ml];B[kq];W[io];B[ni]C[Tapir: Is this a viable move? Is there a better one around?

inimino: This move looks a little unusual, but the idea to put pressure on the weak white floating group is certainly sound.

Another more indirect way to do the same thing would be to play on the top around L16 which also starts to stake out territory there while limiting the extension white can make from the upper left.]
;W[pl];B[ol]C[Tapir: I read about forcing at Q4 first, but didn't dare here... Should
I? Is P8 reasonable?

inimino: I suspect that S8 is better locally.  You are trying to cut the white stones, which means this is starting on the wrong side.  In this kind of sacrifice-a-stone-to-cut-and-connect play you will end up on the other side than the side you start on.  If you can end up with a connection between Q6 and Q10 while white has a weakened group still floating in the center and an unalive ponnuki around R8, that would seem to be a good result.

Briefly looking at Q4 I can't see that it does anything helpful for black here.]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[om]
(;B[ql]C[Tapir: I now feel this is a mistake, since all ladders are working for
Black O8 might be the best way, but I'm not sure about. After White
O8 the center group became solid.

inimino: It seems that O8 is not a complete disaster, but on the other hand, it is an odd result.  If you are going to play O8, it seems that P8 did not make sense.  To me the most obvious and likely result of P8 is this position, so if you are going to play P8 I think you should follow through and treat is as a sacrifice.  If you play O8 here, then I wonder why you played P8 at all.]
;W[nl];B[mj]C[Tapir: Is this move reasonable?

inimino: I still think the top is much bigger.  White can play at O5 to connect, or can run out, so if white plays around K17 now I think this move will look a little silly.]
;W[km];B[jo];W[jp];B[kp];W[kn];B[ko];W[ij];B[gk]
(;W[fl]C[Tapir: Can White play the wedge at H9 instead?

inimino: The variations after H9 are a little involved but it is quite easy for black to make life or connect, so H9 is not much benefit for white.]
;B[hj]C[inimino: If you are concerned here about the life of the black group, I would try to live or connect in a more active way.  Perhaps black can try P4, J2, and O6.  This particular move just feels a little passive.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]C[Tapir: Better at O17 next?

inimino: Possibly.  It makes better use of the stones at N10 and O11.]

(;B[nb];W[nc];B[od];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[qb];W[me]C[inimino: This is not a bad result, but the question now is, how to deal with the situation on the top side?  It is still open enough for black to invade easily, which is the most obvious and may be the best approach.]
;B[nf]C[Tapir: Slow?

inimino: Yes, and encourages white to close the top, which is much worse.]
;W[if]C[inimino: A little ambitious, but clearly this move throws a challenge to black, who must now find something special to stay in the game.]
IT[];B[ee]C[Tapir: I now try hard to bring myself into trouble... :(

inimino: I would probably prefer to play a little differently here, but the way to invade or reduce is probably a matter of taste and individual skill more than anything.  The best advice would be to avoid this difficult situation by playing in this area on black's previous move.

Regardless of how you handle this, however, it is pretty likely that this invasion will live.]
;W[eg];B[ce];W[bc];B[ff];W[fg];B[fc];W[ej];B[ek]C[inimino: Rather than simply connect here, I would play at least E18 first, and then probably make sure the top group is alive.  If white cuts, the center black stones can still connect to Q5.]
;W[eb];B[gf];W[hh];B[ie];W[hf];B[he];W[jc];B[je];W[kg];B[jf]
;W[jh];B[gg];W[gh];B[lf];W[kf];B[ke];W[le];B[jg];W[ig];B[kh]
;W[lg]C[inimino: Clearly, the stone at M14 itself is not very interesting.  Much better to sacrifice it.  K11 leads to an interesting fight which seems better for black than the game line.]

(;B[mf];W[lh];B[ki];W[li];B[ld]C[inimino: Perhaps L17 directly would be cleaner here.]
;W[md];B[kc];W[lc];B[ic]C[tapir [3k\]: re

inimino: Why not play L18 here and try a ko?];W[kd];B[fb];W[dd]
;B[de]C[Tapir: Black maybe alive now, but this invasion was not gentle at all.
How could I have done better?

inimino: I hope I answered this with the remarks on previous moves.]
;W[nh];B[oh];W[oi]C[Tapir: Very unexpected to me. the result was very bad for black.
Q12 next, or forcing with M10 / N12 possible?

inimino: N12 is natural, however your Q11 is also playable, your next move after Q11 was the real mistake.]

(;B[pi];W[og]C[inimino: Q12 was too passive, N12 here seems correct, see variation.]

(;B[ph];W[ng]C[inimino: Obviously a bad result for black, the error seemed to be not thinking about how to use the aji of the black stones at L11 and L12.]
;B[pg];W[of];B[pf];W[oj];B[cb]C[Tapir: More reading required... Can Black kill here?

inimino: I think not.];W[db];B[bb];W[bd];B[be];W[ab]

;B[ho];W[hn];B[in];W[ip];B[hp];W[is];B[jq];W[ir];B[gr]
(;W[lr]C[Tapir: Can Black do anything if White plays G4 instead?

inimino: I think not, but there are many mistakes in this sequence, and black gives up some amazing opportunities in the next ten moves.]
BM[1];B[kr];W[ks];B[gs];W[ls];B[es]C[inimino: At this point the white group is dead and the game should be over.

Note that black could also have played H1 followed by N2 here.]
;W[gp];B[fp]
(;W[go]
(;B[eo]C[inimino: Another huge mistake, here black gives up about 50 points.  If black plays G3 instead, not only is the white group killed but white must also defend against black N2 which captures 11 stones more.]
;W[gq];B[ib];W[jb];B[ae];W[cc];B[ea];W[da]C[Tapir: Shame on me...]
;B[fa];W[bh];B[dh];W[dg];B[ei];W[fi];B[fj];W[di];B[eh];W[ch]
;B[dj];W[ci];B[en];W[fm]C[Tapir: After several crude black endgame plays earlier, how is the balance now? In my count the game is about even now.

inimino: I agree the game is about even.]
(;B[lm];W[lo]C[inimino: This move is very bad.  Black must now play K11 and L8 immediately, and can again create a ko which is very unpleasant for white.]
;B[mo];W[lp]
(;B[lq];W[mp];B[mq];W[np];B[mr]C[Tapir: Trying to make the best out of M8... however...

inimino: A complete disaster for black, though the K11/L8 aji is still there it seems both players were unaware of it.]
;W[hp]C[Tapir: Unnecessary?

inimino: Yes.];B[qq];W[rq];B[qr];W[pr]
(;B[rp];W[ro];B[rr];W[sr];B[or];W[oq]C[inimino: K11 now would win the game for black.]
;B[sn]C[inimino: This is nothing, and lowers the possibility of the connection at O6.]
;W[rs];B[on];W[nn];B[ms];W[js];B[oe];W[ne];B[hi];W[ii]C[inimino: At this point black removed the possibility of the ko, so the game is almost certainly for white.]

[ap][bp][bq][ar][as][bs][cs][ds][fs]C[Tapir: I like to know something more general about the game. Which areas of my play are exceptionally weak i.e. improvable? Did you like this game?

I thank you very much for taking so much time to review this game. Thank you, Tapir.

inimino: The major areas for improvement seem to be in fighting, particularly in the use of aji and awareness of your opponent's weaknesses.  In this game black passed up many great opportunities to destroy the opponent's position during the last two thirds of the game.  I think if you pay more attention to the opportunities to attack and to make flexible use of your own stones (even if they appear dead) you will become a better player and your games will feel more dynamic and exciting.

I enjoyed this game and it was fun to review it, thank you for submitting this game to the GTL!
