C[C: Hi, I'm Charlie and I'll be doing the game review. My strength is about 2-dan, based on playing in Japan. I'll give my opinion, but keep in mind there are stronger players out there and my comments will be influenced by my personal playing style. There's always more than one good move! I'll mark my comments with a "C" so you know it's me.

To my dear reviewer,

thanks for taking this review. I'm white in this game and ended losing by 2,5 points. I didn't thought the game was this close (my bad for not counting) and didn't try to fight in the yose.
Please can you point my biggest mistakes and what are the points I have to work on ?

My opponent Hagalaz would like to have a review to for his side :) He thanks you too for the time you'll spend on this.

Many thanks from both of us !

See you !];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq]
(;W[hq]
(;B[cq]C[C: Black's joseki choice in this position is not very good. In the standard joseki (the one that's played in this game), black ends in gote, which gives white a perfect approach at P4. Black should consider the shimari at P3 or O3. White must play around R10, which lets black continue in the corner.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[nc]C[C: White must take advantage of his wall and play P4!]
;B[pf]C[C: Black misses his chance as well. O3 is still the biggest point.]
;W[jd];B[qj]C[C: Again, O3 is the biggest point. R10 is also too slow. White has not made the exchange at Q18 and S17 yet. Black should not worry about the possibility of white playing R12, or else he should've responded with the knight's move instead of the one-point jump. Black should consider the invasion at F17, as it is already clear that white is playing for influence.]
;W[cl];B[dn]C[C: I would rather play at C7 here, as the sequence that follows completely destroys the aji of the F3 stone.]
;W[en];B[em];W[fn]
(;B[fm]C[C: It's probably best to play at D8 directly.]
(;W[gn];B[dm]C[C: D8 is more solid here.]
(;W[dj]C[C: This move is a bit too close to the black wall. P4 is even more important than before, as the white thickness on the left side is quite large. Locally, you should consider C11, D11, C13, or D14. The fourth-line plays are probably better, as they work well with your K16 stone.]
(;B[cf]C[C: I can't stress the importance of O3 enough. It has been the biggest point since the fifth move and neither player has taken it yet. Locally, however, this is a good move by black, taking advantage of his wall on the lower left to attack the two white stones.]
;W[ch];B[cc]C[C: This is the most well-known joseki, but black should consider playing at C16 instead.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[bf];W[df]C[C: E13 is the correct move. Now, black has the possibility of cutting at D13.]
;B[pb]C[C: A big move, taking corner profit and setting up the invasion at M17. I wonder why black hasn't played O3 yet though.]
;W[ob];B[pc];W[ne];B[oq]C[C: Yes! This is the biggest point!]
;W[qh]C[C: There is no need to invade this deeply, plus this is the wrong direction. It is enough for white to continue building the moyo at P13. Later, white has the possiblity of sabaki plays at Q3, S4, or R7 to reduce the right side.]
;B[og];W[pi];B[pj];W[oi]C[C: Very slow, the one-point jump at O11 is better.]
;B[nk];W[mi];B[mg];W[oo]C[C: Defending your weak group is urgent. Note that black's moyo is a result of attacking your weak group, which says something about the R12 invasion in the first place.]
;B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[mq]C[C: This move is better at N4. The sequence that follows makes white's big wall useless.]

(;B[kj]C[C: Black misses a chance to finish the game here. White cannot save his group after K10 on the tengen point.]

[ld][lr][ls][ma][md][na][nb]C[C: To summarize. The bottom right corner was the most important point in the fuseki. I can't really emphasize this enough. Apart from that, the game was generally clean except for white's questionable invasion on the right and black's missed opportunity to capture the white group in the center.

What I noticed from this game, and what I would recommend to both players, is to practice using thickness. In almost all joseki, you make the choice to trade territory for influence, but it seems in this game that none of this influence was used well. White misses the chance to use the influence in both the bottom-left and top-left, and black as well in the bottom-left with his wall facing the top. One interesting thing both players might want to try is to play handicap games from both sides. Handicap games from black's perspective is all about using the power of star-point stones, while playing as white helps you learn how to negate this influence.]
