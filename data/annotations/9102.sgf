Your oppentent takes advantage of it in the next move, by developing along the top.]

The bottom white group is settled. A or B would put pressure on the top group.
It would be worth having a plan to take of care of invasions on the squared positions .  

C would complete the chinese fuseki and yield an even board position (up to white having the initiative, due to your misclick)

D10 does not put any pressure anywhere.
When invading the left side, I would play in the middle between the two stones on _third_ line, to make a base, see variation.]

Now, do you have to respond to this move?
Is Q16 in danger, e.g. by white's move on the squared position?
No. 

So it's time to play elsewhere: A-E come to mind.
E has the added benefit of threatening to separate the top white groups and you already have invested 7 stones in the wall (it's white's next move).]

What to play here?

The lines I have drawn here on the board, mark (approximate) borders of influence (power). This is where the action is going to happen. You should try to push white back as far as possible. If you were white, where would you play? These are also good points for you too play.  

In addition, making a base for the triangled group at A is possible. This would help, when playing where the squares are (see variation).

Still, there's this weakness where your triangles are.]

Contact moves are for defending. They make strong groups - for both parties. 

You want to attack: Don't touch, what you're going to eat. Play moves robbing eye space from the white group (see variations)

Review your attack on the invasion in the bottom right: Did you play contact moves?
Could you have played eye robbing moves instead?]

* Bottom black group, cancels white's bottom right group.
* white has large bottom left and top left territory (about 5x3 and 7x3 points).
* You need to make center territory. This is difficult, as you experience.

You are behind by about 35 points of secure territory.

You have influence (power) facing the center, which is faced by similar power.
Action takes place at the marked line, as the following moves show.]

But you lost around 15 points at triangles. So in total you secured 20 points.

This is not enough. 
According to our rough estimate, white's still in the lead by 15 + captured stones.

Let's count again:
* squares are 35 points, 
* top territory of white is around 40 points.
* top right cancels bottom left territory.
* bottom group cancels bottom right group. 

white's in the lead by ~10 points + prisoners.

How to improve your play:

- Do not try to kill by contatct moves, try to kill by robbing eye space.
- Keep calm and think twice, if time limits allow. Practice tsumego. Both to avoid hiccups like L1.
- In the opening, make sure each move has a clear purpose.
