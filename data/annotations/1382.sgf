AB[pd][dd][dp][pp]N[Steve]C[I usually play this opponent, but with no advantage. This was the first time I had been given an advantage. Was the fuseki strong or weak? I felt I could have done better, but I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.
With a four stone advantage I was planning to build solid walls where I already had the advantage and use that strength to push through into new territory... This was a dissapointing game for me, especially when I lost the top right corner through a few bad moves.]

C[Thought i was doing good here, would a better move have been C7, C10 or H4?

I think that if you want to play in the upper side, A was more agressive and a better extension from you wall.
I'm not sure you need to answer white move in the lower corner : you can take sente now]
;W[fq];B[ck];W[ci]LB[bg:A][cm:B]N[Steve]C[I didn't like this move - should I ignore it or respond to it? If I should respond should I cap at D11?

You must answer.

I think it's not a good move for white, who still needs to defend the other white stones : black can play A or B

D11 doesn't seem good to me : don't play close to white if you want to attack, prefer to lean on some other white stone before to launch your attack]
;B[pj];W[dm];B[lp]LB[jq:A]N[Steve]C[This was quite bold for me, i was extending into apparant nothingness. Looking back now though it was a good move - do I have white-phobia?

You should take black C9 (-> E9) and D4 (->F4) out, first.
Anyway, if you want to invade, A is better, otherwise white can extend at A. Your attack is not very effective, because white can go into the corner, but you can't make any territory in the lower side]
;W[no]C[Playing in the san-san seems better to me];B[mp]LB[pq:A]
N[Steve]C[Should I have pushed here, moving to cut. Should I have strengthened elsewhere?

Close the corner at A !];W[pl];B[np]C[OK, now];W[nm];B[oq]N[Steve]
C[My thoughts here are that I should secure the corner. I thought with this push he would respond leaving me with Sente.]
;W[mr];B[nr]LB[jq:A]N[Steve]C[I felt like I had him on the run down the side here so I continued... Good move??

A seems better if you want to kill white : just take it easy]
;W[kq];B[mn]C[why ? you just strenghten white ! You still have your stones to get out !]
;W[nn];B[ol]LB[qm:A][ql:B]C[Maybe A (or B) is better to steal white base and make him run away.]
;W[ml]LB[om:A]C[white abandons his stone : then take it at A !]
;B[mm]N[Steve]C[Playing tactical early - good move??

Very bad move : you can't cut, you just make white strong.

Try to get rid of contact move when you want to attack !];W[nl]
;B[ok];W[oo];B[mo];W[po];B[qo];W[pm];B[om];W[lk];B[qm]N[Steve]
C[Move to stop white msking eye shape. Good move? Or was there something bigger?

It's useless because, white can't make eyeshape on the side]
;W[lm];B[jp];W[jq];B[hq];W[fo];B[ph]LB[cq:A]C[you should not abandon the lower left corner so easily : it's very big for white. ou can still play A to live.]
;W[ne]LB[jf:A][pc:B][cq:C]C[At this point, white should think hard : black is big on the right : about 50 points ; white is big on the lower left (still one move to play) : 30 points, plus 10 points in the upper left corner.

Black can still make a nice moyo in the upper side (A) = +20 points, or close the upper right corner (B) = 10 points, or live in the lower left corner (C) = -30 points for white.

I'm not sure white has made a good evaluation of the situation]
;B[le]LB[lc:A][kd:B][pc:C][je:D]N[Steve]C[In hindsight this was a move too late.

It's not a good move : see earlier. and also because white can play A, threatening to cut at B.  You could have play C, then white A, then black D : you close the corner and built your moyo in the upper side, making white little.]
;W[ng];B[mi]N[Steve]C[I felt like i was now defending my whole top & right side.

You're playing like you just want to kill white, but your stones are not playing together. Try to make double aim move : extend your territory and make white little : don't think you'll kill him.]
;W[lg]LB[pb:A][lc:B]C[not good for white : he should build eyespace : A and B]
;B[mf];W[nf];B[mg];W[mh];B[lh];W[lf]C[not good : white is calling for a hard attack against his group. That is suicide.]
;B[me];W[kh]LB[nh:A]C[??. Why not A ?];B[nh];W[li];B[lr]LB[mh:A]
MA[lf][lg][kh][li]N[Steve]C[I have no idea why I did this! Small time stuff, there was probably bigger moves. I'm still thinking tactically - fighting battles and not strategically!

I think you should connect immediatly at A. Then white X stones would be under hard attack and it gives the opportunity to build a big territory in the upper side.]

[me][mf][mg]N[Steve]C[Should I have played K15?

I prefer A that close your upper side but pay attention to your X stones which are not yet connected]
;W[jd];B[kg];W[mh];B[kk];W[ll]MA[ml][nl][nm][nn][no][oo][po]
[ke][le][kg][me][mf][mg]LB[lh:A]C[I think white should not answer : his X group is dead. He should play at A and fight to kill black X group]
;B[lh]LB[jk:A]C[No ! Now you must play A];W[on];B[qn];W[mh]
;B[is];W[hs];B[lh];W[jk];B[km]N[Steve]C[Just a move to give me Sente so i could take the group at M14. I felt like I was loosing the top corner again and needed to take this group to secure it. It didn't work.

Why wait ? Just take it now];W[jl];B[kf];W[ie];B[nd]LB[hd:A]
[pc:B]N[Steve]C[Voted worst move in the whole game by Steve. What do you think?

I don't like it either, but it's far from being the worst :-)
Make white run : A or B. B is better];W[od];B[mc];W[md];B[mb]

Ho yes !  :-)];B[oe]LB[qd:A]C[better A];W[qd];B[qe];W[pe];B[of]

;B[oh]LB[rh:A]N[Steve]C[Was this the correct move? He continued to take the edge! I felt a bit foolish with the last 10 or so moves.

Ho yes ! Anyway A was better];W[qh];B[rg]C[???????!!!];W[rh]

;W[fl];B[cn];W[dn];B[cp]MA[fl][dn]N[Steve]C[Could you show me how i could better take the corner here?

This way is ok. but white should have killed you instead of playing X.

Earlier you could have played in the san-san];W[cm];B[bo];W[bn]
;B[an]LB[co:A][bm:B][dr:C]C[no ! just connect at A : white must play B, then you play C. Or if white tries C, you play B and live]

N[Steve]C[Would E10 or J10 have been better?

You just lose one point !];W[bj];B[cj];W[bk];B[bd];W[bc];B[ar]
;W[sh];B[ls]CR[ls]C[In conclusion :
- play more natural moves with double meaning : attack and defend, but evitate tricky moves. Obvious ones are often the bests.
- make your stones work together
- don't attack with contact play
- don't try to kill opponent groups : just chase them away, extending your territory

Hope I've been helpful ... and not too critical !])
