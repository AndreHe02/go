C[Hi, I'm your reviewer

My name is Pavel. I will mark my comments as P:];B[qd];W[dd]

(;B[pp];W[dq];B[od]C[I use this opening a lot, sometimes with a komoku on the bottom (per variation).

Do you like one over the other? (Bottom right hoshi vs. komoku)

P: I use same strategy quite frequently];W[qj];B[do]TR[dj]LB[cm:a]
[cl:b]C[P: Not sure, that it's good idea to attack here, since white can pincer you at A or B and effecively use  her D16 stone. I would place my stone around triangled point]
;W[cm];B[fp];W[co];B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cq];B[qm];W[qg]
(;B[kq]TR[dn][dm][pk][ek]C[Is this okay?

P: I belive yes, since it gives you a chance to buid quite big moyo, even if your opponent takes the corner.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[I have a plan to fight for the bottom. Does this plan violate the proverb "don't use thickness to make territory directly"?

Not sure how to use thickness, in other words.

P: Think about thikness as about a wall, if you have two such walls facing each other, it's most likely that you will gain teritory between them, since your enenmy will be unable to survive betwen them.]

(;B[fc]SQ[rl][qm][rm]C[What about approaching from the other side?  Or higher?

Or what about saving the marked stones?  I didn't bother because it looked like all the white groups were alive.

P:  As I wrote above the marked stones are worthless, and by trying to save them you caused destruction of your really big moyo. You should have secured your moyo, and go to attack upper left corner as you do here.]

(;B[ie]TR[jf][jg][kh][ki]C[Is this the right direction?  I didn't want to catch a hane on the head, but the next sequence made me sad to.

P: Going to the center is not right, from my point of view. Since you will not gain much territory there, because of living white group which can spoil a lot of territory by it's "tentacles"]
