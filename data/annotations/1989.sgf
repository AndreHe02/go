;B[pc]C[My friend (Erion) and I (Pepin) presume being around 28k eachself.
We had a game on a 19x19 goban we'd like to be reviewed.

I (Pepin) played White and Erion played black.

Could you tell us after reviewing if we really seems to be 28k ?

After just a quick review, I would say 25k is a fair estimate with a range of maybe 30k-20k. It is well known that it is hard to precisely rate high kyu players, especially based on one game. One reason for this is that a really good player has to be strong in all areas of the game, while a weaker player may be strong in some areas and weak in others. If the game takes a turn toward ideas that you understand well, you will look better and vice versa. The best way to find out is to play more rated players. In the process your game will improve and you will then know your rating with more certainty for 2 reasons!

I try to comment about a lot of moves so that you can get the most out of the review. I think that keeping 2 things in mind will improve the play for both of you a great deal. 1) Try to be more mindful of opportunities for you or your opponent to map out big spheres of influence that extend from a side into the center. 2) Try to be alert for a chance to harass a weak group. You don't have to kill it for it to be helpful in accomplishing 1).

Mark  fess on IGS];W[cp];B[qp];W[dc];B[qe]C[Good reasonable opeing moves.]
;W[dn]LB[ep:A][eq:B]C[A or B are more classic corner enclosures, but I wouldn't call this move bad.]
;B[oq];W[hp]LB[jp:A][kq:B]C[I like a wider extension to A better, but if you could this move up with a move at B, it would look good.]
;B[df];W[ee]LB[ce:A]TR[df]C[I don't like this move  A would be better both in terms of a corner enclosure and an attack on b's triangle stone.]
;B[jc]C[This is a good answer to w's move. It is a good extension and it takes away the only good aspect of w's move, influence across the top.]
;W[dj];B[qj]TR[ee][dn][hp]C[I like b's play a little better to this point. The corner enclosures and extensions are all classic ideal moves.
w's triangle moves are not horrible, but they have an "experimental" feel to them]
;W[pm]LB[kq:A]C[Not a bad move, but I would like to see w play A.]
;B[ef];W[cf]LB[de:A]C[This move would be good if there was a white stone at A. It would then be a "hane at the head of 2 stones".]
;B[mc]TR[jc]LB[gc:A][kq:B][lq:C]C[This is the first of many overly conservative moves that both sides make. A move at A would have the dual purpose of strengthening b's triangle point and approaching w's somewhat disorganized corner. B or C are good because w wants to play there. They are good extensions for either side.]
;W[hc]C[Good!];B[lq]C[Good!];W[jr]LB[jq:A]C[A is more classic to stop b's advance along the bottom and defend w's area of influence. The game move leaves more weaknesses in w's position.]
;B[ph]LB[oj:A][nj:B]TR[pm]C[Another way too conservative move. A or B are powerful moves that map out a big moyo in the upper right while attacking w's triangle stone. You seldom get a chance to play such moves!]
;W[jp]LB[jq:A][oj:B][ln:C][mh:D][hf:E]TR[pm]SQ[df][ef]C[This move just shows how 2 moves have been invested to do what one move at A would do.
 At this point I feel a need to do something in conjunction with the triangle stone to keep b from taking over the whole right side. Something like B-D. Another idea is something like E to attack b's square stones while moving into the center.]
;B[ib]TR[pm]C[This is a good move for later, but attacking the triangle stone is still bigger now.]
;W[ic];B[dh]C[b does want to do what he can with these stones and this is not a bad way to go about it.]
;W[ch];B[hb];W[gb];B[fi]LB[de:A]C[This makes nice shape for b's stones. I would like to see A before w closes this hole, but timing is everything.]
;W[jn]LB[lo:A]C[A is far better! Holds b down and aims at rescueing lone stone.]
;B[ei]LB[fk:A][de:B][cg:C][qn:D][nl:E][ol:F]C[b has so many better moves. A-F for example.]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[cg];B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[kr]C[This is an endgame move. Too small for this stage of game.]
;W[nm]TR[pm]LB[oj:A]C[One could argue about whether or not this w's best use of his triangle stone, but b has now lost some of his opportunity to attack it. I still like A better.]
;B[el]C[Good! Reduces size of w's sphere of influence.];W[dl]
;B[gm]C[Good! Make shape while aiming at w's corner.];W[il]
;B[fm]LB[mj:A]C[Way too conservative. A move like A is still awfully big.]
;W[hm]LB[nj:A][fp:B]C[This move is small too. A or B are better.]
;B[mo];W[lm];B[rn];W[rm];B[qm];W[ql];B[ok]LB[qn:A][qm:B][mj:C]
[lj:D]C[A move on this side is really bigger than connecting at A, but if b wasn't going to connect he shouldn't have played B in the first place.  C or D is better than the game move because they map out a bigger moyo.]
;W[mk]LB[mj:A][mi:B][lh:C]C[Right idea but I would have gone to A,B, or C to really get out there.]
;B[pk]LB[mi:A]C[A is way better.];W[pl]LB[mh:A]C[Just take b's stone if you are going to play here. It strenthens your position and threatens to take another stone. A is big.]
;B[rk];W[nl]C[These stones are already strong enough not to get separated.]
;B[ni]LB[mi:A]C[A is better, but this is the right idea.];W[mi]
;B[fp]C[Good!];W[fq];B[qn];W[jd]LB[hi:A]C[Not a bad move. This is more of a threat than either of you seems to realize. Also together with moves like A it could build territory in the center while attacking b's group on the left.]
;B[pn]C[This is small. Neither side is going to gain much in this congested corner. Questionable whether top should be neglected. See alternate line for w from here.]

(;W[om]TR[nm][nl][pm][pl]C[A worthless move  The bamboo joint of the triangled stones is a rock solid connection already. See alternate for a move of some value.]
;B[fe]C[Good! b needs to worry about his group here.];W[dd]
;B[fd];W[fc];B[he]LB[ii:A]C[Good for b to still look after his group, but A probably does more damage to w while still helping b's group just as much.]
;W[kc];B[jb];W[jf];B[kb];W[id]LB[hi:A]C[A is much bigger! Maps out territory and threatens b's left side group.]
;B[lc];W[ke]C[I don't know that this is any better than just connecting.]
;B[hj]LB[ii:A]C[Good, b needs another move here, but I still think A would be interesting.]
;W[ij];B[ih];W[jh]LB[me:A]C[w A might be better. w's center is probable the same either way, but A would hurt b more.]
;B[me];W[hh]
(;B[gi]LB[gh:A][gg:B]C[This opens up the possibility of a big do or die fight. See alternate next move for w. A or B are safer for b.]

(;W[hi];B[lg]LB[gg:A]C[This is good move by itself, but w's eye stealing tesuji at A is even more serious now.]
;W[mf]
(;B[nj]LB[lg:A]C[w has challenged b's move at A and is threatening to invade. This move is beside the point. See alternates here.]
;W[mh];B[mj];W[lj];B[lf];W[mg];B[le];W[kf]LB[of:A]C[This is small. Hurt b with A.]
;B[hk];W[ld]C[This is no place to start a ko. Just connect if you are going to play here.]
;B[md];W[kd];B[hl]LB[gg:A]C[A is still the vital point.];W[ik]
;B[gn];W[ek]C[w challenges b's eye space.];B[go];W[gg];B[gj]

(;W[fg]LB[ed:A]C[Worthless move. This is a dame point. Connect at A to keep pressure on b.]
;B[kh];W[ki];B[nf];W[li]LB[dp:A]C[You will probably need to play here eventually, but it is not urgent now. A is far better.]
;B[do];W[dp]LB[co:A]C[A is better. b wants to play on A more.]
;B[en]LB[co:A]C[b can get his eyes (see earlier alternate) so A is better.]
;W[co]C[good.];B[eo];W[cm]LB[dm:A]C[Too fancy. You will have to play at eventually anyway so just do so now.]
