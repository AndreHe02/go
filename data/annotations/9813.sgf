AB[dd][pp]C[Hi, in general I think you played a good game.

I think you're too timid - you almost always respond to your opponents moves. In few cases, you take a small chunk where taking a big one would be as easy.

You should work on your yose - making sure you play sente moves before gote moves will make your endgame two stones better.]

(;B[fo]C[This is OK, although you're getting into a sequence you're not familiar with - as demonstrated later.
It would be perfectly fine to just jump into the corner and stick to what you probably already know.

;W[fc];B[cf];W[qn]C[Here's one thing to remember. After the joseki played in the upper right, the right side becomes small for both players. There's not much territory to be had there. But the bottom is potentially big for you.]

Since you lost the game by 3.5, it most probably could be won in yose.
In yose, it's crucial to play sente moves first. You gain points, the opponent has to respond, and you get to play elsewhere, making more points. Every time you lose sente or fail to take it when you should, you're losing points, and in this case - the game.

So what would happen if you didn't respond to this?]

How about (1) and (2)? By the way, they are both sente for you, so you would have two more. Hmm.

(3) and (4) are just examples. My point here is that playing big sente moves swings the result by much more than 3.5 points. This would change the result of the game.]
