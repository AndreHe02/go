RE[B+9.5]

C[Matt: Hello, and thank you for reviewing. I played this game against a 4k on Tygem and won (+9.5) as black, but I was wondering how I could've played better. I will start my questions with "M".]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn]
;B[kp]C[M: I wanted white to invade, if white dared to, and attack the white stones in a way that would help me build influence on the bottom, while waiting for an opportunity to play o16... does this plan seem rational? would a normal move at k4 or k3 been better?

klin: Of course k3 or k4 better.];W[od];B[pf];W[po];B[qm];W[qq]
;B[qr];W[qp];B[nq]C[klin: O3 shoul P2];W[rr];B[pr]C[M: was this too passive and/or overconcentrated? I wanted to keep white from settling...

klin: The shape is bad because of O3.];W[qn]C[klin: W R6 a bad move, only helping B.]

(;B[nk]C[M: would n8 be better in this case? was o9 too passive? i thought things may get complicated... and i don't really like complication.

klin: Did you say earlier you played L4 because you wanted to attack?  Now you said you don't want the ccomplication?  Of course N8 better.]
;W[sq];B[ro];W[rn];B[rm];W[sm];B[sl];W[sn];B[rk];W[oh]C[klin: Now if B S4, W does not have two eyes.]
;B[nf];W[mh];B[lf];W[mk]C[klin: B followed W's move and missed the opportunity.]

;B[pg];W[ph];B[qh];W[qi];B[rh];W[oj];B[nj];W[ri];B[rg];W[qc]
;B[pc];W[lg];B[kf];W[oi];B[kl];W[ip]C[klin: W J4 too deep. B should kill it.]
;B[ho];W[lm];B[km];W[lq];B[lp];W[mq];B[mp];W[kq];B[jq]C[M: was there a better way to handle the invasion? or was there really no choice?

klin: K3 not good.  Now should N2, then O2.];W[jr]C[klin: W R2 should O2 first.  It will be difficult for B to kill if W plays at O2.]
;B[ir]C[klin: This is bad. Should N2. If W M2, B M1 then O2.  In this case, if W cut at O4, B has 2 eyes.]
;W[iq];B[jp];W[hr];B[kr];W[is];B[mr];W[fr]C[klin: W escaped easily.  My conclusion is: if you cannot attack, don't play moves like L4.]
;B[do];W[co]C[M: was i just lucky, or did white really need to connect??

klin: Not necessary, but it worths a move.];B[io]C[klin: B gets gote here.]
;W[ih];B[ji];W[jh];B[df];W[hc];B[jc];W[de];B[ff];W[lc];B[md]
;W[pb];B[pd]C[M: Here, i thought it would be enough to just let white live, take sente, while looking at the invasion at f17... or was there a way to kill all white in the upper right?

klin: Wrong. Invading at F17 is not a big deal.  Of course it is possible to kill W.  You have so many stone around them.  If the cost is to let M17 escape, the let it be.]

(;B[db]C[M: would blocking/defending at c14 or c13 been a better choice?

klin: Yes. C14, or F12 better.
No comment beyond this point.];W[cb];B[eb];W[cf];B[dg];W[cg]

;B[hm];W[ik]C[M: mistake on my part: didn't see the cut... i guess i should've gone at J9 instead of h7??
