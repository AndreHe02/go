C[Hi, I would like to have your opinion about this game. I tried to write down about everything I was thinking and concidering during the game.]
;B[qd]C[I am playing white. As you can see my opponent is rated 7k, so it should be a relatively easy game for me.]
;W[dc]TR[qd]C[I usually reply black's move like this...];B[pq]
LB[cp:A][dp:B][dq:C]C[Normally I would play A or B here but I wanted to give C a chance. That is because I started to dislike both of them lately = see my 2 variations]

(;W[dq]C[So this game is actually my first experiment with this stone. And I was satisfied with the results.]
;B[oc]
(;W[rd]LB[qe:B][re:A][qj:2][qn:1]C[This is a bit too early maybe I guess. But I'm trying to force something here as well. I sometimes tend to think too much during the opening, then comming up with the wildest ideas. Maybe I'm trying to be too creative. Sometimes I lose a lot of thinking time this way.

So, my plan is: if black goes A, then I will play at 1, if he plays B, then I will play at 2.

eo:  S16 does seem to early.  as black, I'd try to take sente, perhaps by playing a bit move now and ignoring this move (the fear being that no matter how I answer this move now, white might ignore my response and take sente!)

Perhaps a good black sente now is D15 or D5 .];B[re]C[czark [7k\]: shouldnt be too hard to code into the clients :)]
;W[qn]C[
eo: as white, I might not play R6.

If black answers r6 with black r4 and white extends to r9, and black then plays r11, the r11 is a nice double purpose move, both attacking white and an ok distance from the upper corner.

Perhaps q5 or r5 better for white for this reason.];B[qp]C[I was a bit surprised here. But I probably would have done the same thing. The territory might be worth more, I guess ...]
;W[qk];B[np]C[eo: maybe black r11 is better than O4 as it is double purpose, extend from corner and attack white ?  (which relates to the fact that perhaps r5 was better for white than r6 ?)

You'd need to ask someone stronger than me  and then let me know.  (I'm only 2d in aga) .]
;W[qe];B[rc];W[pd];B[qc];W[rf];B[sd];W[pf]LB[og:A][pg:B]C[Normally, I would have played at A or B here. But since I have a strong group nearby, I don't have to play sabaki here I think.


eo:  white loses ground by playing q14.  

Because black is alive in corner, the value of saving the white stones is diminised.

bigger would be white d5 or c5 or d15 or c15or perhaps r13 to make more territory.  notice that with q14 instead of r13, black can still ruin the territory here with r13.

Also, a move at j3 looks bigger than q14.];B[pc]C[eo: white's lucky, cause black wasted a move with q17.  if white pushes there, black blocks at q18, and is not in danger because if white cuts on either side, black can keep his p17 stone connected (READING PROBLEM!)]
;W[cj]LB[np:B][iq:A]SQ[dc][dq]C[From the left side my 2 stones are placed on the 4th line. So that's the most important place on the board I guess. I was thinking about a move around A as well. Because of the high placement of B. But I think the left side was even more important.

So far everything seems to be perfect :).];B[ej]LB[dj:A]C[Well I should have expected this move. It looks pretty natural. Almost like a textbook situation.

I guess I could have avoided if I played the stone one line higher at A. But I'm a territory hungry player. That would be too risky for me :)]
;W[dl]C[Answering the cap with a keima. I think the bottum is the most important side, no ?]
;B[ci];W[bi]LB[ch:C][di:B][bj:A]C[I think black should play A here, B and C are mistakes according to some strong amateur player.

eo: to me b11 looks docile, but i could be wrong.  since white is stron enough in the area, how about white d10 instead, willing to cut if black answers at d11.

if black answers w d10 at c12, white has double purpose (corner and attack) answer at c15.]

(;B[ch]C[
eo: white letting black totally get into an area where white had dominance...]
;W[dj]LB[bh:2][ei:1]C[That's what the "joseki" says, right ? Next black should play at 1, and then I get to play 2...]

(;B[bh]C[
eo: as white i would answer this black move at c15, then if black blacks b10, I atari at b9 and take sente with something like j3 or j17.]
;W[di]C[Actually here I noticed that I might have given black what he wanted all along ?]

(;B[dh]LB[ce:B][bj:C][jq:A]C[Next I wanted to play somewhere around A.

I didn't want to bother playing B. Since I think Black is overconcentrated when he plays there. I believe B would make sense If I could hunt on the black group, but then again I think black would simply tenuki because he can always play C later on.]
;W[oq]LB[jq:A][lq:B]C[I played this move instead because I thought It could let me play B instead of A :)]
;B[op];W[lq];B[nq]C[
eo:  there's no reason for white to just give up p3 stone plus have to defend at j3.

How about just starting with j3 ??]
(;W[iq]LB[ip:A][kq:B]SQ[np][nq]C[I concidered A. But then black would reduce with B later on. thanks to his strong position.]
;B[do]LB[eo:C][fp:A][fq:B]C[The expected move. I was going to play A at first. But then I guessed black would play as in the first variation. That would destroy my precious territory.

Next I concidered B, so that I could start a nice cutting joseki. But I guess it's simply too low.

Next I was thinking about C.  But attaching to a weak stone ... after all he would probably simply live in the corner.]

(;W[cp]LB[co:4][ep:1][gp:3][eq:2]C[I saw this move in some chinese fuseki pro-games. I wanted to give it a try. If I'm not mistaken, next black should play 1, and after 4 moves, I can connect underneath to my stones at the left side.

eo:  how does white decide between c4 and c5 ?  When c5 "works" it's better than c4.]

(;B[co]C[Black seems to have a different plan. But I'm happy. with the territory at the bottum and the heavy shape of black.

eo: black looks heavy and attackable now here.  as black, I would consider f5 instead of c5.]
;W[fp];B[fn]LB[fo:A]C[I don't agree with black here neither. Why not attach with A. It would give him a better shape, and make me overconcentrated ? And a keima can be cut, right now it's still tricky but when my white group get's stronger it will be easier.

eo:  white making territory, black just running.  not good for black.]
;W[ei]C[I felt like this was the only move.];B[ce];W[cd];B[de]
;W[fd]LB[hc:3][od:1][pe:2]C[I regretted this move right after I played it. I expected the sequence of 1 to 3. See variation]

(;B[bj];W[bk]C[Imho a mistake by black again ?];B[ai];W[od]
LB[jc:A]C[A is obvious better here. Next black will play a double hane.

eo:  what strikes me about this white p6 is that now that black's group is settled in upper left, black can play something like f8 which both helps his heavy lower group and attack's white's middle stones.

for white, i would like to play something like g11 instead of p16, which both strengthens whites left side middle stones and attacks blacks lower ones.

[ I stop here for now, I have to go to work ! \]];B[nd]
(;W[mc]C[I wanted some kind of compensation ... in top-side territory.]

The game really looks easy here.];W[pj];B[pi];W[oi];B[oh];W[ph]
;B[og];W[rh];B[ri];W[qh];B[oe];W[pe];B[ni];W[oj]C[All together his influence looks a reasonable compensation maybe ?]
;B[kc]LB[ke:A]C[I was planning to play at A later on. For now I think it's not very urgent and my group at the left needs help first.]
;W[fl];B[hn];W[hl];B[eq];W[ep];B[dp]LB[cq:A]C[I was going to play at A first... but I noticed there were some complicated variations involved. :) And being so far ahead ;-) ... I think could relax, no ?

So instead I played something slightly different that looked easier to predict. "Simplify and finish of the game"]
;W[cr];B[bp];W[cq];B[bq];W[er];B[br];W[eo]C[AHA :) time for the cut :) The game will get even easier.]

By the way ... it was a bit hard to find the right direction here ? I guess grabing territory at the bottum is the correct way of thinking, since that would be sente for him.]
