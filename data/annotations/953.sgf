AB[pp][dd];W[pd];B[dp];W[fc];B[jd];W[cc]C[This simplifies the game, usually when W gives handi he goes for the counter-pincer against the wide pincer (K16), to create cpmlications.
but it's not bad, some strong players played like this against me and won :)]

(;B[fe]C[Black: Joseki moves are D14 and F16. What about this move?

E: what purpose did you have in mind ?
F16 immobilizes F17 more securely.
if you don't want to play tightly but on a larger scale, push at D14 or skip to E13, then maybe O17. But now those moves would make F15 very over-concentrated. so, it must be seen as a half-measure, neither here nor there.
I would recommend the large-scale approach in handi game. W may be able to pull his stone out; don't worry, see it as getting a target for attack, not losing territory. Good attacks that build useful positions give you the initiative. (beware of attacks that yield no usable advantage.)]
;W[df];B[ef];W[mc]
(;B[kc]C[White: Is L17 a mistake? (E12 better).

E: Oh yes, this is yose. E12 seeme to me over-doing it, K16 is only 5 spaces away, a little narrow. C9, K4, around Q10 - all bigger.]
;W[qj]C[good, creating a nice formation.
I wonder if B would rush in now ? that would be impatient - better to build up your own position.]
;B[eh]C[E: what purpose ? it does not build a moyo, and W's hane's at E13 etc. cause no damage.
around K4 or C9 (C9 - to leave room for 2-space extension - C12 - in case W invades on the left and gets strong somehow) better. The B position there is already very strong. play where your moves make a bigger difference - in open areas or where your move starts a chain of favourable exchanges, or prevents it from the opponent.]
;W[qn]C[The left area has become small for both sides,
because the E3 - C14 stones make it difficult for either side to take territory there. so, a move like F3, encouraging the opponent to move in the worthless direction, is perhaps more efficient.]
;B[np]
(;W[fq]C[White: Is F3 a mistake? (C6 better direction?)

E:  :) see previous comment.];B[jq]C[good, correct direction]
;W[fo];B[dn]C[in view of E13-C14, perhaps C6 is better, though putting a little pressure on the W stones.
I'm not sure though. anyway, once you do play on the fourth line like this, taking sente soon to play around C12 becomes important. The fourth line is the line of potential, and calls for continuance of play to develop this potential. the third line is the line of completion, and usually no urgent play in the same direction is called for.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[ip]C[Black: I think J4 was unnecessary.

E: yes, it encourages B to make an iron pillar
facing the one-space jump on the right. this exchange favors B and should rarely be made.
H3 is more patient, although a little cramped.
K5 is large-scale, probably initiating a fight.
W should also try to take sente to play on the left.];B[ch]
C[E: good point, but premature. W pushes where you should have, gets settled comfortably, even with some thickness. had you played K4, W sould still hace to follow up there, otherwise his J4 move becomes meaningless, so you still get to play C12. don't turn down invitaions like J4 :)]
;W[jp]C[Black: Thank for this move :-)];B[kq];W[dk];B[be]C[Black: B15 was a missread (gote).

E: yes. if W had less outside liberties, you could have gotten a ko if W tenukis after E19-F18 exchange.]
;W[ce];B[bf];W[bg];B[cg];W[bd];B[bh];W[ae];B[ag];W[ea]C[Black: B15 bad for this move.

E: true.];B[fa];W[da];B[fb];W[cl]C[Already game almost equal. I would still take B, but not by much.]
;B[ep];W[cr]C[Black: C2 is another white's mistake, I think.

Absolutely. letting B push through is bad. W just had to connect, let B defend at C2 or B6, and jump out to F9, and W has a good position, almost equal.]
;B[fp];W[gq];B[gp]C[next B attacks D9 stones, makes E13 look good, builds strength while W scrambles for life, and take initiative in the game.]
;W[hq];B[fk]C[E: I wonder if E8 is not more forceful. This is good enough though.]
;W[bn];B[co];W[bo];B[bp];W[fl];B[el];W[ek];B[dl];W[fj];B[gk]
;W[cj];B[gj];W[fi];B[gh]C[E:  H12 is usual here.

get C7 in at first chance.];W[gi];B[hi]C[E: E10 first can be useful.]
;W[hj]
(;B[fh]C[F12 is a mistake definitely.

E: oh yes... too bad.
you should play H8 , W can't escape through F12 (B G13, W F13, B E13, W G14, B H12 etc - W erases territory but can't escape).]
;W[fm];B[hk];W[dm];B[cm];W[en];B[bl];W[em];B[bm];W[cn];B[do]
;W[bk];B[ao];W[qd]C[E: W still is sealed in but the difference is - W got sente. W's mistake at F4 is cancelled off,
and game close again. I think B leads a little, not much relative to our (amateur players) level of accuracy.

instead of R16, how about O11 ? W has to be a little ambitious, and do something about the center.

By the way, B has seki in gote with B18.
W B2 is probably W's sente.];B[pi]C[good, working well with the central thickness.]
;W[qi];B[pg];W[qh];B[ni];W[me]C[good.];B[lf];W[di]C[Black: Another thank you move. After next J10 I was tight.

E: I hope you said thank you :)];B[ij]
(;W[ph]C[Black: White fell into my trap.];B[oh]C[E: hmm, quite generous. P13 better as W pushing through does not hurt B. big difference.]
;W[og];B[ng];W[of];B[nf];W[ne]
(;B[le]C[White: M15 big mistake. Absolutely unnecessary.

E: true. reverse-sente endgame, but small now.  R5 much bigger.]
;W[lb]C[Black: Small.

E: relatively , yes. How about M9 ?];B[om]C[White: The LR Corner is bigger.

E: actually I think this is good - K7 follow-up is very big, and if W enters the corner he ends in gote.]
;W[jm]C[Black: Then the corner is bigger still :-)

E: yes R5 now solidifies B's lead. next K18 is big too. But B looks like winning - W neglected the center, especially with the D11-J10 exchange.]
;B[kl];W[ok];B[qp]C[Black: I took the point finally.

E: good, better than R5 that I suggested.];W[mk];B[lj]C[E: Q8 first. if W Q9 B R8 W M10 B L11, B better than in the game.]

(;W[pm];B[ro];W[ia]C[E: K18 is usual.];B[ib];W[ja];B[ql];W[qm]
C[E: I think S7 works. This is last big loss I see.
B leads by about 15 pts now.];B[pl];W[ol];B[rl];W[on];B[nm]
C[good, to take sente.];W[nn];B[rm];W[mm];B[lo]C[smaller than it looks. K18 , J2, S6, B2 all bigger.]

;W[jo];B[jl];W[im];B[sj];W[rj];B[qb]C[E: W can ignore this.

B just has to play standard endgame, B still leads about 6 pts.]
;W[rc]C[W missed a chance here.];B[nq]C[E: N4 or even N5 better. why so defensive ?]
;W[il];B[jk]C[E: again, no need to give way. J9 fine.];W[ik]

(;B[kj]C[White: K10 better.

E: I don't see why.

anyway, W is closing the gap. next B2 biggest.];W[oj];B[oi]
