C[Hello reviewer! Thanks very much for your help. I was playing black and managed to win by a few points, but there were a few places where I felt totally lost. Also, I'm sure I could have done much better in the endgame.

--
Reviewed by Michaeljohn Clement.  I hope it is helpful to you.]
;B[pd];W[po];B[cd];W[do];B[jq]C[I've never seen white's opening like this before, but I thought this wedge was perfect - even if white approaches with F3 or G3 and black extends, the corner is far from definite territory.

--
This or K4 is seen, but a direct invasion at D3 or Q3 is much more common.  If w completes one of the two corners here, this move suddenly has little potential, so diving into the corner directly probably best.]
;W[jd];B[mc]C[I was hoping for wG17, bE17

--
E16 would be more likely for w, but this K16 stone can also be left alone for a bit.]
;W[qf];B[rd];W[qi];B[dj]C[I really wasn't sure about this move. Eventually I chose this because I didn't want to fight on the top. If white exchanges G17 for a corner enclosure then D10 is perfect, and if white approaches the corner then black can emphasise the left side.

--
Q3 might look good to me here, because if w plays there he gets a very nice formation on the right side.  UL corner is not so urgent, in my opinion.  On the upper left, I would prefer something around H16 first, preventing w from developing that stone in a comfortable way.  After this, w's next move looks natural and maybe too easy.]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[fd];B[ee];W[dc];B[cc];W[hq];B[mq];W[oq]C[

--
H3 is a little awkward-looking.  I would be tempted to play D3 here, preventing w from making a large corner territory.  P3 is not very threatening, as the R3 corner is still open, and the two b stones on the bottom are not that weak.]
;B[fq];W[dq]C[

--
D3 was more important than F3.]
(;B[go]C[

--
Here I would prefer G4 or F5, both more solid than this move.  This can be cut, so it is almost certain that there will be some future time in the game where you have to add a move here, as a result of playing this particular shape.]
;W[ho];B[hn]C[This fight turned out ok in the end, but I'm sure I handled it badly. This exchange seems daft in hindsight. I'd appreciate some advice on how I should have played to get the most out of it.

--
This is a strange situation, but if you don't play G4 you won't have to deal with this kind of strangeness...  Here you need to try to fix your shape.]

;W[lm];B[lo];W[km];B[mk];W[mm];B[gl]C[I only noticed now that the ladder works for black...

--
Yes.  The key to winning fights like this one is reading a little more than your opponent.  In this game, both players had opportunities to connect groups and end this local fight with advantage by playing ladders.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[fl];B[fk];W[el];B[dl];W[ck]C[

--
With time settings 5min. + 10/25 byo. there is plenty of time to not make mistakes like this.  I realize this is your opponent's mistake, but it is worth pointing out that If you have generous time settings, try to use a little more of the time and you will win more often and your rank will go up and skills will improve.]

--
B6 would also be sente.

However, none of this is as severe as it would be, because w can always connect with F4, etc.  You need to add a move at F2 for w groups to really be weak as they look.  The reason is because 50 moves ago you played G5 instead of something more solid.

Bad shape is always paid for later, this is an important principle.]
;W[eh];B[fg];W[bg];B[dg];W[ei];B[bf];W[gi];B[cr]C[

--
W is so thin after playing out a failed ladder, so you got some good attacking chances.  Here maybe you can get something, but it might be a little early to try this.  I am not sure if this is the best way to start...]

Yes, there are no big killing threats, but if you get two big moves on the rest of the board, you can get a good result for the ko.]

This is too thick, you already have an abundance of stones locally.  Something pushing into w's potential center territory from the other side would be better.]
