C[Zander: Hi, I played white.  In the end I lost, but for most of the game I thought it seemed pretty balanced.  I hope a review can point out ways to help me improve my game.  Thanks for your comments.

Zombie Abe: Hiya Zander, I'll mark my comments with an "A"]

(;W[cf]LB[hc:A][df:B]C[Zander: I don't know how this looks as an opening, but I thought it's reasonable, defensive, but maybe too small this early.

A: The way I see it, you have two areas for extension in this game - the top and right sides.  Because of Q3, the bottom isn't easily approached.  

So, a move at "A" would have targeted the top side.  Your move at C14 lets black develop there, but makes your stones strong enough to support an eventual invasion of the right side.  I'd say your move is an effective foundation for that attack.

Still - if those are the two areas of expansion, I would consider moving at "B" instead.  It has a stronger influence on both the top and right sides - it might be worth a sacrifice of strength on the left.]
;B[id];W[jj]LB[pi:A][po:B]C[A: This move does two things: it targets (and greatly weakens) black's center influence, and develops your own. But your capacity to make center territory is already pretty well diminished - black has reasonable routes of attack from above and below.

I think  it might have been better to dive deeper into black's territory at "A" or "B", since you really don't have much center influence to lose by it.]
;B[hj]LB[ph:B][jp:A]C[A: I think black has more to gain elsewhere - if white connects to K10, then black's center potential is greatly diminished - but black's strength is on the sides, anyway.]

(;W[nf]LB[ke:A]C[A: I don't like this move: I don't think the connection it makes with M14 is worth the strength you give black at O13.]

;W[nk];B[ll];W[on];B[pm];W[om];B[ij];W[np]C[Zander: I didn't try to save the stones at K10. I thought they might be dead in any case, and it could risk shutting off all the stones at O10 with no eye-space.

A: It's a good choice - there isn't a clean way to save those stones that i can see.]

;B[fp];W[fn]LB[ec:A][en:B]C[Zander: At this point I thought I was doing well, since I figured the territory I could hope to claim on the left could outweigh what was available for Black.

A:  I think A might have been a better move for keeping the territory on the left.  B has a weaker connection with M6 - but still threatens it, and is much more secure on your left.]
;B[do];W[co];B[eo];W[dn];B[en];W[em];B[cc]C[Zander: I thought I should have been able to stop this and keep the corner, but alas I did not.]

(;W[db]LB[cd:A]C[A: I don't think this move was worth it! Consider A.]
;B[be]LB[bf:A]C[A: Still, your territory is below black - it's worthwhile making the wall at A.]

(;W[ce];B[bf];W[bg];B[bd];W[ab]LB[gd:B][cg:A]C[Zander: I guess I didn't think this through, because it doesn't accomplish much at this point.

A: Right.  A would have been more standard - and B works as well.]

(;W[ok];B[qf];W[ra]LB[gg:A][eh:B]TR[rh]C[Zander: Before this, I thought Black could kill all those stones with a play at Q19.

A: You were safe - if black tried Q19, you could play at A, then B.

C[Zander: Not terrible, but a bit disappointing.  In retrospect I think I could have saved 5 or 6 points in the end-game, but my real problem was a failure to contain the invasions in the upper left.  Thanks again for any advice.

A: A good game.  Keep reminding yourself where your territory is, and try to keep your moves consistent with that!]
