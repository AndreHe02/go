C[xxc : i do the review of this game from B side with a general strategy comment

first it may be interesting to remember guideline accroding general strategy

1 corner, side, center (this may be ok for u)
2 and what ???
difficult answer, but this can help :
- status of each groups (B and W)
- purpose of last move

with such simple questions one's may be able to answer and find when a move should be answered or not

in case of a not ... next can be, where is the necessary/big next one then ?]
;B[pp];W[pd]C[Salient [20k?\]: hello];B[dp]C[Deg [?\]: hello]
;W[dd];B[jd]TR[cf][qf][jp]C[xxc : why not, but it can induce troubles latter
each mark is a common

staying in line with simple moves may be better when you'r in search of improvment]
;W[qh];B[pk]TR[fc][nc][jd]C[xxc : better to strenghten the lone one here]
;W[cj];B[cl]C[xxc : here again];W[dg];B[gd];W[md]LB[fc:1][kc:2]
[gf:A][jf:B]TR[jp][jq]C[xxc : what about starting to think the way i introduce this comment ?

status of each groups here ?
all seems ok no ? B and W
the weaker may be the upper one B, but ... can find a way out (center A,B) and a base (1, 2)

by the way with such high stones (4th line) center may be the best target

then, a move elsewhere seems a good idea

a threat ? W left and right looks ok and difficult to attack now (this may result in a stronger group dangerous for the B one

then take a big one : marked lower];B[kb];W[jq]C[I'm not sure how to respond to K3, although in hindsight it looks like an attack from the sides might have been more effective.

xxc : i think so];B[jp]C[xxc : may be difficult from here for B

W can find an easy way to live here, too much space];W[iq];B[ip]
;W[hq]TR[fq][mq]C[xxc : i think it may be better to forget these stones for now and wait, maybe they can help later

all i can read are difficult path here, it wont help];B[gq]
TR[fq]C[xxc : same result but stronger one space back];W[gr]
;B[fr];W[gs];B[fs];W[hr];B[gp];W[hp];B[ho];W[kp];B[ko];W[lp]
;B[mo]LB[nq:A][lr:B]C[xxc : A threatening B

help B corner ( and side) while destroying the W base];W[mp]
;B[np];W[nq];B[op]C[I'm not sure how to contain white. He cuts upward with two double ataris that I didn't see coming.]
;W[lo]LB[mn:4][go:2][no:1][fq:3]TR[ko][ip][jp]C[xxc : here again a look at whole board is usefull

first answer : are marked B stones important ?
if yes, then a save is necessary, if not, play eslsewhere

answer ?
i may say no

next : group status
all seems ok

next : time to strike or to protect something (meaning spend a stone now to prevnet problems latter and then win one or more stones latter)
this time the answer seems to be here ... where to protect ?

i think 1 seems good
this help the B group and it will be usefull later to fight upper right side later

a move at 4 go for the center, the first idea wiht the 2 dead stones JK4]
;B[ln];W[jo];B[io];W[kn];B[jn];W[ko]LB[lm:2][mn:1]TR[pk][cl]
[dp][pp]SQ[gk][nk][gl][jl][kl][nl][gm][nm][gn][nn][go][no][gp]
[np][gq][nq][gr][nr]C[xxc : nearly the same comment as previous one
protect seems the key here and still the same side 1 or 2

beside that it can be possible to introduce an other interesting  idea
B starts with taged stones, and now, these seems useless don't you think so ?

from 2 strong positions facing south side, B got nothing here but a strong W group with quite a lot of points and some weak points in his own shape
shoud be beter to have a lighter W group inside and B stones arround the square no ?]
;B[jm];W[mn];B[lm];W[no];B[nm];W[mm];B[km];W[ml];B[on];W[oo]
;B[po];W[nn];B[pm]SQ[om]C[xxc : connect ?];W[nl];B[ol]TR[mb]
[qj][or]SQ[in][go][fq]C[xxc : a ko ?

here again it would be time to look at the whole board

all groups ?
no changes from previous status

weak points still here at left, but it seems safer now

it may be time to strenghten upper B group ?
perhaps some early yose too ?];W[om];B[oq]TR[pn]C[xxc : just connect]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[on];B[rm];W[ok];B[pl];W[oj];B[qi];W[pi];B[pj]

;W[sh];B[rj];W[kk];B[ll]TR[mb][cc][qc][bk][mq][nr]C[xxc : again, look at the whole board

from now (a little earlier perhaps, but previous moves are in the good way) it's also time to think about points

all groups should be really ok at this point of the game (100 moves)
but there is still space all arround

then it is necessary to take time to get a rough idea of this, where are points and how much ?
can i expand mine, can i reduce ?

and are there still spots for invasion ?

of course oi can't show all of those, but some ideas];W[lk]
;B[jk]TR[kh];W[jj];B[ij];W[ji];B[ii];W[jh];B[jg];W[kg];B[jf]
C[xxc : forgot it];W[ih];B[hh]C[xxc : doesn't protect the cut

and why connect 2 living groups ?];W[jl];B[ik];W[kl];B[il];W[mb]
;B[la]TR[cc][bk][nr]C[xxc : this is really late yose];W[ma]

[es][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[xxc : ok, always difficult to introduce general ideas about go
i think the best is to find a stronger friend to comment games after games, i have done it with good results

here i have pointed out the way to think and when take a break to get away from the local war and think about the whole game
this is really difficult, one's need to find the good spot to do that

the key is not an obvious way, there is always a good reason to stay in a fight " i was afraid of ..."

i hope i let enought material here to help
you have break points
small moves
big spots
and a starting process to follow

thank u])
