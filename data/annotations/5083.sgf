C[[In all a great game played by both sides. Main suggestion is to always look in areas other than the last played for opportunities, rather than playing automatic responses. Also choose to play a move that may take 1 less point, requires a response from your opponent that does not require further defense allowing you to play first in yet another area. Watch the walls that are/would-be built as a result of battles and the territory that is made when combined with other nearby stones. It is possible to lose every battle and win the war if you always get to pick where the battles occurr. Try reviewing another game yourself and see if the same comments have an impact. Enjoy.\]

;W[dc];B[ed];W[jd]C[[Yes K16 is a good move for either side.\]
Here I panicked because I planned to go there, which obviously the opponent saw...]
;B[db]C[[Playing D18 instead of E18 is worth very little more compared to not having to play a supporting move like F18 which gives up the initiative to play in a new area (sente) that is worth more.\]]

(;W[cf];B[hc]C[[It would have been better to play H17 immediately in respnse to K16 in the first place.\]
I realize that this is probably not a very good move. I become over concentrated in that area.]
