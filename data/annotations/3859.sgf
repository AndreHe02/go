AB[pd][dp][pp];W[de];B[ic];W[qf];B[dc];W[fc]LB[nc:a]C[ This is the first move I do not agree.

Strategically, in a h3 game, there is no need to
fight at a place that favors the opponent, especially at the very begining of the game. It is better that fighting starts from somewhere you have more stones than your opponent. So I suggest you play W[a\]. You surely can chose to approach other two corners.]
;B[ed]C[This is a local fight that favors Black.];W[hd]LB[hc:a]
[gd:b][ce:c][cf:d][cd:e]C[I suggest Black proceed from B[a\] to B[e\] sequentially. This way, Black settled down in the corner and White has two unsettled groups.]
;B[fd];W[hc];B[id];W[ie]LB[he:a]C[W[a\] is reasonable.];B[he]
;W[ge];B[hf];W[gd];B[je]C[So far, Black captured the stone, Black obviously  gained a lot here. And still, Whilte does not have very effective way to attack the corner.]
;W[qn];B[if];W[ff];B[ce];W[np];B[nq]LB[pn:a]C[B[a\] seems simpler and usual.]
;W[cf];B[ef];W[df];B[ee];W[eg];B[bd]LB[cd:a]C[This is a bad move and should play at B[a\] to settle the corner.]
;W[fg]LB[cc:a][cb:b][bc:c]C[This is slow move, W should play W[a\] to attack the corner. Since the corner is very weak, W need not to worry about the cut at [F13\], Please verify that.]
;B[fb];W[gb]LB[cc:a]C[Another slow move, this is the last chance to attack Black corner at W[a\].]
;B[eb]C[Now, the chance is gone.];W[cd]LB[be:a][cc:b][cb:c]
[dd:d][bc:e]C[It is now too late.

Black should next play B[a\] to B[e\]. It is better than the way actually played.]
;B[bc]C[This is not the best, see my previous comment];W[be]
;B[cc]LB[op:a]C[This move is not needed at all. Black corner is already alive, and Black should go elsewhere, for example B[a\].]
;W[oq]LB[mq:a]C[bsaltman [5k\]: it was w's corner so w has the right to come out ahead here


You are right, but still it does not hurt that you come out ahead here :)


This White move is like playing a h5-h6 game.
locally, W[a\] is good enough. I feel that White is a bit too agresive than he should be in a h3 game.
My experience is that you can play a h3 game as if it was an even game and initiate attacking only when you see your oppoent's bad moves. This will happen given the rating difference. If this doe not happen, it only means that you cannot h3 him.]
;B[op]C[ericosman [2k\]: white started on 5-4 and white originally ignored J17 response, so I'm not sure I agree it was white's corner]
;W[pq]C[bsaltman [5k\]: also w has to make a gote thinckness move sometime to make the previous moves valuable]
;B[qq]C[ericosman [2k\]: white already made gote move at F13 when you didn't cut]
;W[qr]C[bsaltman [5k\]: has to make another one too to make thickness useful]
;B[qp]C[ericosman [2k\]: thickness already made useful by forcing black to play the gote in that corner !]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[mr]LB[lq:a]C[Next Black should paly B[a\]];B[pn]
;W[qm];B[rr]LB[lq:a]C[B[a\] is important.];W[pr]LB[lq:a][mp:b]
[no:c]C[This is too slow, should play W[a\] to W[c\], B can capture the stone at R2, but that is gota.]
;B[lq]C[Now, the situation for W is totally bad. B];W[no]C[bsaltman [5k\]: ah--quibble quibble''']
;B[on]C[ericosman [2k\]: wow.  thought you'd turn at M2 instead of P6
ericosman [2k\]: or P1 might be even better than turn
bsaltman [5k\]: m 2 still there
ericosman [2k\]: last time you said "still there" was the F13 cut that you lost opportunity for
bsaltman [5k\]: opportunity I didnt want to take
ericosman [2k\]: i know but the "still there" argument doesn't always hold]
;W[rs]LB[qs:a][ps:b][sq:c][lr:d][kq:e][kr:f][jq:g]C[bsaltman [5k\]: nothing always holds ewxcept grqavity


This is a dangerous move, Starting from B[a\] to B[g\] is almost the necessary move sequence, White is forced to crawl at the second line, very painful.]
;B[mn]C[Not the best move but still OK,  and White lost this local battle.]
;W[rq];B[rp];W[sr];B[qj]C[Good attacking. Now the situation is getting close to hopeless for White.]
;W[pk];B[qh]LB[qk:a][pl:b]C[B should B[a\] W[b\] first to deprive the eye shape of W.]
;W[nc]C[bsaltman [5k\]: even gravity has its off-days];B[oe]
LB[qk:a][pl:b][oj:c]C[ericosman [2k\]: shall i assume that your breaking into joke-mode is a way of acknowledging that my strategical assessment has some merit ?


What about B[a\] to B[c\] attacking and table the corner for a while. Later B could play [R17\].]
;W[qc]C[bsaltman [5k\]: you can if you wish---but it doesn't add any validity to your arguments]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pg];W[qk]C[Black is slow around here and W is catching up.]

;W[nj];B[dl]LB[qb:a]C[B[a\] might be sento];W[cj];B[jm]C[This is very slow and loose move, no threatening to W.]
;W[iq];B[rk]LB[rl:a]C[This move is helping W to make eyes. should play B[a\] locally.]
;W[rl]C[ericosman [2k\]: please explain S9
bsaltman [5k\]: mo];B[gq]C[ericosman [2k\]: you typed "mo" .  I wasn't threatening to get any "mo" eyes even if you hadn't played S9.  I only had one there.   But now I threaten to make one "mo" by playing Q7, so maybe G3 without S9 would have been good ?
bsaltman [5k\]: moby];W[lr];B[co]LB[hq:a][gp:b][lp:c][kq:d]
[kp:e]C[What about next W[a\] to W[e\] to kill the three Black stones?]
;W[kq];B[mo];W[kp];B[lo];W[bl];B[pb]C[ericosman [2k\]: that's a powerful move

ericosman [2k\]: probably

;W[ra];B[pa];W[sb]C[bsaltman [5k\]: where are the bifg points? where should b play? bifg or urgent?]
;B[ll]C[This is again slow. Black played a lot of slow moves recently, even though the situation for B is not bad rihgt now.]
;W[kc]C[This is overacting.];B[jb];W[kf];B[ke];W[lf];B[le];W[mf]
LB[kh:a][jg:b][ii:c][pl:d]C[What about this: From B[a\] to B[c\] kill all the whilte stones and later B[d\] to kill the other group also :)]
;B[me];W[nf]LB[kh:a][jg:b][ii:c]C[This is suicide move. Next B[a\] , White all dead.]
;B[jh]LB[kh:a]C[bsaltman [5k\]: seems like izarre idea on w part here

ericosman [2k\]: thinking of reducing that top area
ericosman [2k\]: but i have over extended myself
bsaltman [5k\]: pipe dream'
ericosman [2k\]: (I admit without dropping into joke mode)
bsaltman [5k\]: just slightly :-)

C[Now, B failed and W gained a lot here.];B[kk]C[ericosman [2k\]: now the reduction has succeeded


Yes, but it is all becuase of Black's wrong moves.];W[ib]
(;B[ha]C[bsaltman [5k\]: undo

(;B[ia]LB[kb:a]C[ericosman [2k\]: when you thought about the atari, did you consider the ko ?
bsaltman [5k\]: sort of
ericosman [2k\]: "sort of " ???  what does that mean
bsaltman [5k\]: not deep



No need to ask for trouble here. simply B[a\] should be fine.]
;W[ha]C[bsaltman [5k\]: shallow dim awareness];B[kb]C[ericosman [2k\]: i only sort of know what you're trying to say.  either you considered it or not.]

;B[en];W[cl];B[ik];W[ko];B[gh]C[Big move, now Black win for sure, no comments afterwards.

In summary, I feel that W can not win the game after the fight at the lower-left corner.
Even though B played many slow moves afterwards and White catched up a lot, There is still almost no chance.

The reason why White lost the game so quickly seems to me is because of the too agressive style, treating a h3 game like a h6 game. I suggest to play h3 game more peacefully and White should be able to get more wining chances.]
