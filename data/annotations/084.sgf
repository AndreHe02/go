DT[1994-11-19]TM[600]KM[0.5]HA[4];W[qf];B[qe]L[nd]C[ Usually it's a bad  idea to play kosumi tsuke when white can extend along the edge. The  normal move is at A. The reason is that you loose the option to attack  white because you make him strong.]
;W[pf];B[nc];W[pk]L[qj][pj]C[ This extension is too wide.  White can be satisfied with the normal moves here: either A or B.]
;B[qn]L[dj][pi]C[ Maybe just making san-rensei (with A) is bigger. But anyway
 this move emphasises the thinness of white's position on the right.
 A move at B is an option now.];W[gp]C[This move is ok considering this is a handicap game.]
;B[fq]C[Bad, black won't gain a lot while white will get stronger.];W[cf]
L[fp][gq]C[White should play either A or B, these moves are too big to
 let go by. Black could take quite a lot of profit now by playing either  of these moves.]
;B[ch];W[fd]C[ Because the marked stone  is in a low position settling along the upper edge is not really valuable  here. Besides, white has a number of weak groups already, so simply  entering san-san (3,3) point is better here.]
;B[df];W[dg];B[ef]L[cg]C[ Black's only move here is cut at A, no matter what happens next.]
;W[cg]C[This fight has turned out to be a success for white.];B[dh]M[ch]
C[Bad again, it's better to forget about the marked stone for a while since it's too weak to move right now.]
;W[eg];B[ff];W[eh];B[cj];W[ej]L[id][jc][cn]C[This move is a bit simple for black. It will be obvious what will be his response, and you won't get much stronger by it. Maybe trying to settle along the upper edge with either A or B is more interesting. You can aim at C later on.]
;B[cl];W[bd]C[You just strengthened this group in the center so it is not in need for eye space. Aiming san-san is more interesting. But again, settling the upper edge is urgent.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[bb];W[hd]C[Good :)];B[jc];W[jd]L[ie][kd][gg]C[The problem of this move is that it gives away territory. So you have to be sure that your attack on the upper left will be serious as well. A cheap alternative is the move at A. This also aims the attack and besides prepares for either follow up move B or C.]
;B[ic];W[hc];B[id];W[hf];B[ge]C[Not good.];W[he];B[gd];W[db];B[cb];W[gc]
;B[fc];W[kd]L[ie]C[This move is overplay. There is no way to fight when black plays A.]
;B[ie];W[if];B[je];W[me];B[jf];W[ih];B[jg];W[hi];B[fb]M[jd][kd]C[The two marked stones don't have much meaning now.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[iq]L[gq]C[This move invites white to play A so it's not good. Better is to play A himself.]
;W[gq];B[lo];W[gn];B[ql]C[Same comment as F3.];W[qk];B[nf]C[Good point, separating the white stones here.]
;W[oe];B[ne];W[od];B[nd]L[oc]C[Black at A is only move here.];W[oc]M[pd][qe][me][kd][jd]C[WHite is very successful here. The trade of the marked stones is good for white.]
;B[pc];W[ob];B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[rc]L[qb][qg]C[Just jumping in at A is a simpler way to kill here especially considering the cut at B. You have to be sure to kill, otherwise this move will become mochi-komi (a loss).]
;B[qb];W[rb];B[ra];W[pe];B[rd];W[qc];B[pb];W[cn]C[A good point for attack.]
;B[dn];W[do]C[Good follow-up.];B[eo];W[dm]C[Connect is the only move, whatever happens.]
;B[co];W[cm];B[bm]L[ek]C[Probably better at A.];W[bn]C[Only move, good.]
;B[bl];W[bo]C[This move is not interesting. Locally, san-san is the point to start something.]
;B[bp]C[Better to play san-san.];W[en];B[do];W[dk];B[bg];W[bi];B[bh];W[bj]
;B[ck];W[di];B[ci];W[bf];B[dj]L[ag]C[Better to play at A. This will make the group at least ko.]
;W[ek];B[ag];W[ai];B[ei];W[fi];B[fh]L[ak]C[Black A makes the group alive, no need to play these moves.]
;W[fg];B[gh];W[gg];B[gi];W[fj];B[gj];W[hh];B[gk];W[fn];B[am];W[ap]L[bq]
C[You loose the move at A with this exchange.];B[bq];W[ak];B[ao];W[an];B
[ik];W[ji];B[kk];W[fp];B[fr];W[gr];B[ep]L[dr]C[Very bad shape, inviting white to play at A. Black should play A himself.]
;W[dr];B[dq];W[er];B[eq];W[cr];B[fs];W[br];B[aq]C[This move is better at A.]
;W[ar];B[es];W[cq];B[cp];W[em]L[dl][bk]C[Wrong. If you play this move at A, you can play B next, killing the left side group.]
;B[ds];W[gs];B[cs];W[fo]C[Huge ko.];B[in];W[bs];B[nm];W[fe]L[pq]C[More urgent seems the lower side group. Settling it with A is normal.]
;B[ed];W[gf];B[qh]C[Good spirit.];W[ph];B[rh];W[qi];B[qg];W[pg];B[ri];W

C[The tsuke at A is better, especuially since black is open on the right side.]
