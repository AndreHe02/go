C[atadano [4k\]: hello

DRS: I've added a few questions to the record, but comments on anything you feel looks important are most welcome.]

;B[cd];W[qp];B[co];W[cl]C[This pincer is usually played when the position in the upper left is white and you can make territory. If the pincer you play is more like an invasion, you usually play a high pincer so it is easier to get into the center. That's my feeling, but I don't think it is a hard rule...]
;B[fo];W[gq];B[ci]C[This move feels very good for black to play, so that's why I wouldn't play C8 in the first place...]
;W[fl]C[DRS: From looking in a joseki dictionary, I see this is a mistake.  I don't know why though.

It doesn't threaten to cut the two black stones below, so it lacks force - it's not really a bad move in this position, though...]
;B[cq];W[cr];B[dp];W[eq];B[fp]LB[bq:A][fq:B]C[A or B next is joseki]
;W[qf]C[DRS: From a joseki dictionary, I see F3 was expected.  I thought this would protect against the ladder that results if B pushes and cuts.  Is this incorrect?

R14 is indeed a ladder breaker, but leaving behind so much bad aji is not correct. I put in two variations as an example of how black can exploit this aji...]
