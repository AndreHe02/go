C[Hi Will

My comments are preceded by my initials, "NR". Feel free to email me if you have any further questions.

Overall, I think the answer to your question on how to deal with big moyos may be to "not allow them" in the first place. You may need to experiment a bit with pincers and corner invasions - more in the review comments.

Regards
Nicholas

LB[qc:A]
(;W[pg];B[of]LB[qe:A]C[NR: The usual response is at A - see continuation.]

(;W[og];B[ng];W[oi];B[nh];W[pi];B[cn]LB[cl:A]C[NR: Since this direction is valuable for black, and he can get nice extensions and form a moyo, you can consider a pincer here.]

(;W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck]LB[cc:B][qc:C][qe:D][jp:A]C[NR: It seems to me that any of the marked points would be a good choice (i.e. big points). I personally prefer A or B.]
;W[cf]C[NR: My feeling is that this approach move helps black to get stronger, while white creates a weak group.]
;B[df]
(;W[dg];B[ef];W[ci];B[fg];W[ei];B[np]LB[lp:A]C[NR: Again, you may want to try the option of a pincer.]

(;W[pn];B[oq];W[pq];B[kq]LB[iq:A]C[NR: A move at A would strengthen your 3 stones in bottom left, and also put some pressure on black stones.]

(;W[nm]
(;B[gi]LB[cc:A][jc:B][qc:C][ce:D]TR[cf][dg][ci][ei]C[NR: If  you worry about the moyo, you can probably try one of the marked points of invasion (A-C). However, you may first need to strengthen the marked stones first. Maybe with a move at C15 (D).

The move in the actual game seems too deep. See my later comment.]
;W[jh]LB[jj:A]C[NR: I feel that this move is too deep into black's formation. Perhaps black could seal you in or attack somehow? I am not sure.]

(;B[ce]LB[bf:A]C[NR: A has a better followup (and creates more space for white).]

(;W[cg];B[ni];W[jj];B[nk]LB[ei:A][nm:C][fq:B]C[NR: Here you might also try to defend on the right and treat the centre stones "lightly"? You can connect them to one of the directions marked (A-C) instead of trying to make the stones live.]
;W[mj];B[mk];W[li];B[nj];W[lk];B[mm];W[ll];B[lm]LB[km:A]C[NR: See alternative with A. Seems like a better shape.]

(;W[jl];B[ik];W[jk];B[mi];W[kj];B[kh];W[ij];B[hk]LB[km:A]TR[gi]
C[NR:perhaps a move in this direction would be better. Pushing through the marked stones may not be optimal (you can help connect black and have no gain for white. See alternative path with option for black.]

;B[pj];W[qj];B[om]LB[ol:B][on:A][iq:C]C[NR: There are bigger points than A or B at this point. e.g. the invasion of the top corners, or the move at C.
In any case, if you want to respond to black move, consider the continuation carefully.]

(;W[on];B[nn];W[nl];B[ol];W[pm];B[ml];W[qc];B[pc]LB[qd:B][re:A]
C[NR: The move at A cannot be reasonable. Why not B?]
(;W[re];B[jg];W[ig]C[NR: This move is what they call "wishful thinking". It is evident that the stone can be cut. Pause before playing a move and think of some alternatives.]
;B[ih];W[ji];B[hh];W[cc];B[dc];W[be];B[cd];W[bd];B[cb];W[bc]
;B[hq]LB[bq:A]C[NR: Big move. Usually white would like to help out the stones a bit with a move at A. If you see later in the game these stones had a problem.]

;W[pe];B[oe];W[od];B[pb];W[oc];B[ob];W[md]LB[mc:A]C[NR: Think how you would respond to a move at A. 

Basically my review ends here, as I don't have any other useful comments to make.

From here on black helped you win, by making a series of mistakes. You fought well and took advantage of black lack of calmness to deal with the attacks :)]
