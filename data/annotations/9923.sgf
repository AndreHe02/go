C[Hello,
I won this game, but my opponent made several weak groups and I failed to attack them correctly. The win is only thanks to the reverse komi. It would be extremly helpful for me, if you could show me how I should've handled his and my groups.

Hi!

I am a European 2d player, calling myself HonFu in the GTL.

One general thing first, which you likely know already, but must of us tend to doubt at least sometimes, so it bears repeating: The meaning of an attack is NOT to kill a group (because usually it is almost impossible to do that), but to get some kind of profit by attacking. The idea is that while your opponent has to defend his weak group, he is not achieving anything (except not dying), while you get to build up power or territory. 

Normally it doesn't have to be a very big profit either! The nature of go is a close game, because when both players make no mistakes, it will always be a very close result. Let's say, starting from a close position, you go on an attack and gain 5 points for free and become thick everywhere. That's already nice, isn't it? Winning by a small margin but safely is better than trying to win big, but risk losing control of the game flow. Keeping in control of the game flow while trying to get just a bit ahead - I think that's what you should try to do with your attacks!

So let's take a look!];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[od];B[cp];W[ep];B[gq]
;W[fo];B[dq];W[eq];B[cn];W[kp]
(;B[go];W[gn];B[ho];W[fn]LB[mq:A][nq:B]TR[go][ho][gq]C[should black have attacked here already at A?

*Hon* I think so. If you play A, then both White's groups will remain weakish, which makes the fighting easier for you. 

If White gets to play B, he will not only strengthen himself, he will also weaken your corner stone and your marked group.]
;B[hn];W[cm]LB[dm:A]C[This move seemed strange to me already. Shouldn't white worry about his middle group? I tried to seperate white,  but it worked out for him well...

*Hon* This move looks like a bit too much. A seems more natural ... but well, White wants to surround you forcefully, so you have to find a way to refute that ...]

(;B[dn];W[dm];B[em];W[dk]
(;B[gl]LB[el:A]C[*Hon* This move may look "shapy" to you, but White can aim at thin spots. A instead is simpler, since it leaves White no choice.]
;W[fl];B[el];W[fm]
(;B[en];W[ek]C[*Hon* It is annoying that White is able to block here.]

(;B[mq];W[bm];B[bn]C[*Hon* It's annoying if you have to answer here. Maybe you could have tenukied and still live; but I will not go into that because it depends on your reading, and in this we are on our own in every single game. (That's why we have to build up our muscles with tsumego and serious games.)]
;W[gk]C[*Hon* White is strong now.];B[fc]LB[kn:A]TR[hn][go]
[ho][kp][gq]C[maybe black should've capped the white stone at A? But I thought it still wouldn't be dead and I'd need another move, which would give white sente too often?

*Hon* Okay, this is important, so let's take some time for this.

In the opening and middle game, you foremost have to think about strength and weakness issues. Of course points and sente etc. are important ... but safety always comes first! 

It is often recommended that with every move we ask ourselves three questions:

1.) Am I in trouble somewhere?
2.) Is my opponent in trouble somewhere?
3.) What is the biggest point?

Now we treat this list as an order of priorities. When we indeed are in trouble somewhere, then this problem has to be solved first - now, not later (1) - even if we lose sente or miss a big point somewhere else. If we are not in trouble, we can look for the enemy's weaknesses and start to attack him (2) in a way that helps us. If there are no weak groups, neither our own nor our enemy's, then we can go for the biggest point (3). 

The ideal - obviously - would be a move that achieves all three aims at the same time, if possible. But you must not get seduced into violating the priority order, for example attacking (2), while being not safe yourself yet (1). 

(Sometimes you also have to make considerations like: "Is my group so big or can I sacrifice it?" Or: "Okay, I am weak here, but my opponent is weak over there, too, and his group, if it died, would die bigger than mine ..." Then it starts to become quite difficult, but the principle is still the same: If you are in trouble, you have to care about that, before you go for an attack or for points.)

Yes, if you play A, you will probably not kill the marked stone, but this is really not the point. First you have to look at your own weaknesses, and if you do this, you will spot your marked group at the bottom. As soon as White gets out into the center with his marked stone, your group will become weaker. If you play A, you strengthen these stones (1), but you will also attack the white marked stone (2), which should bring some profit for you, like getting strong in the center and getting solidified in the lower right, and furthermore, since White will remain weakish for a while, you might get more profit along the right side (3). So in this case you might very well kill three birds with one stone!

Again: A is a key point, because it 1.) strengthens yourself AND 2.) weakens the enemy.

Your move in the upper left only cares about 3: value. It is certainly big to reduce White's influence zone at the top, but neither does this strengthen your weak group, nor does it attack a weak group of the opponent (the corner stone will be alright even if you get a double pincer).]
;W[kn];B[im]C[*Hon* This move is passive, but well, you want to get away ... That's why it was so important not to let White do this in the first place.]
;W[kl];B[ik]
(;W[ii]LB[hj:A][jj:B]C[*Hon* I doubt White's decision to change direction here. 

White is still not strong at the bottom, yet he goes on an attack, and with a cap that has no real connection to his other groups (there are holes at A and B).]
;B[jj];W[dr];B[cr];W[er]C[*Hon* This is a strange moment to take gote. 

Maybe White thought, he can kill the corner, if you tenuki? If that's not possible, then this is a serious mistake (playing an endgame in the middle of a fight).]
;B[lj]C[*Hon* Now you still get to attack the enemy from above. Good! Your weakish stones become stronger, his weakish stones become weaker.]
;W[ml]
(;B[pl]C[*Hon* This looks as if you get profit on the fourth line ...]
;W[nk]C[*Hon* ... but on the other hand, you are driving your opponent to the outside and your other group, so that after some fighting it might become weaker again.]
;B[pj]C[*Hon* And now you just help him splitting you.];W[ni]
LB[qn:A][qq:B]C[*Hon* Voil√†. 

Like this you do not accomplish too much, because White can first get stronger by turning the tables on your bottom group, then aim at invading the right side.]
;B[kh];W[pn]LB[ph:A]TR[od]C[This move seems similar to C 7. This time I tried to do some kind of leaning attack.

*Hon* I find it hard to lean effectively right now, since you are also not completely safe yourself. When White gets to surround you at A, it will be again him controlling the flow.

Well, is this an overplay or not ... it is certainly an enterprising move ... but you are not completely safe in the center, the right side might be surrounded, the marked stone might assist in a fight ... White has some things to work with, and that's basically because you haven't taken control (getting strong yourself, making him weak) earlier.]
;B[lo];W[qp]C[*Hon* Tenuki ... expensive, but well, he gets to continue in the corner, which is nice.]
;B[qq];W[pq]
(;B[op];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[qo]
(;B[ko]C[*Hon* Of course it's nice to cut here. 

You not only take points (3), but your center group will definitely be alright now and you don't have to look back in worry (1).]

(;W[nn]C[*Hon* White connects to the corner and also is quite safe now.]
;B[ph];W[qf]C[*Hon* Again an enterprising move ... but since White has safely connected to the corner, he can risk an invasion.]
;B[pe];W[jo];B[jn];W[jm];B[in];W[ln];B[mo];W[no];B[mp];W[qi]
;B[pi];W[rj];B[pf];W[re]C[*Hon* White's invasion is a bit annoying, since it is not sure if you can actually use the resulting strength (White is already strong in the center.]

(;B[rk];W[rd]C[This was frustrating white just lived and I couldn't do anything, and I don't see any profit black made...

*Hon* Earlier you drove White out to the center, weakening yourself. As a result of the struggle after Q6, he got alive in the corner and connected to the center, so there was no real risk invading your right side. That's why you have to look for a way getting strong yourself and keeping the opponent weak.]
;B[qc];W[rh]
(;B[jd]C[trying to take an extension from my wall, but white....

*Hon* I'd pincer one point closer, making it harder to live.]
;W[ld]
(;B[fe]C[*Hon* This is slack.];W[df]C[*Hon* Like this, White can argue that he was right not to answer in the corner in the first place, because later you gave him his defence move anyway.]
;B[ng]C[wanted to make sure black is safe and also attack white.]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[kc];B[id];W[lg]
(;B[le];W[me];B[mf]TR[lg]C[trying to keep white cut. Maybe that was wrong?

*Hon* Cutting weak stones is usually useful, but if White just lives and what you cut off is not all that big (the marked stone sits in a tight area), you might end up regretting it.]
;W[ke];B[lf];W[kd];B[kf];W[je];B[ig]C[*Hon* Here again you separate White, but this cut alone does not bring you any profit. So again you might consider instead, if you can take the points in the upper right, while threatening White, letting him take the neutral spot instead of you.]
;W[ie];B[he];W[hf];B[gd];W[if];B[ef]LB[ob:A]TR[id][jd][kd][he]
[je][ke][le][hf][if][kf][lf][ig]C[trying to lean again, but this time it didn't work out so well. He got to keep his points and also safe his group... Where did I go wrong?

*Hon* On the outset you were not thinking enough about how exactly you want to profit from all this.

Basically you are just squeezing White out into the center with the "toothpaste technique" (the marked stones): While White is pressed out, your stones get cut apart, which is bad shape. In this case it is no danger for you, since you are thick everywhere, but also it doesn't seem to profit you. So this kind of squeezing and pressing and pushing the opponent all over the board usually only makes sense if in the end you succeed in killing the group, which is, as stated above, rarely possible.

If you want to try it anyway, it probably would have been best to first start something on the left side (hoping for creating some leaning effect) and then see later, if - or how to most effectively attack the top right. But it's still risky ... I think I would count and see, if just playing A in sente is enough pointwise to get ahead in the game.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[ee];B[ff];W[eh];B[hg]TR[lg][ii]C[*Hon* So finally you got your net - White will not get out anymore. 

But will he also die? Or even suffer? If not, then what have you achieved? The two marked stones have been cut off, but they can still connect to other groups, and even if they don't, they will die rather small. In exchange, you solidified White's whole left side.]
;W[mc];B[ob];W[nb];B[oc];W[lb]LB[rc:A][fe:B]C[*Hon* So White lived. With this whole attacking operation you achieved a few things: Upper left is solid and alive, your upper right is connected and strong, you made White's top group smaller and your own bigger, preparing A, and you kept sente. 

What you lost, though, was the whole left side. I think, B was a real loss!]

Thanks for the review!

*Hon* I remember that, when I was a KGS 3k, I was also quite annoyed by KGS 2ks - even as 1k and 1d, I lost a lot of games against them. They really challenge you, maybe because 1d is close and they are very motivated ... ;-) 

No, I think, White has not played overly unreasonable. You failed in your attack of the lower left group, then missed the chance to take control of the lower right situation sufficiently, remaining slightly weakish in the center. Your opponent used this to "dance on your nose". Also I saw a tendency in your game not to consider enough how exactly you are going to profit from a fight. When there is no profit to get from attacking, it's frequently best to not attack at all (you can still aim at attacking, after the situation has changed and you see a way to actually get something out of it).

I would recommend practicing with the 123-principle and contemplate the idea (again), that go is not about "killing" or "surrounding points", but about control! With every move, defending your weakness, attacking the opponent's weakness, preferrably while getting some profit, try to grasp and then keep the control of the flow. If you use this as your guideline, you are less likely to make a serious fighting mistake (except misreads of course), like missing an urgent point. 

If you do this control thingy well, then, instead of going for the K.O., you lead your opponent through the game like a dog on a leash. Nothing frustrates him more than this: "Man, I tried so hard for 200 moves to catch up, but my opponent was 5 points ahead all the time and just stayed there ... I couldn't do anything! *sigh*" ;-)

Okay, I hope, this was of some help.

Even if this is a bit late: Happy new year, and good luck with your go!]

Okay, I am kind of contradicting myself here, saying that White should attack and not connect first; but the corner only needs one more move to live, and the outside stones, by surrounding and attacking, may become strong automatically. It's also a matter of reading and evaluating, but maybe you see, that whatever you do, you need to always consider your safety first.

If White can do this, then this will be quite annoying, right? You have to wriggle about, making life, and White will become strong in the center again ...

So the marked stone was safe AND big ... but preventing this surrounding action from White may have been more urgent. Your other group just ran out with A and will be able to handle herself.]

;W[rp];B[po];W[qr];B[oq];W[pr];B[ro];W[rq];B[ng]C[*Hon* After that, your right side is connected and strong, while the white group is weak all over again. You also get sente to cap like this and harass White.

Let me elaborate on this: If your lower right group is strong (of course you should be sure about that and read carefully), then you can use it as a "cliff, on which the enemy ship shatters". By capping and driving his boat toward your stone needle, this may become a real crisis for him!

Anyway, try to always make your decisions according to the 123 principle, getting strong yourself, weakening the enemy, and things will fall in place!]

(;B[nj]C[*Hon* I think it might be better to just go on with this, because you are surrounding your opponent on a large scale, also strengthening yourself.
