AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, my name is Tim Kington, and I'll be reviewing your game.  My rating hasn't been updated lately, but I'm somewhere around 2k.]
;W[dd];B[fq]C[In the opening, the biggest move is to take an open corner.  Next comes closing or approaching an asymmetrical corner, and then a move like this.  Playing in the lower right would be better.  This move doesn't give you the corner - you need C5 as well.]
;W[pp];B[qf]LB[cj:a][cf:b]C[This is okay, but I would prefer a move that works with your stones in the lower left like A or B.]
;W[pj];B[jj]C[This is almost a pass.  White has played all of his stones on the fourth line, so it's unlikely that you will get much going in the center here.  Even if there was hope for that, playing for influence is very difficult.  An extension along the side would be much easier to deal with.]
;W[dj];B[jd];W[lc];B[mc];W[le];B[md];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb]
(;B[jb]C[This is a mistake.  See variation.];W[jc];B[ic];W[kc]
;B[hd];W[gc]C[Now both players have a weak group to worry about.  It's much nicer when only the opponent has a weak group.]
;B[hc];W[fe];B[hf];W[jg]C[You can't really ignore a move like this.  Both players have a weak group at the top, and that's the most important thing going on here.  You should either stabilize your group, or attack White's.]

(;B[jp];W[lq];B[jq];W[hp]C[White has the wrong attitude in this game.  He just doesn't want you to have anything.  That's not the right way to think - you can let the opponent have territory - you just have to get a little bit more than he does.]
;B[hq];W[kr];B[jr]C[This isn't big enough to play right now.]
;W[fo];B[dn];W[cm];B[cn];W[bn];B[bo];W[bm];B[el]C[Good.  Attacking the white stones on a large scale like this is excellent.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[hl];B[jl];W[jn]C[I wouldn't feel good about leaving these two stones alone in the center.]
;B[qh];W[oh]
(;B[og]C[If you're thinking about territory here, this move isn't big enough.  If you're trying to attack the group at the top, tihs isn't the right point.]
;W[ri];B[rh]C[Again, this isn't big enough right now.];W[mg]
;B[lo]C[When you play a knight's move, if can be cut.  You have to have a plan for that in place.]
;W[kp];B[ko];W[jo];B[lp];W[kq]
(;B[pm]C[Looks like you didn't have a plan.  See variation.]

(;B[pk]C[Masuran [15k\]: I think this move was to deep, is the next variation better?

I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with this move.  Are you trying to make White's territory smaller, or make your group stronger?  The move you suggest is good for making your group stronger.]
;W[pl];B[ok];W[ol]
(;B[nl]C[Masuran [15k\]: Or is this where I lost the P9 group?

The P9 group just isn't that important.  It's only two stones.  this is good, I think - letting White come farther to the left ruins your eye shape.]
;W[nk]
(;B[oj]C[This is actually the big mistake.  Just let those stones go.  See variation.]

;W[fl];B[ek];W[hi];B[gh]C[I would say this is on the wrong side.  Your group to the right doesn't have eyes yet.]

(;B[ck]C[This doesn't quite work.  Also, it isn't big enough.  There are still some big points on the board.  The upper left and lower right corners are open to invasion, and more importantly your group at the top and White's group in the center are nearly dead.]
;W[dk];B[cl];W[dl];B[dm];W[bl];B[bk];W[ak];B[bi];W[bj];B[cj]
;W[ci];B[in]C[Good move.  I think H7 is probably simpler.];W[im]

(;B[go]C[This is a mistake.  Just take the stone, and White's dead.]

;W[hr]
(;B[ir]C[This is an outright mistake.];W[gq];B[hs];W[iq];B[ip]
;W[gs]C[Here you need to think about two things - keeping your stones alive, and keeping White from making eyes.  The stone at H1 isn't important for either of those goals.  If White takes it, he has a false eye.]

;B[ke];W[jf]
(;B[qr]C[You should just play the simple move here.  It looks like you're thinking about liberties in these life and death fights.  You should be thinking about eyes.]
;W[rp];B[sp];W[qs];B[rs];W[ps];B[os];W[id]C[Now we're in the endgame, and both players make a bunch of moves that are either worth zero, or -1 points.  This is worth -1 (white's playing in his own territory).]
;B[ha]C[-1 - giving White an extra prisoner.];W[gb]C[-1];B[ie]
C[-1 It seems like you gain a point by taking the prisoner, but you've uncovered a point for White so you break even, and you've given him one extra prisoner.]

Strategically, there were two things that stood out to me. 

First, you left the weak group at the top alone for so long that it died.  If you had played a couple more moves up there before leaving, the group would have been safe.

Second, it seems like when you are trying to kill a group, you're thinking about taking its liberties and getting the stones off the board.  Unless your surrounding stones are weak, you don't need to actually capture the stones.  You only need to make sure they can't create two eyes.  Thinking that way would have made the fight in the lower left a lot easier for you.

Feel free to mail me with any questions.])
