lemike [8k\]: good lucky];W[pp]C[juggal [7k\]: hey! have a nice game and fun!]
;B[dc]C[lemike [8k\]: like your hat];W[dq]C[This move is not wrong, but I think you need to be prepared to pincer the approach stone. Otherwise black's stones seem to work together. This may just be my style however.]
;B[do]
(;W[fp]C[I don't like this. A black group on the left works with b's corner]
;B[cq]
(;W[dp]LB[hp:B][hq:A]C[This helps black. He gets to strengthen his corner while decreasing your liberties.  Also, your stones are inefficient. Would you ever extend 1 space from two stones if the black stones were not there? (I hope not :) ). A and B are the ideal exensions from the two white stones. You should always look for an alternative to any move that creates a formation with 2 stones standing and a stone closer than A or B early in the game (regardless of move order.]
;B[cp]C[Note that your two stones have only half their original liberties, and now a black play at e5 might become a threat. Although th stone at f4 helps the two weak stones, it's realy bad that you are needing to help weak stones on your 4th move. D4 is a terrible move. I see lots of players your level making it and I think it tends to come from the fact that it's easy to predict black's response.]
(;W[de];B[dh]C[Black is gaining already. His stones are more efficeint. This pincer can lead to very complicated positions.]

C[This stone will compete with your upper right for life];B[nq]
