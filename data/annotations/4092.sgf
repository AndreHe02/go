hello, thanks for rewiew!

move 81 wrong?

**************

Hi there!

You submitted an interesting game for review, thanks for giving me the opportunity to review it.

I've done my best to point out both your and your opponent's mistakes (and good moves as well, of course :\] ), but please note that I'm only rated somewhere between 2-kyu and 1-kyu myself - so take everything I say sceptically and feel free to contact me in case you have any further questions or remarks.

My comments are preceded by "fey:", also make sure not to miss the variations I give along the way. I've added a brief summary at the end of the game.

Best wishes,

Nadja Sommerfeld

(;B[lc]C[fey: Interesting choice of joseki!
It works out nicely for Black if White plays as in the game, but note that White has another option aside of taking R17 - see the variation.

I reckon the 'normal' play of R17 would have certainly been an option worth considering here. (var.)]

(;W[qc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd];W[mc]TR[lc]C[fey: White should simply play O18 here, the normal joseki, or, as the ladder works for White in this case, the N16 hane is an option, too.
N17 is not only bad shape (the marked black stone becomes a hane at the head of two stones which is a good move in almost every case) but it also allows Black to confine White securely to the corner (the normal continuation without White's cut at M16 is shown in a var.)]
;B[md]
(;W[ld]C[fey: I unterstand why White doesn't want to play M18 here and I can't really scold him for this rather bold cut.
Probably White *has* to try something like this, but on the other hand Black will welcome every fight that might follow.

But instead of fighting, you also have the option of simply sacrificing M17 (if White wants those 15 points up there so badly, hey, ok, let him have his way) and building a giant moyo that will dictate the whole flow of the game.
This may be a matter of style above all, though.]
(;B[lb];W[nb];B[jc];W[kd];B[id]C[fey: This shape is a little strange, at least it's tempting to play K16 instead - that would take a liberty from White and threaten a ladder after White's L17 push.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[jd]C[fey: Filling his own liberties like this is usually not a good idea for White.]
;B[ic];W[hb]TR[kd][jd][ld][kc]C[fey: White misses the vital point and displays an agressive attitude which doesn't look appropriate in view of his marked stones which are very weak and on top of that short of liberties! 
This is a golden opportunity for Black to grab the important point that White rejected to play - see the var. and never let a chance like this slip away again! :)]

(;B[ie]C[fey: Though this is a good point, L14 would have been way better!
L14 is just the kind of move that has to strike you as being the only move. It's all shape - that's one of the great things about go, you needn't calculate everything precisely, you can just let stones flow smoothly by following your intuition and feeling for shape. Was it Kageyama (it still makes me so sad he died, I definitely adore his books!) who said "If you don't feel the same tightening in your chest as if you saw your lover when regarding this pattern, you don't love good shape enough."?
Of course one needs tactics to become strong, of course you have to be confident in your reading. But without some proper sense for shape, the tactical skill will get you nowhere.
Just try to trust good shape in your games, or better, let good shape inspire your play. :)]
;W[kf]C[fey: White should be really thankful here :/];B[ig]
;W[jf]C[fey: This peep doesn't gain White much, it would probably have been better played at N14 (another 'shape' move).]
;B[if];W[ib]C[fey: White is being a little unreasonable here, stating: "Black's group still isn't safe and I'm going to chase it 'round the whole board." - at least that's the feeling I get. ;)
Of course this exchange is sente (because White's own stones are still that weak!) but in view of the fact that Black's group is well out in the open and won't have problems to live while White's L16 group still looks really vulnerable, the J18/K18 exchange gains White close to nothing.

It's just that feeling I get while reviewing the game: White is playing rather agressively and disregards his own weaknesses quite often, but most of the time he gets away with it and obtains a superior result.
I don't really know what advice to give you in playing against people like that, I, myself, had problems playing against them, too, when I was around your strength. Maybe the key is just to be sceptic. If you are sure that your opponent just played an obvious overplay, go ahead, punish him. :) 
Spot the weaknesses he neglects to protect, protect while attacking, something like that.]
;B[jb];W[qi]TR[jd][kd][ld][kc][kf][jf]SQ[lh][lg]C[fey: Daring! White is gambling a bit here: While he's attacking from below, his marked stones are bound to come under serious attack.
M13 or M12 are looking like good starting points for a black counter now, I've tried a variation starting with the former.]

(;B[mf]C[fey: This is a little easy on White, as he still has the escaping move of L12 now.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[mg]
(;B[nf]C[fey: I'd like to fight back a little more here, your move just lets White escape happyly and enclose your stones in the meantime.
The first thing to think about here is how to split White's groups, the hane at O13  looks quite natural to me.]
;W[lg];B[qk]TR[md][nd][od][oc][pd][qf][nf][mf]C[fey: Well, I think this is a mistake in direction. Your marked stones have become rather weak and by playing from the lower side, you push White against them and force him to build strong outside influence by enclosing them. 
Of course the group isn't likely to die, but even to be forced to live with minimum eye space is usually quite painful.]
;W[oi];B[ph];W[pi];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qh];W[og];B[of]
C[fey: It would have been better to force at O13 or P12 first, as this gives you the opportunity to create cutting points in White's shape later. This way his wall is becoming just too solid.]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[pf];B[pe];W[oh];B[ng];W[nh]TR[qk][pn][pm]C[fey: Considering how reckless White played to begin with, he really gained here. Black's stones are completely enclosed, R9 looks as if it has been played too close to thickness now. Probably it would be sensible to reinforce it with Q6 or Q7 now, so that it doesn't come under attack as it did later.]
;B[mh]C[fey: Unfortunately it's not that easy to attack White anymore. In any case, cutting here immeadetely kills quite some aji, so better leave your options open.]
;W[mi];B[fp];W[lj];B[cn]C[fey: Good.];W[dn];B[dm];W[co];B[en]

(;W[bn]C[fey: Joseki is to simply play D5 here for White, as heavy and bad-shape-ish it may look. 
Actually White's choice of joseki is somehow questionably here as Black's outside influence is combining nicely with his right-side hoshi, perhaps the simply kosumi of E5 instead of D6 would have been better here.

See the var. for the usual joseki.]
(;B[cm]C[fey: Just capture at D5, that's not only a *very* thick move but also pressures White's corner group.]
;W[eo];B[em]C[fey: Still the capture would be better, or the blocking move of F5, of course. This E7 is just a little too submissive and White is more than happy to play F5.]
;W[fo];B[gp];W[nq];B[lq]TR[gp][fp]CR[qn][pq]C[here black collapsed because m3?

fey: Well, maybe your initial mistake was not to protect ar Q6 earlier on, but I don't think that M3 is bad. Every play on the right side would just make your marked stones an easy target for attack (you can't afford to simply sacrifice them from point of territory, I think), so the direction of M3 is fine.
It's just one of those typical situations when you have two weaknesses and can only protect one of them. b81 looks just reasonable. Having a weak group to look after now would be quite painful for Black, as White is quite thick in the center.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[fey: It's quite difficult to decide on a direction to block here, but I reckon I'd chose Q3 instead of your R4. (var.)
Its main advantage is his moyo-building potential towards the bottom which has much more potential to grow than the right side which remains quite thin with White's thickness facing it from above and therefore won't become much territory.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[oq];B[np]TR[qk]C[fey: The marked stone is too low and a little far away from your wall - keep in mind that powerful white stones above!]
;W[mp]
(;B[ok]C[fey: Again you are faced with two regions you'd like to play in simultaniously: the right side and the bottom. 
Maybe you should just try to get to play on both sides somehow, starting with the cut at N3, that's the only really convincing plan I can think of. I've added a variation containing some ideas.

P9 itself could maybe be played at P8, as this is a little tighter and may be better in front of white's strength. 
But I admit it's difficult to find a good move in this area; you'd like to exchange S3-S2-S4 before you reinforce here, but that's gote since it doesn't endanger the life of the white stones as in the variation.

On the other hand, a white play at S4 would be quite painful for Black, he doesn't want White to make his stones overconcentrated in sente.

Let's just conclude that R4 really wasn't the right direction to block. ;)]

(;W[pl]C[fey: White seems a little jealous here, S4 is more simple and good enough for him here, plus, it still preserves the aji of the Q8 peep and may even force Black to defend around there once more.

The move he played just looks greedy and overly agressive, though he is correct in assuming that the shape of your right-side stones is far from ideal and that there are weak spots that can be exploited. But to my mind, S4 is a more subtle and patient way to work with this aji.]
;B[pk];W[om]
(;B[nm]C[fey: Did you also have a plan for a white move at O8 now?
It might be better to silently connect at R7 here, as the result of the variation is inferior for Black.]

(;W[qo]
(;B[ro];W[rn];B[rp];W[ol];B[nl];W[ql];B[rl];W[rm];B[rk];W[rq]
;B[qm];W[pm]C[fey: As far as I can see, the capturing race becomes ko now - that's quite an interesting situation that developed here, I've analysed some variations on the way through it.
But let's just play on a little further and see how it continues...]
;B[po];W[qn];B[sn];W[sm];B[sl];W[so];B[sp]C[fey: This seems to be the best Black can do at this point...]
;W[no];B[sn];W[jq]C[fey: ...but it's quite hard to find a good ko threat for White, so he'll probably have to be satisfied with getting two moves in a row on the bottom.]
;B[qm];W[ho]C[fey: But it's also painful to take the ko - White's bottom has just become large. Maybe Black could continue playing the ko, but all in all once White starts it, Black has a difficult game because he can't afford to lose either the right side or the bottom stones.

The lesson to learn from this game is maybe "protect early on so that your weak spots won't cost you the game later".
Just take the time to get rid of weaknesses that would haunt you for the whole game otherwise. It's always a little hard to make 'slow' moves like that, and of course there are times when you just can't afford to lose speed, but in general it can't be bad to have strong positions everywhere.

You played well and reasonable for most of the time, but your main failure was to make nearly all of White's sometimes too agressive attacks a success.
So some advice always to be present in your mind: 
Don't be timid! Don't let your opponent dictate the flow of the game and push you around - this game was a good example for that - White attacked even when it was unreasonable, but sometimes Black just gave in and in the end even got the worse of it. I hope I could point out some ways how to fight back efficiently along the way.
Maybe re-read "Attack and Defense", some of the fundamentals explained there are really striking and should be remembered from time to time. :)

I also think that you could benefit a lot from some study concerning good and bad shape - usually that's not a dry concept to learn, it's nothing to memorize by heart, it's just some ideas that will really influence your game in a positive way.
There is also a book on the subject, "Making Good Shape", (I've never read it myself though), but you'll also find plenty of material for further study on the net, just senseis.xmp.net should provide you with everything you need.

I hope it doesn't seem as if I criticised too much, most of the comments are just suggestions and 'betters', and even more of them are only my own, personal opinion. (Go players always have different opinions about nearly every move, that's why sometimes the post-game analysis takes longer than the game itself ;-) )
Your strategy is pretty good and you held your initial advantage until the end of the game when White started invading your right side. As mentioned above, I think just looking at some tesuji problems and shape will improve your game by quite a lot.

Sorry if my comments were to extensive, I just tend to be kinda wordy when I once start typing (chatty girls at my age always do ;D ). Hopefully there were also some pointers you found useful - as always I'd be glad to hear which points you liked and where I could improve something.

It might get a little complicated if White switches to counterattack with something like K3, but lets just assume he'll play as tamely as this. ;)]
;B[nm]C[fey: P7 or something around there is also possible. Anyway, Black got to protect one of his weaknesses so far. Now it's White's turn to attack...]

(;W[ko];B[jq];W[lm]C[fey: This'd be the peacful way to settle things, but Black can be quite happy here as he even gained territory where he had two sore spots before. White's cut has become a little meaningless, so maybe he has to play more agressively (see the second var.).]

C[fey: Note that there's still aji for Black at S5 which either threatens to link up via S7 or push through at R5, so White might be better off answering your move at P7 and allowing a big black bottom moyo, but Black is going to have quite a good game this way, too.]

(;W[do]TR[em][cm]C[fey: The important issue now are Black's two cutting points, he can only protect one of them with the next move.
The usual one to guard is C7, as it is also big in terms of territory, but especially in handicap games it's quite common to protect E7 to gain outside influence.]
;B[cm]C[fey: I'd just play here as any White cut at E7 looks a little reckless now in view of Black's strong positions. (Cutting two living groups isn't of much use for White after all ;-) )]
;W[er]C[fey: ... so White could simply finish the joseki like this, undercutting Black's bottom and keeping the cut in reserve.]
;B[pn]C[fey: Black has sente to protect his only weakness on the board.
All in all Black has a promising game here, the position on the left can still grow and he can either take profit on the bottom or in the upper right corner.
Ok, White may have those two rather big-looking corners, but they are rather restricted in their potential and can't compete with Black's overall strength.]

It may be playable, but by looking at this position I get the feeling that Black's stones aren't working together efficiently while White's marked stone shines brightly and looks forward to either pressuring your J17/M17 group or invading  the right side in case it gets too big.]
))
(;B[qc];W[kc];B[pj]C[fey: White is quite low on the upper side (therefore maybe considering to play L17 on the fourth line or at M16 might be plausible), Black's right-side framework has lots of potential for growth.
