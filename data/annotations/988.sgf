C[Hi.

This was a moyo-oriented game. Black suddenly took the lead in the opening and I couldn't manage to take up.   Maybe you have some suggestions.

Thank you very much, Jorg.


It was an interesting game!
Both sides played well, but both also made a few misstakes.
I'm not an expert in the san-ren-sei fuseki. I hardly ever play it myself,
so my comments about the fuseki should be taken lightly. I think that
in the opening it is most important that one plays moves which one andurstands.
It is better to make a subobtimal move which one andurstands, than to make the
optimal move if one don't know the purpose of it.

I hope my comments can be of value to you

the left side]
(;B[jd]
(;W[dj]C[Is this ok? I thought it is a nice idea to keep black from building a double-wing formation. Also his sanren-sei strategy didn't work.

bom: It looks ok to me, see variations for some alternatives, I cant really say that  they
are better than this move.];B[nc]
(;W[oc]C[This is bad, perhaps one could even say that this is the game loosing move. White is forcing black into good shape. White should have played at r14 or q18 or maybe q14 instead.]

(;B[nd];W[pf]C[now k16 is at exactly the right position, and the corner can still easily be invaded at r17.]
;B[fc]C[Jorg - But he established a strong base at the top.]

(;W[df]C[Jorg - Maybe I had to press like I did on the other side?
No, pressing like that would be very bad for the same reasons as p17.
This looks ok, but since there is no hope to attack the black group at the top,
I think c14 is slightly better];B[fe]
(;W[fg]C[Jorg - I think this was too early. An approach at the lower left would have been better. What do you think?
I agree. c6 or r6 is better.];B[cn];W[qn];B[nq];W[on];B[ck]
C[This moove looks a bit strange];W[dk]C[Jorg - I played here because I feared that Black could build a big moyo if I took C10...
Good move!];B[cj];W[ci]

;W[fk];B[ph]
(;W[nf]C[Jorg - I tried to split the black stones. Maybe another move would be better, e.g. an diagonal move?
Black is very strong above, so a splitting attack won't work. After this move there should be no problem for black to settle himself on the right side. Also, remember the weakness at r17.]

(;W[cq]C[Jorg - Maybe a simple approach at F3 would be better?
f3 is not simple, black would turn the corner and the lower side into territory while chasing you.]

I think you played well here, and got a rather good result. Capturing the k5-stones is too
much to hope for.];B[hp];W[go]

(;W[ki]C[Jorg - Surrounding territory in the center is not good. But I had no other idea.

black is strong everywhere, so invasions does not seem possible, I don't see any really
big sente plays so l11 is perhaps the best white can do. b11 looks interesting too,
it is big and reverse sente, but black will probably play in the center himself instead of  answering.]
