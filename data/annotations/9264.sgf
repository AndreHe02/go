AB[pd][dp]C[While this game is a landslide victory for black, what I'm hoping to get out of this review is:

1. What did I do consistently wrong?  There is a pattern of loss in local fighting

2.  Was it related to a.  My inabilties at local fights or
                                 b. how I positioned myself on the board before the fights started
3.  What can I do to shift the outcome when I come across a playing style like this again?

Hey, my name is Simon. I a KGS 9 kyu under the name Ethelor.

I've had a look at the game and my first impressions are that this is quite an agressive game

Ill make comments on moves as they are made and give a summary at the end

Enjoy the review!];W[pp];B[dd];W[fc]LB[hc:C][cf:B][df:A]TR[ec]
C[S.

Black plays at the marked point

In the next move I explain why this isn't the best move

Better to play A, B or C

A or B are best because it keeps the game simple which black needs since white is two stones stronger]
;B[ec]LB[jc:A][fd:1][jd:B][df:2]C[S.

This move is called the "kick"

When you play this white plays at 1 and black follows up at 2

White then plays an extension at either A or B depending on what white wants

Normally the kick is not played unless you are able to attack white's formation as follows.]

(;W[fd];B[df];W[jc]C[I probably should have gone to K16 instead?
___
S.

Possibly, but then you leave your corner relatively weak

Best to not kick in the first place];B[gq]C[S.

This move is alright

Large keima simari isnt something I know too well

It is more complicated for sure because it has invasion points

Better to play the simpler small keima for now

However if you know this shape well then feel free to play it :)]
;W[nc]C[S.

This move is slow by white, he needs to play faster more agressive moves.

Black can laugh his way to the bank];B[oc]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[S.

We have already discussed why this kick is inferior

You just strengthen your opponent

You cannot pinder well here

Best to just back off at A or B];W[nd];B[qf];W[co];B[cm]C[Honestly, I'm at a complete loss on how to respond to pincers

S.

I am unsure what you mean by that, white is the one who has to respond ;)

Ill just assume that if you were in white's position you wouldnt know what to do.

White's stone is a little too close, he put himself in a bad position

Let's have a look at what the normal sequences are and come back to this]

(;W[cp]C[S.

Good that white neither jumps or goes into the corner because both end badly...

However this move is not great either];B[cq]C[S.

Good move];W[dq]LB[ep:A]C[S.

White must be agressive if he wants to gain anything

(He needs to be agressive anyway due to the handicap)

Note that extending at A is quite good for black]
(;B[eq];W[dr];B[ep]C[S.

better to extend right away

You just made white stronger by giving atari

There is a proverb not to atari cutting stones because you increase his liberties from 2 to 3

It doesnt help you];W[bq];B[er];W[cr];B[nq]C[S.

This is quite good, make use of your wall];W[ck];B[ci]C[S.

Best to simply jump out

Counter pincering just leads to a running fight and makes the game complicated for no reason other than for having complicated for the sake of it]
;W[ek]LB[cm:A]C[S.

After white's jump black's stone at A is starting to look a little sad...]

(;B[pj]LB[qn:A]C[S.

This move is a little slow, id say to either save your stone

Better yet, 

Play at A

Pincering the stone like that is quite good for you];W[lq];B[pq]
C[S.

This attachment isn't recommended

You just make your opponent stronger];W[qq];B[op];W[qp];B[pn]
C[S.

Remember that the keima can be cut, you are asking for trouble with this move

A one point jump is stronger]
(;W[qn]C[S.

White is very nice when he attaches at A];B[qm];W[pm]C[S.

Maybe not that nice, Remember to simply extend unless the atari is something you can gain from

Not this situation though];B[qo];W[rn];B[ql];W[po];B[on];W[oo]
C[S.

See? You are now cut off];B[om];W[np]
(;B[kr]C[S.

Good, abandon those stones for now

They are a liability

This move underneath isn't that strong

It is in sente but you dont have anywhere to go from here

You just get your head hit (Explained in future moves)];W[lr]
;B[kq]C[S.

This move is not very good

Let's have a look at some other ideas];W[kp]C[S.

Im sure you know the proverb to "his the head of two"

Your move at L3 was asking for it

There is no need to have your head hit at this time];B[jp];W[jq]
C[S.

One of the reasons why getting your head hit is not preferable]
;B[ko];W[lp];B[jr];W[iq];B[ip]C[S.

By using so many ataris you just make your shape weak and full of aji]
;W[ir];B[hq]C[At this point I've kind of identified this opponent as a "close quarters" "street fighter" style that I am unaccustomed to.
___

S.
I wouldn't say your opponent is very agressive, you just leave a lot of weakness for him to exploit

I often have the same problem in my games. I am personally weak against hyperagressive or trick players

However, looking back on many of my games now that I have become stronger reveals that my shape was propperly weak and I myself would exploit those cuts if I was my own opponent.]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[js];B[hs];W[ks]C[S.

Black is obviously quite sad with this result];B[ds];W[jo];B[io]
;W[jn];B[in];W[kn];B[nf]CR[pd]LB[oe:A][qf:B][pg:C]C[S.

This jump is alright if you know the key points

The connection between the two circled stones is called the elephants eye jump

it is a very weak jump only used when A is not a very good move for white

If white plays in A black is still connected if he has stones at C and B

That means in this case if white plays at A he will only strengthen you

Your territory is vastly expanded, good job]
(;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[S.

Wrong direction];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[qb];W[rb];B[qa]
;W[ra];B[pb];W[sc];B[se];W[en]C[S.

Good move, captures your stone and reduces your teritory

That hurt];B[do];W[dn];B[fo];W[ph]C[S.

This is a very deep invasion by white

He shouldnt be able to get away with this]
(;B[pg]C[S.

This attachment only makes him stronger];W[oh];B[nh]C[S.

As does this

Please note: playing in his eye space is better than taking away all his liberties one by one

As long as he has no eyes it doesnt matter how many liberties he has

By attaching desperately like this you only leave cutting points for him to exploit]
;W[og];B[of];W[ng];B[mf];W[mg]C[S.

White is free now

Not alive but not dead either];B[ff];W[ee];B[de];W[ef];B[eg]
;W[fg]
(;B[eh];W[gf];B[kd];W[le]C[Was really unsure of his play and my response.  It felt really weak however I was pretty down  at this point.

S.

This is a variation of what I showed you earlier

Note: The elephant eye jump is only good when white's move just now is't any good

However, since it is the jump is very easily cut and now that stone is dead unless you can struggle and make it live somehow]
;B[fe];W[ge];B[fb];W[gb];B[fa];W[ga];B[db];W[bi];B[bj];W[di]
C[S.

At this point your opponent can see you are frustrated and exhausted

He playes this move expecting to finish you off

He expects you to panic on this move

However, this move isnt very good if you respond correctly

You can make white pay dearly]
(;B[bh];W[ch];B[ai];W[dh];B[cg];W[dg];B[cf];W[fh];B[bk];W[cj]
C[S.

Dont stave that stone

That one point is worth more to you dead than alive

Connect to your "dead" stone and take white's points away from him]

(;B[bi];W[bl];B[cl];W[dl];B[dj]C[S.

Very well spotted];W[ei];B[dk];W[cn];B[bm];W[bn];B[am];W[ej]
;B[ck]C[S.

No need];W[lf];B[ni]LB[lg:A]C[S.

You must cut white off at A or else that group is alive

After that you can say goodbye to a lot of points];W[oi];B[nj]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[qj];B[qk];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[ml];W[mj];B[lk]
C[S.

Once again, taking his liberties one by one isnt a good use of stones

Either take away eye shape or strengthen yourself

Since he is already connected do your best to minimize your losses]
;W[qi]
(;B[kk]C[S.

Once again, its clear to see that you are tired from this match. :/]
;W[mi];B[ll];W[ji];B[ik];W[oe];B[pe];W[nb];B[qh];W[rh]LB[rc:F]
[kd:D][pi:C][jk:E][fq:A][or:B]C[I resigned at this point feeling there was no way to turn game around
I feel that I lost by local fights however not totally certain.
Thank you for the review.

S.

Id say you lost because you made simple mistakes.

Let's highlight the places on the board where the biggest mistakes were made

6 very large mistakes that I have covered

Note that the letters indicate areas as opposed to moves

I believe i have already covered these but in summary:

A 
  ->Wall turned out to make very few points, this was due to getting your head hit and leaving lots of cutting points and aji
  ->Next time don't get your head hit and try to play a contact move instead of peeping on the 2nd line where your position is inferior

B
  ->You failed to jump out because you used a keima which can be broken
  -> Use a one point jump to jump into the center, proberbs say this is never bad

C
  -> You tried to kill white too desperately by attaching to him everywhere
  -> Kill by placing stones one space away from what you want to kill this removes eye space and is endlessly more efficient than taking the liberties away one by one

D
  -> You simply played far too deep into his teritory and were cut off right away since your conection was weak. 
  ->Once again, one pont jumps are your friend ;) They are much more difficult to break where as the elephants eye is one of the easiest to break

E
  ->While not game losing, moves like this which have no real aim are almost never of benefit, I understand that you were frustrated and tired but still. Remember that often in a very even match the game can be decided by the one who is able to concentrate for the longest time

F
  ->The corner was fully enclosed but white still lived because you didn't know how to kill him
  ->On a board try figuring out different ways to kill white when you have the enclosed corner


Ive tried to give you the best review that I possibly could. Let me know on KGS if you have any questions.

You can also send me an email at simon@thornewill.org, I check my email multiple times a day so ill be able to answer you swiftly.

I think you have a lot of potential as a go player. I understand I was very harsh with my review and it's a lot to take in. However, if you continue to study go by reading books, watching videos and most importantly, playing games you will improve.

If you have some spare cash I highly recommend Badukmovies (some are free)

If not then nick sibicky and batt's go lectures on youtube are also of very high quality and I highly recommend them.

Good luck, and see you around ;)

You should know all of them

Note that I said that white is at a disadvantage because he cannot play the joseki where he jumps 

White will want to make moves at 1, 2 or 3

1 and 2 are now not possible because black is peeping the jump and the keima can be easily cut]

(;AW[cn]AB[cl]AE[cm][co][gq]CR[cl]LB[en:B][cq:A]C[S.

It is white's turn to move, black just played the pincer
