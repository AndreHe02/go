C[I was black in this game. I feel that I have lost mainly because I played some slow moves at some point. Any comment on how to improve my game are appreciated. I have a few specific questions during the game.




(doitsu) : Its hard for me to say at which point a game was lost. The white dragon in the middle surely is a reason as there are technical as well as strategical reasons for this to happen. I am not such a strong player, but i think i can make some helpful remarks on your middle game :)

My  variations are just thoughts. I am completely convinced that a x-dan might find better clues and bugs in my investigations and advices. Nevertheless i hope they will help you and show up some alternatives.]

;W[eq]LB[cn:C][fp:A][eq:B]C[White should answer around C6, as far as I know. A contact move shouldn't be good for white here, is this correct? But I don't know how to answer it anyway. The exchange in the game seems good for white. Maybe invade at C3?




(doitsu) : I think your response at 'A' is OK. The opening is a hard subject. The question about W 'B' or 'C' is to subtle for me to investigate - but i will give a comment to this in a few moves.]
;B[fp];W[dm];B[fc]LB[fq:B][jq:A]C[



(doitsu) : I think: As you left out a move like 'A' your group at 'B' is more likely to become weak. I think its a good advice not to accept a weak group in the opening without some charge back. See the variation for a possible danger.]

(doitsu) :

Before you do anything else, you read this: http://senseis.xmp.net/?FocalPlays


W has not a single weak group. Your potentially weak group still lies at 'A'.  look where your mojos meet( focal points). Actually your move at B was the right way to think. 'C' and 'D' are better points in my opinion - particularly C because this would also strengthen your weak group.

In my opinion weak groups are the key to understand the middle game as well as the opening.

(doitsu) : Let him run - but hell yes, rob off his base first with a move at 'A' or 'B' If you think like "I take the center" then I have to say: Well there are some guys who are so keen on territory that they would murder for 2nd line crawls - well in such cases take the center. In any other case: Forget it. Too many ways to poke in.

(doitsu) : A tragedy. Both of you misjudged the severity of this problem. That's why it was played out so late in the game. I assume that W knew about the ko, that's why he tried to run. But already the area around A is much to likely to become eye space to ignore it. As the game was clearly lost in this sequence (due to procrastination) there is just one last advice i can tell you:

Some people play Go in a psychological way. They like to scare you and confuse you. Such people tend to leave important situations unplayed, because they know they will have no chance, if your focus stays there. That's not evil - after all Go is just a game :) (maybe their thought also goes like "Naaah - big groups never get killed!") If you are curious what will happen, just play on the psychological game with you opponent :)

But at some point i just enjoy to decide this sort of game and quit the hocus-pocus by simply killing "the large group" and let my opponent have the little corner, by which he was trying to lure me instead. Just don't be anxious to

PULL IT THROUGH


No more comments follow - I hope you enjoyed my comments just as i enjoyed to watch this interesting game :)]

(doitsu) : Now you will have to worry about 'A' - and your wall at 'B' has been bent.  Corners are quite small and you give a lot of influence with a 3-3 invasion.  The reason why you want to defend your corners in a kakari situation is because you can live there without being shut in - which is a perfect start to build influence.

Just let the others get the corners under a 4-4 point and learn to -> attack the weak groups they build when they start to do the mistake of ->playing near your thickness.


http://senseis.xmp.net/?HowToAttack
http://senseis.xmp.net/?PlayAwayFromThickness

Of course in some situations (like a double wing) a corner invasion is just a bunch of free points and can be played without much side effects (like when the influence you give during the invasion is already present) ... and sometimes you just have no choice but to invade.]
