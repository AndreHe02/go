C[jackchen8 [2k\]: hi
peterchris [3k\]: Hi, I'm peterchris, I played black.  I've noted about 5 specific questions through the middle of the game.  Thanks very much for your help! Peter]
;B[qd];W[dp]C[peterchris [3k\]: hi hf];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]C[apparently, this is a very popular fuseki. i haven't studied it before, but i've done some database searching to be able to comment]
;W[ce]C[Roughly half the time white does this]
(;B[cf];W[cd]C[Black plays like this for a significant portion of the remaining search results. In pro games, statistically white has a 5% edge. Of course that probably means little for us amateurs..]

(;B[dg];W[fc]
(;B[dk]C[peterchris [3k\]: How can I know whether to play high or low here - D9 vs C9?

The intention of D13 is to be able to make an extra line's extension, for the purpose of territorial efficiency. So, C9 is the proper move. D9, a move oriented towards influence, is at odds with the defect-littered shape of D13.]

(;W[oc]
(;B[ld]C[peterchris [3k\]: Again, how to know, high or low - M16 or M17?

To answer this question, first you must ask yourself why you are playing the pincer.

With F17 present, the top becomes a less interesting area for both players. It is a low but very solid stone. If black attempts to develop, white has the backup to invade without any fear. On the other hand, white developing from that solid stone will be slow, as black will have no problem using moves like G14 & G16 to keep the top side restricted to a low position.

Instead, black should look to the right side. He has Q4, which is naturally inclined to develop the surrounding areas quickly. Joining R16 with Q4 in a framework would make a good strategy, especially with all of your stones on the left side being on the 4th line. 

I'll illustrate some of these ideas with a few variations.

Your intention with the pincer is probably to prevent white from developing the top. Disregarding that the top is not the most interesting part of the board, the high pincer is correct for this task. As it is on the 4th line, it is easy to treat it lightly and to run away with it if necessary. A 3rd line stone represents more of an investment in the area and you would probably feel compelled to attend to it by giving it a base and replying to any attacks white uses against it. The only recorded case of M17 being used in the top pattern (with the white shape from game in top left) was in 1932, by Kitani Minoru. The strategy worked for him, but he was a top pro of the time, and it was at the end of the fuseki rather than near the start of it.]

It doesn't seem so. You build wall towards the center, but it is probably better to just block off white from the bottom entirely. See the variation.]

K4 was a terrible overplay. It was a move played right next to your thickness with no real backup. After taking N2 in sente, your next aim should be to punish this insult.]
