C[Hi, i'm Jeff, and I'll be commenting on your game. I'll put my comments above any that you've made to make it clear where I've mentioned things. I tried to support all my claims with examples, but I am still learning too! So hopefully I can help you to the best of my knowledge and give you some things to work on. If you have any questions or comments (about what I've said), please feel free to email me at wardjm@gmail.com . Keep in mind that there are better moves, and I've just mentioned the best ones to my current ability.]
;B[jd];W[dd];B[gg]C[Jeff: On a full sized board, I agree that the middle is bad to play in the beginning. Here, though, since black plays first, it is a good influential stone.

I feel as if this is not a good move because it allows me to capture the edges of the board.  I just am not sure how to take full advantage of this move.]

(;W[dj]LB[jj:A][hk:B]C[Jeff: Not bad. I've played a variation that I'm sure is not the best, but it should give you some ideas to keep your mind open.]
;B[jj];W[hc];B[ej]C[Jeff: Usually when your the other player touches you, it allows you to gain strength! Play what's called 'hane'. I've shown some variations.

Should I ignore the threat? Or try to build territory in a small fight?]

(;W[cg]C[Jeff: It's hard to say here. I consider this a pretty decent move. One line higher would be fine too. Don't forget that playing too high allows the other player to sneak underneath more easily.

Would moving closer to the center be more beneficial?];B[fd]
C[Jeff: You probably don't want to ignore this.]
(;W[kg]C[Jeff: Good eye, but you want to work towards attacking there rather than diving right in. See variation.]
;B[dk];W[cj];B[di];W[ci];B[ck];W[dh];B[ei]C[Jeff: Your opponents best move is usually your best move. And remember that touching strengthens. I've listed some potential strong next moves, but there are so many variations off them that I only played to first one. Hopefully this helps clarify what's more important.]

;B[cb]C[I feel that if black went at B10 he would have taken my piece in the corner and made a small territory there.]
;W[bd];B[hb];W[bb];B[ai];W[bg];B[ah];W[ag];B[aj]C[Jeff: Good endgame instincts.]
;W[ca];B[hh]C[Jeff: I don't believe this did anything just for reference.]

(;W[fj]TR[ih][ek]SQ[gh]C[Jeff: Interesting choice. Usually, you want to go after a cutting point. Square might be the best option, but it's going to be a tough battle no matter what. My variation virtually ends where you played in one move.

I ended up loosing this battle and some pieces.  I'm not sure how I should have gone about attacking his open space.]

(;B[ek];W[fk];B[fl];W[gl];B[el];W[ij]C[Jeff: This is good. Looks like you could make something out of it yet.]
;B[hj]C[Jeff: Okay, I think I've played around with enough variations for you on this move. Keep in mind that it is better to stay connected and to always work towards your own stones and towards gaining territory. Don't worry about killing things too much.]

;W[me];B[hm];W[gb]C[Jeff: Overall, you seem to have  a good sense of things. The most important advice is to keep playing, and it will come naturally after a while. The most improvement comes just from having seen similar situations over and over again. You get a good sense of what works and doesn't even if you don't remember exactly how it played out the last time. Good luck!]
