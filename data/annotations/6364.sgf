AB[pd][dp]C[I think white is stronger than 2k

I think you let him get away with too many overplays :)

;B[fe]C[bajie88 [2k?\]: hi
I think is dificult for him to link his stones. With that move I hope to be able to attack d13]
;W[gc];B[cc]C[I try to make a base and later attack d13];W[cb]
;B[cd];W[ed]C[Not a good move: White wants to strengthen his 2 space extension but in fact he is helping Black.
 -- jantje --];B[ee];W[bb]
(;B[di]LB[ci:A][dj:B][dk:C]C[I think this is a vital point

Pincering is the right idea. Finding the precise spot, however, is quite difficult. In my opinion A, B and C could be slightly better than your move: A, because it makes an immediate connection possible, and B and C for two reasons:
1) they are further away from D13 which means that you will have more freedom in the upper part of the fight (when D13 starts walking a stone at D10 or D9 is less of a concern than a stone at D11), and 2) they put more pressure on C6. I'd play D10 myself. -- jantje --]
;W[eh];B[fd]C[Not good! You are repaying the favor W did to you when he played E16, and with interest!
Please don't just take my word for it, but study yourself how much this strengthens White and how little it helps Black.  -- jantje --]
;W[fc]C[I have the impression that saomething go wrong. I know is bad to chase from behind and is bad too to let him cap with h15, but if I scape, d11 is in problems

It is interesting that you start complaining right after your first dubious move. You are the only person who knows whether your mistake caused your pessimism or the other way around :)
-- jantje --];B[he]C[I think is the best. later I'll play j17

Assuming that your opponent falls asleep, that is...
Always expect that your opponent will play the best move. 
-- jantje --];W[id];B[cl]C[I try to make a base and attack the two stones. But I see that the F16 group is not alive and I think I'll have problems in the future. I feel IÂ´ve not played well in a handi game

Good move and played for a good reason. You lost some ground on the top but nothing serious has happened yet. -- jantje --]
;W[en];B[gh]TR[id]C[D4 will live but this group can have problems. Better to take care of him

Another good move. There is no development of your upper group towards the right because of the marked stone, therefore it must go to the centre. And you are attacking White!
Your last two moves have the kind of flow that one should strive for: first C8 strengthens D11, then G12 makes use of that strength to attack. -- jantje --]
;W[gi];B[ei]C[reinforcing this grup and threating f12

OK -- jantje --];W[gg]C[I didnt see this move]
(;B[if]C[White's last move may have been a surprise to you, but what on earth possessed you to play this spiritless move?
The fight is on now, and you cannot walk away from it. In Go, keeping up your will to fight (kiai) is almost more important than having a good position. 
In the variations I am exploring some lines how the fight could have continued, just to give you an idea.
-- jantje --];W[hh];B[fi];W[fh]C[Please take a moment to consider what you've done: the White group that you wanted to attack now has made a ponnuki in the centre of the board. In this position the proverb "the ponnuki is worth 30 points" is not an exaggeration.
-- jantje --];B[fp]C[Is better to reinforce the other two groups? I think now they have no big problems an I have to make territory. Anyway Im attacking c6, and that will help d11

This move is excellent, but for now Black can forget about attacking since White has become too strong. -- jantje --]
;W[hq]C[In normal circumstances this would be an overplay, but here White can risk it because of the ponnuki. -- jantje --]
;B[hp]C[The important thing is to keep W separated. -- jantje --]
;W[ip];B[gq]LB[ho:A]C[A is probably better, because the W stones in the centre will start to coordinate well now.]
;W[ho];B[gp];W[iq]LB[io:A]C[In White's position I would have connected at A, emphasizing the centre. -- jantje --]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[bh];W[bg];B[fn];W[fm];B[gn];W[dk];B[ck];W[fk]
;B[dl];W[em];B[ek]C[Making sure the life];W[cq]C[Somewhat impudent but it seems possible! -- jantje --]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[er];B[bn]LB[fr:A]C[Making sure the life

Why not A first? -- jantje --];W[gr]C[You should not have let White connect so easily. -- jantje --]
;B[kf]C[Now I have to make sure this group live];W[kd];B[nc]
C[I have to make territory too. I aim L18

By now you have probably lost your 2H advantage. But the game is not hopeless yet! I thinks your last move is OK, since chasing your upper left group should not give W much here. -- jantje --]
;W[lf];B[ke]TR[kd]C[That is not a good idea because you are banging your head against White's marked stone. -- jantje --]
;W[le];B[kh];W[lg]
(;B[jh]LB[lh:A]C[This is too defensive, I believe. If you had played, for example, at A, I don't think White could have cut. See variation.
-- jantje --];W[mi]C[I see the problem of his wall but I dont know what to do. Maybe o17 was no good. Maybe was better to attack the left white group, but is very big

Attacking the White group is slowly becoming possible, as you say. But this is only because of White's last few moves. 
Note how White is slowly "spending" the strength of his ponnuki: during the last few moves he has forced the Black top group to bend around, building the wall you speak of. This was possible because the White left side group is so strong, but it is less strong now than before. 
I draw attention to this because it is the normal way of things in Go: to make use of a strong group you push your enemy's groups against it, but this reduces the strength! -- jantje --]
;B[jk]C[Great move! Suddenly White has to take care of his left side group that was so strong before. -- jantje --]
;W[im]LB[hl:A][hk:B]C[I think White should have played at A instead. If you had played B now it might have been hard to answer.
This remains possible for the next few moves. -- jantje --]
;B[lk];W[kl];B[kk];W[nk];B[ll];W[np];B[oq]LB[pn:A]C[Not good, strengthening White. A is better. -- jantje --]
;W[nq];B[lo];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qq]LB[op:A]C[Too defensive. A is a better move for Black.]
;W[or]LB[hk:A]C[All the time the vital point at A is unplayed!]
;B[km];W[op];B[pq];W[pr];B[qr];W[qn];B[ro];W[hl]C[Now White is safe and should have a won game. -- jantje --]
;B[lq];W[rn]C[Is this move sente? I don't think so! See variation.
-- jantje --]
(;B[rp]LB[ps:A]C[As explained I believe this is unnecessary and therefore bad (it is not as if Black has time for unnecessary moves here!). If you are convinced White's last move is sente, then you must at least force with A first. 
The idea of that is that White will certainly answer A to keep up his threat against the corner, later he has more freedom whether or not to answer A when it comes. -- jantje --]
;W[qf]LB[hk:A][rp:B]C[I was afraid of this move, but I didnt see the moment to avoid this, because my center group was in danger.

There were two opportunities for you: to play at A at the right moment, and to avoid defending unnecessarily at B.
-- jantje --];B[of]LB[rd:A]C[This move and A are miai. -- jantje --]
;W[rd];B[oh];W[pg]C[Here White's peep is excellent! (compare E16 in the beginning of the game)
-- jantje --];B[og];W[pi];B[oi];W[pj];B[qc];W[lc];B[ol]C[This is bad

yes :(
-- jantje --];W[nl];B[ph];W[qh];B[mb];W[rc];B[rb];W[lb];B[gj]
C[Now I attack

There should be no attack here, but White is going to help you.
-- jantje --];W[hj];B[gk];W[hk]LB[gl:A]C[Maybe A is slightly better, but this should also be OK for White.
-- jantje -];B[gm];W[gl];B[fj]
(;W[fl]C[White is really flirting with disaster now! But he probably had missed the clever cutting sequence that Black is now springing on him.

Well, not quite :)

;B[ag];W[af]LB[gf:A]C[Now A for Black threatens to kill either directly or by ko. It is a pity a) that you did not see it and b) that you wasted some ko threats on the previous moves.

C[blas [4k\]: thx
bajie88 [1d?\]: thx

The position is not really played out! (see variation)

In this final position I have marked what I believe to be your worst moves of this game; and another 'worst move' is the move you did not play at H9 during a few moves, when this would have been a sharp attack on White.

Is there a common denominator to your mistakes? Perhaps that your were too timid to take control of the game, which in turn might have to do with the psychology of a handicap game. 

Anyway, don't feel bad about your mistakes and remember that the reviewer has the advantage of hindsight.

Hope you enjoy the review as much as I enjoyed the reviewing!
-- jantje --];B[gf];W[fg];B[hg]C[Aargh!
Please consider by yourself how this ko fight would have turned out.
(I think it would make White sweat but might not be enough for a Black win)
-- jantje --])
(;B[dd];W[ec];B[cf];W[bf];B[ag]C[I didnt see this

Exactly! Even at this late stage this might have won you the game. White can live, but the question is at how much damage to his game. 
It is a bit complicated, so please consider the following variation as an invitation for further study!
