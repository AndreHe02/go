(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[Hello!  I've been playing Go for only two months.  I've read a
couple books, but my knowledge of the game is still pretty basic.
I would love any general comments you could make about this game,  especially things you feel I need to work on the most.  (ASIDE from
thinking through close tactical battles thoroughly: that's one
thing I learned from this game!)

Thank you!
