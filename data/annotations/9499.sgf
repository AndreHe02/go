;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pq];B[fd];W[mc]LB[dj:A]C[I would prefer to approach the black shimari in the upper left corner at A. This keeps black from setting up a large potential easily and at the same time it is a nice extension from the white corner stone.]
;B[jc];W[pb];B[qc];W[oc];B[qg];W[qb];B[lb];W[mb];B[lc]C[This move helps white to get out into the center and put a little pressure on the three black stones on the right side.]
;W[me];B[qo];W[mp];B[ql];W[jp]TR[mp][pq]LB[dj:A][qp:B][rp:C]
C[I guess a move around A is bigger, between the black and white positions. If black would invade the lower side, then white could, if necessary, secure eye space for the marked stones with B or C.]
;B[fq];W[hq]LB[cn:A][eq:B][fp:C]C[A move at A seems better to me as it strengthens the lonely corner stone and moves into the last open part of the board. Also, the three white stones to the right are allready strong.
Another idea may be to first exchange B for C before playing A.]

(;B[es]C[Mistake. See variation.];W[cs]C[This last exchange is bad for black. It costs him a precious liberty.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[fo];W[ep]TR[cs][es]C[If black had not exchanged the marked stones, then white could not have played this way.]
;B[en];W[go]LB[gh:a]C[This is perhaps white´s worst mistake in the game. Black has build up a large potential on the left side and it is crucial that white immediately starts reducing or invading it. This move helps black to get even stronger while white only adds a few points to a position that was allready strong anyway.

I find it difficult to say what would be the best way to deal with the black potential. Perhaps a reducing move at A. Going in deeper seems dangerous to me. Another possibility may be to do something in the upper left corner. But I´m not sure what exactly.]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[hn];W[io];B[in]LB[kf:a][jm:b]C[Locally I think a black move at B would make better shape. Globally I like black A to make the potential really big and to force white to risk some kind of invasion.]
;W[jn]C[Locally this move makes nice shape, but black and white are both allready very strong here. The proverb advices to play away from strenth. It is really urgent that white starts doing something about the black potential.]
;B[ci]LB[kf:a]C[Here white is lucky. This move is way too submissive. I still think black should play a move like A instead and let white invade. Even if white manages to make a living group, white will not be able to destroy everything. While attacking black coulld build up strength and in any case white will not be able too care about anything else beside his invading group.]
;W[hc]C[I guess an invasion is necessary now. I do not see an easy way for white to invade successfully . This point seems interesting. I will comment more on black´s mistakes that allowed white to be successfull.]
;B[hd];W[id]
(;B[ic]TR[jc][lc][lb]C[I think black should sacrifice the marked stones and protect his potential. See variation.]
;W[gd]
(;B[gc]C[Black could put up more of a fight here. See var.]
;W[he];B[hb];W[hd];B[fb]C[Black gets a few points at the side while white does great damage to his potential.]
;W[fe];B[ed];W[ee];B[de];W[dg]LB[ef:A][je:B][fg:C][gf:D][hg:E]
C[This looks like an overplay to me. Black can cut at
A. White also needs a plan for the case black would cut at B. Perhaps white could play at C to prepare for the move just played and to be able to answer a black probe at D with E, so it becomes more difficult for black to destroy white eye space.]
;B[cf]C[Again, black plays submissive.];W[cg]LB[ef:A]C[The danger of a black cut at A is still there.]
;B[fi];W[fg]TR[an][bm][bo][cn][dn][en][fo][gn][hn][in]C[Another submissive move. Black lets white connect in good shape and uses his strong wall only to make a few points of territory and not to attack.]
;B[ii];W[jl];B[hl]LB[eh:A][eg:B][je:C][rb:D]C[I think black should play a little more active. Perhaps first exchange A for B. Then play C, let white think about how to make eyes for his group and then play D to put some pressure on the white group in the upper right while at the same time strengthening his own group and taking some points in the corner.]
;W[ik];B[hk];W[di];B[dj];W[ei];B[ej];W[bg];B[fh];W[eg];B[bf]
;W[aj]LB[qj:A]C[I think a move on the right sight would be bigger. Black is thin there. A move in the lower right corner would not only take points, but could also make an invasion at A dangerous for black]
;B[bj];W[ah];B[bk];W[ak]C[This is way too small at this stage of the game.]

;W[li];B[od];W[nd];B[ma];W[na];B[la];W[af];B[be];W[qp]C[Big. Black is way behind. After he created his large potential he played very submissive. This helped your invasion turn into a success.

I like your shape and your calm playing style. My main advice would be to try to play away from thickness more, to be aware of your opponent building up large potential territiories and to start reducing/invading in time.]
