C[Hi!  It's been a little while since I played but I will provide the best feedback possible.  If you have any additional questions about my comments, don't hesitate to send me an email and I'd be happy to discuss them.  When I comment, if there's an alternate sequence, it'll start a move back.

My knowledge of the opening game is still shaky so I'll mainly focus on the mid-late game, questions/comments/observations you made, and any additional spots where I feel I can provide some useful commentary.]

(;B[qo]C[I think R6 would've been better.

Perhaps, but I don't think R5 was a bad move.  I think there were mistakes in subsequent play that made it look not as effective as it could have been.]

(;B[pn]LB[pn:B][po:A]SQ[qo][pp][qp]C[I was going to sacrifice those stones for influence on the side and center, but I didn't follow through with the plan.

While that's not a bad plan, you can actually have you cake and eat it too in this situation by playing at A instead of B.

Beacause of the situation with the square group, the pressure put on by the B move doesnt' really work as pressure.]

(;B[dg]LB[eg:A]SQ[ed][ce][ee]C[Why extend inward?  Are you worried about getting surrounded?  A is still a safe move and doesn't leave the square group vulnerable.]
;W[fh];B[dj];W[qe]LB[od:B][oe:A]C[Here, White's setting a stone down in the middle of a giant black influenced space.  No need to hold back here, you can be more aggresive with a play at A instead of B.  That gives you better control over your territory and puts more direct pressure on White.]
;B[od];W[of];B[me];W[qc]C[Maybe I was too passive with this attack. The goal during the game was to attack his white stones while gaining top territory. He ended up with 2 more points of territory than me, so maybe I could've played this more aggressively.

I think that's a good analysis.  Playing aggressively is more dangerous, but playing defensively can cost you the game.  There's often a balance that has to be struck.  I think in this case, you're right that you didn't respond aggressively enough to many of his attacks.  And when you're looking at this point in the game, you can still go for the top and the bottom.  Don't sell yourself short by only focusing on the one area.  there's enough space that you can really make something happen.]
;B[mg];W[oh];B[ni];W[lh];B[mh];W[lg];B[co]LB[lg:A]C[I like this play.  A wasn't a threat to anything so you ignored it and made an agressive move of your own.  Nice.]

I agree with you on carving into his center territory more.  A few possible alternatives might be A,B]

;W[ek];B[el];W[fl];B[kl];W[jl];B[jm]C[The danger with a move like this, is that you're isolating yourself from any large group of your stones close by and setting yourself down in the middle of a large white influence.  So it's harder to secure a cut like this without any support stones in the area you're cutting into.  It's not that you can't do it, but it helps to have as clear a vision as possible as to how you're planning ot connect everything.]

Definitely.  Problems are always a good idea.  They arent' the end-all, be-all of practice but they're a good supplement.  The other benefit of life or death sequences is that they can be done in a short amount of time.  So if you only have 10 minutes, you can sit down and do one or two and still learn something even if you can't play a full game.]

(;B[es]LB[fr:A]C[This may have been my mistake. I got greedy because I thought life was secured.

I think you're right there, playing where white plays next would have allowed you to keep moving out while keeping you safe.]

(;B[hp]SQ[fm][gm][hm][fn][fo][go][gp][hq]C[I think your mistake here was trying to save everything.  If you had let these stones die, you would have kept the larger group alive.]

Nice!  Excellent move.  One of the many big things about go is learning when something is dead.  If it's dead, you don't want to beat a dead horse, you look for other avenues of attack, like this one.  Nicely done.]
;W[er]
(;B[dp]C[This could've been better spent slipping into the corner. That would've helped even out the score, I think, and my group at the bottom would still be safe.

It's a possibility.  As it stands, I can't see the group at the bottom being safe.  I'm not saying there isn't a way, just I don't see it in my reading.]
;W[cq];B[bo];W[dd]SQ[pj][pm][qm][rm]C[I could've saved these stones, but I thought securing the group in the next move was the better idea.

The thing is, the group you're securing isn't that insecure.  You've got a wall followed by influence.  It's not safe, bu it's not under immediate threat.  Where did you think a threat would come from?  Maybe play it out.  Try the attack you feared would happen if you didn't move there and see if it would've been successful.]
;B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[mm]
(;B[nk]LB[nk:B][ml:A]C[Here, this move, as far as I can tell, could've been done at A without leaving you more vulnerable.  By placing it at B you cut into your potential territory unnecesssarily.  Walls are wonderful, you've got a nice one in the making, no reason not to finish that side off.]

This move isn't horrible.  A move at A would be a really bad move.  This move just could've been a little more aggressive.  Both of the alternatives you laid out are good and as you saw, they did what you wanted this move to do, but they did it better.]
;W[qh]
(;B[oi]C[This move is very defensive.  It's not a bad move, but it seems unnecessary right now.  You can push out and be a little more aggressive and then place this move later on.

In this instance, the end result was the same but if your opponent had wanted, they could have attacked in and reduced yoru territory more.]
(;W[ph];B[rh];W[rg];B[ri];W[sg];B[bq]SQ[ac][bc][ad][bd]C[This move feels too small.  It's a good move, but the the spot I marked feel like it's worth more.  You can secure more territory and it puts more pressure on your opponent.]

;W[os];B[ms]C[I mentioned this earlier, but here I think it really applies.  I'm not sure if you saw it, but this group is dead, so play elsewhere where you can still gain points.  If you didn't see that it was dead, then it makes perfect sense that you'd try to save it.  Doing more life and death scenarios will help you develop a feel for what's alive and what's dead.]

I feel like there was a cutting point or two somewhere I could've taken advantage of, but I couldn't see it. I think my playing in the bottom right early in the game was a really big mistake. My attack on the top right wasn't intended to kill, but maybe it should've been more aggressive nonetheless.

Thank you for taking a look at my game. Your comments and time are much appreciated.

If my commentary sounds very Day9ish (Starcraft 2 commentator) it's because I've been watching him a lot lately.  The only reason I bring that up, is one of the big prolems in SC2 for players is fear.  Since they can't see what their opponent is doing (fog of war), players often get scared of kinds of attacks they've seen before that killed them.  They get tunnel vision and blindly counter to keep themselves safe without knowing if that kind of attack is really coming.  

In your game, several times it seemed like you got this tunnel vision sort of approach to your play; this fearful, unnecessarily-defensive stance.  The beauty of Go is that there is no "fog of war'. You can see EVERYTHING your opponent is doing.  It's all on the board, right there in front of your eyes.  As you play more and learn more, you start to build a guidebook in your head that'll help you distinguish between a real threat and a fake threat.  Try not  to play with what could happen, play with what is happening.  I'm not saying don't look ahead but don't play a perfect counter against a tactic that needs 5 moves to get set up.

also, afterwards, if there was a time that you were really afraid of an attack on a group of stones; remember it and after the game, play it out.  It can help a lot to turn that fear into reality; was it really that scary?  Did I really need a stone there?   These questions can be answered when you play it out and then you dont' have to wonder; you know.

I apologize for being slightly out of shape with go, I hope I was still able to provide you with some useful information.  Again, if you have any more questions, comments, or if you ever want to play, don't hesitate to send me an email.

If you keep playing like this, remain diligent, and analyze yourself as seem to be doing, I think you'll be surprised at how quickly you improve.  

Best,

For starters, White may also have gone A,B,or C instead of trying to leap into your wall.  In the early game like this, you're looking for the moves that will get you the most influence and playing at 1, gets you very little as to what ABC could get you.  I'm not trying to say it was wrong to play out the variations were white attacks your wall, but as a general rule of thumb for your own future play, sometimes you have to go around the backside if you want to get into the castle.
