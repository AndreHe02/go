C[Hi, I am usagi5 2dan and I'll review your game for you. Hopefully I will be able to point out things that will be helpful to you. Feel free to write back to me if there are questions you still have!


Note: I have also included comments for white, because I think they will be beneficial.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[qc];B[iq]
(;W[qj]LB[dj:A][qn:B]C[Question: How can i attack right side ? Should i attack now ?


Black has played the chinese opening. This means he is trying to create a moyo. Next up, black would like "A" and also "B" because that would force white to invade, which is what black wants. In view of this, the left side and the lower right corner are big. There are several things you can do. The game move is not at all a bad one.]
;B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[cd];B[cj]LB[dj:A][di:B]C[Question: Is it good move ?

Black does need to defend the cut. This is a standard move to make. However, combined with 3 this move seems a little flat. Black could try something like "A" or "B", which would contribute more to the overall moyo strategy.]
;W[ic];B[pd]C[This is the correct idea, flattening out white's position.]
;W[qd];B[pe]
(;W[qn]C[White normally continues the joseki with "A" (see variation). Black can punish if he gets time after defending his corner.]
(;B[np];W[qq];B[qp]C[Question: Is Q3 better than this ?


No, R4 is the only move.
Playing R4 does not mean you have to play as in the game. Q3 takes the left and gives white the corner and right side. R4 still leaves you with this choice but also gives you the option to take the outside if you want.]
;W[rp]C[This is the only response. Here, black has two choices: "A" and "B".]
(;B[ro]C[This is also an option.];W[rq];B[qo];W[or]
(;B[pq]C[This move helps white live.];W[pr];B[nq];W[ep]
(;B[dn]C[Question: Is there any better move ?

Yes. Black is very, very strong around this area. Therefore, you can attack very, very severely.]
;W[cq]C[White lives too easily this way.];B[bq];W[dq]
(;B[co]LB[br:A]C[Black certainly has to protect his thinness, but this move still lets white play "A" in sente.]
;W[br];B[nr]C[This move is small, unless your idea was to threaten the corner. If you had read that you could kill, then it is a good sente move.]
;W[qf]LB[ob:A][rf:B]C[This is big, though better at "A" or "B".]
;B[kc];W[je];B[ld];W[eg];B[dh];W[dl]C[This is dangerous for white.]
(;B[cl]C[Black is strong enough in the area that defending isn't necessary. Black can attack.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[en];B[ej]LB[eo:A][em:B]C[Getting out is important. In this case, cutting at "A" or "B" would also be good.]
;W[nj]C[This is not a good move for white. It serves no direct purpose. White needs more stones in the area before a move like this would make territory.]
(;B[oc]C[Black should make some forcing moves before defending.]
;W[hq]
(;B[ir]LB[ip:A][hp:B]C[The outside with "A" or even "B" is better here.]
(;W[hr]C[White would get more taking the outside here.];B[ip]

(;B[lp];W[ql]
(;B[rs]C[Question: Is there a way for kill this group ?

I don't believe so.]
(;W[rr]LB[qs:A]C[This is wrong. It should be at "A". This gives black a chance at killing.]

(;B[hs];W[gs];B[is];W[fr]
(;B[ok]C[Question: What is the best way for reduce his area in this situation ?

This is probably on the deep side. Black is not doing badly on territory, so a deep reduction is not needed.]
;W[nk]C[This stone becomes swallowed up by the white stones.]
;B[oi]C[It ends up as a sacrifice. 83 is good to play without the 81 sacrifice.]
;W[oj];B[pf];W[qg]C[This is as in the earlier variation only 81 and 82 are here.]
;B[pg];W[qh]
(;B[lg]C[Question: I think my move is very bad :P What should i do instead of M13 ?


This move is not bad at all. It's true that there are some moves that could make a little more territory, but it is the right idea.]
;W[jg];B[ec]LB[ib:A][bd:B]C[This is an overplay. "A" and "B" are better reductions.]
;W[fc];B[de]
(;W[ee]C[This is a mistake. This lets black reduce white as in the game.]

(;B[hc];W[hd];B[fi];W[hg]LB[ga:A][gh:B]C[The atari at "A" is sente. 108 is a little defensive. It could be at "B".]
;B[ii]LB[em:A][bd:B][pb:C]C[I often play this kind of move too, but it is not good. This move looks like it is important since it keeps white from playing there and making "more territory" but it is actually too small.

Hopefully my review was helpful. Remember to work on tsumego and play lots of games! That probably goes without saying.
