C[humuhumu [2k\]: hi
yoshiharu [2k\]: hi
humuhumu [2k\]: good game


Dear reviewer,
thank you very much in advance for the review. I am humuhumu [2k\] playing white.
I am especially interested in the beginning untill half way of the middle game, let's say around move #100.
(After that, time became a little short and I was lucky at several points.)
Maybe you can tell me something about general principles and ideas behind the moves that are not good and the ones that would have been better in those situations.
Kind regards,
humuhumu

Hi! Here, a little late (sorry about that), the review of your game. It's a very complicated game, so I was not sure at many points how to comment, but hopefully my remarks are of some value for you nonetheless :)]
;B[qc]C[yoshiharu [2k\]: you too];W[dc];B[dp];W[qp];B[jj];W[ce]

;B[qq]
(;W[qm];B[rp];W[qo];B[ic];W[ol]C[Is this move too slow? It connects but the Q6 stones still have some aji, I guess.

-----------------

Connecting stones can't be bad :) In fact, I think Black should have pulled out these stones instead of playing elsewhere...]
;B[qf];W[gc]LB[cn:A]TR[kc]C[This move is a bit small but it gives the possibility to play L17 later and it is a good extension from the shimari.

----------------

Not a good idea in my opinion. I would prefer to play at A.

If a move needs another one to be good - what is left if the opponent prevents that second move?! Right - a bad move ;)]
;B[he]LB[ld:B][cj:A]C[Bad shape from Black. A or B seem to make more sense to me.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[ck]LB[hd:E][dh:A][dj:B][en:D][cq:C]C[Did you have a special reason for playing here? I don't like it too much, because it gives you only one continuation (A) - but of course, I am not strong enough to know what's best here :) Anyway, I would prefer B. After that, you can  continue at C or D, and even  the cut starting with E looks more dangerous to Black.]
;B[oj];W[qj]C[Nice! For me, too, Blacks moyo is too wide to be really dangerous.]
;B[jp];W[hq]LB[dh:C][bp:A][cq:B]C[I am not sure about this one...  the lower side doesn't look that important. By playing WA, BB, WC you can make more territory at the left than you destroy at the bottom.]
;B[io];W[fp];B[gp]LB[eq:A]C[Isn't A better?];W[gq];B[eq];W[hp]
;B[qi];W[rj]C[This way, White has been forced. Was there anything wrong with A?]
;B[go];W[ho];B[hn];W[gn];B[fo];W[in];B[hm];W[jq];B[jn];W[kq]
;B[pi];W[kk];B[kj];W[lk];B[im];W[kc]C[Good point!];B[mc]
(;W[id];B[jd];W[jc];B[ie];W[ib]LB[hd:A]C[Why? I don't think Black has a good move after WA]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[kd];W[lc];B[ld];W[mb];B[nc];W[mi]LB[lj:B][nk:A]
C[That leaves a terrible weakness at A. Again, I would play at the left side. Black can't gain as much with a move at B or so.]
;B[dj];W[cj];B[ci]C[Black tries to hard here.];W[di];B[dh];W[ei]
;B[ch];W[eh];B[eg]
(;W[ek]C[Good.];B[df];W[gf]LB[bp:A]C[Dangerous. A is very big.]
;B[fg]
(;W[hg]C[Oh, oh... Self destruction?!];B[fe];W[ed];B[fh];W[ej]
;B[lh]LB[gj:A]C[BA instead would have been good for Black.]
;W[hi];B[gj];W[hj];B[hk];W[ik];B[gk];W[jk];B[ij];W[li];B[kh]
C[Black should have played K12.

-----------

Sure :)];W[ki];B[ji];W[jh];B[ih];W[jg];B[hh];W[lj];B[fc];W[fd]
;B[gd];W[gb];B[bp]C[Finally ;)];W[bo];B[ro];W[qn];B[nl];W[nm]
;B[ok];W[pl];B[ml];W[ne]C[Again, White is tryinf to hard.];B[mg]
;W[ng];B[mf];W[oh];B[mh];W[ni];B[mm]LB[ii:A]C[Again, Black answers wrong. Why not connecting at A?]
;W[mn]LB[gi:A][nn:B][on:C]C[Ok, but A is simple and safe. (You can answer BB with WC then)]
;B[gi];W[ii];B[jj]C[Sorry, but this doesn't work :)];W[lm];B[ln]
;W[km]LB[nk:A]C[Cutting at A was possible.

After this, the game is one confusing mess, so I will end my commentary here ;)

This was an interesting game: I think you underestimated the value of the left side during the whole fuseki, maybe you could have had a much easier game by playing there...

Good luck with your next games :)];B[mo];W[nn];B[lo];W[kn];B[ko]

Looks quite bad for White in my eyes :)]))
