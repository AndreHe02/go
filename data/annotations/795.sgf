C[Commented for "mortenof" (M), playing white, and the GTL by Erik Ekholm, Swedish 2 dan. March 1999.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qe];W[jd];B[cj];W[cn];B[cg];W[fd]
;B[cc]LB[jp:a]C[M: After this, I feel maybe F16 wasn't so good... But I have no idea what I could've done

differently



EE: F16 was fine. C17 feels premature. Locally black B16 is the standard move, but a move like K4 (a) looks bigger.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf]TR[cg]C[EE: This gives White a lot better shape and less aji than if the marked black stone had been at C14 and White had been forced to connect at C15. That's why the 3-3 invasion isn't played so much with this kakari, as with the one one space closer.]
;B[eb];W[fb]LB[cl:a][dg:b][nq:c][jp:d]C[EE: This could wait, since you risk losing sente and the top isn't very big at this stage. The moves 'a' or 'b' for attack or the simple big points 'c' or 'd' seems better.]
;B[ec];W[fc];B[ed];W[ee];B[fe];W[ef];B[dc];W[gf]C[This move leaves lots of aji...



EE: Yes, but you have to play it.];B[lc];W[nq];B[kp];W[nn]LB[no:a]
C[EE: The 2-point jump is a bit thin. 'a' is safer.];B[pn];W[kn]
;B[gq]C[EE: "Corner, side, centre." White took a vague point in the centre, and gave Black the more valuable side.]
;W[dr]LB[cl:a]C[EE: A bit passive. 'a' may look small, but it presses Black towards the White thickness above, so it looks good.]
;B[go];W[pr]C[EE: You lose the chance to invade at 3-3 later.]
;B[qq];W[mo]C[This is maybe to slow, but seems neccesary.



EE: ... due to White's thin moves earlier. Still, it looks like shape.]
;B[qj];W[ql]TR[kn][mo][nn][nq]C[At this point I'm definitly behind, so my strategy is to try to break up black's territory



EE: Good judgement. This way, your recent reinforcement is used actively..]
;B[qm];W[pl];B[oj];W[om];B[qr];W[oe]C[EE: Yet a good move.]
;B[pg];W[oc];B[pd];W[od];B[me];W[nf]LB[og:a]C[EE: 'a' might be faster.]
;B[mf];W[ng];B[mg];W[nh];B[mk];W[mh];B[lh];W[li];B[kh];W[mj]
;B[lk];W[ki];B[jh];W[ji];B[ih]C[I think my opponent would've been better off playing L14...



EE: Hard to say. Poking the head out is also valuable.];W[kf]
;B[lg];W[nk]C[This cut safeties my group...];B[jk];W[pi]C[EE: Excellent timing before connecting at O10. A dan move.]
;B[nj]C[This move is a mistake on my opponents part...];W[pj]
C[EE: Very efficient for White.];B[lm];W[ln];B[nl];W[ok];B[ol]
;W[pk];B[pm];W[ml];B[ll];W[mm]C[Now my groups are linked and he has a weak group in the centre...]
;B[qi];W[qh]TR[go][gq][kp][lm][ll][lk][mk][jk][ih][jh][kh][lh]
[mf][mg][lg][me][lc][cg][cj]LB[cl:a][kb:b][ii:c]C[This cut seems to have been an overplay and not very urgent either...



EE: Right. Black has four more or less weak groups (marked) that you should torment while grabbing profit. 'a', 'b' and around 'c' are all attractive choices.]
;B[rh];W[qf];B[pf];W[pe];B[qd];W[ph];B[qg];W[hi]C[M: A splitting attack]
;B[ie]C[M: This is a good answer, utilizing the aji of the F15 stone]
;W[hd];B[id];W[il]C[This is definitly overplay, maybe J7 is better threatening the group below?



EE: It is too small in scale.];B[ik];W[hk];B[hl];W[im];B[hj]
;W[ii]C[EE: This is not important, as Black's group above is strong after J16.]
;B[gk]C[This is very bad for me...



EE: Yes. You played the last few moves to attack this group, and now he made a ponnuki, which makes his group strong. Thereby your moves were wasted.]
;W[ej]C[This should've been C8, as this point is worthless (I thought I could continue my attack on the centre group...)



EE: Yes.];B[cl];W[el]LB[kr:a]C[Another worthless point



EE: 'a' seems like a good alternative.];B[hm];W[bi];B[ci];W[bh]
;B[bj];W[bg];B[dm];W[if]C[This attack seems quite severe...



EE: Black has enough space to make eyes towards the edge if he needs to.]
;B[je];W[jf];B[he];W[ge];B[hf];W[hg];B[ig]LB[ic:a]C[EE: 'a' takes territory and life, and avoids the squeeze.]
;W[ic]C[EE: Good!];B[ke];W[kd];B[le];W[jc];B[hh];W[ld];B[md]
;W[mc]LB[ob:a][qb:b]C[EE: A better way to play here (when the time is right) is to play 'a', which makes 'b' and N17 miai.]
;B[nc];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb];B[ob]C[But black  escapes... I managed to take some profit along the upper side though..



EE: But Black secured a few points around Q18 as well.];W[rg]
C[This sequence is too small... And ends in in gote. The lower side seems a better place

to play



EE: Agree.];B[rf];W[ri];B[sg];W[rj];B[eh];W[fh]C[M: F11 would've been better]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[ei];W[fg];B[nd];W[fn];B[em];W[gn];B[hn];W[ho]
;B[hp];W[io];B[ip];W[kr]C[Maybe K5 first to keep the black groups separated?



EE: L2 is big. The sequence from G6 to J5 was unnecessary.]
;B[lq];W[jq];B[jp];W[lr];B[eq];W[dq];B[jo];W[kl];B[in];W[kk]
;B[en];W[ep];B[fp];W[er];B[fq];W[rm]LB[bm:a]C[This is too small, but black answers so it doesn't end in gote



EE: 'a' is probably the biggest move.];B[rn];W[rl]
(;B[ro]LB[bm:a]C[This seems unneccesary



EE: Well, it protects against the clamp (see var) but   'a' is of course bigger.]
;W[or];B[co]C[very severe. I should've defended at B6 much earlier



EE: No so severe, I think. See variation 3!]

;W[ao];B[cm];W[an];B[cn]C[Black would've been better off not playing B2 I think...



EE: Possibly, even though it retains some aji.];W[qs];B[rs]
;W[ps];B[rr];W[ad];B[ac];W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[cb];W[mq];B[fs]
;W[es];B[cr];W[bq];B[ar];W[cs];B[gs];W[aq];B[bl];W[bs];B[am]
;W[ch]C[M: This is a trick play, B should just D12 and give up his stone... I would end in gote..]

(;B[dg]LB[de:a]C[But he falls right into the trap...



EE: Clever of you. :-) Some of its value should be deducted though, since it gives Black the point 'a' later.]
;W[di];B[dh];W[fj];B[dj];W[gj];B[fl];W[dk];B[ck]C[EE: Very small.]
;W[oo];B[po];W[lp]C[EE: Loses sente.];B[kq];W[ir];B[de]C[EE: Oh, very big. :-(]
;W[df];B[ce];W[eg];B[di];W[ae];B[ap];W[ao];B[an];W[ma]C[K8 would've been much better, even T6 is bigger then this...



EE: K8 is bigger, but T6 is of about equal value, since if you play O19, P19 will be your sente, so besides securing M19, you will on average make a one point incursion into Black's territory, making N19 a two point gote move, just as T6.]
;B[ap];W[cq];B[eo];W[as];B[jm];W[km];B[jl];W[jj]C[Only 1 point gote...



EE: Since Black K10 would have a sente followup (L10), this is actually 2 point in gote or one point in reverse sente.]
;B[iq];W[jr];B[op];W[np];B[on];W[no]C[EE: This is just a ko of one point. It should be left until last.]
;B[fk];W[ek];B[hr];W[is];B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[og];B[ko];W[lo]
;B[ai]C[M: This is 2 points gote.. bigger than many of my plays have been...



EE: Even though the margin of wictory was only 6.5 points, this game wasn't decided in the endgame, since both players did endgame mistakes of comparable sizes. I feel that after Black secured his weak groups around move 107, he took the lead, and after that, White never really caught up.]
;W[ah];B[aj];W[oq]C[1 point gote again... T6 is 2 points
