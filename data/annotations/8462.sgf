AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS reviewing your game.

I will try to answer your questions and also give my opinion in cases I feel it's needed.

My comments will start with W:];W[dd];B[pq];W[po]
(;B[oo];W[on]
(;B[no];W[nn];B[mo];W[pp];B[oq];W[op]C[what about this move, is it ok?

W: The problem here is that before this push, your two stones had 4 liberties.

When Black blocks, your stones only have 3 liberties, and a cut will be very severe.]
;B[np];W[qq]C[White group status: 3 separate groups.]
(;B[qm];W[qn]C[W: Black peeping here was a mistake. Instead of 3 separate groups, you now have one connected strong group.

White group status: Unbreakable. I hope you can see the difference now. : )]
;B[pm];W[pn];B[pg];W[qr];B[nq];W[jp]C[too early?

W: Not at all. If you had waited, Black would've protected this group. You have to take the initiative to attack a weak group if you don't have weak groups on the board.]
;B[kq];W[jq];B[kr];W[jr];B[kp];W[ko]
(;B[fq]C[i think this should be n6 or k5?

W: Not necessarily. If Black cuts at K5, you can defend by playing in this area. By taking care of this first, Black now THREATENS the k5. Instead of attacking, threatening to attack can also be good. I like Black's plan here.]
;W[mn];B[pr]
(;W[ln]C[L7 instead of M6 better?];B[pj];W[dn]TR[bo][bp][cp]
[cq]C[W: What about the marked invasions instead? You are strong at the bottom side of the board, stealing the corner from Black would make his corner group vulnerable.]
(;B[cf];W[dh]C[W: When White plays this move, he threatens D14 which is such a powerful move black should actually jump out.]
(;B[fc];W[df]C[is d14 right, strategically seen?

W: In this shape, D14 is always correct. No other moves should be considered. : )]
;B[db];W[ce]
(;B[ic]
(;W[nc]C[W: If you play from the outside, Black will get time to make the whole right side and upper right corner certain territory for him.]
(;B[pc];W[kc];B[ie]
(;W[jb];B[ib]C[j18 too passive?

W: Not only does this move strenghten the top group and take territory, it also attacks the White group next to it. When a move does a lot of things, it surely can not be too passive.]
;W[ig]C[W: This could turn out to be a dangerous overplay. The white group at the top is not completely safe, and White is forcing Black to move towards it. Eventually White will need to come back to protect the weak group, and Black will get the initiative.]
(;B[jf];W[jg]
(;B[mj];W[kj]
(;B[lo]C[m5 is not good in my opinion, better c9?]
(;W[jn];B[gn];W[go];B[fo];W[fn];B[en];W[fm];B[eo];W[em]
(;B[cn];W[cm];B[bn];W[bm]C[W: Now the three white stones are connected, and have 8 liberties. Something must've turned out silly!]

W: Yes, but not yet. Black should cut first, as it threatens to capture the 4 stones.]

For White: It's good to have a bunch of fighting spirit, but in this game Black didn't see your weaknesses. In all fights your groups lost liberties, and some times you got punished. Try to avoid losing liberties, by making pushing moves such as P4, and letting Black push you around around J11.

I hope this helped, feel free to send any questions you might still have to lauri.vihavainen@gmail.com]
