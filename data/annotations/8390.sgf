Hello, this is Bernd from Germany, HonFu here in the GTL and in other go places. So let's see what we got here!]

(;B[qr]
(;W[mp]C[Hon: In most cases peeping like this is a waste because you solidify the opponent.]
(;B[mn]C[the opening was somewhat creative for us... don't know if black should connect here...

Hon: In most cases you connect.];W[np]C[Hon: Now black is separated into two groups and has to defend his corner. Afterwards things will get messy.

If black had just connected, he would have less trouble, having only one group to deal with.]
;B[mr]
(;W[ko]C[Hon: This is an interesting move, but I think that after black has defended, white still has a weakish group. If he has to play something around m2 anyway, then he can as well do it from the start.]
;B[ml];W[ol];B[dj];W[jd];B[fc];W[nc];B[qf];W[cl]C[Hon: Locally this move looks like a normal option, but white is quite thin in the lower left quarter of the board, so he might be inviting trouble.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
(;W[co]
(;B[kq]TR[mp]C[Hon: Double keima is not good in this case, because the marked stone is there.

(Also black normally has to push at f2 once so that white can not play in sente there and make profit for free.)]
(;W[ch];B[ci]
(;W[pb]C[Hon: Leaving the C12-Invasion in distress looks strange.]
(;B[qc];W[kp]C[Hon: Black says thanks.]
(;B[jq];W[eh];B[bh];W[cg];B[el]C[Hon: This looks dangerous. Before you play a keima like this ...]
(;W[fr];B[dr];W[km];B[mj];W[oj];B[kk];W[il]C[Hon: You must be very careful with this kind of moves.]
(;B[en]C[Hon: Risky.]
(;W[ij];B[lg];W[qh]C[could imagine to cut immediately at c4 but r13 looks to be answered now too

Hon: This stone makes bad shape with P10, as white finds out one move later.

Looking just from the result, it might have lost white the game, since black destroys almost all of this. You always got to look that your own stones cooperate. If you play a move like this, you got to be prepared for Q11 and have an answer ready.]
;B[pi];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri]C[Hon: In the end white has only helped black get a few points.]
;W[eo];B[fi];W[gg];B[bg]C[b thinks to have to connect here...

Hon: I can understand the feeling, since the group is isolate between white's stones.]

(;W[ce];B[be];W[dd];B[dc];W[cc];B[bd];W[ec];B[db];W[ed];B[eb]
C[Hon: With this sequence white has just helped black solidifying the corner.]
;W[gb];B[fb];W[lq];B[lr];W[me];B[pk]C[following sequence seems to be an overplay by b. at least thats what we agreed...]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[hm];B[rk];W[sj];B[ok];W[nk];B[nj];W[qk];B[pl]
C[can white play q9 now?

Hon: You mean Q7? Does not seem to work.]
(;W[ql];B[pm];W[qm];B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[pn];B[mk];W[ei];B[ej]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[nf];B[fh];W[ge];B[eg];W[ef];B[dh];W[kf];B[hd]
C[overplay again...

Hon: You have to read out what happens to the stone after the next few moves.

I stop here for now. In this review I rather looked locally at what was there instead of watching out for a "topic", but if I had to choose one in hindsight, then there have been a lot of cases where both players played shapes with bad aji, probably without really being aware of the opportunities and peril that were lying in wait. If the awareness for these kind of "soft spots" has increased a little now, then I will be happy.

I recommend going over the shapes here a few more times. In your next games watch out if they occur and then look for a way to exploit them.]

Playing as white did in the game just played away a lot of possibilities although there was no clear need to do so. Only play a move if it is necessary or biggest!]
))
(;W[ek]C[Hon: I wonder if the players were aware of this here.

Maybe this move does not work immediately, but especially in a position like this with many weakish groups on the run, you can hardly predict how the board will look twenty moves later. Suddenly this weakness might be the game decisive factor.]
))
(;B[jm];W[jl];B[kl];W[jn]C[Hon: The ladder works now, but for how long?]
)
(;B[jl];W[jm];B[im]C[Hon: This possibility also remains.])
(;B[jn]C[Hon: Also black might prepare the cut with a move like this. It can be tricky ...]
;W[lm]C[Hon: If white answers like this, but you got to be aware of all these possibilities. And even if a move seems to work now, since in go you have to leave stones, once put, where they are, leaving a weakness might become decisive later in the game.]

(;W[ek]C[Hon: ... you always have to think first if you can handle this answer.]

(;B[lq]C[Hon: Here, repairing the chink.]))
(;B[dh]C[Hon: It is a bit hard to say clearly which is better, but normally you don't just take local losses like this one, where white is almost paralyzed.

If white has just played Q18 without C12 first, then black strengthened his upper left one way or another, then it would be still easier to do something there as if you solidify him like this.]
))

;B[cj];W[ej]C[Hon: ... white gets very good shape.])
(;B[fi]C[Hon: If black answers, for example like this (or one point below if the keima is too dangerous), then white can handle his stones flexibly.]
)))
(;W[lr]C[Hon: White can aim at this.];B[lq];W[nr];B[nq];W[mq]
TR[mp]C[Hon: You can see that the marked stone becomes vital.]
)
(;W[nr]C[Hon: From this side does not work so well in this case, but in principle you'd have to watch out for this too.]
;B[nq];W[lr];B[mq]C[Hon: White has trouble answering this.]
))
(;B[lq]C[Hon: If you get out, it has to be this move most of the times. It is not a marvellous result, but the ignoring of the peep has to be blamed for that.]
))
(;W[cn]C[Hon: Here. Don't take bad shape when there is no reason to do so.]
))
(;W[lr]C[Hon: white should see if he can wall in black firmly.]
(;B[lq];W[nr];B[kr];W[or]C[Hon: Black maybe sacrifices the corner.]
)
(;B[nr];W[lq];B[rq]C[Hon: Or he lives, but then he lives small. Compared to the game white has more control over the lower side and the black stones in the center have a harder life.]
)))
(;B[np]C[Hon: After black has connected, his group can not be cut anymore and is out into the center. The white stone at N4 doesn't hold much of a meaning, just sticking at that wall like a bubble gum.

(But black has bad shape, so playing N4 instead of R2 was still better.)]
;W[mq]C[Hon: If white strenghens it ...];B[jp]C[Hon: ... then it comes unter attack and one might wonder who is attacking whom.]
))
(;W[tt]C[Hon: As long as black has that cutting point ...];B[tt]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[np]C[Hon: ... white can aim for some kind of action to exploit it.]
)
(;W[nn];B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[qf]C[Hon: Maybe something like this is better, but I am not sure, since pushing black down there also helps his shape and the hoshi stone at D4 doesn't like it.

(MIght be the joseki choice to blame for, which strengthens black's shape from the start, but that might also be a matter of taste.)]
)
(;W[lp]C[Hon: Maybe a move like this is better on the lower side, because it activates the cutting aji without strengthening black directly. If he plays N4 now, he just helps you.]
))
(;B[mp]C[Hon: Joseki book says, you should go here. White has got strong shape and black should get solidity as well. White is neutralizing the influence of the hoshi stone in the upper right, and black is doing the same with the white hoshi stone in the lower left. A play in the corner remains as a very large gote endgame for later.]
