C[P: Hey Thomas, my name's Peter. I'm 4k on kgs, where I play as petition. I can see why it would be hard to see exactly where you lost this game. It was very peaceful, with no real fighting, but in the end, black was behind by a considerable margin. The main things I'll be focussing on in this review are: how to build a moyo; using corner enclosures; and playing actively rather than passively.

In this review, all of my comments will be preceded by P:  When I include a variation on a move, I'll tell you in the comments. I use b as an abbreviation for black, and w for white. I use some japanese go terms. I only explain what they mean when I feel that it's important to analysing this game. All other terms you can find on sensei's library if they're unclear (senseis.xmp.net)

Alright! Let's go!];B[pc];W[dd]
(;B[pq]C[P: This is a pretty uncommon move for black. The most common moves are q4 and r4, but p4 is also a good move. The reason for this is something called Direction of play. 

A stone on the 3-4 point has two intentions. The first is creating an enclosure, like playing at r15. Once an enclosure is played, the direction of those two stones in the upper right would be along the top side, and a play around k16 would be ideal.
The second is to let w play an approach move around r15, then to pincer. It is that potential pincer stone you want to be thinking about. Check out the variation on this move.

Basically, b's two stones aren't working together well, making it  hard to build a moyo or to work effectively with a pincer stone. I'll elaborate more on why this is as we go on. Check out the sensei's page on direction of play, or you can read direction of play by takeo kajiwara ( i don't know how you feel about downloading stuff, but this is available on the pirate bay if you search 'go education collection').]
;W[dp]C[P: In contrast, the two 4-4 stones of w's are aiming to exand towards k4 and k16, which would greatly reduce the effectiveness of any black enclosures in building a moyo in those areas. It might seem silly to say, but b is already a bit behind.]
(;B[qn]C[P: Now, this enclosure is aiming towards k4, but it's w's turn to play, which means w can play first in the big area. therefore, i don't think this move is good for b, because it makes the bottom valuable, then gives it to w. check out the variation for another way to play.]
;W[qh]C[P: This is a bit of a vague move by w. It doesn't seem to have a purpose and it lets black play around r16 in sente. Perhaps w was afraid of b building a strong position on the right? But it would take b several more moves to secure anything here, which would be very slow, and even then that position would be quite flat with no potential for expanding, because of the direction of q3 and q17. This area of the board is not valuable right now. 

A general principal for the opening is to play in open space. Altho this space is 'open' it is less open that any of the three other sides, so it's not as efficient as it could be.]
;B[qf]C[P:  Good job exploiting w's weak move to make an enclosure in sente! That's the sort of thing that wins games. However, this move is too thin, meaning that it leaves behind too much bad aji/ weakness. Better to play tight at r15. As it is, w will play r9, becoming stable, while b is left with a bad weakness at r15 that could either cause the stones to be split or the corner to be lost.]
;W[qk]
(;B[dg]C[P: I think this is a bad move. Why play into w's side when you have the chance to expand your own area of influence o either the top or bottom? Once you've played an enclosure, like sither q3 and r6 or q17 and r14, the area in front of the enclosure is very big and must be played in. Consider the variation.]
;W[gc]C[P: bd13 also prompts w to extend onto the top, towards b's enclosure.]
;B[dm]C[9 and 11 too high ?

P: It's not that they're too high, but that they're unsupported. W can play into the middle and attack both of them while building strength on the top and bottom, which should be your areas. You're right though, they would be stronger on the third line, where it would be easier to build a base, or slide into the corner.]
;W[cj];B[fp]C[P: this is a very good move.]
(;W[cp]C[P: Hm, a  slow move. W needs to take initiative here because b is developing much more quickly. W must start to attack while b is still thin everywhere! Consider the variation.]
;B[ej]C[P: So far, w is playing too slow, and b is playing too fast. Black is playing for influence, obviously. But influence to what end? where is b trying to build a moyo? There is perhaps one taking shape on the bottom, but the black stones there are still weak. None of b's stones are working together well here. This stone perhaps does a little bit to allow d13 and d7 to work together, but the attack on the w stone is not severe. B needs to become more solid. one possibility for that is the contact play at c16. The extension to k4 is also good, and is consistent with building a moyo. 

e10 is not too bad. it's a good point to take at some point, once you know where your moyo is going to be. But right now, there are more important matters.]
;W[bm];B[iq]C[P: At this point. You want to be thinking about extending from your enclosure, not from the f4 stone. It may seem a subtle difference, but it's important to know where your most valuable areas are and how best to control them.

This extension is aiming for a moyo around h7. That is in fact the are b ends up with, and it is tiny compared to the area around n4, which w gets. I think it is in this area of the board that b loses the game. none of b's stones on the left side are controlling any territory, they are not thick, and they are not working effectively to build a moyo, while j3 makes it easy for w to invade the bottom.

k4 or l4 would be more appropriate here.];W[lq]C[P: W invades. So how to attack this stone? I believe the keima at k5 is not forceful enough. if the black j3 stone was at k4, you could play m4, but as it is, that would just strengthen w. 

See the variation on the next move.]
(;B[jo]C[P: This move doesn't put very much pressure on w, and it makes the moyo even more cramped than it needs to be.

see variaton.];W[lo]
(;B[kn]LB[nr:a]C[would a have been better ?

P: No, this is better than A. There's a proverb that says, play up before playing down. Chasing the group into the centre allows you to build strength, whereas A is merely small.

I put a variation on this move.];W[jc]C[P: Huge point. 

In a review I once got, the reviewer said, Each turn, ask yourself -- 

Do my groups have any weaknesses? If so, fix them.

Do my opponents groups have any weaknesses? If so, attack them.

If neither of those, then play the biggest point.


According to that, w doesn't feel that b's threat to the two w stones on the bottom is urgent, and would rather take the biggest point on the board. This is b's chance to punish w for the arrogance.]
;B[mc];W[cd]
(;B[ln]LB[lo:b][lq:a]C[is a better here ? Looking for a better way to treat a and b

P: See variation for some ideas.];W[or];B[pr]C[P: This response is too passive. it means w lives easily. see the variation on b's previous move for a more active route.

I'm not going to talk much about this struggle here, because I think the strategic concerns are more important, and that ability to fight is more tied to reading ability. My only suggestion is, during fights, try and anticipate your opponents move, how you will respond, how they will play, then how you will respond, before each move. This may seem like a lot, but it's really only the work of a few moments, and it is the key to becoming stronger.]

;W[kq];B[mo];W[mp];B[mn];W[jq];B[jp];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr]
(;B[pl]C[P: So -- this is a very important moment. As it stands, b is behind on territory, but has an enormous wall that dominates the board. How to use that wall? I think you had the right idea in trying to make w run somewhere, but there's a proverb that says

play away from thickness!

that means avoid playing close to your own walls. your stones will end up ineffecient and overconcentrated, and you reduce your own potential to make territory. This move is too close to the wall. See the variation for another idea.]
;W[ql];B[qm];W[pk];B[ol];W[ok];B[nk];W[oi]C[P: See how b's last three moves are too close to the existing wall? The territory between is painfully cramped, and w's group lives easily, cancelling out b's thickness and making the weakness at r15 more dangerous.]
;B[jj]C[P: again, this move it too close, and the resulting moyo is too cramped. In another variation, I showed a sequence for some forcing moves against the top w group to get a wall there, but if you want to play this way,  n11 is better.]
;W[eo]
(;B[fn]C[a better way to defend the mojo ?

P: if possible, it's best to avoid being in the position b is in. In order to even stand a chance in this game, b must hang onto most of the huge moyo carved out in the centre. this is a treat for w, a chance to take little bites here and there, as b has no choice but to passively defend, because they have put all their eggs in one basket. 

For this reason, strategically, it is good to focus on developing multiple areas, building  territories that have options for expanding or becoming the base of a moyo. 

Your strategy in this game, which you committed to early on, was to make one big moyo in the centre. In my opinion, it is almost impossible to win by doing this, and it makes the gamevery easy for your opponent. 

But here, to defend, it might be best to attack the left side. See the variation.]

;W[kf];B[lg];W[bg];B[bf]C[P: this move doesn't really do anything, and b ends in gote. there are some big points around still, like r1 is huge, and there's still an attack on  the w stones on the right to expand b's area.]

;W[sr];B[rp];W[lf];B[mg];W[mf]
(;B[ng]C[P: I'm not sure what the purpose of this move is. At this point, it's good to make a list in your head of all the biggest areas, then, starting with anything that's sente, play them as soon as you can.

Also, why not attack the r9 group? see variation.];W[nj];B[mk]

C[P: this move is too small. consider m18, e2, s8, b16, e16... this move is worth zero points, and if w doesn't respond to it, and b plays there again, it's worth only four points. w could get several times that much elsewhere.]
;W[lp];B[gr];W[hs]C[P: this is a bad move. w didnt need to respond to this locally, then once b plays h2, simply k1. w should have e2 instead.]
