RE[W+R]

C[Hi my name is Ronald Wopereis, woepwoep on KGS and IGS. I will review for black player. My comments preceded by : 

RW>];B[pj]C[RW> usually it makes sense for the first 25 moves or so, to play on 2nd or 3rd row/col. So R or S instead of Q column. Also it makes sense to start out in one of the corners, because then you can play two 2nd or 3rd rows/cols at one time. Go is about achieving more than one goal with only one move.]
;W[dd];B[dj];W[pd];B[pf];W[pp];B[np];W[dp];B[eo]C[I have two escape routes, e4 and d5

RW> white doesn't take notice of what black does. White understands that corners are most effective at the start of the game. The only thing white notices is that black does not occupy the corners. White considers the four corners to be top priority - anything else has less value. And so, because black does not play the corners, white is very happy. I doubt that white sees escape routes at all.]
;W[jp];B[io];W[jd];B[de];W[ce]C[RW> on white's priority list, after the establishment of presence at all four corners, the runner up is the sides. White managed to occupy two sides (upper and lower). This concludes the early stage of white's plan.

RW> the situation is this : black aims at getting the center area, while white aims at getting the area at the corners and the sides of the board.

RW> if we calculate the results from both plans, then white will have roughly (4 sides x 3 rows per side x 19 points per row) = 228 points. Black will have roughly (D15 - Q15 - Q4 - D4 square) =12x12 = 144 points. As you can see, this initial plan is a clear win for white.

RW> conclusion: the central space is not enough territory to win the game.]
;B[df];W[jj]C[RW> now white attacks the central space, thereby further decreasing the 144 points of black.]
;B[be]C[is b 15 to far out?

RW> this is the first move by black to leave the original plan of occupying the centre area. In GO, one can not win without a plan.]
;W[bd]C[she protects and attacks at the same time?!?

RW> yes, see my earlier remarks on the goal of GO - to achieve multiple goals with one single move.]
;B[cf]C[so i do the same :)];W[cd];B[ed]C[RW> A14 or B13 required here.]
;W[bf]C[so now b 15 is toast. Is there a way to still keep it alive?

RW> no, but you can defend the left side by playing B13. See var(iation).]

(;B[ae];W[af];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[fq];B[gq]C[i thought that this stone would be dead and that she would play g4 but she didn't. Would g4 be a good move for her?

RW> white playing g4 is not optimal. increasing the territory from the corner base is much better. D5 is excellent play !]
;W[do];B[dn];W[gr];B[hq]C[should i have connected at g4 instead?

RW> no this is just fine.];W[jr];B[hr];W[fr];B[hs];W[gs]C[when an opponent makes a wall like this, is it better to stay with the attack or should I attack somewhere else?

RW> note that black and white are both creating a wall. This happens a lot. So the question for black is ; how do i profit from the wall H1/H2/H3/G3/F4/E4/D6 ?]
;B[co];W[cp]C[how does she keep attack and defending at the same time???

RW> this is not attack, this is purely defense. Notice how white is pushed back into the lower left corner.]
;B[cn]C[RW> good move black !];W[dr]C[at this point i realize that she has opportunities to make eyes. Is there anyway to stop it?

RW> let her be. the space that white has won in this lower left corner, is decreased by one point each and every time she throws in a stone there.]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[bo]C[RW> excellent. black is pushing white territory to almost zero points.]
;W[ch]C[I'm not sure if this was a good move or not

RW> black can not save B15. If he plays B13, then white A16.]
;B[aq];W[ar]
(;B[br]C[I didn't see that she could have attacked. How could i have protected myself?

RW> a great move instead of B2 would be C3. See var.];W[ap]
C[Is there anyway to protect b2.

RW> yes C3. see variation on next move.]
(;B[as];W[aq]
(;B[bs]C[RW> black to play C3 instead of B1. See var.];W[cr]
C[Now I realize how my previous move was bad. per hams i should have moved at a5 instead?

RW> yes A5 better than B1/B2];B[cq]C[I thought she would protect at a5 but she didn't.]
;W[cs]C[;.(];B[bg]C[then i saw how stupid that move was.];W[ad]

(;B[dh]C[RW> instead of D12, black can play D3 and win the white group at D4. See var.]
;W[cg]C[its d5 liberty is taken right,

RW> yes i understand, but it is not correct. Black is free to play d3 and win the white d5 group !]
;B[bh]C[so i attacked and defended at the same time.];W[bi]
;B[ci]C[finally i get a break. lol

RW> excellent play !];W[dq];B[dg];W[ec];B[ee];W[fd];B[ai];W[fe]

RW> excellent play !];W[pm];B[jn];W[ip];B[hp];W[qh];B[ph];W[qf]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[pg]C[i didn't see any better move.

RW> good move.];W[qi];B[qj]C[R11's Q11 liberty is virtually taken right?

RW> yes excellent move !];W[qe];B[ri];W[rh];B[sj];W[rf];B[sh]
C[i tried making eyes on the side so that i could commence the attack.

RW> best is not to play row/col #1 unless you have to. In this case Q11 much better for black.]
;W[sg];B[si];W[sk];B[rj];W[rk];B[pi];W[qk];B[pe]C[Now i have to go the long way around.

RW> impossible. see white's next move R16.];W[qd];B[od];W[oc]
;B[nc]C[i thought that i could protect myself and attack at the same time with this move.

RW> what is missing here is a plan. Moves like these are re-actions, not actions. Re-actions are the signature of any beginner in go play (including yours truly :-)]
;W[nd];B[oe]C[RW> right choice !];W[mc]C[is this stone dead already? I can't think of a way to protect it

RW> yes, theoretically, since it is completely surrounded and can't make two eyes. But white gives black an opportunity to black shortly after. See next moves.]
;B[nb];W[ob]
(;B[oa]C[RW> black N16 gives relief. See var.];W[pa];B[mb];W[na]
C[well i had to give one up for something else]
(;B[lc]C[RW> consider N16 instead of M17];W[md];B[ld];W[me]

;W[ka];B[le];W[lf];B[nf];W[kf];B[ne];W[jb];B[kc];W[jc];B[je]
;W[ke]C[was there a way to protect this group?

RW> not after the white play of N16.];B[nb]C[I thought that if you take the center and stop their ability to make an eye, then you capture their stones. What happened?

RW> black O18 is not a threat to white, because if black plays subsequent N18 or O17 then white will play the other move (O17 or N18) and kill black before black kills white. This means white has two eyes already (N18 and O17)]
;W[kd];B[jf];W[jg];B[if];W[hg];B[fi];W[gi];B[gh];W[gg];B[hh]
C[the hunter becomes the hunted ;.(

RW> yes, white blocks the black group at K14 from connecting.]

(;B[gk];W[ij]C[if i played j9 here, would i have had a chance to take h9?

RW> no. see var on previous move.];B[ao];W[ii]C[ouch];B[fk]
;W[gl];B[ek];W[fl]
(;B[dk]C[RW> here E8 instead of D9, see var.];W[el]
(;B[ag]C[RW> black must stop white by playing D8. Urgent move. See var.]
;W[en];B[em]C[potential kill?

RW> yes, another one of white's cutting moves. E5 group is now in danger of being killed.]
;W[fn];B[fm]
(;W[gm]C[how did he turn it completely around?

RW> white F5 instead of G7 and black F4 group is dead. See var.]
;B[dm];W[gn];B[dl]C[connect to protect

RW> yes very good move.];W[ho];B[hn]C[i should of protected

RW> black F4 group has not two eyes and no way of connecting to living groups. F4 group is dead.]
;W[in];B[hm];W[im]C[is there anyway to save this group of stones?

RW> not any more. See variations earlier in the game.];B[go]
;W[hl]
(;B[mg]C[RW> to create two eyes, black must "jump off the wall" and play O11 instead of N13. See var.]
;W[mi];B[lg];W[nh];B[ng];W[ok]C[what was the point of this move?

RW> previous move white O12 probably killed the black group of O14. The current move P9 is to keep the other stones N11 and O12 in place.]
;B[oh];W[ni]C[now i realize this entire group (m9 and everything it's connected to) is dead. I couldn't make any eyes right?

RW> some moves ago yes. at this point not any more.];B[mh];W[li]
;B[ki];W[kj];B[kh]C[would m12 be a better move?

RW> neither move brings two eyes (life) back into this group.]
;W[lh];B[kg];W[lm];B[nj];W[lj];B[nk];W[oj];B[oi];W[pk];B[ol]
;W[pl];B[om]C[at this point i know that i've lost.

RW> look at the prediction somewhere at the beginning of the game. White has indeed managed to occupy all corners, and it is therefore impossible for black to win the game.]
;W[on];B[ln];W[mn];B[km];W[kl]C[was there a way to protect that group?

RW> I am sorry no there was no way. A group has two ways of survival when surrounded by an enemy group. One way is to reconnect to other groups that are alive; the other way is to make two eyes. Neither option is available to this here black group.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[qn];W[qo];B[ro];W[rp];B[rq]C[doomed, ( how come i see it easier after the game?)

RW> yes :-)  as in life, stress is the #1 creativity killer.]
;W[qq];B[sp];W[qp];B[sn]C[trying to make eyes here];W[pn];B[sr]
;W[rr];B[sq];W[qm];B[rm];W[rn]C[all hope for eyes are lost]
;B[sm];W[so];B[rs];W[ss]C[slamster1 has resigned the game.

RW> conclusion: black has executed a plan that can never lead to victory. Black should consider a different plan : first the corners, then the sides of the board, and leave the opponent to engage in the center of the board. This is the lesson that white has taught black. Perhaps next time black can teach this same lesson to someone else ?

RW> For black there is the best advice to share in the joy of white, because you have made someone happy. Enjoy further play, all go players have played games like this one. Consider this to be a step upwards to the next level (kyu). Best regards, Ron]
