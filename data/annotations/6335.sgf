C[Thanks for the review! =D

I am palleon86. I played black this game. I lost by about 15 points.

I've already reviewed the game by myself. There are already many comments and a few questions. My main concern is that the commented moves. Please let me know what you think of the comments. Do they show the correct thought process or do I have the wrong approach? If you want to comment on anything else that you see, however, feel free!

Hi Palleon! I am NannyOgg on KGS, about 1d AGA in strength, and will review to the best of my ability. After I reviewed your game, my teacher minue622 (7d on KGS) went over it with me, and showed me moves I had missed and mistakes I made. Hope this will help you.]

Nanny: Here it is better for black to play A or B. They are dual purpose move. An extension from b's corner and a pincer.]
;B[nc]LB[nc:A]C[Nanny: So pincer instead of A];W[rd]LB[qg:B]
[qh:A]C[Even at this point in the game, should still play A or B]

(;B[qc];W[qi];B[qk]C[Is this too far?

Nanny: No, that looks fine to me locally.]
(;W[qm]LB[qm:A]C[Nanny: A feels hasty for white
Instead, W should play as in variation. 

allpotti [8d?\]: then, which move is good instead?
NannyOgg [-\]: for W? maybe K3
NannyOgg [-\]: since both corners want to extend there
allpotti [8d?\]: wait a min

(;W[dj];B[fq];W[cn]LB[fc:B][fo:A]C[Nanny: A and B would be normal idea for black's next move.]

(;B[dr]LB[dr:A]TR[jp][fq]C[Since my group is already stable, is this too small to play now? Without it, W makes a big corner but in gote. My guess is that the marked stones are one space too far to omit this.

Nanny: A is not a good move here. The problem is that the marked stones are prone to invasion at H3. Black doesn't mind, because black has the sansan invasion (C3) as a backdoor. Once Black plays A and white replies with C3, that backdoor is gone
So the shape with A and the marked stones, is bad shape]

Nanny: Good idea.];W[ec];B[fd];W[cf]C[W has caught up on territory now (I think) but has two weak groups to attack. All of my groups are strong so I attack. My goal was to play some splitting attacks on the m15 stones and m7 stones hoping to kill one.

Nanny: Hmmmm, not sure how easy it is to kill one, so try to make profit while attacking. Attacking is usually not to kill, it is to take profit. Killing could be a bonus though :)]

[jb][ob][rb][nd][oe][sn][ko][gp][hp][ip][np][ds]C[Here I count W with 48 on the left and 30 on the right.
I have B as 30 on the bottom and maybe 10-20 on top.
W still has weak groups at A and B and C lives/dies with sente.

I could probably win the game here with some kind of move to seal up my center and trap B. If I failed to kill, I could still expect some thickness on the left to reduce W a little bit.

I think that sealing in 'B' is the largest of the three and killing 'C' is the smallest

Nanny: 
I showed triangles for my counts for W, squares for B
I get 29+28 = 57 for white
+ 2.5 for the C group (50 % for live with 5 pts or die) + 
6.5 komi
 
= 66

For black: I counted 30 + 15 for bottom (15 is half of C group, if W kills)
(If B to move first, B+25, if W to move first W+5)
so 40 + 12 + 7 = 64

But! Like you said, B and A and C are weak or close to death, so the game feels good for B to me. I would play S1 or J13 now, and that seems to seal the game.]
