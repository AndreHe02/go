C[This game was played via e-mail Myself (white) and a good friend. We are about even and I am
supposed to be about 18kyu.

Please review for both black and white as we both are anxious to learn. I put some comments at
various places in the game.

He claims I tend to play too much for influence, and I agree, but don't know where I can get
territory in this game without falling behind as his moves tend to push me out. (In my mind.)

C: Congratulations to white: From move 6 on you where ahead until your mistake at move 170.

The main theme in this game is influence. So my comments will mostly address this isue.

Wether you play on influence or on territory is your choice of strategy, and for beginners I recommend to learn to play with influence. This has several reasons:
a) When you play with handicap, you have to play on influence.
b) Most beginners don't know how to use influence, but it is importent, to know this, if you want to improve.
c) As black you can always play a san-ren-sei opening (Q16, Q4, Q10), which lets you get experience with influence.

Summarization:
WHITE should learn to defend his/her weak points (moves 26, 50, 94, 112 and 140), to deal with influence (move 34) and some skill at killing invading groups would not be wrong.

BLACK should learn to play with (or at least) against influence (moves 35, 37, 51, 53, 59 and 63). Also some fundamental knowledge in the opening would be good (moves 5,9,13,15,17 and 31).

Berni];B[qp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pc]MA[kp][kq][oq][op][pe][qe]C[C: A brief analysis of the opening pattern you have choosen: Both players have a stone at 4/4 and a stone at 3/4. Influence and territory is even. This is a common opening pattern.

The continuation from the fundamental principles of the opening would be to enclose the lower right corner or to approach the upper right corner. Here the second attempt is better, because of the continuation. See variation of the next move.

An other posibility is the chinese opening, where black plays L3 or L4 now.]

(;B[cl]MA[cj][op][pe]C[C: This is a strange move. If you want to extend from a stone at 4/4 you should go as far as C10. If the intension was to secure corner territory: This isn't possible with one move added to a 4/4 stone. Even if this stone were at C7 a 3/3-Invasion would be possible. This move leaves also the weakness at C6.

Standard moves were arround P4 and Q15. In this special case P4 would not be so good, see variation.]
;W[oq]MA[qe]C[C: This move is OK, but I think, R15 would be better, because the three stones would work together.]
;B[mq]C[C: Correct. Works well with the two stones at the left.]
;W[oo]C[C: Correct. Both stones are weak, so you should not attach to either of them.]
;B[pr]MA[qm]C[C: Ouch. Should be R7. Now white can play R6 and seal black in.]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[kq];B[qn]MA[qm]C[C: White gave you an other chance. But you missed by one point. R7 is much better. The two point jump at the third line can't be cut.]
;W[om];B[ql]MA[qk]C[C: Again R9 is better.];W[jd]MA[qo][qm]
[rl][sl][qq][ps]C[I played Clay a few weeks ago and in a similar position I played more stones in the group on
the lower right instead of a big point like k16. But he said afterwards that the stones on the
lower right were safe and I should have played elsewhere. So in this game I grabbed the k16
point figuring that the lower right was safe for now.

C: That's half correct. I would not say, that the group at the bottom is save. But if you loose it, you loose only 5 stones (your group is light). If you play more in this area, your group get's heavy, so you have to get it alive, or you'll lose much. Further, your stones at D16 and K16 are high, so you will probably have no difficulty in connecting your group to them.

In this stage of the game, the balance of territory and the balance of influence are very important. So you should start to estimate territory and influence.

BLACK: about 16 points of territory (bottom right), a small moyo (bottom left) almost no influence (only a little bit of D4)

WHITE: no territory at all, a large moyo (top) much influence (D16, K16, M4, P7)

Conclusion: Black should try to neutralize whites influence, white should try to use his/her influence.]
;B[ch]MA[qe][pe]TR[ql]C[C: This side isn't important. This move also isn't an aproach move to the corner. This shows again, that C8 is missplaced.

Better places are: R15/Q15 this prevents white from playing there and works well together with R8.]
;W[fq]MA[qe]C[C: OK, but R15 would be better. After R15. Both players are about equal on territory and white has much more influnce, so white should have no problems to win the game.]
;B[er]MA[cn]C[C: This move looks a little bit funny. You probably want to seal territory in the corner, but this doesn't work well, because there is a weakness at C6.]
;W[dq]MA[fr][cn][dn]C[C: I would have played F2. This works better with your group right and leaves the possibility at invading at C6 or reducing at D6 later.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[cq];W[do];B[cp];W[dr]MA[fo]C[C: Wrong! You should defend at F5.]

(;B[cr]C[C: How about E5? See variation.];W[fr];B[ds];W[fo]
;B[or]MA[qe]C[C:This move is an endgame move. You secure some territory (about 10 points) in gote. But there are much bigger points on the board. (R15)]
;W[qi]C[C: Now white played first in the important area.];B[qe]

(;W[pe]C[This is a point where I chose influence over territory. Probably r16 would have been a better
move.

C: Here is, where you can learn, how to use influence. R15 is a weak enemy group, which can be attacked.  And while attacking, you take some territory.  Your variation demonstrates how to do this.]
;B[qg]MA[pf]C[C: Blacks most important aim is to prevent white from making a wall, so black should hane at Q14. This move also weakens R11.]
;W[pf];B[qd]MA[pg]C[C: Again Q13 is more impotant.];W[qf];B[qc]
;W[qb]MA[rf]C[C: S14! This threatens to kill to corner and cuts black.]
;B[rb];W[pb]MA[pd]C[C: Q16 is more important. If black plays at Q18 it will be gote.]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[rh];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph];B[ri];W[pk]MA[pd]TR[jd]
[dd]C[C: This should be at Q16. This beautyfull wall without any defects works well with D16 and K16 and the influence gained is much more worth than the 10 points of territory, black got.]
;B[cf]LB[fc:A][gd:B]C[(JG) I did not think this was the best move. White got to continue building a huge wall
towards the center starting here.
Probably best would be A (f17) or B (g16) to reduce white's top and center influence.

C: Here again you can see the badness of the moves at C8 and C12. C12 should be at D11 now.

I would habe played at F17, because a stone on the third row is much more easy to settle.

G16 would probably be wrong. White cuts and black is in trouble.]
;W[df]C[Once again I chose influence over corner territory.

C: Here this choice is correct. If you manage to build a wall at the left side, which is equal to that of the right, your top territory should be secure (100 points).]
;B[cd]MA[dg]C[C: It is important to break into the moyo: D13]
;W[cc];B[de];W[ee];B[ce];W[ec];B[bc]MA[dg]C[C: Again D13 is more important.]
;W[dg]C[I was willing to give up some corner territory in order to keep building a center wall.

C: Correct choice. Stay with your strategy!];B[cb];W[dc];B[dj]
MA[ei]C[C: This move is territory orientated. Blacks only aim should now be, to get into whites moyo, but without influence, this is rather difficult. E11 looks appropriate.]
;W[cg]C[C: The combination resulting from this move is ok, but as black, I would have ignored it, because the top left lives on it's own, and to get into the moyo is much more important. My next move as black would have been G11.]
;B[bg]MA[gi];W[bh];B[bf];W[dh];B[ci];W[ej];B[el];W[gk];B[co]
LB[gm:A]MA[jc]C[Small because even if I pushed in here there wasn't much territory to loose by my pushing in.
Black should have split me with A (h7) (Which is where I played.)

C: This move is really small. But now it is too late for black to run in at A. White will use this to close the top territory. As far, as white is ahead in territory now, black's only hope is to invade.  (K17 might work.)]
;W[gm]TR[ej]MA[pd]C[C: Probably it would be better to fix the weaknesses (Q16 and arround E10).]
;B[nq]C[C: This move only helps white.];W[mp];B[np]C[C: Again.]
;W[no];B[op]C[C: An other completely unimportant point.];W[po]
C[C: This move is endgame. First fix your weaknesses (D11, which is sente, then Q16) and black should resign.]
;B[qo];W[pm];B[dn];W[eo]TR[do]MA[kr][db]C[C: Ouhh! E5 is completely worthless. There are much more bigger points. The weaknesses, mentioned earlier, L2 and D18.]
;B[en];W[fn];B[lc];W[jc]C[I keep in mind that I've been told several times that one should push an enemy stone towards
a wall.

C: This is correct.];B[pi];W[oi]C[Keep my center strong with sente.

C: That's great.];B[pj];W[oj];B[qj];W[qk]MA[pd]C[C: No! This move is unimportant. Q16 is a must! Nothing else.]
;B[rk];W[pl];B[qm];W[di]C[Four in a row are stronger than three and black has to defend the double atari.

C: OK, but after blacks response Q16.];B[cj];W[ek]MA[fj]C[C: Better at F10. This gives black a few points more, but you leave no weakness.]
;B[fl];W[gl];B[fk];W[fj];B[dk];W[kp]LB[le:A][pd:B][gj:C]C[I felt this was my weakest point. It was this or A (m15) or B (q16) or C(g10). In retrospect
B might have been sente because if black didn't respond white may have killed the corner. The
cut at C ended up being my downfall because of bad play.

C: The corner can't be killed, because it is connected to the bottem. You probably mean, that some stones of the corner can be captured.

A isn't really a weak point. When you play B, M17 will be dead anyway.]
;B[jb];W[ib];B[kb];W[le];B[nc]LB[pd:A]C[I ask myself why not A (q16). Really simple, really strong. Duh!

C: Both players missed this point.];W[oe]MA[pd]C[C: Empty triangle alarm! Q16 and the black stones are dead.]
;B[pd];W[oc]MA[od]C[C: P16 will give black less points in the corner and your outer shape will be stronger.]
;B[od];W[nd];B[nb];W[md];B[mc];W[db];B[ca]LB[bb:A]C[Best to connect at A (b18). That way black might play d19 during the endgame to steal a
point.];W[da];B[bb];W[kr];B[hg];W[jg];B[ld];W[ke];B[ne];W[me]
;B[nf];W[nh];B[lr]MA[gj]C[C: Black gives you a chance to protect your weak point at G10.]
;W[ic]MA[gj]C[C: Black can't achive much here. G10 is more important.]
;B[gj];W[gi]C[From this point I had to keep black from making two eyes in my center. I failed at move 170
by playing a nice looking cut without reading the rest of the board.

C: There were other moves before move 170 which could be stronger.]
;B[hj];W[hi];B[ik];W[jm]MA[ii]C[C: This move is wrong. J11 separates both black groups. The stone at H13 can't live, and the group in the bottom will have a hard time. There aren't any weaknesses in the white border.]
;B[fi];W[ei];B[fh];W[ff];B[ii]C[This move caught me by surprise. I just didn't see it. But I had to play 144 (f14) Now he has
one eye.

C: Now the game is very difficult for white. If the group manages to get life. white has lost the game.]
;W[ji]MA[ki]C[C: Probably too tight. L11 looks better. But this is very difficult, I can't say for sure.]
;B[ih];W[jj];B[jk];W[ij]C[C: This move is not good, because white has now a liberty less, and black won't play there anyway.]
;B[hk];W[kk];B[jh];W[kh];B[ki];W[kj];B[kg];W[lh];B[jf];W[kf]
;B[lg];W[if];B[ig];W[gg]MA[li][gh][hh]C[C: I don't see, what this move is good for. Black has to play at G12 and G13 later anyway. Capture L11 and the cake is eaten. (This is a german saying, I don't know, if it also exists in english.)]
;B[fg];W[gf];B[gh];W[hf]MA[li]C[C: Again M11 looks better.]
;B[kl];W[jl]C[I (white) lost on this move because it allowed black to gain two eyes. Should have played m10
or m11.

The black group isn't secure now, but it is heavy, so black has to do something about it. But, because the two stones at the left (C8 and C12) are low, this will be difficult. The marked places show, where you will play in the comming fight. Black has to run between these stones. After that, you have about 50 points of almost secure territory at the top and about 40 points of secure territory at the bottom. Black got nothing in compensation!]
