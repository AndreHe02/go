AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][dj][pj]C[WinPooh: This is one of my first games as White with high handicap. My opponent
resigned in the middle-game, but I'm not shure my position was clearly won, because
black could survive in center, I think. Please give me some advices about specifics
of handi games as White and point out my mistakes.];W[nq];B[jq]
;W[kq]C[It's not a good idea, I think, to play a contact move, even if that can stabilize your group.
It strentheng B position both in the left than in the right.]
;B[jp];W[kp]C[Now W is overconcentrated and has gote.
I would have prefeared to pincer B's corner both now than at the previous move.]
;B[kr]C[It's better to extend the lonley stone oin the corner.]
;W[lr]C[Very little: attacking the corner stone is better.
Also tenuki.];B[jr]C[Little, but now B has sure points on the left.]
;W[rp]C[An uncommon pincer. I would have played at R6, in this zone. Also tenuki.
The idea is not to let B escape on the outside.];B[qp];W[qq]
;B[ro];W[pq]C[This is good: stabilizing your groups in the very beginning allows fuure an easy tgame.]
;B[rq];W[rr]C[Endgame move.];B[sp]C[Very little];W[jd];B[np]
;W[op];B[oo];W[oq];B[no];W[pn];B[ql];W[po]C[I prefar to play elsewhere here and to cut when you have just stones in other part of the goban, even if the cutting cut is good.
It's a difficult game.];B[qn]C[Quite forced];W[pm]C[P7 is better because it put pressure to the weak group, not to the strong one.]
;B[mq]C[Useless, I think];W[lq]C[N2 whit no problems or R5 to fight (in agood position, I think)]
;B[lp];W[lo]C[N2 is sente. Your move good, tto.
You are ahead in the fight.];B[ko];W[ln]C[Very good.];B[mp]
;W[mr];B[nm];W[ml];B[om];W[pl]C[The sequence actually played is good.
It's difficult in this position to understand which is the best point.
Chaos is good for W in handicap games.];B[ol]C[A useless empty triangle.]
;W[pk]C[Right. P9 is too dangerous.
It's interesting to play at R5];B[ok];W[qk]C[Right again. Good sense of fight.
B's position on the right is very weak now.];B[qj]C[R7 would have lived.]
;W[rl];B[qm];W[qo];B[rp];W[rn];B[kn]C[P10 is the best point, because a cut here could destroy alla B's territory on the upper right.]
;W[lm]C[P10 is bigger.];B[ll];W[mm];B[kl];W[mj]C[N9 is safer.]
;B[mk];W[lk]C[Difficult again.
Maybe from the other side.];B[nk];W[km];B[jm]C[Not good.];W[jl]
;B[kk];W[jn];B[jo];W[im]C[Great: you are running inside your enemy's territory!]
;B[lj];W[rm]C[It's a little premature.];B[in];W[jm];B[hn];W[hm]
C[J10 makes better shape.];B[gn];W[gm];B[fn];W[fq]C[Too deep.  It's very hard to invade without mistakes of B]
;B[ls];W[nr]C[The left corner is bigger,now.];B[dq];W[hp];B[gc]
;W[eo];B[cn];W[en];B[fm]C[Fight is started again. B can make moves which attack two weak groups.
White can cut.];W[io]C[OK];B[em]C[B wants too much.
BH5 WJ4 BG4 and seki (perhaps).-];W[ip]C[H3 is better, because it destroys B's chances to make an eye.]
;B[er]C[The other side is weaker.];W[fr];B[hr];W[eq];B[dr];W[iq]
;B[ir];W[ms]C[Not good.];B[ks]C[Not good:G4 winning the capturing race.]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[ep];W[gr]C[You finally won the semeai!]
;B[gs];W[fs];B[fp];W[hs];B[ho];W[is];B[es];W[js];B[gl]C[O17 is bigger.]
;W[hl]C[There are no points here.];B[jk];W[hk];B[gk];W[mi]C[This is a heavy formation. It's better to let this stone diyng and to play on the upper right corner.]
;B[oj];W[qf]C[Good.
The fight is just at the beginning!];B[qe];W[nc]C[Q14 help your last stone and attacks B's big group.]
;B[nd]C[This syone helps a thin group to become thick.
Q14 is a great point, both making a lot of points and strenghtening B's big group.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]C[S15 is joseki.];B[lc];W[qd];B[pe];W[re]
;B[ob];W[oc];B[qb];W[od];B[oe];W[nb];B[pa];W[md];B[ne];W[mc]
C[Not a good result in the corner.
It was better to take completely the corner, before playing on the outside.]

C[I think that the game is just over now.
There are no B's points on the right, because W's corner has already run inside.
Again, B's big group is still a little weak.
W is ahead in points and his groups are all strong, so in makes easy an invasion at C17.
A game with very much fight and some mistakes.
