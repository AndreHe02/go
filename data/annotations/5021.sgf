C[This is probably the best game I played so far, although I ruined it with a huge blunder in the yose. I played as white.

Somehow, this it represents the best I can play so I would be very interrested in knowing how to improve my playing further on. I am sure both black and white made quite a few mistakes.

K: Hi! I'll mark my comments by "K".

K: The game is good. Both play a very peaceful fuseki. I would like to see more fighting, though! :) In my opinion the following are the most important things to pay attention to:
* In the fuseki (move 14-15) both players omit the big point of E10.
* At move 25 White may continue attack.
* At many points in the fuseki and middle game White has the option to invade but he doesn't. It is good to be calm and not rush to invasions but sometimes an invasion is called for.
* Both players make a 3-3 invasion that loses points (moves 53 and 72). Black mistake is bigger, though.
* Move 93 is a mistake. You know the life&death in the corner now :). It is always useful to study life&death.

K: I give some variations along the way. They don't cover all possibilities and all judgements but hopefully they give something to think about and answer some of your questions.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[ck]LB[fc:A][gp:B]C[K: The low Chinese opening. Your move A is common. Another common move is B. Invading at D5 is not considered good at this stage.]

(;W[fc];B[df];W[jd];B[nq]C[K: The opening is quite common, but in my opinion difficult.

K: If Black gets a stone at K5, then D5 will become an important point because Blacks moyo is really big. You must have a plan now to deal with that.]

(;W[qn]C[K: This is a possibility and Q6 is similar. You have no weak groups so you can invade Black moyo. Your development on the right and at the top is also good, but Black moyo will be big.]
;B[jp]LB[pj:A][do:B]C[K: Black has a big moyo. Your move at A is not a bad one but I think it is not the sharpest move. I think now is the time to invade at B.]

(;W[pj]LB[jj:A]C[I was not so happy with this move because of the possible black move at A which would lead to a huge black moyo. I believe I was somehow fortunate black did not play it.]

(;B[do]SQ[ek]C[K: This is a huge move. Both players have big moyos. E9 is a big point for reduction]

(;W[jj]LB[qf:A][ek:B]C[So I was the one with the big moyo in the end.

K: It is difficult to find a good invasion point. Black can in my opinion choose own development at B, because White can't eliminate all weaknesses in his moyo by a single move.]

(;B[qf]C[K: The invasion is deep. With White K10 White will probably get a good result.]
;W[qe];B[pf];W[nd];B[ph];W[qi];B[mg];W[nj]LB[md:B][kg:A]
(;B[kg]C[K: Black should try to find something less heavy.]
;W[ld]C[K: White attack is already a success.];B[no]C[K: This is a big point but it is dangerous to leave the weak group.]

(;W[di]C[K: This move seems to be a compromise between invasion, reduction and a large scale attack. I prefer E10 or E9 for reduction (still attacking), and maybe a probe at D2 for invasion.  I would personally probably attack directly to prepare for invasions on the left and lower side.]
;B[ek];W[fi];B[ff];W[ih];B[lj]C[K: Black shape looks questionable but it's not easy to find the way to exploit it.]

(;W[jl];B[ll]LB[li:B][om:A][hq:C]C[K: Now Black shape is cuttable at B. I think it's time to invade at C even if it means two weak groups. The center stones have the cut at B and jump at J14 and they have a light shape. The exchange at A to M6 helps Black.]

(;W[om];B[ln]C[K: The exchange P7 M6 helps Black. The center White stones have less options and invasion is more difficult.]
;W[gk]C[K: The vital point.];B[gl]C[K: Now Black is slightly ahead in territory. You may still want to invade later (maybe at D2 or even H3) so it's better not to force Black to become solid. Now H16 is big, it is big territory for both sides and it helps the White group in the center and makes the cut at M11 more severe.]

(;W[hl];B[gm];W[hm];B[gn];W[cg]C[K: Unneccessary. Removes aji from the corner. H16 is big.]
;B[cf]C[K: Now Black is ahead in territory.]
(;W[re]C[K: Defending the corner is not awfully big, H16 is biggest in my opinion.]
;B[hn]C[K: This is big. Black has more than 60 points in the lower side - White must kill something to win now.]
;W[fk];B[el];W[in];B[io];W[jn];B[kp];W[hd]LB[qq:A][pr:B]C[K: Good point.]

K: This is a mistake by Black. If Black has a stone at M3 then this kind of play would be ok.]
