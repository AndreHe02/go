C[Kyoshinai [17k\]: Hello !

I played this game on kgs, where I am black (17k) and my opponent is white (16k).

There are a few major points I'd like to have analyzed. First is a life and death in the upper-left corner, then a life and death in the right. Though I feel there could have been a way, I could not find it, neither in the game nor after.
I lost by quite a huge margin, therefore I'd like to know the big points I missed. Finally, I'm also interested in yose, since I always do poorly in that part of the game.

Please feel free to make any comment on white's moves, too.

Thank you for your time :)

z:  Game reviewed by "zenjutsu" (6k* IGS).  Reviewer comments preceeded by "z:".

z:  I shall do my best to answer your questions, as well as provide general commentary on the game.  As I am only a 6k, please do not view my suggestions as  "the absolute truth".]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[de];W[pp];B[cn];W[fq];B[dj]C[z:  Possible, but remember that this is not yet secure.  A safer extension is D9.  Just remember that this area will need to be strengthened later, or it will be attacked.]
;W[ec]C[z:  This approach is not correct.  The approaches listed as joseki are C17 and D17.  This simply invites B to C17, thus gaining much territory _and_ taking sente.]
;B[cc]C[z:  Yes!];W[ic]C[z:  W's extension seems too far when close to B's strength.  B should punish this at some point in the game.]
;B[qn];W[pj];B[rp]SQ[np][nq][qq]C[z:  This play is not in Kogo's Joseki Dictionary.  When W Q10, B's options are the marked points.  The B play at S4 is too easy for W to respond to; W should R3 to maintain sente and begin securing the bottom, then when B secures his 2 stones, W can play in middle-bottom to strengthen claim.]
;W[qq]C[z:  W responds appropriately.]
(;B[oo]C[z:  No.  W should punish this play.  Too many cutting points are left.  Also, it does not help B live, but it does force W to strengthen his own weakness.  If B's intention is to run to the center, then P6 is the play.  If B's intention is eyespace, then R8 or R9.  If B's intention is to reduce W's bottom, then wait till after securing the two stones and play K4 or L4 later in game.  

z:  I have made two alternative move trees: the first is with W cutting.  It's a tough cut, but I think it is doable for W. The second is an alternative "safe play" that shows a comparison up to move 17.]

(;W[op]C[z:  W opts for a safe acquisition of territory.  Also an acceptable route.  This is what I meant by "force W to strengthen his own weakness".  Furthermore, B is still not alive.  B will have to play another stone to make eyespace.]
;B[qk]C[z:  If you did not look at the alternative move tree at move 15, do so now.]
;W[qf]
(;B[qe]C[z:  Wrong joseki.  Since W has Q10, this attachment does not threaten W, rather it only forces W to strengthen his weakness. Furthermore, with W's weak stones in upper-left, I prefer a play like shown in alternative move tree.]
;W[pf];B[nc];W[lc];B[mb]C[z:  Again, you are forcing W to fix his own weakness.  While you need a stone to secure your corner (if playing a "safe" game, which is wise at your kyu rank), I prefer the one at S15.]
;W[lb];B[np]C[z:  Troublesome.  Too many cutting points, and too easy for W to simply respond at O3, thus fixing his own weakness.  If you intend to reduce W, the place to play is along the bottom-center.]
;W[nq];B[mp];W[mq];B[ok]TR[qh][re][hq][en][dl][dh][ch][cg][dg]
[gc]SQ[qm][ql][nn][no][on][ol][om][pm][pl]C[z:  Too small.  This secures an additional 9 points (I'm being generous in my estimate).  Other options are around triangle marked spots.]
;W[co];B[dn]C[z:  D8 is safer.];W[po]C[Kyoshinai [17k\] : I realized I should not have let white play here, since it threatens all the moyo I had planned to build there

z:  The moyo you planned to build does not appear as valuable as protecting your side or attacking W's weaknesses.]
;B[pn];W[be];B[cg];W[bc]
(;B[cb]C[Kyoshinai [17k\] : At first I intended on killing the white stones, thus I did not want white to connect. But I failed, and got killed instead. Was there a move that could have succeeded ?

z:  First, there might be a way to kill W.  However, I must confess that my life-and-death skills are less than perfect.  My strength tends to lie with.... well, I'm not certain (I'm purely self-taught), but I know life-and-death sure isn't it.  But what I like to do is change direction of the game in a way my opponent might not expect.

z:  For example: W has a _lot_ of weakness on the board right now.  Sometimes, allowing a group to live, but making strength in the process will allow you to attack a _different_ weak group. That's the route I'd take.]

(;W[ca]C[z:  W didn't need to play here yet.];B[ed]C[z:  Too small, and just forces W to strengthen his own weaknesses.]
;W[fd];B[fc]C[Kyoshinai [17k\] : I do not really know why I played here. Maybe I was thinking I could invade or something, or that white would respond badly.

z:  It is good that you see (in hindsight) that this was a mistake. Try not to play stones that rely on an opponent's mistake to become "good".  If it is only good after an opponent's mistake, then it's not actually "good", rather it is "lucky".]
;W[gd];B[me]C[Kyoshinai [17k\] : Maybe I should have protected around O6 first

z:  I think this stone is acceptable.  It threatens W's right group.  Whether or not it is the best play available, I am uncertain.]
;W[le]C[z:  No!  W _completely_ misreads the threat.];B[mg]
;W[re];B[rd];W[rf]C[marttiku [16k\]: i would have attacked at S11 now as B
Kyoshinai [17k\] : I was afraid of white escaping

Kyoshinai [17k\] : At this point, I was thinking about killing white, but failed to do so. I tried to spend some more time on it afterwards, but I still couldn't see a solution. I'm quite interested on knowing whether there is a way for black to kill.

z:  Sometimes the best way to approach a situation is to consider "if my enemy lives, what will I gain".  Focusing always on the kill, and then failing to get it, usually results in severe pain for yourself.  On the other hand, focusing on threatening the enemy, and then reaping the rewards of your threat (even without killing) is more prudent.]
;B[ph]C[z:  This seems acceptable.];W[qh];B[qi];W[ri];B[pi]
;W[qg]
(;B[sh]C[z:  S10 is the play.  First, S10 ensures that even if white lives, you gain profit from your attack.  Furthermore, I think S10 kills white; but I am not 100% certain.]
;W[sg];B[rh];W[rj];B[rk];W[qj]C[Kyoshinai [17k\] : I should probably have played T15 now, but again I feared white's escaping]
;B[oj];W[se]
(;B[og]C[z:  I prefer enclosing white with sente play at Q9, then playing big play at bottom.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[sd];B[rc];W[sc];B[rb];W[jq]C[z:  W's play here is significant.]
;B[kg]C[z:  No threat to W.  Not sente.  Furthermore, W takes advantage of sente to devestate B's right, and take over game.]
;W[no]C[Kyoshinai [17k\] : This point got out of my mind, and I'm losing quite much here

z:  Yes, the game now appears very firmly in W's hands.];B[nn]
;W[on];B[om];W[mn];B[oo];W[mo];B[mm]
(;W[kn]C[z:  M7 better.];B[fo]C[Kyoshinai [17k\] : I feared white would widen his moyo too much, and thought I had to prevent him from doing so. However, this move did not hurt white, and he could go on with reducing me on the right.

z:  Your hindsight is accurate.];W[el]C[z:  I don't like this play.]
;B[gl];W[lm];B[ml]
(;W[gk]C[z:  Nor do I like this one.  Too easily cut.  This shows why E8 was perhaps less than idea.  However, W could still have F9 instead of this.]
;B[hk];W[gj];B[hj];W[gh];B[fk]C[Kyoshinai [17k\] : I did not want white to connect his E8 stone, lest he could do serious damage inside my moyo.]

[bb][ha][ga][fa][ea][ba]C[z:  Ultimately, I feel that B's greatest weakness in this game was in the fuseki.  B allowed W to control the fuseki, and W built a much stronger position.  This enabled W to control the midgame.

z:  Also, B was too focused on killing weak W groups, as opposed to _threatening_ to kill W groups **without** intention of fulfilling the kill, but using the threat to make profit.

z:  Overall, I think B did a good job of reviewing his own game. This is an excellent sign of somebody who will progress in the game.  I highly encourage B to continue to play the game, continue to experiment, and continue to improve.

z:  Thank you for the opportunity to review your game!])
(;B[as]C[z:  If B plays somewhere else (NOT here, I'm just getting a stone out of the way to demonstrate that T6 was not yet necessary), then W still cannot yet hurt B on Right.]
