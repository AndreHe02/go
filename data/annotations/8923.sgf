C[Hello, I'm Tilwen, white in this game, a 1 stone handicap. I lost by time but I was losing anyway I think, and I feel like I didn't take advantage of my position in a good timing.
  Black let some kind of weak groups and at some moment didn't go to protect them, and then managed to have a great area of influence on the upper side, but I didn't succeded in attacking his weak group or making use of my thickness.
  Any advise is welcome !];B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[cn];W[cj]
C[krv: B10 - not seen before.
Ususal are F12, C8, D9];B[fp];W[co]C[krv: D6 is usual];B[dn]
;W[eo];B[do];W[ep];B[cp];W[cq];B[bo];W[bp];B[dk];W[dj]C[krv: if you are extending here you should be ready to spend another move - otherwise just leave it as it is. F3 is better]
;B[ek];W[fq]C[I followed one joseki ...];B[cg]C[And I didn't know how to handle this, I was thinking C15 would be better and had a feeling that C16 or C15 for me later would be good.

krv: may be tenuki? this group is already heavy and cut two very strong black groups. C15 is possible now too.]
;W[ej];B[fk];W[fj];B[gj];W[gi];B[gk];W[fh];B[qn]C[In this corner things haven't gne that well, when did i do a mistake ?

krv: F10 group does very small profit.];W[ql];B[nq];W[oo]C[krv: I don't like P5. Q6 is usual]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[om];B[pm]C[krv: Q8 instant is better];W[pn]
C[maybe here ?];B[qm];W[pl];B[ol];W[qo]C[krv: Useless move.]
;B[ro];W[po];B[nm];W[on];B[rm];W[rl];B[sn];W[ok]C[krv: no use. this move is good if black p9 hurts you.]
;B[nl];W[mo];B[qi];W[pj];B[kq]C[This groupd on the lower side wasn't supposed to be big right ? But my group is weak too ...

krv: fuseki and tuban are deciding which groups are living and which are dead. Your group Q5 is very vulnerable - thus black group could be very big in a few moves.]
;W[mj];B[ll];W[ko];B[lp];W[mn]C[krv: I believe that simple connection is  the best as usual. Now you should take care about cutting point.]
;B[ip];W[in];B[lo];W[ln];B[kn]C[krv: black are very kind here. I'd not let you survive so easy with Q5 group.]
;W[km];B[jn];W[jm];B[jo];W[kk];B[jd]C[First tenuki, how to attack the big black group on the lower left side now ?

krv: You shouldn't. I like R17 here.];W[io];B[kp];W[gn];B[ij]
;W[hi];B[jk];W[kj];B[ji];W[il];B[ik];W[hf]C[krv: I like H16 here. It strenghtens G11 and affects black top territory]
;B[hd];W[jf]C[krv: G11 looks already living and K14 makes no territory. I think you are behind now and should think about resign.]

;B[al];W[ak];B[am];W[bn];B[cl];W[an];B[bk]C[White is behind here I think, how to handle the upper side ? I tried to invade but it didn't work that well ...

krv: I see no invade which makes play equal. You should defend at S14 first. May be you could manage to live with B14 - but almost hopeless. The only chances are black mistakes.]
