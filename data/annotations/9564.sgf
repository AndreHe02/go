Hi Bart,
Here is my review of your game from GTL,
If you have any questions feel free to ask.
Paul Ohmart];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[hc]LB[ic:A]C[Usulally played at A to form the Chinese fuseki.]

(;W[qo];B[or];W[oq];B[nr];W[nq]
(;B[cm]LB[cn:A]C[I would approach closer at A];W[mr];B[pq];W[mq]

(;B[di]C[B: or is this too loose and should I play e.g. C10 or E17?

This is fine. D10 is another possibility.];W[em]C[With this move the focus of the game shifts to the center.]

(;B[ji]C[B: good idea or not?];W[hi];B[jg];W[dc]

(;B[fh]C[B: I wanted to attack the white group some more...]
;W[gh]
(;B[fg];W[hf];B[if]C[B: ... but I didn't count on this move. Which gives white sente.]
;W[fi]
(;B[ei]C[Sort of like pushing from behind.];W[fj];B[dk];W[nf]
C[B: and white now gets the big move. Should I've played this earlier, or was there a way to keep sente?]
;B[jk];W[kh];B[jh];W[ie]
(;B[hd];W[jf];B[ig];W[je];B[kg];W[le];B[kd];W[lf];B[kc]C[B: now my group is but off in the center. Not too good.]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[li];B[ki];W[lg];B[lj];W[mi]C[Your center group is in dire straights. You must play to keep it alive and have no time to think of anything else.]

(;B[fk]LB[fe:A][jh:B]C[B: I still want to cut off that group, but what is the way to do that?

White's A group is much stronger that your B group.

It is larger so it has more liberties.
It has the possibillity of making an eye at E-17 and can aim to make one at G-11 or connect.

The black group is adrift in a sea of white and has little potential to make eyes. 

This is not the time to put the two groups in direct conflict since his is stronger.]
;W[gk];B[fl]
(;W[ij]
(;B[gl];W[jj];B[kj];W[hk]LB[hk:B][gl:A]C[B: I was afraid of L9.

The problem is that the A-B exchange has made the white group alive.]

;B[hn];W[jp];B[ko];W[mm];B[km];W[ik];B[gj];W[fb]C[B: now the white group is alive...

It was before as there was no way to prevent this sequence of moves.]

(;W[nj]C[B: with this response it works

Yes, he made a mistake.

You played very well here to punish it.];B[nn];W[mo];B[mp];W[no]
;B[np];W[op];B[oo];W[on];B[lm];W[om];B[lk]C[B: but again lost sente.

Yes. I don't see any way for you to catch up from here.

If it does manage to live or connect he will probably give you a chance to close of the top and leave you with sente to go after white's center. He will make no points here himself.]

You can look to play at A or B later to reduce white on the bottom or make territory on the top for yourself.]

This is the second example of missing a very basic joseki pattern. The pattertns iin the upper right and lower right are seen over and over in Go and if you got nothing else but an understanding of them both from this game it would be well worth it.

I would recommend finding some joseki books and focusing on learning both of these patterns.]

Note that you can jump into the corner later if you don't play the A-B exchange.]
;W[qo];B[rn]C[Sometimes this exchange occurs during the course of the joseki but it still leaves the corner open and hurts white's territory on the  right so black should have no problem with it.]
)))
(;B[rc]C[This move is an absolute "must". It creates a solid live group with good territory and good end game position in the corner.

This is one of the most basic shapes and it would be worthwile to think about it.

It is an excellent example of the proverb play urgent points before big ones.

Your play at R6 was certainly a 'big point'. But this is urgent.]
