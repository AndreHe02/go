C[We both are quite new to this game. My opponent has played some games at his schools Go club and i have played for about 3 days. I am playing white and writing these questions/comments. We'd appriciate some comments on general playing style and places where you think we have made big mistakes. Thank you.

xed_over: Thank you for allowing me to comment on your game. I hope my comments prove useful. The main things I see are: 
1) learn to protect your cuts -- close fist before striking (proverb)
2) count your liberties
3) look for bigger or more important/critical moves first.]

C[xed_over: the 5-4 openings are rather agressive for beginners. More common are the 3-4 or 4-4 openings.]

(;B[eo]CR[gn]LB[co:A][cp:B]C[We discussed this move later on. Would it have been better to not connect and play somewhere like G6 or something similar instead?

xed_over: connection plays are generally bad, but I would not have recommended G6 either. Instead, perhaps an approch move underneath to establish a stronger base. Its much easier to make secure territory in the corners and along the sides first. Leave the middle fighting to later in the game.]

(;W[fo]LB[do:A][dp:B][eq:C]C[Fight starts. Is this the right course of action for white in such a situation?

xed_over: there are several possibilities. too early to tell which might be better. To some degree, this works well with your opposite corner stone, but playing on the other side to try to strengthen this corner or just extending from your stone might also work just as well, if not better.]
;B[en];W[fn]LB[fp:A]C[xed_over: protect your cuts first];B[dm]
LB[em:A][dp:B]C[xed_over: why swrink away now? keep the pressure on white, and claim larger territory for yourself at A or B.]
;W[hm]LB[dp:B][gp:A]C[xed_over: Its really too early for a center game yet. You should try to establish a strong territorial base first, then you can easily push into the center. A is critical, B would be okay too.

Generally you'll want to try and secure corners first, then sides. Leave the center fights til later.]
;B[fm];W[gm]
(;B[hl]LB[hk:2][fl:A][gl:1][il:3]TR[fm]C[xed_over: stay away from contact plays. they weaken you unnecessarily. see, you only have 3 liberties left, and now its white's turn. a stronger play would have been to extend your weak stone at F7]
;W[gl];B[gk]LB[hk:B][fl:C][il:A];W[hk]
(;B[hj]LB[il:A]TR[gk][fm]C[xed_over: no need to abandon your stone so early. there's room to run -- and hopefully keep white separated, otherwise you're leaving a trail of weak unprotected stones.]
;W[il]
(;B[ik]LB[gj:B][fl:A]C[xed_over: critical, protect your weak stones first]

TR[ek][dl]C[xed_over: very good! now you're protecting your cuts]

(;W[og]LB[mo:A]TR[jj][jl][im][fp]C[Since i felt that the situation at the lower left has cooled down a bit, i decided to strenghten my position at Q16 while also strenghtening my position at the middle (specially strenghtening the J10 and L9 stones). Is this a ok place to play, or should i have played somewhere else?

xed_over: too far away to help either Q16 or the middle. You still have too many dangerious cutting points with your middle group. Instead of trying to "connect" your two separate groups, you should strengthen your own groups by attacking your opponent. (ignoring your cutting points for a moment) a play at A would be an example.]
;B[mg]LB[nd:A][qh:B][oq:C]C[xed_over: no need to worry about what white is doing in the middle. white doesn't have much territory yet, so you should go claim it instead.

For example, A, B or C are big moves setting up moyos that will be easy to turn into territory that white can't take away. Let white take the center, and you'll have much bigger territorial points along the sides and in the corners.]
;W[kh]LB[ji:B][jj:A][kj:C]C[Trying to attack black at N13 while strenghtening the 2 white stones in the middle.

xed_over: A play at A would actually strengthen those two stones better. This move doesn't really do much. But you've got the right idea though!]
;B[jj]TR[kh]C[xed_over: see, it was no help at all :(];W[ii]

(;B[kk]LB[jl:A]TR[jk][il]C[xed_over: take advantage of the double atari.]

(;B[co]LB[dp:A]C[xed_over: why not just take the whole corner?]
;W[dp];B[bn]LB[cp:A]C[xed_over: no need to swrink away just yet, keep the pressure on.]
;W[km];B[lm];W[kn];B[hg];W[lk]LB[ec:G][jc:D][mc:A][fd:H][qj:B]
[qk:C][mp:E][np:F]C[xed_over: good, but you can do that anytime later. even if you can't later, there are still bigger moves on the board (in no particular order)

keep the pressure on, and you'll be able to come back to this move later.]
;B[ll];W[mj];B[mk];W[lj];B[nl]
(;W[kg]LB[kf:A]C[xed_over: too slow

but you should really be doing just the opposite -- establish a base on the side and run to the center, instead of establishing a base in the center and running to the sides.]

;B[pi];W[ph];B[qj];W[qi];B[pk]LB[fd:B][ld:A][mo:D][oq:C]C[xed_over: look for the bigger moves]

(;W[pj]LB[ec:E][ld:A][cp:D][lp:B][oq:C]C[xed_over: no need to worry about this one stone. Much bigger moves are on the board]
;B[ln]C[Black starts to get a strong position at lower right. Should i have (as white) moved in there to fight or leave it alone?

xed_over: you bet! A long time ago :)];W[lo]LB[ko:A]C[Here im trying to make the black area smaller, while strenghtening my low middle.

xed_over: but it leaves a dangerous cutting point at A. Better to play at A first]
;B[mo];W[lp];B[mp];W[le];B[ke];W[ld]C[Trying to strenghten my position at the top right.

xed_over: learn to strengthen your positions with larger moves. Stake out potential territories, then connect them later.]
;B[kd];W[jh]LB[ec:D][ko:A][cp:B][pq:C]C[xed_over: that move does nothing. Your center goup is already safe and doesn't need any reinforcement. Go find some bigger or more critical moves on the board.]
;B[ig];W[hi]LB[ec:A][dh:B]C[How should i have tried to move into the left center/left upper corner. As seen this try doesnt do so much good.

xed_over: just jump right in. there's lots of room - almost an entire 9x9 area to play in]

;B[kb];W[ia]C[I decide here that its more important for me to get a foothold at the left upper side than losing some stones at the right upper corner. Was this the right course of action?

xed_over: while it may not be the right action, it is indeed the right way to think! That is being willing to sacrifice a small area for a potential bigger area!]

C[xed_over: need to protect your cuts first];W[ff]C[From this point on, do you have any suggestions how i should have continued my attack on the left side? At this point i was starting to run out of ideas. (Except for the D-18,D-17 and D-16 stones i play)

xed_over: At this point, you're still ahead - some big weaknesses, but ahead none-the-less.

the main thing is to keep counting your own groups while expanding and attacking your opponent's groups]
;B[eg];W[db]LB[ca:A][ha:1][ec:2][hc:B][ee:3][ef:4][hf:6][fg:5]
C[xed_over: very nice double atari, but you didn't take advantage of it later on.

keep track of your group's liberties. At the moment, you've got enough that you shouldn't need to worry, and a play at A, B or 1 if you get into a tight spot.]
;B[ec]LB[ca:A][ha:1][hc:B][ee:2][ef:3][hf:5][fg:4]C[xed_over: notice which direction your oppenent played. You pushed him right into your own group reducing that groups liberties by one - from 6 to 5

Still no worries with a play at A, B or 1]
(;W[dc]LB[ca:A][ha:1][cb:B][ee:2][ef:3][hf:5][fg:4]C[xed_over: you should have taken, or at least expanded so that he couldn't have escaped.]
;B[sl]LB[ha:1][ee:2][ef:3][hf:5][fg:4];W[dd]LB[ha:1][ee:2][ef:3]
[hf:5][fg:4]C[xed_over: humm... now think about what that move will do -- black doesn't want to lose 3 stones, so he will connect at e15 taking away yet another liberity.

Not too bad, if you're counting liberties. Gives you a larger chunk of the corner.]
;B[ee]LB[ca:A][ha:1][hc:B][ef:2][hf:4][fg:3]C[xed_over: down to 4 liberties. But still okay with a play at A, B or 1]
;W[rk]LB[ha:1][bc:F][ef:2][hf:4][fg:3][jn:A][ko:C][fp:E][cq:B]
[br:D]C[xed_over: not really necessary for now. keep the pressure on in the corner (or protect some of your other bigger weak spots)]
;B[ef]LB[ca:A][ha:1][hc:B][hf:3][fg:2]C[xed_over: down to 3 liberties! keep counting!! Since you let him get a free move over there, he's going to catch you unaware.

But you're still safe with a play at A, B or 1.]
(;W[hf]CR[gg]LB[ca:A][ha:1][hc:B][if:3][fg:2]C[xed_over: Bad. This move gained you nothing, since you still only have 3 liberties, and now you've pushed black's atari'ed stone into trapping you even further.

Even if you atari on the other side, while still not a good play, would have been better than this.]
;B[gg]LB[ha:1][if:3][fg:2];W[fg]LB[ca:A][ha:1][hc:B][if:3][fh:2]
C[xed_over: nothing to gain here. still only 3 liberties.

remember to look for moves that increase your liberties, rather than reduce them or leave them the same -- and if at the same time you can reduce your opponent's liberties, then all the better.]
;B[fh]LB[ca:A][ha:1][hc:B][if:2]C[xed_over: critical - count your liberties! Down to only 2. Two or less and you're soon dead. Time to act!

now that you've been blocked on all sides, the ONLY plays you have left are at A, B or 1! You cannot play at 2, as it takes away one of your own liberties leaving you with only one left.]

(;W[if]LB[ha:1]TR[ie]SQ[da][gb][gc][gd][hd]C[xed_over: oooh, you played at 2. Very bad! You just took away your own liberity, leaving only one -- and now its your opponent's turn. :(

I see that you perhaps had your eye on putting j15 into atari, but keep your eye on the bigger picture - you already had two other groups in atari (groups that could have rescued yours), but didn't do anything about it. No need to try and put another stone in atari. Especially this one :)

this was your losing move, otherwise you would have won the game.]
;B[ha]C[I (white) didnt notice the threat and lost the entire upper left side due to it. Since black now had a quite a strong position in the upper right as well and good(?) defences in the lower right i decided to resign. Could you comment on the trap that my opponen set for me (he told me later when we were discussing that he had planned it for a while). Also would there had been any solution for me to keep fighting, or was resigning the only possibility? I would also like to ask about blacks defence at lower right, i couldn't find any way through it, so i'd like to ask if there is one.]

(;W[hc]LB[ib:1]C[xed_over: hummm.. again, not counting your liberties -- took away your 2nd liberity, leaving only one now.]

yet there are more urgent moves on the board still.])
