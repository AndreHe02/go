C[kex: Hi, I am Jouni, 9k FI, 16k IGS, and try to give useful comments on the game.

kex: You build a big moyo in the game.  The idea of a moyo is not for making territory, but for building power.  When the opponent invades, you have the possibility to play as in a handicap game, aggressively, and while the opponent makes life, you get profit on the outside.  So when the opponent comes to your moyo, you should welcome him with an attack.  Do not be scared of that, it is exactly what you were waiting for.

kex: I hope you find this review useful.  Good luck with your go studies.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[pk];W[dh];B[jp];W[cm]C[kex: OK.  So far it seems that black is aiming for lots of influence by creating a big moyo.  White plays more thickly, trying to secure some territory on the left.  Currently, it is not territory, but the left side could also be invaded.  It is more natural, however, to continue making a bigger moyo for black, and wait for a white invasion.]
;B[fq];W[er]
(;B[qn]C[kex: this move seems a bit overconcentrated.  See variations.  The idea of your original opening was to invite a white invasion to this area.  If white would invade here, he would be in an unfavourable position...]
;W[gr]
(;B[fr];W[fs];B[gq];W[hr];B[hq];W[ir]
(;B[mq]C[kex: you can let him crawl as much as he likes, because he is doing himself just harm, but you _need_ to stay connected...  White is too strong on the left now to let the cut happen.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[hp]
(;B[gp];W[ho];B[in];W[hn];B[im];W[fn];B[jj]LB[jc:B][oc:A]C[kex: this move does make your bottom right moyo stronger, but the upper side is bigger.  See e.g. A or B.  Moyo's are created for fighting, so you still expect white to invade your moyo.  Do not try to transform it to territory.]
;W[qh];B[qg]C[kex: do not attach to an attacking stone.  It is still weak, but you force it to become stronger now]
;W[rg];B[qf];W[rf];B[ri];W[rh];B[qi];W[ph]C[kex: you should attack one point further away.  when you keep touching, you also remove your own liberties.]
;B[nc];W[pf];B[pe];W[pg]
(;B[kd]LB[qh:A]C[kex:  This was something extraordinary of a move!  Let's view at the situation so far:  white group A is weak, and does not have any eyes, but has room for one eye on the first line.  There are two strong black groups around it that have no problems.  Now, what should you do?

kex: answer:  attack the white group so that it has to run, while making territory up.  See variation]
;W[qe]C[kex: Now white is extremely secure, and you cannot attack it efficiently  any more.]

;W[mm]C[kex: take care of the eyes of the group.  your stones near sides are all alive, so do not fight useless ko:s while the opponent is making life.]
;B[po];W[lk]C[kex: now white has one eye.  why give another?]
;B[on];W[nk]
(;B[kr];W[ol]
(;B[ls]C[kex: now what do we have.  White was able to live in a place where he should not have.  The reason is simple - you let him bully around in a place where you are strong.  Concentrate on making sure your opponent does not get eyes in this kinds of situations.  More life-and-death problem solving :)]

;W[gd]
(;B[hd]LB[ed:B][gd:A]C[kex: you might consider attacking from other directions, although in this case (due to the wall around the white group) this attack seems to work)]
;W[ge];B[gc];W[ee];B[fc];W[dd];B[dj];W[ei];B[nf]LB[gq:A]C[kex:  why do you abandon your attack in the middle?  You still have the A group that you can use as a threat when white seals you in.  Do not change your mind after you start doing something.  And remember - if white answers, you did not lose points...
