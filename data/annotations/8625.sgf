C[claude> So black remained slightly ahead although his mistakes in the yose.
claude> From this game, I think you should remember two thinks:
claude> 1) early cuts can do a lot of damage, so in the lower left corner, you should have connected at E4 rather than playing D3, and taken the outside (and this is more even true when you have a stone of yours facing your wall).
claude> 2) you should always reinforce yourself before attacking: it doesn't make sense to attack with a weak group.
