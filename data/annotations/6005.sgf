C[ragkgs: this is the kind of game i dont enjoy because its all fighting  - maybe because my fighting ability is weak :).  please can the reviewer show me how to deal simply with white's aggressive style, making eyes and connections?

shan [2k\]: hi
ragkgs [3k\]: hi

hi ragkgs, my name is Neil and i am about 1dan/1kyu on kgs
however i have not played much go in the last 6 months so perhpas i am a bit rusty.]

C[The move I'd choose myself];W[qf]C[ragkgs: a typical aggressive kyu-level move.  but as a kyu player too, how should i respond?

There a few possibilities here.
The R14 move does not seem a good move but to punish I think black might try pincer]

;W[cd];B[dg];W[ef];B[ci];W[ck]C[again white comes very close; how to handle this?

This is a reasonable move by white. 
I would suggest blacks next move be at top right since there are 2 weak white stones and black c14 is reasonably strong enough to survive an attack.]

;W[gh]
(;B[ie]C[still forgot.....

I dont know about this j15 it looks good but since d13 can be atari'd at e13 h14 might be better]
;W[dh]C[oops!];B[ag];W[eg]C[the corner stones are gone, so should i just come out at e10? or try for complications with c7?]

(;B[bf];W[bj];B[dg];W[cg];B[dj];W[el]C[the first white move i admired...now what?

yes white e8 is good];B[ac];W[bb];B[fj]
(;W[hh]C[i was pleased to see this; it lets the side group breathe, but how to make escape certain?]

(;B[hj]C[This is reasonable, g9 might be ok too];W[dk]C[Cant say i like this move much]

(;B[fh]C[Were you trying to protect against e10?]
(;W[fg]C[Seems white does not need to connect here although white does have a nice attack on black so is ok]
;B[fk]
(;W[dq]C[seems to show lack of imagination, but it does create a large territory.

how to handle it?  should i come in at d6 straight away? e6?

are the upper white stones attackable?  is there a way to induce white to get black to play at f6?

D6 would be too deep in my opinion. e6 is better but calls for right timing, too early i think.

ok, so upper white stones are weak, and black has sente, i think black still has chances in the game if he attacks white weak stones.

So black wants to pincer r14 and create split attack on k16 / r14 and at the same time make black j15 group stronger.
So l14?]

;B[pj]C[ok , though r11 takes white base away];W[dm]C[unimaginative again, but 25 points solid territory.  now what?

what is white scared of?
Now either cut k12 or k3]
(;B[jh]CR[fj][fk][hj][jj]C[black tries for big upper right corner, but left side stones still dont have 2 eyes

left side stones seem strong with circles stones have good shape]
;W[di]C[exactly the kind of move i overlook.  i can live on left but will be disconnected.  f12 wasnt such a great move after all..]
;B[cj];W[ej];B[bi];W[ak];B[ai];W[ad]C[i must confess i lost respect for white on seeing this

yes less ko threats];B[ae];W[rd]C[...and this.  surely this helps black?

so white attack on left side was a little premature.
this s16 seems an ok move / probe black's response.

with k12 cut black, white is trying to minimize helping black make a moyo]

(;B[rc];W[qc]C[...and again!  i felt i could win if this is how white plays.  but am i  missing something?  is this in fact a good move??  my first thought was r18, but then i changed my mind, for if white lived on the side, the value of k12 would be negated.  so decided to force white to live small in the corner.  was this good thinking?

Black certianly wants to make white live small and make moyo]

(;B[pc];W[qe]C[another apparently stupid move.  or was it?  how should black respond?]

(;B[qb]C[maybe q16 would have been better?

r18 is good]

(;B[qg]C[blind aggression is catching!  i had lost all respect for white by now and foolishly thought i could kill.  would p13 be saner?

there seems not to be any good continuations for black at r8

(;W[pr]C[looks like small thinking, but....
now what?

still it may appear small but it has big follow ups to take away black base]

This should be at least h3 if not j3]

C[good answer];B[bq];W[ar];B[aq];W[cs];B[bs];W[ds]C[shan [2k\]: thx

well, this is why i am 3k.  i cant fight.  or is there more to my deficiencies?  is there some big picture stuff i am not seeing as well?  hope you can guide me....

overall, i think white used attacks on the weak black groups well, perhaps you had too many weak groups at the start and then created more by playing r8 and e6.

So try to not have any weak groups white can attack. 
Overplays need to be punished otherwise white will get away with them, such as pincering r14.

Getting groups cut off at d10 and living small at r8 was what put you behind and the possibly too deep at e6 did'nt help.
Also possibly take the big points first rather than the honte / slow move.

Well hope this helps, sorry i havent play go for a while. mybe play a game on kgs, just email me ;)
