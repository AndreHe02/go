C[Hello (:

first of all, thank you for reviewing my game.

 I submitted this game because I can't find "real" mistakes myself (apart from mv 84 ^^). The style, my opponent played here was (at least in my opinion) quite strange. I tried to handle it it the best I could. It actually felt very disadvantageous for him, but somehow I couldn't really "punish" him. I never really found multipurpose moves and my whole play seemed too straightforward. So even though I won th game in the end, I felt like a played pretty bad and cannot really figure out the reason.

I pointed out a few things, where I had several ideas, but didn't know which is the best choice. I just wrote down, what I thought, so maybe you could also correct my thoughts a bit, because it of course helps with the understanding of the game. Furthermore, I know I have sometimes a very messy style, so I would also appreciate, if you could show me, where I could have played a bit calmer or just easier. (This messy includes my shape as well.)

again, thanks a lot  (:

forfun (hereafter ff): First of all thanks for submitting an interesting game.  I had a good time reviewing it.

All of us play where we do based on our understanding of the situation.  Many times we do not fully understand the choices made by our opponents.  However, if they are about the same strength as ourselves, then experience says that on average their ideas are about as successful as ours.  It is a good thing to try to understand what our opponents try to achieve and whether or not we are successful or unsuccessful in what we set out to do.

Many of White's comments in this game are along the lines of, "Is this a good move?" or "Is there a better play here?"  I do not think this is the right approach.  (For clarity let me add that I constantly do the same thing for my own games!)  No game that is played to completion depends on any single stone.  All games depend on the accumulation of many stones and the resulting interrelationships between them.  The real questions are, "Did I succeed in what I set out to do?"  or "Was my strategy appropriate for this situation?".  In this game White wanted to "punish" Black's "disadvantageous" plays/situation (refer to White's comments above).  However, I did not see that White evidenced a better overall grasp of the situation than Black.  Each side pursued their own strategy.  Each side played some good and some bad stones.  Each side at times played consistently and at other times inconsistently.  I have tried to point out some of the issues for both.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pq];B[fq]C[ff - F3 is an unusual play in this position.  Black normally either plays at D10 on the left or approaches the lower right corner.  It would be interesting to know what White thought about at this point.  It is not vital, because F3 is not a bad play as such.  But it is probably the first time that White has encountered it.  Did White take the time to think about it? :-)]
;W[cj]LB[fc:A][cf:B][qk:E][qo:D][jq:C]C[I was also thinking about A-E, but it seemed kinda disadvantageous for me. If I played A and B, he could use his lower-right corner too well. C seems too low (I don't know about k4) and D has C (or above) as a good follow up move for b. E seemed too passive, but I couldn't really judge it.

ff - Probably no one can really judge it.  It will come down to a matter of style most likely.  The one thing to be a little wary of is that the left side "looks" like the fuseki where the lower Black stones are on C4 and E4 instead of D4 and F3 as they are here.  The situation is different!  What should White think about?
- I think that the left side is more open here.  The lower left corner is not closed as it would be if Black were on C4 and E3.  So there are more invasion points available later.  This may make A and B more interesting.  For example, if White played B and Black answered with a pincer around C10.  White would still have plays at B4, B5, etc. to use in the lower left corner.  Black's pincer would not be as powerful here.
- A Chinese style formation on the right by White is less interesting now.  The Black stone on F3 limits the opportunities for White along the bottom side.  Compare to the case where Black plays at D10 instead of F3.]
;B[cf]
(;W[cn]C[ff - In the case where Black has already played at F3, White might prefer to play at C7 instead of C6.  See the variation...]
;B[bp]C[ff - Black shuts the corner.  Compare this to the situation where Black has stones on C4 and E3.  Here Black has used three stones instead of two.  Of course the lower left is larger but not enough larger to justify the third stone.  Black more or less has to play in at C8 I think.]
;W[en]LB[ej:A]C[I was also thinking about A, but it seemed to me, that he could get easily a lot of influence to the bottom, while i get nothing for it. This is one of these parts where I am very unsure. Did I handle c14 correctly?

ff - White at A (E10) is not interesting.  Why not? It has no natural follow up for the next play.  It is too far away to be a factor on either the top or the bottom side.  I think the exchange of E6 for B4 is very much in White's favor.]
;B[gp]C[ff - This can not be good!  If Black had stones on B4, D4, and G4 he would never choose to play next at F3.  Of course White at G4 next would be painful, but Black can not play this way.]
(;W[kq]C[I thought g4 is a bit too slow and doesn't severely attack my group, so I could prevent him from getting a good extension and make q5/r5 a good move for me. Is the idea correct?
If I play an extension there, is this the right point? I wasn't sure. I am not really good at figuring out the right length for an extension and how close I can go to a black group.

ff - First consider what it means for G4 to be too slow.  How will Black be able to make a good extension from two stones that were too slow in combination?  Second, how will Black make a good extension anyway since White's stone on Q3 is facing up the right side?  Doesn't Black rather want to approach Q3 from the right side rather than the bottom?

The play at L3 looks greedy to me.  White is over aggressive here.  L3 prevents Black from extending at all.  By doing so however, it forces Black to aim at invading the lower right instead.  This is really what White should be seeking here?]
;B[gn]C[ff - So White blocks on the lower side and Black develops upward instead.  Is this what White expected in deciding to play L3?]
;W[qo]C[I wasn't sure whether I could actually ignore g6. But it seemed too early because c14 is quite far away. I thought r5 to be very big.

ff - How big did you consider r5 to be?  It  is undoubtedly a traditional "big point".  However, the important point is - big compared to what?  White takes gote to play here.  Black next plays the long series from E10 through O9, after which White gets sente again.  What did you think of the situation after Black O9?  Is the balance of the game better for White than before White played R5?  If so, then R5 is OK.  If not, then R5 (or the subsequent play) was not OK.

Personally I think that R5 was a mistake in direction because right now the active interaction between Black and White is in the lower left rather than the lower right.  Also the low play at R5 is too greedy in taking a (relatively) little corner territory without protecting the wide extension to L3.  For example, Q5 rather than R5 would strengthen L3 but would leave Black with more play on the right side.]
;B[ej]
(;W[dk]C[right answer? i looked at the shape, but he gbets another outside move, so i can't break through. On the other hand, this "wall" of loose stones was too weak.

ff - The idea that White will respond on the inside and live small in gote should lose the game for White.  Consider that, without losing sente, Black builds a wall that is seven stones high (counting from G4 to E10), fixes up the remaining defects in the lower left corner, and then streaches across the board to O10 half-way taking control over an area of around 30 points in the center.]
;B[fl];W[bo]C[is this one necessary? and if yes, the right one?

ff - You do not say what your reading was when you played it.  Does that mean you played it without reading?  If so, there is no explanation that I can give that will help you.  The next time you will not be able/willing to read again anyway :-)]
;B[co]
(;W[do]C[this one is generally said to be not so good, because it prevents aji in the corner. but I thought the corner is strong because of f3 and g4 anyway and this one would help my group a lot.

ff - If you need to help your group a lot, then your previous play at B5 must have been necessary.  If your group is not in immediate danger, then it is impossible to help it "a lot".  This play does not make a lot of territory.  Remember that making a third eye for a group that already has two, is a waste of time.]
;B[cp];W[bm]C[ff - Following the play by Black at E10, White has added five stones to the this group in order to make about 8 points of territory.  Against this Black's wall points out across the open center of the board.  White has now played more inefficient stones than Black, more than offsetting Black's original slow play in the lower left.]
;B[ko];W[lp]C[ff - Wite agrees with Black that L3 was not a good idea :-)  White has now played two stones L3 and M4 in order to extend four lines form the lower right shimari.]
;B[mn];W[pk]C[right move?

ff - What plan lies behind this stone?  What does White want to achieve?

Locally, what did Black plan to do in answer to P5?  A Black stone there would threaten to attach at either R6 or P3.  P5 is a standard weak point for the small knight's shimari.  So to my eye, M4 was too tight (left too large a gap on the bottom) and Q9 was too loose (created too large a gap on the right).  The combination gives Black a good dual-purpose play in this area.]
;B[nk]C[ff - Referring back to the note on R5, I would rather be Black in this situation than White.  The last few plays have been very much in Black's favor in my opinion.]
;W[jd]C[too hasty, to play here now?];B[qc]
(;W[qd]C[ff - See the variations in relation to the comments on White R14 at the end of this joseki.  This looks like the wrong direction, at least in combination with the joseki that White chooses.]
;B[pc];W[oc];B[ob]
(;W[nc]C[ff - Here too, see the variations for the comments on R14.]
;B[nb];W[mc];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qf]C[did i choose the correct side and the correct moves? i don't really like this one so much,  because it is gote, but it seemed strong in this situation

ff - If you did not like it because it was gote, what did you expect Black to play next?  If you expected Black to play around O12, which is a nearly perfect erasing play against your new wall, why choose this direction/joseki?  If the wall that White built is "strong", it must be strong as part of some future plan.  What would that plan be after Black's next play at O12?  Strong stones should normally be used to attack.  What will White attack in the direction that the wall is facing?]
;B[nh]C[ff - This looks nearly perfect to me.  White should be disappointed.]
(;W[dc]C[maybe too early? ... he could have used the influence later for the center (which he only kinda did, I was just lucky, I think)

ff - Maybe the wrong point!  Why did you choose the attachment at D17 instead of the approach at F17?  See the variations...]
;B[ec];W[eb]C[ff - This seems very submissive and unlikely to relate well to K16.  Other ideas would be C16 or E16.]
;B[cc];W[db];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[cd];B[bd];W[gb];B[hc];W[cb]
;B[bc];W[bb]C[correct moves? especially the cut? it seemed to me afterwards, that it might have been premature to cut there and I should have used the aji of the cut from the outside later (which I kinda did later, but I found out afterwards, that it wasn't so well done).

ff - If you had played C18 without cutting, what would Black do?  Here C16 is a minor tactical question.  The game result can never depend on such a play unless the life or death of a significant group is involved.]
(;B[ab]C[ff - This is a poor idea that White should take advantage of...]
(;W[ba]C[ff - A fundamental mistake by White.  The White group is only six stones long.  White needs to push at H18...]
;B[hb]C[ff - White gives sente to Black for free...];W[ga];B[kc]
C[ff - A fundamental mistake in direction by Black.  This gives White an opportunity to extend the upper right wall and greatly diminish Black's potential in the center in exchange for a couple of points on the upper side.]
(;W[mf]C[right move? or at least right direction? I wanted to treat k16 lightly

ff - Right in aiming for the center.  However, the idea of giving up K16 is not correct.  See the variation...]
;B[kd];W[ei]C[ff - A strange-looking and ugly shape.  It can not be right! :-)  What does White hope to achieve here?  What position is White imagining will result from this play and Black's response, whatever it is?

At this point what are the big questions remaining?
1. How much is Black's center worth - this is the main point.
2. How much is White's right side worth - this is the second point.
3. How much will Black make in the upper left by capturing K16 - this is the third point.
However, there is a possibility for Black to tie 1 and 3 together with a play around M13.  This is a really important point right now.  Thus a play around E11 is from the wrong direction.]
(;B[di]C[ff - White gets lucky...];W[ek]
(;B[fk]C[ff - See the variations...];W[fj];B[dj]C[ff - The proverb says that extending one stone in an unsuccessful ladder costs 7 points.  So Black incurs a 14 point loss on D10 and D11!]

i added a variation once in a while, to show what i thought, i missed
