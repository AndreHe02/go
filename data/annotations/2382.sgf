C[This is a record of a game played at a local tournament.  We each had 50 minutes on the clock.  I played white, but will be sharing this review with the black player, so comments on both players moves would be helpful.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[oq];W[dc];B[po];W[jp]C[I think finishing the upper left with D15 or 
C15 would be better.  If Black then plays 
something like F3 or F4 then K4 or other 
pincer seems good.];B[jd]C[Again, C15 or D15 seem bigger.];W[pj]
C[same as move 6];B[de];W[ch];B[fd];W[qm]C[Responding in upper left is huge.  Also if 
black approaches Q10 from either side you 
can extend on the other side - so a move 
here is not urgent.];B[qg];W[me]C[Bad move by white?  Looking at the SGF 
file now I see that black can slide under the 
two stones at the side to deny them a 
base.  Should I have played R11 or 
something to prevent that before playing 
N15 or around there?  Black's reply to N15 
seems passive.

Answer:  Living in upper right with sente 
(invade at R17) seems best move in this 
quadrant.];B[nc];W[oh];B[cn];W[co];B[dl]C[Odd move - D6 is normal, stronger for 
Black with extension to C10 and attack on 
lower left corner possible follow-ups.];W[nn];B[lq];W[ee];B[dd]

;W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[pp];W[np];B[no];W[mo];B[oo];W[mq];B[lp]
;W[mp];B[mr];W[hf]C[The last 20 moves for both sides seem 
inconsistent.  Both sides jump away from 
the action at odd times.  Move 46 is 
exemplar - lower right corner is unfinished. 
 The last few white moves are begging for 
reinforcements.];B[he];W[ie];B[if];W[ge];B[ff];W[fe];B[hd];W[gh]
C[What was this?  Misread?  E14 or G14 
seem much better.];B[jf]C[G14 and then E14 are great forcing moves 
and should be played first.];W[ib];B[jb];W[md];B[mc];W[kb];B[ja]
C[Maybe J19 (sente) would be an 
improvement.];W[kd];B[le];W[ke];B[lf];W[je];B[lb];W[kc];B[jc]

;W[pc];B[na];W[pb];B[oa];W[pa];B[ma];W[qh]C[In hindsight it seems fairly obvious that, after investing all those stones in the corner, I should have played in there to settle it rather than R12.]
;B[qc];W[qe];B[qd];W[re];B[qa]C[A lot of moves by both sides seem to make 
no sense, like this.  Why beat a dead 
horse?];W[sc];B[df]C[I think D18 first is better.];W[eg];B[cg]
;W[gl];B[ln]C[Don't peep when you can cut (or may want 
to cut in the future).];W[lo];B[db];W[ec];B[jq];W[iq];B[jr]
;W[en]C[Odd - is this attack or defense?  Defend 
with D6 or B5 and then attack seems 
better.];B[cj];W[ej];B[kh];W[og];B[mh];W[mj]C[Is game record incorrect?  Doesn't O14 kill 
Black's upper right corner?];B[jj];W[ki];B[li];W[ji];B[nf]C[I noticed when black played this move that 
had I played there first, I could have saved 
my corner group.  I had felt however that 
the centre was bigger and so I should try 
and keep black on the sides.  Was this 
thinking 'right', or would it have been better 
to make my corner group live?

Answer:  not just save6 white stones but 
White 125 would kill 6 black stones 
(counting captured black stone).  Huge.];W[lj];B[gs]C[Black confused me with this play, and 
others like it.  It seems endgame and small 
compared to many other things black could 
try (like J4, perhaps).

Answer:  This is quite large, although H2 is 
probably a little better.];W[gr]C[This doesn't work here because White 
lacks support.];B[ir]C[But Black doesn't punish White's mistake. 
 Black can play F1 and can't be cut off 
from K2.];W[hq];B[hr];W[fr];B[ko];W[lr];B[nr];W[hs];B[mn];W[kr]
;B[ks]C[Why not L3?];W[kq];B[kp];W[kn];B[ls];W[jo];B[nq]C[Why not L7?]
;W[nm];B[km];W[jn];B[jm];W[lm];B[op];W[ll];B[pm];W[pn]C[Wrong side?  Q8 seems like it might be 
better, in hindsight, but I wanted to ensure I 
had a nice wall to make the side mine.

Answer:  R6 makes the wall without letting 
Black play P6 in sente - reducing White's 
liberties on the two stones to the left..];B[on];W[qn];B[om]

C[Why didn't Black connect?];W[be];B[ef];W[bd];B[bc]C[Cut at G14!  Kills 10 White stones.
[End of comments\]];W[cb];B[bb];W[eb];B[da]C[Recording of game stopped here.  Black played poorly in the endgame, allowing white to defend the sides and centre easily, despite the fact that there appear to be a number of places where black could reduce white's centre territory.  Final score was white win by 69 (75 with komi).]
