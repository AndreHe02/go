C[fleet2010 [5k\]: hi

GL: Hi, I'm Graham Lamburn (topazg) a British 1k and KGS 1d. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can (marked with GL:) and have tried to answer questions and comments, and I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf. I've offered alternative moves and variations where I felt they were noteworthy, and most variations have a comment at the end.

In summary:

1) A couple of the opening moves White played were somewhat slow. Making a stake in the lower right could have been done earlier, but in the game White still played there first, so no harm was done.

2) The near high pincer was played in 3 out of 4 corners, and both cases where White played it, the idea didn't seem to fit with the global context of the board. In the top left, it was perfectly adequate to simple pull back, and the pincer left White in a slightly overconcentrated position. In the lower left a low pincer would have more succesfully balanced Black's global efforts to create large frameworks on the board.

3) The losing part of the game was failing to develop the position White had created on the top side of the board. Having created a thick position with potential to develop towards the centre, White instead played tengen, and was left with a weak group to save and no increase in territory at the top.

I hope that helps, and do feel free to ask me any questions that you may have about my comments!]

(;W[hd]C[GL: Remember that this pincer leaves a lot more aji in F17 with respect to the top side. A low pincer here might be preferable, although simply pulling back is perfectly fine.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]
(;W[nc];B[df]
(;W[fd]C[I think it is passive move.

GL: Not really, as it removes a lot of the aji of F17. You can also hane at E14 when you have H16 in place, but you cannot prevent Black from damaging the top side later. E14 directly is probably better though.

If you intend on approaching at O17, you're actually aiming for a good development on the top, so you can continue the top left joseki with E13 straight away (see variation on move 16). This also makes Black saving F17 less appealing, as White's outside facing thickness will have more power over the centre of the board.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc]
(;W[kc]C[It is not efficient and effective .

GL: Agreed, M16 or even O15 would be more interesting.];B[fq]

(;W[hp]C[GL: It isn't clear to me why you chose the same pincer again on this side - with Black having the stone in the lower right, it feels hard for White to effectively use this stone, which is more commonly used for putting severe pressure on Black from a position of strength. A low pincer would have negated Black's development on the bottom, and pulling back for sente is also an option.]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[hr];W[ck];B[kq]C[After this move, I have no good point .And , Black 's fuseki is sucessful .]

(;W[ch]C[GL: This is much smaller than an approach play in the lower right.]
;B[bg];W[bh]C[White is too slow .

GL: Yes, the lower right is still faster and larger than this area.]

(;W[oc]C[GL: R13 is an urgent move, as it unsettles both Black groups.]
;B[qg]
(;W[jj]TR[pd][df][qf][qg][ph][oi][hn]C[GL: A bit unclear of purpose. The marked stones make it very tricky to make a moyo with this move, and Black also struggles to make a moyo in this area. I've put two suggestions in variations.

As this stone/group came under pressure later on, it is fair to say that this was a costly mistake in the end.]
;B[hj]C[GL: Another move that doesn't make much sense to me.]
;W[jh];B[jf];W[hh];B[ki];W[ji];B[lg]TR[pd][oi]C[GL: Black's moves are beginning to show profit, but White has an interesting tactic.]

(;W[kj];B[li];W[lj]C[GL: Slow, White has no good followups here.]
;B[kn]
(;W[no]TR[hh][jh][ji][jj][kj][lj]C[GL: White does need to restrict Black's development of points, but tenuki from the group in the centre is still likely to be painful as Black has a number of forcing moves.]

;B[ej];W[br];B[dq];W[cp];B[ne]C[GL: Large. At this stage, it is becoming hard for White to catch up his deficit in points. There is a useful tactic on the botom still.]
