C[N: hello
In this game, it seems you chose a wrong direction in the opening and this caused you a lot of trouble. In a way it seems you helped your opponent a lot by forcing him to make his moyo territory. Given the difference in rank, you should have tried to make it harder or to take a little bit more risks to give him the opportunity]

(;W[ei]SQ[ch]C[N: I do not like this move. The more I look at it, the more I think this is the source of much of the trouble you had in this game.

This looks like a 'play on the border of two moyo's' -kind of move,  but here it is black that has the moyo, but white had no moyo yet.

On the left side you have a rock solid position with the marked stone sticking out. This stone is also low. This is not the first play you think of when you want to devellop.]

(;W[cn]C[N: understandable move, but looking at the whole board, you seem to concentrate too much on one side.]
