;B[qd]C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking into my game. I was playing black against a much stronger opponent, despite being 6k just like me, who completely destroyed me. I don't even know what went wrong in this game, which is why I'm asking for help.

The main points I want to ask about, as well as my thoughts on most of the moves will be included as comments. Please try to validate or correct those thoughts, since that is the way I would improve, while avoiding long complicated variations, except in the opening. Also please try to point out typical shapes and the plans, ideas or expectations attached to each suggested move. I'm very much looking forward to learn from your experience.

Hi!

This Joonas, I'm a EGF 1k and reviewing the game. I'll try to answer your questions and point out possible improvements to the moves played. Hope you find the material useful. Let's begin!]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[cg]C[Don't really know what to do here. Played an extension from my bottom corner...

Joonas: Just think of it as a normal knight's move extension, it isn't that much different (slightly more aji). No need to do anything about it here.]
;B[qk]LB[fq:A]C[This looks good. Something like A probably OK as well.]
;W[gq]C[White apparently likes the big knight moves.

Joonas: I was myself quite irritated by them around 5k. But you can think that it's only 2 points better than normal move if it becomes solid territory, but on the other hand doesn't protect the corner as well.]
;B[gc]C[Aiming at either taking the corner or building the top side, making a double wing.

Joonas: Good plan, you're stones seem more spread out than white's.]
;W[ic]C[Now I take the corner.

Joonas: That works, and leaves G17 as good aji stone later. You could also jump. But taking the corner is simple and good.]

(;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc];B[be];W[bf]
;B[de];W[cf];B[bd];W[ee]C[I was wondering for a moment, maybe my opponent thinks this is a ladder. I played a ladderbreaker.

Joonas: It's not a ladder, but a standard way to net the stone so there's less aji later. See continuation.]

(;B[mq];W[lc]LB[md:B][nk:C][cn:A]C[White did not respond to the ladderbreaker. Running out the stone seems unreasonable, so white was right to do so. I try to do something in the area to prevent white from playing some move towards the middle, taking the whole top.

Joonas: White top side is quite low, so reducing it is not urgent -- hard to increase territory much with 1 additional white stone. I'd consider A-C now. The exact moves may not be those, but either play in the empty area on left to reduce white, build moyo with C or similar move, or if you want to reduce white, you might build your own potential with B.]
;B[ge]LB[jd:A][hg:B]TR[dj][ck][dl][cm][dn]C[This move has two problems:

1) It looks like it's trying to save G17, a useless black stone. Would you play G15 if this was the only black stone in the area? Probably not, maybe K16 or some high reducing move.

2) If white attacks these stones and you run, there's a risk that no-man's land at triangled area starts to become white potential.

Therefore, I'd play elsewhere for now, and worry about this area later.

However, this move does activate the aji at D15 (white net no longer works) so it seems like white needs to respond. But still, I would leave this for later.]

(;W[gb]C[Slow but solid. I should play another move, running out into the center. However I chose to approach the last corner, hoping to build a position on the left side and threaten to run out my ladder stone.

Joonas: This does look quite a slow move. Perfect opportunity for black to play elsewhere.]
;B[cn]C[Good!];W[cl]C[white pincers again. Once more I don't know what to do, appart from taking the corner...

Joonas: Taking the corner is quite OK. White is doing low pincers which means there is no great immediate moyo potential.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[bq]C[This is interesting... never seen it before. Maybe I should hane?

Joonas: This looks a bit like a trick play where black can stumble. I'm not familiar with this, but hane at B2 might be possible. However, I don't see it's much better than playing directly at E3, so your move is probably OK.]

(;B[eq];W[br]
(;B[fp]C[Now a huge fight begins. The rest of the game is extremely violent.

Joonas: I'd play E4 instead of this. But getting out is good in any case.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[dn];B[go]C[Good!];W[fq]C[Looks like a bad move on white's part. This is an empty exchange.]
;B[ep]C[Now black could get D5 in sente, and white G3 is not any stronger than before.]
;W[ho];B[hp]C[Here I misread really badly...

Joonas: Yes, just hane at H6, this ladder is quite short to read. I think this is the first place where white gains definite lead.]
;W[ip];B[hq];W[hr];B[iq];W[jq];B[io];W[ir];B[hn];W[hp]C[Very bad for black. However, the game is not lost yet. Just need to save black stones effectively and then start creeping back into the game.]

(;B[hm]C[This might be a greedy move. Overall after the blunder-sacrifice white seems to be winning the game. From now on that will not change. Nevertheless, white seemed quite ahead even before that.

Joonas: Looks doable. However, shape-wise this is heavy, and gives F7 peep. I would avoid such a move. See variations for possibilities.]
;W[in]C[I decide that giving up that stone is not an option.

Joonas: This is a second bad idea. When you have a weak group, you should not save single stones around it. Black shape will unravel quickly if white gets more stones around J6.

A useful question to ask: If I save J5, can I then kill white H3 group? Or does white have to defend and I just got great stones in exchange. In this case, white is already alive on the bottom, so J5 is meaningless as a cutting stone. Let it go! :)]

(;B[jo];W[jn];B[ko];W[kn];B[lo]
(;W[ln];B[mn]C[finally I'm confident enaugh to hane.

Joonas: Looks possible. I would have deviated from this as white.]
;W[mm]C[difficult position]
(;B[nn]C[Solid and secure move. I think white stones now have the disadvantage.]
;W[ll]C[Solid. I'd now return to saving F5 stones.];B[nm]C[This gives you points, but moving first to save your group is likely bigger.]
;W[nl];B[dm]C[trying to make shape for my weak group

Joonas: Excellent, when white played slow O8, you took sente to play here.]
;W[en]C[great move by white. Didn't expect it.

Joonas:]
(;B[fm]C[You're letting white off the hook too easily. See variations.]
;W[do];B[em]C[I was going to say this move doesn't make eyes or get you out, but it does seem like sente, so I'll omit that. :) But you could consider playing this later.]
;W[fn];B[gn]
(;W[cm]C[maybe white could have peeped at my connection before cutting that stone.

Joonas: Looks safer to cut now, and see what black does.];B[gk]
;W[hl]C[white is serious about killing me.

Joonas: Yes, but this move is just silly. If black just plays G8, white has gained nothing.]

(;B[il]C[I respond actively

Joonas: Looks possible, but not sure if it's better than just G8.]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[gl]C[difficult choice. I was afraid trying to delay the connection would run into some hard variations.

Joonas: Yes this gets complicated. But if you play H10, white cannot immediately cut, and H10 stone might be useful for you in your escape. So I'd play that and then continue here. Maybe dan level player would disagree, not sure.]

(;B[gm]C[This is heavy, don't play this to save a few stones.]
;W[hj];B[im]C[this position is starting to become resignable.

Joonas: Yes, the G7 move means you're now 1 move behind in the fight.]
;W[ij];B[kk]C[Good shape.];W[pl]C[Not sente.

Joonas: No :)];B[jj]C[Good! Care for the weak stones.];W[ji]
;B[ki];W[jh]
(;B[hh]TR[gb][fc][ic][lc][ee][cf][cg][jh][ji][hj][ij][hk][cl]
[gl]C[This is wrong time to peep. Look at surrounding white stones, where will this peeping stone escape if you could get the cut? Better to reduce than to peep.]
;W[ii]C[at least my group seems somewhat out of danger now. The top side looks terrible for me though.]
;B[mk]C[Excellent!];W[ml];B[ek]C[bad move. I should try to run while attacking on the top.

Joonas: I disagree, you don't necessarily need to run with your group for now. But L12 push might be good, except after your peep it is less sente.]
;W[fi];B[ei]LB[kd:C][ph:A][ql:B]C[no idea why I played this move

Joonas: Looks like a doable reduction. However, black has more points to gain around Q12 area. You might consider A-C]
;W[eh]
(;B[jd]C[Now I'm trying to run.

Joonas: I'd play 1 more away so you only threaten to pull out your stones, more likely to remain sente.]

(;W[id];B[ie]C[white could just cut.

Joonas: White should not cut, it would help black.]
(;W[kh]C[This seems sente, unfortunately. maybe I should ignore and connect up top?

Joonas: I would not ignore, it would be painful to try to live with this large group afterwards.]
;B[li];W[kf]C[white isn't even content with letting K16 escape and kills everything.]
;B[ke];W[le]C[From now on the game is resignable. I try some desperate things, since many groups aren't settled yet. Unfortunately white is a lot stronger than me and I don't stand a chance trying to kill him.

Joonas: This does look quite bad. Maybe a ko at M16?]
(;B[lf];W[kd];B[jf]C[desperation];W[kg]C[white just calmly connects. There's nothing I can do. The area around H12 is all white's territory.]

(;B[fh];W[gi]C[I turn to the next target.];B[qn];W[lk]C[I don't respond.]
;B[ni];W[mj]
(;B[lj]C[White has punished O11.];W[nj];B[ok]C[No, do not peep here!]
;W[nk]C[I wonder if playing Q8 is an option here. White can live in that case (he probably wouldn't yet). I decide to fix N11 still hoping to attack white's middle group and get a capturing race. Also it seems the cut at N11 is severe, since my group only has one half eye.

Joonas: Exactly, N11 cut is severe, that is why you don't peep at P9. Now you need to go back to N11. Just play there instead of the peep immediately.]
;B[mi];W[oj]C[white doesn't even connect Q8. Also, as usual, white is winning with absolute ease without ever thinking longer than 10 seconds on a move. Now I play a big blunder. In utter desperation I connect the ko, which is unreasonable.]
;B[je];W[jc]C[white even responds here, knowing (after reading 10 seconds) that his group is fine.]
;B[mg]C[I seal off.];W[gh];B[fg];W[gg];B[ff];W[ej]C[there is nothing to be done.]
;B[di];W[dj];B[ci];W[fk]C[white has either two eyes or a connection.]
;B[fl];W[gj];B[dk];W[cj];B[ck];W[bj];B[bo]C[at this point basically just trying to get white to make a mistake]
;W[bp];B[bk];W[bn]C[white doesn't make any though.];B[km];W[lm]

C[White cannot be killed.

Joonas: Yes, this sequence is very much game over.];B[qi];W[rj]
C[I wonder if I could connect R3 here and win the capturing race? Probably not. In any case I'm dead and the game is lost.]
;B[ri];W[on];B[mo];W[qq];B[pr];W[qr]C[I resign.

Joonas: Interesting game. I think the main problem was that you misread the bottom and fell behind, and while trying to catch up, lost a few critical moves in the ensuing fights, which gave white the advantage.

White played very solidly most of the game, although he played a few bad moves, they were not critical to his own shape.

I think the main thing to focus on would be to avoid saving single stones when they offer no immediate benefit, and I'd count the two bad peeps in the same category -- when you have groups to take care of, don't divert your attention to peeps that don't help you.

There were many good moves by black and good timing in several places, so I think you'll definitely improve by playing more games and actively looking for good strategies. Review the few shape ideas, if you can avoid 2-3 inefficient moves in a game, you'll gain about a stone or at least a half.

Thanks and good luck in your games!
