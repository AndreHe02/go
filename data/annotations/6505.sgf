C[Hallo dear reviewer! I appreaciate that you take time & effort to review this game and teach me! A special thank you!
Just follow my questions and I'm fine, if you see big issues I didn't even see, then feel free to mention it, esp. in the fuseki stage. Just review for the white side.

MR: Hi Rene,
I tried to answer your questions - see my comments starting with "MR" in the record. 

I usually try to spot one main topic in the games that I review - in this game it would be "dealing with weak groups". My impression is that you tend to leave weak groups "as they are", maybe hoping that your opponent either does not know how to attack or that he uses too many moves to really capture the groups. In this game, for example, your opponent never dealt with Q10 and used quite a number of moves to capture the upper right corner. 
I am not sure on the right medicine, but my advice would be to play some games against people who are strong in fighting - if then too many of your groups die, you will most likely start to invest some extra moves for the weak groups ... Another idea would be to consciously take pauses in your next games every now and then to evaluate the strength of your different groups.]

(;B[pn]LB[mq:A]C[rs220675: As I understand this is a joseki up to now. Is it possible/good move here not to finish the joseki with A like usual but to play tenuki (like I did)?
And then I don't understand why many very good players don't use this simple joseki, why do they use other ones?

MR: The move "A" is only joseki for white after black o4, see variation.
In the situation given, I would want to play O4 directly as white to build up the lower side. I don't think that tenuki is a good option for white, as black can seal in the white corner with O3.

You can look for the different josekis and variations in Ishida No 2. The reason why your variation is not played by very strong players is that their opponents do not cooperate with Q6 like your opponent ;-)]

(;W[dg]C[rs220675: Is this a good move?

MR: *After* you build up the bottom - yes. It is one possibility to build up the left side while paying the price of giving territory to the opponent in the upper left corner.]
;B[ed];W[dj];B[mp];W[pc]C[MR: I would play O3. If black does not answer you can directly cut with O4, N5.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[pd];B[oe];W[pj]C[rs220675: Is Q10 playable or a mistake?

MR: Did you read out the upper right corner? My first impulse would be to play R15.]
;B[qe];W[jp]C[rs220675: I prefer fast development. Therefore K4 was more imprtant than to secure Q18 which is in danger (actually I didn't recognise it at all :)). Would you have played K4 also or better saved Q18?

MR: K4 is unimportant in my opinion as you allowed black to play N4 before. Locally, F3 looks better. However, this local area is not the hot spot of the game currently. Jumping out with N10 or similar moves seem to be much more important to me. Also, the upper right corner needs an extra white move.]
;B[nq];W[gc];B[qb];W[dc];B[dd];W[ec];B[cc];W[bf]C[rs220675: What do you think of that move? I wanted to keep black under pressure with that move so that black won't live to easy and to quick....

MR: I would prefer to play with the white group at the top, first idea would be F16. The black group is not that weak, black can utilize the white weakness with e.g. F17.]
;B[cb];W[mb]C[MR: ?
White should play with his upper left group. This would also be consistent with the goal you mentioned for move 34.]
;B[lb];W[lc];B[kb];W[ld];B[od];W[pb];B[qc];W[jc]C[rs220675: Any way I can kill the two black stones at L18 or did I just misread the sequence? Could I have made something better out of this fight?

MR: No, the black two stones are not dead. After black K18, white J17, black R16 black has five liberties while white has only four.

N18 was definitively a strange move - extending a "dead" group and make the opponent stronger in the direction of another weak own group ... As mentioned before, playing with the upper left white group directly would have been better, e.g. F16 or K17.]

(;B[ib];W[hb];B[qd];W[ia];B[pa];W[be]C[MR: ?];B[bd];W[ac]C[rs220675: Certainly a mistake to prevent black from living in the corner. Or is it ok? Which move would have been right or which moves would have been right?

MR: I don't think that you can kill the black group - so tenuki is best. 
I think that there is no "one good move" in this situation. One idea would be to play around tengen - to extend the framework in the lower left and to support Q10.]
;B[ad];W[db];B[da];W[fb];B[ef];W[eg];B[ff];W[jj];B[dn]C[rs220675: Here I have no idea what to answer black. I answered at C6 which I consider bad because it helps the weak stone to deveop. Now I would prefer C8 as an answer. What do you think?

MR: I can understand that you want to rob black the base. As you already mention yourself, it would be better to do this without attaching, e.g. with C5. One problem with this is the black option of a double approach with F3 - if you defend the corner afterwards, black "separates" K4 which leads to large scale fighting. An alternative is the simple move F4, see the "standard joseki" as a variation.]

Locally, F13 does not help with respect to shortage of liberties.]

;W[eq];B[do];W[cp];B[gn];W[fp];B[jn];W[io];B[in]C[MR: Black resigned.

I feel that this is a strange stage to resign for black, first one usually resigns when it is ones own move and second this is not a situation where "something" was just decided. It is true that the game is much better for white, but there are still some areas to start trouble - a) there are some forcing moves against the lower right corner, b) there are squeeze options starting with G13, c) a caping move N10 forces white to act with Q10 with the option for black to "get something".]
