C[Hello,

I am Bernd, 1d from Germany, HonFu in the GTL and on KGS and other places.

This game was played in the German internet league (in one of the lower classes). In the end I managed to win this game, but I felt at some moments that my position was maybe not so good, at least ambiguous. Also there seemed to have been opportunities for my opponent to punish me, which he let slip. So I'd like to have you take a look on it and tell me, where I could have played better, or where I should have taken a blow. Please do also comment my own analysis.

Thanks a lot!

[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer.  My comments will be marked like this.  Looking at the whole game, you played well overall and deserved to win.  However, I feel you have a tendency to try too hard to get the big points, which sometimes causes you to neglect proper defense.  There is a fine balance here; pushing for a bit of extra profit or efficiency is part of Go strength, but can be overdone.  Try to also appreciate the long term value of thick defensive moves.]

C[Hon: Here I assumed black's H3, but ...];B[di]C[Hon: ... black took this point, and now I was not sure what to do about it.]
(;W[qi]C[Hon: I took this spot, because I thought it was more important than H3. Please see variation for my reasoning and tell me, if I am wrong or not.

[EV\] In the normal joseki, B plays H3 and W pincers at D11.  So when B switches to D11 to get a better result on the side, a W play at H3 seems natural and good.]
;B[hq];W[gc]C[Hon: My stones on D5 ended up drifting. It felt like the only choice to me, for not getting overconcentrated on one side of the board, but this happens in a lot of my games, having one weakish groups like that which is attacked and somehow lives.

Often people slightly stronger tell me, I should not leave a weak group like this, but sometimes it seems hard not to.

[EV\] Yes, the three W stones are now doing very little and could even become a liability at some point.  I would attach at C3 and start to make a base for them.  W play in this area is example #1 of the tendency I noted in my opening comments.  Here I cannot say it is necessarily bad, as W did take large points, and the W stones are not yet weak, but I would not play this way.]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[np];W[pn];B[pq]
(;W[qo]C[Hon: In the post-game comments it was said that I should have played R3.

[EV\] No, this move is correct -- see variation.];B[qq];W[cq]
;B[cr];W[ce]C[[EV\]];B[jp]C[[EV\] This B move is too territorial and not as big as it looks.  C4 is much larger and more urgent.]
;W[gl];B[kc]C[Hon: This move I considered a mistake.];W[qf]
C[Hon: I thought, black should have played on this side.

[EV\] R14 and a move around L17 seem about equal.  I think C4 is still more important than either of these moves.]
;B[gn];W[go];B[cp];W[co];B[bq];W[ch]C[Hon: This would not be the normal attacking move maybe, but I thought, c13 was just too close to my strong corner, and with this move he would - playing honte - end up in gote.

[EV\] The next few plays around here strengthen B, but letting B get C13 would also be unsatisfying.  I do not see a great move for W here.  Sliding all the way to B11 might be worth considering.]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[bj];W[bh];B[en]C[Hon: But he did take gote and try to attack me instead.

This is the normal progress of most of my games, and I wonder if it is really good or how I could prevent it without losing sight of whole board development.

[EV\] W gave B a few extra moves in this corner, so should not expect too much.  Just defend and keep an eye on the C9 aji.]
;W[eo];B[gm];W[hl];B[fl]C[Hon: Here the commentators felt, that F9 was important for white, but I looked for a way to get out of here in sente so I could play on P15.

[EV\] F9 looks absolutely essential to me, so important that no other move is worth considering.  W is starting to get very thin here, and F9 is the vital point for the balance of power in the center.  Assuming B answers, W should invest yet another move to protect against cuts like J6 or J7.  After strengthening the center, W could look forward to placements like C9 to attack B.  This is example #2 of the W tendency to underestimate the value of thick defensive moves.]
;W[jo];B[ko];W[jn];B[kn];W[ip]C[Hon: This is vulgar, but I thought it might help me to end this in sente.]
;B[iq];W[km];B[kp]C[Hon: But maybe it was not so sente after all? (See variation.)

[EV\] Sometimes it is best to just defend passively, preserving aji for later.  Here W forces B to take territory, but does not really protect the weakness, as B still has a very dangerous cut.]
;W[oe]C[Hon: At this move I thought, he'd either defend, then I could still think about F9, K8 or the likes, or it would happen like it did in the game.

I missed, that black could have cut on K7, and have no idea, if that would have meant trouble.]
(;B[fk]C[[EV\] B plays a vital thick move, instantly making his side group strong, immune from attack.  K7 is now a very dangerous cut.]
;W[nc]
(;B[od]C[[EV\] This does not work very well for B.  W will get something here, but lets see if B has better options.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[of]
(;B[me];W[ob]
(;B[pb];W[nb];B[qc];W[ld]C[Hon: Here for the first time I felt really ahead.

[EV\] Yes, W outplayed B here.];B[hc];W[gd];B[gb];W[fb];B[hd]
;W[le]C[[EV\] Good, B is in trouble here.];B[hb];W[ge];B[mg]
;W[lf];B[og];W[pg];B[oh]
(;W[lb]C[Hon: I wondered how black would handle this double attack, but ...]
;B[lg];W[je];B[jg];W[if]C[Hon: ... he just sacrificed the top.

I thought this was too easy for white, and too much profit, but the lower left was still not settled, so I could not be completely at ease. What do you think?

[EV\] This capture is certainly enough to win the game, provided the large W group below does not actually die.]
;B[qk]C[Hon: When he invaded here ...];W[pk]C[Hon: ... I went for the outside, risking he would take my points on the right away, because I felt, strength to the center would be crucial for both of our weak groups.

[EV\] Good idea.];B[qm];W[pm];B[rl];W[pl];B[qj];W[pj];B[pi]
C[[EV\] B cannot expect this to work, S11 is necessary and would be awkward for W to answer.]
;W[ri];B[ro];W[qp]C[Hon: This was a moment of stinginess, which seems really bad now. I should have just cut at S9.

[EV\] Yes, this move loses points.];B[rp];W[rk];B[lm];W[ll]
C[Hon: Again the stinginess - black must not connect his weak group. If he had cut at K7, I might have been in trouble (what do you think?), but ...

[EV\] W has a comfortable lead by my count, and K7 would give B a real chance to stage an upset, so just defend and avoid trouble.  Example #3 of trying too hard and underestimating the danger of a thin position.]
;B[kl]C[Hon: ... he cut here, and everything remained manageable.]
;W[jm];B[kk];W[hj];B[ig];W[ml];B[mm];W[gi];B[fh];W[hg];B[hh]
;W[gh];B[hf];W[gg];B[he];W[gf]C[Hon: This move maybe was the most dangerous in the game. If the capturing race at the top became bad for me, it would have been game losing. But not playing G7 was also hard, so ...]
;B[jf]C[[EV\] This move and the next hurt B more than W, losing liberties.  Since B must play L18 to have any chance, he should play there directly and keep these forcing moves in reserve.  Preserving K16 sente could let B live above.]
;W[ie];B[kd];W[ke];B[kb];W[lc];B[md];W[mf];B[nf]
(;W[kg]C[Hon: ... relying on this aji here I hoped to do alright, and as the game went, it was. But maybe you see a way for black to win the game? Or a way for me to handle my trouble without that much danger?

This kind of rather large life and death problems are hard for me to solve. Maybe you have some hints about how to look at that kind of position?

[EV\] This move aims at capturing the outside, but loses liberties.  Capturing the inside seems easier -- see variation.  However, it looks like capturing the outside also works.  I have no sage advide on this sort of position -- it eventually comes down to reading ability.  No further comments.]
;B[kh];W[kf];B[jh];W[lh];B[ni];W[li];B[jj];W[mj]C[Hon: Now, since there's a lack of liberties on this side, best black could hope for would be living with the top, but with all his center dead it would not be enough to win.

Basically this is the end, the last few moves do not change anything about the result.]

)
(;W[mc];B[ng];W[jb]C[[EV\] I think B has no answer to this move.  In a capturing race, the B liberties disappear quickly.]
))
(;W[lg];B[mh];W[ki]C[[EV\] This looks like a strong attack.  Even if W does not kill, the attack will let him consolidate territory on the right side and the center.  The cut at K7 is no longer much of a worry.]

(;B[nb];W[mb];B[mc];W[na];B[md];W[nb]C[Hon: In the game I was worried, what would happen if black chose this variation, but ...]

(;B[nb];W[mb]))
(;B[mc]C[[EV\] Sometimes this move protects against getting cut, or at least minimizes damage.]

(;W[md];B[ne];W[lc];B[mb];W[lb];B[na]C[[EV\] Very good for B, so W must try something else.]
)))
(;B[nb]C[[EV\] Simplest move to consider.];W[ob];B[pb];W[od]
;B[pc];W[mb];B[oa]C[[EV\] This looks playable for B.  However W connects, the B stone at L3 is far from dead, and B will get sente to cut at K7.]

(;W[np];B[id]C[Hon: ... black ends up with a large double wing formation, and I only have one real position and a weakish hoshi stone on D16.

I did rather feel this than read it, but for those whole-board development reasons I played like in the game.]
