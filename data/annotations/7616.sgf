C[dawid963 [3k\]: hi gg
hi im dawid, it was an even game, but suddenly my opponent made a beautiful attack an i lose a big group, without even chance to save that.

please focus on fuseki, and our  middle fight

If you have any further questions, feel free to send them to me. I hope this helps.

Overall white played well this game, but not noticing that the group in the top left could be cut off after running out of eye space resulted in a big group dying and losing.]

(;W[dn];B[fo];W[cr];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm]LB[ck:B][cl:A]TR[ce]C[In my mind the most important thing to notice here is that black is crawling on the second line so A and B are the right moves to keep black low and flat with a bad position. Also A and B connect to C15 so black is pushing from behind, very bad for black.]
(;W[fm]CR[hn][jp][gr]LB[cl:A][br:B]TR[ep][eq][cr]C[Putting pressure on the 3 black stones with F7 is the wrong idea since they are out in the middle and very safe. Black can play any of the circle moves and easily strengthen his shape. Black has A and B to live so he can severely pressure the three white stones on the bottom with a move around f2.]

(;B[ho];W[go];B[mq]TR[oq]C[At this point I would play P3 as white without hesitation. Enclosing a corner is a very big move, and it makes the black group on the bottom side look extra weak.]
(;W[cc]LB[oc:B][oq:A]C[C17 is not a normal follow up for white when white plays first in the corner.  It would be more typical to play a second approach move

Basic fuseki strategy suggests that enclosing an open corner and playing a kakari to the 3-4 point, A and B, are both bigger than C17.]
