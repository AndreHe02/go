C[First, thank you for reviewing my game.
Second, I am white (Chinul)
Please do not spare my feelings.  I know I have a lot to learn and so harsh comments will not offend.  It is part of learning.

One main issue I see is both players following the "two inch rule".  This means you feel compelled to play your stone less than 2 inches from your opponent's last stone.  In this game, at move 60, there are only 2 stones on the entire right side of the board and 58 stones on the left side.  This means a lot of small, low value moves are being made while large areas of the board remain unclaimed.
Often, the best move is somewhere else on the board, not right next to your opponent's last stone.  You need to look at the whole board when chosing your next move, not just at the local situation.   There will be times when you could save 2 or 3 of your stones, but there is a move on the opposite side of the board that is worth more than those 2 or 3 stones.   When that happens, let the stones die and play the more important move. Don't be afraid to give up small groups of stones and let them die when saving them would cost too much time and effort.

The second main problem for white is allowing black to push into white's territory too easily.  Black manages to push into white's top side territory and kill a large group of white stones.  Black also pushes into white's center territory too easily.

Study contact fights.  Study how to fight them well, but also study when to stop fighting and move somewhere else.]
;B[pp];W[dp]C[My interest is mainly to know general errors in thinking, to know what I need to study and focus on to improve]
;B[cq]SQ[qc][cc]C[What is the best way to stop this slow crawl down the side from white?

This move should allow black to capture this corner.  At the same time, white should be able to build a wall facing one side. White should decide now which direction would be best for this wall since white's next move determines the direction of the wall.  Playing D3 means white wants a wall facing the lower side and playing C4 means white wants a wall facing the left side. This early in the game, there isn't much reason to prefer one choice over the other.

Black will only gain a few point of corner territory here, while white builds a strong wall.  So, this is not the best choice for black this early in the game.  If black really wants a secure corner, then playing this move at either of the squares would secure a corner without giving white a wall.]

C[Playing at the square is better for securing black's group.]
;W[fq]C[Nice shape.];B[bm];W[ck]C[Locally, this is a good move.  Overall, however, it is not.  This is still the opening and the entire top half of the board has no stones yet.  White's stones in the lower left are secure and black's group is alive, so there is not need to play in this corner right now.  White should take Sente and play this stone in one of the upper corners.]
;B[bk];W[bj]C[White can't kill black's stones so surrounding them doesn't accomplish much.]
;B[bl];W[cl];B[aj];W[cj];B[bi]
(;W[ci]C[White should play elsewhere.
See Variation.];B[bh];W[ch];B[bg];W[cg]C[Crawling along the second line like this is very bad for black. White at least gets a huge wall out of this exchange.  So, while this isn't the best series of moves for white, it is not nearly as bad for white as it is for black.]

;B[ef];W[dg];B[ff];W[ge]SQ[fe]C[Let the marked stone die and move on to something more worthwhile. The marked stone is cut off from white's other stones.  Trying to save this stone probably won't work, and will give black a chance to get stronger in this area.  At the end of the game, this marked stone is one of 11 dead stones in this area.  So, white played 10 more stones trying to save this one and still failed.  Much better to cut your losses now and move on.]
;B[fd];W[fg];B[gf];W[he];B[hf];W[ie];B[gd]
(;W[hd]SQ[ie][he]C[This is not a good move locally.  Before this move, white has an unsecure group with 4 liberties.  After this move, white still has an unsecure group with 4 liberties.  So this move doesn't improve white's position at all.
Another way to tell this is a bad move is the fact that it makes an empty triangle (the marked stones).  Whenever your are about to play a stone that makes an empty triangle, pause and look over the board again.  Making an empty triangle is usually not the best move you could make.  In general, making an empty triangle is only a good idea if a group of your stones is surrounded stones and you need to make eyes.

This is also not a good move globally.  The entire right half of the board has only one stone, and that is black's.

(;W[ph]SQ[if][hf][gf]C[Don't keep crawling along the side with black.  White doesn't need to make these stones stronger, they are already secure. White can't expect to make much territory in the center because of the marked black stones.  So, white should take Sente and play on the bottom side.
See variation];B[pj];W[nj]TR[hh]SQ[pn][nq]C[White appears to be trying to close off the center.  Trying to enclose a large area in the center is usually a waste of time. The squares are both better moves for white.  Notice that the right side square is on the 4th line.  This is because of black's stone at Q10.  If white really wants to try making territory in the center, then the triangle is a better way to go about it.]

(;W[oh]TR[ng]SQ[pg][ph]C[Making an empty triangle is bad.  If you want to secure the territory around N17, then the triangle is better.
