C[Reviewer: Julian Richardson, julianr@dai.ed.ac.uk, 4 kyu.  I am colic (white) in this game.  I am particularly interested in comments on the beginning of the game.  I have lost games both because I have allowed my opponent too much of the corners and sides, and because I've given my opponent a large center territory.  I tried to keep a balance here, yet found myself behind by mid-game.  Please disregard the disaster at the end.     Thanks.]

;B[qj];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb]C[I am not particularly fond of this joseki where white dives in at Q18
after the kakari. It seems to slow to me, and I would prefer to play say K16 instead.
If you do dive in, then I think you need to play K16 or L16 straight afterwards
because you have strengthened his corner formation enough to put your stones
in danger. If you run to save them he is going to make lots of thickness as
he pushes you.];B[qc];W[ed]MA[kd][kc][ld][jd][jc]C[I think that you can't tenuki here and must play at one of the
marked squares instead.];B[kc]C[This is correct. Black now has a splitting attack.]
;W[ic];B[gc]MA[ic][ed][nc][pb]C[I think L15 is much better. It is a splitting attack on the two marked
white groups.];W[cc]C[Now there is a fight and black has a lot of weak stones on the top line.]
;B[de]MA[kc]C[Maybe black can play D17 instead. I'm not sure, but this way
weakens the G17 stone and thereby strengthens the J17 stone and
white's attack on the marked stone. With so many weak groups it
is a little hard to read what is going to happen now!];W[dd]
;B[be]CR[cf]LB[cf:A][ce:B]C[This formation is vulnerable to a peep at A. B is much better.]
;W[bd];B[ce];W[bc]C[This is not a good exchange for white, I think. He has given black too much thickness
which he should now use by extending.];B[di]LB[dn:A][ff:B]C[This is the standard size of extension but probably too narrow for the
fuseki. Other possible moves which spring to mind are A or B. I
particularly like B because it is strengthening the top side and threatening
to make a big moyo. Note that after B, D11 certainly looks to small an
extension, which argues again that a larger extension would be better.]
;W[cm]MA[be][ce][de][cd][di]C[This is a good white move. He now makes the marked balck group look
very small and overconcentrated, and he builds a double-wing
formation which is an excellent thing to do. Mind you, O4 is a bit
high for a double-wing... black is undercutting from the right... so
there is some work to be done.];B[fq]C[In view of black's undercutting from the right, this looks OK. White
should pincer now.];W[eq]C[OK, that looks perfectly reasonable.]
;B[fp];W[fr]LB[ip:A]C[This is not good. White should capitalise by pincering at A.]
;B[gr];W[iq];B[er];W[dr];B[fs];W[lq]LB[oq:A]C[Better is A. Anyway, by pincering too late, black has got an eye and can
run comfortably.];B[nr];W[oq];B[or];W[pp];B[qq]C[ colic 14k*: is entering byo-yomi]
;W[ie]C[Bravo.];B[ge];W[ee];B[ef];W[ke];B[jd];W[id];B[je];W[jf]
C[ iguana 12k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[ld];W[jc]LB[le:A]C[I think white at A is much better.]
;B[kd]C[Urgh, *dango*!];W[lb]LB[le:A]C[No. Black won't be able to live on the bottom edge. You need to box him in and
protect your cutting points. So play A and fight.];B[le]C[Now black has comfortably connected.]
;W[ig]LB[kb:A]C[Connect underneath at A.];B[ff];W[ne]C[Good.]
;B[ng];W[lf];B[kf];W[kg]LB[mf:A]C[Why not play at A and force black to run. Even if you don't kill you should get
some thickness and strengthen your own stones.];B[mf];W[lg]
;B[me]C[Black is winning now.];W[kb];B[ck];W[oj]C[Good idea. Making a central moyo. Difficult, but if it works
white could still win.];B[mi]C[Good.];W[ph]LB[mg:A][nf:B][nh:C]
C[Better to cut with the sequence A B C.];B[qh];W[mj]C[This looks good.]
;B[ho]C[ kaf 8k*: Starting observation.];W[io]LB[jo:A][jn:B]
C[I recently read a proverb "withdraw to make territory". The contact move makes black
stronger. Better to play one stone away at A or B. Black will probably cut now and cause
a fight.];B[pg]MA[ng][mf][me][le][kf][kd][kc][jd][je][ld]C[Could be important. I guess black is ensuring his marked group is connected
to the right hand side and also ensuring some territory. May not be
necessary but it is safe.];W[li];B[in];W[hn];B[ip];W[jo];B[hp]
;W[jp];B[hm];W[jn]MA[gn]C[Play on the marked square instead.]
;B[gn]LB[jl:A][jk:B]C[Now black is 100% safe. White should not play a big move like A or B.]
;W[jl];B[ok];W[pk];B[cq]C[Hmm, looks good.];W[dq];B[cr]C[ colic 14k*: has entered byo-yomi again]

[dr][dq][eq][dp]C[White can't really win this ko because after filling in at C6,
black will get the first move in the capturing race and kill the  marked group. White can probably save his triangle-marked
group though so it is worth playing the ko, I guess.];B[nf]

The white group in  the top left corner is dead. Black wins, I think. I'll  try to finish the game quickly.]
