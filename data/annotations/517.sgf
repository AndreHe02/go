C[Hello, this is Bill Shubert (wms 4k* on NNGS). I'm commenting this game at the request of kwang, who played b.

Usually you want people to comment games that you lose, because you learn best by having your mistakes pointed out to you. In this game, b won, so mostly I've pointed out w's mistakes...sorry about that!]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[pk];W[dj];B[jp];W[nc];B[nd];W[md]
;B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[lc];B[qg];W[jd];B[jj];W[fq]C[F3 a bit slow I think.

H3 would be better. Or an invasion around R5 or something.]
;B[hq];W[gd]C[G16 not a great defensive move. I'd prefer D17 because that would protect the corner and the top side.]

;B[qn];W[qr];B[pr];W[qm];B[rn];W[ps];B[os];W[qs];B[nr];W[ro]
;B[pm];W[sn];B[sm];W[so];B[rm];W[ql]C[R8 is bad. The stone at R7 is very heavy. Adding another stone to it just means you will lose twice as much when they die.]
;B[pl];W[bc]C[A17 strange. I prefer B15 if you want to defend this corner.]

;B[fe]C[I probably would have captured instead of playing F15. A ladder always leaves bad aji hanging around. Probably better to get rid of it. Besides, b has a strong lead, doesn't need to worry about losing a couple of points around F15.]
;W[fn];B[pb];W[on];B[pn];W[lp]C[M4 isn't that great. b can easily seal it off. There is no room to live here and you will end up helping b build a wall.

I think playing K6 would be better, since it can eascape out easily and can reduce well by threatening to attach to P6.]

;B[ke]C[Filling at Q13 is probably bigger than this. Because w q13 leaves w with two entry points into b's territory, this is an urgent move.]

;W[br];B[gr];W[fr];B[ij];W[pi];B[qi];W[qh];B[rh];W[ph]C[w needs points! Filling at Q12 is bad, W should take the risk and play S11 instead. Basically, when you are behind, you must take risks!]
;B[ri];W[ko];B[jo];W[kn];B[km];W[ln]C[M6 makes an empty triangle, almost always a bad move. Before you ever make this shape stop and think if it is really a good idea or not. Here w is dead no matter what, but if w really wanted to fight it out, N5 or something would make better shape than M6.]
;B[mn];W[mo];B[kp];W[lo];B[nn]C[O7 leaves some uncomfortable cut points. I think making a nice solid shape with N7 would be better.

The stone at O2 guarantees that w can't make two eyes.];W[mm]
;B[no];W[ml];B[lq]C[M3 is not important. w is dead anyway. M8 would be a better move.]
