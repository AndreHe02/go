C[Hi reviewer,
thanks in advance.
I think my weakness lays in the part between the opening and the middle game. I don't know when to take points or influence.
On the other hand I loose a lot of points in the endgame.
Any advice on my many mistakes or my common mistakes are very welcome.


Hi Peter,

I think the best "field" to improve for you is the opening. You made some mistakes during the opening, that is also why it was difficult for you to catch up later.
Of course you think, that the problem is later at the end of the opening and the beginning middle game. But that is only, because it is the moment you realize that something is not right. The mistakes were made before.
So here are some guidlines for the opening:
1. Corners fist, then sides, then center
2. Choose widest side to play/form moyo/invade.
3. Big move lays in corner.
I think especially the second guidline is helpful to choose the right move during the opening. Try to follow this principle in your games. I bet you will improve rapidly!
If you have further questions regarding your game, feel free to contact me.

Best regards,

C[This is a move not following the opening principles I suggested.
"Choose widest side to play/form moyo/invade."
That means playing A or B (also to prevent a black double wing formation) or C.
Because Black already played on the right, it is not so good to play there.]
;B[ci]C[Black is following the opening principle nicely.];W[jq]
C[Good move! Also following the principle.];B[hq]
(;W[mq]LB[nq:A]C[A is possible and should be considered. See possible variations.]
;B[mo]
(;W[or]LB[pr:A]C[12 - Is this correct or better on M4 or K5?

I think A would be best. M4 is a bit overconcentrated and K5 is difficult because of a peep (see variation).]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[iq]
(;W[jr]C[It is better to get out instead of beeing shut in. See variation.]
;B[ko]
(;W[qr]LB[qq:A]C[This move is better on A.];B[mp]LB[jd:C][cn:D]
[rp:B][lq:A]C[I would not answer this move. White can live with A or B. So better to play a big move somewhere else, like C or D.]
;W[lq];B[jd]C[Now Black got the big point...];W[ec];B[mc];W[qn]
LB[hc:A]C[White can attack the top formation with A. This move also makes some territory.
Attacking and making territory at the same time is very good style.]
;B[ql];W[qp];B[pn];W[cg]LB[hc:A]C[Better on A.];B[fi];W[ck]
;B[cm];W[cq]LB[ck:A][cm:B]C[If you want to go in the corner, you should do so without the A/B exchange.
Because of B it is usually more difficult to live in the corner.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[do];B[cn];W[dr];B[eq]LB[er:A]
C[Black should have played this move on A, after which White would be enclosed in a small corner.]
;W[er];B[fq];W[gs];B[ir]
(;W[is]LB[di:A][ei:B]C[This move seems like an endgame move to me. The corner should be alive without connecting (see variation).
So it would have been a possible to break into Black's moyo with A or B.]
;B[bi]LB[di:A][ei:B][hi:C]C[Because of the additional Black stone A and B aren't severe anymore.
Black has a big center moyo. White needs to reduce it.
Starting with C should be best. Later cutting A or B might be possible.]
(;W[hc]C[Locally very good, but reducing Black's center moyo is more urgent.]
;B[pf]LB[hi:A][ek:B]C[Black is increasing his moyo...
I would still try to start with A.
Pulling out on B is quite heavy and risks to loose the hole group.]
;W[ek];B[gk]C[Ouch!];W[bp]C[Not necessary. This is an endgame move. Black is not in danger.]
;B[gr]C[Slow.];W[hs]C[Again not needed.];B[qm]
(;W[di]LB[hi:A][hk:B]C[56 - Trying to make live for C9 and E9 or are there other more important moves?

It's good to not answer Black's move on the bottom right.
But I would prefer to play from the outside, because that does not risk the hole group. And you can use the strength you build on the outside to attack the top.]
;B[dh];W[dj];B[dg]C[Your group is very weak inside Black's moyo and you also hurt your top left group.]
;W[em];B[en];W[eo]LB[gl:A]C[You need to get out!
Better to play A.];B[fn];W[dm];B[dn];W[fm];B[gm];W[ei];B[eh]
;W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[cf]C[White lives very small, but Black gets a good return on the top left.
So living inside Black's moyo was not a good choice. Better to reduce from the outside.]
(;W[rn]LB[nd:A][jo:B]C[Black's center moyo is still pretty big. White may reduce with A or trying to live inside starting with B.]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[pr];W[qf];B[qg]LB[nb:A][me:C][oe:B]C[If you want to jump into the center moyo, you have to do it right away. A move like 'A' just solidifies Black. White may try B or C.
Or you try to live inside like in the variation after move 73.]
;W[nb];B[mb];W[ee];B[ef];W[fh];B[gi];W[gh];B[ge];W[hh]LB[ih:A]
[jh:B]C[A very heavy move. Black is not su much in danger. So it is better to play lightly, for example A or B.]
;B[fe];W[me]LB[nd:B][oe:C][kh:A]C[90 - There is too much black influence to the center, I wanted to jump into it, was this move good for that? Alsoo trying to connect with the 3 whitestones in the center or make live in the center.

Your move is to far away from the three white stones and it is also not connected to the top right (Black can cut).
So you should either play A and try to live inside. Or you should play moves B or C which are connected to the top right group.]
;B[ne]C[And here is the cut...];W[nf];B[oe];W[jb]C[94 - making some points.

Black is leading with 20 to 30 points, this won't be enough.]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[de];W[ed];B[dd];W[dc];B[ce];W[bd]C[102 - defending the corner. Still now 40 points behind.]
;B[be];W[ii]LB[ie:A][kh:B]C[You should play more lightly. You could for example peep at A first and then B to make some space for creating eyes.]
;B[hl];W[ob]LB[kh:A]C[You should stick to one strategy. Try to live in the center.
Playing some stones in the center and then turning elsewhere won't win the game. If Black plays somewhere around A next, you won't have a chance to live there.]

What if Black plays at A? But the idea is good!]
(;B[nc];W[of]C[126 - same purpose as move 124];B[lb]LB[kb:A]
[kc:C][pe:B]C[B is better then A.
But locally instead of A, I would play C.]
