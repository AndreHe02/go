C[Hello, my name is Michal and I play for about half a year now. I'm 11k on KGS and this is a game from there. I'm black, so please review that and mistakes of white I didn't see. Thanks!

MB> Hi Michal, my name is Miron. I'll prefix my comments with MB> (MB are my initials) so it's easy to tell who wrote each paragraph.]

;B[pm];W[oo]C[This doesn't seem like a joseki, so I tried to get a better result. Did I made a good move at p6? Is there a better move?

MB> P6 looks OK to me.];B[on];W[pp]
(;B[pn]C[This shape looks heavy. I wonder what if W invaded now at q10/q11...

MB> Connecting at Q6 seems bad to me (two empty triangles, if you want a reason :-) ).

MB> I'd rather atari at O5 instead (see variations at move 14).]
;W[no]C[MB> White got the important point of O5 himself.];B[qi]
C[MB> Right now, black is a little overcrowded (both locally, there are five stones at Q6 reinforced by a very close stone at R11, and globally - most of his stones are on one side). To be fair, white has deployed all of his stones on one side, so it's not that bad.

MB> In this situation, I think the instinct of doing something to provide a base for the Q6 stones is correct. It's just that the global result isn't so good.]

(;B[af]C[MB> This is not really necessary. White got a terrible result here (closed in the corner, one stone - F17 - hanging against black's wall). Black is doing great, he has a great wall. I'd use move 33 to extend. See variation.]
;W[bd];B[jd];W[dj]C[Any general comments on my fuseki?

MB> See previous comments and variations.];B[jj]C[I wonder if tengen was right here. I works in all directions, and since I have lots of infuence on the top and the right, it makes sense to me. What do you think?

MB> It's OK.];W[nn]C[MB> Auch.]
(;B[fi]C[Was ignoring o6 right?

MB> This is way, way to defensive. You're treating your sphere of influence as territory. Don't do that! The idea of your tengen stone was similar to the idea of my F9 stone in an earlier variation. Especially after O6, you need to go deeper inside white's sphere of influence (reduce it - there is room for invasion, but in this situation reductions are bigger, since they also enhance your influence, WITHOUT creating weak groups that you have to worry about).

MB> See variations for what I would try.];W[cg];B[cf];W[fp]
(;B[jm]C[I think that was bad, it would be better to protect the wall on the left side with something like e13. Am I right?

MB> In this situation, I would try to attack the D10 stone. It would have helped if the F11 stone was at F10 - see my previous comment about F11 being too defensive. But I would still try to attack - see variation.]
;W[fh]C[Now it doesn't look good...]
(;B[eh]C[Was that an overplay? I though white couldn't live inside...

MB> I would have simply played at F11, keep white separated and black connected. See variation.]
;W[fg];B[eg];W[ef]
(;B[ee]C[MB> see variation.];W[ff];B[dg];W[fe];B[fd]C[MB> I'd rather connect at E11 to make sure white doesn't give me any trouble by cutting there, then go after the D10 stone and surrounding area. 

MB> White got himself some kind of wall on the F line (F12 - F15) and while he can still be attacked, there's not much hope for black territory around there if he lives (which he probably will, if you attack without strengthening weaknesses like E11 first).

MB> So that's why I'd try to remove the E11 cut and focus on the D10 stone area. It looks more profitable right now.]
;W[gd];B[gc]C[Shouldn't I just protect e16?];W[ed];B[de];W[fd]
C[MB> I would still suggest E11 and then going for the D10 stone instead of move 58.]
;B[gb];W[he];B[jf]C[MB> J17 seems better instead. Or, to sound like a completely broken record, E11.]
;W[hc];B[hb];W[fb];B[fa];W[ic];B[ib];W[jc]C[When is the time to play from the other side? Should I play l17 here or should I play sooner/later?

MB> The question is not from which side to play, but whether to crawl or not. In most cases, this one included, you shouldn't crawl. You can still strengthen your former wall by connecting on the other side (E11 ;-) ) and then seek profit elsewhere. Crawling just pushes white into your sphere of influence, while converting it into his sphere of influence. Before you started crawling, that group was still attackable. After your crawling, it's much stronger.]
;B[jb];W[kc];B[mc];W[kd];B[je];W[kb];B[ja]C[MB> Why? This is a completely wasted move. You get an eye, but do you really need it if you connect on the other side (I think you know which point I mean by now).]
;W[ei]C[MB> Aaaaaaargh.];B[ch];W[ci];B[bh];W[ga]C[Now I think this was gote, it was a single eye anyway and I had another at b13. Am I right?]
;B[ha];W[gi];B[fj];W[gj];B[fk];W[ih]
(;B[jh]C[I protected territory on the right, maybe I should attach the white group more and take its eyes (is that even possible at this point)?

MB> It's very hard to kill white now. And your potential territory is on the right side, quite far away from K12. If I were to protect territory, I would play something like P11.

MB> The profitable area is on the left side now. See variation.]

C[As shown later I shoud've protected cuts in the group at the bottom now, with something like p8. It happens to me again and again - I leave those cuts and then they allow my opponent to reduce my teritorry. Any advice on how to avoid that in the future? Any shapes that I should look out for?

MB> You have to consider the cuts and read ahead and see how troublesome they are. Some dangerous looking cuts are really no trouble, while other innocent looking cuts lead to big groups dying. 

MB> Try to look at your cuts from the opponent's point of view. What would you do if you were in their shoes? How would you try to cut? Consider the follow-ups.

MB> But you'll get the hang of it in time. The usual advice I got when I was about 10-15 kyu was to play lots of games. Try to read through some basic GO books.]

[fm][gm][gn][hn][go][ho]C[Overall, why did I lose? What was it mainly? Not protecting cuts? Protecting from the wrong side, thinking I can kill? Invading to late?

MB> See previous comments.

MB> It seems to me that you play a little too defensively, and you confuse sphere of influence with territory.

MB> When attacking, don't try to kill by all means. Keeping the opponent's groups weak and under pressure may be worth more (and is easier to achieve). Even if they live with a few points, if you manage to make territory (or reduce enemy territory) while attacking that group means that the attack was a success.

MB> Don't crawl! ;-)

MB> If things don't go your way on a part of the table, look at the entire table for strengths and weaknesses. Try to profit somewhere else. In this game, you were too focused on the upper side and the white group there, and you attacked while leaving yourself with the E11 cut. You missed some opportunities on the left side and ended up with a superb wall only making a few points.

MB> Don't hesitate to email me if you have any questions about my comments or variations.]

;W[ck];B[fk]C[MB> This last move is just a personal choice - I'm trying to use and extend the influence of the upper left black wall, and pressure white.

MB> I see the area around F9 as the border between 'spheres of influence', and it's always good to push the border towards the enemy by playing in the border area.

MB> I'm not thinking that black gets territory in the upper and upper right areas, just that if white plays there he will have a hard time defending his invading stones, while black will turn some of the area into very solid territory.

MB> Likewise, the lower left and lower areas are not white's territory, just his area of influence. If black plays near the lower side or the lower-left corner, he will have to fight hard to get a group that isn't under attack, while white will get solid territory.

MB> So the point in playing on the border, at F9 (again, the exact location is *very* debatable) is to make it harder for white if he plays in black's sphere of influence and easier for black if he plays in white's sphere of influence. So it just gains some influence for black and weakens white's.]
