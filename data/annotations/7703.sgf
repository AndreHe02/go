C[[Qtip\]Hello, I'm not ranked yet but I hope you'll think this game to be of higher level than 30kyu.
It's probably only my 15th match or so total, and I always play friendly games against Burny and nobody else, because of lack of confidence in myself, with good reasons.
It's also the first time that I started running out of time, passing the 30 minutes limit.  So if you watch the times, you'll see that I play much more slowly than my opponent.

I watch games from other people from time to time, but I prefer to take a second look at my own games because I understand what the player (me) wanted to do, and because I can directly see what I could have done better.
This time, I'm interested in the opinions of a higher level player.  There are probably several details that I'll be missing.

And feel free to remove my variations as you see fit, if you want to make things less cluttered.

Finally I'd like to note that the reason I'm sending this match is that even though I'm the one who won, it's one of the rare games where I was well awake and played like I should.
Usually I don't take enough time to read and make mistakes I shouldn't be doing.



Hello Qtip! 

My Name is Corey and I'll be providing you with a review of this game. I'm about 20k - 18k and have been playing for a bit over a year now. If you have any additional comments or questions, I play on KGS under the username FarplaneCM, or you can email me at farplanedragon@gmail.com If you ever wanted to schedule a time to meet up I'd be more then happy to watch and commentate on some of your games. Before we get into the review a few general comments. 

The first thing is, at your level I'd highly recommend playing your games on either a 9x9 or 13x13 board. Being enthuseastic is good, but it's very easy to develop bad habits on a full size board until you've become more experienced. 

Second, don't worry so much about your time. It's there for you to use, so use it. In time, you'll start to learn more and more patterns and concepts and find that you don't need to think about certain moves as much. If you really like thinking you can try out a turn based server like Dragon Go Server. On a turn based server players make moves when they have time, so you'll have plenty of time to think. The only downside is games take much longer. I'm also on DGS as farplanedragon. 

It's definitely a very good habit to review your games. Experienced players will review just about every game they play, and for good reason, it helps you learn you and your opponents mistakes. So keep at it.

Lastly, I know it's hard, but you really should try and play against new people. The reason is, as time goes by, you start to learn Burny's strengths and weaknesses and this can cause you to play moves that would normally be bad, only because you know he won't respond. It's a bad habit to get into, so you really should try and find others to play against as well.]
;B[pp];W[eo]C[Although I'm reviewing for Black, I'll probably point out some items regarding whites move. A move on a 5th line like this is typically too wide and open. Typically, moves are played on either the 3rd or 4th lines.]
;B[pd];W[ee]C[Same as before, 5th line moves tend to be easy to invade.]
;B[kd]C[[Qtip\]Slightly defensive compared to K16, not knowing what he's planning.  At this stage, I thought that even if he goes right in Q10 I'd have nothing to fear because of my two star points.
At second glance I think I might be wrong to think that way because the gap is wide between the two star points.

K16 might have been better than L16 though.
The gap between K16 and Q16 is very tight.  If he attacks at N16, I should be strong.  If he just places a stone in the general area  of these two stones instead, I can place N16 and be very strong.

With L16 I can do the same, and it's probably more solid, but has less expansion potential.

Flipside, L16 alone is more solid than K16 alone, would I decide to only place one stone rather than two.  But I'm guessing it's not a proper situation for such a trait to have any usefulness or meaning...

What's the reviewer's opinion on these three moves? (L16,K16,Q10)


As a note, I'll admit that lunging forward with this move semi-recklessly feels more like my natural way to do things!




Personally, I think either L16 or K16 are okay moves. Your oppenent has played some wide opening moves and either would help set you up to potentially invade. I think the choice here is whether your an offensive or defensive player. Personally, I think I might have gone with K16 just for the little extra pressure it causes. 

As for Q10, I wouldn't have played it at this point. It's too slow, and if white does try and attack, he's likely to play to the left of Q4 for support, then above it, in my opinion.]
;W[ed]C[This is a poor move on white's part and only begins to highlight the issue of playing too far out.]
;B[jp]C[Probably a bit too early. Instead, it probably would be better to instead try to attack the upper left corner before white can secure it too much.]
;W[ec]C[White's playing close together, which although slow, is providing them with some security. Because you neglected to attack this corner last move, it's probably too later now to effectively do so.]
;B[pj]C[Uniting your two sides is a good idea, though I might have tried out the center point instead. It does make you easier to invade, but it helps put pressure on white. Either move is probably okay.]
;W[de]C[[Qtip\]I usually start on a corner/wall, and my opponent usually starts drawing a big circle in the middle and typically wins.  He knows I'm getting sick of it, especially since middle should normally be at a disadvantage (I don't understand why completely though, and I think starting in the middle might be a strong tactic against beginners like me.)  So this time he decided to go from an extreme to another, that's why you'll see him build a silly wall from the start instead...

Well, the wall is only really silly because of how close he's playing his stones. Defending a corner is a good idea, however he's giving up too much other territory to secure that corner. 

As for the question about strating in the middle,  that a very good question and a very important concept to understand. The following page gives a basic idea of the concept. 

http://senseis.xmp.net/?CornersThenSidesThenCenter

Corners are easy to secure, and thus can earn you a number of points. Sides are a little weaker, but in joining two corners, you can usually secure a side, as well as the territory. The middle is very difficult to secure, and due to the fighting that tends to occur, tends to be worth very few points. Remember, Go is about surrounding terrority, not capturing stones. Although captures are helpful, the majority of points come from territory.]
(;B[mq]C[[Qtip\]In the meantime, I'm not sure if I could have built a wider base without becoming too fragile...  I feel that my framework is already very light and expanded as it is, and going straight to K10 feels wrong somehow...

K10 would help you secure some of the middle territory, but in the end, would probably be worth few points. Your move is a safe one. A move at something like G4 might not have been bad either. Once again, depends on your style.]
;W[ce];B[cp]TR[fp][gp]C[[Qtip\] I dive into what usually gives me problems.  I lose most of the fights that start with one stone on each side.

In this case, you're playing a bit too far in, mainly because you closest support at K4 is too far away. Having a stone at one of the two maked points would have been a safer idea.]
;W[do];B[fq];W[gq];B[dp]C[This was probably your mistake. By playing inside, you're letting white cut you apart and trap you in the corner.]
;W[fp];B[eq];W[ep];B[dq];W[co];B[gr];W[hr];B[fr];W[hq];B[gp]
;W[ho]C[Burny [28k?\]: nice one?
Burny [28k?\]: tyty
Burny [28k?\]: trained for it alot
Qtip [?\]: Depends what you aim to do
Burny [28k?\]: depends on how you move on with G4
Qtip [?\]: Heh I didn't even notice I was trapped...
Burny [28k?\]: goody




There's a little irony here and that G4 is already dead. The good news is you've probably secured that corner, But he cut your apart at the same time.]
;B[go]C[[Qtip\] It may look like a stupid move, but I think it had potential...

In all likelyhood, probably not. The stones are already too closed in to get anywhere.]
;W[gn];B[ip]C[[Qtip\] ...But the problem is that I did this too early, so he saw right through it.

It's a bit of a troublesome idea even if played later. You'd have to have at least 2 moves in a row more important then the 2 required to connect your stones. Although it's not impossible, it's unlikely. Typically this is a bad frame of mind to get into.

Burny [28k?\]: :P];B[bo];W[bn];B[ao];W[bp];B[bq];W[an];B[ap]
;W[be]C[Qtip [?\]: In the upper left corner, you have basically 16 points...
Burny [28k?\]: cool huh?
Qtip [?\]: On the right side, I have ... 70?  100?
Burny [28k?\]: cool huh?



Well.....yeah, but use the score estimate feature. You'll see that white has a bit more then taht.]
(;B[og]C[[Qtip\] 3 words:
More-or-less, random-preventive, double-big-knight-move.


It might have been better to play something like L7. The main problem is since you got split apart down there, you're bottom right have been weakened. Odds are, he'll probably attack that first.]
;W[pn]C[Qtip [?\]: Just saying it's a waste of time to build that wall...

[Qtip\] He only needed 3 more stones to finish his wall, and I think I couldn't have done anything against that.  Finishing that wall of his might have made him win the game.

If he had finished his wall, how would you proceed to infiltrate and hurt him?
Or would you rather not let him finish the wall at all?

Well, ideally you'd have stopped him from buidling that wall long, long ago. However that time has long past. At this point, he really needs a stone at E19, if even that, to finish the wall. Keep in mind, stones can be apart, but still technically connected. 

As for invading, I really couldn't say if there's any possible way to do so successfully.  Espeically if he gets a stone at E18 or 19. Even if he didn't, It's an extremely low chance of successfully invading, and that point, you'd likely have to consider it a loss and try and make up the points elsewhere.]
;B[po];W[pm]C[I'm a little suprised he went this way, I'd have expected him to go left towards his other stones.]
;B[ql];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm]
(;B[ro]C[By playing apart here, you're basically inviting him to split you apart. Take a look at the variation for a different idea.]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[qp];B[qq];W[rq]
(;B[pq];W[sn];B[sq];W[rr]C[Burny [28k?\]: boom 2 more needed]
;B[so]C[Burny [28k?\]: nice one
Burny [28k?\]: now i need one less
Burny [28k?\]: for ..];W[sp]C[Qtip [?\]: ...ugh

Probably a good lesson on why you have to be carefull to read out situations. Had you done so, you probably wouldn't have made the last move and self-atari 'd yourself.]
;B[qr];W[oo];B[op];W[np];B[on];W[no];B[nq];W[lq];B[or]C[[Qtip\] Weird.  It looks like a wasted move to me now, but it does have a use in a variation not too far away...]
;W[mr]C[This move currently kills your entire group. Remember, your group needs at least 2 eyes to live.]
;B[rs]C[Qtip [?\]: hmm
Burny [28k?\]: :P

[Qtip\] A few seconds after the move, I realized that T2 was not going to accomplish anything.]
;W[nr]
(;B[oq]C[[Qtip\] Here I got scared and ran away like a little girl, wasting some neat potential...
Plus it looks terribly vulnerable now.

Plus, you filled in potential eye space.];W[ns];B[os];W[ps]
;B[lr]C[Qtip [?\]: Thanks
Burny [28k?\]: npnp

Lucky you, you brought life back to your group.];W[ss]
(;B[ms]C[[Qtip\] Better ensure the kill before it gets dangerous around R2 and potentially backfires on me.

I had not read very far ahead, maybe one move or three, but that and intuition were convincing enough.

...It seems I could have lived, though.

N4 is basically the critical point. You needed either to capture, or secure that point. Typically, securing is the better idea.]
;W[qs]C[Burny [28k?\]: thanks]
(;B[lp];W[rs];B[kq];W[io];B[jo]C[[Qtip\] Empty triangle seems necessary...

Too my understanding, an empty triangle is only bad if the inside point, in this case, J5 is empty, since there's a stone there, it's not bad, at least to my understanding.]
;W[ir];B[pl];W[om];B[qj]C[[Qtip\] I don't care about P6, I'll draw a pretty bamboo and strengthen what seems more important for the near future.

While it's not a bad idea to look ahead, you're group in the bottom right is still at risk. Remember, you need to eyes to live.]
;W[nn];B[gm]C[[Qtip\] Maybe I can somehow save these two stones later, but now would obviously be too soon because he's watching me.

Unless you capture one or both of the groups on either side, it's unlikely you're going to save those two stones. In Go, there's no "No man left behind!" policy. At times you have to learn to cut your losses and secure territory elsewhere to make up for them.]
;W[jr];B[hn]C[[Qtip\] *facepalm*
I guess it wasn't so obvious to me back then...];W[fo];B[in]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[jm];B[jl];W[hm]C[Burny [28k?\]: :P
Qtip [?\]: I see :/

Thus far, it seems white understands the strategy of splitting black into as many weak groups as possible. This is why it's important as black to make sure your current groups are strong and alive before you start making new ones.]
;B[km];W[im];B[mn];W[ln];B[lm];W[lo];B[mo];W[mm];B[ko];W[mp]
;B[ln];W[cr];B[gl]C[Slow down cowboy! White just invaded the little territory you had. Do you really want to give him potential for two moves in a row down there?]
;W[hl];B[gk];W[hk];B[gj];W[hj];B[hi];W[gi];B[fi]C[Think about your existing stones before making your move. While the area to the left is open, you currently have no other stones over there. You've got to keep your own territory secure before trying to take more. Your 4 stone wall probably doesn't stand a huge chance go surviving anyway, you have potential to secure a large part of the right side, you don't want to squander that away.]
;W[gh];B[fj];W[hh];B[ii];W[ji]
(;B[ml]
(;W[nm]C[Burny [28k?\]: aye very critical point
Qtip [?\]: It had the potential to be...
Qtip [?\]: I just had poor timing I guess];B[el]C[[Qtip\] Preventive measure.

I suppose I should ask what's it preventing? I don't mean to come off in the jerk way, but the educational way.  Granted, it could potentially create eye-space, which if you succeded and lived, would definitially hurt white, however, you're sacrificing whatever potential your had on the other side of the wall and letting white take away too much territory.]
;W[ih];B[fh];W[ij];B[ch];W[fg];B[eg];W[dg];B[ff];W[gg];B[hf]
C[I think the main thing you tend to do is leave an area before it's finished. Since you started trying to secure the section on the left, you should continue to do so until you're certian of either life or death. Leaving too early is leaving you with a number of weak groups/stones on the board that white is easily splitting apart.]

;W[bj];B[bk];W[ck]
(;B[aj];W[bl]C[[Qtip\] He didn't play C10 and yet he usually wins against me...

Well, that's likely due to the fact that the territory white stands to lose is worth more then that stone.]
;B[cj];W[ak]C[Alright, that was just silly.];B[al];W[am];B[ak]
;W[cl];B[em];W[cm]C[Probably would have played a space lower as white. Would have still given me room for an eye, and connect that three stone group.]
;B[en];W[ar];B[br]C[[Qtip\] A3 and B4 alone would have been too easy for me to stop, so he tried to go for A2,A3,B4 instead, and I managed to read through that...

However with my poor concentration, I forgot about that plan of his shortly after.]
;W[gs];B[fs];W[hs];B[fn];W[go];B[rl];W[aq]C[[Qtip\]"He's basically giving me two points?  Is he really that bad?  Well whatever, no use in even eating them, I'll count them as dead stones later...
...Oh, crap!"

Honestly a poor move on white's part. Fit's into that whole "Wouldn't it be nice" concept I mentioned earlier. The only good part to it is that it forces you to respond, meaning white can get the first move elsewhere.]
(;B[as]C[Burny [28k?\]: damn you saw it

I'd hope even the complete newbies would have saw that.];W[in]
C[Qtip [?\]: Yeah...I almost shrugged it off :/

At this point, it's all about reading ahead, just keep calm, and try to think of what he might do next.]

Qtip [?\]: It was already protected by another eye
Burny [28k?\]: but the 3 werent connected
Qtip [?\]: ...true, but I doubt it changes anything...I doubt I could have attacked in any way

Give yourself a pat on the back. This is completely useless move for white, which not only wastes his turn, but costs him 1 point. Just think, had there been no komi, that might have been the point that cost him the game. In other words, this is why you don't be lazy and not read out easy problems.]
;B[mb]C[[Qtip\]A 3-points-jump is good, but second line is bad, but with L16, P13 and the wall, I feel it protects a wide area.

Two pluses and one minus, but the minus is probably bigger than both pluses together.]

[Qtip\] Indeed...  But to salvage the situation, it seemed like a perfect cue to threathen him somewhere else, either to get something in return for his kill, or give some time for my pack of stones in the middle.
I was hoping he'd just blindly kill my stones without noticing what I was planning with S4.  But the variation might have been stealthier, and thus maybe successful...]

True, however it's easily deterred. J11 is all white needs to ensure life.]
;W[md];B[ne]C[[Qtip\] A day or two earlier, he told me that it was important to connect and prevent the opponent from connecting.  I've been reading a lot about Go so I knew that, so I said "I know, it's pretty much the whole point of the game".
So here I am, connecting and solidifying, innocently, when the game is nearing its end...

Connections are very important. Unconnected groups are at risk of being split apart and killed.]

[Qtip\] I gave myself a pat in the back for a job well done!  ...and that was my mistake because then  my game became worse and worse and worse until the end...

The true endgame starts here, but since I became very careless, I didn't put much thought into my moves, so there isn't really a reason to watch the rest unless you want to see how it ended.

Oh god.....

just.......

oh god......

Just to be clear here, you don't normally expect to get so lucky in high level games, keep that in mind.


That aside, endgame is just as important as the rest. At this point you're only about 10 points up on white. I'll give it a quick glance and offer some final comments at the end.]

Alright, well, hopefully I managed to answer your questions, and offer some insight on someone of the other areas of your gameplay. I think at this point you mainly need to work on two things. 1) Play alot more games, 2) Play games against more people. Especially the latter. I'd also recommend you play some of your games ranked, do so will help set your rank, and help find others to play against.  If you want to work on your reading abilities, try doing some life and death problems. If you need some problem books, let me know and I can email you a few that helped me at. 

Overall, just try and have fun. The path from 30k to 20k is a fairly fast one. 20k onwards is a bit thougher, but the rewards of being able to play a stronger game are well worth it. The biggest regret one can have is to play a game they didn't enjoy.

Well, this is why it's good to review your games. Someone we just miss stuff. If I could think of their names I'd link you to a pro match on youtube. In this match, it's late game and one of the players self-atari's himself, costing him the game, despite having thought about his move beforehand. A mistake isn't a mistake unless you willingly make it a second time.]

I think he just wanted to save his one stone and didn't see I could have killed several more.  Maybe I could have been stealthier somehow?

It's more likely that white would have played P6 for the previous move instead of capturing your two stones. In such a case, white is likely to live.]

White seems to be "over-developed" and/or heavy.  (But with my limited skills and experience, it's probably not exploitable.)

Well, at the moment all the white stones are dead, so yeah, it helps. I think you'd have to sacrifce a stone at S5 to make sure he can't make two eyes, but I'm not 100% on that.]
