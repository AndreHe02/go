C[Hello, Thanks for reviewing the game.  I lost by 17 and would like some general help to take my gave to the next level of maturity and awareness.

TM: Hi, my name is Tomáš (I will preface my comments with "TM"). I tried to answer all your questions and added a few comments and variations on important moves. You will find the summary of the game in the comment on the last move.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd]C[I am experimenting with the sanresei for the first time so there will be many mistakes based on the theory which I have not studied at all.]
;W[kq];B[dj]TR[pj]C[TM: I would prefer the right side here, because white has better potential for a mojo there.]
;W[qf];B[pf]LB[nd:A][qh:B]C[What is the main variation?  I was trying to keep him low.

TM: You can back off at A, pincer at B or play what you played – everything is OK.]
;W[qd]LB[qc:B][pg:A]C[TM: Usually white would play A or B here.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[qc]
(;B[rf]C[TM: This might have been too greedy. See variation.]
;W[rd];B[qg];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
(;B[nb]C[that caused me troubles. O17 would eliminate these difficulties.]
;W[nc];B[mc];W[od];B[nd];W[oc];B[ne];W[mb];B[lb];W[na];B[lc]
TR[jd][pd][pf]C[that run of events was not efficient. help?

TM: This is indeed a bad result for black. But there is not much you can do after move 21.

Notice the incosistency between this result and the chosen joseki. By playing Q14, you are enabling white to take the corner. In exchange, you want to get influence on the top side, so that all the triangled stones will work together. Here, you gave white a 14-point corner and there is no longer a top-right area to have influence on. You got some influence on the right side, but you ended in gote, so white is going to prevent you from using it effectively.

See variation on move 15 to learn how this might have been prevented.]
;W[qk];B[pj]LB[cn:A][ko:D][op:C][fq:B]TR[ql][qm][qn][qo]C[TM: This is small. And it helps white build the triangled area. Something along the lines of A, B, C or maybe even D would be better.]
;W[pk];B[qj]TR[rg][sg][ph][qh][rh][sh][pi][qi][ri][si]SQ[ol]
[pl][ql][rl][sl][om][pm][qm][rm][sm][on][pn][qn][rn][sn][oo]
[po][qo][ro][so]C[TM: So small. You get 10 poins at best, while white is getting 20, maybe more.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[nk]C[so I just strenghtened his moyo...];B[op]
LB[lp:A]TR[nk][ok][pk][qk]C[right time to invade?

TM: That is hard to say. See comments on move 33. What is clear is that you should have not helped white to build such a nice wall before invading.

Another question is if this is the right place after building the wall. Something like A migh give you a better chance to survive.]
;W[oq];B[nq]
(;W[or]
(;B[on]C[TM: This is too heavy. I think that you should not rely on living here localy. You should play light and try to get out.]
;W[ln];B[mm]C[an over play...best move? Q4, M4, R6?

TM: I do not see a sure way to live localy and after white M6 no way to escape either. See comments and variations on move 43.]
;W[nm];B[nn];W[mn];B[om];W[nl];B[qo]
(;W[ll]TR[qm][ro][pp][rp]C[TM: This seems a little slow to me, white might be able to kill the black group, so he does not have to worry about connection here. On the other hand the variations that I can come up without thinking too much are all complicated and mostly seem to lead to ko.]
;B[pp];W[qq];B[qm];W[ro];B[rn];W[sp];B[nr];W[po];B[qn];W[mp]
;B[np];W[rl];B[pq];W[pr];B[rr];W[qr];B[rq];W[rp];B[os];W[ps]
;B[ns];W[rs];B[lr];W[kr];B[ls];W[cm]C[I lived but it was not very pretty!]
;B[fq]LB[fl:B][il:C][dr:A]C[biggest move?

TM: This looks risky. I would try A to either live in a corner or get more aji for the invasion. After living there, you can reduce white at B or C.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[hq];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[er];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[ep]
(;B[jj]LB[fk:B][el:C][fm:D][bs:A]C[I should probably extend the F3,4 stones inorder not to loose them...

TM: You should play at A to not die in the corner (see variations). After that you may try to rescue the F3 stones, but that is risky. It might be better to just threaten to save them (something around B, C or D) and expand your mojo at the same time.]

Result: W+17


Thanks for helping out!

TM: This was mostly an even game. Most important moments:

- the joseki in the top-right corner – you should not let white take such a big corner and destroy all your influence at once

- the bottom-rigth corner – you should not help white build a defensive wall before you invade

- white should not let you to settle there so easily, he should make you run and take some territory in the proccess

- you let the lower left corner die

- you did not connect at F2

The last two could have been avoided (just one move for each) and cost you each about 15-18 points, so that is where you lost the game.

Thank you for sending your game for a review. Have fun playing go!]
