C[I played this game on IGS.
I am playing black and my temporary rank is 13k. White is ranked 12 kyu.
I lost the game by 1.5 points.

I put some comments so give you an idea about my logic behind certain moves, please criticise it !

Hello Maxime,
My name is Marcello Pisacreta, i live in Germany and i play Go nearly 2 years now. My rank is around 5 k atm. I play on KGS and my nick is DonMorti. This is my first review and i am happy to comment ur game. I will mark my Comments with MP: . I will comment this game for the black side. I`ll mark weak groups with triangles and strong groups with squares.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[eq];B[qk];W[ok]SQ[pd][qk][pq]C[This move surprised me a bit. I felt about moving out with a keima, but I didn't know how to choose between each side.

MP: 
Ur opponent just gave u a big present here. 
1. Ur  strong on  the right side, so there is nothing u should fear right now.
2. He just gave u a stone without a base. This stone is extremly weak
3. He did not played the biggest point on the board]

[sr][qs][rs][ss]C[I finally decided to choose the side with the stone on the 4-4 points. I thought the stone at the bottom was strong enough to support an attack from my opponent.


MP: 
In my opinion u should have played Black 7 around Q5/6 or R5/6(see variation) . Like u can see ur bottom corner is really big and the shimari is more important than supportin a 4-4 stone.

With ur move u got more potential territory but a shimari always includes a move on the side to make big territory.
Thats why a shimari is a bigger move then Q11.];W[pn];B[np]
;W[lp];B[qp]LB[ol:A][jp:B]TR[ok][pn][lp]SQ[pi][qk][np][pq]C[My point here was to secure my group (and gain some territory on the corner). I thought I had to do that know, the move at m4 putting pressure on my group.

MP:
Well, the thing is that R4 is a slow move, giving u strength and a secure base.  

Now white has two weak groups and he can only save 1 of them u should take this opportunity to plan an attack.
I would think of cutting the 2 stones with A, or of attacking the lonely stone with B. Both are big moves that make u strong while white has to run into the center.

(See Variation)]

;B[ar];W[cj]C[I have some territory in the corner, but I had the bad feeling of being already enclosed ...

MP: Dont worry about that, ur opponent made 4-5 engame moves, that made ur group live easy in the corner! U should be happy about this.]
;B[jc]LB[jc:B][jd:B][ce:A][de:A]C[For this move I hesitated a lot. I thought about a kakari at d15, since if white plays on the left side he's mapping a large moyo. But I thought a "simple" extension from my 4-4 stones on the side was a big move, basic fuseki strategy !

MP: Perfect move here, u got the biggest point on the board.
This is the biggest move for 2 reasons. U told the first , its a good extension from ur 4-4 stone. 
The second is reason is, its the biggest move for White too. If white gets a shimari on the left side, then a move at B is a perfect extension for white too. 
Well done.];W[nc]TR[ok][pn]SQ[jc][pd][pi][qk]C[... and my opponent probably didn't like the idea of me having a large moyo in the top-right corner

MP:
Yes thats probably true. I want to show u again the weak groups of white on the board. Maybe ur asking now, why is my lonely stone at K17 strong? Its because u can extend either to the left or to the right, so there is no risk of loosing the base right now.

What to do if ur opponent has weak groups?
Do not attach what means dont tsuke, but i do the same mistake often in my games.]
(;B[oc]C[I played tsuke since I have a stone at K17

MP:
I feel like ur doing a tsuke from the wrong side here. (See variation)
Right before i said dont tsuke, but i dont see which other joseki could be better. I think an simply extend wouldve been the best.]
;W[nd]C[the anwser I expected];B[pf]LB[lb:C][nb:B][ob:A]C[I followed the joseki but I also hesitated with making an extension to g17, my black stone being weak now (drawback of playing the tsuke ?)

An extension wouldve been good, but i think u shouldve robbed whites base instead.

(;B[gc]C[I felt unsafe about doing the standard 3-points extension from my 2 stones wall. I was afraid of an invasion at the middle of my stones.

(;B[ge]LB[cg:A][dg:A][ch:A][dh:A]C[Hence I first thought about invading around D12/D13/F12/F13 to keep his moyo under control, but I thought I had to give good hape to my group first and go toward the center

White does an endgame move here.
Ignore it and invade! If u dont anser white can reduce ur territory by 8 points, but invading like in the variation before is worth nearly 20 or more points!]
(;B[ob];W[eh]C[alas, then it was too late !

at this point I felt running behind, counting territories gives approx.:

white ~ 68 + 5.5 = 73.5
black ~ 63];B[eo]C[To be honest, at this stage I didn't knew what to do !
I played this move because I didn't wanted my group to be shut off by my opponent.
Now I feel like attacking white's only weak group on the right would have been a better strategy. Is it right ? But how ? robbing its base with R6 or S6 ?

MP: 
Ur right, attacking the 2 stones would be a big move.
Seriously this stones dont have any base! they cant make an eye on the right side.]

U could have played hane or extending the other direction, with a better result for u.]

MP:
GOOD!];W[nj];B[ni];W[mq];B[kf]C[I ignore my opponent's move. N3 didn't sound like a major threat to me. Instead I decided to shut off my opponents group. I also hope that this kind of moves would give me influence toward the center and finally territory. When all sides are settled like here, I don't know how to make territory !


MP: 
Well done again, White is playing endgame again its good to ignore it at this stage of the game.

The best way to make territory is by attacking a weak group, white got 2 weak groups try to enclose them , so that they have to make life by themselve.]
;W[lf];B[lg]C[With the proximity of strong groups on each side, I wasn't afraid of the cut.]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[mf];B[mg];W[kb];B[kh]C[I decided to ignore L18. I know in the end game my opponents can rob quite a few points but I wanted to take the sente and play elsewhere. Capturing the cutting stone seemed to be a big move.
The ladder actually works thanks to e5 ! but honestly on the moment I was thinking about playing a geta at J12 if my opponent extended at K13. Right after the move I was finally unsure the geta was working, but finally it seems it is.]
;W[nm]C[I was surprised my opponent gave up his cutting stone ! Maybe he's reading sequences better than me, I was unsure about my geta idea on the moment so I thought he would try to escape.]
;B[mn];W[ll];B[jn]C[Again, my only motivation is to avoid white to connect to the bottom. But I am not making any points ! Is my strategy dubious ?

MP:
No its not. Thx to ur attacks to Whites weak groups ur ahead of point at this moment. U got 3 corners and a little top side, while White got top corner left side bottom side and 2 weak groups. With each move that seperates whites groups u build up strength and now u couldve invade the bottom side because u got such a big strength.]
;W[fp]C[White defended his territory. I had in mind since a few moves to erase some of his moyo by playing at G4, but i didn't had the time to do it ...

What about still trying to invade? ur strong outside (see variation)]
(;B[rn]C[Finally trying to rob white group's base (and making some points in the process) but white's group has already enough eye's space to live !

Thats true

(;W[rm];B[ih]C[Again I was unsure about my geta idea so I prefered to make sure I captured white cutting stone. I thought playing here did it efficiently by also gaining influence in the center.

MP:
I added 2 variation. One that shows that geta doesnt work (if i missed a move im sorry) , and the second shows that a simple ladder works!]
;W[em]C[Again white played at a point I was  thinking about since a long time ! If I had been more confident about capturing the white cutting stone, I would have played here for sure. I was to afraid of the white stone escaping !

MP: 
I showed already that the ladder works, if u wouldve played here instead of J12 ur ladder wouldve been finished even earlier.
That was sure a big move u missed.];B[fn]C[escaping ....];W[nr]
(;B[cc]LB[di:A][dl:B]C[desperate invasion ... I wanted to see how my opponent would react and see what i could gain.#

try not to attach when u invade
A good tactic while invading is to seperate the opponents stones. For example D 11 is a good invading point]

From here the game entered it's final phase.
I didn't play the best yose, but most importantly I would like to have feedback on the game until this moment.

Thank you very much !

MP: 
At this stage of the game Black is leading with around 20-40 points, but ur territory has much weak spots so white could play a great endgame.
 U play solid and strong, but often u play slow moves, instead of attacking or invading. The good thing is, u know that u couldve invade, but  u are afraid of leaving a weak group on the board and thats why u miss the right time to attack/invade.

 U couldve won this game if u wouldve played a better engame. Because of ur fear u played many extra moves to defend in ur engame, instead of taking sente and attacking ur opponent. (For example Move119 and Move 147)

My review ends here too, i made some comments on ur engame moves and added a few variation to show u how to react better next time.

I hope u can enjoy my review, it was my first one and if u got any more questions u can send me an email, or add me on KGS.
