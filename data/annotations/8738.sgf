AB[pd][dp][pp]C[eratos [11k\]: Hi have fun!
Phil73 [8k\]: Good game !

JT: So, some summary ideas.

(i) Your number one problem, as far as fundamentals go, is not thinking about where your walls will be most useful. This is an especially big problem in handicap games, and can be easily solved.

(ii) Your number two problem is a tendency to play meaningless moves under pressure. Try to remember what your goals are and what each of your stones is trying to do in your grand strategic plan.

(iii) You also still have a problem with occasional blunders and misreads. (Moves like 44, 174-179, and 190.) This will go away with more games, more reviewing, more tsumego. It seems like you may have some of the intuitions of a 8k pair with the focus of an 18k, if you see what I mean.

By the way, I focused more on 1-140 than on the rest of the game, so just because I didn't praise or criticize a move in the endgame doesn't mean that it's not good or bad.]
;W[dd]
(;B[fq]C[I have no idea how to start in handicap games.  Am I making good use of my handicap by starting here?

JT's answer: it's not a bad use. But 4-4 stones emphasize influence; the biggest way to use them is with an expansion along the side. That's especially true when you can hit a point that is a side expansion for two 4-4 stones. Even better if you can approach a white corner, force a response, and then jump back to the dual side extension. --- If you do want a corner enclosure, (i) trying using the ogeima, and (ii) face it in the other direction, so that the wall you will get after a corner invasion faces towards your other 4-4 stone.]
;W[dj]
(;B[cl]C[JT: Small - W takes one of the three longest extensions on the board, you take a short extension.]
(;W[cq];B[cp];W[bq]C[JT: You can probably kill with D2.]
(;B[bp];W[dr]C[JT: E2 is better.];B[er];W[dq];B[fp]C[Not happy with this stone - where should it have been?

JT's answer: This is perfectly good. E3 is much better, but this should still kill.]
;W[eq]
(;B[ep]C[JT: Not a great move. White only lives in gote, but this is still a 17 point move (the corner is worth ~34 points). Black could be happy with this if he had the potential to make lots of territory with his wall, but D10 makes that difficult.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[es]
(;B[fc]C[JT: Normally this would be a good move, but after putting so much into getting that pretty wall, this is the wrong direction! To use the wall, approach from the other side.]

;W[jq];B[kp]C[JT: This is okay, but lets W live. M3 is a stronger attack: W has no base.]
;W[kq];B[lq];W[jp];B[ko];W[hq];B[jo]C[This was clearly a lapse in concentration, sorry.

JT: Yup.];W[gq];B[ho];W[qq];B[pq]C[JT: You don't seem to be thinking too carefully about which way you block. You want the walls you get after an invasion to surround an area that is (i) large and (ii) difficult for W to reduce. From Q4 to Q10 is five spaces of territory; from Q4 to M3 is three spaces of territory. And also, White can reduce without risk with the sequence M2, N3, N2 when that becomes large enough to play; on the right side, any attempted reduction by White leads to a difficult fight.]
;W[pr];B[qp]C[JT: Excellent. This is why White always plays R4 first.]

(;B[dh]C[It feels important to play in this part of the board, but is right in the middle of the 3-point extension a good plan?

JT: I might play lower. Actually, the right side seems bigger to me. See alternative sequences, one for C12, once for emphasizing the right side.]
;W[fj];B[fh];W[hj]C[JT: This is too brave from W. At this point black is connected and W is cut. Your job is to make sure W can't create complications.]

(i) Play at t4 first to fix your weakness there.
(ii) Play at p16 first to strengthen yourself in sente
(iii) Try to play moves that do several things at once. R13 makes a few points of territory around R13: a move like O10 weakens Q8 and F10 simultaneously.]

(;B[oh]C[JT: The N12 stones are irrelevant if you can cut them off from the H10 stones. Remember your strategic goal: capture H10. You can do this by cutting off N16 from N12, cutting N12 from M11, or cutting M11 from H10.]
;W[ng];B[og];W[nf];B[lf]C[This sequence makes N13 now look misplaced, where should it have been?

JT's answer: Excellent job recognizing that N13 looks bad now. The problem wasn't N13, though: that was a fine move, aiming to cut off H10 from N16. The problem was the subsequent moves you make, allowing W to plow through your stones like a choo-choo train. P12, P13, and M14 are all perfectly pointless.]

C[I now feel this is a mistake - maybe should cut at H14 right away?  Maybe something else?
