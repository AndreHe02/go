(;W[cg]C[syb: White is pushing its advantage.]
(;B[bf]LB[dg:A][cf:B]C[syb: This is inferior. You have to cut at A (see variation) but you cannot do that due to the unfavourable ladder. That's why B was a mistake.]

[ql][rm]C[syb: Ok. Now the white corner can't get two eyes. The only chance of surviving is to attack the triangle-group which is quite weak.]
;W[dn]C[syb: With the unsettled situation in the lower right corner at hand this is not a good move. Black can savely ignore this white approach and get a clear advantage.]
(;B[sp]C[syb: I don't like this move.];W[eq];B[dq];W[er]C[syb: This is too aggressive]
;B[ep]C[syb: Right.];W[fr]
(;B[fo]LB[dn:A][er:B]C[syb: This move doesn't help you a lot. It protects a cut that did not impose a threat and half heartedly attacks A (which is light and can easyly expand along the side).  It would be better to get some profit out of the weak white group B and punish white's mistake.]
;W[dj];B[cj]LB[er:A][pc:B][bc:C]TR[bf][cf][dg][ch][cd]C[syb: Hmmm... I don't like this one. You could still effectively attack A or play somewhere in the open corner (near or at B). If you want to help the marked group I would prefer the corner at C.]

(;B[dp]C[syb: Possibly black should go for a more stable position (see variation). And this definitely looks like bad shape.]
;W[co]C[syb: A wild chaotic mid-game-fight errupts now that ends in the loss of a large group for black.]
