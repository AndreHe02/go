C[Hi,



I won this short game (there is actually only the opening and the beginning of the middle game) through brute force... Though I am pretty sure that I did not always played right. I have the feeling that I made many dubious moves and that I only won because my opponent was afraid. Can you please point out my (and my opponent's mistakes if you see them? (I wrote my questions and comments alond this opening)



Thanks in advance for your help! / Marc (SweetPea^^)];B[qd]
C[oapj [2k\]: hi, gg

SweetPea [1k\]: hi, hf];W[dc];B[dp];W[cn]C[M: Should I take the empty corner instead?

janr: the move looks playable];B[de]C[M: What is the best answer here? Should I pincer?

janr: if white pincers, black will run out, when white defends, black may get the opportunity to separate c6 from the pincering stone.  So pincering seems a difficult way]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg]
(;W[ed]C[Why not pincer now ? it combines two locally feasible moves (a 3-space jump from c6 and a pincer above).]
;B[ck]C[M: Should I take care of  W C6 right away? How?

janr: maybe, but it's gote.  Taking the empty corner is big too.]
;W[od];B[mc];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[ne]LB[re:B][qg:A]C[janr: i like this move more when black plays A instead of B]
;B[kd];W[qf]C[M: Is this overplay?

janr: it looks ok.];B[rf]C[janr: if black answers like this, then white is satisfied]
;W[qg];B[rb];W[ic];B[gc]C[
janr: black is overplaying here I think.  he now has two weak groups]

;W[qa];B[sd];W[rg];B[qe]C[M: I am happy of the result here :-)]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[jc];B[lb];W[kc];B[ma]LB[gc:B][ff:A]C[black first weak group lives small, but there is still a cut at A.  black was not successful in playing B]
;W[lc];B[nc];W[ff];B[gf];W[ef];B[eb]C[M: I think B makes a mistake here. He should get out, right?

janr: geting out is urgent, yes.];W[gg]LB[fd:A][gd:B]C[janr: the safest way is to first exchange A for B]
;B[db];W[cb];B[ee]C[janr: now black can cut];W[fe];B[fd]
(;W[fc]LB[hg:A]C[Playing A instead would force black to live locally, allowing white to capture two stones in sente, getting thick.]
;B[gd];W[ec];B[hg];W[fg];B[if];W[he];B[je]C[janr: This strengthens white. Why not just connecting?  then black keepts more options to save liberties and side stones later.]
;W[hc];B[hf]
(;W[gb]LB[ld:C][df:A][jf:B]C[janr: A looks good.  It avoids black cutting by connecting at A.  if black saves his stones at the upper side, white can still connect at B or C and black group is still not fully alive while black's left side need protection too.]
;B[df];W[gi];B[hi]LB[kg:B][ii:A]C[janr: this move makes the weak white group stronger.  I would prefer to mave at A  or B or similar]
;W[hj];B[gh];W[fh];B[hh];W[fi];B[ej];W[ij];B[fj]LB[gj:A]C[janr: there is no need to help white connecting.  Black may like to cut at A later himself]
;W[gj]C[janr: now the black center stones are virtually lost.]
;B[jh];W[ki];B[ji];W[kj]C[M: Is this the best move to kill here?]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[kk]LB[lg:A][kh:B]C[janr: to escape locally, black needs to move at A or B, but I don't think it is sufficient.]

C[oapj [2k\]: thx

SweetPea [1k\]: thx



M: If my opponent doesn't give up I planned to tenuki and play in the empty corner. Would that be right? Or should I play C3 instead?]
