C[R: Hi Taucetil, Im Gergely 4k from Hungary. I mark my comments by "R:". Hope you can find it useful.


RankBot001 [14k\]: GTP Engine for RankBot001 (white): GNU Go version 3.7.7

I'll be pleased to know the biggest mistakes i've made. Any comments to improve my game are welcome ;-)
This is my first game on KGS, in the ranking room. I play black. After this game, KGS gave me the rank of 15k?, I'm sure it's not accurate ! I'll need some more play ;)

Sorry for my english....

(;B[cm]TR[dn]C[R: Here you can consider the marked move. C7 is very deffensive in low position and leave bad aji nevertheless at both side. Last but not least it has no any good continuation.
See var. (one step back.)];W[fn];B[nc];W[lc];B[ne];W[pf];B[ng]
;W[ph];B[mq]LB[qj:A][qk:B]C[R: upper side would be more urgent. There is a weak black group needing help. Shimari in the corner will live for sure, and the two extensions are miai (exchangeable).

R: Anyway, I would prefer the right side extension (A, B) instead of lower side, because that would attack corner white group and prevent ideal extension for white.]
;W[ic]
(;B[ql]TR[qj]C[R: Slow. Black missed the big point and let white to play at triangle. Shimari in the corner is secure, so black can be brave. If white pincers: jump out.]
;W[ko];B[mn]LB[qc:B][kd:A]C[R: this seems to be territorial move.

R: What are the options? Let see..  you might consider to press down white at 'A' this will help your weak top group. After securing your group you can invade the corner at (B).
 
R: Please notice, N6 worth at most 9 points in gote.];W[qj]
;B[ok]TR[ql][mn][qo][mq][pq]C[R: now we can clearly see: many stones are guarding relative small territory. Thats not effective (consider that we made it in gote!) Six stones ideally can keep much larger area under control. (see var.) 

(Of course nothing is ideal, but building small territory in gote is always bad idea, fight would be much more effective.)]

(;W[oc];B[od]C[It hard to deal with the beginning of a game !  Where are my biggest mistakes ?]
;W[ob];B[pe];W[qe];B[oe];W[qc];B[og]LB[kd:A]C[R: There is nothing to fear. Black can connect without the bamboo.  You might try to press down white somewhere about (A) to increase force towards the center. This will help your weak group to live later.]
;W[km];B[pg]C[Reviewing my game, I think this Q13 move is not necessary now. Perhaps should I try to stop the white group in the bottom. But how ?]
;W[qg]
(;B[ck]TR[em]C[R: this move has only one purpose: make some territory. The *best* moves are which have at least 2 purposes. For expl. attacking some group AND building a territory, attacking two groups at once, and so on.

R: Here (I think) E7 would be better if Black wants to make his wall more solid. (var.)]
;W[bc];B[cd];W[fl];B[ef]TR[ci][ck][cm]C[R: this move now far less effective since the other stones are in low position.]
;W[kk];B[mi];W[fj]
(;B[ei]C[R: Small. About 2 points in gote. Black should press the attack now! Let see an another idea: (variation)]
;W[fr];B[er];W[ad];B[ae];W[ac]
(;B[be]C[R: +1 point];W[lr];B[mr];W[hi];B[hf]LB[le:A][ki:B]
C[R: wrong direction. Marked stone dont make territory and (later) might be cut off. Please notice since neither white nor black can make territory here (via one move) no need to hurry.  Try (A) or (B) to strengthen weak group and attack white.]

[qk:B][mm:F]C[From now on, I just resist to white...  I do not know how to reduce his territory...

R: Answering white has begun about 5 moves before i think. This is importance of keeping sente. In the endgame you have to try keep sente.

R: marked stone worth about 2-3 points but it is gote for both side.

Lets search alternatives:
(A) would capture a stone end press down white if unanswered. We can consider it sente.
(B) would capture a stone and ruin w territory.
(C) if unanswered makes huge destruction. Sente for sure.
(D) can capture a stone (before (B)) 
(E) threatens uppers side
(F) threatens the lone white stone and makes B territory a little bit stronger.

If you can keep sente, you can even turn the game from this position. (White supposed to make mistakes  :-))) 

Anyway, White is ahead, so we must press on, we shouldnt loose our guard and build few points in gote. Taking 1 point damage on white in sente is mucho better than earn 2 points in gote!]
;W[nm];B[nn];W[de];B[df];W[sl];B[sm];W[sk];B[rm];W[lh];B[lg]
;W[kd];B[le];W[mh];B[mg]C[R: save the stone instead!


In general: Your fuseki play was quiet good in my opinion. In the middlegame  you shouldnt concentrate on territory so much. Try to play higher moves. In the endgame I cannot stress enough the importance of keeping sente. Althrought  its not easy and I also always mess it up myself  :) we should try our best.

Thanx for reading!

R: Any further moves at 'C' or attacking at 'D' will make a huge profit later.

R: If W invades, black can attack immediately and chase it across the board, since both black group is safe. So that, W invasion is not reasonable so far.]
