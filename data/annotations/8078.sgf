;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq]LB[oc:A][od:B]C[csh: It's probably bigger to play at A or B.]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[oc]LB[iq:A]TR[cq][dr]C[csh: This is a bad time for Black to tenuki. Black needs to finish the joseki in the lower left, probably at A. If Black doesn't want to lose sente, then it's probably best to not play the marked black stone (and force White to play the marked white stone).

When Black plays elsewhere, it allows White to attack the group in the lower left. This is what starts some of the problems for Black.]
;W[hq]C[csh: This is a good pincer for White. The corner group is solid, and the black group doesn't have a base.]

(;W[jp]LB[gr:A]C[csh: It's probably better for White to take here. That way, Black playing A is not sente.]
;B[hn]C[csh: Black has solidly captured the stone, but has lost sente. Also, there are ladder breakers along the lefthand side of the board.]

;W[cb];B[cd];W[bb]
(;B[lc]TR[jb]C[csh: This move doesn't attack the white group at the top of the board. It also doesn't help Black get territory, since White has already slid underneath with the marked stone. Instead, Black should extend down the left side.]

[sn]C[csh: I think Black had problems early on with making weak groups. As they were chased around the board, they did not die, but they had to run while White made territory attacking them. Black would manage better if he solidified his position before attempting to attack weak groups.

White seemed to do well, but probably should have played more solidly once in the lead. Because of some problems in the middle of the game, White gave Black a few chances to come within striking distance.]
