C[This game was played on OGS correspondence ladder. I played white.
My main concerns are direction of play and sente. More importantly in the middle game there was a big central fight and I felt I did poorly attacking blacks weak groups.

Thank you in advance for any comments and reviews.

Sincerely Slacks

Hello Slacks,

I hope my review is constructive!  I think the main problem in this game was that you played timidly in the opening and seemingly afraid of taking influence.  You let your opponent get all four corners, which isn't a problem in and of itself.  I often do it and there are some famous pros who do it, (including my favorite, Takemiya Masaki).  The problem was that in giving up the corners, all you gained in return was settled low territory on the sides.  This hurt your ability to fight in the center later in the game, although there were a couple of places there where you could have done better in those fights.

-Paul];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]LB[fq:A]TR[pq]C[I don't like this approach by Black, the weakest stone they have is marked in the lower right corner.  This move doesn't work as well with the stones Black already has on the board.  I would have had Black 5 at 'A'.  I'll get back to why I am mentioning this in a moment.]
;W[cf]LB[df:A]C[So this move isn't necessarily bad, but given that Black's stones aren't working well together, I would consider going with a more influence based appoach and play this move at 'A'.  Given that the direction of the game ends up steering towards a fight, more influence would be more helpful, especially since you aim on playing tenuki two moves later.]
;B[db]
(;W[po]C[On reviewing this move i think its bad since white can finish the joseki in the top corner then come back to 8.
---
This move isn't bad, but when you play it, you are essentially ignoring Black's threat to capture territory.  In order for this to be effective, you have to take a strategy that involves taking influence in the opening and follow it consistantly.  That is the best way to gain adequate compensation for the corner territory you are giving up.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq]
(;W[qj]LB[pj:A]C[This move should be at 'A' I think.  Black is low most places of the board, but is gaining solid territory.  No moves you have available really get you much in the way of solid territory so you need to seize influence to effectively counter.]
;B[cc];W[ci]LB[dk:A]C[This is a really timid move.  Black doesn't have a whole lot of help if he is to attack your corner stones, so there is no need to play this move.  It secures a very small amount of territory, an inadequate exchange for the value of the move black just played.  As show in the variation off of move 14, I would definitely play this stone at 'A']
;B[qf]
(;W[ob]LB[fp:A][jp:C][gq:B]C[was this invasion too early? whats the biggest move at this point?
---
This move does feel too early for me.  Because of Black's low position all over the board, he really can't secure the top size with one more move, and the lower size is still wide open.  I'd consider a move at 'A', 'B', or 'C']
;B[pb]
(;W[lc]LB[pc:A]C[This move is too light.  When you touch stones, they tend to get stronger.  The usual thing to do would be to push in at 'A', I think it tends to lead to a better result.]
;B[oc]C[Allowing Black to have this move is unacceptable.];W[ic]
TR[ob]C[This isn't a great result.  The marked stone has only served to make Black stronger in the corner.]
;B[cn]LB[ci:B][dk:A]C[To go back to an earlier point, imagine you had a stone at 'A' instead of 'B'.  Black probably approaches from the other side, you launch a pincer, and get a large moyo on the left side.]

(;W[cl]LB[ck:4][dn:2][co:1][fp:3][jq:5]C[On review i think this pince is where the game becomes really bad for white. I had no corners.
---
There is nothing wrong with no corners.  If all your opponent has is corners, and no influence, they are often in a very weak position.  The problem is that you have let your opponent gain territory in the corners without gaining the requisite influence.  In this case however, giving up all the corners is not so great because of your low position all around the board.

In this case, I think the attach and extend joseki is preferable for you.  Consider something like White 1, Black 2, White 3, Black 4, White 5.]

[dr][pr][qr][rr][sr][as][bs][cs][ds][es][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Rough estimate, you are behind about 20 points at this stage of the game.  You need to make some bold moves.]

(;W[gd]LB[ie:A]TR[cf][ci][qj][cl]C[I wanted to juse 34 to gain influence in the middlle, but this attack seemed to leave too much aji without strengthening the top group. Should I have jumped instead?
---
This is probably acceptable given the lead that Black has at this point.  Jumping out at 'A' makes your group more secure, but it does nothing to narrow the gap in score.  Black has no weak groups, which is a problem.  Black's main weakness is a lack of access to the center, so a move like this that exploits that weakness is probably your best bet, although I can't say it enough, I wish the marked stones were all on the fourth line.]
;B[fd];W[ge];B[fe];W[ff]LB[df:A]C[I mentioned much earlier that for move 6, I would have liked to see it at 'A'.  You can see here a stone at 'A' would be more effective in this fight.]
;B[gc];W[ef]LB[ee:C][gf:A][hf:B]TR[gd][ge]C[I don't like this move as it leaves a cutting point at 'A' and the marked stones weak.  Consider instead playing at 'A' or 'B', really sealing Black off from the center.  Black plays where you played this move, you can always cut at 'C' pretty effectively.]
;B[fp];W[fo];B[iq];W[go];B[gf]
(;W[gg]TR[ic][lc][gd][ge]C[This is the wrong direction.  Your marked stones are weak.  You need to push away from them, strengthening them in the process.  It's possibly you were concerned with keeping territory on the left side, but what you should probably be doing is using your stones on the left side to attack the cutting stone.]
;B[hf]TR[fo][go]SQ[iq]C[As you can see here, you have pushed Black into attacking your weakest stones, and you have to spend time protecting them rather than putting pressure on Black.  Also, the two marked White stones are no longer able to cut off Blacks group if it runs down the edge of the board and it will most likely be able to escape to the marked Black stone.]
;W[ie];B[if];W[je];B[hh]C[Because you pushed from the wrong direction, you can really see the result here.  Black was able to lean on your group on the top in order to give his stones in the center some space to maneuver.  It is getting harder and harder to attack these stones effectively.]

(;W[gh]C[I think trying to attack Black here is a little premature now, given the space he has been able to give himself. I'd try attacking his weaknesses in other areas of the board first.]
;B[hi]C[I saw that the cut worked and wanted to punish black. However it turned out very poorly for me.]
;W[hg];B[ig];W[ih]C[If you are going to push and cut here, I might consider just doing it directly.]

(;W[mf]LB[eq:A]TR[ih][ii][ij][ik]C[This move is a big mistake.  Push and cut here.  Your marked stones are the weakest stones in this fight, but they are also putting pressure on the line of five Black stones on the left.  You need to use your marked stones to attack both black groups.  Also soon might be a good time to make uses of the aji at 'A'.]
;B[lg];W[mg];B[lh];W[lj];B[mh]LB[in:A][eq:B]C[These stones are in danger of escaping.  I think it would be best to shift your attack to the other group of stones.  Consider attacking them with something like 'A' and exploiting the aji at 'B'.]

;B[fm]C[Now you can no longer rescue your stones.  Up until this point I thought you still had a chance with a perfect endgame, but after losing these stones, (I'd estimate it's as large as a 20-30 point swing.  There is not too much to say about subsequent moves, so I will end the review here.]

Black has solid territory in two corners, but not much in the way of real influence and their stones are kind of disconnected and working independently of each other.  By contrast, White's stones are all working fairly well together  The extension from the marked corner stones is actually a fairly common extension and it works well with the star point in the lower left.  From this position, White will have the advantage in most fights.  

And of course, it obeys Lockett's Law...  ;-)  http://senseis.xmp.net/?LockettsLaw (This is humerous, don't adhere to it too strongly.)]
