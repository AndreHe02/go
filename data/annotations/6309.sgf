C[Hi! Thanks for reviewing. I was white in this game. Any advice you can give me is great, but I'm particularly interested in one position half way though the game when I had no idea how to continue. Thanks very much!

forfun (hereafter ff) - This was an interesting game to analyze.  Chances came up for both sides but no one could quite take full advantage of the opportunities until the very end.  I will concentrate on the early and middle part of the game.  The heavy punching as Black and White traded groups at the end provided a little less study material perhaps (lots of enthusiasm but not much science :-)]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[cp];B[eq];W[gq];B[gp];W[hp];B[fp]
(;W[iq]C[ff - Looking across the board, there is a major choice here.  Playing the connection says that White will build a position on the lower right and handle the inevitable attack on the lower left stone in a way that will prevent Black from gaining too much of an advantage on the left.  The alternative is to play on the left and let Black cut at H3.  See the variation...]
;B[ho]C[ff - This is an unusual choice here.  It is from the 3-4 joseki when White approaches at 5-4 and Black attaches on top.  The danger is that Black will give White too good a position on the right without being able to compensate on the left.]
;W[io];B[in];W[hn];B[go]
(;W[hm]C[ff - This looks like an overplay.  White is cut into three here while Black has only two groups.  Since the ladder does not work (even if it did initially, Black has the atari at K5 to break it), White is being extremely optimistic.  See the variation...]
;B[cn]C[ff - Although the White stone looks lonely on C4, it is in the corner and Black is not.  Is B6 an overplay?  It invites White to cut.]

(;W[dn]C[ff - Black will inevitably cut White.  The question is whether White can play D5 and force a way into the center.  There is no easy answer to this.  See the variations...]
;B[do];W[co];B[cm]
(;W[dp]C[ff - See the question in the variation...];B[eo];W[dr]
;B[jo];W[ip];B[gr]C[ff - A big mistake by Black.  White does not take advatage of this  on the next play.]

(;W[hr]C[ff - A familiar looking response to G2, but White has a much better reply.  See the variation...]

;B[fm];W[kk];B[ll];W[lk];B[ml];W[mk];B[ol];W[nk];B[nl];W[pj]
;B[qq]C[ff - Far too aggressive.  This leads to big trouble for Black...]
;W[pq];B[rp];W[qr];B[kq];W[kp];B[jp];W[jq];B[kr];W[ko]C[ff - A sharp play.  White prevents Black from easily making eyes here.]

;B[so];W[nn];B[ql];W[pm];B[ok];W[oj];B[rl];W[rj]C[ff - This is the correct side and a good play.]
;B[qk]
(;W[qj]C[ff - White treats R9 as a forcing move.  However, it is not.  White should simply kill the Black stones and end the game :-)  See the variation...]

C[This is the point at which I was really lost. The game seems about even so far, or possibly even better for white, but I didn't know how to play next. I'd really appreciate some advice about a good strategy for white here. Making use of the big wall is obviously important. Also I was concerned about black making a large territory on the left.

ff - You have correctly identified the two main points here: (1) getting value for White's wall, and (2) limiting Black's prospects on the left.  At the same time, White should not think that there is some great play waiting to be made here.  This is not a situation where White can achieve everything.]
;W[nc]C[ff - I think I would have made this same play.  It seems a little more positive to try to use White's strength before worrying about Black's potential on the left.  This is the right direction, approaching along the right side is far too narrow...]
;B[qf]
(;W[pb];B[kp];W[nr];B[qc]
(;W[qb]C[This is obviously a bad move. I really had no idea how to play here.

ff - The board is wider than this play implies.  See the variation...]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[me]
(;W[od]C[ff - Basically White forces Black to strengthen the position here.  This is not a good idea.]
;B[ne];W[ld];B[oc];W[ob];B[pc];W[fc];B[ni];W[nj];B[hk]
(;W[gk]C[ff - Both H9 and this answer at G9 are off the mark.  See the variation...]
;B[gl]
(;W[fe]C[ff - This should clearly be at C14 in my opinion.  Black can push down the top group at any time so White will not be able to get full value for this jump.]

(;B[jd]C[ff - Big overplay by Black.  If Black just pushes along the top and then responds on the left, White may be in trouble...]

ff - Completely agree.  This was a pointless play.  The 3 White stones have no role in the action here.]

ff - Agreed.  Comments end.]
