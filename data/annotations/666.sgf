C[Dear Alexey,

here is the game review you requested, I hope it will help you to find some points in your play you can improve.

In the opening, you missed an important opportunity to completely shut in one of your oppent's corners. This would have easily compensated for one handicap stone! Instead you just tried to snatch away the corner territory, invested an additional gote move later, and still black got some points in the corner.
Don't try to go for territory too early in a handicap game. It's more important to build up strength, to shut your opponent in and to keep his groups separated.

In the endgame, you (and also your opponent) made a lot of careless moves, losing sente and missing the big points. In the endgame, you could have gained at least 10 points. You should learn the difference between double sente, sente, reverse sente and gote and - most important - to keep the whole board in mind. Missing the big endgame points is often a matter of making `obvious' responses which turn out to be too small (there is a nice example in `Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go' by Kageyama Toshihiro where black looses a lead of 30 points by just answering what look like sente moves).

Best wishes
Christian Gawron]

;W[po];B[dd];W[jc]C[I would prefer a kakari to put some pressure on black, but that may be a matter of style.]
;B[dj];W[fq];B[hq];W[fo];B[kp]C[A bad move. Black should play at D6. If he is afraid of J4 or a counter-pincer, he shouldn't play H3.]
;W[dn];B[co]C[Aji-keshi. This move just helps white in shutting black in. Just living in the corner is not good enough (and can be achieved without strengthening white like this).]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[dr]C[Thats too greedy. Shutting black in is more important than snatching away the corner territory.]
;B[bn];W[cq]C[C8 is still more important.]
(;B[cm]C[Very good. Now black is connected and white hasn't gained much. Furthermore, there is still some cutting-aji.]

(;W[nc];B[oc]C[Not good since it induces O16, which makes K17 an ideal extension.]
;W[nd];B[pl]C[Huh? Permitting Q15 is unbearable.];W[qq]C[Should be at Q15.]
;B[pf];W[mq];B[mo];W[fc];B[fe];W[ed];B[ee];W[dc]C[Don't push into the knight move except when you want to cut!!
E16 is an aji-keshi of the worst kind!];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[do]
;B[cp];W[ep]C[Avoids the cut, but only in gote, and is therefore much too small.]
;B[dq];W[er]C[Huh? Why not C2? White shouldn't give away points so easily. Now you took gote and there is still the cut!]
;B[fd]C[Bad style.];W[gc];B[np]C[Maybe aji-keshi, but I'm not sure ... Reducing may be better than trying an invasion which fails.]
;W[oq];B[op];W[pp]C[Blunder. Has to be at Q3.];B[nq]C[Yes.]
;W[or];B[nf]C[O2 is bigger.];W[jq]C[Good.];B[jp];W[iq];B[ip]
;W[hr];B[ho]C[Bad. With H4, black would gain sente.];W[gq]C[Not necessary.]
;B[qi];W[qk]C[Overplay.];B[pk]C[Must be at R8.];W[ql];B[pm]
;W[qm];B[pn];W[qn];B[ji];W[oo];B[nm];W[no];B[mp];W[cf]C[Overplay, especially since Black can connect by capturing E17.]

;B[hn];W[hm]C[Too small. Your stones are already connected, so you should take one of the real big endgame points, like R17, S10, B17, B2.]
;B[nb]C[Very big since it eliminates the aji of R17.];W[mb]
C[If white considers O18 as sente, he should have invaded at R17 before (e.g. instead of H7). Letting black play such a move in sente really hurts.]
;B[pb];W[lc];B[bc];W[bb];B[nr];W[kr]C[Way too small. There are still big double sente points such as S10!]
;B[bq]C[C2 is bigger.];W[cr];B[ei];W[fi];B[hh];W[ih];B[hg];W[ig]
;B[hf];W[jg];B[kg];W[mf];B[mg]
(;W[lf]C[Unimaginative. White should not destroy the aji related to L12.]
;B[lg];W[oe];B[pe];W[of];B[og];W[ne];B[ng];W[nn]C[An aweful move! Still S10 is a big sente move.]

;W[na];B[ob];W[br];B[aq]C[Why not A2?];W[eo];B[em]C[Again: If E5 is considered sente by black, he should have captured instead of playing A3. The difference between sente and gote is very important, especially in the endgame. As a rule of thumb, a reverse-sente move is approximately twice as big as an gote move of the same nominal value.]
;W[el];B[dl];W[ek];B[dk];W[ac];B[ad]C[A18 should have been blacks privilege (after capturing E16 with sente).]
;W[ab];B[oa]C[This move isn't urgent at all, because it would be gote for white!
