Remember that you don't have to kill everything in this game. Sealing white in with looser moves will give you greater profit.]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[ds]C[Moves like this should be reserved for endgame. It's gote, which means your opponent doesn't need to respond.A move like this is only worth 1-2 points, and there are much more open areas of the board to play in.]

(;B[dl]C[Helping the C-8 stone isn't very good. You already have a stone at D-10. As you can see, D-6 stone is very weak and needs more help.

Also note that before playing here, the C-8 stone has 3 liberties and the D-6 stone has 2. Counting liberties is a simple way of determing which stones are weak.]

[qo][ro]C[My recommendation for your play is to learn when to play faster moves. A common method of play amongst beginners is to play slow moves and to contact stones. Try to take time before your moves to identify any weaknesses you have as well. Taking a couple seconds to find out what needs to be defended the most will improve your strength by several stones.]
