C[Hi.

This is a game I played in IGS as black. I have reviewed tha game and I
can't see any big mistake (but they are, sure). I'd like to have
comments about the way I attacked the big white group in the center and
the ko in the left. Also, I'd like to have some general strategy
advises.

 Thanks
Hernando];B[dd];W[dp];B[pc];W[qp];B[oq];W[mq];B[qe]C[Olaf: N3 is a severe pincer. You have to follow a special plan to ignore it. Such a plan could look like: "I abandon the stone at P3. White has to add 2 other stones to completly catch it, so i get 3 moves elsewhere."]
;W[op]
(;B[qq]C[Olaf: Inconsequently. If you try to rescue the corner (sure it is possible), consequently white will completely surround the corner building a wall towards the outside. Better strategy would be first playing at the outside yourself. This way white always has the burden, that your cornerstone suddenly will life or he must add another stone there.]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[pp];B[rq];W[rp];B[rr];W[or];B[qs];W[nq]C[Olaf: The game clearly favors white in this corner. White has an impressive wall in both directions the right side and the bottom while black has 3-4 points.]
;B[qi]C[Olaf: Sure, the wall looks impressive and playing in front of it is not small at all, but in the moment the right side is not as big as it seems. The reason: You cant attack white there evan with another move, because white is very strong there. And white too can't attack you there because your stone at R15 is low. The variations of move 9 are still better than playing here.]
;W[fc]C[Olaf: i would have played from the other side instead, but both is possible.]
;B[hc];W[cc];B[dc]C[Olaf: good decision. :-)];W[cd]
(;B[ce]C[Olaf: looks like a severe hane, but actually is an overplay as it leaves the much more severe cut at D15.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[fb];B[ea]
(;W[cf]C[Olaf: this way black gets the chance to mainaine the position by connecting at D15]

(;B[be]C[Olaf: There must be a reason to play it. Again the reason can be to abandon the corner to play at the outside yourself. This would frustrate the white starpoint-stone a little bit by cost of 15 points in the corner.]
;W[de];B[df];W[ee];B[fd];W[ed]
(;B[fe]C[Olaf: This way your loss in the corner will become useless. Sacrificing 5 stones are OK, but you have to get someting for it! The right is open to invade for white. The left is more important.]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[eg];B[fa];W[ga];B[gb];W[da];B[gc];W[cg]C[Olaf: Now 2 corners are played out with completly different results. In the lower right black gets 4 points while white gets a perfect wall on 2 sides. In the upper left white gets about 30 points + influence towards the whole left which works perfectly with the starpoint at the bottom. Black there gets a wall with a lot of holes (H15, J19). You are behind by 30 points right now.]
;B[fq];W[fg];B[iq];W[dn];B[he];W[hg];B[kd];W[nc]C[Olaf: An overplay that perhaps will bring you back into the game. White has no need to be so aggressive here.]

(;B[mc]C[Olaf: Do you want to catch this stone? Sure you want (you has to)! But than there is an iron rule to learn: "Don't touch the stone you want to catch!" Touching the stone will make them stronger. Surround the stone, cut the stone of from his friends, but never never attack it by touching it.]
;W[oc];B[pb]
(;W[ne];B[md];W[oe];B[pg];W[ng];B[lf];W[ni]C[Olaf: Now white is out of danger so far.]
;B[pk];W[lh];B[jg];W[eq];B[er];W[dk];B[ep];W[dq];B[dr];W[cr]
;B[eo];W[do];B[ji];W[en];B[go];W[qm]C[Olaf: dangerous as white is nearly surrounded in the middle.]
;B[mk]C[Olaf: good try.];W[fr]C[Olaf: white plays a risky game. :-) Seems that he doesn't care about his stones in the center.]
;B[gq];W[es];B[gr];W[ds]
(;B[kr]C[Olaf: not as necessary. The bottom will survive for sure, if it connects to the center. Beside of this it already has some eyespace. There is only one all important fight on the board and you both have to follow it. It is time to catch the white stones in the center! The most open door is around the stone at N9, so you have to play there.]
;W[lj];B[ll];W[kk]
(;B[kl]C[Olaf: In which direction would white like to walk? Surely in that direction he could connect to some friendly stones. And exactly in that direction you chase him. This way you are helping white.]
;W[jk]C[Olaf: a little bit slow, J9 is possible too.];B[ij]
C[Olaf: good];W[pi];B[pj];W[ph];B[qh];W[og];B[pf];W[ik];B[gj]

(;W[ej]C[Olaf: again too optimistic about the stones in the center.]
;B[hk]C[Olaf: very good, now white is cut off. But note: it took 3 tenuki from white. 3 times white doesn't care about his group and now finally you have the chance to kill it.]
;W[im];B[gl];W[rk];B[rj];W[qk];B[qj];W[mj];B[oi];W[oh];B[oj]
;W[nj];B[nk];W[lg];B[mh]C[Olaf: good and necessary.];W[mg];B[ki]
;W[li]C[Olaf: doesn't help white anyway. Its only one eye with or without this stone. So the move is simply wasted. Your chance to kill the group.]
;B[kn];W[jm];B[jl];W[il];B[km];W[mf];B[le]C[Olaf: Why that? Do you still want to kill the group? You have to do, otherwise the game is over! Try to count to decide your strategy!
white: has about 70 points on the left and5 points on the right.
black without the center group you have 23 points on the upper right, 4 points in the lower right corner, 6 points at the bottom and 10 points on the top (White still can play J19).  So without further calculation you have to kill the white group and the only move that will protect immediate life for white is P14!]

C[Conclusion:
You lost the game within the first 50 moves! Go is a kind of trade. If you get something here, you have to give your opponent something there. If you dont move in the lower right, your opponent will get an advantage there. If you are outnumberd 3-1 there, its hard to fight without giving your opponent an evan bigger advantage there.
On the other hand, if you sacrifice some stones as in the upper right, ensure that you take what your opponent have to give you for it. Giving away both the stones and the outside advantage for the stones always is a bad trade.

The fight in the center was played careless by white and it would be fair for that, that he should loose something for it. But again due to only 1 mistake you gave away your gain for nothing.

The Ko at the left was nearly meaningless.

Hard words, i know. :-( But at least i hope they will help you somehow and please take in mind that i am a weak kyu by myself so don't overestimate my words. ;-)

Keep on playing
