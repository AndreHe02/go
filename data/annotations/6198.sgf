C[Dear reviewer. My name is Dmitrii, and I'm about 2k at IGS. I play black in the game.
I don't know my real rating because I play very rarely. So you can give me a hint :)
This game was played in the local club. My opponent is ukrainian 2 dan. I think that his game was too conservative as though he didn't want to press on me too much :)
I would very much appreciate any comments and advices on how I can improve.
Thank you.

Forfun (hereafter "ff") - Thanks for an exciting game.  Unfortunately Black threw this game away due to an oversight in a good position at the end.  Before that both sides fought hard.  I thought Black did not quite understand the nature of the position early in the game.  It seems like Black underestimated the value and strength in his position.  This is easy to do.  Many of us tend to worry about the weaknesses in our positions and think that the opponent's chances are greater than they really are.  In this case Black made a "mistake" at the top and White unexpectedly captured a stone.  However, as a result, Black had the chance to make a very powerful wall.  Possibly because he felt that losing the stone was indeed a mistake, Black played away.  I thought this was the most interesting point for studying in this game.  I think Black would quickly become a lot stronger by learning to judge the position more calmly.  Let's see what happened...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[ce];W[jc];B[hc];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]
;B[lc];W[qc]C[ff - An unusual play.  The pros seem to always jump to O15 here.]

(;B[oc]C[ff - Naturally Black wants to take advantage of White's last play.  However, this has the feeling of pushing White from behind...]
;W[ob];B[nd];W[mc]C[ff- This is normally considered a bad play when there is no White stone on K17.]
;B[md];W[lb]
(;B[kb]LB[mb:A]C[[Dmitrii\] I should first play at [A\] of course

ff - Even A is difficult in this situation because White can get a ko and Black will not have any ko threats.  See the first variation.]
;W[kc];B[ld];W[mb];B[jd]C[ff - The idea behind this play is very bad.  If there is one play in this game that Black should want to avoid in the future it is this one.  Let's see why...]
;W[jb]C[[Dmitrii\] Seems unnecessary

ff - White wants to finish here.  If White plays away, Black grabs the two White stones and takes all the territory in front of the upper left shimari.  Instead, White secures the capture of the L18 stone and waits to see what Black will do.  If Black does not finish the top with L16 , then K16 becomes a poor play that strengthens White without improving Black's position.

If Black does not plan to finish here, then he should have waited to play at the top.  Depending on how the game develops, Black might have chosen a different approach than the play at K16.  The obvious alternative here was to play H18, closing the top while threatenint to pull out the stone.]

(;B[pn]C[ff - First, fundamentally Black should want to finish at the top.  If Black can not do so, then K16 was a very poor play.  What happens if Black plays L16?  Let's look at the first variation...

If Black believes in any case that he must leave the top in order to play first on the bottom, this is the wrong side to play on.  See the second variation...

Finally, the high play at Q6 is played when Black wants to build territory in the middle of the right side.  This is not what Black should want to do with the wall.  Fundamentally the wall is for fighting.]
;W[np];B[qp];W[qq];B[qo];W[rq]
(;B[pk]C[ff - It seems that Black wants to build territory here.  However, look at the space between Q9 and the Black wall.  It is too narrow.

Ask yourself, would Takemiya choose this play? :-)];W[dj]C[ff - This is an overplay.  White extends too far.]

(;B[iq]LB[nn:D][cq:A][gq:B][lq:C]C[[Dmitrii\] Is this the point to play? I thought of invasion at [A\] in case of w[B\]-b[C\]-w[~D\] exchange..
Maybe I could play at [D\] first, then find place to invade white's moyo?

ff - First, when you think of playing "D" (O6) first, look at the relationship with Q9.  Consider the opposite order of plays.  If you had played O6 on the previous play and White answered at D10, would you play Q9 next?  I do not think so.  So O6 is out of the question here.

Next, J3 is fundamentally about reducing White's territory.  It says, "If I reduce White and then White reduces me, I will win."  Is this true?  What is the score?  In any case, this approach is inconsistent with Black's earlier play.  The bottom side is wide open.  White can not close it with one play.  White is not going to turn this into a territory contest on the next play.  So what should Black do?]
;W[kq];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn]C[ff - White naturally extends toward the stone on D10.  White is pleased with this development.]

(;B[kj]C[[Dmitrii\] I think it was too soon. Where is the best point to play?]
;W[pj]C[[Dmitrii\] Nice invasion point, isn't it? :)]
(;B[ok]C[ff - In this kind of situation it is clear that White can attach against the R14 stone.  Black needs to have a response ready.

Since Black has played L10, it is a little strange to extend up instead of extending down.  See the variation...]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[qi];B[rk];W[rj];B[qj];W[oe];B[od];W[qk]
(;B[pq];W[oq];B[qj];W[qg];B[rf];W[qk];B[pr]C[[Dmitrii\] Not a ko threat, of course.]
;W[rl];B[qj];W[og];B[qk];W[pe];B[pf];W[of]
(;B[pg]C[ff - Is it better just to connect and continue to attack the whole group?]
;W[ph]
(;B[oh]C[ff - Black settles for a piece of the White group.]
;W[qe];B[rg];W[qh];B[oi]LB[re:A]C[[Dmitrii\] I should first play at [A\]

ff - Playing at S15 first forces R16, which fills in one of the Black wall's liberties.  It is probably better not to play it.]
;W[re];B[rh];W[kd]C[ff - Black pays for his bad shape here...]
;B[lf];W[ke];B[mg];W[cg];B[dl]C[[Dmitrii\] What about this move? Isn't my bottom group too weak so I can end up with two weak groups running out?]
;W[fn]
(;B[io]C[[Dmitrii\] Seemed quite necessary to me

ff - Actually Black has become strong in the center.  So it is not clear that White can attack and kill the bottom Black group.

In any case, if Black has to answer this then the invasion point on the left has to be considered after F6 and J5 are on the board.  Is D8 a reasonable play in that case? :-)]
;W[ek]C[[Dmitrii\] The following sequence seems questionable for both sides. Is there a way for black to live unconditionally? (and also, can white kill invader for sure?)

ff - The position is too complex with the potential in the corner and various threats to cut or squeeze around the outside.  The point is to play for a reasonable result.]
;B[cj];W[ci];B[dk]
(;W[bj];B[el];W[ck];B[ko]C[[Dmitrii\] Now I don't really think i could tenuki at that moment. But white didn't punish me.

ff - After White captures the C10 stone, the left side group is safe.  There is no rush to capture the three Black stones.  White may just be waiting to see what happens, expecting to attack Black on the left later.]
;W[lp];B[cq]C[ff - This seems like an overplay by Black.  However, White does not find a reasonable answer so the result is quite good - Black lives everywhere.]

(;W[er]C[ff - This seems an overplay.  White does not come up with a strong follow through.  See the variation...]
;B[bp]C[[Dmitrii\] Is this the right way to live? Should I invade after all?]

(;B[hi]C[[Dmitrii\] Correct shape?

ff - Clearly not.  At the end of the game, there is a lot of potential for Black to get cut around here.  Probably Black should push at F10.  The White stones are strong so do no need to worry about White adding more stones.]

(;B[be]TR[jb][jc]C[[Dmitrii\] I thought I can kill white with this. But due to the possibility of connection with the marked stones he can live. Right?

ff - Yes, after all this time, the exchange of K16 for K18 hurts Black for the last time. :-)]

;W[bh];B[ag];W[cf];B[bf];W[ed];B[cc];W[hg]C[[Dmitrii\] It seems that I am caught.

ff - Yes, trying to break out to the right seems more reasonable than what happened.  However, there is a lot of bad aji in Black's central position so it seems unlikely that Black can avoid losing something here.

(;B[kd]C[ff - This completes the manuever that Black began with P17.    Look at the top right White position.  How many points has White made here?  Less than 20 points so far.

BLACK IS NOT BEHIND!  Strategically Black has done exactly what he set out to do with P17 - built a wall across the top and pushed White down onto the second line.  If instead, Black originally wanted to cut off the K17 stone, he should have tried something different (see the variation to P17).  However, the wall gives Black tremendous thickness.  Black should be happy.  Now Black waits to see what White will do here.  The only thing Black knows for sure is that in order to use the upper side thickness, he must look for fights.]

The wall has some cutting points but it is not clear that White has any real hope of taking advantage of them.]
