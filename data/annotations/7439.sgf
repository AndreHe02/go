C[Hi, I'm Meekohi and I played White this game. I feel like I made some major mistakes in the early game that gave too much solid territory to black, but can't quite put my finger on it, and I'm sure I made many small mistakes as well during the game :) Thank you reviewer for your help!]
;B[pd]C[Mattias> Hello, I will do the review for you this time.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]LB[fd:A][ce:B]C[Mattias> There are many places to play after this approach. These two might be among the more common. Which one you shoose is probably a matter of style. See variations for common sequences.]

(;W[fd]C[Looking at this closer, apparently C15 is more common, but it seems like a scary move to play :)]

(;W[nq]C[I felt like I was loosing ground, and probably extended too wide here, but I felt comfortable that even if black cut both groups would manage.

Mattias> It is more important to keep attacking blacks stones in the lower left than to build your own area. See my variation.]

;W[or];B[mr];W[pq];B[op];W[qq];B[nn];W[oo]C[Should have gone straight to R4 or further]
;B[po];W[qp];B[qo];W[os]C[Mattias> This small corner was not worth the influence black got. He also hurt your bottom group a lot.]
;B[bq]C[Mattias> Now this black group is secure.];W[bp];B[dq]
;W[cp];B[aq];W[ap];B[bs];W[lr]C[In hindsight this move wasn't important since my group can run to the middle, and there are much bigger moves avaliable.

Mattias> Yes right now it is not important. The worst part is that it is gote and black can play elsewhere.]
;B[pj];W[nc];B[oc]
(;W[ob]C[Mattias> This move is not so good for white.]
(;B[pb];W[od];B[pc];W[oe]C[I thought I could leave P18 in exchange for getting access to the right side, but it didn't work.

Mattias> It is ok.];B[nb];W[mb];B[oa];W[md]C[Mattias> You got better shape after this while black didn't gain much.]
;B[qg]C[The territory black gained with this move ended up being huge later on. Is there a better response?]
;W[id];B[kd]C[This cut was very frustrating for me since I didn't feel like I could do the same thing to black's territory]

(;W[le]C[Mattias> It is hard to attack this directly. So first try to find something else to threaten. Then you can have use for that stone in your next attack.]
