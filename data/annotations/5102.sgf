C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  This game is like so many others of mine in that no matter what I try, I fall badly behind early on, and end up with a whole bunch of weak groups.  It seems as though the only way I can win is to capture one of my opponent's fairly big groups.  But in this game, I had fallen so far behind that even capturing an entire corner wouldn't be enough to win.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger

Hi, Ted --

If I could wave a magic wand and change one thing about your play, this is what it would be.  Under attack, you tend to make passive, gote moves for eye space without putting any counterpressure on your opponent's groups.  You need to learn more fighting tesuji and use them.  I strongly recommend three books:  Volumes 4 and 5 of the  Janice Kim "Learn to Play Go" series: "Battle Strategies" and "Palace of Memory".  Also the Volume 1 of Yutopian's Art of Go series, entitled "Connecting Stones".   This is a problem book illustrating cutting/connecting techniques which are fundamental to fighting.

All of your problems in this game stem from that.  Many players are too aggressive and fail to beware of cutting points.  You are the opposite -- very solid, but failing to exploit your opponent's potential cutting points.  There are lots of variations in this game which should help you start to see potential counterattacks.  Simply paying attention to the concept should add two stones to your strength in short order.

Good luck!

C[RickMott: When White plays an unusual move like E3, low and practically begging you to approach his corner, you should at least consider obliging him.  C4 or C3 would not be bad ideas.]
;W[nc]C[ Rick: This is a common response to the Chinese opening.  Your weakness is that white can extend to the left, as well as diving into the corner.  So the standard pattern is to attach, to force white into an overconcentrated result.  See variation here.]

(;B[qf]C[Ted: Perhaps I should have played the pincer attack at M17 here.  After all, a similar attack worked for my opponent later in the game.

RIck: The "book"  is the attachment at P17 first.  See variation on last move.]
;W[kc]C[Rick: White should probably slide to Q18 first, forcing you to respond at R13, then play this extension.  This is too good for white; your three stones would be overconcentrated, and your J17 stone weakened.

If you extend to M17, white will take the corner with R17 and be satisfied.]
;B[fc]C[RickMott: This seems solid but a little passive.  Kato liked the one-point jump to J15 instead, even when White has a 3-stone group, so you should definitely play it here.]
;W[qh]C[Ted: I didn't see this move coming.  But this brings up a problem: if I play something to keep White from pincering Q16 and R14, White will weaken J17.]
;B[pc];W[ql]
(;B[nq]C[Ted: Things really start to go wrong here.  I attack, and predictably end up with a weak position.  But if I don't attack, I'm going to give up too much territory!

Rick: First, an approach move isn't necessarily an "attack".  This is an invasion, really.  It's not a bad move.

However, I can think of two lines of play I like better.  White has committed himself to a low position on the right, so I would leave that alone for now.   The most important part of the board is the left side.  Since the bottom-left corner is still open, I like C4 to  start working on the left while reducing White's corner.  You could also play around C7.  Then if  White invades your moyo, C4 is and ideal follow-up; if white makes the shimari, you take D10 for a big moyo.

The alternative is to fight in the upper right.  Your top right corner group is stronger than it would be in the joseki, so use that for attacking.  You can take White's base on the top anytime by playing M8 or N18 with the support of the two outside stones, but I wouldn't do that first.   See the variations for some possibilities.]
;W[lq]
(;B[no]C[RIckMott: The usual response to a close pincer is to jump in to the 3-3 point.  Running leads to complicated fighting; 3-3 is simple.  See variation.]
;W[pn]
(;B[kp]C[RickMott: This is asking to be cut.  3-3 is still good.]
;W[lp];B[lo]
(;W[kq]C[Rick: This is an odd move for White.  I think he should cut on the outside.  See variation.]
;B[ko]C[Rick: Good move, since I think the cut here was good for white before.]
;W[jq];B[mo]C[Ted: I thought about this move for a long time, as I was wondering whether sacrificing the O3 stone would be a good idea or not.  I know it's a bad thing to protect every single stone you've got on the board, but in this case, I think O3 is important because it stops White from taking an even larger amount of territory in the lower right.

Of course, I have no idea where my group is going to get eyes.

Rick: Why didn't you make the double tiger's mouth at N4?  This group is strong and facing the center of the board.  Running out later is good enough.  White should have no chance of killing this group.]
;W[cp]C[Rick: Big for white.];B[cj]C[Rick: Big area for both sides.  Good move.]
;W[cg];B[cm]C[RickMott: Too passive.  You must jump out with E10 or even F10 and force white to run with his weak stone.   You can get this extension, or maybe even C6, later.]
;W[je];B[eg]C[Ted: Another move that goes spectacularly wrong.  The point of this move was to leave White with a weak stone at C13, but that's not the way it works out.

Rick: This move is not bad; maybe the follow-up wasn't right.  But White should have run before with this stone, so capping it is a fine idea.  You're right, white is weak in the middle of a lot of black stones.  You're strong on both sides.  What's not to like?]
;W[di]
(;B[dj]C[Ted: I wonder whether this shouldn't have been at C11.

Rick: Here's a tactical trick I learned from Janice Kim's Vol. 5, "Palace of Memory".  She calls it the jump-cut: C12 in this case.  Look at the variations to see how it works.  It's a valuable technique to know.]
;W[ei]C[Rick: You're focussing on your lower stones, when you should be working on your upper moyo.  The jump-cut still works now.  You could also attach on top with C14, but the jump-cut is better.]
;B[ej]C[Rick: This is called "pushing from behind" and it's a bad idea.  You are making yourself overconcentrated on the bottom left, you can never get ahead of white, and you're weakening the top left.]
;W[df]C[RickMott: Ouch.  This is painful for black.  Now the jump-cut doesn't work; see variation.]

(;B[ef]C[RickMott: Wrong side; you're just pushing white into your moyo.  Block from the top at D15 and give up the stone.]
;W[de];B[dd];W[ee];B[gg]C[Ted: Now I'm stuck with another weak group.

Rick: Well, white is not secure either, but it would obviously be better if you had taken a bigger corner and just given up a single stone.  You're still in the game, though.]
;W[gi];B[ig]C[Rick: This is not so bad.  You are out in the center, white's upper-left stones are still fighting from a position of weakness, and you are weakening his upper right group with a view to the eventual splitting move at R10.  You must prevent white from linking up his groups, though.]
;W[fj]C[Rick: This is not a good move by white.  You're groups are too strong.  Now you're strong enough so the jump-cut works again!]

(;B[fk]C[Rick; This is following white's plan.  He will get strong on the outside.]
;W[gk];B[fl];W[ge]
(;B[kg]C[Rick: Running is not good enough here.  You must separate white.  Tricky fighting; the variation shows one possible line.]
;W[nf];B[ji]C[Rick: Playing purely defensively means white will connect everywhere, and you're in big trouble after that.  You have to look for places where you can cut and fight to create a local advantage.]
;W[jk]C[Rick: Ok, let's look at the board from the point of view of creating some opportunities for black to fight with local advantage.  You can sacrifice some stones to do it.  You also have to think about using your wall at the bottom.

Where are white's possible weaknesses?

  1) The connection between D11 and C13 is not  solid.

  2) The 3-space extension on the right.

  3) The 4-space extension on the bottom.  Maybe the 4-stone bottom center group can be attacked.

  4) White's shape at the top looks a bit loose.   Maybe we can make a cutting opportunity there.

First, a little reading. Black D12 will separate the white stones, but we don't want to do that right away.  So let's start a fight in the center that may let us create either of two attacks: against white's center stones, or against the single stone at K9.  See variation.]

(;B[li]C[Ted: I'm just trying to figure out where to get eyes for this group -- I don't think I can afford to let White capture it.

Rick: Yes, but look to save it through cutting and fighting, not just passively making eyes.  See the variations from the last move.]
;W[lk];B[mg];W[mf]C[Rick: All you're doing is making white stronger all around you.]
;B[lf];W[le];B[jf];W[hf];B[hg];W[ke];B[kf];W[io]C[Ted: Now I'm about to be saddled with *another* weak group.

Rick:  It's not immediately clear to me which side is weaker locally.  I can see two possible lines...]

(;B[lm]C[Rick: Much too timid.];W[pq]
(;B[nm]C[Rick: Much too cramped, not efficient.  N9 looks like the right move here.  White gets a free pass.]
;W[nk]C[RIck: Correct for white, keeping black separated.];B[jm]
;W[hm]
(;B[jn]C[RickMott: You have to look for breakout possibilities when your opponent is attempting to enclose you.  In this case, pushing and cutting at J8 is the only way.  See the variations.]
;W[fn];B[em]C[RickMott: too small, too defensive, makes it too easy for white to complete his moyo.]
;W[en];B[dn];W[do];B[cn]C[RickMott: After the lower left is solid for white, it's very hard for black to win.  White is far ahead.]
;W[ci];B[bj];W[be];B[bd];W[bi];B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[gc]C[Ted: Another move I didn't see coming.]
;B[gb];W[fd];B[ec];W[hc];B[hb];W[id];B[jc];W[kb];B[qj]C[Ted: I was desperate by now.  I've got weaknesses all over the place, and I couldn't find any White weaknesses.

Rick: This is not a bad idea, but it's way too late.  If white just gives you the stone and solidifes his positions, he can't lose.]
;W[qi];B[oj];W[ol]
(;B[nl]C[Ted: This is a mistake; I think I should have played O11 instead.

RIck: Well, it does have the advantage of preventing white from squeezing your bottom group to death.  See variation.  If white tries the same thing now...]

(;W[ok];B[nj]C[Rick: bad move.  Now white can kill you again.]

(;W[mj]C[Rick: But fortunately, he doesn't see that sequence.]
;B[mi];W[ni];B[nh]TR[nj][oj][qj]C[Ted: I realized I was going to lose the stones on the right, but I didn't think I could let White connect O11 to O14 directly.  I thought I needed a stone here to get eyespace.]
;W[oi];B[ng];W[oh];B[ml]C[Ted: I played this to get eye space for my group on the bottom.

Rick: Good idea. :)];W[mk];B[il];W[hl]C[Rick: Pointless move for white.  He has lots of sente plays elsewhere: K16, P18, S13, for starters.]
;B[ik];W[hi];B[ih]C[Rick: this is one point in gote.  All those sente play for white have equivalents for black: P18, S13, P2, N2.]
;W[kl];B[km];W[on];B[nn];W[kj];B[ki]C[Ted: I spent quite a bit of time trying to read whether I needed to play this move now, or whether I could tenuki.

Rick: You could tenuki, because you have the option of connecting out with P13 as well as making eyes.]
;W[jj]C[Ted: Thankfully, White didn't stop the move I was thinking about when I played L11]
;B[dp]C[Ted: I thought I might be able to capture something here.]

(;W[eo]C[Rick: White can save himself a lot of agita by letting you have one stone.  He doesn't have to be fancy, he's way ahead.  See variation.

This is my last comment of the game.  As you point out, you can win this corner and still wind up losing the game.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[br];B[er];W[ep];B[ds];W[fr]
C[Ted: At this point, I resigned, as I saw no way to capture anything.  I saw:

40+ points for White at the bottom,
40 or so on the right side
20 or so in the top.

For Black, I saw:

15 on the top left;
15 in the top right;
15 on the left side;
10 in the middle.

So, I'm behind by about 45 points.

However, White then said that I resigned too early, as I could capture the B2 group!  We looked at the position, and it turns out that although I can indeed capture that group, I'd still be behind -- capturing is only worth 30-35 points.]
;B[bs]C[Ted: I didn't see this move at all.];W[fs]C[Ted: White lets Black capture the group, but takes sente.]
