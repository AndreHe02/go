US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[0.5];W[pp];B[dd];W[fc];B[ef]C[This is a little  loose
d14 or c14 is better

Other posibilities are e17 which cuts white off from the corner.

A pincer is not a good idea unless q16 corner stronger];W[db];B[cc]C[Actually  this is not a very big move but okay

You can come back to this point after taking sente.

Attacking q4 would be good then
once it was resolved come back to this.];W[ic];B[nc]C[This is a very small  extension

Should have extend to q10 or k4

I like k4 because it works well with d4 and builds a big moyo threat on left  side.]
;W[cn];B[dj]C[This is a pincer type move and is okay but runs white  right through the center.

I prefer to safe up the bottom and go f4 or f3 or even c5

If he extends to c9 then attack with a pincer, the strength from c17 stones  would work well then

Right now white has too many options and you have shown your hand];W[fp]
C[This is a great attack

It attacks corner stone and is a very good extension from q4.  Notice how  little d10 influenced c6?
C6 has lot's of room to run or make shape];B[eq]M[dn]C[Normally a good  idea is to lean agains c6 at the mark spot to build up influence to attak f4]

;W[bo];B[bp];W[ck];B[cj];W[bj]C[dane 24k*: should I have responded to this?

Yes! You should go b11 to seal him in.  you will gain solidity and he will be  small.

Remember you don't have to kill him to make territory.  Threatening a kill is  just as good.  Don't get bogged down trying to kill everything.]
;B[co];W[bm];B[gm]C[f7 would have been more pressure

White couldn't go f8 because of the cut at e8 which he couldn't capture.]
;W[ci]C[Now you see why you should have answered b10];B[di]C[I think sacrificing a  stone at b9 would trap him.

The sequence would be b9 which he must answer at b11 or b9

If b9 then Black goes b11 capturing c11 next

If b11 then black goes c8 capturing something. Either c9 in a ladder or d7  because of liberties or c8]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[cg];B[dg]C[I would have tried c14  but not sure how that turns out]
;W[ce];B[de];W[cd];B[dc];W[lc];B[me]C[Not  much influence really.  And extension towards q4 would be better.

N15 is not threatening anthing so where would white want to go?

most likely q10];W[pj];B[ph]C[See how your extension looks small compared to  q10?

Notice also how little the terriroty to be had in the middle is.];W[qc]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[ob];B[nb];W[rb];B[pb];W[qb];B[oa];W[sc]
;B[se]C[This is an end game move! no need for it now.  Much bigger points to be  had.  It would make a good ko threat for latter, but now is wasted.]
;W[sd]C[This is sente for the side

A move at r15 threatens both q16 group and s15 group.
One will die.

After going t15 you must follow up at r15 or r14.  Which results in gote for  black.  See why t15 was not so good now?]
;B[nn]C[Way too high!  What is this  trying to do?  Take center territory?

If trying to pincer q10 it doesn't work.

You are very stong on top now a pincer at q8 or q7 would be good

q7 is better because it theatens corner as well.];W[qn];B[np];W[mr];B[oq]
;W[pq];B[or];W[pr];B[lo]C[Black has made white very strong!
A direct invasion at r3 would have been much better than this!];W[ip];B
[jn];W[qe];B[pe];W[qf];B[qg]C[This move should have been q14

White doesn't take advantage of that but black really has lost a lot more  than just s15 group if white wants to take it.

If white goes q14 then more threats are generated and s15 group is still lost.

sequence would be q14, r13 r12 then white sealed in.];W[rf];B[pf];W[nj]
C[It  is obvious black has lost now.
White is solid everywhere and has no weak groups to attack.

Perhaps slitting e4 group from j4 group would do something, but wow that  looks tough! :)

I would start with k4

or maybe m3 to help a cut at k4

There are too many small knight moves here and it is suspicous looking.  I'd  look for a weakness for a long time before my next move.  But currently I  don't see anything better then k4 or m3]

;B[mj];W[li]C[From this point on you  both struggle for dominance in center.

Black must win big time.

So White can play safely and not risk much to win.

I have no more comments on this game.];B[lj];W[kj];B[nk];W[mk];B[oj];W[lk]
