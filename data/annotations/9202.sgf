Hi,

It is hard to say about openning, as in handicap practically there is no openning :) In high handicap basic strategy is to put pressure on white from very beginning. When white plays his first stone here the ratio of black to white is 4:1 - great advantage... soon it will be 54:50 etc., so you do not want to let white have good position then :) So first of all - use handicap stones aggressively.]

[pp:D][cq:G]C[Don't rush and don't follow your opponent. Almost every white move is answered locally.
It's good practice to always assess the situation on the whole board. There are many places you want to play, so first of all ask yourself 
"Do I REALLY need to answer this move?" :)

Here you can't attack white stone hard enough. It has some place to live on the bottom, it can also run to the center. So it is not top priority to chase it NOW.

You can use three step recipe for strategy (use it flexibly) :)
1) Do I have any weak groups, that can be attacked easily? If yes - I should fix them.
2) Does my opponent got any weak groups, which can be easily attacked? If yes - I should attack
3) Are there any big points on the board? If yes - I should start taking them before he will.]
