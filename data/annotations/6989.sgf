C[Hi,

My name's Joss (KGS: tealeaf). I'll put my general overview of the game here, and then make comments through the game. There'll be a few final thoughts at the end as well.

You asked about building territory. From looking at the game, I would say that you are too worried about this. Because you've got the idea that you find it hard to build territory, you are focusing too much on making "safe" zones. This allows you opponent to build up much larger areas, which then turn into their territory. I would say that, at the moment, you aren't confident enough 

So, my first advice is to stop worrying too much about territory. Territory is something that happens later in the game after you've laid claims to areas. You need to focus on staking claims around the board so that they can later turn into territory. Remember that the game is about getting more territory than your opponent, so you need to balance getting your own territory with stopping your opponent from getting territory. If you do it right, they end up with just a tiny bit less than you. :)

Anyway... on to the comments.];B[oq]C[paragoomba [15k\]: hello

Always nice to say hello to your opponent. :)

To be honest, I don't know enough about opening theory to understand this move. If you're comfortable with it, then it's fine, but make sure that you understand why you're making a particular move.]
;W[pd]C[kirby3 [15k?\]: hi];B[cp];W[dd];B[pj];W[ql]TR[oq]LB[qp:A]
[qf:B]C[This is the first actual contact between the two of you, and I'd say that you panic slightly. Because of the height of the marked stone, the corner is open for invasion. I think that I would have preferred either to make an enclosure by playing at 'A', or approaching the white stone at 'B' for move 5.

(I should point out that nothing I say is "right". I can only give you "how I'd play"!)

As it is, you need to do two things in this situation: (1) Lean on the white stone (if you can) and (2) Secure your own stones.]
;B[pn]LB[qf:A][qp:B]C[I think that this move would be reasonable if you had a stone on the star point. As it is, the corner feels too open for it to threaten the white stone. I would probably have played at 'A' to backup the marked stone, or at 'B' to close up the corner.

Now that white has invaded your area, it's up to him to live. Whatever you do, try and make the most of it!]
;W[qj];B[pi]LB[qi:A]C[Although I'd be tempted to play this move myself in this situation, I think that it's a little too easy on white. Play the scary moves and you'll learn how to deal with them. In this case, the scary move is the hane at 'A'. It will start a fight, but white is the one who has to live here. By playing at 9, you're just giving white a nice chance to make a solid base on the side.]
;W[qi];B[pk];W[pl];B[qk];W[rk];B[ol];W[pg];B[qm]LB[rm:A][df:B]
[jd:C]C[This is not a good move. I would guess that it's to protect the corner, but there are certainly better ways to do that. The first one that springs to mind is 'A', although I don't think that protecting the corner is really necessary here. At the worst, white can jump a few spaces across. In the scheme of things (at this point in the game) there are far bigger things to worry about.

Give the situation here, I'd opt for ignoring the whole area and approaching somewhere. 'B' would possibly be my choice (a high approach, because your stone in the bottom left is low). The only risk with 'B' is that you might encourage a white framework along the top. If you don't like that, feel free to jump straight into the middle at 'C'. If white approaches from either side, you have plenty of room to live.

The other reason why I don't like this is because it forces white to connect (as he does next move). It's never good to have a stone dangling down, so black should really block at 'A' after white plays there. If you're going to have to play somewhere anyway, it often makes sense to play there first and get it over and done with.]
;W[rl];B[qh];W[rh];B[rj]LB[ph:A]C[I don't quite understand this move. If it was intended to kill then, well, it didn't. :) You'd be better off connecting at 'A', which gives white two directions to worry about: one is you pushing up the edge into his corner, the other is you using your thickness to jump out into the middle of the board. As it is, you achieve the thickness in the next few moves anyway.]
;W[ri];B[ph];W[qg];B[og]LB[nh:A][iq:B][dj:C][df:D][jd:E]C[This move isn't really bad, but it's a bit of a waste. If you want to move up in that direction, play at 'A'. In this situation, though, you're focusing too much on the local situation when there are huge swathes of board left unclaimed. This is a perfect chance to play at 'B' (or thereabouts) and stake a claim to the bottom side. Alternatively, you can play at 'C' or 'D' to try and build up a side facing the wall you just made. Again, as a final choice, you could play around 'E' to stop white from joining up his two corners.]
;W[of];B[mm]LB[ng:A]C[Right. This is the first move where you start to show that you're really too concerned with solid territory too early in the game. This move, and the moves that follow it, are an attempt to grab some solid territory to call your own. Unfortunately:

(a) they don't really achieve that
(b) they're actually surrounding not that much of the board as a whole (even though it is a lot of territory in itself
(c) they allow your opponent to take huge chunks of looser territory that you never get to invade
(d) a stronger player would invade them anyway

This move is also too close to your existing base of stones. My suggestions for where to move are the same as for the last move.

(As an aside, if you've played the marked stone, and got the expected follow-up of white 26, you should at least follow it up with a stone at 'A' to prevent an atari that will let your opponent lead you around by the nose.)]
;W[ch]C[Your opponent has more of the right idea, even though I'd say this was either (a) too small for an extension, or (b) too large for an enclosure. It's a classic case of them not deciding which to go for.]
;B[jn]C[Again, this isn't gaining you enough. It's timid, in a way, and still leaves you wide open to invasion on the lower side. My advice of where to move stays the same as the last few moves.]
;W[kc]C[Now white has got the top side, and a nice little framework that covers a good chunk of the board. It's invadable, but because his stones are all low on the side, he'll get something out of the invasions, and it will balance. If white had invaded you on the lower side you would have seriously lost out.

So, as a simple piece of advice: when you want territory on the edge, play on the third or fourth line. Anything above that is invadable.]
;B[go]C[Again. The bottom side seems huge, but there's plenty of room to invade. You'd end up with an shell of territory with a nice, smug white group inside it. :)]
;W[dk]C[White gets another point in what is turning into a huge framework. If he played around the centre point next, you would have had serious trouble.]
;B[em]LB[fk:A][fc:B][nc:C][ng:D]TR[og]C[This is a bit aimless. It's too high and far away to really achieve much except a vague pressure on the edge of white's group. If I'd been them, I would have jumped up around 'A' and let my framework become more and more solid.

You can still, in this position, invade at 'B'. There's loads of room. You can even invade at 'C', if you're desperate. At the worst, you still have the marked stone dangling. If you press up with it (at 'D') it will at least start to pull your own framework into something big. As it is, you could end up with a sequence like I've shown in the variation.]

(;W[cm];B[dl]LB[fk:A]C[This attempt to cut can't work, and so just solidifies white's position. If you ignore all the invasions that you should be making, you're better off playing at 'A'. That makes his framework smaller, and yours bigger.]
;W[cl];B[ek]C[This is the right idea.];W[dm];B[el];W[do]C[A bit unfortunate, this. It demonstrates why the area of "territory" that you have is too loose, though.]
;B[dn]LB[dp:A]C[No. This doesn't work, as you see later. In this situation you have to cut your losses and defend your territory. A move at 'A' would be much better. As it is, the failed attempt to cut just gives white more of the corner than he needs, and makes his overall position on your side stronger.]
;W[en];B[cn]C[Just let it go... :)];W[co];B[bn];W[bo];B[eo]

;W[ak];B[fq];W[eq];B[fr];W[er];B[dj];W[ck];B[cj];W[am];B[bj]
;W[ej]C[This fight is pretty horrible to be honest. :) You both make some errors of judgement, but overall I'd say that white comes out better. Black has completely lost his corner, and a good chunk of the side that he should have. Admittedly, the lower side has become a bit stronger (although I'd still fancy my chances to invade it), but black cannot be happy.]
;B[bk]C[This is an important point: don't play black 69. For a start, it won't work. You can see it won't work, so you shouldn't bother. More importantly, it's removing a ko-threat. If you get into a ko fight later on in the game, the move at black 69 is a lovely threat. If you play it now, for no reason, you remove that potential. 

Only take stones exactly when you need to take them, and only force your opponent to take stones when you get something out of it.]
;W[an];B[ei];W[fj];B[fi];W[gj];B[gm]TR[bk][bj][cj][dj]LB[dh:A]
C[You would have been okay not to defend this (and to save the marked stones by playing at 'A'), but I can't criticize you for avoiding the risk.]
;W[di];B[dh];W[ci];B[hi]LB[eg:A]TR[di][ch][ci]C[You should really make sure that your stones are safe before attacking. This move is too greedy. A nice shape move at 'A' would have give you something to play with, especially with the bonus of being able to threaten the marked stones. You wouldn't have been able to kill them, but it would have given you a chance to establish your group. Afterwards you can try to kill that group of three stones.]
;W[eh]C[Now you have very little.];B[gi];W[hj];B[ij];W[ii];B[ih]

;W[kf];B[jf];W[kg];B[ke];W[le];B[lf];W[je]C[How much did you pay white to make this move? ;)

This was a very, very lucky mistake for black.];B[lg];W[ef]
;B[ge];W[ff]C[White should have ignored this, and solidified territory on the top edge.]
;B[jd];W[ng]C[This would have been nice for white earlier in the game.]
;B[nh];W[oh];B[oi];W[og];B[ni];W[kd];B[ie]LB[jc:A]C[Like I said earlier: take stones only when you have to. You could have achieved a lot more by played at 'A'. The white stone would still have been dead, but you would have pushed down the edge and worried white.]
;W[me];B[jl];W[fs];B[gs];W[es];B[gr];W[hl];B[il];W[gk];B[gl]
C[Don't worry about trying to kill the eyespace. It's already alive whenever it wants. Worry more about sealing off your territory.]
;W[bi];B[fk]C[One point of territory. There are bigger places to play on the board. Even for the aspect of forcing white to take, you're better off waiting for possible kos or for the end of the game.]
;W[aj];B[hm];W[dj];B[im];W[hk];B[fe]LB[fc:A]C[Better idea, but jumping down to 'A' would have been even better, as it threatens to jump into the corner.]
;W[ee];B[ed]LB[ec:A]C[Not good. The atari at 'A' is an obvious move, and hurts a lot. It's still better to jump down a space.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[dc];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb];W[ea];B[ga]LB[jc:A][rm:B]
C[Not necessary when there are bigger points on the board. 'A' is my first example without even looking over to 'B', where there's a very painful monkey-jump waiting to bite you.]
;W[fa];B[da];W[eb]C[Unreasonable, I'd say. Very unreasonable.]

;B[cf];W[bf];B[fh];W[cg];B[jc];W[jb];B[ib];W[ka];B[ia];W[kb]
;B[mg];W[mf];B[qc]C[A bit late in the day for this. It would have been a good move around 100 moves ago!]
;W[qd]C[Luckily for you, white blocked on the wrong side.];B[pc]
;W[oc];B[ob];W[rc];B[rb];W[rd];B[sb];W[nb];B[qa]LB[pa:A]C[... and then you threw it all away! 'A' lets the group live.]
;W[pb];B[pa]C[Now it's dead. Let it die. Take the opportunity to play elsewhere.]
;W[qb];B[jq];W[oa];B[rm]C[Finally! :)];W[sj];B[sm];W[sl];B[pm]
;W[lq]C[White is being unreasonable here.];B[mp];W[lp]C[In general, I'd focus on playing solidly (and avoiding cuts) in situations like this. White doesn't have room to live, so let them thrash around while you calmly make solid walls around them. Do be careful, though. This can be a very stressful part of the game.]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[kp];W[kq];B[jp];W[ln]C[All these cross-cuts and hanes are asking for trouble, really. Solid walls.]

;B[oo];W[jr];B[iq];W[hp];B[hq];W[mk];B[nl];W[po];B[pp]C[Ouch! Wrong way. Don't push a cutting white stone down onto your weak group! Atari from the other side so that your group has plenty of room to live.]
;W[qo];B[qp]
(;W[rn]C[You're lucky again.];B[ro];W[sn];B[qn];W[so];B[sp]

A few thoughts:

1) Your worries about territory are leading you to grab onto smaller areas whilst letting your opponent get the rest of the board.

2) Don't be in too much of a rush to resolve situations on the board. If a group has "died" but is still on the board, don't take it until you need to.

3) Don't rush to atari stones just because you can. Think about whether a more solid move is there.

4) Don't try to kill groups that you know are going to live. You can attack them if it gains you something (although I'd call it "leaning" at that point), but trying to kill something out of desperation or in the hope that your opponent makes a mistake is not helpful to you or them.

5) Learn to invade. The way to do this is to try it. You will die lots when you first try, then you'll learn what works. Try it during the opening, and to an extent during the middle game. Don't make silly invasions at the end of the game, though, it's a bit rude. (You didn't do that, but I like to warn.)

6) Be prepared to pull back and let a few stones die for the greater good. If you try to keep everything, you'll lose too much.
