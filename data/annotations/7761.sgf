C[Hi mard,

I'm 4k on KGS, don't know the level equivalence for IGS.

I will do my best to answer your question and review this game but don't forget that we all have different styles and someone stronger than me could say that what I'm saying is not true.

Hope this review will help you anyway and fill free to send it back if you have another quastions after going through it.

Regards,

(;W[pn]C[Was my opening effective? Was there something I should have done that would have been more important? I admit I didn't have much of a strategy yet. Could I have read White's intentions this early and prepared or diffused them? I ended up running most of my groups towards the edge and making almost no territory, while my opponent built a strong base in the top almost immediately, then played aggressively to prevent me from doing the same.

So the question is already answered, we can't say that your moves were fatal mistakes, but they don't take into account the direction of the stones.]

the two dead sontes will be a source of ko threat so keep them for a ko

Difficult to answer your questions, as it is now the situation is good for black so can't say you did something wrong but I want to say that overplay a lot here. He has two weak groups lost in black sphere of influence, keep them separated and one at least (can be both) will die.]
;W[hl]C[Could it still be cut off after White played here? Black J7, WJ8, it looks like White has connected its wall and vulnerable group with this H8 stone.

Now that I know the outcome of the fight, would peeping his two potential eyes at L6 and M7 have been more effective, since I would have been able to connect both of those stones with safe groups? White could have then fled further towards the center and probably make life there, so perhaps it was already a lost cause and I should have tried to make moyo or invade at J16?]

If it's possible, I can't kill it, I have kept an eye on it the whole game and won't find anything to kill after he played o13]

As i said long before and as you pointed out, the problem was that your s16 group was not enough strong so you couldn't invade... now it is, but white has no weaknesses in the area anymore]

Clearly I let White gain too much territory, and my lack of strategy did not pan out. I feel I played fairly well tactically and kept my opponent on his toes (this was an hour long game), but was unable to capitalize on any of my opponents mistakes to secure a win. Despite my early strategy to play safely, I ended up playing an entirely aggressive game, and gained nothing by it. Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated, as well as any criticisms. Thank you in advance!

Bigger the group is, harder is to kill. So if you're going for murdering, just keep your opponents weak group separated.
Most of what I have to say is in the game and I hope it will be usefull for you. It was a good game but white shinogi (living in hostile area) in the center turned it into an irremiedable loss for black. There's a proverb that say you can't make more than 5 living groups on a goban, as long as I see, it was always true. If you count here, white has5 groups, so keeping his two center groups cut and you would have killed one ;).

Feel free if you have question and good continuation.])
