C[Hello, dear reviewer, and welcome to my go game, played out upon the endless depths of the goban. I am mostly interested the fighting on the upper right, and how I could have most improved there.

I am flagrantly disdainful of joseki,(actually, I don't know any, so It would be helpful to see the joseki variations that might have arisen in the beginning.), so don't you DARE show me any joseki. ;)

Now, then, onto the show!

Max- I show some possible sequences in the upper right, but I believe your problems arise much earlier. 

The primary notions I hope you come away with are that: You must strive to have your stones work together for a common plan of attack. Even in moyo games, one must keep in mind that eventually influence must pay off in territory. Capturing is a tool, not a goal

Now, on w. the lesson.];B[pd];W[dp]C[
A typical response for white. (I am white, just so you know.)]
;B[op];W[pj]C[My flagrant style displays itself. ;)

M-There is a proverb that applies here "Corners gold, sides silver, center grass." There are pros that successfully go against this rule of thumb, but they have a clear plan in their heads. 

Q10 doesn't work well with d4 and since it's on the 4th line doesn't make territory. It's also too far from any other stones to put any pressure on black.]
;B[cd]LB[pf:B][pn:A]C[M-Black takes advantage. A is game, B is another option.]

(;W[pn]C[Is this a good move, or should I have aimed larger, instead?

M- Not sure how you could play larger. E16 or e17 to keep black from securing that corner would be nice, but wouldn't work well with your q10 stone. 

I might play q14. Since it takes to more stones to secure the corner around the 4-4 point you would still have potential there if black answered and you would still have an option for invading the lower right. I show a few possible sequences.]
;B[qp]C[What are the implications of blacks move upon white? I didn't know how to attack the lower right corner, so I didn't, but it would help to know how to do so, for future reference. Thanks.

M- The problem w. attacking the corner at this point is that black will likely form outside thickness that will work against your stones on the Q line. However, I've outlined some possibilities. I show a few other sequences earlier]

(;W[dj]C[went wide.

M- This is ok.];B[ec]LB[jd:A][jp:B]
(;W[jd]LB[jp:A]C[Is this a good move?

M- I don't believe so. If you're going to play a moyo game (as going wide and playing on the 4th line indicate), I think a move at A would be best.]
;B[mc];W[gd]TR[jd]SQ[pj][pn]C[Note that none of your stones have a proper base as they are on the 4th line. Black can easily invade if he so wishes.]
;B[qg];W[fc]LB[ee:B][jp:A]C[I'm a little nervous here, and I think I may have jumped the gun by making contact to soon. Any variations?

M- This strengthens black as much as yourself and undercuts any ability to make center territory. The center is never as large as it seems and is easily reduced to begin with. A and B strike me as your best bet along those lines though. 

If you don't want to follow such a strategy and want to make territory on the sides, you should play on the third line.]
;B[ed];W[ef];B[kb];W[de]LB[fe:C][jp:B][fq:A]C[M- This is not a strong attack because f17 already strenghthened black in this area. Black could even ignore this move and  play A or B or counter attack with C.]
;B[bf];W[ce]LB[fe:C][jp:A][mq:B]C[I like this move, unfortunately, it spells my downfall later in the game. When I say SHABAM!!! that's the crucial moment.

M- I don't like this move or this sequence. It doesn't hurt black and in the end just backfires on you. A, B, and C all strike me as better moves.]
;B[be];W[dd];B[cc];W[dc];B[db]LB[eb:B][fb:A][fd:C]
(;W[fb]C[In retrospect, would it have been better to play E18? heaven knows that point becomes a pain in my butt later on.

M- No. Sorry, what becomes a pain is the cost you pay for focussing so hard on a sequence that doesn't work and wouldn't save the game for you besides.

E 18 might be usefull as a sacrifice, but better I think just tp play f16.]
;B[eb];W[jb]LB[fe:A]C[M- Better to have played at A.];B[kc]
;W[kd]C[Big mistake on my part.

M-Not really. There was really no territory to be gained at the top. You got a lucky opportunity later on in the game, but one shouldn't count on your opponent making the mistakes he did.]
;B[jc];W[lc];B[lb];W[ld];B[md];W[me];B[ne];W[ph];B[ri]LB[rh:A]
[rj:B][jp:C]C[why does black move there?

M- Couldn't say for sure. Probably looking to steal your base or just make sure you don't make much territory here. I wouldn't rate it too highly as a move.]

(;W[rh]LB[qh:A][qi:B]C[This may be a bit greedy.]
(;B[qh]C[Black should have played A before you did (see alternate sequence).]
;W[qi];B[rg];W[rj];B[sh]LB[si:A][rn:B]
(;W[si]C[This is the beginning of many careless errors in the lower right. It would be nice to see how I could have avoided the punnuki nests that come around here.

M-First thing, don't commit suicide like this. Really, this is another case of white getting into an unnecessary fight over little or no territory.]
;B[sj];W[sk];B[rk];W[si];B[ee]LB[df:A][rh:B]
(;W[df];B[sj]LB[qc:B][nd:A]C[M- The problem here is that you have no ko threats large enough. Best you can do is take a free move somewhere or two free moves at cost of r11 stone. I've laid out one possibility.]

(;W[nd];B[qj]C[cacafire [17k?\]: this early in the game?];W[nc]
C[Alenchon [?\]: in this case, yes];B[mb]C[cacafire [17k?\]: eheheh... ^.^;]
;W[nf];B[oe];W[pi];B[pk];W[ib]C[that was a neccessary move, but It might have been executed too soon. any ideas?

M- Not a necessary move. Saved a single stone and a few points in gote. And later, black still has the option of taking these stones.  Much larger moves all over the board. As I've mentioned, the possibilities you gain here later on are as much due to black's mistakes as your play. You have also eliminated the aji (potential) for invading the corner.]
;B[ic]C[M- K18 is still threatened.];W[hd]LB[hb:B][ok:A]
(;B[ok];W[ql]LB[jp:B][mq:A]C[I don't like this move. Could you suggest a better one?

M- It's already a tough game for white. A and B seem to me the best moves,.]
;B[qk];W[rl]LB[nm:A][nn:B]C[W- This move just makes white heavy. Beter to run w. A or B if you want to save these stones. Better yet, give them up.]
;B[rn];W[om]C[M- Slow move.];B[no]LB[nn:B][oo:A]
(;W[oo]C[M- This is just asking for trouble.];B[po];W[nm];B[on]
;W[pm];B[jq]C[M-Black takes key point. With holes in the perimeter white has no sure territory as yet.]

(;B[oj];W[mo];B[mp];W[lo];B[lp];W[nn];B[oo]LB[km:B][jn:A]
(;W[jn];B[ko]C[M- This exchange just creates weakenesses for white and strength for black.]

(;W[pg];B[pf];W[of];B[ni];W[qf];B[pe];W[rf]C[I was going for R13, but in retrospect, it was futile. Could really use variations on the scene developing in the upper right.]
;B[re];W[ob];B[nb];W[oc];B[qb];W[qc]C[This was a desperate move. It almost paid off. almost. >.<

M-While the game is almost entirely lost from here, the moves labelled A through F seem best to me.]
;B[sf];W[ra]LB[hb:A]C[M- Black can put an end to the trouble he faces later by simply playing A now.]
;B[mj];W[hc];B[ge];W[he];B[ff]LB[fg:A][fh:B]C[M- A is the proper answer. B is an invitation for black to invade.]

I thank Alenchon who without his skill, I would never've been able to play such a marvelous game. Ok, onto the game. lol.

Actually, this move is a rather pathetic one, and all it does is give me one point. Where would have been better?

M- Trying to save your marked group with A, or B. Or grabbing the corner w. C would be good. But quite frankly, white has no chance at this point and should resign.]

Talk about a tough game! the entire board is like a battered wasteland after a long and hearty battle. In the end, I lost by resignation. And with good reason, too. If I had been able to succeed in cappturing it, well, it would have been marvelous. But now white is a battered enemy. fractured, and smothered.

All is not lost, though. I shall rise again and smite the stronger player known as ALENCHON! LALALAOLOLOLO!!! (with your help, of course. :))

Well, dear review. We have at long last come to the end of the goban battle. I pray you will nurse my wounded soldiers(white stones) back to good health. Thank you. :*

M- I hate to burst your bubble, but as good as it would have felt to capture all those stones, it would have still been a huge loss for white.

I hope my comments will help you in your future games. I know my criticism was severe at times, but I all in the hope that you won't make the same mistakes in the future.]
