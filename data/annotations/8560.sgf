;B[pp];W[pd];B[dd]C[CG: Personally I don't like the diagonal fuseki with two 4-4 points. What's the idea of that approach? In pro games, black has a poor winning rate (<35 %).]
;W[cq];B[ep];W[do]
(;B[dp]C[probably not the best...

CG: Yes, pushing into a keima (without cutting) is bad style!
See the variations (from professional games) for alternatives.]
;W[cp];B[cm]TR[cp][dp]C[CG: Overplay! And also wrong timing!
What is the point of the marked exchange if you now play on the left side? If you want to do so, do it without the marked exchange!]
;W[eo]
(;B[gp]TR[cp][dp]C[CG: Sacrificing the two stones does not really give you an advantage compared to F4.
Compare the variation without the marked exchange.]
(;W[fp];B[fq];W[fo];B[hq];W[eq];B[cj];W[jq]
(;B[ip]TR[cp][dp]C[CG: This hurts. You don't get much in the lower left, but your lower right corner gets weaker. Without the marked exchange, you could play E2, W D3, B G2 to make life locally. However, due to the exchange white will answer at D2 now (see var.), so the situation is difficult for you.]
;W[jp];B[er];W[dr]C[CG: Good!];B[gr];W[nq]C[CG: The hane at J5 would be even better.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[mo]C[CG: What is the idea of this hane? The normal joseki is good enough.]
;W[op];B[no]
(;W[mq]C[CG: Too small - I'd prefer P3 or even P5.];B[oq];W[in]
C[CG: J5 is better.];B[io];W[jn]
(;B[hn]C[CG: I'd prefer to push through and cut to fight back now.]
;W[hm];B[gn];W[dl]C[best way to handle this?

CG: Ignore it? 
Connecting with G6 just helps white - C10 becomes weak. The strength you get is eliminated by the corner - a bad exchange.
So locally C8 or C9 are better. 
But the best move is now the cut at K5.]
(;B[dm]
(;W[cl]C[CG: Maybe an overplay.]
(;B[em];W[el];B[fm];W[fl];B[gl]C[overplay?];W[gm];B[hl]C[also wrong i think]
;W[im];B[bl];W[bk];B[bm];W[ck];B[fn];W[go];B[ho];W[jo];B[ir]
C[CG: Why do you answer? G2 is one eye, and you get a second eye either with J2/J3 or B5.

Playing an unnecessary gote move at this stage loses a game easily!]
;W[jr]C[CG: Not sente!]
(;B[iq]C[unnecessary? b has one eye here and can make on on the left, so lives in miai?  i saw this during the game, but was lazy to read it

CG: Yes, see my previous comments. 
Lazyness is a bad excuse! 
If you want to improve, you have to THINK and READ in situations like this!!]
;W[bj];B[ci];W[bi];B[ch];W[fj]C[CG: Good.]
(;B[hj]TR[ch][ci][cj]C[CG: Bad. The marked stones are too weak to kill the white group, and if you can't kill, pulling out the stones makes no sense (you should not pull them out just to save two stones or four points!).]
;W[fh];B[ei]C[too slow?

CG: It does not really help your stones on the left, and it hurts your center stones. Yes, it's a bad move.]
;W[fi];B[ej];W[gk];B[il];W[hh];B[kl];W[df]C[unexpected... is there a way to link?

CG: Unexpected? Hm.
But yes, you can link up with C14, albeit with a ko in this case.]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[de];W[cg]
(;B[bf]C[CG: D13 is the only move.];W[dg];B[bg];W[bh]C[black gets the corner, but all the same, this was a loss, right?

CG: Yes, game over.];B[ff];W[fg]C[CG: Bad - this only helps black. Simply E12 is better as it leaves aji (E15, F16, etc.).]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[nc];W[ic];B[kc];W[fc];B[ec];W[eb];B[db]
(;W[fb]C[CG: White should link up with E16.];B[qf]C[is this wrong direction?  should black instead press on J3?

CG: Since you are behind, playing such "normal" moves and waiting for mistakes is maybe the best strategy (if you don't want to resign yet).]
;W[pf];B[qe]
(;W[pe];B[qd];W[oc];B[qc];W[nb];B[id];W[jc];B[kd];W[jd];B[kf]
;W[je];B[ke];W[mc];B[jh];W[cb]TR[bf][cf][bg]C[another unexpected move - is it reasonable?

CG: No, I think it's quite reasonable. It makes much better use of C15 than just capturing the (unimportant) three stones.
You should take into account that with C15 your corner is not as safe or as big as it might appear.]
(;B[cc];W[da];B[bb];W[dc]C[playing ko doesnt look like a good idea, right?

CG: Yes.];B[bd];W[ed];B[ee];W[nd]C[seems very slow, but how to take advantage?

CG: Hm, it's a declaration of victory. 
Now that the group is alive, white just needs to live somehow in the lower right. 
If you want to win, you need to make the most of it - so ...]
(;B[if]C[pitiful... i am ashamed i played this

CG: Hm, yes.
I think the only way to win is to attack the weak white group with P2 (a BIG sente move!!!) and than enclose the lower right.]
(;W[jf]C[luckily white responded :)

CG: Yes - white should have played like in the variation.];B[jg]
;W[ig]C[and again!  it is dispiriting to lose against this kind of play]
;B[ih];W[hg]
(;B[qj]C[maybe not the right place?

CG: No, you should see that P2 is a big sente move to be played first!]
;W[ql]C[CG: Hard to kill.];B[qn];W[ol];B[oj];W[mm];B[nl];W[nm]
;B[om];W[pm]C[CG: Bad - a minus.];B[on];W[nk];B[ml];W[ok];B[pk]

C[i think both sides played this weakly];W[mk];B[li];W[or];B[mh]
C[was this necessary?  it let white take the bottom right

CG: If it is, you can't win. So better to answer in the corner and see.]
