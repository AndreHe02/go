;B[qd]C[Hello, I am your reviewer, Xinwen.
I have not been playing Go for quite sometimes, sorry if the review isn't good.
This is a good game by both of you.

Extra Infor, this review is done by Xinwen and Lork. Both of us shared our thoughts trying to make this review better in different view points.]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[jp];W[qj]LB[oc:B][od:A]TR[jp]C[I'm not sure what is a good more here. I guess there is nothing fundamentally wrong with R10. Perhaps O3 would work but perhaps a bit slow.

Xinwen :::
Hmmm...
If i were black, i would move A or B instead of K4 because of enclosure.
Moving at K4 wasn't a mistake but it does not secure your territory, you still leave an invasion point.

If i were white, R10 would be okay. although i don't know what is the best move since Fuseki is my weakest part, sorry to tell ^^^||
But definitely moving at O3 is not a wise choice at this point.]

(;B[qn]TR[qj]C[Lork ::: 

I don't think R6 is a good move for black because of D10. Black should comes from O3.]

i think its worth to try but my thought is that, you create another weak group because he has one already. wise to strengthen D6 first]

(;B[eq]C[Xinwen:::

I don't like the black here, black will definitely lose something out of this because black helps white to strengthen the F3.]

[gj:A][qj:D]C[Xinwen:::

Black lead already. you don't have enough thickness compared to him.
the reason you lose because you were to concern about destroying the territory on the bottom.

and the A B C exchanges were weird, because after A, black C creates a thickness. your A group still need to run and this result the B exchange was bad.

your D group weak = A weak.
M17 area now expose to attack.

Now as you compare, black has much secured territory than yours.So this game is decides]

That's about it i guesss, there are rooms for improvement of course.

Sorry again for taking so long to review this game, because at my level i see things differently and can't say it out what's the best because i haven't learn what is the best for the game. Thus, i can only tell you what i think of it.

This game has been reviewed by Xinwen and Lork. 
At any rate, you can find us in Brunei Room under National.

Thank you


Sorry can't give you too much advice because.. .yes, everyone need to improve in any part of the Go. 
I can see your fuseki and joseki really need to improve. 

Kay, best of luck
