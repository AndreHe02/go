C[Hi

I was black in this game. Apart from a clear mistake at the end of the game when I stopped thinking (a bad habit) I think my play was ok, but white would have won even without it, so I would appreciate any comment on strategy, tactics and anything that comes to your mind. Guess most of my bad plays occured on the right side, but you surely know better. At some points I added a few questions.]
;B[pd];W[dc]
(;B[qp]C[This move (while nothing really wrong with it) seems off to me. Maybe just my style but i think Q3 may be better
Check the branches to give you an idea.
R3 is uninteresting.];W[dq]C[Now if you look at R3 you can see that it doesn't look like its facing the right direction. It doesn't provide much influence in attacking white's side]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj];W[cm];B[oq]C[too submissive. O3 would be better and still give you enough strength.]
;W[qj]
(;B[ql]C[Here you're extending from strength forcing him to R13 which is weakening your Q16 stone. The lower right is yours and you don't need to worry about it.]
;W[qg];B[qe];W[og];B[nd];W[jq];B[ok];W[oi];B[jc]C[Thats big. But whites corner needs to be harassed.]
;W[mq]
(;B[ck]C[hmm should black have played E7 himself?
-E7 is no good really as white will just D5
C9 helps white];W[em];B[no]C[Doesn't put any pressure on white.]
;W[jo];B[dn]C[The white moyo began looking too big, so I wanted to probe a little, and then try something between a reduction and a invasion...
-A good start i guess];W[dm]
(;B[eq]C[wrong side i think all black has here is possible life in the corner]

C[I was not sure here whether to defend at Q6 or to aim at the center and keep the white groups divided
-Q6 would of been bad. again too submissive];W[ll];B[ik];W[hr]
;B[er]C[not necessary?
-Not really but its big and later you would have C2
probably just bad timing];W[lk];B[mj];W[qm];B[pm];W[qn]

-yes];W[rd];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[pa];W[qa];B[se];W[sd]
;B[rg];W[qh];B[ri]C[S11 bad because it ruined the sente play at S5?
-also small];W[rj];B[sb];W[rb]C[I thought I could attack the S10 group by letting the conrner live (which I tried to kill anyway) and getting thick, but it didn't really work out]
;B[mg]C[So the next plan was to shut it in
-its alive but this is good move anyway.starting to develop a moyo]
;W[nr];B[fi];W[hd]C[H16 is important for black as it would work well with N13]
