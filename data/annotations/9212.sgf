C[Dear reveiwer,

Thank you for taking the time to review my game. I promise to take the time to study your review thoroughly. My main interest at Go right now is to keep improving.

I played black in this game. I lost by 5.5 points. It was a very territorial game and I had a hard time finding good plays for making territory. It was hard to visualize where I had potential and where I could play to make territory. Help me pointing out the biggest plays that I missed.

I also had several opportunities to cut my opponents groups and start a fight, but I didn't. Please let me know if I should have played in a more bold way.

Any other comments are well received.

Thank you,
memolano

J: Hi I'm Jay, I'll be reviewing your game.  My comments begin with "J:".]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq];W[qj];B[qf]SQ[qg][qh]C[J: R12 or R13 is more aggresive here and worrth more points.  You want to take away white's space for making a base.]
;W[qm];B[de]
(;W[gc]C[This answer surprised me, but I think I played ok after this.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[ch]LB[ck:A]TR[ci]C[I know this is a little bit tight, but I didn't want to play at the triangle because I didn't want to give white the opportunity to approach at A in sente. Is white A sente? do I have to respond?

J: The point of C12 is so that E14 is not sente in another joseki, see variation.  Either way (C11 or C12) an approach from the bottom side is sente for white.  In this case, since B17 is open to white, I would prefer a move at D12 instead, because black is not getting points anyway, so black may as well just play for influence.]
;W[cn]C[J: white is slow here, should be at C10.];B[jq]C[J: K3 is a big point, couls be one line over at J3.]
;W[mq]C[I thought that this was kind of an overplay by white, jumping in the middle of your opponen't strength. The sad part is that I wasn't able to take advangate of it. Can you show me a better play to attack this white invading stone?

J: white is wayyy too deep.  One idea is to lean against the white group on the right for attack.  See variation.]

(;B[oo]C[Here I aim at separating the stone for its nearst group.

J: Black is strong, but it feels slow.  Black can lean on the white group on the right.  See variation.]
;W[mo]
(;B[gq]TR[jo]C[Now I want to make a base for my bottom group.

J: Now that white is out, it's hard to attack white.  Can conside K5 first, see variation.]
;W[eq];B[lp]C[I thought about forcing to connect, but he didn't.]
;W[lq]C[This looked strange to me. Should I have pushed and cut? I'm kind of affraid of the second variation here... what if he isolates my bottom stones?]

(;B[kq];W[mp];B[ko]TR[om]C[J: white is heavy now, and has only one eye on the bottom, so keep white separated with P7.  Don't worry about M4, it's not important.]
;W[nr];B[or];W[ro];B[rp];W[qo];B[po]C[Don't know if this was necessary, but my corner started to look weak.]
;W[kn]
(;B[jn]TR[ln]C[J: now that the right side is strong, have you considered cutting at the other direction at M6? Remember that M4 doesn't matter.  See variation.]
;W[lo];B[kp];W[ip]C[J: odd.];B[iq];W[hp];B[ln];W[km];B[lm];W[nm]
;B[kl];W[jm]C[J: The saying is: "every step played in a bad ladder is a loss of 7 points."]
;B[im];W[nn];B[jc]TR[eh][jl]C[J: I would either take K8 or strengthen E12 now.  Black does not want to give white forcing moves to attack C12 group. See variation.

J: If you were going to play in that area, it should be at J17. Aiming to poke at white's group.]

(;W[pb]C[I tought for a while here. I couldn't decide if I should give him the corner and take the outside or give him the outside and take the corner. I went for the corner. What do you think about that?]

(;B[qc]TR[pc]C[J: Q17 is the normal, more aggressive way to take the corner.   See variation.]
;W[nc]C[J: white should be at N17 instead];B[lc];W[ne];B[md]
;W[nd];B[kf]LB[lf:A]C[This move was just careless. I should have probably played A. to have a better shape.

J: correct, A is better.];W[le];B[me];W[kd]
(;B[jd]TR[lf]C[J: should just be at M14.];W[kc];B[kb];W[lf]
;B[ke]TR[mf]C[J: L15 hurts black.  should just peep out with N14]
;W[ld];B[mc];W[mf]LB[jb:D][nf:A][of:C][mg:B]C[I want to cut at A so bad, but it looks like a very close capturing race for my lower stones if he plays B, I extend to C and he cuts at D. What do you think?

J: The cut at A looks like it works.  See variation.]
(;B[mb];W[of];B[qb];W[pc];B[ck]LB[ie:A]TR[kg]C[I was between the move I played and A. I wanted to defend those two stones, but extending on the side looked so big. Which move should I have played?

J: If you want to defend the cut, L13 is a bigger move as it keeps the pressure on white's top group.]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[je]
(;B[ie]C[J: black doesn't need to give up L14 here.  Black can live locally.  See variation.]
;W[jf];B[hb]C[Making my group alive];W[hc];B[ic];W[gb];B[ia]
;W[qg]C[What a severe attack.

J: black should have no problems with this.   White can also just take L13 and be strong.]
;B[rg];W[qe];B[re];W[pf];B[rf];W[pe];B[qh];W[qd];B[rd];W[pg]
;B[ph];W[ri];B[rh];W[oj];B[mk]TR[bc][kg][gp]C[Here I wasn't very concerned about him making to much center territory because I got to play this move.

J: N9 is a very small move.  If you think you're ahead, just capture at K8 to be safe. The triangled points are bigger.]
;W[mi]C[J: slow];B[gp];W[hn];B[go];W[ho];B[gl];W[gn];B[fn];W[fm]
LB[gm:A]C[Another big decision. Should I cut at A and engage in a capturing race? I played "safe".

J: The cut at A just works.]
(;B[eo];W[en];B[fo];W[gm];B[em];W[dn];B[el]C[J: black had too many cutting points now.]
;W[fl];B[gk];W[fk];B[gj];W[ek];B[cm]C[J: C7 doesn't work, should be at D8.  See variation.]

(;W[dk];B[cl];W[cj];B[bj];W[di];B[bi];W[dh];B[dg];W[eg];B[df]
;W[fi]
(;B[do]TR[kg]C[Now I played away to try to get something in the corner, but It didn't work. I wonder if I should have harassed the running group more. What do you think?

J: definately.  The white group is not alive yet.  Can think about pulling out L13 to attack on a large scale.

J: D5 makes black lose liberties.];W[co];B[fr]LB[hq:A]C[With this move I mainly wanted to fix my cut if white pushed at A. I was happy that I found a double purpose move taking a little bit out of the side.]
;W[er]TR[es]C[J: black just play E1 sente first to prevent white from playing H2 later.  See variation.]

(;B[eb]C[Wanted to destroy the eyeshape, but he ended up connecting upwards anyway.]
;W[ec];B[fb];W[fc];B[ga];W[db];B[fa];W[fe]
(;B[ef]C[J: black F14 is a better way to disconnect.  See variation.]
;W[ff];B[fg];W[gg];B[eh];W[gh];B[bc]C[It looked like a big endgame point.]
;W[ac];B[ad];W[ab];B[pa];W[nb];B[na];W[ob];B[so]TR[pk]C[J: black can poke at Q9 to see what happens.]
;W[sn];B[rn]TR[qm]C[I didn't realize that due to the marked stone he could counter atari. I'm happy that I learned this.

J: this is actaully very dangerous, as white can make a large ko.  see later.]
;W[sp];B[qn];W[rm];B[so];W[ro];B[qo]
(;W[so]TR[sq]C[J: white can play T3 instead of connecting T5 to start a ko to reduce black's corner.]
;B[sq];W[sm];B[rq];W[pm];B[ok];W[nk];B[nl];W[nj];B[ol];W[pn]
;B[oh]TR[ji]C[Center started looking big. I should have played from the other side.

J: Yes, the center is big for both sides.];W[ki];B[jj];W[ik]
;B[jl]C[J: too safe.  Should play J10 instead to take everything.]
;W[ij];B[ii];W[ji];B[jk];W[hi];B[ih];W[hj];B[hl]C[J: black lost some points here, but....]
;W[if]C[Now he really made points in the center.]
(;B[fj]C[J: but then black misses a big chance to take it back.  Black can play G11 instead.  see variations.]

J:  This game was close up into the endgame, and both sides made endgame mistakes; just that white made less.

J: I think the take away from this game is that black can practice more reading.  This can be done through go problems.  Secondly, be mindful of the direction of play.  There were many instances of black letting white off too easy: ie the top bottom and left white groups.  When attacking, attack with purpose.
