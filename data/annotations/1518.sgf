C[Dear Duumvir,

Most of my comments will deal with the theme "Attack and Defence", as this is, where you probably can improve rapidly. (You know, what severe attacking moves are, but you have to learn, how to use them.)

At the comment of move 66 (M8)  you ask, if you should try to kill the group. The thinking behind this question is wrong. You should either kill the group (not "try to"); then you have to read out, that the group is really dead after your move. Or you should attack the group. When attacking, you should keep in mind, that attacking moves are means, rather than ends. Always think, that the group, you are attacking will live later. This implies, that the good attacking moves have some other value, some sideeffects, e.g. building territory.

When playing a defensive move, you should always ask yourself, what happens if you omit this move, and why it is so important to play this move. (See move 73 and move 75, your "loosing moves").

I also included a broad analysis of the life and death of the white bottom group (moves 28 - 50), maybe, it will be of some use for you.

In the endgame, sometimes, I've pointed out a locally better move without any comment (there might be globally better points, I've not looked for them).

I hope, you'll enjoy.

Berni];B[pp]C[Berni: If you want to be polite, you should play in the upper right corner (Q16).]
;W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[jd]C[Berni: Hmm. This move doesn't feel good. I'd prefer J3 or J4 (chinese opening) or E3, E4 or F3 (the traditional way of playing in the opening). But if you want to play at the top, you should play K17, which makes miai of N17 and G17.

To look at it from the other side: This stone doesn't work well together with your other two stones.]
;W[qn];B[nq];W[gc]C[Duumvir: i think white must re-inforce his r6 stone or attack the black stone more aggressively.  black doesn´t have to react to the w g17 move and can therefore go on the attack at w r6

Berni: Re-inforcing would be a good idea. But G17 is good too, because it punishes you for playing on the 4th line. Also, white can live in the corner with R3 and use R6 as a sacrifice.]
;B[ql]
(;W[on]C[Berni: I think, that this move isn't a good one, but I'm still too weak, to tell you why. If white wants to play in this area,  he should play R3 (see variation)]
;B[ol]C[Duumvir: now black feels quiet comfortable.];W[kq]C[Duumvir: with the next move black can attack two weak groups!

Berni: This is an overplay from white. Should be N6.];B[mo]
C[Berni: This is called a splitting attack. Black attacks both groups with one move. Very good.]
;W[nm]C[Berni: Correct.

Now, where to attack, and which group to attack?

First, as Q16 is a white stone, the P8 group is weak and the Q4 group is strong (Should live easily.) Second, both white groups are weak, but white might use L3 as a sacrifice.
Conclusion: The group to attack is O7.

Now, where to attack? From above (O8, N9 or so), from left (M7), or a more sofisticated attack? To answer this question, one has to take into account, how strong the attacks are, and what sideeffects they have.

Above: Black will get a wall, but without a stone at R14 or so, this wall will be useless. Indeed, white can still attack this wall. If black continues with R14, white will connect O7-group to L3 group, so this group get's much stronger.

Left: Black M7, white N8,  black H3. (See variation at M7 of next move.) Result: Black maps out a large mojo (marked with X in the variation), but the drawback is, that now white can attack the two stones at P8, which will lead to an equal sized moyo at the top. (Maybe the black group will live, but the wall, white gets from attacking will work well with D16 and G17.)

More sophisticated attack: A so called leaning attack at K4. This move attacks L3, and if white doesn't answer K3 will map out a large territory at the bottom. But if white answers, this is also an attack at the O7-group, because after N9, white has to run out, so black has the time to play at R14. (See variation at K4 of next black move.)]

(;B[mk];W[lm];B[ko]C[Duumvir: Again, black attacks two white groups, and feels very satisfied with the beginnining of this game]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[rp]
(;B[hq]C[Duumvir: i thought long about this... how to attack more effectively? maybe k4 to build a wall? i wanted to try to kill the white stone here.

Berni: It's the wrong group. L3 is only one stone, white can afford to sacrifice it. Attacking the large group is better (see variation).]
;W[po]C[Berni: Good. This is the important point. White has now almost two eyes.]
;B[pq]C[Berni: P4 looks better.];W[np];B[mp];W[op];B[oq]C[Berni: Defending at N3 looks better.]
;W[jp]C[Berni: O5 and the white group is alive. If black captures L3, white has sente to attack N9-group. If black defends N9 group, K4 is still possible, but this time, black can't start a splitting attack any more.]
;B[in]C[Duumvir: is this the correct anwser?

Berni:Looks good, probably J5 is a little bit better.];W[iq]
;B[hp]C[Duumvir: i didn´t want to make the tigers mouth at h4...

Berni: Correct. This move also has an good effect on the black moyo at the left.]
;W[mr];B[mq]C[Berni: After this move, white is alive, so black should look for alternatives: O6 threatens to capture at P5 and to cut at P7, but black probably will loose the resulting semeai. M2 might work too.

To the following moves, I've often added alternatives, to see, if the white group is dead or alive.]

(;W[lq]C[Berni: With M2 white is alive (see variations). With M3 white is alive with ko, which is a loss. (see variations of the next move.)]
;B[nr]
(;W[lr]C[Berni: White is dead, has to play at M1, to get a ko (see variation).]

(;B[jr]C[Berni: Advice for killing groups: If you don't know for sure, that your move is a killing move, you should not attack from inside, but from outside. The reason is: If you fail to kill, the moves inside the group are worthless, while the moves on the outside have other use too.

After H2 white is dead, (see variations).];W[ir]
(;B[ms];W[hr];B[gr];W[gq];B[fq];W[hs]
(;B[gp]C[Duumvir: no good answer by black, see var.2];W[js]
;B[ks];W[ls];B[is];W[jo]C[Duumvir: must black answer this move? or should he play k1, to steel white his eyes?

Berni: Steeling the eye would be a wasted move, as white will run out with K6 and will manage to live somehow.]
;B[kn];W[js]
(;B[km]MA[kk]C[Duumvir: i wanted to have compensation for the loss of the fight at the bottom and go on the attack of the other white group.  i had the feeling that this was a quiet reasonable plan to do at this moment.  is this move the best attacking move? maybe a move round the cross would have been better?

Berni: There is still a ko and your wall at the left side is good (imagine a black stone at C10). So you can't say, that there was a loss at the bottom. See variation for the strategy, you should use now.]
;W[kr];B[rm];W[rn];B[pm]C[Berni: This move doesn't threaten anything.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[pn]C[Berni: Better at O4. After O4 white is alive.]
;B[nn]C[Duumvir: i had to stop white from making two eyes here

Berni: Yes, that's what I'm telling since 33 moves...];W[om]
C[Duumvir: after this move a atari is near at hand with a following up atari at s8, so i had to answer this move i think...

Berni: It is possible, not to answer, see variation at C14.

But, if you want to answer, R7 is better. The reason is white S9, as you can see later in this game.]

(;B[pl];W[nl];B[nk];W[ll]C[Duumvir: a very deciding point in this game as far as i can see.  what should black do here? should he play a move round d10 or at r 14 to sketch out some territory and go later on the attack?  or should he still try to kill the white group? it became quiet big at this point in the game and "big groups do not die"
but my feeling was that the white group should die...
maybe i should have played L 10? (see var.2)
after this analyzes, i think this is for the first time that i see, that there is a certain DIRECTION for a good attack, and that i failed at this point! L10 seems to be the killing move.

Berni: As far, as I can see, L10 kills the group. But white will be able to run into the leftside with the bottom group. See continuation of var. 2.

So I would play an other strategy: C14 looks good. This will map out a large moyo at the left side. As far, as whites group is very weak, white can't attack your stones arround O9. After white runs out with L9, you can continue your attack. See variation, starting with C14.]

(;B[jk];W[mn];B[no];W[lk]
(;B[mi]C[Duumvir: maybe i was too frightened for the group on the right side. i thought i had to stabilize them and that i couldn´t afford to play a hane at m10 (see var. 2 at move m9)
but even after the analyzes i think that a hane is too unstable and white can attack the right group.

Berni: Hane is better.];W[lj]
(;B[ni]C[Berni: Very slow move. Black has to map out territory and will have an easy win. (C14 or R14). (I guess, that C14 will give you a lead of about 30 points or more.)

Question: What happens, when white cuts at N10? See variation!]
;W[dj]C[Berni: Now, leftside territory is gone.]
(;B[ik]C[Duumvir: i was again frightened, that white could cut here (see var.)

Berni: Again a slow move. Now try to estimate the score.

Black bottom right is roughly same as the two white groups.
Bottom left and right group together are roughtly the same, as white will get with top left and top right.

As I mentioned at the beginning, this and the preceeding move were your loosing moves. (Actually, this isn't true. It's still equal result, but before this moves your were over 30 points ahead, so it can be seen as a loss.)

You do not have to fear a cut here, because both of your groups are alive!]
;W[li];B[pf]C[Duumvir: At this point i decided that it was important to make some territory here, even if i would fail to kill the white group

Berni: Good idea, but a little bit too late...];W[lg];B[md]
C[Berni: What was the reason for this move? It makes the stone at K16 heavy, without helping to live. D13 looks better (now you have to fight...)]
;W[je]C[Duumvir: How to react to this move?

Berni: This move strengthens black. Where to play? L16, L15, J16 or J17 are all good.]
;B[ke];W[jf]
(;B[lh]C[Berni: There is a go proverb: Don't go hunting, when your house burns. You should first defend your group at the top. J17 or something like this.]
;W[kh];B[mh];W[kf]C[Berni: Should be at K11, than M12 was only a helping move for white.]
;B[ki];W[kj];B[ji];W[jj]
(;B[hi];W[ij]
(;B[ii]C[Duumvir: to block w with h10 doesn´t seem to make sense]
;W[hj];B[fi];W[hk]
(;B[im]C[Duumvir: i don´t know why i played this. Maybe g 10 would have been better (s.var 2)]
;W[gm]C[Duumvir: now the cut at h 5 threatens b. i thought i had to defend it

Berni: No need to defend. Your groups are both alive. If you feel uncomfortable of the right group, after(!) the cut you can play P5.]
