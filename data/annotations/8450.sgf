C[Dear Reviewer,

the following game is rather quiet. I think black got some advantage, but at the end the score is even - and i have no idea, which mistakes i commited. This is a general issue for me at the moment...in my games must be a lot of moves an e.g. 5kyu would surely never make, but i find it hard to point them out myself...

I added some questions during the game, where i simply would like to know if my feeling or opinion is correct. Can you briefly explain where i'm wrong and why?

Thanks in advance!


JJ: Hello Thomas, I'm Juan Jesus (JJHaggar in KGS), I'll try to answer your questions as well as I can.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
(;B[dj]TR[de][pj]C[JJ: I think these 2 moves are better. With D10 you let white take the initiative and you don't get too much in exchange (D15 attacks the corner and mantains the initiative, and although Q10 loses the initiative it gets a lot of influence on the right side and toward the center). I'll put 2 possible variations.]

(;B[cg]TR[jd]C[JJ: You approached from the wrong side. White's "wall" is aiming to the upper side of the board, so he would like to jump around K16]

;W[qf]C[In the game i now pincered with R12, but i assume now R15 would be better (see sample variation). w R17 as in the game was too good for white?!

JJ: I thing you could have attacked O3, as a leaning attack, so you strengthen your group and later you can attack strongly Q9]

;B[gg]C[I assume this cut is better then E7?
I thought about E7, because it's a junction point betwen the black and white territories - reducing whites prospects, threatening the C7 stones and giving black the chance to make some points around F10.

Is this correct? Or rather completely unresonable and this move is unimportant at the moment??

JJ: I think it is a reasonable and at this moment maybe the best move for black. Also it's unreasonable for white trying to save those 2 stones]

Could you make a short comment about this situation?

Think i have to read something about the principles of capturing races...any hints about good sources about this issue?!

JJ: You should read before important fights like this one, but it's also really important/good that you can rely in your instinct, so you should be proud of your fighting instinct :)]

During the game i had the feeling the margin should have been greater. Before the white center moyo got closed i thought i should lead by about 15 points. But the more we came to the end, the closer it seemed....

Did i play the endgame that bad?
Did i blunder in the middle game?
Or was it in general wrong to assume i lead??


Thanks for reviewing!

JJ: You are welcome. You played well but you also were lucky! 1,5 points!! :) 
Some bad Yose moves could have meant your defeat, but the real mistake was in the middle game, you shouldn't have let him close his Moyo (it was too big).
I hope I have helped you a bit, greetings, JJ])
