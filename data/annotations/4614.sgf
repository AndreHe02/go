AB[pd][dp]C[Jay: Hi, Richard, most games sent for review are the ones that are lost, so players learn their mistakes.  This game you won confortablly by a large margin.  This is an interesting game with a lot of mid-game fighting, typical of hanicap games.  There are chances on both sides through the course of fightings.  Presumablly, you would like to know better moves, so I will point out alternatives and will review for both sides.  W made more mistakes and lost the game in the end.]

Jay: This is unusual.];B[po];W[nq];B[qk]C[black gets a nice extention

Jay: Yes, this is commonly played with a star stone. So, B is better.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pi]C[Looks premature, but I dont exactly how to approach this.  He can't extend on the side to build a base, but other than that I don't know for sure what is going on.

Jay: This is not a good move for W. It's doing nothing, and it's too early as an invasion.  W may be under pressure of extra handi stone.  But, two handi doesn't have a big lead.  Your response is fine.]
;B[ok];W[ni];B[nf]C[Jay: If you want to attack, O15 may be better.  It serves to attack both the right group and O17 stone.  Otherwise, taking corner by playing Q18 is big.]
;W[me]C[Jay: This exchange favors W.]
(;B[li]C[Okay I will try to knock it on the head.  Justified?

Jay: capture looks unlikely.  Taking away the base is better for profit and punishing W's premature move at Q11.  This is ok too.]
