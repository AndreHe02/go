SpenceR [2k?\]: good game
JFR [6k\]: ah, back when I was 7k, lol
SpenceR [2k?\]: so i beat dan on a 6 stone the other day!
JFR [6k\]: nice !
SpenceR [2k?\]: yea, it was pretty interesting
SpenceR [2k?\]: we played on about the same time constraints as these

Rib: It's first time doing a reaviw like this, but hopefully I can explain things clearly  ;)]

;B[cn]LB[dn:A]C[JFR [6k\]: this sequence is not so good for black? because I don't have a stone already at C/D 10?

Rib: If one plays f4 there should be a stone around d10, otherwise it isn't very effective (not joseki, white will be silghtly favorable). A is more common.]
(;W[go]C[SpenceR [2k?\]: i'm wondering if this was ok?

(;B[fm]C[Rib: Maby tenuki here?];W[df];B[ch];W[cj]TR[eh]C[JFR [6k\]: jump out?

Rib: hm, not really just left some important moves out.
Those 4 stones aren't very important hence white is already alive.]

JFR [6k\]: because I only won by like 15 points
SpenceR [2k?\]: what move should i have played here?

Rib: Well, if you read my comment from before you should be able to understand "why" you lost so much of your handicap. When... top left corner was a catastophe :).

Upper right seems to be easy to invade.]

Rib: From this point just midgame fighting and endgame techniques, (tesuji + endgame can be learned from problem books and such)
