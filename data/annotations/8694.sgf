AB[pd][dp]C[I played white in this game. I thought I played well most of the time, but there were times when I couldn't decide on the best move - and other times where I couldn't even find a move that I thought was decent.

In my fuseki I usually emphasize speed and thickness over safety and territory (respectively). I find that most of my games are decided by how well I attack an opponents invading group. When games develop in other ways (In this game I tried to play moves I am not as comfortable with, to experiment/challenge myself) I sometimes don't know how to proceed. Most of my games do not make it to the yose phase, so sometimes I feel uncertain of myself in that stage of the game as well.

forfun (hereafter ff) - This is an interesting game and must have been fun to play. Clearly White thought hard during the game and has studied the result prior to asking for a review. At the same time, there are limits on how fruitful it is to study games we play against weaker players. We all want to play good, strong Go. When we play against weaker players, our Go can look stronger than it really is. In reviewing this game, a lot of the comments are about what Black could have done differently rather than White. Why is that? I hope that by showing stronger alternatives for Black, we can more clearly understand where White could and should have done better.

Overall I think that White deserves praise for wanting and seeking to keep up the pressure throughout the game. Like all of us, White made some mistakes here and there in shape, direction, etc. However, throughout they were mistakes while trying to play actively. That is a good sign!]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[ec];B[df];W[id];B[nq];W[nc]C[I am trying to develop quickly, to complicate the game and make up for the two stones]
;B[qf]
(;W[ck]C[I thought a lot about this move. I don't know if it is in the right place on the left side, but I like it because the two space extension in either direction threatens the other black group.

I didn't think the right side was as big as the lower and left side - so I didn't want to play R7 or something in that direction - and if I pincered on the bottom I was worried that I would end in gote if black jumped in the corner- and my influence would not be useful. I also worried that black might jump out, and while I handled my pincer stone black would seal the left side - and I wouldn't  have enough territory to win... I don't know if that is good logic.

ff - In the beginning of a handicap game, it is not possible for White to immediately equalize unless your opponent makes a significant mistake. In that case the handi is probably too small so there is no point in that case either. A key to handicap Go is to work on understanding the remaining potential in each position and playing so that you have more future possibilities than your opponent. Here it seems that White is overthinking. Splitting the side this way looks tame. It does not look bigger than answering in the bottom right. If Black played R6 now, how would White answer? Black responds here, but Black handles the flow of the game on the left side in a very reasonable way in my opinion.]
(;B[dc]C[I think this move is bad for black? It strengthens white's thin upper side and, if black plays C7, white C12, this exchange does not solve the weakness at C15?

ff - I think this is natural for Black. After this exchange Black can still invade at various points on the upper side. By giving White E16, Black takes the corner and also makes the next play, at C11, a dual-purpose stone since it both attacks White and protects C15.]
;W[ed];B[ci]C[ff - Good flow for Black.];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[fq]
;W[jp]C[I liked this direction rather than playing on the right...

ff - Since B played low in the lower left at F3, it is not so easy to develop this area. Of course R14 is also low so in one sense there are no really urgent areas. However, the right side between R14 and Q4 is wider than the bottom side between F3 and O3.]
(;B[no]C[ff - Black plays up (or should play up) in order to attack K4. Since the C6 group is weak, this would be a powerful idea for Black. It could turn out that K4 is an overplay for White. In the game, Black plays much more passively. However, that does not mean that White's plan was good. Rather it means that Black was not strong enough to push White to the limit.]
;W[pn];B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[kr]C[ff - A very passive play by Black. Basically Black passes.]
;W[qj]C[ff - Actually White gives Black a second chance with this overextension. It should be at R9 instead.]
(;B[pb];W[ne]C[I think this exchange is bad for black... Whites shape at the top was strange and not feels safer...]
(;B[ff]C[This move seemed to threaten white, but it didn't seem to help black's shape too much... with C11 already in place, connecting on the bottom seemed more important.

Not that I know whether my moves were good up to this point - but after black played here I wasn't sure where to play... Eventually I decided on trying to split black on the lower side...

ff - I agree with your assessment of this play. Black has played away from the more urgent areas along the bottom. White should not answer this now.]
(;W[hq]C[ff - Probably an overplay, although in handicap Go White has to force the pace somewhere.]
;B[fo]C[I think this move makes my H3 look like it was from the wrong direction. I considered this answer before I played H3, but this move looks better on the board than it did in my head...

ff - You are correct. This move strengthens the corner while separating your stones. White should have gotten into trouble here.]
;W[cq]C[I thought a lot about playing this move... I expected black to let me settle my group on the left - after which the central stones will be hard to handle...

I thought that if black blocked, it would hurt the left side but I could play E4 and connect/attack black and try to settle both groups that way...

ff - White voluntarily creates a third, although temporary :-), weak group. But it is rather hard for White to recover from the H3/F5 exchange.]
;B[bo];W[ep]C[I thought that if black cut at E5 white could still make something - but looking at it now, this looks like an overplay, which means C3 was bad.]
;B[eq];W[eo];B[dq];W[fp];B[gp];W[gq]
(;B[en]C[ff - A bad mistake by Black IMHO. Just connecting is better.]
;W[do]
(;B[gn]
(;W[hp]C[ff - Is this the wrong order? In the game, Black answers E7 with F7. If White plays E7 first, will Black hane or connect?]
;B[go];W[em];B[fm];W[cp];B[cr];W[fr]C[ff - The question is which White stones are weaker.]
(;B[er]C[ff - This creates a cut at G2 but allowing B6 in sente is painful.]
;W[es];B[dr];W[bn];B[bq]
(;W[el]
(;B[hl]C[ff - Half-way, Black gives White scope to play on both sides...]
;W[jr];B[kq];W[jq]
(;B[bj]C[ff - Mistake in direction. Black tries to be severe but just forces White to wander through Black's position and take advantage of White's superior fighting power. White is able to take advantage of Black's loose play at H8. B10 is pretty much a wasted play]
;W[gk]C[Still, I think white is in trouble... in the game I wasn't feeling worried but looking back I think this looks bad for white...]
(;B[jm];W[kp]
(;B[lp]C[ff - A weak response that lets White off the hook. See the variation...]
;W[lo];B[mp];W[kn]C[I think this is an excellent result for white... keepling black weak while moving out... I don't know whether white should have gotten something this good?

ff - Definitely not. In this game Black did not have enough skill to punish White's earlier mistake. White should not be happy with the result up to here. He just got lucky! :-)]
(;B[nm]C[ff - This is poor timing. Black is running now with no threat to invade White's weak extension on the right.]
;W[ll]C[ff - So White is able to break out with weak Black stones on either side. White demonstrates why this is a handicap game. ;-)]
;B[jk];W[qr]C[I think this works well in the game, but maybe black should play E10 first, try to end in sente and then come back to this corner? I played R2 because I don't think black is fully alive and it would help with the fight in the center if I could threaten this corner group a little]
(;B[pq]C[ff - A bad play that simply forces White to do what White wants to do anyway.]
;W[op]
(;B[on]C[ff - A terribly sad play for Black, "forcing" White to protect against the invasion on the right. This also does not fix Black's shape problems as White proceeds to demonstrate.]
;W[pm];B[nk];W[mn];B[oo];W[lj]
(;B[hk]C[In the game I thought this result was reasonable because E10 might be from the wrong direction? still, this makes white's situation easy.

(;W[ns]
(;B[os];W[ls];B[ks]
(;W[js];B[ms];W[gl]C[I played this move because I wasn't certain that the black group in the lower right could die, so I thought this was a 'safe' ko threat - it didn't cost points and it hurt the black group in the center, I didn't expect black to take the ko...

ff - You were correct to wonder about the ko. It is very difficult for White to "win" it. It is not difficult for White to make seki, but actually killing Black is much harder.]
(;B[nr];W[hm];B[in];W[gm];B[jo];W[io];B[jn]
(;W[ko]C[ff - Why protect this cut? Since White is already out at the top and Black is already alive in the bottom right, it means nothing.]

(;W[kg]C[I think this move was also a mistake...]
(;B[jg]C[but this move doesn't punish white];W[ie]C[ff - I have to say that around here I lost my head and analyzed the situation for some hours. :-) White's last few plays have left the top with some defects and Black pretty much alive in the center. Meanwhile there are the six Black stones in the lower center hanging around plus many large yose points. So how much damage can Black do at the top and how should White resist? How much is sente worth? Honestly, I could not come to a clear conclusion, the situation was too complex for me.]
(;B[kh]C[ff - This play assures Black of two eyes in the center. However, Black lets White off easily here as well. See the variations...]
;W[ke]C[ff - This looks like a mistake in direction. Black is alive after L12, so this is not sente. Luckily for White, in the game Black goes back and connects at H6. However, what would White have done if Black had moved into the top? During the review I became quite obsessed with this position and tried various things for hours without coming to a clear conclusion! :-) See the variations, which are really just stubs - the solution to the problem is left as an exercise for the student! ;-)]
