C[This is a close game, where both players missed several opportunities to take the lead.

Here are some 2 pieces of advice that both players should keep in mind for the future :   1) before playing a big move (a move wich aims at territory control), check you don't have to play an urgent move (a move that settle a group).Ugrgent moves are more important that territory moves .
In this game, both players miss a vital point for 20 moves...

2) When you want to attack a group , play far from the stones. Contact moves are for defensive purpose.]

;B[qn];W[qo]LB[pj:a][nq:b][mq:c]C[R5 is joseki only when white has a stone around A.

In this situation, white usual's response are B or C.];B[pn]
;W[np];B[pj];W[nc];B[kd]
(;W[qf];B[nd]C[I think black at P15 would have been slighty better, as black can wait a while before deciding  wich side he wants to keep.
R17 is also an option, and lead to a difficult fight for white.
That's why it would have been safer for white just to play O15 instead of  R14. See variation]
;W[md];B[ne];W[me]
(;B[nf]C[Black at N14 looks better. see variation.];W[qc]C[White should have played p17. R17 let black cut at p17 and take the 3 white stones.
If white wanted to play R17, he shouldn't play the exchange N15,O14 before.]

(;B[qd]C[This is the wrong cut side.
Even without the exchange N15-O14, R16 is considered to be slight inferior than P17, and is better suit for handicap games.
With the exchange N15-O14, it's far better to separate at P17.
See variation for further explanations.];W[re]C[White far better at q17.
White cannot hope to save both group of stones. Play this way only give black an easy game.
White will have to crawl to settle the 2 groups.];B[rd];W[qi]
;B[qj];W[ri];B[oc]C[Good.];W[nb]C[It's no use for white to try to save both groups. This will give black an easy game.]
;B[ob];W[mf];B[mc]TR[kd]C[This is not a good idea.
1) White can sacrifice his two stones . This will weaken the black marked stone.   2)Black corner group is allready alive. No need to capture these 2 stones.

Maybe a hane at N13 would habe been better.];W[lc];B[mb];W[lb]
;B[na];W[ld]TR[kd]C[The marked stone is weakened. Black cannot hope a sever attack on m16 group now.]

(;B[mg]C[maybe black should  play directly at A . this will force white to run his R14 group in the center, and can help black to prepare an attck on M16 group. See variation.]
;W[lg];B[mh];W[hd];B[fc]LB[rg:a]C[Black F17 secure the black marked stone, but doen't put enough pressure on white M16 group.

Probalby black should attack white R14 group at this moment with A for example.]
;W[gb]LB[rg:a]C[G18 look a bit strange to me.
I think white should better play at A, as black can ignore G18.]
;B[ch]LB[ci:a][cm:b][rg:c]C[i don't like this move because :   1) it doesn't secure black corner, white can still invade at C17.

2) i don't see any good follow-up on the lower part of the left side.A move at A would have create probably more possibilities for black  ( an invasion at b for example).

(;B[jf]TR[kg][lh]LB[kh:a][jg:b][mm:c][lp:d]C[1) The exchange M12,L13 strengthen white. Black shouldn't play M12 if he want to move L16 stone

2) I'm not sure it's a good idea to start something on the upper side. maybe black could have try something on the lower side of the board. the lower right white group is not settled yet.
Maybe black could have played A first, wich induces a white answer at B, then turn back to D,See variation]

[kg][lg]LB[il:a][jk:b][gj:c]C[This is a turning point.
Black cannot separate the marked stone from  J10.
Black J11 is a contact move wich strengthen white.
When you want to attack , don't play contact moves.
Contact moves are defensive.
Though it's hard to find a good attack move in this situation.
Black should play a move wich threaten the marked stone and aim at N4 group too...
Maybe something around A, B or C];W[hi];B[ji];W[gj]C[White is virtually connected to c9...]

(;B[kj]C[The cut at a is a must. Black should play it , becasue white has no choice : he must answer at G11.

;W[ql];B[qk];W[rn]C[This is a difficult situation for black , because now white can enclose the corner at P2 and get 10-15 points. Furthermore, this will stabilize N4 group.]

White can only escape in the center with A. As it gives white a bad shape, one can conclude the hane at N14 is a strong move.
