C[Hi,

This a game from the preliminary round of the IGS Amateur Go Tournament.  I played black.  I don't know what my opponent's rank is, but it is definitely much stronger than me.  I lost some big groups and ended up resigning, but I felt that I never had the time to save the groups and still keep the game remotely even.  I really need some insight on how I got into these situations.

Thank you!];B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[oc]C[[Malweth\]: This move is an indicator of the stronger player.]
;B[dp];W[po]C[[Malweth\]: As is this move... it's just a general feeling.]

(;B[ld]C[[Malweth\]: It's always best to play safely when playing a stronger opponent. It would be hard to fault this move so early in the game, but the safer option might be the variation.
---
The right direction?  I thought about played Q8 as well, but I wanted to seperate white.]
;W[me]C[[Malweth\]: This is uncommon joseki for amateurs. Your opponent is trying to intimidate you!]
;B[od]LB[md:A][pd:B]C[[Malweth\]: A good response... you played much of this sequence well!

(A+B were the correct moves for W).];W[nd]C[[Malweth\]: The bad move for W. Correct moves were marked.]
;B[oe];W[pc];B[qc]C[[Malweth\]: This is the required variation after W's mistake, but (per Ishida's Joseki Dictionary) N15 is now bad because it should be at O15.]
;W[le];B[jd]C[[Malweth\]: But to have followed Joseki this closely, you must have known the sequence already!]
;W[hc]
(;B[ke]C[[Malweth\]: It doesn't look bad, but it certainly isn't severe. B first at N17 is sente. 

---
Was this move a mistake?  I felt that white's group in the top right was weak, but L15 felt heavy after I played it.]
;W[lg]
(;B[kf];W[ng];B[pg];W[kg]
(;B[he];W[ig]C[[Malweth\]: Now B's position is painful.];B[if]
C[Now my group is definitely too heavy.];W[hg]
(;B[gc];W[gb];B[ic];W[gd];B[hd];W[fc]C[[Malweth\]: That was a lot to give up!]
;B[ib]C[[Malweth\]: N17 might have done the same in sente.

---
This move is probably not necessary.];W[qi];B[pl]C[[Malweth\]: This looks like an overplay! Now O4 is probably necessary.]
;W[oi]
(;B[qg]C[[Malweth\]: He has intimidated you. This group still has the corner. 

---
Again, probably not necessary, but I was really scared for my groups.]
;W[np]
(;B[oo]C[[Malweth\]: This seems like a bad idea with the giant W wall above.

The attachments (variations) are joseki.];W[op];B[pp];W[qo]
;B[on];W[rq]C[[Malweth\]: Black is in a bad spot now.];B[nr]
C[[Malweth\]: The problem is that once you cut at P5, you have two groups that both MUST live. White has two groups that probably WILL live (the influence helps W a lot and weakens the P6 group a lot).

---
The right move?  The group ends up in really bad shape, but I'm not sure how to carry out the fight.]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[kq]C[[Malweth\]: This seems to give B an out ... though B is very low afterward.]

(;B[lp]C[[Malweth\]: The peep does seem to weaken B rather than help.]
;W[lq]
(;B[lr]C[The last couple black moves were really bad, in my opinion.  I eventually gave up on this group, but pushing more on the bottom would probably be just as bad.]

(;W[qr];B[pr];W[ro]
(;B[gq]C[I didn't want to push again and give white another third line stone, but is there any way to carry out the fight?  I couldn't find a way to attack white.]
;W[kr]C[[Malweth\]: Now B is dead.];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj];W[mn]

;B[hm]C[I was looking this whole time to play B14 before it was too late, but I couldn't.]
;W[cl]C[[Malweth\]: This certainly seems to lock it up for W... The loss in the LR was very big... and this captures a large territory.]
;B[cf]C[[Malweth\]: Normally yes, the attachment at C17 works. With all this W it becomes harder.

Unreasonable?  Is there a way for this stone to live?];W[ch]

;B[bc];W[ef];B[ee];W[de];B[gf];W[fe];B[fg];W[eg]C[[Malweth\]: TKO... B has 5 distinct groups and two are dead.]

;B[el];W[ek];B[fl];W[fk];B[rm];W[qk]C[[Malweth\]: Reading is #1. Increasing your reading ability can help you see through problems like the LR. Your joseki knowledge is good, but choice could be improved... not everything needs to be pincered.

Perhaps the biggest idea with the fuseki is that it should be equal unless one player makes a mistake. Letting your opponent have some territory without a fight is ok (especially when you're already fighting elsewhere on the board).
---
I resigned here because I'm pretty far behind.  My play seems fine on the single digit kyu level, but I just don't understand how these dans play.  Any insight would be much appreciated.

Thanks again for the review!])
