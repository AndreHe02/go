C[Hi! I'm wjzz and i'm 12k kgs. i playrd this game as black and i lost. I would be grateful if u showed me my biggest mistakes and bad ideas. Thanks in advance for your time!

I will do it at my best.];B[qd];W[ep];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[cq]
C[i have seen this shimari for the first time ... :-|

Very playable.];B[cj];W[cl]
(;B[cg]C[would c14 be better?


C13 is good, See variation for C14.
C14 gives White a move at B12.];W[fc]
(;B[jc]LB[pk:A]TR[oc][qd]C[
K17  does not extend in the best direction from the shimari delta (triangled stones).

Best extension point is around A : extension from the shimari and from Q3.

See vars for other ideas.];W[cf]C[
Not so good move by White. C15 is much better for White.]
(;B[df]C[
Better to play nobi D13, see var.];W[ce]
(;B[bg]C[
D13 better, see var.

This kind of move aims at destroying an opponent base (attacking purpose), at the cost of a cut at D13.

However, the White stones are solid and the Black group  not so solid.  W can confidenrlly cut...]
;W[dh]C[
Not good, W should cut.....]

;W[ak];B[bl];W[bm];B[bi];W[ck];B[aj];W[dg];B[ei]C[
As your group; is alive, you can play E14.

But E11 seems good.];W[ef];B[ej];W[el];B[cm]LB[pk:D][qk:C][po:B]
[qo:A]C[

Your group is alive, and rock-solid toward the center.

Instead of fighting for small points, you should better take a big point on the board : A, B, C, D,..., which have a much more greater value !]
;W[dm];B[cn];W[dn];B[bn];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[do];W[cp]C[
In the process, you made just a few points, and White has started to make a nice influence toward the center and the side.

This exchange is in White favor !];B[em];W[en];B[fm]LB[pk:D]
[qk:C][po:B][qo:A]TR[em]C[
This is a big mistake. 

The triangled stones have no value. Extricating a single stone is OK when it's a cutting stone cutting weak groups, when it's frightening the opponent, when it's threatening to kill,...

You can see that these two stones are worthless. 

This is very important.

A, B, C, D,..., have a much more greater value !!];W[jp];B[po]
LB[pk:B][qm:A]C[
This shimari has a weak point at A, but is strong toward the side.

As White has a solid stone at K4 backed up by strength in the South West corner, you can not expect too much from the side.

Playing around B is also good.

However, Q5 can not be criticized - it's a matter of style.]
;W[qm]
(;B[qn]C[
This move looks to be 100% defensive.

See var.];W[rn];B[ro];W[pn];B[qo];W[rm]

This is a mistake.!

Do not touch what you want to attack ! 

You will strengthen your opponent.

Q10 is maybe better, but it seems difficult to kill White.]

This is not bad for Black.

A move around N3 is very big now.]

You are weakening your corner...];W[op];B[mm];W[nl];B[ln]C[
As a result, tour corner is seriously weakened, and you have now a weak group in White sphere of influence.

Even if you manage to save your stone by connecting it, it's only a few points.

Creating weak groups is usually not a so good idea...
