C[This is my last game, it was not my best game, but in the end I was surprised becous I win by 38 points. Throught the game I try to play correct moves, what should be very hard for me, and in the end I was happy with the result.  Even If I lose a game, if I could play a correct game I will be happy.

Sorry, my english is not very good.



G:
Hi,

I'm not sure I can explain what shyghost meant, but I'll try to point out your really big mistakes! 
It's hard to review games for the winner, because you can always point out that "yes, it might be bad, but I won, no?" - but this attitude will never let you improve. Many times in this game white is very nice and does exactly what you want him to do, in a game against a slightly stronger opponent the same moves would be disastrous!

When there are other comments on a move I will prefix my comments with G!

There is a also a summary and conclusion at the end!

Enjoy!];B[pq];W[dd];B[cp]C[N9DP [18k\]: hi gg

C[Here I just want to play A, B or C, but I was afraid of  B or C becous I do't know how attack this R16. Maybe D or E are better in the case of R16. After all I decided play A.


G: I think B or C are playing to exactly what white wants, (see variation) 

I would play p16 here, but there is probably no real reason to prefer it over E... 

D is too far away, see varation.]
(;B[cf];W[gd]LB[cc:C][ef:B][ci:A][dj:D]C[Well, I always have lots of doubts...Here I think in three moves: A, B or C. Sometimes I would play C to get corner. I don't know if B is a possible move, and after all I play A becous I think it's the more basic move. D is also playable right?

G: 

I think your follow up move is ok, although I would have placed it one line higher.

Since white played 2 spaces away and not a knights-move (f17 - which is more common) C is also ok.]

(;B[ci];W[po]
(;B[qp]C[Is this move good here or there are better ones?

G: I dont like - there are 100s of josekis starting here, see many other options :) 

Although, as white played it here, this is maybe ok.];W[qo]
;B[mq]
(;W[ql];B[nc]C[Now I try to attack R16...

G: yes, this is fine.];W[kc]LB[qc:A][ne:B]C[Here I think in two moves:
A: get corner
B: Run away, so after that try get corner if possible.

At the moment I have lower right corner, have a stone in lower left corner, if I get right upper corner and finish low left corner, I will have three corners! So I decided get corner now!

Grab a big point somewhere else instead! (See variations)]

;B[le]C[I don't know if it is a good move, I just want to be not behind enemy lines, am I right?

G: Locally this is almost ok, but the bottom remains massive... and this is unimportant since your corner group is alive as it stands.]
;W[ni]C[this is also completely wrong - it makes white's already secure area slightly bigger.]

G: Yes, but the bottom corner is more unfinished :)]

;B[bm];W[bl];B[ej]C[It seems not a good move...maybe D7 is better..I don't know...well, at the moment I thought E10 makes pressure on c8 group and run away to the centre...not so good, but I really think is a bad move, is it?

G: I think it's ok - makes life very hard for white group... Alternatively you could take territory at j4]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[cj];B[dj];W[dm];B[dn]C[After this sequence, the result not seems so bad for me...I have territory, and white are under pressure of my stones, he can run to the center, but he will just live, no territory and no points for white group...am I right?


G: Yes.];W[fm]
(;B[jq]C[Can I ignore him? Can I let him run and get some points in down side?

G: Count and see! You only have to count in 25 point chunks to see that you are well ahead!

instead of following blindly white should look for moves that are bigger than the follow up moves you threaten, and play there first. For example, see variations on next move.]

This is end, B win by 38,5.
How am I, am I playing good?

G: 

I am not quite sure what made you submit exactly this game for review. You won and had no particular trouble in doing so. 

You play many moves that only threaten small follow up moves, but in this game you were lucky and white always replied. On the board, always look for the biggest moves first, these are very often in the open areas of the board. 

If you play more stronger players you will quickly see which of your "weak sente" moves go unanswered and learn to take the big points first!

As to shyghost's "basic principles of go" i might recommend you that you read the "second book of go", which helped me a lot when I was your level. 

Finally, keeping playing and enjoy it!
