C[I am 12k on KGS and I play White in this game.

I won the game, but I think Black had the lead during the second half and Black would have won if it weren't for one or two mistakes at the end. I would like to learn how I could have fought harder for territory. Even though I won the early fights, Black was able to build strong moyos on the top and bottom and compete in spite of losing a bunch of stones on the right.

[J\] Hi, my name is Jamie, I'll be reviewing your game.

I noticed (and have noted further on) that you became overconcentrated on the right hand side early in the game. Black gained a slight advantage from this early and held this through to the error that led to black resigning, however there were opportunities for you along the way.

My feeling is that you need to play a little more expansively early on. Don't aim to take little pieces of territory immediately, play larger and welcome black invasions as an opportunity to attack and profit elsewhere.]

(;W[ql]LB[qj:a]C[[J\] An ideal place to play a little more ambitiously. A would be a more dual purpose move, being a good extension from both white corners. A black invasion becomes an opportunity to build a wall up into the centre while chasing.]
;B[qf]
(;W[qh]LB[qj:a][nc:b]C[[J\] Now it is obvious R8 should have been at A, then instead of R14 you'd have played the better response at B without much thought. B is still better even now I think.]
;B[qc];W[qd];B[rc];W[rd];B[oc]
(;W[pf]TR[qh][ql]C[[J\] Now you are overconcentrated on the right hand side. Black has spread around nicely and can now play a big move (not the one black actually played though). Something a little more ambitious would be good, try to make the marked stones do a little more work.]
;B[od];W[oe];B[qj]
(;W[rj]LB[qi:A][qk:B]TR[de][ci]C[I made this move because I read commentary about the same move in another game. But I don't think it makes sense in this game. I think Black could have found a better outcome if he had taken A or B at some point, possibly later in the game. (See variation. Am I missing something?)

[J\] A or B are both bad for black (at the moment anyway) as it creates a hane at the head of two stones, good for white.

I don't much like R10 for black either. Not really any room to develop.]
;B[kd]C[[J\] Black plays big first ... white is overconcentrated on the right.]
;W[ce];B[fd]LB[kd:a]C[[J\] Black would have to be happy with how this works with A.]

;B[ae];W[af];B[bc]
(;W[cl]LB[dg:a]C[[J\] Black responded passively to this so may be it worked ok, however just using the thickness at A to take territory is not good use of thickness. See variation.]

(;B[lh]LB[ni:A]C[I was relieved when Black made this move. I thought I could win the fight if he moved at A, but I wasn't completely sure. I wonder: should I be able to read this out with ease? When I read it out in my head, I was only 95% certain that I would win the fight. It's a simple sequence, but I was afraid I was missing a hidden atari. (See variation.)

[J\] I think you read it ok. Black is better to take this and move on anyway.]
