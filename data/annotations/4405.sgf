RE[W+4.5]

C[Reviewed 14 July 2005 by Allan Wickberg. I am somewhere in the range of 15k. Comments marked "al>".]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[qf]C[W Knight's approach R14. Wasn't sure if I should have ignored it for now but I decided to respond.]
;B[qg]C[The idea here was to drive my opponent towards Q16.

al> Contact play is not so good for attacking - at least if you are looking for a kill - it is more useful for defense, since it strengthens both players (unless, of course, one gets killed). So R12 would have been better as a way of putting pressure on the white stone.

al> On the other hand, the corner stone needs more support than the Q10 stone, so in any case I feel it had been better to add a stone at the top  instead. O16, O17, R16, or even R15 are options if you want the top right corner.

al> On the third hand, the opening you have chosen if designed to gain influence, rather than initially securing territory, so K16 is more consistent, in that perspective. Q13 is also an option for gaining influence towards the center and pressuring white at the same time.]
;W[of];B[qe]C[al> If white would play S14 at this point,he could pry behind black's lines both upwards and downwards along the right side. A better choice for black would be to chase the running white group while outlining territory, like by playing B O16.]
;W[pg];B[rf]C[I took this on the assumption that if W-S13, I could extend B-R12.]
;W[pf];B[rg];W[pe];B[qd]C[Felt my position was too weak with 3 groups.

al> Solid connections are good, since you don't have to go back and patch things up later. So far it looks OK. White is strong towards the center, and black is strong towards the top right corner and along the right side.]
;W[gc];B[kd]C[al> I feel that black is stretching a little too far here. Now white may use his thickness to split the black stones.]
;W[md];B[nf]C[The idea was to divide the two W groups. Perhaps I should have tried B-O15?

al> This does not split white. It also aids white in that he is able to extend while attackning the black stone.]
;W[ne];B[mf];W[ld];B[ke]C[Hoping to wall-off W expansion and then later attack the group along row 17.

al> Black P16 first would be forcing, and still give time for L15.]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jd]C[al> B K16 is not necessary right - white cannot cut because of the ladder (W K16, B J16, W K15, B K14, and so on). B O17 seems more important.

al> I think that black should not try to kill the white group - it seems too hard since white has three options: run out at P12, connect to the other white stones by J18, or make life along the top. 

al> Black probably gains most from driving white to connect to the left, while making profit in the corner and building a wall towards the center at the same time.]
;W[oc]C[I was thinking that I should build my right stones into a living group. But I was also looking to split W's groups apart.]
;B[nd]C[A weak move but this position was to W's advantage and I wanted to deny it to him.

al> Black P16 first. With B O16, black is just helping white to make eyes. After B P16 and white P15, black O17 will push white to connect to the left while black is making a large corner and still have time to connect the N14 and L15 groups by M14 or M15.]
;W[od]C[Swell, O16 could be as good as dead.

al> Indeed, it is. Damage repair may include Q18, to secure territory in the UR corner, M15 to connect the L15 and N14 groups so white won't be able to cut, or O12 to stop white from destroying your potential moyo in the center.]
;B[me]C[Might as well finish my wall while I give him O16.]
;W[oe];B[le]C[Again, trying to just wall W into the top of the board.

al> Black has a good wall and it may be used to assist black stones played along the left side and bottom of the board and perhaps build a moyo in the center. However, gaining territory in the center is very hard, mostly.]
;W[nc]C[al> W O17 is not necessary and gives black the initiative]
;B[re]C[In hindsight, there might have been a more efficient way to make eyes and maybe I could have just played B-T15.

al> White cannot cut at S15 or R12. Black does not need to make eyes so this move just hands sente over to white again. I think a black move around D10 would look interesting, considering the black wall.

al> I am not sure, but O12 might be necessary to apply first, to put a cap on the white P14 group. However, I suspect that it may not be a necessity, and that it is more urgent to play around D10.

al> It would be interesting to hear a stronger player's take on this situation. It takes some skill to make good use of a wall.]
;W[pb]C[al> I think there are bigger points  elsewhere - white should also have an interest to play around D10.]
;B[ka]C[Threatening encroachment.

al> The L19 stone has no future. The white group has life so there is no gain in trying to threaten it.]
;W[la];B[ja];W[lb]C[al> W K18 would eventually kill the black L19 group, so white is being nice here.]
;B[jb]C[al> I still think that black could afford to lose the two stones on line 19, but locally this move makes it interesting to play something like F18 - later - since it undercuts the white G17 stone.

al> However, due to blacks influence in the center, B F16 probably would be more in line with the big picture. Anyway, that is also for later - D10 is the most important play right now, I think.]
;W[qb]C[al> If white want to go for points in the corner, S17 would be bigger.]
;B[qc]C[al> S17 would also make more points for black. Now, white can still play S17 and push black back.

al> But - there are a lot of bigger points on the board. I thnik it would be interesting to see what black could do with that fantastic wall that white has so gratiously given him.]
;W[ph];B[oh]C[I felt I already have a blocking stone in Q10 so building to the left made more sense.

al> Yes, but contact play is not good for blocking. It is too easy for the opponent to sneak out by attacking if you play too close. O12 would work better for blocking the white group's access to the center.

al> However (there is always an 'however' :) a play around D10 would feel better to do first - white  cannot jump to far out in the center without risking getting cut, so I think there is time to play the opposite side before blocking.]
;W[pi];B[og]C[al> This is going in the wrong direction - white can now break out into the center by P11. If black plays P11 instead of P13 here, white P10 woud be cut by B Q9. If white answers with P13, B N12 would block him.

al> The black S15 gourp may be theatened by white S17, in which case it has to run south to live.  I case of an attack from the other side, B S17 makes the group live.]
;W[hf];B[if]C[I think I wanted to make sure there's be a path down of which I could extend into the center of the board.

al> "Stay away from thickness" is a good guideline. Playing close to the opponent's wall may be dangerous, and playing too close to one's own wall, destroys the potential territory that can be gained by it.

al> When white approaches the wall, black should counter from the other side, cut white off, and crush him against the wall. So, a black play around G15 would be more correct here instead of J14.]
;W[jp];B[ie]C[al> This move is also counter productive, as it does not use the wall to it's true potential. White was smart playing K4 since it is just opposite the "mouth" of black's poetntial moyo in the center, and also a natural support for the H14 stone, should it have to run southwards.]
;W[gf];B[id]C[al> This move is not necessary, and most of all, it is very small. D10 is the biggset play still open on the board.]
;W[dj]C[al> Now it will be extremely hard for black to gain something from the wall, and white has established a dominance of the rest of the board.]
;B[dl]C[Felt there was enough room to create a living group so an invasion might work. I thought that if I claimed the center star, W would reinforce his stones to the left.

al> That is a reasonable assessment. The L15 group will most likely live (easy to make eyes at O13 and K15 at least) and by the time black has gained 20 pts in the center, white would have made 60 along the left side.

al> There is plenty of room for invasion still, but D8 does not seem to be such a good starting point, since it will induce white to strengthen the grip on the left side.

al> C17, C14, C6, C3 and F3 are logical invasion points. I am not sure how to make most use of the presence of the black wall, but F3 seems to produce a possible attack vector against white's K4 stone. Maybe H3 would be even graver as a threat to K4. I am thinking along the line of B H3, W F3, B H5 to drive white running into the mouth of the black wall. That would also give black a natural reason to reinforce the right while attacking.]
;W[el];B[dk]C[Wanted to make sure that I would have room for two eyes. Maybe B-D07 or B-C06 would have been better.

al> Splitting the white stones may be a good idea, since the group can either go for C6 or run towards the wall to make life, depending on what white plays. Black needs to be bold now, and hopefully find ways to kill at least one of white's groups, since white can make more territory, with fewer stones, than black at this point.]
;W[ek];B[cn]C[Knight's extension to grab space. B-D06 was another alternative.

al> This also attacks the corner. I think a cut at E10 would have been interesting to try. Splitting the opponent's groups may create good possibilities. It is important to not lose focus on the whole board. Trying to make life for every idividual group may gain less points in the end, than risking some sacrifices in exchange for bigger poitns elsewhere.

al> Creating open situations is always a little nerve wrecking, but it gives even more satisfaction if you end up being the one that managed to take advantage of them.]
;W[dn];B[cm];W[cj];B[ck];W[dm];B[bl]C[al> B8 is a mistake, since it creates an open triangle (C9, D9, D8). White can atari with B9, which will cost black an eye. B8 should be B9.]
;W[co];B[bo]C[al> Because of the open triangle, the black group is essentially dead now. Black B9 instead of B5 could save it - if white B6, then B B7 and either captures B6, or makes an eye on the 'A' line.]
;W[bp];B[bn];W[bk];B[bj];W[bi]C[al> Mistake by white - C8 would kill the black group.]
;B[ak];W[ai];B[aj];W[ch];B[ap]C[Again, threatening encroachment to diminish any space for W.

al> This is no big threat to white, as he can strenghten his corner while defending. Black has managed to gain some points on the left side, while destroying a good chunk of white's potetial territory there, but white is has a huge top left corner underway, as well as at the bottom. At the same time, he has become strong towards black's wall.

al> B H4 is what I would try at this point. B H3 would be less of a threat to K4 than before, due to the white wall to the left. Invading the TL corner, while using the black wall to destroy territory from the outside is another option, but it is important to come out of that situation ahead of white to still be able to play at the bottom.]
;W[aq];B[ao]C[Group completed. It might be possible to still gouge out an eye. Perhaps there was a way to have made this group bigger?

al> The group was alive at move #73 (both bigger and more alive than it deserved to be :). Notice how much stronger white's lines have become because of finalizing the situation. Black's objective - destroying territory for white - was accomplished the moment the black group won life, so the additional six moves has only benefitted white.]
;W[bq];B[ih]C[I was tempted to again try forming a living group in the upper left but was worried that W's stones had a lot of influence in that area.

al> Black should play further away from his wall ("stay away from thickness", remember?). Around the center point would be more appropriate, like J10, or J9, maybe.

al> More importantly, there are easier points open, like invading the TL corner. Or potentially more profitable ones, like H4. It is easiest to make points in the corners, then at the sides, and hardest in the center.]
;W[fh];B[qi]C[Trying to limit W's space in the right.

al> Locally, R10 would work better than R11; less vulnerable, and a safer connection to the S15 group as well as a safer reinforcement of the potential territory along the right side.]
;W[no];B[mo]C[Again, the idea of driving my opponent to my stone at Q04.]
;W[mn];B[lo]C[al> This seems like a god idea, as it splits the white groups and works well together with the black corner stone and the wall.]
;W[np];B[nq]C[Didn't know if this was a strong move. I just wanted to be able to eventually connect M05/N05 to Q04.

al> Contact play is prbably not the way to go here. I would play M3 to enforce the split and to threaten K4 so that white has to decide whether to go for attacking the bottom right corner or saving K4 and the territory at the bottom.]
;W[nn];B[lm]C[This was to bridge my stones on Row 05 to the center.

al> It is a good idea, but white can cut with M6. B L6 instead of M7 would work better.]
;W[ln];B[ko];W[jo];B[mp]C[B-L06 was a move I considered but I wanted to make sure that I could create a living group if W is able to cut me off from the corner.

al> N3 is a more solid connection that gives white less opportunities for attack. With N4 black is creating an 'open triangle' shape which is vulnerable since it is inefficient in terms of liberties.]
;W[kn];B[jl]C[Probably should have played B-L04 but I wanted to claim the center.

al> M3 would be better than L4 for protecting the group. L4 accentuates the 'open triangle' weakness.

al> Also, consider M8 as a way of enforcing the center - it is a potential cutting point for white.


al> I am sorry, but there are no more comments beyond this point - unfortunately, I am afraid I ran short of review time.


al> At this point, white has the upper hand - potential huge territories in the upper left corner and to the bottom left, as well as good chances to destry potential territory for black at the right side and in the center. (As it turned out, the game ran fairly even.)]
;W[kp];B[mq];W[im];B[oq];W[km];B[kl]C[B-M08 might have been wiser.]
;W[ik];B[ll];W[jj];B[il]C[Somehow, I started thinking that I should extend INTO W's area by building a row of stones inwards. I was probably trying to exert some influence to control columns F, G or H (upwards and/or downwards). I felt the group had a lot of liberties so this wa a comfortable exercise.]
;W[jm];B[hl];W[hk];B[gl];W[gm];B[kj]C[Wall-off W and eventually link with B-L09. Then I'd form a base.]
;W[ii];B[jh];W[ol]C[After I saw this, I thought I should build my groups along the right and in the center. But first, I wanted to try an invasion in W's territory to the bottom left (it seemed so huge).]
;B[fp];W[fo];B[gp];W[go];B[ip];W[ho];B[hp];W[eq];B[fq];W[ep]
;B[jq];W[kq]C[Was hoping to link to the group of N03 but now it looks like I may have to create two living groups instead.]
;B[io]C[Hoping yet to link the groups, this move was a risk that perhaps W would fail to play W-K06 and I might be able to kill the group of L03.]
;W[jn]C[So much for that idea. Time to make two groups.];B[er]
;W[dr];B[fr];W[po];B[qo]C[I wanted to bridge to Q10 at this point but would find myself cut by W in move 142. Was wondering if I should have played the next five stones differently.]
