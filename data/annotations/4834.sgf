C[Hi!
I'm playing Black here, and will mark my comments with H.

Thanks to the reviewer in advance.


Hi, I'm shmolex.  I will start all my comments with an S.];B[pd]
;W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[mq]
(;B[qm];W[pr];B[oq]TR[lp][mp][nq][pq][qq]C[H: The idea was to get something like a wall.

S: While a good plan, that is inconsistent with R7.  I'll comment on this after the wall.]
;W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mp];W[qq];B[qp]C[H: I was quite happy with this situation. Do you agree?


S: Now look at the r7 stone.  It is way too close to your wall and inefficient.  Look at earlier variation for other ideas.]
;W[fq];B[lq];W[mr];B[lp]C[S: This is too slow at this stage of the game.  Playing where white played next would have been huge for you.]
;W[jd];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[cj];W[be];B[hq];W[cm];B[go]
;W[eo];B[fp];W[ep];B[eq]TR[hp]C[H: I wasn't sure, whether to cut here, or not, but I thought that I could defend around H4, if it went wrong.

S: It shouldn't have worked, but white was nice enough to let you live.]
;W[er];B[dq];W[fr];B[dr];W[gp];B[fo]TR[hp]C[H: I liked the idea of chasing the white group and threaten to take the corner, so I gave up the H3-strategy

S: see variation];W[hp];B[iq];W[gq]C[S: Another great option here is to give up the 2 stones for a wall.]

(;B[dp];W[do];B[cq];W[bp];B[bq];W[aq];B[ar]
(;W[ap]C[S: Big mistake by white, black should be dead here.]
;B[bs];W[ip];B[jp];W[hr];B[ir];W[gs]
(;B[es]TR[fo][go][fp]C[H: Helping the marked group would have been the other possibility, but I didn't like th eidea of white already being alive.

S: I know we all like to kill :)   But the best solution is letting white live small.  If you go for the kill, there isn't any way you will be able to contain white, seeing as how weak the 3 marked stones are.  Once white escapes, the influence of your wall is greatly reduced.  If you let white live, you can seal him in and increase your framework.  See variation]

(;B[co]C[H: Serious misreading here.];W[bo];B[cn];W[dn];B[bn]
;W[em];B[dl];W[dm];B[cl];W[bm];B[ao];W[gn]C[S: Even if you had saved your T-shape group, you can now see that white would have escaped anyway.  Now the black wall's power is greatly reduced.  Even so, it is bigger to play in the upper left.  Remember, always go for corners before securing center territory.]

(;B[lm];W[nc];B[ne];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[od]C[S: You dont have to worry about the cut, and white doesn't have to protect against this.  Better to extend the black wall.]
;W[md];B[me];W[ld]
(;B[mh]C[S: Why not go for more?];W[ff];B[kh];W[dh];B[ch];W[di]
;B[bl]C[H: mistake again. I thought, I could connect two two groups]
;W[am]C[S: You should play the threat at a8 here anyway.  Otherwise...]
