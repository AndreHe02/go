C[Hi,

Although I am new to the game, I have read through Janice Kim's elementary go books. I would really like to know where I went wrong in this game and how I can work on improving.

Thanks.
Matt

Review by Jadoube

A few thoughts to consider,

1) simply reacting to the opponents move leaves you following thier plans

2) Ideally a move should be threatening enough to make your opponent react to you

3) If your positions are alive, or relatively free from immediate danger then its harder for your opponent to play forcing moves against you.

Throughout this game White's positions were weak while black's became stronger. White was often responding to Black moves - which left Black time to make his groups safer before White got around to attacking them]
;B[dp];W[pc];B[qp];W[dd];B[qe]
(;W[nc]C[J: This is nice and safe but rather tame

a) Its establishing territory along the 3rd line, which is OK but White could do better

b) It does not threaten the Black stone in any way. Nor does it threaten much else in Black's position.

This means Black is free to chose where to play next and is thus controlling the pattern of the game.


Ideally you want your opponent to be responding to your moves    Here's not the place to teach all the alternative Joseki. You might want to visit some of the web sites which play through Joseki moves and look at some other ways of responding to this approach move]

(;W[de]C[J: The alternatives might be more usual];B[qh];W[qj]

(;B[dh];W[cj]C[J: White's best move so far. It leaves the Black group with less room and helps settle the stones on the side.]

(;W[jo]C[J: This sort of move is used to reduce a Black framework and ideally to build up outside strength.

Here Black is not fully established yet so I think an invasion might be more suitable]
;B[lp];W[ip];B[fp]
(;W[jh]C[j: The Black group isn't really threatened by this move so Black can ignore it.   The groups on top and the right side are weaker so an attack there is less likely to be ignored.

White might also continue with the strategy of stoping  black getting so much territory on the bottom and push in further. The Black stones on the left are also weak if they are cut off from the rest.]
;B[co];W[ao];B[ap];W[an];B[aq];W[eo];B[ep];W[do];B[bi]
(;W[bj];B[hq];W[iq];B[ig];W[jf]C[j: This is reacting to Black's move. Its not that important to stop Black coming through this gap at the moment.

Far more important to attack the top or side before Black takes a move to defend.]
;B[mb];W[nb];B[le];W[lf];B[kb]MA[jf]C[j: See how Black has made the group at the top secure.]
;W[ld];B[ke];W[kd];B[la];W[be];B[je];W[id];B[jd]
(;W[mc]C[j: Attacking something that seems alive is unlikely to gain much. Defending the 2 stones is not that much either - lose them? Its only 4 points - much more to be gained by playing elsewhere]
;B[rj]C[j: Black defends the group before White gets the attack in.]
;W[rk];B[ri];W[qk];B[rc];W[qb]C[j: Again Black has expanded his weak groups. They are safer and White has been reduced.]

[ed][fe][ge][he][hd][ok][pk][jr]C[j:

A general assessment of the position :

Black's groups are in relatively safe. Nothing looks in imminent threat of dying.

White has groups which might be cut off and killed.

Therefore Black is in a good position to attack white in most areas of the board. But if White simply plays defensively Black will consolidate the clear lead in territory that currently exists

Black has 55 which can be increased
White has 36 which might increase a bit if black does not try to reduce it.

Are there ways Black can increase territory? Yes, a little in the centre, solidifying the bottom and top etc.

There are fewer ways White can increase territory - so White needs to do something to seriously dent black's territory.   Therefore I would look to push firmly into Black's territory and reduce it as much as possible]

(;W[hl]MA[rb][hb][kf][mf]C[j: These stones are well inside Black's influence. They are not going to make eyes, their only hope is to connect somehow to the top right.

Black has so many ways to cut any link to the top corner that this stone is probably committing suicide.

The invasion runs the risk of strengthening Black enough to let Black invade the left side in turn. However Black is not strong in the corner so it should produce a good enough result
