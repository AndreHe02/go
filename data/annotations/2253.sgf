C[ablout fuseki  can you tell me about concept of fuseki and during the game ?
thank you for comment.
and sorry for my bad english.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[qf]

(;W[fq]C[typically one would respond to the kakari in the upper right at r14, but in it not always needed

however, the approach at f3 is the wrong direction, in fuseki, you always have the choice to build your own moyo or destroy the opponents, and given equal choices, it is better to build your own, though if you can do both it is even better

due to this reason an approach at c6 is much easier (see variation)]

C[white played well overall, I think you need to avoid the temptation to invade too much, when building your own moyo is easier. also make sure to watch your weak group, it is far too easy to get caught up in playing tenuki alot, but leaving weak groups behind and costing you.]
