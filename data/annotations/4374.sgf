C[Hi Jason,
I am a 3kyu from the netherlands. Cause my rating isn't that much higher than yours I'll try to keep my comments to something I CAN say. That means I won't go too much in details especially in the middle game. Hope you still have some profit from my comments.
Tobias

Hallo!

I am Black.  I won by resignation, but it was very close.  Truesaint is a good friend of mine.  When we play we usually go all out on each other.  ^^

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for by submitting this game for review.  Perhaps, some general tips, comments, and alternate moves on my go.

I would like to know where I stand, and what I need to do to move up the ladder.

Thank you so very much!

(;W[iq]TR[dd][pq]C[Tobias:  Oops... 
If I would be black in this game I would be happy with this move from white cause I think its the wrong direction of play.
When looking for the right Joseki one has to consider the 2 adjacent sides of the bord (the marked stones). 
The marked black stone at the lower right is on the 3rd line wich means that the bottom edge is less interesting for both sides than the left edge. There the white stone is on the line of development (the 4th line) and both sides should try to get invluence there.
J3 gives this opportunity to black.

See the variation of this move what white could have done better.]

(;B[fo]C[Tobias:  Black is not punishing White for the mistake. Again wrong direction. Still the left edge is the most important area. See the variation]
;W[dn];B[io]C[Applying pressure and playing for influence.

Tobias:  pressure...?  I would say you are pushing white to make a move witch white wants to do anyway :)]
;W[lq]C[Tobias:  This one!]
(;B[lo]CR[ho][jo][ko][mo][np][op]LB[qo:A]C[Tobias: This is way too loose. Gaps everywhere. Bad shape. 
Closing the corner at A to avoid a kakari seems necesarry but still there is a chance to go for the left edge too (see var). Hard to say whats better.]
;W[np]C[Tobias:  White found one of the gaps :)]
(;B[mq]C[Tobias:  Too agressive! This kind of moves should be saved for real emergency situations cause most of the times it strengthen the opponent (like here).]
;W[mp];B[lp];W[mr];B[kq];W[lr];B[kr];W[pp]C[I'm not sure what to do here.  I wanted to play a big move...C8/F17/R14, but I thought that if I could save the corner it would be a big boost early in the game.

Tobias:  The corner has first priority now.]
(;B[oq]C[Tobias:  I wouldn't start here. Hane seems to be the move here (see variation) but actually I can't say this for sure. A dan player might know better.]
;W[nq];B[op];W[oo]
(;B[qp]C[Q5 better?  I didn't want to complicate things.

Tobias:  Q5 simply doesn't work.];W[po];B[qr]LB[qo:A]C[Tobias:  Too early. First pushing at  A is better]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[mo]C[Tobias:  BAD! Dont peep where you can cut!]
;W[no];B[cl]C[Tobias:  GOOD!];W[cm]LB[em:A]C[Tobias:  Bad reaction from white.  A is better]
;B[dl]C[Tobias:  I'll stop my comments here and I hope you liked it. If you want just send me a feedback at tobias87@zonnet.nl.

greetings and good luck in your Go

;W[gq];B[qo]LB[lq:A][fr:B]TR[gp][fq]C[Tobias:  Finally black closes the corner and white cannot even extend to a point like A cos of black B and the bad aji from the 2 marked stones.
The low lying black stone at C6 makes it hard for white to develop the left side.]
))
(;W[cn]C[Tobias:  Simply playing here would be good enough for white cos its the right direction.
If black is not answering it still leave the possibility to do something at the lower edge.]
;B[jp]C[Tobias:  Black sets up the famos Kobayashi Fuseki. Its a fighting fuseki.]
;W[qn]LB[po:A][qp:B]C[Tobias:  White usually approaches a bit from a distance to avoid being attacked in a pincer. Black usually continues with A or B.]

(;W[po]C[Tobias:  If white want to prevent black from playing the Kobayashi Fuseki this is the way. 
Also a very popular opening.]))
