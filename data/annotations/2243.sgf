C[I'm particularly interested on joseki / fuseki.
The pressure was not very high from both players to one another (though one supposedly much stronger than the other). I did add some short variations here and there for reviewer's opinion.

Reviewer: I hope to be useful to you
For any question you can find me on KGS as "Wiles"];B[pd];W[dd]
;B[oq];W[cq];B[qp];W[qk];B[qg];W[qn];B[jp]MA[fp]C[F4 better ?

Reviewer: yes, here you can also play the exchange f4-d5 first, anyway the game move isn't bad]
;W[hq];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[hc]C[this is called for by K16, I assume ...

Reviewer: k16 is ok, but you must be prepared for the h17 invasion, anyway i'm not sure that is good for white to play it immediately]
;B[fe];W[he];B[db]C[Reviewer: This move is aji-keshi, since it erase the possibility of a 3-3 invasion later, and don't give black any eye,as white can play f18 later.
It's better to immediately run out];W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[ch]
;W[dc]C[Reviewer: very bad move for white: aji keshi and bad shape at the same time.]
;B[ec];W[gb]

(;B[pc]TR[fh][fi][dj][ej][fj]C[I thought : slow but big

Reviewer: yes very big, but at this stage of the game there are more important things, the marked stones are not strong. Attacking them wille let B gain more than just some points in the corner

The ladder is less important than capture those 8 stones for black]

(;B[dr];W[ds];B[oj]C[There was probably a more severe play in the corner, but I was considering J5 ladder,
because I thought G4 group not totally 2 eyed

Reviewer: If you are worried about the ladder than take the stone immediately, or play q11 as ladder breaker
tha game move seem useless to me];W[ok];B[jo];W[er];B[eq]C[Reviewer: very little]
;W[hl]C[Reviewer: Finally W has played here, anyway B must continue attack this group]
;B[lc]C[Reviewer: wrong direction.
Black has to attack the W center group
Also because the h12 group is still with only one eye, and a white move around k12 would now be severe]

Reviewer: I really don't understand why W hadn't attacked the black center group]
;B[nf];W[ng];B[nk]C[for sustaining H12

Reviewer: Wrong. If you have a weak group then play moves to make eye-shape or to connect it to another group.
The game move doesn't help your center group, since W can play tenuki and attack it directly]
