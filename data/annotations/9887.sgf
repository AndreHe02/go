C[Hi, my name is Tim Kington, and I'm MatCauthon on OGS and DGS.  I'm 1d AGA, and was 1d last time I played consistently on KGS.

neyric :

Dear commentator,
I am neyric in this game (white), playing a serious game (one hour each) on KGS with a good friend of mine.
I don't use this account to play, so I'm marked 8k but I'm 5k KGS on another account.

I think I made a big mistake in the game (a bad reduction), but I'm eager to find smaller mistakes...

I ask some questions on critical or questionnable moves, but feel free to comment on other moves :)

Thank you !];B[pc];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq]

[pk:C][qk:A]C[neyric:

I didn't really know how to respond to 1 being high (I expected it to be on third line).
I would rather have played A, but 1 being high, I prefered to play high too since R4 is low.

Is it wrong ?

It seems okay to me.];B[oq];W[pq];B[op];W[pn]LB[qn:a]C[I think A would be better.  A would create a better link to the stone above, and you wouldn't have the aji of the cut to worry about later.]

neyric :

I expected a pincer here, to followup with a double kakari approach and take the corner. (which kind of happenned). Is there anything wrong with this strategy ?

Well, you have to do something.  I would probably play A.  it's easy to live at the top, and it's hard for Black to complete the right side.  B and C both leave room for you to invade.]

neyric :
I want to develop the side, protect Q8, and threaten the L3 group.
Is this the good direction of play ?

I hesitated with A....

A might be forcing, so it's possible you could have both.  Since the stones on the right aren't well connected, I might play this one too.]
;B[je]LB[hq:a][bq:b]C[
neyric :
Looks slow to me, not really doing anything... is it ?

It looks a little slow to me too.  I would play A.  After that, B would become annoying.]

neyric:

I'm kind of happy to extend here to threaten L3 more, make this group escape, and reinforce the right-side group.]

I was afraid any hane would lead to a risky fight. I prefered to stay strong. But am I too nice ?

And this isn't risky?  I would play the hane above, to prevent the connection at A.]

I didn't necessarly wanted to seal black in.
I wanted to maintain the two groups well separated, and keep strong in the middle to attack the lower group.]

We discussed this move in our review after the game. Ghislain was surprise by how slow this was, but I wanted to protect the connection with the corner.
Was this unnecessary ?

I think so.];B[en]
(;W[di]C[
neyric :

I think this is a bad move. I wanted to make a reduction, but it now clearly seems too deep. I don't have a good follow up.

I was blinded by B14's aji.

I agree.  It's too deep.  Maybe you should set it up?  You need to use the weak group you created at some point.]

useless ? I think I might have lost the game on this move, if black protected the bottom-right group instead of responding.]

What about this attack ?

I think Black should live.]

black resigns here. I think it was too early considering our level...
Any chance to make the bottom group alive ?

Overall, do you have any advice on what I should work on to improve ?

Thank you again !


In general, I think your play in the center is extremely agressive.  You seem to be playing moves with the intent of killing the groups you're attacking.  Instead, try playing attacking moves that work whether or not you kill the group.  An example would be the suggested variation that creates an invasion/reduction on the left.  You also threw a lot of good stones after bad - when you realize the stones on the left are in trouble, you need to be sure they can get away before you try to bring them out.  If escaping fails, you should really lose the game because of the extra territory Black gets from the attempt.]
