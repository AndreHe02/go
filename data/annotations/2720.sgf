RE[B+4.50]
RU[Japanese]

;B[cp]C[Frs:
I (16 kyu) played White in this game against jwe3 (17 kyu).

The result is pretty close: B+4.5 with a komi of 0.5.

Intersections marked with triangles are alternative moves for White, I considered too, which imply my questions.

In particular I am interested in White's biggest mistakes during the first 65 moves.

Thank you in advance for your review. :-)];W[pp];B[qd];W[dc]
;B[oc]LB[cp:A]TR[eq][fq][gq][hq][iq][jq]C[R> B has made a shimari in the top right. W has sente.

If you're going to approach the stone marked 'A', then it is usually better to approach from the direction it is weakest and that's on the side where it is furthest from the edge. Marked points.

Alternatively you could make a gote move like making a shimari in the top left, but then B has sente]
;W[dk]C[R> This is an extension from the D17 stone, but a bit of a long one and can easily be invaded. The down side is that it isn't sente so your opponent can take this oportunity to attack]
;B[qn]C[R> This is a good approach against a stone on the 4th line. The Q4 stone is now weak, and it is probably best to answer this therefore B keeps sente with this move]

(;W[nq]CR[np]C[R> Good answer. O4 leaves a weakness that can be eploited later.]
;B[eq]CR[qk][rp]C[R> Not an urgent move for B, the two marked moves are more urgent. The R6 stone is vunerable to a pincer]

(;W[jd]TR[lc][de][df][pi][jj][ql][cn][dn][hq]CR[jc][qk][jq]
C[frs:
I played K16 because the biggest "empty" distance on the 3rd and 4th line was between D17-P17.

What are good alternatives for White K16 ?

R> The Pincer at R8/R9 looks good. 

Bear in mind that B's shimari at the top is facing down, so B doesn't have much interest in playing along the top right now.
The bottom looks like a fair bet too, though H3 is a bit close to E3 and too far from o3. K3 should giev you the lions share of 
the bottom.

At the top K17 is better becasue it cannot be approached from M17.

C6 is better than D6,  but you'll have difficulty holding on to the top left (D9 is too far from D17).]
;B[kq]CR[ql][iq]C[R> L3 is too far, you can now attack L3 or R6]

(;W[pi]TR[ql][hp][hq]CR[qi][iq]C[R> J3 or R8 look like good moves, but R11 looks good too (better than Q11 - see variation)]
;B[qk]TR[pg][ri][ok][mp]SQ[lc][cm][rp]C[R> W has managed to stabilise his stone at R6, it's going to be a tough fight for W on the right. 

OK, big points left now are marked, the ones marked with a square are black's sente.]
;W[qg]C[R> Q11/ R13 are just becoming a weak group at the moment - this could cause trouble later on in the game.

R13 is necessary though you were right to play it in the circumstances (but Q11 was a mistake).]
;B[lc]C[R> B takes one big point in sente]
(;W[gc]TR[jc][kc][gd][hp][hq]CR[de]C[frs: Trying to improve the security of the D17 corner, too.

R> D15 looks like it will stabilise the corner and re-inforce K16, but K16 was too high to start with - this is emphasised by the fact that you think that K17 is one way of responding to M17.

Playing K16 just allowed B to extend to M17 and keep sente.]
;B[cm]C[R> B gets to take 2 big points

again against a stone on the 4th line]
(;W[ci]TR[df][ck][fk][cl]CR[dh]C[frs: White C11 to prevent a move like Black D12.

R> Not on a big enough scale ... see variation (C8)

if you play F9 immediately, B can reduce your territory on the left, with B10]

(;B[hp]C[R> Good move by B, now the attacks on R6 and L3 have gone

B could also have played S4 in sente first before coming back to H4.

H4 isn't threatening anything, so is a gote move, and W get's sente.]

(;W[cf]TR[df][hn]CR[le][ok][em]C[R> D14 looks better than C14, H6 looks like you're making a weak group.

But C14 is a gote move (doesn't demand a response)

E7, P9 or M15 are all possible, and are bigger threats that C14 (which isn't a threat).]
;B[on]C[R> Again B get's sente and makes a threat (to enclose and kill the bottom right corner).]
;W[qp]TR[qo]C[R> S4 is best here - close the corner. 

You should see that B forced you to make this move.];B[le]C[R> So B can get anoter big point.]
;W[ii]TR[jf][lg][ng]CR[cl]C[frs: White J11 too early ?

R> Can still kick at C8 followed by D7, G9 first, or K14 looks good, though is likely to drive B to surround Q11,R13

NB: C8 is threatening something, so is better than being a submissive mvoe.]
;B[lh];W[nf];B[jf];W[ie];B[if];W[hf]CR[ri]C[R> Vital point at S11, B should play here first to rob W of his base, really those W stones deserve to die.]
;B[oj];W[qj];B[pj];W[rj]TR[fl][hl][il][mo][lq]CR[kj][lj][cl]
C[R> Well you got away with it ;-)

I like C8 as an initial kick, though F8 through J8 look good.  M3 is a bit dubious, and other options L/M10 are also worth thinking about.]

(;B[rk];W[rh]C[R> Good response];B[lo]C[R> :-) B has made a gote move.]

R> Regarding you're request to concentrate on the first 65 moves.
My main comment is that you're not ceasing the initiative often enough.

When you have sente you need to make the most of it.

Look at the first 37 moves of the game and see where you made
submissive moves, then see where they correspond to you playing
an earlier move on the 4th line (move 135).

Also you might want to learn that little manoeuvre around B5 in the endgame ;-).]
