GTL COMMENT:

An imposter submitted this game looking like it was played between two amateur 2dan players. Our reviewer "north" reviewed the game under the impression that this was a game between amateurs.
Afterwards, we were alerted by someone else that this was actually a game between Choi and Lee, two 9dan professionals. The game was played in the first round of the Fujitsu Cup.

Instead of removing the game from our archive, we agreed with "north" on keeping the review public. We think it is an interesting review. It does show how thinking of strong amateur dan players like "north" differs from professionals.

Please keep this in mind, when reading the comments on this game.

ps: it goes without saying that submitting such games is against the GTL rules and netiquette in general. We do not take lightly being the target of such misguided jokes.
============================================



I played black in this game and lost by 2.5 points to white, please point out any alternate moves to mines in certain situations, maybe i miscalculated in some spots. thanks.]

this is a pretty close game, i thought by killing the bottom white group i would be able to match white in territory, but no....
please give me some advice in regenerating the life to the upper black group, maybe that's where i lost my advantage, thanks again.



Overall, both White and and Black played very well in this game.

There are two big mistakes that Black made in this game and should avoid in the future. One is B[H14\], That causes the upper black group hard to live and also the white group at the right lower side easy to live. The second mistake is B[K5\]. If Black played correctly in these two places. High chances are that black would win this game.]
