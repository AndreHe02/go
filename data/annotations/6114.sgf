C[My name is Tim (Talaer on KGS) and I'll be reviewing this game for you. If you have any more questions for me or wanted to play, feel free to find me on KGS or send me an email. I  will answer any questions in this game the best that I can and try to find 'better' moves whenever they stick out at me. However, I am only a kyu myself, so my moves may also not be very good. :)

;W[cm];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp]
(;W[er]C[I use http://tin.nu/eidogo when referencing joseki. It shows that this move is the 'old' style but still playable. B also responded out of joseki with his next move. I'll put in some variations.]

(;B[fo];W[cj];B[op];W[ed]C[I probably would have responded in the bottom right instead of playing here. A pincer move at the bottom could try to serve as a splitting move between two black groups, whereas C16 could act as a splitting stone between two of yours now.]
;B[cg];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[hd];B[jc];W[hc];B[mc];W[hq]
C[I believe this can be safely one move higher. Either way, this is the right idea.]
;B[fp]C[Bad for B because he is actually not threatening to cut you with this move.]
;W[kq];B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[mq]C[B has to make a tight extension.]

(;W[or]C[I think it is important now to either strengthen the lower right, or the left side.]
;B[oq];W[rd];B[qc];W[qf]C[This has become a very "small" game. It is hard for either player to find a large area for development. It will likely be decided by small amounts of points gained or lost in fighting.]
;B[gr];W[gq];B[fr];W[fq]C[B helps W with these moves.];B[qm]
C[This is a good idea for B but I think it should be one space lower. Here you can (and should) easily divide it off at Q6.]

(;W[em]C[This move is not bad.];B[dn]
(;W[dm];B[bn];W[bm];B[br];W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qn];W[po];B[qo]
;W[pp];B[qi]C[B forces bad shape on your stones while making his stones stronger.]

;W[qr];B[pr]
(;W[ml]C[B got to unite his stones and make a few points. I'm not sure that this move is very threatening. It seems like the upper right has become the "hot" area that needs attention the most.]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[kn];W[hn];B[io];W[in];B[jo];W[ho]C[Very good. It is nice to not be pushed around so easily. :)]
;B[of]C[Developing while attacking, this is bound to be painful.]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[sb];B[qb];W[rh];B[ri];W[qh]C[My moves exactly. ;)]
;B[ph];W[sf];B[jf]C[B gains some decent points here and reduces your center influence moderately.]
;W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[jd];W[ok];B[pk];W[ka];B[lb];W[ja]C[Why?]
;B[ic]C[Luckily B responds with something equally gote.];W[dh]
;B[la];W[jh]C[This does feel like it is worth more than the ~12-14 points you'd lose up top. B should be able to moderately reduce this area, though. With W leading well ahead in points, that can be his only choice.]

;W[mr];B[lr];W[ls];B[jr]C[This result seems to have been too good for B. See the variations entered previously.]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[bo];B[co];W[bp];B[cs];W[dr];B[bq];W[an]C[Obviously an excellent result for W. No way to lose at this point. :)]

;B[oj];W[nj];B[mk];W[lk];B[ol];W[mj];B[ok];W[lm]C[This seems to be a gote move, but B replies again. The game is pretty much settled at this stage, so I will leave my final comments at the end.]

[ns]C[This is a hard game to review being that you won by such a large margin. I tried to find various places in the game where I might have done things a little differently. If you have any specific questions about the game, please feel free to send them to me or find me online. 

The biggest thing that hurt you in this game was losing the group along the bottom. Solving life/death or tesuji problems will aid in finding the right moves in situations like that one. 

Other than that, there were a couple of gote moves that were made by mistake, even though the opponent responded. Try to look at each move you make to see whether or not the opponent actually -has- to respond.

Thanks,
Tim (Talaer on KGS)])
