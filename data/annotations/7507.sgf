C[[REVIEW GTL - bkgo 11k vs. lorill 11k.sgf\]

[krinid\] I've made a lot of comments.  This is definitely a case of a big mistake causing a loss in an otherwise won game.  Let me know if you have any questions regarding what I've said or the variations.

Hi dear reviewer,

I've been playing for three monthes and was quite happy with this game, until I lost by resignation ;)

I have two main questions :
* how could I have survived the invasion at move 86 ?
* I think I was ahead before this invasion, is it true, or am I making a judgement error ?

Beside this main points, there are probably a lots of mistakes, so feel free to point them out.

Thanks !]FG[259:]PM[2];B[pd];W[cq];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[dk];B[jp]
C[not so sure about this one, maybe K3 would be better ?


[krinid\] I like K4 as it's higher and has more influence and potential for territory.  K3 is safer, lower and more realized territory influence albeit less than K4.]

;W[ce];B[gc];W[eh];B[gh]C[[krinid\] Wow, this looks like you're trying to take 75% of the board.  This is an overplay.  There's still too much empty space to be playing a move like this.  This is a center board play, and it's too soon for this.  Develop your corners and sides first with moves like S13 or Q12 or Q13, R6 or Q6, N5, N15, etc.]

(;B[gd]C[[krinid\] Why G16 and not F15?  (see variation)];W[fe]
;B[ge]
(;W[ff];B[gf];W[fg];B[gg]C[[krinid\] This exchange is very good for black.  White should not play this.  White gains a bit in the D14 area, but black gains much more in influence with that huge wall in the center.  But don't be fooled... this is not good playing
 by black, but rather poor playing by white and black taking advantage of it.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[Here i think that R16 would have been better, to build influence toward R9.]

;W[rg];B[rh];W[sg];B[qh];W[mc];B[md];W[gj];B[hj]C[[krinid\] This coming sequence is a TERRIBLE attempt at an invasion for white.  The result is very little redution and a HUGE wall for black.  This is a game losing mistake.  The game was already lost, and this mistake sealed any chance of a comeback (except for a big mistake on black's part, which did in fact happen).

See the variations for some alternatives.]

(;B[oq]C[oops. O3 instead ? But then i fear that these two white stones can survive in my area...


[krinid\] O3 is much better.  Those 2 stones have no hope of living in your territory.  It's completely surrounded by black stones.

But P3 can also work - see the variations.];W[nq]
(;B[np];W[ps];B[oo];W[or];B[po];W[no];B[mp]C[This is the beginning of my misery ;)

[krinid\] Yes, you've lost a lot of points with the death of the Q3 group, but you can still pull out a win as your lead was quite large.  You just need to stop the O5 stone from living - which is really easy, actually.]

[krinid\] No, the variation is actually worse.  I've added moves to the end.  The result is that the black R6 group dies and white has a resounding victory.]

(;B[qm];W[pm]
(;B[ok]C[[krinid\] This is getting too messy.  You need to ensure that the N8 stones don't die.  At best, white has 1 eye right now.  This means you have plenty of leeway to kill it with all the black stones around it.  See the variation.]
;W[ql];B[pj];W[pl];B[rj]C[O10 instead ?];W[ji]C[This is the winning move for White.]
;B[kh];W[nk]C[[krinid\] White dies.  Black is invincible.]
(;B[oj]C[[krinid\] This is the losing move.  You seem to be really afraid of white capturing a stone in the center, but you're missing the point that you can still kill his eyespace.  You lose nothing at all for every stone you lose as long as you kill the white group in the end.  Focus on killing his eyeshape.  See the variations.]
;W[mk]
(;B[ll]C[I knew i wouldn't work, but as the game was already lost, I chose to play it out to be sure.


[krinid\] But you can still salvage the situation if you focus on killing white's eyeshape.  You seem to really fear your stones being captured, but don't worry about it so much - it's the shape that's important.  See the variation.]

Some if it is good solid strategy to build territory, and some of it is a bit of tricky stuff looking for a mistake.  Remember that white is behind, so he has to play some desperate moves, perhaps even some borderline overplays in order to make up the points.

The point here is that black has not completely sealed off the territory, and there is room for white reduction/invasion, leading back to the original comment that trying to take all this territory so early is an overplay and has too many weak points and will typically fail.]
