C[Hi! I am wobo[16k\].
I am playing black and won this game.
Though that don't stop me from doing what I feel a poor fuseki.

The one who reviews this can choose to only comment on the fuseki

Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I've preceded all my comments with my name.

I think the most important thing is to be on the lookout for how to keep one's one stones connected -- and just as importantly, how to keep one's opponents from connecting his stones.  White played passively, and left too many spots where Black could cut and.or play double ataris, and that's why White lost a big group and lost the game handily.

;W[oo]C[Is this really a good move?.. Didn't want to respond to it.. thought his intentsions was to make a fight so he got a good wall and try to make a large territory on the left.. so went for tenuki and played in the last corner before getting to it.

Ted: I don't particularly care for it.  I would have played something more conventional like L4 or K4.]

(;B[rh]C[Ted: I think I'd split the stones by playing at Q12.]
;W[qc];B[pb]C[Ted: This, not your next move, is the mistake; it would have been better to play at Q16 to keep everything connected.]
;W[pd]
(;B[od]C[Felt this was a bad move because of the followup, don't know if I could have made a better response to the next move.

Ted: Here I think I would have preferred O17 to this or your suggestion of P17.]
;W[nb]
(;B[nc]C[Think I was trying to make eye shape while attacking his lonely stone or something like that.

Ted: The empty triangle is bad, as they say.  I'd probably play N17 here.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[lc];B[ld];W[kc];B[ob]C[Ted: This move doesn't do anything for you, other than to make White play something he'd only have to play eventually anyhow.  It's probably better to jump out toward the center now.]

;W[jb];B[kf]C[Ted: This only gets you one point, and doesn't need to be played as long as you can still jump out from K15 and 14.  I'd try something more aggressive like J16.]

;W[ij];B[dj];W[hn]C[Ted: White plays another small move.  Having lost a big group, White needs to do something about where you're trying to get territory.  Attacking someplace like D13 is important.]

Ted: Yes, and it's another example of how passively White played.

The rest of the game needs no further comment.  You're already well in front.]
