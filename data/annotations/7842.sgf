OT[1x20 byo-yomi]
RU[Japanese]

C[Hi, Thanks fore reviewing my game.  I've been in a mega slump when playing evenly.  I've been playing so much handicap Go (Not of my own will, at tournaments and my local club) that I unmistakingly leave weakness in my groups and I tenuki, allowing my opponent to either kill me or make a counter attack.  In this game I felt ahead most of the game because W gave me a huge bottom right corner and he had a running group. this was a moderately quick game with 10 minutes main time and one 20sec byo-yomi period (I didn't know there was SD byo-yomi when I started, but it's already hard getting a game so I try not to quabble over they time they set.  I tried to use all of my time to the max, but I messed up BIG in the endgame and got even further behind.

R: Hi, my name is Philip and I am AGA 4d or 5d. I will mark my comments with R:]

(;B[kd]C[I was aiming at around E16 next

R: There is nothing really wrong with this move, but if white jumps to O15, it erases your moyo pretty effectively. This is contrary to the spirit of the chinese opening. See variation.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kb]C[R: As white, I would be happy with this result.]
;B[ed];W[de];B[ee];W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[fh];W[po];B[qo];W[qn]
;B[qp];W[pn]LB[nn:A]C[R: This is a mistake. White needs to play light here. Something like A.]
;B[nq];W[mo]C[this is where I started to have a bright outlook on the game.  I though: 'I just have to keep up the attack on white and I will win.']
;B[lp];W[ok];B[ng]LB[qi:A]C[I didn't want him to connect  up

R: I think this is a pretty big mistake. A move like A is huge in terms or territory and taking away white's base. The white stones are pretty hard to attack, and this gives white a very obvious next move. O13 has very little value.]
;W[qj];B[pj];W[pk];B[rl]TR[qk];W[qi];B[rn];W[oi]C[R: This is good for white.]
;B[ph];W[pi];B[md]LB[cn:A]C[Was this good timing?

R: Something like A is bigger, but this move is not small.]
;W[nd]
(;B[lo]C[I thought this was a strong move

R: Well, if you are going to play N16, you should finish the sequence up top. Again, this move is not very valuable. White can simply play G3 and you are left with very little on the bottom. Also, if you are still thinking of attacking white in the center, you have to be aware that W can live very easily with moves like R9, or simply just running into the center. See variations.]
;W[ql];B[mn]C[maybe I SHOULD have played H3 or G3, but I expected W to play S 9 and then I could come back to it

R: White should have simply played G3 right away. There is not much danger to his center group.]
;W[gq];B[nj]C[bad on my part cause I forgot about the  S9 I just mentioned]
;W[oj]C[He did too ^_^];B[rk];W[qm];B[rm];W[eb]C[R: This is big. I think white has a definite lead at this point.]
;B[om];W[ol];B[nm];W[ml];B[lj];W[mk];B[mj];W[rg]C[R: This is bad. White should just keep running in the center.]
;B[rf];W[qg];B[qf];W[kl];B[pg]C[This looks small to me.  I should have tired to buld my center a little better.

R: The problem is, a white move here could potentially turn into an attack on black later on. I think black attacked too aggressively earlier and now has to make defensive moves like this.]
;W[mh]LB[jk:A]C[R: This is a mistake. White should just play A.]
;B[jj]C[R: Good.];W[nh];B[kg];W[lg];B[kh];W[lf];B[qb]C[ensuring life to make sure I didn't DIE like my last quick game.  I already play fast enough but there are few players in the 3k-1d range on KGS who want to play a 15 or 20 min. game

R: This is very important.];W[jc]C[R: The center is really not very big. Black should split the left side and try to make a comeback there.]
;B[jd];W[kf];B[jf];W[ic]
(;B[id]C[I was thinking of jumping out at H16, but I didn't want a lot of cut points.]
;W[gc];B[me]LB[cl:A][cp:B]C[R: Very slow. Black should play something like A or B.]
;W[nf];B[mf];W[mg];B[og];W[mc];B[ke];W[il]C[I had my attack going again so I was happy.

R: But there isn't really an attack here. White is safely out into the center and black got very little out of this. The center is maybe 15 or 20 points. White connected all his stones on the top.. worth at least 20 points right there.]
;B[gl]C[too ambitious?

R: This is a good move, because black can aim at the left side after.]
;W[hk]C[R: I think this is the wrong way for white. Both players are too concerned with black's center territory.]
(;B[hi]C[Too soft?  please check my variation of this move number to confirm my thoughts.

Just push at G9. See variation.];W[kk];B[kj];W[in];B[ip]C[R: Lower would be better. (J3). Still, the left side is huge.]
;W[iq];B[jp];W[hp];B[ho];W[io];B[gp];W[hq];B[fn]C[I don't like this move.  I should have invaded around C7 now that I built up enough strength.  I lost the game when I played here I think.

R: I don't think this move is that bad.];W[hn];B[go];W[gk]
(;B[dn]C[Also a mistake I think.  I believe I was in byo-yomi around this point.

R: This move is fine.];W[co];B[cn];W[ck]C[ouch

R: This is actually an overplay.]
(;B[fq]C[Do you think I should have saved playing here since 3-3 was still open?

R: Yes, I think black needs to take some chances at this point. I would play 3-3 right away and fight.]
;W[eq]C[I didn't see this move because I was in byo-yomi.  Had I had more than one period of byo-yomi, I would have probably read that.]
;B[ep];W[fr];B[dq];W[fp];B[do];W[cp];B[fk]C[R: A little too late for this move. Overall, I think black was too persistent in his attack. As I'm sure you know, the main purpose of an attack should be to take territory and remove aji and not to try to kill your opponent. White was able to secure too much solid territory and also live with his weak group. I would recommend trying to look at the whole board a little bit more. One aspect of having a weak group, is it will make your opponent a little more uncomfortable about fighting on other areas of the board. If, for example, you had split the left side earlier, and a fight had developed, then anything leading into the center would have been to your advantage, as white may have been left with two weak groups. However, as you can see, the center did not turn into much territory at all for black, and white got most of the left side and lower left corner. I think you play a lot of solid moves, and just by improving whole board thinking and direction a little bit you will continue to get stronger.
