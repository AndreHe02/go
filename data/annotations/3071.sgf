RE[B+0.50]

C[Hello -- I would like to have a review of this game, with a focus on the opening and middle game.  I did make a blunder at towards the end (move 214).

I am playing white

Thanks in advance.

(;W[fp]LB[cq:A]C[Joseki is A, which is perfectly fine here. A double approach is usually played with a wide (three-space) pincer.]
;B[dn]LB[dm:A]C[With a wider pincer, you could play at A now - but here black can cut.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[cq];B[dq];W[cr];B[dr];W[bn];B[cs]
;W[bs];B[ds];W[ar];B[bq];W[bp]C[This is not a good result for you. You are shut in and the black wall is worth more than the few points you have got.]

(;B[dm]LB[ip:A]C[But black doesn't take profit from it. He should have pincered your lonely stone at the bottom with a move around A.]
;W[jq]C[Good. Stay away from thickness.];B[hq];W[mq]C[Also a good decision to give up your stone. Black is playing close to his powerful wall, getting not much territory.]
;B[ip]LB[ho:A]C[A is better form.];W[jp]LB[ko:A][pr:B]C[This is heavy. Play lightly when attacked, e.g. at A. B is a very interesting alternative, reducing black's corner while settling yourself.]
;B[nq]
(;W[np];B[oq];W[mp];B[pn]C[White has a heavy, still attackable position while black has got a lot of territory in the corner. Black is ahead now.]
;W[pj];B[qf];W[qe];B[pf];W[nd]C[So far, the correct reaction to black's invasion.]
;B[oh];W[qm]LB[nj:A]C[I would prefer A, attacking the black group. If you try to live on the side, you risk to get into a double attack of your two weak groups.]

(;B[ch]C[Black should first attack white's bottom group, trying to expand his moyo in the centre.]
;W[jn]C[This is a very important move.];B[io];W[jo];B[qc]C[Too small.]
;W[pc];B[re];W[rd];B[qd];W[rc];B[pe];W[qb];B[qe]C[This should be ommitted, being small and gote.]

;B[kc];W[ld];B[db];W[cc];B[cb];W[bg]C[A good defense.];B[bh]
;W[bb];B[gm];W[in];B[hn];W[jl];B[ml]LB[kh:A]C[This is of little use, black had better run out with his group at A if he wants to do something for it.]
;W[jj];B[kk];W[jk];B[mk];W[gi];B[gf];W[rn];B[ro];W[rm];B[so]

(;W[dj]LB[hr:B][ir:A]C[A bit risky. Black could try to cut (see var.).

Consider also that A is very big, being sente for both. (B is probably gote.) Moves like this one have to be played as early as they are sente - it is a gratuitous win of 6 points.]

(;B[cj]C[It's not really good for black to defend here, as white can still destroy his territory with the monkey jump.]

But the result is about the same, as A is sente for black and gote for white, so we can count as if black played here first.]
