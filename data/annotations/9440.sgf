AB[dd][dp][pd]C[Me, Kiseido 8k, taking black against Gnu Go. I play at 9 lines without handicap for tactcal practice.
At 19, I'm aiming at moyo games, trying to learn Takemiya-style stuff.
Recent results range from 80-ponit win to 40-point loss doing this. Here's a close one. 

Ben.  Greetings, I would consider just taking black without a handicap if you are trying to learn to play "cosmic go" since in a handicap game of 3 stones the white player is practically forced to try and play low, grab territory and try to overconcentrate black's stones as much as possible, on the flipside black must opt for thickness as this is often the best route for him to take.  In short black is more or less forced into a big moyo game when you have a handicap, which is fine if all you want to do is play handicap games I suppose.  However I think to really learn what it means to play in this manner you have to let go of all the tethers and take on an opponent in an even game.  Another really good thing to do is to play over Takemiya's games as well as the other professionals who play this way, there are actually quite a number.]
;W[oq];B[jc];W[cn]C[Ben.  At this point, if black's is planning to build a moyo a pincer would probably the best bet.  However the move played in the game is fine I think.]
;B[fp];W[ck]SQ[cn]C[Ben.  The best move now is to kick as white has played the marked stones too closely together.  He should have gone b4 in attempt to settle a group in the area, or d10 if he wanted to play "faster".]

(;B[jq];W[qp];B[jg]C[I considered all three hoshi points on line 10, k6, k15, q7. Picked this.

Ben.  A play about Q10 is the biggest move on the board at the moment.]
;W[ch]C[Ben.  Oddball computer move.];B[pj]C[Better a solidifying move? f16, c14, q14, ..?

Ben.  This is the best move on the board in my opinion.  Although black might have considered c14 as well.  Note that the positioning of k13 now seems awkward, it would appear to gel better with the positioning of black's other stones if it were moved three spaces down to k10.]

(;W[pg]C[Ben.  White has really burnt bridges on the left side, so this move here is actually decent.  White cannot really think about playing about f17 now, black would reply with c14.  If white approached from the other side by playing c14 himself black would just kick - c15 followed by f16.]
;B[ne]C[Ben.  This leaves behind room for white to make life on the top potentially, why not just o16?  White didn't choose to take advantage of this possibility in the game.]
;W[fd];B[cf]C[Ben. Excellent]
(;W[ql]SQ[ne]C[Ben.  Following up on my earlier comment about the position of the marked stone, see the variation..]

(;B[qj]C[Better to run out?

Ben.  Heavy, I would probably say better to just tenuki, there are so many big places on the board yet.  Even if white had another play in this area what would he do?]
;W[hc]
(;B[ie];W[qh]
(;B[oh]C[Ben.  This move appears to have one purpose only.  A wise player told me that in go a double purpose move beats a single purpose move, and a triple purpose move beats a double purpose move and so on.  Strive to find moves that do more than one thing.  Try to combine attack and defense.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[ff]
(;B[dc]C[Want to run out, not sure I can

Ben.  Black is probably alive even without this move I believe, although white can probably make life pretty hard for him if he doesn't do something.  I wonder if e17 is more testing.  Also I might rather prefer keeping the white group cut off by playing at d13 now, although the move played appears solid and virtually gaurantees black life for a long time to come.]
;W[ol]
(;B[nj]C[Ben.  Small, see these other moves.  Also s15 basically kills white on the top.]
;W[lq]
(;B[jo];W[bp];B[cq];W[re];B[rd];W[ri];B[rj];W[rg]C[Ben.  Tenuki here now, Q15 could be a ko threat later and it is basically a hoshi point otherwise.]
;B[pe]C[Ben.  Aji-keshi, as I stated before, this is sente but it is only worth a couple points and you can take it at any time (if white played here instead it would be gote for him).]
;W[qf]
(;B[og]C[Ben.  Very small, see alternatives.];W[fb];B[dg];W[fh]
;B[dh];W[di]
(;B[db]C[Ben.  I would probably try to work to keep the white groups split.]
;W[bq]
(;B[cr]C[Ben.  B6 is the biggest move locally, however black probably doesn't have many opportunities left at getting in n4 or q7 or something like that.]
;W[fn]
(;B[go]C[Ben.  Small, pratically hoshi, white's move was wishy washy, what can he do to you if you do  not play at g5?  Remember if you have more stones in an area then you have the advantage.]

Ben.  Right this is probably 1 point in gote.  Is the marked white group alive?  If it is alive black can probably shed away a number of points cutting it off I think.]
;W[sd]C[Ben.  Probably better to play as in the variation.]

(;B[sc];W[rc];B[se];W[rb];B[sd];W[pf]
(;B[of]C[Ben.  Maybe 2 or 3 points in reverse sente, other plays were much bigger.]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[kr];B[jr];W[sl]C[Ben.  Consider if you had gotten the last three sente plays in yourself.]

(;B[jj]C[Ben.  This looks like a hoshi point, unless you are gearing up for an attack on white's top group, but even then he can connect now if he wants to.]
;W[gi]C[Ben.  Which he does, in fine fashion I might add (better than the dull e11 anyway).]

Ben.  You did well in the opening, your fuseki and your endgame were for the most part good.  I think in this game, where you struggled the most was when to tenuki in the middle to late middlegame stages.  Don't blindly reply in an area just because your opponent has played there.  In some cases there were significantly bigger plays in other areas of the board and yet you replied to your opponents move almost as if you were obligated to.  Also do not leave out the possibility of a true tenuki as well, that is to say you play alway from the locally attacked area in another area of the board where your play is equally as big.  This is probably especially important in moyo go (you cant build a giant moyo in one area of the board without tenuki, especially in an even game).  Then you have to master the fine art of playing lightly with your weak stones, make life, and using your influence to your advantage.  And definetely play against humans, computers will only confuse you with their oddball plays in the openingi and early middlegame (move 12 for instance).  If you have any questions let me know!]
