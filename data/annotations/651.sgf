C[Hi!      White asked me to comment on this game on the Go teaching ladder. Some questions were provided which I have marked with "Q:". /NicklasE      Q: Black got a "double wing", or two sides and a corner or few. What should I have done differently to prevent this?      You can let your opponent get it if you get a better result. But we will see. It is right in the beginning you have to change.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[cd];B[qk]C[Ok, B is playing a low chinese opening. The aim for B here is to get a stone around K4 (or sligtly left of it) and get both territory on the lower side or right side as well as influence. To avoid this W should play around K4 now! BTW, why play C16 and C4? They have a little bit too low position in contrast to the B position on the right.]
;W[ec]C[This is too small and too to slow. What do I mean? The E17 move has only one purpose: territory. With B K4 now B will get a stone with two obvious purposes: territory and influence.]
;B[ep]C[This is one way of getting a B stone around K4, if W does not pincer.]
;W[dn]C[Q: Would a pincer be better?      Probably yes! Another possibility is to tenuki and play against the LR corner.]
;B[gq]C[Strange move. I think B should have played F4 instead of E4, then there would be more natural followups now. If think one of the standard joseki is C3 in this position.]
;W[cj]C[Too slow again. This move is only for territory and you will need more stones to actually secure it. Instead of C10 you should make sure to get some influence of the right or lower side of the board.]
;B[lp]C[And now the problem is more obvious. W have to do something about this formation by B. Although there are many weak points it will be very hard for W to reduce.]
;W[kc];B[hc]C[I don't like this move by B. It is just trouble which W should take advantage of. The simple way is just to chase to possible B group and make sure to get some desired stones on the board while chasing. It is of interest for W to get stone in the center in order to make an efficient attack the B formation on the right.]
;W[nc]C[I think this is a very good move. It actually attacks the H17 stone! If B wants to save it W will get strong in the center and could then reduce B right side and also lower side.]
;B[pc]C[Territory move again! Later W R14 or R13 will be nice.]
;W[je]LB[hc:A]C[Q: Is there a better way of applying pressure on A?      This a good move, play from your weaker group against your stronger group. But what are your intensions? B might get out or live and if he does you want something in return. A good aim here is to get some stones in the center to be able to play R13 and in the lower right corner. I would have played L15 instead.]
;B[he];W[fe]C[To close maybe. There is no eyespace so just make sure he doesn't kill you and also you would like to secure some territory on the left. Maybe E14 would be better?]
;B[hg];W[jg];B[ff];W[ef];B[fg];W[eg];B[qg]C[Now you see that B could make to forcing moves to get a free way out and also got the R13 stone. What did W get in return? Just secured some territory on the left. The K15 and K13 stone do not have much influence on the right side. They are too far away.]
;W[qm]LB[qp:A][om:B]C[Q: This sort of play is new for me.  My thought was that A and B are miai. Pointers in this area might be particularly helpful.      It is hard to make a good move here. Even if you live with the R7 stone B will secure territory both above and under. You would have needed some more stones in the center. If you could have attacked the B H13 more first it would have been great.]
;B[qo];W[om];B[ok];W[mm];B[ne]C[Ohhh, bad move by B. B should keep on chasing here.]
;W[md]C[Is B O15 sente against the W group? I don't think you have time for that.]
;B[me];W[le]C[Enough is enough...play around your N7 group instead.]
;B[np];W[km];B[fb]C[B should have tried to get in between the W K13 group and the W L7 group and thus linking up the H13 group.]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[fh];B[gf]C[Empty triangle is almost always the wrong move!]
;W[fn]C[Now it is starting to look bad for B. W is securing some territory on the left and also getting some control over the center.]
;B[ip];W[gi];B[ih];W[jh];B[ii];W[ji];B[hj];W[gj];B[hk]C[Good idea to chase to B group. Just make sure you get some profit out of it.]
;W[gk];B[hl];W[hn];B[gl];W[fl];B[gm];W[gn];B[fm];W[em];B[fk]
;W[el];B[eh];W[ei];B[gh];W[dh];B[jj];W[kj];B[jk];W[kk];B[jl]
;W[kl];B[pm];W[pn];B[pl];W[on];B[qn];W[mf]C[What is the point with this move? How about starting to think about the bad aji on the lower side?]
;B[nf];W[mg];B[ng];W[mh]C[Who is build most territory with these moves?]
;B[nh];W[ni];B[oi];W[nj];B[nk];W[oj];B[pj];W[mk];B[ea];W[da]
;B[fa];W[db];B[nd];W[mc];B[ob];W[nb];B[oc];W[po]C[Empty triangle again! How about L4,L3,N3,D2,E3?]
;B[pp]C[Who got the most out of this exchange? What had happend if B were allowed to play Q5 before W? Q5 was a gote move for B, so this was a bad exchange:(]
;W[dr];B[dq];W[cq];B[er];W[ds];B[es];W[dp];B[eq];W[cr]C[And B got sente and W didn't get many points.]
;B[eo];W[do];B[en]C[Cut first think later...this could be good for B.]
;W[jn];B[jm];W[ko];B[kp]C[Ohhh no, B is securing the lower side.]
;W[jo];B[jp];W[mo];B[no];W[nn];B[lo];W[ln];B[mp];W[ib];B[ic]
;W[jc];B[hb];W[ia]C[Consider not playing those moves!];B[ha]
;W[jb];B[id]C[It is end game moves now (and has been since a while back). In the end game you should find the biggest moves. It is possible to calculate.]
;W[nl];B[oo];W[ol];B[pk];W[li];B[jd];W[kd];B[if];W[jf];B[im]
;W[in]C[Why not H5?];B[ho];W[go];B[gp];W[io];B[hp];W[mn]C[It is a KO. Don't fill it in yet!]
;B[hi];W[fo];B[fp];W[qp];B[rp];W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[qb]C[Not neccessary.]
;W[ig];B[ie];W[ro];B[qq];W[rn];B[qp];W[rl];B[rk];W[sk];B[pi]
;W[rj];B[si]C[Bad move! S12 is enough I think. There is no eye space.]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[qh];B[qi];W[tt];B[ph]
(;W[tt];B[tt];AE[fk][ro][rn][qm][rj][ri][rl][sk];W[tt]C[Q: The game is over.  Final score:   White = 95 territory + 1 captures + 0.5 komi = 96.5   Black = 96 territory + 2 captures = 98   Black wins by 1.5.      IGS said Black won by a larger margin.  Why might IGS and cgoban disagree sometimes?      WinIGC says B+6.5 if you remove the dead stones in the scoring provided by WinIGC but B+0.5 if you score after the dead stones are removed. Apparently the dead stones are not added to the score.  Look also at the variation at the end where the dame stones are added. W has to fill in L6. The correct score is B+7.5.
   I think if W had played slighty more aggresivly at the end and attacked the lower side group the score had been the other way around. But you should be aware that it is very hard to play with these large moyos. They should be reduced by making sure you get good influence by strong moves in the beginning.]
