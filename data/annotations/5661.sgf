AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hello reviewer. Thank you ahead of time for reviewing my mistake filled game!(I am black by the way)

* hi, I'm kex (Jouni), at 15k+ at IGS currently.  I hope you find my comments useful.  I prepend them with the asterisk.

* some of my sequences can be wrong, so double-check them yourself.

* as a general concept, my main advice is to try to look first if there are bigger points around.  If you feel you should defend, check first what would happen if you do not defend, and if the damage is not big, try to make a more important move somewhere else.

* you asked for book recommendations.   Since you already have the Janice Kim series, you can find many things there already.  Some other books that might be interesting:

- Opening Theore Made Easy (Otake Hideo).  This could help in the beginning to grasp some initial ideas about thickness and what direction to play.

- Tesuji (James Davies).  You are now on a level where this book can already be recommended.  But be prepared for tough study - one chapter is much more work than the whole Janice Kim series.  This is essential reading if you wish to become stronger.  Or, actually, reading is not enough.  You need to make all the exercises.  If you get tired, have a break of some days.  It can take more than a couple of months to read the book.

- Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go (Kageyama Toshiro).  This is a "must" after you finish Tesuji.  This puts the learned things into the right perspective.]

(;B[mo]C[Should that move have been lower like around N4?

* I would play in the other direction.  I included two variations that continue with pretty standard continuations and one that tries to strengthen the R6 stone in a simple way.]
;W[qm]C[The saying, "Your opponents move is your best move" or somthing close to that, deal with what just happened becuase my rigth stone is now very weak?]

(;B[oo]SQ[dp]C[trying to ut the group.

* this is the first major mistake.  Actually you just strengthen the white group as the result.

Instead, you should work with your N5 stone to grab influence towards left, where you have your supporting stone (marked) as the other side.]
;W[pn]
(;B[no]C[* this move is wrong.  Now your stones are weak but right next to the white group.  you should play your move 10 directly]
;W[po];B[nq];W[mm];B[nn]C[* this move is bad, since white wants to strengthen the wall and now you force it.  So it is a "thank-you move"]
;W[nm];B[lm];W[jq]
(;B[hq]TR[lm][nn][mo][no][oo][nq]C[maybe a cap would have been better?

* perhaps, but I doubt.  But your marked group is actually quite weak so it is not wise to push white towards it.]
;W[jo]
(;B[hn]TR[nn][mo][no][oo][nq]C[Or here?

* your group on the right is still weak.  You need to worry about it.  but the cap is better now.

* Always check before attacking that your gun is working.  This time your gunpowder is wet, since the triangled stones are too weak.  Now you actually force white to make problems for you]
;W[jm];B[il];W[jl];B[dj]C[* well...  you do get a moyo, but white has now got in practice one quarter of the board as secure territory.  Moyos are invaded, and you will not get the full moyo as territory, so you are now probably a bit behind.]

* I think now it is late, but if you can make a ko-fight somewhere else, you can use the moves here to make life.  The idea is that to get this group live, you need two moves in a row, so if you use the moves as ko-threats, then if the opponent takes the ko, you get life.]
