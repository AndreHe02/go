C[W might do better with a pincer.  D3 is low and may not easily make a
large area extending toward the B stone at Q4]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fq];B[de]
C[D10 or 11 better for B. 
 If W then extends to C12, B can invade later with the assistance of
  the B D10 group.]
;W[ci]C[Good dual purpose move.];B[ec];W[dd];B[ed];W[ce];B[cf];W[df];
B[ee];W[bd];B[dg]
C[Looks good for B at this point.
    The B wall will work well with the B stones on the right.]
;W[cg]C[Best W can do.];B[bf]
C[B should just capture and extend to D12 
if W plays B14];W[ef];B[eg]

C[Decent result for W after poor start.  B has some thickness and W
has territory.]
;W[ck];B[ek];W[el]C[I like W E11 rather than W E8];B[dl]
C[B should consider D9 instead of D8.  Then W D8, C8, C7, B8, B7,
 B9, trading left center for 3 B stones at D6]

C[W H9 perhaps better than G9.  Doesn't leave the cutting point];B[fl]
;W[ij];B[hi];W[hj];B[go];W[hp];B[pj]
C[Now W maybe ahead in territory but B has compensation on right side.
   But W has influence in center and also sente move at E12 to make 
   shape.]
;W[ho]
C[Too small.  Doesn't threaten or secure any group. 
  Better at E12 or R14]
;B[mq];W[eh];B[fh];W[qf]
C[Possibly W at Q17 would be better.  W can try for a large territory
 across the top - but also important to keep B from consolidating right
  side]

C[If W wins this ko by taking at T15 that is sente for W, so not 
a good Ko for B.]
;B[rc];W[em];B[gm];W[rd];B[nf];W[se];B[rf];W[oi]
C[Good result for W so far. Now W needs to settle these stones so 
as to get to R4 or J16 before B]
;B[mi]C[B is chasing W into B territory.  Perhaps B should P10];W[nj]
C[I would probably play W P10 not O10 but a hard choice];B[mj];W[nk];
B[pm]C[Now B must protect this area, easing pressure on W];W[ml]
C[Again I would play at N10, seems stronger for W.  W at O10 
and N8 seem to give B an easy game in this area.]
;B[qp]C[closes door.  W not settled yet.];W[kq];B[mo];W[pl];B[ql];
W[qm]C[Just Q9 for W here];B[om];W[qk];B[rl];W[ol];B[qi];W[rk];B[rm];

C[This is a 2 step Ko for B.  S 19 threatens to kill if B 
ignores 2 ko  threats]
