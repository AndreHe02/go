C[I (lietzang)play black in this game and won by 7.5 with a .5 komi.
I won this game and I feel I played solidly throughout, but obviously, as only an 11k beating an 8k, there is much room for improvement.

A-Original Move
B,C,D,etc-Variation];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp]C[I used to do P3 and then follow with R4, but R4 seems to leave more better options than P3.

Well, I think since you shimari'd with P3-R4 and R4-P3, it really doesn't leave much of a difference. Both are the same, and their just fine.]

(;B[jc]LB[pj:A][qj:D][jp:C][jq:B]C[Is this or R10 better?  Somewhere around there becomes urgent for white, correct.

Yes this is correct. The biggest moves on the board are R/Q10 and K3/4.]

(;W[pj]LB[pl:A][ql:B]C[Q8 could have been lower at R8 to force a move around S9 and R14.]

(;B[pl];W[qf]LB[qe:A][of:C][pf:B]
(;B[qe];W[pf];B[md]C[Seems like this doesn't settle the corner, but allows for a flexible attack on white's Q14 stones.  Is this correct?  What are better moves?

Well I beleive this doesn't create a GREAT attack shape for black.  If you wantes a good attack shape I think N16 should Be O16 and black would need S15, as well as R9. Then I believe it would be a good group to attack. See variation for better moves.]
;W[hc];B[ci]C[seems urgent to me.

Great move.];W[ce];B[cl]C[Whites moves are  rather slow though. gave black that grou so easily.]
;W[bn];B[jp];W[hq];B[iq]C[I played this with the thought that he would get his monster corner, I would get mine, and mine was bigger]
;W[hp];B[qk];W[qj];B[re];W[rf];B[cg]LB[ol:A][kq:B]C[we now both have 2 corners and 2 sides apiece, all fairly solid]

(;W[ol]C[this series of moves seems misguided on whites part in that it allows me a solid and big territory, with only a minimal gain in thickness on white's part, as I am able to cut.

Yes this is a bit too early. A move around N6 would reduce black majorly. Or N/M3. Could create a pretty interesting fight maybe. A move at M3 isn't so bad either.]

(;W[lf]C[seems like white should have killed my group of 3 instead here with a move at k10]
;B[ki];W[jf];B[kj];W[lk];B[kk];W[qh];B[ir];W[hr]C[I don't belive its sente at all. It looks more like a sente move for white.]

Well its hard to lose that group. But yes it wouldn't be a difficult  fight I think.]
;W[ej]LB[ei:B][el:A]C[not quite sure the best way to deal with this.  it worked out, but are there better ways?

At this point I'm not so sure myself. But I would probably play E8 or E11. Depending on that I'm going for.]

Well this isn't quite sente causewhite has some much large points elsewhere. and even if he didn't play N11 it would be in gote.]

White has an estimated, 8 points at bottom, 6 at right, 8 at top left. 

While black has a possible 20 at top, and 15 and bottom right, as well as a possble move at C8 to create another group, or invade. He also has the extention at K4 as well. this puts him rather far ahead.]
