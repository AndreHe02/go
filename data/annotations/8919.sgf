C[sskk21: Hi!];B[pd];W[dp]C[Hi, my name is Fabian. 
I hope you can get something out of this review. When you have some additional questions or if you want to give some feedback you can contact me at dexterward361@gmx.de.

You haven't lost because of big tactical mistakes. Both of you have played quite normal moves. 

But you have started your actions at the wrong locations. In the result you have helped your opponent or created weak groups.]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]MA[po][qo]C[i honestly don't know how to deal with this style of play. i only started to see it when i reached my current rank.

Black has played the chinese opening. It is very popular when you like to fight. I will show you some typical variations.
Black hopes that White plays X.]
(;W[df]C[F: This move is faster, but the connection of the two stones is not so strong. ( Compare it to the one-point-jump)]
;B[cn]
(;W[cl]C[F: A Pincer, low and near. Usually you play this move to deny your opponent a base. But you also have to be prepared for an immediate response. Locally you have to care about two groups, your opponent has only one group to develop.
In this situation i prefer a for low pincer at 'a'. There some variations. White has more "time" to protect the lower left corner stone

My tip: When you want to save the pincer and the corner stone (while the support of other stones is not overwhelming) play a far pincer. When you have very good support on the side or you want to settle your shape quickly you can choose the near pincer.]
;B[en];W[fp];B[bp]
(;W[el]LB[cq:A]C[was this a good idea?
F.: No, look for the comment at move 8...

I think that i understand your intention. You want to build up a framework.
Yet, you haven't learned to sacrifice a stone. You want defend everything. That is not possible.
When you defend you have to aware of your priorities: A group of two stones has more value than a single stone, so have to defend the more valueable group first!

But White 12 was a good idea, if you have seen the fencing-in-move. ;) If not, it is urgent for white to defend at 'A'. ( making a base )]
;B[cq]TR[dp][fp]LB[fn:A]C[Black has robbed White's base, the black group is safe. The marked white group is weak. In such situations ( your opponent is strong, your group is weak ) you should not defend everything. Instead you should consider speedy developement moves ( playing lightly )

Here you can find an even better option: Fencing in at A. - When you can connect a weak group with another group, do it.]
(;W[dq]TR[dp][fp]MA[hq]LB[bo:A]C[You just have created a nice target for your opponent. :)  Your stones are overconcentrated and heavy. As Black i would play at X at once. After this attack, you have no base (eyespace), so you have to run. Black can develope the bottom side while attacking you.

However: When you are good at reading, you can come to another judgement: See the variation at 'A' to discover the aji...]
(;B[mq];W[kq]TR[dp][dq][fp]SQ[cn][en][bp][cq][mq][pq]MA[hq]
LB[fn:A][iq:B]C[The marked group is weak, So what was the meaning of move 16? Do you want to save  the group with one move? Than the extension is too wide. Because Black has stable positions on both sides this position cries for an invasion on 'x'.

Alternatives: The fencing-in-move on 'a' is still working. For a side extension ( meaning: Safety first) i would play on 'b# 

Blendig out the weak group: The top is wide open for both sides, so it is important to get the first move.]
;B[ic]TR[cl][el][dp][dq][fp]LB[ie:A]C[It is not easy to find a good answer on this move. But because black has extension stones on both sides from the 4-4-stone in the upper right, you can consider a 3-3-invasion in future.
But you still have the burden to defend your weak groups.
Usually, before you play elsewhere you need to make your groups safe.

A move on 'A' is a calm move. This move increase your potential in the center and is also a question to black.]
;W[kc];B[fc]TR[dc][df]C[Because of the loose connection betwenn the marked stones, it will be easier for black to settle his group.]
;W[nc]
(;B[oc];W[nd];B[pf]TR[po][qo]C[Ok, you want to make an invasion. Your opponent will response on your invasion, so you have to make sure that you don't damage your own groups. That's why the lower right may be more suitable for an invasion.]
;W[qi]TR[fc][ic][kc][nc][nd]C[That is too early. Before you invade, you have to check that your own groups are safe. The marked groups are not completly safe. Whoever makes the first move has the privelege to attack the opponent.
There is another reason why this is a bad move: You INDUCE the next move black 25, which is a natural answer on your move.  Later how you ask me how to deal with the big moyo in the lower right. Here is one answer: Don't help your opponent to make good moves! ;)]
;B[ok];W[rf];B[rd];W[qe];B[pe];W[qd];B[qc];W[rj];B[rk];W[oi]
;B[pn]SQ[qd][qe]TR[rf][qi]C[How to deal with a moyo? Part I
This invasion was not good. Black got many moves for free in the lower right to solidfy his moyo which is almost safe territory now.

You should learn: Don't make an invasion, when you are helping your opponent or damaging your own position!

Note: The connection between the stones marked with triangles is only safe, when you sacrifice the stones markes with the squares. So the white group is rather weak.]
(;W[fe]LB[ff:A]C[It is good idea to attack from that direction because you will extend your own moyo. But shape is not good. A normal one-point-jump on 'A' is simple and does his job.]
;B[ed];W[dd];B[ee];W[de];B[ef];W[eg];B[ff];W[fg];B[gf];W[je]
;B[ie];W[jf];B[jp];W[jq];B[ip];W[iq];B[hp];W[hq];B[kp]C[Black has played a mild reduction instead of possible invasion. The result is very good for you, because your group at the bottom is perfectly safe now.]
(;W[gm];B[cr]LB[re:A][lq:B]C[You have sente. You should consider 'A'. It repairs your defects and more important threatens the eyespace of the black group.

At the bottom you should push at 'B'. 

Tip: Before you play a defensive move, always check for forcing and sente moves.]
(;W[dr];B[lq];W[gg];B[if];W[ig];B[gp];W[gq];B[jj]LB[im:A]C[How to deal with a moyo? Part II

In this position the black moyo is still wide open, but black doesn't need many moves to close the gate. Black 65 is a threat to enclose a big territory and it also reduces your center moyo.
Don't defend automatically. ( What you do with your next move. )
The magic words: Mutual reduction: Do you consider a move on 'A' ? At the moment the reduction of blacks moyo is quite easy... Look at the variation]
(;W[hj];B[fo];W[ep];B[il]TR[kl][ll][ml][km][lm][mm]C[how could i have dealt with the massive region in the lower right?

At this point i do not see a good solution anymore. White has to make an aggresive invasion to catch up. A good opportunity to learn fighting under bad conditions. ;)

The point is that you don't have to learn super-complicated tesuji combinations to deal with this. The trick is to completly avoid such situations at ealier stages in the game.]
;W[hl]C[When you think that the black moyo becomes too big you should not help to solidify the moyo, even when your position is unstable. The reduction of the moyo has priority.]
;B[im]
(;W[mj]C[You are behind in territory. This is the last chance to reduce the big moyo, So this move is not enough.]
