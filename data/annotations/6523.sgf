C[This was a recent game of mine. For this game, I am ranked as 8kyu, and my opponent is 6kyu; I was white, and the game was played with no handicap. I lost by 1.5.

I have many problems with fuseki and even mid-game strategies, and also struggle some with basic life and death problems. I'm hoping that maybe you could help some! Thank you very much! :DDD]

1.Does this stone threaten to cut my opponent?

If he didn't play here.Black will lose some points, but will be alive.See variation

This is the last note.Overall, you played pretty well but you should pay more attention on the following things.
1.Whether a stone is worth saving.
2.BIg points in the opening
3.Common tesujis
