C[Hi Erwin,

Here's your review. Enjoy!];B[pd];W[cd];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq]
(;W[fc]LB[qj:A]C[Normally, white wants to split the right side at A first before making his own enclosure.  Please see the variations.]

(;B[jc]
(;W[mc]C[R10 is still the biggest move.  Locally, this allows black to strengthen the corner at P17.  Please see the variation.]
;B[oc];W[ld]C[This is a bit slow.  A one-point jump at N15 is sufficient.]
;B[pg];W[qk]C[Because you don't have room to make a base on either side (a 2-point extension), playing this on the 4th line would be safer.]
;B[qi]C[Black extends from the wrong side.];W[qn];B[je];W[mf]
C[M14 is fine here. This leaves white with an awkward shape, and leaves less pressure on black.]
;B[nd]C[And now black exploits white's weakness.];W[kc]C[Attaching to black only helps him strengthen his stones.  Instead, L14 protects against the cut.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[fe];W[ed];B[gc];W[gd];B[hc];W[fd];B[hf];W[nb]
C[White shouldn't be worried about making eyes unless he absolutely has to.  L14 still removes that cut.]
;B[ob];W[dg];B[hd];W[ge];B[gg];W[jq]C[Good. This is a really big move.  I would also consider the D9 area, because this side is already developing.]
;B[lq];W[gq]C[This flattens the side.   Jumping up at K5 is better, and it also helps indirectly with the 2 stone group to the right (R6 and 9).]
;B[dn];W[cn];B[cm];W[co];B[dm];W[cj]C[Good!  Just be aware that there's some bad aji in the corner, because G3 is a bit farther away.]
;B[go];W[jo]C[You have the right idea with jumping up, but It's very important that white covers up that weakness in the corner by playing F4 now.  It also leaves black's 4 stones ready to attack.]
;B[lo];W[oo]C[White doesn't have to be so awkward with his shape.  P9 is preferable, because it has more breathing room in the center.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[op];W[mp]C[White is not strong enough to attack.]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[mo];W[he];B[ie];W[if];B[kf];W[ig];B[fg];W[ii]
C[Very well-played!  Black now has a few weak groups to worry about.]
;B[gi]
(;W[fb]C[Attacking the weak groups below is more important.   I would start with either G7 or G9 first, to build up an attack on the bottom.  Please see the variation for one idea.]
;B[kh];W[ji];B[gk];W[lb];B[me];W[le];B[lf];W[mg];B[ki];W[mi]
;B[kk];W[ik];B[mk];W[nj];B[lj];W[pj]C[O9 is much simpler, but white also has to worry about the dragon to the left, and his own splitting stones. J7 is really important.]
;B[jm];W[im];B[jl];W[il];B[in];W[gl];B[ek];W[gn];B[jn];W[hn]
;B[ho];W[fo];B[io];W[fl];B[dj];W[ck];B[dk];W[cl];B[em];W[fn]
;B[bm];W[ci];B[df];W[eg];B[ef];W[cf];B[de];W[ce];B[dd];W[gf]
C[White doesn't even really have to take this, since it's a false eye anyway.  It's much simpler to just get D17 immediately.]
;B[ff]C[Now D17 is critical.  You want to make as clean a kill as possible, and not give black any chance to make something from complications in the fight.]
;W[hg];B[dc];W[di];B[ei];W[fk];B[fj];W[cc];B[eh];W[gp];B[do]

;W[an];B[am];W[ak];B[aj];W[bj];B[ao];W[nk]C[Again, you want to make as clean a kill as possible.  A4 is really important.]
;B[hi];W[jg];B[hj];W[hk];B[ij];W[jj];B[jk];W[kg];B[lg];W[ic]
;B[id]
(;W[lh]C[This is where the problems begin, because white is too greedy.  Connecting at J18 is the simplest thing you can do, if b connects at M12, then W K19.  Resisting doesn't work for black.]
;B[ib]C[W must H19.];W[ke];B[ha];W[jf];B[jd];W[db]C[Now white has to fight a two-step ko.]
;B[ep];W[ea];B[eq];W[dq];B[eo];W[fp];B[da];W[dl];B[el];W[ea]
;B[er];W[ec];B[ko];W[br]C[What about B3?];B[aq];W[dr];B[ar]

[os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[This was a good game.  Your opening was good, and the attack on black's dragon was very nice!   

Suggestions: 

* The odd shapes (i.e. a keima/small knight's move instead of a one-point jump) leave your stones in an unnecessarily awkward position, and leave weaknesses for your opponent to exploit later, so try to avoid this.

*  After you kill a group of stones, especially a dragon, try to keep the situation as simple as possible, and avoid complications.   What happened at the top in this game was decisive.

* It's important to not become concerned with small moves, when there are far bigger ones. Don't worry about making eyes until you need to, or escape into the center if the situation calls for it.

I hope you found this review helpful!    If you have any questions about it, please feel free to send an e-mail.

(;W[qj]LB[ql:A]C[Once white splits the right side, black's big move is gone; he can only make a much smaller 3-point extension at A.  Also, note that direction is very important here, black wants to extend from the side that's developing the fastest (the bottom in this case).]
