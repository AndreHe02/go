C[This is a game between me (davidnies), white and baxiwax, black. Every player had 30 minutes time. I really tried hard to do my best - but this obviously didn't work. Once, I had a rank of almost 4k - now I get beaten by 6k's... I really don't understand this.

One of my problems is to estemate wheather a situation on the board is good for me or bad.

I really don't know where my mistakes are... If you can suggest some Go literature, I would be very happy... Until now, I have read most of the books from the "Elementary Go Series" by James Davies - but I do not seem to have understood them.

Thanks for your help! :)

A: I'm Andy.  I will preface my commentary with "A:" so you know it's me speaking.   I am 2k at the moment and so not that far ahead of you.  We are at the stage when you start to have to study joseki, endgame, and middle-game tactics more carefully and advancing gets a little slower.  Overall, in this game, neither of you had weak groups or big life and death struggles or epic ko fights.  It was a territory type game and you were both pretty steady and so the big decider was the efficiency of your stones and your endgame.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc]C[I am really weak in joseki - so I tried do use some patterns I feel comfortable with... or at least not so unconmfortable...]
;B[de]C[A: b and c are options here.  Look up some joseki for them and they will come in handy.  The idea is to let black get some influence, but to make sure you have strong positions on the top and left to work from]

(;W[ce]C[A: see variation];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[gc]C[Is this move too close? I thought that having strong corners will help me throughout the whole game - that's why I played there.

A: No.  Too far!  F16 and F17 are usual here.  Black has to play at C9.  If you play F16, your next move is at K17 and you have a wide position at the top.  If you play at F17, then you have a smaller, but very strong, corner position, and, since black has to move at c9 or thereabouts, you have sente to play a big move somewhere else.  G17 is only a tiny bit differnt than f17, and at 2k, I can't promise I'm the one to tell you what it is, but likely it is that if black later plays at J17, the position is slightly reducible.]
;B[ck];W[eq]C[Too close? Again, I wanted to strengthen my corner...

A:e12 is very big.  Not as big maybe as if black didn't have that group there, but still, c7 is big follow up. I can't fault this move]
;B[pj];W[qn]C[Here I wanted to reduce the potential black has on the right side...

A: Still, it is usually not the best idea to start reducing a sanrensei from the inside.  R14 can get beat up on by the black stones and that makes Q10 a very valuable stone, working nicely with Q16 Start at O3 or O17 is better.

Book recommendation: A Dictionary of Modern Fuseki: The Korean Style. Kiseido Publishing Company.  Lots of good ideas about joseki and fuseki and just the level of analysis that you are asking about.  I just started reading it myself on recommendation from a teacher.  Not that low kyu players need to player better than pros in the 1960s!  Still, seems like a good book.]
;B[mq]
(;W[qk];B[qj]C[I played move 16 to enable the following variation...

A: Not sure which variation you are discussing, but your two stones aren't alive yet, and black is starting a nice position up top with R17, an ideal move with Q16.  I wouldn't tenuki here ... I might want to make sure of those two stones.  I don't like R9 because it asks black to strengthen his stones and doesn't settle your group.  I'd go right for S4 now, then, assuming black takes the corner with R3, follow with R8.  See variation.  Your group is settled.  Black can either strengthen at R10, and you have sente and a safe group, or black can take the initiative but the right is still open.  A bit better.]

(;W[nc];B[kd]C[A: I think black is wrong here.  With those two stones, Q17 or Q14 or O16 or something that makes use of them.  white is low on top, so black gains more that way.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re]C[When I look at the positions on the whole board now, I think it is almost even... but this is surely wrong, I think. I really don't know...

A: By choosing the wall direction facing your upper left strong group, rather than facing his mini wall at q10, he has give you a break.  He does have influence.  He is ahead if you count your lower right stones as dead, of course, but they have options.]
;B[qd]C[A: Not your move, but silly.  Reduces black liberties, changes nothing else, waste of a ko threat maybe]
;W[rd];B[nd]C[A: This on the other had is a good move.  "A thick move" a teacher would say.  Makes the influence real.]
;W[rp]C[I really don't know now why I didn't play the sequence in the variation after move 17... I think I thought that it would weaken my stones around R6 too much....

A: Because it would.  If you get a little corner and those two die, you'll have a long game ahead of you.  Your gut told you to save them, which is right.]
;B[qq];W[rq]C[A: You probably had to make this move or S9 to make life, which shows you that R9 is a slightly inefficient move.  Because it made a strong little black group there, S4 didn't completely settle your group. You lived in gote, which was a good idea, but black had sente to make a big move at J17]
;B[ic];W[iq]C[Too close? I wanted to keep up in the balance of territory...

A: Arguably in the right area, but neither too close nor too far.  K3 slightly better becuase if you follow upat H4, you get a nice shape that isn't overconcentrated.  If black comes in, he hasn't room to make a group so you both run and his corner group becomes vulnerable to an invasion at p3.  Black tenuki'd when you played S3; use that fact.  You might even play L3 here, followed by J4.  A slight difference, but you guys were playing this game on slight differences.  But if you want to just make territory in a slow way, H3 is better because no invasion is possible.]

(;B[gp]
(;W[io]C[I thought G2 would be too submissive...

A: G2 would be too submissive, I think.  This is, at least, a spirited response, but keep in mind when you attack one thing, like G4, that you want other benefits.  How about L3 instead, strengthen that slightly misplace stone and threaten an invations of lower right.  If he responds, you get  the big move in front of your shimari, not him.  See var.]
;B[cn]
(;W[fo]C[When I played J5, I thought of the sequence that follows now - or at least of something like that - and I thougt that it would be good for me.

A: This is really good if you kill G4.  I tried out two things. One is pretty bad for you, one is really good.  Have a look. This is just fighting/reading.  In grand strategy terms, you want to stay away from G4 and keep it from getting stronger. E5 would be better than F5.  By deciding to go out and not connect you are conceding that you might have two groups here.  Well the J3 group would be weaker, plus black has central influence, while your stones in the lower left are strong.  So ... chase from the j3 group and make it stronger.  It reduces the center, while the lower left stays fine.  See other variation.]
;B[go]
(;W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[in]C[A: since you attacked from the stronger group, j3 got weaker. Either you run or submissively connect underneath.]

(;W[jn];B[im]
(;W[jo];B[jm];W[ln]C[This weakens blacks group around Q4 an strengthens my position in the centre, I thought...]
;B[on];W[rk];B[qg]C[A: Your lower left group had a slightly inefficient extension; your lower right group had a slightly ineffecient extension. You have had to spend a couple of moves keeping those stones viable.  During those moves, black got j17, R13, K7, a bunch of moves that wind up giving black a slight lead in territory]
;W[km];B[kl];W[ll]C[A:];B[fk]C[A: This is a really good move by black.  You had to play M8, but F9 is bigger.  Now, you have 3.5 corners of solid territory, while black is starting to profit in the center.  You want, in order, to keep your groups alive, then to reduce the center. You have three doors to the center, around G15, around F9 and around M8.  move 55 closes one door.  You can either walk through a door or jump down the chimney with a deep invasion and run for one of the doors.  There are a good 60-70 points in teh middle, which you can reduce with two or three moves.  That's 20-25 points a move.  B5 is endgame.  Big big endgame, but endgame, like 10 points.  You shouldn't play it yet]
;W[bo]C[A: and Black shouldn't answer it!  Look, on this, somebody may disagree with me, so you should get a second opinion.  There may be no move in the middle that benefits black as much as answering at B6, but I find it hard to believe.  G15...  M9?   I think those are both 30 point moves.]
;B[bn];W[qf]C[From now on, I tried to reduce blacks centre...]
;B[pf];W[rg];B[qh]C[A: endgame sequence at best.  makes black stronger.  You should leave it be so maybe you can use the aji of splitting at Q12 to effectuate an invasion.  I am editing using Many Faces, whose score estimator is ok.  L9 makes a 19 point lead for black to a five point lead for black.  You threaten to make a ponnuki in the center, and your follow up at M10 erases lots of black territory.  There may be other follow ups too.  Maybe there is an argument for just extending to M9 to begin with.  I don't know.  M9 just seems too big to me to ignore.]

(;W[gl];B[hk]C[A: A forcing move at least, but this door is already closed and black gets a little stronger when you do this.  Instead of any of the last three moves, why not, say, L9?

A: further analysis reveals a vulnerability in black's position. See variations.  I am not sure what to make of it, but there is some benefit to be gained from pushing throught at G9 at some point.]

(;W[ee]C[A: This attachment is good earlier in the game, but you need to plunge into the center.  g15 maybe]
;B[mj]C[A: black is building up a substantial lead here by making use of the influence he got early on.  It is getting urgent to do something about it.  I am not sure exactly what, except I think it isn't d5.   

A: Ok, I see the idea of 66, but I still think it would be more fun for you to be playing on line 10 than him.  And I think the variation you were working on doesn't work.  Have a look at my variant]

(;W[do];B[hf]C[A: The doors are closing and you have more than 30 points to make up.  By knowing good endgame, you might be able to reclaim 20 or so.]
;W[jl]C[I played move 66 because I thought of the sequence in this variation here..]

(;B[il];W[kk]C[A: Because black can answer your other attack, he should have extended from L8.]
;B[ki];W[ik];B[ij];W[jj]C[I thought that I had enough ko threads to start a ko...]
;B[hj];W[jk];B[hl];W[ji];B[kh];W[jh]C[Looking at the whole board again I think that it is working good for me

A: You are finally reducing the big black blob ... good work. But (a) everyone's groups are in good shape and (b) black is still ahead.  You should be counting every turn here and have an estimate of the score.  Anyway, you need endgame now ... perfect endgame]
;B[jg]
(;W[qr]C[Now I wantet to attack blacks weak group in the south-east to strengthen my groups. With the following moves, I tried to achieve this...

A: Your groups are strong.  You don't need to strengthen them. It is time to make points.  You are within striking distance. R2 is valuable, but at some point soon, you have to follow up with S2, losing sente.  I am not sure how to attack that group but you did ok on it.  Consider H18 and B15 first.  Both double sente and big.]
;B[pr];W[no]C[A: Here, other big endgame still beckon, plus locally M2.  It is going to be hard to kill this group, so stress it instead.]
;B[oo];W[np];B[nq];W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[po];W[lr];B[lq];W[kr]
;B[qm];W[rm];B[nn]C[A: This puzzled me.  P4 reducing group is too  big to lose.  Just play n5 here.  What's black going to do.  (except use the sente you gave him to play H18.  He's not going to save R7.  Or he shouldn't)]

(;W[pm]C[I thought this would be saver and more profitable than playing at N5..]
;B[mo];W[lo];B[mn]C[A: Seems like g2 would be better here, numerically, than L3. L3 is a couple of points in gote.  G2 is 10 points or so in reverse sente.]
;W[kq];B[gr];W[fr]C[A thread to capture G2 and giving me the possibility later to link up...]

;W[fg];B[fh];W[gm];B[hn];W[gk];B[fj];W[lp];B[mp]
(;W[bf]C[A: I ran ahead to the end and you have a sense of endgame.  It went well, but doing R2 and leaving it to get sente, and then B14 and leaving it to get sente, mean you are going to lose at least one of them.  Sometimes, just descend and hane.  You keep sente.  Look at the variation.]

Thanks for your help again!

A: This was not a terrible game for either of you.  More efficient moves, all the way through, would give you the edge.  At the start that was making better extensions on the bottom, the right and top left.  In the middle, it was gently but seriously addressing black's huge center.  In the endgame, it was just a few technical tweaks.  Your reduction of the center put you within striking distance, and then you got a high proportion of the best endgame moves.  Descending at S2 and B15 would have put you in better stead.  Also, not losing P4 group.   Two proverbs to remember (a) reduce an enemy's moyo gently (meaning to timely reduce black's upper right by carving into it carefully) and (b) attack the enemy from your weaker position, to strengthen it (meaning your center group could have used being stronger earlier to keep a handle on black's upper right.

I hope this helps.

Book Rec:  Any endgame book, though all of them in English are mediochre, still I believe studying endgame has the most bang for the buck for kyu players, and a good endgame book will cover tricks like descending instead of hane'ing.  Basics of go strategy, a pretty new book in the same series as 1001 life and death problems, "Mastering the Basics" I think, not because I think you need it but because it is really good.  In addition to the fuseki book I mentioned, you might like Opening Theory Made Easy (though you might be past it already, still worth a read) and Cho Hun-Hyun's lectures on the opening.]
