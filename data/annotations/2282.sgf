C[My 1st GTL game. I felt that I was behind early on in this game, and was lucky to win.I learned Go many years ago and have got rather stuck at 8kyu. I feel that my play lacks logic and planning. Many thanks for your time.]

rather R3 or R4];W[qo]C[
R2 perhaps a bit stronger];B[qn]C[
no make R5 better, see next move];W[po];B[qj];W[on]C[This looks very good for white

yes due to Q6 first and even R6 that tranform R5 as a good move]

C[
always bigger moves elsewere, this area is now too small];W[fp]
C[this
looks very big

yes];B[jq]C[
too late :-(];W[hq];B[mq]C[I felt that I couldn't give white
the big territory at the bottom without a fight, but am uncomfortable
playing close to his thickness. What should I have done?

better to do it earlier

I suppose you will live with about 2 points, and a lot of power + points for white  not a good result for black]
;W[nq];B[mp]C[I
was hoping to gain a move by threatening to save my cutting stone, and
thus make life at the bottom. It worked out that way.

every move now in this area, helps white making points];W[no]
;B[do]C[
good !];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[ir];W[hr];B[iq]C[why play this move ?

only because it's sente, not suffisant];W[ip];B[mr];W[nr];B[ns]
;W[os]C[White seems to be falling in with my plans hereabouts, but I'm not sure what else he should do.]

I'm not sure];W[ed];B[de];W[ee];B[df];W[ch];B[ic]C[
jalous move ?

E14 much better];W[kc];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[fe];B[hd]C[
again you will make 2 points, and white lot of power];W[eg]
;B[ci]LB[db:A]C[I
don't like this move. I have 2 weak groups at the top. To play at A
might be good, to strengthen the corner group and threaten to connect
the 2 weak groups.

yes];W[bi];B[di];W[dh];B[bg];W[ei];B[bh]LB[dk:A]C[This
was an oversight, missing that White's next move captures my 2 stones
in a ladder. To play at A might be more reasonable.


think that if you opponent leaves you such a big cut, there must be something wrong...]
;W[cj];B[dc];W[fb];B[db]LB[gb:A]C[Playing this I missed White's strong sequence. Instead a play at A might be better.

yes

but why play D17 before D18 ?, just play D18 first];W[gb]C[

I don't know, it's a tricky move anyway];B[dn];W[cm];B[dl]C[This acts as a ladder breaker, hence White's next move.]

there is no points here ?];W[ek]C[
white mistake];B[hp];W[gp];B[ho];W[fn]LB[fl:A]C[A simple capture at F8 looks better, safely connecting his centre group.

played this to ensure life at the bottom. But was it necessary? It
seems that I could have played at A immediately.

see variation, don't find way to kill];W[gm]C[A very bad mistake, after which I capture his group, gaining points while making my group safe. The losing move?

yes];B[in];W[sh];B[si];W[sg];B[ld]C[S11 didn't seem too big a threat, so I felt I should play elsewhere.

ok];W[be];B[cd];W[cg];B[bf];W[cf];B[ce];W[ah];B[ae];W[ag];B[bd]
;W[ql];B[rk]LB[ri:B][pm:A]C[This seems to be a good move, defending against white's 2 threats of A or B simultaneously.

threatening Black B later and if White C then Black D should be fun.

black wins, but the capture of 5 white stones at the middle is much more than 10 points as it seemsfirst

white didn't use all the power he made at the beginning of the game

go is a balance of power and territory, to break the 8k level, you should try to make and use more power
