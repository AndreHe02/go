C[Dear reviewer,
I played white and as a local 5k.

This was a tournament match and I  didn´t manage to remeber the  complete game but only the first part.
The game was close until the late  endgame.
Thank you very much for reviewing  this game.   Martin];B[dq]

a big territory on the left, but with two weak groups this becomes difficult.]
