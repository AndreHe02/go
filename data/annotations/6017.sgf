C[Hi.  I am the black player and this game was a disaster for me.  When I look at it I see that I was not playing with a calm mind, but some advice would be helpful.  This was one of the three games I lost in the eight-round Iwamoto Tournament.

David I will start my comments with a *.
Bert

* Just went over your game but there were 2 moves I thought were wrong. 
With both moves you switched from a moyo-based to get some direct profit. However both moves backfired to you.
The 2 moves concermed are  move 19 (at G5) and 43 (at O18).]

(;B[pb]C[Now I think O16 is more consistent with K10.  Was inconsistency a big problem (some territory moves, some influence moves) throughout the game?
