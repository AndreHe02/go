C["Hello, reviewer.
I would like a review of this game, for both black and white.
Black's a friend of mine, and he was gonna send this file in too, so we agreed to just send one, and look at it together.
There's no really specific questions, i'm affraid.
We're both looking a lot at fuseki tho, so we'd appreciate it if you could go into that a little more detailed.
And of course, anything about shape would interest us greatly.
We're both around 17-18k at KGS.
Thanks in advance."

Hello, reviewees!

This game is a little difficult to review. The main reason is that it was not exactly a serious game. You two were playing for fun, and for that, I envy you. However, the result was that you played moves you saw as questionable just to see what would happen.

Nevertheless, I'll do my best, and see if I can be of any help.

;W[cq];B[oc];W[qj];B[qh]C[This is the right direction ^^];W[qm]
;B[nq];W[jd];B[cj];W[dl]C[This took me several minutes of consideration before confirming this is probably the right direction. Do you REALLY want me to review this game? :P]
;B[cg];W[hp]C[Finally, a move I can comment on! No offense, White.

This move is cramped. The bottom side is open for an excellent and desirable extension at K4, which is what makes White's previous move at D8 better than my desired move at D12. White holds himself back unnecessarily.]
;B[jp]C[Now Black gets an excellent counter-extension.];W[in]

(;B[jn]C[Hm... Black really has nothing to gain in the center by playing this... letting White play at L6 is no big deal. Making a framework at M16, attacking at K18, G17, or H17, or attatching at H3 seem better to me. Since Black seems focused on taking territory, I think I'll suggest H3. See the variation off the previous move.]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[ne]C[White can leave the Q14 play as a kikashi (forcing move) and play something else. On top of this, O15 is not my favorite way to aid the Q14 stone. N16 would be good.

Because of Black's move at K6, White has to prevent his lower left moyo from being squashed. A move at K7 is all but essential.]
;B[oh]C[I'd worry about the corners and sides before preventing the formation of a moyo in the center. This move also allows the double peep tesuji at Q13. This would be a better move a little later in the game.]
;W[qq]C[The following commentary is based upon what I looked up in Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, a free sgf of hundreds of joseki and commentary on them. I suggest that you go to http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm and download it.

I don't want to seem like I'm picking on either player, but this move is horrible. It should not succeed. The only reason it can succeed in this situation is because of the White stone at R7. However, any sequence that leads to life in the corner leads to danger on the right side, and Black will use that to make up for his lost points elsewhere. See the variation on White P2 coming up.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq]
(;W[or]C[This move should not work. See the variation.]
(;B[nr]C[This move gives White a prayer.];W[rp];B[pr]C[... and this move lets White off the hook.]
;W[qr];B[os]C[At this point, Black can salvage this position by playing at S5.]
;W[qo];B[po];W[qn]C[As is the result of tricky plays like White R3, one player wins big and the other is doomed to a poor outcome. Tough luck, Black.

If what I've said seems very harsh, realize that I originally thought White R3 should work perfectly, and Black should have connected Q3 and forced White where he wanted to go. Otherwise, I would have tried exactly what you did and met the same results.]
;B[im]C[With Black's weight on the bottom, I feel that the H3-G3 exchange mentioned earlier is imperative. Otherwise, Black gets nothing from this. I also dislike this move for hurting the possibility of E7.]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[gm];B[hq];W[gq];B[hr];W[gr];B[ip];W[gc]C[White must defend his lower position at B8. The variation on Black's play is just too terrible to allow.]

(;B[cd]C[See the variation for a crushing response to G17.]
;W[cc];B[ce];W[de];B[df];W[ef];B[eg];W[ff];B[fg]C[Black's group is fine. He should exchange B8 for C6, then attack at M16.]
;W[mc]C[Good call, White. You can do little with the center, so play where you can gain.]
;B[gf];W[ge]
(;B[hf]C[Too passive. See the variation for some fun moves.]
;W[he];B[cl]C[Good idea... however, I prefer the destruction wreaked by B8 a lot more.]
;W[cm];B[bl];W[bm]C[There is only one more move that Black can play against White's corner. Now is not the best time to play it, but I'll show it now while we're here anyway. See the variation on Black's next move.]

(;B[dk]C[I'd play G8... it's bigger, badder, and definitely sente.]
;W[el];B[ek];W[gk];B[ho]C[The chance is gone. >___<

Playing here is still a bit too small. It's not quite the endgame yet, so play P7.]
;W[go];B[gp];W[fp];B[io];W[gn];B[om];W[pn];B[on];W[jj]C[This move does not serve any other purpose than being a ladder breaker. If White wants to prevent a Black moyo in the center, he should play O10 (which simultaneously defends his right group). He could also play G11, which is fun, but not as big.]
;B[gj];W[hk];B[hj];W[ik];B[ii];W[if];B[ig];W[hg];B[gg];W[jg]
;B[ih];W[jh]C[White cannot gain in the center, and neither can Black. This move enables Black to gain in the center. White should have connected with M13. (The shichou on the White K13 stone fails.]
;B[jf];W[ie];B[kf];W[mg];B[lg];W[mh]C[This move should be at K11. Black's center stones will have to wriggle to escape.]
;B[ji];W[ol]C[White, why did you fight in the center if you were going to abandon the stones like this? You need to play L12.]
;B[ki];W[nl];B[nm]C[This move is slow and inefficient. It forms the most hated of shapes: the empty triangle. The proper move is at N7.]
;W[mm];B[mn];W[lm];B[ln];W[jm];B[km];W[jl]MA[bc][nb][ri]C[This is the last move of the middle game. I'll evaluate the position:

BLACK:  75 moku
Left group: 30 moku
Bottom group: 25 moku
Upper right group: 20 moku

WHITE:  85.5 moku
Upper group: 35 moku
Bottom group: 35 moku
Right group: 15 moku
Komi:  0.5 moku

White is safely ahead! So this move is too small (7 points gote). White should instead play a large endgame move. Several are marked on the board with X's.

Even though this B17 is not exactly sente, it is the biggest move on the board I can see. Black will follow by taking O18 and S11, but White will be set to win.

Unless I say otherwise, assume I wanted to say that a bigger endgame move should be played, but didn't feel like typing it :P]
;B[kl];W[mk];B[ll];W[ml];B[kj];W[lh]C[This move and its response are big.]
;B[kh];W[lf];B[kg];W[le];B[mb]C[This is a mistake. White can and should cut at O18. See the variation.]

(;W[lb];B[nb];W[nd];B[gs]C[This is sente, and big endgame. Good job, Black.]
;W[fs];B[fr]C[This is a mistake. I know you decided with your opponent to fight a ko here, but you should connect at H1.]
;W[hs];B[is];W[hp];B[gs];W[es];B[gp];W[fq];B[er];W[hs];B[il]
;W[hl];B[gs];W[oo];B[op];W[hs];B[ir];W[gs];B[ee]
(;W[ed]C[This move gave up two stones that did not have to be sacrificed. See the variation.]
;B[fe];W[fd];B[la];W[kb];B[rj]C[Again, White can cut at S11 and kill Black.]

;B[rg];W[pe]C[Correct];B[pd];W[qe];B[re];W[nh]C[Next, I would play A8. This move enables to take a point in gote later.]
;B[oi];W[al];B[bk];W[ak]C[I would play A17 and take two points in reverse sente.]

;B[sk];W[sl];B[gp];W[ns];B[ms];W[hp];B[qk];W[ql];B[gp];W[ff]
;B[ef];W[hp]C[In the end, White wins by 8.5 moku... close to my 10.5 moku estimate at the end of the middle game.

(Actually, if Black plays P15, White wins by only 7.5 moku. This fact was shared with me by a friend)

Overall, this was a good game for you to play. You explored tricky situations and played a fun game. I hope you learn something from this review... it'll make your games against each other, or serious games against other people as strong as you, a lot more more fun.

Feel free to E-mail any questions, comments, or threats to me. Just leave my mother out of it.

(;B[hq];W[gq];B[iq]C[White will probably defend his two stones somehow, with something like F4, G4, or G2. Note that this exchange has not strengthened White's moyo (framework) much... Black can inavde at B8, B7 (a really interesting move that I will not promise will definitely work), or E7. There are probably some other ones.

Choosing to not defend those stones is all right. Some other ideas are N17 to increase White's upper moyo, B8 to attack Black's left formation and make territory, D17 to strengthen White's upper moyo, S5 to strengthen White's group on the right, or Q14 to reduce Black's upper group. Be warned, though, that Black's cut at G4 will be devastating if White does not respond to save the G3 stone.
