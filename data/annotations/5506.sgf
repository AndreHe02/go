RU[Japanese]

C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  It seems that no matter what I try, I fall badly behind early on, and have to try to fight to catch up.

---

rcarn:  My pleasure.  Hope my review ends up being helpful!]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[po]C[r:  This is a bit premature for W.  Normally, B is inviting an invasion here when he plays the Chinese openingsince it will give him a good target for attack.  Generally when your opponent comes in here, I think the kick is a common play to help prevent your opponent from making a comfortable base.  Your response is playable, but a little less severe.]

(;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[ql]C[r:  This is not a good play by W.  Your responses were fine, and overall, this is a nice outcome for B.]
;B[pk];W[om];B[qg]C[Ted: I wasn't certain whether I should play on the right side, or at the bottom.  I was afraid that one of my two groups was going to end up weak.

---

r:  This is fine.  It helps support your corner and is a perfect extension from your two stone wall.  The bottom right is strong now since it has some eyespace in the corner and access to the middle, so adding another stone there would be too slow right now.]
;W[eq];B[cj]C[Ted: I was worried about my group in the bottom right becoming weak, but at the same time, I didn't want White to get good shape on the left side.  I thought allowing that would be worse for me than if I got a weak group at the bottom.

---

r:  This is good thinking on your part.  No matter which side W approaches from, you have a comfortable two space extension on the other side, and it prevents W from taking full advantage of extending from his shimari.]

(;W[cg];B[cm]C[r:  This is a great outcome for B.];W[lq]C[Ted: Now I'm in trouble; I'm going to get a weak group in the bottom right.

---

r:  This is actually overplay by W.  A move at P2 is immediate life for B, though that's almost certainly more defensive than you need to be right now.  He has left some big weak spots in his formation on the lower side that you can either exploit now or later.  You could also consider tenuki.]

(;B[nn]C[Ted: The point here was to run out toward the center, while at the same time limit White on the side.

---

r:  This is fine too, though probably a little on the defensive side.]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[mm];B[ln];W[lm];B[jn]TR[lq]C[Ted: During this exchange I thought I was putting pressure on the White stone at M3, but that's not what actually happened.]
;W[jp]TR[gp][hp][gq][hq]C[r:  You actually have put some pressure on W here.  A black play at one of the triangled spots later would leave K4/M3 looking a bit weak.]
;B[km];W[pl]C[r:  This ended up a bit better for W than it should have.  Even if W doesn't get the hane at the head of two here, the P7 wall will help limit black's expansion in the top corner.]

(;B[rk]
(;W[rl];B[jc]C[Ted: I thought all my groups were safe for the time being, so I decided to play what looked like the biggest point left on the board.]
;W[hc];B[je];W[ok]C[r:  Hane at the head of 3 is not as painful as 2, but it still hurts.  P10 is pretty much mandatory here.]

(;B[qi];W[pb]LB[oc:A][qc:B]C[Ted: I didn't see this move coming, and I didn't have any idea how to respond.

---

r:  This is sort of a probing move.  The most obvious options I can see are B to block the corner or A to force him to live small in the corner.]
;B[qc]
(;W[qb];B[rb];W[nc]
(;B[mb]C[r:  Be careful with moves like this.  If it turns out you can't kill him here, this just forces him to head out into the middle, where he'll ruin your territory.  Oftentimes, just sealing your opponent in and making him live small is enough in situations like this.]
;W[pc];B[rd];W[mc];B[lb];W[od];B[pe];W[oe];B[of];W[nf];B[og]
;W[ph]C[Ted: Another move I didn't see coming.

---

r:  This is too aggressive.  P12 seems sufficient for B.

Also, go back to 43 again.  See how that white group up top has gotten out and is now hurting you?]

(;B[qh];W[ng];B[oh];W[kf];B[jf];W[kg];B[ke]C[r:  This move doesn't do too much for B, and W can probably ignore it.  Now that W is out, that top B group is starting to look weak, so defense is probably in order.]

(;W[le];B[fc]C[Ted: I figured that if White could attack me and split my groups, I could do the same.

Besides, I felt as though I *had* to attack.  I've already got two weak groups as it is, and have to do something to weaken one of White's groups.  I've got a weak group in the bottom right, and on at the top; this is the only weakness of White's that I could find.

---

r:  I think you're tending to feel weaker than you actually are.  Even if you assume that you only have one eye in the lower right corner, that group has easy access to the middle and strong shape.  Also, if you have two weak groups on the board, your #1 priority should be to strengthen them and do everything you can to avoid letting your opponent play some sort of splitting attack that damages both groups at once.  If you try to attack with two weak groups on the board, it's likely to end in disaster, since many invasions result in a weak group as well.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[gc];B[ed];W[hd]C[r:  Big mistake by W, the ponnuki B gets here will be very painful.]
;B[fe];W[he]C[r:  White is in big trouble here.  That H17 group is hurting right now.  If it can't get access to the middle, it will almost certainly die since the two groups surrounding it have a probably eye.]

(;B[fb]C[r:  This is a bit easy on W.  He has no chance for a base on the edge anyway.  See the variation where white tries to live on the top.]
;W[hg];B[nb]C[Ted: I saw with horror that the result of my attacking White was only to make my weak group at the top weaker.  I didn't like this move, but I have to get two eyes for my group.

---

r:  Another thing to keep in mind is that if your "weak" group is stronger than a group it can attack (e.g. one eye vs. no eye), it is not as weak as it might seem.  Don't be afraid of capturing races when you're the one who will be ahead!]
;W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf]
(;B[dg];W[dh]C[r:  This gives white another hane at the head of 3 opportunity.  Try to make lighter, more flexible shapes like B79 in the variation.]
;B[eh];W[di];B[ei];W[dj]C[r:  There is a go proverb that says, "Two brothers should not fight over the same road."  As you point out, the moves you made to help the top have now hurt the side.  Though getting safe is important, try not to do it at the expense of other groups.]
;B[dk]C[Ted: Now it's the turn of my group on the side to be made weak.]
;W[ej];B[gi];W[ff];B[ef];W[jg];B[gf];W[hf]
(;B[ge]C[r:  Too defensive.  The double atari there wouldn't really matter anyway.]
;W[ek];B[dl];W[gh];B[fg];W[hi];B[fh];W[fl];B[ob];W[oc];B[ci]
;W[ch];B[bo]C[r:  Not my favorite move.  Hold back to B6 if you want to defend the edge, since wB4 is no good for you.]
;W[nr]C[Ted: I hadn't played over here before, because the last time I had a group like this and spent a defensive move on something like O2, I was severely criticized and told I was falling behind because I played moves that earned me a few points while allowing my opponent to make a lot more territory elsewhere.

But if I don't play such moves, the result is that I get weak groups.

I had a feeling the game was already beyond saving, but I'm so bad at figuring out how far ahead or behind I am that I played on.

---

r:  W did make a lot of profit from his attacks, so the game isn't looking great for you.  You were correct not to play here earlier though; at this point, P3 is enough to live with all your stones, though you'll give up some territory.  P2 looks fine still too.]

(;B[oq];W[gj]LB[nh:C][kl:B][er:A]C[r:  Too early to worry about this.  A capture here is 2 points gote for white.  You still may be able to make something happen on the bottom if you play lightly and sacrifice (maybe a funky-looking probing play like A), or you can certainly reduce the center with B or C.]

(;B[rj]C[r:  Too passive, you can just block at T10.  It's gote for B either way.]
;W[sn]C[r:  This looks wrong for W.]
(;B[sq];W[ro];B[sp];W[ho]C[r:  This move pretty much seals the deal for W.]

;W[ij]C[r:  W should not ignore B169.  H18 is quite big for both sides now.]

;B[ha];W[ga];B[ia];W[gb];B[fa]LB[ra:A][mh:B][em:C][io:E][jo:D]
C[r:  1 point gote.  There's much bigger endgame points out there (I marked a few examples).  Even though the game is all but over, resist following your opponent's moves around the board.]
;W[oa];B[na];W[pa]
(;B[ka]C[Ted: At the time, I couldn't tell whether or not I needed to play this.  The thing is that White has the threat of playing at L19 and following it up with J17.

I didn't realize just how weak this group was.

---

r:  Yes, it appears you need to add a move here.  As you said, wL19 would kill (see variations).]

---

r:  Overall, you didn't do badly, but you let your opponent get away with a lot of overplay because you perceived your groups as being weaker than they were.
