C[michiel [13k\]: hi

[Agi\] Hi, I'm Aginyan on KGS and I'll be reviewing this game. I'll be tagging all my comments so that they're easier to follow amongst the other comments in the game.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[cp];B[eo]LB[ec:B][dm:C][ep:A][eq:D]C[[Agi\] This is a non-standard approach. There isn't much reason to avoid playing in the more traditional positions. It is overly high relative to the bottom, and white will have no problem settling there. 

If black absolutely  wanted something facing the top, point A is probably the way to go, and then fighting if white decides to deny black from getting it.. Followed by B, and perhaps something non-standard like C. But variations at A and D could get black what he wanted too.]
;W[eq]C[[Agi\] And white takes the normal point.];B[cn]LB[nd:C]
[dn:B][do:A]C[[Agi\] This move is really thin. White can foricbly cut black with A if he wanted, or wait to use B in a ladder in conjunction w/ something near C]
;W[ec]LB[nd:C][dn:B][gp:A]C[[Agi\] white would really like to have something around A, letting black seal off the corner with a play in that area would be somewhat painful.]
;B[db]LB[gc:B][df:A]C[[Agi\] This just feels very defensive. Black has stones in both corners, and should be thinking about either working with the left with something near A, or working with the right with a pincer.]
;W[eb];B[ee]LB[dd:B][dn:A]C[[Agi\] Black is somewhat too fond of knight's moves... While they're relatively safe from being cut for the moment, the cutting points around A and B will be a burden later when fighting breaks out.]
;W[id]LB[gc:A][kc:B]C[[Agi\] this is too far and too high... A black play at A or B wold deeply unsettle white's group]
;B[mc]LB[kc:A]C[[Agi\] This is probably fine. Playing at A is also a possibility, but if a running fight breaks out, the left is really thin to be much help in attacking.]
;W[kc]
(;B[lb]C[[Agi\] this move is small and forces white to practically live. See variations for alternate moves]
;W[kb];B[qf];W[qh]LB[oh:B][qj:A][qm:C]C[Mongoose11 [14k\]: hey

[Agi\] White played too close to strong black stones, Black should be taking advantage of it, even if it's just a simple sequence like black A, white B, black C.]
;B[op];W[mq];B[on];W[pn];B[lp]C[[Agi\] Ignoring a white attachment is odd.]
(;W[lq];B[kp];W[hp]LB[gp:C][hq:B][jq:A]C[[Agi\] this is too far from supporting stones, and leaves holes for black to press. A, B, C all would have been better.]
;B[ek]TR[qj][pm][fq][qq]C[[Agi\] A rather vague move trying to take the left side. Instead, there's at least a few points that look interesting and are more urgent for both players]
(;W[cg]TR[cf]C[[Agi\] normally to threaten the cut, white would play at the marked point]
;B[ci];W[eg];B[ei];W[ge]TR[id]C[[Agi\] This move was a direct result of the wide move made much earlier. White now has to fix the top group, when he should be concentrating on running with the left side.]
;B[ff];W[fg];B[gf];W[fe];B[cf]C[[Agi\] there is absolutely no reason to allow white to cut here]
;W[ef]LB[ee:A][gf:B]C[[Agi\] With this cut, White's invasion is a success.

Either white will capture A. Or white will capture/chase B and get to safety]
(;B[bg]C[[Agi\] In light of how white is safe for the moment, this would be the way to connect the black groups]
;W[de];B[dg]TR[ce][ch]C[This move was a mistake. I should have played at one of the triangles in stead.]
;W[ce];B[bf]TR[be]C[Still a chance to connect the two grouos at the triangle.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[ae]
(;B[bb]TR[dc]C[Is this the best way to try to make life? Investigate.

[Agi\] After A15, both look dead];W[dc];B[cb]TR[cc]C[[Agi\] This is dead if white pokes further. A play at C17 would have saved the black group, see variations]
(;W[hg];B[ig]LB[gi:A][oj:C][io:B]TR[ik]SQ[qj][ql][pm][qq]C[A good move? It was the beginning of what eventually became a sizeable chunk of territory, which I traded away for territory near the triangle.

[Agi\] All this move really does is threaten to rescue the two black stones in the net and force white to respond.  There's nothing around the triangle that looks like potential territory at this point. White has 3 doors into the area, and it will take at least 4-6 black moves to secure that space.

The square areas are much more interesting to look at.];W[if]
;B[jg];W[ok]TR[pm]C[[Agi\] White is playing too high. The triangle marked point is too big a weakness to do anything on the 5th line.]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[po];W[qn];B[pl];W[qk];B[pk];W[pj]C[[Agi\] White panicked after seeing P9 go entirely to waste]
;B[ql];W[rk]LB[rl:A]C[[Agi\] Not a happy turn of events for white. Playing the squeeze at A also leads to very complicated lines where it is not clear if white will do well.]
;B[rl];W[qo]C[I'm pleased with this attack. Is it a good idea? It seems like it. Maybe a little small, but it gave me attacks later, and reduced territory.

[Agi\] Small? It split a white group into, took away most of white's potential for territory on the side, and weakens the corner. It is many things, but not small.]
;B[om];W[cc]TR[aa]C[This move makes me think I could probably have lived if I'd made the next move in the area, either there or at the triangle.

[Agi\] It's dead now, see previous variations];B[bc];W[ad];B[fq]
TR[hp]C[I'm giving up as dead at this point. More territory reduction here, and hopefully either cut the triangle stone or build a wall above it.]
;W[fp];B[ep]C[Not exactly as planned, clearly.

[Agi\] When you play that attachment, this should be the first response you consider. It is a move you use to cut the whote stone off from the corner.]
;W[dq];B[gp]C[Cut?];W[fo]
(;B[hq]TR[fo][fp][hp]C[Turn a bad situation around, and try to build territory underneath. Potentially sacrifice territory above. (I only end up losing five or ten points to the attack from the triangled stones.)

[Agi\] See variation];W[go]LB[kp:A]TR[gp]SQ[fq]C[Maybe protecting the triangle in stead of the square would have been better.

[Agi\] Black can only play this way because black can connect to A]
(;B[ho]C[[Agi\] black decides to self-destruct. See variations]
;W[gq];B[ip];W[gp];B[hn];W[iq];B[jq];W[hr];B[ir]LB[oq:A]TR[ip]
[kp][jq][kr]SQ[hj][mj][mk][hn][ho]C[I like how this turns out - Moyo starts at squares, invasion from triangles eventually very successful.

[Agi\] There's not much of any moyo in the center. White can easily reducte it by 1/3rd to 1/2 with a single move at the squares. Black's real profit is with a play at A]
;W[hq]LB[qc:C][ni:B][oq:A]TR[fo][go][fp][gp][hp][gq][iq][hr]
C[Heh. I gave him awful shape. Not in the most productive way, but still.

[Agi\] Filling this ko amounts to a pass for white. White should seriously be considering a play at A to connect/secure the corner

Or something around B to help the right group.

 If white isn't afraid of playing Ko and is confident in the health of B, C is probably also an option to consider.]
;B[kr]LB[oq:A]C[[Agi\] A pass on black's part. White's stones can't reconnect from that side regardless. J2 is not worth enough points to save right now.]
;W[oq]C[[Agi\] Good, white connected. This alone is easily swung the balance of points by 30+]
(;B[nk]TR[ni][mk][nl]C[This is much too aggressive. Any of the three triangles would have been better.]
;W[nj]SQ[pf][og][pg][nh][oh][ni][nk]C[This wall of black stones did not appear as anticipated.

[Agi\] I am unable to imagine a white response that would give black the opportunity to build a wall. It's directly in white's escape path.

Secondly, there seems to be little point in building a wall there. It faces live white stones]
;B[mk];W[gi];B[hb]SQ[kd]C[Anticipating my invasion at the square. Waste of sente, in hindsight - he never made the ladder it was supposed to break.

[Agi\] It's not an invasion if you don't go Into any area. the square is just an attachment.]
;W[gc]LB[ke:A]C[[Agu\] White didn't need to respond there. Something around A would have sufficed, and would have helped weaken black's center]
;B[kd]
(;W[jd]SQ[ld]C[It did keep him from playing at the square, though.

[Agi\] He could have if he felt behind and needed a fight. See variation]
;B[ke];W[og];B[hh];W[gh]LB[gi:B][nj:A]SQ[je][jf][ig][jg][hh]
[ih][hi]C[One thing I've learned from watching professional games, commented - even if stones are dead, use them. Make moves that could theoretically rescue them if ignored. That's how I built this wall.

[Agi\] While forcing your opponent to eat dead stones is important. Black's wall is facing white's live group at A, and has a live group sticking out of it at B. So it has very little value. Walls are for attacking and building territory from the attack. When they face live groups, they're not worth very much.]
;B[hi];W[mj];B[lj]CR[mg]TR[jl][ml][jn][mn]SQ[nh][oh][ph][ni]
[oi][pi]C[I still feel I should have been able to reduce the squared territory somehow, without sacrificing my triangled territory. Maybe a play at the circle in stead of where I did?

[Agi\] You marked 6 points for white. At this stage of the game, white should be thinking about those points as "territory" White has only 1 goal here, reduce the large black center and left side while staying alive]
;W[lh]LB[hj:A][lk:B]C[[Agi\] White didn't keep up the pressure. points A and B both take advantage of black's weak shapes in the area to help in reducing.]
;B[gj];W[np];B[jf]LB[lk:A][mo:B]C[Using the dead stones, as mentioned. Somehow I feel better about him playing where I wanted to if I can do something useful before responding to it.

[Agi\] Those stones aren't critical for white's survival in the area. White should have ignored this and played something like A or B and put up a tougher fight]
;W[ie];B[no];W[mp];B[mo];W[pp];B[oo]C[Playing first in this area was worth quite a few points. How do you count that?

[Agi\] like you would count any endgame position, figure out the point swing]
;W[io]
(;B[jp]CR[gm]SQ[jm][km][jn][kn][jo][ko][kp][jq][kq][kr]C[Big decision here, to cut that one rather than absorb it. Seems obvious in hindsight, but I did a lot of trying-out of moves. The alternative was at the circle, to get the territory above it, sacrificing the squares.
Reviewing helps!

[Agi\] Playing at the circled point instead is self destructive. See variation]
;W[in];B[hm];W[im];B[il]SQ[fn]C[The square is much better. His three stones are already dead.]
;W[lk]C[This scared me a lot.];B[kj]SQ[pk][pl][ql][rl][om][pm]
[on][mo][no][oo][po][op]C[Again, I decide to be bold, cut off escape, and be really careful to protect the squares.]
;W[ll];B[ol];W[oj];B[mm]C[Making some eyespace

[Agi\] black's eyes are under white's stones. So long as white doesn't suddenly come back to life, making eyes is unncessary.]
;W[ml];B[nl];W[lm];B[ln];W[nn];B[km];W[li];B[nf]TR[mh]SQ[km]
C[We've both realized it's dead, I think. Honestly, I think it was before the square was played. Should have taken the triangle in stead.

[Agi\] black at the triangle would just get cut off and swallowed by white]
;W[ng];B[of]C[This felt much too passive to me at the time. I was thicker than he was, but the line was drawn even.]
;W[gm];B[fn];W[hl]TR[gn]C[He really should have played at the triangle. I got lucky here.]
;B[gn];W[jl];B[ik];W[en];B[fm]
(;W[do]LB[em:A]TR[cn][eo][ep]C[[Agi\] White is not using the dead stones to the fullest extent. See variation 

The marked black stones are weak and far from supporting black stones. White should be looking to exploit these]
;B[em];W[dn];B[dm]TR[ik]C[Playing first in this area would have helped a lot. Could I still have killed if I'd ommitted the triangle stone to open the area earlier?


[Agi\] With proper play, it might not have mattered, but making a mistake could possibly let white live. There isn't a good reason to omit the triangle stone.

No further comments until the summary at the very end.];W[kl]
;B[jk]C[Should have been ignored. I don't stop him making the eye, and I know I can stop him making a second or escaping.]
;W[kn];B[kk];W[jm];B[jo]TR[ko]C[I got lucky here - in game, I thought the triangles were miai for a kill, but made a 'bad' decision to prove the stones were already dead.]

Mongoose11 [14k\]: aye, thanks. was a good game.
michiel [13k\]: that was fun

[Agi\] First,white played some loose moves early on that took precious extra moves to repair later in the game. This got in the way when fights broke out nearby.

White also did not take advantage of dead stones and black's weak shape in some critical instanes that were worth many points.

Black's greatest issue, as evidenced in both the self-review comments and moves played on the board, is being trouble honing in on what can be attacked for profit, and trouble evaluating the value of walls that are facing strong enemy groups.

Instead of going after groups on the sides that could be attacked for profit in 1 move (and killed in 3-4) Black tries to secure center territory that requires 5-6 moves to complete (and could be severely reduced in 1-2 moves).

It would do to remember that each move should do at least 1 job well when it goes onto the board. Doing 1 thing well is oftentimes worth more than doing 2 things badly. (Bad moves require fixing later on)

Stronger players try to make each move do many things at once, but good moves start by doing 1 thing very well. Everything else is bonus.]
