C[Hello,

I will be reviewing your game.  My comments will appear with the tag [Cyn\].  Be sure to keep playing more, and have fun!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc]
(;B[id]LB[ic:A][kc:B]C[[Cyn\] This is OK, but the point at A might be better.  Your move leaves weaknesses around B that you need to be aware of if you play this move.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qi]C[[Cyn\] Your opponent ignored a contact move!]

(;B[qm]C[[Cyn\] You should hurt the stone your opponent neglected.]
;W[fq]
(;B[dk]C[[Cyn\]  This move is high and floating.]
(;W[lq];B[ch]LB[cf:B][dk:A]C[[Cyn\]  Good, you settle down A, and put pressure on the B group.]
;W[cm]
(;B[eg]LB[dd:B][ch:A]C[[Cyn\] Good, the idea of surrounding B while strengthening A is a nice idea.]
;W[iq]
(;B[cq]LB[dd:A][qf:B]C[[Cyn\] This might be too early.  You can continue to pressure A, or you could hurt the B stone in the top left.]
;W[cp]
(;B[dq];W[eq]
(;B[er];W[fr];B[es];W[fs];B[cs];W[dr];B[ds];W[bq];B[bf];W[be]
;B[bg];W[bk]LB[cb:A]C[[Cyn\] Maybe you can play A to keep pressuring the corner]
;B[bj];W[ck];B[cj]TR[bj][dk]C[[Cyn\] This was a bad exchange for white. It's like you hane at the head of 2.]
;W[oq];B[pq]C[[Cyn\] This is another bad exchange for white]
;W[im];B[ih]LB[cb:B][qf:A][oq:C]C[[Cyn\] I dont like this move.  You have unanswered contact moves at A and C that could be followed up.  The move at B also puts that group under a lot of stress.]
;W[nc]LB[nc:A][qf:B]C[[Cyn\] Your opponent is kind enough to make another weak group in this area.  You should be very happy.]

(;B[nd];W[kc]LB[qc:A]C[[Cyn\] Maybe white should have taken the corner here]

(;B[jc];W[kb]
(;B[jb]C[[Cyn\] I dont like this move.  Let him live small on the edge with 2 points and profit elsewhere.]
;W[ke];B[jf];W[kf];B[if]LB[kc:1][qf:2]TR[jb][jc][id][jf]C[[Cyn\] What did these moves gain you? You should try and use moves against 1 that threaten 2 or vice versa]
;W[qc]LB[if:1]TR[nd][pd][pf]C[[Cyn\] White will get to connect to one of his stones, black is starting to look dangerous because the moves around 1 are not helping much in this area.]

;B[ph];W[qh];B[pi];W[pe];B[of];W[oe];B[od];W[fe];B[gd];W[fd]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[ge]LB[cb:A]C[[Cyn\] This move does very little.  The point A at least reduces the eye space of white a bit more.]
;W[cb];B[da]C[[Cyn\] This drop down is not so great, it leaves free follow ups for white as you find out]
;W[ca];B[fb];W[ff];B[fg];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf];B[he]LB[mp:A]C[[Cyn\] You are following your opponent around here.  Look around for bigger moves.  Maybe something around the bottom area?]
;W[kk]
(;B[lj]LB[nh:A]C[[Cyn\] What does this move do for you? You maybe make a few points around A?]
;W[kj];B[ki];W[ji];B[kh];W[jh];B[ii];W[ij];B[jg];W[jj];B[hj]
LB[fi:A][ho:B]C[[Cyn\] As you push on this white group, you only gain a little around A, but he gains a lot around B]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[gj];B[hi];W[fi];B[gi];W[fj];B[hl];W[il];B[ik]
;W[jl]
(;B[ml]LB[gn:A]C[[Cyn\] Maybe jumping in over here is a better idea]
;W[fm];B[fk];W[el];B[ek];W[dl];B[gm];W[gn];B[fl];W[fn];B[hm]
;W[hn];B[mo];W[lo];B[mp];W[lp];B[ln];W[kn];B[lm];W[km];B[qj]
;W[lk];B[mj];W[mk];B[nk];W[li];B[mi];W[lh];B[kg];W[nl];B[ok]
;W[nm]C[[Cyn\] Even by here the sealed off white area is too big.  I hope some of my comments were helpful! Good luck
