C[Hello,

I lost this game on time, but this is not important.

The point is : at move 80, white made a mistake
that gave me the fourth corner.

Despite a clear lead in the sure territory, I could not prevent White from catching up in the centre.

What I would like to know is :

1) is there any early choice in the fuseki that you would point as a clear arbitrage mistake.
An other way to put up the question : Should I have modified my strategy in the fuseki, because it would end up being wrong ?

2) at move 87 (or around), how could I have played to prevent white from catching up ?]

;B[fc];W[fe];B[cc]MA[db]C[may be D18 was better here.
D14 might have been treated as a kikashi.

I would still have several options, I think.

Christian: Well, I would not critizise this move but your next. Now D17 and C16 are miai.]
;W[dc]
(;B[eb]C[Christian: The exchange B E18 W D18 is a very bad aji keshi. If you just play C16, you can cut if white hanes at C15. After your exchange, this doesn't work anymore. Your group at the top is already alive, so you must not be afraid.]
;W[db]
(;B[cd]C[Christian: Another bad move. After your exchange, you have no answer when white hanes - C15 B15 is unbearable! Your stone D14 is too important - after C15 B15 it looks like a wasted move. If you don't want to abandon C17, you should play a light move - B15.]

;B[bg];W[ch];B[ne];W[oe]
(;B[pe]C[Christian: Why not P14?]
(;W[od]C[Christian: The same question for white: Why not P14? This is bad shape and too submissive.
P14 would give white an easy game.];B[ng];W[of];B[og];W[pg]
C[Christian: This cut looks unreasonable and should be a losing move.]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[rg]MA[ng]C[So far, I'm ok.
B has 35 point, and white almost none.

However, I don't know how to count the white influence, since it is impaired (I think it is ...) by the marked stones

Christian: S13 looks a bit strange - I would not like Q16 to be sente (implying you have to count Q17 as being captured). Doesn't R14 capture the two stones, too?

It is hard to calculate the value of white's thickness in units of territory, but I would assume that white gets at least 10-15 points around D14.

But yes, black is clearly ahead after white played Q13.];W[bh]
C[Christian: Big.];B[cb];W[ca];B[ba];W[da];B[ab];W[mk]C[were the marked spot no bigger ?

Christian: I'm sorry - I don't see your mark in the sgf file. But I agree this is a strange move. If I was white, I would play L3.]
;B[kf]C[Christian: Dangerous.];W[lf];B[nf]TR[rg]C[Christian: Is this really sente? White should just play M13 to build an impressive moyo.  S13 was a bad move!]

(;W[oh]C[Christian: Well, white doesn't see how to use the aji ... 
Minus 10 points in gote.];B[qf];W[nd];B[fp]C[Christian: I would play M13 a tempo]

C[this was a bad mistake from W.
At this stage, I don't see how W is going to catch up in the game.

Black is going to have the four corners, plus the D6 stones lurking at the centre ...

Christian: Well, B4 would not work either. E3 has to be blamed, not B3.]
;B[bp];W[gp];B[co];W[fo];B[mq];W[dp];B[lg]MA[lh][dj]C[this was probably a bad move.
this is the kind of moves I make out of consistent goal, because I think the game is mine.

I did not read properly the follow ups

Now what else ?


I can think of D10, or M12

Christian: M13 looks perfectly ok. As I said before, I would have played this move a tempo instead of your kakari.]
;W[kg]
(;B[le]C[Christian: What's that? You are too concerned about single stones. White's only chance is to create a huge moyo in the center. So you must think about reducing it, not about connecting a single stone. If you look at the position, don't you see L12 is the only move???]
;W[jf];B[mf];W[kh];B[el];W[cl];B[dm];W[bm];B[gl]MA[ej]C[E10 better ?
Christian: E10 looks bigger but also leaves more bad aji - hard to say if its better.
Both moves should win the game.];W[fk]
(;B[fl]C[Christian: Too concerned about single stones. E9 is better. By sacrificing G8, you could destroy the whole moyo.]
;W[kq];B[gk];W[oq]
(;B[op]C[I did not think of 03 during the game.
Is it any better ?

Christian: I haven't seen O3 before, but it seems to be better. O4 might be the sharpest reponse, but I'm not sure if it works.]

This is a position where you have two read. You should read out the most probable attacks before you enter byoyomi.
If I'm not mistaken, this move doesn't work at all.]

this does not seem *possible*.
However, most of my games reflect the same pattern : I can make a clear lead in the fuseki, and I lose all the lead in the chuban.

This case is the worst I ever made.

Can you make out a possible answer to the question I raise in the beginning ?]
