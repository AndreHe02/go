;W[db]LB[jd:3][ce:B][ch:A][ck:1][jq:2]C[There are three areas of the board that you can play in. 1 is definitely the smallest. The gap between A and B is very safe, and extending into the area around one seems very small at this point in the game.

2 is a very nice area indeed, but you must first look at area 3. White already has a wall, so now you need to make it useless. If you play too close to the wall, you will be pincered, and have a hard fight. Play too far away, and white will get a nice extension.]

(;B[dg]SQ[kc][kd]C[The idea of this play was to prevent white from building up a wall and containing my group to a very small space. I think perhaps there was a better way to achieve these goals, or just somewhere better to play at this point.

This is a little over concentrated I think. Instead of preventing a wall, I would make the wall that white already has turn into a useless wall.]

EtienneG [12k\]: that was a very pacific game
dbstraight [12k\]: aside from my ill-conceived attack at O9 or so
dbstraight [12k\]: which just ended up putting you in better position on the center

I think I made some poor choices which ended up letting white get far too much territory in both the bottom-left and top-center. Things looked ok up until my ill-conceived attack and letting white develop the top territory. That's the point of the game where I tend to break down though. I need to learn more about containing territories and making invasions. I would love any suggestions on those topics, or of course anything else you see that I could've done better.


**** you need to work on sente and gote, that alone could have won the game for you. Aside from that, also consider how your attacks will help or hurt your opponent, and if attacking will help or hurt you.

I'll do my best to replay the game from move 120, and show you a possible endgame if you had taken sente.]
