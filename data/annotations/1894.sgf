While W can still invade your corner or your lower side.

183: the 2-2 surprised me but i saw it before in the other corner, where it surprised me as well and i acted wrongly by connecting to the border of the board

200: trying to create eyes by putting black in atari


There is a simpler way : the stones S2 S3 can't make life. See var]

T5 was enough];B[ps]C[wasted. T5 now is needed];W[qs];B[so]
C[OK];W[qo];B[rs];W[rk];B[ql];W[sr]C[214 - played on the wrong side to cut off the white stone, I guess I should have played on the left side next to the white stone to protect the upper area, now I lost the area and made a path to go through for white..



sorry, I'm not sure I understand the point ...
This is meant to be B comments ...];B[sq];W[rl];B[qm];W[pe]

300: i didnt saw a better way out so i was trying to create at least a seki if black connected the 3 stones

probably the best W can get];B[sh];W[tt];B[tt];W[ga]C[304: suddenly saw a play where i might have been able to get points out of the dead stones in the middle]

;B[lb];W[sf];B[ja];W[tt];B[ri]C[319 - yet another stupid move, destroyed seki.

yes];W[rg];C[As a summary :
B lost because he forgot to think that there are points on the board, particularly on the side, and he let W take advantage of this.

Besides : trying to live in the middle is a lost struggle. remember it takes 10 stones to live in the middle of the board.

Nevertheless, B played some smart moves on the upper side of the board, first by enclosing W in the upper left, then by taking a W lump on upper right.

Eventually : look at your groups, and how much territorry they make in comparison with W.  W did shut the left side very early, and B did not care to go for the right side early enough.


Hope this helps.


PS : as to the players ranking : I have no notion, sorry. If you are 26k on IGS, consider adding 3 k to your ranking for "average" rank.]
