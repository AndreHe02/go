;B[cp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[qf]LB[ep:a][nq:b]C[orionsky:
In this position, the most important area is on the bottom. W has a good approach move at a (E4), so B should either play there himself or at b (O3) to prevent W there.]
;W[nc];B[rd];W[fc]LB[qc:a][ep:b]C[orionsky:
This is not so important at the moment. W should take the corner at a (R17). This is sente against the B group there so B will defend. Afterwards W can play at the important point b (E4).]
;B[jd]C[orionsky:
This seems overly aggressive. The W group in the UL corner is not weak enough to attack, as he can settle it like it happened in the game. Afterwards W can look forward to a counterattack.

Instead, B should simply extend at a (D 14). If W defends the upper side, B gets the important move on the lower side.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[fe]C[orionsky:
This leaves the UR group unsettled. W should force once more at S 18.]
;B[gd]C[orionsky:
Very bad. If W simply connects, B only strengthened him and gains nothing (see var).]

(;W[gc]C[orionsky:
Very bad. This gives B a chance.];B[fd];W[ed];B[ec];W[ee];B[eb]
LB[hc:a]C[orionsky:
Very bad. If B wants to accomplish anything, he has to fight on with a (H17). After that, a very complicated fight starts.]
;W[hd];B[pn]C[orionsky:
A high approach move is usually not good since it foresakes the corner. Furthermore you should never play moves just to force the opponent to remove aji (the ladder) if you do not want to follow it up.]
;W[ge]LB[cd:a]C[orionsky:
B lost very much here. His former pincer stone completely lost his meaning, W has overwhelming strength and the B UL corner is not yet secure. Consider W a (C16).]
;B[md]LB[of:a][nq:b]C[orionsky:
Wrong direction. B should play around a (P14) and build strength toward the LR corner, where he already placed a stone which emphasizes strength, or he should use his extra stone and attack at b (O3). In addition to that, B create a truely weak group in the middle of W's influence.]
;W[pf];B[qe];W[pg]LB[nf:a]C[orionsky:
Maybe a (O14) could also be considered, giving a more solid connection.]
;B[nd]C[orionsky:
Now B has to defend his group which is very unprofitable for him.]
;W[od];B[mc];W[nb]LB[ob:a]C[orionsky:
W at a is usually better style.];B[qh];W[eq];B[nq];W[oo];B[de]
LB[kq:a]C[orionsky:
Big but not important at the moment. A move at a is vital for B and his success in the LR corner.]
;W[kq]LB[lq:a]C[orionsky:
Play at a (M3) if you want to attack.];B[pq];W[qp]LB[qq:a]C[orionsky:
W at a (R3) is a MUST. It steals B eyespace.];B[op];W[np];B[oq]
;W[po];B[ql]C[orionsky:
Not important. B should rather secure his corner group.];W[qq]
C[orionsky:
Important.];B[lq]C[orionsky:
This move shows that W's attacking move was one space too far away. Attack severely!]
;W[mp]LB[kp:a]C[orionsky:
The corner group is alive so W should rather play on the outside at a (L4).]
;B[lp];W[lo];B[ko]C[orionsky:
Very courageous. Simply at a (L4) seems ok.];W[mq];B[mo];W[ln]
;B[mr];W[no];B[kr];W[kp];B[lr];W[jq]C[Bad shape cost me later!

orionsky:
a (J3) seems better.];B[qr];W[jr];B[mn]C[orionsky:
Bad timing. B should leave this aji for later.];W[om];B[rq]
C[orionsky:
Simply extending is better since it leaves no sente move for W.]
;W[rp]C[orionsky:
Erasing the aji at a (N7) is much more important. The bottom is small and W has the chance to complete his thickness.]
;B[gp]LB[eo:a]C[orionsky:
If W had fixed his weakness on the lower side, he could now better fight back with a (E5). Though this is still possible (and better) it seems a bit more risky now.]
;W[io];B[kn]LB[ep:a]C[orionsky:
Aji keshi. B should content himself with connecting at a (E4). W still has to fix his weakness some time.]
;W[lm];B[ip];W[km]LB[eo:a]C[orionsky:
Maybe sill a (E5).];B[ep];W[fq];B[fp];W[hr];B[ib]C[I was looking at attacking that black group for a while but never got around to it.

orionsky:
B connected on rather neutral space so this is not so bad for W.]
;W[cj];B[gq];W[gr];B[ch];W[dm];B[dq];W[qj]C[orionsky:
W needs to use his thickness to catch up with territory. An invasion at a (C14) seems bigger at this point.]
;B[rj];W[qi]LB[ri:a]C[orionsky:
As W needs territory, cutting at a (S11) seems better.];B[ri]
;W[ph];B[qg];W[qk];B[jj]C[I think black should have connected at the bottom

orionsky:
Yes. After that, W still has to defend if he wants to build a moyo in the middle. B's move is not good, it serves no clear purpose but presents an object for attacking where W could use his walls.]
;W[rk]C[With this I feel ahead with one strong group and two smaller ones that can probably survive. However black managed to invade the area on the right and I made things a little difficult. Black's style is to over play. How should I have closed out the game to win?]
;B[iq];W[jn];B[qb];W[jf]C[orionsky:
Very good.];B[pi]C[orionsky:
Reckless.];W[ng]C[orionsky:
Missed by one line. Above is much better.];B[nf]C[orionsky:
The weak spot.];W[of];B[mg];W[nh]C[orionsky:
Better one line to the left.];B[mh]C[orionsky:
Now B can effectively erase W's thickness which is his chief asset in this game.]
;W[df]C[orionsky:
Aji keshi. This makes the invasion impossible.];B[cf];W[dg]
;B[cg];W[dh];B[ir]C[orionsky:
Bad. Loses a ko threat.];W[is];B[mj]C[orionsky:
Good, the game becomes good for B.];W[ni];B[pl]C[orionsky:
Hm, does this really work? B creates a weak group which seems difficult with all the W thickness.]

;W[kh];B[jh];W[kg];B[di];W[ei];B[fm];W[kc]C[orionsky:
The B group in the middle is more important at the moment.]

Ko continues. B is better, since this is an approach ko for W.]

(;W[fd]C[orionsky:
B is essentially cut in two on the upper side and there is no chance to effectively attack W. On the contrary, B has to worry about both the corner and the group on the upper side.]
