AB[pp][dd][pd][dp]C[H: My early game is definitely the weakest aspect of my play presently, followed by telling what moves are big, versus what moves are simply weak.  This is, of course, my own assessment, and I could well be missing other glaring faults in my play.


  I think Black did really well up to a point, and won several critical battles. 

 Now that you're tactically good, maybe is a time to think about strategy of the game, especially watch for the weak groups (yours and the opponent's), how can you fix them/gain other profit in sente (several examples in this game), and, of course... 
          connections!];W[fq];B[hq]LB[dn:a]C[Normally A is more popular in handicap games, but this move is ok.]
;W[dn]
(;B[fp]LB[dj:a][eo:b]C[H: I don't know if this is a particularly good move.  It's joseki for a double-low-approach, but I'm not used to the approach at D6

M:   yes this is considered joseki, A and B are other possibilities]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[ep]C[However, here the mainline for W is C4]
;B[fo];W[eq]
(;B[do]C[your first mistake. B must play E5, rendering W play questionable]
;W[eo];B[go]LB[fn:A]C[the difference (from B E5) is dramatic!

 "A" seems better for Black.];W[fn]
(;B[gn]C[B can still fight for the corner];W[cn]C[This finishes the corner. But Black gets nice influence by forcing at F7, as a compensation.]
;B[dq]C[I don't think B can live];W[dr];B[cr];W[es];B[bp]C[nice point, but not quite enough]
;W[br];B[cs]C[H: At this point, my stones are alive.  I did, however, lose sente for the rest of the corner.  I don't immediately see the best way to have had a better outcome here.

not alive, see var]
(;W[bo];B[bq];W[cp];B[ar];W[cf]C[B can be happy with the outcome, and F7 is even more powerful now (threatening to separate W stones)]
;B[ee]C[H: At the time this felt like a big move.  Now, however, it seems weak and small.  Perhaps G17 would have been better, or a pincer at C12?

This move seems reasonable locally. However, you should take F7 now]
;W[gm]
(;B[in]C[this is a purely defensive move, but I believe F7 is still possible 

When you play on the border of two moyos, as it appears here (White on the left, Black on the right), you don't want to give in.]
;W[fm]
(;B[ci]C[this invasion looks premature. White position on the bottom is thick, so he may get advantage this way

I would prefer to reduce quietly with E13 (while building strength), or play "shape" with H7]
;W[dh]C[this looks a little risky for White: contact play like this usually makes the stone stronger...]
;B[ch];W[ef];B[dg]C[this is a gutsy play from Black!];W[cg]
;B[df];W[eg];B[de];W[di];B[cj];W[cl]C[looks like W is resigned to lose his two stones, B gets big lead]

;B[bc];W[fe];B[fd];W[hm]
(;B[kn]C[again, Black gets defensive-minded.

What is the purpose of this move? 
The B group on the bottom is secure, so you don't need this move to protect it. On the other hand, to make territory, there are many bigger moves available. This move does not even make territory as it is very high, on the 6th line. 
 ("3rd line for territory, 4th line for influence" goes the proverb)

Finally, it does not defend 100% either, as future play shows.

See var for an attack opportunity];W[hn];B[ho];W[io];B[hp];W[jn]
;B[jo];W[im]
(;B[ip]C[ you could play K4 to protect the cut];W[ko];B[jp]
;W[kp];B[kq];W[ln];B[km];W[lq];B[kr];W[lm];B[kl];W[fh]C[H: Should I have cut before W's play at F12?  It didn't feel like a very big move, but I wonder if that was correct, in hindsight.

After L6, Black's moves are pretty much forced, so no cut probably. 

However, the cut is pretty big, since it also affects a big part of the board.]

(;B[ge];W[nc]C[foolishness or desperation?]
(;B[lc];W[ne];B[nd]C[H: I know that Q14 is the standard response to this.  However, given my strength towards the left, and the openness of the side at this point, the wedge seemed a good idea.

B already has enough leverage, as you've seen. So, you can play "thickly" now without trying to overextend yourself. 

In particular, besides F10, you might want to strengthen your weak stones at center, playing M8. 

Also, this move (M8) is sente, because of the cut I discussed before.]

(;W[md]C[the other side seems better to me];B[od];W[mc];B[jc]
C[again, tell me the purpose of this move. 
How many points do you hope to gain? 

Now, compare to N15, which is likely to get you a big portion of the right side. 

Also, since you have capture at F14 pending, you are strong on top, so no need to play here... 
(regarding your overall question about direction, "Do not make territory out of thickness")]
;W[id]C[good gamesmanship, although I would not play this move. White gambles to surround the center, which is big, but is thwarted by possibility of capture at F15. However, M8 is getting bigger and bigger now.

(W feels emboldened by B retreating!)]
(;B[ic]C[yes that's the move he counted on! 

i think Black still needs to play N15. If you have an opportunity to cut, more often than not it will work :+}]
;W[hd]
(;B[gd]C[ok this is really bad: you don't need this while you still have F14. Instead, L15 neatly separates W's stones!]
;W[hc];B[hb]C[ok tell me the move for B here :+}];W[gb];B[ha]
;W[ga];B[jb];W[gc];B[fc]SQ[id][hd][hc][gc][gb][ga]C[both sides are really oblivious to how weak this W group is...]
;W[eb];B[ff];W[fg];B[dc];W[db]
(;B[cb];W[fb]SQ[if]C[W is really asking for it...]
(;B[ec]C[Black's group is not really in danger, to waste a move like that.]
;W[if]C[now W is about to connect his weak groups, and B top is in danger]

;W[co]C[this is not a good threat: it's only 6 points! B should ignore.]
;B[cq];W[pc]
(;B[lp]C[did I mention M8?

Also, N18 is huge now. Not only it's a threat (to capture 3 W stones), it totally separates W!]
;W[lo];B[pb];W[ap];B[bs];W[pc];B[me]C[still, N18 is better]
;W[pb]
(;B[nf];W[mb];B[qd]C[this might be small at the moment];W[mp]
;B[le]C[now you wish you played N18...];W[pq];B[pn]C[you cede too much this way, simpy R3 is probably better]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[op];B[po];W[rp];B[ol]C[H: Was this a good extension?  I think a large keima to R9 might have been better.

You could make this work if you want to run out the L8 stones. Otherwise, R9 or even R10 is better. 
Also, it's easier for W to invade now];W[qj]

Yes but failure to play S18 cost you even more.];W[rg];B[sg]
