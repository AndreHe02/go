C[Dear reviewer,
I think I know why I lost this game, it ended with black having too many groups spread over the board, though I don't know how I could have avoided this.

Hi dynamite,

the main problem of your play in this game was the passive way in which you handled your weak groups. You played many invasions and then defended a bit timidly. This does not go along very well. Also, you could have layed more importance on the development of your own framework instead of destroying your opponent's territory.

;W[mp]TR[fp][fq][gp][gq][hp][hq][ip][iq][jp][jq][kp][kq]C[Here I wanted to invade somewhere around the marked lower left part of the board, but I didn't know where, so I didn't...

T: I don't think it is necessary to invade already. You can do that later.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[ge];B[hd]C[T: This exchange is bad for W as B doesn't need to add another move.]
;W[dc];B[ck]
(;W[dj]LB[ci:D][cj:C][ck:A][dj:B]C[Was A good? Is there a way to respond to B without ending in overconcentrated shape?

T: I would have preferred C. This aims at the cutting possibility in the upper left corner. But A is a good move too. The normal response is D (see var.)

Until now, all your moves look good to me.

As Black is entering the white sphere of influence, a certain degree of overconcentration is unavoidable. You should not worry about this.]
;B[cj];W[ci]LB[di:A]C[T: An overplay! B can cut at A.]
(;B[dk]C[T: Mistake.];W[bi]LB[cn:A][ej:B][gk:C]C[T: Now, your main aim should be to secure eye space on the side by playing at A. This is also territorially bigger than in the game.

If you want to run out, play the atari at B first, then jump one space further at C.]

(;B[fk];W[cn];B[ej];W[di];B[el]LB[fh:A][ik:B]C[T: What's this??? This is no ponnuki as you haven't captured a white stone! This makes a big difference because you need one move more to complete it. (If a white stone is captured, one white move has no effect at all any more.) Assuming this form is worth 25 points, each of your four moves has a value of 6.25 points. This is the value of a big endgame move. So this is no effective shape.

Better shape is made by moves at A or B.];W[gq]LB[jq:A]C[T: Not good, as it leaves the possibility of entering at 3-3. A move around A is much better balanced.]
;B[jp]LB[ph:A][qh:B]C[T: You asked how you could have avoided having too many groups. The answer is: build up your own framework instead of reducing your opponent's one. This is something amateurs (including me) tend to overlook. A and B are very big moves, in my eyes they are bigger than the invasion.]
;W[iq];B[jq];W[ip];B[jo];W[in]
(;B[ln]LB[jn:B][mn:A]C[T: This is a half-way move. It is neither a good attack on W nor a good defense for B. Either, you can cap at A or defend at B, if you feel insecure with this.]
;W[mn]LB[ln:A]C[T: W leans on your group in order to connect to his stone on the right side. This shows the weakness of A.]
;B[mm];W[nn];B[lo];W[op]C[Great, now I got the weak group instead of my opponent, was there a way to prevent this?

T: See my previous comments.];B[pp];W[pm];B[km]LB[ll:A]C[T: This leaves the peep at A. Better connect firmly.]
;W[il];B[ll]LB[lj:A][lq:B]C[T: This move is not good again. Better A, or B to make eye shape while threatening to connect to hte corner.]
;W[gi]
(;B[ei];W[eh]
(;B[fh]C[T: This cut does not turn out to be good, you are too weak for it. The var. shows an alternative.]
;W[fi];B[hg];W[fj]C[T: B looses one possible eye.];B[ek];W[eg]
;B[hk];W[ik];B[hj];W[gh]
(;B[hm];W[im]
(;B[ho]LB[hn:C][ho:B][ij:D][io:A]C[T: It's better to move out to the center than to live locally, e.g at D.
This creates influence.];W[io];B[cq]CR[hm][ho]C[these 3 stones were only for creating aji, is that ok or is the result bad for b?

T: No, the two marked stones are aji keshi! B destroys the possibility of cutting at J5. Especially h5 is a very bad move.]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[gm];B[fm];W[gn]TR[ho]C[T: The marked stone is completely useless now.]
;B[dq];W[dm]
(;B[em]LB[ep:A]C[T: Again, it's better to move out.

But the best move here is A which is a serious threat against White. He should not have played tenuki in the corner.]
;W[ep];B[ii]C[T: Now your eye on the side is of little use since you are connected to the outside.]
;W[bp];B[bq];W[cp];B[bs]LB[fr:A]C[T: Wrong. Now your group can be killed. Better expand your eye space at A.]

(;B[mc];W[ke];B[jd];W[kd]
(;B[qh]LB[kg:C][qg:A][qh:B]C[A better? And was the invasion too greedy or neccesary?

T: I don't think the invasion is too greedy, and it is on the right point. But you might first have attacked the w stones at the top in order to build up some strength to help the invasion.]
