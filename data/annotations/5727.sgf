;B[qd]C[I am black in this game

crazyd:  Hi - I will try to review this game for you.  Your technique questions and variation diagrams didn't seem the most important area for you to work on.  You asked me to comment on direction of play - but the most important area was judging what is the biggest (most important) area of the board.  I hope you learn to ask yourself for every move 9at least during the opening), not do I need to respond or where or how to respond, but WHERE IS THE BIGGEST AREA ON THE BOARD RIGHT NOW.  That should jump you up several stones in strength in a short period.]
;W[pp]C[my opponent is 2 stones stronger than me by rank (I am 8k, he is 6k).

The questions I have about this game revolve around general direction of play, and better moves than what I made at key points in the game.

I have commented on the points that I can see.  Please let me know of anything else you find.]
;B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[od];B[pf]C[crazyd:  seems like a B pincer would be better choice, using upper left shimari]
;W[ld];B[pc];W[oc];B[gc]C[I think this move is small by comparrison with my other options.  I feel like k4 might have been better.

crazyd:  i agree too small - perhaps K16 or even L17 locally]
;W[jp];B[ck];W[pj];B[qi]C[crazyd:  O3 or R3 for B before white makes lower right territory - corner, side, center as the order of where to look for moves]
;W[qj];B[ri];W[rj];B[cn]C[crazyd:  white just played a strong wall around R10 - lower right seems most important area]
;W[co];B[gp]C[Is there a better way to invade/reduce this gigantic potential that he has?

crazyd: still, lower right is most profitable area for both]
;W[dn];B[cm]C[crazyd: way too small to defend one stone and not in big area]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[jq];B[eq]C[if W plays R3 now W wins, this was B big chance]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[fp];B[fo];W[fr];B[eo];W[go];B[gn];W[ho];B[do]
;W[dr]C[crazyd:  obviously both players do not see big area, since E2 is sente B5 is better locally for W]
;B[er];W[es];B[gr]C[I feel like I should have left this alone and played at f7 or e7 instead.]
;W[fs];B[ds];W[cs];B[gs];W[ds];B[cp];W[bo];B[fm];W[bq];B[dh]
;W[ic];B[ne]C[O14 seems better to me here

crazyd:  both players are myopic, need to think about whole board, corner-side-center]

;W[ob];B[im];W[hn];B[hm];W[jo];B[mo]C[I think this would have worked, but I didn't play it out correctly.  Is there a better point here?

crazyd:  both players need to work on opening and whole board vision, minor questions of would this reduce a little more are unimportant compared to looking for biggest area]

kozokawa [6k\]: thx

crazyd:  both players seemed not only about the same strength, but seemed to share the same weakness - playing and responding locally - rather than looking at the whole board for the biggest area.  B said he wanted help with direction of play, but the real problem was not looking at the board and playing in the biggest area.  Technique will continue to improve, but this seems the most important area for B to try to improve]
