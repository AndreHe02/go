C[Hi, thanks a lot for your help. I'm currently studying a lot with the goal to become a dan player so any comments that help me along the quest are welcome :) Especially moves that would have punished either side severly but were not played.

Joonas: Alright, I'll try my best. Hopefully you get some insight from the review!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qq];W[dd];B[pk];W[qi]C[A bit early for white to invade]

(;B[oi]C[This looks good, see also one alternative variation]
;W[pg]LB[nd:C][qe:B][ng:A]C[My initial ideas here for black would be capping at A to build center influence and prevent easy white escape, or if you want to switch to corner, B or C to keep a bit distance]
;B[qf]C[Not a bad result for black either, however R14 is a bit close. The proverb says "when attacking, keep distance to avoid making opponent stones stronger"]

(;W[qk]
(;B[pl]C[A calm way to play, although a hane at R8 might also be possible.]
;W[ql];B[qm];W[pm];B[qn]C[Good move!];W[pj];B[oj];W[ok];B[ol]
;W[nk];B[om];W[oh]C[Here I was quite satisfied with the exchange, white gets 2 stones that don't have strategic value while black got infliuence towards bottom right with the aim to make a huge territory there, what do you think?

J: I very much agree, white group is maybe 10 points and black has bigger potential. However, I'd personally continue still..]

(;B[nd]LB[fc:1][nc:A][jp:3][fq:2]TR[pd][qf]C[If you tenuki, you could also consider the triangled formation already strong -- white will not immediately want to approach at A,since it will only weaken his right side group. So I'd consider moves like 1-3 instead of this.]
;W[ni]C[White having to take the stones is very painful, so good start for black!]
;B[kq]LB[fc:A][jp:C][fq:B][iq:D]C[Not ambitious enough. Either A or B, or at least at C/D. Remember, you _want_ white to try invade around O3 now, because you will gain in attacking such a crude invasion!]

(;W[mq]C[This looks bad for white.];B[lo]C[Very nice approach from black. Even if white lives, it is painful.]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[pn]
(;B[po]C[I decided that it would be very difficult to save all stones and I much preferred to also give up these 4 stones and build a great and secure territory at the bottom.

J: It feels white is left off the hook a bit too easily here, I'd personally want to force white to show he really can live, and if he does, I'm quite certain I'd have sente to play F3 or F17 afterwards. It is a complex fight of course, see variation for something that might happen. 

Sacrifice is of course an option, but it doesn't squeeze the most out of white invasion.]
;W[on];B[oo];W[nn];B[no];W[mn]C[Could black just tenuki?]
(;B[mo]C[This might be too timid, see variation.];W[jc];B[ln]
C[The goal was to force white to respond, thus giving me an extra thickness towards the bottom left before approaching his corner stone. Is this thinking correct? Did white really have to answer or is it still too small at this stage of the game?

J: I think white could squeeze out as many points elsewhere, so maybe a bit early.]
;W[nm]C[However, now that white responds (and not with O8), you gain locally.]
;B[fq]LB[cf:A][cn:B]TR[nd][pd][qf]C[While it is a good approach move, it feels inadequate compensation considering the strength of bottom left. White will not want to expand here, so maybe A or even B instead to keep the initiative.

Also, now that white got K17, triangled stones look odd - there is still aji in the corner, and M17 for black is just too small to play comfortably. O16 earlier is only useful if you get to play on top first.]
;W[lm]C[White hanes to gain 2 points, a cause for celebration for black.]
;B[dn]C[Excellent! Ignoring a hoshi stone approach is rarely a good thing. C6 is another way to play, but this is great.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo]
(;B[go]LB[cp:B][cq:C][eq:A]C[This is definitely a bad move. You are gaining very little around J4, and hurting equally your D6 stone. You should either play A or B (or C) instead.]
;W[eq]C[White is secure and gets sente now.];B[gq]LB[cf:A][dk:C]
[fn:B]C[After this, white has many good options to expand his potential on the left side.]

(;W[er]C[Thankfully white is still concerned about his group.]

(;B[dk]LB[cf:A]C[I decided not to protect the territory after white E2 right away, as I felt that my D6 stone was getting weaker and weaker compared to the large white wall after the exchange. What do you think?

J: This is exactly right. Before I looked what you played, I was afraid you'd protect at F2.

But now that white group is more or less settled, I would leave D6 for the time being and go after the white formation on the top straight away. See variation at A.]

(;W[km]C[This again does absolutely nothing.];B[cf]C[Same reasonning here.

J: A superb move.];W[ch]
(;B[cj]C[Definitely not this move! You have plenty of space to run with this group that only serves to reduce white left side. Having white slide under is just bonus for black.]
;W[eg]C[Here is the point where you take the corner or double-approach and laugh at white E13. You still have B12 to connect this lone black stone.]

(;B[bd]
(;W[df];B[cc];W[em]C[Ouch! Black D17 will be huge later, and even if white gets that, black can reduce around K15.]
;B[en]C[I think D7 would be easier for black, seems like white E7 is wasted unless white continues.]
;W[fn];B[co];W[bp];B[cp];W[cq];B[lc]TR[fk]C[C5 group is not yet 100 % alive, so white might get valuable center stones with move like F9. M17 is of course still very large, so if you are confident you can reduce the center later, it's a good move.]
;W[in];B[hc]LB[je:2][fk:1]C[I felt it was more important to put a lot of pressure at the top, take a lot of territory from him while preparing an attack on this stone that would end up destroying territory potential in the middle for him. I was prepared to lose the 4 stones at G3 even though their death was not written yet.

J: Good judgement, and I don't see any way yet for G3 stones to be cut. White J6 would be better at F9 or even K15.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[jp];B[jq];W[hp];B[ir];W[io]C[xio [6k\]: good reasoning]
;B[ec]C[And again here I felt it was more valuable to take a fairly large corner. White could create a ko at the bottom but I was happy to pay that price.

J: Yes now it seems white has 5 useless stones at the top. Hard to see white recovering from here.]
;W[ce]
(;B[ie];W[id];B[hd];W[je]
(;B[dc]C[Strange tenuki, I don't see why black would not go for J14 before this. And in any case B14 would be better, unless I am missing something.]
;W[be];B[jf]C[Nice! You might consider the peep first, though, white gets a bit worse shape.]
;W[if];B[he];W[kf];B[jg];W[ke];B[hg];W[ih];B[ig];W[gf];B[gg]
;W[ff];B[hf];W[lg]
(;B[kh];W[li];B[ki];W[kj];B[jj];W[lh]LB[kb:2][fk:5][cm:4][bn:1]
[hr:3]C[Unnecessary move for white. Several moves are bigger and might still change the game.]
;B[bo];W[qc]C[Here I was quite surprised since I thought that you can't live with the 3-3 invasion if black has the two extensions. White proved me wrong, did my misplay it or was white right to invade?

J: It is so-and-so. I think my 7d friend might be able to give a definite answer. :)]

C[Nicely found ko!];B[nl]C[The mistake that cost me the game. I wanted to play this fun ko but there was no ko threat large enough on the board. I panicked and played this crappy move :)

J: True, even E15 is a loss even if you can kill.];W[nc]C[There is not much of importance after this so I'll conclude the review here. Black played a good game and more solid one than white -- white played several unnecessary moves and black got to play bigger moves elsewhere.

There were a few places where black could've taken a more severe route punishing white mistakes, I'd recommend trying a few games where you play the "most severe move" even if you are not sure you can hold your own in the fight that follows. It's good practice in any case.

Also, some moves in the fuseki were a bit timid, especially the left side had some problems, which thankfully were overcome due to way too many bad choices on white's part.

It was a nice game to review, hope you good some good ideas. Feel free to ask any additional questions if you like.
