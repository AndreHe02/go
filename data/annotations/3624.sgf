C[Hello, my name is Charles and I played White in this game.  As it's IGS the true strength of my opponent is widely erratic.  Here, he seemed about my level.  The game was very close throughout.  I'd like some information and suggestions on my play.  It was a serious game that took over an hour.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj]LB[qn:A][po:B]C[I've always been told this is urgent to prevent Black q-10

To approach the corner at A or B is more common.

R10 (or R11 a variant) is the recommended move, only if hoshi (Q4) is played at lower right.

With larger komi today, R10 or R9 to split the moyo are possible too, as when black reply with R6 white can still play R13 to settle nicely.]
;B[qo];W[jp]C[Same reason for B k-4.];B[cj];W[cl];B[cf];W[ch]
C[I cheated as this was in a Joseki book I was looking at.  Black responds wrong according to the book,  but my cut later seemed early and to my disadvantage.

Real play can be very different from joseki, it sort of examine your real strength :)]
;B[bh];W[fc];B[bd]LB[bi:A]C[E-12 was the recommended move for Black in the book.

I supposed you mean D12.

B16 is playable too, put a white stone at B16, you can see how big is this move.

White A for the next move maybe better, pls look at the variation.]

(;W[bg];B[cg];W[bi];B[dh];W[ci];B[di]LB[dg:B][bj:A]C[White A better, simply connected and aim to cut at B.]

;W[ah];B[ef]LB[bj:A][cn:B]C[I saw a-14 and b-10 as miai so I decide to cut at c-15.

Not entirely correct application of "miai" concept.

If black A sente, invasion at B is easy.];W[ce]LB[cc:A]C[What is a better move, this did not work in my favor as I saw it.

Simple way is just to play A to protect the corner and aim to cut at C15 next.

If by cutting direct give no good result, play indirect moves and aim to cut.]
;B[dc]C[This is why black welcomed this cut, you lose material at the corner.

Actually, black C17 better.

You can play C17, look at the variation.]

(;W[oj]C[Slow move. Look at the variation.];B[oh]SQ[oj]C[This exchange, black gained a lot.]
;W[jq]C[K3 doesn't help much (as C3 is open to black), E3 better.]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[Is this the right direction? Blacks upper left group seemed to strong to aim a wall at.

Yes, this is correct.];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
;W[fq];B[bn];W[bm]LB[md:B][nq:A]SQ[hb][oj][jq]C[Black exploits aji at d-4 later so is b-7 a good move?

As white has made a few slow moves, there is no time for B7 or C7 now, should invade at A or B.]
;B[do];W[dn];B[qk];W[pk]C[Ah, in my midgame I don't know if I do this right.  2 stones on the third line are called settled, yet I don't seem to be able to do this once the opponent approaches.

Your real play is quite OK.];B[ql];W[pl];B[rm]LB[rn:A]C[Here, white double hane at A is possible.]

(;W[pr]LB[mq:A]C[Since that iron pillar is so close, is this move exceptionally bad as it turned out? M-5 and M-7 look so pretty now that I look at it.

;B[hk];W[ik];B[mp]LB[rh:C][ni:A][ml:B]C[One of the few times I do what those guys in Hikaru no Go sometimes do. Grip my legs and almost resign.

Don't be afraid of cut, you just need to play eye-shape moves to put through, e.g. kosumi at A to aim for B.

You have a gote eye at C, so this group won't die easily.];W[nk]
;B[lm];W[ml];B[no];W[on];B[nn];W[nm];B[np]LB[rh:B][ol:A]C[Wasteful move, black is connected even without this.
