C[crux: Hi, my name is Bernd Schmidt, I'm 2dan at the local club.  I'm not strong enough to know correct play, but I hope to show you a few things to think about.

I've found this game harder to review than others since I felt that not very much happened in it.  I hope I can still give a few useful comments.

I've marked variations I added with (*) to distinguish them from yours.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[ec];B[oq];W[qj];B[qh]C[crux: Uncommon, as an extension in front of the shimari is typically more valuable.  It does occur in pro play, though.]

(;W[qm];B[cn];W[fq];B[ck];W[cd];B[hq];W[co]LB[bp:A]C[crux: Could consider just playing A instead.  White's corner will be secure and Black's stones slightly weakened.]
;B[dn];W[bn];B[bm];W[bo]C[crux: Could consider tenuki.  The hane prevents a 3-3 invasion even without the connection.]
;B[ho]C[I have the feeling that I must invade the lower area now or it will be too late

crux: The top seems wider.];W[kp];B[lq]C[crux: Really bad.]
;W[kq];B[lp];W[ko];B[ep];W[eq];B[do];W[dq];B[km];W[lo];B[no]
;W[lm];B[kn]C[crux: Black seems to have lots of shape weaknesses.  The question is how best to exploit them.]

(;W[ln];B[kl];W[ll]C[crux: Essentially, this is pushing from behind.  Probably better to connect to the right side now.]
;B[pl]C[crux: Nice leaning attack.];W[ql];B[pj];W[pm];B[qk]
;W[rk];B[pk];W[nm]LB[kk:C][nn:B][om:A]C[crux: Leaves a weakness at A.  Paradoxically, B may be a stronger connection.
If White thinks he can live on the right side, C is a very important point for the balance of power.]
;B[kk];W[rj];B[lk]C[crux: It was rather good for Black to get those last two moves.]
;W[nk]LB[pi:A]C[Is this move a waste?

crux: Mostly.  A weakness remains even after this move (which Black later kind of tries to exploit).  Also, the cut at A may be better.]
;B[nj];W[jd]
(;B[ch]C[I think this is small

crux: There appears to be a black center moyo, and the move devalues the area in front of your shimari.  I don't think it's too bad.]
;W[nc];B[hd]C[I am thinking that I can chase him and destroy his center left moyo]
;W[fe]LB[if:A]C[crux: You're attacking from the strong side, and Black can just jump out.  How about A?]
;B[fg]C[but he senses this and protects];W[hf]C[So I go after teh upper side which is big, too.]
;B[hg];W[if];B[gf];W[ge];B[ld]LB[ig:C][lc:A][qc:B]C[I have to be careful here.  Not sure if jumping or going into the corner is better, and why.

crux: A and B seem sort of miai to settle the single white stone, so how about playing the large turn at C first?]
;W[ne];B[lf];W[lc];B[kc];W[kd];B[mc];W[lb];B[md];W[mb];B[nd]
;W[oc];B[od];W[pc];B[ig];W[jf];B[jg]C[smaller than R16,  I think.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[rd]LB[qc:A][re:B]C[crux: This one I'd play at A, which looks forward to the hane at B later.]
;B[re];W[se];B[kf]C[very small I think];W[fo];B[gn];W[cf];B[je]
;W[id];B[ie];W[he];B[ke];W[jb];B[mk];W[rf];B[qf];W[rg];B[rh]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[ph]C[miai to capture one of 2 small groups.]

(;W[om]LB[lr:B][np:C][po:A]C[crux: "Force before defending" would suggest to play A first (and possibly moves around B); these might no longer be quite as sente after White connects the ko.

I think (without being 100% sure), that capturing at C lives locally, and may be another option that's bigger than just connecting the ko.]
;B[kr];W[jr];B[lr];W[jn];B[in];W[jo]LB[ip:A]C[Do you see maybe one big yose mistake from here on out?

crux: Here, instead of the game move, the peep at A is kind of interesting.]
;B[jm];W[fp]LB[em:B][eo:A]C[crux: This needs to be at A, to threaten a jump at B.]
;B[ni]C[crux: That looks like a nice double sente point (i.e. you should have got there earlier).]
