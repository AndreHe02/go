RE[B+63.5]

C[I found that this game was incorrectly scored, though it made no difference.   In actuallity the total was 60.5 to 124.  My loss.

Did I really play this game so horribly?   It seems most of my games work out this way.  Now I look back and at least one of my IGS wins was actually a loss if counted correctly.



>GreyFalkon: Good day
>*OldRamGO*: hi];B[pd];W[do]C[when white played 2 what was your strategy?]
;B[gp];W[ep]C[white 4 is not consistent with the opening at d5, playing the 4,5 point suggest emphasising the sides; an extension along the side to d9 would have been expected. White 4 at e4 is very close to white 2, and black can ignore it.]
;B[dm]LB[dk:A]C[black 5 punishes white 4, black would likely have played along the bottom edge if whte 4 was at A]
;W[en]LB[fn:B][dk:C]C[what is white 6 trying to achieve? B to move out to the cenntre, or C to attack one of black's stones would have been more useful.]
;B[em];W[fm];B[gm]LB[pp:D][fn:E]C[white 8 is hane at the head of two stones, but does not take a big point, such as D. Black 9 lets you off the hook (expected black to play E).]
;W[gn];B[hn];W[gl];B[go]C[>GreyFalkon: Ah, early attacker];W[hm]
;B[im];W[in];B[ho];W[io];B[jn];W[hp];B[ip];W[hq]C[sequence to 22 gives up two white stones, with liuttle real benefit in exchange.]
;B[jo];W[fq];B[hl];W[gm];B[fo];W[gq];B[fn]C[OldRamGO should have let the F6 group go earlier.  But it turned into a good ploy for him.  I left the rest of the board untouched for too long.]
;W[dn];B[fl]C[Now white has lost / gained very little from 5 stones, black has gained substantial outside strength.]
;W[gk];B[fk];W[gj];B[fj];W[gi];B[cn]C[white to 36 is apparently pushing ahead, but white has 8 stones without a base, where are they going? Black stones to 37 start to make substantial Territory.]
;W[fi];B[co];W[dp];B[cq];W[ej];B[ek];W[dk]C[I am concentrating WAY too much here in this area.]
;B[el];W[dl];B[cm]C[white to 46 poses several cutting points, black's mves to 47 are also to be questioned. Both players seem to suffer myopia - there is lots of board to be played.]
;W[cl];B[dj]C[I should have seen that cut coming.];W[ei];B[bl]
C[I can't see how I could have gotten out of this loss.];W[cj]
;B[ck]C[black now has 10 points of area on l.h. side, white has little secure area, and a weak group.]

;B[am];W[bp];B[bo];W[ap];B[ao]C[Let myself get witty here and lost track of my bad position.  I don't have a single eye.

;W[fr];B[hr];W[er]C[I wish I knew what he meant by this.

> *OldRamGO*: Check it....];B[ds];W[dr];B[es];W[fs];B[br]C[I think he is wasting time here now.  Unless it is to deny me territory.]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[cs];B[bs];W[ar];B[gs];W[hk]C[At least I cam out alright, and 88 made sure he did not make an eye, but now I realize it was a wasted move that I should have put at another corner.
Both plays have lost the plot.];B[il];W[ik];B[jj];W[jk];B[lk]
;W[jl];B[jm];W[eh];B[cg];W[dg];B[de];W[cf]C[I don't even think I realized at this time that I was in a desperate battle for life at this moment.

I think he did.   He kept my focus on the corner and not where it should have been --the whole board.]
;B[df];W[ef];B[ce];W[bf];B[bg];W[ch]C[B14 and C14 are lost.  I see that now.]
;B[be];W[bh];B[af];W[ah];B[fg];W[eg];B[fe];W[ee]C[Finally, eyes]
;B[ed];W[ag];B[ih];W[km];B[kl];W[kk];B[lm];W[ml]C[Here I had intended to play at M8, but a lag hiccup in the network caused it to not respond.  I tried a couple times and when it finally placed, it placed in N8.  Bad for me.  He seemed to ignore it, so I did not feel comfortable undoing.
white 124 can be readily ignored.

> GreyFalkon: crap
> GreyFalkon: hate lag click];B[kn];W[mk];B[lj]C[white is pinned down in the upper half and in the lower half where black has plenty of power.]
;W[kj];B[ki];W[mj];B[ok];W[ll];B[mm];W[li];B[lh]C[Is white trying to develop territory or power? it seems neither at present. White's stones are connected, but that tactic is atthe apparent expense of any strategy.]
;W[km];B[mi];W[kl]C[He must have let me have that.];B[ff];W[mh]
C[All about him building in the A19 corner of the board, and I was too busy watching the center of the board.]

;W[ol];B[pl];W[om];B[pn];W[mn];B[ln];W[nn];B[no];W[nl]C[The way I played this really hurt me.  I keep finding myself answering the same way to captures and attacks.  I stay on them stubbornly when I should let it go and secure another area.

White seems to play close, and repeas the same style of play withthe same consequences: why?]
;B[mo];W[pm];B[qm];W[pq];B[pr];W[qr]C[I finally realize this.]

;B[ro];W[rq];B[pp];W[sp];B[sr]C[Bad ploy on my part.  I have no way to make good eyes without loss.

Playing close to black strength will not make life easy.];W[so]
;B[rn];W[sn];B[sm];W[aq]C[202, wasted move better left undone.  So, of course, I play it.]
;B[rg];W[lq]C[Here is where I gave up the game TOTALLY.  Next time I will have to show up to play with my brain actually ON.
White 104 cannot live, look around - there is no opportunity for eye space. Some study of life and death, and the space needed to make two eyes is needed. Black may have played poorly at times, but white continued to repeat obvious errors. Slow down and read out the moves.

Perhaps white needs o practice. Try reading Kageyama's lessons in the fundamentals of go.]
;B[mr];W[jc];B[jd];W[fb];B[hc];W[nd];B[mc];W[he];B[jb];W[qc]
C[white's stones are dancing, but without any real hope of life. White 114 has the best chance - at least that corner is not all black's just yet, but it won't be easy making life.]
;B[rc];W[qg]LB[qd:G][pc:H]C[if you intend to make life in the corner 116 should have been played at G or H; H is preferable as there is a white stone at O16.]
;B[pg]C[Play anywhere tactic.   I use this hoping that fortune smiles on me.]
;W[qf];B[qd]C[White 118 did nothing and Black 119 sealed the fate of white trying to make life in the corner.]

C[Don't know what I am trying to accomplish with 204 and 260.

The way I thought of scoring was based off the automatic scoring of gGo.  In it's auto system, if there is any opposing color in an area surrounded by one color, then that Territory is concidered unclaimed.

You must learn to count - as a human and rational intelligent being, don't rely on computers.]
