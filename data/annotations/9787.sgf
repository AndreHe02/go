C[Dear Reviewer,

this is one of my rare games on KGS; normally I play on DGS with almost unlimited time to think.

I have provided a few comments in the game, telling you what my intentions were, and would be very happy for anything that you see I could do better.

My weakness is often to do big moves before small moves. Please tell me whether I could have done better.

Thanks!
Hanspeter

Hi! My name is Paco, Im 6k KGS now, but normally Im 5k. Il start my comments with a P.]
;B[pd]C[P: I will resume the comentaries in three good advices:

1. Attack when you can. He had weak groups that you didnt attack. In go you always have to be looking for attacking weak groups for he to be defending and you making territory. He had two weak groups in the low left that you didnt attack well

2. Play in the big spaces soon. Dont let him make moyo. You played O 17 too late. He made a big wall in the low right and made a moyo

3. Dont do small moves. If the fight is over, if you cant kill and neither can he, move anywhere else]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qn];W[nq];B[pk]C[H: This move seems strange, it does not feel threatening, so I move to another corner. Plan; standard low approach Joseki to build a connection to my d4.

P: This move is correct. Q10 is more usual, but Q9 make him easier to enter in R3 later]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[dj];B[co]C[H: Diagonal approach? I take this as an invitation to build a wall towards the bottom and connect to O3 eventually.
P: I see B5 as too close and your response correct];W[cp];B[bp]
;W[bq];B[ap]
(;W[aq];B[bn]C[H: This black group looks weak and I put some pressure on it while strengthening my left side.

P: You have induce him to make one eye, and you make so little territory with A3. See variation]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[bl]C[P: I think this is not a bad move, since black has to defend himself and you are getting strong. Im not sure is the best. I would have played in the open spaces and let this attack for later, but I think is ok anyway]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[el]C[H: My left side is secure, so I'll form a base at the bottom to later attack the centre.]
;W[gp];B[do]
(;W[eo]C[H: Mistake! Too greedy from me.
P: I dont think that greedy is the word. What have you been doing before. You were attacking and at the same time making territory. That´s the best thing you can do in go. Maybe there were better moves, but you were getting what you wanted.

What do you want now with this move? is not really a good attack. His group has already scaped. You are not getting too much territory.

In the other hand you have a weakness on c3]
(;B[en]
(;W[fo]C[H: This is definitely wrong, my lower left crumbles (or would crumble if Tatser hadn't made a stupid mistake later)]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[cq]
(;W[fp];B[br];W[dq];B[cr];W[dr]C[P: The previous mistakes are typical. You will learn just playing. But this one is important for you to pay attention. You have already loose the two stones. Say good bye and dont fight for them. D3 was sente, so was not a mistake, but this is for what? Is tooooooo little.]
;B[ds];W[es]C[P This too, and black move too];B[cs]C[H: OK, Corner lost, but I will at least try to attack the still not so strong black group.]
;W[dm]C[P: What are you doing? This is for what? You have just loose a movement and there are big spaces in the right side]
;B[dn]C[P: Not necesary];W[bm];B[em];W[an]C[P: This is for nothing. You simply have luck later. You are loosing ko threaths]
;B[ao]C[H: Ouch, a bad mistake by black. The corner is mine again.]
;W[bo]C[P: Lucky guy];B[cn]
(;W[ar]C[P: The corner is yours anyway. This movement is useless and you are loosing the oportunity to attack black one-only-eyed group]
;B[ip]C[H: This move looks a bit high up; I try to go below ...]
;W[kq];B[hq];W[gq];B[gr];W[fr];B[gs];W[fs];B[ir];W[kr];B[hn]
C[H: OK, sound basis at the bottom for me, not much for black there. Let's move up and extend my left side while attacking black's top.]
;W[ef];B[no]C[H: He ignores it??????];W[ro];B[rn];W[qo];B[pn]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[kn];B[mn];W[mo];B[oo];W[op];B[so];W[sp];B[sn]
;W[rq]C[H: Here I thought "I'll not leave a weak corner behind again!" I played s3 instead of s4 to prevent a peek on r3 later.]
;B[lk]C[H: Curious. He defends a region where he already has a good wall. I'll attack the top, then. Plan: standard low approch Joseki and the connect that group to e14.]
;W[nc]C[P: Take a look at move 63 and see the diference in playing O18 in that  moment. Now he can make an enormous moyo in the right]

(;B[oc]
(;W[kc]C[P: O16 better]
(;B[nb]TR[ne][qf]
(;W[mb]C[P: You have to enter in his moyo. You have to play light. You are in his territory. You have to make sabaki: play light fighting, ready to sacrifice. See the cutting pointin N17 in variation]

(;B[na];W[nd]C[H: OK, he didn't go for the standard Joseki. I try to get a good basis on the top now.]
;B[pg]C[H: I will STILL work on the top first, otherwise he'll soon be able to push my top group into his nice black sidewall.]
;W[hc];B[hb];W[ib];B[gb];W[hd]C[H: I love my top group, it looks very strong.]
;B[fe]
(;W[hf]C[P: So if your group is strong, you dont have to make moves like this to make him stronger. Take a look at the board¿Are you winning? Maybe, but he can make a whole lot of territory in the right. You should reduce. See variation]
;B[lg]C[H: The stone arranement m9-q9-m13-q13-q16 looks very weak. I'll attack it before it gets strong.]

(;W[of]C[P: This is not a good attack, he has closed his territory. See variation. 

Anyway you should have atacked before];B[pf];W[og];B[oh];W[oe]
;B[pe];W[mf];B[hh];W[jg];B[jh];W[mg];B[lh];W[mh];B[mi]C[H: OK, that attack did not get very far. Could I have got further? To relax my mind, I'll solidify my top group in sente.

P: It was hard to do it better. You could have tried doing something complicated (sabaki) as my previous variation.]
;W[ma];B[pb]C[H: This already was enough time to relax. My main mission is still to put pressure on the centre, as this is now the only place where black could make enough points to win.]
;W[ff];B[ee];W[ce];B[fh]
(;W[eh]TR[jo]C[P: Theese movers are slow and you have to enter in the center. See variation]
;B[ei];W[dh];B[di];W[ci];B[ej];W[ek];B[fk];W[fi];B[fj];W[gi]
;B[gh];W[hi];B[ii];W[ig];B[ih];W[ch];B[hj]C[H: That move looked VERY useless, probably born by fear. Or could I have done something ugly if black had played somewhere else?

Still, my mission is to destroy the centre. No from the last opening, the bottom.]

;W[fn];B[fm];W[hp];B[io];W[in];B[ho];W[jo];B[jq];W[jp];B[iq]
;W[js];B[is];W[kk];B[kj];W[np];B[gn]C[H: Another not so important move by black, it seemed to me. The centre is setteld, but now the next big spot is the top left corner.]
;W[bb];B[cb];W[bc];B[ba];W[cd];B[ec];W[gc];B[fb];W[de];B[kf]
C[H: That was a surprise, somehow I forgot that this was still open.]
;W[lf];B[kg];W[ke];B[jf];W[je];B[if];W[hg];B[he];W[ie];B[ge]
;W[gf];B[gd]C[H: OK, top group protected, but now he has made a spot where I can extend further into the centre through a chain of two atari threats.]
;W[li];B[kh];W[ni];B[mj];W[nh];B[oi];W[nj];B[nk];W[oj];B[pj]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[nl]C[H: I see another, longer atari threat chain. Will probably not work, but as long as I remain in sente, it is OK to try.]
;B[mk];W[pl];B[om];W[pi];B[ph];W[qi];B[qj];W[qk];B[rj];W[pm]
;B[ql]C[H: OK, didn't work. Could it have worked without him making a mistake? The game is drawing to an end, I'll now try to finish the borders of my territory. There is not much left to do.]
;W[ia];B[ha];W[ic];B[rk]C[H: ???? Was that white stone dangerous?]
;W[nm];B[qm];W[po];B[nn];W[jj];B[ki];W[ij];B[gj];W[fg];B[rh]
;W[ab];B[ca];W[cj];B[jr]C[H: I wonder what he did during those five minutes. I know what I did: I checked all boundaries and memorized what I would do as a reply to all the moves I predicted, which actually were the moves he made, in the order he made them.]
;W[ks];B[od];W[ne];B[kp]C[H: And here I realised that I was tired. I did a quick breathing meditation exercise, and then played solidly.]
;W[ko];B[qr]C[H: This was now not frightening. s3 now proves to be in a good place, and as long as I can connect all my stones, he'll never make two eyes.]
