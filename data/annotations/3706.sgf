C[Hi thanks for the review.  I play white.  I am interested in comments on the fuseki and middle game.  I would like to know my weak points so I know what to work on.
This was a territory vs. influence game, with black taking the corners, and white concentrating on a big moyo on the upper side. I lose by 8 points.
Whenever Black played the 3-2 point I tried to jump right in before he has time play a second move and make a shimari.  Is this a good strategy and did I execute it properly?


The position Black adopts in this game is well known as the Shusaku fuseki. You should consider how the black stones relate to each other when adopting a particular strategy, rather than focussing too much on local situations. Shusaku style lends itself to territorial play on a large scale, and it is how the stones work together that helps this.

One approach is to try and establish a settled position on the right side, or at the bottom, interfering with the development of the black stones toward each other. A Black pincer attack in reply is common so you may wish to make your approach moves high, especially if you are considering countering the territorial approach of Black with outside influence. Look carefully at the variations where White presses Black into a low position.]

(;W[qo]C[Is R5 a good move?  Black's answer (a pincer at Q8) seems to work well for him.

It is unusual to see Black Q8 so early, and the natural responses you may consider (see variations at move 10) are going to impact on your stone at R5. A high approach (Q5, see variation) can also be considered, and is a little more flexible, particularly if you are going to emphasise influence.]
;B[pl];W[no];B[mq]C[Should I force at P4 to solidify my position here?

If you want to solidify your position, you need to establish a base for your stones, with something like R3 (see variation) but you run the risk of being sealed into the corner. You could use your stones to, for example, press at M4, then see how black responds. You can keep pressing Black into a low position if the response is at M3, and followup with a pincer attack on Q8 when the White stones are stronger. If Black pushes up and cuts (N4, N5, M5) then a followup approach around E3 or F3 is effective.]

(;W[ph]LB[pe:A][pf:B][qf:C][pg:D][qg:E][pi:F][pj:G][qj:H]C[My thinking here was to attack Q8 stone while preparing to surround the R16 stone.  I have no idea if my move actually accomplishes that.  Any alternatives?

This move is the one position that achieves neither of your objectives.
It is not attacking Q8 or R16. If you want to make a move on the (upper) right then there are a number of alternatives you can consider (a-h).
 
Playing at A might lead to something like the first variation.
White builds a wall, and black secures a position on the side. The natural momentum for Black following this variation might be the approach in the upper left, in which case White's wall will start to generate profit.

You probably want to stay away from the Taisha (B). Moves like C, D and E are also going to induce attach and extend  at P16. Your stones can try and take up a position on the right side, but you'll have forced Black to split your stones in two, and any enclosure on the right is going to set Q8 in motion, weakening your stones below. The second variation shows one possible continuation.

F, G and H attack Q8. The natural response is to jump out to O8, which weakens the White stones below. They will need to be strengthened, and keep their path to the centre open. See the third variation for one possible continuation.]

(;B[pc];W[od];B[qf];W[of];B[qi];W[kd]C[I had an eye on the weak Q5 stones but L16 just looked massive.

I would also consider K17 but yes, the upper side is big. The weak stones still have room to either live in the corner or escape into the centre.]
;B[po];W[pn];B[oo];W[on];B[oq];W[qm];B[qh];W[eq];B[do];W[hq]
;B[dq];W[ep]C[Think before you play an automatic response like this. If Black presses the attack you can slide away to L3. Now might be the time to take the large point on the left, say with D10.]
;B[ck];W[cg];B[jq];W[gc]C[My idea is to provoke a 3-3 invasion and build a big moyo.  Maybe D17 is better.

The idea is OK (I'd be worried having weak groups scattered behind me on the lower side - Black is going to be able to make large gains attacking them.) D17 leaves the weakness at J17 exposed.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf]C[D15 is the automatic followup for Black. Why not just connect at C14 and force Black to end in gote?]
;B[de];W[cf];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]C[B14 leaves you with the aji of D15 and bad shape...]
;B[ad]C[Finishing the joseki at E15 seemed unnecessary.

But it does mean that your next play will have to be on the left. If this is what you plan, OK, but don't forget the aji at D15 this leaves you with.]

(;W[ci]C[This is a small extension and virtually guarantees Black will jump out (to avoid the danger of white C7), damaging the moyo on which you are pinning your hopes. I think the shoulder hit at D10 is bigger, and naturally expands your moyo.]
;B[ek];W[ei];B[nn]C[Your weak groups start to come back and haunt you. The lead you had gets whittled away by Black's expansion around M6. An earlier move around S9 establishing a base for your group (and also threatening Q8) would allow you to resist O6 more strongly.]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[ol];B[ln];W[ho];B[eo];W[fo];B[fn]
(;W[er]C[I think this is a losing move. G5 is enough to live and does not give Black his attack on the moyo above.]
;B[go];W[fp];B[gn];W[gp];B[cr];W[ir];B[jr];W[hn]C[This move is from the wrong direction, and doesnt secure the group anyway. You could push at G10, then defend at G2.]
;B[gk];W[gi];B[jj]C[I realise K10 is reducing my moyo, but is also blocking H3 group's escape route so I defend.
But I guess this is where I lost the game.

The loss was built on the earlier questionable moves - the weak group on the right, the lost opportunity at E10 and the awful shape of F4.]

(;W[gr];B[jh];W[hg];B[mi]
(;W[rq]C[At this point the Black stones in the centre are still not settled. White L13 threatens them and defends the White moyo. S3 and Q9 are miai for life for the White group and profit on the side.]

(;W[qr]C[R2 is too small - you are playing endgame moves when K14 is bigger. Keep R2 or Q9 for later. Beyond this I have only a couple of comments - the outcome is essentially decided.

White left two weak groups unsettled early in the middle game, and the burden of these played a major role in undoing the large moyo strategy. One additional move for each group would have settled them, and allowed White to resist Black's attacks more vigorously later on.

I hope my comments have been helpful.];B[jf];W[ie];B[me];W[mc]
