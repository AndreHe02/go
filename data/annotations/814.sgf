AB[pd][dp]C[Here is the review of your game. Look very throughly through
it. I have made many variations for you.

Have fun];W[dd];B[pp]C[So far so good. Black taking the last remaining corner is wise.]

(;W[cf]LB[qj:d][jq:c][cn:b][nc:a]TR[cf]C[I think this is a white mistake. It would have been better for
white to either play kakari at 'a' or 'b' or split one of blacks
sides by playing 'c' or 'd'.  The marked stone is just too low
for the influence that black has on the board.

See variations.]
(;B[fc]C[This approach move by black is bad. Black should punish white
severly by making the sanren-sei formation on the right side.
In this game making the sanren-sei formation on the right side
is very powerful as it threatens to make a  3 dimensional moyo. Look at the variations. for Black 4]

(;W[hd]LB[hc:a]C[White 5 is allright but I think the low pincer at 'a' would be
better. See the variation.]
(;B[hc]LB[fe:a]C[F16 instead?

No F16 would have just made a heavy black group. There are circumstances
where making the "iron pillar' is powerful.    At this point jumping to 'a' is best. See the variation. If you
take the corner white gets huge thickness and you will have to
deal with it for the rest of the game. Look at the white thickness
long and hard in that varation. Convince yourself that it is
worth way more than the black territory and you will gain a couple
stones in strength.];W[fd]LB[gd:a]C[This move by white is not good. Black can severly punish him
if he is not timid.
By pushing through at 'a' . After that whites position is full
of cutting points.]
(;B[ch]C[K16 instead?

As I should in another variation playing at 'a' would have been
best for black.  K 16 would have been bad.  But playing here is the worst.  After
playing the marked stones at the top you just can't leave them.
Lets look at some variations.];W[ec]C[This white move fails to punish black as severly as he could
have.]
(;B[fb]TR[ch]C[This descent by black is very bad. It is small. It is gote. It
does nothing to secure the black stones. Pushing at 'a' still
would be far far superior. In fact now that the marked stone
is on the board this move becomes better.];W[eb]C[This move by white is okay. But I think there are much bigger
moves on the board. E18 is not urgent becuase the black stones
are weak anyways. Let black deal with the problem. You go stir
some trouble up on the board.]
(;B[nc]LB[gd:a]C[J16 or K16 instead?

Still Pushing at 'a' is best.];W[ic]C[I have no complaints about this move. If black is to take the
corner then I would take these stones. White will be very thick
when he takes them. All of his stones will be strong and he will
be free to attack black.];B[ib]
(;W[hb]C[This white atari is bad. It just makes B's stones stronger. White
should press at 'a' instead. Settleing his corner (which is quite
large) and then attack B's resulting weak positions.

See variations];B[gc];W[jb];B[id]C[This black cut is great!]
;W[ia]
(;B[jc]C[This B atari is bad. If B is going to push out at 'a' then I
would do that first and see how white responds.];W[ib];B[gd]
;W[he];B[ge];W[ie];B[fe];W[jd];B[ed]C[This exchange is odd and should have never happened. White should
have taken the two stones shown in an earlier variation.];W[kc]
LB[dc:a]C[taking with white 29 is bad here as B will (or should (smile)
immediatly cut at 'a']
(;B[lb]LB[jp:d][dc:c][id:b][jc:a]C[This move is pointless. It is on the second line. It "could be"
an eye-stealing tesuji. If white was not already alive with eyes
at 'a' and 'b' black should have cut at 'c' left the strong b
stones (the marked stones) to look after them selves and made
a sanren sei at 'd'];W[ee]LB[ee:a]C[This white move is bad as black should just cut at 'a']

(;B[ef];W[de];B[cn]
(;W[fq]TR[cn]C[Why didn't white cut at 'a'. this really would have been terrible
for black. So this definatly shows that black playing the marked
stone is a mistake. But white makes a mistake also by approaching
the Black corner enclosure.];B[eq]TR[ch]C[Protecting the corner is wise for black now. Especially with
his weak group at the top. and the marked stone which is to close
to whites thickess for comfort.];W[iq]C[This white extension is bad as you know the next move that is
coming from black. So this would say that the approach  move
at F3 was bad.];B[fp];W[gp]C[This white move is really bad.  As Black will just G3]

(;B[fr]C[G3?

Yes G3 would have been better. This strengthens white.];W[gq]
;B[nq]LB[pj:a]C[This black shimari is great right now. When you extend from stromg
positions the value of each move increases. In this postion Blacks
follow up move at 'a' is huge. the problem is if white takes
it black will slide to 'b' making the marked white group easy
prey.]
(;W[gr];B[es]LB[dr:b][er:a]C[Black should simply connect at 'a' here. Look at the board before
you play your stones. What will you do if white later plays at
'b'? Here the hanging connection just leaves devastating aji
behind in the corner.];W[fo];B[ep];W[lq]C[All these last white moves where ok in settling his group I think.
Though in a handicap game white needs to play more strongly than
he is here.];B[qj]LB[oj:g][qp:e][qd:d][qq:c][qc:b][dr:a][ck:f]

[cm][cl][cj][ci][bh][ah][af][bf][cf][de][dd][ec][eb][ea]C[Okay this is a great move by black. All commendations for this
move. It is the right direction of play.  Though it is to bad
that in this game the corner shimari's are based on the 4-4 stone.
If these shimaris where based on the 3-4 stone then would have
been devastating to white. But with the stones high. White  still has the opportunity to invade the corner when the time
is right.

Okay at this point lets look at who is ahead. Some quick territory
analysis.
If we say the territory within the enclosed areas are each players.
Then black is clearly in the lead. But at we have discussed before
there is the bad move at 'a' White could play as well as invasions
at ''b', 'c', 'd', 'e' or 'f'  or a capping play at 'g'


Even so if black plays safely he should win this game.];W[ln]
TR[lq][iq][gp][fq][gq][gr]SQ[fo]C[why didn't white invade right hand side?

White is still worried about the life of his marked stones. But
becuase of the presence of the marked white hane  they are quite safe. But in addition to strengthening his group
he is building up to invade the right side. What makes this move
especially nice us that it is again an indirect attack on the
eyeless black group at the top. As we see in the continuation
of the game as black takes territory white expands his influence
in the center.];B[qm];W[nm]LB[fh:a][gf:c][ff:b]TR[ch][ef]C[After this move the white stones are  attacking the eyeless black
group at the top fiercely. If I where black I would definatly
play at 'a' now.  The white  stone is a ladder break for the
cut at 'b'  so black would have to push at 'c' weakening the marked stones
severly.  The group at the top would still be eyeless.  White 51 is an
excellent move. Black should not have let white make it.

If white cuts at 'b' after black 'a' black can get a good squeeze
play.]
(;B[ok]SQ[rr][qr][qq][rq][rp][qp][rc][rd][qd][qc][re][rf][rg]
[rh][qh][qg][qf][qe]C[needed?

It is a good move but your corner is still open and the marked
area is open to invasion. As well as the marked area below. Whites
center is getting larger and the poor black group is getting
sadder.]
(;W[nk]C[This is an okay move by white.  But I can't help but think the
non contact play of the knight move to 'a' to be better.];B[nj]
;W[nl]C[would the cut have been significant? white  could've still lived

White cannot cut here. If white cuts at P10 P11 captures w in
a ladder. I like this white move. It is steady.];B[pg];W[mj]
C[pressing black again here is good. Every move strengthens the
attack on the top b gropu and increases whites terratorial chance
in the center.];B[ni];W[fg]C[After white 59 it is difficult for black to salvage the situation.
I think blacks only choice is to play at maybe 'a' sacrificing
the black group and attempting to make sabaki in the center and
get white to drive you into his moyo and hope to make life. Otherwise
with the top group and the entire center which white would get
if you tried to save this group. And if you did save this group
white would be sio strong everywhere that he would invade all
your weak positions. So again in this game this black group was
vital. Not for territory but for the balance of power on the
board. With this group unstable white was able make a very keen
attack.];B[ff];W[eg];B[df];W[dg];B[cg];W[ce];B[gg];W[hf];B[gf]

connecting strongly especially if you can do it in sente. The
sacrifice of the white stones is only 6 points. Invading a black
corner after 'a' is much bigger than 6 points.]

C[What were you thinking when playing the marked black stones?
Had white played properly here you would have only damaged yourself.
Always look at the best move that your opponent could make. And
make the best response to that move before he makes it. Don't
ever hope he will make the blunder that you needed to win the
game.];W[no];B[mp];W[np];B[mq];W[lp];B[op]C[should I have cut at m5?

This result is excellent for you. Unfortunatly you only got it
becuase white was overly concerned with saving 3 stones and not
looking at the whole board.  This is perfect for you. You have
a chance to win again.];W[lo];B[kf];W[oq];B[or];W[qq];B[pq]

C[Okay after this the game is over for black. White can still invade
the top right. The b group at the top is dead. White just made
40 pts at the bottom.

This game was lost by black making some very bad oversights in
reading. Look at the board read out positions much more carefully,
Don't leave forcing moves for your opponent.

I would reccomend you both to pick up Lessons in the fundementals
of Go. It is a great book and you both would gain at least 3-4
stones from really studying it.

Study some Tesuji, Some L & D, and maybe pickup 38 basic joseki.
