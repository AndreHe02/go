C[zergs:I m black
Leroic is a friend from the web
He told me I was passif in the game, can you tell me what more active move I should have made ?

Reviewer Ghost : 
The difference in levels between the two players should have made this equal (non handicap) game awkward, but White clearly played to teach Black and this resulted in a simple game, where black did not make any big mistakes, but just played moves that were not big enough, or not at the right time. My general advice to black would be to try and invade more, and to study the basic 3-3 and 3-4 invasions.

Results W+36.5];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd]
(;B[pj]LB[ed:a][ec:b];W[jp]C[Gost : White takes a  big point instead of approaching Black and apparently waits for Black to take the initiative]
;B[ed]C[Gost : Good point];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[cf];B[ic]
LB[jd:a][jc:b]C[zergs : J17 is that right ? is that joseki ?

Gost : this is too low and too close. 'a' and 'b' were possible extensions, with a preference for 'a'. This makes Black a little too cramped.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd]C[Ghost : standard approach, and good response]
;W[qi]C[Ghost: these moves (on the 3rd line, kosumi on a stone on the fourth) is usually bad shape. Black should be able to use this later]
;B[qj]C[Ghost : this is not really necessary since black does not really protect territory this way, and lets white take sente (initiative). Defending the lower right corner or approaching the lower left corner would probably be better]
;W[nq]C[Ghost : As expected, white reduces black's corner, and creates a moyo on the bottom. This is hard on black]
;B[pi]LB[qq:a][pn:b]TR[pf][qf][qi]C[Ghost : A mistake at this time of the game. it allows white either to invade at 'a', or make a double approach at 'b'. White has the possiblity to sacrifice the marked stone and seize the corner]
;W[qh];B[ph];W[pg];B[pn]C[zergs : Is that a good idea, or should I attack more the white group ?

Ghost : This makes territory.  The white group is safe now. Black has to be happy with the situation. It could have gotten much worse should white had more heavily attacked the corner. Problem is the white end up in sente again.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[dj]C[Ghost : as a consequence of having taken sente, white took two big points in a row, and black could not do a thing. All this is the consequence of black R10. Now White's moyo is huge. Black has to invade. 'a', 'b' and 'c' are possible]
;B[no]LB[nf:a]C[zergs : I tried to build a moyo is this too passif ?

Ghost : building moyo is good, except if your opponent already has a bigger moyo than you. Besides this was not really a moyo building move. 'a' would be better to build moyo. Like I said earlier, invading is the only possiblity. The move just played reinforces White and enables him to make territory.]
;W[mp]C[Ghost : White has a lot of cash now...];B[np]C[Ghost : this does not have any other effect than reinforcing white and make it more difficult for black in the future. invading is urgent.]
;W[mq];B[mo]C[Ghost : very very slow. it gives white sente. white has a big moyo already, so white 'll invade]
;W[lc]TR[ic]MA[fc][fd][ed]C[zergs : Ok should I react here, is this an overplay ?

Ghost : this is a correct invasion. whatever you do, it won't be really good for you.  It is due to the fact that the triange marked stone is too close the the crossed stone. Also, black's corner is under attack now.]
;B[mc];W[ld];B[nf]C[Ghost : Good sequence for Black. This closes the corner territory, makes black get out and attacks both groups of white stones at the top and on the righ sides.]
;W[oe];B[ne];W[oc];B[od];W[mb];B[nc];W[nb];B[ob]C[Ghost : white played small moves, and the situation has not changed. White's both groups are under attack, black can get out and the corner is safe. Moreover, white's right group is sealed and has to live.]
;W[rg]C[Ghost : this makes life];B[re]LB[kb:a][jj:b]C[Ghost : this is really slow, sure it forces white to play to get life, but it's slow]
;W[ri]LB[sl:a][rj:b]C[Ghost : life now, and due to the low position of the marked stone, black right territory has been potentially greatly reduced due to the possibility of a monkey jum at 'a'. Therefore sooner or later, black will have to defend at 'b' and white  will take sente again.]
;B[lf]C[Ghost sure enough this attacks white (like 'a'), but there were bigger point. 'b' creates a huge moyo and there is still the bottom right invasions that are becoming urgent. Now, as white will get out, the black stones on the left will get under attack]
;W[jd];B[id];W[je];B[ie];W[jb]C[Ghost : White livesand black's group in in danger. Black can make a big moyo by playing in the center. Invading the bottom is also urgent.]
;B[jc];W[kc];B[jf]C[Ghost : black just reinforces white. there are bigger points o bord]
;W[ib];B[le]C[Ghost : this is slow...  Black has just lost the top territory, and for nothing.]
;W[hb];B[fb];W[fq]C[Ghost : It will be a lot more difficult to invade now....]
;B[dm]C[Ghost : this is a little late....];W[cl];B[fm];W[co]
LB[cq:a][cp:b]C[Ghost : Black creates himself a weak group and reinforces white who makes territory. Black would profit a lot of studying the 3-3 and 3-4 invasions('a' and 'b')]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[dl]LB[jn:a][hj:b]C[Ghost : that accomplishes nothing. White 's territory is now secure and black has a group that won't make any territory.'a' and 'b' to build moyos were better]
;W[jm]LB[ng:a]C[Ghost : White sure enough invades. 'a' will still be playable in the future]
;B[ko];W[kp];B[jo];W[io];B[in];W[ho];B[hm];W[ej];B[gj];W[ij]
C[Ghost : the game is now simple. White lives inside, he wins, if he dies black wins. However, there is much room to live.]
;B[gk]LB[hk:a]C[Ghost : slow.'a' was better];W[ln];B[lo]C[Ghost : White is creating volume for eyes and life]
;W[ll];B[il];W[lj];B[jk];W[kk];B[jj];W[nk];B[kj];W[jl]C[Ghost : White is alive. the game is finished]
;B[ik]C[Ghost : and White also takes sente... what's left is to destroy black's territory]
;W[li];B[mm];W[lm];B[ml];W[mk];B[ol];W[ni];B[ok]LB[dg:a][ca:b]
[fo:c][qr:d][rj:e]C[Ghost : this serves no pupose. A big point is 'a' and 'b'. 'c' is smaller, but very sente. 'd' is also big now and 'e', but 'e' is gote]
;W[nh];B[nj];W[mj];B[oj];W[og];B[dd]C[zergs : ok this was bad, what would have been better ?

Ghost : the points evoqued earlier are big, but the damage is already done at this stage. Most of the mistakes were ealier, the mistakes now are just the consequences of difficult positions.]
;W[ce];B[dh];W[dg];B[eh];W[ch];B[eg]C[zergs : well the game is lost here thanks for the comments]
