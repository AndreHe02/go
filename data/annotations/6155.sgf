C[hello!
this game is usefull for the understanding of parallel fuseki, then i just underline the global vision of goban]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd]TR[jb][jd][jf][jh][jj][jl][jn][jp][jr]
C[this is a parallel opening, then the goban is divided in two like this

as the purpose of the game is to get a major part of goban, at this moment a simple move  could be to play in the half part of the opponent]

(;B[kc]TR[jb][jd][jf][jh][jj]C[l17 is inside the black half, then black does not makes full use of the 5th move]

(;W[cm];B[lp]TR[jb][jd][jf][jn][jp][jr]C[we can say the same for m4]
;W[pj]LB[pd:1]TR[jg][ji][jk][jm]C[then it is white the first to invade the other part

this means that black lost his privilege of the first move on the goban, privilege compensate by komi]

(;B[hd];W[gm];B[hp]TR[jb][jd][jf][jn][jp][jr]SQ[hd]C[according to the same idea h16 and h4 are good moves

we can just try to understand if they are deep enough into white half part

please look at the possible variation i propose and compare the results]
