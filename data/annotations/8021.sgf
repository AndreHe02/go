C[Hello dear reviewer,

I played this game for the "Trollnament" VIth edition. I got lucky in the end and won the game, but I felt overwhelmed all along and would have surely lost. Can you point my biggest mistakes in the opening and during the fuseki ?

Thanks for all advice you will give !];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
;B[fq];W[ip];B[fo];W[cn];B[lp]C[Aggresive, I usually play it in handicap games.]
;W[po]TR[ip]C[Makes black strong on the bottom to attack the marked stone, but should be quite playable as long as you can use it efficiently.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[ql];B[in]LB[ko:A]TR[hn][jn]
C[A is ok on the first look, but as it leans on strong stones, it's inefficient. You need to aim at one of the attachments. The stone must be used to split black, otherwise it's only a burden.]

He made a bad mistake, but still, you stood quite well against a 2d. Would be a good game even had you lost. So don't worry :)]
