C[Hello GTL, I have added some comments to the game the are in the format.
TheKid: <comment>

Regards,
Ramon


erker: Hi, Ramon. I will do the review.

It is a nice game.
But you missed an opportunity in the lower right corner and neglected your week group at the right. As a result, Black was able to build a moyo at the bottom that troubled you the rest of the game.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[od];W[qj]C[erker: Good.

This move prevents a big double purpose move (extension from below and above).]
;B[fc];W[ic]LB[cc:A][kc:B][lc:C][id:D][cf:F][df:E]C[erker: I don't like this move, but maybe it's just me.

Black has at least two options: jumping in the corner (A) or playing a counter pincer at B or C.
The latter is a nice double purpose move (pincer and extension), and if Black chooses A, the white stone (j17) is not in the perfect position to built a wall (D would be better).

So maybe it's just easier to play at E or F instead the marked white stone.]
;B[cc];W[dc]LB[kc:D][cd:A][qh:C][cj:B]TR[ic]C[TheKid:  I thought this was the correct direction since I could use influence in that direction to reduce his potentional territory in the upper right.


erker: This is correct, but I think for a different reason.

d17 is right, because blocking at the other side at A is not very attractive: The marked white stone is a bit away and there is no white stone around B.
As a result, if you build a wall by blocking at A, the wall's influence would be immediately nullified by a Black play at B.

But if you play at d17, the black corner group is moving downward along the left side. This means that the Black corner group will limit the value of a White move played around B (extension from the lower left corner). 

So d17 is clearly better than A, but both are not optimal. That is the reason I don't like the marked white stone (j17).

I also think you overestimate the influence of the white wall you are building in the corner. Imagine a black stone at C or D: it's not likely that the influence of the white corner group will help much in either case.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[mc]LB[id:A]TR[ic]
C[erker: Your top group is a bit flat.

It would be better balanced if you had played the marked stone at A.]
;B[nc];W[md]TR[fc][qj]C[TheKid: at this point I think Im ahead.

erker: I would say it's even or slightly in Black's favour.

The two bottom corners are almost even. (The black corner is limited by the marked white stone and the white corner is limited by the black upper left corner, but White gets the better end.)
The upper left corner gives 10+ secure points, the upper right is around 15 points. So Black has around 25 points. 
Around 25 points is also the value of the white moyo at the top.
The black upper right corner is not secure territory, but so is the white moyo at the top: the marked black stone is not completely immobilized; if it starts moving it will eliminate half of White's potential territory. 

So, your are not ahead in terms of territory. What about influence? I think White's is a bit better, but not much. And it's Black turn.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[qq]LB[qo:A][qp:B]
C[erker: Good.

Black chooses this joseki to turn the bottom into black territory (maybe expecting White A, Black B).
So it is good for White to jump into the corner and preventing this.]

(;B[qp]LB[qo:A][pq:B]C[erker: This Black move is wrong (see my comment on your next move and the variation).
The usual answers to White's move are A and B.]
(;W[rm]LB[qg:B][pq:A]TR[qj][pm][on][pn][qn]C[erker: This is a missed opportunity.

Black has made a mistake, so you should punish him and play the normal 3-3-Point invasion sequence  (at A; see variation). After this sequence, the two marked black stones will look really, really stupid.

If you don't like to take the corner then there is no point in playing at 3-3 in the first place.

Maybe you were afraid of your 3 marked stones on the right? Then play at B (instead of s7), but first take the corner.]
;B[pq];W[dr];B[eq];W[dq];B[gp];W[cj]LB[qg:C][qh:D][ck:A][cl:B]
C[erker: Locally, I would prefer A.

The reason is that if after a Black invasion (at B) the White stone gets isolated from the corner group, there is not enough room to form a secure base.


But globally, I opt for C.

So let's compare White A (our your move) and White C in terms of territory, attack, defence, sente/gote and influence.

On the left, both Black's and White's corner are low, so it's not likely that either side can gain much territory. On the right, Black is hight, so it's more valuable for Black to play here and hence for White to prevent this.

Both left corner groups are rock solid; so there is no point attacking them nor preventing an attack. Therefore, a Black or a White move around c10 will be gote.

White at C will not directly thread the corner, so it's not a direct attacking move and likely gote. But it prepares for an attack later.
A Black move at D will reduce the bad aji of the corner and it attacks the white group or at least prepares for it. Probably, it's sente.

So playing at the left and playing at the right are almost equal in direct territory.
On the left, that's it -- it's a single purpose move.
But playing on the right also prevents territory for the opponent, attacks, and defends. It's a multi purpose move.

Since both the left corner groups and both the top and bottom groups are more or less secure, playing around c10 will not result in much influence. But the Black attack at D allows Black to press at the right white group a few moves later and thus creating influence toward the bottom.]
;B[qh]C[erker: And so the trouble starts...

Black is attacking your group and as a result expands his moyo at the bottom.]
;W[oj];B[pk];W[pj];B[om];W[pl];B[ol];W[qk]LB[ok:A]TR[pk]C[erker: Should be at A.

The marked black stone can not escape and a white stone at A gives better influence toward the center.]
;B[jl]C[TheKid: At this point I know I have to reduce the lower side, but I have no idea how to start.  I fact I was thinking about this before this point, but did not know how to prepare for this move(k8).


erker: Now it is a bit late to worry about reducing the lower side.
But the bottom is open at the left, so it isn't as big as it looks. (But still it's big.)]
;W[qf]C[erker: Locally, this is OK, since you're strong.
But is this the right time?

Let's count. Upper left and upper right corner are 10 and 15 points, resp.  The white moyo at the top is around 25 points.
The black extension at the right (before you invaded it) is around 10, so is the right white group.
The left white group may yield 25 points, but the black moyo is around 50.

So your are around 25 points behind.
Even if your succeed in destroying 10 of Black's points at the right but loose sente, it will not be enough.]
;B[rf];W[qg];B[rg];W[ph]LB[nf:A]TR[qf][qg]C[erker: To small.

The two marked stones served their purpose: they flattened the Black right site.
So there is no reason to loose sente to connect them with the wall.

If you must play in this area, then play at A, as it at least expands your top moyo.

But it's better to reduce the bottom, expand the top or expand the left.]
;B[fm];W[fn]C[erker: This move only helps Black.

After your weak right group helped Black to build the right wall of his moyo you are now helping Black to build the left wall.
You can not expect to secure some points in this area, so you are helping Black for free.

So either reduce it now (and not after the wall is complete).
Or you can try to press from above to build something of your own in the upper center.]
;B[gn];W[fo];B[fk];W[mk]LB[ll:A]C[erker: Maybe better at A, but that depends on your strategy (reducing Black or building something in the upper center?).]
;B[ll];W[ml];B[mm];W[nm];B[mn];W[nn]C[erker: Overplay, as Black can cut and capture.]
;B[no];W[nl];B[mo];W[mq]C[erker: Overplay.

There is no way White can live on his own. Since the black stones are more or less connected, you also can't live by capturing something.]
;B[lq];W[oo];B[op];W[qo];B[po];W[rp]C[erker: This is an endgame move as both the black and white group are secure.

Black can ignore your move (loosing some points in the corner) and play at the top reducing your moyo, or invade the left.]
;B[rq];W[ro]LB[rn:A][sp:B]C[erker: Same remarks as for Move 72.

This is not sente, so don't play it. It's also not sente for Black (Black s5, White A, Black B).]
;B[qr]C[erker: Lucky you.];W[lr];B[kq];W[jr]LB[go:C][er:A][gs:B]
C[erker: Black can play at A, because there is still no way to live as White.

Therefore, White should play at B (or C) instead.];B[kr];W[gs]
;B[fs];W[fr];B[gr];W[es];B[hr];W[hs];B[is];W[fs];B[ir];W[go]
;B[ho];W[em];B[gm];W[ce]LB[be:A][bh:C][ch:B]C[erker: Don't do that.

Black will not play at c15 in the near future, because it's absolutely gote.
This means it is not urgent for you to play it now.

But there are three reasons not to play it: You loose one liberty, you loose one very nice ko threat, and you loose the possibility to play at A (imagine a white stone at B or C later in the game).
So later, without the exchange White c15 for Black A, a White move played at B or C will be sente.]
;B[be];W[df];B[cg];W[if]LB[nb:A][ih:C][ji:B]C[erker: Good, but not enough.

It's good, because you need to gain some points and this is the right area to do so.

But is it enough? Let's count.

The upper left black corner more or less equals the White's group on the right.

Your lower left is 25 points and Black's bottom group 50 points.
What's the value of the upper right group? If Black manages to play at A, it's 20 points, otherwise it depends on your success reducing it.

So you need to get 45 points from your upper moyo.

But consider the sequence given in the variation: Even if Black don't get any new points in the center, he reduces the white moyo to 30 points and secures the corner. His lead will be 15 points.

Therefore, you need something fancier, out of the ordinary like B or C and try to get some points out of the upper right center too.]

(;B[ih];W[hh]LB[hg:A]TR[fc]C[erker: That is a bit risky.

If Black hanes at A, the aji of the marked black stone springs to life.]

;B[kf];W[jk];B[ik];W[kl];B[km];W[kk];B[jm];W[lm];B[ln]C[TheKid: While I know this is not a good way to reduce his territory, at this point I thought I was back in a good position.


erker: As Black is super strong in this area, there is not much you can do about it.]
;W[jf];B[jg];W[ke];B[lf];W[re];B[qe];W[pc];B[oc];W[qc];B[rd]
;W[rc];B[pb];W[pd];B[pe];W[oe];B[pg]LB[rb:A]C[erker: Black at A instead will capture the corner.

So it wasn't a good idea to invade the corner in the first place. But on the other hand, you are behind so there is nothing to loose.]

;B[lc];W[kb]LB[lb:A]C[erker: Better at A.

There is nothing to fear.];B[lb];W[ma];B[sh];W[sj];B[sd];W[ea]
LB[ca:A][bc:B]C[erker: This is gote without gaining anything.

Black can not omit to defend at B (Black A, White e19, Black elsewhere, White B will capture the corner). So playing at A as White later (Move 222) will not gain a point, only destroy a ko thread.
