C[Cologne Tournament 2003
60 Minutes Time + 15/5 progressive byoyomi.];B[pc];W[dp];B[qp]

C[Nothing to be said till now : this fuséki seems quite normal. I like the idea to developp quickly with 13]
;W[cf]LB[dk:a][cl:b]C[W14 : may be usual move is arround  "a" or "b"]
;B[ci]C[B15 :look nice];W[fc];B[fd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cc];B[en]
LB[gc:a]C[B 21 : nice move. Almost senté and Black can handle White escaping at "a".  But I think I will play at "a" instead]
;W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[ob];W[qh];B[md]LB[gc:a]C[B 27 : Can be played at "a"]
;W[co]LB[fp:a]C[W28 : simply playing at "a" is better];B[fp]
C[B6 seemed too submissive to me.
JH : A bit submissive but playable too. If black can take sente to put one more move on the upper side, he wil be well in the game;]
;W[eo]C[W30 : White try a fight but it is not an easy fight for him.]
;B[fn]LB[fo:a]C[I think playing at "a" is stronger];W[fo];B[go]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[do];B[hn]LB[gn:a]C[B37 : the solid connexion at "a" is better. Anyway White is bad.]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[bn];B[eg]LB[dh:a][dl:b]C[B41: I don't like this move as Black has a bad defect of shape at "a". Simply connecting at "b" is enough]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[ge]
(;B[df]LB[cg:a][gc:b]C[I wanted sente.
Is the hane at G14 better?
JH : B45 is not good because you obliged White to play a good move at 46 G14 is one possibility. What about "a" or "b"?]
;W[cg];B[ic]LB[jc:a]C[B 47 : may be too close from white; better one line on the right at "a"]
;W[gc];B[eb]LB[db:a]C[B49 is better at "a"];W[jd];B[id];W[ie]

(;B[jc]C[Now I think the cut might be better, especially because J18 enables the connection at F19.
JH : Cutting is possible also.];W[je];B[kd];W[ff]
(;B[ef]C[D15 for sente?
JH : D15 theaten the corner and was better];W[gh];B[fh]C[Not good : just jump at "a" seems good shape]
;W[gi];B[gg];W[hg];B[ei]C[I feared D12.
N63 is OK.];W[kc];B[lc]LB[kb:a]C[May be you should punish White by playing at "a"]
;W[kb];B[jb]C[Instead L15 perhaps?
Not so much better. The cut is not so good for White];W[ke]
;B[ld];W[mf]C[The result is not bad for white in this region.]
;B[bh];W[ce]LB[bg:a]C[W 72 : better at "a"];B[ba]C[Too early PERHAPS;]
;W[bb];B[ca];W[da];B[db];W[cb];B[ea];W[bg];B[hr]LB[dl:a]C[I planned D2 later.
JH  : I canot say it is bad but it is time to cover some defects like "a".]
;W[jr];B[nf]LB[dl:a]C[B 83 : not sur this point is good. Connecting at "a" is big.]
;W[mg];B[of];W[pg];B[me];W[le]LB[dl:a]C[Strange move. White can take the lead by cutting at "a"]
;B[dl];W[ql];B[qj]C[B 91 looks overplay];W[pk];B[nh];W[pj];B[ph]
;W[oh];B[ng];W[oi]C[Seems too cautious.];B[li];W[kh];B[fg];W[gf]
;B[ki];W[jh];B[lh];W[ji];B[lg];W[kf]C[W 108 : a strange move: connecting is clearly better.]
;B[dr];W[fq]LB[cr:a]C[W 110 : better at "a" to keep some points]
;B[gq];W[eq];B[fr];W[er]LB[cr:a]C[114 a bad move : should be played at "a"]
;B[es];W[cq];B[gj];W[hj];B[gk];W[rm];B[rb];W[rd]LB[bl:a]C[122 : bigger at "a"]
;B[br]C[Big !!];W[cr];B[cs];W[bq];B[bm];W[cn];B[bl];W[bs];B[as]
;W[aq];B[ds];W[ar];B[bs];W[bp];B[nr];W[mr];B[or];W[so];B[rp]
C[Is M2 better? Seems more sente to me.];W[sp];B[sq];W[rn];B[ro]
;W[sn];B[rr];W[om]LB[ee:a]C[Not so big : White can take 2 stones in sente with "a" first]
;B[on];W[nn];B[qm];W[rl]C[End of recording. At last I lost with 3.5 points.
JH : It seems that white is a little better in the game even if he played a terrible yosé in the SW corner !!]
