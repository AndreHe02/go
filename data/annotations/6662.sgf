;B[ld]C[cpc [4k\]: i have really bad lag];W[id]C[I am not sure pincering is valid or rather a move starting from P16 like attaching at R17 would be better.

Theres alot of optiopns here u can look them up in something like kogos dictionary, i would assume a pincer could be possible if m16 was in a diffrent spot, but this starts a fight u wont, black attaching is a bad move.]
;B[oe]
(;W[ne]C[Again, would R17 or hane on the other side be better?
this is bad cant play this way w is in a weaker position you must yield to black.]

(;W[qc]C[Would R15 also safely capture the corner?  Is something loose like R14 even better?

i like here too, other then those 2 moves dont c much else.]
;B[pf];W[qe];B[qf]
(;W[ok]C[This is a key move.  Should I have just played in the bottom or left?  If I was intent on reducing/approaching, was P9 a good place or would Q8 be better?

wrong direction completly if black goes for big pts u do too]
;B[pm]C[hes given u something this way]
(;W[om]C[I am not sure where this should be....
veyr bad idea make blakc stronger fopr no reason];B[pn];W[qj]

very bad get away form black way too strong];B[pk]C[i dont know what to say??? leave there alone]

;W[lh]C[Am I already doomed here?];B[mh];W[kh];B[jj];W[qh]C[Is there any way to live at this point?]
;B[oh]C[i know how hard it is to understand direction, its what got me from the 2k to 2d range, but its really important to know when to invaded knowing how iis for stronger players then me, you gave black many stones handicap by someing in way too close, dont worry about reduceing if black plays chinese try and build yourself your only 1 move behind when it come down to it both of you will have huge moyos and try it that way.
or of course fight distantly and lightly not every stone is important :)

good luck in future games hope this review helps.])
