AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, my name is Jim.  I started playing Go in 2006 but these days I play about a few games every two weeks.  I live in Japan and I play against tough old men who love Go (haha).  I guess I'm about 7k on KGS, though I haven't logged in for a long time.  I'm about 2k here in Japan.  Anyway, the problem here is that you don't protect your stones enough, and you spread them too thin.  You were lucky that your opponent didn't see your weakness at many points.]
