C[Thank you for your review!

Basically, in this game, I tried to make it interesting and try a few risky things.]

;B[op];W[oo];B[no];W[po];B[dn]C[This feels premature of me, should I of finished the bottom right first?


[R\]: yes, you should.  If white initiates an exchange starts from O4, black is worse off. 

a joseki is a sequence of moves that end up with equal benefits for both side locally. So unless you are absolutely sure you are getting that much benefit by tenuki, you shouldn't just leave an unfinished battle.]

(;W[cn]C[[R\]: D6 exchanges for C6 is good for white as he can naturally solidify his group and you've just removed the possibility of invading that part later on.]
;B[np];W[qi]TR[cj]C[[R\]: again, that D6 move also removed the possibility of invading at the triangle marked area as white is more or less stable on both upper and lower left.]
;B[od];W[qf];B[on]TR[lc][df][pg]C[[R\]: this move is too slow - surely you can find better moves 

the upper side for example 

all the marked triangle spots are possible move that are a bit faster than the one u've just made.

and I'm sure there are a lot more good moves if you look carefully.]
;W[pm]
(;B[pn]C[[R\]: this push is a bad move. not only allow white to naturally solidify his territory and remove all possible aji in that area, you're also creating weakness for yourself.]
;W[qn];B[pp];W[qo];B[jp];W[kc];B[mc];W[hc];B[bd];W[be];B[cd]
;W[fb];B[gc]C[[R\]: this is a bad move. Again, you're solidifying white without a clear view of your own gain in the process.]
;W[gb];B[hd];W[ic];B[dj];W[cj];B[ck];W[dk];B[ci]C[[R\]: you should spend more time to read during fighting]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[di]C[here I decided to do the more interesting of two evils.

[R\]: infighting require at least some reading ahead, your choice is just plain bad.]

(;B[bk];W[ej];B[aj];W[dj];B[bh];W[cg];B[bg];W[bf];B[dh]C[Premature? Should I of played C7 or something first?

[R\]: this stone doesn't do anything, doesn't really matter if you play it or not. Same thing for C7 - your group is beyond salvation I'm afraid :)]
;W[ag];B[cm];W[dm];B[dg];W[cf];B[bm];W[do];B[en];W[bn];B[eo]
C[Here I start to see that my invasion failed, so I try for ouside wall for compensation, the wall to give me a bottom moyo perhaps.]

(;W[am]C[[R\]: this move is not needed];B[ef];W[om]C[This feels big, it feels like my previous choice of the Q6 sequence was poor.

[R\]: yes it was a poor judgement, please see the alternate sequence I made back then.]
;B[nn];W[of];B[nm];W[nl]C[[];B[ol]C[Again, the more interesting option. I think this is better for me as it allows me to make N8 more naturally, and feels less submissive when I make it.

[R\]: your idea is good, keeping sente by sacrificing 1 stone. However this can lead to complicated fighting in white's favour.]

(;W[ql];B[ml];W[nk];B[mk];W[nj];B[pe]TR[fl]C[[R\]: this is another wasted move.  the marked triangle is probably the biggest move for black right now. 

once again, you're solidifying white while gaining nothing in return.]
;W[im]C[The seemed to me to be a little too deep. 

[R\]: it's not too deep, white has quite a few way to escape and depends on how your attack follows, white might gain some land and influence in the middle while attacking your top left group]
;B[gm];W[gl];B[hm];W[hl];B[il];W[fm];B[fn];W[kl];B[fl]C[This ended up not good enough for me, ended up gote.]
;W[fk];B[em]

[R\]: overall, you play a very adventurous style :) while fun and you can learn a lot from those mistakes but I think you should be more conservative in your approach. 

One can only be fancy once his foundation is rock solid. 

Secondly, I think you took one too many risks without some, however little, reading to back it up. 

Somehow I have a feeling that you lack objective/direction. If you are playing a moyo game, you should try to build a moyo bigger than your opponents. Don't go for petty moves.

I think you know this already. Go is a game where 2 players put down the same number of stones. If your stones are more efficient/valuable than your opponents, you will win. It's that simple. 

if you stop to evaluate options - choose the one that you think yields the biggest result and back it up with some reading. I'm sure you can improve in no time. 

Goodluck, it's been a pleasure :)])

(;B[qq]C[[R\]: how about this? white will have difficulty in finding a good answer. Black will be that much stronger and it will be that much harder for white to decide when to invade the bottom. 

the draw back is that black might end in gote in this sequence and white's that much stronger in that area as well.]

(;W[np]C[[R\]: it might be better for black if you leave some aji behind 

but as you might know already, winning or losing depends on the value of each stone you put down. Anyway you look at it, you've wasted a few moves on the bottom right with this exchange.]

(;B[mp];W[nq];B[cn]C[[R\]: this is too good for white since your few stones down lower right become very weak and while they can still serve some purpose, overall it's not good at all.]
