C[
Dear reviewer,

this is a game I recently played on the internet. I believe it is both a close game and representative of my playing style. During the opening and early middle game I felt quite comfortable, but was unable to transform it into a victory. I believe in the end I even manage to catch up a little bit and lose by 2.5 points. My own remarks are marked with AB.


* Hi there! I'm mafutrct, your reviewer. My comments will start with an asterisk*.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[ce];W[dp];B[cn];W[fp];B[dj];W[ec]LB[cc:A][dc:B]
[ec:C][ed:D]C[AB: I often play this move as I find it avoids complicated josekis and makes miai between C17 and H17.

* Indeed this is often seen as the easiest move out of A-D. You usually play it when the other moves end poorly, in particular when the top side is important. I don't think that's the case here, I think B or D are fine. Anyway, your C is only a slight mistake if any.]
;B[cc];W[ic]LB[ec:A][ic:B]
(;B[kc]LB[gc:A][kc:B]C[* B instead of A is ok, but it goes too easy on white.]

(;W[ie];B[ke];W[ee]C[* Funny shape :)];B[dg]C[* Ok so b gained a rather solid left side plus useful stones on the top side. White is not weak, but not strong either, and used a whole four stones. I would say black gained here.]
;W[qf];B[qd]C[* Good move!];W[pj]LB[qi:A]TR[cc][pd][qd][ce]
SQ[ic]C[* Again, black is solid in the corner, and white did not chose the solid extension, but a fast extension without a base. It is inconsistent, and while not losing much, it gives black more than he should get. I would recommend A instead.]
;B[pk]C[AB: Unusual, I thought.

* I have no idea why black is doing this. I cannot imagine a plan that would make this a good move. This simply helps white.]

(;W[qj];B[ok]LB[qj:A][qk:B]C[* Now, it looks as if black played a shoulder hit on a white third line stone. That is not very good for black, but it is less bad than if white had played hane (A at B).]
;W[qk];B[ql]
(;W[rl]LB[qm:A][qn:B][hq:C]C[* Do not lower your head here! We hate doing that unless we must!

* Instead A, black may consider B or C, but A should be fine.]
;B[qm];W[om]
(;B[pl]LB[ol:A][pm:B]C[* This move is not allowed. At least A or B instead. We only ever play this move if a ko is looming or we need to conserve libs.]
;W[np]C[AB: I think this sequence went quite well for me.

* Indeed, you made a small mistake at S8, but black made a bunch of mistakes and his initial move was very bad.]
;B[jq]
(;W[hq]
(;B[lq];W[nq];B[kn];W[mm]C[AB: Now I think the game is good for me. Black has two weak groups and I should benefit from that.

* Yes];B[oj];W[cl]LB[of:A][cl:D][kl:B][in:C][cq:E]C[AB: I couldn't find a suitable attack so I decided to take benefits elsewhere.

* I recommend a soft attack at A, or a solid split at B.

* If you're adventurous, white C is thinkable. White is very thick in this area, and black is pretty thin, so he must be very careful not to get cut after C. If black moves out solidly, white should gain good shape and continue splitting the two black groups.

* D and E are kind of miai. But I don't really like either of them.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[bp]
(;W[dq]C[* Wrong direction! The lower side is very limited after H3, so white MUST take the outside.]
;B[br];W[cr];B[bq]
(;W[el]C[AB: Still feeling good...];B[kl]
(;W[mk]LB[nl:A][nn:B]C[* This shape is not very good, because of the combined peeps at A and B.]
;B[oi]LB[pg:B][ph:A][qh:C]C[* A B or C? Neither looks great to me]

(;W[ph];B[oh]C[* natural move by black];W[pg]LB[nf:A]C[* white does not like being forced to play this, but what can he do...]

(;B[lj]C[* This move is ok];W[nf]C[AB: I planned to either do something on the upper side or separate the two Black groups.

* good];B[md]LB[rc:B][me:A]C[AB: Maybe O16 would have been better for Black?

* I would have played A, but it leaves aji at B. The game move looks ok, though the shape is pretty strange]
;W[mj]
(;B[mi]C[* Too early, does not make full use of the P12 stone and the P13 sente]
;W[li]C[AB: I felt I had to cut now.

* right];B[mh];W[kk]
(;B[jl]
(;W[lk]C[AB: Was that the good sequence?

* both players did not use the full potential]
(;B[io];W[hl]LB[mr:A]C[AB: Again a little unsure here. The group at the bottom is not so weak.

* this direction does not make much sense. what is white trying to gain here?

* if unsure, play yose e.g. at A to keep black somewhat weak while gaining points]

(;B[lo];W[lf];B[lh];W[ch]C[AB: Now that both Black groups are not really weak I decided to take profit elsewhere again.]

[ss]C[AB: In the end Black wins by 2.5 points. I really enjoyed playing this game, but just didn't have enough points in the end :-). Thank you for your comments!

* It was a good game. A few strange moves, but almost no big mistakes. I'm not good at yose, so I'm sorry I could not give better comments especially in the second half of the game.

* It feels like this game was very difficult to play as either player, often there were several options and it was difficult to pick the right one, as the differences between the options would show up only late.

* In the opening, you should try to play more solidly when your opponent plays tightly. In the game, you did not get punished for that at all, but a better player would probably have bullied your or made you forfeit points.

* The game was dominated by the somewhat-but-not-quite weak black groups. It was difficult to attack them, but ignoring them was not easy either. Very tough situation. I prefer to not let it come to this by chosing different directions early.

* Either player should also have focussed a bit more on the corners and side territory - in the game, it was to easy to grab and keep it for both. There should have been more fighting for points and good yose later.

* I hope this review was helpful to you (and that I did not make mistakes in my comments). Have a good time!]
