C[Hi, and thanks for reviewing. Think this is an interresting game. At least its not very standard.

I analyzed it myself for quite a bit and I think it was pretty much lost on move 22 where my opponent made a strong move and I made a big mistake.

At move 83 I made another huge mistake and I essentially gave sente away. From that point I made my own variation, the what if I hadnt made this mistake.

My opponent is mommommom, think its not his real name, im not sure about his rank. Could be between 1D and 6D.

My rank is probably 1 to 2D

[kb\]: Hi,

This is not the best kind of game to send to the GTL, especially since there is not much you can do to win after your early mistake.  Please find a closer game next time.

Regardless, I will try my best ;)];B[qc]C[I used to evaluate my moves

but of course statistics are a bit irrelevant. Still it seems that the 3x3 move statistically speaking is a bad move... Anyway.

statistic for the next move
a 44.4% (9) b 60% (5)
c 30% (10) d 40% (5)
e 25% (4) f 0% (2)
g 14.3% (7) h 0% (1)

The only move I really wouldnt play is H, but the rest seems perfectly playable. Anyways...

[kb\]: You are right about "irrelevant" - generally, us amateurs will have very little chance of capitalizing on the win percentage of such statistics.

Concentrate more on playing what you think is the right move, finding good shape, and anticipating getting the last big fuseki point.]
(;B[cj]LB[kd:D][ce:B][cf:A][ch:C][cm:E]C[In 41 games either A till H is played, but b move is not. (see previous move)

To all probability mommommom is a stronger player than me (although he says he is 2k to 7k), and if I were a strong player I would probably do the same. Place your opponent for a difficult question and prevent a conventional game development.

So for what would have been my next best move I went to the side fuseki pattern from http://kgs.fuseki.info/

Statistic for the next move
a 50% (8) b 50% (6)
c 100% (2) d 100% (1)
e 0% (1)
Tenuki (pass): 5 variations

[kb\]: The large knight's enclosure from the top is a standard way to play here, and my preferred move as White (basically following your continuation).]
(;W[ch]C[probably this is a bit too agressive

[kb\]: It's much too close.]
(;B[cm]C[but again b just make a 2 point extension and there are zero games played this way, or there is no help from the side pattern fuseki from http://kgs.fuseki.info

[kb\]: ...that is why fuseki database searches help us little to improve.  If you rely on this for your advancement I fear you will hit a wall in your development.]

C[black now goes completely off the map with this weird approach move, or is it....

http://eidogo.com/#159Nnz:0,29

from eidogo it seems the low 2 point approach is standard...

The next moves I found from eidogo are A, B and C

A peacefull and most frequently played
B less peacefull
C rare move http://eidogo.com/#2JlNWy:0,42

[kb\]: A is fine.]

[hm][hn][ho][hp][hq][hr][hs]C[and I follow suit with this rather questionable move...

although there is one game in eidogo database where this pattern occurs (pattern inside triangles]
(;B[ek]LB[ej:A][ek:B][em:C]C[not sure why b play here and not at A, but there probably is some reason...

Searched for some time on internet but could not find anything about this kind of extension from a 2 space extension.
Maybe you could give some situation where B is better than A?

but B C exchange doesnt seem to help w much, E3 next seems slow...

[kb\]: B is a strange reply.  It doesn't have a great follow-up, and you can easily take the vital point in the future (or now really).]
;W[pn]C[not sure how to attack the b group on the left so approach the corner.

Now play the 2 space high aproach, mostly because it is less vulnerable to pincers, at least in theory

[kb\]: Take E3 first, then you can attack the Black group much easier (bottom and right corner are miai).]
(;B[qk]C[eidogo says this is not recommended. In fact many times Q6 is played when R9 and Q3 are already there...]

"It's the Internet!"  No, it's Go.  We don't hide behind the Internet.  Would you continue this game face-to-face?
