C[ This game was played between me and a friend of mine to whom I taught go. We have been playing  for nearly two months, and this is about our 7th match. As you can see, my friend has improved very quickly and played me evenly in this game.

At the moment I am 15k on KGS . As you go through the game, and based on our moves, could you estimate roughly what level you think my friend is? If you think he is about my level (after all, we played this game evenly), could you let me know if  this seemed to you a  15k level game? (I am not sure how stable my KGS ranking is)

Throughout the SGF I have made some comments and asked some specific questions. However, I would appreciate very much any general comments on tactics and strategy both for Black and White.

Thank you very much.

Brenno

Rex: Brenno & Justin, let me say that presently I am 9k on Dragon Go Server which is a turn-based playing site. I play rarely on KGS, but am probably 11 or 12k. Having said this, if you wish to resubmit this to GTL, then please do so, I will not be offended. Since you learn by reviewing, I will review your game anyway.

I just went through your game to get a feel for it. I first thought that Justin was weaker then 15k since he made some weak moves in the opening. Then however, he made up for it in the middle game, which made me think you both are of similar rank. So in the end, it seems to be Brenno is a bit stronger in the fuseki, with Justin being a bit stronger in the chuban.

I'm not good enough to judge accurately the level of this game. Don't worry though, on KGS it will even itself out when you play enough.]

;W[oi]C[Rex: I don't like this move. See variation.]
(;B[ql];W[ok]TR[oi][qj]C[Q: How efficient is this marked shape? White's opinion is that it works well in splitting the two black groups, as well as opening the way to the center.

Rex: The W marked formation is strong. However I would have played q10, which also keeps the center open, knowing B needed to defend 1 of the 2 right-side groups since the both are weak. When B defended 1 side, I'd attack the other.]
;B[cc]C[Rex: Very bad of B to tenuki (move elsewhere). The lower right B group is dangerously weak, not to mention the upper right B group. I believe W could profit very much from attacking either group. And if W works it right (come out with sente from 1 attack to attack the other side), he could attack both.]
;W[ed]LB[bd:X]C[Rex: I believe X is much better since it opens 2 attacks. The first would be to jump up into the corner, and the second would be to make a monkey jump to a13, attacking B's base.]

(;W[hd]C[Q: From move 44 to move 57 there is going to be a fight for the upper area of the board. How well did it go? Could you give suggestions/variations on it?

Rex: Very good for B, bad for W. Yes, W did secure life for his left top group and 6 points, but gave B a strong top group and 25 points. See variation from next move.

There's a go proverb, when you want to attack left, attack right first. W should've attacked the Bc11 group first, then invaded at the top. In attacking the B's c11 group, W will make his d16 group strong and not have to worry about it.]

Rex: No, it was not worth it. By connecting up, you gave W the chance, which he rightly took, of getting territory in the center. The question B needed to ask himself is if both groups can live on their own. If they can, do not connect, but take sente.]

(;W[fg]C[Q: if W had played D8 instead, would it win the capturing race? D8 was only played by black in the endgame (move 187).

(;W[qi]C[Rex: W should play p8 instead.];B[ol]C[Q: I had the impression that B won the game because of the endgame, starting here. Could it have turned out better for white? (Maybe D8 at any moment?)

Rex: W did very well in getting center territory. That is where he caught up. In order to make up about 15 points in the endgame, you need to be close to 1d. Remember this is under time pressure, so this makes it that much more difficult.]
