AB[pd][dp]C[A: I am an Israeli player, 2K on IGS.
Thank you for the opprotunity to review your game.

It was an interesting game and a very close one. 

I did not answer all your questions because in some cases the answer is not easy - I consider myself still as a beginner and I have a lot to learn before I state a definite opionion.

My comments will start with A: like this one.

You asked to mention the main 3 thing you should learn from this game - so here they are:
- You made severe mistakes in 'local fights'.  For example - move 64. You can improve your capabilities here by solving problems.

- You should improve your reading of the overall board. For example - move 38. This come with experience and analysis of your own games - may be with help of more experienced players.

- I also recommend you learn more about 'good' Shapes. For example - you lost the group in the botom right because it had bad shape. There is an excelent book on the net about shapes in www.gobase.org
by Charels Matthews - Look at the artciles section.

I hope it helps - I will be happy to get your feedback about this review.
Avi];W[dd];B[pq];W[qn];B[qp]C[A: Not a very good point. O4 is more natural - with potential for more territory and direction to link to D4.]

;W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[lo]C[A: This may be dangerous, because the group in the corner is not safe. In such a case, B should at least play P2 first.]
;W[or];B[pr];W[jo];B[lm];W[nm];B[jn]C[I am concerned about white building the right side, so I will try to settle my weak group by hitting the other side, and maybe making that group over concentrated.  What do think?

A: Seems to me OK.];W[in];B[jm];W[ko];B[mp];W[np];B[kn]C[A: A6 is better shape; W would not play L6 himself because then B plays L7 and has better position toward the center.]
;W[gn];B[rd];W[im]C[A: If B would have played M6 a few moves ago, then B could hanne here at J8.]
;B[jl];W[cd];B[ef];W[cl]
(;B[ck]C[Don't want him to live underneath.

A: Letting W live small underneath is better for B - he will have quite a big moyo in the center.]

;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[bp];B[el]C[I think I have a good result here with the left side for myself.

A: I would not be too happy as B. W managed to take the corner in an area that was dominated by B in the first place; and the W stones around C8 still have some aji that may help him to reduce the center.]
;W[lc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[me];B[md];W[ke];B[lf]C[I tried a severe attack.]
;W[jb]
(;B[kc]C[Bad shape, but I think it is good here.  What do you think?

A: I would play J18 - see the variant. The result in the game was that W gained too much territory on the left side, and aji o fthe 2 W stones on the right side.]
;W[kb];B[ic];W[ib];B[lb];W[hc];B[qh];W[re];B[pg];W[rc]C[He confused me here.]

(;B[qc]C[A: Unfortunately, B has to give up territory on the corner - because of the aji of the W M17 stones]
;W[sd];B[qd];W[pf];B[og];W[qb];B[rb];W[sb]C[I missed the ko.  I don't think I have alot of ko threats either.]
;B[sc];W[ro]C[A: W is in real danger];B[rp];W[rc];B[pb];W[ra]
;B[rj]C[He basically just has the upper left corner and this area.  I think I can win if I reduce this.]
;W[of];B[ng];W[qk];B[rl];W[rk];B[sk];W[ql];B[qj];W[rm]C[I thought this is tiny!!!]
;B[il]C[Going for the center.  Do you like it?

A: Looks good to me.];W[dh];B[dg]C[A: This seems to me wrong. G8 is much more important, especially when tehre is a bad aji of the D9 stone.]
;W[fh];B[gf];W[gl]C[A: Now it is realy difficult to prevent connection with the F12 stones, which is a big loss for B.]
