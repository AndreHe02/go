C[Hi Benjamin.
You lost your game, not because you have major tactical 
mistakes. Your major mistakes occured on the strategic level. In the opening you tried to make territory immediately. Instead you should have played on a great scale.
At first i think that it is important that you understand the 
meaning of your moves. Not only locally but also in context with 
the whole-board strategy. For this i will show you some 
alternatives.  
I made similar mistakes when i was a double digit kyu. The reason was that i often only look on the locol position. But it is also important to consider the whole board when you are thinking about your next move.]

;W[dc]
(;B[nq]CR[qo]LB[de:a][jp:b]C[This move is too slow.
Remember the star-point is used in the opening, when you want to play an influence-orientated game. 
Better follow-up-moves: A or B.
Further Explanations are in the variations.

The major meaning of your move is just saving territory, but you would need another stone on the position marked with the circle to save the entire corner perfectly.]
;W[ce]
(;B[pm]LB[jd:a][oc:b]C[Too slow again.
One objective in the opening is to install several groups in different areas of the board. Groups have different meanings:
"Making Territory" "Making Thickness<--> Strength and Influence" or "Destruction of potenzial territory of your opponent via Invasion or reduction." ( This list should not regarded as complete. :) )

But there is something to consider what is even more important: 
Has a group the POTENZIAL to make a stable position? In short: Is your group a weak group which means it is target for attack?

After White 6, you don't have weak group on the board.
With Black 7 you develope a group which is already stable on a small scale. That is something that you should avoid in the opening.
Instead you should try to establish a new outpost on the top side.

What is going on there?
White's corner enclosure on the left side has good follow-up-move around A. Another corner enclosure is probably also good for white.
You should always also ask yourself what is good for your opponents because this question can often give you a hint for your next move.

Now, please look on the variation.];W[dj];B[fq]C[The same mistake as explained before. The top side is much more important.]
;W[jq]
(;B[dm]TR[pm][ch][dh]LB[cn:a][cl:b]C[This move is better than the marked right move, but in consideration to whole board the value ist still too small.

The marked move only developes a group on a small scale. Black 11 has the same meaning. But in addition this move can be justified because it prevents White from getting the good move on
A. But for this task a move on B would give more pressure on White, because this move activates an invasion in the marked area.

But the top side is still more important at the moment. White A is a painful move, nevertheless the two black stones are not in danger. So it is not urgent to defend in this area.

Finally, perhaps the most important question: How to deal with White 10? This move was a bad overplay, because White has played deeply in black's sphere of influence ( moyo ) where it is not simple to build up a safe position.
Preventing your opponent from making a base is an urgent move. When you opponent is unable to stabilze the group there only two choices: Sacrifice the group or trying to run out in the center in order to safe the group. In the latter case you can attack the group. Killing the group is not neccessary. Usually you gain from your attacking moves because they don't only attack and often create new possibilties or solidify territroy.
Please look on the variations.];W[mr];B[mq];W[lr]
(;B[jp]LB[hq:a]C[On the strategic level: White has nothing done at the top, so the situation still calls for a black invasion. But White still isn't safe on the bottom, so this situation may be more important.

From a tactical view:
A contact play is usually a move that is used for defending.
Let's keep the things simple: Treat it as a life&death-problem.
The first thing that you try in a life & death-problems is to restrict the opponents eye-space that means that you restrict the place where he can build eyes. A move on A is simple and effectivly. It is also a good example for the principle "Make territory while attacking".
Look at the variations.];W[lq]
(;B[lp];W[ip]
(;B[ko]TR[jp]LB[jo:a][iq:b]C[Bad shape.
The marked stone has only two remaning liberties, so every next contact play is already an atari.
In such situations like this you have three choices:

1.Saving the stone->Just extend to A in order to increase the liberties. The diagonal connection you have pleayed ensures the connections but has the great disadvantage that black get the forcing move on A for free while you are ending up with the bad empty triangle.

2.Initiate a crosscut. But not appropriate in this case i think. Cross-cuts can be difficult. I have to admit that i have made many mistakes in order to get a little bit more familiar with their continuationss.
But in general you should keep this option in mind.

3. Just sacrifice the stone for the moment, when you think that there more important moves on the board.]
;W[jo];B[kp];W[io]TR[ko][kp][lp]SQ[iq][kq]C[Now you can already see why Black 15 was a bad move:
I marked the empty triangle.

But the last move was too greedy. The squares marked the weanesses in white position. Every cutting point is a potential weakness in a structure of stones.
When you have found a weakness you should at first look for another nearby weakness that can help you in exploiting a weak structure.
Many tesujis only work when you COMBINE several weaknesses.]

;W[hp];B[kn]TR[mo]LB[oc:a][od:b][jc:c]C[This move is not necessary, because you have already make a defensive move with the marked stone.
The upper side is still the most important are at the moment.
An invasion (C) or an approach move to the right corner (A or B) is the best move in my openion.]
;W[md]TR[cg][dg][dh][ch][kc]C[The game is already in favour for White.
All your stones are located at the bottom. They are overconcentrated->> Too many stones are located in the same area.

There is another famous proverb and principle that can help you to avoid overcentration:
Stay away from thickness<-->Stay from (your own and your opponents) strength.

But in this game the bad sequence was initiated by your attachment. An attachment provokes in most cases a hane or extending from the stone who was affected by the attachment. In both cases you srengthen your opponent, in fact the opposite of that what you want.

This last sequence should teach you:
Avoid attachments for attacking, but use attachments when YOUR group is weak and you need some defense.

Now Black has to fight hard.
But the shape of the wight stones is quite thin. I marked possible points where you could start probably an invasion.]
(;B[pf];W[qh];B[qi]LB[qj:a]C[Probably a move on A  better because your position is more stable after that.

An attachment is usually used when you have to defend or when usually invasion and reduction techniques don't work. Playing an attachment is usually inferior to a move like A.

When you are a single digit kyu, this point of view can change. :)]

The white stones at the top are working much more efficiently. Now, your best resistance would be an invasion at the top, but white has the advantage in this area.
You have should learn to things:

Before black 11 was played, on the left side there were two black stones, on the right side they were three black stones. Hence the right side was the stronger side.
Black 11 makes the weaker side stronger and drives white stones in direction of the strong black stones.

"Drive your opponent's stones in the direction of your thickness"

Why it is so big to install a group on the top?
1. The group destroys territory. Black prevents White from getting the whole top side.
2. Black divided White in two groups. Now White has to invest more stones in the game because two groups have to live instead of one.

I marked the influence generated from your thickness roughly with the circles. Influence means that you can fight with an advantage in this aread.
