;B[pp];W[qd];B[dp];W[cd];B[jp];W[jc]C[since C16 and R16 is far apart, the link  between 3 white stones is not strong, I prefer  R6 or C6 to approach corner or P17 or E17 to  protect corner.]

need not attachment. If black plays at R11,  the white group has no root.]

good idea for a split, after that you may try to  attack the upper black group. But ... , see  variation.]

(;W[jf]C[*She looks to connect her group, I make (an   uncharacteristic) strategy play to grab a hunk   of territory.


black has not connect the groups yet, you  may play at N13, make some weaknesses on  the black wall, and cut off black at suitable  time.

grabbing territory is quite passive, and black  can still cut into your territory.   black moyo is bigger, I prefer D6, which can  expand your moyo and shrink black moyo.]
;B[mg];W[oj]C[*And just as quickly go back on the attack.    (Maybe going under would have been              better?)


black is stronger than white in this area, you  cut and start a fight ... , hard to get a good  result. going under strengthen black's  thickness, not good also.

yes, it is very weak.

I think you need not strengthen the group on  the right since it is very strong already.

if you want to strengthen upper left moyo, E17  maybe better.

I prefer R3 to take the lower right corner, see  variation.]

you want to take the entire middle ... , difficult  to take the middle, and you have not  strengthen your moyo yet ( e.g., E17 ).

but still a good move, I think. If you play  anywhere else, black will attack white at H7.]
