(;B[cn]LB[jc:C][cl:B][cm:A][pp:D]C[[JD\] Here, I considered A-D instead of C6.  I decided C or D would give white too nice a shape on the left.  I though B was too loose, although it would leave more reduction possibilities later.  I decided to play it safe with C6.  Is the corner much bigger?]

(;B[eq]C[[JD\] Here, I thought I might as well secure some solid cash.  I considered attacking H16, but didn't see anything urgent.]
(;W[jq];B[jc]C[[JD\] I also considered approaching at R6 here.  Not sure which is better.]
;W[ie]
(;B[je]C[[JD\] I think something like N17 is more normal here, but I thought I'd try to build a framework on the upper right.  I suppose my corner being open and not having a stone around Q10 makes this plan a little weaker.]

;W[jb];B[kc];W[ge];B[kf];W[qc];B[qd]C[[JD\] I figured that, because of K18, I couldn't secure much territory on the top anyway, so I blocked this way.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[rd];B[re];W[qe];B[od]C[[JD\] Oddly, I just learned this joseki last week.  Locally, black's corner is pretty big.]

(;B[jg];W[pg];B[if]C[[JD\] My idea was to be thick so I could reduce the right side, which is getting huge.

Hoang: Right side very solid, almost complete.];W[nj]C[And now invasion is no longer possible. Neither is a reduction, only thing you can do now is to try to prevent from growing bigger.]
;B[lj];W[mk];B[kl];W[lm];B[km];W[lo]C[[JD\] Obviously, white is blocking off a bunch of territory, but not sure what else I could do.  At least this prevented it from getting even bigger.]

(;B[so]C[[JD\] It is a bit early for endgame, and B17 and even N15 are probably bigger.  I was trying to exploit some aji on the lower middle group.  I ended up getting a reduction, but it wasn't worth it.]
