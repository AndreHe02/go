GC[This game ended rather closely, after a "homerun" of a black group in the lower right corner.
The game had no time limit, we finished it in approx. 40 minutes.
Both Ghostyyyy and I have no rating; my guess would be that I am somewhere between 20th and 23rd kyu.
I'm curious what a stronger player would comment on this game - especially on the black invasion on the left side and the outcome of the white attack on the lower right corner.
I've added some notes and some questions at several moves - it would be great if you could comment on them.]


;B[jc];W[dk];B[jj];W[de]LB[dc:B][ke:A]C[I think this is a rather bold move, especially on 13x13. Does this "being bold" make it a bad move?

Yeah, definitely.  The reason is b/c on the 13, the corners are more valuble, and the 5-4 focuses on the side and the center.

Note: A and B are for the next move.]
(;B[gc]LB[dc:B][ke:A]C[My feeling was that it would be good to expand toward the (mostly) unsecured corner.

Yup, your feeling was correct, but i think this was too slow.  I would either enclose the corner at A, or approach at B. Otherwise, w can enclose the corner at B. Please go back one move to see the variations (sorry, this is my first GTL review, so i'm still learning ^^)]
;W[hj]C[In general, the one-point approach should only be used when you've got a moyo (territorial framework) behind it. The opponent can pincer, and leave w unable to settle.

But with the knight's approach, you can settle and secure something, along with being able to reduce the opponent's potential territory, too (sliding under the 4-4, invading at the 3-3 in response to a pincer, etc.)]

(;B[ec]C[I'm not sure why I thought that to be a good move :-)  I suppose I expected white to answer in the upper left corner...

heh heh.^^  You were correct, but you don't have to be so meek here, if you want to worry about the upper left, then you should just play D-11, which is the standard approach to the 5-4.

Please see the variation.];W[jh]LB[ii:C][kj:B][jk:A]C[I think this move is a good trade-off for white (in exchange for some terretory in the upper left corner).

This is very interesting, and less common than a double knight's approach (i.e. H-3 and L-6). Usually you respond at one of the marked letters. A and B are the simplest way to play.]

(;B[ik]C[Is this an appropriate defense move in such a situation?

I would say no, b/c now w can block with H-3 and make good shape (D-3 would be the correct distance from the 2 stone wall), and i would think that b will want to make another move in the lower right to make sure his group lives.]
;W[hf]C[I think K8 would have been far more effective.

Yeah, you've got the right idea, but I would go lower, and play L-8 or L-9.

Keep the bottom in mind, too, either H-3 or G-2 would be nice to get in at some point.]
;B[ch]C[An effort to invade the left side. Thinking about it now, another move in the upper left corner (e.g. C10) would have been better - especially considering E11.

Yup, I agree. As for C-6, I think he should just play C-5, and make a normal approach, b/c w can now play C-4, which is a standard response to the large knight's approach here.]
;W[dh]C[I would play C-4 here, as attaching helps strengthen b, and w's gaps are very wide.]
;B[cg]C[This is too meek. B can hane at D-7 or D-5.];W[cf]C[this allows b to push through, so i would play something like D-7 instead.]
;B[bf];W[dg];B[ce];W[df];B[cd];W[ci];B[bg]C[b doesn't have to connect immediately, you'll be safe.]
;W[kj];B[kk];W[ki];B[ke]C[Certainly not good. This should be some defence move in the corner being under attack (e.g. M3).

Yeah, definitely.];W[lk]C[This was the point when I knew that I overdid it in the lower right corner :-)

Heh heh, yeah^^];B[kl];W[jl]C[W should play H-3 here, even if b lives, the placement doesn't work here, but w can build up a wall to protect the left side.]
;B[ij]C[Ouch^^ should play J-2 here.];W[ll];B[il];W[km];B[jk]
;W[hl]C[At that point, I was pretty sure that there would be no way to escape. Which move(s) of white did allow me to run to the upper part of the board?

Ouchies, this isn't good. First thing you should do is play H-3, and keep K-1 in mind, b/c you'll want to get it in pretty soon.]
;B[jm]C[Now w has to punish b's mistake, and *must* play H-3, which'll definitely kill.]
;W[lm]C[Ah-ha, here's the move, M-1 would only create a false eye, so he shouldn't have connected, and played H-3 instead (its a *major* move). Playing H-3 will destroy any remaing chance to live.]
;B[hk]C[Yup, and now w's chance is gone.];W[gl];B[gk];W[fl]
;B[ii];W[hi]C[I probably would've done G-5.];B[hh];W[gi];B[gh]
;W[fi]C[Either my position was better than I thought, or white was taking it easy on me... are there any possibilities for white to kill black?

I'd say the latter. As long as w keeps that J-7 hole closed off, b should die.]
;B[ih];W[jg]C[During the game, I thought white J7 would have settled it.

Yeah, my guess is that w didn't want to take any chances w/ the cutting points.]
;B[gf];W[gg]C[Ouch, w's too agressive here, just needs to hane at G-9, and that should keep b from escaping. I wouldn't be surprised if b lives now.]
;B[hg];W[fg];B[if];W[he];B[ig];W[ge]C[At first, I thought white K9 would stop black, but trying it afterwards seemed to show that black would escape... is that true?

Yup. b/c when b pushes through the second time, he'll atari the K-9 stone.]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[jd];W[hc];B[hb];W[fc];B[fb];W[fd];B[ic];W[dc]
;B[cc];W[eb];B[db]C[Any better alternatives for black?

Hmmm...... not really.];W[ed];B[dd];W[ec];B[da];W[le];B[ld]
C[Would a cut on M8 have worked? I think so...

yup, sure would.];W[lf];B[me];W[kg];B[bi];W[bj]C[Not a good idea. This allowed black to cut.

Yup, absolutely correct.];B[ai]C[I would cut immediately.];W[aj]
;B[cj];W[dj];B[di];W[ck];B[ci];W[bk];B[hd]C[I would take E-5 instead.]
;W[ie];B[je];W[fe];B[ea]C[B doesn't have to worry about that, as there's bigger moves elsewhere.]
;W[fk];B[gj];W[fj];B[fh];W[ei];B[hm]C[Have to get E-7 instead, big move.]

Hope this review helps, and have lots of fun! ^^])
(;B[ii];W[kk];B[kj]C[I would block in this direction, so that b's stones face each other.]
;W[jk];B[ih];W[ij];B[jg])
(;B[jk];W[hh]C[This is the standard move, but is bad on this size board b/c his stones are off in the center, so he'll have to come up with something else, but I'll leave that for some other time.]

(;B[dc]C[Now its just like b started with a 3-4, w made a one-point approach, and you tenukied (or responded at G11, you get the idea)]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[bb]C[I think that this is better for b instead of E-12, b/c he has too many stones to the right, and will become overconcentrated.]
;W[ch]C[W doesn't have to worry about being open on the side, b/c there's bigger moves on the board (the monkey jump should be saved for yose (endgame)), plus, it usually ends in gote.]
))
(;B[ke]C[You could always enclose a corner, and enclosing in this direction's always possible, Its just that i'd prefer to have K-11 at L-10 and play L-9 at J-11, so the shimari (enclosure) faces his stones.]
;AB[ic][kd]AE[jc][ke]C[Like this.]))
