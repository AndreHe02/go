(;B[do]LB[co:A]C[Tried to go for preventing the shimari here, but I forgot that it should have been at A instead.

Danip: the two movements are possible. Is just a matter of taste]
;W[co]
(;B[dn]C[Danip: This movement, according to my joseki dictionary is used by professionals. Normally another sequence is done]
;W[cp]LB[fp:A]C[If I wanted to make better use of my stone on the stone at Q4, where could I have played?

- A (followed by W-F3 and B-G3)?

Danip: I don't think that would be joseki];B[cn]C[I'm not sure if this was a bad decision. But I know I have a bad habit of playing aggressively locally, when it might be better for me to play elsewhere. I think that while I capped the opponent's stones off, I didn't do much to help the other stones I'd already laid down. And as you see later, I don't take full advantage of this by extending until much later at move 153 (where I think I'm a little too cautious and might have been able to do better).

Danip: This is actually joseki. You are in a high position so you are actually helping your other stones. Let's see what comes later]
;W[nq]LB[qn:A][iq:B][lq:C]C[I originally respond to white by playing at A. Now that I look at it, it wasn't a bad move, in relation to my plays on the left, and provides me a lot of influence towards the top. However, I wasn't aware of that.

Would B have been a bad move to play at this point? Because I don't like allowing my opponent to settle territory.

Danip: Go is always about giving and winning. You have to allow him to win a few points so you can win the game. You cald have tried Q6 also, to use your stones in the left side.

You could also try E3]
(;B[qn];W[jp]
(;B[gq]C[Danip: I wouldnt do this so early, maybe later. Once you decided to put your stone in R6 you should be a little bit consequent]

(;B[hq];W[hr];B[ip];W[iq]LB[jo:B][hp:A]C[I spent a lot of time deciding whether A or B would be a better move. I wanted to survive, but I misread this thinking I would lose the exchange if I moved at A.

It's fortunate, because after seeing the potential route that A would have taken me down, I would've been boxed in with no influence towards the center (See move 54 on branch.) I didn't read into the global cost of losing if I played A (except that it would be an extremely heavy shape).

After deeming A a no go, I wondered how best I could leverage this position, and the conclusion I came to is, I could try to shut in white with B (Please see comment at move 35).]

(;B[jo];W[hp];B[io]C[I don't think this is the best shape, although it achieves a small wall.

Danip: You didnt end up in a good position here. Two groups separated and none of them alive]
;W[kp];B[ko];W[lp]LB[no:A][dr:B]C[I moved at A, but could I have afforded to kill the corner first at B and then later block the center off better? Was I in gote here? Or could I have afforded to treat it as sente and strike somewhere else?

Danip: Sente or gote are about movements itself and not about moments :). If you don't do something with the stones in k5 probably they will struggle]
;B[no];W[dr]LB[cf:E][ch:F][ni:C][pi:B][qi:D][ds:A]TR[cj]C[I think that I should have played elsewhere instead of at A as I did. But I wanted to kill the corner even though I didn't realize yet that I couldn't. Could I have afforded to play at B or C? Or would it have been better to play it safe at D with my shape? Or should I have taken advantage of the wall I had in the bottom left and played at E or F?

Danip: B, D and E look like good options for me. F is in the middle of E and triangle and C is too high.]
;B[ds];W[cs];B[es];W[br];B[bo]C[Danip: This would end in gote so better to play in another place]

;W[qf];B[qi];W[nc]LB[qc:A]C[I respond to white at A.

Could I have responded elsewhere?

Danip: Sure! There are a few possibilities. I show you a few, if you want to know more you can check in a joseki dictionary.]

(;B[qc];W[oe];B[pe];W[pf];B[od]C[I played here, because I wanted to strengthen my three black stones in the top right, before I proceeded to try and cut and kill the white stones on the right.]

;W[pg];B[ph];W[sh];B[si];W[qg]LB[sd:A][se:B]C[I think this is where I made a mistake and I could have killed this territory much more decisively.

I play at A, but unless I misread the possible branch, I should have played at B instead to avoid a Ko battle.]

Danip: having only those three the correct one is the rectangle. so now you could even go longer (theoretically) I would have played A.]
