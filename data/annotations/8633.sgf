Hello,
I am vorpal 1d on KGS. 
Let me know if you have any questions regarding my comments.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[pp];W[pq]C[whats the proper way to answer the q4 attachment?]

[op][nq][nr][ns]LB[nc:B][cf:A][dj:C]C[The area around the marked points is played out.
This means that both groups are very strong and there is not much advantage to be gained or lost.

In this case it is better to play in empty parts of the board.

The points that occur to me for black are, in order, A B and C.]
;W[op]LB[jd:B][cn:A]C[p4 being too slow?

Good. This is correct.

Now B has a chance to play at A or B. Both should be good plays.]
;B[kq]C[This move is way too close to your strong group on the bottom.]
;W[iq]C[Good play. The correct direction.];B[ko];W[io];B[hp]
;W[ip];B[go]LB[im:B][dn:A]C[Your play at G3 was OK but personally I like the idea of playing at either A or B.

Black will have two weak groups and you should get a good game however it plays out.]
;W[gq];B[hq];W[hr];B[gp];W[fq];B[jr];W[ir];B[dn]C[This is a big point for B to get.]
(;W[bp]C[Way too small.

Your group is in no danger of dying so you can think of attacking.

The question is... now or later.];B[dk];W[cf];B[ch];W[fc];B[df]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[de];W[bf];B[dg]
(;W[ic];B[lc]LB[kc:B][ie:A]C[I think black should have attacked at L17. There is no reason for him to hang back like this.

This position presents a very interesting question: Is the white 17-line group strong enough to walk away from?

If I were white I would probably play at A or B to stabilize the group. The reason is that I want to invade the top-right or right sides but cannot do it if the 17-line white group is weak.]
(;W[qf];B[qh];W[nc];B[le];W[qc]C[3-3 invasion allowing black a huge moyo

It might be better to go directly into the 3.3 point instead of playing O17 first.

In any event you can see the pressure beginning to build on white's top-left group.]

(;W[od]C[p16 being pretty small i guess];B[pe];W[hf]C[trying to do sth about black's center

Good timing here. If you wait any longer it will be too late for this group.]
;B[id];W[hd];B[ie]
(;W[he]C[j14 instead?

I think this move is good.];B[jc];W[ib];B[no]
(;W[if]C[i was pretty happy to get this turn in :)

The only problem is that you are way behind in territory.
I think your group here might be strong enough to live so it is maybe time to try and break up black's right side.]
;B[kj];W[kg];B[lh];W[lg];B[mg]C[I think you have some potential to break in a bit here.]
(;W[kh]C[This move just forces black to protect his defects.]
;B[li];W[jj];B[ki]C[This looks like an empty threat to me. I think it is a big mistake and you can try to break in a little more now.]
(;W[ji];B[jk]
(;W[hj]C[This is good locally but I think you have bigger threats

Final comment.];B[ik];W[hk];B[ij];W[ii];B[ep];W[eq];B[do];W[cp]
;B[bn];W[fp]C[This point is best left unplayed as it has no follow up at this moment and black is not likely to play here either.]

There are a lot of defects in black's position in this area and the way the game plays out he makes a lot of territory here.
I think you could reduce him quite a bit.

Also, don't forget about possible incursions around the points of A and B.]

I would offer this an another approach.

The idea here is that you are way ahead in territory and want to limit black's ability to equalize on the right side.]
(;B[lc];W[je]C[This way pushes black one line to the right. You can play at G16 to make your group alive or let the F17 stone go and run easily as your K-line stones are not too close to black's D-line wall.

Again the idea here is that the area around the D-line wall is very strong and you don't want to play too close to it.]
)
(;B[hc];W[mc]C[This would be ideal from white's point of view. Black has attacked the F17 stone for which he will get precious little territory. You, on the other hand, have established a strong group on the top side and severly limited black's potential on the top and right.]
