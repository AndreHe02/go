C[TMTM [5k\]: hi

J: Hi, my name is Jay and I will be reviewing your game. My comments will start with "J:"]
;B[qd]C[Hi Dear Reviewer,

I wish you all the best in 2016!

Aside from that I have a (hopefully) interesting game to look over :) My main questions are

1. The corner playout (it was not joseki :D) in the lower right -- how could I have played it better?

2. verious mid-game position where I had to find a good invasion/reduction -- i believe I failed there. What would be better moves? At the relevant points you will find markings on the board. But of course they might be wrong as well :D So I am very open to your suggestions.

3. The final fight.... it was very intense... where did I give it away?

Of course, the critical problems might be totally different from what I think they are. So I am grateful for any advice that you wish to give me.

Thanks in advance!];W[dp];B[dc];W[qp];B[ce];W[od];B[oc];W[nc]
;B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jc]C[J: So far so good.];B[hc]TR[lc]C[J: H17 is a nice forcing move looking to poke at M17.]
;W[je]C[J: White can choose to tenuki. K15 is ok.]
(;B[op];W[mp];B[on];W[po];B[oo];W[qm]C[J: Q5 is a minor mistake. White can play R7 directly, meaning white made black stronger for no reason.]

(;B[qq]C[J: R3 can be at K4. See variation.];W[qj]LB[ol:E][lo:B]
[kp:A][mq:D][rq:C]C[I am not pleased with this corner...

Where to play now?]
(;B[rq]C[this move was probably slow....

J: K4 is good still, though R3 already let white jump to R10. The corner is big also, so S3 is playble, it's just more territory oriented instead of trying to fight.]
;W[jp]C[J: K4 is nice to take.];B[cn];W[co]C[J: The C5 kick helps black become stronger.]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[cj]C[J: D15 also possible for a higher position.]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[bo]LB[he:A];B[he]C[is this even good?

J: H15 is ok. If white plays it, black may need to answer.]
;W[ig]
(;B[gg]C[J: G13 feels a bit submissive. The corner looks big, but white can still attempt a reduction at D18. Another option is playing R12 now. See variation.]
;W[hi];B[fi]C[J: R12 still possible. O13 is another idea.];W[og]

(;B[qh]C[I believe this is necessary because it prevents WS15

J: White can't attempt S15 until he has R12.]
(;W[oi]LB[kj:C][mj:B][gk:F][ho:E][lo:A][hq:D]C[also a critical moment. I have sente and no weak groups. What to do?

so many ideas.... probably the best move is not in A-F but something else entirely]

(;B[mj]TR[on]C[J: N10 is a one dimensional to reduce the top. There's no need to be jealous of that because black also got the left side. The relationship between the marked stones is poor.

J: Black can turn his attention to the bottom side. One idea is G4,  see variations.]
;W[ml]C[J: Good aggressive move by white. N10 has become a huge liability, and it's hard to find a good move to pull it out. Can try something like P10, see variation.]

(;B[nk];W[nl];B[ol];W[ok];B[oj];W[pk];B[pj];W[pi];B[nj];W[pl]
;B[qi]
(;W[om]C[J: Bad white mistake, should be at S10, see variation.]
;B[qk];W[oq]
(;B[nq]C[the next move shows that this move is wrong :(

J: O3 is ok.];W[nr]C[this move was unexpected]
(;B[pq]C[J: Black should play N3 first. Later, black may decide to play Q4 instead, as R5 and Q3 are then miai to connect. See variations.]
;W[or];B[pp];W[np]
(;B[pr]C[J: Q2 is dangerous black can try running out first with N6, because white's N8 isn't safe yet. Q6 is a way to make life.]

(;W[qo]C[J: White can put more pressure on the black group with S4 instead. See variation.]
;B[rs]
(;W[mn]LB[gk:D][fn:E][ho:A][hp:C][hq:B]C[What to play now? Or am I already far behind?

I feel like this is a critical point... though I might of course be wrong :D

J: Locally, the result is horrible for black, but catching R10 offsets this, so the game is still playable for both sides. F6/G6 is a calm way to continue. H3 is a gamble.]

(;B[hq]C[this was probably the game-loosing move :(

or not?];W[gq]C[J: F3 is enough for white, G3 may give black sente moves at G2 and G4.]

(;B[jq]C[J: Black can also try starting at G2. See variations.]
;W[ip]
(;B[iq]C[maybe this move lost it :D]
(;W[kq]C[J: H4 is better. See variation.];B[hp];W[kr];B[gp]
;W[fq]C[J: white let black out.];B[gn]C[J: H7 also possible.]
;W[fn];B[fm];W[en];B[gl];W[fj]C[this was so unexpected!!!

J: good idea from white.]
(;B[gj]C[J: black can simply answer at E11, see variations.]
;W[gi]
(;B[gh]C[J: G12 is a bad shape. E11 is still ok.];W[ei];B[fh]
;W[gk]
(;B[hj]C[J: No reason to save H10, black should keep the tarritory safe with E10. See variation.]
;W[hk];B[ij];W[ek]
(;B[dj]C[this was bad for sure :(

in fact, this seems to be a crucial mistake ...

J: Yes, E7 is better, but the damage is already done. This is my last comment.]
