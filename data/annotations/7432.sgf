C[Olaf199 [2k\]: hi

- Hi, I'm dN21death on KGS and I'm probably around 3 dan. Reading and fuseki is probably the most important thing you should be doing now. Though reading is always important so you should do some tsumego. You had too many weak groups because of being greedy or not connecting earlier which should of been fixed. Even though, you still could of won if not for absense of reading xD. If you have any more questions or whatsoever you can contact me on the email or on KGS.

(;B[jp]C[I know this move is unorthodox, but did know how exactly to deal with it. Which is why I decided to jump out.

-Jumping out was simple and easy, this is an odd move though if black played at L4, ive seen that which is actually not recommended.]
;W[ho];B[dr]C[Maybe here i should have played elsewhere instead of 3-3

- I thought of G6 though i dont think 3-3 is that bad... I would like to take the intiative rather than let black attack me though.]

(;W[cq];B[fm]C[Again here, i wasnt too sure whether to extend along the top, or to leave my group for him to attack. I thought it was better to settle first, so thats what i chose.]
;W[hm]C[-This is fine.];B[cr]
(;W[ck]C[-This ignores your weak group I think and doesnt make left solid territory anyways.]
;B[km]C[Not too sure how to deal with this move either.

-This move doesnt do much for Black, the bottom is still open because of H3 is lower than K4. Though letting him make a shimari isnt great, you still have a weak group. Again I would rather have intiative when attacking or being attacked. B isnt alive yet on bottom if you play B2.]
;W[qn]C[Perhaps not the best approach

-I dont know the 2 space low approach that well but it looks fine here. I thought maybe he would play R4 which would let you extend along the side.
I usually play Q5 as black here which can turn out well depending on how its played for either side.]

(;B[pl]C[-I dont like this move by B.];W[qq]C[-Right choice.]
;B[qp];W[pp]
(;B[rp]C[Maybe there was a better sequence for white than the one i played.]

(;W[qf]C[-You are not safe at all you at bottom. I might of connected the two groups.]

;W[mc];B[le];W[po]C[Maybe not hte best move. The left side would be very big though.

-What is this move? It only helps black.. hes supposed to R5.]

(;B[on];W[rf]C[-Greedy, you have weak groups,left and top to develop. B has many places where you can reduce.]

(;W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gd];B[hd];W[hc];B[gb]C[Maybe playing the atari at H15 is better?]
;W[ic];B[rm];W[bd];B[bb];W[br]C[I regretted playng this move.

-If you had a plan, you shouldnt of because b is attackable on both sides if he chooses to play C11 or so.]

C[-Don't push him into your moyo unless you think of killing him. You dont need to save yourself because you still have K2.]

-Which group? D2? You could of been doing that if you played K9 instead of H11 probably. Also its good to keep in mind B played in here and had sente before he invaded. So to kill him in gote just helps you solidify your territory.]
