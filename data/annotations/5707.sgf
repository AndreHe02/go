C[Hi,

The players are me (black) and Prodigious(white). Though we're both finnish 3 kyus, white is clearly stronger and I thought the game a bit as a teaching game.

I usually lose my games by making weak groups that end up killed or attacked severely. This time I managed to avoid that but I fell behind in points anyway. I hope you can show the critical points of the game!

Thanks very much for the review in advance!

reid: OK, we'll see if we can address the "weak groups" problem - go is all about fighting, and weak groups can't fight effectively.  So you need to know how to avoid having weak groups in order to improve.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[po];B[qm]C[j: I like this because it's a bit of an extension from the solid position. However, was it correct?

reid: R7 is very nice in this shape.  In fact, white often plays Q6 or R6 instead of Q5/R5 because the pincer works so well when black already has the upper right corner enclosure.  But we can't really say that Q5 is a mistake, either.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qr]LB[qp:A]C[reid: hmm, it's common to see one of the josekis that follows from black A at this point.  Black A would work nicely with the top-right corner enclosure in this game.  See variation.

But black R2 is joseki too.];W[qp]
(;B[mq]LB[rq:D][or:A][rr:B][rs:C]C[reid: Here is your first lesson in making strong shapes for fighting.  Please study the comments and variations in the next three or four moves closely - they hold some of the keys to why you have trouble with weak groups.

The usual move here is A.  It may seem slow, but then black is making territory here while white is counting on his influence being useful later.  With A, black keeps his shape strong so he can continue to attack the white stones.

N3 is also joseki, but black needs to know the continuation (black makes a mistake later that lets white get an advantage).

After black A, white B is gote because of black C, so white has trouble getting an eye in the corner.  In contrast, black can play D  (if he gets surrounded on the outside) and he is nearly alive already.

See variation for the continuation, and for why white may not want to play R3 right away..]
;W[om]LB[on:A]C[reid: This feels like an overplay for white, but e he can get away with it because black played N3 instead of P2 (this is the cost of playing faster but weaker moves - your opponent also gets to move faster).

If black had played P2 instead of N3, P7 is an overplay for sure.  See variation.]

(;B[pm];W[ol]LB[on:A];B[pk];W[or];B[pr];W[oq]
(;B[op]C[reid: black makes the first mistake in this joseki.  See variation for the correct sequence.]
;W[pp];B[os];W[np];B[nr];W[oo]LB[on:A]C[reid white protects the weakness at A while pressing black down and attacking him.  This is a great result for white.]
;B[jq]LB[qf:E][pi:C][ok:D][nq:A][lr:B]C[j: So far, I have no complaints. My position in the upper right is not too bad and white has zero territory.

reid: Hmm, I come to a different conclusion:  the white group at P5 is almost alive, and the black stones on the bottom don't have great shape. That means the black stones at Q9 are not as strong as they need to be.  White could start an attack with A (to make sure these stones are alive) then pincer with C.  Black D is natural, then white E makes a nice extension for white inside black's territory.

If we analyze the position after white E, I'd say black's bottom territory is no bigger than white's two groups on the right side.  The P17, R16 shimari is about the same as white's two corners, but black has a burden with his Q9 stones.  That makes this a good position for white.

Perhaps black should play A instead.  White won't connect, of course, but that means that white doesn't have two eyes yet while black is almost alive already (capturing P3 would make Q1 and O1 eyes), and it also makes white S2 much less effective.  Since white is not quite stable yet, the C, D, E sequence might be a bit risky..]
;W[jd]
(;B[ok]LB[lp:B][rp:G][kq:A][rq:F][rr:C][sr:E][rs:D]C[j: I thought this point as the critical point between opposing spheres of influence, but is it too slow?

reid: yes, white should play as described in move 25 instead.

On the other hand, black could have played P9 instead of K3  If white tries to attack the lower black stones with A (L3), black runs out while attacking with B (M4).  BTW, white has a gote eye in the corner if he starts the sequence at C through G.  In the real game, black responded to white C with O1 which gives white more eyeshape and territory by playing D.]
;W[qe];B[pd]LB[rd:B][re:C][qg:A]C[reid: in response to R15, black must choose between keeping as much corner territory as possible and attacking the white invader.  Q16 chooses to defend the corner, but I think black should be trying to use the Q9 stones which means attacking R15.  Black A or B, or C  look better.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[qi]C[j: I don't know how to handle this invasion.]
;B[qg]LB[qh:A]C[reid: this invasion is fine.  black is much stronger in this area than white, so black must attack.

perhaps white should have played one line closer, at A (R12) to prevent the obvious attack.]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[qf]
(;B[pg]C[reid: Second lesson in fighting and strong shapes: black lets white off the hook here.  The atari at A is natural - see variation.

In close fighting like this, you don't have time to be cautious.  Things change so fast, and you must strike while the iron is hot - don't let your opponent have any breathing space that you don't need to give him.]
;W[re]C[reid: white gets an eye here.];B[rh];W[sf];B[ri]C[reid: here is the third lesson in not making weak groups.  A basic tactical fact in go is that the more (non-alive) groups you have, the more trouble you're in.  That's because each group needs two eyes, and it takes moves to make eyes.  Moves are the 'currency' in this game - you don't want to spend your currency unless you get something in return for it.

Here black has chosen to extend to S11 instead of the normal connection at R12  This leaves a cutting point for black, which in combination with the unsettled stones at Q9, makes black have too many weaknesses to be able to attack white strongly.

If black connects at R12 instead, black has only two groups to take care of in this area, instead of (potentially) three produced by S11.  Black may think that white can't reasonably expect to cut at R12 and that's true, but that potential cut is aji that white can exploit later.  Black R12 makes for less aji, and therefore a stronger position for black.

By the way. after black R12, white S11 seems like sente, but white can't afford to have black play T12 because it threatens the S14 eye.  Ans similarly, white can't afford to make any moves around A because as black defends, the R4 group gets weaker.  So black R12 does a much better job of immobilizing white's R11 stone.

Also by the way, as soon as I see my opponent play something like S11 instead of R12, I start thinking about how to exploit the weakness.]
;W[oe];B[ng]C[reid: Of course white will peep at P14, and black really has to answer it.  So Black should think about what other moves would be better.  Perhaps black could try P14 instead of O13.  See variation on move 46.]
;W[of];B[og];W[mc]C[j: This move is difficult to answer, I'm clueless.

reid: Yes.  See variation.]
(;B[nd]C[reid: White doesn't have much choice about answering here since the white S15 stones are not yet alive.]
;W[rb];B[qc]
(;W[sd]C[reid: Eh?  Why didn't white connect to his S18 corner stone?  See variation.]
;B[md]LB[kc:B][sc:A]C[reid: simply taking the corner with A is bigger and better.  N16 helps white remove his problem at B.]
;W[lc]C[reid: white should say "thank you" now.];B[mf]LB[hc:A]
C[j: I was happy to connect, but it feels I'm falling behind with these slow moves.

reid: Yes, this move is slow.  It is slow because black surrounds a living group.

N2 and T17 seem to be miai.  Rather than fall behind, black needs to do something else, even if there's some risk.  Perhaps attacking with A right away is one way to settle  the N16 group.]
;W[hq]LB[hc:A][de:B]C[reid: given the potential invasion at A, white B might be a better idea.]
;B[lo];W[nq];B[lr];W[ml];B[kl]LB[nk:a]C[j: Was A better for black?

reid: Well, both M5 and L8 are somewhat meaningless.  First, there is no resonable hope to attack this white group (white can live even if he lets black get an extra move).  Second. these black moves have no secondary purpose other than to try to surround white.  They cannot build future territory towards the left because white already has H3, D4, and D17 in place.

White N8 was actually a move that black might have wanted to get.  It expands black's territory while limiting the future of any left-side moyo that white might try to build.  So black M5 which induced N8 is what makes black's next move difficult.

Strangely enough, the main reason we amatuers lose games of go is because we make moves that actually help our opponent.  If you want to get stronger, you must examine each move you consider to see if his response can make the exchange (the pair of moves) better for him than for you.

Black should probably just leave this area and try to pick a fight somewhere else with move 55 (M5).]
;W[nk];B[nj];W[mj];B[ni]C[reid: black certainly feels cramped here.]
;W[ci]C[reid:  and white gets the big move first.

It looks like black is a bit ahead on real territory, although the margin is thin.  His problem is that he has no future prospects.  All the good territory / moyo moves belong to white now.  Anywhere black plays now, he will be fighting at a disadvantage.  While black scrabbles and scratches for two eyes, white will be picking up 5, 10, and 15 point chunks of territory.]
;B[de]LB[hc:A]C[reid: I don't think black has any chance of winning this game with conventional moves anymore.  It looks like it's time to bring in the heavy guns, by which I mean the desperation measures.

Black needs to kill something.  It looks like the best hope is the K16 group - that's big enough that it could help make up black's defict, and it's unsettled enough that there is some hope of a real attack.  Black should try A to take white's base.

Mind you, I don't think black can win the game as long as white answers reasonably, but on the other hand, black can't hope to win by reducing or other normal methods.  Black has to try to stirr up some confusion and hope for some mistakes from white.

The advantage of an attack from A is that it tries to use the previous slow moves around N14.  Black may be able to redeem these moves if he can get a good fight going.

Perhaps white should have played 64 (C11) at D15 to forstall this attack.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[fe];W[gd];B[ei]LB[gd:b][fe:a]
C[j: I wanted to make this shape, but was A B exchange too bad for black?

reid: Hmmm, it's usually a red-flag to me when I hear someone say "I wanted to...".  In go, your play should almost always be guided by the positions already on the board.  The only time you get the luxury of playing a move "because you want to" is usually during the first few moves of the opening, and not always then, even.  Your job as a go player is to determine what the best move for the current position is.  Replace your desires with an understanding of the requirements of the position: you must become one with the board, grasshopper.

When black plays D15, he is already at a two-to-one disadvantage - of course he is going to come out worse in any fighting that occurs in this area.  Unfortunately, the exchange of F15 for G16 is enough to give white the entire top side and swing the balance of territory solidly in white's favor (the topside area is nearly as much as black's entire territory).]
;W[dk]C[reid: black is weak in this area, so white could probably attack more strongly here, but then he doesn't really need to either - he's enough ahead that he can relax a bit.]
;B[ch]C[j: I wanted to settle down as quickly as possible.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[bj];B[di];W[cj];B[bg];W[ai];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[ep]C[Seeguu [6k\]: en silti pidä >.<];B[fr]
;W[gr]C[reid: no need for white to take this risk - simply connect with G3 is good enough.]
;B[fp];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn];B[es];W[fo]C[j: I'm behind. Why did I lose?

Thanks to the reviewer very much.

reid: Well, I would say the main problems are first: not following joseki in the lower right corner - black P4 allowed white to settle his problems too easily, and black ended up with no territory. 

The second problem was the fighting in the upper right: even though black had the shimari there, he ended up on the defensive and even played a gote move (N14) to defend it.

M5 and L8 were significant mistakes in direction.  Black tried to attack a white group that was already 95% settled.  M5 and L8 had no future prospects because white already had D17, K16, D4, and H3 in place.  

Playing S11 instead of R12 is a problem, but it didn't actually have any consequnce in this game because of the N10/O11 exchange.  By the way, after white has N10, it is even more difficult for black to catch up by attacking the K16 group with H17.


To get stronger, try slowing down a bit.  For a while, you just need to take it on faith that playing stronger (fixing your weak points and not playing too fast) will pay off in the long run.  Go is a long drawn-out game, and you need to build solidly and carefully so that your structures can last to the end of the game.

Be very careful that you are not helping your opponent.  There is a strong tendency to think "it's sente, it must be good", but it is often better to leave it for later (it may be a ko threat, for example).  Instead, go directly to the move that needs to be played.

When you do attack, it's safer to make the assumption that your opponent is going to survive the attack.  Your goal then is not to kill, but to make a bit of profit while your opponent is busy surviving.  That means your attacking stones should have a secondary purpose: either another attack or a chance to grab territory or build a moyo.  To my mind, the real joy in go is working two or more of your opponent's weaknesses against each other to achieve a win.

Don't back away from a fight.  Q13 was too timid.  In go, the situation is often balanced on a knife-edge, and you don't have time for caution.  Relish the exhilaration of the chase!

As a special feature, I have added small quiz to check your grasp of some of the fighting techniques we've discussed in this review - see variation.

Good luck, play strong - reid]

But a pro will choose the top with no hesitation.  Why?  It has to do with what happens next.  In the bottom, white has natural invasion points at either A or B, and perhaps C.  But on the top, there is only one invasion point: D.  This means that white can complete his formation with just one move (E) while black needs two moves (F and B) to complete his formation.  White encloses slightly less space than Black, but he needs one less stone, which makes his formation more efficient.  And the bottom line in go is the efficiency of the black stones versus the white.

Strong players prefer to have two strong, completed positions separated by a wide space rather than thin, loosely connected stones spread across the same space.
