[5400]KM[5.5];B[pd]C[dada: I'm only a 4k, so my  comments should not be taken too seriously :-)]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[lq];W[no]L[qq]C[dada: Unusual. In most pro games I've seen, w enters at 'a'  (r3).]
;B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[qr]C[dada: Not urgent];B[lo];W[nm];B[pl];W[rq]M[lq]
[lo]C[dada: Not urgent and gote. I would attack the two weak stones  instead.]
;B[rp];W[rr];B[lm]L[fq][fp]C[dada: Not a threat as w lives in  the corner. How about a kakri at 'a' (f3) or 'b' (f4) instead?]
;W[dj];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo]C[dada: Good];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[cr]C[dada: Not  urgent. There are many other good points on the board.]
;W[kp];B[ko];W[jp];B[jo]C[dada: You're letting w off the hook to easily]
;W[ho]C[dada: now b is  separated];B[mr]C[dada: ??];W[lp];B[mp];W[mq];B
[mo];W[np];B[nn];W[on];B[mn];W[oo];B[om]C[dada: Good -  trading territory for influence.]
;W[po]C[dada:  This may be big, but it's gote and not urgent. I would play a kakari against  the upper right corner.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[pm];W[ro];B[qm];W[rn];B[rm];W[sp]
(;B[nl]C[dada: Necessary? Where should w move this stone? Upper side is  important now, or make live for your weak group in the lower left (Variation  'B' comes to mind, to seperate the marked w stone)]
;W[io]L[ip]C[dada: protecting weakness at 'a' (j4)];B[gr]C[dada: Sure, this  move makes b alive and reduces w's territory at the bottom, but I would be  tempted to play on the upper side instead. But then, sometimes it is better  to have no weak groups, for upcoming fights.]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[dada: Choice of  joseki is a crucial point. I would have played tsuke-nobi instead (variation  B), but this is not necessarily the best joice :-)]
;W[pf]C[dada: Bow. Not  the best joice I guess. b is too strong is this area.]
;B[nd];W[qi];B[qe];W[qf];B[qj];W[pi];B[oi];W[oh];B[ri]L[nh]C[dada: hmm - a gote move. Maybe you should  have made a double-hane at 'a' (o12), in order to shut white in. Let white  live small, that doesn't hurt you. The thickness in the center you would have  gained in this process would have served two purpose

s: attacking the left side and making territory in the center.];W[rh];B
[rj];W[nh];B[ni];W[qc]M[nh][oh][pf][qf][rh][qi][pi]C[dada: Dangerous. The marked w group isn't  alive yet.]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[pc];B[rc]C[dada: ??];W[md];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mc]
;B[nb]C[dada: ??];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[qb];W[mf]C[dada: What an exchange! b lives small in the corner, and  w has built influence torwards the left and destroyed b's territory. That was  clearly bad for b. Now b is far behind.]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[of];W[lh];B[mi];W[ng];B[fc];W[hc];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed]
;B[bd]C[dada: I've never seen pro's  making this move. Seems to destroy to much potential.]
;W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[fd];W[fe]L[he]C[dada: I would have played at 'a' (h15) instead]
;B[ge];W[ff];B[hd];W[id];B[ie];W[jd];B[je];W[kd];B[le];W[ld]C[dada: wrong connection?]
;B[me];W[ke];B[dl]M[mg][mf][ng][nh][oh][pi][qi][rh][rg][qf][pf]C[dada: you should have seperated w and tried to kill the  marked group.]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[br];B[bs];W[bq];B[dq];W[bl]L[em]M[cl][dl]C[dada: How about 'a' (e7) instead? The two  marked stones are too deep in w's sphere of influence.]
;B[bk];W[bm];B[cj];W[ci];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[bg];B[dk]C[dada:  ?? Not an eye.]
;W[ak];B[aj];W[al];B[ir];W[jr]M[aj][bk][cl][dl][dk][cj][bi][bh][mg][mf]
[ng][nh][oh][pi][qi][rh][rg][qf][pf]C[dada: Funny. You both totally  ignore crucial points. Both of the marked groups don't live, but noone tries  to secure or kill the stones.]
;B[hr];W[iq];B[ej];W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[fh];W[fg];B[fk]C[dada: Good for b, but  w made it too easy for b.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[fj];B[ek];W[gj]C[dada: making  another weak w-group isn't good. w should secure the endangered group on the  right side - maybe the last chance]
;B[gg];W[fm]C[dada: too late.];B[em];W[en];B[gk];W[hj];B[hk];W[ij];B[ik]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[kc]C[dada: I like this result. b has sente, so he can do  something about w's left side.]

(;B[ip];W[jq];B[iq];W[jr];B[hp]C[dada: b has  more or less connected the weak group, and built a magnificient influence  towards the center - easy game for b now]
