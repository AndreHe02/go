C[Hi
At first i am no good in english.
every word that you tell me
i will keep it in mind
{i lost 30 game T_T never win}
please tell me someting to win
please tell me every bad move

Hello,

my name is Peter Strempel. I currently play around something like 6-7 kyu.
During the review I will show a lot of variations, so setup your SGF editor
to display branches properly. CGoban2 should do it fine (I guess you use that
as this game was played on KGS).];B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[fq]
LB[fc:A][pe:D][qe:C][qi:B]C[or f4?
i think r 11 is good too
any suggestion

F3 is good. You have many good moves here. I think F3 is as good as the others.
It is very difficult to play a bad move at move number 5. :)

(A) is also good. (B) would be the chinese opening style, (C) and (D) a territory
oriented game, somewhat old style. Your F3 is not better or worse than the
others.];W[hq]LB[cq:A][fo:C][hp:B]C[hhmmmm
how to respond it?

The main variations for the close pincer at H3 are (A), (B) or (C).
Usually (A) is a very good response. Take the corner.
(B) will get you out somewhat or you will make a base.
(C) is not so good here, it will give white territory. (C) is sometimes
played, but usually not if so early in the game.

I will show some possible variations.]
(;B[fo];W[dn]
(;B[fm]LB[ip:A]C[This is a mistake. The normal play is at (A). See variation.]
;W[dl]C[White is getting a lot here. You should attack the H3 stone. However, this is difficult.
Usually you do not play like this with the H3 pincer.];B[fc]
LB[ip:A][jq:B]C[or f9

You should play on the bottom I think. Something like J4 (A) or K3 (B)
to attack the H3 stone. But white might ignore you. So your overall
play on the bottom was not so good.];W[hc]C[again???!!!!

You made a mistake before, so maybe White hopes for the mistake again.]
;B[df]C[This is a good response.];W[fd]
(;B[cf]LB[cc:B][cd:A]C[i think f17 is dead

Yes. But you can sell it for a high price!

C14 is bad, I will show you a better alternative. See variations at (A) and (B).]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[ci]C[Now you help white to make territory. Not good. Your stones have no base yet, so
white gets some points while you defend. This is not a good strategy.]
;B[di];W[cj];B[dj];W[dk];B[jc]TR[pe][qe]LB[fj:A]C[or k16

I would jump out to maybe (A) or something. Consider White plays at F9 next, then
you will have problems.

Also, if you do not want to defend at (A), you should better enclose the upper right
corner. The corner is bigger than K17. Q15 or R15 would be good moves.]

(;W[he];B[je];W[pe]C[Yes, as you did not play here before, white can attack here. So your top side won't be very big.

So you should have better played in the corner before than at K17, because you had to defend with
K15 so White has sente.];B[qe]C[or r16
i want the corner to be my base];W[qf]
(;B[re]C[R16 is better. See variation.];W[pg];B[pd]
(;W[md]C[Difficult. I think this White move is bad and too early.

So, how to answer best?]
(;B[nd]C[This is bad for one simple reason:
If you attach ("attach" means to play directly near a stone, "touching" it) your opponent, you will
help him to get stronger. If you want to attack, you do *not* attach a stone, because attaching
stones makes them strong. But when you attack stones, you don't want to make them strong!
So it is better to attack from a little distance, like (for example) the O15 move would do.]
;W[kd];B[jd];W[nc]C[This is way the attachment of O16 helped white. White gets this nice move now.]

(;B[oc]C[Just connect at P16, or don't connect at all. You might also play atari at P15 instead trying
to keep White groups seperated.];W[ne];B[od]C[This is horrible shape.]
;W[oe];B[me];W[mf];B[le];W[ke]
(;B[kf]LB[ld:A][lf:B]C[something wrong

Yes. Let's see if I find something better. At least (A) and (B) look more promising. Please see
the variations.];W[lf];B[mc];W[ld];B[nb];W[jf]C[Urgh, this hurts.]
;B[kg];W[if];B[gh]LB[fj:A][ip:B][jq:C][qm:D]C[I would play (A), this is closer to your bottom stones.

Instead you might still attack H3 with (B) or (C) or extend on the right side with (D).]
;W[ih];B[gf]C[This move does not much, white can ignore it.]

(;W[ge];B[hf];W[ie];B[ig];W[jg];B[hg];W[kh];B[qk]LB[ip:A][jq:B]
C[is this too far

A bit, because White is so strong. R7 maybe.

(A) or (B) important moves, too.];W[pn]C[arghhhhhh
how to respond it?

Play simple. This is not a good move by White. Just respond at O4. Then White must
care for two weak stones at Q6 and H3, so White got himself into trouble here.

Please see the variation.]
(;B[nn]C[This is too lose. You leave your corner open and vulnerable to an attack.]
;W[oo];B[np]C[any suggestion?

Difficult. You will get many cutting points. For a suggestion see variation 2 moves earlier.]

I count three points on the marks.
Your lower right groups was already alive, so it made no sense to play in this area.

And while you make *three* points, you ignore the really big points at C3 and C17!]
;B[kc]C[This is good. Also worth more than all the middle-right moves.]

;B[pm]C[C3 is bigger.];W[qm];B[sm]C[for now
i think
i lost

Yes, that is right. You cannot kill this group. If we do some quick counting, black has about 12-14 points
in the lower right, maybe 25 points in the upper right. The left side wont be big, maybe 15 points.

White has a lot on the left if White can play D3. For now let's count the White left as maybe 30 points,
the top as maybe 15 points, the bottom as 10-15 points, the center as 20 points and the right as 5 points.

This makes around 45-50 points for black and maybe 80 for white *if* white can get D3. If black gets C3, white
will have around 15 points less, but is still far ahead. This is a *very* rough count, but it is clear that
white is far ahead in this game.];W[sl];B[sj]C[Small. C3 !!]

[sn]C[sorry to make you busy
please tell me
where is my weakness?

Thank you for your kindness to review my game

In the beginning you had problems to answer the pincer at H3 and H17 correct. You should make
yourself familiar with some of the common sequences. This resulted in two weak black groups on
the left board, while White could make lots of points there. These corner sequences are called Joseki.
Do not learn them by heart, but try to have a look at them and understand why they are played.

Later when you had the chance to attack white by splitting on the upper right, you failed to
do so and allowed White to connect too easily. You should try to understand that one can make
points while attacking and *not* killing the opponent. Just chase him out and meanwhile take
some territory. White did that to you on the left side.

In the endgame you played small moves first and did not play the big points. Allowing to cut
off the F6 group was a mistake. You did not play C3 for a long time, but when you did, C3 was
too dangerous and D3 had been better (because F6 group was cut off then).

I hope I could help you a little with this review.
