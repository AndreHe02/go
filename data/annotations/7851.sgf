C[Well.. I did really bad in this game, started some fights I don't know if I could win, did some invasions I also don't know.. and that's maybe the reason because I lost?
Please! help me out :)

Hello! I'm Felisratus, currently around 3k on KGS. 
You played a good and  game, which was interesting to review. After reviewing this game, I'll give you some general advices:

Before playing any exchange and especially an invasion, think: who will benefit from it more?  Even if you invade and live inside the opponents territory, it's not always good, because your opponents will get outside strength, which can be very useful. Don't be gready. You can't take all the board and leave your opponent with zero points. You don't need to invade every opponents territory, especially if you are already ahead of points. Instead of invasion think about reducing opponents area from the ounside, which is more safe.

And... impove your reading. Moves like h17 or b4 cost you alot of points. Solving life and death problems will really help you.

And the last: don't play automatically! Think at least 15 seconds before *every* move.

I hope, this review will help you. If you have any quesions, don't hesitate to ask me by e-mail.

Good luck and play strong!

(;B[jp]TR[qi]C[Ofcourse, extending from the simary is a big move. But the proverb say: Play urgent move instead of big move. Attacking/defending weak stones normally are quite urgent. When you attack a weak group, you can play some good moves keeping  sente, and than take some big point. 2 white stones on the right side are unsettled, so black r11 will be sente.]
;W[qk]C[White is happy to make his group relatively safe. Black lost his chance.
( Note, that r10 is better for W)]
(;B[cf]LB[fc:B][cf:C][fq:A]C[The very important thing in Go is to make all your stones work together. Before playing a stone, you must ask yourself,  does it cooperate well with your previous moves. Go is a war, but not just a series of independent local fights.

With k4 black says: the bottom is very important to me, I want to build a moyo there. OK, sounds good! But white h3 or g3 will be really paintul then. So black "A" not only approachs white corner, but also expands black moyo and prevents white from threatening it. f5 then will make black moyo really deep.

If black want to approach the upper-left, then with the back up in the upper right,  "B" would be the right direction (see variations).

I can't say, that "C" is a big mistake, but this stone just *only* approachs the white corner and has no good development.]
;W[ch]
(;B[ef]C[This move will lead to a complicated fight. Immediate invasion is much more simple and black result is good enough.]
;W[fd];B[di];W[dh];B[eh];W[ei]C[I never saw this so I thought it was overplay and I tried fighting, but it wasn't go so well..


No, this isn't an overplay.];B[ci];W[eg];B[fh];W[dg]C[Joseki dictionary (http://eidogo.com/) says, that f13 is a right move for black.]
(;B[ej]C[This is too early. See variation.];W[fg];B[fi];W[bd]
;B[cc]LB[ic:B][fq:A]C[Is this invasion possible? if not.. what's the best way to do something there?

The first question, you must ask yourself before  invading an opponents territory, is not "does the invasion possible?", but "does the invasion required?" Invasion is always risky and, even if you succeed and live, your opponent normally will get a compensation of an outside thikness. In the beginning of the game this exchange could be bad for you. It's good to invade, if you are sure, that you can both live inside and neutralize opponents outside thikness!

The other way is just threaten to invade and get something outside. What about j17 for black? ;)

To your question: invasion is possible, but it's to early.  To my mind, A or B are better now.
 "A" forces white to develop towards your strong group, which is certainly good for you and expands your bottom moyo. "B" threatens to invade the upper-left.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[dc];B[fc];W[ed];B[gc];W[gd]
(;B[hd]C[Here is better just H17 I think

Yes :) And after it your invasion is really successful.
If you are going to invade, you must be especially careful in reading out what will happen *before* playing a stone.]
;W[hc]C[Black can save his stones by playing on the second line (h18), but this is very painful. H16 was a really bad move :(]
(;B[ic];W[hb];B[ib];W[gb];B[id]TR[ib][ic][nc]C[Not so bad after all.]
;W[ff];B[fq]C[Finally you did it :)];W[eq];B[fp];W[cn];B[cq]
LB[rd:A]C[Is this ok?

Yes, you can invade and live, but it will make f3f4 stones weak. I would prefer to play s16 instead. This move not only enclose the corner, but also prepare attack on 3 white stones.]
;W[dq]
(;B[cr]C[b4 was the key move to live (see variations).];W[cp]

;B[br];W[cs];B[bs];W[fs]C[there I could live yet with b4, but I didn't notice during the game..

Yes, after b4 (a key point of this invasion) you will live, but you lose lot of points on the bottom.]
;B[iq];W[bp];B[qd]TR[nc][pd]C[With keima-simari r16 is a bit too solid and s16 is slightly better. This move is right witn ogeima-simari (n17 instead of o17). But anyway, this is a good move and it's really big!]
;W[ld];B[ne];W[nf];B[me];W[le];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg]C[Good result for black: now you split white on two weak groups.]
;W[lb];B[ph]C[There is a proverb "Don't peep where you can cut". In general it means: don't help your opponent to patch a cutting point, if you can cut. 
If you want to invade, you must play r12 or r11 instead.];W[qh]
;B[pi];W[qi]TR[qh]SQ[ph][pi]C[Now white is completly safe and black can't hope to attack this group. Black two stones is useless, so the marked exchange is very bad for you. This is a kind of "thank-you move", when you just help your opponent.]
;B[if];W[hg]C[Bad for white: he pushes your stones on his weak group. l12 was the right direction.]
;B[ig];W[ih];B[kg];W[lg]C[m12 cuts..


Yes and this cut should be very painfull for white. You lost a good opportunity there.]
