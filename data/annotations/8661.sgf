C[Dexxter [8k\]: hi have fun
Leson [8k\]: hi

Sebastion,
Thanks for the game to look over.
I play as vorpal 1d on KGS and will proceed my comments by "v:"

Overall a nice game.
I would call particular attention to moves 18, 42, and 64.
If you can remove moves like this from your game I think you will make a leap forward.

Feel free to email me with any questions about my comments.
Paul

KGS: vorpal];B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pe]LB[qj:A]C[I thought I have to do something against this right side, because I was afraid of a move at "A"

v: I think there are a lot of places to play depending on your personal preferences. This move is fine.]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pf];B[nc];W[qj];B[lq];W[jd]LB[dj:A]TR[nc]
C[I didn't really know where to move here, maybe "A" would have been better?

v: Yes, A is much better.
The idea is to play away from strength. A white move at A works in both directions up and down the left side.
The game move is largely wasted to the right due to the strength of the delta stone.]
;B[cj];W[cm]C[v: I would be inclined to go one move further to C8. That will put more pressure on black's group which is in your sphere of influence. However, this move is OK.]
;B[cf]C[v: The safe extension for black on the third line is two spaces to C13.

The game move is OK but black will have to come back and reinforce which will probably give you sente.]
(;W[ce];B[df];W[fd]TR[ce][df]C[v: The exchange of the delta stones helps black. His three space extension is now perfect and the corner is still open to a 3-3 point invasion. And he has sente as well.]
;B[hq];W[jq]LB[eq:A]TR[hq]SQ[qp][lq][oq]C[I thougt I have to attack now, a move at "A", to ensure territory, seemed to defensive to me.

But was it a good idea? My intention was to split the two groups and cause some trouble for black.

v: I would have played at A myself.
Looking at the bottom side before this move there are two white stones and four black stones so black is stronger in this area.
When this is the case you should be a little more defensive.

Starting a fight where your opponent is strong is an emergency measure.]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[iq];W[kq];B[lp]
(;W[jo];B[ip];W[lo]C[v: I don't think black played very well here.
You may come out OK by splitting his stones.];B[np];W[mo]C[v: I think this move is an overplay.
It is, of course, a nice place to have a white stone but it doesn't threaten to do anything else to black on the right side.
This means that he can look after his stones in the lower left.]
(;B[no]
(;W[mm];B[qm];W[io]C[v: Again I would play at E3 instead. This move pushes black in the direction he wants to go.]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[er];W[dr];B[fo]C[v: The black group on the bottome  is pretty strong now so you don't get much for attacking it.]
(;W[ep]C[v: This move is outright bad.
You cannot break the knights move so you just force black to connect.]
;B[fp];W[ho];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir];W[em]LB[be:A]C[v: I think A is still larger. This stone takes almost no territory and is too far away from the top left black group.]
(;B[pj]
(;W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[rh];W[rf];B[qk];W[rj];B[rk]C[Now I realized that my territorial situation doesn't look too good and I have to try building some territory in the middle]
;W[oj];B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[om]
(;W[nm]LB[lc:A][md:B][be:D][ej:C]C[v: Oh my....

This is an empty triangle which, if you are not familiar with it, is one of the most inefficient shapes there is.
It is also on a dame point.

This move is almost identical to a pass.

Any of the points A, B, C or D would be better (no particular recommendation here, just throwing out some possible moves).]
;B[kc];W[kd];B[jc]
(;W[md];B[lc];W[ld];B[jj]TR[jd][ho]C[I was afraid of this move but knew that it will come now, now I have to struggle in possibly make some territory

v: I think this is an overplay by black.
The usual way to determine an invasion point is to draw a line between the two delta stones and play on that line.
This black move is inside that and it can lead him to a bad end.

In any event black stakes the game on getting this stone out.]
;W[hj]CR[hh][ih][jh][hi][ii][ji]LB[dh:A]C[I thougt I could cut this stone somewhere around the marked position and hoped to get some territory or maybe some pressure on the group at "A"

In fact, forcing black to fill at K18 is aji keshi. See variation.]

There are two weak groups now on the bottom of the board and I would think that managing them will determine the outcome of the game.

A white play at E3 puts the black group under a lot of pressure while making territory.]
