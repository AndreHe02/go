C[Hi, my name is Mark, also known as XCMeijin on KGS. I haven't really been playing much online these days but maybe we'll see eachother online someday. In the meantime, it will be my pleasure to give you my thoughs on your game :D]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[qf]C[airfrog - I've never played the chinese opening (and known it was such) before, but someone played it against me in another game and I thought I'd try it out.  Is the correct way to handle it or should I have done something different?

XCMeijin - This is also known as the "Low Chinese" in particular. You can read more about it here: http://senseis.xmp.net/?LowChineseOpening

As the low chinese is more territory oriented, i dont think you did particularly badly. You may also consider playing O16 at O17. If you are feeling particularly bold, you may experiment with attaching on top with Q14, however, that would be more approapriate with the "High Chinese".]
(;B[nd];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob]
(;B[nq]C[XCMeijin - Woo... i seriously wonder why you choose to attack from inside here... definitely not making things easy for yourself. Please see variations.]
;W[qn];B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[kq]C[XCMeijin - In my view, this is very low, and you need to take some drastic measures to catch up. Please see variations.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[lc];B[kd]C[XCMeijin - I think by here you should see how much better the "High Chinese" would be for you if you wanted to create influence, where J17 would instead be at J16]
;W[rf];B[pf]C[airfrog - This move didnt seem very strong after I played it, is there a better choice or is this ok?

XCMeijin - Rather than being a strong or weak move, i think this is a "necessary" move, to make up for the less-than-efficient plays you made before. Keep these kinds of things in mind, and how your decisions in the beginning will affect your play in the future.]
;W[pg]
(;B[of]C[XCMeijin - See variation];W[se];B[qg]C[XCMeijin - Now it is too late, white has covered his weakness]
;W[ph]
(;B[og];W[pi];B[ed];W[hd]
(;B[gc]C[airfrog - I think this should have been at h17, I was worried about falling behind on territory though.

XCMeijin - H17 does seem better - see variation];W[hc];B[hb]
;W[gd];B[fc];W[id];B[jc];W[jf]
(;B[dj]C[XCMeijin - Much too passive; you must start attacking D4 heavily. See variations.]
;W[ld];B[le];W[ke];B[kf];W[je];B[kg];W[jd];B[ib];W[kc];B[nc]
;W[nb];B[jg]C[airfrog - I played here to prevent white's influence from dominating the center and the left side group.  I also considered playing an approach against the bottom left corner, would that have been better?

XCMeijin - An approach to the lower left should have been done long ago, but now you are stuck defending a heavy group. K13 is necessary.]
;W[dh]C[airfrog - I was also not sure how to handle this invasion.

XCMeijin - see variations for ideas.]
(;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ch];W[cg];B[ci];W[dg];B[en];W[iq]
(;B[jr]C[XCMeijin - I think this is too early, there are bigger moves out there.]
;W[ir]
(;B[jp]C[airfrog - here I was thinking that I wanted to create some thickness on the bottom or left side so I could consider invading the large white territory on the left.  Is this the right idea, and is there a better way of executing it?

XCMeijin - I think this is the wrong idea, as white has pretty much secured the bottom left corner. I think you should work on making sure white doesn't come out, and expanding your influence in the centre.

See variations.];W[ho];B[gn];W[go];B[fo];W[fp];B[hn];W[bq];B[io]
;W[no]
(;B[nn]C[airfrog - here, similarly, I wanted to start a fight so I could reduce the right side.

XCMeijin - If you want to start a fight, i would recommend something a bit bolder. See variations.]
;W[oo];B[mn];W[pl];B[ok]C[airfrog -at this point I was thinking to press on white's territory and seal him off, and perhaps create a large territory in the middle.  Instead, he let me in, which was what I had wanted before anyway.]
;W[ni];B[pk];W[qk];B[qj];W[ql];B[pj];W[rh];B[rj];W[li];B[mj]
C[airfrog- I was afraid here to push white into my cutting stones, but I think I may have let him get out too easily.  Should I have played differently?

XCMeijin - Again, it was "necessary" for you to play on this side instead; you have two weak groups and you ened to judge which one needs immediate attention. Thankfully, the O16 stones already have some eye space and are still open to the rest of the board.]
;W[mi];B[lj];W[ki];B[jj];W[kj];B[kk];W[ji];B[ij];W[lf];B[ih]
;W[ii];B[mf]C[XCMeijin - You were lucky; white could have easily killed you by capturing at N15]

[ls]C[XCMeijin - All in all, not a bad game. Good job on scraping the win :D

I would like to finish with two key points. First, i highly recommend you practising some life and death problems. http://goproblems.com/ has some good ones at every leve, and i recommend you test yourself often to develop your reading skills.

Secondly, From now on please keep in mine "the big picture". Take a step back, look at the whole board, and think to yourself "what is the best move for right now?"

I hope my review was helpful to you and I wish you luck in your future games.
