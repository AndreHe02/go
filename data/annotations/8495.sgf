RE[B+50.5]
RU[Japanese]

C[CZR: Hi, my name is CaeZaR on kgs.  If you have any questions, please send them to CaeZaR.kgs@usask.ca.  If you find this review helpful, please do not hesitate to ask for me by name for your next gtl review.

My review philosophy:

A good kyu review should not address every error in play; rather, it should focus on the major errors in the game, especially those errors that are repeated.  As a kyu player myself, I am incapable of finding every error anyway.

I try to restrict my comments to those that I am confident in.  Never-the-less, as my play is error prone, I may make reviewing mistakes (miss bad moves and rebuke decent/good moves) and for that I do apologize.]
;B[pq];W[pd];B[dc];W[dp];B[cf]LB[ce:A][de:B][df:C]C[Is there a better move?
Is there possible to invade in the future?

CZR: This is the Oogeima (large knight's move) Shimari and is a good move at this time as this corner is unfinished.  This shimari is not as solid as the Keima (knight's move) shimari 'A'.  Other possible shimari's are marked.]
;W[qo]SQ[pn][qn][po]C[This was the right move right?
What are other Possible moves for white?

CZR: White usually plays one of the marked points.  This is the only remaining unfinished corner on the board, so this or one of the other marked points are good moves.]
;B[rp]TR[pk][qk][pl][ql][pm][qm]SQ[np][op][mq]C[Is this a way to respond? What are other ways?

CZR: This move is unusual.
Typically you look to do one of two things:
1. Extend your Q3 stone with a marked square.
The extension move simply says: "I'll take territory on the bottom, and you take territory on the right"
2. Pincer whites R5 stone with a marked triangle.
The pincer move puts pressure on white's stone, but will end up giving you two less secure groups rather than one secure group.  As white has both adjacent corners, the pincer would have no nearby allies, so I don't think it would be a good option in this case.]
(;W[qp]LB[ro:A]C[Did I chose the right path? Or is there a better one?

CZR: Black is happy to respond to this move with R1 as it makes his position more secure, while it gains you almost nothing.  It looks like you are trying to exploit a weakness in Black's position that just isn't there and you only help him solidify his position.  You can help your own stone with 'A' instead.  See variation.]
;B[qq];W[ro];B[rq];W[op]C[Was this jump good?

CZR: Sure, now Black needs to defend and then you can take R10 and make a nice side formation.]
;B[pp]
(;W[po]TR[oo]C[should I have played p5?

CZR: I like this better as it leaves only one cutting point.  See variation.]
;B[oo]C[Was this cut correct? or should p3 do better?]
(;W[on]C[Was this the right response? I was attempting to build a big wall for the right.

CZR: You'll get a wall on the right, but Black will also get a large territory on the bottom.  I think you should fight to try and keep P4 alive.  Black starts a fight here and I think you give in too easy.]
;B[no];W[nn];B[mo];W[mn]C[I heard that following is bad. In this case, is it good?

CZR: This move looks like one too many to me.  He is getting 5th line territory moves for your influence on the right side of the board.  This might be a fair exchange if it was one line lower.  I'd be happy to be Black and respond with moves along the 5th line here.]
;B[lo];W[gq]TR[pn]SQ[pj][qj][pk][qk]C[Do i still need to focus on the bottom right? Should it be bigger the jump? If so how will they respond?

CZR: You still have a weakness (triangle) that you need to fix by making a play around the squares.  See variation.]
(;B[jq]C[R10 invasion is much better than this.];W[mc];B[cq]
C[Now R10 invasion is even more important as you played N17.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr]C[should I play f3 or e4? Or maybe something else?

CZR: No, this is good because you already have G3.];B[ep];W[fq]
;B[bq]
(;W[dr]C[Should I have played b4 instead?

CZR: D2 says I want your corner territory.  B4 says I'll take side territory.  I think the side is worth more, so playing B4 is better.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[ap]C[CZR: The last exchange only helped Black and made you short on liberties.]
;W[eo];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[fn];B[co]
(;W[do]C[Should I have perhaps eaten group e4 instead?

CZR: This looks better than the alternative to me.];B[cr];W[es]
TR[fn][do][eo][bp][cp][dp][gp][eq][fq][gq][fr]C[I heard its better to do this. Is it true in this scenario?

CZR: If you need it for a base, it is good.  But here, it is just worth a couple of points as you're group is large and connected.  Other moves on the board are worth a lot more than a couple of points (R10 for instance.)]
;B[cm]
(;W[dn]C[I was attempting to stop him from playing d6. Perhaps there was a better move.

CZR: Why are you worried about Black playing D6?  See variation.]
(;B[cn]C[Black doesn't need this move.];W[ic]C[SHould I have tenuki? What is a better place?

CZR: You guessed it: R10.];B[qi];W[qk]C[How should I have responded? I didn't want my wall to go to waste.

CZR: Now you will suffer either way.  For the wall not to go to waste, you needed a move here yourself.  If you play below like you do, you are cramped, but if you play above, Black attacks your weakness at Q6.  You lose either way.]
;B[qe];W[pe]C[SHould I have perhaps pincer? I also played this to prevent the laddar from succeeding.

CZR:  I like this choice.];B[qd]C[CZR: Because you already have so many outside stones to work with here, I like the idea of taking R14 and giving Black the corner.]
(;W[qc];B[rc]
(;W[qf]C[Shoul i protect the cut at q17 or tenuki

CZR: This move is trying to get both the corner and the outside.  You chose the corner with R17, so now you have to live with that decision and follow it up with another move there.]
;B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[re]C[perhaps the wrong response];B[rd]
;W[rb]C[maybe s14?];B[rf];W[rg];B[se];W[pg]C[was these two stones the right play

CZR: At least now all your outside stones are in play and working to make a big territory.]
;B[sb];W[oc];B[ob];W[nc];B[qh];W[qg];B[oi];W[ra]C[This move Was an attempt. It failed.]
;B[sc];W[nb];B[sa];W[in]TR[km]C[was this is an accuate postion. What is better

CZR: To me, your best shot at winning relies on taking out the marked group.  To that end, this is not a bad move, but I might prefer something closer (marked).]

(;B[jp];W[ir];B[dm];W[go]C[correct response?
