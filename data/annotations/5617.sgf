C[I am white

Thank you for reviewing! Basically, I was either prone to attacks, or did not handle the attacks correctly. In addition, my playing either didn't leave openings for attacks or I didn't know how to execute them properly. Please help primarily with this attacking and defending from invasions. Of course, any additional comments are appreciated.

*************************************************************************************

Hello, I tried to do my best to comment your game and hope you will forgive my english faults.

Now let's comment the game!]FG[259:]PM[2];B[de];W[dp];B[qd]
;W[dc]C[Right direction?


It seems to me that it is too early to play here, because:

1) the traditionnal order of play commands to play first in the empty corner and to wait the coming development of the game before considering to invade the corner

2) by invading you play Black's game as he hopes you to play there to make pressure on your stones to build a large outside influence while enclosing your stones in the corner

This invasion seems to me equivalent to an invasion at the san-san at the second move of a game]
;B[fd];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[ck]LB[fb:A][eb:B]C[After invading the corner it would be natural for White to slide to A to prevent a black move at B which would enable black to try to build a large moyo on the top border while enclosing the white corner (see variation after)

But the big point in the empty corner also remains]
(;B[pp]C[You can notice now that all the black stones are working together to draw a large moyo and that the white stones are split in two groups and that one of themt is almost enclosed]
;W[jp]LB[oc:A][od:B]C[Direction?

It seems to me that it would be more natural for white to play at A or B to prevent a black shimari (the traditionnal order of play again) and also to split the black moyo]
;B[ci]C[I think that Black should now invade the double wing formation instead of helping White to reinforce is position]

(;W[cn]LB[ek:A]C[It seems to me that this is too flat and I would prefer a move at A to begin to build a box shape moyo :

1) it begins to draw a large white moyo while restricting the former development of the upper black group ,

2) you should not try to protect your group against the invasion at the san-san but should settle it's shape to invite this invasion in the purpose of making a lot of profit when it occurs (see possible variation) and even more profit if it doesn't]
;B[fq]C[After omitting to invade at the san-san Black launches now a much more difficult invasion with this move and will keep a weak group here till the end of the game]
;W[hq];B[fo];W[eq]LB[dq:a]C[I will prefer to play at A because you have strong positions and should avoid contact play not to reinforce your opponent]
;B[er];W[dr];B[ep];W[dq];B[fr];W[mq]C[Too slow?

I don't think so as after the reinforcement of the black group it is now a necessity for white to stabilise his group and this is also an approach move of the opposite black corner]
;B[qn]
(;W[oq]LB[oc:a][pr:b]C[I would prefer to play immediately at A and hope to have later the possibility to slide in the corner at B (see variation).
It seems to me that White 26 kills the aji in the corner.];B[pq]
;W[oc]C[As seen before, this was an urgent move to play and the low approach is a good choice as it should enable white to leave easily in the corner if Black respond with a pincer (see possible variation)]

(;B[pe]LB[nd:a][qi:b]C[This kosumi is a peaceful but powerful move which threatens the white stone (with a possible following at A) while begining to build territory on the right side (with another possible following move at B)]
;W[ld];B[jc];W[fb]C[As seen before, this was an important move to complete the corner invasion but by playing it at this moment you enabled Black to reinforce himself before attacking your upper right group]
;B[gc];W[gb]
(;B[hc]LB[pc:a]C[I would prefer a black move at A to close the corner and make pressure on the white upper right group and maybe to build a huge central influence (see possible variation)]
;W[kf]LB[qb:a]C[It seems to me that it would be more natural for white to first slide in the corner to draw a living base for his group but the black influence in the center is also preocupying]
;B[mc]LB[pc:a]C[It seems to me that this black move will mostly help White to reinforce his group.
I keep on prefering a black move at A to close the corner and make pressure on the white group (it is important to make territory while attaking)]
;W[md];B[lc];W[nd];B[qi];W[pj]
(;B[qj]LB[pi:a]C[Maybe Black could have been less submissive and launch an attack with A if he had not to take care of his weak group in the left bottom corner ? (see possible variation)]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[om];B[hr];W[ir];B[gr];W[iq]LB[hp:a]C[Needed?

Yes, but you could also play at A to protect your default, develop your group and put some pressure on the weak black group]
;B[lq]C[His first attack.]
(;W[kq]LB[lp:a]C[Didn't seal him in, but I could see how else to go.

You could seal him in by playing naturally at A (see possible variation) but your result in the game was also good]

It happens to all of us ;-)];B[nm];W[nl];B[mn];W[ol];B[ln];W[ko]
;B[ll];W[ng]
(;B[nj]LB[pg:a][pc:b]C[I would prefer a black move at A to build territory while making some pressure on the white stones and hope for a following at B, as it seems difficult for White to build a lot of territoty in the center]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[oh];B[mk]C[The invasion ends in gote...]
(;W[ie]LB[qg:a]C[... and a white invasion at A was a natural sanction as it strongly reduces the black right border and threatens in sente the 2 stones in the corner]
;B[pg];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[cl]C[Second big attack]
(;W[cm]LB[bl:a]C[It seems to me that it would have been more natural to play at A to connect the white stones and build territory on the border while making pressure on black's weak group (see possible variations)]
;B[bl];W[dk];B[dl];W[ek];B[el];W[fi];B[gf]LB[hh:a]C[It seems to me that it would be natural for Black to attack at A to draw the white stones through his walls if he has not to take care of that weak group in the left bottom corner]

;B[mb];W[rb];B[rd];W[nc];B[kc]C[I don't think he needed to do this.

Neither do I];W[ih];B[dn];W[cp];B[dm]
(;W[co]C[You don't have to connect as it only costs you a stone and allow you to keep the sente (see possible variation)]
;B[ig];W[jh];B[je]
(;W[bq]C[I was very leary about this point. Justified?

I think that the white group could not be killed and that it was too early for a seki, but it seems to me that the invasion of the corner could be used by Black to obtain a second eye and that your play in the corner is useful to prepare an attack on the black weak group (see possible variations)]

(;W[cr];B[ak]
(;W[aj]LB[al:a]C[Instead of this you could sacrifice a stone at A to have the possibility to try to kill the black group by ko (see variation)]
