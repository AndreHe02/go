AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Comments are labelled by initial and kyu: S13 is B, M8 W, J4 (Jason 4kyu) helped analyse.

My current main concerns are getting two things more-or-less
right, global structure across the board and local shape. Once
I can do that, I'll worry more about tactics for fighting.   pem: You need to improve your tactics too. If you can't keep your
stones connected and alive, your "global structure" will crumble
when the opponent starts cutting and killing.

It is a bit presumptuous for a 13 kyu to aim at Takemaya's
"Cosmic" style, but within my limitations that's what I'm
trying to do.

So my questions are mostly how to build influence rather than
win fights or directly grab territory. Of course I'm also
interested in when to start fighting or solidifying instead.
Certainly I lose a lot by misjudging that!

In analysing this, I noticed an odd move -- 5,5 reply to 6,3
when you have 4,4 star point -- that seems playable. Going
through some variations from there against Jason, it seems
to work.

Comment on that would be of considerable interest. I intend
to try playing it, probably in 9 stone games where the stone
on the middle hoshi makes it look better.

pem: I think it's a bad move that invariable ends up being in the wrong place.

pem: Some general comments:

It's very difficult to comment some parts of this. Some of the variations are
realistic because tactical variations have been overlooked, so they will simply
not happen. (Again, tactics *is* important too. ;-)
But if we look at the strategic side, it's clear from the comments and variations
here hat Black doesn't understand ow to use thickness. A basic rule is:
Don't play close to thickness. (Or trength, or influence, whatever you call it.)
This goes both for your own nd the opponent's. Don't use thickness to build
territory directly, unless the opponent allow you to do that at a very large
scale. Use it to attack the opponent, and thus build territory indirectly, in
another part of the board.];W[nq]
(;B[jq]MA[kp][qn][pn]C[S13: experimental: more threatening than g3, safer than m3? J4: Plays it often.

pem: It's ok. Other alternatives are marked.];W[qn]
(;B[oo]LB[pn:A]C[S13: the only move, if I want to play for outside influence?.
J4: the only move, period.

pem: Well, A (Q6) is an alternative, but it will lead to
complications. At B's level in a handicap game, there's no
reason to play it, so P5 is good.];W[qq]

(;B[gc]LB[cj:A][dj:B]C[S13: my main reason for asking for review.  I like the idea of tenuke here, but can I afford it and is this the right tenuke?

pem: Tenuki is possible. I would prefer C10 or D10, making it a san-ren-sei and double wing from the D4 stone.]

It should be at A (P7).];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq]TR[mp]LB[om:A]

I've never seen it played, or in the few books I've read. Is there some fatal flaw?
J4: hasn't seen it either.

pem: There's a reason for that... ;-)
You'll occasionally see A (O5), but hardly ever without first having a Black stone around B (R10).]

(;B[lq]C[S13: my habitual move in 9-stone games, riskier without the stone at k4.

pem: This is a common misunderstanding. If you have a stone at K4 you should *not* play this. If you want backup, it should be around Q10! But this pincer is still playable even without that.]
;W[no];B[pn];W[fq]LB[kp:A][iq:B]C[S13: Is there a better W move here?

pem: The local joseki move is usually A (L4), but in a handicap game anything is possible. This seems a bit too lose thought, as Black can play a combined extension and pincer at B (J3), so White should perhaps play that point instead.]

(;B[pn]C[S13: a trade. I get territory on right, white on bottom and perhaps corner.

pem: This looks good.])
(;B[oq]C[S13: Good if you want the corner, but I'm trying to play for outside influence.

pem: This is often seen by weaker players, since they learn it early on in high-handicap games. The problem is, that it's an exception. Normally, this kind of move only strengthens White, and still leaves a weakness in the corner.]

(;W[jq]C[S13: proverb, extend 3 from 2 but I suspect too quiet for W here.

pem: This helps White, and it's still possible to invade at R3.

(;AB[jp]TR[jp]LB[pr:A][lq:B]C[pem: If Black already have a stone at K4, this is good because it hinders Whites extension.
In this case, allowing White sliding in with A and then B might be too kind. P3 doesn't secure the corner on its own, but it reduces White's possibilites.]
;W[lp];B[kq];W[mm]LB[qq:A][nr:B]C[pem: There are some variations for White here, but the point is that he's virtually without a base. There's still an invasion at the 3-3 point A, but not while the outside stones are weak. Later in the game (when the prospect of attacking White's stones are gone), closing the corner with B becomes a big gote move for Black. And likewise, when White is secure on the outside, he will invade a A.]
