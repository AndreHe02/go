C[Mark: I'm Mark Schlatter ---- I'll be reviewing your game.  A couple of notes:

1) When I take lessons, I take them from shygost on KGS.  He uses a list (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shygost) which I may refer to during the review.  Even if I don't, it's a great resource to use.

2) I'm about 7 kyu.  I'll try to point out large issues, but I won't catch everything.  I will try to get across basic concepts that should be helpful.

3) You can find me in the go world as mschlat on either KGS or DGS.]
;B[pq]C[creedfox: hello
takesis200: Hi!];W[pd];B[dp];W[pp]C[i thought this move was made too soon. i thought i might be able to make a few defenses in the corner and move to the open one. i decided i had better prospects in the bottom side and decided to defend that.

Mark: Yes, this move is white's is not only too soon, but bad placement.  The proverb is "Never attach against a weak stone".  Q3 is weak, and white has attached.  Your hane (or turn) is very appropriate.]
;B[op]C[Mark: Note that you have a two to one advantage over white in this situation.  You have also chosen side over corner.  I would probably choose the corner --- it's much easier to make territory there.]
;W[po]
(;B[dd];W[fc]
(;B[ec]LB[hc:B][cf:A]C[Mark: When your 4-4 stone is approached, there are three basic options: kick (what you've done here), extend (make a move around A), or pinch (make a move around B).

Of the three, the kick is least useful in this situation.  You are helping white build a wall that they can use later.  In the options below, I've given some ideas of when the kick is useful.  Here I would choose a simple extension or harass the lower right corner.]
;W[jd]
(;B[jp]LB[fd:A]C[Mark: This is a good move in a wide area, but I would want to punish white for playing away.  The branch shows what happens if you play at A.]
;W[ep];B[eq]C[Mark: Great --- again white makes a bad move and again you punish by making the hane.]
;W[fp];B[fq];W[gp];B[dj]LB[dn:A]C[i felt that i could easily take the corner at this point, and that i had more strength on the bottm than him. i decided to try and secure untapped areas.

Mark: This is a good instinct.  However, I wouldn't say the corner is settled.  (For example, how do you respond to C3?)  A move like A does more to settle.

Besides the corners, the left and right are big.  If I were focused on a side, I might take the right since white's group in the lower right looks weak.  I would probably still take the bottom right corner.]
;W[do]
(;B[co]C[Mark: Okay, a double hane.  Let's see how this works for you....]

(;W[dn]
(;B[cm]SQ[cp][dq]C[i made this move realiving that it would probably be cut. i was actually hoping he would. if he cuts the stone, i stil doubted he could take the corner. even if he reduced it, i would have solid power above.

Mark: I am very uncomfortable with this move.  With the two marked cutting points, you are inviting even more.  Note the option where white moves to a cutting point on move 22.  I prefer the stronger move at C6.]

(;W[cn];B[cp];W[bn];B[bm];W[gq];B[gr];W[hr];B[gs];W[hs];B[er]
;W[aq];B[ap];W[bp];B[bo];W[ao];B[bq];W[ap];B[ar];W[an];B[cr]
C[corner went just as planned.

Mark: I'm not convinced this is a good outcome for you.  You took 11 points (with a group that will have little to no impact on the rest of the game) plus sente (since white will probably protect the cut at H3).  Call it about 25-30 points. 

However, white has a strong wall facing both the left and bottom.  White can easily undercut the K4 stone.  In addition, the stones at B7 and C7 have questionable value - they are very close to white thickness and could be captured.

Going way back to moves 17 and 19, I'd advise stronger moves (avoid the cuts) that help the group not be surrounded.]
;W[iq];B[pj]C[i usually would invade on the third line, but feel that a cut on the fourth was fine.

Mark: "Cut"?  You are not cutting any groups.  Moreover, there's nothing to invade.

However, ignoring the terminology, this is a good move.  I think the third line is safer for making a base.  Also, remember you can still move in the lower right.]
;W[oo];B[np]C[this worried me. it was obvious he was forcing me left to build his own stregnth on the right.

Mark: But it's a tradeoff, right?  You each get something.  You just want a little more.

Note that P3 might be stronger.  You really can't count on any territory around M2 since K4 is undercut.  P3 gives natural extensions.]
;W[pl]C[and the fight began.

Mark: Again, not a fight.  Everyone is just sketching territory.  Note that he has not yet dropped down to the third line, so the group is slightly unstable.]

(;B[pg]LB[nc:A][fd:B][qq:C]C[Mark: I think that dropping to the third line would be helpful here.  You do get a base for this group later, but at the cost of strengthening white.  

You could treat Q10 lightly and instead approach at A.  And B and C are still big moves.]
;W[nd]
(;B[qe];W[qd]
(;B[re];W[rd]
(;B[qk];W[ql];B[nf]LB[fd:A][qq:B]C[Mark: This is a slow move --- a small extension from a stable group.  A and B are still big.]
;W[ld]LB[fd:A][qq:B]SQ[jd][fp][gp]C[taking the right seemed all too easy. then i realized the problem. i allowed him to take the entire top side. realizing my foolish mistake, i tried to think of a way to win. i decided that my only option at this point was to try and distract him while slowly surounding the center.

Mark: I still think A and B are bigger.  Controlling the center will be difficult given white's marked stones.]
;B[jq]C[first thing was to secure my position on the bottom. i attacked his wall to mkae him feel like he was squashing me.

Mark: A good idea, but note that you are still undercut.]
(;W[gn]LB[dm:A]C[this worried me. i thought he might be advancing into the center.

Mark: Probably more of an eyespace move.  I think white should have moved at A, weakened the two weak black stones, and set up for territory on the left.]

(;B[aj]C[Mark: The variation is safer.  Note what white can do with your move in the variation to 70.]

(;W[ak];B[bj];W[bk];B[ck]
(;W[df]LB[fd:A]C[i had to be careful here. i had hoped to delay the fighting in this corner until later. if he built a wall around me it would make taking the center very difficult.

Mark: Again, I think taking center is the hardest goal to pursue here.  You can take the bottom right and still move at A to put pressure on the newly placed stone.]

(;B[ce]C[i tried to be as unprovoking as possible.

Mark: But white has to respond here.  C16 is "unprovoking".]

(;W[ee]
(;B[eg]C[i made this move in hopes that he would think i was trying to suround him. once i had a wall here, i would feel safer about fighting in the corner.

Mark: Note the variations to 78 --- your shape in the corner has many cutting points.  White can invade successfully (not that he might want to).]

(;W[ed];B[eb];W[cf]
(;B[be];W[bf]C[he wasn't falling for it. but i was hoping my stone could help me supress his wall.

Mark: I don't follow these comments.  I will note that you are following the same pattern as in the lower left: you build a small corner group while white gets outside influence.  This does not help your cause to take the center.]
;B[gh];W[de]
(;B[cc];W[ae]
(;B[ad];W[af];B[bc]SQ[be][ce]C[Mark: Note that at the end of this exchange, you have saved the two marked stones, but lost sente and not changed the character of your group.  It's alive without the stones.  I believe white has gotten the better of this exchange.]
;W[fb];B[hf]LB[oc:C][rc:B][hd:A]C[Mark: Note that you are trying to take the center, but white has three groups with access to the center.  Securing the center will be very difficult if white plays well.  

It may be time to play moves like A, B, or C to reduce the large area at the top.]
;W[hd];B[hk];W[qq]C[Mark: And here goes your chance to take the corner.]

;B[mn];W[nm];B[nk];W[ol]LB[kf:A]C[at this point i was feeling confident. if i played my cards right i would take a lot of teritory.

Mark: This is a wasted move by white.  Imagine what happens here if white moves at A (that's a serious reduction).  Again, the issue is that you have to stop three encroachments when you try to take the center.]
;B[ok];W[ll];B[lk]C[he managed to cut my forces from each other, but i decided that letting the bottom fight for itself would allow my top area to grow.]

You have typed done.
takesis200: 79.5 to creedfox: 85.0

Mark: Okay, overall you show the beginning of some strong skills, but I would advise working on the following:

1) You've probably heard this before, but the priorities are corner, side, center.  Try in the early game to have influence in the corners that can extend out to the side and center.  (The lower right corner move I suggested is a good idea.)  You did a good job of securing corner groups, but both were small.

2) I've referred several times to the number of cutting points you leave (especially in the left hand corners).  Try making stronger connections that your opponent cannot exploit.

3) In the middle game, don't expect to take the center unless you have an overwhelming advantage.  You suceeded here, but would have had problems against a more experienced opponent.  Look for moves in the corner and sides before looking to the center.

I'd be happy to expand on any of this --- send me email.  And, of course, keep reviewing your games.]
