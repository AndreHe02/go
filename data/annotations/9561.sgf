C[Dear strong player,

Thanks for reviewing this game. We both are serious Go players and do what we can to improve. We always reviews our games, but we would like a review of this game from a stronger player so we can understand how to play better.

The review is for both, but with an emphasis on black since he lost the game by a lot. Black perspective is that white overplayed a bit. If that is true then black couldn't find a way to punish white and he ended being attacked instead. Black's weakest point is that he worries too much about being attacked, instead of attacking himself. He tends towards territorial play. On the other hand, white loves influence and attacking, although he can make overplays often.

We both reviewed the game and have some specific questions, although we appreciate anything you can point outside of the questions.

This was an even game and played at a slow pace, over two hours.

Black's rank is about 3k
White's rank is about 2k

Thank you for your time and effort reviewing this game, we will take your review seriously and will study it thoroughly.

***

Hello! :-)

I call myself HonFu in the GTL and other go places. I am a European amateur 2d, so not that terribly strong ... but I will try my best!

White plays an experimental style in this game. It would be an easy thing to review it like: "This is not in the books, you should do this and that instead." But that would be kind of unfair, because that's why we call it an experiment, right? Because it's not in the books! I will instead try to keep an open mind and interpret the possible meaning of the unconventional moves, always on the lookout for counter measures, hoping that there will be enough insight for the two of you to take home from the review. 

By the way: Both Black and White are "correct" with their general styles: It is hardly possible to worry enough about being attacked, and since go is a territorial game, it makes always sense to actually take territory. On the other hand, influence is a fine thing to have, too, and deserves to be loved and used for attacking. Both attitudes, even to the extreme, find their supporters among the professionals, like it was shown in the eighties between Cho Chikun and Takemiya Masaki.

Why am I saying this? Because we often belittle our own style of play (or that of the opponent or reviewee), saying: You should be more offensive, or more defensive, or more of this or that. I don't think that we learn a lot by aimlessly calibrating our style towards the other extreme from where we are. We would just switch back and forth between slack and overplay without hardly understanding anything. We must instead look into the motives of why we play an overplay or a slack move in the first place.

Why does White play "overplays" (if so)? Because he isn't aware of a weakness! If he was aware of it, OF COURSE he wouldn't play like that (right?)! Why is Black getting pushed around (if so)? Because he isn't aware of an opportunity to counter strike! If he saw it, OBVIOUSLY he'd play it (or so I hope)! So instead of thinking like "I should be this or that instead of what I am", let's rather just increase our awareness on what is happening on the board, let us excavate the hidden possibilities, the missed opportunities, the lost chances, and in light of that, both of your styles, Black's patient territory style and White's enterprising influence style will naturally become sharpened, losing some of their slack or foolhardy extreme points.

As we get deeper into this game, my answers will be less vague and more definite, because after the general setting of the game is layed out, it is again just a normal game of go and becomes mostly about the right strategical aim or the correct technical execution.

So, let's go!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qj]
;B[qm];W[nc]LB[qf:B][qg:A]C[Black thought this was weird, since the stone on the right will be under pressure. We have seen Lee Sedol do this sort of stuff, treating white R10 stone lightly since it would require too many moves to be captured. What do you think about this?

White's aim with this move is to use his other stones in the board to build a moyo.

Hon: Traditionally this would have been called bad, you should make a base at A, or, more recently, with B. Anyway, I have also heard that this is tried occasionally, treating R10 not as a weak, but as a light stone. From personal taste, I would rather be on Black's side, playing conservatively, trying to "punish" White's attempts to mix it up. Which would not be all that easy.

Because if a professional player considers this kind of plays, they can't be too obviously bad, right? Either in the long term this way of playing will be called disadvantageous again (when there's more "data"), or fuseki theory might change and it becomes a new standard ... I am not so much into pro fandom and I also don't know if there is up-to-date theory about this idea, but from what I saw in pros games, most of them still seem to stick to the conventional theory of making bases and the like.]

(;B[qf]C[Making a base

Hon: Not only that, but also preventing White from getting an extension and thereby creating a possible target for attack! A good move in go usually has a defensive and an offensive aspect at the same time.]
;W[ne]LB[jd:A]C[White's purpose is now clear. He wants to develp the top.

Hon: Normally, with that aim in mind, White would take a point like A. This jump rather invites Black to come right in.]
;B[ic]LB[pb:A][jc:B]TR[ne]C[Black chose to play here since if he played  around A (Q18) to protect the corner white would play around B (K16) to develop the top. What do you think?

Hon: This is the normal way of playing from conventional theory. The edge is more valuable than the center, so a black group here will do more than the context-less marked stone. Black has nipped White's moyo in the bud. This would be the "punishment", if we look at it conservatively.

But let us see what White's plan is with this "sacrifice".]
;W[gc]TR[kc][nc][ne][qj]C[Hon: From conventional theory White would prefer the marked spot, to make a base. Of course, after that kind of short extension, the jump would look strange - which would be the "proof" all over, that it was bad to begin with.  

But White seems to treat the two stones as "strength", a wall, thickness. He probably thinks that since Black in the corner is almost surrounded by the three marked stones, the power-balance in this sector is favourable for White. Conventionally the two white groups would be considered as groups without base, which black, with his foothold in the corner, can split and attack.

Obviously we are at a crucial point ot decision, if White's or Black's interpretation is "correct" in the context of this game.]
;B[lc];W[pb]LB[qc:A]C[Black didn't play at A because white could pressure the black group. See variation.]

(;B[md]C[Was this peep ok? would you have left it for later?

Hon: I wouldn't have thought of it in this situation. Peeps are very often bad, so you play them less and less, as you become stronger - up to a point where you have almost forgotten that you can indeed peep sometimes ...

Anyway, from hindsight, your corner group will be pressed hard and White will become thick. Here you kind of initiate that process by helping him getting stronger.]
;W[nd]
(;B[qc]C[White comes back to make a base.

Hon: This would be the normal move ... but it is not completely a normal situation.]
;W[pg]C[Hon: With this move, White combines his two weak groups, becoming stronger in the area and aiming at the group at the top. This should probably have been avoided.]

(;B[pf]TR[pd][qf]C[Is this push ok, or is it crude?

Hon: It is a normal move in many situations, not especially crude technically (the marked stones make solid shape). But in this situation, Black helps White strengthen his influence group towards his own weak stones, so in this case it helps the opponent more than himself.]
;W[ng]C[Black found surprising this jump, now white is connected and black is sealed in. Also white is thick and black's upper group could be attacked. Considering that black was first in this corner this result seems very bad for black. What went wrong for black?

Hon: Black probably should have gotten out before playing at 3-3.

This is a typical combination, often used for reduction. This time, it also has attacking value.]
;B[je]C[Black strengthens the upper group. Whas there a better play?

Hon: Strengthening that group now is reasonable.];W[qb];B[og]
LB[ic:A][qf:B]TR[qb]C[Was this an overplay? Black aim is at dividing the white stones.

Hon: It depends a lot on how alive your corner stones are after Whites push (the marked stone). If you get weak in the process and have to defend later and even lose the cutting stones, then it was an overplay.

There are proverbs like "Make a fist before you strike" or "Don't go on the hunt when your house is burning". They aim at one important aspect of strategy: Do not attack from a weak stance. 

This seems to be true in many competitive sports. In boxing we have to keep our left fist up by all means. From that defensive stance we look for opportunities to attack. If you just storm at the opponent swinging your fists wildly from the beginning, you just risk getting knocked out first. (I am no boxer, but as a spectator this is what seems to be going on.) Or in soccer not all players fly like mosquitos at the enemy keeper, but there has to be a "defense squad" which ensures that there will not be a rebound goal when the enemy gets the ball. (Again, I am no soccer player and also not much of a fan, but I'm sure you see what I am getting at.)

It all comes down to your judgement and your reading of how weak your groups in the vicinity (A and B) really are. If they are strong, a maneuver like this is very feasible; if they are weak, it would be better to first make them stronger, saving the cut for later.

Furthermore you have to consider how weak the enemy groups will be after the cut. After White has pushed in the corner, he has a way to live locally. You might have to profit from attacking the right side group. If that is not possible, then the cut is meaningless in the first place. But let's see.]
;W[of];B[oh];W[qh]
(;B[rb];W[rd]LB[qg:A]TR[og][oh]C[White's aim is at destroying black's shape and to force black to push at A (R13) so he can capture the two marked stones (P13)]

(;B[rc];W[qe];B[oe]LB[pe:C][mf:B][nh:A]TR[og][oh]C[Uponr review we found that this was a terrible move. It helped white to get stronger and now it will be hard for the marked stones (P13) to scape because the turn at A doesn't work any more.

Hon: Also Black lost the possibility to peep at B. Like peeps, where you could cut instead, most ataris are in reality bad moves - They only strengthen the opponent while doing little for yourself! The natural thing, if your opponent threatens to cut like this, is to just connect at C (if it works, that is; if only the atari saves you, then you obviously have no choice).]
;W[nf]
(;B[qg]C[Hon: This atari again helps White a lot.];W[ph];B[pe]
LB[mh:B][nh:A]C[Black still has to come back in gote to protect. Awful. Furthermore, the turn at A will be met with a hane at B now.

Hon: So in hindsight - if you have to connect here anyway, there's no point in playing all these opponent-strengthening moves first!]
;W[ni]C[White connects and he is incredibly strong.]
(;B[he]LB[ie:A]TR[je]C[Black did this to strengthen his group. Was it better to play somewhere else?

Hon: Definitely! 

If Black now feels the need to defend here once more, he should have just jumped to A in the first place. Black has jumped out not just one time, but two times now, it is almost like he has passed once. Also this move does not aim at anything, since White's large knight's move is solid and the wall can not be attacked. This is the kind of mere defense move that we should avoid. Defending is good and necessary - but we should try to also aim at some follow-up at the same time. 

If it is not possible and we just have to play a merely defensive move ... well, then we have to, but then at least one defence move (the marked stone) must do!]

(;W[hd];B[id];W[ge];B[hf];W[gf]LB[hg:A][di:B]TR[je]C[Black really wanted to play A, but he thought that white would play somewhere around B

Hon: Normally, if you get pushed, you extend; but I can also understand why Black wants to get in there now, before White closes it all off. 

He can also excuse his tenuki like this - since the marked stone is there, he does not really have to extend, because the cutting point is already guarded. That excuxe is a bit weak, because if Black could move his stones, he would probably move the marked stone to A now. But anyway, the former redundant double-defence suddenly has been given some meaning - which is probably a reason for White not to play like this but to just tenuki like in my variation.]
;B[ci]LB[hg:A]C[White left A (H13) for later, but he never got to play it. He tought he would come back to play there.

Hon: A is a gote move. You can never be sure if you get the move later, if you don't play it now, the likeliness is 50%. If a move in that region is sente for White, then the likeliness, that he gets it, is 100% (well, something like that). If A was sente for Black, then he could be almost sure of getting it later. That is a very useful and important way of thinking, you should try to adopt it in your games!

But anyway, I think, A is not so important here.];W[cg];B[cl]
;W[dr]
(;B[el]LB[hg:A]C[Blacked played here to strenghten this group since the hane at A (H13) could seal the center in that direction.

Hon: Now, After Black has lived on the left side, the hane will not be doing a lot anymore. (Like I explained on the right side, it will be "influence" that is neither contributing to a moyo nor attacking anything.)]
;W[hq]
(;B[jq]C[Was this reply ok?

Hon: I think it is a bit slow, because Black can not really capture the White stone easily and it's not so valuable for White to capture the black stone at this moment). The most important area was the lower right. White should probably come in there now.]

(;W[fo]LB[gp:A][oq:C][pq:B]C[Black didn't play A because he didn't want white to get more influence outside. On a secnd thought that could have been better than the actual play. See variation.

Hon: I would play B or C now to protect the zone in the lower right from invasion (which would make good use of White's strength in the center) and to make a lot of points in combination with your former move at K3! A move like A has become rather "endgamy", since it is merely about a few points.]

(;B[hp];W[gq]
(;B[eq]C[Mistake by black. Upon review we decided that white should have simply connected  and captured black. See variation.]

(;W[gp]C[White missed the opportunity.];B[dq]C[Hon: Both players don't like to just connect when they get peeped. Although it's almost always correct!

If your opponent plays a move to make you stronger, normally you just say "Why, thank you!", and accept it. Like White did in the upper right. It was good!]

(;W[cp];B[cq];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[ar];W[fr];B[er];W[gr];B[cr]
TR[jp][jq]C[Black lives in gote and he finds his group sealed again.

Hon: In this case living in gote is actually a good result locally, because White was (or should have been) very strong here. But globally the marked stones have become attackable, that is the main problem.]
;W[nq]TR[hp][jp][jq]C[This looked like an overplay to black.

Hon: In a normal situation, yes. But this is a special case!

The marked stones have no base, so White comes in and exploits this. It is the most destructive form of invasion - destroying the enemy's territory potential and attacking at the same time.

What does Black do?]
(;B[pq]
(;W[rh];B[re];W[lq]C[Hon: Maybe better to play on the fourth line for a nimble getaway.]
;B[lo]
(;W[ko]C[Hon: This should be an overplay, since White is almost surrounded, how can he hope this cut leads to anything?

On the other hand, Black is weak too, so it is not so easy ... there might be bad surprises, so it is a matter of reading. If it works, it works.]
;B[kp];W[lp]
(;B[kn]C[Upon review white commented that he was relieved to see that black played a 10k move here, instead of playing strongly. Black really appreciated the strenght of the remark, since he doesn't want to ever play such a bad move. See variation for what we think is better.

Hon: I am no friend of judgments like that - "10k-move". Capturing a cutting stone when you are weak, is one very natural thing to do! If the other, stronger move works, we of course want to play that, but I don't consider this one very bad anyway.]

(;W[no]LB[pn:A][io:B]TR[ko]C[Now white gets good shape and he is getting out.

Black wanted to play at A (Q6), since the ladder of the marked stone (L5) works for black, but he didn't want to have to capture after a move at A (J5)]

(;B[jo]C[Was this a bad play?

Hon: Killing a laddered stone, it is another honte-ish kind of thing to do. The question is just if Black has time for this. He seems to be behind in the game.]
;W[qn];B[pn]TR[no][nq][lp][lq]C[Black think this is the only move since he wants to attack the marked stones (O5)

Hon: The problem is, that there is hardly anything to aim for by attacking. If you don't kill the group, what will you accomplish? The right side is already played out, there is nothing to get. The left side might even become weakish, if things don't work out. The center will at best be neutral.

The underlying principle: Attack is no end in itself, it has to be a means to achieve  something - influence, points, safety, whatever. If there is no merit, don't attack.]
;W[pm]
(;B[qo]C[Another terrible move. We tought that connecting was better. See variation.

Hon: I think it would have been better, but not too much better. White can not be attacked very easily here, whatever you do.]
;W[rn]
(;B[rm];W[on]C[Now white gets this forcing move and he is out.]
;B[po];W[in]C[Suddenly black is under pressure. He was supposed to be attacking, not the other way around.

Hon: This is because, basically, White's invasion of the lower side, using the upper right thickness, creating a target, was a smart action.]
;B[ho]LB[eo:B][go:A]C[Sente because the cut at A (G5) works now after a play at B (E5).]

(;W[go]C[Hon: With this move, White kills off his single stone. It is bad technique.]
;B[hn]TR[in][go][dq][br][ho][cq][cr]C[Trying to get out.

Hon: And at the same time hurting the single White stone - good. This is one of the worst shapes in go - getting sliced through like this. The same thing happened to White in the lower left. 

For the protocol - I don't think that the black group is in a lot of danger. But we should take not even the slightest losses, if we can help it.]
;W[hm]C[Hon: This is not leading to anything.]
(;B[gm];W[fm]
(;B[gn]C[Was this connection ok? Was it better to tenuki?];W[dk]
;B[ck];W[di];B[dj];W[ej];B[cj];W[ei]C[Afer this the hane at A (H13) looks huge for white.

Hon: How huge? The center is already quite played out. If White plays the hane, Black can limit from the bottom, and vice versa. I think, B is bigger.]

(;B[hg];W[ch]C[Hon: This makes a big difference, being sente and creating further potential sente moves.]
;B[ek];W[dm];B[dl];W[hl]
(;B[fl];W[gl];B[nh]C[This whole sequence starting with this move was a misreading by black trying to do a ladder breaker that didn't work.]
;W[mh];B[mi];W[oi];B[im];W[jm];B[il];W[ik]C[Hon: Before we play a ladder breaker, we must really read, because not any move will do! We should read every ladder move by move, at least up to the point where it confronts the enemy. There are a lot of bad surprises.

I think there is a proverb that every move of a ladder that still dies costs you 7 points. I doubt the accuracy of the number, but Black certainly lost a lot here with nothing to show for it.]
;B[io];W[jl]C[Now White is really strong in the center.

Hon: Also his territory potential here has increased.];B[fn]
;W[em];B[en];W[ep];B[bn];W[jr]LB[ir:A]C[This looks dangerous for white because he will loose the eye at A (J2). Was this an overplay? We think white should have played A himself.

Hon: A looks like the normal thing to do. Also I don't really see what is the benefit of this one - what does it accomplish compared to A?]
;B[ir];W[kr];B[iq]LB[ls:A]C[Hon: The question if it was an overplay left aside, White lost the points to the left that he gained on the right. Could as well have played the safe move!]
;W[bm];B[eo];W[fp]
(;B[bl];W[bo];B[an]
(;W[am]C[Hon: Mistake!]
(;B[cm];W[ao]LB[do:B][aq:A]C[A and B are miai and black still has to connect. Bad for black again. Black wanted to finish in sente to be able to invade the upper left.

Hon: Black, but also White, must concentrate more on finding a good variation in a local fight. Often it is not even hard to read out something that works, you just have to ... well ... get around to actually do it. I showed some variations of capturing races, that might be hard to evaluate while in a game, but if for example it is just about getting sente - that branch of the tree is only three moves deep. I am sure Black can read that!

So why is it that sometimes we don't do it? Because we get carried away. Or because we've been carrying on the bad habit of guessing moves from our beginner's days, where we could not do more than guessing. Even in a slow game, there are moments where we play too quickly, although we shouldn't. The most dangerous idea in a game of go is: "Ah well, it will work out somehow." I heard even 4ds complain about having thought that and consequently losing a game.

So do read! Always! Both of you are strong enough for it. When you're afraid or angry or confused, take a moment, stand up, breathe deeply - and then calmly read it out!]

(;B[dn];W[cc]C[Now white defends and gets a huge corner.];B[do]
;W[aq];B[al];W[is];B[hs];W[js];B[hr];W[co]C[Hon: There is nothing left to attack, the rest will be endgame. 

Even estimating the position very conservatively, White is more than ten points ahead, so the game is clearly lost.

White was successful with his unconventional opening, but we can't tell for sure, because Black helped his opponent, first letting him connect the two potentially weak groups in the upper right, then starting a fruitless cutting operation, making White very strong. After that, the invasion of the lower side was to be expected. White suffered a little drawback, losing his lower left, but on the other hand it was sente for him, so he got the opportunity to split Black at the bottom and destroy a lot of potential. Black's last shot at victory would have been getting sente in the lower left, then somehow invading the upper left successfully, which would have been not easy. 

I hope this review was helpful for both of you. I wish you success with your studies!]

Please note - in 99% of cases, Black would defend at the marked spot, but here it seems more important to prevent a disruption of the lower right. If White cuts now, Black can flee to his other group with his three stones.

Black is behind anyway, because he played too many moves at the top and strengthened White for no gain in the upper right.]

))
(;B[pi]LB[qc:A]TR[qf]C[Hon: I am not sure about the exact maneuver I'd choose, but I think I would now get out with this kind of move. 

Black splits the groups, isolating the R10-stone, who refused to get a base earlier, and as long as A is open, White might come under fire there, too, later, if Black gets to play at that point first. If White is split and has safety issues, then in turn the black group at the top becomes that much more strong. Also it is harder for White to think about invading the bottom. Black is doing all this, while staying connected himself (to the marked stone); in the game Black still cuts, but he will also be cut off, which is much less convenient.

(In Go we can not just look at one group and define how strong it is; the important thing is to judge the strength of several opposing groups in relation to each other. An eyeless wormish group for example can be weak (when it bathes in a sea of enemy influence) or strong (when it cuts two equally weak enemy groups). We need to acquire this kind of "whole-board" sense of what is going on, focussing on strength and weakness issues.)

Anyway, I think, if Black is going to "punish" White, he has to separate White and make Whites tenuki on the right side tell. If White gets strong here anyway, then obviously he was "wise" not to defend in the first place.]

(;B[mc];W[md];B[nb]C[Hon: Maybe this maneuver is better in this case, getting more eyespace in sente while attacking White's shape.]
;W[oc];B[qh]C[Hon: The white wall is not really doing a lot. 

How can we see if a wall is "doing a lot" or not? By principle, a wall should either be a part of a sufficiently large moyo structure (see example in the variations), or it should be used to attack a weak group (see other example); both is not possible here.]
;AW[qe][pj][pc][pd][pe]AB[qd][ob][pb]AE[qf][qh][qj][qm]C[Hon: Wall as part of a moyo structure.]
;AW[qk]AB[qi]AE[pj]TR[qi]C[Hon: Wall as a means to attack the marked stone. White will not get points here, but he will make new influence with his pincer stone and afterwards for example use it to disrupt the bottom.

In my variation (move 25) Black is solid everywhere in the vicinity of the White wall, so there is no moyo and no attack. That's why the wall there is "not doing a lot". The mere territory effect of a wall, if there is no moyo or weak groups involved, is rather small.]
