C[Hello dear reviewer,

Im a 4k playing W against a 2k.

I think I made a lot of reading mistakes in the game, which led ultimatively to the loss. However, I think my basic strategic decisions (and evaluation of Bs strategic mistakes) were right. It would be great if you could comment on whether my choices and assumptions are correct and highlight where I could play better moves.

Many thanks for reviewing!

Dear Para,

I wrote some comments to the best of my knowledge, I hope you find something in them. I am very uneasy with "correct strategy that fails due to mere tactical mistakes", it happens, but usually it is an excuse. Especially in a turn-based game. Proper reading, judgement of life and death and thus urgency of play are a crucial part of making the correct choices strategically.

(;B[oc]C[Could not understand this move. this move looks almost like tenuki to me. What is the reasoning? did I miss something?

[ni][oi][pi][qi][ri]C[Looking at the current situation, it looks quite grim for W. W has no significant territory nor influence, and is behind big time. The idea which struck me was to somehow attack the triangle group, which is still heavy and eyeless. However, W has no stones on the bottom and there is currently no possibility to attack them, yet. Apart from A and B, I couldn't detect any significant weaknesses in Bs structures. I decided to go for B, but was ready to shift the attack to A if it should go badly. Is my analysis correct? anything to add?

tapir: A move at C looks like it would have made a lot of difference to strength situation. Exchanging D for E helped Black settle on the left as well. Saving grace is that Black played at G.]

;W[ii]C[I was very content whith the result! B has now two weak, eyeless groups. and the initial invasion stone is connected to a, almost, living corner.

tapir: I don't like it. Where is the second eyeless Black group? There would have been calmer ways to keep Black separated without producing 2 weak cutting groups yourself. Since you will have to defend the cutting stones, Black is stronger than it looks or could be with different play.]
