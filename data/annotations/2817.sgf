C[*X*: Reviewer's comments prefixed by *X* for Xopods, my KGS/IGS/DGS username.  I will remind you that it's generally best to send in games that you lost for review.  However, at your level it's likely that both sides made enough mistakes to be worth reviewing.

Hope the review is of use.

hi, I won this game by 50 points, but I think it still meets the criterion of a good game due to the big fight in the middle game, it could have gone either way, is my opinion.

hoang-];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[qg]C[too agressive on my part...

----

*X*: Bad for two reasons.  In a way, it's too aggressive, in that it leaves you with two weak groups, while the Black corner is a bit more stable.  However, it's also bad if you're trying to attack, since contact moves are for defense.  Besides, Black has a strong response at Q13.  

Joseki here would be the slide at Q18 (leading to the same as bottom left but with colors reversed) or playing lightly by extending to K16, at which point that joseki terminates.]
;B[pg]C[*X*: Good by Black.]
(;W[qh]C[*X*: You're going to have trouble dealing with two weak groups, so maybe you should play lightly with the sabaki-ish counter-hane Q12.  At the very least, you'll succeed in complicating matters and confusing your opponent.

(see variation)];B[ph];W[qi]C[i'm happy with this...  i wanted to aim at the lower corner and take the side later.

----

*X*: It's not terrible, but Black has lots of good things to do now, like descending at S14, Making a combination extension-attack at e.g. R8, and attacking the lone White stone on top.  The three white stones on the right are not as strong as they look.]
;B[fc]C[hmmm i wanted to q18 but i didnt want to let b have two moves in the upperleft corner

----

*X*: Terrible, terrible move by Black.  Now White can play a wide pincer at e.g. K17 that also reinforces the lone White stone on top.  This should be at e.g. L17.]
;W[cg]C[seems far, i was expecting the d18

----

*X*: Arrrrrgh.  Missing your chance.  K17!

Anyway, you shouldn't expect D18 here.  D18 is pretty standard in response to a small knight's extension (C14, not C13) but when the large knight's extension is made, as here, it is the corner invasion C17 that the joseki books recommend. 

However, as Black, I would play something like K17 myself, for the same reason that you should play it as White... it reinforces one person's lone stone on top while reinforcing the other.  Note the almost-symmetry of the situation.  Those stones should be the primary focus at this point, and both players are completely ignoring the direction of play.]
;B[cc]C[it didnt come..];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce]C[maybe d15 was better then this

----

*X*: D15 is more solid, but I think this is playable.];B[db]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[fb];W[ea]C[*X*: I like F19 better, but it's a minor point.]
;B[be];W[cf]C[*X*: Right.  Hane at B14 would be bad.];B[bf]
;W[pb]C[*X*: I'd still prefer K17 or K16.];B[qc]C[*X*: Black should ignore Q18 and play K17 instead.  Either R17 or L17 settle the White group, but L17 also denies Black F17-18 their ideal extension at K17.]
;W[kc];B[ic]C[*X*: Black has missed his opportunity.  White is better at this point, in my opinion.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fe]C[*X*: White is overconcentrated.  I would prefer to attack from the other side and press Black against the wall.  Remember the proverb, "Don't use thickness for territory."]
;B[ch]C[*X*: Strange move by Black.];W[bg]C[*X*: The obvious response, making C13 seem kind of ridiculous.]
;B[ck]C[*X*: Black obviously thinks he's making a base.  The two point jump doesn't count as a base though when it's undercut by B13, and definitely not when it's in contact with white stones like C13.  White's lead is increasing.]
;W[bl]C[*X* I don't like this.  Seems to reduce potential to attack these White stones in future.  Better to attack on a larger scale with something like a capping move at E9 maybe.  But rather than doing something here immediately, I think the right side is urgent.  Maybe R6.  It's a weird position that you wouldn't see stronger players getting into often, so I'm not really sure what's best.]
;B[mq]C[*X*: Good by Black to treat the stones on the left lightly.  White needs to do something about the bottom side.]
;W[fk]C[*X*: Not bad, but maybe a little vague.];B[ei]
(;W[fh]C[*X*: I don't like this.  G11 would be a good move because it's both a knight's move attack and a capping attack (see James Davies' "Attack and Defense").  It also drives black towards your thickness.]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[gh];W[gj];B[bh]C[*X*: Clearly bad by Black, because it's gote.]
;W[af];B[ad];W[fg];B[ef];W[ff];B[ae];W[ag];B[de];W[df];B[dg]
;W[ee];B[ah];W[eg];B[cl]C[what should i do? i might be able to kill the corner what about that side....  can it die?  its very ifffyy because i didnt see a sequence so i attacked the corner

---

*X*: Side can probably escape now, but the corner is ko or seki (see variations).  I can't find a way to kill the corner unconditionally.  This is okay, though, because attacking the side group gives enough ko threats that either the corner or the side will die for sure.]

(;W[ac];B[bd];W[bb];B[ba];W[da];B[ab];W[aa]C[maybe there was a different variation without ko...  i wonder

----

*X*: I wonder too.  I played with a bunch of variations, but ko is the best I can find also.]
;B[bm];W[ca]C[i thought to myself before taking the ko, can i do anything down there?  would it make a huge difference?  do i have ko threats that is greater than the corner?  the answers to these told me to kill the corner

----

*X*: You did the right thing, since the side is now alive.  The only thing you have to worry about now is that your lower left corner can be attacked.]

(;B[bn]C[*X*: Aji keshi.  Black should push once at C3 and then leave the aji of B4.]
;W[bo];B[cm]
(;W[en]C[*X*: Although this allows Black to capture B5 and leave you eyeless (and my first instinct would have been to play D6 instead), after a very little bit of analysis, I think this may be correct. (see variations on this move and previous)]

(;B[dn];W[co];B[do];W[eo];B[dm];W[eq];B[fp]C[run before living is my thought, but i may not be doing the running the most effective way.

*X*: Looks okay to me.  Black's play is bad.];W[ep];B[er];W[gn]
C[*X*: Good.  This is much better for White than the variation I showed, due to bad play by Black.]
;B[fm];W[em];B[fn];W[fo];B[el]
(;W[gm]C[*X*: Wrong direction to play atari.  These stones can be captured (see variation)]
;B[fl];W[ho]C[maybe g4 better it threatens to lower b stones i think! :)

----

*X*: Yes.  Either G4 or solid connection G5 better.];B[gl];W[gp]
;B[gq];W[ip]C[my thought here is b is trying to harrass me and take the g10 stones and move out into the center, because he cant profit on the bottom so well from me running, he is already there.... so i say keep running hard to make cash in the center anyway ill allow it!  give him what he wants.

----

*X*: You still have an invasion point at L3.  If you allow Black to fix that, you give him large profit.  Play e.g. H8 or R6 now and leave L3 for later.  J4 is bad.]
;B[hl]TR[gi][gj][fk]C[*X*: Small for Black, because you've been treating the marked stones lightly.  Black should K4.]

(;W[im]C[*X*: Both of you are missing the direction of play again.  You should play K3 and double hane (see var).]
;B[hi];W[hh];B[ih];W[hg];B[hj];W[jj]C[*X*: I don't understand the purpose of this move.  What were you trying to accomplish?]
;B[ji]C[*X*: I guess you meant it as kikashi and Black treated it as such, but the one stone J12 is much too small to worry about, since it isn't doing anything.  Black should have just ignored K10 and played  K4 or e.g. R9 or done something about his weak group on top which is (and has been for a while) in mortal danger.]
;W[ij]
(;B[hk]C[*X*: Bad.  If Black is going to continue playing here, connecting at J11, not H9 is correct.]
;W[ii];B[jh]C[*X*: Better for Black to treat these stones lightly.  Still not seeing the correct direction of play.]
;W[kj];B[jl];W[lg]C[*X*: Maybe better to play a splitting attack on these three stones and the ones at the top, at e.g. J15?  Unless you think you can let them connect and swallow all of them together...]
;B[jf];W[jd];B[ie];W[id];B[lh];W[mh];B[li];W[lj];B[mi]
(;W[qq]C[maybe a little hasty?  seems r6 working together with r11 maybe be better but if he pincers.....

----

*X*: Incorrect direction of play.  You're right that doing something about the three stones on the right is important, but even R6 would be wrong because right now, the attack you had going in the middle is more urgent.  The marked White stones are very weak.  Attacking while reinforcing them would be good, and you can even help out the right side in the process.  Also keep in mind H16 for later, because if he gets to play H15, he saves a lot of stones, assuming his centre group lives.

I like N9, personally.  O9 was my first instinct, but it can be cut.]
;B[qk]C[ahh what to do ~~~

*X*: It's what you get for leaving weak groups all over the place.  You have two very weak groups (center and right) and the bottom left is still not unconditionally alive, because G5 is false.]
;W[pj]C[seems weak this kosumi

*X*: Moving out is about the only thing you can do, unless you want to try some kind of sacrifice.  I can't object to this move.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq]
(;W[rp]C[*X*: This is wrong.  See var.];B[ml]C[mistake by b, if he s5, i think i might have had a hard time living in the corner!  i'm not so great with making two eyes in corners~~  maybe you can show me a variation where i can live!

*X*: 3-3 invasion with ogeima from the hoshi lives. Very similar to normal 3-3 joseki.  You played hane too early. See variation a few moves back.]

(;W[ni]C[ahh this isnt the best move i think, maybe p10 where o11 and o9 become miai?

----

*X*: I think O9 would save your middle stones.  P10 doesn't work because Black can still connect at K9.  The reason O9 works is because it makes miai of capturing a stone and connecting, or making seki.]
;B[oj];W[nk]C[ahh geez serious mistake~!  i should have thought for at least a few seconds

*X*: Yes.  I don't need to comment on this, except to say that stupid mistakes like this can happen to anyone.]
;B[pk];W[kh]C[i saw this variation in my mind so i went for it!

*X*: Nice.  I didn't even see it.  Clearly the game winning move, since the difference between this, saving your middle stones and wiping out the upper side completely, and Black killing your middle stones and saving the top side is very large indeed.]
;B[ki];W[jg];B[kg];W[ig];B[nh];W[kh]C[*X*: Black should just resign at this point.  No further comments, except one at move 311.  Both players played a bad yose, Black trying to save unconditionally dead stones, and White wasting moves "overkilling" groups that were already dead.  Hard to comment on yose, except to say, "Study how to calculate the value of moves, look at the whole board and take the biggest move." (there's a lot about calculating the value of engame moves at Sensei's Library, a partner site of GTL)]

*X*: If Black captures those three stones, you must defend at T6 or else Black T6 kills the whole group.  Therefore, you cannot play the ko.  Even if you could, it's better to save three stones than to threaten to kill 5 in ko, unless you're sure you can win the ko without ignoring a ko threat.]

Keep in mind that you still have a very severe move at K3, and you can swallow four stones at H16 any time you want.]
