C[B: This is my first 13x13 game, after a few 9x9 games. I play online only, about a few games per week and I started three weeks ago learning from books. I was black.

This is my first review adn I loved doing it. It was more fun than I thought.
In the overall view of the game, you can see that white comes out of all fights with sente. This is blacks main problem. Black is over protecting his groups and territories.

I hope you will enjoy reading it,
Mans Ullerstam];B[jd];W[dj];B[jk];W[ed];B[df];W[de]C[B: White comes to contact, I am surprized.
w C9 better ?]
(;C[I agree that C9 is better, but this move is also good for white.]
;B[ce]C[This is dangerous due to C10, C7, E8];W[ef];B[dd];W[ee]
;B[cd]C[this is the reaction I expected. From
now on I ask myself how to react to a
hane on d11.
I would have played at D11 at this time, to get a bigger corner.]
;W[cf]C[B: .... but it doesn't come, and I decide to sacrifice d8 to establish firmly in
upper corner. Perhaps I was already   firm over there, I don't know...]
;B[bf];W[dg]
(;B[ae]C[This is unneccessary. You don't have to play in this corner at all if you want.
But if you will, play at B7 or E11 instead.
Now you gave white sente for no reason.];W[bg];B[eb]C[B: with e12, I intended to secured definitely the corner. I thought   white would not insist then, but he did.
This is unneccessary for the corner. If you want to play here, you should just play the easier E11.]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb];B[cb];W[bd];B[db];W[ac];B[cc]
C[B: at this stage, I think I had a firm position in upper left. I didn't really intend to invade, but I succeeded. I don't know if it cost me too much. In my opinion the contact fighting up there happened much too quickly.
This was great for you. Now the upper side is still open from the left and you are the strong one.]
;W[ke]C[B:What is black's best answer here ?];B[kd]C[This is the best answer.]
;W[je]
(;B[le]TR[ed][ee][ef]C[bad wrong ? I re-read "Learn to play Go II", page 23: they recommend to hit the head of the stones opposite to the edge. I hit from the edge, pushing
the white stones to their marked stones, but my idea is to seal the corner, playing m11 after, eventually getting the upper edge...
Yes this is bad. Once again you had nothing to protect you were already in perfect shape in the corner.]
;W[lf];B[md];W[id]C[This is dangerous for white.];B[kf]C[B L8 Bad move ?
Variations ?
Good move. It is white who makes bad moves after this. He has to sacrifice his stone at M8 now.]

(;W[kg];B[jf];W[ie];B[lg];W[lh];B[mf]C[So far so good, now your playing get's tricky from both sides.]
;W[ig]C[I think this is very dangerous for white, but I guess he was desperate and also he is securing more and more of the center.]

(;W[kj];B[kk];W[jj];B[ij];W[lk]TR[kj][jj][ki][kh][kg][lh]C[Can B kill the growing W group there ?
Yes, white is dead if you play right.];B[lj]C[This is the right start.]
;W[li];B[mj];W[mk]C[Now you can kill him.]
(;B[mh];W[mi];B[mg];W[kl]C[After this move white lives.];B[il]
C[This could have been on K2, which would force white to answer in the corner.]
;W[jl];B[ik];W[gk]C[
>From here on I was lost: what were the
best strategic options ?
Basically you have lost the game here. There is a serious danger if white cuts at J5, but he doesn't.]

(;B[gl]C[This doesn't lead to anything and you still have the cut to worry about.]
;W[fl];B[hk];W[hi];B[ch]C[This is dangerous. If white plays at J5, the whole bottom black group is dead.]
;W[ii]C[He does.];B[cg]C[But you answered it correctly.];W[df]
;B[cj];W[di];B[dh];W[eh]C[
 MiGo 29k : black d6 small, I guess cannot think of anything better...
 newtogo 25k*: how long have you been playing?
 MiGo 29k : three weeks, mainly reading books and playing with Igowin on a 9x9 or a few with my young (4 and 6 ) kids, that's all]
;B[gj]C[This is of no use. I understand that you did it, I guess it was the best way to try to save your group.
But you actually have to play at C5.];W[fk]C[What follows now is a hard fight which white wins. After that there is no use of playing.]

 newtogo 25k*: i started in nov];B[ih];W[fi];B[ek];W[dk]C[
 MiGo 29k : how old are you ? i'm 34 (pretty old, mmh ?)];B[el]
;W[hj]C[
 MiGo 29k : I must be blind...
 newtogo 25k*: older than that which is why i am not learning this game too fast!
 MiGo 29k : MiGo laughs, nice to find someone having it difficult like me :)]

(;B[if]C[I would have done this.];W[hf];B[hg];W[gg];B[hh];W[gf]

C[White has to play like this to save  his stone at G3.
Now you are alive in the corner.
Time to make the upper right bigger.];B[ic];W[hc];B[ib]))
(;B[ll]C[By playing here.];W[mi];B[ik]C[Now white cannot kill your groups and cannot make two eyes.
White is dead.
Let me show you why he can't make an eye in the corner.];W[ml]
;B[kl];W[lm];B[km]C[It's a false eye.
And the same above];W[mg];B[lf]C[Now white has three eyes, but two are false.]

(;W[kk]C[I think white can live if he does like this.];B[kj]
;W[lj];B[jj];W[kl]))
(;B[kh]C[I would have chosen this simpler way of gaining more territory, but the way you did it can be far more rewarding if you managed to kill white.]
;W[jg];B[ki]))
(;W[jf]C[This is how white should sacfrifice his stone, by making a strong outer wall and securing territory in the center.]
;B[kg];W[jg];B[kh]))
(;B[gd]C[If you want to play on this side you should have played here.
This secures the connection between the upper right and left and also a big territory.
After a move like that you are in the lead with territory.
But I think I would have played somewhere in the bottom right instead.]
))
(;B[fk]C[This is where I would play instead.
This is sente and has to be answered by white.
Maybe at E3];W[ek];B[fj]))
(;B[cf]C[I think this is better for you.];W[ce]C[After this I would have played at F8 or around C5.]
