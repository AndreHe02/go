C[v:  The big question I have for this game is why did it fall apart so quickly.  Sometimes you get a feeling your opponent is a little stronger than advertised.  But then I probably didn't help myself either.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg]C[janr: so far everything is normal]
;B[ol]C[janr: it is more common to play tenuki first.  There are many big points on the third and fourth line open.]
;W[jq]LB[og:A]C[v: It seemed to slow to play again for the R13 stones but without a move they perhaps become an easy target.
janr: playing A is good, but the game move is also big.];B[og]
(;W[oi]LB[oj:A]C[janr: jumping at A is better   Alternatively, how about making eye space as in the variation first?]
;B[ph];W[qi];B[pi];W[pj];B[oj]C[janr: given that black can not keep white inside, the cut is unreasoable and makes him weaker.]
;W[ok];B[nj];W[pl];B[pm];W[pk];B[om];W[nk];B[mj];W[mk];B[lq]
LB[lj:A][qm:B][qq:C]C[v: Already B has 2 strong corners.  The game is already over!
janr: I wouldn't agree here.  Being able to play A is very good for white.  It gives him influence while preventing any moyo option for black and making his right-side group stable.  There is still the cut at B or the invasion around C.  At the same time, white still has two untouched corners]
;W[lj];B[nh];W[li];B[mh];W[lm];B[hq]C[janr: there is so much open space on the left and the top, so why does black play here?]
;W[jo]LB[ip:A][fq:B]C[janr: I would prefer B (taking territory while attacking).  Locally, A is an alternative to the game move which prevents black from connecting.]
;B[dr]C[janr: black is very low.]

(;W[cn]C[janr: how about the variation?];B[fr];W[gr]C[janr: this move doesnt work]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[gq];W[fp];B[hr]C[janr: this move is redundant. white's stone can't escape.  white now has time to make the moyo on the left side.]
;W[nq];B[mp]
(;W[ho]LB[nq:A]C[janr: it's better not to play at A if you intend to play tenuki.]
;B[np];W[di];B[fc];W[fd];B[ec]C[janr: I prefer hane here.];W[ed]
;B[gd];W[ge]C[v: You can see I'm trying to build a competing moyo to stay in the game.]
;B[hd];W[he];B[dc];W[cc]LB[cd:A]C[janr: extending to A may be more solid.]
;B[id];W[jf];B[ce]C[v: and this is where it starts to fall apart.  I can't afford B to live in here.  But B probably cant afford for B not to live here either.
janr: B allowed whites moyo to grow too big and solid.  If black would cut, then white would give him the corner.However, peeping like this and letting white connect cannot be good.]
;W[cd]C[janr: white is very solid.];B[ci];W[ch]C[v: the wrong side to hane?]
;B[cj]C[janr: how about black's crosscut?];W[dh];B[ie];W[if]

;B[op];W[kq];B[lr]C[v:  since this failed miserably I resigned here.
janr: globally, I think white should be a bit more careful in reading (life and death helps a lot), and avoid to answer only the opponents moves.]
