Please note that I am very candid while commenting.  I believe that is
most educational.  I am trying to instill philosophy as much as specific
moves.  No maliciousness or insult is
intended.]US[Brought to you by IGS]GN[ran-lg9d(B) IGS]RE[B+Time]PW[ran]

6 is not joseki.  In addition, it is terrible.  Black takes the vital
point.  See variations.]
(;W[pm];B[qn];W[pn];B[pp]C[Again black
takes the vital point.  White 10 should be at b.  My prediction without
having looked at the rest of the game is that black is at least 3 stones
stronger than white.]

  Wow!  fast game...];W[jp]C[The corner is bigger than white 12.
The hane at the head of three stones (b) is also very big.  The
possibility of playing black c remains, so white 10 seems inefficient.]

 lg9d 14k*: is entering byo-yomi
  Black's first inefficeint move is 21.  It is joseki, but it doesn't work
well with D17, as they are both low and do not build a dynamic moyo.  This
means that black chose the wrong joseki.  Perhaps a one space low pincer
would have worked better than the one space jump at
15.];B[jc];W[qk];B[ql]C[Whoa!    White 24 is
terrible.  Nasty, greedy, white player.  Shame.  You cannot/shouldn't try
to take territiory that is rightfully black's.  (not yet, anyway).
Build your own first, thenake their'ss small, small, D15 is the only move
(well, D10 might be OK).  Prevent black from playing at C10 or D15 or
maybe even both!]
(;W[lc];B[kd]C[white's next three moves are
uncoordinated, almost as if white is throwing dice to decide where to
move.  Moves must be made with a plan in mind.  M17 is a complete waste
unless white has an answer to L16.  Therefore, having made a bad move,
white must live with this stone or black will end up better off with
nothing to show for white.  Living will be difficult, so white plays H17
perhaps to help.  If so, better to play H17 first, but better yet to play
elsewhere.];W[hc];B[ld];W[cd]C[28 is not
joseki...

I was wrong.  I didn't expect black to cut.];W[eq]C[black 39
seems too close to white's strength.  b, for example, feels better.]
(;B[cm];W[dj]C[black 41 is a very low move and should be
rejected at this stage in the game.  b or c seem more consistent.  Playing
lightly at c here feels good.  Black has a large territorial lead, so only
needs a light reduction of white to win.]

weakness.  No time for anything else unless it's big time sente.]

48];B[ck];W[dl];B[bn];W[dm];B[cn]C[through
53 a strange set of moves that give black a very low position and give
white center influence.  White could get a very large center territory,
but there are several defects in white's wall.  So strategically, white
had the right idea, but made some tactical mistakes.  White has a lost
game unless the center turns into a vast territory.  Not
likely.];W[gp];B[dk]C[Black begins to exploit the defects
and lock in a win.];W[ek];B[di]C[57 is wrong, giving
white a chance to sacrifice a stone and fix the wall's defects....];W[ei]
;B[cj];W[ej]C[white's wall looks much nicer
now.];B[dn]C[

  b looks playable.  Now white will get a big chunk of the center.  Probably
not enough, but considering what has gone on before, nothing to be ashamed
of.]
(;W[bp];B[en];W[or];B[pr]C[64 and 65
are both small and besides, white really needs to play at b now, so 64 is
mostly gotably better to pat b in t place.  0 moves fro!]

feeling very clever!  Got that nice snap-back hunh?  Cause you outsmarted
ole' white?  WRONG!  You got had.  You just got 6 points in gote.  That's
much smaller than 71, for example.
     Even so, white shoiuld have played 66 at 67 to prevent
this.];W[rb]C[

  White 70 should be at 71 obviously.  Perhaps white's finger slipped and
hit the wrong space while
