C[Hi, I wish to know how to make better use of my stones in the board. The result is close, although many mistakes were made in the game. I played B and I guess, I took little advantage of my opponents blunder at the begining of the game, I would appreciate some advice and ideas, thanks.

Alberto];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[po]C[I still don't know if it should be better to play a large pincer at O8. I guess that makes a very different game.
JH : Both are possible but taking the third corner is also very possible]

(;B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[qq]C[I think this is a mistake of W, I am not sure if B punished it enough.
Yes. It looks like an overplay.];B[oq]C[Very good];W[qn]
(;B[rq];W[pn];B[pj]C[I am not sure this is correct, I played here to put some more pressure on W, by impeding an extension to the side, and pushing the group along the 5th line
OK. Black is good];W[mo];B[lp]C[No need to play such a move with a lot of aji. Why not in the open corner. This is greedy.]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[mp]LB[nq:a]C[The tesuji move for white is at "a"]
;B[mq];W[lq];B[kq];W[nq]C[This sequence is not so good for White. Escaping is better.]
;B[lr]C[The worst sequence for White.];W[mr];B[lo]C[Just connecting seems good enough]
;W[lq];B[ep]C[I thought this exchange was a little favourable for B]
;W[mq]C[Connecting this ko seems too slow for White];B[jp];W[dj]
;B[fc];W[ic];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]
;B[cf];W[co];B[cp]LB[cq:A]C[This is the first weak move. Playing at san-san A is normal]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[bn];B[do];W[dn];B[en];W[dm];B[lc];W[qd];B[qe]
C[I do not know if blocking along this side was correct.
JH : I will suggest blocking the corner.];W[re];B[qc];W[rd]
;B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[qb]LB[pc:A]C[Here I thought for a while, Maybe I should have just sealed white in the corner and keep my outer stones connected, but I thought I would be giving up too much territory.
JH : this very greedy : White should have cut at  A. So you should be very happy by playing there.]
;B[rc];W[pc];B[pb];W[oc];B[rb];W[ob];B[qa];W[md]C[I didn't expect this follow-up, and it seems to me that W got the better for the exchange, an invasion on the upper left side appears to be urgent for me.
JH :True but the exchange is almost fair. I do not see why Black should loose this game.]
;B[oe];W[ld]
(;B[df]C[I am not sure that this was a good move, I thought it was big enough to keep my upper left group solid and important for start reducing W's moyo in the upper side.
Maybe the alternative of BF18-Bf16 would have been better, but I am not sure if W would put too much pressure on the invading group.
JH : D14 is not so bad. Why not E7 ? I think the game would be simpler and good for Black]
;W[fd];B[gd]C[N73 : You want a lot. Now E7 is clearly better]
;W[gc];B[fe];W[fb]C[White is playing too conservatively.];B[ef]
C[I think this is not severe enough for B, although solidly connected B lost sente.
Locally, this sequence is not so bad but this wall is not very usefull.]
;W[mh]C[I did not understand this move.
I phantasized that W would prepare an invasion at R11on the right side by threatening to connect his stones from the upper right side to the lower right side or to the center
Me too : this move is an UFO.
For White F5 and H5 or G7];B[rg]LB[qk:A]C[I feel a little ashamed of this move, it seems to tight. I wanted to eliminate all aji around the right side at once, to prepare to fight back against W78. i guess this move is bad because it has a very small purpose.

You know your worst move . You should play at A for the same purpose]
;W[bq];B[br]C[Not so big. You had better play E7];W[hp]C[I think this is a little bit of an overplay of W.
But White is behind and should do something.];B[go];W[io];B[jn]
;W[in];B[im]C[I felt I was forced to fight, otherwise I would loose.]
;W[hm];B[hn]C[This is optimistic. It is difficult to find a good move. So 83 and 85 were too much. Boshi at 89 is usual instead of 83.]
;W[jm];B[il];W[dr]
(;B[er]C[I decided to give up some stones in the left corner for the capture of W's group at the lower side, I am not sure if this was correct.
JH : OK. I think 92 was not so good. White can fight directly with the stones on the right]
;W[cr];B[dq];W[ar]LB[bs:A]C[Horrible move !! Should be at A (B2)]
;B[jo]C[N97 : Good];W[kr];B[jr];W[ls]C[here I was running out of time]
;B[fl];W[js]
(;B[is]LB[ir:A]C[this is a bad mistake of mine, and still feel bad about it.
JH : Terrible mistake !! A is enough. You loose more than 20 points here]

;B[iq];W[hr];B[gp];W[el]LB[ch:a][rj:b]C[W116 : look small.
Big points : a, b];B[gr]LB[bj:a]C[117 : Not that big too. Imagine Black "a"]
;W[is]LB[fr:A]C[Play at A  is better locally];B[gs]C[Stupid move.]
;W[ks]
(;B[jc]LB[bj:A]C[I guess this was unreasonable, I felt a little desperate, because I was way behind after my blunder in the lower side.
JH : Very unreasonable. B10 looks big ?];W[id];B[ke];W[kd];B[jd]
;W[je];B[ie];W[jf];B[if];W[jg];B[ig]C[Black didn't accomplish  a lot here]
;W[jh];B[hd];W[hc]C[here I was confused, where to play first, I guess the lateral extensions are important, I thought about making more territory towards the center
JH : All this sequence is bad.
You should forget about center in big yose]
(;B[ek];W[ci]C[I didn't expect this answer, I think W played superior in the endgame.]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[em];W[rk]LB[rj:A]C[Should be at A];B[rj];W[qk]

A or B are bigger. C is bigger];W[ih];B[hh];W[hi];B[gh];W[be]
;B[ce];W[bf];B[cg]C[B16 is safer. It looks your sente anyway.]
;W[bg];B[bd];W[fr];B[bs]C[Here, B should have at least first played F1

(;B[ik];W[gk]C[Here, I felt in big trouble, because I could'nt choose what to give up. Now, I think F12  would be better to protect.
JH : F12 is clearly better];B[ej]C[I wanted to make my groups solid and prepare a cut at J11, although I guess I was just dreaming.]
;W[fh];B[gf];W[he];B[hf];W[ge];B[fg]C[I couldn't read out that F11 did not work here.]
