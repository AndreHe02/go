C[Hello!

Thanks for commenting my game :)

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt, 2d.  I'm not strong enough to know correct play; so even if I give variations please keep in mind that there may be better plays.  My goal when reviewing is to give ideas about how to think about the game.]
;B[pd]C[Tahiti [2k\]: salut
Tahiti [2k\]: cherry tree ?];W[dp]C[kaktus [3k\]: jep];B[qp]
;W[dc];B[de];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[cf]LB[ch:A][ci:B]
C[is this joseki neutral? or is there any advantage for b or w?

crux: It's not a joseki; Black's last move is much too narrow.  Needs to be at A or B instead.]
;W[oq]C[ok? other choices?

crux: Seems pretty natural.];B[kq]C[how about this? shouldnt it be k3?

crux: There are many possibilities, there's no way to talk about where it "should" be.  This particular move is a pincer that used to be quite popular.  K3 is probably not good since it would allow White a comfortable extension.]
;W[qq]
(;B[pp]C[crux: You can't really play here.  White gets solid territory in the corner, and Black gets poor shape.  See variation.]
;W[pq]TR[pp][qp]C[crux: Black's two stones are glued to White's strong ones.]
;B[no]LB[pn:A][qj:C][qk:B]C[crux: Even now, the black stones don't really work together in any coherent way.  There's a weak spot at A, and White could just play around B or C to split the side and make the black wall useless.]
;W[mp]C[crux: Very direct.]
(;B[ko]C[so far what is your impression?

crux: Black's stones are not working very well.];W[mo];B[nn]
;W[mn];B[pk];W[ip]C[crux: Again, very direct.  White certainly likes to fight.]
;B[ir];W[jq]
(;B[jr]C[crux: See variation for an attempt to resist more strongly.]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[jp];B[lq];W[lo];B[hp]C[crux: This doesn't look like a tesuji.  White can now capture the cutting stone easily and Black needs another move at the bottom to stabilize the group.]
;W[jn]
(;B[hq]TR[hp]LB[fq:A]C[crux: The marked stone is not important, so this move is too slow.  Maybe play at A instead.]
;W[fq];B[hn]C[b or w advantage`?

crux: Black is getting pushed around.];W[pn]C[good move by w i feel

crux: Right where it hurts.];B[oo];W[om]C[crux: White is playing very aggressively.  I'm not sure this is really needed.  White could be happy for the moment just to have spoiled Black's shape.]
;B[nm];W[ol];B[ml];W[ok];B[pj];W[oj];B[ph];W[oi];B[qh];W[kl]
;B[mj];W[kj];B[lk];W[kk];B[mh]C[crux: Now it's White's turn to get attacked.]
;W[nh]
(;B[lh]C[crux: Covers the weakness, but of the available moves, this has the least effect on the weak white stones.]
;W[ng]C[crux: Letting White out like this hurts.];B[nd]C[crux: Probably better to continue playing on the side of your weak group.]
;W[lf]C[again good move for w, right? any alternatives to this outcome?

crux: This move leaves behind a weakness - the knight's move can be cut.  Black could try to take advantage of this.]
;B[jh];W[jf]
(;B[ig];W[ld];B[hj]C[crux: Somewhat strange shape.];W[qc];B[qd]
;W[mf]LB[of:A]C[crux: White finally wakes up.  A move like A might be a better way to patch up, since it threatens a little bit more against the right side.]
;B[he];W[if];B[hf];W[hg]LB[kh:B][li:A]C[proper cut`?

crux: Interesting idea, trying to make use of the weakness at A and B.]
;B[hh];W[jg];B[ih];W[gg]LB[kg:A]C[crux: Probably best to play A now to defend against the sequence that occurs a bit later in the game.]

;B[sr];W[op];B[qr];W[pr];B[rs];W[rp]C[any better way to play for b?

crux: After getting cut, it was difficult.]
(;B[cn]LB[hl:A]C[crux: A instead takes care of all your weak points on that side of the board, but to win from here you probably do need to go all-out.]

crux: Maybe the hane?]
