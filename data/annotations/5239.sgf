C[My name is Sean and I am the reviewer of  the Game.
Please accept my apology for any spelling mistakes.

Both players are very aware of what a living structure is and what isn’t.  You both have a firm grasp of the basics.  Making a two eyed structure by individually placing stones however does not gain you much, only the single point of territory for each eye.  Try to place stones such that they are not immediately a safe structure but that when attacked can be quickly joined together to make one instead of starting by making a safe structure and then extending from it.  White does this at several points, they focus on creating a live group and allow black to surround and gain much influence.

Along that same line contact plays are not making full use of a stone’s potential and limit your ability to expand.  In this game it leads to a thickness in the stones of each player, and quite a few moves that help neither player. 

White’s opening is good, black’s was too defensive too soon.  Play your stones in such a way that it has somewhere it can escape to, but at the same time makes your opponent want to respond to it.  Initiative is very important and I know I mention it several times in the comments but you should think about how your move affects the initiative.  There are unnececary losses on both sides during the middle of the game and the end went much longer than it should have.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[np]C[A very defensive gote opening for black which hands control of the game to white.  All corners should have someone’s stone in it for influence before a move like this is made.]
;W[pd];B[dp]C[This is a good opening for white.  The gote move made by black earlier leaves white with the initiative.]

(;W[pj];B[co]C[Another very defensive move by black.  Also this move does not guarantee black the corner, which if it could not be entirely captured could be severely reduced.  This early in the game each player should try to make full use of each stones area of influence instead of building up defences.

Given Black's position in the corner white does not want to push too much because of the possibility of being cut off, but a few stones closer, or reducing on the bottom would be advisable.  See the examples in the branches]

(;W[dj];B[dk]C[Again black is not making full use of a stones influence.  When you play contact against a single stone like this you are at a disadvantage since you fill a liberty for both players but the opponent gets to fill in the next.

It is good that white did not respond to the contact move by black but i think that K4 would have been better since it infringes on Black territory where as K16 is neutral with modest white influence.]

(;W[jd];B[ek];W[ej];B[fk];W[cj];B[fj]C[White F12 would be a better response to this move, there is no chance a successful cut by black.]

(;W[ei];B[fi];W[eh];B[fh]C[Like blacks earlier move in the corner white's response to this move is an example of willingly giving up territory to the opponent to build a defence where there is no real threat of capture.

Even if white had played straight to the corner the result would have been better.]

(;W[dh];B[eg]C[Once again white is falling back unnececarily.]

(;W[ch];B[fg];W[ci];B[dg];W[bj];B[cg];W[bh];B[ck];W[ai];B[bg]
;W[aj]C[This move makes the structure completely safe, any more moves by white or black here are needless.]
;B[bk];W[ah];B[ag];W[ak]C[The run down the edge that starts here could have been prevented by black, see branch.]

;B[bq];W[aq];B[br];W[ar];B[cr];W[as]C[This was needless move.  It gives up the influence to black and allows him to control where the game goes next, much like the move black made earlier on.]
;B[oj];W[ok];B[nj];W[mj]C[This is a strange response to this but a good one.  Black has an unbreakable wall to the left White should try to push him back against it as much as possible to minimize the territory he gets from it.]

;B[ll];W[nm];B[ni];W[lm];B[km];W[om];B[ln]C[White's position is very strong at this point and white should feel safe enough to play elsewhere.  One example of this is shown in the branch where white would invade at H3]

(;W[pm];B[mn];W[ql];B[nn]C[White once again focuses on creating a living structure before stretching out in directly connected stones that do not use the full potential of each play.  Try to make moves that take up more space on the board, but that can if attacked be connected quickly.  See the alternate branch for an example of this that leads to a much larger influence for white.]

(;W[qm];B[on];W[rl];B[pn];W[rk];B[qn]C[Again the structure is strong and white should move on or at the least extend the position more efficiently.]

;W[rf];B[re];W[qd];B[rd];W[sf];B[rn];W[qe];B[rc];W[qc];B[pe]
;W[qb];B[rm];W[rb];B[sb]C[White does not need to respond to this move.  Black has no chance of living in the corner without taking the White group at R17.   White could instead, threaten black at P15 and then secure more territory at the top of the board.]

(;W[ra];B[sa];W[sc];B[sd];W[se];B[od];W[rd];B[pc];W[re];B[pb]
;W[oc];B[nc];W[ob];B[oa]C[White should follow the shicho once with a move at O18 more before capturing.   This would put black in a much weaker position.]

(;W[pa];B[nb];W[oe];B[na];W[nd];B[pf];W[ne];B[of];W[od];B[mc]
;W[nf];B[md];W[me];B[le];W[ng];B[mf];W[nh];B[mg];W[oh]C[By allowing white to make the move at P12, he is in a very bad position.  Whichever way he goes he loses stones.]
;B[mh];W[oi]C[This is a nice cut by White but Black could have prevented it easily.]
;B[sl];W[ph];B[sm];W[sk]C[This sort of fighting over a couple points as seen in the last few moves.  Should be done in the endgame, there are much bigger plays all over the board.]
;B[je]C[White's large group in the top right corner is single live group, it doesn't even have a serious ko threat, white should have immediately responded to this move with J16 or J15.  Either way he could then threaten the black group on the edge of the board, and expand his influence.

The example I show in the branch allows white to minimize the chance of being cut in two but still captures that group.]

;W[il]C[Black should have played at H7 next blocking the white group efficiently and quickly, see the branch for how.  Instead he allows white to run to the edge and create a living structure.  

Also when running like white does in this situation it is better to just a single space.]

(;W[ed]
(;B[pq]C[This capture by black was unnecessary the black structure was alive and these were dead stones anyways.  It would have been much better to respond to white in the corner.]
;W[fd];B[df];W[fc];B[cd]C[C17 woul d be a Better response to this stone.
It minimizes black's influence in the corner and is safer as well. 
The group right now doesn't even have a single eye but C17 would Guarantee at least one, and make it very hard for black to prevent a second.
As it stands white has to fight to stay alive.]

[rr][sr][cs][ds][es][ms][ns][os][ps][rs][ss]C[This move should have been the end of the game.  
There is no disputed territory, no ko threats left, and no area large enough to create a living structure.
Filling in points here as both players continue to do gains nothing in the long run.  With each stone you place and the other player reacts to, they lose 1 point for the stone they place, but gain 1 point for the stone that you placed and will be captured.  This balance is one of the key points in the game and takes a long time to learn.

If you score the game here the total is 75.5 white and 89 for black.
If each player would play a single stone in their own territory for each stone the other played in it the score would be the same at the end.  As it stands, both players played multiple points inside their own territory and white played several stones which ended up simply adding points to black’s total.   I pointed out the biggest set of moves that are an example of this but will not comment on the others.]
