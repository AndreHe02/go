C[Hi.

Generally speaking I have a mediocre opening, decent midgame where I've gotten the lead then made a mistake and lost it, and a poor yose.

I'm looking for some general things to remember that will help me get past these issues.

Thank you in advance for your review.];B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc]

(;B[qn]C[I think this was the wrong direction.

cant say is is wrong direction exactly .
Would just say  depending on player  style and preferance you can  choose acordingly
  
 even if this is inferior in top level it surelly cant cost you the game  :)]

I thought I had a plan to surround the middle stone like I would try to do as white in a 9-stone handi game.

 This is really a good move  for white  c13 actually a thank you move for him since he get the shimari and also attack your  c13  

 Attacking c10 almost imposible  its way too flexible at the moment and your c13 stone is very week among  black stones]
