C[C: for Comments
Q: for Questions
A: for Answers

Thank you very much for reviewing my game. Although, I won this game, but I just think that I still have a lot of bad moves. So I send this for review.

I played white, but I would like reviewers to give advises for both sides.

Moreover, I am very weak at invasion, and close combact, and I would like the reviewers show me more option in invasion and close combact.

Thanks again.];B[pd]C[Kokorini: Hi, I will make the review of this game trying to answer as better as can all of your questions.

I will start my comments like this:

K:

enjoy.];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[C: Now, I used a couple of time, thinking whether I should attack or play D10. Finally, I choose to attack at Q6.

Q: Is R6 better? But I am afraid black will pressue it at R8. Is so, how can I respond to that?

K: Well, first I think D10 is fine and Q6 too. It is a simple matther of personallity or how you wake up this mornning. D10 is cleary more deffensive and if you play at Q6 or R6 obviusly you are going to fight a little.

Now.. Between Q6 and R6, my personal choose should be Q6 becouse I like the idea of running away aimming to my own forces (left side).
And finally see var for your question.]
(;W[pn];B[qn];W[qm]C[C: By playing this, I predicted (B)R5, (W)P8 and getting the outward influences. But turn out black cut at Q7.

K: Lets see the secuence you say. (var)]
(;B[pm]C[Q: I just don't know how to respone to this kinds of cut.

K: I think you are in problems... I probably respond at R5]
;W[qo]C[K: like this... hehe~~];B[rn];W[po];B[ql];W[om];B[pl]
;W[op];B[qp]C[K: this is not good... black corner will fall.]
;W[ro];B[rm];W[rp];B[pg]C[k:Overconcentrated, black should play around one of white's corners]

(;W[pq]C[C: I played this, because I just to ensure that corner.

Q: Is black's two stones at the right lower corner dead?
Or just leave them alone, and get the point at D10?

K: I think it is a big fight... I prefer D10 becouse it is a biiig point and also K16. 

Maybe, if you analize the fight if black plays at P3 (without wQ3) a stone around K3 can be very usefull.. so.. if I was you... and I'm affraid of that I will play at K3 or maybe at L3 if I'm panic, go back a move and see the variant and imagine a white stone at L3.]
;B[cj]C[C: I feel bad about this move, because I should have played this before black did.

K: Yeah....];W[cg];B[cm];W[co];B[cc]C[C: At this moment, I decided to give black the corner, and get the outward influence.

Q: Am I right? or Still have to attack it to protect the corner?

K: You Can't kill Black invasion, you are right.];W[dc];B[db]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[fc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce];W[jd]C[K: I prefer L16 is better.]
;B[md]C[K: Now you have to invade 3-3... and black should be sad becouse he will have one super-secure territory and you will have a lot more.]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[jq]C[K: OK.];B[gq];W[eq];B[iq];W[ip]C[C: I think this is a bad move, but I cannot think of any other position.

Q: How can I respond to this correctly?

K: Well... playing at K4 is better. It is more solid and there is no need to give the posibillity to black of cut.]
;B[hp];W[io];B[ir]C[K: anyway... Black help you, this is very good for white.]
;W[jr];B[hr]C[K: Useless... Now you have to torture that group...Mmm...F2?]
;W[fr]C[Q: Is G6 better?

C: I played this because I just want to destroy the eye of those black stones.

K: F2.. hehe.. You did well, now black have to run way and you will make profit on the right.]
;B[go];W[fp];B[fn];W[hm]C[K: $$$];B[em];W[ol]C[K: A little slow... but $]
;B[ok];W[nk]C[K: You are forcing  black to make good shape, I dont like it. After this a reduction of black land will be hard.]
;B[nj];W[mk];B[li]C[K: and Harder.]
(;W[mj]C[K: Black should say: Thanks.
You are helping him to close the door for nothing, you can play at L9 now if you want.

Anyway... there is a better place to play... look around... N13 is much better.]
;B[mi];W[kk];B[jj];W[jk];B[ij];W[ik]C[K: no need.];B[hk]C[C: I am now jealous about the large territery of black's right upper corner, therefore I played L14 and try to invade into it.

Q: Am I played correctly, or having another great invasion skills?

K: I think is a little late for calling that invade... you are trying to reduce.
And I like L14];W[kf];B[cq]C[C: Originally, I feel quit confident to protect the corner. But.....

K: this CAN NOT live... play at 2-2 if you like it.];W[dq];B[cr]
C[K:B5]
(;W[dr];B[cp];W[bo];B[bp];W[ap]C[Q: Should I play B7 before playing this?

C: Black's shape was a dead shape, but I still cannot kill that, I feel very bad about that.]
;B[aq];W[br];B[ao];W[an];B[bn];W[ap]C[K: Black should play at D5 and there is no Ko]
;B[kr];W[lr]C[K: I think you can play K1];B[ao];W[am];B[al]
;W[ap];B[kq];W[kp];B[ao];W[lq]C[K: NO! you are giving up ALL the corner! And black cannot invade without connecting!]
;B[bm];W[ks];B[fq]C[K:??];W[mf]C[C: At this moment, I realised that I may lose this game (because previous defeat at the left lower corner), but I just don't want to give up to early. So I think invasion is my only chance to change the fate.]
;B[of];W[ne];B[od]C[C: After black's move, I was still finding places to attack, and finally I found the weakness at O11, so I did it.]
;W[ni];B[oj];W[nh];B[cf];W[df];B[ih];W[hf];B[jh];W[gh];B[gi]
;W[fi];B[fh];W[fg];B[eh];W[hi];B[gj];W[ei];B[dh];W[hh];B[fj]
;W[hj];B[tt]C[C: I think black has resigned too early.

Q: What is your overall opion about this game?
Which aspect you want me to improve?

Thank you very much.

K: Yes... indeed... the game score is near.

I think that you have to inprove a live and dead problems (me too) and the openning. I cand tell you about the ending but probably too.

Try to make more than one thing with your moves, like Attack and make territory (when you play at J4 and I tell you K4)

And try to see what is going to happend if I (my oppennet) make *this* here in about 100 moves, I mean.. Try play in future a little more.

Well... any question, feel free to tell me please.

Thx.
