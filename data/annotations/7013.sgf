Hello Tomasz Ślązok 1-Dan Poland here
I will try to help you if I can
[/review\]

Biondy [2k\]: have fun

Hi. Thank you for sparing some of your times to review this game.

I played black in this game. I think I did it ok in the opening, but in the middle game and yose, I was totally awkward.

I'm no good at this kind of close game (I usually fall in yose). I hope you can help me to improve, especially my yose skill.]

LB[bm:A]C[Should I played at A instead of this?

Theory said that A if you gave Q16 stone is better, but I play severy times I don't think your move is worse. In my opinion it is depend on style

What do you think?

[review\]
This is very good move, difference betwen this and K16 is very difficult to estimate. This move is very big because white approach from this site would be very huge
[/review\]];W[nc];B[pf]C[Is this too passive?
[review\]
no good it also help Q10 R6 stones
[/review\]];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[ld]C[[review\]
This is key position locally, but bacause white have strong position on bottom  it will be hard for you to get many point in center.

I think you should play E17

LB[mj:A]C[Maybe this is too slow. Should I create moyo with a move around A, or is there another better place on the board right now?

[review\]
White made mistake in direction with previous move. His group in bottom left corner is alive. He play very small move, which give you change to play biggest move on the board.

A is also big but, your move is bigger. 
[/review\]];W[hc]
(;B[eh]C[[review\]
Again white play slow move but this time you play meaningless move, white on left and top side is secure, you can't obtain any points from this move.

More shape is wrong white can play B13 - weak point

If you want to play in this area you should play one space jump.
Of course playing on left side is not top priority I would suggest to plat at R9
