AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Summary (more detailed comments in game)

I think black's main issue this game was failing to take sente to play bigger and more urgent moves.  Black often played small local moves when much bigger options were available - from the open all the way to the end game.

I think black should review his play and ask himself if he thinks white truly needs to respond to his moves.  If the move is not urgent for black or create a situation that white urgently needs to respond to, he should look around for bigger opportunities.  I think black could have made up the point difference in yose alone...]
;W[jd];B[nc];W[fc];B[fd]TR[dj]C[attaching tends to make your opponent stronger.  if your attempt is to make white over-concentrated, then I guess this move can be interesting, but my gut feeling is that this move is really more appropriate when you have a stones on the left, like at the triangle point.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[ec];B[ed];W[dc];B[cc];W[cb];B[bd]TR[ce]C[b16 doesn't protect the peep, so I don't think this gains over just connecting]
;W[qf];B[lc]C[this seems small.  if I were white I would consider not responding.  black gains almost nothing and white has much more valuable places on the board to play]

(;B[ie];W[ji];B[ig];W[kg];B[kf];W[ld];B[md]C[this strengthens white as much of more than it does black.  black is trying to run a group out and says "no, white, have a little bit more of a wall to block me with first".]
