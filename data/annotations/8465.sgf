Q : In this game, I gave up when I realised I couldn't defend goban's left side well and thinking of attacking right was a suicide.

Mark: Hi - I'm Mark Schlatter (mschlat on KGS and DGS).  I will be doing your review.  My general principle is to focus on the big issues and then handle tactical, smaller issues.  Please feel free to email me (mschlat@gmail.com) if you have questions or concerns.]

C[Q : Should I answer back down the Goban ?

Mark: Well, white's approach at A is not close to your 4-4 at B, so I don't think a direct response is called for.  However, I do see two problems with your move.

First, by playing in the exact middle, you have a thin connection next to a thin connection (both marked).  If I were to play in this area, I would rather make one connection thicker, so I would prefer to play at C or D.

Second, the big areas on the board before your play are the left and right hand sides.  I think the left is more important for you since you don't want white to take his secure 3-3 stone and take more territory.  So, overall, I think it is much more important to establish a presence on the left hand side.  The variation shows my preference.]
;W[nq];B[om]LB[qm:C][pn:A][qn:B]C[Mark: Not a typical response, but it could work.  It does emphasize the right hand side and center, but it's a loose connection on the fifth line.  I believe that fourth and third line responses are safer.]
;W[dj]
(;B[pi]LB[dg:A][dn:B]C[Mark: Now white has taken the big move on the left.  Note that you can still invade around A or B and run out to your groups.

I think your move is too passive.  You might take territory (although the connections are thin), but you don't have sente.  Consider the variation.]
;W[fc]
(;B[nf]LB[pe:A][qe:B]C[Mark: If you want to take the corner, A or B are better.  However, the big moves are still in the wide open spaces on the right hand side.  In general when you see extensions that wide (5 to 6 points), you want to think about invading or reducing at some point.  Here I think some move in these areas is bigger than your move.  See the variation for some options.]
;W[he];B[je]LB[kc:B][id:A]C[Mark: Here you have left a nice entry into the top (see variation).  The gap at A does not help you.  A play at B is a more solid move, but the left hand side is still more important.]
(;W[jg]
(;B[kg]LB[if:A]C[Mark: This move reinforces the right, but doesn't attack the left.  You can play at A, separate the white stones, and have more influence on the left.]
;W[ji];B[ll]SQ[je][nf][kg][om]C[Mark: You now have six stones on the fifth line or higher --- this means you are trying to emphasize the center over the sides or corner.  Your opponent has only three such moves.  Your priorities should be corners, sides, center.]
;W[jl];B[lo];W[lp];B[kp]C[Q : Is it good to cut here or going nearer the croner is better ?

Mark: As you see later in the sequence, this is not a cut.  Wedging between two stones can work, but rarely in the opening game.  You are still better off playing on the left hand side.  If white can secure the left with the wall in the middle, the game is over.]

;W[mi]LB[ki:D][mj:A][qj:C][qo:B]C[Q : How to counter this attack the best I can ?

Mark: There's a go proverb: defend from close up, attack from far away.  Your move at A simply serves to strenghten white.  You have several options.

1) Protect the right hand side by playing at B.  You threaten white and make sure your wall has territory as well. 

2) Protect the right hand side by playing at C.  It's a small move, but it does ensure that you keep the right hand side.

3) Separate the white stone by playing at D.]

;W[mm];B[ml]C[Mark: I don't think you need to focus on saving the stone at M8.  You know the large group at Q5 is already safe since you have killed the white group on the side.]

;B[er];W[dr];B[es];W[fr];B[gr];W[gs]C[Rem : I don't think continuing here worth it so I gave up.

Mark: Here's what I see as the big issues (in order of importance):

1) Even if you protect your groups better, you gave the game to white by not playing on the left hand side.  You need to fight in every large space, either by invading or reducing.  Since you never challenged white on the left, your gave your opponent the freedom to attack you on the right.

2) Focus less on putting stones on th fifth line or higher --- focus more on third and fourth line plays in the direction of open space.

3) Focus on moves that increase your liberties (and connect up stones) while decreasing white's liberties.  In particular, make sure you can kill cutting stones.  Reviewing the game in the upper right (especially around moves 101 and 123) will be particularly helpful.

4) You are making some unneccesary moves --- creating connections when you are already connected, creating eyes when a group is already alive.  I would suggest reviewing some basic life and death as well as connections.

5) Twice during the game, you make a "wedge" move --- placing a black stone between two opponents.  This can be a useful tactic, but only when you have some practice with it.  I would suggest using stronger moves (see my variations at 85).

I hope all of this helps.  As I mentioned before, if you have questions, please let me know.  I would be happy to expand on any of this.]
