C[In this game, white got into trouble by making too many weaks groups.
This gave black an easy game.
You seemed to be disappointed not to have kill one group : 
but it is not necessary to win the game.
Killing a group need that your opponent make several mistakes, or doesn't answer to several attack moves. So this is not happening very often, and you have to find another to get profit from attacks.
A better and easier way is simply to apply pressure on the weak groups to make territory.
In this game, you tried too much to kill the big white group without giving you the opportunities to have a second strategy : an estimation of the score in the middle game would normally show you that simply getting the last corner with C3 would have been enough to win easily this game with a 20 points lead.
In my opinion, The only reason this game came to a close end is C3.
My comments end at move 146.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed]

There's no need to create a 2nd group in this area.];B[lc];W[me]
;B[pg]LB[nf:C][of:A][og:B]C[I want to seperate two white groups.
This is a good idea. But here, you don't know yet which group you want to attack, so leaning with q13 doesn't seem a good idea : you are strenghtening white two stones without getting a direct result on the other 2 stones.
I would prefer simply to cut by playing at A , B or C.];W[ph]

(;B[pf]C[q14 is not a good idea. The shape move would be at P13.

(;B[pk]C[Is there better way to attack this right white group
Yes. Here you're attacking a single stone, wich is a kikashi stone (peeping stone). This is not a good idea, white will discard this stone. I guess simply threatening the group while making big yose points is enough. see var.]

It virtually kills any hopes for white to make eyes in the center.
Of course, white will probably get his eyes with q18. but this give you a better potential in the center, and allows you to enter at c3 whithout taking too much risks on j6 group status.]
;B[mb];W[nb];B[pb];W[ma];B[lb];W[gg];B[he];W[hi]C[white moves is too slow. better at g10.]

;B[hk];W[gi];B[ne]LB[hh:A]C[Black should simply play fisrt at c3.
white should simply play at A.];W[hj];B[gk];W[ik];B[jk]C[If this white group alive already, I should enter C3 instead.
Another idea is  : do i really need to kill this group  ? no.
So simply entering at c3 would have been enough.];W[dq]
(;B[ij]C[Instead of J10, does the variation can work?
yes, but the mistake is not to fail in killing the white group, but to let white close the last corner with d3.]
