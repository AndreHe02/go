AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

First of all some important points: always try to read at least one move in advance. To me it seems that on some occasions you don't do that and end up losing points. Try to read the sequences as far as you can and if they go wrong, then at least they go wrong because of misread and not laziness. Your reading improves and next time you might get it right. Another thing is you are a bit too eager to attack and play contact moves. Usually when you play contact moves (especially from weak positions!), you end up strengthening the opponent and creating bad aji in your own positions. Good attacking moves are usually from some distance. Only play contact moves later when you go for the kill. Moreover, as you yourself also noticed, you tend to leave too many weak points behind. Try to play strong shapes and not stretch as far as you possibly can. When you have strong shapes and strong groups you can mount effective attacks againts your opponent. If you look at the game again, you will notice that you were far ahead in the middle game, but lost many points as your opponent bit by bit ate your stones in the later part of the game.

Anyway, I enjoyed watching your game and there are many promising things there. I am not much stronger than you are, so do not take my word as the truth, but rather a suggestion and pointer for some alternatives. I hope it is useful.

My comments always begin with J:

Cheers,
Jaakko];W[pp];B[ed]C[Played high, to build influence.];W[cd]

(;B[ce]C[J: Attaching here is not good in my opinion. If you want to build influence, then D14 or D13 would be better. C17 is also one possibility here. See variations.]
;W[dd];B[de];W[ec];B[dc];W[cc];B[fc];W[eb];B[fd];W[fb];B[gb]
C[J: I think you should take care of the cutting point first, but I'm not sure if that is necessary. The result was quite OK for black, so that justifies not preventing the cut.]
;W[ee]
(;B[fe]C[J: This is not so good, i think. It only forces white to go where he would like to go anyway. Your left side is weak, so you should find a way to strengthen that instead of making it even weaker by forcing white to go there. Moreover, you create heavy shape of F16 stones and leave H2 for white. But... I don't really know if this is indeed the best move here. It seems not good at first glance, but then again without this the right side has weaknesses. Tricky.]
;W[ef];B[cg]C[J: Here you have to defend immediately after your attacking move just now, so it seems the direction was wrong.]
;W[ff]
(;B[gf]C[J: This is too eager. You end up creating a bad shape (which white exploited later in the game) and make weak stones. Attacking from distance is usually much better. Only play contact moves later.]
;W[eh]C[So far, I played to maintain influence in the upper side, while not being pushed too much down the left side.

Alternatively, I could have played the variation to build more influence.

J: Your move is OK, the variation would have been bad. See comments there.]

(;B[di]C[J: Good.];W[dh];B[ch];W[ei];B[dj];W[gg]C[J: Here you see the weakness of G14. Had it been H15, there would not be immediate need for defence. Now it happens that you gave white the opportunity to attack your stones and get a living group in sente.]
;B[fg]C[J: This is a potential disaster. Fortunately white did not notice it.]

(;W[fh];B[hg];W[gh];B[hf]C[J: Fortunately white did not notice your mistake, so the game looks good to you at this point. Although white lived in sente you got nice left side and upper side is also looking very big.]
;W[hh];B[jg];W[qf];B[nc]LB[nd:A]C[Played in response to the kakari, and to prepare territory in the top. I didn't want to have to overconcentrate if he went for a double approach.

Perhaps a high extention at A would have been better?

J: I think this is OK, although it seems a bit slow to me. Don't know what would be a 'proper' move here, though. I think A would have been better (to give better opportunity to attack R14 and also leave smaller gap to K13).]
;W[qi]
(;B[of]C[J: This is too slow. Does not completely secure the upper territory and does not attack the right side effectively either. See possible variation.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb]C[Still playing to secure territory in the top

J: This is very small. In exchange for a few points in the corner you let white get the whole right side. Not good exchange for black. You should have ignored S17 and tenuki, perhaps O3 or K3 or something like that.]
;W[qm];B[lq]C[J: This seems a bit odd to me. I would have probably played on K3 and plan for corner invasion later.]
;W[fq]C[J: Here you see the problem with M3. White did not need to do anything about it the lower right corner and you don't have a really good follow up move here. H3 leaves your corner and left side in danger, whereas securing the left side would force white to play something around K3 eventually, which would put M3 in a very difficult position. It can probably live without too much trouble, but the problem is that during that process, white could most likely secure a lot of territory on the right side and make his own F3 group strong.]

(;B[hq]C[J: This is perhaps too near to the white stone. J3 would have left you with a nice and almost secure group on the bottom, but now you need to worry about K3 weakness later.]
;W[fo];B[ho]
(;W[ep]C[J: Fortunately white lets you out easily.];B[do]C[J: This is good.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[dr]
(;B[fl]C[Played to prevend white from connecting the upper left and the lower left groups, and to support the groups in the bottom and on the left.


J: Both of white's groups are practically alive, so there's no point in trying to separate them. Also, this move does not do much to help either of your groups: Left side is still open for invasion and white can still effectively attack the lower group, since it is not yet completely secure. At this point I think you should have played something like G2 or C2 to attack the group AND make territory at the same time.]
;W[cr];B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[br];B[fn]LB[fl:54]C[I'm not sure attaching was the right decision here. It kinda ended up working against B54

J: This move is indeed not good. It does not secure you any territory and creates some painful weaknesses in your shape.]
;W[gn];B[go];W[en];B[fm];W[eo];B[hn]C[J: This move is not necessary. If white tries to get away, you can chase him and secure both of your groups at that time, or even sacrifice the 3 stones in the middle. You are leaving dangerous aji on the left side which could cost you dearly.]

(;W[dm]C[J: Luckily white was not so severe on you.];B[cm]C[J: Dangerous]

(;W[dl]C[J: Fortunately white did not punish you.];B[cl];W[dk]
;B[ck];W[ej]
(;B[ml]C[Played for general influence on all four sides

J: This stone is a bit oddly placed and does not feel right. It does not completely secure territory in the middle and does not attack any of the white stones. I feel reducing/invading white right side would be best. Can also first play P12 I think.]
;W[hd]C[And this is where I realize that my stones on the left weren't strong enough

I'm not sure how I should have handled this invasion though. I didn't want him to eat up my territory in the topwhile I strengthened the wall]

(;B[id];W[hc];B[gc];W[hb]
(;B[ga]C[Perhaps I should have just let him connect and played the variation instead.

J: I think my variation is better ;-)];W[ge];B[he];W[gd];B[ic]
;W[ha];B[ib];W[fa];B[oq]C[J: Somehow I feel this is not a good move, since it forces white to make a move he would like to make anyway. The result is, however, very good for black, so probably it's OK.]
;W[pq];B[oo];W[po];B[on]C[J: This result is very good for black. Leading by about 20-30 points even after the mistake on top.]
;W[mi];B[oh]C[J: I'm not sure what you want to accomplish with this move.]
;W[qh]C[J: White being overly cautious.];B[oi]C[J: White being overly cautious.]
;W[ji];B[ki]C[I'm not sure about this move. I wanted to cut, but in retrospective, it seems like an overplay

J: As I said earlier, you lead by a good amount of points, so playing this kid of moves is unnecessary. Instead, you could have played for instance L12, _threatening_ to cut the stone off and at the same time strengthen your territory, in sente.]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[ii];B[kh];W[jk];B[ij]C[J: Did you try to read this out before playing? If it was a misread, then it's OK, that happens. But if you gave white all those points without trying to see what is happening, then it is clear where you can improve your play. _Always_ try to read _at least_ one move forward. That way you will gain 2-3 stones immediately.]
;W[ik];B[hj];W[hk];B[gk]C[J: Not sure what are you trying to accomplish. Instead of this you should strengthen your positions that have been weakened by this white invasion. The game is still very much yours if you manage to hold on to the territory you have.]
;W[gj];B[hl]C[J: Another wasted stone.];W[jm];B[mh];W[lj];B[jo]
;W[ll];B[lm];W[km];B[mm];W[mk];B[kl]C[120-128 played to force him on the defence while I built my wall in the bottom

J: This is a wasted ko threat and does not achieve anything. White group is already very much alive, you don't win anything by feeding it more stones and thus giving white points for free. If you want to secure the territory more, then play at L6 or even L5. But that is too small for now. There are big points still to be played elsewhere. P2 being one of the biggest, I think.]
;W[lk];B[jl];W[il];B[im];W[hi];B[kn];W[kk];B[jn]C[J: This sequence earned you a few points but lost sente. Also, this last move is worth 2 points in gote. Hardly a move to be made at this stage.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[pe]C[xect [13k\]: No problem];B[oe];W[pk];B[ok]
C[J: This is a wasted stone. There's no territory to be made here and both groups are alive anyway.]
;W[pn];B[pl];W[pj]C[J: This is a rather horrible mistake by white. Should have played at R8 to prevent the invasion.]
;B[ql];W[oj];B[rl]C[I let him cut in order to get into his territory on the right

J: That is exactly what you should have done. These 3 stones are anyway connected to the bottom group, so there's no need to worry about them. If white want's to cut two living groups without making a single point of territory, then let him do so.]

;B[hs];W[fk];B[gl];W[el];B[em]C[J: Argh. There's no gain here, only loss. You cannot cut those 2 groups and even if white would let you do that, the gain would only be 1-2 points in gote.]

(;B[co];W[bm]
(;B[ap]C[I'm not sure why I wanted to connect here. It seems B8 would have been a better choice, to avoid the weakness presented by the three white stones

J: This is indeed a bad move. There's absolutely no need to connect now. You should have taken care of C10 weakness. Why not just calmly play C10? There's nothing white can do after that.]
