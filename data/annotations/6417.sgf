Hi,

I am TrueOrgan 5k on KGS and I will be trying to review your game.

Please remember that I am also very weak and you should take all my comments with a pinch of salt!

You may consider reading a little about shape. I reccomend the book "Shape Up!".

Hope you find my review helpful!

(;B[ec]C[pumading [12k\]: hi gg
pumading [12k\]: from germany];W[fc]C[TrueOrgan: In this situation I would not recommend E17 since this might help white settle.  If you do decide to make some kind of kick like this, you should be in a position where you already have a stone around c14 and can pincer immediately as in the variation.

Alcibaides [16k\]: America]
(;B[cf]C[TrueOrgan: The problem with this is the weakness at C17... (check variations)]

TrueOrgan:
I don't particularly like either of your methods, I explained why I don't like the first one earlier.]
;W[mb];B[ob]C[TrueOrgan: I don't like your position here since you need another stone around r14 to complete your corner.  Otherwise a move at Q15 or R14 can hurt a lot.]

TrueOrgan: Those are indeed better moves.  I think the most urgent move though, would be to help H3 by giving him a base. L3 is possible.]
;W[ep]
(;B[er]C[TrueOrgan: Running with this stone only helps white, you should rather atari from the outside and use the bad potential to gain more on the left side. (check variation)]
;W[fr];B[es];W[fs];B[cr];W[ds];B[cs];W[cn];B[ap];W[ip]C[TrueOrgan: This is why a base for the H3 stone is important, a pincer around L3 is even more dangerous for you.]
;B[cm]C[Stephen: I should have let this battle go shouldn’t I? I wanted to

TrueOrgan: Yes, these stones are not so important.  If you want to attack them, a looser move would be more appropriate, such as D9 or F6.]

TrueOrgan: I think you have to capture, it is definitely the biggest thing on the board.]

TrueOrgan: Yeah, this is a weird move. Connecting is better for sure.  The best I can see though, is S2 instead of Q2.
