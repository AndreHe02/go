C[Dan: I (8 kyu) played Black in this game against my opponent, who is also 8 kyu.  With Black winning by a mere 0.5 points, it's a very close game that I think is a good one for study.  Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions!]

LB[qe:A]C[R: I don't really like this move because it's influence orientated and D17 is low. It's probably not "wrong" but I would prefer A.]

(;B[oe]C[R: This one is strange. What's black's intention? I like to think of P15 as a move to build up influence or a moyo (if black has the upper left corner). Besides: In this situation a high position on the upper side is not desirable because WD17 is low.

R: If I was to pick a joseki I would like this typical one (see variation) most.]
;W[of];B[ne];W[pd];B[oc];W[nf]LB[qc:A]C[Dan: What is a good way to react to this move by White?

R.: This white move is bad (A is joseki). I would simply take the corner (as you suggested - see variation).]

(;B[me];W[ph]LB[qc:A]C[R: I think A is still bigger.];B[jd]
LB[qc:A]C[R: Still A instead. ;-)];W[gc]LB[qc:A]C[R: I like this one to "punish" black's high position. Besides: The upper right corner is still huge. ;-)]

(;B[ce]C[R: Maybe its better to simply split the left side and make a base there (see variation).]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ci]
(;B[ch]C[Dan: Is this correct?

R: I don't like it but since black's situation is cramped (compare easy splitting variation at move 21) it may be the best choice. I did try some variations but wasn't happy with them either.]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[di]C[R: This result is very painful for black (espacially compared to the splitting move).]

(;B[qn]LB[ge:B][ff:A]C[R: I think black should help his weak group first. A is safe. B is faster but weaker. At the moment white cannot cut B because he's too weak himself.]
;W[nq];B[pq];W[kq];B[qc];W[bd];B[qk]LB[ff:A]C[Dan: Again, I left the stones in the upper right because I wasn't sure how to play them.  Can you give me some suggestions?

R: I would jump out. After white B16 there is even less to gain at the side.]
