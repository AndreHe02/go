C[Issue #1 - I am trying to learn to
comment/review my own games, so
criticism of my attempts aand ommissions
is appreciated.  Issues #2 and #3 -
professionals and strong amateur players
say my big weaknesses are middle-game
fighting and taking a big point when an
urgent point exists.  Comments on these
issues would be appreciated.

I am White.

Hint:
To learn to comment your own games, please comment each and every move. Express the benefit of the move in one sentence. Start with move 5 onwards.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[co];W[op]C[P4: if you view this as being a potential moyo game then the 4th line move is okay; otherwise please play a 3rd line move in the opponents zone because it is better for base making.]
;B[oq]C[P3: of course this is a style, but it is better to try to use the shimari by pincering W6?]
;W[nq]C[O3 is okay, of course, but consider Q4, nadare when you have two star stones. Hey, its fun! And your 4th line move means moyo is better than cast, agree?]
;B[pq];W[mp];B[qn];W[iq];B[jc]C[B13: big. G3 is possible too because it is a double whammy move and makes the bottom W posotion weaker.]
;W[fq]C[Are the left or right sides bigger?

After F3, the left side is bigger than the right side. Here is why.

There's 10 lines between the 3rd and 4th lines stones on the left; there's only 9 on the right. Further, the existence of R6, "the knife stone", make the left side less interesting and a bit played out (or finished).]

(;B[mc]C[B15: this is both slow and not urgent. If Black must play on the top, O17 is better. Normally three spaces is weak, but in this special case, Black can easily handle the weakness tactically; therefore Black is light.

I believe that C14 would be the largest public area.];W[oc]
C[P17: prepares to squeeze the two black stones and is valuable in its own right. So, good move.]
;B[fc]
(;W[df]C[Would W-F16, B-G16, W-E17 been a better
choice?

Only if you are willing to give up H17 potential; so the answer is no.]
;B[db]C[Here White should immediately consider the fighting move of H17, especially since D14 is a 4th line stone which will help in the ensuring battle; however...]
;W[cc];B[hd]C[ Now N17's slowness is even more evident. So White is good enough to make an ideal position on the left.]
;W[cj];B[cl];W[ej]C[This looks nice but is too early. E10 has almost no offensive value against the strong black stone on the lower left and it is not an exact defense of the upper left either. Since White can handle a black invasion on the left, White should take the last big point at R13 instead.]
;B[qf];W[qe]C[W26: why touch it? Just R16 is enough.];B[pf]
;W[nb]C[Maybe S15 is better direction?

O18 seems like gote endgame. Usually move the inside stones out. So, O15? This situation is the fault of E10.]
;B[pj]C[B29: Black got an ideal position on the right.];W[rf]
;B[rg];W[re];B[lq]C[M3: too early? Omitting R12 leaves an incomplete position.]
;W[lp]C[N2 is joseki

Yes, unless the center is really important you gave up something here. Beter to attack M3 with N2; you will both come ou and the Black right will become weakened as your benefit.]
;B[kq];W[kp];B[jq];W[jp];B[ir];W[ip];B[hr]
(;W[mr]C[N2: How about an asking move at C3 first (instead)? Maybe you make some mischief?]
;B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[hp];B[fr];W[fp]C[F4: saves an unimportant stone?]

Sorry, but Black is ahead because it is not easy to make a lot of use of the white wall. Also white lost ground with E10 and O18 (slow).]
V[37.8];B[en]C[B51: not a great reduction. Black can simple play at K9 and White is severely reduced.]
;W[fn];B[em];W[fm];B[no];W[np];B[on];W[po]C[Consider r12 instead? Time to punish?]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[nm]C[B63: this fight is not faorable for Black; INstead he can give up 2 stones and build up his own moyo by going from P8.]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[ok];B[nk];W[qm]C[just P10 better?

Yes.];B[pl]C[Wow];W[pk];B[ql];W[qk];B[rl];W[rk];B[rm]C[This is awful for Black.]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[ph]C[Q12: normal is P11 just come out; if you play Q12 it means you read it out.]
;B[pg];W[qh]C[Must P12, keeping inside stones outside and keeping pressure on the very heavy center black group while helping your own heavy stones.]
;B[oi]C[All of a sudden White has shortage of liberties.];W[pi]
C[Shape looks difficult.];B[oh]C[Now White needs S12 so this exposes why neglecting P12 was a mistake before. Black got a lot on the outside while White got a small gain for a lot of stones on the inside.]
