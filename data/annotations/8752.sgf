C[da9304 [7k\]: Hi !
da9304 [7k\]: have a nice game

[Reviewer's comments\]
[Agi\] Hi, I'll be reviewing this game and will tag my comments accordingly. This game is a fighting game, and I will be covering general lines of play without being picky with the details. The moves presented won't be ideal, but illustrate concepts to think about.]
;B[pp]C[foxtrotzou [6k\]: slt];W[pd]C[da9304 [7k\]: ah, oui, salut :D
foxtrotzou [6k\]: bp];B[dq];W[dd];B[co];W[qn];B[jq]LB[nq:A]
C[da9304 [7k\]: Is this move more important than an direct answer to white R6 ?

[Agi\] There's nothing inherently bad about K3 and is a playable position. It makes white entering around A more difficult.]
;W[nq];B[oo];W[lq]C[[Agi\] Already white's feeling tight because she can't extend as much as she wants.]
;B[jo];W[no]LB[mn:A][mo:B][jr:D][pr:C]C[[Agi\] O5 is not a very good move for white. If she wants to run, A or B would do a better job of it. C and D would be an attempt to live in a tight space (which is very not good for white since black gets a huge outside)]
(;B[np]LB[nn:A]C[[Agi\] Playing O4 means you're looking to cut white somehow. See variations.]
(;W[mp]
(;B[nn]LB[mp:B][np:A]C[[Agi\] exchanging A for B to make this move is counter productive. You let white take a stone and weaken your black group.]
;W[op]LB[pq:A]TR[on][po]C[[Agi\] With this, white's group is very close to being alive, and now black is just 3 lonely stones]
;B[pn];W[qo]
(;B[qm]C[[Agi\] Letting white connect all his stones is a bad idea. See variation]
;W[po]C[[Agi\] Now that white has connected, he can turn his attention onto attacking black's group, or moving to any of the large points on the board]
;B[on];W[qp]LB[pq:A]C[[Agi\] White should catch the stone securely at A instead... if black extends...]
(;B[pj];W[mn]LB[jd:D][qh:A][cj:C][ql:B]C[[Agi\] This move seems a bit small. Playing at something near A (aiming to use the clamp at B) or something large like C or D would probably be better.]
;B[qf]C[[Agi\] Black's comfortable on the right side now.];W[nl]
C[[Agi\] Again, slow and aiming to catch 4 stones. White needs to look at the whole board.]
;B[pl]LB[nc:A][nd:B][pm:C]C[[Agi\] The double kakari at A or B would be worth more than giving up the stones around C. R14 and Q10 can live on their own without C]
;W[nd];B[of];W[nm]C[[Agi\] White is obsessed with these 4 stones.]
;B[rd]LB[cf:B][cj:A]C[[Agi\] The right side is overconcentrated. A black stone at A or B is worth so much more than this slide.]
;W[ol]C[[Agi\] White still obsessed.]
(;B[cf]TR[nd][pd]SQ[fc]C[da9304 [7k\]: I was ready to sacrifice thos stones, that I thought they were not that important (Did white waste his time while trying to capture it ?)
da9304 [7k\]: Is black F17 better than C14, considering white..."weak stones" at the upper right corner ?

[Agi\] O16/Q16 aren't that weak just yet. See variation];W[pm]
LB[rd:B][cf:A]C[[Agi\] White has wasted 4 moves, and given up both A and B to capture 4 stones. Let her choke on them.]
(;B[ql]C[[Agi\] Black should let white just take these. see variation]
;W[fd];B[bd]C[[Agi\] This is the wrong direction. The left is worth much more to black than the corner.]
;W[cj]C[[Agi\] White invades.]
(;B[dk]C[[Agi\] This is trying too hard to take territory on the bottom. See variations]
;W[cc]
(;B[ck]C[[Agi\] With C17, black lost the option to live in the corner. C9 is hurting those stones now.]
;W[dj]
(;B[eg]LB[cf:A][eg:B][ej:C]C[[Agi\] Weak group running with a knight's move. This is asking to be cut.

Black really wants to play C, but is having trouble because he has a weak group]
;W[ce];B[cg]C[[Agi\] This is an awkward move that was needed because e14 was in a weird place.]
;W[fj]C[[Agi\] Now black is the one under attack. White's invation has been a huge success.]
;B[ej]LB[ei:A]C[[Agi\] Again, black is hurting his own group with this move. White already wants a stone at A, black is giving her the perfect excuse to put a stone there. In sente.]
;W[ei];B[ek];W[dh]C[[Agi\] More pain.];B[be];W[dg]C[[Agi\] White is trying to cut black and get to safety. It doesn't work. see variation]
(;B[ee]C[[Agi\] This doesn't work. it's already cut.];W[df]
;B[de];W[cd];B[ed];W[ec];B[bc];W[ef]LB[dh:A]C[[Agi\] sacrificing these stones for life in the corner is a big loss for black. If black lived, white's group at A would still be weak enough to attack (which lets him destroy territory at the top]
;B[cb];W[fe];B[lc];W[jc]LB[qc:B][le:A]C[[Agi\] White would really want to play something at A instead and try to kill black., but because there's no easy life in the corner, white can't.]
;B[le];W[mc];B[ld];W[qc]
(;B[oc]LB[rc:B][nf:A]C[[Agi\] Black is in a rush to kill white. but A and B give white options.]

(;W[oa]C[[Agi\] This is a mistake by white here];B[qa];W[sa]
;B[qa];W[je]TR[ic]C[[Agi\] White is desperate and trying to kill black]
;B[ic]LB[jb:B][mf:A][lg:C]C[da9304 [7k\]: I think it's a big mistake, considering the flow of the game, isn't it ?

[Agi\] If black lives, white is dead in the corner and the game is over. Much more simpler moves like A, Bor C would get the job done without complications.]
;W[ma];B[lb];W[md];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg]LB[fj:A];W[jb];B[kf]LB[fj:A]
C[[Agi\] The ladder doesn't work.]
(;W[hq]LB[lf:A]C[[Agi\] For huge ladders like this. Spending the extra move to capture A is worth exploring. see variation]
(;B[ho]TR[mn][no][mp][lq]C[[Agi\] Before you make this move you have to read out whether the double peep is workable.]

[Agi\] Final comments:
In this game, we saw many instances where black weakened his own stones by forcing white to play somewhere. If we're playing in an area and we have stones on both sides, we usually want to play FROM the weaker side, to add stones there to make them stronger.

White spent too much time early on chasing the 4 stones on the lower right, and that gave black a huge lead all over the board. Unfortunately, black couldn't hold onto the lead and died at the top.]

;W[ho];B[jm]TR[jg][ji][jk]C[[Agi\] It also makes a very strong group for black to run to.]
