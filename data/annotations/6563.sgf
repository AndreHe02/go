C[hi! in this game i played black. please, if i missed something in the game that really is important for my improvement then please tell me :) I would like yo to tell me what kind of go books should i read (Tesuji, Life & Death,...) too, if u can. By the way, i think i made some moves that wasn't really necessarely. Can u point me those?

Thx, and sorry - my english is horrible T___T

* Hi Daniel, my comments start with a *.

I think you played a good game (and in the end you won as well).
I think there were 2 weak points in your game: 
- how you handled the invasion of white in your moyo - a few times you played moves that helped white to expand his territory more then yours (e.g. 39 and 71).

Books to recommend are always difficult, there are 2 books that come to my mind:
The direction of play 
The Art of Positional Judgement

Apart from these books with Tesuji-problems are always good to read and study.


Hope this all help.
If you have any more questions I am quatarbol on KGS you can call me there (although I am not often online).]

* There are 2 problems with this move:
1. white will always answer on A, this move expands white moyo more then black will make territory.
2. move is on the 4th line but white will the first one to be able left of this destroying the potential points black had.]

Normally you should try to prevent clamping to a weak stone because with will strenghten the stone.
Also if you think it is not possible to kill white, make yourself as much territory as possible and let white live small.

Yout decision should depend on the score on the board as well.
White has:
right side: app. 55 points, 
bottom: 5 
So in total around 60 points.

Black has bottom: 8 points
left bottom: 15 points
Top right: app. 20 points.
In total 43 points.
Black has to get over 20 points to win.];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc];B[fd]

A. will cut the white group
B.  Will prevent eye-shape for whit so white will have to connect. Then black C 

Another problem of this move is that white gets more points by answering then black get by playing here.
If you want to prevent white from expanding play around D, if white answers on the right, play E to link up and expand your moyo.]
