variation shows the most common response.]

;B[dn];W[fr];B[fp];W[gq];B[er]C[this doesn't work, how to continue if white simply connects g2?]
;W[dr]
(;B[ep]C[I chose to connect my 2 groups instead of play G2

i think g2 would be better (variation)];W[es];B[do]C[i don't like this shape too much. g4 looks important. pushing white along the third line is ok here, black has lots of potential for a moyo.]
;W[cp];B[lq]C[?];W[jq];B[gp];W[hq];B[op];W[ci];B[ck]C[is C14/C15 better? 

neither put enough pressure on c11. c13 can't be played because the black shape at c6 isn't strong enough. but c9 is overconcentrated, another solution must be found. i would recommend trying d10 or e11, but it's a difficult shape, i'm not very sure.]
;W[cf];B[bd];W[cd];B[cc];W[be];B[dd];W[ce];B[oc]C[what about L17?

that or l16 would be a good idea. playing p17 makes a play along the right very big, which is not attractive to white because he hasn't finished the shape at the bottom, and he would also like to invade the top. so p17 also looks good. black is doing well at this point.]
;W[jc];B[hc];W[mc];B[he]C[here i think black should either take the big point somewhere along the middle of the right side, or play r5. h15 appears to be played to prevent the invasion at f17, but it's not a severe invasion, probably taking away 10 points, but giving black strength towards the center, not worth giving sente for.]
;W[ef];B[po]C[i think r5 is more severe, but this is ok if followed up with a hane.]
;W[qo];B[pn]C[i really think this should be at r6. a fight is can not be avoided here. black is becoming overconcentrated again, and white is comfortable on the third line.]
;W[qj];B[qn]C[white was mistaken not to go on pushing, now black gets a good point.]

;W[rr];B[so];W[mr];B[mq];W[nr]C[does M2 work?

yes it does, there's a net if white tries to cut at n4 (variation)]
(;B[nq];W[lr]
(;B[pk]C[this is a difficult moment, black has to find a way to use the thickness. this looks a bit cramped. one suggestion might be to target the k17 group, which looks weakest, by leaning on the r10 group (variation)]
;W[pj]
(;B[qk]C[this is overconcentrated shape, it only defends a couple of points. you need a plan what to do with the thickness (never easy). the next logical move after starting the shoulder hit is p10 (one possible variation shown)]

;W[pe];B[rd]C[in this case, s17 would be more advantageous way to connect]

;W[je];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[ni]C[N10 is good, but then white can invade my territory and N10 seems useless...

the shape from not continuing here ended up being very bad. please note that black can cut at k4, so things are not as bad as that.]

C[i believe white is only very slightly ahead, a good endgame can still turn things round for black. this doesn't look like the biggest move at this point. maybe a16 or l13 or o18?]

no more comments after this one. i hope i managed to show a few points of interest. the game became difficult to comment quite early on because of the unusual fuseki. the use of strength and avoiding over-concentration seem to be the biggest issues in black's play, at least in this game.]

(;B[gr];W[es];B[hq]C[now if white comes out at e5, black can simply extend along the left, because the bottom is strong. the ladder breaker is not the ideal approach move to the top right, and the solitary stone at p2 has become less attractive for white to attack.]

(;B[op]C[now if white continues peacefully on the right side, black can extend along the bottom. if white seeks complications he might pincer the two stones, and black could wrap around the corner and become strong on the outside.]
