US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[8];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[fp]C[jloup: I had decided to play agressively but take some 'cash' (safe territory) first,

that's why I played f4 then e3. But it did not work out well because black made
a large lower side.

PG : I would prefer D6 for White but...];B[gp]L[fo][eq]C[PG : Most likely, it is a matter of taste rather than anything else but I don't like playing at 'b': it is too inflexible which may turn out to be liability this early in the fuseki.

White does get secure territory but the thickness Black gets in return on the bottom works well with the black stone in the lower right corner.
If White must build thickness immediately, playing at 'a' seems preferable.

Still, it cannot be said that White 'b' is a mistake since the balance of territory and influence is maintained over the board.]

(;W[eq]N[Actual game];B[fo];W[ep];B[gq]L[dn][go]C[PG : Either 'a' or 'b' are possible. 'b' would be consistent with White's intention of playing aggressively. The line given in variation B is joseki.]

(;W[dn]L[go]C[jloup: I had planned to cut at 'a' as soon as possible but didn't manage to do it.]
N[Actual game];AB[fc]L[jq][cj][kq]C[PG : A black stone at 'a' and a white stone at 'b' would complete the joseki in the lower left. After the black tenuki, White could play 'c' and start a fight with good prospects.


Black's move is not without merit: if White had been allowed to play a stone at 'b', a white pincer would then severely restrain the black stone at F17.]

(;W[id]N[Actual game]C[PG : I am fond of this move myself but would be hard put to justify it: pincers are usually made when an extension has allready been played on the other side. There is no need for White to fear Black claiming the upperside: the Black position will be thin and open to invasion if necessary.

Now, if Black simply jumps in the corner, and White follows the usual joseki (as happened in the game), Black will retain sente.

On the other hand, if White simply extends down the side, Black ends up having played on two sides and White only on one: White may be falling behind in the overall balance of influence.

Variation B is a common alternative.];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[ec];B[bg]L[cf][fd][ce]C[jloup: the joseki is at 'a', b13 does not look good. what's the best way for W to take
advantage of this?


PG : Black 'a' and White 'b' are indeed the usual continuation; Black then has sente to play elsewhere.

Black B13 is a mistake: it is too low and has little potential for growth. White can probably tenuki and refrain from defending at 'b' ('b' remains an excellent move none the less, fixing White's shape).

Playing at 'c' as in the game may be aji keshi. White could keep a sequence as shown in variation B in reserve for later.]

(;W[ce]N[Actual game];B[be]
(;W[qn]L[nc][kq][kp][qj]C[PG : 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' are also possible. Approaching the corner from the open side is correct. Variation B is an interesting continuation that could mix things up.]
;B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[fd]L[qj][lq]C[PG : A sound move but inconsistent. White should extend to 'a' before Black plays in that area. White can later aim at 'b'.]

(;B[lc]L[qk]C[PG : As mentionned in the previous comment, Black should attack by playing a move somewhere around 'a'. If White then approaches the upper right corner at 'b', variation B is a nice continuation. The white position at the top will still be open to invasion.


As it is, M17 is a move which should have induced F16; the opposite happened here.]
;W[qf]L[qj][qk][qc]C[PG : This could be an overplay and Black should answer by pincering since there is allready a black stone at M17. R14 would be better at 'a' or 'b'. Unless, Black defends immediately which is unlikely, White can always jump in at 'c' later in the game.]
N[Actual game];B[qe]L[nc]C[PG : A pincer is theoritacally appropriate since this move only strengthens White and hardly protects the corner. After this move, Black still needs to add a stone at the top around 'a': in other words, an immediate attack could backfire on Black.]
;W[pf]L[qh][pj]C[PG: If White is worried about being pincered, playing 'a' and then 'b' may be feasible instead.]
;B[qh]M[qn][rp]L[qk][qj][qi][ql]C[jloup: at this point I did not like my position.


PG : It seems like it is not too late to get the right idea but R12 is too close to the white stones to be effective. I would prefer attacking the marked stones first since White can answer R12 at 'a' or 'b' and get good shape. Extending to 'c' on the other hand, after Black 'a' or 'd' would give White an overconcentrated position.]

(;W[od]L[qj][qk][qc][nc]N[Actual game]C[PG : This feels wrong and I would say it is aji keshi. White should leave the top alone for now and concentrate on the right side by playing at 'a' or 'b'. Both the white and black marked stones should be able to get out safely to the center. White could then use his stones to support an invasion of the top.

The sequence that was played kills the aji at 'c' and 'd'. White has forced Black to take territory...]
;B[oc];W[pe];B[qd];W[nd];B[nc];W[qj];B[oh];W[ng]L[nf]C[PG : 'a' is good shape and serves the same purpose. Playing too close to Black will strenghten him and allow him to turn on R10.]

(;B[ri]L[rj]C[PG : Prevents White from connecting underneath. 'a' may also be possible (variations B and C).]
;W[rj]N[Actual game];B[rg]L[rf]C[PG : Not a good move. It does not secure an eye for Black and by inviting White to descend to 'a', Black weakens his corner territory.]
;W[rf];B[pj]L[ni][ql]C[PG : I would prefer 'a' to leave the possibility of an invasion at 'b' open.]
;W[qi]L[pk]C[jloup: w r11 turned out to be a bad mistake, causing shortage of liberties.


PG : I guess White is trying to kill which may be unreasonnable. Simply playing 'a' is enough. If Black can be chased far enough in the center, along with the white stones that separate him from the top, White will be in a good position to invade the bottom.]
;B[pi];W[pk];B[ok];W[pl];B[ol];W[pm]M[pf][qf][rf][pe][od][nd][ng]L[qk]
C[jloup: it is painful to push once more, but this was needed to protect the cut at 'a'.


PG : Indeed, these submissive moves are a consequence of the R11-Q11 exchange. Black is now thick and can turn his attention to the marked stones.]
;B[nn]L[md][me][le][mf]C[jloup: the result is disastrous for w. question for the reviewer: how should w have played
to avoid this?


PG : It migth be better for black to start with 'a' possibly followed by white 'b', black 'c' and white 'd' before playing at O6.]
;W[md];B[ld]L[kb][fb][ib]C[PG : 'a' seems possible here aiming later at 'b' and 'c'. By letting White separate his stones, Black has lost some of his advantage in this fight.]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[lb];B[nb];W[kb];B[me]L[lf]C[PG : This is bad shape and aji-keshi. Black should simply extend to 'a'. Anyways, his prospects have become grim.]
;W[nf];B[lf];W[ke];B[ne];W[oe];B[le];W[mh]L[kh]C[PG : I looked at 'a' instead but could not come up with any variation where White captures Black: the two white stones at the top are too weak.]
;B[kf];W[kh]C[PG : I like this move, it feels right.];B[je];W[jg];B[ie]
;W[kc];B[jd];W[ic];B[jc];W[jb];B[hd];W[hc];B[gd];W[gc]L[he]C[PG : Patient, but cutting at 'a' would not work anyways.]
;B[fe]
(;W[fb]L[he]C[PG : Black F15 is an overplay: cutting at 'a' now seems possible. See variations B and C.]
;B[hf];W[kd];B[jf];W[hh];B[ig];W[ih];B[kg]L[ji]C[PG : Unnecessary and aji-keshi: Black is reducing his own liberties and has deprived himself of an eventual peep at 'a'.]
;W[jh];B[hg];W[ge];B[he]C[PG : I considered giving up the two stones to get out faster but it turns out that attacking G15 facilitates Black's escape.]

(;W[gf]L[ff]C[PG : White at 'a' instead is interesting. See the variations below. Unfortunately it does not work.In any case, White gets very little out of pulling this stone out. Playing elsewhere seems preferable since 'a' could later be considered again after the left is played out. If Black decides to makehis second eye right away, White can think of it as playing two moves in a row.]
;B[gg];W[ff];B[fg];W[ef];B[dh];W[nj];B[oj];W[ml]L[nm][ln]C[jloup: I felt better at this point but still had the impression of being behind.
I expected B to connect at a and intended to follow at b.


PG : These moves seem ok. Black's thickness is going to waiste and White is solidifying his own position as he builds up a moyo in the center.]
;B[kp];W[om];B[nh];W[mg];B[ni]L[pg][mj]C[jloup: W would resist more strongly with variation B but black can still win.]

(;W[pg]L[mi][mj]C[jloup: this was bad since B cannot live locally anyway.


PG : Therefore playing at 'a' or maybe 'b' (but then White gets cut to pieces) would allow White to strengthen his position and to keep Black from expanding his moyo into the center. (See variation B.)]
N[Actual game];B[nk];W[mj];B[mk];W[nm]C[PG : Painful but necessary to prevent Black's territory at the bottom to swell.]
;B[mi];W[li];B[lj];W[dj]M[hh][ih][jh][jg][kh][li][mh][mg][nf][ng][pg][pf]
[pe][oe][od][nd][md][mc][qf][rf]L[fi][fj][fk][fl]C[jloup: this was played to invite a fight because I felt I would lose otherwise.


PG : Indeed, the situation is starting to look hopeless. Black should now move out to the center with 'a' or 'b' putting pressure on the marked white stones. If Black can then push again in sente to 'c' od 'd', he will be in an excellent position to attack the white stone at D10.]
;B[bk]C[PG : This is simply wrong: at the very best, Black his helping White build a vas moyo in the center; a more likely scenario, is the actual course of the game, where White gets thickness to attack the Black stones in the center.]
;W[ci];B[ch];W[bi];B[cl]L[fi][fj]C[PG : it is not too late to get back on track: Black can still play 'a' or 'b'. Locally, Black should treat B9 lightly and move further out to D8.]
;W[dl]L[el]C[PG : 'a' is better for White as there is no need to play close to the black stones.]
;B[cm];W[ck]L[cn]C[PG : this side offers little potential for Black, White should play at 'a'.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[co];W[cp];B[dm];W[em];B[el];W[ek]C[jloup: simply connecting seemed hopeless so I invited more trouble.]

[lf][lc][ld][le][me][ne]C[jloup: I was finally relieved at this point, having got thickness to attack the
marked group, in exchange for the side.];B[do];W[eh]C[PG : Black is in a tight spot but I think he can pull out his stones by following variation B.]
