C[taresan: Hi!];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[eq];W[eo]C[this is a tricky opening,so my follow up may be wrong

;W[jp];B[cr]C[after i sealed in i have to defend in gote

[kb\]: Your play at B4 is suspect.];W[pn]
(;B[np]TR[ip][jp][jq]C[These stones are stronger than they look - it is probably better to play low or pincer here.]
;W[nn]C[another tricky opening

[kb\]: In this context it looks OK, especially since it helps White connect all his stones together.]
;B[lo];W[mo];B[mp];W[ln];B[lq];W[ko]TR[ln][lo]C[[kb\]: This exchange is not good for Black.]
;B[ce];W[cg]LB[ed:A]C[the pincer look too brave for me

[kb\]: Agreed, but your response is incorrect.  "Make a fire in the east to attack in the west"]

(;B[dg]C[[kb\]: This move is really suspect.  It hurts the heavy C10 stones at the left.]
;W[dh];B[df]
(;W[ci]C[[kb\]: This move is joseki, but probably a better response here would be the stand at E12.]
;B[fc]C[i not sure about this move

[kb\]: I am not familiar with this joseki much either, but it seems too risky.  Still, Black could get an acceptable result.]

(;W[ed]C[[kb\]: White let you off the hook.];B[hd];W[fd];B[gc]
;W[cd];B[be];W[ff];B[fg]C[now i got 2 groups to settled while white 1, so i think i am in trouble.]
;W[he];B[id];W[dj];B[eh]
(;W[gf]C[[kb\]: Solid, but too soft.  White can give up the H15 stone.]
;B[ei];W[bj];B[ck];W[di];B[ek]C[lucky? i get to connect both of my groups

[kb\]: Yes.  But White can still push up at E10 to create weaknesses.]

(;W[bh];B[ej]C[[kb\]: Black is ahead in this game now.  White has little to do with his influence.]
;W[nd];B[lc];W[pf]
(;B[qd]C[[kb\]: This is really a direction of play issue.  You must try and reduce the center of the board.]
;W[oe]C[very solid move, now white influence toward centre is very good.]
;B[qi]C[i think this is wrong? since i still got 1 unsettled group on the left.

[kb\]: This move looks good.  It looks hard to kill the group on the left - it is too big.]
;W[qg];B[ql];W[qm];B[pl];W[rm]C[[kb\]: Good double attack by White.]
;B[om];W[on];B[rl];W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[pq]
(;W[qr]C[for me this is a very greedy move

[kb\]: It is the right direction - but must be at S2];B[ro]
;W[rq];B[qn];W[pm];B[so]C[mistake, should be at s6

[kb\]: no, S6 runs into the same problem.];W[sl];B[sk];W[sm]
;B[pr];W[rk]C[This is bad for White.  Now he is really behind, and must kill something.]
;B[qk];W[rj];B[ri]
(;W[sj]C[Gote];B[oh]C[this will be a difficult run toward the centre

[kb\]: At least you get to play first now, you have a chance of making everything live.]

(;W[hm];B[gk]
(;W[fm];B[gj]C[lucky? i found the answer

[kb\]: Yes, now you have won.];W[ef];B[eg];W[oc];B[le];W[qb]
;B[rc];W[kd]C[another aggressive move];B[kc];W[jd];B[jc];W[ld]
;B[ie];W[hf];B[je];W[md];B[ke]C[white gain nothing in the centre, from here on i was sure i can win this game.
but my concern is whether my game plan is correct? since it is too risky and my opponent  could have slice off my head.

[kb\]: It is better to reduce your opponent's influence than play the way you did.  Against a huge wall, you cannot let your opponent have overwhelming influence in the center.  However, you played a good game.
