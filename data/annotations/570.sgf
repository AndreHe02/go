C[I am playing Black. This is my first attempt at post-game analysis.

I have not figured out how to use all of the game editor features.

I am a true beginner to the game.

Alex: I'm pleased to comment on your first attempts.];B[jd]
;W[ej];B[dd];W[ji]C[I thought

he played too far from corner and I could invade and

survive.

Alex: you can invade and survive, but your opponent gets the influence. Because you play 13x13 territory is more important than influence.]
;B[jk];W[ij];B[ik];W[kk];B[kl];W[lj];B[lk];W[kj];B[ll];W[mk]
;B[ml];W[mj]C[This seemed like a good outcome for me, so I went

after the other

corner.

Alex: maybe you should reinforce your structure a little (G3)]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[ci]C[Alex: More safe would be at D4];W[dj];B[cj]
;W[ck];B[cl]LB[dl:A]C[This was a

mistake. Maybe I should have played at A instead.];W[dl];B[bk]
;W[dk];B[di]C[Alex: Defending at B2 is perhaps better.];W[bl]
;B[ak];W[al];B[bj]C[I still felt that

this outcome was OK for me.

Alex: Inefficient shape perhaps.];W[ke]C[This seemed like too close of an approach.

Alex: I think it's playable, because of the strong wall on the right.]
;B[kd];W[if];B[dg]C[It seemed like he was going after the center. I figured as long

as I keep the left and top and lower right corner, he could have

the center.

Alex: You're opponent isn't just aiming at the center, but at invading the top as well. 35 at D8 (35 is too close to your wall and to far from you're starpoint star) if you want to play there, per haps it's better to defend the top with 35 at H10 or H11.]
;W[hd]C[Alex: figures :)];B[hc]C[Alex: you don't give way: that's o.k.]
;W[fd];B[cf]LB[fc:A]C[Maybe I should have

played at A.

Alex: The focus lies on the top, not the left, so E11 or E12 is much better indeed.]
;W[eb];B[db];W[ic]C[Now I was worried about losing the top.

Alex: And you had every right to feel this way ;)];B[id];W[hb]
;B[gc];W[gb];B[ib];W[jc]
(;B[kc]C[Alex: 49 at K12 would have caught white 42 and 48]
;W[jb];B[gd];W[he];B[kb];W[ia]C[I think I really mis-played this sequence. At this point

I was

just trying to keep the upper right corner.

Alex: The right corner isn't alive yet.];B[fb]C[Alex: This is a strange move.]
;W[ge];B[fc];W[ec];B[dc];W[ld]C[Alex: If you played 55 at M9 or M10 the right corner would still be yours.]
;B[lc];W[lf]C[Alex: at this point your right corner dies. It needs a move at M13 and N12 to live, so it's virtually dead.]
;B[ff];W[ee];B[de];W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[gg]C[Alex: if you want to play here, try to atari at F6.

You have to watch for your own territory, with 69, you give your opponent just extra prisoners.]
;W[fh];B[fi];W[gf];B[gh];W[fe];B[eh];W[ff]C[Alex: OK this worked for you, but it's white's mistake.]
;B[hj];W[hi];B[gi];W[hk];B[gj];W[gk];B[fk];W[fj];B[fl];W[gl]
;B[el]C[Alex: If you play at G1 the white stones are trapped and your middle group saved. Can you see the cut at E5 ?]
;W[fm];B[hh];W[ii];B[ih];W[jh];B[hl];W[em];B[ei]C[Alex: you saw it ! :)]
;W[ig];B[md];W[le];B[me];W[mf];B[mc]LB[ma:A]C[I needed to play at A before he

killed me, I wasn't able to.

Alex: It was allready dead, so save your stones.];W[la]C[This move killed the group, but for some reason I tried to fight

on.];B[ka];W[lb]C[Alex: 104 wasn't necessary];B[ea];W[fa]C[By this point I realized I was

hopelessly lost.];B[da];W[jm]C[I resigned after 108 I might have been able to save the

group,

but not the game. Computer calculates Success: 86% confidence.

Looked at 89 positions.

Alex: with what software is this done ?]
