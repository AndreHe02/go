C[I'm white, I just want to know where and why I fell behind, what especially bad moves I made etc. Thank you

> Hi, I'm Geza Bohus, 8-9k on IGS. I preced my comments by ">".

Here are some general comments. The rest are in the game, together with some variations.
Some of these are uncommented, consider them "might-have-happened's". I have also commented on black's moves, perhaps those comments might be helpful, too.

You both played very well, much better than one would expect from 18-19k players.

One mistake you both repeatedly made was to play out many local fights even when the remaining value was just a few points while there were still big moves on the board.

You lost the game because of a few "direction of play" type of mistakes. You could have used aji provided by half-dead stones to push into what became black's large territory. You have made a few weak moves as if trying to save - hopelessly -- those stones.

Please let me know if you have any questions. You can reach me at gbohus@yahoo.com]
