C[Dear Commentator,
it's still hard for me to judge which move is the best for situation, or which move would works (i marked moves where i don't know where to move). Also i have a problem in building territory (i suppose), i lost many games becouse of being unable to get more territory (like this one i think).
As you will see i simply gave whole bottom for my opponent, but i didn't have any idea how to get it.]

(;B[mc]C[thesarge: This doesn't seem like a good move to me. You gain, 1 point maybe, and you give him a perfect wall protecting his territory, plus a strong group now facing your stone at d16]

;W[pg]C[This move was first one problematic for me, white started building territory, but i did not know how to answer so i managed only to make my group stronger.

thesarge: your group is already strong. his is weak. attack!]

;B[dl];W[pj]C[Now i realised that i can lost whole right side.

thesarge: the key is to notice that you havent lost anything. White has only 3 stones on the right side, all placed high on the 4th line. White has in no way turned this into territory. Now is a perfectly fine time to invade! It only becomes his because you dont attack, and allow him to build up his defenses later.]

(;B[qf];W[qg]C[thesarge: you play too close to your own thickness, and play a contact play which allows him to strengthen his right side. now it will be harder to invade. Only he has gained from this move]
;B[og]C[thesarge: remember, dont attack with contact moves, because contact moves make both groups stronger. you are already very strong here, so you are just letting him build up]
;W[pf];B[pe];W[of];B[ng];W[rf];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[mq]C[And bottom now:(

thesarge: it is still possible to invade anywhere: the right, the bottom, or the corner]

(;B[ki]C[But I only tried to get some territory in center.]
;W[kh];B[lh];W[li];B[jh];W[ih]C[thesarge: dont capture at L13 if you dont have to, its just a wasted move. Even if he plays at L13 first, you can capture his stone, so you can play somewhere else first]

(;B[kg];W[nf]
(;B[mg];W[pm]C[thesarge: there goes one invasion opportunity]

(;B[se]C[thesarge: this is an endgame move, worth a couple points at most. on the other hand, the entire bottom is open. Find a bigger move!]
;W[rg];B[ph];W[qh];B[pi];W[qi];B[mi]C[thesarge: still too slow and thick]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[lj];B[oj];W[pk];B[ok];W[mm]C[thesarge: See how he makes moves like this? a large two point jump out into the center. Since you play very slowly and thick, he plays the bigger moves and gets much more territory. you need to play quicker moves like this]
;B[kj];W[lk]
(;B[kk];W[ll];B[kl];W[km]C[thesarge: go proverb: dont push from behind. you will end up getting a hane like L7, which gives him nice shape but leaves you with very little influence]

;B[gn];W[go];B[fo];W[fp];B[en];W[eo]C[At least it was lucky for me that white made few mistakes (like that one).]
;B[cn];W[co]C[thesarge: good job making sure to take advantage of any mistakes he makes]
;B[dn];W[do];B[fn];W[jp]C[White is still build his territory and i still don't know how to become stronger. I became little panicked.

thesarge: this is the move you needed to play first. By playing very thickly, you waste too many moves and allow him to play the critical moves first]
;B[bo];W[bp]
(;B[an]C[thesarge: up until now you could still have invaded at r3. You may want to look at a few simple joseki like this one so you know when it is possible to attack (see variation)]

I think i had chance to win but i'm simply shouldn't allow white to get so much territory.
Can at least you show me where i could play to become bigger? (but of course feel free to show me mistkakes which i don't see, or anything)
Big thanks, radious.

thesarge: Well, the good thing is you already understand what you have to do. You have to play bigger! So play less contact plays. Dont crawl around the board, use more 1-point jumps and knight moves. And dont be afraid to attack. You seem to be too stuck on defending your territory sometimes. Making it absolutely sure that you control 10 points while your opponently just barely controls 100 is still going to lose you the game. Attack attack attack! And dont throw away half of the board because of a stone or two. There are still plenty of places to invade. Well hope that helps!]
