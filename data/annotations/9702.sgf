C[Hallo,
my name is Ulrich (alias pmurk). I am 14k on IGS and will try to give 
hints and comments. 
I will use the prefix u:.
Please keep in mind that the strength difference is only 4 stones. 
From your comments I assume that you play white.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[ce]C[u: Chines opening by B - I like 
that a lot. W C15 seems a little slow but is solid.];B[jd];W[dk]
C[u: if B plays around K4 W faces 2 walls with a light connection. KGS score estimates this with a lead by 70 points.]

(;B[pn]C[u: This invites W to play
 around K4 which happened. This seems to slow to me.];W[jq]
;B[gc];W[mc]C[Thought it stronger to invade here instead of 
extending towards the bottom right

u: This is an aggressive move. B needs to decide to push and let you run (resulting in a reduction) or to seal you in an give away some territory.]

(;B[nc]C[u: B should not connect - proverb "Do not touch a weak stone". see i. e. http://senseis.xmp.net/?DontTouchWeakStones]
;W[nd]C[u: W's reaction is fine - "if attach - hane" is very often good.]
;B[oc];W[ld]C[u: Building the tiger mouth is strong];B[kc]
(;W[kf];B[ec]SQ[pf][qf][pg][qg][ph][qh][pi][qi]C[u: 
a) again - B should not attach
b) in the marked area there is room for damage - think this is not a good place.
c) not further attacking the single group N17 is strange];W[ed]

the left?];B[hq];W[fp];B[gr];W[go];B[jr];W[kq];B[lr];W[kr];B[ks]

have ended the ko there.];B[fo];W[fn];B[lq];W[lp];B[mp];W[fp]

at F15];B[je];W[jf];B[gf];W[gg];B[hg];W[fg];B[hh];W[gh];B[hi]
;W[gi];B[jh]C[Should I have answered this or kept was it more correct 
to take the lead in the race between the walls n G and H and hane like 
I did?];W[hj];B[if];W[jg];B[ii];W[kh];B[ki];W[mh];B[mi];W[li]

have made more of the shape, reducing black on the right.];W[ik]

 feared black cut and reduction in threatending the group I had built 
to M8];B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[kd];B[jb];W[lm];B[ml];W[fe];B[eb]
;W[ea];B[fa];W[da];B[qh];W[fd];B[gd];W[ms]CR[ls]C[Rather silly, going where marked 
would have perhaps resulted in a reduction?

Had it in my mind I could kill blacks group here.];B[ls];W[do]
C[I think we're both cautious. Looking at this I 
think there was some chance of creating life in my territory and a few 
cuttable points in blacks line.])
