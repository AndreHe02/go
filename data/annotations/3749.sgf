C[I am playing black in this game.  I thought my opponent was a bit stronger than me, but I felt I held my own into the midgame.  Towards the end, the game slipped away from me and I lost by around 60 points.

I would particularly appreciate advice about the fight for the center about moves 59-81.5]

(;B[pn]C[At this point I think black is concentrating his stones more then necessary.  R4 Q5 together are a strong group, so while whites pressuring move at P5 feels strong, its really a defensive move to combat your strength.  You might have done better with a move like R7, or Q3.  see variations

The basic idea is to not over concentrate your stones unnecessarily.  Spread out where you can, and try to make territory, or at least setup the potential for it.

strong means (for me at least) nice eye space, no, or little, bad potential to exploit, and lots of liberties.]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[cd]C[This is a blunder as you suspected.  Whites group in the lower right is pretty nearly settled (with wS2 bS4 wS1 white is completely settled), and has some nice moves round K4 that would use the shape of the group to build a good sized moyo.

Black is less fortunate in that this group's eye space is open to attack.  Additionally, black's escape routes are limited because with such an attack (R8 say) black has to make life or try to run to the centre, and both of these present difficulties due to the looseness of black's shape at this point.  In short, black is weak here and this group needs soem help for before you can move to another arena on the board.]
;W[ql]C[This comes down to your judgement about what makes a strong or weak group.  Ask things like: are there any moves white can make that would be sente against this group; is the eye space its depending on easily accessible; if this group got cut off and the opponent had sente, could it still live; finally what are its options for connecting to other groups on the board?

Looking at this example one sees that white has a sente move to make at S5 or S2 because bS3 is weak. The eye space is accessible  ie white can play almost in it and still escape along the side.  If we imagined white had stones at P6 and P7 as well it not too hard to see that black would definately die here if it was white's turn, and it would be tough going even if black had sente.  As for connecting to other groups if all else fails, there are no other groups near by at all.  All told black has a number of weaknesses and no recourses should things go badly.  

With that in mind, the notion that you need to play near weak groups (both your own and the opponents) and avoid playing near strong groups (both your own and the opponents) is perhaps clearer.

-I'm still unsure of myself in opening corner fights.  In retrospect, C16 was a mistake; I think I should have played R8 or R9.-]
;B[pl];W[qk];B[pk];W[pj];B[qm];W[om];B[pm];W[qh];B[qe];W[dj]
;B[jd];W[jp];B[cm];W[cg];B[cj];W[ci];B[ck];W[co];B[em]C[This is perhaps too slow.  see next comment]
;W[jm]C[White makes a move to stop you and simutenously make his moyo much bigger.  K6 might have been a nice place for move 31.

K9 isn't so attractive due to black's pressence at Q9 and easy sente move at P10.  

K9 seems like a big point for white -- he's got a nice boxline moyo in the lower right.  I'm not sure how to approach his lower right.]
;B[gp]C[F4 is more in line with your E7 stone.  It would have saved you from playing the defensive move you were forced to play later.  It also limits, to a greater degree, the size of whites corner.]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[fr];B[fo];W[ed]C[There is a weak white group just below this corner, and this stone is now weak also.  Split them apart and attack two weak groups at the same time, from one corner.  See variations for some ideas.]

(;B[dc];W[ec];B[cf];W[dg];B[df];W[ef]
(;B[gc]C[This move is a wasted move.  The following sequence is all white's sente, and he makes territory in the spot you just played G17.  It would be better to cut at E13,  White then has two groups to make live, or play H17 for a similar style move, without the bad aji (potential) of G17.]
;W[ic];B[id]C[White plays; black responds.  White is in control.]
;W[hc];B[hd]C[White plays; black responds.  White is in control.]
;W[gb];B[gd];W[fb];B[jc];W[jb];B[kb]C[White plays; black responds.  White is in control.]
;W[ib];B[lc]C[White was in control through that whole sequence, and G17 was entirely undone by white.  The real kicker follows next.

-I was happy with the way the fight in the upper left went.  Seems like I got a strong wall and territory in the upper right.-]
;W[fg]C[White fixes his biggest weakness on the board, and gets to do that after taking profit on the upper side.  The exchange from G17 to F13 should leave a horrible taste in black's mouth.  Here in point form is why...

-White held sente through out
-White made profit in what was your moyo
-White nicely canceled the outer influence black built during the sequence with one move: F13
-Black's upper left corner is now sealed away and can be thought of as dead for everything but counting
-White fixed his biggest weakness after having made some profit.

All told, I think you've misjudged that sequence.

(Here things look pretty even to me, but I'm not sure where to play next.  The center seems biggest to me, but I was a bit of a loss to choose where to play.)]
;B[pg]C[I like this.  pressure the weak to build territory in the middle.]
;W[ng]C[This is outlandish for white.];B[ne]C[This is unnecessary for black.  Q13 was putting pressure on white, so put more pressure on that white group and cut off O13 from support.  Divide and conquer!]
;W[on]
(;B[oj]C[See variation for a different move order hat works better here.]
;W[pi]
(;B[ok]C[Divide and conquer, or at least try ie P11.  More often then not, cutting between two weak groups will work, even when it gets messy.  The aggressor usually gets a move or two in sente due to the weakness of the groups being cut apart.  So even when it seems to get really messy, like here, you stand a godo chance to come out ahead, or atleast not take too much of a lose. See variations]
;W[oi]C[White is now nicely connected out into the centre, even though you had the option to cut this group off from the centre.]

;W[fj];B[jq];W[kq];B[iq];W[kp];B[ip]C[What does this move do for you?  Does it make some profit?  Does it pressure a weak white group?  Does it fix some weakness in your shape?  

I don't think it does any of these.];W[hg]
(;B[jg]C[I'm not sure what this move is intended for.  It can't make you much terriotry, and there are no weak white groups to cut off or pressure in the area.  

Maybe P12 to see what white does for O13.  See variations.]
;W[lg];B[li]C[Again, what affect are you trying for with this move?  Make territory, pressure a weak group, fix a weakness of your own?]
;W[hj]C[White is making more points.];B[gl]C[There is often no profit in the centre.  Most profit comes for the sides and corners.  This is particularly evident in this game where the centre "fight" isn't amounting to much, if any, profit for either side.  The centre is generally where the last fights over life and death take place, not the last ditch effort to get points.  

Your focus, as always, is on making territory or preventing white from making it.  Your main tool for this is putting pressure on weak groups of the opponent, so it is crucial that you make an effort to make white's groups weak ie cut between them.

"I was really improvising througout this fight for the center.  I felt like I had little intuition as to where I should focus."]

(;B[pe];W[of];B[oe];W[cq]C[This is over caution on white's part I think.  Black may have been able to live there with a ko, but no more.]
;B[il]C[This move is a little unfocussed.  It kinda makes territory with F5 etc, and it kinda makes territory with M11 etc, but it also kinda fails to do either because white is so close.  It might be better to try and attack whites territory and let those moves build those spaces up.

If you are worried about the life of your side group, make some end game moves to ensure its safety.  S2 works great to get an eye and take whites territory away.  S8 is also a big move that would settle that group and take some territory.  S2 is in sente, while S8 isn't, so S2 is better.]

(;B[hl];W[io];B[jj]C[End game moves shoudl focus on sente moves.  That is, moves that make your opponent respond and therefore let you make another move.  

This is a purely defensive move, one that doesn't even save you from much loss.  wL9 undoes this move completely.]
;W[ke];B[je]C[Is this connection needed for any of your grousp to live?  I don't feel it is, so L16 is a better defensive move, or this might be your chance to take sente back.]

;B[js];W[jr];B[ir];W[ks];B[is]C[There are bigger things on the board besides saving K1.  K1 is a single point.  B6 is sente, and it saves you from the huge attack that follows.  It is worth in the neighborhood of 20-30 points, 10-12 for the amount of territory you have there, 3 or 4 for the amount you take from white by playing at B6, and since the move is in sente the common notion is that you double the moves worth.]

General comments.  

Identitfying weakness and strength, both in your groups and the opponents, is one of the most fundamental requirements of good play.  If you are constantly fixing up groups that are in perfect shape, you fall behind easily.  On the other hand, if you leave weak groups all over the board, the opponent has a field day attacking them, and making profit all the while. Properly analyzing the strength of the groups on the board would have saved you a number of painful situations and opened up a number of opportunities for you to attack white.  

Next is the concept of sente.  Regardless of what point your at in the game, sente should be guarded jealously, and only given up out of nessecity.  Never make a fixing move just because you think it needs it.  Know for sure you need to fix your group before you give sente up to make such a move.  The most powerful moves are those that defend and attack and let you keep sente.  

The end game can be incredibly important.  A move around B6 (I mentioned it earlier) would have saved you some 15 points, maybe more.  If you had at the same time saved the group in the upper left, the score would have been with in 20.  the remainder could have been reduced had your end game given up for less then you ended up doing.  Sente is substantially more important in the end game then at any other point in the game.  He who has sente for the majority of the end game can win back 20 + points!!  Avoid playing into gote, and always try to get sente.

Perhaps biggest of all, don't follow your opponent around responding to their every move.  Always look for ways you can ignore your opponents move, and go your own way.  Best of all, respond to their moves by forcing them to make a move, thus winning you sente, and then go your own way then.
