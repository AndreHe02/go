C[Hi. My name is Raidhyn and I once was around 5Kyu. I've been out of practice for a while but I'm happy for the opportunity to review your game and hopefully provide some pointers.]
;B[pp];W[qd];B[dp];W[dc]
(;B[oc]C[This is a paticularly agressive move that leads to some trouble for you. Playing on the third line like this means that you want to build a base over there on white's side, but you had the opportunity to play a very natural extension at D15 or even C15 or C14. Typically you should look to extend from your position to maintain stronger position and only go deep like this when nessecary or if you're playing to a paticular strategy or playstyle. 

See the variations at move 4 for examples of other options and white's possible follow ups. (These aren't joseki, just options)]
;W[od]C[This always seems agressive, and I rarely know how to respond to attatchment after I attempted to preclude and enclosure.

-----------

It is an agressive move, but don't feel threatened, just be prepared to respond appropriately. 

On attachment like this you almost always have to respond locally. You've been attacked and should reply by providing reinforcement for your stone. Typically you will either extend, or hane. 

See the varations for more details.]
(;B[lc]C[So i backed out and made a base.

----

This is a mistake and you get punished for it afterwards.

Although the two space extension like this is strong, it's only reccomended if you aren't being attacked at the time. With P17 threatened, this move is inviting white to attack. 

Over reliance on the two space extension is very common at the 15kyu level. It's a strong move but only when appropriate.]
;W[nc]C[Here you have a few options. Your base has been invaded, you need to decide to cut or play underneath. Playing on the second line is generally weak so I would have gone with a cut here. See the variation for possible continuation...]

(;B[nb];W[ob];B[mb]C[Cutting my losses..


-----

Yep. Good choice.];W[pc];B[ic]C[another base attempt

-

This is solid. Good play.];W[gc];B[ce]C[Is this an appropriate time and place for tenuki?

-----

Yes I think this is good. Remember that this was one of your original options except that now at this position white has a stone at G17 and is already strong here. This means he can attack you with more vigor.]
;W[cg]C[And he attacks with a pincer.];B[ee];W[eg]
(;B[bc]C[Is this idea correct in response to the pincer?

---

Yes this is one option. See the variations for other choices.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[de]C[See varations for a more agressive response. I would have gone for the atari here.]

(;B[cf];W[df];B[bg];W[ch];B[bh];W[cj];B[cb]C[Good.];W[db];B[ca]
C[It's too early to play on the first line here. This would have been a good time to tenuki instead and play somewhere big.]
;W[da];B[cm]C[I  had trouble deciding between this and the normal knights move approach. Should I be approaching my own corners in such a way?]
;W[cc];B[bb];W[bi]
(;B[af]C[I THINK this move is uneeded. It makes you feel safer, but you didn't need to respond this early. See varaitions at last move.]
;W[ge];B[ie];W[jd]C[This is very agressive.];B[id]C[Solid.]
;W[jc]
(;B[je]C[was K18 better?

---- 

K18 is more passive but this is also a good option since you have some strength to attack with. Going with K18 would have given white a wall on the outside. See the varation at last move for this.]
;W[ld];B[kd]C[Attack!];W[kc];B[ke];W[lb];B[mc];W[kb];B[md];W[le]
;B[lf]C[Good ladder.];W[me];B[ne];W[ib];B[hb];W[hc]C[Instead of going atari there are some other possibilities here...remember the proverb to extend once and then sacrifice.]

(;B[ia];W[jb];B[la];W[gb]
(;B[pj]C[would capturing with N14 have been better here? I didnt want to waste the move, but then I wound up being forced to respond to the ladder breaker anyway.

----

I like this move because it takes a big point on the board.]
;W[oh];B[mf];W[oe];B[of];W[pf];B[jp]C[I feel constantly drawn to this move, but think that I never really know what to do with it.

----

This is a good move all on it's own. It's the biggest point on the board right now and this was probably the best move for white or black.]
;W[eq]C[I don't like this. White is being agressive where he shouldn't be.]

;W[fr]TR[do][cq]C[White has just protected his position and you should do the same now. When there are two places to cut you should always look to fortify.]
