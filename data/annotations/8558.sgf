Hi Valentin, my name is David.  I will try to keep the English simple, but please email if you have any questions.

Before I start, one comment.  I noticed that you won this game.  Usually the best games to review are the losses, because there is more to learn.  I'll certainly review this one, but in the future I would recommend that you submit games that you lose but just a little bit.  They are usually the best for learning.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[fc];W[np]CR[fc][cd]SQ[dj]C[This is an unusualy move for white (W).  The usual response to a shimari by black (B) is to block the extension (square).]
;B[cn];W[hc]TR[fq]SQ[cl]C[Very questionable move by W.  The square is much better.  The lone W stone is so weak that black can ignore it and play at the triangle.]
;B[mc]SQ[fq]C[Not the best response.  H17 is totally weak.  Better to play F3 for a big advantage.  Remember: do not follow your opponent unless you have to.  Play where YOU want to play.]
;W[kc];B[bp]SQ[fp][fq]C[Wrong move.  Better to play on the other side.  F3 is normal, but F4 is okay if you want influence.]
;W[cq];B[dj]TR[fc][cd][cl][cn][bp]SQ[dl][gp][fq][gq]C[in my opinion this moves are working excellent together, but could you do it better?

This move could be much more aggressive.  The B shape is okay (see below), but the W shape is VERY weak.  D10 allows W to fix this shape for free.  The best move is to keep W's group weak (around G3).  Don't try to kill it, but use the weakness to build a nice group on the bottom.

IF W has a stable shape (e.g. white stone at F3), D8 is best.  D10 leaves unnecessary weakness at C8 (triangle).  The usual rule is: "Play C9 if W controls the top left corner, play D8 if B controls the top left corner."]
;W[cl]C[Too aggressive from W!  Now W has two weak groups.  Just stay safe and you can punish this.]
;B[en]C[is 15 a good answer to 14?

Yes, this is good.  You MUST keep the W groups separate.];W[bi]
C[Blagh, horrible from W!  This allows you to press for a huge advantage.]
(;B[bj]C[Not correct.  Remember, the 2nd line is the line of death.  You can press him (see variations).  Any time your opponent drops to the 2nd line you should think "PRESS PRESS PRESS!"]
;W[cj];B[ck];W[ci];B[bk];W[dk];B[dl];W[ek];B[bl];W[ej]C[This looks like a good outcome for B, but the alternatives are MUCH better.]
;B[ge]SQ[pj][fp][gq]C[I don't like this.. it is focused too locally.  It can come later.  You have sente and there are still very important moves on the board.]
;W[di];B[fq]C[There we go.. this could have been much earlier.  I prefer G3, but this is fine.]
;W[er]SQ[fp]C[Gah, W likes the 2nd line too much.  I think F4 is much better.  Now you think: PRESS!]
(;B[fr]C[Wrong way.  See variation.];W[eq]
(;B[jq]TR[dp][fp][eq]C[No.. this shows why F2 is wrong.  Now W has a powerful move at F4.  You cannot allow him to form the tiger's mouth shape.  See variation.  Never give your opponent the chance to form this shape against you.]
(;W[lq]SQ[fp]C[Bad!!  W is using the O4 group completely wrong.  High stones are for influence.  F4 is correct.  M3 is horrible.]
;B[jo]C[Wrong idea.. F4 is the most important.  It connects you to E6 and blocks W from playing there.  K5 is not that big.]
;W[ln]C[This stone is aimless.. what is the point?  What does it accomplish?  Q10 is already big, this makes it even bigger.  You must play there!]
;B[pj]C[Good!];W[pl]C[Again, terrible.  Look how cramped W is.  5 stones that are horribly placed.  M3 was the start of the problem here.]
;B[nj];W[pg];B[qf]SQ[rd][re]C[I don't like this move because it strengthens W.  If you play close to a weak stone you make it stronger.  I like the marked moves better.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[qg];B[pf]TR[of]C[This is bad.  There is a go proverb that you should "never push from behind."  This allows W to play at the triangle, which is very bad for B.  This is why R14 was bad.  It makes W stronger.]
(;W[rg]SQ[of]C[NO!!!  What is the point of this stone?!?!?  W likes the 2nd line way too much.  P14 is correct.  See variations.]
(;B[rf]C[Wrong way.  You want to go over the top.  See variation.]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[si];B[rh];W[sh];B[og];W[oh];B[pi];W[ph];B[ng]
;W[nh];B[mh]TR[ql]C[Too aggressive!  W can punish you dearly.  R8 is necessary.  Don't try to kill your opponent.. just keep him weak and make profit.  Let him live.]
(;W[mi]C[This is a mistake by W.  He could actually escape.  See variations.]
;B[ni];W[mg];B[lh];W[lg];B[kh];W[of];B[nf];W[oe];B[ne];W[pe]
C[W is desparate now.  Bad play.];B[qe];W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[md]
;W[kf];B[lj]C[Not necessary.];W[me];B[nc];W[le];B[id]C[Interesting idea.  F4 is still open though >_<]
;W[hd]
(;B[ie]C[No.. you cannot allow yourself to become separated.  You must be okay with sacrificing J16.  See variation.]
;W[he];B[hf]TR[gf][if]C[Now you have two cutting points.  H15 is much better.]
;W[ic]TR[if]C[Strange choice by W, I would cut.]
(;B[jd]CR[id][ie]TR[je]C[Very ugly.  The marked shape is called an "empty triangle" when the K15 is empty.  It is very inefficient.  Defending the cutting point is much better.  K16 doesn't accomplish anything.]
;W[kd];B[jf];W[mf]C[No idea why W played this.];B[gj]SQ[lb]
[ql][fp][bq][kr]C[This is an aimless move.  It does not gain much territory, if any.  F4 is much bigger.  So are B3, L2, M18, R8, and even D13.]
;W[el]SQ[gb][lb][ql][fp][bq][kr]C[Very small.  At this point in the game the "endgame" looking moves are actually quite big, especially if they are sente.  When you get to a point where you're not sure what to do, look for those moves.]
;B[dm]C[Not necessary.  Choose something bigger.];W[hl];B[gm]
SQ[gb][lb][ql][fp][bq][kr]C[This is still small compared to the others.]
;W[gl];B[hm]C[Bad.  See move 45.  This allows W to push you down.]
;W[fm];B[fn];W[fp]C[Doh!  Big loss.  There is a better way for W to play this too.  See variation at 103.]
;B[gp];W[gq]
(;B[fo];W[ep];B[gr]C[No.. you will have to sacrifice this group.  H3 is better.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[hr];B[iq];W[gs];B[ir];W[fs];B[km]C[Again, this is too small.  Almost no gain in points.]
;W[lm];B[kl];W[ij]C[No good from W.  This stone can get cut off, as you do.]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[hj];W[gh];B[ii];W[hh];B[fg];W[fh];B[il]C[Disaster for W.  There is no way you should own the whole middle.]
;W[eg];B[ff];W[cf];B[df];W[dg];B[de];W[ef];B[ee];W[gd];B[fe]
C[Why not F16?];W[fd];B[ed];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[bd];W[rm]C[Odd move by W.. why not at S8?]
;B[ql];W[qm];B[rl];W[ec];B[eb];W[dc];B[db];W[fb];B[cc];W[gc]
;B[dd]C[This is actually a very small move, better to take sente elsewhere.  W cannot play here.]
;W[fc]C[W also should not make this move.. extremely small.]
;B[ih]SQ[lb][af][ai][sm][bq][kr]C[I don't think this move gains you any points at all.  Marked moves are huge at this point.  Invading the bottom right may also be huge.]
;W[hg];B[ig];W[jc]C[Small and gote.. terrible.]
(;B[om]C[This is not a great choice for invading.  You know that Q7 is a weakness, so playing at P7 forces W to fix that weakness.  You should play somewhere else.  O7 is better, or maybe P4 for a fight.]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[nm];B[mm];W[nn];B[on]SQ[ml]C[This is the wrong idea.  When invading a secure territory you should just take what you can get.  N8 is correct.  See variations for some better invasions.]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[oo];B[mk];W[ll];B[bq]C[Good.  This has been big for a long time.]
;W[br];B[fk]SQ[lb][af][ai][sm][ar][kr]C[Bad.  This is a waste of a ko threat.  There are MUCH bigger moves.]
;W[fl];B[af]C[Good.];W[bg];B[lb]C[Good!];W[kb];B[lo]C[Overplay.  See variation.]
(;W[mo];B[kp];W[lp];B[ko];W[kn];B[jn];W[jj];B[hi];W[kk];B[lk]
;W[mn];B[jk];W[ag];B[ar]C[Good.];W[bs];B[kg]SQ[sm][kr]C[This is small and not sente.]
;W[ke];B[sm];W[sn];B[sl];W[ro];B[pk];W[ok];B[oj]C[Why did you make this move?  It gains nothing.]
;W[pm];B[qn];W[pn]
(;B[ls]C[Bad.  See variation.  L2 is correct.]

B crushes W.  That is part of why it's best to submit a game you don't win.  There is more to learn.  But there are certainly lessons from this game.

1. Early game shape.  Know how to play against a 4,4 stone.  Learn the double-approach attack (move 9 at F3).  Learn the proper place for move 13 (D8 if you own the other corner, C9 if your opponent owns it.)

2. If your opponent drops to the 2nd line, PRESS!  (See move 16)

3. Moves 33, 45 and 97.  Do not push from behind or allow your opponent to play over the top of your stones.

4. Do not allow yourself to become separated (move 83).

5. "Endgame" moves are worth more than random stones in the center (see the moves I mark at move 91 and many many times after that).

If you work on those points your game will improve by a lot.  In your next game try to be the first player to take the "endgame" moves.]
