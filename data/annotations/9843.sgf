C[Hello Jeff,

My name is Wannes Fransen, 20 years old and playing Go since January. I'll be doing you review.
I'm 7k on KGS and 12k on E.G.D., this means that I'll say things and correct things that I would or wouldn't do, but this doesn't mean that it is incorrect. After all I'm also learning to get better :)

Anyway lets see how the game went!

** Edited this game in KGS editor **

(if you watch this game with KGS editor, you can see possible moves and variations in the 'tree' below the chatbox. It is possible that this window starts very small. *very small as in you'll only see the upper border*)]
;B[qd]C[Perfect move! When I started playing, I only played the hoshi points (simpler joseki and I played a lot of handicap games, so then you can use the same strategy).
Well to be honest, I might be around 12k and I still only play hoshi points.. maybe I should follow your example and experiment a bit more :p]
;W[me];B[cp]C[Ignoring that odd white move and calmly taking another corner is a good call!]
;W[cc]
(;B[ep]C[Not a bad move, but I'd first take that other corner. The one that's first 'in' the corner has a slight advantage.]
;W[of];B[qp]C[You really love the 3-4 point don't you :) well in the beginning it doesn't really matter, but keep in mind that later on (SDK levels) that you'll have to make your joseki work together.]
;W[pg]
(;B[qj]C[Your upper right corner is under pressure. I'd prefer to make a base (this move isn't bad, though I think closing your corner takes priority, just to be safe)

Another proverb you can follow: 'Play away from strength'];W[ie]
;B[jq]C[Beautiful move! it gives a sort of 'Double Wing formation' around your R4 stone.]
;W[rd]
(;B[ci]C[The left side is big indeed, with C4 and E4, this move is a very good call.. Yet i thing that your upper right takes priority again. if you leave it be like this, It's kinda a lost situation there (if he would do another move there)]
;W[rk]
(;B[rl]C[I'd prefer to 'flatten' white. Even if W were to get a whole line on the S line and B get a whole line on the R line, this is a better result for B then the few points for W.]
;W[cf];B[qk]C[Now you had to spend 2 moves for a single stone, whilst white got C14 'for free'. that upper white box is getting big!]
;W[hc]
(;B[ih]LB[fi:A][mi:B]TR[cl][gq][oq]C[if you are to make a moyo(framework), then this would be a bit too big. there are 2 reasons:
-there are still holes at A and B
-lot of invasion points

I'd personally play N10 (works nice with your wall and you're making a box) or enclose your corner at P3. Though keep in mind that the upper right corner is still yours to take!]
;W[ei];B[ej]C[There you have it :p poking at your hole. Blocking off like this is normal. Dangerous though, you might need to sacrifice a bit to keep your territory safe!]
;W[di]
(;B[fi]C[you might thing  that you're blocking off, though you're just creating more cutting points whilst still keeping a small hole at D10.

you can look at the other sequences i've played out, just to get an idea of what could happen :)]
;W[cj];B[dj]C[Well now it sort of a mess.. you should make peace with the fact that a big part of your territory will be gone :( though cutting here looks normal to do]
;W[ck]
(;B[cl]C[Bad call here, if you want to keep someone else out of your territory, don't try to attach stones. play from a distance and yes, you'll lose a bit territory,  but this would be better then attaching imo.]
;W[bi]
(;B[bj]C[Woops, didn't see that atari? that an important stone because if you were to extend and save him from the capture, the 2 W stones at D11 are in danger!

if you look at the sequence, you sacrifice 3 stones in order to get a nice wall for your territory. This is something i'd try]
;W[hh]
(;B[dk]C[Giving atari while you are in atari doesn't really work :) and ignoring another poke in your 'wall' for your territory is very dangerous!]
;W[bk]
(;B[ak]C[Uhm.. how should i say this.. Nope :) doenst work, if you would use  the atari to get a wall, B8 would've been better i think :)

( you can take a quick look at the other sequences, it's basically a big fight. a lot can happen)]
;W[ch];B[bl];W[aj]
(;B[al]C[Is saving that one stone such a big priority?

possible variations in sequences below :)];W[mo]C[WOW! invading at its best :')]

(;B[lo]C[remember what i said about attaching stones? same applies here. It's better to keep a safe distance, make sure he cant connect to a living group and make eyes.]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[el]LB[fj:A][cm:B];B[fl]C[Woops, Bye bye stones :)]
;W[fj];B[em];W[ek];B[gj];W[cm];B[cn];W[nq];B[bm]C[Well.. I would've given the D8 group and focussed on that N5 invasion, but now it's kinda getting scary to watch :)]
;W[ii];B[fk]C[There are other priorities again, though i don't think this move is particulary bad. Just odd timing :)

Keep in mind that the upper right corner is getting very big now!]
;W[ql]
(;B[ij]C[giving up the S8 stone is not very good right now, this would give W a chance to make a base for his N5 invasion.]
;W[rm];B[pl];W[qm];B[sl]C[Well this doesn't work :)];W[sk];B[pm]
;W[qr]C[your B corner stone is about to be cut off!];B[mq];W[pn]
;B[qn];W[rn];B[qo];W[mr]
(;B[ro]C[you have to spend a lot stones at a slight chance of getting those 2 W groups (S7 and S9), instead of this move, focus on saving whats left of your territory!

(not sure for a good sequence for B, but below is what i'd try)]
;W[ri];B[sn];W[sm];B[rj];W[op];B[sj];W[rq];B[sl];W[qe]
(;B[rl]C[No need to capture it! at the end of the game the group will be counted as dead. your upper right corner is in peril!

also keep an eye out to reduce potential enemy territory, if you had kept that upper right corner, you might've won!

Good luck and have fun on your go journey!])
