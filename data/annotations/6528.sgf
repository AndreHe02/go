AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello!

Thanks for reviewing this game!

 I hope you can give me some general advices about the direction of play and some tactical & strategical improvements.

 Greetings, Nikolai

Nikolai Bubb: another one? congratulations!
Michael B. Steffensen: All power to yose (endgame).

White: 74 territories + 6 prisoners + 0.5 komi = 80.5
Black: 71 territories + 15 prisoners = 86
Result: B+5.5

[NM\] I thought that you generally played a good end game, apart from omitting F13

In the beginning K3 I dont think was best move. i think you were lucky that Black did not attack your weak groups more. 

I think overall the top left hand corner decided the outcome. If you had attacked more there rather than playing solid there might have been a chance in the game.
Sorry I cannot help more, mybe we can play on KGS sometime, My nickname is (rhubarb)]
