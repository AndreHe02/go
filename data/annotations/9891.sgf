C[Dear reviewer, this is a game I recently played at a tournament. I play Black. I recorded it from memory up to a certain point. The game is rather typical of my style. I thought the game was going rather well for me and I was clearly ahead (like 20 points or so) at the point where the recording ended. I did make several mistakes in the endgame (but no huge ones) and lost by 8 points in the end. So my questions are: Do you see any general improvements in my playing style? Was my estimation of the score way off? My own remarks are marked with AB. Thank you for your comments!



Hey Andre,

My comments are addressed with GC. At positions with variations in it, I marked your in-game move witha  triangle, and variations with a square. I think some things in the opening could be improved upon, but it ended up nicely with some good moyo play. I think you missed a few chances with white's reductions in the midgame to get some more profit, but it worked out alright.

At the end of this record, you say you think you were winning, which I agree with. However, the difference was not as big as you believed it to be. I counted black winning by 6-7 points, not 20, which can easily be overturned. White also looked like he had better endgame potential than you, but I didn't look that carefully. It seems like endgame decided the game. But unfortunately, since the endgame was not recorded, I cannot give any comments on it. I would have liked to see how the game ended. However, thanks for letting me review the game. If you have any further questions, please email me. I'm happy to explain things in more detail.

C[GC: Answering white's approach at O17 is generally the best move with the san-ren-sei. A double approach to a 4-4 stone is quite valuable, especially in this case. White should be able to make something on the right side, which makes the Q10 stone less useful, or will force you into bad shape. The result was okay, but you ended up with not great shape.. I'll show some diagrams. Both M17 and Q14 are much more normal ways of playing. I would probably pick Q14 here, but both are fine.

GC: Also, K4 seems a little odd to me. I think enclosing the corner is a better way to move along the bottom. White's D3 stone will prevent you from mkaing a large amount of territory on that side. It also lessens the impact of the 3-3.]

(;B[jp];W[qq]C[AB: Conincidently, in another game at the same tournament my opponent invaded exactly like this right away. Is this so urgent? I mean, ok, the K4 stone is maybe not well placed, but I still welcome this very much, I think.

GC: No it isn't urgent, but it's a good place to go. Basically, after this move, either the Q10 stone of the K4 stone will look out of place, and will be less useful.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq]LB[nq:A]C[AB: Should I play O3 for sente?]
;W[or]LB[nr:A]C[AB: Should I double hane? Anyway, I thought the standard joseki gives a good-enough result for me...

GC: I think it could be good here. The normal result is okay, but K10 will be misplaced afterwards, meaning it's not a good result.]

(;B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn]LB[jp:A]C[GC: The K4 stone is now not in a good position now. Imagine a board position identical to this, but A was not there. Would you then play A? I wouldn't. Thinking this way can often help deciding josekis: "This move looks good now, but after this sequence, will any of my stone seem bad?"]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od]
;W[mb]TR[nd][od][ne]C[GC: This result is considered better for white, even with your large moyo. The shape here is just not good.]
;B[me]C[AB: I hesitated a bit, because I wasn't sure this was sente.]
;W[ld];B[de];W[ee];B[ef];W[ed];B[dg]TR[ce]SQ[ff]C[GC: I think white should have played F14 here. Would be much better strategically. The thickness black gets isn't that useful because white has the D3 stone.]

(;W[ce];B[cf]TR[cd]SQ[be]C[GC: A note, normal joseki is B15.]
;W[cd]TR[do]SQ[gf]C[GC: The normal move after this joseki is G14. However I think omitting it in this case is good. The reason G14 is normall played is because G16 is such a good followup afterwords on a more empty board. However, since white is thick at the top right, the top area isn't that interesting, and doesn't care about G14.]

(;B[do]C[AB: Is this too far?

GC: See previous move.];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[dl]
TR[nj]SQ[le][nh]C[GC: D8 is is a great move.

GC: I want to talk about white's move here. White has two large areas the think about. First, can I make my top area/moyo bigger? How do I deal with black's moyo on the right? M15 is a nice looking move that does both of these things. It's the move at the "border between moyos", which can generally be considered good. However, in this case, because of white's territorial play in the top-left corner, his moyo isn't as big as yours.

GC: Which leads me to O12. This move looks kind of funny, but I think it is quite flexible and will help to make shape easily. See variations.]

(;W[nj]LB[qj:A]TR[oj]SQ[oh][lj]C[AB: I thought this was way too deep... If anything, R10 could pose problems.

GC: I don't think it's too deep, it's more that is doesn't take advantage of Q14. See pervious move for comments about this.

GC: Now onto P10. I think this move is okay, but it's a little too defensive. It strengthens you, but it also strengthens white. If you want to take points, I think P12 is better. If you want to attack, you should just do it directly at M10.]

(;B[oj]C[AB: Hoping that this one protects againts the R10 threat...

GC: If black plays R10 you should be pretty happy. He will have multiple groups to deal with. R10 would be an overplay.]
;W[nl]C[GC: This move i completely off for white. Should definitely be O12.]
;B[lj]C[AB: Now from above, is that a good idea? I thought it might work with the left side...

GC: Normally I would have preferred to play this without P10, but seeing as O8 was played, this move is actually really good now.]
;W[ll];B[mk]C[GC: Good. This is nice. White's shape is bad.]
;W[kn]TR[nn]SQ[ml]C[GC: Honestly, here I think you should just push an cut. You take plenty. His shape is terrible. Sure O6 defends a but for you, but it also force him to defend a cut. You want to preserve cuts if possible. Your stones are the stones are the ones that are strong. Also, there is no cut there right now.]

(;B[nn];W[nm];B[nk]LB[mn:B][on:A]C[AB: Wasn't sure about this one, but I didn't think P6 or N6 were putting that much pressure on White, so I went for profit...

GC: Should have just cut first, but yes, I think taking profict here is okay.]
;W[mn];B[no];W[le]C[GC: This is really big for white, but white kind of needs another move.]
;B[in]C[AB: I thought White's last move was an overplay...

GC: Good. White's shape is pretty flexible, but I agree. This should be a good attack.]
;W[lg];B[ng];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]TR[qf]SQ[jl]C[GC: I'm very tempted to ignore this.]

(;B[qf];W[im];B[hm];W[il]TR[hl]SQ[jn]C[GC: As you mention, you thought about J6. I think J6 works out better here unforunately. Letting white play J6 lets him settle too easily. Then he is free to invade the left.]

(;B[hl]LB[jn:A]C[AB: Normally I think K6 is better shape, but I thought that White is not is grave danger and my move works better with the left side...]
;W[jn]C[AB: Of course!];B[gf]C[AB: I thought this one was urgent.
This is quite big.];W[gh]C[AB: Again, this invasion seemed weird to me...

GC: This move is actually very good. Good balance. Not too far, but still annoying.]

(;B[gg]C[GC: You seem to like hitting your opponents stones. Remember, if you want to attack a group, try not to play contact moves. They tend to make your enemy stronger. "Attack an opponent from afar". Your stones in the area are already very strong. Oh looking ahead, you did this for the connection. Hmmm. I'm not sure that's worth it. See variations.]
;W[hi];B[gd]C[AB: Very happy now. I thought I am ahead now as White does not have any large territory (despite three and a half corners).

GC: I agree you are ahead, but the invasion on the left could be annoying. I would have preferred to leave the G12 stone weaker.]
;W[dj]C[GC: This seems like bad shape/overplay to me. I think you handled this well.]
;B[fi]C[GC: Good. Weak point of the shape.];W[fj];B[gj];W[gi]
;B[fh];W[gk];B[ej];W[hj];B[ek]C[AB: Now I clearly thought this game was over.]

Basically, White managed to get some points in the middle due to a number of smaller mistakes by me. But nothing grave happened... Anyway, thanks for your comments!]
