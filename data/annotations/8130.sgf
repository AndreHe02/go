C[Hi, in this game I tried different variations in the review afterwards. Could you please show me the main mistakes? I played black. What do you think about fuseki?

Thank you in advance for reviewing!

Igor];B[qd];W[ed]C[Review by Jadoube:]
(;B[oc]C[J:  3 seems overly territorial. I myself would prefer to take another corner point]
;W[cp];B[pp];W[nq];B[lq];W[no]
(;B[fq]C[J: Black seems to be leaving too many stones open to attack - the corner 7 and 9]
;W[iq];B[jp];W[hp]
(;B[dq];W[cq];B[eo]
(;W[dn]C[J White is making nice territory, so long as the 22 stones on the bottom can get away, which looks unlikely.]
;B[io];W[go];B[gn];W[fn];B[fo];W[hn];B[ho];W[gm];B[gp];W[en]
;B[cd];W[lp];B[kq]
(;W[ko]C[J: White would be better ignoring the bottom and expanding on a larged scale.]
(;B[kp]C[J: 31 seems only to force white to strengthen his position.]
;W[lo];B[in];W[im]
(;B[ec]
(;W[fc]C[White might have reacted differently];B[dc];W[gd];B[df]
;W[ch];B[cj];W[dj];B[di];W[ci];B[ej];W[dk];B[dh];W[cg];B[dg]
;W[ek]
(;B[fj]C[J: Does 51 make any territory? Does it threaten anything? Are the white stones above safe?]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[pn]
(;B[pr]TR[pn][qn][qo]C[J: R3 is a weak point in all this. After 55 its a peep and also a standard move after the marked stones]
(;W[or]
(;B[oq];W[nr];B[qj]C[J: black does not have time for this. The priority is living in the corner.]
;W[qq]
(;B[pq];W[ro]
(;B[rq]TR[qo]C[J:  The whole thing about this corner shape and the 3-3 invasion is the atari on the marked stone]
;W[qp];B[rr];W[qr];B[qs]C[J: The black corner is dead. Take sente to play elsewhere]
;W[rp];B[sq]C[J: aagh. you're dead and give white sente];W[pk]
(;B[fe]C[J: Too small.  White will be happy to lose the one stone and run away with the other stones.]
;W[ge]
(;B[fd]C[J: White was happy for you to play this.];W[ff];B[ee]
(;W[ef];B[dd];W[fb]
(;B[gf]C[J: Again small. Capturing 2 stones in exchane for letting white live on the top is bad. Firstly white makes more territory than the 2 captures. secondly white gets strength from which to reduce the effect of Black's corner.]
;W[hf];B[gg]
(;W[hg]C[J: white is thinking of repeating the forcing moves. a mistake, white should have palyed on the top]
;B[hc];W[gh]
(;B[fg];W[fh];B[eg];W[gc]
(;B[hh]C[J: Again black is making small captures.   Learn to sacrifice stones in exchange for larger objectives.]
;W[jd]
(;B[hi];W[jb]C[J:  White made more pointson the top than black did by the captures.]
(;B[kc]C[J: but after white connects 93 is left against a strong wall. there is nothing useful to be done with it.]
;W[jc];B[ig];W[if];B[jg]C[J: The black wall , if it can be called a wall faces a strong white position. it is gaining nothing. These moves force white to strengthen his position]
;W[kd]
(;B[lc]C[J: again you could consider sacrificing this stone.]
;W[qg]C[How should black attack here?                J; Is black  attacking? Black has the very weak stone at R10 to defend]
(;B[og]C[J: this forces white out the very route most likely to lead to the capture of R10]

Black tends to worry far too much about losing small numbers of stones. Try to think on a broader scale. count. Think about the biggest move, think about places where your opponent would like to play.  Most importantly think about sente and make big moves when you get sente.]
