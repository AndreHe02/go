[jp];W[qo]C[Mi3ke: White's decision to invade right away is suspect.

Better is to take the open top side either with a move around k16 or an  approach at o17 or o16.

The standard way to tackle the 3-4 stone in the chinese formation is with a  light reducing move at p5 to which black responds with a knights move in  either direction.

Chinese and san-ren-sei are alike in that the timing of invasions against  them is critical.  Invade too late and the moyo will be too big, invade too  early and your fate may be even worse, with weak groups running all over the  board and your stones never   able to recover.]
;B[qp]
(;W[ql]C[Mi3ke: r8 is a bad move.
White's basic idea is ok... "ignore the first stone and try to make a light  base."    but....

the problem is that r8 is begging black to play the very move he would *love*  to play but might seem slow normally at r9.  See the shape of black's two  stones.  fall in love with it.  They have 5 liberties to white's 3 and face  outward.  It is called the   iron pillar and is considered excellent as long as it is near a weak white  position.  (In a vacuum it is a little slow).

White should instead do the obvious and play q5 -- or attach at r9  immediately.]
;B[qk];W[po];B[op];W[rk];B[rj];W[rl]
(;B[oo]C[Mi3ke: s4 does more to threaten  white's eyeshape than p5, and is quite big territorially.  There is only so  much development you can get out of k4, and this area is likely to turn into  territory as white runs, anyway, so it isn't impera
tive to cut
 white off like this.

The optimal development of the chinese opening is for black to build  territory on the bottom and thickness on the upper right when white invades.

The key to s4 is eyespace.  go back and look at the variations.  This a  really important.  Second line moves are not slow when they are critical to  the eyespace of two groups.  This is the kind of move that should *jump* out  at you when you are attacking   a weak group like this.]
;W[pl];B[qi]C[jl: B r11 is awful,  should have been at p9. I has also considered B r10 but didn't like it.

Mi3ke:  Well you were correct not to like r10 :-O...  r11 is much better than  that.

But p9 is superior.  remember as long as the r9 stones have 4 liberties or  more and the ladder is good, the clamp at s11 won't work.  And even if it  did, the difference of the hane in this situation is hard to overstate.  Read  the section about the strugg
le to get ahead in Kageyama's "Lessons in the fundamentals of Go" and you may  be enlightened.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[pj];B[qj];W[nj];B[oi];W[nl]C[jl: good result  for W. B p5 has become useless.


Mi3ke: yes and compare this to some of the positions I showed after s4...

I think white is already even on the board without komi.];B[fc];W[jc]C[Mi3ke: this pincer is a mistake.]

(;B[lc]C[
 evan 7k*: b has good thickness in upper right
 evan 7k*: m17 takes advantage of that

Mi3ke:  I disagree with evan here.  a more standard jump and settle would be  fairly effective.  go back to see...

the key is that black's corner is still open.  white can invade in sente.   better to make white play around n17/o17 and let black defend the corner in  sente. like in the jump variation.]

(;W[hc]C[ evan 7k*: i dont like h17. w should jump out instead too  narrow to make a base on the side. by jumping out w could do several things:  set up to reduce b on right, attack the w stone on left, and do all this  while running to safety.
although, h17 is a severe attack on f17

Mi3ke: H17 isn't severe at all.  White has taken two stones to do what he  only needed one for.  If this is his idea why didn't he make the one space  pincer to start with?

Black could just dive to safety at c17 and be happy that white has wasted a  stone.  think tewari... and follow the variation.

Never make two pincers against the same stone from the same direction.

In fact, the jump that jloup played is *even* stronger.  Now white has two  stones to take care of instead of one.]

(;B[fe]C[ evan 7k*: w says  that r17 is huge for him now. agree with him]
;W[df]C[ evan 7k*: but look how now w stones on top are under  attack. f15 is good]

(;B[hd]C[jl: I think that B h16 was bad. I also considered B r17  and B c17. Both would let W control the game by attacking F17. So what should  B have done here?

Mi3ke: if you jump to f15 you are saying that you mean to attack white.   There is a proverb which says "Do not touch what you are trying to attack."   It applies here in spades.

Black should have played d18, wc17, bg18 and let white stew over the  response.  A likely one would be the attachment at m16 which serves to defend  black's corner and turn m17 into a good move.  Actually h17 is what made m17  a good move.  white has essenti

ally pincered himself!

If you don't understand the proverb about not touching what you are  attacking, a good thing to hear is Bruce Wilcox's instant go lecture on  contact fights.

In general contact fights tend to strengthen stones approx. equally.  But  when you are strong you prefer to press the advantage!  Make contact where  you are weak, play thickly and at a small distance where you are strong.

go back to see the sequence.];W[id];B[he]C[ evan 7k*: b now has good, thick shape, but  also at the expense of giving w better shape too

Mi3ke: White's shape is much better than black's...  and it should be worse.   consider the white play at e17]

(;W[ie]C[ evan 7k*: b must h14. too  big to allow w to hane at the head of two stones

Mi3ke:  evan is correct. I would even hane at j14.  later black will have  this same opportunity but need to play f13 first.  Here white is still weak,  and black can get away with doing it right off.]

(;B[le]C[jl: B m15  left the corner open at r17, but B r17 again seemed too passive.

Mi3ke:  r17 *was* too passive.  The key with playing the star point is  playing in such a way that leaving the corner open is good.  You must defend  it obliquely.  the worst possible play is to  build two walls facing the star  point that are only a few poi

nts away.    You can only block in one direction, so don't play lots of stones on both  sides until the corner is secure.  One extension is ok, but a jump like m15  practically begs white to take the corner.  As soon as he does, either m15 or  the thickness on the right   are going to look stupid and overconcentrated.

Evan is correct however.  The hane is critical.

You should have played h14 or j14 as my variation shows.];W[qc]C[  evan 7k*: well timed]
;B[qd];W[pc]C[ evan 7k*: b just p17. simple.]
(;B[rc]C[ evan 7k*: in general, when your opponent has two  extensions from a star point, then it is time to invade at the 3-3

jl: W keeps sente with the normal joseki at B 17 so I played s17 with the  intent of letting w live on top but in gote. I needed sente to continue the  attack on the k17 group. Unfortunately, the sequence starting with S17 ended  up in gote for B, with disas

trous consequences.


Mi3ke:  You can get sente with p17 too...  The key is not sente/gote but the  direction.  the big fight is over in the middle of the top where there are  two weak groups.  By invading black's stronghold, white has given *you* the  chance to dictate the direc
tion. Use it to get *your* stones in the important area instead of pushing  his over there.]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[oc];B[od]C[jl: B o15 might have been better than p16

Mi3ke:  SOOHADOTO...

Evan had it right.  p17 is more important than s17.  If white gets too far  over on the top he can use it to help his j16 group which is still attackable.]
;W[nd]C[ evan 7k*: t18 is important

Mi3ke:  ooh. white mistake.  o17 is good enough.  you can win the game at a  stroke, if you play carefully.]
;B[nc]C[jl: I had read that B o17  could capture the corner. But in retrospect, B n16, n17 or n18 might have  been better to keep sente and c
ontinue the attack against k17.

Mi3ke:  you were right here. o16 is an overplay and this is how you punish  it.  the corner is big enough to be worth gote if you do it right.]
;W[mc];B[nb]C[ evan 7k*: w o16 stone is doomed. b can either n16  cut, or n18 connect under]
;W[md]C[ evan 7k*: there fore: w corner is in danger! b now must  n18. fight in corner is urgent! life and death of group is at stake]
;B[mb];W[ld]C[ evan 7k*: yes. interesting. what does b do  now? it is a race to kill the corner


Mi3ke: How about squeezing with l16!!!  Black makes a beautiful wall , gives  white bad shape and *still* kills the corner.  and it's a forced walk.   white's other choices are far worse.]

(;B[kc];W[kd]C[ evan  7k*: k18. think b can now kill the w conrner. he is getting extra liberties  at least if not making living shape. kill the corner as follows: t18 or r19.]
;B[pb]C[ evan 7k*: q18 is good. w cannot p18 or b r18
. w is just dead now in corner

jl: B p18 would be better than q18 since it would save the L17 stones (q18  allows a W cut at M18 as the game showed). B has killed the W invasion, but  in gote unfortunately, so W can now strongly attack the F17 group.

Mi3ke:  another thing to look at is how that m15 stone looks...  The key  reason this is bad is not the gote as much as how much white is strengthened.   He has many liberties and is out in the open.  that is what weakens black's  stones more than anything.    In the squeeze variation white's group is weaker and the black thickness is  closer to the h15 stones, making the fight there much easier to handle.]
;W[db]C[ evan 7k*: i like the hane at h14 for w. d18 is also good,  it attacks the f17 group. h3  is also a big pt for w.

jl: I think that W is leading now because the f17 group will be a burden for  B for the rest of the game.]
;B[gc];W[hb]C[evan 7k*: i  would say c3 is premature now, but not premature for b if w h3. then the  double extension, invade rules a
pply. w is not attacking b group at top. but he should not expect to kill it,  just attack it, harass it and build thickness for hi
mself, or territory on the left side while attacking

jl: evan is correct; I had also predicted the same sad outcome for B, but  could not see any alternative. The f17 group seemed too large to sacrifice  now.

evan 7k*: b should either h3, or g12 to jump out

jl: b h3 would be much too small because the f17 group would likely die.


Mi3ke:  I kind of like the idea of probing at d15, and looking for some kind  of trade.  the g17 stones look oh, so very heavy.

j14 also helps to settle the shape, if you don't want to trade.   Upon reflection I think that your move at f13 is actually the best!  But you  have to follow it up.]

(;B[fg]C[jl: I also considered g12, but I was  afraid that W would make even more territory on the left side. In retrospect,  g12 would have been better because it goes faster into the open.

Mi3ke:  Nope.  f13 is good shape.  it needs to be followed up at the proper  time by j14!  although g12 works ok that way too.  f13 is more likely to be  answered, as it puts more pressure on the invasion at d12.]
;W[lb]C[jl: nice tesuji. B cannot  do L18 because of shortage of liberties after W p18]
;B[qb];W[dh]C[ evan 7k*: not sure why b let go of l17 stones. guess it is small  now

jl: I had no choice!

evan 7k*: d12 is exactly what i whas talking about, build terr while  attacking weak group, upper left is Huge. nice invasion for b would be b10.  but, he cant afford it now as f13 still a little weak. afraid b need another  move there. around j14, etc

jl: evan is again correct here. This confirms that f13 was too slow.

Mi3ke: Actually I like f13.  Watch what happens when black plays j14 after  the f13 for d12 exchange.  the problem black is facing here happened way  before f13...   your group got weak back when he failed to establish a base  by sliding into the corner at d

18 way back when.  It then got weaker when you failed to see the squeeze line  of play and gave white even more strength.  f13 was not the problem.]

(;B[fi]C[ evan 7k*: this is shockingly gote though. ok. b is now out in the  safe

Mi3ke:  j14 is a much better way to get out.];W[fk]C[ evan 7k*:  but f11 does littel other than defend. good for w! f9 builds moyo while  attacking. see the principle?
multipurpose moves

Mi3ke:  f11 doesn't even defend very well.  black is in the open and unlikely  to die, but there is still some mischief that white could concoct here.  Plus  it induces f9 which is orders of magnitude better than what white would get  if black had played j14

 instead of f11.]
(;B[cp]C[jl: My f17 group isn't completely safe  yet, but I couldn't afford to defend once more so I had to invade. I  hesitated with B c6 which might have been better.

 evan 7k*: w should c5. just allow b to live small in corner

Mi3ke: I agree that c6 is the right move for black.  It will be sacrificed  but will give black a good leg into the left side. go back for variation.]
;W[cq]C[Mi3ke: c5 is amuch better move for white.  f9 says, "I am  going to make the side big"  Once you have done that, you *want* the side,  not the corner!]

Mi3ke: which is why white should be busy *splitting* them!  with a move like  h9.  h4 is lukewarm, only attacking one group and not having much effect on  l4 either.]

(;W[hp];B[ej]C[Mi3ke: You nailed it here.  push  and cut.  Had white played h9 this wouldn't work as well since his cutting  stones would be stronger.]

;W[di]C[ evan 7k*: d11 protects c10 cut. n9? j14? notice how these  moves far away

Mi3ke:  c11 is the proper move, leaving a better endgame situation for white.   b8 will now promise the clamp as a followup., something that would not work  if white played c11 here instead.  study that shape that c11 gives white, it  is the key to many good

 moves that are hard for the novice to see.]
(;B[hk]C[jl: B h9 might be an overplay. What should have B played  here?

Mi3ke: I prefer g9.  If you  are willing to sacrifice e10 to maintain the   connection, you can't really go wrong.  back for variation.

you can't necessarily keep the connection but you get a more playable game  than with h9.]
;W[gj]C[ evan 7k*: h9 is an example of a classic  attacking move, a cap. g11 is the typical dodge. diagonal move to escape]

;B[ig]C[jl: I thought that B j13 would ensure the life of my top  group. I had not seen W g14.

Mi3ke:  g14 doesn't work.  I believe your group is alive.

;W[kg];B[gq]C[jl: B g3 is the losing move. I was under  such time pressure (only a few seconds left) that I could not check if my top  group was alive.

 evan 7k*: agree, hobbes. i like w c5 better. then w left is even bigger!

Mi3ke:  white c5 instead of c3 would have won the game.  After c3 it was  still close.    j14 would have made black live, and given black a slight advantage.    even f14 doesn't kill black, though it is not as good as j14.

g3 was actually an *excellent* move.  I might have played something lukewarm  like j3 or h3... but this is *much* better.

jl: B is still dead with B j14 (see variation B). The correct move here is B  e16, which makes B alive (see variation C).

Because you play p17, white center group is still weak and he can't  afford to attack like that lest you hane at j14 and take control of the  center while attacking the j15  stones.

It is worth losing a few points in the corner to get this.  (though white's  play at o17 makes the game even better for you than this variation....)]
