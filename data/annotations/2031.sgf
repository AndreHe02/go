AB[pd][dp]C[Jeff -- I'm playing white and am a 13k player on KGS
runski - Black lost because he tried to kill white's group at the center.  Instead of going for all or nothing, black could simply take profit during the attack and he could easily win the game.]
;W[qp]C[Angalot [15k\]: and hello from Belgrade. <bonk>];B[cd]
;W[ec];B[hd];W[ee]C[Jeff -- Is the two space jump appropriate with the two space pincer? I wasn't sure, so I went with the once space jump.
runski - It's more common to do a two space jump against a two space pincer.  However, one space jump is still a joseki move.]
;B[df]
(;W[cb]LB[cc:A]C[Jeff -- should I have counterattacked at k16 instead? Or elsewhere?
runski - A is a joseki move.  Please see the variation.  The game move allows black to take a bigger corner.]
;B[bc];W[hb];B[fd]
(;W[de]LB[ed:A]C[runski - This is aji-keshi.  Simply connect at A.  Later white can aim to attack black as shown in the variation.]
;B[ce];W[dc];B[gb];W[gc]
(;B[fc]LB[hc:A]C[runski - Black should cut at A.  Please see variation.]
;W[fb];B[hc];W[ga];B[eb]C[runski - This move isn't a threat.]
;W[db]C[runski - White's move isn't necessary either.];B[gd]
;W[gb];B[ci]TR[da][ea][fa][eb][ad][bd][ae][be][af][bf][ag][bg]
[ah][bh]C[runski - The upper left corner sequence comes to an end.  Although black plays an extra move, the outcome is good for black.  Black makes about 10 points on the left white while white makes only 4 points.  In addition white's position is low while black has more thickness.]
;W[oq]LB[fq:A]C[Jeff -- Would it have been bigger to approach one of the corners instead?
runski - This is good.  A 4-3 point corner enclosure is very big.  The choice of moves reflects a player's preference.  By playing the game move, white stakes out solid terrority on the lower right, giving black a chace to build a moyo on the left or on the top.  If white doesn't want black to build a moyo, he can approach at A instead.]
;B[jp]LB[oj:B][qj:A][jo:D][jq:C]C[runski - In general a move around A is bigger.  If white gets to play A, then he jump to B later to form a so-called 3-dimensional moyo.  Looking at the situation in another way, after white makes a corner enclosre an extension around A is bigger than an extension around C.  An extension at A followed by B is 3-dimensional, while an extension at C followed by D looks flat.]
;W[qj]LB[oj:B][pk:A]TR[df][ci][dp][jp]C[Jeff -- I also thought about playing on the fourth line. Would that have been appropriate?
runski - Both 3rd and 4th line extensions are fine in general, but which one is better usually depends on the whole board position.  Since black has the potential to build a big moyo on the left side (marked stones), it is likely white has to play some moves to reduce it.  An invasion or reduction would lead to an attack by black and white probably has to run to the center to escape.  If the game move is on the 4th line, it can serve as an ally for the escaping group.  With the game move, black can play a shoulder hit at A or a cap a B to block white's connection.]
;B[qg];W[nc]LB[jc:B][pc:C][cn:A]TR[hb]SQ[pd][qg]C[runski - The upper side is small because of the white's marked stone.  White can always jump out to B to dash black's hope to make terrority in that area.  An approach move at A would cut down black's chance of forming a moyo.  Even if white insists on playing in this area, he should play C.  A rule of thumb: if black has a star-point corner enclosure, it's generally better to play C.  Please see the variation to find out how black can take advantage of white's mistake.]

(;B[lc]LB[oc:A]TR[hb]C[runski - As described in the previous move, this is the wrong direction.  Black can't expect to make much terrority here because of white's marked stone.  Play A instead.]

(;W[qc]LB[pc:A]C[Jeff -- I knew this move would make him thick, but I didn't see that I had much choice. And since he was open on the left, I figured I could reduce that later.
runski - I agree that playing 3-3 point gives thickness to black.  Playing A is an option.  Please see variation.]
;B[pc]C[JMiller [13k\]: You're always welcome at the Boston Go club]
;W[pb]C[Angalot [15k\]: it's a long journey to Boston... as a matter of fact, maybe next year I'll come to Philadelphia, so, who knows? :)))]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[qe];W[rf];B[rg]C[Angalot [15k\]: ... all I know about Boston is the Celtics. :)]
;W[dn]LB[fp:A]C[Jeff -- I chose the high approach because my position overall is low.
runski - A high approach move against a star point should only be used in special situations.  After black responds at A, white doesn't have a good follow-up move.]
;B[dl]LB[fp:A][fq:B]C[JMiller [13k\]: They haven't been playing so well lately. But the football team, the Patriots, now there's a good story.
runski - A is better.  Now white can play A or B for an exchange.]
;W[cp]LB[el:D][cn:A][fp:B][fq:C]TR[dn]SQ[ci][dl]C[Jeff -- Is there a better move?
runski - If you play the approach move at A, you can see that it relates better to the game move.  With the high approach move, there are cutting points.  Answering your question, I believe B or C is better.  Your marked stone isn't dead yet.  There is aji, such as attaching at D.  You don't have to worry about making black thick, because his two marked stones are close together.]
;B[dq]LB[cq:A]C[runski - A is the only move.];W[cq];B[cr];W[br]
C[Angalot [15k\]: I'm sure it will, USA is a big land]
(;B[mq]LB[dr:A]C[runski:  Play A to finish the corner sequence.  It's sente.  Please see variation.]
;W[oo];B[ql]TR[oo][mq]C[runski - If black plans to invade, don't make the marked stones exchange.  With the white marked stone, it puts more pressure on the black's invading stone.]
;W[pk];B[om]
(;W[pl]LB[qn:A]C[runski - Play A to destroy black's shape.  Please see variation.]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[qn];W[rm];B[rn];W[rl];B[po];W[pp];B[mn]C[runski - Please note white's corner is much smaller compared to the variation.]
;W[rp];B[cn]LB[dr:A]C[runski - Play A to take away white's eyespace first.]
;W[co];B[en];W[cm];B[dm];W[do];B[cl];W[bm];B[eo]LB[ep:A]C[Jeff -- I think I got lucky with that sequence. It seems black could have really done a lot of damage to white.
runski - Actually this result is quite good for black.  He has built a wall, although the cut at A is problematic.]

(;W[dr]LB[ep:A]C[runski - Cut at A instead.  If black wants to save his stones, white can reduce black's moyo.  Please see variation.]
;B[er];W[cs];B[eq];W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[no];W[on];B[mo];W[ml]
;B[nk]LB[km:A]C[runski - Exploit the aji of the black stones later.  Play A to expand the moyo.]
;W[nl];B[ok];W[ol];B[oi];W[ph]C[Jeff -- In hindsight, this play seems unreasonable.  Instead, It hink I should have jumped out to k8 or nearby.
runski - Yes, a move around k7 or k8 is better.];B[pi];W[qi]

;W[fp]LB[nr:A]C[Jeff -- Was this a bad move? I think now that I had better plays at b18 and k 19?
runski - A is big, a double sente move.];B[fo];W[fm];B[fk]LB[gk:A]
