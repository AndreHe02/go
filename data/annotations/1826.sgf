;B[dp];W[qp];B[dc];W[pc];B[ci];W[qe];B[jd]C[hv2go: good move (I think) as it is an   extension for white as well as for   black.
bink: right. It also fits well with your chinese opening on the left.]
;W[de];B[fd];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[bb];W[cg]MA[op][ei][jq][ff]
C[hv2go : standard joseki.

the four marked points were on my   mind for the next move.

E11 / F14 / K3 / P4
bink:
right now E11 is best. This is the idea of the chinese opening: you attack  the white stones. Thereby you build a moyo on the lower left and some territory on the upper side.  Your move at F14 is the wrong direction. because of the white stones  Q17 and R15 you cannot expect a moyo on the upper side. You will see later, how bad it turned out that you didnt play E11.
with E11 you drive the white stones towards the right. With F14 you drive the white stones  towards your moyo.]
;B[ff]C[White should try to get out with D11 (or E13 or E12)]
;W[dd];B[ec];W[bc];B[op]C[bink: An alternative would have been: Black B12, white B13, black E12.
That sequence is very good:  -you keep white enclosed and your stones connected.  -You punish white for the weak move B17
- it might even be that white is frightened into answering one more time at B15. I dont think the white stones would really die if white ommited B15, but that is hard to calculate.


On the other side: P4 is a rather urgent point.];W[oq];B[nq]
;W[pq];B[mp];W[qn];B[iq]C[hv2go : I thought this exchange was   good for black. I expected a pincer.
bink: It is not so good for black. Now you have got two third-line extensions from your star point D4. That is the ideal moment for white to invade.  With a black stone at E11 your position would be splendid.]
;W[cq]C[hv2go : this is a welcome invasion.   Too early in my opinio. It gives me a   chance to make a wall.

bink: I disagree. For black it will be hard now to make profit from his framework.
It is shallow and now it is also hollow.];B[cp]C[hv2go : blocked at the correct side ?
bink: this is really hard to tell now. Neither side is really ideal.
With a stone at E11 that block C4 would be the right one.  Here I think I would rather play D3. because the extension towards O3 is larger.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn];W[fr];B[gq]
;W[mc]C[bink: Strangely enough white gives you the chance to play E11 now (or E12, or the sequence B12,B13, E12). That would still give you some kind of moyo.]
;B[om]MA[jj][ik][fi]C[hv2go : am I too greedy here ?? This   looks like a very big moyo. Should I   have played at any of the marked   points ?

F11 / I9 / K10
bink: This move does not make good use of your wall.
Your wall wants another stone at E11 or E12 or if you prefer: F11.

Just the lower part of your moyo looks rather like a drawer  (it would be better if it looked like a box). It is still open towards  the center. and has this gap at E12 to worry about. (It would be much bigger  if the moyo would go down to the first line. But there is F2 peeping in.)

Still: you got all the central influence. Your position is still ok.]
;W[hl]MA[gm][im][fl]C[hv2go : now I am in trouble. No idea   what to do. !!   G7 seems too small, maybe I7 ? and   build territory at the right hand side ?

F8 and get territory at the left side ?

bink: Right: G7 is to small (because of the drawer shape of your moyo).
This is a hard decision. You cannot expect to kill white, and it is hard to see, where you can make territory by attacking. you want to drive white towards your strong positions.  After all I think H10 is correct.]
;B[hj]LB[cg:14]C[hv2go: I chose this move, thinking I   could build new territory at the top and   press whites stone against my wall.

I was at this point aware that move 14   (C13) might give me trouble later on.   I would have to shut that gap asap.
bink: Unfortunately there might not be so much territory at the top (F row to K row is just not wide enough).
Still: you build more central power, and this will be useful later.]
;W[ij];B[ii];W[jj]C[bink: You should not make living to easy for white. You should play H9 now.
If white plays H9, white gets good form. (Black H9 would be a form move. In that case it denies white good form).
The expected sequence: Black H9, white J8, black G8. This way, white remains fragil and you get some territory at the left.]
;B[ji];W[kj]C[still: Black H9];B[ki];W[hk];B[gj];W[lm];B[ko]
;W[jm];B[fl];W[hn]C[bink: This is a rather weak white move. This is a rather cold area.  Neither player will make profit here. The most urgent points are at M10 and M11.
Whoever plays there first will get an advantage.
This is quite a common situation: Picture the two rows of stones: J11-L11 and J10-L10.
Whoever bents with a hane around the corner first gets the advantage.   I will give two variations as examples.]

(;B[fn]MA[pj][lc][mi]C[hv2go: the marked points were the   other moves which I considered. Are   they better ?

M17 / N11 / Q10

bink: F6 is very small. I am rather sure: Every strong player would not hesitate to play M10 now. In addition with what I said in my last comment: after M10 the three white stones  have only three liberties left. White has to worry about your threat to play L9 in the future.

M17 is certainly big, but it is an endgame move. N11 is the right direction but a little slow.
Q10 is ok. The right side is going to be the focus of the game soon.]

(;W[le];B[jf]C[bink: Whites move M15 means: you are not getting much territory in the square
row 11-16,collum F-M. Your move K14 is not worth so much. You should play somewhere else. E.g. L18 is much bigger.  If you watch your last two moves: F6 in answer to H6, and now K14 in answer to M15:
This is not a good style of playing: White reduces your area, you answer directly to keep as much as possible. This way, white is dictating the game. It is better to answer elsewhere: Black makes a big move (M15) you make a big move elsewhere (e.g. B12 which is sente or L18 which is gote. Or M10 - the urgent point.)]
;W[jb];B[jc];W[kb];B[ib];W[qj]C[hv2go: at this point I thought white had   won the game. Every move I would   make, would give him a chance to   enlarge his territory.
bink:
white has 10+15 points in the lower corners, about 25 points in the upper right corner.
Together withe the center and the left side white has 60 points plus possibilities on the right side.
black has 55 points on the left side and about 15 points on the lower side. If you manage to keep the right hand side small (and manage to get a big point like B12 in sente) you still have chances. But you are right: White has the lead.]
;B[mi]C[hv2go : maybe this would reduce a bit   of his territory.
bink: It is a little slow. You will play M10 at the next move anyway. Why not play it imediatly? Are you afraid of the white cut at M11?
Black M10, White M11, Black L9, White K8, Black M9. This indeed leads to a fight. It is not clear who wins this fight (though in my eyes Black has a clear advantage). But White should never risk starting this fight: White leads anyway, and white risks to loose his central group.  So after your M10: firstly, probably you dont have to face Black M11; secondly, you would
welcome M11, as it gives you a chance to win the match.
If you are behind: Do not avoid fights!];W[mk];B[lj];W[lk];B[oh]
;W[of]C[White should play R12! The right side is far more important. White does not need to fear that black would play P14: Black P14 would be absolutely Gote, so white could make territory elsewhere in exchange.]
;B[ok];W[jl]MA[eh][dh][ph]C[hv2go: I did not think this was a good   move. Not necesarry. The marked   points were better in my opinion.   Correct ??

D12 / E12 / Q12
bink: correct. There is another big point: B12. B12 might not look big, but B12 is "double sente". Whoever plays there, the other player will likely answer. Those "double sente" points are pure profit, and should be played very early. In this case B12 is your "right". White has to answer at B13, otherwise white looses the group. You are not really forced to answer if white plays B12.]
;B[dh]C[hv2go : defensive move. was afraid to   let white get in there.
bink: it is a huge Gote move. But you have to play B12 first! Now white will clearly play B12. Do not only think of securing territory, think also about attack!   The correct sequence: Black B12, white B13, Black D12 is about 6 points better then the one you played. 6 points could easily decide the game. (which 6 points? After the played sequence white has A13,B13 as his territory, which he would not have after the correct sequence. after the correct seqeunce you have B11, A11,B10, A10 as your territory, which you dont have in the game).

Do not be afraid that after Black B12 white would push through with D12: you would just continue with B14 and kill the white group, which has nowhere to run.

Watch out for those "double sente points"];W[bh];B[bi];W[dg]
;B[eg];W[eh]C[bink: strange move!];B[ch];W[bg];B[fh]C[bink: I am rather sure you could have played elsewhere (R12). Was white threatening anything with his lonely stone? I dont see any threat. If you dont see a threat either:  risk it! play elsewhere next time! Especially when you are behind. I miss the fighting in your game. Go is also about fighting. You also have to develop good fighting skills, if you want to become stronger.]
;W[ef];B[fg];W[be]C[bink: Again, I dont think that was necessary. Both of you play rather coutious]
;B[pg]C[bink: Play R12, the 1 point jump. It is big if you manage to make a "touch down" on the right side. Also it threatens the stone R10.]
;W[pf]C[bink: A very very weak move by White: Is he afraid of Q14? That is nothing. The stones R15 and P14 are already "connected" with the knight move. There is no stone missing. a wasted move. White should have played S13 avoiding the touch down.]

(;B[qg]MA[ql][rg]C[hv2go :  is a move at the marked   points better ?  R8 / S13

bink: your move and S13 are equally good. R8 would have been far better.  I would even say: R8 would have won the game. White would probably be barely able to safe his stone R10. See variation.]
;W[pl];B[ol]C[bink: Here starts the endgame. There is no attackable group anywhere. Now one should always play the biggest endgame move.]
;W[pm];B[nj]C[bink: That is a wasted move. You wanted to connect your three stones P9-P7 to the stones above. But if white cuts, you can still connect them below with O6. The points O10 and O6 are miai. O10 is on a neutral point!
Avoiding such wasteful moves will increase your strength by 2-3 stones.
G2 is the biggest Gote now. S14 is a big sente.];W[gr]C[White J1 looks much bigger to me. Well - It might be to risky for white, who leads anyway.]
;B[hr];W[jo];B[jp];W[kn];B[lo];W[go]C[bink: Please ignore moves like that! White has no follow-up threat!  The safest way to loose in the endgame is: answer every move of your oponent which vaguely looks like a sente move.
Good black moves: sente: S14, Gote: P2, reverse sente: K19.]
;B[fo];W[ia];B[hb];W[ha];B[ga];W[ja];B[fb];W[kf];B[jg];W[io]
;B[ld];W[md];B[lc];W[lb]C[hv2go : I was pleased that I thought of   this sequence, it is a slight reduction   and I have sente.
bink: that is right. probably you should continue with L15 (after S14 sente). There are not many big endgame moves left, so L15 would be sente as well. Whites lead is not big!
You could still win the game with a good endgame.];B[nr];W[or]
;B[pp];W[qq];B[ri];W[rj];B[qi]C[bink: first S14 sente. watch out for those points!]
;W[ip];B[jq];W[gm];B[fm];W[rf]C[bink: white gets S14! you should feel a big pain in such a moment! S14 was clearly your sente. You can ignore well S14 (well: now there are no really big points left, so: after some sente moves like T10 and L15 you might well come back to S13. Having said that: e.g. A17 is a bigger Gote for you then S13.)]
;B[rg];W[mg];B[pj];W[qk];B[pn]C[hv2go : this was a terrible move !!, but   I hoped to create cutting points, but   misread completely.]
;W[po];B[on];W[oo];B[np];W[je];B[ie];W[ke];B[no];W[qo];B[pk]
;W[rl];B[sf]MA[id]C[hv2go : now I should have defended at   the marked point instead of the move I   made.  I16
bink: I dont see a big threat at J16 at the moment.
The biggest Gote are: A17 and G1. The biggest reverse sente is L13.]
;W[se];B[sg];W[kg]C[bink: Ok, that is now a white sente. because: both cuts J16 and J14 threaten something.
I think the best black answer is L12.];B[ng];W[nf];B[mh];W[if]

(;B[jh]C[h2go : was this the best defensive move   ???
bink: I think so. Maybe L12 would have been one point better, but looks much more unstable.  The other option (Black H15, allowing white K12) is -according to my computation- one point worse for you. See variation]
;W[id];B[he];W[kd];B[ic];W[ge];B[fe]C[bink: Good! Whites last move was a wasted move (-1 point in sente)]
;W[gk];B[fk];W[ai]C[bink: Good! White plays the big sente moves, before playing the big gote at L17.]
;B[aj];W[ah];B[bk];W[kc];B[rd];W[re]C[hv2go : with the following sequence I   hoped to make a small group or catch   some stones.
bink: My count before S16: white 89.5 to black 83 (this is not exact to the point, but should be rather close to the reality). So even now: a good endgame (and a poor one by white) would still give you the win.  There are still two moves which are worth more then 2 points: A18 and G1.
A18 is Gote. But it means: you will get the points at A19,B19 and D18 as your territory (which you dont get if black plays there. and you deny white the point A16 (as  Black A 17 becomes your right.) It is a 4 point move.
How about Black G1? If white answers all is fine. If white does not answer, you might be able to reduce the white corner even more.  G1 has one more advantage: At the moment white O1 is sente. but it stops being sente if you get a stone at H1.  So maybe you still had some chances? If S16 doesnt work, you give away exactly one point.
(Namely: you could have played R14 in Sente, reducing the area by one point).
I give you a variation with a good endgame on both sides. In that example White wins by 3.5 points. So it is really close.]
