C[Hi I am Chris,

my comment will be prefixed as such.

Chris: Looking over the game, you played well until the middle-game progressed. The main pointers here would be:

1.) How much thickness you have depends on the surroundings.
2.) Avoid fights, rather than try to win locally.
3.) Attack when terretory can be gained, not when the surround is played out already (typical KGS helicopter style)

In order to become stronger now, you need to remove overplays/unnecessary danger.

;W[pf];B[og];W[pi];B[hd]C[I tried to calculate how much to extend here.  A two space extension from one stone at P16 would be M16.  Then add an extra space for each stone in my thickness, would put me at G16, so I chose one less, and on the 4th line.   How would your thinking process be here?

Chris: The rule of thumb "wallheight plus one" stops taking effect with more than 3 stones. This rule was devised so that its easy to remember which shapes are uncuttable by invasion. With thickness like this, you should ask yourself, if White invades, will i feel comfortable attacking him?]
;W[ob];B[nb];W[pb]
(;B[mc]C[Chris:  This is the first bad move. There are no cutting points in the wall, no need to protect this one. There are much bigger and more urgent things about. It is probably not even honte because of the great thickenss Black has built.]

(;B[pk]TR[ji][li][mi]LB[pk:39]C[Chris: This exchange was good for black. With thickness you need to attack. This White group gives you the chance to. B39 is overplay though, as Whites group is alive, there is no need to play here.

The thinking process should be, White is strong, I need to lean on him to make the Black group strong as well, to be able to attack freely.]
;W[ol];B[pl];W[om];B[pm];W[on];B[po];W[oj]TR[mj][mk][ml][mi]
[li][ji]C[Chris: This sequence contradicts Blacks earlier strategy of building thickness. The marked stones have become so weak; Whites group feels no pressure anymore.
Since Black got some cash though, it is not the end of the world.]
;B[kj];W[ki];B[jk];W[hi];B[hk];W[fi];B[jp];W[mn]LB[jd:A]C[I would say that this is small because he is playing close to his stones that are already alive.

Chris: I agree, as White I would have played A.];B[jn];W[qq]
;B[pq];W[rp]C[This seems to live, too easily.  Should I  be able to kill this stone?

Chris: No unfortunately not, since all stones were on the 4th line, it is unreasonable to expect this to die.]
;B[rn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[ro];W[sr];B[nq]LB[dq:A]
[ci:B]C[Chris: Again Black mechanically protects this useless cut. There is little to be gained. Tenuki to get another big point like A or B.]

[hi]C[hard to believe that he can play so close to my thickness, but I do begin to feel pressured, and lose the thickness.

Chris: You seem to miss the point that White also has thickness. I was waiting for this move. It seems like Black neglects his own safety too much. When the marked stones were weak, the thickness worked well. After they got strong, the thickness lost most value. If you compare the strength of the White group to the Black wall, you must agree, that Black is only slightly stronger.
The mistake was in not attacking the marked stones but rather take terretory on the right. Even though it was maybe not completely obvious back then, now it should be clear.]

(;B[kk]C[Chris: Trying so save a single stone is greedy. You included many liberty race variations which are pretty useless. Not because they are wrong, your tactical analysis was surely correct. But if you get yourself into a situation where you *have* to fight like crazy, then something *beforehand* something strategic went wrong. Maybe you should try to concentrate more playing superior not winning tactical encounters, that were unnecessary.]

;W[ch];B[dh];W[cg];B[dg];W[cf];B[fn]C[My chance to kill

Chris: This typical bad style KGS greedy overplay. You *should* have attacked earlier, when you could *gain from attacking*. In order to attack White so hard, you lose alot of cash, and as you discovered yourself later, could have ben killed. Again though, the problems arise earlier, as pointed out.]
