C[Hi!  Thanks for reviewing my game in advance.  I have not played in ages due to college and tax season.  Anyways, I am getting back into it and figured a review would be helpful.

Reviewer: Hello, all my comments are marked with a R: before them
For any problem or question you can find me on KGS as Wiles
I hope this review will help you improve your Go :)];B[pp];W[dc]

(;B[fg];W[cj]C[R: the last exchange was good for White,
black has given territory to white at the top, so he should recover by attacking the white stone, but after the last exchange white is settled too easily]
;B[cl]
(;W[cd];B[be]C[R: better to not make this exchange since it weakens your two stones on the side]
;W[bd];B[dd];W[cc]
(;B[dk]C[I thought this was a bit overagressive by black.  With only one group to worry about I should be able to make life easily.

R: Yes it is easy to make life, but black has to attack this group to make use of the thickness he has.
Because of this it was better to avoid the C16-B15 exchange, anyway i would have attacked in a different way (see variation)]
;W[ei];B[co];W[ep];B[eo];W[fp];B[fo];W[gi];B[hg];W[go]C[Perhaps G4 was better?

;W[lq];B[lr];W[mr];B[kr];W[mo]C[Was this completely wrong?  I thought there was no way for the L5 stone to survive (at least not with out painful consequences).

R: right, moving out with M6 was unreasonable for Black];B[kn]

(;W[mm]C[R: After this move you got a good squeeze but lost the stones in the center, this was good for black because also his stones at the bottom are not secure (see variations)]

;B[nf];W[mc];B[nd];W[md];B[nc]C[Two big walls.  Instead of O17 I thought black would threaten the R9 group.  Here I think I should have helped it rather then what I (make territory with the wall).]
;W[id];B[kd]TW[mp][nq][oq][nr]C[That seems a bit optimistic ----- I am not that bad at life and death  :-) !

R: Yes, this is obviously unreasonable and you demonstrated that in the game :)

Looking at the final score we can even say that black lost the game here, since it is very close and there are no major mistakes in the following moves.

The main point of the game is that both B and W were unable to attack the opponent properly when they had the possiblity (black against the top left W group, white against the bottom right corner) and the game ended up being very close.
One important thing in Go is to grasp the opportunity when it presents itself :)
