;W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jq]LB[kq:A]C[Az: Can also be at 'a', people sometimes play that way since it works better with the LR corner.]
;W[nc];B[ne]LB[pj:A]C[Az: This is a bizzare and unwarranted move. If you already have a stone around 'a' then I could see it, but this is building a wall towards nothing. I don't see any way to spin this as a good move.]
;W[ld]
(;B[pc];W[qh]TR[ne][pd][pc]C[Later I figured this isn't a good shape :)

Az: Why would it look like one in the first place??]
(;B[qj]C[Az: This is strange since the corner is open and has bad shape.]
;W[qe]
(;B[oq]C[Was enclosing the corner too much or the top is more urgent but how should I play?

Az: This is not the direction of play at all, see var. Remember, "Urgent before big".]
;W[oh];B[mg]LB[mf:A]C[Az: Thin shape, though it is hard to find good shape here on short notice. Kosumi is probably better.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[oj];B[pj];W[ok];B[pl];W[ol];B[pm];W[ri];B[rj]
LB[oe:A]C[Az: Not urgent. White is already very secure here, blocking doesn't have much effect on him. Preventing the cut at 'a' is whats important right now.]

;W[ii];B[hi]C[Az: This looks like an overplay to me, if white cuts I think you're in more trouble than he is.]
;W[hj];B[gj];W[gi];B[hh];W[hk];B[fj];W[fh]C[Az: Hard for B now with two floating groups, since all of the w stones are pretty secure. It's hard to attack the middle directly, its just too strong.]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[kl];W[lk];B[jl];W[ij];B[fg];W[eh];B[gl]C[Az: What is the purpose of this move? These two stones are not all important cutting stones, and white is nearly alive. Black starts a very difficult fight here, but its not clear how she'll profit from it.]

(;B[ch]C[Az: Yes, extending is better than game, but the question I keep asking myself is still "why is black in this fight?".]

;W[cd];B[bf];W[bd];B[fd]C[Az: Did you read out the L&D carefully before tenuki here? I read seki - which would be good enough - but it does not seem obvious.]

;B[mb];W[mc];B[ob];W[nb];B[fi];W[nq];B[op]C[I always just nobi here.

Az: You don't have to always play that way, but there is nothing at all wrong with it here. Helps fix up some aji on the RHS.]
;W[kq];B[jp]TR[nq][kq]LB[mn:A]C[I wonder if I can punish/capture these stones but I was also in time pressure at the time. I really failed and lost a lot of points.

No further comments here but if you would like to give me more tips, thank you.

Az: If you had a stone around 'a' or something then capturing could be reasonable, but as it stands there are a whole lot of thick white stones up there. W can just connect up - or threaten to connect up - to fix his shape. In short, this area here wasn't your territory in the same way that the LR was your territory.]
;W[ko]LB[kp:A]C[Az: You should push through, w's shape becomes very strong if you don't. Just because he's going to live here doesn't mean it has to be a disaster like it was in game. If black let white escape smaller it might still be a game, this was where it became a sure loss. If w just connects out without a huge loss for you its still a game, but the loss here was too big.
