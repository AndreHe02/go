Hi,

In
this game black started in the middle of the board. I didn't really
know how to counterattack it, which was probably why I lost. I'm more
interested in any strategy or direction flaws.

Hello,
I'm Soneca (Bernardo Reis) and i'll review for you. My english is not so good but let's try.]
;B[jj]C[Tengen!

[S\]: Someday a 6d friend of mine told me something "If your opponent play a strange fuseki, don't be nervous... Play a regular one and go for the victory"

You don't need to "change" or fuseki just because or oponent is playing a strange one, you can just choose the right one that you already know and play your best.]
;W[pd];B[po]C[Black
certainly decided to start off with some interesting openings-this is
hardly ever used, which made me consider this good reviewing material.


[S\]: Black is playing for influence. You can try to Mess up his plan or play your on plan.]

(;W[fp]C[Would attaching at C5 have been better?

[S\]: i think you don't play wrongly... if you play c5, the sequence would make black strong.]

(;W[jq];B[dn];W[pq]C[I
think playing around C10 would've been better as it would be attacking
the C3-D6 stones.

think right now a play around F16 would've been better. The two stones
in the upper right part aren't alive either, so I think I should have
attacked them.

for reviewing! Right now I think what made me lose was the lower right
corner and the top right as well. Suppose I could have won against
black's beginning after all if I hadn't made those mistakes? :P



Well, was a nice game.... The P3 stones was a big loss for White, and up right corner was not so bad, the bad thing was letting Black invade at N11. 

The Yose have to much gote, if you pratice yose you can win like 5 points per game


Well, that's it... I hope you could learn something, Cya
