C[Hello, thank you very much for your review.
I didn't really enjoy this game. No real weak groups on either side. But those kind of games usually give me the most problems.

J: Hi my name is Jay and I will be review your game.  My comments will start with "J:"]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[dp];W[qp];B[oc];W[fq];B[op]C[J: since white is already at F3, white can think about pincer here, or even play D6 right now.]
;W[oq]
(;B[nq]C[J: Black can also think about playing in the Q4, because the right side is wider.]
;W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[jq]
(;W[cn]C[J: can also consider pincering high at D6 here.];B[dn]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp];W[cl]
(;B[gp]C[J: G4 leaves a lot of aji around, should consider E3. Later, white can try to push out at F4, aiming to cut D5.]
;W[fc]
(;B[bd]C[J: feels a bit early, Q10 is fairly large.];W[cd];B[be]
;W[bc]
(;B[ch]C[J: black should play B18 for aji.];W[cj];B[bb]C[I am not sure anymore if this was a good move, since it removed endgame points. However I thought if white drops down, maybe it creates some aji that I might be able to use later, however that was not the case...

J: order is wrong because white may choose to ignore this right now.]

(;W[ac];B[eh]C[Defending here was necessary, I judged. Was this correct?

J: yes, a better shape for defense would be D14.];W[qi]C[J: j17 is bigger because H17 is sente for black.]
;B[kc]C[Should black have extended further? But then I was afraid of a possible white invasion and then black wouldn't have enough space to make a base.

Black should extend all the way to H17];W[ic];B[qg];W[oi]
(;B[po]C[J: Q5 not needed right now. white ca actually defend with Q6.  Instead black can play Q4 and then P7 directly.]

(;W[qo];B[om];W[jo];B[ip]C[Was this to passive? But I wanted to keep F 3 dead...

J: it's ok, definitely, K7 also is possible. if black really wants to kill of F3, should play G3 to reduce aji.]
;W[og];B[ql];W[pl];B[qj]
(;W[pj]C[J: white can try R12 instead here.];B[qk];W[pm];B[ri]
;W[on];B[nn]C[I am not sure anymore if this move was worth playing it. But I thought it keeps the opportunity of attacking K 5. If white would've been able to play N 6 for example, there is no more attacking. But I don't know if those thoughts are accurate.

J: this result is good ok black.];W[mc]C[I thought about the kosumi too, but white would get out and then black needs to live with L 17 and C 12 still isn't completly safe, so I judged connecting under would be the best way of playing.]
;B[mb]C[J: connection is ok here.];W[nb];B[nc];W[lb];B[md];W[lc]
;B[ld];W[kb];B[kd]C[J: black should trade P18 first. It's bigger than L17.]
;W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[jm];W[km];B[kl];W[lm]
(;B[jn]C[Should black have just connected here instead at K 8?

J: K8 would be a bit too slow.  Can try M8 and then split around O8.]
;W[lo];B[nm];W[ll];B[kp];W[ko]C[J: White should ignore this for now and atari L9.]
;B[kk];W[lk];B[kj];W[io];B[hp];W[ne];B[nd];W[nk];B[fm]C[J: F7 is tiny.]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[pg];B[qf];W[bg]
(;B[cf]C[J: black can also try B12, to put pressure on white's left group.]

;W[fe];B[hn];W[cg]
(;B[dg]C[J: black must play D14 to connect.];W[df];B[hg]C[J: h13 is trying too hard to force points in the center, instead black should develop it natrually with moves like J16. B5, R18 are also large moves.]
