C[Dear reviewer,

thank you very much for having a look at this game. I can see three reasons for losing this game, all mistakes in the late middle game or endgame. But these mistakes are easily to see. What I am interested more are the general mistakes and misleading thinking I have as a DDK player. All help in these "blind spots" will hopefully allow me to improve. So I will not try any wild guesses and am curious for your review. That said, I marked the three mistakes I was talking about.

Thank you very much for taking your time to review this, it's much appreciated!

Best regards

Morris

Dear Morris, I will do my best to help you. Like you, I often think "if only I had not made that mistake right at the end", but often when I review I realise that I had actually gone badly wrong much earlier. So, I shall try to find your "hidden blunders" and help you to stop making them :-)

Tami (from L19x19), Himiko on KGS and Kaya];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp]
;W[dc];B[oq];W[qj]C[Tami - good move, as getting the extension here would have been too good for Black.]
;B[qg]C[Tami - also a very good move, pushing white toward your strong stones.

PRINCIPLE - Push the enemy toward your strong stones!];W[qm]
C[Tami - good move, making a base. 

PRINCIPLE - Do not miss the point that makes or breaks the base]
;B[de]C[Tami - so far, a perfect opening as far as I can tell. You take the biggest move (approaches are equal in value to enclosures)]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[cj];W[cl]C[Tami - you are about to make your first mistake...

PRINCIPLE - Be concerned when approached on both sides!]
(;B[fq]C[Tami - you should not ignore C8.

Let's remember the principle "Do not miss the move that makes or breaks the base"]
(;W[jq]TR[oq]C[Tami - I think this is a bad move. Black's marked stone provides support should Black choose to fight instead of invading the corner, and blunts any thickness White might build should Black choose to enter the 3-3 point instead.]
(;B[lq]C[Tami - I believe this is a good move, taking away the base and gaining points.]
;W[jo]C[Tami - I'd go for the 3-3 point now.]
(;B[lo];W[eq];B[ip];W[jp]C[Tami - OK, I think you handled this situation pretty skilfully! This kikashi makes shape for you and makes White heavy.

If M3 were absent, then White would have been stronger, not heavier, but since you have strong stones nearby, I think your way of play leads to an excellent sabaki.

I think here I am learning from you! Thanks!]
(;B[fp]
(;W[dn];B[gn]TR[jo][jp][jq]C[Tami - Black has made sabaki (a playable fighting position in an opponent's sphere of influence). Now it is White that is looking very open for attack.]
;W[ch]C[Tami - this is a sharp move. The game is now very chaotic. White has been injured in the exchanges at the bottom, but your earlier omission of the honte has provided her with this counter-attack.]
;B[ei];W[eh];B[fi];W[di];B[dj];W[fh];B[gi];W[gf]
(;B[ed]C[Tami - just call them "junk stones" and THROW THEM AWAAAAAAYYYYYY!!!!]

;W[hh];B[bf];W[bh];B[dg];W[dh];B[ig]C[Tami - you are probably saving the stones. But how much territory are they surrounding????]
;W[he];B[mc]C[Tami - White can counter-attack.]
(;W[kc]C[Tami - this ought to lose the game now.]
(;B[je]TR[ge]C[Tami - you missed your chance! Were you trying to use the marked stone?]
;W[id]
(;B[hi]C[Tami - wrong direction.];W[ih];B[jj];W[jh];B[kg];W[ki]
;B[ji];W[kh]
(;B[jm]C[Tami - you don't want to be giving White counterplay, although I see this is meant as a splitting attack.]
(;W[ro]C[Tami - irrelevant. It's an endgame move, which should be saved until the endgame.]
(;B[rp]TR[hg][ig][kg][ih][jh][kh]C[Tami - ditto. This move is not urgent (you won't die even if you do choose to ignore it). The fight between the marked groups is the ONLY important matter now.]

(;W[sc]C[Tami - no need, and so white effectively says "pass"]

;B[le];W[ld];B[me];W[ke];B[kd];W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[gq];W[kj]
;B[om];W[ri]TR[kh][ki][jo]C[Tami - I think now would be a good stage to judge the position.

If Black completes the capture of the two marked groups, the lead is so huge there is no need for counting.

So, Black should simply remove all the chances White might have for causing trouble.]
(;B[so]TR[lc][kf][ej][jk]C[Tami - you still have a few weak places. Not enough to be difficult yet, but since you are far ahead, it would make a lot of sense simply to take away the last chances.

Tami - yes, probably White would have failed anyway, but the point is that you went later wrong in the complications, and you could have avoided the complications in the first place.]
