C[Dear reviewer

I played white in this game. After the opening, I lost several points due to misreads (reading laziness), later the game was decided by a cut, which I didn't read out well. 

At the beginning I am not sure if I treated the san ren sei opening in a good way. Later in the game I have the feeling that I missed some big moves and concentrated too much on small fighting.

Any advice is highly appreciated, thank you in advance for your efforts.

Hello.

All my comments will start with the "###" (because why not..)
I'm not a native speaker, so you might smile over the spelling sometimes. :)

First, sorry about the delay, I must have accidentaly deleted the first notice GTL sent me..
Were it was relevant, I also commented some black's moves.

To sum it up, it was a nice game and you stood better for the most part of it. Got into a fight early but then got a better result in the upper left and set up a nice moyo. It was a sort of a "quick" game, since after the first the fight and then the joseki in the upper left, it was already becoming a sort of a large endgame.

"The cut" of course, was a sad affair.
About the sequence played in the lower right, I was getting quite lost in variations myself, so I hope my advice there won't be too confusing..

Moves that stood out in the game are "the turn" (which I liked a lot), the tiger's mouth in the upper left which left me startled and "the cut" (which might be the game losing move, since the corner is really big.

Hope you can get something useful out of the review. :)

Any questions - about things in the review, or just anything really - I won't mind to answer. 
Either by email (brinda0111@gmail.com) or on KGS (JanBwinda).]

You will almost never see this move in stronger players games. It's better to jump to san-san imediatelly or play the joseki starting with D11.
That's because this destroys the posibility of playing the 3-3.]

These turns are often the "million dollar turns" (or it was some similar name..) and can be insanely big.

This turn, for example, is quite awesome. :)
(also preventing E8 or similar moves)

Even if B keeps all the points on the right side, W has more - so he has a psychological advantage. It's B's time now to try and make some trouble.]

I believe this is a mistake, because you lose the 3-3 invasion. 
By now you probably know how much I like to invade 3-3 xD ..but that's because it's big and it usually works.

W may want to cut and attack B in the center, but:
1) B is in the center, thus safe (lots of room to escape)
2) W is still weak on the bottom right];B[pe];W[of];B[og]

Since B can connect at move 27 (maybe see that first), W could try going into the corner now. Not sure exactly how it'll go, but W should live in the corner.
