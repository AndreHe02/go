AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Sirkut> Hi James.  Thanks for submitting your game.  I'll preface all my comments with 'Sirkut>', the name I use on KGS.  I hope you find my comments helpful.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.]
;W[jq];B[jd];W[jj];B[cn];W[hc]
(;B[fc]TR[dc][df]C[Sirkut> The last two openning moves were a bit aggressive and don't put your handicap stones to a great use.  

The important thing to notice is that all except the last two stones of yours are high, on the 4th line, which only create influence and do not claim territory.

Moves like D17 will make a 3-3 invasion  more difficult.  D14 is a faster move that is strong but doesn't claim as much territory.  The 4-4 is too high to be strong on it's own, it need some direct back-up.]
;W[jc];B[lc]C[Sirkut>  You're better off playing away from you opponent's stones.  Don't encourage your opponent, who by the sake of the handicap is stronger, to fight before you have to.]
;W[kc];B[ld];W[kd];B[le];W[id]C[my statagy was to build a strong wall

Sirkut> I like it.  Just don't expect to keep it all and you'll be fine. :)]
;B[pj]TR[qj]C[Sirkut> Since you already have many stones on the high 4th line, I think R10 would have been better.]
;W[qc]C[should have expected that];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re]
;W[sd];B[qf];W[rb];B[ob];W[pb]C[Sirkut> Looked pretty close to a perfect response to me.  It really was a waste for white to play the 3x3 so early.]
;B[qn]TR[ci][np][dq]C[Sirkut> This side is getting pretty heavy.  I like something like O4, D3 or C11 better.]
;W[se];B[sf]C[how do i avoid cuts like this?];W[od]
(;B[oe]C[Sirkut> The trick is to not let cuts make you nervous so that you lose the big-picture. A few moves ago you looked strong because you had a large wall facing a large corner shape, and you still are.  Try not to play so close to the situation and you'll find that you'll be more effective and you're moves will start to serve more than one purpose.  See variation.]
;W[nd];B[nc];W[ne];B[of];W[nf];B[og];W[ng];B[nh];W[oh]C[again did not expect cut
what should have i done?

Sirkut> Always expect cuts; A common saying is 'cut soon and cut often.'  I'm not sure that I agree with that, but many players will cut whenever they have the chance.  This situation is not bad; You have plenty of options.  See variations.]

(;B[ph];W[oi];B[pg];W[pi];B[qi];W[mh];B[oj];W[ni]C[Sirkut> Looked like a good sequence to me.]
;B[nl]TR[pq]C[Sirkut> This doesn't get you much when there are much larger spots on the board.  I would have done something more like Q3, or just tenuki'd to grab larger points.]
;W[nj];B[nk];W[rg];B[rf];W[pe]C[is my variation better?]
(;B[qg];W[qe];B[gq];W[ri];B[rj];W[qq]C[the 3-3 again

Sirkut> You rarely see a handicap game without at least one 3-3 invasion.  Typically however they are closer to the end game when they can be used together with other influence on the board.  As an invasion by itself the 3-3 doesn't get much.]
;B[pq];W[qp]
(;B[pr];W[qo];B[po]C[tried to avoid cuts but lost territory]
;W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[rl];W[qr];B[sl];W[so];B[lq];W[sm];B[pl]
TR[jo][ip]C[Sirkut> Again, I think that was a fine response.  I don't think this move was necessary.  Look at the effect J4 or K5 could have now with your influence on both sides.  I like J4 better because it pushes white into your strength, while K5 gives white the option to go either way.]
;W[ci]
(;B[cg]C[Sirkut> A good proverb is "Choose profit over glory."  Something more conservative would be better here especially knowing how much white likes the 3-3! ;)  C16 would really discourage this.  See variation.]

;W[ad];B[ae];W[bb]C[thought about playing 3-3 in lower left but was afraid of getting cut

Sirkut> Yes it was important to protect here, especially since white had B11 to connect to.]
;B[cf];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]
(;B[fg]C[Sirkut> You may have noticed that this move didn't get you much in this area, but cost quite a bit in the corner.  White would be crazy to not take any chance to expand a strong corner.  See variation.]

TR[ke][kl][jn][ip]C[trying to build territory
mabe should have played on lower side

Sirkut> You actually already had that territory and were playing inside what you had claimed.  I've marked a vew moves that would have extended your territory and put white on the defensive.  I think L8 and K6 best take advantage of white's weakness on the lower side that you noticed.]
;W[je]
(;B[lm]C[maybe should have played one space lower

Sirkut> Not a bad move.  One line lower would have protected your existing territory more, while L8 would be a larger threat to cutting off white's lone stone.]

[oc][ld][le]C[Sirkut> This move doesn't get you any territory and does not directly help the marked group's situation.]

;W[mk];B[mj];W[lk];B[li]C[tryed to cut maybe not a good idea

Sirkut> I don't think it was a bad idea.  As long as you can get it connected to some other group and keep your other groups alive, then you're keeping white from turning that space into territory.  It was too close to white's strength for you to gain it as territory, so messing it up for white is the next best thing! :)]

[nr][or][ns]C[Sirkut> That was a good game, thanks for submitting it!

You only lost by a few small mistakes.  Contrary to how you felt, I think you handled the 3-3 invasions well.  You could put your 4-4 handicap stones to better use though by using them to be just a bit more defensive in the openning.  Also if you focus a little more on gaining corner and side territory first, and get caught up in local contact battles a little less, I think your game will improve quickly.
