RE[B+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

;B[pd]C[Ted: As happens in a lot of my games, I fall badly behind early on, and I can't figure out where I'm going wrong.  I've looked at the last couple of games I've had reviewed, and I don't see the similarities between them and this game.

Also, I don't see the difference between my attacks, which go wrong, and my opponent's attacks, which seem to work.  In both cases, I'm the one to end up with the weak groups.


djna: Thank you for the opportunity to review this game, I hope you find my comments helpful. 

I agree with your fundamental analysis, B has ended up with a lost game quite early. Your impulse to resign was probably right - I can see no winning chances by move 96. Let's see if we can pinpoint some mistakes of strategy.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[qf]C[Ted: This was the first place (of many) that things went wrong for me.

djna: The books are not enthusiastic about approaching here. They suggest the continuation shown in the variation]

(;B[qh]
(;W[of]LB[nc:E][qi:A][qj:B][pn:C][qq:D]TR[qh][qk]SQ[ri][si]
[rj][sj]C[Ted: On second thought, I should have played at R17 and contented myself with a small life, letting Black get a lot of territory on the other side.

djna: Yes, I don't like this move, must admit that as B I prefer the pincer  to the variation.

There are some  important things to notice here. 1). The marked stones are now pretty strong, an ideal extension. They are not weak. Later in the game you compare with a group of your own, that is much weaker. We need to compare and contrast.

2). They have made hardly any solid  territory, the four marked points probably can be though of as territory, but later W might even be able to play  at A or B.

3). There is no thickness here. In emergency W can press against these stones.

4). To build significnat  territory from these stones needs several moves. C would be a decent addition, but even that doesn't secure the side - W at D would probably work as an invasion

These may be the reasons why the book suggests the variation for 7.

I agree with you that diving into the corner might be better. Or also a double approach move at E might be interesting. See variation.]
;B[nd];W[pi]LB[ph:D][rh:C][qi:B][qk:A]C[
djna: without the stone at A this is joseki, with it I think you just make B stronger.

Previously W had possibilities of playing B, C or D to make shape if needed.

how about one more one point jump instead?];B[qi];W[ph];B[qn]
C[

djna: I think this is a bit slow - third line territory doesn't grow so fast.]
;W[jq]LB[ri:1][si:2][rj:3][sj:4][rk:5][sk:6][rl:7][sl:8][rm:9]
[sm:10][rn:11][sn:12][ro:13][so:14][qq:B][pr:A]TR[qn][pq]C[Ted: Seeing the two stones at Q3 and R6, I didn't feel I could let Black play here.  But already, Black's got a lot of territory on the side and I've got a weak group.

djna: This is a good move by W.


B invested a move on the right but didn't completely remove aji in the corner, A or maybe even B probably can keep the corner to something quite small considering the number of stones already invested. We can estimate 14 points taken, and potention for a further 12 if B gets to play one more move in the corner. Not so bad.

The real issue is that the W group on the upper right side takes zero points. 

However I don't think you should see it as a truly weak group - it is well out to the centre.]
;B[mq]LB[po:C][oq:B][pr:A]C[
djna: this is very slow, even now A or B  look like working and C could be used to keep this under control.]
;W[gq]LB[di:A]C[Ted: I wonder if I shouldn't have played K5 instead.  But seeing what happened at the top of the board, perhaps it wasn't such a bad idea to prevent a Black invasion here.

djna: my preference would be to play  A and try to develop quickly. Effectively you are playing the same style as B but he is one move ahead all the time.]
;B[cn];W[cl]LB[bp:B][cp:A]C[Ted: The pincer attack doesn't seem to work so well for me.


I would just play A or B and say "Look my side is as big as yours"]
;B[cp]
(;W[dq]C[Ted: I think I should have played at C3 instead, but I can't read out what would happen if Black plays at D5.

djna: yes, hard to read but this is much too timid. Sometimes we just have to go on gut feel, we outnumber B so we play the risky move.]
;B[cq];W[do]
(;B[dr]C[

djna: overplay I think. see variation]
(;W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[dm]LB[dq:B][gq:A]TR[bo]C[Ted: I don't like the shape of my stones at the bottom.  It looks like something's gone wrong, but I'm not at all certain where.

djna:  You are over-concentrated. A was originally too slow and then B compounded this.

Now B has played a dubious move, he has a weekness at the marked point - see variation]

(;W[ci];B[cg]CR[pd]LB[qf:B][dl:C][qn:A][bo:D]TR[qh][qk]SQ[ci]
[cl]C[Ted: I don't see how this move can be any better than my play at R14.


djna: it all depends upon how strong you see the marked W stones as being.

The original two B stones on the right are very strong, even without a B stone at A  they are under no threat,

The marked B 4-4 stone is also strong, it can run in all directions.

How strong is the W group on the left ? Actually it's stronger than you appeared to think because of the weakness exposed at D by a move at (or near) C.

So I think B has rather staked the game on this move.

Remember, it's reasonable to have one weak group on the board, so B has now announced where he has placed his weak group.

At this point W needs a plan - he needs to build a territory equivalent to B's bottom right.

That looks like it  needs to be at the top];W[ce]C[

djna: surely must be right];B[dh];W[di]LB[dl:A]C[

djna: perhaps A instead];B[fh]C[

djna: now W seems to nhave an isolated group and less power at the top.]

(;W[jc]LB[lc:A]C[

djna: suppose B answers defensively.what's the score? See variation


The game is now very difficult for W.

The only plan I can see for W is shown in the variation]
(;B[gc]TR[cg][dh][fh]C[

djna: this works unless W can separate the marked B stones]
;W[mc]LB[lc:A][oc:B][rd:C][ge:D]TR[jc]C[Ted: I thought this was a good move, putting pressure on the stones at O and Q16, but all that happened was that I ended up with another weak group.


djna: it's a good idea, you must strengthn your markeed  stone so that you can attack B, but you also need to keep the B corner small

How about A instead? You can either follow up at  B or C and still keep sente to come back to D]
;B[nc];W[nb]C[
djna: losing move I think];B[ob];W[mb];B[re]C[

djna: B takes large corner];W[qg]C[

djna: really should be the losing move, it's worth a few points and makes shape for the group, but there's no time]
;B[rh]LB[gc:A]C[

djna: ? look after A and it's game over];W[fd]LB[ge:A]C[Ted: The point here was to put pressure on the G17 stone, but it didn't quite work out that way.


djna: correct idea - whether A works better is very hard to tell.]
;B[fc];W[ed];B[ec];W[db]C[Ted: I didn't like the idea that I was leaving a weakness at D16, but I also didn't like the idea of Black playing at D18 first.


djna: this sems good to me.];B[gd]
(;W[je]SQ[ec][fc][gc][gd][cg][dh][fh]C[Ted: I have a feeling this was a mistake, but there's the proverb about attacking from the weaker side, and I felt this side was weaker than the top left corner.


djna: proverbs such as separate your oppoents groups also apply.

The next few moves are fatal for W. W must keep the two groups separated

At first sight the current move looks good: Make strength then attack, but I can't find any good refutation to B's response.

So instead I think you have take the risk of playing something more direct, as per the variations.]
;B[fe];W[ee];B[gf];W[jg];B[ef]LB[me:B][dl:A]C[

djna: is this really forcing? I don't see a need to respond. Instead  A, followed by an invasioon of the bottom right.

Or as as B causes all sorts of problems later how about B now? Join the groups together? Even sketach a little territory.]
;W[cd];B[me]C[Ted: Now Black's going to split these two groups.

djna: W just has to take a few risks now, play active moves, be prepared to scrifice a few stones.]
;W[ld]C[

djna: purely defensive];B[ok]C[

djna: huge, W needed to play here];W[ni];B[mk]C[

djna: this is effectively a resignation sequence. B takes territory while W is defending]

(;W[li]LB[me:A][ok:B]TR[qf][qg][ph][pi]C[Ted: After playing this move, I realized that Black was going to respond with N6.  But the problem is, where am I supposed to get eyes for the stones on the right?


djna: Yes the position is almost hopeless by now. You either had to play A earlier, or run the group across B's territory by playing B, this may lead to your giving up some of the 4 marked stones, but notince that the only role those 4 stones play is to say "Where are my eyes?"]

;B[kn];W[lr]C[Ted: I don't think this sequence has done much for me, but I don't see what I should have done instead.  I've got weaknesses all over the board, and I don't see any Black weaknesses to exploit.]
;B[mr];W[co];B[bo];W[bm];B[bn];W[dn]C[Ted: This sequence hasn't worked out well for me, either.  But I don't see much better.]

djna: B has no week groups to attack, you have no interesting invasions to make and you are very behind on territory. Now is the time to resign.

Just suppose that B fouls up and the marked stone is lost, suddenly the game might be fun.]
