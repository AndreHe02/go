It's fine. Heavy means it is hard to make it live, but you can't sacrifice it because it's survival is important to you. Your group is alive.]

Thanks for the time you spent !

Good game. It was good to see you concentrate on setting a base in the corner, then spreading out. 
Thinking about which groups are weak (both yours and your opponent's) and how to attack their weakness (and of course, defending your own) will be useful. It will definitely help you in further games.]

(;B[jc]C[Even if white extends from his line, points made in the centre are hard to make, and easy to lose.]
)
(;B[dj]C[Here, B could become a very big threat. W could be separated, and leave one group much weaker than the other. Even if W defends well, B can easily run.]

(;B[jp]C[K4 is a good move. Joins groups together and makes it even MORE daunting for W to invade.]
)
(;B[jd]C[k16 extends your group on the top left, and attacks W at the same time. W must make a base and/or run. Both of which are not a threat to B, W's gain is small compared to B's gain.]
)
(;B[pf]C[Any sort of move like this (extends from top right) can be dangerous to W groups on the top and on the right. W can only protect one, leaving the other at B's mercy. >=D]
