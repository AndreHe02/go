C[Thanks for taking your time. I am black!

BL: Hello Tequs, I'm Bruno Lucena 1d, and I hope I can help you improve.
My comments will be signed as "BL".

First of all, one thing that I saw at this game, is that you do not have a strategy while playing. If you want to improve and get better, you have to learn how to make a strategy and how to make all of your stones work together to make that strategy works. Think of your stones as a whole group, not separated ones. You don't want to have a group doing one thing while another group is doing another thing.
Also, you don't have to make a strategy on the beginning, you can see how the game evolves and then put a strategy. But in the middle game, you have to give strong purposes to every stone you put in the board.
Let's see in the game.

*I putted lots of variations. When one var shows up, just follow all the var in order.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dp];W[cd];B[qe];W[ec]LB[jd:B][cj:A]C[BL: A or B give almost an equal result, but if you play K16 and white C10, then you can go to Q10 and make two wings from your corner, wich is very good. The bad thing is that your lower stone will be weakened. That's why the result is equal. See var.]
(;B[cj]C[Is this good or is around K17 better?

BL: It's almost equal, but K16 is better. See var.];W[kc];B[pj]
LB[ch:B][fq:A][jq:C]C[Is that the largest point? Or maybe play somewhere else?

BL: This point it is the largest point, because it gives you a strong position in all the board.

The lower part of the board is the next big point, and both failed to play there. White should play A instantly. C may seen good, but can give a bad result to white.]
(;W[ch]LB[jp:A]C[BL: White failed to play at the bottom, black should play A. See var.]
(;B[cm]C[I feel this is urgent?

BL: Not so much. The last large point in the board is K3, and both failed to play there. See var.]
;W[fq]LB[jp:B][dq:A]
(;B[dq]C[I didn't want to pincer because of Q4. So I make safe.

BL: First really bad move. Should pincer. If you don't want to have problem with Q4, pince high. See Var.]
;W[iq]LB[ke:A][qn:C][hp:B][nq:D]SQ[fq]C[Now is very difficult for me to find a good spot to play...

BL: You missed the chance to geat an advantage. Now the game is equal.

This is where the beggining end,  and you have to analyze the whole situation to came up with an strategy. Since you has more influence and no weak group (white has the marked group as a little weak, with possible aji), you can go for the center to create a big moyo, playing move such as or B, or maybe you can continue to make solid positions, and start a fight, with C or D. See var.]
(;B[qn]C[So I play a kakari...

BL: Nice move. Taking the last big point, and starting your strategy (or we hoped so).]
;W[nq]C[BL: Poor move. Should play O4.

Now, you have the board. Strong groups and nice influence. White has some territory and an Aji with J3 and F3, wich you can exploit.
Moyo or fight?]
(;B[jd]C[Now it's even more difficult. So I play 17, the intension is that I don't want the white moyo to be too big on the upper left side.

BL: This move should be the start to a strategy of building moyo. Unfortunately, you played a poor move, wich allows white to break in the center, and give you your first weak group, one thing that you should avoid at all cost. Should have played L15. See var.

This is the losing move. Of course it still has a lot to play, but this move cost you all your possibly strategies.]
;W[kd];B[jc]C[BL: Now, two moves after starting the strategy, it is already gone. You have one weak group and can no longer attack efficiently. White has break in to the center, and you have no possibly moyo.]
;W[je];B[ie];W[jf];B[hc];W[if];B[he]C[BL: See the difference bettwen this variation and the one wich you played L15?
This way you have a almost dead group, wich doesn't make any points and no influence, while white has break into the center, making disapear all your chances to build up a moyo.]
;W[nd]
(;B[nb]C[Ok now I see this move is very small and I should not played here... but I was thinking I could put pressure on the group which was obviously wrong..

BL: You can't put pressure because your H15 group is really weak, so you should deffend it with H14.]
;W[ql];B[on];W[ol];B[mn];W[ml];B[kn];W[qh]LB[kq:A]C[BL: Now you could take advantage again, by playing at A and atacking J3 group. It would be really tough to white defend that group.]
(;B[nj]C[I have no plan here... when pincered I often panic and all I can do is run...

BL: You are just answering his moves. Think about it, and you will see the move that could give you the game. See var.]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[qk];B[qj];W[ri]C[I wanted to cut...somehow

BL: And you dit it. =\]];B[rl];W[rm];B[qm];W[sl];B[pl];W[sk]
;B[pk];W[mj];B[lq]C[BL: Now, you can have that advantage.];W[qp]
;B[ro]C[I didn't want him to connect and make the corner too big, maybe this is not urgent?]
;W[rp];B[jp]C[i want to make my group stronger and somehow attack him, but seems this move is weak..

BL: But your attack was weak.];W[jq];B[kq];W[ip];B[jo];W[er]
;B[dr]C[i see no bigger move, where i can tenuki];W[ni]C[I thought about o9, but it would gain not so much for me.]
;B[of];W[mf];B[hf];W[ng];B[hg];W[jh];B[eg];W[eh];B[cf];W[dg]
;B[ef];W[df];B[bi]C[I see no middle game moves anymore.

BL: Well, you still have to save H13 group.
But despite that, no comments from now.
You played the yose better.

I hope this review can help you improve. If you need any more help, just ask,

Thanks.

So, you don't have to read 50 moves forward to see how the game will evolve, you just have to see the game strategically, and you wil eventually see the whole game.
