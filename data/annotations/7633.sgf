C[Hi Justin!

I will provide the best advice I can. My comments may be blunt but I want to tell you directly so you can get the most from the review.

C[O17 is more typical than N17. If black ignores this move, then white doesn't have a very good follow up. The move is 'slack'.]
;B[mq];W[cj]C[Instead of C10, D10 is a better move. Because it is on the fourth line, it creates a larger 'box' for potential territory and works well with the enclosure in the bottom left corner. Still, white's opening is much better than black's opening. Black has invested four moves to secure the bottom right corner, when it is possible to secure the bottom right corner with just two moves. Though black's lower right corner is secure, it is very overconcentrated.]
;B[nc];W[md];B[qf];W[ic];B[pj]C[Black's fuseki at this point is terrible, and extremely overconcentrated on the right side. Although he has invested three moves into the top right corner, it is definitely still possible to invade the top right corner at 3-3 or some probe.]
;W[gl]C[jada:  bad, bad misclick.  should have asked for an undo.  oh well.]
;B[jq];W[nj]C[jada:  i felt like the reduction was important, but if i had defended, it might have given me the lead.

Although black has more 'secure territory' in the lower right, his top right corner can easily be invaded and you have much better potential for overall territory. Black should be the one trying to stop you from turning your framework into territory. Instead of O10, a move like N13 or O13 would start to enclose a massive area that will be much larger than black's territory. He is the one that needs to invade your area instead.]
;B[gq];W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[ho];W[gn]C[A double hane is possible in this position. Instead of G6, you could play H6 and still be okay. Part of getting better is figuring out which moves gain the most without being overplays.]
;B[hn];W[jl];B[cc]C[An unfortunate well-timed invasion by black.]
;W[dc]C[Blocking towards the other direction is better. The J17 stone is closer than the C10 stone to your D16 stone. it is more efficient if your wall faces a stone that is farther away.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[bf];B[ad];W[fc]
;B[af];W[bg];B[bc];W[ng]C[jada:  i was glad for this invasion and the thickness it gave me.  and also that i got sente.

Good move.];B[ne];W[me];B[nf];W[mf];B[nh];W[mh];B[og];W[mg]
;B[ll]
(;W[kk]C[jada:  seems like a big mistake.  too aggressive.  allows black to poke through.

This move actually works, after black M9, you block with white M10.]
;B[lk];W[kj];B[li];W[lj];B[mi];W[kh];B[lh];W[lg]C[It would be better to play L13 instead of M13 to eliminate weaknesses in your wall.]
;B[ki];W[ji];B[jh]C[jada:  at this point, i was agitated and didn't want to play submissively.

In most situations, I would definitely agree. However, it is possible to cut off the K12 stone in this situation. See the variation.]
(;W[ni];B[kg];W[mj]C[A slightly better move would be to capture the O12 stone instead. If black pushes at N10, he will be atari'd and must connect his black stones. If you capture the O12 stone isntad, later on you can push into his right side territory.]
;B[kh];W[ii]C[Here it is probably possible to play J12 instead, J11 gives black more room to work with.]
;B[ke];W[kc];B[ih];W[ie]C[jada:  i knew i needed to stay calm and keep my groups safe while taking away eye space.]
;B[hi];W[ij]C[Cutting at H12 is the correct move. If you notice, black's group is weak and completely surrounded by your stones. If you cut him in half, his L12 stones no longer have enough space to make eyes. Even if his L12 group did live somehow in gote, his H11 stone would be cut off and the entire left/bottom-left area would likely become your territory. Also, the empty triangle here is bad shape. Even if the correct move was not to cut, if he ataris your stones, you are in no trouble.]
;B[if];W[hf];B[hg];W[jf];B[ig];W[kf];B[gf];W[he];B[hj];W[ik]
C[Here you can block at H9. He cannot atari your stones and try to cut them off at the same time because you can always connect at O12.]
;B[gh];W[fg];B[hl];W[hk];B[gk];W[hm];B[il]
(;W[im]C[jada:  this probably wasn't necessary.  this move and P12 were miai to save my central group.  F9 could have been more severe.

Yes, F9 would definitely have worked well.];B[fk];W[gg];B[fh]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[ej];B[fj];W[ei];B[fi]
(;W[dh]C[jada:  looks like E9 would have been better.  defending this close to my thickness was unnecessary.

Yes, E9 would have likely closed him off from the bottom side. If he pushes through at D12 there's nowhere he can go to make another eye.]
;B[ek];W[dj];B[fl];W[fm]C[Instead of F7, it is possible to block him off at C7 or D7.]
;B[em];W[en];B[dm];W[cl];B[dn];W[eo];B[cm];W[bm];B[bn]
(;W[co]C[jada:  bad idea.  letting a stone be captured on 2nd line = eye.  either way, it's hard to prevent the second eye even before this move.

Yes, an unfortunate mistake.];B[do];W[dp];B[bl];W[bk];B[am]
(;W[dl];B[dk];W[ck];B[el];W[bo];B[cn];W[nl];B[nm];W[mm];B[mn]
;W[lm];B[ol];W[ok]C[jada:  O9 would have been more solid.

Actually in the local situation, P9 is better than O9. Later on you can push at Q9 and do some sabaki (sacrifice) techniques to break through his right side area.]
;B[km]
(;W[kn]C[jada:  greedy move.  but i made it work for me, in the end]
;B[ml]
(;W[ln]C[See variations.];B[nk];W[kl];B[oj];W[nd];B[od];W[of]
;B[oe];W[oh];B[pf];W[lp];B[lo];W[mo]C[jada:  this and M4 seem greedy.  but, luckily, i made it work later.]
;B[ko];W[jn];B[nn]C[jada [11k\]: really greedy];W[jo]C[jada:  this is where i realized how to use the aji of M4 and N5]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[kq];W[ip];B[hp];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[js];W[gr]
C[Nice!];B[ph];W[oi];B[pi];W[al]C[jada:  this does not actually start a ko, haha]
;B[ak];W[aj];B[al];W[nb];B[oc];W[qa]C[jada:  i learned something about the monkey jump, here.  if you're not connected, you can't do it, haha]
;B[ob];W[qc]C[jada:  is it possible to live in the corner?  i didn't think so, but i played R17 anyway.

It is not possible to live in this corner if the defender plays the correct moves.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[re]
(;W[sc]C[It is possible to create a ko with S18 instead of T17. If black ataris by playing T16, white plays T17 and the ko begins. However, black could have prevented this possibility if he played different moves in the corner.]
;B[rb];W[mb];B[pa];W[ag];B[ae];W[ao];B[an];W[jg];B[hh];W[mk]
;B[nl];W[na];B[oa];W[hs];B[is];W[ea];B[da]
(;W[tt]C[jada:  5 minutes after we finished the game, i saw the move at L2.  it could have won the game for me.  the rest of these moves have no effect on the score (black is ahead by 3.5).  he was just hoping i would make a mistake.  maybe he didn't realize he was winning.]

;B[ci];W[di];B[je];W[lf];B[ge];W[gd];B[hd];W[id];B[fd];W[gc]
;B[ef];W[dg];B[tt]C[Nice game! There are two specific guidelines, that if you follow now, you will get INSTANTLY stronger. 
Firstly, you need hane (wrap around the opponent's stones) more often, which is part of the strategy of shape. There are several points where you could have hane'd to get more territory or cut the opponent and rob him of liberties or eye space. Your opponent can often cut your stones, but know that often you are in the advantageous position if he tries to cut you. This is especially true when there is an invading group deep in your area. 
Secondly, you need to learn not to attach stones to a weak group unnecessarily, which is part of the strategy of attacking. When you attach to an opponent's group, you make the opponent's group and your own group stronger. If your opponent's group is weak, and your group is already strong, then the weak group benefits from being strengthened the most. There are some points where you had no choice but to push along with black's moves, but several times you could have enclosed black with a farther enclosing move and killed him for sure.

The advice may seem contradictory, but when you figure out which of these moves are better in the specific situation you will improve greatly. I hope my review helped you!
