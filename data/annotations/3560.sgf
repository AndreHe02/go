C[*X*: Hi, my name's Alex Weldon.  I'm a 2d in Canada.  I'll be prefixing my comments with *X* (for "Xopods," my KGS/IGS username) to distinguish them from your own.  Hopefully I can be of some help.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qo]C[*X*: Unconventional, but not neccessarily bad.  You have to remember that you're emphasising the right side of the board now, though, so that will dominate the fuseki strategy for the next few moves.]
;W[dc];B[fq];W[hq];B[cq]C[*X*: You should jump out at F5 to build thickness (the joseki is almost the same as for komoku, low approach, one-space low pincer, jump out).  This move is inconsistent with R5.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[pq]C[*X*: Very bad choice for W, so your choice in the lower left turns out okay.  Instead, W should have played P4.]
;B[op]C[*X*: Yes, good, great.  I was worried that I was going to have to yell at you if you played anything other than this, but you did, and all is right in the world.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[mq];B[qj]C[My reason to play Q16+R5 is exactly this. I feel that the wall and the extension work very well with the 4-4 stone above.
The results of this moyo strategy have been, however, quite varied. Usually I end up having half of the right side (usually the upper half), in some cases more.
I feel, however, that the P4 group is left slightly weak (it's surprisingly weak at attacking a opponent reduction/invasion in the right side).
Of course I can't expect to get the whole right side, but the problem is that my opponent usually gets the whole lower side, specially if he gets to play M5 or similar. I usually would want to play M5 myself, but I often don't have the time (or else I have to make a quite courageous tenuki from somewhere else). (Actually if I were white I would play M5 right away.)
Is this strategy simply bad?

----

*X*: I can't say that Q16 and R5 are bad.  Certainly P4 is the right choice of joseki if W is foolish enough to approach at Q3.  The problem is that W can choose P4 instead of Q3, so you have to aim for a development in the lower left that makes P4 undesireable for W.  That's why you need to play F5 instead of C3.

Anyway, W did you a favour and you're winning now, by a significant margin. Enough that if you gave two pros this position, Black would win almost every game, I suspect.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]
(;B[de]C[Which is better, low or high approach?

*X*: You might not even want to approach.  You have a low, solid position in the lower left, so this area of the board is of little value.  I would play M5 to further push W down, and increase your moyo. N15 is also a good point for the same reason.  If W is timid enough to respond on both sides... (see variation)

If you insist on approaching, though, high is probably better, since you're too low on this side of the board already.  Make sure you don't extend in the direction of C6 though, since that has little value.]
;W[fd];B[cc]C[*X*: Better to tenuki than play this.  I'll explain in a few moves.]
;W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch]C[*X*: As I said, you wanted to avoid making an extension.  You're too low and overconcentrated on this side of the board now.  After C17 and C16 though, you do need an extension so as not to become heavy.  Therefore, perhaps the best thing to do after W F16 would be tenuki, and treat D15 lightly, since there are always sabaki possibilities in the corner.

If you were going to make an extension here, D13 would be better than C12.  You could also try to get D6 in sente first, but if he ignores D6 and pincers, things get sticky.]
;W[em]C[*X*: Ouch.];B[dk]C[Probably too territory-oriented? Perhaps something else would be better? M5?

*X*: This is very bad.  The threat of E7 is W C7, and this does nothing to protect against that, so it is essentially a wasted move.  If you're going to answer, playing C7 yourself is the correct move, slow as it looks.  However, the area between C6 and C12 is almost worthless, since those stones are both so low and strong.  Therefore, you can ignore E7; if W plays C7, you just descend to B6 and W hasn't gained much, since any thickness he gets faces another strong group.

Now is definitely the time you should M5, since you'd be threatening exactly the same thing (M3), but whereas the area around D9 is worthless, the area around K4 has potential because of the W wall.]
;W[qc]C[*X*: W  should N4.];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb]
;B[lo]C[This is one of the very few games where I actually get to play it.

*X*: FINALLY!  If you don't get to play it often, it's because you underestimate the value of it.  This should have been played a long time ago, instead of D15.]
;W[lq];B[fr]C[*X*: Too early.  You've heightened your moyo on one side, now play N15 to heighten it on the other.  If he answers that, then perfect it in the middle, and you should still have a won game, even after the bad move D9.]
;W[es];B[hp]C[This was probably a bad strategical mistake of mine. This ended up being a heavy group full of cutting points. The result at the end of the game was horrible to watch...
I suppose I forgot, once again, the principle of not playing close to thickness.

*X*: Yes.  This is horrible.  Before you add more stones like this, F3 is a light stone, full of aji.  That means that you have to wait for the right moment to use the aji.  If you try too early, you end up with a heavy group.  Better to leave it alone until you get more stones in the area through the natural flow of play.]
;W[gp];B[go];W[fp]
(;B[ip]C[*X*: W is playing submissively.  The last thing you want to do is make yourself heavy.  Play J3 for light shape.]
;W[oj]
(;B[ph]C[*X*: No, no, no.  Always play on the weaker side.  Q8 instead, and all your later troubles would be avoided.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[pl]C[*X*: Weird.  W usually crosscuts.  Q10 should be enough for B.]

(;B[ok]C[Don't try to be fancy.  Just Q10.];W[ol];B[nk];W[nl]
;B[ql];W[rk];B[rl];W[mk];B[nj];W[ml];B[pm]C[I was dubious about this move, but I made it because I felt that I didn't want white to cut my groups apart.
In the end, however, it resulted in that I left the P9 group too weak and it crumbled.

*X*: Q7 is useless.  S10 removes all aji and prevents him from separating you anyway.  However, you have to worry about your F4 stones now.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[cm];B[dn]C[Move made by instinct. Probably a mistake.

*X*: Yes.  This is a standard shape you should know.  B6 is usually correct.  However, because of G5, this allows for a clever sequence that I'll show in a variation a few moves ahead...]
;W[en];B[co];W[dm]
(;B[bk]C[Again, territory oriented. (I didn't want white to descend and enable two monkey-jumps or whatever. Was probably too soon to think about that.)

*X*: Small.  Never play territorial moves when there are heavy, weak groups on the board.  Play J3 in sente, then something around K8 to simultaneously defend your weak stones and attack his heavy center group.  Or play the sneaky sequence I'll show in the variation.]
;W[bl]C[*X*: You've handed W sente on a silver platter, and he just gives it right back to you.  He's too kind.]
;B[lc]C[Extremely wrongly timed invasion. I did not realize how weak the P9 group is. Although the invasion ended in a big success locally (even though it was probably because of a white mistake), P9 was destroyed and with it the J4 group died big. But how could I have foreseen this?

*X*: Hmm, well, you should have seen four things:

1) By omitting S10, you've left a lot of aji around there, especially with P10 hanging around, eating up your liberties.

2) J4 is not connected to M5 yet, so those stones are weak.

3) White's N8 group is very heavy and weak.  By fixing one or both of the aforementioned weaknesses, you'll bring it under attack, so W will not have the luxury of fixing his invasion points on the top side.

4) Even if this invasion worked out for you, all it would do is destroy some territory, since W is strong on both sides.  Instead, N15 would be sente, would build influence for you, would destroy almost as much territory as this invasion, and wouldn't create a weak group.  Keep in mind that reduction is often better than invasion.

Also, a general principle:

Mixed extensions are harder to invade than extensions all one one line.  Therefore, if you were going to invade, H16 is better for you than M17.]

;W[bn];B[bo];W[ao];B[ap];W[an];B[ar];W[ni]C[I actually didn't see this move until he played it. Aargh!
From this point forward my game was a big catastrophe. I ended up like 60 points behind.]
;B[oh];W[pj];B[ro];W[iq]C[I didn't see white's next move either. If I had, I would have, of course, protected, taking advantage of this white slow move. I didn't. I died.

*X*: W should never have been able to make this move.  J3 should have been your sente at any number of points in the game.]
;B[jp];W[mo]C[*X*: This is the "tesuji of striking through the knight's move."  At 3k, you should be familiar with it.  If you weren't before, hopefully the agony of what's about to happen to you should burn it into your brain so you see it next time.]

*X*: Worse than 60, actually... closer to 80, or maybe more.  But that's what you get for ignoring the principle of attacking/defending weak groups and creating/removing aji before you start worrying about territory.  You made bad, territorial moves on the left, but so did your opponent, so that worked out evenly... really, Q7 was probably the worst move of the game, when it should have been S10.  Aside from that, your biggest mistakes were handling the H4 stones badly early on, invading M17 for no good reason, and that you never even tried to attack W's N8 group, which was sitting heavy and weak in the middle of all your influence for the whole game!]
