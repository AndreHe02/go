AB[cc][gg]C[We have played this game with my wife with 2 handicap. I play 15k KGS, she has about 20k, but she playes occasionally. We have commented our moves during the game separately and then combined both comments in one SGF file. Please analyse the game for both players!!! The main question for white is: what was wrong during the beginning of the game? Black was winning in the beginning, and I don't really know, how to make my first moves. Thank you in advance for the review! Igor

>Hi. It is hard to review 9x9 games, because it's a pure fight. Every move leads to different  variations that completely changes the position on whole board. :)
>  Few comments about handicap games on 9x9.  Juan Guo 5p played several games vs bot on KGS with handicap 2 as an experiment. The result is the bot victory in about 70 % of the games. So we see that even with that huge difference in rank handicap = victory. 
> So... Right now black already won. The possibility for white is the black's mistake.]
