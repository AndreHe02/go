BenRoshi-
None of those moves are really "better" than the other.  It all depends on what your motives are.  You could use A  to be a bit more agressive, or b or c to go somewhere completly new.  I usually just stick with a simple move like your o16 or n17.]

I'm thinking that for black this move is a bit loose.  I'd play a more sturdy move like r15 or s16.]

BenRoshi-
Yeah your stone right here is disconnected from anything and things will be tough for you.  Another option could be making a smaller move to sturdy the bottom.  Right now you have 3 stones that really aren't connected at all, so it might be better to give them strength (especially with black's thickness on the right).]

I think this move should be replaced with something that grabs more territory like l4.]

That moves going to end up splitting up your groups, not keeping them together.  Instead, build them up seperatly.]

BenRoshi-
I can't see your marked A for some reason ^^;;.  But, I'm assumign you mean g18?  If so, yes it is better to defend the top right now because black's stones are really weak around q14 so they can't attack very easily.]

BenRoshi-
Well as I said before, those stones on the bottom are really disconnected and need strength.  When you have that situation, make sure to keep them on your mind so when you get sente and there aren't any other real big moves out there, go and build them up.]

BenRoshi-
No this is fine, though playing one farther to the left would be safer.  A would either be pushed aside easily, or cause a desperate fight which won't go well with your weak stones on the bottom.]
;B[gq];W[fn];B[kq];W[kp]C[BenRoshi-
Something like m5 would be better, but your hope of cutting off those bottom stones is pretty much dead right now.  Make sure the stones around n3 get away be a bigger priority, and maybe you'll get a chance to get just one of them.]

For the most part it was pretty good.  But your stones on the bottom left suffered from being too weak, and when black attacked them he was able to grab the bottom.  Just be able to keep them in mind, so that when you're given a good oppurtunity in sente to strengthen them you can use it.]
