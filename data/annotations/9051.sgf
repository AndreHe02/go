AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

I'm the B player.  I won by resignation, and we decided that I should give 2 stones rather
than take them, next time.  Even so, I feel that I made many moves in the wrong part of the board, in addition to tactical errors, and I would appreciate any comments or corrections.

I have included a number of questions of my own, explanations of what I thought I was accomplishing, etc.

Thank you!


* Hello, my name is Litost, and I'll be your reviewer. I play as 1d. I hope you will enjoy the review; do not hesitate to contact me if you have any question. All my comments will start with a star (*).

* I have two general remarks regarding this game. Firstly, I feel that you wanted to attack a bit too early, prior to stabilizing your shapes. As a result, you made it too easy for your opponent to strike back. Secondly, I also feel that you were following his flow too much.

* Go is a war game, so doing that is not unheard of :) For your next games, I suggest that you try and slow down the pace a little, simply reacting to your opponent rushing his attacks. The goal is to give more attention to shape - build strong shapes, force bad shapes on your opponent, then let the game develop. Do not attack from weak shapes.]
;W[po];B[dd];W[qf];B[nd]C[I assume a pincer is not called for, in this position.

* Your playing high here is fine, not only you make potential territory, play in harmony with D16, but you also reduce White's influence on the right side.]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[Should this have been a looser pincer,  to help the upper right corner?

* A looser pincer is certainly playable, but it would put less pressure on the white stone, and still leave invasion points at the top. This one is more severe, plus it has some relation with the shimari at the top right, so it cannot be bad.]
;W[fe];B[df];W[cc]C[W9 seems inconsistent with jumping out
at W7.

* Well, this is a joseki. We'll see what's interesting about it later.]
;B[dc];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[be]LB[fb:A][he:B][qe:E][fg:C]
[dh:D]C[* This is the end of the joseki.

* Let us assert the situation. Locally, White may want to descend to F18, so as to threaten a connection, or even build a little thickness towards the top. But doing that right now would be overplay: it would lack a sense of direction, and would make the white stones heavy.

* So, what's White purpose here? He has simply planted some aji, with the two white stones. Depending on how the game develops at the top or the side, then these stones could become significant. In handicap games, creating aji is quite important, as it complicates the game.

* Now, for black, many options can be considered.

* You can play at A. Granted, this looks slow, but then you remove most of the aji of the white stones, while reinforcing the H17 stone. You'd be rock-solid, and would gain some nice influence over the top and center, with the nice conjunction with the top-right shimari. In a handicap game, that'd be my first choice.

* You could play more dynamically at B, asking White what to do about the White stones. If White extracts them right now, for instance at C, then you'd be happy to play D, reinforcing your side stones naturally.

* Also, we must not forget that White has left the top right corner alone. The attachment at E, followed by a pincer, would be powerful.]

(;B[bf]C[* This is an overplay.];W[ce]
(;B[cf]C[* Have you consider blocking at D15? Would the end result be that bad? See the variation to check your reading.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[ef]MA[fe]C[With the marked W stone in place, were B's moves starting with B16 a mistake?

* Yes, I think so.];B[ed];W[fb];B[fd];W[ea];B[gd]LB[ff:a][eg:b]
MA[bf][cf][df]C[I thought somehow I didn't have time to cut at A because after WB I would scramble to defend  the three marked B stones, lose sente, and ultimately suffer W26 or at least W would gain something from the threat.

* Indeed. But White stones are floating, so you can fight. The problem is that if White stones develop towards the center, White can gain strength either to attack the top (your stones there are heavy), or the left. This is a result of the weak shape you have initiated by playing the B14 move.]
;W[eg];B[ch]LB[dh:A][ci:B]C[* This is a bit overconcentrated. What about A or B?]
;W[cj]
(;B[di]LB[eh:A]MA[fe][ef][eg]C[Lean on the lone W stone, ultimately surround the three marked W stones, which were separating  the two eyeless groups.

* Well, the idea is certainly interesting (capturing the cutting stones), yet I believe you'd spend quite a bit of moves to achieve it (i.e. little profit per move). In other words, it's slow.

* In this position, I wonder if attaching at E12 does not give a better result (because it does not induce a reinforcement of c10).]
;W[dj];B[ei];W[cn];B[fp];W[cq]C[I thought that W's side group was too weak for the invasion of W35.

* I agree. The problem here is that White first needs to stabilize his group on the left, so as to extract the E13 group to the center, and start the splitting attack that we have discussed before.

* Interestingly, you did not attack that white group in the left side, even though it did become weak. Why so? That would have been a flexible response to the development of the game.]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[bn]C[Here W defends the side instead of making his corner live.]
;B[an]C[But this move was B's mistake,  as a few later
moves show.

* A5 is indeed more solid. Still: why would it be a mistake? If White lives in the corner and make 5 points using 10 stones, we're pretty happy, right? You want an opportunity to attack the side group, which is why you blocked the corner.]
;W[bm]C[* This is bad shape, White should extend if he wants to reinforce.]
;B[dq]C[Here I thought I was about to kill W's corner stones, but...

* Well, it is solid, and you get some nice influence to the bottom.]

(;W[cr]
(;B[dr]C[* Following your opponent?];W[ap]C[In my earlier reading, I missed the fact that W47 would be sente against the outside.
So what was a better alternative to B42?

* B42 is fine, although A5 is better. White's defending his corner hurt his other group, as you predicted. Black D2 was heavy.]
;B[ao];W[ar]MA[fp]C[Still, W lives small in gote,.

But the marked B stone is clearly very inefficient.  What earlier mistake caused this?

* D2, and to a lesser extent, A6.];B[ej]C[I was still thinking of a leaning attack against
W's upper three stones, simultaneously starting to build a large region

* This is an important move, because Black's shape is weak.]
;W[ek]
(;B[fk]C[* This looks questionable to me. You help white to reinforce by attaching -  contact moves are for defense.

* If you do not want the opponent to reinforce somewhere, then put the focus elsewhere.]
;W[el]
(;B[fl]C[* This is pushing from behind, not good either. Where else to play?]
;W[em];B[fm];W[bi]C[Building outer thickness, I thought.

* White is just trying to live. This is not bad for you, but you could have chased that group, rather than enclosing it. A running group gives lots of opportunity to drive the flow of the game.]
;B[bh]C[* Is this really useful? If you cannot kill now, then you just gave up sente. To me, White can make two eyes.

* Following the opponent ?];W[fn];B[gn]C[* You follow your opponent again. There are bigger moves on the board.]
;W[fo];B[go];W[fj]C[It's a ladder, so not worried, I thought.

* When you think ladder, you should always think ladder-breaker :)]
;B[gj];W[lc]
(;B[mc]LB[fj:a]MA[nd][pd]C[I was not trying to make territory behind the two marked stones -- I thought I was creating another weak W group to chase.  I completely overlooked that W had placed a ladder-breaker!

 I stopped keeping a record at this point.

Because the W stone at A could now break loose, a capturing race developed between B's side stones around C12  and a growing group  of W stones.  But B won that battle, though in gote , so that W could play on the the lower side, and make B's wall look useless.

Though B still won the game, I am confident that B has much room for improvement...

Did I miss some chance to take sente (up to move 66) and play on the right side, or
on the bottom?

Thank you for your comments and suggestions.])
