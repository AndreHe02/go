;W[cc];B[hg]MA[gf][gg]C[This was correct direction to go. It`s ok, it can be beter if it was more agressive.
For example like G4,G3.];W[cf];B[fh]MA[dg][eg]C[There is many strategis in Go. In larger boards thees strategies has great impact to the game, but in smaller boards like this, the clue to victory is agression and small battles. This move is great for defence, but it does not mutch for attack.  Be more braver while you learning and try mooves like E3 or D3. Try to play game for victory, not to defence. You will loose many times, but when it comes to first victory, oh man, that is the feeling! :)]
;W[dh];B[ec]MA[ge][he]C[I'm unsure of this move, would something like E8 or E6 be better?

It is ok. You will also whant to connect the upper and lower stone groups in G5 or H5 as soon as possible, because now white can cut you in half.

p.s.
In board 19X19 some one told me, the 4`th line is for influence and 3`d is for territory. Remember that! it`s usefull.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[ef];B[fe]C[I was also unsure of this move, but I read that the mouse shape was good to make.

good move];W[ea];B[fa];W[da];B[fb];W[dc];B[dd];W[cd];B[ed]MA[ee]
C[Better at E5. if you go E5 than you will probably gained 1 point more]
;W[eh];B[fg]C[How was this move? Would F1 have been better?

in this scenario this move to F3 was best.
Remember: your best move is your opponents best move!

p.s.
F1 is bad move! better E1 if you want to go there.];W[fi];B[gi]
