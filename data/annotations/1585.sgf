C[review by adum 3k*
reviewee was playing black

the number one general comment i'd make would be to make sure that your moves are either big, crucial, or sente. there are several times when you play two or three-point moves that have no effect on your opponent. eliminating these moves from your games will make a big difference. good luck!]

;B[pf];W[jc]C[note that the black stones in the upper left want to develop towards the right. but now white has a low, secure group there, so their potential is limited.]

;W[ch]
(;B[cg];W[bh]
(;B[ng]C[From now, my "strategy" (if it can be called such) was to put pressure downwards (to my wall) :

- on the  Q12 group, but in order to strengthen against upper W moyo
- on the B12 C10 group

Any idea I should have had instead ?

---------------------------------------

first, white's Q12 group is completely invulnerable due to the R9 stones. there's no way you're cutting R12 off from R9, so pressuring these guys is not going to happen with O13.

i'm not sure what you mean by W's upper moyo. there is no W moyo on the board, and certainly not around M17.

however, your idea about putting pressure on the C10 group is a good one. right now that group has one gote eye on the side, so it's definitely possible to attack it.

you have a weak group too, however. the C9 stones can easily be attacked by white. i would make it a goal at this point to try to strengthen these guys by attacking the white stones above them.

another possible goal is pressuring K17 while building territory in the upper left, with a move like J15.]

B(accounted for the B12 monkey jump
about the same for W

------------------------

is the black group on the left alive? doesn't look like it. white should kill that and game is over.]

(;W[jj];B[ih]C[O2 probably needed to be played ...
I was thinking of it at this time

------------

O2 is big, yes, but not sente. without the Q7 exchange, O2 might be sente because of white's bad aji

this is an unusual peep. probably peeping from the other side makes more territory, if you do want to peep]
