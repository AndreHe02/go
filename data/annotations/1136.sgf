C[Hi My name is Slawek Piela I come form Poland.
This game was fairy close up to the move 245 which was  a stuppid blunder on my part.   I marked moves I would appreciate comment on (other comments are certainly more than welcome).

Thanks in advance for your time.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qo];B[op]
;W[ql];B[kq]LB[qp:A][qj:B]C[Is there a dander of invasion at N3?
---
Theoretically perhaps.

However, if white invades now the result will be horrible for
white so white won't do that.

L3 is playable here and is probably a joseki.
For example, M3 is inferior because it concentrates
your stones too much in the beginning. N3 would be
of course totally awful.
Other possibilities are for example R4 [a\] to
secure the corner and pressurize the white group, or
R10 [b\] to attack the white group immediately and inhibit
it from developing upwards. K3 is also very plausible and
is faster than L3.];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[gc]
;B[cj];W[qf];B[qi]TR[pd][qi]LB[kc:A]C[I wouldn't probably play a pincer here.

A rule of thumb says that play pincer when you already
have an extension, otherwise not.  That is, if you had
a black stone around L17 [a\] pincer would be more effective.
Now you are in the danger of creating two weak groups
(marked stones) during fuseki which is considered bad.

The pincer stone is weakened by the white group below
which is not so weak.]
(;W[rd]LB[of:A]C[White could have jumped out to P14 [a\] to separate
the two black groups.  Black would probably defend
the corner, after which the R11 stone would start
to seem dubious.  See the variation.];B[pf]C[This attachment could harm the R11 stone.
Remember that attaching stones makes them strong!
Do you want the white group here to grow strong
and separate the R11 stone from other black stones?];W[pg];B[qe]
LB[of:A]C[I have doubts now about this move. White answered the way I expected but he probably didnt have to ...

It would be natural for white to atari at P14 [a\] first.];W[re]
;B[qg];W[rf]
(;B[og]LB[ph:A]C[Why not play this atari at Q12 [a\]?

See the variation.

I consider this to be a bad move.];W[ph];B[oh];W[pi];B[oe];W[pc]
C[It would be more urgent for white to play the big point
near L17 to erase black's influence here.
Black would look overconcentrated.];B[oc];W[pb];B[jc];W[cn]

(;B[cq]TR[cn]C[In this situation black cannot expect
to live unconditionally.  The C6 stone (marked)
makes it necessary for black to play ko here.
See the variation in the next node.

Here D3 is common.  See the variation here.

Anyway, invading the corner could be premature here.
If you succeedin living, white gets massive thickness
outside, terribly limiting black's potential on the bottom.]
;W[dq]
(;B[bp]C[D2 should be probably played here.
See the variation.];W[bo]LB[cr:A]C[I think white should have played C2 [a\].]
;B[br];W[dr]
(;B[cr]C[Would A3 make the corner alive?
Anyway what was the proper way to invade (my objective was to live in the corner)
---
See the previous comments.  To live in the korner should require a ko.
But you don't need to live in the corner.  One option is to threat
to invade the corner and then actually take territory on the
bottom.  The D3 play is not as strong invasion as C3 because
white can still get the corner, but in exchange black gets
nice shape towards right.

Regarding A3, see the variation.];W[aq];B[hq];W[cp]C[Probably a wasted move.
I can't see a way to escape or live even
before C4.];B[oi];W[pj];B[qp];W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[ge];W[ob]
;B[nc];W[je];B[fc];W[ec]LB[fb:A]C[Bad move.  White should try to keep the G17 stone connected
because that would help the K15 stone also,
which is floating in the sphere of black's influence.
Underneath hane at F18 [a\] would be natural instead
of the text play.];B[fb];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ff];W[ed];B[hc]
C[This result is very bad for white.   Black played well and white stumbled.
The K15 stone is helpless and the G17 stone was
completely wasted.];W[eb];B[gb]LB[on:A]C[At this point I was affraid of W R15 escaping and leaving me with no territory in the middle which seemed to be my only hope .  Thats why I cut the ikken tobi that followed but it looks like I didnt get the most of my framework...
---
Let's count.

White's upper left corner: 15 points.
White's right territory, including upper corner: 40 points.
White's lower left corner: 20 points.

Black's bottom territory: 30 points.
Black's territory at the top: perhaps 20 points.
Black's territory on the left: 15 points.

So it looks like 75(white) agains 65 (black), when we didn't
count at all the potential territory around K15, and not the fact
that if black gets to play P6 [a\] before white, black's potential
on the bottom gets large.

Overall, black has much more influence towards center
and thus should win the game even if K15 would escape.];W[jg]
LB[gh:A]C[At this point, black's needs calm grand-scale judgement.
The most important things are:

1 - do not let the white group escape
2 - do not attack it too hastily so that you left
weaknesses behind

If the group does not escape, one of the following happens:
1 - the group dies
2 - it lives very small, and black gets huge profit.

I could start by playing at G12 [a\], both attacking the
white group on the large scale and claiming territory on the left.

Cutting at K14 (as happens next)
is premature.  As a result the white group
is likely to grow stronger.];B[jf];W[kf];B[if];W[le];B[kg];W[lg]

;W[nl];B[ok];W[ll]C[Any ideas for better handling this sequence (from move 81 on)?
---
Probably nothing significant.  The problem here is that
you tried to kill the white group too speedily, forcing
it to escape.  If you had surrounded it from a distance,
it would have had to live locally and would have had much
smaller effect overall.

As a bonus, living locally in the center is difficult and
white could have died still.];B[kk];W[ej]C[There goes my LC ...

Yes, of course you should have played one intersection

Then B8 would have been definitely an eye.];W[aj]C[There it goes.

Was there a way to pull it out ?
---
Yes, and an extremely simple and effective one.

Get back to move 241 and look at the comment.

Anyway, here playing at A13 gives seki.];B[ag];W[ai];B[ee]LB[bj:A]

Yes.

Curiously enough, if the left black group would have lived
the game would have been very close.
