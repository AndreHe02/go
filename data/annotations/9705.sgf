[ci:B]C[I would prefer to enclose the corner low at A (for better balancing with D7) or completing a base for the lower black group at B.
I think now something around C13 annoys black a bit]
(;W[ci]C[This is the best place I could see to invade

Pol:
I disagree, you can't extend anywhere to make a base with the group, but is a good invasion, i'ld prefer to invade around C13 as i said in the previous comment. Look variations]

Ok, here you have a chance to kill the group or at least try it but
things has to be done in a better way]
(;W[dr]C[Pol:
At some places this descent is good, here no because you're
inviting your opponent to play C2 that is bad for you, i'ld give atari at C2.]
;B[cr];W[aq];B[ar];W[bm];B[bn]LB[an:A]C[Atari at A now (it's free and covers your weaknesses)]

A now! It's sente! (see variation)]

A still sente! It'll help you fight!];W[dk];B[ek];W[dj];B[dg]
LB[gi:A]C[Jump at A is better]
(;W[fi]LB[gi:A]C[Pol:
Jump at A is Better in my opinion (see variation)];B[fj];W[gn]
LB[em:A]C[Pol:
nice move, it gives your group better expansion and constricts the black group, also aims cutting at A]
;B[hk];W[em];B[gi];W[fh];B[fm];W[el]C[Pol:
Now black is in trouble];B[gh];W[qf];B[fg];W[nc];B[nd];W[qc]
;B[oc];W[qd];B[mc];W[pj]LB[pe:A]C[Pol:
Nice point, also consider A];B[kq];W[mq]C[Pol:
Ok, this one is good for enclosing the corner, but keep in mind that this way you can't capture black stone.]
;B[ko];W[km];B[jm];W[kn]LB[jn:A]C[Pol:
Painful, you're hitting the head of 2 stones, better cut at A instead and let him hit his face]
;B[jn];W[jo];B[io];W[jp];B[kl]C[Pol:
here is the problem, now this really annoys you and black is starting to build territory in the middle almost at the same rate that is destroying yours]

;W[rg];B[pg];W[rf]LB[re:B][qi:A]C[Pol:
Bad Move, connecting in the second line! Better A or B (A better than B anyways]
;B[qi]LB[qh:B][qj:A]C[Pol:
Of course, now this is painful as hell, if you lost this game, this may be the losing move, black broke up into your territory.
If i were white, i would descent to A, to prevent further incursion and give up the stone at B]
;W[rh];B[pi];W[qj];B[ri];W[rj];B[lj];W[oi];B[oj];W[ok];B[nj]
;W[nk]C[Pol:
You managed the situation well and black didn't get the chance to break in your territory, but he build a nice framework at the top]

;B[ij];W[kf]C[I think I should have been able to live here.

Pol: Indeed, you built a nice shape, maybe this move at K14 would be better but's is a nice move]
;B[kd];W[ld];B[ke];W[je];B[le];W[lf];B[me];W[mh]C[Wonder it would not have been better to play J14 or K14

Pol:
Or also J13, yes better than this one, now you have a cutting point exposed]
;B[jf];W[jg];B[if];W[nh];B[oh];W[kg]LB[kh:A][lh:B][li:C]C[Pol:
A, B or C would've been made better shape for living, this one does not help you]
;B[ii];W[jh];B[mg]C[I think the white group should be dead after this move]
;W[mf];B[ng];W[ne];B[md];W[oe];B[pe];W[nf];B[qe]C[This was probably a mistake by black that, should have played Q14 and trapped the white group
Pol:
Yes! Your chance to reverse the game!];W[pf];B[og]LB[li:A]
(;W[lg]C[I miscounted the liberties of the black group and played too quickly (specifically T11). I thought this move put the black group in atari. This move probably threw away any chance I had to kill the black group and live. I should probably have rather moved on M12. This would have win the capture race.
Pol:
M11 is even better! With B at M12 is hard to comeback];B[lh]

C[White Resigned

Pol:
White underestimating its position! Still have a chance to won, he have a huge territory on the lower side and
also black can still make mistakes!
That was a nice game, i hope my revision helps you!])

Now you fleed successfully into the center and have nice points to attack (all letters marked are good points for white, of course black can't cover them all at once)]

Black lower grup is floating and probably will have to run to the center]
