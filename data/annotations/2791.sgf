C[Dear Reviewer,

here is the first game I (Aveneer) played after studying tsumego for a few hours. While I did feel like I made some progress regarding a few local moves, I'm still rather unhappy with the overall game. My guess is that this is due to my problems to figure out which global moves are the most urgent or profitable ones. While I will surely focus on practicing such tsumego from this time forward, any help you might be able to give me is very much appreciated.

Overall, I (white) lost the game by 0,5 Moku. I feel like this loss wasn't necessary since I felt satisfied about the game in the beginning.

I will add comments and thoughts at a couple of occasions, but overall I'm hoping for you to tell me my worst mistakes and, more importantly, to tell me how I can improve.

Thanks a lot in advance.

Yours,

Jan

*ok, let's start];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp]
;W[cq];B[cj]
(;W[dl]C[Here, I felt like black abandoned the basic joseki and that the jump to C10 is a bit too wide (I'm not sure though). Thats why I decided to attempt to gain some influence towards the center while attacking there.

*this is not an urgent move, i think; black is probably not going to close his mistake now so u could wait and do it later.
maybe is important a move at j3 or L3 or shimari P3. difficult to say which is the best.
About this attack i think u are building inluence on the center, but maybe is better C8 which threaten a disconnection. (remember that black can still connect)
(see var)];B[cl];W[dn]C[Maybe I should've attempted to connect D8 and D6 instead of leaving them like this. That would've given me a much more stable position and would've made the attack that breaks the wannabe-"wall" useless...

*yes, this is a weak formation. In fuseki moves like d7 are very small move but could be dangerous for black make tenuki (see var)]
;B[jd]SQ[dd][pd]C[*big move. this is sanrensei. Strong position]

(;W[qf]C[the direction is ok, but u r strenghtening black upper position maybe u should start to think about reducing it.]
;B[md];W[qi];B[nq]
(;W[oq]C[I found O3 a rather surprising move and wasn't sure how to react. I think P3 is a bad move as my stones will end up overconcentrated, but I'm still not certain how to respont. Q3 looks too passive to me. Maybe I should've extended to R7 instead of trying to get the whole corner.

*q3 i think is the best response (see var)
r7 is passive because u let him gain a bit of corner and extend to the middle of the lower side

P3 is an attaching move, u could have done this move if awhite stone is around L3. look at the sequence]

(;B[np];W[op]C[Overconcentration, and black gets a chance to make a nice jump to K3.]
;B[jq]C[*the black grop is difficult to kill now because he can build another base at h3 and has much open space above, so, i think, the best strategy is to gain territory while attaching it. (see var)]

;W[pr];B[pq];W[pp];B[ps];W[qr];B[ns];W[on]C[This is a good example of my standard mistake: I tend to believe that when I atari, the opponent automatically reacts by securing the stone...
*the black choice was good];B[nn]C[see var]
(;W[no]TR[dl][dn][ln][lo][dp][jp][kp]C[*u should have played in the left side now that u have a moyo in this zone, connecting d7. i think this move is also sente if black doesn't want u to destroy his left side]
;B[dk]C[(see var)]
(;W[mn];B[oo];W[om];B[no];W[nm];B[dm]C[Here I suddenly realized that my plan of building influence towards the center was effeciently disrupted. At this stage I began to have serious doubts whether I could still make it, and I guess my failure here was the deciding factor that made me loose the game.

Had I connected D6 and D8 earlier, I think the board would favor white at this stage.


*this was a good threat,destroy your moyo and build a strong influence in the upper left side (as u can see at the end). now u can only defend]
;W[em];B[el];W[eo];B[fm];W[en];B[gl];W[cf]C[*black can reduce your moyo both from above and below, so good choice not to defend it and play elsewhere]

(;B[gd]C[*strange answer, maybe it's an error but i can't figure how to punish it]
;W[cc]C[*strange joseki (the only reason for the 3-3 invasion is that u can't live in c14 position... but i think u could)]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[bd];B[be];W[eb];B[fc];W[ac]C[*b17 avoids problems]
;B[ce];W[fb];B[gb]C[*now i think black is far ahead.]
(;W[li]CR[hb][mb][hc][oc][qc][rd][of]C[*territorial move. i would have tried something in the upper side before starting the endgame or something like p14 that threathens the corner and the side(see var).Black has many weakness. your move is also good but answering it black could build a huge moyo

;B[kn];W[mm];B[nf];W[ng];B[of];W[og]C[At this stage I began to get a hope that I might make a come back. I believe Blacks move P14 was a mistake as it forced me to play a move I've been wanting to play without giving much back to B.

*black can't do much more in this zone and he is gaining territory in sente.]
;B[qe];W[rf]C[I think this was about the last chance to finally make an invasion on the upper part of the board. While I'm not sure if R17 would've worked out, I'd most likely have tried there. This move forced Black to play S15, thus making an invasion much more difficult. Besides of that, it didn't even give me much profit - had black played at S14 I could've defended with S13 without a problem and go out in sente.

*this enclosure is too good for black and the reason is maybe that u forgot s16 in joseki or did't move in that zone at move 68. now is difficult..maybe impossible for white make something in the corner]
;B[re];W[jh]C[Now I started to worry about black being able to turn some of that huge territory here into moku, so I started to reduce territory.

*u have been able to make a good reduction in center so black lost all is advantage.]

*you were lucky in the upper left corner and could have won simply by playing moves like s16 b2 or j2.
your come back was good, but in future u have to worry about your opponent's territory. the upper side is very large and u did't try to reduce it. remember that black played 3-4 stones on that side but they were all on the fourth line, u have much space to create a living group in second and third line.
Playing a good endgame can often worth 20-30 points and a victory between the higher kiu. so play sente.

Glad to help you.
Luca

P.S.
feel free to ask for further explanations also about sequences i didn't write down, you can meet me often on Kgs as "fonta".
