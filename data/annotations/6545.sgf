Dear reviewer. My name is Sanga, right now I'm KGS 1k, but I don't think I'm that strong at the moment.

In this game I played as black. I think I did quite good in the opening but did bad at middle stage. So I hope you pay more attention at the middle game.

I hope you can help me to improve my go.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd]

;W[gr];B[hr];W[go];B[hp];W[cq];B[fr];W[dr];B[cj]C[Here is my first question.

Here I try to make white wall ineffective, but I think maybe I should play one of the following.

could you please help me here?

klin: You can play at C11 or D11.];W[ed];B[gc];W[cc];B[dc];W[dd]
;B[ec];W[fc];B[fb];W[ce]C[I don't know the joseki here, but I think this is playable.

klin: This is playable, but may not be a good choice.  See my later comment. (Learning basic joseki is a neseccary step to improve.)]
;B[fd];W[bd];B[cg]C[klin: At this moment, C13 has no threat to the white corner.  That's one reason F18 was not a good choice.]
;W[pj];B[np];W[pn];B[pq];W[qq];B[oq];W[qr];B[kp]C[klin: L4 is to close to your own influence.  Could play at O7.  Also, with the existence of R2, the territory on the lower side is small.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[lc];B[le]C[At the beginning I wanted to play N17, w M16, then b K17, but I don't know why I played here...
what should I do here?

klin: O17, N18, or K17 is also possible.];W[ic];B[kd]C[klin: The B's attacking sequrnce let W live easily with large territory.  L16 could play at N18 or O17.]
;W[kc];B[id];W[jd];B[je];W[jc];B[hd];W[nb]C[klin: W O18 makes living and also is large.]
;B[qh]C[In retrospect, I think this move is a mistake, since it make white gains wall.

where should I play here?

klin: B has lost a lot territory on the top and has to gain some back. Q12 is playable.  The problems are the following up steps.]
;W[ph];B[qg]C[klin: R13 bad, should play at Q11.  If you can learn this kind of fighting procedure, you will improve your ranking.]
;W[pg];B[rf];W[pf];B[re];W[qi]C[klin: B gained too little.]
;B[kg]C[klin: L13 a meaingless move.];W[dh];B[ch];W[dj];B[di]
;W[ei];B[ci];W[ej];B[cm];W[dl];B[cl];W[dm];B[hm]C[Another bad move. the result is bad for me.

What should I do here?

klin: This move is OK.  But B5 sente, should play first.  Also, B play at O7 and O9 may get a sente.  After all that, then play H7.
No comment after this point.];W[in];B[hn];W[ho];B[im];W[jm]
