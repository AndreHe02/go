C[Hello and thanks for the review.  I played as black, and am looking for a few suggestions on how to approach playing stronger players.  Any comments are appreciated!  - Joe aka Funkybside


**** Hello, I'm a 1k on KGS.  All of my comments will begin with the ****.]
;B[pd];W[tt];B[pp];W[tt];B[dp];W[tt];B[dd];W[nq]
(;B[np]LB[jp:A]C[**** generally in handicap games, I prefer to use a wide pincer at A against the low approach to the hoshi.  See the variation.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[qf];B[nc]C[**** Again, I would prefer to pincer R14.  Especially with the formation in the bottom right.  O17 is a safe play, but I also think it lets W off too easy.]
;W[cn];B[co]C[**** unless there is a strong reason to play this, it is generally considered that C5 lets W off too easy because it helps him make good shape.]
;W[dn];B[fq];W[cf];B[lq]C[**** w's c14 is an invitation to invade that wide extension.  m3 is premature.]
;W[mq];B[pn]C[*jameswalsh*: After I play m3, I can cut at R5 (hence, M3 is bad.]
;W[hq]
(;B[fo]C[**** this is a wasted move.  it puts no pressure on h3 because now w can simply k3 if he wants.  also, f5 does not protect the corner any more than it was before.  in this situation, i would either play m4 to presure the 4 w stones or play k3 to keep the w groups separate.  also, k3 threatens to link up with f3, so w has to respond to keep you separate.  see variations.]
;W[fd];B[ee];W[cc];B[dc];W[db]C[Funkybside: e15 is ugly];B[eb]
C[*jameswalsh*: Better in 9 stone games.];W[bb]C[Funkybside: agreed]
;B[da];W[cb];B[cd]C[**** another wasted move.  f17 would be better for b.]
;W[bd]C[*jameswalsh*: C16 is "aji-keeshi" removes possibilities) makes white more solid, without doing anything for black.]
;B[df]C[**** this is not the proper way to supress.  This simply allows w to play at d13 and make his moyo deep.  d13 is a better place for b to play.]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[dh]C[**** see, now you are pushing w on the fourth line AND you are pushing from behind.  See the variation.]

(;B[hd]LB[jc:C][qh:B][dk:A][lp:D]C[**** this feels too concentrated.  you have a huge wall against 1 w stone.  it would be better to play somewhere else.  for example, at A, B, C, or D.]
;W[he];B[gd]LB[id:A]C[**** this is bad.  it is better to extend at A.  Makes more potential territory.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[ge];B[fc];W[ce];B[de];W[id];B[ic];W[jc];B[jd]
;W[ie];B[hb];W[kc];B[ke];W[hg];B[me]C[**** this move should be at m15.]
;W[le];B[ld];W[kd];B[lf];W[je];B[rd]C[*jameswalsh*: The dreaded ponuki, but in this case duplicative of your O17 and Q16 stones.


**** I disagree.the ponuki is has a lot of influence all along the right side of the board.  combined with q6 formation, b has a lot of promise on that side.]
;W[ql]C[Funkybside: you mean i'm heavy?];B[qi]C[*jameswalsh*: I mean that the usual power of a ponuki doesn't mean much here.


**** I don't like r11.  I think r10 would be better.  that would put more pressure on the r8 stone and allow a 1 space extension to r12 if you need it later.]
;W[oi];B[pg];W[qj];B[pi];W[pj];B[oh];W[ri];B[rh];W[rj];B[qg]
;W[fh];B[jb];W[fn];B[ip]LB[gn:A]C[**** this is a huge mistake.  you HAVE to hane at A.  W has a huge moyo that if he makes it any deeper, it will become solid territory.]
;W[hp];B[io]C[**** again, you have to hane at H5.];W[ho];B[in]
;W[eo];B[bo];W[mo];B[fp]C[**** this is unnecessary.  it is too small.  N6 is much more important.  also, this forces h6, which only makes w stronger.]
;W[hn];B[im];W[ik];B[hl]C[**** good.];W[hk];B[gl];W[il];B[lm]
LB[ei:A][em:B]C[**** i think it is more important to connect at h7.  you still have peeps at A and B to make life.]
;W[mm];B[ln];W[mn];B[eh];W[ei];B[fi]C[**** it is much more important to connect at H7.  F11 is not going to accomplish anything.]
;W[fg];B[ef];W[ec];B[ed];W[gf];B[ec];W[hm]C[**** this is huge.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[lk]C[**** again, a mistake.  if you are simply going to jump to m9, then why waste the move at b7?]
;W[ao];B[ap];W[an];B[bq];W[ll];B[kl];W[ml];B[kk];W[qo];B[qp]
;W[rp]C[Funkybside: bad shape, but what else];B[rq];W[ro];B[qr]
;W[po];B[op];W[nn];B[di];W[ej]
(;B[ci]C[**** w has a lot of vulnerabilities here.  this is not going to get you anywhere.  see the variation.]

;W[le]C[*jameswalsh*: I am glad to have D7. It stops a lot of Ko threats.
Funkybside: i see
Funkybside: i dont see anything big enough
Funkybside: not even close];B[md]C[*jameswalsh*: You didn't expect to win the KO, did you?]
;W[ke];B[ni]C[**** good.];W[oj];B[fj];W[ek];B[fk];W[fl]C[*jameswalsh*: E7 is well placed. Thanks.
Funkybside: :0)];B[or];W[ko];B[jq];W[jm]C[**** why quit here?  See the continuation.]
;B[jn]C[****b would be alive here.  See variations.]
(;W[kn];B[km];W[jl];B[lo])
(;W[km];B[kn];W[jl];B[lo];W[lp];B[kp];W[lr];B[kq]C[***** alive again.  no need to resign.]

;B[cl]C[**** b is alive i believe.];W[fm];B[cm];W[al];B[am]
;W[el];B[dl];W[fl];B[dk]C[**** there are a lot of places that you might trip up, but my point is that you should try to use the vulnerabilites of W to live.  Your play at C11 really does not accomplish much.  It is a throw-away move.]
))
(;AE[df][dg][eg][dh];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh]C[**** now you are pushing on the third line and you are ahead of w.  much better.]

(;AB[jq];W[ip];B[ko];W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[km];W[lr];B[kq];W[hn]
;B[fn]C[**** w now has two weak groups.  also, b is threatening to attack on the left side.  b has a lot of territory on the right side that he can make by attacking the o3 group.]

(;AB[lp];W[mo];B[lo];W[mn];B[go];W[ho];B[hn];W[io];B[ln]C[**** w is going to have a hard time.]

(;AB[jp];W[qn];B[oo];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[om];W[qm]LB[dj:A]C[**** something like this might be expected.  K4 is now ideally placed relative to D4 and if b gets to play at A, then he will have a great moyo.]
