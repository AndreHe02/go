C[Review request Graham Lamont (W)
qimfy 7k* 01/10/01

This was a .5 win for W.
This is fairly close game with long endgame.
What I am particularly interested in is comments on the way W handles invasions of his large moyos

This happens twice and the result is fairly poor for W each time.

I think the endgame was played ok by both players.

 Until B invaded my moyo each time I thought I was ahead.

Cheers qimfy

 qimfy 7k*: hi pleased to meet you enjoy the game!
 Xena 7k*: nice to meet you too!];B[qd];W[dd];B[pc]C[pem: Too slow, but not a major mistake. In the opening (almost) anything goes at amateur level. :)

qimfy:

Odd but solid ?

Xena:

I am trying a "provocative" style of play in this game. My idea is to take territory really solidly in some places, and to play very aggressively elsewhere. Besides, I did read somewhere that Ishida Yoshio assessed the loss incurred by this double 3-4 enclosure to be less than 1 point - and at this level I think any "loss" is balanced by surprise value and its virtually total lack of bad aji.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[jc];B[cj];W[nq];B[cn];W[dn];B[co];W[do];B[cp]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[cr]C[pem: Better to connect solidly at D3. This wouldn't leave the aji Black later exploited.]
;B[dm];W[em];B[dl]C[Xena;
Black gets quite a lot of probably profit on the side, whilst White gets a moyo. But the wall doesn't yet seem all that thick.]
;W[no]C[qimfy:

I am happy with this exchange.];B[pn]C[Xena:
I think Black has to do something here.];W[pr];B[qq]
(;W[nm]C[pem: I think maybe White's moyo is too thin, it needs a stone in the middle, so perhaps that's where White should play.

imfy:

Now I'm delighted.
Is it really ok for B to playthis way ?

Xena:
I think Black is in some danger in the lower right, but on the other hand, if I can handle Q8, then I do get sente for the very big keshi at k7.]
;B[jm]LB[gn:A]C[pem: Not deep enough. Given the width and the cutting points at D3 and E6, Black should be able to go deeper, at least one line. An alternative might be G6 for instance.]
;W[jo]C[pem: Well, since White was wide open to begin with, it's very hard to defend. K4 or J4 would probably have been better. The result would be the same as if White had played K4 instead of O7, and Black answering this with K7 instead of O7.
(See my previous comment about O7.)

qimfy:

k4 instead ?
This just *looks* so good for W

Please comment how B+W should play this. Thanks.

Xena:
When White tried to take fifth-line territory I could resist the chance to make trouble by invading and exploiting the holes at d3 and e6.]
;B[iq]C[pem: Given the aji here, this should be ok.

Xena:  Black can get either f3 or m3, whilst there is some aji of connecting outside. And if  I die, I'm not really much worse off than before.]
;W[hp];B[er]LB[gq:A][hq:B]C[pem: The first step to learn how to handle moyo invasions or reductions (for White in this case), is to have reasonable expectations. Don't expect it all to become territory. Try to keep 1/3 to 1/2 of the potential. You gain by forcing the opponent to spend lots of stone preventing you from getting it all, and making you strong and solid in the process. But if you try to keep it all, you'll end up with nothing.
In this case, consider the possibility to give up the C3 stones, and keeping the right part of the moyo. Maybe A or B would do it.
And even if Black lives on the edge, White can aim at isolating and attacking the K7 stones, thus expanding outwards instead.]
;W[fq];B[fr];W[eq];B[ip];W[hq]C[pem: Absolutely. Letting Black push through here is a disaster.

qimfy:

j5 instead ?];B[io];W[ho]MA[jn]C[pem: Hard to tell if White K6 would lead anywhere, but it's at least more interesting than H5, which seems small and aimless at this point.

qimfy:

W gives in now!
Accepts small  profit.. maybe try L6 for whole group ?]
(;B[jn]C[pem: J6 better (better aji and better shape).];W[ir]
;B[jr];W[hr];B[ko]C[pem: Well, White ended up with almost 1/3 of the moyo, so given its thinness, it's not that bad when he at least ends in sente.]
;W[pl]C[pem: Should be, it's very painful for Black.

qimfy:

Happy to get this point also];B[hn]C[pem: See previous comment about Black K6. And still, Black doesn't have time for this now. Now he takes gote twice, which is unacceptable.

qimfy:

vsmall ?

Xena:
I thought it was necessary to strenghen my shape here. But, I don't like the look of White R7 in this position, and so I think really R7 is an urgent point which had to have been played.]

(;W[qr]C[pem: Well, not quite. R7 gives a slightly better result for White, but Black can't answer at R6, he then has to play R2.

Xena:
R7 is better, since Black would have to answer, then White would have sente for this too.]
;B[qm];W[ql];B[rq];W[rl];B[rm]
(;W[cg]C[pem: It lives, but it's still a very bad result for Black, being pushed around to a small life in gote, where he should have gotten territory.

Xena:
I spent several moves worrying about White playing at S5, but while I still had S2 I thought Black could manage.]
;B[cc];W[dc]C[qimfy:

Block on long side];B[lc];W[kd]C[pem: No reason to play diagonal here. K16 or K15 are normal. After Black M16, White got bad shape.]

(;B[cd]
(;W[cb]C[pem: Unusual. See variation for one possible sequence.]
;B[bb];W[da]C[pem: Again, leaving unnecessary aji. Connect solidly at D18.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[ba];W[ac]C[qimfy:

Optimistic !];B[ab];W[bf];B[ad];W[ee]
(;B[qg]MA[he]C[pem: H15 is also possible, or perhaps H14.
But R13 is too close to the very solid corner, should be R12 instead.

qimfy:

Big point but what about h15 ?];W[ld]C[pem: Very good, since Black neglected M16 earlier. Now L16 became a good move.]
;B[he];W[hh]TR[cj][dl][qg]MA[hn][jm]C[pem: Why should it be possible to "get" Black's stone? With the marked stones around, it has plenty of ways to escape. White has to options; either accept the reduction and play G16 (and make sure to get sente for N17). But this may give Black a good potential in the center with the squared stones, so capping is the other option. (But don't expect to actually capture H15.) I would probably have capped with H13 instead, but it's hard to tell which is best.

qimfy:

This looks reasonable way to get Bs stone....
But clearly doesn't work


Pleaase...How should W play ?

Xena:  How about simply accepting the sacrifice with N17? Black might run away with H13 and then White gets H17.]
;B[hg];W[ig]MA[ih]C[pem: I think J13 is ok.

qimfy:

just j12 ?];B[gg];W[if];B[gh];W[hf];B[gf];W[ge];B[fe];W[gd]
;B[fd];W[gc]
(;B[mc]C[pem: Seems to me you actually agree. And, yes, this was good for Black.
But I think Black can simply connect at F14 first, White should answer that with F17.

qimfy:

And B manages to get sente for n17!!
Disaster.

Xena:
I disagree with my friend about the move h12. He tried to kill a keshi stone (H14) while I was prepared to sacrifice M17. Now his attack runs out of steam and now the top is much reduced while I get sente for n17.]
;W[ef]C[pem: Had White played D19 at D18, he could have played F14 now instead. (He still can, but now it's just a small gote.)]
;B[ff];W[dj];B[hi]C[pem: Simply answering at C9 seems natural.]

 qimfy 7k*: true
 Xena 7k*: it's been a good game. I thought I would win, but you hung in there.
 Xena 7k*: please will you move or pass
 qimfy 7k*: interesting thing is with PDAs could use similar counting technique.... would  that be legal in tournies
