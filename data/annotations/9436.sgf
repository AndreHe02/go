C[Hi and thanks for reviewing this game.  I played black.

In this game, my opponent easily repelled my attacks leaving me wondering if I was over-aggressive.

I've put some specific comments and questions in the SGF.  In general, would appreciate any advice on strategy and how I could better manage my influence/weak stones.

Hi, I am Kheng Hun, 2dan SG, and will be commenting on some parts of the game.

A final comment after looking through the game, black had several weak groups, one on the right side, one at the bottom, and one at the lower right corner. While white managed to attack two groups, white took good profit despite not killing. You could play more solidly and safely, jumping out earlier to let your stones have space to run and not get attacked. Don't be too rush in attacking, for example the white upper right corner, rather ensure the safety of your groups, then once your groups are strong enough, you can proceed to attack. Just try to find the time to run away before the groups are too weak and you would do fine. 

Regards,
Kheng Hun]

kh: the pincer position makes it tough to really attack m4 stone, but a move there is still important, around m6 or n6]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[ln];B[cn]C[I thought about S2 instead, but the lower right stones still have some space to make eyes (e.g. black can play M3) so it didn't seem urgent.

kh: if you think its alive, then go ahead and get bigger points, its fine.]

kh: when white has a 4-4 stone with 2 far extensions, 3-3 is usually good play, since it takes territory in sente]
