C[manckaert [12k\]: Hello
manckaert [12k\]: Have a good game
hmanners [13k\]: you too

Hi, I play as Numsgil on KGS.  Don't be afraid to hit me up for a (teaching or regular) game if I'm on.  I've marked comments as N:  There's a high level summary at the end.]
;B[dp];W[pq];B[dd];W[pd];B[po]
(;W[qp]SQ[pj][qj][qk][pk]C[N: This is a classic DDK mistake.  If you take one lesson from this game let it be this:

Don't kick stones (make a diagonal move to induce them to play a descent) unless by so doing you can overcontentrate them or rob them of eye space.  This does neither.  Black can build a bit of a wall and make an ideal extension to grab territory and base.

If you had a stone at any of the squares then this becomes a viable attack.  See variations.]
;B[qo]
(;W[ro]SQ[np][nq]C[N: No.  Having made the kick, you want to play at one of the squares.  This sort of move is an end game move.  Against weaker players you can usually get it in just fine, but if you start playing stronger players and make moves on the second line like this that don't really threaten to kill anything or save anything, your opponent will take large points elsewhere on the board.]
;B[rn];W[sp]C[N: Again.  You're playing a gote move on the first line.  There has _got_ to be better moves out there.  I would say this move here is your first really fatal mistake.  The others were ones of efficiency.]
(;B[op]C[N: A wee bit lax.  See variation]
(;W[nq]C[I felt that P3 would be quite slow so I choose to jump out.

N: See the variations around here.  I don't think this is a good idea just yet.

Certainly pushing once and then jumping out isn't going to cost you that many points.  Better to play sure and steady until you're in the dans (that is, get comfortable with the fundamentals before you try to get fancy).]
;B[oq]C[N: Black could also leave this as aji.  It's not an urgent attack, and it wastes a bit of aji depending on what black intends to do.]
;W[or]C[N: Yes, this is the only move at this point.  As you get stronger you'll be tempted to try fancier things.  Don't give in to that temptation.]
(;B[pp]C[N: Oops, this is silly of black.  White doesn't want to play here, because he makes an empty triangle if he does.  So why is black taking what no one wants?  See variations.]
;W[qr]C[N: Yes];B[mp]C[N: Black is saying he wants a huge wall facing the right side.

BUT!  Does this move threaten you?  Maybe black can seal you in, but white's corner is getting pretty large at this point.

You know what ruins a wall?  Being built in gote.  Take sente and ruin his wall by taking the ideal extension he wants to make.]
(;W[kq]C[N: Looks like an overplay but I don't see an easy way to prevent it from connecting to the corner.  But what are you really after here?  You're still being pressed low on this side, while black is building his wall.]
;B[qf]C[N: Yes, black needs a move to make his wall meaningful.  I would prefer R10 but this works too.]
(;W[qc]C[N: Way too passive.  See variations.];B[of];W[qh]SQ[mo]
[mn][mm][nm][nl][nk][nj][ni][oi][oh][og]C[N: Too late really.  Black has the square sector line that white is now deep deep inside.  Which means this was an invasion.  It's too early in the game for this sort of deep invasion.

Even if white lives here, black will end up with massive center facing influence.  You don't want to give black that until you have some living groups of your own to counter it.]
;B[pj];W[qj];B[qk];W[sn];B[sm];W[rm]C[Should have connected here or not have played T6 in the first place.

N: Yeah.  Although if you really wanted you could start a ko.  Black would have to give you 3 moves in a row elsewhere on the board to eliminate the full ko (it's a multi stage ko).  It's a bit early for a ko though, so I'm not sure what black would do.]
;B[so];W[rk];B[rp];W[qq];B[rl];W[qm];B[rj];W[qi];B[pi];W[rf]
C[Is there a way to try and connect my upper right group and the group below it?

N: If there is this is the right start.];B[rg]
(;W[re]C[N: See variation for the trick.  This is obviously not the trick.  This _is_ an endgame tesuji, though (attach under, then retreat).]
;B[qg];W[ph];B[oh];W[pg];B[og];W[pf];B[pe];W[qe];B[oe];W[rh]
C[Not bad if I say so myself?

N: Yes, nicely salvaged if you valued those stones.  Black has an enormous wall now, though, facing a huge undeveloped area.  And he made it in sente, so he can probably make a good extension and start developing a huge moyo.  So you saved your stones, but at what cost?]
(;B[om]C[N: Black is thinking way too small.];W[nc]SQ[ic][jc]
[kc][kd][jd][id][cj][dj][cf][fc][cn][fq]C[N: Not bad, but you really need to do something about black's potential moyo, and this is not that move.  I'm really not sure what you need to be doing at this point.  Find an open area and plonck a stone down there.  Any of squares would probably be a good idea.]
;B[md]C[N: A bit over contentrated for black, but not unreasonable.]
(;W[lc]C[N: No.  Get out of this habit right now.  Here's the rule: you may only jump if you're jumping from a group with 6 liberties (diagonal connections and tigers mouths can be treated as solid connections for this).  Your lone stone has 4 liberties.  So you need to push.

Why 6 liberties?  There's all sorts of bad lines of plays that aren't as terrible or don't work if you have 6 liberties.  It's like not wearing your seat belt.  Even if you don't crash, it was an unnecessary risk.  6 liberties is the seat belt you need for a one point jump.

Unfortunately that means if you must play here you're just going to be helping black's wall grow and surround some real territory.  So don't play here!  Tenuki somewhere else on the board.]
;B[ld];W[kc];B[jd];W[np];B[no];W[mo]C[N: Yes, very important: if you push at O4, you _must_ cut.  Otherwise the push just helps black.]
;B[lp]
(;W[lo]C[N: Oops, you're running black in to your weak stone.  This is called a "family feud".  Don't do this.]
;B[kp];W[jq];B[jp];W[nn]C[N: This exchange is questionable if you don't play N7 right after.  You just help black strengthen himself, but you can be easily cut.

Even if you're trying to play lightly, I think this is questionable.]
;B[oo];W[ql];B[sk];W[pk]C[This will turn out to be very good later on. At the moment I didn't really have a plan.]
;B[rk];W[on]SQ[mn]C[N: This is a risky line of play with an unprotected cut at square.]
;B[nm];W[ok]C[N: A new risky cut.  But maybe you're trying to play lightly.]
;B[nj];W[pm]C[N: Wouldn't Q6 be better?];B[mn];W[pn];B[ln];W[mm]
;B[nl];W[nk];B[ml];W[mk];B[kl]C[N: Black would be better off just extending.]
;W[lm];B[ll];W[kn];B[jn]C[N: Black sort of fudged that line of play, but he still has good prospects at a center moyo, and your white group is still weak without a solid two eyes.]
;W[cq]SQ[cj]C[N: I think you'd be better off playing the wedge at square.]
;B[mn];W[ln]C[N:  Oops, now you're down to 0 eyes again.]
(;B[lj]C[N: too tight.  White can rip this to shreds];W[mj]
;B[mi];W[oj];B[oi];W[ni];B[nh];W[lk];B[kj];W[jm];B[km];W[jo]
;B[in];W[kk];B[jl];W[jk];B[il];W[ik];B[gl]C[N: Generally one point jumps like this don't work well in the center of the board.]
;W[cf];B[gi]C[N: Black is getting the idea now.  You're going to have a hard time living with this center dragon.  Even if you do live, black gets profit (a solid wall) while you get very little.]
;W[ii];B[ig];W[hh]
(;B[gg]C[N: No, too tight.];W[hg];B[hf];W[gh];B[fh];W[gf];B[fg]
;W[if];B[he];W[jg];B[ie];W[jf];B[hi];W[ih];B[kf];W[li];B[ki]
;W[lh];B[kh];W[kg];B[nj]C[N: Yeah, I don't know what black thinks he's doing.  His troubles came from playing too tight before.  He's royally botched this whole center area.]
;W[ke]C[Wrong move, should have connected at M13.

N: Yes.];B[lg];W[lf];B[mh];W[hj];B[gj];W[hk];B[hl]C[If he blocked me off at L16 my entire center group would be in much bigger trouble. I didn't realise it untill he made this move.

N: Yes, lucky break.];W[kd];B[mc];W[mb];B[oc];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb]
;B[od];W[qd];B[nd];W[nb];B[mf]C[N: Unfortunately black needs this for life.  Black's prospects for points are looking weak.]
;W[cc];B[io]C[N: I guess black is trying to protect his cutting points.  Really, though, now is not the time to be playing conservatively.  Black needs points.]
;W[hq]C[N: Remember the corners.  Those are way bigger.];B[qn]
;W[mn];B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb]
;W[fc];B[ed]SQ[bd]C[From the variation below I think it's quite hard to try and kill his group here, cutting it off from the rest would be possible.

N: Yes, white either lives in teh corner or gets side profit.  There is a joseki that sort of goes like this but I don't think it works if you made the square hane first.

Black should be aiming for a wall facing the left side, and hope he can form it in to territory.]
(;W[gb];B[fd];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc];B[hd]C[N: Black, you wer already connected!]
;W[ic];B[jc]C[N: Black, there are bigger points!];W[jb];B[cp]
C[N: Finally.  Really either of you could have made a move down here much earlier.  It's absolutely ginormous it's so big.]
(;W[bp]C[N: Generally the joseki would have you move at D3 first.]
;B[bo];W[br];B[dq];W[dr]
(;B[eq];W[er]C[The variation below would be better for him, correct?]
(;B[gp]C[N: Locally this is definitely wrong.  He should just keep pushing on the third line and force you to crawl.

Globally, though, he's trying to build up a larger territory on the left.  But it's not quite enough I think.]

;W[rr];B[hp];W[ch];B[cj];W[cl];B[bj];W[ek]
(;B[dj]C[N: Black is playing like he doesn't have a massive wall for a ceiling.    Black can play loose and just run for the ceiling when he gets in trouble.

In a high level game, players for either side would probably not find a way to live with white.]
;W[ej];B[di];W[ei];B[dh];W[gk];B[fk]C[Here I focussed at killing the group at G11, but  I could have gotten more out of cutting off his group on the left, see variation?]

[ro][ep][np][sp]C[Thank you for your review.

manckaert [12k\]: Thank you

N: To sum up some ideas:

1.  You favor territory over influence.  At DDK, most players don't know how to use influence anyway, so that probably makes sense.  But as you play stronger opponents, be very wary of grabbing only territory.  You need a mix of solid territory and center facing influence.

2.  Be careful when the game turns in to a large scale tactical brawl that you keep an eye on the big picture.  You don't want to accidentally force your opponent to make a massive center territory.  It's especially easy to do if you grab only territory, since by process of elimination your opponent must have a massive center moyo.

3.  Don't form weak groups if the game is still close.  At best you'll force your opponent to form thickness and live in gote.  At worst you'll lose a group and die spectacularly.  Usually a reducing move is better (play right on the border of a moyo).  There were at least two times you formed weak stones and just sort of winged it and got lucky.  That won't always work (though it can cary you up to the dan ranks if you're a strong tactical fighter), so it's a strategy best reserved for when you're losing on the board and need to play a bit more desperately.

Hope that was helpful.])

(;W[dl];B[el];W[fi]C[N: Check again, white's group there is in atari and it's black's turn.]
)
(;W[fl];B[el];W[fj];B[fi]SQ[fk]C[N: White's group is in atari again.  Black at square and you're dead.

But if you connect, you've managed to reduce black's territory by quite a bit.]

(;W[pf]C[N: When this works, this is the magic.];B[pg];W[qg]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[pf];W[re]C[N: Not sure if that's optimal play for black but that's the idea.  You threaten to connect under, then feint and threaten to connect over instead.  It doesn't always work though.  So make sure to read it out.  Here I think white is (barely) able to connect.]
))
(;W[qd]SQ[rd]C[N: If you insist on taking corner territory, this or one lower at square (though this is preferred over square until dan level play) grabs the corner.]
)
(;W[qh]C[N: A pincer here would be appropriate.  If black counter pincers it gets complicated, but you can probably attack R14 in profit in some way.  If black jumps in to the corner, he ends in gote and you can grab an extension here and suddenly black's wall is overcontentrated.]
;B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[pe];B[rf];W[og]SQ[pe][qh]C[N: Something like this probably.  The square stones form good shape (I like to think of it as the boomarang shape).]
))
(;W[qj]C[N: This is the ideal extension for black's wall (there's a defect so we subtract a point).  It's also the ideal extension for white's star stone.  Black's wall is now basically pretty worthless.  He can try to invade behind your stone here, but you're far enough away from black's wall that he's going to have a hard time making much profit.]
))
(;B[pr]C[N: "Cut on the side you don't want" is a proverb that applies in this position.  Please Mr. White, can I have some outside thickness to work with my star stone?]
(;W[qr]C[N: This would be the standard response if you end up this far.]
;B[nr];W[ps];B[mq]C[N: This is a possible continuation.  White is now locked in to the corner.  This is bad for white.  I would go so far as to say horrible for white.  He's not in danger of dying, but black has influence radiating across the entire board.  Black's influence and thickness here is truly scary.

If white wants to win the game from here he's going to have to play very very well.]
)
(;W[nr]C[N: You can try to resist, but then your corner starts looking very dead.]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[pp];W[ps];B[rp]C[N: Not a great result for white.]
))
(;B[nr]C[N: What happens if black decies he wants the corner?]
;W[mr];B[pr];W[ns];B[qq]C[N:];W[qr];B[pp];W[ps];B[pq]C[N: The result favors black, but it's hardly a resounding success.  Cutting on the other side to gain outside influence is preferable.]
))
(;W[oq];B[np];W[mq]C[N: This is solid for white.  Black will probably take sente to make an extension from his wall and haveit mean something (you should always build walls in sente).]
;B[qj]C[N: This would be the safe extension distance.  How can you tell?  Take the wall's height off the edge (in this case 6), and do that many spaces as a jump from the top stone of the wall.

There's a competing rule where you take the number of stones in a wall and do that + 1 as a jump.  Which also works, but only if you know to ignore stones on the first and second lines.  The rule I give above is easier to work with in practice.

Anyway, in this position white has 15 points or so in the corner.  Black's thickness is hard to count, but my guess is that it's worth more than 15 points.  Black has won this side encounter by a bit of a margin.  Nothing game ending, though.]
))
(;B[oq]C[N: This would probably seal white in to the corner.  White ends up with very little territory and no ability to influence the rest of the game.  Very bad for white.

I'm not 100% certain that white can't escape, but it's going to certainly be quite difficult.]
))
(;W[nq];B[qk]C[N: This would be the usual continuation.  This position is roughly equal for either player.  But white had the corner first, so white should expect more.]
))
(;AW[qj];W[qp];B[qo];W[nq];B[ql]C[N: Black is a bit cramped now (overconcentrated).]
))
