C[Hello. :-)

I am a European 2d, calling myself HonFu in the GTL and other go places. 

From this game record, I get a strong feeling, that you have no real idea of the value of moves, and that you have trouble estimating a position. From this weakness, a lot of other difficulties arise, like wrong decision in fights and wrong assumptions about the status of the game. But let us jump in and take a look at it, shall we?]
;B[qq];W[qe];B[dd];W[dp];B[jj]C[*Hon* You tried a historic opening here. ;-)]
;W[pj];B[jd];W[qo];B[oq];W[oo];B[mp];W[mn];B[od];W[pc]
(;B[og];W[qg];B[dj]
(;W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[df]
(;W[ff];B[hc];W[he]C[Black to play - it feels like I'm quite a way ahead at this point - and yet I still lost badly.

*Hon* Why should you be ahead? Normally a game of go is balanced, and noone is ahead. You can only get ahead, if your opponent makes a mistake. But White's moves were all rather normal, weren't they? Two empty corners, extension along the side, guarding the connection ... and then, when you got a large influence zone, he went in to reduce it. White's handling of the invasion was not perfect - but then you forgot to block in the upper right. I think it is still unclear, who is ahead!

Maybe you get confused by the appearance of influence? Let us look at this very rationally: How many points does White have? I think it is realistic to assume 30 points on the right side. The stone in the lower corner will do something - so let's say 5. 35 Points. What do you have so far? Not so much actually! Only the lower right can be called territory, that is about 10 points. The rest is only influence - at least for now. So if anyone is ahead, it must be White!

But you are in control of a fight right now, so we can't jump to conclusions. Let' just say, that it is still not clear who is dominating. It depends a lot on how this fight here develops.]

(;B[fb]C[Ajikashi?

*Hon* I think, you mean ajikeshi? It means "destruction of potential", like for example if you peep somewhere and solidify the opponent's stones, although you might want to cut him later. The term doesn't fit into this situation.

Let us think what this is about. You have an influence zone, and White has just entered and created a weak group. Your aim should now be to attack this group in a profitable way. This move here doesn't attack very well. It doesn't threaten White's eyes, because here at the edge, he had no eye potential to start with. You are only solidifying a bit of corner territory ...]
;W[gb];B[eb];W[gc]TR[hc]C[*Hon* ... and even pay a price for it, because your marked stone gets damaged in the process. 

I would say, instead of weakening White, you have rather strengthened him!]

(;B[hb]C[Thought connecting under was big - in hindsight probably too small.

*Hon* This is another wrong conception. Crossing under is very rarely a "big" move; rather it can be an "urgent" move, meaning to defend a group. In this case, you don't have to defend yourself so much, because you have enough buddies around; rather you want to attack White, so a defence measure is not called for!]
;W[hd];B[ga]TR[fa][ha][ia][ib]C[*Hon* So you crossed under. But how many points did you make? Even if White couldn't cut now, it would only be about the marked 4 points. How can that be big?]

(;W[ic];B[ib];W[jc]TR[jd]C[*Hon* And you are even paying for that almost worthless connection, weakening your marked stone.]
;B[id];W[jb];B[ha];W[kd];B[if]C[*Hon* Now you are doing what you should have been doing from the start: Attack the weak group.]

(;W[ke];B[jf]
(;W[oc]TR[gb][fc][gc][fd][hd][he][ff]C[*Hon* Ouch! This is so big! 

Okay, so by crossing under, how many points have you made there? Look at it: Not a single one! So the bigness of crossing under ended up being zero!

You still can profit, though, by killing the marked stones, which are very much in danger now. But they were in danger in the first place, it is not the merit of the crossing-under-operation.]
;B[nc]LB[kc:A]C[Was aiming at the cut at A, but this was bad. Not sure the best way to use the aji though.

*Hon* A third misconception: You must not think about a few stones. Always look for a way to attack the whole group!]

(;W[lc]
(;B[nb];W[ne]
(;B[me]C[*Hon* This looks like an overplay.];W[nd];B[md];W[mc]
C[*Hon* White just cuts. Not only is the attack over, White has "invented" points at the top.]
;B[qd];W[pd];B[oe];W[nf];B[pe]C[Misread by both players,]
(;W[qc];B[ng];W[mf];B[mg];W[lf];B[qf];W[rd];B[pg];W[rf];B[qh]
LB[qk:C][ql:B][qm:A]C[Willing to lose a stone or two around here if I can get thickness to invade around ABC

*Hon* The idea is very good - but then you don't follow up on it.]
;W[pf]C[*Hon* White threatens three of your stones. So how important are they? They do not threaten an enemy group, they don't help making your own stones live. It is really just the 6 points, and nothing more. This is exactly what you wanted to sacrifice!]
;B[of]TR[nb][nc]C[*Hon* But still you connect.

In a way, this is the same mistake as threatening only a few stones. Just like it is not worth attacking only two or three stones (you should attack the whole group!), it is not worth defending only two or three stones. You can save that for the endgame.

The marked two stones, though, they were very important! Because if they had lived, White's top middle group would have been weak; after your two stones died, they were strong immediately. So if stones play a crucial role in the matter of life and death, then they are important, even if it is only one. But if they play no role except the value of the stones themselves, then you may well throw them away, sometimes even five, six, seven or more stones.]

(;W[lg]C[*Hon* White comes out here.];B[rg];W[qf];B[pi];W[qj]
;B[oj];W[ok];B[nj]C[*Hon* But it was a bit hard to hope for an invasion there anyway, because your own stones were weak.]
;W[hf]TR[id][jd][if][jf]C[*Hon* And somehow you missed your chance to put hard pressure on these stones. 

After White has become strong to the right side, your marked stones become a target of attack, which White can use to survive with his own weak stones.]
;B[ih];W[dg]
(;B[ef];W[eg];B[fg]TR[id][jd][if][jf][ih][jj]C[*Hon* This is quite a strict measure, but for this kind of hard attack, you need strength in the surroundings. But the marked group seems to have some thinness.]

(;W[gg];B[fh];W[gh]
(;B[fe];W[gf];B[ed]C[Thought it was sente but too small.

(;W[fn];B[gj];W[gi];B[dm];W[dn];B[gl]C[Sabaki? I thought if it lived or escaped, I should be ahead

*Hon* Did you just "feel" it or actually count? I think, if you live here, the game will be close.]

(;W[bj];B[kf];W[le];B[bi];W[ji];B[jh];W[bj];B[am];W[bn];B[bi]
;W[en];B[dl];W[bj];B[gp]C[Too small. Given that white can't really afford to answer many threats is there anything bigger or was this just bad to start with?

*Hon* If we consider that White did not have too many points in this area, it was definitely bad to start this all-or-nothing ko. If White loses it, he will not risk anything. If you lose the ko, you lose your whole 40 points. So the burden is all on you.

Japanese call this a "hanami ko" - a picnic ko. Because White is actually enjoying this - it is only trouble for you!]

(;W[ck];B[hp]C[*Hon* Anyway, so what's the score? White has almost 90, including his prisoners. And Black? Not even 50.

So this game is clearly over. I mentioned a few things, but a lot of them actually seem to be related to the same weakness: Your estimation skills!

You saw yourself ahead early, although there was no indicator for it; you attacked small chains of stones, that were hardly worth it; you gave up sente for no value; you seem to have been a bit clueless of how the score is at all, right up to the end where you played on quite long in a totally hopeless position.

I think, that is absolutely not unnormal for your level, but to become stronger, you definitely need to overcome this! 

Luckily, estimating the score and the value of moves is actually easier than most other things in go. Learning to read out life and death situations? You have to train with problems really hard and for a long time to be able to do it well. Playing the opening well? You have to master hundreds of joseki and understand all the strategic implications of them. Compared to challenges like that, learning to count and to evaluating moves is comparatively easy.

I want to recommend you a few books about the topic, as a starting point:

Cho Chikun: "Positional Judgment"
James Davies: "The Endgame"

Probably what happened in this game is not all about the counting, but about other things as well, like reading, fighting and so on. So I want to at least recommend one good book, which will go a long way giving you a better feeling of what to do next:

James Davies: "Attack and Defence"

So ... I hoped this helped you some. Good luck with your go!]

But in the process, you made a present to your opponent: The ten points around the triangles in the lower left. Your profit is down to 14 points.
