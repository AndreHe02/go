C[GoRival [9k\]: kk

Hi I am David Bird, I will be reviewing this game.  I'm around 4k on KGS.   My comments will be marked by  "DB:"

Both white and black ignored urgent moves in the fuseki and the middle game.
I have tried to make good use of the "three questions" that 6d Lance Kemper ('Shygost' on KGS) teaches his students.  See move 7 for these questions.]
;B[pd]C[Black: Please comment on my Fuseki];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp]
;B[eq];W[dn]LB[cl:D][cq:A][hq:B][iq:C]TR[fo]C[DB: How to respond to this?  Well, my teacher tells me that we should focus on principles to guide us.  

One principle that black violated by playing at the marked position is where to play in the opening.  
We think about corners first, then side, then centre.  To play along the side or the centre, the move should be along the 3rd (3 rows from any edge) or 4th (4 rows from any edge).  Anything higher, like the 5th line here, is only in the centre.  So black chose a slow move here.

A, B, C, and D are joseki.  A is most common I think.  And the simple joseki works nicely for black's Q3 stone I think.]

(;B[fo]C[DB: It looks like black wants to develop the bottom side, but there is nothing here, as white demonstrated.]
;W[kq]LB[eq:A]C[DB: white can settle easily here

Now is a good time to introduce the three questions that my teacher advises us to follow:

1.  Do I have any weak groups?   If yes, then help the weakest group.  If no, then next question
2.  Does white have any weak groups?  If yes, then find the best way to pressure the weakest group.
3.  Find the biggest area.  

Here, black has a weak group at A.  this group needs help.]

(;B[qo]LB[eq:A]C[VingTsun [12k?\]: Maybe Artkid will review

DB: a big move, but I would rather settle the A group.  It is weak.  See variation for white.]

(;W[nq]LB[hq:A][iq:B]C[DB: White approaches thickness.  This is the wrong direction.

Ok, for black:

1.  Do I have any weak groups?  
Yes, E3 is weak, black should help it at A. I think B would be asking for trouble, since white will have the next move and is relatively settled.  
Notice how different the game is if black plays to help Q3 before settling E3 first!]

(;B[iq]LB[nq:A]TR[gq]C[DB:  Good thinking.  Settle the weak black group.  Also, this makes white weaker, and white will need to fix this group.  Still, I would be a little worried about the weakness here.  I would rather hold back one at H3.  

For white: 

1.  Do I have any weak groups?  

I think the A group needs help now, he should come out at O5 or L5.  I like L5 most, since it pressures the black group and aims at G3.]

(;W[nc]C[DB: this is a big move for white, but I'm not sure I would be willing to leave the bottom area yet.

For black:


1.  Do I have any weak groups?   

Q16 has been approached, so black should respond to this.]
(;B[pf]C[DB: Ok, but playing on the 4th line at Q14 makes the statement that black wants to expand the right side.
But the right side is awkward to build because the lower shimari is in the wrong direction.
See variations here.]
(;W[jd]C[DB: ok, time for the 3 questions again:


1.  Do I have any weak groups?  
Well...
The upper shimari isn't finished yet, but it isn't weak either.
The lower shimari is settled and strong.
The lower left group is fairly settled, although the distance between E3 and J3 I find rather nagging...
I would like to fix this.

How to fix?  Well, let's ask the questions again:

Do I have any (other) weak groups?  No.  
Does white have a weak group?  Yes.  Aha!  Is there a move that I can use to help my weak group while harassing white's weak group?  I think you can see it...]

(;B[ce]TR[eq]C[Too soon.  Black's marked group needs help.]
;W[ci]LB[cc:D][ed:A][fd:B][ee:E][fe:C]C[Still...the 3 questions:


1.  Do I have any weak groups?   

Yes.  C15 is locally outnumbered 2 to 1.  
Arguably the weakest group on the board.
Most common joseki choices from here.  E is not joseki.]
(;B[ee]C[This is not joseki.  If this, then jump out one farther, to F15.  see variation.]
;W[gc]LB[bc:A][cc:B][ge:D][dh:C]TR[ce][ee]C[DB:  Every move should be guided by 3 questions:
1.  Do I have any weak groups?  
2.  Does white have any weak groups?
3.  Find the biggest areas

1.  Do I have any weak groups?  Yes.  The marked group has only 2 directions to grow/run: into the corner and into the centre.  A healthy group has 3 directions.  So this group needs help.  This is the most important thing to do on this board.  

Possible ways that I can think to play are listed A through D.
I think I like B most - settles black quickly.  This variation is shown already at move 17.]
;B[qk]LB[ce:A]TR[qh]C[This move has no good relation with either side.  White can easily come in around R12 and the relationship with the black shimari is flat.  Better to have helped the A group. It is still weak.]
;W[qh]LB[ce:A]C[white invades.  It is a little dangerous - only 2 ways to run (upper side and centre), but I think this is playable.

Ok, our three questions:

1.  Do I have any weak groups?   If yes, then help the weakest group. 

The A group is still weak.  Help it!]
(;B[rg]LB[ce:A]TR[pb]C[Black: Questionable IMHO. Perhaps timid... not committed to fight yet. Contact kosumi @ 13 better?

Black is not ready to fight yet.  A is still weak.  The corner is open.  Locally, sealing the corner is bigger then touching this weak stone.

Contacting will help a weak stone, not attack it.
Locally, defend around the marked area.]
(;W[qc]LB[ce:A]C[white invades the corner.  Excellent timing.  Although the biggest moves are attacking the A group.]

(;B[qd]LB[ce:A]C[too timid.  Still the biggest move is to help the A group.]

(;B[jo]LB[dd:A]C[Midnight [-\]: I was kidding

DB:The corner is already trampled on.  There is nothing in the corner except 2-4 points.]
;W[rf]
(;B[rh]CR[qi][ri]C[Black: Goofy move. Circled points would have been better, certainly.]
;W[ri];B[qi];W[sh];B[pg];W[sg]TR[dd]C[DB: ok, time for the questions:

1.  Do I have any weak groups?  

Black's groups all have a base and all have room to grow into the centre (the only remaining open area, since corners and sides are pretty much settled).

Ignoring the the marked point would be unsettling for me though.  
I mean, black isn't about to die here, but I just wouldn't want to have to deal with white playing D16.  
And black D16 And is sente, so probably fix here first.]
(;B[qj]C[small move.  If white wants to atari and capture this stone, let him.  There are better things to do.  The 3 questions will help you find those better things.]

(;W[mh]C[1.  Do I have any weak groups?   

White D16 would hurt the upper black group, so...]
(;B[nj]LB[dd:A]C[A remains bigger.];W[gh]
(;B[ec]C[bad.D16 bigger.];W[eb]
(;B[fc]C[Black: Should have been D16!

DB: Black lets white "hane at the head of two" here.  The hane is already in place at G17.  It's like black let white hit him on the head!]
;W[fb];B[gd]C[Black: another opportunity for D16, or bamboo @ F15?

DB: fix at D16 then tenuki.];W[fd];B[ed];W[hd]LB[lo:A]TR[li]
C[DB:  Ok time for the questions again.

1.  Do I have any weak groups?  

Black looks pretty much settled.

2.  Does white have any weak groups?  If yes, then find the best way to pressure the weakest group.

The A group is weak, so this should be pressured.  I might be going on a limb here, but I like starting the attack by a shoulder hit at M11.]
;B[fe]C[this move is 0.5 point.];W[gf]LB[li:A]C[VingTsun [12k?\]: We'll come back to 69
VingTsun [12k?\]: yes
VingTsun [12k?\]: ?

DB: Hard for me to comment on the variations here.  But I find them all small.  White has a weak group on the bottom and it should be pressured by black.
I think I like starting with A.]
(;B[kj]C[Black: IMHO THIS is the game deciding move... It SHOULD have been L11 instead.

DB: So many mistakes in the fuseki prior to this move.  Hard to say if this board has a game deciding move.]
;W[ji];B[jj];W[ki]
(;B[fj]
(;W[ej]C[GoRival [9k\]: ok]
(;B[hj]C[VingTsun [12k?\]: Back to 69!];W[gk]C[DB:all too loose on both sides.]

(;B[fi];W[fh];B[ei];W[ek]LB[lo:A]TR[mr]C[DB:
1.  Do I have any weak groups?   
Black looks settled.

2.  Does white have any weak groups?  

A is weak.  Attack A.
Maybe it's ready to poke out the base.];B[fk];W[el]LB[lo:A]
C[DB:  F9 is nice - for 2 points.

Instead:  

1.  Do I have any weak groups?   If yes, then help the weakest group.  If no, then next question
2.  Does white have any weak groups?  If yes, then find the best way to pressure the weakest group.

A remains weak.

Ok.  I'll stop reiterating these ideas.  I hope I have convinced you that they are very useful.
Even if white A lives, pressuring it will bring profit in sente for black.  Who could ask for more?  Profit in sente?]
