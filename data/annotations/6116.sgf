C[Hello reviewer!

I played black in this game and lost. I didn't make any serious tactical mistakes (until the end) but fell behind anyway, so I'd especially appreciate comments on direction of play. I've tried to mention what I was thinking throughout the game.

Thanks very much for your time

Lloyd

Empiror: try to lower your threshold for 'serious tactical mistake' so that you can improve faster.]

(;B[pf]C[This move I wasn't sure about. I couldn't think of a better way to make use of black's thickness lower down.

Emp: b doesn't have K16 to constitute a serious moyo, Q14 is stengthening w, not a good move in this situation.]
;W[pg];B[qe]C[Emp:bad strategy. again, upper side is more valuable, the upper right corner is small. Giving w O14  reduces the efficiency of C10, D16 etc ...]
;W[of];B[pe];W[og];B[nd];W[qj]C[I settled for this, just being able to take sente. Was there a better way to play?

Emp: don't make ur oppnent thickness for little points at the openning stage. 

think about the bigger picture: with P13 three stones, b's thickness at lower right is of no much use, b's potential moyo at upper side will be much easier to invade.

for now, b should keep going with S13 or S14. it's about keeping w under threat.]
;B[cm];W[rp]C[Emp:w's move  too early, too small];B[mm];W[lc]
C[Emp: consequence of b not pushing with S13 or S14. because w's P13 group looks like a thickness without b S13.]
;B[jd]C[This seems wrong, because it ends up in an awkward place. Is something like J17 better?

Emp: ya, very strange move, attack? defend?];W[nb];B[pb];W[le]
C[Now I can't make much use of K16 without pushing through

Emp: this shape, b should immediately go with L17, w M18, b can consider having gained a little bit]

(;B[eo]C[Emp: strange approach. K3 is a good landing spot if b really wants to parachute in. K3 has G3 or O2 as following move.  or, let w defend the lower side, w can't defend perfectly with one move, can w?

not a right timing for this.

L17, then F17 seems right for b, b will be aiming at N14 to divide w.]
