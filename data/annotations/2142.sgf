C[Hello,

I would also like to know what you would rate me as. KGS says 16k I think weaker. 9k says I'm strong 17k

Hi I cannot rate your only by watching a game of you (ratings are relative). If KGS says you are 16k (without ?) then you most probably are around 16kyu.

My comments start with "LoP".

I hope i can help you with this review.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd]
;B[pk];W[nc];B[pf];W[ic]C[LoP: This Fuseki was played by Fujisawa Hideyuki and Kato Masao in the Kisei Final 1978
so it should be ok ;)];B[cf]C[LoP: This move is unorthodox. Not only do you force white to make a nice shimari (corner enclosure) with E16 but your stone might also be attacked later.

The bottom is more important now.  Kato Masao just extended the black moyo with J4.
I think the most simple move in this situation is K4.]
(;W[ch]C[LoP: Maybe attacking this stone is too agressive. I think taking the corner with E16 is enough for white (see var.)]
;B[dd];W[dc];B[ed];W[ec]
(;B[gd]C[LoP: Black should go for good shape in this situation (see var.)]
;W[ce]
(;B[de]C[LoP: empty triangle = bad shape]
(;W[cg]C[LoP: connecting is good but white can play more agressive (see var.)]
;B[dg];W[bf]
(;B[cn]C[LoP: Too early black has a weak group and has to settle it before playing somewhere else.  (see var.)
If you play here now the C6 stone might come under attack and this would be very dangerous for the E16 group.]
;W[co];B[dn]
(;W[qo]C[LoP: finishing the joseki with F4 first is important (urgent move before big move)
after finishing the joseki on the left white can still play at R5 (or better Q5)

This move is a little deep. usually w Q5 black O4 is played with the high chinese fuseki (see var.)]

(;B[np]C[LoP: Ok but R5 better (see var.)];W[ql]C[ShrtAzNBoi [16k\]: hmmm your the first person to play that there @_@. i had Q5 covered pretty much

LoP: yes it is really a little deep.];B[qk]C[LoP: this exchange is good for black because the top left side becomes pretty secure territory.]
;W[pp]
(;B[op]C[LoP: this is not so good because you let white make good eye shape with R3.  (see var.)]
;W[qq]
(;B[or]
(;W[oo]C[LoP: Play kikashi (forcing move) at Q2 first. (see var.)]

(;B[jp]C[LoP: Ok but an extension is not really needed here because your P4 group is strong. You can punish white now for not finishing the joseki. (see var.)]
;W[hq];B[cj]C[LoP: good];W[jr]C[ShrtAzNBoi [16k\]: group tto left weak

LoP: white succeded undermining your territory now your K4 stone is pretty worthless]

(;W[oi];B[ri]C[LoP: connecting is very important, good.];W[og]
;B[ne]C[LoP: moving out to the center, good.];W[od]C[LoP: interesting]

(;B[oe];W[pc];B[qd];W[qc]C[LoP: this is an exquisit result for white.]
;B[mc]C[LoP: good!];W[mb];B[lc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
(;B[qe]C[LoP: not needed (see var.)

Black is overconcentrated here. I think the game favors white a lot already

Let' count (only a rough estimation in 5s):

White:      Top Left: ~20
    Top Right: ~15
    Bottom Left: about 30 possible but very insecure i think white can expect around 15.
    Left Side: ~10
    ----
    Sum: 60

Black     Left Side: ~10
   Bottom: ~10
   Right Side: ~15
   The D15 group will bring nearly no territory at all (you can expect at most 5 points)
   ---
   Sum: 40


White has one weak group at P11. with the black power at N17 and O15 it can be attacked easily (e.g. with O10). But Black also has a weak group at E16 so white has a nice advantage.

The weak white group should be the focus of the next moves.]
;W[gc]C[ShrtAzNBoi [16k\]: >_< was looking at that for awhile

LoP: very good];B[fc];W[fb];B[fd];W[hc]
(;B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[fq];B[hp]C[LoP: E4, F4 and this move hold white down, white egst territory while black gets power. The problem is black has no good use for this power so playing E4 and follow ups was not so good.
Because black is behind he should invade at F3 instead of E4 this will spell troubles on white.]
;W[no];B[om];W[pm];B[pl];W[qm];B[nl];W[di]C[LoP: this prepares the attack on F16.]

(;B[dj];W[if]C[ShrtAzNBoi [16k\]: >_< I've already lost
lks [11k\]: hehe, nah];B[gf]LB[gh:A]C[LoP: too slow you should try to get out as fast as possible. (e.g. with G13 [a\] instead)]
;W[hh]C[ShrtAzNBoi [16k\]: usually in my games only sid and center are territory >_<

(;B[ng]C[LoP: 4 stones are worth more than 1 stone (see var.)]
