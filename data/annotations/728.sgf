;B[pd]C[GENERAL COMMENT :  Although the final result is very close, (white only win by half a point), both players missed successively several opportunities to take the lead of the game.
Black player showed a great fighting spirit, and seems to be stronger than his average level (13k) in close-range / tactical situations. Nevertheless, black launched 2 fights in areas where white had a strong position, and get himself into serious and unnecessary trouble. I'm convinced black can get 1 or 2 stones stronger if he forced himself to take into account the relative balance of forces before deciding to attack or invade.
White player shows a good feeling of fuseki, and developped a nice and calm position. Black's unreasonable invasions gave white the opportunity to take the lead in the earliest stage of the game. But some imprecisions let black get back in the race.
One can feel frustate that white didn't succeed to "sanction" black invasions, and that black finally managed to settle his groups without giving a consequent compensation. That's a widespread complaint among go players.....("he came in MY area and stole MY territory"). But if you think about a while, you'll agree that black took a lot of risks by playing this way, and could have lost the game on several occasions. On the contrary, white didn't risk anything as his position were safe. That's why i'm convinced white player will surely get stronger by working on close-range/ tactical situations to eliminate the few imprecisions/misreading.

(;B[cf]TR[pd]C[should black have approached at f17 instead?

C14 is a possible move. But F17 is more natural. F17 approach help to develop the marked black stone .
C14 is a move wich "separates" the 2 white stones, and leads often to complicate opening.
See the 2 variations for further explanations.];W[di]
(;B[bi]LB[ef:a][cc:b]C[It is not a good idea to play on the 2nd line, because b11 has few influence on d11 stone. This ables white to ignore b11 locally and play a caping move at  a for exemple.
There are only 2 options for black : jump to a, or play b.
See the 2 variations.];W[ef];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[dh]C[this sequence is good for white, as black group is surrounded.]
;B[ch]C[C12 gives black a bad shape. better at C13 or B13.]
;W[jd]TR[dd][ef][dh][di][cc]C[Very good move. White k16 is a nice extension of the white marked stones.]
;B[de];W[ee];B[cd];W[ec];B[dg];W[eg]TR[cd][de][dg][dd][ec][ee]
C[The last 3 black  moves only help white to reinforce his shape. The weaknesses of white group at E15 and E13 disappears with this sequence.
Furthermore, it give white a double atari at d14.


If Black is afraid of the status of his group, it is far better to play at c9 for example.]
;B[dj];W[nc]LB[fh:a]C[Hard to say if white should better play at A ...]
;B[lc]C[The black invasion at M17 is not a good idea. White is very strong in this side of the board, because of his iron wall at E15.
So white will probably take advantage in any fight on the upper side.
Black should better answer at Q14.]
(;W[ne]C[should I have pressed at N16 instead, given my thickness in upper left?

Yes i think so. N16 is a severe move you might have used.
I tried to find continuations with N16, and every variations give white a good result.
But O15 is not a bad move. It is just a simple way to answer.]
;B[le];W[pf];B[ib]
(;W[kc]C[L17 doesn't cut. This move  helps black. This is this little imprecision that gives black a "not so bad" result.
White should have played k18.See variations];B[kb];W[lb];B[mb]
LB[kd:a]C[My thoughts were K18 or M16, now.... I went with K18, maybe M16 would have been better.

Yes maybe M16 was better. But Black had the choice to play L16 first then N18.]
;W[jb];B[la];W[ja];B[kd];W[jc];B[je];W[ie]C[This is a good result for black , if you consider that M17 was overplay.]

(;W[hf]C[Maybe it's better to play F12 instead of H14. Black has no way to capture j14 cutting stones.
another way is to counter attack with K14 (See variation).]
;B[eh]C[Good timing for black.];W[ei];B[fh];W[fe]LB[gf:a][fj:b]
[jf:c]C[White F15 better at A, because it connects the 2 group of stones.
But this move is not urgent :  Black can capture the 3 white stones with a net at B. So white should better play B or counter attack with C.]
;B[ob]LB[fj:a]C[It is a big move, because it helps to settle black M19 group and help the lonely q16 stone., but i think it's better to capture the 3 white stones at A first.]
;W[qe]LB[fj:a]C[Same thing, better play at A.];B[nb];W[qd];B[qc]
;W[pe]LB[rc:a][fj:b]C[Locally better at A.  Globally, B still urge :-)]
;B[od];W[qj]LB[fj:a][rc:b]C[R10 is a big point but it's not an urgent move. Better at A.
White will still have B to settle his group.];B[cn];W[fp];B[fi]
C[There's a proverb worth remembering :  When you can capture with a ladder, check if a  net doesn't work". The net (or "geta" in japanese) is better than the ladder because it doesn't able ladder's break.]

(;W[qm]LB[nq:a][qn:b][no:c]TR[jp]C[I didn't want to extend all the way to R6 and leave an invasion point.

It's better to play at A, because the marked stone is high (4th line). An exchange white A,black B, white C give you a valuable lower side.
You have nothing to fear about an invasion, see variation for white B.]
;B[mq]TR[qj][qm]C[Should I have invaded at P3 immediately here?

No, surely not. You can play R3 or R4.

this is not a good exchange for white. Black can reduce the lower side by sliding at K2.
The extension betewwen the 2 marked stone is too narrow.];W[rp]
;B[qq];W[rq];B[bp]C[I seem to have lost the initiative with S3, which was a bit too small a move, I think.

;B[oo];W[ro];B[nn];W[pq]C[Got something from S3, after all.

Well only 2 or 3 points in the corner. Black get a terrific position in the center.]
