C[Hi,
This is a game between my friend and me.  We're both between 5k-10k.  The game was close, but we both feel we could've played better.  Could the review be for both black and white?  Thanks in advance for the help!


erker: Hi, this is a nice game and I learned a lot doing the review. I hope both of you will get something out of it.

Some general remarks:

Strategically, both of you entered "endgame mode" to early, i.e. playing to soft instead of attacking weak groups (the white group in the upper left corner and the black group at the left side).

Tactically, pay more attention to liberties. It may not look so bad to loose a liberty, but it's the same as with empty triangles: eventually, they will bite you.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[dc];W[pq];B[cf]LB[pp:A]C[Small knight enclosure here?  I guess it doesn't make a difference this early, I just personally feel the small enclosure is better.


erker: Playing the small knight move enclosure in this situation is way more popular (in the data base of www.gobase.org it's 2 to 37, and 11 to 200 if the white stone is at A),but that does not mean the large knight move is bad.

But if you don't like it, just play the small knight move and reserve the big one for games when you are in more experimental mood.]
;W[do]
(;B[dm]C[erker: Good. The black pincer is backed up by the black upper left corner. This may result in a big black framework.

The joseki in the variation is for reference. It would be bad to allow White to settle a group on the left side so easily.]
;W[fo]TR[dm]C[I don't deal with pincer often as white.  I'm not exactly sure what to aim for, the result I got in this game seems ok for white, but any suggestions here would be helpful.


erker: In the joseki in the variation of move 7 both Black and White get some territory and easy development. 

In the joseki played in the game, the black marked stone deprives White of the easy development. But there must be some sort of compensation (otherwise Black would never play the other joseki).
Your compensation is that you can build some strength and then attack the marked black stone.

That's essential: your aim should be to attack. Otherwise, Black gets away with this to easily.]
;B[fq];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[er]LB[br:A]C[erker: Moves 6 to 12 are joseki, but the last one should be at A. This protects the black group, you get your share of the corner and--most important--it keeps White busy.]
;W[cm]LB[dj:C][ck:A][dk:B]TR[dm]C[erker: Attaching makes both strong, it's a kind of an emergency measure. But your group is stronger than the marked black stone, so your aim should be to attack the marked black stone. 
Attaching is to soft. You should  play at A, B or C to counter-pincer the pincer.]
;B[dl];W[dn]LB[cl:B][cn:A]C[Looking back, I feel like I missed my chance to attack those two floating black stones.


erker: You  missed your chance to attack the _single_ stone. After the attachment, it's not so easy.

Your move should be at A. Otherwise, Black can play B in sente and that would work great with the upper left corner.]
;B[qn];W[qp];B[qk];W[qi]LB[jc:A][kc:B]TR[qk][qn]C[erker: I don't like this move, A is better.

The marked black group is stable (at least for the moment), so your move does not threaten it. It only blocks the development of the marked group, but this group is low (3rd line). Therefore it's neither important nor that big for Black to extend.

On the other hand, Black has a corner enclosure, so it is very desirable for Black to play at A (or B). As it is good for Black, it can't be bad for White.]
;B[jc];W[lc]LB[cl:A]TR[cm]SQ[dl][dm]C[These last few moves by white were way too passive.  Would a move like D10 work here?


erker: I think your last move is OK. 

As black A is sente (threatening to capture the marked white stone), it is difficult to attack the marked black stones. Your attacking move might end being attacked on it's own.]
;B[on];W[oj];B[gd]LB[je:B][ef:A][cl:C]TR[cf]C[erker: This move is to submissive, it does not take into account the marked stone. You should play at A or B. Both moves make it very difficult for White to invade and not helping Black.

To play at A is especially attractive, because of the sente play at C.]
;W[cd]LB[ef:C][cl:A][bm:B]C[Too early to enter black's framework?


erker: No. Imagine Black A, White B, Black C.];B[dd];W[ce];B[de]
LB[je:A]TR[gd]C[erker: The marked black stone is to close to the black wall. Instead, a stone at A would be ideal.]
;W[cb]LB[db:C][cc:A][bf:B]C[erker: This almost kills your group! Should be at A, aiming at B and C]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[cl]C[Maybe black should finish the sequence in the top left.

erker: Yes.];W[bm];B[qc];W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb]
;W[mb]LB[mc:A][md:C][od:B]C[erker: Better at A.
The possibility of the cut at B or the peep at C is very annoying. It gives Black a foothold to effectively reduce the white moyo.]

;B[ro];W[rp];B[rj];W[ri];B[rm];W[qj]C[erker: This is not necessary for White and not sente: Black is out in the open. It's better to play at the lower side, as it gives White some territory and threaten to enclose the black group on the right.]
;B[op];W[oq];B[mp];W[nq]LB[mr:A]C[Probably should be N3 here.


erker: I prefer A.];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[fm];B[gj]LB[fk:A]C[Black F9 instead?

erker: Yes, A. Your move is a bit to ambitious.];W[fk];B[gk]
C[erker: ??? What is this move supposed to accomplish?];W[gl]
;B[ln]LB[kf:A]C[erker: To small. Your bottom left and right groups are safe and this move only extends your territory a little bit.

In the moment, the interesting parts of the board are the upper left corner and the border of Black's and White's moyo at the upper side. (For example, Black A.)]
;W[ke];B[bl]LB[ke:A][kf:B][lh:C]C[Should black answer white L15 here?  That would solidify a lot of territory for white, but as the game went, that territory went to white anyway and white gets a big reduction using J16.


erker: You should have played at A or B before White gets the chance to do so. But even now you can reduce the white moyo. (Around Black C?)]
;W[al];B[ak];W[am]
(;B[bd]LB[bd:1][be:2][bf:3]TR[cd][ce]C[erker: This is a good opportunity to introduce the 1-2-3 meta-tesuji:

If you have found a sequence 1-2-3 that works, try just 3. That may be work even better.

In this case: Black 1--White 2--Black 3 gets you Black 3 in sente, but it forces the white group to live. Instead, playing just Black 3 captures the two marked stones or kills the corner.

Even if you can not kill the corner, Black 3 just avoids to help White and may not cost you a liberty.]
;W[be];B[bf];W[ad];B[db];W[bb];B[bk]LB[bj:A]C[erker: For this "endgame type" of a connection the rule is: If your group is stable, connect firmly, because that leaves no ko threats behind. Otherwise use an open connection for the better eye shape.

As your group is heavy with no eyes, the right move is at A.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[hd];B[hc];W[hf];B[fj]C[erker: Wrong direction: you are pushing White into your potential territory.]
;W[ek];B[gg]C[Black F14 here?  G13 seems like big overplay.


erker: They are both wrong as you are trying to surround territory that is still open from below. See next move.]
;W[gf]LB[cj:B][dj:A]TR[ak][bk][bl][cl][dl][dm]C[erker: Your move is to passive. The marked black group is very heavy. If you play at A or maybe at B, Black will have a hard time to rescue this group, to keep the territory and to not endanger his center group.]

;B[ll];W[lj];B[im];W[ho];B[io];W[hn];B[in];W[hm];B[el]C[erker: Bad.

It's worth only 1 point but you lose one liberty. That's a bad deal. (See my comments on move 130 and 123.)]
;W[fl];B[bg]LB[cg:A][ch:B][cj:C]TR[ak][bk][bl][cl][dl][el][dm]
C[I didn't notice the tesuji as white, but I guess black did.


erker: Bad shape.

If Black worries about the cut at A, Black should connect at A (no ko threats) or at B (better shape).

But the problem is not the cut at A, it's the heavy marked group. So the correct move is to connect at C (this also protects against the cut at A).]

(;W[ck]LB[cj:A]C[erker: To soft. You can play at A, that's sheer fun and profit in sente.]

;B[mr];W[as]LB[bq:A][dr:B]C[erker: Bad.

It's a zero point gote move, i. e. you just passed for no good reason (there are still points on the board).

Even with a white stone at A it would be zero point sente, i.e. you would just eliminated a ko threat for no good reason.

And above all: you decreased your liberties. What is very dangerous. (Assume a black stone at B. After White at a1, Black can cut at A!)
