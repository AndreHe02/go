C[chevelu : I'm a 5k KGS (became 5 after this game) who sucks at fuseki, I think my strong point is chuban

Although I won this game, I feel that me and W has missed a lot of things there. Don't know if we can say that this game is interesting but it was a lot of fun playing it. :)

Thanks in advance to the reviewer.

Long: Hi chevelu. My name is Long (refered to as L below). I also play on KGS sometime (Comsaint 2d). It is a pleasure to review your game, and, after all, see you on KGS!

Brief summary: White's play was clearly more effective at start (with a big mistake too). In the combat on the right and lower side both player made a lot of errors, but it end up with white having a very clear lead. However, in the end white played a series of terrible moves and lost the game finally.

(;W[pn]C[L: Nowadays the sequence of this variation is well-discussed, but new things are still poping up. Make sure you are not out-of-date! I will only name some, and it is up to you to explore more.]
;B[nq];W[qj];B[qh]
(;W[oj]C[L: Usually white will not respond here immediately especially since Q6 is solidly connected together.]
;B[fq]C[L: Seems a little low and concentrated at lower side...
I'd choose C10 or F17.]
(;W[dq]C[I don't like W D3 but I don't know what to do agains that.

Pincer at c5 or c6?
Jumping to f5?
K4?

L: A good question! Before giving the answer for free, I'd like you to think about for white first:
    1. Who is stronger here?
    2. Black clearly wants something in the lower side. How would you reduce his point? The easiest way  is to make his stones ineffective and concentrate together. So how?

For answer, see variations...

Actually, D3 is a pretty good move];B[iq]C[or this... ok?

L: I'd play J4, just to "raise the height" a little. Now all the stones is on third-line, black is really really slow!]
;W[cj];B[fo]C[L: I'd play F17.];W[jc]C[L: I'd repond at D6. This exchange will be clearly favourable for white, since white gets points and is no longer vulnerable to attack, while black gets almost nothing and the lower side is still flat.]

(;B[cn]C[L: Now Black has found a fight here. But D6 may be better.]

(;W[co]C[L: Model mistake No.1];B[dn]C[L: Now white's corner is small and the potential of a mojo is destroyed. Upper-left corner is also weakened.]
;W[cc]C[L: Probe at C15 can help C10, since black is getting strong that side. But of course, the corner will be weaker. I'd prefer C15.]

(;W[jq]C[L: Since Black R9 is low, choosing this joseki is my first sense (you can also make a Q6-R6 exchange first before extending at about K3). Now R9 looks really slow and low.

My comment on this result is: Black has secured two corners, but its position is generally low over the board, and lack of big development opportunity (note that the upper-right side is quite easy to be reduced or invaded since R9 is far from corner). White's speed is faster.

I personally prefer white. Black's next move will probably be C10, preventing white from connecting upper and lower side together.]
