C[Hello and thank you for the review.
I played as Black in this game and lost by 30.5 points. This was a KGS ranked game.

I consider a few points that may have been inferior to me but I'm not sure where might have been a better point.

Comments end on move 125

Hello,

My name's Joss (tealeaf). I'll put comments throughout the game, and try to answer your questions.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp]C[Without being too early to jump in, I would consider playing at the top left corner here. 

The reason is that white is now likely to play there instead. If he follows up by playing an enclosure at E3 then he has his stones working nicely together.

If you play at D16 then white is likely to play around Q4, which is also fine but seems slightly less coordinated with his C4 stone.]
;W[dc];B[eq]C[Approaching and preventing him making his most useful enclosure.

I'd be tempted to play at E4 to prevent him from playing over the top of you, but this seems fine.]
;W[dn];B[ip]C[I didn't know the joseki for this and played what seemed locally best, since he doesn't attack me at all

--

All seems fine to me. Don't get bogged down in joseki.

I might consider playing at C2 to cut under him and snatch the corner, but I'm happy with J4. The only problem is if he jumped in at G3 to make you fight for it.]
;W[ce]LB[cj:B][jc:A][pj:C]C[This is a point I wasn't sure I chose the right point. I considered three points in this(marked).
I played A in the game because I didn't want white to play there. I can't see however if that was the biggest point the board.

---

I would play A. It stops an ideal approach towards your top-right corner that would support the enclosure in the top left.

C would be my next choice, as it's nice and solid.

B is a possibility, but I much prefer A.];B[jc];W[qf];B[nd]
;W[ph];B[qj]C[A point I consider that wasn't great for white but might be wrong. White doesn't make a proper base, so I take advantage of the fact.

--

I'd be more tempted to either:

a) protect the corner with R15 or R16 first. That makes a similar threat, but secures the corner as well.

b) play a little bit further back so that it's harder to attack the R10 stone.

however...];W[np]C[...];B[lq]C[A pincer seemed optimal, strengthening both my sides.

--

... having made the threat with R10 you could potentially have followed it up.

The pincer seems a bit over-concentrated to me. If you respond with Q6 or R6 then it makes an enclosure for you whilst working with your stone at R10.

My response here would most likely have been Q6.];W[pn]C[Now white has a double approach, and you have to both defend the corner and also the R10 stone.]
;B[qn]C[This seems reasonable.]
(;W[pq];B[qq];W[pr];B[po]C[I would prefer to defend the corner with R2. That would leave pressure on the Q3 stones. This move gives white a bit too much breathing room for my liking.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[qr];B[oq]C[I noticed later this was a mistake by my part. The variation was correct for white. Maybe I should have tenukied at this point?

--

I wouldn't be tempted to play elsewhere, so I agree with following up in the corner. I think that you should have been looking to end things quickly, though, and jump to more profitable plays.

So, while it's good that you're thinking to play elsewhere, I'd leave it a few moves.]
(;W[op];B[nq]C[I know that you saw that you could move elsewhere later, but do remember that you can often jump out of sequences that you realise are unprofitable. Re-evaluate every move!]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[mp];B[nr];W[oo];B[rp];W[lp];B[kq];W[dj]C[White's framework on the left seems good so I should attack it. I choose a reduction as I don't feel safe with third line there. Black seems like he is already behind.

Considering black got the bottom-right corner, white already has more points than black. So I feel like I failed on the opening.

---

Hmm. I don't agree. White has the bottom right corner, and most of the bottom. Black has a good chance of taking the top right corner and the top. The bottom left corner is still open for who wants it.

White has a weak group on the right (Q12, R14) that black can profitably attack. The left side has a lot of potential, but black can still have a lot of fun there.]
(;B[dg]C[I would probably dig in a little deeper.];W[cg];B[dh]
;W[ch];B[df];W[de];B[gg]LB[ee:A]C[I build shape but is that the best here? Maybe A?

I think that, for a reduction, this seems to work well. It leaves white with weaknesses in his wall (C14 and C11) that you can exploit, so I think you should be happy.]
;W[hc]
(;B[je]C[This is reasonable in combination with your right-hand corner, but I would be more tempted to directly exploit your reduction. Perhaps F11?]
;W[he];B[fe]C[This stab at the white corner isn't really going to reduce it that much, and I'm sure that there are better things to be done.

Off the top of my head, I'd suggest S12 to put white's stones under pressure, R16 to solidify the corner, C2 to take the bottom corner, D8 to break up white's side or F11 to reduce white's influence to the centre.]
;W[fd];B[ge];W[gd];B[nj]C[Splitting off white's stones is reasonable, but I think that directly cutting under them at S12 would be more effective.

Either way, I think that Q8 would be a useful bit of pressure to overconcentrate white's group.]
;W[nh];B[li]C[The pressure on white is good, but again I would suggest S12 to hamper white's ability to make eyespace.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[pk]C[This defends against a cut that shouldn't really be a concern (Q10) -- white can't cut there. It also doesn't really remove white's base, so I think that the stone could be more usefully put elsewhere.

N9 would be a better side to play against those stones, from my point of view.]
;W[pl];B[ql]C[Again, this is rather small in the context of the overall game.]
;W[lj];B[mi];W[mj];B[kj];W[ml];B[kk];W[kl];B[ik];W[im]
(;B[el]C[This seems a little bit of a stab in the wilderness.

I would guess that it's threatening to dig into white's side, while still being linkable to your other groups?

For this position I would prefer to play one point lower (D8) and make a fight of it.

However, from the overall context of the game I'd prefer to put white's stones aroun Q12 under pressure and get profit from those. They're really a potential goldmine!]
;W[dl];B[ek];W[dk];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[mf];B[le]C[Again, that group should be desperately looking for eyes but you're defending against its expansion rather than attacking it.

One point, though, is that you shouldn't assume you can kill the white group. You should just aim to make it as hard as possible for him, and get as much out of it as possible. Let him live, but let him live small.]
;W[me];B[md];W[qd];B[qc];W[rd];B[pe]C[I would definitely have defended at S17, but he didn't take advantage of grabbing the eyespace in the corner, so it doesn't really matter.]
;W[qe];B[pf]C[It's a worry for him, but it's quite small. C2 would be bigger, as would S12.]
;W[pg];B[nf]C[Again, this is a little bit too locally focused. There are big points elsewhere!]
;W[ng];B[mg];W[lf];B[lg];W[kf]
(;B[jf]C[When you're trying to contain someone, a tip is not to play too close. If you continually play contact moves, your stones lose liberties as you play them. If you play a little further away then by the time his stones reach that point, you can have a strong wall.

(In this case it's to kill, but you're ultimately just trying to stop him working out to somewhere where he can live.)

See the variations.];W[ke];B[kd];W[kg];B[kh];W[jg];B[if];W[jh]
;B[ji];W[ih];B[hg];W[ig];B[hf];W[hk]C[You were nearly successful, but the threats that white managed to work in while you were fighting have helped him a lot.]
;B[gk];W[ii];B[hl];W[ni];B[ij];W[mh];B[ki];W[lh];B[hi];W[hh]
;B[gh];W[of];B[ne];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[og];W[oh];B[rg]C[Since the cut didn't work, I try killing his group. didn't quite work as I expected.

Comments end here. The game is lost for black.

--

Attacking the base of the white group was a good idea, but you should have tried it much, much earlier!

You were unlucky, as the white group should have died earlier. I would say that my one tip, then, that you can learn from this game is to back off slightly when you're trying to kill or contain a group.

Think about playing knight's moves rather than contact moves when defending.

This is important for defense as much as attack. When you're defending against a group that has pushed into your area, it's best to give up 5 points at the start rather than give up 25 points as they push into your area!

In the early game, you were a little bit too timid to invade or attack enemy positions. My advice is to be brave in these situations; they won't always work, but you'll learn how to manage them. If you never make these crazy invasions, you'll never learn about them.

The other point to remember is that even in local sequences you should keep one eye on the entire board. In a few places in this game you carried on playing non-urgent local moves when there were large points available elsewhere.

Overall, though, a nice game; well done! To summarise:

1) Don't play too close when hemming someone in.
2) Be brave!
3) Keep the whole board in your mind all the time.

I hope this helped. and I'm sorry that I didn't have time to insert many proper variation sequences. Feel free to email me any questions, and if you see me online then say hi!
