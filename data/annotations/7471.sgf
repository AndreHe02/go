C[Hi there!

I'm Pyry Kovanen from Finland, aka Hyrveli on KGS. I'm currently ranked 7 kyu on the forementioned server.

I'll focus my criticisms on the White side, but also point out the most obvious errors Black makes. I may sound harsh at times, but that is only to make my point as clear as possible.

Why did White lose?

He lost because he made some unnecessarily deep invasions into Black's territory early in the game, which led to him having to keep his groups alive against severe pressure from Black. Black could go on the offensive while White was forced to defend.

He also lost because of some small reading errors, which were small but added up during the course of the game. White also kept following Black around for most of the game, which is a common mistake. Always try to think what is the biggest move on the whole board insted of just the local situation.

Black made it close in the endgame by letting White live in impossible situations. Nonetheless, his lead was too big in the end.]

;B[kp];W[dj]CR[qf]C[White has a good grasp of opening principles. I can't see any noteworthy mistakes in the fuseki by either player. In my eyes Black is slightly ahead, but the komi compensates for the minor difference.

This is definitely a better move than the marked one, however.]

(;B[io]C[This move is very odd. See the variations for more suitable continuations.]
;W[qo]SQ[qf]C[I don't like this move at all. White is trying to invade way too deep into black territory. Even though White can achieve life, the influence Black inevitably gets in return is much more valuable.

I'd much prefer invading near the marked spot.];B[qp]CR[po]
C[Good move by Black.]
(;W[oo]C[You are correct, this is an inferior move for White. See the variation for the standard continuation.]

;B[ln];W[mo];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr];W[jp]C[This is a somewhat nice trick play to save the giant white group (see variation), but Black does well not to fall for it.]

White is going to have a mountain to climb after losing the giant group, however.]
