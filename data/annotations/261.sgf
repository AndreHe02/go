(;B[bq]L[dp]C[A little unusual for black. The more  common move (a) is shown in the variation.
The reason to avoid this is when black is afraid of a white atari at b3.  In this position however there seems to be no reason for worrying. The
disadvantage of the move played is that black is a bit less solid and can  still be attacked at a later stage.]
;W[er];B[oq];W[lq]
(;B[po]L[qm]C[I am  not terribly fond of that move. White gets a chance to cut and start  a fight in an area where he is strong, or alternatively (the way things  were played) force black to build a wall pointing in the wrong direction.  I would prefer the counter-pincer in variation (a).]
;W[qo]L[pp]C[White can cut and fight here if desired. A matter of style I guess.
I myself would also prefer the move played (R5).]
(;B[pn]
(;W[qn]L[qm]C[It is better (faster) to jump to (a) at this point if you wish
to continue playing on the right side (as I think you should).  The only reason to push twice is if you want to play elsewhere next.]
;B[pm];W[ql];B[id]
(;W[pl]L[lo]C[I feel this move may be bogus.  The idea was  to attack
P3 group, but building thickness towards Q16 seems like
a waste of time.  What's the best way to attack P3 group?
Should that be my first priority, or should I do something
about black's top instead?
           -kkkken

The move you played looks tempting, but I think you are right:  it is bogus. The marked stone has a low and very solid position,  making that area uninteresting for both for the time being. How  about a move at (a)? That reinforces your stone, builds territory
and attacks the black group.];B[nm]
(;W[qf]L[lo]C[This seems bad because  M3 is lonely and black has P8,
but I didn't know what to do.  O7 seems like a very nice
move.
         -kkkken

Maybe still m5? The move you played is very big in itself
(black p8 is no worry, you are happy to answer at q10), but
I agree that the bottom looks a bit thin.];B[pi]L[nd][pf]M[lq]C[I  felt this was an overplay given q8's strength.
I would have played q14.  would this have been better?
-kkkken

Maybe simply at o16, followed by an invasion in the bottom or the  right. Q14 also goes in the right direction, but white may be able  to get back to m3 (mark) first.]

(;W[ol];B[qd]
(;W[of]L[ln]C[Hmm, I am  not sure about this. The territory you threaten to enclose on  the right is not big and full of holes. Maybe it is better to keep the  option of an invasion into the top side and play m6 instead (a wider jump  than before, because p8 is present). Because of the strength of your wall,  black can't hope for too much on the right.]
;B[nd];W[ni]
(;B[nh]L[pg]C[The wrong sequence, gives white a good result. Black should peep
at (a) first!];W[oh];B[oi];W[ph];B[nj];W[mi];B[ok];W[nl]C[Nice sequence!]
;B[mj];W[li];B[lj];W[lg]L[mg]C[(a) is better shape];B[ll];W[mm]C[An  ideal splitting attack!]
;B[no];W[mn];B[mo];W[lo];B[mq];W[lp];B[mr];W[pr]L[lr]C[Better at (a). The side offers more potential territory than the corner,
and black can't be killed anyway.];B[pq];W[qq];B[or]C[white is  very happy here.
(should I be?)
   -kkkken

I think you should.];W[jj];B[jk]L[dj][ki]M[lg]C[When I played K10 I  thought it was very nice
but after seeing K9 I was just sad.  I'm running
black right through my own lower moyo.  How can I  attack M10 group while making territory somewhere?
  -kkkken

Your problem is that the bottom area is open-skirted, so  aiming to make territory there is hoping for a bit much.  I would concentrate on spoiling blacks position with moves  like (a), aiming to build thickness with which to attack  black effectively. You may be able to convert the bottom  into territory later, but that is endgame because m2 is gote.
Note also the bad potential of a black stone at (b), caused by  not-so-ideal position of the marked white stone.   
Anyway, a better way of attacking is shown in variation 3.]
(;W[ld]C[Good  idea. Reduce black while trying to cover the bad aji of L11
shown before.];B[me]M[nh]C[Huj, a tough move. hard to answer. Maybe your  previous move
wasn't such a good idea after all :(  Maybe the best bet is to
catch the marked stone as shown in the variation:]
(;W[le];B[mf];W[mg];B[lf];W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[ng]C[He got me here.  I can't O14!
   -kkkken

Ouch! A very clever sequence for black!];W[kh];B[nf];W[qi]C[This turned out  badly for me.
Was there a better option?  once I've suffered O14,
what's my best move?
   -kkkken

R11 certainly is the only promising move ...
see below];B[qj];W[pj]C[Doesn't hurt, but smells of aji-keshi. Better wait  with this move.]
;B[oj]
(;W[pk]C[Here you go wrong. This move is too complacant.  You should
extend to s11! You get definite life and connection, at the cost
of giving black a safe eye.];B[qh];W[ri];B[rh];W[rj];B[pg]C[All very  unfortunate.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[nc];B[mc];W[md];B[mb];W[lc]
(;B[pc]L[lb]C[Better at (a). sente!];W[lb];B[ob]C[I was happy with this result ---  black has a large corner
but I have tremendous thickness facing left.  Was it a good
trade for me?
    -kkkken

As it stands, it was: this way you stay in the game. Black should  really have tried to keep sente (with m18 instead of q17). Then, he  gets a chance to play (a) himself.]
;W[ed]C[good!];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[he];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[hg];W[bf]
;B[bd];W[hj]L[eg][cm]C[This would  be a very good move if the central black group was  still attackable. As it stands, however, it might be better to  simply reinforce at (a), for example (defends against nasty  cutting aji near D15) and aim for (b).]
;B[ef]C[Spot on! this hurts ...];W[de];B[di];W[dh];B[eh];W[ei];B[dg];W[ch]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[dj];W[bi];B[fh];W[fj];B[gi];W[gj];B[ii];W[ij]L[cm]C[now my wall faces the right way except  it's too
late, black has already slipped through with K9
and M8.  :-(  what should I be trying to accomplish
while harassing blacks' weak H13 group?
    -kkkken

If you get a chance, you should aim for (a)! That way your  wall has a purpose. And blacks h13-monster looks so weak
that you should keep sente there. No, I think that your  wall is very useful!]

;B[if];W[cl]L[cm]C[Yes, the right direction! But I  would go to (a), which is further  from your strength and presses black harder.]

;B[ck];W[aj]C[I felt like I was  outsmarted again here.
   -kkkken

No, this was only an oversight. Blacks earlier tricks were  much much harder to counter.]
;B[bl];W[cj];B[bm];W[dk];B[kr]C[
ouch.
  -kkkken

:) Yes, a bit unfortunate this. I am afraid that black is a good bit  ahead now.]
;W[lr];B[ls];W[jq];B[kq];W[jp];B[kp]C[I think J2 is bigger. This  push accomplishes nothing, it just  looses a liberty.]
;W[ko];B[qr];W[rr];B[ps]
(;W[jr]C[K2 was probably not worth  playing, right?
    -kkkken

Yes it was! It secures quite a few points at the bottom (If you don't play  there,
black can play J2 almost in sente! See the variation.];B[im]C[
fortunately black helped me out here a bit.
I felt J7 was an overplay.  If b had k7 instead
he probably would have won?
   -kkkken

Hmmm, blacks advantage was reduced a fair bit by his mistake
at the bottom. He may still be ahead, but not by all that much.
If he plays k7, you get sente moves at t12, b2 and then play  somewhere around j6. That gets you close.]
