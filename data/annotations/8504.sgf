C[Hi, This is David Fotland, your reviewer.  My comments will start with df:

I've entered some variations.  Please look for them.

White fell behind early with a big loss in the lower left corner. Black started a fight when he was ahead and lost a big group, but it was not enough.]
;B[qp]C[Fassal [3k\]: Hi gg
spip38 [4k\]: hi hf];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[pj]C[df: unusual, but playable.]
(;W[oq]C[df: when black already has a position up the side, consider approaching one space further away.  The stone on the right edge will help black in the fighting after a pincer.]
;B[lp];W[qq]LB[on:A]C[df: jumping out at A is far more popular after this pincer.  Attaching to settle quickly is a reasonable plan, but black can get a good result in this situation.]
(;B[pp]C[df: mistake.  The joseki is to hane.]
(;W[op]C[df: mistake.  white must connect.  This gives up way too much in the corner.]
;B[pq];W[po]LB[pr:A]C[df: this just leaves a cut behind.  A is better.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm];B[ql]
(;W[qm]C[df: this kind of move is almost always bad unless white can cut immediately.  If the cut is not possible, this move just fills one of white's liberties.]
;B[rm];W[pl];B[qk]C[df: Black has quite a bit of territory, and white's wall is not very strong.  White is already behind.]
;W[fq]C[df: good.]
(;B[eq]SQ[lp]C[df: mistake.  White is planning to use his wall to attack the black stone on the lower side, so don't make white stronger. A pincer is better.]
;W[fp];B[cn];W[jp]C[df: good];B[jq]LB[kq:B][iq:A]C[df: good fighting move.  White doesn't want to answer at A because it makes him over concentrated.  I would prefer to fight back at B rather than the move in the game.]
(;W[kp]C[df: this kind of move (bashing into another stone) is usually bad.  It invites black to connect underneith.]
;B[no]C[df: this peep shows just how weak the white wall is, and how much white lost in the lower right corner.]
(;W[oo]LB[lq:B][kp:A]C[df:Since black ignored A, consider playing B and taking the lower side territory, but it looks like black gets a strong attack on the weak white wall.]
;B[lq];W[kq];B[mm]LB[ln:A]C[df: this shape looks a little odd.  I would play at A, staying away from white's thickness, and moving toward the more open area of the board, and maintaining a connection.]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[mn]
(;B[ln];W[nm]TR[mp]C[df: I would consider the marked move to keep white to one eye.]
(;B[ml];W[nn]
(;B[iq]C[df: mistake, since it gets captured on a large scale.  Connecting under is better (works because you can threaten the big white group).]
;W[kr]C[df: white gains a lot with this move since he can connect under if he needs to later.]
(;B[in];W[jn]
(;B[jm]C[df: you can pull out the two stones and take the lower left corner, in exchange for leaving your center group weak.   I like black's approach since it gives him massive thickness.]
;W[kn];B[km];W[io];B[hn];W[ho];B[gn];W[go];B[fn]C[df: black is now ahead in both territory and thickness.  It will be almsot impossible for white to catch up.]
;W[eo]C[df: helps black.]
(;B[do];W[en];B[em]TR[eo][do]C[df: black's corner is much stronger after the marked exchange.]
(;W[oc]C[df: this is not good.  Black has a lot of thickness in the bottom, so he will want to extend on the left side to make territory. White should stop this now.]
(;B[jd]LB[df:B][cf:A]C[df: better to play at A or B.  Black is so thick that it will be easy to invade the upper side later if it is needed.]
;W[gc];B[cf]SQ[gc]C[df: since white already has the marked stone, he is a move ahead in this corner.]
;W[ef];B[bd];W[cc]
(;B[bc]C[df: way too small.  Take territory on the left instead.]
(;W[jf]C[df: it might be better to reduce the left side first in sente, build some thickness, then attack the black stone.  See the variation on the previous move.]
;B[md]C[df: by attacking this stone, white can negate much of black's center thickness.]
(;W[lc];B[ld];W[kc];B[kd];W[lf]
(;B[mf];W[mg];B[nf];W[ng];B[jc]LB[mc:A]C[df: playing on the other side at A should be better.  It isolates the corner, which might get in trouble after you surround it.]
;W[mc];B[og];W[of];B[oe];W[pf];B[pe]
(;W[qe];B[nd];W[nc];B[lg]C[df: good cut.  Black's thickness is working well.]
;W[kf];B[oh];W[lh];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[jh];B[dh];W[er];B[dr]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[fh];B[dj];W[rg];B[qh];W[sj];B[rj];W[si];B[ri]
;W[sh];B[rh]C[df: this just fills a dame.  there are far bigger points.]
;W[sk];B[sl];W[sg];B[rk];W[rd];B[gb];W[hc];B[hb];W[ie]
(;B[fc]C[df: dangerous.  Black is far ahead now, so he should be making safe and secure moves.  There is no need to pick a fight when you are way ahead.]
;W[ib];B[fe];W[hd];B[ee];W[de];B[df];W[jb];B[gf];W[eg];B[ec]
;W[bb];B[db];W[cb];B[ab];W[ha];B[fb];W[hg];B[ic]LB[dm:A]C[df: black can already win the fight here, so this move is pointless. Defend your weakness at A now for a big win.]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[fm];B[el];W[gl]LB[hl:A]C[df: A is the standard shape here, both for attacking the two white stones (makes them short of liberties), and for defending the cut (and eye).]
(;B[il];W[hl];B[ik];W[gj];B[mj]LB[nk:A]C[df: It is far better to conenct at A.  You are so far ahead there is no need to try to make more territory in the center.]
;W[nk]
(;B[mk]LB[nj:A]C[df: simpler to just connect at A.];W[nj]
(;B[ii]LB[ni:B][kj:A]C[df: far better to kill the white group (or escape) at B.  Even A is better since it make more eye shape, but it's not enough to live.]
