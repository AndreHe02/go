C[asato [16k?\]: Hi. Thanks for reviewing my game.
I played black. I thought I was playing well, but I did some mistakes and lost the game.

In the middle game I was playing for expand influences, trying to make a big territory. But it was so big that I couldn't protect it.
I wonder if I should be more modest and make territories that I can defend.

A>I'm andre,I'll do my best to review your game];B[qd];W[pp]
;B[dd];W[dp];B[od]SQ[dp]CR[cn][dn][dd]C[A>White is weak, he played to much influence, you should attack him on either spot but its best to attack D4 stone from C6 or D6 and strengthen your D16]
;W[fc]
(;B[cf]CR[hc][jc]C[A>instead of this normal joseki, you can push him by pressing on F17 or L17, he may get the corner, but you gain a solid territory.]
;W[ic]
(;B[kc]C[A> this is too close, how about M17 instead? and what will you do if white puts a stone at N17 ?]
;W[db];B[cc];W[mc]C[A> Black's mistake starting to take effect]

(;B[qj]C[A> you should have defended your L17 by strengthening at L15]
;W[ql];B[ke];W[kd]C[asato [16k?\]: Here starts a sequence that I wasn't expect. I'll comment later.]
;B[ld];W[jd];B[le]CR[lc]C[A> this point, you abandon territory for influence, if you play at L17, its vice versa]
;W[lc];B[oc];W[nb]SQ[oj]C[A> this play is too soon, I'd rather go for P8]

(;B[ob]C[asato [16k?\]: I didn1t expect this, but I was kind of happy with this exchange. White takes a big territory, but I thought the influence of L15 group in the center was worth enough.

Later, I felt white was better. What do you think? How could I avoid this? (If possible).

A> see variation];W[qh];B[oj];W[pj]C[asato [16k?\]: I could not believe he did the same thing again.

A> I saw this pattern on some of Go Seigen's games, I forgot which.]
;B[pi];W[pk]
(;B[oi]C[A> No you should not give your territory to him];W[qi]
;B[qg]C[A> don't touch! touching made both side stronger and you're not at that weak position]
;W[rj]C[A> white should play at other position and black should play at Q13]
;B[cn]C[A> Q13 is worth 26 moku and great influence and again, you should play on his trritory to gain position around line 4 or 3]
;W[kb]C[A> White plays too small];B[gd]C[A> too soon, you should play at other territory, always aim for bigger ones!]
;W[gc];B[hd];W[je];B[fq]C[asato [16k?\]: I think I could get more profit in this double kakari. What could I do?

A> I say buy joseki books or download TurboGo and learn from its joseki dictionary, this is a joseki problem. I won't explain it because the variation is so many.]
;W[eo];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr]C[A> ok you want line 3 instead of left side]
;W[cp];B[bq];W[bp];B[eq]C[A> D2 is weak, this stone is better at E2]
;W[cm];B[cl]C[A> you should leave the C6 stone for latter usedown side is more tempting to play]

Please comment the following sequence (W N4 - B K3).

A> white do this because he has strength on right side so what he need is more stone at around centre to clain his territory.]

[hg]C[A> white has 4 entry points marked in square];W[ok];B[mk]
;W[jp];B[iq];W[ho];B[jm]C[asato [16k?\]: At this point, I felt the whole center was mine (poor guy...). What a mistake!

A> white has 1 corner and 2 half sides and 1 full sides, black has 1 corner and a little centre only. Black will lose dearly.]
