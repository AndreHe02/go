C[The review is requested by me (bom= Tomas Boman, 3k in Sweden)

My opponent said afterwords that I had a good start but lost in the end,
I agree with him, could you point out where it started to go wrong?
I have inserted some questions that I'm particularly curious about,
but I would be happy for comments of any kind

/Tomas

Forfun (hereafter 'fun') - There were a lot of quite interesting points in this game.  More than I could comment on.  It was a complex game with opportunities for both sides - some taken and some missed. I am better with a mouse than a keyboard so there are a number of variations with no comments. They are indicative of how I imagine the game might have developed.  Have fun!]

 bom 4k*: Nice to meet you];W[nc];B[lc]C[fun - I think that M17 is a "normal" approach and expects R17 in reply.  However, if I look at pro games (I checked Rin Kai Ho's fuseki dictionary in Japanese), black more often seems to simply reply at Q14, take sente and play first along the bottom.  One open question is how black intended to play if white at R14 (see variation).]

(;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me];W[jp]C[fun - So white ends with sente and has now played first against black's Chinese fuseki on the upper side and the lower side. I think the result is that white is playing on a larger, speedier scale than black.

IMHO, black's next play is questionable. In the variations we'll look at a couple of alternatives.]

(;B[fc]C[fun - This is almost certainly a mistake in direction. Black's shape is open at M18 on the upper right. White naturally wants to develop the left side and now black invites white to do so.]
;W[df];B[db];W[po];B[np]C[fun - Shall we call this a "standard" answer in the Chinese? However, with the white stone at K4, black can not expect to gain much out of this.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr]C[fun - Black continues with the standard pattern but the result is a weak position that white fails to take advantage of. Black can only extend at S2 when the position is stronger to the left or we expect to strengthen it with an extention later.]
;W[qm];B[rl];W[om];B[nk];W[mm]
(;B[cc]C[fun - There just can not be time for this. Black is too thin on the LR.]

(;W[lq];B[mq];W[lp];B[lr];W[kr]C[fun - Black sighs with relief. White has forced black to protect the LR weakness and lost sente doing so.]
;B[cn]
(;W[co]C[fun - Gives black the perfect extension to C10 without securing the corner. Consider how you would have answered some alternatives here (variations).]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[cj];W[ch];B[ej]C[fun - The exchange of w C12 for b E10 looks very good for black.  White did not stabilize the UL while black has become very strong.]
;W[oq]C[fun - Beginning with this play, white patches the remaining holes in black's lower left, once again giving up sente to do so. Black is presented with the opportunity to take the initiative in the UL.]

(;B[fd];W[jc];B[hc];W[lb]
(;B[rd]C[fun - Too late for this because white has played M18. White doesn't take advantage of it properly however.]

;W[le];B[kc]C[I expected white to answer at l18 so that I could save my stones by playing n16.
That was silly of me ...];W[mc];B[ib];W[jb];B[rc]C[fun - Even less of a threat than last time since white has captured the 4 black stones. It looks too late for a black play at C3, but I wouldn't be able to resist throwing a stone in there just to see how white would reply!  Otherwise, to what extent can black limit white's center?]
