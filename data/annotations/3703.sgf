Hi --

I reviewed this game in CGoban.  It is the newest version so I had a little trouble labelling variations.  I hope that everything can be viewed just fine.  If not please feel free to write with questions.

Please take my advice with the knowledge that I am not a professional and that I make many mistakes myself.  Therefore, I am much more effective at telling you why a move is wrong than what the perfect move should have been.

LB[pf:a]TR[pd]C[krv: Joseki move is a. Is my move bad?

Playing at a (Q14) puts more pressure on white.  Now it is harder to attack white since your marked stones have a large gap in them.

Since the whole purpose of your pincer at M17 is to pressure white, playing at Q14 would be consistent with your previous move.]
;W[le]LB[ic:A][jc:B]
(;B[ic]C[K17 seems slow but it is more solid and therefore probably better here.  It is easiest to attack when you have no weaknesses.  White should have no problem living since you are not 100% solid on either side.

See variation.];W[mh];B[hq]C[krv: Is it right to play here now? Or I should attack play upright white group?

Upper right group hard to kill now.  However, I think that C14 is better than your move.  Why?  Because it is better to attack in place where you outnumber your opponent.  You attacked white's F3 stone, but the F3 stone is light (he can always jump in the corner), plus he has a friend nearby.]
;W[cq]LB[cp:B][dq:A]
(;B[dq]TR[qp][kq]C[Blocking this way may not be great since you can't really develop your wall with white's marked stones already there.

When you have a stone at D10 always consider blocking the other way.

Taking in account weak M15 group, potential moyo between D10 and K10 and sente we can consider game as even.
Is this right?

Well I think the white M15 group is alive.  See variation at L12.

The problem is that the wall of marked stones you have in the middle are hard to use when there is nothing to attack.]

(;B[no]C[krv: seems like now H5 is catched and thus I'm winning. Is this right? Where I lose my chances to win?


Seems difficult.  It is white's move and if he plays correctly he can play  J7, a nice shape making move.  

see variation.];W[jm]LB[kl:B][im:A]
(;B[im]C[krv: Is this move good?

If you are sure you can kill this way then play it.  Otherwise, the proverb "do not attack by touching" holds.  Here your touching allows white to make shape.]

;B[sm];W[rm];B[sn];W[rn]C[Summary:

You are good at starting attacks, but you need to protect your stones a little better.  Often you will attack your opponent's weak stones, but it is your stones that end up being vulnerable.

Go is a very unforgiving game.  One bad move can completely ruin 20 previous good moves.  So when you get into the middle game, you need to take time to think since it is the most complicated part of the game.]
