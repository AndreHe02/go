C[Summary:

First of all you should learn to see which moves you should answer and where you can play tenuki (=not answer).

Second, when you attack, you should attack the weak groups, and you should do it in a way to get strong yourself.

Third, connect your groups.

PS: As far as I'm not as strong as I'd like to be, it is possible, that I sometimes don't see a strong move, or even worse, that I'm wrong in some places. But I hope, that most comments will help you.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[ed];W[qq];B[cn];W[fq]C[Correct response.];B[bp]
;W[cq]C[Correct again.];B[bq]C[This move is small, black should better play somewhere around D10.]

(;W[br]LB[cr:a][dm:b][cm:c][dl:d]C[This is the first time I would not have answered. When black continues at C2(a) then he'll get some profit in the corner (about 7 Points), but those move has no influence on the rest of the game, hence it's an endgamemove.

An other reason to play there would be, if your group had to live on it's own. But in this situation this is not the case.

A better move would be D7(b). This move puts much pressure on the three black stones, so white has to follow at C7(c) and you can build thickness at D8(d).
A few months ago I would have feared, that black cuts my stone at D7(b), but that is not good for black. (See variation)]
;B[cg];W[cj]LB[cg:a][ej:b][dm:c][dk:d][qf:e][kp:f][pj:g]C[Without any response of black, this stone is under pressure, because of C13(a). If black now plays E10(b), your stone is probably useless.

If you want to attack the lower black group --which is the correct idea-- you should attack from outside: D7(c) or D9(d). The first of them presses black to the edge and you will get much influence. The second will separate the two groups and build pressure from above, so black has to go to the center.

An other way to play is to let it be as it is and play one of those: R14(e), L4(f), Q10(g).]
;B[cl];W[bh]LB[ej:a][ek:b]C[Wrong way. This move helps black to build a wall and you gain nothing from it (probably some trouble, but thats not what we are looking for ;-).

The correct way here is to go outside with E10(a) or even with E9(b) which puts more pressure on the lower black group.]
;B[bg];W[ch]TR[bh][ch][cj]C[Again I would jump out. As you can see, the three marked stones are overconcentrated C10 should be at C8.]
;B[eg]C[Now black puts pressure on your group and gets strength himself.]
;W[eh]LB[ej:a]C[Ok, but I would have played E10(a) or somewhere there. It will put more pressure at the lower black group and does not strengten the upper black group.]
;B[fg];W[gc]TR[bg][cg][eg][fg]LB[jc:a][cc:b][fh:c]C[Attack the weak groups (the stone at Q16 and the lower left group are weak). Because of the marked wall the upper black group is strong. If black plays K17(a) he has a good extension from Q16 and a very good attack at your stone.

If black sometimes defends his corner, than you should be happy and take an other big point. If black doesn't defend, than lateron you can play C17(b) and get a small group at the corner. You should not be in hurry to do so, because this move (C17) helps black to build a large wall to the outside.

And: Here I wouldn't play tenuki, because black F12(c) would bring your group in much trouble.]
;B[dd]C[Slow move.];W[ec]LB[jc:a]C[K17(a) and your group is almost save.]
;B[dc];W[fc];B[em];W[ek]C[Now this move is to late. (It has only defensive meaning.)]
;B[bj];W[bi]C[This is one of the moves I mentioned in the summary at the beginning. What harm could black B10 do? None!

If you fear life of your group, then jump out into the center.
Or you can attack Q16.];B[bk];W[ck]C[Another slow move. Take sente and attack Q16.]
;B[fh];W[ei]C[ok];B[ge];W[id]C[good];B[hq];W[jq]LB[jp:a]C[the pincer is good here, but I would go at K4(a). This puts more pressure at H3 and is a better extension to R3.]
;B[dl];W[el]LB[gp:a]C[D8 is a small move. I would not have answered. Instead I would have played at G4(a).

Anyway, E8 is better than D9 which might come first into mind.]
;B[fm];W[gk]LB[gl:a]C[G8(a) might be better, but I'm not strong enough to tell.]
;B[fj]
(;W[fk]TR[ek][el][gk]LB[gl:a]C[This is a standard situation (the marked stones). Most times the bamboo-connection at G8(a) is better than the other two posibilities at F9 or F8. (Only if liberties count, they might be better.)

Your group is still connected, see variation.];B[fi];W[ej]C[Correct (here you have made a bamboo).]
;B[bc]C[very slow move (I think pass would be even better.)]
;W[qj]C[good move];B[qo]
(;W[qm]LB[op:a][qo:b][ql:c]C[I don't know the josekis for 3/3, but I'd play at P4(a) that puts much pressure at R5(b) (and even if he can live with R8(c) you can attack it from the outside and get a big wall. See Variation.]
;B[pm];W[qn];B[pn];W[ro];B[qp];W[rp];B[pq];W[qr];B[op]C[Now black has build a big wall and you got only some points at the edge.]
;W[mq]C[good];B[nq];W[nr]LB[lo:a]C[I would go for the center again probably at M5(a).]
;B[or];W[np];B[oq]C[I would not have answered as black, because this ko isn't much worth.]
;W[mr]LB[mp:a][no:b]C[This move is slow. If black N2, then you M2, black has to play O1 and you have sente again.

Better: N4(a) or O5(b).];B[mp];W[no];B[mo];W[nn];B[mm]
(;W[lp]TR[qo][qp]C[Here you can get R5/R4 in sente. See variation.]
;B[mn];W[os]C[This is another endgame-move. It's to early to play them. At the top right, there is a lot of virgin territory. Play there!]

(;B[on]C[This move isn't really necessary. See variation.];W[pl]
C[OK];B[nm];W[ol]C[ok, but no thread!];B[ps];W[qs]C[There are bigger points at the top right.]

;W[lc];B[kc]
(;W[jc]LB[kd:a]C[This move helps black to build a wall. Try L16(a) (see variation).]
;B[kd];W[if];B[ld];W[qc]LB[qf:a]C[R14(a) would be a good extension to R10 and an attack too. The 3/3-invasion normaly helps black to build a wall.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[rc];W[oc];B[od];W[nb];B[qb];W[mc];B[nd];W[pb]
LB[kb:a][pc:b]C[Here I would connect at L18(a). Than both white groups at the top have no more trouble. (Ok, he will get the three stones arround Q17(b), but I think connection is still better.)]
;B[pa];W[ob];B[lb]C[Now they are separated and have to live at their own.]
;W[rb]C[Good move!];B[rd];W[sb];B[mb];W[qa];B[qh]C[Now black can use his wall and build territory, where yours should have been.]
;W[ri]C[Again you help him.];B[rh];W[pi]C[Later you played N15. I think that now would have been the time to do so.]
;B[qi];W[sj];B[oj]
(;W[hi]LB[ci:a][gl:b][hm:c]C[Your left group is secure. It has one eye at C11(a) and one at either G9(b) or H7(c).

Now I think is the last chance to win, because if you let black have the territory at the upper right, black leads too much.

See variation.];B[pj];W[qk];B[lh];W[kk];B[mk];W[me]TR[lh]C[Because of M12 black hasn't to answer in the expected way. This move is too late.

Note: This move is called kikashi. A kikashi-move is a forcing move, that has to be answered. With kikashi-moves it is very important to get the timing right.]
;B[kf];W[kh];B[lg];W[li];B[mi];W[lj];B[mj]C[I've counted points. You are about 30 points back. I think, now you can't win this game anymore.]
;W[km]LB[sh:a][ag:b][db:c]C[Anyway, the big points are:

T12(a), A13(b), D18(c)

I would play them in this order, because D18 is a gote move, then it's blacks turn.]
