AB[dd][pd][dp]C[This is a game that I played at my local go club last month. I'm Black with 3-handi. Although I typically play around a 5-kyu, I felt I played much worse that day ... I was sadly a bit intimidated by my opponent. He's improved so quickly over the last few years, and since he hadn't come to the club in a few months his strength was (is) a bit of a intimidating mystery to me. So if you could also let me know where you think he stands, then that could be an added bonus--making me feel better when we play each other in the future.

Please comment on any moves when you feel.

Thank-you so much : )
John

----------------------------------

* Hello John! I'll be your reviewer for this game, and hope you will enjoy the comments (sorry in advance for my own mistakes).

* I believe that you lost this game because you made wrong assessments of positions, leading to moves that were not bad locally, but inappropriate in their context.

* I would like to suggest you a technique. Each time it is your turn to play, try and read 5 moves ahead, as many variations as you wish (count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as you read moves). At the end of each sequence, assess the position (as black and as white). If you are not satisfied, then search for more severe moves, or consider tenuki. All the variations I will propose in the review will be 5 moves long max. (so that you can see how it can help during the game).]

C[My main goal was to just build solid groups and not let White complicate the game. But this didn't seem to work in the end. Any advice about this throughout the game would be helpful. Thank-you.

* This is an excellent idea, applicable to any kind of game (handicap or regular). When you are solid (i.e. have good shape), you may attack a lot and gain advantage (territory, influence...). When you are weak, you cannot do anything and usually get chased around.

* Q14 is fine. You could also play A (securing the corner, putting pressure on white) or B.]
;W[pb];B[lc];W[ne]
(;B[qc]LB[le:A]C[Just trying to play solid with R17, but now M17 felt bad to me. Is there something else I could have done?

* M17 means that you want to split white, and R17 means that you want to corner. These are two different (playable) ideas, but I don't think that you can have both at the same time. Here, I would rather stick to the original plan, and jump at M15.]
(;W[kd];B[he]LB[dj:A]C[* I think that this move lacks a bit of direction. White is already strong at the top, so this move does not threaten his group. Also, since the upper left corner remains open, it does not assert lots of territory. Why not play on the left side, which is completely open?

* Direction of play can be determined using a proverb: "play away from strength". When you have a strong group, play away from it. This way, you build some area of influence, and if the opponent enters, you can smash him against your strong group. This holds true for your opponent's group, too. Do not play too close to your opponent's strong groups, or you'll be pincered and eventually smashed.

* A consequence of the proverb can be: "play close to weak groups". Play close to your weak groups in order to improve their shape, and play close to your opponent's weak groups in order to spoil their shape (remove eyeshape or base), so that the groups can be harassed later.]
;W[cn];B[ck];W[fp];B[dn];W[cq];B[co];W[dq];B[bn]C[Is B6 too slow? Should I have played elsewhere?

* No, B6 is fine. If you do not reinforce your shape here, white will damage it and you'll eventually have to run.

* This illustrates another proverb: "urgent moves come before big moves". Urgent moves are related to improving one's shape or spoiling the opponent's, and big moves increase your area of influence or reduce the opponent's. B6 (or C7) can be considered urgent moves here, so it's correct to play them.]
;W[cd]
(;B[ce]C[* I would block from C17. Not only would it give you territory on the top, but also it would force white to take position on the left side, where you already have a strong group (white would not respect the proverb, as he would be forced to play close to your strong group!).

* White would have problems: make life without possibility to harass your groups around (since you'd be strong anywhere), and little prospect of territory. See variations for illustration.]
;W[be]
(;B[bd]C[* I do not really like this atari, because it helps white make shape and get an opening to the center. Why not atari at C17, or connect at D15?]
;W[cc];B[bf];W[de];B[cf];W[bc]
(;B[ee]C[* Again, you diverge from your original plan :) Why not just capture at A15?]
;W[df];B[dc]LB[ed:A]C[* This leaves a weakness at A. I would prefer to connect at E16, or maybe at E17.]
;W[ad];B[lp]C[* M4 is an interesting move! It reduces white's area of influence at the bottom, and improve black's influence on the right side.

* Note, however, that it is not a ladder breaker for the D14 stones. But why would white want to save the D14 stones anyway? They cut two healthy black groups, so getting them out would simply mean a weak group for white (and no weak group for black). We'll see that shortly.]
;W[dg]
(;B[lq]C[* This move is a mistake, probably the losing move of the game. You must save the C14 group by jumping at C12. This way, you will secure territory on the left side, and white will have a floating group in the center.]
;W[ci]C[My strategy on the top left was to keep H3/H15 solid, while using a ladder breaker to handle White's bottom. The White bottom appeared larger than what Black could gain the left. But ... W39 surprised me, when he ignored the bottom and just played on the left.

* When you are suprised by a move, it is important to take a pause to understand the move (why the opponent played it, what does he expect from it), and assess the global situation. Generally, it is also a good time to count points. Let's do that:
- black: 5 on the left, 10 on the top left, 15 on the top right = 30 points of territory, no weak groups,
- white: 20 on the left, 15 on the bottom left, 15 on the top = 50 points of territory. weak in the bottom right corner.

* White's choice is excellent here, he's now leading on territory and only has to take care of the corner. His C11 keima may not be tight enough, but that's clearly manageable for now.]
(;B[hq]C[* You play close to your weak black group (good!) but close to your opponent's strong group (bad!). While H3 certainly helps your group, I would say that it is not severe enough. Why not another direction, like N2 (close to the opponent's weak group)? You would undermine white's base while helping your own stones. Or you could also invade at R3.]
;W[fq]C[* This is solid but probably gote. I would prefer G3 for white, to get sente and play in the lower right corner first.]
;B[ho]C[* H5 would be fine if your bottom group was in danger; but it isn't. White N3 and Q4 are weak, so it is urgent to attack them!]
(;W[fn];B[ek]C[In retrospect, I think doing something with the lower-right corner is best now (since White looks weak there), but I'm not sure where to begin.

* Yes! Anything in the corner is good :) Start with N2, or invade with R3, as you wish.]
;W[qo]
(;B[oq]C[* This move is a mistake. You must block with Q6 here. This way, you would secure territory on the right side, improve your influence in the center, and white would still have to live in the corner.]
;W[pn]TR[qn][qo][pp]C[* White makes the tiger's mouth, his shape is much better now (good eye potential, open ot the center).]
;B[qm];W[pm];B[ro];W[rp];B[rn];W[qk]C[W53 surprised me.

* It's a standard capture move, which you often find in tesuji problems. When you want to capture stones, you do not play too close to them (it's the underlying idea of the "geta", you cast a net to get the fish!).]
;B[ql];W[pk];B[rk];W[rj];B[pl];W[ol]
(;B[ok]C[I think B60 should just settle the group now. This was the 'intimidation' getting to me :p, I felt I couldn't be pushed around esp. since I had a stronger surrounding position.

* Yes, white has lots of problems to solve, so a calm move at S8, making life, is correct.

* Remember the principle: "attack from strong positions", so always reinforce before attacking. Attacking from a weak position means that your opponent will be able to attack your own weaknesses while defending himself, and maybe hurt you more than you hurt him.]

C[What is the purpose of R15? The game didn't get far enough for me to see it move.

* I don't know (it's a probe), but the Q11 cut is dangerous, so R15 may come handy in some variations. Your protecting the cut removes most of the bad aji added by R15. It's good.]

Thank-you so much for the review.

* Thank you for submitting the game! I hope you have enjoyed the review, and that it will help you improve your go. About the right handicap, I think that your friend is dan level (2d?), so try with 5 stones, and see if he can handle it.]
