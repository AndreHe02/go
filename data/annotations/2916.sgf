RE[B+Resign]

C[Dear reviewer,

I'm Walther, taking black, and I am around 5-6k but am progressing pretty quickly so I am not sure. This game was recorded after I went home from the club, so there my be some timing issues, but all the shapes are correct. I already went over this game a little, but I would appreciate if you could show me some variations for joseki in the two corners, and also some better developments in the opening. After the opening I felt very uncomfortable, but tried to make the best moves. I welcome any comments, especially since I felt like this game was a little weird. I usually play good shape, but there was lots of strange stuff. Incidentally, even though I won by resign, I think it was close if I hadn't killed a group on my last move, so there were no intentionally slack moves :)

Thanks for the review

Walther

crux: Hi, my name is Bernd; I'm 1d on a good day. I hope this review will be useful.  Please use an sgf viewer that easily allows you to see which nodes have variations.  I recommend qgo or ggo; Jago and cgoban1 also seem to work fine, but I've noticed that cgoban2 (the KGS client) will not display this sgf file properly.

You need to work on ensuring your groups have eye space, especially if there is an easy way to achieve this.  If your groups are secure, you have much greater freedom on the board to play any move you like.  In this game, White didn't take enough advantage of the weakness of your groups, but stronger players will.

Also, you should try not to play close to strong stones (yours or your opponent's).]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dp];W[dc];B[op];W[lq]C[crux: This pincer does not exist in professional play.  I guess this means Black should expect to get a good result.]
;B[qo]C[not joseki

crux: Ignoring the M3 stone, which doesn't seem to affect things much, this is one possible joseki.]
;W[ro];B[po];W[qn]LB[qq:C][rn:A][rp:B]C[crux: There are two standard continuations: at S6 (A) for corner territory, and S4 (B) for outside influence (depending on a ladder).

Since the ladder doesn't work for Black, and there doesn't appear to be a severe ladder breaker, I would choose to go for territory immediately.

Tenuki may not be an option.  A white move at R4 (C) would secure profit and leave Black's stones rather heavy.]

(;B[de]
(;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb]LB[ch:A][ci:B]C[crux: So far it's a standard joseki.  The normal continuation is at C12 (A) or C11 (B), to secure a base for Black's stones.]
;B[hd]LB[qq:A]C[should be around c12, I think. I was trying to get a ladder breaker, but maybe I didn't really need it

crux: This move is the wrong direction - don't play close to strong stones.  H16 is now a weak stone next to a strong white group.  It does not even work as a ladder breaker, since it does not require a local response; White could just go and play R3 (A) now.]
;W[cg]C[crux: This is quite severe.  Black shouldn't have allowed it.]
;B[dg]LB[ef:B][fe:A]C[crux: When defending, you usually you want to attach to strong stones rather than weak ones.  In this case, this means playing at F15 (A).  Another option in some situations could be E14 (B)  In the game, the white pincer stone is strengthened by the attachment.]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[cf]LB[ee:A]C[crux: Consider a move at E15 (A).  No doubt it's a bit heavy, but leaves White with fewer forcing moves against your group.]

(;B[fe]TR[cf][cg][dg][eg]C[crux: Go back four moves.  Consider the exchange of the marked black stones for the marked white ones - this seems to be clearly good for White, indicating that Black shouldn't have played this exchange if he was eventually going to play F15 anyway.]
;W[dd];B[ce];W[ee];B[ef]C[maybe directly at d14];W[ed];B[ch]
LB[df:A]C[crux: Unfortunately this cut doesn't work out so well; it just strengthens White who can capture the cutting stone.  I don't think Black can avoid to connect at D14 (A) now.]
;W[ci];B[bh];W[bi];B[eh];W[di];B[df];W[bg];B[bf];W[ah]C[crux: A terrible result for Black.]

(;B[rp];W[rq];B[rn];W[sp];B[qm];W[oq]
(;B[pq]C[bad!

crux: Yes.  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much to be gained for Black with either hane.  Capturing the ladder stone is tempting - it may be a little slow, but Black becomes very thick and leaves no aji for White to exploit.  After that maybe one of the two hanes becomes playable.]
;W[pp]C[crux: I'm adding a couple of random variations here.  I think White will get a reasonable result out of them all.]

(;B[np];W[pn];B[oo];W[rm];B[nq];W[lr]LB[or:A]C[crux: A strange move.  Of course, it aims at pulling out P2 (A), but it just encourages Black to capture there himself.]

(;B[lo]C[how is this move? I didn't want the group to become too weak

crux: This move seems to achieve very little other than running out a bit and inducing White to make a base for himself.  Better to make an eye for these stones quickly when there's a simple way to do so. If Black can live locally, a stone at M5 is too close.  How about the variations?]
;W[hq];B[cm]LB[cn:B][dp:A][fq:C]C[wanted to prevent white extensions from both sides. Is this too close to thickness?

crux: The D4 stone (A) definitely needs some help now, so the general idea seems OK to me.  Holding back one line by playing at C6 (B) would have the advantage of leaving White only a ko for life in the corner when he plays the 3-3 invasion.  It also stays a bit further away from White's thickness, as you correctly noticed.

Another option is F3 (C), to put pressure on White's group.]
;W[or]C[crux: This is quite big because Black becomes eyeless.]
;B[nr];W[pr]
(;B[rl]LB[om:A]C[crux: This move has very little purpose, and it is aji-keshi. Consider, as potential alternative for later, a move at P7 (A) which could help you make some shape in the center.]
;W[sn];B[qf]C[At this point, I have zero points of territory, white has about 35. Plus, two of my groups are weak and inefficient. I did not follow joseki on either side, it really cost me. comeback time!

crux: Counting 35 points for White seems generous.  There may be potential for this much, but I'd count secure territory as less than 30 points.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[cr];B[fq];W[bq];B[bp];W[dq];B[cp];W[ep]C[black can cut?

crux: Looks like it.]
(;B[eo];W[fp];B[gp];W[gq];B[fo];W[eq];B[iq]C[crux: You are attaching to a very strong group here.  This will not achieve anything if White plays correctly.]

(;W[hp]
(;B[jp]C[is this best?

crux:  Maybe.  If you can capture the two stones, your group becomes alive, so it's not small.]
;W[kp];B[jo];W[ir];B[jr];W[ip];B[jq];W[ls];B[hr];W[ns];B[gr]

(;W[go]LB[gr:B][ko:A]C[not necessary, I don't think. although otherwise black might get good thickness?

crux: I'd be slightly worried that White might decide to push through at L5 (A).  I'd prefer a move there to the previous crawl at G2 (B)]
;B[oc]C[crux: Big, but it took three moves to secure this corner.]
;W[jc];B[kd]C[comeback time! so far, white has same amount of territory, but I got a big move in (20 points of territory), plus much more influence, although it's still a little hard to work with]
;W[kh]C[crux: This white move doesn't seem to threaten much.  I've made a few variations to show possible moves for Black.]
