C[pz- greetz!

i'm pzykr; all my comments will be preceeded with "pz-" so they're easy to spot.
under a different name i'm 9kyu on kgs

i will refer to most moves by their number rather than the location on the board.  b1 is black's first move, not the location B1 in the bottom left corner of the board.  in this game b1 is on Q16.  because i follow this convention it will be a great advantage to you to set your sgf viewer to "show all move numbers."

good  luck! :)];B[pd]C[pz- this is only w's fourth game? really??

black won by only two and a half points after the devastating kill in the lower right: very impresssive for a fourth game, and against a rated opponent.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[cd]C[pz- normal opening so far. the japanese word for the opening, "fuseki," explains by its very meaning the general idea behind moves in the opening: fuseki means "scattering about" of stones around the board.]
;B[qj]C[pz- an unusual opening, based on a database search of over 50,000 pro games.  in all those games, black only played this way 3 times.

if b3 and b5 are each played one point towards the bottom of the board the popular and well-researched chinese fuseki results.

another idea would be for b to use b5 to "split" the other side of the board and w's position there by playing at C10.

perhaps, though, the most common play for experienced players would be to answer w4 in the upper left corner, to prevent w from setting up a comfortable base of operations: either at E17 (the keima kakari, preventing the shimari [see next note for definitions of these terms\]) or the one-space approach move at E16.]
;W[oq]C[pz- a decidedly unusual response. succintly: too close. the "normal" move is a small-knght approach ("keima kakari") at O3.

some folks would recommend instead of an approach move here it would be best to complete the w shape in the upper left corner. a play at E17 completes a corner enclosure, or "shimari."

both moves have merit; it depends on one's style and on the overall strategy one is pursuing which move to choose. and no, it's not too early in the game to be considering long-term strategy; as a matter of fact, if one hasn't already done so one is remiss.

pros always spend more time in the early opening than in any other phase of the game.  openings are important!]
;B[qq]C[pz- a passive move; not recommended. it does have the property of securing the corner, but then why not just play there directly instead of placing the now rather useless stone at b3?]
;W[dc]C[pz- misplaced. see earler note on shimari. this move is too small and is therefore inefficient.]
;B[jp]C[pz- as a kind of pincer of w6, b9 is pretty loose. it is, though, played on the large point ("oba") at K4 ("hoshi"), which is a good thing: just, is it good enough?]
;W[mp]C[pz- fine move. it breaks the loose connection between b3 and b9 by playing directly on the sector line. (for more on sector lines see "E-Z Go" by Bruce Wilcox.)

it could be argued, though, that better would have been w10 at M3. this sets up a base which is pretty close to alive already, or is at least difficult to kill. 

this is an important shape to know: two stones of the same color on the third line, with two spaces between them. very strong!]
;B[gp]C[pz- not close enough to put real pressure on w2, too high (far from the edge of the board) to effectively make territory: what was the thinking/strategy behind b11?]
;W[fp]C[pz- for what purpose does w touch b's stone here? if the intent is to attack: NO. the proverb says not to touch stones one is attacking. (obviously as the fight progresses the stones will come into contact; but that should only be after one has prepared the area by placing stones nearby that will help the cut-and-thrust of contact battle.)

if the intent is to make shape and settle the corner quickly, ok; that's an acceptable reason to make a contact play.

another response w might have considered would be the rather "normal" one-point extention to D6. since b11 is a bit too far away from w2 and too high, this move could work quite well.]
;B[cj];W[ck]C[pz- again with a contact play! what's the purpose?

normal response would be at C7 or perhaps C8. the latter move might incur more risk, as black has the two high (fourth-line) stones at the bottom.]
;B[cn]C[pz- risky, maybe, but "nothing ventured nothing gained." puts w14 in an awkward position and makes a traditional keima kakari against w2. i haven't looked ahead to see how this works out, but i personally like this move.]
;W[co]C[pz- this is a normal move, even though it's a direct-contact move, because it settles, or almost does, w's shape in the lower left. the nearly automatic move for black would be to push up to D6. let's see what b does...]
;B[bn]C[pz- right idea, wrong direction, though it seems playable--depending on how it fits in with b's overall strategy for the left. it's just a little early to be playing second-line moves...]
;W[bk]C[pz- similar remarks here as last move. this gives black an excellent opportunity to "strike at the head of two stones" by playing at D9]
;B[dl]C[pz- this invites w to push up to D9 and cut b's stones apart.]
;W[dn]C[pz- w missed the opportunity. important tactically, one should always be looking for moves that cut the opponent's stones from one another or that insure connection for one's own stones.

cutting and connecting: never forget! it should be a consideration ~every move~]
;B[dm];W[en];B[dk];W[di]C[pz- no! play the cut on the hoshi (D10). the played move almost forces w to connect. why help one's opponent?]
;B[ci]C[pz- this move surprised me...];W[ch];B[dj]C[pz- cutting and connecting: b is connected, w's two stones (w24 and w26) are cut and weak. not to mention how lonely w14 and w18 are looking...]
;W[cg];B[bj]C[pz- very ugly shape. attacking by attaching! these two stones would best be given up by w and not defended.]
;W[bh]C[pz- i can grasp no purpose to this move. much better would have been a play on the last oba (large point) on the upper hoshi (K16)]
;B[ak];W[bo];B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[al];B[aj];W[ah]C[pz- very small, useless move... and quite overlooks the weakness at B4]
;B[bl];W[em];B[cl]C[pz- a purely wasted move--b may as well have just passed.

this looks like a good place to discuss efficiency. notice how many moves b has invested on the left to surround 6 points. 15 stones.  a certain way to lose is to make strong walls around small areas...

on the other hand, just underneath b's shape w has invested 8 stones and is fairly assured, with accurate play, of getting at least 17 points. (of course, that means protecting the stone w34...)

15stones/8points vs 8stones/17points. lopsided ratios...

this is one meaning of "efficiency."

next, almost the only move on the board for w is at or near K16]
;W[gq]C[pz- oh well...];B[hp];W[hq];B[iq];W[ir];B[jq]C[pz- classic "bad shape." this is called an empty triangle, and provokes a slightly different discussion of efficiency.

b's three stones, b9, b45, and b47, in this position have only 5 liberties. suppose b47 had been played just one point lower, on K2: b would have 6 liberties. another perspective on efficiency has to do with liberty counts and good shape. if b K2, he has more liberties AND two nice-looking "tiger's mouths" at J4 and K3.

also, K2 makes a connection between the w lower left group and the two lonely w stones on the right less likely.

in the shape actually played, if w later peeps at J5 and b "closes the door" by playing at J4, b is left with a truly ugly mess of stones known as a "dongo" or dumpling and, so far, no eye shape.]
;W[jr];B[lo]C[pz- w should thank b! if w responds correctly, the two w stones on the right are no longer in trouble.]
;W[ko]C[pz- does w have a specific purpose, a definite plan, in making this move?]
;B[jo];W[kn];B[jn];W[kp];B[mo]C[pz- the point L3 is screaming at both sides: "play me!"]
;W[op];B[oo];W[no];B[nn];W[np];B[km];W[on];B[po];W[mn];B[nm]
;W[mm];B[lp];W[nl];B[ln];W[om];B[kq]C[pz- this turned out pretty well for both sides but shouldn't have!]
;W[ko]C[pz- placement move to try to kill b by playing on the center of three; however, b already has another potential eyespace around J4. essentially, a pass by w.]
;B[lq]C[pz- horribly inefficient! do the liberty count of this shape vs b73 at L2. however, even that would not have been as good a move as K16: the hoshi at the top has been neglected far too long...

i've reconsidered the above comment: b73 dropping down to L2 is not a bad move, as it mades w connecting with the stones on the right much more difficult.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[ks];B[mr];W[ls];B[ms];W[js]C[pz- it behooves one to "read ahead" a few moves, which is to say, "if i do this and s/he does that, and i respond thusly, and the opponent thataway..." etc. i don't know yet what happens next move: if b doesn't play on H2 and kill 6 w stones i may scream ;)]
;B[hr]C[pz- whew! glad i didn't have to hurt my throat :)];W[pl]
;B[is]C[pz- no! they're dead and cannot be resurrected: why waste a move to kill them? that's two essential passes by b now and one by w.

better for b would have been to respond to the threatened cut of b5 from the lower right corner.]
;W[fq]C[pz- let's pause for a moment and survey the whole board. (this should actually be done more often than once every 84 moves...)

b has surrounded territory, "cash," on the left and at the bottom. however, the right side stones are widely separated, cannot yet be counted on for territory, and invite attack. b has solidly surrounded 15 whole points...

on the other hand, w's lower left corner is worth around 20 points (if he protects w34!) and w looks like he has a good chance to secure 17 more points in the upper left. so the score, very roughly, is about 37-w, 15-b.  this implies that b needs to fight hard to make up the difference, while w can simply play safely and coast to an easy win.

if only it were so simple! in high dan games, it DOES look simple! (it's not! finding the simple, effective strategies, tactics, and moves requires a lot of brain sweat...)]
;B[gr]C[pz- need i say "small?"];W[fr];B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[er]
;B[qn]C[pz- in a good direction, though not the best move to connect with b5 above. but leaving the corner alone is not an option: w's group in the lower right poses a real threat.

incidentally, b throwing in a stone (sacrificing it) by playing on O6 would deprive w of the eye at O6 and O7. this is called "the eye-stealing tesuji." tesuji, sometimes translated as "finesse," means the best play, to accomplish specific objectives, in a given shape. objectives include cutting, connecting, living, and killing.]
;W[ql]C[pz- great move by w. slices right between b5 and the lower right corner.]
;B[rl]C[pz- too late now for b to connect...];W[rk];B[rm];W[qk]
;B[rj];W[sk]C[pz- the cut is complete, though w could have played also on T8 or (better) T10 and the cut would still hold.]
;B[sj]C[pz- presumably, b doesn't want w to run up the right side of the board. why? stones played on the first line make 0 points! this move gives w a chance to strike at the head of three stones, at Q10...]
;W[or]C[pz- ineffecient. striking at the head of three stones would have been big. the move played was extremely small: at least one might have played at Q2 to have ~some~ effect of b... and might even have been able to make an eye on the bottom, though such a plan is way too small for the position this game has progressed to.]
;B[pr];W[os];B[ps];W[pq];B[qr];W[rs]C[pz- i fail to grasp the purpose and significance of this move]
;B[rr];W[pn];B[qo];W[qm];B[rn];W[sl];B[sm];W[kl]C[pz- attacking? don't touch! trying to make shape? what if b plays M8 next?

upper hoshi still unoccupied. but more urgent than that ("urgent before big") is for w to strike the head of the three weak b stones in the center-right.]
;B[jl];W[kk];B[jk]C[pz- b follows passively along, "pushing from behind."]
;W[jj]C[pz- and w strikes at the head of two stones];B[ij];W[ki]
C[pz- in many cases, when the opponent is "pushing from behind," it presents a good opportunity for a "double hane." in this position that would mean w120 played at J11. don't know how that would actually work out in this position, but it's always worth at least considering the double hane in this kind of shape.]
;B[ji];W[kj];B[jg];W[ii];B[jh];W[ik];B[hj];W[hi];B[gj];W[ej]
;B[ei];W[fi];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[fj];B[fk]C[pz- comments less frequent during "chuban" (the middle game), but this absolutely has to be pointed out: instead of b137, b should push up between w128 and w132. cutting! w cannot play at G12 because then w124 and w128 die. probably die anyway, without G12...

read!];W[ek];B[fl];W[el];B[fm];W[eo]C[pz- too passive. F6 would have more expanded w's territory, and leaves "aji" (literally "taste," aji refers to latent possibilities in positions that might be exploited for gain later).

[can you see what "latent possibilities might have been created?\]]
;B[fn];W[fo];B[go]C[pz- time for another look at the whole board...

b now has (more-or-less) surrounded about 44 points. w has 17 points in the lower left (unless b notices the move at B4), now, and still has maybe 17 points in the upper left---with correct play. the lower-right group of w doesn't show much potential to be expanded UNLESS w attacks b all-out on the right side.

at this point, w's large lead has eroded--in large because of passive play like w100 and w102.]
;W[gi];B[il];W[dg];B[hk]C[pz- that's the third essential pass by b by my count---completely wasted move]
;W[im]C[pz- playing inside b's sphere of influence? suicidal unless there's a very specific forcing pattern i don't see...]
;B[hm]C[pz- the proper defense];W[gl];B[gk];W[gm];B[gn]C[pz- these kinds of moves by w should be saved for ko threats. yes b must respond, but there is no real hope of killing anything here---against accurate play.]
;W[hn];B[hl]C[pz- completely unnecessary: it's a snap-back! (look back at the last move and it's easier to see the snap-back).

four passes...];W[lf]C[pz- i guess w sets sights on three lonely b stones in the center...]
;B[je];W[kd];B[jd];W[ke];B[kf];W[kg];B[jf];W[lg];B[kc];W[le]
;B[lc];W[jc]C[pz- there is no hope for this stone!];B[ic];W[id]
C[pz- w's turn to waste moves i guess...];B[jb];W[hd];B[hf]
;W[gg];B[hg];W[gh];B[hh];W[ge]C[pz- these past several moves in the center may have made a few points difference one way or the other, but the LARGE moves are on the right side and top right. Q10 has been neglected far, far too long...]
;B[gf];W[ff];B[ie];W[gd]C[pz- inefficient move, essentially a low-liberty empty triangle.]
;B[ih]C[pz- this move is worth, at most, one point... no, no, no! play LARGER moves! one-point moves are for the endgame ("yose"). 

the entire upper right quadrant has been almost completely neglected, and b is vulnerable to attack there. for example, w can play directedly on R17 ("san-san," the 3-3 point) and b could not prevent w from living in the corner. 

if w were to play somewhere around R13, he could make hay attacking the three weak b stones on the right.]
;W[fg];B[hc];W[gc];B[gb];W[fb];B[fa];W[ea];B[ga];W[eb];B[ne]
C[pz- a w play at H18 kills three... READ!];W[eg]C[pz- now w essentially passes. this is a passive move, attacks nothing, defends nothing vulnerable... what's its purpose?]
;B[bp]C[pz- this move has been waiting to be discovered for most of the game. it must feel good to wipe out w's terri. but let's look at it: w had 17 points here: this will take away how many?]
;W[bq];B[aq];W[cp];B[ap];W[br];B[ar];W[bs]C[pz- w now has only 9 points in the corner, but b didn't make a single new point! this tactic (it really doesn't rise to the level of "tesuji" because it depended on an oversight by w) only gives b 8 points (by taking them away from w: this is called "keshi" or erasing). compare to the number of points between, say, Q10 and the top of the board...

as far as the last move: w204 was "gote," which means b needn't respond at all--is completely free to play wherever. in other words, b now has the initiative ("sente'). it would be well worth giving up the extra point or two in the corner for w to take sente with w204 and get busy in the upper right.]
;B[as]C[pz- b205 is dame, worthless, no point value whatsoever. i've lost track of the virtual passes now...]
;W[cq]C[pz- worthless! if b plays there, b dies. w just decreased-voluntarily and unnecessarily- the territory in the lower left corner.]
;B[ng]C[pz- right direction! kinda-sorta closes in potential territory. as comparison, imagine a w stone here...]
;W[dr]C[pz- w passes...and loses another point.];B[nj]C[pz- feisty move, perhaps a little loose, though. one point further to the right and this stone would be of more help to the three weak stones on the right.]
;W[nh];B[oh];W[ni];B[oi];W[oj];B[pj];W[ok];B[mi];W[mh];B[mg]
;W[lh];B[li];W[mj];B[nk];W[pg]C[pz- b wasted several moves here, four dead stones to show for it.

however, as this sequence progressed, b became much stronger in the upper right.

peeping at the cutting point P13 (with w224) is not nearly so strong as simply cutting.]
;B[ph];W[mk]C[pz- unnecessary; w224 is looking pretty lonely!]
;B[og]C[pz- w still has the 3-3 invasion...];W[qg];B[qh];W[nf]
;B[mf];W[of];B[pf];W[pe];B[oe];W[qf];B[qe]C[pz- the chances of a successful invasion of the upper right have dropped to near nil, or maybe just nil...]
;W[me];B[md];W[nj]C[pz- this move was nowhere near necessary yet. and when it does become necessary, why not just kill b217 and b221?]
;B[ld];W[ll]C[pz- why not w242 on M7? every single point counts! the point w could have had here and w206 and w208 would have been enough to win the game in the end, as things turned out...]
;B[lm]C[pz- dame--worthless point, wasted move];W[ml]C[pz- worse than dame--another point of w's own territory gone...]
;B[nc]C[pz- granted, b245 makes nice shape: but does b really need to defend there or just gave a point away?

remember, H18 is still there!];W[nn]C[pz- not necessary at this point: all the dame around w's lower stones have to be filled in before this move is necessary. w has plenty of eyes here now and needn't worry about the eye-stealing tesuji.

let's pause to assess the overall board position now. w has quite a large terri in the upper left, a much smaller terri in the lower left, and about the same amout of terri in the middle-right. ignoring the move at H18, since no one sees it anyway, b has quite a large upper right--bigger than w's upper left--a good-sized chunk in the lower center, and about a dozen points in the lower right corner. b has a huge lead, around 60 points.

but as the dame start getting filled in at the end of the game, and liberties consequently decrease, opportunities for much mischief often arise!]
;B[rg];W[qc];B[qb];W[pb];B[rb];W[rc];B[pc];W[sb];B[ob];W[hb]
;B[fc]C[pz- the only move here was J18];W[fd];B[pa];W[rd];B[rf]
;W[re];B[se];W[cc]C[pz- i've ignored may small, useless, pointless plays in the past few moves, but this one, an empty triangle which only fills in w's terri, is especially worthy of comment...]
;B[qd];W[be]C[pz- last two moves broke even: both sides unnecessarily occupied their own terri...]
;B[he]C[pz- dame: completely useless point. what about w256? if w plays J18, even more damage done to b's terri.]
;W[kh]C[pz- dame, unnecessary, and see previous note for a better move...]
;B[ra];W[ja];B[jc];W[ib];B[ka];W[ha];B[ia];W[gb];B[ja];W[bb]
;B[jm];W[cr];B[mq];W[eq]C[pz- the number of useless moves that have just been played is impressive (irony alert:).]
;B[ee];W[de];B[tt];W[ss];B[sr];W[rp]C[pz--a serious threat--but only if not responded to properly. all b need do is connect at R4...]
;B[qs]C[pz_ what? why???];W[qp]C[pz- disaster! b loses the whole bottom right corner because of inaccurate play.]
;B[sp];W[ro];B[rq];W[sn];B[so];W[rn]C[pz- unnecessary; costs w a point.]
;B[tt];W[ss];B[tt];W[sq];B[tt];W[fe];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt];C[(SGF) cindy555 13k : Hi!

pz- the number of useless points that w played into his own territory is enough to have won the game had they not been played. though without the spectacular kill in the lower right, the game score was pretty lopsided in b's favor.

quick advice to both players: make every stone count!

both players showed good fighting spirit and each can be proud of his or her game :)

i hope my comments help you both get more enjoyment from the game of go. i hope reading them does you as much good as writing them has done me! thanks for giving me this opportunity to review another game for the go teaching ladder!]
