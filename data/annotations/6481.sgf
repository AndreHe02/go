C[Commented by Niall 2k kgs at the request of white.
Niall's comments preceded by "NM".];B[pc];W[dd];B[dq];W[pp]
;B[co];W[iq]C[NM: Good];B[fc];W[cf]C[NM: In this sort of open position I prefer C13 or D14.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[jd];W[pe]C[NM: This is the right area to play in.]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pg];B[nc];W[qk]C[P: looking back this was not the best choice I should have played at Q14 and then R10. This seems to be a better layout for my stones.

NM: Actually, I prefer this as leaving less room between R9 and Q4; but I don't think the difference is huge.]
;B[nq];W[lq]C[NM: This is OK. Given the empty space round J3, I would be inclined to play P4, because it turns the area round R9 into something very close to territory.]
;B[qn]C[NM: this feels like an overplay. What about simply answering R3, and then pushing through and cutting?]
;W[pn];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qm];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[po]
;W[oo];B[qo];W[on]C[P: I do not like my shape, it seems overconcentrated in the bottom.

NM: Well, yes - but once you'd played Q6 this was pretty well inevitable. At this point I think I would prefer Q7 to P6, but again a question of taste.]
;B[of];W[pf];B[oe];W[og]C[P: Looking back this move may been too slow, but invading the top did seem like good timing.

NM: A bit slow - it does give you one more line, about 6 points - but playing elsewhere should be worth more.]
;B[mf]C[P: Black seems to be doing much better than white, I can not get the initiative.

The top will be harder to invade now.

NM: You can still invade in all sorts of places (H17, M17, K17, J16 ...). 

In terms of territory, I think B is ahead, but only very slightly:

B about 24 points in TL, 5 in TR, 12 in BR, 11 in BL: 52, with excellent prospects on the top (e.g. F15 gains some 20 points)

W 16 on R, 10 at TR, 10 at B, 6.5 komi: 41.5, with good prospects on the L and sente.]
;W[mh]C[NM: Big, but F15 is bigger. I would either invade or reduce the top here. My move of choice would be H17.]
;B[ci]C[NM: Too close; W can reply C9, and the result will push W towards B's big area. C(9, or even C8, would be better. But I think F15 better still.]
;W[hc]C[NM: This is what I would have wanted to do, but I think I would have exploited the overextension of C11 first, by an exchange something like W C9, B E11, W13 first. Otherwise you give B the chance to chase out your H17 stone and turn C11 into a good move.

But that is very much a matter of taste.];B[fe];W[jc]C[NM: There are many possibilities, including K18, J16, H15. This is likely to leave W a bit heavy, but it's certainly playable.]
;B[kc];W[id];B[kd];W[he]C[P: this group could have been very heavy, but again white seems cramped in black's area.

NM: Yes, W is heavy and cramped - tends to happen after invasions. As long as the B F17 group is not alive, W shouldn't worry.

Here I would have played the other hane K15 or nikken tobi J14 - but this achieves the objective.]
;B[fg]C[NM: ... which is what I was afraid of.];W[hg]C[NM: Here I would definitely prefer J13, as getting more breathing room.]
;B[kg];W[ji]C[I struggled to find the best move here. Not severe?

NM: Come on! You can't try to be severe when you're being chased and there are no weak enemy groups around. But I don't like this move - it seems to me neither to extend the R moyo nor to link to the H17 group. On the other hand if B cuts one link it'll reinforce the other, so it's possible.

I thinkI would play L11 and then K18.];B[ki];W[jh]C[NM: You are trying to gain support for the H17 group, but you risk making it easier for B to invade your only big moyo. This move is playable,]
;B[kh];W[kj]C[NM: ... but I think this is wrong. The hane is an attacking move, and you're not attacking anything. If you really want to attack, play D12o or E12. Otherwise, defend at G11 and then play somewhere round N9.]
;B[jj]C[NM: B should play M10 or N11.];W[ij]C[NM: Good.];B[nh]
;W[ng];B[mi];W[ni];B[nj];W[oi];B[lh];W[mg];B[jk];W[kk];B[hk]
;W[hj]C[P: Looking back maybe J9 is better to separate black, my 2 white stones (L9 and L10) could have probably managed.

NM: Yes, I would have pushed first, and then come back to H10 which is good shape.. The difference in the shape is conisderable. Remember if you play K18 you're virtually alive anyway]
;B[ik];W[mk]C[P: N10 to separate seems much better now looking back!

NM: Yes, I was going to ask why you hadn't.];B[mj];W[nk]C[NM: Terrible! You're pushing him into your moyo. Should be P10.]
;B[oj];W[pj]C[P: painful...];B[ok];W[ol]C[NM: Lots of holes in W's shape here.]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[gj];W[gi];B[hi];W[ii];B[fi];W[gh];B[fj]C[P: hoorible white shape... this fight in the middle was bad for white.

NM: Yes, W is behind. But if you come out with sente the game is still worth playing - something like G8 and H6, or even Q9 to hold your territory.]
;W[jb];B[gg];W[gf];B[ff];W[gd];B[fd];W[jg];B[jf];W[if];B[je]
;W[rf]C[NM: No, far too small. As I wrote before, G8 and H6; or else Q9.]
;B[re]C[NM: Similarly, B should not reply. Playing G3, J5, or L8 would win B the game comfortably.]
;W[lb]C[NM: Again yose - there's more to play for!];B[lc];W[mb]
;B[mc];W[nb];B[ob];W[fq]C[NM: Finally! But not enough, I fear.]
;B[cl]C[NM: Too defensive. I would have played F5.];W[bh]C[NM: Too small. I would play G8 followed by G6. At that point, we would have:

B TR 18, BR 11, TL 4, BL 26: 59 with good prospects on the L and sente.

W TC 9, TL 8, B 16, R perhaps 20 + komi: 48.5 with excellent prospects at the bottom.

So B still ahead but definitely worth playing.];B[bi];W[dr]
C[P: White at C18 would have been better. to give enough space to my group.]
;B[cq];W[cr];B[gp]C[NM: Good! To have any chance now W has to push up with F4. If B can turn the E7 area into territory he will be way ahead.]
;W[gq];B[fp];W[hp];B[eq];W[er];B[jn]C[NM: I would have played L8 first, but this is OK.]
;W[km];B[lo]C[NM: Overplay. And unnecessary: Simply H5 is better.]
;W[hn]C[NM: good. This puts W back into the game.];B[jm];W[kn]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[kp];W[lp]C[NM: W should cut on the other side at K4. It gets a bit frightening, but W can resist B's L8. And K4 also reinforces the link to H6.]
;B[jp];W[kq]C[NM: No, W can't afford this move, must play something like G5, even at the cost of allowing B to push through at the bottom.
Imagine W G5, B F5, W F6, B BE6, W F7, B E8, W Q9, and we would have:

B TR 18, BR 11, TL 4, BL 30: 63 and sente.

W R 25, BC 21, BL 9, TL 10+ komi: 71.5
So quite close.];B[ho];W[io];B[go];W[ip];B[in];W[bq]C[NM: Here I would play K3 (sente), followed by Q9. But B is clearly ahead.]
;B[bp];W[jq];B[kl];W[ll];B[jl];W[mo];B[lj];W[nm];B[fh];W[hh]
;B[cb];W[bb];B[ba];W[bc];B[bg]C[P: white is dead, I neglected this group too long.

NM: I don't think so, but even with W alive here he should lose the game. B can come out with sente, reduce W somewhat on the R in sente, and then turn the N15 area into territory.. See the variation - which I don't guarantee is perfect but gives an idea.]
