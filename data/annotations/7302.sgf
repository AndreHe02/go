F3 is better as it put more pressure for the black stone.];B[qg]
;W[cn]C[Googol: Is this direction right, or should I approach from F3?

This is ok for white.

You can also approach from f3.

Please look at the 2 final variation diagrams and choose the one you prefer.

Both can be played.]
(;B[bo]TR[jp][kp][lp][mp][np][jq][kq][lq][mq][nq]C[This is a mistake by black.

You responded correctly to his move.

this move is only played when black has stones around the marked positions where white is unlikely to invade.]

This is actually ok for white after looking at the end result.

there is still a good yose move for white.]
