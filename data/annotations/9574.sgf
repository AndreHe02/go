AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[helie [6k\]: hi
KiraBox [11k\]: hello
[KB\] - I'll review things with this tag.

S. Hi, my name is Ethelor (Simon). I'm roughly a kgs 6k and I'll be reviewing your game today.

If you have any questions then dont hesitate to email me at simon@thornewill.org

Let's get started. :)];W[cf]LB[fc:A][ch:B]TR[ce]C[S.

You play triangle, next move I'll explain why this is bad.

Try to play something more simple like A or B. Against a white player who is 5 stones stronger than you, you'll want to avoid complications.]
;B[ce]LB[ci:D][di:E][cj:B][dj:A]C[S.

This is a bad move right off the start.

When you touch an opponents stone he becomes stronger, by kicking him you strengthen him. You don't attack him like this. 

If you had supporting stones around the marked area then you would be strong enough so that even if white becomes a little stronger then it won't be such a big deal.]

(;W[df];B[fd];W[dj]C[S.

Consider how now white is mostly settled. He's quite happy with himself]
;B[cn];W[qn];B[jp];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj];B[pl];W[rp];B[qo];W[ro]
;B[pn];W[qp];B[po];W[qm];B[ql]C[S.

This is alright, you've developed a little wall for yourself. I would take care not to build a moyo that is too big, Remember that you're playing against a very strong player relative to you. He will have good chances to live inside moyos that you make because he'll be better at life and death and other skills related to living in a moyo.]
;W[fq];B[eq]C[S.

This is a good kick. Well done.];W[jq]C[S.

I cannot say if this is good or not. At the very least white is playing more proactively which is nececary.]

(;B[kp];W[kq]
(;B[mp]C[[KB\] - This move felt timid, but I was worried about the push at Q7.

S.

Nevermind the push, you should hane

Jumping like this is no good. You want to press your opponent down.]
;W[mq]
(;B[nq];W[lp];B[lo]C[S.

Yes, this is a little unfortunate for black...];W[lq];B[mo]
;W[ip];B[jn]C[S.

White has gained so much just from your jump and the hane from the worse side.]
;W[fp]C[S.

This move is probably slow from white, he should play something faster after he's gained strength to work with]
;B[io]
(;W[hp];B[ck];W[ic]C[S.

I'm not sure if tenuki is the best here. But we'll see.];B[ci]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[di];B[ch];W[dh];B[bk]C[S.

This is quite a considerable loss for white, the white group is now floating.

How will he use his stone at J17?];W[fb];B[fc]
(;W[gb];B[eb];W[lc];B[bf]C[S.

You're spending far too many moves in this area. You've already gained the advantage, there are so many points left to make there, play elsewhere.]
;W[bg];B[be];W[cg]LB[rd:A][ph:C][qh:B]C[S.

I would rather play moves like this, though which is best? I do not know.]
;B[qe]
(;W[pf]C[S.

By kicking you have improved white's shape. No good.]
(;B[ld]TR[pf][qf][pj]C[S.

Why? Why lean on this group? You only make white stronger and you wont ever kill those stones after the kick.]

;B[mb];W[qa]SQ[pf][qf][pj]C[[KB\] - I should have saved this corner.

S.

Eh, not sure how to kill white. That being said, just becuase a corner is enclosed doesn't mean its certain points forever. White still has options apparently.

As I said before, these stones on the outside will pay the price for the corner. 

Was it worth it? That remans to be seen.];B[je]SQ[ld]C[S.

I think this side is already covered well with M16, no need to play this.

Although maybe not. That being said, white can settle easily now]

(;W[hd];B[he];W[ge]
(;B[hf];W[gd];B[fg];W[gf];B[gg];W[ff]
(;B[hg]C[S.

I would really love to attack that white group now, I would almost leave the cut you just fixxed and attack it right away.

Even if white cuts its not the end of the world You can sacrifice those two stones if you can keep the white ones.]

(;B[qh]C[[KB\] - I handled this invasion very poorly and helped white build a great deal of power in my moyo.

S.

Well, after the clamp you kind of panicked a bit but my point from earlier still stands...

Namely, this group is not really alive yet and he's completely surrounded. If you think hard enough you might be able to kill.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[ph]

Don't go for the 1 stone, keep white from making a base!];W[rg]

TR[ne][jf][kf][lf][mf][nf][pf][qf][jg][ng][qg][rg][nh][oh][ph]
[rh][qi][ri][fo][go][is]C[S.

So the two biggest mistakes don't happen.

You still win by 20 points so you still did pretty well all things considered.

Your biggest shortcoming is not being able to kill this group, you never saw the opportunity. Keep your eye out for things like this.

Also the mistake that happened at F5/G5, although I am not sure if its worth that much...

You completely missed out taking advantage of the K1 stone.

You also do far too many kicks in the opening when it helps your opponent.

I hope thats enough feedback for you.

Remember, email me if you have any questions.

my first instinct is to split white with the hane. His stones are quite thin.

Note that you can come back at F4 later

From here white can try a crosscut at A or a double hane at B or C. These are very complicated situations and have lots of variations.

If you are interested in this, Starstorm3 (Joshua Lee) has videos about this on youtube.

The link to his channel is below.
