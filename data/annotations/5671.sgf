C[Hello.  Thank you for reviewing my game.  Mainly, I am trying an influence based opening.  I feel I need a little more balance though.  Perhaps there were a couple of places I should have made territory.  Also, please analyze my endgame.  After he played the san-san, I think I should have lost.  Where would have been a better defense for him?

*** Hi, my name is Bernard and I'm from Hong Kong. I'm 2k on IGS with the name spadequeen. I hope my comments are useful to you =)
I'll put my comments in between '***' to distinguish them from yours.]
;B[pe];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
(;B[de]C[Right direction?

*** I believe that depends on your plan or strategy. Hard to say if this is best.
However, considering your top righthand corner stone, which is placed on the intersection of the 4th and 5th lines, clearly aims at gaining influence. Approaching from this direction may allow white to destroy the potential of moyo on the top side. (see variation F16)
I don't think this move is bad, but you may consider the alternative (previous alternative) for gaining influence if you have the chance to experiment.]

(;W[pc];B[md]C[Definitely focusing on influence.  Is it a good move in that light?

*** The Taisha. This move is nice, but it may be hard to control since this is the beginning of the most complicated josekis in go. You might also consider o16 or p17 for influence.]
;W[qe]C[*** This move is regarded as not good in this position. You could try R16.]

(;B[qf];W[qd]
(;B[fd]C[Should I have defended at q14?  I have been trying to work on timing and keeping sente.  Comments on those issues would be greatly appreciated.

*** I think you should defend the cut first. Sente is important but I believe playing honte should go first.]

(;W[cd]C[*** This move is very bad for white. Slow, and allowing black to enclose white.]

(;B[pg]C[I decided to in the end.  I just wanted another move to help the weak stone

*** Nice play here. Because of the slow move by white black is now in the lead.]
;W[nc]C[*** Again, a slow move yet a necessary honte by white. Conclusion is, R15 by white was a bad move.]
;B[mc];W[nd]
(;B[pk]C[*** There seems to be a problem with this move. First of all, since you  played N16, it seems consistent that you play O15 to connect the stones and gain influence. White can either hane at N15 or rush out with O15 when the chance is right, which would spoil black influence by a great extent.

Secondly, I think you should play a more balanced opening. Of the 9 black stones played, only 2 have been played on the 3rd line (territory line). Too concentrated on influence. And in terms of efficiency and balance, the four black stones on the line Q are not bringing out their whole utility.]
;W[jd]
(;B[jc]C[*** Since white has placed a weak stone where your black stones are stronger, you should try to gain profit by attacking it. The first thing about attack weak groups is that if you contact/ touch it directly it will help it settle by making it thick. You should attack lightly. (It does not gain any territory but can only struggle to live)]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[ic];B[je];W[jb];B[id];W[hd];B[ie];W[gc]C[*** The white group is settled easily]
;B[ne];W[oe]C[*** Terrible move by white.];B[of];W[od];B[me]
C[*** Black says 'Thank you'

No more weakness in the thickness];W[nq]C[I was happy with that outcome
I still fear the l15 ko business though.  Should I this early?

*** The ko is very small right now, nothing to be afraid of. White move here only encourages you to gain more influence/ territory in the middle.]
;B[no];W[qn]TR[no][nq]C[maybe do you know a better sequence for him?

*** White is contradicting his/herself. If white intended to play here, it would have been much better without the marked exchange. Now white can only live on either side or live on both with black gaining tremendous territory in the middle.]

(;B[pm]C[*** The shape is not good, leaves future weakness]
;W[qm];B[ql];W[rp]
(;B[qq];W[rq];B[mp]
(;W[mq]C[*** This is bad];B[lq];W[lr]C[too passive or would I have killed him?

*** White should not have tried to escape in the first place. By living, white does not get much territory, but black gained a lor on the outside. O3 was a light stone which could be utilized in other ways. Now the group is heavy and overconcentrated, and if it dies it might lead to the end of the game too.]

(;B[kq];W[kr];B[pn]C[I felt I needed this in case of w p4.  Is this right?

*** Nice move, but you needed it because the shape was not good in the first place. Imporve your shape, then less weakness and less hands used on covering up the flaws.]
;W[qr];B[pr];W[qp];B[pq];W[rr]
(;B[kk]C[Right spot?

*** There's no hurry, many other spots to exploit first. See variations (previous move).]

(;W[jj]C[*** panic =)]
(;B[kj]C[*** You're giving in without a fight here. You should fight to punish white for coming in so deep. By giving in your territory gets reduced greatly and you haven't used your moyo to attack white to the greatest extent. See variations]

At this point I think he is actually ahead.  Plus he gets another big point in later.  However, please help point out any worthy attempts at this point.  I was at quite a loss.

*** Yes I believe white is ahead. There is a proverb 'four corners kill the heart'... you shouldn't let white occupy all four, and living so big at each one.

Your attempt was okay I think, normal. You should also try to look for white weaknesses such as the bottom or try to kill the right hand corner group.

Thank you once again and I look forward to your comments.

*** You're welcome. You need to learn how to use your moyo and thickness better to attack and gain profit. And attack weak groups from a distance so you won't help settle it. Furthermore, for example in the upper lefthand corner, understand what is ajikeshi and how to wait for the correct timing for moves. Read the whole variation or at least a few moves beyond before attempting anything. I believe the upper corner variation wasn't really hard to read out beforehand.]
