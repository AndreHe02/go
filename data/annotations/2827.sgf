C[yamato [5k\]: hi
Adalberto [5k\]: hi...

This game is very reasonable for both players, with no huge mistakes. There are many areas of technique that I will mention.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[qo];W[dq];B[jq]C[
This is unusual.  Typically one would enclose the corner first at Q3 before extending along the side.

P17 is a very good point for white, since it both approaches the corner and extends from the upper left.  So black would normally play there first.

But I can't say that this move is wrong, since it invites white to come in and be attacked.  Black should be able to get  a nice wall.]
;W[oc];B[pe]
(;W[do]C[Since white ignored black's last move, black should attack the white stone in the upper right.]

(;B[qj]C[This move is a little slow.  Black's stones are a little too close for this stage of the game.]
;W[md]C[Good];B[de]C[White is still a move behind on the upper left, so black should be aiming at L17 to attack.]
;W[dh]
(;B[ec]C[Good.  The popular joseki at G16 will not work out well, since white will be able to defend the weak stones in the upper right.]
;W[eb];B[ed];W[fb];B[cc];W[cb]
(;B[bc]C[White's next move helps the upper side a lot, so perhaps you should play at D16 instead and jump to the right.]
;W[gd]
(;B[cg]C[This kind of move that forces your opponent to get stronger is usually bad.  You should try very hard to avoid it.  If you can settle your group without making this stone stronger, you will have a nice invasion behind it.]
;W[ch];B[bh];W[bi]C[Black's last two moves helped white a lot more than black.]
;B[ff];W[fh];B[hf];W[id];B[bg];W[cj]SQ[bi][ch][bh][bg][cg]C[Now the left side almost looks like territory.  If black had run out without exchanging the marked stones, it would be easy to invade the left side later.]
;B[jo];W[pq];B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[nq];B[mp]C[Good, forcing white to live and getting a wall.]

(;W[nf]C[I would add another move to the lower right before playing away.]

(;B[ph]C[This move is a little slow.  I would just enclose a big territory now.]

(;W[nh]TR[ph][jo]C[White has another chance this move to play in the corner.

For reducing the center, this is too slow.  You should try to play along or close to the line connecting the marked stones.

Somewhere around O9 feels right.];B[rq]C[Now the white stones are in great danger.]
;W[rr]C[
I think the hane at R2 will kill white, but it's not easy.]

(;B[qq]C[This is the simplest way, and is solid and good.];W[qr]
;B[mr];W[mq]
(;B[lq]C[Look at the alternative to try to kill white.  It's not easy, but white might die, and black is not risking much.]
;W[nr];B[lr]
(;W[ps]C[I think it is better to play T2 and take more points.]

(;B[nj]C[Black must play at T2 first.  It threatens the white group so it is sente, and later a white move at T3 will also be sente. The differenec in score is about 4 points.]

(;W[gq]C[It' still not too mate to reduce blacks side.];B[go]
;W[fp];B[fm];W[dm];B[kj]C[Black makes a nice potential territory here since white answered the last two moves locally.]
;W[hm]C[Nice point for white.  Since white didn't reduce earlier, he must invade.]
;B[in]
(;W[im]C[White could try a knight's move, but I don't think it is any better than this move.]
;B[jm];W[jl];B[km]
(;W[ik]C[The ladder is in your favor, so I don't think this move is needed. I would think about the cut at f6.]
;B[hn]
(;W[jf]C[The cut at f6 is still possible, and is very big.]
;B[he];W[hd];B[gl]
(;W[lk]C[Nice move.  Better to counterattack the black stone in the center than just run away.  You might think of going one point further.]
;B[kk];W[kl];B[ll];W[lm];B[ml];W[ji];B[lj]
(;W[hi]
(;B[dl]C[The upper right is also big.  This move is good since it defends a cut and reduces territory, but it ends in gote, so perhaps a move at the upper right first would be better.]
;W[cl];B[em];W[dn];B[dk]C[This move is small, and should be in the upper right.  The play at t2 is also still big.]
;W[qb]C[Big double sente endgame.  This is bigger than the previous black moves.]
;B[hr];W[hq];B[ir];W[rc];B[pc];W[pb];B[od];W[nd];B[rd];W[gr]
;B[hk];W[ij];B[lh]C[Better to play your sente moves first at T2 and G1.]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[kf];B[mg];W[ng];B[lf];W[le]C[This worked out well for black since he got points here in sente.]

(;B[oi];W[sd];B[qc];W[sb];B[re];W[se];B[sf];W[sc]
(;B[qf];W[sq]C[Black should have played here first, and had many opportunities earlier.]

(;B[ro]C[Playing S4 is several points bigger.];W[pp];B[po];W[so]
;B[sn];W[sp];B[rn];W[bb];B[gs];W[fs];B[hs];W[fr];B[be];W[iq]
;B[jr];W[dj];B[ck]C[This move is not good.  It is sente, but it's too small now. It reduces the liberties of this group, so later these three stones are captured.  You should avoid moves that fill your liberties if they can be postponed.]
;W[bk];B[fc];W[gc];B[jg];W[ej];B[me]C[This doesn't seem bigger than deending your 3 stones at d9.]

(;W[ne]C[N14 is better.  Capture a stone.];B[ke];W[mf];B[je]
;W[kd];B[if];W[el];B[jd];W[jc]
(;B[il]C[No need to throw in a stone here.  You can get the play at G7 in sente, and save a prisoner, and not have to play g10.]

Both players made some mistakes in the opening.  Black didn't attack the upper right, and strengthened white on the left side. But then white didn't reduce black's moyo enough, so the game was very close.  

White played a better endgame, picking up a lot of points in the upper and lower right side.  If black had played at T2 earlier and had played first in the upper right, he would have won.]
