C[-- 
I think the biggest problem for both black and white is that you don't pay enough attention to your weak groups. 

You should defend your weak groups before they get attacked, and conversely you should attack your opponent's weak groups before they can settle.

I hope this review will be helpful. If you have more question, don't hesitate.

Usually, white plays at A to avoid a nice black formation.]
;B[pn]C[Is Q 10 the bigger point?

I after he played there next i though i had been too concerned with protecting Q 4.

-- 
Q10 is big, but Q6 is fine.];W[qj]C[-- 
This is dangerous for white, because he can no longer make a two space extension on both sides...]

(;B[jd]LB[qg:A]C[--
This is too nice on white. If white next plays at A, he settles too easily.

Plus, the extension at A is sente for black.];W[dj];B[iq]LB[kq:A]
C[-- 
This is a bit strange : it is too far to be a pincer because white can extend at A.]
;W[pq];B[ql]LB[qq:A]C[-- 
Answering at A is better : you answer a contact move with a contact move, it puts more pressure on white and next black has some eye in the corner.

Now, if white can play at A and have a living group, with some points...]
;W[qf]LB[qg:A][qh:B]C[-- 
This is too far : there are too many black stones around, white should play at A instead. That's because now a black stone at B is painful.]

A or B are much better. This move does not attack white.];W[ol]

[dj][dp]C[-- 
Invading at san-san is not a really good idea because white can make a wall and use his san-ren-sei (the marked formation) well.
A double approach at B or C, or something else is more effective. Plus the black group at the right bottom corner isn't safe yet, and a move at A is *huge*.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[jf]LB[ed:A][fd:B]C[-- 
Too far. White should continue the joseki at A or B. Otherwise black can push white (see variation).]

Neither is very good for white (see variations)... There are much bigger areas still open right now.]

(;B[fq]LB[fq:B][lq:C][qq:A]C[-- 
It is a good idea to come back at the bottom. However, you should play at A first because the single black stone isn't really in danger, because it can expand with 2-space jump on both sides (B or C). See variation.]
;W[eq];B[ep]LB[fp:A]C[-- 
Bad move: it only helps white to get stonger. Locally, A is better.

If white can strengthen here, black won't be able to invade later the left side...]

White shouldn't have resigned. 

Even if black wins the ko, white will get something from the ko, and the game is quite close, so he doesn't need much.
