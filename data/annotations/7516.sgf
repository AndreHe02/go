C[C: Hi, I'm Charlie and I'll be reviewing this game for black. I'm around 7k in strength. I'll mark my comments with a "C" so you know it's me. Although this review is for black, I'll comment on white's moves as well, to try to give an insight into the overall flow of the game.]
;B[pc];W[pd]C[C: Strange first move from white.]
(;B[nd]C[C: This move is incorrect. The followup to the white attachment must be a hane at R16, or maybe P16 depending on your strategy. On an empty board, it is always best to hane against an attachment.]
;W[oc]C[C: It seems white is ready to fight.];B[od];W[nc]
(;B[qd]C[C: N17 is better here.];W[pe]
(;B[me]C[C: This move is bad, you must save your cutting stones first.]
;W[qc]C[C: White is happy to capture the vital stone.];B[pb]

(;W[rd]C[C: White makes a mistake here, now black can save the important stones.]

(;B[qp]C[C: Very bad! It is important to save the cutting stones.]
;W[pp];B[oq]C[C: Again, you must hane against the attachment, this move is very bad.]
;W[op]C[C: White makes a mistake as well, he should play Q3 to separate the groups.]
;B[pq]C[C: Black connects and is happy. Notice this could have resulted from Q3 before P3 without any need for a mistake from white.]
;W[nq]
(;B[nr]C[C: It is better to defend solidly at R5 and look for sente here.]
;W[no]C[C: This move is poor, white should play at N3 if he played O3 in the first place, followed by R5 at the next opportunity.]
;B[qk]C[C: Black must atari first! N3 is the vital point.];W[mr]
;B[mq];W[np];B[lr]
(;W[lp]C[C: A "thank you" move from white.];B[ms]C[C: It is not necessary to take the stone right away. You can tennuki here.]
;W[lq]C[C: This is practically a "pass" move from white.];B[cp]
C[C: Very good!];W[dp];B[dn]C[C: Again, I can't stress how important hane against attachment is.]
;W[gm]C[C: I'm not sure of the purpose behind this move from white.]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[cl];W[ck];B[dm];W[el];B[cj];W[bk];B[bl];W[dj]

(;B[bj]C[C: It is important to save the cutting stone -];W[ek]
C[C: White is happy to connect the groups.];B[ak];W[dk]C[C: A small move, better to tennuki.]
;B[dc]C[C: Probably better on the star point at D16, to maintain balance between both sides.]
;W[ec];B[ce]C[C: Hane];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[cc];W[hh]C[C: Another poor move from white.]
;B[jd]C[C: G5 is the biggest point, the corner would be enormous. Locally, N17 is better, capturing the important white stones.]
;W[ni];B[pi];W[kd];B[kc];W[ld];B[md];W[lc];B[mc];W[jc];B[kb]
;W[id];B[je];W[ke];B[if]C[C: K14 is the proper way to escape.]
;W[hc];B[kf];W[lf];B[le];W[lb];B[la];W[mb];B[nb];W[mf];B[pn]
C[C: G5 is still better.];W[pm];B[qm];W[ql];B[rl]C[C: Bad! Q8 is the only move.]
;W[ol]
(;B[rn]C[C: Why not just take the stone?];W[po];B[qo];W[on]
;B[qn]C[C: This move is unnecessary.];W[pl];B[pk]C[C: This move is too small! You must play G5 before the center gets too big.]
;W[ok];B[oi];W[pj];B[qj];W[oj];B[rk]C[C: Another unnecessary move. You are allowing white to make the big moyo in the center.]
;W[qi];B[qh];W[ri];B[rh];W[ph]
(;B[rj]C[C: You must save the vital stones! There is no need to sacrifice them.]
;W[oh];B[si];W[pi];B[sf]C[C: A "pass" move. G5 is still the biggest point.]
;W[rg]
(;B[sg]C[C: It is not necessary to defend -];W[rf];B[qg];W[pf]
;B[pg]C[C: Still better to play G5.];W[og];B[qf];W[qe];B[re]
C[C: This move is too small, G5 is there.];W[sd];B[se];W[kg]
;B[ma];W[jg];B[ig]C[C: Too slow!];W[ih];B[gf];W[hf];B[he];W[hg]
;B[fe];W[gd];B[ge];W[gg]
(;B[ef]C[C: Should be D14, but G5 is still better. It is too late to break the center, but you can still win with the big corner.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[eg];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[ei];B[ci]

;W[kq];B[jq];W[jp];B[hs]C[C: There is no need to defend here.]
;W[em];B[en];W[fn];B[cm];W[fq];B[mp]C[C: The biggest endgame point is R18.]

;B[pa];W[sb];B[rc];W[qd];B[nh];W[mj]C[C: White does not have to defend.]
;B[fb];W[cb]C[C: White makes a mistake here, should be G19.]
;B[db];W[ke];B[kd];W[kf];B[ga];W[tt];B[tt]C[C: The one thing I'm going to recommend after looking at this game is the importance of contact fighting. Forget joseki, fuseki, and development, more than anything, go is about fighting. If we all we did every game is make outlines and fill them out, go would be the most boring game in the world. The essence of go is attacking and defending, territory is just something that happens to come along on the side. In this game, especially seeing your response to the white attachments, tells me you're not very comfortable with fighting. There are some basic rules, such as hane in response to attachment, hitting the head of two stones, and the pinwheel shape that I want you to follow in every game from now on. You should be able to find basic diagrams of these shapes online as reference. One thing you might notice is that if you watch high dan players, they break these rules all the time. But that's what makes these players so good. I want you to follow these rules without exception until you hit single-digit kyu rank. After that, contact fighting is honestly so complicated that not even the pros can find the best move in every situation. But just to start out, I want you the pay attention to one thing: cutting points. Every move, before you even think about where you're going to place your stone, I want you to look at the entire board and identify the major cutting points and the important stones. By important stone, I mean stones that are keeping weak groups separated. There are many times in the game where you should've saved a very important stone, but gave it up. Likewise, you should be looking at your opponent's cutting points and important stones. I'm going to give you some controversial advice here, but I think it'll make you a better player. I want you to go into every game with the intention of killing your opponent's groups. People say go isn't about capturing stones, and they're partly right. Capturing 2-3 stones that aren't cutting is worthless. When I say capture, I mean 20+ stones at once. In the double-digit kyu ranks, your opponents will be making mistakes left and right. You should try to jump on every single one and kill off chunks of your opponents stones. Spotting mistakes is EXTREMELY important. When you hit high kyu and dan ranks, your opponents will be making much fewer mistakes and they'll be less obvious. You absolutely have to grab these opportunities, or else you'll never win more than half your games simply by making more territory.

This might seem a bit extreme, but in the long run, you'll become a better player with this kind of aggressive mentality. At the very least, your games will be more interesting! For now, I want you to focus completely on differentiating important stones from useless ones. If nothing would change if you took those stones off the board, then don't bother saving them. But, if they're performing that function, like keeping 2 groups separate, by all means SAVE THEM unless there's a very good reason you're going to sacrifice them. For now, don't worry about making overplays. If you're not sure about an aggressive move, I want you to make that move. Eventually, you'll figure out from experience what plans are feasible and which ones aren't. This is the essence of learning go, even for me. As you play more, keep sending games for review, and you'll hit single-digit kyu in no time.]
