AN[Elom Willson 7kyu]

C[Hello, I'm Elom, a kgs 7kyu. I will mark my comments with Elom:

Elom:];B[pd];W[cp];B[dd];W[pq]
(;B[jp]TR[dm][dn][qn][po][qo][ep][eq]C[Elom: This move is quite unusual, and when I checked a professional database of over 10500 games, this pattern never appears.

The reason why this move is questionable is because black will get more from approaching one of whites corners.

Corners first, sides, then center genarally applies with kakari too. 

Of course, pros do split the side, but almost exclusively when white has made an enclosure on one of the marked points. 

If black goes to the un-enclosed corner, white will pincer from the other side so there is not much difference in benefit compared to splitting.. But it's still an uncommon move.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[qi];B[rd];W[rp]LB[po:A]C[Elom: Strange, this move is usually at A.]

(;B[gp]LB[ep:A][eq:B]C[Elom: This is a fine extension, but from a global perspective still a bit cramped. Black should probably move to A instead, since it denies white a shimari at A or B, and simultaneuosly supports the k4 stone, just like this extension.

If a move is dual-purpose, consider it first, as it likely to be a good move. This move is OK, however.]
;W[dn];B[dj]C[Elom: Nice.];W[eq];B[gr]LB[jd:B][eq:A]C[Elom: This move is strange, but in this situation it's not bad and punishes the over-concentrated white move at A. 

Black can think about moves like B for faster developement too. I personally would tenuki, since the two lower side stones are light.]
;W[cl];B[ck]LB[fc:A]SQ[ae][be][ce][af][bf][cf][ag][bg][cg][ah]
[bh][ch][ai][bi][ci][aj][bj][cj]C[Elom: What this move basically says is "all of the square points are my territory. And there's nothing you can do about it"

Unfortunately, this isn't the case and white must invade that area-- you will find that you have defended nothing!

Simply move to A, the game is good enough for you!];W[ql]LB[cl:B]
[ql:C][eq:A]C[Elom: A giveaway. White should go into blacks area, since white is behind. Black has a good game, because he is more effecient with his stones and is growing faster, while white is being over conservative with A-C.]

(;B[cf]C[Elom: Now c9 looks well placed.];W[fc]
(;B[db]LB[ec:B][hc:C][cf:A]C[Elom: Black is playing solidly. Since he has the stone at A, kicking at B is okay. C is also an option.

It's questionable to make things easy for you opponent in your territory, but mabye it's just that my style is too aggressive :D]
;W[ic];B[kc]C[Elom: Good move.];W[ie]
(;B[mq]LB[fe:A]C[Elom: This move is big, but you can also take the vital point at A while making moyo.

Black has played well in the opening so far, however. These kind of calm games with no obvious urgent points are quite difficult, well, difficult for me at least :)]
;W[nr];B[mr]C[Elom: Now White takes sente.];W[fe]C[Elom: Good shape.]

(;B[eg]C[Elom:This move is too small.];W[fn];B[hh]LB[pk:A][gm:C]
[pn:B]TR[fn]C[Elom: Nicely done, this move makes A, B and C attractive moves-- takes advantage of the slow f6 which should be in the center.]
;W[of]
(;B[ke]LB[pj:C][pk:B][ol:E][gm:D][po:A]TR[fc][ic][fe][ie]C[Elom: These stones are hard to attack, so this is dame. Consider moves from A-E.]
;W[mf];B[no]C[Elom: Hmm...]
(;W[pn]C[Elom: Your lucky.];B[hn];W[fl];B[hl];W[dl]LB[nl:A]
C[Elom: !?!?!? Black must play around A next.];B[fj]TR[eh][fh]
[ei][fi]SQ[il][jl][kl][ll][ml][im][jm][km][lm][mm][in][jn][kn]
[ln][mn]C[Elom: Compare the area.];W[er];B[nm]C[Elom: Lucky again.]
;W[jg]C[Maybe it's good for black co cut here at K13 and eventually kill the white group in the upper left corner. Good Idea?

Elom: Hmm... It's very hard to kill white...]
(;B[lg]C[Elom: I think It's an overplay.]
(;W[lf]C[Elom: Another overplay.];B[kf];W[kg];B[lh];W[ji]TR[jg]
[kg][lg][lh]C[Elom: Risky for both sides.];B[if]C[Elom: A brilliant move.]

(;W[jf];B[je];W[ig];B[hf];W[hg];B[gf]TR[fc][ic][fe][ie]SQ[jf]
[hg][ig][jg][kg][ji]C[I wanted to kill w in the middle but didn't succeed.

Elom: You've practically won-- one of whites groups have to die.]

(;W[ii];B[gg]LB[ga:C][ib:B][jb:A]C[Elom: A-B-C sequence instead.]
;W[li]

;B[lk];W[nj]LB[fh:5][gh:6][gi:4][hj:2][nj:8][gk:3][jk:1][lk:7]
C[Elom: 1 to 8 is out of touch. White will live or die in the upper left depending on who plays first.]
;B[fb]C[Elom: Finally, now black should surely win.];W[gb];B[eb]
;W[id];B[nk]LB[jb:A]C[Elom: Why tenuki? Play A to kill white and make certain your win.

When you're ahead, you must play solidly like you did in the opening, without taking risks.]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[jd];B[le]
(;W[lc]C[Elom: Big mistake.]
(;B[mc]LB[lb:A]C[Elom: Even bigger mistake. You MUST strike down your stone at A.]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[kb];B[md];W[ge]C[Elom: Now the game is better for white.

It's time for the late endgame.];B[ee];W[ff];B[fg];W[ef];B[df]

[hs][is][js][ks][ls]C[Elom: White wins by 14.5 moku.

You played solidly in the beginning game, and the joban (opening), turned out to be promising for you.

When you started complications at 45, white had a chance to come-back, but missed it with 46. 51 was a perfect way to cut white, and you had almost sealed the game before an unnecessary tenuki. 

Both players made crucial reading errors before white finally came out on top, living on the top side, and by then the game was irreversible.

It's hard to deduct your weak and strong points, because the game was so calm, but it clear that you have a good grasp of calm, territorial play in the opening, but maybe not so good at fighting.

I'd suggest studying speed and efficiency in the fuseki, and also train your Life&Death skills with-- well-- life and death problems.

Good game, I hope this review helps a little :) if you have any questions, doubts or disagreements, just send me an email.
