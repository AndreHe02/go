C[J: Hi, my name is Jay and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments begin with "J:"]
PL[B];B[pd]C[My first game in the Norwegian championship 2013. I am black.]
;W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq];W[qf];B[qi]LB[nc:A]TR[ph][qh][pi]C[A dan player had suggested this exact opening for me a few months earlier, so everything should be fine so far.

J: Correct, though falling back at A is more peaceful.  Other pincers are possible too.]
;W[nd];B[pf]
(;W[pg];B[of];W[kd]TR[of][pg]C[J: making the Q13 -> P14 trade then followed by L16 is odd to me.  The focus here should still be the corner.  Black can take a large corner and make white overconcentrated with P17 later.  See Variations.

J: White should instead jumped into the corner earlier.]
(;B[qe]C[J: the honte move.];W[jp];B[cj]TR[cf][cn]C[White is looking big and I wonder if I already have made a mistake in letting him have it easy. Or maybe C6 or C14 is better here?

J: White looks big but you can't say he has any territory yet.  Any of these are possible.]
;W[cg];B[cm];W[co]
(;B[fd]LB[cc:A][dc:B][id:C][lp:E][fq:D]C[J: F16 is a very mild reduction, that can come under attack easily.  Some other ideas are:  invade directly at A, reduce the side at B, attack the top two stones with C, split the bottom with D, or increase the right with E.  See variation.]
;W[ec];B[fc];W[ic]C[J: black has no base now.];B[de];W[ce]
(;B[df]C[J: Black missed an opportunity at C17, See Variation.]
;W[cf];B[ed];W[dc];B[eh]C[I looked at the game briefly with the program Crazy Stone and it suggested 29 H17...?

J: Since white has a solid corner, it's difficult to accomplish much locally now.]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[ef];B[ff]C[This sacrifice is probably wrong but I thought it looked safer for the F17 group.]
;W[ee]C[White is ahead according to CrazyStone.];B[fe];W[fp]
TR[fc][fd][fe][ff]C[J: black's wall feels useless.];B[eq]C[Maybe too desperate.

J: It's ok as a probe.  It's actually difficult for white to keep the whole bottom.]
;W[dq]
(;B[fq]C[J: black should keep play here light, or else the stones become a liability when they're worth too much to sacrifice.  See variation.]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[hq];B[hp]C[J: this cut just doesn't work.];W[iq]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[io]C[This is not too promising for black. Maybe F5-G5-F6-H5?-N15 instead. (Based on CrazyStone)

J: black looks dead on the bottom.];W[fo];B[jo];W[ko]C[J: L5 is an overplay.  Just staying strong with L4 is enough;  making sure white has more liberties than G3 group.]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[lp];W[kn];B[ip];W[jq];B[jm];W[jn]TR[lq]C[J: white should push once more to gain more liberties to fight G3.]
;B[in];W[im];B[hm];W[il];B[hn];W[kl];B[hl]C[J: black is adding stones to a weak group, and pushing white from behind.]
;W[ik];B[lq];W[el]TR[gr]C[J: white must capture with G2 now.  black has to spend a move to link up H8.]
;B[em];W[ek]C[This looks a bit strange. White should perhaps play F7 instead, but appears to be ahead still.]
;B[fm];W[gj]LB[gr:A][hr:B]C[Maybe D11 instead. (Based on CrazyStone)


J: all this fighting doesn't matter if we see that white can play at A, or black can play at B to kill the other.]
;B[hk];W[hj];B[fk];W[fj]C[J: When black pushs white like this, white's outside gets stronger.]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[dj];W[di]C[Comfortable white lead.];B[hr];W[if]
C[J: white has the lead but black has a sente move to try to secure the right side.]
;B[ij];W[hh];B[ii]
(;W[dh]C[P13 instead? (Based on CrazyStone)

J: P13 is trying to attack J11.  White doesn't actually have to answer here, but it's safe if you can't read it out.  See Variation.]
;B[lm]C[J: white may not answer this peep. See variation.]
(;W[km];B[jk];W[li]C[This is strange to me. White convinced himself that K8 is bad and played this instead. According to CrazyStone, black is now back in the game.]
;B[jl]C[J: white gets tricked.];W[lk];B[kg];W[mg];B[mf];W[lf]
;B[lg];W[nf];B[mh];W[ng];B[nh];W[og];B[lh]C[White appears to be ahead again. Maybe P11 instead. (Based on CrazyStone)

JL: black looks to be ahead now since the whole right bottom quadrant of the board is almost blacks.]
;W[pc]C[White Q11 instead? (Based on CrazyStone)];B[qg];W[rf]
;B[rg];W[re];B[rd];W[oe];B[pe];W[od];B[qd];W[oj];B[ph];W[nn]
;B[pl]C[Almost even now according to CrazyStone. At this point I quit taking notes but after I unsuccessfully tried to get something on top, I miraculously killed the entire SouthWest corner!  My opponent lost on time, but I seemed to have a narrow win anyway.

J: It seems that both players missed some opportunities. Black should focus on figuring out which are the important stones.  During the middle game, important stones are ones that are worth lots of points (usually > 30), are cutting stones, connecting stones, or stones keeping a group alive.  All others are unimportant and maybe sacrificed if there are bigger/urgent moves elsewhere.

J: thanks for showing me this game.])
