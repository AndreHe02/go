AB[dp][pd]C[BritishSai [3k\]: hi

hi reviewer, played this game on 19th october. i'm white in this game. would like you to please focus on the following things:

1) fuseki/direction of play
2) lower right - can i kill outright or do something nice here? i read it for a while...
3) top right - i don't think my result here was ideal - any advice?
4) specifically my move M10. how do i reply when he plays the cross-cut instead of backing off? this scared me. i presume my cap to protect my area is fine but the cross-cut looks nasty to deal with.

thank you, i appreciate it. if you have any general comments too, feel free to add those in.]
;W[pp]C[wurfmaul [5k\]: hi];B[dd];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj]C[This move is not bad, but in a handicap game I would prefer to play faster and create the miai shape at F3.]
;B[cf]C[This move is a bit too conservative from black, K3 is the important point.]
;W[db]C[It is not necessary to invade so soon, bottom side still the most important.]

;W[jd];B[iq];W[nb]C[It is better to move out into the center than live small on the side. You have to consider the outline black is creating on the left.]

;B[hd];W[lb];B[na];W[ck]C[I would consider playing the important point at K15 first. C3 is still available for reduction, so a direct invasion is not urgent yet.]

;B[kr];W[mq];B[ii];W[ki];B[kj];W[lj]C[You specifically asked about this move. In this case, it is possible to cross cut, you ahve strong groups on both top and bottom and it is possible to start the fight, it is not clear how black can survive. That said, this move is not very bad, the points are close, although of course sente is nice.]

;B[ls]C[Black is obviously concerned about his stones, but this is actually not an important group. He can easily save them in sente with S4 anyway.]

[rm][rn][si][sj][sk][sl][sm][sn]C[To recap your main questions -

1. It seems your fuseki got thrown off a bit by the partial enclosure at the top left. Remember that the knight's enclosure is much better with 3-4 than the star point. Even if black spends one more move to make the full enclosure, it's not a big issue, the bottom side was more important here and you had 2 chances to take it.

2. I don't think there's a clear killing chance here, the result you did get was pretty good, you took advantage of black's eagerness to save a not-so-important group.

3. Your result in the top right was not ideal, you're right here. The main issue was that you were too eager to secure your group on the side. In this situation, it would be better to show some fight and go out into the center. This has the dual effect of securing your group and reducing black on the left.

4. Cross-cutting or not I think is a matter of preference. It's not wrong to play conservatively, and if you thought you're ahead in the endgame there's nothing wrong with the cap. The main issue with the move is sente, I would lean towards the cross-cut because of this, although to be honest I would probably cap as well just out of laziness :)]
