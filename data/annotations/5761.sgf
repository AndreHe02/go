C[Thx for reviewing. I lost this one for 15 pts. but enjoyed playing. I will make a couple of questions on certain moves.

Hi Zappastian,

I'll try to give it the best review I can.

-Dave];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[cg];B[fe]C[************
I am not too familiar with this Joseki, but looking it up, it seems that F15 is not really played. B15 is common, and I think I've seen c17.

The reason this is bad is that white can connect underneath. See variation. This is a fairly common pattern throughout the game, and is worth learning. It is the reason that generally invasions at this point in this extension are bad.

See http://senseis.xmp.net/?34PointHighApproachOneSpaceLowPincer#1 for a more thorough discussion.]

(;W[dj]C[***************
White here fails to connect, which is a mistake. Generally white needs to keep the pressure up after pincering tight like this.]
;B[qj];W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[kp]C[**************
This move needs to be at L3. When Black comes in, there is too much room for him to live comfortably beneathe this stone.]

(;B[gp]C[On this move i wanted to invade before white mede a similar move. Assuming the the idea was right: is this a good place? What to consider when chosing this invasion points?

***************************
The move is probably in the right direction, but it does not exploit the weakness of the high L4 stone. I would favor J3 or H3 instead. See variations.]
;W[hq]C[White needs to back off at J3. "Don't touch what you are attecking".]
;B[eq];W[dq]C[************
Again white touches. C3. Touching what you attack makes it stronger.]
;B[do]
(;W[cn]C[*******************
Black is trying for light sabaki play here, but white will cut him apart if he is not careful. See variation.]
;B[em];W[dl]C[********************

Black's moves here are simply allowing white to secure his territory. The black stones are still weak. 

When you play light sabaki play you try to live quickly or escape to the center without helping your opponent strengthen surrounding positions. It is hard!]
;B[hn];W[qe]C[This invasion is poorly timed and in the wrong place  - White should attack the weak black group.  White could also help the weak D17 stone at F17 or connect underneath as previously discussed.]
;B[qd]C[This is the correct response.];W[qh];B[of];W[rd];B[rc]

C[************
White's timing here is very good. he will not benefit much more on tope, so switching to this is a good idea.

Black's plan to make a center territory is OK, but its too little to catch up at this point. White is far ahead - Black needs to do something drastic. Letting white in from the left was bad.]

****************************
Zappastian,

A couple of things made you loose this game.

1) You fell behind badly when you tried to do light sabaki on the bottom left. White secured the left side and bottom, the majority of his territory.

2) You missed a chance to attack the top right group and drive it toward your thickness. You might have been able to create a really good attack on this group, possibly killing it, or gaining a larger central territory.

3) There were a few pretty big endgame moves, specifically at the bottom and breaking in on the left hand side. White's clever endgame capture of 3 stones in the top left was easy to overlook, but was costly. Perhaps you were not looking carefully because you felt you had lost already.

I hope you find these comments helpful. Good luck with your game.
