C[M:  Hi, Capsaicin.  I'll preface all of my comments with "M".

M:  First, a couple of slaps on the wrist.
1.  Please comment your games.  It makes them much more interesting to review.  
2.  Please submit games in which you lost and don't know why or about which you have specific questions.  This game is just a large L&D test in which black made the last mistake.  

M:  The opening was odd and moved straight into close combat.  In general, I suggest that you worry more about defense and moving your groups into the center.  Black got strong attacks on the white groups several times because you failed to do so.  

M:  You responded locally far too often.  After every move, stop and ask, "Do I need to respond?"]
;B[om]C[M:  Odd.  When I see something like this, I expect black to play a very aggressive, fighting oriented game.  Black wants to force you into a life&death mistake.  So...play slow, think through your moves.  Be solid.]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[cc];B[dc];W[ce];B[bd];W[bc];B[de];W[ed];B[be]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[cg]C[M:  Good.  Note that the ladder doesn't work here, so the reason this is good is because you are pushing black along the second line.]
;B[db]
(;W[bb]C[M:  Keep the pressure on D18.  Play C18 (as the variation).]
;B[bg];W[ec];B[ee];W[eb];B[ch];W[dg];B[dh];W[eg];B[fe];W[eh]
;B[gd];W[jc]C[M:  I think this move is a little out of focus. Your corner is safe.  The top is not worth much because black's group is so weak.  Instead, strengthen your E12 group or take a corner.]
;B[id];W[mc];B[oc];W[hb];B[gg];W[ej];B[ic];W[ib];B[jd];W[kc]
;B[ck];W[cj]LB[hi:A][el:B]C[M:  Just keep jumping out.  Black is not in danger here.]

(;B[bi]C[M:  See the variation to see why black protected the cut.  The summary:  black wants to play D11 and cut your groups apart.

M:  Since keeping your groups connected will make your stones heavy, C10 looks like a mistake.  Instead, white should have jumped out.]
;W[bj];B[di];W[dj]C[M:  Now you have two heavy groups.  Black has succeeded in making you make a fighting mistake.]
;B[ei];W[fh];B[fi];W[gh];B[fj];W[el];B[ek]C[M:  Black is doing you a favor here.  If he just forces this group to run, your other group will become weaker.]
;W[dk];B[fk];W[cl];B[cm];W[dm];B[cn];W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[co]
;W[cq];B[dn];W[en];B[bq]C[M:  I would have played to protect the weakness at D5.  Maybe D3?  Black can't ignore this.  As it is, you got into a position where black could get seki and great thickness.]
;W[cr];B[eo];W[ep];B[fo];W[br];B[bl];W[bk];B[fn];W[em];B[bm]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[aq]
(;B[al]C[M:  See var.];W[an];B[fl];W[ak];B[fm];W[dl];B[oe];W[pp]
LB[lf:A]C[M:  Good for you!  The top corner is still open, so you might as well leave it be.  If I were to play in the corner, I probably would have played 3-4 here.  The 4-4 stone's influence is not very useful in this position.  

M:  That being said, G12 is looking very, very sad right now.  It's worth playing a few moves to lessen the damage if it is lost.  How about M14 (A)?  This threatens to encircle black's stones and opens up the moyo black is creating.]
;B[qn];W[mq];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[dq]
(;B[kq]LB[le:A]C[M:  If black had played at M15 (A, see  var), white would be at a disadvantage.  The bottom is not worth much to either side.]
;W[lo]C[M:  Remember that the knight's move is easily cut with support nearby.  In this case, cutting is exactly what black wants to do.]
