C[Pierredego: This was nicely played. Your shapes were much better than your opponent's. You must remember to attack at a distance and keep an eye on the urgent points, first, and the big points, second. I comment on some of the the missed opportunities that I saw. Continue enjoying this great game.]

(;W[qd]C[Avoid contact moves while attacking. The diagonal move is considered a contact move. It will make the Q17 stone stronger. R15 would be better.]

;B[kn]
(;W[id]C[I think around this time I was thinking about sacrificing the bottom and trying to maintain the right and top.  Should I have played it out differently before this, or should I be thinking about it differently around here?

Pierredego : There seems to be no need to sacrifice the lower side. The aji of O6 enables you to run out. However you might want to play M16 first. Then, if black closes the lower side with M6 you might still be able to resist there... (See variation)]
