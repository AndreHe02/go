C[buckyyowza:  Comments by Mark Fyffe, with closing comments on the last frame.  I hope you enjoy this review, and find that it helps you to improve your game!]

(;B[lc]LB[qc:B][ne:A]C[buckyyowza: See variations - This pincer is questionable for black.  With R17, white can settle easily in the corner, but first with O15 can trap black's M17 stone against white influence on the left side.  Since black will need to respond in order to take some benefit from M17, white will be able to settle the corner in sente.

Instead of M16, black should respond to Q18 with R17, then tenuki after white follows up in gote.]

(;W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[mc]C[buckyyowza: This play is too close, and helps white connect while trapping black somewhat desparately against the side.  Do not be so eager to fight - a fight will always come :)  In the opening, focus on strengthening your stones against the attack and minimizing your oppontent's range of influence.  Until later in the game following a well read out sequence, avoid touching/forcing plays like this when your group is not yet settled.  In this position, I prefer K17 - threatening to extend along the upper side or into the center while building influence for a left side invasion.]
;W[md]
(;B[nd];W[kc];B[kb];W[jc];B[jb];W[ic];B[nb];W[oc];B[ob]C[buckyyowza: It is much better for black to continue at J18 to make life here.  Clearly, black cannot fail to live with the M17 group, but pushing in this direction forces white into the corner and significantly weakens black's upper right.  White similarly cannot fail to live in the upper right, but can easily do so in sente after this play.  However, black still needs one more stone to live: not considering Q17 aji, white can kill with J18]

(;W[pc];B[od];W[qd];B[qe];W[pa]C[buckyyowza: white's play is suicide. black should take advantage :)  Yes, atari at R17 is best here.]

(;B[mb];W[rd]
(;B[la]C[I made an eye so J18 wouldnt be sente

buckyyowza: J18 is also sente for black, and ensures life for this group.  Since the left side is still open for invasion, black can only gain by creeping along the upper side in sente.]
;W[jf];B[cf];W[cc];B[dj]C[buckyyowza: I prefer D11.  This jump is too easy to cut given white thickness in this area.]

(;W[dr];B[ef];W[hq];B[gp]C[buckyyowza: I prefer F4.  The one-space jump makes use of the D10 stone white limiting white thickness from the lower left as well as putting pressure on H3.  This shoulder hit will force white into a successful dragon through black's moyo.]
;W[io];B[hp];W[ip];B[iq];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr];B[hr];W[lp];B[mq]
;W[mp];B[np];W[no];B[oo]LB[op:A]C[buckyyowza: Black is made thin by this double-hane and left in gote anyway due to the need to protect P4 or O3.  Simply P4 is enough to ensure a solid position for black in the area and keep influence on the right side.]
;W[nn];B[op];W[kq];B[fd];W[on];B[eb]C[buckyyowza: white should not ignore black's kikashi play at F16.  However, black should not sacrifice the right side in order follow up right away.  With this line, it seems both players are playing a different game, but black will suffer more through the loss of the right side if the upper left is not played out in sente.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[db];B[ec];W[ee];B[fe];W[bd];B[bf];W[ed];B[qn]
C[buckyyowza: should be at R7.  If white can invade and live on the right, then the pressure on black's Q14 group becomes quite problematic.]
;W[qm];B[pn];W[pm];B[qi];W[bk];B[cl]LB[fg:A]SQ[ng][fj]C[Not sure if this pressing down was right since theres nothing to build in the centre yet.

buckyyowza: white's play here feels slow and unimaginative.  I expect the aim is to erase black's side territory around the D10 stone, but that is endgame play.  The 2nd line is often called the line of retreat. More interesting for both players is the cut at F14.  As black I would prefer to follow up at F13 now to both strengthen the side group and reinforce the cut.  You might notice how white's center influence is becoming well formed (imagine a white stone at O13 and another at F10) while black's groups still lack shape and can only live small on the side for now.  F13 would be a big step in the right direction for black now.]

(;W[bl];B[bj]LB[fg:C][ci:B][cj:A][om:D]SQ[bl]C[Another unsure move

buckyyowza: Black's left side was reduced already by B8, and continuing that line of play is premature yose.  Locally, C11 or C10 first will stop the approach, but there are larger plays on the board and at best this area is gote for black. The best move for black locally is F13.   Note also that a ladder at P7 works for black, particularly if the F14 cut is defended, so a few well-placed stones in white's center will threaten a potentially large cut there.]

(;W[nl];B[rb]C[I thought I could make a ko or seki out of this carpenter's square move. I didn't. How do I play it right?

buckyyowza: S15 is a vital liberty in this position, so white will live after S18.  If black plays S15 and white doesn't respond, then black can kill with S18.]

;W[ln];B[lf];W[ke];B[hl];W[ib];B[ie];W[id];B[hn]LB[ig:A][nj:B]
C[buckyyowza: Notice that a white stone at F14 is still disaster for black.  The H6 play is not entirely necessary other than to help the G4 group ensure a second eye or connect out.  Larger center plays are J13 and O10 at this time.]

(;W[kf];B[hg]C[buckyyowza: I like this play :)  Here is where black takes control of the game. The F14 cut is now protected, and white will soon need to conceive of a second eye.]
;W[if];B[hf];W[he];B[ge];W[hd];B[dn];W[do];B[en];W[ff]
(;B[df]C[buckyyowza: E13 may be a safer choice.  Black can threaten 1/2 point on white's corner after D14, but white's F14 aji is more dangerous this way.]
;W[gf];B[fg];W[fc]C[buckyyowza: here is why black should have played E13 instead of D14]
;B[gg];W[gc];B[jh];W[pj];B[qj];W[pi];B[rl]C[Unsure move since if hurts my bottom right if I didnt defend it later.

buckyyowza: I prefer S7.  The right side group will live either way, but there are more points for black to protect in the lower right.]
;W[rm];B[pk]C[buckyyowza: must be S6 - black will lose up to 8 points in the corner otherwise.]
;W[ok];B[ph]LB[nh:B][mk:A]C[buckyyowza: too thin for black.  It would have been better instead of Q9 and Q12 to reduce white's center potential and build moyo for black from the other side - N9 or O12 for example.

Play is already starting to wind down; the rest of the game is played through straightforward yose sequences, and some mistakes by white, so this is the last comment I will make.  Closing comments are on the final frame.]

[ss]C[buckyyowza: Thanks for the opportunity to review this game!  In all this is an exciting game and not a bad result for black.  As you can see from the final position, black's briliiant move to H13 at #99 was largely responsible for this win.

For both players, it seems the importance of attaining a strong, settled, position before launching the attack is not taken seriously.  Though white seems to understand this a little better, he also failed to read some important situations well enough, and so gave black several points through careless play.  Your first task in the opening, after staking out an initial claim on the board, is to settle your most influential stones so they may be effective in battle.  Striking out too soon or defening against an invasion too aggressively leads easily to losing the fight and scrambling to make life.  I'd suggest studying joseki and reading the opening of some professional games to gain insight on how to settle in sente early in the game.

Points in the game where black plays too aggressively and comes out worse off are the pincer at #11, and the sequence that follows; #55 and #61 also demonstrate an eagerness to fight without clear goals or a plan of attack.  It can often be better to stay strong and wait for your opponent to strike first.

I hope you have enjoyed my comments and find them to be of use!

buckyyowza: I still prefer K17.  Black is not yet prepared for battle. L17 is a cutting point after N16, and needs to be protected.  That said, I think the cut at O16 gives white more trouble than playing under at O18.]
