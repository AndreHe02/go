C[Tony:  Hi.  This review is by Tony Chamberlain  -- 6k on KGS.
jusifast [9k\]: bonjour bonne partie];B[qd];W[dp]C[Dlayn [9k\]: hello]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[fq]
(;W[po]LB[od:a]TR[dc]C[Tony:  Tenuki here is not bad,  but Q5 is not best.
Tony:  a  is the same approach and works much better with the marked stone.
Tony:  also see alternate node to answer 5 without tenuki];B[op]
LB[pl:a][ql:b][oo:c]C[Tony:  Black 7 is usually not played with a stone at a or b,    White should play at c for standard joseki.]
BM[1];W[qq];B[oo];W[qp]LB[pn:a]C[Tony:  This move seems small.  White should play at a, before black does.]
;B[pn]C[Tony:  which black does. keeping white out of the middle.]
;W[jp]TR[fq]LB[qn:a][fp:b][od:c][ce:d]C[Tony:  This move is too aggressive.   Its good to reduce black's territory,  but this is dangerous  in between a small black wall, and the marked stone.
Tony:  Much more important now is A.. to keep access to the side.
Tony:  If not that, Then Tenuki at B, C, or D is much better for territory,  or reducing black.]
;B[iq];W[eq]TR[jp]LB[cq:a][fp:b]C[Tony:  Too small and doesn't stop the invastion at A
Tony:  B is mch better move at attempts to help the marked stone.
Tony:  With B you might build a wall and force black on the inside.]
;B[fo];W[fp];B[gp];W[ep];B[gq]
(;W[go]LB[cn:a]TR[jp]C[Tony:  Again too aggressive.  White has a solid corner but needs to protect the top and expand into the middle.   Give up the marked stone for now.  It might be used as aji later.
Tony:  White needs to play A now before black can block him out.   Look at node to visually see how much nicer the board looks with stone at A :)]
;B[fn]
(;W[ho]TR[jp]C[Tony:  all the moves until Black 41 is white chasing after bad stones, and giving black free moves.  Try to avoid fights like this early and develop more.   If you really want to keep the marked stone try a lighter move in the variation.]
;B[lq];W[jq];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir];W[kq];B[lp];W[jn];B[io];W[ip]
;B[in];W[jo];B[hp];W[im];B[hn];W[hm];B[gn];W[jl];B[cn]C[Tony:  Very big move for Black.   White can't go into the left side now, and his corner is threatened.]
;W[bp];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[er]LB[qn:a][od:b][ce:c]C[Tony:  46 is too small,   Black's group can escape to the center if you take his bottom eye away.
Tony:  A, B and C  are still very big moves.];B[bo]C[Tony:   46]
;W[bq];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn]
(;W[pp]LB[po:a][rn:b]C[Tony:  Give up the Stone at A.  instead play at B.  See variation]
;B[pr];W[qr];B[rn];W[nr];B[nq];W[or];B[oq];W[ps];B[mr];W[sp]
;B[rq];W[rr];B[os];W[qs];B[km];W[jm];B[ln];W[kd]LB[od:a][ce:b]
C[Tony:  Good that your moving in the top.. But A, and B still better then 70]
;B[dj];W[oc]C[Tony:  Good approach.. works well with previous stone.  Black should have played 72 first.]
;B[od];W[nd];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc]C[Tony:  Good approach..];W[nm]
LB[ce:a][pi:b]C[Tony:  Another attack this is far too aggressive and deep in black's territory.  Your just going to have to run and fight.
Tony:  A for territory.. or B to limit black's right side is much better.]
;B[om];W[pi]C[Tony:  There you go.  Good spot and high enough to run if need be.]
;B[nh]
(;W[ql]LB[qf:a]C[Tony:  This is certainly playable.. though I think the knight's move attacking top might be more effective.
Tony:  A is the standard move for black to protect the cut, and he failed to play it.  See variation.]
;B[pl];W[qk];B[pk];W[qf]C[Tony:  Black lets you take the spot anyway!]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[qj];W[pj];B[rj];W[og];B[oh];W[pg];B[qi];W[rh]
;B[rk];W[rl]TR[qk][ql]LB[pd:a]C[Tony: The marked stones are dead. they have less liberties.  They lose the fight by 1.  Better to make the cut at A]
;B[sl];W[ne];B[ng];W[pd]C[Tony:  Good.  The cut is big!];B[nf]
;W[of];B[kf]TR[qc][qd]C[Tony:  the marked stones are in grave danger of dying.  Black Tenuki at 105 is very risky.]
;W[kh]LB[qb:a]C[Tony:  You should punish him be taking his corner at A]
;B[if];W[id];B[de]
(;W[fd]C[Tony 110 seems unnecessary.  I would protect the corner with the standard attachment joseki.. see variation]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[ed];W[ec];B[ff];W[ih];B[kl];W[jj]TR[ih][kh]LB[kj:a]
[fk:b]C[Tony:  118 does give you a firmer connection to the marked stones, but A seems to give a better room for eyes,
Tony:  Though i think placing a stone around B  is best.  Gives Room for eyes and threatens blacks left side.]
;B[hk]LB[fk:a][gk:b]C[Tony:  Black stops us from expanding at a Good move.. though it might be too deep,  B seems better for black]
;W[fj]LB[gk:a]C[Tony:  a little too deep.  the attachment at A seems safer.]
;B[hi]C[Tony:  A little too deep.];W[hh];B[gi];W[gh];B[fi];W[hf]
;B[gd];W[hd];B[ge];W[gf];B[fe];W[he];B[fc];W[bd]LB[jp:a]C[Tony:  good job connecting to the top.  Though this is why that original stone at A was bad.  It caused us to run the whole game and we lost territory up top saving it.]
;B[jf];W[mf]MA[bf][cf][cg][ch][ci][bh][bi]LB[bg:a][qb:b]C[Tony:  Again too small.   A good rule of thumb before you play is find the biggest open spot on the board and look to play there.
Tony:  If you have a strong strategic reason to ignore this, then do that.  But 136 doesn't really need to be played.
Tony:  A seems like a good jump into black's left side.  Or B is still open to kill the corner]
;B[lg];W[mg];B[mh];W[lh];B[me];W[lf];B[le]C[jusifast [9k\]: stupid
Dlayn [9k\]: happens allll the time to me...];W[pe]C[Tony:  No need to take these.  They can't possibly be saved in one move.   This move just gives black sente.]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[kc];W[jc]C[Tony:  Good defense.  Black gets too aggressive here.]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[ib];B[jk];W[ik];B[kk];W[ij];B[ii];W[ji]
;B[gl];W[be]C[Tony:  good idea.. but too passive.   A 1 point jump is just as safe.]
;B[cg];W[gm];B[fm];W[bg];B[bh];W[cf];B[dg];W[ch];B[bi];W[fg]
;B[eg];W[fl];B[ej];W[gk];B[hj];W[hl];B[el];W[fh]LB[qb:a]C[Tony: these moves are all good sente moves for the end game.  But A is still bigger :)]

;B[oa]
(;W[na]TR[sg][re][rf][rg]C[Tony:  You can ignore that move.. black can't run or make eyes with that move.   You can still kill the marked stones, and let the smaller corner live.  See variation]
;B[rc];W[sd];B[sb];W[sa];B[se];W[pa];B[sb];W[ha];B[oa]C[jusifast [9k\]: lose  the game for sure]

[ak][al][am][qk][ql][bl][bm][go][ho][lo][mo][no][mp][mq]C[Tony:  I think you used sente well, especially in the late game.   However, you need to work on making less aggressive and dangerous plays,  especially in the beginning.  Try to reduce black territory by spreading from your own, rather than try to attack and take away everything black has.
Tony:   Also,  before every move.. check the whole board for the biggest spot left.   Many of the best moves were left unplayed for many turns.]
