KM[0.500000];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp]C[DS: This opening is just fine, but by playing opposite corners B is looking for a complicated fighting game, rather than one that uses the moyo/influence strategy.]
;W[qp]
(;B[cq]C[DS: No, this is wrong timing.  At early stage of the game you need to work on global board position.  This move is purely territorial and is too "slow".  If white invades early, it would only be good for black. See my variation for a better strategy.]
;W[de];B[dj]C[DS: Better would be to make a kakari in the other corner.  Same as in my first variation.]
;W[jd]C[DS: Same comment, better for W to take the other corner with P4.]

(;B[md]C[DS: A better move might be N17 as it undercuts W and protects the corner better.  See variation.]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[qf];B[qe];W[qi]C[DS: Standard move is W Q14, but is difficult here.  W at R14 was not the best and the result is better for black.]
;B[oq];W[pq]
(;B[lq]C[DS usual play is to play a direct extension move against a direct contact move by W.  ie B may do better at P4.  See my variations.]
;W[pl];B[oo];W[po]
(;B[nm]C[DS: I think B can do well by first playing P6, before a jump like this.  It would build great thickness for B that works great with the left side stones.  See variation.]
;W[on];B[no];W[om]C[DS: Maybe W should have kept pusing through at O6 first.]
;B[nl];W[dl]C[DS: white invades deeply, but may pull it off as B's D10 string is weak.]
;B[fj]C[DS: Consider playing a capping move at F8.  This works well with B's Right side wall and puts more pressure on W D8.  Alternately E7 or E9 with a shoulder hit could lead to quite a fight for white for life.]
;W[fl];B[hj]C[DS: a move by B at C6 would damage W's base for eye space.]
;W[cn]C[DS: so W takes the key point here.];B[ck];W[cl];B[co]C[DS remember the proverb: Don't touch what you are attacking.  ie, contact plays only help to strengthen your opponent's stones.]
;W[bn];B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[bo];B[bp]C[DS: so far B is doing ok.  Good job so far with shape moves, and no empty triangles for B, one for W.]
;W[bk];B[bj];W[dk];B[cj]C[DS:  Bad shape here.  As there are really few ko threats, white shouldn't try and start a ko battle at this stage yet.]
;W[ak];B[aj];W[bm];B[ao]C[DS: White is alive now, this doesn't threaten W at all.  Better now to play elsewhere.  Perhaps play at G7.]
;W[hl];B[gn];W[im];B[io];W[ik];B[ij];W[jj];B[gd]C[DS: This may be ok.  It acts like an invasion and a pincer attack.  Another possibilty would be to play E16 as a peep before hand though.]
;W[if];B[gf];W[jh];B[hh];W[ei];B[ej];W[eh]
(;B[gj]C[DS: This is too slow and has no shape to it.  better to play G9 first, which provides connection but also peeps at G8.  See variation.]
;W[bh];B[ic];W[fc];B[jc];W[gc];B[hd]C[DS: This is ok as it links you up to the stones on the right.  B's big dragon could be in trouble if W can cut it off from the stones above.

DS: At this point I would estimate that B has a small  lead. But it is still undecided.]
;W[id];B[hc];W[ih]C[DS: remember, it is important almost always to respond locally to a contact play.  I think I would have played at G12 instead of B's next move at L16.]
;B[kd];W[gh]C[DS: I would have to say that B's move at L16 was probably the losing move.]
;B[hg];W[gg];B[hi];W[hf]C[DS: Now Black's big dragon is in trouble and without eyespace.]
;B[ig];W[jg];B[je];W[jf];B[ie];W[ff];B[ge];W[fe];B[pf];W[qg];B[pg];W[ph]
C[DS: These moves by B only help W form his wall on the R securing territory. They do nothing to help B.]

;B[mg];W[mm];B[ml];W[lm];B[nj];W[lk];B[oj]C[DS: B's stones here are dead. This move is of no use.]
;W[pi];B[kn]C[DS: This peep has little value.  Even if W ignores it, and B plays M7, W just connects at M8.]
;W[ln];B[mo];W[km]C[DS: W should have kept pushing down first at M5.];B
[lo];W[pj];B[rf];W[rg]
(;B[se]C[DS: This hanging connection is ok, but the standard responce is to solidly connect.  This will give white sente later. See variation.]

;W[gk];B[em];W[el];B[hk]C[DS: B trys to link-up his dragon but is too late for that now.]
;W[il];B[fk];W[gl];B[hn];W[in];B[jo];W[fd];B[cd]C[DS: too late now for an invasion of this kind.  B might pull it off, but only if W goofs too.  Also, only peep if you are willing to push through.  Here peeping is of no value.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[cb];W[db];B[ab];W[ae];B[bd];W[ca];B[bb]
C[DS: now B is dead in the corner as points B19 and A16 are miai.];W[ad]
;B[ba]C[DS: this is a wasted move. B cannot get two eyes here.];W[da];B
[dd];W[ed];B[cf]C[DS: these are of no use.];W[df];B[ha];W[gb];B[qk];W[ql]
C[DS: Still no use for B. Same as before.  Peeping here is of no use.  As the B stones on P10 are dead already, linking up to them would be of no value.]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[rj];W[ri];B[ol];W[pk];B[qm];W[rn];B[op];W[pp];B[kh];W[kg]
;B[tt]C[DS: B should have played H15 to force the next move rather than pass.]
;W[jk];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[DS: Game over.  W wins by 39.5 points.  If B could have connected his dragon, the outcome would have been very close.]
;C[DS: If B had been able to save his big Dragon on the left, the best he could have done would have been in the variation and would have led W by only 3.5 points.  In this variation I am assuming the B group is alive and connected, though it really isn't.]
