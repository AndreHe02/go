C[First and basic question: could you say what moves is bad or/and unnecesarry?
Second question: should black resign on move 124?

Thanks for you.

ps: sorry for my bad english.];B[qd]C[B: Howdy. Im Baga...about 4-6kyu KGS]

(;W[nd];B[cn];W[co];B[bo];W[cp];B[bk]C[B: So much fighting is unnecessary. Hes ALIVE. Why strengthen it by trying to kill it? There are a lot of better moves around the board.]

(;W[cl];B[bl];W[cm];B[bm];W[dn];B[ci]C[B:Still fighting too much. Make territory on the top left instead maybe?]

(;W[cj];B[bj];W[bn];B[an];W[bp];B[dj];W[ck]C[B: What did you accomplish? A one-point gain? Not worth it. Instead take as much side  territory as you can!]
;B[cf];W[di];B[ch]C[Id paly n the third line here. That gives the Black Stone at K16 less room to make a base later in the game.]

(;W[ed];B[ef];W[gd];B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[ld];B[ke]C[Id build a base instead. L17...
That way you attack him and strengthen yourself. Building a base in the other direction is not such a good move as you strengthen him and yourself.]

(;W[le];B[kf];W[oe];B[qf];W[og];B[ph]C[You are simply strengthening him. Build a base now at Q17 or invade R5... or play M3 (Q17 reccommended as its weakest)]

[po][op][pp]C[Notice how you are making him stronger in the marked region. Bad idea.]
;B[ei];W[ej];B[dh];W[fi];B[eh]TR[hi][ii][hk]C[B:A move at any of the marked points is better. You played too close. It didnt help you secure territory or moyo.]

TR[ml][nl][ol][mm][nm][om][mn][nn][on]C[Always try to imagine two or three moves ahead. Play untimed if you have to. It is obvious now that you are strengthening the marked area right?]

;W[sn];B[rp]TR[kq]C[Wrong move. Protecting  the marked region makes you many more points!]
;W[ao];B[am];W[pk];B[ok];W[jm];B[lo];W[kp]C[Congratulations on your win! 
Yes, Black should resign. Your lead is too great. 
But there is a lot of room for improvement :)

Good luck on your future games.])
