C[Hello reviewer-

Thanks for taking the time to review this game. I have put my questions throughout the sgf file.

parts i was unsure about: fight from 20-61
dealing with black 81 invasion

Thank you,


FM: Hi, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with "FM:" as my nick is FieldMouse :)]

;B[df];W[db];B[cc];W[ic];B[kc];W[ed]C[too slow?

FM: yes, this move is quite slow. Black cannot directly destroy whites position here so playing on the last empty side was better]
;B[qn];W[nq];B[pj];W[nc];B[pf]
(;W[pc]TR[kc]C[was this ok?

FM: this is a good technique when white wants to live. But as whites aim should be to attack the marked stone to use the thick group this move is not optimal.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[oc];W[pb];B[od];W[ob];B[rc]
(;W[nd]C[ok? letting black get the peep is painful.. but this seems important

FM: I think this is better. The center is now the important area]
;B[mb];W[nb]
(;B[ld]C[FM: a little slow];W[qd]C[probe. aji keshi?

FM: it is a bit aji keshi, but not a big deal]
(;B[rd]C[FM: this is an agressive way of play];W[qe];B[re]LB[qh:A]
C[FM: black payed a high price for keeping white eyeless as A is quite nasty now]

(;W[ne]C[FM: this move is too slow]
(;B[of]C[FM: seems good but there is still a lot of bad aji in blacks position]

(;W[lf]LB[lb:B][md:A]C[is this the right spot? the shape looks wrong for white... but i wanted to put pressure on black stones. better ideas?

FM: this move is okay. It is hard for black to cut here and even if black prepares the position for cutting still white will be able to live by playing A at sente and then B.]

(;B[id];W[hc]
(;B[kf]LB[je:A]TR[id]C[FM: questionable, helps white to protect the weakness in the shape. A instead of the marked move was better]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[le];B[ke];W[lh];B[mg];W[lg]
(;B[cb]LB[ih:C][on:B][fp:A]C[FM: too slow. A and B were the big points here, but C is cruial from the attack and defense point of view]

(;W[dc];B[de]
(;W[jd]LB[ih:A]C[maybe bad timing?

FM: this destroys blacks eye shape, but black has no problems with running out. I'd prefer directly jumping to A]
;B[jc];W[ie]
(;B[if];W[hd];B[je];W[ih]LB[ff:A]C[direction question. should i play from center like this or come out around A? or leave it?

FM: forcing black to take neutral points and taking center is definitely good here]
;B[gf]
(;W[dq]C[FM: not small, but not most urgent right now];B[gh]
C[FM: please compare with the position when white played this move - the difference is big]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[qh]TR[ro][rp]C[FM: the marked exchange limits white possibilities of making eyes on the side now so white should play this invasion before the marked exchange was played]

(;B[qg]C[FM: black missed the key shape point here];W[rg];B[qf]
C[FM: so painful to play this move];W[ql];B[pl];W[pk];B[ok]
;W[qk];B[pm];W[qj];B[pi]
(;W[qi]LB[rm:A]C[i think this should have ben at A

FM: I disagree];B[rm];W[rl]C[FM: because of blacks mistakes the right side ended in disaster for black]
;B[jq]TR[ih][lh][hp]C[i don't think i handled this correctly. please some advice on dealing with this invasion.

FM: in position like this white must take care of the weak groups in the first place - the marked ones. making territory in the process is a good idea too.]
;W[iq]C[FM: this move is good];B[jo]
(;W[qq]C[FM: big but slow. Black could invade, but not destroy the corner entirely.]
;B[ho]TR[ih][lh]C[this was painful

;B[el];W[cn];B[bm];W[fl];B[fk];W[gk]C[FM: there are some reading mistakes after this point, but from the strategical point of view the game is finished. There were lots of slow moves in this game - both black and white played many times somthing to get points instead of occupying the key points from the attack and defense point of view. Especially tha J12 move for white and G12 move for black were the moves that were very important. and could make a big difference if occupied by the other player. The strategical losing move (if I do not count reading mistakes) was L7, where black did not use the last chance to launch a really serious attack on the white group.]

(;W[go];B[hn];W[gp]LB[jn:A]C[FM: locally white is good here. Got both lower left and right and black is left with a bad cut at A. Whites only problem is not to die with the upper right group as black gets more and more strenght on the lower side]

(;B[ih]TR[lj][ll][ln]C[FM: very nice spot to play. Suddenly the left side feels more like black points and the right side is a little harder to invade and white might be forced to play on the marked neutral points line.]
