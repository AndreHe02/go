C[Hello, thanks for the review!  I looked over this game and I really can't find many points where I went wrong.  I'd also say this is a good representation of my normal playing style/ability (probably why I have stayed 14k for so long).

JWS: Hello. Although i realised when I first played through your game that our strength difference isn't very big I do hope I can make some worthfull remarks.

[The comments are primarely made for black\].];B[pd];W[dc];B[pq]
;W[dp];B[ce]LB[pd:B][de:A]C[JWS: I do think I like A better. Your move invites white to take the outside. A white wall would take away strength of B, which you played high and aims for influence rather than for territory.]
;W[dg];B[ee];W[fc];B[cc]LB[ee:A]C[JWS: this move doesn't very well after you played A. The reason is white's next move.]
;W[dd]LB[bc:C][cc:B][ee:A]C[JWS: Now it's easy for white to cut of A or B without mucht compensation. If you had played B at C, white's move wouldn't have been so strong.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[bg];W[cg];B[bf];W[bh]LB[ee:A]C[JWS: White has sealed black in at both sides. A doesn't seem to be very happy.]
;B[qk];W[jp];B[jd];W[md];B[hc]LB[jd:A][md:C][ee:D][jf:B][pf:E]
C[JWS: This move doesn't do a lot and I doubt if white has to answer it locally. You have to play atround here, because A is weak. I would consider B. It also helps A, but it's farther away from white's strength and puts more pressure on C. Finally it gives more hope to use D in the future.

As white I would like to continue around E after the text move. If white develops strength around here, your A-group will be under lots of pressure.]
;W[fd];B[lc];W[mc]
(;B[cn]C[JWS: White now has a weak group at the top (because he answwered H17 and gave you the opportunity to play M16. Your group at the top isn't too safe either. When there are two weak groups close to each other it's often best to play from your group (and thus strenghtening it) attacking teh opponents group.]
;W[ld]C[JWS: a good move by white. Strenghtening his weak stones. You'll have to answer it, so it is sente for white.]
;B[kc];W[cp];B[ck];W[ci];B[en];W[fq]
(;B[mp]C[Slow. The top is the most important, because Black and White have weak groups.]
;W[qf]TR[mp]C[Compare the impact of this move and the marked black move. White's stone threathens the corner and help his N16-group, while the black stone only gives black the opportunity to grab some points.]
;B[oe];W[qh]
(;B[qc]C[JWS This is not good. It's essential to keep the two white groups split. One will likely fall.]
;W[lg]
(;B[re];W[qe]
(;B[rd];W[qd];B[oc];W[og]TR[hc][kc][lc][jd]C[JWS: ouch. You have won points in the corner, but in return white has almost saved his two groups. This puts a lot of pressure on the marked group.]
;B[jf]C[JWS: It's good to help your group. But now a move like this has less effect because the white group is a lot stronger.]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[qm]TR[qh]C[JWS: Now that white has developed strenght around the marked stone, this has become an effective move.]
;B[ok]TR[qd][qe][qf][lg][og][qh]C[At this point I feel like 49 is a safe move, putting W48 in jeopardy, but with a series of forcing moves, I believe my opponent got a much better result than I wanted.

JWS: If you only look at 48 and 49 you are right. But white has developed a lot of strenght above your stones with the marked stones. That means that when white runs out, you have to deffend your stones instead of attacking the white stones.]

;W[no];B[mr];W[lp]
(;B[lr];W[mo];B[jr];W[kk]TR[kl]C[JWS: white has strengtened his group at the bottom so now he can attanck your middle group with extra power. What white has done is called a leaning attack. Instead of attacking directely a weak group, you first attack another group, thus strengthening the group you want to attack the group with. 

I do think a white stone at the marked spot would have been more effective.]
;B[ll];W[kl];B[pi];W[qi];B[nh];W[pj];B[oi];W[qj];B[ng]C[JWS: Good! White has helped you by making ths possible (Q10 doesn't look the right move at the right time to me).]
;W[pk];B[nf]TR[mb][mc][ld][md][lg]C[JWS: Well done. You have connected your weak group and now the marked group is in trouble, because you cut the connection of that group with that on the side.]
;W[ke];B[je];W[li]
(;B[ge]C[JWS: you should continue the attack on the white group (see variation).]

[mn][lo][cq][dq][br][cr][dr][er][bs][cs][ds][es]C[JWS: white is connected.

Let's have a look at the situation. Black has a lot more secure territroy than white. (see the marks; it's an estimation, I am not too good in counting). Black's main problem is is the marked group that isn't secured yet.

Because black has more points, he can play safely. The best option seems to strengthen black's weak group, in that way preparing an attack on white's group above, that also doesn't seem completely secure.]
;B[go]TR[ep]C[JWS: I like the direction. Maybe a move at the triangle is better, because white needs to answer.]
;W[el]C[JWS: white has noticed this is black's last weak group.]
;B[dl];W[em];B[dm];W[gm];B[fn];W[gl]C[JWS: now that black's group has become stronger (with the help of white's attack), you could consider attacking white's group.]

JWS: If you wouldn't have made the two big mistakes in the end game, the game would have been close. A pity, because you played well.

In general, I would advise you to see which groups on the board are weak. Keep them seperated and attack your opponents weak groups from your weak groups. If you do that more consequentely, you will become soon become stronger than 14k.

Have fun!
