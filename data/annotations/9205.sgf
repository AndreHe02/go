C[Hi, I played black this game. Thank you for the review.

I aimed for a lot of center influence in this game.  Only have my influence destroyed by white leaving me with almost no territory in the center.  I think I made a lot of mistakes during the middle game leaving invasion.  And I wasn't too happy with some of the placements of the stones.


----

summary:

I see two main flaws in black's game here.  First, black makes many weak groups while trying to make influence.  Remember weak groups project negative influence.  They give your opponent things to attack.   

Second, be more aware of keeping sente.  I've marked many places where black plays gote moves instead of taking sente.  Before each move, ask yourself what value you think the move is and whether it is gote or sente.  If it is gote, ask yourself if you must play this move or if there is a sente move that gives you the same value.

Yeah - this move doesn't look very effective.  It doesn't help secure R11, it doesn't expand your influence, and it doesn't contain r6, so it seems low value.]

(;W[lk];B[kg]C[white has no problem living, so surrounding isn't nearly as threatening as it would have been earlier in the game.  are you trying to make sure you can escape out?  
 
If you were going to play a move here, you should ask things like:

- does this move make any territory?
- does it expand/strengthen a group?
- does it threaten any opposing group?

You should be thinking about helping g15 group, expanding the top group or making sure the right group is alive]
