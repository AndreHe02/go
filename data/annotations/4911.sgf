C[This is quite a simple game. No big fights, no stupid mistakes, no brilliant moves. So how do I end up losing by 20+ moku?

Llywelyn: Here are some general ideas that will help you play better:

* Look for breathing room: when looking for big plays, play on the widest side and don't cling to your opponents stones.

* As Janice Kim might say, Go is a giant game of chicken.  Don't respond passively--take the initiative, take sente, and fight back.  On every move, look to see if you can get more bang for your buck by not responding than by responding.

* Go is about more than pretty shapes, but shape is a big part of it.  Work on making good shape with your stones and try to see if there is a better way of accomplishing the same goals.

I've made some more specific comments throughout the game, prefixing my comments with "Llywelyn".  Let me know if you have any further questions.]

Llywelyn: White's decision to attach here is qustionable at best.  That said, yes, O16 is by far the best and most active response.]

(;B[nc]C[Llywelyn: Very passive.  No threat and it gives W good shape for free while leaving B weak.]
;W[pc]
(;B[ld]C[Llywelyn: This move is questionable.   It gets black out, but doesn't do much to form a base.  The 4th line also indicates a desire to expand, but there's nowhere really to expand *to*.]
;W[jc]C[Llywelyn: White's move is probably premature, but strikes at B's vital point.]

(;B[hc]C[Llywelyn:  There are a few problems with this move.

* Wrong direction.  Both the east and west sides have enormous growth potential, while there is very little in the north.  

* It is a "self-hurting" move.  It forces W to run, which leaves B split with two weak groups.   White is likely to profit on both sides while B tries to save his three stones.

* Too far away to threaten the corner, and thus it is not in a good position (so tightly sandwhiched) to make life without giving away too much territory and/or influence to White.]
;W[je];B[ec]LB[fd:A][lf:B]C[Llywelyn: This is what a friend of mine would call an "armpit hit."  It is like tenuking from a shoulder hit--not generally a good idea.  

It is basically the same as starting on the E17 point and then tenuking after white plays D16.  

Because of H17, it is very difficult to find a good move for black now.   Black desperately needs both A and B.]
;W[dc];B[he];W[gd];B[ed]LB[hd:A]C[Llywelyn: "Even a moron connects against a peep."

Most of this stems from B's earlier play at E17, and the sequence that follows is very ugly for black.]
;W[hd];B[id];W[ie]
(;B[jd]C[Okay, this move was probably a mistake. If I had to play it again, I'd probably go with j17.]
;W[ic];B[kd];W[gc];B[ge];W[fe];B[ff]LB[hg:A]C[Llywelyn: Shape matters. W wants to play E15, and with this move B makes her do so with very little to show for it.

It also doesn't secure the stones, giving too many good followups (in sente) for white.  A move such as "A" is dual purpose.  It secures B's cutting stones (H15) from being caught in a ladder, and simultaneously puts pressure on W's two weak stones (that are also cutting stones).    

Later, it may be possible to save E16 (or at least use the threat of saving them effectively), or W has to take a move (in gote) to secure them.]

;B[hg]LB[gh:A]TR[gg]C[Llywelyn: Unless B plans to kill, it is better to simply run out and apply pressure at A.  This will bring B's group out into the center without leaving the critical weakness at G13 behind, while still threatening H13.]

(;W[if]LB[dj:Air][pj:Air][jp:Air];B[hi]C[Llywelyn: "Hark, I see a sleazy dress."

Black and White's stones are clinging to each other.  There is a huge amount of empty space, and neither side can seem to play anywhere but right on top of the other.]
;W[ih];B[cg];W[cf];B[dg];W[mg];B[of];W[qf];B[qh]LB[ng:A][jp:B]
C[Llywelyn: What is the purpose of this move?

It seems like an attack on a live group.

If the purpose is to help Black's northern group, then the cut at Q13 keeps that from being worth much.  White's R16 group is alive and low, so it isn't going to expand very far, and K13 is almost too big to die. 

So let's look elsewhere for a moment.

A is a good shape move, locally, and puts some pressure on W's group.

B is a nice, broad, BIG move.  It works increadibly well with B's thickness at E14 and with B's influence stones at Q4 and D4.]

(;W[mj]
(;B[qm]C[Llywelyn: B attempts to reach for R12... but R12 is low, weakened by the cut at Q13, and W's check at N10 keeps there from being much to go on.

The widest side is the South.];W[fq]C[Llywelyn: White gets the best play on the board.]

(;B[dn]C[Llywelyn: B is getting very close to his own thickness, while giving W the premium space in the south.]
;W[mq]
(;B[or]C[Llywelyn: This move doesn't really protect the corner, and it doesn't really attack White.  W's move doesn't threaten the corner, so there should be no rush to protect it.]
;W[jp];B[hq]C[Llywelyn: B is asking for trouble.  By crawling under and living here, B has to recognize that it gives W an enormous amount of center influence.  By living, B can actually make it harder for herself.]
