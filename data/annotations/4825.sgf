K- hi, I'm your reviewer for today, marking my comments like this]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]C[moutard [18k\]: no cigarette this time]
;W[cc]C[mars242 [18k\]: hehe....
mars242 [18k\]: i quit on new years... :(];B[ed]C[K- the usual approach moves here are 4-4 point (D16) and the large knights' moves (F16 & D14). D16 emphasises the centre, the others emphasise the side. In this case D16 and F16 would both be fine.]
;W[df]C[K- this would be the correct response if B had played F16, but here looks rather loose. D15 or C15 would be better.]
;B[cd];W[dc]C[K- W D14 was a light move, this is a heavy move. Meaning, after B E16, W D14 offered to give away the corner in return for territory on the side, whereas D17 is trying to keep the corner. These moves contradict each other so W is going to have problems here]
;B[dd];W[ec];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[bc]C[K- B16 would be better, pushing back at B]
;B[bd];W[di]C[K- possibly better to play at D10, allow B to invade at D12, and build a wall facing D4]
;B[gb]
(;W[eb]C[K- E19 is better, it makes E18 an eye if W plays D18 later]
;B[fa];W[ea]C[K- not necessary, W can allow B to play here then W D19. W should play the vital point B19 here]
;B[ac]
(;W[ab];B[cb]
(;W[ad]C[K- W needs to make eyes, this move does not help. See variation for example]
;B[be]C[K- makes bad shape (empty triangle), B14 would be good here]
;W[bf];B[ae];W[bb];B[ba];W[fd]C[K- does W have a plan here? the ladder is B's at the moment]
;B[fe];W[da];B[ca];W[pj]C[K- not quite a ladder breaker]
(;B[ge]C[K- I would suggest B plays R6 or Q6 here, see variation]
;W[pm];B[qn]C[K- submissive move by B, suggest Q13 as bigger alternative]
;W[pg]C[K- yes];B[qf];W[qg];B[jd]C[K- too close to the wall, over concentrated, suggest K3 or K4 as big points]
;W[jp]C[K- good];B[gp]C[K- B is attacking from the wrong direction, C6 would be best]
;W[dm];B[cq]C[K- doesn't work well with G4. Also, general advice is keep the 3-3 invasion in reserve for when (if) the influence that the defender will get in return is reduced in value. Playing it too early can backfire]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[gr]C[K- B should play B4 instead here, otherwise just helping W to build strength]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[iq];B[ir];W[jr];B[bp];W[bo];B[gn]C[K- G7 or even K7 would be better here, B has to treat G4 lightly or W could get very strong in the centre and/or capture the whole B group]
;W[nq]
(;B[lq]C[K- if B wants to pincer here, could play peep at L3, see variation]
;W[lp];B[kq]C[K- yes];W[jq];B[mp];W[kp];B[mq];W[op];B[np];W[oo]
;B[oq];W[mo];B[no]
(;W[on]C[K- W could play O6, giving B a large corner but getting huge influence in return, see variation]

[ip]C[K- I agree with your comments, W nearly won but didn't get the whole kill on B's centre left group, and W plays a more centre/influence style game (and almost won because of it).

Advice for B would be to look out for big points that are sometimes more important than local moves (e.g. see moves 37 & 42).

Advice for W would be consider playing a different opening - the 3-3 stone does not enhance your influence oriented style.

Good game, I enjoyed doing the review. Feel free to email me any further questions]

(;B[pn];W[pg];B[md]C[K- B is building his position in bottom right while preventing W playing an easy ladder breaker. W gets a 2nd stone on the right side, but B has almost got the whole top side in compensation. I prefer B's position here.]

(;B[qn];W[on]C[K- this is a more territorial move for B but W gets this ladder breaking cap]
