;B[qf]C[regginos 14k*: hello from Cyprus!];W[dp];B[nq]C[[jrm\] These corner plays are non-standard of course. Playing one 3,6 point might be interesting, but 2 of them this way is asking for trouble. If you insist on 2  3,6s, then this should be R6 which coordinates with R14.]
;W[ed];B[jc]C[[jrm\] Black's plays don't seem to have any overall opening strategy.]

C[[jrm\] Black is inviting White to attack around L3 which would strengthen White. Better to make a base by playing L3 yourself.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[np];B[nr];W[iq]C[[jrm\] White's attack is too loose, L3 still worth considering (If Black pincers in response, White running out creates leaves Black with 2 weak groups to defend.)]
;B[qq]C[maybe this is weak? is it better N6 or R9 leaving the possibility for R3 later when the R6 group becomes stronger? [jrm\] The O2 and R6 groups are both weak, this move will further weaken R6 after White S4 and only marginally helps O2. L3, R9, R10 all probably better.]
;W[rp];B[mn];W[qm]C[[jrm\] Protecting this point was more urgent  than N6 - too late now.]
;B[ql];W[rm];B[rl];W[pl];B[om];W[rn];B[nm];W[pk];B[qj];W[pj]
;B[qi];W[pi];B[ph];W[re];B[rf];W[oh];B[pg];W[mi];B[nj]C[[jrm\] Too early I think. Leave this for later and build up strength on the  outside before playing here - consider moves around N15, K10/11 or push on J3 before this attack.]
;W[mj];B[nk]C[[jrm\] This lets White get O11 and White has escaped. Take O11 instead, if White plays O9, then Black runs away at O12. If White responds at O12, THEN Black takes O9 and White can be cut at P11 or N12 and Black comes out better.]
;W[ni];B[ng]C[[jrm\] White's already escaped, save this idea for later perhaps. A move near the center star point might get white to play around N14, then a Black play around M16 defends Black's top and also keeps up the attack.]
;W[lg];B[mf]C[[jrm\] Black's P16 group has safety in at least 2 ways (Black P14 or make a base at the top), so White M13 wasn't much of a threat (just a little reduction in Black's top territory). I'd use this move on a bigger point (the left, the bottom, attack E16, etc.)]
;W[dj]C[by now I felt I did a good job at the right side but white has a lot of influence at the left. How should I continue? [jrm\] White has 2 small territories in the upper right corner and the bottom right side. Black has a few points on the middle right side and around O15. Black's O2 group is a little weak but should survive an attack (not really any points there.) White is 4 moves ahead on the  left side: I fear Black is already far behind. One plan: invade the upper left corner being sure to end in sente (if I knew how to do that for sure I'd be 3 stones stronger :-) and then take the C3 point, use extensions from N6 and K17 to reduce the middle and hope White ends up without too much to show for those 4 stones.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[gc]C[I believe this is inconsistent. Probably B15? [jrm\] G17 feels wrong - it forces White to move where White wanted to play anyway.]
;W[dd];B[ge]C[[jrm\] Too small. Black gets little extra territory, doesn't threaten White and barely reduces White's middle.]
;W[lf];B[le];W[hd];B[gd];W[dg];B[eb];W[db];B[gg];W[lo];B[mo]
;W[lq];B[km]C[[jrm\] Good, don't let White force a move at N3, otherwise White will control 2/3 of the board with one more move.]
;W[rq];B[qr]C[connecting was urgent, I suppose [jrm\] The eventual loss of these stones is pretty big. After White N3, Black can save these with Q3, but ends in gote again.]
;W[mq];B[lp];W[kq];B[kp];W[pq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[bs];W[ho]C[at this point I thought : "if I manage to kill the central white group - I win" [jrm\] I played out the obvious boundaries, and IF Black kills the central White group, Black is up by only 18 points. White could give up N11 by playing many escape threats from the outside and probably make up that difference.]
;B[im]C[this move is not doing much towards my idea of killing the group . maybe J14 ? of course my own Central group is not safe yet! [jrm\] If that's the plan, better to play  several moves like E12, E8, etc. hoping that White defends the left side, then Black will be stronger for the central kill and have more options if L7 needs to run.]
;W[hf];B[gf];W[he];B[jj]C[[jrm\] Too loose to threaten a kill. Maybe K/L 15 first ...]
;W[ke];B[ld];W[ji];B[ij]C[[jrm\] Too passive if you're still trying to kill. L11 has possibilities, at least to kill part of the center ...]
;W[ii];B[hi];W[hh];B[gh];W[hj];B[gi];W[hg];B[jg]C[waste if time! the white group is alive!]
