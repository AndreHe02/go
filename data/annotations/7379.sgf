;B[pd]C[Kalakaa [11k\]: hf];W[cp]C[Kentar [11k\]: Have a good game.]
;B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[ce];B[eq];W[ep];B[fp];W[dq];B[fq]C[This should be at e5, then you usually fix on top at f5 rather than here at f3.  If you don't mind being low, then you want to play d3 instead of f4 to begin with.]
;W[eo]C[White's shape is perfect now.];B[fn];W[fo];B[go];W[gn]
;B[fm];W[dm]C[white should atary at h5, probably, instead of d7, then can come back to d7 if he'd like.]
;B[hn];W[ej];B[ho]C[Was it best to connect here or should I have played elsewhere?

Definitely play elsewhere, the way to tell is, does your shape collapse?  If white plays g4, for instance, you can still play h5, then white descends at g3 and you can g2 in response.  in this way white get's a heavy group and you crawl on the second line -- that's rather acceptable since you have such an open board.

Instead, play on the top o17 or k16.];W[lp];B[jp]C[Should I have approached from the other side?

Both sides are thick, so you should just try to remove white's base.  k4 should be at k3, then, which hurts white's attempts to make eyes.]
;W[kq];B[no];W[ln];B[qj]C[This move should definitely be on the top.  Also you should probably reply to l3 by playing k3.]
;W[nc];B[pg];W[jd]C[White makes a bigger moyo.  Now the key point is e15.]
;B[mm]C[Attacking is also OK.];W[mn];B[nn];W[iq];B[jq];W[jr]
;B[mq];W[lq];B[mp];W[ko];B[jo];W[jn];B[hp];W[hq];B[ge]C[I wasn't sure where to play to reduce here.  Perhaps I should have invaded the left side?

E15 is a normal reduction move.

Since your attack was a failure on the bottom, you may need to consider a deep invasion instead.]
;W[gc];B[gg];W[eg];B[gi];W[gk];B[gl];W[hl];B[fk];W[hm];B[gm]
;W[im];B[gj];W[el];B[hk];W[nm];B[om];W[nl];B[ol];W[ml]C[Up to this point, black is doing OK, but he must still invade on the left or there is little hope.  He can first attack the top if he wishes.]
;B[ne]C[This move seems very close to q13  if you wanted to play on this side, then you'd play o16 to press white more severely.  Instead of this side, I would advise m17, you have both ladders (m17 m16 l16 leads to either a ladder to capture k16 or a ladder to capture m16).]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[lc]C[Now that white is safe in the corner this move is not as severe.]
;W[md];B[nd];W[ld];B[mf];W[od]C[This is a good shape point for both, if black played p17 he becomes much more thick, and vice versa.]
;B[oe];W[rd]C[B];B[qe]C[black should take first, if white gets in on the right, so be-it, at least black get's compensation on the top too.]
;W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[kc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]C[After the forcing moves on the left white only has a ko to worry about.]
;W[od];B[ek];W[oc]C[I don't think ignoring was best now an invasion on the left will succeed.  White has let the river flood into his area.]
;B[dk]C[This is fine, but you could also consider c9, and probably a few other further away moves, threatening a large life or connection.]
;W[dj];B[ck]C[should probably hane instead.];W[cj];B[cm];W[cn]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[an]C[This hane is big yose, but b10 is even bigger.]
;W[ao];B[am];W[bo];B[nk];W[sg];B[rh]C[Playing this way is OK, but should play T14 first then for better yose, otherwise should just hane at t12.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[ef];B[fd];W[ee];B[gd];W[fc];B[ed];W[ec];B[dd]
;W[cd];B[de];W[df];B[nj]C[Certainly play the atari here if you are trying to grow.]
;W[lj];B[mh];W[mi];B[ni];W[mj];B[lh]C[So you can now atari since N11 was a mistake, that's probably better than m12 first.]
;W[lf];B[lg];W[hf];B[gf];W[hd];B[sf]C[good eye here.];W[se]
;B[sh];W[rc]C[My opponent did not need to connect here as long as he/she did not connect at T14, right?

Right, here he is deperate to win this ko, it is too early to worry about that.  Without S17 he just has to give up t13.]
;B[kf];W[le];B[kh];W[jf];B[jg];W[ig];B[fh];W[hh];B[gh];W[eh]
;B[kj]C[It would be better to atari directly I think.];W[kk]
;B[mk];W[ll];B[lk];W[jj]C[Now white get's to save more.];B[ki]
;W[jl];B[bj];W[bi];B[aj]C[Generally you don't descend you connect back.  Now white has a11 as sente.]
;W[ai];B[bk];W[he];B[lr];W[kr];B[ls];W[ks];B[mr];W[io];B[ip]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[fr];B[dl]C[I didn't realize until now that my whole group was in danger of dying!  Could my opponent have killed by playing here?

No, you still have 1.5 eyes at a8, and another half eye at j5 at the least.]
;W[em];B[er];W[dr];B[gr];W[hr];B[gs];W[hs];B[fs];W[in];B[ds]
;W[cs]C[If you count and you are behind, this is a kind of ko you should fight.  If you are ahead, it is OK to take.  For white, the same argument (he should play c2 instead of c1 if he is ahead).]
;B[es];W[cr];B[je];W[ke];B[if];W[ie];B[jf];W[jh];B[kg];W[hg]
;B[ji];W[ih];B[ij];W[jk];B[ii]C[this move is overly safe, but the moves for points are running thin.]
;W[hi];B[hj];W[ik];B[me];W[mc]C[Also unneeded I think.];B[ei]
;W[di];B[fi]C[S];W[ch];B[mo];W[lo];B[en];W[dn];B[sf];W[qm]C[Did I have to respond to this?

In my experience, unless you are going to lose because of not getting this ko (that is, count), you should just reply to moves like this.  At the least, it is polite.  At the most, yes you did but didn't realize it!  (or maybe make a mistake).]

Well games tend to be very chaotic at any kyu level, so it's hard to say where you win or lose a game.  Mistakes were made by both, good moves made by both too.  I hope this review has helped -- sorry for the tardiness.]
