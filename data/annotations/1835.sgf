RE[W+12]

C[Hello, I'm nicomerc (30k on IGS), I play as black versus gnugo
and I lose the game by "only" 12 points (It's the first time
i have a "good" score versus a computer).

After reviewing my game, I don't find big mistakes....but I'm
only 30k....So I would like to have some comments about my game
and in particularly about the opening of the game (where I think
i have certainly lose some points, but I don't know where...).

** zenjutsu:

INTRODUCTION:
I am the reviewer, Dimitri.  I reside in the USA, and play as
'zenjutsu' (15k*) on IGS.  I will preface my comments with the
notation shown above.  After reading this review, please email
any additional questions to me.  Also, I apologize in advance
for not having enough skill to offer 'perfect' feedback or move
suggestions.  Hopefully my suggestions will still be valuable
to you.

GAME COMMENTS:

First, a score correction.  The score was 94.5 to 77.  White
won by 17.5.  See end of game for score summary.

Second, a kudos.  Most 30k do not take the time to review their
own games-- and they should.  Keep up the good work and you will
find your skill constantly improving.

Third, a general comment.  The Japanese word 'tesuji' translates
roughly to 'play elsewhere'.  It means that an opponent places
a stone that is not threatening enough to justify responding
to it because there are bigger plays to make.  Computer opponents
are infamous for moving to the 'small game' too soon-- so you
must decide whether to respond to their play, or ignore it and
play elsewhere.

Fourth, a commendation.  Overall, I found your play to be much
stronger than most 30k.  My guess is that your rank will jump
past 30k in no time.  Many of the plays you make are not typical
of 30k-- they show better understanding of the game and more
foresight of where the board is going.  This is very good-- keep
it up!

Last, an endgame comment.  Go scores under standard IGS scoring
are composed by adding:

1. surrounded territory (not including stones on the board)
2. captured stones
3. the komi (for white)

Therefore, "giving free prisoners" to your opponent is the same
thing as giving them a free point.  Likewise, filling in your
own territory without reason is the same thing as subtracting
a point from yourself.  I'll be pointing out at least 12 end-game
stones that black played which either unnecessarily reduced black's
score by 1, or increased white's by 1.];B[pd];W[dp];B[oq]C[Its a mistake....I would play Q3....

** zenjutsu:

Some high-rank players use the 3-5 point as an opening.  Personally,
I am not strong enough to feel confident using it.  Most fuseki
guides recommend the 4-4, 3-4, or 3-3 as the safest opening points;
the 3-5, 4-5, and others are categorized as riskier openings.

Your intention to play the 3-4 point (Q3) is a good one.];W[dd]

(;B[qo]C[Perhaps Q5 is better??

** zenjutsu:

If you originally intended to play the 3-4 point (Q3) followed
by the 5-3 point (small-knight corner enclosure), then you could
have played at R4 to get the same result, just flipped sides.
(See alternative move tree 'b')

Otherwise, this stone looks fine to me.

Regarding Q5, see alternative move tree 'c'.];W[nd];B[pf]C[** zenjutsu:

Good.  Follow standard joseki when possible and/or applicable.]
;W[pc];B[qc]C[** zenjutsu:

Very good.  Use standard joseki when possible and/or applicable.]
;W[oc];B[id]SQ[qb]C[I try to invade...

** zenjutsu:

This invasion may be early.  The joseki in the top-right is not
yet complete; the standard follow-up to P17 is R18.  While leaving
a joseki in mid-stream is always possible, do so with the knowledge
that your opponent may come back to take advantage of the incomplete
joseki before you complete it.

Otherwise, the placing of the invasion is miai (it allows you
two directions to move and make life) which is good.];W[dg]

(;B[gc]SQ[kc][lc][fc]C[Is this move on the good side (perhaps L or M17 are better) ??

** zenjutsu:

If continuing with the invasion (as opposed to finishing the
joseki in top right), then there are a few things wrong with
this move:

1. It is too small.  For a larger move, you could have large-kinght-jumped
to F17.  However, F17 still suffers from problem 2 (next).

2. It loses sente (initiative).  Playing to the right forces
white to respond and fight for life.  Personally, of the two
options to the right, I prefer M17 over L17.

However, you could also apply pressure on white's top-right group,
solidify your top-right group, and still have miai to make life
on top-center by finishing the joseki in the top-right.  (see
alternative move tree 'b')];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb]C[** zenjutsu:

Now white's top-right is very secure, no matter what you do.
Also, white has sente (initiative).  Last, your top group is
not yet established.  White has gained a great deal in the exchange
in the top-right because the joseki was not completed.];B[sd]
TR[kp][kq][jq][cc][cl][ck][cn][fq][jp][pk][qk][pi][pj][qj][qi]
[lc]SQ[sc][qd]C[** zenjutsu:

White's move was tesuji.  You don't have to respond to it.  This
would be an excellent time to play elsewhere on the board.  Think
big at this point in the game.  Try one of the triangle-marked
points.

However, if you insist on responding to white's small play, I
think I prefer either of the square-marked points.  More direct.]
;W[qh]C[** zenjutsu:

Now white has greatly reduced your territory on the right, while
simultaneously threatening the survival of your top-right group.
You _must_ respond to this stone.];B[qj]C[** zenjutsu:

Pincer.  Good.];W[lc]TR[ok][oj][ph][fq][kp][kq][jq][jp][ck]
[cl][cn][cc]C[** zenjutsu:

White plays here because he needs to secure eyes for the top-right
group.  However, the play might be tesuji for you.  You can (and
did) respond to it.  However your top stones are not yet threatened.
They can still make life toward the top-left, or run to the center.

Perhaps a triangle instead of your play (upcoming, at L17).]
;B[kc]C[** zenjutsu:

Too small.  See comments at previous move.  Also, white retains
sente.];W[jp]
(;B[ck]C[I try to invade the left side...

** zenjutsu:

Good.  At this point, if white establishes a stone there before
you, you will be battling against a large territory.

However, you may be able to retain sente by playing at the bottom
right first.  See alternative move tree 'b'.];W[lp];B[cq]C[White doesn't respond so I invade the corner.
Is it move adequate ? Is a C5 or C6 move better?

** zenjutsu:

I don't like C5.  A three-space jump is too much to make a strong
shoulder-hit invasion.  C6 would be fine, however I rather like
this corner invasion stone.  ...but then one of my largest weaknesses
is playing too aggressive.  If you are concerned that this corner
move is to aggressive, I'm the wrong person to ask.  Sorry I'm
not more helpful on this inquiry.];W[dq]C[It the start of the only joseki that I know.. :)

** zenjutsu:

You do very well with this joseki in the corner.  Excellent work!

To learn more about joseki, visit GoBase.org];B[cp];W[co];B[bo]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq]C[** zenjutsu:

Good job taking the corner.  Also, white's group is weak at the
bottom-right (due to your group's lower position) and the center
(due to your C9 stone).

Last, you can maintain sente and dominate the right for big points,
while simultaneously preventing white from getting the center.]
;B[bm]TR[cc][nn][no][ph]SQ[ek][ch]C[I try to connect with my C9 stone..

** zenjutsu:

Too small a play.  It only gets you a few points, and your C9
stone can make life along the side or escape to the center (square
points)... or make this connection later in the game.

A bigger play would be one of the triangles.  I think I like
Q12 the most.];W[oh]C[** zenjutsu:

Ouch.  Now white has clearly escaped from the right side.  Also,
this play is sente.  You _must_ respond (which you do) or risk
losing your entire top right group.  However, as you play out,
white builds an opportunity to attack your entire right side
(which did not happen), and/or build points in the center (which
white chose to do).];B[nf];W[mh]C[** zenjutsu:

Still sente.  You must respond or risk losing the entire group.
White is building a large wall.];B[lf]C[** zenjutsu:

Now your right group is secure (connected to top group), but
white just:

1. ensured the survival of his right stones, thus reducing your
opportunity to build territory there,
2. built an opportunity to take-over the right, and
3. retains sente, thus allowing white to guide the flow of the
game for a little longer.];W[ci];B[bi]TR[mq][lr][ok][cc]C[B10 better??

** zenjutsu:

This play is too deep.  Playing at B10 would be better.  However,
white's play is also tesuji.  You don't need to respond.  If
you ignore this stone, white's follow-up at B10 (just a possible
follow-up) would gain white a few points and lose a few for you.
So you playing at B10 is only worth a half-dozen points... perhaps
up to 10 points, but no more.    On the other hand, playing one of the triangle points will be
worth much more than 10 points.];W[bj]C[Probably...

** zenjutsu:

Yep.];B[cj];W[bh];B[aj]C[** zenjutsu:

Wrong stone.  First, this battle is too small to fuss with right
now.  Save this for later in game (comments before about tesuji
and playing elsewhere for more points).  Second, white can get
out of this atari.  This stone (if it is played in this area)
should be at B9.];W[bk]C[** zenjutsu:

Here's where white escapes your atari, thus costing you a point
or two in lost territory.];B[bl];W[ai];B[cl];W[ec]C[** zenjutsu:

Now it is too late for the proposed C17 invasion.  White's corner
is becoming secure... and large.];B[fe];W[kb];B[jc]C[** zenjutsu:

Good play.  Too many new go players would block at K18-- which
is a mistake.  Good job pulling back instead of trying to block.]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[oj];B[pl]C[** zenjutsu:

Good.  If you played nose-to-nose at P9, it would leave your
right side open to aji (Japanese word that translates roughly
as 'bad taste').  White could then press against right side and
gain points.  Good choice to play where you did.];W[rf]C[** zenjutsu:

Now we're really seeing why letting that white stone survive
on the right was so painful.  Black's stones in top-right have
gone from a large-chunk-of-territory to an oversized dragon (winding
group of stones that do not more than a couple points).]
(;B[qe]C[S15 better?

** zenjutsu:

Either is fine for defense.  ... or consider R16.  See alternative
move tree 'b'.];W[ri];B[rj];W[fb]
(;B[gb]TR[no][nm][nl]SQ[dm]C[** zenjutsu:

I'm not the best at counting territory, but this play looks a
little small.  It prevents white from getting another three or
four points, and gives you another three or four.  Very rough
high-end-estimate of 10 points.

On the other hand, the bottom right can still be built up to
give more than 10 points, and threaten white's growing center
influence.  See the triangle points for potential moves.

I also like the square point... but then remember that I tend
to play a bit too aggressive.  I played out a few moves of the
square point to show why I like it.  See alternative move tree
'b'.];W[mk]C[** zenjutsu:

Now white sees the opportunity to build points in the center,
and threaten your right side.  The difference is that white has
sente in this battle-- largely because white started it.  This
battle is worth far more than what happened on the top.]
(;B[nm]TR[qd][pe][hb][ic][jd][ie][he][gf][ge][gd][hd][hc]SQ[bp]
[am][cs][an][ao][ap][aq][bq][br][ar][as][bs]MA[bo][bn][bm][bl]
[cl][ck][cj][lf][kc][jc][id][gb][gc][fe]C[After reviewing I think that I would have to play something like
G12 for extending to the center for a possible connection between
the marked groups and extend my influence to the center...

** zenjutsu:

Actually, I like the response you made.  It is quite necessary.
If you don't make this stone, then white will play near it and
build territory in the center (just more to the right) while
simultaneously eroding your bottom-right corner enclosure.

The fact that you played here does two things:
1. Expands your territory, and
2. Allows a _third_ major invasion point into the center.  Three
invasion points should allow you to severly reduce white in the
center.

Last, your X-marked stones don't need to be connected.  They
both have eyes to survive (square points, and triangle points).
Connections are only necessary to make life.  What you need isn't
a _connection_ but an invasion point to reduce white's center.
Your play successfully did that.

Just to illustrate, let's see what the board would look like
if you had played at G12.... see alternative move tree 'b'.]
;W[mm];B[nn];W[lj];B[jg]TR[hk][hl]SQ[dm][kh][ig]C[Small move?? G12 or something like this is better??

** zenjutsu:

Yes, this move does look small.  However I'm not certain I like
G12 either.  Your groups are both secure (previous comments).

Perhaps a square-marked play instead?

Or, if you really feel like invading the center, do it with a
triangle.  It looks dangerous, but can easily connect out of
the center and live.

Personally, I like D7 to start invading the center.];W[ln]C[** zenjutsu:

This stone by white feels small to me.  Awkward.  It appears
to be tesuji.];B[mq]C[** zenjutsu:

Good, you didn't respond directly to white's last stone.  It
felt small and unnecessary.];W[fh]C[** zenjutsu:

I know you were eyeballing playing in this area (you mentioned
G12 a few times).  I assume that you find the following exchange
to be painful.  I don't think it was too bad.  There were a few
stones that could have been different, but overall, your decision
to not play at G12 in the actual game did not cause you much
(if any) pain.  I'll try to explain as we progress.

For now, suffice it to say that this stone doesn't hurt you much.]
;B[hf]SQ[gg]C[Small move too?? J11 or something like this is better??

** zenjutsu:

This feels too small to me too.  However, I do like the idea
of gaining a few points of territory here (and solidifying eye
space)-- just not with this particular stone.  Perhaps the square-marked
point?];W[hh];B[ji];W[ii]
(;B[ih]C[** zenjutsu:

I think playing K10 may have been a better stone.  See alternative
move tree 'b'.];W[ij];B[jj]C[** zenjutsu:

The difference with playing K10 now is that white has already
placed J10, and (more importantly) white currently holds sente
(allowing white to guide the development of the game).];W[df]

(;B[fj]C[** zenjutsu:

Invasion to center.  Good.

However, white's potential territory below this (where white
actually makes points in the real game) is much larger than this
area.  See alternative move tree 'b' for a stronger invasion.]
;W[gj];B[gk];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek];B[el]C[** zenjutsu:

Good play.  Playing on this side threatens both the E9 stones
and the C6 stones.];W[en]C[** zenjutsu:

White correctly plays here to prevent you making a direct attack
at D5.  This allows you to capture the E9 stones.];B[ej];W[hp]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[gl];W[hl];B[il];W[hj];B[hm];W[gi];B[di]C[Perhaps it was better to play soething like K7 or K6 ??

** zenjutsu:

Definitely.  This stone is only a few points.  It gains one or
two for you, and costs three or four for white.  However, white
easily makes 10 additional points on the bottom in the following
exchange.];W[im]C[Yes ... :)
I think that the game is play here and that the following moves
are not very "important" for the final result........

Are the previous analysis correct??

** zenjutsu:

At this point, the game is still _very_ close.  I see the game
as dead draw... or leaning in black's favor.    In the last plays (starting around move 223 or so), black makes
some end-move errors that give white at least an additional 12
points.  Also, there are a few moves that make a point-or-two
difference, especially regarding use of sente.

Bottom line: black can still win the game.];B[jk];W[hn];B[gm]
;W[km]
(;B[kl]TR[jm][kr][sb][ch][fc]C[** zenjutsu:

This play is tesuji.  It does not gain any points for black.
It costs white a point or two, but white does not need to respond.
This play loses sente for black.  If you wish to play in that
region, try the play shown in alternative move tree 'b'.

...or play one of the triangles.];W[fg];B[gn];W[in];B[lq]C[** zenjutsu:

Too small.  A more dynamic extension would be L2.];W[kq];B[kr]
TR[ch][jb][fc]C[** zenjutsu:

This stone loses sente.  There are still other plays that do
not lose sente which you can play prior to this stone.  Perhaps
a triangle?];W[jr];B[lr];W[go];B[fn]C[** zenjutsu:

Too small.  Tesuji, which white correctly ignores and plays elsewhere.
A different play could have retained sente, and cost more points
from white.];W[fd];B[gd];W[ee];B[gf];W[fc]C[** zenjutsu:

White just gave you back sente.  Now, you can play a sequence
of plays that white 'must respond to'.]
(;B[fa]C[** zenjutsu:

Unfortunately, white 'must respond to' this play, but you must
respond to white's response.  That means that you lose sente.
White will return to the driving seat of the game.  See the alternative
move tree 'b' for a sample of how you could have maintained sente
and made other plays, then eventually lead to this play.];W[ea]
;B[ga]C[** zenjutsu:

Now white has sente again.  Remember, holding sente is worth
points.  Not literally, but rather in strategic terms.  This
is because you are in the driver's seat when you have sente,
and can guide where the onesy-twosy plays fall-- to your advantage
or your opponent's.];W[fo];B[em]C[** zenjutsu:

Tesuji.  Again, too small.  White's play did not necessarily
require a response.  White played there to secure territory,
not to threaten yours.];W[sj]C[** zenjutsu:

...and this is where white takes the tesuji.  White retains sente
and costs two points from black, while retaining one of his own
_and_ retaining sente.];B[sk];W[si];B[rl];W[dm];B[dl]C[** zenjutsu:

Good response.  Not because it connects your groups (they already
are via playing the capturing stone at D9), but because it is
a force-play.  If white does not respond, then you can play at
D5 and capture white's group (see alternative move tree 'b').]

(;W[eo];B[ch]C[** zenjutsu:

Good.];W[bi];B[dh];W[cg];B[ff];W[ef];B[eh];W[eg];B[gg]C[** zenjutsu:

Oops.  Tesuji.  White can ignore this stone because their groups
can still connect two ways.  Also, this stone does not gain any
territory for black.  Therefore, not only does it lose sente,
but it is a wasted stone.];W[mn];B[mo];W[mp];B[np];W[jb];B[ib]
;W[sb];B[sc];W[lo];B[no];W[ig];B[jh];W[hg];B[if];W[gh];B[jm]
;W[jn];B[jl]C[** zenjutsu:

Tesuji again.  White does not need to respond to this play.  You _could_ play elsewhere, thus retaining sente.  If white captures
K7, his capturing stone will be in ko.  So you'll recapture it.
Sente is more valuable at this point than protecting against
a minor ko like this one.];W[re];B[qd];W[oe];B[of];W[ll];B[js]
C[** zenjutsu:

Good.  This is a force-play which retains your sente (initiative).]
;W[is];B[ks];W[ir];B[ok];W[nk];B[nl];W[fi]

In my opening comments, I stated that go scores under standard
IGS scoring are composed by adding:

1. surrounded territory (not including stones on the board)
2. captured stones
3. the komi (for white)

Therefore, "giving free prisoners" to your opponent is the same
thing as giving them a free point.  Likewise, filling in your
own territory without reason is the same thing as subtracting
a point from yourself.  I'll be pointing out at least 13 end-game
stones that black played which either unnecessarily reduced black's
score by 1, or increased white's by 1.

This stone is a sample of a free prisoner.  It cannot capture
white alone.  White does not need to respond to it.  Therefore,
you just gave white a point.  _AND_ white now has sente (initiative)
to play wherever he chooses and try to make himself even more
points.

There are a few of these sorts of plays.... I'll keep a running
total from here to the end.

Total: 1];W[kh];B[lk];W[nr];B[nq];W[kk];B[bg];W[bf];B[ag]C[** zenjutsu:

This is another 'gift' to white.  This stone is not a force play.
It requires another stone to become a force play.  This means
that you end up giving white two prisoners (two points) in exchange
for white playing one stone inside his own territory (thus losing
a point).  White has a net gain of one point, PLUS white gains
sente.

them.];B[qg];W[rg];B[or]C[** zenjutsu:

As I said at the start of the review, you did very well.  Keep
on working, studying, and reviewing games to improve.  Observe
others, and ask lots of questions.  Play, play, play.  All are
keys to improving.

Also, I hear that having a 'mentor' helps learn the game too.
I say that I 'hear' this because I do not know anybody (other
than over the internet) who plays go.  ...anyway, I hear that
working with somebody face-to-face is very helpful.  If you have
such an opportunity, take it.  Whether you find a mentor or not,
The Go Teaching Ladder is a priceless learning resource-- take
advantage of it.

Last, I want to stress again that many of your plays were very
good-- better than most 30k I've seen.    Congratulations on your accomplishments, and best wishes on your
progress,

at 'a', 'b', or 'c'.  All will fail.]

Safe.])
(;W[dj];B[dk];W[ei];B[dj]C[** zenjutsu:

Safe.  You lose one point (D9 got filled), but you made use of
the sente white gave you by playing on the top.  The top play
cost white a point or two, and gave you a point or two.  Thus,
the net result is positive for black.])
(;W[dk]C[** zenjutsu:

Still not a threat.  Ignore it.];B[ka]TR[dj]C[** zenjutsu:

Now white can _try_ to continue the attack.  Note, white cannot
play at the triangle point because it would be self-capture.]

Safe.])))

_IF_ white ignores your previous play, then...];B[do]C[** zenjutsu:

Bang!  White loses group.

_IF_ white makes error of trying to save C6 group via escaping
out...];W[dn];B[eo]C[** zenjutsu:

Bang!  White loses group PLUS E6.  Ouch.

Anyway, you get the point.  Your D8 play was a force play.  Good
choice.]))

Now, you could continue to play force moves (moves which _require_
an opponent's response) and retain sente, or play the F19 stone.
Regardless, your board position is much better... and white had
very little say in this result.  White's plays were 'must do'
plays.]))
(;B[jm];W[in]C[** zenjutsu:

You just cost a point or white's, and white _had_ to respond
(or else lose more).  Also, you can still (if you want) play
L8.  ...however I still think other plays are stronger than L8
at this point.

...such as L2....];B[kr]C[** zenjutsu:

Ouch.  White just lost a TON of points on the bottom.

Let's look at white's attempt to block now...]

White's K14 group cannot survive.  Black's L11 group will survive,
and create a dangerous finger poking into the center-- white
will lose a lot of points.]))
(;B[gh];W[nn]C[** zenjutsu:

The bottom right is severly deflated for black.  White has also
gained the potential for points in the bottom-right of center.
I think this result is much better for white.  Your play in game
was a good decision.]))
(;B[dm]C[** zenjutsu:

White must respond, or lose the C5 group (because D5 would kill).]
;W[do]SQ[gk][gl][fk][fl][no][nm][nl]C[** zenjutsu:

Now black can go back to playing the right side, or extend the
left invasion.  At this point, I prefer the right side.  The
invasion on the left is _very_ strong now, and white will gain
nearly nothing in the center.]))
(;B[qd];W[pe];B[oe];W[qe];B[qf];W[re];B[od]C[** zenjutsu:

Still safe.]))
(;B[lq]C[** zenjutsu:

White cannot afford to ignore this stone, or else you might capture
the entire bottom area.];W[gq]C[** zenjutsu:

White could also play somewhere around this stone.  I'm not being
too picky about white's play... just illustrating the general
idea.  However, if white ignores your M3 stone, then he might
be in trouble.];B[cl]C[** zenjutsu:

Now you have a gigantic enclosure on the bottom-right, and an
invasion on the left side.]))
(;B[qb]C[** zenjutsu:

Now white's top group must fight to make life, or run for the
center.  Either way, your top stone will live because it can
make eyes to the top-left, or run to center.]))
(;B[qp]C[** zenjutsu:

A small-knight corner enclosure.])
(;B[po]C[** zenjutsu:

Perhaps a bit too far from enclosing the corner.  Observe a potential
white invasion (should white decide to invade immediately)...]
;W[qq]C[** zenjutsu:

Now white has a foothold in the corner.  If black tries to enclose
the group, it will likely escape out the top or diagonally to
the center... or just make two eyes in the corner.  Very dangerous.
I'd probably NOT advise playing Q5.  For detailed descriptions
of fuseki, check GoBase.org]))
