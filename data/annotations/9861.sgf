Lorl of the Stone : Its a good game, but I think the game could be fight more intensely then I would be in more trouble.

perhaps, but where ???
(LL)


FM: The game was quite peaceful, the only thing close to fight happened after the incorrect joseki in the center. Because of the peacefulness of the game it was decided by wrong tactical use of big points - there were several slow moves that didn't provide much benefits by both black and white (most important were moves 45 and 76, for example 39 was very slow too) and a few other clear mistakes too. I  think that seeing the urgentness and values of various peaceful moves is at least as important as sharp fighting skills so I hope you will still find my tips for this game useful. And by the way - always look for the 2x2 points in corner situations. Like black B18 now :-)]
