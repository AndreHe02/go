C[Hey, how's it going? To whoever reviews this game, there are a couple of things you should know:

While I do enjoy the game and indeed want to get stronger, a lot of my moves are played where I think they will make the game the most interesting.

I have a saying, you see, that "Memorable Games Breed Memorable Memories",and that is how I want to play while climbing the ladder in strength. After all, it's important to be strong, but even more important to have fun games. :D

About this game: Things got complicated extremely quickly. There were many points in the game, I'm sure, where I probably should have resigned. It wasn't so much that I'm an uncourteous player, but that the board was so complicated that I didn't actually realize the situation until near the end of the game! So I continued to play and lost by 28.5 points.

I'm not really sure exactly what I need to do, but three or four general threads of advice, mixed in with specifics should be enough for a great review. Thanks for reviewing. ;)

Hon: Hello! I am Bernd, HonFu in the ladder and on KGS, and I'm going to review this ... chaos! I was just looking this through and it is soooo messy! :)

First of all, I like your action style, it resembles my own. Since you don't play solid (boring) territory moves, your games, just as mine, get messy, but theres nothing wrong about it.

But I have one objection: If there IS a single, simple, clean move, which seals the matter, then this is the move you should play. When you're weak, you should defend, when your opponent is almost K.O., you should deliver the decisive blow, when there's an opportunity to claim a lot of points with one move, you should do so. 

If you don't, that is, if you miss the key points and play fancy, but random moves, then your games will be exciting and messy, alright, but they also won't make any sense.

See it like this: if both play perfectly, then the game will be close. But if you make one mistake, you lose. And if your opponent misses something, he loses. This is especially true in power go, as you play it - every move is dangerous and can be the decisive one, so what you need is precision. You must not leave out an important defensive move, and you must punish a mistake of your opponent hard and swiftly!

I will look this through and tell you, where you missed those important opportunities. I think, this is very important for you, seeing those crucial (and sometimes quite easy) spots. In the process I will give you general principles, which you can apply in your games.

At the end of the review, I will summarize where you go wrong generally in your thinking, and give you some general advice, about how to change that and improve your go.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[pd]C[I am white.

I don't usually play the high opening like this, but what the heck.]
;B[nq];W[fq]C[What are your thoughts on this move, strategically speaking? I'm not sure if it's ever happened in any proffessional matches or what it's strategic advantages and drawbacks are.

I think it's slightly bad for white, because black will almost instantly extend to attack my lone white stone. But I'm sure that's not all there is to the possibilities.

Hon: I also tried this. I didn't want to make the game so easy for black by giving him an early moyo, just what he wants. I think most pros would defend around R6, but at least from my 1k view, this seems playable. Q4 may be attacked, but even if pincered, he can still run. So why not pay back the attack with one of your own against the D4 stone? 

On the other hand, I myself have trouble winning the games I play this way. ^_Â°]

(;B[jq]C[Here, I was surprised by black playing K3. I was thinking he'd play around H3, to put more pressure on my lone white stone.

As it is, my white stone isn't really threatened, so I'm free to make a sente move!

Hon: Black is indecisive - attack or defend? K3 is a soft pincer, and also still leaves M3 open, I also don't like it.]
;W[cn];B[fp]C[Is this a good move for black? I think if K3 was at H3 it would be a splended move, but all it does here is touch my white stone.

Hon: Hm, joseki science, enigmatic, isn't it? Theory would tell us to attach at the stronger stone, which would be C6 (more open space). On the other hand, K3, since it's low, would not be much of an attack against F3 later, so maybe it also isn't too good to attach at D6 and make white strong for nothing. I would probably just play E5. 

I have seen stronger players play F4 kind of moves though.]

(;W[eq]C[I regret making this move. It's much too slow. But I'm not sure about where the best move would be. It's still early in the game, though. So no worries.

Hon: Yes, this is not good. You just get pressed low and make him strong. This early you don't want territory, especially not if you have weakish stones on the outside! 

Standard move would be G4 (see variation).

# Principle 1: Don't take territory in the opening! #];B[ep]
;W[gp];B[go]
(;W[gq]C[Not here!]
(;B[en]C[Why did black move here?

Hon: Because he was too drunk to see, that the cut doesn't work.]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[Hon: Black's move weakens both sides, the lone stone and your corner. You should find a way which helps both.]

(;W[dl]C[Hon: Not good. Black has an attacking force at D16 and a strong wall.]
;B[cj]C[Hon: He immediately attacks and makes use of his wall and hoshi.]
;W[fo]C[Ok. Here's what I was thinking: This white stone is a throwaway stone. Black should play f6 and it's dead. Then I would play H5, which is what I really wanted to do, but now it would be in sente.

I know how he reacted, but would a stronger player react to F5 in a similiar way?

Hon: No. Your F5 move is a present.]
(;B[fm]C[He obviously didn't do anything like I expected. I decided that maybe I could separate G5 from the E4 group and capture it whole. I read quite deeply into it, and it seemed like it could work, but alas, I couldn't read deeply enough.

Hon: Okay. Probably the misclick of a drunk player. Or maybe he didn't like to give you a peep there, if he nets you like in the variation. But that would be alright for him.

Your idea should not be to capture G5 (2 points) but to hunt and torment all his stones here!]
;W[gn]C[Hon: This move is logical, but too early. You got a weak group at C6, and the corner also seems too badly shaped to attack hard right now.]
;B[ho];W[fn];B[dm]
(;W[eo]C[Hon: Very good! If you had connected, he would have too, and all you would get would be two weak groups. The perfect place to tenuki!]

(;B[cm]C[he's just letting me connect? I doubt a stronger player would allow that.

Hon: Depends. If he reads, that even if he tries to connect, it won't really work for him, then he better makes you capture 4 stones for only 8 points (medium endgame move), while he builds some new thickness on the outside. So if there is no other option, a strong player would play it and be not too unhappy. 

Better of course not to die here, and it was not really necessary (see variation from the former move).]

(;W[do]C[here's where I began reading deeply.

Hon: Did you read out blacks answer B6 and saw that you could kill? Then this move was correct. If not, there are other, more forceful variations.]
;B[bn];W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B[ao];W[hn];B[el];W[bm];B[an]
(;W[am]C[I thought I had it in the bag. But I realized too late that while the C5 group had enough liberties, the B7 group only had two. I could have extended, except for the C10 stone, which completely crippled white's chances of running. This was the first major blunder of the game. :D

Hon: You don't have to escape after your extension though. You just need a few more liberties to kill.]
;B[ap]
(;W[ip]C[Hon: Mistake.]
(;B[jp];W[io]C[Hon: He helped you. Of course he has tidy shape, also not bad.]
;B[qn];W[oo];B[qk];W[lq]C[Shabbaaam!!!

What do you think are the strategic advantages and disadvantages of this move? In particular, how would two stronger players play out this situation?

I will say that I find this position fascinating. There's no telling what could happen, and I'm sure there's a lot of variations. Take your time to put as many variations as you can. I really want to see the depth of this position. :D

Hon: I think, actually there are not too many variations which make sense. First of all, I like your fighty instinct here. You didnt just want to creep out of the corner, but look for ways to fight back as offensively as possible.

First two considerations: Invade only when you're strong in the surroundings. But he is the one being strong here, having two well shaped groups of 5 stones to your one group of 2 stones with no clear base. You are on enemy ground, so you should think about settling quickly! 

Black's shape is connected. "Extend 3 from 2", which he did, gives him a shape which you can't cut (normally) with your invasion.

But: he HAS to react now, cover you in one way or another, and this you can use to make him drive you out into the center. So your invasion can serve as a sabaki technique (sabaki means settling quickly, one of the harder techniques in go).]

(;B[mp]
(;W[lp]C[Hon: Dangerous. 

# Principle 5: Don't start family feuds!#

With this move your M group hurts the P group, so your stones are fighting each other. Don't play moves which do harm to your stones in other places! Make your stones cooperate!]

(;B[lo]C[Hon: But this move shows that he wants to save every single stone. Beer makes you greedy!]
;W[ko];B[kp];W[mo]C[Hon: Perfect for you.];B[ln]C[Hon: Now take a good look at this whole area. If you had to decide, what kind of position you'd like to have here, what would it be?

Black is strong around, so you should settle quickly. And he just gave you a perfect opportunity to do so.]

(;W[jo];B[mn]C[oh, by the way, it turned out horribly for me. I realized that M4 was in a bit of a spot a little too late.

Hon: M4? You have already played it! Am I getting you wrong, or were there two drunk players?]
;W[no];B[lr];W[mq];B[np];W[mr];B[nr];W[kr];B[jr]
(;W[js];B[ls]
(;W[ir]C[at this point, I thought I had saved. I completely forgot about L3. >_<

Hon: Just what I meant. For your style of power go you need a sharp eye and a fierce punch. You need to be in good shape!]
;B[ms];W[jc]C[A fresh start was needed. I made a royal muddle of things down south.

Hon: But what about your stones in the lower right?

Because you were not ready to sacrifice two stones to settle in the corner, you lost not only them, but also have got a very weak group there.]

(;B[qf];W[nc];B[of]
(;W[qh]C[I invaded because I was behind by a lot. And those who are behind need complexity if they're going to win. But I can see how it's a pretty dangerous.

Hon: The problem is, how can you come back into the game if you just give him more targets to attack? You should go at his weak spots or see, how much you can reduce his areas.]
;B[pi];W[rj];B[qi];W[ri];B[rg];W[qj];B[pj];W[pk];B[rk];W[ql]
;B[pl];W[ok];B[rl];W[rh];B[ni]C[I envy black. always one step ahead of me. 

Hon: No wonder. You invaded, where he had strong shapes!

XD however, this allowed white to escape.

Hon: Maybe so, but what's with your lower right stones?];W[ph]
;B[nj];W[og];B[nf];W[qg];B[qe];W[rf];B[sg]C[Hon: Fruitless.]
;W[sh];B[re];W[se];B[sj];W[rd];B[qd];W[rc];B[qc];W[rb];B[qb]
;W[ra]
(;B[lc]C[Can you imagine a move any more crazy? this wasn't meant to be a smooth game... not by a long shot.

Hon: This is a natural move. Since black has poked through at R16, whites upper side group is extremely weak now. If the two stones die, black has points and solidity.]
;W[fc]C[I decided I need a bit of calm amid the stormy waters, so instead of attacking in blacks territory, I decided to extend. But O17 is in real danager.

Hon: you are behind, so you're right playing swift. Although you're losing. 

Do you know how to evaluate this? Actually it's not very hard. First you count the territory you really have. Would be around 20 for you. Then you count what your opponent has. Black also has around 20.

Then you try to evaluate the remaining potential. You got several very weak groups (O17, Q4), and the largest open space, the left side, is likely to give many points to black. So we can say, that if you don't find something miraculous, you are already way behind and on the road to defeat!]

(;B[kd]C[I actually expected him to attack my white group. Maybe he was so strong there that he could afford to extend.

Hon: While leaving his corner open and giving you a chance to fight back.]
;W[dc]C[Hon: No!

# Principle 9: Never touch the prey! #

D16 can be pincered. By touching him you make him stronger. Only touch enemy stones when you need to make eyeshape NOW. But in this situation you are still flexible. Since he played a slow move at L16, you should play tempo and double pincer.]
;B[cc];W[kc]C[Hon: Looks like a crude move ...]
(;B[lb];W[ld];B[md];W[le];B[mc]C[Now this was nice. I managed to sort of get a good position for one(though, compared to black it's horrible.) Let's see where it leads me.]
;W[je];B[ec]
(;W[db]C[Hon: Don' t try to rescue every stone!];B[ed];W[eb]
;B[hc]C[Hon: On first glance this looks like an overplay, but you seem to have no great way of containing him.]
;W[cd]C[he doesn't defend the corner. I take advantage.];B[ce]
;W[bd];B[be];W[bc]C[Hon: But this sequence is also good for him, because he can build up the left side.

Now we can already see, how the potential analysis of earlier leads to fitting results. One of your weak groups (O17) has died, black got large potential on the left side. What did you get? A small territory in the corner and a fresh weak group.]
;B[id]C[Hon: Beer makes hungry, he really wants to eat you now.]
;W[jd];B[fd]
(;W[ic]C[Hon: Not good. Look before you leap!]
(;B[ie]C[Hon: Black always does not connect. I wonder why?]

(;W[hd];B[if]
(;W[gc];B[hb];W[gd];B[ia]C[Hon: After this monkey jump connection it is obvious that you missed your chance. Now you have to find another eye - bad.]

(;W[de]C[Hon: I'm worried about your top group.];B[ef]C[Hon: Nice tesuji!]
;W[df];B[dg];W[jf];B[kf]C[Hon: He left a weak point. Don't just connect now.

# Principle 11: Force, then defend! #]
(;W[ke];B[ih];W[kg];B[lf];W[ig];B[hg];W[jg];B[hf]C[At this point, the game is too complex for me to comment on. I had a reason for every move, but I can't quite recall just what happened after this. It got really screwed up, so I'll sign off here with a few choice words:

first, please try your best to critique the rest. I know it'll be difficult. It's difficult even for me to explain what was going on! but I'll be greatly appreciative if you manage to do it.

I really benefit a lot in my studies if the reviewer is able to find general patterns in my game of what I'm doing wrong, and is able to supply general advice for correcting it, much more than when a reviewer simply points out weak moves. Please try your best to do that, I'd really appreciate it.

Thank you for the review. :\];W[mf

Hon: Okay, I'll try my best to find principles - they help me most too!

First what we need to do is a positional analysis - counting the score. This will make the seemingly crazy position a quite comprehendable one.

White has 9 in the upper right, about the same in the upper left, and around 15 (if you play your forcing moves in the lower left. Plus komi if there were one, around 40 points. Black has 20 points and maybe more on the left side, 10 on the top right, and around 50 or 60 in the lower right, if you don't find a way to cheat yourself out. 

So what you'd need to do now is make a plan about how to catch up. Rescuing the lower right is essential. If we imagine you live, black loses 30 points there. Still you are behind then, so you'd have to play a formidable endgame. Also the left can become very large if you don't watch out, you'll have to play a move around G10 and get away with it. Maybe that is even not deep enough. Landing a surprise blow, like pulling out O17 by some super tesuji, might be worth considering (If you see one - I do not ^_Â°).

Problem - even if you find a way to do all this, you can't do it all at the same moment! All in all this is an absolutely hopeless position. Also, if you look around the board, you have made real territory in no place. Then, losing the complete lower right to black was just too big. But lets see what happens!]
;W[mf];B[lg]C[Hon: Now the only strategy you can follow is making a second eye for this group. If you die, the game is even overer than now.]
;W[mg];B[lh];W[me]C[Hon: Tricky. ^^];B[nd];W[ng];B[hl]C[Hon: Okay, you just played some pushing endgame, still got no eye. Furthermore he got sente and took a really large point. He could have played S4 too and kill off those stones cleanly. Or cut at N14 and start the death hunt there. But it doesn't really matter.

Already he has claimed one of the areas outlined earlier in our strategy, and the left side is lost to you.]

;W[fg];B[fh];W[mh];B[li];W[mi]C[Hon: In this whole pushing you gamble with the life of your top group. If I were black, I would look for a way to cut and annihilate.

;B[rp]C[Hon: All this pushing, ignoring life, death and territory, missed the outlined crucial spots completely. You allowed him to play H8, which was super big, then you put your top group into a half dead state, and finally, when it was too late, you try to live with the bottom right group.

[cf][df][bg][cg][dh][eh][am][bm][jm][lp][lq][mq][mr]C[Hon: My SGF editor shows the top black group is dead, so there must be a white move at N14. Why is it not there? When was it played? If a stone was there, then maybe some of my comments don't fit. Also the strange black pass ... something must be wrong with the file. Well, the man line should be still the same.

So this was the game. In the review I tried to find as many general "proverb" principles as possible. Now let's see if I can put a spotlight on your weaknesses, so you can improve.

First of all you are a tactics and technic player, a power gamer who cuts before he thinks. I like it a lot but TACTICS MUST SERVE STRATEGY! There were a lot of situations where you could have profited if you thought before what exactly you want to accomplish. When you are in a game, before you move, don't look at any special spot, but at the whole area, better at the whole board, and think about what is important now. 

Which area is biggest? Is there a weak group that has to be saved now? Are there weak enemy stones that can be attacked? And how can I attack them while making some profit? Even the prettiest tesuji is poisonous if it doesn't fit into a strategical plan! 

And when you found a plan, THEN you look at all the cuts, hanes and whatever, and find the sequence which suits your goal best. A good example is the sacrifice I showed you in the lower right. First you think: Okay, I got to settle quickly, so how to do? Then you find the sequence and play it. Every move or sequence you play should be like this, having a very clear aim: taking solid territory, building strong influence, getting overall solidity.If you do this, you can improve your cutthroat style a lot. 

A good read for you would be Cho Chikuns "Positional Judgement", so that you learn to always see clearly how the game stands and what is important next.

But that is not enough. If you want to go on playing power go like this, you need to develop a punch. Now and then your go is sloppy, like you are a boxer with a beer belly: You miss important liberties, you don't see a net when it's there, you don't build a second eye when you really should. In short: You're not in shape and need workout!

I recommend you two great workout books:

Richard Bozulich: "One Thousand and One Life and Death Problems."

Richard Bozulich: "Get Strong at Tesuji."

Get those two and work with them every day, until you finished both books five times. The problems in there are not too hard for you, but there are MANY in it. Eventually you will be in great shape and your play will have a sting!]

Getting out is very important, because if you get surrounded, your stones lose every potential, while the opponent gets influence. Maybe you even die. Think twice before allowing the opponent to surround you!
