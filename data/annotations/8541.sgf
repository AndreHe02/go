This should also live... not sure what happened.  He would have to play at O9 to kill, but that's a suicide move since you can just take with P9.  P9 and O9 are miai... reflection points.  If he plays in one, you play at the other and live.]

But I didn't really count the points...do you know a easy method to count ?

The books I have read suggest "rough estimation" of points, and counting pairs at a time.  So 2...4...6....  Count one area at a time.

Personally I go from top left to top right to bottom left to bottom right (like reading).  You seem to be up about 10 points at this point.]

Yes he even says play P10 and you live.  :)

Do life and death problems!  Best way to get better around 15 kyu.  Play more aggressively and look for BIGGER points to play.  You both played way too small in middle to end game.  Try to look for huge points and light invasions.

Hope I helped!
