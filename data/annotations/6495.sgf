AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hello.  I played as white.

I would learn how to play better in handicap games.  Thanks.]
;W[np]C[Review by John Rae BGS 3kyu                Generally white starts well, in fact I think takes the elad in the middle game. however neglects to keep a key group alive. The whole game turns on a ladder capture - which is played through to long and so destroys a good white position.]
;B[pn];W[pq];B[qq];W[oq];B[qr];W[kq];B[pr];W[fq]C[JR:  I think I'd have left the lower side. White has a group that's pretty safe, take the opportunity to split black's stones apart somewhere else]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[eq]
(;W[gq]C[JR: The trouble with this sequence is that black seems to have solidified as much territory as white and if anything improved outward influence. I certainly don't feel white has started to catch up the handicap stones to any extent]
;B[fo]C[JR: After this sequence black has a strong position and white's position on the bottom is mostly third line. Black can keep it down fairly easily.]
;W[cm]C[JR: Jumping in here befroe black gets too strong is the right idea. Whit'e ideas is to split black into separate groups and attack them, not necessarily to kill but to reduce them.]

(;B[cp]C[JR: Black lets you off here I think];W[cf];B[df]
(;W[ce];B[cd];W[de]C[JR: Pushing through the gap is natural, , black really should not let this happen]
;B[ee]
(;W[ef];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[ch];B[ff];W[di];B[eg]
(;W[em]TR[ed]C[JR: Well white has established the side nicely. Black has a lot of space on the top that will cause problems. both sides  ignored the weakness of the marked cut.   I think white might have taken sent here instead.]
;B[ci];W[cj]C[JR: Black's descent is good general policy but doesn't get anywhere here. The alternative would have given more outside strength.]

(;B[bi];W[dj];B[bd];W[bj];B[ei]C[JR Black's move is not sente so white correctly takes sente to reduce the moyo. Good.]
;W[nc];B[ej];W[jd]C[JR: Good, black's move again was not sente. White has had two very good moves in a row and significantly reduced black's potential.]
;B[dk]
(;W[ek];B[el];W[fk];B[dl];W[fl];B[dm];W[dn]
(;B[oc]C[JR: Black missed a chance. and I think this would have been better at Q17 since this way still leaves the 3-3 invasion for white.]
;W[fn]C[JR: Necessary for the side. Not sure white can afford to take the time to do ti though.  Perhaps it is worth risking that black will not spot it not since he didn't before.]

(;B[qc]C[JR: The thing about handicap is you expect your opponenet to make slips to let you catch up. This is one of them.]
;W[gc]C[JR:  Its good because black replies to it but in general terms it leaves a few weaknesses on the top for white.]

(;B[ec];W[nd]C[JR: Good. White is well established on the top]
;B[oe];W[qi];B[ne];W[me];B[qg];W[ql]C[JR: Good, white is established on this side as well.    Black has all 4 corners  White has some good side territory. The position is good. I'd possibly count white as ahead]

;W[mn];B[ol];W[pm];B[pk];W[qk];B[qj]C[JR: You can't aford to miss the ladder until so late. Its not just the capture is so much bigger its the fact white loses the postion on the side as well. This is a 30+ point swing in the game]
;W[nl];B[rk]
(;W[gn]C[JR: Its hard if you lose a group like that when giving a handicap.  The huge extra potential black has from the whole side is the big problem.   R11 looks dead but ideally white wants to pull it out to minimise the loss due to that ladder.]

(;B[jg];W[mf]C[JR: Good, you don't want white taking that point.]
;B[nf]
(;W[he]C[JR: This move is of little worth. White is a long way behind. solidifying territory will not help, so either resign or find something to attack. its all or nothing time.]
