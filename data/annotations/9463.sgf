 TNISHIUCHI 16k+: Hi!
 Euren 17k?: 77 Hello



This game left me feeling terrible. I thought I was playing fairly in the opening and midgame but endgame turned out to be a disaster. I think that I am leaving a lot of weaknesses in my shape, and focusing a bit too much on attacking. My time management was also no good.

K- hi, ok let's take a look... (this is how I will tag my review comments)]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nq];B[qn];W[jp];B[hq]TR[jp]C[I suppose this was one space too far.

K- yes, but only because the white stone marked with a triangle is there; if that stone is not there, your extension is fine]
;W[fq];B[fp]LB[eq:A]C[K- depending on which way you want to defend, responding at A can be a good alternative (in this case it would protect the corner)]
;W[dq];B[cq]LB[cp:B][eq:A]C[E3 better?

K- any time you hane like this, you are inviting the cross-cut; sometimes that is what you want, but not here; I would say A and B are good options for you here, depending if you want to fight (A) or play safe (B)7]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[eq];B[do];W[gp];B[fo];W[gq];B[ho];W[hp];B[cf]
;W[iq];B[fc];W[hr];B[ee]LB[cc:A]C[K- you might have been better going into the corner (A) here, just to give your stones some strength]
;W[cc];B[bd]C[Trying to go for a kill since white space seems very limited.

K- even with 3 stones around the corner, you will not be able to kill white here unless he makes a mistake; better to play elsewhere for a better advantage]
;W[ec];B[eb]LB[fb:B][fd:A]C[K- hane again. inviting the cross-cut... might be ok if you already had a stone at A but you are weak here so better play at B to build some strength]
;W[db];B[fb];W[ed];B[bb];W[bc];B[ac];W[fd]C[K- this is the "problem" with trying to kill corner groups - if they can escape, they make things get very complicated because the fight gets into a much larger area; usually this means the group does manage to make life while messing up whatever area of potential territory you are trying to build! Often the best strategy is to use pressuring moves to wall them into a small space, so they make life but cannot escape.... you can even leave some attacking moves for later in case you need ko threats]
;B[gd]C[K- ok now you are going to have a difficult situation, because white has only 1 goal (to push outwards) while you have 2 (protect the left side, and protect the top side); so he can concentrate on his 1 task but you have to split your moves between 2, meaning it is harder for you than for him

this is why it is best to create a wall so that the corner group cannot escape, even if it makes life; or if you can't stop it escaping, force it to escape along an edge instead of into the middle - that way, you only need to defend in one direction]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[ff];B[gf];W[fg];B[ci];W[ab];B[aa]LB[fi:A]C[K- you can ignore the corner for now, so either (a) he will continue to play extra moves there (like he did in the bottom left) and you can build an advantage elsewhere, or (b) he follows you round the board and you can save the attacking moves in the corner for later

here for example, you could play at A, aiming to make territory on the left side]
;W[de];B[eg];W[ef];B[eh];W[gg];B[hg];W[gi]LB[nc:A][fj:B]TR[fb]
[fc][gd][ge][gf][hg]C[At this point I am wondering whether I should develop the topright, left, or try to pressure the white group

K- pressuing the white group is pretty pointless - it has escaped, you can't kill it, so play elsewhere; you have a large wall facing the top side (marked with triangles) so your best strategy is probably to use that, for example play at A

there is obviously a big gap on the left side, so if the opportunity arises you probably want to play near B too]
;B[fh];W[gh];B[fj]C[K- good, so you got that stone in place]
;W[ii];B[jh];W[ih];B[jg];W[ig];B[if];W[ji];B[lh]LB[pc:A]TR[if]
[jg][jh]C[K- these stones are looking good, now you just need to play to prevent an invasion underneath, say A]
;W[be];B[ae]LB[bf:A]TR[be]C[K- it may be painful but you need to sacrifice the corner stones; if you don't, the stone he has just played will be able to eat away your territory on the left side; playing at A would have been better here]
;W[cd];B[bf]C[K- good, you got this stone in anyway :)];W[ce]
;B[da];W[ca];B[cb];W[ea];B[ad];W[dc];B[qg]C[K- right idea but wrong place - it doesn't prevent an invasion in the corner]
;W[fa];B[ga]LB[gb:A]C[Left a nasty weakness

K- you mean the cut at A? yes you will need to protect that]
;W[da];B[af];W[df];B[dg];W[gb]
(;B[gc]C[K- ouch! I've put in a variation here which will limit the damage, but unfortunately there will definitely be some damage, that's unavoidable]
;W[hb];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb];W[hh];B[hf];W[dj];B[ej]LB[cg:A][go:B]
C[I chose to defend against the cut but I let white get some room to breathe. Maybe a play around D8 would have been better?

K- no I think you did fine, you defended against the "easy option" for white so now he has to work for his way out; unfortunately you have the cut at A and the push-and-cut at B, but even so you have enough strength around this area to make his life very difficult]
;W[dm]C[Did I];B[dk]LB[bk:A]C[K- best option here is to take away his eye space by  pushing in from outside; jumping in like this can actually turn into GIVING him eye space if you end up losing the stone; I think best play here would have been at A]
;W[ck];B[dl];W[cl];B[em];W[cn];B[bk];W[cj];B[bj];W[di];B[bl]
;W[bm];B[dh]LB[cg:B][ch:D][ci:C][cm:A]C[K- the last few moves you did were nice, pushing him and taking away his potential eye at A, but I'm afraid this move was a waste and risks putting him back in the driving seat; you have a cutting point at B and a weak stone at C, your best move would have been D to protect both]
;W[bi];B[ch];W[bh];B[ei]LB[bg:A]TR[bh][bi][bj][bk][bl]C[K- ok no this is not a good move I'm afraid, it achieves nothing; at this point, the key issue is about counting liberties : of the 2 groups I have marked, they both have 3 liberties, so in a capturing race the winner will be whoever plays first; if you lose these 3 black stones, white will live here, you cannot afford to let him play first - you should play at A immediately]
;W[bg];B[cg];W[cm];B[ai]C[K- good, you played into the capturing race first]
;W[al];B[ah];W[el];B[ek];W[en];B[fm];W[gl];B[fl];W[gn];B[fn]
;W[go];B[lj]C[K- yes, a good time to play elsewhere, but the biggest profit for you now is to protect the top right corner]
;W[in];B[jl];W[qc]C[K- ok, he got there first...];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[pa];B[oa];W[rb];B[hk]LB[jc:D]
[gj:B][hj:A][ij:C]C[I was trying to aim for the center white group

K- if that is your aim, this attack is not strong enough - he can play at A, then at either B or C to make the second eye, and you cannot stop him - you would need to play at A yourself

looking elsewhere, you have a weakness on the top side; if you play at D, you secure a lot of territory]
;W[ik];B[il];W[jk];B[kk];W[gk];B[hm]LB[fk:A]C[K- risky; if you play at A here, you have secured life for your group all along the left side; if he gets to play there first, you must fight for a second eye in the bottom left corner]
;W[hl];B[gm];W[gj];B[np];W[pq];B[oq]C[K- ah, so you tried out the move you didn't choose at the start of the battle in the lower left? good :)]
;W[or];B[op];W[qr];B[qq];W[pr];B[mq];W[nr];B[mr];W[qp];B[qo]
;W[rq]LB[jc:B][fk:A][kl:C][mp:D]C[A bit lost at this point. I seem to have a big region of potential territory but I can't see any way to push against white.

K- in that situation, look for weakness to protect; I already mentioned A and B, there's also C and D]
;B[pk];W[bq];B[bp];W[cr];B[cp];W[ar]LB[fk:A]C[While black seems to have the left, its actually quite vulnerable to threats. Should I take time to capture the three stones?

K- no, you just need to play at A, which gives you 1 eye, then later you can get the 2nd eye when you capture the 3 stones]
;B[kn];W[hn];B[kp];W[kq];B[kr];W[jr];B[lq];W[jq];B[jo];W[lp]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[mp];W[kp];B[jn];W[io];B[mn];W[ms];B[ls];W[ns]
;B[re];W[rd];B[rf];W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[bo];W[im];B[jm]C[At this point I feel as though we are at endgam and I'm further ahead.

K- yes, you are a LONG way ahead - white has a little territory in 3 of the corners, and a large living group (but no territory) extending from the top left corner; his group in the middle of the left side is dead; and you have the rest of the board....]
;W[fk]C[K- ....and then with just 1 move it all changes!];B[jj]
C[Turns out my wall is weak and I begin to struggle with the time.]
;W[ij];B[kj];W[ki];B[li];W[kh];B[kg];W[lg]C[Ouch

K- not really - just protect your cutting points, play solidly, don't let him make eyespace... he does not have an easy task here]
;B[kf];W[mg];B[nf]LB[of:B][pf:A]C[I'm thinking there is no way I can let white live in here. Maybe I should have pushed from the bottom since it seems bigger. There are also some cutting points in right wall

K- yes the cutting point at A is the most pressing thing here - you could play this stone at B to continue to make it hard for white]
;W[nh];B[ng];W[mh];B[oh];W[oi];B[nj]LB[ph:A][mj:C][nj:B]C[K- you chose this point because it's a vital point for eye space right? I think playing at A is more urgent because it removes a weak point you have; if white then played at either B or C, you could just play the one that he didn't]

 TNISHIUCHI 16k+: Hi!];W[mc];B[ra]C[Needed to take sente moves do I don't run out of time. What a disaster

K- ok so you've got time pressure, but actually white's group is very thick - he has no eye space at all, you are keeping him under pressure]

K- no, wasted move];B[oa];W[nb];B[rs];W[ie];B[tt];W[ke];C[Resigned.

K- we've all had games like this, where build up a strong position but just miss 1 key weakness and it all unravels! Look at move 248 - just one move that swung it between a big win for you and a demoralising (but smaller) loss

I know you said time pressure was a factor - I've found it a good strategy to try to stay level or ahead of your opponent during the early and middle game, so that when you get to the endgame you are either on a level or even have an advantage - so it can be worth rushing yourself gently earlier in the game to get this benefit later on]
