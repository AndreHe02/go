C[Hi dear reviewer,
I'm nocebo (white) and both I and my partner are interested in a comment.
We get the impression that white had possibilities that never transformed into points, there may be a big mistake in not invading the north moyo. I resigned after a 20k mistake at the very end, but I was already well behind.
Thank you in advance,
François

;W[pi]LB[pj:A]C[Az: This is playable, but A is more normal. The reason is that it helps the upper right (UR) but also develops from the lower right (LR) corner.]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[nq];W[lq]LB[jp:A][kp:B]
TR[ep][fp][fq]C[Az: First clear mistake. When black jumps out and presses down you the pincer stone, white will have to crawl towards a strong position. This makes the most of blacks position. Just defending the corner is ok, but if you want to pincer it should be something high so you can't get trapped easily.]

Az: Yup. The more conservative E9 is playable too I think. It's hard to think up a move this bad.]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[ek];W[dn];B[em];W[cj];B[ei]C[Az: White gains nothing and black is leading again. The attack actually made black stronger since it drove him in the direction he wanted to go anyway.]

(;W[nf]C[Az: If white wants to play this game he should play r17, the center is less important. Really though, white has more to lose than black does in this game of chicken since the right side is much more solid than the top, so white should swallow his pride and defend.]
;B[mf];W[me]C[Az: This doesn't make any sense, white does a ton of damage to his ability to reduce the top for nothing here.]

;W[go];B[rm]LB[rd:A][pr:B]C[Az: After this it looks like blacks game. I can't say that this was the reason for the defeat, but white should not have started playing chicken with the A-B exchange since he had more to lose as this shows. There are a ton of mistakes for both sides after this, but hopefully this is enough commentary to get you started. The game see-sawed back and forth as both sides made some big mistakes early on, then failed to capitalize on the other side's mistakes.]
