C[Hello Karin,

I am Chris Dams and I will review your game. In general I think you played too timidly. Wide extensions
were mostly not being played by either player. The strategy of "whenever possible, play the widest extension
anywhere to be found on the board" is something that you really should try out for some games just to see and
experience a different way of playing. At various points in the review I will point out where a wide extension could
have been played instead.

Good luck!
Chris

Thank you for reviewing.

It's my first game on igs.
I probably would have won, if I hadn't lost sente in the end. However, I think I should be about 3 kyu stronger than my opponent, so this result is dissapointing either way. I was way too defensive. Could you tell me, when and where I should have attacked? (Do you have an opinion about my style in generall?)

Thanks!];B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[nq]C[This actually IS the widest extension possible on the board, so very good!]

(;B[nr]C[This is not the standard more here, and for a reason not standard. See variation for what I would
have done with White. For the standard moves, see the variation of this move.]

(;W[or];B[no];W[pm];B[jp];W[gq]C[This is a premature invasion by White. A more logical move by White would have been on C6, which would be the
widest extension on the board for White. Your idea of attacking the white stone is also good, attacking is generally
what one does with premature invasions. You do so from the wrong side, though. In general, when there are two
sides to attack from one chooses the side where one is the weakest because that side is the one that can best use
some strengthening. So, E3 would be a logical move.];B[jr]C[As noted, this is the wrong side to attack from. If you are going to attack from this side, J3 would be more logical
because it gives you a bit more territory and the white stone less room.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[hr];B[eq];W[er]C[We see why the invasion by White is premature. White gets very little territory and Black gains more on the ouside.
About the two moves you are proposing, I would play neither, play an extension from your black stones instead.
Maybe this allows White to capture a stone, but I really like Blacks position better in the variation that I added.]

(;B[bp];W[ch];B[dl]C[This is really too close to your own strength. C9 extends a bit further. Also, a stone on the fourth line is
vulnerable from enemy stones trying to slide underneath it, as we see in Whites next move.]
;W[ck]C[This exposes Blacks weakness. Still, I do not like this move, it is on a rather small scale. O17 instead, which is
the widest extension on the board, would be thinking on a much bigger scale.]
;B[cl];W[bl];B[bm];W[al];B[dk];W[cj]C[Of the two moves you propose, I like c6, as you played in the game best. It gives White the fewest
possible chances to mess around.]
(;B[cn];W[go]
(;B[pg]C[This move is not good. The reaction by White points out why it is not. Stones on the fourth line always leave
open the possibility of sliding underneath them and that is a great thing for White because he is at the same
time extending from his own position.];W[qi]
(;B[pk]C[This is not a good move in most cases. When jumping between a stone on the third row and a stone on the
fourth row separated by three lines, this point is very often wrong. You see in the game why.  White gets a nice
territory on the rigth side. If you want to jump in beteween, see variations instead. Also read the book 'Attack
and Defense' which has a chapter on this specific invasion.]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[qj];B[pl];W[ql];B[om];W[pn];B[oo];W[po];B[rg]
C[This is a slow move and it does not even make territory as White demonstrates the next move. The widest
extension is F17 for Black.];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc]
;W[nb];B[mc];W[jj]C[Good move by White. Black has potential territory but hardly any actual territory to speak of. This move
goes quite a long way towards destroying Blacks prospects. I think I would have played it one space to the
right, though, to go a bit further inside the black area of influence.]

(;B[rc]C[This is not a good move. See my comment three moves ahead.]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[sb]C[I don't think White actually needs to add this stone to be alive, which explains why I called your move
S17 bad. It loses sente];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc]
(;W[bc]C[I think the variation is better for White.];B[bb];W[ac]
;B[ec];W[ic];B[ed]C[This move destoys your own possibilities on the left hand side. After Whites move you are never going to reduce
it anymore on D14. You could instead just have played your next move G17 instead.]
;W[df];B[gc];W[hb];B[gb];W[kb];B[mb];W[kd];B[me]C[This looks small compared to playing M10.]

(;B[nl]C[I understand that it looks a bit scary here, but slow moves like this are not going to help you if you are
behind.];W[kl]C[Review stops here. Black has pretty much lost at this point. The reason is that Black is playing many
moves that look rather slow and timid.];B[ef];W[kn];B[lo];W[ln]

have played o17 if I were White to answer this one, it is the widest extension on the board. For more interesting
things to happen, you could have approached the white position one point closer on r9. That way you threaten
to slide underneath his position in the corner, see variations. But still, I like f17 even better for Black because it
is the widest possible extension on the entire board.

what would happen here? I'm quite bad at such moves.])
(;B[qk]C[This is the more interesting move if you want to extend down this side. I show two variations, a logical
and peaceful one and one where White is attempting to do some insane stuff and fail miserably. There
really is not much to be afraid of when playing these kind of moves.]

(;W[qm];B[qh];W[nc]C[Maybe the most logical development from the play on r9. I am not entirely happy for Black, though, because
White has gotten the widest possible extension on the board. This is why I propose Black play his widest
possible extension on f17 instead of r9.])
