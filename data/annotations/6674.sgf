C[Dear reviewer,

Lately I have been struggling versus players of my own rank.  Although I made some obvious mistakes in this game, I am submitting it because I am very unsure of how to play from the first 20 moves onward.  My hope is that you can help me with developing overall board strategy based on my fuseki.  I may have won this game with better yose play, but because I understand my silly endgame mistakes, you can simply ignore them.  

Thank you kindly!

Hi!
I'm Attila Mondik, I will mark my comments with [m\].
In this game White played very low in the opening, but black failed to take advantage of this, letting white's invasion to live too easily, even make some thickness inside black's sphere of influence. Next, white attempt to kill black's reducing stone made the game quite even. Black's better yose led to his victory.]
;B[pp];W[qd]C[xiaorong [10k\]: hi gg];B[dp];W[dc];B[cg];W[ce]
C[Is this a bad move?  I wanted to enclose my corner, but perhaps moving out along the top of the board was better play.  Playing here seems small, considering that afterwards black sketches out some huge territory with B10.
[m\]: bC13 does not put much pressure on the corner, so you can tennuki, and play one of the big points on the board. Making shimari on the TR seems to be a good idea, or an aproaching move at R6. Note that B10 would be a wrong move: it is wrong idea to play such a low move in the very opening of the game.]
;B[cj]
(;W[cn]C[I feel behind in this fuseki, possibly because of C15, so I decided that I'm going to spoil Black's framework as best I can.  Is this an overplay, considering I cannot extend to C9 without touching a Black stone?
[m\]: it is not an overplay, "just" it is not the right direction, b's framework is very thin at the moment, no need to spoil it.]

(;B[gq]
(;W[ck]C[[m\]: I think this is wrong move: when you make contact moves, you strengthen the touched stones. Contact plays are for defense, but should be used only in emergencies, and that's not the case.]
;B[dj];W[dk];B[dm];W[cm];B[dn];W[bp];B[cq];W[oc]C[[m\]: good, but maybe first you should push once at E9, not to be shut in.]
;B[ic]
(;W[qm];B[mq]
(;W[qg]C[[m\]: okay, let's take a look on the table. You played 11 stones, and 10 of them are on the third line, or even lower. Playing so low is "safe", but your development is very slow. Especially, this move is to close to your shimari, so it is very unefficient.]
;B[lc];W[gc]C[[m\]: ...an another stone at the 3rd line..];B[qn]

(;W[rn]C[[m\]: an another, even lower.];B[qo];W[qj]C[[m\]. ... and an another. Don't expect to win with such low moves.]
;B[pm];W[ql];B[pl];W[jp]C[With this reducer, I feel I have caught up.
[m\]: this is not a reducing move but an invading one: a reducing one would be somewhere on the imaginary boundary of the b's moyo, somewhere near the line between D7-Q8.]

(;B[jr]C[[m\]: B was very kind to you.];W[jn]C[[m\]: good idea.]
;B[kp]C[[m\]: the proverb says: "don't touch what you are attacking". A capping play (K8) is still a good move for b.]
;W[ko];B[lp];W[ho];B[hp];W[ip];B[go];W[hn];B[iq];W[jq];B[ir]

(;W[kq]C[Too small... I know there are bigger points on the board, but where?
[m\]: yes, it is slow, just a few points.];B[lo];W[ln];B[mn]
;W[lm];B[nk]C[[m\]: good.];W[mm];B[nn]
(;W[nm]C[Probably too slow again?
[m\]: this move does nothing: because of O12 the wall you're making is without meaning.]
;B[me];W[gn];B[fo];W[qq]C[[m\]: good, if you can live with it. (but you couldn't).]

;B[ei];W[fi];B[fj];W[ek];B[fh];W[gi];B[dh]
(;W[ol]C[[m\]: what the purpose of this move?];B[jj]C[Now the lightbulb goes off... I have a -huge- wall facing the center of the board, and Black plays at Tengen, trying to reduce my territory and spoil the game.  Do I go right away for a kill, or do I try to strategically chase him away while making territory?  I played at K12 with bloodlust in mind.

[m\]: that's why making territory in center is hard: K10 has a lot of direcions to run out, it is hard (or impossible) to kill it. But it's a good target to attack. If you attack, try to profit from attacking even if you don't kill the target.]

(;W[jh];B[lj];W[lh]C[[m\]: K10 can be still connected with Q8, so your moves have meaning just if you make them to attack the upper black stones. But they are not an easy target neigther..]
;B[pk];W[ok];B[pj]
(;W[oj];B[oi];W[nj];B[mi]C[Already faltering, now my territory on the right side is severely weakened, and I seem a little too thin to catch black.  I'm worried that Black is going to live through all of this and ruin all my influence (which actually happened in the game)
[m\]: as I told, killing K10 is hard, so try try to make an exchange.]
;W[ni]C[[m\]: good];B[mh]
(;W[mg]C[[m\]: you are too weak on the right to attack now, and K12, M12 are thin also.]

(;W[jk]C[Great... Black has totally demolished his way into my influenced and spoiled nearly everything!!  What happened?

[m\]: you tried to kill something not for killing. The killing failed, and (!) you gained almost nothing during this fight. 
Trying to save some points in the middle doesn't look a very good idea, take a look at the another possibilities.]

[m\]: At that move (79) you were at a slighty better position. Black's move destoyed your strategy. This happens very often on the go board (the opponent wants to win too :) ), so you should be able to change your strategy during the game.
On the opening you played a lot of  slow and low moves. I think you should take a look at some professional game's openings, not for learning or imitating them, but to get a grip on how they think in this stage of game. 
Also, it is important to understand that attacking is not just about killing: almost always is enough to embarrass the opponent by attacking his weak stones, and make some profit while attacking them.
I hope that my comments helped impoving your strength, and if you have questions, please don't hesitate to mail me.]
