(;B[cb]C[try to avoid contact and fights in the fuseki]
(;W[hd]C[in this direction, white should play low (on the third line) because he is facing  black stones - he could also play further]

;B[nq]C[this area is not so big, better play on the widest area : the right side

plus, you need move than one move to threaten his small group so better wait to attack it]

(;W[fr]C[white is very nice once again, he could let the three stones to keep sente

also, he's not making a very nice shape];B[qq]

(;B[cf];W[bi];B[dg];W[cj]LB[jc:A][qk:B][op:C]C[here, A,B and C are examples of big moves for black, why loose sente with B13 ? this is a yose move!]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[bf];W[di]C[hopefully, white does apparently not want to have the sente...]
;B[jc]C[good];W[ic];B[jd];W[mc]C[that's the third time that white plays such an aggressive move

usually the best way to handle such moves is to try to surround it, so maybe you can kill him or at least let him live small (and gote) and develop power on the outside]

(;B[le];W[me];B[mf];W[ne]C[now it will be diffficult to confine him on the side...]

(;B[nf];W[ld];B[ke];W[kb]C[> I have tried to attack the white group, but finally he made alive successfully. Anything wrong with my moves?

as I said before, the first attacking move should have been N15, not M15]
;B[jb]C[at least, as a consequence of his abusive invasion, he is seriously damaging his top left territory]
;W[kc]
(;B[lb]C[it helps white];W[ka];B[ja];W[nb]
(;B[nd]C[too far];W[od];B[oe]C[at last];W[md];B[lc]C[useless, plus if white respond in L16 you create a cutting point in K15

(;W[mb]
(;B[oc]C[> Should I defense my corner on Q16?

yes of course, he should not be able to go out here

once again, VERY very often, the best option is to let the invader live small and in gote - don't try to kill at all prices, it often draws back at you]

(;B[pe];W[qd]
(;B[qc]C[the corner is too small to make live inside];W[rd]

(;B[rc]C[still the wrong direction... that's you who is going to live small whereas it was your corner, initially, wasn't it?

and will you even manage to live?  It is very small!];W[re]

(;W[nc]
(;B[kd]C[useless - white will escape];W[la];B[na]C[this move is also useless... white has escaped and the corner is not yet alive]

(;W[qf];B[of];W[qh];B[gc]C[by the way, you're still not alive in the corner

if you manage to kill all the white stones here it is bigger, but it is most likely that you won't get everything so I think it is bigger to save your corner (R19 should do)]
;W[fc]
(;B[hc];W[id]
(;B[ib];W[gd]C[you let white make good shape and connect - the center is still empty, it will be hard to capture him]

(;B[ni]C[watch your cutting points...]
(;W[pj]
(;B[qo]C[don't forget you still have three groups that are not yet stabilized - better try to stabilize them first

also, locally, I think a move like P4 would be better shape - the sequence will leave a weakness as we will see later]

(;B[dr];W[br];B[bs];W[ar]

the variation is only a suggestion];W[hh]C[at least you keep the sente, that's good]

;B[pi]C[I am not sure that there is a weakness here];W[qi];B[oi]

;B[rl];W[sm];B[nj]
(;W[ok]C[this shape is not efficient];B[nk];W[ol];B[kp]C[yes, this point is big, but it would still be bigger to save your upper right corner or to fix the weakness in the lower right]
;W[kg]C[good reaction from white];B[lf];W[ih];B[ji];W[ki]
(;B[kh]C[white has good shape here, better play defensively]
;W[jh];B[lh];W[kj];B[jg];W[jf]
(;B[kf]C[> J10 is more important.

that would make an empty triangle but yes, this area is bigger than L14

maybe the best shape is K9];W[ij]

;W[jk];B[jl];W[lk];B[kl];W[fp]C[white does not realize he is removing his own liberties]
;B[fo];W[go]C[and even without considering white's weakness, this move is abusive - black is too strong here]

not so dramatic - if white responds to this move, you can still drop the E18 stone

C[About the whole game: white showed an aggressive style, making early deep invasions that you did not handle very well. Especially at N17(move 50): you missed the opportunity to surround him and damaged your corner.

After the chuban, white is clearly ahead. He probably felt too confident and let many mistakes behind him, ignoring yours.

So you came back, but missed an opportunity in the south-west where you could reduce white territory significantly more.

The worse play for both players is what happened in the north-west corner. You should not have thought you could live here, and white should have been able to kill you.
