AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[vincent85 [15k?\]: hi

AR: To my esteemed reviewer, hello. I have changed the game information of this game to reflect my basic screenname and actual rank (though i may be one or two stones weaker now). As you can see, despite being five ranks stronger than my opponent I had taken a five stone handicap. In Go, I am quite strong at some things, but am disproportionately weak in one area - killing. What follows is a game that showcases this weakness to the fullest. I lose semeai after semeai; at times I even am winning them handily before suddenly having that victory wrested from me.

I'm hoping you'll have some good 'general' advice for me that I can bear in mind quite like the other proverbs or the few Joseki's that generally tide me over. I'm not looking for killing advice at a dan level or anything; but my killing skills are stuck at around 18k, and I would like to see that improve. Just so you know, I know the various Nakade shapes, am decent with a throw-in or snapback, and other 'life-shape-basics'.

Thank you in advance for your time. During the game, places where I see a mistake and what i could have done differently I left comments; and have also left some comments explaining my 'gneral direction of play'.

*** Hi, I am Jouni 4kyu in Finland.  I think the problem in this game is not of killing, but that you have the wrong target.  You overplay too much, making the opponent stronger.  I'll try to comment on these.  My comments will start with three asterisks.]

(;B[pn]LB[pk:C][qk:D][pl:A][ql:B][np:E][mq:G][nq:F]C[*** This is your first error.  When you have the advantage, as here, where white approaches your strength, avoid making white stronger.  Touching helps white more then you.

All the moves marked with letters are better.  Moves A-D make the place where white is cramped - and simultaneously target for making a moyo with the upper corner 4-4 stone and with the center stone.  Moves E-G defend in the corner, while white is still alone right next to your strength.]

(;W[qp]C[*** White is trying to get a fight straight away.  Now this is a possibility for you to get a good result. 

First: situational analysis: White wants the corner.  
Second: Deciding the course of action. Well - you have a lot of influence around - if you give the corner and make walls around, they work nicely with the other stones on the board...

[ao:B][co:A]C[AR: Made life - for my other groups. At this poitn i'm losing by a ton (in my estimation). That said, even if i'm losing by a ton, ther'es still half the board to fight for, and by threatening whites groups around D7 I should be able to try and build a wall around D10 - giving me a solid chunk of the top-left corner. Also - the O10 group is close to being cut off .. . and that's what i will pursue.

*** Ah.  Good to stop for a review.  To me it seems it is difficult to attack the white group A, as e.g. B is white's sente, if you come too close to the group, it can attack your stone while running towards the group on the right, and if you are too far away, it can make a base.  The three white stones C are stronger than D.  White E would make them superstrong, and that is an extremely good move for white.]
;W[gm]C[*** OK, so now white will have no problem at all on the left.]

[jd][pd][qe][nf][of][pf][cj][dj][jj][lj][ek][fk]C[AR: Now he's out - -  I guess my reasoning was that he's hopelessly cut off, surrounded by black walls (see marked) and i'm strong on all sides. [Squares = strong, circles = "hopefully get the chance to play here in sente, if not, then will just surrond by playing a bit out of that range"\]

;B[lb];W[nd];B[ne];W[kb]C[AR: Again, meant to play N18, but played too fast.

vincent85 [15k?\]: yep

AR: The result? Nothing big, just the loss of the M18 group, and his  13 stone not-yet-one-eyed dragon through the *middle* of my moyo LIVING [/sarcasm\]. Needless to say, this was bad for me.]
;B[rj];W[rl];B[ri]C[vengeance3 [20k?\]: i should resign];W[ql]
LB[hb:B][pn:A]SQ[dd][jd][jg][cj][dj][jj][ek][fk]C[vengeance3 [20k?\]: you have an enormous corner
vengeance3 [20k?\]: my center moyo is ruined . . . by my mistakes rather than your strength
vengeance3 [20k?\]: and i have major poitns . . . nowhere

AR: Here you can see I sort of 'summed up' my feelings on the matter of how the game was going. The reason I didn't resign  was that I was secretly harboring the hope that I could - magically - preserve a full quarter of the board. I did have quite a moyo going.

*** Well, in this situation, white can get by with not much reduction of the upper left corner...  Even with black stronger on the right side now, white can grab the A group, and  white can get in the moyo by B]

(;B[pk]
(;W[nb];B[od];W[pb]C[AR: At this point, i'm still not doing so bad. A play at S17 would secure quite a respectable right-side of the board for me. . . the captures of the Q12 group was something of a given . . . until.]

C[AR: And at this point I die. No matter what grouop i protect, some group will certainly be dying here. . . K14 may be the strongest play, I don't even know honestly.

*** I would not be so pessimistic.  But connecting is essential.]

(;B[gf];W[gg];B[ih];W[ef];B[de]C[AR: I don't know, and didn't have time to read it out, but this seemed to threaten killing the C10 group - - which i could not afford. . . otherwise connecting to K14 here would be perfect, since either J15 or K11 gives me 2 eyes.

*** Connecting at K14 only gives one eye.  For K11, the other one is false.]

(;W[jf];B[fd];W[gd]C[vengeance3 [20k?\]: i 4tg4tg4tg4tg4tg4tz
vincent85 [15k?\]: good game
vengeance3 [20k?\]: No Not a good game - quite a terrible game. Thank you though.

AR: And that's where the game ended. As I alluded to at the beginning, I'm decent enough (for my level) at building moyos, at profiting while chasing a weaker group, and at nakade's and shapes for life and death. But the biggest axe in my progress right now is killing groups and a seeming inability to do so. Here I lost to someone five ranks weaker than me with a five stone handicap. . . . that's just embarassing. What I'm asking for is - is there some sort of systemic or consistent overarching error that I'm making? When somebody taught me the proverb: "Extend from a crosscut" my play got better. When someone taught me, "Avoid empty triangles" or "A ripped knight's jump is bad shape for you and good for your opponenet" My play style and rank improved. When I was told "Avoid contact plays" Again, I grew.

So now I want to ask - what should I keep in mind when my opponent plays a move like D13? Or how should I prevent a move like O13 from turning from a dragon into a living group? General and specific advice would be very useful. As I pointed out by my comments, I can see the 'killing' moves and - for each of the three or four main fights in this game - a way i might ahve avoided dying. But I would like to see to it that I don't continue to make these mistakes while playing and then discovering them afterwards. Thank you very much in advance for the time and effort - i really appreaciate it.

*** 
Now, the general advice:  Play strong moves.  Avoid cutting points.  When you are stronger, DON'T TOUCH! (as someone has taught you before :).  

In this game, you attack all the time with weak groups.  Only attack when your group is stronger than your opponents.  Try to value influence and power, so that you collect some gradually.  E.g. let your opponent live to get walls or a ponnuki.  When you have a strong position, only then you can attack - and when attacking, DON'T TOUCH!

Don't try to kill.  It kills you.

You tell you are good at chasing weaker groups for profit.  Do it!  Trying desperately to kill is the way of the weak player.  This game is not about killing.

For killing training, there are the life and death exercises.  I recommend the Cho's elementary set from http://tsumego.tasuki.org/?page=tsumego

Then only kill if you see that something is killable, and that there are no bigger moves on the board.

I hope these comments are useful, although they are different than what you actually asked.]
