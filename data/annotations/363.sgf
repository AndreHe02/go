(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]AB[pd][dp]C[Thanks for sending me this game.  I have marked key spots with the "sun" sign, as shown above.

You lost this game because you didn't pay attention to the whole board.  In particular, you picked fights where you were weaker than white.  That's a no-win situation even in an even game.  In a handicap game it's a sure way to lose.

Remember,  defending makes you thick.  Attacking makes you thin.  White defended so much that he became overwhelmingly thick.]

;B[fc];W[ck];B[cm];W[ek];B[nq];W[co]C[w13 is not a good move.  You should just let w link up and build up on the other side.

black a is not good shape.]
(;B[dn]C[w can play b.]
(;W[cp];B[dq];W[cq];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[lq];B[no];W[iq]C[This is a big turning point.  White always wants to build thickness in handicap games.  If you play b you seal him in.  Also, it's very big.

A isn't that big, and weakens black on the outside.]HO[1]
(;B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[po]C[In general, a "weak" group between two other weak groups is actually strong, because each of its moves affects _both_ the nearby enemy groups.

That's the situation here.  Each white play affects both black groups.  There is no way for black to come out ahead here.

For instance, black a strengthens the corner group, but the answering white moves severely damage the outside black group.]

[pq][or][nr][mr][lr][lq][lp][lo]C[I have the feeling you are not paying much attention to the whole board here.

There is no need to fight this much.  Look at the area marked off by the x's.  white has 7 stones, black has 2 or 3.  Therefore, you can't expect much here.

I would play b...]
(;B[oq];W[np];B[mq];W[mp];B[mr];W[lr];B[ns];W[mo]MA[nr][or]C[Yes, black has captured the x stones, but now white is extremely strong on the outside.  This is exactly what white wants!

a is small and gote.  white is now much thicker than before, so your lower left group is much weaker.  I would want to play something like b or c.  Notice how much this area swelled up for white later.]
HO[1]
(;B[pn];W[em];B[fn];W[dm]C[A is "only" a huge endgame play because it doesn't immediately threaten either white group and only gives black a half eye in gote.

I'm not sure it's absolutely essential to answer white 47 at a.  You could consider either b or c.]

(;B[cn];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]C[a is very small.  Stay away from strength!

b would clearly be bigger.]HO[1]
(;B[qk];W[lc];B[rc];W[qd]C[b is at least reverse sente, and would help to push white down.

a isn't bad, though.]
(;B[jd];W[le]C[Why play where white is strong?   Looking at the whole board we see that white is strong everywhere except his invasion stones, so white can easily run away.  On the other hand, black's group is weak in the midst of white's strong groups, a much heavier burden.

Black a is also bad because it is a defensive kind of move (It strengthens both sides.)  What are you defending here?

I might play b, reducing the center, but c is also good.]HO[1]
(;B[qg];W[rg];B[rf];W[re];B[rh];W[sf];B[qh];W[pe]C[w67 is very big now.  white is now alive on the side, and white can now connect to the invation stones.]
;B[oc]C[white is already alive, so this "attack" has been at most worth some territory.

This is a bad exchange for black, because now white is even thicker.];W
[oe];B[mc];W[ld];B[pi]C[If I were white I might ignore b72 and start to think about pressuring the weak black group with something like b.  Locally, white b might be better.]

;W[jb]MA[lc][ld][le]C[You should never play a unless you are going to cut immediately.  It's very bad shape, as you found out.

Let's look at the whole board.  w is now very strong everywhere.  The x stones can either make eyes in place or run to the right.  In any event, w is much stronger here than black.  Don't fight where you are weak!

This is a hard game for black.  b or c or d come to mind.]HO[1]
(;B[kc];W[kb];B[mb]C[white b might be even better.]
(;W[ic];B[id];W[hd];B[jf];W[he];B[lb]C[Oops.];W[kd];B[if];W[jc]MA[cf][dg]
[de][he][hd][ic][jb][kb][lc][ld][kd][le]C[Black has just made all the x stones very strong.  Therefore, a is the last place black should play. Black a is not so much an invasion as suicide.

Black already has two fairly weak groups.  Creating another weak group is foolhardy.

I'd play something like b.]HO[1]
(;B[ch];W[bg];B[ei];W[eh]C[You can't play a because white is so strong that the cut works immediately.]
;B[fh];W[fi]MA[ei]C[black a removes all the potential from x.  Just play something like b and hope to get something from x later.

Alas, you can't play c now because that would hurt the black stones at the top.]

(;B[gi];W[fj]C[Black has immediately given up his "invasion" stones with no compensation.]
;B[ii];W[fg]MA[fh][gi]C[The x stones are not cutting stones, so playing a is worthless.

Just run away with b or c.]HO[1]
(;B[hh];W[gh]MA[hh]C[black a does nothing except "protect" the useless x stone.

Play something like b or c.]HO[1]
(;B[hf]C[white b would be much more severe...]
(;W[jh]C[When defending you want to touch the attacker's stones.  w111 looks too close to your stones, so playing b strengthens you a lot.]

(;B[gg];W[gf];B[ji];W[hg];B[ig];W[ih];B[kh];W[hi]C[white has made a huge profit, and black is still weak.  This is the way to lose games.]
;B[lg];W[ki];B[li];W[kj]MA[qi][ri]C[black a is a pass because the x stones have already been captured.  That is the stone you are trying to capture is not a cutting stone.

b, or cwould be better.]
