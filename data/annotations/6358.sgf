C[I am black.

> hi, i have preceded my comments with a right arrow.

a few general comments here:

* you tend to answer your opponent's threats even if
they are not serious. it takes an effort, but it's important
to look at the whole board after each move as if you didn't
even now what the last move was.

* this is basically the same thing phrased differently: try
to maintain sente.

* you have made a few local miscalculations which cost you dearly. 
(lower left, middle right). this is easier to learn, you just need to
practice. goproblems.com is a good place to do that. (i have no
affiliation with the guy, i just love the site.

feel free to let me know if you have any further questions. you
can reach me at gbohus@yahoo.com

> this is fine. you can also follow w's strategy of ignoring his move and continuing your attack in the lower left or attacking the upper left. i don't think there a single "good" strategy for this, except that you should _not_ always just follow his lead. but if the josekis are correct, there should be any disadvantage going through them.]
