 muad NR : hi];B[pp];W[dd];B[jc];W[pe];B[pg];W[ne];B[nc];W[qc];B[od]C[reid:  this move is aji-keshi.  it helps white more than it helps black.
remember: any move that isn't necessary is a bad move.  black doesn't need
to stay connected, and when white responds at p15, it hurts b q13.];W[oe]
;B[qd];W[pd];B[qb];W[rc];B[pj]C[reid:  now we can see that black should simply play at r18 instead of p16
(and he should not play r16).];W[ob]C[reid: hmmm, seems like white q18 would be more direct :-)]
;B[pb];W[rb];B[nb];W[oa];B[na];W[og]C[reid:  white can tenuki here.  the white group is quite safe now.]
;B[oh];W[ng]C[reid: this is a bit over-concentrated.  since w is strong here,
he might prefer to hane at o12.  or again, tenuki is ok.];B[jq]C[reid: now it looks like white's slow moves (p13-o13) have cancelled
black's earlier mistakes.  game looks even again.];W[dj];B[qg];W[rf]C[
 muad NR : is entering byo-yomi];B[fp];W[hq]C[reid:  hmmm, white is invading in a very small space when there are
still a lot of wide open spaces.  this might be a bit too soon.];B[cn]C
[reid: hmmm, this lets white simply connect under with f3.  more
consistant for black might be to build center thickness with h4.];W[fq]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[gq]C[reid: b cannot seperate white this way.  it's a good sequence to know.]
;W[fr];B[gp];W[gr];B[cp]C[
 snake 5k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[cq];B[do];W[bp];B[dq];W[eo]C[
 muad NR : i think i blow the game :)];B[hp];W[co];B[hr];W[dn]C[reid: this is a big loss for b.  white has a large, secure corner.]
;B[df];W[fd]C[reid: since b already has k17 in place, white might prefer to play
low with f17 instead of f16.];B[ff];W[cg]C[reid: this kind of corner hit is rarely good.  when black responds
simply with c14, white is hurt on both sides.  b c14 is effectively
a splitting attack.];B[cc];W[cd]C[reid: but now white gets to split black instead.  black is too busy
for this 3-3 invasion.];B[ec];W[dc]C[reid: hmmm, if white wants to make the black stones look bad, he
should connect at e16.  while b lives in the corner, white gets
strong outside, and then he can attack the f14 stones.];B[ed];W[ee];B[fc]
;W[fe];B[gd];W[ge];B[hd];W[he];B[ie]C[reid: hard for black to build anything big in this area.  o15 is
just too strong.];W[ef]C[reid: white is too easily satisfied!  he seems to be content with
taking just one stone.  I'd want them both!  i'd try g13 or h13, I think.]
;B[jj];W[id]C[reid: this seems too small.  I think white should probably
take r3 about now.];B[hc]C[reid: too small!  b should j17.  if white cuts at g17, black ataris
at h17.  if white comes down to g18 to capture 3 stones, black gets
r3! huge!!];W[jd];B[kd]C[reid: black's got a problem later if white pushes at j17.
b responds with j18, of course, then white ataris at h18.
looks like b needs to play l18 now (instead of l16) to clean
up this aji.  that's the trouble with a bad-move shape like
b h17 :-(];W[je];B[ic]C[reid: gote :-(];W[if]C[reid: r3 is still bigger.]
;B[gj];W[lc];B[ld];W[md]C[
 muad NR : has entered byo-yomi again];B[mc];W[lb];B[nd];W[me];B[kb];W[ma]
;B[qa]C[reid: this move loses a liberty and the semeai (race to capture).
if b must play here, s19 is better: at least it's sente.  but actually,
black can tenuki.  this is a me-ari-me-nashi (one eye, no eye)
situation.];W[mb]C[
 muad NR : r19 should be p17 :(
 muad NR : 1 eye is enough :)
 muad NR : m18 will die
 muad NR : first :)])
