C[Okay, this is my first review through this service, thanks for sending me the game, i will review it to the best of my abillities.

Next time i would apreciate if you said wich colour you are playing as, i will review both players, but it's hard to give a neutral review this way.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]
(;B[de]C[I would not call this a mistake, but it is far more common to do the alternative move i have shown. (see the move for more info)

If your playstyle is agressive and aims to cut white into smaller groups and fight, then this move is approperiate]

(;W[nc]C[Here white does not finnish his joseki (look at the follow up)]

(;B[ci]C[a bit too far];W[jq]LB[dc:2][nc:1]C[i think white should finish one of his josekis as black can move into either one of them and make a mess of white's stones like the example i am showing.]

(;B[cn]
(;W[dk]C[I am not sure about this move, it seems like a self-pincer, it is rarely smart to play between two black stones like this.]
;B[en]LB[dk:2][dp:1]C[Now white has too choose between stone 1 or two wich is not a good situation for white]

;W[qg];B[nd];W[md];B[qi]TR[nd][pd][pe][qe][pf]C[here black is bashing straight into a white wall while leaving black's unfinished group alone, try not to get closed in like in the alternative move as that gives white some nice central influence.]

;W[im];B[bp];W[bq]
(;B[ap]TR[dk]C[running to the first line is never smart, the marked stone is high so there is allways room to try and crawl under it or live under it]
;W[do];B[dn];W[fo];B[bn]C[A very small move and it is playing within your own potential territory too]
;W[fn];B[ml];W[ck];B[bl];W[bk];B[al]C[Try to play up or sideways before you go down]

Well, as i do not know if you are playing as black or white i cannot give you advise on this one, so you will have to read my comments for any help.]
