C[forfun (hereafter 'ff') - Thanks for an interesting game. There was plenty of interesting moves and fighting spirit shown here. I thought that White made a strategic overplay early that let Black get a pretty good position. This was made worse later by a careless mis-reading that lost a bunch of stones. Despite that, however, White still had chances quite late in the game as both players traded some hard blows. I think that Black had more confidence in the later going and White was not able to punish some overplays.

If there is one thing that would help White to concentrate on it would be the direction of play. We always should have a clear idea of where we will have future opportunities to make territory. Otherwise we end up fighting without a real purpose. Where are the main areas that have not yet been settled? Which directions are my existing stones facing and how do I add stones that will work with them? These are key ideas for developing our ability to control the flow of the game, especially when we have gotten into trouble and need to find the best way out. Let's see what I am talking about...]

(;B[np]C[ff - This is a bad move. Pushing once is never good. It accomplishes little and destroys the aji of a Black play at N3 instead. If the J3 stone were closer, pushing at O4 and then continuing to push is one idea.]
;W[mq]C[ff - White is happy.];B[jd]
(;W[qf]TR[mq]C[San san sería más directo, pero lidiar con el mega moyo a continuación no me atraía. De todos modos, la presencia de N3 me da la sensación de que era el enfoque correcto.

It would be more clear to play san san (R17), but dealing with the huge moyo on the right side didn't appeal me. Anyway, the presence of N3 stone makes me feel that R17 would've been the right choice.

ff - Since the position is unbalanced, Black will naturally respond to R17 by blocking on R16. There are a number of pro games from the 1990's that feature this arrangement on the right side of the board (with some minor variations in the lower left and upper left corners and without the O4/N3 exchange). Fifteen out of sixteen times in my database the pros played R14 here. Good choice! :-)]

(;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[pi];B[qj]C[Ahora viene el momento creativo del día. En la variante considero algo más seguro.

Now it comes the creative moment of the day. The variation shows a safer approach.]

(;W[ok]C[ff - This looks like an overplay. Black's bottom right corner is very strong. Overall on the right side we see five White stones facing twelve Black stones. White should not want to start a complicated fight on the right side since White must be in more danger than Black. What is White's goal here? Where will White make territory out of this idea? White naturally wants to invade the top. However, this move invites Black to cut White in two in the center. White is likely to end up with too many separate groups without corresponding weak groups for Black. See the second variation for an alternative idea.]

(;B[oj];W[pj];B[qk]
(;W[le]C[ff - Of course this is a ladder breaker, but so what? White is guilty of playing a "cool move". This is not enough. Just because an idea is clever does not mean that it is helpful in the given position. And really, a ladder breaker is not an especially clever idea - it is one of the basics of Go. White has made this a ladder breaker by inviting Black to cut White at P10. This is a loss for White. As a result, White has to gain at least as much at the top as he lost in the center right.]

(;B[nj]C[ff - OK, so Black reads the ladder and reacts in a very conservative way. Black had various alternatives that would have emphasized cutting the White stones apart more than this. See the variation for an alternative. I think White is rather lucky here.]
;W[lc];B[nf]C[ff - White breaks the line between O16 and K16. In return Black encloses the right side.]
;W[lg];B[nh]C[Se ve todo muy dudoso, pero me parece interesante. La próxima jugada parece un error.

Everything looks doubtful, but I think it's interesting. The next play, though, looks as a mistake.

Desperate about using the dead stones, but in a very territorial and boring way and without using the three marked stones (the very point of all the manouver). A pincer to K16 seems the natural thing to do. See variation.]

I should have make directly the pincer, without the exchange of C14 for D18? Now an attack over the black group seems hard.

ff - The trouble is that Black has taken the right side in exchange for the M15/M13 stones. The K16 stone is light.]

At the time I thought that maybe this was enough compensation, but the black grupo of H16 and company now has no weaknesess, so now I think that black has clearly a lead.

ff - I agree with your assessment. The 3-3 point at R17 was open for White anyway. So far White has gotten nothing for allowing Black to live on a realtively large scale on the upper left.]

(;B[ra]C[No sé cómo me las arreglé para overlookear esta muerte. Ahora la situación estaba muy difícil.

I don't know how did I manage to overlook this killing :P Now the situation is very tough on white.

ff - Actually White should probably resign now. Better to start a new game next time. :-)]

(;W[mp]C[ff - This seems like it has zero chance to turn things around. Is there anything better?

Although White died in the upper right, Black gave back half those points in the upper left (ignoring the ko for now). There are really two questions left in this game:

1. Can Black capture the center right White stones?

2. How many points can White make on the left side of the board?

If White can enclose the left without the center stones dying, there is still a chance here. So starting out by playing in the lower right is the wrong direction of play.]

Instead of capturing I should have fixed the cut while ending the aji, playing A. The difference was that the ataris in the marked area made stronger the black group in the bottom, so I wouldn't be able to get any points there.
I thought this wasn't enough, so I went to an all-in strategy. You could say I lost control. See variation.]

The cut, at the end, was my doom. The only think I could aspire to after living with the centre group was to kill the one in the lower side, which doesn't seem very possible.

End of comments, thanks for reading!

ff - I would say that although Black is ahead, White has not yet lost this game necessarily! What finishes White off is the losses that occur in the center as White struggles to live. White voluntarily strengthens Black's center while creating a shortage of liberties on the L10 stones, which later end up captured. If White could have lived more efficiently, the game might yet turn in his favor.]

(;B[pc]C[ff - It seems to me there is another possible play here for Black. What if he blocks in the corner. The point is that the right-side stones can only make a small life at best. If Black settles for the corner then the three White stones on the outside will have no base and Black should get the first move in order to use K16 to attack the three stones.

All this illustrates that Black is stronger than White here. White has to assess the overall strength of the two sides in deciding what is 'interesting' and what is not.]

I don't know is this was the correct way, but it seems more coherent with the spirit of M15.
