C[Hello and thank you fro reveiwing my game.  I was bored this morning so I decided to play on an account I haven't used since I was 8k.  I had to to beat a 9k to get my rank to (6k?) so that ppl around my level would accept my challenges.  on my other 2 accounts I am 5kyu and 4kyu.  My main account is artboy598 if you ever want a game on KGS.

So anyway, I played against a 3k.  I was ahead most of the game and made some tactical errors and I ONLY won because my opponent misjudged the status of a group in the end game and I killed it.  I would like you to tell me what I should work on and what I can do to improve.  I don't have any specific questions about the game.  Thank you! :D


TM—Hi there, I'm the reviewer. You played well, although you made some big tactical mistakes that would have cost you the game if white had been more careful right at the end.

The main points that you should pay attention to here are:

1) When building a moyo, think about preventing your opponent from breaking into it. (See moves 33, 37, etc.) Conversely, advice for white: don't merely try to live on the edge if you can instead jump out into the centre. Otherwise even if you live you will help your opponent build influence.

2) Be very careful with stones near the edge of the board; don't be afraid to play a defensive move in gote. (See move 87.) You don't need to always be on the attack, you only need to win by half a point ...

3) A matter of tactics at move 101: carefully think about which side you want to cut on, and be willing to switch tactics (move 103) if the cut fails.

4) Tenuki is good, but always think twice before ignoring threats! (See moves 140+.)

I hope this helps!

;B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[go]LB[cj:A]C[TM—This kind of move should only be used when white is building a large-scale moyo, since it helps black secure territory on the bottom. Without a wall at the top, white should instead play at A.]
;B[hp]C[Was this correct or should I have simply playedH3 to be on the safe side?

TM—This is correct. H3 would have been submissive.];W[qg]
;B[qj];W[mc];B[oe]C[TM—This seems like a reasonable answer to a very uncommon approach.]
;W[lq];B[nq]C[I didn't know I to handle this so I just decided to push him into the stronger group.

TM—This looks good.];W[jr]LB[lo:A]C[TM—White should instead jump out at A to prevent black from building a moyo.]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[lp];W[mq];B[mp];W[nr];B[or];W[mr]C[TM—A disastrous result for white.]

(;B[qn]LB[qn:A][ls:B];W[ls]C[I have a variation I want you to take a look at.

TM—The variation is good, but so is the game move. Here white has only a small life, while black has great influence.]
;B[jd]C[Was this too soft?

TM—Well, it depends on your goals. Are you trying to capture the top stone? Build a moyo?]
;W[mf]C[I can't understand this W move.

TM—White is trying to keep K16 disconnected from your corner stones. Also he wants to prevent you from building a wall on the top, for that would give black half the board. Still, white has been dancing around the corner too lightly.]
;B[og]LB[ph:A]C[TM—Consider instead pressing down more severely at A.]
;W[ph];B[mg]C[I was trying to execute a leaning attack on this W group?  Are there better ways to attack?

TM—This looks promising. You should at the same time be planning how best to press down on Q12.]
;W[lf]
(;B[re]C[I thought that I had to get rid of W base to keep him on the run with no eyes.

TM—Since you're building a moyo, it's probably better to hit white from above and let him find a small life. See variation.]

(;W[qe]C[TM—White should take this opportunity to jump out into the centre instead of hitting himself against your stones. See variation.]
;B[qd];W[qf]C[Why didn't W play S14?

TM—A big mistake indeed. White has lost sente and is heavy.]
;B[ni]LB[oi:A][oj:B]C[I thnk I should push at M13andL13 first.

TM—I would play the severe move at A instead, or a jump to B to prevent white from reducing your moyo. Pushing earlier would have been a good idea, but at this point white would probably ignore it, preferring to find life for his stones on the side.]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[rf];B[rd]C[I think this was my first big mistake because I can play at S12 and W only gets 1 eye in gote.]
;W[qi];B[oj]C[Second mistake I think. I must S10 first.

TM—This looks fine in terms of closing off your moyo. Playing instead at S10 might let white escape into the centre. In any case, you can see how it would have helped to have pressed down harder in the beginning.]
;W[rj];B[pi];W[rk];B[lg]C[I think I should have done this earlier, but it still looks ugent.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[jf]
(;B[fc]C[Too far? Is G17 better?

TM—Looks fine. You can treat K16 lightly. (You played it as a light move in the first place, right?)]
;W[hc];B[hd]
(;W[ic]C[TM—This feels a bit submissive. See variation.];B[id]
;W[jc];B[ld]C[TM—Just be careful not to get too greedy. It looks like you're trying to eat everything.]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[ke];B[lc]
(;W[kb]C[I thought W would play N16 and make things complex.

TM—There are certainly better choices for white. It seems he was worried about losing the three stones, since it might not be clear whether the M17 stones can be captured. In that case he should escape at G16.]
;B[md]C[I know, dumb DDK mistake. I should play M18];W[lb];B[nc]
;W[mb]C[TM—White should play G16 instead.];B[gd]C[TM—You were lucky here. If white had taken G16 first, then you would have been in trouble.]
;W[nb];B[oc]TR[hg][ig][ih]C[TM—You should instead tenuki and play one of the triangles (for example) to attack white's heavy group.]
;W[rm]C[TM— ... and for his part, white should also be concerned about his centre group, which is an urgent matter.]
;B[ih]C[TM—Good.];W[rn];B[pm];W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[cl];W[cj]
;B[co];W[do];B[cn];W[dm];B[cp];W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[dl]TR[bl]
[br]C[TM—Greedy. This kind of move leads to bad shape, as you soon found out in the game. Play a defensive move instead, such as one of the triangles.]

(;W[el]C[TM—White could alternatively punish right away.]
;B[dj]C[Another mistake I think. Something like C7 or B5 should be fine. I keep forgetting to count in my games.

TM—Yes, you must absolutely defend.];W[cm]C[Now the pain begins.]
;B[bm];W[bl];B[bk];W[bn];B[al];W[bp];B[ek]C[I made this move simply for shape.]
;W[fl];B[im];W[in]
(;B[jn]TR[in][go]C[TM—Consider a hane on the other side. You are already strong on this side and should instead separate the marked stones. See variation.]
;W[io];B[jo]LB[ip:A]C[TM—Since you won't be able to capture these stones, better to connect at A. You lose too many points by letting white cut you off like this.]
;W[ip];B[iq]TR[go]C[I should have played tenuki here.  This move does nothing to help me.

TM—Compare to the same move (#105) in the variation. The point of the hane on the other side is that it separates white's invading stone from the marked one.]
;W[jq];B[hm];W[gn];B[cc]C[Would the double approach have been better?  I figured whichever way W blocked, his wall would be useless and I would have sente.

TM—This looks fine.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec];W[ci]
(;B[eg]LB[cf:A][cg:B][dg:C][dh:D]C[Would something Like C14 work?

TM—This move is too shallow, but C14 (A) might be too deep. Playing farther from white's wall, but lower, should be easier for black (B, C, D). See variations. In any case, you are far ahead in territory, so you can afford to keep this simple, even if white lives.]
;W[gf];B[fe];W[cg];B[dh]LB[bh:A]C[I think this is bad shapr for B.  It make W stronger for no reason. Would peeping from the other side be a clever move?

TM—Yes, peeping from the other side, at A, looks good.];W[ch]
;B[bd]LB[bc:A]C[TM—Consider playing at A instead to avoid giving white sente.]
;W[be];B[bc];W[bj];B[ae];W[bf];B[df];W[ee];B[ff]C[I should Have palyed E14. W can't play F16 because I can play C15 and catch him.

TM—Right.];W[aj]
(;B[ag]C[TM—There is a better way to kill. See variation.]
;W[af];B[ah];W[bh]
(;B[ai]C[Its a seki for the mean time.

TM—Since you can see it's going to be a seki, you could instead let him live in exchange for the four stones at the top. See variation.]
;W[cf];B[gj];W[hk];B[gk];W[dg]C[I didn't question this move because I counted that I was ahead. I have this really bad tendency to stop caring when I'm ahead ad drop my guard.]

It doesn't matter, he's not my opponent.

TM—It looks like Vietnamese to me.];B[fd]LB[ei:A]C[tuanbk1987 [?\]: ???

This is that really bad habit I was talking about kicking in.

TM—Right. This move serves little purpose. You must, of course, play at A instead.]

TM—What about A instead?];W[on];B[pn];W[np];B[oq];W[no];B[lo]

TM—Right, you have nothing to gain here. Pull back to A instead.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[fg];B[bo]C[majorzero [6k?\]: misclick

My opponent didn't say anything but I guess he didn't beleive me. :(

TM—White should not ignore this ko threat. See variation. Also, I don't understand how this is a misclick: you just said that you wanted to use the aji here, right?]

TM—White's top group is alive, although at this point in the endgame he should play a defensive move inside it at A.]
;B[ia]LB[ja:B][hb:A][ib:C]C[TM—A good endgame play. White must not defend at A, for then he dies (as in the game). He can live in gote at B, or if desperate can start a ko at C.]

(;W[hb];B[jb]C[Well, It's pretty much over now.  I gave a sigh of relief when I was able to kill this.  I've been doing Tsumego eveyday all last week and I instantly saw this.

Well the game is over.  Thank you for looking at my reveiw. Please point out my main flaw and tell me what I can do to fix it.]

(;W[ja];B[hb];W[la];B[gc];W[jb]C[TM—White lives in gote and loses almost 10 points—enough to make a very close game. White should still be able to win by a couple of points if he plays carefully.]

[jg][kg][lg][mg][ng]C[TM—Although saving the middle stones would be worth many points, keeping the bottom left dead is worth more for white.

At a glance, the lower left is worth about:
    3 × 10 white's territory
 + 10 captures
 + 10 more territory for black if he lives there
 = 50

But the middle is only worth about:
    3 × 8 black's territory
 + 8 captures
 + 0 more territory for white if he lives there
 = 32

Thus, not only is the bottom left a bigger area with more stones to capture, it also offers black points for territory if he lives there, whereas white gains no territory by saving the centre.]
