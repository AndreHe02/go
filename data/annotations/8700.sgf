C[Hi There,
Wow - This game was nuts. I felt that I was quite a bit ahead until middle game, then I made a series of blunders and/or my opponent got the upper hand a few times and I lost really badly. Would appreciate any feedback.
I'll write out my thoughts to help explain why I made various moves.
I was playing white. 6k on KGS.
(Derek)

Hello Derek,
I am lorl (1k on KGS). I will try to comment your game and answer to your questions.
Feel free to mail me back if you have additional remarks ;-)

this move is still bad, and it will be shown at the next move...
(LL)];B[fq]C[good answer : now black is strong and attacks on both sides !
(LL)];W[dq]C[Too greedy? Should I have strengthened by group first before trying to protect the corner?
(Derek)

at this stage, white has to make a choice between taking the corner and defending his other week group. I agree with you considering the corner is bigger.

(Derek)

the shape is clearly bad, and white's group will again be under pressure after black H6. I prefer the alternative move.
(LL)];B[hn];W[pm]C[Pressure the black group while building territory. I'm aware my group is really weak, but I felt this was kind of a free move.

ok : this move is very big. but of course, you will have to take care of your weak group afterward.

it is a good direction : developping and restricting black's influence, but this stone is perhaps a bit too far, and "x" points could become weaknesses later.
