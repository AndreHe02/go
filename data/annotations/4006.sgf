C[Hi, I'm greendemon, I played white.  Thanks in advance for the review.  I only lose this game by 4.5 points, but there were several kos, and I have trouble counting who comes out ahead in those sorts of things.  Similarly, I'm wondering if I could have picked up those 5 points in the endgame somewhere?  thanks for your time.]

;B[on]TR[qn]C[Usually white extends along the side first, to prevent black playing there himself and then if black jumps out again white can either attach as you did here or jump out one more. (See variations.)]

(;W[oq];B[nq];W[or]TR[pq]C[This move should be at Q3 - as it is black can play O4 in sente which gives him a good result.]

(;B[mp];W[jq]TR[lq]C[I wasn't sure what to play here, but the corner seemed safe so I wante to try to stretch to the left and build moyo there.

If P2 was at Q3, you could simply play M3 here which would be safe as it leaves a connection (O2) to the corner in reserve. Here black can cut it in sente however, so your move seems fine.

If you want to build a moyo you should consider pressing down on the C5 stone first.]
;B[bq];W[qn];B[pp];W[qq];B[lq]
(;W[kp]C[There are bigger points to play at the moment - this isn't an essential stone. Consider preventing black's sanrensei at the top or an approach move to one of the corners.]
;B[nr];W[pq]C[This is just an endgame move - black had no strong follow-up, think bigger in the opening.]
;B[pn]C[This move needs a response much more than the previous two, as it threatens to close white in with the hane, but tenuki is ok if you keep sente to come back.]
;W[cf];B[fd];W[bd];B[jd];W[cc];B[md]C[No need to invade while there are still big extensions and approaches around - you could consider putting pressure on the C5 group for example. Although this is a good point to invade later.]

(;W[hd]C[This didn't work very well at all.];B[hc]
(;W[gc]C[Perhaps hane on the other side so that you can cut off the two black stones if black cuts (see variation).]
;B[gd]
(;W[hb]C[It's better to atari in the other direction to keep black's stones separated (see variation).]
;B[ic];W[ec];B[fc];W[eb];B[gb];W[ed];B[ee];W[de];B[df];W[ce]
TR[qc][qf]C[so I have a bigger corner, but his moyo becomes almost inpenetrable.

He doesn't have that big a moyo yet - there are still many gaps, but he does have quite a lot of territory on top. However there is still the approach on the right side or the 3-3 invasion. So the game is still roughly even (you have two big corners).]
;B[ef];W[ch]C[There are bigger moves on the right side - don't let black extend from the other side of the corner to combine with his territory on top.]
;B[qf]
(;W[pm]C[I guess this move was too small.  Maybe r10 or so?

Remember you ignored a black move (Q6) around here so the hane leaves you too weak - black can cut. He probably won't want to cut immediately, but later on it may become a good move which you have to spend another move defending agianst. Perhaps the best move here is just to extend solidly with R7.]
;B[qi]C[The 3-3 (or 3-4 or similar) invasion is still possible and one of the few remaining ways to reduce black's large territory, so it is now urgent.]

(;W[qk];B[qc];W[cm]C[This is a good point.];B[cr];W[dr];B[gp]

(;W[gq]C[This white response is too submissive, think about attack both the corner and this stone simultaneously with a one point jump into the center.]
;B[hq];W[hp];B[fq];W[gr];B[fp];W[fr];B[ho];W[ip];B[eo]
(;W[bn]C[You can create serious cutting points in black's position by playing D5 here.]
;B[dp];W[eq];B[cp];W[em];B[fn];W[ei];B[gi]
(;W[fh]C[my intention here was to threaten invation and maybe build on it later.  Looking back it seems like kindof a wasted move.

Yes, this just helps black reinforce his boundaries and removes other possibilities for later. See variations for some better moves.]
;B[hg];W[ph]C[I knew I had to try to keep black's moyo down, but I was at a loss as to how.this wasn't it, tho.

This looks like a reasonable attempt, a shoulder hit like this is often a good reducing move.]
;B[pi]
(;W[oi]C[Perhaps play more lightly here (see variation).];B[oh]
;W[nh];B[og];W[mi];B[oj];W[nj];B[ni];W[mk];B[ng];W[mh];B[mg]
;W[ok];B[lh]C[Now that you've reduced black's moyo you can think about attacking the O3 group as it's cut off and not alive yet.]

(;W[gj];B[li];W[oi];B[hi]C[Capturing P10 is big here - it has a follow-up (see variation), while it is unlikely that black can make much more territory around the J9 area.

As well as the attack on the lower right, the lower left can also be attacked! Be more aware of your opponent's potentially weak groups.]

(;W[hj];B[ni];W[mj];B[fj];W[fi]C[I think if black had played more aggressevely, I might have lost more territory here i think.  was this cut the right response to f10?

The cut is right, but as you say, either your stones will get cut off or you will lose some territory.]
;B[fl];W[fk];B[el]
(;W[dl];B[ek];W[ej]
(;B[fm];W[dk];B[ij];W[ik];B[jj]
(;W[gn];B[go];W[hn];B[in];W[hm]C[Not a useful sequence - abandon these stones for now.]
;B[im];W[hl];B[io]C[So this seems bad, especially since it ruins my chance to kill the black group on the right later.]
;W[mo]C[Good, attack this group.];B[no];W[mn];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr]
;W[mr];B[nn];W[mq];B[mm]
(;W[np]C[So here the first ko fight starts.  I guess black has more threats than I do, but i don't think I need this ko to kill.

This isn't really a ko fight as you fall back the first time black takes the ko instead of making a ko threat. If you plan to do that, you're just using up one of black's ko threats, you're not fighting the ko.

A better way is to play M7 instead of taking the ko, shutting black in and forcing him to win the ko to live. You would want to have a few good ko threats in mind to do this as black has some local threats pushing against the nearby white stones, but its very serious for black!]
;B[jp];W[jo];B[mp];W[ks];B[ln];W[lo];B[nm]
(;W[lm]C[This move gives black a chance to escape, one above it is much stronger (see variation).]
;B[ll];W[kn];B[ml];W[lk];B[kl]C[black escapes.  Was this preventable?  It seems like I could have killed black, but I'm not sure how.

You still have a very good chance to kill the lower left now (see variation)!]

(;W[np];B[jl];W[pj];B[oi];W[rj];B[ri];W[ns]C[As we will see, more important to defend around Q9 :).]
;B[qm];W[pl];B[qo];W[rn];B[ro];W[rm];B[rp];W[rq];B[qj];W[rk]
;B[pk]C[a second ko.

This ko doesn't seem important as you can connect at P8 - no need to fight this (it is a 'picnic ko' for black - no risk for him, you can lose a lot tho).]

(;W[il]C[I thought this threat was good, but blacks response protects his stones and threatens mine...]
;B[ol]C[Yep, now the ko is real one.];W[pj];B[iq]C[I thought about maybe letting this go, and playing Q9.  Which is bigger?

As the lower left can still be killed later, you should respond. Otherwise you are right, don't respond as the ko is worth a lot to you, and this threat doesn't let black actually cut you at the bottom.]
;W[jp];B[pk];W[hf]C[I'm kindof bluffing here =\].  Again, I'm not sure if this qualifies as a real threat, but black takes the bait.

This doesn't look big enough.];B[gg];W[pj];B[gk];W[pk]C[I fill in, but it starts a new ko, one even worse for me...]
;B[fj];W[lc]C[another bluff.  I think as black i would have ignored this.  But thankfully he didn't.

Yep black should ignore this.];B[mc];W[fk];B[gl];W[hk];B[fj]
;W[kk]C[Black has to play K9 here!];B[fk];W[jk]C[You got a good result here - black took gote and can still be attacked.]
;B[jm]C[so both strings of stones escape.  did black mismanage the kos, or did I?

Both of you did a bit, you got involved in a disadvantageous ko when it could have been avoided and you made some ko threats that weren't relevant or didn't have a big enough follow-up. And black played the worthless move of F9 instead of K9.]

(;W[en]C[The eye at F5 is already false, see variations for how to do better.]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[cn];W[bo];B[fo];W[cq];B[bp]C[Black's given you a chance to kill all his stones here...]
;W[fg];B[br]C[Even now, can play Q5 to kill all unconditionally!]

(;W[es];B[ff];W[dg]C[Is this move too small?  as I read it, all the moves on the board are in the 3-4 point range, unless I'm missing something.

Well apart from the 100-ish point move of killing black :) There's T11 (sente), T3 (reverse sente), and a nasty ko black can play against you at O9, but otherwise you're right.]
