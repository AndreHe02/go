TR[qn][po]C[Tami: Black probably ought to finish the joseki with R6 or Q5.]

(;W[iq]C[Jaydee [9k\]: where do you live and go to school?

Tami: this is normal, when black has played at R6, but here you miss the chance to play at R5 and choke off the corner.]
;B[gc]C[Potter117 [7k\]: Live in greensboro NC.
Jaydee [9k\]: oh ok, I am in Colorado];W[ec]C[Tami: this does not prevent the corner being invaded, but it's not bad.]
;B[jd];W[cf]LB[ic:A]C[Tami: later, you can invade at A, so White is happy here.]
;B[ck]LB[ch:A][cn:B][ep:C]C[zmeufioros [10k\]: hi all
zmeufioros [10k\]: would u d a review after the game?

Tami: A and B are "miai" (if you take one, the opponent gets the other). So, it's not urgent to play at A or B. C would have been a nice point. Enclosing a 3-4 corner is always very high priority in the opening.]
;W[cm];B[ch];W[el]C[Tami: nice move, building a moyo in the lower left while attacking!]
;B[fq]TR[ch][ck]C[Tami: black should have strengthened the marked group before trying to handle the bottom.]
;W[dq];B[go];W[in];B[gm]C[Tami: Black now has two weak groups, and it will hard to handle them safely.]
;W[il];B[en]
(;W[dl]C[Tami: strange move. I guess you were trying to prevent black connecting, but I doubt this move was necessary.]

(;W[oj]C[Tami: nice move, but possibly R5 was still better.]

;W[hh];B[fe];W[ph]C[Tami: Black needs to do something about your moyo.]

(;B[md]C[Tami: this move is large, but passive. Black really had to erase the moyo here.]

(;W[pl];B[ql];W[pk];B[qk];W[jg]LB[ke:C][le:B][oe:A]C[Tami: too passive - you build moyos by pressing down actively on the opponent, not by just encircling territory. A, B and C were probably better because they expand your position while hurting the opponent's.]

(;B[mg]C[Tami: black has the right idea, which is to come in lightly. This approach often comes off better than a deep invasion.]
;W[lh]LB[oi:A]C[Tami: if I were Black, I'd be itching to fight by cutting at A.]
;B[kf]C[Tami: both your move and his were passive.];W[mh];B[of]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[lg];B[lf];W[og];B[gk];W[gl]C[Tami: sometimes you can cut ikken tobi (one-space jump), but about 9 times out of 10 the attempt fails and makes the opponent's position stronger.]
;B[fl];W[hl];B[fk];W[em];B[fm]C[Tami: black got a bit stronger here.]

;W[es];B[fs];W[ds];B[hs];W[if]C[Tami: yes, of course you should not just answer passsively, but your move is not very threatening to black. Against a move like H1, you generally have to answer.]

(;B[he]C[Tami: missing a good chance. White is not threatening anything here.]

C[Tami: black is just following passively. J1 was still good.]
