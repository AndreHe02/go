C[Hello,
My name is Arnold. In this game I play black.
I think it is evident from this game that my "global" thinking is not developed very much. There are also deficites in invading and elsewhere.
There are many weaknesses in my play and I´m looking forward to the review.
Thanks in advance.

--------------------------------------------------
Hi! My nick on kgs is wjzz, i'm 8 kyu EGF. I think you played an interesting game, so i wil be able to give you some pieces of advice. In my opinion you should try to watch a few games played by pro or high dan players, to "steal" some moves from them, sometimes it really helps.]
;B[qp];W[pd];B[eq];W[cd]LB[cp:C][op:B][cq:D][oq:A]TR[jc][qj]
SQ[qc]C[Let's discuss the first 4 moves. We have here 3 types of corner moves:

1. Komoku (small point in japanese) R4 and C16. This a teritorial move, which aims next at securing the whole corner by playing a shimari - a move at a or b (there are few other enclosures, but they are more tough to play). Playing at a or b (a is more solid) gives you about 10 points of secure territory. That's why your opponents will usually play a move at A or B to not give the chance to enclosure the corner

2.Hoshi - the star point move Q16 is a flexible move, which can take territory, but is not "designed" for it. The idea of hoshi is extend in two ways(marked traingles)  in order to build a huge sphere of influence and then territory. Hoshi has a  weak point at the square. I gave a set pattern called the 3-3 invasion

3.Mokuhazushi E3 is directed toward outside influnce not terriory! White can play either c or d and take the whole corner, and unlike the case with hoshi a move at c is very urgent fot your opponet.]

(;B[ck]LB[ed:B][qf:C][cp:A][op:D]C[So as i said the 5-3 point (E3) is not very helpful to take territory. If u have to take terriotory using the 5-3 stone, you should enclosure the croner first, with the C4 move. C9 is an extention and the the rule is first close the corner then extend. This is where the hoshi move shows its pros. if you play a symetrical move like 4-4 or 3-3 you dont have to add any more moves before extending. In this case i would recommend to play one of this moves:


A sets up a great move a c10 next. if your opponet tries to take the great move from you, you can attack his corner with B or E17

B attacks the corner and usually some exchange takes place in this part of the board.

C attacks the hoshi stone 

D.is a big enclosure which cooperates with the side and influnce orriented 5-3 stone in E-5]
;W[kq];B[mq]C[This is ok, attacking the weak stones is a good idea.]
;W[hq];B[lo]C[This one maybe could be played at R9 or R10

------------------------------------
wjzz: i think that if you started to attack dont switch so fast
put the pressure on white and while doing it build your own possition]
;W[ko];B[qj];W[qh];B[kn]C[in my opinion you should decide what is your priority. if you want to build a moyo the you should attack and then play R10 followed by P10 for example. you have to bear in mind that you have a quitre serious weakness at P4 or P3, though.]
;W[jo];B[ln];W[ci];B[gn]C[this is a strange move. it;s to loose to build a moyo and isn much of an attack.]
;W[ho];B[gr];W[hr];B[gq]C[I´m thinking of two moyos left and right]
;W[gp]LB[cn:A]C[this only helped you. i think a white around a would be a nice reducing move]
;B[fp];W[fo];B[go];W[hp];B[eo];W[fn];B[fm];W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[there is a famous proverb :"dont touch what you want to attack"
you're only helping white instead];W[bp];B[bo]C[this is to dangerous. you invite him to live instead of killing him]
;W[aq];B[co]C[Because my life and death skills are actually not really good I decided to let W live small.

------------------------------------------------------------
my advice - life and death is fundamental. buy yourself a book with go problems or check out this website :www.goproblems.com

my advice 2 - if u dont know what do to do dont help your oppent live by all means]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[cr];B[er];W[br];B[dp];W[ej];B[jc]LB[oj:A]C[There are surely other, more urgent and/or better moves but i did/do not see where

---------------------------------
i think your move is ok. in the close future i'd like to play A to build a nice moyo.]
;W[hc];B[oc]LB[mc:B][nc:C][nd:A]C[this move, the shoulder hit is wrong
A or B would be more usual or if u feel strong C];W[pc];B[pb]

;W[of];B[kc]TR[hj][gk][im]SQ[ji][mi][oi][jl][pl][nm]C[Maybe I could have started to build a moyo in the middle arond M9]
;W[dl];B[dk];W[ek];B[el];W[cl];B[bl];W[bm];B[cm];W[dm]C[Here I think playing that sequence as it happened is best for B]
;B[bk];W[cn];B[dn];W[hn];B[en]C[you did well in the last sequence.]
;W[fl];B[em];W[hl];B[gl];W[gk];B[fk];W[fj]C[Well, with the pevious moves I gave W much influenece on the middle of the board]
;B[mk]LB[oj:A][ok:B]C[This is supposed to prevent W from getting in that area but W invaded. Probably this was too greedy

-----------------------------
this is too loose A or B would be more solid];W[ok];B[oj];W[ql]

you dont have too much terriotory right now]

you played great yose so far. your opponet answered most of your moves and was too mild sometimes C12 was a big mistake i think]

----------------------------------
you managed to win already a lost game. using your opponets mistakes is a very important thing. you should think more about securing corners, because its tough to make territory in the center.
i hope my comments helped you, if u have any questions talk to me on KGS i'm wjzz there.
