C[N: Hi, I'm Numsgil on KGS, currently ranked as 4k.

I'll prefix my comments with N:

...

Basically:

1.  Both players played on the second line in the opening.  It can be scary to ignore a move on the second line, as it can threaten to dig out large amounts of territory.  But in the opening, there are bigger places to play.

The exception to this is if you need eyespace to live, or you're poking out eyes.  But make sure the group can't run first.

2.  The game could have been won or lost in the end game with better ordering of moves.  But this comes with practice and reading strength.

3.  Be aware of what your moves are trying to do.  Or put another way: have a plan.  Placing a stone in a wide open area can feel powerful, but if it doesn't reduce a moyo, attack a weak group, or connect stones together, it's just a move.]
;B[pd]C[seng [12k\]: hihi];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[df]
TR[cf]CR[dd]C[N: This is a bit too conservative for black.  The usual moves are either trirangle or circle.

Generally speaking, when an opponent attaches to a lone stone of yours, your gut instinct should be to hane on the "outside", which is triangle in this position.]
;W[cf];B[dh]TR[dg][ef][ee][dd]CR[cg]C[N: No, this is bad, for a number of reasons.

First, black's group only has 4 liberties (the triangles).  You want to continue contact until you have 5 or 6 liberties.  Don't jump away like this.

Second, this sort of one space jump is never a good idea when you're facing the center.  You want to make a one space jump like this only when you're near the edge.  Otherwise, it's too easy for white to make a cut or threaten to cut and get a forcing exchange in.

As far as moves for white, wedging in is an option, as is just circle and then white making a one point jump himself.]
(;W[qj]C[N: White should not tenuki.  The left side is still unsettled and therefore urgent.]
;B[cg]C[N: Yes, black punishes white.  White has no access to the side anymore.]
;W[gc]C[N: White is leaving behind weaknesses.]
(;B[bf]C[N: Wrong side.  Even if it weren't, this is a move on the second line, which means it's small.]
;W[cd];B[be]C[N: Again, a move on the second line, which makes this small.  White can ignore this and make a big move elsewhere.]
;W[bd];B[ck]CR[cl]C[N: I'd go for a wider extension to circle, but it's a matter of taste, I think.]
;W[qf];B[mc]CR[qd][rd]TR[qh]C[N: Black is playing really loosely.  This move isn't bad, but it does leave behind a lot of weaknesses white can exploit later.  I'd simply defend the corner with either circle.  White will need to defend still against an invasion at triangle.]
;W[of]C[N: White has a nice framework going here now.  Black's still a bit thin in the corner.]
;B[qn]
(;W[rd]CR[qc]C[N: White should just invade at circle.  The tactics for living can be tricky, but see var. for what I'm invisioning.]
;B[qc];W[jc];B[fq]C[N: Black likes wide approaches and shimaris.  Because black has the opposite corner, a close approach would be more kosher.]
;W[dr]CR[cm][dq]C[N: Don't play on the second line.  Choose either circle if you want to defend (D3 is probably the closest you what you were thinking).]
;B[dq]CR[jp]C[N: Black, what's your aim?  Do you think you can kill the corner (unlikely)?  Are you trying to develop influence towards the right side (then circle would be better).

I don't think this is bad, but it's aimless.];W[cq];B[er]CR[jp]
C[N: Don't play on the second line.  Circle is still a good moyo point.

The thing is, white doesn't have to defend.  In fact, if black tries to take white's stone, it's gote, so white would get effectively two free moves elsewhere on the board.]
(;W[cs]C[N: If the second line is bad, the first line is worse.]
;B[dp];W[cn]CR[do][co]C[N: Not bad, but either circle would be better (you eventually want to hane, but it depends on how confident you are you can handle a cut).]
;B[jp]C[N: Yes, good];W[nd];B[md]CR[nc]C[N: Careful black, you're sacrificing your corner for a weak group to run through the center.

Circle is so many times better, even if it allows white to build a moyo.]
;W[mf]CR[nc]TR[nd]C[N: No, white.  Triangle threatens to cut.  You must follow through to circle.  Black's stones will be in trouble, and you're should be find (neither white's top or side are thin).]
;B[nc]C[N: Yes, this point is still urgent.];W[od]C[N: Okay]
;B[oc];W[en]CR[do]C[N: Circle is the more natural shape point.  This is playable, though, if you don't mind handling black at circle.]
;B[do]C[N: White apparently wants black to play here.  Why not oblige? :P]
(;W[co]TR[en]CR[bm]C[N: This makes triangle seem like a silly move.

Believe it or not, circle is actually the better move.];B[dn]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[cl]
(;B[dl];W[bm];B[em];W[cm];B[fn]CR[ek]C[N: This isn't an important stone (black's lower group can live no problem), and black has lots of cutting points to worry about.  Circle protects those cutting points.]
;W[dk];B[cj];W[el];B[fm]C[N: White's broke out into the center now.]
;W[fl];B[dj]C[N: This doesn't threaten white, so white doesn't have to respond locally.]
;W[ej]CR[gl]C[N: Circle is better.];B[ff];W[pl];B[rl]CR[on]
C[N: Second line again.  Circle is better, as it protects black's moyo.]
;W[rk]C[N: Second line.  What does white do if black ignores this move to take sente?]
;B[mp]C[N: Okay];W[fh];B[fg];W[hl];B[km]CR[hn]C[N: I'd prefer circle.  This feels too thin and aimless.]
;W[rm]CR[gm][hn]C[N: This isn't an important stone, white.  Either circle would be a reasonable move.]
;B[qm];W[ql];B[rn]
(;W[sm]C[N: This feels validating, but all you're doing is removing a possible sente play for yourself in the endgame.  See var.]
;B[jg]CR[nl][nj]TR[om]C[N: This doesn't actually do anything, black.  This whole area is basically dame.

Circles and triangle would be reductions against white's moyo.  Triangle is extra nice because it grows black's moyo.]
;W[hn]C[N: Yeah, this reduces black's moyo.];B[ho];W[go];B[gn]
;W[fo];B[eo];W[gm]C[N: Nice squeeze.];B[en]
(;W[hp]C[N: No, wrong side. see var.];B[io];W[gq]C[N: White has committed himself to living here or capturing black.]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[gr]
(;W[hr];B[ip];W[hq]
(;B[hs];W[ir];B[jr];W[eq];B[ep];W[is];B[gs]C[N: Black wins the race.]
;W[nm]C[N: good reduction.  Also expands white's moyo a bit.]
;B[kk]CR[mh][mi][mj][mk]TR[oo]C[N: This doesn't help you, black.  There's no moyo here.  Any of circles would be reductions.

Triangle defends black's moyo, but I think it's too passive.]
;W[mj]C[N: good, close up the moyo.];B[mk];W[nk];B[lj];W[mi]
;B[li];W[ij]CR[mh]C[N: No white, continue to defend your moyo.

Circle is almost mandatory.  You've left too many weaknesses.]
(;B[hg];W[ml];B[lk];W[oo]C[N: good, continue the reduction]

;B[jd];W[id];B[je];W[kf]C[N: This just forces black to connect.  What's the gain for white?]
;B[jf];W[kc];B[lb];W[le]C[N: Again, it's forcing, but there's not profit.]
