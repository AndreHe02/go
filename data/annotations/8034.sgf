C[Please review for white.

It would be very nice if you could review for white. There are some questions in the sgf-file. Other comments are very welcome.  Thank you so much for your help.

[EV\] This is your reviewer.  Comments will be marked like this.  W got off to a good start, but then made an overplay (bad invasion) which lost the lead.  After that, W played a few slack moves, but there were no major mistakes in a mostly peaceful game.  I did add a few comments on technique, but those are not really very important.  You already realized the big problem with this game (the left side invasion), which is the most important lesson to study.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[qd];W[cp];B[ep];W[hp];B[dn]C[[EV\] This move does not appear in joseki books (except to note that it is bad), because of the W continuation ...]
;W[eo];B[do];W[dp];B[fo];W[eq];B[fp]C[[EV\] B should just capture, eliminating the ladder aji.]
;W[fq];B[bo];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[en]C[Is it bad for white to use the ladder now? Should he wait?

[EV\] This is a good fight for W, but it will be difficult for both sides.]

(;W[jp]TR[ck]C[What do you think of this move? Looking back on it, I feel I am very slow (pushing from behind) and maybe white should omit this move and play on the right side instead. If this is correct, what is white`s best move on this side?

[EV\] Pushing from below is the wrong direction, strengthening the weak B group above (assuming B answers).  Your suggested move (C9) looks very strong (but see some of the comments in those variations).  You have to read a bit, to make sure you can handle a B cut, but that fight looks OK for W.  If B answers submissively, crawling along the second line, W would be very happy.]

(;W[ci]C[I guess this is a bad move. I can live, but black get such a strong wall...

[EV\] This is a terrible move.  W has no need to be envious of the B left side territory, which is much smaller than the W bottom territory.  Lliving here will inevitably weaken the W center group, which is the focus of the game.  If W is not worried about making sabaki in the center, then extending to N5 is natural and good.]

;B[cc];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd];B[db];W[bi];B[di];W[jj]C[[EV\] Good, this is the vital point.  It goes a long way toward reducing the effectiveness of the B wall above.  (I was afraid W was going to invade deeply on top and get into more trouble.)]
;B[mo]
(;W[mp];B[np]
(;W[lp]TR[mq]C[I missread this. Maybe white should just play here?

[EV\] At this point, the hanging connection (M3), though painful, is probably best.]
;B[no];W[qn];B[kk]C[[EV\] This move seems a little slow.  W gains more than B from a pushing fight along this border.]
;W[kj];B[lj];W[li];B[mi]
(;W[ki]C[[EV\] Same mistake as M4.  The hanging connection is better, and fighting back (see variation) is better still.]
;B[pm];W[mh];B[ni];W[nh];B[oi];W[oh]C[[EV\] W got a good result with the first two pushes, but this one and the next risk a B tenuki.  R7 instead is huge and probably sente.  Switching to a large move on top is also good -- getting the first play there is important.]
;B[pi]
(;W[ph];B[lc]C[I presume this is far to good for black.];W[md]
;B[jd];W[qf]C[[EV\] This is a meaningless move, almost a pass.  It does not make W territory or reduce B territory or attack or defend anything.]
;B[nb];W[qm]C[[EV\] Good, huge move.];B[pn];W[po];B[ql];W[if]
C[[EV\] W is now strong in the center, so pushing B lower with the shoulder hit at J15 seems playable.]
;B[he];W[bp]LB[hf:A][ge:B]C[[EV\] The AB exchange is large and looks like sente for W, so I would take it immediately.

[EV\] No further comments on the endgame.];B[ek];W[dm];B[cn]

(;W[jc]C[Maybe white should play something like this?

Yes, somewhere around here is much larger than the game move.]
))
(;W[mj];B[lk];W[lh]C[[EV\] W should fight to avoid the submissive empty triangle connection in the game.  B cannot cut directly at L11, and it will be hard for B to peep profitably at K12 before capturing N10.]

(;B[mr]C[[EV\] B will hane here, emphasizing the W liberty shortage.  I don't think W can kill B after this.]
)))
(;W[mq];B[mp];W[lq]C[[EV\] This technique is worth learing.  B cannot hane at O3, and still has a cut at N6 to defend, so W gets a better result than the game or the other variations you considered.]

(;W[jj]C[[EV\] This looks like the vital point for strengthening the W center.]
(;B[kk];W[kj];B[lk];W[lj];B[mk]C[[EV\] This exchange would be great for W.  The center group is now strong, and the B center is over-concentrated.]
)
(;B[mo];W[mq];B[mp];W[lq]C[[EV\] Maybe B can force a few times like this, but he still has to defend the cut at N6, so W will get sente to play on top.]

(;W[ck]
(;B[dl];W[dk];B[ek];W[fl]LB[ej:A][fk:B]C[[EV\] As a matter of technique, W should atari at E10 first, exchanging AB before connecting here with better shape.  This fight looks fine for W.]
)
(;B[bk];W[cj]C[[EV\] This would be a bit of an overplay.  W can just draw back to D9 and let B defend in gote.  This way leaves the aji of a dangerous B cut.]
