AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hello to whoever is reviewing, and thank you in advance.  I feel like I did fairly well during this game but I lost in the end due to a dumb mistake caused by playing too fast and not looking.  Anyway, I was hoping to get advice for general opening and joseki, as well as points that I could work on in my game.]

(;B[pj];W[df]C[Whites placement here creates the foundation for a large framework. However, it's your move.]

(;B[jp];W[jc]C[White develops his framework with the biggest move for it. His development is still slow.]
;B[qq]LB[ec:D][db:C][cc:B][hc:A][mc:2][dm:1]C[Johnny5: Not sure if this was a good move.  I was hoping to make my corner very secure.

This move is slow. it isn't bad, but it doesnt have much spirit. Considering all your stones are on the 4th line, I'll mark off some suggestions.

1 - now white must approach a corner. 1 threatens to develop a huge moyo growing from the bottom upwards.

2 - this move is maybe a bit slow, but it prevents an approach at R14 from being very effective (leaving white with only C6 as an effective approach move). It also aims at invading around A & making probing moves around the top left corner stone more effective. Plus the top right becomes closer to territory (although R17 lives, white won't play there, it will give too much power to you)]

C[You may analyze the correct move to blunt white's potential by measuring along the square marked and triangle marked line. White's expansion on the top would create a baseline for a 6 line high moyo, while an expansion on the left side would only allow for development 4 lines high. K17 is the right move to prevent white from creating a framework. It isn't the only good move at this point, but it is easy to understand and aims at foiling white's plan.]
))
(;B[de]C[Assymetrical corner approaches are generally larger than sides. My favourite fusekis often involve taking a side rather than approaching a corner, but in a handicap game with 3 stones i would recommend this approach.

Q10 is a high stone, oriented towards power, not territory... D15 is the same way. Q10 links the right side into a cohesive framework, but D15 both pushes white low in top left and builds power towards D4. If white breaks into a complicated pincer, you can be assured that the result should be good for you with D4 in place. This is only a stylistic suggestion. You might like to try R10 or K3 instead to focus on territory rather than power.]
