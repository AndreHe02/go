;B[pd]C[>Hello
>Thanks for reviewing this game

>Many thanks for your comments
>palkarg

Hiya,

glad to review.  hope it helps.

general overview...I reviewed for black, but the commentary applies to white as well, sicne both players played very similarly.  Both players played generally rather slow and solid.  No major blunders of huge proportion, but a consistant misperception of the correct direction of play, a lack of severe punishing slack moves, and a few too many slow moves to protect non-urgent cuts are the major things that can be worked on by both players.  that said, for a 12k-14k game, it is very good.  niether player is leaving gaping weaknesses, and not even missing big moves too often.  good job.  if you have more quesiton, feel free to email me and I'd be happy to discuss them.

thanks
ryan

C[I really want this move to be around k16 area for some reason.  that just seems right to me.  but this is also fine.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[jq]C[right.  correct distance from f3 I think, l3 is a little more severe, but I like this.]
;B[po]C[> is it the proper way to respond ?

yup, it's the move I would have made.  m3 is also possible, but would be really timid.  only used when white is already strong on the right side.

> Many players tend to answer like white k3 or l3 rather than q6.

right, playing Q6 for while would have been a mistake.  black would get to settle your group easily, and there is no excuse for white making P3 if he's going to allow black to settle his stones easily]
;W[qp]
(;B[qo]C[I believe p5 is better here.  you are going to have to make it anyway, and r5 doesn't really confine white to the corner if you answer s5 with p5.]
;W[ro];B[op]C[ehh, don't like this so much as p5.  leaves the threat of the cut at p5, and yea, it's kinda sente...but crude]
;W[pq]C[no aji in the corner now, and a potential cut for white to aim at....not terrible, but not so good]
;B[pl];W[qn]C[why exactly white wants to make black stronger here I don't know.  no aji for the cut at p5 left, and the territory white gets is very small.]
;B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[ql];B[jc]C[good.  j17/16 is maybe a little more natural, but this is close enough.]
;W[pk]C[totally unnecessary.]
(;B[ph]C[> 4th line because I was interested by the moyo. Too far, should have played Q13 instead ?

hrmmm...  if you were interested in the moyo, k7 should have been on the fourth line.  since it is low, to be consistant I believe q12 should also be low at r13.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[I think this is the wrong direction, see variations.  it is an okay move in other circumstances, but here it is being way too easy on white.  black should be more severe, make him pay for his error in judging the correct direction of play by making r14.]

(;W[qc]C[this doesn't make sense to me at all.  no reason for white to duck into the corner.]

(;B[pc]C[> Which way should I cut?
> I went for territory as the left side K-Q17 seemed bigger than Q16-Q12.
> What is the rule to answer the 3-3 invasion?

you have the rule correct, go for the bigger territory, but in this case I think the other side is better because of the help you get from o16.  here again, black can punish white's terrible sense of direction, but black lets him get away with robbery.  this move is what white hopes for when he makes r17.  black is a little overconcentrated towards the left now]

(;B[oi]C[seeing this move hurts me.  very slow.  what is black worried about, a cut at p12?  see k14 variation.]
;W[qh]C[and exactly what is white worried about with this move?  connecting 2 alive groups?  not even a good endgame point...]

(;B[fc]C[good.  I'd have gone for the other marked points, but this is the right idea at least.  you have an insanely strong wall on the right, use it!  play high.]
;W[cf];B[df]C[natural move I think.  can't seem to find anything obviously better]
;W[ch]
(;B[ci]C[err, bad bad bad.  look at all that blackness in the middle, keep white on the side and make the center all black.  white is handing it over without a fight.]

;W[di]C[what is this move?]

c4 would have been okay.  I probably would have jumped into the corner and tried to live on both sides if he blocks at c4, but I'm not sure that I can reccomend that to you :)]

this is a close one.  r2 looks like about 30 points to me, b2 about 25.  just make your best guess and go with it =)]
