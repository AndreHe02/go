this.];W[np]
(;B[jr]C[not sure about this move

-> This move is not very good, see variation];W[pn]C[woiuld B:P5 have been a good response here, especially in view
of how this corner developed later?

-> It would have been better, I will go over a few options]

(;B[mq];W[qq]

for a complicated fight. Look at my alternative.

with white as the only winner.];W[qp]
(;B[po]C[B:s10 would have been better to prevent W from building a wall

-> You seem to like moves like S10, K2, B10 and K18. I don't
believe I have ever played them except for in defensive moves.
I don't believe those moves are good.

-> Look at my alternative.];W[qo]

back a few moves.]

(;B[ln]C[perhaps better would have been to invade at C or D6?

-> Yes, look at variations. There are many moves more important.

-> This is you third big misstake. It is a very small move. Anything
else on the board is more urgent.];W[dn]C[-> White is now the one getting all the territory. You need to
decide how to get it back. Your chance is in the upper left and
in the center.]
(;B[pl]C[that was pointless

-> Yes, look at variations];W[lo];B[jo]C[-> This is pointles as well. You need larger moves.]

for you. You need desperate invasions soon.

(;B[ng]C[now trying to develop the upper right corner

bigger.];W[rg];B[rf];W[sf];B[rh];W[sh];B[qg];W[sg]

stones anyway. Look at alternative.];W[re];B[sd];W[rd];B[rc]

his territoy all the time, but you are not.]

good.]
(;B[om]C[-> Wrong side to defend. Defend the whole center instead of two
stones. Look at alternative.];W[ok];B[mc]C[-> Too small.];W[qe]
;B[pe];W[of];B[ne];W[pf];B[nf]C[P16 instead, considering that P14 formation doesn't seem to be
much of a real threat?

I think O14 is a good move.];W[oe];B[od];W[pd];B[og];W[qc];B[pg]
;W[rb];B[qd];W[pe]
(;B[qc]C[-> Why did you stop an atari like this. The whole white group
was to kill. See alternative.];W[mk]C[-> Now your center is lost as well. You don't have any areas
to gain territory to compensate for whites  left side.

the game is really lost here.];B[jg];W[kk];B[ik];W[gm];B[ji]

(;B[hp]C[was this move necessary to keep this group alive? I thought I
had two false eyes, one at J5 and one at K6 and that this was
needed to get two valid eyes.

-> No it is not. There is no way for white to kill you. I will
go over the options.];W[gj];B[fj];W[gi];B[hi];W[gh];B[el];W[em]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[dk];W[dl];B[cl];W[ek];B[dm];W[cm];B[nc]C[should have played B:E8

;B[kh];W[ki];B[jh];W[ig]C[Somewhere around here is where I should have started an invasion
of the upper left corner.

started.];B[jj];W[jf];B[kf];W[id];B[je];W[if]
(;B[ke]C[now it's too late to invade, I think.

;W[mh];B[mg];W[hd]C[-> After this there were a few more moves for you. See continuation.]
;B[is];W[ks];B[rj];W[rk];B[sj];W[sk];B[si]C[-> You would still have lost by 89.5 points, which is a tough
defeat. You only have the upper right corner and white have the
rest of the board.

The main reason for this is that you play too defensive. The
other reason is that you play very local moves sometimes (worth
1-4 points) instead of looking at the whole board. I think the
third reason is that you ended up in a game where you didn't
see whites domination on the left side until it was too late.
In some games you make that type of misstake.

If you walk through the whole game. I can't see that you put
enough pressure on white. There are very few moves white had
to make based on your moves.

I have pointed out the worst misstakes in the game for  you.]
