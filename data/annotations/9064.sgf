All of them are fine. B and C build territory on the left while A should lead to a better position for the black on the top (together with Q17). See my variation at move 15.]

(;B[dc]C[I don't think this is a good move. Pincer G16 was an attacking move, you want to make white run. But now you switched to making territory in the corner and you also weaken G16 stone.]

(;W[pn]C[this position W has e lower side has big terriorty . I couldn't  reduce white 's terriorty .

Yes, but white had more stones at the bottom to begin with. Also, bottom is white's ONLY area of influence whereas you are doing fine in two corners, on the left and also have influence on the top. Don't be greedy. You don't have to win by the margin of 100 points, let your opponent have something too ;)]

(;B[lp]
(;W[jq];B[pl]C[What is this? Are you trying to attack white? Why not just R3 to settle comfortably.

I think all of your moves in this area follow the same pattern of not allowing white to have any points at all (or perhaps you just haven't evaluated the global board position and counted the points). Really, try to let go of that feeling, it will make you a stronger player.]

What follows is mostly endgame, so this is my last comment. I'll try to give you some summary of what I find lacking in your play.


I can see two main problems. The first one was seen in the beginning where you were obsessed with not letting white have any territory. This is never good. One should rationaly try to judge how many points both sides have, as well as to think about who has more influence and only based on that decide whether it's worth creating some deep invasion, weak groups and so on. In this game you had a comfortable situation in the beginning, so you should play solidly and calmly and let your opponent have points that are rightfully his.

The second issue is with finding the best moves. Arguably this is not easy for anyone but at the very least you should not play moves that are almost like pass and serve no purpose. I can't emphasize this enough: always try to find a purpose. Pro players' moves often serve as many as 5 purposes at the same time: they attack and defend, make points, make the situation worse for the opponent, create ko threats, prepare for future continuations, etc. You don't need to make brilliant moves like them, you are not a pro. But always ask your self: can I attack something? Can some of my groups be attacked? Which move gives me most points? Don't just randomly put down the stone. Related to this is the advice: don't follow your opponent around. Remember that he also plays many bad moves, so you don't need to answer all of them. Try to look all over the board to find a best continuation.

So, that's about it. I hope my review helps you a bit and good luck in your next games!]
