 impeccab1e 5k+: 123 gl hf];W[dq];B[pc];W[cd]LB[ed:A]C[unusual because A is very good for black now]
;B[qi]C[better to approach top left corner. but maybe you like this...]
;W[ec]C[this is really pleasant move for white.

the chinese opening looks to make a framework on the top and right - this move will help reduce that framework]

this isn't a huge mistake.. its just a bad habit.];W[or];B[np]

(;W[mq]C[this looks wrong];B[mp];W[pj]LB[rq:A]TR[qk][ql][qm]
C[was not entirely sure how to respond, could have gone under possibly

--
this move is not good.
white is playing to reduce marked area... but marked area isnt big because white has A.

so you should just let him destroy the triangle area and build moyo in the top right white keeping white weak.

you have to keep in mind that you have a cutting point at M4 though.]
;B[pi]C[this is very very good for you! 

:)];W[oj]TR[qe][qf]C[triangle area looking nice for black]
(;B[pl]LB[qe:B][nh:D][qm:C][rq:A]C[i think this is the wrong direction  because of white A -- the B area is more important than the C area -- so i think you should play around D to build that top right. see var.]
;W[qj]LB[pl:A]TR[pi][qi]C[the marked stones look pretty strange now -- and white can settle by pressing against A stone.

the relationship of A to the marked stones is a classic example of broken shape]

(;B[pe]C[a safe move but not ambitious enough and it ignores the main battle. see var]
;W[oi]C[nice for white];B[pg]
(;W[cl];B[cg];W[do]
(;B[jc]LB[lp:A]C[was not entirely sure whether i should have gone for the bottom or the top, i decided to pick the top. maybe i should ve went 4th line but then h17 would be really effective against it. White has a group with no base so i probably should have done something about it but i wasn't really sure what.

--

this is ok but i think bottom would be better because of your cutting point at A]
;W[ld]C[--
this is does not look good. now white has two groups floating.

from here you should focus on keeping white groups separate and attacking.]

(;B[lc]C[this is a bit passive
--
i put some other ideas as var
the idea is that you don't want to get pushed around by white -- don't do what white wants -- make a plan to resist/attack.]

;W[me];B[nd];W[jd]
(;B[ic];W[ng]C[Even though i got lots of area , i feel like this exchange was pretty average since he fixed his weak group, maybe i should have played around tengen now to stop any development in the centre

---

you got lots of points but yes i think it would be better to separate white groups --]
;B[id];W[jf]
(;B[mj]C[This move felt like really big overplay, probably biggest mistake of the game

--
this is not overplay... but is not a good move either. i think you need to play on bottom side
don't worry about center -- very hard for white to make any points there --]
;W[ol]C[interesting];B[oh]LB[ol:A]C[this is too early -- 

there is a saying: "it's pointless to cut two live groups"

because of A white can almost live there and his other side looks pretty strong... so this cut is early]

(;B[rl]C[see variation for better shape for connection];W[rm]
;B[rj]LB[qf:A][ri:B]C[there is aji around A B area.];W[mm]LB[nm:A]
C[These exchanges were really bad for black, i think it was all becuase of that n10 move, splitting the 2 groups didn't really do much

--
yes, you kind of started a fight over nothing -- this is not a great position for black -- but white has weeknesses... and this last move of his was really bad! he should play solidly at A to keep his groups connected]
;B[lr];W[nr]
(;B[ln]C[you don't want to push against white weak group];W[lm]
;B[hq];W[kp];B[lp];W[kn]C[pleasant for white]
(;B[ko]LB[ln:A]C[this is a bad exchange for black -- you get nothing but white gets stronger in the center.

you have more interesting options like starting a fight (see var) -- but once you play this exchange the center is stronger.

notice here that A is not a very important stone now -- and white can't event take it if he wants to-- don't waste time protecting it -]

(;B[jq]C[wrong shape here];W[jm]
