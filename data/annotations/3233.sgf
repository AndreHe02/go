C[Hi, thank you for reviewing !
Can you help me in life-and-death matters, how to kill small groups, how to achieve sabaki, when to ask one's self  "can he kill me here ?", and how to respond best to invasion ?
Also, my endgame is not good at all (but it is hard to read everything in byo-yomi), so maybe you can highlights mistakes there.
Also, feel free to add any kind of comments, like white's mistakes as well.
Thanks again.

n - Hi jean-michel!  I will do my best for you.  Of course I am just a slightly more advanced beginner.

My main suggestion is, look out for basic shape moves, I will highlight a few you missed.  And remember the proverb: "Play away from strength".]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[do]C[Waht kind of approach moves are possible against the 5-4 stone ? Where do they lead to ?

n - The 5-4 opening emphasizes the middle and the side.  Check out the joseki tutor at http://www.turbogo.com/text/jostutor.html, this is a very useful tool.]
;B[oc]LB[ce:A]C[n - I would prefer A, this seems a little flat.]
;W[de];B[fd];W[dh];B[pj];W[jp];B[qn];W[nq];B[fq]LB[dq:B][eq:A]
C[n - A may be better here.  You give W good shape at B.];W[dq]
;B[iq];W[jq]C[n - You are in a narrow spot here, you must make life.]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[ho]LB[jr:A]C[n - You cannot go here now, you must protect your stone at A.  (Basic shape move.)]
;W[ip]LB[ir:A]C[A is better.];B[hq];W[hp];B[gp];W[go];B[fo]
;W[gn];B[is]LB[fn:B][is:A]C[I thought I've achieved life here, but i this last move seemed a mistake.
Could you comment on this sequence here. How could I have achieved a living form ? Was a better result possible ? Can I keep sente to play K17 ?
n - Not at all.  Your group will die.  I might push one more time at B, but moves like A are crucial.  They are the key to shape.  The simplest moves are often the best.  You must never play away when you can make an eye for a weak group with one move!]
;W[fn];B[jc]LB[gr:A]C[n - K17 is not urgent.  You must save your group first.

Territorial moves are always smaller than life-saving moves.  A is a basic shape move here.]
;W[gr]LB[kq:B][er:A]TR[lr]C[It is dead now, I can't see an escape way.
I thought there might be a ko if I play L1, but "there are no ko threats in the beginning".
Besides, L3 seems interesting. Is it a true tesuji or an overplay ? [see variation\]

n - W responds at M2]
(;B[er];W[hr]LB[gq:A]C[Do I gain anything if I push at D2 ?

n - Still dead, see var.]
(;B[gq];W[dr];B[eo];W[en];B[dn];W[co];B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W[pq]
;B[qr]LB[rq:C][pr:D][qr:B][rr:A]C[R2 seems a mistake, it should be at R5, shouldn't it ?

n - The standard answer is A, followed by B and C.  The cut at D is gote and waits until the endgame.]

(;W[pr]C[Same mistake from White I guess, should be at S5.
If White S5 here, how does Black live ?

n - See var (off previous move).];B[qo];W[dm];B[nn];W[ko];B[in]
;W[hn]LB[km:A]C[n - Wrong direction.  W should play A or something similar.  He is too worried about weak black stones.]
;B[ce];W[cd]LB[dd:B][cf:A]C[I see two continuations from the cut at D16 [see variations\].

n - You should cut and play the first variation, I think.  But you can play A instead.]

(;B[cf]C[n - You are behind, this may be a way to mix it up and catch up.]
;W[dd]
(;B[cc]LB[df:A]C[n - No, it's too late for this move.  In Go you must choose a path and stick with it.  Play A, see var.]
;W[bd];B[df]C[n - Too late...];W[fe];B[ge];W[ef];B[ch];W[ci]
;B[di]
(;W[cg]C[n - Wrong way, this move makes B stronger.  See var on prev move.]
;B[dg];W[eh];B[eg];W[fg]LB[cg:A]C[n - Take the stone, you will have ko.]

(;B[fh];W[bh];B[ei];W[ch];B[gg];W[ff];B[gf];W[ee];B[gi]LB[ec:B]
[pg:A][im:C]C[After the game, white talked about reducing startng at J7.
How can black handle that move ?
(actually, I would prefer L8, what would be your best move ?)

W has a good lead, he just needs to make life in the middle to win.  He can relax and play safely.  I would probably start with A.  B is another very interesting move.  C is much too close to W's strength, that is a 2-point move.]

(;W[dj];B[km];W[ej];B[fj];W[jn]C[n - Another terribly small move.]
;B[im];W[jm]LB[im:D][jm:B][km:A][in:E][jn:C][ho:F]C[n - Why are you guys playing over here?  This is not where the action is.  If any or all of the marked stones disappeared, the score would be almost exactly the same.]
;B[jl];W[il];B[hl];W[ik];B[hm];W[jk];B[kl]C[n - Same situation, more stones.]
;W[kk];B[io]C[n - suicide.];W[gk]C[I missread the fight here, I forgot that L4 would be atari.]
;B[fk];W[gl];B[jo];W[kn];B[kp];W[kq]C[Here, I thought about resigning.

n - A good time for it.];B[lp];W[ln];B[mn];W[ll];B[lr];W[ir]
LB[hk:A]C[This is white's mistake, isn't it ?

n - Yes, you were clever to start a ko here.  He should have  played A, but it was a very natural mistake.]
;B[ks];W[js];B[lo];W[ls];B[lm];W[lq]C[n - B now can regain the initiative.]
;B[fl]C[n ...a 2-pt move];W[hk];B[cn];W[bn];B[gm];W[hh];B[em]
;W[cm];B[fm];W[dn];B[hi];W[ii]LB[pg:C][lh:A][ph:B]C[n - Wrong direction.  W must play to sacrifice his center group.  Some possibilities marked.  "Never play towards strength".]
;B[ki];W[rj]LB[qh:A]C[How should black handle this invasion ?

n - I would probably play A.  But your move is fine.];B[qj]
;W[rl]LB[ri:A][rl:B]C[Should black defend at S7 or at S11 ?

S11.  W is dead.  B must be at A.];B[rm]C[n - By attaching you strength W.  You bring his invasion back to life. :)]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[ql];B[ri];W[oj]C[n - ???];B[mj]C[n- good shape.]
;W[lj];B[li];W[mi];B[nk];W[nj];B[mk];W[ok];B[qh];W[ji]LB[mc:A]
[mg:B]C[n - This is what my old boss called "rearranging deck chairs on the ship Titanic".  After this point, I can't see any way for W to live.  Maybe by sacrificing all these stones and living small in the middle, starting with something like A  or B.]
;B[kg];W[jg];B[kj]C[L10 seems a bad move.

n - Yes, but it's too late for W.];W[mh];B[lg];W[oh];B[ph]C[Q12 as well.

n - This one I like.];W[of];B[ng];W[mg];B[og];W[pg];B[pf];W[lk]
;B[nl];W[nf];B[qg];W[ke];B[le];W[nh]TR[le][kg][lg][ki][li][kj]
C[Instaed of O12, I think white should be able to capture the marked stones because black didn't defended them well.
Is that right ?

n - I don't think so.  Seems to me they are fine, and W is in big trouble.  The black group cannot be killed, and as far as I can see, W cannot live on either side.  Has been dead for a while in fact.]
;B[ld];W[lh];B[kh];W[lf];B[kf];W[mf];B[jf];W[gh];B[fi];W[gd]

(;B[if]C[G16 seemed a threat. But now that I am no more in byo yomi, I think there's nothing to be afraid of, and black can defend at G17 or G16.
Can you read that ?

n - I think your move is good, see var.];W[fc];B[hd];W[gc];B[hc]

;W[lc];B[kd];W[kc];B[jd]C[K16 doesn't seem necessary.

n - Hm.  It certainly can't hurt.  After you kill a big group, my advice is, just do whatever it takes to make sure it stays dead :)]
;W[oi];B[ck];W[ek]C[D8 was the right play here.

n - Yes.];B[cj];W[dl];B[bc]C[Can those three stones live in the corner ?

Can black kill this small group ?

n - Sure.  Remember that the big W group is dead.  Just play A, followed by white B and black C.  So it can connect, it just can't make another eye.]
;B[mc]LB[ha:A]C[n - Wrong way.  W can play A for ko now.];W[mb]
;B[kb]C[I think this is the mistake, should be at J18 right ?
