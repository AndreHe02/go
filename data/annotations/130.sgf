(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[The critical problem I see for you is  playing your stones against each  other.  You really lost in the fuseki, even though it wasn't official until  white's capture on the left side.

It is a small difference.  Even a professional would say the jump is  playable... but you would rarely see it in a high-level game.]

;B[rk];W[rh]C[r9 is a terrible move.  You must play r8 instead at least.

In fact, tenuki is even ok.

playing t10 is the optimal move here. white has no real ko threats at this  stage and is likely to connect.

r9 is bad shape.  r8 makes the hane at t9 gote, and gives you more eyeshape  and a better connection with q6.    but t10 is better yet because of it's effect on *white's* eyeshape.]

[ro][qm]TW[sh][si][ri][lr][mr][nr][os][ns][ms][ls]C[white is already  alive, and in sente.  you didn't get the most value from your moyo.    Look at the stones in your area.  Everybody is settled, so it's just a matter  of territory.  You've got only three points more even though you played the  first 3 stones in the area.    Now you've got those 3 stones up top, but they aren't making territory.  they  are in an attacking position.  Given that there is nothing there for them to  attack, you'd prefer them to be in a different configuration  (r17,o17  instead of r15,o16)  this d
rawback is worth much more than the 3 points.

Ask yourself, which do you prefer, your 4 stones on the top side?  or white's  2 4-4 stones plus the move?

White is leading.  I would be very confident against an equal player with  white in this game.]
V[6];W[lc]C[n17 is a bad move.  It aims at the corner territory which you  need one more move to take.  Better to  connect your stones with m16.  If white's other group were weaker you could  attack strongly with o14 or n15, but this won't have enough effect on white  here.

playing n17 causes what Otake calls a family feud.  What you do to help the  three stones in the corner is countered by how much weaker you are making  k16.]

(;B[mc];W[ld];B[nf]C[Again o14 doesn't  have enough effect on white's group.  m14, which it provokes, is worth much  more.  Look at the moyo white is starting to build in the top left.  And note  that your stone at k16 can no lo
nger see any of its friends.  it is surrounded.];W[lf];B[rf];W[rg];B[re]

White should probably answer this though.]

C[ok.  everybody is safe, let's count the score.

Even assuming white get's *nothing* from his groups in the bottom left, he is  ahead by 18.    Did you realize this during the game?  Developing a feel for where you stand  is important.

Even at our level this is a hopelessly lost game.     The key to this game was the fighting in the center top.  You played moves to  weaken k16, and then trying to save k16 weakened everything else.

The rest was just tactics.

Avoid letting your stones get surrounded... when they do, play on weaknesses  to help them.  the *last* thing you want to do is let your opponent build a  loose net around your stones, and then force him to fix all his weaknesses.    But this is exactly what you did to/with k16.]
