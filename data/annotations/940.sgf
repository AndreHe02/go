[dm:C][bo:D]C[This is not joseki (the Joseki moves are A-D). I think it is because this put just light pressure on the markes stone  and none on the other one.]
;W[co]C[Good. White will take the corner if not attacked by Black.]

(;B[cp]C[I don't think this is correct. As seen later, white has a great corner and black will not have strong influence on the outside so the exchange is in favor of white. A possible alternative is to play at the hoshi (see variation).]
;W[dp];B[cn];W[bo];B[dn];W[bn];B[dm]C[As already said, the black shape is not good, and white has a big corner and sente.]
;W[mq]LB[qp:A][po:B][pq:C]C[This is a wrong approach of the corner. the Joseki are A, B and C. However in this case, I think that A and C would give to too much black influence  in the direction of the left giving some legitimity to the "bad" exchange on the left corner.]

(;B[mp]LB[qp:A]C[I would prefer to play in the corner at A as white let it to you.]
;W[lp];B[mo]LB[np:A]C[better to extend at A.];W[nq];B[op];W[np]
;B[no];W[oo];B[po];W[on];B[pn];W[om];B[pm]LB[lo:A][qp:B]C[Play first on the other side at A. or protect the corner at B.]
;W[lo];B[ol];W[mn];B[nm]LB[pc:A]C[This is too soon and gote. You should be very happy with the result (before this move) you have a big corner (but you still have to add a move to secure it completely) and white shape is overconcentrated.

Use the initiative to take much bigger points like playing a shimari in the upper right (A), attacking the upper left or  doing something for your weak group on the bottom left.]
;W[nn];B[nl];W[gq]C[Correct.];B[cl];W[bm];B[hp];W[gp];B[go]

LB[dh:A][io:B]C[This seems good at first sight. But black still has too much weaknesses so I think it is necessary to first reinforce one of the groups at A or B]
;W[df]C[This is a good move.];B[dg];W[ef]LB[ce:A]C[White should keep the preasure on the black group, for example at A]
;B[ce];W[ed];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[jd];W[hd];B[hc];W[bb]
MA[hd]C[Strange. White should be consistent and do something with the marked stone, otherwise he should not have played it.]
;B[ph]MA[jd]LB[pc:A]C[Play in the corner before the side. The shimari at A is better and works well with the marked stone.]
;W[pc];B[nd];W[nb];B[qc];W[qb];B[qd];W[mc]LB[md:A][he:B]C[This exchange seems in favour of black, and would be clearly for black if he adds a stone at A or reinforcing at B instead of playing elsewhere.]
;B[kq]LB[in:A]C[Ouch. If black plays there he has to make something for the weakness and play at A.]
;W[in];B[kn]LB[io:A]C[??Bad Move.
It is still time to protect at A];W[ho];B[io];W[hn];B[jn];W[hl]
;B[lm];W[or];B[pr];W[ns];B[pq];W[qj]C[Too deep. Considering how strong Black is here, it will be very difficult to live or to escape.]

(;B[qi];W[nj];B[rj]LB[mi:A]C[NO, NO, NO. White is now happy to escape without much damage. A is better. White escape but black will be very strong and extend his moyo.]
