(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[Hello.  My name is Bill Skees.  I played white in
this game.

After the first few moves I felt I was winning big.  Near the end of the
game I felt I was probably ahead by 30, but I only won by 10.  Clearly the
lower right was too big.  Where did I make the worst blunders?  Thanks,
Bill Skees

Hi, Bill. It seems that you outfought your opponent, and you didn't really
make big blunder, just some small
mistakes.]PW[wskees]WR[9k]PB[zoomie]BR[10k]KM[0.5]RE[W+10.5]DT[1995-05-01]
