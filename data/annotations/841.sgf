C[My initial reaction after playing throught the game once quickly is that white plays better technically whilst black makes some clear tactical mistakes. However white does not really have a plan and so cannot win the game.

Now that I have finished my review I would like to sumarise the key points here:

1) It is very important to have a plan, or at leat to try to make plans whilst you play.   You need to look at the board and see what is going on. Look at the moyos and look at the secure territory. Look at the weak groups and look at the thickness.

Think about some of the things that migh happen. Things like
* black might reduce/invade this moyo
* this white group might get attacked
* there is a vital point here that expands one moyo whilst reducing another
* there is a move here that turns this moyo into secure territory.
etc.

When you know some of the things that might happen then you can start to decide what the important things to do are.   This game developed into a game of moyos and territory. Black ended up taking lots of territory whilst white got a moyo. At one stage black chose to make a smallish increase in his territory in exchance for letting white make a large increase in his moyo. I think that this was questionable. After that White needed to come up with a plan to turn that moyo into territory but didn't and so lost any chance of winning the game.

All this sort of thing is very difficult. The importnat thing is to try. You will probably make mistakes, but they will be mistakes you can learn from.

2) Try to sort out where the important moves are - where the interesting areas of the board are.

There was a stage in this game (about moves 15- 20) when the right hand side was very important. Black had taken thickness in exchange for corner territory. The question was "Can black make good use of this thickness?" Instead or trying to answer this both players played smaller moves at the bottom.

Earlier in the game black played several smaller moves when bigger moves were available.

Tim Hunt.];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[iq]C[In this position there are three first rate moves: K16, (C10 or D10) and (Q10or R10). White plays first so one might expect white to get two of these good points and black to get one. These will all lead to reasonable games.]
;W[dj]C[So this is a good move.]
(;B[eo]C[I think that this move is smaller than either R10 or K16.

If black does not play a move in this area then there are basically two follow-up moves for white. Black can deal well with both of these moves (see the variations) and so there is no need for black to play another move round here.]

(;W[qn]C[Good. White goes on taking big points.

(You can ignore the rest of this if you wish)

If we look at the right hand side before this move is played there is an interesting question about order of moves.

On the right side the big move for either player is Q10 (or R10).

After Q10 has been played then there is a follow-up move that is fairly big.

For example if white plays Q10 then R6 is a big follow-up for white and R8 is a big follow-up for black. Furthermore, the white move at R6 is 'almost-sente' since it threatens to play at O3 (or nearby) next.

So when the sequence R6, O4, Q10 is played we see white making sure that he gets the good follow-up move. Sometimes this is OK for black. However by playing R6 first white gives black the chance to mix things up by playing a pincer or a contact move.

The variation may help to explain this.]
(;B[pn]C[This is an OK move.

There is nothing wrong with black playing the ordinary move at O4. In a sense you should have a good reason before you play anything else.

Here black wants to build up his moyo across the bottom. This move is one way to achieve it. Often a better option is to start with a pincer. That is what I would have done here. See the variation.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[qq]C[Good move by white.]
(;B[qo]C[This is the wrong direction by black.

Black wants to build up a framework across the bottom so black should play Q3. See the variation.]
;W[or];B[qm];W[mq]C[Where black should have had a framework white gets a settled group.

This is not necessarily disasterous. It is just that black does not seem to have any consistent plan in mind.]
;B[kq]C[This is a very small move. White shoud try to ignore it. Surely white can live with one more move, say by playing Q3. White can also run away into the centre. Since white has two ways to defend this group there is no harm in playing elsewhere. This group is safe enough for now.

(Black can probably attack white a little bit and take some of the corner territory, but that is quite small. Don't worry about it.)

In this position the imortant area is the right hand side. Black has a very high and strong position around Q6 and so black should extend all the way to R14 to make the most of it. This is also an excellent approach against the corner.

Likewise, it should be white's first priority to nullify black's thickness with a move like R14 or R13. ("Stay away from thickness" as the proverb goes.)]
;W[mo]C[This is not a good move.

Normally an important rule is "Don't let your groups get shut in." This is not relevant here because:

1) If black does shup white in then white can live with Q3 or something which make more than just the minimum 2 eyes worth of territory. Also black does not get outstanding thickness on the outside.

2) Black has almost 100% solid groups on both sides of white so this move does not have any chance of leading to a counter-attack in the future.

3) White is never going to make any territory in the middle here. Black was not likely to make much territory near here either, so this move is almost a dame (neutral) point.

4) White has slightly suspicious shape. Black is quite strong nearby so one day there might be a black tesuji to cut white.

As I said before, around R13 is the move.];B[ko];W[mm]C[This is another fairly feeble move.]
;B[om];W[pl]C[It fels too early to try pulling this stone out. There are lots of white options around here and there is no good reason to play any particular one now. Keep your options open. R13 is still the move.]
;B[ql];W[ol];B[qj];W[nm]C[White has just helped black make territory and has not got much in return.]
;B[qf];W[nd]
(;B[rd]C[This is OK for black but there is another option (see variation)]
;W[qc];B[ph]C[This is a good honest move. Of course black's stones could probably be working a little bit more efficiently round here.]
;W[jd]C[Good big move.

This is probably a good moment to stop and survey the situation.

White has about a 5-10 point group in the bottom right corner. White also has a large moyo across the top of the board. This is quite a loose, thin moyo.

Black has a good 20 point territory on the right side. Black also has an area in the lower left. This is quite close to being territory, perhaps 35 points.

So one way to look at the game is to say that white needs to make about 40 points of territory out of his moyo. I think I would prefer to be black, but it is still close.]

(;B[cl]C[I don't think that this is a great move. Sure, it expands the black area a bit, but it gives white a chance to expand his moyo too.

I think that if I was black I would leap into the middle of white's moyo with F17. Let's try this in a variation:]

(;W[cj]C[White does indeed expand his moyo, good.

Of course the really bold, large scale way of playing is white at E8.

When a stone on the 3rd line faces a stone on the 4th line like this then there are big follow-up moves in two different directions.

Both playes have a big move near the edge of the board. In this case black can slide to B10 and white can stop this with C10 (as in the game), or B10 or B9.

Both players also have a big move towards the centre at E8 or thereabouts. (Black might consider playing E9 and white might conisder playing E9 or D8 instead).

These are locally good moves. Which, if any, of them are important in a given position depends on the whole board.

In this game it is hard to say which is better. The game move aims at real territory on the left hand side. E8 aims at a very large moyo in the centre of the board, however this moyo is quite thin. Which way of playing you adopt is probably a matter of style. Let us have a look at E8 in a variation.]

(;B[el]C[This is bad. It is clear that white's next move helps white a lot more than this helps black.

As black I would invade at C14 instead see variation.];W[fj]
;B[gl]C[This move is also too slow.

Black may now have 60 points in the lower right to add to the 20 on the right hand side, but that is no good if white makes 100 points in the top right corner of the board.]
;W[km]C[This is also very small. As I was saying ...

... if white makes 100 points in the top right corner of the board.

Black has got 80 points in the bank. White needs to start securing some of the moyo as territory NOW.

Possible white moves are E17 and F16.];B[jm]C[Again small.

It is probably enough for black to inavde at the 3-3 point in the top left. That is another 10 point of black territory and after that it is hard to see how white can make enough territory to win.]
;W[jl];B[im];W[kn];B[jn]C[Yuck! Why make an empty triangle? normal shape is K5 instead.]
;W[ij]C[I still think that it is more important to prevent the 3-3 invasion in the top left corner.]
;B[fc]C[At last someone plays in the important area. My view is that white's only hope is to kill all the stones that black puts in this moyo, and I think that there is enough space for black to get something alive in here.]
;W[eb];B[cf]C[I quite like the way in which black scatters stones around during this sequence. The idea is to keep white guessing as to exactly where the black group is going to be.]
;W[df];B[de];W[ce];B[ee];W[cd];B[fg];W[cg];B[bf];W[dg];B[jc]
;W[ic];B[id];W[ib];B[hd];W[kd]C[This feels a bit passive. K15 is needed here since you are trying to kill.]
;B[if];W[hg];B[hf];W[gg];B[gf];W[fh];B[hc];W[hb];B[ig];W[ff]
;B[fe];W[eg];B[kf];W[nf]C[Here we get a very crude sequence by black over the next few moves. Watch what happens.]
;B[nh];W[mg]C[First black pushes white one way ...];B[lg];W[mh]
C[Then black pushes white back the other way.];B[lh];W[mi]C[The final result is that black is well and truly cut into two bits. White could not have achieved such a clean cut as this without black's help.]
;B[jh]C[The bad news is that what has been cut off is clearly alive and so basically that is game over.

I put black about 20 points ahead. Not much chance of getting that back in the endgame. White can probably resign.

End of comments.

(Well one more point. Anyone who thinks that black 139 is necessary should go and read chapter 1 of "Life and Death" again.)]

(;W[fd];B[ch]C[If white plays simply then the two white stones become a weak group. This should let black win easily.]
)
(;W[ch];B[fc]C[But it is quite hard to find a better response for white. Black gets a chance to break up the moyo in fine style.]
)))
(;W[el]C[It is difficult to say how black will play next. I think that the important question is what is going to happen to the white moyo. Black has many options for stopping it getting too big.

Black can move in gradually with moves around N12 and J8.

Black can play a reducing move at K18 which can connect out either downwards or rightwards.

Black can invade the corner at C17, D17 or C16.

Black can invade one of the larger gaps about F17 or C14. (Alternatively C12 or D12 is interesting because it just about threatens to link out to the stone at C8.)

Black has the tighter invasion at M16.

Black has the large endgame move at B10 to slide into the territory.

Of course black can't do all of this because some of these plans are not compatible with others. For example black can't invade at C17 and at F17. My feeling is that there is space for black to get away with 2 or 3 of these plans, and that should be enough to make it a close game.

For example see the variations, but almost anything could happen next.]

(;B[cc]C[The 3-3 invasion is quite simple.]
(;W[dc]C[White certainly blocks on this side.];B[cd];W[ce];B[be]
;W[cf]C[One should, of course, consider the double-hane variations as well.]
;B[bf];W[cg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc];B[jh]C[Then black probably just needs a gentle reducing sort of move in the middle. Hard to say exactly where a move like this should be played. It is very tempting to shut your eyes and then drop a stone at random onto the centre of the board and see where it ends up!

Black has threats to invade at M16 and to cut at E9 and O8 so the stone in the middle is likely to survive.

Some random speculation follows.];W[mh];B[jk];W[jm];B[km];W[jl]

The white moyo has been split into two halves, each of which appears to be about 20 points (remember that black can invade at C17 in sente if he plays it at the right time). This is about what white needed, but I think this is good enough for black. There are still chances to invade around D12 and M16.]

This next priority is porbably to break up black's formation a little bit before black finishes it off with K5.

White could play J5 or K5 which are relaxed reducing moves, and probably quite sufficient. Or white could try a light invasion like M4. Much later in the game there is the possibility of trying to put a live goup in the middle of black's territory near E3. This may or may not work and it is far too early to be thinking about that sort of rubbish now. It is a useful possibility because it means that we do not have to worry about the size of black's territory.]
