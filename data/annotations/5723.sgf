C[[Underpants\] I play white in this game. I won, but only by half a point. However, there are a couple of issues I am not entirely happy about. First, the handling of black's huge moyo in the upper right, which resulted in a huge black territory on the upper side. The other thing is I think I could (and should) have put more pressure on the black group in the lower side.

Thanks in advance for all your comments.

inimino: I will do my best to review.

In my opinion, your biggest mistake in this game was that you made some slow moves during the fuseki and gave your opponent too much time to build a very large moyo on the top side without sufficient compensation for white on the rest of the board.]
;B[pd];W[pp]C[Makara [3k\]: Have a good game.];B[dp];W[cc];B[qn]
;W[nq];B[rp];W[qq];B[qk]C[inimino: O17 would be my idea at this point.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[bp];B[jc];W[jq]TR[iq][kq]C[[Underpants\] I thought about the triangled points too

inimino: This is not urgent, the top black growing formation is.  However, on the bottom since b left off a move, an idea would be to play at H3 later.]
;B[cq];W[ck];B[ed];W[de];B[ee];W[df];B[fg]C[[Underpants\] So, now is where I really have to deal with black's framework, and I am not really sure how to.

I first thought about invading at R17, then reducing from the outside. I finally chose R14 thinking that the group below (triangled) would be pressed and have some troubles. Thinking back, I think I should have gone with R17.

inimino:  You needed to deal with it before, so now the situation is awkward.  R17 feels a little bad because w has low positions all over the board and b is very strong on both sides.  After R17 the thickness of b will dominate the rest of the game.  Black has the advantage here after the fuseki, in my opinion, but the game move was better than R17.]

(;B[hq]C[inimino: Your K3 was in a slightly awkward place perhaps but this b move is also a bit slow.  I wonder if S3 and putting a little pressure on the b side group would be best here.]

(;W[pl]C[inimino: I think w here needs to be thinking of reducing the potentially very large b top.  However, locally, this move is somewhat odd.]
;B[on];W[no];B[nm];W[ok];B[lm];W[lj];B[jf]C[inimino: Another slow move, but b had better potential on the top in my opinion.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[dj];B[ej];W[ek];B[fj];W[jm];B[kl];W[lh]C[inimino: It seems that black has some lead, although he made questionable moves in yose.  Most of the reduction of the b top was allowed by black, so I think w should have tried a little earlier to reduce.

No more comments after this point, the rest was just yose as you gradually took back the lead.]
