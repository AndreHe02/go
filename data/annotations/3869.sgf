C[ihgo : Hi,
that is my first game send to the GTL. Hope it will be a great source of knowledge.
I was black in this game.
As you will see in the game, I began several attacks but white escaped too easily and its influence on the bottom was too huge to come back.

May I ask you to insist on the following points :
- opening : i think the opening i played was unbalanced. I played only on top, i wish i found time to play on the bottom.
- attacking moves : i think my attacking moves at the beginning were too soft, could you give me alternatives.

Thanks,

Ismael

There is no problem in my opinion with black fuseki.  C10 is very natural move.]

(;W[qm]C[ihgo : At this point, i thought W R7 was very severe, i go on attacking the top white group, but it seems too kind since that group is not very weat whilst I am !

Yes, you should attack the w weak group.]
(;B[ni];W[mf];B[ld];W[kf];B[ol]C[ihgo : And my black group is now very weak, i need to make a living.

The best way to stabilize your group is to attack as shown before.  This move could be regarded as somewhat slow.]

This is a very vague move.  F17 would be a normal move here for b.  What J16 accomplishes I cannot guess.]

;W[sh];B[ef]C[ihgo : I was happy white made too weak groups to attack and separate. But I did not manage in this task.

There is only one weak group.  A move like E14 is a good idea, to attack while making points, but it is also a little loose.  F17 is still a good idea.]

This move shows a mistake of strategy.

You are trying to attack, but ignore your own weakness at J8 group which has no eyes and nowhere to run.  This move is a big mistake in my opinion.

Now if you follow by playing O3, you help your group.  But you still weaken J8 group.]

(;B[qn];W[pn];B[ql];W[rm];B[rl];W[gl]C[ihgo : Easy to say after seeing this move that i must have played there instead of S9, but I was not sure my right side group was alive.

This move is the biggest move of the game.  This move makes white feel very good.  This move leads directly to the next 30 moves... until move 98.  Next comment is at move 98.]

This is the result of letting white play first at G8.  So it is easy to see that now, this fight went very horrible for black.  It is already a very difficult game.  Points are close on board, but yose is all for white.  White can play F17 and it is impossible for b to win in my opinion.

So, loss of this game was due to a mistake of letting w start this fight.]
