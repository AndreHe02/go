AB[pd][dp]C[Hi jerhum, my name is Jonathan and I'll be reviewing your game. Since you won this game, there aren't too many things I can point to and say "see how this turned out badly?". Therefore, I've made some comments on specific situations throughout the game that will hopefully be helpful for you.]
;W[dd];B[pp]C[This is fine];W[cn];B[fq]C[This is fine];W[dj]
;B[co]TR[fc][nc][qf][pj][qn]C[This is terrible. If the D10 stone was black, then this move would be ok. Since white has the stone there, black C5 simply induces white to make a strong shape. (A general principle is to extend three spaces from a 2-stone wall, so the resulting shape is perfect for white.) In addition, after white D6, white can still play at C3 and either live in the corner or connect to C6 depending on Black's answer. Locally, B5 would be better than C5, but the two black stones (D4, F3) form a relatively stable shape so black should play somewhere else (I've marked some big points).]
(;W[dn];B[kq]TR[fc][qf][pj][qn][mq][nq]C[This feels awkward to me- L3 does not work well with F3 since both stones are low on the third line, and it doesn't work well with Q4 since they are far apart. The same marked points are better.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[qj]TR[pd][pf]SQ[co][dp][fq]C[The stones marked with triangles form a MUCH better shape than the stones marked with squares.]
;W[jj]TR[co][dp][fq][kq]C[The inefficiency of the marked stones resulted in white gaining sente and getting to play in the center. Even though black started off with two stones, white is catching up already.]
;B[qp]C[Ok];W[mq]
(;B[lp]C[The following sequence (through move 32 at Black J2 leaves black with a weak shape. Black tries to attack too closely and just forces white to separate the black groups, which requires black to play moves defending each group while white only has to take care of one group. See the variation for a different approach.]

;W[lr];B[kr];W[ks];B[js];W[ls];B[ir];W[pk];B[pi];W[oj];B[qk]
;W[pm];B[pn]C[The weak points left over from chasing the lower white group came back to hurt black. Try to avoid making the weak shape in the first place and it won't be a problem later.]
;W[ql];B[oi];W[nj];B[ni];W[mj];B[fd]C[Good idea. All of blacks groups are relatively stable, so now is a good time to break up white's framework before it gets too solid.]
;W[ec];B[fc];W[cf]C[This shape works for white since the K16 stone prevents black from making an ideal extension.]

(;B[ob];W[qb];B[qd]C[It's good you realized now that the right side was bigger. Too bad black didn't see this before P18. Even after Q17, black can switch to R16.]
;W[oc];B[rd];W[rl];B[rk];W[cq]C[See how this is still an option?]

;W[ca];B[ea];W[bb];B[ne]C[Great move! It expands black's group while limiting white's.]

;W[mm];B[je]C[Again, good move. White has played several moves that are not the largest moves, and one key to getting stronger is learning when to ignore your opponent's move.]

Neither side made any game-changing mistakes, so it was a deserved black victory. Hopefully these comments helped a little and gave you some things to think about. Good luck!]
