C[I thought I was ahead in this game but lost it in the endgame.  However, White made a big mistake or he would've won by a lot, so clearly there were problems earlier.

*: Hi, my name is Moe, or Shin(Online); all my comments will start with *:.  If you have questions on the review feel free to mail me back.

*: So under the 1st run through you made very few mistakes, it was hard game for me to review.  As you suspected you made more mistakes in end game then early game.

*: End game is very tricky, it is critical to think about sente; when you think there is no big moves (small then 10 points) left.  Stop, spend good 5-10 min looking at all options before going on with the game.  To figure out best plan of execution.

*: Don't be in a rush but also don't answer all of your opponents moves, take initative where you can afford to.]

(;B[jp]C[Was tenuki-ing good here?  I figured maximizing my  moyo was more important than the corner for the Chinese opening

*: I like R17, it's Honte.  Meaning Honst move, please look at other path.]
;W[qc]C[*: This does not look like it but it is a huge loss for you. So early in the game.]
;B[pc]C[*: Doesn't help you... either way white gets stronger and you don't gain much for your troubles the side is in somewhat ruines I would go with C6 right now.]
;W[ob];B[qd];W[rc];B[rd]MA[cn][cf][fq]C[*: Slow move, this is end game move, leaving S16 open seems scary.  Possible options are marked.

*: Moyo F3.
*: Fights C6, C14.];W[jd];B[cj]C[I think this may have been a mistake.  Now if I approach at F3, White's response will pressure this stone.

*: I like this move, I don't like to dive into Moyo.  So this goes with my playing style.]
;W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[pk]C[This seemed like overplay, but I wasn't sure what to do.  I thought about jumping in at Q7, but that looked very messy

*: This is not good move for him.  As you suggested Q7 would be nice move, or Q8.

Either way you want to play between them, attaching to make stronger is nice defense idea.  So by play Q7 you can foil his plans.]

(;B[on]SQ[cc][ne]C[For some reason I convinced myself white couldn't push through, but I was wrong

As for N7 it was good move but you can't really seal white in.  So corner invation is better choice.  Another move is O15.]

*: Lets take a quick count...

Black: Right (22) + Bottom (41) + Left (23) : Total (86)
White: Top (57) + Bottom (17) + Right (18) : Total (92)

So I would say white is a bit ahead of you right now, but it is close enough that you should go all you can get before late end game.  E3 as pointed out will be huge win for you...

(;B[kg]CR[gq][eq]TR[ap][kd][if][mc]C[*: Gote, it is worth about 6 points. YOu can do much more then that.  you just got sente you use it. Following moves are Sente: A4, J14, L16, N17.  Lets see how much you would get out of each..

A4: You play first, you get 0 points.  But white loses 2 points.
White plays first, white gets 2 points, it is reverse-sente for him so you are forced to play A5 in gote or lose 1 point (so we'll count that as half point.  Total 4.5 point difference, sente means x2 so 9 Points for Black and and 4.5 Points for white.

J14: You play, you gain 0 points, white loses 1 point.
Play plays he gains 1 point, you lose nothing.  It is pure gote for white; so this is big sente for you.  So 4 Points for you, 2 points for white.

L16: You play White loses 1, you gain 1.  White plays you lose 1, White gains 1.  Double-Sente; who ever plays first gains. 8 points for either side.

N17: You play first, white Loses 1, you gain 0.  White plays you lose 0, white gains 1 (reverse sente for him with no gain but to prevent a lose).  so 4 point sente for you and 2.5 for white.

So we can look at combinations but you can see that ordeer moves should be played.

L16, A4, N17, and J14 last.

G3 is also sente, but E3 is the key move there.  But if you play G3, you have to follow up with G1 which is reverse sente for you the calculations for that are bit more complicated.  So G3 is another big move.  That you can play after J14 to finish off the sequence to give up sente. Please look at example

Defending against P3 is also a good calculation, because of the follow up.  So it is reverse sente, but the few options there can lead to good counting practice :).  I'll leave it to you.]
;W[pp];B[oq];W[jk];B[gq]C[*: A4 is bigger ... but all the sente points are still open, you close to start with end game move that will end in gote for you.]

*: Gote move worth 2 points, you got A4, J14, T3 (another interseting calculation).

*: Lets count again, since it is a bit more defined...

Black: Right (29) Left (22) Bottom (42) : Total (93)
White: Top (58) Right (18) Bottom (16) : Total (92)
