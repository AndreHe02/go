;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp];W[fp]LB[fq:A]C[This make me to think a couple of time, because I am wondering whether I should put K16 or invasion. And finally I decised to invasion because I think making K16 is to passive. Am I right? Or still have some better move?


Attacking a corner is a common move in this situation. Playing F4 / F3 is fine.

By playing K16 now you maybe lose an opportunity.];B[fo];W[dq]
C[Originally, I wanted to get the corner, but failed. After black more, then I realised that I have to sacrifice W8, how can I have the right respond for black 7?

I don´t think W8 isn`t a bad move here if you want the corner.

How about; B9: E3, W10: C4];B[eq];W[fq]C[This a is a horrible move.

Options are here as i said before, or go for E4 and lose W8.]
;B[er];W[ep];B[cq];W[fr];B[dr];W[iq]LB[eo:A]C[Playing A first, i think is better.]
;B[jq];W[jr]C[Is J4 better than K2?
Or having another great move?

K2 is much to early. As mentioned, go for the cut first (safe play), then maybe a move like D10.]
;B[ip];W[hq];B[kr];W[hp];B[ho];W[eo];B[go];W[dn]LB[do:A]C[Have to play A here.]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[co];W[em];B[gm];W[bm];B[fk];W[dj]LB[dk:A]C[After this couple of movement, I began to worry about black's outward power, but I don't know how to weaken this, can you show me the right respond?

Playing A here is the best move. All other moves gives Black the opportunity to attack white´s weakness (cutting at D7).]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[dl];W[dm];B[cl];W[bk];B[ej];W[di];B[ei];W[dg]
;B[pj]C[Another point that made me to think, whether I should play R13, or K16, and finally I did the K16 to ensure my territery. Am I right?
Or still have another great move?

Playing K16 is a good move here; maybe a little large. But I had done the same here.]
;W[jd];B[qf]LB[qn:A]C[Firstly, I wanted to play R12, but I thought it is too risk, so I did O16. Am I too conservative?

Playing R12 is fine here. If you want to attack, play R6.];W[nd]
;B[of];W[qe]LB[qn:A]C[Not really necessary. There are a lot of bigger points to do.]
;B[ke];W[kd];B[le];W[ld];B[me];W[ne];B[oe];W[lh]LB[qn:A]C[Now I am again worring about black's outward power, so I played M12. Am I right? Or still have better move?

Again, playing at R6. Still this move isnt bad either.];B[nf]
;W[mg];B[ie];W[hc];B[je];W[jg];B[hf];W[ph];B[oh];W[oi];B[pi]
;W[nh];B[og];W[nj];B[mf];W[hh];B[fg]C[Because I am worrying black invasion at F16, therefore I leave the weakness of the centre stones and play F16. Should I ensure the living of the centre stones first?

Yes. That correct. Center first.];W[fd];B[oj];W[ni];B[mi]C[Worse move by Black.]
;W[lj];B[ng]C[Now I am worrying the living of centre stones, so I move M13 to prevent Repetitive capture position , am I right ?

Yes.];W[lg];B[jh];W[ji]C[Originally, I want to capture black 83, but failed, becuase of black 33 stone.
How can I respond to this invasion?

I think this move is good. You just made a follow up mistake. How about playing J11 before J13 ?]
;B[ih];W[ig];B[ii];W[ij];B[hi];W[ki];B[kh];W[kg];B[gh];W[hg]
;B[hj];W[ik];B[jk];W[jj];B[mk]C[Now I find that the centre white stones will die, so I start escape from black's attack.

Playing N 10 here is only move you can do. Otherwise you get cut.]
;W[mj];B[lk];W[kk];B[jl];W[kl];B[nk];W[lm];B[jm];W[nm]C[Good move.]
;B[ok];W[pm]C[This move I want to separate the black stones, but failed. Am I too aggressive?

No, i don`t think to. Q7 or directly attacking the corner is the best way here.]
;B[om];W[on]C[Is P8 better?

No.];B[ol];W[po]LB[mn:B][nn:A]C[You can´t save Q7 here. First A or B then while he is going for Q7 (if so), go for the corner.]
;B[nn];W[mn];B[no];W[kn];B[km];W[ll];B[nl];W[mo];B[mm];W[ko]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[kq];W[mp];B[lq];W[np];B[op];W[mq];B[lo];W[ln]
;B[io];W[mr];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[pr];W[ps]C[I think this is the bad move.

To make W live, you had to play, P5. Then R4.];B[os];W[ns];B[qr]
;W[lr];B[ls];W[oo]C[Good move.];B[nm];W[qp];B[pq];W[rq]LB[qo:A]
C[You had to play this.];B[qo];W[pn];B[rp];W[jn];B[im];W[in]
;B[hn];W[hl]C[Good move.];B[hm];W[gk];B[gj];W[fl];B[gl];W[hk]
;B[ir];W[hr];B[js];W[rr]C[Good move.];B[qq];W[qs];B[qp]LB[qn:A]
C[That should have done it. Another large chance.];W[sr];B[rs]
;W[ss];B[qn];W[fn];B[hs];W[gs];B[fm];W[el];B[ek];W[is]LB[bl:A]
C[Bad move. Had to play A.];B[bl];W[al];B[cj];W[jr];B[bj];W[bh]
;B[ak];W[ks];B[am];W[dh]C[Am I too aggressive too save the centre stones?

Yes. Normaly black´s group here is already dead. You didn`t need to attack there.]
;B[js];W[fj];B[fi];W[ks];B[md];W[ms];B[mc];W[nc];B[od];W[oc]
;B[pe]LB[qd:A]C[I saw this variation pretty oftern now. Playing A is much more solid.]
;W[qc];B[re]LB[qd:A]C[Bad shape, but you have to play A then.]
;W[rd];B[qd];W[pc];B[rc];W[rb];B[sd];W[pa];B[nb];W[ob];B[sb]
;W[ra];B[na]C[I think black this move is too mercy for me, if black moves R18, I will die. How can I prevent it before hand?

He had to play this move. Otherwise, you can attack at N18.

Anyway, you made the mistake before, as i mentioned.];W[qb]
;B[ic];W[id];B[hd];W[ib];B[jc];W[kc];B[jb];W[kb];B[gc];W[hb]
;B[gd]LB[fc:A]C[A is more solid here. You get cut anyway.];W[gb]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[fe]C[Same mistake again. See move W206.];W[fb]
;B[de];W[ce];B[ed];W[db]LB[dc:A]C[Again... Should play A here.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[cf];W[be];B[bd];W[df];B[bf];W[ee];B[ae];W[de]
;B[ah];W[bc]LB[ai:A]C[First A, then Black´s group should be dead.]
;B[af];W[cc];B[ad];W[ac];B[ai];W[bg];B[ag];W[bi];B[bn];W[eh]
;B[fh];W[cg];B[do];W[aj]C[This is my losing move, at that moment I just want to kill and don't think!!
I am so stupid.

No comment *g*. Still, you are right. You had to proctect it.]
;B[en]C[At this point I know I will lose the game

At this point you can resign.  Since black´s group is alive, the grasp is to large now to catch up anymore.]
;W[gp];B[sp];W[rs];B[sq];W[os];B[ml];W[fd];B[ge];W[ed];B[lb]
;W[ka];B[la];W[ci];B[es];W[ai];B[lc];W[ja];B[il];W[gg];B[ff]
;W[sa];B[sc];W[qm];B[rm];W[rl];B[ql];W[tt]C[Thank you for review.

My pleasure. As advice take you time while attacking and then finish it. You got a lot of good / difficult to read moves and then you didn´t use any of them in this game.

On the other hand take a look at these one for one point plays (right upper corner). You can avoid this.]
