C[Hello, I am Brian Kirby.  Thanks in advance for taking the time to do a review for me!

I played white in this game.

J: I am Juuso Nyyss√∂nen, your reviewer. I'll prefix all my comments with J:]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[cd]C[I usually don't play the 3-4 point much as white.  I decided to try it out this time, though.]
;B[ed]
(;W[df]C[I played D14 because I don't want black to get influence along the side.  If black played D14 instead of me, I feel like it would work well with his D4 stone.

J: This is not a bad move, but it might be a bit slow, especially considering you have no komi.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[be]C[I was OK with this joseki for the same reason that was mentioned before: I wanted to disrupt the relationship with the D4 stone and the stones on top.]
;B[hd]C[J: Weird move by black. He should certainly play on the 3rd line to settle.]

(;W[cn]C[I played C6 because I thought it worked OK with the white stones in the top left.  Now, though, I'm not really sure.  Perhaps F3 would have been better.

The reason I feel this is because with the top left joseki, the white stones seem to be "finished".  In other words, maybe the left side is not so big...  What do you think?

J: This does not look like a bad move. D14 is kind of looking forward to an extension on the 3rd line.]
;B[fq]
(;W[dj]TR[dh][cl]C[Is it OK?

J: Hmm, I don't really like it. It still leaves two weaknesses, so you can't even really fix it well with one move. Look at the variation.]
;B[nc]
(;W[ob]SQ[qj]C[I might play P18 too often (in relation to the Q16 stone, after an approach like this).  Is it appropriate to play it now?

J: P18 does not make much sense here.  It would be ok if you already had an extension around R10 or were strong in the surrounding area.]
;B[qf]C[J: This move is nice for black here. You can't counter-attack very well because black is stronger here.]

(;W[lc]C[What do you think about M17?

J: White's shape has some problems. :)];B[ne]C[J: I'm not really sure why black is trying to save this stone. He could just sacrifice it.]
;W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[qe];W[od];B[nd]
(;W[qd]C[Perhaps it is bigger to play something like O18 or K17...

J: Hmm, this move is quite big..];B[kd]C[J: You could probably tenuki already. Messing around on the upper side just made black's wall stronger.]

(;W[ld];B[le];W[ke];B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[mb];B[lf]
(;W[kf];B[lg];W[jc];B[jd];W[ic];B[id];W[ib];B[og]
(;W[nf];B[ng];W[me]C[Here, I felt successful in capturing the three stones...  But perhaps black's influence is too great...?

J: Yeah, black gains too much here. Capturing these stones isn't worth it.]
;B[jg];W[ql]C[I jumped in to try to make the wall ineffective.

J: Fair enough.];B[qn]
(;W[qi];B[pj]C[I think that this was a good choice for black.

J: Probably.]
(;W[qj];B[pk];W[rm];B[qk];W[rk];B[pl]
(;W[rn]C[Perhaps it is better to play R7 instead of S6, and if black plays Q7, tenuki.  What do you think?

J: This move looks good.];B[qm];W[rl];B[qo]
(;W[kq];B[lp]C[I thought this was another good choice by black.]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[kp]C[Instead of L4, I think K5 may have been better.  Black's potential in the center is getting too big!

J: Maybe.];B[ko];W[hq]C[H3 is probably bad.  If I did L4, I should probably follow up with K5!

J: Yes, you should certainly K5 here.];B[bp];W[kn]C[J: Odd move. It looks like an overplay.]
;B[jo];W[ln];B[mq]C[J: You're essentially just making 2 weak groups here.]
;W[lo]C[M5 seems like an overplay.  Perhaps j7 is better...  Added to this, white's stones on the bottom are getting weak.  This part is probably not so good for w.

J: Yeah, it's beginning to look hard for white.];B[jn];W[jm]
;B[km]C[J: I can't see a good way for white here.]
(;W[lm];B[kl];W[im];B[ho];W[hn]C[I misread H6 at first, so this is probably pretty bad...]
;B[hp];W[io];B[jp];W[ip];B[jq];W[jr];B[kr];W[lr];B[ir];W[ks]
;B[iq];W[in];B[hr]C[J: Yeah, this is not very good for white.]
;W[mr];B[nr];W[nq];B[np];W[oq];B[op];W[pr]C[This all seems quite small.  I need to do something in the center, I feel, but I don't know what. :-(

J: Yeah, the center is hard to handle. The game already looks lost for white.]
;B[jl];W[kh];B[jh];W[ji]C[This sequence was probably not good for w, but I didn't know what else to do but to try to get inside the center...

J: Sure, you have to try something here to win. It does look a bit futile, though.]
;B[ii];W[jj];B[ij];W[kg];B[lh];W[jk];B[ik];W[il]
(;B[kk];W[lj];B[gn];W[go];B[gp];W[gm];B[fn]
(;W[fm];B[em];W[en];B[fo];W[el];B[ki];W[kj];B[li];W[mj];B[dm]
C[Looking back, I lost a lot of points at c6, but I felt I had to safe the J7 stones.  Maybe there was a better way?

J: You can't really hope for much territory here because the J7 stones have very few liberties.]
;W[fl];B[cm];W[cl];B[bm];W[ih];B[hh];W[ig]C[Maybe this is too greedy.  I wanted to get the black stones... all of them.  But maybe that was expecting too much.  Perhaps trying to expand the left side would have been better.  What do you think?

J: This looks reasonable.];B[jf];W[hg];B[gh];W[gg];B[fg]
(;W[hi];B[fh];W[gj]C[J: Better at H9. In the game black gets forcing moves like G14.]
;B[dh]C[This seems really big for black... :-(

J: Yeah, unfortunately.];W[ch];B[ci];W[di];B[bi];W[bh];B[bk]
;W[bl];B[ck];W[dl];B[al];W[if];B[je];W[ge];B[gf];W[ff];B[ef]
;W[fe];B[ee];W[hk];B[dg];W[bb]C[B18 seems too cowardly.  I think I should have fought for the two stones at C12.  Maybe just C14 would have been much better...

J: C14 does seem bigger.];B[bg];W[bf];B[cg];W[pi]C[J: This is not so big. R3 on the other hand is pretty big.]
;B[ml];W[ll];B[mk];W[lk];B[mm];W[qg]C[This was a terrible move.  I did not put enough thought into it at all, and just played based on (miscalculated) shape recognition. :-(

J: :<];B[qh];W[rg];B[rh];W[re];B[rf];W[qq]C[At this point, black seems way too far ahead.  I think that R13 was especially a bad move.

J: Yes.];B[ro];W[ri];B[rq];W[rr];B[cb];W[ad];B[hb];W[ja];B[hc]

C[Kirby [1d\]: thanks
Colorless [1k\]: thanks

J: The main problems in this game stemmed from giving your opponent huge influence and then making weak groups. Also, remember that P18 usually requires some degree of support nearby. .)]
)
(;W[if];B[je];W[ff]C[J: You could play like this, I think. It looks hard for black to live here.]
))
(;W[kj]C[J: You could play this now. Black can't kill your J6 stones and you save your L14 stones this way.]
))
(;B[lk]C[J: Black could certainly play better here. White looks pretty dead. :)]
))
(;W[kl];B[lm];W[ll];B[mm];W[im]C[J: You could try just sacrificing part of your stones. It's better than the game, at least. Your bottom group still has some problems, though.]
))
(;W[kp]C[J: You could play your wedge high here. It's a bit harder for black to press your stone down now and take the center.]
))
(;W[qm]C[J: If you carry this out...];B[pm];W[en];B[rn]C[J: Black gets this, which is sente against your group.]
;W[sl]C[J: Black's corner is much bigger compared to the game.]
))
(;W[rh]C[J: You could try this response. It threatens to cut at R13 and also connects your stones.]
;B[qg];W[qk]C[J: Maybe something like this. Black is not as thick in the center as in the game.]
))
(;W[ol]C[J: You could consider jumping into the center here instead of extending. Black became really strong in the center after you extended on the side.]
;B[qj];W[oj]C[J: You should be able to manage.]))
(;W[ql]C[J: White should already tenuki at this point. Capturing the three stones just makes black's wall stronger.]
))
(;W[je]C[J: You should at least fight it out when you've come this far. Just taking the K18 stone at this point is too tame, black becomes too strong here.]
;B[ic];W[jg]C[J: Fight.]))
(;W[nb]C[J: Another option is just to play this.];B[ld]C[J: Now you get the opportunity to tenuki. Black's wall is not nearly as threatening as in the game.]
))
(;W[nb];B[rc]C[J: You do give up the corner, but the 3 black stones look a bit silly now. I guess this is better than the game.]
))
(;W[qe];B[pf];W[ne]C[J: This is the usual joseki here, but...]
;B[qj]C[J: It's quite comfortable for black. White hasn't gained much.]
))
(;W[qf]C[J: Just extending seems ok.]))
(;W[bp];B[cq];W[ck]TR[df]C[J: This looks better. Black only has one place to invade now, around C11. There's also a nice balance between D14 and C9 - 4th line and 3rd line.]
))
(;W[jc]C[J: I'd kinda want to play this now, though. Black decided to play on the 4th line for some reason and this makes him pay for it. :)]
))
(;W[ec]C[J: Playing this normal joseki shouldn't be bad.])
(;W[hd]C[J: Pincering would certainly be more active. This also works well with your Q16 stone.]
