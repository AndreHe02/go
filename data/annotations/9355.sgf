AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[TheEyes [1d\]: hi, gg
Kch [5d\]: hi.

I played black in this game and enjoyed the game very much. There was some fighting and big exchanges, but I felt like I just got lucky at one place. Thank you for the review!

reid: I see that black won this game.  In order to get the most out of the Go Teaching Ladder (and indeed, from any teaching game), you should submit a game that you lost, preferably one that you can't figure out why you lost.  The lesson will be much more effective.

Also, handicap games are not the best candidates for lessons.  Since white starts with such an extreme disadvantage, he is going to be taking risks and chances that would not be reasonable in an even game, and therefore handicap games tend to be strangely skewed right from the start.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[fq];B[cn];W[fc]LB[jp:A]C[reid: white should probably play at A (K4) instead.  F17 is asking for trouble, trying to move too fast.  In a handicap game, white needs to give black a chance to make mistakes which requires a certain amount of patience.]

;B[op];W[or];B[rq]LB[np:A]C[reid: black might prefer to push white into his strong L3 stone with A (O4).]
;W[mq];B[df]LB[br:A]C[I felt good here. I was a bit afraid about h3 coming under attack later, so maybe it was better to immediately try to streghten this group for a better attack on f2 and p2 group?

reid: If you're worried about H3/L3, then joining up with O4 (instead of S3 on the previous move) is a good plan.

An alternative is to defend by attacking: black A (B2) instead of D14, reduces the white F2 group to one gote eye.  Black is certainly not going to kill this group, but on the other hand, it's much harder for white to attack black when he has to worry about his own weakness.]
;W[qm]C[reid:  This is an overplay.  Black is much stronger than white here, and the proverb says "play away from strength".]
;B[rm];W[pn];B[ql]LB[rn:A]C[reid:  This atari helps white (aji-keshi).  Better would be to simply connect at A (S6) and let white's weak group struggle.]
;W[qo];B[pm];W[rn];B[qm];W[po];B[ro];W[qp];B[rp];W[no]C[reid: white captures three stones, but it's not very satisfying.  The black L3 group means white has no future territory in this area (unless he kills the L3 group - not very likely).]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[jd];W[nc];B[pf]LB[oc:A]C[reid: this is a good time for white to 'kick' first with A (P17).]
;W[pb];B[mc]LB[qc:A]C[I wanted to strenghten k16 for a better attack on f16

reid: The best way to strengthen K16 is to keep white weak.  That means black really must take A (R17) now to keep white from getting easy life.

K16 should either be a splitting attack, or if white plays a connect-under move (K18), black is satisfied to have forced white into such a low position.  In short, K16 is very flexible, and there is no need to strengthen it right away.  R17 is both big territorially, and important strategically.  Take it now!]
;W[md];B[lc];W[ld];B[nb]LB[ob:C][kc:A][oc:B][nd:D]C[reid: This is another aji-keshi move that helps white.  If left unplayed, black might prefer to play at B (P17) later, threatening to either cut off Q18 (C - P18) or to cut at D (O16).

Black should simply pull back to A (L17).];W[oc];B[kd]LB[jb:A]
C[reid: Watch out for this shape.  It invites white to peep with A.]
;W[jb];B[ib];W[ic]C[I took a lot of time here to think. I considered h18 and k17 variation

reid: Yes, the peep at K18 is very difficult to answer.  The subsequent fighting is messy and difficult - just what white usually wants in a handicap game.]

(;B[hb];W[jc];B[hc];W[id];B[kc];W[eb];B[hd];W[ie];B[he];W[hf]
;B[if];W[je];B[ke];W[jf];B[ig];W[lf];B[db];W[ce]C[reid: This is aji-keshi for white (helps black).

It looks like a free-for-all along the top edge.  White doesn't have time for this apparent forcing move.  It gives white some advantage in the corner, but that's not important right now.  The top edge fight is everything at the moment.

There are at least 5 significant groups that are unstable at the moment.  That's way too chaotic.  Since this is a handicap game, it's better for white than for black (white is a stronger fighter, and he needs to take risks).

Go is not supposed to be a game of chance :-)];B[de]C[Any comments on this fight would be highly appreciated, I guess this was the most important part of the game

reid: This exchange (C15-D15) is extremely helpful for black in the top-edge fight.  Big mistake for white.]
;W[ih];B[hg];W[jg];B[hh]LB[gf:A]C[reid: black has a chance to simplify everything by taking H14 with A.]
;W[gf]C[Since I can always connect with f18, I felt save here

reid: Yes, but wouldn't it be much simpler to have just taken H14 when you had the chance?]
;B[fg];W[ed];B[dc];W[ff];B[fb];W[eg];B[fh];W[gb];B[ea];W[cg]
;B[dg]LB[eh:A][ci:B]C[reid: This doesn't seem to do much for black.  The corner is already alive.  Black needs to keep the center stones (H12) safe, so perhaps turning at A (F12) is appropriate.  Or he could consider attacking the left side stones with B (C11), although this could be risky for those center stones.

Note that if black gets strong in the center, he can look forward to good results from removing white's eye with B2.]
;W[ch];B[kf]C[This was a probe. I wanted to see if white will respond at m13 or l13

reid: Either way, the exchange helps white more than it helps black.  At best, you've lost a ko threat.]

(;W[kg];B[dh];W[cj];B[di];W[bk]C[This pushing felt awkward. I don't know what else should I do.

reid: Yes, the first push at D13 gets you started on the wrong foot.

However, we can count the board at this point to get an idea of where things stand.  On the top edge, black and white have both made captures that are almost exactly the same size.  Black can get a few more points in the top left corner (about 5).  The top right corner is up for grabs (no points for either side yet), but we should give black about five points for Q16 and Q14.  Net 10 for black so far.

White has about 8 on the left edge, and black has about the same.  The lower right corner is also close to an even split, with white maybe three points bigger.  If we give two points each to black's H3 group and white's F2 group, we end up with black being about 7 points ahead.

Looking at influence, the center seems to be pretty even.  White has nowhere to get large amounts of territory, while black could get some on the right edge.

So unless black makes a serious mistake, this should be his game.

I am going to end my commentary here.  Both black and white should work on avoiding aji-keshi.  It's difficult to not make those sente moves, but you really need to consider whether the exchange is helpful to you or to your opponent.

Good luck, play strong - reid.];B[qb]C[Hoping to use the m15 aji]
