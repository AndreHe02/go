KM[5.5];B[dp];W[od];B[qp];W[op]C[Jared: I was foolishly imagining a black move around D16 followed by white R5, then retaining sente and then playing an approach to D16.  I guess I am trying too hard to keep black from making a shimari.


Usually you only make an early approach like this if you have a friendly stone in the corner behind you.  This gives B a good combination extension and pincer.


Your move at P16 is biased toward the upper side, since when B comes in to the upper right corner you will get an outside wall facing left.  Given your move at P16, the upper left corner is importnat for you.  So just play there now.]
;B[lp]C[Jared: I think white 6 should be at P6, and I ghuess black will end in sente allowing black to play first around D16.  I guess this is ok.

You should probably answer this.  P6 or Q7 are OK.  After P6,
R6, p8, R8, R3, S2, Q3, R2, you

have given B territory in exchange for a wall and should attack the stone at M4 with a move around K4.  This attack would be more

effective if the D4 stone was white, so the move at P6 might give up too much teritory.

Q7 is a way to live quickly without giving up too much.  You can
look up the joseki...];W[cd];B[oo]C[Jared:  I think this is awful for white.  Black will gain a ton of power by attacking my eyeless stones.

Correct.  This move should be at Q7 (or P6, or even R5).];W[no];B[pp]C[Better to play Q5.  It still threatens to cut at O4, but doesn't leave the atari at P6 behind.]
;W[on]C[Good.  Force an empty triangle right away.];B[po];W[mp];B[nn];W
[mn]C[This move is not good.  Forcing Bto extend at O7 is just what he wants, and gives him the start of a big territory.  When you find yourself pushing someone from behind and giving him territory, try to think of something better.]
;B[nm];W[lo];B[kp]C[The last two W moves make a false eye, and give B a start on territory on the right.  You want to avoid moves like N6 if you can since you force B to mave at O7, which is good for him.

Perhaps your move at N4 could
have been at O4, then if B O6,

play M5, L5, M6, and you are threatening to capture the stone at o6, or cut at L4.


Or, since B didn't respond directly to N4, after he cuts at O6, you could play M5 right away (since the N6, O6 exchange is bad for W.  If B responds to M5 at L4, you could try P7, then attack the B stone in the center.]
;W[oq];B[mq]C[Jared: I probably can't afford to play R16. I  probably have to N7 as painful as it may be.


N7 is another example of pushing from behind.  Don't do it unless it is the only way to survive.  Even M8 is better.]
;W[qd];B[qi]C[Jared:  But black lets me N7  anyway...


B wants you to play N7, since it forces him to extend at O8, making a big territory.  You should be trying to figure out how to reduce that territory, not solidify it.  Perhaps a move like Q9 or Q10is possible.


R11 is a great move for B since it extends in front of your shimari and makes a good moyo.]
;W[mm];B[nl]C[Jared: Again I probably have to  L5, black K5, white K6.]
;W[cn]C[If you must push at N7, strengthening your self, at least use the strength you just built by invading around J3 or J4 to attack  the 3 stone B group.]
;B[nq];W[np];B[fp];W[cj]C[I would prefer to play this high, around D10, since now all 3 stones on the left are on the third line.  Notice that B's stones on the bottom are on the 4th line.  B has a better framework.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[df]C[This move leaves some weakness behind.  If C10 were at D10, you could consider playing at C14.]
;B[jc];W[lc];B[jn]C[Great move, expanding the B lower side while attacking W, and maybe W will push from behind again...]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[pr]C[Jared: I get a half eye in sente.  I was thinking I  would get a whole  eye.]
;B[rq];W[ml]C[Another push...  The reason B got so much territory on the right was the W moves at N6, N7, N8.

This move could be played at M9.];B[nk];W[jl];B[hm]C[Jared:  A black play here seems so huge that I just had to play C3.]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[Jared:  I guess white should 48 B4 first.];W[fr]C[The usual move is W B4, B D3, W B2, B C2, W B3.  W ends in sente, and takes a bite out of the corner.  If W b4, B B5, B b2, B a4, W B3, B C5, W can slide all the way to F2, and stay connected and live.  This is better for W in this position, so B will block at D3 rather than B5.

This move works out better than
either of these sequences, so it's not so bad.


It seems that B is better at fuseki and whole board strategy, but W is a better fighter, so starting a fight here since you are behind is not a bad strategy.]
;B[dq];W[ir];B[er];W[kr]C[Good, don't respond directly to B when you are trying to live in a small area.]
;B[lr];W[gq];B[fq];W[gp];B[gr];W[hr];B[fs]C[Jared:  I guess making shape at white 60 J4
would have been the move.  Should black have handled this whole invasion  differently?


B's moves don't look unreasonable to me.  He gets a secure corner, and a weak W group to chase.]

(;W[go]C[Making shape at J4 may be better,but then B can play H5..];B[ip]

 Jared 6k : is entering byo-yomi


This move looks pretty good, like B may even kill W, but it is a litle optimistic since B has a weak group to the right.


A better plan might be to jump to E6 instead of F6.  After chasingwhite into the center, if B gets
a stone around E8 he can play
to C8.];W[in]C[W plays well here, to escape.];B[im];W[io];B[jo];W[jm];B
[ho];W[gn];B[hn];W[gm];B[ik];W[lj];B[el]C[We can see now that F6 would be better placed at E6.]
;W[gk];B[gl]C[This is too optimistic again, since B is weak on the left.  Better to just invade at C8 now rather than make W strong before invading.]
;W[fl];B[hl];W[fm];B[cl]C[The wedge at G8 should only be played if B can follow up now with a cut at F9.  Without the two W stones at F7/F8, this invasion would be more severe.]
;W[en];B[bn]C[Jared:  I guess E9 dominates as a big move now.  I am having a territory panic attack.  It seems to me balck has an easy win if he just sits back, almost no matter what I do.


B is winning since W gave him that big area on the right.  W's invasion in the bottom didn't hurt him much since he secured the corner.

B can't cut at F9 now, so there is no big hurry to defend it at E9.];W[le]
C[To take territory, I prefer R13 to this move.  If B answers R13 at P11, you can still play M15, and if he ignores R13, you should be able to invade the big territory.]
;B[qf];W[oi];B[pk]C[Q10 is a little stronger.  A knight's move folowed by a 2 point jump is a little weak on connectivity.]
;W[hc]C[Jared: Which is bigger,
white 92 at H17 or  E9?


I like this move (H17) much better.  You are behind, and this is the best place to start a fight since you are strong on both sides.When B ignores M15, you should invade pretty quickly.]
;B[hd];W[gd];B[gc];W[id];B[ge];W[ic]C[

 jint 6k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[ie];W[jd]C[Good sequence for W.  B is still not alive, and W gained lots of territory.]
;B[fo]C[Jared:  I should have played white 102 at  E9.];W[em]C[If this move is at E9, you give B E7, and 10 points of additional territory, in exchange for potential in the upper left.  I prefer your move, but E9 is OK also.]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[ej];W[js]C[Jared:  The position seems almost desparate for white to live.  I think black can win just by playing black 105 at C12 and letting me play H1


W is OK, since he can run towards the weak B group at the top, or cut on the left, or make the ko you make at M1 later


If you would ignore B C12 to live and let B get more territory, you would probably lose...]
;B[hs];W[cm];B[bm];W[bl];B[ck]C[Why not just B B9 to capture a W stone?  After B B9, W D8, B C9,
W D9, B D10, W D7, B is cut off,


but he is cut off anyway with the first move at C9, and capturing astone at B9 is bigger.]
;W[bk];B[co];W[gh]C[I would try to capture the 5 black cutting stones now, but maybe the 3 W stones to the left are too weak.]
;B[eh]C[

 Jared 6k : has entering byo-yomi  again];W[ii]C[You could try something like W d11, B E11, W F13 and see if the B stones die.]
;B[jk];W[nr];B[kl];W[km];B[kj];W[mk];B[jh]C[Good enclosing move.];W[ch]
C[Maybe D11, E11, H14, H15, F13 would work, but B might not cooperate.


Your one weak group is separating 3 weak B groups, so you should think about attacking.  But C12 is not bad, taking territory while forcing B to connect through dame.]
;B[fg];W[ls];B[ms];W[mr];B[ks];W[bo]C[W has lots of threats to live, so is in  no danger.]
;B[bp];W[ls];B[rd]C[Jared:   Black Q17 would have been a much bigger threat?  How about  C15?


Q17 has the drawback that after B lives in the corner, W will be stronger on the outside and may be able to play S12 or some such to take away B territory too.

C15 is a very big threat.];W[ns];B[qc];W[pc];B[qe]C[maybe it would be better to play R18 or S18 first.]
;W[qb]C[good.];B[pd];W[rc];B[qd];W[oc]C[W didn't lose much for the ko.]
;B[pq]C[Black 143  P3 seemed unbelievably kind.  Even so, I still think I'm  behind.


P3 just fills a dame.  It looks like B got upset with your invasion of the lower side and has been trying to kill it too hard.


This move should be used to defend the big weak B group, perhaps at K11.  B is still ahead on territory, but W is thicker since B has that big weak group.]
;W[nj];B[je]C[B's center group is weak, and needs more direct defense.  Perhaps
K11 first, threatening to make a second eye.];W[ji]C[

Very good.  Attacking the
weak B group wins the game for W.];B[ki];W[kh]C[good.];B[li];W[jg];B[mh]

 Jared 6k : has entering byo-yomi  again];W[lf];B[jh];W[ok]C[Jared: Black has  good ko threats near M7 as well as H10.  Black should respond to white  166.  Probably at P8?


B does has several ko threats to live he can use first, but if he responds at P8, W will have several more ko threats as well.

If B does respond here, maybe Q8 is better.];B[ig];W[pl]C[Jared:  Black should R8?

After B R8, W can still get
into the right side, so I'm not sure it is any better than Q7.]

;W[nf]C[Jared:  Black S6 not urgent.  Black should probably Q13.   Suddenly white has a winning game.

B is behind now, and needs
something big to catch up, but I don't see anything big.  The
B group around E9 is only weakly


connected out, so an invasion around C13 or C15 is unlikely to work, and B probably can't even capture the W stones at J11.]
