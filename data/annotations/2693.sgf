C[Hello,

first I want to thank you for your time.

It is not necessary to review the moves after B207 where I made a very big mistake. But if you want to point out my yose-mistakes, feel free to do so ;)

I am mainly interested in the first half of the game. Some questions are added.

Thank you again,
Joerg

(I played Black)

Dieter: My comments will be preceded by "dv"];B[qe];W[dd];B[pp]
;W[dq];B[oc]C[This is a rather odd shape, I know. I read about in in GoWorld 89 and wanted to experiment a little bit.

dv: Why not. I'll never discourage people to experiment in the opening.]
;W[jc];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dm];W[fq]C[dv: Just as a sidenote. After White 12, the bottom has become less interesting. One will see that in games by stronger players,  both will struggle to let the other one play around N3-O3. White 12 influences the behaviour on the whole lower right quarter of the board.]
;B[ci]C[dv: Incidentally, the same does not hold for White 13. The Black formation still has an invasion point, so a follow up move in the upper left, though not immediately urgent, will be interesting rather soon.

Caution: these are things I am acquiring myself, hence I'm probably not qualified to teach about them. Consider it "just a thought".]
;W[mc];B[oe]C[This is the so called `pillbox` shape. I do not know, if I play it ever again. I need 3 plays in the corner. Sure, I thought the croner was safe, but that was not correct.

dv: If you read the pillbox section on sensei's library, you'll see that White 15 is the usual way for pros to approach it. Clearly the shape isn't safe yet (we'll see later).]
;W[qj]
(;B[qm]C[dv: Given the insecurity of the pillbox and the low position of White 12 (F3) I suggest the variation.

I will digress a little in that variation, just to show the kind of things a 2d thinks about in the opening, mainly taking White 12 into account. This includes the nonsensical thoughts of a 2d, so beware.]
;W[qg];B[jq]LB[cf:a][cg:b][kq:c][hq:d][iq:e][oq:f]C[Was it the right time to play such a move?

dv: As you will understand from my earlier digressions, Black 19 is too close to the strong White position. There are two things here:

1) I think the upper left is now more urgent. Black 'a' strengthens the Black side and attacks the corner, White 'b' prepares an invasion while building some sort of sphere of influence. Both can be called sente and have additional value.

2) If you play at the bottom, you should hold to 'c'. If White later invades, you can extend to 'd' and then there  are some endgame possibilities against White's corner. If White plays 'e' in response to 'c', he plays too close to his strength and you can happily build at the other side. You could also consider strengthening the corner with 'f' instead of 19 or 'c'. Anyway it is probably better to make a favourable exchange in the upper left first.]
;W[pq];B[oq]C[dv: here you decide which side is important: the corner or the outside. Given the wide position of 19, I'd say you have chosen right but at the same time it indicates the bad position of 19 because your moyo building will be one sided: there is nothing you can do against White 12.]
;W[or]
(;B[qq]LB[op:a][pr:b]C[I don`t know. Maybe this is rude.

Do you know a better play? Maybe P4?

dv: The atari is okay but unusual. I did a little database research on gobase. In the vast majority of cases Black connects on the outside at 'a' and else cuts at 'b'. I found one pro game in which the atari was played. See further.]
;W[pr];B[op];W[qr]
(;B[rp]LB[rq:a]C[dv: Too slow: should be at 'a' (see var)];W[mq]
;B[mo]LB[rr:a]C[dv: this shape is a little strange. I'd prefer to play at 'a'.]
;W[kp];B[lq]
(;W[lr]C[dv: strange move. Cutting would be natural, and White can still live in the corner.]
;B[kq];W[rq];B[qp];W[sq];B[mp]C[dv: very good shape.];W[nq]
;B[rh]C[After building a wall I thought it was the time to attack the two white stones.

Do you have another idea?
Is this the correct move for attacking?

dv: I still consider the upper left to be bigger. I understand you want to put your thickness to use but on the other hand White has no really effective move here, so why should you? You could play in the upper left and treat White's group as a constant burden for him. That's the patient way to use thickness.

If you attack now, White can treat his stones lightly, give you low territory and even attack the upper right pillbox.]
;W[rg];B[qi];W[pi];B[rj];W[qh];B[ri];W[oh];B[pj];W[oj];B[pk]
C[dv: Now you are ovverconcentrated and the pillbox is weak.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[I tried this move. The following sequence shows, it was wrong...

Any ideas?

dv: With all the white strength around it is difficult to kill this stone. Let's look at the most obvious alternatives.]
;W[pb];B[pc];W[rc];B[ob];W[qa];B[rd];W[rb]C[Well, White lives small, but what can I do with my strength? I rather feel overconcentrated and not yet alive

dv: Indeed. White pulls off another succesful invasion. Your group is safe for the moment: P19 is sente and with N18 it makes another eye. But of course there is a lot of aji here.]
;B[ni];W[oi]
(;B[og]C[Not the best move to attack...

Maybe N14 or N15?

dv: Either run out at N15 or tenuki.];W[nh];B[cf]LB[me:a]C[dv: This is undoubtably big. I think this is  rather correct too: White must prove he can kill the upper right. Moving out at 'a' is safer but also quite slow.]
;W[pg]C[dv: Very slow by white. You can ignore and invade the upper left. Your group is rather safe.]

(;B[of]LB[me:a]C[This move was placed to fast.

dv: If you protect it, jump out at 'a'.];W[mf];B[ng]C[dv: This can't be right. If you see yourself making an empty triangle, think three times before playing it.]
;W[mg]
(;B[rf]C[I have to live now

dv: let's see];W[df];B[dg]LB[ce:a]C[dv: this feels overconcentrated

Maybe better at 'a'];W[ce]
(;B[eg]C[dv: unusual. See var.];W[bf]C[dv: This is painful.]
;B[hd]C[I`d rather sacrifice C14.

But maybe this was too deep];W[ie];B[ec];W[dc];B[he];W[cg]C[dv: With this ponnuki, Black's stones in the upper right are scattered. The game is not lost, but I'd prefer to have White here.]
;B[ch]LB[ei:a][if:b]C[dv: Better at 'a' or even at 'b'.];W[ff]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[hb];W[id];B[hc];W[jb];B[gf]LB[if:a]C[dv: hane at the head ('a') instead.]
;W[fg];B[fe];W[ef];B[eb];W[ei]C[dv: Good move by white.];B[bn]
;W[jp]C[dv: Trying to save an utterly uniportant stone. Very bad.]
;B[ip];W[io];B[lo]C[dv: This empty triangle looks like a fancy way to protect the cut. Obviously it's a very awkward move. When you think you can solve a problem with an empty triangle, think twice.]

LB[cb:a][bq:b][aq:c]C[Hm, I felt some danger for me in this sequence.

dv: The big groups are more or less settled, as are the big areas. Let the endgame begin. First, let's count.

B: About 20 points on the right and some 10+ for the other groups.

W: LR 8, LL 5+, UR 3, UL 10-, center: unclear

With komi, White has a definite advantage. The big endgame points are 'a' and 'b' or 'c'. The lower left feels like not out of danger, but I can't find any severe sequence.]

;B[fh]C[dv: good move];W[eh];B[dh]LB[ih:a]C[dv: I'd play 'a'  to reduce the center.]
;W[gh];B[hg];W[gi];B[ih]C[dv: good];W[jg]
(;B[ba]C[dv: Here the large monkey is not the best move. See var.]
;W[cb];B[ca];W[bb];B[da];W[ij];B[sg]C[I felt afraid that R10 could become a threat and the black group there would become isolated without 2 eyes.

dv: since P19 is sente, you shouldn't be afraid of being cut off on the right. Anwyay, ...]
;W[jh]C[... with white getting this move, the game is over. There is no point in securing your groups 100% if you lose the game.

The only possibility is now to kill the Lower left. I can't see a way, though.

These were my last comments for this game. A few variations follow later.

Conclusion:
-------------------

From this game I suggest a major improvement in shape and technique. At 67, 99 and two more later, you made four empty triangles, nearly all giving you problems sooner or later. At 111 you missed a snapback. At 81 you allowed Black to make an eyestealing tesuji with 94 later. At 147 lack of faith in your group's shape slowed down your game, allowing White to make a perfect shape with 148. At 89, 121 and later a hane at the head would have been better.

A minor comment: don't play the large monkey automatically. Sometimes the one space jump is severer (141) and sometimes there are opportunities to kill or live inside (129 - maybe).

One of the ways to improve shape and technique is to casually play through pro games, for example at gobase.org

Good luck !
