;W[fd];B[ec]C[I'm never really sure how to start...

You should ignore the threat for now and take another corner at D7 or G4. The stone at the 3-3 point can survive a further attack.   Simply taking three corners and building a solid wall around them  will give you more than half of the territory on the board. A solid wall from C1 to C7 and then to J7 would give you 32 points of territory on the left and top. A solid White wall from D1 to D6 and then to J6 would surround 25 points of territory. In fact, with correct play Black can do better than that.]
;W[fc];B[fb];W[gd];B[gb]C[H7 would hold the corner.];W[gg];B[eg]
C[A very small move. C6 would give you three corners to White's one.]
;W[hc];B[dd]C[Making a knight's move jump from E7 to the 3-4 point at C6 takes the corner firmly, so that White has no place to think of invading. On the other side, the jump from two stones at the bottom to C6 is also extremely strong, securing the left side. The result would be more than 30 points of territory marked out for Black, compared with less than half as much for White.]
;W[cc]C[This invasion, if successful, takes away 15-20 points of Black territory. With the Black stone at E7, White should not survive in the corner.]
;B[db]C[Since your stone at E7 bounds the invading stone on the upper side, you need to move at C6 to confine it as closely as possible on the left side.]
;W[be];B[ce]C[I figured this would kind of join my upper and lower  pieces.

Fine.];W[fh]C[White should have continued at C8 to try to gain life in the upper left corner.]
;B[fe]C[Black should attack in the upper left corner. Killing the invading stones is worth much more than pushing a little way toward the right. Even blocking at E2 is worth more.]
;W[ge];B[ff];W[gf];B[ed]C[Worth only one point. Either playing at E2 to block a White invasion or attacking the upper left corner would have won the game for you. Playing E2 and then attacking the corner would have given you a large margin of victory.]
;W[ci]C[This Monkey Jump takes away 5 points from Black, compared with Black blocking at E2.]
;B[bd]C[Good.];W[cd];B[cb]C[I had meant to play B4, but had accidently clicked the  mouse button here instead. I think this is why i lost.

Yes, B4 is the right move, but you haven't lost yet. The White stones should still die.]
;W[bc];B[bf]C[Good.];W[ad];B[df]C[Was I too defensive? Cause this allowed the com to get  a 'live' group in the upper corner.

Yes. B8 kills the White stones, which have only one eye. The difference is more than 20 points.

This defensve move at D4 is not needed, since your group has a large eye in the middle and a second eye at the top.]
;W[bb]C[White makes a second eye.];B[ba]C[There are no more life-and-death fights. What remains is the end game, that is, completing walls. In the end game, your first priority is moves like B9 that must be answered, called sente moves. Every time you make a sente move and the opponent responds, you get to choose the next target. If you make a non-threatening (gote) move, your opponent gets to choose a target.]
;W[ab]C[White must complete the second eye here or die.];B[af]
C[Another death threat. Good.];W[ae];B[dh]C[Good. Not as big as the earlier threats against the White corner group, but still threatening a stone. Capturing the White stone on C1 would also save several points of Black territory.]
;W[di]C[Necessary.];B[bh]C[White can ignore this gote (non-threatening) move. Leave gote moves for later in the endgame, when you have run out of sente moves. Here you have E2, worth one point, and H8, worth 5.]
;W[hb]C[White grabs 5 points. Now you still have two sente moves: H9, worth 4 points, and E2.]
;B[eh]C[Sente. Black can play at E1, saving 6 points, or at G9, winning two points.]
;W[ha]C[why didn't the computer play one move to the left? G9 is  it?

More to the point, why didn't it respond at E1? Two errors in one move.]
;B[ga]C[A one point gote move. E1 is a 6-point sente move. It captures 2 stones, and makes 4 points of territory at B1 C1 D1 C2. In addition, it threatens to invade at F1.]
;W[fg]C[Gote for White. E1 is still the more important move.]
;B[ei]C[Good.];W[fi];B[ca];W[dc];B[ea]C[I worry about here, white could have finished me earlier  by placing here?

E9 is not necessary. Black has 5 eyes in this group.];W[aa]
C[I lost to the computer by 2.])
