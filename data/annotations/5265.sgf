Enjoy :o)];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[qj];B[qn]C[Black 7 is the correct direction move.]
;W[qg];B[de]C[Black 9 is the biggest area move. C15 could be better in such territorial type opening.]
;W[dh];B[fe]C[Black 11 is slow when black isn't easy to attack white D12 stone.]
;W[gc]C[White has to help the corner stone, and F17 is the proper move when top side isn't that developable for both players.]
;B[he];W[ic]C[White 14 is slow. J16 is a normal move.];B[ec]
C[Black 15 is wrong. It should be at F17 first.];W[eb]C[White 16 is weak. White has to split black from E16.]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[gd];W[hc]C[This result isn't good for white, because black makes nice shape at the outside and white J17 stone isn't that useful.]
;B[cc]C[Black 21 is a very useful forcing move.];W[dd]C[White 22 isn't useful. White has to just defend at D18.]
;B[cd];W[ee];B[ef];W[ed];B[fd];W[db];B[cf]C[These exchanges are good for black.]
;W[ff]C[White 30 is the natural move to split black, otherwise all previous moves are meaningless.]
;B[eg]C[Black 31 is the best move.];W[gf]C[White 32 is the best way to help his cutting stone.]
;B[hf]C[Black 33 is an important spot.];W[gh];B[eh]C[Black 35 is a must.
White then has to play at H13 that is important for both players...]

(;W[cm]C[White 36 is a big move but it is slack in this moment.]
;B[jq]C[Black 37 is the biggest area move. K4 could be better when there are two weak groups in the center area.]
;W[mc]C[White 38 isn't important. White has to help his weak group from H13 first.
Also, black next has to play at H13...]
(;B[jd]C[Black 39 isn't that useful.];W[me]C[White 40 is a good way to help weak stone, it also puts pressure on black.]
;B[jg]C[Black 41 is slack. H13 is still the correct move.];W[fh]
C[White 42 isn't necessary. White has to jump out at G10 directly.]
;B[ei]C[This exchange is good for black.];W[ji]C[White 44 is an overplay. White has to run away at G10.]
;B[ii]C[Black 45 is a strong move to punish white's weakness.]
;W[ih];B[jh];W[ij];B[hi]C[White lost the control.];W[ig];B[if]
C[Black 51 is right -- liberty is important than shape.];W[hh]
C[White is in trouble since black next move can defend at G10.]

(;B[hj]C[This move is slack.];W[gj]C[Now white will be able to escape.
L11 is the proper next move for black...]
(;B[jj]C[Black 55 is wrong.];W[ki]C[This exchange hurts black top side weak group.]
;B[ik];W[fj];B[lg]C[Black 59 is the best defense.];W[lh]C[White 60 is a nice forcing move.]
;B[mg]C[Black 61 looks natural, it is wrong, because white can play at L13 to split black... Instead of 61 at N14 is the correct move for black.]

(;W[kk]C[White 62 is a loose move.];B[jc]C[Now black starts attack first.]
;W[oe]C[White 64 is thin. O14 is the proper way to run out.]
;B[nd]C[Black 65 isn't right, because white can connect at O15 next... Q14 is the way for black to split white.]

(;W[md]C[White 66 is a heavy play.];B[ne]C[Now black's play is severe.]
;W[nf];B[mf]C[Black 69 splits white and also defends weakness at L13, too.]
;W[pc]C[White 70 is a common tesuji.];B[od]C[Black 71 is the best defense.]
;W[ob];B[pd];W[pb];B[og]C[This result is good for black.];W[kj]
C[White 76 is solid but slow. White has to defend at N8.];B[lb]
;W[mb];B[jb]C[Black 79 is a nice forcing move.];W[ke];B[jf]
;W[hd];B[je];W[rc]C[White 84 has to defend at S18.];B[ge];W[ga]
;B[rd]C[Now black has a very useful forcing move with 87, it hurts white right side group.]
;W[rb];B[im]C[Black 89 is the best. Black doesn't have any weakness. White has three weak groups on the whole board.]
;W[nh];B[ng];W[on]C[White 92 is an overplay because white is behind.]
;B[pl]C[Black 93 is the proper move locally. Black could play at D8 to attack white's weaker group first.]
;W[nl]C[Q10 is the proper follow up move for black...]
(;B[pn]C[Black 95 is passive.];W[jo]C[White 96 is another overplay.]
;B[dm]C[Black 97 is doable. Black has to just defend at J5, white doesn't have severe follow up move overthere.]
;W[fm]C[Now the situation is complecate.];B[dk]C[Black 99 isn't right. Black has to help weak stone at D8.]
;W[hn]C[White 100 makes a nice shape. White may find a chance to win this game.
Black next move should have play at G8 first...]
(;B[gk]C[This is the wrong order.];W[ej];B[dj]C[Black 103 is a normal answer which is really big. Black may consider to split white at F9.]
;W[el];B[gl]C[Black 105 isn't useful if black won't be able to save his center group.]
;W[ek];B[dl]C[Black 107 is so big, but his center group will be die.]
;W[jl];B[il];W[jk];B[do]C[Black 111 is a useful forcing move.]
;W[fo];B[em]C[Black 113 isn't necessary. Black has to just play at C4.]
;W[fl];B[cp];W[cq]C[White 116 is a strong move.];B[co];W[oq]
C[White 118 is a bad timing. White has to defend at D3 first.]
;B[ep]C[Black 119 is strong.];W[dq];B[eq]C[It is really painful for white.]
;W[er]C[Black then must block at F2...]
(;B[eo]C[Black 123 is so weak.];W[fr]C[Now white is comfortable.]
;B[gp];W[hp];B[op]C[Black 127 is the best response.];W[nq];B[np]
C[Black 129 is ok when the center is so valuable. Otherwise black has to defend at Q2.]
;W[pr];B[qr]C[Black 131 is too much. Black has to defend at R3.]
;W[qq];B[pp];W[rr];B[qp];W[qs];B[lp]C[White gains.];W[lo]C[White 138 is a good defense.]
;B[mo];W[ln];B[mq]C[Black 141 is important.];W[rp]C[White 142 is urgent.]
;B[hq];W[ip];B[gr];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[nj]C[Black 149 is the best way to threat white's weakness.]
;W[rl]C[White 150 is a valuable defense.];B[pj]C[Black 151 will help white stronger. Black has to squeeze white from S13.]
;W[qi];B[sg]C[S14 is the proper move locally.];W[rf]C[Now white has useful forcing move.]
;B[sf];W[pf]C[White 156 is too soon, because black then can peep at S12.]
;B[of];W[se];B[re];W[sh];B[sd];W[rg];B[qk]C[Black 163 isn't useful.]
;W[rk];B[fn];W[gn];B[en];W[gm];B[mm]C[Black 169 is clever.]
;W[mn];B[nm];W[ao]C[White 172 isn't a good timing. White has to play at O6 first, black will answer at P7, white then defend at M8.]
;B[an];W[ap];B[in]C[Black 175 is wrong, black must try something, otherwise black is losing.]
;W[io];B[km];W[lm];B[kn];W[ko];B[ll];W[kl];B[lk]C[Something is happened, but it is still difficult for black.]
;W[mh];B[oh];W[kh];B[ni];W[hk]C[White 188 is too fancy, it may be a losing move. White has to just regularly reduce black's liberty from H7.]
;B[hl]C[Black gains a liberty by this exchange.];W[gi];B[lj]
;W[ij];B[ib];W[hb];B[jj];W[hm];B[kg];W[ij];B[ia];W[ha];B[jj]
;W[jn];B[jm];W[ij];B[qc];W[qb];B[jj];W[dg];B[df];W[ij];B[sc]
;W[sb];B[jj]C[Black has more Ko-threat.];W[nb]C[White is in trouble. Even though white 214 erases a threat, but it isn't enough.]
;B[mi]C[It is a regular Ko. Black got the chance to win the game.]
;W[ij];B[rq]C[Black 217 is ok. S12 is another severe threat.]
;W[hk]C[White has no choice.];B[qr]C[Ko again. White still lacks threat.]
;W[mr];B[qq]C[Black 221 is a solid move.];W[lr];B[or]C[Black 223 isn't necessary. Black has to just defend at L3, that is the best way to kill white.]
;W[nr];B[ps];W[kq]C[Now white got a chance to save his five stones.]
;B[kp];W[jr];B[lq]C[Black 229 is a big mistake, it will lose an important liberty. Black has to just defend at J3.]
;W[kr];B[iq]C[Now black must defend at G3.];W[jp];B[mp];W[fq]
C[It hurts black badly.];B[nn];W[ho];B[fp];W[gq]C[White got big profit by saving his weak group.]
;B[bn];W[cb]C[Finally white is winning.];B[bb];W[ba];B[bc]C[A18 is the correct answer.]
