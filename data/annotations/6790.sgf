C[Thanks for reviewing the game for me. I played black.  Would you mind to give suggestions on moves where you think a bigger extension would be better or a better move gobally would be better? Also, could you point out which move is a crude style? I want to improve my weakness. I would appreciate any advice about my game.]
;B[dp];W[cq]TR[cl][cm][cn][do][dq][eq][er]C[ufo: Hi, im your reviewer. Please note that im no expert on joseki. I will try to give some hints though. Im about 5k on KGS and 8k EGF, so I'm no senseis...;-) Don't blindly believe what I say.

This is considered bad for white, since it is to early in the game. As a general concept try not to get closed in by your opponent. Here white is obviously getting closed in without need. There are other free corners.

The outside influence will be benificial for B. This kind of stuff might sound a bit irritating if you hear it to much without knowing how to use that influence. Basically, it will pay for itself. You don't have to cash it immediately.

In general it will help you to play more efficient, because large connected groups are more efficient in making territory than locked in groups. It will also help you in fights, as the proverb says "large groups don't die". Obviously, the larger a group is, the more places it might help other groups connect to it, more places where it's influence might be used to cut opponents groups etc...]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm]LB[cm:B][bn:A]C[ufo: oops, there is no need to weaken yourself and create a cutting point. The second line is not good for white to crawl further on. It is called the line of defeat. The reason for A is that otherwise Black can play there in sente making a very good shape. Other than that it is bad for W.

B is the normal answer.];W[dr];B[er]LB[cm:C][do:B][eq:A]C[ufo: now you have three cutting points already. See variation.]

(;W[ds]LB[cr:A]C[ufo: this is not common. A is the normal respons which leaves endgame potential for white. This line of play lets black completely close their wall.]
;B[es];W[br];B[eq]LB[eo:B][fp:A]C[ufo: I would consider A or B here to defend the cut a little wider. I think i would choos B because it defends 2 cuts.]
;W[cd];B[pp]C[ufo: good, extend from your wall.];W[pc];B[pe]
C[ufo: good again. Let's evaluate. White has 9 points in the lower left. Black has a huge double wing formation. Black is definitely on the better hand. White will have to invade, which means playing near you thickness, which is ineffecient.]
;W[nq]LB[qn:A]C[ufo: with all modesty, I think this is the wrong side. Playing at A would allow white to develop in the open space at the right, which puts some pressure on the the stone at Q15 and separetes it from it's ally at the bottom right. Its also violating the play away from thickness principle. This way, white creates more weak groups allowing black to keep everything connected.]
;B[oq]LB[jp:A][lp:D][kq:B][lq:E][pr:C]C[ufo: this move is usually played when you have a stone around A. When W plays O4 and later has to make base, they find themselves overconcentrated. The advantage you have made is by stopping W from extending to C and thus reducing your corner, or making the corner a bit harder to invade. In this case, it seems that are not your priorities...

I might have played a pincer at D or E.];W[np];B[jq]LB[po:A]
[kp:B]C[ufo: Now it is a bit inconvenient to pince, because white can start to close in your corner by playing at A and you'll be facing a difficult fight in the corner. This is really a basic rule: Don't have your corners enclosed, and enclose  your opponents if you can. 

Also I would play B instead of k3 since you are playing quite close to the big wall and not putting enough pressure on the white stones.]
;W[kq];B[jp]C[ufo: this seems a bit to sweet for my taste. I would hane. (attach-hane). Of course 25 min sudden death could lead to a safer style of playing i suppose.]
;W[kp]LB[po:A]C[ufo: A is still the direction. The four white stone at the bottom are obviously overconcentrated.]
;B[rd]LB[qc:B][rc:A][nd:C][pn:D]C[ufo: I have never seen this. You invest 2 moves in this corner vs white's one, and you still leave them A to grab the corner?  B or C are more common joseki. If you want to maintain more flexibility, it might be an idea to split the last unfinished corner in the top left, but before all that, D is absolutely mandatory. Urgent moves before big moves. Especially after the developments on the bottom, white's group is overconcentrated, so it is not effecient for making points, but it might be well suited for fighting...]
;W[qd]LB[rc:B][nd:A]C[ufo: I don't like this move. W does not gain anything. I would first get out at A, and later aim at B. Here this makes bad shape by pushing into your opponent while making them stronger.]
;B[qe];W[rc]LB[re:A][rf:B]C[ufo: This is gote. don't answer. Later in the endgame white might capture the stone in a sequence A-B, but that is often gote again, if black has developped more strength on the right by then.]

(;B[re]C[ufo: See variation];W[nc]C[ufo: good];B[ec];W[dc]
(;B[eb]C[ufo: in fuseki, the second line is usually no-go zone... try to develop your group a bit higher like in the variation.]

(;W[db]C[ufo: See Var.];B[ic]
(;W[kc];B[qi];W[qo]LB[po:A]C[ufo: Such middle game fighting is always very difficult. Im not very good at it either. I've always seen it done at A instead of R5. Don't ask me definite follow up's, but it seems to me that B should now cut at A to prevent being locked in, giving white yet another isolated group that will have to live on the side. Note that the white group at the bottom is not yet compeletely alive and that making black stronger at A is bound to have some costs at later times...]
;B[qp];W[po];B[op];W[oo];B[no]C[ufo: Are you sure the corner lives? Because if you would happen not to come out this fight in sente, white might attack it...]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[ql];B[on]C[ufo: what does this move do?  The exchange makes white stronger and you weaker...]
;W[pm];B[nl]
(;W[ok]
(;B[pn]LB[pn:A][qn:B]C[ufo: This is even worse. lose one liberty and fortify the white group...]
;W[qn];B[mn];W[lo];B[kn];W[ln];B[lm];W[ko];B[jn];W[jo];B[io]

(;W[cg]C[ufo: This is no time for tenuki. The white group is not alive, neither is the black corner, and black has a lot of cutting points.

white has so many possibilities here... I don't know which is best. I would say, preferably kill the black corner, and if not, catch a black group on the outside.

I don't immediately find a definite way to kill the black corner, so here are some variations on how white could attack the outside...]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[jr];W[or];B[pr];W[os];B[ps];W[mr];B[mq]C[ufo: I wonder what this move does??? White is unconditionally alive already, so throwing stones inside won't change that.]

(;W[lq];B[in];W[rp];B[qq];W[rq];B[rr]
(;W[qj]
(;B[ri];W[rj]LB[oi:A]C[ufo: likewise, i would prefer A. The second line is endgame.]
;B[pj]LB[oi:A]C[ufo: This pushing into the opponent is bad style. Jumping to A seems much more interesting. Amongst other benefits A gives you a better chance at closing in the white group.]
;W[pk];B[ee];W[cl];B[cm];W[dl];B[em];W[dm]C[ufo: bad, don't push into your opponent if the only result is you losing liberties.]
;B[dn];W[el];B[fm];W[bj];B[bl];W[bk]LB[ck:A]C[ufo: After reducing your own liberties, maybe better connect at A.]

;B[ef];W[if];B[hf];W[ed];B[fd];W[dd];B[fc]LB[ea:B][fb:A]C[ufo: Playing at A instead will make the endgame move at B gote for white.]

;W[ka];B[an];W[bp];B[ao]C[ufo: gote again. Last comment.

Conclusion:

* Don't get your corners and other groups enclosed by the opponent, and enclose theirs.
* Don't push into your opponent for the sake of reducing your own liberties.
* Study the endgame. ( elementary go series has a good book on the endgame, that I read when I was about your level)
* Remember that it is a game about life and death, and not about points. Don't take so much chances with weak groups and corners.
* For white, it is considered bad manners to try and win on time in the end of a sudden death game.]
