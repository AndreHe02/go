C[Overall, it seems you missed some opportunities through misreads.  Also, your opening against sanrensei could use a bit of work.]

(;W[dj]TR[nc][nq]C[Usually it's quite hard to play against sanrensei with your own sanrensei as white.  You should consider approaching instead.

I've shown a normal continuation for sanrensei in the variation.]
;B[jp];W[jd];B[jj]C[Decidedly better for black.  The next white move is hard to find.  Normally against a double wing, you want to invade 3-3.  Since black has tengen, it will be difficult to do.  On the other hand, black can invade white's double wing with 3-3 and feel ok.]
;W[jn];B[gp]C[This is a strange way to play for black.  There really isn't a followup for him here.  Not quite an approach of the corner, and not quite an attack on white's reduction move.  There's a distinction between indecision and dual purpose that often gets lost.  A move is not dual purpose if it compromises.  It needs to serve both purposes well.]
;W[kp]TR[gn]C[This move can be worthwhile for two reasons.

1. If the crosscut is good for you.  It looks interesting, but I think black will have an advantage.
2. If you are happy with just a reduction.

To me, I don't like either option so I would probably play marked as white to preserve the aji for later.]
;B[kq];W[lp]C[Feels like black should let you reduce here while he makes territory.]

Killing the middle seems overly ambituous.  If you just want to fight, what do you hope to gain?  Black already has a lot of territory.]
