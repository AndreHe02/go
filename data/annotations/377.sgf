enjoyed looking at this game.  I have marked key points with the sun sign,
as in this diagram

As a general rule, middle game moves affect the life and death of groups.

Black has been outfought.  White is now strong on the outside.

invasion.]HO[1]

The two weak ê moves have lead to a large loss.

White can not expect much in the center because of the weakness at d and
the strong black stones at ê

In general, you don't want to make territory from thickness.  Use it for
fighting.

I would be patient and restart the fuseki by playing at b or c.  Or you
could play d to increase your thickness and hope to lure black into
fighting.]HO[1]
