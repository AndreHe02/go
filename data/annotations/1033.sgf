C[SGF file created by TurboGo for Windows 95 v4.01];B[dd]C[20k? verses 20k?  I was black.

Hi, I'm a beginner at go.  I've never played a
human being and I understand that that is probably
the most important thing for me to start doing.
However in the mean time, I have regestered
turbogo, and here is a game of mine against its
top level.  I won, just, if komi=0.5.

I havn't put comments against any of the other moves.
I'm interested to know what my worst moves are.
I suspect my tactical ability will improve by itself as I play more, so
comments about my strategic faults would be most welcome. Of course
any tactical hints would be welcome too.

Thanks very much,   Tom.


Vince:

Hello Tom, I play as vin on the Internet GoServer where I am an 8k. First of all I would like to say that you are doing pretty well if you have never played against a human player. I agree, you do need to start playing people rather than computers. Computer opponents can be helpful when you are starting out, but they are not that strong and will teach you bad habits.   Seeing as you must have Internet access to reach the GTL, then I suggest that you have a look at the go servers especially IGS or NNGS.

If you don't understand or disagree with any of my comments then please email me.

I have made my comments using the sgf editor WinMGT, which is easily obtainable off the Internet. I have marked various points on the board using letters and symbols, plus added some variations. If you can't see these with your sgf reader then it may be a good idea to obtain an editor that can. Sorry I don't mean to teach you to suck eggs :-)]
;W[pq];B[cp];W[qd];B[qj]LB[od:a][oc:b][ep:c][po:d][qo:e]C[Vince:
While I can't say this is a bad move it is more the sort of move that is played by white. Common moves in this position are "a" to "e" in no particular order. This is perhaps a question of style, but here I would play either "a" or "c".]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[ci]C[Vince:
This is a fairly common sequence. Fine so far.];B[cm]C[Vince: This struck me as an odd move. It looks to be trying to restrict white from extending down from the left side. However white is quite low (on the third line) so is not likely to get a large amount of territory here.   Also blacks position is rather low as well. Generally you should try to get a balance between stones on the third and fourth lines.]
;W[oc];B[gp]LB[jp:a][jq:b]C[Vince:
This is too narrow, ie too close to the stones you already have in the left corner. A better move would be at the points a or b.

There is also the future of your solitary stone on the right side to consider.]

(;W[jc]C[Vince:
White should really attack the single black stone on the right. See the variation.]
;B[ic]LB[qg:a][qm:b][qp:c]C[Vince:
I am not sure what you are trying to do here! Are you trying to attack white or give more elbow room to your stones in the top left corner. Your corner stones are ok for the moment. I would be more concerned about your stone on the right at point R10.   I would play at the point marked a or b. Point "a" limits whites ability to extend from the corner. But point "b" leaves room for a subsequent extension to either point a or c, depending on whites reponse.]
;W[qo]LB[qh:a][qm:b]C[Vince:
White should really make a move closer to blacks stone to restrict its scope to extend. Again white "a" followed by black "b" then this move would have been much better for white.   Notice that white "a" is an extension from whites corner position as well as an attack on black. Dual purpose moves like this are generally very desirable.]
;B[kp]C[Vince:
This is a big point, ie worth quite a few points, but the your stone on the right urgently needs strengthening, which will also limit whites possibilities on the right.]
;W[bc]C[Vince:
Again white should attack on the right.];B[qm]C[Vince:
At last, good. There is no immediate need to answer white in the top left corner.]
;W[nq];B[qg]C[Vince:
These stones are now pretty secure and should have no trouble living. White definately should have given you a much harder time on this side of the board.]
;W[md];B[df]LB[mo:a][no:b][on:c][dj:d]C[Vince:
Here you had a free choice where to play as whites last move did not require you to answer it.   When this happens you need to look at the whole board and consider what to do next. Should you attack or defend, or try to find a move that does both. You also need to consider where you would like to make territory and what your opponent would like to do.

In this position you are not likely to make much territory on the upper side due to whites positions on either side of your stones. But then white isn't likely to get much here either.

You have much better prospects on the bottom. Moves like a, b or c would help to confine white to the bottom right corner while helping to expand your own framework on the bottom and right sides.

Another idea is a move at point d.];W[ce];B[de];W[cb];B[db]
;W[on]C[Vince:
White is out into the centre reducing your possibilities for expansion.]

(;B[ol]C[Vince:
The wrong side, see the variation for one possible continuation.]
;W[mm];B[mk]LB[km:a]C[Vince:
Point "a" would have been better again, as you have more scope for making territory at the bottom than on the right side. Your stones on the right side are not in immediate danger.]
;W[nm];B[nl]C[Vince:
Same as previous comment];W[ck];B[jb]LB[km:a]C[Vince:
Point "a" is much bigger, ie worth much more.];W[bl];B[bm]LB[km:a]
[jd:b][kc:c][kd:d][lc:e]C[Vince:
I would probable have ignored this move. White can trim you down a bit in this area, but you can gain more elsewhere on the board. Point "a" is still a good move.

Also black "b", white "c", black "d" and white "e" would be good for black.]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[fm]LB[km:a][el:b][em:c][ek:d]C[Vince:
If you had played at point "a" earlier, you could now have considered fighting with black "b", white "c", black "d", when a black stone at "a" would help to prevent whites 2 stones connecting to the right.]
;B[en];W[el];B[im]LB[jd:a][kc:b][kd:c][lc:d][lf:e]C[Vince:
There is not much point trying to keep two of your oppenents groups apart when they are both alive.

Something like black "a", white "b", black "c", white "d", black "e" would have been better.]
;W[kl];B[km];W[jm];B[jl];W[ll];B[gn];W[rn];B[rm];W[lr];B[kr]
;W[lq];B[kq];W[jn]
(;B[jo]C[Vince:
I think you could have captured these two white stones, see the variation.]
;W[kn]LB[in:a][il:b]C[Vince:
White "a" threatening "b"  would have been better for white.]
;B[in];W[il];B[jk]C[Vince:
In this situation you have to consider is it worth saving one stone? If this stone is an important cutting stone that makes some of your opponents stones weak, or is an essential defensive stone for your group, or has other potential usefulness then the answer is yes.

Otherwise look for a move that can gain you more points elsewhere.]
;W[nf];B[og];W[je]LB[jd:a]C[Vince:
Compare this position to the suggestions I made earlier regarding a play at point "a".]
;B[ie];W[jd];B[id];W[kb];B[jf]LB[ib:a]C[Vince:
Good, it is not necessary to defend the stone at point K18.]
;W[lf];B[lg]LB[re:a][gl:b][dg:c][ln:d]C[Vince:
I didn't like this move, it leaves too many weak points on either side of it.

You want to be looking at moves that enlarge your area a little bit and reduce the opponents at the same time if possible. Examples are the points a, b, c or d.]

;W[ng]LB[nh:a];B[nh];W[lj];B[mj];W[ji];B[ii];W[ij];B[gi]LB[ih:a]
[hi:b]C[Vince:
Not a good move. Again you have too many weak points that white can exploit here. White can atari you at "a" or "b" for instance and push into your area.]
;W[ik]LB[ih:a][hi:b][if:c];B[eh]LB[ih:a][hi:b][if:c]C[Vince:
You still have a weak spot at "a", if white plays there and you answer at "b" then white "c" captures 3 stones.]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[qe];W[pd];B[pe];W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[oe]
;W[nd];B[of]LB[ln:a][lm:b][ko:c][mo:d][mp:e][ih:f]C[Vince:
A bit slow, this is not an essential move at this point, white cant push through and you can gain more points elsewhere.

For example black "a", white "b", black "c", white connects to the left of "b" followed by black "d" or "e".

Of course the weak spot at "f" still remains.];W[ej];B[hl];W[hi]

(;B[io]C[Vince:
Is it necessary ? You can't afford to make unnecessary moves, especially in a close game. If white plays here then black can easily defend his position, see the variation.]
;W[bb];B[da];W[gk]
(;B[fn]C[Vince:
Try to make moves that your opponent must answer, especially in the endgame.  See the variation for an example.]

;W[ek];B[di];W[cj];B[pn];W[po];B[qn];W[ro];B[om];W[jj]C[Vince:
A most unnecessary move by white.];B[cl];W[bk]
(;B[dk]C[Vince:
Achieves very little at this point! Yes you can now force white to capture the 3 black stones in the centre but that only gains you one point and it can wait a while.

See the variation.];W[ks];B[js];W[ls];B[ir]C[Vince:
Compared to the variation a couple of moves back you have lost 2 points here and white has gained 2 for a total difference of 4 points. In a very close game that can make all the difference.]
;W[ne];B[gj];W[hk];B[ml];W[sm];B[sl];W[sn];B[rl];W[am];B[an]
;W[al];B[bn]C[Vince:
Notice how white has trimmed you down a little in the last few moves, and each time you couldn't afford not to answer letting white keep the advantage of the move (sente).]
;W[sf];B[sg];W[se];B[ha];W[cd];B[dc];W[ca];B[em]LB[gl:a]C[Vince:
This achieves nothing, at least a play at "a" reduces whites territory by one point.]
;W[gl];B[oh]C[Vince:
Before playing in your own area like this you have to very carefully try to determine whether or not it is really necessary. It can be difficult at first until your reading ability gets more advanced.

But if it is not necessary then it is one point thrown away. Of course if it is necessary and you neglect to play it then it could cost you the game :-)]
;W[mg];B[od];W[nn];B[ko];W[lm];B[tt];W[kk]LB[ia:a]C[Vince:
There is still the point "a" to be played to redue white by one more point.

All in all not a bad game for someone who has never played against a human player.

Basically you need to keep the following in mind:

1.  try and find moves that serve more than one purpose if you can.   2. Trying to retain the advantage of the move (sente) is extremely important and can make a huge difference.

3. Try to avoid playing unnecessary moves, (I know, easier said than done)

I hope the comments prove helpful to you. If you would like me to comment any more of your games you can send them directly to me. However I would still send a copy on to the Go Teaching Ladder.

Have fun playing Go.
