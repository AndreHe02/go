Hi Joshua,

Thank you for sending me this game to review. It was an interesting game in which you played well, but in the end lost because of some technical mistakes rather than strategically wrong decisions.

When sending a game for review, be sure to include whether you played black or white. Also, it helps the reviewer out quite a bit if you formulate some questions about the game, or include a quick analysis of the game yourself: where do you think you made mistakes, what moves did you not understand, or know how to react to, etc...

I added a strategical analysis of your game, as well as some things which might help you improve in the future. Hope you enjoy the review. If you have any remaining questions, you can contact me on KGS, my username is Hushfield.

;B[fq]C[H: A standard opening and a good approach move.];W[eq]
C[H: This is an opportunity for black. White wishes to play the exchange as found in the variation]
(;B[fo]LB[fp:A]C[H: This is a matter of good and bad shape. Don't ever one space jump from a contact play like this. (Try to read out why before looking at the variation).

Black tenuki, as well as black ikken tobi (one space jump) produce horrible results for black. Therefore, black should almost invariably answer with A instead.]
(;W[cn]LB[fp:A]C[H: White doesn't take advantage of A, and plays defensively (trying to claim the corner territory)]
;B[cf]C[H: Marker];W[ce];B[df]C[H: yes, better form, better result]
;W[gc]LB[cc:A]TR[dd][ce][cf][df]C[H: White plays too wide and leaves black with opportunities in the corner. Whenever you encounter this shape, remember to check the the point at A, and read ahead from there. You will often find good results for black.]
;B[cj]LB[ch:A]C[H: Again, the correct response. I like playing the third line here bbecause it is more stable, and you are closer to white positions. Don't fear the white invasion at A, welcome it. Because then white has to fight at a disadvantge: namely in your sphere of influence.]
(;W[nc];B[pf]LB[qf:A]C[H: A is another possibility, but I like this move.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb]
(;B[qd]C[H: See variation for another way of handling this.]
;W[ob];B[bl]LB[pk:A][jp:B]C[H: At such an early stage of the game, it's not enough to take a few points of profit. You should always be able to justify a move in terms of:
- Does it attack my opponent's stones?
- Does it protect my stones if they are not yet settled?
- Does it help me create a large-scale framework?

This move belongs to the late middlegame, early endgame. Also playing on the second line (the line of defeat) at such an early stage in the game should only be done when trying to live in your opponents territory. Bigger moves at this point would be A or B.]
;W[qn];B[ql]LB[qi:A][pj:B]C[H: I like the pincer here, if you can build up some pressure on the white stone, you can later retract to points like a or b and secure a large part of the board.]
(;W[qq]LB[qp:A][pq:B]C[H: Now there should be only one question in your mind: "Do I play A or B?" The answer to this lies in the surrounding black position. When both sequences are played out, which will give you a larger potential outside area? The bottom side or the right side?]
(;B[qp]C[H: The right direction.];W[pq]
(;B[oq]C[H: This hane has been engrained in your memory from countless 3-3 invasions and the proverb "hane at the head of two stones". Whenever you play the hane, however, you give your opponent a chance to cut. So you should always remember to check whether the cut is threatening. Turns out that in this situation, it is.]
(;W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lq]C[H: White is pushing from behind on the second line (called the line of defeat because it gives her almost no points, but grants black solid outside influence.) You are correct in not playing hane here, but just keep extending.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[sp]
(;B[so];W[rr]
(;B[ao]LB[qo:A]C[I think it was too soon in the game to play this monkey jump.  There are bigger points available, such as Q11 or thereabouts.

H: Indeed, this is a typical large endgame move. There are still other big points on the board, but more importantly, you skipped a crucial defensive move at A.]
(;W[bp]LB[qo:A]TR[cn][dp]C[H: White reinforces with a flexible shape. Notice how white doesn't immediately attack the weak point at A, but first makes sure she has no weak groups of her own. This is a golden rule: don't go fishing while your house is on fire. Meaning: if you fix your own weaknesses first, you can attack with a free mind and won't be confronted with earlier sloppiness at later stages in the mliddlegame.]
;B[dm]LB[en:A]TR[df][cj][fo]C[H: I like the idea of shutting white in, and trying to build a framework, but Black's potential is on the right side, not the left. Furthermore, there is still an opening at A.]
;W[je];B[mf]C[H: Works very well with the right side.];W[pj]
C[This Q10 stone is the one that gives me the most trouble in this game.  I consistently take the wrong approach to trying to enclose it, as you will see.]
(;B[ol];W[rk]
(;B[qi]C[H: I don't think this is the right way to attack white. See variations for other ideas.]

;B[jq];W[ni];B[li]LB[qj:A]C[H: I would say that your play is pretty normal. you make the right moves to defend the lower side group, then proceed to attack the center white stones. Had you connected at A, there would have been even less opportunities for white, but you are in a comfortable position. white should not get out of here alive, and you are now ahead by quite a lot.]
;W[nf]
(;B[nd]LB[ne:A][ng:B]C[H: I like how you're trying to go for a large-scale capture, but this move is not the best. Try going for A, or even B instead.]
;W[qh]C[H: White is getting desperate now]
(;B[qg]TR[qi]C[H: I get how you're trying to defend your upper right side group at the same time, but this move is not good. It is inviting white to cut your two marked stones. Instead, you should have played the variation.]
;W[qj]C[H: White takes advantage of another deficiency in the black position, and the game goes downhill for black from here.

Let's end the review here, because the rest are more technical issues, rather than strategical questions. You showed superior strategical insight (building the right frameworks, blocking the 3-3 invasion in the lower right from the correct side, etc...) which gave you an advantage. Your opponent, however, managed to exploit a lack of tactical expertise: you left cutting points unguarded, chose some suboptimal attacking moves, etc. 

So the biggest limiting factor to further improvement right now would be your reading ability, and knowledge of good and bad shape. You can remedy this by doing a lot of tsumego (both life and death and tesuji problems). I recommend the following books, if you can get hold of them.

- Kano Yoshinori: Graded Go Problems for Beginners, vol. 1 (too easy for you already)
- Kano Yoshinori: Graded Go Problems for Beginners, vol. 2
- Kano Yoshinori: Graded Go Problems for Beginners, vol. 3
- Davies, James: Elementary Go Series, vol. 3: Tesuji
- Davies, James: Elementary Go Series, vol. 4: Life and Death

Don't be put off by the diffculty of the Davies books, they are quite advanced and you will probably be a very strong single digit kyu or even a dan player before you have mastered every technique in those two volumes.

Keep on playing, I have browsed through your KGS games and seen how much you have improved in only such a short time. You are doing very well, and if you can improve your reading and knowledge of shape, you will be a single digit kyu in no time. Have fun, and I hope this review helps. 

Sincerely,
Hushfield
