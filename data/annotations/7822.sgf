C[Hi,

Thanks in advance for this review.

 I'm playing black on this game, white was new on this server and this 5k wasn't confirmed yet so I can't say anything about his level. Mine is not regular, turning between 3 and 5k KGS.

Although I won it, I think I made a lot of mistakes in this game, without speaking of the yose where I use to be bad at it... I love so much fighting that my games rarely go to this stage. Any comments you think that can be helpful to improve my game would be welcome.

Regards,
Flo];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[ce];W[od];B[mc];W[kc]C[This move is very unusual by white and probably a mistake. Black can simply take the corner by playing P17]

C[At this point I like O17 for black since it keeps the white stone split and forces white to live in the corner. Lots of other moves keep white split. Any of A-D keep white split and black will get a decent result from.]
(;B[pd];W[mb];B[nc];W[nb];B[oc]TR[qm][qn]C[My personal preference for whtie on this side is one of these.]
;W[pj]LB[pl:A][ql:B][qm:D][qn:E]C[I would be satisfied of the result if I get sente for approaching LR. Did I ask for too much? I think I missed something in this l17 counter pincer.

You definitely missed something in the L17 counter pincer as the sequences I showed give what hopefully seems to be better results for black.

I don't like white's extension this far and this high. As black is very thick in the top right, there is no problem for black to invade the extension with a move at any of A - E. My personal preference for solid play would be white extending no farther than R7.

White is too high because, if white were lower he could more easily make a base.]
(;B[cn]C[Extending from a corner enclosure on the most open side is definitely a good move in the next biggest area on the board.]
;W[fp];B[dj];W[kq]C[I prefer at this point to try getting into white's sphere of influence with a move that separates the lower right stone from the right star point.]
(;B[qp];W[qq];B[qo]C[The pushing seuqnece that followed went badly for black because black did not separate the white stone on the right side from it's allies on the lower side.]

(;B[qj];W[qi];B[qk]TR[em][kn][bp]C[These three moves look nice to me for white at this point in terms of developing the bottom side. Corner moves like B4 are worth a lot of points and are solid and make the black extension nearby weak. L6 and E7 are simple logical shapes for expanding the moyo.]
;W[im]C[This is an awkward jump as if black just wanted to reduce he could play some place like G5.]

(;W[fd]TR[ge][ff][gf]C[I might also consider these three points.

The question of white direction to push the opponent is often difficult. If you push from the right you'll make a wall towards the top right center. If you push from the left you'll solidify a little more territory on the left.

I am inclined to think pushing from the right is best here. I like G14 best.]

;W[jc]
(;B[jd];W[lc]C[No need to block a push at M16, it doesn't really threaten to cut black at all. Black should play H18.]

(;B[cj]C[A white connect at Q11 is slightly better as it doesn't let blak crawl towards the top.]
