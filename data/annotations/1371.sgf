C[Dear reviewer,

thank you very much for spending your time on my game. I was in for a total destruction in this game. ;-)

It seems that I made everything wrong from the start. I tried to catch up, but it came out that I missed the important points. It would be great, if you could give me some advice...

I added some comments, too. (I played White)

Thank you very much, Joerg.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[cg]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dd];W[ce]C[Maybe this is the first big mistake. (I hope the pincer was ok...)
Black is able to build good strength wich will support his stone in the upper right.
Maybe I should have played an extension to E17 ???

HK:  White 10.  This is right move.]
(;B[ec]C[HK:  Black 11.  Not good move.  Refer to the variation.  It is a basic joseki sequence.]

C[HK:  Black 13.  Black should capture at D18.];W[bb];B[db]
;W[df]C[HK:  Not so bad now for white.];B[ef]C[HK:  Black 17.  around J17 is better.]
;W[eg]C[I am trying to build up my own strength, but Blacks is bigger.
Should I play an approach earlier???];B[fg]
(;W[fh]C[???

HK:  White 20.  Cut  at F14 is better.   See the variation.]

;B[fi];W[ee]C[They say the ponnuki is worth 30 points...
Hm, but I could break his wall. So did he with mine...

HK:  I think Black's ponnuki is bigger.]
(;B[hd]C[HK:  Black 27.  Around H14 is good.

See the variation.];W[nc]C[That was not a good move at all I think. He  was able to pincer me with full support of his righthand group.
Where would you have played in this position?

White 28.  White should move at H14 instead.];B[lc]
(;W[ld]C[I am trying to come out and do something against a potential moyo. Maybe I am too afraid, but I don't like the jump into the corner.

HK:  White should move at H14 also now.  Let's try a variation.]
;B[mc]
(;W[nd]C[Is this move correct?

HK:  White 32.  I would move at N16.  See the variation.];B[md]
;W[ne];B[pf]
(;W[pb]C[HK:  White 36.  White should move at N15.  Refer to the variation.]

C[Now I tried to counter a second black wall...]
(;B[of]C[HK:  Black 55.  R12 is far better.  See the variations.]

C[ok, ich werde untenrum verbinden!];B[ph];W[sg]C[I connect at the edge...]
;B[og];W[sf];B[pg]C[HK:  Black 65.  H14 instead is better.]
;W[hf]C[No I realized that Black is developing enormous influece. This move is maybe to small to accomplish anything.

Your choice??

HK:  White 66.  Good.];B[je]C[HK:  Black 67.  Black should move at around K4 instead.]
;W[jp]C[HK:  White 68.  Good.  White is getting advantage.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[dr]C[HK:  Black 71.  K3 instead is better.];W[hq]

;W[gg]C[Hm, I can't remember what I thought this move would be good for.

HK:  White 86.  Meaningless. G4,R9,D10 or Q2 is far better.]
;B[hp]C[HK:  Black 87.  Good.];W[iq];B[ci]C[HK:  Black 89.    D8 is better than C11.  Don't move near oppornent strength.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[cl];B[fm]C[HK:  Black 93.  F9 is better.  Don't move from a strong group.]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[qk]C[HK:  White 96. J12 is most important point now.]
;B[ih]C[HK:  Black 97.  Good.];W[dj]C[This move is too small, isn't it??
I should try to reduce the center. But how??

HK:  White gave two vital point H4 and J12 to Black with not so good compensation.  White is getting worse.]
;B[hg];W[fh];B[di];W[ek]C[HK:  White 102.  Should E10.];B[fg]
;W[gf];B[if];W[lk]C[HK:  White 106.  Very dangerous move.  It cannot be connected to right,left or bottom side white group.]
;B[ok];W[pj]C[HK:  White 108.  It does good only to opponent.]
;B[oj];W[pl];B[pk]C[HK:  Black 111.  It also does good only to White.  Black should move at O7 instead.]

(;W[il]C[HK:  White 130.  K7 is better. Soft moves are needed where opponent is strong.  See the variation.]

And N18 is better than N19.];B[hr];W[ir];B[gs]
(;W[ka]C[I thought I that the group at the bottom lives. So I was happy to play another move here.

HK:  There is no hope for white now.  If White J1, Black R4.  Black's advantage is obvious.

Let's try a variation with White R4.

AT the end of my review I would like to give you a point.  If you two learn more of shape and tesuji, your Go will be improved a lot.

Danke!
