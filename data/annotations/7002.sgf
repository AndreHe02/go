C[Hi Wawl,

first of all I have to say that you did a good job, if your opponent really was a 10k. 25.5 points isn't that much, so don't worry.

There are some basics you should follow: 
1. Corners, then sides, then center
http://senseis.xmp.net/?CornersThenSidesThenCenter

2. The second line is the line of defeat, the third line is the line of territory, and the fourth line is the line of influence

My comments will be marked with "T:"

Best,
Timm

Hello, this is a game against some anonymous guy, who at that time didn't tell me his strenght (he told me at the end that he was 10k). I am rated 21k? on KGS. (I only started a few weeks ago)

I put some variations I had thought about during the game (I had a physical board next to me to help my reading, although I always try to do it mentally first)

I think most of my mistakes come from a false sense of position and lack of jusekis/fuseki knowledge.

Thanks for reading this :-D !];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do]
LB[co:A]C[I didn't know how to answer to that so I played somewhere else :-/

I thought about playing in A

T: I'm not very good at josekis neither, but of cours you find the most important josekis on the internet, for example here: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Joseki

It's not necessary to study joseki yet, since you should get a feeling for the game, first. Nevertheless I'll show you a joseki for this.]

(;W[ef]C[T: This one seems to high. It is easy for black to gain territory on the left side.]

(;B[jq];W[hq]C[T: I think that one was week, since there are only black stones around. You have to escape to the center, while black wins territory.]
;B[qh]
(;W[ld]C[T: With stones one the fourth line you get influence to the center, on the third line you win territory. At that moment you hadn't had much territory, so a stone on the third line might have been better.]

T: Yes, you're right. There was no chance for black to escape. On the other side, it is sometimes better to be on the safe side. I often lost groups, because I thought they were alive.]
