[qf];B[pf]M[pk]L[qh][qe][nc]C[Rob- I feel that given the presence  of the marked stone, that this should r12 (a), or maybe r15 (b). This contact  play seems to make things a bit too easy for w. Not that you can kill him,  but the marked stone should allow you to press him a bit. Frankly, I think  w's approach is wrong. o17 (c) is much better for w..]

[qf][qe]C[Rob- I think this unpleasant  situation is due to the wrong joseki choice in the UR. I feel a better move  here would be r4 (a). Keeping w separate is not so useful, since r3 (b) gives  w a living group in the lower right, while the marked stones are clearly  alive.]
;W[op]L[qq]M[ql][pk]C[Rob- I don't like  this for w. He is trying to set up an attack on the marked stones, but they  are largely unassailable..I'd prefer to take the corner with r3 (a).]
;B[pp]L[op]M[ql][pk]C[Rob - Normally this is not a good  move in response to p4 (a), but because of the marked stones, it's not bad.]
;W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[pm];B[fq];W[qk]L[cn]C[Rob- I'm not sure I understand this  move...I'd c6 (a).]
;B[pl];W[mm]C[Rob - This is a  solid move for w though.];B[nk];W[mo];B[np]

L[dl][nn]C[Rob- This is  way too slow. I'd either d8 (a) or o6 (b). d8 (a) is kinda risky, but I feel  that if w gets the left side, w is ahead..


 Lazy 16k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[dm]C[Rob- This hurts black.];B[rq]L[nn]C[Rob-I  don't like this at all. You must take advantage of the o6 (a) weakness.]
;W[nh];B[lk];W[km];B[fc];W[hc];B[fe];W[df];B[he];W[kb];B[kc]C[Rob- I  don't like this. m17 (a) is the right move, I think.]
;W[lb];B[ic]L[jb][mc][og]C[This is a problem now. I'd consider k18 (a), and  n17 (b). I think a works. b may provide you with some thickness, and combined  with the push through and cut at p13 (c), you may be able to build some  center territory.]
;W[jb];B[ib];W[oc]C[Rob- A nasty move by w. The threatened cut is severe.]
;B[rd]L[od]C[Rob- I  would prefer the connection at p16 (a). Getting cut there would be a  disaster.]
;W[qb];B[db];W[cc];B[og];W[ph];B[oh]C[Rob- This is good for b, but you must keep an eye  on sente. If w cuts at p16 (a), that is really large.]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[mj];B[oj];W[pi];B[lj]L[pe]C[Rob- Good locally, but lost sente almost has to mean that w will cut  at p16 (a).]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[od]L[pd][qd]M[pd][qd][rd]C[Rob- This is  horrifying.. Not only are the marked stones cut off and probably dead, but  the p14 string is also in dire danger.     mattson 18k*: is entering byo-yomi]

[mk][ne]M[oh][og][of][oe][pf]C[Rob- There is a  problem with the marked p14 stones. If w does n13 (a), then if you n9 (b), he  can kill p14 with o15 (c).]
;W[ci];B[ch];W[bf];B[fh];W[cb];B[eb]L[me]C[Rob- This looks right, but securing the p14 weakness, and closing  that hole to your moyo, are enormous. I'd suggest n15 (a).]
;W[md]C[Rob- Well, this isn't as severe as it could be, but I think this  ends it.]
