C[Xinwen:

Hello I'm your reviewer, and i will do my best to review this game.

This is a very good game played by you in best i believe.];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]TR[dc][dp]C[xinwen:

This is a correct move, and standard approach to opponent's komoku at this fuseki.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd]LB[df:A][cn:B][fq:C]C[Xinwen:

See the variation A B C.]
(;B[dg]LB[df:A]C[Xinwen:

I believe D13 would be better to be at A. Leaving no aji peeking from opponent.]
;W[dj]LB[ec:B][fq:A]TR[dg]C[Xinwen:

I DESPISE this white if he/she really a 5dan.

1)This D10 isn't respecting a weaker player.
2) This move is not standard move to answer yours, more like bullying.
3) Disgrace for a 5dan player if this is a teaching game.

BUT, this is not a wrong move; it is more like telling you that the reality is cruel.

HOWEVER, this D10 has a lot of meaning due to the formation of your D13 stone. As you will often notice strong player omitting D13 and kakari at "A".]

(;B[dd]LB[cc:1][ec:A][fd:B]C[Xinwen:

Very reasonable that D16 would be better at A / B.

Because if White "A", "1" is not a cut.];W[ec];B[ci];W[cj]LB[ec:2]
[dd:1][ci:3][cj:4][cn:A][fq:B]C[Xinwen:

Now you consider the settling is okay?

you made 4 exchanged. did the 4 exchange help you or your opponent?

1 and 2 exchange was bad, and if you erase 1 and 2, it is better that way without the exchange same goes to the 3 and 4.

with 3 and 4, it is very difficult for you to attack at A or B.]
;B[pj]C[Xinwen:

At this point, San ren sei is quite useless. as you're behind.]

Hehe, you're losing.

I think your K4 was actually wanted to "A" and so i would said "B" is slow.

Sometime, you cannot just too obedient to finish up the joseki. when playing with strong player, it is more like Direction and Tolerance.

You have to omit certain move first, to make your shape better. Additionally, 1 is not easy to kill.

;B[do];W[cp];B[dn];W[gi]LB[de:C][cj:B][bp:A]C[Xinwen:

your group is not strong enough, seem to be settled? the answer is negative.

White has only one running group, and you have 2 weak groups.

I think playing invasion at A would be better for you, as you wouldn't help building the B stronger.

moving at A can live and settled];B[ge];W[ip];B[io];W[jq];B[iq]

Hope you do know what's your mistake, i would think that the exchange is wrong.

Sorry i can't review fighting. as i think fighting requires experience and where fuseki + joseki requires study and theory.

In fighting, you must learn your mistake.];B[rd];W[qc];B[pb]

Very good game :-)

I would prefer you to brush up your fuseki and joseki knowledge, as they are the weakest part in your go field.

YES, very correct it is tough for a 9 stones weaker player to win against stronger one in even game. Because often, the stronger one already won the game since fuseki.]

without the exchange, this G9 would look better and more powerful in a way... what do you think?]

(;B[ec]
(;W[ed];B[dd];W[ee];B[df];W[fc]LB[cc:A][cn:2][fq:1]TR[dp]C[Xinwen:

common respond would be like this, then cutting at "A" to get the corner while, white get the outside.

But notice that there's no exchange at 1 and 2, which isn ot so good for black. however, if you later manage to get sente, direct attack at 2 would be okay.]

This is a respectful way to play for both.

For reference, you may refer the professional game by LEE Chang Ho and RIN Kaiho in 1991 ~ 1992 Match. Tong Yang Securities Cup.

In the 2nd Game,  White player (Rin Kaiho) played at A.

In the 4th Game, Rin Kaiho as White played at B]
