C[hi thanks for the review
whites overall weakness? and what needs improvement?
how was the opening of the game ?
middle of the game?
end game?

(magic):
Hi. I've marked my comments with (magic). There are some comments along the way and a summary at the end. I will also try to answer the questions you put in.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[qn];W[nq]C[(magic):
This may be slightly defensive. When you have the two 4-4 points, you will normally try to stay 'high' on that side. (I am not saying this is bad, just pointing it out. I think O4 would be more 'common)]
;B[rp]C[(magic):
Black doesn't need to play this yet, and white doesn't need to answer (especially after the low move earlier). This move is most useful when black needs to make a base. As it is, black will keep more options open if he just plays an extension to Q/R 9 instead.]
;W[qq];B[qk];W[kp]C[(magic):
Black has a nice (although low) shape, white is a little bit more awkward.]
;B[cn];W[ec]C[(magic):
Good];B[gc];W[ee];B[cf];W[gb]C[is this a good move or is there something better?
i forgot what joseki was here or if there was one

(magic):
There are many joseki which you can find online, should you want to. As it is, if you look at the whole board, this move seems dubious. Black will probably respond in a way which will make him strong towards the right side, which will benefit him, since that is where his moyo is developing. White will manage to make small base, but could do that also by sliding to C18. 
Looking at it another way, white is attaching to a weak stone, which is normally not a good idea, since it will be strengthened by it.
If whites original purpose in playing this kakari was to reduce the black moyo at the top (which was a good idea), then he may want to either counterpincer this stone at J17 or even play a kakari to the upper right first.
As it is, white is likely to semi-settle his group, whereas black strengthens his upper right.

Depending on your playing style, I am not too ken on settling too much in the beginning, since I like to see which options are open afterwards.]
;B[hb];W[fb];B[jc];W[cb];B[fq]
(;W[eq]LB[eo:A]C[this a good move?
or would A have been better

(magic):
The proverb says: In a symmetrical position, play on the point of symmetry. Of course, the surrounding board is not symmetrical :-).
'A' would nicely split the two stones, he will probably invade sansan and you could chose which side to build thickness on. (Towards the right, in your case.)
I think that, if you wanted to play this move, indicating that you want to keep the corner, you may want to push on the stronger stone, which is the stone at C6.

The variations give some possibilities.];B[fp];W[dm]C[i wasnt sure about this move i was just experimenting?

could black have done something here?

(magic):
The idea is the same as the one I showed in the variation, but white is too far removed from the other stones here. Black should simply push at D6 and let white sweat it out.

This move follows the rule to avoid contact when attacking, but it can too easily be cut from the other stones. Best play at E6. However, (as I said earlier) I feel that this is the wrong side.]
;B[cm]C[(magic):
This is far too submissive. Black is not defending any territory here (yet) and he can create a weak white group. I am a great believer in 'cut first, think later'. Cutting will leave white with two weak groups and will probably end up giving black the corner.]
;W[dn];B[cl];W[co];B[cq]C[(magic):
Interesting.
The problem is that as white responds, black will end up with one of his outside groups being attacked/weakened.]
;W[dr];B[dq];W[ep];B[bo];W[fr];B[hq]C[(magic):

Black is trying to make a base here, which may be a good idea. But he should extend further. Also, he has room to run into the centre.]
;W[cr];B[bp];W[cp];B[bq];W[dl]LB[gn:A]C[i think black should have played somewhere around A

(magic):
You mean in stead of saving the two stones? You are probably right. The two stones and the territory around the corner are probably worth less than 10 points. The group he can save is worth a lot more. 
Of course, by the same logic, white shouldn't have put them into atari but played at (or around) 'A' himself :-)]
;B[qf];W[pl]C[(magic):
If white wants to build influence, this is too close to the black stones and too far away from his own, Black should cut.]
;B[ql]C[(magic):
Very submissive.];W[pn];B[gn];W[ck]C[i think the push on black was big
what do you think?

(magic):
If you look at the whole board, it sems that white is far behind. Black has most of the top and right edge and a good portion of the left edge, whereas white has a bit in the lower right and a living group in the top left (and probably a living group in the lower left). The places where white should invest some stones are the top right and the left side. This push ends up very well for white, but I think that was helped by black. 

Black can have no hope to develop the lower left group, so he doesn't need to try too hard, but he must make sure that white doesn't gain too much outside influence. I've given a possible way for black to play in the variation which I think would work much better.]

(;B[bk]C[(magic):
This is pointless. Black makes no territory and helps white gain influence.]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[bi]C[(magic):
Normally, this would be an overplay.];B[ci];W[ch];B[di];W[bg]
;B[dg]C[(magic):
I think that just turning at D12 would be better for black. He is allowing himself to be cut too easily. The three white stones should just be swallowed up..]
;W[dh];B[dk];W[eh];B[ei]C[(magic):

Definitely the wrong side to play on. Maybe black doesn't see the danger to his upper left group.]
;W[eg]TR[dl][dm][dn][co][cp][dp][ep][eq][cr][dr][fr]C[black lost the top left with this
but the marked stones are in still not safe yet im feeling
would black have a move here to kill them? or put white at a disadvantage?

(magic):
I think something like the variation will still let him live, but  it is definitely not very good for him.

The marked stones can make at least two eyes (E2 and D1 or D5) and are as such relatively safe. However, they are almost encircled and have little influence. However, since they are safe, they can be used to attack from. An obvious goal could be the black group in the middle bottom.]

(;B[mc];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
(;B[oc]C[i didnt think black had to connect here

(magic):
Sooner or later he does. See variations.];W[re];B[rf];W[rd]
;B[qd];W[rb]C[(magic):
You may want to play through this L&D problem. I don't think white needed to play this move.]
;B[ph]C[(magic):

Better just turn at Q9];W[ig]C[(magic):
The idea here is good. White is trying to make blacks moyo into neutral teritory, and this is one of many moves which will do that trick.

Is this a viable strategy for White? Let's have a look at the position:
Black: Upper 12 + Right 22 + Left 8 + Centre ? =42
White: Upper L. 28 + U. Right 7 + L. Right 18 + Left 2 + Komi .5 + Centre ? =55.5

It seems like White is ahead in territory at the moment. All white needs to do is to make sure that black makes less than 13 points more than white in the centre. 

However, white can be even bolder. Why not play M14?];B[gf]
C[(magic):

I think black is still trying to connect to the upper left group. As a moyo building move, this is not very good. A much more interesting move would have been L13 - putting a bit of pressure on the white stone and trying to build territory.

Globally, I still think that the turn at Q9 is very large.]
;W[gg];B[kr]C[(magic):
This does sort of make a small base for a weak group, but the focus of the game right now should be in the centre.]
;W[jq]C[was whites responds correct?

(magic):
In these circumstances, I think it was fine. White will give black a very small territory and build a wall.]
;B[jr];W[ir]C[(magic):
This is overplay, though. White doesn't need to struggle here.]

(;B[iq];W[hr]
(;B[gr];W[gs];B[gq];W[hs];B[lq]LB[lp:A]TR[lq][jr][kr]C[i think i would have killed the marked stones with A

;W[ek]TR[gn][fp][fq][gq][hq][iq][gr]C[at this point was there any way to save the marked stones? or is there something black could have done prior to save them and save the right group

(magic):
Black can still wriggle. This atari only sets up a snapback for black. The white stones may be vulnerable if black can make white fill his own eye. It could be messy. I have not found any conclusive way in which black could live on the spot or connect out.]
;B[dj]C[(magic):

Much better to play at E10 to set up the snap-back and keep a stone on the outside.]

;W[qj];B[pi];W[qm];B[rm];W[pm];B[rn]LB[nl:A]C[i think A would have been a good move for white
any other suggestions?

(magic):
The largest remaing potential territory on the board is what is left of blacks moyo in the upper right. The white stone at P10 is vital here and should be kept (or sacrificed at a cost). Black can still play at e.g. M13 and cash in a fair amount of points. 'A' may capture the black stone, but that black stone is not as important as the upper right. O, BTW, 'A' does not work (see var)]

(;W[nk];B[ol];W[nl];B[om];W[on];B[nm];W[ll];B[lk];W[ml];B[nj]
;W[mn];B[mk];W[nn]C[(magic):
Why did white force black to capture? It is normally better to leave 'dead' stones on the board - they may become worth more later. And, finally, why use a stone to connect to these stones (saving probably no more than 2 points) when there are still large moves on the board?]
;B[kg]C[at this point i think i was behind because of blacks big moyo
at this time is there something white could have done to gain more pts or reduce blacks?

(magic):
Earlier, white was 13 points ahead. Now, I'd say that the bottom left moyo is larger than black's top right, but blacks just got an extra 10 points by taking the 5 sones. So white should still be around 10 points in the lead.
However, this point has been a key point for some time. 

E.g. White should have played here in stead of at O6.];W[hc]
C[could black been have more aggressive here?

(magic):
Black could have kept more influence and contained white by sacrificng his stone at H18. He should have done so. His lone stone is 2 points - his potential territory is far more.]
;B[ib];W[id];B[jd];W[jf];B[kf];W[je];B[ke];W[ij];B[ji];W[hi]
;B[hd];W[rq]C[could white be cut on the top?
or is white on the bottom a bigger move?

(magic):
I think that there are various ways in which black can take advantage at the top, but nothing disastrous. However, if he just ataris at J15, captures and connects his stones, he has gained almost 20 points and he can set up a ko for his 'dead' top left group and create all sorts of hassle. 

This move does make absolutely sure that the bottom right white group lives and is worth around 10 points. If I were black, I'd probably not answer it, but cash in at the top.]

;W[fc]LB[fe:A]C[if black played A would white be in danger?

(magic):
Yes. The white group has few liberties and the black groups around have more. White can make an eye, but not 2.]

(;B[ie];W[fe];B[hf];W[jh];B[cc]LB[kh:A]C[black had no place to live here ?
white should have played A?

(magic):
I think black could have lived at the top (See variation many moves ago and on this move)
Black living in the corner is worth smething like 30 points. White pushing will lead to capture of 5 stones and 6 points less territory for black - 16 points.]

(;W[bb];B[bc];W[ae]LB[ga:A][ha:A][oa:B][pa:B][ai:C][aj:C][br:D]
[ls:E][ms:E][sq:F][sp:F][kh:G][js:H][qp:I]C[(magic):
Right. Endgame move time. Let's look around: (these are rough numbers - you may want o look at each point in more detail)

A: 2 points gote for either side.
B: 3 points in sente for white, 1 point gote for black
C: 1 point gote for white, 2 points sente for white followed by 1 point gote.
D: 3 points gote for either side.
E: 2 points gote for either side
F: 1 point in gote for white, 3 pointssente for black
G: Very large gote for black, very large sente for white
H: 1/2 point gote for either side
I: 1 Point gote for either side

So, if my endgame theory is up to scratch, the order of play should be (black to play first)
B: G
W: B (keeps sente)
W: D (B2 only, loses sente)
B: F (keeps sente)
B: C (atari and keeps sente)
B: A (loses sente)
W: C (atari and keeps sente)
W: E (loses sente)
B: I
W: D (A3, loses sente)
B: H

(;B[kh]C[(magic):

OK];W[br]C[(magic):

Yup];B[ar]C[(magic):

This move is not worth as much as it seems, since it is gote. Compared to having white play A3 (which would be gote for white), black has 1 more point and white has 2 fewer - 3 points in gote is not large.]
;W[qo];B[ro]LB[sp:F]C[(magic):
This makes a move around F into gote for white. Black can atari and white may have to fill at Q5. Better off playing the edge plays first and then R4, which may keep a point at Q5 as well...]
;W[qp]C[(magic):
It is not necessary to take (nil points !) in gote when there still are snte endgame moves around. (1/2 point in double gote :-)]
;B[hj]C[(magic):

Pointless ko worth 1 point in gote.];W[rl]C[(magic):

You're better off playing proper endgame moves. The ko is worth little.]
;B[rk];W[hi];B[ai];W[bh];B[ah]C[(magic):
Black should leave this until later, as it means he takes gote.]
;W[ag];B[aj];W[hj];B[js]C[(magic):

;W[ls]C[this play i think won me one more point
instead of blocking
is this true?

(magic):
Hmm.
Blocking leaves him a point at L1 and at M7. Your play leaves him without these 2 points but with a captured stone. (I.e. 2-1 in your favour)
However, your line of play is likely to be gote (after your throw-in, the atari menaced by the subsequent block is only worth 1/2 a point), whereas the block would more likely be sente. Sente plays are normally taken as twice the value of gote plays. My endgame theory is not good enough to answer this. Put your question up at http://senseis.xmp.net and see what the experts say.... :-)]

and what is whites weekness?


(magic):
W+7.5
I think both players played a good game. Black got off to a good start and had a good structure in the beginning, but made some bad errors regarding defence/attack and reacted very submissively . The loss of the bottom left group ended the game for black, really.
Black probably clawed back some points in the endgame, but the end result is fair. 

Apart from several places where I feel that more reading would have changed the outcome of some local fights, the isue (for both players) is the global vision. There were several points in the game where the playing was far removed from the major point son the board. Many moves were wasted saving useless stones or pushing for a few points when there were large point elsewhere on the board. 
Try to lean back in your chair, look at the whole board and count, both moyos and existing territory. Often what looks big isn't and vice-versa.

There were no really large fights - both sides were quite submissive. White played quite loosely and could easily have been cut up. (A fact you can see in the end result, where white has 4 groups against black's 2). White should try to to keep his stones better connected. Black should be better at cutting. 

I always recommend anyone to read 'Attack and defense' - it covers a vast stretch of cuttingm fightingm peeping, pushing etc. If you don't know it - pick it up. Apart from that, I have never been a big fan of learning joseki by rote, but I found the 'Whole board thinking in Joseki' series very useful, helping to see what is right in which corner, and play what suits the global position best.

However, there is no substitute for playing. Just make sure you have fun :-))

Best of luck,
