C[Hi Laurent

I will preface all my comments with GC. You have included many variations and so I have left comments and the end of those as well. Be sure to check em out.

Overall, the opening was played well, but the middle game had some places where you can improve upon. Mainly, you need to focus on how much his moyo is worth versus how much yours is. There is also some important direction of play to learn here when doing and dealing with reduction. Please email me if you have more questions.

;W[oj]LB[ph:A][qh:B][pl:C]C[I alway find difficult to answer such moves... what is the better direction ???
(LL)

GC: The general idea when answering these is playing on the side which gives you more territory, which means C. If White plays A or B, you have R18 to make your group alive up top.]
(;B[ph]LB[fk:A][qk:B]

(;B[fi]C[F9 is really loose on his part, but F11 is really slack. I would cut through immediately with D8. This move barely earns you anything.]
;W[hj];B[dl];W[hd];B[ck];W[pl]C[GC: At this stage, because you let white play the H10 stone sort of for free, white's center is starting to look threatening. Reducing it is the right idea, but I don't think you should do it from the bottom right. The center seems to me to be the place. L10 -> right in between. I have 2 reasons for thinking this. First, the gap in his stones is the largest there, and second, more stones there later help the invasion of K16/17. You don't really have any moyo to speak of. Only territory. So your main concern should be reducing his moyo and territory.]
(;B[nn];W[qn];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[mm]C[GC: E7 seems a little slack. I would try to go a little deeper.]
(;B[em];W[fn]C[I feel that white's moyo seems bigger......
(LL)

GC: As I said before, you don't really have a moyo. You really need to reduce white's as much as possible. As for the upcoming invasion, it becomes very tough after it because the invading stones become weak, and so white can attack the stones to make profit in the center. I would still try to play L10.]

(LL)

When you have now more sente moves, get rid of one of your opponent's sente moves. Such as playing T3. That seems to me to be the biggest.

E16 is worth 1 or 2 points. M15 is worth 2. E10 is worth 2. M4 is worth 1, N4 is worth 2. R8 is worth 2 but is sente. T however, is worth a little more because it is reverse sente.]
