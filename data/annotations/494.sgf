;B[pd]C[ wick 17k*: Good luck];W[dp];B[cd]C[ vls 13k*: thanks and you]
;W[pp];B[ed];W[jp]C[ wick 17k*: Where is Ipswich?];B[nq]C[ vls 13k*: About 60 miles north west of London]
;W[lq]LB[oq:a]C[ A2(d4)@0
White would have done better to push form other side at "A"
it's usually best to push toward yourr strength];B[qq];W[pq]
;B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[pn]LB[rm:a][rl:b]C[ wick 17k*: My sister is living in England, but she is northwest of you near the Welsh border. A14(d16)@0
Black should jumpo out to "a" or "b"otherwise w can shut b into the corner.]
;B[cn]C[ vls 13k*: I used to live on that side many years ago
good move by B];W[dn]C[ A4(d5)@0
and good response by W..];B[dm];W[en];B[dj]C[nice simple moves here with about right amount of "space" between moves. Although B is making more potential territiry than W..]
;W[em];B[dl];W[ek];B[qi]C[ vls 13k*: I was wrong I live nort east of London]
;W[qn]C[ A3(d4)@0
Good move by W this will keep B in corner and reduce the right side potential.]
;B[rn];W[dk]C[ A5(d7)@0
w has now let B get right side but B is in trouble on left...
( It's all in the timing and not leaving cutting points around, make more simple solid connections and you won't get in this mess :) )]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[ci];W[de]C[ wick 17k*: OK, I think I remember it now on my Kingmaker board.]
;B[dd];W[bj]C[ A5(d6)@0
W has made some powerful moves into B here. B needed to remove his cutting points before moving on..]
;B[bk];W[bi];B[ch];W[co];B[bn];W[el];B[ei];W[bh];B[bg];W[fi]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[eh]C[thie B grp C8 etc is dead!! Unless W waits too long and b kills the W grp B11.]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[gh];B[ee];W[ej];B[di];W[cg]LB[dg:a][df:b]C[ A7(d9)@0
B can go "a" W can't extend because B can push  to "B"and W is dead.]
;B[eg];W[cf];B[bf];W[be];B[ce];W[af];B[bd];W[ag]C[ A13(d14)@0
good moves by W but B missed chance to kill W on left side now B grp D8 dead!]
;B[gg];W[hh];B[jc];W[id];B[gc];W[ff];B[gf]C[ vls 13k*: is entering byo-yomi]
;W[ic];B[jd];W[je];B[mc];W[gd]C[ A9(d5)@0
W is now working inside B space.. Since B has a stronger position here B should succeed.]
;B[fd];W[fc];B[ec];W[jb];B[kb];W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[kc]C[This is ugly, go back a few moves and see how you could have avoided this clump..]
;W[lc];B[ib];W[lb];B[ja];W[hc];B[fb];W[hb]C[ A9(d10)@0
B let W confuse him here B needs to play outside the w group and then reduce it's potential for making eyes. Protect your own group and attack with same move is the ideal...]
;B[ha];W[ga];B[gb];W[ia];B[cp];W[cq];B[ha];W[ef];B[df];W[ia]
;B[gi];W[fj]C[ A2(d5)@0
W should have taken the KO the loss of one stone was not big..]

C[ A12(d8)@0
B did well to win this KO .. !];B[qd];W[pj];B[cl]LB[bl:a]C[This is not a good move as B still has not got 2 eyes maybe :a: would better!]
;W[bm];B[am];W[al];B[ao]C[ vls 13k*: has entered byo-yomi again]

;B[le];W[me];B[lf];W[ig];B[md];W[lg];B[mf];W[ne];B[nf];W[oe]
;B[pf];W[qc];B[od]C[good plays by B  here and slack by W.. W could easily lose center if B is careful..]
;W[ob];B[nb]C[This should have been good for black may be B played too fast here?]
;W[pa];B[rc];W[rb]C[ A4(d7)@0
This can't work for W and W wasted at least 4 moves, fortunately for W,  B also missed an opportunity..]
;B[rd];W[kg];B[kf];W[jf]LB[nh:a][of:b]C[ A4(d5)@0
B needs to make sure by a move like "A" or "B"];B[na]C[wasted move here by B]
;W[of]LB[ng:a][mb:b]C[ A3(d5)@0
B has only 2 libertys and MUST extend to "A" or attack at " B"]
;B[og];W[ng]C[ A4(d6)@0
B must suffer badly now....];B[oa]LB[qj:a][kk:b]C[This isnot much help  a big move like "a" or a jump to center "b"
might have been good here];W[qh];B[ph];W[pe];B[qe];W[mg]C[ A5(d6)@0
B had this fight without need, W is showing a stronger playing style now.W has almost surrounded a huge center.]
;B[qg];W[oh];B[pg]LB[rh:a]C[B must take at "A" then fight the KO]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[ri];B[rl];W[qr];B[rr]LB[nl:a][ho:b]C[B needs to jump into W center at "a" or "b"]

;W[pl];B[pm];W[om]C[ A2(d4)@0
This sequence makes W stronger...dont make moves that only help the other side..]
;B[rm];W[ad];B[hq]LB[ho:a][jn:b][ip:c]C[this is a big jump and deep in W territory  B would be better to try
"A" then "B"  then "C" or "D" depending on W t response. B must try and live in center to have a game..]

C[ vls 13k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[lm]C[ A4(d6)@0
W mades lot s of bad moves and needed only to protect from cuts to win center..B did well to make space here!]

careless B must be careful at this time of the game, it is very easy to lose points by not looking... every move the other makes means something!]
