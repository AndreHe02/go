C[DanielTom (DT) - Hello memoesk, nice to meet you. I am the reviewer and my comments will start with "DT".
One of my friends on KGS helped me with the review, but he wishes to stay anonymous so his comments will be marked "B.".
"ikami" on KGS also helped me to analyze this game. His remarks will be preceded by "ikami".
I want to thank them both for their time and kindness.
I must, of course, remind you that any mistake in this review is of my own responsibility. With that said, we can start.
Enjoy!];B[qd];W[dc];B[cp];W[pq];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd]
(;B[dg]LB[eq:A]C[DT - This opening is rather unusual.

(;W[ch]LB[ck:A]SQ[de][cf][dg]C["memoesk - i am not sure about C12.."

DT - The idea behind this move is interesting, but it may be risky. Personally, I would make a corner enclosure at R5 instead, and wait to see what Black would do. See variation 1.
B. - I think White should play at A instead, which would reduce the potential of the shimari and would put some pressure on the marked group - see variation 2.
ikami - I am not sure about C12. It looks too close to Black...]
;B[bg]
(;W[bp]LB[dh:A]SQ[bg][ch]C[DT - This move is very bad!
B. - Yes, the timing is wrong. Please see variation 1.
DT - "ikami" said that as White here he would play D10 (which would lead to a similar result to that of the previous variations that we analyzed).
Some pro players (mainly Korean) tried pushing at A, but the fighting is very complicated (I added some variations that you may want to check - see variation 2).]
(;B[bq]LB[co:A]C[DT - I don't like this answer. Black should play at A - see variation 3.

(;B[cj]LB[cm:A]C[DT - This move is very strange. Playing a contact move here looks bad, as it helps White (that is, it makes White stronger). The simple attack at A seems more promising for Black.
B. - Yes, this doesn't look good. Black is making White's weak group stronger.
ikami - I don't think this move is the best way to exploit White's weaknesses. See the variations for better plans.]

;W[di];B[bh];W[bk];B[dh];W[bi];B[cg];W[bj]LB[ef:A]C[DT - White got a nice result here!

ikami - R12 is okay.
B. - R12 is good. White q6 instead would be bad - see variation 1.
DT - You may also want to check what would happen if you tried White A here (see variation 2). "B." thinks that White needs to play at r12 before playing at A - he says that White A is not so important anyway because Black can't take the corner: see variation 3.]
(;B[kq]LB[lq:A]C[DT - This move is strange.
ikami - I don't like it. It is too far away to worry White. Black should play at p16 to finish his shape at the top, which is urgent. White l3 is only big.
DT - Yes, urgent should come before what's big.
ikami - If Black wants to play at the bottom, then he should play more aggressively at A to force White to respond locally.]

[ks]C[DT - Let's now go over the main points covered in this review. Here is the summary of the important lessons that I think you can take from this game:
1st - DO NOT JUST COPY the moves that you see in pro games blindly. Here I am referring particularly to the B4 probe in the opening (see move 14 and the respective variation 1). You need to understand first the reason behind the move before using it in your games. Otherwise you may inadvertently get bad results;
2nd – DO NOT BE TOO HASTY TO EXPLOIT AJI; you lost the game mainly because of your greediness in the middlegame (see move 52, o8). You should have saved the cut for later, or at least prepared the attack first before getting into such a wild fight;
3rd – DO NOT MAKE YOUR OPPONENT STRONGER if you can avoid it. Especially in the middlegame, you played many moves that made your opponent stronger for no good reason. The cuts you played actually helped Black to make his groups more stable - you ruined some good chances of attacking him because of that;
4th - BE CAREFUL when you are attacking. See, for example, move 112 (a17), where you lost a lot of points unnecessarily;
5th - When you reach the deciding point of a game, take your time to find the proper way/direction of attacking your opponent's weak stones. In the game, you didn't come up with a good PLAN OF ATTACK, so you failed in the end. See move 130 (l16) - you should have driven your opponent's weak group toward your wall, and not play from a direction that apparently would give you more territory (and that, in fact, exposed the weaknesses in your shape and so made it harder for you to attack effectively).
I asked my friend "B." what advice could be given to White and he replied: "Be patient". Let's end with that suggestion. :)
This review would not have been possible without the sympathy and help of “B.” and “ikami”. Thank you both very much for everything!
If you have any questions/comments about this review, feel free to email me at "danielfacto@gmail.com".
I hope this review was helpful.
Cheers!])
