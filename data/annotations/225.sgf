(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[I (Okies) have commented on what I was thinking during  the game, hopefully so that errors in my thoughts can be corrected.]

;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[cf];W[fd];B[dj];W[cn];B[bd]L[cc]C[This leaves Black with a strange shape. Normally Black play elsewhere,
perhaps waiting for a chance to invade at 'a'.];W[cc];B[ep]L[ch]C[The  white corner is loose and vulnerable to an invasion, it does not look like a  good idea to force white into solidifying the corner. If White become strong  White can perhaps directly or inderectly aim at invading at 'a'.]
;W[dp];B[eq]C[Black is now heavy.];W[nq]L[eo][er][iq]C[This a nonurgent point. Black can  fix up his bad shape in the left corner. The proverb says: "Hane at the end  of two stones". Another proverb says: "Extend three spaces from two stones".  These proverbs hint that the points 'a', 'b', and 'c' are ve
ry important now. I think the simplest way is to attack with 'c' but White  'a' might be very strong if White now what to do next. If White get to play  both 'a' and 'c' this would be great.]
;B[lq];W[no];B[pn]C[[Okies\] I am never sure what move to make here.  I don't know any joseki  other than just what I see other play.  I decide to counter attack the m3  stone with l4.]
;W[kp]L[ip]C[[Okies\] Here black plays j3.  Doesn't seem right to  me.
[magnus\] Perhaps White can start a wild fight 'a' instead of 18];B[iq]
L[oq]C[Black 19 is good because it is played on the vital point in relation  to two stones at the left. White can now capture a Black stone but this is  not big and Black can force at 'a'. anyway (and probably should do that very  soon.]
;W[kq];B[kr]L[oq][jr]C[This will hurt Black. Instead Black should be  happy with forcing moves at 'a' and 'b'.]
;W[jr];B[ir]L[lr][jq][js][lp][lo][ko]C[Black seems to have changed his mind, Black  may try to fight with the connection at 'a' which is followed by White 'b',  Black 23, White 'c' and Black 'd'. If White then try to block Black with 'e'  Black can cut at 'f' and perhaps get away. Still t
his is very risky and currently there are no reson to start a fight like  this...]
;W[lr]C[... but is also not good to start a fight and then cancel it  immediately.]
;B[jq];W[ks]L[oq]C[Now Black 'a' is not sente anymore and  White is very thick. Black has forced himself into a bad position.]
;B[or];W[pq]C[[Okies\] A miscalculation.  I overlooked that I had to respond to  black p5.
[magnus\] Yes, but it also not urgent to play here. Black just played at Q2  which is not a threat at all. White should play elsewhere even if it was  possible to capture J2! The point is that if Black has a weak corner but  White do not know *exactly* how t
o take advantage of it and Black does not threaten anything, then White  should wait for complications elewhere that might "spill into" this corner.]
;B[oq];W[op];B[oo];W[np];B[qq];W[pe]C[First Black forced White to become  strong, then White forced Black to become strong... I guess that makes it  even. Both players made the classical mistake of unpatiently rush towards an  illusionary defect in the enemy position, face the brutal rea
lity and finally have to retreat painfully.];B[od]L[nd][qg]C[New move! Normally Black  play 'a' if he which to play on the left. Here it look like a pincer at 'b'  would be the strongest move because of Blacks fairly strong position in the  lower right.]
;W[qd]L[qc][qb][pd]C[Perhaps White 'a' has  to be the move here. If Black defends with 'b' White play 36 and has  obviously gained and Black would not be able to get a good result (compared  to the normal similar josekis). But Black would prbably answer 'a' with the  insi
de hane at 36 followed by a White cut at 'c'... the fighting would probably  be completely chaotic but I think Black would have most of the difficulties.]
;B[qc]L[qf][rd]C[Black has very good shape now, and White very bad since Black 'a'  would threaten a link with Black 'b'.]
;W[pi]C[But Black also  missed in the direction of play since White get a chance to erase the Black  dominance of the right side. For the moment it looks even but this move is  perhaps on space too far from the two upper stones. As a whole the entire  board l
ook symmetrical but Black has Sente and can break the symmetri or at least  keep the initiative.]
;B[qk]L[kc][pg][qf]C[This is bad - it just give White a perect  opportunity to strengthen the White group. The area Below 39 is to small as  territory and break the fundamental rule of "Do not play close to thickness".  Black should calmly play 'a' and aim at severly cut
 White in two with 'b' or perhaps later aim at 'c' or something.];W[qj]
;B[rk]L[pk]C[Black should play 'a'. White can  now play here and get perfect shape and thickness in the center.]
;W[rj]C[Hmmm...];B[oe];W[pf]L[qf]C[[Okies\]I felt this move was necessary to protect the  group.   [magnus\] Of course! The Black push at P15 is a "thank you move" since now  Black 'a' is not a big threat anymore. Black has transformed a weak White  group into strength in the center and 10-15 point of territory! You used the  word "feel" instead you shoul
d say "Halleluja! Black pushes me from behind on the 4th line!"...];B[kc]
L[hc]C[Since Black has invested a lot of capital with the push at P15 he has  to play strongly at 'a'. This move is again to close to the Black thickness.]
;W[ic]L[hc]C[This is big since it remove the threat of Black  'a'. White has gained a little both on the upper and right side.]
;B[bc]L[be][ec][cb][ch]C[[Okies\] Seems like a small move for black.
[magnus\] It is not small. In pure territory it is worth about 20 points or  so. When Black play 47 he threaten the peep at 'b' which is backed up with a  possible connection with 'c'. If White had played at 47 the follow up would  be to capture a Black ston
e with 'a' or even better: invading at 'd'. The size of this move is  therefore very difficult to estimate since it gains much both in pure  territory and strategical safety of the nearby groups. Also there are no big  fuseki moves left so it actually normal
 to play a move like this. It is a common mistake to underestimate a move  like this.]
;W[bj];B[ci];W[ck];B[dr]L[eo][er]C[This is also  bigger than it looks, if White plays one of the points at 'a' or 'b' it would  probably be sente.]
;W[cr];B[er];W[do]C[[Okies\]I thought this  was an active way to defend the c3 cut.
[magnus\] I think it is okay - the loss in the corner is just 2-4 points and  this move add strength enough to compensate for that.]
;B[fn];W[cg]C[[okies\]  I think I can separate c11 and c14
[magnus\] I have seen professionals play similar moves, and it is above my  expertice too judge whether it works or not in this position.]
;B[bg]
(;W[dg]C[But this move does not separate Black. Check the variation for a stronger  way of playing.]
;B[ch]L[bh][df][ce]C[Wrong, Black gives White a  chance to play the correct variation again!. Black should play at 'a' then  White could only play 'b' which probably is answered with Black 'c'.]
;W[bh]C[White take his chance to recover from the mistake.];B[bi];W[bf]
;B[ah];W[ce];B[be]L[af][cd][df][dc]C[Wrong! White can play 'a' and Black is separated in two groups. He  can live small in the corner with Black 'b', White 'c' and Black 'd'. But  then White get Sente to attack the other half of the former Black group and  anything could happen. Anyway  if Black play 'a' instead he will connect without any risks - after this move  White can chose between two options.]
;W[af];B[ae]L[cd][dc]C[This move destroy the possibility of playing Black 'a' followed by a  capture with 'b']
;W[df];B[ag];W[cf];B[cb];W[db];B[bb];W[em]L[ei]C[[Okies\]I wasn't sure how to profit from black's very weak b13 group.  I  decided to try to use threats against it to reduce black's territory around  g3.
[magnus\] This is the correct point to attack from this direction, but it has  the drawback of gaining almost nothing in terms of territory or thickness.  Perhaps 'a' is better. It destroy Black eyeshape, it expands White's upper  left center, and forces Bla
ck to flee in a direction which mostly neutral in territory.];B[dk];W[dl]
L[cl]C['a' look like the proper shape.];B[el];W[cl]C[If White had  played here instead of D8...]
;B[fm];W[fl];B[ek];W[gk];B[en];W[dm];B[cj];W[aj];B[ai];W[bk];B[fk];W[gl]
;B[gj];W[ik];B[nn];W[je]L[fh][fi][fj][ei]C[[Okies\]And now I try to  make more territory on the top side and reduce the top right, again based on  threats to the b13 group.
[magnus\] Yes, but what if Black 'a' destroying your center and gaining shape  for a second eye??? White could try 'b' instead. If Black connect with 'c'  White play 'd' and both expand the center AND attack Black severly. If Black  defends White will probab
ly get a chance to play 94 or something afterward *securing* territory, which  would be better than threatening to take it - and then see it vanish when the  opponent defends.]
;B[jb]C[Now White can attack the  Black group.];W[ib];B[hj];W[il]L[im]
C[White can also play 'a' which is  slightly more efficient.];B[fh];W[fg]
;B[gg];W[eh];B[ff];W[eg];B[gh];W[ei];B[fj];W[ih];B[hf];W[ge];B[he];W[hd]
;B[hh];W[ig];B[ij];W[ii]L[jj]C[White just cannot let Black push through with 'a' this is a desperate move  which one play only when killing the group is the only possible way to win.  White normally has to play 'a' and shut Black in even if it means that it  will live.]
;B[jj];W[lh];B[kk];W[jn];B[jo]C[I do not understand this move.];W[ko];B
[io];W[km];B[if];W[jf];B[jg]C[This move cannot do anything for Black  it just help White to defend his shape with the capture of the stone.]
;W[jh]L[kg]C[White can capture Black in a ladder with 'a'.];B[kg]C[Black does  not need to pull out this stone now. Since White did not capture it properly  Black could defend his one eyed group first and then strike at the right  moment.]
;W[lg];B[ln];W[kn];B[jl]C[Meaningless move, it just hurt Black  somewhat below, when White is forced to answer. This stone does not improve  the Black shape.]
;W[in];B[hn];W[hm];B[gm];W[lm]C[Black lost sente because of  the forcing move.]
;B[kf];W[ke];B[lf];W[kh];B[mk];W[pk]C[At last White get to  play the vital point here.]

L[ol][ql]C[White could try 'a' which should  threaten White 'b' now Black has the chance to defend against this.]
;B[mm];W[lo]L[ol][ml]C[White could have played 'a' and see what Black do,  White could follow up with the atari at 'b' and perhaps do something here (ie  cutting of the Black group and kill it)]
;B[nm];W[mj];B[nj];W[mi];B[ni]L[ok]C[Black is greedy - Black 'a' is good enough  (and safer).]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[lj];B[jk];W[hk]C[Black should have played here first (one point  better)]
;B[kl];W[nk];B[ml];W[ol];B[oj];W[ok]L[pj][ql]C[White could play  'a' aiming at 'b', if Black saves his stones with the cut at 174 later.]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[pj];W[ql]C[[Okies\] I foresaw this when playing p8, but now I  discovered that black s8 would give me some serious problems!]
;B[pm]C[[Okies\] Whew!  He didn't play it.  [magnus\] White was very lucky here, instead of loosing everything he take it  all!]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[qm]L[sm]C[White should play elsewhere. If Black  play 182, in sente White can play 'a' in sente so Black will not anything if  White let him play here first.]
;B[qn];W[sk];B[gf]C[This is big.];W[rc]C[This  is also big, it is difficult to say which of these moves were most important.]
;B[rb];W[rd];B[ee]L[cd][ec]C[This is more dangerous than I first thought, Black  threaten both 'a' and 'b'.]
;W[fe];B[ef];W[cd]L[dc]C[I  think that 'a' is the move that work best here since it defends against both  of Black's two threats.]
;B[ie]L[ec][ed][eb][jd][kd]C[This move looses  points since if White coonnect with 'd' Black cannot capture with Black 'e'  in sente anymore.]
;W[jd];B[id];W[hc];B[ed]L[ec]C[The peep at 'a' is  much more severe on White.]
;W[ec];B[cs]L[fc][gd][eb][dc][da][fb][ea][fa][ca]C[Black can now play Black 'a' up  to White 'i'. But it is gote and not very profitable.]
;W[bs]C[[Okies\]  Allowing an ugly KO fight.  I think b2 was enough to win. (?)
[magnus\] Yes it look like White has the grip on things now, if White defend  properly.]
;B[cq];W[ds];B[br];W[bq];B[cs]C[This is a flower viewing ko  for Black since he does not lose anything if White win and take the ko, but  White risk the entire corner.]
