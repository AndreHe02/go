You should ask yourself if your move is necessary and consider playing tenuki.
Before you force an exchange, you should first think about who will gain more.

Another thing you could learn from this game is double ko. Go to move 198 and try to win this ko for black. It's impossible. Once you learned it, it's very easy to see ;-)]
