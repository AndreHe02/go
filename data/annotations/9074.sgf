C[Dear reviewer,

I play white in this game. I end up losing by 10 points in the end and I've been looking over this game, and have not been able to find my critical mistakes or many better alternatives to moves I played. I'd be greatful for any insight you could provide about the opening and any other moves I should consider when the board is still quite open. I personally dislike playing san-ren-sei and I would love any tips on how to improve my play against it.

I've put in a few more specific questions further into the game record.

Thanks in advance,

klin:D6 OK];W[dn];B[fp];W[gp]C[klin: W G4 can consider C3, B E3, W C4.  this is another option.]
;B[fo];W[eq];B[do];W[cr];B[bq]C[I would love a second opinion on the following moves. B3 took me a little by surprise. Was G5 a good follow-up? Is there anything else I could try here?

klin: B3 is a bad move.  G5 playable. Other options include E7, C10 or D9, try to make alive a group in B's territory.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[hn]C[klin: H6 can play at H5.  It is a triangle (bad shape), but avoid B G5 cut.]
;B[ho];W[hq];B[iq];W[gm];B[fn]C[I'm thinking now that B2 might not be necessary to live? Is this the correct judgement? Is it still the right move to play in terms of territory?

klin: B2 is not required to live, but a large move.];W[br];B[fm]
;W[in];B[nq];W[lq]C[I was a little uneasy about this invasion but I felt his extension was a little far, and Q6 or R6 were too slack.

klin: M3 a little bit agressive, but playable.];B[lp];W[kp]
;B[kq];W[mp]C[klin: W H4 can L2 first, see what's B's choice.  If B connects, W then plasy at H4.  With the progress of the game, later L2 may not be a sente.]
;B[lo];W[mq];B[ko]C[Looking back, P3 next seems kind of bad. I was trying to be cute and capture both the side and the corner, but the shape seems so weak. Would O4 be better instead?]
;W[oq]C[klin: P3 at O4 better.];B[mo]C[klin: N5 s thick move.  But coould also play at J8.]

;W[eg];B[cg];W[dl];B[cm];W[dm];B[cn];W[hf];B[hc];W[he]C[klin: W H15 a very bad move.]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[db]C[This was a rather critical reading mistake on my part. I feel B17 would be better than H15. My comments/questions end here.]

;B[mb]C[klin: B N18 too greedy.];W[oc]C[klin: W P17 should R18.  Now, B has G16 and R17 cut.]
;B[mf];W[ld];B[kc];W[pm]C[klin: W Q7 and following moves mealingless, and gote.  W should L16, then L14 attack B's group.]
