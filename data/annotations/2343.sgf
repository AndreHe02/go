C[Thanks in advance for reviewing my game.

Hi, my name is Davide Ferreira and my rating is only 18 kyu, so dont think that my comments exact, i just hope that they can make you a better player. :)

You played a nice game, altough both you and your opponent made several mistakes.

Kokorini: Hi... I'm Fernando Grant.. I will re-review this game. The original review was ok for this game I think.
Anyway I show some more points on it.];B[pd]C[In general, I was unsure
 of myself during the fighting on the left side. Plus I made a couple of downright dumb moves.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]C[Up until now everything is fine, black played at the star points focusing more on playing for influence instead of territory and white made a balancing decision between both, by playing at d4 and d17.

General opening rule:

Play at the corners, they are easier to protect
Then when all corners are taken play for the sides
Then play for the middle.

Remember that if you play at a 4-4 point (D4,Q4,D16,Q16) your opponent can almost always invade at the 3-3 point and make a living group

In the opening you should always try to expand your territory as soon as possible avoiding small moves, remember if you play a good opening your opponent will have a harder time catching up the lost territory.]

(;B[oe]C[This is not a very common move because its a small one and does not really controls territory.

Usual moves at this point are:

Q10
K16
D15

All of these moves are big moves.

My favorite one is indeed Q10 as it the biggest point in the board at the time.]
;W[jc]C[This move is not very good either as white playing on the 3nd line makes too little territory while there are other big spots on the board.

Before playing a piece remember, your opponent best move is almost always your's too.

Kokorini: I think  this move is not so bad, probably on 4th line would be better considering the that corner influence.

Anyway, I think is too soon for this, becouse this may trying to avoid Black to make an extension.]
;B[mc]C[Black is putting too much stones in the top right while more than half of the board is empty.

Proverb: Dont put all your eggs in the same basket.

Kokorini: True, K3 or K4 looks good. even C6 if you want to be more agressive]

(;W[qj]C[The invasion of the corner by white would result in black building influence and an incoming large fight for live, white by playing R10 insured that black does not make a huge moyo.]
;B[pi]C[Dont play that near an enemy stone, R12 would protect your upper territory better.

Kokorini: That's true... but a better move is to play around R7, because this makes territory and use the force on the up-right corner.
Anyway, an invasion on R17 is possible and I think is better to play on the left side of the board.]
;W[qm]C[Necessary extension, but you leave these stones many moves wihout help...]
;B[qo]C[Nice way to block white and make territory];W[cn]C[Nice extension.]

(;B[lp]C[It's a nice extension from Q4

Kokorini: too near I think.. better on K3.
See var.];W[iq];B[kq]C[Whenever you make a play try to figure if there is a better spot... C11 looks bigger than this....

White should at this time play somewhere around D10.];W[cf]
C[its another extension from a stone, ensuring the corner.]
;B[kb]C[looks small again. G4 would be nice. As such white should take the opportunity to play it.]
;W[gc]C[Black could attack your 2 stones at R7 and R10... and make at least some outside influence]
;B[kd]C[Try not to make an empty mouth, your opponent will try to push through it to divide your stones. Always try to maintain your stones together.]
;W[qc]C[That invasion is bound to fail and white got lucky with it.

kokorini: Mmhh... I think White can live anyway (at least a Ko)... see var]

(;B[pc]C[Black should have played R16 and push it against his streght.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]C[Black got the corner.];W[qf];B[pe]
;W[rg];B[rd];W[sf];B[rc]
(;W[of]C[I felt okay about the corner unti this move... I'm sure there's a much better move I could have made, no? This move gets me nowhere, in the long run.

This set of moves were good only because black didnt used his force to attack you.]
;B[qb]C[Wasted move... Q14 is interesting...];W[me]C[White is trying to "attack" but remember that white is still fragile, black could have played N14 or N15

kokorini: about this move, is not good. This kind of moves you make when you are running away with a weak group, probably screaming 'Aaahh!!' or something adequate for the ocasion.
This is because you are playing inside the enemy force, and because that, he is much stronger there.]

(;B[nd]C[kokorini: in my Go club we call this kind of moves:
'chicken play'

see var];W[md];B[ld];W[ne];B[nc];W[lg]C[White got away with some nice influence...

The safest play would always had been Q11 insuring some living space along the side. there is still a weakness at P14.]
;B[lf]C[does not accomplish much... White could have responded with N14...]
;W[le];B[ke];W[kf];B[mf];W[nf];B[mg]C[Black got you here....]
;W[mh];B[ng]C[You are trying a ladder but black has a ladder breaker: Q11.

kokorini: the ladder is for white... the problem is the cut L13, so the ladder is NOT for white for that cut.]
;W[kh];B[pf];W[pg]C[missed that my group was in atari... a mistake that I make too often.

Those stones look lost anyway...

Kokorini: ops!];B[og];W[oh]C[you need to play more solid, and leave less weakness behind...]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[se];W[sd];B[oi];W[nh];B[ni];W[lj]C[Nice you are containing black and making some outwards influence...]
;B[mi];W[lh];B[sh]C[Not the best play for black...];W[ri];B[jf]
;W[ie]C[Yes! you ignored the atari to make another play. Learning when to make that is one of the things of a good player.]
;B[je];W[if];B[jg];W[ih];B[jh];W[ji];B[kg];W[ig];B[kc]C[You got away with a good position again, because black was afraid to risk.]
;W[jb];B[li];W[ki];B[rh];W[qh];B[ja];W[ia];B[ka];W[ib];B[mj]
;W[ml]C[you cant play that away, L9 is safer...

kokorini: I think M9 defends and attacks black group too, so... is better.]
;B[lk];W[kj];B[mk];W[ok];B[ll]C[Black got away.];W[lm]C[Dont cut just because you can...

kokorini: Right.. N7 is better for that.];B[mm];W[nl];B[km]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[nn];B[ln];W[jl]C[Again you got the better half of the cake. :)]
;B[no];W[oo];B[op];W[po];B[pn];W[on];B[om];W[pm];B[ol]C[You could have safely played at R6.]
;W[pl];B[qn];W[rn];B[qp];W[ro];B[rp];W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[rq]
;W[kk]C[You should have immediatly played S7...];B[kl];W[jm]
;B[jn];W[in];B[nk];W[oj]C[I realize now that S7 is much more important here. At what point should I have played it - after black plays S3?]
;B[rm];W[rl];B[sn];W[sl];B[rn];W[qi]C[Not necessary yet, there are bigger points out there like D10 or C10.]
;B[jo];W[io];B[jp];W[ip];B[jq];W[ir];B[jr]C[I also think I spent too many moves building these walls on the J line and not enough (none, in fact) extending from these walls.

kokorini: Yes.. is true.. too many stones in that wall, but You have an incredible influence on the left side!]
;W[hm];B[ik];W[hk]C[Kokorini: Too close. G9 is better if you want.]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[ii];W[jk];B[ij];W[gh];B[il];W[im];B[is];W[hs]
;B[js];W[hr];B[hl];W[gl];B[gk];W[fk];B[hj]C[Black died in this play if only you consolidated your wall... at F7]
;W[gj];B[fl];W[gm];B[ek];W[fj];B[el]C[Black is again trying for territory that dosent belong to him... if unsure of what to do contain first and dont allow for the creation of eyes...]
;W[ck];B[ej];W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[fh];W[dh];B[fg];W[fe];B[gf]
;W[ge];B[hf];W[hh];B[he];W[id]C[Everything fine until now...]
;B[hd];W[jd]C[Wasted move, if black played there you could still connect.]
;B[fm];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[en];W[dn];B[eo];W[ep];B[dm];W[cm]
;B[cl];W[dl]C[This was the mistake... if a group cant make eyes, dont just trow stones inside... B8 would do the job right.]
;B[dk];W[bl];B[cj];W[dl];B[bk];W[em];B[al]C[At this point you should connect and black might still die. Connect at C8.]
;W[dj];B[cl];W[bm];B[fp]C[kokorini: D7!];W[go];B[dm];W[ci];B[bi]
;W[bh];B[ai];W[ah];B[cg];W[am]C[You ignored a stone that divided your stones... always a dangerous situation...]
;B[ch];W[bg]C[bad play. you make an empty triangle and you push black to capture your stones... D13 is a better play.]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[ef];W[df]C[Black can capture at B14.

kokorini: andd... if yu want to defend there is better at D15 for example]
;B[ff];W[ee];B[fi];W[bf];B[hc];W[hb];B[gb];W[gd];B[fb];W[eb]
;B[fc];W[fa]C[This move is not necessary, just contain black and it will die.]
;B[ga];W[ea];B[ic]C[This move is dangerous because it can make your group dead by ko, in doubt play safe at K10.]
;W[hk];B[ec];W[cb];B[dd];W[ed]C[my worst move in the whole game, I think. I'd like to say I was so focused on capturing the F18 group I killed myself.

That's true, D15 looks better.];B[de];W[ce];B[fd];W[cd];B[ha]
