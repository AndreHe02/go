C[First let me say that my comments are those of someone who is only IGS 8-9k (8* on one account, 9* on another - both rank 24) but i'm going to be pretty verbose since it's one thing to play a game, another to analyze it.  The overall problem of players below 9k* usually seems to be failure to seize upon opportunities to attack and what to do with that.  I think this game shows that from both players, but especially black.]

;W[hq]WL[811];B[fo]C[This joseki implies that black is going to attack white's H3 stone]
BL[838];W[dn]WL[800];B[jq]C[very aggressive, usually preceded by sliding under at d2.  implies that black doesn't want to let white settle in corner, leaving open effective plays from left center around C8.]
BL[818];W[gp]C[not as good as simply jumping out to h5??]WL[783]
;B[fp]BL[814];W[ho]C[definitely weak, white should have jumped to h6 at least]
WL[778];B[fm]C[now black is in position to exploit the play at c8 if white doesn't play around there]
BL[806];W[jp]C[??? not clear what white wants to achieve with this-- it allows black to settle k3]
WL[758];B[mq]C[good move !!!  if white simply encloses k2 it will be very inefficient]
BL[774];W[iq]C[white now has 5 very inefficient, heavy stones with no territory and little influence]
WL[748];B[kq]C[black should have ignored this stone and played elsewhere-- c8?? d8** or big point elsewhere on the board.  if white played another stone here to capture k2, black could strenthen at n5-- white's group won't get much on the side and has little center influence]
BL[757];W[kp]WL[736];B[lp]BL[746];W[qj]WL[716];B[jd]C[this is perhaps not as strong as extending from q4 to r8.  since white can now play so as to coordinate with the h-j-k group, but k16 is one of the "theoretical" big points, so . . .
Nevertheless the real action is still in the lower left where black could play d2 and then d8 or c8]
BL[717];W[qf]C[white didn't need to play down here, since if black goes one direction white will still be able to go the other.  eliminating the threats on the left side would have been better IMHO.]
WL[706];B[nd]C[was this move played out of fear of the double hasami??  it doesn't seem to be the most efficient play from the overall perspective of the board.  if white played the double hasami black could use the star point and k16 to create a good position in that sector of the board.]
BL[704];W[rd]WL[701];B[qc]BL[701];W[of]WL[681];B[fc]C[this is bad (imho) since it allows white to strenthen in the direction where black has good opportunities to  pressure white.  clearly this is a territorially driven move but the spaces between the stones on the top, and the "flatness" of the formation don't really allow it to become a significant area of influence extending to the center.  white's stone at p14 is strong, stronger than black's stone at f7, for example.]
BL[685];W[cf]C[thinking small=small thinking.  white should use the  current sequenc e to build a formation for harrassing the black's string of stones on F.]
WL[665];B[fe]C[with this and all of the next ten moves or so, I keep wondering why black doesn't put pressure on the lower left corner and build a position there]
BL[644];W[dj]C[white gets the biggest point!!!!]WL[657];B[dl]
C[this should have been played long ago]BL[627];W[er]WL[643]
;B[fr]BL[599];W[eq]WL[636];B[ql]C[why??? this would have been ok before the situation on the left side and upper left corner developed, but right now it seems that white could really make problems for blacks string of stones in that area.  black needs to take care of that situation.

Positional analysis: WHITE: lower corner-18 points,  upper corner -12 points; lower side 5 points maybe, right upper side 15 points: total 50 points. BLACK: lower right corner and sides -- (at present still vulnerable to 3-3 pt invasion leaving maybe 25 points); upper side: (at present vulnerable to invasion through M16/17 area\] 20 points: total 45 points.  Black is behind now and has a very vulnerable  weak string on the lower left,]
BL[552];W[qq]C[naturally]WL[629];B[pq]C[WRONG DIRECTION!!!!!! Black could build an imposing wall starting from r4 and extending to the group around l-m-n which would work perfectly with the stone at s8.]

;B[nq]C[white has sente and the black territory just isn't big enough to compensate.  white now leads by 15 points at least and still can attack the weak black string.  If black had gone the other direction he would have ended with sente and had a larger territorial framework because the white stone at r10 is weaker than the group around h-j-k]
BL[531];W[oj]C[white should have been aggressive and gone after weak black group]
WL[602];B[ln]C[thinking about territory? this move is probably only worth 5 points and forces white to extend out from the lower white group, which is great for white since it strengthens his group and attacks the weak black stones on F.]
BL[510];W[ko]C[but white plays weakly.  h7  would have been quite strong and also worked well with p10 for a territory reducing move around o7]
WL[578];B[lo]C[ this shows the ineffective heaviness of white l5 but  is really not a good move since the white cut at n6 isn't a major threat to anything]
BL[505];W[ol]C[black will end up with even fewer than 25 points from the territory here]
WL[573];B[kn]C[all of this is quite unimportant-- white can erase all this territory by threatening to cut at q5 with a move at p6.  Of course white needs to defend the cut at j4, but so what?]
BL[477];W[ip]WL[567];B[hm]C[this move should have had some priority earlier on--although it is true that now the white group is looking quite vlunerable]
BL[455];W[jn]WL[512];B[jm]BL[382];W[in]WL[507];B[im]C[now black has some  thickness toward the center but how will it be put to use???  almost any play black makes  to build on it will help white.  black has already lost the game without major mistakes on whites part]
BL[370];W[qk]C[???  why ??? white has powerful moves against black around m16: building up the right side/center territory and reducing black upper side.]
WL[498];B[pl]C[???  all of these plays are so local and fail to see broader strategies.  Black's only chance is to attack white's lower left froup from the area of c8 and then invade  the other side around c12.  This strategy would take advantage of the thickness in the center--it is also the only place where white is really still weak(er)]

;B[nm]BL[308];W[cl]C[WHITE SIEZES THE INITIATIVE: BLACK IS TOTALLY  HELPLESS NOW.  (BARRING MISTAKES OF COURSE)]
WL[463];B[mf]C[A good point --- would have been very strong for white instead of the petty play around q8-p8  but white has strong plays on the left that are just as big or bigger-- the cut at l7 still could give black some headaches]
BL[256];W[ng]C[white should have played somewhere around e13 or f13 -- strengthening his own left-side territory  which is going to get just as big as black's upper side.]
WL[452];B[fg]C[this is where white should be]BL[217];W[eh]WL[445]
;B[ml]C[creeping moves--but does eliminate the l7 cut,  white still can cut this group off from the f strings.]
BL[200];W[mk]WL[432];B[ll]BL[167];W[el]WL[426];B[cc]C[this is big yose but that's all--white should end with sente and then can either play to cut off black stones on the f-line or make a deep penetration into blacks area of influence around k13.]

WL[342];B[ed]BL[38];W[de]C[white isn't even playing the ko since this allows black to fill, at the very least, which only goes to show that white shouldn't have played this way to begin with]
WL[333];B[gf]BL[29];W[he]C[here white is being silly, if black simply fills white will be saddled with running for a connection, and the only good one is on the right, where black can chase him from the lower center thickness and the 13th/14th line above, making territory in both cases.  white would be better off abandoning these stones and coming at the black territory from extensions on the right.]

;W[oe]C[instead of this move, with it's super predictable response that gains white nothing but only strengthens black's position, maybe white should have explored all of the weaknesses in blacks center stones:  there are good, forcing cuts at  h12, m14 in addition to the atari at k9 and the powerful hane at h9.  With all these resources white should be able to at least erase blacks 10-15 center points and perhaps capture some stones and pick up 10 points.  all of this could also lead to cutting off the line of stones on the F line and its extension on line 7.]

;W[lj]C[BAD.  if white plays L11 and black cuts at m10 then white can cut at m14.  If black chooses to captufe the three stones with L13, white can give atari one more time at L14 before capturing the black stone at  n14.  Now black still needs to defend at m16 to save some of the upper side territory.  so white, with sente can attack the stones at h10 and h11 and suddenty black has no center and little side territory.

Still I wonder, who is going to play S17, which is worth about 10 points]

 cigie     Well, my score showed white wins by 23.5 -- basically white had a won game from about move  67.

In summary, black didn't play the lower left corner in the way it should be played when one jumps out from the kakari like that.  The vital point on the left side, and the corresponding attacks from the bottom and side on white's open corner were never undertaken.  If black played that correctly, the game would have made a lot more sense.   But the problem i think all lower kyu players have is judging the value of plays and distinguishing big points and important positions from plays which yield neither territory nor influence.  I have the same problem!!!  But if black played with the spirit of the early move at n3, the whole play would be stronger.

Hope this helps.]WL[581])
