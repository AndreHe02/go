C[Hi, 

I am a local 1 dan in Germany.
So please don't take my advice as the truth.
But I hope I can explain a little

JozefK [8k\]: helo
JozefK [8k\]: enjoy];B[pd]C[Rasmunis [7k\]: Hey, have a nice game :)]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[df]C[Don't really know how to correctly answer this move. Will look it up..]
;W[dh];B[ed];W[de]C[This move doesn't feel right, but I'm having some trouble finding a reasonable move.]
;B[ee];W[cf];B[dc];W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[fc];W[dg]C[That went a lot better than expected, though now my opponent has a nice wall towards his corner stone.

I don't think, that is joseki. It is very big for white. A similar wall comes from the avalanche joseki, but in this variation white is much stronger abd has influence to the bottom.]
;B[cj];W[cl]C[I suspect capping might be better, but I was afraid that would give him a lot of space. This move would also gain me some points, so that's my reasoning here.

I think capping is reasonable. It seems always better to let live small as to try to do something.
But if you are unclear what to do, it is a good moment if a move around there is urgent. 
I don't think so. So you can take a move that is big. An approaching move to one the san-san stones or attacking the lonely stone at the bottom.]
;B[bh]C[This isn't any good as C13 is not a threat.]
(;W[bg]C[Why? If you want to defend there it is easier to take D14. There is a good follow up at G15and the black wall doesn't look strong anymore. 
Instead of this I had tried with D10 or D9.];B[ej];W[fm]C[Some vague attempt to threaten his group while kinda aiming at the lower side.

This is the right idea.];B[el];W[em];B[dl];W[dm];B[cq];W[dq]
C[Good];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[bn];B[co];W[do];B[cp]
C[Ok, so now I have a huge wall but I'm not sure what to do with it. I figured I'd wait until my opponent plays in that area and then use my strength upon him.]
;W[fh]C[So I keep chasing his group.

He missed to play at C9 to give his group strength an eye.
So it is always good to take this point for you first.

Also you have a wall as he has on the upper side the strength can be nearly nullified if approached from far. You could play around L17 and he could play around L4. So playing these points for yourself can't be bad. In fact, if you want him to invade, a good move is at N4 or N3, threatening a big moyo.]
;B[gk];W[hm]C[This works good];B[hi];W[fl]C[I thought I would be able to cut him if he ignored this one.

Not really as he can sacrifice some stones but keep the connection. 
So I think it might be better to play C9. He will possilbly answer with the same move but you had taken away eye space .]

(;B[dj];W[fk]C[Don't do that as it fixes the shape and strenghten black. Do this only if you want to cut.]
;B[fj];W[gj]C[Ok, you wanted the cut. 
But this turns out to be a bad move. In the end you will get one stone but he will place 4 stones to strengthen his group.]
;B[gi];W[hj];B[ij];W[hk];B[fi]C[But that failed. My bottom group looks stronger, but my above group is easer to shut in. Not very happy about this considering that I'm not sure how to use my strong group

He could have exchanged J9 for N8 first getting his group nearly out of trouble.

But nevertheless, you have a good position. At first I want to disalloow the connection of his center group with the top. If this happens, he will have again a strong wall. Consider a black move around G14, If you want to cut the connection, you get yourself cut and you are very weak in the part of the board.
So I would play now F14 or perhaps G14 myself.];W[ff]C[Meant as a peep in order to work my way out more easily.

Good move cutting the connection.];B[ef];W[eg]C[But then I felt I had to answer this one. At least I'm poking out a little.

You could also place a stone at G13 instead. It cannot be cut off.
And pokes out more.];B[fr]C[This a standard move.
It is always hard to decide what to do.

There are 3 main possibities:
a) Denying the connection with E1 or F1.
b) Connecting above with F4 
c) Attacking from the side around H3.

a) Black will answer at K3 and will get an one or 2 eyes at the bottom. You can place some stones from the above or from the right side and you to decide for what use they are.
b) This only an option if yout group by become weak, which i clearly not the point here.
c) H3 (I prefer J3) can be answered with F5 or E1. F5 is very risky as you can cut with E1 now and there he hasn't the possibility to get eyes at the bottom. So it is likely he will play E1 himself. After that an approach move around O4 looks reasonable.]
;W[es];B[iq]C[K3 is also possible.];W[kq];B[io]
(;W[nq]C[If you really want to attack you should play L6. He will]
;B[lp]
(;W[lq]C[Didn't you want to attack his weak stones?
So don't bother with this on stone at O3.

Play L4.];B[jm]C[My wall feels pretty wasted at this point. Feels bad.

His last move should have been on L4 and he has no more trouble, but this is too loose a connection.]
;W[in];B[ik];W[hl]C[You may also ignore this and cut with K5 or K4.]
;B[jn]
(;W[jo]C[This turns out to get wasted.
You can try K4 here.];B[jp]C[Here I realized this was a terrible cutting attempt.]
;W[ko];B[kp];W[nn]C[Meant to aim at either rescuing the two stones or surrounding the corner stone.]
;B[ln];W[qn];B[np]C[This seperated my groups effectively, so yeah, feels bad.

Really? You have free moves at N5 and L7. Why not try N5 here?]

(;W[pq];B[mq];W[mr];B[oq]C[Don't understand this]
(;W[nr]C[And I don't understand your move here.

Just take at N4.];B[or]C[And now my stones are dying..];W[mp]

;B[mq];W[jr];B[ir];W[mp];B[pn];W[pm];B[mq];W[on]C[Too small.

A try could be F15 or J11 but it is very difficult now.];B[mp]
;W[rp];B[jd];W[qf];B[jq]C[Hmm, this group seemed dead to me already..

Yes they were dead before. This is a wasted move.]
(;W[nc]C[Difficult decision.

Perhaps I would attack not so deeply.
Perhaps at O16.
Or expanding your territory with P14.];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qd]C[This might've been stupid. The top will get very big now.

Yes you are right. It is more difficult to reduce the top. Giving black a wall was not advisable.]
;B[og]
(;W[hg];B[jh];W[he];B[hc];W[jf];B[le]C[With the last moves you handed black all the top territroy. Now the game is lost. You have to fight.
At first start with move 117.

Thera are possibilities.
As his center group isn't alive yet and cutting points are at K8 and J11.
The territory at the top was quite open.

I end my commentary here.
The endgame is quite obvious with no heavy blunders.];W[ih]
