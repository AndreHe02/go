C[Mark: This is a good example of how I lose games.  I feel like the beginning favors me (perhaps incorrectly), but I start losing ground from move 50 onward.  I try a lot of invasions that fail and see large moyos that I cannot affect.  I often lose due to one large territory that my opponent builds.

My major requests are as follows:

1) I think I'm doing a good job of fuseki up to move 52, but then white gets a large territory.  What mistakes am I making?

2) How can I better handle invasions or reductions after move 52?

Many thanks for the review.

\\m/ : Hi, I often play on KGS where I'm between 1 and 3k. I spent 80% of the time on the fuseki, you're too passive at this stage of the game. At move 52, w has a really good game because you could'nt take benefit about attacking his weak group. The problem is before move 52.

I hope the following comments could help you for understanding what happened in this game.

(;W[qn];B[nq]LB[nc:B][jd:A]C[Mark: I know that A is a large move, but I've been taught to respond to the 4-4 approach unless something is urgent.  I don't consider the extension to A urgent, so I delay it.

\\m/ : B is larger ;)];W[rp]C[\\m/ : you can delay the answer here and approach the upper right, if w comme to san san, you can still extend to l3 to stabilize so your stones are in no danger]
(;B[qq];W[qj]C[\\m/ : too far, must be on r9 or with r10 alreday in place, it can be on q8]
(;B[jd]C[Mark: And now I make the extension.

\\m/ : In this position, I prefer a 3rd line extension or better, approching q16 stones]
(;W[on];B[jp]LB[no:B][lq:C][rq:A]C[Mark: I believe this is a bad move on my part.  I am concerned about the lower right group becoming surrounded, but I have moves A, B, and C --- all of which secure the group.

The bottom is a large territory, but not as big as the left or the upper right.

\\m/ : Your group is safe because of A but being enclosed by wC bA wN5 could hurt]
;W[qg]C[\\m/ : wrong direction, r10 are strong since p6 and don't need reinforcement, bettre to enclose the corner in the other direction with n17]
(;B[dj]C[\\m/ : I think approaching the corner is better];W[fc]
C[Mark: My response here is "Yeah --- even if I cannot kill this stone, I can force white to live small".  I think that this is good for black.]
(;B[hc]C[Mark: Therefore, I press.

\\m/ : what I don't like in this move is that it makes k16 useless. I explain why : k16 already act as a pincer so h17 is pincering a stone already pincered. It looks like you want to kill this stone, it will ba hard.]
;W[fe];B[mc]C[Mark: I secure the group, so I can use it for attack.]
;W[oc];B[dg]C[Mark: And now I attempt to take profit while attacking the white stones.]

C[\\m/ : looks like a good time for counting the game (rough estimation).

B : 25 UL + 10 U + 12 LR = 47

W : 6,5 K + 35 R + ~10 for the rest = ~50 

So in secured territory you're a little behind, but you have sente so you must use it to take the lead. With its shape, you don't have good move against f15 group so better let it as it stands now. You must make a move with points potential. If you come to d6, w will answer with c5 closing the corner. To prevent the tiger mouth, black D6 and w can invade at m3 with strong position in the corner. With this sequence you secure 10 points and white 12 in the corner so if you want to play on LL corner, directly invading it is better.

Another idea is to limit w expansion on the left with a move like p10, w will protect his weaknesses around q8 and you can use your h14-h12 attacking stones to make a moyo in the center.]
;B[cn]C[Mark: Looking back, I don't like this move.  My group on the left is already secure --- this move doesn't change that.  The white group at F13 has one eye, but I'm not pressing it.  And I'm not doing anything about the right hand side (which is large).

Perhaps H10?  I confess I am not confident of correct thinking in this case.

(;B[hb];W[hd];B[id];W[he];B[jf];W[gf];B[hg];W[md]C[Mark: Okay, this move illustrates my problems well.  I have been building up this wall in the center.  White will live, but I don't see any profit I get from the wall.  In fact, with this move, white gets much more influence and profit.

\\m/ : good move by w, increasing is moyo and rendering your wall useless, the game starts to be very difficult for b. All the positions are strong and w is ahead of about 20 pts]
;B[ld];W[me];B[rq]C[Mark: Again, looking back, not a good move.  I believe I am stengthening the group below to prepare for an invasion on the right.

\\m/ : This is a big move, don't underestimate it.];W[lh]

;B[lm]C[Mark: And this sequence does not turn out well for black.  I made bad shape (empty triangle) and am just putting stones down in hope of getting a good outcome.

I believe I am not following good principles here, but I don't know what the alternatives are.

\\m/ : Nose tesuji is not common, 95% of the time this move will end in a torn keima, worst shape for me ^^]
