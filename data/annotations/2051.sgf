C[Ankh:
Here, I play as Black, and end up winning by only 0.5., though the meaning
of the result is muddled by a few tactical errors on either side. My concern centers mostly on my strategic/global approach to the game., and the matter of invasion and attack, which I have some difficulty with, though I seem to need imprevement in all areas.]

(;B[jp]TR[cj][cn]C[

:: I think it is a good idea here to play high to 'protect' the right side.
Another good idea would be to play low (see variation to this node) to put some pressure on the two wide stones and make territory towards the right by chasing the white group. I think the black stones to the left are a bit too far apart for this to work nicely, though.]
;W[cl]
(;B[bl]C[Ankh:
Bad. I  think that I have seen this work, but the nearby white stones create a problem and this gets messy. How should I have differently treated this?
D12?

:: I don't see what reason would be behind D12.
This sequence doese work. Playing B8 you want to gain influence towards the outside. If you played D8 you would like to gain territory.
If you chose a line you must stick to that, of course. In actual play you leave it. I.e. you switch from gaining influence to gaining territory...]
;W[bk];B[ck];W[bm]
(;B[bj]TR[cn]C[


:: Here you switch to territory - risking to get the lone black stone cut which would make two weak groups.]
;W[al]C[

:: Perhaps instead of taking, white could have played D8 to capture the lone black stone. The black group above is still subject to chase afterwards.]
;B[dl]C[Ankh: Are E5, D12 better? Which one, if so?


:: Neither. Instead of E5, I'd suggest E6. Instead of D12, I'd suggest F10. Why? Those diagonal moves like E5 and D12 give the opponent room to attack by cutting or threatening to.]
;W[cm];B[dm];W[bn];B[co];W[cp];B[bo];W[bp];B[an]C[I misread. It looks like I'd be better off connecting at D5/6, but at this point this invasion seems to have fizzled.]

[ck][dl][dm]C[Is something bigger?


:: Well, perhaps not bigger, but more urgent? ;-)
The stones to the left is quite weak and needs reinforcement. This is what you should think of before making 'big' moves.

Besides, since The white group around here is absolutely alive, G3 does not attack. It's an endgame-move, rather.]
;W[ek];B[fq]C[

:: Well...];W[dk];B[em]C[

:: Here you will have to decide what group you would like to rescue. The one above the white cut or the one below. Otherwise you will have two weak groups on the board which will be subject to chase by white.]

 fail to see a life pattern for this group until MUCH later. Both B and W
tenuki away.


:: A sequence to get this group to living? I am expectant.]
;W[po];B[np];W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[Ankh: This seems overaggressive,
but I find it difficult to be compromising in attack. What follows seems
to be bad for me.];W[pp]

:: I've put two interesting looking lines of play in the variation to this node...]
;W[qn];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[oq]TR[qq][qr]C[Ankh: This
move and W's next two seem to help me enormously. Is there some other reason
why they are played?


:: The two white stones cannot really escape. Most likely white wanted to gain something still...]
;B[pr];W[or];B[qs];W[op]C[


:: ... now white gained some outside influence. But the group is very weak, of course.]
;B[nq]TR[pn]C[


:: 'Play away from thickness'. Playing too close to stones you'd like to capture gives the opponent the chance to capture and rescue his own stones. Better play a bit away.

Also, the cut at Q6 would be interesting to play. White will then have to expand to the left while black takes the right edge.]
;W[no]
(;B[mo]C[

:: Again, close play, that gives white the chance (and live) to capture by cutting!]
;W[mn];B[lo]C[


:: You are protecting territory that is currently not really there since it is open at the bottom.]
;W[on];B[pm];W[pn];B[ll]C[Ankh: I don't know what to do here except to attempt to surround.


:: Well, I don't know what you want to do by surrounding? Seems a bit difficult to kill the group. And M8 is a move with the sole purpose of killing it since it does not do anything else, it appears to me.
So what I would like to point out here is that you should make moves that have several meanings not just one. Most of the times this will be attacking (threatening to kill) and making territory.]
;W[lm];B[km];W[ml];B[lk];W[rl];B[ql];W[rm];B[rk];W[ol];B[om]
TR[ok]C[


:: Since you cannot really kill the group it would be better to make territory. Perhaps with P9.]
;W[nm];B[ln]C[Ankh: Bad. I focus too much on agression];W[pl]
;B[qm]C[Ankh: Obviously something like R9 wolud be far better.]
;W[qk]C[


:: Black's game now actually collapses.];B[rj]C[


:: Now you crawl away with those stones.];W[qj]C[

:: Instead of crawling with you white should have jumped in front of your stones. Like R12. It connects towards the bottom group or gets out into the center while attacking the top corner in the meantime.]
;B[ri];W[qi];B[qh];W[ph];B[pg];W[oh];B[nj]TR[pk]C[


::  The next moves do not really gain anything for both players. Better play somewhere else and don't stick too much to stones played.

Here, e.g., if white wanted to capture Q9 she would still have to invest at least one stone. In the meantime you could, again, play somewhere else.]
;W[oj];B[nk];W[ok];B[nr]C[Gote, but where else to play. To not seems dangerous if I want to build out into the center.



:: Where else to play? The top edge of the board looks huge for white. You could still bentrate from the right side. Pay attention to white's strength on the left.]
;W[ns];B[ms];W[os];B[lr];W[ni]
(;B[mk];W[mm];B[ho]C[

:: Considering the top side of the board this move seems not to be in the direction of play. It does not secure the stones to the left above and does not make territory.]
;W[gn];B[go]C[

:: Plays like this are no good. They force the opponent to connect and gain thickness.  In this concrete situation you force white to put pressure on the black stones above.]
;W[fn];B[gk];W[gm];B[gl]C[I blunder more stones....];W[fl];B[ch]
C[...but in 'compensation' I see a different tesuji...


:: Tesuji? Well, if white stays calm there is nothing to do for black...]
;W[bi];B[af]
(;W[ae]C[

:: Too greedy. B16 or simply B15 would be much better (for the idea).  The white stones below the cutting-points around D13 are secure because of the snapback.]
;B[df];W[eg];B[ce];W[ag];B[be];W[de];B[af];W[bf];B[cf]C[


:: Of course, this is not necessary.];W[ee]C[Mildly
 better, but somehow I've neglected the top all this while, and the shape
of my middel group is poor and seems to not have hope for more territory.
I have to invade again, but first...


:: I tend to not make territory by extending groups that live securely. After a group has some chance to live I play somewhere else threatening the new group to connect to an already established one or living by itself. This is an important idea, I think.]
;B[bc]C[Ankh: unnecessary, I think, but I was nervous.


:: Right. Makes almost no territory and does not make the group more secure.]
;W[cc]C[

:: Just gives white the opportunity to attack and thereby gain strength herself.]
;B[gd];W[bb]
(;B[ac]C[


:: NO! Leave that stone. It won't do white no good to capture it. Even though she then will be able to get some stones out of the black group below.  Play on the stone to the right!]

:: Play somewhere else (or push directly with E14). The stones are connected due to the bamboo-joint. Hopeing for an additional eye or territory does not seem bearing. You won't have to make an eye here, either, since the group is connected to the bottom that lives.
So here the connection of the two groups seems the only interesting point. And they are. So don't add stones!]
