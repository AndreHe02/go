C[booing [2k\]: hi
sinprejic [2k\]: hi :) have a good game

Sinprejic: So I analyzed my own game pretty heavily, and as usual, the main highlight is that I can't read my way out of a soggy paper bag, but perhaps there are other things I missed... also if my analysis is wrong let me know of course.

You played a good game and show good knowledge of the basics, which is very important. The only thing that I see that it seemed you were doing wrong was playing moves based on their local position than on their global position, but your analysis showed that you have very insightul ideas and that you are starting to grasp this.

Thanks for letting me review your game. The analysis you put into it was amazing (though it took a while to go through it all :) ). Anyways, continue review your game like this if you can - your analysis makes me think you'll improve if you continue.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[qn]C[ok so he's afraid of the chinese :) It seemed that the way to punish his fear was by claiming 3 corners.]
;B[qp];W[pj];B[cp];W[ep]
(;B[eq];W[fq];B[dq];W[gp];B[cn];W[kq];B[mq]C[I had mixed feelings about this when I played it. In review I think it is bad... in the game it looked like free points, but really it is aji keshi and "just" points.. w  at o3 is gote, so I should wait.

This isn't aji keshi, but it's not the biggest move on the board yet. It's not aji primarily because white O3 would pretty soon become a big move - it would stabilize her group and limit you to a small corner.]
;W[ko];B[qg]C[I do get 3 decent corners, but w has influence. so I think, I have not taken advantage of r6. not a single pro game in SmartGo or gobase.org matches the first 4 moves, so it's either a brilliant new move that the pro's haven't discovered yet OR.... it's not so brilliant and I should get at least a few points of advantage somewhere :) Right now the game looks even to me. I blame n3 :)

I agree, personally I would prefer white a little since the exchange of 9-14 seems like a global advantage for white and 15-16 also seems a little favorable for white. For 15, simply playing here would probably be better.]
;W[oo];B[fc]LB[jd:A]C[perhaps a would have been better

Yes, I would prefer "A" to this.];W[jd]C[seems reasonable I had hoped he would le me play there to counter his influence.]
;B[db]C[This is not good. Jumping out with E15 or playing a double kakari would be better.]

;B[qc];W[oc];B[qb]C[I get out and keep the corner toonow I feel like I might have a slight edge.]
;W[lc];B[dj]C[yeay a 4th line stone :)

This is big, but perhaps playing P16 first would be better (to prevent white P15 or a shoulder hit)?]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[pg];W[qd];B[rd];W[dk]C[this seemed bad to me. he's touching a weak stone]
;B[ck];W[cl];B[cj];W[dl];B[fj]LB[cf:A][ef:B]C[I couldn't decidi if I should attack with the stone I played, or make a base at A.. both also attack f16 group. I chose f10 because I felt that my central problem in this game was countering w's influence.... I've got almost 4 corners of territorry.

Why not play "B" and spoil White's shape, then play here next for a double threat?]

[dn]C[points wise this is at least even if not slightly better I thought I was quite ahead now but white does a good job of using aji now :(

Actually, I'm pretty sure white got the better part of the trade.

You started out with about 12 pts in the corner, but white erased that and got about 16 pts in sente. Assuming you had captured white's three stones, you would have had about 18 pts, a net loss of 8 pts for you, with gote.]

Yes. I would immediately play at E14 to force white into a bad shape]

Even if it would work, attacking from this side isn't best. SInce white's group on the bottom is clearly alive, you stand little to gain by this. Attacking from the other side (e.g. G9) would attack both the G8 stone and the F16 group.

Plus, I think white would sacrifice his D8 stones.];W[fl]
