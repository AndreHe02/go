C[B: Hi Serge, I'm Bart, around 8k and I'll try to do a review of your game. My comments will start with B:]
;B[pp];W[de];B[pd];W[ep]C[I decided to get influence in black's direction. I think this was the right move here.
B: yes, thats ok.];B[fd]C[B: so I would expect black to attack around C5. But he doesn't.]
;W[ge];B[gd];W[hd];B[he];W[ie];B[hf];W[gf];B[id];W[hc];B[ic]
(;W[hg]C[Ladder, but I noticed that it has a ladder breaker on the next move, too late.
B: yes. K15 would be an alternative to keep influence on the left, but you'll lose influence towards the center.]
;B[if];W[je];B[hb]C[He put me in a ladder, which I didn't expect. What is the best response here?
B: I think your response is almost correct. I'd prefer to make a net instead of continuing the ladder, because black doesn't have to capture (the ladder works for him, remember?).]
(;W[gc];B[fc];W[jf];B[ig];W[ih];B[gb]C[B: black can just continue the ladder. But he doesnt...]
;W[jg];B[hd];W[gh]C[B: ...so you get a the same result as in my variation.]
;B[fg];W[ff];B[fe];W[ef];B[eg];W[dh];B[dg];W[cg];B[df];W[cf]
;B[gg];W[hh];B[ee]C[Can't believe I didn't notice the atari!
B: ouch, that must have hurt.]
(;W[ed];B[dd];W[ce];B[ec]C[B: black doesnt have to respond.]
;W[eh]C[B: so you're lucky to get this move.];B[fh];W[fi];B[cd]
;W[kc];B[jd];W[kd];B[ke];W[le];B[kf];W[kg];B[lf];W[mf];B[lg]
;W[lh];B[jh];W[mg];B[ji];W[jj];B[ii];W[gi];B[ij];W[ik];B[jk]
;W[kj];B[hk];W[il];B[jl];W[hl];B[kk];W[hj];B[ki];W[lj];B[hi]
;W[gj];B[li];W[mi]C[Black seems to be dead here, don't think I need to do anything else with that group. Though later it cost me the game by taking this group when at a glance I thought that was a dame.
B: I'll look at the end game to see if you can get some points there. It's good practice to leave it like this. If you spend another move, black might get another move worth 10 points or more (e.g. Q10).]
;B[bd]
(;W[km]C[Trying to keep those three stones under control, is this the best way to do this?
B: I would prefer to play K7. It takes away a black liberty and even if he escapes, you get a nice wall. See variation.]
(;B[be];W[jm]C[He gave me a free move here, is he being too passive/defensive?
B: yes. He should have played K7 himself.];B[ch]C[How should I respond to this cut? I did badly here.]
(;W[bh]LB[dh:A][fi:B]C[Tried to push his stone away from his ally stones.
B: yes, but you pushed him toward your weak stones. A and B are short on liberties and as you saw in your game, you had to defend there later on.]
;B[ci];W[ei]C[Protecting the cut there.
B: good!];B[bg];W[bi];B[bf];W[bj];B[cj];W[ck];B[ah];W[ai];B[ag]
;W[bk]C[B: see the difference with the variation? You end up a bit lower and the stones are facing toward the side instead of toward your territory.]
;B[dp];W[dj]C[He invades my corner and I protect the center. I think this is important to getting lots of points later and not letting his corner stones connect to the top.
B: It's very hard for him to connect his stones to the top. Better to respond in the corner.]
;B[cg];W[do]C[I begin my wall-in stragtegy again.
B: good.];B[dq];W[eq]C[Is it OK to assume that this shape is the same as "Hane at the head of two stones" even though it was played in a different order?
B: yes. You keep him in the corner.];B[er];W[gq];B[cr];W[cp]
;B[cq]
(;W[co]C[Was this needed? I felt unsafe so I went here? What's better?]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[aq];W[fr];B[as];W[es];B[dr];W[ds];B[cs];W[fs]
C[Gave him life in the corner for outside influence. (Since I already have the area around the center.)
B: very good, but follow it up with a big move to use that influence.]
;B[br]
(;W[an]C[B: see some variations.];B[ap];W[ao];B[mp]C[B: now he plays the big move first.]
;W[mn]C[I feel like this is way too passive. Should I have been more aggressive here?
B: yes, you invested in the left side, so protect that with a move around L4, or attack him at P4, or even go for the corner at R3.]
;B[kq];W[jp];B[kp];W[jq];B[jr];W[ko];B[lo];W[mo];B[no];W[ln]
;B[lp];W[oo];B[op];W[nn];B[np]
(;W[kr]LB[pk:B][fm:A]C[B: right now you've switched your influense towards B. Try to make use of that now and extend there. See some variations.]
;B[lr];W[ir];B[ks];W[js];B[is];W[hs];B[js];W[hq]C[B: here you end in gote again, so black can play the big point again.]
;B[on];W[om];B[po];W[pm];B[pn];W[qn];B[qo];W[qm];B[rn];W[rm]
;B[ro];W[sn];B[so];W[sm];B[rq]C[B: ah, but black lets you have that wall after all.]
(;W[oc]C[What is a better way to invade this corner?
B: R17 is the usual way to invade. But see the other variation as well.]
;B[pc];W[qe]C[B: this is not good. You let him walk through your stones. Better to hane and give away the stone at P17.]
;B[pe];W[oe]C[B: same mistake here.];B[pf];W[pg]C[B: yes, now you stop him.]
;B[qf];W[rg];B[qd];W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[rc];W[sf];B[sd]C[Connect and die... so I cut my losses with the next move.
B: yes, I'd prefer to play R13.]
(;W[sg]C[B: here as well.]
(;B[se]C[B: see variations for the weakness.]
(;W[pb]C[B: same here. P16 is better.];B[od];W[nd];B[nc];W[nb]

C[B: see variation.];W[sl]C[B: this is a 1 point end game move.]
;B[sk];W[jb]C[B: this is a 8 point end game move. Try to play bigger moves first.]

;B[ip];W[iq];B[na];W[ma];B[oa]
(;W[gn]C[B: if you're unsure if black can do something funny, just capture the stones you're worried about. But in this situation, I don't think black can do anything.]
;B[gm];W[fm];B[go];W[gl];B[ja]C[B: and now he's first to play a big end game move.]
;W[ib];B[jc]
(;W[kb]C[B: J19 is possible I think. Its worth 1 point more.]
;B[ia];W[ka];B[ha];W[kh]C[Thought it was a dame! This costs me the game!
B: I hope I pointed you some other places where you could have gotten some points. But I know it feels that way if you look at it.]
;B[di];W[ek]C[Needed?
B: no, so this is also a -1 point move (a stone in your own territory).]
;B[gp]
(;W[hp]C[Are there better options here to get more points other than capturing here?
B: unless you played the chinese rules, this is a -1 point move as well.]

[os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[He got all four corners and I got the center. This is how my games tend to end up because I always play to trap my opponent into the corner. I need to be more balanced somehow. And good tips for taking the corners? For example my failed invasion on the top right led me to simply trap him into the corner instead of getting the corner.
B: it's not bad to let your opponent get a corner. If you get outside influence and can use that to make more point, you win :-) Invading the corner is usually done by starting at the 3-3 point, as I've shown. Hope you found my review helpful. I think overall you played a good game. Try to look at the bigger picture. Maybe a little less fighting (untill you're stronger) and more playing on territory and influence, because it seems your intuition on that is good. It only needs a little finetuning. Good luck!]
