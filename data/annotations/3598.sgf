AB[dp][pd]C[Hello, my name is Tom. I'm about 10 kyu AGA. I'll be reviewing for white, but will comment on black at times as well. My remarks will be preceded by TJO>>>.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[cn];B[do]C[TJO>>> Strange move for b. he has not strengthened his corner with d5.]

(;W[bp]TR[fq]C[TJO>>> the slide to B4 is okay, but it gives b the chance to fix his mistake. Better, I think to make him pay immeadiately by playing near F3.]
;B[cq];W[fq]TR[hq][hp][ip]C[TJO>>> So white plays F3 now, but w has given black an opportuinity to pincer  the F3 stone . A b play now at one of the marked locations would be difficult for w. (See vaiation for the B4 move)]
;B[eq]C[TJO>>> b is fearful and plays defensively. This is a mistake. Black should attack white and keep him weak.]
;W[hp]C[TJO>>> A little slow. As shown in the variation J4 is preferrable, but now with a stone at E3 the narrower extension is appropriate, but not as good for white overall.]
;B[jp];W[jq]TR[gn][lq]C[TJO>>> playing contact will strengthen b. contact play should be reserved primarily for defense. The problem here is that white does not have enough of a base with the two white stones to be out of danger. I would have opted for something near G6. This would set w up for an invasion later at the botom near M3.]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[fp];W[gq];B[fr];W[gr];B[fs];W[gs];B[kq];W[er]
;B[dr];W[es];B[ds];W[kr];B[lr];W[lq];B[kp];W[js]C[TJO>>> Not needed. With the two stones taken at F1 and F2, the group is alive. Better to take sente and make a big move elsewhere.]
;B[lp];W[mq];B[mr];W[dk];B[dm];W[dn];B[nq];W[ls]C[TJO>>> ??? Wasted move! You must use these moves at this point in the game to plant your flag in other parts of the board!]
;B[mp]C[TJO>>> Fortunately, b returned the favor :-) He did not need to take these stones yet.]
;W[fn];B[ms];W[ks]C[TJO>>> Antoher opprtunity to make b pay. If her takes the M1 stone it is of very little value. There are 20 and 30 point moves ont eh board right now. That must be the priority.]
;B[en];W[em];B[eo];W[go];B[fm];W[el];B[cm];W[bm];B[gn];W[fo]
C[TJO>>>  Yes very tempting to connect and it is easy to get pulled in on these. But, there is a capturing race that you have forgotten about. Better to sacrifice this one stone and save the stones to the left.]
;B[ho];W[gp];B[is];W[jr];B[bn];W[co];B[bo];W[cp];B[ap];W[ep]
;B[bq];W[dq];B[ir];W[hq];B[eq];W[gm];B[fl];W[dq]TR[gn]C[TJO>>> It is good to learn to fight ko, but it is pointless now. There are no groups hanging in the balance. Better for w to have taken the marked stone and broken out into the middle!]
;B[hn];W[fk];B[gl];W[hm];B[hl];W[im];B[in];W[eq];B[jm]C[TJO>>> Again, the ko was a temptation. The three stones in teh center are of much more value!]
;W[cr];B[il];W[dg];B[jd]TR[il][jm][in][hl][jp][kp][lp][mp][nq]
[pp]C[TJO>>> At this point the game is over. The only hope for white is that an inexperienced b opponent will make a few blunders to let w back into the game. Even the open right side is not a great target with all of the power built up in the center (marked stones.)]
;W[gc];B[pj]C[TJO>>> Letting black have this point made a bad situation unbearable. THe play at G17 gained only a few points, espeically when you consider that the corner is still invadable.]
;W[jc];B[kd]TR[kc]C[TJO>>> hane is beter here!];W[kc];B[nc]
;W[mc];B[mb]TR[md]C[TJO>>> better for b to play hane on top to keep w penned in.]
;W[lc]LB[lb:A][qf:B]C[I wonder if this move would have been better made at M18 (a), or would it have been foolish to quibble over 2 or 3 points this early in the game?  Would a bigger move been to play altogether somewhere else?  Perhaps R14 (b)?]
;B[lb];W[kb];B[ka];W[ja];B[la];W[id]TR[nb][me]C[TJO>>> You must watch carefully for blunders. Not only did black give you a chance to move into his territory with a move at N15, he also gave you 4 stones.]
;B[na]
(;W[ne]LB[md:A]C[I think N16 (a) would have been a better move to reach out here. Instead, O15 is cut off in the next move.

TJO>>> N15 is correct. It cannot be cut. (See variation.)];B[md]
;W[ld]LB[nd:A]C[Should I have supported O15 at O16 (a) here instead?]
;B[ia]C[I need to learn to keep this kind of thing from happening to me.  I've been losing games on the first line lately.]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[ha];B[le];W[ja]C[A recovery from move 102, but at what cost?]
;B[ie];W[me]C[Looking at this now, I see no reason to have played the atari at N15.  Likely a feeble attempt at taking sente.]
;B[nd];W[oe];B[pe];W[pg]C[A late and ill fated attempt to advance down the right side.]
;B[of];W[pf];B[mf];W[nf];B[og];W[ng];B[oh];W[ph]C[Better played at O12.]
;B[nh];W[mg];B[lg];W[lf];B[ke];W[kf];B[je];W[jf];B[hd];W[ic]
;B[if]
(;W[kg]LB[jg:A]C[Too many pointless ataris.  I wonder if this stone played at K13 (a) would have been better.  Reach toward the left side.

TJO>>> Black's marked group is in trouble. How about playing at K12 and the an eventual play at M12 trapping bllack in a net (geta). Then pursue the black group and force it into your waiting stones at the left? (See variation)]
;B[lh];W[mh];B[mi];W[ni];B[oi]
(;W[nj]TR[li]C[TJO>>> What about M11, double atari? (See variation)]
;B[od];W[li]C[TJO>>> Ouch! Too late!];B[mf];W[kh];B[mj];W[ji]
;B[hh];W[hg];B[gg];W[fe]
(;B[hf]C[TJO>>> Better for b to trap the white stone with a play at J13. (See Variation)]
;W[fh];B[gj];W[fj];B[ig]C[TJO>>> Ahhh the difference one move can make. the double atari one move late cost w a lot.]
;W[ih];B[lj];W[kj];B[ki];W[hi];B[gi];W[li];B[hj];W[ij];B[ii]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[hi]C[All these stones in the center, and no eye space.]
;B[ki];W[ii]C[If I were to fill a Ko, the one on the right would have been better.]
;B[kk]TR[jh]C[TJO>>> There are no eyes here! The marked intersection is a false eye.]
;W[lk];B[jj]
(;W[qn]LB[qj:A]SQ[pf][pg][ph]C[I think I should have played this stone at R10 (a) instead.  All this stone seems to have done is drive black upward into the marked group.

TJO>>> Perhaps, butr10 is not a good way to create life for the marked stones. (See variation)]

TJO>>> This is fine as it is a peep. b must respond or lose the H16 stone.]
;B[he];W[fg];B[hc];W[hb];B[gd];W[fd];B[jh];W[gf]LB[fb:A]C[This move seems wasted.  I think I should have played at F18 (a) to prevent black cutting.

TJO>>> But if b cuts what can he do. The group the the right has life and b will be hard pressed to live.]

C[signal9 [23k?\]: hehe, nice game

TJO>>> I would not say fighting too much was your problem in this game. Rather it was not considering carefully your priorities. Early on you failed to get stones into black's base (moyo) that would have kept him from sealing up so much territory.

Also, you missed a few moves in life a death situations. This is normal for players of your strength. However, spending 15-30 minutes a day doing life and death problems (tsumego), even the same ones over and over again, will help your game immensly.

Focus on these points for now and keep playing. THat is really important. It is good that you ask for reviews. I have been a bit blunt in my comments, but not out of disrespect for you or your style of play. Your errors are ones I made not so long ago. :-) Keep enjoying the game!

Good luck!
