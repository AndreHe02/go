C[Hello,  My name is Ray and I live in  Tucson, AZ.  I don't know
my official  rating, but am somewhere between a  15 and a 12K.
This game is an  anathema to me.  I started out with  what I
thought was excellent control,  and ended up being devaistated.
I was  hoping that you could give me some  advice as to how it
could have been  better played.  Thanks.

RM: This game illustrates some of the problems with making one
large central moyo. They are easily invaded (and conversly hard
to defend). Whilst defending a central moyo it gives the opponent
an excellent chance to make large efficient areas around the
edge. Also these moyos look much larger than they are.

;B[do]C[RM: The opening looks good for black];W[cn];B[dr]C[RM: This is too small. Consider one of the following: R4 (keeps
the
corner). R14 (strengthens Q10, enlarges your area and attacks
R16). P16 or P17. D6 followed by K4.];W[cr];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds]
;W[br];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[dj]C[RM: Attacking a strong group is almost always a mistake! It is
worth noting that as white is alive he can cut at D6 later.
Your D7 group would then be chased into the center, giving white
plenty of chance to strengthen himself and take control of the
game. Currently you can ladder his cutting piece (e7), but building
a large house on faulty foundations is dangerous.];B[cl];W[bl]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[bk];W[bm];B[al]C[RM: White's group is connected and alive. So this move is not
threatening
and not sente. Black's tall group has a lot of potential but
can be invaded or cut. D6 would turn it from a weak foundation
to a useful springboard.];W[qp];B[po];W[pq];B[oq];W[pr];B[or]
;W[qo];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm]C[RM: Black is putting all his eggs in one basket. White's move
here
is not sente. P16 would threaten whites corner stone and allow
black to live at the top, destroying whites structure. Black's
top group would then work well with his group below.];B[rl]
;W[kd];B[an]C[RM: White's group is alive. Attacking it can only cause black
to
finish in gote. Also this area may be worth a lot to black as
ko threats later in the game.];W[am];B[ao];W[ap];B[aq];W[bn]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[ao];W[bp];B[ak]C[RM: Although black appears to have finished in gote he need not
have.
Saving the one stone can only be regarded as an endgame move
(which should be at A13 or A11 not A9 anyway). A9 =3D 2 points.
A13 =3D 8 points (in sente). Playing at C17 would take away at
least 10 points from whites corner. Playing at G9 would strengthen
black's large moyo
and white would be forced to defendat F11, G11 or similar (to
avoid loosing at lot of terratory).];W[bj];B[ej];W[cg];B[ei]
;W[qh];B[oh]C[RM: Yes];W[ph]C[RM: I think white should have cut black at D6]
;B[og]C[Ray: up to here, I was fairly confident.  I had  good corner
control
in both lower  corners, and felt strong in my lead

RM: The center always looks bigger than it is. At this point
in the game white looks strong, with a lot of terratory. Blacks
large moyo is flawed on the left hand side.

Imagine the area white has in the bottom corners. Subract that
from blacks large moyo. Now compare black's terratory versus
white's. Looks similar? Now notice the weak points D6 and D3.
If white breaks into black only group just a little ...]
(;W[pf]C[RM: If instead white cuts at D6 ...];B[jp];W[kf];B[kh]
;W[jh];B[ji];W[lh];B[jg]C[RM: Should be at M11. E11 already erases much of whites terratory,
so this dangerous move is not worth the risk. M11 helps to link
up with blacks right hand side.];W[ih];B[ii];W[kg];B[ki];W[li]

(;B[lj];W[mj]
(;B[mk]C[Ray: Here, I was not thinking.  Trying to  prevent white from
pushing
me all the  way into the lower right corner,  I made a silly
move and overextended  myself instead.  I have some difficulty
recovering well from situations such  as these.  What could I
have done  instead?

RM: Playing straight down (M9) would start a liberty race, but
this is complicated. Forcing play with a throw in at N11 look
like a simpler way to keep what's yours. But suffers from a ko
battle which is bad for black. Clamping at O10 makes a strong
shape with P12/13/Q10. It threatens to cut white and seems to
work :-)];W[lk];B[kj];W[nk];B[ml];W[ni]

(;B[pp]C[Ray: Here I ended up with the same problem  I earlier sought
to avoid.
He can now  bring his stones to bear on my corner  group from
two directions.

Was there a better way to handle this  from here?

Perhaps I should have given up the  corner in order to maintain
the center  moyo?

RM: No need for white to connect immediately. Playing o5 first
forces white to defend ...];W[no];B[np];W[mo];B[mn]C[RM: Should be M7.]
;W[ln];B[mm];W[ll];B[lp];W[lo];B[km];W[lm];B[oi];W[oj];B[ok]
C[RM: Even if black takes p10 it is a ko. Since the ko is no trouble
to white if he looses it, black should not play for it. Just
connect at p11 instead.];W[pk];B[pl];W[ol];B[qk];W[pi];B[ok]
;W[nj];B[pk];W[hi];B[hh];W[ig];B[hj];W[gi];B[gh]C[Ray: Here, I think that I should have  ensured that I held the
low
center (by  playing at A) before trying to prevent  whites expansion
at the top.  The only  problem I see with that is that once I
play at A, I will be shut off from the top,  preventing a serious
invasion, I think.
RM: Looks like white is ahead, so you were correct to take the
risk.];W[gj]

Black's triangle N8 can capture either white stone next to it,

Q8 etc.
