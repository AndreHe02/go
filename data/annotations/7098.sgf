Dear reviewer,
I played white in this game, and i think that i lost the game because i lost an invading group.
Please help me to find out my mistakes.
Thomas

J: Hello. I'm Juuso Nyyss√∂nen, your reviewer. I have marked all my comments with J:

There's a short overview at the end of the game.

Let me know if you have any questions!];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp]

J: Yes, up to here I would also prefer white. :)];B[cl]LB[en:A]
[cp:B]C[i don't really know how to deal with this move, so i chose what i tought to be the best.

J: I think your move was good. Other alternatives would be jumping at A and starting the running fight, but I'm not sure if the fight is very good for you. You could also settle your stone with B in the corner, but black will get some strength outside. That would hurt your moyo.

Look at A and B for some variations.]
(;W[ei];B[dm];W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[bn];W[er];B[dq]
;W[dr]C[i feel good now, black is overconcentrated and my moyo looks nice.

J: Yes, black is horribly overconcentrated here. The result obviously favors white.]
;B[de];W[fd];B[fe];W[ge];B[ff]
(;W[gd]LB[ed:A]C[J: I think you should play the peep at A instead of this move to gain the initiative in this fight. Look at the variation.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[gg];W[gi]C[J: Anyway, this result is still pretty good for you.]
;B[ig];W[ii];B[jh]
(;W[ne]LB[ji:A]C[J: I would still protect the group with A. Letting black push at A makes his right side more valuable. See the variation.]
;B[kj];W[cg];B[dh];W[di];B[ch];W[bh];B[bg]
(;W[bj]C[J: You can capture the stone with A instead of this. See the variation.]
;B[bf]C[J: Now the eyeshape of your group is worse compared to the variation.]
;W[eg];B[dg]
(;W[eh]C[J: Playing A first is a bit better.];B[df];W[fk];B[jc]
C[is there a better way to deal with this move ?

J: I think your move is fine. It seems like the strongest resistance.]
;W[kd];B[md];W[nd];B[ld]
(;W[kc]LB[le:A]C[J: I think you can cover at A immediately. :)]
;B[lb];W[kb];B[mb];W[pc]C[J: Cool move.];B[qc];W[le]C[J: This result is not bad for you, but you could have got more. :)]
;B[lq];W[rq];B[mo]
(;W[fr]LB[eq:A]C[J: I would personally like to cut at A here. See the variation.]
;B[gp];W[hk];B[ob];W[nb];B[na];W[mc];B[og]C[Is there a better way to enter in black's area ?

J: Do you really need to enter so deeply? I think you have enough territory to reduce more lightly. Invading so deep just seems very dangerous.]

(;W[qj];B[qi]C[J: Your prospects here seem very dim.];W[pi]
LB[pk:A]C[J: Black could probably extend at Q9 now and you would have gained nothing.]

(;W[qk]C[Now i think would have been better at 1

J: I don't think you can get a very good result regardless.]
;B[om];W[ol];B[lm];W[qm]C[useless

J:I don't think there was any way to live now anyway.];B[rj]
;W[kl];B[ll]C[J: Your invasion completely solidified black's right side. The right side also grew because of your invasion. I think we can conclude that the invasion was not a very good idea.]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[gq];B[fp];W[hq];B[ro]C[now it's obvious i'm behind]
;W[pb]C[was it too soon ?
It looks huge to me.

J: It is very big. You are behind, so you have to make a mad grab for the points anyway. :)]
;B[qb];W[pa];B[od];W[oc];B[mf];W[me];B[gl];W[gk];B[hm]C[J: I think the game is essentially lost for white now. Black just has way too much territory.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[hl];B[gm];W[bm];B[bl];W[dk]C[Maybe this move is overly defensive, i'm behind so i must try to play something else, isn't it?

J: The move seems unnecessary, yes. I don't see any good moves for white to catch up with, though. :(]

i resigned here

J: You played well in the opening and were leading by territory at the end of it. Your problem in the game was not how you handled the right side group, the problem was that you made the group in the first place. You should try to count the points to see whether you need to invade or if a light reduction is enough. In this case a reduction would have been enough since you had a lead.

Have you read the book Attack and Defence by Akira and Davies? If you haven't, I would highly recommend reading it. Even if you have read it, I think you should re-read it. It has a lot of nice stuff about judging the balance of territory and power and picking your strategies accordingly.

I hope the review was useful. Keep on playing!

[es][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[J: We can compare the territories now. I have marked all the points I think are solid. With the komi, white is obviously leading on solid points. However, black still has some potential to make some points on the bottom and in the center. The game will depend on how you handle those areas. Also, playing a good endgame will be very important. However, I think your chance of winning is significantly higher than when you invade on the right side. :)]
