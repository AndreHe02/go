(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[Comments for the teaching  ladder by Erik Ekholm  (EE), made on the request by Neil Mitchison (NM), who played White in this  game.

To summarize: You have good fighting spirit and courage, but you sometimes  attack too hard and end  up with too many weaknesses (bad aji). I think you would benefit from  attacking with better shape and  save the all-out attacks for emergencies. An other thing I noticed is that  you have a tendency to push  your opponent's groups against your own weak stones. That should be avoided.]

 Niall 8k*: #bow#];W[qp]C[
 Niall 8k*: BTW I like your e-mail address... :-)];B[dd];W[do]C[EE: I've also experimented with this formation recently. :-)]
;B[dq];W[fp];B[fr]C[EE: Too low  to play so early in the game. Now White should play the contact move at  san-san (see variation) to force  Black down further and take advantage of Black's slack play.]

(;W[cp];B[cq];W[dj]L[eo]C[EE: Compared  with the variation, Black is stronger with more profit in the corner and  White is weaker. The aji of a Black  play at 'a' is more of a liability now. Since White's position can't exactly  be labelled thickness, maybe the  extension should be a line or so narrower.]
;B[ch];W[cf]L[ei][gq][oq][jc][pj][qf]C[EE: This is an aggressive  choice of play. A few calmer alternatives are 'a' (to emphasize the center to  be consequent with the 5-4  strategy), 'b' (press down on Black and strengthen White's outside) or the  normal fuseki points of  'c'-'f'.]
;B[eh];W[ef];B[fd];W[bd]C[EE: When playing this, one should have a  clear awareness that one is  giving up the flexibility that the possibility of a later invasion at san-san  gives.]
;B[cc]
(;W[dg]L[df]M[dj]C[EE: This is vulgar style. It  strengthens Black and therefore weakens the  marked stone. White's shape is also pretty bad after the exchange. White  should not feel uneasy about the cutting point at 'a', since he has many
ways to handle the situation if Black should cut.

NM again: What would you recommend as a
"way to handle the situation"?  I didn't see any
result that I would regard as good, though
some (e.g. D13, D12) would not be disastrous.

EE: Good question. Okay, let's assume that White doesn't play D13 but instead  jumps (var. B) and that Black tries to cut.]
;B[dh];W[gf];B[hd]
(;W[fh]M[dg][dh]L[fj][gh][fg]C[EE:  Pricipally, this move is bad, though tactically it might work. It is very  complicated to read out what  happens. I'm quite lost. :-)

"Don't touch what you are attacking" is a fundamental principle of Go. White  should  attack the three  black stones from a distant, to compensate himself for giving Black territory  at the top and bottom. A  normal attacking move here would be 'a' (or 'b' if the marked exchange hadn't  taken place; because of it,  'c' works well for Black). 'a'  would give White the beginning of a moyo in  the bottom left quarter of the  board.

The played move, being a contact move, is therefore dubious as an attacking  move. The marked  exchange has given Black's group many liberties, so tactically it is strong,  therefore #22 has the feeling  of banging your head against a wall.

NM again: without the marked exchange, what would you recommend white do  after white 'b',
black 'c'?  Push through at D12?

EE: See diagram.];B[ej]L[fi]C[EE: The hane at 'a' might work, but it  gets hairy if White  cuts.]
;W[fi];B[dk]M[dj]C[EE: White's two last moves have pressed Black  towards the single White stone, weakening it considerably. Its weakness helps  Black to  develop.]
;W[cj];B[ei];W[ck];B[dl];W[cm]L[cl][eo][fg]C[EE: White's  position just barely holds together,  there is bad aji everywhere: 'a', 'b' and 'c'. White has been pressing too  hard, his surrounding positions  weren't strong enough to justify that. White should try to attack in good  shape and see more to the side  effects of his attack.]
;B[gk];W[ii];B[ik];W[bg]L[fn][fl]C[EE: This feels small. I recommend  'a' to fix up White's shape. Later,  White has the eye-stealing peep at 'b' to play, if he wants to continue the  attack on the black group.]

;B[bp]
(;W[co]L[dp][eo]C[NM: I think I should have played B3 to keep  sente...

EE: Do you mean B5? B3 doesn't seem to work, i.e. maintain connection (see  variation). B5 is sente only  if Black answers which isn't likely. B5 also leaves Black with an atari at  'a', which makes a Black cut at 'b'  more effective. So, I think White did play the right move here.

Black seems to be leading here: White has about 12 points on the left which  about equals Black's bottom and center put together. TR and BR
corners cancel. But Black's top is more than komi and he has sente too.
His group in the middle is pretty safe now.

NM again: see further variation - I don't see what
defense B would have had? (Alas, I didn't see it
during the game :-( )];B[gq];W[gp];B[iq];W[ip]L[pj][ep][fn][fm]
C[NM:  Should I just have ignored J3?

EE: A black block here is big, but all groups around here are pretty stable,  and there's still the first class  extension at 'a' left, so in your place I would tenuki.

There is a potential cut at 'b' left behind. As White, I would feel safer if  I exchanged 'c' for 'd' to secure the  connection.]
;B[jq];W[kp]L[jp]C[EE: Dubious, Black can push and cut  through the gap. If White wants to  continue here, 'a' is the normal move.]
;B[jp];W[jo];B[in]C[EE: Very bad aji  keshi! Black should not force  White to connect. One should never play next to a useful cutting point.]
;W[io];B[lq];W[lo];B[kq];W[pj]C[EE: That is indeed a good point.];B[qh]
;W[oh];B[rj];W[qf]L[jl][il][kj]M[qh][rj]C[NM: It seemed to  me that if I played R8 and let him take R14 he had too easy a game....

EE: Well, it is true that Black is leading, but this move feels like an  overplay. After the R8-R14 exchange,  you might actually get some points in the center by pressing on his  central  group. Imagine Wa-Bb-Wc  for example. You have to use the thickness you've got at the bottom to attack  that group of  his.]
;B[pg];W[pf]M[oh]C[EE: Ouch! This move hurts White's  marked stone below. I would  suggest to go for san-san here instead.]
;B[og];W[of];B[ng]L[nc][nd]M[oh]C[EE: Locally, this is splendid  for Black, but now he has to endure a White attack against his corner. 'a'  and 'b' were the "safe"  alternatives.

The pressure is now on White though, he has to get the most out of his attack  to compensate for pushing  Black from behind out into the sun, hurting the marked stone so badly in the  process.]
;W[nd];B[od]L[nc]C[EE: Strange. 'a' is the normal  move.];W[qc]L[ne]
M[pf][og][of][ng][od][nd]C[EE: I expected 'a'  here. If White was going for san-san after  all, I think it would have been better to leave out the marked  exchanges.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[ne];W[nf];B[me]
(;W[nc]C[NM:  I think I should have  gone N14 to keep the fight going.

EE: It would justify O14, but I'm not sure that it would lead to anything  positive (see  var.)]
;B[mf];W[jc]L[hb]C[EE: How about sliding all the way to 'a'?  White is strong in the top right so it might  work, although it feels like a handicap move. White has to confuse things,  since he is  behind.]
;B[ic];W[jb];B[ib];W[bc];B[bb];W[jf]L[qk]C[NM: Should K14 have  been K15? or indeed tenuki?

EE: Tenuki. All groups around here are safe. "Don't play close to thickness."  'a' is a big move to use the  tenuki for. White would need to make 25-30 points in the LR quarter of the  board to make it close. It's very  difficult, but White's only hope.]

unlikely that White can win the ko. Please also note that compared to the  game, White has more to lose on this ko than Black (assuming 'b' and 'c' as  Black ko threats to keep the bottom group sound).]

[gg]C[EE: Maybe something like this happens. From here it gets  complicated
and I'm sorry, but I can't show a tactical variation that explicitly
shows why the Wa-Bb exchange helps Black. It seems White can't cut at
'b' directly, but I hope you agree that Black'a marked stones are a
bit short of liberties, which could make a difference in the fight.
To exchange Wa for Bb here would help Black a lot.]))
(;W[fj];B[df];W[de]C[Note that White has the choice on which side to atari, thus  he's got
the flexibility and Black must be sure that *all* variations are
plausible for him. This is one explanation to why these kinds of crude
cuts are so rare in pro games.

I think that D15 is the best choice for White here, although D13 (which you  mentioned) is also possible.]
