Hi my name is Olivier (pseudo pochin), I'm from France. I play around 10 Kyu, and I had three stones at the beginning during this game.

I'm still a beginner and I would like someone stronger to show me my main mistakes, especially during the fuseki. I think I also have problem about direction, so any commentary about this would be great.

Thank you very much.

Hi, I am Karen (I play as NannyOgg on KGS), I will be happy to review your game. I just did a quick run through your game and wanted to bring up shygost and his 'The List'. It is a good way of helping you to decide what;s urgent on the board. 
http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shygost has the full list, I will just summarize here:
Ask yourself those questions:
1. Am I ok? No? defend!
2. Is he ok? No? attack!
3. Where are the big areas?

If you play using those questions, it will help your play. He also has free audio lectures on KGS, every Friday night at 7pm PST.]
;W[dd];B[fc]C[Is it good to approach at the beginning?
I was thinking of playing Q10 or K4

Yes, approaching is good. Handicap stones are for attacking, not for defending. This shows the right spirit.]
;W[cn]
(;B[jd]LB[cf:A][fp:B]C[I was also thinking about playing a pincer around D9

This move is not bad, but I would prefer a move at A or B. W played tenuki from the UL corner, should punish]
;W[nq]
(;B[pn]C[Not a bad move, just showing some alternatives.];W[pf]
;B[nd];W[qd];B[qc];W[qe]
(;B[ci]C[I thought it could be good to separte the white stones in two groups. I was also thinking about K4.

Good idea. K4 is good move too
Or locally, maybe just C14, punish W for that tenuki.];W[rc]
;B[qb]C[Is it the usual answer, or is Q18 better?

This is fine. But it would have been better to play S17 yourself.]
;W[cf];B[cl];W[fq];B[eo]C[I hesitated between this move and C3. I thought it would be better to go to the center than to take the corner.

Yes, getting out is good here.];W[cq];B[cp]C[I played C4 and not D3, because I think it was working better with my stones in the left

Sure];W[dq]
(;B[jp]C[I was thinking of playing B3, but I finally decided to isolate the white stone at O3. Maybe K3 would have been better.]
;W[ql]C[I don't know how to answer this. I was thinking about my corner. I thought that playing a move such as R7 was wrong because white could then add a stone at Q11 or R11, building a big moyo on the right. And after that the corner was not mine yet, an invasion was still possible.


Right, R7 is wrong, bad shape and corner is still open. 
Usually, B would pincer around R11, but not with the strong W group there. 
Not sure what's best B move here, maybe just getting out.]
(;B[qj]C[So I decided to pincer.];W[ol];B[oj];W[fe];B[hd];W[rn]
C[Same as before, I don't know how to answer this.];B[rp]C[This seems ok
BUt I really would have preferred B to get out earlier (the move at P7 instead of the pincer)]
;W[rb]C[Yes, there is the cut, but it's just points , it doesn't affect the life of your group

Look at the board now, and ask yourself the questions.
1. am I ok?  B looks ok everywhere
2. is he ok? W actually has a few weak groups, R8, O3

The R8 group has the most stones, so attacking it might be a good idea]

(;B[dm]C[I was thinking of killing those stones to have a big territory and then extend to the center. I was also thinking about playing the forcing move Q7 and then escape to the center with O7]
;W[on]C[now, i can't escape, and white is building a strong wall]
;B[ro];W[ec]C[is it too late to invade the corner?

There might still be a ko, not sure];B[fd];W[pm];B[qn];W[ep]

(;B[dn]C[I was afraid of the cut at D5. But I think my move is bad (see following). Maybe playing C5 is better.]
