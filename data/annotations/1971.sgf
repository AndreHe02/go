C[endgame (24k) vs. mgriffin (28k)
July 14th, 2002

Hello, my name is Mike Griffin (mgriffin on IGS), and I played as black in this game.  My rank is not set yet in IGS, and I just assigned myself 28k because I have only played for a month and a half at this point and I don't consider myself very good.  I am having a problem right now trying to figure out what I need to do to improve.  I know there are a lot of things I need to work on, but I do not know what they are.  I will admit now that I do not know many joseki patterns at all, so a lot of my moves may look and/or be incorrect.

In this game, I felt that I started well but I made some mistakes early on that gave the white player a large advantage throughout the middle game.

Ted:  I'm Ted Schuerzinger, and have marked all my comments with my first name so that you'll know which ones are mine.

I think the biggest mistake you made was never really attacking your opponent.  You had a lot of chances to attack at the top, and never did so.

I've specifically avoided making any comments about the first several moves, simply because joseki is not an important thing for beginners to learn.  There's a proverb that goes something like "learning joseki loses two stones; studying joseki gains four stones".  The point behind this is that if you simply 'learn' joseki (ie memorize a series of moves), you're liable to have no idea what to do if your opponent plays a move you haven't seen.  And if both of you do follow a standard sequence correctly, you may not have any idea what to do with the group next.  You didn't notice (until the end of the game) the defect left behind at D5, for example.  All I'd recommend regarding josekis is to know one or two things that come up a lot (such as what the 3-3 invasions against a 4-4 stone look like).]

;B[cp];W[jd];B[pj]C[Ted: I'm not so sure I like this move.  There's a go proverb which says 'the fourth line is for influence, the third line for territory'.  Players stronger than me will also add that it's best to have a balance between stones on the third line and stones on the fourth.  So, R10 is probably better than Q10.

If you feel more comfortable attacking, you might want to try an approach at R14 instead.]
;W[qg];B[qj]C[Ted: I think this is why you should have played at R10 first instead of Q10.  If you had played at R10, you could easily respond to White's R13 with a move like R7.  If you were to try that here, it would not be as good because White could slide in at S10.]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[mgriffin:  Here I have a feeling that I should have played Q6 instead of R5 because it would have helped me to keep white from separating my corner from the stones at Q10.  During the game I didn't want white getting under my corner though.

Ted: Letting White get a small amount of territory in the corner in exchange for a wall may not be so bad, because the wall would work well with the stone at K4.]
;W[pn];B[op]C[Ted: I think this is too small.  I have a feeling you're worried about a cut, but you can play safely at O4.]
;W[nn];B[rl];W[rn];B[rh];W[rg];B[sh]C[Ted: I think this move is slow, despite the idea of trying to create two eyes on the side (which I presume was the intention).  I think R12 is better.]
;W[oh];B[nj];W[lp];B[lq];W[mq];B[kq];W[lo];B[nq];W[mp];B[mr]
;W[jo];B[ip]C[mgriffin:  Here I think I should have tried to break out from the right side with my stones.  Instead, I built a wall on the bottom and let white seal me out.  I knew from this point that it would be very difficult making territory anywhere near the center.

Ted: Well, you don't necessarily have to make territory in the center to win, IF you can stop your opponent from getting territory in the center and get more territory on the sides and corners.  I think you now need to consider the left side (someplace around C11) or an approach to either D16 or Q16 as the big moves.]
;W[io];B[hp];W[ok]
(;B[pk]C[mgriffin:  Here I was trying to make eyespace for my group, but I should have not given up O10.]
;W[oj];B[ql];W[ni];B[dj]C[mgriffin:  This was a move I was wanting to play as soon as white played D7.  I knew that it would put some pressure on his 3 white stones near my bottom left corner and it also would give me some influence in the center.]
;W[ck];B[dk]C[Ted: I like C10 more, as it makes the White territory smaller, and threatens to make a nice base with a play next at something in the C14 area.]
;W[cj];B[di];W[ci];B[fl];W[hl];B[gj];W[ij];B[df]C[mgriffin:  The center area now looked nearly impossible for me to penetrate, so I decided to pick up some easy territory with D14.

Ted: The territory isn't so easy, and it's not much territory.  Plus, note that by pushing on the fourth line, you've made it quite easy for your opponent to play on the third line -- and pick up territory all the while.  This is the reason why I think if would have been better for you to play at C10 when you played at D9.]
;W[cf];B[de];W[ce];B[fe];W[ed];B[ee];W[fd];B[ge]C[Ted: Pushing here does no good -- you're giving White too much territory on the side.  O17 would be better here.]
;W[hd];B[he];W[ie];B[gd];W[gc];B[hc];W[id]
(;B[if]TR[fa][fc][af][bf][ef][hf][ei][hi]C[Ted: This is much too small.  Look at the rectangle of territory you can expect to get, versus what White has.  In addition to what I've marked, White should be able to get more territory to the right of H17.  Additionally, an attack at O17 will now be more difficult because of the White group in the top center.   Alternatively, I'd try F17 here and hope that you can create enought attacks to pick up one of the groups.  White has been fortunate enough to leave you cutting points at F17, C16, and C13.  I've included a few variations.]
;W[jf];B[ig];W[jg];B[ii];W[ji];B[jh];W[kh];B[ih]C[mgriffin:  and white did a very good job of sealing me in and minimizing the damage to himself.

Ted: You also did a good job of letting White seal you in by not playing more aggressively.  An attack at F17 or O17 should have come a while back.]
;W[kj];B[hj];W[ik];B[dl];W[em];B[fm];W[cl];B[el];W[cm];B[gn]
C[mgriffin:  This was a move that I hoped could start a small invasion between white's stones, but with nothing on the other side, it would prove to be too difficult.    Ted: Note that the cut at F17 can still be played.]
;W[qc];B[sg]
(;W[sf]C[Ted: Your opponent is too kind.  White should have played at S15 here.]
;B[rf];W[qf];B[re];W[rd];B[qe];W[pe];B[se];W[hb];B[ch];W[bh]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[dg]C[Ted: This move is unnecessary and gives up sente.  If White tries to atari at D12 or D13, White won't be able to make two eyes. And Black is connected to the stones at the bottom as well.  B4, B5, or S5 are probably the best moves here -- although you're far enough behind that none of those will make a difference.]
;W[cd];B[ol];W[nk];B[nl]C[mgriffin:  I almost thought I had a chance to break out and do some damage here.]
;W[ml]
(;B[on]C[Ted: This move is a mistake.  If you're going to play in this area, you should play at either N7, threatening a double atari at N9, or N9 immediately, followed by N7.]

;W[so];B[qp];W[rq];B[qq];W[qr];B[pr];W[rr];B[qs]C[Fedya: This move is too small for.  B4 or B5 would be better.]
;W[rs];B[ps];W[bp];B[bq];W[bo];B[br]C[mgriffin:  On the exchanges in the two bottom corners, I feel that I could have saved a few points of territory if I didn't play so defensively, but I have been hurt too many times by moves to cut my stones near the edges.

Ted: In the bottom left, you're right that D5 is a defect that White can use to bother you.  And on the right side, there wasn't much you could do once your opponent played S4.  D5 and S4 are the sorts of important points your opponent can use in the endgame to take away a lot of territory.]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[pi];B[rm];W[sn];B[sm];W[sj]
(;B[rj]C[mgriffin:  I think this move was a big mistake along with my moves to follow.  I thought I had a nice impenetrable group here, but I could not figure out how to save it.

Ted: S9 does a very good job of saving it.];W[rk];B[qk];W[sk]
;B[mk];W[mj];B[lk]C[mgriffin:  This was a desperate move by me that I should not have attempted.

Ted: In for a penny, in for a pound.  If you're going to lose anyhow, it might not be such a bad thing to see how your opponent refutes what you think are your bad moves.]
;W[ll];B[kk];W[jk];B[kl];W[km];B[jl];W[il];B[lc]C[mgriffin:  I was ready to resign at this point, but I wanted to see how effectively white could stop an invasion in an area like this just for future reference.]
;W[nc];B[nb];W[ob];B[ma];W[mb];B[lb];W[mc]C[mgriffin:  Here is where I resigned.  I had a little conversation with the white player here asking what I could do to improve, but he told me that he didn't feel he was good enough to give advice.  I really want to learn more.  Currently, the way in which I improve is by playing on IGS to get more experience under my belt and studying the 1900+ reviewed games on the Go Teaching Ladder.  I feel that I am missing important concepts that dictate why players make certain moves in the games though.  Thank you in advance for a review of this game.

Ted: Of course you're missing important concepts!  Even amateur dan players will tell you *they're* missing important concepts.  :-)  More seriously, I once sent in a game for review in which I had thickness (much like your wall facing the center early on) and said that I'm never quite certain what to do with thickness.  The reviewer, who was about 5 kyu, told me that stronger players than him would disagree on what one should do with thickness.  So, what are the most important things for you to do?

1) Play, play, play.  Then play some more.  Getting groups killed is a good, if severe, way of learning what *not* to do.
2) Life and Death problems will help you save positions like the one you had on the right side, as well as help you to find opponents' shapes that can be killed.
3) Attack more early in the game.  I think you failed to attack anywhere on the top, and this really hurt you.  And look for cutting points that your opponent has left.  You mentioned that you played passively in the corners at the end of the game because you were worried about being cut.  Yet your opponent left you a serious cutting point at F17, and you never played it!]
