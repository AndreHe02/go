C[A: Hello! Thank you for the questions and the game. My comments will be marked with 'A'.]

;B[bb];W[db];B[ef];W[cj]C[the joseki is k17 so how should I now play? Is j17 ok?

A: j17 is natural, but that's where the story begins. It is almost necessary to have a plan here, because all the three groups aren't settled.]
;B[ic];W[ge]
(;B[fd]C[A: I don't like this move: white gets a wall of 3 stones, and your stone at j17 isn't as strong as White. Should we switch to —Å8?]
;W[gd];B[fc];W[fb]C[this was stupid, just shortening the liberties of the group. I thought I could cut white but didn't read properly.

A: Yes, it's more interesting to get f18 later (f17 or g18 next, so White has no eyes). You are now interested in these stones, not in the strength of your group - and that resulted in a loss.]
;B[hb];W[gb];B[fe];W[lc]
(;B[oc]C[is this ok?

A: No - it doesn't affect White at all, and k16 next is very painful.]

(;W[be]C[A: What is White doing?];B[ie];W[bd];B[bc];W[ce];B[dd]
;W[gg];B[eh];W[ig];B[ke];W[dq]
(;B[fq]C[I wanted to have the bottom side but I didn't :D at the end of the joseki I didn't like my result

A: Yes, that's why c8 was very imprortant before: as soon as c10 group becomes strong, your c5 stone becomes weak. f3 is used for counter-attacking purposes, but not in this case.]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[dn]C[maybe I should have sacrificed the corner? k3 here?

A: Yes - White gets a good position, but you'll get something too.]

(;B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[eo];B[br];W[er];B[cs];W[dr];B[bm];W[iq]
;B[md]LB[kg:1]C[A: I see, it's slow and one-goal-oriented. I'd like to start an attack with 1, making e14 group stronger (goal 1), destroying White's center potential (goal 2) and getting n16 eventually, because White has no time to care about two weak groups (goal 3).]
;W[jd];B[id];W[if];B[je];W[qe]
(;B[rd]C[A: You are very strong at the top, and White's r15 is a provocation. Which strategy do you prefer: 
'-Okay, I'll close my 10 points and attack later' 
or 
'-You are close to my stones, you should be eaten or attacked heavily at least?']
;W[oe]
(;B[qn];W[qk];B[qq]TR[dn][eo][ep][dq][iq][dr][er]C[double approach here? at o3 or o4? is it any better than this?

A: White (triangle-marked group) is strong at the bottom, so I doubt that a double approach can help - you'll just create second weak group.
The thing is: you started fighting not at the top (where you're much stronger than these 2 stones), but around White's corner, just helping White to close his potential moyo at the bottom.]

;W[qj];B[ok];W[re]
(;B[qh];W[pi]C[A: Even when White gave up the fighting and didn't answer q14, he got much more in the center than you on the side. So you can't give up p9 stones, right?]
;B[pf];W[ni];B[pe];W[mj];B[he]C[now I thought that I could make white eyeless and lead him to his own territory so that I could make it smaller. Maybe I should have played something around k5 now?

A: It's a good plan, k5 seems potentially dead here.];W[gf]

;B[mk]C[A:];W[lk];B[ll]C[A: Yes, you can cut, that's great. But, please, connect with f11 first (and that would be almost sente - White needs to defend his group).]
;W[ml];B[mm];W[nk];B[km];W[kn];B[ln];W[il];B[jk];W[hj]C[A: Now it's White who attacks, and I can't admit that.]

[gg:4][cj:1][mn:7][ip:6][dq:2]C[after seeing this game, what do you think are the main areas for me to concentrate as a player? Thank you very much for the review, I appreciate it very much!

A: Well, excluding some reading mistakes (that happens with every player, that's OK) - I'd like to see your courage on the board. In this game:
- you didn't attack (1) group, so White attacked your corner with (2);
- White didn't attack (3), so you got the top side, and (4) group remained weak;
- you didn't attack (5) stone, so White got a good position on the left side;
- you didn't attack (4), so White attacked your center stones;
- White didn't attack your bottom group after (6), so you got alive (but he cut (7) and was ahead with that).

So, I hope you know what to do in your next game ;)

Good luck,

(;B[cl]C[A: Obviously, White has to answer. But if White answers somewhere around E13, that hurts his top group.
Also, we have 2 stones, not one, so many other corner variations become possible. For 3-5 stone, side-oriented, this is important.]
