C[I like to play pincer except in handicap games

Cook: Handicap games in normally better to pincer.];B[qg];W[nc]
;B[od]C[just read about this move somewhere as the initial response to R 15

cook: I dont see anywere O17 a joseki I like your reply to W move.]
;W[me];B[pe]C[attacking whites stone

cook: Normally you dont attack to what you want to attack. Q14 seems better. (P17 even looks like it should work.)]
;W[jd]LB[cf:A]C[cook: If I had to pick I like B, I move in on the the A side/area now. (my style though.)]
;B[qj]LB[pe:A]C[A group solid with anoff stones played in that area.

cook: This move is Very small, its normally made for when W splidding would be bad and you need to make a stone stable.(give a bace) - But B is just fine on both sides.]
;W[dj]TR[dd][jd][dp]SQ[pc][pe][qg][qj][qo][pq]C[W seems to have expaned across the board more. (just with that one move.)]
;B[cg]LB[ce:A][dj:B]C[not sure if this was a good idea but I thought if I let white play there then white gets a lot of territory

cook: W can play A and the B stone can annoy you.];W[dg]C[cook: Attack dont attach. Good for you though. :)]
;B[ch];W[ci];B[dh];W[df];B[be]C[securing eyespace/ invading]
;W[bd];B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[ee]SQ[ed][ef]C[cook: there to cuts like this makes one think there would be something there. Sadly I not at the level to say what. but it is a shape thing to tell you when you see in a game to try and find something. (being two cuts some bad omen or something that I have read.[no idea if omen spelled right.\])]
;B[eh];W[ff]C[cook: Feels like this helping W. He can now pertect his weak point and B didn't really get to help himself.]
;B[gh];W[cl];B[fq];W[fo];B[iq];W[lp];B[mq];W[jo];B[io]LB[fj:A]
C[cook: A move can probably do What your move here was thinking (if you were trying to reduse) And make your weak gruup strong.]
;W[in]LB[ho:A]C[cook: A shape feels better to me.];B[jp];W[ho]
;B[ip];W[kn]SQ[io][ip][jp][iq]C[cook: a bit clumb now.];B[ko]
;W[jn];B[lo]C[cook: not big anough for this stage of the game.]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[qc];B[qb];W[rb];B[rc];W[pb];B[qd];W[oc]LB[fj:A]
C[cook: I leave it alone and play else were. I keep seeing move A. maybe better moves of course.]
;B[ob];W[nb];B[pa];W[ln];B[mo];W[pl];B[ql];W[qm];B[qk];W[pn]
C[cook: If W had played move move up (Q7) you not been able to connect under.]
;B[rm];W[rn];B[qn];W[pm];B[sn]C[cook: S5 feels better shape.]
;W[op];B[pp];W[oo];B[nq]C[cook: ok W played this horribly.]
;W[fi]C[cook: long waited attack.];B[fh];W[gi];B[gf]C[cook: his idea of attacking you is right though.]
;W[ge];B[fg];W[ef]C[cook: seem fine.];B[hf]LB[gf:A]C[cook: bit slow now. A stone not really inportent.]

;B[dq];W[gp];B[ep];W[eo];B[bp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn]C[cook: W giveing you way to much.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[an];W[bl];B[am]LB[bq:A]C[cook: your better to just come back at A here. W cant take that stone in the next move. So if latter you end up needing to get rid of the stone B7 you can do so more freely and cheaply. (say ko for one example.)]
;W[aj];B[cm];W[dm];B[bq];W[bh];B[on];W[bg]C[this was a blunder

cook: I missed this blunder too. ^^];B[ne]LB[gq:A]C[A move at G3 is really big.]

;W[om];B[di];W[cj];B[ei];W[ej];B[oi];W[nk];B[pj];W[ok];B[ph]
C[cook: There no reason I see for you needing to take this stones at all.]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[hc];B[nd]LB[na:B][po:A]C[cook: The A move at Q5 just asking for you. Shoot even B move is.]
;W[eg];B[gg];W[eq];B[er];W[hq];B[hr];W[hp];B[gr];W[kp];B[kq]
;W[po]LB[np:A]TR[mo][no][mq][nq]C[cook: This shape is connected. (unless you dont anwser if W tries to cut) So you not play a move like A unless your trying to take libs from W stones. (That is not the case in this game.)]
(;B[np]C[cook: A move is MUCH better. (look at tree to see it.)]
;W[oq];B[or]LB[pr:A]C[W cut on the wrong side in the actual game with (O2 that was in the actual game.)

(plays it out, look in tree.)]

cook: I hope this helped, I tryed to put basic idea I felt was missing in the game. You are free to submit other games to me though sadly I am slow to reply with the review. Sorry for the wait on this game was well.

Good Luck!])
