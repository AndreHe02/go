C[I have trouble in dealing with pincers..this game is a prime example :-(

jpl: Just a little about me.  I'm about an 8kyu player.  I've played go for a long time, but have trouble finding people to play with locally.]
;B[pp]C[ritz [17k\]: salut];W[dd]C[Ash [17k?\]: good evening from derby england
ritz [17k\]: thank you];B[dq];W[qd];B[co];W[jq];B[hq]C[In hindsight, G3 may have been better

jpl: yeah, I think you're right.  H3 is begging for an invasion.]
;W[mq];B[qj]C[Q6 seemed to be not forcing enough but..

jpl: I don't know if this is a good move -- maybe talk to a stronger player.  I would have been tempted to play either at P2 or R6.  R10 is just threatening more invasions.  Q4 is looking pretty lonely right now.]
;W[qn]C[he invaded again

Yeah.  But it's not really an invasion, because the right side isn't really your territory yet.  Your stones on the right side don't work to secure the side, they are just there for influence.]
;B[qq]C[jpl: That's very cautious, and it's not what I would have done.  I'd probably have played S4.  If he then invaded around p2, you can push on him and probably secure big territory on the right.

R3 secures the corner, but it'll be an exceedingly small corner.]
;W[on];B[qg]C[I was looking throughout this game for solid moves on 3/4 rank and this was aimed at creating a base

jpl: and as such, it's a solid move.];W[fq]TR[er][gr]LB[fp:B]
[fr:A]C[yet another invasion

jpl: You know you CAN connect these, right?  For instance, to connect via B, play at A.  It's fairly common at that point to play at either diamond, wllowing you to then play at B. You'll want to play with this, but you can connect if you want to.  It's just a tradeoff from being able to do other things.]
;B[ho];W[fo];B[hm]C[i wondered about K5 here

jpl: Hmm.  Maybe the knights move to k6 or j7 instead.  It depends on what you're trying to accomplish.]
;W[in];B[jc]C[trying to counter attack

jpl: that's not an attack though.  If you want to attack, then you attack.  Pick a corner and play joseki moves to attack.

Your stone at K17 is influence and makes it slightly more difficult for white to secure the entire top side.  But it's very lonely there right now and easily pushed upon from either side -- and pushing on you will serve to secure more territory for white than you'll get in the process.]
;W[lc];B[gc]C[the solid base move

jpl: but that's what I mean.  White got a huge extension from the upper right corner and you have a small, insecure location on the top side.  I don't consider that an even trade.  Granted, white needs one more play around p17 to secure the top right side, but he could do that right now, be the same place he was with sente prior to your play at k17, and have come out ahead.]
;W[oc]C[jpl: which is what he did.  That was a solid play on white's part.]
;B[hn]C[i wondered whether better to continue with E18 or C10 or c14. But i was concerned that i already had 5 groups and we had not yet reached 25 moves

jpl: You can also use this opportunity to more aggressively attack the upper left with a play around D14.  However, this can get really messy.]
;W[gp];B[hp];W[eq];B[cq]C[aiming for wall along c/d ranks as opposed to playing D2]
;W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[eb]C[jpl: this isn't a bad move, but I don't know that it's a very big move, either.  You need to look around and ask if this is the biggest move on the board for you.

it's about a 10 point move or so.  I'm sure there are bigger moves.

But thinking about it, i think it was a fair exchange for you and white.  You secured your stop side and gained a few more points.  White secured the top left while leaving an opportunity for you to limit his territory on the left side later.]
;W[cb];B[dn];W[en];B[dm];W[gq];B[dj]C[looking to establish position along LHS]
;W[ck]C[i have trouble with these 4th line extensions and then opponent creeps underneath..perhaps i should stick to 3rd line

jpl: naw.  I'll have comments at the end for you, but basically the 4th line is more about maintaining influence towards the center.  If you give that up, you'll lose BIG points in the middle.

Basically you just need to learn how to play it.  You come out of this sequence okay.]
;B[cj];W[dk];B[ek];W[el];B[dl]C[willing to sacrifice e9];W[em]
;B[bk];W[ej];B[cl]C[jpl: I would have extended at F9 first.  This causes more trouble for his stones.  It threatens to connect to your long group on the H-line.  It creates center influence and also strengthens your influence towards the stones on the top side.  It puts additional pressure on the stone at E10.

Instead, when he plays at F9, he forces you to cover at D9 and bottles you in.

This is a pretty big difference.  I think it's makes or breaks this game for you.

If you look around at secure territory, you have a solid lower left corner and you'll gain some territory in the lower right.  The left side is also fairly big for you, and you're not done there.  White has some territory on the lower side and some in the upper right.  Upper left will be split between both of you.

If you can either connect to your stones on the H line -or- make a solid wall while he kills you, you win.]
;W[fk];B[dk];W[fj];B[cg]C[so back to 3rd line instead of playing D13. I did consider  c/d 14 but worried about more invasion at say c12

jpl: D13 is a pretty strong move given the influence of your stones on the top.  At this point, you should already be worried about your stones on the H line, they're clearly boxed in pretty hard.  C13 is clearly abandoning them.  When you played C13, you basically told white "you can have those stones on the H line".]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[cf];B[dg]C[jpl: D13 is a VERY small move.  You can afford E13.  You can maybe play E14 -- threatening to connect to the upper side.]
;W[ee];B[je]C[G15 better?

jpl: I don't know.  K15 isn't bad.  But...  You're working on center influence, but you aren't really that secure in either group on the right side.  You want to think about that strategically.

K15 works with your stones on the right side -- you threaten to connect way across the board.  G15 only threatens to connect to the left side, which really isn't that important (yet).]
;W[jj]C[a killing move which eventually resulted in me losing H5 grp..and hence game. I knew i had to create 2 eyes or run and connect..and i failed

jpl: I don't think those stones need to die.  I just think you played it too heavily and let yourself get boxed in.]
;B[im];W[jn]SQ[ll]CR[kn][lm]TR[jm]MA[il]LB[jk:4][jl:1][kk:3]
[kl:2][km:5]C[jpl: In anticipation of your move, I wanted to number the sequence I like.

At this point, he has to decide whether to cut at the triangle and let you take at the diamond or do it the other way.

If he extends at the square, you connect, then you get pushed towards one of the circle.

if he cuts at the triangle, you then capture at the square.  He'll cut at the X, but you can chew him up and make him decide to either let you connect or lose at least as many stones and some big territory.  You might be able to squeese out the top or capture the stones at K6.]
;B[jm];W[km];B[hk]LB[kn:A]C[thinking of an eye space with second eye around h2

jpl: what about playing at A instead?  That has some interesting variations that all turn into life or at least allow you to chew up his stones pretty good.

Always watch for cutting points.  It's often suicide, but in the process, you can chew your opponent to pieces.

If your opponent plays atari at M6, you extend to L5 and you've captured the stones at J&K6.

If he plays atari at L5, you extend to M6.  At that point, you again can capture the stones at J/K 6 and/or chase the stone at L7 into oblivion (saving your huge group of stones).

If he plays elsewhere, you can end up doing both of the above.

L6 is a VERY big move for you here.];W[hj];B[ik];W[jk];B[ij]

C[was just looking to gain territory centred on h16];W[me];B[le]
;W[kd];B[ke]C[jpl: I would have connected with K16 instead.  Your stop stones aren't as strong and you can afford a poke at L15 if K16 is filled.]
;W[jd];B[id];W[kc];B[jb];W[mg];B[ql]C[expanding RHS base..but i plaayed badly in that area just a little later. I still think that R8-R13 should give me room to live]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[mh];B[kh];W[lj];B[ol]C[looking to creep into his territory

;W[oj];B[ml];W[kl];B[jl];W[pk];B[pl];W[qk];B[rk];W[rm];B[rl]
;W[nm];B[qm]C[jpl: I hate this move.  You have sente and you use it to force him to make his stone at S7 stronger, which makes your stones in the lower right weaker.  Almost any play on the board is better for you than R7.]
;W[rn];B[nl]C[jpl: I'm not fond of this move when compared to something around Q11 or 12.]

jpl: why?  I like Q10.];W[ok];B[pi];W[qh];B[ph];W[rg];B[rh]
C[jpl: you do realize that he's got some serious trouble with his stones at Q9?  Easily attacked.  Look at all the cutting points around here.  Play with them and you can find some interesting opportunities.]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[sh]C[Ash [17k?\]: you are too good for me..G5 grp is dead, correcxt?]
;B[sj]C[ritz [17k\]: yes];W[si]C[Ash [17k?\]: then i think it is time i resigned and stopped wasting any more of your time..
Ash [17k?\]: thank you for the game
ritz [17k\]: thank you very much
ritz [17k\]: :-)
Ash [17k?\]: good night
ritz [17k\]: you too
Ash [17k?\]: at least it will help to get me back to a 'proper' grading

jpl: final comments....

You put too much effort into moves trying to save the group on the H-line.  You used fairly small moves, and you gave him a huge wall to contain you in the process.

You also handled the right side poorly, and I have to wonder if you can even make that group live.

That being said....

I think you played well for your rank.  You are clearly thinking about the right things.

Things to think about....

-Always ask yourself "am I making the biggest move on the board?"  Even if you are saving a stone with the move, if you don't need that particular zone, you should wonder if it's the best move.

-Periodically think about what you want, strategically speaking.  Form goals.

-Remember that stones cast influence all the way across the board.  Be aware of that influence.  Be aware of moves that:

A. Play off that influence
B. Could be used against you to bottle up that influence
C. Extend the influence to create territory

-Moves at the center star points are fuseki, but they WILL be subject to invasion.  Live with it.  The stone defines influence, not territory.  You need to decide what you're going to do with that influence.

-I'd go back to early in the game and see if you can connect H3 to D3 with a play at F2 or F4.  Just get a board and try stuff.]
