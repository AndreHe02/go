C[om3: hi reviewer.

thank you for agreeing to do a review on my game. i already put some thoughts on it and would be very glad, if you could check and complete them!]

;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[co]C[om3: here i was not sure...

This is a very peculiar move...
Usually if W wants to emphasize the left side, she would play the variation below....

By playing this variation W gives up more in the corner, and fails to properly enclose black.]

(;B[eq]C[This is fine. You still come out ahead as compared to if W had simply played C4 instead of this half-hearted variant.]
;W[ho]C[You leave in sente and W's stones at h5 don't threaten much. Take note when your opponent plays like this, however. It means influence is going to be very important to them. You can't keep your head down and ignore the center when move 16 gives major local loss in order to get some center strength.]
;B[qp]TR[fc][jc][ci]C[I don't think this corner play, which is emphasizing the right, is the most important area for you. 

If you already had R4 and played P3 it would be different, but already having P3 I may suggest an approach elsewhere. H3 does not effectively attack P3 and B can always slide to M3, hurting H3's expandibility, later. 

Any of the marked areas I would recommend more.];W[qj]
(;B[cf]TR[ci]SQ[fc][jc][di]C[om3: probably too close?

Not as much "Too close" as I'm not sure it's the right direction... I'd favor any of the marked moves more]

;W[hc]
(;B[kp]C[om3: probably i should react here?

Reacting topside would favor you better. By ignoring an approach to your open skirt you end up in a very weak position, particularly with such a long extension.]

;W[ge];B[fe];W[gb];B[pn]C[From this point on it feels like you're thrashing. Just playing wild moves in the hopes that something would work, but not striking at any particular aji more complicated than a glance.]

guerecon [3k\]: I think its over


More thrashing. The ladder wipes time information from the game, but usually when I see play like this, I see 2-3 seconds a move.]

(;B[ll]C[I believe this works for B. Cutting W's cutting stones apart in a shape very close to the crane's nest. All of W's stones in the area have to live in order for W to kill your group. 

There are sometimes openings that will appear in a fight, but random moves will rarely find them. Take your time, look for cutting points, and read them out.]

For all the lines I can see stemming from this, yes, it seems to work.]

At the very least it strengthens your shape while threatening the cut at O13, making it more likely for you to connect back.]

I read a lot of difficulty in black's shape stemming from the jump of one on the 3rd line.]

(;B[jc]C[B can live after a tenuki. C15 isn't as valuable as a move elsewhere would be.  Particularly since W's natural reply strengthens W in an area you don't want W any stronger.]

(;B[ci]C[om3: with the benefit of hindsight, i wouldve played like this.

This works better, as it is a more difficult position for W to deal with. 

D11 is another option to consider]))
