RU[Japanese]

C[Hi.  Thank you for taking the time to review my game.  I am NathanA playing black in this game.
--
S> Hello there, NathanA. All of my comments will begin with the S> symbol.
--
S> It looks like a good place for you to focus your study would be pressure/priorities. I feel like white is pushing black around here, and black loses sight of what's important. Let's have a look.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[op]LB[po:C][qp:A][pq:B]TR[dp]C[S> This isn't a bad move, but the shimari with A points toward your stone up top, which means your prospects for development are somewhat limited. A shimari at B-C is therefore more common (and, I think, easier to deal with) because it looks white's stone dead in the eye and says "I'm coming for you" or "Come and get me."]
;W[dc];B[qp];W[ce];B[qk]LB[jd:B][fq:C][mq:A]C[q16,p4,r4 is an opening I have been using for awhile.  I generally like it.  This fourth move I am alittle unsure about.  Usually white will play an approach to the q16 stone so I am more used to answering that with this move.  Either that or Wq10.  Guess my question is:  Is this an ok place for this move?
--
S> This definitely feels overcrowded. One of my biggest concerns as black would be a  white approach at A, which doesn't have an easy solid answer.Because white's shimari points toward the top, a move at B is a good approach, since that is a point for optimal white expansion in that area. A black approach at C is also decent, since it works with the bottom-right shimari to make a sizeable framework.]
;W[jq];B[lq]C[a kibitzer mentioned k17 might have been better for this move.
--
S> As I mentioned, that would be good -- but responding to white's approach on the bottom also makes sense.]
;W[jo]C[S> The question, then, is -- of course -- how to react to white's ever-expanding moyo.]
;B[dk]C[S> A fourth-line invasion is usually most necessary later in the game. I like to invade on the third line at a point like this, since it's easier to settle. But this is definitely the right idea.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[cn];W[fp];B[hd]LB[cg:A][ch:B]
[bp:C]TR[dk]C[I was trying to keep white cut up here and it seemed my lower left group had enough room to live.  As the game unfolds I am not sure this was the best strategy.  Would something like 'A' or 'B' have been better?
--
S> Well, if black plays at either A or B, then white will almost certainly take the H16 spot. The question you have to ask yourself is: Is that a problem? Black's left moyo will then be about the size of (maybe a bit smaller than) white's corner; and white's top will be about the size of black's right side. The danger is that black's right side would be less fortified than white's top, if white were able to play H16. So I think that, yes, this is an appropriate move. (Again, I would invade on the third line.)
--
S> The black group on the left is okay in terms of stability (it would be even more so if the marked black stone were on the third line).. Black can slide to C, if necessary.]
;W[fc];B[cp]C[S> Never mind this. That black soldier is under attack, and he needs support, pronto. Head for the middle!]
;W[cq];B[bp];W[ch];B[dq]C[S> Again, that soldier up top needs help. Deal with this stuff later.]
;W[eq];B[do];W[dr];B[ci];W[dh];B[bi]C[My opponent questioned these two moves after the game.  He suggested they only made him stronger.  I was just trying to ensure I had room to live.
--
S> You've got more than enough, and this wasn't urgent at the time anyway. Get that soldier out to friendly lands!]
;W[bh];B[jc]LB[hf:A]C[After ward it seemed to me it might have been better to have tried to play some forcing moves around e5,g5or6,h5or6 so that there would at least have been something  to run to down there, before turning back to the top, especially considering how this played out.
--
S> Well, the main problem I see is that black tries to live first and run second -- that's backward. If you try to live first, you help your enemy build walls that will keep you from linking up. But if you try to run, you allow yourself -- even if you can't link up -- to push out some space that can then become eyes. So in this case, even though preventing white from linking up is important (it would have been automatic if the invasion were on the third line), running at A is much more urgent.]
;W[jd];B[ic];W[kd];B[gc];W[ib]C[S> Fortunately for black, white makes the same mistake -- she tries to kill first, and contain second. Also backward. (More on this when we get to the lower right corner.)]
;B[hb];W[jb];B[fb];W[fd];B[eb];W[db];B[ga];W[id]C[S> Read the next comment before viewing this variation.]

(;B[hc]LB[ea:B][he:A]C[S> This is a completely useless move. (I don't mean to be harsh, but I want to make it clear that it's actually a mistake, not just a suboptimal move. Suppose white plays next at A. Black has no choice but to live at B with two points. White, meanwhile, has completely neutralized this group's influence, and has built a very nice outer wall for herself (while also solidifying her groups on top and in the corner). This is unacceptable, so black needs to run. Look at it this way -- even if white captures those two stones, black can immediately capture the lone white stone, so there's no danger whatsoever. Meanwhile, white gets to proceed with her plans. Learning to seize the initiative can be crucial, especially in close-to-captured groups like this one.]
;W[ea];B[he]C[S> Again, white hands black a favor by playing the more short-sighted move.]
;W[ff];B[if]LB[hg:A]C[S> There's no time for this. Jump out to A and deal with attempted cuts later.]
;W[kf]
(;B[hg]LB[he:A][if:B][hh:C][ih:D]C[I probably should have played a one point jump to j12 here instead.  It would have been completely secure and more efficient.
--
S> Because you made the slower, safer A-B move, you can safely leap out to C here. D is also safe. See the variation.]
;W[gf];B[jg];W[lh];B[kg];W[lg];B[fh]LB[ii:A]C[S> A is better here. The more forcing moves you give to your opponent, the better the odds that she'll kill.]
;W[ih];B[jh];W[hi];B[hh];W[ii]
(;B[ig]TR[jg][kg][jh]C[S> Is this really a cut you need to protect? Suppose you could link to the bottom left by sacrificing the three marked stones? See variation.]
;W[ei];B[eg]LB[ki:A]C[S> This does nothing. A is black's best hope now.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[gi]LB[ki:A]C[S> Fortunately for black, white doesn;t realize how unnecessary this move is. Had she played at A, black would almost certainly die.]
;B[ki];W[li];B[kj];W[lk];B[kk];W[ll];B[ik];W[ji];B[kh];W[fk]
;B[jm];W[kl];B[jl];W[jj];B[jk];W[ln];B[gm]C[S> Good move. There should be enough space there to make a second eye.]
;W[em];B[en];W[fm];B[gn];W[fn];B[hl];W[eo]LB[in:A]C[S> How important is that one stone? I would play at A to guarantee that second eye.]
;B[dn];W[cl];B[dl];W[dm];B[cm];W[bl];B[bm];W[bj];B[cj];W[ai]
;B[bk];W[ak];B[ck];W[aj];B[al];W[ah]C[S> Well handled. You could have fought the ko if you wanted, but this is sente, so there's no real loss.]
;B[pi]C[S> And you use the sente well.];W[qn]C[I am curious whether this stone is killable or not.  I may have been better off just to take away it's base and let it run to the white wall to the left.   I assumed I could kill.  It seems in actually playing it out we both made a big mistake so it seems the groups status was about right as live but maybe I could have taken a different tack.
--
S> Alas, the question "Can this stone be killed?" is the wrong question. Whenever you're in a situation like this, it's best not to ask "Can I kill it?" because you'll almost always convince yourself that you can, and go on to pin all of your hopes on such a kill. If you can't kill it, then, you're up a creek without a paddle.
--
S> Thus, when you're in this situation, you should follow these steps: (1) Don't panic. (2) Seal off all escape routes. (3) Attack eye space and make sure the enemy doesn't capture anything. (4) When possible, don't give the enemy forcing moves.
--
S> This way, even if you don't kill the invaders, you can at least neutralize their impact and maybe even profit from the invasion.]
;B[om]C[S> Good first move.];W[ql];B[pl]LB[pk:A]C[S> Also good. It may be better to get this first at A. (Leaving single stones lying around is a good way to invite forcing moves.)]
;W[on];B[nn];W[pm]C[S> Excellent use of a forcing move by white.]

(;B[si]C[stupid mistake.  I knew I had to play t8 but I got excited and just responded here by rote. variation just shows how to kill white here.
--
S> Yes, that's correct. (You don't need to include those sorts of variations for GTL submissions -- I can tell how it would play out.)]

;W[hq];B[gq];W[ip];B[ho];W[jn];B[im]LB[lj:B][gp:A]C[I'm also curious if I missed anything in the development of the situation here with this large eyeless clump of white stones that develop around k5 stones.
--
S> Well, the cut at A is pretty painful for black. (This would have been avoided if the big black dragon had lived before jumping down to the bottom.) The push at B is probably black's biggest opportunity now. See variations.]

S> Part of the reason white was able to make such solid territory is that black was on the run for so long. Keep your options open as long as you can (especially when trying to link up) and you'll be surprised how much free time you suddenly have for attacking and enlaring your territory.
