C[Thank you for reviewing my game! I played it on IGS.

It is one of my first serious games ever, so I would like to have just some annotations what my biggest faults are (there are probably too much to name them individually) and what I have to improve first.
Thank you very much!];B[pp]C[Unfortunately, I don't know what colour you play.
-> i will comment in a general way.];W[dd];B[cp];W[pc];B[jd]
C[I often wonder how to respond to such a move...
In general i have only a vague idea how to play the opening.

First, this is odd, from black to play like that.
I guess he should play on his side.];W[qk]LB[qe:a]C[But since white is on the 4-3 point, he has to play on the 5-3 letter 'a'. This is the natural next move for white and prevents from a strong attack of black.
But if he still wants to play on middle edge, this should not be so clsoe to black's corner.]
;B[ip];W[dj]LB[lc:a]C[white shoul attack that black stone: a ?]
;B[gd];W[fc];B[gc];W[lc];B[kd]LB[df:a]C[the good white move (this was yet the case two moves ago) is 'a'.
You have to protect that since black comes to attack your corner.

Instead, white strengtens black's position.];W[kc];B[jc];W[ff]
C[at least ! ;)
this should perhaps be closer to the hoshi.];B[gf];W[md];B[dl]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[ck];B[ql];W[bm]LB[pk:a][ok:b][oj:c]C[haow :(
White _has_ to answer the black move:
a 2 line stone is far less importnat to a 3rd ones, especially in that configuration, where there is so much space left !
The good asnwer is someting like 'a' 'b' or 'c'.];B[cn];W[bl]
;B[qe]C[there we are:  white forgot that in the begining, remember.
And as we said just before, here (upper right side ) is the place where to play now.]
;W[mq]C[My idea was just to build a living group somehow to reduce my opponents territory.

comment:
This _is_ a good idea. Yep.
And also my goal for the year to come: be able to succeed in such invasions ;)

But before you think of invading, you have to strenghten your own position, especially on the left hand side, where the game is still to be played.]
;B[lq];W[oq]LB[mp:a][qq:b]C[correct answer is 'a' where you will escape towards the middle, or 'b' where you will try to live, stelling as much territory.]
;B[pq];W[or];B[pr];W[mp];B[mo];W[lp];B[kq];W[no];B[lo];W[nn]
;B[pn];W[nl]C[... cause as you can see now, black has been able to build influence on the left, and teritory on the right will hunting you.]
;B[qi];W[qd]C[goog local move.];B[oe];W[mf]C[another good one.]
;B[op]C[black steels the white eye but should have answered to white's move.
well, i guess it was totally sente :) ...];W[np];B[mr];W[nr]
;B[lr]C[totally usefull moves: what are they for ?
Will upper left side is still waiting for   - black consolidation
 - white attack];W[fe];B[kf];W[gj]C[ok, but ...];B[gl]C[... but it allows black to build a huge moyo (for that date of the game)]
;W[mm];B[lm];W[ge];B[he];W[hf];B[ie];W[gg];B[lj]C[the bottom white "group" is in danger now !]
;W[ll];B[km];W[kl];B[jl]C[unfortunately, white goes on building blacks moyo :(
He should escape straight away tothe north.];W[jj];B[jh];W[ki]
;B[oi];W[pj];B[qj];W[pl];B[rk];W[pk];B[rl];W[pi];B[ph];W[el]
C[argh! white cut the black tobi and doesn't go on cutting?
why?];B[em];W[dk];B[dm];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek];B[fq]C[to much space for black there (bottom right corner and side.)
But black's upper groups is weak, perhaps not alive yet ...]
;W[il];B[im];W[jk];B[jm];W[hl];B[hm]C[what i don't like here is that white closes black's territory whitout closing anything for himself.]
;W[ik];B[qg]C[black definitly closed the possiblitity of  cutting there.
White or black should have played there far before.];W[re];B[rf]
;W[pe];B[qf];W[rc];B[pf];W[pd];B[nf];W[od];B[nd];W[nc];B[ne]
;W[me];B[mg];W[ng];B[of];W[mh];B[lg];W[lh];B[kh];W[ni];B[og]
;W[nh];B[nj];W[oj];B[oh];W[mj]C[Well, I think I shoud have managed it to turn that into my territory, right?

you mean black group up there?
yes, it had been very weak for a long time.];B[se];W[rd];B[pm]
;W[om];B[ig];W[cf];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[bb];B[cb]
;W[bc];B[ea];W[fa];B[gb];W[if]C[argh: f18 -> black cuts and connects with a ko.]

;B[ja];W[la];B[ka];W[da]C[at last ! ;)];B[ii];W[ga];B[ha];W[hh]
;B[ji];W[nk];B[hi];W[gi];B[hj];W[hk];B[gk];W[ij]C[not a good move:
you self suppress your own liberties.];B[kj];W[kk];B[li];W[mi]
;B[mk];W[nj];B[lk];W[ml];B[ki];W[mn]C[pfiouh! there are the two eyes.]
;B[ln];W[on];B[kp];W[sd];B[sf];W[ib]C[well, wasted...];B[jb]
