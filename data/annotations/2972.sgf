C[I'm not exactly sure where I went wrong in this game.  I think it was somewhere in my joseki though.  Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

*I played black.


>>>Hello, 
I pointed out specific points at the appropriate points in the game.  I prefaced my comments (I may have forgotten once or twice :-))  with >>> to indicate that it was written by me.  In general, the two points I feel like you might want to work on are invading, and tenuki.  You often engaged in squabbles over just a few points when there were many more worthwhile places to play.  Also, in this game, white was wide open to invasion and you didn't utilize this fully.  That said, I think that with a few adjustments you could very easily be much stronger.  It was mainly a strategic issue and not a tactical one in this game.  Your tactics seem to be strong.  Just be sure to constantly look for big points.]
;B[jj]C[^_^];W[pd];B[dp];W[pq]C[Can you show some possible variations for this joseki (marked stone), I never know how to respond to that, and how it plays out.

>>> Heh, well maybe it's my computer but I can't see any marked stone. :-)]
;B[dd];W[qk];B[cj];W[jc];B[nc]LB[fq:A][jq:B]C[A or B probably would have been a better choice.  Where would you have played?

>>>I would probably have played B];W[ne];B[qc]C[>>> Here it would probably have been better to play M16.  that move weakens the stone at K17 and strengthens the O17 stone at the same time.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[qe];B[pb];W[ob];B[pa]LB[qb:A]C[This was dead after I made that move right?  I think I was supposed to play A

;W[sf];B[rd];W[fc]LB[db:A][jq:B]C[Would A have been a better choice here?  or maybe B to even things out a bit.

>>>B is very big but your move wasn't too bad];B[cf];W[db];B[fq]
;W[iq];B[jl]C[Too small

>>>Exactly];W[gf];B[cm]LB[jd:A][lq:B]C[Could an attack on A around now be a good idea?  I really need some influence on the top.  Maybe B also?

>>> At this point, white's territory is very large but very weak, while yours is small but strong.  At this point, it is time to invade heavily.  B is an excellent move for that purpose.  Invade lightly and tenuki often.  After ravaging the bottom and the bottom right, go for the top if you're still behind.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[df];B[de];W[ee];B[ef]C[>>>D12 would be better, or tenuki and invade.]

>>>I think maybe E10 might be better.  Try not to let your opponent flatten you like this.]

(;W[dq]C[>>>See comments on next move for info about this variation tree.]
;B[bq]LB[eq:A]C[A probably would have been better route, force him to live small in the corner.  Dont know what I was thinking.

>>> Actually white's last move was a mistake.  The variations on move 66 show the standard way of living (with a ko) in this case for white, while the variations on move69 show what you could have done.]
