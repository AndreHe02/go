C[GP: Hi, I'm Graham Philips (topazg) a British 1k and KGS 1d. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can, and I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf. I haven't commented much on the yose, despite how close the game was, because I feel more important material happened in the fuseki and early middlegame.

Where I'm offering or annotating variations that deviate from the game, I mark the game move with a square and the deviation with a triangle.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ed]TR[fq]SQ[cd]
(;B[cd]C[GP: Directionally, Black isn't playing globally with regards to his two star point stones on the right. When you play star points, you are looking to develop high and fast across the two adjacent edges, and you want to play josekis that don't give White too much outside influence, which negates much of the fighting power of the star point stones. Here I would approach at F3, and if possible lightly jump back to K4, creating a large framework on the lower side. White cannot afford the slow move of C16 himself yet, even though it is big, because it gives Black the opportunity to develop along the topside as well. When Black does play in the top left, he can now look to minimise the developing potential of the D4 stone by playing the simple joseki from C15 (see variation).]

(;B[ee];W[fd];B[gc];W[gd];B[de]C[P: I've already seen that h17 was the joseki, but during the game it was too dificult for me to calculate if I could make the left group to live

GP: My understanding is that joseki is not to play the atari at E15, but it's a complicated line (see variation at 17)]
;W[hc];B[cn]C[P: I dont know well if this is the best way to play in this situation paying attention to the situation of my little wall and the d14 stone.

Even if my wall were stronger, like in the variation, I dont know wich is the best move

GP: My personal feeling is that your wall has too many weaknesses. If your wall was as in the variation, I'd be reasonably happy playing this move, as it is, I'd play E14 (my choice) or C14 to settle your wall properly. There's a lot of bad aji remaining in the D14 stone, and you don't like quite well equipped to fight this way yet. The rules of thickness are that they are only truly effective when they don't have any weaknesses or bad aji. You don't have bad weaknesses, but White can easily treat D14 lightly and use it to either escape or powerfully reduce later. If Black gets E14, White has a hard time of handling this approach (if wF3 bD10 now, imagine the difference on the right hand side if Black had a stone at E14).]

p: I think he has played too far from d14 and I should separate his stones

GP: I agree, but you split the wrong ones. For me, Black E6 is the only move here, as White must urgently defend his corner, allowing you to pincer here more severely (see variation).]
(;W[fk]C[GP: White let you off here a bit - D6 feels a lot more severe.]
;B[fi]C[P: I prefer to make moyo, most of all thinking that d15 group can be killed

GP: This is probably coorect, but if so it shows you have had to concede that C6 was too early. Your D15 group needed to have less worries first.]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[fe];B[ef];W[eg];B[ff]TR[dn]SQ[co]C[GP: White's last 3 moves have greatly strengthened Black's position, making his D9 group more vulnerable. White must play D6 now, as Black's previous sequence no longer works because of F9]
(;W[co];B[en]C[GP: Good choice :)];W[fp];B[gn]C[GP: Your choice to jump rather than extend serves you well, as White must now fear Black playing H4.]

;W[em];B[el];W[fm];B[dl];W[fl];B[fn]C[GP: Too heavy. wE9 feels awkward (sente as you have to connect underneath), and suddenly White is attacking your middle three stones strongly. You can sacrifice E6, and treat G6 lightly - taking E9 yourself now feels urgent.]
;W[ck]C[GP: Suicidal move!];B[ek];W[ej];B[dj];W[fj];B[bk]C[GP: Very good. Capture as solidly and firmly as possible.]
;W[hm]C[P: Now I see he has lost the game. All IÂ´ve got to do is maje g6 alive, using f7 group's weakness

GP: I'm not sure if you want to do that. Unless you kill F7, keeping E6 alive isn't worth that much. I'd prefer to play K4 and develop the rest of the board as quickly as you can. Don't let White take the initiative back. The last thing you want is to run out with G6 and end up with a heavy unsettled group.]

GP: Black has no real need to make the corner so complicated. wR3 now hurts. Simply play P4 and completely cut off the O4 stone from ever hoping to connect to Q6, and 3-3 is unavailable to White (he'll either lose Q6 in a big way, or R3 in a big way as you can keep them apart).]

GP: Nothing wrong with that at all. G15 is just a stone and very sacrificable.]
;W[gb];B[pf]C[P: I prefer to make this side more solid before trying to invade the top

GP: Good, this is an excellent choice of move. R9 is still quite a distance away, if White can easily live in the lower right (which he can ), then wR12 is a bit concerning for Black.]
;W[gf];B[gg];W[he]C[***

P: What I was telling before

GP: Yeah. However, I think the atari at a G13 was quite a crucial mistake, simply because you had to go back and patch up with F13. It's better just to play F13 directly - for one thing, you can potentially rescue G15 yourself if White tenukis - If White captures, you get sente, which at this point of the game is huge.]
;B[fg];W[ne]C[GP: This is painful for Black. Getting gote out of G15 hurt!]
;B[pi]C[P: I still see that is soon to invade, I prefer to make territory in the right.

GP: R12 is safer than this and more standard shape (It's the weak point of Q16+Q14, and a two point jump from R9), and is only worth about 2 less points, so it's going to remove more of the bad aji in the corner.]
;W[rd]TR[ob][qd]SQ[qc]
(;B[qc]C[GP: This move seems too soft - it doesn't achieve anything strongly enough. Either force White to make a hard decision with R16, and hane on the opposite side to where he extends (It's hard for White to make life in the corner (see variation), and easy for you), or alternatively threaten to invade straight away with P18 (see other variation).]
;W[qg]C[P: This is a very good move I think. Now I see that is difficult to keep the territory in the left and invade or reduce in the top. I have to fight trying to get thickness to invade the top, or to kill in the right. If I play q13 I will loose both right and top]
;B[qf]C[GP: White can connect so easily at S14 that this doesn't feel good enough. I would attach straight away at S15 if you want the corner, and P13 if you are concerned about the Q11 stones.]

GP: It feels too deep, but not entirely unplayable. I would reduce with J14 probably - you can't have everything. However, you can play N17 as well - there's some useful extra aji but getting that move in sente - I'd probably choose to play it first (see variation).]

Direction of Play: Back in move 5 was a very important point regarding the direction of play, and the purpose of star point stones. It's a very complicated topic area generally, and is outstandingly well covered in the book "The direction of play", but having a consistent opening is a vital part of Go. If you are playing star point stones, you are designing a game around influence, thickness and moyo/framework building. Just because a 5-4 stone looks immediately intimidating doesn't mean that jumping in the corner is the right response. If you give outside thickness to White, you start hurting your star point stones.

Thickness: It's well known that you use thickness for attacking, not for enclosing territory. However, thickness is not truly thick if it has internal defects or a lot of remaining bad aji. If it isn't truly thick, it risks being a lot of inefficiently placed stones. In the game, the D14 stone sat squarely facing down the left hand side with good escaping chances, and risked negating a lot of the value of the wall. As a result, firmly cutting it off from being useful (White can never afford to extend after you bend around the top as he will become unbearably heavy) is often necessary to turn "lots of stones" into actual thickness.

Pincers: The comments and variations around move 25 are vitally important. In many ways, you missed the true value of your thickness by not taking E6 at this move - even though it feels like the thickness should help the upper side of that edge not the corner approach, it is precisely that thickness that lets you follow up E6 severely _either against the upper left edge or the corner_.

The value of saving stones: Your comment on 54 was a telling example of your desire to look after stones and groups that are unimportant. At this point you stated your goal was to save them using White's weaknesses, without asking yourself why you'd want to save them (worth perhaps 10 points to you at the time) anyway. Fortunately, White forced you to gain excellent profit on the lower edge, but in reality the answer for those stones was to develop the lower edge in sente (using the fact you could save the stones to force White to respond to your development at the bottom). Unless you were aiming at killing White's middle group outright at that point, saving those stones was not important enough. Cutting stones are normally important, but normally because they create at least one weak opponent group on either side. If White is strong on both sides, they have no value other than the 2 points per stone that prisoners are worth.

Also, Move 174 was a good example of saving stones that weren't valuable enough to be worth saving at that point. It wasn't small (~10 points or so), but the reduction at the top was much bigger. It's worth remember that everytime you save stones, you normally do so in gote - playing somewhere else and allowing them to die normally lets you follow up your tenuki _as well_, so it can often be surprisingly non-profitable to spend a gote move saving a few of your own stones or capturing your opponent's.

*** To take to your next few games ***

If you like playing 4-4 openings, try to deal with other corners in ways that don't lead to joseki giving your opponent thickness facing your hoshi stones. Simply "following joseki" is not enough - understanding why you have chosen a particularly joseki is vital - a locally equal result can be a globally very bad result depending on what has happened elsewhere.

Before saving stones just because you can (even when they are in groups of 4 or 5), ask yourself what they give your global position other than just being alive stones. If they disconnect important enemy groups, they are valuable. If you can save them in sente, they are valuable. If losing them gives your opponent a lot of territory when he cuts them off, they are valuable. If they achieve none of these, saving them is probably not worth it until mid to late endgame.

I hope these comments are in some way helpful. If you have any responses / queries / comments or would like further input on specific moves or areas, do feel free to ask!]
