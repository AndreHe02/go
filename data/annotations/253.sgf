KM[5.5];B[dd];W[pq];B[dq];W[qd];B[co];W[oc];B[qo];W[po]C[This seems unusual. I played  it to play toward the bottom, but with his shimari there too, maybe this is  poor strategy.

Comment: I think this is ok.];B[qp];W[pp];B[qq]C[Comment: Maybe Black should play r7 instead of r3.]
;W[qn];B[lq]C[I thought he needed to reply to protect his corner first.]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[pr];B[rs];W[ro]C[This seems to  kill it.

Comment: Corner is not that big. Black can afford to let it go.  But, in that  case, it is better not to play s1.  Now Black has much less aji.]
;B[iq]L[ip]C[Comment: better to play on 4th line (j4) I think.];W[cj]
;B[jc];W[qi]C[Comment: If I were White, I would play c14  right away];B
[pf]C[This doesn't seem normaly.  I thought C8 looked  real good for him.

Comment: Yes, Q14 is premature. Also, if Black wants to erase white's  territory, better to play p11.]
;W[nf]C[Comment: Black should tenuki.  If he fights to save this stone and white builds up outside strength, White  can launch a heavy attack on k17 or build a big moyo in the center]

;B[le];W[lf];B[me];W[ne];B[qh];W[rf]C[THis looks wrong now. Any suggestions?

Comment: White should capture with p12.];B[mi];W[cf];B[ce];W[df];B[fc];W
[cm]C[These last couple of points  should have been blacks, I think.];B
[lc]C[Comment: Small];W[mc]C[Comment: N17 is too small. Capturing the p11  is still important since the  black group is not alive yet.]
;B[nj];W[nk];B[nh];W[mk]C[Comment: Now Black is stable. N9 looks good but there is bad aji  with the cut at p9. Maybe black can still do something with his "dead"  corner.]
;B[rg];W[ri]C[Comment: Black helps white solidify weak  position while gaining nothing.]
;B[re];W[rd];B[qf]C[Comment: this is too small.];W[hp]C[Comment: good move]
;B[ip];W[ho];B[io];W[hn];B[mn];W[in];B[jn];W[jm];B[kn];W[cc]C[This is supposed to live, but with  F17, I bet not.  I do know he errored to let me live.  I realized I was  killable after 3 moves.]
;B[cd];W[db];B[bc];W[bb];B[dc];W[cb];B[bd];W[fb];B[eb];W[ea];B[gb]C[I thought just connecting would be enough to kill me.  But  perhaps not.  I don't know where he let me go then.  Perhaps the closeness of  C14 lets me get away with this invasion.

Comment: White should not be able to live.
Black just connects, then if White tries to
make extra eye extending up the side, Black calmly extends and then has A18  or J19.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[ab];B[ed];W[eb];B[hd]C[Comment: This is unsupportable for Black:
white invasion succeeds and white gets sente.
Black is now way behind.];W[eo]L[dn][en]C[Comment: this looks like an overplay.  Black can d6 later on. A diagonal or knight's move is more solid]

[ej]C[Comment: G13 is too timid. What about C12?
Or E10 (because of white weakness at d6)?];W[eh];B[bf];W[bg];B[gi]C[Comment: Black should followup b14 with  a13]
;W[fj];B[fi];W[ei];B[gj];W[gk];B[fk];W[ej];B[hk];W[gl]C[Comment: Black is just  filling in dame while helping white solidify his territory]
