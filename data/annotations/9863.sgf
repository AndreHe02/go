;B[pd]C[Hello dear reviewer,

***Hi, I'm EdIV i'm a kgs 1k. Your game was going smoothly until you needlessly started a disadvantageous fight and ended up with a couple of weak groups. 
You seem to play quite well for a 15k, so you should get better soon. I added some variations on the chinese fuseki here, trying to explain your questions about pincers


In this game I am black and experiment with "late pincers" a bit, in situations where it's probably not appropriate. (i.e. backing off from a 4-4 stone but pincering or attatching when the opponent plays a keima into the corner)
The things I'm most curious about are when they are actually played as opposed to real pincers. 

****Usually for 1(or2) of 2 reasons: either you want to prevent the double approach or you 
pulled back and tenuki'd and later you decide that you want to pincer

Also I find my knowledge of when to play a pincer is not that solid. Surely if the resulting wall gives you potential, it's good. What if it's aimed at destroying your opponent's potential? What role in that consideration play the opponents option not to take the corner?

****It's all about what's biggest. Take the biggest side, doesn't really matter if it's the opponents or yours. If you can ruin more points than gain, then ruin you must. If you can build more than you can ruin, then build you must. Pincers are just you saying one side is bigger.


I'm furthermore curious what the best way to attack white's center group would be and where the best invasion point on the bottom formation is. Some of the game was decided by life and death, somethign I'm reasonable in when solving problems but really awfull in real games. Appart from rules of thumb and pointing out common shapes worth memorizing please don't focus on that part too much, even if many of my variations are about that.

In any case my variations only indicate what general outcome I'm expecting from some deviation. Please try to tell me as often as possible, whenever there is a choice of viable moves, what the expected result would be.

Thank you very much for reviewing this game.]
(;W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qn];W[np]C[the high move is perfectly playable, it's not that common in this situation though. Since it ends in gote, giving Black a chance to develop fast.]

(;B[rp];W[qq];B[qk];W[jp];B[cn]C[good move, Black is developing all around the board]

(;W[cl]LB[cq:A][dq:B]TR[jp]C[good move for 2 reasons:
1. it prevents black from getting "control" of 2/3 of the board (see variation)
2. it has a nice follow up since he has the triangled stone (see variation after B a, W b)]
;B[cq]
(;W[cp]C[big mistake];B[dq]
(;W[eq]C[overplay by white. I choose one of the ways to punish, but maybe it's the wrong way, since white cold build his bottom this way, he went full-overplay variation though.]
;B[bq]C[Good!]
(;W[bp];B[ep]C[this is as far as I know this pseudo-joseki. Supposedly it's really good for me.

*******
Not supposedly, this could lead to a game over situation is White's not careful]
;W[dn]C[now the question is how much black can ask for. In the game I chose the safe option of capturing white's cutting stone. Is there a way to get more?]
;B[fq]C[taking the stone is honte(proper). This result is verrry good for black]
;W[er];B[fr];W[eo];B[fp]TR[fq][fr]C[if we compare to the joseki, black gained a wall]
;W[cf]C[now I'm really unsure what to do here. arguably white is low on the left side, so just backing off might be an option.

When confronted with the question of a pincer, the question is always: Which side is bigger? Doesn't really matter whose side it is. If you can destroy more points on one side than you can gain on the other, you should pick that side.]

(;B[fc]C[Backing off is good];W[bd]C[now I was suddenly afraid of white getting a good shape after w d12 or d11, so I tired something fancy... probably a really poor choice, but I really don't know how to reduce the mentioned shape.]

(;B[cg]TR[cl]C[oh don't play this :-P, this is dan-level. It's one of those new korean fighting joseki's.

Also,White is strong on this side , so it's not benificial to start a fight here.]

He has some cutting aji so a pincer variation would require a lot of careful reading


This move has an added benefit, you can no longer cut at c15]

(;B[ic]C[I secure my stones.]
(;W[fb]C[white has a big corner but this helps my shape I think.]

(;B[gc];W[nc]C[white shouldn't tenuki here I think. Now I try to get thickness to severely attack white's tail.]

(;B[pf];W[pb];B[lc]C[this is probably wrong again though. Same idea as before, I'm not really sure when these two joseki (backing off and pincering then or attaching) are appropriate and preferable to pincering right away.]

;B[md];W[lb]C[seems slow, but I respond anyway, since it helps my shape.]

;W[kb]C[now this seems really slow, so I tenuki.
******
moves like these should be losing moves]
(;B[dc]C[hmmm, I don't like this move. 
It shortens your liberties, loses ko threats, doesn't help with the cut...]
;W[db];B[ce]C[here is where I start the fun. I'm hoping to attack white severely, make him live in the centre while I get really big compensation on the right side and completely secure my top group which still has many defects and my left group which is still not alive.]
;W[ee]C[I make a bamboo joint to avoid being cut, but I think something like g15 or g16 is better, since white can't cut, and this way my shape is bad.]
;B[fd]
(;W[fj]C[********
I don't like this move, it's too direct, black can just go out]

(;B[ff]C[this move is probably bad, but I felt like it would make it harder for white to make eye shape and it's the only way to use that white defect that I can see. White should probably sacrifice those three stones and keep running here.

*****
he probably should yes]
(;W[ef]
(;B[fk]C[now I'm trying to save my weak group white keeping white weak.]
;W[gj];B[hl];W[hk];B[gk]C[bad move I think. Just making a diagonal connection is safer. This shape here comes back to bite me later in the game.]
;W[ik];B[hi]C[another peep that's maybe not very good.

*****
This peep is ok];W[hj];B[il]
(;W[hg]C[good move by white making shape. Not sure if my h11 exchange was good or bad here.

******
I don't like this move];B[ji];W[gh]C[white is trying to make an eye. I think he should try running first. However I choose to poke the eye, which is probably bad. Instead I think I should secure my two floating centre stones at the same time preventing white from connecting to the bottom.]
;B[gi]C[yeah the poke is bad];W[fi]C[white should not respond here, because I'm threatening to cut his group in two. The exchange is probably bad for me, because after black d12, black e12 is no longer threatened. Nevertheless, black only has one eye over there, which in the game I misread. I thought the atari that I played next gave me the option to live by playing first, but it doesn't.]
;B[aj];W[al];B[hh];W[ig]C[now comes a terrible blunder by me. The correct move is probably bamboo joint. I however sacrificed those stones giving white instant life. I'm really unsure how much this attack should profit me, if I had played the bamboo joint. White is ahead on territory.]

(;B[li];W[ii];B[jh];W[ih]LB[lq:A]C[playing the peep already was wrong too, since it's wasting a ko threat and doesn't really improve my shape.

******
You can still invade at A, it should make the white group stones weak, giving you a high probability of getting sente]
;B[nl]C[I decide to build the right side anyway, this move however is probably a lot smaller than I think. maybe even sealing off the top right is bigger than this.]
;W[rf]C[not sure how to react here.]

(;W[rg];B[rh]C[white should have jumped I think.];W[mk]C[not sure about this part.

;B[lq]
(;W[lp]C[Not sure if this is the correct invasion, only thing I'm sure if is that I misplayed it pretty hard.]

(;B[kq]C[maybe the other direction is better, see variation, which has occured in a pro game.]

this is fine];W[hq]C[white prevents me from connecting up.]

p1 is always bad, connection at o2 or hanging connection at o1 are the moves

How can this be great for white ?? :-D he has a weak group at the top, which you can attack for points and center power and he has weaknesses at A and B. Also on points i think you're doing fine too. 

I added two variations how you might reduce the left and the bottom after you're done attacking the top right. There are of course many variations depending on how the board develops, the ones i show might not be the best ones, they are just to illustrate the weaknesses in White's shape]
