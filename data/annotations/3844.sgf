C[Reviewer,

Thank you for taking time to review my game, it was a very unusual game for me. I played a very different opening.. Please tell me what you think about the opening moves if you would.. I'm curious if my focus is on the right parts of the board at any given time. I added some variations, just as an exploration of other possible lines that I thought might come up.

Again, thank you for your time, I appreciate all of the comments you have for me.]

(;B[nc]LB[dc:X][nc:X][oc:X][pj:X][pn:X][cp:B][cq:A]C[At this stage its too early for there to be a definitive "best move"  however any of the points marked X looks reasonable.
If you want to take advantage of white's tenuki after c6 then A is probably a better move than B. (see comment on the variation).]
;W[do]LB[bp:A][cp:B]C[This white move is off target since (when the time is right)  black can slip under or peep at A or B. White should play B himself]
;B[em]LB[pj:A]C[An unusual move. Black should be itching to play around A ( to build on the shimari he just made in the corner. If black isn't going to play A right now he needs to make a move that white must answer.]
;W[pj]C[Disaster for black.  White gets the big point.];B[qh]
C[See how much smaller black's moyo is now.];W[pm]LB[dc:B][hc:C]
[nj:A]C[Inefficient. If  White wants to paly around here then  A  is the point It defends against invasion and makes the moyo bigger at the same time. Other big points for white are at B or in the area of C]
;B[dc]C[Good.];W[dj];B[ch]LB[ei:C][fi:B][fj:A]C[Better to come at the white stone from above and buiild a big moyo with A,B or C. Let white make a small group on the side mand build a much bigger moyo yourself]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[en];B[dl];W[fn];B[ek]LB[ei:B][fi:A]C[does this move seem good for this situation? I thought F8 would not be good to leave a peep at E9 for white..

No - still better to confine white with  A or B this move encourages white to run into black's area.]
;W[co];B[cm];W[jo];B[id]LB[ei:A][fi:B][jl:C]C[half way from each side, a bit of a stretch I imagine, is this an ok extension?

this is fine from that point of view  but I still think A or B are better.  (because they attack white)  You could also have come in around C somewhere - reducing white's moyo and expanding your own.]
;W[kd];B[jc];W[kc];B[rj]LB[kf:A][jm:C][qq:B]TR[if]C[I wanted a  little more of whites moyo, i figured this couldn't be ignored, should I have just played J14 first?

You must attack the two stones with A

The triangled move is not sever enough here.
The move you actually played is an endgame play.

If you want to get at white's moyo then invade on B or reduce from the outside at C]
;W[qk]C[An odd move - black can skip past.];B[oh]LB[kf:A]TR[qf]
C[I liked this, it seems to play nicely with the long knights shimari I have, should this have been at R14?

This is defintely better than r14 (which is a feeble and inefficient move.

BUT  you should be attacking the two white stones with A. You just can't leave heavy stones sitting around like this.]
;W[kf]C[See - white played there

My opponent's best move is my best move.];B[kh]C[I thought with a bit of fighting in the middle that I was ahead by enough and with R3 still open for a last minute invasion, I figured I would just spring into action and put pressure on white

;B[hl]LB[ih:B][jl:A]C[Either try and cut him off with A or defend your moyo with B]

[gk][hk][bl][cl]C[Overall comments

You seem to be unsure of the relative importance of moves. Try to make ALL your move pressurise your opponent. Look for weak heavy groups to attack ( solid clumps of stones i confined spaces are heavy).  In particular use the capping move to confine your opponent to the side.

Don't be scared to build big moyos - you don't have to keep it all- the threat od a big moyo will force your opponent ot make a weak group.

Try to push the boundaries of moyos - expand your side and reduce your opponent.]
