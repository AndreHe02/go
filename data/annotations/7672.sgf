C[Good Morning!
I'm not very good in English, so try to understand it =))

F: Hi, 
This looks a pretty good game for you. I made some remarks here and there. I think the main point to work at is to see the strength and the weaknesss of the groups on the board and to defend or attack at the right time.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc];B[qk]
(;W[jq]C[F: Another possibility is N4/ Variation];B[fd];W[df]
C[I don't really know how to answer this. Can I tenuki here?]
;B[cn]TR[jq]C[i did not pay attention to the marked stone here...
F: This is OK, I think. Playing K16, building  a moyo is another option]
;W[fp];B[bq]C[I know this is hamete. I played it to see opponent's strength.
Black gets out not good here because white answers correctly.]
;W[cq];B[dj]C[just don't want to play in corner];W[bp];B[po]
LB[cl:A]C[Should i defend the invasion at A first.
F: Since you played a big extension, defending is necessary, on A, or maybe better on E6 or E7]
;W[mq]C[F: Big, but rather slow];B[jd]LB[jc:A]C[is A better?]
;W[qf];B[pf]C[Playing on moyo..];W[pg];B[of]
(;W[qc]LB[pc:A][qe:B]TR[jd]C[Here i think A is better than B because of marked stone.
F: Since you got a moyo with two wings, B is also possible I think.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rg]LB[og:A]TR[fb][of]C[Is A a must move?
How to play on the left side?

F: A is big for the moyo on the upperside, but weakening your positon on the right side. Maybe like in the variation on next move
Left side: E7,  C12 is also nice (maybe sente)

PS. Remarkt the position of P14 (x), which should be better on A (P13), also, your moyo is still open at F18]
(;B[co]C[Can white tenuki?

F: Play it out for yourself (variantion on next move)]
(;W[cp];B[ec]C[I think this is solid but slow and gote.
Where is the proper(im bad in english, proper=best?) move for?
F: Defending the left side is absolutely necessary];W[ch]C[Should I answer this?
F: Yes, now white is stable in this corner, this makes an invasion on the lower left side even more dangerous]
;B[jo]C[Dont think this is good move but is goes out well in the game.]
;W[ip];B[ci]C[F: Finaly!];W[qp]C[Is connect the best?
F: Normaly yes, since white has already a stone on N3, but it depends on your fighting skills.]
;B[pp];W[qm]TR[qk]C[This move was a bit scary.
I decided to leave the one stone to save the corner.
Is there better continuation
F: Interesting white move. Taking the corner is the best option, I think. Otherwise, see variation on next move]
(;B[qn]C[F: Q5 is the proper move, leaving no aji and not making white stronger]
;W[pm];B[qh]LB[ph:A]C[Is this peep? Is it better for white to play A?]
(;W[qg];B[og]TR[qh]C[building moyo ...
I think moyo is more important than kikashi stone
F: It's not only the kikashi stone, this way your killing your right side]
;W[ph];B[ok]TR[pm][qm]C[Attack on marked stones];W[rn]
(;B[qo]C[Good?]
(;W[ro]C[F: This is too slow, better counterattack. See variation]
;B[rl];W[rm]C[White has a heavy form. This what actually what i wanted]
;B[rp];W[nm];B[mo];W[ml]
(;B[om]C[F: This is overdoing things  a little.... See variation]

(;W[pk];B[pj];W[pl];B[nk];W[oj]C[F: White must connect];B[oi]
;W[qj];B[nj];W[qi];B[nl]C[F: This is very good for black, who is getting a very big center]
;W[jf]
(;B[if]C[Good or not? Or keima is better?
F: The idea is good, attacking the white stone in your moyo, but the technique is wrong: you should keep more distance. See variation]
;W[ie];B[je];W[hf];B[ig];W[he]
(;B[ff]TR[he][ie][hf]C[Again atacking

F: Now it is time to think where you want to make your territory. The wall you are making with this attack, won't be very usefull, because white is strong on the left upper side. Maybe you should try to make more of your center. See variations for some suggestions.]
;W[hg]
(;B[hh]C[Maybe nobi is better?
I jist wanted to count more

;W[gc];B[gb];W[gj];B[hk];W[dl]C[F: C8 would be more diificult for black]
;B[dh]TR[cn][co]C[giving up those stones
