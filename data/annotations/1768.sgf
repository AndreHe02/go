RE[W+10]

AB[dd][pd][pp][dp]C[J: Hello, I am a Spanish 4k and I played this game as Black. I had a good start, but I did not put my thickness to good use and later on a W group "resurrected" so I finally lost. I have put lot of commentaries, please fell free to correct them. I have put some questions too, I would be really gratefull if you would answer some of them (specially moves 44 and 88). I hope you enjoy the game.

ab: Hi, this is an interesting game. You indeed played very well in the lower center
fight, also your comments show that you understood this fight very precisely. However, a little later you lost the goal a bit, see my somewhat lenghty comment at move 88.
But certainly you can improve on that, I'd guess that you would soon need a stronger player than me to comment on your games...]
;W[dn];B[fp];W[fc];B[cf];W[qf];B[nc];W[nq];B[lq]C[J: A pincer semms called for, since it may be considered as an extension of d4-f4 stones.
arend: yes, M3 is good here.];W[qn];B[oo]C[J: o4 seems better. If next W r3 or r4, then p3.
arend: Agreed. (Although it can get complicated after BO4 - W N4, as one of my opponents showed me recently...)]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[dl]C[J: Bad.p7 was needed. And if B is going to tenuki, then firstly d10 is locally better and secondly e17, f16, k16 is best.
ab: Locally d8, d9 d10 are all possible, I would probably play d9, but that is a matter of
taste. P7 IS important.];W[lc];B[rd];W[no];B[om]C[J: Bad, p6 is better. Even o6 should be considered.]
;W[nn]C[arend: I think this is aji keshi, as it reduces black's shortage of liberty. After
Q2 - P2 - R2, Black cannot play O2 at the moment. So I think W should hane immediately.
This is also the reason why p6 would have been the best move (instead of p7).]
;B[on];W[ql]C[J: o7 seems bigger.];B[nm];W[ln]
(;B[iq]C[J: Bad. n7 is really important. B could have sacrified m3 to get a wall facing North, for example n7, l4, l8.
ab: I do not think you should surrend M3 immediately. White's group is weak as well, so you should keep your chances to attack. OTOH, N7 is a HUGE move from shape
point of view for both weak groups, so it cannot be missed. I try to give some variations.]
;W[mm]C[This is point is so important for black and white strength and eye shape. Never let your opponent play there!]
;B[nk];W[lk];B[fm]C[J: In this moment B thougth he could connect with o2 .
He almost can...];W[mi];B[nr];W[op];B[qo];W[ro];B[po];W[mr]
;B[or]C[J: B now is counting on taking r6 and cutting W in two...]
;W[mq];B[rn];W[rp];B[qm];W[rm]C[J: ...but W keeps connected.
ab: Well, only at the cost of a ko.];B[pn];W[sn];B[rl]C[J: I am nor sure about this. With B group in danger, B decides to win this ko no matter what W ko threat may be and then to kill W corner with r2, s2, s1. Is this a correct decision? What could have been played here instead of s8?
ab: Hmm, that is a tough question. The ko is definitely a very good opportunity for
Black, as W is risking a huge corner with the ko. The only question I would ask me at that point is "Can I increase my ko threats by playing somewhere else first?". However,
Black already has two wonderful ko threats at N8 and (after that one is answered) at
L7. I think s8 is good.];W[qn]C[Just note that...]
(;B[ml]
(;W[pm]C[J: Very bad. W should have answered B's threat: m8.
ab: I don't know whether white has an alternative. He has no ko threats.]
;B[ll];W[io];B[kn]C[J: Maybe l9 directly was better.];FG[];W[ko]
;B[kk];W[lj]C[J: This must be bad. What should W have done?
I agree it is bad, but I can understand W's intention. If you have a big weak black group, then you want to keep it that way at all costs... I think W should play at H3.]
;B[km]C[J: m7 instead, threating m5 cut
ab: No, that would be bad shape I think.];W[jn];B[jp]C[J: I am very fond of k4. B is planning to play j8, but this intermediate play helps B's South. Is it really good? Or am I wasting the opportunity of a future atari at j6?
ab: If k4 helps, then it is indeed excellent timing. And I think it does, otherswise W can easiliy make living shape by attacing at H3 and K3.]
;W[jo];B[il]C[J: Now it is W's South group which is in danger. W should not have taken the ko.]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[gm]C[J: Seems bad to me, you should not go to get "haned" by an already played stone like this.]
;B[gl];W[fn];B[fl]C[J: I played f8 thinking about "good shape", "solid wall" and stuff like that. Was e7 better?
ab: I would probably play e7 in the game and wish I had played f8 later :-)
Good judgment!];W[en]
(;B[cp]C[J: This takes profit while keeping the preassure on W. But it was not necessary, if W c3 then c4; if W c4 then c3 c5 b3. It was better to play j16.
ab: No, the idea of C4 is good. But you should be a bit sharper here. Play the peep at G5
first! (The peep is good, as the cut at G6 does not work.)]
;W[hq];B[gq];W[eq];B[ep];W[hr];B[hp];W[ip];B[ir];W[gr];B[fq]
;W[fr];B[er];W[jr]C[J: B hopped W k3, k2, l3, l2, l4, h1.];B[jq]
C[J: Now B wishes he had exchanged B m4 for W m5 before.];W[kq]
;B[kr]C[J: B l4 kills too, but W would play m4 in sente, making W group alive.]
;W[kp];B[js];W[ho];B[gp];W[lr]C[This is unnecessary. W has 1.5 eyes at N4 and half an eye at H6 (J7 makes an eye).
OTOH, B M2 would remove the Ko aji in sente, so W M2 might be playable.]
;B[hc]
(;W[fe]C[J: I think B has a promising position here. How did I get such a poor result? I do not know what I did wrong in the next plays.

ab: Yes, Black played very powerful. If there wasn't the ko aji at the bottom, I would consider resigning now as white. How did this turn into a loss? I think there were three things that cost you a lot of points:
2. You missed the chance to get rid of the ko aji at the bottom. Well that kind of
reading mistakes happens in games,  3. You missed to get the large sente endgame in the upper right.
1. You spent a lot of time trying to kill the large white group on the left, and you lost
many points in the course of that. The attacker should be getting territory in the
course of the attack, not giving it away! (Have you read "Lessons in the Fundamentals of
Go"? If so, you will be probably be reminded of a chapter of it now :-) (I have to reread it
often, as well!) If you haven't read it, get yourself a copy! Its splendid reading, it is very true, and we all forget its lessons much too frequently! :-) )

So, always ask yourself, "How can I gain from attacking this group?" Well, if you believe you can kill it, then try to read that out very carefully. Ok, if you are then very sure that you
can kill, then you can go ahead and play moves like C13 in the game that risk a lot in the
course of the attack. But remember, most groups do not die! And remember the lesson if
it does not work :-)
If you are more careful about that, and then try to be somewhat more severe in
shape/running fights as in the lower centre, and later in the upper centre, you will soon
turn such a game into a 30 pt victory!];B[he];W[fg];B[dh];W[hg]
;B[kd];W[fi];B[ej]C[J: I am not sure if this is necessary. I did not want to get cut here, because f8-p2 group would be in some danger. And e10 grabs some points too.
ab: There is no danger for this group. Don't forget that it has threats to connect to the other side, too, e.g. with D7... And M16 is very  importan, your group looks weak already.]
;W[ld]
(;B[kf]C[J: Better at l15
ab: M15 is a good option here to play lightly.];W[kc]C[J: Bad, what can B do after W k16?]
;B[jd];FG[];W[jc];B[ic];W[nd];B[oc];W[mf];B[le]C[J: B now wants to play k12. If answered, a B move at m12 would be alright, but I did not think W was going to answer. Was it better to omit the m15-n15 exchange? Why?
ab: W has to answer here.  This exchange is bad. The reason is that it kills all the cutting potential you have around
N15. This is important. I give a variation just to show how this potential
can get used];W[me];B[jh];W[if];B[jf];W[ie];B[id];W[je]C[J: Bad.]
;B[ig];W[hf];B[ke];W[jj];B[kj];W[ki];B[ji];W[ij];B[hh];W[gj]
;B[gi];W[jl];B[jk]C[J: I think l8 is better.];W[gh];B[hi];W[fj]
;B[hj];W[eh];B[gf];W[gg];B[ge];W[ff];B[db]C[ab: Here you are risking a lot because you think you can kill white. It is better to patiently
at D11. Either this is sente, or you will get D18 or E18 in sente afterwards, so that is very
big. Attacking is to make territory, not to kill groups!];W[di]
;B[dj];W[dg];B[ch];W[ei];B[cg]C[ab: Again, you risk plenty of points because you think you can kill. Just play C11.]
;W[ci];B[df];W[bk];B[cm];W[cn];B[bm];W[bn];B[ck];FG[];W[cj]
;B[fk]C[J: e8 is better.];W[an];B[al];W[ak];B[bl];W[bi];B[bh]
;W[ai];B[eg];W[dm];B[el];W[am];B[cl];W[ef];B[dg];W[eb]C[J: g18 seems better.
ab: Instead of E18? No, I think W e18 is fine here.];B[ed];W[fd]
;B[gb]C[J: A better move?
ab: Because of the aji at C18, I do not think you can kill white.]
;W[fb]
(;B[dc]C[J: g17does not kill either, see variation 2.];W[gc]
C[J: Now B realizes W is alive. B has not got much of his attack at h17.
ab: No: Instead you lost a lot of territory on the left and in the lower left corner,
weakened your group there, and you don't even have ko threats against the white
E11 dragon any more. The game is still good for Black, but white has caught up.]
;B[hd]C[J: Directly j18 must be better.
ab: No big difference.];W[hb];B[ib];W[ga];B[ap]C[J: BAD!!
ab: yes, better remove the ko with C2.];W[bq];B[bp];W[dr];B[dq]
;W[es];B[cr]C[J: B erroneously calculated that If B connects e3, W c2 kills both a4 and k4 B groups. It is ko, but it is a ko B can not play: if W wins the ko both B groups die.]
;W[eq];B[br]C[J: So B lives at the corner.];W[hs];B[er];W[oj]
C[ab: W should finish the ko, but he does not have the time to do that.]
;B[ds]C[ab: B should rather restart the ko with F1. This time he risks nothing.]
