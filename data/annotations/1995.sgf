AB[dp][dd][pp][pd]C[Hi!

Thanks for reviewing. I played black in this game. I tried to kill an reducing move in my centermojo, which does not work. But: What to do instead? The situation is at Move 55.   I am sure there are many other mistakes, please notice them as well.

Thanks again!

;W[cl];B[go]C[This helps white to strengthen his lower group. At A (F6) is more flexible and if white plays elsewhere a good point at B (H3) remains for Black.]
;W[hp];B[mo];W[lp];B[jj]C[This move lays ground to blacks later defeat. With a move at A (Q9) instead black takes a firm grip on the right side territory. Now it is too easy for white to establish a living group inside blacks sphere of influence. Since black has given white a lot of secure territory with the exchange of N4 for M4 white catches up a lot.]

This feels too deep. Black should play keima at L8 now. Then the white stone would be in trouble.]

;W[hl];B[fl];W[cf];B[ce]C[This is the wrong direction. Black can not hope to defend the corner and at the meantime also kill white. A move like A (F10) might give black a chance.]

;W[fe];B[gg]C[The black net is too loose. The ogeima F8 E11 has weak points and F12 is also a weak point. Playing more solid like A (G11) or even more solid like B (G10) might work.]
