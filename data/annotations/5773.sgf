C[Hi, this was the final game of a tournament we had in the Bulgarian Room in KGS. I've stripped all the user comments. Black does get a good lead at some point but it's very interesting until then. I'd be very grateful if you could point out any mistakes and missed opportunities you see for both players. Thanks -- glimz]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj]C[glimz: I'm not sure about this move by White. It presumably wants to deny Black a nice pincer+shimari-extension (which would happen if Black's komoku is approached in the usual way) while also putting something in the way of the shimari and splitting Black. But it does this at the cost of another shimari. I wouldn't be too thrilled as White.

N: i find no professional examples of this configuration, it is a bit uninspired and lacks courage.]
;B[qn];W[qg];B[jp]
(;W[dj]SQ[jp]C[glimz: Would H3 be better? This way I can (and did) come down on the third line with F3 while attacking at the same time. Feels a bit like allowing me to turn weakness into profit?

N: i think it would be better. Also the high position of the marked stone + sente for black, limits the possibilities of a white san-ren-sei.]
;B[fq]C[N: Black's construction is ideal]
(;W[jc];B[cn]C[glimz: Feels like White should have answered F3.]

(;W[fp]C[glimz: just getting out with E5 seems better to me.

N: not sure about that.];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq]
(;B[cl]C[glimz: I'm not sure about direction here. This looked like an easy and relatively safe way to settle. How could I have extracted more from the situation?

N: looks ok to me.];W[co]
(;B[bj]
(;W[go]C[glimz: Helps me fix my weak shape.

N: this is a thank you move.];B[hp]C[glimz: It's far from obvious for me what White should do now.]
;W[cf]C[N: Hard to think of something better.];B[dn]C[glimz: White wasn't cuttable, Black seemed weak, so fix something in sente (denying White good shape). It does make the lower group weaker though.

N: no, the lower group is already very strong];W[ep]LB[go:A]
[hp:B]C[N: without the A B exchange, the last move would have been very annoying for black. Now it is not much more then dame.]

(;B[db]C[glimz: Is this an OK approach to reducing White's top left? Or should I focus on something completely different?

N: seems ok]
(;W[cc]C[N: this move is wrong, white is behind on territory. I think his only chance is to create a central moyo.]

(;B[ge];W[hf];B[hd];W[id];B[hb];W[mc]C[glimz: OK, prevented the formation of a large White framework, but my group ended up pretty weak. What would be a better way to settle?]

(;B[oe]C[glimz: This move sure looks big as it stabilizes Black completely and gets good access to the outside. However Black is weak on the left and could also enclose a large chunk of territory at the bottom instead of this move..?

N: this move is defendable.];W[lq];B[jq]
(;W[op]C[N: this has to be bad, it reinforces the corner far to much.]
;B[pp]C[N: now black has a super solid shape];W[oo];B[ql]C[N: a solid move, also attacking.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[lo]C[glimz: I have the feeling that I made things too easy for White here. Any idea how to apply more pressure while keeping strength?]

(;B[ch]TR[bj][cl]C[N: this is bad shape, too many weakneses.]
;W[ed]C[N: vital point]
(;B[gc]
(;W[ec]
(;B[eb];W[bi];B[ci];W[ol]C[glimz: W seems to be aiming at center territory]
;B[pk];W[oi]C[glimz: Hmm, didn't really get good access to the center here.]

(;B[me]C[glimz: So come out here.

N: this stone doesn't work much.];W[jn];B[in];W[io]
(;B[ho];W[hn];B[im];W[jo];B[hm];W[gn];B[ip];W[fl];B[ij]C[glimz: I end up with a weak group in the center. This and subsequent moves by White are a bit soft (I think), so it gets comfortable soon. Still I would be grateful if you could point out how Black could have continued the game more steadily, without weak groups (but still taking care of White's center moyo)... Or does this look good enough?

OTOH, how should White proceed now to have better chances of winning?

N: i thing this game is already over. White has to much weaknesses to attack strongly.]

N: I think black should be at least 15 points ahead now. So no real endgame comments anymore.]
;W[jh];B[ic]C[glimz: Need to be able to live locally here as keeping an escape route would be a burden. Perhaps this senteish move should have come earlier.
