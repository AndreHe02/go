C[Hello,
This game is from a tournament in germany and i am holding black . I played as  a 1kyu.
Mainly i want to know about this game how to handle my opponent's moyo and the joseki played in the upper right- see my questions.]

(;W[fe]LB[md:A][me:B]C[1. Should i do something about my g17-group or should i leave the situation and play elsewhere?
2. When should i break through with a move at A or B?

Per: The black group is in no immedate danger since black has both N15 and D18 to secure the group. Therefore black could play either D10 or C4.  In this situation I would play N15 to connect my stones, but that is just a matter of playing style. D10 or C4 is probaly just as good.]
;B[db]C[Per: This looks small compared to N15.];W[dj];B[cp]
C[Per: Good timing];W[co];B[bo];W[do];B[cn];W[bp];B[bq];W[bn]
;B[ap];W[cm]C[which move/ strategy do you think is good for black now?

Per: White is building a moyo on the left and black on the right.
In a situation with two competing moyos you should try to expand your own and reduce your opponents.
This makes K4 the only move. (see variation)]
(;B[cc];W[cd];B[bb]C[Per: This is to slow];W[np];B[pn];W[kp]
;B[bd];W[be];B[ae];W[af];B[ad];W[cf];B[dq];W[kj]C[Per: This is last chance for black to enter white's moyo. Maybe K12 will work, but I'm not sure.]
;B[md];W[me];B[nd];W[qc];B[qd]C[Can white live in the upper right corner?

Per: No, not directly. White can use it as a threat, when playing Q12 or R12.]
;W[dn];B[fr];W[gq];B[gr];W[hq];B[mn]C[what do you think is the best way to reduce the white moyo?

Per: It is to late now.];W[kn]C[so far i can remember the game.
If you have any other comments on moves i had no questions about, please write them too.
Thank you.])
(;B[jp]C[Per: The new border between the moyo's is K10];W[jj]
C[Per: Black has several options now. C17, N15 or a move around H8]
))
(;W[md]C[where should i play now- in the upper left or elsewhere?

Per: Now I would play elsewhere. A white attack with E17 is not as  seriuos as before. Another reason not to play at the top is that white O17 prevents black from making any real territorie at the top. Making black D18 a small move right now.]
))
(;W[md]C[is it necessary to add a stone to my h17-group?

Per: It is not necessary. If white attacks with F17 you can move out with G16. (see continuation).  I would probaly play G17 anyway. It reduces the value of white's influence and protects your group at the same time.]
