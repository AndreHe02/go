g4: Hi, I am Peter Hoehe from Germany. I am only some stones strronger than you,  so please don't ake my thinking as the truth. But I will try to point out some moves and alternatives.
This was a nice game and it was fun to go thru it.
I hope you like my comments.
I precede my comments with g4, as you can see.
Have fun,

;W[pf];B[nc];W[qi]C[R11 seems over concentrated for white
usual is R10. Right?
g4: Yes it is. R10 is slightly better.]
(;B[qk]C[Is S9 good or better more cautious S8?
g4: Seems to me as a matter of taste. R9 puts more pressure on white, which is good.]
;W[qm]C[g4: This is an overplay.];B[ok]C[g4: This leaves the possibility to vonnect the white stones. I would have played Q9 or R10. It is important to split stones to leave them weak.]

C[ktomm [6k\]: where is your picture taken?]

;B[ll]C[g4: Should be at L9 for speed.];W[nq]C[g4: This is an overplay. The top right white group is not alive. It seems important for both sides toplay around O14/N15. Even if the black corner gets small, getting profit from attacking the white group seems bigger.]
;B[np];W[op];B[pp]
(;W[no]C[g4: Should be at N4, see var.];B[mp];W[oo];B[or]C[g4: Good. Compare this to the variation]
;W[rl];B[rj];W[qo];B[ql]C[g4: Why?];W[pm]C[g4: tenuki?]
(;B[rn]C[maybe s6 was not so good, s5 better?
g4: I think this is best if you want to play in this region. It secures the black group above or takes away eye space from the group below.]
;W[ro]
(;B[po];W[qn]C[g4: Good];B[rp];W[sn];B[sk]C[g4: Very small  and gote]
;W[mf]C[g4: Great move.];B[nf];W[ne];B[mg];W[lg]C[g4: Overplay. M14 or better N15.]

(;B[me];W[lf];B[oe];W[og];B[ng];W[oh];B[of];W[pg];B[qj]C[g4: Unnessecary, better leave it for ko.]
;W[pi]C[white settled]
(;B[ri]C[maybe S13 would have been better.
g4: Now white has the head in the center. He cannot be killed. Taking away eye space is far to small. Both moves are gote.
Black has to run with the black stones into the center];W[rh]

;B[kq];W[jp];B[jq];W[nr];B[qr];W[iq];B[lr];W[ip];B[lo]C[g4: Loses a ko threat. White cannot be killed. Playing moves only becaus they are sente is not always good.]
;W[ln];B[le]C[g4: Good];W[kc];B[rf]C[g4: Too small.];W[ke]C[g4: Good]
;B[de]C[g4: Very late and not easy to live wihtou giving white too much territory.]
;W[gc]
(;B[ch]C[g4: Better at C17 to establish a base, see var];W[dm]
C[g4: Better to put pessure on the two black stones. perhaps with C10.]
;B[ck]C[g4: Black has a base, this is good for him.];W[bd];B[bp]
C[seing white big moyo at bottom I looked for invasion. Is this good point?
g4: This move is normally played, when black can react different regarding whites answer. In this position, because of the white stone at D7 black seems white to allow white to stabilize his moyo.]
;W[cq]C[g4: Correct.];B[co];W[do];B[bm]C[g4: Why not C6?];W[bn]
C[g4: Just C6 is good enough. This may backfire.];B[cn];W[cm]

(;B[bk]C[g4: Better see var.];W[dn];B[bq]C[g4: Unnessecary]
;W[br]C[what are the big moves on the board now?
my idea was to reduce white moyos up and bottoms and make a moyo for black in middle.
g4: White seems to lead by 10 points. Remember to keep your opponents weak stones separated. I would prefer A8.]

C[C14 took me by surprise
g4: Forestalls the black moves at C16 follwed by B15 which would take territory with a former weak group.]

Now the game seems very close, so I would appreciate evaluation
of the yose play];W[gp];B[ho];W[hn];B[gn];W[fp];B[bg];W[bb]
;B[ig];W[if];B[bc]C[g4: Too early from Black. This is a 3 step KO. Taking big endgame moves is better.K2,  A2, N18 are bigger.]
;W[qc]C[in view of this move perhaps I had to defend earlier against it
Now the game is pretty close, so I would apprecaite evaluation of the yose play.
g4: Nothing to fear. Bear in mind, that you didn't defend S14. So you can't defend it now. At end end of these moves white gsined nothing but the stone at S14.]
