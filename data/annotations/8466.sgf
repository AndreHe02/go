AB[dp][pd][pp]C[levand [15k\]: hi, good game
Stanley: Hi, I would like to know if there any move along the game that I can make to improve my efficiency. As for some moves I feel the need to make but did not feel that it is very efficiency.
Hope you will be able to enlighten me, thank you so much.

al>Hi Stanley! I will try, but some of your questions are complicated to answer at my level. This game was fun because it is not about the most common beginner issues.

al>Well, one thing is that you both get tangled in local fights, forgetting to look at the whole board, but that happens to everybody :)

al> I will address your questions as they come, and maybe comment in other places, too.]
;W[dd];B[jd]C[StanleyLim [18k\]: hi];W[cn];B[cp]C[Should I reply C6 move in this way? I feel weird after making this move

al>Joseki is a science in itself, so feel free to get other's opinion as well.

al> This is one way of defending the corner, which I often use myself. However, considering that black have three stones on white, it feels a little slow - black has potentially three corners, and can afford to lose parts of one in exhange for a broader framework.

al> One alternative is to defend the corner by means of F2, suggesting a connection to Q4 and thus some territory along the bottom. Like I said, black does not need to be too aggressive, and if the standard joseki plays out, black will have half the corner and good potential to the lower right of it.

al> Another option is to play elsewhere, like around Q10 or K4, building a looser grid for potential territory.

al> If black wants to be aggressive, though, a pincer at C8 or maybe ac C10 would also be interesting to try.]
;W[dj];B[gc]C[al> Maybe C4 should be followed by F3 or something similar, to close the corner and stretch out towards the other corner.]
;W[fd];B[gd]C[al> Contact play makes both players stronger, locally. G16 will make  it easier for white to get a huge corner, while black has no way of making as much points along the top with the same number of stones - the top right corner and the N17 area are still quite open. I would try to build on a framework along the right and lower side instead. Black can afford having a little patience.

al> It is a good exercise to go to the end of the game and compare how many points each player gained from this exchange.]
;W[fc];B[fe];W[ee]C[al> It is the same here; black helps white to make a big moyo in the upper left.]
;B[ff];W[nq];B[lp]C[al> Black M4 is too close to the white stone, I believe, and also a little too high. The ideal for black is to threaten white and building a moyo along the bottom at the same time.

al>  With a stone at F2, black could have extended to the right, executing a loose pincer on white O3. Black could even have played P3 with more authority, in that case.

al> I can't claim that black M4 is a bad move, though. Players of different strength will probably have different answers.]
;W[qn];B[no]C[al> This move is a little too nice, I think. With P5, white would have to choose which of the R6 and O3 stone sto protect, but O5 is like a gentle attack on O3. Black P3 is an option here which would make life difficult for O3, likely resulting in a good corner or territory along the bottom for black.]
;W[lq];B[kp]C[Will it be better if I make the move on L3?

al> L3 might be a good idea here, because it will attempt to stop white from destroying black's potential territory along the bottom. BLack L3, W M2, B L2 and white will be busy defending the group while black gets stronger towards the white stone at R6.

al> Black M4 just drives white to the left as well as to the right. With the pincer I talked about earlier, the ideal would be to drive white out into the center while black gets points both in the corner as well as along the bottom.]
;W[qk]C[al> Of course, white abandoned the lower stones :)]
;B[qp]C[al> Black should take advantage of white's tenuki and threaten the lower white stones in order to secure points in the corner or to the left. This move is not a grave threat to either of white's groups.

al> I don't really like this position, but I might have played L3 to cut white's progression to the left.]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[pr];B[qr];W[op];B[oo];W[np];B[pn];W[jq];B[jp]
C[Is this move impt or I should play elsewhere like R13?

al> Black K4 drives white to the left, destroying even more of black's potential territory there. White's jump to K3 leaves a hole at L3 which black should cut in order to put a stop to white. Playing elsewhere is not an option as black will not get as many points in the center as white is getting along the bottom.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[ip];B[io];W[iq];B[ho];W[qh]
(;B[qf]C[al> Black L3 is still an option for capturing half of the white stones at the bottom.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[ol];B[qm];W[pl];B[rn];W[ql]
(;B[qo]C[al> Black S7 would force white to consider the potential monkey jump to T10 and retaining the initiative for black to play O7 to try to cash in on black's stones on top of white's bottom group. (ignoring the situation at the bottom left for the purpose of reviewing other options).]
;W[nm];B[nn];W[on];B[ln];W[lm];B[oh]C[al> Black P12 stretches out too far in an attempt (I beleive) to reduce white's chances of a moyo around P10. It provides a perfect place for white to cut and, in fact, gives white an even better chance to get that moyo.

al> With P13, black would still have reduced white as well as threaten to build a big moyo at the top, while making it harder for white to attack the stone.]
;W[pg];B[og];W[pf]
(;B[qe]C[al> The dilemma of trying to protect every group leads to situations where you lose even more. As we see later, white captures the P13 group.

al> Black P14 would grow a wall that could make for a cosiderable territory later at the top of the board, in exchange for white capturing the R14 stone and getting points along the right side.

al> Black R15 guides white into black's moyo at the same time as putting the P13 group in harms way.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[ne];B[nd];W[od];B[oc];W[oe];B[pc]C[al> Contact play results in many weaknesses - it is impossible to protect three cuts.]
;W[nc];B[md];W[me];B[mf]
(;W[mc]C[In this fight, i am quite confuse where i should play to gain an advantage,
I feel i lost in this part
can you comment on how i can make this fight better?

al> The bad situation started at #56, or even at #52, as it was a mistake to lead white into the top area. White gets the benefit of being able to make multiple threats with each stone.

al> BLack does not seem to be decided about what to protect, so it gets worse. However, white should not be able to keep the top group alive, so N17 would be better played elsewhere.]
;B[ld];W[le];B[ke];W[ng]
(;B[nh]C[al> It would be better to let the P13 group go and to focus on getting stronger on the outside, towards the center.]
;W[mg]
(;B[lg]C[al> I think L14, followed by L13 is a more solid way of sacrificing the N14 group.]
;W[lf];B[lh];W[mh];B[mi];W[ni];B[oi];W[nj];B[mj];W[oj];B[mk]
C[al> with the hole in the wall at L14, black cannot gain much by building this wall.]
;W[nk];B[kf]C[al> Fortunately, white does not see that, but Black still has two weaknesses, at L13 and M11 that white could exploit.]

(;B[ia]C[al> Black O18 instead of J19 would kill white.];W[ma]
(;B[nb];W[na]C[al> The critical point here is L19, not O19. Since white missed it, black should play there now.]
;B[oa];W[ka];B[ob];W[mb];B[km];W[mn];B[ll];W[mm];B[mo]C[al> Connecting two live groups does not accomplish much. White is slightly in the lead so black needs to do something about white's larger areas on the left (if we still ignore the need to play L3).

al> BLack could play D12, D11, E10, or D7 to try to mess with white.]

Is my choice of fighting around B11 a better option or I should have concentrated on controlling the center more?

al> There are usually a lot more points along the sides than in the center, so white is normally not able to compensate in the center for losses along the side. In this game, however, black has a considerable moyo in the center, so it is not obvious what is the best. A jump like this can steal some 10 points, and the way white responds, the whole left side is destroyed, and black also gets more points in the center than what he deserves :), so it turned out to be a good move, anyway.]

Thank you so much for the comment
I am looking forward to learning from you

al> You are welcome! It was fun, as always. Bear in mind that I am not a string player, so you might want to discuss this with other players as well. Or try to prove my advice wrong, by analysing further :)

al> To sum up, try to play lighter - not so much contact play in local fights, look at the whole board, and try to calculate how many points each player gets out of every exchange to see who got lucky. All the best in the future!]
