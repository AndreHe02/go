C[Dear Reviewer,
I am playing Black in this game, and I lost. I am puzzled by this game, since I do not know how could I prevent my loss.
The main question is related to the middle game: White has managed to create a very very moyo on the top left up to the center. I did my best to invade and reduce it, but apparently it was not enough. So my questions are:
- Did I make a mistake by allowing White to build this moyo?
- How could I invade the moyo more effectively?
Thanks!

a) Allowing white's moyo itself was no mistake.
b) You should not invade into white's strongest position.

The lesson you could learn from this game is to respect your opponent's walls. After the beginning white had a huge lead which made it hard to turn this game around.]

It is hard to catch this stone due to D10 and J6. The top right group is the only vulnerable white group.  The stone at A blocks O10 towards the top. Black has at least two invasion points so I would suggest to simply play Q8. A more aggressive option is m10.]

No. This is an invasion in white's strongest position.];W[co]

(;B[bi]C[Black manages to live; However I have doubts about last move (b11). It allowed White to strengthen his moyo with c13. I was afraid that without b11, the left group is not safe. Was I right?

I wouldn't say that they are dead but if white attacks them he will gain something. Generally playing at the second lineand inducing C13 can't be considered good.]
;W[cg];B[bo];W[bp]C[B4 too small for white.];B[md]C[Now starts the invasion to the top. Here too Black manages to live, but at the expense of giving up the top left. Should Black play otherwise?]

C[And now Black tries his best to do sonthing on the top left, but fails. Is there a better way?

This is a good try. You cannot do much here a lighter reduction doesn't work because black is around 30 points behind.]

That E7 is a better answer for white. J7 isn't an important stone. White is ca. 30 points ahead.]

- Do you agree that White leads here?
- Did Black made a severe mistake during the Yose (except last move)?

Thank a lot for your time and effort!

Yes, white leads with around 10 points.
