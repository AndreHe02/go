C[To the reviewer:

So this game I played black. I'm not quite sure why I had lost the game, I felt that I stuck to the principles, and attacked strongly, and didnt make overplays. I'd like to know where my biggest mistakes were, or if you see weakness in my style of play.

Your review is greatly appreciated.

XCM: Hi, I'm Mark (XCMeijin on KGS), and I hope my comments will be helpful to your game.]
;B[pd];W[po]C[M: 5-4 spooked me a bit, wasnt sure how to handle it. My choice of approach in this corner might have helped me lose this game.

When one plays 5-4, they are looking for centre influence, but more inclined towards the side it is leaning on (in this case, the right side).

If you're worried about 5-4, i suggest you play your next move at D4. Seeing as your upper-right stone occupies the star point, it's quite stable, so you don't need to go for a parallel double-star opening.

See variation.]
(;B[dd];W[dp];B[cn];W[ck]
(;B[en]C[M: The pincer is always confusing and usually leads to me losing games. Did I follow up correctly? why or why not?

Jumping out in response to the pincer is typical, but seeing the 5-4 stone in play, this may not be the optimum move. That's not to say it's completely wrong...

D4 is a 4-4 stone, so you could attach it from two directions at once. E6 at F4 looks good. See variation.]

(;B[pq]C[M: Is this a bad way to handle the 5-4? I had never seen it before...

XCM: Much too direct. By playing this deeply, you are letting him enclose you in the corner, and letting him build outside influence. Add that to his stones on the lower left, and that influence is already 50% territroy.

;W[jp]C[M: it seemed bad because w was thick and also had sente. Seems like w has this game already]

(;B[jc]C[M: Since w took a big gote, I thought I should too. Is this a big gote to take?

XCM: See Variation

Overall, this is a good area to play, trying to secure the entire upper side.]
;W[nc]
(;B[oc];W[nd]
(;B[pf]C[XCM: Too high. See variation.];W[qh]C[XCM: Playing too high presents this problem...]

(;B[nf]C[M: I thought I should pressure O17/16 because he abandoned them. In hindsight though, this fight might have benefited white more than black.

XCM: Pressuring is a good idea, however keep in mind that "pressure" does NOT equate to "kill". You just have to chase and chase your opponent, not necessary to kill, just make them small.

See variation.];W[le];B[je];W[kf]C[M: I thought I had a good moyo upper left, but apparently the hole at e14 is disastrous. Should b patch it up now?

XCM: Yes. I would likely G16 or G17 now.]
(;B[bl];W[hc]C[M: now the tables are turned, black is split into weak groups and w enjoys eating his territory]
;B[fc]C[M: I thought I should salvage some territory while pressuring white.

XCM: This one oversight turns the tables. Now white is pressuring you.]

;B[cl];W[dk];B[dl];W[ej]C[M: so here i read out that if i try to close him off, my stones die, so I abandoned the idea of closing him off to the idea of saving my stones]

(;B[gi];W[fk];B[bq]C[M: here I thought this was appropriate as it is a medium sized move, and secures my group.]
;W[fn];B[eq]C[M: Is there a better way to creep into the corner? I thought w should block, and tried to come up with something that would eat into his corner.

XCM: This is pretty good already, but keep in mind white's entire framework.]
;W[fq];B[dq];W[ep];B[cr];W[er];B[dr]C[M: I was happy with this result though.]
;W[fr];B[kh]C[M: My idea with this move is to help my group of stones, and pressure his. Later, I felt this might be a bad move, because i spent a move protecting a cut. Is there a better way for me to accomplish these goals in this situation?

XCM: I see your intentions, however in this situation your biggest concern is to deal with white's large influence. 

In this case you have to tread lightly. L12 is a good start.]
;W[lg]
(;B[lh]C[XCM: MUCH too slow. Develop lightly and quickly. See variation.]

XCM: See variation.];W[ni];B[lj];W[mk];B[hj]C[M: protecting another cut with a small move. Am I being too cautious? It seems that when I am not cautious, my opponent punishes me for being greedy.]
;W[km]C[M: At this point white's moyo is huge. whats the best way to reduce it? i tried pushing in, cutting, but it didn't seem to help much. is there any way at this point?

XCM: At this stage i would say it's a bit late.but there are a few places you can nibble away at his area. But first you muse make life in the centre.]

XCM - Overall it was a pretty good game. Some points to keep in mind for the future though:

* Apply pressure from the right direction. Don't do it in a way where they in turn can pressure you.

* Keep in mind not all groups are worthy of keeping alive. You can waste good moves trying to save a group, when they can be better served elsewhere, gathering territory. At all times, keep in mind the aim of the game. It is not to kill, or to stay alive, but to accumulate the most territory.

* Play key points. They were made into proverbs for a reason. Yo may not be able to read them now, but they will pay off in the future.

That's the most of it. Above all, play often, study life and death and have fun!

Sincerely,

Mark (XCMeijin)])

Here, i would focus, of course, on keeping K16 alive, and tearing through the centre to reduce white's influence. Those are your biggest issues right now.

M9 plays "at the centre of 3 stones", so shape-wise, it's a good move.]
