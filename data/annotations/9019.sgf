C[Hi Steve,

This was a good close game.. in fact it was still yours for the taking down to the final pass!  I'll add my comments and some variations with a particular eye for how I think you should be thinking in a given moment.  Players in the low double-digit kyus (myself included when I was there) often allow themselves to get stuck on autopilot responding to the opponent's sente without considering breaking off on their own.  I think your mid game could be improved a lot simply by asking the question.. do I really need to respond here or can I take sente somewhere else?

In the late game W ate you alive by taking the higher value moves while you used your sente to take small moves.  It will really improve your game to start counting how many points a move is worth (i.e. what's the point difference between W playing here first and B playing here first) in the late game.]
;B[pc];W[qp];B[dd];W[cp];B[qe]SQ[qi][pj][qj][qk]C[looking at extension to k16

David: I don't like this move.. it restricts B's framework too early.  Taking a larger framework still makes it uncomfortable for W to play on the top side or anywhere near R15, but at the same time makes the shimari at P3 or P4 worth quite a bit less (as you already took the extension).  As B it is helpful to be expansive with the first few moves.  I definitely agree you should play on the right side, but around the marked points would be better.]
;W[gd]
(;B[cf]C[is it right to defend here or maybe make a shorter extension to L16?

David: I think L16 would be very nice.  W can take C14, but you can apply plenty of pressure on G16 to keep yourself healthy (see variation).

The key for allowing yourself to have an isolated stone in the early game is that you HAVE to make that group strong.  You can't allow it to sit around and get weak or you will have big problems later on.  So the question you want to ask is: is there a weakness I can exploit to make my group strong right now?  If not, better to be conservative.  However, there are cases (and I think this is one) where isolating a stone early on is a much better choice.  The variation I added here addresses how to keep your group strong.

Also, if you do want to play on the left it might be better to play D13.  That is a more typical response to a more distant W approach.  C14 is a bit heavy and local.  Better to be somewhat expansive early on if you can do so safely.]
;W[jc];B[dj]SQ[fp][fq]C[This is the funny position playing C14 puts you in.  You're worried about W playing around D10, so you feel you have to play there, but really that leaves W the chance to do whatever he wants.  If C14 were at D13 instead it wouldn't be necessary to play this move and you could move into W's territory.  I feel move 7 at L16 would have been better, as you suspected.

In this case I like an approach move to C4 better than D10.  You can't let W have both of those shimaris without so much as a fight.  Since W has the opposite corner standard play is to avoid E3 or E4, so the marked squares are where I would probably move.]
;W[pj]C[This move gives W a lovely framework and really reduces B's options on the bottom.  Ouch!  It feels like W has the black stones now and can really bully B around.  That's the benefit of expansive play early on.  You aren't committed to defending a specific area, so you are more flexible, and there's nowhere on the board your opponent feels completely free to play.]
(;B[jq]SQ[fp]C[This move is always tempting for people in low single digit kyu because it solves the question: which side do I attack on?  However, in effect it allows W to answer that question however he wants.  One side is almost always better, and you should pick that one!  I this case I feel F4 is strongest because of your stone at D10.  The plan would be to find a way to be safe as quickly as possible and take sente to play on the right before W can.  I marked out one possible variation.]
;W[fq]
(;B[mq]C[Too timid.  This just ASKS W to make the perfect shimari at P3.  I would play more loosely here.  See variation.]
;W[oq]C[So good for W!];B[mc]C[I feel D7 or thereabouts is better for this move.  Your group on the bottom is still quite weak, and allowing W to have that extension would make it even tougher for that group.  This extension is worth a similar amount, so on balance I think D7 is better.  Remember: in the early game it's all about keeping your groups strong and your opponents' groups weak.]
;W[db]C[An odd choice for W.  You can punish this.]
(;B[cc]C[This is too timid and lets W get away with a strange move.  See variations.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[ec]C[Very inefficient from W.  D18 was a gift to B.]
;B[cm]C[This is good.];W[cb];B[bc];W[pm]C[Slightly timid from W, perhaps something like O5 would be more ambitious.]
;B[qh]C[At this point you need to start worrying about your bottom group.  It is still very vulnerable and W has amassed quite a wall around it.  O5 is a good place to start.  R12 can wait.  When you have the choice of where to play always make sure your weak groups are taken care of.]
;W[qj]C[A timid response from W.  It would be better to put more pressure on your bottom group.]
;B[hp]C[This is fine too, though I think O5 does more to restrict W, but this adds a lot to the safety of the group.]
;W[fo]C[Here I think W fell into the trap of following without thinking.  O5 would have been much more harmful.]
;B[fm]C[This is just okay.  It seems like you're trying to keep W from escaping, but W is perfectly safe.  You don't secure much territory with this move.  Something like O5 or P12 would be bigger.]
;W[hn]
(;B[jn]C[not sure about the placement of this move... it just seems strange to me now.

David: Yes, it doesn't accomplish much.  It seems like you're chasing the W group, which would be great if it were in any danger.  However, here your group is the weaker one.  One thought is to cut at G5.  I might favor that, as it does create a weak group for W and you may be able to profit by strengthening your bottom group.  See variation.

This version also leaves J5 for W, which is problematic.  See other variation.]
(;W[gf]C[Not sure what W is going for here.  P12 looks much more important to the overall territory battle.  O5 would also be a good place to strike, and there are still big issues at J5.]
;B[eg]SQ[bb][oh][ri][go][no][nr]C[This is a move where you get caught following.  G14 wasn't a terribly inspired move from W, but your response makes it a much better one as it becomes a sente move.  There are much larger territorial gains to be had elsewhere on the board.

This brings up an important topic.  There is a certain point in many of these more "peacible" type games where the edges are pretty well claimed and it's time to move into the center.  It becomes more challenging to evaluate moves at that point, but it's important to learn to do so.  I've highlighted some of the biggest moves left on the board with the square markers.  You'll notice half of those are low moves.  Many times the moves at the edge of the board are larger than they seem, while the ones in the middle are smaller.]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[iq];B[ip];W[hq]C[Very inefficient from W!  He has made two "empty trianges," here and at the top left.  Those are a terrible use of stones.  Here you can push in to punish this.  See variation.]
(;B[hm]C[What are you trying to do here!?  This move is out of the blue.  W's group is undenaibly strong, so you can't kill it.  Even if it were weak, this wouldn't be the way to go about killing it.  A cut at G5 is still very strong here, but this move will often cause W to reinforce and ruin that chance.  Aggressive contact plays like this have to be justified by some specific outcome you read, or simply because you need to create confusion.  Here your position is fine and you can continue to move ahead with solid big moves.  No confusion necessary.  I would cut this type of move out of your play almost completely.  H8 would be a much better option IF W's group were weak.  However, since it's not weak trying to contain it is folly.  W has plenty of routes into the center, so spending your time plugging this one up won't yield territorial dividends.

Okay, off my soap box :)  The reason I'm stating my reaction so strongly is that W doesn't respond to this move at all, but he very well could turn this area of the board into a mess.  I've included a few variations.]
(;W[gh]C[This move I actually like from W.  Attacking H7 directly would probably be better, but this move attacks it indirectly.  The value of B having a wall along the 7 row is now much reduced.  It also threatens to make something big by taking M16 or something like that.]
;B[no]C[This is fine.  Your group has some bad aji at K4, so an extra stone here is probably a good idea.  It is also a fairly big move.  It's also important to get a stone at the top (around M15) now that W has that big wall.]
;W[po]C[Unnecessary and small from W.. now he is following you without thinking it through.]
;B[nm]C[This is a good sequence for B.  Lots of territory gained.]
;W[ph]C[I would have gone with P12, but this is a decent idea.]
;B[pg];W[oh]
(;B[og]C[This is no good.  You've probably read the proverb "hane at the head of two stones" (in fact you do just that in a few moves).  This gives W a wonderful change to hane you, which he passes up (see the variation in which W turns this into amazing territory).  Better to use this move elsewhere.  See variation.]
(;W[ld]C[W doesn't take the hane.. so you should!!  See variation.]
(;B[md]C[Here we're back to following.  Yes, you can make territory there, but it gives W lots of compensation on the other side!  Let him take a little from you while you take a lot from him.  See variations.]
;W[lc]C[Bad from W!  It gives you a chance to hane at the head of 2 stones.]
;B[le]C[Good!  W gave you an opportunity here and you took it.  M17 was a senseless move, M15 would have been MUCH better for W.]
;W[ke]
(;B[lf]C[Double hane!!  See variations.  The double hane is a powerful move.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[qi];B[qg];W[ri];B[nh]C[Good, finally someone takes this hane!]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[nj]
(;B[jh]SQ[bb][lb][sh][nr][is]C[Lovely.  Taking both of those hanes from W was a big deal.

At this point the moves at the edge are becoming bigger than anything else except perhaps attacks around H6 and H7.  The marked moves are the most relevant ones.  J1 is sente (see variation) and O2 is likely to be sente.  B18 is large.  Certainly you should take the sente moves at this point.]
;W[rc]C[This is a silly invasion.. you just have to be careful in your response.]
;B[qc]C[This is fine.  Q18 would be good too.];W[qb];B[pb];W[qa]
;B[pa]C[S16 also works.];W[sb];B[ra];W[rb];B[rd];W[mb];B[nb]
;W[ma];B[na];W[lb];B[in]C[This is a decent way to address this situation, especially since you appear to be ahead.  If you were behind a cut might be a better choice.]
;W[gn];B[gm];W[gp]C[At this point J1 is no longer sente for B.. would have been nice to take it earlier!]
;B[fn]C[maybe this move should have been around D5, to eat in there a bit more?

David: Yes, this move isn't really getting you anything.  It's almost like filling in dame.  RIght now J1 and B18 are big.  If you wanted to play in this area I would probably go low, like B5.  I think the main lesson to take from this move is that you were already playing in this area, so you sort of kept playing here.  It's better to pause and look over the whole board unless you *have* to keep playing in an area (like move 81.. no question you have to play there).]
;W[en];B[em];W[dn];B[dm];W[cn];B[gj];W[hj];B[hk];W[ij];B[hi]
C[Some fun aggressive play!  At this point the game has become very close, so I fully endorse something like this (if you were leading comfortably I would say be safer).

Since we're going the route of the cut we should set some priorities from the start (often when things get messy we forget our priorities in the fray).  First, we cannot accept damage to the group on the left, and the K12 stone cannot be disconnected from the group at right.  If either one of those is going to take place we should give up the H11 stone.  Second, the object of the cut is to make the H10 group weak and profit from it.  We don't necessarily want to kill H10, but there may be some chance of doing so.  However the important thing is that we can't lose anything in a foolish attempt to kill H10!  Okay, now that we have the ground rules for this fight let's continue.]
;W[gi];B[fj];W[eh];B[dh]C[Good, no damage to the group at left.]
;W[ei];B[di];W[ej];B[ek];W[ik];B[fi]C[No!  This forces W to connect, which is always a waste of a ko threat.  However, in this case it also removes a liberty from the F10 stones which you don't want.  Never make these unnecessary moves!]
;W[fh];B[hh]C[Good.  Your group to the left is quite safe and this move isolates the H10 stones from any other W groups.  Now you can apply pressure to them and reap your reward!]
;W[hg];B[ih]SQ[ji]C[This is not optimal.  It makes a very inefficient shape.  K11 is the way to go here because it makes it much easier to connect to the black stones at right and begins to put pressure on the H10 stones.

Whenever you want to make a strong connection the "bamboo" joint is definitely a good shape.  That is two stones, a gap, and then two stones (i.e. the shape you would have made if you played at the marked point).]
;W[bm];B[cl]C[i think hane would have been better

David: Yes, definitely hane here.  However, I think the real focus should be N10.  That would all but seal off the H10 stones.  I'm surprised W just lets them go here.  Killing those stones would be worth W invading a bit at the left side.]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[ef]C[You can ignore this completely.  I would play N10 here and seal off the H10 group.  Losing the E13 stone is a small loss, but killing H10 would be huge.  This is another instance of following.  Remember to consider your options!  Often making the sacrifice is the way to go.  The main thing, however, is not to react just because your opponent played there.]
;B[df];W[ak];B[bj];W[fg];B[dg]C[Again, this is a very very small move.  If your opponent captures E13 it's a tiny loss.  Don't get caught following!]
;W[gk];B[fk];W[hl];B[gl]C[Ack!  This was your last chance to play N10 and seal W off.  Remember, one eye doesn't get you life.  W's group was still in big trouble even if he played G8.  It wasn't necessary to destroy this eye and it loses you the chance to kill the group.]
;W[lj]C[Doh!  W has escaped.  After this move the game is W's to win.]
;B[ee]C[This is very small!  B18, J1, O2, L14, and A10 are all bigger.]
;W[fd]C[Here W is following you.. this is very small.];B[ff]
C[This is a great ko threat, so it's best to save it for later.  White fills in gote, so he is unlikely to play it (and if he did it would be good for you).]
;W[gg];B[hk]C[Why this?  It's just a single point.  There is much bigger to be had.]
;W[ng]C[This is a poor choice of attack.  L13 would be much more damaging.]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[li];W[mi];B[mh];W[mj];B[ki];W[kj];B[il]C[Again, very small stuff here!]
;W[jl];B[jm]C[This is worth a single point!];W[kl];B[jf]C[Better!  This sequence takes advantage of W's need to keep the G13 stones connected.]
;W[je];B[he];W[ge];B[if]C[Excellent, a significant reduction to W.  Much better than the one point moves from before.]
;W[hd];B[aj];W[al]C[A mistake!];B[ok]C[B6!  But you realized that in the end :)

However, ignoring the missed move of B6, this is a good move.  Like the K14 sequence, this takes advantage of a weakness in W's shape for points.  Much better than the one points moves from before.]
;W[oj]
(;B[ol]C[again- maybe this should be at Q9, to take more out of the side?

David: No, this is correct.  Q9 would get those stones killed (see variation).  I bet you read that out at the time you made the move.]
;W[pk];B[pl];W[ql]
(;B[or]C[i thought this was a big move for a change...

David: It's actually an overplay, see variation.  The correct move is O2, and it's definitely big at this point.  See that variation as well.]

steve68 [12k\]: u2

David: My summary on move 1 says most of what I would advise.  I should add to that that every player benefits from tsumego, so I recommend that highly as well.  I think there are some clear paths to improvement in your game, particlarly in the middle and late game.  To reiterate: 

Your early game is reasonable.  You keep yourself out of trouble.  In fact, if I were to change your play it would be to start exploring how to be slightly more aggressive.  This doesn't mean chasing stones to kill them (bad!) or making bad contact moves, but rather taking opportunities to isolate opponents' stones.  That almost always involves isolating your own stones, so how to manage weak groups (i.e. to make yours stronger and your opponents' weaker) is the key skill.  This is one of those "it will get worse before it gets better" improvements where there may be a few disasters along the way.  I would work on your middle and late game first perhaps.

In the middle game try to avoid following your opponent.  If a response isn't necessary for the strength or survival of your group, take a second to reevaluate the whole board.  Often the best move won't be near where your opponent just played.  As the saying goes: "urgent, then big."  If your opponent doesn't leave you with anything urgent to do, it's time to look for something big.

In the late game, count count count!  Learn to estimate (or better yet, count exactly) the worth of a move and stick to the big sente ones, then the big gote ones.  If you had used some of your moves to grab the big late game points (like B18, T12, and J1) rather than capturing a single stone I think you would have come out well ahead in this game.]
