AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[pmurphy:  Thanks for your review!  I took black in this game.  I haven't played anyone this much stronger than me in a while, it was a lot of fun!  There are some things I thought I did well and some things I have questions about, I look forward to studying your review.

rs220675: You played quite fine for a 9k and you showed some good skills, but also some bad mistakes. Try to think and play bigger in the beginning and to realize not to put too much effort into one area since that's often very costly.]
;W[nq]C[pmurphy [9k\]: thanks for playing
meadowlane [5k\]: hi]
(;B[pm]C[rs220675: Not good, see var.];W[qk];B[qh]C[rs220675: Good!]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[qj];B[ph];W[ok];B[oj]C[pmurphy: is foiling the bamboo joint here lower urgency than I thought it was?

rs220675: I don't know what a bamboo joint is :) but it looks good for black here, white is heavy and not alive - two things that are huge in the fuseki.]
;W[om];B[on];W[pl];B[qm];W[nn];B[oo];W[nm];B[oc]C[rs220675: Too slow. Try to fill bigger spots. One of the worst mistakes is to make such small moves in the fuseki or early game (if they are not necessary), because in this stage of the game it's almost impossible to secure area for sure. When you play small have at least one more goal like playing at P3 to secure the corner and attack the white stone at O3.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[qr];B[dj]C[rs220675: Good!];W[ro];B[qo];W[cf]

(;B[fd]C[rs220675: That's not bad, but not good either, see var.]
;W[hd];B[jc]C[rs220675: Good!];W[gc]
(;B[ld]C[rs220675: Too small. You don't need tp play such a move right now. Even if there's an invasion e.g. at M17 you have enough options., see var. for better moves than M16.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[bd]
(;B[dc]C[rs220675: Not really good, because white lives and black is heavy and not settled, see var.]
;W[bc]C[pmurphy:  I was expecting a straightforward 3x3 invasion.  At this point I didn't think there was anything I could do to save it, but I tried anyway at the end since I was behind and didn't have anything to lose but more points.

rs220675: See my variation of how you should have played.];B[dm]
C[rs220675: No really efficient. It doesn't secure the 3-3 area there, but it's also kind of small...better play big at K4.]
;W[gf];B[hq]C[rs220675: That's ok, though I would prefer K4 or J3.]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[pmurphy: right direction here?];W[dq];B[eq];W[er]
;B[fq];W[bp];B[bo];W[br];B[kq];W[fr];B[eo]C[rs220675: G3 would have been better and more simple to avoid any insecurities of cuts there.]
;W[lq]
(;B[lr]C[pmurphy: on reviewing this, I think the other hane would have been better

rs220675: Both is possible to play here.];W[mr];B[kr];W[lp]
;B[kp]C[pmurphy: i think the other hane would have prevented me from "pushing the cart from behind" here...still, I felt L4 was too big to leave to give up.]
;W[rq];B[rp]C[rs220675: Not good since you provoce a kofight that is not in your favor (because you lead)...play better at S6.]
;W[sp];B[rn];W[qp];B[pn];W[pq];B[op];W[rl];B[rm]C[pmurphy: I was thrilled to have survived, but any input you can give me on resisting that invasion would be great.

rs220675: Well you couldn't resist this invasion because you allowed White to put some stones there earlier, but that's ok. Never forget: You can't have everything, you have to give away some areas too. Right now it looks good for black.]
;W[hn];B[kn];W[fj];B[ch];W[cg];B[dg]C[rs220675: Not good! Don't give your opponent cutting points if you are not sure it's an advantage, play better at D12.]
;W[bh];B[ci];W[df];B[eg];W[ef];B[jf];W[fg];B[ei];W[fi];B[mj]
;W[fl];B[kh]TR[fh][mj][gm]C[pmurphy: at this point I was feeling pretty good about things, I was confident I could live in the west, hold on to the northeast corner, and soak up enough of the center to give white a run for her money.

rs220675: Well that's pretty much how we weak players think :). We emphasize too much on one area and its territory. But good players still could easily invade in your upper moyo. The two marked stones you could have used to attack at the marked positions with more benefit longtermwise.

Also you seemed completely to have forgotten your upper stones around D17. They are dead and that gives White a huge benefit. It's just that one looks always at the big upper moyo and underestimates the big points White gets at the left upper side (with all the prisoners).]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[gr];B[io]C[rs220675: Better at H4, otherwise see var. what could happen.]

(;B[re]C[rs220675: see var.];W[qg];B[qf];W[sg];B[pg]C[pmurphy: there must have been a better way for me to handle that.  Variation please?]
;W[rg];B[qe];W[jd];B[kc];W[ic];B[ke];W[ib];B[jb];W[if];B[ig]
;W[hf];B[hh]C[pmurphy: an impulse move, a bad habit of mine.  I was trying to deprive white of an eye at G13, but I had no good reason for doing so, since that group was alive.

rs220675: Never do this move again :).];W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[bl]
;W[ek]C[pmurphy: this move floored me.  I couldn't successfully cut now, and I was on the run.

rs220675: Well, because B10 was weak again. Your building of the upper moyo neglected other areas of your game like patching weak spots and the upper left side. And NOW it is payback time for White.]
;B[cj];W[cm];B[bm];W[cn];B[co];W[hs];B[iq];W[jn]C[pmurphy [9k\]: you mind if i submit this game for a review on the go teaching ladder?]
;B[jo]C[meadowlane [5k\]: not at all];W[in]C[pmurphy [9k\]: sweet.  I can tell this one's gonna givew me some things to ponder.  hehe]
;B[lo];W[mp];B[fh]C[pmurphy: not a very good move maybe, but I was starting to think maybe I had better make sure I had an eye left around D12

rs220675: Well from now on teaching is not very senseful anymore, because usually at your level, any mistake now is just triggered by a more fundamental mistake before, so I will just point out very obvious things now.]
;W[gh];B[eh];W[hi];B[ii];W[fp];B[fo]C[pmurphy: best response?

rs220675: Well ,the spot was just weak and White explored it, so I guess your answer was ok.]
;W[ep];B[ho];W[gn];B[go];W[dn];B[do];W[em];B[dk];W[dl]C[pmurphy:  I feel like I was really getting pushed around here, I was no longer feeling as good about my score as I was.  My only source of optimism at this point was the thought that I could eat into white's potential territory around H9]
;B[hj];W[gi];B[gk]C[pmurphy: on reflection this was a bad move, I should have gone for a solid connection or maybe a one-space jump

rs220675: Yes, it was bad. Play at J10 or J9 or K10.];W[gl]
;B[ik];W[jk];B[hl];W[hm];B[km];W[se];B[rd];W[ls];B[jr];W[is]
;B[js];W[gs];B[mo];W[ji];B[jh]C[pmurphy: I think J10 would have been better

rs220675: Yes.];W[ij];B[np];W[jj];B[mq]C[pmurphy: reasonable exchange?

rs220675: Well, yes...these three white stones were huge, esp. because it creates a further threat for White.]

;W[so];B[oq];W[or];B[fb]C[pmurphy: seeing that I was behind, I figured a desperate attempt to save my northwest group would be educational at least.  My thinking here was maybe I could get some extra tempo by threatening the C13 or B17 groups.

rs220675: This group is only living when two 20k's are playing :). No way, but sure one can try....]

pmurphy: tadaa!  reviewing the score, it seems as though I would have lost whether I tried to save the northwest group or not, but It seems as though I may have been able to win by living there.  Thanks again for the review!]
