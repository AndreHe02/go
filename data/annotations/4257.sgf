C[Hello! I'm Black in this game, and i'm requesting review on behalf
of both Black ~and~ White.  :)  If the reviewer could point out the
"Big" mistakes that both sides made we would be much appreciated. My
comments will be as [B:\]

Hi, I'm white (11 kyu at www.littlegolem.net) and my comments will be as [W:\]

[JWS\]: 

Hello. Although I believe we all speak Dutch, I will write this review in English, for the GTL-archive.

I'll concentrate on the first 75 moves.

I will start my comments with [JWS\].];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
;B[qk];W[dj];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[jp]C[[JWS\]: Until now the development is quite normal. White has played more stones on the fourth line. than black. White is concentrating on influence, while black is playing more for territory.]
;B[fq]LB[po:B][pq:A]C[[B:\] A mistake?

[JWS\]: I don't think so. I do like the side of approach, because your stone gets support from a distance from A. 

Another possibility would be B. But because white played his stones high and you low, I do believe that white would have the advantage in the moyo game that is appearing.]
;W[eq]LB[cn:C][dn:B][jp:A]C[[JWS\]: By touching the black stones, white makes the black stone stronger. That will have it's effect on A. (That doesn't mean the wihite play is bad).  Playing at B or C is an alternative.]
;B[fp];W[hq]LB[cn:B][dn:A]C[[JWS\]: I would play A or B. The corner is big.]

(;B[fn]LB[do:A]TR[jp][hq]C[[JWS\]: A is an interesting alternative to strengthen the black stones, preparing for an attack on the marked stones.]

(;W[mq]LB[dn:A]C[[W:\] I felt my stones in the bottom-centre needed a root
harder than my stones in the lower left corner. Would D6 have been
better?

[JWS\]: Yes, D6 is called for. 
Firstly, the corner is big. 
Secondly, your move contains no threath for black.
Thirdly, D6 puts pressure on the black group. When black attacks your K4-group  from his F3-group, you can still expand to N3. On the other hand, when black attacks from Q3, you can gain strength by putting pressure on blacks F3-group.]
;B[cn]C[[JWS\] Good move. Splitting white, threathening the corner and preparing good form for black.]
;W[co]C[JWS: white's cornergroup is in trouble already, and I am not strong enough to calculate the variations.

Again, touching the black stone strengthens the black group, but I do believe it is called for now.

Here you can see that not playing on the left side means a big loss.]
;B[dn];W[cq]C[[W:\] Not happy with this corner shape and b's outer influence.

[JWS\]: You have exchanged it for your K4-group. Painful is that you end in gote.]
;B[ck]C[JWS: I don't like this move too much. White is gaining more above the C10 stone, than black with your overconcentrated stones.

The black F3-group is quite strong. I would try to strengthen it a bit more by pressuring the K4-group and then invade between C14 and D10. In that way you would better make use of your strength.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[ej];B[ek];W[fk];B[fl]LB[fj:A]C[JWS: Black plays submissive, giving white more than he is getting. Picking up a fight with A would be more my choice.]
;W[gk];B[gl]LB[fe:B][hm:A]C[JWS: This move doesn't do much. If Black wants to get out, he can better jump ahead with a move like A.

But I do think there is not much to win for Black in the lower left. A move like B would be very good, because it would make the white wall less of worth]
;W[fe]C[[W:\]Trying to make territory here...

JWS: Until now White is happy. Black has gained just a few points with his strong group, while white is building quite a big moyo.]
;B[he]LB[gd:A]C[[JWS\]: the white group being strong, touching it would be a good alternative. You leave a weakness at A.]
;W[gd]TR[ic][pd][qk]C[[JWS\]: fighting here makes black stronger. That's very interesting for him because of his (marked) double wing formation. I would consider changing to the right side.]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[ie];B[je];W[if];B[jf];W[ig]C[[JWS\]: now white is doing the same bad thing as black did earlier: giving him a wall that works great with his corner stone.]
;B[jg];W[ih];B[hk]LB[ki:A]C[JWS: I would play a move like A. It jumps ahead of white and makes it difficult for a attacking white stone in the upper right to escape.]
;W[hj];B[ij];W[hi];B[hl]C[[B:\] Looking back, J8 would probably have been better, but i
was worried bout the forcing moves of H7 and K9.

JWS: I would doubt about J8 to. Especially the peep at H7 would be nasty, because the white stones at the bottom.]
;W[ii];B[jh]LB[ki:A]C[JWS: again, A gives the best chance of to confine white a little.]
;W[pn]LB[qf:A]C[[W:\] _need_ to do something. I send out an explorer far from b's walls

JWS: finally. Remember: you are the one who gave black the walls.

Then again, the upper right is the most urgent. Black is threatening to create a huge territory. Especially when he gets to play a move like A.]
;B[qo];W[nj]LB[qj:A]C[[W:\] Another brave explorer all alone in the field.

JWS: firstly: this move does nothing in particular. A move like A gives a better chance at a fight, and that is what you need right now.]
;B[ol]LB[ph:A]C[[JWS\]: What about a simple move around A. White has not much to win in the lower center because the strong group at H8.]
;W[ml];B[no]LB[nh:A]C[[B:\] O7 better?

JWS: I still do think you are making it yourself too difficult. Close off the upper right and white has not much to fight for.]
;W[ln];B[lo];W[kp];B[ko]
(;W[qf]C[JWS: finally. But I am afraid white is playing to deep into blacks sphere of influence. White could try to get some strength in the center right and then attacking the upper right.]

(;B[qh]C[JWS: you are pressing white into your moyo. What about the variation?]
;W[ng];B[of]
(;W[nf]C[[JWS\]: white is starting to make a heavy group: a string of stones without eyespace. Playing more lightly,]
;B[og];W[nh];B[oi];W[ni];B[ne];W[oj]C[[JWS\]: White has given black 5th line territory and has no eye shape.]
;B[pi];W[ji];B[ki];W[kj];B[jj];W[kk];B[li];W[ik]C[[JWS\]: nice sequence.]
;B[mj];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl];B[ll];W[mn];B[mo];W[kn];B[lm];W[km]
;B[lk];W[nn];B[jl]C[[B:\] By now i was giving up "Killing" the O13 group, and
hoping to get something from the bottom.];W[jk];B[kl];W[in]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[jo];W[im];B[io];W[il];B[kr]C[[JWS\]: nice sequence.]
;W[hr]C[[W:\] Don't think fighting L2 would have been wise with all
those black stones closely watching.

[JWS\]: I think you are right, but when you give up fighting, maybe it is wiser to give up the game. Black is far ahead.]
;B[lq];W[fr];B[lp]C[B:\] Not the most profit i had hoped but i was happy, was
there another way to profit?

JWS: don't underestimate the gain. You are far ahead, so it is wise to play safely.]
;W[ip];B[me];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[rc]
(;B[rg];W[rf];B[qm]LB[qn:A]C[[JWS\]: simply A is a lot better.]
;W[qn];B[rn];W[ho];B[po]C[[W:\] At this time, I thought that I was behind. Plan was to
separate the d6 group and see if I can give him a hard time. Was there
anything (else) I could/should do here?

[JWS\]: I think there not much to do elsewhere.];W[bm];B[cm]

[JWS\]: Black and white make the same mistake in the game. They both give each other a big moyo, because they are giving the other a big wall. The right side got neglected a long time, while the most points were to be gain there.

I hope you enjoyed this review.])
