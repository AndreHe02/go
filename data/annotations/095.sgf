TM[2400]KM[0.000000];B[cd];W[tt];B[pd];W[tt];B[co];W[tt];B[pp];W[ed]C[hhmmm.  I don't know why you would chose not to take the hoshi points in a handicap game.  As it stands, you have 4 moves, but 2 corners still require help.  If you had taken the hoshi (handicap) points, all of your corners would be self-sufficient, giving you more latitude to attack.]
;B[ec]L[fc]C[b is better, gives you a better handicap game, leaves the position more fluid.   this way you don't make c5 into such a strong stone.  This is not a monumental difference.  A does offer black a more complicated joseki, that is chances to mess up.]
;W[dd]C[10 faces the black stone ant the lower left corner, this isn't the best attack.]
;B[dc];W[ce];B[fd];W[cc];B[bd];W[cb];B[be];W[df]C[Ooops :)  Forgot, you are white here.]
;B[fe]C[for black the atari at c14 is simpler, and also good.];W[ef]L[aa]
[db]C[
b (not in the corner) is better for black]
(;B[cf];W[fc];B[ee]C[black is reducing his own liberties, seems pointless.]
;W[de];B[fb];W[gc];B[ea]L[aa][db]C[atari is better here.];W[da];B[cg]
L[di][dh][cj]C[a is fine, but white is already connected since the upper side is white.   Consider b and c also. a is not bad.   d is still larder in scale.  a is thick, though.]

(;W[ff]C[a is a bad move];B[hd]L[di]C[Now you see why the atari at d18 was better, it left less aji.  Still, moving these stones for black is a poor decision.  Your next move is not best, better to pincer, take advantage of blacks weakness on the left.]
;W[ep]C[Here, black settles easily at a.];B[dq];W[eq];B[dr];W[iq];B[hc]
;W[gb]L[hb]C[a is wrong, black should take this opportunity to come back and make territory out of his weak stones on the left. black can continue his sente moves on the top.  B has transformed useless forcing stones into thickness, because you didn't atari the dead black stones.
B transforms the mess on the left into reasonable stones, if black B, black is winning.]
;B[pj]L[cj]C[a move around b is still sente.  You should take it while you have it.  It leaves you with the initialtive to make big moves elsewhere.]
;W[nc]L[hb]C[Because black still has the forcing moves on the top left, 40 is not the best approach.  B is much stronger, it is sente against the white top, and allows severe attacks on your kikari.]
;B[lc];W[ne];B[pf]C[Since black still has sente attacks on the top, a doesn't work the way it normally would.]
;W[kd]L[hb]C[Man, why doesn't black ever play b!??];B[ld];W[le];B[hb]
;W[eb];B[me];W[md];B[mf]C[A is not a good move, maybe since you are in a bind here, maybe you have to do it.]
;W[mc];B[kc];W[pc]L[qc]C[Black pulls your bacon out of the fire here.  If B, white can settle, but black makes cash in the meantime.]
;B[od]L[oc]C[a is wrong, b is needed.];W[qd];B[oc];W[ob];B[pb];W[qc]
;B[nb];W[qb];B[oa]C[The pain!  Connecting in the corner looks so much better now.]
;W[rf]C[a is bad, black can leave this and take sente.];B[qe];W[re]L[kq]
C[B is better, pressures your stones, while making large frameworks on the right.  Both white and black should remember the left side though.]
;B[mq]C[Finally white A. :-)];W[ci]L[dh]C[Black should think about b, though a makes eyes...]
;B[af]C[Consider b, the white stone on the left has no trouble.  Black can ignore a.]

(;W[cl]C[After b, black is winning again.  A is awful.  C seems good, but isn't, D is the right move locally.]

(;B[em]C[B can finish in sente.]
(;W[dn];B[en];W[do];B[cn];W[dm]C[White is happy with his result in the lower left.  Black a should be one point up, at r5.]
;B[qp]C[B is the right move here... (with variations)]

(;B[lm]
(;W[ln];B[lo];W[ll];B[mm];W[ml];B[kl];W[jm]C[Both players are ignoring the lower left corner.]

(;B[kk];W[lj]C[a is ugly, hard to see how black can do better having decided to play this way.]
;B[jj]M[ml]C[a is too lise, black can cut or attach.]
(;W[kh]C[a is not relevant.  White can abandon this stone, if he wants to]
;B[jp]C[But....   He doesn't want to.];W[kq];B[jq]C[A is wrong, gives black play.  Allowing black to even b almost alive on the bottom is a tragedy for white.]
