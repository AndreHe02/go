C[This is a game on KGS.
I am Zordon[2d\](White)
my opponent is some french guy, 1d.
He played rather fast and unconcentrated.
I am quite frustrated that I struggled so much.

Hi! Thanks for submitting the game, it ws an interesting one.

Black took a lot of influence early on, and took a big lead, since w scored less than ten points on the right in exchange. Black played well but extended one space too far on the left, which left white a good invasion. Black should still have had the lead, since any fight is obviously in his favour, but both sides had poor fighting technique and nothing exciting happened.
If black had been more coordinated, this could have been an easy win. You seemed surprised at how close it was, so maybe you should look again at the start of the game and re-evaluate black's lead after getting the wall. Maybe also look at the end result and notice how easy it was for black to score points because of his thickness, even late into the endgame.
Anyway, you fought better than black and it was a well-deserved victory, so well played! If you have any questions at all, just email me or find me on KGS (I'm "sixsix")]

TR[nq]C[I wonder what your plan was here - white seems likely to end up with a low result on the top, assuming the usual end to the joseki in the top left. I would prefer O3 instead, to develop the more interesting 4-4 stone. But this is just personal preference; it's hard to do anything wrong in the opening.]

Yes, this is natural. Tenuki is an option too.];B[pc]C[This seems like the wrong direction but...]

I thought about the marked moves.

This looks urgent, to erase the thickness. You can't stop b sealing the right side.]
;B[rj]C[Very painful for w];W[rh]LB[pk:A]C[I have less territory than in the other variation.
S18 is sente for black - I think he should play it.
However, black has a cut at A.]
(;B[df];W[fc];B[dk]TR[di][cm][cn][fp][jp][fq][nq]C[I dont know how to play now.

I've marked some options. K4 would be my move, since you need to stop b making a moyo. This extension is too far, and D11 invasion is the correct local move. Your move is ok too, but  b should ignore it and play on the bottom.]

(;W[cm];B[em];W[bk]
(;B[jp]C[Strong play from black. The centre is looking scarier every move. However, that overextension is about to cause him trouble.]

(;W[di]LB[fe:C][eq:A][or:B]C[This move was not good I think.
But I believe some invation must be possible.
A, B and C are other ideas I had.

This is good, it's the move that won the game. Black's overextension to D9 is a problem now. Those three stones could be sacrificed if black could get some good thickness, but the game would then be closer than black would like]
