C[DanielTom (DT) - Hello mythical. Nice to meet you.
Sorry for the delay in making this review.

Your opponent's third move, tengen, made this game really interesting and fun to watch.
The main focus of the game for you was, or should have been, how to make that stone not work.
When your opponents plays at tengen, the basic strategy for you should be to play solidly and avoid fights, in order to make his stone in the center less useful.
You were not careful enough in this regard. That to me indicates a lack of whole board understanding. That is to say that you focus too much on local events, instead of looking at the bigger picture (e.g. move 15).
That tendency to lose focus of the bigger picture is somewhat related to the bad habit of following your opponent around, always answering his moves (e.g. move 25). My main advice to you: at least consider tenuki before responding locally to your opponent's move.
Is it really necessary to answer his move, and play in that area? Or is there a more urgent move elsewhere? 
If you want to be stronger than 1d it is very important for you to start thinking a bit more outside the box. Try to be more creative!
You lost this game because you let many opportunities to defend your right side territory pass by (e.g. move 121). You could and should have defended it before White's invasion, so it was a sad loss for you.
You also made some mistakes in yose (e.g. move 157), but that is not so important.
What is important is to make your approach to this game more flexible, and less dependent on answering to your opponent's move locally. Always remember: urgent before big!
At your level, you have to anticipate to triumph.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[fq]
(;W[jj]C[DT - This move is interesting, but I don't think it is a good plan.]
(;B[cj]TR[jj]C[DT - The idea behind this move is good.
Black's task: he has to prove that tengen is not useful :)]
;W[cl]
(;B[cf]TR[jj]C[DT - Black should try to play more solidly to avoid any fights.
You don't want to give White a chance to make use of the marked stone (see variation).]
(;W[bd]LB[ch:A]C[DT - How about invading at A?]
(;B[ef]LB[dh:A]C[mythical - this is my usual response , the right one?

DT - I don't like this move. It doesn't really defend your weaknesses.
Personally, I would prefer to play at A. See variation.];W[gd]
C[mythical - wierd move by white]
(;B[ic]TR[jj]C[mythical - is this the right way to punish?

DT - The direction of play seems to be wrong.
Please try to have the whole board in mind. I still think you should defend again at the left side, so as to make White's marked stone useless.
See variation.];W[gc]
(;B[lc]C[DT - Too soft!
Black here was very unimaginative.
You can still leave the top for later and play elsewhere (see variation).]
;W[ej]TR[lc][ef]C[mythical - in my opinion this was very interesting move by white

DanielTom - Yes, and you should not have allowed it.
It was the fault of the marked moves.]
(;B[dk]CR[cf][ef]LB[bi:A]TR[dg]SQ[cj]C[mythical - i still feared white would play the triangle move (d 13) and try to separate my stones from each other which would result with 2 black weak groups.

DT - Black has no choice here. You have to get out,
Later White can also consider the attack starting with A.];W[fl]
;B[dl];W[cm];B[di]TR[dl][cm]C[mythical - white is separated and and i fixed my group before he can make any kind of damage , so here i was kind of happy.

DT - Defending your group was a good idea.
But White got his bonus (marked).
So you should have "fixed" your group before White started his attack.]
;W[eq]
(;B[jp]C[DT - Black can play here if he does not want to fight.]
;W[fp]
(;B[gq]LB[cq:A]C[DT - Your main problem is that you focus too much on local positions. Try to see the bigger picture!
This move is big, but it should be saved for late middle-game or even endgame.
Black shouldn't play here just now. It is best to tenuki (see variation).
Later it might be better to play a probe at A first, before playing G3.]
;W[gp];B[hq];W[np]TR[gp][gq][hq]C[DT - You can see now that the marked moves were slow...]
(;B[pn]C[mythical - such silly mistake by me

DT - I don't think this is a mistake.];W[pq];B[qq];W[pr]
(;B[qr]LB[op:A]C[DT - This feels too submissive.
Is Black A better?];W[op];B[po];W[lp]C[DT - Good result for White.]
;B[kq];W[lr]LB[lq:A]C[DT - Just A is better for White.];B[lq]
;W[mq];B[kr];W[mr];B[er]LB[mo:A]C[DT - Maybe you should peep at A first ("play a forcing move before making life").]
;W[dr];B[fr]TR[cr]C[DT - It is a bit painful to live like this, but at least you now have the aji in the corner as a bonus.]
(;W[qd]TR[ic][lc]C[DT - Your position at the top is not so good.
White could also consider san san (see variation).];B[qc]C[DT - Good choice.]
(;W[pe]LB[qe:A]C[mythical - kind of wierd move by white again.

DT - White should play A (see variation).]
(;B[pc]LB[od:A]C[mythical - atari would make the game complicated , i try to keep it simple...

DT - I see.
If you want to keep it simple, extending at A is best.
Atari is complicated, but possible (see variations).]
(;W[qf]LB[qe:A]C[DT - White's moves were rather strange.
Usually he must connect at A here.];B[qh]C[mythical - of cource i needed to attack here , is this move too close?

DT - Right move. No, it is not too close.];W[ne]
(;B[od]C[DT - Bad shape. At least play P15 first, to create some problems in White's shape...]
;W[oe]C[DT - Now White's shape is too good.];B[oh];W[rc];B[rd]
C[mythical - if oponent challanges you to a ko , why not accept?  :)

DT - Dangerous ko...];W[re];B[qe];W[mc];B[md];W[qd];B[cq];W[dq]

;B[dm];W[cn];B[qe]
(;W[me]C[DT - Wrong threat. White should play the other atari.]
;B[ld]C[DT - Now even if Black loses the ko, at least his group is safe.
The ko is not so heavy for you anymore.];W[qd];B[do];W[co];B[qe]

(;B[em]LB[fm:A]C[mythical - i lost the ko , but i felt i gained the local advantage on points here.

DT - I agree, Black is fine now.
A looks better, instead of E7.];W[en];B[fm];W[gn];B[gm];W[dg]
(;B[df]C[DT - Greedy move.
It is about time you finish the game. Don't let this opportunity slip! See variation.]
;W[bg];B[cg];W[bf];B[gf]C[DT - This looks slow too.];W[fg];B[ff]
(;W[bh]
(;B[ch]C[DT - You lost another chance to defend the right side... See variation.]

(;B[ei];W[le]
(;B[kd]LB[pk:A]TR[rc][nd][qd][sd][le][me][ne][oe][pe][re][qf]
[oh][qh]C[DT - Is this the losing move?
White has a really thick wall, so if he gets to invade at A he can not only destroy your moyo but also attack your two marked stones.
It is really urgent for you to defend the right side! See variation!]
;W[pi]C[DT - White noticed it first.
It is really sad...]
(;B[ph];W[pk];B[ni];W[nk];B[lh];W[lk];B[jh]C[mythical - actually , i felt kind of lucky to get out.

DT - But White destroyed all your potential territory on the right... He is leading now.]
;W[ke];B[ij]C[DT - Tenuki, always good.];W[jd];B[kc];W[ik];B[hj]
;W[ji];B[ih];W[hk];B[gj];W[nm]C[DT - It is a close game now. Whoever plays the best yose wins.]
(;B[mo];W[no];B[mn];W[nn]
(;B[mp]C[DT - I don't think this move is that good. See variation.]
;W[mm];B[ko];W[kn]C[DT - Too painful.];B[lo];W[qm]C[DT - Good move. White's yose is better.]

;W[ps];B[rr]C[DT - Too painful again...];W[hb]C[DT - This is huge, and White got it.
Now it is very hard for you to win.
Later your move at F18 was nice, but it wasn't enough for you.
