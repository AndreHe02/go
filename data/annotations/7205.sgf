C[Jeff: Hello, I will be putting my comments in like this to distinguish between what was already written below. I have some closing comments on the last move. Overall you did well given some small mistakes that caused an avalanche of black pushing through and claiming territory.

Hello,
i am white in this game. i can't get any grip on the game. All I do is defending. Also I am loosing almost my whole moyo without making good use of it. It would be nice to know how i should have played.]

You create some small hole for black to push through, then you must defend what happened. So, be careful of that. Also, try to be more away of when you are in atari or are low on liberties. I think the best way to improve right now is to do a bunch of tesuji like problems to see how to handle tight situations and make precise good moves. Websites like www.goproblems.com have just tons of these. Once you have this handled, much of the rest should fall into place nicely. Great job. Keep up the good work!
Jeff

Game ends here as I see no way to turn this game. What would be good to do? Invading black maybe at R5? or reaching from the top to the center?

Thank zou for reviewing my game!])
