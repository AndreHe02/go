hi i'm eric   (    ericosman@rcn.com   ) and I'll be happy to review your game]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kd]C[L16 should be at L17 , not L16 and not K16 because of the invasion issue at M17.  Do not confuse with white playing L16 or K16 immediately after R14 which would be fine.]
;B[pj];W[qn];B[nq]C[I think I should have played Q8 or R8 (I think both are okay?) Then if white plays R3 then I think it is joseki, and if white jumps out then I should play O8, and consider R4 or S4 at some point later to secure the corner


the o3 is better than q8 or r8 because q10 is already pincering so r8 is inefficient double pincer to which white could answer at r3]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[rj];B[ql];W[rl]C[

I would consider answering white s8 at black s7 because s10 was too long an extension.  r8 looks like good way to start the punishment, but black should probably follow through]
;B[pn];W[qk];B[pk];W[qm];B[pm];W[pl];B[ol];W[qh];B[ph]C[
the problem with black q12 is that it's too easy for white to invade at j3 on the bottom.   i would consider j4 for black instead of q12 in order to breathe life into the value of the big wall on the right]
;W[fp]
(;B[hq]C[

i think because of the big wall, i would consider high like h4 or j4 instead of h3.   or, consider d6 patient answer .]
;W[dq];B[fo]C[as white i'd want to look for an opportunity to play g4 or h4 in order to prevent black from blocking at g4]
;W[cp];B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[ep]C[
what if white had played h4 instead of e4 ?

It seems black is playing the lower left corner as though the wall on right doesn't exist.  it's important to use the stones already played.

as black, i'd want to play g4 as soon as possible];B[gp]C[Looking at it know I feel I should have connected (though I am sure I went entirely wrong from the start)]
;W[go];B[ho];W[eo]C[
how about black f6 ?]
(;B[en];W[fn];B[dl];W[hn]
(;B[io];W[kp];B[ko]C[
instead of touching white with L5, how about J6 instead and let white worry about being in a sea of black.

Again, the theme is, use that wall !];W[lo];B[lp];W[jo];B[kn]
;W[jp];B[jn];W[in];B[iq];W[lq];B[mp];W[jq];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir]
C[Definitely think I should have played J4 here
Also, I think that E3 would have been good at some point here, not sure when though.]
;W[mq];B[np];W[nr];B[or];W[mr];B[ln]
(;W[gr];B[gq];W[fr];B[ls]C[Was this necessary?];W[os];B[pr]
(;W[fc]C[
i'm glad white lost the battle at the bottom since he deserved to , given the greater number of black stones down there to begin with]
;B[df];W[ce];B[cf];W[dj]C[
i'm still wondering if black should use the c3 defect to help the d6 group.  it's trickier now since before the e3 cut threatened f3 atari, but now white can answer e3 with f3 which might resurrect white stones in the lost fight at bottom]
;B[ej]C[

when in a fight like this i like not to "touch" the stone.  for example, black f8 comes to mind instead of e10]
;W[ei];B[dk];W[di];B[fj]C[
black f10 seems dangerous because what if white f13 now ?];W[fl]
;B[ek];W[fi];B[ff];W[gj];B[cn];W[em]C[
maybe black c3 now ?]
(;B[gi];W[hj];B[gh];W[cj];B[ck]C[
i would consider b9 instead of c9];W[bm];B[bn];W[bk];B[eq];W[fq]
;B[cq];W[dr];B[bq];W[br];B[bp]C[
black b4 not needed

how about playing c7 instead and assuming white answers it, continue attacking with c12 ?]
;W[an];B[cr];W[cs];B[ao]C[
a5 not needed.  maybe black should attak with c12 instead ?]
;W[am];B[aq];W[bg];B[bf]C[

too bad white got b13 before black got c12];W[be];B[af];W[eg]
;B[ef];W[fg];B[gg];W[ch];B[gf];W[hd];B[bl]C[

note that black ends up playing d7 in gote later.

how about c7 instead of b8 in order to connect in sente];W[al]
;B[cm];W[cl];B[ah];W[bj];B[bh];W[cg];B[ag];W[bl];B[dm]C[
for black to have to play d7 in pure gote is painful];W[bi]
C[reallyreal [9k\]: almost thought I had that
reallyreal [9k\]: nicely played
sbloob [7k\]: mm you re good];B[ae];W[bc]C[reallyreal [9k\]: thanks  :)]
;B[jh]C[I did this because I couldn't think of anything better to do - it really was a nothing move]
;W[ih];B[ig];W[hh];B[jf];W[kg];B[jg];W[jj];B[ki]C[
what about the bottom ?  now that white got the f3 move in place can black still win the L4 battle if white goes first ?]
(;W[pg]C[
almost always, with a move like white q13, black should answer at either r13 or r11 .]
(;B[oh];W[qg];B[qb]C[
black needed to help this upper right, so the question is, would r13 for black instead of p12 helped it ?


white r13 just became sente which is painful for black];W[pc]
;B[rf]
(;W[pf]C[
white q15 looks better than q14];B[pe];W[rd];B[rc];W[rg];B[sf]
;W[mf]C[

t13 is sente for white now];B[kj];W[jl];B[kl];W[kk];B[lk];W[jk]
;B[ll];W[mi];B[mj]C[At this point I don't think I can do anymore than just extend very directly from the stones/groups I already have - is this wrong/too passive. Also, are there points when I should have ignored big moves from white to make equally big moves myself, rather than just defending?]
