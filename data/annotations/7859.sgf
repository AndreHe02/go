C[Hello!

I am Sandal and I would first like to thank you for reviewing this game. This is a game which I lost by 0.5 points. I chose it because I think it illustrates both my strengths and weaknesses as a player.  I littered the sgf with some of my thoughts on how the game progressed.

I hope you enjoy your review!

Hi I'm LibraryEx (3k KGS) your reviewer. Bear in mind that my comments are not solid facts, merely my opinions. Do clarify any doubts with me or your friends so that you learn better, rather than taking in my comments blindly.]

I'd prefer playing F3 or something like that, but your idea of preventing a white moyo at the bottom is correct, cuz the 2 black stones at the top are still light and escaping is not of great importance.]

;B[pb];W[mb];B[oe];W[nc];B[mc];W[gj]C[My groups are settled, white is wide open everywhere, and it feels like I need to invade. What followed in the game is a complete failure to do so. I think that I made the mistake of playing where white is strong i.e. reducing the middle group. Perhaps a more subtle invasion on the bottom, or somewhere in the middle would have been better. Can you see any way to use the aji of the isolated two black stones? Middle game is my weakest skill I think. I would love to hear your thoughts on this situation.

too many possbilities, so its hard to see whats good and whats not. i might play J3, which aims at an invasion at the solid corner and making territory at the bottom together with O2. a play around N9 might also be possible, but risky.playing S13, S9, Q9 etc and trying for life is also possible.]
