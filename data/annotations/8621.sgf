Tami: Hi, I`m a 1k on KGS. I`ll do my best with this, but please remember that I also have a lot to learn.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp]C[Tami: There's a slight drawback to this move, as the next few moves show.]
;B[oc];W[pj]C[Tami: Of course, White doesn't want to permit you an extension in front of the enclosure. By playing here, though, White leaves you the option to approach at the bottom.]
(;B[oq]TR[pj]C[-- This stone feels awkward to me, but I played this because I prefer it to R12, P4

Tami: I think you were right to approach, but it should have been at O3 instead.

Do you know the Kobayashi Fuseki? It uses a similar layout to the White stones on R4 and Q10. The idea is that the marked stone allows the Kobayashi player to take territory while attacking. My variation shows how it works in this position.]
(;W[po]C[Tami: I think this is the wrong direction.];B[lq]C[-- I wanted to settle myself quickly to negate the influence of the D4 stone here, but I'm not sure this was the best plan

Tami: Making a base for unsettled groups is usually urgent, and so I think your decision was good.]
;W[cf]C[-- I certainly should have responded here, though I don't know the best way

Tami: How about a pincer? Also, a simple one-point jump to F16 can't be bad.]
(;B[qq]C[Tami: This is definitely a mistake, I believe.

Both the White and Black groups are stable, and it is small to play near living or stable groups. A common admonition in Japanese go books is to "move near weak groups" - in other words, the biggest places to play are to make your weak groups strong or to harass the opponent's.]
;W[fc]C[Tami: As White is quite strong in the lower right, it was easy to ignore your attachment and make a second approach here.]
;B[ee]
(;W[bd]C[Tami: Normal is the 3-3 invasion.];B[cc];W[ic]TR[bd]
[cf]C[Tami: The marked group lacks a proper base, so you should attack it. As your own group is not as strong as it could be, probably you should use a forcing move first to improve its strength.]
(;B[qh]C[Tami: There are weak stones for both sides in the top left, so that should be the priority.]
;W[qi]C[Tami: A bit vulgar.]
(;B[oh]C[Tami: Too loose. The simple stretch is slower, but rock solid.]
;W[np]C[Tami: I like White's move. It defends the side indirectly.]
;B[nq];W[lp];B[kp];W[lo];B[fq]C[Tami: I like the idea, but the tactics are wrong because White can cut through.]
(;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[ec]C[-- I felt like these stones could be pushed around if I didn't settle them

Tami: The two-space extension is not that strong, so you shouldn't force White to strengthen it. When you play here, you give the chance to attack later.]
(;W[fe];B[bc];W[ce]C[Tami: This is so small.]

Tami: Actually, I think this move is also okay. The shape is good and you defend the cut at G15/H14.]
;W[jg]
(;B[lg]C[Tami: An important fundamental is "Don't surround territory!". This move is completely passive - it does nothing to add to your potential.]
;W[ji]C[Tami: White must have been very happy to get out of the snare!]

My advice when playing out a complicated semeai is to SLOW DOWN! Read it out carefully. I know that's easier said than done, because semeai can be exciting, but it's the way to win `em.]

Tami: I hope you found my remarks helpful. I suggest sticking to this order in the fuseki: corners, enclosures or approaches, extensions, centre and only deviating if a group's base is threatened. Later, you will come to appreciate urgent shape points better. Also - don't be passive. If you surround territory instead of expanding your area, you`ll end up boxed up, and your territory will be shrunk as the endgame wears on. As everybody recommends, do lots of Life and Death problems - this will give you a very good idea of when to defend and when to attack. Good luck in your go for 2012 and beyond!]

(;B[dl]C[-- This may have been a better choice

Tami: The game should be beyond retrieval, but below dan strength it's probably worth continuing because many a won game has been squandered. On the other hand, even if it's a way to increase your winning percentage by a few points, I'm not sure how I feel about doggedly playing on in resignable positions. Maybe a sign of getting stronger will be the way you time your resignations. Personally, I think the best and most honourable way is to try and engineer complications, and once you've used up the last reasonable attempt at "shaking" the game, resign. Still, the decision to resign is yours and yours alone. White is leading a lot, but only won by komi in the end, so you must have played the endgame better.]
