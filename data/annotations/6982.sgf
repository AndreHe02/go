C[Thank you for taking the time to review my game.

I went through your game, and the general impression I got was that you tend to play too safe most of the time. Also ome of your moves do not improve the situation.

In this game black and white both made mistake. It wasn't just because of the top-right corner that you lost; you just made a few more mistakes than your opponent.

Advice:
- take more risks! the otherperson also has holes in his defense, don't focus all your energy on protecting your own groups.
- practice your reading skills by doing life and death problems (lots of them avaiable on the Internet)
- play a little faster than you usually do to gradually improve your reading spead

Regards,
Arne

PS. I can't delete the variations I tried, it's a problem with CGoban3, sorry for the mess.

Never go walking so far from the side. A 3 to 5 line exchange is reasonable but nothing more than that.]
