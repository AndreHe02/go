C[Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to review! This was just about my 100th game of Go. I'm the black player.

k: if you have questions about my review, please feel free to contact me.]

;W[pp]C[I am not sure what my opponent is doing];B[op]C[I was thinking, "if white cuts at p3, I bet I can capture his q4 group." I didn't have a chance to read this carefully during the game.]

(;W[qq];B[oq];W[ro];B[rn]C[I thought, " I will trade him the corner in exchange for thickness toward the top and left sides. his stones at r7 and o3 will be in major trouble"]
;W[rp];B[qn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]
(;B[om]C[I thought, "I don't want to give his r7 stone a chance to run"
I wonder whether this is a good move. perhaps it's unnecessary to capture his r7 stone -- perhaps I could profit while chasing if he chose to run.

k: B did a good job of containing W, B was able to get more potential than W,  see variation]
;W[sn];B[rm];W[sm]
(;B[rl]C[I probably could've played at t8, but I wanted to leave less aji on the right side. In retrospect I feel this was unnecessary.

k: agreed, see variation, but W did not gain anything, was not good for W]
;W[sl];B[sk];W[so];B[rj];W[os];B[ns];W[ps];B[nr];W[cj]
(;B[jj]C[To my newbie eyes, this position is favorable for black. We both have two large-looking size, but I have a bunch of thickness in the bottom right

I wasn't sure what to do here. I wanted to take advantage of my thickness somehow. I decided to play k10 thinking, "Maybe this moyo will be so large that he has to invade, allowing me to attack his invasion by using my thickness. Additionally, the tengen point could be helpful for launching an invasion/reduction of his left or top sides." I'm new to such thinking, so I'm quite unsure of my reasoning.

k: getting a large moyo is not likely as someone gets to single digit kyu ranking. W has many stones on the 4th line, it is a good time to get under them. see variation]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[oc]
(;B[qd]C[k: see variation];W[go]C[k: this hurt B, great move W, see variation at move 43]
;B[hp]C[I'm quite uncertain of this move. My intention was to protect the bottom side.

k: nice response]
(;W[nf]C[I was surprised by his move. it feels quite large -- both expanding his top side and invading my center moyo. (are both those 
things true? is this a big move?)

k: this is an example of how hard it is to protect a big moyo, see variation of bigger problems]
;B[nh]C[I was thinking, "I'll defend my center"];W[in]
(;B[kn]C[I considered cutting his knight's move, but as far as I could read, it didn't look favorable. I opted to try to prevent further encroachment into my center, and to expand my bottom side.

I don't feel at all confident of this move. perhaps I could've attacked his left side instead, aiming to make cutting at h6 favorable for me.

k: not many points in the the center, better to reduce W, see variation]
;W[cc];B[gd]C[I was thinking, "maybe I can invade his top side." I have no idea if this invasion is favorable for me or not.

k: i like this move, it sets up the invasion at m16];W[ge]C[I was surprised by his attachment]
;B[hd];W[fd]C[I was surprised by this hane. I was expecting h15 -- then I would've had to live inside his top side, or sacrifice the stones. I was uncertain if I would be able to live or not in the event of h15. I tried playing out a couple variations afterwards, but I'm still not sure.]

(;B[ie]C[I thought, "ahh, run!"

k: see variations, but not as good as your setup to move 67]
;W[fc];B[ig];W[gg];B[kf]C[I sought to prevent reduction of my center moyo while threatening to attack his k16 stone]

(;W[ic]C[k: see variation for W];B[ld]C[I thought, "maybe I can further invade the top side, while pressuring his k16 group"]
;W[lc]
(;B[md]C[k: these moves make W stronger, and secures territory for W, B should avoid making W stronger]
;W[mc]
(;B[gj]C[I thought, "maybe I can expand my center moyo and reduce / threaten to invade his left side"

I wonder if I could've gotten away with F10 here

k: see variation, this is the last set of variations, you played an execellent game for your rank, and only 100 games. Hopefully these variations will give you some new ideas, to take you up to 10k. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Keep up the great work.]
