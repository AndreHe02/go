C[Dear reviewer,

this is a tournament game I played against a 3d recently. I made a huge blunder early on and fought hard to come back, but finally had to resign. I was behind most of the time so I tried to force the game back my way, that's why I played some "dangerous" moves.

I'm not sure if there is much to review actually, but please have a look, and point out the mistakes I made.

Thank you very much for your time.

[kb\]: Hi Mafutrct,
Usually games where we make huge blunders are not good games to review, since we know what we did wrong.  Try to submit closer games next time.

[kb\]: Approaching a corner is almost always a first-class move.  This and A are the correct points.]
;W[dg];B[gd]C[i felt this was a better direction than f15. i know the usual joseki is a bit weird, but i thought i'd try it.]
;W[ee]C[this move should be bad. how to punish? does it depend on the ladder?

[kb\]: Yes - cut the other direction.]

;B[fd];W[df]C[[kb\]: I am afraid that the game is now not in your favor.]
;B[ce];W[ff];B[lo];W[bd];B[eg]C[i figured i'd play f13 and h14 to sacrifice, then hope the moyo on the right compensates for the terrible local result.

[kb\]: Better to leave it completely now and follow through, but your ladder breaker is still much too small.]

;W[hd];B[id];W[hc];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb];W[hb];B[pf]C[what do you think about this situation?

[kb\]: game over.  White has about 80 points already and Black has about 50 + influence.  Black is down about 20 points.]
;W[pc];B[qc]C[i thought this is better than p17, because i can fix the cuts while attacking white.
