(;W[de]LB[cf:B][cn:A]C[I find it hard to grasp a solid understanding of the opening and wonder if this is a reasonable move.

This is fine. You can also play at A or B.];B[cg]
(;W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[gc]
(;W[bb];B[jc]TR[bb][cc][cd][de]C[This is a  very interesting position.

If I were W my thinking would turn around the safety of the marked W group.

If you look at the variation black ends by playing at K17, W gets sente and his group is strong.

But after this move the B group on top is stable which means the marked W group is weaker than before this move.

So, if I were W I would strengthen my marked group.
I believe the balance of stability between these groups is the most important issue on the board at this time.]

(;W[cn]C[My opponent pointed out this move after the game as a pretty clear mistake. White should pincer the C13 stone, and then extend downwards if black jumps out.]

(;B[cj]C[Black puts another nail into the coffin of your upper left group.]

(;W[fq]C[Very bad.

Let's forget about the weak group in the upper left and focus on the local situation.

You are in B's sphere of influence. Before this move he has 5 stones in this part of the board and you have 1. That means you don't want to start a fight. The only move is to go into the corner. 

Now B must choose his followup based on the top left.]
(;B[cq]C[White is still OK according to CrazyStone.

A terrible choice by B.
CrazyStone is only considering the local corner.]

(;B[em]LB[dk:A]C[I think whatever you gained by this move is offset by the damage the exchange has done to any chances you haad for a play at A.]

(;W[il];B[jl]LB[ik:A][jk:B]TR[il]C[If you can't follow up with A or B then you shouldn't play the marked stone.]
