C[zdli2002 [2d\]: hi
Buster [1d\]: hi gg

Dear reviewer,

First of all, many thanks for reviewing this game.
In this game i played but, if possible, i would like a review for both sides.
It seems to me that this game became ultra-violent from the very begenning, and quite complicated (for me)

Thx again,

Thomas

JS: Hi, my name is JÃ¼rgen and I also play on KGS (Juergonaut). I hope my point of view of this game can be helpfull for you.]
;B[qe];W[pn];B[ec];W[dn];B[pq];W[np]C[JS: First of all, this move by White is a little bit strange. I also haven't seen it. So the first thing one should always consider in a local position is: Has the opponent severe followups, or can you tenuki to play somewhere else. Mostly strange moves look strong at the first point, but they lack a followup, so in a lot of positions it is good to just tenuki and play somwhere else.

However, I have found a transposition from another hoshi tenuki joseki.]

JS: This move is a good chance for black to become a little bit more active. Usually splitting not so strong groups of the opponent is a good way to forestall big frameworks by the opponent.]

(;B[di]LB[bm:A]TR[cn][dn][en][bo][co]C[A bit too far ?

JS: Beside extending your cutting stone it is very important to know where the important and big parts of the board are.

Just look at the marked white wall and the two black marked stones. If white makes an extension around where you have played this move, black could always slip inside this territory around A. So it is not important for white to play there. Therefore this is also a reason for Black not to play there. If something is not important for your opponent, you are in no hurry to get it!]

(;B[bh]C[I wanted to be able to connect to my c16 stone if needed, but now i wonder maybe it's too slow

JS: The last few moves played not good, just strengthening black all over the left side. What is important now is to feel the balance of the acual position. Black has roughly 3 1/2 corners and is ahead in terms of fix territory, but the influence of white should should not be underestimated. So instead of increasing the territory black should think about softly earasing what might could become a big white moyo.

Note that this move is on the second line. This seems like you make an excuse to you opponent.]

C[zdli2002 [2d\]: I have to go, sorry
Buster [1d\]: well, thx anyway

My opponent had to go, so he resigned here. However, even now i can't find a good answer to his last move.

JS: I think, that if you connect all your stones with the (ugly :-)) empty triangly at A, you should have no problems to live. I think that just now the score is very even.

So I hope my review helped you. See you on KGS :-).])

(;B[pj]C[JS: Regardless, of wheather you can kill the left or not, this is the best way for black to win this game.

But winning a won game is quite hard when the clock is ticking next to you :-).]

(;B[bm]C[JS: This move connects too without having to worry so much about shortage of liberties.]

(;B[fh]C[JS: Maybe I would play somthing like this lightly cover the cut on the outside.]

(;B[gn]C[JS: Out of selfrespect, extending is the only possible move now. This stone is a cutting stones which makes it very important]
))
(;B[gn]LB[ho:A]C[JS: You should not let your cuttung stone become weak, otherwise cutting was worthless. If white tenukis now black would have a good followup at A threatening a throw in and devasting the whole white wall on the right. The lower left corner is not so important now because it is already alive. All moves which you make adiddionally are just wort points, but strengthen the opponent on the outside.]
))
(;B[dp]LB[eo:A][fr:B]C[JS: The general Idea of this move is to make miai of splitting the white groups at A and sliding under the white framework at B. The important thing is that black doesn't strengthen white in any way more than neccessary.]

(;B[pp];W[nn];B[nr]C[JS: This is playable for black. Note that black didn't make some exchanges which he normally didn't want to make as in the game.]
