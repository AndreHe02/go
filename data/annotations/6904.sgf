AB[pd][dp]C[iSoma: This game I played on IGS a couple months ago ten minutes byoyomi, and I was wondering if I played really this strong or yamashita just too gentle. I was really surprized to win this game. Contrary to other games, I played very calm and with only a few emotions. Thanks for taking the time to look into it.

Alex: You played a good solid game with no major errors, much better than expected for a 10k rank!  I do think white missed a couple of chances to attack strongly--but maybe this was deliberate, to give you the chance to play an endgame.

In general you can improve by thinking more about sente, and trying to avoid "slow" moves--look for plays that put pressure on the opponent or try to do two things at once.  I've pointed out some examples in this review.  Also, I think you are now at the stage where you can benefit by studying some joseki: you made two clear joseki errors in the first twenty moves.

Your opponent in this game is probably a bit stronger than me, so please don't trust my comments too much!  But I hope I can mention some ideas that are helpful for you.]

[ed:C]C[iSoma: I think this move is the more agressive to A . But invites to W play B?

Alex: Right, F16 is a mistake, because white has a good attack at B17.  You should play either 'A' or 'C' (E16).]
;W[cj];B[cm]LB[cl:a][ch:b]C[iSoma: Somehow I thought stealing White C7 would be good here.

Alex: It's a good idea--but C7 doesn't have a big effect on white.  I think 'a' (C8) would be better instead, aiming to invade at 'b' (C12).]
;W[qf]
(;B[pj]LB[nd:a][nc:b][qh:c][pi:d]C[iSoma: I dont like to play againt big frameworks. Wasnt thinking much for this move.

Alex: Personally I don't like this move, because it tries to make influence--but the white stone at Q4 will neutralise any thickness that you make.  Instead I would choose one of 'a' (O16), 'b' (O17), 'c' (R12) or maybe 'd' (Q11).  See variation for an example.]
;W[nc]C[iSoma: As expected.];B[oe];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[oc]LB[md:A]C[iSoma: Don't now many josekis well. Played fast, wasnt really sure if thats possible, but wanted to keep pressure. A better according to joseki?

Alex: Yes, this is a bad mistake--either N16 or N15 would be better--take a look at the variation.]
;W[ob];B[od];W[mb];B[pg];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
(;B[rf]C[Alex: Here is an example of a slow move.  This is the type of move that you should save for the endgame--it's only a few points, not important this early in the game.  See the variation.]
;W[hc]
(;B[jd]LB[fc:a]C[iSoma: Thought I already have to corner, so it might good too press here.

Alex: No, attacking the H17 stone won't work well, because your corner shape is too weak.  You should play 'a' (F17) instead--see the variation.]
;W[ec]
(;B[eb]LB[ed:a]C[Alex: Right.  You'd like to play 'a' (E16) instead, but it doesn't work (variation).]
;W[fc];B[fb];W[gc]
(;B[jp]TR[pj]C[iSoma: I was willing to sacrifize F16. Wasnt really sure if this K4 move is any good.

Alex: K4 is not bad, but my preference is for R6 instead.  The reason is that you already played a high move at Q10, so the shape is incomplete--you want to turn the right side into a framework.]
;W[qm]
(;B[nq]C[iSoma: I thought i was thick enough at top right. So give K4 some sense.

Alex: Good idea.  Maybe you could think abut R3 instead--see variation--it's hard to decide which way is better.]
;W[pq];B[fq]TR[dp][cm]LB[cq:a][eq:b]C[Alex: The three stones D4-C7-F3 make an awkward shape: white can still invade at 'a' (C3).  Maybe you should play 'b' (E3) instead.]
;W[lq]
(;B[no]LB[nr:a]C[iSoma: I thought it might not be too bad to extend here.

Alex: The problem with this move is that you can't really attack the white stone: white can always play 'a' (O2) to connect.  So maybe you should consider attaching on top--see the variation.]
;W[lo];B[nm];W[jr];B[iq]LB[lm:a]C[Alex: This is a very slow move: you can't make much territory in that area.  Maybe 'a' (M7) instead?]
;W[ir];B[jn]C[iSoma: I thought pushing to center is bigger than defending at bottom.

Alex: Yes.  But I still prefer M7.];W[lm]
(;B[pr]LB[qo:a][or:b]C[Alex: This is "aji-keshi" (spoiling your potential)--you make white's corner stronger.  If you leave the corner alone, then later you might have a chance to invade at 'a' (R5).

Also, this move is gote for you.  If you really want to play in this area, 'b' (P2) is a better move--see variation.]
;W[qr];B[or];W[hq]LB[cq:a]C[Alex: I think this is a mistake by white, as black's corner ends up strong--white loses the chance to invade at 'a' (C3) (another example of aji-keshi).]
;B[hp];W[gq];B[gp];W[fr];B[er];W[gr];B[ep]LB[dr:a]C[iSoma: F4 better?

Alex: I'm not sure--it's hard to decide.  I think this way is probably better--if you play F4 instead, then white might be able to clamp at 'a' (D2) later.]
;W[rj]
(;B[qi]LB[dk:a][rk:b]C[Alex: This is another slow move, defending only a small amount of territory.  Maybe 'a' (D9) instead?

If you do want to defend this area, 'b' (S9) is better, as it keeps sente--see variation.]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[qj];B[pi];W[ej]C[iSoma: W is getting big...]

(;B[el]C[Alex: I think this is too defensive.  Maybe G10 instead?  See variations.]
;W[fk]
(;B[ff]C[iSoma: I thought if W plays around H14 he's getting to big.

Alex: True, but this move is going in too deep.  I think you were lucky that white didn't attack strongly...  Instead, maybe you should play at J13 (variation).]
;W[ge];B[fi]C[Alex: Good move!];W[fe]LB[ij:a]C[Alex: I think this is a mistake by white (too slow!)--if 'a' (J10) instead, black could end up in big trouble.]
;B[di]LB[ii:a]C[iSoma: I wanted to play sabaki here. Dunno if really possible. Played fast.

Alex: This is very risky!  Again I don't think white found the best way to attack.  I would play 'a' (J11) instead.]

(;W[ci]C[Alex: White could play D10 instead to start a large scale fight--see variation.]

;B[dm];W[bl];B[bm];W[bk];B[gh]C[iSoma: I believed in a chance.

Alex: This is a thin shape--your three stones at D11 are likely to get captured anyway--but you have no choice.]
;W[hj];B[ih]C[iSoma: Run... :)

Alex: Yes, it's the only way now!];W[jj];B[ki]C[Alex: Good move.]
;W[kj];B[li];W[lj]
(;B[pn]C[iSoma: O17 felt strong but I wanted to help O5 group.

Alex: I wonder if Q9 is better--see variation.];W[qn]
(;B[pm]C[Alex: Q5 is better, because it keeps sente--white must reply (see variation).]
;W[pk];B[ok];W[pl];B[ol];W[po];B[oo];W[mn];B[ll]C[Alex: Good move.  (You didn't play O6, because it would be too slow, right?)]
;W[kl];B[mj];W[ml];B[md];W[hg]
(;B[ii]C[iSoma: Too easy? Don't know really.

Alex: It's a nice idea, but here I think H12 is better, as it makes it more difficult for white to capture the D11 stones.  See variation.  Therefore I think white H13 is a mistake.]
;W[ei];B[eh];W[gi];B[hh];W[fh];B[fg]
(;W[eg]C[Alex: I don't understand why white didn't play F11 (variation).]
;B[fi];W[dd];B[cc];W[fh]
(;B[if]C[iSoma: Didnt really know if that exchange was so good for me but i didnt liked W to enter my territory rather than bring 4 stones alive.

Alex: I think this is OK, but maybe you can play 'a' (R1) first--it's sente (white must reply)--see variation.]

(;B[id]LB[hl:a][qs:b]C[iSoma: H17 bigger?

Alex: You mean H7?  Yes.  Actually, 'a' (H8) is even bigger.  And 'b' (R1).]

This is my last comment. Thanks.
