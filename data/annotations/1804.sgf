C[This game commented March 7, 2002 by steve@carderfamily.net.
Be sure to look at any variations I have added.];B[pd];W[qp]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[oq];W[po];B[no];W[qk]TR[qm]SQ[kp]C[Was this a big enough jump, or should I have threatened the upper
right?

I think this is an appropriate jump.  Any farther and Black can
easily invade around the space marked with the triangle.  This
would leave the two corner white stones without much eye space.
Also,
Black's stones are still vulnerable to a White play around the
square.  So, overall, this play makes White's corner stones stable
and leaves Black with more vulnerable corner stones];B[qh]SQ[jp]
[cf][fc]C[This is not the best move for Black.  This does not secure the
upper right corner and does  not secure much side space.  The
squares are all better moves for Black at this early stage in
the game.];W[hd]TR[fc][cc]SQ[cn][fq][nc]C[This is not the best move for White.  This does not secure the
upper side and corner since Black could invade at either of the
triangles.  The squares are all worth more for White at this
early stage.

See the variations for example invasion at each of the triangles.]

(;B[kc]C[See variations.];W[ch]SQ[fq][cn]C[Same question

This still does not secure the corner well and is not worth as
much as an approach move on the lower left corner.];B[ck]SQ[cn]
[nc]C[Black's last two moves seem to be "asking" for a game with lots
of fighting.  These moves look "ripe" for invasions at the squares.]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[lp]TR[jp]SQ[lq][kp]C[This is a bit too close to Black.  I think either of the squares
would be better.  White's current move would in trouble if Black
played at the triangle.
See variation for a better Black response.]
(;B[lq];W[kq];B[mq];W[kp];B[qq];W[pq]C[This move doesn't accomplish much.  This is fine if White wants
to make a ko here.  But since White plans to just connect, the
move only forces Black to secure the corner without adding to
White's territory.  At best, this is an endgame move.];B[pr]
C[See the variation for another White response.]
(;W[pp];B[rq];W[sp]SQ[rp]C[Playing at the square gives a more secure connection.]
;B[cq]
(;W[md]SQ[pd][kc]C[This isn't really an invasion.  Imagine a line between Black's
marked stones.  Any play inside that line is an invasion and
any play outside of that line is at best a reducing move.  White's
current move will allow Black to make secure territory while
White builds a wall facing the center.  This wall may possible
result in some territory for White later, but Black's corner
is definately territory now.

A real invasion would accomplish more.  See the variation.]
;B[nc];W[ke];B[mc]C[Black is securing the corner and upper right side while White
isn't even making a solid wall in the center.];W[ib];B[cc];W[cd]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[bd];W[be];B[ac];W[db]SQ[eb]C[This is not a good move.  If White plays at the square now, Black
will have to play at White 40.  This will be Sente for White.
If White plays the current move, White will eventiually have
to make a connection at the square in Gote.  At this point in
the game, Sente is worth more than the small territory reduction
for Black.];B[cb]SQ[eb]C[Remember this shape.  White will always have to connect at the
square when this shape arises.];W[da];B[ca];W[bb]C[I should have connected instead.]
;B[eb];W[bc];B[ea];W[ad]C[Over all, this was not a bad trade for White.  Losing the two
stones at the top was still a mistake, however.];B[fc];W[ed]
;B[gb];W[fd];B[hc];W[ic]C[White now has a solid wall and Black's territory at the top left
is small.];B[fo]C[I missed this opportunity.];W[hp]C[Good response.]
;B[mf];W[kg];B[fk];W[fh]C[I guess the bottom is in more danger, hm?]
;B[hn]SQ[dr][kr][pm]C[The squares are all good moves to secure White's groups.  Black's
last move doesn't really threaten White's lower side group and
doesn't expand Black's center.  Essentially, Black's move is
a waste and White can use the "free move" to secure his groups.]
;W[jn];B[jl];W[hk];B[hl];W[hi];B[nk]SQ[qm]C[This move threatens to invade at the square and isolate the white
stone on the side.  White should respond by securing the side
group.];W[mh]C[See the variation for an example invasion of White's side group.]

(;B[of];W[oh]SQ[lb][kr][pm][ji]C[This doesn't really attack Black and doesn't really add to White's
territory.  The squares are all worth more.];B[nm]SQ[pm]C[Now White REALLY needs to play at the square.]
;W[pi];B[pg];W[kj];B[ll];W[ln];B[pm]SQ[po][qk]C[Black has played a reducing move since this is not inside the
imaginary line between White's marked stones.  This move will
allow White to secure the side group without any danger.  An
actual invasion would be much better for Black.];W[qm];B[qc]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[ok];B[oj];W[pj];B[mj];W[li];B[qi];W[qj];B[rj]
;W[rk]SQ[ri]C[This is the same pattern as White's move on the left top.  Black
will have to connect and so this move is Gote.   A Black play
at the square instead would be Sente.];B[si];W[pn];B[om]
(;W[ej]SQ[lb][dr][kr]C[I'm sure there's a better move I could have played.

Correct.  All this really does is make Black secure his territory.
The squares are all better moves.  See the two variations for
some ways to reduce Black's top territory.];B[ek];W[dj];B[cj]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[cl];B[bl];W[el];B[cm];W[fl];B[gl];W[gk];B[em]
;W[fj]C[This was a nice exchange for White.];B[fm];W[go]SQ[er]
[io][ld][le][jd][bh]C[Another small (vulgar?) move.

The moves I noted earlier are still worth more.  This is probably
Sente, since Black is likely to respond, so it is not too bad.
Black should really ignore it, however, and play on one of the
squares.];B[gn];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[eo];W[er];B[dq];W[es]SQ[lb]
[bi][me][cs]C[This is a small endgame move.  You don't need to completely seal
off the area yet since there are still bigger moves on the board.
All of the squares are better choices.];B[dr];W[im];B[il];W[ml]
C[Playing inside Black's group here will just let him solidify
this section of territory.];B[mm]C[Now I should let the sacrifice go.]
;W[mk]C[But I don't have the coolest head in the world.];B[lk]
;W[kk];B[kl];W[lm]SQ[mk][ml]C[Right now the score is fairly even.  This move by White doesn't
serve any useful purpose.  It looks like it cuts two groups apart,
but only until Black captures the two marked stones.  Even if
it really did cut the groups apart, they are both strong, so
cutting them serves no purpose.  This move gave Sente to Black
and allowed him to push in and cut off a lot of White territory.
This move was probably made quickly with only a brief look at
the stones close by.  This stone, however, turns out to be
a major turning point in the game.  There is probably some philosophical
lesson here, but we will stick to Go for now.];B[ci]
(;W[di]SQ[bh]C[The square is better.  See the variation.];B[bh]
;W[cg]SQ[bg]C[This is better than playing at the square.];B[bg]
;W[bf];B[gd];W[ge];B[gc];W[he]C[This connection is a good idea.  White is not really behind and
so should not leave cutting points.  If White was losing badly,
he could skip this move for some desperate attack elsewhere.]
;B[jd]
(;W[je]C[Should have connected.

Correct.  See the variation];B[id];W[kd];B[jc]
(;W[ha]C[A waste of stones. Ignore alternate route.];B[ga];W[ba]
SQ[me][lr][ik]C[This is another small endgame move.  White should take Sente
and do something bigger.  The squares are all worth more.];B[le]

(;W[lf]SQ[ld]C[White should connect at the square.  See variation.]
;B[ld];W[mg];B[ne];W[ng]SQ[nh]C[Is this really the best move?  It probably surrounds one point
of territory at the square.  Later, pushing up one space may
reduce Black's score by one point.  But that requires another
stone.  So, this move is worth only 1 point by itself and it
is Gote.  White should only play this if there are no more moves
worth more than one point AND no more Sente moves.];B[gq];W[gp]

;W[in];B[ho];W[jo];B[hs];W[gs];B[is]SQ[np]C[This whole exchange at the bottom didn't actually change the
score from the time Black played the marked stone.  So, it didn't
hurt White, but it didn't help either.  Most advance players
would not have bothered to do this, knowing that there would
be no benefit.  In this case, however, it is probably worth the
effort since Black might make a mistake.  Of course, White could
be the one to make the mistake.];W[gr]C[This connection is unnecessary.  The White group has two eyes
already so Black can't hurt it.];B[ds]

reasonably.  In a Dan level game, it would be insulting for White
to play this way since it implies that White expects Black to

respond incorrectly and let White capture something.  So it is
