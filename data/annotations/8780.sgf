C[* Hello,

* My name is Litost, and I'll be your reviewer. I play as 2d on KGS and Tygem. I hope you will enjoy the review; do not hesitate to contact me if you have any question. All my comments will start with a star (*).

* My advice based on this game analysis:
- Take your time. Refrain from attacking if you have weak groups. Find ways to reinforce them while maintaining pressure.
- Think about your shapes. Do not leave cutting points if you can avoid it. Peeping points may be unavoidable, but keep them in mind.
- Do some tsumego problems with connect-and-die patterns.];B[pd]

;W[cd]C[* Black c17 looks passive. As white, I would play F16 immediately, so as to seal black in the corner.]
;B[bc];W[fd]C[* Very good. You must have been quit happy here :)]
;B[ec]
(;W[ed]TR[gd]C[* This looks solid, but I am a bit concerned about the shape here, because White leaves a cutting point at G16.]
;B[cn];W[fq]C[* This feels like the wrong direction. White has influence at the top, so I would prefer a pincer, either C8 or D8.]
;B[ck]
(;W[bp]C[* This is big, but this also induces the black C12 extension, which 1) helps black's group on the left and 2) damages the white group at the top.]
;B[ch]LB[dh:C][ci:F][di:D][ei:E][cj:B][dj:A]C[* White's base is suddently reduced. White also has to be careful about the G16 cut. Overall, this is a good result for black.

* White can still play D10 later (the A-F) sequence to improve his influence, but this should be done in a good timing.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[* Good pincer. Black is slowly putting pressure on the G16 cut.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rc]
(;B[me]C[* This is a  bit  loose.];W[re];B[rd]C[* There is no need to push for Black. This removes one liberty for his group.]
;W[sd];B[qg];W[qf]C[* As white, you have already reduced the territory, so I think it would be a good timing to play elsewhere (maybe you could use the aji here later, when the situation develops in the center).]
;B[pf];W[pg]
(;B[qe]C[* This is bad shape. Black should just extend.];W[rf]
;B[rg];W[of];B[pe];W[se]
(;B[og]C[* Bad cut. Black should atari from the other side.]
;W[ph];B[nf];W[rh]C[* This is a very good result for white.]
;B[qn]C[* This is a normal move, reducing white's influence and making territory, but  maybe too shy. The white group at the top left is not safe, and it is urgent to attack it. Black could gain a lot, either at the top or in the center.]
(;W[en]LB[ld:B][he:A]TR[ef][lf][mg][iq][mq]C[* This is an important point in the game, so let's make a count and try to devise the best strategy for white.

* In terms of territory, both players have about 30 points. The balance of territory is equal (white leads by the komi).

* In terms of power, black has a bit of potential in the center (the o14 group has sme influence), and on the lower right (aiming at N3/N5). White would like to assert some territory at the bottom (around j3), but has a weak group on the top left, so could get in trouble quite fast.

* As white, I would therefore probably play on the top left, trying to reinforce the shape, while offsetting the black influence in the center. If black takes N3, then I can lean on the black group on the left and gain more influence on the center (L4 would shine, helping me to assert territory on the center, while reducing black's potential on the right).

* H15 shows the general idea, but is not dynamic enough. I would probably try to exploit the M16 cut.]
;B[ip]CR[kn]SQ[el][in][nq]C[I think dealing with this invasion was the determining factor in the game.  The way it worked out was terrible for me, as I was pushed against black's low stones to the left without any real compensation.  I wasn't too happy with moves 17-21, which led to black's stones there (I should have played 18 at C8), but that is a simpler problem.  I would love your thoughts on how to deal with this situation.

I've marked a few possible alternatives for move 50 and 52.

For move 50:
J6 could get pretty complicated, but in a way it keeps B from using the low stones on the left as easily because of my stone at E6.  It risks weakness for L4 though.  O3 and E8 seem too passive too me, but I would probably favor O3 between the two because it gives me a reasonable group on that side.  I guess the tricky thing about this situation is that there isn't a clear weakness for B other than the J4 stone, so it's hard for me to see where to get compensation for the invasion.


* J4 is pretty normal, and it looks like it will be difficult to capture. As white, I would probably settle for O3, making a base and gaining some outside support for further invasion of the black corner enclosure (with some external support, most enclosures can be invaded).

* If you do not like O3, then you could also consider probing the corner enclosure first - either you get the corner if black decides for outside influence (L4 being high means it can then be treated lightly), or either you manage to lean on the corner, reinforcing L4  easily and then being able to attack J4 more efficiently.

* J6 is too agressive. L4 is too weak for you to get something good out of the attack.]
(;W[kn]C[* Reinforcing L4 is all good, but this also induces a reinforcement for black, which is bad. I think it's better to leave J4 alone for now, and simply try and reinfore in sente. O3 or corner probes, as discussed before.]
;B[in]CR[il]TR[cm]SQ[el][kl][nq]C[Again O3 and E8 are attractive, but seem too passive.  In retrospect it seems clear I can't allow B to push me to the left, so perhaps E8 is the move.

I also contemplated C7 in order to build thickness on the left, but the timing seemed wrong.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  Thanks very much for the review!

* I see two ways to exploit the left side: eiher you lean on it, then push the black group towards the influence, or you push the black group right away (as in the game), obtain a splitting attack and use it to invade the black formation at the left.

* When I mean invasion, I mean a move on a second line. If you can get support in the center, then an invasion on the second line can be devastating.]
(;W[il]C[* This leaves a big weakness at K7.];B[hm];W[hl]C[* Contact moves should be for defense (because they help reinforce both groups, the attacker as well as the defender). When attacking, consider attacking from distance first (keima and boshi are standard moves, ogeima and kosumi come next).]
;B[fm];W[em]C[* White is pushing from behind, but in that case the influence gained can be used to invade the left side, so it is not so bad.]
;B[gl];W[gk];B[fk];W[el];B[fl];W[ek];B[gj];W[nq]C[* We come back to your original problem: at first sight, your attack has succeeded (you can now invade the left side), but since you started with a weak group, you need to defend it first. This means that your attack was too hurried.]
;B[kq];W[lq];B[jq];W[lr]C[* This leaves a cutting point at M4.]
;B[ic]C[* The game is so shaky. Both players have weak groups, and both do not seem to care!]
(;W[hd]LB[ge:A]C[* This is too optimistic, and also leaves a big peeping point at A. White's group has no base at all, so you need to make shape. Think about attachments to start.]

(;B[oo]C[* So, where are we?

* Balance of territory: white has around 30 points, black has about 35, so with the komi the score is equal.

* White has 2 weak groups, black is fairly safe.

* Conclusion: Black leads the game. P5, reinforcing the side, is not bad and should be enough to win the game. Black could also be more agressive without taking much more risks, though.]
