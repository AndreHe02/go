C[Hi! Thanks for reviewing my game. This is one of those rare games where things actually end close, as opposed to my usual games where we end up killing each other and one of us resigns. As such, I wanted a review for this game

I was playing as White [W\] in this game

Please try and comment as much as possible. Even though I am rated 2k, I learnt Go mainly on KGS by myself and so it's very likely that there are some "basic things" that I don't know. Any advice, no matter how trivial, will be very helpful to me!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[cg];B[be];W[fd];B[fe]C[Not joseki.

How should I have handled it?

prana: just walk along the 4. line or even play hane on the 5. line]
(;W[cj];B[gd];W[fc];B[gc]C[prana: to get closed in like this is very painful.]
;W[ge]C[bad move? It was either this or let B have a nice, complete wall around my corner, which, as I was told, is bad

prana: it shows fighting spirit, but you have to be careful. D17 is not alive yet locally.]
;B[ff]C[what should W do now?];W[nc]SQ[gb][he]C[I wanted to check his direction of play before I decide whether to fight at H15 or settle at G18.

prana: since d17 is not yet alive, in my opinion it is overplay to install a second white group on the top.]
(;B[he]C[He wants influence, so I make a O17 secure group, right?

prana: the problem is, you have 2 weak groups...];W[gb];B[hb]
;W[fb]
(;B[gf]C[He didn't want me to exploit the ladder by playing Q6 sente. But IMO isn't G14 a little slow?

prana: yes, too slow. It is now easy to settle o17. Instead g14]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[A secure group, as mentioned.

prana: it seems, you know your opponent well ;-)];B[pj]C[This is the killer part.

I never figured out how to properly reduce these moyos. most of my games will end up with an invasion. How should W handle this moyo without invading? Or is an invasion unquestionably necessary?

prana: normal b move is Q14. So, you might pincer immediately.]
(;W[nq]C[I didn't know what to do, so rather than do anything reckless, I decided to just expand my bottom.

prana: also good.];B[qn];W[jq]LB[jp:A]TR[cj][dp][cq]SQ[lq][pr]
C[I was afraid of W Q2, B M3, giving black a nice base from which he can attack the bottom left. Hence I played K3. Are there any better josekis for such situations?

prana: as a rule of thumb, you should avoid the 2 low extions of the hoshi, because the b invasion on 3-3 point is favorable for w. Thus , you should play high on A.]
;B[bc]TR[cj]C[painful, but I didn't really have time to secure that corner.

prana: that is why c10 was a bad move.];W[cb];B[bb];W[eb]
(;B[ca]LB[jb:C][ic:A][jc:B]C[PRANA: this is very bad. The vital point is d19. 

But in order to kill, b has to forestall the connection with w g19 and w j18.
w has to answer moves like A, B or  C in the upper left corner, ...]
;W[da];B[ba];W[cc];B[ed];W[ec];B[cq];W[dq]C[3-3 joseki. Or is there a better way for W to play it?]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq]
TR[jp]C[prana: as you can see now, k3 would be better on the 4. line.]
;B[no]C[Now I'm really stumped. What should W do now?]
(;W[ln]C[prana: This is too thin, b can cut easily];B[lo];W[ko]
;B[lp];W[kn];B[kp];W[jp];B[lr];W[qq]C[My ace in a hole. Or is it too early to play this? Should W play O15 first? Or L10?

prana: if you manage to escape, it is ok. 
If you get caught, the game is over. So, your decision.];B[rp]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[qp];B[ro];W[pr];B[or];W[qs];B[rr];W[sr];B[rs]

(;B[mk]C[prana: wrong direction];W[oj];B[pi];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl]
C[prana: now, the w invasion was successfull.];B[ql];W[oi]LB[qb:C]
[ne:B][nh:A]C[prana: too slow, don't push on the 4. line. B is happy to answer here.
Better A, B or C];B[ph];W[kk];B[di]C[prana: also too slow.]
;W[dj];B[ei];W[ej];B[fi];W[gj]C[prana: big success for w. b is overconcentrated]
;B[ik]C[Really good move on B's part. How should W handle it? becuase of the O8 weakness, L9 is actually rather weak.]
(;W[ii]LB[hl:A]C[bad move?
prana: as you already mentioned, there are some weaknesses in the w framework, so it will be hard to capture J9. But if you cannot capture, the stone at J11 is useless.

Better defend at H8 immediately.];B[jj];W[kj]LB[li:A]C[prana: too slow]
;B[ji];W[ih];B[jh];W[ig];B[jg];W[if];B[jf];W[hl]TR[if][jf][ig]
[jg][ih][jh][ii][ji][jj][kj]C[I gave up. B could join left or right. and the L8 weakness still exists. I decided to just back down.

prana: the exchange of the markde stones is good for b];B[il]
;W[hm];B[im];W[in];B[ld];W[lc];B[ie];W[je]C[Bad move?

prana: yes, the cut doesn't work];B[jd];W[ke];B[kd];W[lf];B[mg]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[mh]C[misread this part. My bad.];B[le];W[mf]
;B[kf];W[ng]SQ[pf]C[should W have played Q14 instead?

prana: both possible];B[of]C[sealed. now the right side is untouchable.

prana: yes, but you should play R18 now to reduce it. This move is very big]
(;W[ci]C[Up to here, W is losing by 12.5, according to score est.

The main killer was the J9 invasion.];B[qb]C[prana: this is huge.]
;W[ob]C[Bad move here. B N18 will create a world of trouble.]
;B[li];W[og];B[pg];W[ll];B[ml]
(;W[md]C[prana: this does not connect.];B[me];W[ne]C[Bad move again.]
;B[nf];W[oe]LB[od:A]C[prana: bad exchange. A instead];B[pf]
;W[nl];B[mi];W[oh];B[od];W[jb]C[no choice.];B[nd];W[ib]SQ[mc]

The main points will be Black's moyo on the right side at the fuseki, the J8 invasion. Please also enlighten me a little on when to invade and when to reduce.

Please please give as much comments as you can, as this game contains a lot of my questions on Go.

Thanks again and Cheers!
