C[This is a game I played in your local Go club. I (Timo) prefer playing quite aggressive, and Juha plays usually calm and well calculated games. So perfect opponent for me! We are currently highest rank players in our club, so I delivered this to get a review. In our club, there is only one dan -player, kind of "title" owner, and strongest person is the only dan. Juha just raised me to play him without handicap, so it makes me 1 kyu. Thank you very much on reviewing our game! If not mentioned otherwise, all present comments are my thoughts.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[hc];B[hd]C[After game Juha told following sequence was good for white, and not even as I thought.

Commet: this is a special joseki for some certain situations, but not good in the stage of fuseki]

;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[jp];W[qk];B[qi];W[qo];B[fq]C[Thought of a pincer against r5, but though this was clearly bigger when white's positions on upper left are considered.]
;W[cn];B[dm]C[invaded here

Comment: it's probably better to play at P4 or O4 first and aim for R7]
;W[dn];B[em];W[dk];B[cm];W[fo]C[Comment: the invasion of D7 was a failure,black made a weak group for himself]

;B[ig];W[nb];B[mb];W[qc];B[mf];W[lb]C[Comment: black didn't gain much on top, black should play 64 rather than 63]
;B[qp]C[too cautious?

Comment: black may consider playing Q5];W[po];B[np];W[ok];B[qd]
C[Chose not to chase yet, though I must break f9-p9 later

Comment: 71 was very important for both territory and safty]
;W[ma];B[bn];W[bo];B[cj]C[Appears to me as good invasion point]
;W[ck];B[ch];W[dj];B[di];W[ei];B[ci];W[cg];B[dg];W[eh];B[bh]
C[Success, but white gets good shape facing center of the board... bad exchange?

Comment:the exchange isn't bad,because white gave black alot of territory]
;W[hk];B[im]C[Thought building bottom compensates for whites good shape. Also I must keep an eye of p9 I talked earlier.]
;W[jk];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp]C[Because of this move, white gets important point

Comment: this is big yose move,but still too early. L7 is very critical because black's group on top isn't safe yet]

;W[ml];B[ni];W[og];B[ph];W[oi];B[nh];W[oh];B[ng];W[nf]C[kept l14 as future purpose, maybe ko.]
;B[nj];W[of];B[lh];W[pg]C[left too many weaknesses around so white takes profit]
;B[qg];W[qf];B[pe]C[Comment: This shape is obviously akward for black,black should play S14 to live]
;W[rg];B[qh];W[rf]C[at this moment I noticed our remaining times... I have been too hasty...]
;B[re]C[maybe p10?

Comment: if black played at p10,white would play Q10
white has 1 more liberty than black];W[rh];B[ri]C[looks bad, should have concentrated on o15 area.]
;W[qj];B[ne];W[pi]C[Wanted to release l14 now, to make ko fight

Comment: the ko is the last chance for black, though black definitely has to lose something in order to win the ko]
;B[kf];W[lf];B[le];W[me];B[ij];W[ik];B[mf];W[oe]C[this looks bad, instead of losing just r12, I'm close losing q15 too.

Comment: black is behind about 15 points or so,probably should resign]

;W[aa];B[ac];W[nk];B[tt];W[tt]C[Losing r12 and q15 groups cost me too much, and I lost by clear numbers. White played as calculated and cautious game as usually, leaving few or none openings for me to take advance of. Our club thanks you very much for reviewing!

Comment: black chose the wrong joseki on top left at beginning, which results a weak group for white to invade. Always try to avoid having a weak group throughout the whole game unless it's necessary. please email me if you have any more questions]
