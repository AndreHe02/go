AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[IJT:
Hi, first of all thanks for your time spent on reviewing the game. I played
white on this one. I don't know if the handicap was correct since I'm not
quite sure if I really am 25k as kgs says, and he played better than a 30k,
probably you can estimate that much better than me.
I lost by 9 points; I will appreciate any comment about how could I improved my final score.

z: I am Dimitri, the reviewer.  I play as "zenjutsu" (11k*) on IGS.  First, thank you for submitting your game to the GTL.  More games reviewed = more learning experiences for all.  Second, please take all my commentary with a grain of salt, as I am far from a "Go expert" myself.  Third, I will preface my comments with the "z:" notation (as found before this paragraph).  Last, if you have any additional questions, do not hesitate to ask.

z: Overall, this game was frequently characterized by both black and white playing too many small and unnecessary plays when larger plays were available.  Also, both players missed many key opportunities in the various in-fights which occured.

z: I suggest working with life-and-death problems to help with the infighting.  Also, life-and-death help to build a better understanding of whether a play is necessary to keep a group alive, of if you can afford to make a bigger play elsewhere.]
;W[nd]C[z: I'm not very familiar with fuseki in handicap games, so I won't comment on most opening stones.]
;B[jp];W[pj];B[dj];W[gc];B[fb]C[z: This black stone seems odd to me.  But I'm not a real joseki expert.]
;W[qq]C[IJT:
What about this opening? Do you think it was good or should I played somewhere
else?

z: I think the 3-3 is too soon.  You still have many other opportunities to attack black, and can leave the 3-3 for later (assuming black does not close out the possiblility).  Making this invasion now will lose sente, which is an essential to keep when white in handicap games.]
;B[qp];W[rq]TR[rp][pq]C[z: I'm not familiar with this move in the corner.  Usually, I play #9 at one of the triangles.]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[ps];B[os];W[qr];B[rs];W[rp];B[ro];W[so]
;B[qo];W[sr]C[z: Why?  Why not ensure life with S6?];B[sn];W[sp]
;B[cr]C[z: If black wants to play in this area, I think the 3-3 point is stronger.]
;W[qe];B[dg];W[rm];B[rn];W[kh];B[on];W[pm];B[pn]
(;W[om]LB[mm:B][nm:A]C[IJT:
Should I have played this stone more to the left side, like in A or B, to
extend my covered area?

z: No.  If you do, Black will cut you apart.  See alternative move trees (neither of which is good for white) for samples of just one turnout from each of "A" and "B" options.]
;B[mm];W[nn]C[z: Appears over-aggressive.  Too easy for black to O7 and leave this stone very weak.]
;B[nm];W[mn];B[ln];W[no]C[z: As a rule of thumb, empty triangles are very weak.  If you want to utilize these stones, perhaps use their potential to threaten black, instead of creating a large group for him to capture.]
;B[lo];W[oo];B[mp];W[lm]C[z: Right idea.  Hitting an opponent's cutting point is a good habit.]
;B[po]C[z: Yikes!  Black doesn't respond!  You can now ladder his O7 group.]
;W[ml]C[z: Good.];B[nl]
(;W[ll]C[z: No no no!  Continue the ladder (see alternative).]
;B[ol];W[pl];B[nk];W[nj]LB[mk:A]C[IJT: Was A (N9) better?

z: The key was to play the ladder instead of the M8 stone.]

;B[kk];W[kl];B[ji];W[il];B[ni];W[mh];B[oj];W[oh];B[pk];W[qk]
;B[qj];W[ok];B[pi];W[oi]C[z: This won't work, as black can Q9.]
;B[pk];W[rj];B[ql];W[qm]TR[pl][om][pm][qm][rm]C[IJT: I guess that 5-stone group was lost and I should have played somewhere else by now

z: Yep.];B[rk];W[rl];B[qk];W[qc];B[sm]C[z: Black wastes a stone.]
;W[oq]C[z: Right idea, but it shouldn't work.  Black can just O3.]

(;B[sl]C[z: Black errs.  See what his O3 would have looked like (alternative move tree).]
;W[nr]C[z: Good, you took advantage of black error on last move.]
;B[qn]C[IJT: This move was unnecessary from him, right?

z: Right.  He still had two liberties, and could make that capture any ol' time he wanted to.]
;W[op];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[ii]C[z: Black is VERY strong right here.  Placing this stone is too easy to cut apart.]
;B[nq];W[ij];B[mo];W[ns];B[np];W[or];B[ls]C[z: Wrong play by black.  White's weakness is that he has numerous weak groups on board.  Black needs to cut them apart.  Of course, white needs to connect them.]
;W[nh]C[z: Right idea.  Connect your weak stones.];B[ph];W[pg]
;B[qg];W[qf];B[rg];W[rf];B[sf];W[se];B[sg]C[z: The last few plays from both black and white have an end-game feeling to them.  Perhaps the threat of black Q16 makes them sente, but I'm not convinced that is the case.]

(;W[rd]C[IJT: Was this move necessary, or that small area was secure enough?

z: If you don't play there, black can cause some mischief.  The main question is whether or not that mischief is more damaging than black playing K12.  See alternative move tree to see black's mischief potential had you not played there.]
;B[jh];W[jg];B[ih];W[hh];B[ig];W[if];B[hg];W[gg];B[hf];W[gf]
C[z: This whole sequence was bad for white.  Never try to make a ladder that doesn't work.  Now you _still_ have two groups that are not connected, black is stronger, and your two groups _still_ have many cutting points.  The only achievement is to make black stronger.]

;W[lf];B[jg];W[fd];B[hd]C[z: Unnecessary.];W[cc]C[z: It is good to take advantage of the last unnecessary move by black.  Keeping sente is a good habit.  However, the key question at this point is "what is essential"?  Right now, it is essential for white to shore up his center group. It is a long no-eye dragon with many cutting points.]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[ia];W[ja]
(;B[na]C[z: This does not help black.  Black should attack you center group.  See alternative move tree for example.]

(;W[ej];B[gh]C[IJT: I totally missed this one

z: Even if you connected, it's still dead.  Back up two stones and see alternative.]
;W[hi];B[cf];W[ee];B[dh];W[df]C[z: Good... threaten snapback.]
;B[di];W[ce]C[z: Good.];B[de];W[ce];B[ek]TR[ac][ab][aa][bb]
[ba]SQ[ed][de][cd][dc][dd]C[IJT: He should have played at A (D16), right?

z: No.  white is alive.  Playing at D16 does nothing.  White has two large eyes already (marked with squares and triangles).]
;W[dd]C[z: Unnecessary.];B[dk]
(;W[bf]C[z: Play C13 instead (see alternative move tree).];B[cg]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[af];B[ag];W[ae]C[z: If you must play locally (I still think saving your center group is more important), then play A12 instead.]

;B[fq];W[fn]C[z: I cannot believe white made life.  Black should have tore your group apart.  Also, had black simply ignored your attacks in the A12 area, he could have used sente to ensure that this entire center was his.  Sure, you would have gained a few points on A&B line, and he would have lost a few, but killing the center group would have been worth _much_ more.]
;B[eo];W[em];B[dm];W[el];B[dl];W[jp];B[sc]C[IJT:
Do you think that this invasion could have succedded somehow? It surprised
me since I thought that upper-right area was secured, but I doubted for a
moment. I couldn't think of a variation that would have been successful.

z: It could only succeed if you decide to take a nap.  Otherwise, if you respond to his plays (which you do) it will not succeed. However, you do not need to respond right now.... see alternative move tree to see what happens if you play elsewhere.]

Well, this is it. With the score different plus my 0.5 komi I ended 9.5 points behind. I would appreciate if you could assess me on which techniques should I improve.

z: I recommend doing life-and-death problems.  They will help you read when your groups are alive or dead, and help avoid unnecessary plays.  Also, keep in mind that winning a local fight (such as A12 area) is less important than what occurs on the whole board. You are very fortunate black let your center group live.  Had he cut that group apart, the game would have been very lopsided. Overall, you did a good job for your rank-level of taking advantage of cutting points, threatening your opponent to make eyespace/territory, and defending yourself when attacked.  Keep up the good work, and enjoy the game!]
