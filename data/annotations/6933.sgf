I was 2k but haven't played for a long time. Now coming back and still rusty.
This game was free game on KGS with a 3k player.

Dear Shai,

Thank you for sending your game to me for review.  Firstly I should warn you that while I am only a few stones stronger than you so please take my comments and suggestions with caution.

Overall, the key mistake was that you permitted your opponent to build a grand shape with no weaknesses.  You were lucky to reduce it as much as you did, most of the variations I explored lead to you dying.  Similar situations come up when your opponent tries to build a central moyo game - if you leave reducing until late chuban/early yose then you will be unable to reduce it sufficiently unless your opponent makes a mistake.  Instead, accept a local loss and dive in before it's fully resolved.

PS: I've deliberately left a number of sequences in the game record even though I didn't comment them.  These were just things that were going though my head which I thought I'd leave a record of.  Hopefully that will give you some idea of the sort of things I'm thinking about, especially as I read out fights]

C[a bit unusual in the opening maybe?
--
Black is experimenting.  This opening seems playable for black although I would play Q7 at R6 personally.  I think black is concentrating more on learning than on winning.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf]C[--
Jump also seems okay here];B[nq]C[Joseki says black to play D13, instead b tenuki.
--
Tenuki is okay - black played this sequence to get a wall towards R15 and this move helps with that.  I personally would have chosen a shimari in the upper right over O3, but this seems fine too.]
;W[dg]C[Is this a good move or should I have played in the bottom right corner?
--
I would have played O4.];B[oo];W[qq]C[--
You can also ignore this, Q4 is very hard to kill even if black adds another stone.  Having said that, I'd have played R3 too]
;B[eg]
(;W[dh]C[I considered also E12. Which is better, D12 or E12?
--
E12 makes better use of E16];B[ff];W[kc]C[--
approaching R15 directly would be my preferred option - this seems to allow black to enclose R15 corner and force white towards the relatively strong E17]
;B[mc]C[--
Perhaps too direct by black but the right idea];W[hc];B[kd]
C[--
I would play L16 at Q17];W[jd];B[ke]C[--
I would probably tenuki here - this group feels alive but unpromising for expanding.  I guess it depends how promising you think your attack is on E17]

(;W[fj]C[--
exploiting K3 is more urgent.  In many ways this is the move that cost you the game.

I'll expand on this a bit.  These moves are all good locally, building a moyo towards D4/C6.  However globally black has just one weakness (F3) and a dangerously large upper right/right.  These weaknesses cannot be left even if there are really big moves like F10.]
