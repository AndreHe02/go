C[Hello,

I'm Julien, 2k. I will review your game by inserting comments and variations in this sgf file. Please feel free to contact me for additional details.

General comments:
I think the most important things here is that both players played too much bad shapes (like empty triangles) and slow moves (like first line moves in the opening). Try to play good shape all the time and to choose the wider area of the board (when all groups are safe).

Hope this helps.];B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[ed];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc]
;W[ic]TR[qc][ne][pf][qf]C[That is not joseki. Playing one of the four marked points is more usual.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[mc]
(;W[ld]C[ What did you expect by playing this move? Too easy for black here.]
;B[oc];W[nb];B[ob];W[ne];B[od]
(;W[ma]C[Wrong move since you can't save your 2 stones. Should play L17.]
;B[mb];W[kc];B[na]
(;W[kb]C[That is the kind of slow move you should learn to not play anymore. Indeed both sides are already strong in this part of the board. So playing here is small and you should play in a wider place: something like 03 would be much better.]
;B[la]C[Indeed this move is even worst (for the same reason)...]
;W[ka]C[As well as this one (only very few points in gote)...]

(;B[dj]C[That is a good move (even if I would prefer developing myself with K4 in this position, but I guess both are playable).]
;W[dg]TR[dl][jp][nq]C[This move is not very bad, but it is a bit slow. On one hand, the bottom side is now wider than the left side (because of the black stone at D10) and, on the other hand, if you want to put pressure on the D10 stone, you should better play D8 (closer than D12, and from your own weaker side).]
;B[dm];W[cm]C[A contact play is usually to defend yourself. If you want to attack the left black group, you should prevent to play a contact move (C9 or C8 are more usual in this position). Since it is a bit hard right now to know which move is best to attack these stones, I would play in another place (still 03, or just F3).]
;B[cl];W[cn];B[bl]C[I guess than playing D8 would be more solid and better for eye shape.]

(;W[bm]TR[cm][cn]C[Empty triangle! You should not play such a move, except if nothing else works. Locally, D6 is better and usual. But since you're already solid here, tenuki would be the best move here: play O3.]
;B[ch]C[Too small. Also, you should not play a kosumi from the third line against a stone on the fourth line (because you will push behind).]
;W[cg]C[Yes: good response.];B[dh]
(;W[eh]
(;B[el]C[Locally, should be E11. Orelse tenuki.];W[gp]TR[jp]
[eq][nq]C[Bad move because it does not protect the corner (still a ko). If you want to defend here, play E3. Or else play a wider move like 03 or K4.]
;B[fj]TR[iq]C[Black is already solid here. So he should play in another wider place like J3.]
;W[jp];B[en]C[Still very small.];W[ep]C[Maybe E3 to remove the aji in the corner.]
;B[mp];W[lq]C[Don't play a kosumi on the third line against a fourth line stone...]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[lo];W[mr];B[nr];W[lr];B[oq];W[ko];B[ln];W[lg]
TR[lh][mh]SQ[qf][mj][nj]C[With such a strenght, I think you could go further here (at least the triangle stones), or invade at R14.]
;B[mj]C[Now, it is almost impossible to enter in the bottom right.]
;W[ki];B[kj];W[jj];B[kk]
(;W[jk]C[This move and the following ones are small since there is no way to enter in the black territory even if black tenuki once.]

;W[hp];B[io];W[gq]C[Good.];B[hm]TR[cc]C[All these move are small. Both players still have to play on the upper left. Also I guess C17 is still opened.]

(;B[li];W[kh];B[mi]TR[li][mj]C[Very small move and bad shape (empty triangle).]
;W[lh]TR[lg][kh]C[Idem: very small move and bad shape (empty triangle) ;-).]
;B[mh]C[I wonder i do right here to play p13 and should not instead enter even more in the black position qor even r13 or that even some other move is even better.

It is difficult to say because black is stronger now and the side is less open. So a move like R3 is no more easy to play. My conclusion is that you would have to invade previously. It is a bit too late.]

I would like to play more active during the games. This one feels like a waste of time and resource. :'(]
