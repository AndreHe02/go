(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]C[Commented by Andy (Okies, 7k* on IGS).

This is my first commentary for the GTL!  So I will start with a disclaimer.  I learened everything I know from IGS and the GTL.  I haven't read any books on go, so I don't know the fuseki very well.

I've tried to comment mostly on what I feel were mistakes in thinking.  A few tactical points, but hey, I'm not a tactical wizard myself!  :-)]

;B[dd];W[pq];B[qd];W[cp];B[oc];W[qj];B[qg]MA[oc][qd]C[This move seems small.  You already have a shimari here (marked stones).  They are safe, and you only extend two spaces >from it!  You aren't threatening the r10 stone at all.      I would suggest a move in the lower left or lower right corner.]
;W[df];B[ce]C[Already black seems over concentrated on the upper side.  Maybe a pincer would work better here?]
;W[cf];B[fd];W[jc]MA[cf][df]C[It's too early to invade like this!  And black is safe on both sides.      Why too early?  I used to think "How can k17 be bad?  Surely I can live or run, and I take a bite out of black's territory."  But the problem is not k17 itself, but the fact that there are more urgent moves!

White needs another move for the marked stones (c14, d14).]
(;B[po]C[I think black should attack somehow here.  The upper right group is extremely safe, and the d16 group is ok.]
;W[qm]
(;B[qq]C[Now this seems like black changed his mind.  First, black plays q5, a high move.  This says he wants influence.  Now r3, trying to take territory?]

(;W[pp]C["Hane at the head of two stones"

Gee, white just hit his own head!  :-)

I think it's too optimistic to try to cut, so maybe the variation, getting eye space for white and taking black's away is better?

Remember, defend before you attack!]
(;B[qp];W[qo];B[oo];W[pr];B[qr];W[lq]C[This is an incomplete patch job.  If you're going to patch, do it right the first time.     Notice on move 58, you have to defend.   Right when I saw move 22, the first thing I did was go ahead and see if white had to play here again.  Sure enough, he did.]
;B[qn];W[ro]C[Leave this move for later I think.];B[rn];W[rm];B[rp];W[mc]
C[After the dust settles in the lower right, black got a great result.  He is alive, and the white groups on BOTH sides are weak.

White returns to the top, but I would prefer around c11.];B[hc];W[cc]C[Wow, doesn't seem like this can turn out well.   Now there are THREE week groups here!!  Surely black can profit somehow.]
;B[dc]C[Wrong direction.  You must keep white separated.      b15 is the move, and it also puts even more pressure on c14-d14.

Unfortunately, I can't really analyze what happens in the corner, but surely black can get sente to play d11?]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[de];W[bc];B[bf];W[ad];B[bg]C[Ok, black cut off the c14-d14 stones, but at what price?  The b14-b13 stones are cut off also!  So who is doing the attacking?!]

(;W[ef]C[Oops, white lets black take a breather.];B[cj]C[Ok, this fight is more fair now.]
;W[cl];B[bk];W[bl];B[ej];W[eq]C[White takes time out from the fight to take territory.  Hmmm.....]
;B[cn]C[Well, I admit that it's very hard for me to find the best moves in this type of position.  White has a large potential area, but also several weak groups.  In fact, the e14 stones look like the could almost be caught.      I'd like to see what a stronger play has to say about this position.]
;W[dm]
(;B[dn]C[This move is very heavy, you should play light moves.];W[en];B
[eo];W[do];B[dl]C[Doesn't accomplish much.];W[cm];B[gq]C[Looks like an attempt to salvage the situation, but can't white play j3 and leave black with another bad situation?      I think a light reduction is called for, like say l4 or so?  (Shoulder hit to reduce)  This would also play against the weakness of the q3 stones.]
;W[fo]C[White plays it safe.  Too safe I think.      j3 should be ok.];B
[jq];W[nq];B[mo]C[Wrong direction, p5 is alive, k3 is not.  Should play something like k5.]
;W[gf]C[White runs, but it is not good enough to ONLY defend.  Why not play somewhere around c12 to defend AND attack?  g14 surely doesn't threaten the f16 group.]
;B[oq]C[Black seals white in, and helps his k3/g3 stones some.  But I think there are better moves.]

;B[ig];W[ih];B[hg];W[hh];B[fh];W[gg];B[dh]C[It's painful to have to play this move and give up sente.  I'm not sure if it is necessary or not...

Black would sure like to get some moves in on the right side like s11 or q7.]
;W[hd];B[id];W[gd];B[ge];W[cb];B[ee];W[dk];B[dj];W[hj];B[fk]C[I would rather play q7 to get into the center more.  This also threatens the white group on the side.

Also some move on the bottom might be helpful.];W[mh];B[nf];W[me];B[mg]

 GriGri 13k*: yep w+8.5

 mareks 12k*: :-) i did not counted i thought i lost because of that bottom group

 mareks 12k*: it was big mistake

 GriGri 13k*: yes

 mareks 12k*: you played well esp. on top

 GriGri 13k*: but i make big mistakes too :)

 mareks 12k*: fortunately for me :-)

 GriGri 13k*: thx, i've just eaten a 11k last night :)

 mareks 12k*: i believe that you eat me almost

 mareks 12k*: it was interesting game

 mareks 12k*: ok sure i want it reviewed

 mareks 12k*: ok thx a lot

 mareks 12k*: you also escaped from left side well but at the same time i created big center

 mareks 12k*: see you

 mareks 12k*: cut at o11 was too deep

 mareks 12k*: yes at least i spoiled your ter on left side

 mareks 12k*: it is very difficult to say ahead how to defend

 mareks 12k*: but usualy in such position it's better just play in middle

 mareks 12k*: m9 or so because you can escape to bottom

 mareks 12k*: right side stayed alive like your top i thought i could kill your top but G17

 mareks 12k*: group was weak

 mareks 12k*: so i could not play at E17

 mareks 12k*: useless attack :-)

 mareks 12k*: you would create second eye anyway])
