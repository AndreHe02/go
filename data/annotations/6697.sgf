C[Dear reviewer, this is a game record from my last tournament.
I played white and I won by resignation.

Please give me hints on how to improve. I added comments where
I was not sure if I made the right move.

******************
I will do my best.];B[dq];W[dd];B[pc];W[qq];B[pp]C[I was happy about this move. Q6 would be more useful for black.
Am I right?

***********
I am not familiar with any Joseki variations starting from Q6.  This is standard Joseki. 

In terms of whole board play, I would imagine that black would prefer to be on the star points for this type of play, but I am not strong enough to say.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[or];B[mp];W[pe];B[ph]C[************
I do not like this pincer. White will run, black will chase and get thickness from the Q12 stone. But there is plenty of space below for white to come in and live. Black will then be overconcentrated.]
;W[md]C[I guess this is not joseki. What would be the proper move here?
*******
This is Joseki. See http://gobase.org/joseki/chap4/joseki4.html.]
;B[oe]C[***
The hit on top and extension is correct. But I have no idea what the full board effects are.]
;W[pd];B[od];W[oc]C[*********
This is a highly complex Joseki variation, and I doubt any of us knows what the effect of all this play is.]
;B[nc];W[ob];B[nb]
(;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[pf];W[qd];B[qe];W[rc];B[nd]C[*********
In the end, this result is favorable for Black. White's corner is fairly small. N16 is useless. Black thickness across the board is impressive.]
;W[rn]C[I was afraid of Black R5. Is S6 the right time, or is a kakari
in the lower left mor urgent?

**************
Hard to say. IMHO, I think the Kakari is more urgent. White still has some wiggle room on the right even if black plays R5 - at least a reduction is certainly possible.

White is behind and needs to move faster to catch up. IMHO.]
;B[fc]C[*********
This is the wrong direction at this point.  You generally want to push toward thickness. Play from C14 or thereabouts will allow black nice possibilities on the bottom left.]

(;W[do]C[******

This is a bit risky, rather than responding at C14. White is probably better off doing the variation first.]
;B[df];W[fd];B[gd];W[gc]C[**********
This is yet another complex Joseki variation which I don't know how it plays out.]

(;B[ed]C[This seems wrong. See variation.];W[fe];B[ee];W[ec]
;B[dc];W[eb];B[db];W[fb];B[cd]C[***************
This is bad for black, especially considering the variations.  White is comfortable, and while the corner is big, black's thickness has been neutralized.]
;W[ef];B[de];W[kc]C[good or bad?
********
Bad. This is unnecessary for the safety of the white group and gains less territory than helping the D5 stone. Play around bottom left is correct direction of play.]
;B[eg]C[********
Although the followup moves are kind of big, play on the bottom left is still bigger IMHO.]
;W[cj]C[*******
This is good, though I would play closer to D5. You are too loose in general with your play, not enough safety.]
;B[dl]C[*****
Now you pay.];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[cr]C[Would not F3 be better for Black?]
;W[hq];B[ej]C[************
White's gain here is small, black's is large.];W[pm]C[Is this good in terms of direction of play?
****
Yes. It chases the black group toward your left corner stones.  It is a good move.]
;B[mn]
(;W[ff]C[I did not like the idea that balck could take my stone in sente.
However: is this the right time?

****
No. And taking the stone is not Sente. See variation.];B[qf]
C[I considered this a slow, not urgent move. Am I right?

***********
Absolutely. I think Black was thinking of R14, R13,P14,Q12,O14, which cuts off the five stones above. But if black responds at Q13 instead of R13 he is fine, and the loss is very small - not worth eliminating in gote.]

(;W[cl]C[Here I would like to have some suggestions what to do better
with the C10 stone.

*********
Well, its in trouble, so there isn't a heck of a lot of possiblities. The variation you played out was bad. See the variation.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[bl];W[cn];B[ck];W[el];B[ek];W[fl];B[ho]C[Overplay?

*********
Yes, the N4 group is weak, and you can split this stone and them.]

Exactly];W[io];B[hn];W[ko];B[ml];W[km]

(;B[fs]C[Mistake? If Black wants to seperate he must risk a ko here. Is
my analysis correct?
****
Don't see a Ko.];W[gr];B[fp]C[********
Pointless move by black.];W[fo];B[on];W[nm];B[mm];W[nn]

;B[ds];W[ar];B[bs];W[hk]C[********
Black needs to help H7 group.];B[pk];W[pl];B[qk];W[ok];B[pj]
;W[nk];B[mk];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni];B[kk]C[**********
White should have made this move 10 moves ago, not black. It was always sente.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[pi];B[qi];W[qh]C[********
Who wins the capturing fight?]
(;B[rj];W[ri];B[rh];W[qj]C[******************************
So to conclude, it appears that while black gained some advantage early on, he became confused and over-cautious in the fighting that followed. White's aggressive style was successful.

Generally though, White will find if he does not prepare attacks more and insists on complexifying the game that he will lose against players more able to punish him for his plays. The result on the left hand side here is an example of what can happen if white goes too far with this style.

Good luck with your games and I hope these comments were useful.]
