C[General Comments:

Some good moves here and also many missed opportunities. Pay attention to liberties, both your own and your opponents. Try to read out out seqences, for example move 24.  

I use letters for marking possible moves.  A is always the response in the game. 

I hope you find the review useful.];B[gc]C[edgamen [-\]: hi]
;W[dg];B[cd];W[gf];B[ef]LB[ee:A][eg:B]C[Black's move is agressive and clearly intends to start a fight. A passive move at B will allow black to make a large framework.]

(;W[ee]LB[ed:C][de:D][df:B][ff:A]C[it's correct this block?  -  
black has provoked a fight, you cannot afford to be passive, I think E5 is a good move. Some other responses have been explored.]

[fg:B]C[This move can save g3 if white f3.]
(;W[he]TR[gf][hf]C[white make an empty triangle to trry to capture g5and extend to the upper corner

This is not an empty triangle because there is a stone at G5.  This shape is not inherently bad like an empty triangle (usually) is, but here it is not the best move.]

(;B[eg]LB[fg:2][eh:1]C[This is a poor move and a good example of an empty triangle, black has only two liberties]

(;W[gd];B[dh]LB[fc:A][eh:B]C[B would be a good move - exploiting the weak shape of E2]

(;W[fc];B[fh]LB[ce:A][ch:B]C[white let black make territory on the lower corner and threat the upper stone

This is a good result for black, he is alive and the left-hand side is open. 
The cut at D5 could be difficult for white.]

This move comes a little late, black can seperate the D7 stone or cut at D5]

This move is not very threatening because C5 is in atari];B[cf]

White is dead now for sure, black should play B forcing a white response and avoiding the problems at A7 caused by a lack of liberties.  With B black can still win.]
