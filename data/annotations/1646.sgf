C[rogga: about the rules:
When the game being over, the system will calculate the points occupied by
Black, said B-point, and take 361 minus B-point to get W-point. If this is a
komi game, B-point must be minus 2.25 and W-point must be plus 2.25, then we
get the final result.
Result is: W+9.5p (175.75 vs 185.25)

to be sent to rogga@pchome.com.tw
and  gtl@jeudego.org   white is rigth, he should have lost without the white invasion at 3-3 point which came alive.

both white and black play very fierce (black even more so) without taking into consideration strategy (the whole board) and accepting a give and take attitude which is at the heart of go.
this attitude should lead you to play more flexibly, if the other want something very badly, let him have it provided that i take a little more elsewhere in the process!!]

I think when B play c , then I can play C15 or D15.
When I get Black, I usually play three-star.  But the game is played by two people....

Both are possible; the only move to avoid is d cause

it is ok, it is an invasion, you can extend on both sides & you prevent a black pincer
it works also with delta influence];B[ql]C[ok];W[qf]C[i recommend var3 to black, var 2 comes second]

you cannot obtain everything
you had too many weaknesses to start with
you corner group is still not connected

you have to make territory in the corners first, the sides second and center last, knowing it is difficult]
