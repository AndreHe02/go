;W[nc];B[rd];W[qc];B[qi]M[qf][qi][qp]C[ ** It could be that black is a bit 'low' on the right hand side. But nothing   to worry much about.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[ed]M[nc][pd]L[ec][cj]C[ ** Right direction. Could also be at a). The point b) is also an important point  
 after the joeseki in the lower left corner (cf. Ishida's Dictionary of Basic Joseki,

 Vol. 3, p. 66). Since the two marked stones are quite  solid, the left is generally
 more important than the top.];W[ec]L[df]C[ ** Right idea (by not pincering), but probably better at a).]
;B[fc]L[dd]C[ ** Better to play a) and go into the nadare joseki. This would build up the left   which is what you want.]
;W[dc];B[gd];W[cf];B[jc]M[gd]L[fd]C[ ** Right idea since it would be pretty pointless to extend one further in the   face of the solid white position. Even better would have been to have played   the marked stone at a) on the previous move, since this would have given you
 a perfect formation. The present black formation is a little bit cramped.]
;W[oq]L[cl][de]M[cf]C[ ** A kakari, but not so big because white is solid to the left. a) is a good move  
 to pressurise the three black stones below, and with this in mind white should have  
 played his previous move (the marked stone) at b). This would make the left side   bigger.]
;B[pn]L[po][op][pq]C[ ** Yes a pincer would be pointless. a), b) or c) would be other possibilities.]
;W[lq]L[qq]C[ ** A silly formation. White should at least play somewhere on the fourth line.
 or something like a).];B[pq]L[op]M[dn][dp][cq]C[ ** A big move. It takes the corner territorry and makes it less attractive for    white to invade the right side above. Since white is solid on the bottom black    shouldn't expect white to answer at a) here though. The left side is also quite   big. This is the biggest open space, and the three marked stones are the only
 slightly vulnerable stones on the board.];W[cl]L[cj]C[ ** Takes territory while attacking. This is what a black move at a) would have
 avoided.];B[cr]M[cl]L[cj]C[ ** Ishida (in the Joseki dictionary) describes this as being necessary after

 the marked stone. But you should still feel that you are "submitting" to white,

 i.e. it is not a very attractive move to be forced to make at this early stage.]
;W[ci]L[fe][el]C[ ** Same formation as the bottom - very small. More interesting would be to   go for a box-like territory, perhaps starting with the peep at a). If black   connects, white might jump to b) for example.]
;B[fo]M[fp][dl]L[ql][qk][pj][oi][nf][op]C[ ** There are no weak groups, so black should develop his biggest territory on the
 right. White still has invasion points, a) or b), or reduction at c) here.

 Black could defend more or less directly at d), or he could be more ambitious at   e) or f) for example.

 Another point is that the move has little effect on the solid white stones. The  
 reverse of 'don't touch weak stones' is: 'play against strong stones'. Black doesn't

 mind white adding stones to his already solid formations, so it would be more   interesting to play either of the marked attachments.]
;W[hp]M[fq][dr]C[ ** This is too small to even worry about. Even if black could cut off both the    marked stones for example (and he can't) white would still be perfectly alive   and happy. Endgame stuff.]
;B[of]C[ ** Good.];W[ql]M[of]L[pj][pm]C[ ** Notice how this invasion is a LOT more dangerous now the marked stone is in    place. Depending on the balance of territory, white would have liked to play a

 safer reduction move now, a) or b) for example. But it is not clear that he   can afford to be complacent here.]
;B[pl]L[om]C[ ** Don't touch what you attack. a) would be better.];W
[qm]L[ri][qj][pk]C[ ** A bit heavy, i.e. it will be to whites disadvantage to give up TWO stones   now. Probably a), b) or c) would be better.]
;B[pm];W[pk]L[qk][qj]C[ ** Doesn't work but white is on the verge of collapse anyway. He might still   just survive after a) or b), but the life will be very small.]
;B[qk]L[pj]C[ ** Good. a) would amount to much the same thing, but more complicated.]
;W[qj];B[rk];W[pj];B[rj];W[lc]C[ ** White is obviously hopelessly behind after the exchange on the right. Still
 the 'honest' move would be to develop the very weak white stones there.]
;B[kb];W[hc];B[hd]L[gb]C[ ** Ok the link-up may not be huge for white, but this is being a bit too   friendly. a) is better.]
;W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[ic]L[hb]C[ ** Good. No need to rely on the ladder occurring after black a).]
;W[hb];B[je]M[pj][qj][pk]L[lg]C[ ** Very solid. You could also play something like a), engineering a large-scale

 attack on the marked white stones while covering the cutting-point. By the way

 the ladder is favourable to black at the moment, but it is of course prudent to   cover the cutting point more directly.]
;W[rc]C[ ** Big since it secures the corner group and takes a fair amount of territory.]
;B[pi]L[ll]C[ ** Too small-scale. White would be more worried if you played something like a).

 With the marked stone in place this is still a serious attack. It is true that  
 white has some forcing moves on the right, but it is not worth playing here to  
 forestall them. Playing here makes the three white stone light - expendable to  
 white, since you will be spending to many moves capturing. Remember three stones   is only six points.]
;W[nk]C[ ** Too slow - white should be thinking about giving the stones now.]
;B[jj]C[ ** I'm not sure what black is trying to achieve here. Since it is difficult to    form any territory by attacking the white stones, black should probably postpone    the attack for the time being. If white wants to spend another move there fine!]
;W[lk]C[ ** perfect move for white.];B[jl];W[lm];B[le];W[li];B[kh];W[ef]
L[mp][lp]C[ ** Black could here try a leaning attack at a) or b) (see Var. 1).]

(;B[or];W[nq];B[bm]C[ ** Now the game looks relatively close. Black has failed to get much out of his   attack on the group to the right.]
;W[bl];B[bn];W[dq];B[ep]M[kh][jj][jl]L[fg]C[ ** Seems small. There are still some potential in the centre with a) for example.]
;W[ei];B[gf]C[ ** Small. Black is following white around.];W[fg];B[hg]L[hh]C[ ** Why not one further with a) ?];W[el];B[gi];W[re];B[rf];W[qd]
L[sd][sf]C[ ** a) is correct. Now black has the possibility of playing b) later, threatening   to rescue his stone.]
;B[na];W[sf];B[sg];W[se];B[qe];W[sd];B[rh]L[rg][ri]C[ ** A white cut at a) would only be a couple of points in gote (black answers   calmly at b)).]
;W[nr];B[al];W[ak];B[am];W[bj];B[ds];W[fr]L[fs]C[ ** a) is correct to forestall black playing here.]
;B[es]L[fs]C[ ** a) is two points bigger.];W[fs];B[fj];W[jn];B[no];W
[lo];B[dk];W[dl];B[ej];W[dj]L[gl]C[ ** Small. Better to jump to a).]
;B[ek];W[ck];B[gl];W[ni];B[lh];W[mh];B[oi];W[nj];B[mb]L[ob]C[ ** Better to go further in with a).]
;W[ob];B[mc];W[oa];B[mg];W[ng];B[og]L[nf]C[ ** a) seems better here since the white stone then will become short of   liberties.]
;W[nb];B[md];W[mf];B[lg];W[nf];B[pr]L[os]C[ ** Big. White should have played the sente sequence beginning with a) (not
 Q2). Compared with that this is 5 points in reverse sente.];W[ik]C[ ** Doubtful. After this white should have no chance to catch up.]
;B[jk];W[il]L[hm]C[ ** Better to follow up with a) rather than lose two stones.]
;B[im];W[hm];B[hl];W[jm];B[in];W[io];B[hn];W[ho]L[gn]C[ ** Should be a). There is quite a big difference between the two - after the   squeeze the black stones would be a bit short of liberties.]

;W[nh];B[ib]C[ ** Big since both the black and white move here have good follopw-up moves.
