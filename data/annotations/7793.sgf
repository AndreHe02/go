C[Hi, thanks for reviewing this game.

I'm playing white as Thinking.

--

inimino: Hi, I'll mark my comments like this one throughout.

Let me know if you have any questions or spot any mistakes in my comments or variations.  I added some comments on the variations you added, and added some new variations also.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[nc];W[qk];B[qi]C[Usually at this point I play safely at R7, but since I've seen R5 very much lately, I wanted to give it a try.

--

inimino: I suppose at my level either move is about as good as the other.]
;W[qo];B[qm]LB[pm:A][rm:B]C[The invasion was expected.

inimino: I think white should better play at B here.]
(;W[pm];B[pl];W[ql];B[pn];W[qn];B[om];W[rm]C[Black got a ponnuki in sente, was this a bad idea for white?

inimino: Yes, the thickness towards the outside at such an early stage of the game seems worth much more than the three or four points on the side.  So in this case I think that since b got the outside w got an unfavorable outcome.]
;B[po]C[I felt this move didn't threaten my group...

inimino: It doesn't threaten to kill it, yet, but it threatens to make it even smaller than it already is.  You could try R3 here, see var.  R4 is interesting also and there can still be a ko here, so I think it is too early to tenuki here.]
(;W[jq]C[...so I wanted to nullify his wall, but safely.

inimino: Better to threaten to destroy the wall while making your side group more secure, and then try this only after that.]
;B[qp];W[mq]C[I still felt like his moves were too slow, and didn't have a strong impact on my right side group.

His wall feels useless now.

Was this a bad idea, was R4 sente?

inimino: R4 is not sente for the life of the group, but it is in a precarious position and will probably cost a lot to keep alive while b continues to build thickness.  I think the value of this wall is quite high, because it effects the rest of the board, not just the bottom side.]
;B[pk]C[Now I really want to start living on the side, he has played so many moves here that I feel like answering.

inimino: Yes.  But even if this lives, it is already sealed in, so I think the result of all those tenuki plays is unfavorable for w.]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[fd]LB[fc:A][df:B]C[inimino: You have marked A and B here but I would consider H16 or H17 as well.

This is a good position in which to see that the influence of the black wall at Q3-Q9 is not really nullified by those two white stones on the bottom side.  In fact the black wall is felt strongly over the entire board, making even a modest invasion here feel a little dangerous for white.  This is why influence is worth more in the early part of the game.  I think the biggest mistake in the game may be that you underestimated the value of the wall.]
(;W[fc];B[gc];W[ec];B[gd];W[cf]C[By playing like this, I wanted to make black's moyo smaller.

As a result, it seems to have grown stronger.

Black can still live in the corner, so the other variation would've been more suitable here, right?

inimino: I am not a joseki expert, but I prefer this to the variation you pointed out.

However, as you mention, the moyo is imposing, which is why I think a pincer/invasion may be a better idea.]
;B[cl]TR[cj]LB[cf:A][dq:B]C[Which side is stronger, A or B?

I felt like A was stronger than B, so I pushed black towards A.

Would C10 have been better instead?

inimino: Both white corners are perfectly safe, at the moment, but black has a lot of influence in the center.  I think C10 is much better because it gives w some chance to get into the center before too much of it becomes black's territory.  Neither A nor B is really weak, so I do not think that should be the main consideration.]
;W[cn];B[ci];W[en]C[inimino: Given the situation in the center, this seems terribly small.  If you want to make a jump, E14 would seem a better place for it, or you could try to invade right away.]
;B[je]C[His moyo is getting very strong.

I'm horrible at invading, what should I do now?

inimino: You should have probably invaded earlier, or at least built some thickness towards the center to support an invasion.  I think black is going to get at least 60 points in the top right area of the board, and this seems to make the game difficult for white.

Often if you think you are not good at something like invading, it is because you are doing it at the wrong time, not because you are actually any worse at it than anyone else.  If a lot of your invasions end badly it could be because you often invade one or two moves after your last chance to invade profitably.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qe];B[pe];W[qf];B[pf];W[rh];B[qj]C[I didn't notice R10 was sente for killing my group.

inimino: I don't think it is, but the next move will be for certain.]
;W[pg];B[og];W[ph];B[oh];W[pi];B[pj];W[oi];B[qh];W[qg];B[ri]
C[inimino: Now the white side group can be killed.];W[ni]C[I felt that getting out was important, but now my group on the side falls victim to S11.

inimino: Indeed.  Black did a good job here of pushing your invasion towards your other weak group and then splitting them to attack both.  You could have avoided this earlier by not making a weak group on the right side, or perhaps by trying to invade in a different place.]
;B[rk];W[sn]C[inimino: These ko threats could be worth a lot later on, so you should try harder (unless it is a very fast game) to make sure you read out the life of your group and tenuki as soon as it is already dead.]
;B[sp];W[sl];B[rl];W[of];B[oe];W[nf];B[ne];W[mf];B[me]C[
inimino: I count about 70 points on the board for black, and for white about 50-60 points or maybe some more on the bottom side with luck.

Perhaps a play around E8 first to threaten the side group, and then try to get some points aggressively in the center, while discouraging an invasion.

Black will probably try to invade around that large D3-K3 gap soon, so that should be your main thought.]
;W[rc]C[This move seems small.

Where should I have played instead?

inimino: S17 looks big but I agree it might be a little too early.  I made some suggestions on the previous move, and just a simple move around G3 is probably bigger than this, but maybe not enough to win.]

;B[gq];W[hr];B[go];W[gm];B[hn];W[ho]C[inimino: I don't understand this move, looks like aji keshi to me.]
;B[gn];W[gp]C[inimino: Oh no :(];B[fp];W[fo];B[hp]C[This ko seems like a very bad idea for white.

I wonder what I was Thinking (heh) while making this ko.

No possibility of really winning it considering B3, D4 aji.

inimino: Yes, I think white knows that with this loss of territory, b is solidly ahead, so he tries to make a last fight.  But this ko seems to be one white cannot hope to win... so maybe better would be to wait for another opportunity.  I think w looks a little behind, but should not be so desperate to try something like this just yet.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[gp];B[fn];W[eo];B[hp]C[Bad ko-threat.

inimino: Yes.  White can just connect (see variation) and at least the outcome is not too bad locally.

However, if black answers this ko threat at R2 I think the result is better for white.]
(;W[qq]C[Bad ko-threat.

inimino: Yes.  White can just connect (see variation) and at least the outcome is not too bad locally.

However, if black answers this ko threat at R2 I think the result is better for white.]
(;B[io];W[qr];B[pp];W[pr]C[inimino: S2 directly is better.  Either way it is gote, but S2 leaves more possibilities for the yose.]

Thank you very much for reviewing my game.

(;W[fk]C[How could I miss this move?

I must've been pretty tired, since I thought black could play F8 now.

inimino: Well he could, but it doesn't do much good.  ;)

I guess you were thinking about wanting to push at D8 and get the ladder.  Unfortunately b was able to defend against this in sente.

If you play this way, b can get B3 which is bad for your corner group.  Connecting at E7 was really important.]

(;W[rm]LB[rl:A][rn:B]C[Which one is better for black, A or B?

inimino: I think they are about the same.

How do you choose the direction of blocking as black?

inimino: You have to read to the end of the sequence and then consider the whole board position.  In this case, the question is what will most help the Q3 stone, because either way it will be weakened.

After looking at the variations, I think S6 might turn out a little better for b, but I cannot really be sure.]
(;B[rl];W[ql];B[rn];W[pm];B[qn];W[pn]C[Would this have been better for white?

inimino: I think so.

Maybe black can cut here at Q5, which is an interesting variation but too complicated for me to say anything definite.]
