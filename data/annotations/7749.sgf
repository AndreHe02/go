C[L16 better ?

I would play around M17 or F17.  This is a slow move that doesn't create influence or pressure white in any way.]

(;B[ld]C[too slow and still high, White can easily Invade around O17, making M16 meaningless]
;W[ij];B[kj];W[il];B[kl];W[jh];B[lh];W[kf];B[lf]C[N14 ?

Yes, I think it would be better, but all these moves are pretty slow when there are ways inside for white, like O3 or R6]

You are right, E2 was better a few moves ago ^^];W[io];B[ip]

No, this move is reasonable, you lose the game because your fighting skill is lower than your opponent]
