RE[B+2.5]
RU[Japanese]

C[DW: Thank you for reviewing this game. I played black. It was the first time I had played for several months, and I feel I lacked intent and assertion throughout this game.

Although I ended up slightly ahead, I only won because of the komi rules. I did not feel confident at any point during the game. At some points I felt I had a larger advantage, but lost it by pushing too hard.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and will be well studied.]

;B[nc];W[qj]LB[cj:A][ql:B]C[This is a surprisingly uncommon position! 

There are two very large points on the board now: Splitting the left side and extending from the shimari. Ideally you would play B, White would make a one point jump, and then you could play A. As it is though, if you play B, White should just play D10.]
(;B[dj]LB[fc:C][cf:B][cl:A]C[DW: I was hoping to prevent any white moyo from forming, since I started off focused on territory. So I played D-10 instead of C-10 so I could have more influence against any moyo he tries to build. But maybe C-10 is still better?

This move is not seen very often. It is much harder to make a base now, because you will only get one foot on the 3rd line. After White A, Black B, White C. 

That does not make it a bad move. This move is used primarily when Black will be trying to build a large-scale moyo. it is also used if white has very developed influence/thickness on the rest of the board, and Black is afraid of moves that press him down. With Black so low on both the top and bottom side, and White low on the right, it seems like this is not so big a concern now though, and it seems hard for Black to play a large scale moyo strategy as well!]
;W[cm]
(;B[dg]LB[cf:A]C[DW: I was assuming having one unsettled group was a fair price to pay to cut away his influence on the left side

This is another global moyo move. Two space extensions on the 4th line are not very strong except towards the middle. The three space high-low combo of A is much more common, and White has given you room for a base!]
;W[gc];B[ql]C[This is now a big move that seeks to invade White if he does not reply. Before we get to that part of the game, there are some useful techniques to know about this very common joseki! [see diagram on lower thread\]]
(;W[jq]LB[cq:B][dq:A][fq:C][dr:D][er:E]C[[W\]: Here are some other psosible invasion you might want to keep in your aresnal as well. Because of the distance of C7, there are a couple options.

A might be the most common, but the 3-3 and the approach are playable as well. D and E are played with a small enclosure, but I am not sure about this one. I have shown some illustrative sequences for each, but do not worry too much.]
(;B[hq]C[DW: Now I have two unsettled groups, but he has no large moyo. Moyos scare me, I guess.]
;W[mq];B[ho];W[fq];B[no]C[DW: Risky to push him toward my weaker side, but I like the territory I threaten in the LR]

;W[kp];B[kn];W[np];B[op]C[DW: I was shocked he let me get away with this exchange. It seems really bad for him from my perspective.]
;W[or]
(;B[pi]C[DW: I could use some input on this tenuki. The LR corner is big, but I was hoping to launch an attack on his R side stones and end in senti so I could protect the LR afterward. Am  I too ambitious with this move, or does it have merit?

[W\]: if you want to attack him, why not invade?];W[qi];B[ph]
;W[qh];B[pj];W[qk]
(;B[rl]C[DW: This forces him to decide between invading my center or building eye space. I feel like I am trying to do too many things at once - I am hoping to build center influence, unsettle his stones, and protect my LR territory.]
;W[pk]C[[W\]: This is absolutely unbearable. You lose any real chance for attack by being cut so solidly.]

;W[ni];B[nh];W[me];B[ne];W[lj]
(;B[jj]C[DW: Is L-12 better? It would pressure the N-15 stone more and still offer the future chance of cutting off the M-10 stones.

[W\]: There is a saying "push towards thickness". Maybe try A, pushing him towards your thick wall.]
;W[ll];B[om];W[ol];B[ml];W[mk];B[nl];W[pm];B[on];W[qm];B[rm]
;W[mi];B[kh];W[re]C[DW: so his group is safe and I have lost the strength of that beautiful row 6 wall I had. Plus I can't defend at Q-2 because my center stones are not settled yet.

Your center stones are doing ok because the are facing a black position.]

(;B[jd];W[hd]
(;B[fd]C[DW: Looking back, F-13 looks so much better to me than this move. He would have had to spend a move to defend his E-15 group, then I could have taken D-8 in sente, then cut at L-9. That would have left me in a much better position than I ended up in.

You are right, it is often better to force from the outside to make a large position. But! if you can read out a kill, then take it. You missed a few moves that would have really made your situation easier (like before).]

(;B[ie]C[Last but not least there is another way here too. However at this point I think white is generally safe.]
;W[hj];B[ik];W[hk];B[il];W[fk]C[DW: Now I face the weakness of my unsettled middle-left group. Instead of being able to attack with ease, I have to fight to survive.]

(;W[hl]C[DW: I am glad he was focused on his own survival, instead of killing me. I don't think I could have won the fight if he had cut at H-6, considering he has many more liberties in his dragon.


H6 is also sente, so he should be in no danger.];B[ip];W[jp]
;B[hn]C[DW: The rest is endgame. I can't see any major attacks left, unless he makes a major mistake in his K-4 group. I feel like he could have won the game if he payed a little more attention to the points and keeping sente from here on out.]
;W[qr];B[rn]LB[rc:C][pd:B][rh:A][bj:E][rq:D]C[Lets count endgame values of some of the major points!

A: captures 4 stones, saves one stone, gets three points = 8 points gote
B: captures 2 stones, saves one stone, reduces top right corner = 9 points sente
C: more complex, but I count it at 8 points gote (see variations)
D: is a pain to count. if white gets there first and black replies, both white and black's follow up is gote, so you average the values: White D, Black blocks, White plays again = W +0, Black plays again W-2.
Therefore the average result when white plays first us W-1. Now if Black plays first, it is also gote. so the same process takes place. Black first, white replies = B+3, Black first, white tenuki, B+9, average is W-6. Basically the difference here 5 points.
E: 6 points sente, 9 points in gote.]

[sn][oo][qo][ro][so][pp]C[Summary:

1) Opening
Play the high stones with the mind of building a large scale moyo. Also, think about the ways the joseki will develop after they are played.

2) Middlegame
Work on reading, and remember that if you try to kill something but fail, it is a huge loss to the rest of your position, but not trying to kill groups that can be killed is also a problem. Move 45 was a particularly dangerous move. try to find alternatives to empty triangles (61, 97), and make sure you read cuts very carefully (so you can avoid crude cuts like the 83 85 combo). Finally, work on looking for the most efficient attacking moves (139, 141 were too slow).

3) Endgame
You did very well, but you missed the aji available with 181 at 215. You also had a nice tesuji available bu playing 191 before 189, but he did not play well in response to 189.

Overall:
You got very lucky when he decided to make slow living moves when the fights were in his advantage, and 106 in particular was a great opportunity for you. Nice turn around win :)

If you have any questions, just leave a message with Wrenn on KGS, or email me at JPKerpan@gmail.com]
