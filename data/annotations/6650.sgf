C[Hi!
This is a game where I guess both made a couple of big mistakes. W let me build a big influence. For B, the point is, I (ElClampino) don't like my fuseki and I guess it wouldn't quite work against somewhat better players. Also, I must concede the yose is horrible !! I don't play for so long and I'm still not used to it, so I would really be pleased to get some advice about both ! I just asked W if he wanted to get the review too, I don't know if he has questions about it, so please the best would be to pinpoint the main mistakes or misreadings with some more efficient sequences...
Hopefully you will enjoy the game, and thanks a lot for reviewing :o) .
ElClampino

Hello ElClampino,
I will be happy to review, I'll concentrate on big mistakes and fuseki.  If there is something horrible in endgame I will point that out too.  Please forgive me if I make any mistakes myself, I am kyu as well.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[ep]C[If you are working on improving your fuseki, I would recommend using more basic moves.  Sticking to 3-4, 4-4 and 3-3 still gives you alot of variety and complexity.  Jumping into the 5-4, 5-5 and beyond is at the best going to give you alot arguments about complicated josekis.  And at the worst, it's going to confuse the game so that your reviewer is not going to even give good advice! :)

That being said, I will do the best I can with my limited and imperfect knowledge.]

;W[cq]LB[cf:C][cm:B][dq:A][fc:D][nc:E][nn:H][qf:F][ql:G]C[So, here it is hard to say what is the best direction of play.

There are several areas to choose from, I've marked A-H.

First, consider big moves, the simplest way to consider big moves is to look at the space between them.  That puts moves D and E at the top, as well as H and A.  Next come B and C as well as G and F.

The next important thing to consider is urgent moves, moves that dramatically change the local situation.  For instance, moves that threaten the life of a group while building outside thickness (or other such gains).

For example a play at A would probably have white play at B, a play at B would probably have white play near A.  So A or B are black's sente, and you should consider them if you are sure you know which one you want.

For instance, if you played A, then (after white's reply) played H, you would be building a nice framework on the bottom, already threatening to be 60 points or so.

But perhaps this is not your plan.

A play at E for instance, would be OK if there are no urgent moves, and you have not yet decided which way to play your sente against white's groups.

E would be building up strength at the top, allowing you to attack more severely later.  It is also a play along the largest side of the board.

G however seems to be picking a fight, (which is OK) white should probably fix at S5 and then perhaps black can play H. forcing white to get out (say by leaning on G).  This would strengthen G, letting you build a second framework along the top.]
;B[qk];W[nn]
(;B[mp]C[Please see the variation, I think maybe white is leaving a serious weakness.]
;W[jp];B[ln]C[I really didn't want to be surrounded, for I wanted to fight for influence. But I know I may surrender much more than I should... Thought about N6, but I'm not sure there wouldn't be any disruptive answer (can't read it out so well)... Any suggestions ?

As pointed out white has problems.  Getting out is OK.  but you must consider a counter attack as well, use your stones to the left.  A move at H4 would be very nice.  I would probably play it immediately, but playing this first is probably OK too.]
;W[ok];B[pi];W[ni];B[mk]C[To me, Wn9 would have given him an outstanding shape into the center.]
;W[er];B[gp];W[hr]
(;B[iq]C[Played too fast

See variation on how to cut.];W[hq];B[hp];W[ip];B[in];W[mr]
;B[lq];W[lr];B[kq];W[jq];B[kr];W[jr];B[ks]C[Good cut.  However,  these stones are not very important yet.  Notice that white's group is already strong on the left (one of the groups you are cutting).  The one on the right only serves to disrupt you group which is not yet weak (it is out, and also next to a very weak white group (please refer to earlier variation when black plays S5 -- here you may do that or play S2 first at least before cutting).

So, perhaps you should not play L1 yet.  But at least S2 first then L1 would maximize local profit.

Alternatively you may directly attack white and not worry about taking cash yet.]
;W[rr];B[qr];W[rs];B[rn];W[qo];B[og];W[pj];B[qj];W[oi];B[ph]
C[These moves by white are helping black alot.  white should just play S5 while he has a chance.  Without playing these moves, white may sneak in at S5 or R16, for instance.]
;W[ml];B[lk];W[ll];B[kl];W[ro];B[kk];W[lh];B[mh];W[qc];B[qd]
C[I'm never sure which side is the best to block... I thought Q17 would just give me an overconcentrated side structure and not so much compensation. Am I right ?

Yes you want to block on this side.  Generally you block in the direction where your largest area may be built.  For instance if you had a stone at N17 you would not block towards it (playing Q17) since that is only 2 lines distance.  Instead you would block towards your Q11/R10 stones since that is 4-5 lines distance.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[rd]C[This is generally wrong.  It's more important to continue with P18.]
;B[re]
(;W[rc]C[Now you see, white has made a major mistake.  He must first P18 before playing S17.  Here black can simply play P16.  (See variation)]

(;B[qf]C[Here you have fixed in an overconcentrated way.  See variation.]

[sp:E]C[White probably cannot afford to play low anymore.  He has to make his own framework to compete.  However, at this point the game is already lost.  Please count:

A - 15+ points
B - 15- points
C - 10+ points
-----
40 points at least for black.

D - 10 points
E - 5 points
F - 20 points
----
35 points at least for white.

However, it's black's turn, the C area has a huge potential to grow, much moreso than the remaining left and right sides.  Playing tit for tat black should be able to press his advantage for a 15 point win.]
;B[cg];W[ce];B[cj]C[A good strategy, however playing at C7 would be more efficient.]
;W[bl];B[ck];W[jc];B[je];W[kc]C[Seems to me W is very gentle here...]

C[At this point we may add 35 points to white, bringing him up to 70.  Black however we may add 40 more points bringing him up to 80 points.  Still black leads comfortably.]

(;B[od];W[ob];B[nb];W[pb]C[This is an L+2 shape.  It means that white is alive so long as he plays correctly.

Notice, however that it is black's turn.  Black should probably just fix one of the cutting points to complete his shape.

The first benefit here is that Black get's to choose which cutting point.  In this case, playing on the outised (N17) would be best.  The other benefit is that white is sealed in!  (O18 is black, not white).]

(;W[ob]C[White must instead play here.  If black wants he may peacefully reply at O17 and the joseki would revert (O18, N17, S17, R14).  However, black may still press his advantage here by playing P16 (see later variation).]
