C[Commentary :
Hi !

GGG is a nice website and I'm sure you will improve studying An Youngill reviews.
In that commentary I will focus on an important spot : cut/cutting stones/weak groups

I will also comment some variations/positions on the end of the game as you seems to be interested in.

A summary of the game will be available at the very end of that sgf.

***

After a lot of time, i come back to kgs. I always study very much and replay progames of Gogameguru page and others sites. I thought my strength was (or is) more or less 5k, so i registered a new account and asked for a helping-game to fit my real rank. To my surprise, my opponent was a 1d, without any handicap, a very polite player, who said to me (around my 53 play) i was stronger than 5k indeed. It was a very instructive game to me, that my opponent complicated so much from the very beginning (to get a more interesting game, he said to me too, which i thanked him very much because it was a kind of "shidogu" maybe). At last i resigned after a blunder because of byoyomi problems of mine, but i think i had reversed the game into my favor (maybe, maybe...!). At the end of the game, i tryed to figure up some variation of yose to secure that it would have been my likely lead, i think, bigger than the central and overconcentrated moyo of my very kind rival. In short, dear reviewer, i need to know "the truth" about this game and my real strength. Thanks a lot in advance.]

LB[pi:B][ri:C][pj:A]C[Commentary : This is a clear overplay, it looks like a missclick or missreading to me. Although you got tricked in the process so please let consider some variations.]

(;B[pj]LB[pi:A]C[Commentary : this is the first very strange move to. Why not A instead ? (see variaton)]
;W[pi]C[Commentary : This move is natural for White and now the Black stones are cut.]
;B[ri];W[rh]C[Elysium [1d\]: my bad for making the position complicated ;;;

sekiyama11 [?\]: yes, thx a lot];B[ph];W[oi];B[oh]LB[ri:A]TR[ph]
[qh]SQ[pj][qj][pl]C[Commentary : You can't play theses moves, the cutting stone (A) is way more important than these 3 stones.

If you save A then the marked stones (square) become a bit stronger and the marked stones (triangles) are dangerous for White.
I White capture A as in the game, then Black has too much weaknesses and White become thicker.

You have to understand the importance of a cutting stone and of thickness.]

C[sekiyama11 [?\]: thx, master, im not laying with my rank, i study very much, but, so much time without playing...

Commentary : Again that move is strange because Black is safe and White too, so this is "only" points in gote.
Especially because white let these 2 stones being cut.

Summary :
In my opinion, you should try to improve on "urgent move" notion (C and D) and the second thing would be to cnsider the order of moves (A and B)

On the other hand, you succeeded in pointing out some White and that was very nice (E, F, G) and it helped you to take the game lead.
But the first "pass" at H and the overplay at I were painful.

I is probably the beginning of troubles even if as you pointed out in your variation, there were some possible fights.

Giving you a rank is hard on one game so I will not try (sorry)

I hope that game review helped you a bit])

This is a sente and forced move.

You would better protect the cut with B or maybe C.
