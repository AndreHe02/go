C[Hello! I'm Vitamin, 1k (white). Help me to improve please! What is my weaknesses? what do you recommend me  to study?

Thanks in advance!

-----------

Hi! Sorry for being late (as usal). I hope my commetary is of some help anyway. This is an interesting game! Right at the end, Black could have turned the upper right corner into a seki instead of passing, so White's win was somewhat lucky. But who cares :)

Your weaknesses? I think your game is balanced. In order to improve, it might be good to learn some more examples of good shape (you missed some good shape points in this game).

Good luck with your next games!];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[fc]
;W[df];B[jd];W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qk]C[Good joseki for White, I think.]
;B[qi];W[ok];B[oi]C[Better a move in the corner!];W[qc]LB[nc:A]
[oc:B][ld:E][nd:C][pf:D]TR[oi]C[White could also try to play something like the lettered sequence. With a black stone at D, the marked stone doesn't look very effective. Of course, Black can try to play something different :)]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
;B[nc]TR[oi]C[Here, too the marked stone is somewhat ineffective.]
;W[hc]C[i think it was urgent move.

---------------

Looks playable :)];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb]C[right answer?

-----------

I think so :)];B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[bf];B[ce];W[cf];B[de];W[ee]
;B[cd];W[fd];B[ef]C[Is this a good cut? The seperated white stones aren't very weak...]
;W[ff];B[eg];W[dh];B[fg];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf];B[hg];W[ig]LB[jf:A]
C[Simply playing at A should be good enough. Black hurts himself by pushing from behind like this...]
;B[ih]LB[if:A]C[Having come this far, I would prefer to cut at A.]
;W[if];B[jh]LB[dj:A]C[Good point, but to slow. Black should play at the left, may be at A?]
;W[ck];B[dn];W[cp]LB[gq:A]C[A looks also interesting.];B[fq]
;W[eo]C[right answer?

Separating the black stones must be good :)];B[en];W[fo];B[gm]
C[Bad shape.]
(;W[hp]LB[el:A]TR[gm]C[After the maked stone, A is a good pont for both sides.]

;B[lr]C[White has played a lot of moves here, but now he have to make them work!]

(;W[gi]LB[hi:A]C[i think, it was bad sequence for me

------------------------

You shouldn't allow Black the good shape move at A! Peeping at A instead of the marked stone is much better.]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[im];W[kf];B[fi]LB[el:A]C[Interesting move by Black :) At some point, White shoud play at A, I think, to see how Black reacts. A is also a very good point for Black, so...]
;W[gh];B[ei];W[dj]LB[ch:A]C[Is this good shape? Black has some nice moves after this, such as A.]
;B[fk];W[hj];B[hh];W[jj];B[ek]LB[el:A]C[now the result is very bad for white, because of weak group.

--------------------------------

You are right :) But instead of the marked move, A is better, I think.]

;W[hr]LB[er:B][fr:A]C[Do you have to sacrifice a stone here? I think A instead is possible. But playing around here is good; A Black move at B would weaken the white group.]
;B[ir];W[fr];B[hs];W[er];B[nk];W[nj];B[oj];W[nl]LB[ol:A]C[Black has an easy time after that. White is in some danger after A, but I still would prefer to play that way.]
