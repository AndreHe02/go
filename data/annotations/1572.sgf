;B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[ep];W[dq]C[> I am interested in D3.  I wasn't really sure how to respond

D3 looks like a joseki that will give small life in the corner in exchange for B getting good influence on the right (compare to D4, F4, E3).  A quick look on the joseki database shows it isn't joseki, so it is obviously not a good enough move.  The closest joseki is E3 instead of D3, to which W replies D4 and B replies D3.  it is possible you would get to that situation if you played D4 now.

Personally I would now play E3, expecting C6, and I would then jump out to H3, feeling happy enough.

BTW, the joseki databases I use are www.joseki.com, or www.cwi.nl/~jansteen/go/joseki]
;B[eq];W[hp]C[> H4 made sense, but it seemed early

Yes.

Greedy, isn't he :-)

The normal move here is C6 because that compensates for B taking the right, and settles the corner.  So you should be looking to minimise white's group on the right and put some pressure on the corner.  You should expect w to live in the corner though.

W is trying to confuse you, if they don't push it you end up in much the same situation as if you play normally.  If they push you for a mistake then it usually works out very badly for one of you.]
;B[dn]C[A bit slow.  I think I'd have gone for C5 or D4.  Still, about the right direction

F6 just encourages w to play C6.  You're boxed in on both sides so while you may need to escape, now is not the time.]
;W[bn]C[W response is ok.  If I was feeling excessivly agressive I would be tempted by B7 now.  E2 is also sente and useful.  You wouldn't really want w to have it.]
;B[np]C[Hmmm, no.  E2 first];W[kq]C[yeah, this pincer is useful for W because it supports H4.  I think L4 would have been better still for W since they could never live there since E3 is already in place]
;B[pn]C[I wouldn't have played Q6 here because I'd be looking to put more pressure on L3, H4 (in the middle of two black frameworks) and Q6 is likely to end with W splitting at P5 and B taking good life on the right, which I think is worse than pressuring L3]
;W[qq];B[qo]C[R5 is odd.  I don't like that at all.


How about O2 instead? or P5, or even O3
.

The corner is irrefutably white's after R3 so any move attacking it is likely to be gote and small.]
;W[nr]C[Good by w.  You could cut with P2 but you're probably better off improving the framework with a move like R10.]
;B[mq]C[Ok, though kills your aji];W[mr];B[qk];W[gr]C[E2 should be seriously considered here.  W won't want the corner invaded because then their left group won't have life space, so they would have to respond D2 and you've prevented the connection to G2.    Fairly small since N3/N2 has ensured w is connected and so has life, but I'd still play it.]
;B[od];W[jd];B[fc];W[mc];B[nb]C[O17 better];W[nc];B[oc];W[mb]
;B[na]C[P18 better];W[ma];B[ob];W[hc];B[df]C[Clearly you see you don't have a chance of killing that white group or you wouldn't have played D14.  So 'creative' moves like O18,O19 just don't help.  Use them if you think you've got a chance of killing.

> D14 seemed a bit small

It is ok.  I would have gone for Q13 personally.  Also, w demonstrated shortly afterwards that something like D9 might have been better.]
;W[ci]C[your bottom group is now in some trouble.  If it doesn't settle or escape fast you will have it harrassed over the whole board

I'd pull out into the middle.];B[cl];W[bf]C[painful, but possibly necessary.  I would personally have jumped out (E8 perhaps) to avoid this.  The real problem is if you respond (e.g. B16) then w has settled eyespace and can attack.]
;B[bd];W[ck];B[el]C[yeah.  You're better off without this extra exchange.]
;W[bl];B[dj]C[!? C7 much better here.  You are nowhere near strong enough to be making threats like this. w just connects and you're in trouble.]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[cm];B[ei];W[dl];B[em]C[ouch.   this had gone from you having the same nunber of stones on the right to w controlling the right and having sente to erase your wall]
;W[ph]C[which they seem to forget to do :-)];B[qh]C[Hmmm, R13, or better R14,  is a lot simpler.  And you'd really like to get back to the wall so it is better to use simple moves.]
;W[qg];B[qi];W[pg];B[rf]C[Small.  Much better to cut, say O14, or perhaps enlarge with P11]
;W[mg]C[Now your wall is looking smaller and w is safe.];B[og]
C[!! don't cut unless it is going to work well.];W[of];B[ng]
;W[nf];B[nh]C[Yuck.  W is still connected and you've created three stones that practically need to be sacrificed  Plus w has better influence over the corner]
;W[pe];B[oi];W[mf]C[w could have been more agressive there, but ok.]
;B[li]C[Not a bad idea, certainly N12 would help you now, but you should be playing against the weaker groups.  H16?  G5?

> how can I improve this part of my game

This is balance of power/balance of territory stuff.  You could look at "Intro to go: Vol 5 Attack and Defense".  Very roughly play along the line between the two weak groups.  Cut weak groups, don't cut strong groups.  Get more power than your opponent and use this to get more territory indirectly, dont' go after it directly.]
;W[jn];B[kg]C[No, nothing much there];W[hf]C[This was a good move.  You can now see you won't get anything up there.]
;B[he]C[Don't cut unless you have two strong groups to attach to.  White's single stone can be trivially sacrificed and they can build a good invasion just by threatening to connect.]
;W[ie];B[ge];W[ig];B[ib]C[going for the kill? You are generally best reducing from the outside.  Use G18 as a threat of H18 rather than playing there directly.]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[ha];B[ke]C[this is a better move, because it might be used to connect to P16.


> Should I have sat back and roughly calcuated?

Roughly even.  W slightly ahead (+ komi if any), and w better settled.  So it doesn't look good, but still within the reach of a few small errors.]
;W[hd];B[je]C[no point playing little games like this.  Better to come outright and play K14 directly.  Then you have more chance of cutting.]
;W[kd];B[le];W[nd];B[md]C[why? you clearly won't be able to cut (just N15 ensures that).  and you're left lower on liberties]

> N12 at L11

See variations];W[kh];B[jh];W[ki];B[kj];W[lg];B[jg]C[I'd be really worried here, lots of great cutting points for w.  I would have seriously considered sacrificing the 5 stones]
;W[pi];B[mj]C[Ouch, Q10 destroys your how territory.  If you were going to play this you would have been much better sacrificing the 5.]
;W[pj];B[qf]C[why? Forcing moves are only good if they get you something.]

;B[ml];W[mm];B[nm]C[!!! why are you cutting?? Both of white's groups are strong.  The only group in question is yours.]
;W[ok];B[nk];W[ol];B[om];W[fj]C[> I ignored F10 because I really didn't like the look of K6 or H4 against  > G2 and L3.  Is there a good way to invade this kind of structure.

Short answer: You're battling for life, worry about invasions later :-)

Longer answer: Not really.  You can invade a little by threatening to cut (at say L5) and then dropping down to L4.  You can also reduce with moves like F2.  But neither can be done until the group above is settled.  W still has K10 remember!]
;B[hm]C[Ok, ignoring F10 is risky but interesting.];W[il];B[im]
C[K7 better for w here because of the K10 threat];W[hj];B[ij]
;W[jm];B[ik];W[gh]C[H7 better for white here];B[gi]C[No, your group is cut off and this will strengthen white's hold.]
;W[hi];B[fi];W[gj];B[ej];W[hk];B[hl];W[jl];B[ih]C[> I thought for a while about J12

No chance of disconnection.  However it does make K14 a useful threat because you can next reply M14 and collect an eye]
;W[hh];B[gg];W[hg];B[gf]C[things don't look good for you here.  you have a likely eye at N11 but the rest are all dubious.  I'd play M8 next as W.]
;W[lk]C[> It was only then that I worried about life

Start worrying earlier :-)

As soon as this was disconnected it was in serious trouble.]
;B[jk]C[W just resonds L9 to kill this eye];W[kk];B[lj]C[Only chance was K14]
;W[ii];B[oj];W[mk];B[bj]C[Ok.  So going back to where it died...
By far the biggest mistake was the cut (was it at O7?) Only cut where it helps you.  The other mistake was harrasing white around H12.  If you play around a group it gets bigger, and you didn't want the group trying to surround you to get any bigger.]
;W[cj];B[bh];W[ch];B[bg];W[cf]C[W being greedy
D13 much better here, or even B11];B[cg];W[dg]C[best to just play E13 here, keep your lower group connected]
