C[(schach7 - My comments will appear under yours, I hope this is helpful.)
Dear Reviewer.

My Rating is 15k on Dragongoserver right now. I don't have an established rating anywhere else. As I don't really feel comfortable playing under timepressure.

This is a game I played on yahoo. 30 mins per side.

I made some tactical mistakes, but somehow managed to catch up again.
But then I didn't look at the time and lost ;-)

Startegic tips concerning the early stages and middlegame would be very welcome. The middlegame was just a fight though, where I managed to come back, when my opponent didn't pay attention.

Thank you very much for your time.

Regards
Andreas.

schach7 - I am about 8k on kgs. I will often explore possiblities for moves, but I don't always recommend them. Some are just that, possiblities, and not recommendations. You fought well, and did catch up. But my main tips are 1) Stay connected 2) play solid moves.

I think you would have won the game.];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd]
