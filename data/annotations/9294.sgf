 miekun 14k : Hi!

VALE: Hi! My name is Vale and I'll do the review for you in this game. I'm very sorry for my bad english, I hope you're able to understand what I'm talking about ;) ! I'm using the KGS CGoban3 SGF-Editor and if you don't do it too maybe some markers are different than i told in the reviewing text (e.g "I'm talking about a stone marked with a triangle and on your screen it's a circle"). But I hope it will not cause any problems :)

By the way it's my first review for the GTL, so I hope it's in accordance with the requirements :)]
;B[pc]C[
 chip 14k?: Hi!];W[pp];B[dq];W[dd]C[VALE: This opening says: "This is going to be a fighting game! Very hard and rough!" This is because of the crossed situation in the corners: It's not easy to get great territories or influence, for both!]
;B[co];W[qe]LB[co:A]C[VALE: C5 was a bit slow, but quite possible to play, and R15 is a common and good move.]
;B[qd]LB[nd:C][qg:B][pj:A]C[Should I consider adding this kick to my own inventory of good ideas?
I always thought it looked too small ...

VALE: This move by black is playable (it's focused on territory in the corner), but white will profit from this situation as the following moves of the original game show. So it's not the best move here (see move No. 10, there i will explain more to this situation). Black should play around B or C instead of R16.
IF black already had a stone at A, R16 would be a very good move (see variation)!]

(;W[pe]C[VALE: The only right move here! very good!];B[nc];W[qi]
LB[qi:A][pp:B]TR[pe][qe]C[VALE: Now you can see: black is pretty much on the third line and white got a beautiful extension from its two stones at A (R11)! White's stones are also working together with B (Q4).]
;B[fc];W[ec]LB[hc:B][jd:A][cf:C]C[VALE: Same here! This white move at E17 is only a good one if there's already a white stone around A (see variation)! Better answer with moves around B or C instead of E17.]

(;B[fd]
(;W[df]LB[cf:A]C[VALE: This move better at A (see variation).]
;B[jc]LB[cc:A][ce:B][ch:C]C[VALE: This situation doesn't look that good for white. Black looks pretty fine on the upper side (even if black should play K16 instead of K17! Now black is too much on the third line…) and white's corner has three weak points: A, B and C (C17, C15 and C12; see variations after move No. 16).]
;W[jp]
(;B[ch]C[VALE: (Strong move…)]
(;W[cg]LB[cf:B][df:A]C[I think this was a mistake; or if not this move, something later where I failed to get into the left side.

VALE: I think the mistake was to play at A (D14). You should have played at B (C14) instead. And I think it's better to block with B here instead of C13 (see variation).]
;B[dh]LB[cc:A][ce:B]TR[ch][co][dq]C[VALE: After this move, white is so weak at A and B! And black looks strong with this two stones together with the enclosure in the lower left corner! (So better C14 instead of C13, as I already told)]

(;W[gq]TR[qi][jp][pp]C[VALE: Okay, I see, you don't want black to get even stronger there. Good idea! But you have some own weak points there that you have to judge first! The three marked stones here (K4, Q4, R11) are too disclosed. Maybe you should invest one more move here (see variations).]
;B[mq]LB[kq:B][oq:A]TR[jp][gq]C[I didn't know how to respond to this move.  Maybe n4? or something else on top?

VALE: Mh… I don't think that N4 or something else on top would be a good solution. I prefer your solution! It's pretty good! :) If you move something around A your two marked stones (G3, K4) would get into trouble perhaps. So B is nice.]
;W[kq];B[cl]C[VALE: (C8 must be on D8! This is too much on the third line by black…)]

(;W[qm]LB[oq:A]C[VALE: Let's make a break here. Didn't I tell you that this game would become a fighting game? Mhh… it doesn't look like one. It's because your opponent and you did very slow moves which were too passive. This move here (R7) is one of those moves. It's an playable move! but slow.
I think a move at A would be more usefull here, because it avoids black from getting into the corner.]
;B[or]
(;W[qq]LB[pr:A]C[VALE: I don't understand this move. You make it too easy for black to live! better A here (see variation). I think this move and move No. 30 are your loosing moves!]
;B[qr];W[rr];B[pr]
(;W[om]LB[mo:A]C[VALE: This is too easy for black… Better at A!]
;B[mo];W[lr];B[pq];W[qp];B[op];W[oo];B[no]LB[ne:A][mm:B]C[VALE: You don't have to respond to this move. You don't have weaknesses here. Better at A; and even if you respond, better at B. But A is a very important move to prevent black from moving here!]

(;W[on]LB[ne:A][mm:B]C[VALE: This is one of those too passive and slow moves again. Better A or B instead.]
;B[mm]
(;W[oi]LB[kc:D][ne:A][ff:C][dj:E][ml:B]C[VALE: Much too slow again. Better A, B or C. You are behind, you have to try something! So maybe D or E are options to play and risk something.]
;B[ne]C[VALE: Oh, it happend, black is big on the upper side, too. Now white is so much behind!]
;W[ff];B[fh];W[go];B[in];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[hc]C[VALE: Black looks really thick everywhere and is leading. very hard for white to turn around this game.]

(;W[hf]LB[gm:A]C[VALE: I think A would be bigger instead of H14.]
;B[gm]
(;W[nk]C[This was when I started to realize I was behind; I played this move because I didn't see any good moves.

VALE: You are behind since move No. ±30. But it's really good that you recognize it within the game! Other 14kyus don't realize it till they see the result after finishing the game. :)
If you realize, that you are behind you have to forge out a plan to turn the game around (see variation) and don't play slow moves like O9. But I agree with you: black is so thick everywhere, it's quite impossible to get something out of here :)]
;B[og]C[Right, that's much better than what I did!];W[pg];B[of]

(;W[oh]LB[gi:A]C[VALE: This move is slow again, with moves like this there is no chance left to win. You can play slow moves when you are leading. Better at A for example.]
;B[mg];W[mi]C[VALE: Slow ;)];B[fn];W[lk]C[VALE: Slow ;)];B[fp]

[do:9][eo:10][dp:11][ep:12]TR[mj][nj][oj]C[VALE: While you made this three points marked with triangles, your opponent made 12 points that I counted for you here. So here you can see that you played much too slow.]
;W[gi]LB[gh:A]C[I was kinda proud of this move, just because of the shape.

VALE: Yeah! This is a nice move that causes a fight which you need to get something out of this game. Normally black would play at A now. I show you some variations what COULD happen, after black playing at A here.]

(;B[ej];W[gh];B[kh]
(;W[lg]LB[kf:A]C[This jump cut was a little much I suppose.

VALE: Not Supposing! Knowing! Read the situation before moving! Always! Before every move that you do! GO is a thinking game, not a guessing game :) And by the way: yep this is too much ;)

Think about A (L14) instead of M13 (see variation).];B[lh];W[mh]
;B[kf];W[lf]C[I realized these stones would get captured; I was hoping they'd be useful in death later.

VALE: Mhh… I don't think they can be usefull in the death later. Because black is too strong here.]
;B[le];W[kg];B[jg];W[jf];B[mf]C[I was wrong.

VALE: Yap :) Now the endgame begins. The next moves you do are very small endgame moves! Search for the big ones first!]

[nr][as][bs][cs][ds][ns][os][ps]C[VALE: All in all it wasn't that rough fighting game I predicted after move No. 4, because you both didn't attack that much and played slow and safe moves.
In my opinion you lost this game because you had a slackness at the moves around move No. 30. R3 was very bad for example. And another thing is that you often play too slow moves! Be a little bit more aggressive and faster, then you'll profit a lot! :)

I hope you enjoyed this review!

Thanks a lot!
