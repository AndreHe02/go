KM[0.5];B[pc];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd];W[pe]C[reid:  White needs to be careful of this move after black gets
k16 in place.  See variation 1.]
(;B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pf];B[mc]LB[nc:A]C[reid: the joseki puts this stone at a (o17) instead.  This weakness could
be a problem for black later on.];W[pj]C[reid:  Looking at the whole board, it seems that black has played
all his stones on just one side: the top.  This is generally considered
too slow.  Comparing this result with variation 1, we can see that black
missed a chance :-(];B[dj];W[jp]C[reid:  it looks like white has slightly more than 1/2 the board
in his sphere of influence at this point.  It should be *black* with
slightly more than 1/2.  The problem seems to be in the upper right
corner where black has played one extra stone (5 to white's 4) but
is controlling about the same amount of territory.];B[cn];W[en];B[dl];W
[jj];B[dq]C[reid:  Black seems to feel that he's behind already - perhaps a reasonable
assesment.];W[eq];B[cp];W[do]C[reid: white is playing very consistently: all his stones are working
together.];B[dr]LB[cq:A]C[reid:  While this move undercuts the white moyo, it also leaves a hole
in black's shape.  Playing at a (c3) instead would keep black's connection.]
;W[co]C[reid: white exploits black's weakness.];B[er];W[fq];B[bo];W[bp]
;B[cq]C[reid: this cut is expensive for black.  white will be able to jump
deeply into one side or the other.];W[bn];B[bm];W[ao];B[gr]LB[fr:A][br:B]
C[reid:  a (g2) may seem faster for black, but it makes it harder for
black to make eyes.  White can push at a and make false eyes at both
e1 and g1.  Combined with the corner being wide open still (white can
jump in to b - b2) we can see that the black group is very unstable.]
(;W[cm]C[reid:  This is small.  White doesn't need to catch a stone here since
he still has easy access to the center.  It's just one stone.  Better
would be to keep pushing on the black group with something like
variation 2.];B[bl];W[fc];B[ec]C[reid: good move.];W[fd];B[cf]LB[df:A]C
[reid:  Black c14 indicates to me that black is too concerned with
territory.  The important thing in go is life and death: playing at
a (d14) instead would show that black wants to attack the two white stones.
The territory on the left side should come naturally as a result of
attacking white, rather than as an effort, one hard (gote) stone at a time.]
;W[id]C[reid:  Since black has played a bit casually with c14 instead of d14,
white has more latitude in how he responds.  He can be more aggressive.]
;B[ie]LB[ic:A]C[reid:  This seems like the wrong direction to me.  Black won't
be able to build anything towards the center since white already  has k10.  I'd probably want to hane underneath with a (j17) instead.]
;W[jc];B[hd];W[ic];B[he];W[hc];B[kd];W[lb];B[kc]LB[kb:A][lc:B]C[reid:  This move is aji-keshi (erases the bad aji).  The proverb tells
us to "cut across the knights move rather than push into it".  In this
case that would be a (l18) instead of l17.  Since l18 doesn't work, and  since black doesn't *need* l17, he should leave it unplayed (he might
prefer to have b - m17 instead later on...).];W[kb];B[eb];W[fb]C[reid:  now that white is alive here, we can analyze the board situation:
Black has  a moderate amount of territory in the upper right, and a large
territory in the upper left.  But he has a very weak group on the bottom
left.

White seems to have no weak groups, and a large moyo to the right and center.

In order to wini, black needs to stabalize his bottom left group and destroy
a significant portion of white's moyo.  It looks difficult to me.  I think I
would rather be on white's side of the board...];B[mp]LB[jr:A]C[reid:  This is a very dangerous move for black.  Since he already
has one weak group on the board, he cannot afford to try to launch
another group.
White could simply respond at a (k2) and probably walk away with the
game...];W[nq];B[np];W[op];B[mq];W[or];B[nr];W[oq];B[jq];W[pn]C[reid:  This last sequence of moves shows me that white too is thinking
too much about territory (instead of life and death, strength and weakness).
Strategically, white wanted to simply keep the black stones from connecting.
The reason is simple:  If black has two groups, he needs at least 4 eyes
for them both to live.  Making eyes is expensive - it takes lots of moves.
While black is making those eyes, white can be locking up territory (and the
game).  But once black connects, he only needs two eyes - much easier.  Then
both sides will share the remaining territory.];B[gq];W[gp];B[hp];W[go]
;B[jo];W[ho]C[reid:  Gee, this turned into a *big* black side!  How did white
let that happen?  :-)];B[ip];W[ch];B[dh];W[dg];B[cg];W[di];B[eh];W[ei];B

[
 muad NR : is entering byo-yomi];B[pl]C[reid:  This invasion is very deep.  Black will be running towards
the white stone at k10.  It's hard to say how this will turn out.];W[qj]
C[reid:  This is what I would do as white too.  The corner is strong,
and I want black to run toward k10, so this seems like a good move.];B[nl]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[nm]LB[mm:A]C[reid:  I think I'd rather hane at a (n7) instead of o7.]
;B[ml];W[mm];B[mi]C[
 morisawa 8k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[ql]LB[oc:A]C[reid:  This seems too small.  It doesn't deal with any life-and-death
issues.  That makes it an endgame play.  Big, but still endgame.
I might play a (p17) to see how he responds instead.];B[qm];W[pm];B[ol]
;W[qk];B[oh];W[ph];B[hl]C[reid:  If black can hold this whole center, he will be easily ahead.
But there are too many holes in his position.];W[ll];B[lk];W[kl];B[kk];W

[gn];B[em]C[reid:  Black gains about 20 points on the left, but the center is all
gone, and the n11 group is pretty weak.  The weakness at p17 and the
push and cut at m17 are all things white can use to torment black.  It
will be difficult for black to hold everything together.];W[km]C[reid:  l7 isn't really sente now.  It would have been before white played
g9.];B[jn];W[lf]C[
 muad NR : has entered byo-yomi again];B[rf];W[rg]C[reid:  Hmm, if white catches the n11 group by playing l13, it seems to be
a bit bigger than answering s14...];B[kg];W[kf];B[jg];W[lc];B[je];W[nc]

C[reid:  This is not possible.  Black loses a move here at a critical time.
Biggest is to block at a (b3).];W[de];B[ce];W[ed];B[cd];W[fr];B[fs];W[br]
C[reid:  This puts a lock on white's win.

In this game black had a hard time right from the opening.  White played very
consistently and made his stones work together well.  There were very few places
where black had a chance to get back into the game...

I would suggest that black should concentrate on strength and weakness a bit
more (instead of thinking about territory).  In the long run, you will get
stronger by always being on the lookout for weak groups (first yours, then his)
and dealing with the weakness instead of going for territory.
Territory should come as a *side effect* of attacking (or sometimes
defending).  It is too slow to simply take territory in gote.

Good luck, and play strong...

(;W[fr];B[fs];W[hq]LB[gq:A]C[reid: I'd try to enclose black along the edge with this move.
It looks dangerous if black pushes up at a (g3), but I think white can handle
it:];B[gq];W[gp];B[hp]LB[fp:A]C[reid:  Black is threatening a double-atari at a (f4).]
;W[hr];B[gs];W[es];B[ds];W[go]LB[br:A][ar:B]C[reid: but white can keep black busy long enough to go back and patch
things up with g5.  Looks like black dies in the corner (black a - b2
is answered by white b - a2).

So instead of g3, black must keep crawling along the edge.  Each exchange
of black on the second line and white on the outside is a gain for white
(since white already has stones like k10 on the outside it's even better
than usual).]))
(;B[ph]LB[pg:A]C[reid:  Black can pincer here or at a (q13) and get off to an
easy start.]N[variation 1];W[ne];B[nc];W[le]LB[lc:A]C[reid:  If k16 is not already on the board, black will answer with a (m17).
But since k16 is down, black will peep instead:];B[md];W[me]C[reid:  White answers, of course, and then black can:]
;B[pk]LB[qe:A][pf:B]C[reid:  ... extend to somewhere around here (q9).

In the pincer josekis, a common result is that the pincee (white here)
gives the pincer (black) territory (along the top here) in exchange for
an attack on the pincing stone (q12 in this case).  However, we can see
here that white ends up with a line of stones that cannot really attack
anything.  This should already be enough for black to win.

Instead of q15, white needs to play low (at r15) or keep his distance
(with a - r14, or my favorite: b - q14).]))
