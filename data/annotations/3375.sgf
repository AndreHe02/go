C[Dear reviewer,

this is a game I played at the Hannover tournament. There are no yose moves included .
I am especially interested in the Fuseki since my disappointment during the game was growing with each move. My groups didn't seem to work together and all I could do during the middle game was dammage control, so I must have made some really poor choices.
Thank you for taking the time to review this game

C[jos: Given the little potential for territory on the lower side, playing on the 3rd line might have been more reasonable. But I was hoping to keep sente this way.

reid: Because of the black formation in the lower left, the bottom side is potentially large.  The bottom is black's correct direction of play for the future, so if white can take it away, it's a good result for white.]
;B[df];W[qp]TR[ic]C[jos: I thought that b would have to answer this move but b's response left me quite frustrated. Would playing at around J17 have been better?

reid: no, white already gains significantly here.  there is no reason to be dissatisfied.  white's corner is a good size, and the black group is anemic.

black should have continued in the lower right corner, of course.]
;B[id];W[cc]TR[dc][kc]C[jos: entering 3-3 that early didn't really appeal to me. F15 didn't look promising.
Maybe D17 or L 17 would have been more interesting. /?

reid: again, white has no reason to be dissatisfied here.  The corner is a reasonable result given that black has an extra stone in this fight.]
;B[dc];W[db];B[eb];W[bb]C[jos: I choose this joseki bc i was hoping that by jumping to B14 I might devalue the left side for b.

reid: yes, except that black can block at B13 (as he does in a few moves).  but at least white gets sente if black blocks.]
;B[da];W[cb];B[ec];W[bf];B[bg]
(;W[be]C[jos: trying to get sente. Is this the proper shape?
I actually considered bumping at C14 and cutting at D13 like in the var. but this looked too much like hardcore punk.

reid: you are correct, this is better.  in the variation, white ends up with a couple of cutting stones floating in the center.  they can't really attack anything, so they're just heavy.]
;B[cg]
(;W[nm]LB[kc:A]C[reid:  this is white' first major mistake.  there are several ways to look at it:

First, you should always play stones that have future usefulness.  Because black is now strong in the uper left corner, O7 has no prospects of making significant center territory.  And it's the wrong shape for making territory along the upper right side.

Next, if you're trying to surround the black stones, this isn't going to work.  white is too thin here.  If you try to enclose but your opponent ends up breaking out, you're probably going to be worse off than not trying to enclose at all. (in general, trying and failing usually gets a worse result than not trying at all).

if white wants to play against this group, I think the right idea is something like the variation

But best of all is to let these two black stones stew a bit longer.  Instead, take the extension to A and eliminate any chance of black getting a big moyo on the top edge.  because of black's influence, the top side is urgent now.]
;B[no];W[mp]C[reid:  if white is going to play at O7, he *must* follow with N5.  when black escapes, O7 is worthless.  maybe even worth than worthless, because it helps your opponent.

here's something to remember:  we (as amateurs) lose games because we help our opponents.  If we didn't help them, we'd win a whole lot more.]
;B[mn];W[iq]TR[nc][mp][np]C[jos: this move took me some time. I would have prefered to play around O17 which reduces b's moyo on the upper border and builds my own on the right. But I would have hated to see b playing at J3 since it forms a double wing around the b shimari and my 4th line plays at N4 and O4 would look rather silly.
Is this correct thinking?

reid: J3 feels too much like taking territory in gote - almost always a bad idea.  as we saw in the previous comments (variation, actually),  white should have been able to harrass the black P5 stones.  this would lead to white getting either top right or bottom edge territory as black defends.

the double wing is not as scary as black O17 would be.  Because O17 is backed up by a strong formation in the upper left corner, it makes a more secure moyo than J3.  And since white can get strong around L6 by attacking the black stones, it's difficult for black to keep the bottom side territory.

L17 still looks like the right spot for white.];B[qi];W[qf]
;B[rl];W[pn]C[jos: I had expected that b would jump into the center so now the best i could come up with was trying to keep b separated.]
;B[po];W[rn];B[ro];W[rm];B[qk];W[pk]LB[rh:A][oj:B][mk:C]C[reid this is serious aji-keshi - you're helping your opponent settle his weak group.

These white stones are now an ideal splitting attack.  Just prevent black from settling quickly, and the white stones will work naturally.  For example, white A takes black's base.  black probably jumps to B and white gets the attack rolling with C

Q9 looks like white is rushing things.  this game requires patience.]
;B[qq]C[reid: is this a tesuji?];W[rq]C[reid: I don't think so...]
;B[qr];W[pp];B[pj]C[reid: it should be clear that Q10 does more for black than Q9 does for white.]
;W[oj]LB[oi:B][nk:A]C[reid: white helps black some more.  jumping to A is slow, but it's good shape.  B next is a good continuation.]
;B[oi];W[nj]C[reid:  white's relationship here with the O7 stone is fairly miserable.  It looks like white is trying to make eyes here when he should be using these stones to split and attack.]
;B[nc];W[ni];B[oh];W[ob];B[qc]C[reid: wow - black wants everything.  this might give white a chance.  black shouldn't be able to support both the corner and the not-quite-yet-alive group on the right side.]
;W[pc];B[re];W[qe];B[rf];W[rg]C[jos: I was  trying to somehow exploit b's weak spot at S10 but since the black group has rather good shape and access to the center, that plan seems kind of unreasonable. I think the ur corner is one big overplay. Simply taking the corner might have been better?

reid: if white wants to take the corner back, perhaps S14 instead of R15 is better.  black will push up at R15, and white blocks at Q15.  But now black doesn't have time to cut at Q13 - he needs to play R18, so white can connect with Q12i (maybe probe at S10 first).  now the weakness of the black side group is pretty evident.  It may get away, but the upper side black moyo should pretty much turn into white territory.]
;B[qd];W[qb]C[reid: eh?  why does white want black to cut at R13?  that lets black completely off the hook.]
;B[qg];W[jn];B[mm];W[rh]TR[kl]SQ[ki][kj]C[jos: the main reason for K6 was to gain access to the left side and prevent b from getting too much territory there. I considered to continue the attck at L18 but was afraid that the O10 group could take too much damage. Now that i am reviewing this game, a play at L11 or L10 seems to be an option. B would have to fight his way out and w should become thick in the center and able to control the territory b might try for on the left and upper side.

reid:  hmmm, that's kind of strange.  you should concentrate on one thing at a time for now.  In any case, the relationship between K6, N4, and J3 is terrible.  For example, black K4 would do serious damage (assuming the black N7 group is safe).

If you're going to play K6, you need to follow with a severe attack like L8.

S12 doesn't work in any case:  black Q13, white connects, black S11 and black wins the capturing race.]
;B[rb];W[ra]C[reid: black is looking for trouble here.];B[sc]

C[reid: snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, black gets a one-stage ko.  of course, white is lucky here.]
;W[sb];B[op];W[rd]LB[ic:D][ri:B][kl:E][dp:C][oq:A]C[reid: argh!  white cannot ignore this ko threat!  white *must* answer with A.  the entire bottom right quadrant changes hands when white ignores, and the Q8 group becomes a liability.

white has continuing threats at B, C, D, E, and lots of other places.]
;B[rp];W[dn]C[jos: Since the is no rael potential for w to make any more territory and all of b's groups are rather save, my only hope was to reduce b as much as possible. I just wasn't really sure whether to start on the left or the upper side.

reid: well, the right group doesn't look that healthy to me.  white should poke at S10 now.

D6 is really like a resignation move on white's part.];B[cn]
;W[dl];B[nb]LB[nh:B][cm:A]C[black should continue at A., or even better, turn at B to strengthen his liability here while attacking white.

black O18 is too close to the impregnable white corner.  white should be able to probe at S10, then use the weak black group to get into the L17 area.]
;W[mf];B[nh];W[kd];B[kc]LB[le:D][lh:B][mh:A][lj:C]C[reid: black should simply split white with A or B  The continuation at C would be pretty horrible for white.

The two O17 stones are pretty small, really.  white has left a serious weakness at D.]
;W[lc];B[jc]C[reid:  I think white defeated himself in this game.  He felt behind even after he had made significant gains in the opening few moves.  He allowed his opponent to outplay him in the mental game (the game above the board).  If white had simply pressed his advantages, he would have had an easy game.  Apparently white won this game anyway, but at this point, I would rather play black.

white needs to work on developing a coordinated strategy.  It may seem like the board is huge and contains a number of independant battles, but a coordinated stragey pulls all four corners of the battlefield into one grand unified plan.  The stones work together with each stone playing it's part in the whole picture.

Tactically, white needs to make sure that every stone is played on a good, effective spot, not just on spots that 'look good'.

;B[lb];W[em];B[cm];W[el];B[ck];W[dj]C[jos: I now entered Byoyomi so subsequent moves are omitted.
I was actually able to make some points in the center and finally won the game but I feel that the development up to this point is rather disappointing for w.]
)
(;W[no];B[on];W[mm];B[ol];W[pj]LB[qf:B][hp:A]C[gain points by attacking.  white has future good moves around A and B, and black is occupying dame points.

but as I mention in the main line commentary, I think this would be even more effective if white waits a few more moves and lets the positions develop a bit more.  these stones are a burden for black, and are therefore a asset for white.  don't spend your resources too soon.  wait until they can be most effective.]
