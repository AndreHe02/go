AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][jj];W[fd]C[Alexis: My opening plan was to try to pincer corner stones by
playing one space away in each direction. Failing that, I would
play along the side to make a base. I'm not sure if this is correct
in a handicap game.

DRS: I prefer F17, but this is perhaps just personal preference.]
;B[ef]C[DRS: E14 doesn't help the corner much.  A 3-3 invasion is advantageous, because the resulting corner is large.  However, if you do go for the 3-3, F17 would have been better than F16.]
;W[id]C[DRS: I like J17 better, to balance high and low.];B[fh]
C[Matt: My original plan was to secure the W and S and to try to
contain his territory at N and E.

DRS: IMO, E14 is a bit too high, and F12 is way too high.  A large extension along the side is bigger - like K4 or Q10.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[nf]C[Alexis: I was worried about getting boxed in the top, so I made
this move to counter that. And here I started contemplating ceding
the sides to build influence toward the center.];B[oh]C[DRS: This is too high for good development, and doesn't really pressure White much.  If you want to stir up trouble, M16 is probably better, and if you want to secure territory, P17 would be good.]
;W[mh]C[This is slow.  It's better to go after K3, K4, F3, O3, C6 or Q6 IMO.]
;B[oj]C[DRS: So high.  White can invade.];W[np];B[pn];W[nm]
C[Alexis: Not sure if 13 is too big a jump. hoping to connect to
W9

DRS: An extension along the side, like L3, is probably better.]
;B[pl];W[mj]C[Matt: I suppose here I should have moved to connect the wall
along
the E with my other stones, by playing N9 or N8, but I was also
trying to expand my territory at E

DRS: Connecting these groups is not that important.  Better to settle locally with L3 IMO.]
;B[oo];W[no];B[nn];W[mn];B[on];W[ml];B[nl];W[nk]C[Alexis: Knew I had given up a lot by letting him dig in along
the 4th or 5th line, instead of fighting it, but hoped that the
central influence and future corner incursions would make up
the difference.];B[ol];W[fp]C[DRS: Good use of your N5 wall.  Part of me thinks H4 might be better, to make a five-space extension with the wall - but that isn't dual-purpose as this move is.]
;B[oc]C[DRS: The UR is pretty solid B territory now.];W[nc]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[oq];W[dn]C[Matt: I considered playing at D8 to secure more territory along
the
W, but I didn't want to abandon my stone at D4 or the terrritory
at SE

DRS: Double high kakari is severe.  Good for White locally.  In this case, F6 might be better to expand the moyo.]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[eq]C[DRS: B should try to run out with E5.];W[fq]
;B[er];W[fr];B[es]C[DRS: With this sequence, B is giving White a large bottom side in exchange for a smaller corner.]
;W[cp]C[Alexis: was very worried about this, since I thought a black
hane at F1 would have been ugly. However, I wanted to try to
kill the corner, and felt that if I didn't grab sente then that
couldn't happen.

DRS: I think B can probably C5.];B[cq];W[do];B[bp];W[bo]C[Alexis: I didn't counter the atari because I thought that would
save the piece but give him leeway to slide in up the side. Would
rather sacrafice the piece of to seal it safely.];B[ap]C[DRS: B3 is better, because this gives W a sente move at A5 in the endgame.]
;W[ao]C[Matt: F1 might have been correct, but a future black play at
B3 might have jeopardized life];B[co];W[cn];B[cp];W[bm];B[dj]
C[DRS: Reasonable.];W[ck]C[Alexis: I was thinking of this or H13 to claim the north. My
ultimate
hope was to expand thenorth and connect it with the SW.  But
I was worried that if I played directly in H11, for instance,
he would see my intention and resist that. I hoped that by feinting
toward the bottom of his west end, I could obscure my goals sufficiently
while developing northward.];B[cj]C[Matt: it now appeared to me that I controlled NW, E, and SW,
and that I was best served to maximize my territory at NW and
SE

DRS: Grip on UL (NW) is poor.  It's high, and the corner is vulnerable to a 3-3 invasion.  East grip is semisolid - pretty high too.  LL is solid.  Biggest moves for B, I believe, are a reduction around G7, or a corner solidification around E17.  Both are probably sente.]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[ej]C[Alexis: Preferred to give up some pieces & territory in order
to make the N-S connection.

DRS: Don't bother to connect strong groups.];B[bk];W[bl];B[aj]
;W[hh];B[gi];W[fi];B[ei];W[fj];B[dh]C[Alexis: this seemed like a blunder on his part, since he could
have stopped my connection.];W[gh]C[DRS: However, cutting off stones like this, making them suddenly weak, is big.]
;B[dk];W[ek]C[Alexis: again, I'm sacraficing pieces for a solid N-S wall]
;B[cl];W[el];B[ni];W[mi];B[og];W[gf];B[fg];W[gg];B[ec];W[fc]
;B[ee];W[eb];B[db];W[ed];B[de];W[dc];B[cc];W[cb];B[ec];W[da]
;B[dc];W[gb];B[ng];W[mg];B[oe];W[ne];B[ok]C[Matt: Here N2 and O18 seemed crucial, because they would determine
how much territory black would secure along the NE and SE, but
white's sente kept me distracted by other areas.

DRS: Not sure, but As B I'd play N2 before O18 before F1 before B18.]
;W[fs];B[mr];W[lq];B[nr]C[DRS: M2 is faster.];W[bb]C[Alexis: My biggest anxiety here, and for the remainder of the
game, was judging the relative urgency of the following local
conflicts -- this action at the very NW, the unresolved edge
at the NE, the unresolved edge at the SE, and the possibility
of central invasion.   Central invasion I planned to forestall with H10, but I am not
sure if this would have sufficed.

At the SE I was planning to play M2, at the NE P18];B[ac];W[bc]
;B[bd];W[ab];B[ad];W[cr]C[Alexis: Seemed like a longshot, but I thought I was behind on
territory.];B[br];W[dr];B[ar];W[ep];B[dq];W[ob];B[pb];W[od]
;B[pc];W[of];B[pe];W[qi]C[Alexis: Hoping to prepare for a cut at Q13. is this the best
approach? It seems impossible in retrospect.

DRS: Don't solidify B's wall before you invade.  Your chances of connecting back to the outside are better if you don't strengthen B's wall first.  You may also be able to get some forcing moves by merely threatening to connect out, facilitating making life.]
;B[ph]C[Matt: I hadn't realized that the influence white had been developing
for the entire game was as strong as it was.  I probably should
have tried harder to prevent a connection between the NW white
stones and the SW white stones, by playing E8 or F8 earlier,
for example.  Once I did the math, I realized that my only chance
of winning was to claim some area in the middle of the board.

DRS: White's center would be very hard to successfully invade.  If it were B's center in a five stone game, that'd be more likely.]
;W[lr];B[ls];W[ks];B[ms];W[jr]C[DRS: L2 is probably better.  A move like K2 is better for making eyes if you're in a cramped space, but it leaves more ko threats than L2.  So if you don't need the eye-potential, eliminate the ko threats with L2.]

DRS: Not very useful.];W[na];B[ob];W[dl];B[cm];W[dm];B[ck];W[al]
;B[op];W[mo];B[om];W[mm];B[nh]C[DRS: Not useful (In Japanese counting, one point in Chinese counting)]
;W[me]C[DRS: Reasonble.  White's ahead, so eliminate the forcing move.  N16 is better though.]
;B[lb];W[md];B[la];W[mc];B[kc];W[kb];B[hj];W[hk]C[Alexis: Here on it becomes a long cat & mouse game, which I felt
I should win because of my walls. But it took a long time and
came very close. I am wondering if there was a better general
approach for stemming an invasion when one has an advantage in
influence.

DRS: A single stone attaching group helps the group by providing opportunities to make forcing moves, giving something to attack.]
;B[ik];W[gj];B[hi];W[ii];B[ij];W[il];B[ji];W[jh];B[ih];W[ig]
;B[hl];W[gk]C[Matt: this seemed to be a futile effort, especially with the
walls of white surrounding me, but I thought that I would be
unable to win unless I lived in the center.

DRS: Yes.  No further comments.];B[jl];W[im];B[kk];W[jm];B[km]
