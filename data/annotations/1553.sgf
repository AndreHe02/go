C[Dan:   This was (supposedly :) an even game between two 6k*'s on IGS.  I obviously did something very wrong, because I wound up losing by 30.5, but I don't know what it was.

The opening I've used here is new for me, so comments on that might be particularly relevant, but I'm interested in comments on whatever aspect of the game you feel like going into.

I had the Black stones.


Tim:

Well, my intitial reaction is that you should stop being so passive, and you should stop obediently answering your opponent's moves when to do so is small.

If you have to defend, try to do it by moving towards your opponents weaknesses. If you have to run away, try to run into your opponent's moyo to erase it. (but make sure that you can live inside it, don't run into a brisk wall!).]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[qq];W[cd];B[ec]C[Now you should be able to tell how white is going to answer this appraoch: white is going to pincer. (because white has a stone in the top right corner).   Given that, you might prefer to play the high approach. Then again, it might not really make any difference. In the situation where you there both your stones on the other side of the board are on the star points, then the low approach is actually a mistake, or so says "Get Strong at the Opening" (answer to problem 1).

Something I was once told by a fellow player: When you are approaching a 3-4 stone, the low approach aims at building a relatively settled group quickly. The high approach is a bit more flexible. It is quite light, so it is not easy for white to attack it, but it will not necessarily get definite eyes quickly, on the other hand it is more likely to turn into thickness.

Of coures that is an incredibly rough summary. There are a million different 3-4 josekis, so you cannot sum up the purpose of a single move with one sentence, but it is a useful first (or zeroth) approximation.]
;W[hd]
(;B[ee]C[OK, so you got pincered, how are you going to respond? There are three basic plans in this sort of situations.

1) Jump out to separate white. This aims to play a pincer against white H16 in the (near) future. With a white stone in the top right that is not such an attractive idea. The two moves to achive this are the one space jump, as you played, or the two-space jump.

2) Settle yourself quickly. The normal move to do this is the diagonal move to F16. See the variation. This is what I recommend here.

3) Give up your first stone in exchange for the left side, something like Black C13, White E16, Black C10. This is certainly the third option. It is slightly peculiar, but the right thing to do in some situations.]
;W[cf];B[cb]C[O.K. this is a bit like the joseki I recommended, but your shape is slightly weaker.]
;W[bb];B[cc];W[bc];B[hb];W[dd]C[You should have played here with you last move, since it was sente for both players and good for your eye-shape.]
;B[ed];W[hc]
(;B[gb]C[This is submissive. You want to extend the other way to stop white making territory at the top. It looks a little risky, but it works. See the variation.]
;W[ib];B[qf]C[Good move.];W[nc];B[pj];W[ke]C[This is rather peculiar.

If white wants to defend the cutting point the hanging connection is the proper move, making a strong shape. This leaves weaknesses.]

(;B[jp]C[Also big.

Here there is another option: make the shimari at O4. See the variation.]
;W[pp]C[Again, no suprises in white's choice of move.];B[pq]
;W[op];B[ro];W[pl]C[This is slightly peculiar, the normal move is for white to make a two-space jump. Your immediate inclination should be to play Q6.]

(;B[qk]C[I see very little merit in this move. It looks like you have been forced. You don't even have a guaranteed connection along the edge.]
;W[oq];B[mq];W[ql];B[of]C[Now this is a better defenssive move. It moves towards white's slightly thin territory at the top, which as I have said has weaknesses. There may not be any definite follow-up that springs to mind, but you have increased the chances of something interesting happening whilst defending your group.]
;W[qe];B[pf]C[Yuck! Stop it! Another really submissive move.   After you have made the one-point jump to P14, the correct anser to the diagonal attachment is S14. You may worry briefly about the possibility of white wedging in at Q14, but it doesn't really work, so you would rather have your stone at S14from where you can easily jump in to the 3-3 point.]
;W[qp];B[rp];W[mr];B[lr];W[mp];B[lp];W[nq];B[lq];W[or];B[rr]
C[More submissiveness. Before doing this you should jump out to Q6. Depending on how white answers this move in the corner may not be necessary, so it is worth finding out white's response.

(And I think that your correct move round here is R2, taking slightly more territory.)]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[gq]C[I am not sure about this white move.   On the one hand it is probably going to isolate the black group in the middle of the side whic becomes a weak group.

On the other hand the white invading group will also be weak, and the white group on the right does not completely have two eyes, so perhaps it will be one weak black group between two weak white groups, which ought to be good for black.

Then again, if all those groups just live, then black has been chopped up into little groups. Perhaps the two groups in the top left are equal, the two groups in the bottom right are equal, the two gronps in the middle of the bottom edge are equal. So the black group in the bottom left and the black group on the rigth side, have to equal the white territory at the top plus komi. I think that favours white. So balack would actually have to gain some positive benefit from the fighting.

Another option to consider would be the capping move at G5. After that white might have to live small on the edge, whilst black gets thickness. Then black might be able to threaten the white group in the bottom right. It will almost certainly live, but black can use this to build even more thickness in the middle. Then black plays C12 to make a moyo on the left. C12 might also make white think about the status of the white group in the top left. That would be a completely different game. And, of course, it may not go to plan.]
;B[eq];W[go];B[dn]C[There is nothing terribly wrong with this move, but the corner is probably safe without it. You could consider strengthening your weak group with L7 instead. Or, if you are feeling aggressive you could think about the cap at G7, but that might be an overplay.]
;W[ir]C[This is not such a good white move. OK, it reduces black's eye-shape on the edge, but is does not actually gain white much. Black can just jump out.]

(;B[in]C[Jumping out is the right idea, but this is just a bit feeble. It is not a terribly good shape for black. White can just jump to G7, and I don't see what you are doing next.

If you knew that white was going to jump to G7, you would probably rather that you had played the horses-neck jump to L7, which is good shape for you. Furthermore, L7 puts pressure on the white group on the right as well as the one on the left, so you should then be able to threaten that group and in the process strengthen your group. If white answered L7 by defending on the right, then you could cap at G7 on the left.

But what I want to do here is to peep at H4 then cap, see the variation.]
;W[io];B[jo]C[You don't have to block solidly. L6 might be a lighter alternative. (bit it may not be any good, I haven't really thought about it.]
;W[jn]
(;B[kn]C[This is very crude.   In this sort of position, if you play atari on one side, then you hurt your stones on the other. Since white can't caputure your cutting stone (unless you you make him stronger by playing atari) just leave it for now and find a move nearby that you want to play anyway, and which make white worry about your ataris. If you keep you options (choice of atari) open something may end up working in the future. Or, at least white has got to keep worrying about that possiblility.]
;W[jm];B[hn]C[Do you really know what you are doing? Unless you do, I see no reason to comit yourself to saving this stone yet. Solve some of your other problems first.]
;W[ho];B[gn];W[fn];B[fm];W[gm]
(;B[fo]C[Now this next bit, again I have to ask "do you know what you are doing?" This kind of atari-atari-atari stuff, it's a bit like a ladder. You have to read it out all the way to the end and be sure that you are happy with the result, otherwise you shouldn't even start. Of course it is rather harder to read out than a ladder.

If you take joseki as representitive of good play, then you see this sort of hacky stuff in three situations:

1) failure diagrams, where one side has messed up, and is about to get splatted.

2) sequences where one side has calculaded that it is possible to sacrifice a few stones in exchange for a good squeeze, and the other player has calculated that the territory from capturing the stones is worth as much as the thickness.

3) horrible stuff like the tiasha that you really don't want to get into, and where it has taken professionals many years to sort out the good and bad moves.

Of course sometimes you don't realise what you have got into until it is too late. Then you have to stop as soon as possible and then work out a line that you are pretty sure leads to a result that you are happy with. Bear in mind that you are probably looking for something that you can profitably sacrifice, in order to keep the reading managable.

But randomly thrashing around, which is what it looks like you are doing to me, but I admit that I could easily be wrong, is not good enough. It is as bad as playing out a ladder without reading it to the end.

So what is possible here? let's look at some variations.];W[en]

(;B[hm];W[gl];B[hl];W[em];B[gk];W[fl];B[fr];W[fp];B[eo];W[gr]
;B[fq];W[kr];B[ls]C[Another move that looks slack to me. Surely you should play the atari one to the right. It weakens the white group there, and makes some eye-shape for you.]

;B[bl];W[bs];B[cl];W[es];B[dk]C[The important stones here are the three cutting stones around E7, if you play one to the right you make sure of capturing them in a single move.]
;W[km];B[el];W[ln];B[hr];W[ci]
(;B[fj]C[This is not a full-value move. You have the 3 cutting stones captured anyway, the other 3 don't really matter.

A count of the score before this move seems to suggest that you are about 15 points behind, but that is assuming that the whole of the top right is white territory, and therefore 15 points.

So you need to do something (rather than just playing out the endgame). This first thing that comes to mind is the white group in the lower right. Does it really have two eyes yet? if not, can you gain any profit by attacking?

The other option is to go to work on the rather thin white territory at the top.]
;W[nh];B[ph]C[This is another really feeble move. If you were 20 points ahead and trying to wrap the game up it would be fine, but you are behind, you have to try something more exciting.]
;W[rk];B[rj];W[pk];B[qj];W[oj];B[gc]C[Again, you can't really play moves like this when you are behind.]
