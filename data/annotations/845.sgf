;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[ip];W[qn];B[nq]LB[np:a]C[This is inconsistent with the Chinese
opening, which aims at a balance of influence and territory.  Should be
at 'a'];W[rp]
(;B[qq]LB[ql:a]C['a' is much better.  See
variation.];W[fq]LB[dq:a][dn:b][kq:c][lq:d][ir:e]C[bridges: I didn't
know quite how to respond to this. D3 and E3 came to mind, but I opted
for E4 instead.
  SGF:  'a' is my initial reaction.  If W jumps out then Bb is adequate.  If W comes in at 'c' or 'fd' then he is in trouble after
Be.];B[ep];W[fp];B[fo]LB[eo:a]C[SGF: This is dangerous.  'a' is better.]
;W[dr];B[dq]LB[eo:a]C[SGF: 'a' is more solid.  THe ouside is
bigger.];W[cr];B[hr]LB[go:a]C[SGF: Contradictory.  B start out by trying
t oseal W in and now switches to trying to take away eye space. 'a'
looks good.];W[hq];B[iq];W[hp]LB[ho:A][cf:B][on:C][qk:D]C[bridges: At
this point I didn't have to respont to H4, though I probably SHOULD
have  played at H5 (A), confining white tightly, etc, and threatening to
kill
 him if he didn't respond. Instead, I decided to tenuki, and considered
B, C, and D. I choose B because it was a nice extension from my bottom
stones, though D was perhaps a better move, since white had left those
 botttom stones without a strong base.];B[cf]LB[ho:a][gr:b]
[ir:c][er:d][in:e]C[SGF:  H4 is ESSENTIAL.  Without
it all of Bs moves go to waste.  Moreover, it is sente. After 'a' thru
'd' B can connect at 'e' for tremndous thickness.];W[gr]LB[hn:a]
C[bridges: I can ignore this at the cost of  leaving a
white gote move at J2 or a white invasion point at K2.
  SGF:  wrong direction.  B did not seal W in so W should jump out to
'a'];B[fc]C[SGF: B is leaving a lot of W stones at the bottom.  You
should always strength your own stones before
attacking.];W[ee];B[ic]LB[cc:a]C['a' is standard after the double
kakari];W[cj]LB[eg:A][di:B][cl:C][bd:a][cc:b][ch:c]C[bridges: I figured I could
respond to this at A, B, or C. I'm still not sure which I should have
played. A attacks the white stones at the top, B pushes white toward my
stones at the bottom, and C pushes them towards my
 stones at the bottom. In retrospect, A and C are probably better than
B.   SGF:  stabilizing the b stones with Bd, We, Bf is probably most
important. The W pincer is one point too far away.];B[eg]LB[ch:a]
C[This does not make good shape.  THere is a weakness
at  'a' to exploit in case W gets in to trouble on the left.  Also,
because B did not seal W in his stones at the bottom are weak so he
cannot afford two weak groups.];W[ge]LB[di:A][cl:B][ej:a]C[bridges :
Here, B seems better than A, though I chose to play A, and establish a
more space for my stones on the top left.

SGF:  B does not really have a good shape move. I would be inclined to
play at 'c' and make W  live on the side while sealing him in.]
;B[di]C[SGF: This seems to have no meaning.  If it is to attack it is on
the wrong side.  If it is to defend it doesn't seem to make good
shape.];W[cm];B[cn]LB[bn:a][bo:b]C[bridges : I didn't want to let white
connect, or slide to B5, and decided this was probably the best way to
do so.

SGF:  contact plays usually strengthen the opponent so this cannot be
good.  'a' and 'b' would serve the same purpose.  'a' threatens the side
more directly but 'b'  has a greater effect on the corner incase W
getting into trouble with the W20 stones.];W[em];B[en];W[bn]
;B[co]LB[bo:a]C[B should play at 'a' and fight a ko
if W ataris];W[ho]LB[fm:a][bl:b]C[This group is alive. W must stabilize
his side group. 'a' is a good point, 'b' is W is timid.];B[fm]
;W[el];B[io];W[hm];B[fl];W[ej];B[ek]LB[dk:a]C[This doesn;t help B
much. 'a' is a much better point to aim
at.];W[dk];B[fk];W[dj];B[ci];W[fi];B[cd]LB[bl:a][gg:b]C[bridges: I liked this move, but fouled up my
response,    SGF: W is still not alive on the left. B can aim at 'a'.  Keeping W
separated with 'b' is a playable approach.  There is nothing wrong with
the move played however.];W[de]LB[cc:a]C[Terrible shape. W must play
'a'.];B[df]LB[ce:A][cc:a]C[bridges: Should DEFINITELY have been at A
instead.
  SGF:  Or maybe at 'b'.];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[af]LB[bg:a]C[Bad shape.  Just give W 'a' for free.  A solid connection is best.]
;W[cc];B[lc];W[dn];B[do];W[dm];B[bo];W[bm]LB[qk:A]C[All of these moves
seem small compared to the right side, like A.];B[bj];W[bq]
;B[eq];W[er];B[gn];W[hn];B[hk]LB[gg:a]C['a' is better.  B is not completedly alive on the
side and neither is W.  'a' is more effective  in keeping the W stones
isolated.];W[gg];B[gi]LB[fh:a][gh:b]C[This can never work because W just
connects at 'a'.  B should be aiming at cutting off these stones. B
shoulkd play at 'a'.  If W71, Bb follow then W is risking a lot if he
blocks.];W[fh];B[fj];W[ei]C[SGF:  This exchange weakens B, so he must
respond on the side in gote];B[dh]LB[bh:a]C['a' is better shape.]
;W[hi]LB[jm:a][qk:b]C[Too direct. B can easily run away.   An indirect
threat like 'a' is a better idea.  However, 'b' is the big point at this
stage.];B[hj];W[gh]LB[ii:a]C['a' is correct shape];B[gj]C[No need to
connect.  Save is as a ko threat for later and just jump
out.];W[bh];B[bg];W[ad];B[ae];W[bk];B[bi];W[gm]LB[ql:a]C[bridges: I probably should have ignored this, but
I decided that G8 gave me two real eyes, and let me not have to worry
about that group at all in the future.
  SGF: True. 'a' is the best point.];B[gl];W[go];B[fn];W[qi]
C[bridges:
but white got this move in place.];B[qf];W[nc];B[rd];W[qc];B[rh]
LB[of:a]C[This just 'feels' bad.  After
93 thereis not good follow up.  B93 shuold have been at 'a']
;W[ri];B[of]C[All that the 95-96 exchange has done for B is to make an
invasion of the side
harder.];W[ne];B[nf];W[rc];B[re];W[qh];B[rg];W[pk]C[This is very
unsatisfactory for B.  The 2 low moves at 93 and 95 just solidified W at
the top and the side.  When invading in the opponents area of influence
you shooul jump away lightly and try to preserve optinos to invade
later.];B[sf]LB[on:a]C[bridges: this was too slow. N15 would have worked
better, both confining white and connecting if white played here to keep
me from having two eyes directly.

SGF: N15 would be a nice move, but 'a' looks bigger.];W[rq]
;B[on]C[THese two moves were miai, but W would have more potential by
playing 107];W[pm]LB[kn:a]C[Not really needed. 'a' is
nice.];B[om];W[ol];B[me]LB[jm:a]C[After the last two moves, 'a' is
mandatory.];W[nd]C[Very small.];B[mb];W[nh]LB[ob:a]C[Has to block. 'a'
threatens the whole group,];B[mg]C[why?  both sides are alive so why connect
them?];W[nl];B[mn];W[km];B[ob];W[nb];B[na];W[pb];B[ko]LB[oc:a]
C['a'
captured at least 4 stones and will kill them all if W is not
careful.];W[oc];B[oa];W[pa];B[ma];W[mc];B[kb];W[pe];B[pf];W[oe]

are all much bigger.];W[kf];B[kg];W[gc];B[gb];W[hc];B[hb];W[je]

the marked moves];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[oi];B[ir]C[bridges: In retrospect, S2 was much
bigger than this, which was now probably not even an invasion point.]
;W[qr];B[pr];W[qp];B[pq];W[qs]C[Just connect.  THen the hane is sente]
;B[ps];W[rr];B[ik];W[jl];B[jn];W[po];B[oo];W[sd];B[se];W[sc]
;B[ng];W[pg];B[og]LB[ni:a][nj:b][qg:c]C[If B captures at 'a' then 'b' and 'c'
are miai];W[qg];B[ni];W[nj];B[pn];W[qo]C[bridges: and now, if I had had s2
instead of J2, white would have been in more trouble on the left because
of thedouble hane at Q6.

understand this on white's part. K7 gets him one point, while M7 gets me
two.];B[lm];W[jm];B[mf];W[dg];B[cg]C[bridges: should have just connected at
E12. Threw away a point];W[eh];B[dg];W[hl];B[tt];W[nh]C[bridges: Didn't see this ko before I
passed. I had counted myself ahead, but I can't afford to miss these.]

after];B[lb];W[nh]C[bridges: And decided I didn't feel like fighting it
since it was getting late, I wanted to go to sleep, and I was ahead.]

(;B[ql];W[qq];B[qo];W[ro];B[pn];W[pm];B[qm];W[rn];B[on]C[This is much
better for B in this game.  The corner is small because when all the
opening stones are high a moyo game is more important.  W can try to
pull out W14 if he wishes but it could be dangerous,]))
