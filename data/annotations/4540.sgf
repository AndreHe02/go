[[Hello - my name's Adam, and I'll be reviewing this game.  My comments will be in double brackets.  I'm only a 9 kyu myself, so I certainly can't pretend that I know the "right" move in every position that follows.  My remarks are intended merely to highlight some of the issues at play at various points in the game and to stimulate your own thinking about it.  I hope you find them helpful!\]\]

[[For those reading this on GTL, this review was requested by Black, and so that is to whom my comments are addressed, though I have commented on the White moves as well.\]\]]
;B[qp]C[AlgizGebo [19k\]: enjoy];W[dp];B[pd]C[Jaydee [19k\]: thanks, you too]
;W[dc];B[nq];W[ci]C[[[Wow, it's pretty rare that *White* gets to play a Chinese opening...\]\]]
;B[pj];W[jq]C[[[At this point I would take stock of where you stand so far.  This looks like it's turning out to be a Clash of the Moyos game.  Such games often favor Black, but in this case it looks like White is on the road to marking off a beefier moyo, whereas your position is somewhat flatter.  In the variations I've suggested some alternative possibilities for move 9 that you should have at least considered.\]\]]

(;B[fc]C[[[This is an unusual approach move and is considered to be from the "wrong direction" because it doesn't prevent White from making a corner enclosure.  In the variations I've shown a couple of the josekis that follow such an approach.\]\]]

(;W[ee]C[[[An unusual reply.\]\]];B[hd]TR[ic][jd]C[[[Why such a short extension?  One of the triangled points would be more usual.\]\]]
;W[cf];B[lc]TR[jc][nc]C[[[Note that White can still sneak in at one of the triangled points later on.\]\]]
;W[pg]C[I have trouble with this move.  Can you please show standard answers to this type of play?

[[I've attached a couple of possible follow-ups, but this looks like a good spot to do some thinking.\]\]

[[What do you want to accomplish here?\]\]

[[Do you think that White has invaded "your" territory and that you have to kill the invading stone somehow?  That seems like a tall order.  Much as it might look otherwise after move 13, you don't own the right side: putting Black stones on two adjacent star points is not enough to claim the space in between.  (If it were, there'd be no way for White to win a 9-stone handicap game.)\]\]

[[On the other hand, think about this: what does *White* expect to accomplish?  That's a pretty lonely-looking stone with no room to simply extend up the side.  It looks like it's going to have to either run into the middle or try to help pincer one of your other stones.\]\]

Here I tried to not attach, but it was not very successful.

[[You were correct not to attach here.  Touching an enemy stone strengthens both your position and the enemy's.  But you're already strong here!  You want to hem White in, not give White a chance to play all sorts of extensions and dodges, which is what happens when you attach.\]\]]

(;B[nf]TR[oe]C[[[This move is questionable because the stone you've just placed doesn't relate to your other stones very well.  The closest friendly stone is the one at 4-4, but that's a bad shape that is just asking to be cut at the triangled point.  Some other ideas are below.\]\]]
;W[nh]C[[[Questionable.  You can't really run with a keima.\]\]]
;B[oh];W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[Did I block on the correct side?

[[Well, here are some things to keep in mind as you're deciding.\]\]

[[First of all, do you have enough support in the corner to be able to kill the invading stones?  Nope.  White is going to be able to take some territory either on the top or on the right.\]\]

[[On the right White has a stone to try to connect up with.  On the top, no such problem.  That suggests that you chose correctly.\]\]

[[On the other hand, the worst scenario would be if White took the top and then used the Q13 stone to somehow take the right as well.  If you're going to block on this side, you'd better be very sure that Q13 is effectively captured.\]\]

[[I see you've included some variations here, so I'll comment on them as well.\]\]]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb]TR[nf]C[[[Realize that you're only getting away with this many hanes because of the triangled stone.\]\]]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[ni];B[nk]
(;W[qh]C[[[You're lucky White didn't seem to know what to do here.  See the variation for one way White could've put a dent in your position.\]\]]
;B[og]C[[[Good.  As the Offspring say, you gotta keep 'em separated.]
;W[qk];B[qj]C[[[Good.\]\]];W[qn];B[ql]TR[qk]C[Here it seemed attachment was effective, so I am confused

[[Ah ha - but in this case you touched a stone that *you were already touching*.  It wasn't an attachment out of nowhere.  White seemed to think that a two-space extension on the third line was safe, but the triangled stone was smashed up against an iron pillar!\]\]

[[The proverb "don't attack with contact" means that first you must *contain* the enemy (which is very hard to do with contact) and only then do you go in for the kill, if possible.  In this case, White is already pretty confined.  And even so I might  consider playing something like P5 instead.\]\]

[[And another thing to think about: *was* it really effective?  Yes, you captured the triangled stone, but R6 managed to escape.\]\]]
;W[no]C[[[I started to write some move-by-move comments here, but I think I'd rather just talk about the fights that follow in general terms.\]\]

[[In go, you can't have everything.  Unless White plays very poorly, you're not going to be able to keep R6 from connecting with R9 *and* keep it from connecting with O5 *and* keep White out of your corner all at the same time.  What you want to do is keep White on the run - *while* you make a profit.  That's why I suggested P5 instead of R8 earlier - while White scrambles to make a tiny life, you make your corner invulnerable and get a wall on the outside that you can use to project power over on the left side.\]\]

[[Which is another thing.  Look at where you've been playing: exclusively on "your" side of the board.  Has every White move threatened to do so much damage that you *had* to respond instead of threatening some damage of your own on the left side?\]\]]
;B[on]TR[po]C[[[Looks like you want to cut off R6.  White's potential cut at the triangled point makes that uncertain.\]\]]
;W[op]
(;B[pq]C[[[Hang on - did you want to cut off R6 or not?  This was your chance!  (See the variation.)  If you were more concerned about keeping O3 connected, you could've played P4 yourself earlier...\]\]]
;W[po]
(;B[qo]C[[[This just forces White to connect at Q6, endangering your stone at P6.  Otake Hideo calls this a "family feud."  The variation would have been better.\]\]]

(;B[bn]C[we discussed this move, AligizGEbo thinks it should be the alternate and I do agree

[[Yes.  There's a principle that recommends that players "make box-like territories."  There's another principle that says that you should be very wary of playing on the second line before the endgame.\]\]]
;W[en]C[[[And of course this is just devastating.  It is a perfect go move: it dramatically expands White's potential territory while dramatically restricting yours.\]\]]

(;B[lj]C[[[Remember, you want to do two things at once: put pressure on your opponent, and make profit yourself.  This move does the former but not the latter.  See the variation.\]\]]

(;B[mj]C[I should be able to kill this white group - but how?

[[Why do you think you should be able to kill it?\]\]

[[Let me put it this way.  There are two ways a group can keep from being killed.  One is to make two eyes.  The other is to "connect to life" - that is, to hook up to a friendly group that's already alive.\]\]

[[This White group is only one move away from connecting to life.  If you want to kill it, you have no choice but to sever that connection.  But at this point, even that won't help.  See the variations.\]\]]

[[Remember - keep your groups connected; keep enemy groups split apart.\]\]

[[I see you've worked out some variations here - I'll add some comments to those as well.\]\]]

(;B[jd];W[ie]LB[ke:A][jf:B][jg:B][jh:B]TR[je]C[[[In capturing races, count the liberties.  To win, you have to capture the triangled stones.  That group has three liberties.  To win, White only needs to capture your stone A, which has two liberties.  So you need to save stone A by playing something like L16 or M16.  But then White can play J14, adding a liberty to the triangled group while taking one away from your group B.\]\]

[[In other words, you've already lost the race.  So save what you can. You've still got territory at the top.  Save it.  J16 would be a good move here.\]\]]
