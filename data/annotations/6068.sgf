C[Hello, my name is Bernd Sambale. I'm living in Germany and I started playing in September 2006.

I'd like to have some advice about the thinking in large scale ko-fights, because I don't really know what to do, when a ko starts (as you will see in the game), and maybe some hints how to overcome the kind of panic which haunts you in a game of Go, which blinds you so, that you make nonsensical moves. 

 For convenience I added Bs to my comments.

Thank you! ^_^];B[pd];W[oo];B[dp];W[ee];B[jj];W[jd];B[dd];W[ed]

;B[bg];W[bh];B[be];W[nc]LB[ci:A][cn:B]C[Chris: Not too bad for white. A is honte, but slow, B also possible for very fast development.]
;B[oc]C[Chris: Bad move by black. White gets ideal extension, strong shape. Blacks corner can still be invaded.]
;W[nd];B[qf];W[nf]LB[fq:A]C[Chris: Not urgent. Maybe A?];B[ch]
C[Chris: Bad by Black. White sacrifices for super-thickness.]

(;W[dh];B[ci];W[di];B[cj]C[Chris: Pushing from behind is bad. The terretory on the third line is enough compensation since the tengen stone hinders whites development.]
;W[dj];B[ck]
(;W[jh]C[Chris: Do not use thickness to make terretory, make thickness to attack. White is behind and should stirr up some trouble.]
;B[lg]LB[nf:B][jh:A]C[B.: This invasion seemed too deep to me.

Chris: This is not even an invasion, just a normal reduction. Draw a line through A and B (which are the boundary stones of your little moyo) and you see the Black reduction stone is exactly on the line. A textbook reduction.
White can not do much but to separate the 2 Black stones and hope for a good attack on one of the 2 groups.]
;W[nh]C[Chris: Bad, helping Black connect his 2 stones.];B[li]
;W[le]C[Chris: Very bad, there is not enough terretory here and *no* white groups are in danger?  Be more active! Approach the lower left corner now instead...]
;B[hh];W[jf]LB[jh:A]C[Chris: I really do not have a clue what White is doing there. What is so special about A? Why connect useless stones?]
;B[gj];W[lk]C[B.: Maybe this was an overplay? Since he didn't guard, it turned out fine for me, but he should have bumped and connected, right?

Chris: If anything, cut at A, but I dont think anything good would come from it. To me the game looks lost for white.]
;B[mj];W[kj];B[ki];W[ji];B[ij];W[lm];B[nj]C[Chris: Heavy group. Now theres a chance for white to catch up.]

;W[mf];B[pg]C[B.: I saw that I didnt have a real chance to kill him anymore, so I decided to claim the bottom right corner.
Chris: You should have at *least* kept him separated. Even if he lives, it will be 15 easy points in yose.]
;W[pl];B[qh];W[pq];B[nq]C[B.: I thought: What is this!?];W[kq]
C[Chris: Good! This is correct. The more he tries to make seomthing of this stone, the weaker his centre group becomes.]
;B[iq];W[ko];B[io];W[cq]C[Chris: Good timing.];B[dq];W[cp];B[co]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[do]C[Chris: ??]
;W[el]C[B.: I intended to reduce his freshly built moyo, I thought my wall was solid enough for it.
Chris: You shouldt think about reducing him in such a way that will attack is centre a bit, so hell get afraid]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[fc];W[gb];B[fh]C[B.: Here I thought that he either cuts at E14 or E10. But I could have guarded my position with E12, right?]

(;W[fj]C[B.: I let him cut off the bigger part, because I thought I had a good chance vs. his group. But maybe the stones on the J-line were too close?

Chris: This is completely thought process. Let him have 2 stones and use their aji to reduce a lot or similar. Why would you]
;B[ef];W[gd];B[fe];W[fd];B[fg];W[eg]C[Chris: Bad, takes away a liberty.]
;B[ff];W[gl]LB[gk:A]C[Chris: A is the shape.];B[gk];W[hl];B[jl]
;W[im];B[jm];W[jn];B[in]C[B.: Here he was cut off, but I also was, and now as it stood on the board, I thought, his chances to survive were much bigger than mine.

Chris: This is a bad situation. Better play as in the variation before.]

;W[ej];B[fl];W[fm];B[em]C[B.: I saw this coming, but I didnt see a way to prevent it.

Chris: Quote "I let him cut off the bigger part, because I thought I had a good chance vs. his group". If you catch yourself thinking these things in a game, but the game proceeds like this, where an "everything or nothing" situation arises, maybe its a good time to start changing the thought-process during the game? Self analysis of a game can very helpful.]
;W[gp];B[fq];W[gq]
(;B[jo];W[kn];B[ho];W[go];B[fn];W[gn];B[hq];W[gr]C[B.: But - round and round it went - he let me cut off his J-Stones. And this time my chances to survive seemed to be better. An eye for an eye ...

Chris: Mistake by black gives white a chance. Maybe black doesnt want to win?]
