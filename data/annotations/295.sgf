M[df]C[dada: interesting move (it immediatly splits w)
As the marked move is high, w will find it hard to settle his stone.
Another possibility would be to play at 'a' (f4)];W[cd];B[cc];W[ce];B[de]
;W[ef];B[fh]C[dada: good];W[ei];B[eh];W[di]C[dada: looks dangerous
W is too weak in this area to start a fight];B[ff];W[ej]C[dada: ??];B[cg]
C[dada: good];W[cf];B[bf]L[bg]C[dada: maybe playing at 'a' (b13) is better]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[bc];B[cb];W[be];B[bg];W[bb];B[ad]L[db]C[dada: B should  play at 'a' (d17) instead.
W then has to make life in gote and B can take another large point.
For W losing sente in a high handicap game is very bad.
This is a direct result of playing e11/d11 too soon.];W[db];B[eb];W[ca]

(;W[ae]C[dada: bad move
W is alive, even if B plays at a15 (see variation)];B[ci]L[fp]C[dada: not urgent
There are many other large points on the board, e.g. 'a' (f4)];W[dk];B[ck]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[cl];B[bk];W[bl]M[bj][bk][ck]C[dada: not really  sente (capturing the 3 marked stones is small)
As W has fallen behind in the upper left corner he should fight harder.
Attacking the lonely stone in the lower left corner seems better.];B[cn]
C[dada: good move!!];W[bi];B[ch];W[aj];B[dj];W[fe]C[dada: questionable ko threat
W helps B to build really impressive thickness there (ponnuki)];B[ge];W
[cj];B[cq]M[bj][bk][ck]C[dada: good choice again.
The 3 marked stones are worthless];W[ak]C[dada: W again taking gote here]
;B[gq]C[dada: B is satisfied
Instead of rescuing the 3 stones, she secured at least 20 points in the lower  left corner.
W has fallen behind even more.];W[nd]L[qf]C[dada: direction of this move is questionable
I would prefer playing at 'a' (r14)];B[lc]M[pd]L[pf][qf]C[dada: wrong direction.
B should use her thickness to fight, not to make territory.
The marked B stone is weak compared to the B group on the left, so B should  help this stone instead.
Playing at 'a' (q14) or 'b' (r14) is better.];W[qf];B[nc]C[dada: peaceful
B is far ahead, so she can afford to seal off her territory without fighting.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[pe];B[qd];W[qi]C[dada: W's shape looks thin
I once read (can't remember where) that playing diagonally under a stone on  the 4th line is almost always bad (unless you have a clear tactical aim).]
;B[qj]C[dada: good];W[ng]M[qi][qj]C[dada: W has to reinforce
Now it's clear, that the exchange of the marked stones was bad for W];B
[qn]C[dada: good];W[op]L[nq][or][lq]C[dada: lukewarm move
Other options are: 'a' (o3), 'b' (p2) or 'c' (m3)];B[oq];W[po];B[oo];W[np]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qq]C[dada: B is satisfied];W[no];B[om]L[nq]
C[dada: questionable
B should consider playing at 'a' (o3) instead.];W[nm];B[lq];W[nq];B[pi]
C[dada: good move];W[or];B[qh]M[qi]C[dada: capture of the marked stone is big]

(W again loses sente)];B[lm]L[fo][go]C[dada: 'a' (f5) or 'b' (g5) look bigger to me]
;W[rq]C[dada: small move (and gote!!)
W should reduce B's left corner];B[rp];W[rr];B[en]C[dada: good!];W[qm];B

[nk];W[sa]C[Summary:
W made a mistake in the upper left corner and never really recovered.
B played very solid, just securing her territory step by step.
W missed some chances and made several small captures and gote moves, which  in the end caused the large loss. B on her part was willing to sacrifice some  stones in order to play the big points - very good indeed!!

I guess every high kyu can learn two things from this game:
* if you're ahead, don't start fights (play peacefully and secure your  territory)
* sacrifice stones in order to take the big points (don't hang on to every  single stone)

(;W[ea]L[fa][fb]C[dada: playing at 'a' (f19) would  lead to a onesided ko in W's favour (W answers 'a' with 'b' (f18))
