C[If there is one thing you should remember from this game, it is: stay connected. When your stones are connected to each other, they can be defended more easily. When they are separated, you must defend each of the separate groups, and it's impossible. One rule of thumb: try to not have more than one weak group on the board. A weak group is a group that you have to worry about: will it live or be captured?
If you have two weak groups, and you cannot link them up, then decide which one you will defend, because one of them will die.


Second: do some life and death problems. In several occasions, you played where your group was already dead, or attempted to kill a black group that was alive. This increase your losses, and you lose the opportunity to play an important move elsewhere on the board. Learning to assess these situations takes time and effort, but it'll pay off eventually.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qn]C[Some other possible answers to this approach are in the variations.]

(;W[qq]C[Here I was hoping to secure the corner territory so I could play elsewhere with peace of mind.

Maere: You have some good thinking here: for once, securing territory is a good thing. Second, settling a situation before turning your attention elsewhere on the board, this is also good. But it's not your only concern. It's still very early in the game, and the board is huge. Lots of places to go. The best moves in this situation are the ones that have good potential for development.
What do I need with development? Well, if you look at the whole board, you''ve outlined some white area on the bottom. The potential of your Q4 stone is to develop along the bottom and make it yours.
The corner is important, but on its own it's not enough to win. So while playing, keep in mind that you also want to take your share at the bottom.

At the same time, do pay attention to where the potential of the opponent is. Here black has three stones starting to outline a large area of influence. You'll have to disrupt it at some point if you are to win the game. So be careful that it does not become too secure.]
;B[oo]
(;W[po]C[I didn't think black was going to press the attack on this corner, when he did, I wanted to try and split him, hoping to make him heavy.

Maere: Maere: In this case you are not making him heavy, you are making him solid. What's the difference? Well, heavy stones are inefficient. They are added in a place where they do not accomplish much. Now, look at the next move...]
;B[pn]C[This is good for black. He's building a wall. It will help him take the right side. When you let black take something, you should make sure you are taking something of your own in return. Here you are making a bad trade. The bottom is wide open. Not only do you risk losing your potential territory there, your corner group is also in danger of being cut off from its ally at D4. Being cut off is usually a bad thing, especially when the group is under attack.]
;W[on];B[nn];W[om];B[op];W[lp];B[pq];W[qp];B[oq];W[pm];B[qm]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[kn]C[At this point i wasn't sure if I should abandon the corner and play elsewhere. I'm not good at fighting.

Maere: only lots of practice will make you better at fighting. As a side advice: don't shy away from a good fight even if it might lose you the game, and assume you're alive as long as you haven't read out you're dead. You will lose more for a while because of bad decisions, but you will profit later when you've earned some fighting experience.

In this particular case, I'm frankly not sure if you can still live in the corner.

But as dangerous as the situation is, none of the two black groups are clearly alive either. I wouldn't give it up just now. Playing on the outside isn't a bad idea. At the very least, you can harass the two black groups and build a good position to compensate for your loss in the corner.]
;B[mp];W[cj]C[I really wouldn't tenuki here. As I said earlier, none of the groups are setlled yet, anything might happen. Leaving the fight gives your opponent a strong advantage.]
;B[pj]C[Here black is securing his position and running to the rescue of the three isolated black stones. And he's expanding his moyo in the process. If you'd kept fighting, you might even have captured those three stones instead.]
;W[iq]C[That's too shy. considering the black group at P3, it leaves too much open. M3 would be very safe and accomplish more.
N7 would be better though. It would prevent black from playing there: keeping the opponent cut off and linking your own groups together.]
;B[mm];W[cc]C[I think this was a mistake. I didn't know how to follow up this invasion.

Maere: giving up both P7 and Q4 groups is too painful to bear. That said, right now I'm not sure how you can run away. You can try attacking R7, but that group has a lot of support now. You should have kept fighting there earlier on. Playing these stones and then abandoning them isn't a good idea. You should try to make it so that your stones serve a purpose. Even if they die, you should try to get some profit from their death.

C7 is generally wrong timing. You get a little corner territory, but you're giving away the top as well. Why? Well, usually when you play this 3-3 invasion, black gets to build a wall while you get the corner. If you let him take this much, he'll make a too big benefit. 

Once you have made some more experience with the 3-3 invasion, you will learn not to play it that early in the game. It's best played towards the end of the middle game, to ruin a territory that hasn't been quite secured yet.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce]C["Hane at the head of two stones" How can I respond to this?

Maere: the 3-3 invasion has standard answers. Have a look at the most usual sequence in the variation.]

(;W[de];B[df];W[ee];B[be];W[cf];B[dg];W[cg];B[bb]
(;W[ef]C[You've made some mistakes, but so did your opponent. Since you've pushed him this far, you should go ahead and capture those two stones. It will allow you to link up your three weak groups together and recover from this situation.]
;B[eg];W[gg];B[ff];W[fe];B[fg];W[ge];B[fi];W[ek]C[You're trying to broadly defend your area against black. It's too early for this. Keep helping out your stones in the corner. If you can take away the corner in this situation, you will have ruined black's area at the top. E9 isn't nearly as profitable.]
;B[di]
(;W[gf]C[You should definitely play D11 here. You can't let your stones be cut off.]
;B[dj];W[gj];B[ch]
(;W[ci]C[It's too late to try and link up. The D13 group has lost one too many liberty. Blocking at D9 is more efficient, protecting you bottom left territory.]
;B[bh];W[dk];B[bg];W[ck];B[ej]
(;W[dm]C[You have more urgent moves. G11 would help your G15 group, which is not alive yet.
E17, while it will not save your two stones in the corner, would also help G15 and grind down many black prospects at the top.]
;B[fh];W[gh];B[gi];W[qc]C[For the same reasons as before, this move isn't a good idea at this point.]
;B[pc];W[pf]C[That stone can too easily be separated from R17. Your R17 stone needs help. You shouldn't abandon it right after you've played it.]
;B[nd];W[ne];B[oe];W[og]C[Once again, your stones can be too easily separated. R17, O15 and the Q14-P13 group will have to fare each on their own.
If you had played those four stones so that they could work together, your position would be much easier to defend.]
;B[nf];W[me];B[ph];W[pg];B[ng];W[pe];B[qd];W[ni];B[nh];W[ml]
C[You're going back to those stones that you previously abandonned, but the ones you previously played at Q13 are also still insecure. This is the result of having too many weak groups. You can't help them all and you don't know which one to protect.]
;B[ll];W[nl];B[km];W[of]C[Was this a mistake?

Maere: Well, it does cut black's O14 and O16 groups - as long as your Q13 group lives. The question is, can it live? It's cut off and has no live shape. That move doesn't help you to live, and if the group dies it's pointless an only adds to your losses. Your priority here is to make life, so any move that gives you some space to make eyes, or a chance to connect with other groups. This move does neither.]
;B[od];W[oh];B[oi];W[nj];B[nk];W[jm];B[kl];W[pl];B[ok];W[ql]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[rn];W[oj];B[pi];W[eh]C[Are you trying to kill this group? You can't, it's alive.]
;B[mi];W[mj];B[mk];W[lj];B[lk];W[li];B[mh];W[lh];B[qk];W[mg]
;B[pk];W[mf]C[There is no need to capture at tha point. Those black stones are yours. This move is better used elsewhere, for example at the top, or at M3 to rpotect your bottom territory.]
;B[ol]C[That was also unnecessary for black to capture right now.]
;W[nh]C[Another unnecessary move. Black van't cut here. If you're trying to make eyes, that too isn't necessary at this point because those stones have a way out to your G15 group. Two eyes is important for isolated groups.]
;B[qb]
(;W[om]C[You can't kill this group. It can make an eye in the area of S10 if it needs to. The capture at S7 would also give it an eye. It's secure.]
;B[md]C[Playing there would have been much better for you. Many points are still unclaimed at the top.]
;W[hi]C[Not so important. You won't make that many points in the center. Try to wall off the sides first.]
;B[fj];W[fk];B[ik];W[hk];B[gl];W[bi];B[ai];W[aj];B[ah]
(;W[cb];B[ca];W[bd];B[ad]
(;W[db];B[ec];W[eb]C[Was there any way to save this corner?
Maere: at this stage, I don't see how. Capturing the two black stones way earlier would have worked, though.]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[ic];B[gb];W[af]C[Here I was thinking I could pressure A16 and B15, and save my corner.

Maere: it's too late for that.You can't achieve anything with that move because the stones at C14 are in atari.]
;B[bf];W[ed];B[fa]C[At this point I realizing I couldn't save my corner, and I wasn't sure where to develop next.

Maere: When thinking where to play next, think urgent first, then big. "Urgent" refers to a fight going on for example. Any place where one of your groups or one of the opponent groups is in danger of dying is for example urgent.
If nothing is urgent, you look at the big points. Try and think in terms of area size. For example the whole bottom left corner, the empty area at the top. Then wonder: is this probably mine? Probably black? Or still neither black nor white? Big areas that are neither black nor white are your best bet. Of course it's only a rough orientation, but it should help you out for now.

In this case, you can either turn to the center-top area, or try and secure the bottom left. You're behind right now, so just defending what you've got isn't going to win the game. I would play at the top first, but keep in mind that black can at any opportunity go and reduce your bottom left, or invade at san-san. Calculating when to go back and defend is one of those subtles things that make go such a hard game ;-)]

(;W[kp]C[You'll have to be more greedy than that to win the game. If you're going to play in that area, go for M3.]
;B[kd];W[ij];B[jk];W[ih];B[gk];W[hl];B[hm];W[gm];B[il];W[fl]
;B[id];W[em]C[Playing here is unnecessary. You're letting black have the top, which is huge.]
;B[qf];W[jd];B[jc];W[im];B[hn]C[You've got to respond to this. However H5 isn't the way to do it. Those two stones are cut off and lonely, they will die by themselves if you deny them a place to live. You don't need to play directly in contact to do that. First protect your weaknesses(L6), then cut off the way to the corner and sides, and make sure your own stones stay connected to each other. That should be quite enough to deal with this invasion.]

(;W[je];B[hc];W[ld];B[le];W[lc];B[kc];W[lb]C[You can't live here.]

If he doesn't answer you, the corner is yours, so he can't ignore you. While he spends stones securing an area he already has, you are developping an advantage at the top, an area he has certainly be eyeing at.

There are other, more complicated variations possible. You can look them up at http://senseis.xmp.net/?44Point33InvasionJoseki]
