C[Hello!

My name is Frank and I'll be reviewing your game.  I will prefix my comments [Frank\].

I think this game was a nice, thoughtful game.  The thing that seemed to come up often was that you were only focused on the goal right ahead of you (for example, "make this group live!" or "stop the moyo!").  You should keep those goals in mind, but look for moves that can do more (for example, "make the group live while running and attacking!").  Anyway, nice game!

I hope this review helps and if you have any questions, let me know!

Frank


Hi! Firstly, thank you very much for taking your time to review my game.

I played this no-komi game on IGS some days ago. I think fuseki is one of the weakest parts of my game, so from the beginning I feel my opponent is already much stronger than me. Maybe sometimes that's just psychological, but more often than not I have to struggle in the midgame to turn the tables. In this game I was behind and couldn't recover, and even made a fatal mistake in the endgame.

What would you recommend to improve in general? Do you believe studying joseki (in the right way) could improve my game, at this level? Or do you think studying the fundamentals is still more important? I'm trying to play and solve life & death regularly, so I'm curious about your advice on that. Any other observations are very welcome.

Thanks again!];B[pp];W[dp];B[pc];W[dd];B[fc]
(;W[qe]TR[hc][ic][hd][id]C[I decided to approach the other corner so that black wouldn't develop a big moyo easily.

[Frank\] I don't mind your idea.  You can also try pincer if you want to keep it within the realm of a single joseki (as opposed to balancing two joseki sequences that need to work in concert).]
;B[ph]
(;W[ne]C[[Frank\] Not a bad choice.  That said, this joseki has some deeper implications.  It usually involves playing for influence or setting up pincers.]
;B[mc]
(;W[qc]LB[ne:A]TR[qe][pj]C[[Frank\] The scale is less of an issue here.  It is more about how to follow up the stone marked "A".  I added some common followups as variations.  The problem with your move is just that it's a bit too soon.  You can make some trades on the outside first.


I believe this is a mistake. I wanted to create a base for my stones, but this is small scale and strenghts black.]
;B[qb]
(;W[rc];B[pd];W[pe]C[Black has sente, better shape and more territory than white.]
;B[cf];W[jc]C[Wanted to leave some aji here, maybe try to separate the black groups.

[Frank\] The best way to leave aji is to not play there. Black could ignore you now and seal in your corner.]

(;B[kc]C[[Frank\] Silly move for black...];W[df]C[[Frank\] Good to come out now!]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[ce]
(;W[ed];B[hc];W[kd];B[kb];W[eg]TR[cg]C[[Frank\] I agree that this is a bad move.  Playing here is ajikeshi since black protects the cut for free.]

(;B[dh]TR[he]C[I think I helped black again here, pushing from behind and giving him fourth line territory. On the other hand, if black played at E13, it would be bad for white.

[Frank\] If you are looking to protect, you should instead just jump out. It takes you where you want to go without helping your opponent.]

(;W[nq]TR[ne][pe][qe][ph]C[[Frank\] My first inclination is to play against the marked stone in order to make use of your wall.  See variation.]
;B[qm]TR[ph]C[[Frank\] Now I feel it will be hard to mount a useful attack on the marked stone.]
;W[iq];B[ld]C[[Frank\] Small for black...];W[pj]TR[oe]C[Now that black is much stronger at the top, this move does not seem so good now. Also, white isn't alive yet and has weak points.

[Frank\] This attack is not a bad idea.  Perhaps a bit late, though.  In attacking, you can force black to play dame while settling your group.]
;B[of];W[oe];B[qj]C[Black attacks and creates territory at the same time.

[Frank\] I don't see the attack.  That is just a single stone you can abandon.  Your top right corner can survive easily by making life locally or running out.  I would tenuki.]

(;W[qi];B[pi];W[ri]C[[Frank\] This move seems strange.  I think you are overly concerned with the life of your corner.  I think it's quite alive without this.]
;B[qk];W[qg]C[White lives small, but I thought I still could get a good result if I were able to develop the framework at the bottom.]
;B[nh];W[ck]TR[iq]C[Played at the last open big point on the board, and put some pressure on the black group on the left. Was this the right time? Was there any other urgent, more important move?

[Frank\] Not a bad idea to play this now.  I would prefer a knights move instead though.  If you play this way, it's too easy for black to make a choice.  He should go 3-3 without thinking.  Anytime your opponent has double wing from star point, it is almost always a good idea to invade 3-3.]

(;B[ci]C[I believe this answer was passive.

[Frank\] Correct.  There is no danger.]
(;W[cn]TR[ci]C[I prefered to answer with a secure move too.

[Frank\] Not a bad result for white since black played that small move.]
;B[dq]
(;W[eq];B[cp];W[cq]C[I'd wanted to try to kill black's invasion, but maybe I shouldn't have. What are good alternatives here?

[Frank\] Protect from inside, then attack :)];B[dr];W[er];B[bq]
;W[cr];B[do];W[ds];B[co]TR[ck][cn]C[Now the two stones are separated and weak, but black's group at C5 isn't much stronger.

[Frank\] You could consider making it a fight.]
(;W[pr]C[[Frank\] If you choose to play in this corner, why not 3-3?]
;B[qq];W[ek];B[dn]
(;W[fi]C[I think I shouldn't have ignored D6. I still could have put some pressure on the black group at C5.]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[cm]C[[Frank\] Far too easy for black.]
(;W[bj]C[I think I should have approached on the other side.

[Frank\] Not sure there's a huge difference right now.  You won't be able to kill either way.]
;B[bc]TR[dd][ed][df][ef][eg][fi][bj][ck][dk][ek]C[The white group is heavy and didn't accomplish much.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[bh];B[bi];W[ai];B[bg]C[Black is reduced, but it's not enough.]
;W[he]TR[ed][kd][ef][eg][fi][ek]C[I started trying to use white's influence on the center.

[Frank\] Too late.  The hard part is that you developed influence, but never got a chance to really use it.  The two normal ways to use influence is to attack or to build a huge moyo.  Neither happened in this game.

This is my last comment.];B[ke];W[id];B[jb];W[ic];B[ib];W[no]
C[Expanding white's bottom moyo.];B[nm];W[nj]TR[pj]C[I tried to move Q10, but I think this wasn't the right time. After O7 these stones are already behind enemy lines.]
;B[oj];W[om];B[ol];W[mm];B[ml];W[nn];B[nl];W[io]C[Expanding the moyo some more. Around here I even thought I could win the game :P]

;B[jn];W[jl]C[Isto foi um pouco mais ativo, mas ainda n√£o ajudava muito.]
;B[in];W[ko]C[I had to fall back to protect my territory. Or maybe I could try attacking J6 and solidifying myself in the process?]
;B[kn];W[lo];B[ho];W[ip];B[qr]C[I believe I'm some ~20 points behind here, it's already difficult to reverse the game.]
