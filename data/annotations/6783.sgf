RU[Japanese]

C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  This game was typical in that I fell behind fairly early, and had to try desperately to catch up, which only got me in more trouble.  One of the problems is that the moves I play look so reasonable, but somehow end up going so wrong.

This game also shows another typical problem for me, which is that when I try the same things that work for my opponents, they suddenly don't work.  My opponent was able to get a nice moyo, but when I did the same, it was attacked, leaving me with almost nothing.  When I attack, however, I'm the one who ends up with weak stones.

;B[pp]LB[qo:B][ro:A][rp:D][qr:C]C[pet:

A - D are more or less possible moves, see variations

A: good move, if b answers B, see variation;

B: ok, not perfect, but I'd played it also (without this analysis)  :-))

C: ok, common problem is, if w can't fight the ko (as allways in the beginning), this move is just ok, because w has to defend, see var.

D: possible, but B is better shape i think]
(;W[qo]C[Ted: I'm not certain about this move.  I didn't think either atari would be a good idea, however.  Should I have played S5 instead?

pet: Don't worry, I'm not certain too.];B[lp]LB[kp:A]C[perhaps for b better A instead M4]
;W[qk]C[Ted: I have a feeling this might have been a slow move.  I seem to recall a comment from another game I had reviewed in which the reviewer mentioned regarding a similar joseki that a move like R9 and a move in the corner are miai, but I can't tell that this position is quite the same.

It also looks to me that Black would get a lot of territory if I allowed him to play here and just take a few points in the corner instead.

pet: correct, it's slow, but if b moves somewhere around, it might be big for b then (this shows a bit greedy opinion), so better play elsewhere;
locally R9 is definitly to narrow, should be at least at R10, even R11 - R13 is to consider, as far as the w group is allready alive (R2 allways possible).]
;B[qi]LB[cc:B][dc:A][ed:C][qf:E][qg:D]C[Ted: As it is, Black gets an excellent position in the top right.
pet: R11 is a bit far, so as an answer i'd think about D or E.
Over all the corner (A,B,C) was a better idea, as D or E should be keept in reserve (smaller) for later. 

A: is the usual approach
B: if the ladder is for w, B is ok
C: special purpose (emphasise the top and looses some points in the corner)]

(;W[ed]C[Ted: I honestly don't know where I should have played.  This, P17, K17, and C10 all seem plausible to me, but I couldn't give any explanation on why one of them might be better than another.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[db]
(;W[eb]LB[ic:A]C[Ted: I get the feeling this isn't quite right, but I had no idea how to proceed to make certain this groups was going to get its two eyes, *and* make certain Black wasn't going to end up with a huge profit.

pet: this move is not sente, see var starts in two moves.
so it's too slow, the joseki says A instead];B[oc]
(;W[ic]C[Ted: I thought I was OK on the top here.];B[oi];W[cj]
C[Ted: This looked like the biggest part of the board still open.
pet: right, but w allready a bit behind, because b got p11;

1) r9 was slow and should have been at r11 
2) w was again too slow to punish b for the risky r11 afterwards

watch out for gote moves and avoid them, if possible!];B[dh]
;W[ej]C[pet: good idea];B[ip];W[gq]TR[oc][qd][oi][qi][cj][ej]
[dp]C[Ted: I didn't think my stones in the lower left were any worse than Black's group in the top right.  Apparently, I was wrong.

pet: g3 is well placed, there is still some balance in the game, b is ahead, but w is still in (as far as kyus playing)]
;B[gp]LB[fp:A][hq:B]C[pet:
A is normal 
in this case perhaps B is even better]
(;W[fq];B[hq]C[pet: now F4 is very big, and reverse sente (mean if b plays F4, w has to answer, so w F3 is a must)]
;W[lc];B[dn]C[Ted: I had absolutely no idea what to do next.  This move was completely unexpected to me, but even worse, I had no idea what *Black* was going to do on his next move.

How am I supposed to read far enough ahed to figure out how to get a good position when my opponent plays moves that are a surprise to me instead of what I read out?

pet: right you wonder about the difficult things here, F4 is still urgent and might be still the best move]
;W[cm]TR[cj][ej]C[Ted: I thought the stones above needed help to make certain they'll get their two eyes.  I don't see any way they'll connect to anything.

pet: with been behind, this is allmost like resign, for b now F4 is allready enough, without any danger]

(;B[co]C[Ted: I didn't expect this movie, either.  I figured Black would try to connect D6 to the group at the bottom.

pet: I wouldn't expect it too. :-))
with F4 b can easy win, this now leads to a fight; 
b should avoid unclear fights if ahead.];W[cp]C[pet: C4 ok, but now F4 is still missing]

(;B[bp]C[pet: gote, bad move];W[bq];B[bo];W[fn]C[Ted: This was obviously an attempt to make certain Black's gorup on the left couldn't connect to anything or get its two eyes.

pet: a very good move here; congratulations :-))];B[em];W[dl]
C[Ted: This was probably a mistake.  I think I should have played F4 here, but I was worried about Black playing the monkey jump at A8 and preventing this group from getting two eyes.

pet: you're right, still F4 would be nice, but now D8 is urgent]
;B[eo];W[fp]C[pet:  finally :-))];B[fo];W[go]
(;B[hp]C[pet: lucky you];W[gn];B[fl]C[Ted: Now I'm really in trouble.I have no clue how to save the stones at G6, and sacrificing them doesn't look like a viable option.  Just a few short moves ago, I thought I had a nice moyo, but obviously not now.]
;W[do];B[cn];W[en]C[Ted: At least I saved the group at G6, although this had consequences later on.]
;B[dm];W[cl];B[cq]C[pet: bad b move];W[dq];B[cr];W[br]C[pet: well done Ted :-))]
;B[fj];W[ei];B[hl];W[of]LB[rd:D][oe:C][og:B][qg:A]C[Ted: I had the distinct feeling that I was well behind.  What Black has on the bottom is just as much as what I've got on the top; what Black has in the top left is at least as much as I've got in the bottom right; and what Black has in the top right is well more than what I have in the bottom left and the few points in the left center.  I figured that if Black could attack me at D6, then surely I could attack Black too and have it work.

pet: again i'd to say you are right, w can do here something, 
P14 ecatly is not the move i'd play here.

I'd try A-D, preferring C or D, B i've read in a book is ok, but can explain really, A would be a bit of an overplay, but w is behind so ...]
;B[qf]C[pet: now the gam is over, b has more terretory ...]
;W[mf];B[mi];W[kf];B[ff]C[Ted: Something doesn't look quite right here.

pet: I'd try with D16 and then E14, G16 as you played was far too defensive, you've nothing too loose in this game]

(;W[gd];B[he]
(;W[hd]C[pet: what are you fearing?
see var with G15 instead!];B[ie]C[pet: the idea now should be to seperate b groups, not worry about some stones (in this caser high and light stones p14 eg.)
I would try F11, but it might be too tough]
(;W[nd]C[Ted: I had to try to figure out a way to make certain my stones in the P14 area were going to survive]
;B[nc];W[md];B[jd];W[jc];B[ge];W[eg]C[Ted: This was a desperate attempt to try to kill *something*.  I figured that killing the group to the right of F14 was impossible, but at least while making Black protect that, I could take the profit of killing the D12 stone.]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[fi];W[fh];B[dg];W[ef];B[df];W[fe];B[hh]C[Ted: It was here that I suddenly realized with horror that my group around C10 was split off from everything else.

The moral of the story is not to expect attacks that work for everybody else to work for you too, unless you can read far enough ahead to see that they'll work.  But again, how do you read ahead when your opponent consistently plays unexpected moves?]
;W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[bg];W[bi];B[di];W[dj]
(;B[bk]C[Ted: I didn't see this move coming at all.
pet: b B7 is the best move, and can't kill, but gets a seki]
;W[bm]C[Ted: I was guessing at how to save my group here  Doing more life and death problems might have helped more with this group, but there are still other problems elsewhere on the board.]
;B[ck];W[el];B[fm]
(;W[fk]C[pet: better F9 and get life];B[gk];W[ek];B[gj]
(;W[de];B[cf]C[Ted: I was hoping against hope that Black would miss this move.]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[ah];B[aj];W[hg];B[ig];W[gf];B[hf];W[gg];B[kh]

(;W[pq]C[pet: locally J12 is good, see vars];B[qr];W[pr];B[rr]
;W[rp];B[or]C[Ted: I tried a few more attacks, but none of them were going to work, so I resigned.  At the time, I figured my group on the left was dead, but I think it's actually "only" seki.  Not that it helps.  I'm still trailing very badly, and would be even if the group on the left were unconditionally alive.

pet: as far as i can see A8 brings your group to life, see var;
but still w is behind, but not that much, so r2 instead of q2 would help a bit, but then b a8 makes a real seki.

other important points for w are are:
J12 (sente)
N18 (endgame, but sente)
G2, H1, endgame, sente)
C18 (later, gote)

For the whole game I'd say:
For me analysing the game it's also a bit surprising how far w is behind now. 
Some hints for you might help:
1) Watch out for sente moves, if you feel a slow move near to a living group, think of something else.
2) Sometimes try a cut more than you do, especially if it can happen near your strength
3) You did not loose one stone, but your stones are separated into 4 groups (b has 2 groups-> means half the borderline), sometimes its better to connect or give away some stones  
4) In this game your opponent turned out to play quite strong for an 8kyu, i think

I hope i could help you a bit. In the end i'd say this game was interesting, but not easy to review (too many difficult vars).
Best wishes for the future
