AB[pd][dp]C[P: I dont know well how and when to attack. When I play with stronger players, usually I start an attack and in the end its me who is being attacked, or even dead.]

;W[po];B[qp];W[oq];B[ql];W[ok]LB[dn:A][ip:B]C[P: He has build a wall so I mave to make this wall not to make a base to make territory

HT: A simpler way is A. Play on the 4th line to help limit his moyo. He cannot build it too big in 1 move. A will also help you defend your corner, and can help prepar to invade or reduce the w moyo later. See variations for examples.]
(;B[jp]TR[jo][hq]C[P: If I play k3, I think will be more dificult to scape. Now I even think that k5 is better. I dont like h3 because this way he will end attackig d4

HT: This play seems like a fairly reasonable idea, however it seems a bit close to the p3 wall. Maybe you could try the two point high pincer? See variation.]
;W[hp]
(;B[lq]LB[jn:A][lp:B]C[P: I try to make a base, and I still have the opportunity to scape

HT: Shape-wise, this is not so great.  It's probably better to just jump out. m4 would be better than m3.]
;W[iq];B[lo];W[nn];B[mm]C[P: I attack the strong goup, but is no t a solid attack. Maybe L7?

HT: Yes, there is nothing to attack here. L7 is better.];W[mn]
;B[ln];W[lm];B[km];W[ll];B[kl];W[lk];B[kk];W[lj];B[dn]C[HT: good. This move is big. B is doing ok so far.]
;W[cl]LB[ci:A]TR[kk][kl][km]C[HT: You should pincer at A first, especially since you get to chase him toward the L8 wall.]
(;B[dr];W[cf];B[fd];W[di]LB[jc:C][bd:A][pf:D][hn:B]C[HT: You can attack the H4 group now. Also, C and D are bigger moves than A.]
(;B[bd];W[hc]LB[kc:B][lc:A]C[HT: 1 move closer at B is the correct pincer. A gives w room to make a base at K17.]
(;B[lc];W[fb]LB[db:C][ec:B][df:A]C[HT: Why A? Simply play B (or C) without A. A is aji keshi.]
(;B[df];W[cg];B[ec]LB[df:1][cg:2]SQ[ch]C[HT: Because of the 1-2 exchange b loses the chance to invade at c12 later.]

(;B[oe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf]LB[jc:C][qg:B][cm:A][hn:D]C[HT: B, C, and D are more important than the move at A.]
(;B[cm];W[dl];B[bm]TR[jc][hn]SQ[qg]C[HT: This is a yose move, but the game is not in yose yet. There are still two weak w groups. You should attack them instead on one of the triangle points or play the joseki point at r13.]
(;W[kc]C[P: Yes I know I should have attacked before, but Im ahead. In this situations I tend to make the biggest moves I can find and make sure that I will win. Maybe I should have reinforced my groups instead of have played b7

HT: Attacking is the biggest move.];B[ld];W[jn];B[in]C[HT: This is good.]

(;B[eq]TR[cq]C[HT: The only way this is a good move is if it kills w. Otherwise C3 is the proper move for b.]
;W[ep]LB[gr:A]C[HT: This w move is bad. It fixes b's weakness. w should just play at A without this move.]
;B[dq];W[gr]LB[ji:A][kj:B][es:C]C[HT: There is a proverb: "Don't run with keima." And as you saw you had to fix your cutting point immediately. See variation at B for something a little more active. Also note that W group is not alive yet. C is a good move. I would play the B moves first though because it's good not to get surrounded and the B move will attack H17 also, and because H17 is so weak, b should get to keep sente (see variation at B).]
(;B[ji];W[hi];B[kj];W[lh];B[hh];W[gh];B[ih];W[gg]LB[hd:B][he:D]
[ff:C][kg:A]C[HT: It looked like in your review you had considered the play on B. B is ok to strengthen F16, in particular because L6 is not so weak, it can live at any time on k2 if it needs to. However, the problem with B is it allows the w H17 group to become strong and H17 at the moment is very weak. Perhaps you could consider the play on D to surround the H17 group. Then w will be forced to choose between splitting F16 and H12 or living with H17 group. Remember, contact plays like B make the opponent stronger, although they are also useful for making yourself stronger if you're feeling in trouble.]

(;B[eb];W[fc]LB[jb:A][gd:C][hd:B]C[HT: The move at A is careless. Must take care of your own groups also. B is better. C is the shape point.]
(;B[jb];W[gd];B[fe];W[ge]LB[kh:A][es:B]C[HT: A is not so important. B is big, play it instead.]
(;B[kh];W[cd]LB[cb:A][bc:B]C[HT: You can live bigger on B.]
(;B[cb];W[bb]LB[bc:B][dc:A]C[HT: Still not too late to play on B.]

Also keep in mind that the E17 group has E18 if it needs it. W should not be able to cut F16 from H12 in sente, so b can play E18 whenever it is necessary.]
