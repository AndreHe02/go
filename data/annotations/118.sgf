US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[0.5];B[dp];W[pq];B[dc];W[pd];B[po];W[np]C[Shadow: Following a  Joseki I don't know well.]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[pr]C[Shadow: This is not joseki and  a mistake by black, but not sure how to take best advantage of it.

jc> The normal move for black is to link his stones by playing R4.Since black  has neglected this move by favoring the corner with Q2, white should place  high (not absolute) value on keeping the R3 group separated from Q5.]
;W[qp];B[rq]L[or][pp]C[jc> white Q4 makes nice shape with O4 and would make  Q5 weak.]

(;W[or];B[pp]C[jc> white lets black take the good point of Q4.];W[oq];B
[rr];W[ps];B[ql]C[Shadow: White got a good trade out of this and r4 still has  aji for later.

jc> The trade wasn't good.
 is overconcentrated on the bottom while black has nearly ideal shape on the  bottom right (black is not worried about white R4).]

(;W[qi]C[Shadow: Don't  think this was the best move possible. Others I considered were d15, f3, d6,  d10, k16.

F3 looks best to me in hindsight.  It works well with p3 stones. and a pincer  by b is not a good idea.  But I shied away from f3 becus if w did pincer it I  wouldn't know how to respond properly.
  jc> R11 is ok.];B[nc];W[lc]C[Shadow: Pincering seemed best here cause I had  a stone at r13 already.  If b took the corner I could make a big wall.]
;B[qc]L[pc][qd]C[jc> White blocks the wrong way in the game (Q17).  White  should block at R16 since R11 won't be too close to the resulting wall.   (block on the side where you have the larger extension).]

(;W[pc];B[qd]L[qe][pe]C[Shadow:  Black didn't do what I expected.  So I tried to block hoping the weakness of  his stones would soon be revealed to me.

jc> since white has decided to block at Q17 he should play the joseki move of  Q15.]

(;W[qe]L[qf][qb]C[jc> the position in the top right was recently  discussed in rec.games.go.  The consensus is that white R15 is an over play  and that black can exploit it by playing R18.]

(;B[qf];W[re];B[pb];W[ob];B[pe];W[qb]C[jc> R15 was a mistake but, given that it's done, R18 is a  good follow up.]
;B[rf]C[jc> blacks play is not bad here.  although he gives  white a big corner by sacrificing his 3 corner stones he builds a wall on the  right that works well with R8.]
;W[rc];B[pi];W[pf]C[Shadow: This doesn't feel good,  but I don't know what else to do.

jc> things are kinda ugly, Q14 is as good a move as any.];B[pg];W[oe];B
[pj];W[og];B[ph]C[Shadow the wall I get and the corner are good exchange for r11  stone. Right?

jc> white has taken about 20 pts in the corner with potential for more on the  upper side.  Meanwhile black has about 30 pts of secure territory on the  right.  The exchange favored black: R11 is useless while O17 still has aji  and M17 is too close to whites wall.]
;W[cj]C[jc> playing on the upper side  around G17 or G16 might be good.  D17 can't be "attacked" as it is not yet  weak.  white could approach it though.

Shadow again same choice of other moves are available.  I'm letting my  strength of p3 and p18 stones probably go to wast now though.]
;B[ch];W[cn]C[jc> black is stronger here so C6 is a large extension ...]
;B[cl]L[bl][fq]C[jc>  as a result white might want to treat the C10 stone lightly and play a double  kakari at F3]

(;W[bl]C[Shadow: sacrafice b8 to get a wall on the outside.];B[bk];W[ck]
;B[bm];W[dl];B[cm];W[dm];B[bn]L[co][bj]C[jc> if white wants  an outside wall then he should play the forcing move of B10 now.]

(;W[co];B[cp]C[jc> white should play B10!]
(;W[bo];B[bj];W[bi]C[Shadow: this doesn't  look like a good wall to me!]
;B[ci];W[dk];B[dn];W[al];B[bh];W[an];B[ld]C[Shadow: he is attacking me where I am strong.  how should I have handled  this?

jc> I would hane at L16 hoping to build a wall to use against the upper left.   M16 was a good move by black to exploit whites overconcentrated stones.]

(;W[md];B[mc];W[kc];B[nd];W[me];B[ne];W[nf];B[hc]C[Shadow: This was bad for white.   I should have had alot more of the top than this!]
;W[kf]C[Shadow: I was  trying to capture m16 and gain influence to capture a big middle now that the  top was ruined.

jc> because of blacks Q10 wall and strong upper left, white has no chance of  getting a big house in the middle.]
;B[jj]C[jc> black should play on the  bottom which is still wide open.

for white I favor a move around J4.  No need to approach the bottom left  corner too closely since it is open to white on the left.]
;W[fq]C[Shadow: This  feels like a good extension.];B[jp]C[Shadow: Jumped right into the middle of  it.  Reducing move.]
;W[jq];B[hq];W[iq];B[hp]C[Shadow: j3 was a mistake. Black  gets a wall seperating my two whit e groups.  Neither are weak but this  shouldn't have happend.  Black reduced Whites territory much too easily.]

;W[ep];B[fm];W[eo];B[fn]C[Shadow: Black looks in bad shape, but I never figure out how  to take advantage of it.  Black is just to big to handle.

jc> blacks shape is kinda heavy but with the K10 stone it's not so bad.  The  H2 wall is working well.]
;W[er];B[jn];W[io]C[jc> J5 just strengthens  black.  Now white has no chance to peep here.  White should play at L4  immediately.]
;B[in];W[kp];B[nn]C[Shadow: Black has a moyo in top left developing  that I've ignored and building towards a center territory as well.  I'm  feeling behind, how did this happen.  I had a good opening and wasted it!

jc> lets estimate the score (variation B).]
(;W[qo]C[Shadow: A stupid move  I'm not sure what I was trying to do.];B
[qn];W[pn];B[on];W[rn];B[qm];W[ro];B[rm]C[Shadow: I made black strong, and finaly realize the error of my  thinking.]
;W[de]C[Shadow: Reduce Blacks moyo.  Probably too deep.];B[ce];W[dd];B[cd]
;W[ec];B[cc]L[fe][eb]C[Shadow: Joseki has me play d13, but that  doesn't seem right with c12 stones there.  I'd like to go e18, but then black  curls around at d14.

jc> white should play e18.]
(;W[fe]C[Shadow this is what I thought was best.  not realising how important e18 was!]
;B[gj]C[Shadow: I should have gone e18  now!  But I got distracted thinking Oh black want the center. He can have it  if he'll let me have the top!  Gimme Gimme (stupid)

jc> good idea, but poor execution.];W[gh]C[jc> white needs to play E18  instead of G12]
;B[mi];W[lh]C[jc> K12 is a better play in the middle but white  still needs to play E18.]
;B[li]C[Shadow: During the game I felt I had claimed  a lot of territory and decided to reduce Blacks center.  I forgot about e18]
;W[ln];B[lo];W[ko];B[kn];W[mo]C[Shadow: I'm not doing well in reducing  anything.

jc> white got a reasonable result here.];B[lm];W[mn];B[mm];W[jh]C[Shadow: I  felt black could get into the top because it was so loose.

jc> M12 would have been better spent here at K12.  E18 is still looming]
;B[ii];W[ih];B[eb]C[Shadow: Black shows me the error in my thinking. :(

How can I minimize the damage?]
(;W[fc];B[fb];W[gb]C[Shadow: I wasn't willing  to admit just how good a move e18 was, and started throwing away stones.

;W[hb];B[ib];W[db];B[ga];W[cb];B[bb];W[ba];B[da];W[bc];B[ca];W[he]C[Shadow: I  finaly realiz just how bad the situation is.  So I back off so I don't loose  everything.  Hopefully I can return the damage to his center.]
;B[gd];W[ge];B[jd];W[kd];B[je];W[jb];B[jc];W[kb];B[ke];W[le];B[if];W[jl]
C[Shadow:  Getting desperate.  This is a weak point in his structure and hopefully I can  run away and hurt him as bad as he hurt me.

jc> K8 is a hopeless move.  The game is over.

closing comments: white needs to be more patient.  take care of your groups.   when your opponent makes a mistake play *carefully* (not recklessly over  aggressive) and try to accumulate small advantages.    keep studying and Good luck!  The most important to remember when playing Go  is to have *fun*.  When winning is not so important you will find it easier  be patient and as a result you will do better.

--jfc];B[ki]C[jc> black L11 is too slack.  black should play E11.];W[ji]
C[Shadow I  considered g9 to link j8 out.  Why I chose k11 I can't remember.]
;B[ij];W[hl]C[Shadow: If I was trying to reduce, I should have played much lighter.]
;B[fk]C[Shadow: this should me I should have played looser.];W[fl]C[Shadow:  Desperate, hopefully I can shack something loose.]
;B[gl];W[el];B[hg]C[Shadow:  I had to ignore this.  If I was going to win, I needed to capture something.

jc> black is winning so he should play the linking move of E11.  This would  make the game an easy win]
