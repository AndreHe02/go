C[I want to thank you for taking the time to review this game.

I played black and even though I won comfortably, this was mostly due to the negative komi of -5.5.

Any comment on the opening and the middle game is appreciated.

****************
I will do my best, though the opening is a weakness of mine.]

I agree. However I think this pincer is a little tight. White is rock solid on the left. Generally when you pincer, if your opponent is strong on that side, you should pincer loosely.]

Problem here is that this is too high. This is a little risky as white can get underneath. However I tried a few variations, and black's wall is strong. It is probably a good move.]

I don't see anything wrong with this move other than it contacts a weak stone. However white has so little in the way of framework in the center, even this slight strengthing is not problematic. White cannot afford to be making these slight reductions.]

You have typed done.
koukichi: 72.5 to jnhmsbn: 87.0

if you replace -5.5 by regular komi 6.5 the result is quite close.
Of course I lost a lot of points because of the k11 stones.

************************

I think you played a good game. However I think your H7 group was lucky to escape - that was where you really almost lost. I think your invasion at the bottom should not have given you that attack on the group to the left which made it profitable. The H3 attack was devastating, and White had a chance to fix that. The K19 group probably should not have survived.

You seem to like to make big moves rather than take care of groups. This is always a fine line, but I think, at least in this game, you probably needed to take care of your weak groups a little better. A stronger player would have killed them. So try to help your weak groups a little more.

Good luck!
