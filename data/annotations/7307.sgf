C[Hi,

I m a 15k IGS playing Black on this game.

I only won this game by a mistake of my opponent at the end.
I m especially interested for a review of the opening part of the game.

I put some comments at , 79, 19, 27, 39, 41, 43, 49, 53, 58, 71, 79, 89, 107, 130, 131, 175, 184 and 268.

Thx for reviewing my game.

Sirkut> Hello. Thanks for submitting your game for review.  I'll preceed all my comments with 'Sirkut>'.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq];W[co];B[jq]C[I hesitated between K3 and R10...
R10 is better to develop my lower right corner but K3 also counter white's corner development so I chose K3.

Sirkut> I think you've hit upon on of the big questions. ;)  Personally I like K17 - it could push W toward the strength of T1, or serve as a backup for a corner approach or pincer against A19.]

;W[op];B[pp];W[oo];B[om]LB[qn:A][nq:B]TR[jc][dj]SQ[np]C[Not sure about this...
Trying to increase pressure on the 4 white stone. They are not alive yet so I was hoping to gain profit from that...

Sirkut> Good thought, but you are pushing from a weak position - a stone that needs to think more about life itself than attacking. Unless you are quite good with life-and-death, I would be worrying more about keeping your stones connected before thinking about killing.  

I've marked the two positions I like better for this local situation. 'A' would make all your stones in that corner strong from where you could then continue your attack safely. 'B' would strengthen and expand your corner while also putting pressure on W. W would probably choose to respond with O4 - then you could play 'A', getting the best of both worlds. There's a chance that with the delay White would be able to escape or gain life - but that's a risk anyway. Remember your goal is to get more territory than your opponent, not to kill your opponent - so with every move think about gaining mojo or strengthening mojo.

At this point it's hard to not feel like the focus here is too small though. You'd probably be better off playing K17 or D10 and be willing to give up R8 if white decides it's important enought to attack now.]

(;B[fc]C[I was thinking I could take the corner or extend depending on the response...

Sirkut> Yes, but you are asking for a fight. Black shouldn't ask for a fight. ;)
The problem is that since you have no backup, white will probably not feel very threatened and pincer you. Then your options are 1. - you _have_ to win the corner and have a vicious fight to do it, or 2. - you run strait out, gaining no territory as you run but strengthening white as he chases.
Look at the variation on this move.];W[hc];B[kc]C[My F17 stone does not seem in great danger, I chose to pincer H17...
Is K17 better ?

Sirkut> To me it looks like F17 will have to run fast while L17 will have to make a base for life - and they'll have to do them at the same time.]
;W[mc]C[Sirkut> But maybe white will get carried away and weak..]
;B[ob]C[Defending the corner, I m not sure this is the best way to do it...

Sirkut> Fair enough. Q17 would be simpler, but get you the same points - just in a different order.]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[od];B[oe];W[nb];B[oa]C[I hesitated with N16 but didnt managed to read it so I chose something safer...

;W[na];B[qb];W[md];B[ke]C[L 16 may be better ?

Sirkut> No, you need to get out of there asap - your backup is weak.]

Sirkut> Poor white! ;)
Thanks a lot for submitting this game. It was interested and you two seemed fairly well matched. However I think we some focus on a few key points your game will improve quite a bit.

- Before playing each stone, look for the biggest move. If you find yourself playing more than two connecting stones in a row in the first third of the game, look for ways to play in other areas of the board.

- When playing black especially, don't think about killing or attacking - think about gaining territory and strengthening your shapes.

- Try to focus on strategy instead of tactics - In tactics it's easy to make mistakes, but a good strategy will tolerate some mistakes. So think less about what the best place is for a certain stone, and more about the direction shapes are facing and how fast they can move.

I hope you find this review and these tips helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
Have fun!])
