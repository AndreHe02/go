AB[pd][dp]C[Hi I'm Novbert, 15 kyu at the moment on KGS.
This was a game I've played as black against a 13 kyu player.

Though I won I still can't tell if it was my instinctually good moves or my opponent's bad ones. Actually I thought I lost this game till the result window appeared. Having more than 20 prisoners and none of the corners I was more than surprised when I realized that I won with 18 points.

What I expect from this review is getting some feedback on my overall line of play and strategic decisions. And some explanation why I won :)



Hi!  I'm paps (1k on Kgs) I'll try to review your game the best I can. If you have any question let me a message on KGS]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[ec];B[jc]LB[ic:a]C[This was going to be a pincer here - I'm not sure how I missed white's opportunity to make a two-space extension. J17 would probably be better.

paps: K17 is ok as it  expands Q16 potential. If you want ot attack E17 play a closer pincer (G17 or G16)]
;W[hc]
(;B[dg];W[cc];B[gd];W[gc];B[cb]C[paps : Strange move; B17 seems more common to establish a base for you C16 D13 stones. But if your opponent lets you confine him in the corner it's good for you!!!]
;W[bc];B[dc]
(;W[db];B[dd];W[bb];B[eb];W[ca];B[fc];W[fb];B[ed]C[I'm trying to break white's shape here providing him less space in the corner, while building outside moyo. I've actually done that a lot in this game. Letting white live on the third line didn't seem to be the best idea.]
;W[ea];B[ec]
(;W[gb];B[hd];W[ic];B[id];W[cn];B[cl]MA[dg]C[The idea behind this pincer was to make the above area harder to penetrate. I think this stone with the marked one and the thickness above has nice potential

Paps: yes good extension and pincer is a good move (always try to kill two birds with one stone:))]
;W[bq]C[...even if part of the corner had to be sacrificed during the process]
;B[bp]C[Paps: good idea. as B3 is an overplay trying to separate or force white in a low position is your goal.]
;W[bo]
(;B[co];W[ap];B[do];W[cp];B[cq]
(;W[bp]LB[do:A]C[Same idea here as in the upper left corner: pushing white below the third line and making him close eyes.

Paps : W shouldn't connect here if you take and connect: A stone becomes a wasted stone]
;B[cr];W[dn];B[fo];W[fn];B[nq]C[maybe an early move, but the lower left group is relatively stable now, so I tried to play away from that relative thickness.

Paps: good Idea 
Attacking bottom left W group would also be an option to get some benefit. If he hanes you at G 5 he could become stronger and avoid future problems!]
(;W[lq];B[no]LB[nr:a]C[...and now push white toward that thickness. Of course he could still connect at 'A']
(;W[pn];B[iq];W[lo];B[qq]C[Same idea here as in the other two corners - not letting white to get the whole territory.]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[or]
(;B[qs]C[paps this connection is wrong  (see variation for the most usual joseki options) 
Connecting like this you cannot come out with keima it lets a cut]
;W[oq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[oo]LB[nn:a]MA[no][nq]C[I wanted to give a chance for the marked stones to escape with this peep. Without it they'd most likely die if white plays on 'A'

paps: M3 and M5 are rather weak so I don't think W can close B in]
(;W[po];B[rr]C[I'm still wondering if it was the good move - but none of the alternatives seem to work. Is the group already dead?]
;W[rp]
(;B[sq]LB[rq:a]C[A move at 'A' would be better

Paps a is better  because B is alive in sente (if W takes!!! not that sure it's small at this stage). With T3 black can survive gote (look at the variations)]
;W[so]
(;B[nm];W[nr];B[bm];W[bn];B[en];W[em];B[eo];W[dm];B[gn]C[paps: a rule to remember: " if you can atari from both sides (G6 and  F7 here ) don't play atari " unless you have very good reasons (forcing your opponent in a bad shape, save your stones..) let the choice for later perhaps the cut will become more interresting in a few move...]
;W[fm];B[dj];W[rq]MA[qp][qq][sq][pr][rr][qs]C[now the marked group is dead. I'm really not sure if the moves before it were worth this sacfifice. White's move is worth about 16 points as I see - sounds like a lot - even if gote.

Paps adding a move to survive probably bigger than B7 :)];B[qg]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qb]LB[qe:a]MA[qg]C[In earlier games I've always played 'A' for a 3-3 invasion but that would give just too large corner territory to W. The marked black stone helps a lot for this move to be successful]
;W[rb];B[pb];W[qf];B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[pe];B[oe]C[paps dangerous KO but in this position you're to ply like this!]
;W[qe];B[og];W[rg];B[qh]C[And now White starts his way on the second line pushing black from back. I didn't feel like interrrupting as both of his groups seemed to be alive and while he lives on the second line and gains about five points of territory, I can build a solid moyo on the third.

paps : of course W should take sente now!];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri]
;B[qj];W[rk];B[qk];W[rl]
(;B[qm]LB[ok:c][ol:b][pl:a]MA[pn][rn][qo]C[I tried to break the shape of the marked white stones here - maybe an overplay, but both 'A', 'B', and 'C' leaves some aji behind for white (see alternatives)


paps: you can connect with any option (see variations)];W[ql]

;B[ph]MA[qm]C[Eventually the marked stone made me able to catch white in a net.

Paps I don't see a net but for sure W schould take sente ( later he can play as in the variation)]
(;W[rm];B[in];W[ej];B[ek];W[fk];B[fj]LB[dk:a]C[playing A instead would probably also work.]
;W[ei];B[di];W[dk];B[dl];W[el];B[ck];W[ek];B[gl]C[Paps  avoid thi s kind of move too clos to your opponent's wall always try to attack from far!(this group seems impossible to kill but you can gain some benefits by attacking]
;W[gk];B[il];W[hk];B[gi]MA[hk]C[This supposed to be an eye-stealing tesuji. Considering the marked white stone now it looks like a really bad idea.


paps same idea too close to his wall];W[hi];B[hh];W[fi];B[hj]
;W[gj];B[ii];W[ij]
(;B[hi]LB[an:b][br:a]C['A' and 'B' are miai now, so white's next move at 'A' is really pointless

[lq]C[I'm really not sure what white is doing here. Penetrate the center territory based on the marked stones with moves like 'A' or 'B' would make more sense then connecting living groups.]

Paps invade not but reduce by comming out sure.


you played far much better than your opponnent in this game. 

1: try to pay attention to your shape (moves 22 34 52 150 ) 
2 avoid to play unnecessary atari 
3 don't save a single stone close to your opponent wall 

and I'm sure you will rapidly get even stranger!!!
