C[Hi my name is Andrew. In this game my opponent is Many Faces of Go 12 kyu. I play against this program because I do not normally have enought time to play against an actual person on a server. I have gradually gotten better over the past 3 months. I used to not be able to beat the 18 kyu bot, and now I can beat the 12 kyu every once in a while. This is one of those games. Any and all commentary will be greatly appreciated. I will have comments/questions throughout the game.

---

Hello Andrew,

My name is Martin. I play on KGS as Hludowicus (4k). I'm happy to do the review. I hope it will be useful.

I will focus on the early stage of the game. I feel this where you can develop fast, with a bit of teaching, whereas progress in the middle game depends a lot on reading ability and fighting spirit, which will progress as you play.

I think you have good potential. I like the way you do not get in love with your stones: you're always ready to abandon them when you've seen the situation is hopeless. This is uncommon among double-digit kyu players. And you look for fights without being reckless about it, and that is another important asset.

Since reviews can be difficult to digest, I've chosen five of your stones that point toward something you could ameliorate fast and easy: 7 - 15 - 27 - 31 - 43. Check those up.

Enjoy :)
Martin];B[pe]C[I normally play on the star point, but wanted to try something new.

---

Fine. One should try new things. Good way to learn.

Consider that this 5-4 opening stone is best used to develop outside influence toward the center and the lower right.]
;W[dq];B[dd]C[It would have been more coherent to play in the lower right corner, since your 5-4 stone is oriented in that direction.]
;W[pp];B[pc]TR[jc][je]SQ[qd]C[Is this the proper move to secure the corner after playing the 5-4 spot?


---

It's excellent, but it has both strengths and limits. It's great to develop toward the upper left, with the possible triangled plays shown.

However, it's not a surefire way to protect the corner. If White invades at R16, he might live, either by ko, or because you let him to build your outside influence.]
;W[fc]
(;B[ec]TR[jc][je]C[EASY CORRECTION 1

In context, this is a mistake. This is only good if White is already cramped toward the right. Imagine you had stones on the triangles: White would not be comfortable.

A pincer would have been better: it would work nicely with your upper right stronghold, and pressure White at the same time.]
;W[fd];B[df]C[This joseki settles the group of stones correct?

---

This joseki is good for fighting. The D14 stone keeps the pressure on the two white stones. But this does not protect the corner efficiently. White can invade and live inside later (see variation).

The spirit of the 4-4 stone in the corner is versatility and fighting, not territory. If you like to build territory fast in the corner, you should favor 3-4 corner plays.]

(;W[jd]TR[pc][pe]C[White is limiting the potential of your upper right influence: this is something you've envouraged him to do by starting the wrong joseki in the upper left.]
;B[nq];W[kq]
(;B[pq]C[Was this the right response?

---

Good play, wrong context. It's a joseki move, all right, but its purpose is mostly to secure life or flight when you are under pressure. Here, you had enough space to try something more, such as the extension toward the centre, or the 3-3 invasion (see joseki...)]
;W[op];B[np]TR[oq]C[EASY CORRECTION 2

Quite often, a simple connection is much better. If a human was playing, he would cut immediately, and the fight would not favor black.

I like playing computers, but they have a skewed sense of priority: they will let you survive many mistakes...

In short: connecting is rarely wrong, not connecting is often very bad! Simple enough :)]
;W[co];B[iq]TR[oq]MA[pj]C[Looking back, I'm unsure why I played here instead of somewhere like X. I think this is an over-play on my part.

---

I have no problem with this J3 really, except I still think connecting is more urgent.]
;W[ko];B[qi]TR[io][fq][oq]C[Not bad, but you should think about defending before building. Here connecting in the lower right or supporting the lone stone in the bottom was more important]
;W[nc];B[oc]TR[lc][ne][cj]C[This stone does not do much. Even without considering the important defensive plays, there are bigger plays to be made, such as C10.

If you want to disturb White's development in the upper side, you can go as far as invading with M17, or capping with O15.]
;W[nd];B[od]TR[nf]C[Is this move necessary?

---

Not at all! Your last two plays had very low efficiency: they do not pressure white, they do not promise future help for black. In that area, O14 would have been better.

Do not play stones that have no clear purpose.];W[ne];B[cj]
;W[on];B[oo]C[EASY CORRECTION 3

Obvious mistake, which White punishes immediately.

I'm mentioning it because a few of your mistakes could have been averted easily. One should resist the temptation of playing before considering the adversary's potential responses. Quite often, reading 3 moves ahead is enough; one does not need deep reading abilities. Here, you could certainly that this was useless.]
;W[no];B[po];W[qo];B[gq]TR[fq]C[Remembering some guidelines I was taught, I decided to strengthen a weak group of stones.

---

EASY CORRECTION 4

Fine, but when you stretch like this on the third line, do not hesitate to go one space farther. It's standard form: the stones cannot be cut apart easily and your escape is more difficult to prevent if you have a larger base.]
;W[qq];B[oq];W[pn];B[lr];W[kr];B[lq];W[qr];B[pr];W[lp];B[mp]
;W[mo];B[ho]TR[gq][iq]MA[hp]C[I see this formation played a lot in professional games. I am unsure why, the only reason I can think of is that it is a strong structure. What would happen if white were to play at X? Would this make my stones weak?


---

It's a classic shape, very strong. You should figure out what happens if White plays inside it: you'll remember the result much better than if I give you the details.

EASY CORRECTION 5

However, this is a major mistake because your lower right group is in danger of dying (variation).]

(;W[cl];B[ck];W[dl];B[dk]CR[cj][ck]C[This kind of empty triangle is something you should try to avoid. It's innefficient.

Playing move #45 at E10 would have worked better.];W[ek];B[en]
C[This move was intended to both attack and build up my territory.

---

Not very efficient for building territory, because there are white stones all around. For territory, R8 would have been better: you augment your space while reducing White's.

Moreover, you are letting your weak empty triangle under pressure.]
;W[ej];B[di]TR[dh]C[Was this a good response?


---

It's ok, but D12 is better.];W[hk];B[hd]C[Again looking back I feel this is an overplay on my part.

---

Not so much: you have the necessary leeway to escape.];W[ff]
C[... but this gives White the chance to build a wall which will menace your left side and limit your upper left development.]
;B[fg]C[Ok, but this makes your last play incoherent.

This is another spot where you could figure out what would happen. Playing F14 directly instead of H16 would have been better.]
;W[gf];B[gg];W[hf];B[hg];W[if];B[ig]TR[el]C[This pushing sequence was meant to divide whites two groups.

---

This is the right idea. Once you've started the wall, you can continue building it if it's oriented in a useful way. Here, it can serve as support to attack with the cut at E8]

[mj][nj][oj][lk][mk][nk][ok][ll][ml][nl][ol]SQ[pj]C[Not necessary, not big enough at this point.

You do not want White to make too much territory in the centre, so maybe Q10 would have been more efficient.]
;W[il];B[jl]C[This should have been played at K6.];W[jn];B[kn]
C[You already have all the tools you need to prevent this kind of mistake: read three moves ahead.]
;W[jo]TR[jl][jm][km][kn]C[I notice my marked stones are dead. So I decide to play elsewhere.

---

That's the correct idea. Those dead stones can be put to use later.]
;B[pi]C[Good move];W[rk];B[pk];W[pl];B[nj]TR[pi][pk]C[Using the same formation from earlier.]
;W[lg];B[jf];W[lm]C[Unsure why white played here. I feel it was a move wasted on there part, and that they shouldn't have played tenuki.

---

True. White could still win, but not responding to K14 makes thing difficult for it.]
;B[kk]C[Good play: you give purpose to your dead stones.];W[ln]
;B[lj];W[ld]C[Another bad move from White.];B[je];W[ke]C[Another mistake by White.]

I'm positive White could kill. It did not have to connect at R1, so you lived.]
;W[qs]C[Mistake by white.];B[mr]C[That is the play.];W[ls];B[nr]
;W[sk]
(;B[ms]C[instead of 2 eyes i got 3.

---

Too small a gain (1 stone = 1 point). There are much bigger plays on the board, such as D2. Compare the two variations, where one begins with White playing E2, the other with Black playing D2. You will see that D2 is worth about 4 points.

K2 and B9 are also bigger. In the endgame, side plays of that kind are often the most interesting.]

You defended well against White's all and out effort at killing your groups on the lower side and in the upper corner.

You did not make major blunders, but certain of your moves where unefficient.

I would advise you to:

• Play against humans when you can. Computers play differently and limiting your experience to their style will not prepare you to play humans.
• Always think a few seconds before playing a stone. Blitz play can be fun, but it does not make one a better player, so...
• Try to find time to play a longer game once in a while. Even one long game per week would be very useful.]
