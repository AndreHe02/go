C[Hello, Im octan8 playing white
I have Sdokis mail somwhere so please review for both sides although there will be questions only from me.

I have real troubles seeing whos ahead in a game so please comment on whos currently ahead

-----

z: Game reviewed by "zenjutsu" (4k* on IGS).  Comments preceeded by "z:".

z: Quick correction to octan8's commentary above: octan8 plays B.

z: I will strive to give the best guidance I am able to give. As an amateur, I feel obliged to remind you that my comments are merely opinions, and for facts you would want to appeal to a higher Go authority than me.  I will give comments throughout the game, and a summary at the end of the game.

z: My first major comment: generally the best games to submit are those which you lose and you are not certain how you lost. If you won, then clearly something went right for you.  I realize that there is still plenty to learn from reviewing a won game, but I state again that the best are the games which you lose and do not fully understand how you could have won.]
;B[pp]C[z: Right now, B is ahead.

z: ...sorry, I couldn't resist the easy joke.  :)

z: Seriously, I will try to insert some gut-feelings about who is ahead at different key points in the game.  However, I must admit that my score estimating skills are sub-par; it is a skill-set which I am just beginning to work on.]
;W[pd];B[cp];W[cc];B[eq];W[kq]C[z: I am not certain this is the most interesting place to play. It certainly leaves a very juicy play for B around D10, however with W's 3-3 in the corner, perhaps D10 is less interesting to B?  Personally, my instincts tell me W should prevent B's natural extension from the shimari by placing this stone around C9 or 10.  I could be wrong.]
;B[nq]C[z: Here, I think B should have taken the extension from the shimari. Again, just my opinion.]
;W[hq];B[cj]C[z: Good.];W[ch];B[qf];W[nd];B[qi];W[jc];B[dd]
C[octan8: wanted to reduce the most open part of his framework but didnt think well of C14 since that might hurt my C10 stone too much. This turned out really ugly and would like some suggestions on a better move

z: This play by B seems quite good to me.  ...and you are correct, playing C14 could severely damage your C10 stone.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[be];B[ec];W[gd]C[z: In the immediate locality, I think I prefer this stone at G17.  Here, it threatens to capture B, but B can easily escape... and G16 fails to create any territory while making the threat. G17 gains territory, and still forces B to run to center.

z: In a more broad local way of thinking, I prefer D14.  Playing D14 secures W's corner, prevents B from running to left side group, and begins making a framework for a very nice C7-ish play. I could be wrong.]
;B[eg];W[di]C[z: Important to keep opponent stones seperated if neither is yet alive.  Good habit to practice.]
;B[dj];W[ei];B[ge];W[ff]C[z: This stone feels too ambitious.  W is stating "I already know that I can kill your group".  Honestly, I don't think W can. The more prudent play is one that builds territory for W.  This play is a real gift to B.]
;B[fd];W[ef]
(;B[gc]C[z: I prefer H16 (alternate move tree).];W[hd];B[hc]
;W[he];B[fb]C[z: Too premature for this eye-making play.];W[fg]
;B[db];W[qp]C[octan8: never seen this move before so really had no idea about what to do

z: This type of approach is a way to pick a fight.  Note that ignoring B's last stone leaves a large weakness at C16.]

(;B[qq]C[z: I like B's response so far.  The alternative move tree exists purely to demonstrate the weakness at C16.]
;W[rq];B[rp];W[qo];B[rr];W[pq];B[sq];W[op];B[pr];W[oq];B[or]
;W[qk]C[z: Mistake!]
(;B[pj]C[z: Nope.  The ladder is now broken, and you had a real chance to punish W for his greedy R9 stone.  See alternative move tree.]
;W[ol];B[ej];W[fm]C[octan8; think I hanldled this reduction pretty bad but dont know what to do instead

z: B's easiest response is a very calm D7.  W's ability to make territory in the center is non-existent, as B can sneak into center at F10, G5, N4, and anywhere on the right.

z: At this point, I'd like to make a quick overall assessment of the board.  Right now, I feel B is significantly ahead because his territory is solid, and W has many weaknesses.  B's territory is currently only weak around D7.  W is weak at many points, such as M17, R17, Q5, and C16.]

(;B[gp]C[z: I don't like this move at all.  If B had D7, then I think the game is essentially over for W.]
;W[dm];B[hm]C[z: This play is bad.  The key is to threaten to capture without having a true intent of making the capture.  Yet make a threat in a manner that strengthens you (territory, giving life to a near-dead group of your own, or muscle to capture a different group) more than it strengthens the opponent.]
;W[gn]C[z: Good response by W.];B[hn]
(;W[gl]C[z: ?  Bad.  W should continue to seperate B by playing G5.  The alternative move trees are not fully thought out, but they illustrate the pain B feels if W plays G5.]
;B[gj];W[hl];B[ij];W[ik];B[jj];W[kl];B[hp];W[ip];B[io]
(;W[im]C[z: If white feels it necessary to strengthen the connection of the left group, then he should try to do it in sente, such as at H9.]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[hr];W[re]C[z: Big play.  However I wonder if the timing is right.  B's D10 group is VERY weak right now.  If that group is strengthened, then W's bottom will become very weak.  Furthermore, B would be very close to fully enclosing the bottom 1/2 of the screen without W having any eyes.  Very dangerous to leave such a large area so unstable.]

(;B[rf]SQ[sj][rj][qj][pj][oj][nj][mj][lj][kj][jj][ij][hj][gj]
[fj][ej][dj][cj][bj][aj]C[z: I don't like this play.  Look at the entire screen below the 10th line (marked).  B's two corners are very alive.  The other thing to look at is the condition of the B stones on the 10th line.  I think the timing is either at hand or very close to needing to place another stone to strengthen them.  If you strengthen that line, then W has to respond, or risk losing an enormous area.]

(;W[qe];B[of];W[pe];B[np]C[z: Somebody finally looked at the situation in this area, but I think you picked the wrong stone to extend.]
;W[oo];B[jo];W[ko];B[kn];W[lo];B[no];W[ln];B[on];W[po];B[ic]
C[z: I really don't like this play either.  You are forcing W to build a stronger wall on the top, which will enable W to more easily capture your line #10 stones.]

(;W[je]C[z: Bad shape.  I prefer the simplicity of K16 for building the wall to attack the B stones on line #10.]
;B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[lb];B[lc];W[mb];B[ld];W[ke];B[me];W[ne]
;B[nf]C[z: Oops.  Too easy to cut.  Although I'm not certain that B wants another weak group on the board right now anyway, so just giving up these stones in order to help protect the line #10 stones might be best.  Anyway, without considering line #10, locally N14 was the play to escape out of the noose.  But then there would be significant damage to B's already small right, and still no insurance that either the new weak group, nor the line #10 stones would live.]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[lf];B[lg];W[kg]C[z: Unnecessary.  If W wants to hurt B, then play the cutting play (demonstrated earlier) on the line #10 stones, or play something like N10 to reduce B's potential center territory.]

;B[aj];W[al];B[se];W[sd];B[sf];W[rc];B[fi]C[z: I prefer a strong connecting play to secure the line #10 stones.]
;W[fh];B[mn]C[z: Line #10 is not yet secure.  I wonder if W will catch them, or if W will give B a break like B gave W in the lower right corner.]
;W[nm];B[mo];W[gi];B[fj];W[hj]C[octan8: somehow I didnt see this in time

z: This hurts.  I was wondering for a long time if W would ever try this capture.]
;B[dl]
(;W[el]C[octan8: Im pretty sure a white C11 would have killed

z: If W C11, then I think B can get a ko.  But it's a HUGE ko, and I do not presume to know how it would play out.]

[ma]C[z: In summary, B wins the game by a wide (12.5 point) margin. However, it could have been an early landslide.  

z: In the early fuseki, I prefered B's play.  I think B was building a significant lead.  However, B missed a key attack (lower right) and tried to attack when there wasn't one (stone #53).

z: As the game progressed, both players placed many excellent stones, and many that appeared slack.  I find the middle game to be somewhat of a wash.

z:  In the endgame, both players seem to place many stones that were not sente.  ...and even some stones that were entirely unnecessary.

z:  In the end, B's early lead remained.  I don't feel that W ever got into a full rhythm, and this was a big factor in the game.  Both players made some excellent plays, and some significant mistakes.

z: For future improvement, I would recommend considering the importance of threatening to capture without intent of capture. If you can place a stone that is sente because it threatens to capture your opponent, and that same stone gives you significant benefit (even after your opponent's easily predictable response to the threat), then you will win games.  I know that is easier said than done, but please strive to achieve this goal.

z: Also, when you decide to punish your opponent, make certain to read out the punishment and its options.  This is also easier said than done, but can be practiced with life-and-death problems.

z: As a final note, thank you for providing an interesting game to review.  I believe that both players demonstrate outstanding growth potential as Go players, for they both appear willing to try different things, and experiment with interesting approaches to a given situation.  I wish you the best of fortune in your games.  --zenjutsu]
