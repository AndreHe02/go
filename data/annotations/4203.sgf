C[Brodie:  Hello.  I hope my review is helpful.  If I'm not clear on anything, feel free to contact me, and I'll try to clarify. 

Enjoy. =o)];B[pd];W[pp];B[cp];W[dd];B[eq];W[jq];B[cj];W[ch]
;B[qn];W[pn];B[pm];W[qo];B[qm];W[on];B[om]SQ[nc][nd]C[Brodie:  At this point white plays  O17.  The following sequence of moves turns out pretty good for black.  It makes a nice wall on the outside, and with the stones at P7 black has mapped out a pretty big area. 

White also does pretty well along the top so it isn't really a bad play.  

An alternative might be O16.   O17 plays low and gives black the outside, which might work out  well for black.  O16 is higher, and so white can keep some control towards the center.]

;W[qd]C[Brodie:  Not much can come from doing this.  It would be better to just play K15 now.

This forces black to strengthen his position, which is not a good thing for white.  The two cutting points Q15 and R16 could be used as threats later when white tries to invade in the area.  So in a way, this makes things more difficult down the road.]
;B[pe];W[rc];B[qb];W[sb];B[rd];W[je]C[Brodie: good!];B[lf];W[pj]
C[Brodie:  This might be a bit too deep!  White is starting to have pretty big territory along the top as well as the bottom right, so I'm not sure that this invasion is all that necessary.]
;B[nk];W[qh]C[Brodie:  This move seems to aim at playing low and making eyes.  The bottom side is open to black, so that would be pretty hard.  Maybe it would be better to just run away.


(variation at O11 and P12)]
(;B[ph]C[Brodie:   Touching like this usually isn't a good idea.  It started some fighting and it ended up with seki.  Which turns out good for white.

For black, P12 and O11 would seem like reasonable choices.]

C[Brodie:  This gives white too many points to cut at!];W[oj]
C[(variation at N8)]
(;B[rj]TR[mk]C[Brodie:  White is still quite far from making two eyes, and O9, N10, and P12 can be cut apart. 

Black needs to reinforce a bit here, N8 perhaps];W[qh];B[si]
C[Brodie:  At this point white has a good opportunity to try to make a getaway into the center. CUT CUT CUT!

C[Brodie:  Black can still beat white.  After the silly mistake by White in a few moves, black manages to make an eye.  As a result, the position does not end in seki.

Playing at S5, Black could make an eye right now!

C[Brodie:  So what did this invasion acomplish?  

First, it made black's territory along the top completely solid! So there's no longer any hope of reducing it.  

More interestingly, White managed to get a nice wall at M7 so white's bottom territory is getting larger and more solid.  This was a good outcome from attacking]

--------
White: 

Careful with the invasions! If you don't have room to make eyes, either try to run away, and salvage something, or try to find some other way to cut even.  Maybe start cutting things on the outside and get some kind of wall out of it.  The wall at M7 for instance.  Something pretty good did come out of the invasion because of that.  

Also,  don't just cut and play forcing moves for no reason. =)  They strengthen the other player, and later on you might wish you hadn't.

Finally, judging from the invasions, you seem to be a fan of taking risks.  Try not to over protect yourself.  N5 and R3 got you behind in a hurry, so you likely would have been better off taking the risk.
--------
--------
Black:

You did quite well at thwarting white's big invasions.  Invasions scare me, so good job!  One thing to watch is how you handle them.  Cutting and fighting might be necessary to stop an invasion, but don't go overboard.  In the invasion on the right, you spread yourself a little thin and gave white lots of opportunities to turn things around.

Well played; it was fun to watch!
