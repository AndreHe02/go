AB[pd][dp]C[This is a game I played at KGS. I always have problems with time running out, which often leads to stupid mistakes in lategame. In this game I was also having trouble with handling my opponent in early-midgame (I think I could have played evenly with my opponent even without handicap stones) so I'd especially like to get some hints for improving in early-midgame.

I included quite many questions and my own thoughts in first half of the game. Please add your own thoughts of those situations. Of course, comments on other situations are welcome as well.

When playing handicap games as white, even results often aren't enough. If you have any ideas how I could have made the game more difficult for my opponent (allowing me to benefit from his mistakes), please let me know. I don't like doing some very basic tricks, because my opponent does not fall to my trick, it sets me more behind.

In lategame, I made a lot of mistakes, because I was running out of time.. If there are mistakes I haven't commented on, please point them out.

Thank you in advance for your review.

Hi, I am Laurent L. from France. I play on KGS as "lorl" (1k).
my comments are followed by "LL". 

Generally speaking on handicap games (especially with small handi like 2 stones), you don't need thinking about trick play to fool your opponent. That is the best way to fool yourself. So, just play active but normally. If the handi is justified, you will be able to detect opponent mistakes and benefit of them.

What would be the best of those or are there even better moves somewhere else? I think tenuki would leave D15-group too weak. Am I right or should I also consider tenuki as an option?
(UserkaffeI)

I agree that this move is not good, but I don't feel A or B are really interesting here.
I would play something like C, beginning by reinforcing white's group before attacking...

this move is the correct one.

this move is not bad, but I prefer A, which work well with white's framework on the right.
