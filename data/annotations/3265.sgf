C[I played white in this game.  I would particularly appreciate comments about the direction of play in the first 50 moves or so.  Thanks for reviewing this.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[dd]C[I feel that this isn't black's best move here, but not sure of the best way to take (slight) advantage.



klin: Unusal ply for B.];W[dc];B[cd];W[cc];B[cg];W[cj];B[cn]
C[I think this is a bit ambitious, saying: "I will mess up your side of the board and I'm betting you can't use your advantage here correctly."  But I'm a bit lost for the best way to take advantage here.]
;W[co]C[So I probably shouldn't strengthen the stone that is surrounding my c10, but b comes out anyway and gets something of a base if I play f4.



klin: W C5 a good move.];B[dn];W[fp];B[cl];W[ej]C[I'm happy with this so far.



klin: W double-attack two b groups.];B[fn];W[ed]C[Better move to pressure UL?  I thought about e13, but wasn't sure how to follow up.



klin: E16 good so is E13.  I probably would play E13.];B[df]
C[klin: B D14 should E13.];W[hp]C[klin: W H4 should continue to attack the upper B group at E13 or F14.]
;B[ee]C[klin: After E15, W two stones suddenly become very thin.]
;W[gd]C[klin: W G16 should G10.];B[ge];W[he];B[gf];W[gj];B[hg]
;W[id]C[klin: W J16 greedy.  J10 is the point.];B[hn]C[klin: B plays very soft.]
;W[jp]C[I felt confident I could live with the line 10 group, and thought the  move at k4 would help offset the influence b got.  Bad reasoning?   Should I just play k10?  Seems like b will get the upper hand pressuring my bottom while expanding his moyo and simultaneously strengthening his line 6 group.  Plus the right side is under his influence already.   Is L3 possible?



klin: W is greedy.];B[ij];W[hl]C[I wasn't sure how much I should threaten/try to get out and how much I should just make shape inside at this point.



klin: If you face a stroger player, W group will be killed.]
;B[hk]C[klin: B H9 should cut at G9.];W[gk];B[gl];W[fl];B[gm]
;W[em];B[en];W[ck];B[dl];W[fh];B[hi]C[klin: B H11 soft.];W[dh]
;B[bi];W[ci];B[bh];W[gi];B[gh];W[el];B[dk];W[ek]C[klin: W lives too easy.]
;B[lq]C[I was very unsure how to respond here.];W[qj]C[So, when in doubt, tenuki.  ;-)



klin: R10 OK, but if Q10 better.  Now B has influence out side, W has territory.  R10 is at low position, good for terriptoy, not for influence.  It is not balanced.  When you play against weak players, they don't know how to use influence.  You grab territory is easier to win.  But it is not a good way to improve.]
;B[qg];W[qm];B[qo]C[not the best result for white?];W[jq]C[I thought if I made a move for my line R stones, my bottom left would be decimated by the corner invasion and moves like j3.  So I thought I'd  secure some territory and induce b to induce me to defend the R line.



klin: R10 big terriory move.  But based on my earlier analysis, L5 may be better.]
;B[lo];W[nc]C[But then I thought m5 was a bit too distant to kill my side, and I'd take the sente to expand the top.  Should this be p7?  A black move around p/o/n 17 seems too much to allow, especially with c3 still available for b.



klin: W R7 and R10 two stone are very thin now.];B[oc];W[nd]
;B[rl]C[I was happy with this, I thought b should press me from the top and make territory.  Was this b's best attacking move?



klin: S8 is an option, even a good way to attack.  If if B attack from top, does not mean it wants territory.]
;W[ql];B[rk];W[qk]C[Other moves here?];B[rm];W[nm]C[Not sure the best way to make shape.]
;B[nk];W[qh];B[rg]C[klin: B S13 should at Q13.];W[oj];B[ok]
;W[oh];B[of];W[mi];B[lk];W[mg];B[mf];W[pg];B[pf];W[me];B[ne]
C[klin: B O15 unbelieveable.  It has to play at M14];W[lf];B[nf]
;W[le];B[lg];W[lh];B[kg];W[pk];B[og];W[ph];B[nh];W[ni];B[ri]
;W[qi];B[pi]C[I thought b should just q6 here.  Got lucky.



klin: Now you know.  No comment after this move.];W[ol];B[pn]
