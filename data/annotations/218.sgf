(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[General  comment: What I think is missing from White's side in this game is serious  attacking. Black could quite easily (sometimes forced to) solidify his  positions, while White had several weak spots for Black to attack.]

C[After mapping  out the territory along the upper right side I think answering at S18 is  worthwhile. Black can still peep on the inside (R15), but it will be much  harder for him.]

(;W[on]M[jp]C[Exchanging P4 for O4  first can't be bad with the marked stone in place. Another alternative is to  play a pincer again. (See variations.)]
;B[oq];W[pq];B[kq];W[jq];B[kp];W[ko];B[lo];W[ln];B[mo];W[mn];B[fp]C[Painful for  White. White really needed to play D2 or C3 first.]
;W[no]C[This  forces Black to live. White N3 (to keep Black unsetled), answering at G4,  or defending cutting points with  K6 comes to mind.]

[nr]C[An  overplay. Simply Q2, threatening this peep defends the corner in sente.]
;B[or];W[op];B[nq]C[White's lower right corner is  now wide open.];W[gp]
;B[eq];W[fr];B[er];W[lh]C[At this point I think White is behind. Black is strong all  over (only some opening along the mid-left side), while White has left  weaknesses behind in both upper and lower right corners, and must get quite a  lot of territory in the center to balance the game.]
;B[qe]
(;W[qf]C[A peep should (almost) always be answered in the "obvious" way.  The territory in this corner is gone, but White Q15 will at least give less  to Black.

;W[rf];B[sc];W[fe]C[Pushing this gently  from the outside will only help Black building territory. Thickness (the L16  stones) is best used for attack, not to build territory. Of course, at this  point it's hard to attack Black, since he is quite strong.]
;B[df];W[fg];B[dh];W[fi];B[gc];W[hd]C[The last eight moves gave White about 20 points of insecure territory in  the center. Black has made well over 30 points of very secure territory along  the edge and in the corner.]
;B[nf]C[This is a very threatening move  by Black. He now has a foot in White's domains from a strong position.]
;W[eo]C[Not sure about this move. Simply F6 seems better, if you want to  play around here at all.]
;B[do];W[fo];B[lg]C[From  now on, Black can just destroy as much white territory as possible. White  will hardly be able to touch Black's territories.]
