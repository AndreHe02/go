C[Hi :)

This is the second game , I am sending in , I hope someone can review it .
Though I played as 6k and my opponent as 11k (we played without HC) , I totally lost .
He killed a big group of mine .
So , now I think about if I am not 6k , or he isnt 11k .
I hope you enjoy reviewing this game :)

Hi Stefan,

My name is Riaan and I play at around 3k strength on KGS.  As such I'm not sure I can help you too much ^^

Hope you enjoy my review.

Riaan];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]
(;W[fd]C[R: I would prefer to pincer since it has a better relationship with D4.]
;B[cc];W[cb]C[This wasnt the best move , I guess .];B[cd];W[eb]
;B[ch]C[R: This is still OK.  You both have very strong groups and you have initiative.]
;W[nc]C[R: I think this is a bit overconcentrated... you have so many stones on the top side already.  Since you are so strong there i don't think the top side is very interesting.  I would prefer O3.]
;B[qg];W[jd]TR[lc][hd]C[R: Now you are extremely overconcentrated.  Your territory is not even secure and you have lost the initiative.  Big weaknesses remain.  Rather spread your influence on the board with a move like O3.]
;B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl];W[nq]C[R: This is too far.  K3 is the move.]
;B[hq]C[Here , the trouble began ~.~

R: Yes, O3 is too far.  I think K3 is the way to go if you want to play on this side.]
;W[jq]TR[lq]C[I tried to attack and make some kinda base on the right side.
But now I think I am weakening my group with that move .

R: Yes, F4 becomes really weak and M3 remains.];B[ho];W[qn]
C[R: This looks a little desperate...  How to respond to P5?  You are forcing black to split you and create two weak groups.]
;B[pn];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[po];W[qm]C[This was wrong I think , because of the bad aji from black S6 .]
;B[pm];W[ql];B[lq]C[R: This is really horrible for white.  You should not have created another group.]
;W[jo];B[fr]C[R: Very hard to answer... The proverb goes: Run before living.  Perhaps something like D7?]
;W[bq];B[cp];W[eq];B[er];W[dr];B[eo];W[gq]C[R: This is not good.  You are forcing black to become stronger.]
;B[gr];W[hp];B[ip];W[gp];B[iq];W[io];B[ep];W[fq];B[do];W[dq]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[kq];W[jr]C[R: These moves are really not doing anything but hurting you.  Trying to capture G2 is not reasonable.]
;B[ir];W[gn];B[hn];W[fn];B[hm]
(;W[bs]C[This was the wrong vital point , I guess ?  

R: No way to live in the corner anyway.  You should run.];B[fl]
C[R: Great move from black.  Forces you to live and he can make a lot of territory around E2 if he follows up at F15.]
(;W[nf]C[R: Black has given you a chance.  You should live now.  A2 is the move.  This really doesn't do enough.]
;B[pb];W[eg]C[R: Did you think D2 was alive here?  This jump is too far also and will surely be cut.  I think you should rather play solidly at F14 if you are intent on ignoring the killing move at A2 ^^]
;B[fe]
(;W[ge];B[ff]C[R: This way you don't make many more points and the cut at G16 makes you lose initiaive.]
;W[gd];B[gf]C[R: Black will be delighted with this.];W[hf];B[hg]
;W[ig];B[hh];W[if];B[ih];W[qi];B[ar]C[R: :( You missed your chance.  Bigger than O14 or J14 don't you think?]
;W[aq];B[ds];W[cs];B[br];W[es]C[It died :(];B[kr];W[jh];B[ji]
;W[kh];B[ki];W[li];B[lj];W[mi];B[nb];W[oc]C[Better N18 ?

R: Yes.  Remember you have invested about 15 moves to make this territory :D]

;B[nr]C[R: I think you should work on some life and death if you thought D2 was alive.  It is a very typical shape.  You should look closely at what your stones are doing and make sure that they are doing what you want them to do.  Your stones were very inefficient and it didn't really seem like you had a plan in your game.  Ideally you should ask yourself a few questions before making every move:

1. Do I have any weak groups?  If so, help the biggest one ^^
2. Does my opponent have any weak groups?  If so, attack them.
3. Where can I secure the most points.

The status of groups are more important than big points since they relate better to sente and maintaining sente in future.  You should also try harder to maintain sente in the opening and avoid getting overconcentrated.

Hope my comments were at all helpful!

Kind regards,
Riaan])
(;W[gd]C[R: I think you should play this way and fight to save E13 since you played it in the first place.]
