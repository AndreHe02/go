(;W[eq]C[Mattias> In my opinion this is a little slow. I would rather approach blacks corner.]
;B[cn]
(;W[dk]C[Mattias> If you play this move on 3'rd line it is more severe and forces black to jump to center. I think black made a misstake to play so close to your strong corner. You should attack and make territory.]
;B[cl]C[Mattias> Now black have a base and an at least one eye. Too comfortable for him.]
;W[dh]TR[cl]C[Mattias> This move looks like you try to make eye shape but the problem is that you are on the 4'th line and black have the marked stone at the 3'rd line. Easy for black to attack.]

(;B[ck]C[Mattias> Like this.];W[cj];B[cg]C[Mattias> Black wastes no time and keep attacking.]

(;W[go]C[Should this have been a one space jump as opposed to direct attachment?

Mattias> I am not sure what you mean. But One line higher would be a lot better. Now black can break through and you see in variations how it can look. Here you should connect your stones.]
;B[gn]C[Mattias> Bad shape for white and it is hard to handle this good.]

(;W[jp]C[In hindsight, this move should not have been played, and played at H6?

Mattias> H6 does not seem to be so good. K4 is much better than H6.]
;B[gl];W[fk]C[Mattias> You save correct stone.];B[hm];W[qc]
;B[pc]C[Mattias> Black defend correct. He will get a good territory.]

;B[fo];W[gp];B[fp];W[fq];B[do]C[I assume the purpose of this move was to attack the gap between C4 and E5? This consequently resulted in the following move at D4

(;W[ie]C[Was this too late to play the hane? Should this have been done earlier to avoid black controlling a large part of the top?

Mattias> Here it does no good. Black is too strong. Better to just play J14 below. Or even better at K13.]
;B[if];W[ig];B[jf];W[jg];B[kg];W[kh]C[Crosscut at L14 instead of chasing to try and kill the group of stones at J14,K14 and K15? If not to at least reduce the territory in the upper side of the board

Mattias> Your move is better than L14.];B[lh]
(;W[lg];B[kf];W[li];B[mh];W[mi];B[nh]
(;W[oh]C[Should this have been a space jump rather than to try directly block black's path?

Mattias> I am not sure what you are aiming at. If you want to cut black you must do some preparation first.]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[nj];W[cc]C[Mattias> This is a little too late. Black is strong.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[df];B[bd];W[ae]C[This is a mistake. There was no reason to play this move.]
;B[ad];W[db];B[bc];W[bb]C[Another mistake. Not counting liberties and trying to capture the black group.

Mattias> Try to count liberties of all local groups before playing. Play slower and read a couple of moves ahead.
It is very hard but if you solve many easy problems you will get better at it.]

C[Mattias> Overplay];B[me];W[nc];B[od];W[mc];B[nb];W[lb]C[The previous moves attempted to force black into a large mass of stone to capture. In hindsight this was a mistake as black can easily form two eyes.]
;B[mb];W[kc];B[kd];W[ld];B[kb];W[oc];B[pb];W[la];B[lc];W[ij]
;B[le]C[Mattias> Good try!!! You started a ko. The problem was to find a good ko threat. Another problem was that you did not have so many liberties. The secret with finding a ko threat is to play in a place where playing two moves in a row is bigger than the ko. For you is doesn't matter much if you lose the ko but it is very bad for black to lose it. So he will win the ko but you will gain somewhere else. You play a threat and black ends the ko like he did and you place your second stone. Two moves in a row for free.]
