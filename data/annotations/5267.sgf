This game was played on KSG. Komi is 0.5p and I am playing white.

[[Hello - my name's Adam, and I'll be reviewing this game.  My remarks are in double brackets.  I am only a 5 kyu, so I don't have the "right" answers to your questions, but I hope that my commentary will help to stimulate your own thinking about the game.\]\]]

;B[fo]C[[[This is generally considered a weak reply to the one-space pincer - but most of the usual replies won't work here because of C6.  This is the price Black plays for abandoning F3 instead of playing out the joseki.\]\]]
;W[kq];B[dr];W[cq];B[gr]
(;W[nq]C[Is this reasonable, or should W try to strengthen his group in some other way?

[[This seems fine.  It both helps your bottom group to live and serves as a kakari to Q4 - gotta love those dual-purpose moves.\]\]

Mabye W at G3, threatening to cut with F4?

[[See the variation to see what this would look like.\]\]];B[qn]
;W[pr]TR[ho][no]C[W still dont feel to safe. So I figured I should play one of the marked positions.

[[Sure. Your group is already almost certain to live, but a small life along the side is not necessarily worth cheering for.\]\]]
;B[qq];W[dj];B[bj];W[cj]C[Any better way for W to respond?  This move looks strange to me, but I think I have seen it played by other people, so I decided to try it.

[[What are you trying to accomplish?  This is a nose attachment, which can be a very good play in some circumstances.  I'm not going to say it's a bad play here, but in general, it's not a good idea to attack with contact.  Are you trying to kill B10?  Do you think that's possible given the number of stones in the area?  Alternatively: say you hem Black in and force him to make a tiny life along the second line while you build a huge, thick white wall on the left.  Wouldn't that be more than adequate compensation?\]\]]
;B[bh];W[bk];B[ci];W[aj]C[[[It seems too early to play on the first line unless it's a killing move.\]\]]
;B[cg]TR[dd][cf]SQ[fc][bh][ci]C[[[Note that now the group you were attacking is putting a squeeze play on your triangled stones. The hunter has become the hunted.\]\]]

(;W[fg];B[ff];W[gf];B[ee];W[ed];B[ge];W[fd]C[Black has escaped to the center. So I figure I should try to get a few points at the upper side.

[[Black had escaped to the center long before, when you tried to kill his group instead of building a wall preventing him from running out.  See the comment on the variant for 44.\]\]]
;B[gg];W[gd];B[gh];W[he];B[jc];W[pc]C[How do I deal with this upper right part of the board?

I decided to try something different from a 3-3 invation because I thought blacks wall would be to strong.

[[I don't think it makes a huge difference, since you don't have anything nearby to connect to.\]\]]
;B[oc];W[qd];B[qc];W[pb];B[qe];W[rd];B[ob];W[pe]C[[[Why cut now?  (This isn't a criticism, but a question: the answer is in the comments for 69.)\]\]]
;B[od]
(;W[qb];B[re];W[rc];B[pf]C[[[Imagine that Q15 and Q14 weren't on the board.  Would you play Q15, knowing that Black would answer at Q14?  If not, then you shouldn't have played it at 64.  Cutting at Q15 at 64 pretty much commits you to playing your *variant* 66, not the 66 from the actual game.\]\]

[[Now, that said, note that the one advantage of Q15 here is that it may give you a free move around G6, since that would then become a ladder-breaker.\]\]]
;W[no]C[[[So you could have considered something like H6 here.  Of course, O5 is also a good double-purpose move, making your bottom area less flat while helping to prevent Black from developing a moyo on the right side.\]\]]

;B[iq]
(;W[jr];B[ip];W[ql]C[I have no idea what to do here. I cant find any places to make more territory, so I try to destroy blacks.

[[That seems reasonable.  This is a good, vulnerable point, and you even have stones nearby.\]\]]

;B[ng];W[ph];B[qh];W[nh];B[mg];W[mk];B[lo];W[lp];B[gc]C[I was sure F17 was dead. But no he manages to link it up.

If I had seen this play, I would have prevented it earlier.

[[Yeah, that's unfortunate.  G17 would have been good at 98 or 100.\]\]]
;W[hc];B[de];W[ce];B[hb];W[ic]C[Bad move?

[[No, this is sente.  Since Black must respond at J18, you got a free push to the right.  You wouldn't have wanted Black to play here.  That said, you really want to follow this up.\]\]]
;B[ib]
(;W[ec]TR[dd][ed]C[[[Empty triangle.  Always try to find an alternative to the empty triangle - it is only very rarely that it is correct.  If I had been considering E17, I would automatically have switched to E18 and tried reading that out first.\]\]]
;B[ad];W[ac];B[af];W[bc];B[bi]C[[[Very bad move for Black.\]\]]
;W[je]C[[[Good punishment.  Black should have played around here first.\]\]]
;B[ld];W[dl]C[[[Why not at E7?\]\]];B[bl];W[cl];B[co];W[do]
C[[[Was Black playing under time pressure?  These are bad moves.\]\]

[[In fact, I see that the rest of the game is you climbing back to what, with komi, would have been a victory.  There are various places where I might have tried different plays, but nothing that makes me say, "Ah ha, you lost the endgame here."  So my commentary ends here.  Good luck!\]\]]

[[Yes!  That is a good insight.  One step to improvement is to play *consistently*.  You didn't play R17 because you didn't want to be sealed in... so why turn around and let yourself be sealed in?\]\]]

 Instead of just thinking kill,kill,kill...

[[Best of all is to build a great position while sealing him in.  Building a great position while chasing him out is also very good.  Trying for a kill and failing is a good way to lose the game.  Note that you have been playing almost entirely contact moves - don't attack with contact moves!\]\]]
