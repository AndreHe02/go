C[Hey there--I am fairly new to Go, though I have known how to play for some time. About a month ago I decided to focus on it for a while and see whether I could improve. As a result, I know *about* a lot of concepts, but have little sense of how they may appear in games or how I can put them to use.

I played this game over about two weeks on the Dragon Go Server. At the start, both players were rated 22k. I am white.

S:Hi there in this review i will point some of your mistake and show you couple of variotion of playing them properly.I'm not too strong have about 10 kyu rating but i thing i could help you somehow.In advice sorry for my english:) My comment starts with S]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qj];W[nc];B[oc]MA[qj]C[I met this response frequently when "warming up" with 13x13 games, and was often frustrated by it on that size board. Here, I felt like he's giving me a strong unit right near an important corner.

S:Black p17 in not bad becouse of the marked stone it helps him to be not close in the corner. See ther variotion without r10 stone]
(;W[nd];B[jc]C[I'd kind of expected him to reinforce somewhere around q13, so this gives me the idea to try and isolate his corner. I think I get far too aggressive too soon in pursuit of this. Looking back, I wonder whether I should have approached his UL corner with c13 or c14.

S: The stone r 10 reinforce the UR so it would be really dificult to isolate the corner]
;W[of];B[pf];W[oh];B[cj]
(;W[qh]C[This is where I start to get really greedy. In my mind, the bottom half of the board is mine (I should already know better!); and it seems that, at the least, I can squeeze his r10 stone downward.

S: you should play simple q13];B[qg]C[S:bad move black]
(;W[pg];B[qe];W[rg]MA[df][fd][jp][pm]C[S: Slow move marked place are good move]
;B[qf];W[oj]C[I wanted to keep his r10 stone from creeping out toward the center, but it seems like the situation in the UR is far from settled. The s13 stone is dangling out there, and I have no good reply if he plays q11.

S: yes you're right but another slow move:)]
(;B[rf]C[But he plays very defensively.]
(;W[rh]C[As it happens, most of the LR does become my territory, but more because of a lack of tactical alertness by my opponent.

S: Small move give hime taht 3 point and play somewher else. Locally see variation]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[pn];W[on]MA[ol]C[S: This two move are too close]
(;B[qp];W[qq];B[rq];W[rp];B[qo];W[rr]C[
Clearly an overplay. It seems now like q3 might have been better, letting black live fairly small on the R and giving me some strength to fight in the center and along the bottom. In my defense, it's around this point that I realize that, for all my pressuring black, I have no real territory sketched out.

Much of what follows is my attempt to build "influence" for the sake of "fighting," which my newbie's brain hopes may still result in victory.

S: yes you're right simply q3 is good];B[pq];W[sq]C[I'm looking for life in the corner, but I wonder if I might have been better off sacrificing these stones to secure a frontier along the P-line.]
;B[op];W[ro];B[po];W[pr];B[or]C[I should stop pressing here, since my LR group appears to be alive. But I'm looking at the chunk above q7 and I wonder whether I can cut it off.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[pm];B[ql];W[qm];B[rm];W[om];B[ri]
(;W[qn];B[rn]C[Separating these groups would prove valuable later; but it seems to me that black's group should still be able to live.]
(;W[jp]C[I realize that my LR group is alive. I have little influence elsewhere on the board, so I play for a remaining big point, though it's facing his strength.]
;B[lq]
(;W[kq]C[Trying to make him as small as possible.

S: m5 better protect much more teritory in center and dont give much black]
(;B[ko];W[jo];B[kn];W[jm]C[Stepping ahead so that I can try to maintain some position in the center. If he pokes at k6 my #56 stone should have access to a ladder breaker on the R.

S: Good thinking]
(;B[km];W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[lk]C[My general intent is to press him back onto my stones. I have hopes of killing him, but I know it's a longshot.

S: Once more good thinking Its difficult to make a eye in the center]
;W[lj];B[mj];W[li];B[mi];W[mh];B[pj];W[ni]
(;B[nk];W[nj]C[I think this is a mistake.

S: You're right]
(;B[mk];W[ok];B[nm];W[mn];B[nn];W[no];B[oo];W[mm];B[lm]
(;W[nl]C[I couldn't work out whether another move might keep him from connecting to his eye at q4--at least, I had a sense that a play at n5 might not be able to accomplish this before that group of white stones was killed. So I take the immediate points.
S: i too dont see any way too disconnect];B[kp];W[jq];B[ps]
;W[qr];B[mo];W[np];B[nq];W[mp];B[lp];W[mq];B[mr]C[And so he connects. I turn my attentions again to the question, "Where are the points going to come from?"]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[jn];B[kr];W[jr];B[js];W[ml]C[I get a freebie because of his group's lack of liberties.]
;B[lr];W[ir];B[co];W[cp];B[ep];W[eo];B[fp]
(;W[fo];B[do];W[eq];B[fq];W[dr]C[An obvious mistake--should be at e2. Again, my mind is running right to the idea of killing stones, and I'd conceived of this plan to sacrifice a stone and make him into a classic "dango" shape. Too much knowledge, not enough wisdom...]
;B[er];W[fr];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[gr];B[cr];W[br];B[ds];W[bo]
C[I'm in more trouble here than I realized when I began, thanks to the lack of liberties of the c3-c4-d4 group.  120 at b5, 121 at b4, 122 connects at b3, if black 123 extends to a4, W124 at a5 is IMPERATIVE.]
(;B[bn]
(;W[cn]C[It's too bad I'm an idiot. I think I can live with a5.

S: bad idea:)];B[dn];W[cm];B[bp];W[bq]C[This was a "hope" stone, hoping my opponent would make a mistake.]
;B[ao];W[dm]
(;B[bs]C[This insurance move by black gives me an important initiative. Looking back now, I don't know how I would have answered e6.

S: It would be pain in the ass I propably will resign];W[en]
;B[bo];W[ej]C[In my heart, I know I've lost this game. I considered the 3-3 invasion in the UL, but I felt that my best shot at making it close was to stick with the idea of using my wall to make some territory in the center.

S: good idea];B[dl];W[el];B[dj];W[eh];B[dh];W[ef];B[df];W[ed]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc];W[jd];B[lc]C[This was the safe move, of course, but I suspect a more aggressive move like L16 might have been better.]
;W[ld]C[S: black give you too much:)];B[nb]
(;W[od];B[pb];W[dk]C[Our walls riddled with holes, and my sente gives me a lot I can do. Still, I'm certain I must have lost this game. I play quickly and aggressively for a while, thinking "a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[bl];W[bk];B[bm];W[em];B[bj];W[ak];B[al];W[aj]
;B[ai]C[S: good moves here];W[ek];B[bh]C[It's around this point that I actually begin to notice that my moyo is large, and his corner territories are fairly constrained. I don't (of course) bother to count yet, but I pat myself on the back for keeping the game close.]
(;W[go]C[There are a few areas that need patching up--here and in the UR.

S: You should keep your sente];B[gp];W[hp];B[fs]
(;W[gq];B[gs];W[hs];B[es];W[is];B[ks];W[mc];B[kd];W[ke];B[kc]
C[I don't know whether black thought he was winning here, and just going after the small points. If I were him, and I knew I was down, I wonder if I might try to mix things up with 181 at m15, or something else that may take advantage of the unsettled situation in the UR.

S:Maybe he think his wining his moves from some point are really defencive]
;W[je]C[Probably the wrong side on which to connect, or maybe a hanging connection at m14 would have made me calmer about the potential cut at m12.]
;B[mb];W[de]C[I'm just not seeing the weak cutting point at m15. Later on I will really worry about things up here.

S: You dont see it becouse it havent got any:)];B[ce];W[dg]
;B[ee];W[fe]C[Again, I think I'm behind, and trying to be aggressive in the hopes of breaking through into his UL.  

S: must learn count you're winning];B[de];W[cg];B[bf];W[bg]
;B[ag];W[ch];B[di]C[A terrible mistake. I take heart.];W[ei]
;B[cf]C[S: good killing sequence];W[ci];B[ah];W[bi];B[af]C[At this point, I take a careful look at things. The points are close, and much seems to hinge on the outcome of the still unsettled right side. The more I look at things, the more I suspect that black's middle-right group is clinging to life by a thread. That afternoon, I even got out a real board and some stones and tried to plan my way through.]
;W[qi]
(;B[rk]C[I think this kills him off right away. I'm still not sure whether, absent this move, he's alive or dead. My best guess was that something like t10 could have saved him.

S: he was dead:)];W[si];B[rj];W[sl];B[rl];W[pi];B[qs];W[rs]
;B[os];W[mo];B[oe];W[ne]C[After I made this move, I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. If only I'd taken a minute and pulled back to o14 before blocking, things would have been much simpler. My fear is that this group has very few liberties, and yet there are spots to cut at both o14 and m15.

S: You're right];B[pe];W[mf]C[Trying to guard both cutting points, breathing a sigh of relief.]

I feel like I learned a lot over the course of this game, mostly about trying to stay tactically alert and keeping a close eye on potential territory. But I'm very interested to hear what an experienced player may have to say. Thank you very much. --JDP

S: ok i will try to sum up. First try to avoid small move at the begining. Dont coplicate youre game simply move are good one:) Dont play that close move protecting the center becouse it really easy to break throw them. In your next game try to play fighting game solve some problems( life and death especially you have good knowledge of this game if you want to improve you must improve your reading skill and shape knowledge.i think thats all.ONce more sorry for english if you wish too play some game. Give me an invite on dgs my nick is Szynx]
