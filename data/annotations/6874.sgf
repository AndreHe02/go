C[Randy: Towards the end of this game i did alot of silly things because of time limit and feeling pressured and behind but I think i made some critical errors early.  I felt good about some of the opening and thought I had a good shot and I just fell apart.

RS: Hi Randy. I'm Rex Santoro. I'm 8k on DGS (Dragon Go Server). Let me say that if anyone of a higher rank then I says something different, give her/his opinion precedence. Apart from that, I hope I can help you. If I write anything that is confusing, please write back for clarification.]

(;B[cc]C[RS: I see you like jumping into the 3-3 point. However, as you saw here it does not work because of Wc14. If Wc14 were at c10, *then* the 3-3 invasion would be good. The reason you jump into the 3-3 point is to take away the coner, but because of Wc14, W can cut you off by playing d17 as he did in the game. I would prefer the variation.]

(;B[dl]C[RS: Hmmmm, this move tells me you are worried about W getting territory or too much of it on the left. One of the ground rules for go is to try too split your opponent's groups, which is easy for W to do here by playing e7. You will then have 2 weak groups. A weak group without any eyes takes 20 points away from your score. Two of them means -40 points. I know you later connected them but that was only because W did not take advantage of the situation. See the variation for one idea.]
;W[dj];B[cq]C[RS: With this move, what you are saying to W is, "Please kill either the f3 group or the d8 group. You choose." I'm not sure that's what you wanted, but that's what you said. I believe d2 would have been better.

My desire would be to make life for my f3 group in sente and use Bd8 to reduce W as much as possible which is why I would play d2.]

(;B[bm]LB[do:1][co:1][cn:1][cq:2][fq:3][fo:4][en:5][dl:6][bm:7]
C[RS: Ok, a little fighting advice. In the lower left you have 7 groups. Even if you conside groups 1, 4 & 5 as one group, you still have 5 separate groups. Try not to have so many. So many groups means a lot of cutting points for W to cause you problems as you saw later in the game.

Next, count the liberties of each group. 1 has 2 liberties; 2, 1 lib; 3, 4; 4, 4; 5, 3; 6, 4, and 7, 3. 

The magic number concerning a group's liberties is 5. Anything less then this, and warning bells should go off in your head, unless you have read it out *exactly*. 5 may seem like a lot, but in a fight, liberties can disappear quickly. So, your last move, 7, should have been a simple extension to c5. See variation.]

C[RS: Good! This is a huge move, but as you saw your lower left group is weak without Be4. You will have to go back and connect here.]

;W[io];B[hr]C[RS: Ok, you're trying to get a huuuuge moyo AND W is cooperating. Bh2 is no good since you have to seal off your moyo at k6 or L7. Stay with your good strategy of making a huge moyo. Just realize W will invade, so plan as much as possible how to kill him.]

RS: Your strength in this game was seeing the bigger picture and not trying to save every stone. 

Your biggest weakness is fighting by have too many small groups involved in the same fight (See move 37). You do this about 10 times. In a fight, if you have 3 groups, one or two will die. Try to have only 1 or 2 groups in the same fight.

I hope it was helpful. Any questions? E-mail me.])
