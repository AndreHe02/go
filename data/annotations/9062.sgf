AB[pd][dp]C[Ethelor [17k\]: Hello, play well :)];W[qd]C[maks [15k\]: привет

S: How do I deal with people who dont use a standard opening?

Alex: Hey Simon,

i play as a 6 kyu on kgs. Recently i have not played very much, but the review of your game got me somewhat back in the game.

To your question: Well, i think the white response is not such a strange opening. Furthermore if you play someone in a handicap game, the white player usually will play more aggressily to regain blacks advantage.

As a meager guideline how to response to an unusual opening or an opening you did not encounter before i would say:

- invest more time than usual in the opening

- in doubt play safe and try to avoid complicated battles in one corner.

My overall advice after reviewing your game:

Try not to get sucked into small fights. There is no need to defend single stones, if their loss does not threatens bigger groups. Play more often tenuki. I commented at a few moves where your move should not have answered the opponent's play.]

;W[sd]C[Alex: The defence at S19 is not necessary. It's not even one point. S19 and T19 is a ko situation, but without a fellow up.

The right move here ist R14]

Alex: Yes, this is a useless move. the stone on m18 as no effect. you could play k18 if you want to fight there. in any case better than m18, but to fight k16 would better.

because white L18 does not threats your group you can also play some where else. I think that would be the best to do]

Alex: you can only try to avoid that mistakes. a way to do that, is in games where you lead to play very safe. that means to connect positions where there is a possibility for big, game losing mistakes or where you see potential for the opponent to try something. i quite often resort to such tactics.
