KM[5.5];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd];W[qf];B[qh];W[of]LB[qc:A]C[reid: White often plays into the corner at a (r17)
instead of jumping out.  But then black gets nice
thickness.  This way is certainly playable too.];B[nd];W[pi]C[bene: i think this variation(joseki) is good strategy to deal with
sanrensei. block the opponent's influence, and build mine. but not fully
mastered it.

reid:  I agree.  Of course, the tradeoff is that black gets some solid
territory.  White must be prepared to play a "thickness" oriented strategy
later on.

In my opinion, learning how to use (and oppose) thickness is *very*
important to getting stronger, so I say: go for it! :-)];B[ph];W[oh];B[qi]
;W[pj];B[qj];W[pk];B[ql];W[om]LB[pg:A][og:B][mf:C][qc:D][jp:E]C[reid:  The usual thing here is for white to go back and
patch up the cutting point with a move like a (q13), b (p13)
or even c (n14 - a fairly flimsy patch :-).  White considers
playing away (not fixing the cut) if he plans on using the
aji in the corner at d (r17) as a response to being cut.

The tradeoff for allowing the cut is that white gets a move
elsewhere: in this case, to build a wall facing the bottom.
If white already had a stone somewhere around e (k4) I'd say
this is a reasonable tradeoff.  But in the current position,
black may be able to take advantage of the cut in sente, and
then come back to destroy white's bottom moyo by playing around
e (k4) himself.  That leaves white with no good compensation for
allowing black the cut at b (p13).  So I'd have to recommend
following joseki here and fixing the cut first.

After all, if you want to end up with thickness facing the center,
you need to play enough stones so that your thickness is *thick* and
not full of cuts...];B[qn]LB[pg:A][og:B]C[bene: A(q13) cutting point is a burden.

reid: Yes.  Black can also play directly at b (p13).];W[pm]LB[on:A][pn:B]
C[bene: this move is not good-feeling, but i wanted to prevent A(p6)
in sente.

reid:  I agree, on both counts.  I think you should listen to your feelings :-)
In this case it was telling you to look a little further for the "right"
move (the one that "feels good").  How about b (q6) instead?  That seems
to give white a nice solid wall across half the board.

On the plus side, there is some aji here if black doesn't respond: see
variation 1.]
(;B[og]LB[pg:A][qm:B]C[bene: can you show me black A(q13) variation?

reid:  I don't think black wants to play at q13 in this shape.
First of all, it's an empty triangle: not too efficient.  White
would answer b a (q13) with a solid p13.  Then when black cuts at
b (q14) white can live in the corner with c (r17).  When all the
dust settles, it looks like black's right side is bigger than white's
corner (of course) but the massive thickness white gets on the
outside should be more than enough to compensate.  Since this was
black's area of influence to begin with, he will not be happy.

Another argument:  the black stones on the left side are already alive,
so cutting off just one or two stones is too small at this time.

So what black wants to do is to make defects in white's shape and hope
that he can take advantage of them later.  Who knows? maybe white will
allow him to patch up his bad aji at b (r7).]
(;W[pg]LB[ng:A][oi:B]C[reid:  Hmmm, I think I'd want to play on the other side at a (o13).
One of my goals when I play is to try to make all my stones work
together, to cooperate.  When white ataris at q13, black will naturally
extend to a (o13).  Then white will be separated into two rather weak groups,
and the weakness at p11 will be something that black can count as a
resource.

If instead white plays on the outside at a (o13), trying to enclose black,
black will naturally respond with the empty triangle of q13.  See variation
2 for more details.];B[ng]C[reid:  To me, black o13 feels like a dagger in my heart!  the three white
stones (q13, etc) are trying to fight against 6 black stones - not good
odds.];W[pl]LB[oi:A][nh:B]C[bene: i think this was unnecessary. O14.

reid:  Well, indirectly it re-enforces the weakness at a (p11)
a little bit.  But it helps black patch up his aji :-(  And black
is going to atari at b (o12) anyway, so this move becomes unnecessary.
Now p7 looks kinda funny :-(];B[nh];W[oi];B[re]LB[nf:A]C[bene: maybe should be O14.

reid:  If black a (o14) then there is still some room for life
in the corner.   Also, white needs to do something about the
aji at r9/r7.  I think s15 is good.];W[rf];B[qm];W[nf];B[mf]LB[lg:A]C[reid:  Now this black n14 looks a bit greedy to me :-)  Black
is ahead on territory at the moment, so he shouldn't be trying to
take more.  Instead, he should be trying to catch up in the
balance of power.  If he can chase this group while getting
thick in the center (to match white's thickness) he should win
the game (since he has territory and white doesn't.

I'd suggest just jumping safely to a (m13) instead.];W[me];B[ne];W[mg];B
[lf];W[mh]C[reid:  This capture puts white back in the game.];B[rp]LB[ro:A]
[qp:B]C[bene: i think this is small. or could black be dead?

reid:  I think you're right.  I don't see that white can kill
black.  On the other hand, this prevents a lot of sente white
moves (like white a - s5) so it't fairly big.

But if black has to play here, I think he should be more
aggresive:  black b (r4) at least!];W[jp]C[reid:  This is very big now.  If black can invade this area
easily, white would be left with nothing, so i think this is
a good time for this move.];B[dj]
(;W[cf]LB[fj:A][dm:B][fm:C][cl:D][el:E]C[bene: i even considered f10, then black d7, f7..that felt not good
because it would allow b big eyes. if w c8, then b e8..erasing center. c14
was to incur a battle and then hoping to utilize center influence.

reid:  I like the way you're thinking here :-)

I agree that white f10, etc is too easy for black.  The correct way to
use your center thickness is not to try to build territory with it, but
use it in a fight (as you suggest).  I think c14 is an excellent move.
I think if I were playing, I'd try to go even deeper, with a (d18) or  b (f17).  But that could just be my personal style :-)

Note: If you don't like exchanging white d (c8) for black e (e8)
you could consider playing at d8 or even e8 - which leads to
variation 3.];B[fd]LB[ce:A][df:B]C[reid:  Oh! too easy on white!  black should kick at a (c15).  white
will probably play b (d14) and then black can f16.];W[ef];B[qq]LB[cm:A]
[fj:B][dl:C][bd:D][ci:E][fg:F][gf:G][cc:H]C[bene: skip here and white c7 or f10?

reid:  Yes, this is not an important area to be playing in right now.
If white plays at r3, black will ignore it.  And white could ignore
it now.  That makes it and endgame play.  A *very* *big* endgame play,
but still endgame.  I'd probably play c (d8) for white now.  This pushes
black straight into your thickness.

I wouldn't want to play white f10 (inducing black to get easy life with
a - c7 or c6).

The two white stones at c14 have lots of room for life.  d (b16), e (c11),
and running at f (f13) or g (g14) all seem to give white easy prospects
for life (even after the exchange of white c - d8, black b -f10).
But white doesn't want to play d (d16) too soon: if the white group becomes
save because of the center fight, white will want to jump all the way into
the corner with h (c17) instead of d (d16).];W[pq];B[cn];W[cl]LB[en:A]C
[bene: this can be an overplay, but wanted a battle.

reid: Hmmm, yes, but I assume you want a battle where *you* have
the advantage :-)  In this case you already have one weak group, and  you are starting up a second (potentially weak) group.  This is usually
a recipe for disaster on the go board!  Better to make your weak
group strong first, *then* go looking for battles :-)

In this case, I'd consider playing at a (e6 - a move I almost *never*
recommend, but in this case, it looks pretty good).];B[en];W[el];B[fp]C
[reid:  Ouch!  This puts a big dent in white's moyo :-(];W[fo];B[eo];W[ep]
;B[gp];W[gn]LB[ho:A][fm:B]C[reid:  a (h5) and b (f7) are nice tesujis for pulling a stone
out of this kind of shape.  Usually better than the diagonal move.];B[fm]

(;W[cq]C[bene: i was not sure of corner life.

reid:  But did you notice that black can catch f5 in a ladder?
Try to read it out before looking at variation 4.];B[ho];W[hm];B[fl];W[ek]

;W[hi]C[reid:  White is too thin for this: see variation 5.]
(;B[fi];W[gg];B[fh];W[fg]C[bene: not very elegant move.

reid:  Hah!  you might want to read  _The Killer of Go_ by Sakata Eio, Honorary
Honinbo published by Yutopian Enterprises.  He says quite plainly that in his
opinion, given a choice between an elegant move, and a move that works, he'll
take the one that works every time :-)];B[eh];W[dh];B[hh];W[gh];B[gi];W
[ii];B[ig]LB[ji:A][eg:B]C[bene: seeing now, white e13 probably better.

reid:  Well, given that black can take the f5 stone if he needs to,
perhaps something like c (j9) is what's needed here.  After all, white
only needs to take one side or the other.  But if white f5 gets taken,
white won't get either side.];W[ji];B[eg];W[dg];B[ff];W[ln];B[ik]LB[il:A]
C[reid:  The vital point, but not quite the right sequence:  if
white answers with a (j8) black can only get a ko.  if black
starts with the sacrifice of h8, then f5 cannot be saved.];W[hl];B[hj];W

[ll];B[ki];W[kj];B[kk];W[lj];B[mk]C[bene: time was lacking, and mind desperate here.

reid:  Yes, I know how that is :-(  It looks pretty hard to salvage
this now...

I think you have good fighting spirit.  I like many parts of your game.
I would recommend that you work on trying to make your stones work
together as a team.  It is like commanding an army: individual soldiers
are nothing.  Only by working together as a team (with occasional sacrifices
for the good of the team) can your army achieve greatness.

In learning how to use thickness, it is important to make sure that your
shapes are *truly* thick.  I know it is sometimes hard to go back and take gote
to patch up a weakness, but if you don't, it ends up being many moves
of gote for you later (as he presses on that weakness).  It is usually not a
good idea to trade sente now for gote later.  Another way to look at it is
if you have no weaknesses left for hom to press on, then he has no sente
against you.  That means that by giving away the sente now, you get it back :-)]

(;W[el]LB[cl:A][fj:B][cc:C][cq:D]C[reid:  This might be interesting:  it gives black a choice of
a (c8) or b (f10).  Whichever one black takes, white takes the
other.

What I like about this sequence is that it leaves black with a
vulnerable weakness at c (c17).  Of course, white has a similar
point at d (c3).  But there's a subtle difference:  Once black has
committed some extra stones near d10, he has a hard time deciding
which way to block after white c17.  Should he block at d17, or at
c16?

For white, the decision is easy:  he will always block at d3.

I always like to give my opponent difficult decisions :-)]N[variation 3]
))
(;W[ng]N[variation 2];B[pg]LB[nh:A][qm:B][qd:C][nf:D][oi:E][qc:F]C[reid:  Now white has 4 cuts.  He should probably try to
fix at least one.  But which one?

The safest way to fix would be a (o12).  This preserves the
aji at b (r7).  But if black plays at c (r16), he gets a
pretty huge corner.

White could also try d (o14).  But then he has to worry about
the possible cuts at a (o12) or e (p11).

Perhaps the riskiest way is to try to save everything by connecting
at f (q14).  Black will cut at d (o14) and white will be trying to
juggle too many weaknesses.

I think what I'd do is to play into the corner with f (r17).  I know
black will take something on the outside, but I think I can probably
push him into over-concentrated shape if he does.]))
