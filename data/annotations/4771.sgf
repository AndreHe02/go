Komi: 6.5];B[qd]C[JM: Wim,
    Thanks for the opportunity to review your game!  It was an interesting match which both sides had a chance to win.

Please keep in mind that I am only 1kyu on IGS, so take all of my comments with a grain of salt.  Only the professionals can say definitively what the best move in a particular position is.

In the end, I think the game was mostly decided by the sequence in the lower left.  Black missed an opportunity when he played J3, but even before that, the creation of the white wall at D10 gave white a strong position.  There were, however, other crucial moments (and a few mistakes) which you correctly pointed out with your questions.  I've done my best to answer those questions.  All of my comments are preceded by 'JM:'.  Thanks again.

(;B[ck]C[Black 23 better at C7 or C8 ?

JM: Playing at C9 provokes white to come down at C10 and be strong.  On the other hand, white can respond to C8 at C9 and probably also get a black response.  C7 is rather thick, and might have trouble if white plays E7.

I think the best decision here would be to play E6.  The white wall at D10 ends up becoming an important factor in the game, and E6 seems to be the best way to avoid its formation.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[ek];B[el];W[fl];B[fk];W[ej];B[fm]C[Black 31 better at E7 ?

JM: Probably not.  White doesn't want to give black the ponuki, so either way black will be able to save his D9 stones.]
;W[gl];B[em];W[go];B[hn];W[gp]C[White 36 better at H5 ?

JM: Tough to tell, this is a difficult fight.];B[jo];W[ip]C[White 38 aji-keshi ?

JM: Not really.  This is a pretty good fight and white needs to do whatever he can to keep his C4 stones from getting in trouble.]
;B[jp];W[hq];B[hr];W[fq];B[gr];W[io];B[iq]C[Black 45 (loosing move ?) better at J6 ?

JM: J6 definitely looks better.];W[in];B[im];W[jn];B[hl];W[gk]
;B[hk]C[Black 51 better at G7 ?

JM: Yes, you're ending up with too many weak groups.  Fortunately, though, white did not cut.]
;W[gj];B[gm];W[kn];B[kr]C[Black 55 better at K1 ?

JM: Probably not.  This threatens to connect underneath and make a few more points along the bottom.]
;W[lc];B[kd];W[ld];B[kc]C[Black 59 better at L15 or L14 ?

JM: Yes, probably L15, you don't want your opponent to get the hane here.]
;W[gc]C[JM: Surprisingly, white doesn't take the chance to hane.]

JM: Maybe a bit better at K14.  This is not a critical decision though]
;W[pg];B[pf];W[og];B[qh];W[pi]C[JM: The game is pretty tough for black now.  White has a very strong wall at D10 and has already played two stones in the corner.  Black will need to make substantial reductions here if he is to win.]

;B[jg];W[jf];B[eg];W[kf]C[JM: This doesn't look very good for white.  Black gets a lot on the left.]

;W[ai];B[ji];W[ij];B[jj];W[ik];B[kh]C[Black 129 better at K9 ?

JM: No, you need this connection and it puts pressure on the white stones.]
;W[jl];B[jm]C[Black 131 better at N13 ?

JM: N13 is huge, if your D6 stones live.];W[kl];B[km];W[mg]
;B[lm];W[kj];B[ll]C[Black 137 aji-keshi ?

JM: Probably not.  You don't want white to be able to push you here and make the O10 area into territory.  You just need to be careful of your E14 stones.]
;W[kk];B[mh];W[mf];B[of];W[nh];B[mi];W[mj];B[nj]C[Black 145 better at O11 ?

JM: I'm not sure, but I don't think so.  Since white plays N9 next, you still should get O11.  This way, however, you get O11 without white playing O10, which is helpful.]

JM: There are very few potential kos on the board, so it doesn't look like this is terribly bad.  It's only 1 point, but it could probably be played now or later without much difference.]

;W[il];B[mm];W[aq];B[en];W[fn]C[White wins by 7.5 points

JM: White's margin of victory could have been overcome either by eliminating the territory at O10 (caused in large part by the mis-read you mentioned) or by keeping the stones at D9.  The stones at D9 could have been kept if the initial mistake at J3 had not been made.

On the other hand, White's mistake of letting the G14 stones be cut off was the only reason that black was able to remain in the game.]
