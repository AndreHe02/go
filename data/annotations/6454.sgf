C[Hi, I played white in this game. I always feel like I make at least decent moves. However, if the score ends up nearly even in the end, then I am definitely making bad high kyu type moves. Please let me know where I could have done better moves, and perhaps throw in some variations. Also, please let me know any general weaknesses that I have. Also, I would like to know when to use the correct joseki, and how to punish my opponent for responding incorrectly. Thanks!

Hi, I'm Litost, 6k on KGS, and I'll be your reviewer. Feel free to contact me by email or on KGS, if you have any questions regarding this review.

I found this game very interesting, of quite a high level (absolutely nothing comparable to an expected 16k game!). You have demonstrated a very good go sense, and also a nice knowledge of good shape. However, you sometimes play "slow" moves (either missing big points, or playing not-severe-enough moves), and "fast" moves (lacking reading depth).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
(;W[cd]C[Here, I think that D17 would be a better direction, working efficiently with your D4 stone (see variation).]
;B[ec];W[gc];B[de]C[With this move, Black wants to build some influence, forcing White on the left side. White can pursue with the peaceful C15 (your move) or contest black's intention with D16.]
;W[ce]
(;B[dd]C[Black D16 diverges from the joseki (see variation). Black stones look slightly heavy to me.]
;W[cg]LB[cc:A][df:B]C[White's choice is not easy to make here; though your move looks fine to me, I would also consider White C17, which takes the corner (Black gaining influence in exchange) or White D14, which pushes towards the center, gaining some territory before acting at the top side. See variations.]

(;B[cc]C[Black makes shape at the top. This is a good move.]
;W[bc];B[cb];W[jc]C[Nice move. This is an important point, helping the G17 stone and aiming at approaching the corner.]
;B[bb];W[bd]LB[mc:D][qn:C][po:B][fq:E][jq:A]C[This move is slow. Not only does it give White a bad shape, but it also has no significant on black's shape at the top.

I think it's better to tenuki here, and take a bigger point (for instance A, B, C, D or E).]
;B[fd]C[This move makes Black overconcentrated, and induces White G16, reinforcing the shape at the top. Black is helping White, here.]
;W[nc]LB[mc:B][gd:A]TR[lc]C[This move, I think, is a mistake.

At first sight, the idea behind O17 is excellent: combine an extension with an attacking move, thus maximizing the utility of O17.

However, White's shape is very thin at the top, and O17 invites black to make the splitting attack at M17. Black would legitimately expect to make huge profit, either capturing the top, or making O17 run towards the center and securing territory at the right during the chase.

Here, as White, I would choose either A or B.];B[lc]C[Black courageously attacks.]

(;W[ke]C[Responding to M17 is not an easy task. The solution you chose certainly makes sense. I have shown another possible variation.]
;B[md];W[nd];B[ne]
(;W[qc]C[Excellent decision. Indeed, the cut at N5 does not seem to work (see variation).]
;B[pc]C[This looks like the wrong direction to me. Black R16 gives more power to take the left side. See variation.]

(;W[pb];B[qd]C[Black decides that the right side is better; good decision.]
;W[rb];B[rd]C[This move looks slow for Black. A play around Q10 looks powerful.]
;W[qj]TR[nc][nd]C[Excellent timing by White. However, I think that playing around Q10, one line higher, is better, because more influence-oriented.]
;B[qh];W[po]C[A light play, maybe too thin, though. One could expect Black to pincer in a splitting attack, then chase Q4 to the left, making profit at the bottom side. See variation.]

(;B[qo]C[This choice by Black seems to favor White, since White will make shape following the joseki.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pn]C[Now White has a much better shape.];B[mq]
;W[gq]C[Excellent timing. Also, this move induces an approach by Black around C6, which could then be pincered, playing a good extension with the C13 stone.]
;B[cq];W[cp]C[That is the good direction, White building a moyo.]
;B[bq]C[Very strange move by Black.];W[dq];B[bp];W[bo];B[co]
;W[bn];B[dr];W[er]
(;B[cr]C[C2 is doubtful, I think that Black should prefer C1, making shape. See variation.]
;W[do]C[This is quite a complex situation, I do not know whether White can kill Black directly - see variation.]

(;B[ar];W[ap];B[aq]C[Big mistake by Black, which loses the corner.]
;W[bs];B[ao];W[bm]TR[co]C[B7 is inaccurate, it is much better to remove the aji of C5, by capturing the stone immediately.

Of course, with B7 black cannot escape without being caught in a geta, but the bad aji still remains.]
;B[fr];W[es];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp]
(;W[dj]TR[fp][fq][fr]C[This move is too conservative, I think: territory should be made as a result of attacking, not for territory itself.

Consider the three marked Black stones; if reinforced, they can give Black formidable thickness to take territory at the bottom. However, if attacked, you can chase them from the center, securing your territory on the right side.

See an example variation that develops the idea.];B[en]C[Excellent decision by Black, who reduces White's moyo while expanding his own.]
;W[dn];B[el];W[dm];B[em];W[jp]C[Good thinking, White can still make something here before Black starts using his thickness.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[ck]
(;W[bk]C[Why bend? Simply cut. I don't think Black can make much damage, see variation.]
;B[dk];W[cj];B[ej]C[Black prevents White from getting to the center, but in this case this is too slow, because White can make sabaki at the bottom and try to spoil Black's moyo.]

(;W[jm]C[Good move, but also keep in mind that the F4 group can still be cut, and that it has no eyes (though it is, in reality, hardly killable). You may use that aji in your sabaki.]
;B[hm];W[ho];B[gn];W[ik];B[hk];W[ij];B[hj]
(;W[oh]C[You have gotten a very interesting result with your variation, forming a moyo. However, I think that N5, capping at the bottom, is probably better than P12, which creates a weakness around Q11. See variation.]
;B[mo]C[Black takes logically the big point, penetrating your moyo.]

;B[lh];W[lg];B[lj];W[mg];B[qk]C[Hard to defend against this good move by Black.]
;W[rk];B[ok];W[ql];B[mk]C[Black ends in gote, but has annihilated White's moyo.]
