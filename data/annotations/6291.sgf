AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

My name is peter from Germany.
I am only a shodan, so please don't expect true suggestions. Please take the comment as a possible course.

I hope you will enjoy.

I prefix my comments wit g4:



ljjrhk [?\]: good game];W[dd]C[japanet: yes];B[pp];W[qn];B[qo]
C[g4: Attaching means strengthening. This is not what black wants.]
;W[pn];B[rn]C[I don't really know how to repond to this... but as O4 is the normal move, then I played P4.

g4: This is ok.];W[op];B[pq]C[g4: Should by at P3, threatening to cutat P5.]
;W[po];B[rp];W[qj];B[oq];W[np];B[rl]C[g4: Too low];W[fq]C[g4: I would like to play R8 to keep the stones connected.]
;B[iq];W[fo]C[I don't know joseki with that pincer...

g4: Basically they look very similar. You can invade or play this move or play a double kakari at C6 or D6. It's just a matter of taste.]
;B[lq]C[g4: Black should first strengthen the corner stone with D6 or perhaps C6.]
;W[dn]C[I think Black should have played D6...
So I surrond the corner to make outside strenght.

g4: Good!];B[co];W[cn];B[bo];W[bn]C[g4: Very good!];B[dr];W[eq]
C[I'm not sure this move is good, the shape seems weird, no ?

g4: I don't see the sense of this move. It doesn't cover the weak point of E5 and it may not be sente.]
;B[dq];W[dj]C[g4: Good];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[ci]C[I thought about C10, but it's too close from my wall and I prefer outside influence, so...]
;W[di];B[cj];W[ch];B[bh];W[dh];B[bg];W[be]C[To lock my corner, but maybe a little slow ?

g4: This seems dangerous to me. The corner is safe now. But what would you do if black plays D9 now? And if you play E9 black E8?]
;B[de];W[ed];B[qg]C[g4: This is not urgent. The corner is still open.]
;W[ck]C[g4: Good];B[bk]C[Maybe it was not the best way to attack the black group...]
;W[cl];B[ai]C[Black is alive and out to the center, it seems it's a bad result for black, no ?

g4: First Black is not clearly alive. see var. But if you block his way into the center with F13 i.e., black has to add another move to live. And this result is good for white.]

(;W[jp]C[g4: Nice.];B[lo]C[g4: Good fighting spirit.];W[nq]
LB[lp:A]C[g4: This move is risky. White might come under attack. I would perhaps prefer K3 taking territory and threatening the connection at A]
;B[jq]C[g4: As black I had tried O6 first.];W[kp];B[lp];W[kq]
C[g4: I would wait with this move. I like K7 to get into the center fast.]
;B[kr];W[mr]C[g4: I would wait with this move. Perhaps you want to cut there later.]
;B[lr];W[ip];B[hq];W[gr]LB[pl:C][nn:B][ho:A]C[g4: This seems as white wants to kill the black group . This seems not possible. White has some weak points at A, B, C. Compare this result with the simple magari at K3.]
;B[hp];W[jn];B[hn];W[in];B[go];W[fn];B[hm];W[jl]C[This kind of fighting is my weakness (I was told so), so any advice is welcome ;)

g4: This fight would be more easy if your center group had been connected. Now you have to take care of it.]
;B[mq]C[g4: Bad move, forcing white to weaken the corner.];W[nr]
C[g4: Why not P2?];B[pl];W[nn];B[ko]C[g4: It is important to stay ahead in the center, so I would prefer M7. This also separates the white groups.]
;W[hk]C[g4: I would play M7 to connect the goup virtually.]
;B[em];W[do]C[g4: Black shows good fighting spirit. Playing defensive moves might be not enough. There is a weakness at D9 now.]
;B[fm];W[ek];B[fk];W[gl]C[g4: Good! Fight back.];B[gm];W[fl]
;B[nl]C[g4: This  is very dangerous.];W[lm]C[I think the kosumi at N7 is better, black can cut now !!

g4: Yes I think so too.];B[im];W[jm];B[hl];W[ik];B[gk];W[el]
;B[gi]C[g4: This seems unnecessary. Cutting though N6 should win the game for Black.]
;W[fg]C[g4: Ok];B[gg];W[ff];B[bf]C[g4: Black has to add a move to defend. But I think it is better to scrifice the three stones and cut at N6 instead.]
;W[fj];B[gj];W[fh];B[gh];W[gf];B[hf];W[he];B[if];W[ie];B[ih]
;W[jf];B[jg];W[kf];B[jd];W[je];B[kd];W[kg];B[kh];W[ji];B[ii]
;W[jh];B[jj];W[ig];B[hg];W[ki]C[g4: J10 kills instead.];B[ij]
;W[kj];B[jk]
(;W[il]C[g4: You can't get everything. You should give 2 stones, connect your groups and use your strngth at the top to attack. (see var)]
;B[kk];W[ll];B[lk];W[mk];B[ml]C[g4: Black has to live. He has no time for this.]
;W[mj];B[lj]C[This semeai is very dangerous for me...

g4: No more I think.];W[mi]C[g4: Yes!];B[li];W[lh];B[mh];W[nh]
;B[mg];W[ng];B[mf];W[nf]C[g4: P11 wins the semeai for sure.]
;B[le];W[mm]C[I need to connect first, and then quickly kill the cutting black stones (5 liberties, no?)

g4: Good.];B[nm];W[mo];B[ni];W[nj];B[oi];W[oj];B[pi];W[pj];B[qi]
;W[kl];B[ln];W[mn];B[jo];W[io]C[These moves seems bad for black, losing liberties...]
;B[gq];W[fr];B[lg];W[kh];B[id];W[hd];B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[gb]
;B[nd]C[g4: This is not enough. You might be able to enter R16.]
;W[qc]C[g4: This should not work. With R16 black covers his aji at Q14.]
;B[pc]C[g4: I would block at R16.]
(;W[pb]C[g4: See vars for other possibilities.]
(;B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[sd];W[nb]C[Is there a way for black to kill ?

g4: No not now.];B[ob];W[oc];B[nc];W[oa]C[Alive, ouff !];B[mb]
;W[sb];B[od];W[ob];B[cc];W[bc];B[cd];W[bd];B[bl];W[bm];B[dm]
;W[cm];B[ep];W[fp]C[To nice for white, helping moves no ?];B[eo]
;W[en];B[hr];W[hs];B[or];W[ho];B[is];W[jr];B[pm];W[gp];B[mp]

;W[on];B[qm];W[fi];B[oo];W[no];B[kn];W[ir];B[er];W[ao]C[I think black should have resign earlier, but White was is danger in this fight.

Thank you for your comments !])
