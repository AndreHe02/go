RE[B+Resign]

C[Hello!
This game was pretty even till my opponent's last assault on my territory.
Please point out my mistakes.
Please focus more on strategy. Big tactical errors I've already found :(((

Thank you

JM: Tomaz, thank you for the opportunity to review your game.  It was a very exciting match, which both sides had chances to win.  I've done my best to point out the areas that struck me as significant for one reason or another.  All of my comments are preceded with 'JM:'  I am a 1kyu on IGS, so please take everything I say with a grain of salt.  Only professionals can definitively say what the best move in any position is.

In the opening, I felt white was far too greedy.  The touching moves in the lower left, as well as the slow move of R8 demonstrate an over-eagerness to secure points.  In the end, this attempt by white to make secure territory left black with even more points than white made.

The middle game centerred around the large fight for the life of black's F6 group.  Here I felt white missed opportunities to secure a win, but it is quite possible I overlooked something.

In the end, a small endgame blunder by white cost him the game, as the upper right group died.  In accordance with your request, I tried to make as many comments as possible on the larger issues, rather than the tactical, fighting ones.]

C[JM: D16 is unorthodox, and rather awkward.  Before D16, the white shape has a weakness at E17, so white's next move in this joseki is almost always to fix this.  However, the two traditional move of B18 and E18 do this much more effectively, because they both eliminate black from playing B18 in sente.  D16 just provokes C15, which is good shape for black.]
;B[cf];W[id]C[JM: If you plan to approach the top right, as happened in the game, this may be better poisitioned at J17.]
;B[bb];W[oc]C[What should I play instead of kakari?
Is this kakari correct? Maybe it should be played farther from black's stone to maximize left top thickness?

JM: This kakari is OK, provided that you realize its proper role in the developing sequence, which I don't think happened.  Playing P17 should make black reluctant to pincer, because white can so easily split his groups.  Playing further away from black's stone would be an example of trying too hard to secure points.  The proverb says that thickness should not be used to make points, but to attack a weak group.]
;B[mc]C[JM: Black obliges and pincers];W[qc]C[JM: This needs to be at P15.  Your goal must be to keep N17 weak.]
;B[rc];W[pd];B[qe];W[pe]C[JM: This needs to be at R18.  The difference between W and B playing there is too big.]
;B[qb];W[md]C[JM: The goal was to attack N17.  However, the proverb says "Don't touch a weak stone."  Play either L17 or N15/14 to force the stone to run out.]
;B[kc];W[lc]C[JM: AHH! touching twice! See previous comment.]

;B[nc];W[pf];B[nf];W[qf];B[lf];W[jc]C[I do not know if I should be satisfied with the result of this fight?

JM: Definitely not.  Black finishes with very solid groups, well defined territory, and N13, which dominates the center.  White is left with a weaker Q14 group, and little consolation.]
;B[mg];W[re]C[Obvious mistake. S14 was sente

JM: S14 wasn't even really sente, since R17 is in atari.];B[rd]
;W[rf];B[pc];W[od]C[JM: P16 is way too small at this point.]
;B[ob];W[pj]C[How far and how high should I develop from this wall?

JM: I think R10 may have been better, just because N13 is so powerful.  The distance is good though.]
;B[qn]C[JM: Another reason why Q10 might be better at R10.]
;W[ql]C[JM: Painful, and too small.  This is another example of being too greedy to secure territory.  Better to develop the D4 stone.]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[cl];W[cm]C[JM: C7 and the upcoming E3 just make black stronger.  I think the most important lesson you can take from this game is to avoid touching your opponents stones so much.  Whenever you do so, it's likely an example of being too greedy.]
;B[dl];W[eq];B[fp];W[iq];B[kq];W[io];B[fn];W[em]C[JM: Good.  It's important not to get sealed in.]
;B[gm];W[el];B[di];W[kp];B[lq];W[lp];B[mq];W[mp];B[np];W[no]
C[JM: Black gets to crawl along the third, and now the fourth line, while white makes little in the centre.  White should not be happy with this.]
;B[op];W[oo];B[po];W[im];B[gk];W[gl]C[JM: This is rather vulgar.]

(;W[hf]C[JM: Just like the cross-cut situation in the top right, you should not be content with this result.  In both cases, Black finishes with captures that make his groups very powerful.  Playing L11 for white looks much better. (see variation)]

[ro][rp][rq][rr][rs][sa][sb][sc][so][sp][sq][sr][ss]C[JM: Black saves his last group.  At this point, it would be a good time to count.

B: LR=32+UR=15+UL=25+5caputres=77
W:UL=20+R=17+LL=26+Center=13+ 4captures+6.5komi=86.5

This is an optimistic count for white.  The LL and UL both were reduced substantially from these markings.  It's still close, but both sides should play carefully.]

C[JM: Since F8 has already been saved, it would be better to play B6 and let the two stones (E7/8) go.]

;B[bj];W[ei];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[rm];B[rn];W[ed]C[JM: After playing S7, white should continue the natural, sente sequence with T6, before playing here.  In the end, this omission led to white's downfall. :-(]
