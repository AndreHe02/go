AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Jan:
Hi reviewer,

My name is Jan and I played black as "Peatman" in this game.
It was played on 23-nov-2007 on IGS. I had a 3 stones handicap. I won, but only by 10 stones. One usually does not take any risk when playing a handicap-game and plays defensively but I don't have the feeling I did. (at least not on purpose). So the difference (20 points) is what makes me 12k+ and takatake 9k. How to become a 9k and/or be more agressive?

Some instances I recognized myself. Are there more instances in wich I could have played better?


Hey Jan,
I'm Max, a 6kyu from GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.

I'll prefix all my comments in the main game line with "Max-" and try to address all the questions you added.

I'll also give a summary of the review at the end of the game.]
;W[pq];B[po];W[pl];B[no];W[mq]LB[qq:A]C[Jan:
I have the feeling this extension should be at O3 and is too far. Is this true and how should I profit from this? For a while I was thinking about P3, but was afraid of P4. and a better idea seemed to me to...

-Max
N3 is one joseki variation. White makes good shape with a 2-space extension on the third line.

Blacks should be aiming at strengthening his Q5 group and then counter-attacking the Q8 pincer stone. "A" shows one way to do this.]
(;B[qm]LB[pl:2][pq:1]C[Jan:
.. attack the other (weaker) side and make some kind of base.

-Max
This is a classic mistake, black is touching a weak stone.

Let's look at the situation before black moves: White's 1 group is pretty much settled, while his 2 group is still unsecure and without a base.

Black's plan here should be to strengthen himself against white's already secure 1 group so he can counter-attack the weaker 2 group.

Another thing you should realize is that this move is not an attack. In fact it is pretty much the opposite. To attack, black would have to play a move around Q11, depriving the white Q8 stone of the ability to make an extension and make a base. By exchanging R7 with R8 you are only making the Q8 stone stronger. Before the exchange it was a single stone with 4 liberties. After the exchange Q8 and R8 form an "iron pillar", which is considered good shape and its liberties have increased to 5.

Remember:
"Don't touch weak stones"];W[ql];B[pm]LB[qh:A]C[jan:
Nice shape, I think, but it gives him the opportunity to extend towards Q16

Max-
White should extend to "A" now, see variation.]
(;W[qf]LB[pi:A]C[Max-
R14 is too far, as the Q8 stones are still without a base. Black can pincer here, see variation "A".]
(;B[pf]C[Jan:
Backing off at O16 or O17 would grant him too much territory so I chose for agression.

Was around q12 a better option? Playing in between his two weak groups or would this be too aggressive?


Max-
O16 would be passive, Q12 or a similar high pincer would have been the better option.

This Q14 is the same mistake you made with R7. By touching the opponents stones you are strengthening them and helping him make a base.

Remember:
"Don't touch weak stones"];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd]LB[pe:A]TR[pl]
[ql]C[Jan:
Until now the standard joseki. White R11 and Black O16 would finish it.
I did not expect to be out of trouble in this corner.
It's my impression that the stronger players are, the more they tend to deviate from joseki. Probably to piss us beginners off. ;-) And they have every right to do so.

I expected some kind of invasion around  N16 before black coulkd play O16. Looking at it now the joseki-extension by white does not seem that nescessary, so he can tenuki, leaving aji around Q15.




Max-
Let me quickly address your statement about joseki. Usually the stronger you get at go, the more joseki you encounter and thereby learn. This doesn't mean that opponnents that are stronger than you will know all the joseki that you know.

Joseki should act as a guideline, they are not the be-all-end-all wisdom that some people take them to be. They lead to a locally fair result, but this may very well be advantagous to one side when the whole board is taken into account.

This means that there are cases when deviating from joseki is a better choice than playing the locally fair line. However, before you reach around middle/low-SDK levels almost all cases of joseki deviation stem from not knowing the correct line and not from concious choices because the joseki line isn't the most advantagous.

Especially when playing on WBaduk or other non-mainly western servers you will see most kyu players make serious joseki mistakes, mainly because they just don't know better.

You are right insofar as there is aji left here, but not so much Q15 for white (see variation "A") as there is in the cut at R13 for black that might cause white some trouble, which is why he usually plays a move around R12 to protect against it.]
(;W[qp]
(;B[qo]LB[qo:A][oq:B]C[Jan:
Was this too submissive? P3 Would be more agressive, but would it work? Probably better for black. See varation.

Max-
Yes, this is submissive. R5 isn't doing much, you are only securing one eye at the edge.

There are many possibilities, but in my opinion P8 would have been best, see variation.]
;W[rd]
(;B[og]C[Jan:
Attacks his mojo and makes my stones stronger (less vulnerable for cutting by making a more wall-like structure against the center.)

Max-
You are confusing moyo with territory. White has some potential on the right, but what you must realize is that defending the corner is much larger, not only in terms of points but also in terms of relative group strength, see variation.]
;W[ph];B[rc];W[pe];B[oe];W[od]C[Jan:
Aha! Ok. So now I have to save the corner group first. preferably by attacking his stones or his mojo.

Max-
The standard way of defending against this cut is by giving atari at O16, see variation.]
(;B[pc]LB[pb:B][pc:A]C[Jan:
Too defensive still?
Perhaps Q18 would have made better shape. See variation.
Better options for attack? P17 but that would incite the move he would make anyway.

Max-
The problem with this move is that it is making very bad shape. The Q17,Q16 and R16 stones form an empty triangle which can turn into a big tactical liability. Giving atari at O16 would have been better.]
;W[nd]C[Max-
This is why giving atari at O16 first is a must.];B[oh];W[pi]
;B[lf]C[Max-
This doesn't look direct enough. N15 would have been better, putting more pressure on the white O16 stones.]
;W[re]
(;B[qb]LB[nb:B][qb:A]C[Jan:
Maybe this was too defensive. I said I should attack his stones and thus secure my cornergroup but If that's wahat I wanted I should have played something like O18. I think this would have been better for black. See variations.

Max-
Again, the strongest attack here would be a move that stops white from making a base. I think M17 works for black, see variation.]
;W[ob];B[oc];W[nc];B[pb];W[ke];B[nb]C[Max-
This is sooo slow. The corner is already alive, black doesnt need the P18 eye, and it isn't really hurting white as he can just make a base by extending on the top.]
;W[mb];B[hc]C[Max-
By playing O18 and then playing tenuki black has helped white make exellent shape.]
;W[na];B[le];W[kf];B[ld];W[kd]

I think I should have pushed along at M17, splitting his groups.

Max-

Good for white.];B[lh];W[cf]
(;B[df]C[Max-
This response is usually only used by black if he wants to build some sort of moyo towards the top/right. It is helping white make good shape.

Maybe a pincer is better, see variation.];W[cc]
(;B[dc]C[Max-
This is blocking from the wrong side, what does black want with thickness facing towards the right, where white already has a strong group ? The few points you get in conjunction with H17 is not enough.

You usually want to use thickness to attack in some way. One way of doing this is by facing the thickness towards an open area and creating a moyo, forcing the opponent to invade and fight. Facing it towards a safe group defeats the purpose.

Remember:
"Block on the wider side"

;W[cg];B[cb];W[bb]
(;B[cl]C[Max-
This is a loose move. What is this stone doing? See variations.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[ca];B[ff]LB[de:A]C[Jan:

Too concerned about group "A"? I'm most probably alive here and in the lower left corner there is more to gain.

Max-
Yes. If you are going to help the A group you should peep at K17 to strenghten it in sente.

If you don't want to peep at K17 the shape move to stregthen the A group would be E12, keeping white low and gaining center influence.]
;W[fq]C[Jan:
And white thought that too. Why didn't I?

Max-
Black should think long and hard about what he wants here. I think this might be the right opportunity to play F4, as that would make use of the formerly lost C8 stone and black could aim at building a center moyo.]
(;B[iq]C[Jan:
Was this invasion a good idea, or was I too jealous of his bottom mojo?

Max-
Well, what is black gaining here? If white jumps into the corner he will get the corner points and black will get thickness towards the bottom, which is small because of the secure N3 group.

Also, white might jump out to F5, see variation.]

Provoking black into attacking the "A" group is not a good idea.]
;B[ig];W[if];B[jj]C[Max-

;W[hf]LB[ka:F][ah:A][oi:E][rl:C][rp:D][lq:B]C[Max-

For endgame, the rule of thumb is:
double-sente first
sente second
reverse-sente next (these are moves that are gote, but would be sente for your opponent)
gote last

Let's classify the non-trivial moves that are left:
double-sente: B
sente: A
reverse-sente: F
gote: C,D,E

A lower class move might be better if it was much larger than a higher class one, but in most cases this sequence will result in good endgame play.

So I think black should play B first, then A, then F, and only then the gote moves starting with the largest C (which also makes D sente...)]
;B[jg]C[Jan:
Small.

Yes, 1 point in gote.]

...but it didn't.
Black wins by 10.0 points.

Max-
Actually you both forgot to count the points around J7, so black wins by 3.

While there weren't many serious misreads (except for the top right dying), you do tend to make some serious tactical and strategical mistakes.

In the opening you must work on the concepts of attacking. Not only which groups to attack and why, but you must work on the actual technique as well. Your main weakness is that you tend to touch weak stones (moves 9,13,51). This should be avoided if in any way possible. Attacking is done by surrounding enemy stones and putting pressure on them to make eyes, thereby forcing them to run, not by touching or shoulder hitting.

You should also think about the relative value of moves. Is making one eye important, or is running away maybe a better choice (move 19)? Hane for good shape, or rather cut and weaken your enemy (move 47)?

Another mistake I noticed is the use of thickness. Block to the wider side, don't use thickness to make territory, knowing and using these basics will easily make you a stronger player. Maybe watch some dan games on KGS and how they use thickness if you want to get a feel for it.

In the middle game I think your biggest weakness is not haneing when touched ; ). But seriously, I did notice a tendancy to do anything but hane when your opponent touched your stones, the hane should be the first thing you think of and your most common response. It takes one liberty from the opposing stone, it takes one direction for the stones to expand and it usually applies more pressure. Some moves to review this would be 111, 119 and 133.

Your endgame looks okay, sticking to the rules I pointed out at move 182 will be an easy way to become a bit stronger.

Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this review and will take one or two ideas from it. If you have any questions don't hesitate to write back!

All the best,
