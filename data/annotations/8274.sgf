C[Hi,

I played White and lost by some points in the end. My questions:
- What could I have done better in the fuseki?
- Would there be a way to turn this around in the endgame?
- Of course I appreciate pointers to other obvious mistakes.

Thanks!


Hey Stefan,
I'm Max, a 6kyu from Berlin, Germany.

I will add alternatives by marking your game move with A and showing alternatives with the following letters.

I will prefix all my comments in the main game line with "Max-" and try to address all the questions you added.

I'll also give a summary of the review at the end of the game.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[oc]LB[qi:B][pj:C][qj:A]
(;W[qj]C[Max- A good move, limiting the shimari's potential and somewhat working with white's 4-4 on the bottom, though I prefer one of the two alternatives.]
;B[jp]LB[dj:A][cn:B]
(;W[dj]C[Max- D10 works well with D16, but this move looks a little to slow/passive to me. See C6 alternative.]
;B[jc]LB[fc:C][qg:A][cn:B]
(;W[qg]C[Max- A slow move. This is purely a point move that limits the shimari's potential. R10 is in no danger and doesn't need to be defended. See alternatives.]
;B[np]LB[pn:A][nq:B]
(;W[pn]C[I guess there was nothing special up to here.

Max- Although Q6 works well for white, she missed an opportunity for getting the better part of this exchange, see alternative.]
;B[dl]LB[dg:A][cq:B]
(;W[dg]C[Max- Too passive, black is expanding his potential at the bottom left nicely and white is not getting enough in return. The three high stones at the top do not make good shape.]
;B[fc]C[Max- White's three stones at the top have been effectively neutralized. C3 would have been even better for B though, as the top white stones' potential is limited anyway.]
;W[lq]LB[lp:B][mq:A]C[Max- The wrong direction. If white wants to destroy black's potential C3 invasion would be easiest. White is basically offering a stone to be attacked and not gaining anything in return.]
(;B[mq]C[Max- A horrible blunder by black];W[lp];B[nn]LB[ln:B]
[fp:A]
(;W[fp]C[In retrospection this seems dubious to me. I create a weak group and leave it to create another. Should I have continued with m6 or so?

Max- Yes, M6 is urgent for both.];B[eq];W[fq];B[iq];W[do];B[co]
LB[dn:B][ep:A]
(;W[ep];B[dq];W[fn]C[Max- Bad shape, see alternative];B[jn]
;W[ln];B[lr]LB[mp:A][kr:B]
(;W[mp]C[I think it would have been more consistent to try l2, and to isolate the black k4 stones.

Max- Yes, L2 is urgent, seperating black and completely destroying the K4 group's base]
;B[nr];W[ll]C[At least I get to jump out.

Max- This is very bad for white. Black is connected and strong everywhere, whereas white has the weak M4 and F4 groups to worry about. Both have bad shape and can be attacked by one seperating group. Black plays K8 to win the game.]
(;B[kq]C[Now I don't have a base and he's connected and strong.]
;W[mn];B[on];W[oq];B[nq]LB[ol:A][dn:B]
(;W[ol]C[His next move shows this is too loose. q8?

Max- Besides being too loose as you noted, this is the wrong direction. The right is not important, it's only points. White needs to worry about both of his weak groups and try to defend them as quickly as possible. See alternative.]
;B[pm];W[qn];B[om]LB[nl:A][dn:C][or:B]C[Max- Now white's bottom right is also getting weak. The P8 stone is of no importance, white needs to start defending all her weak groups.]

(;W[rr]C[Max- Very small, D6 is urgent.];B[or]LB[pl:A][qm:B]
(;W[pl]C[Is r7 better here?

Max- Perhaps, see alternative];B[qm];W[rn];B[rm];W[db]C[Max- Weak groups have priority to points]
;B[fe];W[hc]C[Max- White is invading where there are hardly any points to destroy. Simply playing P15 or K15 to limit black's potential would be better alternatives.]
;B[id];W[fb];B[hd];W[gc];B[gd];W[ec];B[dn];W[fl]LB[ek:A][eo:B]
(;B[ek]C[This shows I make it too easy for him. Two weak groups on the bottom to chase for him.

Max- Exactly, this has been neglected far too long. Taking at E5 would have been even better for black, see variation.]

C[I use my thickness to make territory here and make him stronger by the way. How could I have played this better?

Max- White is not making territory as black has undercut her with S7. She is overconcentrated on the right and is in danger of being cut again at K9.]
;B[mg]LB[ih:B][mh:A]
(;W[mh]C[Max- Answering here is just helping black make more points. White has nothing to defend, there are no points for her here.]

Summary
In general I would say you played quite well, your reading and tactics seem sound enough. The main thing you need to work at the moment is your strategic analysis.

In fuseki, don't concentrate on making or taking points, instead focus on the relative strength of positions and how strength/influence is developing. Always ask yourself "where are there weak groups?" first, before considering any alternative moves.

In the mid-game, pay closer attention to which groups can be cut and which have no base and/or bad shape. Keeping your own groups strong while hurting the opponents' weakish ones should always be your top priority. Don't worry about points as much, instead worry about eye space and staying connected.

In the end-game, you should always keep an eye out for the obvious sente moves, which are usually on the 2nd and 1st line. Try to get as many as those before your opponnent and limit gote moves to when you are making a lot of points and/or you are forestalling an opponnent's large sente move.

I hope you enjoyed this review and could take one or two ideas from it. Let me know if there is anything you are in disagreement about or if you have any questions!

All the best,
