(;B[di]C[D11 is unusual.
It is too far to stabilize correctly C14 (invasion in C12 latter in the game) and too close to be a good extension for fast development.

if you want to stabilize, you should choose the joseki B16 or C11.
if you want a fast development, you should chosse D10.

See variations.];W[jc]C[joseki]

It does not protect the corner, does not build influence, and does not attack R14.
