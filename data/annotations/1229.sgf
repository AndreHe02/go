C[Dear Felipe,

Attached is my review of your game. I enjoyed reviewing this game
because I was able to suggest my favorite kind of moves, big ones! In
fact, I often get into trouble because I make a big move when I urgently
need to make a move to save a group or protect a territory. By big move,
I mean a move that maps a big moyo, grabs a big territory or threatens
to make a big attack on your opponent. Try to make a big move whenever
you don't really need to make a defensive play.

In this game both white and black make small gote responses to their
opponents moves or grab a few points of territory when a few 10's of
points are at issue elsewhere. White does this more than black and that
is why he loses.

For more on this subject, get any go book that discusses moyo's,
influence, thickness, reducing moves, or attack and defense. Of course,
it is important to also know when not to make a big move. For this you
need to study life and death, forcing moves, tesuji, and maybe even
joseki. Well, I guess you can't learn everything at once! :)

I hope that you find my comments understandable and that they add
something to your understanding of the game.

The game move is more like a reducing move and can be saved until black is just about ready to solidify his moyo.]
;B[hc];W[cf];B[cd];W[cj]C[The overall game is pretty even at this point. Black has smaller but tighter territory. White has a very large, but very open sphere of influence.]
;B[fq];W[cm]
(;B[dq]LB[cq:A]C[I like the move at A better here. A joseki is added as an alternate here.]

;W[ro];B[rq];W[qn];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[ns]C[This is an endgame move. Making it now gives white the initiative.]
;W[mm]LB[pj:A][qi:B][nj:C][mj:D][ep:E][oe:F][mc:G][fd:H][ef:I]
[hq:J][eo:K][hd:L][ff:M][fc:N]C[This is overconcentrated (too close to white's wall) especially with the A stone already present. If white really wants to play in this area, B-D would be better, giving more potential territory and leading to more attacking chances against black. Other moves to consider would be E-N.]
;B[qj];W[qk];B[qi];W[ic]LB[fd:A][mc:B][oe:C][ff:D]C[This move ends up making black strengthen himself in the upper left and doesn't really add to white security. I would play b-d instead.]

;B[lh];W[eq]C[This move turns out better for white than I would have thought at first.]

(;B[er]C[I would consider the alternate line of play here for black.]

;W[mo]LB[gi:A][jg:B][hg:C]C[This is not white's biggest move. It protects white's small, overconcetrated territory. White needs grab as much of his big left side moyo as he can get. A will help do that. B is a move to aim toward to capture black's C stone on a large scale.]
;B[lr];W[lp]C[These are all pretty much endgame plays. They are not important at this point. White, in particular, needs to make some big plays.]
;B[kp];W[ln];B[ko];W[km];B[kr];W[ms]LB[ps:A][pr:B]C[It becomes apparent that black should have responded to this move with A or B. This was one of the few truly sente moves in the last several moves on this side.]
;B[hj]C[This is the kind of big move that white needed to make. Black is well ahead now. White will be forced to scramble to salvage as much of the left side as he can get while black takes a big bite out of the center.]
;W[pr]C[This capture keeps the score from being too lopsided.]
;B[qr];W[os];B[rs];W[sr]C[Good job of hitting the vital point!]
;B[eh]LB[ej:A]C[This move is probably bigger than white's last one. In retrospect, white should probably have left the final corner capture for later and played somewhere over here instead. Black's placement might be better at A, but the reducing idea is right.]
;W[dh];B[eg]LB[ej:A]C[Now I really do like A better, but black can't really go to far wrong here.]
