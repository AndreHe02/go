C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for
reviewing this game.  I''ve been doing quite a bit of thinking about
what I might be doing wrong, since I've been losing so frequently
lately.  It seems as though no matter what I try, I'm unable to prevent
my opponent from getting a large moyo.  And if I try something like a
3-3 invasion (as in this game) or a wariachi (unfortunately none in this
game), I end up with a weak group and losing territory while I have to
defend something.  (In this game, I didn't have to defend the R3
invasion so much as the territory on the left, which White was able to
weaken.)  I can usually see *after the fact* (either towards the end of
the game or when I review it) if my opponent has gotten a large moyo, or
which of my groups my opponent was able to weaken, but I still can't
figure out where exactly I went wrong to allow this to happen, or, more
importantly, what I should be doing differently to prevent it from
happening in the first place.

I apologise if this isn't the best game
to show exactly what my problems are, but I have so many games to choose
from right now -- I've only won something like 3 out of my last 20
games.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger

mes: I've got a lot of comments for many moves.  The biggest thing I see
in your game to work on is patience and judgement.  Like many players,
you've got a tendency to view things as territory before they really are
and not see fairly easy invasions and reductions.    I challenge you to invade and reduce depper than you think you can in
some games and see what happens.  You'll probably get slaughtered a few
times, but you may be surprised at how easily some groups escape, live
or counterattack.    Along the same lines, love the junction lines between your moyos and
your opponents moyos.  These are where some of the most valuable plays
in the early middle game are to be had.  Look to build up your space and
narrow the opponent's space before doing single purpose defending or
invading.   When the opponent comes into your area, don't focus only on your
territory or the opponents territory -- keep an eye on the balance.  If
letting the opponent dive in and ruin your moyo means you dive in and
ruin his, it's an even trade, and often turns out better for you than
defending every incursion.    Attack, not with the goal of killing, but of making your opponent play
moves on neutral points to live small or escape, while you take profit
or build thickness.

The other big thing I see is that you don't have enough respect for aji.
You are very eager to play out positions to the bitter end, even though
the gains are small and you are eliminating the possibility for
different action that might prove more worthwhile depending on further
moves.

Go is a game of options.  The more options you leave yourself, the
stronger your game will be.
A mark of a strong player is that many sequences are read out but left
unplayed until later.  If you see a cut that doesn't quite work, it's
usually best to leave it alone and make note of some plays nearby that
might threaten to make it work.  Rather than using the threat
immediately to take some small profit, see if you can steer the play
elsewhere to allow you to make a profound double threat.  This is the
mark of a strong player.    The more good aji you leave on the board, the more likely you can
actually implement such plays and make some really spectacular
reversals, the sort of stuff that makes people smack their heads when
they are taking black in a high handicap game.

You can almost always get that small profit later if the game plays out
that you can't exploit the aji.  Be on the lookout for when it becomes
impossible to do anything big with the aji, then make the small profit
play (assuming it is sente, or big enough).

Even if your opponent plays there and elminates both the yose play and
the aji, that's okay as well -- they've spent a move to fix a problem
and you can take profit elsewhere.   
Until the big points are all taken and the fights all through, anything
worth less than 10 poin];B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[ce]C[mes: Note
here -- white is keeping you from establishing a moyo by playing here
before you've finished what will probably be a chinese formation.    Since you say you have trouble with your opponents taking moyos, this is
a move to pay attention to.

OTOH, I'm not sure it's as good a move as playing in the lower right,
especially since it doesn't work with white's existing stone in the
upper right.

You can use this tempo to take the lower right corner. White's most
severe continuations are the taisha and a counter pincer, from which you
can get good results (see variations).]
(;B[ee]LB[fd:B][ed:A][gc:C][cg:D]C[mes: This move here shows poor direction.  A kosumi, or a
simple extension on the upper side is better.   The pincer at D would
also be a good move here.

This move 5 is played in the special situation where black has a
potential moyo on the upper side.  Generally black should have a
position in the upper right, or around the center star point that this
works with to form either territory or an area of influence.   On this board, 5 is definitely a mistake in
direction.];W[dd]LB[ec:A][cc:B][dg:C]C[mes: I don't like this
white move. Pushing into the knight's move is generally bad and should
be done only at great need, or when one intends to cut at A after the
response.

I believe the joseki here are for white to attach at B or mirror the
knight's move at C];B[ed];W[cc];B[db];W[pp]C[mes: I
think this is a white mistake.  As a result of the moves in the upper
left, you have much influence on the upper side.  A move somewhere
between your next kakari and the center star point on the upper side is
actually more urgent than the lower right corner.    If white wants this corner, he should tenuki in response to your capping
play at 5, or better yet, play a lighter kakari (say 6-3, or 6-4)
which you will probably respond to but not pressure, so it can be
treated as something of a strategic kikashi.  Or even just play in the
lower corner at move 4.  Generally playing kakari at move 4 cedes the
third corner to black.];B[nc]LB[nd:A][md:B]C[Fedya: I thought that this move would
work well with the thickness on the left.  After all, they say you're
supposed to use thickness to attack someplace, and then make territory
someplace else.

mes:  A higher approach at A or B would work better.  The natural
contination in this position from your low kakari is the pincer.  Since
white doesn't have a stone around d10, a corner invasion would normally
be called for, but then your thickness is nullified.];W[lc]
C[mes:  In this position, even though the corner is
tempting when white has no stone around Q10, your influence in the upper
left is grounds to attack -- you should jump and counter pincer as in
the b variation.]
(;B[qc];W[qd];B[pc];W[od];B[nb];W[pi]C[mes: White gave you an
opportunity here.  Fearing your nullification of his wall, he has
abandoned the joseki to play q11.  this means you can split off his
pincer stone and attack on a large scale with b, or a leaning push at c.
With the normal joseki, you still have this option, but your cutting
stones are cut off and fighting can turn against you.  Here, with c, you
are completely connected and very strong.  That is quite bad for white.]

(;B[ic]C[Fedya: White didn't play a standard move in the joseki (which
IIRC should be at N15), which should give me a free move.    mes: Well not really.  White departed last move by playing the
extension, and you let him get away with it.  Still, a is not the best
choice here.  White plays this to emphasize the right side when the
pincer stone can take care of itself.  Here it cannot, so you should
take advantage of the aji to cut left by white playing o16 instead of
n15.


Fedya: On the one hand, I like this idea, since it should help me make
territory with the thickness on the left, and I don't White playing
there first.  But on the other hand, it does nothing about the moyo that
White is looking to build on the right.  Or should I have played in the
area of C/D10 instead?

mes: C/D10 is a big extension, but not as big as K3/4, and not as big as
making the cuts in white's formation in the upper right.  Note that you
have a moyo on the upper side, and white has a moyo on the right.

Cutting into white's wall is a form of playing on the junction line.    When two opposing moyos are next to each other, the largest move on the
board is usually a move on the line that separates them -- such a move
reduces one moyo while expanding the other, and is often double sente.
White's next move is one such point (which is why it was a better move
for you than your own 19).  You need to continute in the same vein.]
;W[nd]C[mes:  see the variation at b for the first part of an
explanation why you should not play 'a' yet.]
(;B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qf]C[mes: The hane and connection are small and
should be left to the endgame.  Generally moves like this are only good
this early in the game if they affect the life and death of your group,
or do not eliminate any useful aji.

Here it is aji keshi.  White's wall is now linked to the extension at
q11, so white has nothing to fear on the right side from your potential
cut at b (see variation)]

TB[sb][rb][qb][pb][pa][qa][ra][sa][sc][oa]LB[jp:A][jq:B][cg:C]
C[Fedya: Would it have been better to play something like C8
first before this?  I was thinking for several moves about C8, but never
got around to it.  I decided to play O3 because I was worried about how
much territory White was getting on the right side, and wasn't sure that
C8 would be enough compensation.

mes:  c8 isn't really compensation -- it's merely a big point.  Also,
don't think in terms of white's right side being territory.  There are
lots of ways to invade it yet.

The only part of the right side that is truly territory I have marked
here.  It's about 14 points, and you have almost that much in the
corner.

To answer your specific question, the lower side is more valuable than
the left side.  White has a 3rd line position in the upper left which
lowers the value of development on that side.  On the bottom, both black
and white are on the 4th line, so the area there is worth much more.  So
your kakari is the right decision (You could also extend to A or B).

The left side could be played profitably, but only by exploiting the
weakness of the white stones with a severe attack at
C.];W[pn];B[jp];W[cm];B[gp]C[Fedya: Would it have been better to play at C5 instead?  That
would probably make it harder for White to invade my moyo.

mes:  I don't like c5 much in that position.  It doesn't totally secure
the corner, and so doesn't feel as big as a response on the lower side.
Your move seems okay -- you cold also simply play the small knights
move, or invade with a large scale pincer around a.];W[dj]LB[lb:B]
[df:C][cg:E][dh:F][oj:D][co:A][pr:G]C[Fedya: I took quite a long time thinking about this [next\]
move, as I was trying to figure out where the biggest part of the board
is.  Unfortunately, I don't get a very good result out of this.  The
other moves I was thinking about are something like C5, M18, D14, and
P10.  I don't see what C5 does for me in that White can play in Q3, and
each of us ends up getting one corner.  B and C don't look very big,
either.  With P10, the question is whether it reduces White enough, and
whether I can connect out to something.

mes:  Let's take your proposed moves one at a time.   
First put m18 (B) out of your mind completely.  This is the sort of
move that should be played only in yose, or to help/threaten the eye
shape of a group of weak stones.  The second line is known as the line
of defeat for a reason.

Since your corner group is alive as it stands, this move should be left
to yose.

That's *assuming* that you don't have a better local move, which in this
case you do -- the hane at n16 which cuts off white's stone.  
The move at B would cause white to play here and eliminate the aji of
n16 while reducing your moyo in the upper right.  You will gain about 3
points of territory while white eliminates all your potential on the
upper side except the 10-15 points that are already territory for you
there.  Playing m18 would give white the game.  You might as well pass
as play m18.

A is not bad, it very nearly secures the corner and puts a little
pressure on white formation.   But it doesn't seem nearly severe enough,
and I fear it will push white into defending and take away your chance
for an invasion.

C is bad aji keshi.  Whenever you see two single stones more than two
lines apart, you should be thinking of an invasion.  Not that you should
always invade, but you don't want to push the opponent into defending
there unless it gives you something very valuable or simplifies the game
when you are already comfortably ahead.  C just doesn't do much for
black.  This side of the moyo is already higher so C isn't worth as much
as a play on the other side.  And this moyo is small right now anyway.

The white group in the upper right corner is still weak and you have the
stone at e15 poking around the corner -- this area is ripe for an
invasion at E or F.

Note that E (many variations) takes a key eyemaking point of white's
stones.  I think this is the best local play, and maybe the best play on
the board.

D (var) is also an excellent play.  this shoulder move limits white's
framework and gives black a nice beachhead in the center on white's side
of the board.    
I don't like your 31 at 'a' because it feels like aji keshi.  The right
side is not yet settled, so it is not obvious yet whether the invasion
is superior to a simple knights move at G.  Note that the knights move
helps the black stones at the same time as limiting white.  It's a
question of invasion versus reduction.  In general one should prefer
reductions when they enlarge one's own area, unless you know you are
behind and are trying to create complications.  Or occasionally, an area
is so big that it must be invaded.

Here I would wait until you know more about what the right side will
look like.

I've shown variations on what I consider the two best lines for the next
move, D and E.]
(;B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[nr]TR[jp]
C[mes:
This move is silly -- aji keshi.  You're probably thinking that this
helps make territory with the marked stone, but it doesn't.  As the
later moves show, these stones are damezumari and right next to white
thickness.  That's a recipe for disaster.  It would take two gote moves
to make that area territory -- you should only play this 39 *if* and
*after* it works out that way.

Which as you can see, it does not.  White captures these stones.]
;W[os];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp]LB[sp:A]C[mes:  This move 43 should be at A. This provides
better endgame potential -- I also believe it makes your group fully
alive without another move.  As it is white has some aji in here (see
'b'), though it's too small to play until the early yose.]
(;W[np]C[Fedya: This [ed: the next move at 'a'\] is a mistake.  I
should have played at M3 instead, I think.

mes:  I'm not sure this is the right move on the board, but locally
(given the board) it's better than M3.  The two stones at O3 are
small.   Sacrificing the two stones with an appropriate kikashi after
'a' gives a good result.  I don't like m3 here, because the buildup of
white's framework would be too big.  If you're going to play here,
controlling white's moyo is more important than whether you keep the two
stones, and the move that beats back white is the one you made.

White's cut in response to your play is definitely too small.  This
should be a hane above 'a', an extension above 44 or a move elsewhere.]

(;B[mp]
(;W[mq]C[Fedya: In looking at the position, I think I have to sacrifice
either the N4 stone, or the two stones at O2 and O3.

mes:  There is an important kikashi move for black at o5 (see c) and
now is the only time to play it.  Once white plays n2 it will not be
answered at p4, but by taking the two black stones. Note that right now,
and only right now, anything other than the submissive answer at p4 is
unplayable]
(;B[lq]C[Fedya: Looking at N2 instead of M3 here, I come across some
complicated ladders, but I think White can still win anyhow -- see the
variation.

mes:  agreed.  n2 is unplayable for black at 47.];W[mr];B[lr]
;W[ns]
(;B[ps]LB[sn:A][qm:B]C[mes:  this 51 is poor.  You are already alive in
seki/multi-step ko.  Taking this territory securely is a yose move.    Even when the time comes, you can secure it in sente by descending on
the other side (or hane and connect on the other side at A).  If white
doesn't respond, you will have a large followup available in yose.   
But don't even play this until the early yose.  Your move gives you no
followup but is still gote.  7 points in double gote in this middle game
stage is like giving up 2/3 of a move.  
Better not to play either now -- your group cannot be killed
unconditionally and there is still some aji in the white formation (the
peep at B), which might be useful if you invade, that a play at A would
remove.];W[cq]C[mes: Your move 53 is a bit submissive.  It
would make sense if the bottom side were larger, but it is not.  You
have a maximum of about 20 points in territory here and about 10 are
going to be yours almost no matter how you respond.    Larger gains are to be made by keeping white weak and separated.  With
this sequence, you make his life easy. See the variations at b.]

[al][ak][ap]C[mes: For
comparisons sake, I've counted some relative territory here..  Also
notice that you take gote here for this result.  In some of the results
I compare to, you can take sente.];W[mm]LB[oj:B][no:C]C[Fedya: Now I'm even further
behind.  White is going to get the entire left side, and has a jump on
central development.

mes:  I agree that you are now behind, but white does not necessarily
get the entire left side.  You've missed a number of opportunities to
limit white's moyos while expanding your own.

Note the two key plays you missed that would have held down the large
white moyo on the right -- the shoulder move at B, and the kikashi at C.
C had to be timed perfectly.  B could have been played at a number of
points and you correctly identified it earlier as an important move.
After 60, the black group created by B will attacked very heavily.
Before then, it could have held it's own easily.]
(;B[jj]C[Fedya: I took quite a long time to think about this move too.
I can't think of any way to stop White from getting a large amount of
territory on both the left side and the right side.  Is there a good
reduction move on either side of the board?  For what it's worth, in
another game I sent in for review, I had sente in a similar situation,
and suggested tengen as one of the moves I was thinking about.  The
reviewer responded that it served the purpose of connecting two groups,
but not much else.  I think tengen does the same here.

mes:  I'm not sure this tengen move really connects anything.  It is
safe (it can run up or down to safety), and it provides a foothold
from which you can assault the right side.  But it doesn't really help
the left side much.   It's probably too slow.  For a vague move like
this to be key, it must serve more than one purpose.  In some positions,
the tengen (or an intersection near it), ends up being a key friendly
point for 2 or 3 possible invasions, or it extends your own moyo in
addition to staring down at the opponents.  Here it really only serves
the one purpose.  If you were not already behind, it might be okay, but
you have some serious catching up to do and this move won't do it.

Go back for some variations on possible lines that might pull you out of
the fire.];W[ke];B[ie];W[dg]C[mes:  This white 64 has been coming a
while.  Now the left side cannot be easily invaded.  This move is worth
at least 20 points -- it's bigger than your previous
move.];B[jg]TR[ke][mm]LB[md:D][ni:A][oj:B][km:C][hm:E][gg:F]
[el:G][hk:H]C[Fedya: Another move I took a very long time to
play.    I eventually decided that this would stop White from advancing
too far into the center from L15, and help connect my stone at K10 out
so one of my groups.  Is there a better idea?

mes: Yes.  Once white has not responded to your tengen move -- don't be
so defensive.  You still have as much center power as white.  the tengen
stone is in no real danger.  Use it instead to reduce.  You can go
further in than you could before you played tengen and white did not
answer on the right.  And you need to, now that white has defended on
the left.

You could probably have gotten away with the shoulder hit at B in spite
of the marked stone at N7 now that you have your reinforcement at the
tengen.

Certainly the cap at A is safe now, where it would have been too deep
without the tengen stone to run out to.

Note, the aji of D is not completely extinguished although L15 makes an
immediate cut undesirable now.  This aji could still come into play if
the invasion put a black stone in the right place.

If you're going to connect the tengen to one of your groups, make it the
one which enlarges your area most. A move at C on the lower side expands
your moyo (maybe even gives you actual territory) because you are
already higher on the other side of your moyo.   
Playing 65 isn't nearly as big because the top moyo  1. is not as wide,
and 2.  is even in height already -- you need another move on the other
side to even *threaten* to surround territory. the chance that white
will ruin this is much greater.  On the bottom, you only need one more
move to make it invasion proof, and too deep an invasion will be
strongly attacked right now.  Picture a white play at E after you have
played C, versus a white play at F now.  A white stone at F right now
has nothing at all to worry about, it is already almost connected to the
left side.   
OTOH, If you played C, white E, then you will jump to G threatening both
an invasion on the left and surrounding E with H.   Without some very
skillful play by white, you will either make a large capture of E, or
ruin much of his territory on one side or the other while he is busy
escaping.

The invasion of E is really too deep, which means that you will probably
have a chance to play it yourself, making about 12 points of territory,
or better yet, jump to G if white doesn't get there first.]
;W[lg]
(;B[lb]LB[md:A]TR[ke][lg][ic]C[Fedya: I'd been thinking about this for some time, and finally
decided to do it, largely because I still have no idea what I should be
doing.

mes:  Now that white has played both of the marked stones, the aji of
the cut at A is pretty much gone, so this move is not quite the sin that
it was when you first suggested it.    it's still very small though, and not worth playing now.  Note that if
your marked stone was 1 point to the right -- this would connect your
groups and be quite large yose, although still probably not big enough
to play with that giant white moyo staring you  down and reductions of
it possible.

As it is this play gains very little since what you get on the right,
you lose on the left and white has no territory here to destroy, just a
stone which you're not going to capture anyway.

This is an important concept to grasp.  In positions like this, when you
have two territories that are split apart by an opposing stone that
surrounds no territory itself, a play there is very small unless it can
connect your two groups.  The play looks large because it is similar to
one where white has territory to be destroyed.  But here, not only
aren't you destroying white territory, when white responds, it hurts
*your* territory on the other side.

results.];W[kb];B[mc];W[ld];B[md];W[me];B[jb]TB[ib][hb][gb]

ya: I thought it was extremely important to stop White from playing the
monkey jump at H19.  I'm far enough behind already that I don't need
White playing moves like that which would put me in an even deeper hole.

mes: Careful -- while that's fairly big yose -- there are still middle
game plays to be made in this game.  The monkey jump vs. your play is
worth about 9 points miai.  I'm pretty sure a jump into white's right
side, or an enlargement of your bottom (especially one that contains a
threat to the left or right) is easily worth more than this, so your
move here is probably a mistake.

Note the point count here to compare to other plays...  The fact that
you were vulnerable to a monkey jump here means that your original play
at m18 was very nearly
worthless.];W[fg]LB[km:A][ni:B][el:C][mo:D]C[mes:  I like 75 at 'b' better.  It is slightly less big,
but leaves you with a big sente followup for just about the same total
endgame value.  Plus is doesn't strengthen white, which I think may end
up being worth more than the point you give up.  If white responds at
'a', then you've really won, since you're only 3-4 points worse, but
have sente.

I'm also not sure that the time has come for yose like this yet...

The potential in the center is fairly large -- points at A or B, even C
are important and contain serious threats.  Probably any of these is
bigger than your play in the long run.  Even D turns out to be quite
large -- note what happened when white cut there
later.]

C[Fedya: I don't know what this gains me, but I'm
still lost for ideas.  When I first went over this for review, one of my
ideas was M10.  I ended up playing it later, although it didn't reduce
White enough.

M10 is not deep enough.  You can safely go to N10/11.  After this 87,
you can attach at N8 as well.];W[gk];B[gl];W[hl];B[gm];W[il]
;B[jl];W[kn];B[jn];W[lp];B[kp];W[lo]C[mes:  Your 'a' is small and merely goads white
into defending.  A move at n8 is good here, but won't work after white
play m7.  What were you aftraid of here?

If you play 'b' you still aren't all that far behind.  I've given at
least one sample sequence and played out some of your large sente
endgame sequences and you are still close.

This 'a' may actually be the losing move.  You are behind here, but not
yet by a lot until you let white defend once more.]

this helps, though.  The only other things I can see right now is to try
B5 or C18, but I don't think even that helps enough.  As it is, I'm
behind by about 20:

White has 60 on the right and 40 on the left for

Black has maybe 40 on the bottom, 20 in the top center, and 10 in
each of the right-side corners for 80.

mes: Careful with your counts.  This is what it looks like right now --
but even after your too shallow reduction of the right side, play your
endgame in sente and you don't do too bad.  B5 is a mistake because you
will end in Gote.  Just hane -- white must draw back, and you play again
and connect, all in sente.  See my variations for you.

Also see my variation a few moves back for how close you can come with a
deeper reduction.]

there's anything big left on the board, however, and I'm probably too
far behind to catch up.

There are bigger moves -- you should make your sente plays first at A,
B, C and D.

White may probably fail to answer at some point, but that would
complicate the game, which you want since you're behind.  If not, you
keep getting points instead of white.  That's how you catch up -- taking
sente!];W[lk];B[kk];W[jd];B[id];W[mj];B[li];W[df];B[ls]C[Fedya: I finally saw that if White

sente.  Better to play them first and then play here.  Of course, if
white is good, he will trade and you get to play mutual destruction, but
that complicates the game, which helps the player behind -- you.

BTW, never say "It doesn't matter because the game is already lost."  If
it doesn't matter, then resign.    If you keep playing it's either to learn something from the

studying.  Note that if the game were closer or you were ahead, white's
move 200 here would be a mistake.  Played at A, it gaurantees capture of
5 stones, rather than two.  This is the kind of formation that if you

from the shoulder hit.  White could push out more but that just makes
your influence bigger.  There is no real attack against these black
stones as you can help them either with a jump to A, or the cut at B, or
simply run them to the center around tengen.]))
(;B[md];W[mc];B[me]C[This might still be the move you should play, but
now white will freely make an extension to K3/4.

The moyo is reduced and you have made a large moyo yourself, but the q16
stones are secure.  Compare to playing the cut without the hane and
connection -- white would be vulnerable to an invasion.]))
(;B[md]TR[lc]C[mes: Two ways to go for white here.  With 'a' (probably better
for white), white sacrifices the marked stone, with 'b', he fights.
But you probably capture the marked stone anyway -- this option would
make more sense if you had  a thin position on the upper side.]

(;W[me];B[ld]C[This variation keeps white's moyo large, but your capture
is pretty much secure and quite large.  You should be satisfied.  If
you're worried, you can always kakari first and keep this in reserve,
but this point seems too important to miss to me.  You are getting 4th
line territory here.];W[le];B[kd];W[jp])
(;W[mc];B[me]LB[ni:A][rc:B][ng:C][pg:D][kd:E]C[Note that white will have trouble escaping with his top
two stones.  Also, black now threatens an invasion around D which would
ruin white's moyo and threaten to surround and capture (or at least
strongly attack) white's wall stones.  I've shown a few variations
where white extends to a and allows this invasion, they all look pretty
good for black.  I think white is obligated to defend here in some way,
probably with a jump to somewhere around A, or with the hane and
connection at B.  With the latter white will keep sente, but your 23
stone means that his area is not large -- you can jump into the moyo at
will.   
If white plays A or C, then you have cut in sente, expanding your own
moyo and reducing white's.  You can secure a capture of the two stones
at E, or leave open the possibility of a fight and take the extension at
a, or kakari in the lower right and be very satisfied.  You would be
winning this game.

Defending around C would be very unsatisfying for white.  You would
later hane and connect in sente and white has played a lot of stones for
a small area.   
See the timing -- you wait on the hane and connect until white has
commited enough stones that this is definitely territory, and not
invadable or attackable in any way.];W[jq];B[pg]

[ng][lg]C[mes: Black is developing beautifully.
Look at what the marked black stones are doing to the center, especially
if black gets to play A also (which will be sente against the two
marked white stones).  Black's group is quite safe -- a slide to B will
give at least one eye and threatens to take a large corner with C.   
Black (you) should leave this point until it becomes clear whether you
need eyes, because the invasion of C is bigger, as long as your outside
stones are completely secure.   If they become strongly threatened, you
would need to play B to make eyes.

This or something similar would be an excellent development for
black.])

;B[if]LB[ph:A]C[mes: White's in trouble here.  Thickness did not really
materialize as it should have because of your own wall in the upper
left.  He'll escape, but you'll build more power and then come down on
the right side with A.  Or kakari at the bottom  and build a moyo that
will be hard to attack because of your center thickness.])))

[bd][ad][da]C[mes: You have niren sei on the bottom, and thickness on top.
White has about 15 points of territory.  There is a saying that ponnuki
is worth 30 points.  That probably stretches it a bit, but I think that
this early, and with this position (everyone on star points looking for
central influence) your thickness is more valuable than white's
territory, even though white pokes out on both sides.

This would be an excellent opening for black.  It almost feels like a
two stone game.])

(;W[hc];B[cd];W[de];B[dh]C[mes: This gets the fighting started really
early, but looks pretty good for black, IMO.  Black can live in the
corner with one move, the white groups are split apart, one is weak and
black will develop on the right side by attacking it.  If white
sacrifices it, the profit will be large.])
(;W[ge];B[ef]LB[gc:A][bd:B]C[mes: This fight doesn't seem bad for black.
Note the cut at A which black can go back to in gote to make eyes at
need.  Also black can take the corner at B for some proit.  This is
probably better for white than the other variation on the counter
pincer.  Seems even to me given that white got to play an extra move in
the corner.])))
