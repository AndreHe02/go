[po];B[pl];W[oq]L[qq]C[Not what I'm used to, but at least a valid response  instead of the 'a' I  have been getting from people lately.

TH: Smart Go is not showing me your 'a' move, so I won't be able to answer  some questions.]
;B[or]C[TH: White at P4 is normal joseki here.]
(;W[nq]C[I  expect 'a', though I was thinking 'why not this for white?' when he  played it.]
;B[pp]L[oo]C[Was not sure what to do, but this seemed a way to  stabilize my corner, and I felt the common 'a' response would let me cut.

TH: Black 13 is reasonable.];W[oo]M[pl][ip]C[I really felt I could push through and  cut this and capture one of the groups with my marked stones in place.

TH: push and cut is aggressive, but may be warranted here.];B[op];W[np]
;B[no];W[qo]C[WHite plays the moves I expecte, but immediately, rather  than later.
 These forcing moves seem to help out white's outside groups,
 but I still manage to catch one.];B[rq];W[nr];B[pr];W[rp];B[qp];W[ro];B
[rr];W[rl];B[mo]L[qk]C[I really wanted to play 'a', but I wanted more to catch  one of the  groups.]
;W[kq];B[lq];W[lr]C[TH: Both a and b are unreasonable.  c is best,  and plan to contain white.]

(;B[mr]L[kr]C[Later, pjl comments that this would  be better at 'a'. I look at it in the previous move variation.

TH: white should play at M4!]
(;W[mq];B[lp]C[TH: white can live with K2.]
(;W[ms];B[jr];W[kr];B[jq]
(;W[jo]C[This shocked me. I was actually getting  nervous about white 'a'.
The variation on the previous moves shows what I feared.];B[kp];W[jp];B
[io];W[jn];B[ks]C[SO, I make the kill move. But, White is able to do some very
high level squeezing, and ends up with influence to spare.

TH: Yes, white gets lots of outside power.  White at O6 is another  possibility.]

;B[im];W[jl];B[fo]C[TH: white  must play at R9.]
(;W[pk]M[nn][oo][po][qo][ro][rp]C[Now I get nervous. White has really wrapped me up.  I felt my only chance was to capture the marked stones, which I do, but
I wonder if there was a better way.];B[ql];W[qk];B[rm];W[ol]C[I read the previous, but  not this. I felt I had room to spare, but this  brings it to within a liberty.]
;B[pm]C[Is there anything better? I thought  this was the only move.];W
[rk]C[TH: When black plays at P6, it's one eye to  no eye -- black will win easily.]

(;B[rn]C[Again, I thought this was the only  move, because it takes the liberty, was  I wrong?]
;W[sm];B[sn];W[sl]C[
TH: "Don't approach thickness".  Black R14 would be better.]
(;B[qg]C[Played  when I felt I'd secured the lower right. I am
trying to oppose the awesome wall. Would closer to the corner be better?
Eventually losing this corner gets me into a lot of trouble later.];W[on]

;W[jc]C[TH:  Black has a big lead -- I  would play more simply at C17.]

(;B[cg]C[I expect 'a', where I get 'b'
and chances for life. I'm curious what a better move might be to
prevent a super-big white area.];W[ci]C[Now I'm getting nervous. I've
forgotten the standard moves for living this stone by attaching. It's
been a very long time since i've had the ogeima pincered.

TH: Ogeima approach to hoshi is non-standard.  You may be thinking of  approaching 3-4.  Black at B16 should live.]

this group just to continue.];B[hg];W[id];B[ig];W[kg];B[if];W[he];B[ie]

;B[kd];W[jd];B[ik];W[ij];B[hk];W[hj];B[gj];W[jf]C[TH: Black C5 is much bigger and threatens the white group.  Then  later play P17 and take a big corner.]

ething better?];W[qd];B[pc]C[Please suggest a better sequence. I know I can't  kill white,
but how do I stabilize quickly?  What a lesson in thickness.];W[qc]C[TH:  Black R15 is better -- enclose white in the corner and keep connected.]

This is to wrap up the corner, but also, if I can then connect my marked st
ones out, I'll be cutting off the white group again. Maybe I could anyway,
and this move isn't needed. Even if these stones are rescued, I trail by ov
