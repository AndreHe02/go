AB[pd][dp]C[[Agi\] Hi, I'm Agilis of KGS and I'll be reviewing this game mostly from white's perspective and I'll be tagging my comments for ease of reference.]
PL[W];W[op];B[dd];W[qp]C[[Agi\] Against 2 handicap, white doesn't normally really need to make  major chances in their playing to have a chance of catching up. From this perspective, enclosing here probably isn't much of a problem. That said, I can't help but feel that enclosing is a bit slow.]
;B[dj];W[pj]LB[jc:C][pf:B][qf:A]C[[Agi\] This move feels really slow for white. It's ignoring the fact that black is developing quickly on the left, Something more forceful like A/B feels much more active. White would like to take control of the flow of the game.

Something around C to break up black's formation on a large scale is also worth considering]
;B[jq]C[[Agi\] Black is developing calmly over most of the board. If things continue on at this pace, white stands little chance of catching up without something needing to die.]
;W[mq]LB[fc:C][jc:D][pf:B][qf:A]TR[jq]C[[Agi\] This looks really passive, like it was trying to defend the corner.It looks like it's trying to set up an attack on the marked stone, but it feels too far to be helpful when a fight breaks out.

Instead, following up P10 with A/B would be more consistent. Considering something like C or D to change the pace and break up black's framework is also an option to think of.]
;B[jd]C[[Agi\] black has successfully turned the top and left sides of the board into something like a 6 or 9 handicap position. Considering that this was a 2H game, white's chances of invading and making profitable life/killing something are much smaller.]
;W[fq]LB[hq:A]TR[jq]C[[Agi\] White finally tries to make an attack, however, black could pincer with A, helping the marked stone, and driving white up into black's moyo.]
;B[dn]TR[jq]C[[Agi\] However, black is very calm here. The lone black stone isn't in great danger just yet because there's still a fair amount of slace on the sides, and plenty of black stones up top.]
;W[dr];B[cq]
(;W[hp]C[[Agi\] It looks like white is continuing to attack that one stone,  However, this shape isn't very satisfying if black gets free. White needs to pay a bit of attention to make sure the 3 white stones don't come under attack themselves. see variation.]
;B[jo];W[hn];B[mo]C[[Agi\] Black feels more or less safe now.]
;W[qf];B[pf]C[[Agi\] This is probably a good choice of joseki on black's part]
;W[pg];B[of]
(;W[qm]C[[Agi\] However, white departs from joseki first.];B[qe]

(;W[rg];B[rf];W[qg]TR[qf]C[[Agi\] Black just feels like he got much more than he should here. Is saving the marked stone worth taking gote here? How many points would black gain if white just sacrificed it?]
;B[ni]C[[Agi[ Black continues to ambitiously grow his moyo.]
;W[nk]LB[hq:B][lq:A][hr:C][mr:D]TR[jo][mo][jq]C[[Agi\] This move is dubious. Looking from the sidelines, it looks like white is trying to do 2 things.

1) trying to enclose the marked black stones from a distance. However, it will take  at least another 2-3 moves to finish, and there's still the chance that group can make life on the bottom with some help from some combination of a/b/c/d

2) It also looks like white is trying to grow his own framework of stones to reach into black's framework. Except black's framework is much larger, and growing much faster.]
;B[ce]C[[Agi\] Again, black knows he's ahead and is solidifying. Every move white avoids invading, the whole top and left side gets stronger. Black reinforces towards the left side since the top right is much more solid.]

(;W[fc]LB[eb:C][jc:B][ng:A][dl:D]C[[Agi\] There's really no obvious place to invade, However, some options to consider, see variations]
;B[ec];W[cc]C[[Agi[ this is somewhat weird, since white can't live inside, and really doesn't want to. So what could white be threatening here?]
;B[bd]
(;W[dc]C[[Agi\] Again, the important side is the outside, and this move seems to be saying otherwise.]
;B[eb];W[fd];B[ed];W[jc];B[kc];W[kd]
(;B[lc];W[ic];B[je];W[he];B[fg];W[hg];B[hi];W[hk]C[[Agi\] It's usually not a good idea to abandon a weak group that's being attacked]
;B[fi];W[jf];B[ke];W[ji];B[ij];W[jl];B[jj];W[lk];B[hr]C[[Agi\] This move is very much sente if you intend to kill black.]

(;W[no]C[[Agi\] Play from the weaker side, not to mention this makes an empty triangle for little reason. see variation]
;B[nn];W[mn]TR[mm]C[[Agi\] Why cut here and give black forcing moves? if black is so bent on connecting, a peep would have served the same purpose. You would only cut here if you thought black would get away, and so you wanted to catch the 2 stones as compensation.]
;B[ln];W[mm];B[lm];W[jm];B[gq]C[[Agi\] and black makes the cut white left lying around. There doesn't quite seem to be a way for white to resist.]

;B[eq];W[bq];B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[em]TR[kk][mk][ok][gl][ml][fm]
C[[Agi\] Another strange move. Saving 2 stones isn't important enough when the white group in the middle is in tatters. Black has lived on the bottom, so all the loose cutting points that white created while trying to kill black are still there for exploitation. There is a very strong possibility that white can die in the center]

(;B[jb]C[[Agi\] Black seems to be assuming that white is alive in the center. See variation]
;W[ib];B[pi];W[oi];B[oh];W[ph];B[qi];C[Result: B+Resign

[Agi\] Much of white's problems came from letting black build up a very large framework early on, and then have extra moves to secure large areas of it. 

When one side builts a very large framework, it's usually reasonable to expect to turn about half or a third of it into solid territory after the opponent invades. Here, black seems to have gotten about 2/3rds, not to mention a chance to kill the center white group.

In handicap games, white has to be willing to leave formations a bit looser and less settled, trusting on his better reading and positional judgement to catch up to black. In a 2 stone game, white just needs to accomplish this once or twice early on to catch up. However, if an opening appears and white hesitates, a second chance may never come again.]

(;B[gp];W[fo];B[go]C[[Agi\]  Black just has more liberties than this white group can get.]
))
(;W[mm]C[[Agi\] Threatening the cut this way helps strengthen the string of stones in the center, and reduces black's room to run. The bottom is alive anyway.]
;B[nn]C[[Agi\] If black decides to connect, now is the time to fix the cut]
;W[gq]TR[hq][iq][gr]C[[Agi\] Here, black will have a very hard time living. White can even be more forceful with protecting the cut, perhaps at the marked points.]
))
(;W[gq]C[[Agi\] At the very least, white needs to fix the cut this threatens.]
))
(;B[je]TR[kd]C[[Agi\] Black probably would have been better off extending here. There's plenty of black stones around to kill the marked white stone even if it tried to escape.]
;W[lc];B[kb]
(;W[lb];B[jb];W[ic];B[ib];W[hc];B[ha]C[[Agi\] black is happily connected]
)
(;W[jb];B[lb];W[mc];B[mb]TR[pd][je][of][ni]C[[Agi\] Even crawling here shouldn't be a problem because of all the black stones around. So long as white remains cut off, white is trapped inside and will drown.]
)))
(;W[eb]C[[Agi\] One way to use the white stone would be this. Except black would press white down.]
;B[fd];W[dc];B[ed];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc]C[[Agi\] not particularly satisfying, but not too disappointing either.]

(;W[jc]C[[Agi\] Perhaps lean on black to try to make shape.]
;B[ic];W[id];B[je];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb]C[[Agi\] still not very satisfying, but life does look doable]

(;W[ge]C[[Agi\] White can also just run to wide spaces, surviving in black's framework would already be a success]

(;W[ng]TR[ni]C[[Agi\] This move aims at attacking the marked stone, as well as pushing black down.]
;B[og];W[oh];B[nh];W[mg]C[[Agi\] a difficult battle will come of this, but white has little choice]
;B[oi];W[ph];B[pi];W[qi]LB[re:A][qj:B]C[[Agi\] White can just barely put up a fight here because the areas around A/B give whtie some options, so he's not afraid of being cut]
)
(;W[jc]LB[dd:B][pd:A]C[[Agi\] Moves like this are sacrifice moves, depending on black's responce, white will sacrifice one or more stones to make shape, and hopefully  create a group to work with. However, thanks to A and B both being strong, alive, black groups Black has very little to worry about, so he can focus all his attention on attacking white.]
)
(;W[dl]LB[hl:A]C[[Agi\] A reduction here might be feasible, though it's hard to say how black will respond. Ideally you'd want a few white stones at around A first.]

(;W[hq]C[[Agi\] While low and somewhat cramped, these stones are more stable. If black were to run, white wouldn't have to wory about keeping that group alive]
;B[jo];W[gn]C[[Agi\] Something like this would continue to attack the black stones from a distance, while also giving white follow up moves inside black's framework]
;B[mo]TR[fc][cf][qf][cl][dl][jm][lo][kp]C[[Agi\] Of course, black isn't in a huge amount of danger, there's simply too much space around. However, white has things to look forward to playing when the time is right.]
