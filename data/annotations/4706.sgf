C[R: Hello!  I'll mark my comments with "R:". I hope it will help. 

Hello reviewer. In this game I am philip101 (12 k kgs) as black against TSUNENAGA (11 k kgs). I made an endgame mistake which cost me about 15 points, but otherwise the game was close throughout. Thanks in advance for any help. I have made a few comments throughout the game.

R: No i dont think so. Strengthen your weak side. Thats OK. Plus K5 is play against the wall.

However I would consider tenuki here. B corner is strong.];W[on]
;B[cf]TR[cm][co][cp]SQ[bh][ch][bi][ci]C[R: Black's position is low on the lower left corner (triangles) so it's not a good idea to try make territory here .]

(;B[ci]C[R: Black should try heighten his position. Escpecially if you want to play d7 afterwards. See var.]

R: This move always dangerous. Black has to find ko threats over 4 points, while it will cost only 0.5 for white. Usually bad business.  q18 is ok of course.]

Overall it was not a bad game, without the last mistake B would have win indeed.
