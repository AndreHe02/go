janr: I think the difference is very small.  This sequence doesn't seem impossible to me.]

Here, I had no idea what to do, I've never seen this before.

(;B[lc]LB[hc:A]C[I felt this was bad timing after the game, too early, am I right?

janr: it is often played with a black stone at A.  Now, it may be a bit early given the many other large points still open.]

It seems better to try to make the topright area, theatening to separate the three white stones above from the top left.  If white is forced to connect on the second line, this is good for black.]

janr: yes, white must not get the center.  
The first big mistake was the lower left corner (after not answering white's sente).  Then, there were a few chances to reduce whites influence, but in the end he made a lot of territory with it.]
