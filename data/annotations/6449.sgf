C[Dear Reviewer,

In this game on KGS I had white and won the game thanks to a blunder from my opponent near the end of the game.

White played what seemed to me a very territorial style of game. I struggle playing against territory minded players since I prefer moyo or fighting games to create more possibilities.

I am hoping you can give me hints on how to attack more severely or provoke advantageous fighting conditions against territorial style playing.

I have added comments at the different moves to let you know my thinking and perhaps this will help you in providing advice.

Thank you,

C[P: seems early for black to play this (erases aji)
pet: you're right, too early;];W[re];B[me];W[qp];B[qn]C[P: I was not sure of the best response, my main intention was to separate the 2 black stones
pet: 
good idea, but this will also cost you something (at least hard fighting),
since b was playing here first. see  vars move 30];W[op]C[pet: good move!]
;B[np];W[oo];B[pq];W[qo];B[pn]C[pet: so far all forced moves]

(;W[no]TR[nq]SQ[oo][qo][op][qp]C[pet: 
this is called: 'pushing from behind' and should be avoided, since opponent is allways 1 move ahead.
In this case you erase also aji at o3 and help b to connect the whole bottom.

But then how to help the r4- group: See variations];B[mp]
(;W[nm]C[pet: this is not the right shape,
see var];B[pk]C[pet:
after all w is a bit slow, so b gets the opportunity to settle himself.
Perhaps this makes you fear b's growing territory.
The result here is better for b here.];W[qq]C[slow, but correct now]
;B[kq]LB[fc:B][ci:D][cl:C][mo:A]C[P: black plays a very defensive play but also gets territory
pet: this move is in fact too defensiv;
if b would play here (what seems to be not really necessary),
he would play A (which makes good shape)

Good moves for b would be elsewhere (B,C,D)];W[qi]C[pet: 
locally the right point, but...

this extension plays from the strong group (above) to make territory, which is usually bad.
[Both groups getting stronger, in this case it helps the weaker group more\]
proverb says: Don't make territory from a strong group (or wall)]
;B[qj];W[pi];B[nk]
(;W[ln]LB[ql:A]C[P: I want to continue to separate black.

pet: I can understand the idea, but the r6-group would'nt die anyway, and m6 is no forcing move for the bottom group, so this is very slow.

So locally you can get a bit profit by playing A (see var)
In fact w would save this for later];B[fc]C[pet: now b got the big point]
;W[df];B[id]C[pet: j16 looks unusual, but fine to me, b is ahead now;
still i would more feel like playing f15]
(;W[ec]C[pet: this is again a slow move,
as  you know it is gote or leaves open the corner (c17), and let play b F16 is called a 'thank you move']
;B[fd];W[cj]LB[cc:D][ch:A][cl:B][ql:E][cq:C]C[P: At this point, it seems very even in terms of probable territories.
pet:
In a decent look you will find that b can play A to D, while w has allmost nothing then E, which is not killing, but might be sente.
So in conclusion i would say, even if w gets E and can play first to defend A, B or D (C is gote for black and should not be defended first)
w is still behind, while b has allready quite a lot of territory.

Perhaps that's why you gave this game into review.
The reason of this is clearly too many slow white moves!];B[cl]

(;W[cn];B[cm]C[P: Black has a weak group, but I am not sure how take advantage
pet: this is a difficult task, so your felling is right];W[ff]

(;W[cb]C[P: I hesitated a long time and finally decided to play this proper move for good shape in the corner.
pet: :-)) good shape, but not nesseary (too slow), see vars ...]
;B[if];W[fo]TR[cf][cg]C[pet: good move
since c14 stones are 'very' dead, b has lost a lot of his advantage, game is now open again]
;B[bm]
(;W[ni]LB[kf:C][pf:D][ql:A][hp:B]C[P: I am still unsure where to play but erasing the middle while pressuring a little bit the black group on the right seemed to be the best option, I will need to be patient to attack.

pet: again right feeling, your move walks into neutral area.
[b can play Q14 when he likes\] 
A would still be the proper move, but now it would hurt b even more since both groups on the sides are not 100% alive.

alternative B and C would do it, but might be a bit 'high leveled'; see vars

D is bad (at the moment, far to slow)];B[oj];W[oi];B[gm]LB[hp:A]
C[pet: still A is the point];W[eq]LB[fp:A][er:B]C[pet: 
bad move, erases a lot of aji;

;B[nb];W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[hb]C[P: I did not really know how I could strike at black so I felt it was time to take some bigger endgame points.

pet: since b is alive now, allright];W[pf];B[rn];W[ro];B[ej]
;W[dj];B[fj]C[pet: here b gives another some points (too slow, no threat)]
;W[gh];B[of];W[ge];B[rg]C[P: this move obviously caught me by surprise, good play by black.]

(;W[rf]LB[qh:B][rj:A]C[pet: too easy for black.

give A a try (this might be hard work extremly difficult, but not hopeless)
easy is B

;W[dg]C[P: The game is tight and yet I play this strange move, I was thinking of aji, but I should have first taken G16 for example.
pet: yes];B[ll];W[lk];B[gd];W[im];B[sh];W[sf];B[pp];W[po];B[nq]
;W[ei];B[tt]C[P: the game seems over and it looks like black wins by a tight margin.]
;W[fe];B[tt]C[P: Black passes again and white has to try something to win...]
;W[ic];B[jd];W[ib];B[ia]C[P: The losing move, K18 is the move black should have played, this ko will be painful for black.

Even if I can not win the ko, I expect compensation elsewhere to be enough to win the game. White has many more ko threats since black did play a bit thin in some shapes...

In the end white wins because of this ko.

pet:
so one can say lucky win.

frist of all:
your feeling of having trouble playing against an opponent making a lot of territory is right;

second:
but this is because of the amount of slow moves, not because of the style of your opponent.
b was just a bit defensive and makes very safe moves 
(which are sometimes also slow) and of this you can't take advantage, cause b waits for any slow w move and got some 
points extra, more then once.

so i think you improve (not only a bit) if you get a clear jugement about the following:

1) urgent move (not difficult, you urgent move i think)
2) double sente move (moves which are for both players sente)
3) sente moves (opponent has to answer)
4) reverse sente (prevent opponents sente)
5) gote (bigger moves first, you can only play one gote move, then oppontent play all his sente moves)

perhaps it helps, when you guess which kind of move you are playing and compare your guessing with your opponents answer

I hope the review was proper, if you have any further questions let me know (KGS: pet), you can leave a message.
