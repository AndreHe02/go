C[tetchu [16k\]: hi





omgwtf: I'd like to know what the weakest / strongest part of my game is (as compared to other 17 kyu or my opponent, for example), so that I may know what I should study further. Also, if the esteemed Reviewer's stronger eyes spots anything critical that my weaker eyes missed, it would be nice with a variation on it. :)



But please note, I make some VERY silly reading mistakes in this game, which are really unlike me, so please don't be too harsh about that. ;)]
;B[kd];W[dc]C[omgwtf [17k\]: hi];B[de]C[Im not shure if this is a bad move. But the w 3x4 move is strong. Technicaly w dont need to answer this and could still live. I think this early the corners should be occupied first as they are easy profit.]
;W[ed];B[gd]LB[gc:A][ic:C][id:D][ee:B]C[This is too high, as white can slip under your black stone later, desroying your teritory very easy. A move at A would be better.

Although A is better, its a bit too far from L10, White can play at C or D.

Next it could be better to save your D9 Stone (B). Its very weak and if w starts to attack this stone later, it could get expensive to save it.

At this point, there are still 2 corners which should be played.

First the corners.
Than the side,
Last the middle ... :)]
(;W[kj];B[cj];W[ik];B[jg]LB[cg:B][kg:A]C[Again, too high, w can slip under your stone. Think twice if you want to play a stone higher than the lowest stone of your opponend.

I think a Stone at B would be better as it saves the Stone at D9, creates territory for sure and weakens the 2 w stones at the top.]

(;W[ek];B[cc]C[

omgwtf: I do not really know any joseki (which will soon become very apparent when I misread); I just try different random things and reject it for later use when it doesn't work.

Its a good move :)];W[cd]
(;B[ce]LB[dd:A]C[Cut! (A)

Some very good Player once said to me, "cut first, think later". 

You should not generaly take every cut you can get, but mosly it makes more trouble for your opponend than for you ;)]
;W[bc];B[dd]LB[cb:A]C[The cut here is too late. Its not a cut any more.

Another nice "rule" to remember: if you are in Atari on the 3rd line, decent! (A); This gives your Stones 3 more Liberties at no cost ( W must answer it, so B keeps sente ) and leaves some bad aji that might be helpfull later.]
;W[cb];B[fe]LB[fb:B][ec:C][fc:A]C[I think your stone is to keep the white in the corner. 

But the w stones already have access to the center from the Bottom. its wide open there.

Black at A threatens a cut at C and might close your teritory at the upper side in sente,  B would make your teritory even more save.]

;W[fb]C[

omgwtf: I managed to shut him in, but I was not really happy because I have a lot of cutting points and ladders that might not work...


You have done well, and you have sente. 
If you are not happy with your cutting points , you could protect them now.]
;B[hj]LB[ff:A][lh:D][ej:B][dk:C]C[looks like you are playing a ladder breaker for the cut at A

This cut wouldnt work, as the group at the upper rigtht is alive, and the group at the left side is alive too.

I think i would play at B or C to get profit :)

Because of your K7 Stone (too high!)  you should also consider D]
;W[be];B[cf]LB[bf:B][cg:A]TR[ce][de]C[9 out of 10 times an empty triangle is ineffective. Try to avoid it. 

In this case W can push you again with B. 

Black at A  instead would give you a better shape localy.];W[hk]

(;B[gk]LB[gj:A]C[very dangerous; White is very strong in this corner and your stones are weak. keep them together. (A)]
;W[gj]
(;B[fl]C[Bad; its hard to imagine for black to get out of this without damage ...]
;W[fk];B[el]LB[bk:C][ck:B][dk:A]C[Not good, W can push you on the 2nd Line playing A B C

You would giveup big teritory to _maybe_ save 2 of your stones. It didnt happen, luck for you ..]

How about A or B?];W[dj];B[di];W[ej];B[ck];W[dh];B[ch];W[ei]

omgwtf: In retrospect, I believe this move would have been better placed at A...


I would say B instead of A, as you still can play A if you are loosing the ko :)

But a ko should be played last anyway.];W[ha];B[ia];W[ga];B[ic]
LB[ja:C][ib:A][jb:B]C[Never ever!!

That Stone belongs at A!

maybe B in some special cases.

That way you have created an empty triangle but also ( which is much worse ) a Ko thread at C for white.

and actualy there is a ko that have to be played soon ...];W[fm]

[cl][dl][am][bm][cm]C[Ok. I think your "figthing skills" are not that bad. 
But by figthing you shouldnt forgett the whole Board situation. 

Not every Stone is worth figthting for. If you do a mistake (H4) dont try to turn it into a sucsessfull move at any cost. you got lucky with your move, but it was whites fault.

Your early stones where well-grounded, but there often had some defects that might had crush you if your opponend where stronger. 

The best way to get stronger is to play games with someone stronger. You may get crushed, but if your opponend exploit your defects you will see it yourself very soon.

At last, your learn more from games you have lost than from games you have won :)]
