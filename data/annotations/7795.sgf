;B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[Often, you demonstrate good reading.  Sometimes, you miss stuff.  (I pointed out a few ideas.)
Your opening seems very good, especially for 16k.
You wasted many moves in the midgame, especially around P9.  I'm not sure whether you were trying to attack R9 (which was already alive, and thus unattackable) or connect your center group to your bottom group (both of  which were strong, and thus did not need to be connected.

How to improve?  When I play, I often feel pressured by the time limit.  Go back afterwards and review your games, asking these questions:
What were your reasons for each move?
Were those really valid reasons?
What would have been the cost of omitting that move?
Is there a bigger play you could have made elsewhere?

You're doing great.  Keep playing, and keep having fun!])
