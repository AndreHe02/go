C[In this game I played Black.

I feel that I lost the game early on by playing moves that allowed me to get separated, giving White weak groups to pick on.  I feel I can say this after having reviewed the game in hindsight, but I don't think it was so obvious to me while I was actually playing the game.  Especially since some of the problems with getting separated didn't really manifest themselves until quite a few moves afterwards.  The problem is that, even if my feeling is right, I am not sure I would be able to avoid similar problems in the future.  I would appreciate any advice you could give me to help me improve.

Thanks!

R: please see my comments throughout the game preceded with the R:

R: Generally, you are right about the getting separated but you also played that way.  I'd suggest trying to work on the whole board perspective to see how your stones can cooperate, don't get enclosed early.

R: Hope this helps.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo]C[R: I actually don't like doing this because of W's next move.  You might try to get C/D15 in first.]
;W[jp];B[de];W[dd];B[ce];W[cj]C[R: This is an attack on your C15 group that warrants reinforcement.  Sliding into to the corner now I believe is still sente because D17 group is put under pressure.  If my variation (from move 10), B retains outside influence looks stonger and begins to make W's C10 weaker.]
(;B[jc]C[R: This plays into W's hands by offering a way for W to split K17 from D15.]
;W[ee];B[bc];W[ef]C[R: W is attacking, making/keeping the C15 group weak.]
(;B[pj];W[cg];B[cb];W[bd];B[cd];W[cc];B[be];W[bb];B[ad];W[db]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[ag]C[R: and the result is you live in gote and W gets settled  with a nice outside wall.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[je]
(;B[ld]TR[gc][hd]C[My intention was to try to split White's O17 and K15 groups.  I ended up getting split myself, though.  I felt that the triangle moves might have been less aggressive and more solid, but I remembered the saying about not playing close to thickness.]
;W[le];B[me];W[kd]
(;B[kc]C[R: too many cut points.  I'd try a solid connection at N16 (see variation). I think, either you get a better shape at the top and W O16 group is still under pressure or W gives up 2 stones giving you a nice big corner in exchange for W getting the area around G17.]
;W[md];B[lc];W[ne]C[R: So unless you've read out the ensuing running battle, W is out and your job is to get life at the top.]

;B[oi];W[pg];B[oh];W[og];B[qf];W[ni];B[oj];W[nj];B[qg]C[Black is reasonably secure on the right side, but there are two weak groups at L17 and N13.]
;W[mj];B[kf];W[lg]
(;B[lf]C[R: The double atari may have been better.  You can get K15 in a net. (See variation from move 62).]

;W[he];B[id];W[hf]TR[gc][ii]C[Now Black is faced with a choice:  strengthen the top group and leave the middle to fend for itself, or vice versa.

R: I think you already made this choice when you invested more stones on the center group.]
(;B[ii];W[hb]C[Life looks hard for the upper group.

R: consider leaving it alone for ko threats.];B[hc];W[gb];B[ib]

(;B[fq]C[White's moves on the left gave Black sente.  I approached in the bottom left.  One alternative offered was that I could instead harass the currently eyeless White group at O16, something like the alternative, to gain profit on the side.  What do you think?

R: Possibly.  W has many ways to run tho' and in doing so makes your invasioin harder.

R: I like the M4 bottom extension first. (See variation from move 90).  It might be called a leaning attack ready for a more meaningful attack on the O16 group and still leaves the C3 invasion available.]
;W[dq]
(;B[cn]C[R: This is like self-splitting your stones.  I prefer a jump to the center, it potentially connects to J11 and attacks K4.  (See variation from Move 92)]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[co];B[fo];W[dn];B[ep]C[R: Getting this ponnuki is lucky.  Use it to force W to live in a narrow space or have W run to the center.  (See variation from move 100.)]

(;B[jk]C[R: K9 makes too little territory compared to a move on the bottom edge. (at least do L9.)]
;W[nr]C[R: I don't think the next 2 B moves help. Sometimes it's worth remembering a stone should try to do 4 things.  -Strengthen one of your own stones.
-Weaken one of your opponents stones.
-Expand your territory.
-Reduce your opponents territory.
If it does all 4 at once it's a great move: 3, pretty good: 2 things, may be ok: 1, not so good: 0 need some tutoring.

R: What about the alternatives to moves 113 and 117.]
(;B[ej];W[dm]
(;B[dg];W[eg];B[dh];W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[df];W[dj]C[R: Again time to start pushing on W's positions to make yours bigger and W's smaller, keeping sente as much as possible.  See variation for suggestions.

R: invading the bottom takes a  lot of readng.]
(;B[nq];W[or]C[After White played this move, I realized what an awful move 125 was.   I try to make the best of it later.]

(;B[kn]TR[lo]C[This was overreaching a bit.  I should probably have played more solidly at say N5.

R: It certainly would have given you a chance to capture the two white stones and a chance of winning the bottom center.]
