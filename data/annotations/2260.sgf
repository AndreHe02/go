C[Comments along the way and a summary at the end marked by (magic):]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[cf];W[fd];B[dj];W[ic]C[(magic):
I feel that this is not optimal for two reasons:
1.: The stones at D16/F16 are aimed at influence, not territory. This stone is aimed at territory and strickes me as slow and inconsistent with the other stones.
2.: The high stone at Q6 doesn't work very well with this stone.

If you want to play in this region, then consider K16. Alternatively, play elsewhere (approach another corner)]
;B[jp];W[qn];B[ql]C[(magic):
This is reasonable play as it breaks up the white potential moyo and aims to use the black influence.]
;W[on];B[np];W[ol]C[(magic):
This may be overambitious by white. Also, this shape (P8, P6, R6) is weak and can be cut.]
;B[pj];W[rp]C[(magic):
White has changed his mind - not always a good sign. If you want to attck, then that is OK, but continue to do so. If you wanted to live on the spot, you should have done so straight away. In this area, it is likely that black will shut you in, which you should not allow.]
;B[qq];W[nc]C[(magic):
This is the wrong side. White has a nice dual-purpose move at R13 which extends from the corner and also takes away the base from the black group on the side. With this move, white is literally inviting black to stabilise his group by approaching the corner.]
;B[pf];W[qe];B[qf];W[cn]C[(magic):
This is reasonable.];B[cp];W[en]C[(magic):
Since you are in hostile territory, you may want to make a (little) base first by playing at C8 before you extend into the middle.]
;B[fp];W[gn];B[hp]C[(magic):
Black has done well here, and has literally created almost 60 points of territory on the bottom, and white has nothing to show for it but a string of loose stones.
By jealously trying to reduce the black moyo, white has actually helped him. White should try harder to increase his own territory instead of reducing blacks.]
;W[eg]C[(magic):
Locally, this is a good move.];B[ch];W[dg]C[(magic):
This is unnecessary. Save moves like this for later, when there may be better alternatives.]
;B[cg];W[fi];B[cl];W[ng]C[(magic):
The idea to create a large central moyo is a good one. However, white still has 2 strings of stones (lower left and lower right) which need to be connected up.

Furthermore, this stone is only losely connected to the upper right corner. If black choses to push and cut here, white will be left with a weak group and black can invade the upper side.]
;B[ph];W[nj];B[nh]C[(magic):
Black can cut there. but he would make a much stronger shape if he played at O11 instead.]
;W[mh];B[mi]C[(magic):
If black wants to cut he should play at O11, let white play at N11 and then chose to cut at N13 or N10. (N10 in this case)]
;W[ni];B[mj]C[(magic):
Black should connect at P12, let white put his cutting stone in atari and then place a ladder blocker at J7.]
;W[oh]C[(magic):
This is a bit of a disaster for black. White is connected and strong.

Black needs to think carefully about what to do with these stones now. White has a quite strong influence around, so any 'jiggling' he does is likely to be to white's advantage.  I think he should really look on the stones as aji and forget them for the time being.
Large areas which still need to be disputed is the upper centre. This may be the time to invade (deeply), indirectly using the proximity of the the 2 stones. It is difficult to choose the right spot, but I'd try with K17. If you can lean aginst the upper left, you should be able to get out, or even to connect with the stones at Q14.
Alternatively, both the upper sansan should be invadable, and the bottom left white group should be chased for profit.]
;B[lh]C[(magic):
This is wrong. Black will only strengthen white to the point where the top is closed off, and will probably end up with a weak group.]
;W[lg];B[kh]C[(magic):
This black shape has a major weakness at L10.];W[kg];B[jg]C[(magic):
With a weak group like this, black will be in trouble if white cuts.  A jump to e.g. J12 would be better.]
;W[jh];B[ji];W[ih];B[ii];W[hh];B[hi];W[gi];B[in]C[(magic):
Black just helped white to connect and made himself a weak group in the process of doing so.
Also, now that white has a wall facing the upper side, it has become much more difficult for black to reduce this moyo.
With the weak shape of the black stones, white can even push at M9 and L 9, making any black centre territory negligible, if he lives at all.

Last, this is the wrong direction to push white from. White will connect and strengthen himself, and black has not gained much. A play at e.g. G8 leaves much larger potential.]
;W[gl];B[il];W[gk];B[gj]C[(magic):
Now it is too late to cut.];W[fj];B[hj]C[(magic):
And you lose sente.];W[ek];B[cc]C[(magic):
Good. This is bigger than responding to the white move.];W[dc]
;B[cd];W[de];B[df]C[(magic):
This is small. White will respond and what might have been left for later has been used without profit. The aji of such a gap could have for instance halped an invasion.
Play elseswhere];W[ef];B[ce];W[ml]C[(magic):
This is the right idea. Plays by white here serve both to remove the black centre, but also to build strength which can be used to invade the bottom.]
;B[ll]C[(magic):
Black has a very weak shape here. White can push at N9 and M9 to cut off this stone, whilst staying firmly connectd to his own.]

;W[ro];B[qm];W[pn];B[rl];W[rq];B[qr];W[bl];B[bk];W[ck]C[(magic):
This leaves black to capture at B7 and undermine the entire white string.]
;B[cj];W[dk];B[bm];W[cm];B[al];W[dl];B[bl];W[jm]C[(magic):
Good. This black shape can, depending on the surrounding stones, be cut.]
;B[jl];W[im];B[hm];W[hn]C[(magic):
White has done well to cut off black, but in the processm has created a string of 4 stones which doesn't look to happy itself.   Can black be killed? Not straight away, I think, but maybe in a little bit....]

Close, but it doesn't work- See variation.]

Black can also invade sansan, I think.];W[rd];B[rf];W[pe];B[sd]
;W[sc];B[se];W[qc];B[kc]C[(magic):
This is a bit late for an invasion. It'll be tight, if possible at all.]
;W[jd]C[(magic):
This is the wrong direction. There is little point in capping him - he has nowhere to go already.]
;B[kd];W[ke];B[jc];W[ie];B[ib]C[(magic):
End of the game?
There are still some areas here which can be contested (such as this invasion).
If the invasion lives, black wins by about 45 points. If the invasion dies, if becomes a lot closer (20 points), and white may still get some points along the edges to make it close.

Summary:
You are both more focused on your opponents' territory than on your own. Try to win the game, not to make your opponent lose it.
Also, try to look a bit more at the overall board situation than at the local fights. There are often non-local moves which are bigger.
Last, but not least, play many game and have fun playing them.

Good luck.])
