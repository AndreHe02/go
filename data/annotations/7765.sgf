C[ericosman [1k\]: good morning !
jiangzhao [1d\]: hi
ericosman [1k\]: how's it going];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq]C[ericosman [1k\]: where's it going from ?
ericosman [1k\]: here is near BOSTON];B[fd];W[fc];B[gc];W[ec]
;B[gd];W[df]C[reid: This is usually considered a good result for white, so the high approach to the four-four (black F16) is rarely seen except in special situations.]
;B[kd]LB[ib:C][mc:B][nc:A]C[reid: There is still a lot of aji in the black position (white A, B, and C are all weak points).  In contrast, white's corner is pretty secure.]
;W[qf]LB[qn:B][nq:A]C[reid: Given the aji (see previous comments) I would rather approach the other black corner (with A or B) so black doesn't get a chance to fix his upper side position.]
;B[qh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og]C[ericosman [1k\]: in Amherst actually
ericosman [1k\]: about 100 mi away

reid: This joseki works well with the G16 stones, so black manages to catch up a little here.]
;W[nq];B[do];W[dl];B[eq];W[dp];B[eo]C[reid: Hmm, if black was worried about the cut, E3 is not the right way to start.  E5 is very inconsistant with E3.]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[fq];B[co];W[er];B[di];W[fi]LB[fl:A]C[reid:The cap is the standard way to attack a group, but in this case, white wants to attack two groups.  Jumping out with A is a nice splitting attack.]
;B[eg];W[ef];B[fg];W[dg]LB[fl:A]C[reid: White A is still more important than the turn, although it is not really a splitting attack anymore.]
;B[ek];W[el];B[fl];W[fm];B[dk];W[em]LB[gl:A]C[reid: Usually white wants to atari at A before making this connection.]
;B[go];W[hp]LB[hm:A]C[reid: White wants both!  Since the E2 group already has good eye shape, Jumping out with A seems better.  Of course, it is understandable that white wants to prevent black G3.  But black G8, white G7, black A could be trouble for white!]
;B[ho];W[gl]LB[hm:A]C[reid: Since white didn't make this atari earlier, it is better to not make it now.  Instead, simply jump to A.]
;B[fk];W[hm];B[io];W[hj];B[ei];W[fh];B[eh];W[hh];B[gg];W[hg]
;B[if]C[reid: This is an odd move for black.  White just pushes through.]
;W[hf];B[ff];W[ie];B[id];W[je];B[jd];W[jg];B[ip];W[pr];B[oq]
;W[or]LB[qq:A]C[reid: This is also strange for black.  The center is not a good place for territory since white has a nearly live group there.  And black is pushing white towards his weak J5 stones (no eyes there yet).

The standard block at A would be better.];B[np];W[mq];B[qq]
;W[qr];B[rq];W[qj];B[ql];W[rh];B[ri];W[qi];B[rg];W[qg];B[sh]
;W[ph];B[rj];W[rh];B[qk];W[mp];B[mo];W[lo];B[mn];W[nl]C[reid: White is ahead on territory, and he has no weak groups.  It is going to be difficult for black to make much progress now.]
;B[hq];W[no];B[op];W[nn];B[ln];W[pm];B[qm];W[pn];B[qo];W[ok]
LB[nj:B][oj:C][pj:A]C[reid: White's connection is not 100% here.  There is aji starting at black A.  It is OK now since there is a large white presence in the center, but white B or C looks a little better than P9.]
;B[km];W[lf];B[me];W[pb]LB[ch:B][bp:A]C[reid: White loses sente with this move.  Perhaps dropping down to R18 would let white get A or B.]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[bq]C[ericosman [1k\]: i see we played last october.  i tried to look at that game just now from archives but i see no text in it, only the moves.]
;W[cr];B[ch];W[bg];B[cg];W[bf];B[gb];W[oa];B[nb];W[na];B[ma]
;W[pa];B[mb];W[fb];B[ce];W[cf];B[fa];W[ea];B[kk];W[ga];B[ib]
;W[ia];B[ja];W[ha];B[hb];W[fa];B[ed];W[cc];B[bh];W[br];B[mf]
LB[pj:A]C[reid: Black's last chance seems to be the cut at A.  After this sequence, there is nothing left for black.]
;W[le];B[ld];W[mg];B[ng];W[mh]C[reid: Now white can connect P9 to either Q12 or N 12.

White has three and a half corners plus some center territory.  Even with no komi, white can justs wrap up the game now.

It seems white took an early lead in this game and black was never able to pull off an upset.  Perhaps black was putting too much stock in his upper territory which turned out to be smaller than white's two top corners.  Better to not put all your eggs in one basket.

I have not commented much on white, but I think the lesson in this game for white is the move at F11 which would be better of with a simple one point jump to F8.

Good luck,  play strong
