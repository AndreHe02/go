Exactly right.  There were lots of non-urgent times when instead of responding to your opponent, you should have played elsewhere.  When you choose to play elsewhere instead of answering your opponent, this is called a "tenuki".  It's a hugely important concept in Go. time you're thinking of a move, ask yourself what you would play if you decided not to answer your opponent's move.  In other words, "If I were to tenuki, where would I play?"  Then ask yourself which is bigger.  Weigh out each resulting position.  Do you like the one where he gets two local moves in a row and you get a big play and a response to his second local move?  Or is it really important to answer his local move immediately?  If you're not sure, for now it might be wise to choose the tenuki.

Many times, I've been in tournaments and been really nervous about playing some tenukis.  I'd tenuki and then watch a group become weak and die -- a group that I'd grown fond of.  But as the midgame comes, I would be very grateful for my tenukis.  I had the chance to play far more big moves than my opponent.  He has no chance!


By the way, you didn't play that openning corner badly at all.  If you had tenuki'd more, you'd definitely have won.

You are good and have lots of potential.  Keep working and studying :-)]

;B[ph];W[oh];B[pi];W[oi]C[Why this move?

At this point, he's crawling on the fourth row.  This is a big win for him.  Don't let him do it more!  You've already got a nice wall.  His move didn't threaten it.  Play elsewhere.  I really like building along the left side or breaking up his bottom side.]

Let's count territory first, cuz that's easiest.  I've marked what will become territory with squares.  His right side has 22.  Your top has 18.  Your right has 5.  His bottom-right has 14.   And he's got 9 more in the top-center.  That gives him an advantage of 22 points of territory.


Which is bigger, your top left corner or his bottom left?  Even with the conservative estimate I gave you with the squares on the right side, you have 24 compared to his 15.  There's lots of room for you to win this game.]
