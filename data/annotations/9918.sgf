C[Hello and thanks for reviewing the game.

I submitted it because my opponent was hyper aggressive and it left me flusted with no idea what to do, resulting in my losing soundly.

Hi Jon, I will review your game. I will put my comments under asterix like this one.]

This is not correct, because the jump is too far, leaving behind aji.]

This is ok. White really helped black with the R15 invasion. He got very little and black is all solid now. Still black is behind because of the corner.]

********
Ouch. Well, After losing a game or two, I like to take a break rather than "double down" so to speak. It helps to clear your head.

Generally speaking, you need to bring some your opponent's aggression to your game. You were correct to think that he was over-aggressive, but once that aggression puts him in a vulmenrable position, you must counter-attack. Your groups are stronger, and he will submit.

Major Mistakes:

- Not realizing you could connect below B8 for awhile - these two groups were comfortably connected, and the center group was not doing much for white.
- Move 37 cutting the top and the center was really crucial, but hard to see - it looks like you are giving up the corner, but because your counter attack on the center is so strong, its good.
- Cutting on the other side to live at 45 was the best way to live.
- Attacking the center went ok until around move 71 where you didn't push him in the right directions.
- Cutting the other way at the bottom would have been better for you.
- Black missed a large ko opportunity on the right side.


Good luck with your games!
