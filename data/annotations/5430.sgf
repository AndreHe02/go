hi, thanks for reviewing.

in this game i played as white.
there was a big mess at the beginning in the upper left corner, which i decided to leave as it is at a certain point to make some other moves on other parts of the board. rather out of frustration than because i saw no need to play there any more. when would have been the appropiate time to play tenuki?

after that i was rather successful making a big framework. how and when could black have prevented that? i mean which counterstrike might i would have to expect from a stronger player against that strategy?

allover the game:
big moves which should have been played instead of those played actually (from both sides)?
weaknesses in my walls and groups i should have defended?

my questions and comments are marked by "S". some of them are rather comments to myself as i went through the game again.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[op];W[cd];B[jj]
(;W[dj]TR[cd]C[S: doesn't fit well with the white stone in the upper left side...

J:looks awkward, but not nessesarily bad.  It would seem to expect the sequence i put down.  

My concern with d10 is it is not on the biggest side.  q10 may have been more appropriate for breaking up blackss moyo]

(;B[dc]C[J: Usual approach is E16 or E17];W[ee];B[fd]
(;W[cc]C[J:  I dont particularly like this move.  It seems to have a poor relation with E15.  Plus after black e16, it doesnt leave with a good sente sequence which is important for invading the right side. see avriation]
;B[ed]
(;W[gf]LB[dd:a]C[S: seems a bit greedy now. but i'd like to play a sente move.
better at A? (which is also sente? see variation)

J:  Theres an old go proverb that says the corner is golden, the sides are silver, and the center is a worthless peice of straw.  This seems to apply here.  g14 reaches for the center, is too loose (cause of E15) to make territory on the side]
;B[df];W[de];B[ff]C[J: see variations]
(;W[ef]TR[de][ee]C[J: This isnt a ver stong move, make sthe empty triangle (email me if you dont know this concept and ill explain it to you)  F15 is much stronger keeps black into two very weak groups while your is stong.]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[cf]
(;W[eh]C[J: this forces black to fix a weakness he want so its called a "Thank you move"  Black thanks you for playing it. see variation]
;B[fg];W[cg];B[bf]
(;W[be]C[J: B13 would ahve won the semai see variations];B[bg]
;W[ch];B[ce];W[dd];B[bd];W[ec];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]
(;W[bh]C[S: better at f15 to save the six stones. see variation.
there seem to be too many stones to sacrify them easily. (in fact i didn't see f15 at all!)

J: neither of you saw the bigger move of b17]
(;B[fe]
(;W[gc]C[S: that's when i began of thinking how to make profit of the remaining white stones to get strong on the outside.

J: Watch you stones d16 group is in atari again see variation]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[hc];W[gd];B[ge];W[hd];B[hb];W[gb];B[ie]C[S: which didn't work the way i imagined. so i abandoned that part of the board.

J: white can still be saved in the way I've already shown]
(;W[qp];B[id]C[J: this is huge for black];W[pl]LB[pn:a]C[S: too big an extension, as i suspect from the following? better a or something?

J:  Yes A or perhaps even R7 would work just fine];B[qo];W[pp]

(;B[pq]C[J: The black block at q5 is more standard see varaiation]

(;W[qq]C[J: Q5 is bigger, it cuts black into two weak groups]
;B[po]C[J:  notice now white is seperated into two weak groups]

(;W[pr]C[J: the atari at p3 is better];B[oq];W[or];B[rp];W[rq]

(;B[sq]C[S: misplay.

J: Yes =)];W[ro];B[so];W[rn];B[rm];W[sn];B[qn];W[sp];B[nr]C[J: thsi move is very slow for black, white should tenuki]

(;W[mr]C[S: originally i wanted to place some stones on the outside to form a group on the lower left side after an extension towards the left corner.
i was rather surprised of the possibility to connect to the right group.

J:  The right side is not nearly as big as blacks moyo, see variations]
;B[mq];W[ns];B[nq];W[lr]C[J: way to slow for white, the right side is begging for invasion =)]
;B[ps]C[J: pointless for black];W[qs];B[kq];W[hq]C[S: resuming the original plan to make an extension on the left side.

J: Big, but right side is bigger];B[kr];W[lp]C[S: the idea is letting white close me off and place stones to
get an influence toward that black stone at
 the tengen point.

J: overplay, m4 will be way to weak up agains blacks walkl after he plays m3, right side is still begging]
;B[lq];W[jo]
(;B[ls]C[J:  Very slow for black , he aslo should be looking towards the right, either defend the cut or pincher]
;W[ir]LB[hk:a]C[S: i happily gave the two stones away to make a move on the outside to secure the influence. perhaps better at a point like A?

J: j2 is way to slow, yes A would be better, but nothing like whats on the right]
;B[js]C[J: thsi move was the equivilat of a pass by black =)]
;W[is]C[S: rather small. same for black's response.

J: as is that move for white];B[jr]C[J:  Black passes again]
;W[rl]C[S: i thought of making first a move here in order to make an extension to the upper side after black's answer.
unfortunately the move seems to be gote.

J: good, not as good as the cut at r7 but it does connect];B[ql]
;W[qk];B[qm];W[rj];B[rr]
(;W[qr]C[S: necessery move to protect half of the white group. but nevertheless to small?

J: not at all, s2 was a pointless move my black but it was sente, the end result was a sif he had never played at all]
;B[ms];W[qf]C[at last.

J: YES lovely extension (and I agree "at last")];B[os];W[ns]
;B[os]C[J: so slow...];W[nd]C[J: good];B[qe];W[pf]TR[rj][qk]
[pl][rl]C[S: not at all sure about these following moves. but the most important to me seemed to shut black off in the corner or at least at the upper side and get a solid wall towards the center to make a group with the marked stones. perhaps even using the aji of the stones in the upper left.

J: well said and q14 is very consistent with thos ideas];B[re]
;W[rf];B[oc];W[oe];B[od];W[ne];B[nc]
(;W[lg]TR[hb][hc][id][fe][ge][ie][ff][eg][fg]C[S: making a wall of the planned territory against the marked black stones.
any major problems the black stone at the tengen point could make as beginning of an invasion into the right and/or lower left side?

J:  M13 is a bit of an awkward move, it doesnt surround much aas black can reduce,  surround the marked stone sdoesnt do much saince their alive (although if you noticed, the d16 group can still be saved.  if your worried about an invasiion play H9 instaed of m13, that a move you were looking at earlier anyway.]
;B[he]C[J: Here black fixed a problem with his aji, i didnt mention it before because its very complicated but ill show you the start.  Lets see ehat happens if white plays there.]
;W[ke];B[hg];W[hi]C[S: thought to make pressure from the other side and thus securing the lower left side. which didn't work out very well.

J: your original idead of H9 would ahve been fine for securing that side.]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[fh]
(;W[ei]LB[fj:a]C[better at A?];B[gk]
(;W[fk]C[J: H10 would have sufficed, keeping black seperated]
;B[fj];W[hj];B[fl];W[ek];B[el];W[dl];B[hk]
(;W[im]C[J: doesnt do much , an iron pillar at c4 looks well here instead, the cut at g8 also works]
;B[hm];W[gm]C[J: overplay by white, iron pillar again is recommended]
;B[hn]C[J: good response by black, keeps white seperated];W[gn]
;B[go];W[fo];B[gp];W[fq];B[gq];W[gr];B[fp];W[eq];B[fn]C[J:  all this results fromthat overplay]
;W[eo];B[fm];W[en]C[S: well, at last the left side is more or less blocked off with a white wall.

J: true, but you'd have gained more with my variation];B[iq]
;W[nl]C[S: off to the right side to enlarge territory here! especially neutralizing the massive black wall in the lower right side.

J: Good tenuki, J2 is small];B[cq]
(;W[dq]C[S: any better ideas for a defence of the corner? at the end the group is alive but very small. so it seems to be tolerable to me.
i play at d3 because i feared that black might be able to connect to his stones on the outside. see variation.

J:  D3 is too conservative see variation];B[cp];W[co];B[dr]

(;W[er]TR[hq][gr][ir][is]C[S: played to protect the white stones on the right from getting cut off.]

(;W[bs];B[cs];W[lk];B[kl];W[ll];B[lm];W[mm];B[ln];W[mn];B[jm]
;W[jh];B[in];W[jg]C[S: that's when i had used up my 30 mn and began playing in overtime. normally i'm earlier in overtime than my opponents but i consider the beginning as the most important part of the game and so tend to spend some time on the moves there. on the other hand my moves up from here might be sometimes played rather as a result of intuition than that of reading the board because of the lack of time.
are there any general guidelines how to use your time? i suppose it's for the most part a matter of personal taste, isn't it?

J:  Ill keep that in mind, as far as time management goes, Illl include that in my speil at the end.]
;B[ih];W[ji]TR[hi][gj][hj]C[S: treating the marked stones lightly to make a solid wall.]
;B[ii];W[kj];B[jk]C[J:  Good plan , the wall is worth more than the stones, plus you have f11 to save thewm at any time]
;W[fi]C[J: and there it is =)];B[gh];W[kc];B[kd];W[ld];B[jd]
;W[le];B[oi]C[S: the invasion which i awaited.
seems hard to me for black to make life here? any possibilites he could have made it?

J: None, he has no base, he has no stones he could lionk to and you are thick all around him.  A 9d couldnt make life in there (of course if a 9d says he can beleive himover me lol)]

(;W[dk];B[gj];W[ig]C[S: waste of move?
i think i was getting nervous to overlook some problems the dead black stones on the right might make, so i tried to connect some of my stones.

J:  Ok, now my speil.  As with most low Kyu players it seems you know what you want to do but lack the experience to read out sequences that would acoomplish your goals (case in point when you tried defending the lower left)  Low kyus also ahyve a tendincy to follow their opponent and play in areas that were just played, like around j1 and j2.  Now you did have a couple nice tenukis and you responded well to blacks overplays on the right.  

On the upper left you asked when awas a good time to tenuki, and as I pointed out numerous times throughou tthe game you tenukied way to early, you could ahve saved the whole group in sente.

Your other question was about the frame workyou made on ther right.  Ill be honest,  a stronger player would have prevented it by either defending the cut or pinchering as I pointed out in move 68.  

And your last question was about time managment.  When you play with a clock it is reaaly easy to learn mistakes.  Overplays may work because your opponent is under simialr constraints but unfortunatly you won't learn much and you may even condition yourself to make the same mistakes.  When your trying to learn ,play slow games.  (Only advice, you dont have to listen =)) If you are playing with strict constraits , id say if you dont find a decent move in one minute tenuki, play somewhere else, but once again this is only advice.  

It aslo seems you shouldpratcice your life and death problems (Ie the lower left)  I reccomend www.goproblems.com.  that site helped me a lot when i was low kyu

Well thats it for the review, I hoped it helps and any questions or thoughs, feel free to email me (sleep667@yahoo.com) or lookme up on kgs (sleep667)
Good luck (if your interested apply for the shodan challange, it offers a lot of tools for players to improve but he deadline is coming up fast on nov.15)
