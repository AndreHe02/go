AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

I was black in this game, where I felt quite happy until I found myself behind in the end :)

Considering this is a handicap game, there must be several mistakes. I would be happy if you could highlight them !

Thanks !

Hagios: I'll do my best to help point out areas that need work.]

H: Either of these look like B is building a very big moyo, but it's too thin.

You should compare how solid W's territory is, and choose your strategy accordingly.  I prefer A.]

H: The left has two low stones, A and B.  Tending to your potential territory is bigger than keeping W pressed low on the left.  This doesn't enlarge your moyo much, because of the influence of C.]
;W[qd]LB[pb:B][pc:A]C[H: I wouldn't have played here.  I'd prefer to play at A or B.  This way lets B solidify some cash , rather than stealing the top, then aiming at q10 later.]

H: Overall, you played a bit too passively.  You needed to:

think a little deeper about the relative value of areas early on
avoid playing passive sequences as in the bottom-right area
make absolutely sure that a fighting move or trade is the correct idea at the time, as with the f10 connection, or the fight in the upper side.]
