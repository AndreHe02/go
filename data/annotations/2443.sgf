C[Hi!
My name is Peter. You asked for a review for White. White won this game, so I will show you where Black could've played better. I think, this is the best way to look at weak white moves, although it may seem, I do a review for Black.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[de]LB[dc:B][ec:A][pe:F][qe:E][op:D][oq:C]
C[The black stone in the upper right corner stands on the third line. By this move you invite Black to play the kakari at A or B, getting a good position on the upper side.
So I would prefer A or B myself.
But also there is the kakari at C or D, very attractive points to Black. If Black takes the upper left corner in return, you still have a kakari left at E, F or in the upper left. I think, Black should play at C now.]
;B[fc];W[op]C[Good, but Black had the chance.];B[pq];W[dc]LB[oq:A]
C[Not now. First stretch out at A. If Black does, White's position is bad. See variation.]

(;W[jp]LB[on:C][qn:B][oq:A]TR[jp]C[As said before, better first play at A. Without that move your lower side is still open for Black.
You can play the marked stone right after Black connected at B.
If he fails to do so, you have a nice attack at C for yourself. See variation.]
;B[dh];W[cg];B[ch]
(;W[lc]LB[md:A][cf:B]C[Too many weak groups now. First there is the cutting point at A, creating two white groups to look after. Then there are two black stones on the left which desire an extension down the side and have an attacking point at B. See variation.]

(;B[jc];W[le]LB[md:A]C[Better at A, because the cutting point there still exists.]
