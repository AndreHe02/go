*donapeanut*: Hi


Hi, please review for the black side.
The game was close until the early endgame and i started not to read so well and played some bad moves.

please help
i'm interested in the opening theory and any joseki choices.

as well as any big reading errors i made.

many thanks,
neil

Hi Neil,

Thanks for sending this game to me for review.  To be honest I found it very hard to review as your playing style is quite different to mine.  I have prefixed my comments with --

I would have pincered Q5 as per the normal mini-chinese.];W[ee]

This fuseki is very complicated!  3 unresolved corners makes it very hard to determine priorities and assess implications.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq]C[mybe i should play e3 or d3 instead?
--
It depends what your plan with Q3 is.  This sequence finishes with white F2 and you are left with some aji in F3 and G4, so you could perhaps use that in conjunction with the N3 joseki.

E3 would instead give you a move around K4 but that would cost you sente and enable white to wrap up the lower right.  

I think I would have chosen this move.];W[eq];B[cp];W[fr];B[qr]
;W[qp];B[mq];W[kq];B[or];W[cl];B[bm]C[--
I find moves like this hard.  If you can live without it then it's almost always worthwhile because it enlarges your corner so little.  However reading out the tsumego is tricky and I'm not sure I could get it correct.

White could start with D2, B5 or B6.

D2 pretty much forces a reply since you can't threaten to escape and white can follow-up with B2.

B6 is gote since B6, B5, B7, and that would enable you to play say b3

B5 seems the hardest: B5, C5, B6, B4, B7, B2?

So if white initially exchanges D2 for C2 then plays B5 you get dead shape:
D2, C2, B5, C5, B6, B4, B7, B2? A3, A4, C1, B1, A2

You could maybe answer D2 at B1

D2, B1, B5, C5, B6, B4, B7, A2? Seems alive... Hmmm, no... White simply plays C2 and B2 becomes a false eye.  Ok, I guess B7 is forced.

Anyway if it were me I'd try hard to find a living sequence because I wouldn't want to have to play B7.A move such as R9 is much bigger.]

If the whole upper left dies then sure.  White has barely 70 including komi while you have 40 + the upper left (40+).]

I'm not entirely convinced H18 is that devestating.  There's obviously the ko at E17 if you need it and you have quite a few ko threats, or you can connect at E17, allow H18 to live and cut at H16.  That makes the top more than 10 smaller which might put white slightly into the lead but it should still be winnable.]

I think you're a few points behind.  White should win, but you want to be in a position that a small yose mistake by white gives you the win.]

where did i go wrong?
--
I've tried to answer this as best as I can throughout the game.  I felt you got behind initially and then caught up suddenly when white mishandled the invasion around F14, losing the entire corner in exchange for preventing you reducing the left side.

Then white stole a bit of the corner back with H18 after you made a small mistake, and at that point you would need to have pushed very hard to win.  I felt your moves after H18 were not as sharp as they were before H18, I think a strong yose from there could well have given you the game.

I have not particularly commented on the fuseki except to observe moves I personally would not have played.  It was a complicated fuseki and I suspect any advice I give would be too likely to be incorrect.]

Technically you do not have to answer this, the upper right is unconditionally alive if I'm reading it correctly due to the extra liberty at Q13.  

Although of course it is quite costly to ignore.
