C[This is a game that i played and lost real quick. I seem to lose many games like that these days, by overlooking influence, and not being able to invade.

I think it must be one of the following explanations :

- I'm really bad at fuseki
- I don't know how to chose josekis
- I don't know the josekis
- I don't know how to invade a moyo, and i consider too often that an invasion is impossible
- I do not tenuki often enough.

please tell me what are the most obvious defaults in my game, and how i can stop losing games by 50 points, against people that have the same rating as I]

-No rush, at this stage in the game its just a matter of choosing which move suits your play style]

(;W[lq]C[the pincer seems to me like the only way to prevent a huge black moyo on the low part. Is it a good idea ? Should i have played a further pincer ? (L4?)
