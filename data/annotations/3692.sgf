C[Hello! Thanks for reviewing my game. I was white and my main problem is finding the big points in the opening and the right points and timing for invasions/reductions.

pajaro: Hi. I'll do my best to point out mistakes and suggest alternative lines of play. I'll review for white, but I'll also add comments for black when suitable. I'll start my comments as pajaro.]
;B[pp];W[pd]C[AKAI0 [15k\]: onegaishimasu];B[dq];W[dd]
(;B[jp]C[pajaro: Perhaps a shimari might be better.];W[co];B[jd]
;W[ep]C[I'm not sure if this is the correct response for white if black ignores the approach!?

pajaro: It looks ok. Pressing towards the bottom and making that side hard to develop. Also, white has D16, so a moyo in the left is possible.]
;B[fq]C[pajaro: A mistake. Leaving E3 open calls for white to play there.]
;W[eq];B[er]
(;W[cq]C[At this time I thought it's a good moment to seize the corner

pajaro: No good. Black will not lose the corner and white loses a good chance to damage black. Consider D2 or F2. See vars.]
;B[cr]C[pajaro: Right. Black defends his position. The loses are small.]
;W[dp];B[dr]
(;W[bq]C[Even though this move seems to be quite small in the opening i thought it was necessary to make a base now.

pajaro: This move is small. Black is already stable, so playing B3 is also slow for black. Playing were your opponent wouldn't play is usually bad. Instead, white should take sente and build s moyo on the left.]

(;B[gp]C[pajaro: this is slow too. The E2 stones are safe too, so better take sente and play elsewhere.]
;W[dj]C[Trying to build a framework on the left side.

pajaro: Right but a bit late.];B[pj];W[lc]C[I wasn't so sure where to play at this state of the game but I thought fortifying Q16 is a good idea.

pajaro: Agree. This is the only enemy group that you can attack. The black moyo is quite big, but white can still invade (R3, for example). Also, Q16 is the weakest white stone, so it is a good idea to reinforce it.]
;B[qc]C[I think it's too early for black's 3-3 invasion, am I right?

pajaro: Right. White will get thickness, useful in the future.]
;W[pc]C[Was this the right direction?

pajaro: I think so, towards M17. But perhaps, building towards the bottom, aiming to invade might be ok too.]
;B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[rh];W[rg];B[sg]C[pajaro: this exchange can be omitted now. White loses a liberty. With that liberty, black can't cut at Q15. Now, the cut is possible.]

(;W[qb]C[Is this move "big" enough at this stage?

pajaro: I don't think so. After a 3-3 invasion, you should expect the invader to be confined. Black is out in S12, crawling along the second line. Punish him there. See var.]
;B[rb];W[pb]
(;B[sa]C[Is there a reason for playing this move, wouldn't S17 be the standard reply?

pajaro: This move is bad. A missclick? Wanted it to be S19? Anyway, black should play R12.]
;W[og]C[Preventing the cut at Q15.

pajaro: R12 prevents it too. But you wouldn't need to play this without the S13-T13 exchange.]
;B[nq]C[pajaro: Very good. The bottom starts looking black.]

(;W[pm]C[I'm trying to restrict black's framework on the right side. I was afraid of being trapped in when playing on the third line. Is this the right point to invade?

pajaro: It is hard for me to say. Q7 will probably escape, but there are other standar points. See vars. I don't put any continuations, as I'm not sure, but any of them should live, although black would get solid territory in exchange.]
;B[hc]C[pajaro: Too shy. I black wants to play there, play F17, or make a bigger extension. If not, attack Q7.]
;W[nm]C[Giving the invading group a little more space seemed to be a good idea for me.

pajaro: Yes. Black lost a chance.];B[cc]C[Again I think the 3-3 invasion is reasonable here since it gives white the chance to build up a huge framework on west.

pajaro: Yes. Black shows little imagination.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec]
C[Maybe this move was a little too aggressive. If white cuts at E16 things will get complicated

pajaro. Maybe. Playing E16, while building a moyo, seems enough, and a lot safer.]
;B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb];W[hd]
(;B[ic]C[pajaro: Black is so kind. He could play J16.]
(;W[ch]C[Here I'm trying to transform my framework on the west into territory after checking that the cuts at E16 and G16 don't work.

pajaro: F10 or F6, in a larger scale, might be better.];B[rm]
C[pajaro: Bad. Black wants to protect an area that can't be territory. Or else, he wants to rob a base that white hadn't. For white, jumping to the center is safe enough.]
;W[nj]C[Was this the right way to attack or would have R9 with the intent to separate black's stones been better?

pajaro: Actually, white has no target to attack. He has strong positions at Q4 and S12. Rather, white should try to enlarge his moyo on the left, or reduce black's on the bottom.]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[qi];B[ri];W[qj]C[This move was too aggressive as I will see later, maybe connecting with R12 would have been better.

pajaro: Playing in that area is small. White can't get points there, and black could get very little, even if white doesn't play there. Always try to play in the most interesting areas.]
;B[qh];W[ph]C[I already assumed that the R10 group will die, therefor i was trying to connect O10 to the rest of the east group

pajaro: Actually, white could play Q11 and escape.];B[pi];W[rj]
C[By threatening T11 i can keep the stones temporarily alive to be used for some Ko threats

pajaro: If you want to use these stones as ko threats, you are losing the first. If you don't play S10 and black wastes a move to capture them, you gain a move, which is more than expected.]
;B[sh];W[sf]C[Trying to brake black's eye shape.

pajaro: Another lost ko threat.];B[se];W[sj]C[I think this was a wasted move I should have saved it for later]
;B[rd];W[oi]C[Fortunately black didn't play P12 so I can seal the 4 black stones in]
;B[ql];W[qm];B[rn];W[fj]C[Trying to expand the framework on the east. Was there another big move I should have played instead?

pajaro: This is a good move. Again, you could have played it a lot earlier.]

(;B[sc]C[pajaro: Is this needed? See the var.];W[fp];B[gr]C[pajaro: Shy. H4 is enough.]
;W[ok]C[This wasn't really necessary here, should I have played N5 or M15 or the center star point or something else?]
;B[jj]C[pajaro: The center will be worth very few points. You can't build anything there, you aren't attacking anuthing. This is because black is strong at the top and bottom, white is at left and right. Playing there is worth nearly 0.Better, reduce white's moyo.]

(;W[ge]C[Now it's time to protect the cut at E16 because the black stone is a ladder breaker

pajaro: H14 is good too, and helps more your moyo.];B[ed];W[ee]
;B[jm]C[pajaro: black defends a worthless stone.];W[fm];B[gh]
;W[ih]C[I think black's stone was placed too deep inside my framework therefore I played the cap

pajaro: Not that inside. Black could attach J12 and escape, probably.]
;B[jh];W[ig];B[kf]C[pajaro: Black has got what he wanted. He has joind the top and the bottom with a chain of stones placed in no-man's land. That's a big loss.]
;W[me];B[jg];W[if];B[hj];W[hi];B[ii];W[gj];B[gi];W[hh]C[pajaro: With the last few moves, black has forced white to strengthen his moyo, already territory. Say thanks.]

(;B[oo]C[Playing O6 and cutting would have been a lot better for black

pajaro: Not sure. White could fight a bit, sacrifice some stones, and reduce black. See var for some possibilities.]
;W[nn];B[np];W[lo];B[lp];W[qq]C[Is the 3-3 invasion still possible at this stage? If so how does it work?

pajaro: You should die for sure.];B[qp];W[rq];B[pq];W[pr]C[I think this was the wrong move. Could the group have lived with S4?]

;W[mo];B[lk]C[This move is quite big so I'm wondering if protecting the stone at M5 in the last move was correct

pajaro: It is not that big. black can't play P10 (white S8 is atari), so he can't cut, and white can play L8.]
;W[mk];B[lj];W[kl]C[pajaro: Yes. Black won't make may points there.]

;W[id];B[je];W[ka];B[ja];W[mc];B[kk]C[pajaro: Wrong. White can play L11, so black protects no points there.]

;B[cb];W[ha]C[I should have taken the Ko at L6 and saved this move as a Ko threat unfortunately I was in time trouble.]
