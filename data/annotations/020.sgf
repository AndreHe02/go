;B[de]L[jd]C[MG:  Black almost always plays a pincer or extends along the upper side here.


The Black attachment from komoku is not usually good unless Black already has several stones on the side to make use of the nice thickness he makes.


There are two drawbacks to this attachment:  (1)  Black's corner is too small to justify (2) White's settling his group so easily.  Compared to the tsukenobi joseki from hoshi, Black has at least four points less.

Still, if there were a stone at 'a', this would be playable.];W[df];B[ee]
;W[cd]L[qo][cc]C[b should complete the joseki in upper left corner (variation B)]

(;B[qo]L[op][dd][cc][fc]C[MG:  Black should have finished the joseki in the upper left corner, but White can't ignore this move because Black 'a' is sente (given the D4 hoshi), works perfectly with the Q16 hoshi, and makes the tobi at E15 shine.


If White tries to punish the tenuki by playing 'b', Black can handle himself with variation B.


If I could talk myself into playing here, though, I'd play 'c' and attack at 'd' later.]

(;W[pl];B[qq];W[qr];B[pp]L[oq][rq]C[MG:  It is more usual for White to atari at 'b' instead of extending.  White can force this variation to his advantage (see variation B).]

(;W[oq]L[op][rq]C[B b (s3) is the usual joseki so that b can get good shape and take sente (variation B)]

(;B[op];W[nq];B[np];W[mp]L[pi][mo]C[B b (n5, variation B) is the usual move in this shape]

(;B[pi];W[mo];B[om]L[cc][pj]C[B p7 looks good even though w can escape (variation B)]

(;W[cc]L[ol][pj][qf][qe][pf][nd][ri][rq][fq][fp]C[W c17 very big but this is risky if B later finds the time to play a (p8)


MG:  Actually, it looks to me that White's played the vital point (remember the tenuki so long ago?) -- if Black pushed at 'a', I imagine that 'b' would suffice.


Rather than answer directly, though, I'd probably later kakari at 'c' and aim at a slide to 'g'.  (It's not clear whether this is the best way to deal with the Black moyo.  Any 7-dans have an opinion?)


Back to the right side. . . .  Consider the exchange made in the lower right:  White has at least 10 points (plus a great extension/approach to 'i' or 'j' if he grabs sente), Black maybe 20 points when he plays 'a' and takes gote; this doesn't seem bad for White.  'h' may be sente for White later; Black probably won't bother with it.]
;B[ef];W[dg];B[id]L[jd][dd][ed][ec][fc]C[b j16 might be better at a (k16), because j16 might end up too close to the e15 group
if w later captures the d17 stone (W b, B c, W d, B e, etc...)];W[nc]L[pf][lc][db]C[b might make a pincer at b immediately (variation B)

MG:  And later aim at 'c' or building his moyo.]
(;B[pf]L[lc]C[MG:  Playing the pincer at 'a' immediately might be better here.]
;W[pb]C[MG:  Jumping into the 3-3 point would be better if Black allows White to connect outside, but this may add unnecessary complications (the timing of plays on the right side and top might be rather close).]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[qd]M[pf]C[now the B marked stone (q14) is not ideally placed]
;W[fq]L[dn][oc]C[B could also consider closing off the center (variation B) but I'm not sure which is better]

(;B[dn]L[cn][cl]C[MG:  Having chosen to play in this corner and leave closing the top for later, Black should consider playing 'a' to keep White from making the really great move at 'b'.]
;W[ne];B[ng]L[ol]C[since the w corner is safe, b o13 might be better at a (P8) to ensure the capture of q8. b o13 would work best only if it were sente against the w corner.


MG:  True.  But with the Q11 stone on Q10 hoshi, O13 is a useful moyo-building move in many positions, though it seems wasted here.]
;W[pj];B[nj]L[qi][nk]C[w could also escape instead of living inside (variation)


MG:  Since White can escape or live rather easily, I'd sagari to 'a', taking profit and reducing White's eye space.  White will almost certainly jump into the center.]

(;W[qi];B[qh];W[qk];B[ri];W[rj];B[rh]C[I think it is generally recommended to take the ko once before defending.]
;W[oi];B[ph]M[pf]C[b becomes overconcentrated (q14 too close to black wall)]
;W[oj];B[ni]L[nk]C[b o11 does not achieve much once w exits at a (o9)]
;W[nk];B[ol];W[ok];B[rr]L[rq]C[B s2 is probably an overplay (see variations later)


MG:  Black sets up the ko as an emergency measure to live (or if he's playing lightly early in the gaame).  The simple extension at 'a' is honte.]
;W[rq];B[qp]L[or][sr][rp][mq]C[I think that w can play variation B


MG:  If Black isn't willing to play the ko at 'c', he shouldn't even think about the hane.  (Yes, there is cutting aji at 'd', but this sort of cut-and-slash Go is usually quite bad unless a workable sequence has been read out first.)]

(;W[or]C[MG:  White should be glad to grab the offered stone and chip away at Black's eye space.]
;B[rp];W[rs];B[rl]M[mo][mp]L[hq][cj][nn][go][cl][dm][ck]
[hp][dq]C[s8 ended up eaten by white since W q7 is sente. black might instead invade at a or extend at b.

MG:  Black has to look after the life of his group: 'c' looks interesting.


Because of the marked stones, Black should be _very_ careful about invading inside or near the line between F3 and N5 (just a rough guide, but playing within requires careful reading).  You might consider something like 'd'.


Also, the D13/14 stones are quite strong and you don't want to approach them too closely.  A play at 'b' demands a response at 'e' or 'f'.  Normally the appropriate extension toward such strength is 'g', but then White will probably invade at the 3-3 point.


As Black, I'd play 'e'.  If White answers at 'h', closing the corner at 'i' is huge (settling the left side comes next).]
;W[ip]L[dr][cj]C[B b (variation) might be better than a, but I'm not sure.


MG:  When faced with a choice of enclosing the corner or extensing up the side, closure is usually correct.  As soon as someone extends, your first thought should be to invade at the 3-3 point (close to being miai).]

(;B[dr]L[cj];W[cl]C[MG:  Yes!  Make full extensions from your strength.  (The proverb saying you should play away from strength works both ways.)]
;B[cm]L[fo][co][hq][em]C[MG:  This is a bad move.  It makes White 'a' sente (White 'a' prevents the invasion at 'c' and aims at the cover of 'd'.]
;W[dl];B[le]L[di][hq][eb][bl]C[A black attack around a, an invasion at b or a defense at c seem more profitable since B m15 is not sente against the W corner.

MG:  Agreed!  'd', which protects against the aji there, is also big.];W

;W[mj]L[gc][bo][cq]C[I think that W N10 could be at a. W has threats at b, c, etc... (threatening life in the corner). However N10 and M9 remove any pressure against the W group and prepare for a center territory.]
;B[mi];W[lk];B[hq]L[gc][fh]C[B h3 good but the cut at a is bad aji. B b is also large (threatens invasion
on left side).];W[hp];B[gs]L[iq][gr][gq]C[B g1 nice idea but W can capture H3 (variation B)

MG:  'c' is the usual continuation, with Black connecting to the corner.]

(;W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[sq]M[rl]L[qm][fh]C[B a probably bigger locally since it saves the marked stone. But B b is globally
much larger.];W[eg]C[W e13 very big.];B[fg];W[fh];B[gg]L[gh][ff][fd]
