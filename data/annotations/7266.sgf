C[Dear reviewer,
In this game I played as White.
The game was played on the OGS.
I would especially like if You could point out  the opening mistakes.
Also I would appreciate You comments on my M3 invasion.
In the end I won by 6.5, mostly because I played better endgame I think.
Thanks for the review in advance.

SZ: My comments are marked SZ, where your comments are present.]

SZ: Overconcentrated and too soft. Jump at A is vital here. With the jump, you don't just defend - you e.g. prepare invasion to R14.]
BM[1];B[oh];W[nc]LB[pc:A]C[If black just defends at A, he gets big territory. Moreover, he will get sente to fix bottom.]

;B[oc]C[Okay, let's stop here for a moment and evaluate the game a bit.
T-top, L-left, R-right
B-bottom

W has :

10+ in TL
15+ in BL
5+ on R side
5 in TR
6.5 komi for a total of cca 45pts.

all W groups are safe, there are some weaknesses on left side.

B has:
5 on L side
10 on top
10 on bottom left
15 on bottom right
for a total of 30 pts.

The bottom is still open but can be closed with 1 move at L4, which is very big. W needs sente to attack at K3.

So,  W is having more safe points, but if B gets sente to L4, it will be difficult again for W. Moreover, B center potential looks terrifying.]

[fc][lq][lp][gr][iq]C[Pity, should have peeped.

Overall, I can't emphasize enough to:

1) Look at a value of a move - 4 points, 10 points? Don't be afraid to tenuki.

2) Look at aji - conserve opponents weaknesses and strike when ready!

3) Take care of your shape - you made some moves which made you ineffective or weak or you missed the vital point - marked. Especially the bottom group, which could have cost you the game.

Anyway, was a gg, hope this review helps a bit :-).
