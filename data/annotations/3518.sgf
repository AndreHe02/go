C[jackiechen: I played black in this game on IGS.
I'd like to know what's my weakness and how to improve it.
Thanks for taking time to review my game.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[qk];W[mp];B[po];W[jp];B[fc];W[hc]C[I would rather just play D14, but I cannot really say the pincer is bad.]

(;B[cc]C[Jackiechen: Is this the right direction?
 Or should I just play at F14 ?

Well, this is the normal move and I don't see why it should be bad in this situation.
F15 (see variation) is also a joseki move, but a difficult one (for both sides) as far as the follow-up moves are concerned. 
I haven't seen F14 in this position - are you sure you didn't mean F15?]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]C[Well, I would be happy with the result.]
;W[qm]LB[nc:A][eg:B][ch:C]C[Jackiechen: Is this overplayed ?

Well, the invasion is not impossible (black cannot capture the stone), but this is definitely not a move to play in this position. There are many "normal" fuseki moves to play before white should plunge in that deeply. 
In the upper left, there are B and C which are more or less sente, but I am not sure which is more important. Therefore, I would just play A myself.

So I would not exactly call it an overplay, but just a plain bad move :-)]
;B[qo]C[Jackiechen: Is it better to play at Q7 ?

No! You want to punish white, so you must attack. R5 looks right.]
;W[qj]C[Your opponent is trying to confuse you ...];B[pk]C[Jackiechen: Is this the right answer here ?

I think so - you get strong and white is separated. This must be good for black.

R8 would just help white. 

S9 would be another posibility, but Q9 looks better.];W[rk]
;B[rl];W[rj];B[rm]C[R8 is the correct shape. S7 leaves some bad aji at R8.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[I would rather play R15 first to make white overconcentrated.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[lc];B[ne]C[Is this too defensive?
Should I play at K17?

The answer to the first question is yes.
I'm not sure about the second question, but I would rather play K17 than O15. You may also play tenuki.]
;W[jd]C[Well, this shape looks strange. I would prefer white M15.]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[ch];B[ck]C[I would rather answer at C13. The peep at B15 is severe.]
;W[be];B[ce];W[bf];B[cg];W[bg];B[dh];W[ci];B[fb]C[This looks like an overplay. If black cannot capture white (and I don't think this is possible ...) he just gets two weak groups. 
I think E14 is the correct shape. You have to strengthen your group before trying to fight.
Don't be concerned about F17 now. If white captures it, he just gets overconcentrated. If he doesn't, there is aji for later in the game. Be patient!

But the situation is already difficult after B15.];W[fa];B[fe]

;B[jf];W[le];B[lf];W[rc];B[me]C[Is O3 better ?

What is the purpose of N15? If you want to connect, N14 is the proper move. If you are looking for a big point, C3 looks very big.]
;W[ke];B[mg]C[Just playing N14 would have been better. Now there is bad aji at L14/K13!]
;W[en];B[fl]C[I was afraid of the cut on D9.

Yes, the cut is possible now. But I am not sure how to answer E6. The combination D19/B16 makes live in the upper left corner and is also rather big. 

You could also play C3. But this would have the drawback that B16 may become sente later on ...]
;W[gm];B[cq];W[mn];B[mr];W[lq];B[lr];W[kq];B[jr]C[I think this is a bad move because it is gote. L2 is smaller but sente.]

Yes, it doesn't give away 3 stones (=6 points). This is four times the points you needed in the end ...]
