C[Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game and lost by a wide margin. The main points I would like to get your help on are related to reading the overall board situation and the middle game. I appreciate if you phrase your inputs such that they may be useful for future game - not just to the specific point in this game.
Thanks a lot!

Hi,

In general I think the main thing you should focus on is your strategy in fighting.  Your ideas are good -- keep your opponent separated, keep them from forming bases, etc.  But you need to work on the flow, timing, and direction of your attack.  Don't just instinctively give up territory to keep some opponent's stones from having a base unless you have a clear attack on them that will _definitely_ result in one of the following: you gaining territory while attacking, or you killing the attacked stones.  It is often better to force your opponent to make a connecting move in gote while taking territory and keeping sente, then to cut him off in gote and chase after him across neutral territory - or worse, into your own.  

Ideally, you should learn how to attack in ways that force your opponent to induce you to make the moves you want to make (see comments on move 41, for example), rather than just making those moves first.  Make sure you think about exactly _how_ the attack will benefit you before you begin -- this will help you decide the direction and method of attack.  

Your opening was good and your overall aims very smart -- you just need to work on your actual techniques and the principles of fighting to back them up.  

Hope this helps!];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[cp];B[ep];W[eq];B[dp]
C[A: May be F3 is better for this position, to work togetehr with Q4.

--> Yes, definitely.];W[dq];B[co];W[bq];B[bp];W[cq];B[fp];W[gq]
;B[dj]C[A: Is this way of playing OK so far? I prefered to leave some weakness at B5 and D5 rather than let White take this point.

--> The way of thinking is very understandable.  The only questionable aspect here is that you traded territory for influence, but that influence has lots of holes -- holes that white can exploit in sente.    If white gets greedy and invades right away you can happily use your strength to fight, but here patient white gets a nice shimari at c13, so that 1) your influence won't help you attack, and 2) white looks forward to many ways of invading or reducing.]
;W[cg];B[mc]C[A: May be C11 is required to ensure some territory and also threaten C15?

-->No, that is too small, plus you still have openings on the side.  Your move is much better.  q10 area also playable.]
;W[pj];B[qm];W[qf];B[qh]C[A: This is the first critical point. I felt that Black is leading territory wise, so if I do not let White build a base here I keep my lead. I thought that the thickness White gets in return is not wroth much. Was I wrong?

--> I think this is a fine move; if I were white, I would have invaded the corner at r17, r16, or s16 and left the q10 stone as a reducing move.  Connecting them here in gote does not get him much, and helps b secure the corners (though you don't)]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[pi];B[qj];W[pg]C[bad way of playing for white]
;B[fc]C[A: Here is the second point. Now there is a miai between entering the 3-3 point or enclosing the top.


--> this move works, though s16 also very important.];W[dc]
;B[id]C[A: White selected to enclose the corner, so I tried to take the top.

--> w d16/17 is very very solid, and your f17 stone is very close to it.  There is a proverb that says "don't play near thickness."  I would rather play lightly with your single black stone, which has now acted like a "kikashi" and will prevent white from taking too much territory along the top, especially if you now enclose the top corner -- enclosing the top right will give you a strong base from which to attack white if he pincers your f17 stone, while also affecting his center group.  Alternatively, you could play p3, and if b invades the upper corner, THEN you could naturally make a move like this to take more territory on the top after confining him to a small corner in sente.]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[pk];B[rl];W[jd]C[A: Now comes the interesting part. White is trying to flaten the Black territory at the top and build central moyo.]

(;B[me]C[A: I was trying to counter White plan. This move prevents linkage between the K16 stone and the Q13 group.

This is a bad move.

When contacted, help the stone that is contacted FIRST.  Then you can base your next moves on w's response.  By giving him a lot more power, you lessen his need to make contact, hence making n15 less useful.  Plus the board is too open for you to kill, his strength on the right prevents you from getting anything in the center, and n15 does nothing for you territory wise, so it is a failure.]
;W[je];B[ic];W[jc];B[ie];W[jf];B[mg]C[A: To be consistent with the intention to separate the two White groups.

First, flexibility is also a merit....:-)  

Second, help your weaker group first.  If you push up with j14 or h13, etc., you induce white to jump up to around k12, which then NATURALLY asks you to play a separating move like n13, so that you basically trick white into helping you play a move that separates his groups.  This is a very key strategy point.  Like the original n15, your moves are out of order.]
;W[if]C[A: I would appreciate your input about the next sequence. Did Black take the right direction? Should he just lived at the top?

B should feel miserable that his stones have been so beautifully enclosed by white.  He has played so many stones at the top on the j and n lines and gets virtually nothing for them.  This was an area b was supposedly strong and now he is reduced to gote life.  The ensuing sequence accomplishes that, but already white has wrested much from b.]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[ff];W[gg];B[fg];W[fh];B[df];W[cf];B[de];W[ce]
;B[eh];W[ei];B[fi];W[gh];B[dh];W[fd];B[gd];W[qc]C[A: The result is that Black lives, and White secures the corner at top left. Now White invades the corner, taking away Black territory there. I though it is wrong to let R17 connect to R14, because this will solve the White group problem which up to this point does not hav any eyes. Was it right decision?

--> If you had a concrete plan for attacking white, then your decision would have been ok -- but w's group is long and strong, very tough to kill. By giving up this much territory, again, you are staking the entire game on actually killing one of w's groups.  So play this way only if you have concrete reason to be confident that you can.]
;B[qd];W[rd]
(;B[re];W[rb];B[qe];W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[od];W[nc];B[nd]C[A: I guess N16 is better shape?

yes];W[mb];B[nb];W[ob];B[lb];W[na];B[mi];W[mk];B[lc]C[A: The main reason is to prevent connection between the White corner group and K17.

--timing is questionable.  IF your plan is to kill the white middle group (difficult), you should first lean on the right side group as much as possible, drive it into making life and in the process create more of a black wall in the center of the board -- then -- once you have gone as far in attacking the white q10 group as you can in sente -- THEN you do this.  By doing this too early w gets a chance to make a move that strengthens both his groups, partially nullifying your intent in playing here.]
;W[jk]C[A: This the next turning point.How to regard the White Q13 group - is it weak? On one hand it has no eyes, and it seems to me that I could break between N9 and K9. But I think Black is not string enough at the bottom to support this cut. So may be I should have played at the bottom first. but then I was afraid of White S14, since Black Q16 group does not have 2 eyes either...

neither of w's groups are particularly weak -- but they can definitely be harassed.  I would probably aim at building solid bottom and left side territory by threatening w with cuts, etc.  Playing m17 first unfortunately gives w more strength to rebuff those threats now]
;B[ji]C[A: I decided to go for the cut.];W[fj];B[lk]C[--Did you read out the follow up before playing here?]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[nl];B[mm];W[lj]
(;B[kk]C[Bad, lets white get strong while not getting enough]
;W[kj];B[kl]C[A: May be instead - Black N10, and if White captures - O9?

from here, a possibility, though not as good as the variation I show.]
;W[jl];B[km];W[mj];B[rf]C[A: Now I felt I must secure the top group...
Looking at the overall board, I thought Black is leading at this point. The bottom left is dominated by Black, Black has potential territory on the left and White does not have a lot of territory of his own. Now I see that this is not neccessarily true: Black does not have really any big secure territory, White took 3 of the four corners and overall Black's groups are painfully thin... Am I right?

-->This is a bad move.  The reason this is bad is because k18 and s14 are miai for connecting with your b group, which might even live without connecting.  now a move like p3 is urgent, since the bottom is still wide open, including the corner.]
;W[qq]C[A: White immediately proves that Black does not have a lot of territory...]

;B[mn];W[nn];B[no];W[jo]C[A: Another White hit...]
(;B[kp]C[wrong spirit -- attack first if you can in sente, then defend only if/when w is secure or has very easy escape (like when the board is open).]
;W[iq];B[kh]C[A: At this point, I realized White is leading, so I tried to revive the attack on White group. It does not seem to work...]

;W[di];B[ed];W[ch];B[hl];W[jm];B[ip];W[jp];B[ko];W[kn];B[lm]
C[A: I do not see a way for Black to sustain his attack. So basically I would say that if White does not do a severe mistake, he will win - correct me if I am wrong.
I appreciate any further comments on the rest of the game as well.
Thanks!
