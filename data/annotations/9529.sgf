Dear reviewer,

this is a game I recently played on the internet. Although I felt the game was going quite well for me (White), I eventually ran into the perfect splitting attack and had to resign. I don't think I really played overplays, but probably my defending is to inflexible and does not make use of weaknesses in the opponent's position. Anyway, thanks a lot for your help!



Hello!

My name is Bernd. I am a 2d from Germany, calling myself HonFu in the GTL and other go places. Happy to do your review. :-)

I do not agree with the idea that you ran into a splitting attack eventually - the splitting attack was looming over you all throughout the game, because you did not defend in time and left a weak group behind.

But let's take a closer look!];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qn]

(;W[ql]C[Hon: It is hard to talk about fuseki, because very often it depends so much on taste, and one professional plays what another disapproves of, or history development shows that a move that was deemed bad, becomes the best move. 

Anyway, treating this like a matter of taste - I do not like this pincer very much. (In following variations you will get a lot of hints why I don't like it.]
;B[on];W[np];B[pk]
(;W[qo]C[Hon: I don't like this move here.

It is a joseki, alright, but in this joseki black builds thickness that works well together with the hoshi stone in the upper right. (In later variations I show, why this is annoying for White.) I would like to prevent that kind of development!]
;B[qk];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[rl]
(;W[cf];B[dg]C[AB: Quite unusual?

Hon: I know that this move exists with the komoku, but I haven't seen it with hoshi yet.]

(;W[df];B[ef];W[ee];B[de];W[eg];B[ff];W[dh];B[fg];W[cg]C[AB: I have no idea whether this is anything resembling a joseki...]

(;B[be]C[Hon: This looks strange. First, Black starts to build up towards the center, then suddenly the corner is important. Does Black know what he wants?]
;W[jc]C[Hon: You come in, which is good.];B[lc];W[gc];B[ec]

(;W[jp]LB[je:A]C[AB: Should I defend at 'A'?

Hon: Okay, here you tenukied, thinking that you are strong enough. 

I disagree strongly with this judgement. Yes, you should have jumped!

Now it is time for a little deviation, before we go on. Please see the first variation.]

(;B[hq]
(;W[jq];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cl];B[cq];W[dq];B[ho];W[co];B[bo]
;W[dn];B[cm];W[dm];B[bl];W[bk];B[bm]
(;W[dk]C[AB: I was quite happy until this point, but maybe my position on the left is actually a bit overconcentrated.

Hon: This looks quite slow.

The main problem is, that the upper side group is still there, undefended.]

(;B[hm]
(;W[hk]TR[dk]C[Hon: I think, this is the wrong direction.

You have just played the marked stone to make the left side strong. Now you jump out from a strong group.]
;B[jn];W[mo]C[Hon: This also looks so slow.];B[ik];W[hj];B[lm]
C[Hon: You basically helped your opponent out. What did you get? What is the function of your two-stone walll? Its effect is low, since it's close to your own strength.]

(;W[re]TR[gc][jc]C[AB: I felt I had to enter the right and thought I could live there without too much trouble...

Hon: If only you hadn't to watch the two marked stones at the same time!]
;B[rd]
(;W[qe]LB[qd:A]C[AB: Would 'A' be a better choice?];B[qd]
(;W[qi]C[Hon: This is too risky. You extend right in front of his thickness and are threatened by his invasion immediately.]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[qf];W[rf];B[qh];W[pe]C[AB: Was this any good? I thought a long time here...

Hon: It is a natural move to separate your enemies stones like this.

I think you were thinking here for a long time, because you didn't see a clear way to make eye shape! If you play s12 or cut here, always you will have trouble getting two eyes. Which would maybe manageable (wriggle out and survive somehow), if it wasn't for the group at the top which is also threatened.]
;B[ri];W[rh];B[pi];W[od];B[oc]
(;W[ph]C[Hon: You are getting distracted here by a shape that looks like a squeeze. But the main issue here is your safety!]
;B[nd];W[pg];B[qj]
(;W[pf]LB[oe:A]C[AB: Maybe better connect at 'A'?

Hon: Like this you threaten an eye, so I understand the atari. Problem: You have only two half eyes so far. 

(This time try the surrounding test for yourself!)];B[oe];W[ng]
;B[lg];W[je]C[AB: Finally I defend here, I thought I can work it out.

Hon: After what I showed, you probably already feel different about it now.]

(;B[jg];W[ni];B[oi];W[mg];B[oh];W[nf];B[lf];W[li]
(;B[nh];W[mh];B[me];W[ji]C[AB: One group seems safe now...]
;B[ii];W[ij];B[jj];W[kj];B[jk];W[ih];B[ig]
(;W[hi]LB[he:A]C[AB: Maybe this was a mistake? Would defending at 'A' be better?

Hon: I am not sure if the group lives after A (see variation).

Okay, let us end the review here.

I wanted to show you one thing - that your group at the top was weak all the time, while you thought it was safe and flexible and you could afford to play somewhere else. I also gave you an easy method how to think about if you are safe or not.

I hope you incorporate the surrounding test into your strategical planning. Because if you do, you will definitely defend that kind of group early and not create a second weak group, losing control of the game.

At this moment I want to argue one more point. Often in a review you hear the stronger player say, you should not make terrified defense moves (often in the next sentence they say something like, "look how strong this group is" ...). They maybe also say that if you always defend your groups randomly, you will not learn anything since you don't fight hard enough.

If you are in a game, you should definitely not defend randomly; but you should also not tenuki randomly! You should try your very best to make a correct assessment. Is the group alive as it stands, or is there still bad potential? And if you are not sure, if you think, there might be some danger, if you have a bad feeling, but you can't read it out, although you try and try ... what do you do then?

Defend! 

Because if you don't, the K.O. might very well come around a few moves later. Better lose sente once than to risk immediate loss of the whole game.

The core of the problem in such a case is that you aren't able to read it out properly and therefore can't make a proper judgement. Therefore you have to just avoid the risk of death by defending, although maybe it is not necessary. This is indeed the main reason why we study go problems - in order to get a clear, correct judgement if we (or the opponent) can tenuki or not!

Okay, that's all for now, I hope it was helpful!];B[ib]C[AB: Now I'm in trouble...]

(Please try to count this for yourself!)]))
(;W[in]C[Hon: Locally I think you should play something like this and kill Black's group.

Or, if he somehow finds a way to survive this mess, you have good influence to reduce whatever he may want to build in the upper right.]
)
(;W[je]C[Hon: Probably still here. Even if Black moves at the bottom, he will still be weak.

Cutting at the left edge does not bring a lot of profit, since - as you said yourself - the area was overconcentrated to begin with.]
))
(;AB[ge][ie][ke]TR[ha][ia][hb][ib][ge][ie][ke]C[Hon: Okay, let us make our surrounding test.

It is very simple, even a beginner can do this much. (Problem is, we have no habit to actually do it; that's how we get into trouble.)

So, is White alive?

Obviously NOT, right? You probably ask yourself now, how you could not see this. Just four points of eyespace will not be enough to survive confinement.

Which means, that the group, surrounded by the enemy, is quite weak! 

Which of course means, that you can not allow Black to get another move here, but should definitely strengthen the group by jumping out!]

[dd][pd][be][de][ee][cf][df][ef][ff][cg][eg][fg][dh][pk][qk]
[ql][rl][qm][rm][on][rn][dp][jp][np]C[Hon: Very often, players make a certain shape and just assume that it is alive. For example, they capture a stone, make a ponnuki, and then they feel like superman, invincible. 

I do not like this perception at all - but I find it supported even by medium amateur dans. Even in professional books, the author sometimes says a sentence like, "Look at this group, how strong it is; how can it ever die?"

The professional player has a huge amount of experience and is highly trained in fighting and life and death. He has that kind of feeling. But for most of us amateurs, just assuming that a group is alive, can be really dangerous.

Because we do not really see it!

So we are just guessing it!

And anything, that makes you GUESS in a THINKING game, will turn out harmful in the long run. At least, if you're guessing, you should know you are doing it, and not mistake it for an analysis. 

Here is an example of what I mean ...];W[on]C[Hon: In a beginner problem, you might be urged to find something like this net.

"Look how STRONG the group now is! It has one safe eye already, and it can easily make another one!"

Okay, but just how easily?

We can think about this using the "Surrounding test".];AB[mk]
[ok][lm][lo][lq]C[Hon: Let us assume that a fight takes place in another part of the board and black gets to play stones around your group. He ends in sente, because you have to defend that huge white dragon which he hunted in the center. Anyway, now it is Black's move. 

Where is White's second eye? Do you still see it with all the black stones around?]
;B[pm];W[pn];B[no];W[oo];B[rm]C[Hon: Right, I also don't see it.

So the assumption that the group was totally alive, was not entirely correct, right?]
;AB[po]AE[mk][ok][lm][pm][rm][pn][lo][no][oo][lq]TR[on]C[Hon: Of course after we have played the net, we feel good, because our stones are connected, have one eye and can easily make another eye. And this is not wrong, it's the right feeling.

But we still have to judge this group as not 100% alive - in certain situations it might die! And while making decisions in other parts of the board, we have to always keep things like this in mind!

So when you make a move like this and become "so strong", make the surrounding test in your mind and ask yourself - if for some reason this group is completely confined, will it still be able to live? If you can't see that it clearly lives, then be on your guard! Either defend now or at least play conservatively in the surrounding areas in order to not compromise the safety of your group!

(Now back to the game.)])
(;B[hd]C[Hon: I think, Black should play this standard sequence.]
;W[hc];B[jd];W[id];B[ie];W[ic];B[kd];W[he];B[if];W[ge]C[Hon: Now White is alive, alright. But do you like this result for White?]
;B[jj]C[Hon: If Black plays somewhere around here, how are you going to reduce this monster of a moyo?]
))
(;W[je]TR[ee]C[Hon: I would definitely recommend to play here now! 

You strengthen your group, run towards the center; and if you are stronger, Black has to worry again about how he defends the right side. 

Also, at some point in the future the marked stone might run away and help isolate Black in the center.

By jumping out here, you not only defend, you aim at something. It is really important!]
))
(;B[jd]TR[ee]C[Hon: As Black, I would probably play something like this now (if something had driven me to play the sequence in the upper left).

Black gets a nice moyo in the whole upper right sector. The marked stone doesn't look so dangerous to me.]
))
(;W[cc]C[Hon: I would probably just invade.]
(;B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[fc]C[Hon: After the natural sequence, Black still has bad aji. Also you get a solid group towards the upper edge, making it a bit harder for Black to increase his influence zone towards the right.]
)
(;B[dc]TR[jd]C[Hon: You probably know that Black wouldn't like too much to block here. This joseki is usual when Black already has a stone around the marked spot.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[jc]C[Hon: You end up playing right in the middle of his influence, reducing enough of the wall's effect. (Maybe I would play one spot further to the right.)]
)))
(;W[nc]C[Hon: I think, many people would play something like this now, to prevent further growth of Black's influence.]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me]C[Hon: Of course, Black will build up his influence anyway and his two walls seem to work together well.]
)
(;W[jc]C[Hon: I like moves like this - just splitting Black calmly. Whatever Black plays next, you get a base and can still at reduction of what he built.]
;B[lc];W[fc];B[hc];W[fe];B[cf];W[id];B[db];W[hd]C[Hon: For example with this joseki (there are other variations) White gets a solidish group and Black still has to defend his place at the right side. Of course, also here Black will grow.]
)
(;W[qf]C[Hon: This would be helping Black to put his thickness to good use.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd]C[Hon: White has a weak group in front of Black's thickness.

To summarize - due to the pincer, after Black had jumped out, you were forced to either play the variation I dislike (if you can handle it, you can play it); or you give up the side, as you did, but then, since Black already had a hoshi stone in the upper right, the thickness works very well together with it.]
))
(;W[qk];B[pj];W[pl];B[ol];W[qj];B[pi];W[qh]C[Hon: I would go for this (if I had played the pincer). 

Black still has a solidity issue to solve.];B[og];W[qf];B[oe]
C[Hon: If something like this happened (looks too shapy and bookish to me, but just for illustration) ...]
;W[jc]LB[om:A]C[Hon: ... you would again split the upper side.

Anyway, I do not like this joseki. This may again be a taste thing, but I try to prevent that sequence whenever I can. Because in my feeling it is "bad for both". White is confined and rather small, and Black has influence that is not easy to use (because it is not part of a moyo structure, if Black already had a stone on the upper side, where White now sits, things would be different), and he still has to think about the Weakness at A.

I heard other people say they like this joseki. It is maybe something for more flexible players. I prefer clean shapes myself (even if I don't always find them ^_°).]
))
(;W[nq]C[Hon: I normally always play here. 

Black can build up, alright, but whatever he does on the right side, he will be not as thick as in the variation you played. So if you hand over the right side anyway, you might just play here from the start and don't help Black grow as easily as in the game.]
))
