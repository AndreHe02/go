C[review done by Kichiro (KGS 5k)

black (IGS 13k) White (KGS 7k)];B[pd]C[Hi, first of all, thank you for taking the time to review this game for us. I hope you can review both sides, as we both want feedback. Thanks.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[jd]C[Marvin: It's a little bit strange to ignore an approach like that and perhaps a play at the k16 point is not as valuable as it may seem. It's better to settle the lower right first.]
;W[qc]C[Marvin: this play is far too early. It's something should be played at a much later stage of the game. When black ignores the approach at O3 it's more valuable to exploit this and play in the lower right.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
C[Marvin: As you see here. White hasn't gained that much. A play somewhere on the left, bottom right, or bottom would have given him much more. He's also helped black get some strong shape with which he connects to the K16 stone now. Making K16 much stronger than it should be.]
;B[qf];W[qn]C[Marvin: white's approach is a little bit much though. especially with the stone at Q10. i can see the intent but I think something simpler would have been better for now. Also.. the left and the bottom are still bigger. So trying to diminish black's space is a little bit... early.]
;B[pn]C[How should black deal with this invasion?

Marvin: Actually black should have dealt with this by not ignoring the approach. But let's see what possibilities there are]

(;W[mh]C[Marvin: this jump is not that good as you can see how easy it is for black to build a better shape and white isn't that much further ahead.

It should be clear however that if white lives inside of black's shape that black loses a tremendous amount of points. Points not easily recovered.]
;B[li];W[mi];B[qj];W[lg];B[ik]C[At this point I thought I (black) was ahead so I didn't pursure white's group... should I have continued attacking it?

Marvin: White's group is really weak at this point. So I think it's ok to leave it a little bit. Al though he might escape... 

J9 is a mistake though. I think if you want to not ignore white and gain territory your should play at F17. This way you white will have more trouble going somewhere and you gain a lot. 

And the left is completely open.];W[jg];B[jo]C[Marvin: ignoring K13 is a mistake though.]

(;B[cn]C[Marvin: Although ignoring it again may seem like a mistake. White will connect after all. But white connecting is less valuable than C6. Actually everytime white needs to connect and doesn't gain anything black can work on his lead.

I think... playing at C3 might be more interesting.];W[dn];B[dm]

Marvin: probably somehow.. but is it worth it? I would cut my loss and try to gain a little bit from it. I think going into saving this is too complicated and being in this situation is a problem it should be how can I avoid getting here not how should I get out of it.]
