C[HarolBrown (4k) vs. Vision (4k)

This is one of those games where you try to apply all you've learned - counter enemy intentions, press weak stones against your thickness and so on, but in the end it turns out in a way you just didn't foresee at all.

I'd be really happy if you could see through this game and tell me everything you see better, and I'd be grateful for some advice about how I can improve - I'm almost 3k and need a little push.

Thank you!];B[qc];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[nd]C[I don't like playing against this black opening. If you kakari, he gets big territory, if you invade the middle, he comes from the sides and builds moyo while attacking, and you are left with your all too open niren or sanren.]
;B[pe];W[jc];B[hc];W[jp];B[qn];W[ql]C[Was this pincer wrong? I didnt want to have him a huge right side, which would be safer than my open sanren. But in the end he got the huge wall that will tease me later.]

(;B[qh]C[this move is slow, because S12 is lower black shouldn't have to worry about his shape as much as with the normal joseki]
;W[rg];B[qg]C[this move doesn't remove any huge potental threats either, should still invade]

C[black gained a bit more of a solid group while removing all of your weakness.]

(;W[ch];B[cl]C[I wished I could kill any of such invasions. You know that they are wrong, but you just fail to stop them. Here I manage to kill him, but he will still be able to profit from it. How could I have punished this harder?]

(;W[el];B[im];W[jn];B[hl]C[And there he got me. I was attacking his group and managed to kill it - and then he swarms around me, using a ko fight to extract his top stones and then threatens to build a center territory with his right side wall. How could I have handled this better?

And please do not only show me the correct variation, but tell me what kind of thoughts should guide me when I attack a weak group. How can I know, where weaknesses will appear? Are there any proverbs or rules of thumb except "don't touch them"?]
