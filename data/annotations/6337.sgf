C[Hi,

Thanks very much for reviewing the game.  I have left a few comments throughout.  My biggest question is outlined on move 88.  Any comments you have on any move are of course welcome.

C[D: Here he makes a mistake.  I marked out the joseki for him after the game.]

(;W[mb]C[N: Actually, there is a joseki variation that starts like this, which, depending on a ladder, can be better than the usual one (see variation)]

(;B[gp]TR[ol][om][on][pn][oo]C[D: Here I wanted to approach the corner in a way that threatened K3.  Do you agree with this play?

N: First of all, you would have been in a stronger position to attack this stone if you had captured the marked stones at move 63. 

I think before approaching the corner, you sould harass the center group a little more and build up strength.]
;W[jo];B[jn]C[N: I do not agree with this move here. Attachments are for defense, when you are weak, not for attacking. The way your opponent answered it turned out ok for you, but you can't always rely on your opponent to do that :)]

(;W[kn];B[ko];W[in];B[jp];W[jm];B[ip];W[ln];B[mo]C[N: You make some territorry at the bottom, however the center white group is very strong now.]
;W[fq];B[dm];W[cn]
(;B[fm]C[N: big mistake, see variation];W[cm]
(;B[ef];W[gc]C[D: This is where I think I need the most help.  I want to use that wall to the right, but if I push him that way he gets a base.  So I push him the other way.

My problem I think is that I'm not good at using my walls to attack yet. I didn't play in that area earlier because of the proverb not to use a wall to make territory.  However, maybe I should have extended from the shimari before 87 to prevent that invasion.  Or maybe the joseki I chose top-right wasn't a good idea (although he made the joseki mistake, so I couldn't predict it).

Your thoughts on this would be much appreciated.  I feel that most of my mistakes I understand after looking at the game, but I'm unsure how to deal with this situation even after looking.

N: I think White was unreasonable in playing there, and you were right in the direction you chose. But again, your attack is not very powerful and white manages to get out.]

(;B[ic]C[N: I think this is the right direction here, but maybe a move one to the right might make your wall more stable]
;W[ge]
(;B[jg]C[N: This move I don't understand. I thought you wanted to attack W and use the wall on the right, not let him run out into the center where he is strong.]
;W[gg];B[eh];W[gi]C[N: Now white is out in the center and achieved his objective of reducing your moyo without giving up any points of his own.]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[fj];W[gj];B[fk];W[gk];B[el]C[This move seemed weak when I made it, but not making it seemed to big a loss.  That probably means 97 was a bad move.]
;W[gl];B[cl]C[N: I don't think this move works very well, see variation]

(;W[dn]C[N: this move I can't understand, only forces B to solidify his position without gaining anything.]

However, in this game your opponent missed some good moves and the game got close and was decided in the endgame, where you might have won if you didn't give away sente at 177...
