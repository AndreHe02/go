C[stinksauer [3k\]: hi
Giroro [2k\]: hi, have fun

G: Hello I'm Giroro on KGS, this game was close. I will write some comments starting with this "G:" which you can answer, but please feel free to comment on whatever you find interesting for me.
I played as white, but please review for both sides.
Thanks for the review.

d: the focus of this game is a few big cuts of large weak groups. White played very well and had many chances for a large win, but made a few tactical missteps.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[dd];W[pd]C[d: I would prefer a different move here.  The 4-4 point is for making moyos in a center-oriented game, but this diagonal fuseki should lead to a territory oriented game.]
;B[jq];W[fc];B[df];W[jd];B[cj];W[qn];B[ql]
(;W[on]TR[jq]C[d: usually white goes into the corner.  Since the marked stone is low, you shouldn't be afraid of giving black a wall here.

When you jump out like this you will get thickness in the center, but in this game that thickness won't be worth much.]

;B[qf]
(;W[pg]MA[pf][of][oe][pe]C[G: Is this aji-keshi? The purpose of the move was to avoid being cut around Xs. I did not mind making this vulgar move beacause I felt the right side was already black territory, but it feels weird.

d: I wouldn't call it aji-keshi, but the shape is odd, and it looks like you are playing close to your stronger stones rather than helping the corner.  I would play the variation, to strengthen the corner.  Your move does have the advantage of being sente though.]

(;B[qg]C[d: black has to answer];W[fe];B[rd]C[d: this seems to help white make a big upper side territory. I'd wait.]
;W[qc];B[fg];W[gg];B[gh]
(;W[gf]C[d: I would go the other way, to surround a huge upper side.  But it looks ilke that might give black an equally large left side.]
;B[hh];W[fh];B[ff];W[eh]LB[fi:a]C[G: should be at A?

d: no, I like this move better since it strengthen's your group in sente.]
;B[dg]
(;W[ig]TR[ge]C[d: good way to defend the marked cut.]
(;B[gj];W[cm];B[lh];W[ih]C[d: good separate black to use your wall to the right.]
;B[lf];W[ld];B[lj];W[ij];B[ll];W[ej];B[gl];W[il];B[ln];W[el]
;B[fq]C[d: this abandons the center group.  white should get a strong attack.]

(;W[hn]C[d: you could try a leaning attack now.];B[gn]
(;W[fp]C[G: next few moves give a bad result for white. Not sure how to handle this.

d: I think you needed to make the leaning attack earlier.];B[gp]
;W[fo]C[G: totally vulgar];B[go];W[eq];B[fr]C[d: white let black get away too easily here.]
;W[mo]C[d: good.  break into the side and threaten the center group. Breaking up the lower side territory puts white way ahead.]

;B[pm]
(;W[mk]TR[lm]C[G: aji-keshi?

d: It depends on whether you can cut at the marked point.  Since he didn't defend against your peep, you want to find a way to connect your key n6 stones in sente, then cut.   If this move is part of the sente connection, and it still allows the cut, then it's good.  If you can connect and then cut without it, it's bad.

I looks to me like you can connect in sente and then cut, so this move is aji-keshi.

You missed a big chance here to cut and win the game.];B[lk]
;W[lm]C[G: aji-keshi again?

d: just a different move order.];B[km];W[no];B[pn];W[po]C[G : and again?

d: yes, probably.  this is more like a sente endgame, so it's too early.  At least it is wasting a ko threat.  Without this move, there might be a bigger move later at O2.]
;B[qo];W[oo];B[qp]
(;W[db]C[d: is the cut at L8 now impossible?  If so, your move at N9 was very bad.  If not, you should cut now.]
;B[cc];W[hm];B[gm]
(;W[hq]C[d: I would still be looking at the cut at L8.  You might be able to trick him...]
;B[gq]
(;W[jm]C[d: now there is no chance to cut at l8 later.  Is this move necessary? I would want to try to ssave the h3 stone and either separate the two big black groups or leave them short of eyes.]
;B[kl];W[jn];B[kn]
(;W[jr]C[d: doesn't j3 work?];B[kq];W[kr];B[iq];W[ir];B[hr]
;W[rc]C[d: big, but e2 is much bigger.];B[qd]C[G: this hurts]
;W[pe];B[cq];W[io]C[G: I seem to love aji-keshi];B[ip];W[cp]
;B[dr];W[er];B[es];W[ci];B[di];W[dh];B[ch];W[bi];B[bh]
(;W[dj]LB[bj:a]C[G: anything better, avoiding the squeeze is possible?

d: it looks like you can just play B10.];B[ai];W[bj];B[bk];W[ck]
;B[aj]
(;W[cj]TR[ei]C[d: capturing is better.  This would make a huge difference later.]
;B[cb];W[bl]C[d: black played well in the lower left so the game is now very close again.]

;B[or];W[mr];B[pr];W[sd];B[mn];W[mg]TR[nn];B[lg];W[me];B[ke]

(;W[kd]LB[je:a]C[G: should it be at A, given the continuation?

d: k15 is certainly safer.  You should be worried about the cut at j14, since black is thick now.]
;B[hg];W[hf];B[if];W[ie];B[jf];W[gi];B[hi];W[hj];B[fi];W[ii]
;B[gi];W[gk]TR[ei]C[d: a stone at e11 would be really useful in this fight...]
;B[hk];W[fk];B[ik];W[jk];B[hl];W[ki];B[jl];W[li];B[mi]LB[kj:c]

(;W[mj]LB[ji:b][mh:a]C[G: no hurry I guess. This move and A are miai, so I can play B now.

d: yes.  you are a little greedy.  You need careful reading here. But you can still make this move if you play correctly later.]
;B[ji]
(;W[jh]C[d: doesn't the atari from the other side (K10) work?]
;B[kh]
(;W[jj];B[kj];W[fj];B[ji]C[d: black did very well here, and has caught up a lot.  I still think white is ahead.]

(;W[ki]C[G: worthless move. I'm upset I occured a loss in this fight.

d: yes.  black is tvery thick here now, so you need to defend your stones to the right.]
;B[ml];W[nl]C[G: same here, stupid move.];B[nn];W[ls];B[ok]
