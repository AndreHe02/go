AB[pd][dp];W[pq];B[po];W[cd]C[Not sure if this is really possible with Q3.  You will end up with some fighting or possible loses around Q3.  I'm not sure the other corner is worth it, but its a style thing.]
;B[oq]
(;W[op]C[this move generally considered bad form.  White esentially makes a cross cut and a cross cut for the aggresor (ie white here) often requires a sacriffice.  That might be fine later in the game but in the opening it can have drastic affects for the whole game.  In short be ready and willing to have a fight.

P2 reinforces what your trying to undo with P4, the moyo along the bottum.  O3 would be a natural response and that would make that moyo stronger.  

See varitions for some other ideas.

Is this a bad move?
Maybe a hane at P2 would be better?];B[pp];W[nq];B[or];W[nr]

(;W[ec]C[The corner is not complete yet.  See variation.

As for too slow I feel you should be making corner approaches.  Black could simply take Q3 and still be well ahead.  

And extending further doesn't change the fact your playing right near your stone.  Whites big problem is not having the stones around at the beginning like black.  White needs to distribute more around to ensure black's moyo don't get too big to deal with.

Too slow?
Should I have extended more?];B[ic]C[Black is being pushy, thinking he can diminish whites shimari.  White wouldn't have played this direction anyways so black is just putting a stone near white to be pushed around.  Black will have to fix later or risk something like M17.]

(;W[de]C[Think about where your pushing that stone and where your stone could get pushed when you play contact plays.  D14 would give black nothing to press against with his next move and he would have to fix the threat around G16 to keep that stone viable.

What happens here is by pressing on D15 black can make the stones' group immune to the cut at G16.  This also allows black to put even more influence on the top side.  Black gets this for free.

Is this move ok? Or should I play more lightly?];B[df];W[cf]
;B[dd];W[ce];B[ed]
(;W[dg]C[Don't encourage black's influnece on the side.  E14 works very well with the other black wall on the other side of the board.]
;B[ef];W[dc];B[fc]
(;W[fq]C[For black this area here has far less invested in it.  So while the opportunity to disrupt it is there F16 is bigger and works against the 14 stones forming the moyo on the upper side.  While D4 works against the 3 stones on the lower side.  Take the biggest opportunity to disrupt on the board just as you would take the biggest opportunity to make territory.]

(;W[as]C[F16 disappears and your best chance to undo the moyo on the top side goes also.  He gets much of that corner also.  Huge amount to give away as this helped build the territory that won him the game by 7pts.  if you can fight the ko then do so, don't just give it up.  What about R3 as a threat?

See variation for another possible way forward.

Should I have responded to the stone at C17? Or was it fine to ignore it for the moment and finish the ko?]
