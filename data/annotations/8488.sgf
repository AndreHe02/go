;B[op]C[ch: this strengenthd w enormously. Now, M3 is very weak...]

(;B[gp]C[ch: it is already difficult situation for b. M3 and M6 are too close to the w wall. B has to reduce the w incluence. 
I would suggest to start the reduction with H4];W[io]C[ch: In my opinion w J5 is already overconcentrated before its wall.
Thus, I would look out for sabaki with G4 and abandon M3, M6.]
(;B[jn]C[ch: In my opinion this is wrong direction. You are fighting too close to w strength.]

ch: G4 is in trouble. But you could switch into the corner]
(;B[dq];W[cq]C[now what?
ch: hm, difficult. You could start crosscutting on c4 like in the variation]
