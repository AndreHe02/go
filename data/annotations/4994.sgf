Emp: yes, B is better.]
(;W[bd];B[bb];W[ea];B[da]C[Emp: in General, B is stronger, as the rank suggests. both players are not so war-mongering in this game. So, i can't tell their fighting strenghth. b is better in moyo building, thickness. b should fight more often to get stronger to avoid moves like B2. w needs to improve understanding of moyo and thickness etc.
