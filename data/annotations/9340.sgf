C[Hi!
Thanks in advance for reviewing my game. I hope you'll enjoy it ! :)

I (10k KGS) am playing white without komi, as black is 11k.

I eventually won by 28.5 points but this is not representative of the game because I tricked my opponent at the very end of yose (mv. 210). Before that the game was close even though my opponent was playing rather passively, and I feel like I must have made some strategic mistakes early on.

I have specific questions at moves 15, 21, 45 and 63, but of course feel free to comment everything !

Drgoplayer:  I put in a lot of comments.  Overall you need to look for more severe attacks as in reply to C6, try out invasion points as on left side, try to read carefully to see if a group is already alive before defending it in gote]

(;W[fp]C[Drgoplayer: This makes the invasion easy for b.  I have put in a couple lines to consider]
;B[ck]C[Timm: I think my moves at D10 and F4 were okay, but here I'm not sure about what I should aim for strategically. Could you please say a word on this ?]
;W[cj];B[dk]
(;W[ej]C[Drgoplayer: Hane at the head of 2 stones (almost without thought). see variation]
;B[do];W[cp];B[qg]TR[ob][pc][qc][qf][qh][qj][ql][qq]C[Timm: Here I have two questions.

First, given my position is there really nothing I can do to attack black's group on the left ?! And if no, how should I have dealt with it ?

Second, what result can I expect from an invasion (e.g., at "a" or "b") ? Also, is it better to settle and give black influence or to run through his moyo, with the risk of giving him a lot of territory in the process ?
Drgoplayer:  there are many invasion points.  If you amnage to keep sente (unlikely) you might get 3 of them.  So try to get 2 of the invasions]

(;B[qe]SQ[nc]C[Drgoplayer: with the marked stone generally b should not play at r15]

(;W[pe]TR[qg]C[Timm: I guess this is probably a mistake.];B[oe]

(;W[qb];B[pb];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg]C[Drgoplayer: alive as is I think so take sente]

(;W[sd]C[Timm: I don't really know where this stone should be. If there's a way to kill, I can't find it.]

(;W[se];B[nd]LB[fe:B][li:C][eo:A][qo:D]SQ[ql][qn][qq][pr]C[Timm: I've got sente, so where should I play ?

I played "A" in a (futile?) attempt to attack black's group.

"B" seems obvious. Is is urgent to reduce at e.g. C, or to invade around D ? Black's played two space extensions so there's some aji but I can't find the proper way to use it. I feel like he's made a huge corner with just three stones and I can't do anything ! That's very annoying xD
Drgoplayer:  B C are OK.  Also marked some invasion points]

(;W[eo];B[en]C[Drgoplayer: see variation F6 first. There is still some aji here.  If b is not careful can be forced to run into center and w will build territory]

[qq]C[Timm: Again, I've got sente, and I am not sure about what to do. I think both players have about the same amount of territory but black's got more potential (maybe not ?).

I played at A with the intention of running into the middle and in prevision of playing B-C (which actually didn't work, but as you'll see my opponent played as if it did...).

But maybe it'd have been sufficient to expand my own territory at D or E ?

Drgoplayer: invade!  A or D do not create much territory as they are miai.  D is better since it is great move for black.  E makes territroy but doesnt reduce b influence,  Influence gives black lead here.Around triangle to reduce blacks influence]
;W[gi];B[ff]C[Timm: Black takes this important point...];W[bl]
;B[bk];W[bn]C[Timm: This actually didn't work at all, but my opponent was kind enough to just pull back.]

(;B[cl];W[bm];B[cm];W[dm]C[Drgoplayer: really pointless];B[gj]

(;W[hi]C[Timm: To be consistent I should have played the hane but I felt like I just couldn't and I let black live fully...

Drgoplayer:  Dont think the hane will work for you with good play by black]
;B[hj]LB[ig:B][lj:A][mr:C]SQ[ic][lc][nd][oe][ff][qg][qk][pn]
C[Drgoplayer:  huge influence
A or B looks to make territory while C reduces white just a little]

(;W[nr]LB[ql:C][qn:B][qq:A]C[Timm: This was an attempt to activate the aji of the two space jumps, but I eventually didn't find how to use it.
Drgoplayer: just invade];B[fj];W[fi];B[mn]LB[hf:A][ql:D][qn:C]
[qq:B]C[Timm: So black got to play in second important move I mentionned earlier (F14 and N6). I'm starting to think this may have been the reason why I was behind...
