C[Zander [3k\]: hi
SaurusDNA [4k\]: Hi

Dear reviewer.
I played black here and fell behind early in the game, and couldn't catch up. Please review for the black side.

I noticed that I kept on getting gote in this game. What is the reason for this? Am I making bad shape? Am I trying to live where I should be running?

Where could I have improved in strategy or tactics?

This is one of those games that no matter how many times I review it myself, I cannot see where I went wrong.

I have tried as far as possible to put my thoughts down during the game, so as to help you understand my thinking, and where I have the wrong idea altogether.

Please could you help with any concepts, thoughts or suggestions as to how you feel I could improve my game.

Many thanks
Mark (SaurusDNA)

Julian: Hi!  All my comments will look like this.  I think it should all be pretty self-explanatory, I put some general remarks with the last node!  As per your request, I've tried to focus on sente as much as reasonable.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[po];B[pl];W[no]
(;B[nq];W[lo];B[lq];W[pi]
(;B[pg]TR[qe][qf][re][rf][se][sf]C[SaurusDNA: Wasn't sure of the best continuation here. This felt natural, but ended up giving me problems.

Julian: This move doesn't do a lot for you territory-wise (just the triangled points), and strengthens W's weak stone.  Much better in this case to run with the Q8 immediately.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]C[Julian: This was a mistake by W - you don't have to answer.]
(;B[or]SQ[nq]C[SaurusDNA: I considered s2, but I wanted to settle the group completely, since I will be fighting with q8.

Julian: The group is already settled without this stone!  B plays the marked stone to make R4 gote - otherwise the joseki at N3 is much better along the bottom (see the variation after move 6).]
;W[ni];B[qn]LB[nl:A]C[SaurusDNA: Somehow, I feel that trying to live here was a mistake. However, I thought that running was also bad, since w-m11gives white tons of influence along the top, while I have to keep running.

How best to handle this position? What should my goals and strategy be?

Julian: Trying to live here was definitely the wrong idea!  This early in the game living under there just gives W powerful influence for what was only potential territory.  Instead, you should tenuki.  

Later, when the outside is more developped, and the W's wall wouldn't be looking out on an empty board, living inside becomes a very appealing idea.]
;W[nl];B[qj]C[SaurusDNA:  Now I have no choice but to live.]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[rh];B[rj];W[qg];B[rl]C[SaurusDNA: Gote! It was painful to have to play here.]
;W[pf]SQ[pg]C[Julian: And now the marked stone is almost completely neutralized.]
;B[oc];W[dq];B[do]C[SaurusDNA: Was c5 better?

Julian: I personally like C5 better here, but mostly because the pincer against D5 is very strong.  As it played out this went well for you.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[gq]LB[eq:A]C[Julian: This is an overplay.  The extension up the left is still best, but you should be planning to play at A early on to help settle your shape.]
;B[dj]LB[ch:A]C[SaurusDNA: Was c10 better in this position?

Julian: C10 is definitely better.  D10 makes an extension to A a great move for W.]
;W[jq]C[SaurusDNA: I wanted to settle this group, but...

Julian: W has no plausible attack against either group here.  W should have played on the left side.  K3 is a slow move, and you should punish it!]
(;B[qo];W[pp];B[rp];W[rq];B[so]C[SaurusDNA: Gote again...    :(

Julian: Worse than that - W can now diminish the bottom group to just a few points in sente]
;W[cg]C[Julian: Now C10 would be better.]
(;B[jc]LB[eq:A]C[SaurusDNA: Here, I feel that this was too small, but white is thick everywhere, so I don't see where else to play.

Julian: A play along the top here was absolutely called for.

You might have considered playing at A first.];W[fc]
(;B[hc]LB[lc:A][mc:B]C[SaurusDNA: Was this move OK? It's fairly big, and gives me some strength - I felt this was important because white is strong all around me.

Julian: This stone is too close to K17 to really be useful.  Later, if W plays at A or B H17 will be overconcentrated, and making these stones live will be hard.

If A and B weren't possible for W, this would be a strong play.]
;W[nf]
(;B[ci]LB[eq:A]C[ASaurusDNA: I'm behind on territory and thought it was important to catch up.

What other options do I have here? White has no weaknesses, I'm behind on territory and the center is pretty much shared.

Julian: This is a tough position.  A play along the top is big, but gote, so you can't afford it now.  If you're going to win, you'll need to invade the upper right - and there's no time like the present!  You might consider a forcing move at A here first though.]
;W[bh];B[dg]C[SaurusDNA: B11 felt way too passive.

Julian: B11 is definitely out, but this doesn't help you much either.  This allows W to secure the corner if he chooses.  The corner invasion or a play towards the center are both big now.]
;W[df];B[cf]C[Julian: Often aggresive plays turn out to be gote since you have to come back and defend, while defensive plays turn out to be sente since your thickness allows you to ignore your opponents' moves a few moves down the road.

This cut is pretty much sure to be gote.];W[ce];B[bf];W[dh]
;B[eg];W[ch];B[ef];W[de];B[bi]LB[fi:A]C[SaurusDNA: At least I get this in sente.

Julian: You're probably better off getting the play at A.  A few points along the bottom aren't worth letting W cut your stones so easily.]
;W[ei];B[ej];W[gi];B[fj]C[SaurusDNA: Cannot let white f10.]
;W[fi]
(;B[gg]TR[ef][dg][eg]LB[hf:A][hg:B][eq:C]C[Julian: This move is small and over concentrated.

If you want to help your three stones, consider A or B instead.

A forcing move at C is also large.  If W wants to spend 2 moves killing the three marked stones, you should be happy to let him.  Often a sacrifice can be a great way to get sente.]
;W[fm];B[cl]LB[bn:A]C[SaurusDNA: Again, painful to have to play this. Did I have other options?

Julian: Your stones here are strong enough that you didn't need to reinforce at all.  If you do reinforce, at least A threatens a monkey jump later if W ignores.]
;W[mc];B[ec]C[SaurusDNA: I tried to make complications, since I was behind, and this is probably the only area where a fight is possible. The white d15 group has bad shape, so I wanted to cut it off from the rest.

Julian: Your stones on the outside are a little too weak to support this sort of fighting just yet.  If you can settle the outside stones first, then this attack becomes very effective.  Also, with three weak groups, the most likely result is that you lose one of them, *and* end in gote defending the other two.]

(;W[ic];B[dc];W[be];B[bd];W[af];B[cd];W[bg];B[cb]C[SaurusDNA: But ended in gote again...   :(]
;W[jd];B[ig];W[le]
(;B[ah]C[SaurusDNA: I thought taking white's second eye here would help me escape with the g13 group. However, white ignored it. Was this a good or bad move?

Julian: A terrible move!  ;)

W has so many places to run to, that killing him just isn't an option.  Much better to press from the outside, and if *he* plays A12, you can count that as a victory.

The stone at A12 is worth maybe 3 points unless you can make the kill threat plausible.  A stone on the outside is worth a lot more, and if W is careless, you can play at A12 once his escape route is cut off.]
;W[kr];B[hk]C[SaurusDNA: In retrospect, trying to kill while having a weak group was a mistake. I think perhaps j11 was better?

Julian: Definitely.];W[ii];B[ji]C[SaurusDNA: I have to live, even if it means white lives also. That's why I played a contact move here.]
;W[jj];B[ih];W[hj];B[hh];W[gk]C[SaurusDNA: Ouch!];B[hf]C[SaurusDNA: Gote AGAIN...]
;W[ki];B[hi];W[gj];B[ij];W[ik]
(;B[hl]C[Julian: At this point, W doesn't even have to win the ko to catch the two B stones.  You're better off keeping this move in reserve in case it becomes useful later.]
;W[ii];B[eh];W[di];B[ij];W[jk];B[ie];W[jb];B[kp]C[SaurusDNA: I thought that by threatening to connect, I might get into the L7 area.]
;W[jo];B[gm];W[fl];B[ko];W[jn];B[jp];W[ip];B[gn]C[Julian: This is just strengthening W!  When you have stones surrounded so completely lik this, try to read out their path to safety entirely.  If you can't, then sacrifice them so that you at least get points from them (instead of losing points).]
;W[fn];B[kn];W[jm];B[nm]C[SaurusDNA: I feel that I could do something here. Was there a better move?

(;B[qc]LB[qb:A]C[SaurusDNA: I lived, but with only three points. Was there a better way to handle this corner?

Julian: A might have been better, but since you caught the two W stones on the right, and took away his territory there, this worked out fine for you.]

Julian: I would actually say you've been in yose for at least 30 moves now ;).  Several plays at the bottom are big, and sente for you.  Broadly though, things seem pretty well resolved now.]

;W[am];B[bj];W[ai];B[aj];W[gl]C[Zander [3k\]: thanks
SaurusDNA [4k\]: Thanks!

Julian: In this game you seemed to focus very heavily on destroying your opponent's territory instead of creating your own, and so you ended up with many small, inefficient groups.  Often taking the time to secure a territory or reinforce stones allows you to play aggresively in sente later.

I'd draw particular attention to moves 17 and 69.  Both were good ideas, but made too early, before your surrounding position could deal with the fallout.  Moves like this are almost always gote, and costly at that!

You'll find that professional players rarely attack before they've established a base for their own stones, and it's a good rule to go by! 

The other thing I noticed was that in several places you reinforced a group which was already rock solid.  When you make conservative plays like O3 or B11 the advantage you get is that you don't have to answer later moves.  When you answer them, you give up that advantage.

I very much enjoyed reviewing your game, and I hope my comments are useful!]
)
(;B[dm]SQ[ah][bi][ci]C[Julian: I think this point is your best bet for living without losing the tail at D6.  Without some sort of threat to catch the D8 stone (and make C7 a real eye), this group is too easy to attack.

W can capture the marked stones in gote, but at least he doesn't get the tail!

This was an excellent life and death problem!]

This move is also, in a deeper sense, sente.  In the immediate, you give up the initiative, but down the line you're going to get sente because W won't have his own sente attacks against K17.

Now if you can just diminish the upper left before W reinforces it, this is looking promising!]
