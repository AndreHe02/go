[ek]C[A small move, even  if it did work.  A move around `a' is probably the biggest point,
and a move around `b' also looks nice.];B[po];W[pn];B[oo];W[ql]M[qj]C[Still small.  This third  line territory is fairly well confined by the marked stone.]
;B[nm];W[mc]C[Good.];B[dc];W[cc];B[dd];W[de];B[di];W[ch];B[fi];W[ci];B[gf]
;W[rh]L[gm][mf]C[Now that B has pushed you down to the third line, the left  side is not terribly big.
B still has pretty good fourth line potential on the bottom, and his center  moyo
could be huge.  I'd highly recommend protecting your access to the bottom and  center  areas with `a.'  If you want to focus on the top, avoid getting enclosed in  the
corner.  Perhaps `b.'];B[me];W[pi]M[qj]L[ni][ld]C[Small.  This area  is not likely to be white or black territory, and B can afford to  drop back to `a,' letting you have the marked stone in gote.  Your stones  become
over-concentrated, and black gets to defend the center moyo at `b.'];B[ld]
;W[lc];B[kc];W[nd];B[pj]C[Mistake by B, I think.  Better to abandon this  stone and seal the moyo.]
;W[oi];B[qc];W[qd]M[mc][pd][qf]L[rd]C[Funny...I was  just working this situation out on a board (the marked stones) with  a stronger player, and we decided that black dies if white plays `a.']

[ck];W[dj];B[ej];W[dk];B[al];W[bk]L[bl]C[The usual response is to hit  on top of the monkey jump at `a.']
;B[bl];W[cl];B[bj]L[bm]C[This is a mistake by B.   Cut off the monkey jump stones and squeeze.  See variation.]

(;W[cj];B[ak]C[You can still cut him off and squeeze.];W[bi];B[an];W[aj]
;B[bn];W[bm]L[jk]C[Extremely small.  You're losing access to the center, and it's  getting huge.
How about `a,' threatening to connect either to the left or the upper right?
(Living independently, if that's the only choice.)];B[am];W[ap];B[fm];W
[fl];B[em];W[el];B[gl];W[dh]C[Small.  The big points are out in the center.]

;B[hp];W[hq];B[kq];W[jp];B[lr]L[kr]C[I think this should have  been a straight descent at `a.']
;W[gq];B[fp];W[jr];B[gr];W[hr];B[gs];W[hs];B[fs];W[kr];B[lq];W[ks]C[Well done.]
;B[kp]C[A mistake by B.  This is  only an 8 point move, and he should really save what's left
of his moyo.];W[ir]C[Not necessary.  J1 and J2 are miai.];B[qh]C[B is too  greedy.]
;W[qi];B[qg];W[rg];B[mi];W[nh]L[mg]C[You *must* get into that moyo.  Try  something daring, like `a.']
;B[mh];W[oj];B[pk];W[nj];B[nk]L[mj]C[Wrong side.  B should block at `a.']

;W[ne];B[mf];W[md]L[db][rj]C[Very small.  Consider `a' or `b.'];B[kb]
;W[ei]L[lb]M[kb]C[Small again.  A  monkey jump from the marked stone will cost you roughly eight points,
so I think it would be wise to block at `a.'];B[fj];W[db];B[eb];W[da];B
[na];W[lb]M[qc]L[nb]C[Probably better to just attach on top, at  `a.'  However, the marked stone makes
things tricky.];B[la];W[ma];B[mb];W[nb];B[ma];W[oa];B[ka];W[ob];B[pm];W
[rj];B[qm];W[rm];B[rl];W[rn];B[rk];W[pr];B[fe];W[le];B[kd];W[kk];B[ke]L[lk]C[Black should have just cut at `a.'];W[ki];B[jj];W[lk];B[jk];W[kl]
;B[jl];W[ml];B[lm];W[mk];B[nl]C[Very small for black.  This is worth only one point.]
;W[km]C[Equally small.];B[sj];W[ri];B[si];W[sh];B[sk];W[rf]L[re]C[Probably unnecessary.  If black cuts, just atari at `a.']
;B[eh];W[eg];B[fh];W[ef];B[ee];W[ek];B[ea];W[cb];B[ao];W[cp]L[ar]C[I like `a' better.  The 1-2  points are often critical in situations like this.]
