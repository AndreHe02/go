[this move makes it hard for white to  get a base down this side];W[om]
;B[np];W[jq]C[this  is a light move that has left the white stones at R7 perhaps a bit too soon.   You can build up your framework and press on them at the same time with a  move to N10 or N9, rather than K16.]

[lq];W[kl];B[lm];W[mo];B[km];W[kn];B[cj];W[ch];B[cn]C[this invites an invasion at C8, but this  wouldn't be bad if your aim were a nice wall keeping white down]
;W[co];B[dn];W[cl];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[bj];B[cm]C[I would have played C7 at D10,  protecting the center from a white cut there.  White, however, missed it.]

(;W[ci];B[dj];W[bk]C[white gave up sente with this  connection, probably nervous about the cut at B11, but that's not a problem  (just connect at B9 then).  At this point, white is vulnerable in a few  spots, and you are strong.  G10 moves towards connecting the wall on the left  to your central group, and begins to claim space in the center, but it  returns sente to white.  Your thick wall can take care of itself for now, but  it mightfeel better to extend first (as you did later in the game) (option  b) before attacking the upper right group]

(;B[gj];W[lh];B[lj];W[nl];B[nk];W[oi]C[next you press  up to N12.  You are very strong through the middle, so thick it has  territory.  With it this thick, push white towards your thickness, and you  will also plug up a hole in your upper area of influence (option b, c, or  d)]

(;B[mh];W[ql];B[oj];W[mg];B[nh];W[ng];B[li]C[white should connect at M13.  He may  feel splitting black up above to be worth it ... maybe something will come of  the isolated stone or the corner, but he gives you a lot of center from this.]

[jg];W[ld];B[mc];W[lc]C[I would have played S16 at R16 ... your corner  seems vulnerable ...]

 JamesL 23k*: is entering byo-yomi
I would have played your next move one more line closer to the edge at S10,  trying to deny a base.  You would have lost the stone at Q12, but you retain  a _good_ chance of nailing the white group.]

[sm]C[white playing along the first line is really  odd ... enough to get attention.  Life is being aimed for with a move at S8.   You need to play there if you are aiming to kill.  If you think white has a  good chance of getting two eyes and you are aiming to contain, play S5 rather  than T5]

(;B[so];W[qn];B[po];W[nn]C[
 oudeis 24k*:  this grp is so dead
white just gave you an extra move ... curious.  Perhaps he didn't see that S8  gives life to his group.  Your next move at M4 indicates concern at being cut  off, but it won't happen (at least, not that I can see).  black at S8 kills  white.]

(;B[lp];W[sn];B[ro];W[rl];B[rn];W[rm]C[
 oudeis 24k*:  what's really going on?
 oudeis 24k*:  that was ridiculous
it's really disappointing when something lives when you expect to kill it,  and then a move like T10 happens.  Better to play it at T11.  T11 is worth  two points more than T10, and white has to respond.]

;B[eq];W[gq];B[fq];W[gr];B[kr];W[jr]C[black's next move at K4 maybe hopes to set up a cut  or forcing move at J2.  Right now, though, it gives sente back to white.   better would be to play F7 or H13.]

(;B[jp];W[gn]C[no need  to connect yet, nothing sneaky can happen until white moves underneath your  stones on the third line.  F6 is safe to play and stops white from worming  into your space.]

(;B[dh];W[di];B[ei];W[hh]C[your black group below is  alive, and your black group above is alive, so there is no need to fill this  connection.  white J11 could dent your territory, so I would play there]
