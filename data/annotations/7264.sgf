C[willmo [6k\]: hi
Hieth [10k\]: Hi have a good game

Claude Brisson> So you're black. Let's review your game.];B[qd]
C[willmo [6k\]: why no handi?];W[dd]C[Hieth [10k\]: lol i don't want any]
;B[pq];W[dq];B[oc];W[qj]
(;B[qo]C[willmo [6k\]: we should plan to take a pattern and review it after the game

CB> white can tenuki now, since it can make eyes on both sides - see var]
;W[qg]C[Hieth [10k\]: ok

CB> white is not threatened, he should play elsewhere];B[co]
;W[cp];B[do];W[fq];B[ck];W[cg];B[fd];W[fc];B[gc];W[ec];B[hc]
LB[kc:C][gd:A][hd:B]C[CB> it leaves the cut at G16 - standard responses are A and B, or, if you want to play lightly here (not a bad idea), play C]
;W[lq];B[iq];W[nq];B[kp];W[mn];B[mp]LB[ql:A][jm:B]C[CB> too soon - white will reinforce himself, even if he has to give up one stone
CB> other options would be A or B];W[lp];B[mq]
(;W[ko];B[jo]C[CB> the weakness at K4 is too ennoying, you shoud play more solid, like K4 (you're helping white when you play contact moves here, since he will always escape anyway)]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[kn]C[CB> white has a good shape, and black must defend on both sides]
;B[np];W[jn];B[ho]C[CB> good];W[in];B[gp];W[gq]C[CB> you escaped, no more territorry around here, you should tenuki (and play on the top side for instance)]
;B[fp];W[hq]C[CB> white should also tenuki...];B[hp];W[io];B[ip]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[bp];B[hr]C[CB> that's a yose move, there are still big empty areas on the goban]
;W[gr];B[ir];W[mr];B[nr];W[or];B[oq];W[lr];B[ns]C[CB>too small - still yose moves! leave them for later]

(;B[op]C[CB> no need, it's not a weakness (and in fact you are loosing liberties, see var)]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[rq]C[CB> without P4 you could atari from the other side]
;W[qr];B[pr];W[rr];B[sp];W[qm]
(;B[rm]C[CB> no - this is gote - the main point is to capture white, not to try to make territorry while in the middle ofthe fight]

Hieth [10k\]: Sure
willmo [6k\]: w try to make complications
willmo [6k\]: usually, w not "give" anything away
Hieth [10k\]: :) i saw my false eye and counted it as a liberty
Hieth [10k\]: lol
willmo [6k\]: the 2 corners were b's tp keep, so w challenge b to see how b fight
Hieth [10k\]: i see
willmo [6k\]: when w start ko and let that center connection go, b should be suspicious
Hieth [10k\]: so black has the advantage
Hieth [10k\]: in general
willmo [6k\]: in the corners - b played as many stones in each as w did
