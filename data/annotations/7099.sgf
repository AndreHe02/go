vmtleh: Weird. But let's talk after game.
SwampBug: k
SwampBug: :)];B[ed]LB[pc:2][cd:4][ed:5][cp:3][pp:1]C[vmtleh: In the first game SwampBug beat me by taking a big territory in the centre area. So in this game I tried to notice if he is trying to close the centre.]
;W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[cf]C[This is a joseki. I didn't even know it but at least I've figured something out!

A wery simple and common one to. I like to use it as B because ppl say i'm good at reducing moyos.
But Iknow freinds that hate it, they say W get to big corner. B kind of have to play somewhere J-M16 or at least in that area, given the situation.
If B doesn't  W should attack around K-L16 he could also take it easy and play N16, both for aim to attack and build territory. The drawback i see is that it's a bit slow and if B answer around K-L16 it feel wery passive, though B plays K-L16 W gets sente.
The whole play feel ok, but W should perhaps be more agressive then N17.]

(;B[ic]TR[jc]C[SB: Why not here?

VMTLEH: I did a two-point jump instead of a three-point jump because I feared SwampBug would move between my stones with "H17" and somehow live. SB made a three-point jump in the very same kind of situation in move 16 and I could move between. But probably SB is right in here. A Three-point jump might have been better.

SB: A three stone extension from a two stone wall is standard so I'm pretty sure that a three stone extension would be proper here.


I rather go with J17, K17 leaves aji at H17-18 that can be huge endgame moves. See variaton at move 11.]
;W[eq]
(;B[dq]C[Ok move if it's followed by C6 or 7. The C4 leaves aji at B3, thogh it's more of a BIG ko-threat. 
This shape at B on 4-4 point leaves a wery fun 3-3 invasion for W if timed right. Therefor i recomend to read it out compleatly before playing it, one step to the side may not always work as it did this time.]

(;W[ep];B[do]C[Um, what the heck is C4 doing on the board....
C6 or 7 is a must.];W[iq]C[If B at D4 (solid wall) J3 might be to far with it's aji at G3. Now W at D4 makes so much aji that G3 or 2 becomes almost pointless.
Put in 2 variations.
See move 28 for better illustration.]
(;B[cl]C[localy it's an exelent move, though it feel like to many stones taking the same points.]
;W[qn];B[nq];W[rp];B[qq];W[qk]C[this is joseki to :)];B[qe]
;W[qg]TR[pe][og]SQ[qi]C[VMTLEH: Again a three-point jump made in the third line by SB and it worked well. But the situation is not the same as in moves 11 and 16.

SB: Well here it was a double purpose move. And attack on the invading stone and an extension. If you'd tried to pincher R 13 I would have have extended out splitting two groups of stones or pressed the attack at Q 15.

W Q17 is trying to make something on the upper edge and has wery little with the R line to do. The way B plays is just what W hopes for. B at Q14 will trigger a N-O 17 move of W, so maybe better for B to play O17. 

PS.
I don't think as far ahead as i played out the O17 move, if i did i would be a high ranking pro, not the amatur 4 k player that i am.

(;B[qc];W[pd];B[qd];W[lc]
(;B[qf]C[B play a pointless move and give/forces W to make a wall, a wall that W really, really, really wants anyway. Simply put B made really unnecessary move...
I always rather give up then ask for undo, but here would ask and if answer is no i give up.]
;W[pg];B[ci];W[pb];B[qb];W[qa]C[endgame move is for end game only. B lives if he doesn't do some major bad moves. B should live even if B screws up...]
;B[ra];W[pa];B[rc];W[jb]TR[gg][ig][gi][ii]SQ[hb][ib]C[SB: Perhaps an undercut here?

That would be wery intresting and it should be followed up by E13 or probe somewhere in the triangeled marked area.]
;B[ib];W[pf];B[kq]SQ[ke][kf][kg]C[Was Q 14 for L 3 a good exchange for white?

Only if it's followed up by a stone in marked area.
The cut at Q15 get dangerus if B get a stones around tengen.]
;W[eo]TR[di][jj][lj]SQ[bh][oi]C[SB: White gave up sente with this, in retrospect I don't think it was such a good idea? Maybe B or C 12 or B13 instead?

VMTLEH: I think also this was not an optimal move. White doesn't really got anything. But as white, I might have played "P11" to get a lot of territory and secure that three-point jump or play "B12" as SB already suggested.

SB: I don't know about P 11, seems to passive since I have a lot of strenth in that area. Maybe I should have tried to reduce the side group more. D 11? Or just jumped out into the middle with K 10 or N10?

Quite a lot can be sad about this move but the E5 this is just as bad as R14. Almost anyway.

P11 is to close to Q-wall and R9.
B12 is small but ok to play if W aims for B10 or something.
D11 to makes fight in no mans land is kinda pointless. It could easily mess up the entire board if it spreads to F9 and down or along the 14-12 line and strait in to what W is hoping to make territory.
K10 is better at L14 same result.
N10 is wery good but needs L14 or P6, get both and it's an overwhelming victory for W or rather panic for B.]
;B[dr]C[I SAD endgame moves are for endgame only ;-)];W[dn]
C[ VMTLEH: I think this just added more bricks to black's very useful wall. There wasn't any changes to get through and the move didn't really help white to get anything.

SB: Agreed.

Yep.];B[cn];W[er];B[bg];W[bf];B[cg];W[dd];B[go]C[Nice, really nice. W get 2 point instead of 5-10 maybe more.]

(;W[es]C[SB: White's biggest mistake of the game. I wasn't paying attention and thought I could kill the corner group. Sure paid for it.

VMTLEH: Losing sente here was bad. Instead of "E1" white should have played "G3" or "G4", I think.

SB: Definitely. I think G3 would have been best .

H3 looks more fun for W];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr];W[en];B[hq];W[gn]
;B[ip];W[fl];B[df];W[de];B[ef];W[ee];B[fe];W[ff]C[VMTLEH It think this move just made white to run and black could make his groups stronger by running after.

SB: Possible, but this helped me deny the influence of your left side, and I had to try something after the debacle in the bottom corner. This also helped me establish the massive territory on the right.

W could also just treat it as a probe or give it up.
A good advice is : Don't run with a dead group, run to a dead group.]
;B[gf];W[fg];B[dh];W[gg];B[hf];W[hg];B[if];W[lf]C[SB: I feel like this was a good move, though I don't know if I should have gotten away with it.

VMTLEH: A Very good move for white. It made a lot of territory. I didn't notice in game that white could get a lot of territory by making two walls: around Q-line and around M-line. It's hard to attack between them. "M14" also attacks my upper group or reduces it's influence.

SB: Thanks!

Should have been play at move 41 or so. :-) But it still is a wery good move.]

(;B[kn]TR[mh]C[SB: Should black have played here?

VMTLEH: The purpose of black's move was to get territory around "M5" and reduce white's possible territory. But "N12" would have been much better.

N12 is ok but L6 at P6];W[mh]C[VMTLEH: And here white sealed black. The best move in the game.]

(;B[po]TR[nk][om]C[VMTLEH: So here is what I tried to. I got about ten points but it's far lesser than "N12" would have been worth of.

(;B[nn];W[nm];B[mn];W[mm]C[VMTLEH: With these moves white made more territory than black.

SB: Yeah, I felt this sequence made my stones very efficient.

Sort of, B already got O3 so it feels smaller than it is, but still W gains slightly more thanks to N12.
aka. B and W gets about the same amount of points but B could have taken more then W. That way B feel W is playing efficient.]

It's of course possible to save white group even when black can make first two moves if you notice what black is after. Because of that, I decided first secure my upper group.
