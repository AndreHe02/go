;B[pd]C[Hi!

I will comment for both players. Pls. let  me know if you have any questions or  problems with the review. Let me know if I  can forward it to GTL and to your  opponent.

Goran];W[dd]C[The Oppening;];B[dp];W[oq]LB[dj:B][jp:A][jd:C]
[pj:D][qp:E]TR[dd]C[This is a good moment to study the  board. Black diamond marked stones  wish to extend in the direction of A,B,C  and D. Hoshi stones are indiferent to the  side. The same goes for the white triangle  marked stone (B,C). As for the white 5,3  stone it's sole extension is in the  direction of A. If white completes the  shimari with E then D becomes the  extension side.]

(;B[qf]LB[fc:A]C[The extension direction of stones is a  very helpfull tip as to what to do in the  oppening. Black move shows he's not  sure what to do here. Let's look at some   possible variations...]

(;W[gc]LB[fq:A]C[So the game continues in an unrealted  fashion. White should have played A.
See var.];B[qp]C[It is rarely a good thing to approach 3,5  stone like this. Black should have left this  and play k4 for instance - this lets white  make a shimari but is still better then  this.]
;W[po]C[Correct.];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm];B[qm]C[An error - black should have jumped here.]
;W[pk]C[Simply extending above would be better...];B[pl]C[Good.]
;W[ol]C[Atari from the other side is unthinkable.];B[ql];W[fq]
LB[om:A]C[The problems of white jump show up  here. White hurries to aprroach leaving  weakness behind. White was afraid of a  black erasure move which would erase  his thickness but in making an approach  now there is no thickness to back his  move.]
;B[kq]LB[ip:A]C[I'd rather play at A as this is too low and  much closer to white stronger group than  to his lone stone - why attack a stronger  group?]

(;W[iq]LB[ip:A]C[White should have A.];B[ko]C[As black jumps white is obviously too  low.]
;W[mp]LB[lp:A]C[At least at A.];B[lp];W[ok]C[Not the best time to play away from the  fight.]
;B[mq];W[np];B[qk]C[This side is an unimportant area.];W[io]
C[Good.];B[km];W[im];B[in]C[A mistake.]
(;W[hn]LB[jn:A]C[Another mistake. What was wrong with A?
See var.];B[jn];W[cn]C[This time leaving weakness behind  seems resonable.]
;B[co]C[This just helps white.];W[dn];B[dq]
(;W[dj]LB[fn:A]C[Perhaps playing at A would be better - A  would take care of white weaknes here,  as for the left side see var..]
;B[ho]LB[hm:A][cd:B]C[If playing here black should A. Otherwise  B would be better.]

;B[dl]C[Strange...]
(;W[cl]C[This is o.k. but I'd play more agresive  here.];B[dk]

;W[ce];B[ci];W[cj];B[di]C[Pushing from behind];W[ei];B[dg];W[be]

;B[eh];W[fi];B[fh];W[gi];B[gh];W[hi];B[hk]C[Interesting...]
;W[hh];B[gf]LB[fe:A][ef:B]C[Black should have played A. A forces  white to respond on the top in addition it  guards the point B which is blacks eye  shape point.]
;W[ic]C[I dont understand this - why not a longer  extension?]
;B[hg]LB[lc:A][pi:B][pr:D][ej:C][ee:E]C[Black has other nice points on the board  like A,B or even D. If however this aimes  at the cut at C black should settle his  group in sente with E then cut.]
;W[qc]LB[pc:A][nc:B]C[A or B are much better options for white  here.]
;B[pc]C[Correct.];W[qd]LB[pb:A]C[Should be at A to aim at ko.]
