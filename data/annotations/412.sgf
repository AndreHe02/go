WR[3k*]HA[0]KM[5.5];B[pd];W[cq];B[qp];W[cc];B[oq]C[not a bad move,but seems like passing over an opportunity. pressing at d16 would work perfectly with your hoshi on top-right.];W[pj]C[this starts a bit strange sequence. by playing high W declares - 'I don't want a solid based position here, but something light. ' - and immediatey contradicts that.]
;B[ql]C[a big extension, but extending from strength. r12 or r13 are better. always look for the 'sensitive' areas - near unsettled groups, or in open space. stay away from strong positions.
that is bexause extending from strength only gets territory; r12 or r13 would also strengthen your star-point. play where the gradient of the position is biggest.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[qj]C[if W wanted a solid position, playing the splitting move on the 3rd line was correct. here he spends 3 moves for not enough more.];B[fp];W[jq];B[lq]C[too easy on W. W will settle his stone here easily since your f4 is not strong. so better to play m4 if from that direction at all - m4 would make it harder for W's positions to work together. imagine the line k3-q10.]
;W[pn];B[ol]C[good.];W[qn];B[rm];W[ro]
(;B[rp]C[greedy, clingng to what you think is yours. pressing from o6 is much stronger.
you let the strength of r10-q10 look good.
see variations.];W[on]C[W let's you off the hook. he should jump ahead.]
;B[nk];W[ok]C[terrible move. W ends in gote and B gets ahead in the race .]

(;B[lc]C[the o16-q16 formation translates most easily to power, not territory. also, f18 destroys
territorial prospects here. you let l16 look like kikashi. W can now jump lightly toward his left position, matbe sacrifice some stones, neutralize your line 7 thickness and aim at r17 later.
again, imagine the line l16-p10.
see varation.];W[kc]C[bad... heavy, nothing doing - territorial prospects here small...]

you pay with territory to get influence, like in d16, you should get dividends.]
