C[Hello, I'm Julien, 1k on KGS. I will add comments and variations into this SGF file. Hope this will help you.]

(;W[qf]TR[qn]C[Since there is the triangle stone on the right, the top side is more interesting. So O17 is better than R14.]
;B[nc]
(;W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]TR[qf][qn]C[All on the 3d line: that is a flat development.]
;B[cf];W[df]C[Strange move. This joseki is usually good for white if white may develop a moyo on the top (in particular with stones around Q16 and K16). There is no such stones here.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[dg];W[de];B[dh];W[hc]C[Seem a bit close of the white wall. J17 or direcly M17 looks better.]
;B[dk]C[I have to say that your fuseki was rather bad: you're late now. You have no prospect on the right because you're too low, and no prospect on the top neither, because your extension is too small.]

(;W[no]C[maybe a 3-3 invasion would have made more sense?

Yes, it would be. Or just F3 (see variations). Your move is slow here: since you're low on the right, you cannot expect to develop a moyo (that's why your fuseki here was bad).]
;B[ok]C[I was not sure how to handle this stone

You're right: handling this stone is uneasy, but... I think the only good way to handle it is tenuki :-). Indeed, this black move is really bad and has no clear significance: it does not destroy any white point, nor build anything for black. So, if black adds a move, it will only create a weak group, if he doesn't, he has just lost a move.

So go to the bottom-left now.

Hint: when you don't know how to handle a stone, tenuki is often a good variation.]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[lp]C[(a missclick)];B[jq];W[lq];B[lr]C[This exchange was bad. You destroy only 1 point. Maybe there will be something better latter, At least, you lose a ko thread.]
;W[qk]C[That's only few points. Still go to the bottom-left.]
;B[gq];W[kc]TR[lc]SQ[cp][cq]C[maybe the triangled move is better to put pressure on the top right group?

Yes it would. But you have to go to the bottom-left because black area becomes very big. C4 (or C3) is an easy point for invading.]
;B[cq]C[Too late :-(.]
(;W[of]C[S17 is definitly the only move if you want to attack the top-right group: it is big in itself and, if black plays S17 himself, he will be alive.]
;B[em];W[md]TR[dg][dh]C[I have the feeling that I used up too many moves here for too little compensation. I perceived this as attacking a weak group and building my moyo in the process. Still I don't think that worked all too well. :)

S17 is the only move in this area. You don't have a moyo here because of the D12-D13 stones and the black strengths on the left (and there is still P9).]
;B[rc]C[Black easily lives.]
(;W[qd]C[Bad. What is the purpose of this move? That is only yose...]

;B[pb];W[oc];B[rb];W[na];B[qa];W[pc]C[this seems very small in hindsight

Yes it is... But not that's much because of the remaining ko at Q19.]
;B[ig];W[go]LB[kk:C][kn:D][jo:A][hp:B]C[I really didn't know how to decide here and I think I made one of the wrong moves.  I marked a couple of moves I considered but didn't play.  How should I reduce/invade white's center? Should I try to kill the N9 group?

I thought the Q19 ko would be too small to play right away, then forgot to play it at all. :(

You're right that reducing black moyo is urgent and bigger that playing Q19. But your move is far too deep with all these black stones around. The limit is A here. Any point further you will certainly die. I would play C here: attacking when invading is a good strategy: either you will capture some black stones, or you will destroy a large part of the black moyo.]

;W[mg]C[I usually don"t know how to handle these situations well. (Defending inside my moyo or territory)

Your moves are almost ok here. The usual strategy is: first enclose your opponent and force him to leave as small as possible in gote (or kill him :-)).]

[gf:3][gj:A][qr:2]C[I don't think this move makes much sense. What would be a large move here locally?

Yes, this move is small. Locally, A is the best I think. That is the beginning of the yose now. I think the biggest yose move are 1, 2, 3, 4 and A.]

;B[gl];W[qs];B[ps];W[rs];B[ni]C[Summary:
- fuseki: play more dynamically and not that flat.
- chuban: 
    * be careful of your opponent moyo: invade it before that becomes too late. 
    * do not invade too deeply, try to choose an invading point that also stresses your opponent on its weaknesses.
- yose: try to keep sente; do not always answer to your opponent moves.

I hope that this review will be useful for you. Do not hesitate to ask me additional questions.
