C[Hello.
 Thanks for reviewing my game.  I'm Black here, 25kyu or so,
I guess.  Unsure
of my true rank, as I play mostly online.  I've been reading
about moyo and
thickness, and I thought things were going well, and then white
poked some
holes...

REV: I'll do my best.


CR: Hello, my name is Christian Reiling, I am German 1 dan.
      I'll try to review the review.];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[ce];W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[oc]
(;B[nd]LB[gc:C][pj:B][me:A]C[At
this point I'm pleased with the joseki.  Should I be? what is
most important
next.  Perhaps an extension along the top, f/g/h17?

REV:  I'm not really that good at openings, but as long as the
thickness you have created doesn't go to waste, this looks like
a good result to me.

If white continues to ignore C15, something like you mentioned
seems sensible.


CR: Black's stone is usually played at A, instead. See variation.
Difficult to say, who is better here. Btw, it is nice, that black
thinks about his next move, but the fact is, it is white's turn!
Thinks like sente and gote are very important in go - beginners
often ignore that.
Black's thickness shouldn't be overestimated, since there is
no black stone around B! G17 is a very good idea, if black would
have sente now :)! Surely g17 is an extension, but much more
important it is a sever pincer!];W[mc];B[md];W[lb]LB[ld:A]C[CR: No good idea! W is already alive, crawling on 2nd line brings
far less territory to W than the thickness black gets!];B[kc]
C[REV: From this point on, I doubt whether the moves played are
really large enough.  I don't quite see why white is running
along the second line, and I also don't quite know whether you
are getting much out of following him.


CR: This is very true, but black's following him is good and
prevents an atari. Now I would say that black is far better here.]
;W[kb]C[CR: Bad for the same reason.];B[jc]LB[pj:A]C[CR: Good for the same reason!
Black's thickness is now very impressive, although without a
stone at A.];W[rd]C[CR: Useless and only strengthens blacks superb position!]
;B[re];W[rc];B[qf]C[REV: This move is fine, but you now have a situation where you
have huge influence, and he has large unassailable territory.
I don't quite know how it will pan out, but you will have to
use the influence correctly to make this kind of situation worth
it.


CR: Yes, this is indeed the right move here!
I would say: 15 points of territory compared to 30 points of
thickness!];W[gc]LB[ch:F][bc:E][jb:D][ep:C][jp:B][qm:A]TR[ce]
SQ[gc][dc]C[I felt ok here, ready to build a good moyo.

REV: Yes, but G17 is sente with respect to C15 (I think).  After
all, if you had just played C15, and white had responded G17,
it would have been slightly weird not to respond, in my opinion.
(Disclaimer:  I am not that good at openings, maybe you can have
this review reviewed by a dan player, and send me a copy?)

CR: I think this W's move is very good here.
What now? Should black care about the single marked (triangle)
stone? Is this stone important? I would say: no!
The moves D and E are miai, so the two marked (square) white
stones are safe! This means the marked black stone cannot be
used to attack! So surviving with the marked stone could be interesting,
one might state. But I think also this is not that interesting
and not that urgent at this state!
At this state of the game, black should make full use of his
thickness. Therefore he should consider a move like A, B or C
!
I think, I would probably play B here.];B[pj]TR[jc][kc][lc]
[qf][re][qd][pd][od][nd][md]C[CR: Not bad, but not perfect, I think! This is, because the stone
is too near to the thick formation - overconcentration.
The proverb says: "Keep away from thickness!" - this also means
one's own thickness.];W[he]
(;B[je]LB[jp:C][jf:B][ld:A]C[REV:  How big is this move, compared to an extension from C15,
or an attack at, maybe, E3?  It is not a bad move in itself,
though.


CR: I am sorry, but I think it is a bad move. The cut at A is
nothing to worry about, see variation! If playing here is interesting,
B would be better shape. C is still my favourite move here.]
;W[og]LB[mg:B][lh:A]TR[pj][je]SQ[oj][ni][lg][mh][kf]C[REV: Now white is trying to neutralize the influence you built
up in the opening.


CR: But this is far too deep and a bad overplay!
Look at the two marked black stones! Imagine a line between them.
Everything outside the line would be ok for reducing - everything
inside the line would be too deep and therfore an overplay.
A is for example ok, while B is too deep!]
(;B[pg]C[CR: :) - this is how black can make white happy.
See variation!];W[oh]C[I
didn't know which way to push him here.  Looking back, I think
I should have
been mor aggressive.  I did not use my thickness here as well
as I could
have.

REV: I might consider keeping him away from the edge, and forcing
him to run a bit (see variation)]
(;B[oj];W[oi];B[nj]C[REV: These were good moves, as you make more influence for yourself.]
;W[of];B[jp];W[mf]C[CR: Too near - still almost dead!];B[mh]
LB[lg:A]C[CR: At A instead!];W[kf]C[CR: Good!];B[kh]C[Would k14
have been better?  I think so now.

REV: I agree!

CR: Me, too!


Then he takes L12, and I make shape at
M10?  Good shape bad shape, I don't know.

REV: Seems a bit tenuous with N12 in place, though.];W[jf];B[if]
C[REV: Good, you keep him cut to an extent.

CR: Doesn't look very promising!];W[ie]C[CR: Yes!];B[hg]C[REV: Good:  Keep the cutting stone alive.

CR: Alive? Could proove as a burden.];W[jd]LB[ke:A]C[CR: Wrong side! White must play at A instead!]

(;B[le]C[Bad attempt to cut him up.

REV: Why not L15?  Keep the cutting stone alive, make white sweat
some more.


CR: L15 is not good - see variation! This move is indeed a good
one - threatening to cut!];W[lf]
(;B[ch]C[Black
47 was a guess.  the center felt full and i did not yet have
a base on the
left...  Suggestions for more important play?

REV:  THIS  was a big blunder.  (see variation)

CR: Why not L15 and keep on fighting?];W[ke]SQ[hg][if]C[Now white doesn't have to worry about his center group any more,
and the marked stones are still note quite safe.

CR: Yes, you are right!!! The marked stones, btw, are not very
important!];B[kd]SQ[kd][lc][kc][jc]C[This is a small move.  Sure, you save the marked stones, but
still, compare it with something like E3 or something along the
left side.


CR: ??? What was this good for ??? Taking an own liberty!];W[ic]
;B[eq]C[OK, so white thought it was sente, and you anyway get a big move
in!  ;-)

CR: Good move!];W[jb];B[ld]LB[cn:A]C[REV: This was maybe 13 points or so.  Not quite obvious that
you should ignore it, but not huge either!  He has given you
the opportunity to get a move ahead in the bottom left corner.
You should get more out of that, in my extremely humble opinion?

CR: Agreed! A looks very nice, instead!];W[qi];B[pi]C[Oops,now I'm worried about the stringy group on the top.  It
turned out ok, but it was nerve racking, and he gained on the
right.];W[ph];B[qh];W[rh];B[qg];W[qj];B[rg]LB[qk:A]C[CR: Ouch! Must be at A, instead!]
;W[ri];B[qk];W[rk];B[rl]C[double hane.  How does it play?  When is it appropriate?  Not
here I think.

REV:  I think you should ask a higher reviewer about when to
play it, but as you saw, clearly not here!

CR: Yes, not here!];W[ql];B[rm]C[CR: Good idea!];W[pk];B[pf]
C[CR: Taking a liberty!?];W[sg]C[CR: White is very kind towards black here - T14 instead!]
;B[sf]C[I guess it worked out, but I think he could have killed at Q15.
Lucky me.

REV: Quite right!

CR: Yes, luck is sometime very useful :) !];W[qm];B[rn];W[qn]
;B[ro];W[qo];B[qp];W[dm];B[ck];W[nq];B[oq];W[np]
(;B[mo]C[Black 83 was a guess.  I didn't know what to do.  Thought about
o6, m3, e5, etc.

REV: I would go for m3 (see variation).];W[jr]C[83 at m3 looks like it would have been better for me.

REV:  Clearly.  I don't see a good result for black here.  I
think you did reasonably OK after N5.];B[iq];W[ir];B[hr];W[jq]
;B[hp];W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[mp];W[mq]TR[cp][dm]C[I gave him a base here, but was happy to limit it as I did.

REV:  Well, you did limit the damage to your territory, but there's
still almost none left!

CR: Yes, blacks territory was extremely reduced - but black is
still ahead! Now attacking the marked stones becomes most important!]
;B[lo];W[oo];B[cr]C[CR: Great!!!];W[ek]SQ[hq][gq][fq][gs][gr]
[fs][fr][er][es][ds][dr]C[REV:  As I said earlier: you don't have much left after the white
assault on the bottom (11 points at an optimistic count!)


CR: Not the few points are important here, the weakness of the
white group is!];B[bm]C[Black 97 and 99.  Big or small?  Maybe they do not fit with the
moyo idea I had early on.  Then again, white already has some
stringy groups stretching into the middle.  I dunno...

REV: Well, they might not get you much territory, but they remove
a sizeable chunk of white territory (compare the board with white
peices there in stead of black ones!), so they soom good to me.

CR: Good moves!];W[cn];B[do]C[Black 101: small.  How about f7? or e10?  H9?

REV: I agree that this is not a very productive move.  Of the
moves you suggested I prefer H9, as it has some effect towards
the center group, but how about something like B17?  K13 also
seems to make some sense to me.

CR: To me it looks good - severe attack!];W[co];B[cm];W[dn]
;B[dl];W[el]
(;B[eh]C[Black 107: should have cut at e7?

REV: I definitely think so! (see variation)];W[hk];B[fm]C[Vulgar move!  Just cut and fight, right?

REV:  Definitely still cut.  The cutting stone would be healthy
and happy, but the center white group would be in very bad shape.
You are just forcing him to connect stones that he -wants- to
connect by playing F7.  You only do this kind of move if you
want to remove eyespace, or if you want to gain influence with
the move.];W[em];B[fn];W[gl];B[fl]C[REV: Now what is the point of this move?  You are not reducing
white's inavsion, nor removing eyes, nor disconnecting!];W[fk]
;B[gj];W[fj];B[gi];W[fi];B[fh];W[gk]C[Many small moves by me.

REV:  Indeed.  You seemed to hang onto the hope of killing white
for too long, and played too close.  If you had maybe kept your
distance you might have kept more territory.];B[bq];W[jh];B[ji]
;W[ih];B[hh]C[REV: J11 maybe here?

CR: Surely, J11 !!!];W[ii];B[ij];W[jj];B[kj];W[jk]SQ[dp][hj]
[ll][eo][hn][kn]C[cut to late.  no good.

considered, realizing this, are marked.];B[kk];W[ik];B[km];W[hj]
;B[ok];W[ol];B[nl];W[io];B[ip];W[jo];B[hm];W[jm];B[im]C[H6 better.  I got angry and greedy.]

I didn't know the score, but thought it would be close.  I definitely
did not make good use of my sanren-sei moyo ideas in the beginning.
What should I work on now?  Fighting and cutting?

REV:  I noticed that you pointed out a number of bad moves yourself
in your commentary.  I suggest you make a habit of, before you
put down a stone, thinking of one alternative -every time-, and
thinking of two possible responses by your opponent to each move
you make (except, of course when you are in bad time trouble
;).  This will alert you to obvious bad moves.  Also, when your
opponent is thinking, don't think direct strategy, instead, ask
yourself "Where am I going with this line?", such questions as
"am I killing anything here?"  "what territory am I going after?".

CR: Good suggestion. Just let me add a few.
"Are these stones important?"
"Should I try to kill him or try to safe my territory?"

I feel sorry for black loosing this game!
Black was to dominating in the beginning and lost focus until
the end.

I hope I could contribute some help with my comments.
