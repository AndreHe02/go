C[I played white in this game.  I never quite felt the game was going my way in this one -- I also felt he got away with a few moves (attachments on the bottom and top) to which I should have made stronger replies.  I'd really appreciate help in the opening and early middle game sequence especially.
MR: I agree with your feeling that black got away with his attachments in the lower and upper side too good.  There are some other places where you or both players missed the important area of the board. 
Altogether, I do not feel that the game was bad all the time for you and that everything worked according to your opponents liking. It is just normal in games when you have white that your opponent can choose "his" opening...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[pj];W[nc];B[qf]C[MR: Submissive. Normal would be M17.]
;W[jd];B[df];W[cd];B[cj];W[jp]C[I was wondering if I should have pincered on the left side, but this seemed the most important area of play.  Thoughts on this move?
I kept it high instead of at k3 to counter b's moyo potential.
MR: The move is fine. If you would have played C8, Black would have been happy to kakari at F3 or to play K4 to expand the lower side.]
;B[bf]C[MR: Strange. C6 would be the usual approach.];W[nq]
C[I thought about r6, but that is asking to be chased without much potential for profit anywhere.  Is this move ok?
MR: Yes, I think that your move is fine, as it extends your own side while reducing Black's.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[oq];W[no];B[op];W[mo]C[I connected here to keep b's right side from expanding toward the center.  But I'm not happy that it's too close to the k4 stone -- and that n3 still remains as a weakness underneath.  Was there a better move here?
MR: More or less, there is only the choice between connecting above or below. I think that it is a matter of taste in this position where to connect. Your choice allows a large black corner after the cut at N3. Connecting below induces a fight if Black cuts at N5.]
;B[pm]C[looks like everything is working well for b.
MR1: This move is usually played at Q6.
MR2: It is also not working bad for white, if white manages to play in the lower left first.]
;W[ne]C[I had trouble discerning whether this point  or somewhere on the bottom/left was more important.  The problem was that even one more move would not settle the bottom as territory.
MR: I feel that the lower left is more important, as you already reduced the potential of blacks moyo on the lower side with N5. In my opinion, C6 is too good for black.]
;B[cn]C[MR: As said, I feel that this move is too good for black.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[co];B[en];W[do];B[cm];W[fp];B[ip]C[MR: This move indicates that Black is not too confident with his position as well ... Otherwise he would probably close the corner in the upper right with Q18.]
;W[iq]C[Should I have played k3 instead?  If you could show me some likely possible sequences I'd really appreciate it.  I felt I should do better against b's attachment here, but wasn't sure how.
MR: J3 is the usual response. If you want fighting, you can also play K5, but here it does not fit well with the stones around N5.]
;B[hq]C[MR: This is the "usual maneuvre" that black intends when attaching at J4.]
;W[hp];B[io]
(;W[ir]C[MR: How about H5? The result in the next couple of moves is too good for black.
If H5, black can cut with K3 and then drive out the white stone K4, inducing a fight between this new black group and the stones around N5. But while running to the center, white will reduce the potential of black's right side territory.]
;B[gp];W[ho];B[go];W[hn];B[fq];W[eq]C[MR: This is a success for black.]
;B[fo];W[jn];B[fr];W[cq];B[er];W[dr];B[ep];W[hd]C[This doesn't feel right, but I was lost for a good move -- maybe r12 or q12?
MR: The move is not that bad. Unfortunately, after the black invasion on the lower side, blacks territry is larger then white's.]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[md];W[mc];B[lc];W[lb];B[ld];W[jc];B[nd];W[ei]
C[MR: After black has taken so much from white, white probably needs some harder methods, maybe inducing a fight with C13. Your move only asks black to secure his territory - what he is happy to do.]
;B[dh];W[mk]C[MR: This limits the black potential in the center, but does not produce territory. Still, I feel that some harder methods are called for, e.g. trying Q11 yourselve similar to black's maneouvres on the lower and upper side.]
;B[gn]C[MR: ?, not an urgent area.];W[hm];B[mi];W[lh]C[MR: Yes, white's only choice is to start fighting.]
;B[li];W[mh];B[ni];W[od];B[oe];W[oc];B[kf];W[kh];B[je];W[ih]
C[MR: Maybe K11. But running out is definitely the correct idea.]
;B[he];W[gd];B[pc]C[MR: Very big.];W[nr]C[MR: I am not sure that white has time for this move now. I think that white should first play with the aji in the upper right corner, e.g. by continuing with O12. The cut at Q15 with continuation R15 does not work directly, but the potential allows white to e.g. destroy part of the right side.]
;B[ge];W[qq]C[This was not];B[qp];W[or]C[I should have left the corner stone.]
;B[jj];W[hi];B[im];W[in];B[hk]C[MR: Now it becomes difficult for white to connect the group in the middle.]
;W[if];B[ie];W[ji]C[MR: Spontaneously, I would try to connect with G9.]
;B[ij];W[ki];B[kj];W[jg];B[fk];W[gg];B[fe];W[gj];B[gk];W[of]
C[MR: Could be aji keshi. I would start the operations in the middle of the right side directly.]
