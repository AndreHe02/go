C[no2k: I lost this game surely because of bad endgame moves. I think i have had good prospects after the fuseki. But i didn't manage to win. I think i am not able to turn thickness into territory. Where did i go wrong before the endgame?]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[op];W[eq];B[qp]C[no2k: I like this opening]
(;W[pj]C[[wund\] Usually on the third line (variation1)]
(;B[qh]C[[wund\] I would play on the other side (variation2)]
;W[qm];B[cp]C[no2k: Anything wrong with this move? Other  alternatives i was thinking about were P12 and K4.
[wund\] P12 looks like a thick move to me, a bit slow  perhaps. I would play K3 instead of K4, but all these  moves are possible. The kakari can't be bad]
;W[mq];B[ip]C[no2k: I want to separate the white stones.
[wund\] Yes, very good. Perhaps you should play at  H4 instead of J4, though. Your move is nicely  balanced but H4 puts more pressure on white]
;W[pq];B[pp]C[[wund\] Correct];W[oq];B[np]C[[wund\] VERY good. Permitting white to play there is  a sin :-)]
;W[nq];B[qq]C[no2k: Too slow? Better N4or M5?
[wund\] No, the only move. This is not just a matter  of territory (though it is a big move); if u let white  play there, u lose your base in the corner.]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[mp]
(;B[om]C[[wund\] This is the wrong direction of play. U made  thickness, and this is not the way to use it.  (variation3)]
;W[rj];B[oh];W[nj];B[eo]C[no2k: I would have liked to approach from my J4  Stone but i did not find a severe move.
[wund\] If your pincer was at H4 u might attach at E4.  Severe at this point would be attaching at D3, but  that might be an overplay. White might be slightly  ahead, because of your move at P7]
;W[gp];B[hq]C[[wund\] This is bad. The forcing move gains u  nothing, while white gets good shape. Better play  ikken tobi (at J6)]
;W[gq];B[im];W[gn];B[ho]C[no2k: To prevent the cut.
[wund\] Bad shape! It does prevent the cut, but what  will u do when white plays hane at H2?]
;W[go];B[dl];W[cq]C[[wund\] Slack];B[bq];W[cr];B[cf]C[[wund\] Excellent]
;W[br]C[[wund\] This is very bad. Though u made him strong,  he takes gote again :-)]
;B[bp]C[[wund\] U should play tenuki, though. That stone is  not important anymore :-)]
;W[jq];B[fc]C[[wund\] Very good];W[ee];B[hr]C[no2k: During the game i founf it necessary to keep  the groups separated. But is that right? They are  already secure.
[wund\] I agree completely (about the groups being  secure). Besides, this move doesn't work well  (variation 4)]

(;W[gr]C[So this move is irrelevant.];B[cc]C[[wund\] Let's evaluate the position at this point. The  only real mistake u made (H2) was compensated for  by white (G2). White took gote twice on the lower  side, which were in fact endgame moves, so at this  point u are safely ahead.]
;W[pl];B[rn]C[[wund\] White made a very slow move again.  Because u are ahead, u can afford to answer  likewise :-). But if you do so, taking the stone at Q2  is bigger, safer and more agressive.   Anyway, i would prefer to play in the upper left. Both  of you ignore this position for the next ... moves,  but connecting or cutting on either side is very large  in every sense.]
;W[nc]C[no2k: Aiming at R9.];B[kd]LB[pc:A]C[no2k: now the two D16 stones look thin. At this  stage i liked the game. But is it really ok?
[wund\] Yes, the game is good for you. But if u want  to attack the stones at D16 u should connect there.  As long as white can cut on either side he is under  no pressure.

Anyway, since u invested the two stones at R12 the  corner becomes very important; u should play at A  to take territory and deny white a base.]
;W[ne];B[pf]LB[pc:A]C[[wund\] Still, better at A];W[qc]C[[wund\] The only move]
;B[pc]C[no2k: When initiating this sequence, i felt good.];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re]
(;B[rf]C[no2k: With this move i wanted to confine white  completely to the corner, but the final result did not  look so good. Should i have better played at O18?
[wund\] No, O18 is not a good move. U should  try to swallow up the stones at O17 on a large scale  by playing at N12 (variation5)]
;W[qe];B[qf]LB[pe:A]C[[wund\] Even now, better to connect at A]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[nd];B[od];W[nb];B[oa];W[nf];B[of];W[sb]C[no2k: This result does not look very good to me.  How should i have played instead?
[wund\] As said, ikken tobi on the outside. As it is,  you have been badly forced :-((]
;B[ng];W[mg];B[mh];W[ni]C[[wund\] A very badly timed kikashi]
;B[lg]C[[wund\] very good];W[mf];B[nh];W[lf];B[kg];W[kf];B[jg]
;W[jf];B[ic]C[no2k: Now the position in the upper side doesn't  look bad for black. Is this right? The white stones  seem to form an inefficient shape to me. Should  white have played in another way?
[wund\] I disagree. U had a strong corner position;  white has invaded, lived with some territory and  completely destroyed what should have been your  compensation at the upper side. White has caught  up a bit, but u are still ahead]
;W[ig];B[ji];W[ie];B[qk]C[[wund\] This attack doesn't work well]

(;W[rl]C[[wund\]  The wrong response (variation6)];B[qj];W[pk]
;B[ri];W[rk];B[nl]C[[wund\] Very good. This is the vital point; white is in  real trouble now....]
;W[nk];B[ol]C[no2k: Now i think N8 or M8 would have been much  better.
[wund\] I think so too :-)];W[ml];B[lj];W[lk];B[mm];W[lm];B[ln]
C[[wund\] Many things can be said about this fight; u  both make some mistakes here. But so would  anybody who is not a pro :-)]
;W[mn];B[nm];W[kn];B[lo];W[kl];B[mj];W[mk];B[kq];W[jp];B[kp]
;W[ko];B[lp]C[[wund\] This is a blunder, though. This could have  been the losing move]

(;W[io]C[[wund\] White misses a chance here (variation7)];B[mo]
;W[hp]C[[wund\] Bad mistake. Since he can cut at either H4 or  H6 this is worse than a dame-point]
;B[pr]LB[kr:A]C[[wund\] Returning the favour :-). If u play at A he is  dead; if he connects around Q2, u can play a  monkey jump or something]
;W[jb]C[no2k: I was happy with that result. The O3 group seemed dead to me. (But that is not true.)]
;B[jc];W[kb]LB[dc:A][cd:B][dg:C][cg:D][dh:E][ch:F][cb:G][bb:H]
[eb:I]C[[wund\] This is the right time to estimate the score.  Counting is still difficult, because many positions  are unsettled yet, but since u were ahead before u  started your attack at R9, and the attack can be  considered succesful (even though the group on the  lower edge isn't captured yet), u ARE ahead.

When ahead, avoid trouble. Your only potential  problem is the stones at your upper side. If white  plays something like A...I u might even die! So, u  should consider playing at A]

(;B[na]C[[wund\] The wrong direction (variation7)];W[dc]

;W[lc];B[hf]LB[he:A][if:B][gf:C][hg:D][je:E]C[[wund\] Overplay. After A..E your group above is  dead]

;W[eg];B[hg];W[ii];B[gi]C[[wund\] This is to thin; better play at H12]

C[[wund\] This is making things worse....];W[eh];B[fj];W[ej]
;B[fk];W[kr];B[lr];W[lq];B[nn];W[jr]C[no2k: ? i didn't understand this move. N3 would  have rescued the O3 group.
[wund\] Quite right; a blunder];B[mr];W[or];B[qs];W[cj]
(;B[bj]LB[ek:A]C[[wund\] At this point the game is allready bad for  you. The stones around K17 can be cut off; worse,  your whole group is under attack. If u try to save the  side group with this move your large group might  easily die. I think u should play at A (variation?)]

(;B[bb];W[db];B[bd];W[ff];B[hg]C[[wund\] It looks strange, but u can connect on either  side if u play at B18. In this fight white is eyeless  and heavy, so u should have no trouble escaping]
