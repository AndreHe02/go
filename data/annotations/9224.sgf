going to the second line in the opening is usually wrong. it is true that he can remove your territory if you don't respond to 25, but your groups are already strong. for him to use sente to gain second line territory is not efficient.]

(;B[rl];W[rj]LB[ie:a][ip:b][fh:c][bf:d][cg:e]C[at this point, b has sente, should attack any weak groups from w, or reduce w's area, before building up.

i would play A or B.

A attacks w at top, which is not alive yet. B has many alive groups with access to the center, so this attacking group will have many places to run if in danger.

B reduces w at bottom and threatens to split the left group from the right at j2.

C is also possible, sealing in the left side w group, and also aiming at the points D and E which are worth poking at later to test w's life and death.]
;B[mf]C[this is too passive, not realising that bottom can be reduced and top w group can be attacked, possibly both in sente.]

;B[fg]LB[ip:a]C[way too slow. sente to capture one stone.

A is stil a very big move.

this is the last comment.

overall... i will end with 3 things.
1. when you have sente, look at the whole board and decide what to play. attack weak groups, then reduce, then build territory.
2. when your groups are in danger of being cut or captured, analyse the board situation if that group was cut or captured. it may not be a problem at all.
3. sometimes it's okay to let your stone on the first or second line be captured by a fighting group, because capturing it may not lead to an eye.

hope you found the review helpful.];W[qe];B[pe];W[on];B[no]
