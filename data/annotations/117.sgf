L[pf]C[jc> P13 at Q14 is the usual  move.P13 may seem to take more territory and influence the center but it  leaves behind weaknesses that 'a' would not.  This results in unneccessary  complications later.

We see later on that the P13 stone doesn't end up doing much work.];B[qn]
;W[nq];B[rp];W[qq];B[qk];W[qj];B[rq];W[on]M[rr]C[jc> P6 should be at S2.  White has already played 2 territory  oriented moves with R3 and O3 so he should stay consistent - don't change  horses in the middle of the street!  If white wanted to play for influence  then O3 should be at O4.

Since black can live easily, he should play on the bottom e.g. variation B.]

(;B[pk]C[jc> black's group is secure.  He should be playing on the bottom  where this is the most profit.]
;W[ok];B[rk];W[rj];B[ol]L[pm][nl]C[jc> white 28 must be the  double hane of 'b'.]

(;W[pm];B[om];W[fq];B[hq]L[cq][cn]C[jc> white should double kakari at C6 so that he will have a foothold  on the left side.

luckily for white, when he invades at C3 black blocks the wrong way.]
(;W[cq]C[jc> black should block at C4 and build a huge moyo on the left.]

(;B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[co];B[cr];W[br];B[jp]C[jc> K4 should be at C6 but since black  blocked the wrong way C6 doesn't look that great either ...]
;W[dn];B[fo]L[dr][en]C[jc>  white at D2 is a mistake.  Black has a powerful upper left side so white  should be thinking about playing at E6 in the middle.

E6 threatens to push through at E5 and kill the whole black corner while  establishing a more influential postion.]

(;W[dr];B[er];W[cs];B[en];W[dm]C[jc> luckily for white black has played poorly.  White has  taken the corner and a position on the side while black has nothing to show  for his moves on the bottom.]
;B[mm]M[lq][ck][ce]L[ce][ck][lq]C[jc> N7 is too small.  black should  apply pressure to the Q4 white group by playing M3.

C15 and C9 are also much better than N7];W[kq]C[jc> since the Q4 white group is weak I advocate playing the tighter  move of M3.    L3 would look much better if white already had the corner secure with S2.]

[jc> N15  is too passive.  black is strong here - he should play something like C9 or  F13 instead.]
;W[fg];B[eh];W[nk];B[ml];W[ck];B[lp]C[jc> if L3 was at M3 then  white could play N4 which makes better eye space.]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[ir];B[hr];W[fr]C[jc> white should take care for his Q4 group before playing F2.   Playing N3 or O4 are possibilities.]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[kr];B[nr];W[ls];B[oq];W[np]C[jc> white is lucky that he doesn't lose more here.]

;B[pn];W[mo];B[kp];W[gp];B[fp];W[gq];B[eq];W[es];B[iq]L[jr][kn]C[jc> since the white group on the bottom now has 2  eyes (n1 and m2)white should attack the black K4 group on the bottom.  The  object of this attack isn't to kill black - the object is for white's N6  stones to get out into the center and reduce blacks influence.  although if  black makes a mistake and dies on the bottom white won't mind :)]

(;W[jr];B[fl];W[gi]C[jc> white should be attacking on the  bottom.];B[km]
L[lj][pb][bi][jf]C[jc> M10 doesn't buy white much.

K14, Q18, B11 are all better moves.];W[lj];B[mh];W[nh];B[pb];W[qb];B[qc]
C[jc> if P13 was at Q14 white couldsimply play P18 and keep the corner and  the side.]

(;W[rc]C[jc> S17 should be R16.];B[nf];W[of]M[of][pe]C[jc> white should play  the bamboo joint of Q15 instead of P14]
