AB[pd][dp][pp]C[pls comment mostly for black.

Your only big, consistent weakness is playing away when a weak white group makes contact with your stones.  His contact play strengths you when you answer, so you usually want to answer (when his group is weak).  Otherwise you played quite well.

When you make a good wall, think about attacking a on a large scale.  Don't use yuor wall to make a small capture or take a small territory.]

(;B[ng]C[Since white left this group without finishing the joseki, you have the right idea to attack it.  This move is a good followup after the joseki, when white has made a base.  Since white didn;t make a base it is more important now to remove the base as in the variation.  If this group is not settled you can make a lot of points and thickness by chasing it.]
;W[pb];B[md];W[nd]
(;B[lf]C[The corner is big, and once white plays in the corner he is settled. I prefer to take the corner and chase white into the center.

Usually when you surround a weak group your goal is to make thickness in sente.  You surround him, he lives, and you take sente to use your outside thickness. In this game, you answer in the corner, so your surrounding mvoe is not sente.  The wall you make is weak since he can cut through it later when the ladder works.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[This move is good when you have a stone arounf K3 or K4.  Since you don't, a pincer is better.  When you ahve a stone around R10, the tight pincer is best since it will work well with your wall after white goes into the corner.]
;W[np]
(;B[jq]C[Here you try too hard to get both sides.  This move does not attack strongly since it gives white room for a small extension. White can reduce your right side because you didn't jump on the right.  If you make the kick move at P3, you have to continue with the jump on the right edge.

if you are unhappy with white extending on the lower side, then don't start with P3.  Make a pincer instead.

The pincer looks good beacuse you have a stone on the right side already, so if white goes into the corner your wall will work well.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[qq];B[qp];W[or];B[pr];W[pq];B[rq]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[op]C[Now white is settled with a thick group and took away most of the corner territory.  This is a great result for white.

In a handicap game white's goal is usually to make thickness without giving much territory so he can use his superior fighting skills.]
;B[pm];W[oj]C[This is a good reducing move.  You should look at answering to the right, or capping.  Answering is simple and gives you a lot of secure territory, and white doesn't get a very solid wall. Answering is probably fine for a handicap game.  In an even game I think black should cap and start a running fight.  If black gets some stones in the center he can play strongly on the left side.]

(;B[nn]TR[po][pn]C[The two marked stones are not important since they are not cutting anything.  Capturing them is a small endgame play, so of course white will not answer this move.

Letting white break up the right side is much, much bigger.]
;W[oh]
(;B[nf]C[This move is too easy for white.  The right side goes away and you still have several cutting points.  You can defend the right first with a peep.]
;W[qi];B[pj];W[pi];B[qg];W[rj];B[rk];W[ri];B[ql]
(;W[oo]C[Small.  White should strengthen his right side group or play on the top.]
;B[ni]C[Good.  you can recover now by attacking white strongly.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[oi]
(;B[mj]C[You are thick above, and thin below, so you should think about moves closer to bottom side.  The general strategy is to play near your weaker stones and away from your stronger stones when attacking.]
;W[mk];B[lk];W[nh];B[mh];W[nj];B[mi];W[ml];B[ol];W[nl]
(;B[ok]C[bad move, right?

Yes.  You have already destroyed the potential eye here, so the most important thing is to prevent white from connecting.  It's hard to make a strong attack now because of your previous move at N10.  Your stone at O6 is too weak.]
;W[om];B[nm];W[on]
(;B[lm]C[i forgot he connects! amnesia in action :)

your cutting stones are really important to keep the attack going. He can only make one eye by playing at S13, so want to continue to chase him.  this move must be at M6.]
;W[nk]
(;B[kn];W[pl];B[cl];W[en];B[el];W[gn];B[co];W[bo];B[bp];W[bn]
;B[gl]C[Good.  You are making good use of the wall you made on the right by making him run toward it.]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[cm];B[ck];W[ho];B[hq];W[hl]C[You have to answer this move to keep the pressure up.  If you play H9 white will answer and you can still play at D12.  Your group is not alive yet, so it's important to keep access to the center.  You want to keep up a one-sided attack against the group at C6.  You don't want to give any change to counterattack you C9 group.]

(;B[dh]C[This is too small.  If you can make a good wall below, you want to come in at c14 and capture this stone on a large scale.]
;W[gk];B[fk];W[gm];B[gj]C[This is really bad.  When white captures he will live in sente and you can only make a very small capture.  Yuor thickness here is wasted making just a few oints of territory.]
;W[fl];B[ek];W[hj]C[Now white is alive and your thickness on the right is wasted. You should answer this move to maintain yuor center thickness.]

(;B[cf]C[This is small.];W[ce]
(;B[fc]C[you have to answer on the left.  Once you play C14 you can't abandon it.

A general rule is that you can abandon stones that are enar enemy strength, but you have to save stones near weak enemy groups. when yuo are attacking.

In this game you gave up single stones during attacks at P3, G8, and now C14.  All were big losses.]
;W[bf]
(;B[db]C[Yo need to answer the last move.  You give up way too much on the left otherwise.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[df]C[If your plan is to let white capture C14, it's better not to play it at all.]
;B[fh];W[gi];B[fi];W[fj];B[ej];W[kb];B[cc]C[at this stage, white has almost no territory, except for the top right, so black feels comfortable.  what do you say?

Black still has a good game.  Black is ahead on territory and thickness is about even.  Black missed a chance to wrap up the game by giving up G8, but shold still win.

Notice that since white captured C14, white is stong enough here to ignore this move.]
;W[bq];B[cq];W[ap]
(;B[br]C[I would prefer not to give up a stone.];W[cp];B[dr]
C[d3 better, right?

Yes.  Generally it's better to make a solid connection unless you have a good reason not to, like to make eye shape.]
;W[do];B[lb];W[lc];B[kc];W[mb];B[jb];W[la];B[fe]C[Good idea to increase black's territory.]
;W[ff]
(;B[gh]C[Again you don't answer white's contact play.  It's better to answer.]
;W[hh];B[gf];W[ee];B[gd]C[Again I wold prefer the solid conenction at g15]
;W[ci]
(;B[ch];W[bh];B[di];W[cj];B[bj];W[bi]C[Do these forcing moves really help you?  They reduce your liberties, adn remove ko threats you might want later.]
;B[hg];W[ih];B[lq];W[ep];B[eq];W[dq];B[cr];W[fq];B[er];W[gp]
;B[fr];W[gq];B[gr]C[Now white is ahead.  Black lost a lot of points in the lower left. and upper center.

Remember that you let white live so yuo could make a small capture of D10, but now D10 has escaped, so you ended up gaining nothing.]
