C[this game was played on dashn.com

i'm black, 18kyu there, 15k@kgs, 20k*@igs

thank you for viewing my game!


karmaGfa:

I am 9k on KGS, I am not very good at opening so I cannot be 100% sure of my advices about it. My skill is more the fights. Anyway, I will do my best to comment your game.]
DM[1];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc];B[qk];W[qn]LB[ok:A]C[i'm not sure how to respond to the invasion of the low chinese opening like this...


karmaGfa : 

The stone in R6 is relatively weak. I think that P9 is a good move, it begins to make the pressuire against R6 and create a potencial territory on the upper-right side.]
;B[ok];W[on];B[np];W[rp];B[fq]LB[mn:A]C[too hasty?

should i press the q6 group more to make shape?
i'm not sure how.. so i was thinking, 'lets make territory @ the bottom'


karmaGfa : 

hum ... F3 too nasty ... hum ... yes and no.

"Yes" because the group in P6 can start to make pressuire on O4 and if you play against him, it is the reverse .. so a move in N6 could be better.

"No" because I win my games because I am nasty :-) 
It depends what kind of player you are. If you think you can live in O4 without helping him, you have to know that you may live little (to do little points only) and perhaps you will give to white a good influence on the center will he attack you.

let's say that it was more nasty that good.];W[qq]C[Here, white choose to establish a base for him to live.
It also means that he can start to surround the group in O4 in the next moves.]
;B[pp]LB[ic:C][ci:D][cn:F][dn:G][mn:A][fo:E][kp:B]C[

karmaGfa :

I think that Q4 is not a good move. there is a lot of more interesting moves elsewhere on the goban instead ...

... and Q4 is gote];W[eq];B[fp];W[jp];B[cn]C[k4 took the spot i was aiming for so i'm not sure about c6...


karmaGfa :

This move is a little agressive, but you have to be agressive sometimes, else you lose.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[cq];B[cj];W[ch];B[dd];W[dl]C[is d8 hasty?  white tenuki alot! (thats what i'm thinking)


karmaGfa :

D16 is not a big menace on C17, so white can tenuki.

D8 is really nasty. White start a big dead fight.];B[bl]C[i was scared he had some devious plan so i defended!


karmaGfa :

If you want to win, to defend can be usefull too :-)

I think you have done well. D8 is now away from the other stones.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ce];B[gd]C[not sure if this is ok but i wanted inflence so i hope it is


karmaGfa :

not bad at all.];W[oc]C[

karmaGfa :

This move is generally not good. If I was black, I will play P16 to cover it on the border.

karmaGfa :

keep in mind that making territory in the center is hard. Also, the bigger you try to make it, the less you have chance to be successfull.]

karmaGfa :

good choice.];B[ob]C[

karmaGfa :

S14 was better.];W[nb];B[pa];W[md];B[le];W[rf];B[oh];W[pj]C[now i want to split this group up

karmaGfa :

there is not a big interest in splitting it again. you should protect in P9, so "if" he live, he will live little.

Now, if you split it, he will live with a lot of points.];B[oi]
