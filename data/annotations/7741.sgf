A seems better. The purpose is to wall in white. The marked stones are dead.]

If W plays B I can play C or vice versa.

Actually, taking another look, I think that connecting a B might be the safest for me.  Finding space for two eyes looks a little iffy if W cuts at B.]

At the end of this game, I felt like sloppy attacking was what had done me in.  Several times, I thought I was in a strong position, but got little to no benefit from what looked to be a nice situation for me.

You played well in the beginning. But after you lost some golden opportunities. On the contrary W seized all the opportunities.]
