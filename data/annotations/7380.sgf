AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi my name is Mike, and I'll be reviewing primarily for white, although I'll point out ideas for both sides, as go cannot be won by simply thinking about your own moves. I'm 4k on KGS and I play under the name TakokaT.

As per your request, I will try and analyze the upper left, and the middle of the board. You should note that your losses in the upper left were not so big, where as allowing black to have a strong center was the main reason the game was so close. Some general ideas to keep in mind of stopping your opponent from gaining the center are to always keep a path into the center, and don't let yourself get confined to the side.]

;B[tt]C[Very close game, and well played by both players. One that will definitely help you in your games is doing life and death problems, as you will kill more groups, and be able to read variations faster and more accurately. This would help you find the right move in the upper left (C17 instead of D17), and also help you attack groups more efficiently (like killing the lower right group earlier in the game)

As for b getting a large center territory, You are not allowed to have ALL of the territory in go, as you can verify by watching pro games :), everything is a trade off. However to keep your opponent from gaining too much territory over you, try not to get confined to the sides, as i pointed out in the review. try to always have a path into the center to destroy your opponents potential territory.

I hope this review has been helpful, and good luck improving your game.
