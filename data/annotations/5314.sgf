GC[In this game I played the hardest I had ever had to. I tryed to follow some basic
 thinking and balance tips I had gotten mostly from looking at some of
shygost's lectures from KGS. I tried not to get over-focused on any one part of
the board, except of coarse when something was urgent. Even though I was
very nervous in some parts of this game, overall I did not make any panick
 moves(maybe one), and I felt that almost all my choices were balanced.
My only regret is that I believe alexven was a guest, so I wasn't able to
compliment him on the game. T_T]

C[cliftut(me) vs. alexven(I believe he was a guest)
Played: evening, August 11, 2006
I played white.
This game was my best game so far. Alexven forced me to play as hard as I could to survive.

Reviewer-Marco van Straaten

Hi there, 

my name is Marco and I will review your game for White.];B[pd]
;W[qp];B[dc];W[dq]C[Now that Iook at it, the relation between D17 and D3.
_________________________];B[op];W[kp]C[I knew that this wasn't quite a pinch, but it put a slight squeeze on black, and I thought that if I had played the star point I would have left too much room.  Did I leave the corner too open?
______________________

K4 is still a pincer i guess, because even when Black extends M4, he would be a bit cramped. If you would have played on the star point J6, Black would have been able to make the ideal 2-space extension to L4. With regards to the corner, yeah, that is a bit open, but you get some profit on the lower left side for it.]
;B[pn];W[qn]C[I liked this move; not too slow, not too unprotected.
_______________________];B[pk];W[dj]C[I knew that this move was the biggest. It gave me a base to threaten D17 with. If black had gotten it, it would have been the same for me. K16 was more uncomfortable.
_________________________
yeah, this is a big move indeed.];B[mq];W[lq]C[I also considered L3, but found this one harder for black to get past.
________________________];B[lr];W[kr];B[lp]C[My last move gave me a nice wall that black could not get around without work. D3 made this one seem good. Without it, I would probably have chosen otherwise.
__________________________];W[kq];B[mr];W[lo]TR[de][jc][ph]
C[Did this jump into the center too soon?
_____________________________

Yeah, this move is kinda small, compared with moves like D15, J17, P12.]
;B[ko]C[I thought about K5, but it seemed too risky. Look at my variation and tell me if it is right.
___________________

The variation looks ok, although again there are much bigger moves (see previous comment).]

(;W[mp]C[I wonder slightly if I should have acted differently against L5. I felt that this put some strain on his position.
__________________________];B[mo];W[ln]C[I finished the cut.
________________________

Excellent move.];B[np];W[lp];B[mn];W[jo]C[Ladder!^_^
_________________________];B[kn];W[km];B[qm];W[rm]C[I began to creep along the edge... something I seem to do a lot...
_________________________

This move is risky. See variation.]
(;B[ql];W[rl];B[ro];W[qo];B[rp]C[I did some reading here, and found that I still had a good chance.
_________________________

Yeah, you have more liberties so you're fine.];W[qq];B[rq];W[qr]
;B[rr];W[rs];B[rn];W[qk]C[This was not a good choice.... S9 would have been better for me. Black would take a few moves to stop me.]
;B[rk];W[qj];B[rj];W[ok];B[pj];W[qi];B[pi];W[rh]C[I knew that my S8 group was dead, so I had to extend far enough along the side to survive.
________________________];B[qh];W[ri]C[Black forced me to play here, which in turn forced him to atari my group.
________________________];B[sl];W[po]C[Threatening to cut the group...
________________________];B[oo];W[on]C[Then foring black to connect....
_________________________];B[pm];W[nm]C[I should have played P7, then O7 or O8 would be ok.
________________________];B[om];W[nn];B[mm];W[nl];B[ml];W[ol]
;B[pl];W[oj];B[oi];W[nj];B[ni];W[mj];B[lk]C[My position is getting cramped.
________________________];W[lj];B[kk];W[ll]C[Things got more complex from here on.
_________________________];B[lm];W[mk];B[kl];W[jn];B[jm];W[kn]
;B[ki];W[kj];B[jj];W[jk];B[jl];W[li]C[I saw an opportunity for double-atari. I saw that if black took K9, I would have a greater chance to save my escaping group.
_______________________

Yeah, the threat of the double atari, enables you to run away.]
;B[ji]C[Black decides to connect rather than capture.
______________________];W[lh];B[lf]C[Black tries to block me off...
___________________];W[mg]C[So I make a diagonal that will gives me th most options and liberties.
_______________________

K13 might be better, you have a some more space there.];B[lg]
;W[qg]C[I threaten to protect the cut.
_______________________];B[ph];W[pg]C[I begin boxing black in.
_______________________];B[og]C[I made a variation because I think that my next move could be better.
_______________________

Other variation is no good, Black can taked on S7 when he wants and then his P12 group is alive.]

(;W[of];B[ng];W[mh];B[nf];W[mf]C[Keeping black contained...
_______________________];B[me];W[nh];B[kh]C[black protcts against my cut.
_________________________];W[oh]C[I have a double-atari. Black is forced to save his big group and lose three stones.
______________________];B[sm];W[ne]TR[jc][de]C[I get my second eye and my group lives! This gave me power to influence th corner.
_______________________

Yes indeed, it gives you a nice foothold in the center.
Again, this is a good moment to sit back, look at the board and find out where the biggest moves are.
Apart from playing the corner the triangled point are big ones too.]
;B[pf]
(;W[qf]C[I make a forcing move and gain sente.
______________________

Here I preferred P15, it splits up Black immediately, and also with sente. You move isn't wrong though.]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[qd];W[rd];B[rg]C[It took me a moment to read for this move. but I saw that I could defend and kill the group.]
;W[sg]C[I think I remember something I didn't like about playing S14. I'm not sure though; I think I misread it.
______________________];B[rf];W[sf];B[si]C[black almost tricked me here! I had the urge to play T12 but discarded that quickly. I almost forgot the atari I had just gotten.
__________________

Excellent, was just a cheap trick play, but you didn't fall for it :)]
;W[re];B[nd];W[od]C[I decided to try and get a few points from black, and theaten a double-atari again.
________________________];B[oe]C[I wasn't expecting this. Now that I look at it, Q17 is an interesting variant.
_____________________

I give Black an ugly, concentrated shape, but he would be alive easily.]

(;W[nf];B[oc]C[I decided that I was happy up here for now, so I looked over the board.
_____________________];W[ik]TR[de][ic]C[I decided to escape here.
_____________________

I dont think this move is that big, it's just 1 stone, D15 would have been nice or I17 or so.]
;B[hm];W[im];B[il]C[I got tricked by the atari and didn't realize that a move at O5 would give me at least 10 points. Something really big that I missed.
_____________________]
(;W[in]C[I connected, not wanting to give black too much influence in my area. The ten points I could have gained by playing at O5 would have been worth losing the piece, but I didn't see it.
______________________];B[hk];W[gl]C[this move had several puposes; threaten to cut black into three pieces; to threaten an atari; and to give me some much- needed protection against black's approach toward the left.
(I don't think I realized all of these benefits when I played this.)
______________________

Yes, the most important reason is the lower left.];B[hn]C[Black didn't protect...
_____________________];W[ho]C[...and I fouled it up. For some reason, I didn't make the cut; and I don't even remember why! I could have cut here and it would have been good...
_____________________];B[fn]C[Here, I would have lost more if I had cut, but I still didn't see the cut.
______________________];W[fo]C[I think I should have played at G6.
_______________________

Here again the cut would have been big, it would have left Black with a very weak group in the lower left.]
;B[go];W[gp];B[gn];W[hl]C[I finally used the cut but blacks H7 group weakened th effect.
_____________________];B[ij]C[Now my two stones were weak, and had far less influence.
_____________________];W[fm];B[en];W[dn]C[I would not have considered this move very good(as in several of my early games it got me killed), but my stones above and below made it seem better.
______________________

E5 is probably better, now you leave too many cutting points in your position.]
;B[fp]C[Black cut me in two. I would like to know if F3 is a good idea? Right about here the game began getting intense.
_____________________]
(;W[eo];B[hp]C[I got hit with a double-atari!
___________________];W[ip]C[I think this was pretty good. black was forced to choose one...
_____________________];B[gq]C[Black chooses to strengthen his earlier cut.
_____________________];W[io]C[If I had played at H3, I could have forced black to connect and then moved here...
____________________

You can still force Black to connect after E7 and G7.];B[iq]
;W[jq]C[My group has two eyes.
____________________];B[ep];W[do];B[dp];W[cp]C[I don't think there was any better move, but I could be wrong.
_____________________

Looks fine to me.];B[cq];W[bq];B[co];W[bp];B[cn];W[dm];B[cr]
;W[ir]C[I was thinking: 'If I can only keep him from getting two eyes, I can get it all.'
_____________________

Black will probably get 2 eyes after E3, I think you should have played D2 here.]
;B[hq];W[hr]C[So I tried to reduce black's eye space.
___________________];B[gr];W[dr]C[I did a lot of reading before this move...
_____________________];B[ds];W[br]C[...and it payed off.
____________________];B[em]C[black begins an escape up top.
____________________];W[el]C[I read a bit before this too. I found that the ladder threat at D8 was false.
____________________];B[dl];W[cm];B[bm];W[cl]C[The stone at B8 was the ladder breaker.
______________________];B[dk];W[ck]C[This kept black from the side and killed black's stones on the left.
______________________];B[ek];W[ej]C[I decided that since trying to save all of my stones would not work, I might as well strengthen back's resolve...
____________________];B[fl];W[fk]C[I put black's three stones in atari without realizing it; my actual objective was to force black to connect his one stone or to capture F7.
____________________];B[gm]C[If I had seen it, I would have taken it out right here, and had a solid bse to extend upward... but it turned out that me not capturing helped me in the end...(mysterious, right?^_^)
____________________

Well, if you capture, then F7 becomes a false, now Black can connect and create at least one eye at F7, not too sure whether he can get another eye though.]
;W[fj]C[I protected against a bad cut.
_____________________];B[el]C[Black took advantage of his chance to save three pieces.
_____________________];W[gk]C[I liked this trade off. He got to keep three stones and I got to save two. If he had chosen to take my two pieces, I would have taken his three. "Peace is its own reward"
__________________];B[cj]C[A possibly dangerous cut...
____________________

I don't think it's that dangerous.];W[bn]C[I took a precaution to make sure I lived.
_____________________];B[bl];W[bk]C[Black's two stones died.
_____________________];B[ak];W[bj]C[Another ladder-breaker.
______________________];B[ci];W[am]TR[ce][de]C[This move really didn't do anything for me. I should have moved elsewhere.
_________________

Yes, a better move would be breaking the connection between D17 and C11.]
;B[gj];W[gi]C[This threat slightly reduced my groups precarious position.
_____________________];B[hj];W[di]TR[eh][fh]C[I was very happy about this move. It kept black's C11 group at bay and protected against a cut at F11.
______________________

A move at E12 at F12 would have been a bit less slow.];B[ch]
;W[dh]C[Here I almost knew I could live.
______________________

Yes, you're fine here.];B[dg];W[eq]C[I decided a threat was in order.
_____________________

Yes, note if Black played there (even earlier in the game),
his groups would probably be alive.];B[fq]C[black made a threat in return.
____________________];W[cs]LB[gn:A][gq:B]C[I captured and black had no chance to make eyes. Now I was sure that I could kill groups A and B if I only kept my F10 group alive.
__________________];B[eh];W[fh]C[This was to keep black from killing at F11.
______________________

This move does not work,
Black has a snapback combination, see variation.
Playing at F11 yourself seems best, although your group is still a bit in danger.]

(;B[fg];W[gg];B[hh];W[gh]C[I had to respond.
____________________];B[gf];W[hg]C[I knew that this open ladder(or 'broken ladder'? Not sure what the actual term is) would eventually give me a double atari if black continued it.
____________________];B[ig];W[hf];B[he];W[ff];B[ge];W[eg];B[ef]
;W[ei];B[fe];W[fg]C[Two eyes! Now it was only a matter of reducing black and trying to slip through.
____________________];B[df];W[if];B[ie];W[jf];B[je];W[ih];B[jg]
;W[kg]C[hehe.... ^_^*   My most pointless move the entire game!]
;B[kf];W[hi];B[no];W[qc]C[I decided to finish this corner.
____________________];B[pc];W[pb]C[I got too greedy. T_T
_____________________];B[qb]C[I got punished for it, too. I would have gotten the corner.
_____________________];W[rc];B[rb];W[sb];B[ob];W[le]C[A threat...
____________________];B[md];W[jh]C[and another...
____________________];B[kg];W[kd]C[and then an attempt to cut black off and gain some liberties.
_____________________

Black could just play at K15 and be safe.];B[ld];W[gs]C[I decided that since a black move at L15 would let black go, I would turn up heat elsewhere to gain sente eventually.
_____________________];B[fs];W[hs];B[er]C[two false eyes to hold me off.
_____________________];W[es];B[bi];W[al];B[ds];W[ii];B[js];W[jr]
;B[kc]C[Black took away my options there.
_____________________];W[or]TR[ll][ke]LB[mo:A]C[This was the move I thought was most crucial in my attempt to capture group A.

After Black connects L8 and K15 this group is alive.];B[pq]

;B[nq];W[es];B[ps];W[pp];B[ns];W[jk];B[qs]C[A mistake for black; I think he was trying to double-atari and kill me. This one was slightly painful for me, as I'm generally a friendly player, but with all of black's territory on the top, I couldn't risk letting it go.

Great game!

W-cliftut: 160.5
B-alexven: 86

White wins by 74.5

Although I won this game, it was very close up to the point that I was was able to capture my first large group, and it really made me play hard. I would love to play a rematch, but since alexven was a guest, I can't unless he logs in again with the same username.
______________________

One last point of advice:
Try to be more alert of playing on the big points instead of just capture stones and trying to kill groups.
