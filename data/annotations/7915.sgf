C[Hi, I'm Dam63 and i'm playing Black in this game.

Thank you for your review, i think i'm playing too much territorial but i don't really see when i have to defend or make territory and when i have to push, invade, reduce.

Can you help to highlight biggest mistakes ?

I made some comment by myself in the game feel free to correct me.

[Calvin\]: Hi.  Remember that I am also a kyu player and much of what I say might be wrong, especially in the details.

There is nothing wrong with being territorial, but I think you are defending small things and allowing your opponent to push you around.  There are also some costly misreads in the game and places where you are playing a lot of aji keshi.   (See http://senseis.xmp.net/?AjiKeshi).  I have more comments inline and at the end of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[jj]
(;B[dd]C[D : Is this a good answer to take the third corner or is it better to take R5 or Q10 ?

[Calvin\]: It's fine to take the empty  corner.  White 2 at tengen is an unusual move, and white needs to do something special to make use of it.  But see variations for some ideas about what white may be thinking.]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[jd];B[qo];W[qj]
(;B[jp]SQ[jd][qj]C[[Calvin\]: Although this is a big extension, I think I would play Q13 first.  The concern here is that white has taken both of the big extensions from black's Q16 star point, which restricts black's development and makes a 3-3 invasion at R17 interesting for white.  See variation.]
;W[gq]
(;B[dj]C[D: Here, better try to fortify the Q16 stone before thinking about elsewhere ?

[Calvin\]: I would play in the upper right now, but I can see how you might think white will make a box shape.   See variation.]
;W[ci]C[[Calvin\]: This move just helps black get stronger.]
;B[cj];W[di]
(;B[cn]TR[cj][dj]SQ[ci][di]C[[Calvin\]: I understand the temptation for black to get a base right away, but the hane at the head of two stones at E11 is bigger now.  In general, the marked shape is unstable.  Either side can gain a big advantage locally by playing there first, so it is rare to see a shape like this left alone.]
;W[cl]
(;B[bl]C[D : Which side should i take here ? White has big center influence, is it better to take from D8 ?

[Calvin\]: When black has D10, usually D8 is the shape, but see variation.]
;W[bk];B[bm];W[bj];B[bp];W[ej];B[cq]C[D: Seems to be an important move but afterwards i should have played around top right corner ?]
;W[dq];B[en]SQ[dp][dq][gq]C[D: Here, i would like to escape to center, i don't want to leave all the center to white ! But i don't know how

[Calvin\]: This isn't too bad.  It puts pressure on white's marked stones and also gets black out.]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[em];B[fn];W[cr];B[br];W[cs]
(;B[bs]C[D: End game move ?

[Calvin\]: Yes, it is also aji keshi, helping white to fix shape.  See variation.]
;W[er]C[[Calvin\]: Now white is clearly alive here.];B[qf];W[mc]
(;B[pb]LB[oc:A]C[D: Here, taking corner is good ? It's gote and white can corner me

[Calvin\]: It's a good defense here.  (Although P17 is maybe a little better.) Remember that white if black does not defend, white can get a ko by playing at the 3-3 point, R17.  See variation.]
;W[oc]C[[Calvin\]: This move is aji keshi for white.  (It makes black stronger and removes possibilities.)]
;B[pc]C[[Calvin\]: Now white can no longer play moves like R17 or R15 effectively.]
;W[mp]

[Calvin\]: If you don't like this result for black, then yes. :-)]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[nr]
(;B[mr]C[[Calvin\]: It's a bad shape.  See variation.];W[ns]
C[[Calvin\]: White doesn't need to defend.];B[ps]C[[Calvin\]: Black should save this atari and tenuki. White can't make an eye on the side here anyway.]
;W[kq];B[or];W[op];B[ms];W[ip]
(;B[jq]C[D: Why going to the bottom, shouldn't go to the center here?

[Calvin\]: See variation.];W[kr]
(;B[jr]C[[Calvin\]: Black is trying to link up, but maybe should be thinking about separating white instead.  How about L4?  (See variation.)]
;W[kp]
(;B[ks]C[[Calvin\]: This doesn't connect black.  White can play M1 and capture either one stone or 5 stones.]
;W[jo]C[D : Here we go ! Here i think the game is already over but tell me if i'm mistaken

[Calvin\]: I like white here because black's position is low on the lower left and  lower right and white's central power seems to dominate.]
(;B[ic]LB[bd:A][cd:B]C[[Calvin\]: This just helps white.  The territorial moves here are A or B, but I think black needs to be more active.  White's R10 stone Doesn't quite have enough space to make a two-point extension on both sides.  See variation.]
;W[id];B[jc];W[kc]TR[ci][di][ej][id][jd][jj]C[D: Still too much territorial moves, yes i got some points but with K10 stone i let him build a magnificient influence :(

[Calvin\]: Look at this.  White got two hanes at the head of two stones, and they work great with white's K10 stone, which was originally a weird move in the opening.  Now it's perfect.]
(;B[ql]C[[Calvin\]: Black can't tenuki from the upper side.  Black must continue with H16 or H17.]
(;W[qn]C[[Calvin\]: White should play H17 instead.  See variation.]
;B[rn]C[D: Why am i afraid ? Q6 isn't better ?

[Calvin\]: Yes, this looks passive.];W[pn];B[qm];W[ro];B[rm]
;W[pm];B[pk];W[oj];B[pj];W[pi]C[[Calvin\]: Do you see the marked shape with white L17?  That is why J17 is bad.  Because black played elsewhere on the left, white got to make a hane at the head near E10, too.  The marked shapes are not only working together for white, but they also have a good relationship with white's K10 move, which looked strange in the opening but now is in a great spot.]
;B[rj]MA[oi][qi]C[[Calvin\]: The shape at the top is not finished. Even though black S10 threatens to capture a white stone, a white hane at H17 would be unbearable for black.  Also, locally, S10 is not the correct shape.  White P10 was bad, because it creates this shape that looks like white didn't connect a peep.  When black pushes through at Q10, the normal follow-up is to cut at either P11 or R11.]
(;W[qi]C[[Calvin\]: Black doesn't gain from exchanging S10 for R11.  Of course, if I were white, I would have ignored S10 and played H17 immediately.  See variation.]
;B[ri];W[qk];B[pl];W[rk];B[qh];W[ph];B[qg];W[sj];B[si]C[D: Lol, close your eyes please :D, it's 25kyu tsumego problem :(

[Calvin\]: It happens to everyone.];W[rh];B[sk];W[sh];B[rg]
C[[Calvin\]: Black should save this as a ko threat. There is no need to force white to capture now.]
;W[sj];B[sl]SQ[hd]C[[Calvin\]: It's very small to save this stone.  Black H16 is urgent.  Black is perhaps to psychologically obsessed with his previous mistake in this area.]
;W[ok];B[ol]C[D: Got cornered again ! where could i have gone to the center ?

[Calvin\]: This is a fairly big move.  Both players have been ignoring the H17/H17 area.]
;W[nl];B[om];W[on];B[nm];W[mm]
(;B[nn]C[[Calvin\]: See variation.];W[mn];B[nf]C[D: First move of the game toward center, not too bad i think, but it's really too late

Reviewing some of the bigger mistakes for black:

Move 17: Missing hane at the head of two stones.
Move 35: Small move, aji Keshi
Move 43: Touching weak stone, helps white.
Move 51: Misread, allowing black to be separated.
Move 69: Misread?  Lets white connect on outside and separates black.
Move 71: Bad contact helps white.
Move 75: Bad tenuki.  (Leaving urgent area, hane at head of two stones.)
Move 87: Move helps white.
Move 97: Large misread.
Move 101: Bad sente. Wastes ko threat.
Move 103: Too small.
Move 115: Unnecessary defense.
Move 121: Failure to protect cut.
Move 133: Wasted ko threat.
Move 147: Failure to protect cut.

And right up until the end of the game, white could have played M1.  For most of the endgame, it's by far the largest move on the board.  Both players overlooked this, maybe assuming black's stones were connected.  They're not. :-)

Some of these moves you already know are mistakes, like when your opponent gets an unreasonably good result or plays something you didn't see was possible.  Misreads can be reduced by studying life&death and tesuji problems to improve reading.

Other mistakes are harder to see, because the punishment is not obviously dramatic or immediate.  So aji keshi is something to be avoid.  Avoid playing "bad sente" moves---i.e., forcing moves which accomplish nothing but waste ko threats or force the opponent to defend in an obvious place that you might want to exploit later.  These moves are sometimes hard to find in our own games, because we don't see the wasted potential.  But wasted potential should be counted as a loss.  You'll appreciate this more as you get into more games with game-deciding ko fights and find yourself short on threats.

The "hane at the end of two stones" is really powerful.   Learn to appreciate it.   http://senseis.xmp.net/?HaneAtTheHeadOfTwoStones

Territorial positions should be on the 3rd line in general.  The 2nd line is the line of defeat.  If you look at the endgame postition, you can see a lot of stones black stones on the 1st and 2nd lines, so your territories are small.]
