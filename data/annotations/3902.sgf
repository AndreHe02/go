RE[W+R]

C[Dear Reviewer,
I am playing Black in this game, and lost by a big margin.
I guess my strategy is mistaken, although I am sure I made also some tactical mistakes.
Please help me to understand where I went wrong.
Thanks!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[pj]C[I like san-ren-sei...]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me]C[I guess up till now is joseki]
;W[nq]C[White would like to secure the corner on the other side as well, and then reduce Black's moyo from the center. I decided to press more and keep the corner.

openmind: There is nothing wrong with allowing white to take the corner in exhange for influence.]
;B[np]C[openmind: This is also playable];W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq]
;W[lq];B[pn]C[I guess this is joseki as well.];W[ln]C[openmind: White's move at m6 dosen't threathen blacks position in anyway. Even if white later plays either m8 or n7 black would still be safe to play elsewhere.]

(;B[mm]C[openmind: This is the first major mistake by black.
As mentioned earlier this move should be played elsewhere. For example at d6. 
Black is probably thinking of the right side as his territory, but that is wrong !!!!. You will want to use your influence to fight and make territory elsewhere while chasing the white stones.]
;W[rc];B[rd]C[openmind: Again black should play elsewhere];W[sd]
;B[se];W[sc];B[rf];W[mi];B[oh]C[If black should answer this then it should be around L11 to start a fight. Maybe starting with M7 to seperate white's stones.]
;W[lm];B[ml];W[ng];B[nh]C[This is the first point where I have some doubts.
P13 seems more solid?

openmind: Actually this is a very good move !!! You are already strong here and should take any opportunity to start a fight.]
;W[mf];B[mh]C[opnemind: Good];W[ne];B[nd];W[le];B[md];W[lg]
;B[lh];W[pf];B[of];W[og]
(;B[oe]C[openmind: This should be at Q13 (see variation)];W[ph]
;B[nf];W[mg];B[qg];W[pg];B[qj]C[Although White has an eyeless group (m13) and a lonely stone (n11), I am not sure Black should be satisfied here. White has sente, he managed to reduce Black's moyo a lot, he has the upper right corner, and the left side is more promising for White.
What do you say?

openmind: I think you are right. The main reason is that black has played to passive.]
;W[kh];B[li];W[ki];B[kj];W[oi];B[ni];W[pi];B[nj];W[ih];B[jd]
;W[jj];B[kk]C[openmind: Because of the cut at L13 black can play the hane at K9 here.]
;W[jk];B[kl];W[in]C[This is a good play by White, threatening to build a huge moyo on the bottom. Here I thought for while - should I invade the bottom, or approach from c6? I decided to approach, since invading would be an easy target for White and he could seal me in, building srtong influence towards the center. But I may be wrong...

openmind: c6 seems like the right direction];B[cn];W[fp];B[ck]
C[openmind: Why not B4 ?];W[co];B[ch];W[ec];B[dn]C[Is this the right move? Should I have descended to b6 - but then Black would take the key point of d6...?

openmind: This is good move that makes black stronger at reduces white's potential in the center]
;W[bo]C[This is painful for Black because the corner is now all White.

openmind: Right now white is about 20-30 points ahead. The only way black can upset this lead is by invading the lower side. Allthough it looks very difficult.]
;B[gc];W[di];B[ci];W[dj];B[dk]C[This may be a mistake? In the following sequence, White destroys Black's potential territory and forces him to struggle for life, while building some potential for himself...

openmind: this move is fine];W[cj];B[bj];W[bl]C[openmind: Black should connect at B9 (see variation)]

;B[go];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[hn]C[The end result is very bad. Invading the bottom is very difficult, if not impossible - and this territory is twice as big as Black's moyo on the right side!

In fact, I think Black is lost at this point.

What was the mistake?

Please do not hesitate to provide all comments, also on next moves.]

;B[je];W[gd]C[openmind: White gives black a last changes to turn the game be allowing black to cut at L13. It does seem however white has a reasonable chance to secure both the M13 and the L12 groups. Black has to try it anyway though.]

;W[fr];B[gp];W[fq]C[I do not see how Black can live here. The best is taking the KO fight (see next moves on the left), but even then White takes the advantage to win the bottom right corner...

openmind: As far as i can see black can get a ko (see variations)]
