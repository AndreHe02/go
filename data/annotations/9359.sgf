C[René: Hi there. You are a good player, IMO more a 5-6k than a 8k. You play a relatively clean, passive style. That can bring you far, but if you want to be better than 1d one day you'd try to play more aggressively. Remember: When your position has no weaknesses, it means you are playing inefficiently! Try to memorize 200 (random) pro games till moves 100-120 and I can see you playing around 1d in 6 months. (But do not feel pressured, let the joy of the game always be superior, because at the end of the day it doesn't mean a big thing if you are 8k or 5k or 1d or 3d...still way too weak in terms of the real strong players.)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[cf];W[co]C[Is it ok to tennuki here ? Is the shimari bigger ? Or is it an open question at this point ?

René: Yes, it's ok to tenuki here. Actually it's important to learn to tenuki more often in fuseki. You will see that it will give you plenty of opportunities to choose from. So do not be afraid from tenuki. In this case I even think the shimari is indeed bigger that answering c14.]
;B[cj];W[fc];B[ef];W[qn];B[dm];W[qf];B[pj]C[As I see it the double pincer is effective for black, and I see no good continuation

René: It's not a problem, if you learn to stay calm. Actually what you did what not too bad, but it'd be better to double attack here, see var. By the way: You could also tenuki here, playing e.g. at k3 or even b16 (big move even in early stages of the game even if it does look small). If black is greedy and wants those two stones, he has to put a lot of stones and effort in it while you just lose two stones.]

(;W[rp];B[mq];W[qq];B[mc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qh]C[So I decided to make life at both ends.

René: As I mentioned, the result is OK for you. You are overconcentrated, but black's stone at q10 seems odd now and his n3/q4-stones need immediate help to get not under attack. Don't be afraid to get into not-so-good-shapes sometimes. It's only weird if it doesn't work^^.]

;W[qg];B[rc];W[nf];B[re]C[René: Nice sequence from you. You reduced black and still managed to get out safe.]
;W[rg];B[ri];W[ql]C[I tried to steal the base of black so my group ahead do not suffer a too severe attack

René: Another good move, because it threatens black, though another overconcentrated move. It shows by example that sometimes those moves are OK.]

[lj][pj][ol][pl][pm][qm]SQ[pp][mq][pq][pr]C[René: This move is too passive. You gotta play at L3. Then you have two weak black groups under attack and while black is trying to live with either one you can probably make territory around h3 (or kill something). Also: A move at L3 was due like 15-20 moves earlier, it was a huge move you didn't take advantage of.]
;B[jq];W[bm];B[cl]
(;W[bk]C[René: Too small. The upper black group is still not settled. Try to attack like in the var. One cannot overestimate the benefit of attacking a weak group. Even if you will have plenty of examples where you fail to do it effectively, later, you will benefit. If you make a habit out of playing passively you'll have a hard time later, because this style usually doesn't bring you over the 1d-barrier.]

René: Yes, play g5 and kill. But you're decision was correct gamewise, because at this point you were leading and one should't take any risks in that case (the center is basically neutral at this point). End of review.]
