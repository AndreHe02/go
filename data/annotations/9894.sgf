C[Hi, this game is a rather typical game of mine. I don't think I can handle it well, if my opponent plays for influence.

CC: black was ahead for most of the game but you had a shot to turn the tables there in the end.
interesting game hope comments help

71-106 black let you get back in the game when he chases you through his entire moyo. good job catching up in this section. you were way behind... after 106 you are only a little behind.

132 was a huge deal. you needed to go 33 at that point. :)]

;W[nl]LB[oj:B][nm:A]TR[qj]C[Better at A or B -- your move looks a bit wishywashy. doesn't leave you with a good follow up againsts black r10.]
;B[ko]LB[lo:A]C[this has a big weakness at A. as white i would just cut right away]

(;W[jq]C[I thought this was necessary to make my group safe, but black used that to make a huge wall...]
;B[jp];W[iq];B[kq];W[kr];B[ip]
(;W[hq]LB[qj:D][nl:A][ko:C][hq:B]C[CC: too submissive. hane up to disconnect black groups and put more pressure.

I'm going to focus here for a second... because i think this is where things start to go wrong for you.

The feeling like you are behind without making a mistake happens a lot in go... and it is often because of moves like A and B.  try to push your stones a bit more... 

lets look at A first... A doesn't really strongly attack the C group as you can see in the variation... and it aslso doesn't really pressure the D stone... so it is only serving one purpose.. to get your group out. it is often a good idea to try to do two things at once... if you need to get your group out... do it while pressuring a black group.

now C -- similarly... it doesn't put much pressure on the C group... no harsh follow up... black could tenuki no problem. this move serves to prevent the hane at the head of two stones. but you could prevent the hane AND hane at the head of his stones. :)  two purposes...

its important to think this way as you get better. try to do the most with your moves.]
;B[hp];W[gq]C[Should white have played away during this sequence? But I thought I should avoid hane at the head of 2 or 3 stones.]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[fo];W[fq];B[eo]
(;W[cg]C[Now I think this was a mistake.  I tried to reduce the influence of that giant wall, but maybe I should've focused on my weak group first. Maybe by playing P 10?

CC: tough i'm not sure. maybe an exchange on the right first? its tough because black wall at bottom was allowed to get so strong..]
;B[nj]C[CC: this is a very good move for black! tough to deal with]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[ll]LB[rk:A]C[CC: this feels too passive... you can always live with A.. so your group isn't that bad...]
;B[lj];W[mo]C[CC: bad move. this area is still a bit weak for black... but this move helps him solidify the connection]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[mm];W[ml];B[lo]
(;W[jl]C[I wasn't sure if white was supposed to make a base at the lower right side, or jump out like I did in the game.

CC: tough call.  i would have just played on the top side -- it is very big and your group isn't that unhealthy yet. K8 seems a bit slow to me :/]
;B[jd];W[pj];B[pk]C[black should play other side to maintain his moyo!]
