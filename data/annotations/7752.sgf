;B[pq];W[ce];B[dp];W[qd];B[qo]C[C15 is an odd opening.  I probably would've taken advantage of it by playing at either D17 or E16.  As you see later, leaving it be gives him a pretty large corner.]
;W[ed];B[oc];W[qh];B[lc]C[Good fuseki.  A more aggressive alternative would be R14.]
;W[jc];B[jq];W[dj];B[cm];W[qk];B[hc]C[
Were better moves available here?

At this point, not really.  This move kinda makes up for losing the big corner, but the sides are mostly developed so something like this would work.  I maybe would play higher, like H16, to keep the pressure but gain some influence rather than living small.]
;W[hd];B[fc];W[ec];B[jb]C[

I'm now just looking for a way to make life, and hopefully fight out to the centre.   But I have no idea how to do so!

This is pretty much it.  The pincer you used works, but is hard.  Pincers are typically meant to either sacrifice one of the stones and allow for the other side to sneak in, or for both stones to escape.  Connecting is troublesome, as you can see here.  It works, but in this case at the cost of living relatively small.]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[gc];B[hb];W[fb];B[gd];W[fd];B[id];W[jd];B[he]
C[Good continuation though, putting my comments to shame ^^]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[ke];B[if];W[je];B[hf];W[jg];B[fg]C[
And out into what will hopefully become a useful area.
White appears to have got the better of me in this attempted invasion.  But I still hold the bottom 2 corners and should be able to live at the top.

Well, if you're careful, the K15 white group is in trouble.  This works out evenly imo if you extend your two stones in the upper right into the center to prevent white from creating a moyo.]
;W[md]C[
White isn't giving up the attack though];B[mc];W[od]C[nvm];B[cj]
TR[fg]C[
Now to see if the marked stone can be put to work.];W[ci];B[bj]
;W[nc]C[
If white lets me!  He must be really worried about that corner

I don't think white is worried about the corner here.  Mostly just trying sente moves.  I think you both are looking to small.  Fighting is meant for the middle game, and this is the latter part of the opening still.  Extend to the center, gain some influence to set up an attack, then start worrying about life and death.  There are more points to nab.]
;B[nb];W[nd];B[pc];W[kc];B[lb];W[qb];B[di];W[dh];B[ei];W[pb]
C[
After a little thought I ignore this tenuki to continue my attack on the left

That's good, since you're getting more points that way.  White got maybe 7 points, you have the potential for much more by blocking whites entrances into the bottom portion of the board.]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[bh];W[dg];B[ej]C[I would play the ladder instead here, mostly because D10 could be a nusicance this way.  I could be missing something you saw though...]
;W[ob];B[ae]C[
And again. those stones are dead so leave them and keep attacking

Is there a better invasion here?  To get into that corner?  No.  White is pretty thick.
Should I have secured some more territory with a small extension on the right?  Or pushed into the centre?
The small extension on the right would get you maybe two-four points (i'm assuming you mean R7).  Definitely extend to the center.  J10 or tengen would do well to connect your two groups there, as well as beginning to build a moyo in that whole corner, with the only real weakness at G3.  White wouldn't have support to invade.]
;W[bd];B[ad]C[This invasion was very good option though, but you could've gotten more in the center.  If white leaves it open after you've exhausted parts of the center, or you have a good tenuki, THEN invade.]
;W[bc];B[qm]C[
Now I make the extension causing a battle to the centre

Better to start ahead in the chase, rather than waiting for white to start.]
;W[ok];B[om];W[ml];B[ij]C[
A long pause before I make a strangely placed move that appears not to create territory, nor attack!

It does in fact create territory, although this is at a slightly less opportune moment than earlier because now W68 can suppor an invasion to puncture your moyo.  This does create territory with support from a move at J13, and as I said begins to create a monster moyo that white would have to make an unsupported invasion.]
;W[ki];B[jl]C[
This move feels weak too, although at least it might gain some territory
Well, it does help hedge white coming into your moyo, but that's a bad strategy.]
;W[mn]C[
Now I'll have to defend both corners for a while.

Your corners are alive.  I'd be more worried about whites moyo in the upper right, and making my own moyo to counter (which I think you do)]
;B[no];W[nm];B[on];W[kn];B[jn];W[kl];B[kk];W[lk];B[kj];W[lj]
;B[ji];W[kh];B[jm];W[km];B[lo]C[
Not the best defence...

Sometimes, when a group is invading like this, you gotta give a little more than you'd like, otherwise it'll keep pushing through.  M4 probably would've been stronger.]
;W[ko];B[kp]C[I would've played K5.];W[jo];B[io];W[jp];B[lq]
C[

defend some cutting points but let him continue to crawl into my territory

That's the unfortunate setback of using the double hane as you did.]
;W[ip];B[ho];W[iq];B[gq]C[
Attempt to contain him

This was a much better containing move.];W[jr];B[kq];W[hq];B[gp]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[hr];B[fq];W[kr];B[lr];W[mo];B[mp];W[ln];B[nq]
;W[ih]C[
And then he attacks again

The plus side to losing this battle is that he helped you strengthen your moyo there, but it's bittersweet because that all could've been yours.  And this is also partially the result of you letting white start the race to the middle.  Sente is very important in Go.  Playing too defensive can be costly.]
;B[gj]TR[hf][fg][ei][ij]C[
The marked stones feel connected but somehow they are cut

They are loosely connected.  A double knight's move is pretty loose, especially considering whites stones at D13.]
;W[hi];B[hj];W[gh];B[fh];W[gg];B[fe]C[Keep in mind, a knights move isn't technically connected, and shouldn't be depended on for a vital connection, because white can split it if he/she really wants to, no matter what you do.]
;W[gf];B[ge];W[ff];B[ee];W[de]C[
Now my upper side group needs to be careful to keep its eye space

Yes.];B[gb];W[fc];B[jf];W[kf];B[kb];W[eh];B[fi];W[dk];B[el]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[gi];B[dl];W[eg];B[ck];W[ii];B[fa]C[This move is gote and should be saved until later.  I believe that you can live with that group, without having to play there with the amount of space you have.  However, you're right in that it's better to be safe than sorry in a large group like this, and unless you are sure you've read every possibility, it probably isn't worth the risk.]
;W[ea];B[ga];W[na];B[mb];W[ma];B[la]TR[jb]C[
At least it is alive];W[oa];B[rk]TW[mm][ll][lm]TB[fj][ek][ha]
[ia][ja][ka][dj][dk]C[
Then I take my opportunity to return the attack.
Good call, take the initiative back ^^

What is the score at this point?

My score calculator puts you ahead by 20, which I would agree with.  The way I would work it out midgame is by thinking that you both have relatively equal large territories in the lower left and upper right, and your lower right corner is much larger than white's upper left.]
;W[rj];B[rl];W[ql];B[rm];W[pl];B[pm];W[nn];B[oo];W[lp];B[ol]
;W[nl]C[
White makes a mistake and I can steal a few more points];B[qj]
;W[pk];B[ri];W[qi];B[sj];W[pj];B[rh]C[This whole invasion worked out for you very well.  Great job.  This is what solidified your lead.]
;W[rg];B[sg];W[sf];B[rj]C[
I spot my lack of liberties just in time

I might be missing something, but S14 could get you further in.]
;W[sh];B[si];W[sg];B[qg];W[pg];B[ac]C[
Steal yet more points in the top left

This is a better time to do this, now that things are winding down.  Good sente points.]

;W[in]C[
Now white wants to see if I can defend an invasion.
And so do I];B[hp];W[im];B[hl];W[il];B[jk];W[hm];B[gm];W[gl]
;B[hk];W[gn];B[fm];W[fn];B[hn];W[em];B[ik]C[
A wasted move?  F8 better?

Both work fine.  At this point you need to do something.  Keep in mind that every time white makes a move in your territory, and you don't respond, that's an extra prisoner in the endgame and therefore a point for you.  Of course, be careful, but something to consider.  Passing is a viable option during an invasion.]
;W[eo];B[do];W[dn];B[dm]C[
C6 instead?

I would've.];W[cn];B[en];W[bo];B[fo]C[Don't worry about atari during an invasion, and especially ko this far into the endgame (although this game is an exception, because you have plenty of ko threats).  I'd ply B4 to not give white a chance to go anywhere.]
;W[em];B[ep];W[cq];B[en];W[cp];B[co];W[bn]C[
Is he actually going to make life here!
Is my defending that bad?

Naw, it was a close one though.];B[cr];W[br];B[bs];W[bq];B[ap]
C[Good move, and good read.];W[ao];B[dq];W[aq];B[as]C[I would be more worried about white extending up.]
;W[bm];B[am]C[
No you don't

I think if white played B8, instead of A8, you would've been in trouble.  20/20 hindsight I guess.]
;W[al];B[bl];W[an];B[ak];W[bi];B[ai]C[Nice work though.];W[pe]
;B[ef];W[df]C[
A strange response so I continue the attempt

A easy looking win at the end, but I felt I could lose at any point!

Any good Go game is like that.  Good game.  I think even if you lost that battle in the lower left, it still would've been a close game that you may still win.  My general advice would be to think a little more aggressively, although in the long run that's a playing style decision.  I think most players go through different phases as they advance through their careers.  When I was around 18k, I suddenly made a shift to playing really aggressively and working in battles any chance I got.  It got me up to 15k that way, and then I ended up settling into my more balanced style.  I guess it's like a pendulum, swinging back and forth until finally you reach a point in the middle that is optimal.  Otherwise, good strong playing.  Let me know if you have any questions, or if you want a teaching game or another review.  I'm jemwest on KGS.  Best of luck!]
