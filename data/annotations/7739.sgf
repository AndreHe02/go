AB[pd][dp]C[[Felix\]:
Hi stay,
I'm your reviewer Felix, also known as djifmaster on KGS.
I answered your question with suggestion other moves
Have fun!]FG[259:]PM[2];W[pp]C[stay [12k?\]: hi, have a good game]
;B[dd];W[cf];B[fc]
(;W[cj]LB[ch:A]C[[Felix\]: White is overplaying here. The 3 space jump isn't a stong shape. A splitting attack starting at A is possible.]
;B[nq]LB[cc:C][ic:a][bd:B][cd:D]C[[stay\]: for this move, I wasn't sure whether I still needed to play on the top. I was a bit confused when white played C10, because I didn't know if it was a correct continuation or a mistake by my opponent. Should I have played at 'A' instead?

[Felix\]: The three space jump from White is a weak shape. So there is no additional move on the top necessary. If White plays at 'B', Black can still defend at 'C'. Or after White 'C', Black plays at 'D' and weakens the white formation on the left.]
;W[cn];B[co]LB[ch:D][cl:E][dn:b][en:c][fq:a]TR[cj]C[[stay\]: I did't want to play the usual move at 'A', since I thought that would be give white too much of a good result for his 3-space jumps. By the same token, I was concerned that white would respond at either 'B' or 'C', and all of a sudden his extension from the marked stone was now the proper distance ("extend 3 spaces from 2 stones")

[Felix\]: Playing at 'A' is not bad for black, since White's position is verly low. All stones are on the third line. Playing on the third line often immediatly takes territory, but extension to the center is limited. So White's position may seem good for the moment, but to develope this position into a huge framework is more difficult. Besides White has weaknesses at 'D' and 'E' to defend later.]
;W[en];B[fp];W[bd];B[cc];W[bc]
(;B[qq]LB[ic:a][qn:B]TR[bc]C[[stay\]: I thought that my stones on the upper left were secure enough that I didn't need to answer white's marked move, (since I could always extend to 'A'), so instead I decided to go for the lower right corner with move 14. In looking back now, I wonder if I was as safe on the upper left as I originally thought.

[Felix\]: No worries, you are safe! White's move was not "bad", but it is a move for the late middle game. There are bigger moves, like your move in the lower right corner. But I personally would prefer an approach at 'B'. See the variations for possible continuations.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qr];B[rr]LB[po:A]C[[Felix\]: Playing in the corner is not so important here, better play at 'A' to develope on the right side.]
;W[pr];B[qo];W[po];B[qn];W[mo]LB[mp:A]TR[rr]C[[Felix\]: Because of playing the marked stone. White's outcome is quite ok (allthough he should play at 'A'). Black is in a low position on the right.]
;B[kq];W[lp];B[lq];W[mq]
(;B[jp]LB[ip:C][mp:B][mr:A]C[[Felix\]: You really should have played at 'A'. White will answer at 'B' and you can play at 'C', taking nice territory on the bottom or play somewhere else.]
;W[mr]LB[pj:a]C[[stay\]: When white dropped to N2 with move 29, I became concerned for the bottom "territory", but thought that taking tenuki and playing instead at 'A' was a bigger move.

[Felix\]: Yes, playing at 'A' is a very big move.];B[pj];W[qf]
;B[qh];W[of];B[nd];W[mf];B[le]LB[jc:B][ld:A]C[[Felix\]: Usually you want to play at 'A'. There is no need in "attacking" White here. Calmly take your territory at the top. Plus, playing this moves makes it easier for White to invade around 'B'.]
;W[me];B[md]
(;W[lf];B[ke];W[rd];B[qc]LB[ef:A]
(;W[rc]LB[ef:A]C[[Felix\]: White playing this move is quite small. Black should not answer! Actually the biggest move for both players is 'A'. See the variations for White/Black playing at 'A'!]
(;B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[rf];B[rg]LB[ef:A]C[[stay\]: Not sure about my move at S13. Wanted to protect the right side, but that could have been out of fear or greed. Not sure if there are better moves... maybe something on the top?

[Felix\]: 'A' is still the biggest move.];W[qg]
(;B[rh]LB[hd:a][he:b][ef:D][bn:c]TR[rg]C[[stay\]: should I have skipped this move, and instead play around 'A' or 'B', or even 'C'? Even if white had atari my marked stone, I could then have done my own atari to their stone, and stop its advance (done in the variation). Is this thinking correct?

[Felix\]: The thinking is correct! Play elsewhere instead of answering White's small moves. Allthough I think 'D' is the best move to play.]
;W[pe];B[bo];W[bn];B[lr]LB[ef:C][jg:E][om:D][gn:F][jr:a][ks:B]
C[[stay\]: I know, ugly move. To stop a potential invasion of white, should i have played around 'A' instead? This way I wouldn't make bad shape.

[Felix\]: Locally 'A' or 'B' are better than the empty triangle move, but globally you should play at 'C', 'D', 'E' or 'F'.]
;W[nr];B[kp]C[[Felix\]: This move is wasted. Now you have double empty triagle. ;-)]
;W[ko];B[pn]LB[ef:A][jg:D][om:C][gn:B]C[[Felix\]: 'A' to 'D' are better.]
;W[on]
(;B[ic]LB[ef:A][jg:B]SQ[dd][ed][fe][ge][he][ie][je][ke]C[[Felix\]: I drew an imaginary line, to visualize why this move is bad. You played in your own territory. You should at least play at the boarder of your territory, or even enlargen it with playing at 'A' or 'B'. You may feared a White invasion. The variation shows, why that would be bad.]
;W[cb];B[db];W[cd];B[dc];W[ca];B[da];W[bb];B[ck]LB[ef:B][jg:C]
[om:D][hp:a]TR[bn][cn][en]C[[stay\]: Was undecided between playing at C9, move 68, or instead play at 'A'. At the end I decided that even if white played himself at 'A' as a response to my move, I'd be able to handle it. The reason for the attachment is that I was hoping to do a leaning attack on the marked stones, but that didn't work out quite that way.

[Felix\]: For me, playing at C9 is a rather aggressive move. At this time of the game you have a big lead so you should simplify the game. But C9 complicates it. Playing 'A' to 'D' is enough. White is the one to play more aggressive.]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[gq];B[gp];W[iq];B[hr];W[ip];B[ir];W[fq];B[eq]
;W[er];B[fr];W[jq];B[jr];W[jo];B[gr]C[[stay\]: I realize this move was wasteful. Didn't need it and could have done better somewhere else.

[Felix\]: That is correct!];W[eo];B[ep]C[[Felix\]: White's move is no threat, so answering it is another wasted move.]
;W[hn];B[in]LB[dj:A]C[[Felix\]: I don't understand this move. You should finish what you have begun on the left with playing at 'A' for example (or one of the other moves I showed previously).]

[as][bs][cs][ds][es][fs][gs][hs][is][js][ks]C[[stay\]: I left the cutting point at 'A', thinking that if a fight broke out I'd be able to handle it. So, I played at G16, thinking to isolate white's marked stones. Looking back, and even though I did win the eventual fight, it may have been a foolish thing to do.

[Felix\]: You are right, it was quite foolish. But the important thing to me in this situation is, that you continue to complicate the game. Simple moves! Your lead is so big. I visualized the territory, so that you can "see" it.
It is an important principle of the go game, not to want more in any situation. You only need more than your opponent has.]

;W[dn];B[dl];W[bm];B[al];W[im];B[hm]C[[stay\]: lol. not even sure why I did this. At this point of the game was beginning to get tired, so started making (even more) silly mistakes. I'm ending my comments at this move. Thank you for reviewing my game, I really appreciate it :-)

[Felix\]: Your lead is very big, so these silly mistakes don't make you loose the game. :-D
I'll also end my review at this point. I hope I could give you at least some helpful advice.
