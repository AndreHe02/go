;B[qc];W[kc];B[ic];W[dj]LB[cf:A]C[Chris: Good. Play at the largest empty space. A also possible.]
;B[fq]
(;W[jq]TR[dj]C[Chris: This pincer in combination with the other wide extension is inferior. After 3-3 one of the 2 marked stones will be positioned badly.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep]
(;B[fp];W[fo]C[is push and cut at E3 better?
Chris: Yes, but even if push and cut, the situation is not so good for White. It is all because of the wide choice of pincer. Try to see why K3 was not a good idea.]
;B[eq];W[go];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]C[Chris: Playable, but imho White is a bit smaller than Black.]
;B[on]
(;W[qp]LB[dj:14]C[Chris: Slow and really unimportant. W14 is "open-skirted". White should prevent Black making White too small there by kakari.]
;B[ro];W[cf];B[df]C[Chris: I have heard recently, the japanese call this the "kyu-player joseki" ^^ Im not sure if thats true.]
;W[dg];B[ce];W[ef];B[de]
(;W[cg]TR[go][fo]LB[bf:A]C[Chris: This is wrong direction. With the marked stones in place, White should move towards the centre, not the side. If you have a terretorial/fighting style, you can try A, to prepare an invasion.]
;B[eg];W[ff];B[fg];W[gg];B[fi]
(;W[gh]C[Chris: This seems to help Black make good shape. Better squeeze.]
;B[ei];W[he];B[di]LB[ei:A]TR[ef][ff]C[Chris: Your side suffers! If you would get a decent attack as an exchange it would be ok, but there is even no attack. When you cannot attack the A group, the cutting stones  become almost useless and should be sacrificed.]

;B[fe];W[ge]C[solid connection better? 
Chris: no];B[ee];W[gf];B[gc]C[Chris: White is behind a little. But Blacks centre group is not alive yet, so White needs to find a way to attack, thats benefitial.]

;B[re];W[od];B[pc];W[pg];B[oh];W[oc];B[qd];W[oe]C[Chris: This move is worth 1 point. You seem to be very keen on playing small stuff while bigger things are still to be done (in endgame should be sente). Try to think about an overall strategy when you attack, when to attack, and what you would like to get in return. I would recommend tesuji problems, as those would help you make better shape and learn not to be so greedy over one or two or even more stones.]
