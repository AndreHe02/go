C[*X*: Hi.  Hope I can be of help.  I'm a strong strategic player, not a tactical one, so I hope your mistakes are mostly strategic, since I'm not good at reading.  I'll do my best.  Anyway, all my comments will be prefixed with *X* (for "Xopods," my IGS/KGS/DGS username) to distinguish them from yours.

---

This was a very intense game for me, which I lost by 7.5 points. I see some mistakes I made, which I mention in comments, but I am sure I made others I missed.]
;B[pd]C[*X*: This is your first mistake.  No, just kidding.  I'll be serious from now on, I promise.]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dc]
(;B[de]C[*X*: I can't say this is bad, but the most common joseki at your level for the high approach to komoku will end in gote for you.  Maybe it would be better for you to enclose the bottom left at P3 first, because that will be kind of sente.  In combination with a shimari in the bottom right and the hoshi in the top right, Q10 would be too good for Black.  White is almost obliged to immediately play e.g. R10 to prevent this, and you'll still be able to play your approach afterwards.

As White now, I might ignore D15 and Play P3.];W[ce];B[dd];W[cd]
;B[ec]C[*X*: Here begins the small avalanche joseki, which I don't know well (read: at all).  In fact, it's complicated enough that even at my level (5k* IGS) I try to avoid it.  Anyway, I'll pull out my handy-dandy "Essential Joseki" by Rui Nai-wei 9d and see what I can do.]
;W[db];B[df]C[Is this the correct response to D18, which I think may be an underplay?

*X*: Well, Rui Nai-wei doesn't give it as a variation, so either it's wrong, or just very obscure.  It doesn't look like an overplay, so I guess you're right that it's an underplay.  As for how you can punish it, well... this point (D14) and one to the left (C14) are the places that White is supposed to play (not both obviously, just one... D14 is small avalanche, C14 and Black D14 large avalanche).  Going by the philosophy that the opponent's good move is your good move, this seems fine to me.]

(;W[oq]C[*X*: I think this is bad by White.  If you get to E18 first, you get an awfully strong wall facing your Q16 hoshi stone.  I think E18 is EXTREMELY urgent.]
;B[pq]TR[kp][lp][kq][lq]C[*X*: Please unlearn this move.  I see so many lower-range double-digit kyus (10-15k) playing this, and it's terrible.  After the inevitable response P4, you still have to make an extension on the right side, and White gets the ideal extension from her two-stone wall along the bottom.  It isn't as bad here as the same move from a hoshi stone (since that still leaves the corner ripe for invasion), but it's still bad.  The case when it's playable is when you have a stone in place to prevent the White extension, e.g. one of the triangled points, or when White already has a stone too close, e.g. N3 or M3.]
;W[op];B[fd]C[*X*: Bad.  Two problems.  First, E18 is just better, since this allows White a good kikashi (see variation) and the cut at E16 wouldn't work anyway, since you can catch in geta (B E18, W E16, B F14).  Second, a White attack around R6 is very severe (or, if White doesn't want to fight, she could just press down with Q6 etc. and build influence facing her hoshi).  You need to extend to R7 on the right side.]

(;W[fq];B[cf]C[*X*: Big to be sure, but an extension along the right is still urgent.]
;W[bb]C[*X*: I don't think this is necessary.  I don't see any problem with White at B14 instead, but I may be wrong.]
;B[dj];W[cm];B[jp]C[*X*: Good!  Extending along the right and allowing a White extension To L3 makes things good for White.  Although I'd actually prefer to play a little closer to the two white stones to make the attack more severe.  You have to worry about a White counterattack at R6 though.]
;W[lq];B[pm]C[*X*: At last!  I think I'd prefer R7, but I can't say this is bad.  You're lucky White never played R6 though.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[*X*: A pincer is absolutely essential here.  The E18-F18 weakness you left makes it hard to get much going along the top, whereas if White extends along the right (as I imagine she will), your choice of Q7 instead of R7 will leave you with an open skirt.  See variation.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]C[*X*: Sure enough, you're left with a terrible weakness at R6, due to bad joseki choice and playing Q7 instead of R7.  I was going to say "See variation next move"  but going a bit ahead, I now see that I don't even need to make a variation, since White plays R6 immediately... QED.

At this point, I would say the game is already lost for Black.]
;B[jc]C[*X*: Good.  Last big point.  Would be MUCH larger if you'd played E18 instead of F16, though.]
;W[qn]C[*X*: Heh.  Great move by White for later in the game.  I didn't even need to put in the variation I thought I would.  HOWEVER, I think it's too early for this right now.  Black might want to ignore this and play E18 now, since that's worth at least 15 points of solid territory.  I don't think that White can kill the corner outright in one move, although you'll have to come back very soon to defend.]
;B[pn];W[qm];B[qo]
(;W[qk]C[*X*: White should cut at Q5.  Cause big problems for Black.  See variation.]
;B[rn];W[pl];B[rm];W[ql];B[or]C[*X*: Connecting at Q5 is extremely urgent.  If White captures those two stones, White bottom side moyo is HUGE.]
;W[nr];B[pr]C[I can now be cut at Q5, but I thought it worth it to solidify the corner and weaken white on the lower side

----

*X*: Saving the two stones weakens White much more than the second line hane you played.  If White captures them, White's thickness is unstoppable.]

(;W[lo]C[*X*: Boo.  White should cut.]
(;B[ho]C[Is this a good move? I made it more or less by instinct

---

*X*: I don't like it, because it can be cut, but it's too close to be light.  You should either play solidly, e.g. jump straight up to K6, or do something sabaki-ish, e.g. F2 (actually, I don't know if F2 is good, because sabaki is dan-level stuff, but see variation for my attempt.]
;W[lc]C[*X*: White should be tormenting the Black weak group at the bottom.]
;B[po]C[I thought this was more important than protecting the top side.

---

*X*: Yeah, probably... although doing something on the top is still huge.  Anyway, White is far ahead now.]
;W[le];B[mb];W[lb];B[mc];W[md];B[kd];W[ld];B[ne];W[hc]C[*X*: Not bad, making miai of connecting with F18 or jumping out and attacking K17/L16.  Black is in tatters.]

;B[il];W[im];B[gl]C[*X*: Hm.  Interesting.  Don't know if this is right or wrong.  My suspicion is that it's wrong.  Even if it isn't, your continuation is wrong because you end up very heavy.]

[rs][ss]C[*X*: Well, there was a lot of complicated fighting later in the game that you seem to be able to read at least as well as me, and that almost saved the game for you.  But by all rights this game should have been a landslide victory for White.  She missed several opportunities to kill Black.  

Anyway, your problems mostly seem to be with fuseki and early middle game.  Believe it or not, the game-losing moves were 15 and 25.  Don't leave yourself with open skirts.  Don't defend cutting points that aren't actually cutting points.  And don't play joseki you know just because you know them.  Better to play something you don't know that fits with the overall position.  Chances are, your opponent won't know the joseki either.  Moves like 25 are the reason for the proverb "Studying joseki loses 2 stones strength."]

If Black now defends the top side with the E18 I keep mentioning, White swallows K4 with e.g. J7 and the game is over.  If Black jumps out to J7 himself, White chases him around a bit, makes sure to end in sente, and lays waste to the top side with F18.]
