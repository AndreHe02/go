Hi, my name is Marc (~8kyu) and I am the reviewer of your game.

First I have to say that you should study some Fusekis (opening moves)
because it looks like you sometimes do not know where to play next (at the beginning).
For studying Fusekis I strongly recommend: 

http://www.josekipedia.com/ (for the corner josekis at the beginning)
and

http://senseis.xmp.net/?FusekiPages

Furthermore you should not play as defensive as in this game.
Sometimes you have to take a risk in order to win something (this is the philosophy of go).

I would also recommend doing live and death problems on: http://www.goproblems.com/

Do not try to protect each stone. Sacrificing stones is sometimes necessary in order to
get a better position on the board.

The last advice: 
You should not use programs like SmartGo for auto analysing your games.
I would always prefer a discussion with your opponent after the match (somtimes he/she could tell
you which moves he feared or what you can do better or the over way around :-) ), 
GTL or reviews from other strong players.

The most computer programs are simply to weak to show you a good (or even the best) move (on a 19x19 board)!]

It might be very greate :-) (see Variations).]

(;B[fg]C[To slow....

Always keep in mind, to concentrate on the border's first  (then on the center)
because it is easier to get points and influence.];W[fe];B[ee]
C[This move was a mistake.  Should have extended at G16];W[ed]
;B[de]C[Thinking process was that it would force C16 and I could capture F15 with G15]
;W[cd]TR[de][ee]C[You should play G16 here.
The two marked stones are not that important to keep them alive (see Variations).

Sometimes it is neccessary to sacrifice stones in order to get more influence (aji or even territory).]
(;B[ge];W[fc];B[gd];W[gc];B[hc];W[hb];B[ic];W[ib]C[You should play hane as you are a bit behind there,
but K17 is not such a bad move.];B[jc]C[Not sure if I should extend or hane.  Played it safe (my instinct is to hane too much)]
;W[df]TR[de][ee]C[As I earlier mentioned it would be clever to secrifice the two marked stones.]
(;B[ef];W[dg];B[ch]C[This sequence turns up again in the lower part of the board.  I'm not sure what the best response is.
(see earlier variations; especially the fuseki at the beginning!!!)]
;W[eg];B[ff];W[ei]LB[ei:B][dj:A]C[D10 would be greate.];B[jg]

;W[fh];B[gh];W[gi];B[hh];W[cf];B[ck]C[Need to provide a base for the C12 group]
;W[cq]C[Big mistake from white here because black will usually get high influence on the lower and left border.]
;B[dq]C[I only know one joseki, and this is it :P  I place the wall so that it will radiate influence towards the other corner, since it's the widest.]

;W[jq];B[lq]TR[np][oq][pq]C[I wasn't sure what the best response was.  Either this or H3, probably, but H3 felt over concentrated.

//

As the 3 marked stones would be in danger, when white plays at M3,
M3 is the best response for black (in this case).

Note: This problem (with the 3 marked stones) just occurs because black missed to play at K3 at the beginning (fuseki)!]
;W[hq];B[ho];W[jo];B[lo];W[hp];B[jm]C[I was trying to limit his ability to grow, but instead he forms a net and gains eyespace.  So this move probably would have been better at J5?

//

This move looks like, black tries to capture white. 
As this isn't possible black should play J5 (yes).];W[io];B[go]
;W[kn];B[ln];W[km];B[jl]C[Here's that pattern again.  Not sure what the proper response is.

//

K8 is okay here.];W[kl];B[qh];W[oc]C[Black could be very happy with white P17...

Usually white would  respond with R10 :-)];B[qk];W[nb];B[mc]

The lower right black group is alive since black played M6.
So, connecting is not neccessary...

Black may play at E9 or R7 instead.];W[fl];B[fk]C[I wasn't sure what to do here.  If I defend at like F6 or F7 he has huge gains.  But in retrospect that probably would have been safer.]
;W[gk]C[Black should cut at G8.]
(;B[ek];W[gl];B[gm];W[fm];B[gn];W[en];B[eo];W[dn];B[fn]C[My goal is to protect the cutting point at D5.  If he goes there, I go at E7 and capture the group of three stones and gain eye space.  In the mean time, I have two eye potentials here.  F5 and E3-E4.]

You should better save the two marked stones :-).];W[im]C[He destroys one eye space.]
;B[hm];W[in];B[il];W[kj];B[ik];W[jj]C[Trying to make him over concentrated with bad shape.  Not sure if that's what I actually accomplished

White does not really need to play at K10 as his group  and the black group are alive.
