AB[dp][pd][pp]C[Hello Reviewer

This was a game where I was playing white against an opponent with a handicap of three stones.  I am particularly bad at oppenings in all my games, handicap and even, and tend to overplay moves which then leaves me scrambling to make up for it in the middlegame. Im also not that great at the endgame either. If possible can you review this game for white and for black as well. I am particularly interested to know how exactly white should approach handicap games, in what direction should white stones be played etc. and where and how to exploit weakness I have added some comments myself to hopefully make your job a bit easier. Also, I should probably mention that im not really familiar with any joseki so Im probably not playing very standard corner sequences.

Thank You.

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt.  I'm 2dan at the local club which means I'm too weak to tell you what the correct moves are, but maybe I can give you ideas what to think about.
Please use an sgf reader that displays variations properly - cgoban1, qgo, jago, gGo, glGo all work, but cgoban2 (the KGS client) has some problems.

I think, apart from some tactical mistakes, the main area where you need to improve is to consider the relative strength and weakness of the groups on the board.  Strengthen your weak groups, don't play near strong ones, etc.]

;W[qf]C[sinful1: I dont know if this is that good or not, i really like getting the double approach on the corner however the results were dismal]
;B[nd]
(;W[rd]TR[nc][nd]C[crux: This move is completely beside the point.  Black and white stones just came in contact with the marked exchange; it's usually best to continue locally.]
;B[rg];W[qg];B[rh]
(;W[qc]LB[pc:A]C[crux: Since (as you point out later) White has a bit of a shape problem, I wonder if a move at A could work better.  I've attached some variations that came to mind, but I don't know the best line of play.]
;B[pc];W[qb];B[pb]LB[mc:A]C[crux: Black should probably play A instead.]
;W[md]LB[rf:A]C[sinful1: black r15 would be hugely problematic for me, i noticed it during the game as well i just sort of hoped my opponent wouldnt play it.

crux: It might be better to just defend at A.  Attacks tend to backfire when your own groups aren't solid.  When I have White in a handicap game I usually play for strong positions early on.]
;B[ne];W[og];B[mc];W[lc]C[crux: A move like this must have a plan behind it - if you don't know yet how it will help you, leave it unplayed to preserve aji.]
;B[mb];W[ld];B[lb];W[kb];B[nb];W[mg]TR[kb][lc][ld]C[crux: You can't just leave the cut for Black.  If you feel that you need to move out with the right group, then it would have been better not to make the marked moves - you've just created a burden for yourself, and made Black's group 100% alive.]
;B[kc]
(;W[jc]LB[jb:A]C[crux: The ladder doesn't work, but extending at A isn't attractive either.]
;B[kd];W[ke];B[jd];W[id];B[je];W[jf];B[ie]C[crux: Not sure what you're trying to achieve by playing out a malfunctioning ladder.]

(;W[lf]SQ[lc][ld][md]TR[ie][jd][je][kc][kd]C[crux: If you wanted to defend here you could have done so a few moves ago without strengthening Black unnecessarily.  The triangled black stones cannote be captured, hence the marked white stones are strategically unimportant.  That means that defending them is the wrong move at this point (just a small endgame play).]
;B[ic];W[hd]TR[id]C[crux: That stone is meaningless.  No reason to save it.]
;B[jb]C[sinful1: white has weakness everywhere now, and black has setteled, a poor result for me.]
;W[jq];B[co];W[bo];B[dn]LB[bp:A]C[crux: Should protect the corner at A, I think.  Still, White doesn't get a good result out of this.  I've added a few variations that look plausible to me.]

C[crux: This greatly weakens your outside stones.  Maybe link up with A instead?]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq]TR[jq][no][nq]C[crux: Three weak white stones in a sea of Black's strength.]
;W[ro];B[qo];W[rn];B[rm];W[rp];B[qm];W[nm];B[nr];W[jo]LB[lo:A]
C[crux: I'd prefer a move at A to make some shape for the three stones on the right.  As it stands now Black can separate you.]
;B[fc]LB[cf:A]C[crux: Black makes the mistake of extending from strong stones.  White should play at A since the hoshi stone is getting weak.]
;W[cm]C[crux: Saving this stone doesn't have much meaning, it just invites Black to take more profit on the edge.]
