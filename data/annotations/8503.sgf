C[Dear reviewer,

I added some thoughts I had during the game, so you might better understand my moves.
I would especially be happy about some advice regarding the handling of White's mini chinese formation and reducing the left side. Of course I'm also happy about any other comments to improve my game.
Thanks in advance!

Best regards,

LB[eh:B][ci:A]C[I was thinking about A as well. But I thought that after this, White could slide into the corner or cut off the black stone at B.

[dq:C][eq:B]TR[gk][hk][iq]C[White's group seems fine now. So I feel like I have to reduce White's territory.
Because of the marked White stones, the escape route to the center seems blocked.
A and B seemed not to work here, so I tried a rather unorthodox approach at C. Better possibilities to reduce White's territory here?
