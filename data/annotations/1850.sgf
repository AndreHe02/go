C[Hello,
  I have started playing Go about a month ago so I am not very strong.  I
started out playing from a freeware program called "IgoWin" (9x9 board),
try to solve many go problems weekly from goproblems.com, and I play
5-10 games weekly.  I want to be able to become stronger in the game,
therefore, I would like a reviewer to look at one of my better games up
to date.
  I was playing BLACK in the game and the komi was 0.5.  I don't know what
my ranking is on IGS (Internet Go Servers) so I would like the reviewer
to give me an estimate on my ranking.
  Basically, I am looking for some advice on how to improve my game.
    Thanks and I will be looking forward to my first game reviewed,
  James];B[dp]C[Hi James,   1 month in go.... good luck...

you are approaching a corner.];W[cn]C[This response is ok,....  but i would not expect W leave just one stone at the previous corner...]

(;B[dj]C[And I would expect Black to do the same....
:)

The variations will get more and more complicated... Therefore I would stick to basic plays until I figure out the subtleties... Look at the variation shown.

[bn:4][cp:3]SQ[dm][cn]C[not bad till here....

Marked stones are weak. Black is not in immediate danger. But the two W stones are...

Black can always go towards the center (1)
push W (2) : this is not very good.
close the corner to W and get the corner for himself (3)
create a base for himself.(4)];B[al]C[This is not necessary...   It is ok, if you do not play it...]

(;W[qg]LB[qo:A]C[This move is interesting...

If W wants to use his recently played stones as a wall, he is better of playing "A" first. That moves is a big threat to the corner group (in connection with the cut that I have shown before) and build the wall to make this move more efficient.]

In general i can say the following:

- try to play a simpler game, it will make you understand / analyze your mistakes easier and advance faster.
- have a clear plan... know why you are doing sth.
- never leave a weak group behind to make an invasion or attack. you will have two weak groups in the end...
- because of the same reasoning, be careful not to be cut.

overall it was a pretty good game for Black.   White did not capitilize on Black's mistakes... If he had done, score would be a lot different...

But good progress for a month of play...
