AB[pd][dp]C[Hello!

My name is Roland Schatz. I'm playing black in this game, as flOvermind. The game was played on IGS.

My IGS rank is 14k?, the opponent is 13k+. I was promoted a game before this one. This is the third game against this opponent, the first two were 3 handicap, of which I won the first by a few points and the second by resignation because of a big mistake of my opponent.

I chose this game to get reviewed because I think I have not made any major mistakes, at least none that I noticed. Still I lost the game by 7.5.

The problem I have with this game is, that even after reviewing it myself, I just don't know what I could have done differently. Ok, I found a few minor mistakes, but considering this is a handicap game, none of them were large enough to justify the loss.

I reviewed this game myself, writing down the reasoning behind my moves. At a few points I'm pretty sure my moves were not very good, but I still couldn't find any better moves.

I would appreciate if you could point out the mistakes I made in the game and also in my reasoning behind my moves.

Thanks in advance

Hi, my name is Bernd Sambale, I'm a KGS 5k, so probably on IGS only 6 or 7k. Okay, here comes the review! ^_^]
;W[pp];B[dc]C[Roland: I'm a bit at loss with the 4-4 opening, that's why I played 3-4 here.

I know how to approach or invade 4-4 when the opponent uses it, but I don't know how to properly use it myself. This is going to cause a bit of trouble later in the bottom left corner ;)]
;W[cd]C[Roland: White wants to invade straight away, so I decide to build a wall facing the top side, forming a big mojo with Q16.]
;B[dd];W[de];B[fd];W[cc];B[ee];W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[jd]C[Roland: The stones on the left seem strong enough, so extend to the top.

Bernd: Good plan, successful execution.];W[db]C[Bernd: You can prevent the empty triangle as I have showed in the variations.]

(;B[ec];W[qf]TR[oe][nf][mg][lh][ki]C[Bernd: One thing at this point. As I think, there are now two basic ways to continue: Either you break the connection between whites stones with a pincer and concentrate on fighting, or you rely on your moyo. Maybe there's some absolute category to judge this, but I think, it's also a matter of style. Since you chose your moyo, I will concentrate on this.

There are two moyos: one at the upper side, and later one at the right side. If the borderline was at the diagonal, the moyos would be about of equal size (that is: if you manage to take away the lower right corner). Now if one of you manages to push the borderline farther towards the enemy, he will have the advantage.]
;B[nc];W[rd]C[Bernd: Now you shouldn't play the joseki to the end, since your moyo is more important.]

(;B[qc];W[of]C[Bernd: Now he got a crucial point on the diagonal.]
;B[nq]C[Roland: The top is safe enough for now, so let's do something at the bottom ;)]
;W[pq];B[kq];W[pl];B[hp]C[Roland: White builds a mojo on the right, so I build one at the bottom. To me it seems I'm ahead, so I don't want to complicate things by invading.

Bernd: Good idea, invasion now would only hurt other places.]
;W[dj];B[cm];W[cq]C[Roland: This is the problem I have with 4-4 openings (and handicap games). I never know the right moment to close the corner. Should I have closed it earlier, or is the invasion ok?

Bernd: This is very normal. When you play on hoshi, you don't count the corner as your territory in the first place.]
;B[dq]C[Roland: I try to build a wall facing the bottom side, as this strengthens my mojo.

Bernd: Correct.];W[dr];B[er]C[Roland: Of course the opponent won't let me build my wall. This is a point where I'm not entirely sure about my moves, but in the end it seemed to go rather well...]
;W[br];B[ds];W[cr];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[aq]
(;B[co]LB[co:A]C[Roland: I propably shouldn't have defended here. The cut works, but it's not very large. See variations.

Bernd: True. The first variation is good. Up to here you did well.]
;W[cs]
(;B[eq]C[Roland: This shape doesn't look good, but I have to defend the cut.]
;W[es];B[fr]C[Roland: Again an empty triangle, the whole thing looks pretty ugly, but I don't see a better move.

But it's very solid, so I should be able to make some large mojo around it (at least that's what I thought during the game...)

Bernd: With my variation you have no empty triangles.];W[no]
LB[oj:A]TR[pd][oe][nf][mg][lh][ki][kl][lm][mn][op][pq]C[Bernd: Now let's look again at the moyo relationship. White was able to get the advantage points at both moyo diagonals.

I'm not perfectly sure, but ... the most dangerous thing about your enemy is that moyo, so probably you should try to reduce it from a point like A. Maybe the following fight will weaken other places. Better was to prevent white from getting both vital points in the first place.]

(;B[bj];W[bh];B[eb];W[cb];B[rc];W[re];B[me];W[ci];B[ck];W[pi]
;B[mg]TR[ef]C[Roland: Now the corners and sides are pretty much settled, time to go for the center. This is usually where the problems start in my games.

Bernd: Maybe you have the idea that there's anything to get in the center, but at most times that is not the case. As they tell you in beginner's books: Territory is in the corners and at the edge. If you rely on center territory you will lose often, because it is very rarely possible to get a large territory there. You have to concentrate on the corners and the edge while taking care to have enough center influence to counter anything your opponent tries there.

Roland: Up to here I thought I was doing pretty well. I seem to be slightly ahead in territory, and the mojo between the triangle stone and the last move looks promising.

Bernd: But you shouldn't be slightly ahead, you should be a lot ahead now. Remember the moyo diagonals, they maybe were the crucial points of this game!]
;W[jg]C[Roland: This move completely caught me off guard. I don't know how to properly react to this kind of deep reduction. I always feel I should be able to do better, but I don't see how exactly...

Bernd: This was a good point for him to reduce, and moyos get reduced, it's just the way it is. You just have to try and get as much outside influence as you can!]
;B[fh]C[Roland: First, cut off the obvious escape route.

Bernd: Good idea.];W[hg];B[lh]C[Roland: Then push into my strong stones to the left.]
;W[lf];B[mf];W[le];B[ld];W[lg];B[kh];W[jh]
(;B[kg]TR[le][lf][lg]SQ[hg][jg][jh]C[Roland: I don't think I can stop the square stones from escaping, so I just capture the triangled ones...

Bernd: Don't give up on this fight yet! Go on attacking and taking away eyespace (see variations)!]
;W[je]C[Roland: I didn't expect this reply. I can still capture the stones, but my mojo is further reduced...

Would it have been better to not try to capture the stones, and take some more territory at the top? E.g. J15?]

(;B[jf]LB[ie:B][jf:A];W[if];B[ke];W[ie];B[id];W[hd];B[hc];W[gd]
;B[gc];W[gf];B[ge]C[Roland: In hindsight, I think I should have left the situation at this point, the white stones are alive as they are...

In the game it didn't really matter, because white always replied to my moves, so I didn't lose sente.

Bernd: But your thinking is correct.];W[he];B[ff];W[gh];B[dk]
LB[el:A][fl:B][lp:C]C[Roland: Was this too slow?

Bernd: You could have tried A or B. The problem is: if you build a wall towards the upper side, he comes from the right, maybe at C. If you block him there, he comes from above (miai). You won't keep a lot of territory anyway.]
;W[kf]C[Roland: I don't understand this move. I don't think this does anything at all except forcing a reply...

Bernd: And you're right about it.];B[jf];W[kf];B[lf]C[Roland: This was not neccesary, I should have played elsewhere.

Bernd: Correct.];W[gi];B[ej]
(;W[fi];B[fj];W[ei];B[gj];W[hm]LB[jm:A]TR[of][no]C[Roland: Again a deep reduction, and again I don't know how to deal with it. This time I have even stronger stones in the surroundings, but it doesn't really do me any good.

Bernd: This is because he is also strong in the area. He's got that group at the top center and the monster moyo at the right. Enough space to run and hide - or something worse.

The only thing you could try is to cut him off from his allies, maybe at A, and go for an all out attack. The right moyo got too large, so it's hard to win now. If you manage at least to get more strengh to the right side, you could still try an invasion, but to be honest, it seems damn difficult, maybe impossible, to me. If at least the triangled stones weren't there ...]
;B[ik]C[Roland: Try to cut the escape route to the top.

Bernd: Problem: Like this you force him into the direction of his moyo, where he wants to get anyway.]
;W[jm];B[im]C[Roland: I thought I could cut here, but it didn't work. Still, white didn't get much deeper into my mojo, so I think the move was not that bad.

Bernd: Remember one basic principle of fighting: Don't attach weak stones. If you attach them, you make them stronger.

The same is true the other way around: If you are weak in enemy territory, attach the stones to get stronger yourself.]
;W[il];B[in];W[hk];B[hj];W[jk]C[Bernd: Look at this: what has your attaching got you? This group is still connected, even better than before, and it's even more probable now that it will escape to the right side moyo, and you haven't got anything for this.]
;B[gk];W[hl];B[gm];W[hn];B[gn];W[jn]
(;B[ho]LB[ho:A][io:B]C[Roland: I propably should have saved the two stones (see variations).

Bernd: Two stones more or less are not that important - look at the moyo he has built in the right center!]
;W[gl];B[fl];W[io];B[ip];W[jp];B[jq]C[Roland: Now that the situation is settled, the territory looks rather small, considering how big the mojo looked just a few moves before...

Bernd: Yeah. Although you made it easy for him through attaching, it is the normal way a moyo goes: In the end it's never as big as it looked before. The problem is: You haven't got anything back for his successful reduction. He even was able to enlarge his own moyo.]
;W[lo];B[kp]
(;W[jo];B[or];W[pr];B[ps];W[qs];B[os];W[qr]
(;B[mj]LB[mj:A][mk:B]C[Roland: Now it's time to dive into the white mojo. Should this have been deeper? I don't think I could stay connected when I jump in deeper (see variations)...

Bernd: I have added another variation. I think you could have gone to B.]
;W[mq]
(;B[mr]LB[mp:A]C[Bernd: I think you can trap that stone with A instead (see variations).]
;W[lq];B[lr];W[nk];B[mk];W[ml]C[Roland: Now there are a lot of endgame reductions. By now I realised the result was going to be really close...

Bernd: Unfortunately more than close, wasn't it? ^_° I also am not good at counting yet. I sometimes try and estimate, but seldomly I know what's going on ...]
;B[kj];W[nj];B[ni];W[oi];B[nh];W[oh];B[ll];W[lm];B[kl];W[km]
;B[jj];W[ng];B[mi];W[sc];B[sb];W[sd];B[ra]C[Roland: I should have done a solid connection here, but that's just a minor mistake, it cost me only a half point ko in the end...

Bernd: True. 

From here on there are no more in-game comments, the endgame was alright. Anyway, at our point of play (below dan) basic strategy and fighting skill are more important, I think, than the few points you get in the endgame, as long as you try to get all the sente points.]

Roland: To sum up:

As you can see, I have found a few mistakes by myself. Or at least points where I think I made mistakes. But none were really big mistakes as far as I can tell. Still white managed to catch up on the handicap and won the game...

Besides finding ways to improve my game, I'd also like my reasoning to be verified or corrected. Even if a move is correct, if I played it for the wrong reason, it was pure luck that I picked the correct one ;)

Thanks again for taking the time for this review

Bernd: I will also try a short summary. You should try two things in your future games. 

1.: When you build moyos, think about the borderline, and how you can get the most of it.

2.: When you attack an invader, do it the way that you build strength to a weak enemy area. And after you have built up some strength, take sente and counter invade.]
