C[The game was interesting to review.  You both made one serious mistake in the beginning. After that your playing was very reasonable.
Please keep in mind, that i am only a 3kyu in my country, so thia review might contain serious misreads.
All my comments are beginning with ph.

Peter Hoehe];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ec];B[pk];W[ce]C[ph: strange move. Perhaps black should exploit the weakness at 4-4 at once.]

(;B[jd];W[jq];B[cj]C[ph: This allowes a double wing formation by white. But it is not nessecarily bad.]
;W[cl]C[ph: Good];B[cg];W[el];B[dd]C[ph: That looks risky. What if white stretches the other side discarding the corner? (see var)]

(;W[cd];B[dc];W[cc];B[ee];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[ge]LB[fc:A]C[ph: That does not work. It only helps to connect your stones. But they have no eye shape. So Better play at A and virtually catch the white stone. But the 3 black stones remain in a dangerous position.]
;W[db]C[ph: Correct.];B[de]LB[fc:A]C[ph: Blunder. A better move locally is at A. Black may loose 2 stones but gets a little outward influence.]
;W[fe]C[ph: Naturally.];B[mq]TR[cg][dg][cj]C[ph: The 3 black stones are in a dangerous position.]
;W[jo];B[fq]TR[jd][pd][pk][pq][mq]C[ph: Much too deep. This calls for trouble. The alternative is to create a moyo yourself. The 5 black stones begin to surround it.]
;W[eq]LB[dr:A]C[ph: Attaching means strengthening. A move around A might be better.]

(;B[fp]LB[gn:A]C[ph: So the white move has done its purpose, making black heavy inside his territory.  A move at A may be possible. (see var)]
;W[hq]C[ph: Good, throwing the 2 black stones in the direction to the 3 other stones.]
;B[cq]LB[nk:A][qd:B][dk:C][fk:D]C[ph: Its ok to take the corner, but there are bigger moves available. I think of A, B or C and then D ?]
;W[cp]
(;B[dq]LB[er:A]C[ph: A does the trick of connecting. (see var)]
;W[er]C[ph: Correct.];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co]LB[ep:A]C[ph That is wrong. Black can cut now at A.]
;B[dr];W[ds]LB[ep:A]C[ph: Connecting at A would be great. The black corner needs one more move to be alive.]
;B[ep]C[ph: Correct.];W[fr];B[gr];W[gq];B[fs]C[ph: A desaster for white. Now the game is close again.]
;W[di];B[ci];W[dj];B[eh]LB[eg:A][ff:B][dh:C]C[ph: Better at A, threatening B, or at C, which makes eyeshape.]
;W[ck];B[mo]C[ph: Good.];W[ch]
(;B[bg]LB[bh:A]C[ph: Better at A. (see var)];W[dh];B[eg];W[bh]
C[ph: Far too small.];B[ff];W[ed];B[gg]C[ph: Good];W[pm]C[ph: Again a very risky move. It is very deep in blacks influence.]
;B[qo]TR[pk]LB[nl:A]C[ph: Attack from your weak side, this is the lonely black marked stone. Perhaps attack at A.]
;W[oo]C[ph: ?];B[qm]C[ph: Good];W[pl];B[ql];W[ok];B[op]LB[oj:A]
C[ph: Not necessary i think. A move at A is going to build a moyo]
;W[pn]C[ph: With a little help by black, white as got an acceptable sabaki position inside black's influence.]
;B[qg];W[nc];B[pb]C[ph: Good securing the corner.];W[pj];B[qk]
;W[oj];B[og]LB[lc:A][ne:B][og:C][kc:D][ld:E]C[ph: I would have preferred to play at A first, and when white comes out at B, then at C. Now white can stabilize his stone easily with D or E.]
;W[kb]C[ph: A little low, but also stabilizing the white stones.]
;B[jf]LB[jb:A]C[ph: What is the value of this stone? A stone at A doesn't let white connect his 2 stones. They are still weak.]
;W[ic]C[ph: Good, taking territory calmly.];B[jj]C[ph: In the middle there is no territory. In most cases this proverb is true. It is because saving territory in the middle is very difficult, because it's open to 4 sides.]
;W[no];B[np];W[mn];B[fj];W[jh];B[ih]TR[jf][jj][fj]CR[hg][hf]
[gf][fg][fh][gh][gi][hh][hi]C[ph: Good. Black has played 3 stones and surrounded only a territory of  nearly 10 points.]
;W[jg];B[ig];W[ji];B[ii];W[kj];B[hj];W[jk]C[ph: small.];B[ne]
LB[gc:A][ld:B][kn:C]C[ph: Up to here all stones seem secure. So it's the last time to count.  white: 20 points upper left 20 points on the left side, 10 points at the top, and something in the center, total ca. 60 points.
black: 15 points lower left 25 points lower right, 20 points upper right. 10 points in the center. total secure 70 points.
So black has to play only the big sente endgame moves at A and B, then reduce the center with C.]
;W[ij];B[fn];W[lo];B[mp];W[gd];B[he];W[hd];B[qi]LB[qj:A]C[ph: Better at A.]

;W[nn]C[ph: Seems not necessary.];B[lc];W[lb];B[kp];W[ko];B[ph]
;W[hk];B[nh]LB[kq:A][io:B]C[ph: Better first at A. This threatens to cut at B.]
