C[Hi Florian,

in conclusion the main reasons why you lost this game are probably:
1. White had it a little to easy to invade and reduce the right.
2. After White's invasion on the right  you relied to much on the center instead of taking the big points on the edge of the board.
I hope that my suggestions and variations are understandable. Feel free to contact me, if you have further questions!

Best regards,
Felix a.k.a djifmaster on KGS];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[fq]LB[jp:A]C[Good move. Another idea would be around A, so it would be more difficult for White to pincer. But anything at the bottom is alright.]
;W[iq]
(;B[kq]LB[cn:B][cq:A]C[This move is not consistent with your move approaching the corner.
If you think that this move is good, because it is also an extension, then you should play the extension directly without approaching the corner.
Better to play A or B instead. See variations.];W[fp]
(;B[ip]TR[fq]C[This does not make good use of your marked black stone. See variation.]
;W[hp];B[jq]LB[io:B][jp:A]C[Usually this move should be on A. Now White could immediatly exchange B with A.]
;W[eq];B[hq];W[gq];B[ir];W[fr]
(;B[ho]C[Slow move.];W[cj]C[Good move.];B[dk]LB[fc:A][cf:B]
C[This reduction move is to early. Because the top left corner is open A or B are better.]
;W[ck]
(;B[dl]C[I favor a light approach here. See variation.];W[dj]
;B[cn]LB[fm:A]C[You have to be very careful with such a move. White could think about an attack starting with a move around A. That's why I prefer the light variation.]
;W[co];B[en];W[qo];B[qp];W[oo]
(;B[np]LB[po:A]C[I think a wedge at A would it make much more difficult for White. See variation.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[no]
(;B[mp]LB[mo:A]C[This is too soft here.
The double hane often is very effective. See variation.];W[qi]
(;B[qm]C[This move is again very soft.
You are so strong around so don't worry about fighting.];W[oj]
(;B[ok]LB[ro:A]C[This contact play only strengthens White.
You can connect your stones at any time by playing A. So you should play much more aggressive.]
;W[pl];B[pk]C[Good to connect this side.];W[ql];B[rl];W[pm]
(;B[qn]LB[rn:A]C[Better to defend the cut with a move at A.]
;W[rk];B[sm];W[pn];B[ro];W[rj]C[Now you got seperated.]
(;B[po]C[Very small move!
There is no cut or anything. Moves like this loose a game, because it basically is like passing a move.]
;W[nm]C[White got to reinforce himself.]
(;B[om]C[Vulgar style.];W[nk]C[White is very flexible here.]
;B[on];W[nj];B[nn]LB[pl:2][ql:1][pm:3][pn:4][rn:9][no:7][oo:5]
[qo:8][so:10][op:6]TR[qi][nj][oj][rj][nk][rk]SQ[rm][sn][pp]
C[This move again is very small.
White got a lot of strength (marked stones) to the top right corner. So it is urgent to defend there.

Also, looking at the result of the invasion, White can be satisfied. Allthough you added 20 more points of solid territory, White's overall position seems better. Your top right corner won't be big. So if White gets around 30 points out of his framework in the top left, it will be enough. Since White has this nice influence now, he controls the top left and it is possible for him to take the lead.]
;W[rf]C[Very big move. There is no satisfactory continuation for Black.]
;B[re]
(;W[qg]LB[qe:A]C[I think A would be much more severe. See variation.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[cc]C[Strange move, but it seems effective here.]
;B[id]LB[ic:A][lc:B]TR[nc][kd]C[Because White's shape on the top right is weak, I would prefer A. Black threatens to follow up on B.]

[ge]C[From all the moves A to D you suggested, I locally prefer C (nice tesuji) and D.
But in all variations you have to consider the marked group on the top. This group is not settled yet and therefore can be heavily attacked. So probably E or F are the moves to play.]
(;W[dg]LB[ge:1][gf:A][eh:2][fj:B][dl:3]C[White worries to much here.
He could play A to attack 1 and 2 at the same time
or
he could play B to attack 2 and 3 at the same time.];B[dh];W[ch]
;B[ej];W[gf]C[Now you see, that not defending this group hurts Black a lot.]

(;B[md]LB[lc:A]TR[ic][gd][id][ge][if]C[Actually the play at A you mentioned earlier seems very nice here (see variation).
Now it is better to play, because the marked black stones are connected to the center.]
;W[mc];B[ld];W[lc]TR[ld][md]C[Now you forced White to live and take territory. But the influence you gain is not useful now.]
