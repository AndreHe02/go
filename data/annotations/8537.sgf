AB[pd][dp][pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[jc]LB[hc:a]C[Marcus: Black has made a slight mistake here. It's not a big mistake, but Black has a weakness at A. Later, White can come back and play at A to punish Black for making too wide an extension. However ... (go to next move)]
;W[ec]LB[hc:a]C[Marcus: This move induces Black to protect the weakness at A. Black's obvious move is to extend towards the center at F16.

Also, White needs to think about the whole board here. White has two stones already in the upper left corner. White should be thinking about where else on the board to play, as there are many open areas of the board that are worth more than a third play in the same corner.]
;B[fd]LB[hc:a][cc:b]C[Marcus: This exchange has been good for Black. Black's move 6 protects the weakness at A (H17), while White still has to worry about Black taking a chance later and making an invasion at B on the 3-3 point (C17).]
;W[qf]C[thoughts on approaching top right? i figured i didn't want black to form a double-wing formation along the right, so i prioritized the right side.

Marcus: I believe approaching the upper right is the correct play on this board, and R14 is probably what I would play as well. Good Move!]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nc];W[qj]LB[qc:a]C[Marcus: This is a good exchange for you. Notice that Black has the same weakness at A (R17) that you have in your upper left corner (at C17).

Compare this to the situation where you did not play E17 (see variation) ...]
(;B[jq];W[cn]C[left side most open

Marcus: I agree. Good choice.];B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp]
;W[cl];B[fp];W[jo]C[in retrospect, i think i should have held this move in reserve. first, approach bottom right from the right, then cap when the time is right.

Marcus: I think that this move has merit. Yes, it would be good to approach the bottom right, but this move isn't bad, either.]
;B[mq];W[qn];B[pl];W[on]C[i wanted a chance to attack the pincer stone.]
;B[qp]
(;W[nl]TR[oq][np]C[i didn't know in what direction to launch the attack

i think this work, but i was premature with the cut in mopve 29. that's  my feeling, at least.

how could  i have leaned a bit on the bottom group to build up a stronger attack on the black stone? is that what i should have done. ultimately, this attack failed, and i didn't gain much in the process. i think i was too intent on killing

Marcus: Black's stones at N3 and Q4 make a Large Knight between them. This shape has two points that could be considered weak points ... one at O4 and another at P3.

If you want to try and lean on the bottom first, you might be able to use that weakness to your advantage by playing at O4. (see variation)]
;B[oj];W[pk]C[Marcus: I don't think this is a bad move. Black gets cut, which is almost always good for White.]
;B[ok];W[ol];B[ph];W[qh];B[pi];W[qi]C[Marcus: Black has forced you to make solid territory on the right now, and you are not sealed in because you have stones poking out at both O8 and Q14.]
;B[ng];W[ef]LB[jf:a][qc:b][fl:c][np:d]C[i had a somewhat strange feeling about this. i felt like the attack on black's center group was somewhat over. i couldn't find a good way to keep attacking. the move i made, however, was clearly not sente. where else should i have been looking? i considered a cap on K17 or a should hit on it, but i didn't read any great continuations.

Marcus: This move is bigger than it looks. It's nice, solid play, and I like it.

That being said, Black's center group is not quite safe yet, and Black's upper right is getting to be a little big. 

There's more than one way to continue from here, and I can't say which is best. Actually, thinking about all the possibilities is probably good for studying. 

The traditional cap or the shoulder hit on K17 feel a bit too deep. K14 (A) might be a better move, as it limits Black's growth without diving in too deep.

The invasion at R17 (B) is still open as well.

Yet another move I think might be good to think about is F8 (C), which is an important point on the boarder between White and Black.

Also, pressing down at O4 (D) and threatening to separate some of black's stones is an option.

Those are a few moves to consider, but don't throw away E14 so quickly.]
;B[no];W[fl]C[Marcus: Great move!];B[hn];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd]
;W[ne]C[me trying to attack black again. i didn't have a good plan and ended up playing mostly on neutral points. again, where should i have been looking?

Marcus: I like this move. The hard part, though, is to follow up, right? Let's look at what happens in the game ...]
;B[lf]C[this looked to loose to me];W[mg]LB[md:a]C[Marcus: Earlier you were talking about pressing on Black before attacking. Here, it seems you cut first.

I would consider pushing towards the top with N16 (A). The cut will still be there.]
;B[mf];W[nf];B[nh];W[lh];B[mj];W[kj]LB[md:a]C[Marcus: You mentioned how your opponent's move looked loose, but here you make your own knight's move and offer to be cut.]
;B[mk];W[ml];B[li]
(;W[kh]LB[ki:a]C[Marcus: This feels like a very greedy move. You offered to be cut when you played L10. Playing at L11 (A) instead might get you better profit. (See variation)]
;B[mh];W[lg];B[ki];W[jh];B[ji]TR[kj]C[Marcus: I believe this is known as "squeezing out the toothpaste". Black has pushed through your position using the weakness you made with your knight's move at L10 earlier.]
;W[kf];B[ld];W[if];B[gf];W[le];B[ke];W[me];B[kd];W[ii]C[too tight, in my opinion. the attack is already failing to a high level. black could nearly secure two eyes at O11. i think i should have been looser and expanding my left-side moyo.

Marcus: Yes, the attack is not going well. However, you don't want Black to push towards the left. I think this move may be necessary to contain Black instead of kill.]
;B[jj];W[kk];B[jk];W[kl];B[jl];W[im]C[i was too confident, i think

Marcus: However, you hit the weak point in Black's shape. That's a good thought, anyways.]

;B[ln];W[rk];B[rf]C[Marcus: Black is not safe yet, so this is a big mistake.]
;W[kn]LB[ip:a]C[Marcus: Right idea, but might be a little too soon. I might suggest playing J4 (A) first. Black should have cut you here (see my variation for Black starting at K6)]
(;B[lo];W[ni];B[pg];W[rg];B[jn]C[didn't see this coming. it looks like i may have been able to kill given black's tenukis]
;W[io];B[ko];W[ge];B[fe];W[ff];B[gg];W[he];B[se];W[hc];B[hb]
;W[gb]C[i read out the sequence incorrectly, then once i realized it, tried to milk as much out of my mistake as possible, securing the corner. somehow i got the ko out of it, and the gain in the lower left i think more than makde up for my lost stones]
;B[gc];W[ib];B[hd];W[ic];B[id];W[gd]C[Marcus: I would probably consider playing at F18 here instead. It's still sente against those 4 stones.

This is the end of the useful comments I can make on this game. You played out the rest fairly well, and you marked your misreads in the SGF.
