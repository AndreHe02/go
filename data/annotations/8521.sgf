quite often a 3 space extension can be invaded. with support on one side like b has here, it should almost always work. by peeping a b11 it just helps stregthen w.]

maisonnat [14k\]: thx bye

some istakes in the end game as you said, in total they could have been worth 20 pts or more!

need to tecognise when groups are dead, and give them up .there are ways to push near dead groups to make use of them, without loosing more stones.

good to see you tried to make centre territory and use influence, that understadning normally comes a bit later. 

much promise shown, keep practicing and you should improve.]
