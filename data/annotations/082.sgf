and asking the opponent about his real Go strength :-).];W[cd]L[pc]C
[First mistake! Entering upper-right ("A") is better.];B[cf]C[This aims at an immediate attack.]
;W[dc]L[ed]C[Lyu played at "A" in this position (check lyu-kishiko, round 2).]

(;B[de]C[Bad style, see variation "good style".];W[fd]C[This proves that d15 is bad style, cutting with e16 is bad
shape now.];B[gc];W[ed];B[jc];W[qc];B[oc]C[Attack of course!];W[pd];B[of]
C[Correct direction, since k17 is low better build up power
along the other part of the board.];W[od]
(;B[nc]C[Probably better is variation: "building".];W[nd];B[md];W[me];B
[ld];W[nf];B[og];W[qk]L[qi][ng]C[White r9 is a good move. Now black has to chose: A or B.
"A" feels slightly submissive, "B" is the game.];B[ng];W[mg];B[mh];W[lg]
;B[lh];W[kg]C[Please note that white is not alive in the corner because
of variation. That's why white has to walk here.]

submissively at "A".];W[ok];B[on];W[op];B[nl];W[mj];B[kh];W[pi]L[nh]

;B[mo];W[mq];B[lq]C[Black wants sente desperately because there are important
points in the center waiting...];W[lr];B[lp];W[kr];B[kl]C[This cut is important for obvious reasons.]
;W[kj];B[jl];W[qh]C[White suddenly changes direction. Bad choice, better keep
fighting for center power.];B[jg]C[Sente, see variation.]
(;W[le];B[qo]L[oj]C[Aiming "A".];W[ji]C[Extremely bad exchange, peeping at a cutting point is a "kyu" move.]
;B[jh];W[rp];B[oj]C[Loosing move probably, too early.];W[nk]
(;B[jn]C[The original idea of Kishiko was to play the variation.];W[nm]
;B[nn]L[lk]M[oj][nk]C[Now you see the reason why p10 was bad, white can capture
one stone, and the center aji "A" is gone for black. Now, white is
better, if black would have played k6 without the marked exchange,
black would be ok, or even better.];W[ql];B[cn]C[The largest point. The rest of the game could still have brought
black victory, but Kishiko missed some chances unfortunately.];W[bo];B[fq]
