C[blendy [19k\]: gg

B: This is the first game where I've felt both evenly matched and where I wasn't totally lost about half the time. I think I did a better job of knowing when to defend and when to tenuki than in previous games. I made a few very large mistakes in the top and top right, and I also erred by missing H3 at the end, but I'm more interested in (a) what led me to make those mistakes, especially at the top and (b) if I played well on the rest of the board or if I just got lucky against another low-ranked opponent.

I think I was playing fairly conservatively - I mostly never risked attacking white's areas, preferring to simply build territory and defend when necessary. Do you notice that? It's also possible that I've been playing wildly overextended in previous games and now I'm just playing more normally.

Thanks for your time.


Hi, blendy!
I'm shade - 8k on the DGS and 12k in real life and I will made a review of your game. I will mark my comments with *.
I'll try to make comprehencive review for black, also I'll make some comments on white moves, where I think, it was critical mistake.

I don't think you've been playing fairly conservative - you've played quite balanced in general. The main your mistake, I think,  - playing far from your stones - this helps you opponent to strenghten own position while you've been trying to connect..
Also try to don't hurry up - look through all the board before making next move.

Your 4 stones isn't safe enough, but for now there're bigger moves on the board. Extension by the side R7 (like you've played later) also good.]

(;B[pk]C[* Your stones far enough from each other - this isn't good style of playing..

If you're thinking about building moyo - then better to attack from the other side (A, B) and again corner enclosure seems good enough.
Such stones like K16 better to "push" to center and don't let creating a base (B, C).
Tenuki also playable (D and maybe E)

;W[fd]
(;B[ff]C[* Here F14 is bad because
1) it is far from bC16 and bD14;
2) now seems you're trying to create influence to center, but you don't have any stone on the bottom side!
Now you're playing too agressively, try to play more conservatively and stronger - keep all your stoner connected. Hence D14 or D17 fits better.]
