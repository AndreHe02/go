C[Hello, i played this game as black.
I think that i lost the game when i handled in a bad manner the white insavion at the move 112.
Anyway i would appreciate a general comment on the fuseki in general

KKMD: Overall, I find your fuseki good. My only general reproach would be that you play too nice. Try being more severe.]
;B[pd];W[cq];B[pq];W[cc];B[qk];W[cj];B[jp];W[nd];B[pf];W[jd]
;B[dd];W[dc];B[ed]C[KKMD: Up to this point I find your fuseki quite good. I like D16 in particular, emphasizing the bad relationship between white's san-san and its stones on the 4th line.]
;W[fb]LB[be:a][ec:b]C[KKMD: The joseki is A, but white probably disliked the idea that you could answer B. Well, the upper side is more valuable at the moment.]
;B[dg]LB[gd:a][ld:b]C[KKMD: I don't know what is the best move in this situation, but I feel yours is too nice. Since white insists on the upper side, I'd want to ask him once again with a move like A if he will continue responding there. Plus, you coud afterwards aim at B.]
;W[gd];B[fg]TR[gd]C[KKMD: Nice shape, but white had it to easy on the upper side. He must be very happy to have played the marked move in sente.]
;W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]LB[rr:a]C[KKMD: Come on! You're strong enough to attack with A, and you should definitely do that. Again, you're being too nice.]
;W[rr]LB[qm:a]C[KKMD: The standard move is A, after which white has much less problems.]
;B[rs];W[sq];B[qn]C[KKMD: Good, at least in spirit. Attack the weak group while building strong positions.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[pl];W[nn];B[lo]LB[lq:a][lp:b][mo:c][nk:d]
C[KKMD: Baaah. This is weak, you expose yourself to all kinds of nasty stuff. White will probably be able to exploit the weaknesses around A. Instead of your move, B, in the same spirit, is better; C also comes to mind as a possible improvement. I think they're not the strongest move in this situation, though, but I don't know exactly what to suggest; maybe D?]
;W[ol];B[ok];W[nk];B[oj];W[hq];B[ej]LB[ld:a]C[KKMD: I understand your wish to reduce the zone of influence of white in the lower left. Since this also strengthen your group and reinforces your central influence, it's certainly not a bad move. However, there are other hot spots on the board. White's group in the lower right is still not settled, but it's not clear how to profit from attacking it. You could start playing at A and see what happen; if white pulls its stone out, you can perform a split attack.]
;W[cn];B[fp]TR[hq]C[KKMD: This time I don't agree. There are more urgent moves, and the marked stone is in no real danger.]
;W[ho];B[en];W[fo]C[KKMD: Very crude.];B[eo];W[ep];B[dp];W[eq]
;B[do];W[dq];B[fn];W[go];B[cl];W[dk];B[dl];W[ek];B[cp]TR[cn]
C[KKMD: Letting white connect here is no big deal. It would be way better letting him save the marked stone, while eating his three-stone group. Of course the same commentary applies to your two next moves.]

;W[qc];B[pc]LB[qd:a]C[KKMD: If you're afraid of the tricks white might be able to pull up, you still have A up your sling.]
;W[rf];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[ri]
(;B[re]LB[rj:a]C[KKMD: I think white cannot live after A. Then again, I'm no tsumego-wizard, so I might be wrong. I give a variation to support my claim.]
