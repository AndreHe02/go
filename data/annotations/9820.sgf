C[In this game I played white. i will start my comment with T. This game was pretty intense when i played it. i lost by 0.5pts. I tried to first build thickness. But i Think i did 
not use it correctly because I have the feeling that i did not attack anything except the invasion stones. I would like comment on direction of play, how to use thickness and a criticsm of my yose which i think cost me a few points. Thank you very much!!!

Hi, this is Wonodan from KGS, I will be starting my comments with W. 

Feel free to send questions to my e-mail address later if you need to know more, or if I missed something. 

In case your interested, my KGS strength is around 2d-3d.];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq];W[jp]C[T: here, I did not want Kobayashi]

(;W[cq]TR[jp]C[W: To play here is a very special case, where you need to be really strong outside in order to get a favourable fight.]
;B[eo];W[do]C[T: I think pushing at E4 would have been better because of my K4 stone.

W: You can still push at E4 after Black answers this move.]
;B[dn]

(;B[cj];W[fo]C[W: This is not a good move.

It is not possible to capture this stone. 

Starting a ladder which does not work is always bad, unless you have a really good plan behind it.]

(;B[ir];W[hq];B[hr];W[gq];B[gr];W[ep]TR[cj][cn][dn][fq][gr]
[hr][ir]C[W: The result here favours White. Black failed to take the initiative (by saving the cutting stone in the ladder).

All White's stones are all connected and very strong, while Black has the two weak marked groups that are attackable.]

W: The usual strategy would have been to attack the three Black stones on the left side before he gets to defend with another move on the left side. 

It is now too late to attack the Black stones on the left side.]

(;W[dl]C[W: This move is called a "thank you" move.

You force your opponent to play a move he wants to play anyway.

The weak point in the middle of his three stones disappears, and his stones are solidly connected.]

I would have played in a different spot in this area, but he needs to reduce your center moyo.]

It is very ambitious, and if it does not work out, the game is over.]

Opening:

Don't forget the three rules when making opening moves:

1. Is there an urgent move?
- Make a base for your weak stones or attack your opponent's weak stones.

2. Is there a big move?
- Make an extension from your position, or prevent your opponent's good extension.

3. Is there a big moyo?
- Make a move that expands or closes your moyo, or prevent your opponent's moyo from expanding or closing.

Conclusion: 

Don't miss killing moves that would finish the game immediately (Move 80, 138).

(Move 80 was not an actual killing move, but it had the potential to become one as Black could not make two eyes in that area)

Don't answer your opponents gote moves (Moves 148, 238, 254).

Don't play the first move that comes to your mind, try to find a better alternative (Moves 22, 32, 40, 44, 50, 66, 84, 98, 108, 126, 186, 194, 232).]

You are also threatening the group on the bottom left side which does not have room for two eyes yet.]

(;W[ch]LB[cl:A]C[W: This is an urgent move.

It is time to attack the three Black stones on the left side, threatening to invade at A. 

This is possible because White's group at the bottom is strong (alive for sure), and Black has left such a big gap by extending quickly.

Check the three opening rules at the end of this file.];B[ej]

Again, the board favours White.]))
(;W[ip];B[hp];W[gp];B[ho];W[lp]TR[ip]C[W: Just connect with the marked stone at J4. 

Black can't really cut because White is strong in this area, and all Black would get is another weak group.

Notice how White's last move protects his two stones while at the same time threatens to close the lower Black group in. 

Moves with more than one purpose are the most strong ones.]

(;B[ep]C[W: If Black chooses to save the cutting stone (which should be obvious response), White is closed in the corner, and also needs to defend the cut at F6, leaving Black with sente.]

))
(;W[ep];B[fp];W[fo];B[en];W[go]C[W: You could consider this, since C3 meant you're going to fight an all out fight.

The aim is not to kill/capture the two stones, but rather force them to live a small live by closing in while building a wall outside.]
))
(;W[eo];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[dm]LB[cm:A][dn:B]TR[jp]C[W: This would be a popular joseki, Black would next continue at A or B. Note how you're building a wall facing your marked stone at K4.]
