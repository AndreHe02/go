C[Kentar: Hello
gunnar: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.];B[pq];W[dc];B[cp]
;W[qd]
(;B[jp]C[PM:  You both used rotating komoku, but do you know why?  K4 is too slow here.  For one thing, it's not enough to make territory, you also have to limit your opponant's territory...]

(;W[oc]
(;B[pj]C[PM:  Too loose.  White now has one secure corner and you have four weak groups.]
;W[ce];B[qm];W[eq];B[gq];W[eo];B[cn];W[cq]
(;B[bq]C[PM:  Wrong direction, see variation.  Don't give white a chance to connect!]
;W[cr];B[br];W[gr];B[hr];W[fr];B[gp];W[em];B[cl]C[PM:  White can be satisfied to keep black pushed up against the west wall.]
;W[cj]C[PM:  Overplay by white]
(;B[dk]C[PM:  Too slow, see variation];W[dj];B[ek];W[jd]
(;B[pf];W[qh]C[How should I deal with this invasion/pincer?

PM:  A better question would be how to prevent it in the first place, but here are a couple of variations.  The overarching problem is that Q10 and Q14 are slack.  Try to establish a harmony between the third-line and fourth-line stones on any given side.  Note that on the east side your stones are mostly on the fourth line, which invites third line invasions.]

(;B[ph];W[qf];B[pe];W[qe]
(;B[qg]C[PM:  Think!  You're inviting atari];W[rg];B[pg];W[qi]
;B[pi];W[qj];B[qk];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl]
(;B[rm]C[PM:  You finally contained white's reduction, and have a nice centerward wall to show for it, but white just decimated your territory, and more importantly, did it in sente (it's still white's move).  See variations for more urgent moves.]
;W[sj]C[PM:  White gave you a gift here by giving sente back to you.]
;B[pd];W[pc]
(;B[jj]C[PM:  Good thinking, but blindly playing the center isn't as good as taking into account the local shapes.]
;W[md];B[mf];W[jg];B[li];W[qq]C[Should I have been able to kill this invasion?

PM:  Yes.]
(;B[qp]C[PM:  Hane the attachment, good..but...right side?  You're forcing white to escape into the open area.  Drive white into your strong position instead.]
;W[pr]
(;B[rq]C[PM:  Too many cutting points, play more solidly.  You have the local advantage.]
;W[qr];B[oq];W[rr];B[sq];W[sr];B[rp];W[or];B[nr];W[os]C[PM:  White lives]
;B[qs]C[PM:  Waste of a move.  Linear four always lives.];W[rs]

(;B[pp];W[nq]C[This cut became a big problem.];B[np];W[mq];B[mp]
;W[mr];B[lq];W[lr];B[kq];W[kr];B[jr];W[js];B[is];W[ks]
(;B[kp]C[PM:  Unnessisary move.  Cut out moves like this and you'll gain more tempo against your opponant.]
;W[hq];B[iq];W[hp];B[ho];W[go]
(;B[hn]C[PM:  Slack.  You don't have to let white build that wall and strengthen it's southwest group.]
;W[gn];B[hm];W[gm];B[hl];W[fk];B[ej];W[dh];B[fj];W[gk];B[hk]
;W[gj]
(;B[gl]C[PM:  Rather than attacking the southwest group here, use your nice 2-stone surface area at EF-10 to spoil white's territory.]
;W[fl];B[fi];W[fh];B[gi];W[gh];B[ih];W[ig];B[hh];W[hg]C[Around this point I realized I was going to have trouble reducing the large upper territory.]
;B[le];W[ld];B[ke];W[je];B[kg];W[ji];B[ki];W[jh];B[kh];W[hj]
;B[ij];W[hi];B[ii];W[mm]C[PM:  Desperate move, although things like this DO occasionally work at ranks below 10k.  The key is to play calmly and don't let white live.]
;B[ll];W[lo]
(;B[lp]C[PM:  You didn't have to fear the cut at M4, white tricked you into wasting a move, leaving you with an overconcentrated shape.]
;W[oo];B[no];W[nn];B[pn];W[on];B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[lm];B[kn]
;W[ln];B[km];W[mo];B[ml];W[nl];B[nk];W[kl];B[kk];W[jl];B[jm]
;W[ko];B[jo];W[ok];B[nj];W[gf];B[el];W[fm]C[PM:  The shape centered around F6...you shouldn't have let white make that shape, I left a variation back at that move to show how to avoid that.]

;B[bi];W[bh];B[ah];W[bg];B[ag];W[ai];B[aj];W[af];B[bl];W[ai]
;B[ah]CR[kd][ne][fp]C[PM:  This shape is fiddling while rome burns.  There are moves left on the board that give you more points than this, the trick in the endgame is to prioritize moves in order of profitability.  Fighting over one point here or there on the edge is lower priority than, say, O15 or the other two marked points.  Also, play moves that result with you keeping sente FIRST, then you can take -all- of the relevant endgame moves.]

PM:  You need to think about the sides a little bit, take a look at some life&death problems (goproblems.com is great for this).  You let white push you around a couple of times where you could have gotten more profit by leaving the local situation alone and taking the initiative somewhere else.  Don't get hypnotized by small battles when you're on 19x19.  Remember to establish harmony between third and fourth line moves in your opening.  Some people say studying fuseki is pointless until you're at a high level of skill, but avoid building territory in the opening.  There IS no territory in the opening, only a framework, one that's likely to change by mid-game.  Keep your opponant off-guard by placing early invasions in areas that reach into the corner, leaving open the option of escaping along the side or towards the center.  If your opponant DOES completely take a corner, make sure you completely took a corner too to make up for it.  Good luck!]
