RE[W+10.5]

C[ufo: Hi, thanks for reviewing this game. The game is played with a komi of -6.5 because previous games showed my opponent is stronger. Particularly in reading. from DGS

I know that in the end bad reading is what lost me this game, but there is only so much one can do about that. The (maybe for reviewing more interesting) questions that I also had are about the opening in the left bottom. I wasn't to happy with the exchange because white seemed to have staked out a much nicer area, although they did leave weakness that I kind of exploited later. I just wonder if there are more interesting variations possible.

Secondly I have a period of trying to respect the idea that go is about living stones and not about territory, and that does help me sometimes, but often not. In this game I struggled with how to attack the two weak groups in the top. In retrospect something like the variation on move 73 would have been much better, but as I missed completely the sequence by which white connected their two weak groups, I have a hard time finding the thinking process to come to something like the variation on 73.

I left in the communication we had during the game so you can see what was going on.

Of course any other general comments are welcome.

From reading this game, I believe your approach to the game is to try to kill something to win, or invade successfully if there is nothing to kill. You made many, many small but clear mistakes here, which I think you are used to ignoring because you expect the game to be resolved by resignation, and so you rarely lose on points. As you get better and start to play stronger opponents, opportunities to kill will get fewer and fewer. This really is true. If you continue playing this style, then innevitably you will start to find your opponents manage to wriggle out alive (because they have cunningly kept their groups well enough defended), or on the occasions when you kill a group you will still lose the game because your opponent has cunningly extracted too much compensation.

You need to start attacking for profit instead of attacking for the kill.]

Ixidron: I better live now before you cut me off.

It's not that you can't read out that situation, it's just that you didn't. Go back a move from here and you can easily see that k14 works.]
;B[ie]C[ufotds: It's not like I don't practice reading or something, I just have no talent for it.

I don't know how I managed on the bottom left. Then again, you compensated more that enough on the bottom right...]
;W[je]C[Ixidron: You just have to be aware that you just need 0,5 points more than your opponent to win the game.

Of course it's a great feeling if you manage to catch a big fish and it's one of the things that make go exciting.
But by pushing my group towards the right part, you also pushed me inside your potential territory.

A proverb also says "Big groups never die" (which is not always true...). If you fail in captureing, then you also lose a lot of potential points - or you find yourself in a situation where you suddenly become the hunted.  Therefore I consider it is a better strategy to make territory WHILE attacking. E.g. you could attack from the right side and push me towards the center & make a huge mojo around q13.

However, your territory on the left side is still huge!];B[hd]
C[ufotds: well obviously I'm aware of that, but at some point one decides to go for the kill. I definitely improved my play up until now because I hold on to attack/kill strategies for to long as they become less and less feasible. however in this case I think I managed that very well. I decided to not try to make right hand side territory after trying to read out all your possibilities for escape/making eyes and I found I covered all.

In my place, would you have played any different if you had read it all out and found that the group had no way out?

Dragons don't die, but this is actually not very big though. It had two possible breach points in the middle, and to ends that might have made eyes. That should be manageable enough not to have to rely on proverbs, rather on reading.

that's why it frustrates me. I can't rely on my reading however hard I practice or try. Above a certain level that is.

One only needs 0.5 points to win, but one needs to either win or loose by quite a bit to learn I reckon.

----

No. Good players don't go for the kill. Good players attack in profit, and take kills where they can get them. It's not an either-or proposition. You don't have to gamble the whole game on a kill. You gave up too much, for example k7/k6 exchange. Don't take a loss just to strenthen your position so that you can kill a group to win the game. It just doesn't work. Attack the group, attack it well, take profit while you squeeze it into small life, and if the opportunity presents itself and you are strong enough that all you risk is letting the group live, then you can go for the kill.

You do NOT have to win or lose by quite a bit to learn. The close the game, the more game-turning mistakes there are. And every mistake is a chance to learn. You don't "learn how to win at Go" by studying why you won or lost. You learn how to analyse and play specific localized situations better by looking at your localized mistakes. And then you get better at the WHOLE game. And then you win more often. And then you play higher ranked players. And then you get more challening situations.]
;W[hc]C[Ixidron: "In my place, would you have played any different if you had read it all out and found that the group had no way out?"

In my opinion this is exactly the problem. Go is just too complicated to read everything out. It's so easy to miss a tesuji and personally I don't like it to put all one's eggs in one basket.

In case you haven't read it I can recommend Kato's "Attack and Kill" (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Katos-Attack-Kill-Kato-Masao/dp/B0006D1GOA/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1300228236&sr=1-2)]

C[The ko starting with q18 is standard. Take this as your opporunity to learn it, so that you never miss it again. Here is the lesson:

When Black is on the 4-4 point with defense on only one side, a 3-3 invasion followed by a 3-4 contact move can lead to a ko.

That said, what about q18 instead of Black q17? I don't think it works, but it's worth considering.]

When a ko like the top right develops, it is imperative that your recognise that you need to win it as soon as possible. Please, do me this exercise so that you know that you have to look at these situations differently in the future. Answer me these questions:

1. Do you think Black can live if White wins the ko?
2. Given that, how many points is the ko in the top right worth? I.e. How much better off is White if White wins it than if Black wins it. Try to be precise.
3. How big is f19. I.e. how much better off (locally) is Black playing f19, than letting White e19?
4. Given the answers to the above, which is the better move: f19 or s19?]

Ixidron: That was quite close. Without the -6.5 komi you would have won with 0,5 points (I think you have to add another stone in the s16 territory to avoid the ko).

Actually you would have won if I didn't capture your q12 group. That's why I played l18 and tried to get out in sente.
ufotds: Thanks,

It was not that close. Without the komi you would have won by 17.

I need to take more margin with situations that are difficult to read out, like the life and death situations in this game. Especially since I usually manage to come with a headstart out of the opening. On the other hand it doesn't suit my character and I think one can probably learn a bit more by pushing the limits, but it usually occurs to me when seeing a pro game how much they invest in covering their weaknesses, and probably that is for a good reason. ;)

I don't see the ko though...

thanks alot for the nice games

White: 79 territories + 43 prisoners + -6.5 komi = 115.5
Black: 69 territories + 36 prisoners = 105
Result: W+10.5

----

I think you need to take more margin with difficult situations too. If you can't read out a situation, and you push it, you are trusting to luck. You don't know what will happen, and playing it out does not even necessarily answer the question, because mistakes are made by players. It is quite normal for professional players to make a move to protect a group because they couldn't be sure it would live otherwise.

You say that it doesn't suit your character to be more careful and do more reading during the game. I say that Go is challening you to change your character, if only a little bit.]
