C[Hello Kevin ( playing black ),
It is my pleasure to share a review of this game.
0 = Answer question  
1 = Overall impression.  
2 = specific moves that I would do differently.

Thanks you in advance for doing this review.  What I am most interested in is if these huge moyos that develop in the early stages of games I play are a bad thing and what to do about it if they are.

Huge moyos will give you an advantage if they invade and fight in your area.  You have good discipline when fighting, staying at a distance and connecting stones rather than wrapping around.

Your judgement of where to extend ( 17 = J3 )  is also good, giving yourself distance back or forward.

The lower push back and forth gave your opponent solid territory, but made your moyo stronger.  However that battle was started by white, and he kinda of helped your game there.

I think the next area you need to focus on is learning how to push in one direction in order to build up a different one.  In this game the left side is an example.

Time to study how to invade and live.  Your corner invasion was great.  For an invasion to live it needs to threaten two or three things with each stone placed.  The other guy can defend only one thing.  Peeps for example, or ataris, or other forcing moves where they can defend, but you get stuff to fight or make eyes with.

The C5 invasion failed because it was too direct, every stone was right next to the other, monolithic, monotone, plodding along.  Get some team mates in there first with peeps and forcing moves

Moves like C10 will kill your chances to invade.  They force the other guy to get strong and defend himself.  Think scatter gun, think of coughing on the board in that area.  Need to keep the options open for a placed stone

Try to find threatening moves that the guy will defend, but having that stone also threatens or supports something else in the future.  Play light, keeping opportunities open.  Invasions are alot of fun.

Learning how to invade will help you know when to defend your moyo from invasion, when to let things live, even though you could kill it.  In your game you killed M4, but it cost many moves.  Maybe you could taunt more, playing at a further distance, let the guy waste two or three moves living.

Really strong players say things like "you don't need to kill it, just threaten it."  I think this is because if you attack far outside of the thing it cannot cut through, and you have big strong stuff to attack the other side.

You did well with your attacking from a distance early in the game around K4.]
;B[qp]C[

Many of the moves on both sides were direct with a single purpose.  Light moves or multi purpose moves have the intent of doing or threatening to support many future things.  A few attacks started this, where they leaned on one thing to attack something else, but in the moment of jumping on that something else it didn't quite work out.

Plays were a bit too safe and secure.  A few moves here and there were like "pass", where they weren't needed.  When you have strength to support then you can fight.]
;W[dd]C[use shift + click on the position given

46: N5  Sealing in white is important, try a more efficient move that also supports the center.

80: C11  After pushing down with some forcing moves, take profit in the opposite direction.

82: D15 Black is ahead, extend towards center and win.

147: P15  When the defense is strong enough, use a forcing move to make two moves in a row.

152 : D18  Threaten to capture stone to setup a snap back capture.

With no clear way out, just leave it  play stuff in the general area maybe, but that other stuff needs to have an alternate purpose that may also work.

A ( D15 ) game move = forcing move to form eye at D14
B ( F13 ) lighter move, but where can it go?
C ( F10 ) peep at G10, maybe gives support?
D ( F6 ) peep at G6, forcing move to get another stone in there.
