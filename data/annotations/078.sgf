(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[ Hi,

This is the game, thanks very much for agreeing to go over it.  While
I was playing, I thought my play typical, though I played quickly.

Had I taken some time, I wouldn't have played so poorly later in the
game on the lower left side.  However, my habit of quickly giving
way when I think I have lost an attack is typical, even when I take
time to actually read stuff out.  yucao was watching the game, so
some comments are directed at him via kibitz, while others ("oops"
for instance) are directed at di.

Happy Holidays!

Hi Clyde,

I concentrated on the mistakes which I think could improve your game
most once you'd correct them. Hope that I covered the questions you
had after you played the game.

Happy holidays to you too (also from Kishiko)!

C[One point strikes as especially big here: "a". It has three
meanings:

  1. ensures a base for your group;
  2. it undermines the opponents base;
  3. the territorial value is about 20 points.

In response to "a", white needs to defend the right side  (probably
with "b"). So you will  still have a chance to play d10. Also note
that "b" doesn't defend  the right side completely. Later you will
have opportunities to invade at "c" or "d".];W[rq];B[qr]L[pr][rr]C
[The shape here is "a". The reason is that white "b" is gote,
while when you move at "b" it will be semi-sente.];W[fq];B[iq]L[hq][ip]
[jq]C[This pincer doesn't exist. It's either "a", "b" or "c" in
this case. I will explain the reason shortly.];W[cq]
(;B[dq]M[dj][nd][dd][iq]C[Wrong direction. Your main force to work with is in the upper-left
(the marked stones). In the opening it's important to think really
large although it's hard to do sometimes. Take a look at the variation
to see the result and also to hear about the reason why the marked
black stone was bad shape.];W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn]M[dj]L[em][cf]C[This stone makes the marked black stone feel uncomfortable.
The marked stone would now be better placed at "a" or "b" for example.]
;B[dn]M[dj][do][dp][dq][eq][er]L[dm]C[Good! Establishing a relation between the marked stones while
building up the lower-side. Another shape to consider (same idea)
is "a".];W[cm];B[lq]L[dm][nn]C[Hmm, there is only one move here: "a". Besides, the stone
at m3 is in your own territory. In the lower-right part the keypoint
is "b", the crossline of two potential moyo's.];W[fc]L[bj]C[Correct side to approach the upper-left because the left side
is open at "a".];B[hc]C[Good spirit. The left side is not important so trying to let
white invade the upper-left and let him invest stones there is a good  strategy.]
;W[cc];B[dc]C[Good.];W[cd];B[de];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[cf];B[df]C[Same comments as for d6.]
;W[cg]
(;B[qh]C[Another idea here is in the variation diagram.];W[of];B[qk];W[rd]
C[This is not good. White looses the option to enter the (3,3)
point while the group doesn't gain by establishing a base.];B[qc];W[lc]
M[rd][qc]C[Also this move would have been more forceful without the marked
exchange.];B[me]C[Good, simple and efficient. This fight looks favourable for
black.];W[id]
(;B[hd]C[Black could get serious here with the sequence in the variation
diagram.];W[ic];B[rc]C[A keypoint, but still the sequence in the previous diagram
would be preferable.];W[he];B[gd]L[fd]C[A painful exchange. Maybe better at "a".]
;W[fb];B[ge];W[hb];B[ng]L[pg]C[Good idea but first "a" is better.];W
[ph];B[oh]L[qi][pi]C[Pity, this is an overplay, and the first real bad move by
black in this game. Normal moves instead are: "a", or "b".];W[pi];B[pg]
;W[qg];B[qi];W[og];B[nj]M[oh]L[pj]C[It's hard to keep the stones working together here due to
the marked mistake. Objectively, black is weaker than white here,
so strengthening from the right side is appropriate (with "a").];W[oj];B
[ok];W[nh]L[pk]C[Maybe better at "a" to create cutting points in black's shape.
Now black gets a very nice result.];B[pj];W[oi];B[ni];W[oh];B[mh]M[pn]
[qo][qp][rq]L[qm][rr]C[Hmm, this move has no hurry. During the sequence in the center
the white marked group has become the weak group actually. So two
moves come in mind: either "a" or "b". Personally I prefer "a" since
it strengthens your own group as well.];W[nk]C[Expectable but actually quite risky. White engages black in
 a center fight but still has the weak group in the lower right.];B[mi]
L[ol]C[Wrong. The keypoint is "a". The center stones have to take
 care of themselves.];W[ol]C[With this move white gets the better of this fight.]
;B[pk];W[rh];B[ri];W[sg]
(;B[qm]L[nl][mk][om]C[Good, keypoint for both. Alternatively, you could have captured
 ione stone with "a", "b", "c" (see variation).];W[mk]
(;B[nl]C[Hmm, suspicion cut. If you're brave you could cut like in the next diagram.]
;W[pm];B[rn];W[mm]C[This sequence shows why the cut was not good.];B[hf]
;W[ie];B[fg]L[gg][if]C[Better shape is "a", or "b".];W[nb];B[mb];W
[mc];B[ob];W[nc];B[oc];W[oe];B[od];W[mf];B[lk];W[ml];B[lf];W[nf];B[mg]L[lg]M[ng]C[White is alive so the marked stone has no value anymore. Better play "a".]
;W[le]C[This cut is severe now.];B[re];W[qe];B[rf];W[se];B[ke];W[ld];B[jg]
M[ke]L[kg][kh]C[Thin, better shape is "a" or "b". Note that you don't mind to loose the marked stone.]
;W[ea];B[km]C[Your recent moves indicate that you feel behind. But in case you feel behind you should play solid instead of thin. In every Go game you will get *another* chance. Knowing this you need to play thick to be ready to strike when the chance comes...]

Depending on the exact result you can decide whether to play "a" or
"b" next.]))
(;B[qe]L[qd][qc][rc]C[First make white heavy (while preventing white to settle
this stone with "a", "b", "c").]N[Another way to attack];W[pf];B[pi]L[qm]
C[And next keep some distance while attacking white. Also note
that this stone is high (fourth line). This will make it easier
to escape later one. When necessary you could also aim to make a base
with "a" on the right side.]))
(;B[cp]N[Bad relation];W[dq];B[ep];W[gr]M[ep][iq]L[hq][ip][fp]C
[These moves can be expected and now it's clear that the relation
between the two marked stones is bad: you don't have a move which
connects these stones. If that stone would be either "a" or "b" you
could establish the relation between the marked stones by pushing
at "c".]))
