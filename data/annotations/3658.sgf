C[Thanks in advance for the review.  I am currently a 4k after slipping in the last couple of months from a 3k.

I played white, and felt that I was leading most of the game, but that could just be a mistake.  Please tell through out the review who is leading at which points.
I have a couple of move that I thought were very costly.  Move 66 and Move 142.

Your local play is good, but you made some strategic mistakes.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]C[Usually white would play in the upper right corner here.  By approaching the lower left, you intend to make outside thickness there and do something on the right side.  This is a reasonable plan, provided you follow up.]
;B[cd];W[np]C[Good.  Build a wall facing up the side.];B[op]
;W[oo];B[nq];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp];B[id]
(;W[pg]LB[lq:D][qq:C][pl:B][pi:A]C[This extension doesn't look correct.  A is the proper distance. The problem with your move is that when black invades at A, he has room for a 3 point extension to B, to make a stable group in front of your wall.  If you hold back to A, if he invades, you can attack severely.

If your opponent responds in the corner, yo ucan make a nice framework, but that is too much to expect.

Black left the corner unfinished, so you should look to make a play at C or D.  Either should be sente, and both are big.]

(;B[pi];W[nd];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc]
(;W[pb]LB[qd:A]C[This move looks dangerous.   Playing at A is safer.]
;B[ob]
(;W[rb]LB[qe:C][nc:B][nd:A]C[This move is also dangerous.  If the stone at A were at B, then black would be forced to defend, and you ucould connect at C. I would simply connect, since it leaves you the option of escaping to the left.]
;B[pa];W[qb];B[rd]C[Very agressive.];W[oc];B[nb];W[od];B[qd]
;W[mb]
(;B[md]C[Mistake.  Black can capture the corner by playing at N17, but perhaps this move is still better.  See the continuations.]
;W[mc];B[ne];W[nc];B[pf]C[The corner fight is a success for white.  You have the corner, and a stong position facing the black framework.  Black made a wall outside, but the black stone at Q11 is too close to the wall.

On the other hand, the influence of the wall in the lower left is wasted.]
;W[pk];B[ld]C[You have to answer this move, since black is threatening to enclose you in sente.]

(;W[ec];B[lb];W[na];B[dc];W[ed];B[cf]
(;W[hc]C[This move looks strange.  Usually there would be a two point extension.  When you get so close to the black stone, you have to answer and black gets stronger.]
;B[ic];W[ef]C[At this point white has more territory, but black is thicker, and has a target to attack now.]
;B[dh];W[dg];B[cg];W[eh];B[ei];W[di];B[ch]
(;W[dj]C[This move is dangerous, since black is so thick on the upper side, and your group has no eyes yet.  I would extend toward the center.]
;B[fh];W[eg]
(;B[gi]LB[ej:B][dj:A]C[Good for black.  Black should plan to get thick here attacking the group above, then invade and attack the two weak stones A.

The solid conenction is better since it attacks group A more strongly.  Move 57 leaves behind an atari at B.

Usually you use a hanging connection to run, and a solid connection to attack.]
;W[gg]
(;B[fg]C[Pushing in like this looks wrong.  Usually you surround a group first, then reduce its eye space.]
;W[gf]
(;B[ff]C[This push is even worse, since it reduces black's liberties by one.]
;W[fe];B[hi]C[This slow move would not be needed if black had not just reduced his own liberties.]
;W[gh]LB[ej:A]C[This is not good.  You might need the atari at A later to save your two stones, and the move doesn;t help your top stones.]
;B[fi];W[jg]C[I thought that I could extend that far, but then realized that I might have trouble living, which I almost lost anyways.

Right.  This is dangerous.];B[ig];W[ih];B[hh];W[if];B[hg];W[hf]

(;B[jf];W[hd];B[de];W[ee];B[je]C[Too slow.  Usually, when you attack a weak a group and enclose it, you should take sente and use your new outside wall somehow. When you let white live with sente, you take a loss.  This move does not surround much territory, and the surounding groups are already strong, so they don't need this move for defense.]
;W[cm]C[Very good.  Black should play here first.  White is ahead, but needs to make territory in the lower left.]
;B[lq]C[Very big.  A white move here would be huge.]
(;W[qi]C[This is too small .  The lower left is the big area now.]
;B[kp]C[This move supports moves to take away the white lower left, in sente.]
;W[ln];B[cl]
(;W[dl];B[dm]
(;W[ck]C[This is a mistake.  The corner is much bigger than the two stones on the edge.  The proverb says you should extend from a crosscut, and it is true here.]
;B[cn];W[bl];B[en]
(;W[em]C[This move helps black get thicker toward the corner, and doesn't help white.  Better hold it in reserve.  The corner will need more help.]
;B[dn]
(;W[bn]C[If the white group on the edge can live, it is much more urgent to help the corner stone.]
;B[cp]LB[em:A]C[Without the move A, black would not be able to play here.]
;W[cq];B[bo]C[White took a huge loss in the lower left, and now black is ahead. White started with a nice framwork here, but now the lower left is all black, with a weak white group inside.

The black group will easily live now.];W[fq];B[an];W[bm];B[bq]
;W[iq];B[dq];W[eq];B[cr];W[jq];B[kq];W[in]C[Now white is quite a bit behind.]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[io];W[ho];B[jo];W[go];B[fm];W[el];B[fl];W[fk]
;B[gk];W[ek];B[hl];W[fn]C[Since both sides are alive, this cut is small.]
;B[er];W[eo];B[co];W[gm];B[gl];W[hm];B[il];W[pj]C[big];B[ph]
;W[qh];B[og];W[qp]C[big];B[qq];W[mj]C[big.  White makes a big territory and catches up.]
;B[li];W[lj];B[ll];W[ml];B[mm];W[lm];B[mk]
(;W[nl]C[This was a gutless move, but I thought I was still leading.  I was thinking about 'A'.  Please give me your thoughts.

I would play here also, since it defends the territory in sente. It's hard to win the ko, since black has many ko threats at the top.  But you are behind , so maybe there is no choice.]
;B[lk]
(;W[nk]C[You could try play one point higher, then jumping.]
;B[kj];W[mi];B[lh];W[mh];B[mg];W[lg];B[ki];W[qg];B[nh]C[Now I think there is no way for white to catch up.]
