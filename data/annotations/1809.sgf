C[Hi, this is my first match on IGS. Apart my big error at move number 222, I would apreciate some comment about my style of play (white)
Thanks
Other infos attached in sgf info format
PS: I reported some comment with my name before... please add yours =)

<Hi.  This is an interesting game.  I hope you find my comments worth the wait!

I think that overall you played very well.  The decision about which side to block on at move 16 was questionable, and in a couple of places you displayed a little too much concern for individual stones.  Also, it might be helpful for you to try to estimate the score once or twice duringthe game, if yuo don't do so now--it can really help in telling you what kind of plan to make. But for the most part you made the most of your opportunities.

Please feel free to email me any questions you have about the review, and remember:  if you disagree with what I say, use your own judgement!  It's much better to play moves you understand and that fit in with your plans--the worst will happen is that the opponent will give you a lesson!

LB[pj:a][qj:b][ee:c]C[I would be inclined as Black to just continue quietly building my moyo with 'a' or 'b', planning to reduce White's counter-moyo with 'c' later on.  But, splitting White's position like this can't be bad. -edgy]
;W[lc];B[gc];W[qj]C[White develops rapidly.  White's position in the upper right is thin, but it also limit's lack's expansion on the right, and a later extension from this stone can threaten Black's high shimari  (enclosure) in the lower right.]
;B[nc];W[md]TR[gc][jc]C[Thisis a good response to Black's attempt to taek advantage of White's thinness.  By building up thickness this way, White can threaten Black's marked stones later.]
;B[qc]
(;W[pc]C[White can also consider blocking on the other side (see variation). -edgy]
;B[pb];W[ob]C[Matteo: I'd preferred to block black from this side to help my two isolated stones, even if black could invade on the side

I understand this, but as you could see in the last variation those stoens are not so weak.  And there's a little problem with this line of play, that I'll discuss soon. -edgy]
;B[qb];W[oc];B[re]C[The problem is that the White stones in the upper right seem over-concentrated.  Also, compared with the earlier varaition, White has not gained much territory (always good to gain territory while attacking!). -edgy]
;W[qd]LB[qf:a]TR[qj]C[This just seems to strengthen Black's stones.  Maybe White should press Black down with 'a', building thickness and reaching out towrdas the marked stone. -edgy]
;B[rd];W[qe]LB[qf:a]C[This is much too timid.  'a' is needed, although it puts less pressure on Black than it would have last move. -edgy]
;B[qf];W[pf];B[qg];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph]LB[pi:a]C[Maybe 'a' is better?  This looks very good for Black, anyway.]
;B[kb]C[White has gained thickness in the center, but what can it be used for?  The proverb is 'use thickness to attack', and the only obvious thing to attack here is the Black group on the upper side.  So Black strengthens it. -edgy]
;W[lb];B[fb]C[And again. -edgy];W[cn];B[gp]LB[fp:a]C[I thnik I like 'a' a little better; this is maybe a little thin. -edgy]
;W[qm];B[qn];W[ke]TR[qn][qm]LB[pm:a]C[Matteo: I would like to use the big wall on the side to build a moyo.

<"Center territory is always smaller than it appears."  But, there's not a lot else for White to try here.  Perhaps White could invade the lower side.

I'm a little concerned about the exchange of the marked stones.  Since White hasn't played 'a', Black gets to do so. -edgy>]
;B[pm]C[Strong move.  Pressures White's stone, builds Black's lower-side moyo, and start to counter Whites' central influence. -edgy]
;W[ql];B[je]LB[nm:a]C[There was no hurry to do this, since Black can secure that group by either jumping into the corner at d18, or by moving into the center.  IF Black took time now to play 'a', he would greatly expand his lower side and greatly reduce White's central prospects.  It is very hard to see how White could play for a win then. -edgy]
;W[gf];B[he]TR[je]C[I think this just helps White build up. o7 is still very strong. -edgy]
;W[ge];B[hd];W[fd]C[Now suddenly White has a nice left-side moyo, and the black upper-sdie group is really no safer than before.  I think Black is still a little better, sicne he should still be able to expand his lower-side territory while eating into White's center. -eddy]
;B[eb];W[db]C[This might be too slow.  Black's group seems pretty safe after his last move, and it might be bigger to play something like p9, starting to surruond the center and gettingready to reduce the lower side. -edgy]
;B[dj]LB[nm:a]C[Matteo: I suffered this move a lot. I would like to extend from these stone to build big territory on the side

<It is a big move, though slightly risky.  Black could still play around 'a', expanding his territory and leaving this or a jump into the center for later. -edgy>]
;W[cj];B[di];W[en]LB[fp:a]TR[gp]C[Interesting move.  Because Black's marked stone is not at 'a', thsi makes Blacks lower-left a little insecure, and indirectly attcks black's left-side group. -edgy]
;B[ci];W[cg];B[dk];W[cl];B[gj];W[cp]C[Black hurries to secure that right-side group, and White uses sente to attack the lower-left.  Thisis the right idea, but I wonder if a 3-3 invasion, or even somethnig strange like e3, might have caused Black more trouble. -edgy]
;B[cq];W[do]C[Maybe White should consider a cross-cut at d3 to complicate things.  This is 'safer', but gives Black breathing-space to make his lower left more solid. -edgy]
;B[ep];W[bp]LB[ij:a]C[Seems slow.  Maybe White should try a play around tengen or 'a', harassing the Black left-side stones and expanding the White center. -edgy]
;B[fo]LB[ij:a]C[Also seems slow.A further jump by the black left-side group to 'a' looks good, or even once again a move around o7. -edgy]
;W[kg]LB[kg:A][gm:B][ij:a][jj:b]C[Matteo: I have difficulties deciding which move between A or B

<Well, 'A' has the virtue of at least making a little territory in the center, though I think 'a' or 'b' do that while putting more pressure on the Black group.  'B' doesn't make any territory, and in fact encourages Black to jump into the center, so that can't be right. -edgy>]
;B[jf];W[kf]C[Too slow.  White should jump into the center again. -edgy]
;B[hg];W[hf];B[if];W[ig];B[ih];W[gg]LB[jg:a]C[No good. 'a' would at least keep Black's groups separated. -edgy]
;B[jg];W[hh];B[ig];W[ki];B[hi];W[gh];B[ij]C[Matteo: Black is making no points while white does

<Yes, but Black no longer has any weak groups, either, and it seems to me that the balance of territory favors Black. -edgy>]

[ps][nr][ns][mr][ms][lr][ls][kr][ks]LB[nm:a][lq:b][mq:c]C[Let's try to estimate the score.  I've tried to mark out what territory each side has.  Assuming I'm right:

White, about 65, plus anything extra he can get in the center.
Black: about 75, plus anything extra he can get in the lower-right.

Black is ahead by 10, and it's his move.

This tells us what Black and White should be doing:  Black should play quietly.  He doesn't need to fight.  If Black either expands his lower-side territory or succeeds in reducing White's central expansion, he wins.  It's his move, and he has a move 'a' (o7) which helps _both_ of his aims.    White is behind.  He can't affor to play quietly, and must instead unbalance the game.  he may need to do something desperate, like invadingthe lower side.  Such an invasion should probably die, but if it lives, it restores the balance.  So, White's last move shuold probably have been an invasion around 'b' or 'c'.

-edgy];B[fn]C[By my comment in the previous move, I thnik this is wrong.  It maybe expands Black's left-central area, but it does nothing to White's center or to strengthen the lower side.  Either o7 or the very quiet n4 were better. -edgy]
;W[kk]C[OK, this improves White's center a little and maybe prepares to jump into the lower side.  But maybe White should just invade immediately.]
;B[lj]C[Vary bad move!  There's no reason for Black to play such a risk move, when a quiet move like o7 or n4 should just win. -edgy]
;W[kj];B[mk];W[ol]TR[lj][mk]C[Very good.  White plays to surround the weak Black stones, and also prepares a jump into the lower side.  -edgy]
;B[pl];W[pk];B[mm]C[I think o7 was more solid, or p7. -edgy]
;W[om];B[pn]C[I don't like this.  p7 solidifies Black's position better.  White wuodl still have caught up some, but he'd still haev to successfully invade to win--very hard.  This wastes a move to save two miserable stones. -edgy]
;W[ml]
(;B[ll]C[Maybe  Black should just play o6 here (see variation). -edgy]
;W[nl]C[White o6 followed by jumping into the lower side, seems better. -edgy]

(;B[lm]LB[lk:A]C[Matteo: I've not understood why black didn't connect at A

<Perhaps he finally figured out that he should just try to consolidate.  See variation. -edgy>]
;W[lk];B[mj]C[Nonsense.  After 'a' (o6) Black still has good hope of victory.  -edgy]

(;W[oj]C[Also nonsense.  After o6 White is turning the  tables. See variation. -edgy]
;B[jl]C[Black can mayeb make a little territory in the left-center after this, but o6 must be bigger.  -edgy]
;W[fj]C[o6 for White us still quite annoying to Black here.]
;B[fk];W[ej];B[ek]LB[kq:A][lq:B][mq:C]C[Matteo: Now there is some space on the bottom of the board. I reduced with continuous extension from my live group. But maybe is possible an invasion at A,B or C?

<It may be possible to invade at 'B' or 'C'. -edgy>]

;B[np];W[mo];B[mp];W[lo];B[jn]TR[ek][fk]LB[el:a][gl:b]C[This, on the other hand, has gobe pretty well.  White would be in better shape, though, if he hadn't forced Black to play the marked stones, since they actually help make territory for Black.  Without those moves, White could try something like 'a', attackingthe Black group and preparing  'b', breaking into the Black center area. -edgy]
;W[kn]LB[kp:a][lp:b]C[I kind of like 'a' or 'b' instead. -edgy]
