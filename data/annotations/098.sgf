(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[White got behind
early by making two mistakes in the direction of play.

Black kept white in the game by misplaying the lower left corner and failing
to continue attacking white's invasion of the lower right.

White did not make effective use of his attacking potential on the one weak
black group in the center right.

Ordinarily, this would mean that white would lose...

But Black self-destructed in handling the invalid white invasion on the top
right.

White has good hand-to-hand fighting skill. He needs to supplement this with
greater global
vision.]US[Brought to you by IGS]GN[girodias-fursa]RE[W+Resign]PW[girodias]

(g3) is small - seems like a reflexive reaction to black's last move.

b (d10) virtually forces black into the upper left corner.

Your strategy is to pressure the invasion making territory naturally at the
top and left.]

3 lower left stones are inefficient because the corner is still invadable.

(;B[qk];W[om];B[nk]C[b (n7) is a huge point for
both sides.

If b gets it you have to live in gote and black gets overwhelming thickness.

Your move is small for two reasons. Black is underneath you at the top left,
and if b follows up n15 with n17, you can jump in the corner.]
