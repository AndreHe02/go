AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[**General comments about the game:

I am playing black.  The game ended in black's favor due to time, but I think the board was fairy settled by that time....I've edited out most of the comments since this game was very chatty.  Comments added by myself after the game are preceded by two asterisks (**).

I would like advice on how to attack.  My opponent commented that I was very passive in this game, and I agree.  All my moves were responses to ones made by my opponent.

My igo background - I've been going to weekly "classes" for half a year, by my teacher speaks Japanese and I don't, so there has been some problems communicating.  I have also been a sporadic attender.  I started from absolute beginner when going to the classes.

Total games with human opponents - probably less than 20.  Most of the time I play my teacher.

General areas for improvement beyond this game would be much appreciated :).

Thank you!

laurellias [18k?\]: Not sure, between 15 and 20 I think.
lisbon [9k\]: 9 stones is a lot];B[oh]C[**P12 was meant to stop the two white stones from connecting.  Would it have been better to play elsewhere (ie. the left of the board?)]
;W[oi];B[pi]C[**Unsure of this move is appropriate];W[lp]C[lisbon [9k\]: difficult to play
laurellias [18k?\]: I'm really bad so I'm not sure how much the 9 stones will help me...]
;B[ln];W[mo]LB[mr:A]TR[ql][nn][pn][lp]C[**Moves 15 to 35 - very bad moves by me.  Not only did black lose all the stones played, black also aided white in building a very thick wall to the right.  Would it have been better to continue building frameworks elsewhere, or was it appropriate to enter a local fight now?  Also, what can black have done to reduce losses?


lisbon [9k\]: until now u made the right moves
lisbon [9k\]: how long been playing?

cayol :lisbon is right. N2 is not a good move, because your group is in danger. White is threatening your group. You can counterattack because White is not so strong : he has no eyes.]

laurellias [18k?\]: I've been going to a go center for lessons once a week for approx. half a year.  But I haven't been able to absorb a lot since it's in Japanese ;p and I skip lessons.  Also, have played about 15 games against human opponents.]

I also miscalculated and thought the group in the lower right was live though territory is obviously miniscule.  (Did not notice Q4 is in atari until larer).



lisbon [9k\]: is that so?
lisbon [9k\]: oh
lisbon [9k\]: I missed the time
laurellias [18k?\]: Ah, is it possible to continue?
lisbon [9k\]: unfortunately not
lisbon [9k\]: u have a good territory in the center
laurellias [18k?\]: I was told recently that in a handicap game I should use black's influence stones to work towards the center...
lisbon [9k\]: u lost all the corners though
laurellias [18k?\]: Nods
lisbon [9k\]: actually u should ude the H stones to attack
lisbon [9k\]: use
lisbon [9k\]: oterwise ur playing is good
laurellias [18k?\]: Should I have attacked more?
lisbon [9k\]: yes
lisbon [9k\]: a littlr too passive
laurellias [18k?\]: I think so too, but every time I try to attack I tend to commit suicide.
lisbon [9k\]: u must not overplay

cayol : You made a nice territory in the center.  But white didn't play very well. He let you do it.]
