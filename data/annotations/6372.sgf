;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[ed]C[-----------
This is great. I like that you chose the more aggressive approach. Pins down white's side acting like a cap, and aims to take over the board in a big way. It's a shame white's side got away like it did.]
;W[qf]TR[qh][qi][qj]C[-----------
Any of these points is a fine place to pincer. O16 is steady but feels out of tune with your overall setup. Keep in mind that any 3-4 stone is begging for an enclosure or stone to pincer. Going there now is both an enclosure -and- a pincer, which puts great pressure on white; who now has to escape while figuring out a way to keep you from extending or sealing that area further.]

(;B[nd];W[dc];B[qo]C[MaTo: I propably should have left the corner without a closure for now and play on the left side or made a pincer around r10 or r10?

-----------
Definitely now if not earlier. With the O16 stone in place, a pincer is even more devastating, slamming white against a more fortified spot and slightly reducing his chances in the corner.]
;W[fq]
(;B[qe]C[MaTo: At least at this time is hould have played instead on the left side c10 or d10 or if i wanted to give a bit of pressure for that stone i should've played r10

-----------
Right. This is the wrong direction. Last chance for a pincer. If you really want to play here, try for R16, R15 is not as solid and only encourages white to reinforce, as well as leaving an invasion in the corner still.]
;W[qj]
(;B[pf]TR[nd][pd][qe]C[MaTo: and again at this point i should've played on the left side

-----------
Left side is indeed bigger. But this is not only bad timing, but the wrong direction. These stones are all really cramped and not adding much to each others' power. If you must play here now, go to S14 and undercut white's eye space and even out the balance in this corner.]

This and R13 are small, it's your chance to move against the left side or on the bottom. White can't gain much here compared to what can be gained by filling out the rest of the board.]
;W[dj]C[MaTo:  and now i lost the chance];B[df];W[cf]
(;B[jp]TR[jo][jq]C[MaTo: Maybe i should have done a bit smaller of an extension because of the white strong position on the right side since the invasion is almost too easy.

-----------
Maybe tack this one a line lower. Remember that it's good to build box-like frameworks. Pulling back though allows white a good second extension along the side, though, so it's a tradeoff for the invasion.]

;B[hq]C[MaTo: At this point i was aimint at and invasion of d7 but it got sealed right before i could do it.

-----------
Instead of this it may be a good idea to invade the left outright. It's only natural for white to respond to this by filling in his last gap, but your group has room to run and can probably get an eye on the bottom side at the moment. It's a balancing act, but it becomes incredibly hard to invade after wD7.]
;W[dm];B[cq]C[MaTo: Propably a mistake as the white wall resulting from this gave too good chances for developing to the center]

This works to live, but in this situation, B3 is much better because it is sente due to the impact it can have on white's left side while still creating a living shape.]

Too small, be careful of moves like this. It's worth only two points and doesn't change the living status of your group.]

(;B[in]C[MaTo: Maybe i should have connected at j7 but i dont think that it has a very big effect

-----------
Connecting doesn't make any territory, but the following sequence ends with black just throwing away stones.  Not good if you don't have a plan or reason for doing so. You don't gain anything from connecting, but white gets a few free points while you throw stones at him.]

MaTo: All in all I was being dominated in the early game and the only reason the game got pretty close was that he let me kill his s17 group

-----------
Overall you did well, but you seemed to notice a lot of important moves then delay them anyways. Don't get too caught up in fights. Stop every so often and really think, "Do I really need to keep playing here? Is there something bigger?", and use your strong stones to accomplish that goal. Work on studying invasions and a little fuseki, especially. You seem to have good reading skills for your level, you just have to apply that to your opening, too. Good luck, I hope I covered all the major points in the game and that this helps you out some.]

(;B[cj]C[-----------
There are a ton of ways this can go depending on where you choose to invade and white's response of course, but in most any case the same effect is gotten: Break up white's chances at a giant framework. Somewhere near the middle of this side is recommended so that you can jump away from the side white approaches on, to give you wiggling room to stay safe.]

If white moves to defend this group then you get to uproot the group, secure some territory, and sente remains to make your move on the left side. A and B are the most hampering on white's left continuing from the top, C is possible if you really want to emphasize the top.]

Surrounding white's stone on the far side on a larger scale. A pincer would still be great to remove white's maneuverability but this starts to erase wriggling towards the center while reducing white's left.]

(;B[qd];W[qi];B[qk]C[-----------
This isn't as obviously good for black as the outright pincer, but the indirect pressure on white is nice and you have a good bit of fairly secure territory on the top and lower right sides.
