C[Pedja [3k\]: Hi
arcin [3k\]: hi, have a good game

Hi Arcin,

I will be reviewing your game.  My comments are prefixed [Frank\].  Hope it helps.

;W[np]C[[Frank\]Q6 is not a bad choice of joseki at this point, but I think you should definitely follow through.  See variation.]

(;B[nn];W[qn]C[[Frank\]B is punished here.];B[qm];W[qo];B[rm]
;W[rn]C[[Frank\]W returns the favor.  This move is endgame.]
;B[lp]TR[fc][mc][nc]C[[Frank\]I would have personally played on the top.  That seems to be your biggest area for development.  I wouldn't mind any of the marked moves, though a shimari on the top right would be my preference.  The move you played in the game is a little early in my opinion.  Even if you played away, W will not spend a move there.  If he did, it would be almost as bad as S6]
;W[lo]C[[Frank\]Though you certainly found a way to live here, you did have the option to go to the center.  See variation.]

;W[ho]C[[Frank\]It's funny that you got the cut AND lived in sente here....That said though, I still think the variation at move 18 is better.  You typically want to try to escape first before living in a confined space.  W should have forced you to live in gote.]
;B[nc];W[qf]
(;B[qh];W[of];B[qd];W[re];B[rg];W[rc]C[I should prevented this i guess.]

(;B[pf]C[[Frank\]This seems like a mistake.  See variation.]
;W[pg];B[pe];W[qg];B[og];W[oh];B[ng];W[ph];B[qi];W[ni];B[nf]
;W[pb]TR[rd]C[after this move, he was basically alive...

[Frank\]He probably has only one eye in that corner.  You should keep that in mind, though you are right in that it may not be the proper time to play in this area (after you play your sente - the marked move).]
;B[fd];W[hd];B[jc];W[df];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[gd];B[fc];W[gc]
;B[gb];W[fe];B[eb]TR[ee]C[I wanted to make my shape solid. that's why i didn't go D17, etc. I also thought i had a good cut at E15.

[Frank\]Good move.];W[db]C[[Frank\]The corner is not taken yet.]

(;B[ch]C[was the proper move? should I be just extending from my corner? but then he would extend from his.....

[Frank\]I think so, but maybe C11 is better since it would be harder to effectively pincer you.  Keep in mind that you still have C18 to destroy that corner territory.  See variation.]

(;B[bq]TR[cc][ce][ch][ci]C[This definitely didn't go well for me. lost all my territory afterwards lost the 2 marked stones.

[Frank\]You can still take out his corner territory in the top left.  See variation.]

;W[de];B[ef];W[ed];B[ff]C[I don't know why he let me cut all the way like this. But this was the beginning of the end for him.

[Frank\]Lots of corner aji he must take care of.];W[ge];B[fh]
;W[ck];B[dl];W[dj];B[hg];W[di]
(;B[nj]C[I basically ignore his last 2 moves and went for  the center. Actually this last move is wrong direction.]
;W[mi];B[lh];W[mj];B[nk];W[rf];B[kj]C[He played into my plan. his moves were too slow. Basically I want comments "before" this point. Still, please look at the game till the end. If there are bad decisions in the endgame  that would also be helpful.

Thanks.

[Frank\]In summary, I think W lost for two reasons: he played many small moves, and he left too much aji everywhere that resulted in a death.  That said, I think you could have taken better advantage of his bad aji.  Your game was solid, but at some points you need to assert the situation a bit better and perhaps apply some fundamentals.  An example would be the L4 group, you should connect your group by going to the center, and disconnect his.  Also O4 stressed the center before the corner, so W took a good amount of territory there.

Anyway, this is the last comment.  Hope it helped.];W[rh];B[ri]
