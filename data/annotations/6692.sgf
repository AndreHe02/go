C[wakka [-\]: hello gg


erker: Hello wakka!
I will do the review. I hope you enjoy it.

This game is about thickness ( = a strong, powerful formation that is not easy to attack).
For a weaker player, the value of thickness is difficult to understand -- especially how to use own thickness. But as a first step it's enough to not give thickness to the opponent for free, because he will know how to use it. 

Please read my summary at the end (move 224) before continuing with the discussion of the game.]

;W[cp]LB[dn:A][co:B][cq:C]TR[ep]C[wakka [-\]: what are some ways i should approach this?


erker: The white stone (c4) is one usual approach move to the marked black stone. A, B and C are the common responses.]

(;B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[cn]LB[bn:B][bp:A]C[erker: At this point Black can decide weather to get outward influence or the corner.
The important thing to remember is to cut at the side you don't want: at A to get the outside, at B to get the corner. The reason is that White will capture the cutting stone, as not doing so will result in an inferior position]

(;B[cq]LB[bn:A]C[erker: As shown in the variation, if you want to keep the corner, the correct way is to play at A.]

LB[cc:A][fe:B]C[wakka [-\]: some variations on how to handle this mabey.


erker: Black can attach at A or jump to B.

The attachment at A results in a similar constellation as the one in the game (Black lives on the side, White get outside influence), but with much better shape.
But usually, Black don't want to help White in building outward influence, so jumping to B prevents this and leads to a fight.]

;B[bg];W[bh];B[pc]LB[cc:E][kc:A][de:B][fe:D][dg:C]TR[qe]C[erker: Good move. Next you can aim to play an extension to A; that would also reduce the influence of the thick white wall on the left.

But it's White's turn, so White will definitely play an extension as far as possible from his thickness on the left.

That is the reason why I don't like your approach move at B: after the white pincer (C) the jump to D is ineffective because of the strong white position in the lower left. And after E (or the sequence in the game) White get a thick position. Now Black needs two moves in a row: enclose the corner and counter the thickness with an extension.

Compare this position with the variation for move 29.];W[be]
;B[bf];W[lc]
(;B[ic]LB[kd:A]TR[lc][ef]C[wakka [-\]: is there a better way to reduce white than this?  if so please show variations


erker: First of all: your move is _not_ a reduction, it's an invasion. This distinction is not just a play with words, it has tactical and strategic consequences.
An invading stone fights from inside the (potential) territory, it will be attacked, it has to make life or run into the open. In contrast, a reducing stone presses from the outside, the opponent has to defend.

Strategically, a reduction destroys less potential territory than a invasion, but the opponent can gain thickness by attacking the invading forces. 
This is the reason why weak players fear invasions, they only see their territory vanish. But strong players enjoy being invaded because of the thickness they get in exchange for territory.

So invasions have tactical problems (to not get killed) and strategic problems (to not help your opponent).

Why is your stone an invasion? As a rule of thumb, connect the stones at the border of the potential territory (the two marked white stones in this case). If you're beyond this line, your opponent will most likely press from the outside, so your stone end as an invasion. 

As White is strong in this area of the board and you're not, it's better to play a reduction (at A, stopping short before the border line). Regardless of White's answer, you can't get a bad result.]

erker: Blocking at A is the obvious move, but it helps White to encircle the center (see variation). The marked black stone is clearly out of place]

;B[le]SQ[kf][kg][lh][li]C[erker: As long as this is a forcing move, it's OK.
But don't try to live locally! Run into the open instead.

Why is running better than living? Assume the black group manages to live and White gets stones on the marked fields. The game would be over.]

erker: Jumping to A, forcing White to play B only helps White, as White wants to play there anyway (connecting the white stone with it's friends).
Therefore, I prefer C -- it pushes White in the direction there Black is strong.]

Summary: White won this game, because the use of thickness.

White got some thickness in the lower left corner (A), used this thickness to attack your stone in the upper left corner (B). This resulted in thickness (C), which White used to attack your invasion (D) to create more thickness (E). This thickness allowed White to harm your formation on the right (F), to get more thickness (G), and  to attack your running group (H). Again, this resulted in thickness (I). Backed up by this strength (G, I), White was able to successfully invade your bottom formation (J) with K.

Some remarks about thickness:

1. White correctly used thickness to attack, not to gain territory. The points White gained on the left, the center, and the lower right center are just side effects of the attacks.

2. Thickness results in thickness. From A to C to E to G.

3. The goal of thickness is to attack, not to kill. White is perfectly happy that Black managed to live in the upper left corner (B), the top (D) and the upper right corner (F). The death of your running group (H) was just an accident. Even without killing H, White would have won by a large margin.

Ways to improve:

1. If faced with the decision to live small and got shut in or to run away into the center, running into the center is usually better. (Don't help your opponent to gain thickness.)

2. An invasion usually results in thickness for your opponent. If this thickness will hurt you more than the invasion hurts your opponent, don't invade -- just lightly reduce from the outside.

3. Don't help your opponent. (Don't play a move just because your opponent must answer.)]
