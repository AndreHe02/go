C[I am playing Black.

==============

k: You need to write yourself a post-it note and stick it on your monitor. Read the post-it everytime you begin a game. Write on the post-it: 

"If there are big areas in the corner or on the sides that are open, THEN PLAY THERE. If your opponent threatens one or two or three stones that are not important, then IGNORE it. Force yourself to do this. Always ignore it."]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[qd];W[co];B[oc];W[jq];B[qj]TR[qd][oc]LB[qj:a]
C[Reasonably sensible opening I think.

K: Yes, I agree. A is a good extension from your corner enclosure :)]
;W[jn]C[White starts to do a rather unusual sequence here.]
;B[dj];W[jj];B[jd]C[k: I think black looks much better here.]
;W[il]C[Is playing the centre like that a good idea generally?

k: Not exactly. I can't really see the purpose behind white's moves.]
;B[hk]C[k: This is your first "bad" move, I think. You should just ignore his crazy-centre playing, and strengthen your own territory by, for example, taking the sides/enclosing the corners.]
;W[hl];B[gk]LB[cq:a][dq:b][qn:c]C[k: Corner approaches at A, B or C are much better moves.]
;W[gl]C[k: Your moves here are just helping white build a large moyo, while doing nothing for yourself.]
;B[ep];W[gp]LB[ep:a][cq:b][dq:c]C[Trying to reduce W control of the corner and hopefully lead back to the left middle.

K: I'm not sure what you mean by "lead back". Because you played at A rather than B or C, you must escape to the centre instead of making life.]
;B[eo]LB[en:a][cp:b][cq:c]C[k: This is too slow. You need to make a one stone jump at A instead, if you want to escape, or play at B or C to make life in the corner.]
;W[en];B[fn]C[I try to join up and cut as much as I can here.

K: I would have hane'd in the opposite direction.];W[dn]LB[fm:a]

(;B[fl];W[fm];B[em];W[gm]LB[fo:a]C[Although it didn't really work.

K: you still would've had a cut at A anyway. Better to just make the stones live in the corner.]
;B[cn]LB[ek:a]C[A dodgy move I always seem to play without thinking.

k: This is definitely a dodgy move. Playing at "A" is essential.]
;W[cm];B[bn];W[fk];B[dm];W[dl];B[do]C[Lucky for me there.

k: Very :)];W[el];B[cl];W[bm];B[bl];W[bo];B[bp]C[Mistake by B]
;W[cp];B[cq]C[Mistake made worse, because it allows for the next move.]
;W[bq]
(;B[am];W[dq];B[cr];W[dr];B[br];W[ap];B[an];W[cs]C[B - I start trying to save the corner.]

K: holy god... Black has now won the game.];W[gj];B[ik]LB[qn:a]

C[
K: All these moves have been completely random. You are fighting over 1-3 stones and non-territory.....]
;W[ir];B[gs];W[is];B[hs]LB[hs:a][qn:b]C[
K: for example, which move was bigger -- A or B? It is hard for me to "review" these moves.]
;W[kl];B[pl];W[qn]LB[ql:a][on:b]C[
K: Blocking at A is tiny. extend further in at B to reduce his territory area.]
;B[ql]C[Here starts some rather messy and unsuccessful playing by me.]
;W[on];B[nm];W[om];B[ol];W[nl];B[mm];W[ml];B[ll];W[lm]C[My attempt to cut ends up with me getting cut a lot worse.]
;B[lk];W[mj]
(;B[ln];W[km]C[A pointless atari that allowed him to connect.]
;B[mo];W[nj]TR[mo][ln][mm][nm][ll][lk]LB[qg:a]C[
K: at this point you are completely dead and anything you do with them now will just hurt you. You need to fall back and play something like A.]
;B[lj];W[li];B[mq];W[lo];B[mn];W[mp]LB[nm:a]C[I keep doing 1 step jumps and then forgetting to connect. And I always get punished for it...

K: that's not what you are being punished for, you are being punished for trying to save A in the first place.]
;B[np];W[lp];B[no];W[nq];B[oq];W[nr];B[mr];W[or];B[op]C[My ugly shape looked dead to me by now.]

K: why?];W[os];B[ms]C[
K: why?];W[ks];B[pr];W[oo];B[ni]LB[ni:a][oh:b][pg:c]C[I realise I've messed up and start to retreat, I don't know quite how or why my invasion went so badly.

K: this is not retreating. This is clinging to a powerful structure. If you cling to them you are going to get lost. Instead of A, do you see how B or C might be better? "Retreat" is not synonymous with "run up and hug the enemy" :)]
