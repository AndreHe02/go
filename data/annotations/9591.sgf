(;B[jj]C[jender: This move looks a little strange. It is not consistent with J17. With J17 you were going for territory and now you're going for influence...]

;W[rg]C[Probably I should have blocked at something like S15?

jender: Yes, white is inside your sphere of influence. Separate it from the alive white group and it will die it all or at least live small.]

(;B[ej]C[Probably it wasn't a good move but I don't know where I should have played instead.

jender: Yes, It doesn't look good. If you want to make your moyo bigger you should play at G14.]
;W[ci];B[gp]C[I tried to create some territory in the middle and push my enemy to the sides but maybe it would be better to play F3 and invade the corner?

jender: Yes, F3 is more usual. But the easiest is to invade directly at C3. That is good because of the long extensions.]
;W[eq]
(;B[eo]C[jender: You don't gain much with this, actually you are helping white to make territory and losing the opportunity to invade the corner or somewhere around C6 in the future. And the influence you create is neutralized by K4.]

(;B[hp];W[gq]C[jender: You gained little and helped white to make territory.]
;B[jo];W[mm]
(;B[mn]C[jender: This is too greedy. Your position is not so strong to try to kill this stone. K5 is weak because there is an attachment that hasn't been answered, and the lower right corner also has weaknesses. White could invade around R3 in the future.]
;W[nn];B[ln];W[ip];B[io]C[I though I was leading because I had a nice wall in the upper right corner, the lower right corner, and huge potential territory in the middle but now it started to get worse.

jender: It looks quite even. White has a lot of territory and  your moyo has a weakness around Q13. You have also the weakness around R3.]
