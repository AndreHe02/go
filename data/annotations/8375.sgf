C[//Hi, I'm your reviewer.  I go by Firadin on KGS (I'm not on too often, so if you have questions its probably better to email me at ashrestha1994@gmail.com).  For future reference, when you send in a review please put in comments into the game with specific questions about what you are confused about; it makes my job easier.]

(;W[gg];B[hf]C[//this might be good for white, but it gives black a very high top.  White needs to reduce, but also needs to extend the right to make the height gained from this trade as significant as possible.  Without succeeding in those endeavours, black is gaining something like 9 points here whereas white is gaining maybe 6 maximum.  If black can extend top around N15, he is gaining much much more (around 15).]

(;B[iq]C[/better choice is to enclose the bottom with a low Chinese fuseki.  Otherwise the approach at E3 or E4 leaves the C4 stone weaker than you might like (certainly not *weak* just weaker)]
