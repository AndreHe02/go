C[Haze: Hi! Thank you in advance for taking the time to review my game, I really appreciate it :)
I lost that game very high (24 points I think).. I knew that I was losing, but I didn't think it would be more than 10 points. I was really surprised. And I don't really know where I went wrong but I'm pretty sure my mistakes lay in the opening/early middle stage. Maybe I created too many groups? But I couldn't think of a good way to make territory :/

Jared: Hi!  First, good for you for submitting a game for review.  It takes courage to ask someone to point out your mistakes.  Anyway, I have a few comments and suggestions (mostly for black, but a couple for white as well), and hopefully you'll get something out of it.  Throughout the game, my comments will be marked with a J.  I'll give you a brief synopsis of my comments right here, though.

I noticed a few ideas coming up multiple times as I looked over your game.
(1).  Be careful not to play unnecessary moves.  Each one gives your opponent a "free" move, and you fall behind.  This involves more reading.  (Example: "If I don't play here, then white can try attacking, but I can defend and live, and therefore I don't need another move in this area.")
(2).  Feel out the "flow" of the stones.  This is a little hard to understand, but I recommend reading Kageyama's "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go."  I think there's a .pdf version online somewhere.  In particular, read the chapter on The Stones Go Walking, but the whole book will work wonders for improving your game.
(3).  In regard to the question of how to make territory: make territory while attacking your opponent!  A good example is the variation (P13) at move 9.

The outline of my comments for this game:
(1).  Black made a few errors in the sequence from moves 10-23.
(2).  Black really should have had sente after this exchange, but white somehow had the initiative at move 24 to make a big move.
(3).  After that black is playing catchup, and a few more mistakes (25, 29, 33) seal the game.
(4).  The move at 29 is probably the most serious mistake, and I recommend you read up on 4-4 approach josekis where black takes the corner.
(5).  In a sentence, the most important exchanges of this game are in the first 30 moves!

My criticisms may sound harsh, so let me say that this was a very good game: you didn't lose any major groups, your endgame was consistent, and you only lost by 25 points!  If I have been overly critical in this game, it's only because I want my advice to extend beyond this one game and help you improve your overall go sense.  You'll notice that several of my comments are simply "this feels better" or "this feels more natural" and that's because you develop go sense over lots and lots of games, and you will eventually start "feeling" your moves out rather than memorizing books or patterns.

All the best in the future.];B[qp]C[Haze. Please don't question my courtesy because in the SGF-File it looks like I made my first move in the lower right corner. In the game it was in the upper right - IGS saves the SGF files from another perspective.]
;W[dp];B[pc];W[qe]LB[mc:B][nd:A]C[J: This seems disadvantageous for white, and I think black has a chance to capitalize on it.

To go more in depth: the usual move would be a white move in the top left corner, which would normally be the best place to start forming a base for territory or influence, so white is definitely losing something by approaching black's corner instead.

Black plays at A, but I think I prefer B, because the move at A is on the 4th line and will require one more move to lock down the top side, whereas B is on the 3rd line and makes a solid base with no "open skirt" as they call it.

On the other hand, white does not respond to A (though he should have), so black's high response is better for attacking white's approach stone.]

(;B[nd]TR[nb][nc]C[J: This is what's known as an open skirt.  If it's territory you're after, you must close the skirt at some later point.]

(;W[dd];B[qg]C[J: This is good!  Fantastic opening for black so far.]
;W[oe]LB[og:B][qj:A]C[J: Black plays at A, but this is ignoring the "flow" of the game.

I think I would much prefer a move at B to put pressure on the white group and develop the top side at the same time.]

(;B[qj]C[Haze: Was this too defensive?

J: In a word, yes.  See comments on alternate variations.];W[pg]
LB[ph:A][qh:B]C[J: Black plays at A, but take a look at the variation at B.]

(;B[ph]C[J:  This move helps stabilize white's group and leaves a defect at R12.]
;W[og]
(;B[qd]C[J: Again, this move helps white.  Up to 23, white (the weak group) puts pressure on black (which should have been the strong group).]
;W[qf]
(;B[rg];W[od];B[oc];W[pd]
(;B[rd];W[ne]
(;B[nc];W[oh]
(;B[pi]TR[qd][ph][qj]C[J: Play out the moves from 10 to 23 three or four times.  Who is in control?  I don't really like how much black has been forced by what should have been a weak white group.  Not only that, but now white has a presence in the center which works well with the two star stones on the left.  The two biggest mistakes were R10, Q12, and R16.

An important thing to think about is this: at move 7, black had three (THREE!) stones in the upper right corner attacking one white stone.  Locally speaking this is a huge advantage, and yet after the sequence of moves up to 23, white has sente??  How can this be?  Sometimes, we must play solid and steady moves like R12 in order to seize the initiative to play elsewhere.  This idea is especially critical in the opening, and is why so much study has been put in to fuseki and joseki.  Sente is so important that sometimes professional or amateur dans will sacrifice three or four (or more!) stones to get the first move on a different part of the board. (In fact, I provided a variation for move 23.  You'll be surprised at the result!)

However, the game is far from over!  The good news is that all of black's groups are safe, so he can focus all of his attention on invading white's territory and erasing his influence.]

(;W[jd]LB[cf:B][dj:A]C[J: White is doing well, although this stone really should be at D10.  This means that black must immediately play somewhere on the left side (A or B are popular choices.  I'm the type of guy to play at B, but it probably comes down to personal preference).]

(;B[fq]C[J: This is not ideal.  The left side is more important.]

(;W[hq]
(;B[cq]C[Haze: Should I have jumped out instead? I didn't want to create a running group :/

J: This is ok, the mistake comes later...]
(;W[dq]LB[cp:A]C[J: White really should have played at A.]
(;B[dr]C[J: In my opinion, with this move, the game is over.  After white defends on the top of this group, his influence on the left and in the center are overwhelming.  In terms of shape, joseki, and board position, this black stone must be played at C4 (see variation).

Another thing to think about: at this point in the game, how many stones does black have on the 2nd line?  What about white?  What do you make of this?  (Note: it's not necessarily a bad thing to play on the 2nd line, but so early in the game, the stones on the 3rd and 4th lines are probably the ones working to their highest potential).]

LB[cf:A][cj:B][jq:C]C[J: I think if black has any hope of salvaging the game, don't bother saving the stone at S3 (Playing S4 is an endgame move.  It saves 6 points in gote, and there are MUCH larger fish to fry).  Moves at A, B, and C are huge, and could still turn the game around.

I gave a few example variations for comparison.]
(;B[rp]
(;W[ho];B[cj]C[Haze: Here I didn't know where to play or from where to approach.

J: This is the perfect place!  But be wary: white had plenty of opportunities to defend this (24, 32, 34, 44, 46), so you have to find the weaknesses and strike as soon as you can!]
;W[cl];B[cf];W[ce]LB[df:A]C[J: In the name of good shape, black should extend to A.]

J: F5 and E3 let white grab the initiative.  Furthermore, by this point you've probably looked over my comments about the opening, and that had a huge impact on what happened later in the game.]
;B[ja];W[kd];B[ha]C[J: This is pretty painful for black, but it seems necessary for life.]
;W[mc]C[J: This is not sente.]
(;B[nb];W[re]LB[oi:A][ko:D][ir:B][nr:C]C[J: A is a bit slow.  Perhaps black can make something happen with B, C, and D?  (Although it would be hard.  I played a few variations, and black will end up with a dangling group in the center).

This is my last comment..  I really enjoyed reviewing your game, so thank you!  I hope you have enjoyed reading my comments, and that you can get something out of them.]
