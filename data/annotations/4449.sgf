C[Dear reviewer: This is my firts game I send to be reviewed, many thanks in advance for reviewing this game for me. This is a game I recently played as white (17k) and lost against a 18k. There are many mistakes I made, but it would be very nice if you could mainly focus on the fuseki and how to invade the opponent's territory, but of course all comments are very much welcome.



Hi there,

I sent my first game for review when I was 17kyu and I must say that your comments remind me of the type of comments I used to make when I was 17k :)

I hope you appreciate the review.

Look me up on KGS if you have more questions, my nickname is Vindicare]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[cj];W[ec]C[I always play the corner enclosure for the 4-3 point as fast as possible.



It's a good move. Especially at your level since your opponents don't know how to attack it later on. It also has lots of potential for development.]
;B[pj]
(;W[nc]TR[ec][cd]C[I have problems to find the biggest point in the beginning. But as this is some kind of standard attack on tn the 4-4 point I often play this.


It's important that you understand the concept of "The biggest move", but you don't need to be able to find the biggest points all the time, just as long as you recognize that they exist so that you don't play a small point. With experience, you will get better at picking "the biggest move"

Beginners confuse big moves at the oppening as moves that will help them get territory or prevent the opponent from getting territory. This is an incorrect way of thinking.

A big move is a move that will act as a foundation for potential development during the whole game. They are important because the player who has the best foundation has more chances of winning the game.

O17 is certainly a big move since it will affect the development of the whole game. But I don't think it will lead to a good foundation because the position is flat.

A good foundation should allow you to build upwards. Unfortunatly, this type of position can be easily squished down by black.]
;B[pf];W[pc]C[Did that move belong to R17?

R17 is certainly playable and so is Q17 as long as you remember that you are building a foundation for the rest of the game. How you build will affect what will happen.]
;B[qc];W[od];B[oe]
(;W[lc]C[Trying to build a base...

I find this move odd.

Certainly it's to narrow, you should have extended at L17 if extending was what you wanted to do.

Personally, I would have played O15 because it builds upwards.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]
(;W[cg]TR[ec][cd]C[Not far enough.

There is a proverb:

Extend as far as you can from a strong position.

Your shimari is a strong position, so you should extend up to C12.]
;B[cm]C[How to handle such an attachment? As u will see, I was not able to prevent black from building a good base on the right.


Some combat rules:

1) if you can kill and get a good position, do it.
2) don't kill if your opponent can get a good position in exchange
2) if you can't kill then get a good thick position (a solid wall) and keep your opponent in a small position.
4) if you can't get a good position, don't fight 

The goal of combat is to get a good position globally];W[dm]
LB[hq:A]C[Good, this contributes to having a good position. Black is weak at A so the more stones you add in this area the weaker black becomes at A.]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[dk];W[dr]LB[hq:A]C[Now you putting huge ammounts of pressure on A]
;B[ch]
(;W[bh]C[No.

This doesn't contribute to a good position for you.];B[bi]
(;W[dh]LB[dg:A]C[Don't rush to atari.

Now you have a cutting point in your position once Black connects.]
;B[ci]
(;W[bg]LB[dg:A]C[Wrong.

you need to defend this against this cut.

Not only that, but you just lost your turn. You could have taken the initiative if you didn't need to defend at A.]
;B[hq];W[ql]C[I have also big problems to invade such mojos.

It's moyo.

In general, you don't want to invade moyos. You want to walk into moyos from the outside.

If you invade a moyo, your opponent will gain a nice position and it will secure all his territory. You want to keep the potential for reduction open as long as possible.

The trick with invading is to prevent your opponent from making a good position.]
;B[qn]C[See already the black corner looks secure, you can't do anything about it because you are under attack.]
;W[qj]C[You need to jump out.

If you live on the side, Black will have a big wall and his moyo will be too strong to invade again.]
;B[qi];W[ol];B[qk];W[pk];B[rk];W[oj]LB[nk:2][pm:1][nq:A]C[Good, you sacrificed your single stone to maximise the effect of your reduction

Black went for a small local gain, but globally you have a much nicer position.

Now you can invade at A, because you can connect to your group in the middle or live in the corner.

As you get stronger you will see that your position in the center is not really strong, and there are better ways to play, but the general sense of your play is correct. You just need to picture better shape.

Black can peep at 1 and 2, you will have a bad shape.];B[pi]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[nh];B[og];W[mh];B[jd]LB[mj:A]C[If you play A some time, you will have a nice shape.

But if black plays there and peeps the other 2 points, you will have a disastreous shape.]
;W[ic];B[le];W[jc]TR[nh][oj][pk]SQ[jd][le]C[Too low, this territory is unimportant.

You should be feeling embarassed to have to connect your stones like this.

Look at the black stones. If these stones were White, you would be shining right now.

At any point in the past you could have played here to get a nice position, but now that your opponent has them it hurts.

The triangled groups is weak, Black is ready to attack them to gain huge profit all around the board.]
;B[kd];W[kc]C[Do you see how you've been flattened down?

You need to avoid this type of situation.];B[dg]C[See, you didnt defend the cutting point. Now your gonna pay for it.]

;W[fe];B[he];W[gd];B[gg];W[mj]C[I was a little bit scared about that white group on the right, so I wanted to build at least one eye as fast as possible.


Yes... the most important point on the board for a while now...]
;B[dn];W[en];B[do];W[co];B[eo];W[fn];B[fo];W[fl]C[Same here, althuogh it did not function...]
;B[gn];W[fm];B[oq];W[hl]C[That white group (E6)  is quite weak i guess, so i tried to help it out.]

;B[dq];W[cr];B[eq];W[bn];B[bm];W[an];B[am];W[gf]C[No idea what i thought when i played this move..]
;B[hf];W[hg]C[I tried to cut, but i think both black groups are well even if the cut would have been succesfull.]
;B[fg];W[ig]
(;B[ge]TR[hg][ig][mh][mj][fl][hl]C[Cut did not work...



This is ok, your stones are all working together. Unfortunatly, they aren't accomplishing much. But they are working together which is worth something to mention.

Working together certainly does not mean they are safe from attack, it just means that they are in heavy interaction. Interaction between your groups is one of the keys to playing efficiently.

As you get stronger, your groups will be working together AND accomplishing something.

The problem with most players (I see this in dan games too) is that they either have all their groups working together but doing nothing, or all their groups doing something but not together. Both are bad.

If you can understand how to make your groups work together And do something, you will become very strong.

The connection between these groups is not really strong though. If Black applies himself he can probably kill one of the 3 groups here.]
;W[fd];B[ff];W[ee];B[rl];W[qm];B[rm];W[om];B[on];W[mn];B[mo]
;W[kn]C[Trying to build mojo in the middle...

moyo

Yeah, now your stones are accomplishing something.

But it's not enough, Black has too much territory at the bottom and on the side.]

moyo :)];B[ln]
(;W[mm]C[Rest of the game is not so important.

You lost because you let black get too much territory at the bottom, and because you didn't develop your position at the top towards the center.

In retrospect:

1) build upwards from your foundation, dont get flattened
2) stay connected and cut your opponenent
3) groups need to work together and accomplish something

I like how your invasion at R8 turned into a strong group in the middle, this is how you need to think when reducing moyos.

But you didnt use this group to make a second invasion. Next time, start an invasion to build a strong position in center, then invade a second time by threatning to connect or live inside.

Good luck!];B[lm];W[ll];B[nn];W[nm];B[gk]C[Now the desatser begins. I did not recognize that my E6 group is under attack.]
