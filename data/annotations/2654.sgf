C[i keep getting slaughered...

the main problem with my game is that, i don't know what my main problem is, and therefore do not know how to improve...

so i'd like to post a typical game (in which i lose by over 150pts) and see if someone should tell me, in plain terms, why i should never play go again...

(the 20kyu ranking is just an estimate...)


Rich: I think a key thing to realise is that you need to make territory at the corners and sides, where it's easier. Capturing a few stones will get a few points, cordoning off the corner could get a few dozen.

Generally in the opening, a play at the third line (lines C, R, 3 & 17) will take territory, a play at the fourth line (D, Q, 4 & 16) will make influence. I'll refer back to this later.]
PL[B];B[dp];W[pp]C[standard opening, right?


Rich: Good so far :)];B[dd];W[pc];B[gq]
(;W[pi]C[Rich: That's an unusual play for white; it's called the high Chinese opening, and the pattern is generally played by black. I'd either expect a play at Q14/R14, taking the corner and threatening to expand at K16 (see variation), or a play on the left.]
;B[pe]
(;W[od]MA[nd][qd][pg][jc][jd][kc][oc]C[what is appropriate here?

Rich: this is not a very strong move. Given the stone at Q11, black's stone should have to struggle to make space - close off the corner! Chasing weak stones like this is a great way to make territory.

A simple attachment joseki will let you keep the corner, and black's group will still have that Q11 stone staring at his back (see var.)]
;B[qc]MA[qd]C[r16 = normal response i believe

Rich: I believe so. R16, N17, whatever - a play around here is fairly urgent.]
;W[dj]MA[cj][ej]C[Rich: You *need* to sort out your top right first. A weak group can be worse than no group at all...

For this play, I would play a line lower at C10, just to get a good base in between the two black-influenced corners.]
;B[pd]C[r16 = blown opportunity for me i believe];W[oc]C[Rich: Good connection!]
;B[qh]
(;W[jd]MA[je][jc][kc][kd][id]C[Rich: The extension is a little far and high, if only because it provokes black's following move. Either approach the corner directly, or go for L17 and territory. (see var)]
;B[gc];W[fe]MA[ge][hd][ff]C[Rich: The problem with an 'attack' like this is that it encourages black to defend a large corner territory!]
;B[fd];W[ge]MA[ee][he];B[ch];W[df]MA[eg][eh]C[Rich: Again, forcing black to connect and become stronger. There are large points to be taken at the sides and on the bottom.]
;B[cf];W[dh]C[this looks solid to me

Rich: It would be better spent elsewhere; you make no territory from it - black could easily start a group around G12, for example, and it's not firmly connected to a living group such that it threatens black.]
;B[cc]C[Rich: Time to stop and take a quick look at the board territories developing.

Black has a strong upper left, a decent group on the upper right, and with another play could have a decent group in the lower left that could extend out either way. At least, a strong influence there.

White has a decent group on the top, some influence in the upper left and a single corner stone in the lower right. 

At this point, white should consider playing more for territory than for influence. Grab the sides and corner.

A problem could be that you're viewing that influence as territory; most people do at lower kyu levels. But if black makes a group around G12, you'll have little to show for it.]

(;W[ce]MA[de]C[mistake

Rich: Yep. :) We all make them. See variation.];B[de];W[cg]
SQ[cf]C[... though i believe i pulled out of it nicely];B[bf]
;W[bg]TR[ch]C[c12 is now defunct

Rich: Almost - it will be menacing if fighting starts below it. It's called 'bad aji' - maybe it's captured, but it's still on the board and can grow into a later problem.]
;B[be];W[ee];B[cl]CR[dk][dl][dm][do][dn]C[d9-d5 was left unprotected

Rich: yep, a big move.];W[dn]MA[cn][dl][dm]C[Rich: another attack that makes black seal off his corners and sides.]
;B[cn];W[bj]C[c12 already dead, right?

Rich: more or less. But one stone doesn't count for much against that big lower left of black's.]
;B[qj]
(;W[og]MA[pm][pj][oh][qi]C[Rich: There are much bigger plays to be made here; that stone wasn't really threatening much, so take your time to grab some points (see var)]
;B[nq]CR[jp]C[k4 was also left unchallenged

Rich: You could try a pincer play here, around L/M 3/4... but black's got G3 to make things tricky.]

(;W[no]MA[jq][jp][kq][ol][pm][om][nn][on]C[Rich: Good general rules for close fighting are-

Cut, or threaten to cut, your opponent's stones apart.
Connect your own stones
Extend along the sides.

Here there are some options - see variations.];B[kq]C[black is liking this

Rich: I would, too. :)];W[ok]MA[pj][om][pl][ol][pr]C[Rich: Another look at territory; black has at least 20 points top left, possibly another 15-20+ points top right, and over 30 points on the lower side.

White has around 15 at the top, about 8 on the left, and some influence in the centre. 

Put like that, you might see that this move is a little high. There are no points being made here.]
;B[qq]
(;W[oq]C[this should work

Rich: The standard reply to a 3-3 invasion like this is shown in the variation.]
;B[or]C[err... strengthen the q4 cluster, not cut o3-r3];W[np]
;B[mq]
(;W[rp]C[Rich: This leaves a lot of gaps. The variation is much stronger, if you want to keep the side cut off. Remember when fighting; cut, connect or extend away.]
;B[pq];W[op]CR[lo][qp][pm]C[q4 cluster now looks kinda weak]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[rq]
(;W[so]MA[sp]C[Rich: Another case where the solid connection is better - see variation. What you did at the top in the beginning.

This is something that gets better with experience, improved reading, and learning from things like this happening. Solid connections are strong, open connections are good for reaching out.]
;B[rn]CR[rm][rl][rk][rj][sm][sl][sk][sj][si][ri][rh][rg][rf]
[re][sd][se][sf][sh][sg]C[black gains about 20 pts of territory here right?

Rich: Much of it was already more or less his. But he gains about six, and deprives you of the same amount.]
;W[ro];B[pn];W[po]TR[qo][ro][so][rp]MA[om][ql][rl][pl]C[probably would have been better to let s5-cluster die...

Rich: It doesn't need to... but it is a nasty cut.];B[qn]
(;W[ql]C[Rich: Attacking now, with a weak group, is what led to the lower right getting surrounded. As you noted, black got stronger.

When stones are played close to each other, they get stronger. Often if you have two weak groups, only one can grow - you have to connect them or lose one. See variation.]
;B[pl];W[pk];B[ol];W[qk]C[through this next segment black gets stronger and i try to contain q8 unsuccessfully...]

Rich: Nope - as I said before, when stones play against each other, they get stronger, and the barrier is only as good as its weakest link. But you realise that it's a bad habit, so you're on the way to improving.]

any specific complaints about my strategy are welcomed... if you're going to say 'you suck, don't play igo again', at least give reasons

i've been playing for about five years, and most of my 19x19 games end up like this...

...err, most of the games i play against *other people*, not turbogo or igowin


Rich: Well, don't give up on go! You made some reasonable moves in there, but black just grabbed territory and grabbed territory.

As I said, try to think of the third line as taking territory, the fourth line as taking 'influence', building power for later. Try and balance the two early in the game; fight for the corners and the sides, there are a lot of points around them.

The other thing I would say is to study how stones connect. You lost a couple of groups because of nasty cuts that just worked, or peeps that made you heavy, and so on. A little more reading could save you from extending that space too far, or having an open connection where a closed one would be better.

Go is all about connecting and surrounding, not capturing and killing - the lower half of the board is a case in point. I think if your connections improve, your game will improve. 

Hope the comments were of some help; any questions, please feel free to email me.]
