C[Hello, my name is Martin (here at KGS: kinoni, black). zantog is white and 17k in KGS. I guess myself at about 24k.  I am a beginner, playing about 4 weeks. I have no grade on kgs yet. There are mainly 2 questions I have, concerning the opening and the endgame (39. move). I think I have not gained enaugh area influence. So where was my mistake mainly in the beginning and of course during the game. Thanks for advice and comments. :-)

Hello, I'm Gregor, thanks for letting me reviw aour game. I try my best.]
;B[gc]C[G: good start. another possibility would be to play in the center e5]
;W[gg];B[cd]C[G: good moves, both, w and b!];W[cf]C[G: w4 at c4 seems ok. Now b must attack, als hi must make up for the 5.5 Kuomi w gets. If both couver the same area, w wins!
The distance between the w  stones at the upper part and the w stones alt the lower part ist wide, so ther might be an fighting for connection.]

(;B[ee]C[G: I'd prefer an attack at the lower side.
I try:];W[ge]C[hmm, I thought I , black, would have here a better position. But this was wrong.

G: a bit more aggressive would be ot play the next b move at e3. I'll try some possibilities:]

(;B[fe]C[G: Better connection woud be at f6. Look!];W[ef]C[G: I thin, b could invade the lower left corner. W is here in avery high position and id must be possible to make two eyes beneath. I'll try some veriants:]

(;B[de];W[df]
(;B[ce]C[B: b11 at c5 is of no use at this stage of the game. the connection beween b3 and b9 cannot be cut anyway. if w plays c5, b plays d6 and vice versa. So b11 here is not good. Better idea:]
;W[fc];B[fd];W[ec];B[dc];W[gd];B[gb];W[fb];B[eb]C[G: b 19 is a mistake, but w makes no advatage of it. Look:]

(;W[hc]C[I have learned :-) I knew a can catch the 3 white stones!]
;B[fa];W[hb];B[ed]C[Should I have played at g9, instead at f4? Or better c4? I am not sure here.]

(;W[ha]C[G: w 24 ist not good. Better for w to play at f4 or b5. Look!]
;B[ff];W[fg];B[gf];W[hf];B[hg]C[Should I have played at g9, instead at f4? Or better c4? I am not sure here.

G: f4 isw very big, much better than g9. g9 brings nothing.]
;W[hd];B[bf];W[bg];B[af];W[ag];B[be]C[is b35 really the right move? white plays then g9, so I loose 1 point.

G: b35 at b5 is a must. otherwise b would loose the two stones ab4.]
;W[ga]
(;B[fb]C[G: no need to play at f8. Look:];W[ch]C[G: I'm not sure, if w38 at c2 is needed. I'll try an attack:]
;B[eg]C[In this situation, I tought, okay, I have not enough area. I have to take a risk. I wanted to cut and cath the white stones at f3 and g3]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[dg];B[gh];W[eg];B[hi]C[Is there any change to get my black stones in the corner living or maybe a seki? I do not think so.

G: I too, can't think of a way to surwive.];W[ig];B[he];W[ie]
;B[hh];W[fi]C[kinoni [?\]: no, I will not get 2 eyes
zantog [17k?\]: it is finished];B[tt]C[G: generally a interesting game. in the beginning b should bee more aggressive.
Thank you again for letting me review your game.

zantog [17k?\]: you were too weak there
zantog [17k?\]: in those corner
zantog [17k?\]: as i know
kinoni [?\]: yes i know, but i had too less area
zantog [17k?\]: you must be between 2x2 and 3x3
kinoni [?\]: I saw a very littly chance, maybe a seki
kinoni [?\]: I see. my first move to 3x3?
kinoni [?\]: no you was there
