C[Hello! My name is Tim and I'll be reviewing this game for you. I will insert comments where ever I find necessary and may include some variations as well. I'll try to give more ideas than hard set variations, though. 

You don't have to take courses to become a strong player. Just play as much as possible and solve some problems in your spare time.
----


Dear Reviewer.

Thank you very much for your time. This is a game I played against a friend on kgs. It was without time control and lasted quite a bit :-)

I put some of my thoughts into the file. Any hints remarks would be greatly appreaciated.

I'm mostly a self thought player as I don't have the funds to take ragular courses, thus I very much appreciate your service.

Greetings,
Cad.];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[iq];W[dm];B[dj]C[This feels like a perfect directional move. It hurts the influence of D16 while attacking. If I remember correctly, D9 accomplishes the same goal but gives a more harsh attack. I'd hardly know all the variations as to why, though. :)]
;W[ep]C[With this, I believe you have no choice but to cut and fight. This should get messy. :)]
;B[eo];W[do]LB[fo:A]C[Humm, unusual
I would expect A instead];B[dp];W[dn];B[eq];W[fp]C[I'm not sure what will be correct here, but I'd feel very tempted to just seal in the corner/side and have the points.]

(;B[fn];W[fo];B[en];W[dq];B[dr];W[fq];B[er];W[ho]
(;B[fl]LB[gm:A]C[Though is helps W get stronger on the bottom, I might be tempted to play G6 first. It is a forcing move that improves your shape as well. It is a key point between the W and B stones. Assuming W defends that play, you have time to attack the left side stones more thoroughly.
--


I don't really like this anymore, after white's play I get into bad form. maybe just a Kosumi (A) instead ?]
;W[el]C[G6 still seems valuable, after which you may be able to aggressively E9.

don't know what's the Shape ove here is .. or maybe g6 myself ?]
;B[hm];W[gn]C[Now I have a problem that I don't like any move :-)]
;B[gm];W[fm]C[Painful, hehe. White ceases control of the game with this move.

This wasn't intentional .. just misread.];B[fk];W[qn];B[on]
C[trying t start on moyo or something];W[qk]
(;B[jo]C[This is just the idea I had in mind as well. I think here you can use the touching play of J5 as well.]
;W[ol]C[This move seems to hurt, though. It seems to have a weakness if you start with a force at Q7, but you may need to develop some strength around R14 first]
;B[hn];W[go]C[Want to strengthen the left side];B[fc];W[ic]
C[W chooses a good directional play.];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[fd];B[qf]LB[nc:A]C[It is easier to flatten the top with K16 because you have some center-facing stones. 

A was suggested instead.

My idea was that I play first here because there's more room on top to reduce later.]
;W[qe]C[I wanted to treat that stone lightly but decided to move up 
anyway for now];B[pf];W[nd]
(;B[rp]C[I don't think this can be afforded.
--

Well maybe not big enough at that time.]
(;W[qh];B[mg]C[Quite far jump. but I don't want to run away in a straight line.
I figure that will just have no chance to win at all, but try to build a wall instead]
;W[ng];B[ne];W[oe];B[of];W[nf];B[me];W[re];B[mh];W[nh];B[mi]
;W[md]LB[mf:A]C[I guess white still should push first];B[mf]
;W[ml];B[oi];W[oh];B[ni];W[pi]C[just forcing sequence to reduce and strengthen my group I thought]

(;B[mo]C[meant to make that territory more safe, but I dunno if that is a good spot.]
;W[ke];B[jg];W[if];B[ig];W[hf];B[hg]C[liza [-\]: ^^];W[kk];B[ll]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[mj];B[nk];W[oj];B[nj];W[ok];B[eg]C[Yes, I think you got more than you deserved in the center, hehe. I would probably play C8 before this move. It threatens the W group a bit and the side is larger than the few points this move adds.
--

Well that plan with the wall and middle worked so far. I'm not feeling really behind like now. Though the bottom territory is still quite open]
;W[ch]C[White overplay];B[dg];W[be];B[ce];W[bf];B[bg]LB[ck:A]
C[white prolly should play a first now];W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B[bj]
LB[bk:A]C[maybe A .. thought about that. looked more solid this way though]
;W[ck];B[cj];W[lm];B[kl];W[km];B[jl];W[nl];B[qp]C[I thought this was bigger then m7 first .. I wasn't sure if it works]

C[I think you will have a hard time winning at this point. 

C is probably the best point here.

Well so far so good .. I'm feeling behind now.

Marked big moves I see here.

I tried A first, but I can't find a sequence to keep sente. So I should probably leave it. or is there a better sequence]

;W[ms];B[or];W[jm];B[il];W[fe];B[aq];W[ef];B[df]C[bad blunder]
;W[ji]C[An unfortunate turn indeed. It was a moderately close game back and forth. I think perhaps W got too much on the right and should not have been allowed to live on the bottom. 

I think you should continue to play in the manner that you do, and continue to strengthen your attacking skills. You lost in the end this time, but I think you will progress quickly using this style because you played it very well.

Had the original snapback not occured, this would have been a more simple game for you, so try to watch for the basics. :)

Let me know if you have any further questions! My email is helxis@comcast.net.

Thanks,
Tim
