C[Hi

I feel this game is a good representation of where I am at in my Go development.

I am playing black, and my opponent is ranked higher than me (16 kyu compared to my 17).

I am mostly hoping that you will point out what I need to focus on to efficiently work my way through the double digit kyu ranks.

Please also see my notes at moves 74 and 268.

I am looking forward to receiving your comments!

Thank you very much!

Dave

\]];B[pd]C[kuroko14: Hi!];W[dp];B[pp];W[ed];B[jc]LB[cd:A][pj:D]
[fq:B][gq:C]C[[Broege:
Personally I'd prefer either an immediate karari in the upper corner (consider A for example) or approaching the lower corner from the right side (B or C). D is also a possibility.
However, I cannot quickly refute the move played.
\]];W[jq];B[qj]LB[oj:B][pj:A]C[[Broege:
This is definitely too low. Playing at A is more common. Now White can easily play B and extend to either side, lowering Black position.

Of course, approaching the upper corner is still a viable option.
\]];W[ej]LB[ed:A][ej:B]C[[Broege:
On the other hand, White play is too high. With A and now B White is being greedy.
\]];B[nq]LB[qc:E][cd:C][cj:D][hq:B][lq:A]TR[jc][qj][jq]C[[Broege:
Again, this is too slow.
This move does not attack White triangled stone (for this, A would be better - or even B if you prefer to start a fight on the lower edge. On the other hand, it still does not completely secure the corner - see the variant.

Black should either attack the left side (perhaps starting with C or D), the bottom (as stated previously) or find some other useful move.
Even a defensive move like E would be better - as the corner formation in relation to the triangled stones is quite strong.
\]]
(;W[hc];B[je]LB[mc:A]C[[Broege:
Good, Black is starting to build more influence towards the centre.
Playing at A would be too defensive.
\]];W[he];B[jj]C[[Broege:
Again playing for the influence - good.
\]];W[mm];B[gm]LB[cj:A][pm:C][fp:B]C[[Broege:
I must admit that I don't see the plan behind this move and the last White move.
If it was to be an invasion - it should have been played at A.
If it was to be a reduction - it should have been played at B probably.

The stone played is neither putting any pressure on White nor helping Black with extending its influence nor taking territory.

One can also "protect" against White move with C, taking territory. But for now White move should probably be ignored completely.

As a general remark, one should always aim at moves that serve some purpose (either attack, defend or extend own influence or territory). If a move can serve more than one purpose (for example attack and at the same time extend own territory)- even better.
This is especially true during the opening, when a few unnecessary moves may mean that the opponent will gain too much and the game will already be lost.
\]];W[mj];B[jm]LB[je:A][ig:C][oi:D][jj:B][ko:E]TR[qj]C[[Broege:
Again a move without any real purpose.

First of all you should decide of your plan - and then follow it, adapting it of course to what your opponent plays.

Plays at A and B suggested that Black is trying to gain some influce. If so - push White further with moves like C or extend the influence while protecting against White moves with D.

If the plan now is to cut White stones - probably E would be better as it is at the same time pressuring the single White stone and cannot be easily ignored on the bottom side. However, please remember that White has quite big a space to live in - it can attack the triangled stone to gain some strength there.
\]];W[lo];B[jo]LB[kp:A]TR[jj][gm][jm]C[[Broege:
Try A if you want to separate White stones.

But, as already stated in previous comments, there are more strategically important moves - attacking the left side is still a priority. Playing here only wastes a stone for Black - triangled stones are not in any danger and White stones are strong enough.
See the variant for what could happen in White ignored this move and played to strengten the left side.
\]]
(;W[kp];B[ig]TR[mj]C[[Broege:
Good, push over the boundaries of the influence spheres.
However, please note that due to the triangled stone, Black influence here is no longer that important.
If this move was played at move 15, it would be much stonger then.
\]];W[gq];B[mh]LB[oi:A]C[[Broege:
Good thinking - protect your sphere of influence while you can.

However playing at A would be more efficient - if White tries to invade more, Black will take huge territory on the right side.

Please remember that a sphere of influence is not a territory yet - and one should not treat it as such. I remember that while being double-digit kyu it was one of the easiest mistakes to make.
Moreover, usually the sphere of influence won't be converted to territory directly, it will rather help you gain territory somewhere else by attacking invading stones. Of course, if the opponent does not invade, then you can convert it to territory directly.
\]];W[pm];B[ok]LB[oi:A][nl:B]C[[Broege:
Again A would be better. This move attacks White (it can protect easily with B) but does not gain anything for Black.
And if White wants to fight with A, Black can find itself in a tight place.
\]];W[nl];B[on]C[[Broege:
Again a waste of a stone.

Before playing a move always try to imagine what you can gain if your opponent will ignore it and play elsewhere - and what you will lose instead. This might help you to refrain from playing forcing moves which don't have that big a threat behind them.
Please see sample variants to see how much Black can gain here and how much can be lost on the left side.
\]]
(;W[om];B[qm]LB[qn:A]C[[Broege:
If you wish to protect your territory so hard, play A.

But please remember that the left side is still much, much bigger.
\]];W[qn];B[ql]TR[qj][ok][qm]C[[Broege:
Black is getting heavily overconcentrated here.
Consider the four triangled stones - how much territory do they take? And what if we remove the two bottom ones? Almost no change in Black territory - which means that those two stones could have been used elsewhere, to a better effect.
\]];W[pn];B[oo]LB[qp:A]C[[Broege:
Black should rather protect the corner with A than secure a single, unimportant stone.
Please see the variant what happens if White invades the corner now.
\]]
(;W[ni];B[nh]LB[og:A][ph:B][oi:C]C[[Broege:
In general, a loose move (like A or B) is better at protecting against such creeping in.

The move played invites White C and then Black has to take care about its right-side group.
\]];W[qp];B[qo]LB[po:A]C[[Broege:
A mistake. What whould Black play after White A? See the variants.
\]]
(;W[ro];B[po];W[rm];B[qq];W[rp];B[oq]LB[rq:A]C[[Broege:
Not needed. If Black is afraid to be killed here, the best answer (except reading the whole corner, which is probably too much even for 10 kyu) is to take as much space as possible with A.
\]];W[rl];B[rk];W[pi];B[pj]LB[qi:A]C[[Broege:
Again, Black should rather extend its living space with A. If White plays A now, Black will be hard-pressed - see the variants.
\]]
(;W[oi];B[qi]LB[qh:A]C[[Broege:
You should jump as far as you can. Here A is still safe and at the same time stops White more tightly.
\]];W[pg];B[ph]LB[qh:A]C[[Broege:
As it does not stop White from entering (as seen in the game), it would be better to protect the right-side group more strongly.
If White decided to play A, Black would have to give up the stone just played - see the variations.
\]]
(;W[oh];B[qh];W[ng];B[mg]LB[qf:A]C[[Broege:
It would be more profitable to protect the side than the centre (e.g. with A).

In general, there is more territory to be gained on the sides than in the centre (unless you're Takemiya Masaki, of course).

This is the last comment related to the opening phase and the strategy. The comments regarding the left side still hold true, though.
From now on I'll try to concetrate on selected tactical issues only.
\]];W[nf];B[pf]LB[qf:A]C[[Broege:
Blocking at A works, the one played not (as shown in the game).
As a reading exercise, try (as White) to cut through A towards the side. You should not be able to do so - although of course White can still push towards the top.
\]];W[qg];B[rg];W[qf];B[qe];W[mf];B[lf];W[md];B[nd];W[le];B[rf]
LB[lg:A][lh:B]C[[Broege:
This leaves a weakness at A - if Black extends with the stone in atari, White will play B and get 3 stones.

Preferably this weakness should be fixed before attacking those three stones.
\]];W[og];B[ke]LB[kf:B][lg:A]C[[Broege:
The weakness at A is still there - so this is clearly a tactical mistake. Playing at B would avoid the problem and still connect the stones.
\]];W[lg];B[kf];W[lh];B[lj];W[mi]C[Ok.  I was feeling pretty good about my play until he took these three stones.  Then it was obvious that he had me on the defensive.  Please offer advice on how I could have better leveraged our respective starting positions.  Thanks!

[Broege:
Well, those three stones were not that important. Sure, it's a tactical mistake but by no means it lost the game (I rember doing 20+ points blunders and still winning games when about 15 kyu.

In the current position the left side is still left wide open - so you can still atack there, as already noted a number of times. Please look at the comments once more and try to play for youself how the game could have developed from the variants shown there.

But it's also true that in the current position White has only strong groups while Black groups are separated and the centre stones are slightly scattered. So yes, the game is more or less lost now (at least objectively, at 15-kuy level it might turn out differently).
\]];B[kh]C[[Broege:
This is again an overconcentration of stones.

LB[nb:A]C[[Broege:
Why not just A?
\]];W[nb];B[lc];W[ld];B[oe]LB[ob:A][pb:B][rb:C]C[[Broege:
You really should block at A, otherwise White can jump at B and then C and take the most of Black's corner.
\]];W[lb];B[ob];W[ne];B[of]C[[Broege:
This only one point - if White played there Black would simply connect.
Such a small play should be left late in the endgame, there are many much biggers plays still left on the board.
\]];W[em];B[eg]LB[cd:A][cj:B]C[[Broege:
Black can still go much deeper - both A and B are safe (as in anything between those two points). And of course going deeper means reducing White potential territory much more.

;W[hj];B[ii];W[fk];B[ei]LB[gk:A]C[[Broege:
The cut at A would be better - it captures three stones and, much more importantly, connects the side stones to the centre, making them safe.
\]];W[gk]C[[Broege:
Now Black has a problem - the left-side stones are pretty weak and need to be strengtened quickly.
On the other hand, the centre group is not as strong as it may look - White could gain quite a lot in the lower-left quarter by attacking it from below.

[Broege:

To sum up the game:

Black made some tactical blunders but luckily neither of those exploited by White was directly responsible for loosing the game (remember, White could have killed the lower right corner).

I think that the game was lost on strategic level - the left side was left unplayed for much too long and White took quite a lost of territory there. Also the inability of Black to stop White from pushing into the right side played a big role in the final result.


As for major areas of improvement I'd suggest:

1. Practice your reading so you make less tactical mistakes; I'd recommend some life&death problems and, probably even more in your case, exercising blocking invading opponent stones and cutting through weak chains.

2. Try to think how big a move is before playing it. As most of the double-kyu players you tend to answer all forcing moves, even if they threaten a single stone. Quite often such forcing moves can be ignored to play a big move (not necessarily a forcing one) by your own.

3. Try to refrain from playing moves without a real purpose. And when you are sure they serve a purpose: - make sure that the move you play is as effective as possible (e.g. takes most territory, connects in a strongest manner)
- if only possible, make the move that has more than one purpose
- try to choose a move that your opponent won't ignore (e.g. by imagining what worst can happen to him/her if he/she ignores this move).

4. Try to limit your opponent's area of influence as early as you can. The more you wait, the harder it gets to limit it effectively.

Well, that's about it.
