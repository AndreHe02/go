;B[pd]C[A DGS game in 2008-2009.
White: Jaakko S채rel채, DGS 8 kyu [the one who submitted at GTL, JS\]
Black: DGS 8 kyu

Hi Jaakko,

My name is Riaan and I'm a 3k on KGS, I mostly play as "sakkie".

I think you did an excellent job of reviewing your own game, which is really important if you want to become stronger.  I will do my best to point out mistakes that you may have missed.

Hope you find this review helpful!

(;B[mf]
(;W[nq]C[[R\] O3 might be better at O4.];B[kp]C[[R\] Personally i would be very scared to play the same joseki again here.  Black's territory becomes very very cash-like.]

;W[mq];B[mn]C[[JS\] black looks over concentrated

[R\] He does look overconcentrated, but I would be pretty happy if i was black.  His stones have a good relationship on a grand scale.  If this becomes territory white will have a hard time to make enough points.]
;W[kj]
(;B[cj]C[[JS\] I don't know if tenuki is good here

[R\] Yes, n10 is certainly a must.  White may invade at R10 too sometime soon, since almost every single black stone is invested in that area.]

(;W[nj]C[[JS\] destroys black area lightly

[R\] I would prefer N10 to avoid being cut.];B[cf];W[fc];B[cd]
;W[cc];B[de];W[bd];B[be];W[ce]C[[JS\] first take of ko is always for free]
;B[mj]C[[JS\] should white ignore?

[R\] O10 was too far.  R10 invasion possible though.]
(;W[mk];B[cd];W[lj];B[bc]LB[mj:A]C[[JS\] should white take at A?

[R\] Capturing A is huge! Ponnuki in the middle of the black territory is extremely valuable.  You should capture A, or take the ko.]

(;W[dc]C[[R\] Why this!?  Have you forgotten about the ko and N10?  You made the M10 threat for a reason?]
;B[mi];W[ce]C[[R\] Now you suddenly remember the ko? This is weird ^^]
;B[lk];W[ll];B[nk];W[kk];B[nl]C[[R\] Now you see why o10 was risky.  Black may be very happy with this, his territory is massive and practically cash.]

(;W[ee]C[[R\] Dubious.  I would rather block the ko and see if black defends, giving me sente.]
;B[cd];W[lf];B[ad];W[id]C[[R\] Note that L16 may still escape, which means that C15 settled for free.]

(;B[cq]LB[lg:B][cn:A][fq:C]C[[JS\] This does not look like a good invasion point: developing the left side (at A, e.g.) looks better. To play at B would be important, too.

[R\] I think this is pretty good for black.  Were he to approach at A he would become very concentrated, and the pressure on his L4 stones would become extreme.  I would consider approaching at C if I were black. This way he can create a relationship with his L4 stones.]

(;W[dq]C[[JS\] I think this is the correct side to block, see variation

[R\] Yes, this is correct for the reason you gave, but also to prevent threats around L4]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo]
(;W[bn]C[[JS\] double hane looks better than the peaceful variation, since white has strength in the center]
;B[cn];W[do];B[bm];W[bp];B[an];W[bq];B[kn];W[jo];B[ko];W[iq]

(;B[jp]C[[R\] Very poor move.  See variation.];W[ip]TR[jp]C[[R\] This exchange shows you how very kind black is! He has taken away 1 point and given you about 15!]
;B[io];W[ho]C[[R\] Again!];B[in]C[[R\] Now he has given you sente! What a gentleman.]

(;W[ef]
(;B[lg]C[[JS\] a very painful move for white

[R\] Hmm, escaping with L16 might be even more painful... although it's now much more difficult since you played E14.]

(;W[kf]C[[R\] K15 is a better response i think.  Gives black less forcing moves.]
;B[kg];W[jf];B[jg];W[if];B[hn];W[go];B[ij]C[[JS\] suddenly the center group is in danger

[R\] I would go as far as to say that it is probably dead.]

(;W[jm]
(;B[km]C[[JS\] good move, white was hoping for K6

[R\] Variation even better.];W[kl]
(;B[ml]C[[R\] Hmm, N8 was a big mistake.  Extremely small.  See variation.]
;W[il]C[[JS\] very passive; J9 is more active and probably white either lives or gets out


[R\] Will be a tough fight for white no matter what.];B[hl]
;W[ik];B[hk]C[[JS\] white played very passively and should die now

[R\] White should die because he captured L16 and gave L13 wall.]
;W[ii]
(;B[hi]C[[R\] Variation better.];W[jj];B[ih];W[hj];B[gj];W[hh]
C[[JS\] multi-stage ko for white: very difficult

[R\] More than white could have hoped for.];B[ij];W[qj];B[qk]
;W[hj];B[gi];W[jh];B[ig];W[kh];B[li];W[ki];B[ij]
(;W[pk]C[[JS\] black should probably ignore, because the center group is huge and it is not even certain that the white invasion lives

[R\] Yes, but Q9 could be better placed at S9 I think.  Try that double hane a lot.]
;B[pl];W[hj];B[cr]C[[JS\] very small compared to the group in stake

[R\] Not many other threats.];W[ij];B[dr];W[er];B[br]LB[es:A]
C[[JS\] black ends in gote: not good. However, black has a big endgame play at A which he should definitely get

[R\] Black had little other choice.  His play in the center was bad.]

(;W[rc]C[[R\] The variation is better I think, might seem gote, but i don't think it is.]

;B[rn];W[sd];B[se];W[sc];B[rf]C[[JS\] White thinks he can win in the endgame and takes big sente plays.  Should B have ignored one of them?

[R\] Certainly not.];W[eh]

[R\] Too right.];W[gg];B[ie];W[he];B[gf];W[ge];B[fg];W[ff];B[eg]

(;W[gm]LB[cg:A][ek:G][hm:F][dn:D][gn:E][kr:C][es:B]C[[JS\] black has many possibilities. I think that B is by far the biggest

;B[cb];W[db];B[bb];W[af]LB[es:A]C[[JS\] threatens a ko in the corner, but black can probably play at A anyway

[R\] Losing G5 is bigger than losing C16 ^^]
(;B[ae];W[ds]LB[bj:B][es:A]C[[JS\] until this time white hoped that black does not play at A, but didn't dare anymore. And there is a chance that black answers locally]

[R\] B is poor, H2 is correct.]
(;W[is];B[hp]C[[JS\] loss cannot be avoided: white resigned after a few moves
