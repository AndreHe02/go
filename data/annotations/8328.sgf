C[In this Game I Played Black. We got into battle a couple of times, but in the end I lost by 14,5 points. Could you point out my main mistakes?

Hagios: Hi, I'll do my best to highlight the main points of the game for you, and give some alternative ways to think.]

(;B[ic]LB[dq:A]C[I like to play the low chinese fuseki when I hold blacks.

H: In this case, it allows W to build a bit faster, which I don't like.]

(;B[qe]C[And yet I managed to make a stranger move still. If I took the 3-3, would it have been better?]
