C[A play at 'a' would make it difficult for  Black to build a Moyo on the left side if you wish to disallow that.]

;W[fc]WL[255];B[cj]BL[261];W[qf]LB[fq:a]C[A play at 'a' would stop Black from expanding the  black moyo. It is more urgent than approaching Black in the upper right  corner.]

[qj:b][kq:c][pf:d]C[White 'a'  and 'b' are alternatives. A move at 'a' should be ok because Black has to  play 'c'. A move at 'b' looks a little like an overplay but since Black has  not played 'd' there is bad aji in that black group that White can aim at.]
WL[126];B[qq]BL[199];W[iq]C[MK: I think, my opponent is allready leading at  this point, but I connot find any mistake of mine. Is my judgement wrong?

MP: White has more solid territory, but Black has developed in a way that  look good to the eye. See my previous comments to what might have been done  differently. This is not a lost game, but it is a game where White probably  has to fight in the lower left quadrant.]

BL[84];W[bq]LB[co:a]C[White 'a' is an  alternative - but then White will have two weak groups.]

C[MK: Again I feel that my opponent gained more than  he should at the left side.

MP: As long as the White group in the lower side is not killed it does not  look too bad. In fact the Black stones look a little inefficiently placed.]
WL[43];B[ro]LB[hp:a]C[I think Black must play 'a' or something like that  now.]
BL[583];W[rn]WL[36];B[qo]BL[580];W[hr]LB[hp:a]C[Wrong point. It look like  White tries to play sente against 4 points of Black territory.  A white move  at 'a' would be much better. It would defend the White group while taking it  out in the center and most importantly it flattens Black potential moyo in  the center completely.]

C[Now White is in severe trouble]BL[552];W[jd]LB[ge:a][if:b]
C[This is bad, because Black does not want to play here. Black want to play  moves like 'a' followed by 'b' in order make a huge moyo. Also white take a  huge risc in leaving the lower side group like this.

A move at 'a' or something is much better.]WL[24];B[lr]BL[521]

;W[hd]WL[564];B[if]TR[jd]C[Black  plays these beautiful moves that make a huge ideal territory in the center.  Also note that the triangled white stone did not have any effect at all in  preventing this. Now the game look won for black.]
BL[487];W[ol]LB[jj:a]C[MK:  Too small?

MP: Yes, it does not threaten anyting serious. A move at 'a' threaten to  erase the Black center territory and could lead to some confused fighting.  White do not have enough territory to match the black center...]
WL[555];B[jj]BL[481];W[jh]C[Now it is too late to do anything substantial.]

;B[il]BL[550];W[mf]LB[ri:a]C[Non-urgent point. A move at 'a' is large and there is some further hope of  attacking the Black group. It also defends the white group on the right side.]

WL[575];B[nl]BL[430];W[nk]WL[572];B[ok]C[MK: Game over... But my  opponent was leading anyway, so I thought I must do something special like  m14.

MP: The problem with m14 is that it is not special in any way I can see. Your  only chance to win this game was to attack the black group in the upper right  but Black was allowed to defend it AND attack your group instead.]

;B[bf]C[MK: Time to  resign (and so I did).

MP: A final summary: I think you (white) lost because you tend to overlook  the urgent points( that is: points that are more important than big points)  such as:
** points that both expand your moyo and reduce the opponents.  ** points that defend your group and also has secondary purposes such as  attacking or reducing.

I also got the impression that you are too concerned about single stones  (both your own and your oppnents) and forget about the whole board. In this  game the black stones were all strategically very efficently placed but the  White stones often ended up like endgame moves that was played too early.

For each move you have to think: "What if my opponent ignores this move?"]
