;W[fc]C[I did not know how to react to this my first instinct was to extend, but I thought I might not be able to protect the middle so I played elsewhere

JMR
I agree: tenuki is good. Black at Q10 now would mean that ALL his stones are co-ordinating in a coherent strategy of making a large strong moyo. If W plays again in the top left, say G16, she is becoming overconcentrated, and B has a larger, more efficient position.]

(;B[cn]C[JMR
Q10 would make good use of all the stones. (If you play in this corner it is normally slightly better to play on the other side, from your own corner (bottom right), not his (top left)).]
;W[gd]C[should've extended here too]
(;B[cg]C[JMR
This is the move I would like to concentrate on to demonstrate a couple of simple principles.

1 "Don't approach strength" is a reliable Go proverb.
2 We need to monitor the strength of groups constantly. Nasty surprises often come when we don't modify our assessment of a group when a nearby group gets stronger.

Which is stronger - 2 or 9 (D4 or C6)? Since 2 is in the corner, it is slightly stronger. So if you have a weak group near a strong group, either you sacrifice it for an alternative gain, or make it stronger.

So the commonsense move here is to make 9 (C6) stronger, at C9 or 10. (Alternatively, the "sacrifice" strategy would be to play F3).

Which is stronger - 11 (C13) or the top left corner group? No question here - the W group is massively thick, and 11 is too close to it, and very weak. ("Don't create weak groups in the opening").

So W plays (12)  ...];W[ck]C[... this, and separates the two weak stones. Now W has one weak group to Black's two. For every move that W makes strengthening 12 (C9) B will only get to defend one of his groups, and the other willl come under attack.

"Don't make weak groups in the opening" is another reliable Go proverb.]
;B[en];W[fp];B[ek]C[JMR
I like this move. The temptation might be to strengthen 11 (C13), but this move means B has only 1 weak group (11), that he will sacrifice, and the C6 group is now strong.]
;W[dj];B[hq]C[JMR
I like this move. This attack on the W group is on the right spot, and is the payoff Black gets for strengthening the C6 group (with E9), and neglecting C13.]
;W[go];B[jp]
(;W[ej]C[JMR
An important point for both sides. B could have pushed here first (before 17) sacrificing 11, but building strength.

It does mean though, that W has not responded locally to 19 (K4) which is making the W group weak. A honte response to 19 could be C3. The W group is then bullet-proof, and can be used to attack the B stones on either side of it; or W can move out into the centre more, with G7, K6 or H4.

So: which group to strengthen - F4 or D10? The corner group has STRONG B groups on either side, so it is very weak if Black C3 is allowed. The D10 group has a very WEAK group on one side (C13), so it can be left weak.  That means, I would contend, that one should spend a move making the corner group stronger.]
;B[cq]C[JMR
Good move consistent with the strategy of attacking the W group, which is now very weak.]
;W[cp]C[JMR
The right direction, I think.];B[gk]C[JMR
Inconsistent. If this group needs strengthening now, rather than responding to 22 with B4, then 21 was premature and should have been at 20 (E10).

It becomes a good move if W responds to it!]
(;W[eh]C[JMR

If W is going to respond around here, I think one higher at E13 is better: it suppresses 11 (C13) better, and W can expect to jump further from his 2 stone wall at D/E10.

But I would remove the aji of 21 (C3) by playing 24 at D3 or E2: the W E10 group is weak, but so is C13.  If B then attacks at F10, W can respond with this (E12), and it is obvious that the W group is not weaker than the B (C13). Alternatively, if Black pulls out at E13 ... (see variation).]
;B[ff]C[JMR
Nice choice of point for making the most of the aji of 5 and 11 (F16 and C13).  I think the hottest area is the bottom left though.]
;W[df];B[eg];W[dg];B[fh];W[fi];B[fe]LB[gh:a][hh:b][hf:c]C[JMR

Ouch! Horribly heavy and overconcentrated. Don't think of rescuing 5 (F16). Black 31 at A, B or C would be better.]
;W[gh];B[hf];W[fg]LB[dq:a][er:b]C[I thought this group had a good enough form to survive. So I played elsewhere. but should've played a bigger move

JMR
I think that tenuki around 35 is a good move, making use of all the B stones in the bottom left to attack D4 etc, which becomes very weak.

In fact this move (34) is small, strengthening a group which is already strong; but how strong is W in the bottom left corner? 34 should be at A or B.

This is a good moment to compare the reduction in W territory given by 33 (H14) etc., with the reduction suggested for comparison in my variation at move 11. Go to the end of that variation, and look at the reduction and also the shape of the black group around C6. This deficit is largely the result of playing 11 close to thickness, creating 2 weak groups.]

(;B[er]C[JMR

This is the right idea - to attack W, but is not the ideal spot, as W can respond at D3, and get stronger quite easily. The conventional move is B4: see variation.]
;W[fl]C[JMR

Local replies might be B3 or D3, but this is a good, creative idea, counterattacking rather than responding locally to 35.]
;B[fk];W[eq];B[fr];W[el];B[fn];W[gn];B[gl]C[JMR
This is a key point. The natural reaction to it locally is to play White D8, avoiding B having a stone at either end of this group.]
;W[gm]C[JMR
Instead W helps his weak group (understandable), and threatens to connect his stones and capture the B group.]
;B[dk]C[JMR
This is difficult to read. I will generally restrict my comments to strategic observations, as they are more generally applicable.

B has correctly ignored W's threat to link up F7, making use of the W weaknesses at F7 AND C10.]
;W[dl];B[cl]
(;W[fm]C[JMR
This is a tactical mistake. More consistent with the threat of capturing the stones around E6 is to atari at C7. W has the option of connecting at either D7 or F7 (miai).]
;B[cj]LB[cm:a]C[JMR
W can still atari at A, and get a reasonable result.]
(;W[bk];B[bl]C[JMR
Now the B stones at C6 and C13 come in very handy, and make the cut at 47 (C8) work.]
;W[dn]C[JMR
Nice idea, but surely it doesn't work if B ataris above, and both sides connect?]
;B[ci]C[JMR
A huge reverse sente move, not just claiming territory, but turning W territory into B. W could have played atari here, and again at B11 in sente]
;W[do]C[JMR
In exchange W can now play this, making 52 work, and making the W group strong (although still not completely alive).]
;B[pf]LB[pj:a][qn:b][nq:c][hd:d]C[Was this a good move?

JMR
I think so. A shimari is huge, and to be able to play one so late in the game is great.

Comparing it with alternatives it seems a sound choice: A, forming a moyo, seems a bit dubious given the strong W groups poised to make reductions or rescue fleeing groups. B and C are a bit far from the action: the black group around H14 is still weak. This move indirectly strengthens it, and better than on the 3rd line at R14.

An alternative I like is D, strengthening it directly.  It's a bad idea to have weak groups around.]
;W[qk]C[I had no idea how to react to this. These moves are my biggest problems

JMR
A move on the 3rd line on either side will squeeze this and also make territory. Your choice is fine.]
;B[qm]C[JMR
Black is clearly winning, comparing the solid territories and the influence for each side.]
;W[mq]C[This made it even worse

JMR
It is an overplay, but an understandable idea since W is behind.]

(;B[pq]C[JMR
This is the sort of thing, but I prefer the other side, L3, since
a) this is good shape but too far away from 58 to exert much pressure;
b) the connections of 39, 17 and 19 (F2, H3, K4) are thin, and close to W thickness. Do you want to push W towards the left where the cuts will become possible?
c) If W then invades at R3 he will end up in gote;
d) If W then jumps out at N5, then you can play at Q3, securing territory, whilst the W moves secured none, in fact left 2 weak W groups to be attacked.

You also have the choice of R11 instead, securing territory whilst attacking over there.]
;W[kr];B[nr]C[JMR
Same comment about which side. Now the potential cuts are becoming more obvious.]
;W[ir];B[hr]C[JMR
Now the cuts are glaring AND the B group is short of eyespace. Compare with the variations with 59 L3.]
;W[jq]C[JMR
Now you have to waste a move just avoiding the cut.];B[ip];W[kp]
;B[jm]C[JMR
This doesn't attack anything, or gain any territory (although it does defend the B group). B3 would defend it and secure a lot of territory.]
;W[qh]C[JMR
So W successfully invaded at the bottom IN SENTE, although B secured some territory with 59 & 61.]

(;B[qg]C[Another such move

JMR
I'm not keen on this move. Remember you don't attack by touching. I would prefer R14. Now, is that (R14) gote or sente? If W responds at S12 or 13, how important is it to reply on the second line for Black? It is an end-game move. But if W ignores R14 she will come under severe attack.]
;W[rh]
(;B[rg]C[JMR
Small (although more important than if you had made good shape at R14 instead of R13: W threatens to play R15).

I'd play H16: that is still a weak group!];W[mc]C[JMR
If the stones to the left of this were strong instead of weak, you could mount a devastating attack.]

(;B[ke]LB[le:a][me:b][oc:c][hd:d]C[JMR
This move seems a bit wishy-washy. Is it attacking, defending or making territory?

If the aim is to defend the B stones then I think D (H16) does it better.
To attack 72, A, B, or C does it better.
To make territory, C and D do it better. There is still territory around J17 that nobody is claiming.]
;W[me]C[JMR
Black is still well ahead on territory. He should therefore try and simplify, avoid complications or dangers.

W has 2 weak or weakish groups. Black should keep them separated.]

(;B[oc]C[JMR
Big move; but do you have the time?];W[lf]C[JMR
Good move: moves the weak stones out to the centre, defending them, and getting ready to make some territory in the centre, and attacking the weak B stones pushing them against the rock of 32 & 34 (F13 & G12).]
;B[kf]C[JMR
Remember, if you play in contact with stones, you strengthen them.]
;W[lh]C[JMR
Since B took the time to play 75 (P17) the W stones have moved out into the centre ahead of B, with the result that the B group is under severe attack. (Imagine a White play at J16). This serves to illustrate that the proverb that one should defend weak groups before attacking, and it looks as if the best response to 72 (N17) might have been H16, defending it immediately.]
;B[jh]C[JMR
If H16 were in place, it wouldn't be necessary to make a move like this, on a neutral point to defend this group, which is STILL not secure.  Your move at Q12 would be much more effective without white P12 in place.]
;W[oh]C[JMR
W has now linked up his weak stones, forming a strong group, and threatening to make a lot of territory in the middle, whilst B's upper side group is still not secure if W plays at J16.]

(;B[ph]C[JMR
Nice idea  for attacking.  How about O13 instead?  Not sure that attacking rather than just playing big moves is sound, when you are ahead.]
;W[pi];B[pg];W[og];B[oi];W[pj];B[oj];W[ok];B[mi];W[mh];B[mj]
C[JMR
81 onward. An interesting idea, consistently carried out - separating the W stones into 2 groups. Unfortunately the W stones were already rather strong on each side, whilst B is creating a weakish group (N10 etc), whilst he still has the unsettled group at the top. "Defend before attacking".

It is difficult to predict what is going to happen with 4 weak groups: blood is likely to be spilt!  Since you were ahead, a strategy of simplifying, whilst strengthening your groups, and reducing his territory is called for.]
;W[ki]C[JMR
Good move, separating the 2 weak black groups.];B[jk]C[JMR
Shapely, and offers help to both weak B groups; but might not the top B group die when W plays K11? Imagine W playing J16.]
;W[ji];B[ih];W[ii]
(;B[hi]C[JMR
I would be worried about the top group, and play as in the variation.]
;W[hh];B[hj];W[kk];B[ml];W[km];B[ol];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl]C[JMR
A natural-looking move, but it is easy to miss the fact the W must repair at Q9 after atari-ing B at P7. The W group does need looking after. How about Q8 instead, or S7?

It is hard to judge what should happen when there are 4 weak groups on the board!]
;B[nm];W[om];B[pl];W[mm];B[nn];W[pk];B[lm];W[mn];B[kl]C[JMR
At this point clearly all the B stones in the centre are strong, connected as they are to that capture at C9, and the W group on the right side is about to die.]
;W[kn]
(;B[kj]C[JMR
Don't think this is necessary. I'd play P6, and the W group on the right looks moribund.]
;W[ln];B[jn]C[Was this necessary?

JMR
This rescues the B group at the bottom, although B3 would make a huge difference territorially. Who's going to get it?]
;W[on]C[JMR

Defence against the tactical swindles will come with practice, and problem-solving. I would try and take in the message about being aware of the relative strengths of groups, and how they can change when things change nearby. And certainly "Don't approach thickness"!

But notice how effective the reduction of W's territory is; the reducing B group is well out into the centre, and not far off contribuing to the B moyo on the right; F16 still has a little utility (suppose B playsG15 or H16); the C6 group can be pressured, but is not really weak, as it has 1 1/2 eyes and access to the centre either at E9 or F6.

We will compare this situation to a later one in the game.]

Heavy and slow. Tenuki is best. Locally I prefer H16 for Black - faster and lighter.]

This is what I would play.  All Black's stones are working together towards forming a moyo.]
