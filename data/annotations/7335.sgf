C[[GV\] Hello, I am Gabriel, 15k EGF, played as white.
I ask for a review because I won the game, but I had a feeling that my oponent has more solid teritory and I often had to return and patch my shapes loosing sente. I have a bad habit not to count my teritory until the game is over. Sometimes I made few slow moves, but seems my oponent made them too, so if you point out why black lost, it will be helpful too

H: 
Hi, I am Hannes and I will review for white, mainly. 
Comments are marked with an "H"];B[pd]C[gusto2 [13k?\]: hi
bbbeza [13k\]: HI];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[dn]LB[co:B][do:A]C[[GV\] I waited D5, but this did not force me to complete a joseki

H: 

Yes, A and B are more common, and it's not clear what the black move aims at.]
;W[fp]C[H:

Simple, but good move. No need to defend the corner, nor to attack,]
;B[ck]LB[cp:A]C[H:

The bad thing about this black move is that white can easily get the corner at A. And black cannot ignore that move.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[jq]LB[no:A][jq:B][nq:C]C[H: 

Jumping to A would be the usual reaction. Because now, every white attack from the "B" side will put unwanted pressure on white C.]
;B[mo]
(;W[qq]LB[mp:B][nq:A]C[H:

Reasonable move. Go for the corner and maybe use the A stone later. 
Cutting the keima at B would have been a possible counter-attack, cf. the variation]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[pn]
(;W[qo]LB[qn:A]C[H:

Playing at A is possible, too. And may give white more influence to the right side. Cf. variation]
;B[qg];W[gc]C[H:

Very well. Settling the corners before engaging in attacks.]
;B[dg];W[mc]LB[cf:B][dh:C][ci:D][ek:E][co:A]C[H:

I am not sure about letting black build on the left. Moves A to E are possible reducing moves / attacks.]
;B[nc]
(;W[nd]LB[md:A]C[H: 
The following sequence turns out good for white. However, playing at A instead would have created bad shape for black, cf. variation.]
;B[oc];W[ld]LB[kc:B][md:A]C[H:

I like this move very much. Playing A seems appealing, but then a black Attack near B would make the white stones become unconnected and weak.]
;B[qk];W[qi]LB[og:A][qi:C][ok:B]TR[bf][cf][dh][ci][dj][ek][fn]
[co][cp]C[[GV\] W R11 should reduce black's solid side wall,
but I think B was too nice to me, Q11 would be more
severe

maybe I shoud play some forcing moves first (C4, B15), but I didn't know if this invasion will be late or not, I could play e.g. F6, L5 to extend my teritory, but I didn't like the black wall.

H: 
I agree that reducing the left moyo by playing on one of the marked points  would have been better.

And if you want to reduce black on the left side, you should have done this more lightly like at A or B. 

The C stone just creates a weak white group. If black attacks it properly, white will be fleeing while black creates territory or influence]
;B[og]C[H:

however, black doesn't];W[oi];B[lg]TR[mg]C[H:

no need for black to jump so far.];W[mi]C[H:

white does fine, here, of course];B[mk];W[ki];B[ne]TR[mg][ng]
C[H:

Not sure why black stops the attack. Perhaps because of the two space jump before?]
;W[me];B[cp]C[H:

Black must not stay away from the fight, here.];W[cq];B[dp]
;W[bq]C[H:

Sensible as black must respond...];B[pi]C[H:

which he doesn't];W[pj];B[ph];W[ok]C[H:

good sequence from white];B[ol];W[nk];B[nl];W[pk];B[ql];W[ii]
LB[qi:A]C[H:

very nice result for white (keeping in mind that everything started with a lonely stone at A.)

white is now running right into what could have become black's territory on the left]
;B[gi];W[jg]LB[jg:A][fh:D][gi:C][ek:E][jk:B]TR[bf][cf][an][fn]
[bo]C[H:

Nothing wrong here, but actually, white has both, A and B to strengthen his group. He does not need to respond immediately to black C.

The reducing moves marked with a triangle are still possible.

Plus some invasion around D or even E would be possible, too, as black is so loosely connected.]
;B[jk];W[je];B[hf];W[ie];B[ge];W[hd];B[cd]
(;W[ce]LB[cc:A]C[[GV\] I let B into the corner for exchange to reduce B teritory somewhere in the center

H: 

It's not corner vs. center, but corner vs. left side.

But frankly, I can't tell what would be better. personally, A would have been my choice. See variations.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[bg];W[ef];B[ci];W[dh]
;B[ff];W[eg];B[fg];W[fh];B[gh];W[cb]LB[cb:A][fh:B][ej:F][an:C]
[fn:E][bo:D]C[H:

Playing A (and perhaps even the move at B before) are not as big as C - E (or even F). These should be played first.]
;B[ad];W[an];B[bp];W[ap];B[bo];W[ao];B[bm];W[ko]LB[ej:B][fn:A]
C[H:

Again A would have been better as it does both, reduce black while building up potentially white territory

(Although it may be argued that with B as a potential move, this isn't black's territory any longer at all.)]
;B[jn]C[H:

not sure what black aims at, here.];W[ln];B[mm];W[mn];B[nn]

;W[iq];B[hp];W[hq];B[lp];W[gp];B[hn];W[fn]C[H:

finally :-)];B[go];W[fo];B[gn]C[[GV\] I think B failed to stop me here]
;W[fm];B[gl];W[el];B[dl];W[ek];B[fj];W[ej]LB[mb:F][nf:A][lg:B]
[qi:D][qj:C][rm:E]C[H:

It's tempting for white to run as far into black's land as possible, but black cannot make any points here, anyway. So other moves are more valuable, like A (threating to cut off B),  C (rescuing D), or E.]
;B[fi];W[eh];B[ei];W[di];B[dj]C[H:

Unneccessary];W[dk];B[cj];W[dm];B[cl];W[cm];B[cn];W[em];B[bn]
;W[bc]LB[bc:A]C[H:

A will make white loose sente. Play one of the other big moves first.]
;B[bd];W[bb];B[ch];W[ee];B[am];W[aq];B[mb];W[lb];B[nb];W[pr]
;B[or];W[qs];B[jr]LB[oq:A]C[H: 

Mistake. Connecting at A is a must (as white saw)

No comment on the following sequence, where black apparently lost focus]
;W[ir];B[kr];W[oq];B[nr];W[mr];B[lr];W[ns];B[np];W[op];B[mq]
;W[po];B[oo];W[os];B[qn];W[nf]C[H:

Good move. Just play it more early.];B[oe];W[ng];B[lj];W[li]
;B[nj];W[mj];B[ml];W[qj]C[H:

same here.

No more comments on the endgame. Just concentrate on playing moves first, that keep you in sente.
(It actually is: first those moves, where both get sente, then those where you keep sente, and black would get gote)]

H:

Having a look at the final board, white did a good job in leaving only one corner to black, and in reducing all other black groups to small territory.

However, remember that the A group started as a very weak stone that black was not able to attack in the right way. It must never have connected to the upper group, or at least, black must have gotten more profit from it.

It's not easy to give a final advise. In the end most of my comments boil down to what you will have heard many times before: Take your time to check whether the immediate reaction to your opponents move is really more important than playing in more distant (and more empty) places on the board. 

(Secondly, don't create weak groups yourself, but it seems like this is not a general pattern of your game)


Feel free to ask, if you have any additional question about the review.


Best,
