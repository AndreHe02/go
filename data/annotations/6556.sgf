C[Game was played without time controls, took about 150 min.
Thanks for reviewing!];B[ep];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[nc];W[qf]LB[cf:A]
[pf:B][kd:C]C[Donal: White 6 seems to be a bit low or overconcentrated on the right considering how high Black's position is. It's hard to know the best move, but I would consider for example A, B, or C, all of which are a little more balanced.]
;B[de];W[co]C[8 is a good move.];B[dn]LB[kp:A][cq:B][cl:C]C[Black 9 is in the worng direction. It would be a great move if there was already a black stone at A, but if White plays there first, Black's stone will be useless. So instead, play B, A, or C.]
;W[cq]LB[cn:A][dm:B]C[Before playing 10, White should perhaps exchange White A, Black B first, and then 10. But this is still a success for White.]
;B[eq]LB[dq:A][cr:B][jq:C]C[Black 11 is solid, but there's no time to play like this right now. He should play Black A, White B, Black C.]
;W[cn];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl]C[This was no joseki, but seems balanced to us.

Donal: Locally it's reasonable, but there's no extension from Black's wall, so since it's White's turn, this is no good for Black.]
;W[kq]C[With White 16, Black's wall is neutralized. Black's strategy has failed.]
;B[jp]LB[qn:A][jd:B][cl:C]C[Black tries to make something with his wall, but this extension is too narrow. He should just play somewhere else, like A, B, or C.]
;W[ko]LB[jq:A][kp:B][jd:C][qp:D]C[White is being too greedy. He doesn't want Black to get anything from his wall, but that is unreasonable. He has to choose A or B. Black should now push through at B, and when White blocks he can play at A with sente. Black can then play C, and can later play at D.]
;B[qn];W[kd]LB[qp:A][qq:B][pq:C]C[thoughts on this move? should w have addressed lower left

Donal: Of course White 20 is big. But playing at the lower right seems urgent. Next Black can attach at A, and if B, then cut at C.]
;B[np];W[pn];B[kp];W[lp]
(;B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[mp];B[pm];W[on];B[ql]LB[qq:A]C[Normally instead of 31, Black would want to play at A. If this stone can't live, it means Black's cut at 25 was no good because it gave White too much corner territory.]
;W[jq];B[qq];W[pq]LB[qo:A]C[White 34 is too easy-going. Even without all the extra stones he has, it's better to play at A instead. In this case he should be trying to kill Black in the corner, and also attack him on the right side.]
;B[qp]C[White was probably thinking of a handicap-game joseki he has seen when he played at 34. This is rarely played in even games because it is favorable for Black.]
;W[ip]LB[qo:A]C[Before 36, White should probably play A with sente.]
;B[jo]LB[di:A][cl:B]C[Black shouldn't run away as it just gets him into trouble. Actually Black needs to worry about White playing at A, which attacks his group on the lower left. Playing there himself would be prudent. Even blocking at B is probably an overplay.]
;W[kn];B[mn]C[Black is just making it worse and worse. There is nothing to be achieved here.]
;W[km];B[nn];W[no];B[om];W[in]C[Black's last few moves haven't accomplished anything. White's capture at 44 is a big success for him.]

(;B[mf]LB[di:A][ic:B]C[Black 45 is a nice move, but he is still vulnerable to White A, especially now that White has become thick on the lower side. If Black thinks that defending at A is too slow, he should at least play at B, which supports Black's weakness on the left and treats black 5 lightly.]
;W[mc]LB[oc:A][nd:B][kf:C][mh:D][kh:E][mj:F][di:G]C[any better moves for w instead of this?

Donal: White A is best. This defends the corner and attacks Black. If black B, then white C chases Black. Black can escape to his stones below, but just connecting has no value for him. Meanwhile White is erasing Black's influence in the center. White G becomes a deadly attack on the Black group. This is all made possible by White's thick capture of three stones.]
;B[oc];W[pc];B[oe]LB[nd:A]C[Black 47 should just be at A. Then he can invade the corner later. 47 was not sente, as Black had to come back to 49 anyway. The exchange of 46 for A is a big loss for White.]
;W[hc]LB[kf:B]C[perhaps j17 is better

Donal: This move is just fine, but B is better as explained previously.]
;B[jc]LB[di:A][lg:B][pg:C]C[Black's invasion seems OK when just looking at the local position. But Black needs to realize that he has a very weak group on the lower left, and that his group on the  upper right is a little precarious also. He needs to address these problems somehow.  A is the obvious choice. He could also consider B or C. In view of the overall position, Black 51 is an overplay.]
;W[jd];B[ic];W[id];B[hb]
(;W[gb]C[Here, White should not be trying to stop Black from connecting to the left, since he can't do it anyway. He should try to make thickness in the center and put it to work somehow (see diagram.)]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[ib];W[fc];B[gd]C[White 60 is in the wrong direction. There is no urgent need to stop Black from connecting to the left. The center is more important. After Black's strong play at 59, White is unable to save his stone at 56.]
;W[fd];B[ge];W[fb]
(;B[lc]C[Black 65 can be cut off. So he should play A instead. (See diagram.)]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[lb];B[ld]
(;W[ka]LB[mb:A]C[could W have done better than ko here, or did B miss a clean connection?

Donal: White doesn't need to play ko with 70. Instead he can play White A and capture Black, but Black becomes thick on the outside (see diagram.)

White doesn't really have good ko threats. When you consider that it only became ko when Black made a mistake, you can see that White should never have tried escaping at 60.]
;B[ja];W[jb];B[io];W[ho];B[kb];W[fe];B[gf];W[jb];B[bp];W[cp]
;B[kb];W[la];B[mb];W[jb];B[qe]LB[ek:B]C[better ko threats for B? possibly B3. seems like W has to ignore almost anything and take the ko here

Donal: This ko threat is plenty big. Black should be glad that White ignored it, because White still has threats like B. If White was going to end up like this, he shouldn't have played the ko at all.]
;W[md];B[le];W[ia];B[pe]
(;W[nk]C[White 90 is awfully thin, but White probably feels he has to take chances like this to win now. Actually, White has a move to live in the upper right corner (see diagram.) Of course, the question is when he should do that.]
;B[ml]C[should B have protected territory, p10 maybe?

91 seems like such a good point that it would be a shame to let White play there. And White 90 seems like an overplay, so it's better to respond more positively.]
;W[lj];B[mk];W[mj]
(;B[nj]C[Cutting at 95 leads to a poor result for Black. See the diagram for a better way.]
;W[ni];B[oj];W[oi];B[kk]LB[pj:A][kj:B][jk:C]C[Having cut, Black must follow up by extending at A. Letting White atari is terrible. Since he can't capture White's group, coming out at 99 doesn't help. If white B, black C, Black is just playing profitless neutral points.]
;W[pj];B[ok];W[pk];B[ol];W[cg];B[cd]LB[lh:A][dg:B][dh:C][cf:D]
C[Since White ignored black 99, Black should try to get sente and follow up with an attack at A. So instead of Black 105, which is solid but gote, he should play at B, and if white C, then black D.]
;W[cl]
(;B[ej]LB[dk:A][di:B]C[With white 106, the black group is completely adrift. Black runs away with 107, but this is a very thin shape. Extending at A invites an attack at B though. For a bold counterattack, see the diagram.]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[dj]LB[fm:A]C[White 110 missed a great chance to play at A.]
;B[gm];W[ii]LB[di:A][ci:B][dh:C][ch:D][dg:E]C[ear reddening?

Donal: White 112 is a nice move. Because Black insisted on saving his stones on the left, he lost his chance to attack White on the right. His attemps to attack now don't do very much. Black should now play just play black A, white B, black C, white D, black E to connect.

A theme much repeated in this game: miss your chance to play the vital point, and after your opponent plays there, try to get the same result you would have gotten even though it is too late. It's better to change course.]

;B[hm];W[ih];B[fh]C[secures connection while threatening c11, but W think q11 cut is bigger

Donal: Black has to play here or risk being killed. (See diagram.) Or he can give up two stones, but it gets complicated (see diagram.)

Summing up this game, Black 9, making a wall but then allowing White to erase it with 16 was the biggest problem. The other thing that stands out is that both players are playing difficult moves where the consequences are unpredictable. It's far better to play simpler moves where you know exactly how it will turn out, even if it doesn't seem as powerful or exciting.

Try to understand the "worst case" in each situation, and know what you are guranteed to get regardless of what your opponent does. If your move gives some wonderful result if your opponent plays in a particular way, you are probably only imagining that he will play there. I think that both players are constantly getting results that don't live up to the expectations they had a few moves earlier.

The best way to learn from this is to back over your game records, and see which of your moves actually worked, and which ones failed. Maybe the failed ones were more complicated than it was worth?

C[Perhaps Black could cut at 1, and then when White cuts at 10, he could give up two stones? But if Black ends in gote on the left, he could get into trouble on the right when White lives in the corner. He has to scramble for eyes for his own group on the right. The cut at 1 hardly seems worth it.]

To discover plays like this, you need to change your way of thinking. Naturally it is good to cut your opponent off in many cases, and good to connect in many cases. But cutting and connecting take no profit in themselves because they are plays on neutral points. Often it is better to force your opponent to connect along neutral points while taking profit for yourself.]
