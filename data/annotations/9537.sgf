C[Hello,

I identified two main problems with your playing style that lead to a whole host of other problems, so we will be focusin on those.  

1. Playing small moves 
2. Ignoring Gote/Sente

I think a lot of your small moves aree motivteed by fear.  Your opponent moves somewhere close to your group and you are not sure if your group is safe or not and you make a safety move just in case.  That is bad form.  Read out the situation as best as you can, and if you don't see any danger, then play elsewhere.  If you were wrong and that group gets in trouble or dies, it is a great learning situation.  Go back and see why your group was in trouble.  

As far as sente/gote, I can not overstress how important this concept is.  Before you make every move, check to see if it is sente or gote.  If it is gote, try your best to find a sente move.  Sente moves are worth twice as much as gote moves, so every time you take gote when you don't have too, you are practically giving your opponent a free move.

Onward to the specifics!]PL[B];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo]
;W[jq];B[pj]C[I assume this move was too defensive?

This move is totally fine.  It is less aggressive than some would play, but this entire game was very peaceful.  Not an invasion or fight in the whole game.  Sometimes that is fine, but you do need to keep a good count on who has more territory.  Peaceful games can be harder because it can be difficult to tell who is winning.]
;W[nc];B[pg]LB[pf:B][qf:A]C[also too defensive? what would have been better? to split with f.ex. k17 or k16, or to defend the corner?

This move is also OK, but A or B are more common.  Note that the stone you played and B do not help protect the corner at all.]
;W[jd]C[since he played k16 now, I assume I should've played around there myself.

Again, W and B are pretty even here.];B[dj]LB[cf:A][ci:D][cj:C]
[ck:E][cn:B]C[Good idea.  I would probably haave played on the third line somewhere, as it makes getting a base easier, but this workss too, especially since you have good influence on the right side.

Letters are other good options.];W[cn];B[ce]C[I wasn't sure about this move

For good reason.  This move is very bad.  Better to do  a normal approach.  You are basically "shoulder-hiting" yourself.  Ass soon as W replies at C16, B's move looks awful.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[be];W[de];B[cg];W[ck];B[cj];W[bk];B[bj]
LB[pb:B][jo:D][dq:A][lq:C]C[the whole time, even before this move, I was thinking about playing something like G3, but I wasn't sure if it would be a good idea, so...


G3 is not so good, but playing away is definitely better.  This is one of those slow moves.  It protects a few small points of territory when you could be breaking up W's framework.

I marked a few alternatives.  "B" helps prepare o invade aat M17.]
;W[jn]LB[dq:B][jr:A]TR[nc][jd]C[... once he played this move I realized that I was in trouble. either way, at this point I wasn't sure how to respond properly


Ths is a tricky spot.  You might try an invasion into W's influence.  Something like "a" or "b".  You could also go after W 's marked thin stones on top.  The big thing is to get W to respond to you and get some momentum going.]
;B[mq]C[this felt like an important response to me, but it's probably not urgent and too defensive?


Yes.  This is a bit slow.];W[mo];B[pm]C[This is also slow.  Here you are trying to solidify your territory, but leaving an open door for W to make much more.]
;W[nf]
(;B[ob];W[nb];B[oc]C[Because you need this move, the whole sequence is gote.]
;W[nh];B[nj];W[ij]C[I didn't like this move either. it seems fairly big, with the potential to go both upwards and downwards, so I once again wasn't sure how to respond to it.

This game is already difficult for B.  Your best chance is to try and start a fight.  Make things comlicated.  A good way to do that is by attaching to  a W stone.]
;B[li];W[ek];B[eh]C[Way slow.  This move does almost noting and is completely gote to boot.]

;W[km];B[ll];W[jl];B[kr];W[jr]C[bettter to stop here and make some other sente moves.  When you defend at L3, it becomes gote.]
;B[kq];W[kp];B[oo];W[eq]C[Now invasion is doomed to fail if W responds correctly.]

(;B[cf];W[dg];B[dh];W[mi]C[This cut threatens nothing.  Let him make it and take something bigger.]
;B[mj];W[lh];B[ki]C[This does nothing in Gote .  D12 is already alive, and W can still cut you.]

Also, W threatens nothing here.];W[fk]C[he seemed to have seen it and played it therefore himself]
