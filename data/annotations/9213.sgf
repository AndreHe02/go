C[Nico: Hello, I am Nicol√°s Kuschinski, from Mexico, KGS 2 dan.

I will be reviewing this game. My comments begin with an N:

N: In answer to your question about the game, I think the issue is mostly one of balance. There comes a point when you seem to think you are behind (even though you are not) and you play moves that seem like acts of desperation. I think if you keep your cool and take your time to actually study the position carefully, you will realize that you do not have to play reckless and desperate moves.]
;B[pp]C[JP1955 [4k\]: gg
Beard [3k\]: hi, gg];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[ip]C[N: This move is unusual. Your response is correct.]
;W[eq]C[Beard [3k\]: I played e3 to force the non optimal 2 space extension for black]
;B[fp];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pg]TR[oc][nd]C[N: The two space extension here is particularly odd, especially after the marked exchange. There is a lot of aji in black's corner. See the variation for an example.]

(;W[jd]C[Beard [3k\]: I think this far white is doing ok
N: This position is clearly good for white. The contrast of the upper right and lower left corners is striking.]
;B[ec]C[Beard [3k\]: strange approach.. no idea what to reply
N: Agreed, this is a strange move.];W[dc]C[N: This reply is fine.]
;B[hc]
(;W[ic]C[N: This is the first white move that is bad, see variation for a better option.]
;B[hd]LB[db:B][fb:D][ib:C][kc:A]C[N: In contrast to the variation, black still has the aji of an invasion at A, is in a better position to run to the center, and maybe can even fight to make eyes right here with combinations of moves like B C and D.]
;W[eb]TR[if]C[Beard [3k\]: taking away the base

N: While the prospect of attacking here is, of course, very tempting, white is very strong on the left side, and not quite so strong on the right. Although it is softer as an attack, I would prefer to play something around J14 (marked) since it helps to fix white's own problems as well as putting pressure on black.]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[fb];W[db];B[fe];W[ff];B[ge];W[fg]LB[ef:A]C[Beard [3k\]: at this point i was feeling really good

N: I agree that white is doing well BUT I think this move is not very good. It is the sort of move that white would make if black had just played G14, but in this case, black did not play there. Instead of this move why not just connect simply at A?

See the variation for some issues that remain because of the aji of this cut]

(;B[ld]C[N: Because of the ugly move at J17, this kind of strongarm tactics is available to black, but I think it might be a bit early to try this.]

(;W[lc];B[mc];W[mb];B[kc];W[lb]C[N: Capturing is better, obviously.]
;B[kd];W[kb];B[jc];W[ob]C[N: This exchange helps black fix the aji in his corner.]
;B[pb];W[od]C[N: And this one is even worse, as it is not even clear what white gains from this atari.]
;B[pc];W[md];B[jb];W[na]LB[qe:A]TR[ob][pb]SQ[pc][od]C[Beard [3k\]: the upper side seems to be a total mess for both sides :)

N: This is true. J17 is primarily to blame for this, since white had nice attacking prospects.

N: Of note: it may be debatable whether this move is slow. I think it is fine, since white has enough of a territorial lead that he can afford to slow down and play some honte.

N: Also of note: even though the marked exchanges helped black to fix some of his aji, the corner is still not clean. There are still many ways to make a mess if you play at A, for example.]
;B[dj]LB[ch:B][ck:A]C[N: As black I would have considered D15 directly at this point.

N (again): It seems to me, after reading some of your later commentary, that you thik black here is invading your territory. This is not true. The left side is not territory yet.  We can see that between points A and B, black can place a standard two space extension with two spaces of freedom on each side, and also center access. If there is this much empty space, and also access to the center, I would not even think about calling the area territory. I don't think it is even a moyo.]
;W[dh]TR[de]C[Beard [3k\]: is this the correct way to attack? wanted to prevent black extension

N: Unfortunately, you have to defend the upper side. You must play this way to fix the aji at D15. If you had played E14 instead of the strange move at F13, you would be in a position to either ignore black or play a stronger move like E8.]
;B[bi]TR[em]C[N: What a strange move! Black must still be thinking about the aji at D15, but it would be much more normal to play something like E7.]
;W[bh]C[N: White's territory becomes very large.];B[ci];W[ch]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[cm];W[dm];B[dl];W[el];B[em];W[dn];B[dk]C[Beard [3k\]: black managed to live small in gote.. i think this is still ok for white though I lost lot of points of course

N: You did NOT lose any points! The area in which black lived was not anyone's territory. In the process of making him live small your territory on the left grew. This result is actually pretty bad for black and the territorial gap has only widened.]
;W[qp]LB[qe:A][qg:C][qi:B][qn:1]TR[ip]SQ[kq][nq]C[Beard [3k\]: Now things started to really strong.. The black moyo was getting very scary, but I was not sure how to invade / reduce. 3-3 point would have given black even more thickness

N: THIS IS THE KEY MOMENT in the game where your notion of what is going on seems very skewed:

N: You say "The black moyo was getting very scary" but I do not see any black moyo on the board. The bottom cannot be considered a moyo because the triangle stone is extremely close to the F3 stones, hence the position is actually overconcentrated and very hard to develop efficiently. Also note that you can fit a standard two space extension (marked with squares) into this area: There is nothing to worry about.

If you mean the right side, then this is also not a moyo if only because Q13 is so far away ( There are other reasons, explained below).

Furthermore, you say the black moyo "was getting very scary" but if we look at black's previous moves, they were all just moves to live on the left side. None of them were related to expanding the bottom or the right side!

All in all, R3 is the sort of move to play when black is very strong in this area and you are merely trying to make shape. Black is NOT very strong in this area. Not even close.

A standard approach at R6 (1) would be an OK move if you must play in this area, but if I was playing this game I would be thinking about the aji at A at this moment. Depending on your style you could even consider playing A directly, although I would probably try something a bit softer. Seeing how far ahead you are, you might even consider a very timid move like B, to force C before extending down the right side. Black cannot turn the bottom into territory in one move (or even in two) so you can safely ignore it for now.]
;B[qq];W[qo];B[rq]C[N: Black starts out with some scattered stones at the bottom, but you actually forced him to make shape and points here. He had neither.]
;W[po];B[op];W[pk]C[N: Why high? The normal move is R9.];B[pm]
TR[qm]C[N: This seems like an overplay, but actually, white is still ahead in territory. It is probably OK to just respond at the triangle point and let black get away with it.]
;W[oo]C[Beard [3k\]: this was probably stupid.. should have connected

N: This move is OK also, but it makes the position complex, and you are ahead. You usually only want to complicate when you are behind.]
;B[pl];W[np]C[N: This is an easy oversight to make. I may well have carelessly played this move myself, but actually the cutting point is serious and black takes advantage of this overplay to good effect.]
;B[no];W[nq];B[pq];W[nn];B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[ol]C[N: At this point, in only a few moves, white has managed to turn a won game into something extremely complex. It is still perfectly winnable, but it is very hard.

Although we could go back to moves 62-77 and discuss the finer points of each one, I think this  would only distract us from the real issue: White was winning. White had more territory, more thickness, more points, and stronger groups. Black had no territory to speak of. No moyo, and at least one terrible aji problem at R15.

Rather than taking your time to appraise the situation, however, you saw a few scattered black stones, called it a "moyo", and got scared. The moves that started with R4 look like you are desperately trying to make shape against overwhelming black thickness. The black thickness that you were upset by was completely imaginary. Playing the normal moves would work just fine, and you would have cruised your way through to victory.]
;B[qk];W[qj];B[ok];W[pj];B[om];W[nl];B[nm];W[mm];B[ml];W[nk]
LB[qe:A]TR[pj][qj]C[Beard [3k\]: ok.. white really screwed up this whole thing, but event without it, and even though white seemed (to me) play a nice early game, black was suddenly dominating completely

N: The fight is actually still very messy. I think the game remains playable for white, although it is now a bit of an uphill battle. The marked stones have  a significant effect on A (previously mentioned), and you can try to fight back (this time it is a good idea to make it confusing!)]
;B[mk];W[nj];B[on];W[rk];B[qm];W[kn]C[N: Looking at this complicated fight was not what was requested in this review, (thank god! This part is very hard!) so I will not go into details.]

(;B[rp];W[sn];B[de]C[N: Note that this ko threat would not be available if white had played E14 instead of F13, as previously suggested.]
;W[pn];B[ef]
(;W[ce]C[ N: See variation for an alternative to this move.]
;B[cf];W[be];B[bf];W[bc];B[gi];W[fi];B[fj];W[gj]C[Beard [3k\]: somehow at this point white had completely lost the game.. even though the battle at bottom right corner was a disaster, I dont think that was the main problem
Beard [3k\]: There seems to be something terribly wrong with my late fuseki/early middle game
Beard [3k\]: After this the game was not very interesting on my part: i managed to win because of few tactical blunders by my opponent, but I dont feel like i deserved to win from this position.
Beard [3k\]: Why I wanted this game to be reviewed is that I have now had several games like this in a row, and I can't figure how I end up in this mess :)

N: The bottom right corner was absolutely the problem, but not in the way you think. The issue was not so much tactical details of how to fight properly, so much as the whole idea of starting that fight to begin with. Commentary ends here.
