C[yeech [7k\]: yo

My opponent played teritorily and tenukied several times I wasn't sure if I could attack any of them severely. In the end he got two groups killed which I thought he could live with one if he had lived with the center one the game would have been close if you notice any ways I could attack more severely please let me know]

(;W[qe]C[GUS: This is almost never a good move. It strengthens black. In this case you are building a wall facing a black stone... not a good strategy.]

black resigns because the group in the center is dead I'm assuming?

GUS: Except i'ts not... certainly not clear. Probably he had to go somewhere. Assuming the black group lives (probably in gote). The entire game rests on the fate fo the group at the top]
