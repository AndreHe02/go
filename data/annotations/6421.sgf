AB[pd][dp]C[Zamoth : Hello my name is Thomas (aka Zamoth) and I live in France.  I'm about 3~4 kyu on KGS and I will try my best on this review.

The Best practice says that on a two stone Game, white must play as usual, and try to gain points, step by step.  My first read of the game gave me the feeling that white lost only because he played too easly on the opening.

I just finished my review, and I have to say I will not talk much about black, because he played well the opening, and the first moves of the middle game.  He made mistakes only after that.
--------
This is a game between myself (Mark - 8k? on KGS) and Peter (playing black and 12k? on KGS).  I'm most interested in problems with my opening (I did not think I had sente through much of the early game), but any comments for either side would be appreciated.]
;W[pq];B[dc];W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[dg];B[fc];W[cj]LB[ck:A]
C[Mark: A pretty standard joseki.  I don't know if another would be better given the two stone handicap.
--------
Zam : Joseki says you could play at A, but this shape si solid, and prepares to attacking later on.]
;B[qo];W[op]C[Mark: Again, I don't know if this joseki is appropriate (and I don't follow the joseki choice that's in the alternative from _38 Basic Joseki_).
--------
Zam : I read this book twice, but I can't remeber much.  Don't focus on Josekis. This play is fine, as black does not know them too.]
;B[pm]
(;W[lq];B[hq]
(;W[qf]C[Zam : This move may only lead to a pincer.  Black takes the opportunity.
Why not play on the other side, it is wider ... and gives more possibilities.]
;B[qi];W[of]C[Mark: I've since learned this is not joseki (that a better choice is to move to the 3-3).  However, I'm concerned about giving B a chance to build walls in either direction.

Zam : I think it's just the pincer which is not usual.];B[nd]
;W[mf]LB[rd:B][qi:A]C[Zam : This is the first slow move.  It does not give any way to attack the lonly stone @ A and allows top stones to fortify.  Black takes the chance.
Black would not have played like that if you had played on the other side (see the other branch)

Any way, I would rather stabilize my group first playing at B]

(;B[qe]
(;W[pe]C[Zam : I don't like this move.  See the other branch]
;B[re];W[rf];B[pg]
(;W[pf];B[qc]C[Zam : Good moves for black.  White is heavy, all black groups are secure, black has made some territories.  So far, black is leading.  White has to do something !  But what ?
top left is secure
top right is secure
bottom is safe
right is safe];W[cn];B[cp];W[en]C[Zam : those 2 white move seems territorial.  But white is behind black, so he had to do something more agressive !]
;B[fo];W[gp]C[Mark: Somewhat of a desperation move --- I appear to have yielded the corner too quickly and I want to somehow break up B's stones.

Zam : It is a useless move];B[fq];W[ld]LB[ic:A][kc:B]C[Zam : White group is strong ... even if it does not have an eye yet.  He can make one easily on the bottom, and he is escaping to the center easily.  The top is till open, so why not play A or B maybe ?]
;B[jd];W[oc]C[Zam :  this does not kill Black, it can not connect to P14, it has no place to make eyes.  It is a very bad move]
;B[od];W[mb]C[Mark: Throughout the game, I keep on thinking this B group is vunerable --- thus the surrounding moves.]
;B[hc]C[Zam : This move is kind of slow but it makes some points, strenthen K16, so weakens your attack. I guess it is an honest move. 
I would have played S3 or around C8 I guess];W[gq]C[Zam : second white very slow move]
;B[gr];W[fp];B[eq];W[go];B[cl]
(;W[fn]C[Mark: I'm guessing a capping move would be better here.

Zam : The capping move is not really capping as black may connect.
I would have blocked at A]
(;B[ef]C[Zam : Black should continue on playing the stone he just played]

Zam : You have not read enough.  Black is safe since he can connect.  See variation]

;W[fm];B[ik];W[mk]C[Mark: I think this move is a mistake.  My thought was to prevent B from running to the right and set up an invasion on the right, but I don't think this is the move to do it.

Zam : This stone is so lonely just in a middle of two strong groups.]
