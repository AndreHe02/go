C[I was told by a 3 dan, that one of the best responses to a tengen opening was a series of 3-3's.

The idea being that tengen wants to fight, and by playing solidly, I should be able to attack on all four sides.  I followed that strategy here, but failed miserably...

Hi my name is zamoth (Thomas) I'm actually 2k on KGS, and I'll do my best to comment this game.
After have watched quickly through the game, I guess you lost it only because you did not connect on some fights ... The global playing was not bad.
Let's go on ...];B[jj]C[pooishness [9k\]: hi, gg.

Now white has two weak groups.
Black now has to think : Do I save my two stones on the top.  Being black, I'll abandon them and prospect somewhere else.]

Those 2 white stones can be abandonned ... But getting strengh in the center might be good.  I like attaking black stones better]
