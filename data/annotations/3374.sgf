R: Hi, i hope mi review will be helpful
all my comments are marked with an R:
For any question you can find me on KGS as Wiles];B[pp];W[pc]
;B[cp];W[dd];B[ip];W[dm];B[dj];W[ch];B[eq];W[fm];B[fj];W[pn]
C[R: this is strange
W should defend on the left first];B[np];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[rq]
;W[qi];B[pj]C[R: Attacking on the left is more urgent
There are many ways to reduce the right side even if W add another stone, so it is not so important to playt here now]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[ql];B[pf];W[qe];B[fd];W[df]
(;B[eb]C[R: why not D17 here?];W[cb];B[jc];W[mc];B[ol]SQ[je]
[fg]C[What do you think about this move ?
I feel that black is now very good, do you think so ?

R: what is the point of this move?
Is B tryng to make territory in the centre?
The 4 B stones on the right are thin so you cannot think of them as thickness.
Since B has let W make real territory on the left and right, he shoud find some compensation attacking W on the left]
;W[fh]
(;B[gl]C[I want to attack the two white stones.
but is there any other better place for black to play ?];W[gn]
;B[il];W[gp]
(;B[gq]C[R: this just help white, playing  more solidily was probabily better]
;W[hq];B[fq];W[hp];B[jr];W[io];B[jp];W[in];B[cl]C[I start to have a wish to capture them.

R: W has already one eye and good eye shape so thinking of kill hi is hoping for too much]
;W[mn]C[this move seems meaningless.

R: I agree];B[ln];W[lo];B[mo];W[lm];B[kn];W[no]
(;B[lp]C[R: I don understand why you didn't played N4];W[mp]
;B[ko];W[mq];B[jm]C[it seems that white cannot escape now.

R: but you have lost many points at the bottom and it seems that W can still live with E5]

(;W[pq]
(;B[pr]C[R: Why not P3?];W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[rr];W[os];B[qs]
C[R: being forced to live so small where once was B territory is obviously bad, so even if B capture the left W stones is gain is not so big]
;W[je];B[eh];W[ei];B[fi];W[dh];B[ej];W[eg]C[R: What was the point of this last sequence? you just gave W a ponnuki which greatly weaked your top stones 
For exemple they're vulnerable to a W play at J17];B[eo]C[I think this should kill the white group.]

(;W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[I defend here because I am afraid of this stone may somehow connect to the white group.]
;W[bp];B[cr];W[bq];B[co];W[br]
(;B[cs]C[R: absolutely bad, now B1 is sente for W so he can live in the corner]
;W[bs];B[er];W[es];B[dr];W[bo];B[bn];W[cn];B[dn];W[cm];B[bm]
;W[en];B[do];W[ao];B[hr];W[hk];B[hl]C[I let white takes the top region.

R: now B is losing, 
W managed to keep the damage to a very minimum

B has more than 50 points at the bottom, but that is all
He his weak in all the other part of the board while W is rock-solid and has real territory on the left and Right]
;W[gk];B[fk];W[dl];B[ck];W[fl];B[el];W[fo];B[gm];W[jk]TR[pf]
[pi][pj][ol]SQ[dl][fl][cm][dm][fm][cn][en][gn][in][fo][io][gp]
[hp][hq]C[although I killed the bottom left white group, the white has built up influence on the top right corner, and the four black stones are in danger. Therefore I feel that I should not kill the white stones at the beginning. What do you think ?]
;B[kl]C[I decide to save the black stones...

R: Good idea, but i don't understand the move
This doesn't link your right stones to safety nor make eye-shape for them, so i don see how you're helping them]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[kk]C[R: W should have played N8 instead, this is a real gift to B this way it is too easy]
;B[ml];W[ik]C[R: another poor move by W
these stones are not important, since they're not making any territory nor are useful to attack, so we can safely say that w has just passed with his last two moves...]
;B[nj]C[now, which one is better, black or white ?

R: B has saved his right stones without suffering any damage, but the top stones are still weak, W can win this game only if he can exploit this weakness now]
;W[pk]C[R: too small, B shoul just take the opportuniny to play J16 and fix his last weak point]
;B[ok];W[nm];B[mk];W[ph];B[kd]C[What do you think about this move ?
In fact I don't know where is the largest place to invade.]
;W[ke];B[qd]C[so I test for white's response.];W[pd];B[qc];W[pe]
C[R: this is solid but maybe a little slack, S15 would have made things more difficult for Black]
;B[ld];W[le];B[md];W[ne];B[nc];W[nd];B[pb];W[ob];B[rb]
(;W[rd]C[R: W shold play ko at Q19 instead lettind B live this way is a big loss]
;B[rc];W[se];B[pa];W[ra];B[qa];W[oa];B[sa];W[lb];B[nb];W[na]
;B[oc];W[ma];B[lc];W[mb];B[kb];W[od]C[so the former black's moves seem stupid ?

R: well L18 help your top stones and you played it sente
since you also lived in the top right corner we see that W has lost a lot since our last analysis]
;B[li]C[maybe I should play here earlier ?];W[hi];B[ji];W[hd]

(;B[mf]C[R: you lost a golden opportunity here, the cut at N15 works]
;W[me];B[lf]C[R: too small, defending at K16 was bigger, since W can kill the top group (see var), luckly for you he didn't noticed it ;)

After that B is leading by a few points, but you lost some points in the yose to make it close to 1,5 pont]

R: there is still P4... lukily for you B wins anyway or it would be really a bad thing ;)

Do you find any serious mistakes in my game ?

Thanks !
