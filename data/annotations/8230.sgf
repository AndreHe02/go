C[First of all, thank you for taking the time to help and review my game.

About me (Black): I have been playing for a few months. In general, I have been told that I play too timidly. Although I think this is because I have difficulty finding a place to attack. I also often find myself with this huge territory that I have difficulty defending. This game is an example of that.

I would appreciate any comments you might have that could help. :)

-----
Hi,
I'll review for both sides, because the GTL and you say, that I should review for Black, but the comments are allways asking what White should do.

First I want to give a small summary.

Black:

IMPORTANT STONES: You don't have to safe every stone and every group. In some cases it is better to sacrifice two or three stones (sometimes even more) and you still get a better result. Generally speaking cutting stones are important stones. So if your stones divide your opponent in two groups and at least on of this group is weak, then it is often worth rescuing the cutting stones. Otherwise don't try to safe the stones.

ATTACKING: Don't attack if your own groups are weak. You tend to attack everything and everywhere, creating a lot of weak groups. Allthough the attitude in general is good (trying to attack your opponent), you should also take care of your own stones. For example you should finish josekis.

White:

What I said about IMPORTANT STONES above, also applies to your play.

ATTACKING: I share the opinion, that some of your moves are very timidly. Especially if you have a big wall and a lot of stones, you don't need to worry so much about peeps or cuts.
Do not just look from your perspective. Also look from the perspective of your opponent. Maybe one of your groups is not superstrong, but as long as the stones of your opponent are less strong, you don't have to worry.]
;B[pd]C[Sumatakyo [12k\]: hi gg
Arthus [13k\]: hi];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[nq]LB[qp:A]TR[pp]C[I was surprised by o3. I don't think shimari is a common opening move.

[F\]: You are right, the small or big knight's move is more common with the triangled stone at A. Anyway, in the double digit kyu area this kind of move is not the losing move of the game.]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[lc:B][pf:A]C[[F\]: This move is not good, because it strengthens White.
Black should play A or pincer at B.];W[nd]C[[F\]: "The only move." Good.]
;B[kc]LB[nf:B][pf:A]C[[F\]: This kind of attack is premature. Black should play at A. White can simply jump out at B (see variation).]
(;W[pe];B[ob]LB[qe:A]C[Black didn't follow joseki here. I was expecting R15 and wasn't sure what to do, so I made an iron pilar.

[F\]: To connect ones stones is always a good idea. I think in this case, White could also play at A.]
(;W[oe];B[qd];W[qe];B[rd];W[qn]LB[qh:B][qk:A]TR[ne][oe][pe]
[qe]C[Black pincers me next, which I should have expected. Would R8 have been better? If black had simply played K4 I was planning on playing R9 (hiraki).

[F\]: A rule of thumb is, that the extension from a wall is wall height plus one. In this case it would be A.
Black could also invade at B.]
(;B[ql]LB[on:A]C[[F\]: This is a good counter attack, because Black already has two stones in the corner. White's extension is to far away from the wall.
White should simply jump out at A.];W[qj];B[om];W[qq]LB[gq:A]
C[[F\]: Possibility to go into the corner is not a good idea and can be left open for later. White could limit Black's influence by playing at A.]
;B[qp];W[rp]LB[ro:A]C[[F\]: Black can also play at A.]
(;B[pq];W[rr];B[qr];W[rq];B[ps];W[rs];B[rn];W[ro];B[rm];W[so]
LB[fq:A]C[[F\]: White lives in gote, because Black can tenuki. Living in the corner was a bad idea, because White got only four points. Black is very thick on the outside. Black should continue at A.]
;B[qo]C[[F\]: This move is not necessary.];W[pl]LB[pm:B][gq:A]
C[I don't seem to read black very well.I was hoping he would block inward, but he blocked outward at q9. Would P9 have been better?

[F\]: At this point White should wait a moment and take a deep breath to analyze the situation.
On the left side, there are only White stones. So this is generally speaking a good area to develop. In the top right corner White has some influence, Black has some territory. Locally it seems balanced.
In the bottom right White has a very small corner and Black has huge influence.
So a good move for White would be one, that develops the left side while limiting Blacks influence in the bottom right. 'A' is such a move.
Even if Black answers as expected at B, White doesn't accomplish very much.]
(;B[pk]
(;W[ol]C[[F\]: This move is making things worse. White shouldn't play in an area where Black is strong. The White stones are also not important.]
;B[pm];W[qk]LB[nl:A]C[I was hoping Black would go for the white stone or play elsewhere. I don't like how this is turning out, it seems to be because of my bad move at Q8 earlier.

[F\]: Black is strong in this area, that's why it is difficult for White to do something there. Just stay away. The white stone is already captured, so Black doesn't need to come back.
Black should play at A, getting a very good result.]
(;B[ok]C[[F\]: Atari from the wrong side.];W[nl];B[rk]LB[nm:A]
C[[F\]: Black should play at A. A is a very important move. Also White should play there now.]
(;W[nk];B[oj]
(;W[pi]LB[nj:A]C[[F\]: White should sacrifice the two stone on the right and play at A instead. I would also prefer A for Black.]
;B[oi];W[oh];B[ni];W[nm]LB[nh:A][mi:B]C[[F\]: White can play at A or B first. Black has to answer or looses the group.]
;B[nn]LB[li:A]C[[F\]: Black should jump out at A. This is much better.]
;W[mn];B[no];W[mo]LB[li:A]C[[F\]: Black should still jump out at A.]
;B[qg];W[ph];B[mg];W[nh];B[mi];W[nf]LB[mh:A];B[ng];W[og]LB[mh:A]
TR[rd][rk]C[[F\]: The right white territory is open on two sides, so there is no need to jump in. Black should play at A.]
;B[sg]LB[mh:A]TR[qj][qk]C[This is a pretty ugly outcome. White (me) has almost no territory. Black doesn't have much either, but  is still much stronger than white. It doesn't look like lower black or upper black can be attacked any way. White is just running away really.

[F\]: You are right. It all started because White wanted to safe the marked stones.
White should play A.]
(;W[ke];B[le];W[ld];B[kd];W[lf];B[me];W[mf];B[md]LB[mc:A]C[[F\]: White can should force Black to make a bade shape with A first.]
(;W[mh]LB[kh:A]C[[F\]: White can attack the hole black group by playing at A.]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[kg];W[kh];B[kf];W[lj]C[This saved me. I couldn't find another way to get out and live. Was there a better way?

[F\]: Black can be happy. White had better options. (See move 70.)]
;B[mj];W[mk];B[li];W[ki];B[je];W[cj]C[What was the taiyo here? Was C10 a good move?

[F\]: The left side is the last big open area to play. So C10 is perfect.]
;B[cq]LB[fc:B][fq:A]C[[F\]: Black should play A or B instead.]
;W[cp];B[dq]
(;W[eq]C[Wasn't sure which joseki to do. Would e4 be better next to have a strong position on the left?

[F\]: This move is perfect. E4 is to easy on Black.];B[er];W[fq]
;B[fr];W[gq];B[gr];W[hq];B[kp]
(;W[kk]LB[io:A]C[Was worried about the cuts. Since this was an important capture, I decided to protect.

[F\]: To use your words: This is realy a timidly attitude. You are so strong in this area. And the cut doesn't work, because you can always captuer the black stones with only two moves.
Better to protect your territory with A. See the variation. I included a possible cut scenario. You will see, that there is nothing to worry about.]
;B[lm]LB[kn:A]C[[F\]: White does not need to defend at N7. White should play A.]
;W[mm];B[kn]LB[jo:A]C[[F\]: White cannot kill the corner. So White should try to defend the territory on the left starting with A.]
(;W[bq];B[br];W[cr];B[dr]LB[im:C][jo:A][ko:B]C[I couldn't figure out how to take advantage of black no following the joseki. Would B4 simply have been better?

[F\]: Yes, simply playing B4 is a good move locally in the corner. Allthough the exchange White A, Black B, White C is much better.]
;W[bp];B[ar];W[jo]C[[F\]: Good!];B[ko];W[jn]LB[im:A]C[[F\]: Better at A.]
;B[jm];W[im];B[in];W[hn]LB[il:A]TR[in]C[[F\]: Here starts another mistake. Before your run away with stones, you need to think about, if it they are important. The two white stones are not important, at least the are less important than the territory in the center and on the left side. The same rule applies for the marked black stone. It is not important. Black should try to enter the white framework in the center, playing at A.]
(;B[io]LB[jl:A]TR[jn][jo]C[[F\]: White makes the same mistake as Black. White should sacrifice the marked white stones and play at A.]
(;W[jp];B[ip];W[jq];B[iq]C[This was a mistake on my part. But I wasn't sure what to do with this huge territory on the left, so I tried to make a wall but ended up losing a lot of stones in the process]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[kq];B[hr];W[ho];B[is];W[hp];B[ir];W[kl];B[km]
;W[jl]C[[F\]: Now you see, White lost 5 stones instead of 2 stones. the result is still much better for White.]
;B[ll]LB[df:A]C[[F\]: Black's move is not threatening anything. White can tenuki. Playing A seems the best move to me.]
;W[nj]LB[fc:B][df:A]C[White was still safe. I should have played somewhere else. Where would have been good? F17?

[F\]: You are right, White is safe. F17 is the right area, but I think A is best.]
;B[lq];W[hl]C[[F\]: Another wasted move. White is so strong, protecting the cut is not necessary.]
;B[fc]
(;W[df]LB[fd:A][fe:B]C[Would F15 have been better here?

[F\]: A or B are good alternatives.];B[ff];W[eh];B[em]LB[gh:A]
C[[F\]: Ignoring this move is brave, but it shows the right attitude. White is so strong there, that Black cannot live inside.
I would play A, because it makes it more difficult for Black to live inside and secures a lot of territory immediatly.]
;W[ec];B[gh]C[[F\]: Very big move. Very good!];W[fk];B[gm]C[[F\]: Black cannot live there.]

;W[ej];B[ci];W[fn]LB[di:A]C[[F\]: Black cannot make an eye there. So no need for White to play F6. Playing at A kills the hole group and protects the left side.]
