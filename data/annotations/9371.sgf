C[slaiyfer [5k?\]: hi gg

Cooper: Hi. You played well.. had the lead for most of the game.  Hope my comments help... best.

General comment: you are a little hasty on the invasions... focus on making your own points and invade when you have to. 

Most important moment: C4(move 34). connecting your stones and disconnecting blacks stones  at that point would be great]
