C[Okay, I'm Fwumptapuz (27 Kyu) and I'm playing black against Joojoonas's white (25 Kyu). I made a lot of REALLY horrible mistakes in this game, as you'll see, and I woudl really like some advice and what I should have done to defend against it. I woudl also like general comments on my strategy and how I can sharpen it. Thank you for your time and consideration.


newsman (12k): Hi Fwumptapuz. I've had a chance to review the game. I wish I could say the tendency to make mistakes goes away at some point, but being human, you know.    :)

Anyway, there are five or six main concepts I hope to convey that should help your game.

enjoy.

[harry\]: Hi! I am reviewer of a reviewer. I am 4k at IGS. 
Basically, I agree with majority of your comments. I add my comments where:
- I disagree with you
- you seemed to omit something importamt
- I can somehow improve your high-level thinking about the game

Have fun!];B[op]LB[qo:1][qp:A][qq:2]MA[cc][dc][ec][cd][dd][ed]
[ce][de]C[This is my standard opening move. I always tend to play to the inside side of a hoshi in the corner. It seems most defensive to me. Is this a good tactic?


newsman: An opening move at any of the Xs are time-tested and considered strong. The only difference is strategy. Starting at the 4-5 point like you did, generally emphasizes the bottom side, since it allows white to easily invade at 1 or 2.

If white plays 1, you play 2, claiming part of the corner and side. If white instead jumps to the corner with 2, you play 1, building outside influence you can later use to build territory.

Once moves are made in other corners, if you get a chance to play a second stone at A before white invades, you will have a strong claim on the corner and side.

[harry\]: Fwumptapuz is a beginner, so I would suggest to concentrate on territory than on influence at the moment. Influence-based strategies and moyo strategies need very skillfull analysis and counting. That's why I would suggest to play R4 instead. 

One of pros says (I do not remember which one): "Never lose a chance to invade in 3-4 after 5-4". I would invade in A as white]
;W[dd]LB[cc:B][fc:A]C[My opponent tends to like to play directly on the hoshi. What makes this tactic strong?


newsman: playing on the hoshi is very strong because of its flexibility. It can be used to claim the corner, the side or for outside influence, depending on circumstances and strategy.

two basic points are A and B. See variations

[harry\]: right]
(;B[oj]LB[cc:C][fc:B][oj:A]C[Here I go trying to claim the right side without letting him seperate my groups.


newsman: In the beginning of the game, stones are usually played first in the corners, then the side, and finally the centre. That is because  corner territory is easiest to claim, and the centre is the hardest. At this point two corners are still wide open, so stones in either of those should be considered first.

Remember, your two stones still don't claim the side, since there is a lot of room between them and the side for white to invade and live, though they are beginning to establish influence.

[harry\]: right];W[dp]
(;B[dj]LB[pd:B][dj:A]C[I was attempting to seperate his pieces and destroy the opportunity for connectivity.


newsman: keeping white separated is a great strategy, just make sure you don't end up becoming weak in the process.

see variation];W[pd];B[jd]C[Once again trying to divide and conquer.

[harry\]: It is hard to call this "dividing". There's lots of room to live in every corner for W. I would never thought of W's corner's stones as the ones W wants to connect...]
;W[gq];B[fo]LB[jd:A][dj:B]MA[fc][nc][cf][cn]C[Here I was approching to maybe try and bait him so I could figure out his motive in this corner, but I believe this move to be a bad decision after looing at it now. What do you think?


newsman: I agree it's not a great move. It doesn't really threaten the white stones, and doesn't build on the strength of your own. It really just sits in the middle of nowhere.

At this point in the game, the best moves are those which build up the strength and influence of your own stones while taking away strength from your opponent.

For example, the A and B stones are looking a little lonely and vulnerable, so approach moves at any of the Xs would help make those stones stronger, start to build territory for black and take away potential territory from white.

[harry\]: right];W[mq]C[newsman: white is following the principle I just mentioned, building from his stones towards yours.]

(;B[jq]LB[jq:A][nq:B]MA[fc][nc][cf][qf][cn]C[Another seperation, but this one doesn't seem so good either, in retrospect.


newsman: The placement of this invasion is fine, it's just a little premature. There are other areas on the board with more points up for grabs. Again, any of the previous Xs would still be strong moves. Or attacking the white stone from the other direction works as well. see variation

[harry\]: I do not agree with you. This is the first split that can actually work. B threatens with F3 - another split. 

Try to look for opportunities to attack first (in sente). When there;s nothing to attack - strengthen your position or make territiorial moves. I do not say N3 is better then "crosses", but it is also reaonable. The "crosses" are also attacking moves, eg. after R14 B threatens O17.]
;W[jr]C[Here is first contact made by white in what seems to be an attempt to divide my sides and directly assault my stone at K-13.

newsman: your invasion is forcing white to respond by getting stronger. When attacking, try to remember that it usually makes your opponent strong as well.]
;B[ir]C[Putting pressure on white and trying to force it down away from the rest of his group.]
;W[kr];B[kq]C[This up coming sequence of moves I believe to be one of my first big mistakes.


newsman: as mentioned before, my biggest concern is with the timing, but the sequence itself could have worked out better, as you will see.]
;W[lr];B[lp]MA[iq]C[newsman: connecting at X instead would ensure he is divided.]
;W[iq];B[ip]C[I believe I should have played H-2 to defend instead of trying to attack...


newsman: no, the stone at J2 is dead now. The move at J4 actually works well to use the dead stone to your advantage by using it to build up strength on the outside.]
;W[hq]C[This gave him the opportunity to connect and seal off my group.]
;B[nq];W[hr];B[mp]TR[oj]C[Realizing the stone at J-2 is lost, I'm attempting to form a barrier in order to hopefully force the entire white group into the floor.


newsman:  This is a smart move. White has gained a little bit of territory against the side, but in exchange you have a nice wall that works well with the stone at P10, and with the corner, to form a potentially huge territory.

Unlike chess, where the idea is to eliminate an opponent, go is a game of balance. You won't eliminate all of your opponent's territory, nor should you try. But an exchange like this, letting your opponent live small while building up larger territories, is a fabulous strategy.

[harry\]: right];W[jo];B[mr]LB[lm:B][ho:D][io:C][qp:A]TR[fo]
[ip]SQ[jo]MA[fc][nc][cf][qf][cn]C[Not really sure why I did that...


newsman: It happens. For the last 15 moves there has been a large battle going on along the bottom side. That is now over, but sometimes it is hard to detach yourself from that battle and look again at the whole board.

Sometimes after a protracted struggle like this it's best to take your hand off the mouse, grab another cup of tea or coffee, (or beer) and take a look at the whole board for the next best move.

We both agree N2 isn't a great move. What is better? Those Xs are still there, calling out for attention. A move to point A consolidates the corner, while a black stone around B threatens the lonely white stone at K5 and begins to firm up a large territory around P7. Extending to C or D also puts pressure on the lonely white stone and starts to connect the two triangled black stones, building on your strength while weakening your opponent. Moves that serve two purposes are generally stronger. Also, if you cut off the stone on K5, where will it run?

[harry\]: If you cut K5 it will run to the center :)
Remember - find a weak point and attack it. I think the weakest point of White is Q16. Attacking it from R14 you map out a huge moyo. Also one may think of R17 invasion. W's outside wall will be worthless - and vulnerable. Attacking it later, B will secure territory on right and uppper side]
;W[lq];B[js]C[Once again another dumb move. I knew that he would take J-2 in response, but I was hoping he woudl forget to fill it up before I could take the rest of his group.]
;W[is];B[ms]C[Another blind move on my part...


newsman: yes, as noted previous, time to move on to another part of the board.]
;W[nr]C[...allowing him to get me once again.

newsman: actually, no. see variation]

(;B[kn]LB[fn:A][kn:A]MA[go][ho][io][jo][jp]C[newsman: attacking the marked white stones is a good idea - attacking weak stones frequently works to your advantage, but try coming from the other side with A, to cut it off from the other white stones.

;B[hm]C[Obviously I'm attempting to eradicate the white group around J-5.]

(;W[ik]LB[ik:A][gm:1][hm:A][oq:B]TR[mr][ms][ns]MA[fc][nc][cf]
[qf][cn]C[newsman:  a move by white at 1 instead ensures your black stones are dead and the white group connects to the side.

Rather than play A, which only works because of white's mistake, it's time once again to concede some territory to white and take a look around the board for a larger move.

You can flee to Point 1 yourself and keep the white groups separated, and your black stones alive, or any of those Xs still vacant.

A stone at B forces white to take your triangled stones, but shuts off the corner from invasion. Now that wall is really producing dividends! (and it prevents the invasion that devastated you later)]
;B[hl];W[il];B[ko]TR[hl][hm][gn]SQ[fo][fp][gp][hp][ip]MA[in]
C[He took a long pause right here obviously knowing that his group is as good as gone.


newsman: of course, he could have survived by connecting at X, which was a big mistake. If he connected, your triangled stones would have become very weak and he quickly could have turned the tables on you by attacking them. This, combines with the nearly dead square stones, give white a great advantage, until his big mistake.]
;W[hn]C[I'm not really sure why he made this move, because his plays seemed pretty strong up to this point. Seems kind of like a waste of a turn.]
;B[in]TR[ik][il][jl][im]SQ[fo][fp][gp][hp][ip]C[Mmmm...my first meal of the game.


newsman:  and a huge turning point. Your square stones have risen from the dead and his triangled stones are in BIG trouble.]
;W[oq];B[jj]C[Another really stupid move by me. I didn't even realize O-4 was in danger. I think I got too arrgant and believed that white group at P-2 to be dead to rights and instead decided to close in on the J-8 group..


newsman: yes, though at this point all is still not lost, as you'll see]
;W[np]TR[op][pr]MA[no][pq]C[Ouch.


newsman: at this point, that nice wall and corner territory is on the brink of crumbling. Both of your triangled stones are very weak.

White has two good entry points into your territory, both marked X. You can't protect both, and will lose some territory. The goal is now to limit the damage.

The variations are too numerous to go through, but here are a couple other ideas.]

C[newsman:  even now, a a black stone at Q3 would have sealed up the corner and prevented most of the damage.
At his point, white has already broken into your territory. You can't chase him out because his stones are connected to the side and are alive. You must give him part of your territory. If you try to kill him outright it will backfire, as happened later.]

;W[mm]C[newsman: white sees this and starts to give his group more liberties. He now has five, compared to four for you.

[harry\]: The liberties are noty important now, cause B group can easily escape with R8. W is dead.]

Yeah, that's pretty much it. His reaction perfectly sums up the moment. It's like, what the hell, you know?



newsman: Yeah, it hurts to overlook something like that. It happens, though. Remember however, that you can stop these kinds of disasters with one or two preventative moves earlier on to secure the corner.

Learning what is secure is an ongoing process. Though I spot weaknesses in your position, stronger players find the weaknesses in mine. There's  a lesson in each game, if you learn it.

Here is our altered end-game. It didn't really matter, but I wanted to know simply so I can understand the rules better and see if I was missing something. Anyway, thank you for reviewing my game.

~Fwumptapuz


newsman: the white stones at J16 and G9 are also dead, but, like you said, at this point it doesn't matter.

Hopefully my comments throughout the game were helpful. To sum up, here's some ideas.

- always remember to look at the whole board. Go is a complex game and this isn't always easy, but when a life and death struggle has finished in one part of the board, take a break and look around. Usually the next biggest move is somewhere else.

- try to work on your opening sequences, especially joseki. There are many resources that can answer your questions about playing on hoshi points or 4-5 points, etc.
I've found the Elementary Go Series by James Davies to be a fantastic series of books. The ideas there are useful for players up to single kyu.
The best free resource I've found is Sensei's Library on the internet.
You can find it at http://senseis.xmp.net
You can spend many hours there (if not days).

- in the beginning, generally try to extend from your own stones to expand your power and take away your opponent's power. We saw examples of this in the game.

- you understand the concepts of connecting and dividing, though a couple times you missed a chance to either connect or divide. Keeping your stones connected, and dividing your opponent's, is a central concept in the game. Don't overlook this powerful weapon.

- efficency. I'm still working on this concept myself, but in general try not to waste stones. A useless stone is like giving your opponent a free move, while a stone that serves two or three purposes saves you a move or two down the line.

- try to learn some techniques for invading your opponent's territory, either along the side or in the corner. If your opponent's territory is large, but still very wide open, it calls out for an invasion. There are some basic sequences you can learn, that you can find in the above resources.

Anyway, I hope this review helps. It's been fun for me to do.

If you have any questions about my review, don't hesitate to contact me,

Thanks,
