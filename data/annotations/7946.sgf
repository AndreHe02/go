AB[pd][dp]C[hi,

i hope you could give me some advices on my style of play and
my play decisions and the mistakes i've made.

;W[or];B[nr];W[qq];B[pp];W[rp];B[ro];W[rs];B[dj]TR[qo]C[Sirkut> Very good joseki, however it is necessary to protect R5 by playing either R5 or, probably better, R6.]
;W[cq]C[Sirkut> Never ignore a corner invation. Since the corners are worth so much, you can't allow white to have a move ahead of you in developing it.]

(;B[hc]C[Sirkut> Oops. Always be wary of this Z shape. If you'd extended one more move, you would have had lots of possibilities. Here, you only have one place to look for more liberties, H16.

[dd][ed][ae][be][fe][ge][he]C[Sirkut> You did well and got a similar shape as to my variation on move 48, however my variation had the extension a line higher giving you a bit more influence. It also gave a few chance to cut up white's dragon he's building.]
;W[cf];B[kc]TR[pj]C[Sirkut> Since your corner is safe, and if there's a battle for R17 you'll probably get half the corner, you want to turn your attention back to the big points - and there's one huge glaring one, R10.]
;W[cn]
(;B[cl]C[Sirkut> Rather than worry about this stone, it would be a better idea to worth _with_ white by encouraging him to take the corner while you build up a big wall facing your corner of influence - T1.

;B[fq];W[do];B[eo];W[en];B[fo]C[Sirkut> There's that Z shape again.]
;W[fm]C[Sirkut> By trying to save D10, you ended up encouraging white to wall it in.]
;B[jp];W[fk];B[pj]C[Sirkut> Great way to take advantage of a wasted move by white.]
;W[fi];B[kf]TR[jf]C[Sirkut> And again! I like the shape of K14 a little better there though.]
;W[qc];B[nc]C[Sirkut> Always attack a corner invasion head-on. By fighting them you'll get a stronger postion automatically - no reason to do it now.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[qd];B[od]C[Sirkut> You ended up two moves behind in the joseki.]

(;B[gm]C[Sirkut> Your two black stones aren't dead yead. This move encourages white to build up strenth around them. If you hoped to find life with them, you should try pushing out  in each direction from them.

Always remember to be looking out for the biggest move on the board for every move that you make. Try not to be attached to individual stones. Instead think of 'thickness and strength' versus 'weak and agile.' Also, start to look across the board at the larger shapes your groups will form as the push across the board.

I hope you find my comments helpful.  Feel free to email me if you have any questions!]

(;B[hd]TR[hc]SQ[ce][ee]C[Sirkut> This is going to be a messy fight, but now black clearly has the upper move. That Z group now has 3 places to look for liberties.
If white pushed out at H17, you can attack E15 and C15 to make him back off.]
