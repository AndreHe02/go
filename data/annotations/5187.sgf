C[Hello, this is 
my first time submitting a game for review. I have gone over the game myself 
and written some comments (and a few questions) about some parts of the 
game. The whole game was unclear to me so comments from the reviewer on any 
part of the game is apreciated.



Sorry to be 2 weeks late, I was out of town and busy for quite a few 
days.];B[qd];W[dc];B[dq]C[Usually I would play Q3, but today I felt that I 
was up for a figthing game.


I think first few stones doesn't matter.];W[po];B[ce];W[do]
;B[dm]C[I don't really know this joseki, but I hoped to get some 
thickness to support my c15 stone.];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[er]
;W[fo];B[gp]C[I 
felt good about this, If white had played F5 before C3 my G4 stone would be 
at F3. Is White C3 first playable (as in the game)?



I have no problem with C3.];W[cm];B[cl];W[dl]
(;B[dk]C[Looking back this is probably wrong? I think I should play atari at 
b7 first to prevent any chance that white will cut.


Usually people do not atari at b7.];W[el];B[bm];W[cn];B[ck]

(;W[ci]C[I didn't get this move so I was trying to play it 
calm.];B[ek]C[C13];W[dg];B[ee];W[gc];B[fd];W[fc];B[fg];W[fh]
;B[gh];W[fi];B[eg];W[dh]C[Now i was really happy with my shape, and the game as a whole. My 
only concern was to manage C9 in a good way. Are my feelings justified?


black is fine, but not as good at you think.];B[fl];W[gi];B[em]
C[Afterwards 
i felt this was overly stable. White running out with the E8 stones would 
only have made me strong on the outside.


This is fine.];W[hh];B[cc]C[I now feel that this move is wrong. I think I 
can play G5 and consider C17 and H14 to be miai.



should connect G13];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[df]

was careless. It seems that white G9 captures my stones.


correct.];W[hi];B[gk];W[bj]

conclusion was that I still liked my chances. Whites setup looks 
improvised.];B[qh];W[rd];B[qe];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[re];W[sc]

p18, o18 etc no longer sente.];W[rb];B[jd];W[oe]
