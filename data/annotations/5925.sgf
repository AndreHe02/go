C[Korrigank : Greetings reviewer. This is a game played on KGS recently. The end result is a B+0.5 win, only due to the fact that there was no komi. As I felt behind most of the game, I would like pointers, from Black's side, on the mistakes I surely made, particularly in fuseki and chuban concerning directions of play, shapes, etc. I probably missed a couple of big points and played small moves instead, etc... I added a couple comments during the game when there's a particular question I have. I probably wasn't very good in yose either, but it was enough to catch up a bit.

Hi. This is Danny Kwon. I'll be reviewing your game. My comments will start with D:]
;B[qd]C[morgon [3k\]: hi

(;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jc]C[Korrigank : I hesitated here. White's extension is nice as it pincers, so I wondered if I shouldn't have pincered it instead of the usual joseki. In any case, I didn't want to be too submissive and just jump out with F15, so I double approach. I retrospect, it created a heavy group for which I had to live small and not in sente so... I dunno.]

(;B[db]C[D: This move looks too low in this stage of the opening.]
;W[cc]
(;B[cf]LB[fc:A][dd:C][cf:B]C[D: This is an overplay. Black has two weak groups while white has one.]
;W[ee]
(;B[hc]C[Korrigank : Same thing here, I feared that jumping out too soon would weaken my C14 stone, so I made a crappy extension... perhaps H16 better?]
;W[ch]C[Korrigank: next parts are kind of painfull for me.]

[ef][gf][dg][fg][gg][hg]C[D: Black should defend these stones with a move around A.]

(;B[dp]C[Korrigank : the top more or less settled, I wondered here wether I should just shimari my bottom corner, or move on his corner, or on his side. Once again, I feared attacking near C9 would force him out and weaken my B group. I really don't know here.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[bo]
(;B[eq];W[po]C[D: Black does not get to extend from E3 stones and Q3 is on the third line which allows white to press down the bottom side.]

(;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[qj]C[Korrigank : Should have I attached on the outside joseki? to use E3 stones better?]

[ss]C[Korrigank [4k\]: thanks

D: I think black was ahead after the opening. Moves on the second line can be very big in the endgame. Black should always look for sente moves in the endgame. Reverse sente moves are sente moves that also prevent your opponent from taking sente. You should look for these as well. I enjoyed commenting your game and the questions were really good. Take care.
