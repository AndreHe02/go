(;B[qf]C[This feels very over-concentrated for black, but it's nearly inevitable in a handicap game. However, black should be more aggresive.]
;W[fq];B[lq];W[lp]C[Contacting a stone makes it stronger. The sequence played here allowed simple life for black, and does not help white.]
;B[kp];W[lo];B[iq]C[White cannot play away here; white has no base, no eyes, and has connection issues.]
(;W[cq]C[An important point in the opening game is to play in the big areas. Especailly as white in a large handicap game, white needs to play light and flexible. A play on the top side would be bettet.]

;W[ad]C[The sequence up to here weakens the D13 stone. If white wanted to invade the corner, he should play in the corner without D13, or play at F17 to prepare.]
;B[dm];W[jc];B[kd];W[jd]C[Black generally needs to protect the D15 cut, as I'm sure you are aware now. The K17 stones assist in allowing this cut to work.]

[is][js][ks]C[A few comments about the general game. First, 6 stone games are difficult to review; wihte has to either overplay and capitalize on black's mistakes, or play steady, and wait for black to make his own mistakes.

Both players played very solidly, which worked well for black. As white, you needed to kseep your groups either light, or alive, before playing away. both players need to play a little more aggresively and use thickness.]
