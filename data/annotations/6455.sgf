RE[B+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[SH: Hello! I'm very happy that you like to review my game. I (oficially 4k at the time) was playing white against an 1k.

Please point out my mistakes. I'm especially interested in fuseki and direction of play.

CG: As I understand, you were playing black?!];B[qe];W[cd];B[oq]
C[SH: this is an opening i use to play
[see my sensei's page for info why :)  \]];W[pc];B[nd];W[pe]
;B[pd];W[od];B[qd];W[oe]C[SH: too bad :(
w P17 is more fun :(

CG: Well, I can understand white's reasoning. This is a save way to play, and the variations of the Taisha-Joseki starting with P17 are very complicated. 
To quote Miyamoto Sensei: Know the Taisha but don't play it!]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[ob];W[md];B[qg]C[SH: is this move correct? or is q13 better?

CG: This move is correct.]
(;W[nb]C[SH: mistake... w should o15 in sente

CG: Yes. Now the result is favourable for black because of the remaining ladder aji.]
;B[pb];W[do]C[SH: white still has some ladder aji

CG: Yes, the aji is bad.];B[qp]TR[qg]C[SH: is this big enough?
or better approach the top left corner?

CG: Since your stone at R13 is on the third row, the right side is not so important. An approach move at E16 might be bigger. But I don't think the difference is very big.]
;W[dq]C[CG: I think that for white it's also more important to enclose the upper left.]
;B[jp]C[SH: 4th line for better interaction with b q10

CG: I don't see a black stone at Q10, and I don't think Q10 is an important move for black right now since it would be too near to R13.
The upper left is still more important.];W[fc]
(;B[cj]C[SH: is c11 better?

CG: That's a hard question. C11 might be slightly better, but in the game C10 is perfect ...]

(;W[ch]C[CG: ... since this is the wrong direction.];B[cm]C[CG: This move combines an extension with an attack on the corner. This is very good for black, so white C12 was wrong.]

(;W[cn]LB[cp:A]C[SH: is this a good move?
black gets heavy, but overall he also gets stronger
and white needs to be careful with A

CG: I agree that this is a dubious move. White is trying to get sente, but this leaves bad aji again (which you spotted correctly).]
;B[dm];W[ne];B[bd]C[CG: I think this is a bad idea. You are ahead in territory, so you should be careful that you don't help white creating a big moyo at the top. By invading immeadiately, you help him to build thinkness.
Just playing Q9 would be better.];W[ce];B[pk];W[qo]C[CG: Overplay.]

(;B[rp]C[SH: is this move correct?

CG: Most important is to avoid giving white sabaki. I think your move is good, but Q4 might be even better since it makes it harder for white to run away.]
;W[oo];B[mp];W[pm]C[CG: Too heavy.]
(;B[ql]C[SH: this seems like the wrong direction
b should try to contain instead
like, b o8

CG: The question is how you can use your thickness after white lives (see variation). Denying white a base and chasing him while taking territory is good enough.]
;W[nm];B[nk];W[lm];B[lk];W[jm]C[CG: Running on neutral points like this is painful.]

(;B[hm]C[SH: i was not going to kill him
i just wanted to see in what direction he turns

CG: What would you do if white attaches at L9? I think H7 is dubious. What is wrong with K9?]

(;W[in]C[CG: Wrong direction. I think L9 is the move here.]
;B[ie]C[SH: reduce first....];W[jd]C[SH: can black another move here in sente?

CG: Well, was J15 really sente?
I you want to continue, you can play J16.];B[cc]C[SH: ....then take the corner]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[be];B[ab]C[CG: ?? I think A17 is the only move here.]

(;W[db];B[ba];W[ei];B[ek]C[SH: this move seems ok, but can't black play a better move here?
maybe just f7?

CG: I don't see why f7 should be better.];W[ho];B[hq]C[CG: This move is not important, and I don't think it's sente (F5 and L9 are miai). I would rather move at the top (J12).]
;W[fo];B[fi]C[CG: I think this is a mistake. You are just harming J15.]
;W[fh];B[gi];W[gh]
(;B[ej]C[SH: this is a mistake, right?

CG: Yes.];W[ih];B[je]C[SH: too heavy?
i did not see any way to come out lightly

CG: Because it's nearly too late to come out at all ...]
(;W[id]C[SH: is this white move correct? i think white should instead try to contain me

CG: If he tries, he must kill you. Maybe he was not confident enough he could.]
;B[kg];W[ki]C[CG: This is strange. If white wants to kill, J16 was a mistake. Now it seems to be too late.]

(;B[jk]C[SH: mistake... black needs to run out, right?

CG: Definitely!];W[mi];B[ji]C[SH: i hoped to come out somehow

CG: You hoped fo a wonder like in the upper left?];W[jh];B[kh]
;W[lh];B[kd];W[kc];B[mg]C[SH: misread. very stupid];W[lg];B[lf]
;W[mf];B[hh]C[SH: i tried to force white to kill my stones so i could at least reduce the top left

CG: I don't see how ;-)];W[hg];B[hi]
(;W[jg]C[CG: This is bad.];B[kf];W[ng];B[gg];W[hf];B[eh]
(;W[eg]C[CG: ???];B[fg]C[SH: i was very happy with this

CG: You were very lucky ...]
(;W[gf]C[CG White should resign after such a blunder.];B[ef]
;W[dg];B[dr]C[too small?];W[cr];B[eq];W[dp];B[er]
(;W[bn]C[SH: is this white move big?
i'd probably play F14 as white

CG: Allowing black B2 does not make white happy. The game is over anyway.]
;B[ff];W[gd];B[ii]C[SH: sente, w should f15 now]
(;W[ph]C[SH: he did not read carefully :(

CG: Why should he start reading NOW?];B[ig];W[if];B[jf];W[ig]
;B[ge]C[SH: The game ended here, black won by resignation.

i think i was leading even with white responding correctly. is this correct?

CG: Yes, black was ahead anyway. It is usually a bad idea to continue a serious game after a mistake like white 90.]
