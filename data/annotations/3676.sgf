C[Kikenjin [19k?\]:(kikenjin@reality23.com) Hi,
My main concern on this game is how could I improve my general play. I sometimes play moves that degenerate in a huge loss of territory. It seems that I don't see the larger consequences of my moves.

I've tried to analyse bad moves that I saw, but I'm sure there's plenty more!!!!

Any other tips would be welcome.
I'm sending a copy to my opponent, so I would be grateful if you make a review for Black and white.

Thanks!

PS : I play Black on this game.
White is b4l0u [17k\]: b4l0u@yahoo.ca

Hello,

my name is Rainer (Beholder) and I did the review of this game.

I tried to give some specific advice during the game (marked with a "*"). Here I would like to give some general advice to both players.

For Black:
-don't touch stones you are attacking
-try to play more solid and take stones further away into account
-don't let yourself be pushed into defence so easily
-try to play towards your strong groups and do not expand from them
-try to cut your opponents stones if the possiblity arises

For White:
-try to play a bit more solid extensions
-don't be too jealous about the opponents territory, try to build your own before invading

I hope this review will help you to get stronger and have more fun playing this wonderful game.

Best regards

;W[qq]C[*This is an overplay by White. The game just begun and there are much bigger points to take.]
;B[dd];W[dp];B[cj]LB[qm:B][pn:A]C[*I think it would have been better to strengthen the black stone in the lower right.]
;W[qe];B[nd]LB[od:A][qg:C][ph:B]C[Kikenjin [19k?\]: I did not know how to respond to  R15, so I tried O16

*This is a joseki situation. The most common plays would be A or a squeeze play at B or C.]
;W[pd];B[pg]LB[qc:A]C[*It would be better for Black to get into the corner with a play like A. This way White gets the corner.]

;W[qn]TR[oq][qq]C[Kikenjin [19k?\]: I had a hard time with this one!!

*By playing A, Black didn't take the two white stones into account. White is strong in this corner, so Black would have to play more solid.]
;B[ql]LB[pn:A][rn:B]C[Kikenjin [19k?\]: Would "A" or "B" be better in this situation?

*Black sacrifices the marked stone.
With A Black would get more influence towards the center in exchange for territory at the right side. A move at B would only strenghten White.]
;W[on];B[jd]C[*A move on the third line would be better shape.]
;W[qg];B[qh];W[rg];B[rh];W[nf];B[ng]LB[oe:A]C[*A would be better for Black. White would be enclosed in the corner.]

;B[mc];W[me];B[ld];W[lf];B[gp]LB[fq:A]C[Kikenjin : This was to isolate white in the corner

*A would be better. It attacks the corner.];W[fq];B[gq];W[gr]
;B[hr];W[er];B[mq]TR[gp][gq][hr]C[Kikenjin : And this one, to make a base for the marked stones.

*This move by Black is a bit over ambitious. The stone is too far away from the wall.]
