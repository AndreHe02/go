C[SaurusDNA [4k\]: Hi!

Hi, I'm Saurus.

Please review for the black side.

This game was a nice game, with no mistakes or big losses for either side. In the end, I lost by 1.5 points, and I can't find ANYTHING in this game where I think I could have done better. I am completely stumped as to where I could improve.

I have written down my thoughts for many moves to give you an insight into my way of thinking.

I also asked some questions.

I am hoping that perhaps you will see and point out some key concepts that I might be misunderstanding or missing from my play.

Many thanks

(;B[qo]LB[cd:A]C[Q17 felt really small here, so I decided to make my lower shimari instead, knowing that o17 is too far from r16 to cause serious pressure.

H: I feel that Q17 was the proper move; see the variations.  This isn't too bad, but White has a great follow-up at A now.]
(;W[jq]C[Already, I can see that white does not want me to build a moyo, and wants to fight. Therefore, I play 4-4 at d16 for flexibility.]
;B[dd]C[H: I feel this was a good exchange for black.];W[cf]
(;B[fd]C[I also considered f17, but I intend to pincer o17 as soon as possible with a low pincer, which would then be misplaced if f16 was at f17.

H: I would prefer f17 here.];W[bd];B[cc]C[I play here, because I intend to play k17, and then I have made some nice potential territory, without having to worry about the 3-3 invasion at c17.]
;W[ci];B[jc]C[My plan all along...];W[qc]C[H: q17 looks too dangerous here...  q16 is the only choice.]
;B[pd];W[pc];B[od];W[nd]C[H: The proper move here is p17]
(;B[rc]C[Looking back, this move doesn't look so good, but I was worried about my shape if white played at s16.]

;W[id];B[ie]C[Big decision here - I still don't know if hane or nobi was better.

On the one hand, if I start a nobi-train, the top left starts feeling intense pressure.

On the other hand, if I hane, I minimize the pressure on the top left, but I don't know if my k17 stones are strong enough to handle the cut at k15.

;B[oi]C[Up till now, I feel OK with the result of this battle. In exchange for 10-odd points on top, I have made 10-odd points of territor on the right, and white's O13 group is still not happy.

H: White's o13 group is fine, and you lost your territory on the top entirely.  I think this is a loss for Black.]
;W[fb];B[mi]C[This was a bad move.

My idea was to force white to kill the n18 group, thereby making outside influence...

H: Yes, this move wasn't forcing at all...]
(;W[na];B[lq]C[But then I changed my mind, because playing down the n-line doesn't really give me any influence.

But OK, white had to o19, and also, it is hard for O13 to get out, so I guess it turned out OK.

I tenuki, and take what I believe to be the biggest point on the board.]

Where else was better?

H: Playing safe near the end of the game was fine, and black remained ahead.

Most of the mistakes were in direction early on, which led to a situation from which you had to claw back.  I would recommend studying pro games fuseki, and looking into the books by Yuan Zhou, which will help to explain the mindset of a strong player.]
