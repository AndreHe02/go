================================

Hi reviewer, i haven't specific question.
 I don't know if i must resign after move 156.
I hope to learn a lot!
Thx

** My review comments will start with two asterisks like this.  After reviewing the game, I think I have two high level observations:
1. You seem to leave too many potential cutting points / low liberty weaknesses.  The lower left group really suffered from this, but there are also a number of places throughout the game where you do a one point jump that seems rather questionable to me.
2. You may be focusing too much on taking away what the opponent has instead and not fully considering how to build your own territory.  The early approach on the left, the follow up lower left corner invasion and the later invasion on the right all seem like examples of this.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ec];W[dj];B[ci]C[** I don't like this move for a few reasons.  In a lot of ways, this is a lot like a contact play that puts you at a disadvantage in the local fight.  Additionally, you're playing too close to your two stones in the corner.]
;W[di];B[cg]C[** The jump away from the contact seems strange to me.  Looking over the game I saw a number of places where you seem to leave a weakness behind that you probably shouldn't have.]
;W[cj];B[bi]C[** 2nd line stone this early is likely too small]
;W[bj];B[dm]C[** I think you're doing this to try and reduce the strength of the white stones?  They're an unfortunate side effect of the side approach.  I think white is too strong locally and you're mostly pincering yourself.  This kind of worked out for you, but your group did end up fairly weak (due to a potential cut) late into the game.]
;W[fm];B[eo];W[ep];B[fo];W[en];B[do];W[dn];B[co];W[cp];B[fq]
C[** Another one space jump that seems unusual to me.  I probably would have played F4 directly and contented myself with outside thickness if white tried to build their corner.  The potential cut at G5 remained for a long time and remained a concern very far into the game.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[eq];B[bp];W[bq];B[ap]C[** Black now has three potential cutting points.  Why not B5 instead of A4?]
;W[gq];B[hp];W[aq];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[hq]C[** I was looking at F2 instead of H3.  You can come very close to killing the corner if white doesn't block the follow up at E2.  It's definitely something to consider...]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[fr];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[pn];B[qq];W[pq];B[rp]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[qr];W[qk];B[sr];W[nr];B[lq]C[** Another one point jump that seems strange to me.  I think playing N2 directly probably works better]
;W[lr];B[or];W[pr];B[mr];W[os];B[kr];W[qf];B[nc];W[ph];B[rd]
;W[re];B[qm]C[** This seems too deep to me for this stage.  I see the potential against white's corner group, but I don't see how to leverage it.  A prep move such as O7 might be good setup for this while also building your bottom territory.  Your top area also hasn't been sealed in yet.]
;W[qn];B[pl];W[nm];B[gm];W[gl];B[fn];W[em];B[pk];W[ql];B[qj]
;W[pm]C[** With this, white has become stable in the corner.  I find it hard to justify the invasion now.  White O7 is reducing your bottom territory and the fight could infringe on what you get at the top.]
;B[oj]C[** It may have been better to leave a cut point and ensure your group has a good escape]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[ni];B[nk]C[** I like O10 or possible a larger jump here, but I think you're already in trouble]
;W[mj];B[mk]C[Question: how i  must scape from this situation?

** Usually, the answer is "earlier".];W[lk];B[mm]C[** I'm not so sure about this one space jump...]
;W[ml];B[nl]C[** You're forcing white to strengthen on the outside]
;W[ll];B[oi];W[oh]C[** Without the O8/M8 exchange, I think you had something to work with where you could at least break out to continue running.  It's already a bad situation though]
