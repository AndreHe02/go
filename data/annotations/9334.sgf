C[Hello and thanks for your review.

I'm requesting this review for black. I had trouble finding moves and sequences that maintained sente for me, and whites advantage just kept growing because of it.

Hey Andrew, how's the West coast treating you? Its Greg, from Waterloo. This is a good game to review. A lot of the issues arose from bad direction and not just lack of reading. I hope this helps.]
;B[dp];W[cd];B[pd]C[So as far as I know, according to classical theory, when there is a diagonal opening, it's harder for both players to make a large moyo because their corners won't work too well together so it's usually a little better to play a more territory oriented corner move like a 3-4. However, this probably won't make a difference at our level. I just think it's interesting to think about.]
;W[pq];B[po];W[qm]TR[oq]C[The triangled move isn't really a joseki. The result here will be better for white. His territory is large, and your thickness doesn't compensate.

At this point, it's better to think about building something with the top right stone rather than the bottom left one. See variations.]

(;B[oq];W[pp];B[op];W[qo];B[oo];W[pn]TR[ip]C[I think here instead of trying to fill in the moyo on the moyo, I would push at the border. P6 looks very good to me. As white, instead of Q6, I might have played R6. Black can't force nearly as many moves.]

(;B[ip];W[cn]TR[dn]SQ[en][eo]C[Generally, the attachment at triangle is not considered good. The main case to use it is when white has an approach move on both side. You make yourself and one of the white groups strong, while the other remains weak. However, when white has only one approach move like in this case, this makes white unecessarily strong. If you really want to play for moyo, E5 or E6 would be better.]

(;B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[cp];B[cq];W[co];B[dq];W[dj];B[ed];W[hd]
TR[df]SQ[ce]C[Generally, the small knight's move is considered a little sketchy. The result is generally either good for white, or unclear. However, here, it's maybe okay. However, I prefer a different move. See C15 variation.]

(;B[df];W[ee];B[de];W[dd];B[fe];W[ec];B[ef];W[fc]TR[dj]C[This result isn't that bad. White's better, but not much, since his stone at D10 is out of place and you have sente.]
;B[nc];W[gf]TR[fh]SQ[eh][ei]C[Indeed F12 is a little off. The keima is inherently weak and right now, you need to play strongly. I indeed like E12 better, or perhaps even E11. Eventually, if the black stone become stone enough, you can cut at G15, H15, H14]
;B[fh]C[E12 might have been better. I lose sente in a few moves to maintain connection to E14.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[dg];B[ff];W[bf]C[The game is looking pretty good for white now.]
;B[dk]C[I was really not sure what to do here, and I think I went with a choice that expressed some jealousy of whites left hand side. I thought the weaknesses I saw there could be coordinated into wiping out a large chunk of that area.  I didn't manage to make that happen.

Thing is, I'm not sure what would be alright on the right side. R16 seemed slow. and extending along the right from the top also seems slow. Whats reasonable?

Greg: I think there are two possibilities here. Either you remove some of white's points, or you build more thickness on the outside. The big are black needs to focus on now is the bottom. I don't think you have a good way to 100% get rid of some of white's points. The problem is, black's upper right group is still weak which could become a heavy burden later.]
;W[dl]TR[cj]C[I might choose a different move here. See variation.]

C[You should exchance F10 and E9 before playing D12.];B[ch]
;W[bi];B[bh];W[aj]C[Maybe I should just give up sente, and leave C13 unplayed.

Greg: I agree. Now P6 is a must.]
(;B[cg];W[lp]SQ[on]C[P6 still looks like the right move here to me.]

;B[js];W[io];B[hp];W[go];B[gp];W[fp]C[I have a few choices through here, and I probably went with the worst. While thinking about it, the D5 weakness kept me from playing another option.

Greg: I agree. I think G3 is better. This fight is hard for black though. No really good options.]

;W[hk];B[gj];W[hj];B[gi];W[gl];B[fl];W[kk]C[At this point, white has pretty much won. There is no real way to attack any of white's stones. There is miai for the big points on the top and the right sides, and so the amount of territory black and white will end up with is largely settled.
