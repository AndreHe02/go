;B[pd]C[Hello,
this is a game i played on IGS against someone stronger than me. I made a lot of silly moves :(
I made my own review, can you review my review ?

thx by advance,
turvoy];W[dd];B[oq];W[qp];B[dp];W[po];B[qj]C[Good];W[gp]C[White strategy is a bit dubious as it lets Black manage his stone in the SE corner.]
;B[lq]C[I like this move];W[pq];B[op];W[jq];B[lo];W[ql]C[This exchange seems equal for both]
;B[dn];W[dq]C[Too early.];B[cq];W[ep];B[do];W[cr]LB[er:a]C[White is playing too optimisticly. Better at "a"]
;B[dr];W[eq];B[br]C[Black is better];W[qg];B[oj]LB[nd:a]C[This move is not bad but you can also play "a" and let white try something.]
;W[md]LB[nd:a][pf:b][og:c]C[I don't know what to do against such move...
I thought of A,B or C.

C is may be the better]
(;B[pg]C[I am not really proud of this move.
JH : Not so good.];W[pf];B[qf];W[qe];B[pe];W[of];B[rf];W[re]
;B[rg];W[qc]C[The situation is horrible for me now :(

JH : No. It is playable];B[pc]C[A desperated move...
JH : No. The normal move];W[qb];B[pb]
(;W[qd]C[I think this move allow me to make ko,
is there a better move here ?
JH : There is a ko latter in the corner];B[sb]LB[rc:a]C[JH : This not the good move and it is too early. White can answer at "a"]
;W[qa];B[mc]LB[ne:a][mb:b]C[This move is not so good. I think the best is "a" and "b" is playable.]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[nc];B[nb];W[lc];B[nd]C[JH : Loosing one stone is almost loosing the game. What happens if you connect. I think Black can live.]
;W[mb]C[Good !!];B[ne];W[ng];B[mf];W[mh];B[kf];W[ph];B[rl]C[this move is probably ajikeshi.
JH : And it doesn't work];W[rk];B[qk];W[rm];B[rj];W[sl];B[ol]
;W[kh];B[if];W[id]
(;B[ih]C[This move is not bad as playing in the corner doesn't work too much as can be seen in variations.]
;W[ni];B[oi]LB[gf:a]C[Black is dreaming here. Better to play at "a".]
;W[oh];B[mg]LB[le:a]C[This move is really bad. Trying to prevent the cut of the tobi should be done at "a"]
;W[mk];B[nm];W[qi];B[ri];W[kj];B[dg]LB[gf:a]C[Should be played at "a" to protect the group.]

;B[cf];W[df]C[Looks good for White.];B[de];W[ef];B[cd];W[ee]
;B[ce];W[cc];B[dc];W[ed];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[db];B[eh]C[Is this move an overplay ?
JH : Yes. Terrible overplay. Black should atari underneath and live.]
;W[bg]C[Black is punished.];B[ae]C[probably :(
JH : There is no way for Black anyway.];W[dh]
(;B[eg]C[Black should live. (var 2)];W[ei];B[fi];W[ej]C[May be it is time to live in the corner. Now !!]
;B[fj];W[ek];B[dl]C[This is definitely too much.];W[bf];B[be]
;W[ba];B[ca]C[Yet another stupid move,  i should have already resigned.
JH : It doesn't work . So you are loosing ko threats.];W[da]
;B[se];W[sd]
(;B[sc]C[This move does not work,  connecting is probably better.
What is your opinion ?
JH : true : it doesn't work. Connecting leads to a kô. You should have try this.]
;W[sf]C[JH : I suppose Black resigns.
Conclusion : Black seems weaker than White in middle game fighting but must try harder to check if his moves are working or not before playing them.]

You have simply to play the jump in the center at "a". Quite playable for Black too.]
