C[Dear reviewer,

I played black in this game. I think it was a close game. There were a few times in the game where I was doubting between various moves or I was wondering whether a move was necessary or not. I would like to get comments on those moves and please also give comments on other mistakes you see. Thank you very much for reviewing this game.

----

A: I'm Araldo van de Kraats, IGS 2k*. I hope the review will be helpful to you. My comments are indicated with "A:"]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[nq]C[Is this kakari good or would an extension have been better?

----

A: In the diagonal opening it is difficult to make large scale frameworks like the sanrensei. Therefore extensions may not be a good choice. Anyway, approach moves like this are never wrong.

In general, first take the corners, than make approach moves and finally big extensions. I recommend this order unless you really know what you are doing.]
;W[qn];B[pr]
(;W[cn];B[cl];W[fp]C[A: I all cases: try to split whites stones and get out with your corner stone.]

(;B[ip]C[A: I think this stone is the problem. Its purpose is not very clear to me. It does not attack nor defend very strong. Therefore it gives white the opportunity to attack the corner stone.]
;W[cq]
(;B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq]LB[ep:B][fq:A]C[I played this move because if I played A I didn't want white to play B. Was it correct?

A: You can ask yourself the question: If white plays B right now (after black E3) and you play A as a response. Is this exchange good for black or white? I think this exchange is a little better for white, but it is hard to tell. If the exchange is better for white, you should not play A.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[dn]TR[do][dp][dq][eq][er][fp]C[Here I had the feeling it didn't go well. I was afraid the triangled group would be captured and my C8 stone looked quite weak. What did I do wrong?

----

A: What we can see here is that you build a wall, but now the white F4 stone is very annoying, since it is on the 4th line. Also the C8 stone is very lonely.

A better choice would be to build the wall in the other direction as can be seen in a variation a few move ago.]

(;B[fn]C[A: A dangerous move. First of all, you push white into the direction of the weak C8 stone. Secondly, white may decide to escape with the F4 stone later in the game.]

(;W[en]C[A: This white push helps you to secure the F4 capture]
;B[fo];W[fm];B[eo];W[dj]
(;B[bj]LB[cj:A][el:B]C[Is A better or should I run with B?

----

As a rule of thumb, first try to get out. Living small while white gets lots of influence on the outside is often not a good idea.]

TR[qk][ri]C[A: I prefer an extension on the 3rd line here, because it doesn't give with the opportunity to slide under it. R9 would be an excellent move for white now, since there is the S11 follow up move.]
;W[qq]TR[nq][pr]C[A: This continues the joseki that was not finished before. Black should defend his two stones now, or else white can invade.]

(;B[jd]TR[lq][qc]C[A: White has nice invasion points at M3 and R17]

[of:B][ql:D]C[Here I was considering A, B, C, D and just didn't know which one was best or maybe another point would have been better. Could you please tell me which move is best and explain why?

----

A is an excellent move. It threatens the follow up move at F18. However, white can ignore it and play R9 followed by M3.

B is too slow. Since white has 4 corners, black should try to make some territory as soon as possible, or else he will lose the game.

C is a very good move. It converts the whole bottom in almost secure black territory, while protecting the two black stones and preventing an invasion.

D is also very interesting, as it is sente against the corner. See variation for what can happen if white ignores this move.

I would play D first. White will defend and black can play C or M3 directly after that.]

;W[of];B[oe];W[ni];B[ql];W[qr];B[no]TR[ql]C[A:  R8 and O5: a very good sequence.]
;W[kp]C[A: Black has just created a second weak group. A way to take advantage of this is to chase one of them into the direction of the other and than make a splitting attack. 

Another strategy is to make influence by means of a leaning attack on one group, followed by attacking the other group using this influence.

This way it should be possible to capture at least one of the groups.]

(;B[jn]C[Is a capping play better?

A: I think the capping attack is too direct. Better chase L4 out and try a splitting attack. K6 is fine.

Try to prevent white from making a base is also a good choice (K3)]

(;B[jl]LB[mk:A]C[In retrospect this seems a little easy for white.

;B[km]TR[jm]C[A: It is not really important to defend this cut.]

White can cut off a single stone. So what?];W[lk]TR[kk][km]
[ml]C[A: No need to play these moves.]
(;B[gm]C[I tried to make some territory.

----

A: Good. However, destroying territory is as good as making it.  

For example G7 gives you a few extra points, maybe 5, in gote.

 It is easy to see that moves like F18 and B5 are worth much more. B5 is particularly good, since it is a sente move.]
;W[fl]TR[bo][fb][rm]C[A: Large endgame moves are indicated]
;B[fj]C[A: Better play large endgame before trying to make territory in the centre. Territory open at two or more sides often becomes very small against the end of the game.]

----

A: Yes, very nice.

This is the final comment. Overall, I think a bit more fighting spirit would be good in your game. The white group in the centre really lived too easily. Play defensive moves only when they are very big. For example a move to protect the territory on the lower edge can easily be worth 30 points.]
