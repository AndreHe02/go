Hi,

I was white in this game. I'd appreciate a general commentary. I had some specific uncertainties regarding the situation on the right after B 39 and in the lower left after B 115.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[cj]LB[oc:a][od:b]C[Black 5 at A or B seems more natural to counter the influence of white 4.]
;W[po]LB[od:a][oc:b]C[In the same spirit, white 6 at A or B seems to work better with 4]
;B[qm];W[oq];B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[pn];B[qq];W[qn]LB[rl:a][ol:b]
C[white 14 is a thank you move that remove the possibility to play around A at a later time. if the goal is to build a wall, B is i think better than 14]
;B[rn];W[pm];B[jq]C[Correct answer from black, white 16 is not that much sente : black 1 is low and black can't hope for a big prospect on the right side anyways. So, black 17 is a good timing]
;W[gq]LB[hq:a]C[Correct direction to push black against your wall.  white 18 at A is even more severe]
;B[mq];W[rm]LB[nq:a][op:b]C[I Think  that it is giving up too easily the attack on the group b17-19, now black can link underneath and make his group safe.  White 20 at A or B keeps the pressure on black]
;B[so];W[or];B[np];W[op];B[pr];W[no]LB[ql:a]C[I think that here, I would take black 7 with A, securing your group and avoiding to give black good shape with white 26, black 27]
;B[mo];W[nn];B[hp];W[mn];B[lo];W[hq];B[ip];W[ql];B[oc]LB[cn:a]
C[Black 35 is good, black A is also playable];W[qf];B[ln];W[lm]
LB[mc:a][of:b]C[white 38 is not necessary, white could try A to weaken black's corner or B to increase his moyo]
;B[qh];W[of];B[oh];W[mg];B[rf];W[rg]C[
I was unsure what to do here, and for the next few moves.

A:  The problem here is that you allowed black easily into your moyo and after black 43, you can't avoid letting black connect.  Maybe 46 is too far and too close to black's strong position.]
;B[qg];W[re];B[pf];W[qe];B[pe];W[rd];B[qc];W[rh];B[oe]C[The result is not that bad locally for white (can't avoid black linking up but now, there's not much possibility of developpement for white 4 (black 5 on one side and a black wall on the other).  It's because of that I said earlier that attacking black 1 is more valuable.]
;W[qi]LB[ch:a][cl:b][fc:c]C[white 54 is really too small.  White has no prospect there anyways. white should try to use his corner stone, 4, to attack black 5 from one or the other side at B or A or make a corner enclosure calmly at C to counter black's wall, helping white 42 at the same time]
;B[nf];W[jc]C[white 56 not bad, in the right direction. but it's maybe a bit far considering black's wall]
;B[lc]LB[fc:a]C[black 57 is too shy, could be at A considering that the corner is empty]
;W[gc]C[good, defend lonely stone and corner enclosure];B[cn]
;W[cp];B[en];W[cd]LB[ce:a]C[not bad but maybe A is a bit more greedy : more corner and neutralise black 5 more]
;B[cg];W[df]LB[eg:a][ld:b]C[too passive, A extends more your side and goes deeper into blacks center. White A can be followed by B.]
;B[km];W[eh];B[ke];W[je];B[ec];W[fd];B[ed]
(;W[ee]LB[fe:a]C[You are really strong in this corner, black shouldn't live.  Playing A instead of 72 would avoid some of blacks forcing moves. See variation]
