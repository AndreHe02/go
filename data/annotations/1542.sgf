C[white: Hi, i'm Jorge Blanco, i won this game just because white did less mistakes than black, but mistakes left, i would like to be commented some strategic issues

Hope you find the comments through this game useful.  You are right B started out with a commanding position but wasn't able to keep it.   thanks  Robert]

;B[kc];W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[hc]
(;W[md]C[white: N16 i think brokes joseki, but i wasn另 sure which was the correct continuation and also black N16 scares me.

So far this is joseki.   W can play G15 or N16.  If W G15, B N15.  W can jump into the corner.  See sequence from b at previous move.]
;B[fq]C[B normally extends to F17 after W n16, so this should give W an opportunity to attack B at the top.]
;W[dn]C[white: i use to answer C6, but ...

C6, C7 I think are both played.];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[fc]C[Right!]
;B[gb];W[fb];B[hd]C[You can enclose B at the top.  See b sequence.]

(;W[ci];B[ck];W[ei]C[white: looking for territory too early? better from below?]
;B[ek];W[bm]C[This doesn't look the right shape to me. May be B7, which can connect underneath.

Generally you seem to be following B around the board.  B will keep pushing you around like this if he/she can.]
;B[gk];W[fo]C[white: just placed didn另 like];B[hf]C[See how W's group at M15 is coming under attack from B?

Try b instead of a]
(;W[ff];B[fe];W[ee];B[fd];W[ed];B[gf];W[nq]C[white: good to invade now here? better the fourth line?]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[kq];B[or]C[I think you have to complete your base with b in preference to C2. O3 group needs to be settled more.]

(;W[cr]C[white: was O2 obliged?];B[mr];W[nr];B[ns];W[mq];B[lr]

;W[kn]C[white: from here i just want to live, but i叮 just 13k so ...]
;B[im];W[nm];B[ol]C[a is way too slow.  Can't you push out with b etc.?]

(;W[lo];B[ke]C[B now launches the attack that H14 was a preparation for.]
;W[jf]C[white: i thought the low group was more or less alive

white: black L15 had to come, but i didn另 have time to link, i chose to have a dragon叫 fight, but now i think i should sacrifice the three white stones and play L14 and so on, expert opinion? ;-)

See my comments earlier about enclosing B.  That avoided the difficult stuation you now find yourself in.

If you chose the fight as you did, it becomes an exercise in reading skills.  But W is at a disadvantage of haveing 2 week groups and B has one week group.  Since W is behind I would fight.]
;B[lf];W[me];B[kf];W[if];B[ob];W[mg]C[white: i was scare, two white dragons can另 run as fast as one black dragon!

That's right.];B[kh];W[ih]C[B should have run out with L10.  W will have to work to connect J12.  One sequence starting after b looks nasty for W.]

(;B[gh];W[ij];B[kj];W[jl];B[jm];W[kl];B[km];W[lm];B[ll];W[ml]
C[white: chosing white move and the fight after honestly was too much for me a 13k]

(;B[ik]C[white: white happy

Yes B should have played a.];W[jj];B[jk]
(;W[jh]C[white: i don另 know if it was neccesary, but ...

if you don't you would lose more stones in the center.];B[nl]
;W[qc]C[white: i don另 know if i had to answer below and i neither know if it is the right move

By now you can see B's power is dominating the board.  B has one group (apart from the 4 stones at L15).  W has 4 groups.  I think you need to stay aware of the large scale developments to prevent your opponent getting such an upper hand.

Invading on the 3rd line on the right might be a way to get back into the game.]
;B[qd]C[b etc. may be one way to live in the corner.]
(;W[pc];B[oc];W[od];B[nb];W[mm]C[white: i didn't like the invation, so ...]
;B[mo];W[oo];B[po];W[rd]C[I think B should have blocked W and let W fight the ko to live.  It's more important to protect B's right side   Are you sure W N7 group is alive?]

(;B[oe];W[of]C[This is an overplay.  O15 looks more reasonable leading to more invasion possibilities on the RHS]
;B[nd];W[pg]C[white: overplay as black saw];B[nf];W[mf];B[og]
;W[rf];B[rh]C[b looks better to me.]

I don't think Q19 is needed.];B[nj]C[take the ko at p16...]

(;W[mh];B[on];W[nn];B[lq];W[lp];B[os];W[ms]C[thow in after L1 if you could get the chance.]
;B[ls];W[ks];B[ms];W[no];B[jp];W[ir]C[white: yes, but it looks so linked that even black didn另 realise :-)]

C[white: white happy];W[ca];B[ba];W[ac];B[ab];W[da];B[ad];W[be]
;B[ef];W[fg]C[white: f**k!, i didn另 like to let E14, but i knew it could gave me problems ...

I think the approach is to keep an eye on the number of liberties that might develop.]
;B[eg];W[fh];B[cg]C[... so that b can be used to maintain a connection to the edge and keep the liberty count up.]

(;W[bg]C[white: i think wrong, would be better any other move.    See comments on previous move.]
;B[bh]
(;W[bf]C[white: again the situation is above my knowledge, perhaps would be better something like cutting at C12?]
;B[ch];W[bi];B[eh]C[i think a was part of the problem.  b keeps a as a liberty.]

(;W[gi];B[hi]C[white: it was for me a surprise, and i am not happy when i have surprises ...]
;W[fi];B[hh];W[ii];B[di];W[dj]C[white: from here i red (misred) the sequence as really happen, but that included a big black mistake, what i should do if we were both good players?]

(;W[cf]C[white: unneccesary, but ...

Without this move B can get a ko fight that W has to win to stay alive.  One not so careful sequence results in a seki.  See options on previous move.]
