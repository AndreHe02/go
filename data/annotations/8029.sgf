C[C: Hi, I'm about 2d based on playing in Tokyo, Japan. I'll mark my comments with a C, just so you know it's me. Just a small fyi, take what I say with a grain of salt. There's a lot of players out there stronger than me, so I'm by no means recommending the best moves! With that said, I'll do my best to analyze the game and try to point out where you could have done better.

Hello dear reviewer !

All the advice would be good to take so let me know on what I suck in this game (this will be a hard time for you :D there's a lot !)

Anyway, thanks for the time spent on this :)];B[pd];W[qo];B[dp]
;W[dd];B[op];W[pq]
(;B[pp]C[C: The first mistake of the game. P3 is the proper move.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[qr];B[oq];W[rq];B[kp]C[C: Now white's corner is too solid.]
;W[dj];B[cl]C[C: A bit far. If you want to play locally here, C6 or C7 is better, giving you the possibility of the solid enclosure with E3 later. However, that's probably too slow given the bottom right. You also might want to think about F17 here as well.]
;W[ck]C[C: A "thank you" move.];B[dl]C[C: Now black's position is perfect.]
;W[cg]C[C: Too slow from white, now his stones on the left look awkward.]
;B[fc]C[C: This move should be at D3. The top left is not yet important, as you can always reduce with the invasion at san-san.]
;W[ec]C[C: It seems that white is a territorial player.];B[fd]
;W[eb];B[jc];W[pj];B[qh]C[C: Same mistake as before, this should be at R13 or R14, forming the solid connection with the star stone on the top right. Overall though, it is still better to play D3.]
;W[og]C[C: I do not understand the meaning of this move from white.]
(;B[pf]C[C: Too passive! You should cut and start the fight.]
;W[ob]C[C: Another bad move from white.];B[oi];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]
;B[qd];W[rc];B[md];W[nc];B[cf]C[C: I see what you're trying to do, but it's probably better to attack the two white stones on the right side first.]

C[C: A mistake, you must extend at L11.];W[ki];B[jh];W[gg];B[ak]
;W[kh];B[jg]C[C: This sequence is painful for black.];W[je]
(;B[kg]C[C: It is better to capture the white stones.];W[al]
;B[bd]C[C: This move should be at C17, but either way the result is bad for black.]
;W[ff];B[ak]C[C: Unnecessary, it is better to save this move as a ko threat.]
;W[eg];B[cc];W[ce];B[be];W[hn];B[go]C[C: H5 is probably better if you want to cut.]
;W[ho];B[hp];W[gm];B[ip];W[fm]C[C: It would be better for white to connect solidly here.]

;B[in];W[im];B[io];W[hm];B[rj]C[C: Too passive! You can easily invade at R8 here.]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[rl];B[ql];W[rm];B[pl];W[pg];B[qg];W[oj];B[ni]
;W[nj];B[lj]C[C: A "thank you" move. O8 is the vital point of this shape, and is sente.]

;W[om];B[pn];W[pm];B[qn];W[qm]C[C: Losing the cutting stones is painful.]
;B[nd]C[C: N17 is the sente move in this position. You also have important endgame moves at S7 and O3, with the reverse sente moves at D18, F18, and S17 you should be keeping in mind.]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[mh];B[nh];W[qi];B[ri];W[qj];B[ng];W[hb]C[C: Maybe a misclick? I think white meant to play H19.]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[hc]C[C: Why not capture the stone at F18?];W[fb]
;B[gb];W[ga];B[gc];W[ba];B[bb];W[ca];B[cb];W[da];B[ac];W[sf]
C[C: White takes the sente moves perfectly after O16.];B[rf]
;W[se];B[re];W[sd];B[sg];W[nr];B[ln]C[C: S6 and N17 are the biggest move left. You can also look at J18 and M2 after that.]
;W[lm];B[ko];W[em];B[dn];W[kr];B[jr];W[ls];B[km];W[kl];B[ib]
;W[ld];B[mc];W[mb];B[me]C[C: Why not take the H18 stone after setting up the atari?]

;W[ge];B[hd]C[C: M19 is the biggest move left, but you should play S17 in sente first.]
;W[lf];B[cd];W[de];B[sj];W[sl];B[mf]C[C: Again, S16 followed by M19.]
;W[pi];B[ph];W[ka]C[C: Now white take the biggest move.];B[ja]

;W[ed];B[fe];W[ih];B[ig];W[tt];B[tt]C[C: Ok, just to summarize. At your level of play, I'd seriously consider putting in study time dedicated to ko fights. At the lower kyu ranks, ko fights don't happen that often and they're not that significant when they do. However, this game had a big example with another that could've popped up in the top right if you had cut. Ko threats are just that, threats. You have to consider every time you can capture the ko whether or not the threat is big enough. Especially in the early game, there are very few big ko threats on an empty board. This is why it's generally a bad idea to start ko fights early in the game. With that in mind, when you have the chance to win a big ko, by all means take it!

The other big thing I saw was your endgame. I know long games are tiring and when the end is in sight, you tend to break concentration a little. DON'T! The endgame alone can swing the game by 20 points if one player is not careful, and you had the chance to win back those 1.5 points up until the last 5 moves or so.

I know my comments sound a bit harsh, but you played very well in general. Keep at it and you'll hit 1d in no time.]
