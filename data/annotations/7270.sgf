AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Thanks for your review.

Hi, my name is Marek. I hope you will like the review.]PL[W]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[fd]LB[fc:A][jc:B]C[I would prefer A here, as it leaves less weakness behind. The move you played aims at the extension around B. If you don't intend to continue there (which is good, because white should keep sente in handicap game) then A seems better.]
;B[ci];W[nq];B[pq]C[I don't like this move, too defensive.]

(;W[kq]C[Usually, in three-handicap game, you are far too behind to be thinking about defense. Instead, just play various approach moves in other corners. If black comes back to attack the first stone, then you can do a double kakari, etc... See variation.]
;B[pm]LB[jc:C][qj:B][iq:A]C[Again, not a very good move. Black doesn't need to play here, because the corner is safe now. Instead he should turn to bigger points like A, B or C.]
;W[fq]TR[fd]C[Better at O17?

Yes, with the unfinished business you created with the marked stone, the top side is the most urgent.]
;B[dn];W[dr]LB[cq:A][hq:B]TR[fd]C[Again, better at O17?

This move shouldn't be played at all. It erases lot of potential white had in the corner and it still doesn't live, because after expected black at A if white plays elsewhere, then B splits white's groups and gives him a hard time.]
;B[cq];W[nc]
(;B[qf]LB[hc:A]C[Black should try to attack more here, what with the weakness at A. See variations.]

(;W[pb]LB[jc:C][mc:B][md:A]C[A bad move. Erases corner aji and welcomes black to separate white at A, B or C. Instead, white should play as in the variation.]

(;B[qc]C[Black is very timid the whole game.];W[kc]C[Slow, but white probably has to play here, because of the corner weakness, etc.]
;B[qj]LB[cc:C][hc:B][hq:A]C[Fuseki is over now. We can say that white was a lot more efficient because the board looks like the same number of moves was played by both sides, while in fact black has played three more moves! However, it's important not to forget that while black's stones are less efficient, his position is a lot more solid than white's so he is still ahead (by two stones at least I would say). The problem is, because black is strong and connected all over the board, white will get very little chance now to get points and/or destroy black's points, while black has very strong invasions at A, B and C. Therefore, it is apparant that game is going to be very hard for white now.]

(;W[ce]LB[qh:B][cl:A][hp:C]C[Very bad move. Doesn't protect corner (see black's followup) and makes black strong. Invasion at A or B, or defense at C looks much better.]

(;B[df];W[fo]LB[hp:C][jp:B][iq:A]C[This kind of protects white's groups, but invasion at A seems to end the game (although very hard fight follows). If black is too afraid to fight, he can play standard reduction starting with B and then turn to invading the top. Game would look very hard for white. Therefore, instead of this move, C seems a lot better.]

(;B[dk]LB[cc:B][hc:C][ne:D][iq:A]C[A big move, but not urgent as black's groups on both sides are alive. Instead A, B or C are good points. Also, D is very big key point for making center moyo.]
;W[hd]LB[ko:A]C[I do not understand why I have done this.

This is a good move, big and urgent. However, A is much more urgent and also bigger, so you should have played there.]
;B[qb]C[The corner move is very big, but it's only endgame. Very bad!]
;W[oo]LB[ko:A]C[Bad, still important to play at A.];B[hp]LB[iq:A]
TR[fo][fq][dr]C[Very good, although I would prefer to play at A. Notice, that you can't attack this stone very well, because your marked group is not that strong itself.]
;W[hn]
(;B[jo]
(;W[ko]C[It's usually bad to attach at enemy weak groups. You are making them strong, which is probably opposite of what you want to do. If you want to attack, then you have to try to surronud it somehow. See variation.]

(;B[jn]C[Not best];W[kn]
(;B[jm];W[hl]LB[jp:B][hr:A]C[Accordingly, connecting at A, or forcing at B is better. However, the game seems lost now for white.]
;B[kl]TR[hq][iq][jq][hr][ir][jr]C[Black plays very strangely. Surely playing in the marked area to cut white was best.]
;W[io]LB[jp:A]C[Not very good as after black plays A, white's own weaknesses will be exposed.]
;B[jp];W[ip];B[kp]LB[jq:A]C[Horrible! Must be at A to cut.]
;W[jq]TR[hp]C[White happily connects, having all his territory intact and black having a floating group. What started as a good plan with the marked stone, ended in the worst way imaginable for black.]
;B[lq];W[lr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lo]C[Very small, just captures two stones. There are a lot bigger places on the board.]
;W[np]C[Also small.];B[po]C[This is like one point gote...]
;W[ne]C[Good, this is a key point for developing both black's and white's moyos. Just imagine black would play there. This is what we call a key point and it is a place where both of you should have played since five moves ago.]
;B[on]C[Small.];W[nn]LB[be:A][gg:B][pg:C]C[I thing this is not good, this stone has had no use during the rest og the game.

Yes, it's good that you recognize that it's not an important move. Instead, something like A, B, C are huge.]
;B[nm]C[Again very small..];W[ng]LB[pg:A]C[Good, although you could push a little bit more at A, threatening to separate black's groups.]
;B[ph];W[kj]LB[gg:A]C[This isn't really doing anything. A is the keypoint.]
;B[mn]C[Small. Black probably fears that his center group will die, but it is connected, so it can't really die, can it?]
;W[ff]LB[gg:A]C[Good, but could be better at A.];B[fm]C[Small.]
;W[gi]C[White gained so many points in the last couple of moves. It's like black was just passing.]
;B[ik];W[ii];B[mi];W[lh];B[fh];W[gh];B[fi];W[be]LB[cc:A]C[This is very big and should have been played a lot sooner (remember there was an invasion at A up until this move.]
;B[bf];W[cr];B[br]C[Black just follows white around the board. Instead, he should take sente and play his own moves.]
;W[lk];B[nh];W[og]LB[og:B][nh:A][nk:C]TR[lk]C[A-B, strange exchange, why was it played? Surely after the marked move black must defend his territory and not tenuki to A. And white must jump to C, not play a pass at B.]

Black: 98 territories + 10 prisoners = 108
Result: B+4.5

Let's summarize the game now. In the fuseki, white was faster than black, but not fast enough and black ended with very solid position, giving white a very hard game to come. To reiterate, white cannot hope to win the handicap game by playing normally. He has to be very fast, complicate situations, keep black busy. That's the only way.

In the midgame, both players ignored the most urgent invasion points and played rather small moves. Later black invaded the bottom and had he succeeded, the game would be over. However, for some reason he threw all that away and let white connect. Nevertheless, he didn't really lose anything and still kept his 30+ points of advantage. However, then came the late midgame and black (and also white in lesser extent) played very small moves, not noticing the key points. That's how white managed to get his center territory and greatly reduce black's lead. Last but not least, black answered every white's sente endgame move, which is a very bad style showing no fighting spirit and losing a lot of points. In the end white almost won, although not so much because of his skill as because of black's bad play).]

(;B[bb]LB[db:A][eb:B]TR[dc]C[After the A-B exchange, black has this move to make ko for life in the corner. However, here it doesn't work. But still, I think it's a useful thing to know. At least, you should learn to avoid moves like the triangled stone. They help black a lot in this situations (that is, in the corners where you are very strong around).]
