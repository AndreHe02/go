C[I think this is an unusual  placement for white.  This would be a standard pattern for a stone on the 4-4  point being approached by a small knight extention.

But as it is I think you don't put any pressure on black.

I prefer "a" or a pincer attack.];B[oo]C[See Black wants to run  into the middle anyways, a pincer would have doing that while attacking.]
;W[rp]C[Very small move at this point of the game.  If you had pincered black  then he could count on one eye on the edge an find another in the center.   Running into the corner would be small for black if you got the side.  And  you can easily live on the bottom with a few extra moves.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[pj]C[A Pincer would have stopped this at the expense of a little territory in  the corner.  But You would have influence on bottom and center in exchange.]
;W[qh]C[The question to ask is where would black like to go next?  The best  answer I can see is D10 becauseit takes an entire side and still leaves room  for an extension up one of the side.

The best move for white is d10.  White can jump to one side or the other and  easily get a living shape.

The Second best place for white it either F16 or K16.  F16 will get pincered  but that's okay.  K16 I think is too slow.

K4 is even slower.];B[oe]C[This is a mistake.  I don't know what it is trying  to do.  If it is trying for territory then it counts on white making big  mistakes.]
;W[od]C[A good response, but still d10 is bigger.];B[nd];W[oc];B[pe];W[qe]
;B[nf];W[qj]C[Chamelon said "Should be n17"
I disagree.  The corner is alive and n17 is too slow of an extension.  It  gains territory yes, but there are bigger points to be had.

Don't be afraid to tenuki.  If the stones will live as they stand,(or can  easily become that way if attacked) then look for a bigger point.]
;B[qk]C[Black should have ignored this and played D10];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl]
L[qi]M[rl]C[The marked stone does little to gain territory and the safty of  this group would better be served by playing "a"

But to point out what this is really about.  White and Black are arguing  about maybe 5 points (I can't count very well yet) and there are much  bigger points to be taken.]
;B[qg];W[rg]C[Too many holes in White's formation  for this series of moves.]
;B[qi];W[qf]L[pg]C[Not sure what White is afaid of  to go R14.  The stones at S9 and S8 are about to be cut off.

A move like "a" would have been better.  The stone R13 would easiyl be  captured and it would be making inroads on Black area.  Even though Black is  strong here and should be left alone.]
;B[pg];W[pi];B[rj];W[ri];B[ph];W[qj];B[pc];W[sj]L[pd]C[Big mistake.  Corner worth more than the side.   And there are other big places to make ko threats with if you insist on  playing here.

The move to make here was Q16 or "a"];B[oi];W[pd]C[Fortunately Black let you play  there.]
;B[qi];W[rj];B[rh];W[sh];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[na];B[ma];W[pb]C[This is not a fair trade at all!
Black has got tremdous influece across the top and center of the board.  A  play at D10 will cinch the game for him.]
;B[lc];W[fq];B[dj]C[Now that Black got  the side, White needs to think big here and figure out a way to take some  territory back.  But he has to build influence first.  Terretory follows  thickness.

Black is probably looking at k10 or something like that.];W[dq];B[cp]L[fp]C[This is the wrong move for black.

Black should let White take some of the corner.  A move at F4 or "a" would  give him even more of the center and side.  Black can still crawl into the  corner.]
;W[cg]C[Wouldn't it have been nicer to invade before D10 was there.];B[cj]
;AW[fo]C[Why through C13 out there and then leave it alone?];B[ep];W[dn]
L[fp]C[A knight move is better for staking out territory not  for makeing a good connection to attack.

Black can push through these stones easily leaving one group or the other  stranded, while he builds a wall.

White should have protected his side by going "a"];B[fp]C[He pushes through.

White strategy now should be to eat as much of the center up as possible  while building a big bottom side.  Some point in there White should try to  complete the invasion at C13.  Perhaps by going F17.  Surely White can live  in the corner or on the outside of it.]
;W[gq];B[go];W[fn];B[cn];W[cm]C[White  can't capture Black nor can he get enough room to to get even one eye on the  side.  He had better run to the center.  But it looks bad.]
;B[bn];W[gl];B[el];W[em];B[dl];W[dm]C[C7 is dead weight.  Let it go.  Sometimes you need to  sacrafice stone to make a strategy work.  Don't be so in love with all your  stones.  If they are dead or the do you no good, quit playing to make them  survive.  It only works against you.]
;B[be];W[im];B[lp]C[The biggest point is  still in the Center.];W[gp];B
[ho];W[ip];B[jq];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir];B[mr];W[nr];B[jo];W[io];B[fc];W[cc];B
[dc];W[ce]C[I don't think this is good at  all.  Let C13 die.  If you try to link up to it, then the whole group will  die.]
;B[cd];W[cf];B[bc];W[gh];B[ee];W[ef];B[id];W[bi];B[bl];W[ej]C[Not sure  what this stone's purpose is.  Capture Black?  Link up to other group?

The other group is alive and so is the first.  Black can't be killed.  Even  though he looks loose, he's got too much running room and the corner is open.]

;B[il];W[ik];B[jl];W[hj];B[jm];W[jj];B[kj];W[ji]C[Black is trading one side of the center  for another.

I think White is only thinking of little groups and not of big picture.  To  afraid of his group dying and not making the big move.

If you group is alive then time to play elsewhere if you aren't getting  anything by playing locally.]

;B[po];W[nl];B[ok];W[mm];B[ro];W[rn];B[rq];W[rr];B[sp];W[kn]C[Big mistake!  This is a thank you move.  Black would love to close at  k6 and L6 gives him the excuse.

If Black gets to go j6 then he has saved his g6 stones and kill a lot of  white's stones in the process.]
;B[jn];W[mo];B[nn]C[Fortunetly for White,  Black missed it.];W[nm];B[op]
;W[oq];B[sr];W[qs];B[mp];W[np];B[mq];W[pr]C[White is alive even without this move.  Connecting to M5 would be better.   Especially cause it seals Blacks doom on side.]
;B[nk]C[Here's my opportunity to  save those stones.  -Alf];W[mk]C[Blew it! -Alf]
;B[in]C[Uh oh. Black  Kills a lot of White];W[cq]C[Trying to save some portion of the corner (and  maybe cut off E4 group if the chance arises).  -Alf]
;B[bq];W[br]C[The  weakness in this move is that Black will push through at E3 and there is  nothing White can do about the corner then.  So B2 is a wasted stone.]
;B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[es]C[If black were to go f1 and sacrafice F1 and F2, it would  set up a good kill of the corner by going d2 next.  White would have to give  something up.

The better move for white is to connect solidly at d2.];B[gr];W[cr];B[hr]
