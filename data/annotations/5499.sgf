C[hi~
I played poorly at the opening so that I have to kill those black stones at top right.

Thank you for spending time for making this review~


AB: Hello, I am Arnaud Boucherie (3k on IGS and KGS, playing as ExplO). I will start my comments with AB.


I don't think that black played better than you before you killed his group. This win was not undeserved.

I hope this review will help.];B[dp];W[pd];B[cd];W[pp];B[dj]
;W[ec]MA[ed][pj]C[AB: So far so good. E16 and Q10 are other possibilities.]
;B[ed];W[fd];B[ee];W[dc];B[cc];W[ic];B[jp];W[fe]MA[nq]C[AB: I think M3 is more urgent as it threatens to invade black's moyo adn takes territory. Also black can consider tenuki after your move to play O3. I don't think you have any good follow up if black plays tenuki.]
;B[ef];W[qj]C[AB: I still think M3 is more important, but R10 is a very good point too.]
;B[nc]C[AB: Playing at O3, expanding the black moyo and reducing the white moyo would be normal.]
;W[oc]C[AB: The correct answer, black cannot get the 3 space extension and your group on the left is strong.]

(;B[ne]C[AB: This move is weird.];W[pf];B[kc]C[AB: Now the o15 stone would be much better at O16.]
;W[nb];B[mb];W[mc];B[nd]
(;W[lb]C[This is a poor move, I think I can do better by playing at M16, and aim to cut black into two groups.

AB: I disagree, M18 is a large move and it keeps the black group weak. See variation if you play at M16.]
;B[lc];W[ma];B[md];W[kb]C[AB: Tenuki is also possible.];B[ke]
;W[ie]C[AB: This move is really slow. Black can no longer attach at J16 to make his group stronger, but black has plenty of room to escape so it's hard to attack him even he does not answer your move.]
;B[nq];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq]C[AB: This move is big but slow. Invading the black moyo at F3 or C6 is better.]
;B[gq]C[up to now, I find that black has a large territories at the left and bottom. I dont really know how to reduce it.

AB: Black's shape at the bottom is thin and not so good so he cannot keep the territory if you invade.
G3 is an horrile move for two reasoons:
- Black wanted the Q2/R3 exchange so he should defend against the invasion at M3 by playing o5 for example. If you invade at M3 before the Q2/R3 exchange is played, black can treat O3 lightly and sacrifice it to invade the corner. Now that the Q2/R3 exchange is played, if you invade at M3, O3 and Q2 may become a burden for black
- G3 does not defend the corner very much. If you invade the corner soon, you will get a conformatable life and the G3 stone will become almost useless.]
;W[lp]MA[jp][nq]C[AB: The vital point to invade the marked formation is M3. After M4, black can easily link up his stones so your move does not accomplish much.]
;B[lq];W[kq];B[kp];W[mq];B[lr];W[mp];B[mr];W[oq]C[AB: O4 is the only move. Your corner is already very strong, the black groupe is strong, and you already played R3 to defend the corner so taking one stone is quite small. See variation for next move.]

(;B[np];W[mn];B[dm];W[or];B[nr];W[jf]C[AB: If you invade at C3 black gets nothing and either G3 or D7 will be too close to the wall. You should aim the invasion at c3 whenever you can.]
;B[kf];W[lm]C[AB: The wrong direction. O13 is attacking the black group and increasing the moyo at the same time.]
;B[kn];W[km];B[ln];W[mo]MA[lp][mp][mq]C[AB: The marked stones at not cutting anything so you can easily sacrifice them. O13 is still a good point.]
;B[in];W[dd];B[ce];W[de];B[df];W[ng]C[AB: If you don't intend to cut after pushing, you should not push in the first place. The d17 groups lost a liberty in the process while the problem is still the same for black.]
;B[ff];W[gf];B[cb];W[eb];B[kh];W[lg];B[kg];W[jm];B[im];W[jj]
;B[cq];W[hh]C[AB: Black is sure that he can save his dragon.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[jd];W[je];B[lf];W[mf];B[me];W[ld];B[of];W[og]
;B[id];W[hd];B[kd];W[hb];B[mh];W[mg];B[lh];W[no]C[AB: The aji is really bad so I think you should had a move around M10 instead. If the black group is clearly dead there is no way you can lose this game.]
;B[jg]C[AB: I cannot find to way for black to live but it's always hard to cleanly kill such a big group. You handled it well.
