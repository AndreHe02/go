C[siowy:
Hi Freddy. Enjoy the review.];B[pd]C[Hi];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[dp]C[Avalanche chosen to build influence against the other komou and support a general hostile takeover of his side from the word go.


siowy:
I'm not familiar enough with avalanche joseki to comment.

It's fine as long as you know the main variations.];W[dq];B[co]
;W[cq];B[fp];W[bo];B[cn]LB[de:a][df:b][cf:c][ce:d]C[siowy:
This result is even.

In the opening, always be mindful of the approaches to the 3-4 point, as they are of great importance. 

If b can get A, B or C, it would be an approach to the corner while helping greatly to build a moyo on the left side.

Therefore the correct direction is for w to play an enclosure now in the UL, either at C or D.]
;W[qf]C[siowy:
Mistake.

See previous move for explanation.];B[qh];W[of]LB[qc:a]C[siowy:
For w to jump into the corner at A is fine too.];B[nd]
(;W[rd]LB[qc:a]C[siowy:
Mistake.

After the natural defense at A, possibility of later going to san-san, A, in the corner is gone. In other words, the exchange of this move and b's A is good for b.

One of the simpler joseki continuations is shown as a joseki from the previous move.]
;B[qc];W[nh]LB[de:a][ic:b][qh:a][qk:b][og:c][pi:d][pj:e]C[A bit lighter than I would have expected. Still merits a response, so I treat it like it was one line lower. Was this wise or should I have tenuki'd say to A or B


siowy:
<for w>
Mistake.

The shape of the w stones here is not good. Later, b can aim for C, which strains the keima connection and the one-space jump connection.

Better to try to press A down while gaining influence by playing D.

<for b>
A response here is necessary to prevent w from attacking A.

One simple response is to defend A at B or at E(as in the game), the result of which is good for b.

Afterwards, when b is strong on the right side, b can aim at C to punish w's weak shape. See the variation.]
(;B[pj]C[siowy:
Good.];W[kc]LB[mc:a][kc:b][of:c][ke:d][le:e][ld:f]C[Looking back this seems sente.but A seems too passive.

siowy:

A is too submissive and b no longer has good access to the centre after w jumps up to D or E. Equally importantly, A does not separate B from the C group. 

On another note, there is a proverb that goes: Sente is only sente if your opponent agrees.

See variation for suggested move, F.]
(;B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[bd];B[di]LB[cf:a][cg:b]C[Blind arrogance, thinking only of the ladder at A, not the clamp which followed in reality. B might have been better but I think I would have been invaded outright in response.


siowy:

Yes B is the only move here to make shape, not only to defend against the clamp, which also to defend against w's B in future and to nearly make an eye at A.]
;W[bg]C[siowy:
w can also leave the clamp for later to destroy territory, instead of possibly making b thicker immediately.]
;B[cf]C[saving the stone.];W[af];B[bh]LB[cg:a][cf:b][bh:c]C[trying out the clamp (hindsight says that it wouldn't work anyways) and defending my moyo on the lower left.


siowy:
Mistake.

After A, b's groups B and C are separated.];W[cg]
(;B[dg]LB[ch:a]C[aiming to build influence. not sure which is better, my move or A or was it a rock and a hard place?

siowy:
I show some variations from A.

This move is good.];W[ch]
(;B[ci]C[Defending the side. this itoo greeedy. Variation seems better.

siowy:
This is better than in the variation. It avoids cutting points.]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[ai]LB[ah:a][dh:b]C[siowy:
Mistake.

Better to capture at A instead to prevent b from playing B to connect in sente.]
;B[aj]LB[dh:a]C[siowy:
Mistake.

Much bigger to connect at A.];W[ah]LB[ck:a][dh:b][cf:c][ci:d]
C[A and B both scream to be played here my thought at the time was that he'd erase from below. Massive error.

siowy:
B is crucial to prevent w from separating groups C and D. See the variation.

A is much less important.]
(;B[bn]C[siowy:

Slow move. Adding stones to groups which are already strong or alive just for territory is usually wrong in the opening or middle game. It should be reserved for endgame.]
;W[nq];B[lq]LB[lp:a][pn:b][qn:c][of:d]C[I think this pincer has better alternatives considering I'm practically asking to be attacked with it.


siowy:
The high pincer at A works better with the moyo growing at the left.

Otherwise, responding simply at B or C is also good for strengthening the right side, which is put b in a better position to attack the D group.]
;W[no];B[pn];W[jq]LB[jq:a][nq:b]C[point and case.

siowy:
It is important for b to jump out now, thus attacking both groups A and B.

See variation.]
(;B[hc]TR[kc]LB[of:a][ld:b][dh:c][eh:d][eg:e]C[trying to put pressure on the marked stone without too much threat to my own.

siowy:
Good idea.

But it's important to prevent the w stone from connecting to the A group first by playing something around B.

It is also worth noting that the push-and-cut at CDE is getting more dangerous.]
;W[fd]LB[ke:a][nd:b]C[his attack commences, splitting the stone off from the group and focing a response.

siowy:
Better to jump directly to A, running closer to safety while pressuring the B group.]
;B[he];W[ke]C[he seems to have to defend here as allowing me this point puts that stone and his erasure attempt at risk.

siowy:
Yes jumping out here is necessary.]
(;B[nj]LB[nh:a][lg:b][ke:c][pd:d][dh:e][lq:f]C[I don't even remember why I played this move. it seems akward in hindsight.

siowy:
Think about stones as flowing water. By playing this stone, you guide w's A group (the river) towards B, naturally connecting it to
C.

Right now in the game, b's D group is in great danger of dying, the weakness at E is becoming more important, and F is under attack. It is better to tend to any one of these urgent situations.]
;W[mf];B[mc];W[oc]C[devastatingly perfect.

siowy:
Not sure if this is right. It's basically a life and death problem in this area.]

C[I should have sealed off that point a long time ago.];B[eg]
LB[eh:a][eg:b][he:c]C[this instead of A because of the cut. Alas it only leads to greater misery.

siowy:
Good idea. But I think after w'a A, the B and C groups need to connect and run to try to live.]
;W[eh];B[fe]LB[fd:a][de:b][he:c]C[siowy:
Great move to connect B and C while putting pressure on A.]
;W[gd];B[hd]LB[ge:a][hc:b]C[siowy:
Important mistake.

It was important to instead connect at A, sacrificing B, after which b can run much more easily.

The situation in the UL is that b needs to run away. Now imagine that you are running, and you are carrying a large sack of potatoes over your back. It is difficult to run fast. Instead, all you need to do is to drop the sack of potatoes, and you can run more easily.

B is the sack of potatoes here. It represents a sizeable number of points if w captures it, but connecting here to save it slows down b's escape greatly. Learn to sacrifice the tail end when running.]
;W[ge]LB[hd:a][eg:b][gh:c]C[siowy:
Good by w.

Here there are two options for w. 

The first is the move played, which aims to separate A and B which are both in danger, thus killing one of them.

The second option is to attack the entire UL side by playing around C. It may not work.]
;B[gf];W[ee]LB[hf:a][eg:b][hd:c]C[siowy:
Mistake.

Cutting at A is crucial. After A, either B or C group dies.]
;B[fg]LB[fe:a]C[siowy:
Superb move, sacrificing the useless A stone.];W[ff];B[hg]C[siowy:
Good move.];W[if];B[hf];W[fi]C[the first move towards my moyo.]
;B[ek]SQ[nj]C[this move feels like I'm bending over backwards to let him in. In reality I intended just to keep what I could and fight for the center using the marked stone.]
;W[gk];B[fj]LB[fj:a][gi:b][gf:c]C[siowy:
Important Mistake.

The exchange of A for B greatly reduces the chance of survival for C.]

siowy:
Good idea.];W[mn];B[mm]LB[ln:a]C[siowy:
Connecting against the peep at A is usually correct, and is correct here.]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[li]TR[if][gi][gk][nh][mf][ke]LB[hf:a]C[sculpting out a moyo can be the only reason I see for this move.

Good idea to ensure the kill here, since killing C wins the game, but better around A or B to ensure the kill.]

;W[kd];B[fb]C[diving for an eye.];W[eb];B[ip]C[I panicked and defend the moyo at this point. The group up top is urgent now, if it can even still be saved.

LB[kr:a]C[A connection move, which I deem useless as connecting along here or at A was miai.]

LB[om:a]C[Black resignes here.
There is no way for the group to live, if there ever was.
I think if the group lived the game was mine. if I live in sente A seals offf my side and it just comes down to how much I can erase with the marked stone and how much he can push down from the top along the X'd border.

It was a good game. Hope the review was of help. You can email me at siowyisheng@gmail.com if you have further questions.]
