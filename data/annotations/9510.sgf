C[Hi, I'm Anand. I'm about 8-9kyu on IGS, though I haven't played in a while. I will review for Black.

I will try to give comments which are frank and direct. Please do not take this as insults. No offence is intended.

At the outset, I will say that Black seems to have won this game very easily, therefore this is not a good game to review. You should usually ask for reviews in games where you have lost, or the game is very close. Nevertheless, I will try to give some pointers.

I have indicated many variations throughout the game. They are not always flagged, so use a game viewer which shows them.

I have made some comments at the very end.];B[pd]C[Three basic things to keep in mind:

1. Corners, sides, center. That should be order of play.

2. Stabilize your groups before attacking. Don't create two weak groups.

3. Don't automatically respond to opponent. Play big moves if opponent makes a small threat.]

;W[ni];B[oh];W[ln];B[co]TR[dp][bo]C[The rule for these kinds of moves are "If you push into a keima (marked), you have to cut". Since cutting at B4 is pointless, you have only strengthened white for no benefit at all.]
