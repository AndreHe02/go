TM[1800]

C[Extreme thanks to whomever reviews this game. This was my first game on the KGS server. I had only played one other game of Go online and was humiliated. I decided to study more before attempting another human player. These where my humble results. I'm looking for any major mistakes that I have made, and ideas of subjects to study to improve my game. Again thank you for any assistance It's truly appreciated.

Todd Werner: Travis, I'll be reviewing this game for you. I play on IGS as yearofglad. I'll preface my comments with "**TW:" throughout.

One thing I'm going to focus on during this game is life and death, which is (obviously) one of the most important concepts in go. A good, solid understanding of when a group is alive and when a group is dead can improve your game by leaps and bounds.

The second thing I'm going to focus on is, simply put, the ability to find the most valuable move. One thing that still stumps me about higher-ranked players is how they decide to move away from the location "where all the action is" and play elsewhere. Good players have a sense of when it is worth it to move on to a new fight.

Last thing, before we get started - thanks for submitting the game for review! It, in addition to your comments above, show that you have a willingness to learn.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pq];B[pj];W[pm]C[**TW: I assume your intent with this move was to maybe get some territory in the lower right, as well as attack black's Q10?  Keep that in mind - this stone is good. It has a dual function of working towards territory and also attacking. (Although, it is too far away from Q3 - R6 is better.)]
;B[on];W[dj]C[**TW: This is the first problematic move, and you actually end up asking a question about the problems D10 causes, although you may not realize it.

If the point of Q7 was to try to build territory as well as attack Q10, letting black split it here is bad. Play Q6. Start building a strong wall. That wall, besides helping you gain points, will help you more effective attack Q10 and P6.]
;B[ke];W[mp]TR[nc][qf][fc]C[**TW: This move is ok (although probable better down one at N3 - you're stretching yourself very thin in the lower right) but an invasion near any of the triangle points is probably better at this stage.]
;B[pn]C[**TW: This is the move that causes you trouble. By ignoring P6 and allowing black to cut you here, you basically sacrificed Q7.]
;W[om];B[nn];W[mo]C[**TW: This move seems focused on attacking black, which is not a bad idea, but you can't effectively fight black with your two weak stones on line 7. A move like N5 actually pushes black TOWARD your white stones.

You're going to have a hard time living with your two white stones on line 7 as it is.]
;B[no];W[mn];B[nm];W[qn];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql];W[np];B[rn];W[qo]
;B[ro];W[rp];B[rl];W[sn]TR[qp]C[In this position could I have avoided the next few captures?

**TW: Yes; T6 serves no purpose other than forcing black to capture S7, which is dead anyway. A better move is to protect your stones that still have a chance at living, probably just be firmly connecting them at R4.]
;B[sm];W[so]C[**TW: This move is wasted - a quick read sees that these stones will also die. This is a move for White that would be better spent elsewhere.]
;B[sp];W[ol]C[**TW: What was the goal with this move? Was it to try to escape? If so, that's fine - it'll be a tough escape, but good practice. The reason I ask is because of the next two moves.]
;B[nl]C[**TW: I would assume, when you played P8, that you assumed black would follow with O8. You should always think about what a player's response will be to your moves.  So, assuming you guessed black's O8... (go to next move)]
;W[cf]C[**TW: Why then abandon your three white stones? You can't have it both ways. If you want to try to save the white stones, try to save them. If you think they're beyond hope (they are), then abandon them immediately. Don't let black get free strength by encouraging him to play O8.

Note that there's nothing wrong, on its own, with C14. It's a good attack on the corner and works nicely with your other stones on the left hand side.]
;B[cg]C[**TW: This move is very aggressive by black.]
(;W[df]C[**TW: I'm of two minds about this move.  I'd say what you should really be doing is trying to "settle" your white group and give it "eyespace."  In other words, work along the edge of the board and try to gain some room to make eyes with your white stones.  I put in a variation.]
;B[dg];W[de]MA[df][cf]C[**TW: A couple times you've made this triangle shape - this is a very bad shape and should be avoided at almost all costs.  If you want to attack D16, do it closer to the edge at C16.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[ch]C[**TW: As a side note, this is also a bad move for black - he makes the same triangle.]
;W[be]
(;B[bd];W[ed];B[ee];W[ef]C[**TW: Good.  I was glad to see you do this, rather than capture D16 immediately.  This keeps your group open to the middle and keeps some pressure on black's three stones.]
;B[ff];W[fe];B[cc];W[dc];B[ec];W[bc]C[**TW: Why here instead of F17?]
;B[cb];W[ad];B[bb];W[ae]TR[nc][qf][kc][cm][jp]C[**TW: This was the first of what I saw were many moves that seemed to indicate you were scared of groups being captured, or black playing someplace... I don't see the point of this move - I don't know what it was meant to accomplish.

Each time you make a move like this, you've wasted an opportunity.  Which looks better, the stone where it is, or the stone at any of the marked places?

Notice some of the triangles are invasions, and some are strengthening your current positions. However, they are ALL worth exponentially more than A15.]
;B[ab]
(;W[ac]C[**TW: What happens if you let black play A17 instead of you? Check the variation.]
(;B[il];W[fd]C[**TW: If you want to continue in this direction, F17 is better.

However, here, your white group is totally alive. No need to worry about it. Time to strike out somewhere new with bigger, broader moves.

As I said in the opening comments, figuring out when to move on to a new attack or region is difficult, but one of the SURE signs is when the group you are playing near is alive.  If you're playing near a living group, like F16 does, your moves should be bold, aggressive, and expansive - F16 is too slow.]
;B[fj];W[dd]LB[bd:1][ce:2][ee:3]C[**TW: Again, I don't see the point of this move.  I don't mean to harp on it, but ask yourself, upon review of this game, "What was the point of D16?"

Your white group has eyes.];B[di];W[db]CR[di][fj][il]TR[dd]
[fd]C[**TW: Again, too slow. Look at the moves black has made compared to your last three. His moves are broad, and D11 attacks your weak white stone. Black's moves are not great, but the idea is right!]
;B[da];W[ea];B[ca];W[aa]C[**TW: Why play here? The group is dead. There is no urgency to play here. Play E18 to protect E19.]
;B[ba];W[aa];B[lm]C[After this stone could I have played to take this corner?

**TW: The lower right corner?  Yes.];W[sq];B[so];W[ok]MA[qp]
[rq]C[**TW: From the last time you played with those white stones, black has built up more and more strength to the middle. You've now played to those stones twice.

Here, again, you end up with problems because you have weakness in the lower right at the Xs.]
;B[oj];W[qk];B[pk];W[nk];B[mj];W[mm];B[mk];W[km];B[nj];W[ll]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[kn];W[jn];B[pl];W[ko];B[qg]C[**TW: This is a devastating move by black, threatening a lot of territory - it's the kind of move you should have played earlier instead.]
;W[ol]C[**TW: Again, what was the point of this move?

I assume you will agree that it is evident you cannot live in there, so then my assumption must be that this was an attacking move.  Attacking what? Black's group has more eyes than I can count.]
;B[ok];W[jm]TR[nc][hp][ej][cm]C[**TW: Extending way too slowly from a living group. If you want to attack J8, do it firmly, but there are far better options at the triangles - again, some attacking, some more passive.]
;B[om]C[**TW: This move by black was unnecessary - black seemed as scared of losing his group as you were confident in attacking it. Avoiding this TYPE of move will make you far better.  Imagine a game of go in which you, at a dozen times during the game, simply say to your opponent, "I'm going to the restroom; take two moves in a row. I don't mind."

Unthinkable!

But that's what's happening here.

(Yes, I realize you are white and not black, but black provides such a good talking point that I couldn't pass it up.)]
;W[ln]C[**TW: But you respond in kind! Thiis group is so strong and alive, have nothing to worry about.]
;B[ie];W[kl]TR[kj][jj][ki]C[**TW: This, I think, upon reaching this point in my review, is one of the areas which you can (relatively) easily correct and which will provide you with great gains. This move is too slow - if you want to attack black in the center (invading on the upper side is still better), try something more aggressive.  Don't proceed one stone at a time from a strong, living group.  Use it's strength!]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[fg];W[he];B[gd];W[hd];B[gc];W[fc];B[hf];W[gb]
;B[gg]
(;W[hg]C[**TW: Here, you gave away all the white stones you spent your last 4 turns playing. You're moving on to a new attack before the previous one is finished.  H17 here saves your white stones, but you left them to be captured.  See variation.]
;B[hc];W[if];B[gf];W[je];B[id];W[eb]C[**TW: Why capture E17? It can't do any harm, and now you've abandoned your stones in the center.]
;B[eg];W[ic];B[hh];W[ig];B[jf];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[ld];W[kc]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[lc]
(;W[ja]C[J18 kills the group.];B[ia]C[**TW: This is a mistake by black. He should simply play J18 and capture your J17.]
;W[ib];B[ka];W[jb]C[**TW: Why retreat and defend when M19 captures black's attacking stone instead? Don't be too hasty to retreat.]
;B[hb];W[ha];B[la];W[ga]C[**TW: This move doesn't accomplish anything.  Use your newfound strength to keep attacking M19 with M18.]
;B[nd];W[kf]C[**TW: This is good.  Strike at black's weak point.]
;B[jg];W[le];B[ih]
(;W[ke]C[**TW: No need to fill in here.  Keep attacking!  Keep using that strength. I put in a couple quick variations.]
;B[qe];W[ig]C[**TW: These black stones are clearly alive. I think you are trying to replicate the move that kills a "bent 3" shape - that only works if the group already doesn't have 2 eyes. A move like J13 as no hope of capturing anything.]
;B[jh];W[gq]C[**TW: Good reinforcing move. I would continue to attack on the upper side, using your strong white group, but this is a solid move.]
;B[fp];W[bq]C[**TW: I think you got scared that black was going to somehow invade and take the corner.  F3 is the right response to black's F4. Play against it solidly - you have the upper hand here in the corner because you already have 2 well-positioned stones, but a move like B3 makes it seem as if you are on the defensive, rather than offensive.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[fq];W[gp];B[fr];W[gr];B[gs];W[fo];B[dq];W[cq]
;B[dr];W[cp];B[es];W[hs];B[ds];W[fs];B[cr];W[gs];B[bs];W[br]
;B[ar]C[Could I have stopped him forming those eyes?

**TW: He doesn't have two eyes. His group is dead and should have been removed at the end of the game. Check the variation starting at the next move. Black's only eye is at E2. He will eventually have to fill in A1 and C1.]
(;W[ir]SQ[kq][jq]TR[ko][lo][mo][mn][ln][mm][mp][np]C[Play up higher, like J4. If you're worried about an invasion under the marked group, play around L3 or K3.]
;B[jq]C[**TW: Black takes the point you should've taken. However, with the strength of your white groups all around, you should be able to kill his stone/group.]
;W[hq]C[**TW: This move is wasted. Attack black - don't let him get settled. Even if he plays H3, what will happen?]
;B[ip];W[jr];B[kk];W[jo]LB[lm:1][kn:2]C[**TW: There's no reason to connect here. If you want to attack black's stones, do it. Play at J5 or L3.

There's no reason to connect because your white group(s) already have two shared eyes, as marked.

Also, note that if you wanted/needed to connect them, a move at J5 connects them just as well (black can't play into K5 without you simply capturing it) and a move like J5 also attacks the black stones.

Again, you're playing as if black has a strong group and you have a weak one, rather than the other way around.]
;B[kg];W[jp];B[iq];W[io];B[hp];W[ho];B[kq];W[lq];B[mq];W[nq]
;B[mr];W[kp];B[kr];W[lr];B[ks];W[js];B[qi];W[ls]C[**TW: This capturing move is wholly unnecessary.  The black group is dead - you don't need to actually take it. It's in no danger of escaping. Not only is spending a stone to capture it unnecessary, allowing your opponent a "free move," essentially, playing M1 actually takes a point AWAY from you. It's one less point of territory you own at the end.]
;B[mf];W[kr]C[**TW: Again, I think maybe you're thinking that is a weak point and you need to make eyes. Otherwise, I'm not sure why you chose to play there, adding to a group that is impossible to kill.  Also, again, you have actually taken a point AWAY from you.]
;B[lg];W[lb]C[**TW: Good. This move should've come many moves ago, but at least you are getting to it. It's a strong move.]
;B[hk];W[md];B[rk];W[mc];B[ne];W[ma]C[**TW: This capture is unnecessary.  L19 and M19 aren't going anywhere.]
;B[ej];W[lc]C[**TW: I'm stumped about this one.  Black made an attacking move on D10, a stone that has potential to help you get territory on the side. Why play M17, a stone inside a live group?]
;B[hg]C[**TW: Likewise, for black, this move is uneecessary.]
;W[dk]C[**TW: Good.  Black's wasted move at H13 allows this, but really, black should've pounced on D9 himself.]
;B[sl]C[**TW: A wasted move by black. Ask yourself, when you see an opponent's move, "Why did my opponent move there?" Black has no suitable answer for that question here.]
;W[dm]TR[dj][dk]C[**TW: Good! That stone is in an excellent spot, still connected to the triangle-marked stones and connecting them to your strong white group at the bottom. Excellent.]
;B[rf];W[bl]C[**TW: This is overkill, though. A black stone there could most likely easily be captured. Even if it couldn't, it doesn't endanger your stones. A move around Q18 to reduce black's corner, or K9 (see the variations) to reduce black's middle are more important.]
(;B[oc];W[nc];B[cn];W[dn];B[co];W[bn];B[bo];W[an];B[cm];W[cl]
;B[ao];W[bp];B[bm];W[am];B[al];W[an]C[**TW: Good. NOW is the time for that play, when the bent three is the ONLY possible eyespace for the group. Do you see the difference between playing in that space now versus other times, in other groups?]
;B[bn]
(;W[ap];B[ak];W[do];B[aj];W[am]C[**TW: This sequence seems like a success for white, but really, you should've wrapped up black's A8, 9, 10 stones as well.  See the variation]
;B[bi];W[el];B[gm];W[cj]C[**TW: I assume here you are threatening C11? However, C11 doesn't really do anything - it LOOKS like it might, but black can still connect at B12, for example.]
;B[ek];W[em];B[fl];W[bk];B[gk];W[hm];B[bj];W[ci];B[bh];W[ah]
;B[im];W[in];B[rh];W[gn];B[jl];W[lk];B[lj];W[kj];B[jk];W[ij]
;B[hl];W[gj];B[ei];W[pc];B[od]C[**TW: Here, black should've just dropped down to P18, cutting off your white stone - your white stone was too aggressive.

Black has a series of poor moves here that allow your white group to live.]
;W[rc];B[re]C[**TW: This move by black is wasted - there's no danger.]
;W[ob]
(;B[rg]C[**TW: Another wasted move by black.  Black R17 causes problems for you.  See variation.]
;W[qd];B[ri]C[**TW: Here, I'm not sure what black was scared of with the last 4 or 5 moves. Black has basically allowed you into the corner.]
;W[pg];B[qj];W[qb];B[fk];W[rd];B[pe];W[of];B[me];W[rb]C[**TW: What happens if you don't play this and black plays it instead? It's an easy capture for you and unnecessary.]
;B[lf];W[se];B[sf];W[sh]C[**TW: Again, here, I think you're "copying" this move from positions in which groups have a single line of eyespace along the edge. This move in this situation is attacking an indestructible group. Reducing eyespace only works if it sis a group's ONLY eyespace, like the excellent play in the black group that was around B6 earlier in the game.]
;B[aq]C[**TW: This doesn't need a response. Find black's 2 eyes. (There aren't - the black group is dead.)]

;W[na];B[tt]C[**TW: Black should not pass here.  Someone should take care of the white stone at A12. Either white plays A13 to save it, or black plays A13 to capture it. Likewise with T16.]

White wins by 48.5 points.

**TW: You asked at the beginning for things to study that will help your game. The biggest thing for you, I think, is understanding life and death.

When you look at a group, you should be able to identify if it is alive or dead. For example, black's group in the lower left that you thought was alive. Recognizing life and death serves two purposes:

1) If you can identify your own groups as living, you can then safely ignore them or use them to launch aggressive attacks. Launching attacks from groups that are not alive leads to trouble.

2) If you can identify your opponent's groups that are not yet living (i.e., have not yet formed two eyes), you can see what to attack. You can also reduce wasted attacks, like the white stones inside black's territory at game end. There is insufficient space for white to make two eyes, and black's group is indisputibly alive.

Another thought for your studying: realize that patterns on a go board, even if they take place in a very small region, are almost NEVER in isolation of the rest of the board - the most distant stone can still affect moves. I mention this because of the stones you dropped in places where, if the situation were different, you could reduce black's eyespace. I sense that you have seen these patterns played before and are copying them - however, as I pointed out during the comments, you aren't truly copying them. The moves you are thinking of, while they might appear to take place in a pattern identical to the ones in this game, actually take place in vastly different situations. It is not enough to simply memorize stone placements - the best thing is to understand WHY the stones are placed where they are. This reduces blind "stabbing" at what may, superficially, appear to be crucial points.

Overall, you won (obviously). You outplayed black. You had strong territory on the top and bottom and kept black's territory mostly to the middle (with some along the right side). You shouldn't be discouraged at all by your efforts here - there were wasted moves, and there were excellent moves.  Keep playing and thinking, and soon the number of excellent moves will eclipse the number of wasted moves.

If you have further questions or comments, feel free to either find me on IGS (although I'm not on very often and NOT playing in a game) or send me an email.

Thanks,
