AB[jd][dj]C[Hi, I'm kailcor, I will review your game.

 Before starting with it, I will like to give you an advise:
 Try to do not play many games with bots:

  The bots are good to play when u don't have no one else to play... but if u play with many bots u are going to learn to    play like one, and a good player do not play like one. The bots usually make mistakes in many parts, usually they make    a lot of movements that make no sense. So if you can start playing with more real players it will be pretty good. 
If you want to play with a real person look for me in kgs, I usually play there (Kailcor). Right now I have little time because the university but I can play a game from time to time.

Excuse me any mistakes that I do in english, not native. XD]
PL[W];W[fk];B[hk]LB[dg:A]C[This is not a bad move, but when you are a new player it's better to protect the corner or extend to the side. But this is a good move anyway, just is more complicated to defend.]
;W[fi]
(;B[fg]C[This is no the best move, when white move on D6 your stone in D4 was completly alone... you should extends your stone moving in D6 or D7]

;W[mh];B[dd];W[dc];B[ec];W[ci];B[ck]C[At this point your stone A is complety sorrounded by the enemy stones, has no sense to try to save it... you just can't save that stone]

LB[em:1][fm:2]TR[el][fl]SQ[gl][hl]C[This is a run for liberties... you can't win it because u can't give more liberties to your stones and also capture de square stones. So you should not play the triangule stones, the wall that you make with the 3 stones in h3 it's good to extende to the center... i want to point out at this moment of the game tha you just have one corner and you don't have any side... that means: You don't have territory]
;W[ch]
(;B[ke]C[If you want to protec de corner its better to play at m10 or m9]
;W[md];B[lc];W[hb]LB[he:A][bf:B]C[I think here would be better to play at A or B]

;B[de];W[gg];B[fh];W[bf]LB[cc:A][de:1][fg:2][ch:B][ij:3]C[Check it out this move, There's a common saying in Go: "your opponentâ€™s key point is your own"
So if you play first at b8 it would be a good move because u keep the group A and B separeted , and that make your opponent weaker. 
Also at this moment it's your turn and you have the group 1,2 almost surrounded and death.. so you need to connect you group with one alive group like 3 .]

(;B[eg]LB[ij:A]TR[gh]C[This is no a bad move, but is in the wrong moment, u need to conect that group with an alive group like A

;B[ej];W[fj];B[eh];W[ff];B[ef];W[hi]LB[jh:A]C[Here the bot is traying to separete you group at bot.. so you have to connect in A]
;B[je];W[jh];B[kg];W[mi];B[ig];W[mc];B[jf]C[This move has no anysense  you don't make your group stronger doing this, you become you group "heavy" Many stones in a little space, than end usually in death groups or weaker groups.]

;W[kc];B[jc];W[gc];B[ee];W[fa];B[lf];W[ld]C[At this point you don't have any group alive, all your groups can be captured. 

My recomendation is to play with real people and keep playing, you make good moves many times, (sorry if I just focus in the mistakes, is more important to know what is wrong and why).and you make basic mistakes. In go there's a saying: "Lose your first hundred games as quickly as possible". This is because if you play you learn how you opponent plays, you get expirence and at that point you improve your game skills faster.]
