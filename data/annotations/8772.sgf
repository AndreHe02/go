MR: Please find my comments in the game commentary, always starting with "MR". 

The game has very good and very improvable moves. 
One thing is that I have the feeling that you sometimes lose sight of your goals when continuing. I indicated that at some places in the commentary.
Another point is that I am not so sure about your algorithm of choosing joseki. Do you know the book "The great joseki debate"? If not, maybe it is a good idea to read, as you are given josekis to choose from in a specific board situation, and reasoning, why one is better than the other.
As you indicated that you are scared of Chinese openings, I would also recommend the book "The Chinese Opening".]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[the chinese opening scaring me
MR: No need to ... maybe just read the book "The Chinese Opening" :-)]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]C[MR: Normal so far ...];B[jp]
(;W[fq]C[i think this was slow maybe was be better something around c11
MR: H3 is more active because of the continuation M4.
But F3 is tight and still much better than G3 ...];B[de]
(;W[ch]C[maybe here the pincer is too abrupt?
MR: No, a pincer is fine, but you should think about which pincer to choose. I personally prefer the tight pincer at C13.]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[dd];B[ee];W[fb]C[MR: ? You are weakening your own stones at the top.]
;B[hc]C[MR: Invites the local continuation starting with G17 ... and should therefore be better at G17.]
(;W[ce]C[MR: Weakens C12.];B[cf];W[cd];B[cg]C[MR: Good shape move]
;W[ed];B[fd]C[this exchange i think was be good for me especially for the aji in f15 which i was tapped immediately]
;W[fe];B[eg];W[ge];B[hd];W[he];B[jc]
(;W[id]C[MR: My first impulse would be L17. 
You play rather heavy with your center group. Playing more lightly would be better, in my opinion. This coud also<already start with G13 instead of H15.]
;B[kc];W[ic];B[ib];W[gc];B[hb]
(;W[kd]C[MR: In Germany, there is a proverb "Who saysÂ has to say B", so should capture and connect. O17 still has the continuation of 3x invasion!]
;B[lc];W[me];B[ld];W[le];B[gd];W[oe];B[ig]C[i think here black was can be most severe
MR: You are right that this is not a very clever way for black to utilize your weaknesses. This way, he is just asking you to remove the aji.]
;W[jf]C[this was bad j14 looks better];B[gb];W[cb];B[pe]C[MR: Ok, now everything seems settled, so that you can make up new plans.]
;W[pb]C[MR: Not the main topic
One idea would be to induce the E12 to run away, e.g. with G13, D12, C11.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[nd];W[od]
(;B[ne]C[MR: Why not at Q17?];W[pc];B[of]C[i was think which the plane of black was be to cut my group with n16]
;W[md];B[oc];W[mc];B[mk];W[po]C[i dont now if this is a completely overplay or not, but i think was necessay something invasion,maybe q6 was better?
MR: This is a normal point for an invasion, and I agree that an invasion is necessary. Another option would be to attach at the Q3 stone to start some non standard variation.]
;B[qp]C[^MR: Good!];W[oq];B[pp];W[op];B[oo]
(;W[on]C[after the game i was think which o5 here can be better
MR: If you do not know which atari is better, this is a good indicator that another move (not atari) is better. 
If you play O5, this is saying "ok, the right edge will be black territory". This might be realistic here, but my personal feeling is that you do not have enough territory elsewhere to give the whole edge to black for free. 
Locally, R5 is a standard continuation. However, there will be difficult fighting with two weak white groups, so it might become difficult to handle.
If you find the fight too fierce, you should play more lightly instead of P3.]
;B[no];W[qo];B[ro];W[pr]C[MR: I am not sure about your goal here. P6 and Q2 do not feel to fit well together.]
;B[rq];W[lq];B[nq]C[MR: Looks like "too early"];W[nr];B[np]
;W[or];B[nn];W[lo]
(;B[ln]C[MR: If black is scared, he should simply remove the aji with P7. The following black moves in the game are aji keshi and only help white.]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[jo];B[hp];W[mi]C[hazardous i think
MR: I can understand that black does not want to allow white to close off the right edge even larger around N12.]

;B[ki];W[kj];B[ji];W[mj];B[jj];W[kl];B[jk];W[ml];B[nk];W[jl]
;B[jn];W[im]C[MR: Locally, J8 is the shape move to rescue the middle group. Black will play J5 anyway, as otherwise white will play there and both white groups are save.]
;B[in]
(;W[oi]C[MR: Off-topic. 
White should make eyespace for the group at the lower edge, e.g. K3.]

White should make eyespace with K2.];B[gq]C[i think j3 work
MR: Yes, should be at J3.];W[iq];B[hm];W[hl];B[gl];W[gm];B[hn]
;W[gk];B[fl];W[hk];B[qi]C[MR: Black should better care for his two groups in the center and on the left.]
(;W[ok]C[MR: Somehow, both players seem not to be interested to test the life of the center black group.]

;W[gi]C[here securely e11 is better for black];B[gg];W[fj];B[bh]
;W[ci];B[ei]C[MR: Moves like this are really aji keshi - only helps white to play where he anyway wants to play.]
;W[ej];B[gh];W[dh];B[dg];W[ff];B[eh]C[MR: Just for reference: Here you can see that E11 was bad.]
