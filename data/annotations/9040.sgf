AB[pp][dp][pd]C[Hello, Jaime here, I'll prepend my comments with J:

I've added a few short variants at moves showing a better (IMHO) idea.

As general ideas:

- you were ahead, clearly ahead, don't know what happened at the end of the game?

- you've wasted a few moves giving white sente (initiative). This is maybe the most serious error

- don't forget, from time to time at least, to relax and look at the whole board! Some local points are rather small and very big ones remain unplayed.

- and last, do not  try to save every stone! :-)

Good luck];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[dc];W[dd];B[ed];W[de];B[ee];W[dg]
;B[jd]C[i'm wondering if this move at k16 is the most effective at this point, or if i should keep fighting?

J: it is not too bad. I prefer it at n17, for instance, following the principle of not playing close to thickness, but not bad.]
;W[nc];B[nd];W[pc];B[oc]C[here i was trying to separate white groups and gain a center influence

J: good idea];W[ob];B[od];W[qc];B[qd];W[mc];B[md];W[kd];B[lc]
C[J: this move is dangerous, as your group can be cut... and you should not be able to kill white inside. But then W L16 is tricky, but I'd play B M16 instead]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[ld];B[le];W[ke];B[kf]C[J: this one is too much, too many cutting points, you can't stop white this way. Better turn your eyes into attacking R14 group.]
;W[me];B[ne];W[lf];B[ma];W[nb];B[kc]C[the shape for black with all the diagonals doesn't feel that secure, but i was trying to block up the upper middle

J: yes, but you've given away the R16 group.. I think O14 is better here]
;W[nf];B[rc];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[sd];W[qb]
(;B[sb];W[na]C[at this point i think i can kill the whole white group in the upper right hand corner...but i'm also noting that the rest of the board is totally unclaimed so not sure if this smaller victory is worth it (but a lot of stones & territory!)

J: a victory here is quite big. You can kill the W group (playing Q19) unless he kills you first, a complex battle but you're ahead]
;B[la]C[J: no! this is not needed at all, W can't make an eye at n19, this is a endgame point. If W plays Q19 then things will get interesting indeed]
;W[jf];B[kg]C[J: please, at this point, think if you really want to save that stone and why.Is it imoprtant to any plan? 

Else you're better playing either q19 or another big point (c17, k4..)]
;W[je];B[id];W[jg]
(;B[kh];W[lg];B[lh];W[mg];B[mh];W[nh];B[pa]C[J: well, finally!]
;W[pb];B[ra]C[J: not needed. Better S14, so your group is safe, and hence his is dead.

But this can be a matter of taste, S19 is very safe];W[jc]C[white doesn't seem to care that his upper right group is dead, am i missing something?

J: you're right, it is dead];B[jb];W[ic];B[hc];W[hd];B[ib];W[ie]
;B[he];W[gd];B[ge];W[gc];B[fd]C[J: a bit odd (apart from ugly shape) Why not just G18?]

C[J: this is veeeery small];W[cn]
(;B[cl];W[en]C[what is the proper response to this move?

J: g3 , f4, g4... k4 is too far away]
(;B[jp];W[fp];B[fq]C[this felt like a mistake, but i didn't want to lose the side

J: W helped, he could have entered the side, but i don't see f3 too bad]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[do]
(;B[dq]C[J: here C4 is way better];W[cp];B[cq];W[bp];B[bq];W[bn]
;B[ap]C[J: again, a endgame move... G4 is bigger, locally, or something to reinforce C8 (C11), or m prefered one, Q9]
;W[ao];B[aq];W[fn]C[white seems to have developed a strong shape that is blocking me out of the left side

J: yes but... how many points does W have? And you? If you stick to play calmly you cannot lose]
;B[jh];W[hf];B[ig];W[if];B[hg];W[gf];B[qa]C[J: I think you lost focus in the last moves. No real point in attacking H14, hard to kill (and no need), and speciallly no need to kill P18 now]

;W[fk];B[gk];W[dk];B[dl];W[ck];B[fj]C[J: F8, G9, F10, very weak shape... F10 at H10 would be much better, now plenty of cutting points!]
;W[di];B[pf]C[J: again, small... do you want to capture that lonely W stone?]

J: yes, absolutely :-) P6 was way bigger];W[ql];B[rl];W[pk]
;B[qm];W[pl];B[rm];W[sj]C[why did white make this move?

J: threatening to capture at S9];B[pn];W[on];B[rf];W[rg];B[ik]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[rn];W[qp];B[pn];W[oo];B[rp];W[qn]C[the fighting just continues with me making rushed moves because i feel like my time is running out]
;B[qq];W[pn];B[qp]C[J: no need for this move!

I won't comment further, but I'm curious to know what happened (did you resign??)]
