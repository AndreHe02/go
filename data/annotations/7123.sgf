C[To moria31:
Hi, my name is Long and thank you for letting me have the fun to review this game. In case you have any doubt regarding this game or question of any kind, please feel free to contact me.

Let's begin...];B[pc];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qj]C[Long: R10 is not so comon, usually played at R11 or Q11. Maybe you have some research in it?]

(;W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[cn];W[fp]
(;B[cp]C[Long: I cannot say I like this move at ths particular time. Attaching your opponent's stone closely usually makes him stronger, so it should be done when:
1. when your stones are weak and the opponent's are strong, helping your stones gain safety or a good shape.
2. when the combat afterward is favourable for you.

It is just the beginning of the game, and neither side in this corner is too strong or weak. B4 or C3 are good enough.

See variations...];W[cq]
(;B[do]C[Long: This move is not good. It makes white ultra-thick while black gains nothing. See variations...]

(;W[dq]
(;B[fo]C[Long: another questionable move. Attaching like this will only make white thicker, not to mention that white can easily turn the lower side into points.

Play B4 instead. That is important.]
(;W[jd]C[White is escaping from the battlefield!];B[cf];W[ch]
;B[ck];W[ce]
(;B[dg]LB[bf:A]C[Long: Not a good move. Playing like this white can always escape through A when he is in danger.

Play the simple D14 instead.];W[di]LB[bf:A]TR[cf][dg]SQ[ck]
[cn][do][fo][cp]C[Now let's check: White is save since he can always escape though B14, so only Black is under attack.

Also remember, the other side is not very thick either.];B[fg]
;W[gd]
(;B[ej]C[A very dangerous move here. First of all, Black may not be able to block white inside. And even if he can, he will create a lot of weakness somewhere for white to cut-and-beat, not to mention the worst-case emergency exit for white in B14.

In conclusion: Black will get his head seriously injuried.]
;W[ei];B[fj];W[fh];B[gh];W[gg]C[Now black is in a sea of troubles.]
;B[fi];W[eh];B[gf]
(;W[eg];B[hg];W[ef]C[Now White gets some territory, but black becomes thick in the centre. The game is unclear now, with white leading with points but black still has a chance.

And most importantly: Black has sente.]
(;B[qe]LB[pe:A]C[Long: I would like to play this stone at Q15, emphasising the potential in the centre.]
;W[mc];B[gp];W[gq];B[hp];W[hq];B[ip];W[iq]
(;B[jm]C[Compare this mojo with mine, which is bigger?];W[mo]
;B[nm];W[lm];B[jj];W[lk];B[nj]C[But white then played in the wrong direction, helping Black to gain points in both sides.]
;W[li];B[oh];W[pg]C[An aggressive move. The fight here will be decisive.]
;B[og];W[pf];B[ne];W[oe]
(;B[of]C[Not a good exchange here...];W[pe]
(;B[nd];W[qd]TR[pe][of]C[With the marked exchange R15 is now captured. We can see why the exchange is not good.]

I'd say that the results of the upper and lower left corners are favourable for white, and after black lost in the fighting of the upper right corner the game was over, though white can still do better in the centre.
