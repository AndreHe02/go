;B[pd]C[Hello!
In this game I play white and win by 3,5 points. I think, that opening was bad for me and I had really big problems with black upper-left moyo. So, I'll be grateful for any advice about my opening. Show me please, where I loose big or vital points in development. Where was better direction of play?
 Of course, any other comments are appreciated!
Thank You!
FR

P.S. Sorry for my bad english];W[qp]C[TH: Hello, I'm Tom Harrison (hotcoffee) and I'll do my best to review this game. Some of your questions are quite difficult for me to give absolute answers to, but I hope the suggestions I make are helpful.

TH: Final summary. There are 5 major points in the game that you should pay careful attention to:

You punished black for an early mistake in joseki which should have left you ahead, but need to remember the value of connecting your groups. 

You need to apply the following proverb to your game:
Do not play near thickness (eg. move 24 and 18)

You lost many points with the sequence beginning at move 24 - you should not have let black into your corner.

At move 20 you mis-read the direction of play - read the analysis at move 19 carefully.

When invading an opponent's moyo, play lightly and sacrifice stones if it helps you escape or live.

I hope this review has been helpful.
Good Luck!];B[cd];W[dq];B[do]
(;W[cm]LB[co:A][ed:B][ec:C]C[TH: I felt this move was slightly unusual. I do not think the move is bad, but it may be more normal at A, B or C. (see variations)]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dp];W[co]C[Black's next move is a mistake, which you punish.
See the variation for the correct move.]
(;B[bq];W[eq]C[FR: what do You think about E2? Is ti better to move around b10 or even tenuki?

TH: E2? I'm not sure what you mean, unless it is a mis-type for E3.

The move you just played is good. This is an immediate threat to kill Black's corner stones, and it firmly separates the D4 stones.
Black has failed.

Perhaps tenuki would be a good idea for black now - to try to fight back elsewhere.]

(;B[bp];W[bo];B[dr];W[er];B[cs]C[TH: Black lives with a tiny group, and white has sente.
You asked where you lost vital points or misread direction of play.

I think your *next* move was a mistake - I'm not sure, but it looks wrong to me.

Try to work out what move I'd play - black has three safe groups, white has one safe group and two groups that each are *almost* very strong.
Another thing to consider is that after joseki, each player is usually even - the player that gains in immediate territory usually gives influence to the other player... black made a mistake here, so what has white gained?]
;W[iq]LB[en:A]C[TH: What about A instead?

It took me a long time to think about this one.
- I will mention it many times throughout the game; not to be mean, but to point out how much more efficient a stone here would have been. It is just one mistake, but it will haunt you.

The two black stones are almost dead here. It's unlikely that black's next moves will use thier aji...
But at some point, a fight *could* break out in the centre, or on the left. It might be important to catch the two black stones so you can connect.

These comments continue in the variation.]
(;B[ic]LB[nc:D][qf:C][qj:B][op:A]C[FR: I always have problems playing against low chinese.  In the game I choose'd between shimari (A), extension (B) and kakari (C or D). Which of this moves better? Is there any other good points?

TH: A is perhaps a "big" move. It encloses a corner and scores some territory. Unfortunately it places no pressure on black at all - it even helps. There is a very similar (slightly smaller) move at E16, so A is not terribly urgent.

B is a calm extension. quite nice, but (despite not having a stone at E6, yet) perhaps it would be better at Q10, because the strength on the other side of the board could be used to co-ordinate some sort of framework... then again, J3 is a low stone too, so perhaps that strategy would not work.

I like C. It is the best move you have suggested, and I don't think there are better moves available. 
Why? Because it is a long extension from your ideal corner and is a good place for either player on the right hand side.

(Make sure you have read the variation regarding E6. In this position E6 is less important, as J3 does some of it's job.)]
;W[op]C[TH: So far every stone you have placed is below the centre line.
Black will punish you now by taking the biggest point on the board - one that you just made more valuable with your last move.]
;B[qj]C[TH: This is a good move. Black an white both wanted this point so it is worth double what it would be if only one player wanted it. Black now has the beginning of a two wing formation in the top right.]

(;W[ql]LB[ed:a]C[FR: Isn't it to slow?

TH: You've just fallen behind, and this move is big, but does nothing to make Black worry. It is too passive, and too slow.

This move has become important. You do not want black to finish his framework. See the variation.]
;B[mq]LB[mo:a][or:b]C[TH: Now... Black can extend in two directions, so this is a sensible invasion.

Black has no room to extend to the left.
The main points black is aiming at are A and B.

White's proper response is to take one of these options away. (See variations)]

(;W[kq];B[or];W[pq]LB[mo:a]C[TH: Small. Black can push further under, and can also still escape.
Better at A.];B[mo];W[jn]LB[nn:a][on:b]C[TH: wrong side. Better at A or B. You lose all the benefit out the R4 and P4 stones now.]
;B[on];W[po]C[TH: Perhaps you made this shape because you know a "ponnuki is strong and worth points".

This is not a ponnuki - ponnuki are made in the opening by capturing a stone. Because you capture a stone it takes only 3 moves to make. You made this in 4 moves, and it has no influence over the board.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[dj]
(;W[ck]C[FR: Was B9 or B10 better?

TH: I prefer B10. It has more spirit... but these stones are so weak, you may be best off capturing at E6.

C9 is such a short extension that it is hardly worth making.
You would not need to extend if you had a stone at E6.];B[cj]
;W[em]C[TH: Ouch. Seems like you lost a lot of moves (J3, C9) before making this one.]
;B[oj]LB[ed:a][nc:b][ob:c][qc:d][fj:e]C[FR: now it was really hard for me to decide, how to invade black's moyo.

TH: I think the best move is still E16. This corner is incomplete and you can split black's moyo slightly.

Other points to consider are B (which you played), C (which allows an extension either into the corner or along the side) and D - which takes some territory for sure but may be a little too good for black right now.

E is a key point that would be useful if the stone at P37 was white. 
You are too far behind on territory for E to be a sensible move for white right now.]

(;W[nc]LB[kc:a][pb:b][qc:c][ne:d]C[TH: White has many ways (ABCD) to run. A good invasion.]
;B[oc]C[FR: Is L17 instead of o16 playeble?

TH: Certainly. You are invading a strong moyo. You must play lightly and sacrifice stones whenever you can get an advantage by doing so. See variation.]

(;W[nd]C[TH: You become heavy, and allow black to take away your ideal extension.]
;B[lc];W[nf]C[TH: Good. Now you have no other choice but to run like this.]
;B[pf]C[TH: But black's corner is as good as sealed - you have lost the opportunity to invade R17. This is the disadvantage compared to L17 at move 40.]
;W[kc]C[TH: I'm not sure about this. How about getting some space with L15 instead?]
;B[kd];W[lb];B[kb];W[mb];B[jc]LB[mg:a]C[TH: you are not safe and need to run to the centre with A.]

(;W[oh]C[TH: The knight's move makes you weaker.

Run with the one step jump or diagonal move.

Almost never run with the knight's move. It is easily cut.]
;B[ph]TR[nf][oh]LB[kg:a][kf:b][lh:c]C[TH: Black let you off easily. You can still get to the centre.
Your marked stones may allow you to extend as far as A, B or C.

You can not make life at the top - there is not enough space.]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[na]C[TH: One eye.];B[ol]LB[mj:a]C[TH: Black takes the pressure off you.
Better for him to play at A, if he is worried about connecting his lower stones.]
;W[qe]C[TH: Overplay. You need to run still.];B[pe];W[qg];B[qf]
;W[pg];B[og];W[nh];B[of]TR[nf][nd][nh]C[TH: This move puts severe pressure on the marked stones.

C[FR: now white O17 look's in trouble. Any ideas about saving it?

TH: Black should not let you have more than one eye at the top. Therefore you have to run.]

(;W[la];B[mc];W[ng];B[me];W[ne];B[dc]LB[kh:a]C[TH: Black can probably kill with A.]

;B[fj]C[FR: yeh, now it's alive, but in cost of blacks moyo in the upper-left. Now game looks almost hopeless for me and only crazy invasion saved it. So, I'll be gratiful for any hints about earlyer moves, lead to such disaster]

(The problem with tewari analysis is can be misleading, but I think it works in this case.)

You played A.

At some point, there may be a fight (the left hand side white stones do not yet have a base) and black may make a threatening move using the aji of the two black stones. For the sake of the argument I'll say it is B - but many moves around the centre could be sente using this aji.

After B (assuming it is a sente threat) you will have to connect by capturing two stones in a net with C.

But there is a proverb: "If you are going to play A and expect B then play C, then why not just play C?"]

You can now expand up either the right hand side or the left (depending on black's move) and will dominate all fights over the territory at the base of the board.
