C[This is a game played in KGS, really a great server.

I think I have made some tactical mistake at the fuseki and middle-game.

I did not realized I was behind and lost by 8.5 points.

Feel free to point out my mistakes.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd]
;B[oq];W[qj];B[fq]LB[ql:A][jp:B]C[Is this move acceptable or better than A?

Should white play around B?

[chingu\]:
I would rather play at A. This is more active and takes the important extension in front of the shimari.]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[qm];B[fc];W[jd];B[cf];W[fd]C[[chingu\]:
Wrong direction. Attach to the other (stronger) stone. White wants to attack F17, so he should not touch it directly.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc];B[hc]LB[ib:A][ce:C][ci:B]C[What is the best move for white in this situation?

I have considered A too, but end up playing B.

[chingu\]:
Since black played solidly, I would do the same with a move at C. A is clearly an overplay. B looks a bit too thin.]
;W[ci];B[ed];W[de];B[ee];W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[ld]LB[md:A][qf:B]
[qh:C]C[Personally I think black A is better.

What is the best move for white to take advantage of black's thin-ness here?

Is white B better than O17 (the real play)?

[chingu\]:
As black i would have attacked the white group with C, building a big moyo (framework) in sente. B seems indeed to be a better move for white than the game.]
;W[nc];B[lb];W[pf]C[[chingu\]:
The low approach looks better, because the invasion at R17 will then end in better shape.]
;B[nd]LB[qd:A]C[I have made some reconsideration...

Is white A better?

[chingu\]:
Yes, the high approach move makes the invasion a bit ineffective.]

;W[sb];B[qh]C[Nice invasion by black here...];W[ph];B[qi]C[This move looks like a crude move to me, or it is not?

[chingu\]:
Looks crude, but somehow black has to take advantage of his thickness.]
;W[pi];B[qg];W[pg]LB[pj:A]C[[chingu\]:
This is an overplay. Black should immediately cut at A. White is in trouble then (see variation)]

(;B[rj]C[[chingu\]:
White is very lucky here.];W[qk];B[rk]LB[fo:A]C[I don't think S9 is necessary, black can tenuki here?

Black A look huge.

[chingu\]:
Tenuki is no problem.];W[qf];B[rf];W[re];B[rg];W[oj]C[Is this a slow move?

[chingu\]:
Seems to be necessary, though.];B[fi]LB[lg:B][fh:A]C[Should white play A to break up black here?

[chingu\]:
With all the black thickness around, A is too aggressive. Better just reduce around B.]
;W[kc];B[lc];W[jf]C[My bad moves i guess?

Too heavy to move out here, how will you handle this situation?

[chingu\]:
White creates trouble for himself. See earlier comment.];B[lf]

C[Somehow, I has to take care of bad aji at A...];B[ge]LB[fo:A]
C[[chingu\]:
Big mistake by black. A move like A is much better now.];W[ke]
;B[le];W[hq];B[fo]C[What is the best option for white here?

[chingu\]:
White can consider to settle the group as shown in the varation. The actual moves are good too.]

LB[oo:A]C[[chingu\]:
If white wants to resist this peep, he should do so at A. This prevents black from connecting.]

[dl:A]C[Is A better than E2?

[chingu\]:
No, E2 is bigger. If white plays A, black will first reduce the corner and then attach at B, which still works perfectly.]

No white has to connect anyway after the other hane, see variation.]
