C[Hi, My name is Jay and I'll be reviewing your game.  My cmments will start with "J:".]
;B[dd];W[pc];B[dq];W[pq];B[pj]TR[pe][po][ck]C[J: Q10 seems like a high reduction on the side, but in this phase of the game it may be too early.   If white plays a low move on the right side, black will find holes in his base.  An approach to a corner, or the Chinese opening seems more timely.]
;W[qn]C[Is R6 a good answer to black, or should I have been played more light ?

J: R6 is fine.];B[qe];W[nd]
(;B[pg]TR[ql]C[If black wants to secure territory, R12 is maybe better ?

J: notice that Q10 is in a weird position.  Black actually still owes one more move to secure territory here.  So Q10 is inefficient.

Since the right side is uninteresting for black, black can consider reducing white's corner with R17.  See variation.]
;W[kc]C[Is L17 to conservative ?

J: It feels like white can extend one line farther.];B[ck]
(;W[jp]MA[dq][ck][dd]C[Is K4 recommended with black low in D3 ?

J: K4 move is a bit one dimensional.  While it is true that the lower right is big, if black plays G4 now, black's left side feels enormous.

The three stones on the left make up the Chinese fuseki.  A common approach here is at G4.  See variation.]
;B[gq]C[H4 better move ?

J: G4 and G3 are both fine moves. H4 seems a bit too close to white. G4 aims at building a giant moyo, while G3 aims at securing a weaker moyo, but secure territory as well as a segue into white's bottom side.]
;W[cf]TR[dj][ek][dl][ep][df][dm][di]C[Is this the good way of approaching the big black shape on the left ? I think of F17 being more simple for white.

J: White needs to break up the left side.  C14 is ok.  You can also thik about the marked reductions.]
;B[ch];W[ef];B[fd];W[bd];B[cc];W[hc]C[J: white can also B17 here, since it helps C14 group, and that L17 is strong.]
;B[gc]C[woudn't have been G15 better ? This strenghtens the white.

J: yes, as i also attacks the b16 group.];W[gf];B[hd];W[ic]
;B[bc];W[ce]C[Is this big, or white should play J14 ?

J: D11 and F11 look interesting as a way to strengthen hite while reducing black's position.]
;B[mq]C[Is it the right moment to attack the white in the lower-right corner, or should the black pursuit the white in the upper-left?

J: White's upper left group is the weakest right now;  attack it will expand black's moyo.  N3 on the otherhand will hurt it.  K6 is a distant way to do this.]
;W[lq]C[Is it more wise to invite black to create territory while creating influence to the center (like with M4) ?

J: M3 is a bad way to attack; touching a stone will make it stronger.  The primary goal should be to creat thickness facing left while attack N3.  This will reduce black's moyo.]
;B[mo];W[lp]C[Should white jump up at K6 or press at O4 instead of reinforce the black ?

J: M4 is ok.];B[mp];W[kn]C[Is it better to press from the right ? (O6)

J:  This is the correct direction. L7 may be even more efficient.]
;B[pp]C[J: Black should simply jump out with N7 or a trickier jump at P7.  Q4->R4 exchange is aji keshi.  

If Q4 isn't played, black can R8 later and threaten to play R4 for a bif reduction.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[oq];W[pr]C[J:  White is happy and black is over concentrated now.]
;B[or]C[Is this right or should black push at P/Q7 or play R8?

J: Black should still jump out.  R8 is no longer an option, as the Q4 group will be under attack.]
;W[pn];B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[qk]TR[di][fi][cm][dl]C[Should have been better to continue at O7 ?

J: At this point, It would be prudent to look at either the C14 group for it is a weakest.  The marked points look interesting.]
;B[qj];W[rk];B[rj];W[do]C[Is it the right moment for the white to atack ? Is this a good spot ?

J: D5 doesn't feel like iike is too far from your other stone to work well.  Remember that white has two weak groups, he doesn't need three.]
;B[cn]C[J: C6 is an interesting way to play.];W[dn]C[I never thaught at black C6. Playing in the corner (C3) would be to risky. Even with life, black would grow strong to the center....

J: D6 is ok, as white can now get a good position in the center.  C5 is a fighting option.]
;B[co];W[dp];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[dm]C[I played this with E3 in mind. If black cut at E4, he would win the ladder.]
;B[cm];W[eq]
(;B[er]C[J: black should play E4 to connect underneath.  See Variation.]
;W[bq];B[br];W[dr];B[cr];W[fr];B[ds];W[fq]
(;B[go]C[J: Black should first focus his attention in attacking the C14 group.  Black can then make a reduction to the H4 area from the thickness he gets.  Running cannot be good for black.  See variation.]
;W[gm]C[Should white cut at G4, leading to

bH4
wF4
bH5
wH3
bJ3
wH2
bJ4
?

J: G7 is fine.];B[in];W[jm];B[hm];W[gn];B[jo]C[Wouldn't be black H6 more solid?

This give the opportunity to white to take whatever it preffers ?

J: black H6 would be an empty triangle.  K5 isn't really a threat to cut.  See variation.  This is a difficult escape for black.]
(;W[ko]C[The complexity of the calculations being to high for my level in the limited time, I preferred to keep it simple. Is this a good answer to K5?

J: K4 is not a threat.];B[hl]C[Wouldn't have been more solid black H6?

If wH8 than

bF4

wE4

bG8

and than in function of the white answer wF7 -> bJ8

or wF8 ->bG9 with possibility to make life after wJ8

J:  black has very little chance of making life in a space this small.]
;W[ho]TR[jo][in][hm][hl]C[Does the black have a good answer to that or the H8 was really bad ?

J: H8 only adds to the size of a weak group.  These four stones are not making territory, nor is it a big reduction to white's territory.]
;B[ip];W[io];B[hn];W[hp];B[jn];W[fo]C[I was to scared, I believe this stone is useless here as the black cannot cut at E4.

Should I have been capture at J3 instead ?

J: J3 will work, G4 reduces mor aji on the outside.];B[iq];W[jq]
C[psblue [5k\]: ups



I think this is a huge mistake.

J: :-(];B[gp]C[psblue [5k\]: sorry



I even excused myself for breaking the game...];W[fp];B[lr]
C[Is it necessary for black to play here? What could be the good moves for him ?

J: black J2 is a better attack on white.]
(;W[lm]C[J: White can still connect in ko with J2.   See variation.]
;B[kr]C[At this point, I wanted to resign. If black would have played G8, I would have been running with 3 groups (all white excepting the lower and the upper right)

The Go simulator give an estimate win for black, with about 20 points.

What are you thinking about, what is your estimate of the position ?

The black move gave me courrage to continue. What could be a good move for black, that could secure victory ?

J: My estimate is that white is down by around 25 points.  It is ok to resign at this point since white still has 3 weak groups.]
;W[nm]C[J: O7 is not a safe connection since black can still push at N7.]
;B[jr]C[Is this connection important for black ?

J: Black is decalring victory.];W[qd]C[Is it the right moment, or should white concentrate on the weak groups on the left ?]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[re];W[ng]C[Should white play on the left ?

J: white should protect bothe weak groups on the left with a move like F9/F10.]
;B[pd];W[qc];B[mc]C[J: Bad does not need to complicate a winning position.]
;W[md]C[Is there a move for black that could cut white or make life on the border ?]
;B[od];W[oc];B[if];W[ne]C[What would you normaly play as response to J14 ?

J: O15 is too small, black should ignore is and keep attacking the left.]
;B[of]C[Are those points big for black, or is better for him to put pressure on white in the upper left ?]
;W[ge];B[gd];W[id];B[he]C[is this necessary ?

J: Nothing is necessary for black anymore.  As long as all his stones live, he will win the game.]
;W[hf];B[ie];W[dh];B[bg]C[Isn't is good to cut in D13 instead ?

J: Black does not need to complicate things.];W[di];B[ci];W[dk]
;B[bf]C[Is this important, or black must cut in D10 / D8 ?

J: oh no, B14 is very bad blunder.];W[cl];B[bl];W[dl];B[bk]
;W[bo];B[bm];W[ap]C[J: because of that break-in, black is now only ahead by around 5 points.]
;B[le]C[Is this important?



What are the big moves for black at this moment ?

J: Black push through with N7.];W[nf];B[ld];W[lc];B[ej]C[J: this peep has no meaning.]
;W[dj];B[gj];W[fk];B[fj];W[gk];B[hk];W[cj];B[bj];W[ee]TR[sk]
[sj][ac][be]C[At this moment, I thought a cut in D13 is possible, and E15 would be in the same time secure and would allow E17 later on.

J: Good plan.  RIght now, T9/T10 and B15/A17 are large double sente moves for both players.]
;B[gl];W[fl];B[kl];W[km]C[From now on, the ending could look chaotic. From where must the black / white push in the center to secure the maximum of territory ?

J: it is very hard to get territory here.  Simply keeping you opponent from getting territory is enough.


The Go simulator gives a estimate victory for black with 10 points... Are you agree ?

J: I disagree, the game is pretty even now.];B[jl];W[ll]C[Moves like A2, G2, P1 or A17 demand immediate answer from black. Must white play those moves now ?

J: yes, since the end game has started.];B[lk];W[hi]C[Can a cut at H10 bring something good for white ?

J: Doesn't seems good for white to cut.];B[hj];W[gi]C[J: G11 should be at J11 to reduce the black middle.]
;B[ii];W[ih];B[ji];W[mk];B[fi];W[fh];B[hh];W[gh];B[ig];W[hg]
;B[jh];W[lj]C[J: That black sequence gave white 5 points.];B[kk]
;W[mj];B[pk];W[pl];B[lg]C[J: M13 is not big since white can reduce at L14.]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[sj]C[J: a Very large move.];B[si];W[sk]

At the end, white wins with 20 points.

From move 142, when I was behind, I gained 30 points to black whitout even realize.

I had no strategy to recuperate - being in byo yomi I just had the time to answer black moves, so black conducted the ending. What was the strategical error for black after move 142 that lead to a loose of 30 points ?

Thank you very much for your commentary.

J: Black made a lot of moves that turned out to be "dame" in the endgame.  

The key takeaway for black in this game should be to always attack the weak groups, not lose concentration when winning, and study some more endgame.

For white, I would think about how to make white's stone work together - not making weak groups. Also think of moves that serve multiple purposes;  for instance moves that attacks while taking territory, or reduces while making strength.

Thanks for showing me this game.])
