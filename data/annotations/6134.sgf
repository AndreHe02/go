C[hi

This is a game a played against someone who said who was 12k as me. Well, im very interested in what is the best way to make a good and "solid" moyo, i mean, ¿whats the secret for a good start? As in this game, i feel like i dont start as good as possible and then im always at backwards so i cant win ¿what mistakes do i make in the game?

Hope you can help me with this review.

thanks in advance

----------------------------------------------
Hi,

I am Jens-Uwe and currently around 5k on KGS (user 'jug'), so please take my comments in this review not as the absolute truth, but I will try and give what insights I can at my level.

All my comments begin with 'JUG'. When introducing go-concepts i mostly use japanese terms, but i've added a short description on first use; a more detailed explanation you may find on Sensei's Library http://senseis.xmp.net/, which is also a great free resource about all topics of Go.
I've used CGoban v3.3.19 to edit this SGF.

JUG: How to read the review:

Please follow the main-path and the referred variations there, because some basics and concepts are explained in those variations, that are needed to understand some follow-up-comments in the review. I refer to them as "see var before" (var starting from previous move) or "see next var" (var starting with the current node).
All existing comments except your intro have been removed.
Used abbreviations are: B=Black, W=White, notation 'X' refers to a letter-mark, wA1=W-move at A1, bT1=B-move at T1.

I've tried to point out what you asked. At the end of the game i finish with a summary and on what to concentrate to improve.

Enjoy the review!

Cheers,

[cf:D][jp:B]C[JUG: The black formation is called san-ren-sei aiming for a moyo-based strategy
As you see at the next move countering a moyo with a moyo has disadvantages. An alternative approach is shown in the var.

One of the questions for this review asked for a good start and secrets for it. I would like to answer to that with a simple list of questions referred to as basic three questions from "the LIST" (resembling http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shygost):

1. Am I ok? - Are my groups ok or can they be hassled?
2. Is the opponent ok? - Can groups be "hassled" (put on pressure to live or escape) or chased to get profit?
3. Are there undecided areas? - big areas that not yet became solid points for one of the players

One might say, this is silly, but if you manage to apply this questions for each and everyone of your moves, it has the positive effect, that you don't have weak groups. It will take some time to keep up the discipline to apply it on every move, but it's very helpful when you search for your next move.

The list does not spit out a move, but it answers the question what the next move should do, what it should aim at. Then you search for a move to fulfill that aim. This was for an introduction. Because there's more to it, the review contains examples about how to use the list.

This list takes the "desire" of the stones into consideration. What do the stones (your army ;) want on the board. That is about efficiency: bringing your stones on the board to work together.
You may ask what this "desire"-of-stones-thing is. Some desires in this position as examples:
- Ws desire is to make a 3-4 shimari (corner enclosure) facing the right with 'C' or 'D' for example
- The desire of such a shimari would be to make an extension along the top (with 'E' or 'F')
- Bs desire is to form a double-wing setting up a moyo with 'A' or 'B' for example. Those points could be considered miai (if W takes one, B can get the other and vice versa). But in fact, the point 'A' or 'E' is more desirable for B, because it is a point wanted by both players. It has two purposes: it serves as extension AND it denies a desirable extension for the opponent. The point 'B' would be also an extension for W, but around 'A' is better, as that serves better with Ws potential shimari at the top.]

(;W[dj]LB[dc:A][nc:D][gd:C][jd:B]C[JUG: W also plays for a moyo-based strategy. 'A' (wD17) is placed low (3-4). A moyo is better built with high stones (4th line) aiming for more influence, though the 3-4 is ok. W has to be aware that countering Bs moyo with another moyo, W can quickly fall behind as B had the first move (see next var).

A better move for B would be 'B' or 'C' as this attacks also Ws top left corner and helps in enlarging Bs moyo.]

(;B[de]LB[dc:G][fd:E][ce:F][cg:C][dg:B][ch:D][dj:A]C[JUG: a standard approach to a 3-4 stone.
It is common to approach a 3-4 stone, but playing this move in the first place as B is not following a moyo-strategy initiated with the san-ren-sei.

The first occasion to apply the three questions to search for Ws next move to Bs approach:

1. Is W ok?
At this time we only have single stones, which don't count as groups. Stones can be taken into consideration, but here it's not needed. -> so yes, W is ok.

2. Is opponent ok?
Bs right stones are ok. The issue at hand is Bs approach, which can be hassled if more pressure is put onto it. -> so no, opponent not ok and Bs approach is the next target.
=> put pressure on bD15 is the aim.

But how? An approach / invasion / reduction move wants to settle a group / make a living group / escape lightly while reducing. So the techniques to be used are: deny B a base or block Bs escape (taking away a running direction in a way making profit).

As we now have the aim, let's look out for a move to achieve that goal. For that you can ask more questions:

1. Are there any W stones, that can help in attacking?
2. Are there any W stones, that can be helped while attacking?
3. Are there any B stones, that can be attacked (or hurt) at the same time?
4. Is there a way to attack AND get territory?

for 1) yes, 'A' is in the vicinity. That stone can help. A move played from that side (e.g. 'BCD') is therefore an attack AND helps 'A' to settle AND could make the side more solid forming potential territory (three purposes).
for 2) not really, except 'A', that can be made more stable and resilient
for 3) no other B stones here
for 4) as (1)

A move like 'E' helps only one stone (wD17) and forms territory at the top, so only two purposes.
So a W pincer would be more desirable. How to choose between 'BCD' ?
- 'CD' brings the 'A'-stone down on the 3rd line AND takes Bs base away, 'C' also threatens to connect under with 'F'
- 'B' makes escaping a bit harder but allows B also more options to settle.
=> 'C' puts up more pressure AND allows connecting to wD17

Finally we have a move that fulfills three purposes. If you count up the potential connection to 'G' it makes up four.
So by applying the List, we logically reasoned a move. It's a powerful tool, once you get used to it.]

(;W[fd]LB[cg:B][dj:A]C[JUG: this is ok, but with Ws 'A'-stone in place, a pincer looks much better, putting more pressure on Bs approaching stone. For example with a move at 'B' (see var before).]
;B[cc]C[JUG: standard move initiating a joseki-sequence (joseki = known sequence that results in a fair result for both sides). A quick reference you can find at http://senseis.xmp.net/?Joseki. A more larger dictionary you can find in books or freely to download as Kogo's Dictionary at: http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm.
Those are nice references to look them up after your played your game and review it. Search for joseki that would have helped better.]

(;W[dd]LB[cb:A]C[JUG: this is not good, because it helps B to much to make a base for Bs group. This is a move, that B wants W to make, so B can play bC16.
A joseki variation would start with 'A' instead (see previous var)]
;B[cd]TR[dc][dd]C[JUG: Now Bs shape is good according to the proverb "play at the head of two stones" (the marked stones). So W forced B into making good shape. Normally we try not to help our opponent. As W was the one with the upper hand (more stones) in the area, this already is a success for B.]
;W[cg]LB[dd:A]C[JUG: this is too close and forces B to live, leaving a weak stone with Bs next move (as in the game).]
;B[cf]LB[fd:B][dg:A]C[JUG: good move for B, and as B has touched a weak stone, normally it's good to strengthen it with 'A' for example. But that leaves the 'B'-group alone while B is strong and alive in the corner. 'A' is also a good point for both (a shape move).]

(;W[qc]LB[hc:E][ic:F][fd:A][id:C][jd:B][cg:D][ch:G]C[JUG: Ws leaves back a weak stone (wC13) and the F16-group, that can be subject to an attack, so this is way too early. Also with bQ10 in place, this would make a good wall for B (see numbered joseki in next var).

In general this 3-3 invasion is not urgent as there are so much undecided areas open yet.
There's a proverb: "play urgent moves before big ones"
URGENT is to help your 'A'-group, while wR17 is only big. BUT it's not that big, if B attacks your 'A'-group making up profit on the other side. Never allow your opponent to hassle your groups making them weak. To make your groups then safe, your opponent can put pressure on it while making territory at the same time. In the end this can loose you more territory thatn you gained from an attack with a move like wR17.

To avoid that, use the List:

1. Am I ok?
- 'D' is not ok, but a single stone as are the other on D10 and D4 (this is a weakness as later also a B clamp at 'G' could bring a good result)
- 'A' is not ok: it doesn't live yet, it has two direction to flee, but B can block from the right forcing W to live small or run. Your group can be hassled.
=> so helping 'A' is the aim

More questions:
- Can other W stones be of help? no
- Can other W stones be helped? no
- Can W take territory while helping 'A'? yes (top side). That also denies B an extension here to build up a moyo for example with one of 'BCDE'.

That's one of the secrets. Don't create weak groups, so you have time to attack the opponent or get big points!]

(;B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[rc]LB[oc:A]TR[pd][qd]C[JUG: this is unusual by B and not good, it allows W to get the good point 'A'.]

(;W[oc]LB[rb:A]C[JUG: Very good
'A' first could be worth while (see var before).];B[qb]LB[lc:C]
[ld:A][od:B]C[JUG: this is insignificant. That's a yose (endgame) move. It's big, but ends gote (B loose the initiative).
W could even ignore this and take 'A' or 'B'.or 'C'. 'C' looks good, because that longs for Ws 'D'-group making a B invasion less likely.]
;W[pb];B[rb];W[lc]C[JUG: good];B[jc]LB[hc:A][lc:C]C[JUG: B is greedy, this is not good. 'A' would make a better point for B as that plays near the weaker group and not near the strong W group 'C'.]
;W[hc]C[JUG: now B helped W to settle and make his group healthy.]
;B[je]LB[jb:A]C[JUG: if needed, W can even connect under with 'A']
;W[nq]LB[jp:A]TR[dj][dm][dn][do][dp][ep][fp][gp]C[JUG: good, 'A' would have been an alternative forming a double-wing with the bottom left corner, but wO3 is more active.]
;B[kq]LB[qn:A][jp:D][lq:E][qq:C]C[JUG: this is an old joseki that is not played any longer by the professionals (for B simply one of 'ADE' would be an easy way).]

(;W[pq]LB[qn:A][qq:C]C[JUG: touching a weak stone (bQ4) is not good, this would also allow B to make a wall surrounding W in the corner and take points on the right side in exchange (see next var).

The valueable side for B is the right side, so W would like to spoil Bs plan to get the right side with a double pincer (double kakari) for example at 'A' or the natural 'C' (for examples see var before). 'C' makes easier variations, If unsure how to play double approaches.]

(;B[qq]C[JUG: good for B, there's no good continuation for W without giving B a good result.]
;W[pr]LB[ql:A]C[JUG: Bs valueable side is the right side, living small at the bottom would play into Bs hands. So this is too submissive, but it can't be helped now after wQ3, which was the initial problem-move in this situation. Check out some joseki in Kogo's Dictionary to get a feeling for some joseki, though don't memorize them, try to make up a healthy group while not helping the other too much.]
;B[qr]
(;W[lr]C[JUG: the aim should be "not getting surrounded", so get out (see var before).]
;B[oq];W[or];B[op];W[np]LB[mp:A]C[JUG: 'A' might work too, but this seems ok]
;B[lq];W[kr];B[mr]C[JUG: forced W to live, so bad reading by B]
;W[mq]C[JUG: forced];B[jr];W[ms]C[JUG: good, W is alive. So W can turn his interest somewhere else.]
;B[jp]LB[iq:B][jq:A]C[JUG: a solid connection with 'A' would have been better for B as W now has a peep at 'B' (wJ3).]

(;W[nn]LB[iq:A]C[JUG: the peep at 'A' first makes B heavy (see var before). A "heavy" group is not easily given up and most often has none or only one eye.

wO6 is helping B as it is no immediate threat to any of Bs group, it threatens to invade the right forcing B into protecting it.
As W was alive at the bottom, W could have invaded directly instead of this forcing move (see var before).]
;B[pn]
(;W[nl]LB[oc:C][cd:K][fd:B][qd:G][je:H][dj:E][bl:I][pn:F][dp:J]
[kq:A][nq:D]C[JUG: this is not doing much. The valueable territory is at the corners and side. The center is least valueable. If open everywhere the center can be reduced easily, so this move is not urgent.

Does B need to answer to this W move ?
Not at the right as this is stable enough for now (it's big, but nothing can get killed). Urgent for B is to help his 'A'-group, because it's weak. For a (stronger) player loosing sente (as it is the case here), is horrible. That's why stronger player rather sacrifice some stones than give up sente.

Use the question-list to check what to do:

1. is W ok ? for that count your groups (in mind): BCDE (let's 'E' consider a group this time)
- 'B'-group ok? yes, can connect to 'C'-group (wK18), escape into center or make two eyes
- 'C'-group ok? yes, can connect to 'C'-group or escape into center or make two eyes
- interesting would be how you feel about a B move at bK18 ... giving B options to launch an attack on both W groups, so W groups at top could get hassled, but not severly as also Bs group there isn't settled yet, so no big danger here.
- 'D'-group ok? yes, can make 2 eyes
- 'E'-group ok? yes, can get hassled a bit, but has room at side, and enough running directions to run

2. Is B ok ? mark B groups (in mind): AFGHK
- 'A'-group ok? no, no base yet (not alive), only 2 directions
- 'F'-group ok? yes, plenty of room to make eyes
- 'G'-group ok? yes, easy to make eyes
- 'H'-group ok? no, it's not alive, but it has 3 running directions.
- 'K'-group ok? yes, lives, no problem to make eyes
=> so 'A' and 'H' group would make good targets: 'A' is weaker as it has fewer running directions and is heavy making up a bigger target => aim is to attack 'A'-group

How to attack?
- Can other W stones help in the attack? yes, 'J'-stone can give support, 'D'-stones can put up pressure from the right
- Can other W stones be helped? yes, strengthen 'J'
- Can other B stones be hurt? no
- Can W make territory while attacking ? yes (bottom side, center). Proverb "first corner, then side, then center" -> so side first.

Which move to attack?
- Are there any weaknesses in the 'A'-group? yes, there's a peep at wJ3
=> see var before as example];B[fq]C[JUG: B happy to get this point

When i would be asked, I would consider wO8 one of the loosing moves. Giving up this sente, was missing a big chance (to attack Bs weak group and gain profit on the attack).]

(;W[cn]LB[iq:A]TR[cg][dj]C[JUG: makes a nice wave-pattern with marked stones) and therefore solidifies the left side, but an immediate peep could be considered (see var before)]
;B[dr]
(;W[cq]C[JUG: this is a very big move, but W can ignore bD2, if needed to tenuki or counter-attack (see var before).
It's most often good following the standard joseki sequences, but carefully think at every move, if taking sente elsewhere could not be better even if your opponent then gets a big move. It's an exchange then (furikawari).]
;B[cr]LB[gn:B][hp:A]C[JUG: this is a endgame-move and not good for B. 'A' or 'B' would have settled Bs group once and for all and Bs group would be out.]
;W[iq]C[JUG: good (though it might be a bit late, see next var). In general, a peep like this is not always good, as you may need to answer to moves like bJ4, but here it's ok, but it will start a heavy fight as there already are so many B stones around.]

(;B[jq]
(;W[hp]LB[gq:C][hr:A][ir:B]C[JUG: the idea of separating B into two groups shows good thinking, but B can simply connect with 'A' or start a fight with 'B' (see next vars).
W at 'C' could have worked better (see var before).]
(;B[fo];W[hn];B[fm];W[jn]LB[hl:C][io:B][hr:A]C[JUG: in principle this is a good shape if you are in open space, but B has way too many stones around here and so W can get cut, if not being careful. Check out a play of B at 'B' (see next var). So jumping out with 'C' is better till you have enough running directions to stay out of trouble.
Actually B missed that he can still connect with 'A' and Ws attack would have failed.]

(;B[mo];W[no];B[kn]
(;W[ln]LB[kn:A]C[JUG: this goes against the principle of separating stones: the 'A'-stone (bL6) separates wK6 and wM6, so is not a good shape.]

(;B[jm];W[km]LB[hn:D][io:C][no:E][jp:A][hr:B]C[JUG: the original aim is the 'A'-group, but B has 'B' to connect at any time or 'C' to swallow up W. So B has several miai points to get a healthy group. The one with a weak group here is Ws 'D'-group. So there's no good outcome for W.]
;B[in];W[ko]LB[hn:A][nn:B]C[JUG: This only captures a single stone and is also on the side of the strong (alive) 'B'-group, but put 'A'-group in danger.]
;B[jo]
(;W[kn]LB[im:B][hn:E][io:C][br:A][hr:D]C[JUG: this is protecting a single stone (one point) and is gote (giving up sente). Even taking 'A' now would be about making 7 points (though this is just an illustration, you wouldn't take that move now). It's an endgame move and also gote, but much bigger.

W propably played wL6 to cut at 'B' or 'C', but B can now simply connect with 'B' and then have a target 'E' to attack. W had a ponnuki, so if B catches it would be a ko. The other thought here is to save what can be saved (see var before) or to come back into the game.]
;B[ho]
(;W[im]LB[hp:A]C[JUG: giving up on 'A'];B[io]
(;W[kk]LB[je:D][hm:C][jm:B][hp:A]C[JUG: this is much too slow and gives up on 'A' and leaves a weakness at 'C' (double-atari). Sometimes capturing (here 'B') is better to remove the aji.

The idea now should be to attack Bs other weak group 'D' (see var before as example).
This move indirectly also attacks 'D', but is playing from the side of Ws strong group and makes up not much profit. Bs 'D'-group still has 3 running directions and B has sente now.

One idea of attacking is to drive your opponent into a strong position. W is not (very) strong in the center, but surely stronger than B is.]
;B[ld]C[JUG: wL9 is not pressuring enough giving B the chance to make a healthy group.]
;W[mc];B[nd]C[JUG: B misses the point, this is greedy]
(;W[kb]C[JUG: too easy on B];B[nc];W[nb];B[md];W[jb]C[JUG: W lives, but B has sente again and being pressed down to crawl on the 2nd line is not making many points]
;B[og]LB[bg:A][mj:C][nj:F][qj:E][cl:B][ql:D]C[JUG: Also B is frightened to loose too much territory. This is a very big move. B could have chosen 'F' to enlarge his moyo. Directly using thickness (with Bs wall on line 16) is not good (goes against proverb "don't play near thickness", which also applies for own stones/walls).

Overall it looks equal, though B looks more settled and seem to have more potential to make territory. Still, there are undecided areas that can be engaged with invasions or reductions: ABCF for Black, DE for White could be worth a try.]
;W[ki]LB[ma:3][fb:2][bc:1][mc:D][rc:N][cd:L][fd:C][nd:M][dg:H]
[qg:4][ci:11][hi:12][mi:13][dj:B][pj:O][cl:10][ql:5][im:J][km:F]
[bp:9][dp:A][np:E][fq:R][iq:K][jq:Q][qq:P][rq:6][br:G][hr:8]
[ns:7]TR[kk][nl][nn]C[JUG: this (wL11) is too slow as were the other three triangled-marked stones. What does this move threaten or aim at?
- it attacks no group.
- Does it make territory (in the center)? no as B has 4 directions (D15, K15, P13, F7) from where to reduce the center from the outside.
So building territory is not enough. When this is the case, destroying opponents territory is the alternative (or killing a group, if there is a weak one to target).

Let's apply the question-list instead of wL11:

1. Is W ok? mark the groups (often a help is to do it with a direction, e.g. clockwise instead of wild jumping): ABCDEFJK
- 'A': should be ok, enough room to make 2 eyes (for now), could get hassled a bit with a B invasion around area 10 attacking lower group AND top stones. B at 'G' (bB2) is a big move (about 7 points)
- 'B': still single stones, but the game is in a stage where every point starts to count. As wC13 is weak, B could target this, so could be ok
- 'C': ok (alive). 'D': ok (alive), 'E': ok (alive), 'F': consider it connected to 'E' (so alive) and ok
- 'J': single stones (no group)
- 'K': dead stones (no group)
=> 'B' could need a hand (taking the shape point wD13 'H' for example), but it would be a gote-move, sente for B again. So the left side is weak: a reinforcement would be good, but that's gote for W. So let's check the 2nd-question too

2. Is B ok? (marked groups clockwise): LMNOPQR
- 'L': ok (alive), 'M': ok (strong, no way to attack wall), 'N': ok (alive)
- 'O': ok (connected to top)
- 'P': ok (alive)
- 'Q': should be ok, W has too many cutting points (H7, G6)
- 'R': as 'K'-stones are dead, this group can be considered as one with 'Q'
=> so all B groups are ok

3. Are there undecided areas left? (marked all areas undecided and settled areas with numbers): 1-13
- identify settled areas for B: 1, 4, 6, 8
- identify settled areas for W: 2, 3, 7, 9
- that leaves undecided areas (areas that are not settled yet, areas where the owner is still unclear): 5,10,11,12,13. What's considered an undecided area or not comes with playing experience.

Now you need to analyze the characteristics of these areas:
- area 12 and 13 are in the center: territory in the center can only to be expected to be shared between the two players in this game at best (propably B can reduce it more than 50%) -> so uninteresting
- area 11 is smaller than area 10, a move to build it is gote in this case, and area 10 eventually still open for an invasion (diving deep into enemy territory trying to live or escape with a group) or reduction (a shallow reduction from outside the enemy territory)
- defending area 10 is big, but gote and area 11 still open for reduction
- area 5: wO8 can give a hand to support the invasion, going into this area is within the belly of the beast, so risky, if unsure if W can make a living group or escape, if invasion successful it would be a great deal of damage to B
=> so area 5 is the one to engage

[ar:I][gr:4][js:K][ks:H][os:G]C[JUG: wH15 is capturing one stone only and it ends gote. The game now is in yose (endgame-stage). You have to look out for big remaining sente-moves (as now the value of sente has decreased to a few points), each sente-move must make as many points as possible.

In general, it's good to make a count-estimation, who is in lead from time to time. This let you decide between two basic strategies:
- if you are ahead in points, you only have to bring the win home. That's about "how to win a won game". The other will try invasions, make things complex and you only have to answer calmly securing your lead. Don't get greedy. Read carefully and bring your win home.
- If you are behind in points, the roles are reversed. Then playing calmly will loose you the game. So in this case you have to make it up. At endgame stage it's harder to reduce a large lead of your opponent. Carefully read out the health status of each of your opponents groups: are they really alive?, can they be reduced in sente (or gote)?, etc.

Let's count here (analyzed without wH15 made); numbers mark areas of solid and potential territories:
- Bs: 1, 2, 3, 4, around 5
- Ws: 6, 7, 8, some around 9

Counting the areas (at open borders assume equally shared borders by simply descending to the edge):
- '1': 24p
- '2': 28p
- '3': 3p (assuming it's alive and without the 'M'-stones)
- '4': 22p (including wG6-stones and bH9-stones connected)
- '5': 1-2p maybe
- '6': 18p
- '7': 18p (assuming B can connect to bN5)
- '8': 10p
- '9': difficult to estimate as it's so open, so assuming it's shared between the players: 6-8p for W at best

That makes:
- for B: 24+28+3+22+2 + 1 prisoner = 80p
- for W: 18+18+10+8 + 5 prisoners + 6.5 komi = 67.5p
=> So W is behind by about 12 points at the moment

In fact W can't win this game any more, not only of the 12p difference but also because B has more absolute sente-moves than W has (sente-moves that W must answer). That means, W has more weaknesses left than B has. There is too many aji left, that B can use to threaten the life of Ws groups:
- B at bA8 is sente, as bA7 would kill W if unanswered
- B at bG8 is sente, because of the aji of bK7, W must answer with wK8. bG8 allows to connect to bH9 and prevents wG8, threatening to cut off bH9-stones. So it's a big reverse sente for B (reverse sente = a move that prevents a W sente move).
- B at bQ19 is sente
- B at bL1 can be considered sente (not life threatening, but big)
- B at bT8 is not sente, but makes bR3-group unconditionally alive and is very big. B has "capturing wT7" and "capturing wR4" miai for making life, only if W gets both (wQ4 and connect wT7) S5 would be a false eye, leaving the B corner killable. However that would need 3 moves in a row, so B can be considered alive. The miai-concept is nothing more than having a "plan B" (another option) if you are trapped.
- In constrast W doesn't have such strong sente-moves. So whatever move W takes, B can overrule it with playing one of the life-threatening sente-moves and get all the big points, while W has to answer to them.

For endgame you have to check all the borders of territories for moves that get profit and their characteristics: is a move sente, does it prevent a sente move (reverse sente), is it gote, will it end in sente. Beside of that, you have to read ahead how many points can be gained for those moves and also how many points your opponent would gain if played first at a specific area. Then you compare the two local end-positions. The difference in points is the value of having the first move in that particular area.

After that analysis you have a list of areas and moves, their characteristics and value. Then you can order that list by characteristic (double sente, sente / reverse sente, gote) and value and know in which order you have to play your moves. In such analysises it's important that you also search for the best move of your opponent and not moves you want him to make. In fact it's good if you always apply that attitude in your reading. Hoping for mistakes of your opponent does you no good for becoming better. When you know a move does not work, don't use it, but search for moves that do work.

Let's check, what W can do: letters mark areas (not moves) that need consideration for endgame-moves: ABCDEGHIJLO.
- 'A': B has bT8, bT9 or bT10 as possible moves. bT8 captures 2 stones, makes 'N'-group alive, but may end gote, if W answers at wT9 -> bS8, then wT10 is a big sente (see next var on bT8/bT9 as example for Bs best shot here).
What is best for W here? Play at bA1 for vars. Comparing best W first at wT9 or wT10 with bT9 this gives a values of 2 points. if W starts, W end up sente (or good follow-up), if B starts, B ends sente (as outlined, W may take sente, but Bs follow-up is big too, so let's assume this as ending for sente for B too). That makes a move here double-sente (sente for both players). -> W sente, B sente, 2 points

- 'B': bQ19 is sente as is the follow-up of bP19 also ending in sente. wR19 or wQ19 is suicide (see vars before). wP19 would be the move, but is gote. As outlined in the vars before, a W move here does not gain anything, so it's Bs right to engage here -> W gote, B sente, 3 points
- 'C': bF19, wG19, bD19 (W sente) compared to wF19, bD19 (W sente) shows a value-difference of 2 points -> W sente, B gote, value 2 points
- 'D': bE15, wF15 or better tenuki (W sente) compared to wE15, bD14 (W sente) -> W sente, B gote, 2 points
- 'E': bG8 (atari), wK8 (B sente) compared to wG8, B can answer with bG9 or bG7 (play bB1 now to check vars) -> W sente, B sente, value 1p
- 'G': bP1, wO1, bR1 (W sente) compared to wP1, bR1 (W sente, but B could tenuki instead as this can be a ko) -> W sente, B gote, 2p
- 'H': bL1, wO2 (B sente) compared to wK1, bJ1, wL1 does not work because of N2-aji, so W only have wL1, bK1 (atari), wO2 (B sente) -> W gote, B sente, 1p
- 'I': bA2 (W sente) compared to wA2 (later bB1) -> W end in gote, B end in gote, 2p
- 'J': bP15 (W sente) compared to wP15, bQ15 (W sente) -> W sente, B gote, 1p
- 'L': bA8, wA7 (B sente) compared to wA8, bA9, wA7 (B sente) -> W gote, B sente, 1p
- 'O': bE3 (W sente) compared to wE3, bD3, wE4, bE2 (W sente) -> W sente, B gote, 1p

Brought into order: double-sente first (moves ending sente for both, those are valueable for both), then sente and reverse-sente (ending gote for W, but sente for B), then gote makes the following list:
- double sente: E (1p), A (2p)
- sente + reverse-sente: O (1p), D (2p), J (1p), B (3p), C (2p), G (2p)
- gote: I (2p), H (1p), L (1p)

Why 'E' first? 'A' first may be possible too, but 'E' might be a stronger sente than 'A'.
Why 'H' not reverse-sente? Could also follow move 'O', but 'I'-move is bigger and because a play at 'H' is Bs right.
Why 'O' before the others? 'O' is a stronger sente and will not be ignored.

As this moves are played, also B does this analysis. With each move the characteristics and value can change for areas, but you don't need to do this whole analysis on all moves again. Only on those where a move have been played to recalculate a good order of moves to do.

You may say, that reading this out all in your head while playing seems a big job and you are right about that. But with time you will get better at it. That's also the reason why computers play so good in late endgame. It's pure calculation.

C[JUG: summary:

The game was in favour for B as W made it too easy on B in the opening, for example in the top left corner or with wO6 at move #46 helping B to build the right side while getting as good as nothing as compensation; or also at move #100 (too submissive and small).
Some typical standard joseki might come in handy (top left and bottom right corner was too good for B).
W missed some chances to attack Bs weak groups.
The biggest strategical mistakes surely was loosing sente too often (at important stages) and missing some important cuts.
At move #182 it was clear, the game was over (B too much ahead). Giving up sente 3 times certainly had something to do with that. In the end, there was an interesting ko-fight (move #202 and #209). Even if the game was lost, W stopped playing the ko at move #218.


Advice:
- Focus on not-loosing sente, read ahead a few moves, if a move end in sente or gote. In the game, W has lost important sente at moves #46, #72, #82 and #183. As you saw, the value of having sente can be enormous being able to lead the way and get the big points playing an active game.
Also carefully check, if a move really must be answered or if you have a stronger sente-move, that your opponent must answer himself or if going out to inflict mutual damage would be acceptable.

- Good reading skills are important, not only to kill groups or make them alive, but also to check if oneself is alive or other can be cut successfully. Apparent this was at moves #89, #97, #127, #134 and in the endgame-stage and in the overlooking of some important cuts. In the reading category also falls the value of aji (the B stone at K7 for example). Try to develop an awareness of your and the others weaknesses ready to explore it. As long as a stone is on the board it might has some surprising effect.
Improve your reading by solving life & death problems (also with some emphasis on cutting and connecting): good books are "Graded Go Problems for Beginners, Vol. 1-3" by Kano Yoshinori(9p), http://goproblems.com/, or the go problems at http://gobase.org/studying/problems/academy/ (you'll need an account for the latter).

- Try applying the question-list at least at some of the moves in your games. Best if you apply it on each and every move (you then never have weak groups and don't overlook, when the opponent will get too big areas). Furthermore that's the tool to find multi-purpose moves. It's hard at the beginning but with time you do it automatically.
To decide what's an undecided area or not, comes with experience: play 100-200 games concentrating on invasions, then you get a feeling what works and what does not, getting to know what is an undecided area and what isn't.

- As a general advice i recommend that you review all of your games (at least those that you lost): try to find better moves, where you messed up, alternatives play (also looking out for the best answers of your opponent). Look up other joseki or joseki where you screwed up in some joseki dictionary.
If you see that a move does not work, it makes you a better player not even to try it and hoping for an opponents mistake. And if you don't understand what was going on in one of your games, get some help from stronger players (get us GTL-reviewers something to do ;-)

- Finally, to get experience with go-concepts you should play games not to win or loose, but to learn something. Stay emotionally detached and try out invasions or other things to get a feeling for it and get more experience with it, then make a review afterwards. Don't play too fast and think about every move, even it looks obvious. There may be even better moves. If you don't see how to win, accept it and resign as the goal was not winning or loosing but learning how to use certain concepts. Review it and start a new one to learn more. Then for some games, play seriously with the will to win using what you've learned.

Hope that review was of some help.

Have fun with this wonderful game!

This is a crucial time for B. bT10 is a 7p reverse-sente-move.

An interesting facette is the concept of mutual damage. bT10 is big, but B may choose to tenuki taking sente. Check out at 'A' to threaten some stones ..., which isn't the wisest for B.

B could also play some absolute sente-moves, which W would not ignore, like bA8 threatening the life of Ws group. So there are moves ('A') that may be ignored for mutual damage and forcing moves that like 'B', that would not be ignored. In this case B at 'B' would be a waste, because it would only win one point more. Often it's better to keep such moves as ko-threats (in case you need some). Only when there are no moves left with a value higher than 1p, then moves like 'B' should be taken.

So B at 'A' is sente, but not absolute sente as would be a move at 'B'. So you have to carefully read, if it's worth while to ignore a move or not.]

;AE[gc][hc][ic][hd][id][ld][he];W[ic];B[qc]LB[fq:A]C[JUG: B would not play this right now, because "loosing sente" is bigger than taking this corner at this stage of the game.

The value of "having sente" is about 13 points in the early stage of the game as there are so many open areas that can be engaged. That's why W normally gets 6.5 points komi - half the value of the first move - as B starts. As more stones are played and the board fills up, one can't get 13 points any more, so the value of sente decreases till the endgame where the value of sente shrinked to about 2-6 points, and at the very end to 1 point.

Playing bR17 is big, but loosing sente is worse as there are bigger moves like 'A' for example.
Same goes for W. Having sente (the initiative) to lead the way is an active way to play, because the one who leads often gets more points. If you only answer to your opponents move, you will loose. A metaphor for that is "the blind man walking (by the hand)".

You might say, that if W now invades at wR3, W will end sente, so getting the points and keep sente. But joseki-sequences can be interrupted at some points, at which B may take sente.]

(;B[gd];W[de];B[jj]C[JUG: Bs moyo is bigger. One of your questions is how to make a moyo "solid". It's a dream of every player to make a moyo into solid territory. But that's not how it works. It's shown from Bs view now, but the principle is the same for W.

The purpose of a moyo is to give the opponent a hard time in reducing the moyo. One player makes a big moyo, so the other cannot stand it any longer and invades the moyo to reduce its size. As B has the first move, W will propably end up with smaller territory as B, if it's moyo against moyo. So W has to reduce the moyo from inside.
As the invader is surrounded by the moyo-stones, it's harder to make a healthy group. If W invades, by attacking the intruder more "solid" territory is made (attacking one side gives territory on the other side of the made moves).
Follow the var for an example invasion and illustration how to use a moyo to make solid territory.]

(;W[nc]LB[dc:B][ce:C][nq:A]C[JUG: a calm example.
Approaching at 'A' is not equivalent here, because this approach at wO17 works better with the W 'B'-stone (wD17). A 3-4 stone wants to make a shimari with 'C' next and so is facing the top side towards the right. Giving that side to B would be missing a chance. That makes wO17 favourable in regard to 'A'.]
;B[pf]LB[jd:A]C[JUG: making it easy on W ...
too easy actually, allowing W a perfect extension. A better move for B would be to pinch at 'A' for example. It's called "pinch" as for a "pincer", K16 is too far away.]
