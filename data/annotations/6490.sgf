C[Jeff:  Although I won, I felt like I wasn't playing very well.  I felt behind most of the game, until white lost the fight in the bottom left corner.  I only felt like there was a clear best move for a few of my plays.  For the rest, I was very uncertain.

Any advice would be helpful, for both players.





Hello, I'm Darrell.

The main points I saw during the game were these:

1.  Corners, then sides, then center.  (Black made several center oriented moyo-type 
      moves where there shouldn't have been a way to make a moyo.
2.  Don't let your opponent drive a spike through your stones.
3.  Don't wander off in the middle of a fight.
4.  Less easy to explain, but fairly simple reading errors led to some ugly shapes.

Keep an eye out for these concepts as you look at the review.  I hope you find it helpful!

Good luck and have fun with your go.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[nc]

(;B[oe]C[This is ok.  I think the attachment is probably slightly superior and this move is more used to avoid complications -  like when you're playing handicap as black and are afraid of white's fighting ability.]

(;W[pb]LB[qc:A]C[This white move seems funny.  I think it belongs at A.]

(;B[qc]LB[ob:A]C[This is bad shape.  I agree with your comment that S16 looks better.]
;W[rd]TR[pb][qc][pd]C[Notice how white took both of the points where black could make the "tiger's mouth" shape?  This is why this is bad shape for black.]

(;B[gq]C[I don't like this move at all.  White has two weakish groups on the top right and you could profit by harassing them.]

C[This move is very strange.  If the marked stone were black, you could try it as a cosmic style huge moyo play.  But on this board there is no moyo possibilty there, and you should use the normal priorities of corner first, then side, then center.  Any of these moves seem normal and good.]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[db];B[jd]C[good.  Splits white.]
(;W[ne]CR[qc][pd][oe]C[From here onward, I had no idea what to do with these stones.



Yes, they are awkward, but still valuable since they are separating two unsettled white groups.]
;B[nf];W[me];B[pg]LB[of:A][pf:B][fo:C]C[J: Expecting white to take either A or B, planning on playing a ladder breaker at X.



Interesting move!  Feels like it leaves aji, but it also accomplishes putting real pressure on white.]

(;W[pf]C[this is a bad move.  It does nothing for white at all, and fixes black's cutting point.]
;B[of]
(;W[og]C[My first reaction is that this is overplay for white.  White is not strong enough to cut and fight.]

(;B[fo]C[Guo Juan, 5 dan professional, calls this move a "coffee break."  Right in the middle of a fight, you play somewhere else on the board (taking a coffee break).

This move ignores the urgent fight (yes, I know it's a ladder breaker)  Black plays a center move when there are no moyos.  The lower left corner won't die if white ignores this move.  This move isn't really sente, so white should just ignore it and win the fight in the top right.]

(;W[co]LB[ph:C][cn:B][dn:A]C[J: There must be a better move.  Maybe A or B.

Yes, this is close to a pass move.  White should capture at C.  All of black's center oriented stones lose all their meaning instantly.]

(;B[df]C[You can't let white drive a spike between your stones this way.  You MUST block.  Letting your opponent "spike" your stones like this is almost ALWAYS bad.]

;W[md]C[Good.  This is correct.];B[mc]
(;W[od]C[No, this is where white crashes.  See variation.  White should have been fine here, but this move makes all the problems.]

[dg:B][qi:C]C[J: Trying to close white in, strengthening both black groups and building outside influence

Good thinking.  The black group on top could come under attack without makeing a move around here.  

The value of the influence is diminished because of A, but it's still valuable.  Letting white drive through at A was very bad.  Moves B and C are still HUGE.  See the variation here to see how a white move at B destroys all of black's influence and also makes black's 4th line profit dissapear into a tiny group.]
