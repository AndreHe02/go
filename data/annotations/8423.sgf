You were right about R9/Q9; they would have be too close to black who would have played R10, strengthening his lone stone and weakening your attacking stone. O3 had the right idea behind it but is overplay. P4 would have been better; see two possible variations - nothing really works for black after P4.]

Good thinking. You could even go to O16 or O17. A rule of thumb is to extend back as many places as his approach.]

The proverb says "Don't throw good stones after bad"; sometimes it is just hard to let go, I know. You are trying to connect the two groups but they are to far apart with to many black stones in the vicinity. You can save the two side stones and secure the side/corner with D14; the variation shows this.]

We ended up not counting two points for black as I see now. Maybe we were both really tired at this stage anyway. My questions are: What could I have done differently in the center? How do I get better at defending? Is there anything I could have done differently in the endgame?

Thanks so much in advance for the review!

To answer your questions:

I think your centre play was good. There was some fighting to be done and you handled it well. However, I think you became concerned about the centre too early. There was a very large point at K16 for a long time that would have created a large moyo between your two top corners. Unfortunately, in the end, black got there first, but your response to his play there was good. You kept him hemmed in and were close to killing him. To improve this, you should do more life and death problems (either in books or from somewhere like www.goproblems.com).

The way to get better at defending, like everything in go and most things in life, is to practise. You have the same problem I had which is to create too many cutting points when you defend. It looks like you are blocking but, in reality, you leave yourself susceptible to cuts and end up losing much more than if you were conservative with your blocking. The group around P8 is a good example. Also, remember to protect sides and corners; you lost half a dozen points in the top right by playing R15 instead of S16.

Your endgame is okay. You make some unnecessary moves such as N2 which is like giving a free move to your opponent. In the endgame, moves are only worth a few points so it may not seem like it matters which move you make or when you make it but oftem games are won and lost by half a point. Try to keep sente unless there is something more valuable to be had in a gote move. Also, each extra stone (N2, G17) you place in your own territory is one less point for you.]
