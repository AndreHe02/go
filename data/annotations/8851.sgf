C[P: Hello! My name is Peter (petition 2k on KGS), and I received this game to review throughh the go teaching ladder. In this review, I'll precede all my comments with P:. I use W for white and B for black. I don't use too many non-english terms, but if you see any go terms you aren't familiar with and that I don't explain, check out sensei's library at senseis.xmp.net. It seems like you enjoy studying go though, so you probably already have ^^

In this review, I focus mostly on how to have faster, more active play that favours big points over small ones. I also offer some critiques of how tengen was used.]
;B[jj]C[JS: This is my second game with the Tengen and I do not think I used it quite right in this game.

P: Whoah tengen. I think most go players have a new fuseki/ opening-on-tengen phase. Personally, I don't think it is a very good opening move. It becomes useful in openings only if you intend to play complicated fighting josekis like the taisha, where breaking all ladders from every corner could come in handy. Even in the 1970s in Japan during the New Fuseki movement, opening on tengen only had about a 1/3 winning ratio. Some argue this is because less study has been put into tengen openings, but to my eyes, if pros can't make it work over a decade, then playing it in kyu games is sort of just hoping our opponents get flustered and overplay.

Tengen doesn't exert influence over any potential territory. W receives komi because B gets to play first, so B's first move must be worth at least 7 points in order to not immediately fall behind. Opening on tengen is a move that prepares for fighting, but because it doesn't claim any territory, it is also demands fighting, because by playing it, B is immediately 6.5 points behind. 

As W, the main strategy against B's opening on Tengen is to play solidly, make territory, and pressure B with that 6.5 point lead.]
;W[pp];B[dp];W[jq]C[P: A poor move by W, allowing B to get the choice of corners.]
;B[pd];W[dd]C[P: A tengen first move in a diagonal opening! What fun. Now, my sense of diagonal openings is that they usually lead to more territory-oriented games, because they tend to lack the large moyos that characterize side fusekis. So in this Bq17 is inconsistent with tengen, because it does not aim towards the creation of a moyo. 

If w's strategy against tengen is to play conservatively and make territory, then B's strategy must be to force W to give something for him or her to attack. Creating a huge moyo forces an invasion, leading to weak groups that run towards the centre, activating the power of a tengen stone.]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fc]C[P: W plays for territory, but helps B make a moyo on the left. The question for B now is how to solidify it...]
;B[dj]LB[cj:A]C[JS:Do you think I should have played at A instead?

P: Yes, A would have been a better move. Bd10 is not joseki -- either c10 or d11 are the usual moves. This situation demands the third-line play in the name of balance -- B's position is very high, giving powerful influence, and this would be complimented by a lower stone to anchor the left side and complicate a W invasion. Which is basically what you say on the next comment...]
;W[cm]
(;B[co]C[JS: It would have made whites position here more dangerous I think.

P: Yes, w's position would be tricky after c5. W might even have thought twice about the direction of the approach and come in at f4 instead. I do think this would have been the better move for w anyway, to avoid a running fight.

In this position, the bd10 acts as a high pincer. High pincers are used to force W into a low position. A typical high pincer joseki leaves few good moves on the side in which it is played, because w is pushed low, and therefore other moves are small, while b is undercut, making it hard to create territory. Therefore, the sequence after wb10 makes the b stones on line 14 seem out of place. 

For these reasions, I think bc5 is the wrong direction. See variation for another way to play]
;W[bj]
(;B[ck]C[P: B should never play a sequence like this -- all it does is help w to connect and make bad shape. Variation shows a different strategy]
;W[bk];B[cl];W[bl]C[P: Hideo Otaki, 9p, discusses this kind of position in his book Opening Theory Made Easy and says that B has basically just helped W play hane at the head of his/her two stones. B can't avoid being left with cutting points, and w's position is not hurt at all, in fact it is strengthened. 

This is an example of heavy play. see that variation on the previous commented move for a lighter way of playing as black.]
;B[dm];W[cn];B[dn];W[bo];B[bp];W[an]
(;B[ip]TR[jq]LB[lq:A][pn:B][qn:C]C[JS: I think this move was bad because I am trying to make a moyo. From what I have read the tengen is more for attacking so I was wondering if A might have been a better move. I could then have pressured the marked stone and after making a wall between A and the tengen I could have approached his lone 4-4 stone at B or C and finally try to make some territory in the upper right quarter of the board. Is this a good strategy?

P: This is a challenging position... W's marked stone is perfectly position to neutralize B's wall. How to find the best move? 

Your move at J4 seemed to be trying to strike a balance between attack and defense, but it ended up helping w to solidify their position inside of your moyo.  (If you want to attack a stone, do not play in contact with it! (A shoulder hit counts as contact)) B ends in gote with little corner territory.

I've attached four variations on this move exploring moves around the points A and C you mentionned and also h3, that hopefully will shed light on the correct direction of play here.]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[hq];B[gp];W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[eq];W[er];B[dr]
;W[fq];B[fp];W[mq]C[P: b still has a weakness in the corner at c3...]
(;B[ko]C[P: This move is very, very slow. B is trying to seal in twenty points of territory in the middle of the board with a move that does not threaten w's position. Pushing one more time at k4 is possible if you want, but it is urgent to get an approach move around or extend to r10.

See variation.];W[mo]C[P: W at once reinforces the n3 stone and begins to build a moyo on the right]
;B[lm]TR[ck][cl][co][dj][dm][dn][dp][eq][fp][gp][gq][hp][ip]
[jj][ko]C[P: This move is even slower than l5. Look at the ammount of territory there in the centre, it is about twenty points.

The sixteen marked stones together have created a potential territory of about twenty points. This is not very efficient -- each move is only worth about 1 point. Compare that to w's stone's on the bottom if w plays r4 next turn -- ten stones securing 30 points of solid territory.

This is especially worrying considering our analysis of the purpose of tengen. Using the tengen stone to make territory is not at all efficient, since it is the only move that does not have a territorial influence of its own. And by playing it, b is already behind by komi and needs to fight to win.]
;W[gi]C[JS: After the marked move my territory seems to be pretty small and not at all worthy of the thickness I had.

P: If your territory is small, then it's small to defend it. If it's small to defend it, then it's also small to invade, so you can welcome w to make small move by reducing it further. The biggest points right now are still on the right hand side. See variation on the next move for an idea of how to attack this stone and get them.]
(;B[gf]C[P: The biggest points are on the right side of the board, so you want to build influence in that direction with your attack on the w stone. See variation.]
;W[ii];B[hj]C[P: Defending this tiny centre territory is still not important. It is even less valuable now, since these moves are helping to strengthen then w stones.]
;W[hi];B[gj];W[ij];B[ik];W[fj];B[fk];W[ej];B[ek];W[fg]C[P: See how much stronger these w stones are now than before b played h10 sequence?]
;B[dh];W[ff];B[kc]C[P: a very big move.];W[jk]C[JS: I was not quite sure what to do here. I did not want to abandon the tengen and my territory seemed so small. So I decided in the end to entirely forsake my moyo and make a new one.

P: You have committed all but about six of your stones to forming this territority -- allowing it to be broken apart like this is not an option. The best move here is to simply j8. The ladder does not work, so w cannot capture your tengen stone. See variation on next move.]
(;B[kj];W[hk];B[il];W[gk];B[kl]C[p: This move is not necessary, the w stone cannot escape.]
;W[gm];B[hl];W[gl];B[pj]C[P: Great move.];W[if];B[fn]C[JS: On second thought I do not think this was necessary.

P: No, it wasn't. But neither was wj14 so you didn't fall behind because of it ;)]
;W[qc]C[JS: I think this was a mistake for my opponent to play like this it gave me a strong wall.

P:  It is a proverb that when b has two extensions from the 4-4 stone, invading at 3-3 is urgent. If w had not done this, B could o16 or close the corner with r16. either move allows for lots of solid territory and a large moyo.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
;B[qf];W[qn]C[P: Invading the lower right corner now is urgent for b. See var on next move]
(;B[kf]C[P: This move is small and gote. It is deliberately limiting the size of b's own moyo and threatens nothing. More powerful moves would be h17 or r8. Both of these expand b's moyo by taking points that also cut into w's ability to form a moyo.

See variation for invasion of the corner.];W[jd]
(;B[kd]C[P: This is a very passive response. K17 is more active and protects the n15 area just as well. See variation.]
;W[je];B[jg];W[qk]C[P: this move is to close to bq10. After b descends, w's position is weak and there are no good follow up moves. B exploits this excellently to turn the game around.]
;B[qj];W[nk]C[P: W is greedy.];B[ol]C[JS: Was this a good move? It certainly turned out well.

P: Yes, that's quite a nice cutting move.];W[ok];B[pk];W[nl]

;B[kb];W[jb];B[ja];W[ia];B[ka];W[hb]C[P: This sequence of moves allowed white to seal up about ten points of territory while B got literally no points in exchange. There was some invasion aji on the top before bl18 - wk18]
;B[ig];W[hf];B[hg];W[gg];B[pn]C[P: Nice tesuji. W must now draw back to r5 to avoid disaster...]
;W[on];B[pm];W[oo];B[po]C[P:... but instead w sacrifices the entire right side to capture two stones.]
;W[qo]C[P: W didn't realize s/he was sacrificing the side and belatedly tries to reclaim it, but there are too many cutting points...]

;W[gj]C[P: Uh oh, game over for w ;)];B[gh]C[JS: Now I think my victory is basically assured.

P: Yes, the rest of the game is just w thrashing around hoping you make a mistake. However, without the w blunders here and in the lower right, w would have won the game easily. You won because you didn't let your play get sloppy as the game went on and were keen to profit from your opponents errors, both very good traits. However, on the whole, your style in this game was too slow, painstakingly defending small areas rather than finding the important points. In a review I once got, the reviewer gave me three simple techniques for deciding your move that I'd like to pass on.

1) Are any of your groups at risk of coming under attack? If so, defend them

2) Do your opponents groups have any weaknesses? If so, attack them.

3) If neither of these, then play the biggest point. 

You played solidly and so none of your groups ever came under attack. However, you also never managed to attack or even cut any of w's groups until w made a fatal mistake. More active play means putting pressure on your opponent in order to secure sente. I also suggest replaying some games by strong dans or pros and observing the ways they find and take big points. It can be challenging to assign a point value to a move, but the more you learn to think in those terms, the more effective your moves will be.

This is the last comment. I hope you enjoyed this review and found it useful. If you have any questions, you can reach me by email or message me on kgs.

))
(;B[jh]C[P: In the game, you played around g14. However, the top of the board is not as big as the right. The reason it's good to attack the w stone is not to try and kill it, it's to build influence elsewhere -- "Make territory by attacking". Therefore, this is the better direction of play]
;W[gg];B[jf];W[ge];B[pj]C[P: B has created a huge moyo on the right and top, and can still defend the centre territory later. After bq10, playing around r7 and invading/defending the corner are miai, meaning if w defends the corner, approach at r7 -- if w extends around r6, invade the corner at r3. B could also just r6 to force r4 later, since to me that seems the slighly better side of the exchange.]

;W[jo]C[P: After w jumps up though, B has a hard time finding a follow up. Jumping as well to h5 is making a very narrow territory while W gets a large moyo. But worse, it is using the formidable wall at d7 to make territory! Recall the proverb "use thickness to attack!" The thickness was got in exchange for allowing w to live around B7, so it needs to be used more effectively than to make a small territory.  BH3 also violates the proverb to play away from thickness. So we can reject a play around h3 as being too small.]

C[P: w k5 is less of a problem now because b has already played q6, limiting any potential moyo. B can now draw back to Q10, leaving behind the aji of invasions at r3 or around l4/m3. In my opinion, this is the best way to play as b.]
