[cg][cm][qn][mo]C[here you got to make shape for life but your not 100% alive and white has sente to do what ever he wants including attacking one of your three week groups or approaching your top right corner this is not a good situation at all for black.
 When you play Go not only must you worry about how can I play but also how will my opponent play]

Not really sure, how i should have developed the game from
here. Any comment would be appreciated.

From here we follow the basic rules of where to play next we look at whats in danger like the mark stones we worry about them first after we save or make them live we look at whats weak or what can be attacked by both us and our opponent  than we play whats big than whats small.]
