TM[1800]

C[EmTom: Hi This game turned into big fight and its the kind of game that i hate with passion. I dont play fighting games very often so im sure i made lots of errors during this game. Please point out more serious mistakes. Im also curious about the endgame. I lost only by 3,5 and i feel i could have won the game if i played the endgame correctly. Thanks in advance for your review :)

Ilya: I hope my review will be useful for you. Keep in mind that reviewing fighting is quite hard as I could misread something. In most cases I showed the most probably variation as I simply couldn't show all possible variations. There is a danger that I missed something important though.]

;B[qf];W[qi]TR[qf]C[Ilya: Kogo's joseki dictonary claims that this pincer is non-joseki. Let me quote the dictionary:

The two-space low pincer is not as forceful as the one-space pincer, nor as relaxed as the three-space pincer, which is most often used as a dual purpose move to pincer and extend at the same time. Neither fish nor fowl, the two-space low pincer is less able to secure territory compared to the one-space pincer, if the selected variation comes to that, and perhaps more likely to later come under attack if Black establishes a base for the marked stone.]
;B[of];W[nd]TR[qi]LB[oi:A]C[Ilya: the reason why Kogo's dictionary says that marked stone is wrong play is that black can easily cap it with A.]
;B[qc];W[qd];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qe];B[ob];W[nb]TR[of]LB[mc:A]
[mf:B][ql:C]C[EmTom: Ok so this is obviously my mistake... what happened after that was quite bad for w. Any ideas how to contain b in the corner?

Ilya: as you find out later your move only works when there is no marked black stone. With this stone you can play A if you wish to contain black in the corner. On the other hand you have no territory on the top yet so containing black in gote is probably not a very good strategy. I'd consider one of two points: B (starts attack on two black stones), C (stabilizes white on the right aiming at A later).]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[od];W[oe];B[ne];W[pe];B[pc]
(;W[rg]LB[rf:A]C[Ilya: this move is better be played at A. See variations.]

(;B[pf];W[rf]LB[nf:A]C[EmTom: I know i have to say thanks to my opponent here... He could have killed me. Anyway he made a mistake and i started a big fight. Im not sure if it was good idea, but since he has corner and outside i thought i have to separate him and try to gain from attacking 2 groups at once.

Ilya: I don't see any way for black to kill anything here.]
;B[ph]LB[nf:A]C[Ilya: here your opponent helps you - by itself this move does practically nothing and leaves cut at A.]

(;W[nf]LB[lc:B][me:A]C[Ilya: it might be too dangerous to cut here right now. After black plays A he can aim at B to capture the marked stones. I think it would be sufficient just play white A (see variation).]
;B[me];W[ng];B[qh];W[rh];B[pi];W[qj]
(;B[le]TR[nb][nc][nd]LB[lc:A]C[Ilya: Instead of last move play at A by black would threaten to capture the marked stones. There are many complex variations arising and I *think* white can escape but still black gets a good position. I've showed one of simple variations where black doesn't try to capture white but simply gets a good position.]
;W[oj]SQ[nf][ng]TR[nb][nc][nd]LB[kc:B][nh:A]C[Ilya: both white groups seems to be weak. The upper marked groups needs move at B to be at safety. The cutting marked group also can be put under the attack. This is a result of premature cut. Not sure what is the best move here. I'd probably chose B to put one of white groups in safety.

Your move doesn't work as black can play at A and escape. See variations on the next move.]

(;B[pj]TR[of][pf][ph][pi][qf][qh]C[Ilya: in the actual game black played suboptimally. This move achives nothing and takes away perhaps an important liberty from his group. And black didn't manage to escape with his marked group in sente.This allowed you to get a good result in the end.]
;W[pk];B[nh];W[lg];B[ni]TR[nb][nc][nd]LB[mh:A]C[Ilya: Last move by black must be at A. This lets black to end in sente and capture the three marked stones.]
;W[mh];B[nj];W[kc]LB[qk:A]C[Ilya: you managed to save the marked stones thanks to the slack play by black. But even now there is still an annoying aji at A. See the variation what happens if black plays A now.]

(;B[lc]C[Ilya: Thank you moves by black - it only helps white to fortify his group.]

;W[li];B[mf];W[mg];B[ji];W[kk];B[nk];W[jj]C[Ilya: very good! Important point for both.]
;B[ii];W[ik]LB[hk:A]C[Ilya: slow - better to play at A.];B[df]
;W[fe];B[fg]
(;W[ch]LB[eg:A]C[Ilya: you could just cut though the keima at A as the ladder doesn't work for black. See variation.]

(;W[ei]LB[di:A]C[EmTom: Giving away c12 for a wall and attack at b group in the center. Not sure if it was worth it.

Ilya: no need to give away c12. You could play at A. See variation.]
;B[ci];W[md]TR[lc][mc]LB[if:A][ig:C][jf:B]C[Ilya: don't always expect your opponent to save non-essential stones. He could try to escape instead of saving the marked stones. Key point to attack seems to be A which either threatens to cut at B or to spoil an eye space at C.]
;B[ld];W[kf];B[jf]
(;W[kg]LB[hg:B][jh:A]C[Ilya: this move is bad - right now your opponent have no eyes at all. Your move only spoils eye space at A but it is not hard enough. Play at B seems to be more interesting. See variation.]
;B[ff];W[ef];B[ge];W[fd];B[hd];W[hc];B[gi];W[fh]LB[fj:B][gk:A]
C[Ilya: I don't like this move - black can just jump at A and escape leaving only couple stones to you to capture in gote. I'd play B here - first of all it helps to connect white stones and blocks black who is still no alive yet.]
;B[gh];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf];B[hg];W[he];B[if];W[gd];B[gk]C[Ilya: black escapes ...]
;W[hl]LB[ih:A]C[Ilya: it is probably a bit pointless to attack black now as he can build two eyes at any moment with play A.]

C[Ilya: to attack the marked stones is an interesting idea. But if you remeber there is an aji at A black may use now to counter the attack.]
;B[ok];W[pl]C[Ilya: in the actual game black helps you to fix the problem.]
;B[nl];W[mm];B[om];W[pm]LB[qn:A]C[Ilya: better to play at A. It encloses your territory on the right.]

C[EmTom: J5 would be better i suppose...

Ilya: then black would enter at K6. I guess it were better to play J6 instead of J8. You'd lose a one stone only then.]

;W[sd];B[sc];W[ra]LB[se:A]C[Ilya: this move doesn't work right now as you find later. Simply protecting at A would be a sente for you. If black plays elsewhere after white A you indeed can make a seki in the corner.]
