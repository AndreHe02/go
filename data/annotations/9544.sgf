C[The opponent applied a very aggressive approach and I was not sure what was the best way of dealing with that.

J: I think it's just a matter of not following him, looking for best moves in all the board instead of responding to his moves

I have stopped adding comments at 150 or so, but a few moves before the game was still in your favour. Only real important thing: do not reply to all moves. This applies to every opponent but specially to ones like this.

Any other question just let me know.

Good luck,

C[J: I'd just taken other corner];W[fc];B[jd]C[J: why not just get another corner? Opponents like this one are quite... disturbing, but playing calm is the best way to deal with them]
;W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[bb];W[fd];B[ee];W[kc]C[J: ... all the last moves are rather small taking into account 2 corners are still unclaimed!]
;B[cp]C[J: good, finally!];W[cl];B[eq];W[co];B[dj]C[J: here I think C10 is better, more pressure]
;W[cj];B[dn];W[cn];B[dl];W[do]C[J: again you're "following". Best is to ignore and take the other corner]
;B[dm];W[di]C[J: now look at your D8 group, quite useless stones, while his are making territory. Just playing D4 instead of this whole sequence is better for you]

(;B[ek]C[J: this is really strange... why not C9??];W[ck];B[dp]
C[J: this one's good!];W[eo];B[pp]C[J: great! I can't see how you end losing??]
;W[mq];B[pq];W[iq];B[qn]C[J: a bit shy, but I understand your feeling. Better a longer extension]
;W[ql];B[ei]C[J: with E5 open, I really don't like this move, does not accomplish a big deal for you. C12 better if you want to play that side.

Or, if you are worried about D10's life, then your move is ok!]
;W[dh];B[qf];W[pf];B[qe];W[od];B[qc]C[J: why not P18?];W[ob]
C[J: this guy's a bully. If you manage to play calmly you'll crush him no problem at all]
;B[pc];W[jc];B[pg];W[ph];B[og];W[qh];B[oe];W[id];B[hq]C[J: second time you attach while extending... this tends to reinforce the opponent. G3 better, then you can aim at L3]
