so white wants to play up the right edge
to prvent black playing there.];B[jd]
(;W[cf]C[Here I would prefer to play on the right edge for white - see
the variation.  But this move is also a fine one.];B[fd]

his moyo.];B[pj];W[pq]
(;B[jq]LB[qo:A][po:4]C[If move 4 is at A, this is definately the right move.  Now I
am not so sure.  Playing one point higher might be better.]
;W[hq];B[mq];W[io]
(;B[hr]C[I don't like this move since it makes the lower left corner more
solid, and leaves W stronger toward the outside.  Black's opening
with all stones high emphasises the center, so he should try
to come out here with stones toward the outside.];W[gr];B[ir]
;W[gq]C[After this exchange it is harder to get into the lower left,
so it feels like W is a little ahead.]
(;B[eg]LB[cn:B][dj:A][ci:8]C[This would be a good move if 8 was at A, so white would have
to answer.  But in this game it seems a little slow.  I would
prefer to play in the lower right.

If B can make some gain in the lower right with sente, he could
come back and play at A or B];W[qf]
(;B[ei]C[This move is too slow.  You have to attack the stone in the upper
right and make territory white chasing it.    One of the principles of playing 3-star is to form a big moyo,
then when the opponent invades, take territory by attacking him.]
;W[nd]
(;B[oe]C[This move makes things a little too easy for white.  B has the
advantage here, so W should not be able to get an easy life on
both sides.  One of the approach stones should die, or at least
become very weak.  Often it is better ot attatch to one of the
stones making the double approach.]
(;W[mf]C[usually at this point W would play 3-3.  Since he didn't he is
trying to live on both sides.

So this move looks like an overplay.  Since W didn't take the
corner, B should look at taking it himself.

You can look at the cut to the left, or playing to the right
first, then cutting, or just playing 3-3]
(;B[og]C[This move is probably wrong, since it lets W get both sides.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[This move follows the principle of making a straight line for
your stones, but blocking the other way might be better.];W[qd]
;B[ld];W[pb]
(;B[ob]C[You could cut now, and make a big central moyo.];W[qb]

(;B[oc]C[Perhaps you could cut now rather than playing here.]
;W[md]
(;B[lc]C[Even if W plays here he won't get much.  I would prefer to attack
from the outside.];W[mh]C[Now W has reasonable groups on both sides, and took the corner,
so B must have made a mistake.  This result is too good for W.]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[qh];W[pf];B[of];W[rh]
(;B[mk]LB[mj:A][po:4][io:14]TR[ld][jd][fd][eg][ei]C[I don't think you can kill the W group with this move.  Since
W has stones 14 and 4 behind it, this move will not gain anything.
It won't take territory, and its strength won't help attack 4
or 14, which are both pretty strong.  So it is attacking from
the wrong direction.

The marked stones make a pocket of territory in the center.  You don't want to chase W into this pocket unless either 1) you
can expect to kill him, or 2) the moves you get while chasing
him will be useful to support an attack on another group or an
invasion.

If you do want to attack from this side, I prefer A, since it
more tightly surrounds the weak group.

With this move, you should plan to drive white to connect to
his 14 stone, while you get stones to the left of his group,
and then use those stones to support an invasion of the lower
left side.

You could also think about peeping first, since you have a strong
3 stone black wall.];W[jg];B[ji]LB[mj:A][mk:43]C[This move does not have a very good relationship with the stone
43.  It leaves a hole that W can come through.  It would be a
fine move if 43 was at A];W[lj];B[kl];W[jj]
(;B[ii]C[Here I would look at going to the right instead.  It looks like
a stronger attack.];W[ki];B[kk];W[kj]
(;B[hl]C[Playing one move higher is a stronger attack.  You don't want
to leave white big holes to get out through.];W[ij];B[ig]C[I don't understand this move.  Attaching to the white stone will
make it stronger.  You want to avoid this kind of move when you
are attacking a group.];W[if];B[hi];W[hj]
(;B[hg]LB[if:56][ig:55]C[This move is away from the main attack.  you should play to surround
white, and get some stones near the lower left side.

Exchanging 55 for 56 cost you a move here, since you came back
to 59.];W[il];B[im];W[jl]
(;B[jn]LB[jm:A]C[This move makes a strange shape.  After W's next move, you don't
want to cut since it makes an empty triangle.  It should ber
at A.

It's unclear to me what you are trying to do with this attack.
Killing the W stones is unreasonable, so you should pick the
way you want them to connect out.  It seems best for you if they
connect down throught the middle while you play to the left,
to support an invasion near the lower left.];W[km]
(;B[ml]C[Playing here lets white cature a stone on the left and make his
lower left side even stronger. you want to defend the other side.]
;W[hm];B[jo];W[jm];B[in];W[gl];B[hn];W[gm]C[Now white has strengthed his hold on the lower left corner and
side.  And his center group is safe.

(;B[dk]C[This is an interesting way to get into the white area.  And in
this game it worked out well.]
(;W[dj]C[Usually you would expect white to cut across the knight's move
rather than play here.];B[ej]
(;W[ek]C[Cutting here did not work out very well for white.  Since he
has got everything he wanted during this game I guess he got
a little greedy.

Playing to the left is probably better.];B[ck]C[good move];W[bd]

white is still a little ahead.]
(;W[jf]C[The lower right is bigger]
(;B[qm]C[This is a good move and makes the game close again.  Since black
is still a little behind, he might consider the peep in the corner.
Black is
reasonably strong around here, so if white gets an outside wall
he probably won't be able to use it for much.];W[qn];B[pm];W[nq]

move 123, you should jump into the corner.  I
don't think he can cut you off and kill you if you do.
