C[Alcibaides [13k\]: hi, gl
 I went an entire summer without playing go. I started playing again and I am straddling the 12-13 kyu level. This was an interesting game I lost by half a point. I haven't submitted to this site in a while and when I looked at an old game of mine I didn't remember ever being that bad! Any comments would be appreciated.


H: 

Hi, I'm Hannes and will review for black's side.];B[pd];W[pp]
;B[dc];W[cq]LB[dc:A][ce:B]C[Should I approach that 3x3 before securing my own unbalanced corner? I rarely see this. I was tempted to play 4x4 and trade territory for influence early.

H:
It is just as you say. The 3-3 goes straight for territory, the 4-4 mainly for influence, while the 3-4 (A) is rather balanced in this respect.

If you choose to play A, I see no real difference in either heading for B or attacking one of white's corners. It's a question of style (secure territory vs. early fighting).

No objections from my side.];B[ce];W[ip];B[co]LB[jc:C][nc:B]
[qf:A][qj:D][co:E]C[H: 
Same situation here. You may either choose to carefully extend the black corners (A, B), or head for the sides (K, D). Or you start approaching white (preventing his extensions) by playing at E. 
E is fine.];W[fp];B[en]LB[cj:D][cl:B][en:A][dp:C]C[H: 
I'm not sure, what A aims at.

If black wants to attack white (provoking some defensive move), C might have been an option. A does not attack white.

If it is about building a stable base on the left, B would have been the right spot.

Playing A, however, leaves an easy invasion for white around D. Note that white can play a two-space jump as a follow up move independently from the site black attacks the invasion  (see variation)]

(;W[mq];B[qn]LB[ck:C][cl:B][mq:A]TR[en][co]C[H: 

White did not invade. Stabilizing the marked black stones on the left side (by playing B, or even C) is a must.]
;W[ql];B[on]C[H:
This one space jump is always a good idea.
(Though not the only option, cf. http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=PincerPath&page=44PointLowApproachOneSpaceLowPincer)]
;W[pj];B[qh]LB[pd:B][qf:C][qh:A][pl:F][mn:E][rp:D]TR[on][qn]
C[H:

The reason for playing A obviously is not to allow white build a (big) base on the right. However, I think that both, timing and position (A) are not well-chosen, and this is for the following reason:

A-B are only very loosely connected. So A is not in a strong position which would be better for using it for an attack.

Just like A-B, the marked stones below the white group are weak as well.

My suggestion is to either extend the upper right more securely (like at C), or to strenghten the lower black group before attacking the white stones. This could be done by either jumping into the open at E, by heading for some side/corner space at D, or combining it with an attack on white at F (which may lead to a dangerous fight as white may aim at disconnecting the marked black stones).]
;W[ph]LB[pd:A][qh:B]C[H: 

this is a reaction black can live with as it allows for strengthening the connection between A and B.]
;B[qg]LB[qi:A]C[H:

...as he does. Good move.

Note that white still has no real stable base on the right (he needs the next move at A). But he has gained some influence towards the center.]
;W[qi];B[pg];W[oh];B[og];W[rh];B[rg];W[ri];B[jd]LB[ng:A][nh:B]
[cj:E][on:C][qn:D]C[H: 

Good move. (Although playing around E is still more important)

Black refrains from extending the wall (A), which would have made the white wall stronger as well (B). This, however would have made the C-D groups's live even harder.]
;W[ni];B[mo]C[H: 

black decides to rescue his group. Good.];W[nl];B[nm]LB[mm:A]
TR[on][mo]C[H: 

Be careful with contact moves. They tend to make the attacked stone stronger, and black is in danger of creating a clumsy group. Playing lightly usually is the better option when "fleeing" from a bad position.

Playing A would have been better. (Good shape together with the marked black stones)]
;W[mm];B[mn];W[om];B[nn];W[ml];B[np]LB[jn:B][kn:A]C[H:

Not a bad move (trying to make space for an eye), but I would have chosen to jump into the free space in the center (A or probably even B).]
;W[nq];B[op];W[oq];B[oo];W[qp]C[H:

good result for black. But still just one eye.];B[ln]LB[kn:A]
[ln:B]C[H: 

Playing A still is more lightly and not as slow as B];W[nc]
;B[pb]C[With backup should I have pincered him at M 17 instead of solidifying the corner?

H: 

White should have a hard time anyway (black will attack from left and right). Simply securing the corner seems quite sensible to me.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[qb];B[rd]LB[re:A]C[H:

Good defense from black in this corner. White cannot live here.

A is possible, too if you know the L-group (cf. http://senseis.xmp.net/?LGroup)]
;W[rc];B[sd];W[sc];B[rf];W[ra];B[lc]C[I guess it is stronger now with thickness but oh crap why didn't I kill with T 18?

H:

Yes. Black lost 10 points as he did not kill the white group.]
;W[sb];B[nd]LB[md:A][mf:B]C[H: 

No need to make a contact move (although it did not matter in the course of this game). A or B would have been enough to put white under pressure.]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[mb];B[mc];W[ob];B[pa]C[H: 
Good move preventing white from connecting his groups.];W[qa]
;B[oc]LB[la:B][na:A]C[H: 

Actually, black does not need to attack. White needs both, A and B for this group to live. So if he plays one, black will answer with the other.]
;W[nb];B[la]LB[cj:A][ck:B]C[H:

Again, black does not need to attack this group. It already is dead as white cannot make two eyes with this line of 4 stones. So black looses one more move.

Left side (A,B) is still open.];W[fc];B[hc]C[H:

Good move. This is black's oportunity to push white while building territory of his own.]
;W[fe];B[he]LB[he:A]TR[kd][ld][md][je][ke][le][me][ne][lf][mf]
[nf]C[H:

Good move again. A helps the potential territory on the right (marked with triangles)]
;W[eg];B[gg]LB[cg:A][gg:F][kg:C][ch:B][cj:D][ck:E]TR[je][ke]
[le][me][jf][kf][lf][mf]C[H: 

A or B would have been better, as the (triangled) territory around C is not made more secure (and not much bigger) than before.

With A or B (or D, E, as always), black would have gotten direct points on the left side.

With black playing F, white can flee right into what could have been black's territory on the left.]
;W[di];B[dk]LB[lf:E][ih:C][kh:D][fi:B][ck:A]C[H:

Defending on the lower position (A) would make it more difficult for white to settle himself on the left side.
(Additionally, white may be forced to continue by playing around B. Then black may defend at C or D, closing his open potential territory around E.]
;W[ck];B[cl];W[cj];B[ek]LB[bh:B][ch:A]C[H:

Not bad. The black group should be stable by now.

Alternatively, black could try to steal white's base by playing at B or A.]
;W[cg];B[bf];W[bg];B[eb];W[fi];B[gi]LB[lf:B][hi:A]C[H:

Again a contact move thay may lead to a fight. Playing A would have been as well. Closing the B-territory is an option as well.]
;W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[mh];W[mi]
(;B[nh]LB[lh:A]C[Is this chunk of center I am trying to circle off too big to be a true moyo? I find I am trying to build framework that may be too big and it is never quite worth what I expect.

H:

Playing A would have stopped white as weil, but black would have been in lead. (cf. variation)]
;W[gr];B[lq]C[H:

Dangerous. White could simply cut this stone off (cf. variation)]

(;W[lr];B[kq];W[kr];B[ko];W[jq];B[mp]C[H:

Black is alive, now. So we should keep in mind that this group can be used for attacking and can no longer be put under pressure from white.]
;W[pm];B[pn];W[rm];B[rn];W[lm];B[kn]LB[lm:A]C[H: 

unnecessary move. Black does not need to respond to white A (which aims at extending white's territory).]
;W[km];B[jn]LB[gb:C][ed:D][ee:E][ji:A][bp:B]C[H:

Unnecessary again.  Better expand black's territory above e.g. by playing A.

Alternatively, B, C or D (with follow up at E) are points where black could make use of him being in forehand (sente).]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[ji];B[kh];W[li];B[jh];W[ki];B[ii];W[kg];B[lf]
C[H:

Good defense.];W[ih];B[jg];W[ij];B[hi];W[hj];B[gk];W[jm];B[hk]
LB[il:B][gm:A]C[should I have continued pushing south at G 7 to reduce or played G 6 to seal him in a little more instead? This move feels bad in retrospect.

H: 

I cannot see what G7 (A) would help.

B would have been a good reducing move.];W[ik];B[fl];W[il];B[in]
LB[hm:A]C[H:

This move does not yield anything, does it?
A would have earned some points on the left, but attacking white (starting the endgame) would have been my preferred choice.]
;W[gn];B[ho];W[hp];B[go];W[fo];B[fn];W[hm];B[hn];W[gh];B[hh]
;W[fh];B[gf];W[ff];B[gd];W[fd];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb];W[fg];B[dp]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[eq];B[gp];W[gq]LB[gn:A]C[I am wondering why I did not capture G 6 or try to split at J 7 of H 8 then capture. I think I wasted some moves.

H:

Capturing A would be gote (you loose the initiative). As long as your oponent needs to respond to your moves, you can play A any time later.]
;B[eo];W[fq]C[H:

All good moves keeping black sente.];B[bp];W[bl];B[bm]TR[dk]
[cl]C[Oops.

H:

Yes, a misreading. The double hane (marked stones) should make black double-think his move.]

;W[ig];B[kf]C[I think I should have run at K 14 instead, that stone wasn't going anywhere and it would have promoted better shape.

Yes.];W[jf];B[kg];W[if];B[hg];W[ge];B[hd];W[kc];B[jc];W[kd]

C[I didn't have to do that did I? Even if I let him play there I'd have him in the same position, he is running nowhere in close quarters and I jumped at shadows.

H:

Yes. 

(The important think to notice is that the black A group has only one liberty which would be fatal, if the white B group was not in the same state. White's C-group  cannot accomplish anything, here.)]
;W[gl];B[hf]LB[hh:C][dm:D][fm:A][gm:E][ko:F]C[Should have connected at F 7 rather than take I think. Have I played too passively generally? I feel like I am playing passively and making mistakes because I am afraid of making a mistake.

H:

As this was not the last liberty of the C group, the move was not necessary. And as you say, the left D group does not yet have two eyes! Better do something about that.

You may capture at E to connect with the F group or (as you propose) play A.]
;W[fm];B[el];W[bq];B[gm];W[im];B[hl];W[ro];B[so];W[sp]C[I should have played there and reduced earlier.

H:

No. You should keep endgame moves for the end game. They may e.g. help you as threats in Ko situations.]

C[Am I playing these in remotely the right order? I try to think about what move is worth the most points and allows me to keep sente but I think I mess up here sometimes.

H: 

The main "rule" is: play moves that keep you in sente, and your moves do just that. Nothing to object.]
;B[ka]C[I didn't need to do that, he wasn't going anywhere even if he took.

H:

Yes.];W[tt]C[Why I didn't push at R 7, make him connect, and spend an extra point of terriotry I'll never know. That last connection was the thing that cost me the game.

H: 

As I hope to have shown, there was more than one oportunity to re-balance the scores. So don't worry about this one too much.]

[gl][em][fm][dn][gn][do][jo][lo][no][kp][lp]C[H:

Trying to summarize I'd say the following:

- Black showed good reading in most close situations. Don't worry about "real" mistakes like in the upper right corner.

- When defending, black should more often check whether the defensive move is necessary which means
- - can your opponent really hurt you, if you do not respond as you plan to do?
- - if his attack does indeed hurt you, is there still a more important point on the board that would give you more than you loose by ignoring the attack? 

Which leads to the last one:

- Even when in a fight, take your time to re-evaluate the overall situation instead of being focused on the close range situation alone.


(All of this sounds very generic. Who should not consider the overall situation? :-) I hope my comments make clear why I think black might benefit from concentrating on them.)


Thanks for letting me review this game.
