This time i send a won game for commenting this does offcourse not mean that its perfeft :) it's far from.

I have added some comments and variations on my thougts of the game.

Thanx in advance,
Auke-Dirk

< Hello my name is Klaus Petri
< I will try my best to give you a helpfull review.
< sorry if my english is not perfect.


 you won with +15,5 a solid win.

Things to look at:
The invasion sequences with g17 instead of J16
The different possibilitys to expand / reduce the black lower side. This is where bouth playerd failed to take advantage.
I dont think the other comments are realy importand to improove your game. And I might even be mistaken here ore there.

Is it possible for you to show me some different variations.
Because i think this situation happens a lot. So any knowledge would hellp.

black
