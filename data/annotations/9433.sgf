C[Actorios [2k\]: Hello, I would be glad if you could provide a review from White's point of view. I've tried to highlight the key moments and questions I had as I played but I would be glad if you could highlight to me bad or weak moves I played and appropriate alternatives.
Many thanks in advance.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn]
;B[jp]LB[po:A][qn:B][pn:C]C[Kobayashi opening...

Usually it is better for w to approach the corner at A, B or C.]
;W[ql]C[Actorios [2k\]: Was this invasion (and invasion point appropriate?)

This is slightly inferior theoratically as compared to approaching the corner.]
;B[qn];W[qi]LB[qg:A]C[Black A is urgent (to attack the 2 space).]
;B[fc];W[hc]C[Actorios [2k\]: I thought I could play the pincer. If Black played in the corner, I was expecting to build a wall facing my other corner.]

;B[me]LB[gd:A][ge:B]C[Actorios [2k\]: I'm not very used to play this classic joseki. Did I play it out correctly (especially after this move)? What are potential continuation for White in this position?

O17 is correct.

Personally, I don't like this joseki as b, I feel the influence is not thick at all as w can play A or B later.]
;W[nc];B[qg]LB[gd:A][ge:B][cc:C]C[Honte (proper move) for b is either A or B.

However, as 3-3 is still open, b can still omit A or B for the time being.]
;W[oi];B[om];W[ok]LB[pj:A][qj:B][fo:C]C[Actorios [2k\]: this feels very small... I saw this move in a book recently so I gave it a try. Is it appropriate in this position?

This is honte, if you tenuki here, b got A or B later which is very severe.

B shd play C instead of Q17.];B[pc]LB[fo:A]C[This is a questionable move.

First of all, it has no threat on O17 group, it is only securing the points at the corner.

Secondly the focus of this game is the lower side moyo, so b should actually play F5.]
;W[ob]LB[hq:A][fo:B]C[This is slow move, u should invade at A now before the moyo gets too big.

B should play F5 instead of C8.];B[cl];W[cj];B[dk]

;W[fp];B[co];W[er]TR[dk][cl][dr][cr]C[Actorios [2k\]: I checked the ladder first so I felt it was a decent outcome in this situation.

This is an even result, b got 2 marked stones strongthen, w managed to capture 2 marked b stones n destroyed the lower left part of b's moyo.]
;B[hq]LB[cc:A]C[B should play A directly, H3 look small here.]
;W[gp]C[Slow move. 

If you tenuki b play at this spot, u juz need to play F5, or if b seal up at G5, u play M3.]

(;B[hp]C[This is losing move of black, if w alive actually game over.]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[ir];B[gq];W[ji]C[Actorios [2k\]: This invasion was painful... I feel I was very slack in the exchange (plays on the 2nd line / bad shape). Was there an better line of play? Was the invasion inappropriate in the first place?

2nd line moves are good for making eye and since you are alive now, so this is not painful but actually sweet :)]
;B[pj]LB[oj:A]C[Here, the correct move to answer this peep is A.]

(;W[pi]C[This is very dangerous.];B[rk]TR[mi][mj][mk][ml]C[Actorios [2k\]; What is the best way to deal with this situation? I frequently encounter it and never feel very satisfied from the outcome? I guess black's thickness makes it even more painful.]
