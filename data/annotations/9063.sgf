C[Ginno [2k\]: salut
Ginno [2k\]: have fun

-Hi, I'm Amar. I'm 2 dan and used to play on KGS. I don't play often anymore though. 

The main problem with your play this game was in relation to your weak groups and also creating weak groups when you didn't need to. The mid left and bottom left was the worst situation. I outlined some of the parts of why you shouldn't have had a weak group there and could have been the one attacking. Sometimes, it only takes one move for the one attacking to switch roles. 

There was still some things you could have done with certain moves but it didn't turn out well for you. I didn't review your yose much but you could work on that though a lot of it seems to be mistakes that you could have seen already or you just went oh damn, I missed that. Overall though, just keep practicing playing more solidly and I'm sure you'll improve!]
;B[pd];W[po];B[dd];W[do];B[jd];W[jo];B[oq]C[- This is an unusual move I believe? Was there a reason to play this one rather than the standard Q3 or other?]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[op];B[nq];W[kq]LB[mp:A][rq:B]
(;B[mp]C[Ginno [2k\]: maybe this is too small?

- Honestly, I'm conflicted by this move, I think S3 is the best move but at least you're not shut in. I still think S3 is the move you need though.]
;W[pj];B[qh];W[nc]LB[pb:B][oc:A]
(;B[oc];W[qc]LB[ob:B][qd:A]C[- A turned out okay for you as well but B can be done since you have stones on each side.]

(;B[qd];W[ob]
(;B[pb];W[pc];B[od];W[qb];B[nb];W[pa];B[mb]C[Ginno [2k\]: here it seemed ok for b : influence outside (with some aji on top) and w has little points. is it right?

- I think the thing you have to remember is you already invested two stones in that area while white had none to begin with. It's still not a serious mistake but you could have done more to use those two stones.]
;W[cf];B[ch]C[Ginno [2k\]: what would be better? c15?

- Your pincer is fine, white is running to your influence. I don't like C15 in this situation.]
;W[ef];B[fd];W[bd];B[cc];W[cj];B[eh]C[Ginno [2k\]: g14 instead to build moyo & give away the stone?

- No, I don't know why you would want to do that. I would want to push white into your influence to attack and gain points at the top. The main point of influence is to use it to attack or gain somewhere else usually.]
;W[gf]LB[hd:A][gh:B]
(;B[hd]C[Ginno [2k\]: is g12 imperative?
Ginno [2k\]: i wanted to treat c12 lightly

-This was bad, first honest mistake in my opinion. You made white's weak group become strong because now he can attack you. C12 isn't light, it's weak.]
;W[hh]LB[bj:B][dj:A][ej:C]
(;B[dj]C[- This did not turn out well for you but I'll see if there was anything else with this move.]
;W[ci];B[di];W[bh]LB[ck:A][dl:B]
(;B[ck]C[Ginno [2k\]: clear mistake
Ginno [2k\]: any better sequence for this variation is welcome

-Yes, this is a mistake that made you even more heavy with no eyes.]

;B[dm];W[cl];B[cm];W[bk];B[bl];W[ck];B[en]C[Ginno [2k\]: connection is better (since b is weak) ?

- Yes, the peep isn't good for you but it's not that huge right now.]

;W[kc]C[Ginno [2k\]: now i'm seeing it could be interesting to build strengh above this invasion to cut h12 and give life to h9

-Your variations were a bit weird but I agree with the concept of cutting white off and making your weak group stronger. I also just think the net is the most solid move in this situation.]
