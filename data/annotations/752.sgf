;B[dp]C[General Comments

Strategically, you played more reasonable moves than White. Your problems
seem to be in handling fights, e.g. on the left edge and when White played
underneath your stone on the top edge. The net result was that White had a
noticable but not huge lead after the middle game.

You pulled back well in the endgame and almost made it (and missed a chance
for a half-point win on your last move!).];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd]
;B[de];W[cj];B[ch]LB[cg:a]C[Good - this protects your corner's main weakness (a White move at
'a' (C13) would threaten to slide into the corner) and attacks the White
stone.];W[cm];B[fq]LB[co:a][jc:b][pj:c]C[A good solid move, leaving a good follow-up at 'a' (C5) (which
would secure the corner territory and weaken the White stones). Now there
are two really big areas to play: around 'b' (K17) to give you a
"double-wing" formation around the top left, or 'c' (Q10) to break up
White's side. So, you're guaranteed to get one of them.];W[cf]
LB[dg:a]C[This looks like an overplay. The existing White stones on the left
aren't completely settled and White is starting another group in the same
area. I would answer at 'a' (D13), aiming to keep the two White groups
separated. White should be able to live in the corner, but you'll get useful
stones facing along the top edge and/or down the left - see the variation
for the sort of thing that might happen.]
(;B[df]LB[dg:a]C[I prefer 'a' (D13) - see comments and variation on the previous
move.];W[cg];B[dg];W[bh];B[ce]LB[dh:a][bi:b]C[I think I'd prefer to connect with 'a' (D12), forcing White to
join up with 'b' (B11). After that you have no weaknesses and can extend
along the top with no problems left behind.];W[ci];B[jd];W[dh]
;B[eh]LB[nc:a]C[If you didn't play here, I don't think White would because it's very
close to his own strong group. I'd prefer 'a' (O17), attacking the top
right corner and giving you a good framework along the top.]
;W[jb]LB[lc:a]C[Better for White to play 'a', strengthening his corner and
threatening to slide to K18 next.]
(;B[ib]LB[kc:a]C[Hitting a weak stone like this is usually not a good idea because,
as happens in the game, it gives your opponent chances to strengthen the
stone. I suggest 'a' (L17) - see variation on previous move.]
;W[ic]
(;B[hc]LB[jc:a][id:b]C[Once you've played the contact move at J18, you need to play 'a'
(K17) here. With your move, if WHite answers at 'b' (J16) then your
original extension is completely cut off and down to three liberties, while
all the White stones on the top edge are connected.

See previous move for what happens after 'a'.];W[jc];B[id];W[hb]
;B[gb];W[ia];B[gc];W[kd];B[ke];W[ld];B[jf];W[bp]
(;B[co]LB[cq:a]C[You could answer at 'a' (C3), which leaves you with the
possibility of capturing the White stone at B4 later (see variation on
previous move). However, your idea of building a wall in sente and then
using that to make territory along the bottom edge isn't bad.]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[dm];W[cl];B[cr]LB[nq:a][mq:b]C[Now that you've built your wall you need to use it, e.g. by playing
'a' (O3). Playing C2 is gote (and locally should be C3), giving White
chance to negate your wall, e.g. by playing 'a'  or 'b' (N3).]
;W[ek]C[This stops you building on a really big scale in the centre, but I
think the bottom edge was more urgent.];B[nq]C[Very good.];W[lq]
LB[pn:a][kp:b]C[Given your wall to the left, this is an overplay by White. I'd have
played something like 'a' (Q6), which you could have answered around 'b'
(M4).];B[no]LB[pn:a][jq:b]C[Good. This creates two threats: surrounding White's corner with 'a'
(Q6) or attacking the pincer stone with 'b' (K3)>];W[pn];B[pr]
LB[nm:a][jq:b]C[This isn't a good idea when your opponent has played the low
one-space pincer: if White answers at the 3-3 point then you don't have room
to extend along the edge to make eye space, plus you've lost the possibility
of invading at the 3-3 point later. You should either keep jumping out with
'a' (O7) or attack with 'b' (K3).];W[iq];B[qq];W[qp];B[qi]LB[ql:a]
C[This gives White the chance to strengthen his stones by attacking
your R11 stone. Playing 'a' (R8) to attack the three White stones looks
more interesting.];W[qk];B[qf];W[pf]
(;B[qe]LB[pe:a]C[Ladders are in your favour, so wedging in at 'a' (Q15) looks
possible.

;B[mh];W[ne]C[Doesn't look necessary.];B[kh]C[So looking at the score, I estimate:

Black
  top left & centre: 30
  right edge: 5
  bottom left: 10
  bottom right: 10
  total: 55

White
  left edge: 20
  top right 30
  bottom right 10
  bottom edge 5
  total: 65

White has sente, but he does have a couple of weak stones at the bottom that
you might be able to harass. You also have chance to expand the top
left/centre territory. White seems to be winning, but you're still in the
game.];W[ok];B[hp]C[Good idea - make some territory by attacking.]
;W[hq];B[gq];W[ip];B[ho];W[lo];B[nm];W[rj]C[This is a big move because it's "double-sente" - sente for both
players.];B[ri];W[rq];B[rr];W[pq];B[qr];W[on];B[nn];W[om]C[Looks small and gote.]

than your move.];W[hl];B[gl];W[gk];B[gm];W[hj];B[hi];W[ij];B[ii]
