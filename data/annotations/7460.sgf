C[Hi Actorios - I'm happy to help review your game.  I'm a 3-4k on KGS, so take my advice with a grain of salt!

Brucewayne];B[pq];W[qd];B[dc];W[dp]C[Actorios [8k\]: I always play hoshi as second move when playing white because I feel I'm losing the fuseki when I try to generate 2 shimari from komoku in white

BW - Frankly, I think deep analysis on fuseki is a waste of time for people around our rank.  As long as you play resonable moves in the beginning, you will be fine, because there is so much more to worry about in the middle game!]
;B[dj];W[oc];B[pj];W[qh]TR[po][jp][np][jq]C[Actorios [8k\]: I believe it's not as good as Q10 but still worth it

BW - q10 is a good, big move by B, but i don't think you need to answer it - your shimari is secure, and a territory grab is small at this point.  i would look to the bigger points marked.]
;B[pn]
(;W[jc]C[Actorios [8k\]: Extension in front of his shimari to be... I feel like I'm too passive but I'm always afraid to play at shimari position (C15) and being chased against. Probably an incorrect feeling.

BW - it's hard for me to criticize your feeling.  that may just be your style!  however, you shouldn't be afraid of playing in the variations....]
;B[de];W[gc]C[Actorios [8k\]: This is too small I guess, compared to the bottom

BW - Yes];B[dm]C[BW - something to notice:  B is going for influence, you are going for territory!  your strategy at this point should be to have strong, non-attackable groups, so that B cannot profit from his attacks that are obviously on the way!]
;W[jp]LB[gp:B][fq:A][gq:C]TR[dm]C[Actorios [8k\]: I suppose this is incorrect.... the source of a difficult fight

BW - after B plays the marked stone, your corner is pressured, so a move around ABC seems better to me.]
;B[gp]
(;W[hq]C[Actorios [8k\]: Probably wrong logic, after move 17, I'm already running to the center... And I'm attacked as well in the corner

BW - no need to freak out and jump to the edge.  afterall, B's stone is just as unsettled as yours.  however, you do need to find a way to settle, connect, or run your groups out.  what about splitting B and returning the favor as in the variations?]
;B[fq]
(;W[dq]C[BW - you're being very passive.];B[lq]
(;W[gq]C[BW - this kind of move strengthens your opponent, and in this case, hurts your other group in the corner.  just jump out!]
;B[fp]C[BW - B is happy to connect.  do you see how this feels good for him?]
;W[io];B[jq];W[hp];B[gn];W[kp]C[BW:  this isn't bad locally, but have you forgotten about your corner group?  it is in trouble.]
;B[kq];W[lp]C[Actorios [8k\]: I tried to do a shoulder hit to force him into position... not sure it was correct but I felt ok at this stage]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[np];W[no];B[oo];W[km]TR[mo][no][lp]SQ[oo][mp]
[np]C[Actorios [8k\]: The shape looked good to me

BW:  yes your center group looks strong, but at the expense of some big territory to B in the corner.  i'm not sure if the marked exchanges helped you enough to offset the territory it gave B.]
;B[ln]C[B:  this seems unreasonable by B.]
(;W[lm]C[Actorios [8k\]: Was it the right answer ?];B[mn];W[nn]
;B[mm]C[Actorios [8k\]: I should have connected, here];W[om]

;B[qk];W[rk];B[pk]
(;W[rl];B[jn];W[kn];B[in];W[ko]C[BW: necessary];B[mk]
(;W[kk];B[ll];W[kl];B[lj];W[ji]C[BW: Whenever you play a knights move like this you have to expect it to be cut.  That's why it's considered an attacking move and not a defensive move.]
;B[kj];W[jj];B[jk]
(;W[ik]C[Actorios [8k\]: was this a correct answer ?]
(;B[il];W[jl];B[hl]TR[cn][co][er]C[BW:  I don't know what you're about to play next, but B just played a small point after letting you out in to the center, so your group is good.  Looking around, your corner is in danger, so I expect a play there.]

(;W[nj]C[Actorios [8k\]: This is maybe too deep. Maybe Q11 woul have been better

BW:  no reason to try and kill this group.  you are right that it is hassle able, so try to gain points that way.]

;W[je];B[cg]C[BW:  i can't see why B would go for territory.  it voilates the principle of "urgent points before big points".  in this case the lower left corner, ie. the life/death of your group, is the most urgent place for both of you.]

(;B[fn];W[hk];B[gj];W[gk];B[fj];W[gl]TR[eb][rn][so][ir]C[BW:  this is the kind of move that will keep you at 8kyu.  do you see how much smaller it is compared to the marked points?]
;B[hm];W[en];B[iq]TR[hn]
(;W[ip]C[Actorios [8k\]: Was there something better to play here... I was looking for tesuji but couldn't find any. Was the ko at F5 the best option?]
;B[em]TR[fm][hr]C[BW:  You are faced with the two points as miai.  Choose the lower one instead because then you will have sente to reduce the bottom.]

Many thanks in advance for your time...

BW:  3 main things to focus on:

1. If you are going to play a territory oriented game, be more mindful of your weak groups.  Your lower left corner could have been killed easily.
2. Attack to gain points, not to kill.  You could've directed a more controlled and profitable attack on B's center group.
3. Read a book on the endgame.
