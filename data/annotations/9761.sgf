(;B[kc]TR[ic]C[I can't say that this move is wrong, but a move at the triangle point would be a little more normal (see variation).]
;W[qf]
(;B[nc]TR[kc]SQ[nd]C[Here you've just created a very low position. Since your stone at L17 is already so close it's probably better to play this stone one space higher at O16.]
;W[qi];B[dj]TR[ic]SQ[op]C[This move, I had no idea where to place, what would have been a better place for it?


If you had a move at J17 like in the Chinese opening, this would be an excellent move. In the current position it's still okay, but I think an approach like P4 would be best.]
;W[cn];B[el]C[This move is too high. It looks like you're trying to develop the entire top side, but it's still quite open and easily invaded.]
;W[jp];B[jn]TR[lp]C[Same thing with this move. This move has another issue though in that you're basically inviting your opponent to take 4th line territory. If I was playing white in this situation I would consider responding to this move with a move like M4.]

(;W[df]LB[ce:1][cf:2][cg:3][ch:4][ci:5]TR[ec]C[I read that this approach is bad, but don't understand why. I would greatly appreciate an explanation.



In this position I think white's move is definitely less than ideal. White is playing right in your 5 space extension and your stone at D10 is flexible and strong.

White would have a much easier time invading on the top side where it is much more open. With an approach move like E17 white would have many options.

You should see this move as an opportunity. White just created a weak group inside your strong area. Now's your chance to attack it for profit!]

(;B[ec]TR[ed]C[This move is a little lax. You could apply much more pressure to the white stone by playing E16.]
;W[ce]C[This move by your opponent looks a little strange but I think that it's not too bad. When stones come into contact like this, the following moves generally result in both groups getting stronger. Since your corner enclosure is already quite strong, there's no harm in making it stronger and white's weak stone will hopefully gain some strength in the process.]

(;B[cg]TR[bd]C[This move is out for blood. You've deprived white of getting a base but you've left your corner weak which could come back to bite you later. A better alternative would have been to simply respond at B16.]

(;W[dd];B[dc];W[bd];B[cc]C[In the end white chose to use your weaknesses to get a few forcing moves and you got a pretty reasonable result. While I can't come up with an exact sequence, I think you got off pretty easy.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[bc];B[bb];W[dh];B[di];W[cl];B[bf];W[be]
(;B[ee]TR[dj][el][jn]C[This peep doesn't accomplish much because you're only threatening to take one stone. You should try attacking white on a larger scale and push him towards your influence in the middle.]
;W[cf]
(;B[de]TR[cf]C[White's move at C14 was slow and unnecessary but it was also sente. You took one stone (worth about 2 points) but now white can simply live by capturing your B14 stone.]
;W[bg]
(;B[ci]C[You're correct that you need to defend, but you could have defended in sente with the atari at B12.]
;W[ab];B[ca]TR[op]C[This move is quite small. Let white take the stone if he wants, there are bigger moves on the board. The approach at P4 is one of them.]
;W[nq]C[But instead your opponent got to play here first. :(]
;B[eg]C[This move is a little strange. While white's group isn't 100% alive it's still quite strong. If he wants White probably doesn't need to respond to this.

Another important thing to note is that white's group has many liberties and it's usually bad to attach to a group with more than 5 or so liberties. This is because your attaching stone only has 3 liberties so it will be at an inherent disadvantage in any ensuing fight.]
;W[ef]
(;B[ff]C[This move has the same liberty issues I mentioned before.]

(;B[hg]C[(see variation)];W[fe];B[gh];W[hh]
(;B[ig]C[This move should be spent saving your four stones instead of your one stone.]
;W[gi];B[ie]TR[ge][ff][gf][eg][eh][fh][gh]C[The destruction wrought by white herehas a lot to do with your stones' liberty shortages (and one missed atari). Now white has gained considerable influence in the center and in your area, but you haven't gained anything.

This move is no different. If white simply pushes through at J15, you won't be able to save every stone.

Also, if white wasn't alive before, he definitely is now after capturing 7 stones. It's impossible to attack a group that's already 100% alive.]
;W[if];B[jf];W[id];B[je];W[jg];B[ih];W[ii];B[hi]C[White made a mistake in letting you take a stone, but he can still capture some of your stones. Can you see it? Try to read it out yourself and then look at the variation.]

(;W[fi]C[This move lets you off the hook. Now you can save your stones.]
;B[hh];W[hj];B[jh];W[kg];B[ij];W[ik];B[ji];W[gk]C[As an unintended consequence of all this fighting, your group on the left is quite weak. Now's the time to save it!]
;B[jk];W[ek]
(;B[fk]C[There's no need to get fancy here. White's attempt to cut you at E9 actually doesn't work. (see var)]
;W[fl];B[fj];W[ej]C[You can actually use whites move here as an opportunity to break out.]

(;B[fm];W[dl];B[gl];W[dk]TR[cg][ch][ci][di][dj]C[The triangle stones are now dead. :(]
;B[il];W[gj]
(;B[fl]C[There's no reason to respond to white's move. You should take sente and play a larger move.]
;W[hl];B[hm];W[hk]
(;B[cm]TR[jl][im]C[This move runs into the same problems as before. While white only has 3 liberties, your stone only has 2 liberties.

Also, you have a cutting point that needs to be taken care of.]

(;W[im];B[jl];W[hn];B[gn];W[in];B[dm]C[White took advantage of your weaknesses and cut you into two groups. But since he failed to do so in sente you get a chance to follow up your attack.]
;W[bl];B[bm];W[am];B[an];W[al]LB[bk:1][bn:2]TR[ei][fi][gi][ej]
[gj][hj][dk][ek][gk][hk][ik][bl][cl][dl][hl][am]C[In the game I played 1, but immediately after thought I should have connected at 2. Would it have been possible for me to kill the triangle group?



You're correct that you should play at 2 here. If there's any hope of capturing white it will be lost if white gets to play 2.

Also, I don't think it's possible to capture the triangle stones. They only have 3 liberties, but your group on the inside also only has 3 liberties.]

;B[fo];W[gp];B[ip];W[en]TR[fj][fk][el][fl][gl][bm][cm][dm][em]
[fm][hm][gn][fo]C[Looks like white has made another large capture.]
;B[kf];W[lg];B[lf];W[mg];B[nf]TR[ie][je][jf][kf][lf]C[This move is a bit too thin. Since your stones only have 4 liberties you'll have a difficult time if you get cut.]

(;W[jo];B[iq];W[jq];B[jr];W[kr];B[kq];W[ir]C[At this point I resigned because I saw no way to come back into this game. Thank you for taking a look at my game :)


I think the most important thing to focus on right now is learning to recognize whether or not a group of stones is strong or weak. Your loss in this game was largely caused by trying to fight your opponent's strong stones with your own weak stones.

I would highly recommend getting your hands on a copy of Bruce Wilcox's "Contact Fights". It will walk you through important concepts like counting liberties (and why it matters) as well as some basic shape.

Also, if you haven't already, check out Nick Sibicky's Go Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/nicksibicky). He run's a Double-Digit Kyu class at the go center in Seattle and posts his lectures online. There's a lot of useful information to be found there.

I hope my review was helpful for you and good luck on your continued journey with go! :)]

(;B[ic]LB[dc:1][ec:2][fc:3][gc:4][hc:5]C[This opening is called the Chinese opening. The triangle stone is placed where it is because it creates a 5-space extension from the 3-4 stone at c16.

5-space extensions are important in the opening because it's the largest extension you can make where it's impossible for your opponent to create a comfortable base inside it.]
