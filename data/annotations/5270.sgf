;W[pp];B[cd];W[qf];B[nc]LB[nd:A][rd:B]C[[Broege: Personally I prefer to play at A - after White B (as in the game) it makes Black position slightly bigger.\]]
;W[rd]C[I'm never sure how to respond to this

[Broege: The variant shows a most common sequence, I think.\]]

(;B[qq]C[maybe an extension from O17 would've been better. . ?

[Broege: Usually Black protects the top-right corner first. Invading a 4-4 point early in the game is not recommended - White will get strong influence and Black will gain only a few points. Usually the invasion is executed only after White makes both extensions from its 4-4 point.\]]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[rq]LB[op:A]C[this kind of thre me cause he didn't do the joseki. . .

[Broege: I would recommend playing at A - lets White have more of the corner but moves up to the fourth line to create a greater influence.\]]
;B[rr]C[[Broege: This is too weak - White could completely shut Black in the corner - see the variants.\]]

(;W[sq];B[sr]LB[op:A][oq:C][sr:B]C[[Broege: This is a clear error - playing out yose moves so early in the game. Black should play at A instead - moving up and extending influence on the bottom.
Please think what White could do after A - clearly he would not play at B?
After Black played B White could sacrifice the two stones and play C - this would end just like the variants shown two moves ago.\]]
;W[ro];B[nq]LB[op:A]C[I wasn't sure whether to respond to W-S3 with B-S2, or just extend like O3 straightaway and so on. . .still not sure. . .seems like I could've saved S2 to regain sente in middle game. . .

[Broege: As in the previous comments - I would recommend playing A first.\]]
;W[dj]LB[qj:A]C[should've I have done D10 instead of either S2 or O3 or both?

[Broege: Not necessarily. You can't have all the board for yourself :)
Seriously though - there is still much empty space left on the edges - if you protect in one spot White will simply play the other.
I would rather aim at playing somewhere around A as White can try to quickly close the whole side.\]]
;B[jp];W[fp]
(;B[en]LB[cn:A]C[I think this was a pretty slick move on my part = )

[Broege: This seems a bit too agressive. Black escapes into the center while he should protect the corner and then attack White. This move also creates a weakness around A - Black can be easily cut from the edge.
White is already in some trouble - he played between a strong group in the bottom-right and a 4-4 stone. Black should try to gain more strength in the corner and then attack.
See the variants for some calmer Black responses.\]];W[gn];B[fr]
LB[cn:B][eq:A][hq:D][er:C]TR[dp]C[also pretty slick, I think. . .

[Broege: Again, this move leaves a big weakness at A while maintaing weaknes at B.
If you want to put some pressure on White you can play much calmer - at A, C or (perhaps best) D. White will still have to escape and your own groups will be stronger - thus less prone to an attack later on.
In general - try to make your stones connected (the triangled stones are not).\]]
;W[fq];B[eq]LB[dq:C][eq:D][hq:B][er:A]TR[fr]C[should I have done G3 instead? seems like I'm pushing him toward my weakness with E3. . .

[Broege: I think A would be best - it makes the triangled stone immune to attack from the left and from a cut at C or D.
This problem is a direct consequence of playing too aggresively a move earlier. After exchanging the triangles stone for B there is no such problem.\]]
;W[gr];B[fs]LB[er:A]C[[Broege: Again, you have a tendence to play out yose moves. Why not simply connect at A? Then it's White who should think about protecting cuts, not Black.\]]
;W[gs];B[dr];W[iq];B[cl]LB[oj:D][qj:E][dl:B][dm:C][jq:A]C[maybe P10 would've been better. . .

[Broege: One should finish what one began - how about pressuring White with A?

If you choose to play on the left side - why not B? White cannot easily dive beneath (as the White stone is on the fourht line) and there is no weakness at C.

As for the right side - playing at D will give you nothing - White will gladly play at E loosely connecting both his right-side groups. You will actually force White to strengthen his side.
If your strategy is to do something on the right side - play E and make a fight.\]]

[rs][ss]C[[Broege: A short summary now:
Your strategic intuition is quite OK. Of course it can be better - but that can be said of almost anyone :)
I think that the biggest strategic problem is that you often choose to play small, yose-like moves instead of going after big ones (like invading a potential territory or extending your own frameworks).
Another problem is tactical value of the moves chosen - when the strategical choice was correct quite a number of moves are not making their work properly - e.g. are too weak and connected to your own groups.
I would recommend trying to play more calmly, with less aggresion and/or greed. Best to play such games with a friend and talk them over as you play. In this way you will be able to see how a stronger player may punish tactical overplays.
The last thing - yose. You make an error of many a weaker player (including myself) of finishing local situations instead of searching for biggest moves. Try to estimate where the biggest moves are at least once in a few moves and you will play much better.
