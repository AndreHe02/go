(;B[ef]C[Zander: White is nearly certain to reply with F4, after which D4, F3 are likely, as in the game. The result is not great for Black, as White connects all his stones well and threatens G3. If Black plays F4 instead, I think he manages to cut White and ends up in the better position.]
;W[ff];B[df];W[fg];B[gd]C[Zander: So far Black is being very aggressive, playing one stone in each corner. In a 9x9 game it is unrealistic to try to take all four corners. Black should be thinking about trying to connect the loose stones into stronger groups.]

(;B[dg]C[Zander: This is inefficient. The 3 black stones had four liberties, and so does this shape with 4 stones. A jump, e.g. at D2, is better for claiming the corner.]
;W[be]
(;B[gf]C[Zander: I don't think Black can save the stone at G3. White will take the lower right for about 16 points. If Black can live in the lower left and claim the top, then the game is still close.]
;W[eh]C[Zander: Unfortunately, after this I think Black will always lose both groups at the bottom.]

[ii]C[Zander: The 9x9 board is so small that there's not really enough room for either player to make more than two living groups in a game. By the time each player has played about 8-10 stones it will already be the "endgame" phase; the players should figure out who will claim each part of the board, settle the groups that will live and, if necessary, abandon any that will not. Black continued trying to develop three separate groups throughout the game, but on the small board there is not enough space or time for that.]
)
(;B[dh]C[Zander: Since White has a good attack from either side, Black can't save the group at D4.]
