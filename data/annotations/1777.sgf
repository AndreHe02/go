Can you pls comment on some of
the dan level moves of W, big mistakes I did and areas of improvement?

Thank you..

Hi Arcin,

this game was a bit difficult to comment on as white played very strange in the beginning.  The reason you got yourself in a lost position towards the end was maybe more due to psychology than playing ability...

Please feel free to mail me if you have more questions,

/Erik];W[fq]C[pressman [?\]: hew
pressman [?\]: too hard
arcin [13k?\]: hope you will enjoy the game];B[dn];W[mp];B[oq]
C[pressman [?\]: are you an american?];W[dl]C[arcin [13k?\]: no]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[hq]C[pressman [?\]: too mant stones];W[hr]C[arcin [13k?\]: you are 7d
arcin [13k?\]: come on.];B[ir]C[pressman [?\]: it has been long time to play 9-stone go]
;W[hp];B[iq];W[cj];B[cl];W[ck]C[arcin [13k?\]: you'll sharpen your skills :)]
;B[cm];W[dk];B[cf]C[Erik: C14 is good, but maybe you should take the opportunity to play F6 and launch the attack at once.]
;W[nc];B[fn]C[Erik: Very good! White has terrible shape here and can't really afford to play O17.]
;W[gn];B[fm];W[cq]C[Erik: This can't work well...];B[dr]C[Erik: E2 is probably better here. Let white life in the corner if he likes :)]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[fs];B[er];W[gq];B[fo];W[go];B[io]C[pressman [?\]: you're not 13k

Erik:  A bit too close for my taste. Your goal shouldn't be to kill the group, but to hunt the group and take points elsewhere. If it dies it's just a bonus :)]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[hk]C[arcin [13k?\]: i am also new to this server.
arcin [13k?\]: the question mark next to my name says my rank is not established yet.
pressman [?\]: you too good

Erik: White tries to beat you psychologically?];B[fk];W[hi]
C[arcin [13k?\]: you should be able to beat me.
arcin [13k?\]: there is definitely 9 stone difference between us if you are 7d]
;B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[dg];B[hj]C[arcin [13k?\]: would be glad to hear more, but what can you do ? :)
pressman [?\]: h10 is too early
arcin [13k?\]: you're still here, good.

Erik: Unnecessary to play that aggressively. Just countinue the splitting attack!]
;W[ij];B[ik];W[gj];B[hl];W[gl];B[il];W[gm];B[gk]C[Erik: Very risky.]
;W[fl];B[el];W[co];B[do];W[ek];B[em];W[bn];B[bp]C[pressman [?\]: b4 is mistake]
;W[cp]
(;B[bl];W[cr];B[cs];W[bs];B[br];W[ds];B[es];W[dm]C[arcin [13k?\]: what should the answer be???

Erik: C6 seems to work well.]
(;B[cs]
(;W[bq]C[Erik: White is kind here :)];B[as];W[aq];B[ep]C[Erik: Good.]
;W[gs]C[Erik: ??? This is desperate.];B[cn];W[ji];B[kj];W[gh]
;B[hj];W[eo];B[en];W[hk];B[gi];W[hj];B[hh];W[ii];B[fh];W[gg]
;B[fg];W[ff];B[gf];W[hg];B[ef];W[fe];B[eg];W[ki];B[nd]C[Erik: M10 is much more important. Another stone at Q6 and lower right is almost sure territory.

D1 and C13 are also good, killing the groups.];W[jn];B[in];W[im]
;B[jl];W[kn];B[lj];W[kr];B[ho];W[cg];B[bf];W[rp]C[Erik: The game is clearly won by black in this situation. White has not one single live stone yet. Just keep calm and everything will go well :)]
;B[mr]C[Erik: What is the purpose for this move?

Play simple moves! R5 or Q6, for example, keeps black well connected and white separated.]
;W[kp];B[ip];W[qq]C[pressman [?\]: die hard];B[lq];W[kq];B[qr]
C[Erik: Oh dear. Bloodthirsty? Just play Q6, stay connected and white will struggle hard.]
;W[rr];B[qp];W[pr];B[pq];W[qs];B[ro]C[Erik: Why? The corner group is already alive. Attack the L4 group instead.]
;W[qn];B[rn];W[qm]C[Erik: Did you have time problems here? You seem to have lost the whole board view in this sequence. What was your plan?   You can still play P6 and stay connected. Don't get shut in!]
;B[sp];W[rq];B[or]C[Erik: You must out!!
Even tenuki is better than this move :)];W[no];B[pn]C[Erik: Too late now...]

(;B[nb]C[Erik: Hmm, killing mentality again...];W[oc];B[ob]

;W[fc];B[gd];W[eb];B[fd];W[rj]
(;B[rk]C[Erik:  Play simple moves that work instead :)
The K12 group is not yet alive, get some thickness and kill it if white doesn't defend!]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[qk];B[ok];W[oo];B[ml]C[Erik: Why? The O8 stone is a very unimportant now.]
;W[qf];B[qc];W[ar]C[Erik: So white managed to save both the half dead groups at the left...]
;B[ds];W[bs];B[db];W[rd];B[rc];W[bd];B[ai];W[bi];B[aj];W[ah]
;B[bh]C[Erik: Overplay.];W[ak];B[di];W[ch];B[ag];W[bj]C[Muttley [4k\]: white fights hard]
;B[al];W[ah];B[dh]C[arcin [13k?\]: played this part very bad :(

Erik: Never let it end in gote!!];W[qh]C[arcin [13k?\]: guess could have been betyter]
;B[re];W[qe];B[qd];W[rf];B[ec];W[fb];B[kb];W[ka];B[ke]C[Erik: Very small.]
;W[se];B[kb];W[kc];B[ib];W[ia];B[sc];W[pb];B[pc];W[na];B[od]
;W[oa];B[qb];W[ma];B[nh];W[mh];B[ni]C[Erik: White is safely ahead now.   From your play at the beginning, I'm sure you will get several stones stronger if you just can keep yourself calm and concentrated during the whole game. Especially when you are so much ahead, you should try to make the game simple.    This was the last comments. I hope they are useful for you.
