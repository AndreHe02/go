C[I won, and I do not know how.

This game seemed to be going the way I wanted it to, until I lost a semeai that probably should have gone in my favor. My spirit broken, I tried to do whatever I could to reduce my opponent where I could, and failed in the process. Even by my post-game counting, he should have been ahead, so I don't understand how I managed to come back.

I have some specific questions throughout the file, but whatever insights you have regarding positional judgment, board counts, and move choices will be most appreciated.

MR: I tried to answer most of the questions you put in the game record. 
I agree that you threw away the game in the semeai in the upper right. 
It seems that your opponent was not aware of the fact that the game got rather close again - so he threw it away by lousy endgame. 

My main point to your game is that you switched strategy several times in the opening and early middle game. By this, some of your stones looked "strange" some moves later - like the white wall in the lower left and the white stones around E10 that first planned to kill the black group. 
Of course, you should not stick to strategies that do not work. But maybe you can try to choose strategies that fit with the rest of your stones in the first place (I know that this is difficult ;-) ). 

With respect to playing against influence oriented strategies of your opponent, I would like to suggest to you a) to play more lightly in enemy's sphere of influence (see the group on the upper right side) and b) to deal with the moyo early (like a capping move on the right side). 

With respect to counting, I am not an expert on this - I just make broad estimates in my own games. So maybe you need to ask somebody else with respect to counting questions ...]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[qi]C[I hate the Chinese opening, low or high. I hate san-ren-sei, too. I do not seem to grok how to play effectively against influence-aimed styles that simultaneously surround territory.

Any tips you have on how to respond strategically to the Chinese opening would be greatly appreciated.

MR: If you really hate Chinese Opening, you should not start in the opposite corner with move 2 ;-) You can simply hinder your opponent to play Chinese Opening (or San Ren Sei) then ... However, the better way is, of course, to learn to cope with influence oriented strategies of your opponent. There is a book "The Chinese Opening" - maybe buy and read it ;-)]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo];W[pe]C[MR: Normal opening until now. However, instead of Q15 I would have played some type of cap to B R11 - I think you could think of Q10 or P11.]
;B[pd]C[I've never seen this move before, and thus am not sure how to respond to it, let alone how to get a decent result. I went with what felt right, but I wonder if I could have done better?

MR: My feeling is that this move is wrong direction for black. I would prefer B P11.

To be honest, I never encountered this black move either, and your continuation R15 seems natural to me.]
;W[qe];B[rd]
(;W[kc]C[It seemed to me that I was not going to profit much from my two stones, but they seemed hard to kill, so I decided to limit an extension from black's corner.

Thoughts?

MR: You mentioned in the beginning that you hate influence oriented strategies by your opponents. Leaving weak stones in your opponents sphere of influence makes it easier for your opponent to utilize his influence strategy. Even when your stones can't be killed, black can chase them around and build territory on the lower right side by doing so.

L17 is probably large but not urgent.]
(;B[mc]C[MR: Taking the smaller of two points in the same area is usually not a good idea. Answering L17 seems to be slow. Black should punish whites tenuki with P15.]
;W[dj]C[Just to be fair, I hate using the san-ren-sei as much as I hate playing against it. It never seems to go so well for me, but nothing else felt right here. Did I have any other reasonable choices?

MR: D10 is in line with your strategy started with L17. Still, playing a capping move like P11 seems more urgent to me.]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[cf]C[I felt that Black was not free to tenuki this way, but I don't think I got a sufficient result for my efforts. Was Black fine to tenuki here (meaning my pincer was ill-advised), did I misplay somehow, or am I not evaluating the outcome correctly?

MR: You are right that black usually should not exchange D2 for C3 if he wants to take sente in the lower left. However, it might not be necessary to punish black's tenuki directly, as the lower left corner might not be the "hot spot" of the game anyway. I feel that answering in the upper left corner is more urgent in order to keep a meaning for L17.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[ip];B[iq];W[gp];B[gq];W[ho];B[hr]C[MR: This is one possible variation. White's advantages are that he gets sente to continue in the upper left corner. Also, K3 is left for later.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[bj]
(;W[bh]C[MR: You need not play that aggressive here. Why not simply take the territory with C10 as shown in the variation?]

;B[cj]C[MR: Now the variation around G4 does not work very well for white anymore ...]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[ej];B[ei];W[fj];B[fi];W[gj];B[ck]
(;W[gg]CR[bl]C[Could I have dropped down to B8 (marked), or is this move necessary to secure the death of the three stones?

MR: B8 seems possible to me since black cannot afford to move with his three stones around B14 directly because of his weak stones around D11. B8 is also the logical continuation to the moves E10 to G10 which all look for killing the black group (or at least for making it very hard for that group to live). 
However, in a difficult fight, one misplacement can easily turn the table and revitalize stones thought to be dead ...]
;B[bl];W[ke]C[MR: The move fits well to G13. However, E10 to G10 look strange now. And so do the other white stones in the lower left ... (as already mentioned earlier)]

(;W[pg]C[MR: Play more lightly in enemy's sphere of influence! 
You build yourself a heavy group and make it easy for your opponent to chase it around and build territory on the way.]

MR: This move is a defence-only move. I do not see how your white corner can be killed as long as you capture B14 etc. 
You could also think of cutting through with G12 which threatens to capture the J12 stones and by this to solve any problems for the K15 group.]

C[As far as I can tell, this should have been the losing move. I was worried about the shortage of liberties that playing L11 (marked) might lead to, but in the end, it proved to be the liberty I was short in the race.

After this, was there some way I could have won the semeai?

MR: I do not see one - but I am not an expert in semeais or ko creation ...]
;B[rf];W[jf];B[se];W[lb];B[qf];W[ld];B[of];W[na]C[I was trying to make a two-step ko, but I gave up on it when I saw I had no threats.]
;B[ma];W[la];B[pa]C[I didn't count during the game, but I have tried counting now to see if I should have resigned after losing my dragon.

Black: 78 guaranteed points + 5 captures = 83 points
White: 67 guaranteed points + 3 captures + 6.5 komi = 76.5 points

I'm not sure how to account for the probable territory Black has on the bottom, but I figure that White's lower-left group balances it territorially. This means that I am behind unless I can reduce Black's framework in the middle-right and can secure points in the bottom-left and center.

Could you please show me how you would count this board, and whether I made the correct decision with my next move?

MR: My counting also comes to the conclusion that you are behind in territory.
The best thing to do is to reduce the black territory on the right as far as possible and to create some trouble for black. You have the option of creating a large ko with J2.  There are some ko threats against the left side group starting with C7. Of course, not playing the semeai at the top to that extend would have left some more ko threats for you ...]
(;W[ml];B[ll];W[lk];B[mk];W[lm];B[kl];W[km];B[mm];W[nl]C[I was desperate to try to make something live here so that Black's side would be diminished.

MR: As you are behind that should be your strategy now ...]

C[I misread here. When I had played O5, I was aiming for N4, but when the time came to play it I misread the continuation and determined that I would lose my stones by playing there.

MR: I do not see much sense in causing even more trouble with N4.]
;B[mp];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[ol]
(;W[mj]C[MR: Too small. Just now the clamp S6 works (it does not work later when you come to play in that area as at that time the stones around O6 are already captured).]
;B[nk];W[cm]C[MR: It seems that both sides do not see the ko aji on the lower side.

;W[bn];B[ak];W[am];B[ai];W[cr]C[MR: In what follows, you get most of the large endgame moves. Maybe your opponent ran out of time as he plays dame moves in the end while there are still points available?]
