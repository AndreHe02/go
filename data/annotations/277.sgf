;B[dj]C[The opening is  pretty well played by black.];W[jd];B[qn];W[nq]
;B[rp];W[qq];B[qk]C[R9 is too conservative.  Q10 is better I think for two reasons. 1.)  R9 is too close to R6. Better to play at R10 or Q10.  2.) In the opening you  should alternate play on the 3rd and 4th line.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[qi];B[rq]C[This is too slow.   This group is
in no immediate danger, and there
are bigger points  on the board. Particularly around H17.];W[lc];B[qd];W
[of];B[gc]C[Good move. I think you can go one  over to h17.];W[cf]C[Look at the variation for the standard response  to this.]

(;B[cd];W[ci];B[di]C[A beter play is C10.  White is very
narrow, and will have to work to make two eyes. This way you leave your  underside (The area around B9) open to attack.]
;W[cj];B[ch]C[C9 is better.];W[bh];B[cg]C[This is a bad move. It is like "banging your  head against a wall."
You can not prevent white from connecting, so it is unclear what the purpose  is.]
;W[bg];B[df];W[ce];B[de];W[kp]C[This is a  good play by white.  White has a large lead at this point.]
;B[ck];W[hc];B[hd];W[ic];B[he]C[This is pretty good  play.];W[ho];B[ld]
C[This is a wasted move.  By attaching you  will only make white
stronger.  Better move is to play at the bottom, I think.];W[kd];B[md];W
[on]C[At this point I think black should jump out to  P9, or F7 area.  The bottom area by white is huge, and  is threatening to expand.]

;W[cq];B[fp];W[gp];B[nl]C[I think with all your black stones on  the outside you don't have to be so timid.  K8 or even M6  is a good reducing  move.]

(;B[ce];W[df];B[ch]C[Blacks  position is great.  White's weak group is surronded on two sides by black.   White would probably not play D14 because of this. He might  go down the side, but you should have
no problem with him, or jump out, which is also ok.]))
