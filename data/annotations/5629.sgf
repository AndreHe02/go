;B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[jc]MA[je]C[[zombek\]I didn't really know what to do. Should I have play something like K15 to strengthen the corners and squeze W to the border or is the move I made ok?

>D16 is perfectly OK.  Always best to stake out the corners when you can.  (In this respect W's k17 is wrong; should have been around Q4.)  

>But K15 would not have been good and would not strengthen the corners.  That move is too "high", meaning too far from the edge.]
;B[qp]C[>Too "low" (close to edge).  Q4 would have been better.  Now W can easily invade around P3 and B's territory will be smaller. You can see for yourself how much bigger B would be playing Q4. As a general rule it is not good to be low in two neighboring corners (R16 and R4).]
;W[jq];B[dj]C[>P17 better here.  Your D16 corner is safe for the time being.]
;W[qj];B[oj]MA[oc]C[>Not good.  I would favor P17, mainly to prevent W from playing there.  Remember this maxim: "Opponent's best move is usually my best move."

Another possibility would be R14.  Can you see why this is not as good?  (That's right!  It is too low.)

Your P10 attempts to contain W's R10 stone.   This is wrong for three reasons.  (1) it does not strengthen or support your corner stones; (2) white will manage to live anyhow; (3) you are helping W to make territory on the edge where it is easier to live than in the center.]
;W[qg];B[ql];W[pi];B[oi]C[[zombek\] I didn't really know how to play to decrese the amount of theritory W gained, in the end W gets the right corner.

>See previous comment.  Once you're in this position, it's better to let W play on the edge and focus your attention on P17,]
;W[ph];B[pf]MA[oc]C[>This Q15 stone is not strong.  W can just sneak underneath, making territory AND threatening R16 (doing two things at once), which is exactly what happens.  You must play P17 instead.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qe];B[pe]C[>The only thing this move does is help the Q14 stone, which is wasted anyway.  Don't worry about saving that stone.  Worry about saving the corner.]
;W[pd];B[qf]MA[cq][fq][pc]C[[zombek\] I don't think R14 was a good move, but I couldn't find any alternatives.

>With Q17 you attack W and can probably live.  If W is smart he won't even bother answering this move; he will let you have the corner and reinforce his [only\] corner with F3.  If he fails to do this you can invade at C3 and W may have no corners!

>Please play this out on your board.  It is very instructive. B is already far ahead of W.]
;W[rf];B[od]MA[pc]C[>Attacking from wrong side; Q17 is better.]
;W[pc]C[>Now W cannot be stopped.  He will win the corner.]
;B[oc]C[>This is a good defensive move if you are able to follow it up properly.  If W could play here he would win the top edge as well as the corner.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[rb];B[qb];W[pb];B[sb];W[qa];B[ob];W[sd];B[oa]
C[>M17 to stake out territory would be better.];W[sc]C[>Note that W does not have to make this move; he can kill B's stones at any later time if he needs to.  W should play something like F3 instead.]
;B[og]LB[oh:A]MA[qf][pf][pe]C[>This move is not solid.   Later (by playing at A, for example) it is too easy for W to break through into the center by engineering a double atari on O13 and the 3 marked stones.

Better ideas are P13 to secure your corner or C6 to expand along the left side and force W to defend his corner.]
;W[fc];B[cf]C[>I prefer E17.  Otherwise, W is free to jump into C18 and ruin your corner territory (but he doesn't see this yet).]
;W[fe];B[db];W[gp];B[lc]C[>This is an important point.  But you also have the possibility (if not now, maybe later) to invade W's corner at C3.  Once W plays another stone in that corner it will be impossible for you to invade there.]
;W[je];B[le];W[cm];B[kg]C[>Good!  I like this move a lot!];W[fg]
;B[bk]TR[lm][lo][lq]MA[oq][dh]C[>Not really strong enough.   D12 would be better, if only to prevent W from playing there.  But I think P3 is best.  If you play there and W does not respond locally, you can push to M3 and then try, from there, to push into the center.  If you can succeed that will remedy your low position in the corner.  You should play this out on your board to see what happens.  Basically, if you can play at or around the three triangles (M3, M5, M7) you will have a huge territory in the lower right AND good support from three sides for moving into the center.]
;W[mq];B[jg]MA[oq]C[>This move is what we call "too slow".  It is a solid, mainly defensive move that doesn't accomplish enough.  Instead, you would play P3 now to hold your corner.]
;W[jf];B[ih];W[hg];B[ig]LB[jh:A]MA[jj][hh]C[>This move, while not creating an immediate danger, is inherently bad because it makes what is called an "empty triangle" around point A.  That is a notoriously inefficient shape (do a Google search or consult go books to learn why).  Only very rarely is an empty triangle a good move.  

You should play instead at H12 or perhaps K10.];W[if];B[kf]
MA[ij][jj][jk][ik][hh]C[>Another slow move.  If W plays here on his next move, you can easily stop him.  So you should find a better place to play. H12 is obvious, but also slow.  Any of the marked intersections around K10 would be good; of these I like J10 the best.  

BUT... you must play at P3 before W does!];W[gi];B[hh]MA[ij]
C[>I'm not going to mention P3 again, although that's where you should play.   Aside from that, J10 would be good.]
;W[gg]MA[gh]C[>W should have played at G12.];B[gh];W[fh];B[hi]
MA[fi]C[>Too defensive!  Better to attack W at F11.];W[fj];B[dh]
C[[zombek\] I could play G10 instead of strengthening the left side, that would probably gave me a better result in the end or maybe play somewhere else?]
;W[hj];B[ij];W[hk];B[ik];W[hl];B[il];W[el];B[ol]LB[ok:A][pl:B]
MA[pk][in]C[>B and W have played well these last several moves.  But I don't like 73.  J6 is much stronger.  

73 does not make a good shape.  The reason is that W can later play at Q9, threatening to cut at P9 or Q8.  If you block one of these, he will take the other.  If you wanted to defend here, you should have played at Q9 instead of P8.  But J6 is much stronger.

And do you know another strong move?  Yes, it is the same P3 that I don't mention anymore!]
;W[im];B[jm];W[in];B[km]MA[jn]C[>You should extend down to K6, not across.  This move is only reducing your own potential territory.]
;W[ko]C[>W has a good response.];B[kn]LB[jn:A]MA[mn]C[>Do you see why this is bad?   First, it is slow.  Second, it makes a tight little clump of stones, none of which are doing enough work either to attack W or to make territory.  Third, it makes the empty triangle shape around the point marked A. You need to play N6 instead.]
;W[jo]C[>Fortunately W is not a strong player either!];B[mn]
C[>Perfect!];W[mo];B[nn];W[op]MA[pr][pn][po][pq]C[>This is a well-played stone for W.  From here W has the possibility to play Q3, Q5, Q6 and perhaps Q2.  Any of those moves will significantly reduce B's territory.  Some could even threaten to kill B in the corner if you do not properly respond.]
;B[no]MA[po]C[>This is slow and also a very small threat.  If you played Q5 you would defend more points than you can possibly win by attacking W in this manner.]
;W[np];B[lo]C[>Same comment.];W[mp];B[lp];W[lq];B[kp];W[kq]
;B[ln];W[jp];B[rk]MA[po]C[>This is good but not urgent.  The concept of "urgent" moves is important in go.  Here your urgent move is something like Q5.  W would respond Q3, you would play R3, and your corner would be secure.]
;W[rj];B[sk];W[sj];B[oo];W[pq];B[pp]MA[qq]C[>Should be at R3.  Play it out this way on your board and count the difference in territory!]
;W[qq]MA[ga][an][cq]C[>W knows the maxim: "Opponent's move is usually my best move." You didn't exploit it, so he played there.

At this point W is in the lead and will probably win.  What are you going to do about it?  One possibility is  to invade at C3. Another is to monkey-jump to A6 or G19.  And there are probably others...]
;B[rq]MA[rp]C[>Better to exend straight here (S3).];W[rr];B[sp]
;W[sr];B[qo]MA[rp]C[>Bad: (1) empty triangle, (2) just reduces your own territory, (3) if W plays T3 you have to defend at S3, reducing your territory even more.

You should simply play S3 instead -- OR find a sente move (take initiative, to which opponent must respond) elsewhere on the board.]
;W[or]C[>Unnecessary for W.];B[kb];W[jb];B[kd];W[jd];B[ka];W[ja]
MA[sk][rk][qk][ka][kb][kc]C[>Be alert to a weakness at L3.  If W plays there, you must protect your two marked stones.  The same situation exists at R9.  This is a fairly common threat and you should learn to recognize it.

Instead of your next move, see variation for how the monkey jump can work.]

(;B[bl];W[bm];B[cl]MA[dl]C[>Another empty triangle.  You could play at D8 instead, where W make his next move.]
;W[dl];B[dk];W[cq]MA[cm][bm]C[>I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think this move is necessary for W at this point.  Because of the marked stones, W's corner is quite safe.]
;B[ef]MA[fa][am]C[>Not bad, but F19 would be better.  A7 is another possibility, but you'll probably have chances to play that later.]
;W[ei];B[di];W[ff];B[ee]LB[de:A]C[>This move saves only one point of territory, the one marked A.]
;W[ec];B[dc];W[ed];B[df]MA[ga]C[>Purely defensive and not necessary.  I like the monkey jump to G19 better.]
;W[eb];B[ea];W[fa];B[da];W[kc];B[lb];W[ke];B[ld];W[oh]C[[zombek\] Leaving these stones here unconnected was probably quite a big mistake. W just exploited my weakness and made me lose a few points.

>Yes, and you could have seen this coming 100 moves ago (see comment at move 38).  But your response to W was pretty good.]
;B[nh];W[pk];B[ok];W[pl];B[pm];W[qk];B[rm];W[pg];B[nf];W[am]
C[>If you had managed to keep sente (initiative), you could have played here (only worth ~3 points).]
;B[ni]MA[ek][eg][sq][al]C[>By now B has clearly lost, so this is a small tactical point. Your move 149 was not necessary and therefore cost you at least two points: one because it fills your territory and another (such as A8, E13 or T3) where you could have made territory; E9, which reduces W's territory.]
;W[al];B[ak];W[ek];B[eh]MA[eg]C[>This cost you a point (should be at E13).]

(;W[ej]C[>W can afford to be conservative here.  Otherwise, W could push into E13 and let you play at E10.  Then W would push again to D13 and start a ko fight.

See the variation for one possible outcome.  It is worth a few more points for W.]
;B[eg];W[sq];B[rp];W[pj];B[tt]C[>Final comments.  When you play through the game again, you will see that B could have won by:

1. Keeping W out of the R4 and R16 corners.  That, I think, was the major mistake.  

2. Making generally faster, more aggressive moves in the center.

3. Invading or reducing W's D4 corner when it was possible to do so.

4. Making at least one of the monkey-jump moves suggested, which would have been worth 10 points.

Small mistakes in tactics (e.g., empty triangles) are easy to correct for future games.  However, they're not big enough to account for any difference in this game.  W made plenty of mistakes and misjudgements as well (the biggest one was leaving you potentially three corners early in the game), but I focused my comments mainly on B.]
