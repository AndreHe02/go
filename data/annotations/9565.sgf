C[Question of Black player noitcif:

I was black and I won this game, but I'd like to know why I won it only so closely, even though I captured a lot of stones. Just because of the mistake early in the game, or were there other reasons aswell!?

$ Hi, I'm Stefan. I'll prepend my comments with a '$'.];B[dp]
;W[pd];B[pq];W[cd];B[ed];W[df];B[hd];W[cj];B[bf]C[$ Black can't expect to make a group live here.]
;W[cg];B[ce];W[de];B[dd];W[be]
(;B[cf]C[$ No way to live here. I have added a variation where Black at least can gain a little on the outside.]
;W[bg];B[af]C[c14 and a14 are unnecessary?

$ Yes. Note that White can always reduce Blacks liberties to one so Black never has time to play e.g. B16.]
;W[ag];B[bd]C[c17 better?

$ Both seems to accomplish the same here. No big difference IMO.]
;W[ae];B[cc];W[ce]C[$ White should not answer here but take sente elsewhere.]
;B[bc]C[$ Same for Black - saving one stone is small. We're still in opening!]
;W[cm]C[$ Not necessary. White's group is already alive. Better to approach lower right corner.]
;B[co]C[$ This is OK but looks a bit small. I would have approached the top left corner.]
;W[fq];B[fo]C[$ Good. There's not that much territory in the corner so it's usually better to come out into the center and put some pressure on F3.]
;W[iq];B[dr]C[$ I think it's too early to already defend territory here.]
;W[lq]C[$ White plays VERY solid. N4 or approaching the corner from the left side (Q5) looks more active.]
;B[qf]C[$ Good!];W[nc]
(;B[qj]C[$ This is too far from R14 as White can invade at R12, and rather small scale and a low position. Better play either the the usual exchange (see variation) to build a solid base, or play more large-scale at Q10 or Q9, trying to build a territorial framework on the right.]
;W[kc]C[$ As White I would have gone for Q5 or so. The corner is not in danger at the moment.]
;B[rd]C[$ Afterwards White can still invade at R12. R10 looks misplaced. You can leave this out as it neither makes a lot of territory, nor secures the group as a whole, and you lose the possibility to invade at R17 later.]
;W[qc];B[ic]C[$ Too small. Q6 looks promising.];W[qo]C[$ White hits the weak spot - Q3 is very weak.]
;B[qm];W[qq]
(;B[op]C[$ Odd. See variations for something different. It's hard to see something really good for Black here.]
;W[on]C[$ Now the followup is clear - You have committed yourself to defending Q3, and White takes profit by chasing your group. This is painful, maybe abandoning the stone (and keeping the aji for later) would have been better.]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[mo];W[mm]C[$ White is too thin now. See variations for how Black can try to cut.]

(;B[ln];W[nq];B[np]C[$ Better connect at P5 - this might be helpful at a later attempt to break through around Q6 later]

(;W[oq]C[$ Too daring. See variations for something better]
;B[pp];W[pr]C[$ White is really stretching its position here. N3 is the glaring hole here.]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[qp];W[nr];B[qr];W[rq];B[rp]C[$ Good comeback from Black. White has overstretched its position and now N7/P6/R5 are weak and almost captured.]
;W[rr]MA[ao][bo][dq][ds][fd][gd][ib][ia][sd][re][qg][qh][qi]
[qk][ql][rm][sm][ac]SQ[kb][ka][lc][mc][oc][qb][qa][gq][hq][jq]
[kq][fr][fs][sr][bm][am][cl][ck][ci][ch]C[$ A quick count:

Black:
Top left ~20
Right ~15
Bottom left ~12
= ~47

White:
Left ~13
Top ~10
Bottom ~20
Captured ~5
Komi 6.5
= ~55

So White seems ahead but Black has good prospects (weak White stones P6 etc.)]

(;B[ro]C[$ Better attack more firmly. I think P8 would be good. This a) threarens to cut P6/R5 and b) develops the area around P10. See variation]
;W[pn];B[io]C[$ You should continue the attack on the weak White stones.]
;W[gf]C[$ Bad. What does White want to accomplish?];B[if]C[$ Better stop White from developing on the left. E7]
;W[fm];B[kf]C[$ You let White gain big on the left. What's the point here?]
;W[im];B[lm]C[$ Good. Keep attacking here.];W[ll];B[ml]C[$ Good!]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[nk];B[lk]C[$ N10 is even better here];W[kl];B[jj]
C[$ Dangerous. If White plays O10 he's back in the game. Keep attacking! Best to play O7 to connect out.]
;W[hj]C[$ White wants to keep territory but again his shape is thin. Black can reduce via e.g. G12]
;B[kk]C[$ I still like N10 better here];W[jl]C[$ Bad. No need for White to keep these two stones. O11 to keep fighting]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[il];W[hl]C[$ This sequence was good for White as his center left territory is more solid now.]
;B[jm]
(;W[km]C[$ These stones are dead - better play somewhere else]
;B[jn]C[$ ... and forces Black to a better position.];W[hh]

[gm][em][dm][bm][am][fr][fs][gq][hq][jq][kq][sr]C[$ Good result for White - no more obvious weaknesses here.

At this point I would count (very roughly):
Black:
Top left ~20
Right ~20
Center ~ 10
Bottom left ~10
Captured 10
= ~70

White:
Top right ~12
Left ~45
Bottom ~20
Captured 4
Komi 6.5 = ~85

So Black is ~15 points behind but has much better prospects as he is much stronger in the center right area which is still to be played out.]
;B[jh]C[$ Dangerous. Whites O8 group is not 100% dead.];W[ni]
;B[nf]C[$ Good];W[qh]
(;B[ph]C[$ The contact play invites White to get stronger. You do not want this. White is almost dead here. A little more subtle seems better - Q13 (connecting R14 towards O14). See variation for a possible followup.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[rh]C[$ Better P12 to attack and get some eyeshape. But the White group seems pretty dead now.]
;B[oi];W[pj];B[oj];W[pk]
(;B[nh]C[$ Q13 is crucial. Now White cuts off your R14/S16 stones which shifts the balance considerably. White cannot cut at P12 IMO (see variation)]
;W[pg];B[oh];W[pf];B[qk];W[ql];B[pl];W[ok]C[$ I think Black can still cut at R13 but this is difficult to read out. See variations but there are surely better moves have missed.]

(;B[rl];W[mn]C[$ White should leave all of this for later (as Ko threats)]
;B[lo];W[qg];B[nj];W[rn];B[qn];W[po];B[nm];W[nn];B[ol];W[sk]

White still ahead. This will be close...];W[me];B[mf];W[le]
;B[ke];W[kd];B[jb]C[$ Good - you take sente.];W[kb];B[ka];W[la]
;B[ja];W[mb];B[fr]C[$ Too cheeky. You'll end up in gote. I think it should be possible to keep nibbling small areas off the White left territory. B7 looks promising.]

;W[am];B[an];W[al];B[lf];W[og];B[ng]C[$ So you managed to gain ~15 points in the endgame. Not too bad IMO!

I think you were too quick in your conclusion that you were doing so great by capturing many White stones - White seemed ahead most of the time. A big let down was that you let White expand the top right territory so much, this almost cost you the victory. But your better endgame technique made up for this.

I hope this review was interesting and helpful for you. Good luck at getting better!]
