C[Hi,

This is a game I recently played. It is a German online tournament.

I played black in this game.

I placed some questions within the file where I was unsure during the game and afterwards.

I hope you will enjoy the game and commenting.

Thx in advance

C[I though a little about Q3 instead but feared Q6.];W[pn]LB[pq:A]
C[janr: I feel white must block at A];B[pq]C[janr: yes, this is big.]
;W[or]LB[nq:A][nr:B]C[janr: maybe A (or B??) is better shape as no cut remains.]
;B[pr];W[qn]
(;B[qo]LB[ro:A][op:B]C[janr: A is the normal shape.
Also, I would be tempted to first see white's reaction to the cut.]
;W[op];B[om];W[pl]LB[ql:A]C[janr: the jump is bad shape since black can cut.  A seems better]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[ql];W[rl];B[qk];W[ro];B[rp];W[rk];B[qj];W[rn]
;B[rr]LB[rj:C][sk:D][sm:B][so:A]C[Safety first. But I am not sure if white is able to attack the corner. But there a so many possibilities, so I defended.

As black I would play A and expect white B, black C white D.]
;W[rj];B[qi]C[Here I thought about P9 instead but I didn't like a white stone on R11

janr: I prefer R11 too];W[nl];B[ol];W[ok];B[pk];W[nm];B[ri]
;W[nn];B[pl];W[sm];B[ip]LB[hq:A][dr:B]C[And this is very important I think. Somewhere around here or a move like O17 instead?

janr: O17 looks natural, but given white's wall an invasion is probably good too.
A is the most common start
The next common move is B.];W[iq]
(;B[fp]LB[ip:A][hq:B][dr:C]C[janr: no. once Black attaches at A he should continue, e.g. with B.  Unfortunately, the ladder doesn't work, so black should not have played A.

I still prefer C above the game move.];W[cq]C[janr: Now white also gets the corner.]
;B[cp];W[gp];B[fo]LB[eq:A]C[janr: I feel black is overconcentrated now.  I would prefer A]
;W[dq];B[eq]C[When I reviewd this I think now simply playing G3 is better.

janr: if you plan to sacrifice, just playing G3 is better instead]
;W[er];B[gq];W[ep];B[hp];W[go]C[janr: white shouldn't play the unfavorable ladder]
;B[gn];W[qf]LB[qi:A]C[janr: group A becomes weak.  With a stone at O17, the fight in the upper right would be easier.]
;B[ho]C[I played this a tempo. But perhaps a move at P13 myself is better. an then taking the 2 stones.]
;W[og]LB[of:A]C[Getting difficult.

janr: I prefer A, which can not be cut.];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[rg]
C[janr: living inside is not a good option I think.];B[qh];W[qe]
;B[pe];W[qd];B[qc];W[rc];B[pb];W[qb];B[pc];W[oi]LB[ni:A]C[janr: other fencing in moves (e.g. A) are probably better]

(;W[rd]LB[sd:A]C[janr: I prefer A for more eye space.];B[sh]
C[This got a semeai between those 2 groups.];W[sg]C[janr: the white shape is poor.]
;B[se];W[sb]
(;B[rf]C[I was very unsure about this semeai. So I decided to let live both groups.

And at that time I thought I were ahead.

janr: black can win the semeai.];W[ra];B[oh];W[nh];B[pi];W[mh]
;B[lc];W[jc];B[le];W[ek];B[dj];W[bp];B[bo];W[eo];B[en];W[bq]
;B[cn];W[fm]C[janr: white's move is not useful.  Blacks i not forced to connect.]
;B[fr];W[eq];B[jq];W[jr]LB[kq:A]C[janr: white is unreasonable.  Atari at A is normal.]
;B[kq];W[hr];B[gr];W[kr];B[ir];W[is];B[hq];W[lq];B[kp];W[ir]
;B[jo]C[This maybe too small. Sould I have played a move around H10?

Another idea, I had during the game, was H17.

janr: capturing is good for black, who gets strong and neutralizes white's wall.]

;W[me]C[janr: white has no more cutting points.];B[ge];W[fe]
LB[ek:A]C[janr: white is trying too hard on the left side with small moves.
'A' has become aji keshi (a bad forcing move).];B[ff];W[ee]

[jl:A]C[This was definitely too optimistic.

I think now, that white got too many stones in the center. He will be able to connect some which makes the game close.

janr: instead of cutting, it is better to just reduce.  If white answers a reduction at black A, black can switch to endgame at B.]
