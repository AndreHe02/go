C[Hi my name is Andrew. I recently had a game reviewed and played this after taking the persons advice to heart. My main problem most of the time is that I am unsure how to respond to white's attacks. I feel I did really well this game. Please feel free to add in comments at any time. Any and all input is appreciated. If there was something I did wrong or could have done better please let me know. Thank you for reviewing my game. (side note-I am playing against Many Faces of Go 18 kyu)
-Andrew];B[qd];W[co];B[dd];W[op];B[ep]C[On my last game that was reviewed White was able to secure two corners easily because I decided to play at the sides and secure big moyo's (I think that's the term) instead  of invading. So I decided to take the reviewers advice and attack.]
;W[jq];B[hp];W[fc];B[db]C[Was this a good response to White's attack? If not what could be better?

H: I think you should play d14,
to avoid to be easily confined 
to the corner.];W[qi];B[pn]C[Good spot to attack? What could be better?

H: I think, an invasion at  R4
will be better.];W[ql];B[qp];W[lc];B[nc];W[id];B[dj]C[H: Generally
you should attack or defend.
May be N3 is better.];W[cl];B[dl]C[H:
The black stones 
are too dispersed.
May be C10 is better.];W[cm];B[dm]C[H: 
Same observation.
May be at C9.];W[dn];B[en];W[qf];B[pf]C[Good response?

H:  Avoid contact play, 
if you don't have a special reason.
I think O16  is better.];W[dg]C[H: 
Now you will have much trouble.];B[ef];W[eg];B[ff];W[lp];B[no]
C[H: Your stones in the corner 
are weak. So it may be better 
to strengthen them with Q3.];W[np];B[mo];W[lo];B[mp]C[Since White didn't fill in the space between his stones I decided to play there.]
;W[mq]
(;B[ln]C[Was this a good move? Or should I have cut at O3? I felt if I cut there It would end badly for me. Thoughts?

H: Right, see the variation.];W[kn];B[mm]C[Was this move too passive?

H:
No, you need strong stones.];W[fg];B[gg];W[gh]
(;B[hf]C[Was this too submissive? Looking back I feel that I should have cut at F12

H: See variation.];W[fj];B[ei];W[fi];B[fk]C[Was this a good move? If not what could be better. I like to ask a lot of questions. I really enjoy playing Go and want to get a lot better. :)]

C[The following sequence seems odd looking back.];W[kd];B[le]
;W[ke];B[lf]C[Looking back I feel that I should have cut at some point. I don't know why I didn't.]
;W[kf];B[lg];W[kg];B[kh];W[eb];B[ec];W[ii];B[ih]C[Good response?]

;W[oj];B[nk];W[ok];B[nl];W[ol];B[oi]C[Decided to cut and see if it would pay off.]
;W[nh];B[oh];W[kj]C[If White wouldn't have played here it was where I was going to cut next.

H: 
Don't expect White 
to be totally blind.];B[kl];W[mk];B[ml];W[ng];B[nf];W[og];B[pg]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[qh];B[of]C[Was this a wasted move? Looking back I feel it was unnecessary. That's another thing that I do a lot is play moves that aren't necessary or sometime I am too submissive.

H: Yes, this move is not necessary,
but thinking in all variations 
is not always easy.];W[hh];B[ig];W[gd];B[he];W[hk];B[hl];W[il]
;B[im];W[jk];B[jl];W[ik];B[hm];W[jm];B[jn];W[km];B[jo]C[H: at L5, 
and capture three white stones.];W[ko];B[jp];W[iq];B[lq]C[Decided to go for another cut to see if it would pay off.]
;W[kq];B[lr];W[mr];B[ls]C[H: At L4 and capture 6 stones.];W[ms]
C[H: White should connect at L4.];B[kp]C[Now I have white stones trapped.]
;W[gj];B[gk];W[gl];B[fl];W[fq];B[gq]C[Was this a good move? Or should I have played at F4 instead?

H: I think at H3];W[fp];B[fo]C[H: at D5];W[eq];B[dp];W[dq]
(;B[cp]C[Should I have played C3 instead?

H: See variation!];W[cq];B[bp];W[bo];B[do];W[cn];B[em]C[Looking back I feel this was yet another unnecessary move.

H: yes];W[eh];B[dh];W[ch];B[di];W[gm];B[gn];W[bq];B[ap];W[aq]
;B[eo]C[Another wasted move correct? This should have only been played if White plays at A5.

H: correct.];W[pj];B[mg]C[I think White playing at Q10 made me nervous, hence why I capped the stones.

H: very nervous. 
At least play P17 
when you are nervous.];W[hd];B[kc];W[jc];B[kb];W[jb];B[la];W[ej]
;B[ek];W[gp];B[hq];W[hn]C[I almost played at H5, but right when I was about to I notice my stones were in atari.]

(;B[ae]C[H: see the variations!];W[kk];B[ll];W[om];B[on];W[nm]
;B[nn]C[At this point White resigned. I feel I did really well. A lot better than my normal gameplay. I think I did a great job with some of my cuts, but I realize that sometimes I play moves that are just unnecessary. Once again thank you for reviewing my game.
-Andrew

H: Fine, and from now on you 
can play with a 17Kyu - Robot.
