C[Hiya Jeffrey ^_^

This will be my first review, so feel free to e-mail me or IM me about something if I had not covered it well. With that said and done, here comes my review.

My overall comments will appear at the end of this file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

D14 is unusual.

In opening play at go, the most orthodox strategy has always been:

Start at the corners, race to the sides and crawl to the middle.

The reason why is that when you start at the corners, you can easily form a live group because you got two walls covering your group. The next easiest way to create living groups are at the sides, where you have one wall to work with. In the middle, well you're on your own there, but thats the hardest place to make a living group.

D14 emphasizes side over corner. More often than not, most people would place their stone at D17, C16 or D16. These moves emphasize the corners.

See variations.];W[dp];B[pi];W[dj]
(;B[eh]TR[jp]C[Instead of E12, it might be more helpful to go somewhere around K3. In the beginning of the game, you're basically rushing to plant your flags, which basically means to place your stones on or around the star points, starting with the corners, then the sides.E12 won't do much for you. K17 would have been great too.

See variations.];W[jp]C[Now would have been a great time for K17/16, to plant the final flag upon that starpoint . Unfortunately your opponent took advantage of that opportunity.]
;B[pl];W[jd]
(;B[je]C[Contact play such as these are only good when you have stones nearby for backup, but your nearest stones are too far away for them to help out in this situation. More often than not, contact plays will lead to disaster. There are other moves.

See variations.];W[ie];B[jf];W[if]C[Leafshade [23k?\]: Hi]
(;B[kf]C[L14 creates a shape known as an empty triangle, meaning that this shape will not offer you as many liberties than if you were to keep extending. See variation.

However, at this point in the game, fast and light moves are preferred over slow and heavy ones. This means that simply extending shape will not alwys get you territory, and its best to do nice jumps like one pint or two points jumps.
See variation.];W[jg];B[kg];W[ig]
(;B[jh]C[Best not attach K12. Your opponents groups is strong. Attaching to your opponents strong groups will only make them stronger. Best leave it be since it is most likely to live at this point. Find another place to play: C7, G3, N3 are all prospective invasion points. It'd work to your advantage to try and play there.

See Variation.];W[ih]C[drakelord [24k?\]: how long have you been playing?]
;B[gi]C[Leafshade [23k?\]: um... one or two months I think.  I don't play often though
drakelord [24k?\]: lol much longer than me
drakelord [24k?\]: just a few days here~];W[dd]C[drakelord [24k?\]: and I've only gotten a few games in those days]
;B[ce];W[de];B[cf]C[Leafshade [23k?\]: pretty much the same here.....]
;W[cd];B[dg];W[fg];B[ff]C[Leafshade [23k?\]: a few days and already at 24?  That's good....]
;W[gg]C[drakelord [24k?\]: nooo
drakelord [24k?\]: I played low rank people, and they moved up
drakelord [24k?\]: so my rank moved up wtih them
drakelord [24k?\]: I was like, NOOO
Leafshade [23k?\]: hehe];B[hg]C[Wedging H13 in between two of your opponents strong groups itsn't exactly the best idea. It starts off with two liberties, and its disadvantageous. The fight that follows is not to your advantage either.]
;W[hh];B[hf];W[gf];B[he];W[hd];B[ge];W[fe];B[gd]C[Normally this isn't the best situation to be in. Your opponents J13 group is extremely strong. However, your opponent left several weakpoints.]

;W[cj];B[ck];W[bj]C[At this point, connecting at E11 is urgent!]
;B[bk];W[bi];B[ei]C[Leafshade [23k?\]: ........wow.  I'm so dead.

White couldn't save it in this situation, believe it or not. Consider the "Shortage of Liberties" concept in the variation.

Even if A12 is played, 
In all possible cases s/he loses the D10 group.]
(;W[lc];B[ah]C[drakelord [24k?\]: ehh, you could have saved it

You might as well have played S12 and reduced the  S13 group's liberty. Or better yet, cut at K18! It would have saved that G16 group.]

[cm][om][pm][qm][rm][on][pn][qn][rn][ro][so][cs][ds]C[Overall, your game was alright. You seem to have a knack for mid-game fighting, but you need to work on your opening alot more. Your opponent made alot of mistakes, and usually for beginning level players, its all a matter of who makes the least mistakes! Nevertheless, don't rely on your opponents mistakes. 

Count the liberties of your groups, its very important. Study some tesuji concepts such as "Shortage of Liberties" - tesuji is really fun. You can kill your opponents groups in such fun and clever ways.

Also, study life and death problems like crazy. That'll help you so much, its not even funny.

Consider goproblems.com - contains life and death and tesuji problems - look at the problems from elementary to easy. Once you get familair with everything, your games will improve significantly.

Anyways, its been a pleasure reviewing your game, and I hope to see you in the near future online.]

(;B[jq]C[K3 basically disrupts your opponents "moyo" (The basic structure created in the beginning of the game which is meant to define your territory). The reason why I say K3 over a move like say, K4 is that it is easier to "make life on the third line" (Go Proverb).]
