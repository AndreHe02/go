C[First off, thank you for reviewing my game.  Despite the questions I pose,
I am  interested in any general trends that you  see as to where my weakness
and  strengths lie. My questions are preceeded  by my name.]
;B[pd]C[Dear Rex, it's always a pleasure to review games of people aware of the
polite opening. Very rare on IGS.];W[dp];B[qp]LB[pq:A][oq:B]
C[Why here? You allow him influence on that side of the corner, where he
really would like to play. If 3-4, better at A (part of the chinese opening
afaik). Or play simply 4-4. If you're eager to experiment, play B to get
the option for the shimari at 3 later.n
This way you invite the kakari at B.];W[oq]
(;B[op]C[It's a bit unusual to play this joseki from a 3-4 stone (even it is not
quite wrong). I prefer a move like shown in the variation.]
;W[np];B[oo];W[pq];B[qq];W[nq]LB[kq:A]C[Solid, but too slow. Better A.]
;B[qn];W[dd]LB[kq:A]C[Compare this position with the variation on move 5. Basically the same,
but your right side is somewhat open and W's lower side is more solid. Think
of W's position, if he had played 10 on A.];B[cf]LB[fd:A]C[Rex: Should I have played F17 instead? I've seen this often in pro games.

It's a bit a question of taste. If you like a game with two big moyos, I
think A will be good. On F 17 I'm afraid of the attach and extend joseki
(that you played ind the lower right corner), which gives W too much
favours concerning the middle.n
But with your unsettled right side in mind I think, this move is ok.]
;W[gc];B[bd]C[Rex: Should this move have been first at  C11, then later here?

Right, but you can even extend out to D10, gaining flexibility and prevent W
from getting this lucrative point.];W[cc]C[But if he answers, why hesitating?]
;B[ci]C[D10?];W[ip];B[pj];W[cl];B[cq]LB[pc:A][jd:B][jc:C][lc:D]
[kd:E][fp:F][gp:G]C[Why that??

Even if you live in the corner in gote, what's it worth?n
W gets his lower side save and enough strength to put your left side under
pressure with profit on the upper side or to back up an invasion to the
right.n
The points you destroy under risk could've been made by yourself with a
simple move like A, saving the corner, strengthen the right side and giving
you the chance for a beautiful extension to B.n
If W extends to C, there are moves left like D and E, not to speak of his
still open lower left corner, being now much more interesting with a neutral
middle to be expected.n
If you want to cut the corner from the lower side, try F or G, leaving room
for some aji in the corner.];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[bq];B[fq]
;W[ep];B[gp]C[Rex: I wanted to cut the corner and lower side apart. Somehow I feel this
a bit of an overplay as the shape looks to open.

Let's say: You could've had it easier ;-)];W[pg]C[A smiling gap.]

;B[qj];W[qi];B[rj];W[oi];B[oc]LB[pc:A][lc:B]C[Irresolute.n
Take the corner (A) or extend (B).];W[ld];B[hq]TR[ld]LB[jd:A]
[jc:B]C[Not strong enough.n
Better try the pincer at A or B, pushing (A) the marked stone against your
corner and simultaneously increasing pressure on the upper left corner, or
(B) connect underneath it.];W[ei];B[dk];W[dl];B[ck];W[ef];B[eh]
;W[ek];B[di];W[ej];B[fh];W[df];B[dg];W[bc];B[be];W[el];B[mb]
;W[qc]LB[re:A]C[Rex: When W played here I was very confident that I could kill him. Is
there a way for W to live in the corner?

The corner is supposed to be yours. But W can threat to connect from the
outside, thus reducing your corner to a minimum. A is a good point for W.]
;B[pb]LB[re:A]C[ What, if W plays A?

You could've avoided this trouble by saving the corner definitely in move
45.];W[qb];B[rd];W[rc];B[qd];W[sd];B[se];W[re];B[rf];W[sf];B[sg]

play big points.];B[se];W[pc];B[ob];W[sf];B[sh];W[rh];B[si]

C[??];B[mo]C[Nice kikashi.];W[mp];B[fo]LB[jc:A]C[too slow.

A is the point to make profit.];W[kn];B[of]TR[pd][qd][rd][qe]
[qf][rf]C[The marked stones are save.n
What do you want?n
Cut off the W right side group?n
Too difficult, just take the profit on the upper side and play calmly to the
end.n
You are about 25 points in the lead and there is not much potential left in
the middle.];W[ne];B[pf]C[dito];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[nf];W[lb]
C[good for W.];B[me];W[md];B[pe]C[unnecessary!];W[nd];B[mf]

(;B[gg]LB[ac:A][ab:B][ad:C][bb:D][pr:A]C[no!

There is no danger at all. Even if you played F13 (unnecessarily), you get
one more point than here, but imagine to play at A. (that on Q2)n
See variation.n
Compare that to the result of W playing move 196-202 (198 should be on
Q1).n
It's a total difference of 8 points!

But before playing that big gote, look for sente plays like black A, white
B, black C, white D.n
It's worth three points and you're still in action.];W[jr]C[bad]

;B[ng];W[ph]C[Rex: Could you give me some hints on how better to play this endgame?

It's that easy as I mentioned before:n
First play all sente, then the biggest gote play.n
Try to figure out, how many points a move brings for each , if he plays
there first. The difference is the real value of that move. In the most
cases the moves at the edge are very valuable.

In fact, there are not many moves left now, so back up about 30 moves and
look for them.];B[de]C[gote];W[ee];B[ce];W[do];B[dm];W[cm];B[ac]

It was quite a pleasure, though it maybe sometimes didn't sounded like.n
On IGS only few games are that free of big mistakes.n
Both of you played a nice game worth looking at and I think with some
reflections about the points I made you certainly will improve straight.

If there are any questions or objections left, feel free to ask.

Best wishes,

Pete])

B and C to settle down on the left side. And there are still big gaps in his
lower side.]))
