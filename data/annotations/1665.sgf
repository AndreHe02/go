;B[pd];W[dp];B[oq]C[Not sure weather to take the upper corner or play kakari in the
bottom.  I figured Kakari, and even if he take the 4-4 point
in corner he still has not secured any teritory yet and I can
pincer the lower right stone];W[po];B[oo]LB[qp:A]C[ not really sure what the joseki is for this so I played it safe
and jumped into 3-3

I think A is better]
(;W[qq];B[ce];W[dc];B[cc]C[Again this similar looking joseki, I really haven't seen too
much so I make an extension]
(;W[dd];B[cd]C[not very good for white :

- black is ok on the left side and ahead of white
- white's 2 stones are not strong : white must extend
- it would be better with a white stone at Q16

see variation for a suggestion];W[hc]C[12 seemed like a respectable way to settle my stones

8 and 10 can be attacked];B[pf]LB[nc:b][fp:A][cn:B][ql:C]C[this seem weak play by black, considered an attack at 'b' but
figured if I make a kakari play black will answer and then go
play the attack in upper right

it is too slow. A, B and C seem better];W[cn]C[too slow];B[fp]
C[after 15 I play a pincer thinking that I will extend right after
the pincer doing 2 things at once building territory in lower
middle and attacking two weak black stones on right];W[hp]LB[jp:A]
[on:B][pn:C]C[black could make a counter pincer at A : would you like it, as white ?

As white I may not answer and play B which I think is big : if not, what if black C ? B allows to extend on the right side]
;B[fn];W[kp]LB[np:b]C[I get what I expected but now after review it seems like I should
have played at 'b' instead];B[pj]LB[on:1][no:2][pi:3]C[ with 19 I am a little worried about moyo on upper right

Yes indeed : 16, 18 seem little and not safe (too high) with respect to sequence white 1, black 2, white 3]
;W[nc]C[this is okay but I really couldnt think about how to attack in
upper right

You can think about it later : play safe before invading];B[pb]
C[I expected something like 21 and guessed that I would just extend
back making large solid territory and I could still later attack
the right side];W[kc]LB[ne:A]C[to slow : A is better : make 3 dimensional shape]
;B[pm]C[I felt good so far but after 21, and 23 I feel like Im losing
the initiative];W[pn]C[not really sure if this was best, playing scared maybe]
;B[ci]C[again black is really staring to develop]
(;W[op]LB[on:A]C[so I start an attack

??? you enable white to strenghten !! A is still better];B[pp]
;W[np];B[qp];W[pq];B[rq];W[rp];B[qo]
(;W[rr]C[see variation about another possibility];B[qn];W[on]
;B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[om];B[ro];W[sq];B[ql];W[mn];B[nm];W[mm]
;B[ol]C[That fight did not seem too good for me I really feel a need
to take control of the game, but I guess on review it really
is about even

the result is ok : you get the lower side, black gets the right side

I think the variation is better however];W[ph];B[nq]C[I saw the black 49 attack before but I thought I could  catch
it];W[mp];B[lq];W[mq];B[mr]
(;W[or]LB[kr:A]C[I would play A];B[nr];W[pr]C[you have lost sente]
;B[jr]C[couldnt figure out the right tesuji for this and was running
out of time, probably a good way to attack];W[kq];B[kr]C[again cant find the tesuji]
;W[ls]C[is this move good at all

it's fine];B[hr]C[I though black  should connect at a but he ran with 61

if black could connect, you should not have played 60 !

if he connects, he has only 1 eye];W[lr];B[ks];W[lp];B[hq];W[iq]
;B[ir];W[gp];B[fq];W[dr]SQ[ph]C[black attack under on the bottom but I still live and catch some
stones and get to 70 so I felt that I won that exchange and also
black did not answer [\] and that is really where I want to attack]
;B[er];W[eq]LB[ck:b]C[that was a weak play by me I think  'b' was much better


Oh yes !];B[fr];W[ck]C[but I figured that black had to answer and then I could play
74 but I really want to get over to the black right moyo]
(;B[dg]SQ[ci]C[seemed weak to me it let me go attack, but on review I see he
was defending my last play so [\] was a great play

about 75 see variation];W[rg]LB[og:1][oh:2][nh:3][qh:A]C[I really did not know where to attack this at all

I think 48 is too high if you want to invade : on the 4th line, you can't create a living base, and it's not very good to run away : think about black 1, white 2 and black 3.

So if you want to invade, I prefer A : if black closes the side (for instance 76), you can still run away]
;B[rf]C[after much thought I start the fight];W[qf];B[qg];W[qe]
;B[rh];W[pe]C[Im liking the way it is going so far];B[pg];W[oe]
C[now the corner is in trouble I feel better now

play S15 before];B[oh];W[re];B[sg];W[qc]C[not sure if 88 was necessary of the best place to play]
;B[qb];W[pc];B[rc];W[rd];B[nb];W[mb];B[oc];W[qd]C[I can see trouble coming now but figure all I really wanted to
do was crush his corner so I dont need it as my territory but
I still think I could of had it all if I had the right tesuji]
;B[mc];W[nd];B[lb];W[lc];B[md];W[od];B[ob]SQ[rb]C[I see that I need to play at [\] but think that I can play a make
black capture then go play [\] huge huge huge mistake and definately
cost me the game

yes you must ! first defend, then attack]
(;W[kb];B[rb]C[Now I see I am in deep trouble]
(;W[la]C[wrong move I need to start running out now];B[me]C[really hurting now thought about resigning but maybe it can run
away];W[nf];B[mf];W[nh]C[this was a misread I didnt see it all the way through]
;B[ng];W[mg];B[og];W[lf]C[thought I could try for a liberty fight]
;B[le];W[lg];B[ke];W[je]C[but it wont work , I feel as if I am now far far behind but  on review I see that even after losing those stones I think I
am still ahead I want to make moves that expand and solidify
some more territory but

Game is lost !];B[kf];W[jg];B[ne];W[jf];B[of];W[kg]C[seems okay and the game is still about even although I feel like
I am 20 pts behind];B[ni]SQ[mh]C[playing [\] seems weak so I try to attack but not really a great
move];W[fo];B[go];W[eo];B[ip];W[gn];B[ho];W[fm]C[overall that was again a pretty bad exchange but I figure I can
give up a couple stones and build a solid wall for some territory]
;B[hn];W[gm];B[hm];W[io];B[jq];W[jp];B[gq];W[ef]C[dont know about this move. during this stage of the games I really
am lost. do I attack his stones , build my wall, extend to the
center, really feel lost here but no that even with the huge
mistakes I made just recently I am still in the game but dont
know how to use my sente];B[dk];W[dl];B[cr]C[I didn't think we was able to do that from my reading so....]

he still my might have a fight down in lower left corner but
he gave it up];W[dj];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[dh]C[thought since he did reply before I might have a good attack
so I tryed 160];B[ch];W[df];B[cf];W[eg];B[cg];W[di];B[hi];W[hh]

black plays soft because he thinks he's ahead. you grasps some points, and it's fine]
