C[Hi, thx for reviewing my game
I have been playing for a month
My problem of losing this game is because i am not placing my stones right to gain or protect my territories....and to attack opponents territories....

I am black, lacking on basic knowledge, and i have been reading books to improve

sry for bad english
thank you];B[pp];W[dq];B[pc];W[dc];B[pi]C[I have been using this shape many times, but i don't know exactly wt are some pros and cons about it, it only do well when someone don't attack right away]
;W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[jq]C[Maybe L3 is better?

L3 would have been a little better.  It prevent white from moving at m4 later to reduce your territory.]
;W[qe];B[nc];W[oe];B[ld];W[gq];B[dj];W[lq]C[The move is the 1st problem i encounter]

(;B[mq]C[attaching to the stone here makes it stronger when white extends.  see the variation...]

(;B[ks]MA[jq][jr]C[This is where you should have played n2 instead.  The marked stones aren't really salvageable.  You could use them for pressure later on though...]
;W[iq];B[de]C[I should do N2 to my stones...

You didn't need my help to see that one ;)  Always look out for your liberties when playing on the second line...

Also, this the move at d15 is easily cut since the supporting stone at d10 is so far away.]
;W[mr];B[nr];W[ls]
(;B[fc]LB[ed:A]C[Never, ever, ever (well, at least 90% of the time) use the double diagonal jump to connect your stone.  You usually end up spending more time defending the cut at A than anything.  Even attaching to your opponents stone at e17 would be stonger since you would have a more easily defended connection.]

I can't come up with anything here.  See the variation at N4 (Move 38)]

;B[qi]C[so i decided to cut him];W[rh]

You just need to work on some of the basics that I've marked here.  If you have any other questions, feel free to email me at jheiney@lhup.edu or look me up on dragon go server (static_e)]
