(;W[nq]C[I think it will be hard to make territory on the bottom side, both for black and white.  White is thick around F3, but black can push at  F1 and maybe white can block.  Black can also play H2 followed by M3 to invade.  I would prefer to make black play in the small area and break up the right side. by approaching on the other side at R6.]

(;W[kp]C[My reasoning was to keep the weaker group better connected and not to play too close to my thickness.  Is this a bad move?

As I said, it will be hard to make territory in this area.   If you are going to have to work hard, you should get a lot more.  I would have played something like O5 to make the potential area as big as possible.]

(;W[io]C[Not a winning move.   Should I just run on the bottom?  If I do, then I thought j6, wg8, b8 is painfully -- w makes gote life on bottom and is weak in center and on bottom.  This way, I make g8 sente and get a thick center to attack the scattered b stones around line D at least.  But it was a painful sacrifice.

I think playing on the bottom is OK.  I can't find a sequence that is good for black, but maybe that is just my limited reading ability. :-)

(In the real game my opponent let me make them live with a few tricky moves at the end and I won, but after move 140 this is the "what should have happened) version.)]
;B[in];W[gl];B[ip];W[jo];B[hq];W[dl];B[qi];W[qc]C[right time?

Yes, I think this is a good time.  Black is low at both K17 and R11, and you have a lot of strength in the center.]

;B[mc];W[ie]C[I liked this move, but maybe o5 or splitting b on upper left is better?]

;B[bi];W[bh];B[bj];W[gi];B[gf];W[ig];B[fh]C[Here I was a bit lost for the right move.  I wanted to invade his moyo.  But I did not want to play on around the "o" line because I did not want to induce him to strengthen the bottom.  I ended up playing some random moves that hurt more than they helped, though....

At this point in the game, black has about 25 points in the lower left and a moyo on the right side.  White has about 25 in the upper left, 10 in the upper right and maybe another 15 on the bottom, for a total of 50 + komi.  Black needs to get 30 out of the moyo to win, without white gaining anything else.  If white conceeds the whole right side to black, that is the 30 points black needs, but white may be able to get a big center. I would just reduce with something like O9. 
What are the proper points of invasion?  Any tips on how to reason that out myself?  Invading is one of my weakest areas.]

Right.  keep strong connections when fighting near enemy strength.]

(;W[nk];B[pk];W[nh]C[Now black has at most 40 on the right, 25 on the bottom left and maybe 10 elsewhere, for a total of 75.  White has 25 in the upper left, 10 in the upper right, 15 in the bottom center and 5 komi, for a total of 55.  White needs to get 20 out of the center to win.  With the weak black group on the left, that seems possible.

The way to determine whether to invade or reduce is to estimate the score and see what you need to do to win. In this case I think reducing is best because you get something and black gets something.]
