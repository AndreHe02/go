C[Hello, I just want to thank the reviewer in advance for reviewing my game. I played black in this game. I felt that I made many mistakes, and got away with the win as a fluke. Please correct my mistakes so i can strengthen my go.

rika:
Hi, my name is Chun-Kit, currently 5k IGS, 5k DE.
In your note you want me to give you some tips in joseki. Well... IT IS a difficult topic in go. You can see games where josekis were played out in all four corners correctly, but somehow one player has the advantage of the board.
Also in your note: review for both side, ok.];B[pc];W[dp];B[pq]
C[rika: 
Black 1 and 3 are called "facing 3-4 points".];W[cd]
(;B[fq]C[rika:
If white 4 were at wD16 playing the Ni-Sen-Rei-formation black will make a shimari immediately (most case). 
If black has the choice which side of the white corner to approach, I would go after the 3-4 stone (see var). The reason: It's too good for white to make an corner enclosure at wE17 now.
Also possible: bR15 for a relax opening (see var 2)];W[cn]
(;B[dq]LB[jq:A]C[rika:
(B) This is way to early to play here. Black usually plays there if white has a stone around "A". See some var. for normal continuation.]
;W[cq]
(;B[er]LB[ep:A][jq:B]C[rika:
(B) this is not good. Locally white won't hesitate to play at "A" - the pivot point. 
A ponnuki here is very powerful, that's what black wants. But normally black continues with bC2 (still assume there is a white stone around K3 - "B")]
;W[qe];B[qd]C[rika:
(B) slow move, other reviewer will say a bad move: just because you unnecessarily makes white stronger after the well known sequence]
;W[pe]
(;B[od]C[rika:
(B) too close. black makes a tiger mouth but cannot form a ponnuki. Better bO17 or bO16]
;W[qi];B[qk];W[kq]C[rika:
(W) !! Black can invade bR13, group is still unsettled]
(;B[jq]C[rika:
(B) Probably you know the proverb: "Don't Attach When Attacking"
Solution: bN3 or bJ3 (vars)]
(;W[nq]C[rika:
(W) better extend or crosscut];B[kr];W[lr]LB[qo:A]C[I felt that this move was a mistake by white.

rika:
sure, but I can't see a correct answer, maybe wR5 (A) to harrass the corner]
;B[lq]
(;W[mq];B[kp];W[lp];B[kq]
(;W[mr]C[rika:
(W) white has still yet an eye so run into the center]
(;B[ko]C[rika:
(B) To me atari is stronger];W[lo]
(;B[fo]LB[ln:A]C[rika:
(B) hane (A) is still strong against the white weakness];W[po]

(;W[pl];B[ql];W[pn];B[qn];W[pk];B[ln];W[mn];B[lm];W[mm]
(;B[cj]TR[cd][cn]LB[ll:A]C[Im not very good with moves like these, I am always affraid that all the stones i play there will die.

rika:
still pushing at (A) is enough, walls are powerful, and the influence towards the left side can't be neglected.
If you're afraid that your stones will die, play at the 4th line. But in this case where is the middle of the two white stones?

The upper left side is still undeveloped, so building an extention from the upper right corner is ok (see var)]
;W[cg];B[cm]C[rika: 
(B) again, touching stones makes opponent stronger, white corner will be secure and your two stones are white targets.]
;W[dn];B[dm]
(;W[bm]C[rika:
(W) this is gote (losing the initiative), better keep pushing]
;B[bl];W[bn];B[en]MA[bm]C[rika:
(W) that's the result of wB7: black's territory becomes clear.]
;W[eo];B[ep];W[dr];B[eq]C[rika:
(B) why not capture the wE3 stone first?];W[cr];B[do];W[cp]
;B[hm]LB[ll:A]C[rika:
(B) too small, still bM8 (A), or something in the top];W[co]
C[rika:
(W) I can't see any danger in that corner, go to the top.];B[ec]
;W[gc]C[Was this a correct response for my attack?

rika:
seems ok for me, since white has already an extention at C13]
;B[cc]C[I always make this move, I don't know if it is correct and effective.

rika:
quickly making shape is fine, probable result: you will be enclosed in the corner.]
;W[bc];B[dd];W[cb];B[ce];W[dc];B[ee]TR[cg]C[rika:
(B) without that stone bB16 is joseki, but you want to attack the stone, so don't give him the chance to peep and escape (bD15)]
;W[be];B[eg];W[cf]C[About here i felt that i messed up on the upper left side, and tried to flee for my survival.]

(;B[de]C[rika:
(B) don't connect all stones in atari, if you want to escape it makes your stones heavy and not much room to manoever.]

(;W[eb]C[rika:
(W) corner is secure, so first peep and make a base with the lonely stone wG17]

(B) this doesn't make any territory nor attack an enemy stone. good move for black: bL15 (A), bP15 (B), bM8 (C)]

rika:
your weakness are the cutting points. black will lose too much.]

[sf][sh][si][sj]C[Well... thats endgame and black won. I was sure white was going to win, but i guess black made a comeback. Thanks for reviewing.

rika:
ok, there are still 5 ko left, but it will not change the outcome of the game dramatically.
You have written white will win the game. Take your time and count who is leading. Then you will see the ko in the middle was avoidable. 
Well, many vars are without comments especially some ending game sequence.

A word to Black:
avoid to settle the corner quickly. first extend, and if the corner is still open you can invade.
if you want to attack a stone, don't attach.

A word to White:
don't stick into ko fights where winning that ko doesn't change the game.
