 I could not find any big mistakes on my part when looking over my game.  I was thrown off by white's second move (move 4).... it was
 instantaneous after I played my stone and I was waiting for an undo request, assuming it was a mis-click.  Also white made very odd
approach moves to my 3-4 stones that threw me off.  I did my best to play my best despite these odd moves.

Hello, itstoearly!
 I'm Igor (KGS - Crazyone [1k\]) and I'll do my best to review your game. If you have any questions, don't hesitate  to ask me via email.
Good luck and play strong!];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[ok]C[Indeed, p9 is a very odd move.]
;B[dc]C[Playing in the empty corner is a good answer to p9.]
;W[df]LB[fd:B][ce:A]C[Nikken-kakari is a rare move, but it's ok. White plays like this to avoid a pincer and/or to build some influence. This is a "light" move. The most common black answers are A or B. A takes the corner, B aims toward the side. 
For more variations see any joseki dictionary e.g. http://eidogo.com/]
(;B[ee]C[This move seemed a bit odd for me, but, surpisingly, it was played once by Cho U 9p 0_O
Still I'm too weak to understand it. IMHO A or B from the previous move are more simple.]
;W[np];B[oo]LB[qm:A][pn:B][oq:C][pq:D]C[If black whant to build a position towards the right side, ''A'' is a simple and solid move. If black whant  to build some influence, ''B'' is a nice move. ''C'' or ''D'' gives black solid points in the corner.]
