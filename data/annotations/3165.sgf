;B[pd]C[Hi there... In this game, I played as black. The game seemed fairly even throughout.

Note from the reviewer:
I recognise I made a "light" review for this game. But it was requested by Black who won by 13 points and didn't made big mistake. Anyway, I have tried to make my best during this review. Hope it will be useful for the players and may be to some other readers.

However, please don't take my comment for the only truth as it should be full of mistakes for the truth of a dan player, and worst for the truth of a pro player.

[pj:C]C[Denis: Good. "A" is usually also possible. It works well with the enclosure on the left. But in this game it invites white to play on either side at B or C.]
;W[qf];B[ph];W[qc];B[pc]C[I decided to try and make a wall facing the top side here, since I already had the enclosure on the top left, and I could chase any stones white played there.

Denis: Good reason. No problem with that.];W[qd];B[pf];W[qg]
;B[qh]C[perhaps this was a little greedy in view of my earlier plan, going for territory on the right side as well

Denis: You cannot let white run on the 3rd line either. So think r12 as a blocking stone and not and "going for territory on the right side".]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[qe];B[nd]LB[pg:A]C[this seemed like a pretty good outcome for black, right?

Denis: surely not bad. You exchange white territory against black influence. and this exchange is slightly in your favour, this is no doubt. But I would not say "pretty good" (don't be too confident), there is still a cutting point (A) and white can still invade.]
;W[ic]C[Denis: Good. white has no other choice.]
(;B[kd]LB[kc:A]C[Denis: May be better at A (see variation).]
;W[fc]
(;B[jc]C[Denis: Never play contact with a weak group. Playing contact is always strenghtening your opponent. As you just want to chase him, play from distance and use your influence]
;W[id];B[cn];W[fq];B[ql];W[qn]LB[fe:A]C[all the really big points seemed to be taken... I thought invading at N4 was better than taking territory with D12 since both Q4 and K4 are high.

Denis: D12 is not "taking territory" but "extending your moyo". If that was your choice, then A would have been a greater extension.]
;B[mp];W[oq]LB[pq:A]C[Denis: this is slow and not protecting the corner completely. To secure the corner, White should play A instead (but it is still slow).]
;B[nq]LB[mn:A]C[Denis: you must jump into the center at A.]
;W[nn];B[jq]C[if white cuts at L2, I might lose one group, but the other should survive. As it turned out, white played J3, which seemed a bit timid to me]

(;W[iq]C[Denis: indeed, white must play on the other side (see variation)]
;B[kq];W[ip];B[nr]C[Denis: I think it is still possible to try to escape instead of living locally.]
;W[or];B[os];W[ps];B[ns];W[qr]C[Denis: white should be happy with this exchange, he made sure territory.]
;B[mn];W[nl];B[rh];W[rg];B[pb];W[qb];B[cq];W[dq]LB[cp:A]C[Denis: not good for white. He is overconcentrated. White should cut in the other direction at A.]
;B[cp]C[Denis: too good for black. You should be happy with the white answer at d3]
;W[eb];B[db];W[fe]C[Denis: white had a difficult choice. I think he might have tried to invade the left moyo, but that would have let him with 2 weak groups (this one on the top and the would-be invasion on the left). As this is barely acceptable, white took the more reasonable choice to play on the top to strenghten his group and erode later the black moyo on the left.]
;B[dh];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[eh];B[di];W[jf]C[white seemed to do well out of that exchange.

Denis: I would not say that. Black takes big profit on the left side (15 to 20 points). White will never do that much with his top group.]
;B[ei];W[fh];B[je];W[ie];B[kf];W[jd];B[kc];W[jg];B[kg];W[qj]
LB[rj:A]C[I made a minor blunder here, I should have been able to connect with the variation starting S10

Denis: White goal was not to cut you, but to prevent you from making territory here. So, indeed you should have played at A.]
