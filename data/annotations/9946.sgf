;B[oo]C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking over my game. I was white in this game, which was played on standard time control (20 min+3x30 sec byoyomi) on Tygem. It is only 86 moves long and once again proves that the only thing that matters in go is reading how to kill and not die. My opponent was a lot better at reading than me and would have proceeded to kill every single of my stones, had the game continued. I would like to know the ways I should have used to not die. Getting destroyed like this doesn't happen often to me and I still really can't deal with people who just straight up try to kill me. Not sure what else to day about this game.

Hello,
I'm Julien, 1k on KGS. I'm gonna review your game and add comments and variations.
My global feeling is that you're not confident enough and you're affraid by any ennemy attack even when you're overwhelming it locally. Probably you need to do tsumegos and tesujis (on goproblems.com for instance) to improve and gain confidence in your reading. Also, before playing hane, be sure that you can manage if the ennemy cuts.
Hope this help.];W[pq]C[Don't want to get unusual situations with black trying to make a huge corner enclosure and kill me... maybe this is already a mistake by me. Then again, all that matters is not dying and this doesn't.

I can't say you lose this game because of this move, but it is probably wrong. The opening is unusual, but your move is a bit like falling into the trap. You should play a normal move in an empty corner and decide latter which move is best to approach this corner. Anyway if black adds another move in this corner in the fuseki, it will be slow.]

;W[pp];B[nq];W[po];B[mp]
(;W[fq]C[Wrong direction.];B[hq]C[seems I'm already lost, for some reason...

The black pincer is not the right direction too. So it is fine.]
;W[cq]C[This move is ok.];B[dq];W[cp];B[dr]C[cause this is the move that tries to kill you.

JS: this move is not joseki. Since it is on the 2d line for no reason, it is just a slow bad move... Just play a standard move on the 3d and you will be fine.]

(;W[do]TR[co]C[Have you carefully read the cut before this move? When you have such a weackness, you should always know what will hapend when the ennemy plays it. If you don't see how you will manage it: protect it!]
;B[cr]C[I decide to let black have the two stones and build the left side. But you can't actually build anything against someone who's better than you at killing things.

JS: you can't let black get this 2 stones: compare the final position with the one of the standard joseki. Letting the 2 stones would be just a disaster for white.]

(;W[dj]C[Compare this position with the standard joseki when white approach then play sansan: do you think it is fine for white?]
;B[qn]C[Black decides he will kill that side first.

It wouldn't appear if you have had a move to finish the "joseki" earlier. But this move seems to be overplayed (killing is almost always a bad decision).]

(;W[lq]C[I try to fight and use my wall, which is only a weak group though that looks like a wall.

Your "wall" is not that weak but it is not very strong too. But why do you want to fight so urgently? Where is the largest open position? The north is much more important now.]
;B[fp]TR[lq][mq]SQ[oo][mp][nq][oq]C[black says I die.

No. Black says: I have a weakness and I trie to fix it. Just ignore it. What is the urgent area? The fight between the triangle and the square stones.]

(;W[ep];B[gp];W[eq]C[this is a mistake. I should follow up around L3.]
;B[lp]C[black says I die.

Now you're in trouble. Do you the difference between white M4 and black M4? M4 was the urgent move.]

(;W[kq];B[kp]C[I realize that black is right and once again decide to take the outside by sacrificing. The game is basically resignable at move 41.]
;W[jp]C[Too late... Once again, did you have read the cut before hane?]
;B[jq];W[nr]C[bad move by me.

Yes. If you want to sacrify the stones, don't add additional stones if you're not taking advantages of them!]

;B[qf];W[jd]C[wrong shape. Not that it matters.

I guess this move is fine, even if the extension from C16 is a bit unusual.]
;B[em]TR[dj][bn][cn][hn][do][eo][go]C[black says he kills me.

Black is still overplaying. It looks like you're affraid by any ennemy aggressive move. Black has 1 single stone against 7 white stones (and your turn): you should thank him to help you :).]

(;W[fk]C[I say I kill black.

Killing a single stone is bad idea (except for cutting stone). Also you should fix your own shape before any strong attack.]

C[I resign. The last couple of moves I had basically already given up and wasn't reading. I hope you can tell me at which points I missed my opportunities to not get killed by black. Sorry, if this game wasn't verry interesting to review :) I still really hope to learn somethign from it.]
