;B[pq]C[kidimi [8k\]: hi];W[cd];B[oc];W[mp]C[how would you handle this approch

This isn't the 'open' direction of the Q3 stone, and so is usually only seen in a Chinese opening sort of position (where black has a stone around R9 already).

You should be happy to make a second shimari at R5 for example, giving you immediate territory while N4 is not doing much yet.]
;B[qo]C[Good.];W[qi];B[qk];W[qf]
(;B[iq]C[The N4 stone is high and already has no base, so it is better for this move to be on the 4th line, so it can run out more easily.

Another idea would be to kakari the bottom left corner, indirectly attacking N4. If white pincers, taking the corner is good enough.

You can also play in a different part of the board for now and let white worry about N4. The kakari at E17 is big. Probably you can come back to attack it later as reinforcing it would be slow at this stage for white.]
;W[gq];B[kp]C[i wanted to attack this stone but it didn't work too well, i would like tips on the following fight

Your two black stones are cramped and don't have good shape yet.
White can treat N4 lightly, being happy to make your stones inefficient and getting G3 in sente, or white can run away, and aim to attack your two stones in the process.]
;W[lq]C[You must block this at L3, as it concerns the base of both weak groups.]

(;B[ik]C[This sequence starting with J9 doesn't give you much eyeshape, but does make white stronger and lets white play L11 later. Simply continuing to jump out is best here, as you have a weak white group on either side.]
;W[ij];B[il];W[hl];B[lp]C[This sequence is also not good for you, as it weakens the O7 stone. There's no need to try to live here if that is your aim - you can still run - while living only strengthens white on the outside.]

anyoverall tips, anything i should work on?

Yes - the fundamentals of attack: only attack when you gain profit in the process, moves at the base of two weak groups are urgent, don't play forcing moves which strengthen your opponent.

Hope that's helpful :)])
