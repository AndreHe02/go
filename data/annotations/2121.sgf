C[Hi reviewer, I play white, and I won that game.
But it seems that I was very late in the fuseki.
 I would especially like to understand what  happenned in the beginning
Thank you.



M: Hi, I앐 Martin and I앏l try to make some helpful  hints on your game.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]LB[oc:A]C[M: B1 and 3 are the beginning of the  shusaku-style-fuseki. If W4, then B often plays 5 at  A to get a favourable position at the right side.
(see variation)]
(;B[fc]LB[oc:A]C[argllll, first question: a pincer here ?

M:This B5 surely isn앖 bad either! Now you wish you  would have played W4 at A to prevent B from  getting a double wing formation.
Yes, now I앇 play a pincer on the 4th line.];W[df]LB[jd:a][od:b]
C[M: You can try this too!
The B stones cannot get connected with 1 move,  that means there will be time to get in later.
But if B now plays at a or b for example, W will  have to fight on  quite a big disadvantage at the upper and the right  side of the board.]
;B[db]
(;W[cc]C[M: Even now you can pincer to make it much more  difficult for B! (see variation for one possible  continuation)]
;B[ic];W[po]C[most urgent move ?

M:There are other urgent moves, but this is the  most  urgent one.]
;B[qm];W[np]LB[pm:a][qq:b][on:c]C[M:Usually W tries to get good shape quickly by  attaching at a or b.
Getting out into the center is a good idea too, but I앇  prefer the solid kosumi at c.  As you played, there is the threat of the cut of the  keima. And...]
;B[qo]LB[oq:A][on:c][od:b]C[would a be the best white move here ?
How to play in this situation ?

M:... if you play 12 at c, B cannot connect so easily!
But you didn앖 play at c so perhaps it is best to play  elswhere now. The lower right B corner cannot be  attacked easily, the W stones are in no immediate  danger and there is one very important move left at  b. Locally a isn앖 bad, perhaps one line to the left of  it.]
;W[qp];B[pp];W[qn];B[ro];W[rn];B[pn];W[oo];B[rm];W[gd];B[gc]
;W[on];B[sn]LB[nq:A][dn:B][dj:C][od:d]C[ok, I have sente now: where is the best place ?
'a' to conterbalance (if possible ;) the huge black  territory in lower right corner
'b' to work with the beginning (huggly) group on SE  corner.
 Where else ? What is the urgent/big point ?


M: Both players have big spheres of influence of a  similar size. The question now is where and how  can they get into a moyo or even into territory  first and easiest?
I앇 feel that a move at d would be the best way for B  to make a moyo and that W has no comparable one  to do the same on the left or lower side.
But this is difficult.];W[dj];B[fq]LB[iq:A]C['a' was better for black, and this is where white  should have play first.

M: Right, if you want to play 26 in the lower left area  a move around a would be better because the W  stones in the lower right are much weaker than  those in the upper left.
The attack of B27 is ok, because the corner still is  open completely.]
;W[hq];B[cn];W[fp]C[I choose the weakest stone to attack it.
Should I have chosen the strongest one to build my  self against it ?

M: No, as you played you will get a wall facing up  north and this is where you are strong and where it  is difficult for B to invade. At the lower side youre  much weaker and much more open for invasions.]
;B[gp];W[eq]LB[fo:A]C[M: better to extend to A here to make a big moyo on  the left, this would be bigger than the corner!]
;B[fo];W[ep];B[gq];W[dn];B[cm];W[co]LB[dm:a]C[M: anyhow black lives so you앇 better play on the  outside (a) to gain influence and the chance to attack   the weak B group at the lower side]
;B[bj]C[Did I make any mistake in this corner ?
It looks like black settled well while white lost his  moyos ....
what do you think ?

M: see above, but you still can attack B, so the  result isn앖 that bad]
;W[jp]LB[io:A]C[was 'a' better or another place ?

M: A is better, because it압 more aggressive];B[hp];W[iq];B[ci]
;W[cg]C[M: quite small, W can not be killed easily here
this way you only defend about 10 points];B[bh];W[bg]C[M:again!]
;B[di];W[ej]C[M: you don앖 have to answer everywhere];B[ei]
;W[dm];B[jo];W[ko];B[io];W[kn];B[il];W[od]C[:-)];B[pf]
(;W[lc]LB[qc:a]C[M: It압 easier for W to take a base quickly by  attaching at a (see variation)]
;B[pc];W[oc];B[cb]C[M: this is a vital point for your group, but as you  already played twice to defend it, it should be strong  enough to be let alone for the time being]
;W[nf]C[M: good];B[pb];W[qh]C[M: good idea but too deep];B[qj]
LB[pi:a]C[M: B should play at a];W[oh]C[M: good for W];B[og]
;W[nh];B[ng];W[ok];B[mf];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[md];W[ne]C[M: overplay, better connect above B75]
;B[me];W[mg];B[mh];W[lg];B[mc];W[kk];B[mi];W[rf]LB[nj:A]C['a' looks better here: what do you think ?

M: Yes, if you get cut off you cannot make two eyes  here!]
;B[qe];W[cl]LB[nj:a]C[M: again you should connect at a];B[bl]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[qk];B[pj];W[pk];B[rk];W[rl];B[rj];W[oj];B[ki]
C[M: the two stones aren앖 very important];W[ij]LB[jj:a]C[M: again a move without a weakness (a) would be  preferable]
;B[gk];W[jg];B[fj];W[hk];B[hl];W[gl]LB[fr:a]C[M: if you attack at the lower edge, e.g. at a, you can  gain sure profit by  expanding your  corner group at the same time]

'cause next move is

M: Why???
You should have counted earlier because B is  slightly ahead, so you should have played more  aggressive earlier on!
That is, if you haven앖 seen B압 weak spot in the  lower right corner earlier.]
;W[qq]C[M:That압 worth about 30 points!];B[pr];W[qr];B[rq];W[ps]
;B[or];W[qs];B[rr];W[os];B[rp];W[oq];B[rs];W[eh]C[M: B did well in the opening and you had a hard  time to cope with his influence orientated style. In  the middle game you showed good fighting skill but  you won this game mainly because B played a very  bad endgame!

To improve your play you should try to learn to sit  back after every of your opponents move and  search for the biggest remaining move on the board.  In this game you much to often answered to very  small or even non existent threats of B.
On the other hand you played the very important  approach move in the upper right corner very late!

One more point I want to mention is your use of the  keima. It can be a strong move but often, especially  while defending, the potential cut through it is too  threatening. Then you should think of playing a one  point jump or a kosumi.

I hope my comments were of some help for you and  you enjoyed this review. If there are any questions,  feel free to ask.

Bye, Martin])
