C[Tokee [5k\]: hi have fun

*********

Heya,

Thanks for submitting this game to the GTL and giving me the 
possibility to review it. And thanks a lot for adding your own 
questions and thoughts to the .sgf file! I hope I answered your 
questions in a satisfying way, but if there's still anything 
you'd like to ask or discuss, feel free to send me an e-mail.

To distinguish my comments from yours, I preceded them with "fey:". 
Don't miss the variations I gave along the way and check the 
brief summary I put at the end of the game record.

And - as always - take everything I say with a grain of salt. 
A stronger player might think completely different about your 
game, though I tried my best to make my comments as useful as 
possible.

All right, let's start looking at the game now. :-)

[dp]C[This is possible, I guess.
Although this was so unfamiliar to me,
it stressed me a bit.

Why, by the way, do Pros/strong players nearly never start in 
the opposite corner? It allows the opponent to choose wheter 
its getting complicated or not (or so I feel).

fey: Of course this is possible - a perfectly normal move. Next, the R14 kakari is a good approach move for White which develops 
the 'strong' side of the Q5 stone, so there's absolutely nothing 
odd about White's move.
By not playing in the diagonally opposed corner, White leaves 
the choice about the character of the game to Black. Usually, 
cross-corner games tend to involve more fighting than games with 
a parallel opening. Especially if White is a stronger player 
than Black, it is considered polite to let the weaker player 
choose what kind of game he wants to play, so White often doesn't 
play in the opposite corner with his first move. Plus, challenging 
the weaker player to a fighting game like this is likely to be 
something the stronger player will like, as he can be sure to 
have an advantage in tactical combat.
Hm, but I don't know if pros really avoid playing in the opposite 
corner - my game database isn't able to support this theory, 
and I don't think that this can be generalized.];B[dc]TR[de]
[co][do][dp]C[I often start with this.
Because I played it often, I am comfortable with it.

fey: Personally, I prefer the C16 komoku in this situation. If 
White takes the lower left corner now, for example with one of 
the marked moves, he has a powerful continuation with the D15 
kakari, backed up by his stone in the lower left corner.
This might be a matter of style above all, in any case your move 
is certainly playable.
But still, playing D17 at C16 instead feels like establishing 
a better connection with your Q16 stone - if White plays a kakari 
later, Black can pincer and be almost sure to get a good result, 
as he is using the power of the Q16 star point.];W[qf]C[fey: I'd prefer taking the last vacant corner here. 
In any case, *if* White desperately wants to avoid taking another 
corner, the D15 or C15 kakari is bigger than this move.];B[nc]
;W[pj];B[dp]C[It felt so good to take the left corner.
Wasnt this some kind of slight mistake of white?

fey: Well, I wouldn't call this a losing position for White, 
but I agree that Black feels in better control of the flow of 
the game here, and taking another corner surely isn't bad. 
As White, I'd have avoided playing the R14 kakari in gote - either 
playing a kakari on D17 or simply and patiently taking the last 
remaining corner would probably have been better.
Still, White has the possibility to approach your D17 now, even 
though the situation on the left side of the board has subtly 
changed: Having taken the lower left corner, Black can now confidently 
pincer any kakari on D17, locally outnumbering White.];W[de]
LB[ce:A][cg:D][dg:C][dh:B]C[fey: Yep. Important move.]
(;B[ce]TR[nc]C[fey: This way, you aren't using the influence of your D4 hoshi 
properly. As I explained above, Black should definitely pincer 
here, putting pressure on White.
You shouldn't think about taking territory in the corner but 
rather about pressuring and attacking White, who is at a local 
disadvantage. See the var. please.

Pincering really seems natural, not only the influence of the 
D4 stone would shine brightly then but also because the O17 stone 
is pretty low, making the upper side unimportant. Any territory 
that Black will build up there will be small compared to what 
he could possibly gain from attacking a weak white group on the 
left side.];W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[ed]TR[id][jd]C[fey: Usually, Black plays this move if he already has a stone 
around the marked points or plans to build a moyo on the upper 
side by playing something like F14 later. So once you played 
here, you should aim to follow up this move somehow, maybe with 
K16 or J16 in this case.];W[cj]LB[cl:B][gq:A]C[fey: This result feels comfortable for White. His left-side group 
is safe and Black didn't manage to build anything impressive 
on the upper side.]
(;B[gq]TR[pq]C[I feel like the lower right corner is bigger right now.
But where to play there?

fey: See the var. for some of my ideas please. :)];W[cn]TR[cl]
[co][bp]C[fey: You should answer this move somehow - most likely you will 
end in sente anyway.
If you feel like fighting, C8 is a strong move, but it's also 
possible to simply defend the corner with one of the other two 
marked moves.];B[nq]C[I tried to play here now.
My idea was to have miai:

a) I can jump into the corner.
b) I jump to the left to get a base

fey: As explained in the var. above, P3 is the shape move here, 
but still I think that you followed the right idea and that approaching 
the Q5 stone from the outside rather than playing Q3 here is 
a good choice.];W[mp]LB[np:B][qq:A]C[this works ahead.
This move surprised me; seeing this, I thought that must be good 
for white.

fey: This seems to be White's desperate attempt to create a shape 
that resembles the joseki that usually follows a black approach 
at Q3. Well, Black didn't play Q3 exactly to prevent a pressing 
move like this, so I strongly doubt that this N4 is a good move.]

(;B[qq]LB[np:B][pp:A]C[probably an overplay?

fey: Heh, no. This move feels rather submissive to me, doing 
just what White wants. If anyone played an overplay, then it 
was White.
In go, it's important to understand the opponents plan and then 
try to thwart it. Here, White clearly wants to build influence, 
pushing Black down. To achieve this goal, White is willing to 
give up the corner, which is neither strategically important 
nor big and thus isn't that interesting for Black, too.
Rather, Black should try to deny White the influence he is hoping 
to build. The first move that came to my mind is the direct, 
simple cut. (see the var.)]
(;W[pp]C[fey: This is a strange-looking move, even though it's sente. 
As White, I'd probably play as in the var.];B[pq]C[I felt like I had to do this slow move.

fey: No choice, yep.];W[rp]LB[lq:A]TR[np]SQ[pp]C[fey: I can't help but feel that White's shape is a bit odd here. 
To defend against the N5 cut, he'd actually like to play O4, 
but I can also understand that he doesn't want to leave his right-side 
territory open at the bottom.
Maybe this shows why Q4 was not a good move.
Still, I think that playing O4 here would be better for White.]

(;B[lq]LB[mq:B][nr:A]C[I now wonder if I should better played A instead.
Or even B.
A would have been so firm. And, to go on, in the end of the game 
my group there also died. that would have been a difference of 
~30 points there. Loosing with 15.5 points that would have been 
deciding.

You see, I comment a bit on my own. Just want to see if I am 
right with my thoughts after the game.

fey: I think that you shouldn't think so much about which move 
is best for *defending*, but rather try to find a way to exploit 
the weaknesses in White's shape. 
As stated above, White couldn't simoultaniously patch up the 
N5 cut and prevent Black's S5 slide with his previous move, so 
you should try to take advantage of this. 
Keep in mind that you can still play S3 in the corner, which 
is almost sente and makes your corner group alive, so you can 
take the risk to fight a bit. (var.)

From point of defense, though, I think that B is best. A looks 
really submissive, as does S3, but your one-point jump to M3 
leaves quite some aji, so I'd recommend a more solid move here.]
;W[mn]LB[jd:A][qh:B]TR[of][mq]C[This feels like giving white such a lead!

Also he is strong there, while I have this weakness.

fey: I'd hesitate a bit to say that White is already firmly in 
the lead, but without doubt protecting the cut like this was 
a good move.
Suddenly, his shape on the right side looks good, the marked 
point has become a really nice follow-up and Black's position 
on the bottom seems flat and uninteresting.]
(;B[jd]SQ[qh]C[I am unsure wheter this is an overplay or not.

fey: No, this move is perfectly reasonable, though trying a reducing 
move against the right side might be another possibility to think 
about. 
Maybe this was your last chance to play the R12 invasion. (var)]
;W[of]LB[ff:A][cl:B]C[fey: Very big.]
(;B[ff]LB[ee:2][fe:1][ge:A][ef:B]TR[of]C[Is this very nice or very ugly?

building on a moyo, but a bit near his thickness.

But my idea was: after white 1, black 2, I would get either A 
(a ladder) or B (strengthening my moyo)

fey: Of course you are right in stating that this move can't 
be cut off, but I still don't think that it's that useful.
First, it helps White to patch up his only remaining weakness, 
as he did in the game with E10.
Second, you can't really hope to build a big moyo in the upper 
center - not without making White's moyo even bigger, that is.
Your move would be good if the marked stone were black, but like 
this, I'd say that you aren't gaining much from it.
As Black feels somehow behind now, maybe you should try to exploit 
White's last weak spot, hoping to benefit from the fight. (var)]
;W[ej];B[fh];W[dh]LB[mf:A][nj:B]C[fey: As White's three stones are connected anyways, this seems 
rather small, maybe reinforcing with E6 or the B4-C3-E6 sequence 
would be better.]
(;B[mf]LB[jf:A][mh:B]C[fey: Good, though you could also try something like the variation.]

(;W[jf]C[fey: I doubt that this is good, it seems a bit too greedy and 
most possibly presents Black with a chance to turn the position 
in his favor.
 
Creating a weak group inside of Black's moyo now isn't a very 
sensible thing to do for White who should probably stick to gentle 
reducing moves that increase his own territory at the same time. 
(var.)];B[he]TR[mh]C[fey: Too timid!
N12 seems like the natural move here, putting pressure on the 
K14 stone while threatening to reduce the right side.];W[rd]
C[fey: This move is not important right now. N12 is vital for both 
players.];B[mh]TR[jf]C[Now I had a huge moyo, far bigger than his.
Still, his marked stone had potential.

But I thought: well, I get later the possibility to invade, and 
now I also get a bigger moyo, or, if his stone escapes, I still 
get influence.

fey: White missed a chance here and the position looks indeed 
good for Black now.
Even is the marked stone still has aji, by trying to escape White 
would only damage his own positions.];W[qc];B[pc]LB[qc:B][mh:A]
C[a bit overconcentrated.
But I knew this and wanted to make this some kind of exchange 
(A with B)

fey: Black gained from this exchange. The corner is neither that 
big nor important.];W[md]LB[me:A][ne:B]C[this now totally surprised me.
So many possibilities!
What to save first?

Cut him there, cut him there, put an eye on my group?

fey: Actually, White's move feels like an overplay. I'd just 
cut with O15 and see what happens.]
(;B[me]C[I wanted to completely cut off this stone.

fey: Cutting is absolutely the right idea, but to me O15 just feels like a better move to achieve this goal, as your N15 leaves White with the rather nasty O16 push.]
;W[nd]LB[qc:B][me:A]TR[nc][oc][pc][pd][mf][mh]C[seeing this defect in my shape and his possibility to connect, 
"A" must have been a mistake.Maybe I should have played B myself.

fey: I think that not answering White's S16 was perfectly okay for Black. A has made things difficult for Black, though. When White invades with N16, your main objective should be maintaining the connection between your two marked groups - once they are connected and thereby strong, White will have to struggle for life, most likely severely harming his right-side territory in the process.]
;B[oe]C[But i wanted to cut off very desperate now.];W[ne]
(;B[od]C[i thought here: connect, and I will invade, too......

fey: What did you plan to do if White connected? I can't think of anything better than the variation, but that doesn't work well for Black, too.
Maybe cutting with O14 here would be an option worth considering, though it seems to lead to some rather complicated variations.]

(;W[mc]C[fey: A bit too greedy, as far as I'm concerned.];B[nf]
C[fey: Good. Seems like the only move.];W[nb]
(;B[pf];W[pb];B[pg];W[jb]C[his invasion was so big, bigger than mine.

fey: You both destroyed about equal amounts of territory, I'd say. Plus, it's Black's sente now, so the game is still playable.]
;B[hb]TR[nj][co]C[fey: This is too small. White has destroyed most of your territory up there anyways, and this move saves at most ten points.
Instead, you should take sente, trying to expand your center territory while limiting White's expansion at the same time, for example by playing something around O10.
Plus, some move in the lower left corner is also pretty big.]
;W[bo]C[fey: This looks like a misclick. Of course B4 is the shape move here.]
;B[nk]C[invade and expand was the aim

fey: Good! Nice move.];W[ol];B[gj];W[ji]LB[jh:A]C[surprising. i only thought about A before.

fey: I think that both this move and A are overplay. ;)];B[jk]
C[fey: Good.];W[mi];B[mj];W[li];B[ni];W[kk]
(;B[jj]C[fey: As far as I can tell, the L8 hane is also possible, but I can also understand that you chose this move because it destroys White's eyespace.
L8 simply aims at capturing more stones - something that is maybe well worth trying because the balance of territory seems to favor White at the moment - Black can't expect much territory on the bottom because of his defects there.]
;W[lk];B[ki];W[lj];B[lh]C[I was proud defending this moyo, but maybe he just played poor?

fey: Well, he couldn't really hope to get away with a move like K11, so this result seems like it was pretty expectable.
As I said above, I'd probably have tried to capture White in a bigger way, but still the result is okay for Black, though the center territory isn't all that big.]
;W[kn];B[jp]C[fey: Playing either S3, N3 or even tenuki to the lower left corner might be better than this move.
Actually, this K4 doesn't help to patch up your defect at N3, and you can't hope to build territory on the lower edge while it is still there, so maybe focusing on expanding your two corners would be better.]
;W[mk];B[nj];W[nl]C[fey: O8, of course, would have been a nice forcing move for Black, too.]
;B[ri]C[First game with so many invasions for me.
I rarely make invasions, because i have few experience in it.

But this was not through counting or logic, he just motivated 
me, so i tried for fun. =)];W[qg]
(;B[qh];W[ph]C[fey: I think that you can also answer with Q11 here.]

(;B[oh]C[fey: By allowing White to cut you like this, you unnecessarily endanger the life of your invading stone.]
;W[pi];B[qe];W[re];B[rg];W[rf];B[qk];W[pk];B[rm]

fey: Yep. Lucky. :)];W[ql];B[rl];W[sg]TR[si]C[I wanted to prevent the Ko, even if it was in my favour.

fey: You have some local ko threats, true, but defending is also okay.]
;B[si];W[rq]C[fey: Big, though I'd play the N3 push first, simply to create aji.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[bq]C[fey: Also big, though I'd say that defending at N3 is more important now that White took the lower right corner.]

(;W[rr]C[fey: Directly playing N3 would've also been possible for White. This way, Black gets the chance to protect his weak point without losing too much.]
;B[pr]TR[qp][lq][nq][pq][qq]C[this doesnt look like dying, only like being very overconcentrated.

fey: Hm. Maybe simply connecting at N3 is still better.];W[mq]

john2000 [4k\]: thx
Tokee [5k\]: what a game, nice

fey: This certainly was an exciting game that could easily have been a win for Black, too if you had realized that your corner group was in danger earlier.
All in all, I think that your strategy was pretty good most of the time, even though you missed the important point in some critical situations.
The main problem that I see in your moves is, as far as I can judge that from only one game, that you tend to think about defense too much. You didn't question White's overplays as much as you should have, rather accepting them as good plays and acting submissively. 
Try to obtain a more sceptical attitude towards your opponent's moves. Doubt them. Try to fight back if one of his extensions seems to wide, if one of his connetions seems to loose.
Try to think about the stubborn, resisting moves first before even considering defense - that doesn't mean that I want to encourage you to attack everything blindly, but you should avoid being pushed around by your opponent. Answering an overplay with a passive move turns the overplay into a good move.]

;B[mo]LB[nn:B][lo:C][lp:A]C[fey: To my mind, this is quite a powerful cut. Let's see how 
White can fight back...]
(;W[lp]C[fey: This is possibly White's most stubborn reply.]

territory.])

rather common. White is practically forced to answer.];W[ej]

(;B[gq]C[fey: This might look a bit slow, but it is certainly possible. 
If White defends the lower right corner now...];W[pq];B[kq]
TR[co]C[fey: ...Black just extends on the lower side. Later, C5 creates 
quite a big territory, so White is basically forced to go ahead 
and invade Black's position somewhere now.])
(;B[pq]C[fey: The second move that comes to mind is this kakari.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[mp];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[mq];W[lp]C[fey: As Black has sente now, I think that this result is okay 
for him. So far White doesn't have a way to effectively use the 
thickness he has just gained - if he likes, Black can use his 
sente now to negate any possible white moyo on the right side. 
I guess that this variation is playable.])
(;B[oq]C[fey: This would be another possibility for Black.]
;W[qq]C[fey: Normally White will simply answer here.];B[lq]
C[fey: This way, Black can prevent White from getting too much 
influence on the right side, but one has to admit that Black's 
formation on the lower side looks rather strange, too, even if 
this move is played on the fourth line.])
(;B[kq]TR[fp][pq]C[fey: Just calmy extending on the lower side might be worth considering, 
too - Black can play either of the marked points as a follow-up.]

(;B[dh]C[fey: Any pincer is okay for Black, but the two-space-high pincer 
is possibly among the most popular choices.];W[fe]C[fey: Let's say White plays like this, keeping things simple.]
;B[fc];W[he];B[hc];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[bb];W[cj];B[ei];W[cm]
;B[co];W[em]C[fey: Something like this is a likely continuation. While the 
game is still balanced, I feel that Black is doing better than 
in the actual game here. Basically both of White's groups on 
the left side are still weak and can be attacked sooner or later, 
and Black can be sure to profit from this attack.])

to build something big on the upper side with Black's marked 
stone already in place.]))
