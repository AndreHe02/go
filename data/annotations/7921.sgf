C[Fogel: I've added questions on certain moves in the SGF here.  All in-game chat has been removed from the file (not that there was much to begin with).  I am White in this game.

contact play on the upper left felt wrong, with strength around to support. pincer maybe?

--- start of comments ---
>tc> my comments begin with >tc>

when playing the big center style game, you need to judge what to sacrifice to keep it.
you built up a couple walls, but then ran out of space to defend.
the strategy was too heavy on the moyo side, the all or nothing strategy didn't quite work out.

n12 play in center was two steps away, a third may be ok with the other stone nearby.

white built up wall on top for small space, making stones heavy.
play more light, using supporting stones up there.

all of the stones on the left side were high, giving ample space for black to jump in

Q 13 seemed to kill some potential, forcing white to get strong.
it also allowed black into center on right rather than sacrificing stone on top right

pushed black down on left side to keep center for white
but at that point black had entered center from upper left.
push black into center and take more of side / corner

when defending upper right, use strength to allow gaps between stones, forming a stronger right side.
building from left side pushed him into your weaker stones.

there were some small plays in the upper right, defending a stone or two, take center in lower right, capping in black.


Fogel: I figured taking the last big point was the biggest move at this point in the opening, as opposed to trying to reduce or invade.  Is this correct?  
tom> taking that big point was good timing, but needed a low stone to help out, maybe C10?

Fogel: It seemed too early to defend against this type of move, so I played tenuki.  However, I'm not sure if this reduction was at the best point or not.  I don't know how to reduce moyos too well.  
tom> the timing of that center play felt good, you had some invasion points to threaten, which you forced him to defend.  by playing high like that you took away any possible invasion points.  I think this is why reductions are held off a bit, to be sure that invasions aren't worth it.


Fogel: I've never seen K18 in this situation before.  I feel that my own L18 was a mistake.  Would pressing down at K17 have been better?  Should I have tried an outright invasion (perhaps H17)?  
tom>  I like the invasion idea, with the support nearby.  

Fogel: At around this point, I'm not sure what to do.  I theoretically have more power in the center, but all his groups are safe, and there's nothing to attack.  I try to build some territory with what I've got, but I have too many weaknesses to get very much.  What kind of move would have been best in this situation?
tom> I agree, he is strong and your possibilities are limited.  I'm not seeing much options.

Fogel: This is very painful for me due to Black P13, wO14, bP11 threat.  Should I have sacrificed the P18 group earlier and played here first to avoid this?
tom> I'd let P14 go to seal off P10];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
;B[qk];W[nc]C[Fogel: I'm not too comfortable playing against the Chinese.  I know you're not supposed to invade it too deeply, so I thought I'd try an approach from the outside on the star point stone.  If B plays back, such as at Q14, I can get a solid base at the top.  If B pincers, I jump out, and threaten to invade the right side.

>tc> Nice plan for the opening, keeping your options open.  As you know, if you were to invade too deeply you may get a living group, but while attacking your group he would also be building up strength on the outside.]
;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[Fogel: He defended, so I get my base.

>tc> nice and peaceful exchange.  We get the feeling black's stones are connected, while white has some gaps, should be a fun game.]
;B[jp];W[dj]C[Fogel: I figured taking the last big point was the biggest move at this point in the opening, as opposed to trying to reduce or invade.  Is this correct?

>tc> excellent plan, reading ahead we missed any lower stones, C10 for example.]
;B[fq];W[dn]C[>tc> again, consider a lower point, D6 is better than E3 which would make black happy after his F4.]
;B[qb]C[>tc> black = pass, white should be having a smile after this move, it is quite small don't you think?]
;W[ok]C[Fogel: It seemed too early to defend against this type of move, so I played tenuki.  However, I'm not sure if this reduction was at the best point or not.  I don't know how to reduce moyos too well.

>tc> Excellent call that black's move could be ignored, so many moves out there would give more meaning to the game.  Invading may be too ambitious, but it is exciting.  We struggle with the trade off between having a fun game and winning.  Consider the boring and safe center stone, or two rather open areas around top left.  F16, C14 also come to mind.]
;B[pm];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[qh]
(;W[mh]C[>tc> good distance from q12, q11.  however here you also have p9.
given the three I would consider M12 or M11
later on came Q13, how about playing it now to give even more to jump from.
Q13 seems quite urgent for black to respond, helps wrap up the M14 area.]
;B[fc]
(;W[ec]C[>tc> the other white moves are pushing towards a large center.  E17 seems to invite black to move up into F14 area, is this the side effect you want?  consider the pincer of H17, or a simple C14]
;B[fd];W[df];B[jb]
(;W[kb]C[Fogel: I've never seen K18 in this situation before.  I feel that my own L18 was a mistake.  Would pressing down at K17 have been better?  Should I have tried an outright invasion (perhaps H17)?

>tc> tricky question.  

black was smart here, he accepts that O17 is alive, he's exchanging an urgent move where you must defend, so that he can get life for F16, which is his only chance of winning the game.

L18 = get some territory  8 points
K17 = strenthen center, but forces him to live, how about a more distant play?

with your strength so close wouldn't you rather H17 or H15 ?]
;B[jc];W[ke];B[jd];W[kd];B[ff]C[Fogel: B seems to have been let off too easily here.

>tc> good insight.  the invasion got black life and cut into the center.  white got a corner that appears solid profit.]
(;W[pg]C[>tc>  maybe a revenge move played in dispair that black got too much around F17?
seems not risky, black must respond and white gets some more center strength.
this forcing move would have had more meaning before N12 was played.

this and the next two moves seem to be played as "pass", waiting to see what black does next.

considering the placement of N12 and P9, it seems Q13 gives up some aji to attack around Q5.]
;B[qg];W[mp]C[>tc> reduction move that forces black to become strong on H3 area.]
;B[kq];W[nm]C[>tc> white == pass, making battle with phantom threats of black taking the center.]

>tc> white is happy again with this small move, but it is alive for sure.

the most recent growth is the D10 stones, how can we use those?  

threaten H17 area directly with H17? nah, black is way too strong, tall eye space.

threaten to threaten H17 area, less direct with H14?  maybe, forcing to one eye, but he just defends and has big H17 space.

threaten to cut into H2?  seems good as L3 isn't quite connected to Q3.  maybe lean into Q3 first to get L3 cut off, then the threat at H5 is more meaningful.]
(;W[go]C[>tc> from here on out white is making things stable, looking to end the game with safe moves.
try out some less direct attacks, where a forcing move preps you for another move.]

(;W[nh];B[oj];W[ni]C[Fogel: This seemed like the only move to avoid the Q12 group being captured again (the same tesuji works here too).  I've probably lost the game at this point, because I won't get more than 10 points from this area now.]
