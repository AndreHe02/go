;B[dd];W[qd];B[dq];W[pq];B[dj]C[Black might do better to play at d9, forming on the left side what is known as the high Chinese Opening.
c9 would be the low Chinese Opening less frequent than the high Chinese Opening).
If Black can get to play at d5, the left side becomes very hard for White to invade.]
;W[qo];B[fq]C[f3 is in the wrong direction.  Black should play d5 (or somewhere around k3).]
;W[jq]LB[od:a][cn:b]C[White at k3, after Black played f3, is probably an over-extention.
Besides 'a' and 'b' seem better places for White to play.];B[hp]
;W[qj];B[iq]C[j3 is a wasted move. What does it accomplish?  Much better for Black to approach the top right, at p16 or p17.]
;W[oc];B[dm]C[d7 secures a fair amount of territory, but Black looks overconcentrated.  Maybe k16 would have been better.]
;W[oe]C[White p15  isn't big enough.  k17 or f17 would have been better.]
;B[dg]C[Again, neither White nor Black seem to consider playing at k17 or k16 important...]
;W[jc]C[Finally!];B[fc];W[ld]C[White m16 too defensive.  White might do better to play around m4.]
;B[hd]C[White is slightly ahead in terms of territory, so Black should think of invading at the bottom, maybe with a pincer attack at m3 or n3.]
;W[oo];B[hc];W[pl];B[jd];W[qg];B[id];W[mq];B[jp];W[kf]C[good move by White]
;B[jr]C[too small for Black];W[if]C[White is expanding his moyo (territorial framework) while diminishing Black's prospects.  White is definitely ahead at this point.]
;B[hf];W[kc]C[White L17 is small.  J13 would be better.];B[ie]
;W[jf];B[ig];W[ke];B[jg]C[Suddenly, Black has been able to take the initiative on the top.]
;W[ib]C[j18 is an endgame move.];B[hb]C[Black should not have answered. Better for Black to play at k10, k5 or L3.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[lq];B[kr];W[lr];B[ir]C[No need for Black to defend at j2. If white plays there, black h2 is atari.]
;W[ln];B[kn];W[ll];B[kl]C[again, white has lost initiative in building the moyo.  The board is split in two, so it is crucial for both player to push the boundary.]
;W[lm];B[km]C[Does White realize that he is just solidifying the wall that gives Black more territory?]
;W[lj];B[kj];W[lk];B[kk]C[Getting worse for White.];W[lp];B[lo]
;W[mo];B[ko];W[hg];B[gg];W[hh];B[ih];W[ji];B[ii];W[ki];B[jj]
;W[li];B[jh]C[What does k12 accomplish? nothing.];W[ij];B[hj]
;W[ik];B[il];W[kg];B[hi];W[kh];B[hk];W[ha];B[ga];W[ia];B[ls]

;W[cb];B[ea];W[ca];B[da]C[d19 accomplishes nothing. black should play at a16 instead.]
;W[ad];B[ab];W[bb];B[ae]C[Black should have played at a19. If White plays there, he can get a ko (though white doesn't have good ko threats... still)]

;W[ep];B[dp];W[er];B[eq];W[fr];B[gr]C[good job by black on not giving white any possibility of life here.]
;W[nf];B[ic];W[jb];B[kd];W[lc]C[What happened? Did white resign?  I don't have the game info with me...
By my calculations, black is up by 16.5..])
