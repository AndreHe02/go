C[Hi Niall,

I'm Dieter, a Belgian 1st kyu living in Ghent. I hope this review will be of  use to you.

Because this was kind of a moyo game, and since the presence of ennemy moyo  seems to worry you, this will be the main focus of my review: where is  your/his territory and where is your/his influence. Of course, one should  not disregard the ennemy's building a moyo or restrain yourself of doing so.  Building moyo's is good, because:
- If the opponent does nothing, the moyo will be perfected, closed off and  become territory
- If the opponent comes in, a battle will take place, resulting in thickness  or territory for the owner of the moyo.

But territory is the ultimate objective of the game, and thickness  (strength, influence) is a way to get this territory in a natural way.
Here we go.];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[pj]LB[nc:a][mc:b][md:c]
[nd:d]C[I'm never sure  about san ren sai I always approach at the top left, are there other  alternatives?

----

D: You can always build a san ren sei yourself, or occupy one of the other  two star points. But since black is always one move ahead, a kakari is a  good agressive move. If you are tired of playing the keima kakari, you can  always shift to b,c, or d. But the keima kakari you chose, is the most  flexible move, which is why it is chosen so often by professional players.]
;W[nc]
(;B[ne]C[D: Moyo oriented move. Although this move is possible, it tries to  develop the right side, whereas the primary objective of san ren sei is to  build influence towards the center, upper and lower side. If Black  transforms the right side into territory, but that's all, we cannot speak of  a succesful san-ren-sei strategy.

Look at the alternative for this move (7).]
(;W[ld]C[This is OK, but there is a way to refute black's  strategy.]
;B[lf]C[Black continues to press White, building a moyo. Now White  hasn't the option of invading anymore (look at the var)]

(;W[jp]LB[id:a][jd:b][nq:c]C[I was fairly pleased so far, I felt I had  nipped this moyo in the bud by settling the stones at the top and then  playing the handicap point.

Is this so?

D: On one hand, Black 9 forces White more or less to defend at 'a' or 'b',  which is good for white: one likes to be forced to extend at the fourth  line.

On the other hand, black will then play 10 himself, and you might feel  impressed by the depth of his moyo.

So 10 is a good point, since it is a good point by itself, and it gives you  a good feeling. But even after White 'a', black 10, black's moyo is so deep,  that there is plenty  of room for action for white, staring with 'c' for  instance. Black's moyo is far from being transformed into territory, whereas  white already has a nice piece of territory at the  top.]
;B[cj]LB[fq:a][lp:b][jc:c][jd:d]C[11: dificult move to judge

Black defers his moyo strategy and suddenly shifts to an erasure move. In  intself, B11 is of course not a bad point. But 'a' or even 'b' would have  been more consistent with his moyo strategy.

'c' (or d)  is a possibility too, punishing white for not having stabilized  his group. I would play 'c', because I am an agressive  player.]
;W[nq]LB[id:a]C[Still better at 'a'.];B[no]LB[np:a][mj:b]C[This move  had me worried, I hadn't expected it and now I didn't know what to do about  the moyo.

D: as stated earlier, black is developing his right side only. Nothing to be  afraid of, but it is true that his moyo is swelling. You might have played  12 at 'a' instead.

Still you have a nice reduction point at 'b'. Look at the variation.]

(;W[qn]C[This is not so good. You are separating your stones.]

(;B[om]C[Too vague a move. Look at the var for a better move for Black  15]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[qq];B[po];W[qo]LB[pr:a]C[I don't know what you think of  the result, but this is really a big success for white. You make about 10  points, destroying all the potential that black had in the lower right  quarter. Moreover, you have a nice hane at 'a' and the stone at 10 is  already reducing whatever attempt for moyo that black will make on the lower  side. So the compensation he will get for your taking the corner, will not  be sufficient.

However, one cannot say that the game turned into your favour decisively.  Black's thickness is considerable.]
;B[gq]C[Here I was worried about the  stones on the lower side so I thought I'd protect the corner then counter  attack the stone just played.

D: No need to worry for these stones. 12 has no value and 10 is a light  stone.]
;W[cm];B[go];W[jn]C[Good.];B[ko];W[kp]C[It is better to connect. You have little prospects at the  lower side.]
;B[jo];W[lo];B[ln]LB[io:a]C[should be at 'a', leaving you with  two cutting points.]
;W[io];B[kn];W[hp];B[gp];W[in]LB[qf:a][rj:b]C[This  seemed a good result. But I still worried about the moyo ...

D:
Indeed: Blacks three stones are weakened. He will need to strengthen them  and give you territory at the left by doing so. You shouldn't worry about  his moyo yet. You have invasion points at 'a' and  'b'.]
;B[do];W[co];B[cp];W[cq]LB[dq:a]C[better at a];B[bp];W[bo]C[Oops. Look at  the var.]

(;B[eo]C[Bad mistake.];W[bq]LB[dq:a][ep:b]C[You can connect at 'a', leaving  more aji, but preventing the forcing moves at 'a' or  'b']
;B[el];W[hq]LB[jl:a]C[Your legitimate worry about Black's moyo should  make you play at  'a', strengthening your group, and reducing the moyo at  the same time.

If your purpose is to make some room for eye shape, then this move is  defendable, because it also affects the eye shape of black's group. For the  moment, however, 'a' is the better option.

Let's count some territory.

W:  15 bottom left (BL)
      10 BR

B: moyo=prospective territory of about 40 points. Good idea is dividing it  by 2. Which gives 20 points for black.

White has 25 points + 5,5 komi =30,5 points

So White already has the advantage of ten points, is thick (with the move at  a) and has some prospects at the UL and upper side.

White, if he plays a, is definitely ahead.];B[ql];W[id]C[Calm, steady move.  You make an additional 15 points, and you connect your stones. Is this the  player afraid of moyo's ? Good play.]
;B[cc]LB[jl:a]C[Black should develop  his moyo, playing at 'a'. The white group at the bottom is not completely  secure, so it has some value to shut it in.
B47 is too early.];W[dc]C[Good: you block at the correct  side.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[bf];W[if]LB[jl:a]C[Good. Still, 'a' is a valid point  too.]
;B[kj]C[Black perfects his  moyo.];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nd]
LB[oc:a][kh:b][lh:c][rd:d]C[Creative  defense, but the weakness at 'a' remains.

With 45 and 53, black has been able to perfect his moyo. If all of this can  be transformed into territory, it will be worth about 40 points. In the TL  corner, he makes at most another 10.

Besides the 25 in the lower half, white can count on about 30 at the top.  With komi, white is still 10 points ahead.

White has erasing moves at b,c and an endgame point at d.];B[ic]
C[Extremely dangerous (good) move. If black manages to make sabaki,  and escape with part of his group, white's lead can be overturned.]

(;W[hc]LB[jd:a]C['a' would be better not giving the opportunity  to make  sabaki. But both lead to complicated variations, one of which I give]
;B[jd];W[je];B[hd];W[ie];B[gc];W[hb];B[ge];W[gb];B[fc];W[fb]
;B[gg]C[Black  has destroyed some of the territory of white, but little aji remains in the  position. More cumbersome is the stone at 71, which may form some territory  in the future with 11,43 and 53.

The endgame has not yet begun, since both white and black have a group at  the bottom which is not completely stabilized. But the big endgame moves are  already big enough to play. Can you locate them ? I'll give the answer (that  is, my ideas) at the next move.]
;W[me]LB[rd:a][pr:b][cb:c][bk:d][db:e][eb:f][ec:g][dg:h]C[a,b and c are the  biggest ones. 72 is a good move, preparing 'a'

d is big
h is big as well: preventing the link between the black groups

c is important: black can play the sequence
e-f-c-g in sente];B[mf];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]
(;W[bh]LB[dg:a][bk:b]C[There is absolutely no point in invading here. You  should play 'a' instead, threatening the groups at the left and the right  simultaneously, and destroying any territory black might form left of 71.
'b' is also a valid move in this area, but should be left for later

This (78) might well be the losing move.

I included an agressive   variation.];B[cg];W[ci];B[di];W[bj]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[cl];W[bl];B[dm]LB[cn:a][bm:b]C[I  was pleased with this exchange, the rest of the game, seemed to be just a  little in fighting etc.


D: I apologize if I sound severe, but you shouldn't be pleased with this  exchange at all.  This result is very bad: you win about 5 points at the  left side, but in return black received the following benefits:

- His bottom group is completely safe, which means he can now start to think  seriously about attacking yours.

- His top group and the one in the top left corner are virtually connected  to the strong group 81-87

- Due to this thickness, black has now very good prospects of making points  in the center.

Also notice black's move at 'a'. You cannot respond at 'b', so you will lose  points there.

----

I didn't think anything changed too much from this point on.

D:  well, apart from the painful loss you suffered in the BL corner ... #:-7

Let's recall the focal points of this game:

- Black started with a moyo-strategy. White prefered to obstruct it, rather  then to compete with it.
- Black plays a lot of keima, which leaves weaknesses. White plays straight,  which is characteristic of better players.
- On the other hand Black keeps an eye on connecting his stones. In the end,  he had one group, which made his game more error-free. Black plays for  thickness. White is territory-oriented.
- With the exchange in the lower right corner, you took a teritorial lead.
- With the exchange in the lower left corner, where both players made a  reading mistake, white took an overall lead.
- At several points (12,44, 78) , you played too low to counter black's  center oriented strategy. When ahead in territory, you should not let black  become too thick. You should maintain the balance of thickness. Thickness  can be built in several ways. One way is bashing against the opponent's  territory (which is smaller than yours).
- With 59, black started some very threatening sabaki tactics, reducing the  white territory, while building thickness (71).
- The sequence starting with 78 made black so thick that he came ahead for  the first time in the game.
- Good moves of yours at: 24, 32, 46, 48, 52








Don't worry so much about the rest of the game. It was the moves leading up  to this point that are most interesting to me.

Thank you very much for your time.

Does all of this mean that '7' is a bad move. ? I don't know. I rarely play  it, especially not in the beginning. It's a one-purpose move, not very  flexible, but a better player than me is called for to say whether or not it  is a bad move.]
