C[chewtoy [2k\]: Hi
BlackHand [1k\]: hi
chewtoy [2k\]: Enjoy

chris: After a decent opening for both, white played a little weak shape so that he could not gain enough from attack the black weak group. i would recommend tsumego for both players. 

white should pay attention to good shape moves in the middlegame, maybe look at lee changho's games from around 2000. pay attention to how the solid shapes help attack opponents in the center.

black should pay attention to sente moves in endgame to reap the most benefits. endgame books exist, that list the value of standard moves. the ko for the bottom left corner, i assume, only occured because of byoyomi. a slightly lighter, more flexible play in the opening could be helpful.]

(;B[qo]LB[qg:A][qm:B][qn:C]C[chris: this seems to be a little slow, as it leaves A and B as miai for white. A corner enclosure at B would be more active.]
;W[jq];B[qh];W[qm];B[cn]LB[cd:A]C[chris:It feels like the top left is more urgent, as a corner enclosure with the hoshi stone can still be invaded, while a shimari at A cannot.]

;W[do];B[bn];W[em];B[jo]TR[qj][qm]C[chewtoy [2k\]: Is this too early?  Envious playing?

chris: while it seems the top side is more interesting, this move also helps a future attack on the marked stones. it seems ok.]
;W[lp]
(;B[cd]C[chris: tenuko from the bottom is not so good. probably better to use the momentum of the cap, otherwise blacks stone will be too weak to be able to attack properly.]
(;W[nn]LB[om:B][mo:A]C[chewtoy [2k\]: is this move too vague?  I thought is wasn't that threatening to K5 and it leaves a hole at N5.

chris: not only vague, but also it leaves 2 big weaknesses at A and B]
;B[ec]LB[jd:C][cf:A][bl:B]C[chris: wrong direction. the left side is open at B. black will get a strong position around A, which has no potential anyway. the most open side is the top, so black has to go for the C side with some sort of pincer.]
;W[fc]C[chris: correct.];B[dc];W[fd];B[cf];W[jc]C[chris: The game is good for white at the moment.]
;B[ip]LB[in:A]C[chewtoy [2k\]: Too heavy?

chris: yes, white should play A, making blacks shape difficult to handle.]

;B[gp]TR[dn][en][eo]C[chris: the last 2 moves: #1 pushing from behind. #2 pushing black towards the marked weakness, #3 giving black more eyeshape than he deserves. say thank you, black ^^]
;W[fq];B[il]LB[hm:A][dn:C][fp:B]C[chris: normal shape would be A. also consider pushing at B. it is sente right now, and threatens the cut at C later.]
;W[ij]LB[dg:A]C[chris: correct direction, still aiming for A.]
;B[kl];W[kj];B[ml]C[chewtoy [2k\]: White begins an attack, but I didn't think the attack had much meaning beyond chasing the black stones.]

(;B[ph]TR[pf][pg][qj][qm]C[chewtoy [2k\]: I wanted to get out into the centre to help my floating group.  but this was too costly I think.  I should have just R14.
