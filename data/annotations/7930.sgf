C[Hi there,
I made a few mistakes during endgame and lost, but I'm sure I made a lot of mistakes even before :) I need some new ideas to move on...


You name the right point here, you need to look at the endgame again. Practice counting. You seem to misjudge which moves are big and which are small.]

;W[pp];B[dc];W[cp]
(;B[eq]C[I just want to make kakari and then play around C15... But considering this, isn't better to play high approach at E4?

See variations for some patterns that cross my mind...


First of all you should think in a different way:
Do you want to kakari OR make a shimari?

"I want to have both" is usually a bad principle, you must decide, what you want more.]
(;W[gq];B[ce]C[Tenuki is possible, but I would answer, because the ladder is bad for black.]

[co][pq][qq][rq][sq][or][os]C[up to here I did dot realy make an important comment, but this point is truly important.

Try to understand this point in the game only and you will get stronger.

For me the endgame starts here! (All groups are settled)

w has
14 ur  20 l   11 r (a bit less, if b takes A) 5 o = 50 Points

B has, if he takes A
25or 12 u 4 center 9 ul = 50 Points

So the game is about even, but black can get mor points in the center.
Should black try to take these Points in the center now?
No! It is hard to make points in the center!
Impotrant Endgame Points are A, B, C und D after A.

Other big moves, but smaller then A-D are E, G, F.
What you should do here is try to count how big these moves are and play the biggest one.]

just count. B invested lots of moves and how much did he get in the center? Less than the valus of the A-B exchange.]

In the end b got nothin out of the center, but that is not the important point.
Jus remenber that big Endgame is usually on the second line,
and that the endgame starts when all groups are settled,
thats all.
