C[Hey, thanks for doing this review. I play as black. I seem to be in a rut lately that I can't get out of, and I'm not really sure where my most significant problem areas lie. I felt good about the game the whole time yet lost by 4.5 points. My comments are scattered throughout.

Hello, I will review your game.
I will make comments after the letters [NM\].];B[pp];W[dp];B[pd]
;W[dc];B[de];W[ce]C[nadare joseki more appropriate here? - I just settled instead.

[NM\] It is possible since Q16 is on 4x4.
I think C14 is often seen in strong games.];B[cf];W[cd]
(;B[df]C[[NM\] We often see F3 or even C6];W[fc];B[dj];W[nq]
;B[qn];W[jp];B[cn]C[I like this point.

[NM\] Yes it is good move];W[qi]C[[NM\] Perhaps black should play around F3, F4 area now before white gets sente to take F4]
;B[qg];W[ql];B[pq]C[This seems a little tight, but secure

[NM\] Q2 would also be possible];W[fp]C[[NM\] Very big move for white]
;B[lq];W[lp]C[[NM\] L3 instead perhaps.]
(;B[mq];W[mp];B[nr];W[np];B[or];W[jd]
(;B[mc]C[Should this move be at P-17? That was my other candidate

[NM\] I would prefer M17.
N17 still leaves weakness in the corner. 
P17 defends the corner but does not attack.
M17 has a follow up move at H17, or attach at K17

Another idea is to attack the R8 stones first. If black can do this in sente.
A play at the top is good as if white played O17 or O16 it would be very good for white]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[re];W[pb];B[ob]
;W[qa]C[[NM\] I think this exchange is satifactory for black. It seems still an even game at this point.]

(;B[rk];W[qk];B[rl];W[rj];B[qm];W[dl]C[[NM\] So white wants to make centre territory]
;B[cl];W[cm];B[bm];W[dm];B[ck];W[dn];B[co];W[nl];B[pj];W[qj]
;B[fj]C[[NM\] This move is solid, black must calculate that this reduction/ expansion will get enough points.

I would favour invading the bottom at H3 or H4];W[cp];B[bp]
;W[bq]C[[NM\] I think black needs a plan here.

The group on the right R8 is not stable and so attacking it may get points at the top.
How to attack is difficult. Certainly not directly.]
(;B[bo]C[[NM\] This seems a little slow and not big enough,]
;W[fe];B[kq];W[jq];B[kp];W[ko];B[do];W[eo];B[jr]C[Should I have cut first?]
;W[ir];B[kr];W[jo];B[gk]C[[NM\] Another solid move, I like the move]
;W[gm]
(;B[bf]C[[NM\] Its difficult to decide what to do now for black.
B14 is another very solid move.
Perhaps you underestimated the white potential centre.

A quick count now gives:
white 65
black 60.

So I think black must try a more active move.];W[pg]
(;B[jb]C[[NM\] I guess this move is not bad. Although I cant say I like it. 
Perhaps reply to the contact move Q13 because the R8 group is still attackable.]

CR[bp][bf][jr]C[I didn't think there was more I could do here, so I just tried to take what little I could. I've been criticized before for starting the endgame too early.

[NM\] Yes, white has made too much in the centre. Because of the gote moves at the edges.]

[NM\] So perhaps invading earlier and not playing endgame moves in the middlegame.

Although Lee Changho and top pro's sometimes play endgames moves early, depends whats happeneing in the centre. In this game it seems the middle was more important.

I can recommend studying strong amateur korean games  to get opening game ideas.

I made go software called baduK to study the opening game.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/baduk

These are my personal Tygem games I have downloaded.
Very strong recent Korean amateur games:

I would welcome any feedback on my review.

This would be nice point to invade. Better if L3 for L4 exchange had happened before.

Similiar to black F3 first.
