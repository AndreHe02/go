(;W[dg]C[J: I think this is wrong side. C16 and J17 are both low and also nearer to each other than J17 and Q16. When you approach with a solitary stone, it is very weak. Therefore you should also approach opponent's weaker point, instead of the stronger side. R14 would have been better, I think.

On another notice, both D13 and D4 are now high, which does not create a good balance on the left side.

Moreover, when you approach a stone on (3, 4) point (such as C16), you should always approach from the open side, not "from behind". That is, if your opponent would approach your R4, it would be better to come from the left side than from above. Now you essentially force your opponent to play in E16, which is a perfect corner closure for him - a move he would have loved to play anyway.

See variation.];B[ed]C[J: Here you see. Your opponent's stones in upper left corner are perfectly balanced, while your D13 stone looks alone and weak facing a strong black formation.]

(;W[cj]C[J: You need this stone to help D13, but as pointed out, it was D13 that caused all the trouble.]
;B[pj];W[kp]C[J: This should be low. Now all your stones in the bottom side are high, which is not a good balance. L3 would have created a very nice balance with R4 and D4.]
;B[qm]
(;W[cq]C[J: This is small. You secure the corner, but both your sides (left and bottom) are still wide open for an invasion. Better wait and see where the opponent goes. When the invasion comes, you can secure the other one of them. See variations.]

(;B[qc]C[DavidB [4k\]: here, I thought it was more or less still equal

J: It looks more or less equal in terms of moyo size, but if you compare positions, you'll see that black is in a better position. 

Black upper left corner is very good in terms of relative positions of the stones (C16, E16 and J17). Your D13 and C10 stones are very weak compared to them and a single stone at C12 or somewhere around the formation would instantly give them problems.

Black R7 and Q10 form a very nice balance with Q16 (R17 was not the best possible move, but let's ignore that for now) and are facing your weak R4 stone. If black plays around P4, your R4 would immediately be in trouble. While you're making small life in the corner, black could get a strong position facing L4, which he could later use into his advantage.

All in all, you have only two options for invasion (around N17 and Q13) and both are in the middle of stronger black positions. Invasion in either of these would make you run and give black an easy task to secure a lot of territory and close the other invasion point.

On the other hand, if you consider your own positions, there is an invasion point around D7 and basically the whole bottom side is open. Your stones are much weaker in terms of position, which usually will result in your opponent's favor, when later in the game you convert your moyo to territory. Your opponent can extend from strong positions and secure territory at the same time. You'll constantly be defending running from place to place defending your territory. In this kind of situation the one who's doing the attacking will usually win.

You should always try to create strong shapes. Extending/attacking from strong shapes is always more effective than from weak shapes. When you have a strong formation behind you, you don't need to worry about the escape route. When you are attacking from a weak position, you can not go ahead at full steam as you constantly need to worry about your back as well.]

(;W[oq]C[J: Here you see another problem of a weak shape. You have to play this slow move to strengthen your lower part's weak position. Had the position been strong, you could have extended from it instead of making this repairing move.]
;B[if]TR[nd][fg]C[DavidB [4k\]: looks too high, but I don't know how to punish and when
DavidB [4k\]: possible better moves?

J: Your comment on "don't know how to punish and when" illustrates the whole problem. If cou consider the position, you can see that your D13 and C10 stones are starting to look very lonely and ineffective under such a formidable black formation. There's no way you can mount a serious attack from such position. On the other hand you'll start to feel that they'll need help sooner rather than later.

Black can play this kind of big move (which looks too high) exactly because his positions are very strong. No need to fear being cut off from the rest of the stones. I feel this is not the best move for black, though. He has stronger position than you, so he should put more pressure on your weak spots and get more territory that way.]
;W[dn]C[DavidB [4k\]: too slow again...

J: Yes. But as I said in the move before this, your D13 and C10 started to feel lonely. Perhaps you felt it too and played here. Another sign of weak position.]
;B[iq]
(;W[fp]C[DavidB [4k\]: pathetic
DavidB [4k\]: now I'm lost as to what to do.

J: In this kind of situation (when you're already behind and the opponent makes an invasion) you cannot let the invasion be successful, otherwise you're certainly going to lose. It is difficult to see how you could kill the invasion, but at least you have to make your opponent run and try to build territory and/or influence at the same time. When you decide from which side to attack, always play away from thickness. Your left side is already strong, while right side (L4, P3 and R4) are rather weak. Now you leave black an easy task of getting out or playing a stone somewhere around N3 to split your stones.

It would be better to attack from the right, as this would push the lone black stone against your strong wall. There's no room to maneuvre there, which will give you much better chance to attack the stone, because (1) your opponent has less room to go and (2) you don't need to strengthen that side anymore. You can concentrating on pushing your opponent, without worrying about will the left side hold.]
;B[fr]C[J: Here you see one effect of the weak right side. Your opponent is in the middle of your stones, but he's in no hurry to try to get out. Instead he goes deeper. Moreover, in this position it is easy to see that F4 is in a bad position. (1) It does not attack J3 properly (there's still room under it), (2) It does not create almost any territory, (3) it strengthens a position that was already strong and (4) pushes your opponent towards your weak position. If black had played N3 (or something like that), that would certainly been rather irritating from your point of view.]
;W[jr]C[J: This is better. Take away living room from black and strengthen your weak position. A dual-purpose stone is always good.]
;B[jq];W[kq];B[ir];W[kr];B[gq]
(;W[io]C[J: This does not give you much. Your left side is too weak and too far for this to secure any territory. Black can live low, which is what he decided to do anyway. You should opt for making him run, while still possible.]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[eq];W[hh]C[J: Too thin. Your stone extends from a thin position a long way towards a stronger black position. Can easily be cut off or exploited.]
;B[ji];W[hj];B[jk]C[J: Here you can see the effect of weak and strong position. When you divided the middle part, you played along 'H' line, while your opponent came all the way to 'K'. Granted, there's room for invasion in black's position, but there's room for invasion in your position as well. From strong position it is easy to extend farther without getting a feeling of stretching too thin.]
;W[il]C[J: Here the game is more or less over. Black can secure a victory easily by playing safe from now on.

All in all I think the biggest mistake in your fuseki is playing weak shapes and letting (sometimes even forcing) your opponent to play strong shapes. After fuseki if your positions are weak compared to your opponent it is very, very difficult to win against an even opponent. Even though the moyo looks like the same in terms of size, the result is probably not going to be good. You have to constantly defend your territory (not getting more, probably losing some), while your opponent is constantly mounting attacks against you (not losing territory, probably gaining some). If all the small points go against you, you're going to lose in the end. Strong positions, strong shapes are the answer.]

(;W[er]C[J: This will take away black's base (if I read this correctly) and force him to run for safety. There's a long way to go, and in the meantime you can build infcluence towards black's upper/right formation. Later it's easier to invade that.]

(;W[fg]TR[kn][op]C[DavidB [4k\]: is something like this now a big move?  Or the marked areas?  The intersection of the two moyos?

J: This is a big move, but the problem is, it does not make your own positions any stronger. Black can still invade in many points and the whole area between F4 and F10 is completely open. Preventing black play here justifies the move, though.]
))
(;B[ch]C[J: Black attacks relying on his strong position in upper left corner. Result is either black get territory around B13 region (which was white moyo), or the white stones are separated. Either way, black will get more and white will lose ground.]
)
(;B[hq]C[J: Whaty now for white? No way to effectively attack the stone as L4 and R4 are weak. There's still a huge gap between them, so they need help -> black will easily establish a group here, taking territory away from white. And there's still place for invasion in D7 as well.]
)
(;B[np]C[J: Bad news for white. A big reduction coming, and still room for invasion elsewhere after this.]
))
(;W[nc]C[DavidB [4k\]: come in straight away?  but it still looked even.

J: Here you can see another problem with D13. Had you played R14 in the beginning, black would have not gotten territory on the right side. At this point E17 would still be open for invasion, allowing you to reduce black territory further. At this point when you invade, black will certainly be able to secure a lot of territory while making you run.]

(;B[fq];W[dn]C[J: You have a good chance of getting a big territory in the left.]
)
(;B[cm];W[co];B[em];W[fq]C[J: Potentially a very big bottom.]
)))
(;W[qf]C[DavidB [4k\]: Bigger here I imaginge.

J: As stated before, you should have played here one move ago. At this time I think this is a mistake, since now you leave your D13 stone alone. See the variation on how black could punish this.]
;B[di];W[fg];B[fi];W[hg];B[hi]C[J: (This is just hypothetical play, for demonstrative purposes) Here you can see what could happen. White is running, but there's nowhere to go really, as upper side is already partly occupied by black. Eventually white will, of course, find a way to live, but by that time not only has black taken good territory in the upper side, but also built influence facing lower white moyo. By using this influence, black will be able to make serious reduction to white territory.]
))
(;W[qf];B[nc];W[pi]C[J: This looks much nicer don't you think? Upper left corner is still open for invasion later around E17, so there's no need to rush there (escpecially not from the wrong direction). Moreover, your Q11 strikes rather nice balance with R4. Later, when black approaches from P3/4, you can play around R7 and the right side is most likely yours.]
