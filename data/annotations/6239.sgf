C[Hi!  Thank you very very much for looking at the game.

I played black and was ahead most of the time until some horrible mistakes.  White is a friend of mine and we mostly play each other, though I would like to play on KGS or another server at some point.  I really have no idea what rank either of us are, definitely low, however.

At this point I was 2 wins-40 losses or so against him, and had studied many replays/problems to try to get better.  I tried to use what I learned but he has no formal training and his unconventional play means I can't use most of it.  I put a lot of questions later, but will take any general tips and especially info on his weaknesses.

THANK YOU!];B[qp]C[This is a commentary for Black
There is absolutely nothing wrong with a 3,4 opening - howver there is a "BUT" or note of caution. The joseki that follow from this can be quite complex - so you need to be prepared.]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pd]
(;B[cf]C[So far so good for black - you are building a large moyo. Moyo are spheres of influence. Use Moyo to attack white. Don't expect to turn a moyo into territory. See variation]
;W[pj]C[I had decided to try to get better by learning joseki, but he does not know any and always responds in ways (usually attaching) that josekis don't cover.]
;B[kp]LB[op:B]C[You are playing a "High Chinese" - I'm happier with L3 the low chinese - has slightly fewer weaknesses. The alternative to L4 is P4 which takes profit. The otrher move worth thinking about is D10]
;W[qo]C[a strange move from white - P4 or R6 are more normal]
;B[po]C[He will almost always play the attach move here.  Is this hane the best way to reply?]
;W[qn];B[fc]C[definitely sente - but you need to be aware of the weakness you left at Q4.]

(;W[gc]C[Again...];B[gd];W[hc];B[fe]TR[fc][gd]C[the hanging coinnection around F16 leaves a weakness - you can be cut.]
;W[ec];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[fb];B[fd];W[cj];B[dl]C[C8 may have been safer - as it takes away the opportunity for white to make an easy base.]

C[White has bneen kind to you - you have a huge sphere of influence from bottom edge upwards.]
;W[de]C[white needs  to dive in to Q4 or P3 to take away your territory ! doesn't look like he's doimng that yet. It looks like black should be comfortably ahead now.]

C[now the tables are turning - you are letting white get a big (VERY BIG) corner. Your urgent move is to play a stone at n11 or m12 and then take the corner by invading at R17.]
;B[ih];W[gf];B[eh];W[dh];B[fh]LB[cg:a]C[Should have played A instead?]
;W[cg];B[eg];W[ch];B[bg];W[bd];B[ci];W[bf];B[di];W[be]C[I think white was looking for small life - not a very interesting exchange.]
;B[cg];W[bj];B[cs];W[ar]C[Was there any way to get this bottom group? I don't think so...]
;B[if];W[hd];B[hf];W[ge];B[lk]C[Obviously I am still not defending my area as much as I would like to.  Part of it is him forcing constant fighting, part of it is overconfidence on my part.

You are defending - and you need to attack. M9 is gote - now you are so strong you can play N12  and asee what happens - if he doesn't play to defend the corner immediately INVADE - and what his are shrink.]

Not surprised - yo are too gready - or you are not looking at the balance of position territory and strength and forgetting your weakness. 191 at Q4 would be a good result - all that's needed is a calmness to look at the whoile board and ask yourself where and I weak - where could white play to inflict more pain on me than I canb inflict back at wight.]

Think strategy as well as tactics, buit imnportantly let tactics SERVE strategy NOT tactics dictate stategy.
Once you get in  a mess re-assess take a loss leave the stones alone and play a big move (sente) somewhere elese. Later on there may be change to use the aji of the dead / weak stones to make other gains.]
