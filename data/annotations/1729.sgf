C[Dear sir,
   I am paweenwich, playing black.  After create a huge moyo, I though I have a chance to win this game.  However, after counting the stone, I lost 7.5 point.    Regard,

TJ: Hi! Please call me Tristan! I'll try my best to write a helpful review. :-)]
;B[dp]C[
 paweenwich 16k*: hello];W[dd];B[pp];W[pd]
(;B[nc]CR[qf]TR[pj]C[TJ: Not a bad move, since approaches in the opening are very big. But it would have been better to approach at R14 in order to develop the influence of Q4. Imagine what the position would look like if Black got to play at both the circle and the triangle marks (or thereabouts) - it would be very harmonious (see var.).]
;W[pf];B[kd];W[pb];B[hc]C[B) I am not sure how to response W Q18.  I hope H17 make my group more secure.

TJ: This looks like a good move to me :-)];W[fc];B[qh];W[qf]
C[TJ: Understandable attempt to keep territory, but a bit timid. White more or less insures about 15 points in the upper right with this descent, but that is hardly great value for money for four moves this early on in the game.]
;B[pk]C[TJ: Another good move by Black. Things are developing nicely. Black has less secure territory than White, but his frameworks are definitely bigger and his stones have more influence. Therefore, I'd prefer to be Black here.]
;W[fq];B[jq]C[TJ: Again, Black is playing positively. It is always great to be able to make a pincer that is also an extension (this excellent move not only attacks F3 in a pincer, but also develops Q4). However, maybe J3 would have been even better, since it leaves White with less breathing space.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[fo];B[dn];W[nq]
(;B[np]C[B) I intend to build a big moyo  on buttom right.

TJ: Seems a plausible plan, but on the other hand, Black would really like to exploit the fact that White has now given himself two weak groups to defend on the lower side.  Personally, I'd like to play P3 and Q6 to attack O3 and create "almost territory" (it would still be open at the 3-3 point, but White would have other things to worry about first). See variation.]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[mq]
(;B[lp]C[B) Is L5 better?

TJ: It also looks good, but I cannot tell whether it would have been better.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[jr]
(;B[ip]C[TJ: This is not good since it gives White too much territory. White does not have time to cut at K4 since he still needs to settle the L3 - O3 chain. I have suggested another variation beginning with J3.]
;W[iq];B[jp];W[hr];B[gp];W[fp];B[hq];W[ir];B[oq]C[B) Is Q3 better? (to close conner)

TJ: I think this makes better "shape" than Q3, but R3 is troublesome.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[B) any better move?

TJ: I think Black has to take a deep breath and go for the kill with Q2. Normally White can then live with S5, but in this case Black has an enormously powerful wall to work with, and that should guarantee him some success.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[or]
(;B[nr]C[TJ: A tactical slip. Q3 would get the corner.];W[pq]
;B[op];W[pr];B[rq];W[rr];B[sp];W[sr];B[nh]C[TJ: The tactical error at O2 notwithstanding, Black should still be in the driving seat. White has got about 20-25 points on the lower side, but Black should have at least that amount in the area from R12 to P4 alone, while he also has huge thickness and influence.]
;W[cj];B[cl];W[cf]
(;B[cr]C[TJ: A very small move at this stage. A play around J10 or K10 would be gigantic.]
;W[er];B[jj]C[TJ: Bravo!];W[li]C[B) What is a correct way to handle this?  I alway lost a lot while protecting my big moyo]

(;B[lk]C[TJ: This doesn't seem right to me, because this move is a bit close to the wall (remember that the prover says "Don't play close to thickness, either yours or your opponent's"). On the other hand, Black does want to get some territory in the centre. I would possibly choose K12 or the boshi ("cap") at M13 and force White to squirm for life - even if White lives, Black should get big compensation elsewhere.]
;W[mk];B[mj]C[B) I think M10 should better?];W[lj]
(;B[nj]C[TJ: A tactical error. Black should play L9 and White cannot escape with his N9 stone because the ladders don't work (see var.).]
;W[kk];B[ll];W[kj];B[kl];W[jk];B[jl];W[il];B[ik];W[ij];B[hk]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[hn];B[go];W[gn];B[fn];W[ji]
(;B[fj]C[B) This is a very bad move.   Just G9 might better?

TJ: F7 should work, since White cannot get you in a ladder with the cut at G9.]
;W[gk];B[hj];W[fl];B[fm];W[gm];B[el];W[gj];B[hi];W[gi];B[hh]
;W[ek];B[em];W[fk];B[dk];W[fi];B[hf]C[B) Any better move?

TJ: No, this looks about right. Yes, you have suffered a loss through your mistake at F10, but you should still get about 35 points, maybe 40 from your moyo, which would be good in addition to 15 in the lower left and 10 at the top.   Let's count it (conservatively):

Black - Centre 35, LL 15, Top 10 = 60
White - Bottom 22, UR 15, UL 26 (no komi) = 63

A small lead for White, but if Black gets sente to play big endgame moves like S13 and G18, then he should have a good chance to win.]
;W[kg]
(;B[ii]C[TJ: Takes away an eye, but be very cautious about making moves like this - you are also shortening your own liberties. Black's J9 chain has only three liberties and poor shape, which might have come back to haunt you later...

How about N14 confining White's group?];W[mg];B[ng];W[mf];B[nf]
;W[me]
(;B[oe]C[B) I think O15 is better?

TJ: I might have played the cap at N17 and allowed White to link up, then proceeded to the big endgame move at P18. Black should probably forget about killing the White centre, and choose territory and big endgame instead (see var.).]
;W[mc];B[od];W[ne];B[of];W[nb];B[lc];W[nd];B[oc];W[lb];B[kb]
;W[pc];B[ob];W[oa];B[la];W[mb];B[gb]C[B) or I should invade the conner?

TJ: I don't think invading with C17 is very realistic - if it worked, it would almost certainly be because he defended inaccurately, and you should not try to win by playing dubious moves. Your move is sente and large, and I would therefore prefer it.]

(;W[fb]C[TJ: White might be advised to ignore this and play the equally large move at S13 to make a trade (see var.).]

(;B[fe]C[TJ: F19 is very big. If he answered if, then you could proceed to play S13 (see var.)]
;W[dj];B[ed]C[B) What is a correct way to reduce the white conner at this stage?

TJ: F19 is very big! :-) On the other hand, what you played was also very effective!]
;W[ec];B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bd]C[B) I can feel that this is a bad move also.]
;W[df];B[ee];W[bc];B[gd];W[jm]
(;B[ln]C[TJ: Why not L7? White cannot push in at L6 because of the atari at K6.]
;W[ld];B[kc];W[ke];B[je];W[jf];B[ie];W[jh];B[mh]C[TJ: Time to grab S13!]

;W[cg];B[fd];W[qi]C[B) I am very regret by this W move.

TJ: I don't think it quite works, but you need to read these situations with great care.]
;B[ri];W[qj];B[rj];W[pj]
(;B[qk]C[TJ: P11 saves the day (see vars.). However, it takes very careful calculation.]
;W[oi];B[oj];W[pi];B[ok];W[jj];B[qb];W[qc];B[qa];W[rb];B[if]
;W[ih];B[en]C[TJ: Black played well, especially early on. But he lost the game because of various tactical errors.   To improve your reading, please read and re-read James Davies "Tesuji". I found it very useful to copy out an example of every kind of tesuji into a little private dictionary and study them over and over again until they became second nature. Doing easy tsume-go (life and death) problems is also very good for your reading.

To summarise, Black showed better strategy, but White finally overcame him by being more accurate at tactics.

I hope this helps. Best of luck!

;B[id];W[jd];B[jc];W[fb];B[fa];W[ea];B[ga];W[db];B[bk]C[TJ: Let's count it now:

Black:

LL 20, CENTRE = 42, TOP = 16  Total = 78

White:

UL = 22, BOTTOM = 24, UR = 12, NO KOMI
Total = 58

Comfortable win for Black if he can get the big endgame moves and if White is submissive (which is likely at this level).

Black also has a big move at S13 if White answers B9. White might want to ignore B9 and play S13 himself, then if Black follows up with B11, White plays S11 with a trade. This kind of exchange of big moves is far better than merely answering submissively - but first you must be certain that ignoring the opponent's big move does not lead to you getting killed!]
