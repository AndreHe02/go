C[Hi reviewer, ;)
JJ: Hi, I'm JJ, the reviewer ^_^

hereby another one of my games. I play Black. I chose this game because of the small difference in score and the fact that no horrid mistakes were made as far as losing groups or chains is concerned.

I am happy with any comments about my opening, feel for direction, tactical and endplay choices.
JJ: Ok, I'll try to comment doing my best.

Here and there i added a comment of my own, or a question about a play.
JJ: I'll try to answer them

Enjoy & good luck.

Pim/Museki];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[jd]C[san ren sei was my standard opening for a while.

JJ: I love this opening, I tried other ones but is the one i like most. I think I'll be able to give you some advices about it ;)

The first one is that this opening is used to make big moyos and a lot of influence upon the center of the board (corners aren't really too important with this kind of opening), so if you like moyos, this is your opening ^_^]
;W[qf]C[JJ: Standard attack];B[qh]C[JJ: Standard response];W[qc]
C[JJ: etc]
(;B[qd]C[JJ: First mistake!!

After you played K16, the correct direction of play was Q17 (see the variation for better explanation).

 If you had played nirensei (only 2 starpoints) then this would be the correct move.]
;W[pc];B[oc]C[JJ: Another mistake, P16 can hurt you a lot];W[rd]
;B[re];W[rc];B[qe]
(;W[ob]C[JJ: Bad move from white. It strengthen your position]
;B[nc];W[nb]C[JJ: Even worst for white, he already was alive and crawls on the second line. He got only 1 point of territory...]
;B[mc]C[JJ: And you at least 6 points of influence];W[cf]C[JJ: I'll put some variations that I think are better responses to this attack]

(;B[ce]TR[dd][pd][cf][qf][qh]C[For the sake of practice I try as many answers to keima kakari as possible.

JJ: This is a GREAT MISTAKE. You can only make this move when you already have a stone about C10 or D10, Â¿ok? (See variation) in any other case you are helping your oponent, and you are not reinforcing your corner as you could think, because later in the game whita still can invade it.]

(;W[df]C[JJ: Good for white];B[bf]C[JJ: Yose move. Your corner still can be invaded]
;W[bg];B[cl]C[Bad timing, i assume.

JJ: Not exactly bad timing, the problem was C15, after that black can't wait a fair result.]

As you can see the exchange is the following: white lives sealed in the corner, and black makes a great wall of influence. 

Now K16 seems to be working very good, don't you think? ;)

Let's see what happens if white repeats the same strategy again.]
