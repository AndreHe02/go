C[[My comments will be in brackets like this one.\]];B[ee]C[[The best move.\]]
;W[gg]C[I start with a standard corner opening
[Black can cut the board in two no matter where White plays. Perhaps White should have played higher, toward the middle.\]]
;B[ge];W[dg]C[I make a two point extension to establish eyespace. I avoid C3 to try and minimize the risk of being cut]
;B[cf];W[cg]C[I block to avoid being barred from the lower left corner
[Maybe White could have played elsewhere like around C7 or around F6\]]
;B[bf];W[bg];B[ag];W[ah];B[af];W[bi];B[df];W[eg]C[I avoid taking E4 because I was concerned black would respond with E3 and I would lose control of the lower half of the board
[White should have played E3.\]];B[ef];W[ff];B[fe];W[hf];B[gf]
;W[fg];B[he]C[[The game is over for White.\]]
(;W[if]C[I4 Is taken because it seemed the only safe way. I5 seemed to inevitably lead to the capture of that group of pieces. A variation is in place to show how I thought it would play out
[You are correct.\]];B[ie];W[hh];B[ec];W[cb]C[I want to secure more territory while avoiding giving black the room to make his own eyes, so i decided to approach the corner low
[Ordinarily, any play in this area by White at this stage of the game would be wasted moves.\]]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[db];W[ca]C[I block the option of surrouding C8]
;B[da];W[ab]C[This blocks a chance to capture two stones if black takes B8]
;B[bd]C[[If Black played B9 instead, White's corner group dies.\]]
;W[ba]C[I was concerned that black would notice the killing move, but he does not. B9 gives the group life.]
;B[cd]
(;W[gb]C[For this move, I contemplated A6 instead to reduce blacks territory a bit. I have a second variation on this move showing how I believe it could have played out. It seemed more useful to make the first move in the right corner instead.
[This will not live.\]];B[ad];W[ac]C[life is secured];B[gc]
;W[hb]C[For this move, my two choices I debated were H7 & H8. Neither seemed to guarantee life, but H8 seemed slightly safer]
;B[fb];W[hc];B[hd];W[ia]C[If this shape was going to live, I9 was the critical point. I wanted to secure it as early as possible]
;B[ic];W[fa]C[Unless black makes mistakes, i believe the shape is dead.]
;B[ea];W[ga];B[id]C[The game is called over at this point. With 3.5 komi, I lose by 2.5 points.]
;W[tt];B[tt]C[[White made Black very strong in the beginning. White should have played more lightly and forced Black into a fight. White will lose moyo games on a small board.\]]
