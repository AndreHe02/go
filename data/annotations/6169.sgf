C[Hi reviewer,

I am Kyle Blocher (linkai) 2-dan from America.  My middlegame is my weakest area and so I tried to create a fighting game to improve it.

Please review for both sides, but I will appreciate any suggestions you have.

I have marked my comments with [kb\].  Thanks for your review.

Kyle

Hi Kyle, My comments start with *];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[cn]
;W[fq]LB[fp:A]C[* Personally I would play F4 (A) but this is probably a matter of taste.]
;B[dj];W[fc]C[* why did you play here, this move gives black the oppertunity to strengthen the corner and leave white with a small group.]

(;B[hc]C[[kb\]: Strange, usually at D17?


* I think D17 is better as well.];W[fe]C[Since black is stong here play C17 immediatly to settle.]
;B[df];W[cc]
(;B[bc]LB[dc:A]C[* Black makes it white to easy to settle himself. A is better. Will give a lot of complicated fights.]
;W[dd];B[ce];W[cb];B[kc];W[qf];B[nc]LB[nd:A]C[[kb\]: This move seems very overconcentrated (and low) on the upper side.

* Black is better to play A (O16)];W[rd]C[[kb\]: When I played this move, I thought it was a mistake in direction.  I thought Q10 as well.]
;B[nq]
(;W[qn]C[[kb\]: Aiming for Q10
* I think better at A (M3), if black plays 3-3.];B[pr];W[qq]
;B[jq]C[[kb\]: Strange extension, but I did not know how to punish it at first.

* It is a bit wide if you think it is too wide play A(M3) before black can strengthen himself.]
;W[bp]LB[jq:A][lq:B]C[* This is a big move but it provokes E6 which is even bigger since it also (indirectly) strengthen the stome at A (K3) Attacking black at B is better.]
;B[en];W[pj]LB[lq:A]C[* Still better at A (M3).];B[nn]LB[no:B]
[np:A]C[[kb\]: I thought I should attempt to take advantage of Black's loose shape here.  What is the best way to do so?

* It is a bit of a vulgar move but either A or B will cut the stone at O6.]

(;W[mp];B[np];W[kp]
(;B[mo]LB[kr:A]C[* This is a mistake A (L2) connects black and it will be very difficult to kill the black group.]
;W[kq];B[hq];W[jr];B[ir];W[jp];B[iq];W[lr];B[ho];W[kn];B[nk]
LB[lm:A]C[* Again a bit wide. Personally I would play A to keep pressure on the white group.]
;W[gn];B[fp];W[gp]
(;B[gq]LB[go:A]C[* At the wrong side. Should be at A. Lot of different possibilities after that.]
;W[eq];B[go];W[fo];B[hp];W[fn];B[hn];W[mm];B[nm];W[ml];B[lo]
LB[gm:D][eo:A][ep:B][gp:C]C[(*) It is hard to kill white when black has 2 weak groups himself. 
Should play A. treatens to connect and cuts white. When white B, black either C or D]
;W[jl]
(;B[im]LB[hl:A]C[(*) Better to jump out with A (H8) white cannot cut.]
;W[jn];B[nl];W[eo];B[jm];W[km];B[hl]LB[il:A]C[(*) Again a move that does not put enough pressure on the white group. Better at A.]
;W[fl];B[em]C[[kb\]: Should be at D8
(*) Not nessesarely, black still has a way out.];W[dk]
(;B[el]LB[ck:A][dl:B]C[(*) Black should play at A or B.];W[ek]
;B[fm];W[gm];B[hm];W[cj]C[(*) Better to get our with the centre group. Black only has one eye, so has to go out.]
;B[kk]C[[kb\]: I did not see this kind of attack coming.

(*) Thisis a strong move. So 74 should have been to get out]

;W[jk];B[kj];W[nr];B[fk];W[gl];B[mr];W[hk];B[il]LB[il:B][js:C]
[ls:A]C[[kb\]: I wondered if I should connect at H10 and see what happens...  Seems like White is behind on liberties.

Winning the ko is big, though, because it threatens the Black dragon now because of O10.

(*) Black cannot connect, should play A, white B and black C. This because the group left will otherwise die.]

;W[qg];B[op];W[sn]LB[ol:A][oq:B][pq:C][qs:D]C[(*) Why play here, A will kill black. Conner. Cannot be killed, with White B, black C, white D, white connect underneath.]
;B[sk];W[sj];B[js];W[ks];B[kr];W[pq];B[oq];W[jr];B[ol];W[is]
;B[on];W[ch]C[[kb\]: I was happy to take sente here.

(*) The game is now hopeless for black. At most black will have 30 points of territory, white territory left corner is more then this.]
;B[cg];W[bh]LB[qc:A][nf:B][of:C]C[(*) To small. Better A or B or C.]
;B[dh];W[of];B[rc]C[[kb\]: This seems like an overplay, but he ends up killing the capturing stones in the end.  Later I could get a ko, but it didn't end up mattering.

I read out that I could cut here because of M10 aji, but I didn't read out that the corner dies, not a ko.]

;W[nh];B[li];W[ng];B[pb]LB[ii:A]C[[kb\]: Ouch.

(*) Black gave away 5 stones and any infuence he had in the centre even a move at A is a treat to black now. I think white is better off, you gave a corner but all other potential territory for black is gone.]
;W[mc]LB[ii:A]C[(*) Better at A. I thibk either the group left or right from the 2 white stones will die.]
;B[nd];W[nb];B[ob];W[md];B[ne];W[me];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg];W[ke]
;B[id];W[if];B[hf];W[ii];B[kg]LB[ig:A]C[[kb\]: Why did Black play here?

(*) I really do not see what black tries to acomplish. His last change is really A and to cut white.]
;W[gk];B[fj];W[gj]C[[kb\]: I wasn't exactly sure how to take advantage of this situation, so I chose the driving tesuji instead to threaten the Black stones at top.  I didn't think I could win a capturing race against the Black dragon below.]
;B[hi];W[hh];B[gi]
(;W[fi]LB[gh:A]C[(*) Better at A, white is connected to either the top group left or right and the 16 black stones are captured.]
;B[gh];W[gg];B[fh];W[fg];B[ei];W[ie];B[ih];W[hg];B[he];W[jd]
;B[jc];W[ig];B[ji];W[eg];B[dg];W[cl];B[bb]C[[kb\]: Definitely should peep at M18, then play G18 to make me play B18 and live.

(*) yes];W[lb];B[gb];W[ib];B[ic];W[fb];B[kb];W[ga];B[gd];W[fd]
C[[kb\]: W+Time, but Black dies here and loses too much on the left side.


(*) Kyle, I did not think you had much problems during the game. It was a pity that you did not take the oppertunities to kill the black group or the 16 stones on the the left side. I think this was the weakest point during your game; you did not kill black.

Black made too many mistakes for you get into trouble and only in the end of the game you had a few slips.]
