C[Dear reviewer!
Thank you for reviewing this game!

My name is Dmitry. I was black in this game and I really have no idea how come I lost it. I had an impression I was leading almost all the game, but eventually I lost 12.5 points.
So it's important for me to understand was it  wrong judgment from the beginning or it just was a point in the game which turned the situation over?
Thx for your comments!

Hello Dmitry!

My name is Frank and I'll be reviewing.

After looking over the game, I think the points for improvement are:
- Don't play ajikeshi moves (as you mentioned in a couple places).  The way that helps is when you see an area with complication, don't immediately try to play everything out.  Wait until you have a plan and can read through the sequence you want to play.  You should try to feel comfortable with the board being complicated.
- Don't get too locked in to the local position - always consider the whole board
- When playing a joseki (or most position for that matter), try to have a plan.  Think about what you will get for a result and what you want to do with it.

My comments are inline.  Hope this helps!

A bit, yes.  It is not clear what black is getting in exchange here and white is only getting stronger.]

This one isn't as bad.  There is not much aji there anyway.  It's more like a wasted ko threat or so.]
