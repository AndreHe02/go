C[Dear Reviewer,

Thanks in advance for your time and effort! I think the most part I am weak with is the early game, the fuseki, I think.]

I don't like this white s15 so much because two reasons:

1) r17 cut is still not possible since black s17 captures the stone.
2) black is aiming at a peep or cut around 15, so although white is trying to build thickness here, it's not so effective.]
;B[qk]C[Truly, I played the avalanche to gain influence. I have played with this opponent a few times, each time he/she tried to prematurely deny any existence of my territory to form in any way, while leaving him/herself open.

Right here maybe I should consider extending and N-16, but I'm not sure. Would appreciate help in handling this situation, thank you :)

Maybe the whole game is crafted out of the right hand upper corner and the variations of the joseki chosen.]

(;W[qm];B[qg]C[wanted to push the weak stone group towards the influence, but I don't know which what is the best way to handle my weak point at Q-15. Maybe I should extend at N-16?

As an opponent, my opponent always plays seemingly overpowered moves like this, I cannot grasp the correct chance to punish him/her.


---------------------------

Maybe due to this black extension, white should have played r7 at r11 instead ?  Then if black extends to r6, white blacks at r5, at which point white has made corner profit and strenghthened above.  I show this in a variation.]
;W[pf]C[Seems a bad choice :(

----------------------

maybe white can protect the cut in more useful ways than q14?  ideas to think about:

1) n17 hane.  Does this white move make the r17 cut severe ?  if black then answers the cut with s17 atari, when white extends to r18 he's threatening two things, both the turn at s28 and the turn at q18.

2) what about hitting on top at q13 ?  not sure but worth thinking about.  

3) an immediate invasion at r11.  You better ask someone stronger than me about this !  (i'm 1k on kgs)]
;B[md];W[oh];B[pi]C[
p12 doesn't seem good because it provokeds q11 which is what black wants anyway.

now that q14 has made the white stones strong, plus white already played r7, i would think about either invasion at r11 , or perhaps even cutting at n17.  Does that cut make the r17 cut a possibility ?  reading needed here !]
;W[nj]C[
once black is settled on right, i don't think o10 needed.  How about taking a big point somewhere else ?]
;B[pg];W[og];B[ok];W[om]C[
It looks like black made a comfortable position both on top and below white's position, so it would be good to see how white could do better here.

The first thing I notice are weaknesses in black's position at n17 and r17, so white should be thinking about how to exploit those weakness (which exploitation may have to happen several moves earlier !)

I'll now go back several moves and look at what white may have done differently that could be better...]
;B[nk];W[oj];B[pj];W[mj];B[mk];W[pl];B[pk];W[mh]C[
seems too conservative.  i would be looking for opportunities to take big moves elsewhere.]
;B[jd]C[Wasn't as bad as expected, but pretty bad.];W[ce];B[nq]
;W[lq]C[
If board were more open, then this white m3 seems good.

However, with strong black wall above, this move could make white too busy.

For example, if black runs away with n4 or presses with m4, then when smoke clears, white will have to both fix the m3 stone plus worry about black invading corner with r3.

For this reason, I think in response to black o3, i would consider white either playing patiently at q3 to protect corner territory in aticipation of black making a base with L3, after which white could go on to next big move, or I'd consider white answer o3 at j3 which allows a base to be made at either f3 or m3.]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[pr]C[
would r3 invasion have made the white corner destablized ?  If so, it might be better than this slide, since the slide may give white sente to make the h3 extension on the bottom.]

;W[hc];B[ic];W[hd];B[ci];W[fq]C[
this small extension seems less valuable than some other possibilities to think about, each of which takes some reading to verify whether it works or not.

1) if white j18 hane, black k18 block, white h18 connect, is it sente ?  In other words, if black does nothing in this are next, can white successfully invade at L17 or clamp at L18 ?    Also, if white plays R17 cut and black ataris at S17 and white cuts at N17, can white make a gain ?  Worth studying...

2) What about white C4 or C7  ?  or even a probe at C3, although I must admit I don't understand such things.

If black answer F3 at C4, white might have lost opportunities here.

A good book on the subject of invading is "Get Strong at Invading", I've been reading it now actually.]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[mr];W[lr];B[mf]C[
this black N14 might not be so good since later a white peep at M15 might activate a white invasion on the top.]
;W[ji]C[
I'm not sure of the timing but white should be thinking about how to use the cuts at N17 and R17 for some gains.

Maybe to prepare for that, white should play O14 instead of K11.]
;B[ln]C[
Since white already answered N2 at M2, white may be able to ignore M6 and take a big move elsewhere.  I'm still wondering about C4 or C7...]
;W[io];B[em]C[
too bad for white.  This move makes the invasion on left side much more difficult.  I don't think J5 was necessary]
;W[cg];B[bh];W[eh]C[
maybe this is too far from h16.    Maybe d11 or g12 instead ?]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[gg]C[Not sure of what I should play now.];W[gi]
C[
what about d9 instead of g11 ?  

Another point to consider is d2.];B[ig]C[

Since black is connected out, white's e12 and g11 aren't doing much so black's invasion seems to be worth more than white's small capture at k18.]
