C[xxc : hi, i'm the reviewer for this game

i have already look the game and can give you this general advice

first, you must study, don't learn anything, if you do not understand it worth nothing and can't help you
training path may be this : fuseki, joseki, shape, endgame
you must study this at a basic and simple level, turn from each part to another and start again this cycle
each part may help you to understand the other ones and this may grant you progress in all parts of the game

from the game, the best advice i can have is "take care of your stones"
this means, have moves that make your stones working well together, connect your stones, do not start an other group before others are safe (or near safe), keep big alive before rescueing small

i'll do the review in this way
stay simple
connect
be safe

this seems a slow path, but it is not possible to get good result from weak moves

i'll show what next move may be

let's go :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq]TR[cn][dn]C[xxc : in following moves, i mark better way to play
and explain at the end of this local fight

white turn, marks are for white move]

SQ[kj][jk][il][hm][gn][fo]C[I guess I probably should have gone to f4 instead.

xxc : yes, better to get outside strong position and leting this cut at f4 is not good

as each player do not want to let anything here, the key point is the line between potential moyos for each side
the other way to settle was to follow a peacefull path (see 5 var 1)]
;W[fp]TR[gp]C[xxc : now white can afford this because corner group is strong and nearly alive]
;B[eo]TR[gp]C[xxc : seems better to forget this stone for now
e5 start an other group to take care and f3 still not strong enough to support it]
;W[do];B[gp];W[fo];B[en];W[go];B[hp];W[ho]TR[el][dn]C[xxc : here is the result
white erase black on the botom and had a perfect target with e6
while g6 still weak];B[cn]C[xxc : do not offer such a cut
escape or stay strong];W[dn]TR[em]C[xxc : of course];B[dm]C[xxc black can't protect both cut]
;W[em];B[fn];W[gm];B[fm];W[el];B[fl]TR[ip]C[I thought I could have lived, and maybe made some center influence with this.

xxc : yes of course, but at what price ?
going on escaping from f8 may endanger too much G4 and kill d7]

xxc  : use your dead group to help g3];W[io];B[im];W[jm];B[hl]
;W[hk]C[I knew that this put me behind by around 24 points, so I felt that I needed to bring the fight somewhere else...

xxc : this is a big loss yes
white now gets a strong group and this one may help allover the board
black ends with loosing central group, weak botom, and weak left

following previous comments may help to prevent this kind of result]

xxc : last chance, but it may be difficult];W[gh]C[I think he was trying to cut me off from joining my lower group here, but I don't see how it would have mattered.... what did he think of this move?

xxc : white may push black toward her strengh];B[id]C[I felt that grabbing territory from the top would be the safest, and attempting to live there could either cut my chance to victory or cut his lead.]

;B[eg];W[ff];B[fg]C[And around the time I finished this move after transfering it from Yahoo! Go, the server crashed on me, and I was booted. What happened next is that I took a lot of the top left corner, but his group was mostly intact, and we engaged in a ko fight in the bottom left, leaving me with most of the corner. Then, we turned to the top where I had that side, and I established a stronger hold, pushing down into his territory around the h11 area. He boxed me out, and then toward the end, I take his top right corner pieces. The score ended up 109 v 108.5. I know I could have done better. Thanks for the review.

It's like....
somehow I managed to force his shape in the top left to yield him only around 6 territories, while occupying an additional 8 or nine from my wall extension from the bottom. Undoubtedly, I killed the C13 group. and a nasty ko fight occurred over j14 and k14, which he eventually took hold of.


xxc : overall comment
it seems that white get better result in making her stones work together in this game

black may follow safer way from the beginning
start a group and give it strong shape before anything else

help your weak stones this way
enlarge eyeshape before searching life
fly toward your stones to connect if possible

when all your group are strong
target a weak point to start another one
threat weak opponent stone or group
enlarge your framework

thank u])
(;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]C[xxc : this is ok for both
simple, peacefull and strong]))
