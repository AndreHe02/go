[dm:5][pm:2][gp:4][mp:3]C[Ok, I know you shouldn't submit games in which you won by alot of points, but since starting to play on KGS I have been playing alot more handicap games than I did on IGS.  
(RickMott: Yes, that's why I like
it better. :)

So I would like any advice you can give me regarding them I would love to hear it.

Misc. Question:  In a 9h game what can you do when your opponent starts playing moves like the ones I have listed?

RickMott: I'm not going to quote joseki books everywhere, party because I'm not that strong on joseki and partly because you will do better to focus on broader strategies, I think.

In a high-handicap game, white must cut off and capture many stones in order to win.  Therefore, white will play a fighting game from the start.

Black, given a large initial advantage, can afford not to play for every last point of territory, but can simply focus on staying connected and making life.  If white makes an overplay and you get to attack, great, but that's not his aim.  Black wants to keep it simple.  Remember the proverb "rich men don't start fights".  If no big groups die, black will win.]
;W[mc]LB[nc:B][oc:A]C[I find this to be a common starting place for 9h games.  However ones like B and A also are common.  Which do you prefer to get started, or do you do something entirely different?  If possible, I know this is asking alot, but could you should some various Josekis for 9h games?

RickMott: well, white has to play somewhere and wait for you to make a mistake.  I like B better because it provides the option of the slide at Q18, corner R17, jump at O15 or extension to L17 depending on black's response.  But it's hard to say for sure.  This move assumes white will attack either black's K or Q line stone eventually.]
;B[nc]LB[md:A][me:B]C[I often see A as a more common response for black.  Is Blacks move a a bad move?  Personally, I would play at B with the intent of containing white.

RickMott: As a rule of thumb, it's better not to contact a weak stone.  Therefore, I also like the play at B.  But none of these is bad in itself; it's the followup that matters.]
;W[nd];B[od]C[RickMott: This seems like a mistake.  Black should stay connected with P17.]
;W[nb]C[RickMott: I might have cut at P17 instead.  You would either make a base on the top or get outside strength in sente which would help in attacking black's top center stone later.]
;B[oc];W[ne]LB[md:A]C[Geez I'm playing pretty careless giving black a great opportunity to cut.

RickMott: Yes, I think black should cut at A to separate white.  White should have connected solidly and then played to separate the D16 and K16 stones.]
;B[oe];W[kc]C[RickMott: Still doesn't protect the cutting point.]
;B[jc]C[RickMott: Black is playing very solid, trying to confine White.  This is a good strategy.]
;W[qg]C[RickMott: This is fine; black's shape is not so good and leaves the corner open, so you invade where you can threaten either to escape into the center or slide into the corner.  Good thinking.]
;B[qf];W[og];B[pf]C[RickMott: A little slow; if black wanted to protect the corner, maybe hane underneath at S13 is better.]
;W[nf]C[RickMott: I think you have to connect at Q13.  It's very good for black to push through there.]
;B[of]C[RickMott: But he doesn't do that, so you get away with it.  :)  Black's move is not necessary; he should have pushed and cut at Q13]
;W[ng];B[ob]C[RickMott: push and cut at Q13 is much better for black.]
;W[na];B[oa];W[mb]C[RickMott: Locally, this sequence ends in gote for white and locks out the potential for an endgame hane at P19.  Better to connect solidly at N18 in the first place instead of descending to O19.

But you should still connect at Q13.  You have built this big wall facing black's two strong stones; your influence is greatly reduced.

Black has two reasonable choices now.  He can play F17 if he's worried about a white invasion, or push through at Q13.]
;B[qc]C[Don't really think that was necessary, right?

RickMott: Right.  You can't possibly invade and hope to live in there, and you can't prevent black from making eyes.  But intimidation plays a big role in high handicap games, otherwise he wouldn't need 9 stones... :)]
;W[rf]C[RickMott: Black should ignore this and still push through.  Even you connect so he can't cut at R13, he would get a good result.]
;B[re]C[RickMott: But he takes the safe route, which is not unreasonable in a high-handicap game.  White can get away with some overplays and expect black will probably respond, but it's a bad habit; some day someone's going to call your bluff. :)]
;W[rg]
(;B[se]C[RickMott: Not necessary; I can't see what black is
worried about here.  The push is still good (see variations) or black could make a bigger move somewhere else.]
;W[mq]C[RickMott: I like the small knight's move approach at O3 better, because I think it has more good followup moves.  I looked in Ishida's joseki dictionary, and in MasterGo (searchable database of pro games) and did not find any games using the large knight's move.]
;B[np]C[Another strange response to my attack.  Another mistake?

RickMott: It's unusual, but not ridiculous in a high-handicap game because of all the supporting black stones nearby.  Black wants to confine white to a small life on the side or in the corner.]
;W[mp];B[nq]C[RickMott: but this is a bad followup for black.  He should hane on top, give white the bottom, and take the outside.]
;W[qm]C[RickMott: This is not good (although you may get away with it against a much weaker opponent).  You will create two weak groups.  Black is strong in the corner and the Q10 stone can escape easily, so you don't have a good attack against it.]
;B[pn]C[Again...

RickMott: Not a bad response, actually, although capping at P7 would probably be better.  Black should be thinking about keeping the white groups separated and confined.]
;W[pm];B[qn]C[RickMott: This is a classic weak player problem.  He is determined to keep the corner, when he should be aiming at a splitting attack on you.]
;W[on]LB[om:A]C[Cant be giving him all these places to cut in a 9h game.

RickMott: yes.  If he cuts, now you have 3 weak groups to look after.]
;B[oo]C[RickMott: Black is really letting you push him around here.  Much too passive.]
;W[nn];B[nj]C[RickMott: So now he gets worried about his side stone.  He should probably cut at N5.  You are too weak to threaten this stone seriously, with the weakness at Q13 and the cut at P7 as aji for black.]
;W[rj];B[qj]C[RickMott: This is a good move for black.  Since the Q13 push is still open, he has great aji, but I'm afraid he doesn't know how to use it.]
;W[qk]
(;B[pk]C[It is interesting how this all turned out. ^_^

RickMott: Black's move was too gentle.  If he hanes at S11, he can do much better.  See variation.]
;W[ql];B[rn];W[oj]C[RickMott: This is too aggressive, I think.  Black can still hane at S11 and push/cut at Q13.]
;B[ok];W[oi];B[nk]C[RickMott: Black should make the tiger's mouth connection at O8 instead, which threatens to cut at P7.  Actually, the P7 cut is still possible.  So is the hane/push/cut sequence we discussed before.  Your attempted wedge at P10 didn't fix any of your weaknesses and make black stronger.  But maybe you can bluff again and play M10 now.]
;W[lj]C[RickiMott: Would you believe I typed that last comment before looking at this move?  I did.
You have way to many weaknesses to try this now, and locally, this stone is weaker than its black neighbors.]
;B[lk]C[RickMott: but black responds locally too.];W[kk];B[mj]
C[RickMott: Black should extend down at M8 instead.  He has plenty of potential splitting attacks against your lower right stones, and you still can't cut though at N9.]
;W[ll];B[mk];W[li]C[RickMott: Are you relly going to get away with this?!?!?!]
;B[kj]C[RickMott: Looks like you will.];W[kl]
(;B[ml]C[RickMott: Terrible.  Forces a response that's idea for white.  Many winning sequences for black; see variations.]
;W[ln];B[mm];W[mn];B[jk];W[kn]C[RickMott: Black has helped you remove all the threats to your bottom stones, in addition to assisting in his own capture.  He's being very nice to you...]
;B[rm];W[rl];B[sm];W[qi]C[RickMott: and now the last real threat for black is gone.  So you did get away with it, but be wary of playing so aggressively against someone stronger (or even against vorcksek1 again, if he reads this and brushes up on cutting/connecting tesuji.. :)]

(;B[qq]C[RickMott: Probably not needed, but black also probably does not know how to use his strength here to prevent a 3-3 invasion from making life.  See variations.]
;W[nr];B[or];W[ns];B[os];W[mr]C[RickMott: This should be saved for an end-game sequence because it ends in gote for white.]
;B[kp]C[RickMott: this move doesn't help black much.  He should play somewhere like G3 or G4 instead.]
;W[kq]C[RickMott: white should invade around F3, aiming either to take away most of the corner or capture the two black stones on a large scale.  White need not make eyes since he can capture the O9 black group.]
;B[jq];W[kr];B[jr]C[RickMott: This seqence helps black much more than white.]
;W[lp];B[ko];W[im]C[RickMott: this is a big move because a white play here creates a huge moyo.]
;B[hj]C[RickMott: but this is probably not the best response.  Black shouldplay around G5 to make something in the bottom left.]
;W[gq]C[RickMott: Might be too deep.  Black could cap at G5 and you may have a hard time livlng.]
;B[fq]C[Yet another strange response from black.

RickMott: Yes, G5 or H5 would have been better.];W[gp];B[fp]
C[RickMott: Black has to get out of this habit.  He made this move in two previous corners. The corners are not important for black in a handicap game, believe it or not.  He can let white live in all four corners and win easily by getting big outside influence.  In this sequence, the corner is overconcentrated and he will lose the K-line group.]
;W[cm]C[RickMott: But you give him a chance to save himself here!  If he hanes at G5, how can you save your stones?]
;B[cn]C[RickMott: Fortunately for you, black can be relied on to respond locally to any approach to a corner, no matter how urgent the threat elsewhere... :)]
;W[em];B[en];W[fk];B[fj];W[gj]C[RickMott: Both players continue to ignore the urgent move at the bottom left. Either side can kill the other.  Both of you are making moves in an area which shouldn't be territory for either of you.]
;B[gi];W[gk];B[ij]C[RickMott: Black does not need to leave a cutting point at H11; making a double tiger's mouth with J11 would be better.]
;W[fi];B[hi];W[ej];B[ki]LB[if:C][jf:D][ig:B][jg:A]C[I probably should have played somewhere in that area around now to keep him from gaining that large territory in the top.

RickMott:  Possibly, alhough there may be some risk from the various cutting points in your shape. The move you actually made removes a lot of aji for black.]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[mi];B[kg]C[RickMott: and he has this sequence anyway, which would probably let him attack the stone you played on the K or J lines.  If you jump into black's moyo with F13 now, it will be greatly reduced.]
;W[lg];B[kf]C[RickMott: Misses the important point for black. F12 or F13 would be bigger locally.  But the really important point for both sides is G5.]
;W[kh];B[jh];W[cq]C[RickMott: There isn't much room for white to live here, with black's tight double wing.  What black should do now in any event is ignore this and hane at G5.  If he does so, he will be far ahead.]
;B[cp];W[fr];B[eq]C[RickMott: This is bad for black.  He must hane at E2.  This both gives up the corner and eliminates any chance of saving the K1-K4 group.]
;W[er];B[go]C[RickMott: Right idea, too late.];W[dq];B[bq]C[RickMott: black can make two eyes immediately with E5 and threaten to play either this move or connect to the K-line bottom group next.]
;W[fo];B[ep]CR[gp][cq][dq][gq][er][fr]C[I think black could have killed this territory fairly easy.

RickMott: Several moves earlier, yes, but not now.];W[fn];B[ho]
;W[br];B[bp];W[ir]
(;B[io]C[RickMott: Black has two weak groups here, and he's trying to save the wrong one.  This group has no base and no eyes, and (before he adds this one) it's only 7 stones.  The corner group has a base and can make eyes easily (see variations).]
;W[hq];B[iq];W[is];B[js];W[hr];B[jn];W[jm];B[hm];W[hl];B[gm]
;W[fm];B[jl];W[il];B[lm];W[km]C[RickMott: these are all hopeless plays by black, but at least they are mostly sente.  He should save them for ko threats, though.]
;B[gl];W[hk]C[RickMott: You do not need to answer here.  It would be better to attack black's corner group with a hane at B6.]
;B[dm];W[dl];B[dn];W[cl];B[bm];W[bl];B[bn]C[RickMott: This is a mistake. Black should descend to the edge at A7 to enlarge his eye space.]
;W[eo];B[do];W[am]C[^_^];B[an];W[aq];B[ap];W[bo]C[RickMott: well played by white.  Do you see that if black had played A7, this wouldn't have worked?]
;B[ar];W[bs];B[al];W[ak];B[am];W[bk];B[cj];W[ei];B[dh];W[ce]
C[RickMott: Ok, i'm stopping the review here.  Once white kills both groups in the lower left, black cannot win.  The details of how much he loses by are not interesting.

The key insight for black is to avoid trying to make territory with the corner handicap stones.  Use them as support for fighting.  Keep white separated and be careful about your own connections, and you should win more high-handicap games.

For white, you generally played well, but you left a lot of weaknesses hanging which would have gotten you in trouble against a stronger opponent.  You have to stretch for more than you "deserve" when giving a handicap, but avoid extreme overplays.  Just wait for your opponent to make a mistake, and then capitalize on it.

Also, you should drop the large knight's move approach in favor of the small knight's move.]

(;B[gm]C[RickMott: I think this group can be saved starting with this move, but it's not worth it; black gives up the corner and lower side, a much bigger loss.
