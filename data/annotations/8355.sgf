Osvaldo: Dear Reviewer, I really appreciate you taking the time to review my game.  I played black, and this is a tournament game.  I think this game represents pretty well how I generally play, so I would really appreciate any general advice on mistakes I made or what aspects of my game I should really work on.  This is my first review on GTL.. what a great site!! Anyways, thanks again.-Dave

N:  
And glad to be a small part of this great site ;-)
It seems you made a few times mistakes involving the balance between weak and strong groups. Better realizing what groups are weak or strong and acting accordingly could help you improve I think.
You also made a mistake in the lower left with big consequences and you missed a very fine move on the top right. Finally the game was lost because you chose to take the corner instead of reducing the center.
My comments will be preceded by N:
Kind regards,

;B[ql];W[on];B[nq];W[oj];B[rp]C[Osvaldo: In restrospect I'm wondering if s4 is maybe too slow at this point.  I was thinking about d15 instead, but I wanted to make his r6 group uncomfortable.  But obviously since he didnt respond and I didnt follow up, s4 wasnt much of a sente play..

N: slow but also solid and big.  Normally your opponent would play here so as he didn't, it shouldn't be too bad to play there yourself.]
;W[jd];B[cf];W[cd]
(;B[ci];W[jq]C[Osvaldo: would it have been wise to jump out with q7 then o8?

N: looks like there is some bad adji there for white. However it feels a bit soon for me to play there. More urgent to me is c6 because W c9 is also very big and almost sente.]
(;B[oh];W[mj]
(;B[mo]C[Osvaldo: was this a good move? I had a good feeling about it at the time because I wanted to separate whites two groups.. but now i see the sequence is gote for me, and ultimately i kind of reinforced both of whites groups

N: looks like bad shape to me. Also this does not seem urgent. If white would play here, he can get some influence, but nothing dramatic. I think there are many better moves.]
;W[mn]C[N: this is a very easy way to reinforce for white];B[ln]
;W[mm];B[lo];W[gq]
(;B[cp]C[Osvaldo:  This is a somewhat experimental move for me.  I have only played it a few times before, but it seemed right for this situation.  of course i was hoping that he would give me the outside, so that I could link up harmoniously with my c11 stones.. but when he chose to give me the corner, i found myself a bit unsure how to proceed.  what did I do wrong?  and would c6 have been better instead?

N: as far as I know, this move is more common if white also has a stone around c10. Right now, jumping in the corner seems more annoying for white.]
(;W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[cq];W[bn]
(;B[bq]C[N: I think this is a serious mistake. You have a chance to try to run out instead of living in the corner. By giving this atari first, you make it far easier for your opponent.]
;W[ao];B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[aq]C[N: now you end in gote]
;W[ck];B[ei];W[dh];B[ch];W[oe]C[Osvaldo:  Starting here is where I felt that I started to fall behind.. I could figure out how to effectively react to the p15 stone.. r14 was tempting but seemed too passive]
(;B[lc]C[N: not logic, wrong direction, it allows white to split your stones. Also it  does not put pressure on white]
;W[md];B[mc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[rd];W[pg];B[ph];W[re]C[Osvaldo: I thought that from p15 to here was quite a good sequence by white

N: dramatic for black. You were strong and now you have tree heavy weak stones]
;B[mh];W[ki];B[kh];W[lg];B[lh];W[df]
(;B[ld]C[N: you are already strong on that side, I would play a move from the side of your weak group first]

(;B[jb]C[N: this seems too soft. The white group is not so strong so you should try to be more severe]
;W[ic];B[hb];W[ib];B[ia];W[kb];B[kc];W[jc];B[ja];W[mq]C[N: sharp move, seems difficult to counter. This also illustrates n5 was not an ideal shape]

(;B[qq]C[N: better take sente];W[ri];B[lm]C[Osvaldo: In restrospect I see that i shouldnt have pushed here if i wasnt going to immediately jump into the j8 area]
;W[ml];B[bk];W[cl];B[be];W[bd];B[ad];W[ac];B[ae];W[cj];B[bj]
;W[di];B[bc]C[Osvaldo:  perhaps here (if not before) a move around j8 would have been better don't you think?

N: yes that area seems bigger. Also, a move overthere will be sente, because it will have a good follow-up.]

(;B[im]C[Osvaldo: starting here, this sequence ended up just losing points for me.. was there some way to take advantage of the wide spacing between j9 and j6 and erode his moyo?
