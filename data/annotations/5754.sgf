C[MadMonzer [17k\]: Hello and good luck
oneavg [18k\]: hi, gl

Review requested by MadMonzer (white).  I thought I played reasonably well for 17k,


[lightest 10K\] glad to do this review.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[do]
C[Not sure why I played here - is it worse than the hoshi point or just different?

[lightest 10k\]
no worse - it depends on white side (your) characteristic.
Hoshi opening doesn't get any point 'directly', but it has influence to two sides and even to the center. Here white 4 has influence to the left side and declare even less point at the corner. But this is not my favor choice, since black 3 did have some influence to the left, and your are just the "later sharer". But it  doesn't mean that white 4 is bad. In fact there are also many joseki's about this 5-4 point. If you are familiar with it but not so as your opponent, you may take advantage.]

[lightest 10K\]According to white 4, I think you may go like this[see variation\]]

(;W[pr]C[[lightest 10K\]why white 12? wanna kill black? may you review some of the josekii about hoshi openings.]

Of course, my stones above black are weak, which cost me.  Can I kill at this point?

[lightest 10K\]No. Providing black plays at R5 imediately.]
