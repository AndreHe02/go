C[Dear reviewer,

thx in advance for reviewing my game and helping me to get stronger!

To make it easier for you I have detailed questions you just need to follow. Of course if you see big mistakes or necessity to explain things, feel free to mention it.

I played with black....];B[pd]C[rs220675 [1k\]: hi];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[cd];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qn]C[That move isn't joseki, but how do I punish this move most effectively? My next move will be R4 - is that the best?]
;B[qp];W[pk]C[Here I was puzzled. Obviously my opponent wanted to play "light". My next move here was at R8. Is that ok or why not and what should I have answered (maybe a little sequence would be nice in this case that I get a feeling for this situation)?]
;B[ql];W[on];B[np];W[qj];B[pl];W[mn];B[lo]C[Is that move ok to keep pressure on the white weak group or is it too ineffective? If that's the case: where should I have played instead?

klin: B can be happy with the N6-M5 exchange.];W[qg];B[ok]C[I wanted to isolate the weak white group around N6 and avoid isolation of my own 3 stones around Q8...just as an explanation for this move. Is that strategy ok?]

;W[il];B[ng];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob]C[klin: Black P18 should choose R16.]
;W[qb];B[oc];W[re]C[klin: White has saved the R13 group.];B[ld]
C[Is that move alright or not? Where should I have played? I was anxious to get some territory in exchange for letting white live on the right upper side.

klin: M16 not good.  Black's group is too strong here.  Should play around H16 to attack.]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[This move seems a bit odd for me. Was it correct and please see the following sequence and tell me if it's ok for black or how it should have gone instead....

klin: H17 is little bit too late.  Should play at the left side, for example C11.]
;W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[jc];W[gc];B[kd]C[klin: Black got gote here.]
;W[dr];B[er]C[This move always bothers me. Because obviously it's a small move, but on the other side I have always fear that white could use the stone at D2 for a deep invasion around H3. Was this move ok or where would have you played?

klin: Apparently, C11 or D11 is still good.];W[eq];B[ep]C[klin: This is bad.  Should F2 connect, and leave something in the corner.]
;W[dq];B[fp];W[ck]C[This is the very first time I realized a problem for my black side: White had a big moyo on the left upper side and it seemed there is no real possibility for me to invase there anymore.

klin: White C9 is not as good as D11.];B[jm];W[jl];B[kk];W[kl]
;B[hm]C[Now this move I consider as a mistake since it will strengthen whites thickness and white will be able to espace with its weak group. I consider a move around F8 better. Am I right? If the move at H7 is indeed ok, then please look at the following sequence and tell me how could I have put more pressure on white or gotten out of this "escape-run" with more advantage.

klin: At this moment, Black should choose between D10 or E10.  C15 is another way to invade.]

;W[el];B[fm];W[em];B[fn];W[ej]C[klin: The black sequence accomplished nothing but help white.
