C[Dear Reviewer,

   I genuinely enjoyed this particular game.  Here, I've lost a reasonably
close game against an opponent who usually beats the devil out of me.

  Getting up into the middle of the game, I felt really confident..
However, I just couldn't get the job done.   Your comments will be dearly
appreciated.

Regards, redeye
(6k*)];B[pc]C[Hi redeye,
I will try to comment extensively. I will not look ahead in the game before writing the comments, so you can see what I consider important without hindsight. But remember I am only amateur 3d...
:-)];W[cp];B[qe];W[dc];B[pp];W[nq];B[kp];W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[on]
;W[qq];B[qo];W[qm];B[ro];W[pq]C[W went wrong here. if he wanted the corner, better without the R7-s5 exchange, that costs points in the corner but more importantly makes the R7 stones heavy and subject to attack.]
;B[qj]C[Q10 seems a somewhat better point to attack. W sliding under at S10 is not so effective because of S5 stone, and B is happy to let him live small on the side, in gote. now after W push at P7 he has a nice cap P10.]
;W[pk]C[helping B to get an 'iron pillar' should be avoided, especially against the shimari. B can push twice then jump to N5 or M5, and W is still without a base, B in the clear, and W paid heavily in side territory for B.]
;B[pj];W[ok];B[lq]C[1. B should push once more at Q10.  2. M3 is a nice point to attack the corner, but here it is better to connect B's forces around N5. W has to get his running group outso B can aim at M3 later. Now W has a chance to split B's forces, complicating the situation.
When you are in advantage, play straightforward.];W[mo]C[this is too thin, B can cut through. this means that W fails th seperate B. N3 is so much better : not only it seperates B, it also defends against P2, which means the corner is alive - extremely big difference.]
;B[nm];W[oj]C[see how this push makes life easier for W.];B[oi]
;W[ni];B[oh];W[mk];B[lm];W[op]C[necessary. W lost almost a whole stone here.]
;B[kl]C[aggressive, emphasizes chasing W; but W can play L5 to seperate B. in a running fight, connect your group securely when you can - this worth more than it seems.]
;W[ko]C[good, W leaps at the chance.];B[jo];W[jp]C[W is behind and is going for complications, but this is overplay. see variation. B should not give atari on L5 but go for K4. If B L6 atari first, W can connect to the corner.]

(;B[lo]C[what for ? beware of taking sente for no purpose.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[ip];B[kn]C[this is over-concentrated. compare : when you played L8, you could have played L6, be perfectly secure and not help W get territory at the bottom. now W P7 is sente, which makes W alive already.
next you can push at O12 and take K17 so you still some lead, but W answers at D10 and is well in the game.]
;W[eq];B[de]C[problem - W can pincer and build his side. your thickness is a little to far to be very effective in invading the side later. wedging around C10 looks better. but better yet - push at O12 and take K17, making use of your upper-right potential.
notice the shift in power that pushing moves like Q10 and O12 create for the first player who takes them.]
;W[cg]C[see var.]
(;B[ef]C[How about the variation instead ?];W[fc];B[dh];W[ch]
;B[di];W[ce];B[cd];W[be];B[dd];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[ac];W[cj]
;B[dj];W[ci]C[slack, W should C9 of course.
Now whether to press at c9 or play around L17 is tough decision. (C9 need not be afraid of D9 cut).]
;B[mg]C[gote! push !
besides, now is a good time for a H3 move, using your A17 stone for more than endgame. always consider the stones already on the board and try to make them work to their maximum. after N13, W solidifies his group while undercutting your moyo, maybe with the help of P17 etc. first.]
;W[ic];B[rl]C[this is a move meant to kill. don't play those unless you are quite sure you can make the kill, or that trying does not waste your assets. there is always the question whether to press from outside or slide low to take eyespace.
in this case, the decision is easy : as I said, W can live easily because P7 is sente, but he is better off running outside erasing your hard-earned thickness on the left. imagine a stone at L11 - getting 15-20 pts in the center will get you in the lead.
let's get some order into the position assessment :
B has some 40 pts on the top right, 50-55 if he gets N17. L11 is probably sente against W's group, but I am not sure. Big difference if it is. Try out variations for W ignoring L11. assuming W defends, next B D8 (not C9 as W will cut at D8, both B and W will live, but the group growing from D8 will erase your sente - not worth it ). W can further extend into the upper side but B will get forcung moves like h16, helping his senter. B also has G3. looks like
an easy win. However if W ignores L11, plays D9 and survives B's attack following, W leads, but not decisively. W's next important points are Q18 and D9. in this huge decision point, S8 is way too small. W should P7 (B can respond at S7) then play L10, and looking good.]
;W[li];B[kg];W[ji]C[daggers slicing the center potential.];B[hi]
C[no use attacking W any more. M17, or D8. probably D8 as it also protects your now weak group E14, except erasing W's area on the left.]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[jk]C[W is too careful - he is alive, and helps B now build a wall. after L13 is in place B can answer Q18 at P17 and be satisfied, so P17 is the probe for now. D9 still huge. K9 worthless.]
;B[ik];W[ij];B[hj];W[jg];B[jf];W[ig];B[gp]C[good thinking, after W helped B get potential ter around H7, G4 makes use of it. However, B ends in gote and W got the bottom after G3.]
;W[go]C[W is reluctant to give B the center so sacrifices the 2 stones, B will take them in goteand W take D9. not a bad plan.]
;B[fp]C[dangerous ! take the sacrifice (by H4), then after W D9 B M17 you lead.]
;W[hp]C[H5 stronger. this loses for sure.];B[fo];W[fn]C[B H5 W G6 B J6 enough.]
;B[gn]C[risky... don't know what will happen. but this kind of gamble (you may end up totally captured) is for desperate times. taking the sacrifice then M17 would give you a lead.]
;W[ho];B[en];W[fm];B[gm];W[em];B[ep]C[very bad, W can next connect his isolated group. D5 gives you a better chance - you need to pick up 6 liberties or better.]
;W[dp];B[dn]C[now W G3 and over, see var.
It may seem long but actually not difficult to read as most moves are one-way.]
