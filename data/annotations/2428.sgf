;B[pp]C[Hi, I'm Darrell.  I'm about 6 kyu at a local club.

After
a quick glance at the game, the most obvious thing I see is that you
hang on much too tightly to small amounts of profit and/or unimportant
stones. 
Give these up and take something bigger in return.  Watch for this as you play.  You will be amazed.]
;W[dd];B[dq];W[pd];B[pf]LB[do:a][co:b]TR[pd]C[The most valuable place to play at this point is around 'a' or 'b'.

Because the marked stone is on the 4-4 point, a "symetrical" point, an approach to this is less important than an]
;W[jp]LB[do:a][co:b]C[I was suprised by this move.  I usually start by taking 
two corners then attacking.  Is it better to take the 
sides? And did I respond well?

D:
Well, the same comment is true for white.  The most valuable point on
the board is still around 'a' or 'b', so I think this was a
less-than-ideal move.];B[lp]C[This is a fine response.  It does two
things:  it takes away one of the directions the white stone can flee,
which makes it an attack, plus it is an extension from your corner.]
;W[pj];B[qd];W[pe];B[qe];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[pg];W[rb]C[White
is threatening to take a single stone.  It is not an important stone. 
If you give it up, you will gain two moves elsewere for a cost of one
stone.  See variation for example.]
(;B[re]LB[qf:a]C[I realize I should have played this move at s17 
instead

D:
Well, if you answer white at all, I like it the way you played it. 
This way it adds some strength to the cutting point at 'a'.]
;W[sc]C[This
is a very small move.  Again, You should just ignore it.  Look at it
this way:  White is going to invest two moves to capture one
unimportant stone.];B[rd]LB[mg:a][ql:b][gp:c]C[Instead, you make a
dumpling (shapeless pile of stones).  Instead, moves like these would
have been very valuable.];W[oc];B[ri]LB[qh:a]C[I wanted to make sure i grabbed some of this corner 
territory. 

D:  Hanging on to territory is your lowest priority at this point in the game.  See initial comments.  

Besides
that, this diagonal shape is very awkward.  White can play at 'a' and
you cannot connect so your move does not secure the territory anyway.]
;W[rj]C[White helps you make the move look better than it was.]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[pi];W[oi];B[hp]C[Very good.];W[jr]TR[hp][lp]
[pp]C[I
didn't expect the jump down and as you will see I lost left side
territory and a few stones. Where did I go wrong? Which of the upcoming
moves were 
unneccessary or better played elsewhere?

D:  You
have mostly been playing on the 4th row.  The 4th row is very poor for
capturing the side, but instead aims for influence into the center.  It
is expected that white can live on the edge in a situation like this,
but you should gain a very nice wall on the outside to use over the
rest of the board.];B[hr]C[Good.  You strengthen your corner while
limiting white's ability to make a base in that direction.  Profit
while attacking.];W[lq];B[mq];W[kp];B[lo];W[mr];B[lr];W[kq]
;B[nr];W[kr];B[ms];W[ko];B[ln]TR[pj][qj][rj]C[So
far, you are getting an excellent result.  You are profiting in the
lower left and the lower right.  Also, white's marked stones are
getting weaker and weaker.];W[io];B[ho];W[dj];B[dl];W[pn];B[qn]
;W[fm];B[fl]LB[ql:a][oj:b]C[Here I was trying to keep him from connecting the 
bottom to the left top side.  

D:  Ok.  Not a bad idea.  

Alternately,
a move around 'a' would have left the 3 white stones on the right with
no eye space, plus would give you profit.  White would have to defend
the cutting point urgently.];W[hm]C[At this point, white has two weak groups.  If you can keep them split apart, you should do well.  See variation 2.]

(;B[gl];W[gm];B[ej]C[I didn't think he would be able to stop me from 
connecting
h2 and company from the left side which is why I attacked. I thought
that by playing this move I could gain invluence to middle.

D:  Seems reasonable.];W[eo]LB[fp:a]C[Now priority #1 comes into play.  Defend any weak groups.]

;B[en];W[gp]C[Losing
these stones hurts a bit, but you've actually made pretty good profit
on the left and still looking great on the right.];B[di]C[Good.  Take advantage of his ignoring E10.]

;W[ff];B[ge];W[fe];B[gd];W[fd];B[gc];W[fc];B[nc]LB[lc:a]C[Was this too aggressive?

D:
Yes,  You are playing right up against very very very strong white
stones.  There is no possible way for this to be a good thing.  An
extension from your wall is urgent, so you have the right idea.  I
would put it at 'a'.  You have no slightest possiblity of attacking the
white group, so move it in close enough to your wall to make some
profit.];W[nd];B[oe];W[od];B[mc];W[ne]LB[le:a]C[Ignore this.  It is
just one unimportant stone.  White is offering you a nice gift if he
invests two moves to capture it.];B[of];W[ii]C[Again, you could
just sacrifice these stones.  They are not separating weak white groups
or supporting any of your groups or even building territory.  They are
just not important.  See variation 2.]

;B[lh];W[ni];B[lk]C[You are playing up against white's thickness.  The go proverb is "stay away from thickness."]
;W[mj];B[nl]TR[hk][hj][hi][ij][jj]LB[ql:a]C[Because
the marked stones are dead, there is no way to threaten the white wall.
Just take some profit.

A move at 'a' is best.];W[lm];B[km]LB[mm:a]C[You must respect that huge white wall.  It is very powerful.]

better moves leading up to this?

D:  Realistically, this should not work.  When you played moves 97 through 103, you pretty much gave white the corner.
