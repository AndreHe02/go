C[I think the more important thing for you right now is:
If you notice that the opponent's territory is getting much bigger than yours, then play inside that territory. Do nut push on the border, because it will not be enough. Invade right away. It's more difficult because it's always a little frightening to play inside ennemy territory, and at the beginning you may lose some games until you find out how and when to invade efficiently, but in the long run it will definitely help your game to try.]

(;B[dd]C[Playing like that just between two enemy stones is often bad, because it's just calling for an atari. So the question is, what is the purpose of this move? Some questions you might want to ask yourself:
1. Can you separate the two white stones by playing it?
2. Do you need to separate the two white stones?
3. What will be your shape after the exchange?

I'd have rather tried something like E4, trying to isolate G4 and link up your E5 and C3 stones at the same time.]
;W[cd];B[ed];W[gd];B[ec];W[ef]C[In this position, white is very vulnerable. Its shape is full of weaknesses you can use. On the other side, black is a little cramped and need to develop more.The move you play next, at F4, does not make use of white's weaknesses. It even helps white to strenghten its position. Let's look at some other moves you could have tried...]
(;B[ff]C[That's the second time you're playing that move. By playing this way, you're helping white to separate your group from the lonely black stone at C3. Again, in general you should not play like this between two enemy stones when you have no true chance to separate them, except in the end game when you want to push a little the enemy territorry.]
;W[fg];B[fe];W[dg]C[Now white is beginning to strengthen a little its position, but there's still some fun stuff to do if you take advantage of the remaining weaknesses.]
(;B[ge];W[cf];B[db]C[You play too small. I think being more agressive would help you here.]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[bb]
(;B[bc];W[bd];B[ba];W[ac];B[hf]C[You keep pushing white on the borders, but by doing that you also make those borders stronger. And it's not in your interest to do that , because those borders give 2/3 of the board to white. Right now you very badly need that C3 stone to live, so it's urgent to help it. The more you push white on the border, the stronger white gets in the area, and the harder it becomes for you to win.]

But at the very least, it would be very, very tough. It's pretty late at that point to try to save that black stone, you should have tried something like that earlier in the game, before white was too strong in the area.]
