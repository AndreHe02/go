;W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[dp];W[do];B[cq];W[bq]L[co]C[jlee: What is  the joseki here?
reid: Good question!  I just looked in Ishida's "Basic Dictionary of Joseki  Vol 2" (page 108) where it says that b3 is a trick play. The correct  response seems to be to cut at C5]

(;B[dr];W[bo]L[cr]C[reid: i think w  should atari at c2 first...];B[cn]
C[reid: b c6 seems to me to be just a bit  aji-keshi. the d7 stone is pretty much a sacrifice in this joseki anyway, so  trying to make shape here is a little questionable.  on the other hand, c6  could make a great ko threat sometime later...]
;W[co];B[fn]C[reid: this push  is usually used when w has answered d4 with c6. in that joseki, white's shape  doesn't allow him to hane at f7, so he has to submit with e7 and b is  satisfied.   in this joseki however, w can hane at f7 which makes the cut at f4 a problem.   perhaps b should h5 here, although it's a shame to help white out that  way...]
;W[fm];B[fq];W[gp]C[reid: this looks like aji-keshi for w. the two  stones are not much better off than the single stone was, but after the  connection, b is very strong here.]
;B[fp];W[em];B[dj]C[reid: this feels a  little too close to white's thickness to me.]
;W[dh]C[reid: this is good - w  attacks b on a large scale and punishes d10 by pushing back towards his  strong wall.]
;B[fj];W[fh];B[hn];W[gj]C[reid: i think w would be better off  playing more patiently with something like l3 or m3.  he's already gained from the d10/12 and f10/f12 exchanges.]
;B[gk];W[gi];B[hk];W[hm];B[fl];W[gm];B[in]C[reid: making a bamboo joint with h4 would be a bit  safer.  this way, w can use the threat of pushing and cutting later.]
;W[kp];B[im];W[np]C[reid: o4 seems a bit funny.  the white group here is undercut  on both sides, so there is almost no territory there.  perhaps w should  consider q5 instead.]
;B[br]C[reid: the vital point for life for both sides!   nice spot :-)]
;W[po];B[cl]C[jlee: Terrible shape, isn't it?
reid: actually, the shape isn't so bad, but perhaps d8 is a little better.   i would probably expect to be able to kill white about now :-)]
;W[el];B[ek]C[reid: i think i would prefer to play e10 instead of e9.  seems a bit  stronger on the outside, ond not too much difference on the inside.]
;W[ar];B[bs];W[ck];B[dk]C[reid: this move is bad shape though :-( it makes an  empty triangle at e10. how about the hane at b9 instead?]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[bm];B[cj];W[bn]C[reid: so white lives, but b is stronger here, and he has  sente.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[jc]C[jlee: It was hard for me to decide  between upper side and right side. I thought the game was favorable to w at  this point.

reid: i think it's still pretty even, maybe even in black's favor now.   i would prefer taking something round q10 over k17.  q10 makes w's thickness  at q6 a bit strange.

on the other hand, if w takes k17 after b takes q10, w's box is undercut on  the left, and this whole moyo is really pretty thin for him.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[pj]C[reid: this is ideal for w.];B[gc]C[reid: might be good for b to peep at  e13 before playing g17]
;W[de];B[rd];W[pp]C[reid: the usual thing for w here  is to play p2 or o2.  q4 seems to help b more than w.]
;B[oq]C[reid: if b just  plays r2 instead, he either gets sente, or a good long jump into white's  territory.]
;W[nq];B[rn];W[rm];B[so];W[nr];B[qr];W[of];B[bh]C[jlee: I thought  this was a bit small, but the terrible shape of mine, and weakness around j8  made me play this...

reid: that's good reasoning, i'd say.  white could use that weakness to build  up his right side moyo.  by cleaning up the issue now (while eating into  white's upper side) b avoids that problem.]
;W[md]C[reid:  this seems to be  the wrong direction for w. it feels to me like white is losing his cool  perhaps.]
;B[ne]C[reid: good response!];W[re];B[qe];W[pe];B[qd];W[rf];B[me];W[sd]
;B[sc];W[se];B[cf]C[reid:  good! this is much bigger than s17 right  now.]
;W[df];B[ce];W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[ed];W[be]C[reid: simpler for w to just  connect.]
;B[dd];W[ad];B[cg];W[fd];B[ec];W[ff];B[db];W[cc];B[gd];W[ge];B[ee];W[ef]
;B[jq]C[reid:  oops! why the sudden change? can't b continue to build  up his top moyo and attack w with something like j15?]
;W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[gr];W[kq]C[reid: this is not very big for w. just look at the space between l3  and o3.  j15 looks bigger to me.]
;B[je];W[id];B[he];W[fc];B[fb];W[fe];B[eb];W[jd]C[reid: w can't afford this right now. his f14 group isn't settled  yet, and k16 is definitely behind enemy lines!]
