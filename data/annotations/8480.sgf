;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[ip];B[fo]C[Is this a good response here, or should I go C3?

H: This is a fine response.  There are some tricky ways W can complicate the fight, though.]
;W[dn]
(;B[pj]LB[dq:A]C[H: This makes f5 look bad.  Now white should focus on attacking black's weak group.  I would start at A, disrupting the normal joseki.]
;W[nq]C[H: A bit of an overplay on white's part.  Black can start a new plan, making use of the f3 stones.]
(;B[qn]C[H: this feels too slow.];W[dr]LB[kp:A][kq:B]C[Why is white playing this move? Is he attacking my weak group? How should I react?

H: white is taking advantage of you avoiding joseki.  Your group is now weak and without a base.  It's painful, but you will have to find a way to stabilize the group without harming the rest of the board.  I would consider A or B, to attack while defending.]
(;B[fc]C[I see no good continuation for my weak 2 stones so I decide to make a big move

H: Possible, but you are offering the stones to white on a platter.  Here, it's better to find a way to keep pressure on white.]
;W[hc]C[H: here, you have a weak, floating group.  You need thickness.]

H: White fears you destroying his points, but it is a bit too passive.]

H: What weakness at C15?  Please see the variation.];W[fd]C[since there is weakness at C15, i think this move is a bit too passive?

H: This move is honte, but a bit small.];B[oc]LB[jd:A][gf:E]
[ph:C][cl:B][pr:D]C[making endgame move for territory

H: it's not endgame.  You need to be making large attacking moves to make points right now!  A-E are other moves to consider.]
;W[ql]C[Q8 seems trouble for me, so I decide to make territory and weaken the aji of R13]
;B[qj];W[ol]C[H: Consider making pressure on the white group.  You can't allow white to decide the flow of the game.]

;W[ni];B[ph];W[ff];B[ce]C[I want to destroy his territory, but see no other way than first fix my weak spot. Now that I see it, maybe C13 is the better fixing spot?

H: There's no serious weakness, or else it wouldn't be a joseki. :)]
;W[fg];B[eh];W[gi]C[H: Now we see that white has made a large moyo.  If white plays safe, it should be hard for black to catch up.]
;B[cl]LB[nb:B][mf:A][ji:C][ki:D]C[seems biggest endgame move for me

H: Can't play endgame if already behind.  You must find an attacking move to break W's moyo.  If the choices are do-or-die, or simply die, better to play crazy. :)

I would consider ABCD as the weakest points in the shape.]
