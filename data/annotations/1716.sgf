C[
   First of all, thank you very much for your review and please excuse my bad english.

   In this game I played black. After two months playing this game I've tryed to learn a little about fuseki, but I know there will be many mistakes in strategy and local fighting.
   Most of all, I was very worried about invasions at the second half of the game and I lost most of my moyo there. Was it a mistake in defense of the moyo or was it just not well done and too hard to protect?]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[qe];B[cp]C[I didn't found R15 to really take the corner. If white had started with a R15 stone I sould play Q17 anyway to attack him.

good reasoning :) even if white plays p16 your stone is not quite dead yet and can be put into much use]
;W[nc];B[pe];W[qc];B[pd];W[qd];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc]
;W[rf];B[qg];W[rg]C[I am really not sure about this corner play, was it good counting it as a white corner invaded by me?

R14 is not really usual move. but the sequence you played is ok as long as:
you have a stone in the neighbourhood of k16 and you finish it with o16

I would have started at p16];B[iq];W[eq];B[ep];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr]
;B[dp];W[br];B[bq];W[cr];B[fq]C[I was thinking f3 or b4, but I feel the whole joseki was a bad choice.

It was ok....  b4 would be too small f4 confines white to the corner good result for black]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[ap];B[ao]C[not necessary at this time....
white a5 black a6 white takes black c6

you exchange sente for a few point loss ....];W[aq];B[dj];W[nq]
;B[lq]C[good];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po]C[here you playde correctly ... compare with your play in the corner above]
;W[qo];B[pm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq]C[I was counting on those moves. However now I don't know if this position is good for me.

yes it is I would not like to play white now];W[dm];B[cm]C[to protect c5.

another reason why a5 was bad  but c7 does not protect against the cut. please verify it .]
;W[fm];B[jd];W[jc];B[kc];W[jb];B[kb];W[hc];B[cg];W[fd];B[id]
C[I thought he would answer j17 and I planned something around e15, g15

j17 would have been an empty triangle - BAD SHAPE !!! - he didnt do it

instead of j16 a san san (c17 ) would be much more painful for white]
;W[cd]C[too late now];B[jj]C[Thinking about stopping f7 I felt tengen would connect all my stones.

hmmm you have many aji left

I would choose g6 to attacj the white stones and build territory while pudhing him up]
;W[ek];B[ej]C[d9 better you wolud aim at territory e10 does nothing in that respect]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[dl];B[fk];W[bk];B[cl];W[co]C[here it comes
:(];B[do];W[cn];B[dn];W[bn];B[em];W[bm];B[el]C[Well, I stopped the invasion of my moyo, but gave territory.

pyrric victory ....

your moyo is now virtually your only hope to win this game and moyos are hard to defend. it is always better to THREATEN to crreate a moyo and use this threat to build territory elswhere :)

as I said previously  d9 would be nuch better you wold have territory on the side and a smaller moyo]
;W[eg];B[ge];W[gd];B[gg];W[dh];B[ef]C[too greedy?

all past three moves are too greedy];W[ff];B[fg];W[df];B[gf]
;W[fe];B[eh];W[dg];B[ci]C[this started a problem. I think I had too much flaws around to play this.

we will see :)];W[ch];B[bh];W[bg];B[cj];W[bi];B[bj];W[bl];B[ai]
;W[bf];B[pi]C[why not r12?];W[jm]C[And here starts my complete lack of knowledge. I usually play reversed games with me on the outside and trying to invade a moyo, so I knew nothing about protecting my own.

actually this should not have been too hard....

white has  70 pts of secure territory   black has 140+ moyo

something must be wrog...

but white should have aimed at q9 I think to win this game but let us see what happens]
;B[hl]C[This must be a really poor move, but I felt h7 was not right. However, watching it now, It seems that h6 would protect low wall thinnes.

now there are no questions of high-low or territory. if white survives inside you lose you simply must kill him

splitting him into two with h7 would have been a good start]
;W[hm]C[good move for white];B[il]C[I'm really lost.

hmmm];W[io];B[im]C[ok];W[in];B[hn]C[the other side would be better I think ...]
;W[ho];B[gn];W[jp]C[l5? it would take away his eyespace and after r3 he cant get an eye - dont worry about territory if he lives you lost anyway]
;B[jq];W[kp];B[lp];W[kq];B[kr];W[lo];B[np];W[mo];B[mm]C[m7 better]
;W[lm];B[ll]C[l6 gives white life];W[km];B[kl]C[I saw both eyes forming, but had lost sente and had to protect. Was there any chance, or just bad aji since much before.

well hitting him at l6 would still give you some chances];W[jl]
;B[jk];W[mp];B[mq];W[no];B[nr];W[on];B[pn];W[ml];B[nm];W[om]
;B[ol];W[mn];B[mk];W[kn];B[rn]C[lost sente again...];W[qn];B[qm]
;W[ro];B[rm]C[it is not so big ... s8 stops white as well  at a latter time]
;W[ri];B[ic];W[ib];B[ja];W[ha];B[hd];W[gb]C[I saw l16 extreme weaknes later.

I would not worry about it...];B[qh];W[qi];B[qj];W[rj];B[pj]
;W[rh];B[og]C[useless?

yes];W[qk];B[pk];W[ql];B[rl];W[rk];B[pl]C[useless?

yes];W[go];B[fo];W[gq];B[gr];W[hr];B[hq];W[gp];B[ir]C[why not take e3 stone?

bigger];W[fp];B[er]C[now there is double atari left :(];W[fn]
;B[gm];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[fl];W[lh]C[And here it starts again. Much weakness around and a total lack of knowledje about how to manage thin situations.

now white is trying for a Mission Ipossible :)))


l16 and game over :) he cant live inside];B[lj]C[not necessary - the basic idea is to keep white eyeless if he tries m9 you connect he ataris at n10 and you extend - nothing for him there]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[ke];B[le];W[kf];B[kg]C[j14 - just be safe and dont give him room for eyes]

;B[sl];W[hp];B[hs]C[I was almost sure this was useless, but I still don't win nor lose games by one point and this one seemed mostly finished for me anyway.

there will be this first game you lose by 0,5 point... and you will regret not being exact :)


If you have any questions regarding this game please write to me :

You can meet me at Aurora server:

See you];W[od];W[je];W[jf];W[mi];B[nh];C[Well. My most important question is if this happened for a bad planning or a bad inside play. or maybe any of the two could have saved me and it's the addition which allowed such invasions.

   Thank you very much for your help.
