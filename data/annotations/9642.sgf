;B[dc];W[ff];B[ef]C[Why attach? attaching gives your opopnenet something to push against. You usually attach if you are invading and what to cross cut to "mix things up" or create shape for yourself. here  white 2 is not weak or strong. You could have played G6 or G3. In the case of G3 you can live small in the corner at the cost of giving white outside strength. G6 or C3 would have been my choices.]
