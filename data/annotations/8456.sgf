C[Thank you for the help! :) I recreated this game because it took place on our iphones. I've been palying for two months, and as sad as it sounds until the end I thought this one of my best games. I appreciate all tips and suggestions! :)

I am White by the way.

Hi
I'm Arcanus/David.
i will review your game.
I hope that my comments will help you :D];B[dd];W[jj];B[jd]
;W[dj];B[dg];W[kf]C[John: I was trying to build influence quick.
Arcanus: a good idea, but your moves were too isolated. losing thickness.]
;B[gd];W[fj]C[John: Would have been better to play b5?
A: i think that you played well, b5 is far more aggresive.]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[di]TR[ei]C[A: i think that f6 will secure yours groups.
always try to settle yours groups];W[eh];B[dh];W[fg]TR[fe][ld]
C[John: In this situation should you build a wall against black?
A: No attacking is more important, like m10 or f9];B[jf];W[hf]
TR[kd][ld][ke]C[John: I was trying to gain center influence.
A: Good idea but trying to extend your territory is better.]

(;B[lf]C[see variation];W[kg];B[lg];W[ie];B[je];W[id]C[John: An attempt to sepate black for future invasion.
a: try h11];B[ic];W[jc];B[kc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[hc];W[lh]
C[John: Was going to attempt to cut black at M9 in a few moves and capture the lower black.
A: first you need to strebgen yours groups];B[le];W[bi]C[A: maybe f9 will be better]
;B[bh];W[bj];B[ei];W[fi];B[eg]C[A: See variation]
(;W[fh];B[ej];W[ek]C[John: Here was the setup for my end later. Should I have secured these lowe pieces better?
A: yes, sadly you need to lose a move];B[ff];W[ef]
(;B[fe];W[df];B[cg]C[see variation]
(;W[cf];B[bf];W[ag]C[John: My goal was to kill blacks second eye and hope he didn't see he could kill the 3 pieces on top of this section. It was a hope that he would just play badly which I don't think was smart.
A: an advise NEVER assume an opponent mistake];B[bg];W[be]C[see variation]
(;B[af];W[ah];B[ai]C[I thought as soon as I killed his eye he would attack my grouping on top and I would not be able to capture his group in time.
A: you just killed the eye not the group.];W[cd];B[ah]C[John: He filled his eye, so I went to capture the upper left.
A: see variation];W[ae]

;B[if]
(;W[gf];B[he];W[ge];B[hd];W[fd];B[ed]C[John: He told me he played it safe here because he didn't know if I could end up capturing the top left wall.]
;W[ee];B[fc];W[fe];B[hb];W[fb];B[gb];W[ig];B[aj];W[bk]C[John: A run started here, and I couldn't see a way to stop it. Any ideas?
A: i think that white made the right call];B[ak]
(;W[bl];B[al];W[mg];B[am];W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[mf];W[mh];B[dk]
C[John: Right here I knew what he was trying to do but didn't even think it was possible so I didn't pay much attention. I should have played more cautiously.]
;W[dl];B[el]C[John: I still could have created a way of escape  by playing at F3 but again I didn't see this. Any suggestions for learning to see correct paths better? Is that all I could have done?
A: see more tesuji];W[ck];B[fk]C[At this point I resigned because I realized he would capture my grouping, and if I built a wall to keep him from expanding would still lose by around 5 points.

DId I miss something? Should I have secured this area earlier? Is it because my shapes were bad, and how should I learn better shapes? Go books?

Thank you so much for your time. All suggestions are appreciated as I am very new, and am trying to learn how to learn if that makes sense. I thought this was my best game so far until the end when I messed up so bad.

Thank you again :)
A: i suggest more life and death problems, you just need to play more games.
good luck. bye])
