;B[qd]C[Yo, mr. reviewer! I lost this game with terrible score, but i dont know real strength of my opponent, so...

TM:  Hello, I am the reviewer.  I will prefix my comments with "TM".]
;W[dc];B[pq];W[oc];B[pf]LB[mc:A][qj:B]C[Dont know about this response, i guess its normal.

TM:  This move is a bit uncommon, but playable.  It seems that you didn't know what to
do with these stones during the fighting later, so it would help to have a plan for where
to follow up after Q14:  consider an attack around A or an extension to B, for example.]
;W[po];B[qm]C[Still it seems to me pretty good)

TM:  This seems fine.  You will have a strong position if you can make R7 work with your
stones at the top.];W[qq]
(;B[qr];W[qp];B[mq];W[or];B[jq];W[oq]
(;B[dp]C[Dont know about this. I give up some stones for developing fast.

TM:  This strategy is incoherent.  You sacrificed the bottom right corner for fast development,
but now white is strong and your groups are weak.  Since the bottom left was empty and R7
is alone, you should think of making stable groups instead.]
;W[hq]C[TM:  The natural move.];B[fq];W[ip];B[jp];W[io];B[kn]
LB[on:A]C[dont know about this move.

TM:  This looks good.  Since your groups are weak, you can later aim towards A
(for example) to try to connect them.];W[qh];B[qj]C[Here became problems. I doubt in every my move)]
;W[oh]C[TM:  White is doing a good job of keeping your groups separated.]

(;B[pc]LB[mc:A]C[TM:  This is dangerous.  You are helping white build a wall and connect his stones.
This might be a good attack if you had a pincer around A, but since the top is open,
you should instead jump out.];W[od];B[oj];W[qe]
(;B[re]C[TM:  Too submissive.  White easily connects his stones.]

(;B[om]LB[oj:1][pj:2][qj:3][qk:4][om:7][qm:5][on:6]C[TM:  Is this move necessary?  How about putting some pressure on white?  You seem
to be getting pushed around by your opponent, and as a result he is building very solid
groups.  But he has weaknesses too, especially his J4 group.  Notice that you've played
seven stones just to capture two of his.];W[mm];B[gp];W[im]

;B[go]TR[hm][dn]C[TM:  Good move, but the timing is off.  Look at how much stronger this move would have
been before white got the marked stones.];W[gn]C[guess i still dont lose this game. what must i do? To defend D4 group or to prevent C15, which is very big for W now, in my opinion. Best is defend D4 in sente, by attacking H7 group, but i dont know how).
So i prefer standart probe at C15, but i think its dubious because of pincer is too good for W.

TM:  Yes, white has a very strong position and a lot of influence on the top and left sides.
You will have to work hard to erase his potential territory.]

;B[fn];W[fm];B[hn];W[in];B[gm]C[TM:  Good, this was a clever attack.  If you can break into white's territory you will even
out the game.];W[gl]
(;B[gn]C[TM:  Why not fight the ko?  You don't have anything to lose here.]
;W[hl];B[ik]C[I guess it still playable, but this move is really stupid. Its hard to kill my L9 group, so its better to jump at k 17 or simply cut at f8 - its pretty hard for W...

TM:  Indeed!];W[fl]C[TM:  Very thick.  This group is now unstoppable.]
;B[hi]C[TM:  This is uneffective.  It doesn't threaten white's group, and you have no moyo to build.
White will be happy to defend while taking territory.  Better for you would be to invade
white's moyo or to try to make territory at the top.];W[fi]

(;B[rn]C[Now i see - W shape is strong and territory on the left side is giant! i still can get some center points by attack W P17 group, so H11 can be useful. I must play K17 or  even L17, than M16 or so... I was afraid for my R9 group, but its pretty safe... Top is urgent.]
;W[jc]C[Guess i unconditionally lost the game here.]
(;B[ib];W[jb];B[ic];W[jd];B[na];W[mc];B[lb];W[lc];B[kb]C[TM:  These are just endgame moves and don't help your position.  White can easily
keep you separated, and meanwhile only makes his group stronger.]

[eo][fo][cp][ep][eq][kq][jr][kr][lr][ks][ls][ms]C[TM:  Your opponent played a very solid game, but the score would have been fairly
close had you avoided a few mistakes. Here are my suggestions for improvement:

1a.  Watch out for weak groups.  Try to stabilize your groups and connect weak groups
to each other.

1b.  Conversely, don't help your opponent connect his weak groups.  Keep them
separated and make them struggle to get eyes.

2.  Don't let your opponent push you around.  Take the offensive before he can solidify
a strong position.

3.  Don't be afraid to fight kos.  In the two ko fights that arose this game, you had nothing
to lose by fighting them, but you let your opponent connect instead.

4.  There are some common patterns you should learn that will make a big difference
in points, e.g. the jump to C7, dealing with the monkey jump in the bottom left corner,
and the seki in the top right corner.

I hope this helps!  Good luck with your next games.
