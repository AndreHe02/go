;B[bc];W[dd];B[ce];W[de];B[cf];W[cb];B[ci];W[jc]C[I felt this was joseki. So far I think we're pretty even.

fantomas : my feeling is that white is superior here because whte's position seems much more promising than black's one (black is very low after all), even though black has sente]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[ip];W[eq];B[cl]C[Playing at F4 seemed to slow and didn't feel balanced with q4.

fantomas : playing f4 is absolutly mandatory.
actually it is not slow because it protects the lower side and at the same time leaves an opening in white's corner. If white gets to play here he will get the 'tiger mouth' shape which cannot be allowed here.]

;B[hd]C[I'm curious about my invasion options here, and the sequence that followed.  The opponent eventually resigned in about 150 moves.  I feel that I won this game more because my opponent was too soft.  Any comments would be welcome.

Thanks :)

fantomas : this invasion is about your feeling, play where you feel like it. White's move is too wide here so i think your move is good.
There is no much to say about the way you played up to here so my comments end here.
Hope you enjoyed and don't hesitate to mail me back if you have any question.
