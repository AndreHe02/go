AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[A four stone handicap game I played against my younger brother.

I really don't have much of an idea of where I went wrong in this game.  Maybe some of the over aggressive splits (especially the one at the beginning) were the cause.

Any advice, on anything really, would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time...]

yoyoma: The real problem was blocking on the wrong side.  This way doesn't split O17, and R14 is not in a good spot, you would prefer to have it further away from the wall.]

yoyoma: Well this is ok, but its getting a little harder after the trades.  The real danger is that black G15 dies, so that's why I recommended you reduce first by pushing from that direction.]
