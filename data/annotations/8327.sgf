C[Hello!

I am interested in a review of this game, as it is one of the few my matches where neither side gets slaughtered; it kept me in suspence until the very end - as opposed to an early resignation or a difference of 100+ points. By the way, I'm white (:

Thanks in advance.

//Hi, my name is Ashish and I am your reviewer.  I occasionally am online on KGS as "Firadin" but i find it rarer nowadays.  If you have questions, its probably smarter to email me, at ashrestha1994@gmail.com

also, just so you know, it is better to review these games yourself first, before you send them over to the GTL.  This is so you can comment on where you thought you made mistakes, and so we have areas to focus on and we can answer your questions, instead of blindly looking at a game unsure of what you are looking for from us.]

(;B[fd];W[de];B[ee];W[df];B[kd];W[nc];B[qc]C[//not sure how to avoid it, but its worth noting: previously, there was something of a miai here, that is if he had played in the corner like he did here, you could have played out in the middle and gained height/more power there.  Your invasion has eliminated that miai because he is now able to play the corner without you being free to play in the side or you would lose top.  These are the calculations you should keep in ind, and its why i dont like this invasion much]

If you get a wall at G10, that does not mean that you get more territory because you do not yet have the other side, and in fact he probably does have it.  If he extends to say E14 or F14, the G10 stone is worthless.]

It doesnt work, but its at least worth looking at because its otherwise an interesting technique.  I think that, because of your low position and your general loose foundation for this fight you were in trouble to begin with.  cut your loses by connecting at O5 and then just minimize his gains in the corner.]

C[//most of the remainder of the game is yose, I dont have any other comments.  Its a good game, you have a solid idea of what you are doing early game especially.  The problem is just that you dont have as solid of an implementation as you need; your poor invasion of the top is bad, but at least you know to invade the top.  Things like that.  Just practice more is my main suggestion.]

This is a lot better for black because he can more easily maintain the top wall, whereas the K18 stone is weak and requires defending which strengthens you]
