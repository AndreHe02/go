AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, I'm black, although the opponent is the same rank and I had 2 stones (his choice), he get easily to equal game and then to win. (I resigned)
I am interested in comments at the beginning, choice of corner sequences. Some strategic decisions.
I made 2 bad mistakes at the end, I think, that's not the subject of the review.
There are moments in the game where I didn't know, what to play. I would be glad, if you could help me with that.
Thanks a lot for the review.                                                                                       Review by John Rae 1Kyu KGS                                                                               Both sides make  mistakes.                                                                                     They things to learn are;                                                                                            1) Notice the important moves.                2) Pay attention when your groups, or your opponents groups do not have eyes                                                          3) Learn the value of moves that threaten weak groups]

(;B[ck]C[first question - i think this is the right point for territory? (otherwise he would probably play immediately c8?)
is c9 good from fuseki view?];W[qf]C[JR:  See how C8 gives white the chance to expand both sides of his first 4-4 stone. Which position would you prefer?]

(;B[qh]C[I didn't want to let the side for white. It will be almost equal then, i think?                                                                             JR:  Equal - so soon? Black started with 2 handicap stones, equality after 9 moves would be extraordinary]
;W[of]C[JR: did you expect white to play this way - or were you assuming the jump to 3-3?]
;B[nd];W[pi];B[ph];W[oh];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[qk]C[JR: This is not the standard white move, so there should be a way to punish it. I've shown thoughts, may noy be best but give ideas to consider.]

;W[ql];B[rl];W[qm];B[rg]C[this is 2nd question - not sure what to do after white r9.
and he gets really big wall.
maybe i should play something completely different?                                                                                                JR: The time to do something was earlier]

;W[de];B[ce];W[ed];B[dc];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[ch]C[this all was probably non-standard corner... :/

;W[qc]C[JR: Good timing by white to take sente]
(;B[pc]C[i hope this is the right direction? or r16? i think he would get live in the corner.                                                                                                                        JR: I prefer the other direction :) This way gives white just as much territory for no gain.]
;W[qd]
(;B[re]C[something like compensation for r17? maybe too early? and too small?

AND - where should I play next? the area at the bottom seems open. (i'll invade it soon)
BUT my question aims at other points. L15? D12? F5? E9? J17? or some jump into the middle? (c2 is not yet playable, i think?)                                                                                                                      JR :this is end game. see the alternatives]

;W[oq];B[np]C[can black play some other move? for instance l3 or r3?

;B[ld];W[kd]
(;B[le]C[is this right? i could make atari (possibly from n17?), but i was afraid of his increasing influence to the center.                                                                      JR : see alternatives]

;W[fj];B[jc]C[JR: The black group on the bottom is beginning to look vulnerable.]
;W[jf]
(;B[lk]C[this is my most important moment of uncertainty.
he is building moyo. i can go into with M13, F6/F5?, E11/E12?. but everything seems like only getting white stronger and stronger. And I still have very weak group without life  - m5. so i tried to combine both things. get life for the group and reduce moyo from inside.

i guess this was strange. maybe too wide from m5??
i got 2 separated groups in the game.
well, but it's a 3-point wall, it should be 4 points jump, one more... but i couldn't defend nor this...
