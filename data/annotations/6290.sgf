C[klin: W S4 usually at N3];B[nq];W[ro];B[qn];W[qp];B[rn]C[neither player knows his joseki very well, but we thought this was an even result. were any good oppurtunities missed, what do you think about the outcome?

klin: Good for B.  But S6 can play at P6, a thick move.];W[iq]
;B[pf];W[qi]C[pincer neccesary to preemptively stop B right side moyo? could be dangerous no?

klin: Not dangerous.];B[pj]C[klin: B Q10 too strong.  When attack, should chase the opponent to your strong side.  So P11 is better.]
;W[oh];B[pi];W[ph];B[qj]C[klin: Q11 and R10 are bad moves.  They hurt the Q14 stone.]
;W[ne];B[pg]C[klin: Q13 bad, should judt O14.];W[rh];B[nf];W[me]
C[direction of play?

klin: No choice but running for life.  All were caused by Q10, Q11, R10 3 moves.]
;B[re];W[rd];B[qe];W[qd];B[mg];W[mh];B[lh];W[ng]C[klin: W O13 should O12]

;W[rj];B[qg];W[qh];B[rk];W[mj];B[oe];W[od];B[le];W[li]C[vital point, M15 a mistake yes?

;W[lm];B[jn]C[could B have tenukied? D11 (or maybe C3 if it could be done in sente) seem huge right now

klin: No, K6 is good by itself.];W[ee]C[Is this the best placement? when in doubt complete your opponent's shape is W's rule of thumb]
;B[df];W[fh];B[je]C[weak move no?];W[ef]C[klin: W E14 should G15]
;B[dg];W[gf];B[cq]C[W took advantage of this bad timing ... B thought extensions on top or left side were miai so he could take this opportunity to take the corner. Maybe D11 the better move?]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[fr];W[di]C[W enjoys playing this move.]

;B[dk]C[because B did not want to play this ko.

;B[lc];W[rc];B[pe];W[sb]C[any mistakes?

klin: too many mistakes to comment.  For example, the key point at the corner is T18.  B Q5 is a useless move.  If B played at T18, W coner is dead.  For the same reason, W W17 was a suicide move.

No more comment beyond this point.];B[dc];W[db];B[cb];W[hc]
