Dear reviewer,

I hesitated a little bit when submitting this game, because I made a misclick, which my opponent did not let me take back. Nevertheless, this game illustrates quite well the type of opponent I am having trouble with. Namely the ones who take solid territory first and then neutralize my influence later. This is exactly what happens in this game. I pretty much felt behind from early on (I play White). Maybe this is not actually true and just psychological, but it is difficult to play calmly when feeling behind. My own comments are marked with AB. Anyway, thanks for your comments!

-Hi, my name's Amar and I used to play on KGS and also Tygem for a while. I'm 2-3d, I don't play as much currently but if you have any questions, feel free to email me!

I think the misclick itself didn't lose you the game but you clearly weren't playing ideally on a psychological level. If you like to play an influential style, you're going to need to learn how to use it better and also play with a whole board outlook continuously. You played a lot of slow moves at times or contradictory moves when having a big influence. Also, when you play mainly through influence, it's harder to estimate what you have and you clearly do that as you think you're losing all the time when the game is actually not that bad if you secure some points.

 DorianGray 2k?: 199 sorry lost connection];B[qe]C[AB: Already a move that makes me feel uncomfortable :-).

- I would have to ask why it makes you uncomfortable? If it's just cause you're not used to it, then I can see but B is not even approaching you here. It's a very passive move which allows you to do what you want to do now. For example, I may play K4 now which is what you did, a fine move as B has let you do as you feel.]

;W[pk]C[AB: At this point I was already worried that Black gets all four corners...

-B may have got all 4 corners but I don't think that's necessarily terrible. It really does make you depend on being skillful with your influence though. Q9 is a very understandable move given your stones on bottom left.]
;B[on];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[lq]C[-Black is very greedy here and can be punished.]
;W[mo]C[AB: Black's move seems like an overplay, it's up to me now to punish it :-).

-Good choice here.];B[jq];W[iq];B[ir];W[jr]C[AB: Was it correct here to play all out?

;W[hr];B[ip];W[hq];B[jo]
(;W[mm]TR[jp]C[AB: Should I have moved out the marked stone? It seemed very risky to me...

-I don't think you should have directly saved the stone but I think this was a passive way of attacking black and punishing him, especially your next sequence.]
;B[kp]C[-Black has decided to capture now I actually believe you could have just killed black on right side or at least made it so he's closed in completely with only two eyes.]
;W[pm];B[pn]
(;W[nk]C[AB: I decided to strengthen my outside...

-This was a terrible move, you need to ask yourself what you gained with this move in terms of local position and whole board position. Black has a lot of space in the bottom to just extend around your influence. Black has a very weak group at the moment, you can actively strengthen your outside by just attacking him as well.]
;B[rq]C[AB: Naturally...];W[rr];B[rk];W[kn];B[kr]
(;W[hs]C[AB: My misclick, obviously I wanted to take the stone...

-Yes, its not that huge of a misclick though of course it would leave black a bit more weak though he does have moves like O2 to create one eye.]
;B[nr]C[
 DorianGray 2k?: 575 typo!];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[bs]
(;W[ch]C[AB: Now I am already a little frustrated...

- I can see that but now we should look at the whole board. You really don't have any points in territory but you have a lot of influence into the centre. What is this move accomplishing? You want to use your influence as best as possible so a 4th line play would be good to start creating a structure.]
;B[ee];W[db]C[-What was the point of the probe here? The correct response if you want to do anything after is C17.]
;B[eb]
(;W[lc]C[-This is a very slow move now, especially after your probe. Again, take a look at the whole board and what you can do.]
;B[go]C[You're lucky black didnt go J7 instead.];W[hm];B[fp]
;W[fq];B[pr];W[qr];B[oq];W[op];B[om]C[- Everytime black makes a move, you should carefully look at it. You should note while you didn't directly respond to this move, you played in that area. Playing something like F13 is huge right now too.]

(;W[rl];B[ql];W[qk];B[rm];W[rj];B[sl];W[fg]C[AB: It's hard for me to estimate the score...

-Well I can see that it's hard to estimate what you will have, for B, I'd say he has lower left and his two groups bottom right. Also most likely top right. So that's about 20-25 points so far.]
;B[ge];W[fb]C[- I don't like this move, you have a lot of aji in top left, you could have created a ko for corner I believe.]
;B[cb];W[pl]C[- No need to use up ko threats now, this isn't an important move. Also, it's important that you actually read it, at first glance it may seem like this is an obvious move B needs to respond to but after some reading, it's actually almost not needed. In the end it is needed based on a ladder but that actually takes some reading to reach. And again, this is just a ko threat.]

C[AB: Obviously I felt I have to keep the center and kill whatever Black puts there. But of course this move leaves a weakness...

-Surprisingly, you're wrong but I can't say how close it is given how your centre is so broken up. I'm fairly confident you could have let black run off as long as you took from the centre and the left side as marked.  Getting that part would have made the game close at least.]
;B[ni];W[oi];B[mh];W[ng];B[mg];W[nf];B[mf]
(;W[me]C[AB: Maybe this was a mistake...

-Yeah, I'm actually fairly confident if you extended to the end, black would have been in big trouble too or you start stealing top right.]
;B[ne];W[le]C[- Also, this move was a big mistake too, I don't see why you did it instead of protecting your group on the right.]
