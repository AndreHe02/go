AB[pd][dp][pp]C[aranach is a little better than 13k kgs, so the 3 stone handicap is more appropriate.

Hello aranach and kefo. I've put comments and some variations throughout the game record, either in response to your questions or to highlight points of my own.

In the final move I've put general comments about the game, and things that you might want to look out for in future games.

If you have any questions, do feel free to either email me or to contact me (tealeaf) if you see me on KGS.

So, here we go...];W[dd];B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[cn]
C[I'll agree with this move from kefo. It gives a good chance of working with the stones in the top left, and so giving white a good side to work from in the rest of the game.]
;B[fp];W[bp];B[cq]C[Black's moves are perfectly appropriate in this situation.]
;W[qj]C[Too early! It's easy to see in hindsight, but white's stones at the bottom left are too open to attack. A move like C9, or even D8, would have settled those stones and given white a good chance at grabbing the entire left hand side.

I don't like to recite proverbs, but: "urgent moves before big moves" is just too appropriate here.]
;B[cl]C[aranach - I thought white's wedge was a little early since he didn't have a base.

kefo - black stone here is painful to white.

---

I agree with you both. This is extremely upsetting for white.

I'm not sure that white's move classes as a "wedge", though.]
;W[cj]C[Not unreasonable play from white, here. If nothing else it puts a little pressure on the black stone and works with the top-right stones to mark out a nice chunk of territory.]

(;B[el]TR[bp][cn]C[Black's reponse is perfectly acceptable, although you could also consider D7 if you wanted to put more pressure on the marked stones. (Given the position of those, more pressure is always a good thing.)]

(;W[en]C[This move doesn't really go anywhere. Black already has stones on either side. It's more important to try and give your stones a base. I would suggest B7 followed by B3.]
;B[gl];W[bq];B[br];W[gn];B[hp]C[aranach - I seem to have created a weak running group and now have to defend my bottom territory to keep it out of trouble.

---

Black should be ecstatic with this result! White's got a very weak group that is having to run away, and that's presenting black with nice easy territory on the lower side.]
;W[bl];B[in]C[Wrong place. White's not going anywhere with that little run out to the centre; and the further he goes, the more territory you're picking up along the bottom side. On top of that, white can easily break through that little capping move.]
;W[cp];B[dr]TR[br][cq][dp]C[This shape is tempting because it defends both cutting points. Generally, though, I prefer to play a solid connection somewhere. In this case, probably at D3 rather than D2.

While it's not completely applicable in this situation, the shape made by the marked stones is both a source of ko threats and can lead to cramped shape if white chooses to peep.]

(;W[do];B[ep];W[hm]
(;B[fn]TR[cl][el][gl]C[aranach - Here I wanted to separate white into two groups and keep my groups connected.

---

A bit keen. You've let white make a base on the edge, which is regrettable but we're here now and have to deal with it. So, from this situation I would be more tempted to jump out with the marked stones and make life independently whilst pressing down on white. See the variation.]
;W[fm];B[fo];W[fl];B[em];W[fk];B[ek]C[aranach - I managed the cut, but now my group is in trouble. I hope to live over on the side by chasing a little, then putting pressure on white's corner group.

---

I'd characterise this little fight as trying a little too hard. You tried so hard to cut a group that was reasonably well connected, and wasn't gaining much by being so, and ended up with your own weak and separated group.

You would have been better to lean on the stones or, as in the earlier variation, just push on top and make life independently. White wasn't gaining much by what he had, so there was no need to risk so much in cutting him.]
;W[hk]C[kefo - bad, think e10 is better.  white was trying for everything but g8 stone is not important.]
;B[hn];W[gm]C[kefo - white shape is stupid

---

You said it. I'd prefer to say "inelegant" or "cramped". :) We all do it.

In this situation, there's not a lot to be gained by the connection that you make. I'd play at G9 instead of G7. It makes white's outside more solid and gives you somewhere to run. The only thing that G7 does is upset people. :)]
;B[bm];W[cm];B[bk];W[dl];B[ck]
(;W[bn]C[This fight is rather scrappy, but you both seemed to have fun.

This move, though, falls at the wrong point. I would leave it at this point and focus on connecting the white group out. By playing this moves, white forces black to take the stone at B7 and so removes any future potential that it might have.]
;B[al]C[aranach - I don't want white getting through underneath, I have one eye.]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[dm];B[ci]C[aranach - this lets me live on the side, my original goal, but at the cost of my cutting stones.

I'm unsure if this was the best move, but if I read the capture race that occurs if I play at e10 instead, I think I lose the b9 group.

White does not seem to make a lot of territory from all this either, so I am happy enough with the result.]
;W[ej];B[bj]C[aranach - I think maybe d11 would have been better, as white can now play there and push me down on the side while building a thick wall.

I played here because I didn't want the captured stone to cause trouble later and I could get out of atari that way.

kefo - seems black has about 40 points, white much less..  white d16 group not worth anything after black strength here.

the idea play white d11 - sorry it looks bad to me, think black just answer with d12.  idea to seal in black sounds good, but black can get in from top also, with f15 for example.

white was not happy here during the game, put so many stones on the left, and got nothing for them.

---

With respect to this little exchange, black has done far better than white. White has made his group live, but in an ideal world would have been looking at the entire left side. Instead, black has made a good chunk of territory along the bottom, and destroyed white's side.

In a purely local sense, I quite like either E11 for black rather than this move. The stone that remains has some small potential, but it isn't worth such a solid defence.

In the sense of the overall board, though, there are far bigger points for black to play. F15 is absolutely huge, and there are points like R13, O17, R6 or O6 that are all much preferable to this.]
;W[qn]C[Not unreasonable for white. A good chance to get the side away from black.]
;B[qo]C[aranach - I played here with hope to protect the lower right corner and because a move on the left felt somewhat submissive.

I don't this this play was the best, but I am at a loss for what else to play. perhaps something like q6?

kefo - this makes the r10 stone on perfect spot, so maybe not strongest black play.

---

kefo is right. This play by black just strengthens white. This move is played automatically by a lot of players and it's often just wrong!

A simple response at O3 or O4 would have worked to make the lower side a good chunk of territory for black, and would have left the opportunity to attack white.

At this point, black is looking to be quite ahead on territory, so doesn't need to be too jealous.

Of course, if you /really/ don't like this move then you can invade at R8. Take a look at "Get Strong at Invading" for more details.]
;W[pn];B[no]C[aranach - I played here hoping to keep a high wall over toward the left. I think this move was part greed and part curiosity about what would happen and how white would respond.

kefo - thought this was interesting, but maybe too high since white group is safe.  white did not find best play after however.

---

Well, you got to see some of the effects. :) Again, you are doing well in terms of territory, so a safer move is better.]
;W[np]C[kefo - think this is not best, p4 a try with this shape, or r3.]
;B[mp]C[aranach - I appear to have invited white to jump into the territory I wanted, so I hoped to chase him out and live with the wedge of white stones as a lesson.]
;W[mq];B[nq];W[op]
(;B[oo]C[aranach - After getting to a point where I think I could have chased white out without too much damage, I got concerned about a huge white wall.

---

In the situation, this is a little greedy. Just connect underneath and cut your losses.]
;W[oq];B[nr];W[mo];B[lp];W[or];B[mr]C[aranach - I was almost ready to cede the whole corner at this point, as it was unclear to me how my corner stones would live. This at least let me keep the lower side.

---

You let your stones be split, partially because you didn't want to lose a few more points earlier on. So you ended up fighting in two places at the same time. Always try to avoid being cut, and if it means sacrificing a few points earlier, it's better than lots of points later!]
;W[lq]C[aranach - I was surprised to see white play this.

kefo - this was a poor result for white.  q5 instead simple.]
;B[kq];W[lo];B[kp];W[po];B[qp]C[aranach - I had a hope I could trade the o5 stones for life in the corner by threatening white's p4 group.

---

It's worth a try. :)

The black stones at O5 aren't much of a threat, so I would have expected white to kill at R2.]
;W[nn]C[kefo - white play on r2 is fine.

---

I agree.];B[pr];W[os];B[pq];W[on]C[aranach - I was surprised to see white take these stones before being forced to.

---

It's like Christmas. :)

Yes. White had much better things to do. I would personally have left the black stones alone and played somewhere like R14 or F15. I've had a play, and I can't see an easy way to kill them. I might regret it in a real game, though. :)

It hurts to play, but C14/C13 is quite urgent for white.];B[rq]
C[aranach - I'm pretty sure this makes life, but I'm not sure if it's the best way to.

kefo - think s2 also ok.

---

If you felt you needed it, of course it's best to play there.]
;W[go]C[kefo - useless play.

---

Given the state of the board, there's nothing here to gain for white.]
;B[gp];W[jo]C[kefo - this does not keep black in, white can try l7 instead.]

(;B[jp]C[kefo - black is taking the safe territory, so can't complain when he get sealed in.  he can play l7 or k7 for example, many ways in.]

(;W[jm]C[kefo - white thought he would need a big center, after black took so many on the bottom.  but black can still get in, so it was not a good result.

---

The board is split between black's very loose territory at the top (more like potential territory at this point) and the wall that white has along the bottom. If white wants the centre, he needs to build up a moyo on top of black's top territory.

My first move here would be R14 to get territory. If black is helpful and plays O17 or R15 then you're already halfway to a nice big chunk of white territory.]
;B[ei]C[kefo - looks small but white answered.  bad + bad = good?]
;W[fi];B[eh];W[fe]C[kefo - black play here would hurt.

---

It would. It's a shame you only played it after the last couple of moves that stopped it from working nicely with your influence lower down.]
;B[md]C[aranach - Gote territory grab. Feels bad now with white's weak looking top left corner group.

kefo - black can't call the top territory yet, but at least it is not white points.  think white has better chances than before, with strength facing the center.  but for safe points he can't compete with black.

---

This is huge for black. A white play here (or at N17) would change the board considerably. This was very good for black. White has very little to really call his own, and black is sitting on some nice big areas.]
;W[jd];B[jc]C[kefo - j6 play for black instead looks good but he is taking the safe points, maybe it is ok.

---

j6 might be nice, but I like this follow-up. Black has to remember not to let white get too much influence, but keeping this territory is nice for the moment.]
;W[ld];B[lc];W[kc]
(;B[le]C[aranach - One of my problems seems to be getting sealed in. I hoped this might prevent that.

kefo - interesting, was expecting l18.  maybe black was afraid to be sealed in, but even if he play l18 instead he can still get in.  and, don't think it is automatically bad to be sealed in, if you get more points at the end.

---

aranach: You play a little bit /too/ safely, I'll admit. I do the same. Unfortunately, you seem to choose the wrong moments to go all-out for bravery! You really wanted L18 here. Never let your groups get split like this if you can possibly help it. Sort out the situation, then build off from your corner.]
;W[kd];B[lb]C[kefo - black cutting his own stones to make territory, was happy with this result.

---

Oh yes.];W[kb];B[jb]C[aranach - Concern about eyespace after a monkey jump led me to this bad shape move.

---

Concerns about monkey jumps are quite wise. Here, though, I would be tempted to move up first. Push out into the centre a bit to reduce white's centre. Your stones have a fair amount of room to make eyes, so you can afford to be a bit daring.

Regardless, for what you want to achieve I would have played H18 rather than the empty triangle that you made. :)]

(;W[la]C[Too small. Push up first.]
(;B[mb]C[It's almost a silly rule, but if you find yourself making an empty triangle then there's almost /always/ another move that does the same thing more effectively.]
;W[me];B[ne];W[mf]
(;B[nd]C[This defence is unnecessary. Pushing along would be safe enough and would gain you lovely, lovely territory.]
;W[nf];B[of];W[og]C[aranach - So much for not getting sealed out of the center, plus my groups were split.

kefo - yes, this is dream result for white.  felt game was over now, but black gave white a chance to lose later, and he took it. :)]
;B[pf];W[qc]C[kefo - not necessary, if white wants to play on this side maybe q12 or q13 is a play.]
;B[qd];W[nb]C[This is the empty triangle's fault. Learn to feel disdain for it.]
;B[mc];W[pb];B[rc];W[rb];B[pc];W[qb];B[rd];W[ma];B[oc];W[ob]
;B[oe]C[aranach - I'm alive, though it's ugly, and I hope to break through the wall or skirt it.

kefo - p15 is not necessary.

---

Well done, white. You took advantage of the weakness and stole a fair chunk.

P15 is indeed unnecessary, it would have been far better at R12.]
;W[hd]C[kefo - think j16 instead, or h15.];B[hc];W[fh];B[dg]
;W[ef]
(;B[ng]C[Hmm. Although this worked out in the end, I would have preferred to see the threat of Q13 and watched black walk along the fourth line.]
;W[oh];B[lf];W[mg];B[nh];W[id];B[ko]C[kefo - not very ambitious, black can still go up to l6.

---

Yes. L6 is a nice peep that can connect either way. Still, it's relatively small compared to C14 or R12.]
;W[kn];B[jn]C[kefo [8k\]: think u can play l6 instead of l5]
;W[ho];B[io]C[kefo - of course black did not fall for l7, white m6, and then j7.]
;W[km];B[cf];W[eg]
(;B[dh]C[Better at C13 (or C12).];W[ce];B[bf];W[cb];B[eb];W[qh]
;B[qg];W[rh];B[ph];W[oi];B[ni];W[nj]C[kefo - black nicely punished this.

---

Black did well with this, but it was quite scrappy. There were mistakes on both sides and I wouldn't rely on this sort of play against stronger players!]
;B[lh]C[aranach - I was happy to sieze this opportunity.

kefo - yes, this should be the end.

---

(seize)

Black should now sit back and play ultra-safe moves until the end of the game.]
;W[li];B[mh];W[kh];B[kg];W[jg]C[You held out for a few moves, then got worried! Don't take the stones unless you really need to.]

;W[ml];B[mk]C[This throws away sente for black. Find somewhere else to play. White can't cut, so why force him to make you connect solidly in gote?]
;W[nk];B[lk];W[pg]C[kefo - big mistake.];B[oj]C[kefo - or o8 directly.]
;W[pi];B[nl];W[ok];B[mm]C[kefo - black should keep going with p8.  lot of mistakes from both right to the end :)

P18 would have been worth a couple more points. Given how close the game became, I can't disagree. :)]

It's all very small.]

;B[ik];W[dq];B[eq];W[il];B[ra]C[kefo - during the game, thought black should continue the ko.

aranach - I felt white had far more ko threats, so I was trying to get something for my efforts.

[jr][kr][rr][sr][cs][ds][es][fs][gs][hs][is][js][ss]C[Final comments:

aranach (black):

You focused on territory, and were a little bit too passive. You seem to very much underestimate your own territory, and this tends to make you attempt some desperate attacks against the opponent. Learn to live and let live -- you don't have to kill everything.

Having said that, when you did decide to be more aggressive you were /too/ aggressive. I think that this is possible because you only make these attacks when you feel that you're behind. Try, rather than "defending" and "attacking" to think more of pressing and leaning against the opponent. When you back away, back away reluctantly, don't jump away and hope he doesn't come after you. :)

Apart from that, watch out for those empty triangles. They are inefficient and bad. When you learn the moves that replace them, you'll find you game a bit more elegant-feeling.

Don't focus too much on your opponent's territory. Look at your own and realize that pulling back can be gaining you solid territory. Having said that, a few more invasions would do you good.

I suppose that, really, your main problem is learning to balance when to attack and when to defend. Also, your attacks are a little... scrappy. They worked quite well here, but against stronger players you'll run into problems. I'd suggest working on "good shape" moves to help you see how to most effectively use your stones.

For you, I'd suggest having a look at "Making Good Shape" and /possibly/ "Attack and Defence", although that might be a bit advanced for the moment. 

kefo (white):

The main things that stand out in this game for white are:

a) The mistake in the bottom left at the start.
b) A little bit too focused on the centre rather than the sides.

On the plus side, you were relatively good at pushing black around when you got the chance.

My advice for you would be always to ensure that your stones are alive before you try anything else. Particularly with the first point, you jiumped away when your stones were still weak.

You ended up with a nice chunk of centre territory, but even that was reduced quite a lot. A stronger player wouldn't have let you get away with turning territory into influence so easily. Make sure that you balance real, solid territory and influence.

Apart from that, be sure to think carefully in each move. A couple of notable disasters for you happened because you seemed to rush a little bit.

Both:

A nice game, although it was quite scrappy in places! Still, it's good fighting practice. :)

I hope that the review was helpful, and I'm sorry it took a bit longer than I said it would. Again, if you have any questions then feel free to send me an email or chat to me on KGS. If I'm online, do feel free to ask for a game.
