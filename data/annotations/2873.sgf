C[Dear reviewer,
in this match i played black. I'd like to know bigger errors and what i should improve in my style. I would be glad if you could also show me moves bigger (or more urgent) than mine. Other questions during the game. Thanks!

n - OK, I will try to help.];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[kq];W[nq]
;B[gp]C[n - This is an interesting sequence for Black...];W[fq]
;B[gq]LB[fp:B][gp:A]C[n - I think this move is inconsistent with A, which was moving aggressively towards the center.  Perhaps B would have been an interesting response here.]
;W[fp];B[cn];W[bp];B[ck]C[n - Well, your groups don't feel too strong, and they're not making any territory; but then, you have a wide presence across the board.  The game is still close.]
;W[en];B[dh];W[hc];B[ec];W[kc];B[nc]LB[pd:B][pj:A][pn:E][qn:D]
[qo:F][qp:C][pq:G]C[n - ...these last moves have been very natural.  But this one seems forced.  Remember that B has more outward influence than influence towards the corner.  Your enclosure in the upper left works great; this one does not really make territory, and it's not really attacking the W stones.

I would probably play A, and see what W does next.  This expands the outward influence of B.  

You might also approach with a move like D, E, or F.  Remember than you can invade at G if W gives you a chance.]

;W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[ql]LB[kq:A]C[what about this?

n - You are strong above the W stone, so you want to start a fight.  I like it.  Again, the W enclosure is a little thin because of your stone at A.]
;W[pk];B[pm];W[qn];B[nm];W[nk];B[ol]C[n - I don't like this move.  It doesn't correct any real weakness in your stones, but it strengthens W and gets rid of possibilities for the future.]
;W[ok];B[lm];W[ml];B[mm];W[kk];B[jm];W[mi];B[ld]LB[nb:E][ld:D]
[cf:C][jm:A][pq:B]C[n - The game remains close, and we're moving into the later midgame.  Your conservative move at A has left your groups on the bottom side pretty safe; you have no immediate attacks against any W groups.  So we need to look at territory and determine overall strategy now.  A quick count shows both sides have about 60 points or so.  

So, two questions?

1.  What important weaknesses remain for both sides?
2.  Where can either side make territory?

The rule is, "Urgent moves before large moves", so we consider weaknesses first.

1.  I think it's safe to say W still has a serious weakness at B.  The black strategy of creating the group at A has not created as much of an opportunity there as we hoped, but the B strength above and to the left can bolster an invasion here.

2.  W has a large invasion around C.

3.  There is also a weakness in the B position lower down, see variations.

Your move at D is probably smaller than all of these, I think. There's just not that much territory to be made in the middle or upper side, with the black group on the side being strong.  You should be able to reduce W there.

The best case scenario would be, invade at B, come out in sente, and play a move like C to close of the left side.  If you could do that, it would be your game.]

(;W[lc];B[md];W[nb];B[kd]LB[cf:A]C[n - This is a small move.  How many points does it give you?  None.  How many points would W get from playing there?  Maybe 5.  By contrast, A is worth at least 20.]
;W[jd];B[je];W[ie];B[jf];W[oc];B[od];W[mc];B[nd];W[if];B[jg]
C[n - This sequence is an absolute victory for W.  B has gained about three points; W has prepared for an invasion of the left.]
;W[lf]LB[cf:A]C[n - W misses the boat!  Now play A!];B[ik]C[n - Well, it's probably sente, and perhaps you can build up something facing the left this way.]

;B[cf]C[n - at last.];W[fc];B[eb];W[fb]LB[pq:A]C[I think i could with my strong wall attack the lower right corner but i have no idea how to do this.  Could i?

n - As noted above, at A.]
