C[Commented by NM at the request of B.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]
;B[qj]C[NM:
I think this combines poorly with the two stones already played. If B
wants to play in this area, I would suggest the fourth line.]
;W[oc];B[pe];W[jd];B[nd]C[NM: The invasion at N17 or M17 is also possible.]
;W[nc];B[md];W[lc];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[qo];B[op]C[NM:
Not good; it doesn't put enough pressure on W. The best move is R4; if
W takes Q5 B can then attack at O4.];W[rq];B[qm]C[NM: Good territorially, but there is no real possibility of attacking W.]
;W[oo];B[np];W[qr];B[qq]C[Better to leave this till later.]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[pl];B[ql];W[pj];B[pm];W[qi];B[pk]C[NM: I would simply push through at P7. This move helps W to make shape.]
;W[rj];B[qk];W[oh];B[pi];W[ph];B[oj];W[qh];B[pc];W[mc];B[od]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qe];B[se]C[NM:
A move round C11 is bigger. There is also the possibility of cutting
off W P5, which would give B a big area in the bottom right. (For
example, by cutting at S4 and sacrificing that stone.)];W[rg]
;B[rk];W[sf];B[sd];W[pf];B[qf];W[rf];B[of];W[qg];B[og];W[oi]
;B[po];W[qp];B[pp];W[rn];B[cf]C[NM: I would prefer C11, with its possible extensions on either side, but this is OK.]
;W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[bc]C[NM: Bad! Should be at C11 or D11. This is too small, and invites W C12.]
;W[cg]C[NM: More conventional, and in my view better, would be C12.]
;B[bg];W[ch];B[df]C[NM: I think I would push at B12 first since he can hardly ignore that]
;W[bh];B[cb];W[db];B[cd];W[dc];B[ca];W[da];B[ab];W[er];B[eq]
C[NM: Not the biggest point on the board! I would play C8 at this point, but if that's too sgressive for you what  about M10?]
;W[dq];B[fr];W[cl];B[fn]C[NM: Good!];W[el];B[dj]C[NM: Too deep now - W could attack at F12. Better at G8.]
;W[cj]C[NM: B was lucky that W defended.];B[dk];W[ck];B[dl]
;W[dm];B[em];W[di];B[ej];W[ei];B[fj]C[NM: But B has terrible shape ...]
;W[fo];B[go];W[fp];B[gp];W[fm];B[fl];W[en];B[gn];W[gm];B[fi]
;W[hm];B[jn];W[jm]C[NM: ... and moreover B has left himself with a weak group to defend.]

;B[hh];W[kg];B[ge];W[ff];B[fe];W[eg];B[ee];W[he]C[NM:
As B I'd be tempted to play G16, but the centre group is too big to
take chances with ... shame ...];B[ie];W[hd];B[id];W[hc]
(;B[kh]C[NM:P I think B should continue. See variation.];W[jg]
;B[jh];W[ic];B[je];W[kd];B[lg];W[ke]C[NM:
After this the game remains close, and the yose is played competently.
