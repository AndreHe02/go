C[Hello and thanks a lot for this review. I played Go for a short, intesive period when I was 17 years old but I dropped it for other interests (you know, girls, rock star career and that kind of stuff :-). Now, about 20 years later I finally found back. Acutally I started with reading some books and buy a go board at the beginning of this year. This was my first (and up to now only) game. When I stopped playing go , I was rated about 10 - 12 kyu, and as I could still solve 10 kyu problems easily, I thought I could start as 15 kyu. Obviously a missjudgement. Ok, here we go.

<W> Hi, I will be marking my comments in this fashion.

<W> Your biggest problems in this game is your lack of urgency. You ommit vital moves, threaten elsewhere when the threat is smaller than the consequences of what you leave behind. Related to this, you also play too risky in general, and should probably focus in what they call "honte". Solid, honest moves, nothing fancy, just playing the most fundamental answers, admitting no weaknesses. You shouldn't follow your opponent around, but there's a balance to be struck...

<W> Also, while you play the balance between influence and territory pretty well, I see little reasoning in your comments about this. Perhaps something to brush up on the theory of? I know my greatest strenght boost came from considering influence, what it can be used for (besides cosmic moyos!), and how to counter it.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[qn];W[nc];B[pf];W[pc]C[jjayjay: first mistake. In the following sequence I never really had a plan. Now this close contact really looks messy to me. brrr.


<W> The contact is good when black has played low on R14 here, making him slightly overconcentrated. When he has played Q14, this shape is perfect for black]
;B[qc];W[od];B[pb]C[<W> When you have played P16 instead of Q18, it is pretty important to follow up on the threat by playing Q15. See variations for possible continuations]

(;W[oe]LB[oe:A][pe:B];B[pe];W[qi]C[jjayjay: ah, kind of overplay. I should go for some more secure stuff, didn't I? 
I must admit, that at this point of the game I really underestimated the abilities of a 17k. I thought I could get this baby home easily...

<W> Take the top here, to balance blacks right side. This stone will always have a hard time getting a stable base, and as such you are just creating problems for yourself by either getting a weak group early, or by giving black a free move, if he can capture it on a large scale.]
;B[qk];W[of]C[<W> Pushing when this high is very disadvantageous.]
;B[ph];W[jd]C[<W> Good! Black played defensively against the R11 stone, so the loss wasn't too bad.]
;B[jq];W[ce]C[jjayjay:  rather answer, I think now....

<W> No, this is fine, your top side is developing nicely, while black is very low almost everywhere. Here I would look for opportunity to exploit blacks defensive style, by pushing for more and more outside influence, and perhaps going for a big moyo.]
;B[fq]C[jjayjay: ...because of this

<W> Again black is very low, don't worry about it.];W[fp]C[jjayjay:  My plan was to keep black low and get some cosmic mojo around the upper left corner.

<W> Bit early to play for moyo, but the move is good, it gets you outside influence.]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[ep];W[eo];B[gp];W[fo];B[dk];W[mq]C[jjayjay:  kind of panic revenge. I should not do this. It was a bluff, because I was angry about myself for the bad shape in the lower left and that I wasn't able to secure the poit black just played.

<W> The lower left is fine, stable as can be, and the corner is good enough. Here you should punish black by pushing his stone dropped inside your heavy influence around. D11 looks good, certainly push him towards your bottom corner group instead of away from it.]
;B[np]C[<W> He answered, so all is well.];W[or]C[<W> When you make moves like this, you have to consider if you really want a fight. What will you gain from fighting here, beyond competing over a relatively small territory? I can see no gain.]
;B[pr];W[hp]C[jjayjay: don't know why. I just like this wedges :-) Actually I thought I could either connect, or have some agi for the poor invaders on the lower right.

<W> Yeah this move is good, the followup, not so much...];B[go]
C[<W> You should have had your response to this worked out. G3 seems the only play.]

(;W[fm]LB[fm:A][gq:B];B[hq];W[gn];B[ho];W[hn];B[cn];W[io]C[<W> This move does nothing but remove the aji of the H4 stone. Answer black!]
;B[ip];W[ci]C[<W> Good move.];B[cj];W[di]C[<W> Excellent for you, blacks biggest mistake so far. Your top left is huge.]
;B[bp];W[bq]C[jjayjay: well, that was of no use here I think, except for some support to the d5 cut.. I should have rather enclose black in the lower left and keep my groups l(loosely) connected.

<W> This does not support D5. If you're worried about the cut, connect (pretty fundamental, but something the best of us miss,) at D5 directly or C5/D6.]

(;B[cp]LB[do:B][cp:A];W[dn];B[co];W[cm]C[jjayjay: again better connect I think.

<W> Yes, black can cut here.];B[bm];W[re]C[jjayjay: ouhwouh, I will be beaten for that one, won't I? I humbley admit, this move was played brainlessly and out of an illusion of predominance. BTW, heres my top 3 of biggest problems that I feel to have in playing go:
1) count accurately ( and therefore: don't fall in panic when there is no reason for it!!!),
2) see what is *really* going on on the board in terms of (weak) groups, (secure) territory and influence. (well, thats waht go is all about,isn't it?)
3)  and finally : be creative!! This one hurts me most, because in contrast to the first 2 points, I feel that this is something hard to be learned....



<W> Don't panic, even when there is reason for it! When you are behind you can play risky, but you should still have a plan. Totally wild moves that you have no idea where is going will only sement the victory for your opponent, if he knows to stick to his fundamentals.

<W> If you're truly so behind that only a wild chance will save you, resign.]
;B[qh];W[oi]C[jjayjay: OK, here I have to defend myself. Along the whole game, the performance of the IGS interface was awfully. I don't know if it was my computer, the application or the internet connection, but it really was a mess. So I sometimes dropped to early, or clicked more than one time, and the result was a missplacement like this. It should be Q11 but actually the result of this move wasn't to bad...

<W> I see no reason to defend the lone stone. Black has used too many moves covering it already, just leave it be, and later push for more outside influence/territory by threatening to do something with it.

<W> Also, this is where the D5 cut remains open.]
(;B[pi];W[oh]C[<W> Perfect for you, black should have split you instead of capturing.]
;B[jo]C[jjayjay: big one.];W[lo]C[jjayjay: running out. Maybe I should rather secure the left with something like e10 for a real international airport :-)

<W> F9 looks good, block black in.];B[lp];W[mp];B[mo]C[<W> You are cut, read it out and face the truth. You CAN live small, by solidifying black on the outside. Better I think to lock black in by _threatening_ to live.]
;W[kp];B[lq];W[kq];B[lr];W[kr];B[ko];W[ln];B[mr];W[nq];B[nr]
;W[no];B[oq]C[jjayjay:  ah... concerning porblems in go ...did i mention 4) do not play because you are to lazy to count!?

<W> No comment.];W[mn];B[mp];W[in];B[gc]C[<W> This is your chance, chase black and in doing so, get a huge territory. Face the fact that you will probably not kill him tho, and play such that you will still win even if you don't.]
;W[dj]C[<W> Black shouldn't worry about this, now he can get a base at the top!]
;B[cl];W[hc]C[<W> Too close, don't give black the chance to play solid and keep you weak.]
;B[eb];W[db];B[hb];W[ib];B[ic];W[jc];B[id]C[jjayjay: Misstake of b I think.

<W> Clearly. He should capture one of the white stones.];W[hd]
;B[ie];W[jb];B[ge];W[gb];B[gd];W[ha];B[he];W[hb]C[<W> No need to defend there, the best black can get is the two prisoners and two more liberties; the eye is false.]
;B[cg];W[bi]C[<W> As long as black has D7, he shouldn't worry about this. Better to play out.]
;B[dg];W[fh];B[eh];W[fi];B[fg];W[ee]C[jjayjay:  tried not to let b come up with a living shape.

<W> Then E14 is much better than E15. He can now play E14 himself at some stage, and have two half eyes with one stroke.]
;B[ff];W[hg]C[<W> Good shape, but a bit weak; you are getting very disconnected.]
;B[jf];W[jh]C[<W> Very nice of black, to help your weaknesses like that.]
;B[lg];W[og]C[jjayjay: no. this was to overconcentrated. I think I should rather keep closer like  m15 or m11. Or close some gaps, I just realize that k6 or l6 would have been sente.... what a pitty.


<W> A solid wall when chasing your opponent isn't overconcentration.]
;B[fk]C[jjayjay: A good one.];W[fj];B[hl];W[gk];B[gl];W[fl]
;B[ek];W[hk]C[<W> This is a thank-you-move for black. Better to play safe, like K10, or simply G10.]
;B[il]C[<W> Now you must save your corner group, AND kill black on the top. I would play D5 first, see how black respons, if he will let me live in the corner and surround me, or force me to run out with K7. Face the fact that it's likely either J8 or J15 will live, and see which is larger...]
;W[kn]C[<W> Wrong direction. Play K6 if you must make such a crude threat.]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[jp]
(;W[jl]LB[jl:A][im:B]C[<W> This only aids black. Play solid, J7]
;B[ik];W[jj];B[ij];W[hi];B[jk];W[kk];B[ji];W[kj];B[ii];W[ih]
;B[ki];W[bg]C[<W> Why the discontinuity here? Keep pushing black, or the game is lost! If you wish to kill the top, press between the black groups at L12. Now black can connect, and have a much easier fight.]
;B[bf];W[kh]C[<W> Yes.];B[li];W[lh];B[im]C[jjayjay: ok, now b takes advateges of the plenty of cuts I left....

<W> Nothing to help it, too many ommited moves. Black should be dead on the top tho, so you can use your sente to try to grab something on the right.]
;W[ml];B[kl];W[km];B[lk];W[ll];B[lj];W[kl];B[do]C[jjayjay: I should have connect here when cut at J7, this would have left more potential to the J8 group. Heck, 17k was a lot of weaker when I was young!!! ;-)


<W> Don't play expecting your opponent to make mistakes. If you see a flaw in your play, fix it, don't gamble on it going unnoticed.]
;W[bh];B[be];W[bd];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[dd];B[ad];W[bb];B[ab]
C[<W> No worries for you, just connect D18 to G18, and black has no eyes.]
;W[ac];B[lc];W[ob]C[(163)jjayjay:  I was running out of time here, which was a pitty because there were a lot of fights possible now. I think the b invasion in the upper right was quite under control, but some fights were possible at the lower right and I really messed up with the lower left. So after all, I think I allready was behind, even if I could manage to keep the big upper left.


<W> You are some 20 points behind, probably too much to retake in the endgame.


Thanks a lot for any commentary, and sorry for any pain I left ;-) 

Finally, I would deeply appreciate any soul that would give me some teaching lessons. just contact me on jyjy@gmx.de. Thanks and good night.

(;B[oh];W[pi];B[nh]C[<W> Horrible for you compared to actual play. Forget saving stones, and rather look at the weak group/strong group dynamic, and who can push where.]

(;B[do]LB[do:B][cp:A]
(;W[co];B[dn];W[bo];B[fk]C[<W> You would be in trouble here, and black can use the chase to build up strength to launch into your top.]

(;B[qe];W[pc]C[<W> There are no ko threats in the opening.]
