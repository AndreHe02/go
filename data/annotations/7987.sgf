AB[pd][dp];W[pp]C[Dear Reviewer:

I feel I have played a bit too slowly and a bit too clumsily in quite a few part of this game. I would appreciate any comments that addresses that. Also, if this is not too much trouble, could you go particularly over direction and timing of play, and invasion?

Thank you very much in advance.

I'll try my best :-)];B[dd];W[nc]C[I think the white move here on the other side is due to the handicaps. I think I should have played around M17, M16 to increase the efficiency of my stones, but I am not comfortable with fighting this early.

Is this a mistake? What should black due to take advantage?

While your answer is a kind of "can't be bad' move (which means well played!) M17 is also a good idea. see var

My feeling about M16 here is, that you shouldn't try anything complicated whithout resaon and especially not in a handicap game (R14 and M17 are both quite easy to understand)]

C[What's the best way for black to handle this?
 P14 or not so nice L14 directly

Your situation is qutie comfortabe since b is alive or allmost (on both sides)
The idea should be to make w 2 weak groups, which sees possible]
(;B[md];W[nd];B[lf];W[ng];B[lb]C[this is a slow move (does what you wanted to do), but i wouldn't even think about this move

(;B[cj]C[I felt the white group is weak, and my black group is strong enough to live or escape. So, I am planning to chase the white middle group down. Before that I want to prepare the ground work a bit. If I coule, I would also like to put pressure on the white group on the upper right.

Your thoughs are very good, but the the move is too soon
see var];W[hf]
(;B[jf]C[Is this a mistake in the overall game? I think this is a good local move, but slow overall.

your plan seems still to hunt w, which is not possible anymore, so better jump to M12

A ist the correct move, it's sente];B[de];W[dg];B[bf];W[bg]

But this looks more like another weak group];W[fe];B[ei]C[Create a bit of moyo, also limit the white wall. It's not a live strictly, but it has many liberties. I don't think I can kill white, but I want to be able to profit while white tries to live.


Main problem here is, that w is not sealed in. So for me w is more hunting the middle group than the other way round. Still this move is quite necessesary only showing that the F14 cut was an overplay)]
;W[ig]C[the only move];B[kh];W[ii];B[jh];W[ih];B[kj];W[ik]C[now the left side is not much of a moyo]
;B[ph]LB[ni:A]C[My group in the upper middle is pretty much alive. At some point i want to play around A. But, I think it's still premature, since it could connect to the right and live on the side. So, I want to give white a bit of a hard time.

[fs][qs][rs][ss]C[Some generell remarks:

1) a wide range of senseful moves following your plan (very good)
2) good calculation about what will or can happen
3) try more to connect your groups (just count your 6 alive groups against 2 w groups) and let this be more part of your plans
4) as a lot of players sometimes your focus is too much on attacking, when you have own weak groups (best is to have 0 or maximum 1 weak group)
5) quite often in this game you got your plan working, without getting any advance; therefore you have to rethink about your plans (that's not easy and more or less every amateurs problem)

Nice game to review (even I got not really so much time for analysing), I hope I could help a bit.
If any questions, feel free to ask (my account on KGS is pet, you can also leave a message there).

Best wishes,
Peter Schwartzkopff])
