  joelr 9k*: thanks, you too.];B[nd];W[qn];B[qk];W[on];B[ok]C[B should probably O4 or O3 here]
;W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[qr];W[rq]C[I think w gets a better result from s2]
;B[rr];W[qo];B[nq];W[mq];B[nr]C[w should probably just cover the cut with N4]

C[O8 here would connect b groups, then w would have 3 weak group];W[pl]
;B[pk];W[ol];B[nl];W[nk]C[I think cut should not work eg it is unreasonable, but this is h4 game , so ....]
;B[ll];W[mk];B[lm]C[I usually try to get more, so L7 keeps connection but extends b a little more putting more pressure on bottom w group.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[oj];B[qi];W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[rm];W[rk];B[ql];W[qm];B[rj]
;W[sp];B[dj]C[looks like b needs one more move on right for life, say q10 w o10,  b s8]
;W[lc];B[ld];W[oc];B[od];W[mc];B[pc]C[I would be inclined to play O17 instead]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[md];B[qe];W[rf];B[re];W[rl];B[sk];W[pj];B[qj];W[rn];B[sl]
;W[si]C[b dead, so d10 and s15 unreasonable, too greedy];B[kd];W[ni]C[w afraid of N10 cut but probably not too much of a problem
I think w m10 then and probably capture the cutting stones];B[jq];W[jo]
;B[hp];W[ho];B[gp];W[kk];B[jm];W[il]C[w gets very careless with liberties in the next few sequences, also white is pushing b group into weak white group.  White should push the other way to strengthen white bottom group.]
;B[im];W[hl];B[hm];W[gm];B[hn];W[go];B[gn];W[fo];B[fn]C[I played out several sequences here.  Seems white did the best he could considering the previous moves.]
;W[fp];B[fq];W[eq];B[fr];W[er]C[e2 seems unreasonable];B[ep];W[gq]C[j4 critical, J5 good b move]
;B[io];W[ip];B[eo];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir];B[jp];W[kn]C[B should k8 here];B[hr]
;W[km];B[kl];W[kr]C[b had another opportunity to connect here, but ...]
;B[is];W[kq];B[hq];W[jl]C[not a bad recovery for w, but b gained alot];B

  joelr 9k*: may i have more time?];W[jj]C[
  mothra 5k*: sure];B[hd]C[I think b l17 before H16, w must N15.];W[df]

[ck];W[cn];B[bp];W[el];B[fl];W[dk];B[ek];W[bk];B[cj];W[bj];B[ci]C[This looks not so good, probably better to d8, then can b11 instead of c11]
