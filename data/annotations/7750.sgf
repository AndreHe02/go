C[G: Hello! I'm your personal reviewer, Gergely. :) My comments marked by G: I hope my comments will be proven to be useful.

This is a game I recently played. I felt I might have been able to win the game in the endgame if I had played better.

But sometimes I run into these types of games were I feel I have played badly before that, but do not see how I should have played better. I try to review every game I play myself. But this game I feel I need some advice on. I felt my whole board strategy should have been better.]
;B[pc]C[My opponent is black, 7 kyu.];W[cd]C[I am white, 6 kyu.]
;B[qp];W[dq];B[ec];W[de];B[jc];W[fd];B[gc]C[I believe black should have played f17? How to respond here? I felt I made things a little bit complicated here for myself and should have just played simple..

G: I think its ok to continue your plan of pressing opponent into low position. F17 extra liberty would come handy if black wants to cut at e16 (so you can use geta or ladder). Of course aji of f17 will remain for you. Its unlikely black will connect here and now.]
;W[fc];B[fb];W[gd];B[hc];W[db];B[eb]
(;W[fg]C[G: Nice deffense. However i would exted on the right side instead. Of course black can cut. But what if you give 3 stones to build a huge wall ? (consider your would-be-played extension stone)]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[fe];W[ge];B[qj];W[op];B[mp];W[on];B[qn];W[qq]
;B[rq];W[pq];B[rr];W[jp];B[mn];W[ol];B[ql]C[From here and onwards I feel I did not play as good as I should. I feel I should have attacked the two hanging stones (b23 and b31) better, but instead make black strong.]
;W[ml];B[kn];W[lo]LB[hp:A]C[G: Its reminds me some kind of joseki, however black stones on line N and L would have been on M and K. 
Anyway, M5 isnt seems to be good timeing. Simply strengthen your position at h4 (for expl) and any play on the left side will be huge. Black second group of weak stones will be waiting for their destiny.]
;B[ln];W[mo];B[no];W[nn];B[np];W[oo];B[kp]
(;W[nq]LB[lq:A]C[G: Aji keshi? Why strengthen black. White cannot be cut and escaped into the center. No danger. After O3/N3 exchange there is no play at M3, what would be a great forcing move]
;B[mq]C[G: white forced black into a good shape!  K4 has weakened. White P4 group got nothing. no good. :(]
;W[mm]TR[ni]C[G: you shouldnt give up sente now. Exchange k5 for L5 and extend on the left side. Or invade at Q15. White group is ok for now (its firmly connected). Even if you feel bad about your group, do not try to build shape directly. Extend, jump out, create strength in the center.]
;B[hp];W[jo];B[ko];W[do]C[G: How much better would it look, if you can relocate your N7 stone at H5 now...]
;B[hn];W[dj];B[jn]C[G: Its slow.  time to take sente];W[gq]
C[G: ok, but i feel upper right more important. You have shimari (bottom left) If you ruin black's opportunity to create a comparable moyo, you will take the lead. Save g3 for later time. (please consider you are "attacking" a super strong absolutely living black group. There is a high risk you end up in gote. In fact its 100%.)]
;B[hq];W[gp];B[go];W[fo];B[fn];W[eo];B[qf];W[mc]TR[me][nj]C[G: Yes, white surely must do something. But I would expect a hat at n15, followed by an another attack on lower right group.  Hard time.]
;B[nr]C[G: bad timeing for black. Good opportunity for white. White is definitely not in danger. Ignore and deffend your invasion.]
;W[id]TR[mf][fn][hn][jn][kn][ln]C[G: You shouldnt bother to press down black now. Its doesnt matter anymore. Saving your invasion stone is more important. Maybe if J16 would finish a huge moyo, i would say umm..umm..ok, but its only strengthens black. (please consider black stronghold on the other side) 

G: What about jump out lightly destroying center potential and connecting towards your other group?]
;B[ic]C[G: of course black should answer at K16 instead (or  ignore and tenuki)]
;W[jd];B[lc];W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[kc];W[le]TR[me]C[G: I'd prefer double indirect connection here.]
;B[hd];W[he];B[ie];W[je];B[if];W[ff]TR[hg]C[G: Is it neccessary? What about H14 instead? (g7 forcing move is always there to create imposing moyo...)]
;B[ii]
(;W[jg]TR[ig]C[G: ok. Black chose to flee lightly. We shouldnt attack it immediately. Let black to worry about her/his badly placed weak stones, stabilize our shape on the top, maybe try to get some territory in sente and THEN chase them.

G: Anyway, if you really really want to kill those cutting sones, you should start az j13 nose tesuji.]
;B[ig];W[jh];B[ih];W[pe];B[qe];W[pd];B[qd];W[oc];B[pb]C[G: I feel you want to try to create territory in the center. Its impossible. Never good idea to try to make territory with weak stones in the enemy area of influence. White is ok in territory. Primary goal is to make life. Secondary goal is to destroy as many territory as possible. 
G: Instead of makeing forcing moves like these, you should stabilize your two hanging group in the center and then attack (what is left). Consider that if you dont force black to convert the side into territory , It still might be invaded AND of course, after white center groups are stabilized, black center group can be nicely attacked. Black cannot save both...]
;W[pf];B[pg];W[og];B[oh];W[ng];B[nh];W[mg]C[My group below is in trouble...

G: True. Thats why you should try to make strong (connected) center group and target attacking black (center or right side) instead of territory. Notice that white got about ten points in gote. Black  has got the same on the side. (At least)]
;B[ji];W[mh];B[mi];W[ki];B[kj];W[li];B[lj];W[ph];B[nj];W[pi]
C[G: White lower right seems to be  dead now. Forget every other plan, find a way to live or surrender.]
;B[qg];W[ni];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[nk];B[mj]
(;W[pj]TR[pm]C[G: There is no use to make a dead group bigger. What about q7 to live?]

;B[hj]
(;W[im]LB[lk:A]SQ[ie][if][ig][ih][ii][ji][hj][ij][hk]C[G: after M8 sente connection trying to kill the whole center group seems to be a better idea. White should win the semai.]

;B[lp];W[or];B[mr];W[qr];B[jq]C[G: Black missed the kill. (K3 not neccessary, white)  A New Hope emerges.]
;W[ps];B[qm]LB[mb:F][ob:B][dc:C][jf:G][fj:D][em:A][hr:E]C[How to play better engame from here? I have tried some variations and feel I might have gotten a couple of points lead if played correctly, but then again, I might not have seen the best moves for black.

G: The time when you think only endgame left, its worth to stop and analyize. What left? What is sente? What are continuations? I've marked big endgame points left (a pro supposely would die in hideous laughter, but it will takes for now :))  After you've identified all good endgame moves, try to make an order. Of course sente is very important now, but try to consider your opponent point of view. Big forcing moves (security holes) like G or A might be worth to protect even in gote. 

I would try 'A', then 'D' or  'E', 'B',  'C' ...];W[gr];B[hr]

[fh:D][pp:C][hs:A]C[k14 clearly bigger. I must have been blind at this stage.

G: Well, A and B also are much bigger even C or D are would profit more, since they has good continuations (so they might become sente).]

G: Even if you think it kills (of course not) always choose solid connection over three eyes. One less ko threat. Of course it doesnt matter here but its good to used to that.]

[js][ks][ls][ms][ss]C[Any further comments on how to impove? I read a lot of tsumegos. Look through commented pro games from time to time. I check out internetgoschool audio-lectures and read the odd book on strategy. I have been steadily improving now for a while. But fear progress will go much slower from now since I do not have any other direct thought on how to improve more other then doing tsumegos etc.

G: I think this despite some errors in the course this game might be won by a good endgame. Anyway doing tsumegos and replaying pro games are always good. Just continue it. You will beat me badly soon :)
1. Maybe some book about endgame would help you to improve.
2. Be very sceptic about center territories. (please look on the board now, what left?)  A rule of thumb: if there is a center area surrounded less than 3/4, thats not a territory. They are dame points. :)
3. Even in the hottest games, its worth to take a break sometimes, shake your head and try to watch the board by new thoughts: What are my weak groups? What are my opponent's weak groups? What are their relationships? Can I profit from eliminating my weaknesses?

Happy playing!
