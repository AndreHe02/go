C[Greetings!

This is a game from this Croatian Open Championship played on 13.07.2014.
Time is 1h15m per player, with 30s/5 byoyomi.
I play as white here. The game record is not complete, but it goes to the beginning of yose (and byoyomi) and most of the decisions were done by then (and I got into trouble long before then)

I will add my thoughts and questions to the moves on which I wondered if I was making the right call, feel free to point out if anything else seems weird/overlooked or just plain bad of course :)
--
Hi,

Thanks for sending this game into me for review.

I will note comments as I review the game and then go back and add further comments with the benefit of hindsight.  I will flag all comments added later so you can see which ones were not obvious to me on the first look through.

Corrin];B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[qe]C[Not sure if this is the modern way to deal with this opening, but I guess it's playable? (I did expect a B pincer though)
--
A loose pincer is most common but I have allso seen responses such as P16.]
;B[pe];W[pf];B[oe];W[qd];B[qc];W[of];B[ne];W[qj]C[I guess playing this kind of joseki here is uncommon, but I don't know if there was any better way to handle the situation?
I pushed at P14 once to extend a line further towards the shimari (otherwise I would've extended to R11 only), and I felt that the added strength of P14 makes later black approach at R8 less of a sente (see variation).
--
I think you can be happy with this start.  Black's top shape is less interesting thatn white's shape on the right.  You have natural extensions towards black's shimari whie the top woulld just lead to you playing C15.]

(;B[hd]C[This is how the game continued...
--
Seems fine for you.];W[jc]C[I thought H16 was an overextension, and that there is enough maneuvering space here not to create a too weak group.
--
This is the first move of yours where I would have played differently.  To me the top side is not as large as the left side.  Say you play D15, black still has the weakness at K17 and so needs to support H16 somehow next move.  Black playing F17 doesn't help K17 enough so black wil have to do something different and leave F17 unplayed, and I can't find a natural move for back.  Something like L16 feels too small for this early in the game.]
;B[lc];W[je];B[de];W[fd]C[Aiming to divide the black stones, I thought this was pretty much the only good way to handle the situation? (if I play from the corner side, black would still remain decently strong on the outside not to be a target and then I would have to worry about my K15 stones)
--
Yes, this makes sense to me.  I spent quite a long time wondering about black's next move and read out many variations but your moves so far feel natural and normal.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd]
(;W[eb]C[--
I had assumed without reading that you would play H17 instead of E18 here.  Looking more closelly you can also play H15 and sacrifice K15 for the connection underneath.  It gives black a lot of centrall thickness but you get sente so can largely nullify that by playing N13.]
;B[cg];W[ff]C[Considering that C13 was oddly narrow, I wanted to reduce the aji of H16 stone and aim at C11 or D12 later.

Still, the move seems a little bit slow :/
--
I would have played H15 to fully wrap up H16.  Remember black has chosen the really solid C13 rather than extending further, so I think you can choose solid too.]
;B[fp]
(;W[fq]C[It is obvious that black is trying to build a moyo around the shimari here, but instead of pincering I thought the peaceful division gives me a big safe corner as well as sente to go back and harass the C13 group, which should result in enough compensation on the side (D4-D10 side).
--
Either way feels fine to me.

With the C13 group strong there is very litte interest in getting a white stone at C11 so this route seems fine.]
;B[gq];W[eq];B[hp];W[dn]C[Normally I might play low at C6 not to give black C8, but in this case it seemed that black will want to finish the joseki and take his side.
Also, if he did play C8 now, I guess replying around C11 would split black into two weak groups for a fight that favors white (as well as leave black's side towards the shimari open to invasion).
--
I would have played low here myself but I see where you're coming from.  To be honest I'm now thinking that maybe F3 wasn't such a good idea.]
;B[kq]C[--
That is more solid than I had expected.  I think you can be pretty happy]
;W[ci]C[My aim was to secure the side in sente while black settles this group, and then return to play R6 or R7.

Looking back, I believe this was a mistake, and R6 or R7 was much more urgent now?
--
For sure! I was extremely surprised you didn't play R6/R7 (I would personallly R7).  You've played a couple moves that I would have done differently, but this is the first move I really disagree with your move.

After reviewing the game I feel even more strongly about this move.  To here I think you're doing fine but after this things start to go badly.  You don't have a good attack on C13 so this move doesn't work well as sente, but black extending from R4 makes that moyo a concern and significantly weakens the upper right.]
;B[ql]C[However, Black tenukied, and now I had to follow up the attack.]

(;W[bb]C[Instead of this, I also considered simply enclosing black with e.g. E12 and then expect to have black live with e.g. B11-B10-B12-C10(?) but with that he lives in sente(?) and goes on to play around G7 and his moyo turns too big while my enclosure thickness doesn't really have much use.
--
With C11 this isolated you can't kill... This move could be ok if it leads to C11 becoming strong and tying nicely to D6, but otherwise I wonder if say P9 or P5 would have been better.]
;B[eg];W[ei];B[fg];W[gg]C[--
I would have played H14 to keep H16's aji to a minimum.  I'm not sure it's better though, this seems fine.]
;B[gh]
(;W[hg];B[fi];W[ej];B[ef]C[I probably should've played this move first...
--
Yes, I was looking at that.  But you needed to play H13 first.  However you could have forced with it before playing E10.]

(;W[fe];B[ol]C[And now I begin to really worry.
The black moyo is becoming too big, and I now have a serious weakness at R12.
If I play P10 to protect that weakness, I feel black adds another move around G7 and there is no way for white to win anymore.
--
Yes, the game has gone from looking good to bad very quickly.

You have to invade the lower lleft or the game is over, a small reduction will not be enough to win.  I think you'lll just have to put up with R12.]
;W[jo]C[After careful consideration, this seemed like a good spot to reduce.
I'm still looking at J3, or possibly some kind of K3 disconnect, in which case I have a target to attack (G3 stones), or - provided black protects - I can flatten the moyo with e.g. M5 and make a light group in the center which can run to either the left or the top (possibly even right, if I get to play around O10 or P10 first.

My reasoning is that if I manage to do the reduction here in sente so as not to suffer a big loss around R12, with this reduction the game is still relatively even?
--
I would have invaded and lived small rather than reduced myself.  I like your invasion point because K3 eliminates black's temptation to simply reply by solidifying the remaining moyo but capturing K5 is unrealistic.]
;B[fn];W[lo]C[Black counters so I flatten the moyo and try to strengthen my group.
--
Sure.  I would have payed S2 I think.  It's now much less attractive for black to let you live small, this move makes your reduction just a littlle heavy.]
;B[mp];W[iq]C[If black tries to cut with J4, I'm looking at the K3-M3 aji (see variation)
--
Yes, seems fine.  I would expect black to not cut since just G2 on its own makes the cut a bit pointless.  I think black will simply answer H2 - you connecting out via K3 is then a little heavy

I think I would have played O6 instead just because J3 can be played any time.]

(;B[hr];W[lp]C[--
I find this move interesting.  When reviewing the game for the first time I did not see cutting H2 off from L3 as being so important, but you made it work well.]
;B[lq];W[mo]C[--
I don't like this move - exchanging N5 for O4 seems to do nothing for you.]

(;B[no]C[I think this was a B mistake. If he just played O4 I would not be able to cut off his stones as in the game.
Any advice on how to better treat this reduction is more than welcome, as I was still in panic mode here and not really sure how to settle this group decently.
--
Ok, you got a bit lucky here.  Cutting off F6 is going to fix the weakness of K5 nicely.]
;W[nn];B[oo];W[mq];B[np];W[jq];B[kp];W[ko];B[mr];W[kr]C[--
This doesn't add anything and seems to cost a ko threat?];B[lr]

(;W[io]C[Now this group is starting to look relatively healthy (even though it's still behind enemy lines) but B also has to worry about the G3 stones so I felt like I have a chance again.]
;B[fl]C[Troublesome move. I don't see a good way to disconnect black from joining up (without letting him into my side in the process).
--
You don't need to prevent the disconnection.  If you can solidify the left at no real cost and finish with sente then you will have fully caught up.]
;W[em];B[fm];W[ij]C[I see that there is lots of aji around C9/D8, but I thought black might severely attack my center group now if I left it unsupported, so this move aimed at both helping out my center, and making the F10 cut more severe (hoping that black protects the cut now).
--
I think that sequence went welll for you.  It's a shame you can no longer invade at S4 and live in ko but you've got a good chance of getting P10 now.

I think you do need to do something to support J5 now.  I'm not sure what, but this seems ok.]
;B[dk]C[Instead, black invades, and I'm in trouble again.


(note: I didn't like directly cutting at E9 here because it didn't seem good, I couldn't read it out, and didn't want to stake the game on such an unknown - see variation)
--
I would be tempted  cut directy.  Even if you have to sacrifice the cutting stone and use it to connect underneath.

In review, this is a really hard move to respond to.  You have a lot of aji to consider - the peep at C5, the weakness of F11 and the weakness of F4.  

I think all things considered I would and play D8.  The cut is tempting but the aji makes it so complex and I don't like that - it's all complexity which could turn out badly for you but not complexity which could turn out really well for you.]

(;W[ck]C[I thought if I just connect down, B still has to protect F10 in some form to connect his groups, and the game is still ok.]
;B[dl];W[el]C[Now it seems I can cut, so I do...
--
This move seems contrary to C9.  I think you're better to cut last move or not at all.  Also I don't think cutting here works now]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[fj]
(;W[gk];B[dj]C[At this moment I am seriously tempted to let go of these stones and just play a move around H7 to seal the G3 group, but I would have to kill it to justify letting go of the side, and I don't see the killing combination (black still has lots of aji with J2, F2, E6, H6).

Looking back, I probably should have done that, because even if black lives it would be gote and I can come back and finish D9 group, while having a much better situation on the outside.
--
Yes, say you play H7 now, how does black live there? 

To be fair, you should be able to do that stilll provided you deal with the left in sente.

I experimented quite a bit with sequences from here]
(;W[di];B[co]C[This was painful and I saw no good response. Any ideas?
--
There is no easy answer here.  I would probably connect and try to make miai of killing F8 or D8.]

(;W[cm]C[I decided to not connect the peep and let B run a spike into my side counting that in return I get the following:
- his top left group becomes prone to attack
- my left stones are absolutely safe and connected thus helping the center group
- even if B runs into the side, he still can't guarantee to have an eye there, so will probably end with gote to make his group live

This analysis was either overly optimistic, or I played the following few moves really badly :(
--
Ouch!  now the kill on F8 is gone.  Locally I prefer D7];B[do]
;W[eo];B[en];W[dm];B[ep];W[cq]C[I think this was the correct move but not sure?
If I play C4 black gets a lot more aji (such as D3 cut immediately).
--
Yes, this is the correct move locally - otherwise you have to come back and play D2.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[fr];W[bq]C[Threatening to connect at B5, but technically with all the threats B now has against the corner he should have no problem making life with his group?]
;B[bp];W[go];B[fo];W[er];B[hi]C[Considering the urgent moves in bottom left, this move surprised me.
It's a threat towards H9 though...
--
It surprises me too.  H9 is not very interesting any more, black has a gote eye at A4, not to mention the L+1 ko.]
;W[gl]C[...so I followed up like this, threatening to activate the G4 cut]
;B[ho];W[gn]C[Looking back, I think this crawl was a mistake. Probably something like J7 was better?
(letting black live but securing the center and taking sente for e.g. P10)

Also, I keep looking the top left B group and can't read it out - is there a way to eliminate B's eyes so that he is forced to flee to the center?
--
I would not have played this.  You can't kill, too much aji, so I woulld definatey have protected with say J7 and invited black to live in gote.

Pausing here.  Say instead of G6 you played an ordinary move like J11, how's the score looking? Black has 45 in the lower right, and 20 in the upper right but almost no points elsewhere.  You have 10 in the lower left, 30 in the upper left, 10 on the right and the potential to extend the right easily with moves like P10.  Overall the game feels like you're behind but not by that much.]
;B[gm];W[hn];B[hm];W[in];B[gp]
(;W[fs]C[Another mistake?
I was looking at J8 now instead, but didn't find a good way to make it work. From what I see there's a semeai resulting from it and it didn't look favorable (see variation).
--
It's interesting.  When reviewing the game initially I had thought you were being too ambitious, that black's position was too strong.  However looking at it again I'm not so sure.

The lower left is ko currently but with black's weakness at F2 it's not an easy ko for black - I've played it out in the J8 variation for completeness.]
;B[il];W[kl]C[At this point I felt like I played something very wrong in this whole fight, as I let B into the side and didn't cash it in anywhere. In addition, I hurt my center group in the process.
Now I just wanted to save my group and hopefully get to play around P10 first.

(B has no eyes yet but can connect his groups due to shortage of liberties of W's G9 stones)]
;B[hj]
(;W[hk]C[Again mistake, losing sente AND hurting center more.
I think I entered byoyomi here.
--
To me the game is over already.  You can't kill black so are too far behind.]
;B[ik];W[cl];B[jj];W[kj];B[ii];W[nk];B[gr];W[bs]C[Not sure if necessary?
Getting to play e.g. P9 or P10 now would be huge?
--
Well from a yose perspective it's easy to count roughly  18 stones * 2 = 36 points.  But it's ko so it's halved, or back to 18 points.  It's not exactly a simple ko due to the seki black is allowed which makes exact value really hard to give but it's pretty big.  I think P9 is bigger personally. Something like M15 might be interesting since it could probably be sente.

The other thing to consider is the score.  I appreciate you're in byo-yomi now but you have to agree you feel quite a way behind.  So why not take a risk and grab some points - hope black gets less points in the ko than are deserved, or gives you back sente and you get this move in too.]
;B[pj];W[pi];B[oj];W[qk]C[Risky, but I feel I'm behind on points so I have to.
--
Yes for sure.];B[pl];W[oi];B[nj];W[li]C[This is where the game record ends.
I was in byoyomi and things went quite fast from now on...

In the end, I lost the L8-L10-M11 stones so B got quite a bit of points in the center, but the central W group did make 2 eyes and has survived.
As compensation, I got to play M18 first, as well as the S8 and S17 hane, and squeezed a 3.5 pt win. However, I feel this was more luck as I was in so much trouble most of the game. I let B build the moyo too easily, and then lost a lot in the fight following the reduction.

Problem is, I have no idea what caused those troubles.
Did I waste too many moves threatening the B top left group? (and then failed to even attack it properly)
Did I reduce B's moyo in a wrong way? (I felt like B could've attacked my reduction much more severely)
Was there some aji to use in the bottom right shimari itself after B R8? I felt like I was too passive in that part of the board, but didn't find a good way to do anything there considering my R12 weakness.

Many thanks if you take the time to review this game!
--
I think the big thing was allowing the lower right to develop in exchange for the less interesting C11.  I think black made a fair number of mistakes which gave you the opportunity to catch up, and maybe even to catch the F4 dragon.

Your style was interesting, it's riskier than mine.  I missed how important cutting off F4 was and I missed how close the black dragon came to dying there - it just felt black had enough space and helpful aji, so I didn't bother reading it.  Lastly the choice to let black break through at D5 with a single eye isn't one I thought of - I was concentrating only on minimising point loss.

One thing to consider is the invasion rather than just reducing.  I think it would have been a good choice here and probably suits your high-stakes style.   Along similar lines I think you should probably have known you were behind when it came to B1 and risked omitting it.  Either you live easily but leave black too far ahead on points, or catch up but risk death and an instant loss. 

I hope that helps, it was an interesting game to review. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions.  Also I'm trying a new editor (SgfEditor) so please let me know if there's any problems with the SGF.
