C[Hello
This game I played at kgs, and since I'm just learnig how to play, some words of somebody more experienced is a lot worthy for me! I's like to hear all your comments.
Thank u!

Llywelyn: You're welcome, I hope this helps :-)

A few things to focus on for the future:

1) Urgent before big--don't tenuki when your opponent is breathing down your neck and can do a lot of damage by playing in that area next.

2) Keep an eye on the global theatre--don't get caught making small moves early in the game.

3) Watch for ladders and learn how to read them effectively.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fq];B[mc]TR[cl]LB[bp:A]C[Llywelyn: Urgent before big :-)  A white pincer at the marked location would give white a lot of influence and cut out most of your hope of making  a base.  "a" is a good alternative move for you.]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[bp]C[Llywelyn: Ah! There it is!]
;W[cq];B[ck];W[qf];B[of]C[Llywelyn: This is begging for an invasion at R16,  R17, or S16.  Defense is key here.  A better play would have been R16 or perhaps R15 (though contact plays are generally frowned on).]
;W[rd];B[qc]C[I think that probably this one is not the best move

Llywelyn: It is small for this stage of the game, still a good move to keep in mind for later.]
;W[qi];B[ph]C[Llywelyn: This move is commiting the cardinal sin of forcing white to fix his weaknesses and build strength.]
;W[qh];B[pg]C[this is a bad hand
Am I right?

Llywelyn: It is very small and overly defensive at this stage.   Playing on the other side, at Q11, would have been a much stronger play.]
;W[ql]TR[rd][qf][qh][qi][pp]C[Llywelyn: It is worth noting what white is doing here--he is playing almost strictly a territory based game at this point and each move is just a bit greedy.  They are marching in along the third line, which is fine, but it might be time for you to take a serious look at that lower side.]
;B[jc]TR[lq][kq]MA[oo][ol]C[Was it better to play something like k3?


Llywelyn: Much :-) Though purely as  a matter of personal preference (and to give my stones more breathing room for when white attacks), I would have more likely played one of  the marked moves (triangles).  Playing either of them allows black to make a two space jump in either direction without running into a contact play and gives black more control over the base.

Another possability to consider is reducing along t he right side at one of the squares.

An invasion of the lower side at this stage could be considered "urgent" however.]
;W[mq];B[jp]TR[lp][gp]MA[ol][mo][oj][eo]C[is it too high?

Llywelyn:

No, at this poit it is wiser to reduce than to invade on this side.  A play on the fourth line is perfect.  One of the triangle-marked moves would have been stronger and give white more to chew on, but there is nothing wrong with this move.

Also look at the squares.  A reduction in any of those areas would also be good.


Keep in mind, though now is probably the wrong time for it, the 3-3 invasion at R3.]
;W[jq];B[kq]C[Llywelyn: Smallish and weak.  The stronger connection--such as one space jump on the fourth line--would have been much better here.]
;W[iq];B[kp];W[kr];B[lr];W[jr];B[lq];W[mr];B[ls];W[ms];B[mp]
C[Llywelyn: The only problem with the sequence you just went through is that every one of your moves was forced.]
;W[np];B[mo];W[no];B[nn];W[on]
(;B[mm]C[I think that this hand was good to avoid been cu at n6

Llywelyn: For this exact moment in time, you have the ladder.  See the variation for what happens if white attempts to cut--I've carried the ladder all of the way to the end for the sake of illustration.

As a rule, however, this is a good cut to prevent.  I've also included a variation of a stronger sequence that gives you much better shape and still prevents the cut without leaving the weakness in shape that white is about to take advantage of.]
;W[nm]C[Llywelyn: This is going to hurt.  White is getting a free play to extend both their territory and their influence by putting you in atari.]
;B[mn];W[nl];B[ml];W[nk];B[mk]C[Llywelyn: White is controlling the game at this point.]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[mi];B[nj]C[Interesting cut, isn't it?

Llywelyn: Premature, but yes, it is interesting :-)];W[ok]C[Llywelyn: this is an odd move.]
;B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[pi];B[mh];W[ee];B[li]C[Certainly, not the best hand, I had no hurry to capture that stones. What  would be better

Llywelyn: True, although the ladder would be something to keep in mind for white's next play--white could be devestating if they started playing off of those two stones and had a ladder-breaker.

Better plays would have been a reduction anywere along the upper or lower left-hand side.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[il]LB[ic:A]C[Llywelyn: leaving white the ability to drive an iron piller at "a" was not good as a rule, but at this stage it was good to play away--there are bigger plays out there.  Still a reduction on the upper or lower left would have been much better.]
;W[ij];B[jk];W[ip];B[io];W[ho];B[in]C[Is it correct, or was it better to play something like g7 to conect this group with the stones at c6?

Llywelyn: g7 would have made your life very difficult indeed.  This play isn't bad, but getting into this sequence is what causes you problems later.]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[gm];B[hl];W[gl];B[gk];W[gj];B[fk];W[fj];B[ek]
;W[ej];B[dj];W[di]C[Llywelyn: White is forming a very nice chunk of territory here.]
;B[kf]C[I think this one was too near.
Was it better to play a little farther like k13?];W[jf];B[je]
;W[ie];B[jg];W[ig];B[if];W[hf];B[hg]C[Llywelyn: Forcing a Ko was probably a good thing here.]
;W[ih];B[gf];W[jf];B[nq];W[nr];B[if];W[pe]C[Llywelyn: While this isn't a strong ko-threat, you seem to forget about this move later.  While it wouldn't win the game for white, it does need to be responded to.]

;B[gh];W[gi];B[fd]C[This hand sacrificed the group at f12, but killed the group at h16, was it good?

Llywelyn: It was a good read.  I'm not convinced it is a good play since it leaves you in gote, but helps your position more.]
;W[ei];B[jf];W[gg];B[fe];W[de];B[fg];W[gh];B[ef]C[Llywelyn: small capture for this stage of the game.]
;W[df];B[ff]TR[ji][od][oe]C[this hand was a disaster, since white cut my stones at p15

Llywelyn: there is no pressing need to ocnnect your two groups here--they are both either alive or can be made that way without difficulty.  I've marked a few stronger plays.]
;W[oe]C[Llywelyn: When someone makes a ko-threat that you turn down in favor the ko, examine very closely the kind of damage they can do with that stone and how to prevent it--they generally think they can do enough damage to make the ko not-worthwhile.]

White could recover everything he lost at the bottom
I was analising, and I think playing at n14 would save my position. See the variations

Llywelyn: While I agree I find your ending to the first variation to be strange.  I've commented accordingly.  With this move you seem to be trying for a ladder, since you don't have the ladder, that's bad ;-)]
