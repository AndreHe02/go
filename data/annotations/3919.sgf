C[[Review\]

Hi, this is Juhazi( about 7k in KGS but currently [-\] ) from GTL reviewing your game. I noticed that you have some problems understanding attack and defence(in other words the middle game) so I'm going to put my weight on them.

You commented that you often have creativity problems during openings. That should not be a problem as the opening has mostly been researched thoroughly by the professionals already so there is no point in being creative in your opening plays rather than follow the usual opening plays the pros have deemed equal to both sides. Of course I am not telling you to stick to them like glue since trying new things is good, but knowing some joseki or fuseki and how to follow them up is a wise choice and should balance out your game results closer to even games.

If you see any strange go words I will most likely be using you can look them up at http://senseis.xmp.net

so it's black low chinese fuseki against white san-ren-sei. Both players are saying with their stones that they want a large moyo.]
;B[fc];W[hc]C[[Review\]

The pincer:

Here the pincer is not as good as it could be if Q16 would be white. You are squeezing the black stone towards the center or the corner and so attacking him(trying to surround him).

Observe the variation for why in my opinion the pincer is not a good choice.]

(;W[dc]C[[Review\]

This move is saying that you wish to have a wall facing the upper right corner. In my opinion having a wall(see variation from previous node) facing your own hoshi stones would be better.

Knowledge about this whole joseki can be found from:

;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[cb]C[This looks like a trick move from black, placing all bets for your answer at D18.]
;W[db];B[fe]C[And this is the trick, black is quite alive in the corner and slipping through your grio on the outside!]

(;W[ee]C[If you wish to protect the cut at D15 I feel that E14 would be better. It holds to the proverb of "Attack from a distance, Defend with contact" much better. Playing a contact move on the black stones gives them as much stability as it gives you!]
;B[gd];W[kd]C[Very good, defend the weak stone and at the same time attack the black weak group.

Can you see now how much better your pincer would be if Q16 had been white? That is also a reason why L16 should be on the 3rd row... Now it is easy to slide under the stone and attack you instead of you attacking!]
;B[mc]C[See? A bit early from black but still quite effective.

How to punish black? Easy, by running away. see the variation.]

(;W[lc]C[Defend with contact. Good choice too.];B[hd];W[ic]
C[Why not hane on J16 instead of J17? You need to squeeze black tight in order to win, not give him space with extension at J17.]
;B[id];W[jc]C[Again the same, hane instead of extend. Extend is for when you need stability and are winning.]
;B[md];W[kf];B[bg];W[bh];B[hg];W[ff]C[Contact plays are not good for attack. You need to attack from farther away.]
;B[gf];W[fg];B[dm];W[gp];B[fm];W[gj]C[Good double attack! Now black must defend both the upper group and the lower group!]

(;W[cj]C[No need to defend here. Try reading the cut carefully and then check my variation. You should have let him taste his own medicine and slide under his stones at C6!]
;B[dk]
(;W[ej]C[No need to defend here either! Better would be first to connect your groups by G8 which black should answer with G7 and then either sliding under black or chasing him out. See variation]
;B[co];W[cp];B[do]
(;W[ep]C[You don't need to defend here! Black is still dead if he does not add a stone to left side! You should chase him out at K4 or something similar. See variation for killing( note: too early yet ! do not try this at home! )]
;B[qn]C[Darn! black got to strenghten his walls before you had the change to attack him. Now you should finish your lower side as the last gap on blacks side is not as important(remember R17). It is easy to finish it by K4(remember, black is still almost dead) and N3 after.]

Few pointers for the middle game:

- Try to see the direction of play, for example "If I play here, where will the enemy run and how will I benefit from that? Will he run into my territory(worst choice) or his territory(middle choice) or a neutral zone(best choice)?"
- Remember to attack from a distance and defend up close! It is a rare thing to see contact plays as attacking moves!
