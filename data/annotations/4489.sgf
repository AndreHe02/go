C[I am a true beginner - IGS 22k only because that is the entry level now. I have been playing for 2 months and  have studied quite a bit and practiced, but the learning curve is steep. Please comment as you see fit. My fuseki is weak and I constantly feel like I am being led around by the arm. I believe this game is my best so far, but I don't really know if the competition was tough.]

Mattias> It is good to try new things and gather experience.]
;W[qn]
(;B[mq]C[Mattias> Usually one plays the "mirror move" from the diagonal.
In this case that would be at O3. Sometimes a move at O4 can work
as well. Another possibility is to first play contact at R5 and then
playing O4 to keep the pressure on white. See variation.];W[qq]

(;B[qp]C[Was this appropriate or ignore and play for more influence?

genereate you the most points?];W[pg]C[These invasions intimidate me. I am not confident protecting forces

Mattias> Invasions are hard to manage. The key point is not to
ktry to kill your enemy stones if you are not sure if you can.
Think about what you can gain while chasing the enemy stones.]

play at P17 and stop the white stones. That also threatens a
capture of three stones at O14 at the next move.];W[kf];B[kd]

to play for. Soon you should try to invade at C17.];W[gp];B[ck]

I was about to play in this area. But first I'd play C17.];W[in]

the game tough for white.];B[fq];W[mn];B[no]C[my second touchpad error, meant to play N5, tried to get Hiro to undo, but language barrier made it impossible :(

C[Mattias> Try to look at the board for a couple of seconds before
you place your stone. Then you don't fall for the temptation to
answer the opponent. Placing Q9 don't secure so much
territory. White did not answer your previous move. 
Continue your threat with an invasion. A monkey-jump to E19 or
an 3-3 invasion at C17 would be very big now. You do not have
any larger moves to make than that.]

Mattias> Good play. You will soon be a lot better. I suggest that you
play on KGS instead of IGS. The ranking system is a bit odd on IGS
and it can be hard to find suitable opponents. At KGS there are a lot
of beginners from 30k to high dan players. 

The biggest flaw you (and all other beginners) make is that you
easilly follow your opponent. So, before you place your stone, you
take a quick look around the board and tries to see if another move
can generate you more points. Either as pure profit in territory or
if you can reduce somewhere. Later you can try to read if that
sequece will end in sente of gote for you. If you can follow this tips
I am sure that you will become a couple of stones stronger right away.

Good luck in the future!  :o)])
