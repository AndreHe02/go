C[panairjdde: I was black. I resigned at move #170. At the beginning of the match I lost the left side of the goban.

Then lets see.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[kq];W[qn];B[ql];W[jc]

(;B[ld]C[I don't think, that you have to react on k17....and if you do it is probably better to play n17 because m16 is very high and white could come under it easily.]

(;W[on];B[nl]C[The 'normal' one would be o4 or o3.];W[dj];B[gq]
C[panairjdde: I was not sure D7 was safe, so I decided for a softer approach

yes, d7 would only complicate the game.];W[dn];B[fo];W[cf];B[er]
TR[fo][gq]C[This three stones are too close for the beginning of the game...instead of e2 i think o4 is bigger.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[oq];B[op];W[pq];B[no];W[qj]C[is it really necessary to answer the stone at r10??
i would have taken the stone at o4 because he could make you a lot of trouble later in the game...]
;B[qh];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]TR[oc][pd]C[that is too open! to many possibillitis to cut for white.]

(;W[oj]C[how can the white player let this group there in the upper right  only stand there? thats youre chance to kill!]
;B[nh];W[qp];B[qo]C[r5 is not that good....there can white play q5]

(;W[nn];B[mo];W[po];B[oo];W[ro]C[now he did this....];B[mm]
;W[mi];B[mj]TR[oj][qj]C[panairjdde: here I played N10 instead of around M12 because I wanted to leave a small space to live for W right group. however it was hard to let W to go towards the center.



the idea is good but when i were you i would have tryed to cut the both stones comepletly with o11]
;W[li];B[ni]C[exactly!];W[mn];B[ln];W[lm];B[ll]
(;W[km];B[kl]C[istead of l8 you should play m4];W[jm];B[lp]
;W[ol];B[om];W[pl];B[pm];W[pn];B[pk];W[ok];B[pj]C[hm.....white should have played o7 now]

(;W[rl];B[pi];W[qm];B[nm];W[ke]C[l15 isn't small but i think white should have connected with r9.]
;B[kg]C[panairjdde: maybe ths was a mistake? should I have played L16, allowing W to try to live in M14 area, but fighting for the middle up?

i think l1 is ok bescause white should react with something arround k11 to protect the 2 stones at m/n 11. then you can still play l16 to cut l15....]
;W[jj];B[kj]C[now you should really play l16 i think];W[lf]
;B[lg];W[pb];B[nd];W[ki];B[jk];W[ji];B[qk];W[gc];B[hh]C[panairjdde: I wonder if I should have played higher, around F15, or even 3-3 invasion

white is already too strong there tp play f15..but the 3-3 invasion would work...]
;W[em];B[fm];W[fl];B[gl];W[rj];B[rk];W[rm]C[here white could have connected with t9...]
;B[sj];W[el];B[fn];W[gk];B[hl];W[gi];B[hj];W[hi];B[ii];W[hk]
;B[ij];W[ik];B[ih];W[il];B[nj]C[instead of o10 m10 would be safer to kill the white stones arround m11.]

;W[ng];B[og];W[nf];B[me];W[of];B[pf];W[nk];B[ml];W[pg];B[oh]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[cq];B[eg];W[eh];B[dg]C[panairjdde: I was unsure to play here #127, because it enters in W's territory, but then W cuts in F13.

with d13 you wantedt too much here you should have connected first...]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[ff];B[ch]C[panairjdde: another problematic move...]
;W[ei]C[i don't think it is possible for black to live at this smal area...why don't you play s18 all the time? it is very big...]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[bj];W[bk];B[aj];W[rb];B[rd];W[ma];B[lc];W[mc]
;B[nc];W[kb];B[if];W[he];B[ie];W[jd];B[eo]TR[fn][fo]C[play it NEVER....you gave your opponent sente why?]
;W[id];B[jg];W[nr];B[mq];W[or];B[ck];W[dk];B[cl];W[bl];B[bm]
C[panairjdde: decisive mistake.];W[cm];B[ah];W[jp]C[you are both real tenuki masters. why hadn't white killed the stones at b11.....]
;B[jo];W[iq];B[jq]C[i would have played j5....];W[ip];B[ho]
;W[hn];B[in]C[panairjdde: second big mistake...];W[im]C[panairjdde: ...and match lost.

white`s leading isn't that high...arround 5 points...i think it is not the right time for a resignation....and with b13 you can even bring the group arround b11 to live...the 3-3 point in the upper left is still open...there was much more to do for you....

I hope you will understand my review and I please you to forgive me my grammatical mistakes if i did some!
