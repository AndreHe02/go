Hello,

My comments will be marked V:];B[qp]C[OneTrue [10k\]: good luck]

(;W[eq]C[V:

So you are trying to learn how to use the 3-5 effectively?

The 3-5 move is first and foremost a move. Like all other moves, we are faced with deciding if the move is good or bad.

One way to decide if a move is good or not is to play out variations that start from the move and comparing them. If the variations are good for you, then you can say it's a good move, and if the variations are bad, then you can say the move is bad for you.

The drawback of this method is that it requires considerable reading skills and a very good memory.]

This trade is not good for White.

The basic principle states:

Corner first
Then sides
Then center

Start with the corners. Giving corners away is an easy way to lose games.

Right off the bat, Black has 15 points. 15 Free points (and it`s Black`s turn to play... this is ridiculous). Instead, give your opponent 15 points of komi and don't play like this.]

Why let him connect? All your previous moves indicate that a massive fight will develop, but you abandon the fight... Don`t try to play contradicting plays like this, it's inefficient.]

V:

B is better, A will allow Black to play at B and run away. You need to start thinking in this direction instead of the right (most of your next moves are on the right side. But it is clear that the left side of the board is more valuable.]

You were so busy concentrating on the right side of the board that you forgot what was happening on the left side.

Now Black`s position has nullified all your hopes of building a moyo in the center.

You must always look in both directions of your development. I`ve read a pro say something along the lines of "if you can`t look in both directions you might as well stop playing".]

V:

Nope, this should not have lived. I won't comment any further.

Mostly you lost the game because there is no global thinking behind your moves (grand objectives that you are achieving at the same time as local objectives).

Playing globally is really hard to understand. Before each move you play, look everywhere on the board and become aware of how the stones work together or don't work together. Eventually it will dawn on you what it means to play globally (but you will never understand it if you don't look everywhere on the board to justify your moves).]

How can you hope to win this game (against an opponent of equal skill that is).]

(;AW[dd]AB[cp]LB[oc:A][eq:B]C[V:

So, instead of reading out a ton of variations, let us simply imagine the board is like this and it's white's turn to play (this can be done in real time during the game itself and is a really powerfull skill to add to your arsenal).

If you are given the choice between A and B which one will you choose?

Both are 3-5 moves, but are they the same? Is one better than the other?

A is uncharted territory, B is well within Black`s sphere of influence. If I had to choose, I would pick A over B without questions. B seems like saying "I am so much better than you, that I will give you control of the game and still win".]

[pg:11][qh:12]C[V:

If we make this imaginary game progress in the same way the real game went, this is how it would look like (I`ve added moves 11 to 13 for closure).

It's still Black's turn, but at least you aren't overconcentrated and maybe you can use this influence to balance out the game.

Overall I think Black has a better position. In order to find positions in which your 3-5 move would lead to a better position for White, I would have to explore a ton of variations and I am to lazy for that :)]

TR[ic]C[V:

If you jump at move 18 of the real game, you will find this.

You`re position at the bottom is overconcentrated. You will barely get any territory and I don't think that influence is very usefull (because of the overconcentrated position)

It`s Black's turn to play, so he is in control of the game and he can continue along some master plan of his own. In the game, he played J17.]
