C[K- hi, thanks for sending this game in for review. I'll include my comments with a 'K' prefix as I have done here.

Overall, I agree with your comment on move 142: the game was lost when you let black into your big territory down the right side of the board. And as you commented on move 16, your approach to the bottom left corner didn't work in your favour, but this wasn't a huge problem for you.]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[dp];W[pq];B[jq];W[fp]LB[jg:E][dj:C][jm:D][dp:A]
[jq:B]C[K- ok, so let's examine this approach.

He has 2 stones, A and B, which you want to split apart before he can make them into territory right? But what is the best tactic for doing this?

Visualise a straight line between A and B. If you feel you have enough space to fight and make life between his stones, it is safe to play just below the line. And if you have some friendly stones not too far away that you can jump towards to connect (for example around the triangle of points C/D/E), then it is safe to play just above the line. Sometimes both may be true and you have both options. But here neither is true so you should play elsewhere. For example, you could play around C to create the circumstances when playing the high approach that you did in the actual game will work better.

You may hear the teams invasion and reduction in this type of situation, or keshi and uchikomi in japanese.]
;B[eq];W[hq]C[K- you know the saying, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger? here you are not going to kill any of these black stones so playing in this area will make them stronger. You would do better to take a big point elsewhere instead.]
;B[io];W[fn];B[mp];W[oo];B[ln];W[dn];B[bo];W[ck]TR[ln][io][mp]
[jq]C[VipassanaMan: I didn't feel like the sequence to here was good for me - a big corner for black and an alive second group, and nothing much for me.

K- I agree. The black group I've marked is not yet fully alive but in practice you won't be able to kill it (black would have to ignore several attacking moves, which he won't do). However you can take profit by putting it under pressure, making him respond while you build a good position on the right side and/or towards the middle from the left side.]
;B[ld];W[nc]LB[fc:B][cf:A][nm:C]C[K- you do not need to respond to his approach. You could approach the top left corner from either of the points I've marked - A works well with your group in the lower left, and B is an example of where you HAVE got enough space to split his stones and make life at the top.

Or you can play elsewhere entirely. The point marked C is tempting - gently leaning on the black group at the bottom while building up your position on the right side. 

Point C is a big point for both sides at this moment. You can see this by visualising how the board will look with a white stone here compared to having a black stone here.]
;B[he]C[VipassanaMan: Too high by black.

 K- yes. Black is showing that he wants to build a central position and concede the top side... but this strategy is flawed because he won't get as many points in the centre as he gives away along the side.]
;W[hc];B[fd];W[kc];B[kd];W[lc];B[lh]LB[dh:B][dj:A]TR[dd][fd]
[kd][ld][he]C[VipassanaMan: Too early to play towards the centre I thought?

K- generally when you have built a wall like the marked black stones, you should play at least one stone some distance away from it to start to use the strength of the wall. Black's stone shows the right idea but on too small a scale. It would be better to play around A for example. This would give a good amount of space between the stone and the wall, plus by being so close to white's stone it encourages white to respond locally, which will strengthen black's position too. By doing this, black could establish a position that dominates the whole centre of the board, which is consistent with the strategy of playing the H15 stone on move 19. It is even possible that by taking the initiative in this area he may be able to build up enough points to offset losing the top side?

However, since he hasn't done this, you should take advantage of his mistake by extending up the left side into the area he should have played in ... for example, at B.]
;W[ph];B[eh]C[VipassanaMan: And again, too high.

K- yes. He has the right idea but this stone is too close to the wall and too high from the edge.]
;W[ch];B[cf];W[di];B[ei];W[bm];B[gl];W[el];B[hm]
(;W[pk]LB[fj:B][lk:A]C[K- I think you need to be more aggressive with this move.

On the plus side, you are making the whole right side almost secure, so that's a lot of points, but playing a move that your opponent can ignore locally always carries the risk of "can he come up with a move that's just as good or better?"

For example, black's position has vulnerabilities at A and B. If you attack these, you can threaten to separate his stones into 2 groups, and the group at the bottom does not currently have space for 2 eyes without either descending to the edge (which gives you an extra move to strengthen your position in the centre) or responding to your moves in the centre, which allows you to continue building up strength in the centre too.

See variation for one simple example of how this might happen.]

LB[qe:C][pg:B][lh:D][oi:E][pi:A][pk:F]C[VipassanaMan: Too aggressive? I think i should have just played Q13 or Q11

K- yes, A would be best here. B would be less good because you have already reinforced that connection with your stone at C.

Black's stone at D provides "backup" for this stone you are attacking, so you will not gain much by this attacking move (even if he gives up this stone, he doesn't lose much territory).

However, if D was not there and you wanted to counter attack, consider a stone at E. Your stone at F protects the cutting point at A.]
;B[nh]C[K- good calm response by black];W[ng]LB[pg:B][pi:A]
C[K- black's last stone made his position stronger, but your move here is not helping you. You have cutting points at A and B which black can exploit. Since black played a calm strengthening move, you can do the same - for example play at A.]
;B[mg];W[nl]LB[pi:A][fj:B]TR[pk][oo]C[K- I would say A and B are your best options here. A is defensive (it strengthens the whole side, including the gap between your marked stones), B is attacking.]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[oj];W[pj];B[ok];W[ol];B[nr];W[qp]LB[fj:A]C[K- you didn't need to respond to black's move locally. Your best attacking move is probably still at A]

K- yes, well spotted, this extra move was not needed

Instead, there is an interesting push-and-cut at A followed by the cutting point at B... you could get some good points there.]

VipassanaMan: Looks to me like I lost the game in two places. My first corner approach went badly, and then right at the end I made a big reading mistake.

K- don't be too worried about the corner approach - at first it did not go so well for you but you turned it around and made lots of points in that area of the board in the end. Ultimately that's what wins games!

Hope you found my comments useful. I have enjoyed reviewing the game, thanks for sending it in. If you have any further queries, feel free to get back to me.]
