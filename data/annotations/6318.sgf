C[DV:

Hi, this game is played on KGS. I usually win 90% of my games against 1k. But still when I play 1d I usually lose. I am not sure why I lose though.

I assume I spot all my big mistakes after the game. But I am not really sure how I can learn anything from this game to play better next time. It looks like I got behind without realizing it.

So, all little advice, tricks and moves I missed are welcome. I would just like to learn SOMETHING from this game :).


Empiror: if you've got 90% winning rate at ur current rank, ur rank should be upgraded soon. to avoid making same mistake again, it's hard and that's how we improve.]

C[DV:
This often happens on KGS ...  As far as I know: C is the way how it is played in professional go. But most of my opponents seem to play B instead of C.

Emp: both are valid moves, the difference is their focus. C is strengthenning himself before going to R6. B is limiting b's extension at upper part of the board.]
;B[ph]C[DV: Usually I play like ...];W[qh];B[pj]LB[pg:B][pi:A]
C[DV: In pro games I've always seen A as response, but on KGS most players seem to play B instead. I'm not sure how to respond to it.

Emp: if w goes for B, b can just take A, very thick for b.]

(;W[pg];B[oh];W[qk]LB[pk:A][pl:B]C[DV: A seems like nice shape, but it gives so much away in terms of territory. So I try to avoid it. B  gives white a smaller base so that it is still not totally alive.]

(;B[pl]C[emp: very bad move, broken];W[og];B[nh]LB[oh:A][pk:B]
[pl:C]C[DV: This is kind of annoying though. Which makes me wonder if  A was correct.  Playing B instead of C would have made things easier too off course.]
;W[pk];B[ok];W[ng];B[mh];W[pb]C[DV: This is kind of annoying. I spend a lot of time to get this alive. And I feel like white missed a couple of oppuritinities to kill my group.

emp: try to forsee 'annoying' things and prepare for them at ease. no way b can't be eaten without mistakes.]

;B[mb];W[lb];B[lc];W[kc];B[rd];W[rc];B[nd]LB[ma:A]C[DV: here I wonder a bit why white didn't play A because it looks like sente to me.

(;W[me];B[la];W[ld];B[kb];W[jb];B[lc];W[jc];B[lb]C[DV: this cost me a lot of time, but all by al I think this game is still even here.

emp: because b's got P8 weakness, w got sente, it's not as even as it seems.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[oo]LB[oo:A][jq:B]C[DV: I would have played B instead of A.

emp: B is good, A is agreesive and not necessarily bad.];B[np]

(;W[mn];B[lo];W[ol];B[ln];W[nk];B[oj]
(;W[om]LB[jh:A]C[Here my plan is to play as many forcing moves as possible from the lower side to build influence first. I am neglecting N12 in this process so that I can play a central move in last-minute to reduce white influence.]

C[DV: This is to settle and because I concider M11 sente for white.]
;W[lk]
(;B[fp]C[DV: From this point I concider myself slightly ahead.

I played F4 high because ... see variation];W[dn];B[co]LB[do:A]
[dq:C]C[I guess this is a big mistake from my side. I should have played C.

I blindly expected he would play A. Which is off course wrong.

emp: 73 is incoherent with 71...];W[cp];B[iq]LB[fn:A][hq:B]
C[LV: I concidered A instead but there is too much aji around B if I play like that.]
;W[jm]C[DV: The stratigic value of these 2 stones is starting to get smaller. And capturing them would be gote for white anyway.
So I can neglect this move.];B[jf]LB[jf:B][hh:A]C[DV: This group is not 100 procent alive yet. And a white move at A would result in huge influence for white. So I decided to reinforce my group. Playing A myself seems would reduce more of white his influence but my group wouldn't really become stronger, there would remain a lot of forcing moves.]
;W[ie]
(;B[cf]LB[cc:A][cf:B]C[mDV: I concidered A instead of B. Because there are a lot of points in the corner. If I would end up in sente that would be manageable. But my guess is that I would not have ended up with sente ... (see variation)]
;W[hg]LB[cc:A][cf:C][mh:B][cl:D]TR[ci]C[DV: I just do not have to review my B-group yet. I can wait a bit more.

Playing A would hurt my C stone. So before I move in ... I first play a solid 2 point extension. after that it will be easier to play D and it will be easier to invade at A.

The fact that my extension is on 2nd line bothers me a bit . Cause that will mean that white will play many forcing moves to push me down on 2nd line later, and he will have the chance to use his influence after all. But playing on 3th line instead of 2nd line would not be safe enough for me. Therefor I play on 2nd line anyway.]
;B[ci];W[ii]LB[je:E][if:B][ih:C][ji:D][nj:A]C[now I need to defend my group. :)

I see B,C,D and E are 4 forcing moves I concidered

I also concider A. In my opinion A is an important keypoint.

emp: usually, it's of high priority to have a way out. to do L&D inside  is a torture... ur 'forcing moves' are gifts to ur opponents in a situation like this, try to avoid them as possible as you can.]
;B[ih];W[hh];B[ji]LB[hh:2][ih:1][ji:3][ki:A]C[I played these 3 moves first because it avoids an annoying move of white on A which would destroy my eyespace.

emp: w is too happy to play along ...  these moves of b are the reason it's getting very hard for b later on. try to realize the pain before u suffer from it.]
;W[ij];B[nj]C[DV: This move seems necessary to me.];W[jp]LB[kq:A]
C[DV: I did not see this move coming.

And I was not sure how to deal with it.

Maybe I should have played A ?

(;W[cd]C[I am a bit surprised here that white is not interested in pushing through.

emp: w has K8 weakness.];B[cl]C[I first play this move to secure my group a bit more.

emp: good move, considering w's overwhelming wall at the centre , b has to be worried about safty.]
;W[cn];B[jl]LB[jl:B][mp:A]C[I concidered A, but B is sente for both.]

(;B[mp];W[ik];B[kn];W[gn]LB[ef:B][ei:A]C[in my opinion this move is a bit slack of white.

I concidered both A and B. But B looks more forcing.

[cg:2][eh:3]C[DV: At first sight I thought I could capture this stone with a keima.

emp: be aware w's wall... b is fighting in a dangerous place.
 it's all because b's N12 group got shut inside and b has to do a lot 'wall building' for w...]
;B[df];W[cg];B[eh];W[bf];B[be];W[bg]LB[ce:A]C[I was planning to play A here but suddenly noticed I made a mistake. (see variation)]

thickness (especially thickness around the centre) changes balance in other battlefields far away. this game is a war in which every battle is related even they seem far away from each other.
