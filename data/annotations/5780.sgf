C[I was very pleased with my play in the first half of the game, so I will leave comments in this half to the pro. I'll point out my own mistakes in the second half, with questions.


---------

Pro? Hardly. But thanks for the flattery. I tend to write a lot when I make a comments. I'm going to try to curb that a bit here, but if you're confused feel free to email me questions.

When I comment on the same move you wrote something, I'll put my comments below a dashed line like I did here.]
;B[pd]C[I do have a few things to point out in the earlier part of the game, but I'll keep those comments to a relative minimum as they have more to do with my play style than any overt mistakes.]

(;W[qe]LB[qf:A]C[Close. Standard approach is at A. Playing there allows more flexibility (learning the joseki that follow is pretty easy, and most players seem to know them).]
;B[qd];W[qg]LB[rc:A]C[While this move seems kinda weak to me in this situation. However, the two-space extension probably will invite a clamp.]
;B[re];W[rf]LB[pe:A]C[This is fine, but I'd be afraid of him turning at A. This move would keep sente and he could still play at T16 on his next turn. It also helps build strength to the outside.]

C[This is a great move for the endgame, but not so good right now (I know you didn't make it, but I still feel it's worth pointing out).

While it IS sente, I'm not sure you would have protected there sooner than he would have played there. I think it would be better to build a framework in the lower part of the board OR invade the left side.]

[nl][hm][im][mm][mn][nn]C[By coincidence, I realized at this point that I could capture the marked unit. So I got anxious and played for it, without responding to his move in the top-left.

-----

Correct. Connecting is the right choice. He can't live under there afterward, but he has plenty of ko-threats.]

(;W[ik];B[cd]LB[db:E][dc:A][ec:D][nm:B][qm:C]C[At this point, I made my second mistake: I could have at least cut my loss in the top-left corner and played at A. Instead, I played far too hastily and assumed he would play at B or at the very least C... It is quite obvious that I had nothing to gain by playing C, and everything to lose by not playing A.

--------

He has to play at C first. B just lets you kill more stones. For saving what you can, follow the variations.

You need two of A, D, and E to provide life to some of your remaining stones. To save all of them, you need A.]

(;W[qm];B[rm];W[nm];B[dc]LB[db:B][ec:A]C[My first question is, was it possible to save anything in the contested corner now, or did I wait too long before responding? Obviously my attempt to save it failed...

-------

It's too late. If you read the variation earlier, you can see that Black just played on one of the miai points mentioned in the earlier diagram. If you attempt to play at A to secure one eye, Black plays at B and shuts the other eye before it forms.]

-------

These are annoying. The there is an art to giving your opponent enough rope to hang himself. luckily for you, he connected on the outside. Inside, it can be a race into the corner.

I try to squeeze without touching. Calmy play into his eyespace and make him squirm. Just be sure to avoid putting your own groups in danger.]
;W[bo];B[dp];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[bn]C[You've done fine up to this point. Black's double-hane in this situation is risky. I think it's kind of a cheap trick. If you've done some joseki study, this move will register in your mind as part of the 3-3 invasion. It's not.]

(;W[dm]LB[dn:A]C[This move confused me. It seems to me that it came from a fear of 1. cutting due to the joseki response and 2. fear that had black played at A, he'd have a shot at eyes.

Either way, it looks confused to me. When Black shows a weakness deep in your territory, attack. Severely.]
;B[dn]TR[bn][co][dp]C[I've had this happen before, where a stronger player tries to trip up a beginner by playing these diamond shapes. How can you stop this?

-------

Play on his pivots (pivot = one of the three points he needs to make a tigers' mouth). If you'd played here the move beforehand, it would have stopped him cold.

The marked shape is called the Lion's Mouth (or trumpet connection). It's extremely strong despite leaving two peeps. He protects both cutting points at once.

The trick to defeating it here now that it's formed is using the peeps to your advantage. Remember he needs two eyes to live. You can let one form if you can prevent the other.]
;W[en];B[eo]C[What follows is a typical example of over extended shape. You're trying very hard to kill/capture those stones. As such, you leave behind a lot of weakness.

It is, however, still possible to kill his group. D5 is NOT an eye. His best chances are at C6 and B7. So, shut one or both.]

(;W[ep];B[fo];W[fn]LB[eq:A]TR[cm]C[This was a weak move, I could have instead played at A to force him to connect, and seriously damaged (probably killed) his invasion attempt...

---------

D5 is false anyway. He can play at the marked point to make life.]

C[It's obvious to me upon review that A is the better move, but I was so far into unplayed territory by this point that I didn't know what I was doing.


----------

Yes. Stay alert for double-atari potential. The real problem is that the aji at the triangled point is becoming very large.]
;B[dl];W[ck];B[em];W[fm]LB[fj:A]C[Small potatoes. A also reverse sente and MANY times larger than F7.]
;B[ek]LB[fj:A]C[He lets you off easy. Had he played A instead, he would have gotten the group outright. You still have the chance to save the group (see next move).]
;W[dk]LB[ej:A]C[You need to play at A now or suffer dire consequences.]
;B[ej]LB[fj:A]C[Goodnight. You can't save them all. You should have connected that which you could save by playing at A.]
;W[ei];B[fj]C[I resigned in frustration here, since it was quite obvious I had lost my initial enormous lead. Was it possible to reverse the outcome at this point?

---------

No. Sadly this game has become a lost cause and you were right to resign.

Winning won games is its own art. One thing that helps greatly is to practice positional judgment. When you're ahead, taking away your opponent's chances of winning something back from you is just as effective as pressing your attack. 

The first 'invasion' was merely a case of greed overriding common-sense. When your opponent plays underneath your stones, ALWAYS ask yourself, "What does he see? What is he trying to do?" Many kyu players (especially on the internet where the games are invariably more informal) play a lot of speculative moves. I've been slowly weaning myself off of them and try to read them out before playing something.

The second invasion was a matter of touch. When your opponent invades, try to figure out where his eye space is and then get there before he does. You don't have to capture in order to kill. You just have to make sure he doesn't have two eyes or can run to a live group.]
)
(;W[cm]LB[em:A]C[This peep really puts and end to the invasion. Black MUST eventually play at C6, meaning it can't be an eye. The peep means that he can't get much out of cutting at A, because if he lets you play C6, it's all over.]
;B[cn]TR[fq]C[There's no way D5 can become an eye. The marked stone forms the 'eye-stealing tesuji', falsifying D5 (kinda nuanced, but you should be able to see it. Eventually, Black will have to connect at D5, since those stones are cut off from the rest of the group otherwise).]
))
(;W[cn]C[Cut! The double-hane is super urgent. Cross-cutting is the way to go.]
;B[do]C[Black must play here. If you capture, it's over outright.]
;W[bm]LB[fj:B][bp:A]SQ[dk][ek][cl][dl][el][cm][dm][em][dn]C[Capturing this stone ends the invasion. Black's now trapped between two of your strong positions. He'll have a really hard time making life out of this shape.

Black has two options here. Cut at A and to try to make two eyes somewhere in the marked area. Neither will go well. There is some aji at B, but it alone can't really get black enough room to work.]

(;B[er];W[br]C[Not a chance.])
(;B[br]C[Looks promising, but Black needs two moves consecutively to make lfe in that corner. So, can he capture your shape on the outside?

Yes, if you don't connect. Since he needs two moves to live underneath, you have time to connect out. Otherwise, he will catch your group.]

(;W[qk]C[Or possibly even wider depending on how much you like to fight. The problem with the move you chose is that while it may have looked to you like you were destroying his territory, What stood out to me is that you gave up two corners.

You need to make some territory here in order to get real compensation for the strength he gets on either side of this group.]

(;W[pk]LB[je:A][jq:B]C[I think this is an interesting move. I'd look at playing at A which threatens invasion. I'd try to use the threat to build influence facing the center and quickly convert it into territory by running the side group out along the bottom.

Alternately, when Black repsponds, you can take the large point at B. This extension aims more at giving your group flexibility than immediately settling.]

(;W[qf]LB[qc:B][nd:A][qh:C][qi:D]C[Black can respond a number of ways.

A: standard Joseki. Possibly a little overconcentrated here due to the stone on the upper side.

B: Skip right to taking the corner. Runs a risk of a nasty invasion on the upper side. But might not be that bad for Black

C or D: Pincer. Works well with the enclosure on the lower side. I like D or even R10 better than C, as C invites white to invade the upper side in retaliation (White can still invade the pincer-extension as well, yum).

I'll provide the joseki that follows Black's play at C, but I'm not sure that joseki is the best answer for White here.]
