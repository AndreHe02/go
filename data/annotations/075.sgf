;W[cc];B[pp]C[I like this move! It stresses the power of the black hoshi
stones while pushing down the white stone.];W[qp];B[po];W[pq];B[qo];W[nq]
;B[pj]L[pl]C[The situation on the right looks like the normal joseki with
the difference that white's corner is smaller. I am not sure about
black q10 though. It leaves white with an invasion at [a\].];W[cn];B[fq]
L[cl][cq][cp]C[Can't be bad, though I would play at [a\], to invite white
to play more moves on the lower edge after he invades with [b\],
B[c\], et cetera...];W[nc];B[nd]L[kd][lc]C[Personally, I don't like tsuke-nobi. It builds up power, but
at the price of strengthening the opponent. I would have played pincer
with either [a\] or [b\], but it's stricktly personal opinion.];W[md];B
[ne];W[qc];B[oc]C[Good move, the only way to use the local stones efficiently.
It will hurt the right side position though. But that's Go: give
and  take :-)];W[qd];B[mc];W[qf]C[And black has sente, also useful of course, and has to be
taken into consideration while choosing the joseki in the upper-right.]
;B[cl]L[np][mp][mo][pl][qh]C[In this position a leasury move would be at [a\] (white
[b\], black [c\]). It protects against the white invasion at [d\],
sets up the large follow up at [e\] and is in tune with black's thickness  overall. The move actually played is more aggressive, and definitely  not bad. Maybe it's even better, a matter of taste.]
;W[cp]C[San-san might be more normal in this position.];B[cq];W[bq];B[bp]
C[Quite a decision by black!];W[co];B[br];W[dq];B[cr];W[bo]L[aq]C[Bad since it's aji keshi (spoiling the future possibility
of white [a\]. Besides, it's bad shape.];B[aq];W[ep];B[do];W[eq]C[Overplay, the black stone at f3 is light (easy to sacrifice),
but the white stones at e3 or c5 aren't. So white has two weak groups,
while black has none.];B[eo];W[fp];B[dm]C[Good combination, white lost considerably and still needs
to play at the lower side.];W[gq];B[el]C[Good! A honte move, finishing the shape locally, to remove
future annoyance. A thick move.];W[fo];B[dd]L[np]C[Now, a move around [a\] would have double value, building up own position, while reducing the opponents position.]
;W[dc];B[cd]L[ed]C[No, too much aimed at the left side, while ignoring the overall position of black's stones. The only move is at [a\].]
;W[bd]L[ed][ee][fe]C[I would play [a\], [b\], [c\] when I'd play white.]
;B[be];W[bc];B[ed]C[Good, increasing the liberties of black's stones.];W
[fc];B[fd]C[Humm, I'm not sure about this move. Too difficult to give an oppinion without studying the position thoroughly.]
;W[gc];B[mo]L[hc][gd]C[But, pushing once, and then play elsewhere is *not* good. The push strengthens white considerably (the weakness at [a\] is gone for example). The only move is keep on pushing with [b\]. Of course, the move played is also very valuable.]
;W[fn]L[fm][fl]C[I would play the kikashi at [a\] instead. It will have a follow up with [b\] later on.]
;B[en]L[em]C[Maybe better to play bamboo (black [a\]). It'll help more to invade the lower side, while taking a liberty with e6 is not useful in this position probably.]
;W[dh]L[bf]C[Entering the messy stage :-). Maybe I would have started with [a\] myself to check on black's response first.]
;B[cf]C[A confident move! Building up strength to enable a later attack.]
;W[fh];B[hh];W[fj];B[hj];W[fl]C[This would have been impossible when black would have played e6 at e7, but that's slightly coincidental. However, since white can play this move, maybe the previous move of black should be reconsidered.]
;B[fm];W[gm];B[fk];W[em];B[dn];W[ek];B[gk];W[dl];B[dk];W[cm]C[Humm, I guess this is the mistake you mentioned earlier :-). Terrible! Didn't you feel to resign here Jim? :-)]
