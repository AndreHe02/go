C[Sean Madigan - White  Greg L - Black

I am white in this game.  Any  comments you have would be  greatly appreciated.  Especially  comments on my choice of moves  with regard to whole board positions  and the continuity of my stones.
However, please feel free to  comment on what you think my  weakest points are as a player.

zbuh: Hi. I think you both played a good game and usually chose very reasonable moves. However, White was a bit too impatient in the opening and went into difficulties early in the game. Don't forget that the komi compensates for Black's advantage in the beginning, so White must refrain from playing too aggressively, or he'll make weak groups.
In other words, you left weaknesses behind you because you wanted to be ahead everywhere. The game becomes unmanageable when you do that too much. If you take time to build strong groups, they become a very profitable asset as you move into the middle game, while if you leave weaknesses they give your opponent opportunities to play dual purpose moves. Of course, it's difficult to find a good balance between thickness and extension, and it's also a matter of personal style, but I think you could benefit from more attention to your thickness.]

;B[pj]C[zbuh: The fuseki looks ok to me so far.];W[nq]C[Correct timing for invasion?  Should I  have played around c9 or c10?
Also, is this the proper place to  invade?  Should I have invaded at  san san?

zbuh: I think this is prematurate. You'll probably have to invade the south-east quarter at some point, but Black can't cancel this opportunity in one move and you still have big open points to take, which is much better than creating a weak group. c9 (rather than c10 as it makes better continuity with your stones below) or d8 are probably ok. c14 or d14, k16 are other possibilities.
As regards the point you chose for your invasion, I think it's good.  Invading at san san now would allow Black to get a strong outside which would work extremely well with his other stones, while with this move you'll probably get to separate Black into two groups. I don't know which of o3 and r6 is preferrable.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[kq]C[This extension was very short.   Blacks next move made his left  group very strong.  My  intent was to live, but I now feel I  should have jumped to o6.

zbuh: I think this isn't such a bad move as you think. It'll allow you to stabilize your invading group. Of course Black gets something in exchange, but you can't have everything especially when you invade your opponent's area of influence. I don't think o6 would be a good choice because Black would get to make an extension at m3 and make your group eyeless at the same time. But the placement of your stone is not very good: m3 or maybe l2 are better choices.]
;B[jq];W[jd]C[zbuh: This is a big mistake. In general, you mustn't leave an exchange like l3, k3 as is. If you think you can't afford to be gote, at least don't play l3 first because Black gains more aggressive power against your stones in this exchange than you improve your defense. k16 is a good point but now that you chose to invade, it is more urgent to take care of your stones.
I think a more correct move here would have been k2 or l4 or l2. Neither seems to lead to a very pleasant result for White, but the idea is that you must patiently defend your stones.]
;B[cf]C[zbuh: I prefer Black c11 because it makes c8 and c14 miai.]
;W[ci]C[Was this pincer correct?  My stones  in bottom left were weak.  Also,  should I have pincered on fourth line  to emphasize attack?

zbuh: A pincer is a possible choice but I prefer c12 which is more severe against the Black stone, while c11 doesn't work especially better with the b4 and c6 stones. f16 or f17 are also good. Your stones at b4 and c6 are not really weak as long as Black doesn't take c3. I'd play the pincer on the third line, but this is only my style. An advantage of the fourth line is that it limits Black's strong influence.]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[bd];W[dk]C[zbuh: When you pincer, you usually can't play on both sides of the pincered group and the stone pincering from outside should be regarded as light. Although d9 is very attractive, I think c17 was a more consistant and better choice, as it keeps pressure on the black stones and increases your potential for territory at the top.]
;B[hd];W[he]C[Is this next sequence a good choice  for white?

zbuh: I don't think so. A few moves later, you do connect your stones but at the expense of a ponnuki for Black. This should be avoided if possible. g15 was better in my opinion, as it separates Black's stones and moves White's into the centre.]
;B[ie];W[id]C[zbuh: I prefer g15. Then if Black c17, White j16; if Black j16, White c17 and Black has two groups under pressure.]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[hf];W[hc]C[zbuh: With this result, White's pincer isn't a success. The wholeboard position favors Black: he is thick, he has much influence, and good potential of territory on the right side. White has some territory on the left and the top but he's rather thin. Three corners are still unsettled. And, of course, White has a big problem with his weak group in the bottom right, all the more so as all friend stones are very far.]
;B[kp];W[lq]C[zbuh: In the moves that follow, you did well despite a difficult situation.]
;B[nn];W[oo];B[on]C[zbuh: I prefer q4.];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[op]
C[zbuh: Bad for Black.];W[no];B[ro];W[or];B[qq];W[pr];B[mo]
;W[lp];B[lo]C[zbuh: You're narrowly alive (it seems) so that Black must play in gote to shut you in, which is a good result. But Black has excellent yose in that region and, of course, he did shut you in so that he is now dangerous in the centre.

I think the hottest point now is p14. A move in the upper left corner is big but it's sort of gote-gote. A move in the upper right corner is probably not big enough now. Then there is the lower left corner which is senteish for you and gote for Black. I think the position is more balanced now but you need to be careful with the centre.]
;W[cr]C[zbuh: You can afford a move in this corner only if you retain sente. You don't want Black to play p14 before you. As Black I would hesitate to reply to your move, but maybe I would.]
;B[dr];W[cq]C[zbuh: This is certainly not affordable. Black should tenuki and take p14 or around.]
;B[dq];W[je]C[Was this move to slow?  I wanted a  dual purpose move- to protect and  expand my upper territory, and  reduce black in center (since by this  point I have very little outward  influence).

zbuh: You're looking at the right region of the board, but this move has a few flaws. The gap between yours stones in the upper right corner and the others further to the left is still there (although it is better defended), so it doesn't accomplish very well your first purpose; it's true that you limit Black's strength in the centre but, as you wrote, the move is a bit slow in this regard; also, it isn't a good idea to play a contact move against a strong formation like a ponnuki: if Black accepts the exchange and plays k14, he gets stronger while White's advantage is not very clear.
Here's an advice that helped me a lot: don't play dual purpose moves which are only so-so moves. A real dual purpose move is the best for both its purposes. They're precious but rare. In most other cases, it's better to stick with single purpose moves that clearly do their job.
I consider that p14 is still the key point.];B[jf];W[he]C[zbuh: I disapprove of this atari. Black is happy to connect at j14 (because after that, for example, Black l13 would be more forceful against White l14) . Maybe you wanted to make your stones safer after Black k14, but there's still a ko after Black connects, so you improved their safety only by one ko step, which is not enough compensation in my opinion.]
;B[if];W[qh]C[zbuh: This stone is very weak: it is pincered as soon as you play it and Black has powerful backup with his wall further down. The cutting stone at r6 is a threat, but I don't think it's very dangerous because Black can play r2 in sente. Black's established territory is not very large yet, while White is better in this regard, so you should keep your cool and play a calmer move.]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[pg];W[rf];B[qe];W[qj];B[qk];W[rj];B[qi]C[zbuh: Bad for Black.]
;W[ri];B[pi];W[re];B[oe];W[fn]C[Was it more urgent to play r16?  I  played f6 to try to gain some control  in the center- since it seemed a very  important part of the game right now.

zbuh: As a consequence of your stone at r12, you're in a very unpleasant position now. Both r16 and the centre are critical. r16 is very big and it allows you to completely settle the position in the corner, so I think it was better to play there, and then struggle against Black in the centre.]
;B[ho];W[rk]C[Should I have continued in the  center.  Somewhere around g9?

zbuh: It's difficult for me to say. Your move is embarrassing for Black. If you choose to reduce the centre, g9 is a good point. r16 is still very important. As White, I'd have played there, and as Black, I'd now play r2 sente then r16: Black shouldn't want absolutely to preserve a big centre or he'll surrender to all your moves; he should rather use the weaknesses that you left behind because of the threat that he make a big centre.]
;B[ql];W[jl]C[zbuh: Too deep. Here's a rule of thumb for such situations: draw a line between the stones that limit Black's potential territory, let's say h5 and h14, and don't play beyond.]
;B[hl]C[This move was bad.  Especially  since I just left it there after this.

zbuh: You mean White's move, I presume. Black's reply is terrible for White.]
;W[rm];B[qr];W[fe]C[zbuh: Black gets at least a ko when he plays n2.]
;B[gf];W[ff];B[fg]C[zbuh: This move doesn't connect Black, and doesn't separate weak White groups: it's pointless.]
;W[eg];B[dg];W[eh];B[cb];W[db];B[dc];W[ec];B[cc];W[da]C[zbuh: Very little move. Locally, it's better to play e18.]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[ce];W[fh];B[gh];W[gg]C[zbuh: f13 is still a noncritical stone. g11 or l14 were better moves. Of course, there are still r16 and n2.]
;B[hh];W[cd];B[ca];W[eb];B[el];W[dl]C[I should have played e6 right?

zbuh: Locally, I prefer d7. Globally, r16 and n2.];B[em];W[en]
C[zbuh:];B[dm];W[cm];B[dn]C[Now I have lost, correct?

zbuh: Yes, Black's centre is too big and you can't defend both r16 and n2.]
