AB[dd][pp][dp]PL[W];W[pd];B[gq];W[cf];B[cc]LB[fd:a]C[This move is too defensive.  The objective of a handicap game is to use the extra stones to attack white.  'a' is the standard reply.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[iq];B[on]TR[on][qn][pp]C[The three marked stones form a triange, a shape used mostly for defense.  Black is strong here, so again there isn't any need to defend.  White overextended in his last move.  Black can take advantage of white's mistake and make some profit here.  See variation.]

(;W[pr];B[qq];W[mo]C[Now white has reinforcement and it makes it difficult for black to split white into two groups.]

;B[kn]LB[im:a]C['a' is better.  It puts more pressure on the left white group.]
;W[mm];B[kl];W[mk];B[cm]LB[dn:a]C['a' is better.  The game move is on the third line without much pressure on the left white group.  Besides, the two point extension is too far given there are four white stones nearby.]

;W[dr];B[cr];W[er];B[cq];W[br];B[cs]LB[dm:a]C[It's still not too late to connect at 'a'.  Black gets thickness on the outside as compensation.]

;B[qc]C[Black should take advantage of white's overplay.  See variation.]

(;W[pc]LB[jd:a]C[White blocks on the wrong side because he doesn't have a stone around 'a'.  So his wall will be useless.]
;B[qd];W[pe];B[qe]LB[rf:a][og:b]C['a' is the joseki move and the white plays 'b'.]
;W[ql]TR[qh][ql]LB[qj:a][ol:b][ph:c]C[White aims to connect his two marked stones.  Play 'a' to separate them.  If white plays 'b', black plays 'c'.  Black's lower right group is safe, so playing 'b' by white is not threatening.]
;B[ol];W[pk];B[ok];W[qj];B[nj]LB[pl:a][qk:b][pi:c]C[Play 'a' to force 'b', then play 'c' to force white inside.  Don't worry about the cut right now because white has to live first.]

[lc:c]C[White forms a wall with his three marked stones.  If black plays 'a' instead, his wall will become useless.  The game move forces white to play around 'b' or 'c', allowing white to make some territory.]
;W[pf];B[nh];W[me];B[li]LB[ef:a][ei:b][dh:c][di:d][bg:e]C[The two left white stones look isolated and black has a strong wall in the middle (horizontally).  Black can play the 'a' to 'e' sequence to make some profit.]
