C[Hi! I'm Lerion and I played as white in this game and lost by 2,5. This game was played in real life but I added our IGS ranks just for reference. I also play on KGS and I'm 5k.

Hi. I'm AleM and we both are requesting a review for this game. My comments will start with "A:" and his will be marked with "L:".

L: I commented some of my moves and I'd like to know if my judgment was correct. I'd also appreciate any advice about the game in any other stage or if I should have played elsewhere.
I also think my endgame was not so satisfactory as I was pressed most of the time.
Well, any criticism or suggestion is welcome =). Thank you for the review.



Thanks for a chance to review this game - i really enjoyed doing it. I've put my thoughts and some variations into the file - I hope they are useful to you. I don't think they're the definitive answers, but hopefully they will give you some more ideas about how you could have played differently. Overall, i thought both sides played very well. There were a couple of spots where white allows black to get what i would call a 'split shape' - one connected black group splitting two white groups. This is generally pretty good for black, so is worth thinking about. Other than that, I don't have any general comments. Let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers

(;B[fd]C[I'm not sure I like this choice of Joseki for black. Again, i'm not strong enough to call your move a real mistake, but I wouldn't like to play this way. My reasoning is: this variation builds strength facing the middle/down the left hand side. Because of the solid white group on the left, I think i would play differently.]

(;B[qg]C[A: Attacking from the upper side, like O17, would be a better move?

on the left, D10 looks very tempting, but if you want to take the initiative elsewhere, then i think perhaps the most important thing is to defend the 4 stones on top. The way you play, lets you do so quite naturally, so it looks pretty good. Alternatively, i would just play L16/17]

;W[ie];B[id];W[jg]C[Cutting at D10, would lead to a fight, but preventing the escape of the black stones on the left indirectly makes the middle white stones stronger. The D10 position looks very strange to my eyes.]

(;W[ho];B[hq];W[gm];B[jm]C[A: Too deep? Extending the territory in the right side (O6) could be better?

Any where on the line netween L11 and H5 is probably playable, say J7 or K9. 

Another option might be to play M10 to build up the right in exchange for the middle.]

(;W[jo]LB[mm:A][jo:B]C[L: Is this the right direction, or should I have tried to secure territory or even tenuki?

i's going to be tough to capture the black stone becuase it has two escape routes - down and  to the right. Black has more potential territory on the right, so perhaps it would be better to try to attack this stone from the other side, in order to reduce black's territory on the right?

I guess i would think of moves around A and B as miai in defending the black stone- white can get one, and then black will take the other. The area around A is more useful for Black to take territory, so i think it's more valuable for white to take that area than B, which will end up as neutral points for either colour.]
;B[lm]
(;W[nm]C[L: Black's territory on the right seems very prospective, so I thought I need to invade somehow. And was also an attempt to keep B stones disconnected.

Good idea, but it's perhaps a move too late, and a bit too deep.]
;B[nn];W[kn];B[km]
(;W[nj]C[L: As black was strong I was trying to play lightly.

Good idea, perhaps this is a bit too deep too.];B[mj]C[A: I don't know if I this is correct. I played this way because I thought I was behind in territory and this was the only way to win the game...]
;W[mi];B[ni];W[lk];B[mk];W[ml]C[L: Not so sure about the sequence from here on.

It's tough to see a good way out. I think the deep invasions are obviously the root of this fight, and that they probably needed to be shallower.]

(;W[ro];B[sl]C[L: As I realized I'd lose the semeai, I thought I should at least secure territory in sente, but later I noticed that this position had the ko threats I needed to win the game.

Yes the right thing to do is to go and play elsewhere. Black may always miss a loss of liberties on the middle stones, andthen you can come back and rip him off.]
;W[rn];B[qm];W[sn];B[sm];W[pp];B[sj];W[oo];B[sk]C[A: Unnecessary?

yup];W[lq]C[L: I don't think that was a good choice, but I'm not really sure how to proceed. Should I start on B3  or any other position?

This is big, B3 is big, and there's a big spot somewhere about S15. I think i would play the top right, but actually B3 is probably the biggest, because it has a bigger followup move.]

well you could always let the white stone connect through, more defensively, but i think white played pretty well to force a ko. I think perhaps you could have prevented it, but i'm not sure..]
