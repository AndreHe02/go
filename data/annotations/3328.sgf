C[A few mistakes and not a clear view of the board in terms of when to play where. A clear loss but quite unnecessary though. Please advice !!

Many thanks,
Lothar.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[iq];B[kq]
C[Wasn't sure what to play here.

I'm ok with this.
left B group will stabilize immediately with C3 later.];W[io]
;B[hp]C[This seem too early to me.
Besides, the shape (2 keimas) is not ideal.

Better play C3];W[ip];B[cq]C[OK];W[ck];B[mp]C[good];W[gq];B[gp]
TR[hp]MA[cp][fp]C[Not good.

1) you are defending a kikashi : the marked stone has done ts work. You can abandon it.

2) you are lucky because W was easy on you. See the variation next move

Better play at F4 or C4]
(;W[hq]
(;B[fo]C[I don't like this.

You will offer W an easy move at E4 or E3, and then your shape will be ugly.

A firm connection at F4 is probably better];W[eq];B[fr];W[er]
;B[es];W[dq];B[br];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[gn]MA[fm]C[too small. This stone accomplishes few.

If you want to play in this part of the board, F7 is better.

However, there are more important areas now : your group is alive "as is", so you can put the pressure on J3.]
;W[im];B[hn]MA[ed][jd][pj]C[same comment : though a forcing move, you have more impotant areas to focus on]
;W[in]C[Seemed to work out well ?

Agreed, apart from the two last moves.];B[gl]C[Looks slow now.

... ahem ...];W[qn];B[po]TR[mp]C[R4 better ?

yes, R4 is the only move (to me).
You are letting the corner open. This will be very costly, because Q5 does nothing :

- no territorry
- no real influence because it is redundant with N4];W[rp]C[this is the sanction]
;B[qj]C[ok];W[qr];B[qq];W[rq];B[pr];W[rr];B[qo]MA[ed][ik]C[same as H6 : you are playing kikashis where you should play bigger part of the board.]
;W[ro];B[pn]C[very same comment, but even worse :
This is called a "thank you" move for W
 - You cannot get anything from a potential cut at S6
- you force W to reinforce. W is very grateful.];W[qm];B[pm]
MA[ed][ik][mm]C[same (sight)];W[fc]C[W is very grateful ...]
;B[pg];W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[Q17 better ?

The difference is not large.
Anyway, at this stage, W will be ahead because B did not take the big points earlier]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[probably the wrong side];W[qd]
(;B[pe]TR[pg]C[no, see the variations.

This is played when there is nothing around, because of the cut at Q15.
However, with Q13, you can hane.];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]
;B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[rg];B[qg];W[rf];B[rh];W[jc]C[now W is satisfied, because B wall acomplished little]
;B[md]MA[le]C[M15 better];W[kb]
(;B[lb]C[H17 better ?

I'm not sure. A B stone there will be chased.
Better use G8 to pervase];W[hd]
(;B[je]MA[fj][gq][hq][im][in][io][ip][iq]C[this is not the proper time.

What are the biggest / hottest part of the board ?

1) obviously, the bottom W group is ultra thick, and therefore ultra weak : no base, no remote support, no shape. attacking it is an ABSOLUTE must.

2) the upper left side, where W will moyo with F10 or something equivalent]
;W[lq];B[lp]C[.];W[kr];B[lr];W[jq];B[mq];W[jr];B[is]MA[ik]C[no, attack from the upper side with J9.
Doing this, you will force W to get out and damage your potential upper centre]
;W[kp];B[lq]C[mistake L5 much better.

yes. you help W];W[ko];B[ln];W[kl];B[kn];W[jm];B[ik]C[ok];W[jk]
;B[il];W[ji]TR[jk][jm][kl]C[Remember this shape : it has a weakness (see var next stone).]

(;B[ij];W[jj];B[jl]C[too late :-(];W[km];B[kk]C[big mistake...!]
;W[lk];B[kj]C[yes it gets worse!];W[li];B[mj]C[Then I tried to fix it.. and guess what ? Yes even worse ;-/]
;W[lj];B[ll];W[ml];B[lm];W[mk];B[nj];W[cg]C[OK, now the game is over.

B has very few points on the sides, and W has entered the 2 zones where B could make points.]
;B[kh];W[ki]C[White is out in several directions now..

yes. 
Comments end here. No need to comment further, since it is endgame with no balance.

general comments :

1) don't get confuded by local fights / situation. You lost because you did not take big points instead of playing small and concentrated.

2) don't forget to spot and attack weak groups.
This will lead to influence, and therefore to more strenght on the board.]
