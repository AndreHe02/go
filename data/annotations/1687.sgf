C[Hi

I'm white and I request a review because it's a "nice simple" game that contain good teaching material I think.My double approach on the upper left corner went as I expected.A running fight results and I was feeling happy. Anyhow a few mising point make me blunder the rest of the game.

Thank you to GTL to make this review possible.];B[pd];W[dq]

;W[ic];B[jc];W[ed]LB[ic:A][ge:B][ib:C]C[spaciane: I felt that this fight was appropriate

Indeed, it would have even more appropriate, if 'A' were one intersection to the left. The reason is, that the stone 'A' at this point does not give you more eye-space or territory, but b has a good move at 'B' to support his fight or maybe 'C' for the endgame]
;B[ee];W[de];B[db];W[ge]TR[de][df]C[You see? It's sad that you have to remove some of the aji you left there with this move, which considerably hurts the marked stones]

(;W[fb]C[spaciane: Is G17 would have been better ?

No, f18 is ok. You have no eye space there anyway, s. var. to the last and the next move.]

;B[gj];W[ek]TR[bi][ci][di][ei]LB[ik:A][gl:B][dm:C]C[But that's bad. Look at the marked wall: 4 stones! Isn't it questinable to play a one point extension from a two stone wall?

But it is the wrong direction anyway. this wall is very strong for itself, it does not need an additional stone. The two groups in the middle are fighting each other. So you should add a stone there, maybe at 'A'.

But it's the wrong direction anyway. This wall is very strong and can easiely care for itself. The two middle groups are the ones who fight each other. So you should add a stone there, mybe at 'A'. If b then extends to 'B' it is time for a long extension from your wall, maybe around 'C']
;B[jf]LB[hj:A]C[B, too, plays from his strong side. He should definitly turn at 'A']

;B[rk];W[rh];B[po]C[All your groups are more or less save now, so it's maybe time to count. B's only territory is at the upper side of the board, maybe good 10 points at the left and 25 points in the middle, makes 35 points all together.

You have totally 10 points with your upper right group and when you get to play an additional move at the left, you have 30 points there, which is 40.

b has a weak group on the right and he has to play there some stones now, to make it save. This makes you playing some stones in this area, too. This way you get some additional points in the lower right corner and sente to play at the left. This should be enough to win.]

C[spaciane: without black misstake later in the sequence I would have end up with   nothing from this invasion.

Indeed, you would even lose a straight move! And as I pointed out a few moves before, you could easiely win by playing at 'A' now. If you do not count, you cannot choose the right strategy.]

Yes.];W[kg];B[if];W[ip]LB[do:A]C[Well,.... what's this?

B has lost his whole big territory and you lost nearly nothing. So you have a *big* lead now. Look at b's territory. Do you find anything? There is even no need to count to find out how big your lead is. This position calls definitly for the move 'A' to start a calm endgame. This way you'll win by at least 30 points.]
;B[fp];W[do]TR[kn][ko][dq]C[spaciane: J6 might have give me better results here.

Yes, might or might not, who knows. B might break in or live at the left side and it is not definitly clear that you capture the marked stones. If he breaks in somehow, does your marked stone or the whole upper group survive? No need for any risks!]

TR[fo]C[spaciane: I would have loose the game even if I defended the cut that will come

No, you lost there altogether 17 stones, which is more than the 32.5 points you lost with. Not to mention all the territory around the stones, which is now b's and would been dame. With your marked move you lost more then 20 points (b gained >10 and you lost >10), but you had still a 10 point lead at this point of the game.]

;B[mh];W[mi];B[ph];W[qj]C[All in all I think, there are two main weaknesses.

You have some problems in finding the correct fighting move, sometimes it is too weak, like #54 and sometimes to hard, like #60. But the biggest problem is maybe the direction. You often fight from the strong stones, not from the weak ones, #54 is again a good example to show this.

The next problem is the endgame. I think, you like middle game fighting (you even said something like this in the beginning), but you have to find a good point, when to stop it. There is no sense in fighting as long and as much as possible. When you find yourself with a suitable lead in the later middlegame, like in #99, you should immediatly forget about fighting and start the endgame. This was definitly a won game for you, you only had to win it...]
