;B[cd]C[Hi, I'm ebolaX (11K* on IGS), & I'm kind of new to this whole review process.

In any case, even though in the end I won by a good margin against my opponent (10K*), I felt that this was by sheer luck. White's strategic positioning was far superior far throughout the game. His large potential territory on the left side was of great concern for me, I want to know how I should've gone about reducing such a large space & WHEN I should've done it. Also, after briefly looking over my own game, I feel I have extremely poor judgement in determining big end game moves, something else I would like the reviewer to give me a few pointers on.

Review by John Rae IGS 5kyu

On reviewing the game I don't think white had the huge strategic advantage you imagine. Yes in the later stages white should have killed some of your invading stones, and that is where things went wrong and why you won. 

Your timing of the initial invasion was OK, although the follow through was less good. White missed many oportunities in this phase of the game. I think you should study where white went wrong - you can learn a lot about attacking from this, and that will in turn help build a feel for invading.

More generally :

You tend to leave groups without eyes and you tend not to attack groups without clear eyes. I think you should develop a greater sense of danger to stones - and more appreciation of how to attack making territory rather than killing.

Your end game is simply a matter of taking the time and concentrating. You already spotted the biggest mistakes in your own review after the game. The first step is to spot these during the game. :)

For the early stages of the game I would recommend looking at a wider range of joseki - not to learn them but to develop a feel for the kinds of moves that might be appropriate in different situations. 

Look at them and if you have a preference for white or black try to understand why the joseki are in fact an equal result. This will tell you what you need to study. For example if you always feel jumping into the corner in a pincer joseki leaves you worse off you need to work on your confidence at being able to nullify influence. 

Both sides ended up with quite a large number of live groups. It is usually easier to pressure, and thus reduce the territory, of small groups. Linking groups up give safety and removes the opportunity for such reduction. I recommend thinking more about connection.]

This is aking for big trouble.

Either you jump into the 3-3 point and accept you then have to deal with white's moyo or you try some alternative]

;B[bs]
(;W[dl]C[The white space between A4 & D8 kept him ahead for most of the game. What should I have done at this point, when white has such an overwhelmingly superior setup?


[JR\] This seems far to close to the white thinckness. White should have been playing further up the side]
;B[cg]C[[JR\] This is perfect to deal with the problem you asked about.

It stabalises the corner stone and it safely moves towards white's strength, not getting too close.

White D8 now clearly looks like a bad move.];W[ci]C[[JR\]

This move shows why white should have extened further in the first place.

a) it seems too close to D8 so a bit of a waste has occurred somewhere
b) its trying to make territory out of thickness - white should be hoping black will invade and then gain through attacking the invasion.

At this point, although its really to early to count "territrory" black has about 23 points fairly solidly.

White wah a much looser 21-22 on the sdie and more outside strength. Since the left can be reduced black's position is OK.]

(;B[jd]C[[JR\]

Fair enough but its a bit not one thing or the other. Its not a particulalry aggressive pincer and it doesn't do so much directly for the top corner.

I would be  more attacking. Either of the alternative seems lots better.]
;W[cc]
(;B[dc];W[dd];B[bc];W[cb];B[ce];W[bb];B[bd]
(;W[ec]C[[JR\] 

Compare this to the alternative I suggested a few moves ago.

White has more out of the corner than black and has a live shape. Black is not alive and squeezed between two stong black positions.


thats a pretty terrible result given black played in this corner first.

ALSO

White really didn't need to play E17. White should simply take sente and black is in big trouble.]
;B[pj]C[[JR\] This forms a nice area in the top corner and also works well if you push with R6.

I think you ought not have the time to play this - running with F13 might avoid future troubles.

You get away with it in the game but really should not have.]
;W[qe]
(;B[qg]C[[JR\] If you expected to pincer when white invaded why did you play Q10? It is already a loose pincer. In a sense black just gave away a move.]

(;B[gc]C[[JR\]

This is the wrong direction entirely

a) its no real threat to the white group in the corner
b) it does nothing to keep up any attack on the P15 stones

Yes it makes a bit of territory and you don't want whit to play along the top.

However its better to continue to press white first. Remember most of the time you do not expect to kill when you attack - you aim to use the attack to make solid territory.

Here M16 or S16 is called for.  S16 stops white jumpimg into the corner to make any eyes, and makes you big corner territory.  White will probably run some more. 

M16 makes the top territory solid and stops white invading there.]
;W[ld]C[ebolaX: Should I have gone at M16 first to secure my territory prior to expanding at G17?

[JR\] Yes  -white has just turned G17 into a wasted move. However white is also giving you the chance to split the stones into 2 groups so you have chances.]
;B[me]C[[JR\] Good!];W[ke]
(;B[mf]C[[JR\] 



M14 would be better for an attack. This pretty much forces white to push down - towards your group that does not yet have eyes.]

Black now has two groups in the top corner without eyes. This gives white great attacking options.

I would do something about that first.
