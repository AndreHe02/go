Hi Tod,

I hope you find this review useful.  I have gone through the game and given my initial comments before seeing the final result.  I have then gone through more carefully and with the benefit of handsight.  I find this approach is helpful because the first set of comments are what jumps out at me, while the second end up being a lot more accurate.

Thoughts from the second look.  The game started out ok with black taking a modest lead.  I think there were a few opportunities for you to catch up and things really got interesting once black's dragon got isolated.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qn];W[od]C[--
This seems fine but I would have approached black's shimari instead personally.  I can see why you wouldn't want black to complete this corner but I can't see a natural follow-up move for you here due to D16 being stable while I can see several for black on the lower side.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[pe];W[gc];B[cn]C[--
I don't like this move of black's - once you play F3 it makes black extending along the lower side miai with a pincer on C6.]
;W[ck]C[--
This is fine and works well with D16/G17, but I think F3 is fine too.  I would be worried about black sacrificing this stone in exchange for F3 and K4.]
;B[fq];W[eo];B[cq]
(;W[cp];B[dq];W[dm];B[fp]C[--
F4 feels wrong, it makes the lower side too open.  However I think this sequence overall favours black.  C6 still has a little aji and the whole lower side looks decidedly black now]

(;W[dn]C[--
There is aji there but this is too slow.  Black can play say L4 and be very happy.]
;B[pj];W[kq]C[--
very direct :)

I'm not sure how I would handle this position - the lower right still has lots of weaknesses which I would not want to fix.  Maybe Q2?]
;B[mq];W[hq];B[mo]C[--
That seems a reasonable result for you.  You get an acceptable reduction and if my reading is correct there is still a ko at R3.]
;W[ho];B[fo];W[jd]C[--
That is big, but I think F6 is urgent.  If black plays anywhere there then your three stones will be drifting and black can gain moyo while attacking.]
;B[ko];W[jp];B[jo];W[io];B[nf]C[--
That sequence seemed a bit ordinary by black, converting a weak group insto a small amount of thickness.  However it was the right idea and black seems ahead.

A move like C14 is big, the centre is important, and I still like F6 (though not so much now)]
;W[oi]C[--
Ok. that seems reasonable but I'm a bit worried black will just let you have the reduction in exchange for converting the moyo into territory.

Say black simply plays Q11 etc and lets you hop away, you've prevented a huge moyo the size of half the board, but you've given black over 50 points of solid territory.  It's a lot to have to convert on the left.]
;B[pi];W[og];B[oj];W[of]
(;B[ni]C[--
This is the second move of black's that really surprised me.  Even though it does not truly cut, P15 feels key to me.  I'm not sure why though, if you play it now then black can respond in lots of ways such as R13.]
;W[oe];B[jj];W[jl];B[jf]C[--
I think black should have blocked you there - your moyo is still very hopen whereas black's is almost territory, so mutal reduction favours you]

(;W[mh]C[---
This is good locally but I think I would have chosen M8 instead.  Maybe come back for this point depending on how things progress.]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[mi];W[lh];B[ll];W[li]C[--
M11 feels too direct, if black blocks then you can't cut off K10 that I can see, so I don't like it.  I would have considered L9 to force black to choose but if black chooses to connect K10 then you don't have much of a reduction left.  So I'd probably ignore the whole area and tenuki.]
;B[gj]C[--
oh, greedy!

Once black is cut off we'll get a fight for life.  I guess black will probably live, but it feels the game has suddenly got interesting for you.  Kill it and you win.  Don't kill it but attack it really well and you're ok too.]

(;W[fn]C[--
I think you have to cut off K10 from M8/N11 first.

If black lives then F6 does not get useful thickness, it ends up on dame.]
;B[im];W[il]C[--
right, you have to go after the main prize and let J5 live small.]
;B[hm];W[kk]C[--
ok, not sure about this.  I like the thought, but it looks like it just doesn't work.]
;B[kj];W[lj];B[lk]C[--
Yeah... I don't know, my reading is not strong enough to read it all out and be sure I haven't missed a tesuji somewhere, but it feels bad for you to me.]
;W[hl]
(;B[gm]C[--
I had expected black to hane.  I think you are suddenly in a really interesting position.]

(;W[gl];B[ej];W[fk]C[--
I prefer simply F8.  I don't like leaving the weakness at F8 for black.]

Your moves here don't seem wrong exactly but I would have played a number of them differently.  The atari at F14 could have been left as a threat in case you wanted to go at E13 instead, and you playing J13 was close to sente]

The game is over - with black's invasion a great success black just needs to protect the lower right to win.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[ib]
(;W[kc]C[--
I'm not sure this is needed.  The game is over but ignoring that, a tenuki from here to protect the uppre left would leave M18 as the key point (sse var)]

Locally that's ok, but finishing this in gote means black can protect the lower right and be so far ahead there is no way to catch up]

Something like this will alow black to destroy your central moyo, but only if black takes sente to do it.]

If you get a defensive move by black then a follow-up attack will be much more dangerous]
