C[nomadfire [6k\]: hi
rohnes [7k\]: Hi! Have a good game.

To the reviewer:

I appreciate your time reviewing this.

I think I got a good game flow for most of the game, and I ended up loosing due to reading mistakes, specially a reading mistake at move 145 that made it impossible to capture white's group. After that, I think I got behind, and I resigned after another reading mistake. At that point I was already loosing by about 20 points.

I don't like the fact that I made so much depend on capturing white's group. I'm interested in knowing what strategic and tactical errors prevented me from having a larger lead at the end.

Thank you.

Hello,  my name is Christoffer, and rank around 1-3kyu.
I have to start by saying that I'm not really experienced with chinese opening.
However will do my best.  I will try to start all of my comments with: "Nilsen:"]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[cf];B[jd]TR[dc]C[Nilsen:
Please take this with a grain of salt, however since wD17 already is low, 
and the corner is enclosed, I think it is bigger to play on the bottom side.
Aswell as you are playing low chinese, however take this as a grain of salt.]
;W[hq];B[ck];W[fk]C[Nilsen:
Strange move.];B[ch]LB[cn:A]C[Nilsen:
I think approching the corner with A is bigger.];W[df];B[cn]
;W[en]LB[mp:A]C[Nilsen:
Liking this opening for black, however the first player to get a stone around A will make a big difference.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[bq]LB[jp:B][kp:A][jq:C][kq:D]C[Nilsen:
This simply looks small at the time, and white will ignore and get sente.
To play somewhere around A-D seems getter and bigger.];W[mq]

(;B[cr]LB[eq:A][er:B]TR[bp][dp][bq][cq]C[With B19 I wanted to make sure I wasn't goint to have to fight to make that group alive.

Nilsen:
This is C2 and not B19, hopefully all my comments wont be on different locations when your viewing.
This is also small, and usually gote.
Marked shape also got some bad aji for white around A and B, see variations.]
;W[dr];B[bs]LB[cp:A][mq:B][br:C]C[Nilsen:
All of these moves looks small, and you have already given white the big move at B.
Usually we play A to get sente, and let the endgame cut at C for later.
However A removes some of whites aji.];W[nc]
(;B[oc]LB[jd:A]C[Nilsen:
Usually this is ok to play, however I do not like it in this situation.
We can read how this usually plays out, and can see that blacks A stone will get weak.
See var. for other common posibilities.]
(;W[kc];B[nd];W[md]
(;B[nb]LB[nb:B][mc:A]C[Nilsen:
I think A looks better and with B move you give white shape.

See var.];W[mc];B[ne];W[mb]LB[jd:C][lf:B][np:A]C[At this point, I think I could have played something around A to build a large framework. On the other hand, that would help white build her own, although a smaller one, so it should be better for black.

Nilsen:
I think your move in-game is bigger. if white gets a stone around B black is looking to run with C, and he have no stones to run to.]
;B[me];W[le];B[kd];W[lf];B[ld];W[jc];B[id];W[gc]C[Nilsen:
Big white mistake.]
(;B[gd]LB[ic:A]C[Nilsen:
Big black mistake.
Playing A should come to mind right away.
And is simply to good to not play.

Cuting into whites shape/line/side will cost him a lot, will most likly be sente since he needs to protect his shape.
See var.];W[fd]
(;B[ge]LB[hc:A][ic:B]C[Nilsen:
Playing A/B seems to be better.
You will most likly get something on either side, or atleast dive into his side.
See var.];W[hc];B[ig]LB[ie:A]TR[le][lf]C[This move was to protect the cut at A and attack the marked stones.]
;W[hd];B[he];W[ie]
(;B[if]LB[jf:A]C[Nilsen:
"A" looks to be a safer way to deal with the cut.
Less aji, and white will die in a net.
See var.];W[lh];B[kg];W[lg];B[nh];W[kh];B[kf]LB[if:A][jf:B]
C[Nilsen:
Here we can see how A move left behind Aji,
all the previous moves would not have affected the net(B).
However now you have to "go back" to make sure he cant cut.]
;W[qn];B[qo]LB[po:B][qp:A]C[Nilsen:
Do not touch weak stones.
A or B is usually played.];W[po]
(;B[ro]LB[qp:A]C[Nilsen:
Seems slow, A looks more natural.];W[pp];B[qq]LB[ro:A][qq:B]
C[Nilsen:
We see the mistake of A, B looks like the correct answer.];W[rn]

(;B[nq]LB[pn:A][rp:B]C[Nilsen:
Not sure about this move, I think cuting is the correct answer at A.
The clamp at B isn't life threating, its a lategame move.
See var.];W[np];B[nr];W[mr]
(;B[op]C[Nilsen:
Not sure if this is needed,
You are helping white protect his weaknesses.];W[no];B[qp]C[I didn't like this result. That corner group is now close to worthless.

Nilsen:
I agree, you should have cut white apart a few times already.
You are to afraid of it dieing.];W[oo]
(;B[cp]LB[pn:C][mp:B][eq:A]C[Nilsen:
Small and removes aji for white.
The peep at A might be usefull later.
Endgame move.

I think you should try to make use of whites cutting points at A/B
Neither of them works at the time, however finding a ladder breaker might be a way to continue.

See var.];W[dq];B[em]C[Nilsen:
Not sure how this helps.
If white just protects, you might get 5-7 more points, however you will help white secure the moyo.]
;W[dm]C[Nilsen:
White is being to agressive.];B[dn];W[eo];B[el];W[fm]
(;B[gn]LB[ek:A]C[Nilsen:
To agreesive.
Extending at A seems to be the move.];W[dl];B[ek];W[dk];B[ej]

;W[bl];B[cm];W[bh];B[cj];W[cl];B[bk];W[qh];B[qf]LB[pi:A][pj:B]
C[Nilsen:
When white plays to agressive, we want to push him against the wall.
Somewhere around A/B seems more natural.];W[pj]C[Nilsen:
Now we are under pressure.];B[pm];W[pn];B[oj];W[pk];B[ok];W[pl]
;B[ol]LB[qh:A]TR[le][lf][lg][kh][lh]C[I sacrificed the two stones to build a wall. I was targeting white's group.

Nilsen:
I do not think this was optimal, however it started because you pushed "A" from the wrong side.
This stategy might work. However we will have to play with care.]
;W[om];B[nm];W[qm];B[fn]C[Nilsen:
This seems to be good for black, however now we need to play secure.]
;W[co];B[bo];W[do];B[an];W[jn];B[gq]LB[lg:B][jl:A][gn:C]TR[hn]
[in][jn][kn][ln][mn]C[Nilsen:
If we can secure the center, we might win this game.
This move is asking alot.
Playing A might be a good move to secure the killing of B group.
Also gain some streanght for the B group.];W[gp];B[hp];W[go]
;B[ip];W[fq];B[iq];W[hr];B[in];W[hn];B[im]SQ[fn][gn]C[I didn't mind loosing those two stones. I just wanted a way to enter white's moyo.

Nilsen:
Those two stones are important.
and are your cutting stones starting the moyo.
Here we can see how black lost points because he thought it was more important to remove some points for white,
then securing his own points and center/moyo.];W[ho]
(;B[io]C[See var.];W[hm];B[lp];W[lo];B[kp];W[mp];B[jm];W[kn]
;B[mn];W[km];B[mo];W[kk]C[Nilsen:
The last sequence black might have played greedy.
However we was wining. there was no reason to wanting to kill everything.
If white manage to live now, we lose.
If we had just played secure we would have won.];B[ik];W[hk]
;B[ii]LB[ij:A]TB[bn][ao][ap][aq][ar][br][as]C[This was the reading mistake I mentioned at the beginning. I should have played A.

Nilsen:
I think this was the deciding mistake.
However black might be able to hold onto the win if he reads better then white for the rest of the game.
Reviewing reading mistakes is hard also I do not think you will benefit a lot from that.

So this will be my last comment.

In the future I advice to count your points and figure out which part of the board that is important.
I would stategy is good, aswell that you did good sacrificing some stones to attack others.
However around move 120 you stated to get greedy. Trying to take 15p from white, instead of secruing your 40p.

If you have any questions feel free to ask me on KGS. (Name: Nilsen89)
I had somewhat a problem reviewing the game.
As black played good untill the deciding moment of the game.
