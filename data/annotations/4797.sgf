C[David Lin: Hello, thank you for reviewing my game. In this game, I felt that I didn't know how to punish my opponent for extending too far, or how to put pressure on him when he invaded.

Three things you need to think about:

When you are attacking, you need to think about what you are trying to gain as a result. Are you attacking to make territory? build thinkness? something else? I strongly recommend the book "Attack and Defense".

When you are attacking, you need to attack with good shape moves. Otherwise your position will end up full of holes and your attack will crumble away. Generally this mean not playing quite so close to the group you are attacking, which is related to the 'Don't push the cart from behind' saying. In the middle of the detailed comments, you will find a recommendation for 'Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go', which I repeat here.

Third, you endgame is pretty bad. You are probably loosing about one or two points every 10 moves in this game, and over the course of a 50 move endgame that is a lot. The basis of a good endgame is estimating the score. That not only lets you know where you stand, but when you estimate the score, you have to look closely at every part of the board, and think about whether the territory there is decided, or whether there is a big move there. Hence you have a chance of finding the biggest endgame move. If you want a book about this, I recommend either 'The Endgame' or 'Get Strong at the Endgame'.

I hope this review is helpful.];B[dq];W[dc];B[pc];W[qq];B[qe]
C[All fine so far.];W[lc];B[jc]C[David Lin: I felt that white's extention was too far, was this the correct way to punish it?

Yes. White came too close to your strong position. After your pincer, white does not have space to make a 2-space extension along the edge.

And yes, a pincer is a good way to punish the mistake.];W[hc]
;B[je]C[David Lin: Maybe L16 was better (to prevent white from connecting underneath)?

This move is natural and good. The diagonal move is good too.]
;W[he];B[le]C[Good.];W[oc]
(;B[pb]C[This is a bit slack. It is better to hane on top first. See variation.]
;W[oe];B[nd]C[This is not a very good move. White has a weak group, which is a problem for him. If you threaten to cut it in half, you just give him a chance to sacrifice half of it creatively and make the rest stronger.]
;W[od];B[mb]
(;W[jb]C[This is not good by white. It is basically just an endgame move, and it is more important for white to defend his weak stones.]
;B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[ne];B[md]C[David Lin: Was this too slow? (maybe J18 was better)

No, this is good. The 4 white stones around P15 are now very weak and very heavy, and your black group is now virtually alive.]
;W[ic];B[pg]C[Good. You are making territory on the side while attacking the white group. This is an excellent plan.]
;W[ng]
(;B[ni]TR[pg]C[I don't think it is good to attack this way. It is a strong attack, but what are you going to get out of it? There is not much connection between the two marked stones, which means that white may be able to break through into the area on the side where you would like to make territory.

I think it would be better to just play a move that makes more territory on the side. That is a less severe attack, but white is still weak, and you can still get more profit from attacking.]
;W[lf];B[kf];W[lg]
(;B[mh]C[This is not a very good move. White is not about to make two eyes, so taking away eyes should not be your top priority. Once again, you need to find attacking moves that do something else as well.]
;W[me];B[ld];W[oh];B[mg]C[Same comment as before. This move thinks only about taking away white's eyes (at a time when that is not important). It does not do any good for you. Actually, it makes your position a tiny bit worse. The stone at N12 ends up with only 3 liberties, not 2. Look for a better attacking move that achieves some other aim at the same time.]
;W[mf];B[of]C[Bad move, for the same reason as before.];W[og]
;B[pf];W[nf]
(;B[ph]C[This is better, it attackes while making territory on the edge, but it is not the right move locally. A knight's move is better. It gets one line further along the edge.

This move is 'pushing the cart from behind', which is bad. There is a whole chapter about why in 'Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go' by Kageyama. It is a very good book.]
;W[oi]
(;B[pj]C[This is not the right shape. It is too thin, as you find out later. The knisht's move is right again.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[oj];B[pk];W[qm]C[It is very dangerous for white to play away from his weak group.]

(;B[ok]C[Wrong shape again. Again, it is too close to the white stones you want to attack. The diagonal move is better because it leaves your stones stronger. In the long run, your attacks will be more effective if you build strong positions while attacking. The moves you play may look more foreceful in the short term, but in the long term, your positions crumble and white escapes.]
;W[nk];B[nl];W[ol];B[ml];W[mk];B[lk];W[lj];B[kj]C[This is good strong play, if your position is strong enough to make it work.]
;W[li];B[ki];W[kh];B[mj]C[Well done.];W[nj];B[lh];W[kg]
(;B[jg]TR[ll]C[This may not be the most important place to play. You really need to play two defensive moves at the marked points, and the other one might be better.

Also, the purpose of a move here is to keep white separated. If you want to do that, the other diagonal move might be better. Again, don't play too close to the group you want to attack.]
;W[jh];B[ig];W[pl];B[ll]C[David Lin: I felt that this was much bigger than the P9 group.

I think you are right, but it is a lot to give up. This is what happens when you attack with thin moves.]
;W[qj];B[qk]C[David Lin: I thought for some reason that it would be better to end in sente, with the top-right sealed off, but B S10, W takes, BS11 would have been better?

No. Sente is definitely more important.];W[rj];B[ri];W[rk]
(;B[de]TR[ki][kj][lk][ll][ml][nl]C[David Lin: Bad approach? maybe C15 would have been better?

I don't think an approach is right at all. The main thing you got out of the fight in the top right is the marked thickness in the centre. You need to think how to use that. The two moves in the variation might be better. 

If you must play in this corner, Perhaps C14 is best. The danger with a close approch is that white might pincer.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[cj];B[ec]C[Good.];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb]
;B[dd];W[cb]C[David Lin: do I need to play C8 now? my group in the top left feels very heavy.

You are right to be a bit worried about the top group. However, C8 is very important, and you have time to play it first.]

(;B[fe]TR[cb][eb][fb][ec][fc][dd]C[This is not a good way to defend. Think about the whole group, not just the two stones at the top.

In response to the three marked black stones, white played the three marked white ones on the second line. These are not very good white moves, so you don't have to worry if later the black stones get captured and turn out to be worthless too.]
;W[cm]C[Now white's group on the edge is strong and you can't get any profit by attacking it.]
;B[co];W[jq];B[hq];W[jo]
(;B[pp]C[David Lin: was M3 better? I didn't like the sequence that followed.

I think you are right. The important thing is to isolate the two white sones at the bottom. They are vulnerable.]
;W[pq];B[op]C[David Lin: Maybe O4 better here instead?

Yes, that might give you more chance of isolating the stones at the bottom.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[mq];B[lq]C[I really don't see the point of this move. It is just going to get swallowed up.]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[lp];B[nq];W[nr];B[jr];W[ir];B[iq];W[kr];B[jp]
;W[kq];B[kp]C[This just does not work. White ends up connected and gets sente to push at H2 which destroys a lot of your area, and you get very little in exchange.]
;W[ko];B[ip];W[lo];B[nn];W[hr];B[gq];W[gr];B[fq];W[bn];B[bo]
C[All the groups are now pretty much alive, so this is a good time to estimate the score. (You do try to esimate the score while playing, right?)

White top left: 20-, right side: 10+, bottom right: 25-, left side: 5+. Total about 60.

Black top right: 20, top: 5, middle, 5, bottom left: 15, top left: 5. Total 50. 

So you seem to have a problem. Especially since white has sente and there are big moves he can play to pull further ahead.

Of course, it would have been even better to estimate the score earlier, say before you play K4, then there would be more chance to base your strategy on the balance of territory.]
;W[qp];B[gc];W[gb];B[dl]C[David Lin: how should I press down on white's group? is it too settled to be attacked?

Well you have got to try to find 15 points profit in the process, and that looks really hard. This is an OK idea. B11 is also worth considering.]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[dm]
(;B[ck]C[This is bad You are filling your own liberties again.]
;W[bk];B[em];W[dj];B[en];W[ej];B[bf]C[David Lin: I realize that I should have gone E8, or F9? but B14 seemed very big, and would help settle that group?

This is a really strange time to play B14. F9 obvously. Your only chance is to keep the white group on the edge weak.]

;B[cs];W[gs];B[dr];W[fs];B[in]C[Good, you have made a bit in the middle, but then white's area on the edge is also bigger, so you have hardly caught up.]

;W[nm];B[mn];W[bh];B[ii]C[This move is small. How many points do you think it gains? 3? 4? in gote. White T11 is 5 points sente. It would be a lot bigger to prevent that.]
