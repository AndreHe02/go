;B[qn];W[ql];B[on];W[np]C[The next few moves feel very submissive. I allow white to push me around which results in two of my groups struggling to live or connect. The alternatves seem better, I'm unsure how white would have responded.

*** I think your next few moves are perfectly reasonable.  You both ended up with weak groups, and the outcome becomes very sensitive.]

TR[lg][mg]C[*** I am not strong enough to tell what the ideal moves and sequences are in this position, but I keep looking back at the triangle area as being pretty critical.  The M4/N3 exchange did a lot to help your lower group and a move in the triangle region can help your other set of 3 stones.  Even though that will push white against your corner, you'll overall exit the fight more stable.  Once that happens, you should be able to pick between continuing your attack on the N3 group or the N8 group.  They should more or less become miai]
;B[lq];W[ne];B[nc];W[kl];B[ng]C[*** I do not like this exchange.  While I'm not sure if the O13 contact move is necessarily bad in this situation, I think things get bad for you once white gets two replies to this move.  Continuing to push on white is likely to remain sente and will help ensure you don't get pushed around]

;W[ch]C[I feel I gave up the side to easily for fear of losing the connection. White's shape seems interesting, but maybe I overestimated its strength?

*** I like the variations you showed much better than the actual play.  D11 is a virtually free sente move that you should take advantage of.  I think there are alternatives to D14 (such as C14) which would secure your side better and leave the connection options open enough that you're probably ok]
(;B[ff];W[di]C[*** Also, take note of C8.  Once white gets this, C8 is reasonably placed.  If you took D11 first, White would have to work to defend that stone and would not be getting side territory so easily]
;B[dn];W[fo];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk]C[*** White can ignore this, best to find a move that gives better profit]
;W[dj];B[fn]C[*** a contact move that ends in gote for you.  This is not developing much in the center.  Especially when contrasted with all the profitable forcing moves white makes over the next 30+ moves, you can see some of what you could have done instead.  There's also the lower right white stones that you should probably kill outright instead of leaving the possibility for white to live there.  Ultimately, killing those stones is what secured your win...]

This is probably sente because black M16 likely kills.  Even if they counter attack and gain some strenght in gote, you can resume attacking the bottom and the game will probably feel a lot better for you.]
