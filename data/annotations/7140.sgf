C[This is the strangest game I have ever played against the computer.  I play black and gnu go plays white with a 7.5 komi.  Although I did end up winning this game by ~10, I really think it's only because the computer didn't realize he could kill weak groups of mine in the lower right on two different occassions in the game!  So it seems like if the computer was just a little better in that one specific skill (that I guess computers are notoriously bad at), I would have been totally destroyed.  And I can't figure out how I found my way into such weak positions.  Also there is a lot of fighting in this game that I'm not used to, owing to the strange opening I think.  So I'm sure there are lots of mistakes there too that I need to learn from to make my play able to cope with different styles of games.

*: Hi, Please enjoy the review, if you have any questions feel free to mail me back.  The game at first glance seems you are rushing it.  I'll try to comment on the move as I see them.  You might have played a similar move later on in the game; this just means I thinking the timing of your move was wrong.  I'll try to give you examples of for each move I have doughts about.

*: Interseting game .. you turned it around after middle game. The computer seems really weak at end game.

Few general observerations:

1) You need to make sure your groups are strong before you attack it gives you more chance to move around.

2) Life and death still lacking a bit.

3) You followed white around for first half of the game at least, that is not good for you if you want to get ahead.

4) When you are not sure where to play count.

5) When deciding the playing moves in openning:

- First Corners
- Approach an open 3,4 corner.
- Second Close corner.from 3.4
- Expand from Side.

*: I hope this review is good for you.. it was interseting game.  Had to think alot on few areas on how to play .. hope this helps you. THanks.]
;B[pd];W[dc]C[I normally play parallel fuseki, but playing 3-4 this way seems to ask to be challenged at D4 to me..

*: Nothing wrong with it, just be prepared for the fighting :).  Parallel fuseki is a more relxed starting, its always good to experiment thats how we learn and grow stronger :).]
;B[dp];W[qp]
(;B[jj]TR[ce][de][op][oq][nq][np][df][cf][dj][jp]C[I never play tengen, but the corner situations all seemed miai!  It's looking like a strange fighting game, the kind I'm really not used to.

*: I see your reasoning; but whites moves at D17 and R4 are both nice moves to take space on the side.  Right now priorities is the marked direction.]
;W[hd]C[I couldn't understand this move really..];B[op];W[oq]
;B[nq];W[pq];B[de]C[i left the weakness at O4 on purpose to try to seize the chance to play in every corner..

*: Good try, but you have to be prepared to give up P4 or have a plan for it later.  See Pro's do it and it really seems strange; but they are weighing in cost.

i.e. You have following cases:

1) Black followings the normal path at O4.
1.1) Black ends in Gote; white takes initiative up top.
1.2) Black gets nice solid base on the bottom; and white gets a base on top; but now black has sente to make another base on top-right.

2) Black stops the play on bottom right like you and takes initiative on top left.
2.1) White might not answer your D15, and cut at O4.  What will you do?  Do you plan to scrafice P4 or O3, or both?  And take two moves on top?
2.2) White answers you and you play out the sequence a bit and come back to bottom?  This is a bit of wishful thinking that white will just follow you around...

My prefrence here is to play out O4 because you have a stone in center; getting a strong base on bottom will be an asset to you.]
;W[np]
(;B[mp]TR[mq]C[*: I went through many pro games to find an answer to O4; and in most cases the answer was TENUKI.

The reasoning in my mind is there is right now no GOOD answer to O4; to early to decide which side is going to help you more.

If a pro did answer it later in game it was with N3.

Reason?

One less move to play, the result is same; look at example please :).]
;W[no];B[mq]C[*: See you had to come back and protect your weakness; this is why N3 directly is prefered over N4 atari.]
;W[kq]
(;B[jp]C[*: I don't like this move; your stones might come under attack when white plays L4.  I would play M5 because it puts pressure from far away and gives your group space to move around :).

*: Please look at example ..];W[jq]
(;B[iq]C[*: Hane at head of two stones is really nice when you want complications; here you need to find the safety as L4 will be hard to deal with.

I recommend J4 and then L4 to make a good solid connection; this strenght will help you later in game.]
;W[kp]C[the N3 chain is already feeling pretty heavy to me here, but i'm not sure what i should do or should have done earlier..

*: Yeap now the pain starts? see why J3 was bad idea?  So question come what would white have done if you did play J4 instead?  Please look at example.]
;B[ip];W[mo];B[ko]C[*: Don't get so focued in this early in game you got the entire board to pay with so start with something else ...]
;W[lo];B[kr]C[*: I don't think this works ... I tried few different paths here all lead to death because of weakness at K5 :(. Sorry I can't show you how to make that alive.]
;W[jr];B[lr];W[kn];B[jo];W[ir];B[hr];W[hq];B[gr];W[hp]
(;B[jn]C[the K5 chain has really bad shape..

*: Hmm naa it's fine, look at H5 example.];W[lp];B[or];W[pr]
;B[ns];W[ps];B[os];W[hn];B[mr]C[i wasn't sure why he let me live here?  i guess he does get a lot of compensation elsewhere; if i had played H5 instead of him playing H6 things would be very different on the outside

*: I think it's computer being computer; it's 25 point move.  Very worth killing, there are bigger moves on board, but normal rule is 1 stone = 10 points? so by that it's 250% efficent to kill the black group.  Just computer didn't look carefully enough :).]

C[*: NICE :)];W[ed]
(;B[ci]C[*: Not Nice :p.

Correct move is F14.];W[ch];B[cj];W[eg]C[heh another heavy chain of three at D14.. this one seems to have more potential though]

(;B[dh]C[*: Yes you can connect but not this way .. look at example please.]
;W[dg];B[eh];W[fh];B[ei];W[cg]C[*: That was unneeded :(.];B[fi]
C[*: This move looks good because it stopps the atari; but your group in center needs more attention right now.  You need to play K8 as it will cause issues if later.]

(;B[do];W[en];B[dn];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd];W[mf];B[ld];W[jl]
C[*: Last 11 moves have been following the master around the board .. you are answering whites moves .. you need to learn to play your own game. 

*: Please look at move 66, on how you can stop following white around...]
;B[il]C[*: I think J6 first... is a good idea.];W[in];B[ln]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[ik];W[qj];B[ql];W[po];B[mj]C[i felt pretty good about the way this knight's-move trapping-tesuji worked with the surroundings..

(;W[pi];B[ol]C[*: need to defend against your weakness by playing M9.]
;W[dr];B[cq]C[*: Again your answer white; yes he can play C3 and takeyour coner; but you can take initiative on top to reduce him there.]

B: 10

Black (Tri-angle): 39
TL: 15
L: 22
B: 2

So looking at that we need to rrecover some points badly..

*: So right now follow moves are sente (Marked X):
C2: Worth 5 Points
S18: Worth 2 Points
F7: Worth 10 Points];W[bf];B[fe];W[gh];B[gg];W[hg];B[hh];W[ff]

[jo][jn][ko][ln][km]C[*: Interseting move; letting you save your stones on inside for all of right side ... I have played this area the most and I am sorry you can't save both groups :(.  Thats why having weakneses in groups near by is never good.

So lets get down to numbers

Losing inside group (trinagle): 20 Points

Letting white take all of right side: 30-40 Points.  So I think it's time to save your outside group and let go of the inside group :(.]
;B[lk]C[*: You saved your outside group but inside group is dead :(.]
;W[mm];B[kj];W[nk]C[it's pretty scary for P8 and R8 now.. i don't know if i can afford to let them die, but saving them seems pretty hard and i think i only end up saving them out of luck to be honest..

*: I agree you can't afford to let them die .. but I cannot find a way to let black live no matter what I do :(.]
;B[rk];W[rj]MA[rn][rm]C[*: White can answer you at "X" not here .. and it makes it very difficult to see a path to life.]
;B[rn];W[pk];B[rp];W[rq];B[ro];W[nj]
(;B[ee]C[i thought the stone around S6 probably had a small life now.  but actually looking now i think i did need another move, i'm not sure

*: Actually the bottom right is still killable you need another move there look at my example.]

(;W[bh];B[bi];W[ig];B[ie];W[jd];B[je];W[fd]
(;B[he]C[*: This move is not good because it doesn't catch the marked stone you need to catch them before they run away...]
;W[kh]C[*: And white makes a run for it :(.]
(;B[hb]C[i was happy i saw that i could get something here.  i probably did it too early though (especially if my S6 area needs another move..)

*: Yeap really nice move but G7 is nicer and more important to stop white from runing your space there ... ;-) .. Think about what will happen if white plays G7?  How much you lose? looke at the example :).

*: lets explore the point difference? 

*: Concolusion G7 is more important .. 
reasons?

1) G7 threatens the group below.
2) Secuires your space above.

H18 good but not very important right now..

1) White can afford to lose some space  because he can simply save that group with G16. But he can cause you alot more damange with G7.

2) H18 ends in Gote :(.];W[hc]C[*: aa white dogues the bullet :P.]
;B[ib]
(;W[rb];B[qb];W[fm];B[fl];W[gb]
(;B[ha]C[:* Important?  Yaa looks like it but bottom is more important white left a weakness captalize on it.

you playing H19 gave you 1 Point.
If white played H19 he would have gotten 4.  Making that move worht 5 points.

I think you can more the 5 points on bottom...];W[gm];B[ga]

*: Good idear];W[bg]C[at this point i tried to count how things were looking for territory and thought that i had about 66 and he had about 69, so i was a bit worried..]
;B[ar]C[because i thought i was behind on territory, i didn't want to play a gote move.  but i thought for a long time here and decided i did need another move at A2
