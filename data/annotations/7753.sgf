C[Thinking: Hi, thanks to anyone reviewing the game!];B[qd]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[do];W[cm];B[en];W[em]LB[gq:A]C[TM—Consider playing at A instead. Black will be very happy if he can build a wall facing his 4-4 stone at Q4; sliding to A will prevent this from happening.]
;B[fm];W[dm]LB[el:A]C[TM—This is fine, but it is considered an old joseki. The modern joseki is to play at A instead.]
(;B[fp]LB[fl:A]C[TM—Interesting move. Now, keep in mind that you had been expecting black to play at A; that suggests that it might be a good move for you also. It would build an ideal wall in sente, working with the D16 stone. This is a critical part of the board since both players have 4-4 stones reaching out to a wall.

You might have been worried about the corner, but black's move here isn't really committed to taking the corner (yet). He would have to play another stone in gote to make it his territory.]
;W[co];B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[dr]C[Black can no longer invade the corner and live in a ko, like in the joseki...]
;B[fl]SQ[cm][dm][em]C[TM—At this point, this is essentially joseki, but with the moves in a different order. But black has the upper hand since he is controlling the centre, and the influence of your marked stones has been significantly reduced.]
;W[jq]C[The bottom felt big and open, I was afraid of black making a lot of solid territory there, so I tried to reduce it a bit.]
;B[mq]LB[lq:A]C[TM—Black could use the strength of his wall to play the more severe move at A.]
;W[gq];B[er];W[jo];B[qn]TR[ip]C[Should I keep jumping with my group, or is it safe as it is?

TM—I would suggest first making a forcing move (where?) to get an extra stone on the board for free. You should be worried about this group, since it's in the middle of a very strong black territory and doesn't have a secure base. Jumping out would be wise.

Another useful technique: threaten to connect to your other stones. (Where?)

Finally, note that the marked space is an ideal place for black to strike at the group. Luckily your opponent didn't seem too concerned about attacking you ...]
(;W[pq]LB[mo:A]C[It felt as if black's corner would be quite large if he got all of it, so I gave an invasion a try.

TM—Indeed, black's corner is too big (R6 should be at R5). You handled this very well. Another idea would be to cap at A, giving your stones some breathing room and reducing black's influence.]
;B[oq];W[qp];B[qo];W[op];B[po];W[or];B[nq];W[rq]LB[qr:A]C[TM—It looks simpler to play at A instead.]
;B[pr];W[qr];B[qq];W[gn]LB[go:A]TR[ip]C[TM—Good. I would feel a bit more comfortable at A instead, which forces the same response from black but gives you a tighter shape. The marked space is still vulnerable.

Also consider that from here you can't really play F5, so black's group is relatively safe and you can't put the same pressure on him like you could from A.]
;B[fn];W[pq];B[ps]C[It surprised me that black didn't want to fight this ko, I hardly have any ko-threats left!

TM—Indeed! Perhaps your opponent expected you to chase him with P1, at which point he would resume the ko. Black has many threats against the bottom group; alternatively, he could just play a big move like K16.]
;W[qq];B[nr];W[ro];B[rn];W[sp];B[fc]LB[jm:A][km:B]C[TM—This is fairly painful for black: he has spent a lot of time building two walls that aren't being used. It would make more sense at this point to mount an attack against white (e.g., around A or B).

Nevertheless, black is dominating the centre. For white, I would recommend erasing black's potential as much as possible, not to mention protecting your bottom group, when the opportunity presents itself ...]
;W[cg];B[db];W[cc]TR[dd][cg]C[I have understood this shape is better than C13 being at C14, is this correct or false info?

TM—Yes. Usually with the wide extension as you have marked, black would rather invade the corner at 3-3 than slide as he did here.]
;B[ic]C[TM—These last three moves of black's aren't consistent with his previous plays since they are so low. This would be an ideal opportunity for you to reduce his influence. (Where?)]
(;W[oc]LB[od:A]C[TM—This seems dangerous to me. Black will be tempted to press you against the edge and stake out territory on the right. How about A instead?]
(;B[pe]LB[od:A]C[TM—Black should consider playing A instead since he is so strong on the right.]
;W[lc];B[qj]LB[md:B][nd:A][le:C][pi:D]C[TM—A couple of comments about this move. First, black should press down at A first, followed by B or C. Second, R10 is too close to black's strength below; playing at D instead (let's say) makes more sense with a moyo strategy.]
;W[le];B[pc];W[od];B[fj]LB[oj:C][jm:A][km:B]C[My group below is being swallowed, I wonder why I didn't do anything about it.

How should I have protected it?

TM—Yes, it is being swallowed. Black could digest it more quickly, however, by playing a more direct capping move around A or B. This move (F10) is slow.

As for you: if you're worried about your bottom group, remember that you have a forcing move at F2 that you can use any time. And it's not too late to jump out to A yourself, which would certainly make your group a lot safer and would reduce the effectiveness of black capping the group.

If you think your group is safe, then you should be concentrating on reducing black, especially since he's playing such low moves. What about playing at C, for example? (Compare to black having played there instead of F10 ...)]
;W[qh]LB[pi:B][oj:A]TR[qj]C[TM—Risky. I would prefer to cap at A or make a shoulder hit at B. Note that this invasion does not survive later on ...

Also note that black's marked stone would have been better placed higher (say at B), as I mentioned earlier. Black is overconcentrated on the bottom.]
;B[ph];W[pd];B[qe];W[qc]C[TM—This is big, but it seems that the centre is more important right now.]
;B[rc];W[pb];B[jm]C[TM—Finally!];W[lo];B[mm];W[lr];B[mo];W[ln]
;B[mn];W[kl]C[I laughed at my mistake while playing the game.

I thought black would try cutting at M7 instead of L7.

After playing this move I immediately realized my silliness.

TM—Oops! The outcome of this fight was that not only was L8 eaten, but your bottom group was also put in greater danger. Imagine the difference if you had played K7 before letting black play there ...]
;B[km];W[lm];B[ll];W[jl];B[im];W[ml];B[lk];W[mk]LB[oj:A]TR[qh]
TW[pc][rp]C[All my resistance is futile, I know.

Black should've simply kept extending, instead of all those hanes?


TM—Well, black can do what he likes, it's his territory. :) But seriously, yes, black might have been wiser to extend rather than hane here. He wouldn't want those two stones to get caught in a ladder, for example ...

As for your resistance: wouldn't it have been nice if R12 had been at A instead?]
;B[mj]
(;W[nj]LB[lj:A]C[TM—You could cut at A first, hoping to get more forcing moves out of black. See variation.]
;B[lj];W[ok]LB[nh:A]C[TM—Hm! This looks like wishful thinking. Play lightly instead, for example at A. Your stones are asking to be swallowed here.

And let me repeat: wouldn't it be nice if R12 had been at P10 or Q11 instead?]
;B[ni];W[oi];B[oh];W[pi];B[qi];W[pk];B[qk];W[ql];B[pj];W[oj]
;B[rl]C[At this point I realized everything was lost.

TM—In that case all you have left is forcing moves, and the order is very important ...]
;W[ri];B[pl];W[rk];B[qm];W[rj]C[TM—A good effort so far.]
;B[ql]
(;W[pg]C[TM—But here: what forcing move can you play before this one?]
;B[og];W[of]C[TM—Same comment applies: make this a more immediate forcing move by cutting at O12 first.]
;B[ol]
(;W[qg]C[TM—Please see the comments for the variant.];B[oe]
;W[ne];B[qb]LB[pf:B][ng:A]C[TM—This is your chance! You can either save your stones on the side and let black fight for the corner, or tryto kill the corner right away while risking all of your stones.

I'd prefer to save the stones immediately, with A then B.];W[rb]
;B[pc];W[qa];B[qc];W[nb];B[sc]C[TM—Another chance to save your stones ...]
;W[ra];B[pf];W[nf];B[rf];W[rg]C[I thought I could win this capturing race, but I lost it.

Black won because his eye is bigger?

TM—He won because you got greedy! This kind of situation happens to me too: I wonder how I could have won a capturing race, but often the solution is simply to save your stones earlier ...]
;B[sg];W[sh];B[sf];W[se];B[sk];W[dj]LB[gp:A][lq:D][fr:B][gr:C]
TR[kl]C[TM—Now that the fight has been decided in the top right, I would seriously consider defending the bottom group. Remember that your miscalculated cut (the marked stone) damaged your group by strengthening black. Possibilities include A, B, C, D.]
;B[ik]C[TM—A bit overcautious on black's part. But as white, I would *really* think about defending the bottom now.]

LB[ip:A]C[TM—???

This makes no sense. Black's groups are invincible here and white is vulnerable. Go for the kill!]
;W[jj]LB[jh:A]C[TM—Looks too deep. Black could cut you off with a move like A. Remember his stones are extremely strong here so you will have difficulty manoeuvring.

Watch what happens to this stone later.];B[jk]C[TM—Submissive.]
;W[kj];B[kk];W[jd]LB[jc:A]C[TM—Just A is better. (Of course, better yet to defend the bottom.)]

(;B[ds];W[cr];B[cs];W[bs];B[es];W[bq]
(;B[io]LB[ip:A]C[TM—Hm! Only now does black seem interested in poking at this group of yours that's deep within his territory. And even at that, he's being quite timid about it. Count yourself lucky.

At the very least, black should play A. (Recall that this is the critical point for this shape.) What happens if he does?]

;W[cl];B[sn];W[so];B[dn];W[lp];B[mp];W[sb];B[sj]C[TM—This loses a point in gote.]
;W[ei];B[ii];W[gj]C[I was aiming to capture two stones or connect to my stones.

TM—Good tesuji. Black must choose between the stones on the left and the stone above.]
;B[hj];W[el];B[gk];W[kh]C[TM— If your K10 stone hadn't been so deep, you might have felt more comfortable simply following through and eating the two stones.]
;B[ek];W[nh]LB[jh:A]C[TM—Play solidly at A instead.];B[nk]

C[TM—For the past few moves it looks like you've been trying to build territory. But what territory? This gives you a handful of points that black can reduce anyway by playing L14. The tactics you were using are perhaps better for large-scale territory building.

Instead of all this, just save the marked stones.];B[cn];W[bn]

I'd love to know things like my weaknesses and strengths, what to focus on, fuseki, chuban, yose, tesuji, L&D etc.


TM—Summing up:

Black won the game even though he seemed to play quite sluggishly sometimes. He played quite a few gote moves, and didn't ever bother to attack your bottom group in earnest, but this was enough for him. Why?

I think that you misjudged the direction of play in the bottom left and top right corners, allowing him to build up a large moyo. But then you invaded too deeply and lost many stones. Just imagine the difference if you had played shallow reducing moves instead! (Go back and see what happens to moves 58 and 148.)

Some principles:

* Don't play too deeply in solid enemy territory. (58, 84, 148).

* Reduce your opponent's centre influence by pressing down on his low stones. (50, 58)

* Think about good shape. (36)

* The order of forcing moves is important. (102)

* Don't try to create territory when there is none to be had. (95+)

* If you get a chance to save a group, take it! Save first, fight later. (109)

* Protect your weak groups!

I hope this helps! It was my pleasure to review the game.
