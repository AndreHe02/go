C[Hi I would like a review of my game, please.



I took white in this game, I play as odif on kgs.



I would like to know where I missed out

and in general some hints to help me improve];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[de];B[fq];W[cm];B[eq];W[cr]LB[dc:B][od:A][po:C][dq:D]C[The last move of B looks weird.

Your stones already have a secure base in this corner. So there is no need to answer the last Black one.

How about A, B or C?

If you really want this corner to be yours, D would be better. But its better to leave those for later]
;B[cd];W[dd];B[ce];W[cf];B[cc];W[dc];B[bf];W[cg];B[bg]
(;W[bh]LB[df:A][ch:B]C[Not good as it leaves 2 cutting poinst at A and B.

Black can't take big profit by crawling the 2nd line. Let him crawl as long as he likes.]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fd];B[jd];W[pg]LB[ld:C][nd:B][od:A]C[very strange; Black can connect (B) and get much territory.

Something like A would be better as it seperates the Black stones.

Even C may work if you can drive Black into your wall];B[oc]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[po];B[op];W[iq]LB[pl:A]C[Your move may be good, but there is a defect at A. I think it would be better to play there first as it secures your stones.]
;B[fo];W[lq];B[mq];W[mp];B[nq];W[mo]LB[lo:B][kp:C][lp:A]C[very slow; although it protects the cut at A for now, you may have to come back later. so  something like A, B or C is better.]
;B[oo];W[pm];B[on];W[nm]LB[om:A]C[This looks like black is peeping at A, and white will protect it next. 

Unfortunately black is playing next; 

Your move doesn't connect as black at A will leave 2 cutting points which are not easy to protect.

white at A would be better];B[pn];W[qm];B[qn];W[om]C[You are lucky. You only lost 2 stones ;)]
;B[rn];W[fl];B[gn];W[in];B[hm];W[hn]LB[gj:C][jk:D][fl:B][gm:A]
C[No!

Never cut where is nothing to cut. Black at A will be an easy connect even weakening your Stone at B.

How about C or D? ... driving the black stones (which has no base) into the void.]
;B[gm];W[im]LB[hk:B][ik:A]C[slow!

how about A or B?];B[hl];W[fj]LB[gj:A]C[Better, but also slow.

A would be more pressure on black.];B[md];W[mg]LB[ij:A]C[No!

Your move IS big, but something like A would give black a hard time to survive. ... and black _must_ survive there, or the game is lost.]
;B[ik];W[kk]LB[hg:C][jg:A][gh:B]C[right idea, wrong direction.

Black now may be able to connect to the top.
I think something lik A B or C would be better.];B[lj];W[mk]
LB[kj:A]C[Black again is peeping your stones.

A would be better.

The groups are seperated and Black cant protect both at the same time.]
;B[jj];W[hd]LB[kj:A]C[Very smal move. It does not attack nor protect and the territory you get is not worth the move.

A is a must!];B[ic];W[mj]LB[kj:A]C[A!];B[li];W[mh]LB[mh:B][kj:A]
C[No. A may still work.

Black can't slide into your territory, so there is no need to play B.]
;B[lg];W[kj]C[very late ...];B[ki];W[ji];B[ii];W[jh];B[kg]
(;W[jg];B[jf];W[hh]LB[hg:A]C[A, or you loose your stones];B[ih]
;W[hg];B[gk];W[ig];B[fk];W[ej]LB[el:A]C[I think i would have played at A, trying to kill the black group.]
;B[ek];W[dk];B[el];W[dl];B[hi];W[em]LB[rf:B][gi:A][jl:C][rm:D]
C[too smal.

doesnt do anything and i dont think black can be killed any more.

How about A-D?];B[fm];W[gi];B[en];W[dn];B[jl];W[kl];B[jm];W[kn]

Both would be bigger :)];B[ll];W[mf];B[ne];W[ke];B[je];W[pf]

(;W[qk];B[rj];W[sl];B[sk];W[qj];B[ri];W[qi];B[rh]C[I think the game is lost now.

there are only few weak point by black left.

It looks to me if you do not like to fight. 

you didnt really attack some black stones and mostly tried to protect your own territory.

keep away from strong groups and play where are weak ones.

some of your stones where wasted by protecting secure territory.

And ... even if the last stone of your opponend needs an answer ask yourself: is there something bigger? Think as if the next move is the most valuable move in the game :)]
