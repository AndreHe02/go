C[Hello,
My name is Max MÃ¤kinen, im a Finnish 9kyu, DGS 8kyu, KGS 10kyu player.
This is the first review im making so please ask any questins you might have.
My answers are by no means flaw free and should be always taken with a grain of salt,
but ill try to give as good comments as i can.

[cq:C][hq:B]C[I thought this was weird. Well it's not that it's never played or anything but i don't see it often. Your thoughts?


Answer :
This is a standard attack move when white has a stone at A, but as such its rarely played.
It does not secure the corner for white, and gives black a nice trouble free extension on the
left side. White also usually finishes this with F4 leaving a weakness at B.
Remember that C is still invadable.];B[dn];W[fp]TR[co][dp]C[Ill enter some variations here on how to enter the 3-3 point with the marked white formation.
It does not mean that you should play there now, but i just add them to demonstrate that it is still possible.]

(;B[cj]LB[ci:B][di:C][dj:A]C[Here i think you should play at A instead. When having a moyo it is a good idea not to limit yourself.
The fourth line always gives more pressure on white.
 
You could also think about playing B or C, this will work better with your earlier D17 stone, this will give a mini chinese form and make it hard for white to approach at C15 or D15. 

The space between C6 and D11 will however be quite wide and open for invasion.]
;W[nc]C[This move is a quesi enclosure, making it hard (but still possible) for black to take the corner.
A quite normal move for white perhaps would be O3, trying to take care of the H3 weakness.]

(;B[ce]LB[jd:C][qj:B][hq:A]TR[cj]C[This move is perhaps a bit early. It is always big to seal a corner, but you dont need to do it yet. White will find it hard to approach D15 or C15 becouse of the C10 stone.

Some moves instead of C15 worth considering could be A, B or directly C.

Ive added some variations to move 10 showing you what happens when white playes C15 or D15.]
;W[qn];B[nq]
(;W[on]C[I thought this was a strange move I asked him about it and he said he wanted more influence. I thought the normal sequence here would definately be better for white. See the variation i suggested to him. (he said he doesn't like it).

Any thoughts?

Answer :

P6 is sometimes played when white wants to increase his moyo on the right side. The problem in this situation is however that the extension is so large that white can not really expect to get too many points there. Black can usually answer but playing S4, securing him the corner.]

(;B[jp]LB[cq:B][hq:A]TR[co][dp][fp]C[This move is better at A. A gives more pressure to the marked stones.

One of the weaknesses of a stone on the 4th line, is that the opponent can approach on the third line.

Please remember that B is still also playable, the corner is not 100% whites.]
;W[hp]TR[cq]C[After this white H3 i would play C3 in order to reduce/take away his corner.]

(;B[qf]LB[jc:A][qd:B][qf:C][cq:D]TR[pj]C[I was wondering which one to play. Whether at R14 or at K17. Looking back,  i think K17 was better. By the way that's what my opponent played. Well around it anyway.

Which one was better? R14 or K17?

Answer :

It is definetly big to play on the right side, white will make a very strong position if he gets to play Q10.
The problem however is that blacks moyo will be bigger if he gets to play K17 and K15.
In my opionion the biggest move is perhaps K17. All the moves from A-D are currently big in my opinion. You should notice however that R14 that you played leaves white a good attacking possibility at R12 or R15. I added some variations.]

(;W[jd];B[hd];W[ic]LB[ge:B][hf:A][qi:C][rp:D][cq:E]C[Instead of answer at H17 which is quite a low endgame move. You should ask yourself if there are bigger moves to play. Please consider the moves from A to E.]
;B[hc]LB[jf:A][ph:C][qh:B]C[This is ofcourse also a correct move. You get quite a large corner.
White will however not play M16. Instead he will put pressure on your R14 stone and at the same time increase his moyo. A-C are some moves white should be considering at the moment.]

(;W[ld];B[qi]C[I think R11 is a very good move at this point.]
;W[qe]LB[pf:A]TR[on][qn]SQ[qi]C[Usually i would have played at (A) but because of the triangle stones, i felt that the square stone would be too close to my Q-R 14 group. So instead i decided to extend to the center while putting a little pressure on the triangle group.

But not playing at (A) gave white a lot of thickness which ended up to be where most of his territory came from.

what do u think is the best move here?

Answer : I think Q14 is the only move. You do become a bit heavy but while playing in your opponents sphere of influence you have to expect to come under attack. Q14 makes your group very safe, and it is always important to make sure your own groups are safe before attacking your enemies groups.]
;B[oj]LB[pf:D][qk:A][mn:C][qp:B]C[White still has A-C to take care of his stones, its quite difficult to close these stones in, and you have a big weakness at D.]

(;W[of]C[White should play Q14 instead. Please see the variation.]
;B[pg];W[og];B[jn]LB[ph:A][pm:B]TR[on][qn]C[again i tried to put some pressure on the triangle group. I saw the hane at (A) but i decided it wasn't that big of a deal.

That is good thinking, remember that you also have a peep at B.]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[rf]LB[mj:D][jl:A][ql:B][pm:C][qo:E]TR[on][qn]
C[If your original plan was to attack the 2 white stones , you shouldnt worry about a few points on the right side. Your R11 group is already safe, the move white made at S14 is a small endgame move. 
You should here continue your attack on the 2 white stones.

Please consider moves A to E.];B[rg]C[This move is only worth a few points, please see the comments in the last move.]
;W[pf];B[qg]C[White can still at this point take care of his stones by R9 or preferable jumping out]
;W[re]TR[on][qn]C[

White S15 is also small, he should naturally take care of his 2 weak stones in the bottom right.]

(;B[qk];W[nh];B[mj]C[White is in much trouble. I think this is a good move.]

i think C11 would have been better than C13 because it makes it harder for him to connect to the bottom.]

actually if you have a good site (for example on sensei's library or something) about yose it would be great.

now i have some general questions.

My major concern is studying go. I am a busy student (since i participate in sport teams and stuff other than school) and i don't have much time to study Go. Most of all, i don't know how to study Go.

I really think i need a teacher. (I am self taught up to about this level but i find it hard to advance). But i live in china, and i don't speak chinese. What a shame since china is such an advanced country in Go. Besides i am Japanese so i learned my go rules in japan and i think the chinese play with a slight variation.
So because of these, it's pretty hard for me to get a teacher.

what are your views on how i should study?

Also i have another question. In go you have to "read" before you play. I hear of people (not pros because they are just scary but just normal amature players around 5K up) saying how they read wrong and stuff. Well if you are wondering "what's this guy saying? doesn't he read before he play his moves?" wll the fact is i try to. However, i don't know what the correct way to do it is. Do you just put imaginary stones on the board? Or so you imagine the shape? or do you simply do it mathmatically, like calculate the liberties?

Anyway thanks for your help, any advice would be greatly appriciated.
