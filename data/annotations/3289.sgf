C[Hi. Thanks for reviewing my game. (I played black)

I started this game with a plan. Just to see how long I could keep it going.

My idea was to start with double 3-3 opening, then keep my opponent from building whole board moyos, and try to make stable groups everywhere; if my opponent started to build moyo, then I would invade, having the invading group as the only weak group on the board.

But, as somebody wisely said, no plan survives enemy contact :)

LoP: Your fuseki is ok. In the middle game fighting i think some of your moves lack force and seem to be too submissive. 
I think you have little problems with forcing moves. There are a few moves in this game that look more like 'thank you moves' to me. I pointed those out in the game.]
;B[qc];W[dp];B[qq];W[dc];B[cf];W[cd];B[ci]
(;W[gc];B[jq];W[gq];B[mc]C[Up to now, things were going according to my plan. But maybe P16 or Q15 were better?

LoP: This moves feels a bit slow to me, i'd probably play R10 and try to build something big on the right side, but i guess that's just personal style]
;W[qe];B[qg]C[LoP: good];W[oe];B[oc];W[og];B[pi];W[jc]C[LoP: White is extending into the direction of black's strong and low position this is a mistake]

(;B[op];W[pl]C[LoP: I think this is a white mistake again. He shouldn't make another weak group here.]

(;B[qn]C[LoP: This move seems to lack fighting spirit. White can treat Q8 as kikashi now and play P11.]
;W[rl];B[me]C[LoP: I like O11 better since it strenghtens the q11 group.]
;W[qf];B[ni]C[Yes, my group is weak, but I didn't care much about that because I figured that both white groups were also weak, so I could afford it.]
;W[mg];B[li]C[LoP: Maybe i'd play O8 instead trying to enclose the white group]
;W[qm]C[Now, in these few next moves, white settles his group. Anything I could do to prevent it? Or maybe I should have played S10 earlier?

LoP: S10 was not a move worth playing earlier. I think it wouldn't be a big problem if white lives small here as long as his group is enclosed. So O8 instead of M11 looks like a good alternative.]
;B[pn];W[rn];B[ro];W[so];B[rp];W[qj];B[pg];W[of];B[ri];W[qi]
;B[qh]C[LoP: Poor black has to make bad shape. Now it looks like S11 was a bad move.]
;W[rj];B[oh]C[LoP: Yes very important.];W[kg];B[ji];W[jg]C[LoP: White has strange style :)]

(;B[kd]C[LoP: This looks like a bad forcing move helping white more than black. If your aim was to protect the O16 defect then I think there are better moves available.]
;W[jd];B[ff]C[LoP: This move is not very effective. Of course you destroy the possibility for a small white moyo but i think it would be  better to play around C7. Buiding something up yourself while also limiting white's potential on the bottom left.]
;W[co]C[Damn, I wanted to invade below... but I always thought it was too small... anyway, I hadn't played C8 before only because it would cause white C5, so I thought I should play C8 now, as it looked big. Was it good reasoning? Is it big enough? Or maybe K6 or K5 is bigger?

LoP: I think C8 is big enough];B[cl]
(;W[mp];B[mq]C[I expected white M3, black O3, M4, K6....


LoP: If white played M3 then attacking from the strong position with black O3 would be a mistake. (see variation on previous move)]

;B[em];W[gn];B[gl]C[Just making points in gote.... I know this is supposed to be wrong, but I didn't know what else to do!!!

LoP: Hard to find a really good move for black. G8 seems to be ok although black will not be able to make something big from this moyo.]
;W[hm];B[jl]
(;W[im]C[LoP: Strange move i think just h8 is better since it doesn't help black.]
;B[jm];W[hk];B[hl];W[hh];B[fh];W[hj]C[LoP: Strange move again. White should treat H9 like a kikashi. Since that was his intention when playing H12.]

(;B[hd]C[This is where I win the game.... I thought at the time I was losing up to this point.... but now I am not so sure... according to my best estimation now (at the time of writing this), white is ahead by a couple of points (after komi).

Could you please confirm this count? Also, any tips on how to count more accurately would be greatly appreciated.

LoP: Mistake. Black should connect at L15 instead.
My Count (see variation)]
(;W[ke]C[Here white loses the game. From now on, I was confident I was ahead, and played more calmly.

Not yet, see variation on move 156 (next white move)];B[hc]

(;W[jf]C[LoP: Big mistake];B[ie];W[rh];B[rg];W[si]
(;B[nh]C[LoP: You should really stop playing moves like this. Maybe you think "Well it's sente so it can't be bad." but the truth is every unneeded move is bad. You don't profit from this move it only helps white. Not only does black lose this move as ko threat but he also loses the possibility of playing at O13 instead later.]

My Count:

Black:
top right ~ 18
bottom right ~ 20
left side + center ~ 30
58 + 1 prisoner

White:
top left ~ 30
bottom left  ~ 30
right side ~ 5
65 + 6 komi 

i think white is ahead by a small margin.
