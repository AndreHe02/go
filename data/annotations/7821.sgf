C[Hello. Just wanted a quick review in the upper right hand moves. My opponent killed the group with elegant efficiency. I would like to know how I could have responded better. Thanks.]
;B[cd];W[pp];B[ec];W[cp];B[pd];W[dj];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc]C[I would have gone for a looser pincer here as it could be a good extension from your left corner.  As it is, it just seems random.]
;W[ne]
(;B[le]C[This move was a mistake, the normal response is Q14 so that your corner doesn't get surrounded (like it did)]
;W[pf]C[This seems an important move by white (Q14) as it isolates my black piece. Should I have moved here?

You needed to retreat and make a base in the corner.....instead you coerced him into hurting your stone even more.....]
;B[pg]C[Mistake, avoid touching enemy stones unless you have to.  Also, this pushes him into your corner.....]
;W[pe];B[od]C[Should this have been R17 or perhaps R16?

Anything but this, it's very slow and doesn't enable eye space OR escape.  It's pretty much over for your corner at this point.]
;W[nd];B[qe];W[qf];B[re];W[rf];B[rc]C[Would R17 have been better?

Not really, though I'm surprised he didn't try to kill you yet.  He must have been being nice since he is 5k and you are 14k.]

;W[hq];B[gq];W[hp];B[dq];W[cq];B[fn];W[dn];B[fl]C[What did you gain from this?  A weak group that is escaping into the center.  Escaping groups don't make territory.  White, on the other hand, strengthened the left side and the bottom right to some extent.]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[ml];B[nk];W[in]C[Now white has claimed a big bottom right, invasion is very hard.]
;B[dh];W[dl];B[fj];W[bd];B[bc]C[I think I focused to long on this local area.
Should this move have been C15?

This move forces you to choose between the side and the corner, so either one is ok depending on what you want.]
;W[ce]
(;B[be]C[Don't be tempted to atari just because you can.  Often it is what the opponent wants.]
;W[dd];B[ad];W[cc];B[dc];W[bd];B[oc];W[ob];B[cd];W[qi];B[cb]
;W[ql]C[The reason this was possible is because your stones are all on the 4th line.  White put his hand right up your skirt.]
;B[de]C[Yes, what are you doing while white is taking big points away from you?]
;W[qm]TR[nk][nl][om][pm][pj][qn][rn][pg]C[Now you are in huge trouble.]

probably.....anywhere but taking that one insignificant stone.]

;W[ng];B[oh];W[pi];N[RESULT]C[Result: W+R

The main lesson to take away from this is to think about the whole board.  Don't coax white into attacking your stones, that is too nice to him.  Also, don't get boxed in, and beware of stones that are too high.
