(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]C[i think you won the game in result, but lost in content. this was a kind of moyo game. i recommend you to read basic fuseki(opening of game) books. if it is available, Takemiya's would be good.]

 herve 9k*: of course];W[dd];B[qp];W[pd];B[co];W[op];B[mq];W[pn]C[q3 was not elegant move. first impression move was p3]

(;B[pq];W[oq];B[jp]
(;W[jd];B[cf]C[should be s6. it stabilize black, and weaken white.];W[di]
;B[ff]C[thin move. invasion directly to c17 was preferable. or, at least e14. white should follow var 2.]

(;W[gd]C[also thin move.];B[cc]C[inconsistent strategy. you make heavy c14 group and weaken it.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[eb];W[ec]C[for keeping, f17. white blunder here and black lost chance. see var2]

(;B[dc]C[this move helped white.];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb]C[black was sealded in miserably due to d17.]
;B[ck]C[good direction. but because e9 become very good move, higher version(d9) may be better.]
;W[df]C[too defensive move. white is already strong. i prefer f9. it is good because mak!
