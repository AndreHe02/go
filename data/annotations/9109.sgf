AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Cshan51:  284 hi

Whoops... forgot to say hi... (using a new program so I could not see where the chat was...)

I am black (opetrenko)

Thank you so much for reviewing my game whoever you are! (wanna make the file generic)

I am pretty sure (don't want to speak too soon...) that my rank has some adjusting to do as I have settled to 11k/12k on KGS my last few games... but having an advantage is good time to look for sloppy mistakes.

Hello, I will be happy to review your game. My rank currently is 6k at KGS ('naamdrager'), but lately I have been studying to try to improve some more. I will review both sides, but will pay special attention to your questions.

Some general remarks: 

I think it could be good for you to experiment some with a more influence oriented play. Try to build walls and moyos, and try to forget about direct gain of territory. You might discover that influence often easily converts itself into territory in later stages of the game. Don't be scared about invasions inside your spheres of influence. Spheres of influence arent 'yours' yet, they are just areas where you have an advantage, so you can chase your invading opponent and build walls for yourself, getting territory in the end.

Furthermore try to be more precise in considering which points on the board are biggest. Omitting too small moves, and playing a smart tenuki here and there can make you gain lots of points, for which you dont have to fight or take risks at all.]
;W[jc]LB[pp:A][qp:B][pq:C]C[In a handicapped game, white almost always plays her first move in the corner that is still open. Simply because in the corner you can build territory and influence most efficiently. Moves on the side like K17 come second. 

A would be most common in this position. Moves like B or C are less often played, mostly because they more or less ask for another move later to complete the corner shimari, while white wants to develop very quickly around the rest of the board, to compensate for the handicap.]
;B[qp];W[nd];B[oc];W[nc]C[Never sure if this is a good exchange but happens often in my  handicapped or 4-4 starting games

I would say this is a good exchange for white and black should not want this. Two stones facing a three-space extension is an efficient combination.]
;B[iq]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[I think I did this chinese opening wrong as it should be closer to the 3-4 stone than the 4-4 stone.

Indeed, L3 or L4 would be more balanced and better. But black should not play here! The upper right needs another move, like A or (less often) B. Without this it will be very easy for white to isolate the black stones in the corner on the outside, and get big center and/or side influence (see variation).]

(;W[op]LB[fc:C][cf:A][cj:B]C[White should apply pressure on the upper right now (see variation). If he should play elsewhere, it should be somewhere more open, like A, B or C (C working nicely together with his stones on the upper side).]

(;B[mq]C[This move was somewhat new for me but it made sense even without the stone at J3

I think this move is OK. It leaves the corner open, but it is a nice extension along the side that puts pressure on the white stone. The variation (more common in my eyes) looks also good, with white tightly surrounded. As I said, I think white should have not played here.]
;W[nq];B[mp]C[wonder if this was a wise exchange... getting locked out of my former corner?

2 stones facing a three-point extension is very nice for black. No problem if white goes for the corner, since you can nicely play around him and gain nice center and/or side influence.

Don't see anything as 'yours' in this stage of the game. There is no territory, only influence. Regarding anything as 'yours' too soon will impair your judgement and flexibility :) .]
;W[qq]
(;B[qk]C[The idea here was a 2 point jump to either side of the inevitable response move (either R6 or R12)

I think the R4 stone is too important to leave. And you can use it to pressurize the white group, and gain nice influence. See the variation.]
;W[qn];B[qh];W[qc]C[This invasion seems possible to me, but it is too early in the game for such an invasion. Black can use it to build some influence.]

(;B[qd]C[This seemed like a no-brainer as it preserved spoiling the corner for white and securing the right side.
 
You can also choose to fight, by P18 or such. White will live in the corner and you get outside influence. See variation.]
;W[ob]
(;B[fc]LB[cj:A]C[Big dilemma for me in handicapped games when I have have the 4-4 corners is the limitations of the 4-4 point.  always conflicted about when it is appropriate to just place a 3-3 or perhaps an overkill 2-4 stone to secure a corner.

Not a really good move. The extension is small with little perspective towards further development, and it leaves the corner open for invasion. A move around A has much more perspective and works nicely together with the two corner stones. Remember that especially in the opening it is important to play in the more open areas (as long as there are no urgent plays elsewhere, of course).

I recognize your thoughts about the 4-4 points in handicapped games. But do not focus too much on making territory. The 4-4 points mostly mean influence, and with influence, territory usually comes naturally. Don't force your plays too much towards territory only. Playing for territory from the 4-4 stones will result in inefficient moves.]
;W[pc]
(;B[od]C[I doubt whether this defence is big enough to play. Whites gain by capturing P17 is not so large.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
(;B[qf]C[Up to this move felt like pseudo joseki (I have been warned about learning joseki without understanding exactly why each move is a fair exchange and why some moves are not)

Whites gains quite a lot here in sente. Maybe you could have prevented this by playing S17 in sente a few moves earlier (see variation at move 17).]
;W[oe];B[qe]
(;W[pg]
(;B[fq]LB[cj:B][dj:A]C[Excess of liberties for my R15 group made me deem the R13 cut as not being big enough to justify ignoring all the juicy territory waiting for stones on the third lineon the left of the board.

R13 is no real cut since you can connect with S13. I think Whites aim here is to build some thickness towards the center. Not very succesfully though, since his formation is loose and will have cutting points (O15, O13). The variation would give better center influence for W. It was good to play tenuki here.

But, still, the open space on the left is begging for a play around A! F3 results in a too dense and thus inefficient shape. After A or B, white will have some difficulty invading and living on the left side (while he will have to invade, since black territory all along the left is unacceptable). This difficulty you can exploit to build walls and gain influence.]
;W[cj]C[Now white is on time, and has lots of space to extend.]
;B[cf]LB[cd:A][ch:B]C[I somehow feel that there is a weakness here by doing a 6-3, 4-4, 3-6 enclosure as opposed to a 6-3,4-4,5-3 enclosure...

Although I am not exactly sure, indeed I think that white can still live in gote with C17. See http://senseis.xmp.net/?AllAbout33PointInvasion%2FDiagrams .

Therefore this move is not so efficient. It neither really protects the corner and neither really pincers the W stone. It is better to do one of the two. A would protect the corner, B (better I think) would attack W.]
;W[dn];B[cl]C[Here the flanking move was mainly intuition and reinforcement from books (not sure if I did it exactly right).  The moyo of the stone seemed too good to pass up.

Seems like a good move to me. White stretches very far, and leaves a nice point for you to cut her in half. You are in black's sphere of influence and one of the two white stones should face serious trouble now.]
;W[cn]
(;B[bp]LB[el:A]C[This move was about securing the corner while using the moyo of the C8 stone to keep sente

But now you give white the opportunity to attack your stone. Never give your opponent's weak group an easy target to attack. Your opponent will very easily use it to strengthen his weak group, and you will have lost all your opportunity of exploiting your opponent's weak group.

I don't think you have so much to fear from white B4. While black A nicely attacks white C10.

General advise: keep in mind the bigger picture, and always choose big influence over small territory. Influence may seem weak or undefinitive, in the end it usually pays off. Another rule of thumb is to always try to stick to your original plan. Your previous move split white in two, now you must play A to keep her in two.]
;W[bl]C[Now your C8 stone is under severe attack, and W has a living group with center influence. Notice the difference with the result of the two variations from mv 33.]
;B[bc]C[The enclosure in the top-left left me a little nervous about a 3-3 invasion

I think C17 would work better. Stones on the second line usually arent so good unless in close combat or endgame or such. 

It is too early for such a move however. You do not have to fear the 3-3 invasion at all, since it would leave you with very nice outside influence, and is gote for white so you get a nice extra move to choose. Also this move has only local effect. In this stage of the game, preferably play moves that influence your whole-board position.]
;W[gd]LB[fn:A]C[Not a bad move for W. Now she threatens to build nice center influence. Maybe A would serve the same purpose even better, because A is a point that black also wants to occupy very much, and whites left side group could still use some reinforcement.]
;B[gc]C[This move seemed to be a no-brainer.

At first I had some doubt since H16 does give white center influence, but indeed the difference in side territory is large.]
;W[hd];B[rm];W[rn];B[qm];W[pn]C[I was wary of building too much wall for my opponent.

I am not so sure. His wall does not do as much as your wall (it only faces the corner and some nearby white stones). See the variation for what could happen if further build such a wall.]

(;B[ch]LB[ne:B][og:A][fn:C]C[Worth noting that at this moment I felt confident I was going to win by a wide margin.  The main thing I was extremely careful of was preventing any major portion of the center from being enclosed.

I don't know if you are ahead so much. Along the sides you have much territory, but your position towards the center is weak. There are still a lot of points there for both of you to score. White has very nice center aspirations in the upper right part of the board. However there are important weaknesses, see A or B.

Furthermore C has become very, very big for both of you. It is important to be able to spot such kind of key points. C is much more interesting than the played move, which was quite passive.]
;W[eh]C[Not a bad idea by white, but his stone floats a bit. Black can break through at both sides. F6 is bigger...]
;B[fn]C[Good!];W[el];B[di]C[Nice.];W[ej];B[ei];W[fi]LB[fh:A]
[fj:B]C[I think it was better not to push, unless you know that you can follow up by cutting at A or B. If you can't, you are helping white to build a wall towards the center.]

(;B[eg]C[Moving one line further (see variations) I think could help you cut through whites wall.]
;W[fg];B[ef];W[ff];B[dj];W[dk];B[dh];W[fh]LB[ng:A][jj:B]C[The outcome of this is bad for black. White now has very strong center influence from three sides. 

A or B could now be good points for black.]
(;B[jj]C[The wall I had provoked from white on the left was making me nervous so I felt this one was necessary.

Looks like a very good move now.];W[hn]C[Interesting to see what follows from here. Black could attack nicely with G7.]
;B[in]C[this was overconfidence on my part I think as I ran a huge risk of white cutting off the center stone in my zeal for territory.  I end up paying for it by barely keeping the bottom left corner alive but I think making and maintaining a connection to the stone either by the bottom or right side groups was the overriding priority.  Still in retrospect I wonder if a better move would have been a non-contact move.  P9 to come at it from another direction?  Risky would have been G8 maybe... or N6/N7 to really break open a connection possibility from right to bottom?  Dangerously conservative may have been L4 or L3...

It is often said that you should never make a contact move from a strong position of you, to your opponent's weak stones. The resulting fight will usually make his stones stronger. I think this will happen here as well.

I think G7 could work as an attack. The white stone will have difficulty fleeing to connect. K6 also forces white to flee to H8 or so, in the same time reaching towards your center stone (K10). This might be a safer option.]
;W[im];B[hm]C[I felt that with all the moyo of black stones nearby I could only benefit from a windmill cut exchange...

Sounds like a good thought, but you with this you give white a big choice of forcing moves (ataris), one of them might just work out for him.]
;W[ho]LB[jn:A]C[Consider A here. It threatens J7 with a ladder, and leaves your own stones with more liberties. See variations (I think essentially white can now choose which half of the cross-cut will be captured by B).]

(;B[io];W[hp];B[ip]LB[gm:A]C[At this point I was being a little dumb as my oppoenent could really have done some major territory making work on the top-half of the center or threatening maybe to connect off the J7 stone to the bottom right group

Don't forget your center stones has N10 to easily reach towards the right side. I think for white it is now best to atari at A and then connect to his stones to the top/left.]
;W[gn];B[gm]C[Very dumb position to set myself up in (not sure exactly what I would have done differently but I know it was most definitely something...).  I was ultimately forced to deal the monstrousity at H6 to keep my center connect.

Again, don't forget that your center stone can also reach for connection to the right. The board is very open there. You seem a bit too concerned about connecting your center stone to the bottom.]
;W[fm];B[fj];W[ek];B[il]C[Another "brilliant" (very sarcastic just to be clear) move that could have cost me my F7 group AND my bottom center territory.]
;W[fo];B[jm];W[hq];B[hr];W[gr];B[ir];W[gq];B[fr];W[fs];B[es]
;W[gs];B[dr]C[At this point I was keep a watchful but somewhat relieved eye on the bottom left corner]
;W[cq]C[A nice move for white at this point. It hugely complicates the situation by the many cutting points which can be created by pushing at D3 or C4.]

(;B[dq]LB[cp:A]C[I think this is the wrong choice. With A, white would be nicely sealed in, if I am right.

Now white can push at A, then B3 and cut at D5 or B5.];W[cp]
;B[co]C[Should have gone to B3 and then C5 maybe? Or my opponent would be forced to do defend some on the left side and I might have taken sente...

I think it would also be possible to play B3, let white connect and connect with C2. But simply C4 would have sufficed.]
;W[bo];B[cr];W[bq];B[eo];W[do];B[fp];W[en];B[br]C[Bottom left corner is alive with perhaps one ko threat...?

It looks unconditionally alive. Or do you mean the ko threat for black at A3?]
;W[ar];B[mr]LB[jg:C][og:E][ol:B][pm:A]C[Too small. This is a move for (near) endgame. There are still big moves on the board, deciding over center influence. Consider A, B, C, D.]
;W[nr]
(;B[mn]C[DId not expect to make all that bottom middle territory but there it is...]
;W[qg];B[rg];W[ph];B[qi];W[pj]LB[jg:A]C[Very big sequence for W. His stones which were weak are enforced, and he builds further towards center territory. However with A you can make his walls pretty meaningless.]
;B[ib]C[Probably should have been wary of this building a wall leaving me only the bottom to invade from...]
;W[hc];B[hb];W[kd]C[I have no idea why my opponent went here instead of J17 or K18 (well K18 would split the groups but I doubt I could have encircled the F12 group)

I do not get this move either. K18 would be big for sealing the top side. However K12 might be bigger.]
;B[kb]C[I remember thinking "why am I stretching my neck out for my opponent" when I did this move but I felt like my two-stone groups at F17 and H18 had enough liberties to avoid chain effect (provided I watched it closely).  Also gave me a cut threat at N18 to cut at O18.

No threat at all, more than enough liberties indeed. Still K13 should be bigger.]
;W[jb];B[ja];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk];B[ri]C[This is one I was glad I took my time on as it would have been life and death in a worst case scenario for a cut off group in the top right.]

(;W[sl]C[If I had been white I would have gone tenuki or maybe P8

Strange move by white. R8 could be interesting and lead to a complicated fight.]
;B[rl];W[sm];B[sk];W[sn]C[This connection is far too small. It is important to always looks if there are bigger points on the board, also if the local position does not look 'finished' yet.]
;B[jh]C[Seemed like I played it risky to wait so long before doing this.  Once it was done things seemed to be looking VERY good for me (I think...)

Very good! Both sides should have played here much earlier indeed. B could also consider jumping one point more, to K13.]
;W[ki]C[If I was white I might have done some contact play with the K12 stone to see if I could salvage some territory in top-left center or top-right center...]
;B[ji];W[mi]C[I don't know whether my opponent was thing I was trying to make territory in the center (I most certainly was not expecting to nor did I make territory there)... a threatened connection by placing at L13 seemed more sensible.]
;B[of]C[This one was a little ill conceived but served its purpose somewhat...]
;W[pf];B[pi];W[se]C[I probably could have gotten away with going somewhere besides S14 after this move but...]
;B[rf]C[... things seemed to be going well enough to just play it safe and not leave any unneccesary game-changing ko threats.  Just for the record G10 and N18 had been begging for my attention (N18 especially)]
;W[sh]
(;B[oj]C[Miai T13/T14 followed by T11 or S12 left me 1 liberty in the clear but nontheless with a move for white at T13 that if I did not answer would then be a ko threat if they connected at T14.  So instead I started a ladder that would walk straight into my scary double wall!

Sounds like a good reasoning to start the ladder. But cutting at O15 could also have worked out very nicely (see variation).]

Unneccesary move, there are much bigger moves on the board. Lots of center territory is not decided upon yet.]
;W[lf];B[oo]C[(159) Cshan51 has run out of time.
(159) B+T

My opponent ran out of time but I "think" (not being sarcastic just trying to show a little humility and respect) that it was more or less a resignation at this point (though not by as much as I thought at first).  The moku of clear territory was on the order of White 50-something and Black 60-something with a strong lean of prospects for both enemy reduction and territory expansion very good for black.

My move at P5 exceeded my desire to play J14 or more likely B10.  This move seemed like a golden opportunity to at worst build a wall on the right while keeping sente and at best a chance to cause havoc. 

I think the other moves are bigger than P5. P5 actually does quite little. It allows white to extend into indecided territory in sente (see variation).

CGoban score estimation here says B+12.5, with lots of center territory undecided. Although of course black has better chances, I think that a smart endgame could still work out well for W.]
