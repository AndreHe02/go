C[In this game, black shows a better sens of fuseki than white.
But black didn't use this advantage and miss  the opportunity  of launching a splitting attack.
White takes the lead during the middle  game in "close combat".
Here are some general advice that may be helpful for both players :   1) before invading your opponent moyos, develop your own group.
2) when you are close to opponent forces , play lightly.
3)When it's possible,separate your opponent forces and try to connect yours.
4) avoid to let you confine your groups.
5) When it's your turn to play, look at the whole board and list the status of all the group of stones.( safe, in danger, close to opponent forces..).
It helps you to choose the right move.];B[dc];W[dp]C[when white  play in this corner, it leaves his opponent the possibility to play a " cross fuseki" (  to play in q4 corner).   It's playable, but it's important to think of it.   If you want to avoid your opponent to  separate your fuseki stones, juste play in the opposite corner ( here play  around q4).]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[ce];W[cg]C[there are 2 things to say about white  c13 stone :  1) it's too close to black corner. Black is strong in this area. Don't play close to your opponent forces.
D10 would have been a little  better. It's a the right distance of black corner, and it's the right distance to develop the white hoshi in d4.
2) If you want to approach a shimari ( the 2 black stones in the upper left corner), play at the other side.
K16 is the perfect extension for black shimari.
So  white should have play k16 to take the important point, wich also is the right extension of q16...]
;B[jd]C[Very good move. it's the right extension of black shimari]
;W[gd]C[White play in a jealous way.
the upper left side is under black control. There are a lot of moves to make on the rest of the board before invading at g16.
White does not developp his stones.
His 2 corner stones are left alone.
Because his fuseki is better , black is leading now .];B[md]
C[o17 is playable too.  I don't know which is better.];W[fc]
C[White should play in the direction of the center ( g14 for example), because :  1) white cannot live here, there are too many black stone
2) f17 move has no effect on the black corner.   Anyway, this move is too slow.
When you are close too opponent's forces, you must play lightly.
Now white  add a stone in f17, he has to save his group ( 2 stones = a group).

I would have play d10 instead of f17.
Because d10 developp d4 stone, and is the right way to "save" c13.


Now, blcak can launch a spliting attack by separating c13 and g16.
White is in real danger..];B[eb]C[If black want to avoid white live here, h17 is far better.
Black corner is safe, no need to add a move to live.
It's better to split the white stones, with a move around  e15 , e14 or f14.]
;W[ec]C[Too slow, it's better to try to connect the 2 groups of stones with a move around e14 or f14]
;B[dd];W[fb];B[db];W[cf];B[hc]C[Once again , e15 is the only move to me, and for the both players ....]
;W[be];B[bd];W[de];B[cd];W[ee]C[Black loosed his chances to split the white stones.  It's a very good and unexpected  result for white,]
;B[dn];W[af]C[Now black corner status is very complicated.
Black should add a stone at b18 to avoid a very difficult life and death problem.

Black should never let white close him in the corner.];B[cp]
;W[cq];B[co];W[bp]C[

Now black has a lot of good move :  b3 and e4];B[bo]C[black move is too nice.
Black lets white do what he wants
Black should play e4 or b3.];W[aq];B[ck]C[e4  first is far better]
;W[ad]C[white should play b18.];B[bc]C[B18 gives black a good shape.]
;W[ac];B[ab];W[ae];B[ba];W[cb];B[ca];W[ea]C[Black group is alive. White move has no effect on black group.
Black should take this opportunity to play elsewhere.];B[da]
;W[fa];B[hb]C[There are 2 more urgent moves  for black to play :  r14 , e4

The problem of h18 move is that it has no effect on f17 white group.
So it ables white to take the sente.];W[bj]C[Once again, white play a move wich is not urgent.
white c13 group looks solid, and black  c6 group is safe too.

White should play in the areas where he is in danger : r14 for example.]
;B[cj];W[bk];B[bl];W[cl]C[white c8 is overplay.
the 3  last white moves help black to strenghten his position .]
;B[dl];W[cm];B[bm];W[ci];B[dj]C[D10  gives black stones a bad shape.
Blach should play d9 or e9.];W[di]C[Black bad shape gives white forcing moves which ables him to make teritory.]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[fi]C[Too dangerous, black cannot hane.];W[fj]
;B[fk]C[Black should play e8 .
Black f9 helps white to capture f11, and didn't solve the problem of white e9 , black d9, white d7....]
;W[gj];B[gk];W[hj];B[he]C[Black should play e8 .];W[hd];B[id]
;W[ge];B[hf];W[ek]C[Now black is in real big trouble.
Black has to solutions :  1) play d7 to save c5 stones.
2)play d9 and save d9 stones.

I would prefer to save c5 stones.];B[dk];W[dm];B[el];W[em];B[en]
;W[fl];B[ek];W[gl];B[hk];W[ik];B[fm]C[It's better to wait for a ko to play this move.
Black should play g6.

Even if the black stones are taken by a ladder, the situation may change in the future.

Black may have the opportunity to play a ladder breaker later. ( around  n4 for example).]
;W[hl];B[cn]C[black c6 is very slow. It only save the 2 black stones at b7.
It's better to play at e4 or f4];W[ao]C[This move only helps black group to make 2 eyes.
F4 is the best move for white.
It makes territory , and keeps pressure
on black group which have only one eye . ( if black play a6, then white play a8 and there's only one eye)]
;B[an];W[ap];B[fp];W[fn]C[black f7 stone has no importance.
White should play elsewhere .  it only helps black to play f5 !]
;B[fo];W[gm];B[dq];W[eq]C[white cannot save this stone.
white should play d2 and then b2 to live in the corner.];B[dr]
;W[ep];B[fq];W[er];B[cr];W[br];B[bs];W[ds];B[bq];W[am];B[ar]
;W[fr];B[hr]C[h3 is better.];W[gq];B[eo]C[Black should cut at g2]
;W[gr];B[hq];W[gp];B[hp];W[go];B[lq];W[nq];B[oq];W[or];B[pr]
;W[op];B[os]C[Black p1 is a mistake.
Black must connect at q3];W[pq];B[nr]C[q3 is better for black.]
;W[oq];B[mr];W[jp];B[jo];W[io];B[jq];W[kp];B[lp];W[kq];B[kr]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[jr];B[ko];W[ho];B[mo]C[black should play r2]
;W[ir];B[hs];W[gs];B[jq];W[po];B[qp]C[Black cannot save this stone.
Black should let the situation and play at r14];W[qr];B[ps]
;W[qs];B[ns];W[qq];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[qm];B[rq];W[rn];B[ro]
;W[so];B[rp];W[rl];B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[rr];B[pc]C[r14 is better]
;W[qc];B[oc];W[od];B[nd];W[of];B[qb];W[rc];B[pj];W[oj]C[White shouldn't play at the contact of q10.
Contact moves are defensive moves.
Q12 is better.];B[ph];W[oh]C[white cannot capture the 2 black stones this way.]
;B[oi];W[ni];B[pi];W[pg];B[nj];W[nh];B[ok];W[mm];B[nm]C[M10 looks better, and more natural]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[nl];B[om];W[pm];B[ol];W[ll];B[nk];W[ml];B[lj]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[qi];B[qj];W[qh];B[qg]C[Black should play l11 to try to connect his stones to k16 group.]
;W[rg];B[qf];W[rf];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[qd]C[White is leading now  by 15-20 points. I think it was not possible for black , in this situation,  to win this game .
Black still have a group in danger ( o10).
It was quite reasonnable for black to resign.])
