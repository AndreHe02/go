C[Black: LadyNANA (20k* IGS)
White: Echelar (19k IGS) (me)

Komi: 0.5

Result: B+34.5

Echelar: Honestly, I think both of our real strengths are closer to 10 or 15k.. from my experience.. Anyways.. I don't feel that I made any obvious game-ending mistakes in this game. There were a few times I was caught off guard.. and a few moves that just surprised me. Here's the things I'd like a review to focus on:

1) Fuseki. I know I'm fairly weak in this area. Give me some pointers on how to build stronger groups and better territory...
2) Defense. This opponent was fairly aggressive, and I wasn't sure how to respond to a lot of his attacks. I made all my major groups live, which was good.. but he squeezed all my groups more than I would like.
3) Also, if you notice glaring mistakes in yose.. point those out too, please :)

Thanks in advance for reviewing my game, I know it takes time. I've been playing Go for about 4 months now, and I'm trying to learn from everyone I can :).

Well then... let's get to it.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]
;W[hq];B[cn]C[Echelar: This was moderately surprising, I'm used to people jumping towards the middle. Was there a better response to this black move?]
;W[fp]C[that seems like a fine move for the situation.  I don't know any common sequence for this, so I think this'll do.]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[Echelar: I didn't like doing this... since it makes my stones so overconcentrated.. However, I thought if I pushed him the other way, I wouldn't get any territory out of it.]
;B[cp]C[Yeah, here you've solidly split up there territory in the bottom left, so I think its a good result.]
;W[qo];B[do];W[ep];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fr];B[mq];W[ql];B[qp]

(;W[ro]C[Echelar: Maybe I should have done something more center-oriented here? Ideas?

Why not q5 then.  S5 is moving pretty low down.];B[po];W[pn]
;B[on];W[oo];B[pp];W[om];B[nn];W[pm];B[nm];W[dj];B[qh]C[Echelar: I get the feeling perhaps I should have played there first..

Depends on what you're aiming for.  Choosing between those moves depends more on your style of play and what you're looking to do as a whole in the game.  I would have gone with R14 instead, but D10 is just as good if you use it right.]
;W[rj];B[iq];W[jq];B[gq]C[Echelar: Didn't see this coming at all. I suppose the clamp was a bit aggressive, since I have a cutting point to protect. Shouldn't there be some way to gain strength for myself from his tsuke?

Hm... I think j4, insetad of k3, is what you're looking for.  It builds up more territory, and starts to threaten his.]

(;W[di]LB[di:A][ej:B]C[Echelar: I feel I lost out on the next 10 moves or so in a big way. I have an alternative idea in the variation.. I think it would have been a good idea, see if you agree.

Yeah, B does look like the move to make.  It works well with D16.]
;B[eh];W[dg];B[dh];W[ch];B[cg];W[cf];B[ci];W[bg];B[cj];W[jj]
C[Echelar: The intent was for this to be a ladder-breaker, plus a moyo reducer.. but perhaps there was a better move somewhere else?

I'm thinking along the lines of O10 to bust up his moyo, because those two stones are kinda out in the open.  Another option would be to play around k16, so when you do do that you have at least somewhere to run to ^^.]
;B[dc]C[Echelar: This also surprised me. Is there a way to push this stone into the corner and kill it? Or should I have just hane'd the other way?

I'm pretty sure that if your opponent plays right, then you can't kill it.  Just play at c17.]

;B[mc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[rd];B[re];W[sd]
TR[nb][oc]C[Echelar: Is there a way to kill my corner group here? Black was more worried about the cut apparently, but I thought that a 3-3 invasion could be killed if black could double hane around it. (hanes marked)

No I think that sequence leaves to a live shape if you play it right.]

;B[lh];W[kd]C[Echelar: Thankfully, I got to this point first. I can't imagine how many points he would have had if he would have beaten me to it..

Yeah that's a good move.  Had me worried there for a sec :)]
;B[gf];W[ki];B[li];W[lj];B[hi];W[jh]C[I don't think you need to make that move, you shoudl try for something bigger or in sente.]

Echelar: Games like this are fun, I enjoy losing to an opponent whose skill obviously demands his victory. Once again, thanks for the review!

Hope I helped some, it was fun reviewing it!])
