C[Dear reviewer,
hello and thank you very much for your help!
I will be thankful for any comments and suggestions about my game.

Rib: this doesn't seem bad hence o3 is very big, but i added a variation for k3. k3 just requires a little different strategy]

Any advices to improve?

Rib:it's hard to say by this game what to improve as there were a lot of good moves. But those small details make difference in the long run. In fuseki you only need 1 slow move to lose the advantage you've gained in the past moves. mid game a lot of reading, unless you're leading as you were in this game you can just secure your groups (also this should be done as well as possible). end game this is the easiest part of the game as you can just count the largest move and know some endgame tesujis.

Rib:  hopefully I found all mistakes I could find (it's pretty late here so can't really be sure)]
