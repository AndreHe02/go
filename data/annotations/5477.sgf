;B[qd];W[pp];B[dp]C[CG: According to my database of pro games, this is a rather unusual fuseki. This does not mean it is necessarily bad, but the pros don't seem to like it. The usual choice for a diagonal fuseki is C4.]
;W[cd];B[ed]C[CG: This is the correct direction - the approach moves on the upper side are the most urgent points.]
;W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[gd];W[cg]LB[ce:A][bf:B]C[CG: This is an over-extension. It may look bigger than the usual C14, but since it leaves weaknesses at A and B, the territory is actually smaller.]
;B[kc];W[od]
(;B[oc]C[CG: This looks dubious. Since black has already a stone at L17, I would rather play at Q14 (see variation). P17 adds a stone on the upper side where you are already strong.]
;W[nc];B[pc]
(;W[nd]C[CG: This is too heavy. White must play a light move like M15 since black is strong here.]
;B[qf];W[qj]C[CG: Overplay.];B[ng]C[Ben: I feel white needs to be punished in top right but I'm not sure this is the move to do it... suggestions? Would L15 be better? worse?

CG: L15 would have been much better. Since you can't expect to capture white, you should try to take profit while attacking. 
L15 strengthens your upper side and pushes white against your strong position in the upper right.
O13 makes it more difficult to take profit from attacking the white group.]
;W[kd]C[CG: This is a natural reply.]
(;B[jc]C[CG: Have you read that M16 does not work? It does not work here (see variation), but it should be your first impulse to play there.
It is very painful to have to play a submissive move here, and that is one of the reasons L15 would have been better.]
;W[lc];B[jd];W[ke];B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[cn];B[fq];W[bp];B[cq]
;W[og]C[CG: Overplay again.]
(;B[cl]C[BL: This move turns out to make a loss rather than a profit... is this first move the problem, or something in the followup (which is a bit odd-looking) ?

CG: First of all, I cannot understand you play tenuki in the upper right! This makes O13 a wasted move. You should welcome the fight and cut (see variation).
But concerning the lower left, C8 is the correct move.];W[cj]
;B[el];W[en];B[bq]TR[cl][el]SQ[cn][en][bp]C[CG: Wrong direction! E10 is the crucial point here. Adding a stone to your already strong corner secures some points, but it ignores the balance between the two fighting groups!]

(;W[dl]C[CG: This is also bad. White should just play E10.]
;B[dm];W[dk]
(;B[dn]LB[cm:B][dn:A]C[CG: This is the worst move so far! You _must_ play C7!]

(;W[bl]C[CG: White must cut at C7 since black can't resist.]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[bn];W[co]
(;B[bk];W[bo]
(;B[do]C[CG: If you intend to connect here, do so without exchanging B9 for B5. Once you played the exchange, it's better to connect at C9 and aim at destroying white's left side territory (see variation).

Please take also a look at the variation at black 47 to see how big the difference is! You have completely wasted a move!]
;W[ck];B[jq]TR[fq][nq]C[BL: Considered o5 instead of this move. looking back, I wish I'd played k4. Your thoughts?

CG: I still think P14 is the most urgent move on the board. Locally, I would play K4 - your position is just too low now.]
;W[no];B[qq]C[CG: K5 looks bigger.];W[jo]
(;B[lo]C[BL: This sequence also doesn't go well for me... was it possible to cut off K5 from RHS?

CG: If you want to attack K5, attach at N5. By attaching to the strong stone, you build up strength and keep white separated.]
;W[ln];B[mo]LB[kn:B][mo:A];W[np];B[lq];W[mn];B[nn]C[CG: This cut is hopeless.]
;W[ko];B[mq];W[nm];B[of]C[CG: Finally ...
Since white is clearly ahead, you must try something.];W[nf]

(;B[mf]C[CG: This a mistake in order ...];W[ne];B[pg];W[mg]
;B[oh];W[lg]C[CG: ... as your stone gets assimilated.];B[ok]
;W[pk];B[oj];W[ol];B[fg];W[gk];B[cf]C[Ben: Again, a loss-making move in the game. What would be your move locally?And which area of the board is most urgent at this point? Hereish, r11ish, s5ish,e7ish, somewhere else completely?

CG: A do-or-die move like this is ok. Personally, I would already consider to resign. Just playing "normal" endgame moves does not work.]
;W[df]
(;B[dg]C[CG: C15 looks more resourceful. It looks as if black could live along the side.]
;W[ef];B[ch];W[bg];B[bh];W[dh];B[eg];W[bf]
(;B[bj]C[CG: This does not work. D11 is the only move.];W[di]
