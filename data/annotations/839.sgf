C[[
DJ\] In this game I (Thangalin) played White (8 kyu) against Azare (4 -5
kyu when not drunk).];B[pd];W[cq];B[pq];W[ed]C[DS:  In this case consider
what was your plan if black just continued on the right?]
(;B[cd]C[[DJ\] I would really like to see some joseki for this position.
I was thinking about E17 and D14.

DS:  The basic question is what does white want to do here?]

(;W[ce]
(;B[dd]C[DS:  An unorthodox play when black does not have a pincer around
H16 in support.];W[de];B[ec]C[DS:  White's next at E15 had a definite goal
in mind.  That is good.  In my opinion playing with a plan is one of the
main prerequisites for improving and also enjoying the game.  At the same
time, in positions like this you should feel an almost unbearable urge to
make the double hane - variation 2.]
(;W[ee];B[fc];W[dj]C[[DJ\] I was satisfied with this result.  I got D10
which, I think, is an optimal extension (please correct me if I should have
played closer to C3).

DS:  Where to play on the left is a tough question. Two issues here:
1. Black's hane and connection at B15 are very big and almost certain to be
sente.
2. The 3-3 point is inherently low and it is difficult to extend from or to
it.   
Overall white is not that good here - black's corner is large and how can
white develop efficiently from his 3-3 point?]
(;B[dp]C[DS:  This is a bit rushed.  As it turns out, black becomes a
target for attack.  I think that it would be interesting to play elsewhere,
developing black's position and wait to see how white tries to develop.
Usually the 4-4 shoulder hit is held back until white has played on both
sides (e.g. extended to K4).];W[cp]C[DS: Black jumped to D6 next - var. 1
but in this case I think simply D5 was better - var. 2.]
(;B[dn]C[[DJ\] I was not familiar with this joseki, and thought about B6,
but didn't want to give black a big moyo if he played D3.

DS:  See var. 2 and 3 for the usual responses here.]
(;W[er];B[co];W[cm]C[[DJ\] Vital point?

DS: One of the vital points in this shape.  The real issue is whether black
should respond to it or not.  These stones are not worth a lot.  Black has
not developed enough on the right or elsewhere.  Really black should play
elsewhere which means that white should have also, waiting to attack these
stones later, hopefully on a larger scale.];B[bo]C[DS: a heavy
move];W[fp]C[[DJ\] Mistake.  D7 better than F4?

DS: No F4 is the right direction.  Making a D7 C7 pillar leaves D10
over-concentrated - in response black jumps to G5 and is half way
home.];B[cl]C[DS: A nice play

White over reacts and black gets a good result here. It seems that about
the best white can do is B8 - var. 2  White has to turn aside and see
whether an opportunity will arise later to return to these stones.  In the
game black lives absolutely - there is not a bit of aji left.]

C[DS: Mistake in direction,
giving white the chance to get back into the game.];W[ch];B[ai]
;W[bd]C[DS:
A good choice - this point is more important on the left side than B12
was.];B[bc];W[be];B[ci];W[dh];B[di];W[ei];B[eh]C[DS: Not possible, black must connect before
cutting.];W[bi];B[ci];W[di]C[[DJ\] An obvious error.  Where should I play
instead of D11?  I thought K3 or O17, but maybe H15 better?

DS:  Realize that there is not too much scope to expand from white's wall
due the presence of K16 and E6.  As a result, H15 looks like a thank you
move - black is happy to react and close off the gap in his position.  O17
looks like the right area and it is better to do it now than after black
plays G15.];B[ge]C[DS: As mentioned this is small because neither side
has much chance here.  The real issue is the upper right corner.  Black
should play there.];W[nc]C[DS:  White gets in first.

The usual idea fpr black next would be to play against the strong stone at
Q14 in order to surround O17 on a large scale - var. 2]
(;B[nd];W[md];B[oc]C[DS:  This seems too easy on
white.];W[ne];B[od];W[mc]C[DS:  White is living dangerously with this move
- black is very strong on the left.  Connecting on top looks much more
reasonable.];B[me];W[nf]C[DS:  What if black extends next var. 2?]

(;B[pf];W[le];B[qg];W[qc]C[[DJ\] Can R17 be played to live unconditionally
(no ko for life?), given the stone at R14 and O17?

DS:  Let's take a closer look...
Personally I think that white is dead if black answers at R16 (instead of
R15 as in the game) - see var. 2]
(;B[qe];W[pb]C[DS: A reasonable looking start.];B[ob]
(;W[rb]C[[DJ\] Mistake?

DS: Yes];B[rd];W[rc];B[qa];W[pa];B[ra]C[[DJ\] The corner should be dead,
but black let me have Ko.

DS: Yes, this is dead but no there was actually no ko (see below). Black
let you have unconditional life.];W[sa];B[sb];W[sc];B[sa];W[qb]
;B[ra];W[sa];B[sb]C[DS: Now what happens if white plays R19?  This type of shape
is only ko when white has been reduced to only one outside liberty (and
therefore can not play at R19).];W[qd];B[rf];W[sa]C[[DJ\] The Ko is good
for Black, yes?

DS: As long as white is taken in by the illusion it is great for black
:-)];B[dq];W[dr];B[qj];W[jq];B[hp];W[go]C[DS: This looks unreasonable in
the face of black's stone at E6];B[iq]C[DS: Probably K4 is more reasonable here.]
;W[jp];B[ho]C[DS: What if
white plays hane at H6 - var 2?]
(;W[gn];B[hn];W[gm];B[hm];W[jn]C[[DJ\] K6 a mistake?  I think I had to
play N14.

DS: K6 looks necessary.  Otherwise the white stones here may being captured
outright by L5 or something
similar.];B[gq];W[fq];B[hl];W[mf];B[gl];W[fm]C[[DJ\] Didn't like playing
F7, but felt I had no choice.

DS: Keeping this connection means that neither the stones in lower left nor
the stones on the left side can get into trouble.  F7 has a positive side
but you did not realize it I think and played too passively soon after.]
;B[em];W[fl];B[gj];W[fh]C[DS: This is a bad move, I think.  There is no need for
it precisely because the earlier F7 kept your stones connected.  N5 instead
(or O4, black O3, M5?) would now connect your right side to the bottom,
helping your remaining weak groups.];B[lo]C[DS: This
hurts];W[jl];B[ij];W[ll]C[[DJ\] Didn't like playing M8 either, as I wanted
to attack H5 group but didn't know how ...

DS: I think M8 is a dangerous play for white.  It leaves behind some bad
aji. L9 instead gives white better shape and pushes black toward the
top,];B[mm]C[DS: A shot but black doesn't realize it.];W[ml]
C[DS:  What
happens now if black plays the sequence in var 2 cutting white apart?  N7
is in just the right place to make the cut possible.]
(;B[nl];W[pk];B[nm];W[pj];B[qi];W[lm]C[DS: White protects against the
cut.];B[ko];W[jo];B[kn];W[jm]C[DS: In this situation L7 is better.  Black
J7 is a meaningless poke and white gains the possibility to play L9 to make
an eye later.];B[kj]C[DS:  O10 keeping white split would be better.  If
white jumps out at L10, black can connect the center group to the top while
chasing white before turning back to attack the right side white
stones.];W[mj];B[lh];W[nh];B[rl];W[jf]C[[DJ\] I like K14, but he got out ... There
should have been a way to seal him in -- any
