would think something in the neighborhood of L17 would have been more
productive.];B[gc];W[gg]C[Considering how the game ends,
with the group at D12 dying, G13 is nice, but I'd still like to work on
the G17 group by playing between that and the P16
group.];B[pd];W[pb]C[Considering the outcome of this
corner, I think Q18 was a major mistake. R18 would have left you in a
stronger

plays there white takes back immediately and black still has no eye.  I
would have played J17 to pressure G17 group or invaded near H3 or
N3.];B[fd];W[ef]C[Since you end up killing the group at
left, I suppose this move can be defended, but I would have played G15
to keep the G17 group
confined.];B[ge];W[gf];B[hf];W[hg];B[if];W[ig];B[ke];W[je]C[M15
