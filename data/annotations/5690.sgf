Hi, my name is Evan. In this game, I am Merridock.];B[pp]C[Merridock [21k\]: hi]
;W[de];B[cp];W[pd];B[ec]
(;W[dd]C[My first question is wether or not 6 was a good move. Was it to passive, or did it give away to much ground?

Sarge: At this point it seems too slow, it doesnt secure the corner or build much eye space on the left side. The standard joseki move is at c17]
;B[fe]
(;W[fd]C[And 8 as well. Perhaps I should hve cut at E 16 instead of F16?

Sarge: It would probably be better to either expand your left territory and get some eye space and/or attacked from the right side]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[gd];W[fc];B[fb];W[dc];B[eb];W[ff];B[ge];W[gg]
;B[gf]
(;W[ef];B[hg];W[gh];B[hh];W[hf];B[fq];W[gc]C[Sarge: This group is already dead, no reason to add to it]
;B[hc];W[if];B[he];W[hi];B[ig];W[jg];B[ie];W[ih];B[je]
(;W[kf]C[Sarge: I think there are better places for this move, the black group is alive, so work on containing it, attacking somewhere else, or using the giant wall you have built up to the left]
;B[db];W[cb]C[Can you think of a way to escape the ladder?

Sarge: Not sure exactly what you are referring to];B[cc];W[bc]
;B[bb];W[cd];B[ca]
(;W[ab];B[cc];W[bd];B[cb];W[ac];B[aa]
(;W[ba]C[Sarge: This is a 1 point ko with no group life depending on it, not worth it]
;B[dj]
(;W[dk]C[Sarge: Contact moves make both groups stronger. This is his single stone attacking into your territory with your huge wall. you dont need to be stronger, contact moves only work in his favor]
;B[ek];W[ck];B[cj]
(;W[ej];B[ei];W[fj];B[fi];W[gj];B[fg]
(;W[fh];B[eg];W[eh];B[dg]C[Sarge: You are pushing him into your eye space and making life dangerous for you own c16 group]
;W[di];B[bj];W[ci];B[ch];W[cf];B[bi];W[gi];B[dh];W[ei];B[bg]
;W[cg];B[bf];W[be];B[bk];W[el];B[cl];W[dl];B[cm];W[ae];B[af]
;W[df];B[bh]C[Sarge: By playing too many contact moves and allowing him to create eye space and destroy your own, he has now destroyed all of your territory on the left]

(;W[gl]C[Sarge: you are playing too close to your wall. Use your strength to attack]
;B[fm]
(;W[fl]C[Sarge: same. there is no need to block here];B[gm]
;W[hm];B[em];W[dm]C[Sarge: again, a very small move, there are too many big moves left to be playing this]
;B[dn]
(;W[hn]C[Sarge: Good idea, but too slow, play lower];B[jp]C[Sarge: he now has the whole bottom secured]
;W[jo];B[io];W[in];B[ho];W[go];B[gp];W[hp]C[I noticed about here that my opponent doesn't make very many connections. I think that connections are VERY important but should I really put so much emphasis on them?

Sarge: Connections are very important, but you think about them in the wrong way. Early game, your stones dont need to be directly connected and you dont need to worry so much. You want to think more about how they will be connected later, what the possibilities are for cutting and connections, basically good shape, more than good connections. Later in close fighting, connections become important. Your opponent may have weaker groups, but you only have one heavy group in the center with no territory, while he has light agile groups taking up all the territory around it]
;B[ip];W[hq];B[fo];W[gn];B[fn];W[kp];B[jq];W[gr]C[The next couple of moves bring the cluster to Life and Death. What could I have done differently?

Sarge: it seems after k3 that your group is pretty dead];B[fr]

(;W[fs];B[es];W[gs];B[ir]
(;W[jr];B[kr];W[iq];B[kq]C[Sarge: It is important to read ahead and see if you can find a way to live. If you cant, struggling pointlessly can hurt you, as now he has L2 and L3, and you have gained nothing]
;W[is];B[js];W[jn];B[gq];W[ke];B[kd]
(;W[jd]C[128 was a bad move from the start, but the idea was to maybe capture the cross shaped cluster.

Sarge: again, trying for something you can't get can often hurt you. here the group is already weak, but instead of trying to capture it, use that weakness to reduce its territory]
;B[id];W[jc];B[ib];W[ic];B[kc];W[jb];B[ja];W[jf];B[kb]
(;W[ld];B[lc];W[md];B[mc];W[oc];B[nc];W[nd];B[ob];W[pb];B[oa]
;W[pa];B[qc];W[nb]C[Sarge: good catch];B[ma];W[na];B[mb];W[qd]
;B[pc];W[rc];B[od];W[oe];B[mf]
(;W[mg]C[Sarge: remember that contact move strengthens everyone. Just make sure he has no eye space and you will be fine. The n14 stone wasnt very threatening to begin with since it was almost surrounded on three sides by your stones. Play somewhere else]
;B[lg]C[Sarge: he still has no eye space. dont bother cutting]

(;W[lf];B[le];W[me];B[nf]

;B[kj];W[kh]C[Sarge: this is a much better move than the other. Goes right for the eyespace]
