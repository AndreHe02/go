;B[pd]C[niklaus: Hi Art, I hope my comments are in some way helpful to you. However, keep in mind that I am just a 4 kyu myself so they are not to be taken as absolute truth. If you've got more questions feel free to email me.]

niklaus: pulling back works too (see variation), but this move seems good to me too, however the continuation was less than optimal]

(;B[be]C[niklaus: I would definitely cut (see variation)];W[cf]
;B[ch]C[niklaus: this move I find very strange. You could still cut at d15, because the ladder works for black. If you don't cut, you better take care of your corner with b14, because white will enter the "territorry" you make with c12 later anyway, as seen in the game.]
;W[bf];B[ae];W[de];B[af]LB[ag:B][bg:A]C[niklaus: another strange move. It doesn't help black live]

(;B[mh]C[niklaus: very small move. And the result of it is strengthening white's center group. You'd better aim at attacking the whole group while enlarging your territorry.]
;W[mg]LB[ng:B][mi:A]
(;B[mi];W[lg];B[bq]LB[dp:A][kr:B]C[niklaus: too early. There are still weak groups around, such as white in the center, and black in the lower right. So you should either attack one or defend the other.]

(;B[ci]C[maybe c11 was too small

niklaus: c11 is not that small, but the problem is that it is gote. There are still a couple of sente moves left which are at least as big.]
;W[kd];B[jf]LB[lc:B][md:A]C[niklaus: uuh, this looks like a bad idea to me... it's true, you're behind (by around 20 points) and if you want to win, you have to take some risks, but this seems to be the wrong place to do it... you're putting your biggest territorry in real danger here... why not just solidly connect at l17 first and see what you can do later? Because there is no real chance of doing more damage to white that he does to black here.]

(;W[md];B[ji]C[niklaus: this looks like utter desperation to me :) Ignoring that last white move is very damaging to the territorry on top.]

;W[ar];B[pr];W[rs]C[niklaus: What I have seen several time in this game is that you make move which are sente allright, but the exchange doesn't gain you anything at all, in some cases even being better for your opponent. This is a very bad habit which you should try to get rid of. Before every move think about if it actually gains you something. If not, leave it for later. Either a ko will come up and you can use it as a threat, or the surrounding situation chances and the move which was useless before suddenly becomes the centrepiece of a beautiful combination :) If you play sente moves as soon as you see them, without considering if they are useful, you ruin yourself a lot of possibilities (aji keshi)

I hope this review was useful for you and answered your questions. If not, feel free to email me.]
