I'm Black.

kds2207 seemed to value
the center very much. (We played
one game just before this one.
I lost by a small margin.) So I
kept that in mind.

Dieter Verhofstadt:

Hi. My comments will follow the initials dv.

I think your strong point is your reading skills, especially your knowledge of Life and death. You know quite early whether a group will die and who is ahead in a fight, liberty-wise. From your name I assume you are Korean. I guess you have done some L&D problem solving. I know many players with a nice technique who can't read half as well as you.

Accordingly, your weak point is that you try to save almost every stone you have, whatever its meaning is. So that I would call your area of improvement: learn which stones are important in a game, sacrifice the useless stones and do so with the greatest possible benefit. I will try to focus on that while answering your questions.]
;B[op]C[So this move. :-)];W[de];B[od];W[of]LB[qd:A]C[Esoteric, isn't it?

dv: Esoteric, yes. If you make a simple shimari at A, his stone becomes oddly placed. You can also skip to the other corner because right now you are the one controlling the upper right.]
;B[qf]LB[qd:B][pe:A]C[dv: The "hazama tobi" leaves an obvious cutting point at A. When you play this, you must have calculated in advance what happens if White plays the obvious move. If you're happy with that, then this is OK. If you play without calculating, then it is better to stick with ordinary moves such as "ikken tobi" at B.]
;W[pe]
(;B[qd]C[dv: Usually, permitting the cut of the hazama tobi has the intention of sacrificing one stone. See variation.]
;W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[re]C[dv: You have four cutting points. That's not the way to play with the hazama tobi.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rf];B[rc];W[se]C[dv: If you compare this result with my variation earlier, you lose two stones instead of one and you are one line lower. Clearly this result is favorable for White, taking into account he started with an odd approach move at P14.]
;B[qj]LB[dp:A]C[I thought this sequence was
a joseki, but I may be confused.
After all, it's not very common
sequence.

If I did something wrong here,
what is the optimal sequence for
each player?

dv: As you may understand from my comments, this was not joseki at all. As for the current move, it is way too close to the opponent's strong group (thickness). Instead, taking the empty corner is called for.]
;W[oj]LB[qp:A]C[dv: White too is playing too close to his strength. Attacking your stone at A or taking the empty corner would be logical.]
;B[ok]LB[pl:A]C[P4-R10 is one of my favorite
setup. :-)

dv: On an empty board in the opening, it may have its merits, but here the value of R10 is greatly reduced by the nearby White strength. Conventional technique is to answer the capping play at A instead.]
;W[nk];B[pk];W[nl];B[qo];W[on];B[pm]C[dv: This last 2 moves exchange was clearly favorable for Black: you connect to make territory on the 4th line, while White's stone is not accomplishing much. He should have kept this in reserve.

The game now clearly becomes a territory-influence contest. For the moment, chances are more or less equal again, but I prefer your position, because you have already the territory.]
;W[mo];B[dp]C[dv: Yes, taking the empty corner is very big.]
;W[en]C[...Who can stop this guy? :-)];B[jd];W[jf]C[dv: A note on White's "central influence style". Influence and central moyos, such as Takemiya's, are supposed to come through natural exchanges. If you just stake out a central moyo, without simultaneously pressing your opponent's position, his corners and sides will be big and safe and he will have hands free to reduce your center.]
;B[jo];W[jm]C[dv: Here, White is surrounding central territory on the 6th and 7th line. That will be good for 42 points. He can have that. White is not severe enough.]
;B[dj];W[fj]C[Amusing. Really.

dv: Amusing and probably suicidal, if he doesn't start using his influence to attack any time soon.]
;B[dg];W[eh];B[eg];W[fg];B[dh];W[ei];B[ee];W[ed];B[dd]C[Let's fight!]
;W[ce];B[dc];W[fd];B[ff];W[gg]
(;B[gf]C[dv: I think it is better to strengthen the corner stones. Then you will end up by capturing at least one of the two White strings. See var.]
;W[hf];B[hd];W[eb];B[bd];W[cd];B[cc];W[be];B[bb];W[ad];B[bc]

(;W[db]C[too early, see var];B[bf]C[White is captured. Right?

dv: Yes];W[gd];B[hc]C[dv: good move];W[he];B[ge];W[di];B[ci]
;W[cj];B[bi];W[bj]C[Kinda finished here.
But...];B[dk]C[Now I think this one was
an overplay.

dv: well, in the upper left there is nothing White can do:]

(;W[cl]C[dv: Even if these cutting stones get captured, their potential (aji) will be useful. I don't consider D9 an overplay.]
;B[fk]C[dv: But drawing them out immediately seems premature.]
;W[dl];B[gj];W[gi];B[ej];W[fi];B[hk]LB[fp:A]C[dv: Every move you add in his central moyo can be an extra prisoner, while White fortifies the outside. 

Let's count:

Black: top left (55), top right (5/10), bottom right (25), total of about 85 points.

White: his center can become at most 70 points, even if he captures your stones. Therefor it is better to develop the stone in the lower left. If he has a chance to cut your lower side with an approach move at A, the game can become very difficlut.]
;W[gm];B[hi];W[hh];B[gh];W[fh];B[ig]C[Why I did this? Oops.]
;W[ih];B[ii];W[jg];B[ie];W[if];B[el];W[gl];B[gk];W[em];B[il]
;W[in];B[jl];W[ji];B[ij];W[kl];B[jk]C[Now Black is alive. But...

dv: Yes, this is a huge unexpected success. White shouldn't have let this happen, and in fact you shouldn't have tried, because the fight was really White's. Still, the lower side is now extremely vulnerable.]
;W[fp]C[Bottom side became weak.];B[cn];W[ck];B[ek];W[bn];B[bo]
;W[bm];B[co];W[mq]C[White didn't connect.
I don't know why.

dv: And why didn't you cut ?];B[km];W[ll];B[hn];W[io];B[hq]
;W[fq];B[er];W[eq];B[dq];W[fr];B[ip];W[ho];B[lq]LB[md:A][dm:C]
[or:B]C[Struggle for life.

dv: Here you show a desire to live everywhere and give our opponent nothing. That's not realistic and it is wrong too. White can have the bottom if you can  do two of the following three things: make more territory at the top (A), the bottom (B) or kill the left side (C).]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[lp];B[kq];W[mr];B[ir]C[According to my reading,
Black is alive now. But...

dv: let's see]
(;W[pq]C[Corner became weak.

...This is an repeating pattern.
After I treat somewhere, the other
part of the board becomes weak.
Perhaps all these are sin of
D9 (overplay).

dv: D9 is not such an overplay. but both attempts to live were.]
;B[dm]C[Now I cut! What will happen?

Note that this seems to threat
the White group on the bottom
side also. I don't know exactly how,
but it seems vulnerable.

dv: Not as long as he has D2.];W[im];B[hp];W[go];B[gr];W[dr]
;B[cr];W[es]C[White secures his group.];B[np];W[mp];B[qq]C[It seems I misread here.

What should be a proper play?

dv: The play is good. The corner territory is more important than the two Black stones. Sacrifice them.]

;W[mf];B[qg]LB[me:B][rh:C][jj:A][oo:D]C[A long-awaited move.

dv: Really ? Trying to save a useless stone. That stone should have been sacrificed in your mind a long time ago.

Locally: C is better. A and B and D are other large moves.]
;W[ch]C[What's this? Is here something?];B[bh]C[Perhaps White's misreading.]

alive. Doesn't it?

dv: Yes.];W[fc]C[But White didn't.];B[fa]C[I think M19 is still a way to go.
Then... is it a ko?

dv:let's see]
(;W[ga];B[la]C[White group died.

dv: Good reading.];W[br]C[So White tries another fight.

Yes, White will live, but the simple
A4 was a way to go. Still it was
not bad for Black.];B[an]C[An overplay, it seems.];W[ap];B[bp]
