;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ed];B[cd]LB[cc:a]C[Nothing really wrong with this move but a stronger player probably would not rush to play it.  Depending on what happens on the outside it might turn out that 'a' is better.]
;W[cc];B[dd]LB[bc:a][dc:b]C[Definitely wrong. Hane at 'a' is the usual move.

With this shape it permits W to play at 'b' which is very good shape -- there is even a proverb which says to hane at the head of two stones.  In this shape W has played the hane (W4) before B has got to play his two stones, but the end shape is the same.]
;W[dc];B[ee];W[fd];B[df]C[This is not very  good for B.  W has got some nice territory and B's shape is not all that robust.]
;W[bd];B[cf]LB[be:a]C[B must block at 'a']
(;W[qj]LB[be:a][bc:b][ce:c]C[W should not leave the top corner unsettled. A single B move at make his group unattackable.  Not only that, if W connects at 'b' after 'a' then B does it in sente. Look at the variation starting at 'c'.

This move, an invasion of the side, should lead to a lot of small groups and fighting]
;B[nd]LB[lc:a][mc:b][jp:c][fq:d][ql:e]C[This is not a good move. B leaves himself open at 'a', which allows W to make use of the top left to get a potential territory at the top.  If B is going to play in this direction he should play at 'b'.

However, I would be more inclined to play at the bottom. Playing at 'c' makes miai of 'd' and 'e' and B has a better game.]
;W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[pl];B[jq]LB[qk:a]C[This whole exchange leaves W overconcentrated.  In the usualy joseki W has one stone at 'a'.  To play two stones (W14 and W20) instead this earlier in the game lose out.

However, this does show B15 to be bad because the B shape, being high, is played for influence.  W has effetively nullified that influence so it cannot be said to be bad.]
;W[qf]LB[lc:a]C[This is the wrong side.  W is strong on the left so he should not add stones to it. Approaching from 'a' has more potential]
;B[jc];W[hc];B[je];W[cn];B[dj]LB[gf:a][cl:b][gq:c][el:d]C[This move was pretty much meaningless. B can make no territory on the left as he is open both above and below.  Any move in this area has to be aimed at influence of central territory. Both of these aims can be immediately nnullified by Wa.

Playing at 'b' would be better - at least it would block of the side from below.  If W answers 'b' with 'c' then B can play 'd']
;W[gq];B[rd]LB[jo:a]C[An excellent point.  However, it is gote.  An alternative approach would be to play at 'a'.]
;W[of];B[mf]LB[jo:a]C[Too small. Now that B has secured to top it is better to turn attention to the bottom. 'a' is a nice point.]
;W[lc]C[This move violates all rules of invading.  There is no way this can live and it is like giving B a free point and a free move.]
;B[mb]LB[ic:a][jb:b]C[This seems extremely cowardly. B is playing inside his own territory! 'a' is nice shape. Wth this shape W is left with 'b' to aim for.]
;W[nh];B[lh];W[he]LB[jo:a]C[The last three moves where all off target.  'a' is biggest]
;B[gf]LB[be:a]C[If B is going to play from his top left group he must play 'a']
;W[hf];B[gg];W[dl];B[cq]LB[dq:a]C[B can get at least a ko by invading.  See the variation starting with W 'a'.  Living unconditionally is not so easy once W has reenforced with W40]

(;W[dq];B[bp]LB[jo:a]C[Because W40 is on the board the threat to escape if much reduced.  This makes it much harder for B to live.  Probably the best approach is to leave the corner alone for a while.  B can get a ko with the variation shown earlier as long as W is not too strong on the outside.  Playing 'a' with the intent of coming back later is a good approach.  If W takes a move to stop the B ko then B gains a move elsewhere.]

C[Unnecessary];B[gk]LB[hp:a]C[Now that W has a solid wall B should try to compress the W territory in front of it by playing at 'a'.]

(;B[lp]LB[kp:a]C[In this position the correct move is often 'a'.  W cannot get out and has to try to live on the edge.  This is often not possible.  See the variation.]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[mo]LB[kp:a][lr:b]C[Playin atari at 'a' and then connecting is very big, cutting off B21.  If B prevents this by connecting under at 'b' the ponnuki is even bigger]
;B[kq];W[lr]LB[nq:a][op:b]C[This is a case were the proverb of sacrificing two does not work.  W already missed the chance to cut off B21.  Now the best is to play 'a' and then 'b'.  This should capture the corner if B tries to save B17]
;B[mr];W[lo];B[kp];W[jb];B[fm]LB[mj:a][nm:b]C[This move does very little.  Playing so close to a strong W wall does not make sense unless it also secures territory.  This move does not do that.  B should play  'a'.  This move both expands B territory while reducing W territory.  It also threatens 'c']
