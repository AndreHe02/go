C[Hello reviewer I play black in this game.
I loose by 1.5
I always have the same problem i can't avoid the opponent to invade my moyo and can't get any compensation for that.

It would also be great if you could show me my biggest mistakes and to tell my the points I should work and where I could improve.

Thanks in advance for the review

Gafagarion

Hi gafagarion,

This was a fun game for me to review, and I enjoyed reviewing it.  

It seems to me that you need to work a bit on your fighting and direction of play.  

When fighting, remember the following principles
1) Stay connected
2) Try to keep your opponent from connecting, 
3) Try to surround your opponent.

You took gote in the endgame too often, which is ultimately why you lost this game, despite your nice tesuji on the left.  It is extremely important to try to keep sente in endgame.  

Hope my review helps.  If you have any questions don't hesitate to email me.]

;B[cd];W[qp];B[ec];W[pj];B[ck]C[Didn't know if it was the right extension here.

NS:  C10 is typical.  A 5 line extension is often considered optimal for speed, because it can not be split comfortably.  O3 playable.]
;W[cg];B[cn];W[cp];B[df]C[I wanted to attack the weak stone in order to get moyo on the top

NS:  This move is too close.   It is more effective to attack from a distance.  C11, E14 look better to me.]
;W[cj];B[dj]C[NS:   A rule of thumb is that you should extend when touched, and you are stronger.  When your opponent is stronger, you should hane.  So if you were to follow that rule, you should extend here.]

(;B[en]TR[dk]C[Here i was afraid of D9 as G3 is a ladder breaker so i protected it

NS: I think this move a bit slow.  I'd play something around O3.

I don't think the cut would be too painful at this point.  If I were cut, I'd sacrifice D10 to make a very solid position.]
;W[ce];B[de];W[eg];B[gf];W[cf];B[qg];W[qm]C[This move was strange I think?
No?

NS:  I would have played P3. or P4.  He doesn't want to get split though]
;B[lq]TR[iq][oq]C[Is it the right invasion point?
I choose this because this 2 points were miai.
I was also thinking about headin for P3 but was too afraid

NS: M3 good.];W[jq];B[oq];W[qq];B[lo];W[nc]

C[here i was pretty happy and was clearly leading

NS:  I don't think you are clearly leading.  I count 54 for b, and 58 for w, though that doesn't take any consideration for the thickness at C9.]

NS: Yes, your moyo is destroyed, but you got something out of it, including a wall at M13, and a few center facing moves.  You missed the opportunity to attack the K14 group, and perhaps use your influence at C9.]
