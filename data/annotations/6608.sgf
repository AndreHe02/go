C[3rd round in the swedish championship.
I won the game but only because my opponent made a late game misstake.]
;B[co];W[pp];B[qd];W[cc];B[nq];W[kp];B[nn]C[Chris: This position is too thin. It has occured only twice in pro games, both times, the pincering side won. I have added their variations and what I would play in this position.]

;W[qp];B[iq]
(;W[jo]TR[nn][op][oq][nq][pq]LB[kp:A]C[Chris: This is not te right direction. Black does not have to worry at this very moment about the marked group. So moves here help black build up the lower left corner and side. The A stone should be regarded as light for the moment. It also canot be shut in directly. It would have been better to tenuki.]

;W[lp];B[on];W[po];B[nl]
(;W[pl];B[np];W[pj]C[Chris: This is greedy. There is no threat to the group on the right side. White should have made his centre group stronger, keeping blacks group weak.]

;B[mi];W[ki];B[nc]C[Chris: An overplay by black.];W[oe]C[The idea was a splitting attack, but not sure on the best point.
Chris: A very good idea! White has to lean on the shimari to attack the centre bulk.]
;B[qh]C[This feels like a misstake for black but I failed to capitalize on it.
Chris: Another overplay.];W[ph];B[oi];W[pi];B[mg];W[oc]C[Just playing R13 would have been enough?]
;B[qg]
(;W[og]C[Not very good I think, black can't connect here anyway so maybe O16 instead?

My whole attack dripped away here and I didn't get enough compensation. Feelt I lost the game here.]

(;W[of];B[md];W[lh];B[mh];W[ne]C[Aji keshi but I was trying to defend against black Q17 in sente.]
;B[me]
(;W[rd]C[Really bad. I was so desprate to try to get some compensation  that I didn't read before playing.

Should I just have taken sente here and play something on the left or top side instead?

What about S11, could that be considered sente before playing tenuki?]
;B[re];W[qe];B[rf];W[qc];B[pd]
(;W[pc];B[rj];W[rk]C[Chris: You should not force black to make eyes inside your terretory.]
;B[rc];W[od];B[sd];W[ri]C[Chris: If you cannot kill Black by taking this stone, it is only worth 4 points.]
;B[fd];W[hd];B[jc];W[jd]C[Better on J15?
Chris: This move is quite good, as it makes black overconcentrated. White has to think about how to strengthen the center group.]
;B[kd];W[ic]C[Chris: This is not good, as it makes white heavy and helps black split whites position. white has to play lighter than this.]

[ak][aj][ai][cg][ch][ci][cj][ck][cl][cm][cn]C[Chris: Since white connected his groups now, its ok. Now White has to think about how to reduce blacks moyo. It is important to note, that blacks only weakness is around A. It is very difficult to find a good invasion/reduction point. First we should count to see, how much of a reduction is necessary to win.

Black is leading by about 15 points. This means, white has to make around 20 points of terretory in the center. A really hard invasion is therefore not necessary.]

I think i had a nice attack going but somehow I completely failed to capatilize on it.

Then I made a really bad invasion and was only saved because of a misstake of my opponent.]
