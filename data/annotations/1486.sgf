C[Dear reviewer, thank you for taking time off to comment on my game. I took black.

;B[ch]LB[qe:a][pf:b][pi:c][fd:d]C[EE: Since white didn't finish the
top right, it is important to get sente to get back there and attack White's stone (with a-b-c or something similar). d seems likelier to end up in sente than the pincer you played, but it is probably okay.]
;W[ef];B[fd];W[di];B[ci];W[dj];B[cj];W[dk];B[dh];W[eh];B[ck]
LB[cl:a]C[EE: You want to jump ahead as soon as possible, so 'a' is the usual move here.]
;W[dl];B[cm];W[dm];B[cn];W[cp];B[dg]TR[ck][dl]C[EE: This can be a threat to the stones on the outside, but here they are strong, partly because
of the marked exchange. It would probably be better to attack the stone in the top right now.]
;W[cc]C[wild : I'm a little puzzled here. I felt that white has overplayed. How should I respond?

EE: I see nothing wrong in White's invasion.];B[cd];W[bd];B[be]
LB[dc:a]C[EE: This looks a bit too small in scale. Maybe you should block on the other side and take sente?]
;W[bc];B[bf];W[eb];B[eg]C[EE: Again, rather small in scale.]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[gc]C[EE: Black has a difficult game now.];B[eo]
;W[dn];B[do];W[co];B[ep];W[cl];B[bl];W[bo];B[bm];W[gn];B[dq]
;W[cq];B[dr];W[cr];B[hp]TR[dq][dr]C[wild : Does not look like good shape. This group got into trouble later in the game and was completely captured. How should I hae play the sequence here?

EE: You correctly regard the two marked stones as kikashi and sacrifice them.]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[eq]C[EE: White should play f3 instead. Taking two stones this way is small.]
;B[fq];W[er];B[fr];W[ds]C[EE: Good shape for Black at the bottom.]
;B[nq]LB[jq:a][lq:b][kq:c]C[wild : I thought black is in a better position than white. What do you think? Perhaps, it's more urgent to white R14 now instead of O3? Where would you have played?

EE: Yes Black get back in the game after the sequence at the bottom. But O3 feels overextended. A white play around 'a' would be irritating for Black.  So I think 'b' or 'c' is correct.]
;W[lq];B[no]LB[jq:a]C[EE: Maybe 'a' instead.];W[jq];B[ir]LB[iq:a]
C[wild : Again I question my shape here? Any better alternative?

EE: This looked okay at first sight, but since you end up without two eyes, perhaps you should try 'a' instead?]
;W[iq];B[hq];W[jr];B[hr]LB[dc:a]C[wild : I think I should have played G2 instead.

EE: To make a difference, you would have to fight the ko after White J1. You have some threats at the top starting with 'a', so it could be a possibility.]
;W[kn]LB[hn:a][fp:b]C[EE: Black's group is severely threatened. 'a' might combine ways of making 'b' an eye and running out.]
;B[pn];W[fo]C[wild : I should have given up 3 black seeds and move to centre. Somehow miscalculated that white can't contain black.]
;B[fp];W[io];B[en];W[gl];B[hn];W[ho];B[fm];W[gm];B[go];W[fn]
;B[ip];W[jo];B[fl];W[fk];B[js];W[kr]C[wild : Hopeless struggle that only made the situation worse. But I still thought I had a chance by capturing bottom right corner. Is it realistic? I'm not very good with corner variations.

EE: White can sacrifice q4 comparably cheaply. In comparison, capturing H4 is both huge and gives White excellent thickness. Game looks bad for Black.]
;B[qp]LB[qo:a][rn:b]C[wild : Can I capture the corner with this? Any better way to capture it?

EE: To not touch what you are attacking, you could try 'a' or 'b'. White might play 'a' later to make some shape on the right.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[mr]C[wild : Feeling a little insecure. Just play a sente here to make sure white can't do anything funny near O2.

EE: Good.];W[lr];B[fh];W[em];B[ib];W[gd];B[qk];W[rc];B[rb];W[qd]
;B[pc];W[ld];B[ph]C[EE: Good reply.];W[qh];B[pf];W[pg];B[og]
;W[qg];B[of]LB[ke:a][kf:b]C[EE: Don't save forcing stones. Better capture White with 'a' or 'b'.]
;W[pj];B[kg]C[wild : Trying my best to regain the previous lost. Overplayed?

EE: You have to be a bit greedy to catch up.];W[qo]LB[qn:a]
C[wild : White has made his move. Can black capture corner? How?   EE: Maybe 'a', but it looks very difficult.

wild: As you will see later, I failed miserably.];B[po];W[qn]
LB[rp:a][qq:b]C[EE: Now you will probably have to play 'a' or 'b' to help your corner stone and let White take the right side.]
