C[[Actorios\] Many thanks in advance for reviewing this game... I really felt I didn't make the best out of my hoshi play. I would really like to understand my mistakes... to avoid getting into a similar situation in future games.

Dudzik: Hi, I'm Dudzik[1d\] and I'll be your reviewer for today!

In summary, after a bad choice of direction and some slow moves on the right side, you were behind.  After that you needed to make some chances to get back in the game, but you played too solidly, missed some big points on the board, and used your wall--your key asset--to make territory instead of attacking.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[oc];W[pp]C[[Actorios\] My idea was to exchange the last corner for the key point between his shimari and my hoshi stone at Q4. I played 2 hoshi so not to be delayed in the opening

Dudzik: I think this is a really good plan.];B[dp];W[qj];B[nq]
;W[pn]C[[Actorios\] I didn't want to play the pincer due to D4 so I played the 1 point jump

Dudzik: Looks nice, no mistakes so far.];B[qq]C[[Actorios\] I believe I had to prevent an easy connection here. shouls I have played R4 instead ? It seems very submissive.

Dudzik: Q3 is important right now, you can play R4 in a moment.]
;W[pq];B[pr]
(;W[or]LB[qp:A]SQ[qj]C[Dudzik: I think this move is bad.  You are fighting to make a wall towards the bottom side, but you have no other stones there.  With the marked stone, I like A better, to secure the right stones in sente.  See the variation.]
;B[qr];W[oq];B[ro]C[[Actorios\] I've just checked : this is joseki. Still, I didn't like much my situation. I've lost one of my 2 corners (but what could I have expected: I did play 2 hoshis).]
;W[np]LB[rn:A]C[[Actorios\] Is it too small of a move ? I can see it is not joseki

Dudzik: I think this move is fine, but I like containing him at A better.]
;B[qm]
(;W[pm]LB[qg:A]SQ[dp]C[Dudzik: This is a perfectly reasonable move, as you're keeping your stones connected. (though, as I said earlier, this wall's potential is less than it should be, due to the marked stone.  You shouldn't extend to A yet.]
;B[ql];W[pl];B[nr];W[mp];B[os];W[mr]LB[jd:B][qf:C][dj:A][oj:D]
[qk:E]C[Dudzik: This feels slow.  A or B are extremely large and indirectly help your weaknesses.  Playing on the right side (e.g. C,D,E) also makes sense.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[ok];W[rn]LB[qg:A]C[Dudzik: Should definitely be at A.]
;B[qn];W[qo];B[qp];W[po];B[rm];W[mq]
(;B[ph]TR[nq][nr]C[[Actorios\] Excellent exchange for black. I wanted to play sente but I totally over looked the importance of this capture

Dudzik: The fact that you just killed the marked stones definitely means that you do not have sente. :)]
;W[ns]C[[Actorios\] I went to the end of my threat. but this exchange is clearly bad. Could I have still saved my 2 stones at this stage ?

Dudzik: These stones were already dead--see the variation.  While your stones on the right side have some potential, it's much more important to play on the top and left sides right now.]
;B[oi];W[cj]LB[cn:A]C[[Actorios\] The score estimator already give me 25 points delay on my opponent... The game is getting tough

Dudzik: You are behind and you should probably not play so passively.  I like A better to use your thickness.]
;B[cn];W[fq]LB[jd:A]C[Dudzik: Don't make territory with thickness.  A is bigger, because your way limits how far he can extend on the bottom.]
;B[dr];W[fo]LB[jd:A]C[Dudzik: A is still bigger.  The value of your wall for attacking is much greater than its value for  making territory.]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[ho];W[hn]C[Dudzik: Good idea, pushing him towards your wall.  Don't try too hard to kill him, though.]
;B[io];W[in]LB[gn:A]C[Dudzik: My insticts tell me to pull back to A first.  It's always embarrassing to lose a fight with a wall like that.]
;B[gq]
(;W[iq]LB[jn:C][go:A][fr:B]C[[Actorios\] Played a shape move by reflex... Was it the best option ?

Dudzik: Looks extremely risky to me, he has moves at A, B, and C to cause trouble.  See the variation for an example of what I'm worried about.  Of course you can force at A right now for extra safety.  He gets the shape move but you can hane on the outside and start building a moyo.  See the variation.]
(;B[fr];W[go];B[hp];W[jo]C[Dudzik: Good for you.];B[dl]
(;W[ip]LB[er:A]C[Dudzik: Why not A? :)  See the variation.]
;B[gr];W[cg]LB[jd:A]C[Dudzik: You should play faster if you're behind.  I would much prefer to play A and suffer the invasion.]
;B[fc];W[hc]C[[Actorios\] I guess D17 was the right move but I couldn't let black get more territory. Being behind, I felt I had to fight.

Dudzik: Fair enough.];B[cc];W[dc];B[db]LB[kc:B][cd:A]C[[Actorios\] I think black didn't play the joseki here but what could I have done to punish it?

Dudzik: Usually A would be a good move here, you'll get sente to play B.  But you probably want to do what you did to get a chance at getting back in the game.]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[be]C[[Actorios\] Yet another corner lost : the game is lost unless I build a massive territory in the center. My morale was at the lowest.]
(;W[kc]LB[mc:A][ld:B]C[Dudzik: Should probably be at A or B.  You can't win by playing territorially.  Compare with the variations.]
(;B[md];W[ke];B[lf];W[kf];B[lg]LB[jh:A][ej:B]TR[lf]C[[Actorios\] The score estimator is saying that the position is even. Can this be possible ? I was feeling so much behind... Is there still a chance to overcome black here ?

Dudzik: Black's last two moves were bad, as you got more in the exchange..  But he should still be able to limit your center territory enough to win pretty easily--A and B are miai.]
(;W[qh]LB[rd:A]C[[Actorios\] I felt I had to do someting so I tried to shinogi... I knew my chances were thin but I couldn't see myself win otherwise. Did I underestimate my chances to win through my moyos ?

Dudzik: I think your evaluation of the situation is right.  I think you should probe at A first, though.  See the variations.]
