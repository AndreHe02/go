Dear reviewew,

I played white in this game and I look forward to seeing your comments. The opening was a little chaotic and I hope you can let me know what was good and bad there. I came out of it feeling a little ahead, but in the end lost by 2.5pts.

Greg];B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[qk];W[nc];B[kd];W[pf]C[Is white O15 better than Q14?

reid: I think either way is playable.];B[nd];W[qc];B[qd];W[md]
C[Is this OK or is q17 more normal?

reid: The order is wrong here.  N16 should be before R17.  Black really has no choice but to respond at O15.  But after the white R17 / black R16 exchange, the corner is bigger and black has options.

If white doesn't exchange N16 for O15 before he plays R17, then he really needs to play Q17 now.]
;B[oc];W[ne];B[od];W[mb];B[me];W[le];B[mf];W[ld];B[of]C[I'm surprised that black did not play atari at O18. Would this be the correct thing for him to do? Seems to make my shape pretty clumsy.

reid: Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, although a few moves ago (before of N15) might have been the right time.  I guess he was worried you might try to pull O15 out and start fighting.  But you probably can't really do that just yet.]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[ng]C[reid: I think this might be a little early.  There might be other ways to take advantage of the aji in this area.]
;B[nf];W[pj];B[qj];W[lf];B[mg];W[lg];B[mh];W[lh];B[mi];W[df]
C[I felt pretty good at this point. I have a large moyo and the left, and his territory has lots of aji such as R18 ko and the Q10 has lots of uses.

reid:  Yes, there is aji there, but even if you can make some of those stones live, black has a fair amount of real territory here.  White has no real territory yet.  It's a dangerous strategy.

Pushing from behind (M14, etc) is usually to be avoided.  And perhaps D15 would be a safer way to build the moyo - a stronger grip on the corner makes it harder for black to invade.]
;B[ec]C[Something like this invasion was now bound to happen. I felt like here I tried to kill a bit too hard and my result wasn't as good as I could have had. Do you agree?

reid: Well, things seem to go fairly well up to about move 44 (F13).]
;W[ed];B[fc];W[db];B[fd];W[ic];B[ee];W[dd];B[he];W[fg]LB[kc:D]
[ef:A][gf:C][eg:B]C[This move felt a little loose to me. Did I have any better choices here? I wanted to play on this side to drive him towards my thickness.

reid: Yeah, I agree it's a bit loose.  For example, if black A, white might be nervous about blocking at B.

Driving black towards the white wall seems like a good idea, but I think a longer term strategy might work better:  instead of F13, white D (L17) takes immediate territory and denies white any chance of a base.  As white runs out, black will naturally take more territory along the left side.  I think the top side plus the left side would compensate for black's right side.]
;B[id]LB[jb:A]C[reid: Hmm, this looks like aji-keshi to me.  White has to worry about black activating L16 somehow  - I'm thinking something like a probe at A (K18).   But J16 invites white to fix his problem.  Does black need this exchange now?]
;W[jc];B[ig];W[ii]LB[jh:A]C[Would H17 be better here? Keep him eyeless and attackable? Or is the cap at J11 better?

reid:  White needs to be a bit careful here.  Black pushing in at L17l looks a potential problem.  Any move around A (K12) is black's sente because of this threat.  Perhaps white should play A just to preempt black.]
;B[hc];W[jd];B[je];W[hb];B[gb];W[ib];B[ke];W[gd];B[ge];W[kc]
;B[gg];W[qb];B[oa];W[na];B[nb]LB[mc:A]C[reid: This is a difficult ko for white to win,  Black A is pretty much sente, so white's threats need to be big.]
;W[hd];B[gc];W[ob];B[de];W[ce];B[nb];W[hd];B[ie];W[ob];B[ef]
;W[pa]LB[dg:B][eg:A]C[reid: taking this corner is big: at least 25 points.  But white gives up a lot to get it.

If we ignore the ko, blocking at A (or pulling back with B if you're nervous about all those cuts) is natural.  I would prefer to play here and leave the ko active.]
;B[dg];W[cf];B[eg];W[cg];B[di];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[po]
LB[co:C][do:B][jq:A]C[Was this the right decision given the overall board position? I was debating K4 or somewhere around there, but I feel like him getting M4 or something like that would be too good for him.

reid: White A (K4) is the small side (both D3 and Q3 are on the third line, so this side is small.

White might also consider B or C (C5 or D5) but a black response at Q5 makes the R9 stones look very good, so I think Q5 is appropriate.]
;B[qp]C[I was not expecting this. I feel like this exchange was good for me.]
;W[jp]LB[co:A]C[reid: Yes, R4 is a bit strange.  White can consider this a forcing exchange in his favor, but then I think a better continuation would be white A (C5) to take corner territory rather than K4.

If white is going to play on this side, the third line would be better.  The center is not valuable for white due to N11 and D11, and Q3 under-cuts the value of K4 for taking the side.]
;B[lp]C[reid: Hmm, does black think he can get everything to the right of M4 and N11?  There is too much aji in Q5.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[pp];B[qr];W[nq];B[mr];W[qo];B[rp];W[no];B[ln]
;W[om]LB[qm:A]C[This felt really slow to me. Was there anything better around here?

reid: Well, it might feel slow, but you need to take the time to make this group alive or the game is over.  A (R7) might work also, but it feels slow too.]

;B[il];W[kk];B[jj];W[gl]LB[cj:B][cl:A]C[Maybe instead of this, just a move around D8 is enough? Do I need to reduce th middle?

reid: A (D8) is difficult: when  black pushes down towards the left edge, he threatens territory both above and below.  White B (C10) prevents that, but then black can enlarge his center pretty significantly.  Reducing the center seems like a better idea.

I think the biggest problem in this game for white was pushing along at M12.  Black got real profit there while white could not make enough from his moyo to compensate.  Be wary of giving away territory in exchange for a moyo!

Good luck, play strong,
