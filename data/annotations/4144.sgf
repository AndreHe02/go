C[Dakre: Hello, I had a very difficult game here to play... I felt somewhat ahead after the early opening, but that changed quite fast during the middlegame. I would like you to point out your thoughts especially concerning the middlegame, but as well to the opening if you find the time. I played black in this game, but i will send it to Tilo playing white, too.
Thanks in advance.

I don't see the obvious mistake making me loose this game.
So I'd like you to point out, where it is cristal clear, that
another move would have been better ;)

*Hello Dakre, I am Thomas Derz, 3d (Eur) and I enjoy commenting on your game. To relativate the value of my comments that my weaknesses are Joseki and Fuseki (and endgame). I am not bad in shape and middle game. 
My comments will be marked and start with an asterix *
I will call White "she" and indicate white moves and stones with "her".

Summary of big mistakes:
W24 - wrong technique, add a 2nd stone, then sacrifice
B37 does not take advantage of the black wall. The white shimari could have been harassed well, perhaps killed.
B111, B119 -  concept of semeais
B143 save pivotal cutting stones];B[pd];W[dc];B[po];W[cp];B[de]

*good thought, good move]
(;W[fd]LB[fc:m][ce:g][cm:e][cl:f][dd:n][cc:s][df:p][dg:o]TR[pd]
C[*at W8 I have the following consideration and thoughts:

1) If white had attached at "g" with move W8, then she had taken the corner (with tsuke) while ending in gote at "m" (just above W8 now).
This is under the assumption that Black would play the tsuke-hiki-joseki.
I had preferred this for white.

Black could then play the same 2-point extension to "e" as in the game (in order to avoid the same white checking extension "f" there.

I am not qualified to say W8 is better than tsuke "g" or vice versa.

2) On white tsuke "g" Black could also play the nadare joseki with "n".
This makes sense due to the black triangled hoshi on the top right.

The nadare is a joseki which can become quite tactical, long and may have big impact on the question whose's groups are weak or where future in fluence will be.

Hence B7 might look i) funny and useless afterwards (perhaps with variants where White plays the conversative "s" instead of the "p"=small nadare, resp. "o"=o-nadare) OR 
ii) contribute to a black tactical succes (if white plays the sharp variants (as if there was no B7)). => hence, no clear answer from me here to a question you never put forward.

I am not a joseki or fuseki expert, but in my games I have these considerations in mind when deciding on the moves.]

[ce:g]C[Dakre: I played this because c10 seemed to be too far away and it should already be settled when white plans to invade around c13 (even if thats much too early anyway now :) )

*13=c7 here is good because it prevents the white checking extension c8=b, followed by black c.
If white had attached at g with move W8, then she had taken the corner (with tsuke) while ending in gote.
I had preferred this for white. Now Black looks good to me.
(cf. my comment on W8 and alternatives)]
(;W[pq]TR[eq]C[*W14: the triangled stone is already low and W14 runs the danger to be pressed down as well (what exactly happens after B15).

perhaps 3-3 avoids being pressed down by settling the corner stone immedeatly.]
