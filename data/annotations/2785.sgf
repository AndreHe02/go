RE[B+7.50]

C[Hello,

I hope my comments will help to improve your game. Please keep in mind that I am still learning myself. ;-)

It is difficult to say something about general strategy because a high handicap game is special. But regarding the huge difference in rank you played very well. 

You will improve greatly if you practice your reading ability by playing or solving problems.]
;AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hello my name is Abygail, i play black, I'm ~15k
Bokaiido is white and he is 2k

I'd like a review for black, Thx ^^

-----
Hello Abygail, it will be a pleasure to review this game. High handicap games are special - I think I can benefit too when I recall the strategies. ;-)

With such a high handicap the reading ability of White is normally superior. You should not be discouraged if White manages to kill big groups or invade where you thought "your" territory would be.

Let`s see...];W[nc];B[pf];W[gd];B[df];W[jf];B[le]MA[md][ke]
[ie]C[----
Good. This is a common strategy for White. The right way is to not let yourself be surrounded but instead seperate White. A promising start.

Yet you should keep in mind that the small knight`s move of M15 may be easily cut. White may do so when strenghened his groups. Other ideas of moving out are marked.]

(;B[kh]C[Is K12 better for black? The purpose was to remain White cutted and to go out for tehe center group

------
Your strategy is good.
K12 can easily be cut. This diagonal move looks ok to me.];W[lc]

(;B[kd]C[This is bad, i Guessed. K15 better? Or K17? Or M16?

may be none ^^

Here i was afraid of being cutted


-----
K17 and M16 are indeed better shape.];W[ki];B[jh];W[ji]
(;B[ii]C[---------
This complicates the situation. Try to keep things simple and just move on.]
;W[ih];B[ig];W[hh]
(;B[if]C[-----
A very passive move. It may be better to push out with H13.

see var

The key is to not let yourself be confined. Whilst breaking out you seperate the white stones. Subsequently they will become weak and easy targets to attack.

Also: if you let yourself be surrounded, you have to seek a small live. White with the better reading ability may kill your group.]
;W[gg]C[Not very good sequence for Black. Why?


-----
Your stones are surrounded and thus have less influence on other parts of the board.

Moreover your stones are not yet alive];B[hc];W[hd];B[gc];W[ie]
;B[id];W[je];B[jg];W[hf]
(;B[fd]C[This is not enough, is it? N9 is better or may be or Q18?

-----
I do not think that this move is too bad. It threatens White`s shape. White has to answer this move somehow. Taking the initiative is the right spirit.

I don`t like N9 . It is not a real threat to the white group. 

Q18 is small and can be played in the endgame.];W[lh]
(;B[kg]MA[hj][fh]C[Bad, is L14 better, or may be i don't need to defend? N9 is the best attack?


------------
Yes. L14 is better shape.

N9 is not good. You have to defend here or White will capture
Also N9 does not really attack the White group very much. The other group is much more vulnerable because it does not have a base.

Surrounding it on a large scale would be a good way to put pressure on it and stake out some potential territory. But first you may have to strengthen your cutting stone at J11.]
;W[jb]
(;B[ic]C[------
variation is better shape. It would save a move later on.];W[hk]
;B[ij]C[------
Or try to fight back with H10.];W[gi];B[jl];W[jn];B[im];W[in]
;B[hm]C[Poor move, H6 better?

-----------
This move is ok. It keeps yourself in shape and prevents White from linking his stones.

H6 makes things complicated. As Black with a high handicap you want to keep things simple. If you start complicated fights White most certainly will outread you and have the advantage]
;W[dh]
(;B[eg]MA[dn][fp][np][pn]C[Poor, can i aford to play E12 or C12?

----------
You do not have to answer every move of White. White is just stretching and trying to live because you nearly surrounded him. 

Maybe it is just time to take more territory. If you want to answer locally, maybe a move at C14 is enough. This takes territory and makes it more difficult for White to invade the upper left corner

Whites move doeas not threaten any of your stones. You could ignore White here and play one of the marked points. Look all big to me.

Better yet is to take the initiative and start fighting. For some ideas see variations]
;W[di];B[dm]C[better tp lay D9 or E10?


-------------
I like this move. There is no point in adding more stones to D10. This would just make it heavy.]
;W[ce]
(;B[cf]C[C16 better to save the corner?

-------------
Yes. Sometimes it is better to defend your territory. It is a common idea to let White enter the corner and live there. Black uses his resulting strength to then attack the stones on the outside. But here there is not a lot to attack. The two white stones can easyly connect with their allies.

So yes. Better defend your corner. White still has to add more stones to be safe.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[bd]
(;B[de]C[Argh! B15 much better, isn't it?

B5 is better.];W[be];B[dc];W[cb];B[bf];W[db];B[eb];W[ab];B[ei]
;W[eh]
(;B[fi]C[F12 better?


----------
With F12 you would at least have the chance to cut. This move only helps White to connect his stones.]
;W[fh];B[fk];W[cj];B[dk];W[ck];B[cl]C[Too late, how to use black wall in BCD14?

-----------
This wall has no prospects from the beginning. See move 52]
;W[bh]
(;B[ib]C[Bad too little, i was afraid, i felt if i don't play this one it'll be difficult to have 2 eyes. I was wrong, i guess?

N9 better instead of J18? What would u play here?


------------
No, I think you are right to make eyes for your group. I think I would play this move too :-) It is possible to live without this move, but you can not afford the slightest mistake. Because White is the better reader I would rather secure my group with this move. I think you can afford it. If you lose this group it`s over]

C[Bokaiido [2k\]: hehe
Abygail [20k?\]: ^^];W[ip]
(;B[gp]C[Bad! K5 better or L4?


-------------
It is very difficult to kill White. Your strategy should be to sourround White and press from the outside so as to let him live small and gain territory whilst attacking.

K3 looks indeed better. It builds a wall to the right and while White tries to live at the left you could build a wall there too.

But keep in mind that C3 and R3 still are open for an invasion.]

-----------
B6 is gote. You have to defend after White plays B7.

S6 is gote, too. But it protects the corner more or less.

P18 is very big.

I think I would play Black P18, White O18, Black S6.

Another idea is B5 which threatens a big follow-up at B7. White will most likely answer there.]

You should not too much be concerned of the right order, you are doing not too bad. This move is ok. I marked some other big moves. The first thing you should improve is your reading ability though. ;-)

Anyway it is easy for you and a good practice to find the correct order. Just count the points. I am too lazy ;-)
