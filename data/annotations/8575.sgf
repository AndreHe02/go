AB[dp][pd]C[Hello,
I will review for both black and white. Please take my advice and opinions with a grain of salt :) Enjoy.
Yun];W[cd]C[viaken [15k?\]: Good luck
viaken [15k?\]: And now you do

---
White's strategy could be a bit more active, such as playing on D16, as white has a handicap.]
;B[pq];W[qc]C[xenofungus [?\]: good luck
------

Here white may opt for a more assertive approach. Going for the corner and letting black be thick on the top is not good for white.]
(;B[oc]C[This move is a little 'loose' on white.
Here black may go for a more direct move, such as R16 or Q17, depending on which side black wants to focus on. Personally I would go for R16]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[pf];W[hd]C[White is too thin here. But as black did not enter top left, this was not a problem.]
;B[kc];W[ic];B[qh]C[xenofungus [?\]: if you want to comment on anything]
;W[rg];B[rh]C[xenofungus [?\]: maybe closer to the corner

---
There are other bigger moves than this one. as white can still enter left]
(;W[jp]C[viaken [15k?\]: What was 18?
viaken [15k?\]: Oh? Ok.

----
Probably F3 is best, but can also consider K3];B[gq]C[viaken [15k?\]: Which took away my possible base]
;W[jq]C[xenofungus [?\]: this move
viaken [15k?\]: Yeah, I was unsure about that
viaken [15k?\]: I thought about jumping out, but I figured you would just play under me
xenofungus [?\]: i think the problem is that it does not help you claim more territory
viaken [15k?\]: You would connect, and that stone would have no usefulness
xenofungus [?\]: but even if i dont connect
xenofungus [?\]: a solid wall wont change the score too much
viaken [15k?\]: Right
xenofungus [?\]: if you had more stones nearby, then you could make base with them
viaken [15k?\]: Yeah
xenofungus [?\]: 17
xenofungus [?\]: hmmm
xenofungus [?\]: no, i think the first stone was too in the middle
viaken [15k?\]: I wasn't planning on making one there, but I could've.]
;B[lq];W[ho];B[cm];W[ci];B[cj];W[di];B[dj]
(;W[ej];B[ei];W[ek];B[eh];W[dg]C[viaken [15k?\]: I need to start playing more often.
xenofungus [?\]: same here];B[bi];W[ch]C[xenofungus [?\]: that looks a bit too concentrated
xenofungus [?\]: and its an empty triangle, it is kind of infamous xD]
;B[pm]C[viaken [15k?\]: Right. :) I keep making them, even though I keep reading about how bad they are.
viaken [15k?\]: That gives you the corner
xenofungus [?\]: kind of does
xenofungus [?\]: i almost lost it later xD]
(;W[fe]C[Killing the E12 black stones/saving K4 group should be priority...


viaken [15k?\]: That might've been better at G13?
xenofungus [?\]: im not sure how winable the game was at this point (as in dunno how weak i am), but here you need to be much much more aggresive to come back
xenofungus [?\]: no, i think you should have attacked me
viaken [15k?\]: Ok, can you giv eme an example?
xenofungus [?\]: or tried to take the center
xenofungus [?\]: hmmm
viaken [15k?\]: Because this is something I know I'm lacking
xenofungus [?\]: im not good with invasions either, but i think you could have tried to connect your corners together
viaken [15k?\]: M/N17, maybe?
xenofungus [?\]: or maybe tried to crush the "base" i have around n 15
xenofungus [?\]: hmm that might be a bit high, but yes, something like that
xenofungus [?\]: probably my lower-left corner was attackable too
viaken [15k?\]: Yeah
viaken [15k?\]: And the lower right was some as well, it seems
xenofungus [?\]: yes
xenofungus [?\]: i have lots of stones, but they are far away
viaken [15k?\]: Also thought about trying to cut the R12 group off, but didn't see a clean way to accomplish that.
xenofungus [?\]: hmm];B[ke]C[Not a bad move-- certainly not only defensive-- If E12 group were to survive K4 group is very weak on bottom  and will have tough fight.

viaken [15k?\]: defensive, slow play again
xenofungus [?\]: im not sure about this move, if someone reads this, please review it for me xD]
;W[if]
(;B[gh]C[viaken [15k?\]: G12? I seemed to grab that fairly easily, but I don't know that that was teh best sequence for me.
xenofungus [?\]: i wasnt really sure either
xenofungus [?\]: i think by this point i was trying to scare you]
;W[ih];B[kh];W[hj]C[xenofungus [?\]: because that
xenofungus [?\]: my g12 didnt do much but make your "base" bigger
viaken [15k?\]: It what/
viaken [15k?\]: ah, right
xenofungus [?\]: hmm
viaken [15k?\]: May have given me a chance to cut into all the territory you were grabbing while I was fiddling with that
xenofungus [?\]: i think its ok
xenofungus [?\]: your stones in e10 are weak by themselves
xenofungus [?\]: and you should save your lower group
viaken [15k?\]: ok
viaken [15k?\]: That does make sense
xenofungus [?\]: if anything, it could be played a little bit lower, but im not reading it too much so im not sure]
;B[lm]
(;W[jm]C[White can still live in corner.];B[kk];W[lo];B[ko]
;W[kn]C[xenofungus [?\]: this sequence is why i say i dont like the shapes i make]
;B[kp];W[ln];B[mm];W[mn]C[viaken [15k?\]: There was probably better shape to be had there]
;B[nn]C[viaken [15k?\]: maybe 49 at o5
xenofungus [?\]: i think the issue is that you were fighting to reduce my territory but you gained nothing
viaken [15k?\]: On the larger scale, yeha
xenofungus [?\]: unless you kill my group at l5, that i dont think is possible]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[nq];B[np];W[no]C[viaken [15k?\]: I feel like you're in the lead.]
;B[oo]C[xenofungus [?\]: im not sure
viaken [15k?\]: Still, 39 likely could've been at j or k. I shouldn't have been so quick to grab for your group, I feel like.]
;W[op];B[po]C[xenofungus [?\]: i almost lose a lot
viaken [15k?\]: Really? I looked at O7 before P6.
xenofungus [?\]: yes, my mistake]
(;W[jo];B[nr];W[oq];B[or]
(;W[pp];B[qp]C[viaken [15k?\]: From our previous branch];W[pr]
;B[np]C[viaken [15k?\]: Oh, right :)];W[mo]C[xenofungus [?\]: well, the reading mistake is easy to fix]

C[viaken [15k?\]: Less so than me, this game. :)
xenofungus [?\]: yes, this one
viaken [15k?\]: Probably shouldn't have attempted to kill the D10 group
xenofungus [?\]: i think that you were not strong enough
viaken [15k?\]: *nod*
xenofungus [?\]: most of your stones are not connected and you spend some moves trying to fix it]

;B[gk];W[gj];B[el]C[viaken [15k?\]: that didn't help me any]
;W[fi];B[fl];W[fj]C[viaken [15k?\]: overconcentrated again
xenofungus [?\]: to be honest i dont know how i got to connect my border with the center xD
xenofungus [?\]: but yes, you overconcentrated
xenofungus [?\]: i have that problem too];B[hk];W[ik];B[ij]
;W[hi];B[il];W[im]C[viaken [15k?\]: I'm pretty sure I've lost, unless I pull of something impressive.
viaken [15k?\]: heh
viaken [15k?\]: Spent a long time on that move, and I was sure there were better. K8 would've forced your capture, though, as would G8 and H8.
xenofungus [?\]: this was luck, i was not thinking about connecting as much as punishing your ovenconcentration
xenofungus [?\]: yes, but the connection was done already
viaken [15k?\]: yes];B[hm]C[xenofungus [?\]: here i noticed your group didnt have two eyes xD
viaken [15k?\]: For some reason, I get stuck in the trap of seeing my big groups, realizing they're overconcentrated, but still giving them more influence than they deserve.
viaken [15k?\]: I think 109 at L3 would have saved it, too.
xenofungus [?\]: yes
xenofungus [?\]: well
xenofungus [?\]: i think it does not
viaken [15k?\]: But, yeah. Had I realized... :)
xenofungus [?\]: the second eye could be in j6 too]
(;W[hn];B[gp];W[gm];B[gl];W[hl];B[jk]C[xenofungus [?\]: i still have time to make a big mistake xD]
;W[eo];B[hm]C[viaken [15k?\]: This was just ko madness. I think I thought I might get your G8 group.
viaken [15k?\]: Pretty sure it was a pipe dream.
xenofungus [?\]: yes, i think it was secured];W[dn];B[gn]C[viaken [15k?\]: So do I. ;) We'll see how it goes.]
;W[em];B[cn];W[gm];B[en];W[hl];B[ik]C[viaken [15k?\]: Right]

;B[hm];W[gn];B[ep];W[fo];B[hp]C[viaken [15k?\]: aaaand, eyes gone
xenofungus [?\]: nah, thers still l3
viaken [15k?\]: Ah right
xenofungus [?\]: ups
xenofungus [?\]: lets forget about that xD
viaken [15k?\]: heh :) You can get to bed. this is the end of teh game, anyway]
(;W[iq];B[kq];W[lr];B[ls]C[I did not review much for second half since it's mostly endgame things. The main point is that white did not play as assertively as it could, thus letting black become thick.
On the other hand, black needed to utilize its strength on the right to its full use.

Overall, both sides played well and there weren't major mistakes.

viaken [15k?\]: speaking of big mistakes
viaken [15k?\]: Alright, I think that's it for me.
viaken [15k?\]: Thank you for the game. :)
xenofungus [?\]: thank you too
xenofungus [?\]: so, what do we do now, we have to submit this somehow, right?
viaken [15k?\]: Nicely done on that big group
viaken [15k?\]: Yeah, I'm looking up the instructions now.
viaken [15k?\]: I think winner reports
xenofungus [?\]: ah, ill check then
viaken [15k?\]: Hm...I can't save the SGF. Can you?
xenofungus [?\]: yes you can
xenofungus [?\]: i think
viaken [15k?\]: I found the link.
xenofungus [?\]: where is it?
viaken [15k?\]: I'd paste it to you, but paste isn't working in this client. heh
viaken [15k?\]: If you go to gokgs.com and hit archives, you can search by user
xenofungus [?\]: ah, yes
xenofungus [?\]: then i send a message to the organizer with the file?
viaken [15k?\]: I think you'd create a post: "Tournament: xenofungus 17k vs dpflug 15k" with that link
xenofungus [?\]: ah, ok, ill do
viaken [15k?\]: And yes, report to Hellzapoppin
xenofungus [?\]: ok, got it
xenofungus [?\]: ill report and stuff
xenofungus [?\]: then we can review the game if you want
viaken [15k?\]: I've got time if you do.
viaken [15k?\]: Your shape is much better than mine.
viaken [15k?\]: overall
xenofungus [?\]: but i think it was weak, ive been punished for it before
viaken [15k?\]: I think invasion is one of my weak points for now.
xenofungus [?\]: your handle in reddit is?
viaken [15k?\]: dpflug
viaken [15k?\]: Although, maybe I should've just created a new account to avoid the confusion. :)
xenofungus [?\]: ok, thread done
xenofungus [?\]: ill message hellzapoppin
viaken [15k?\]: Ok, thanks
viaken [15k?\]: Ok, I don't know what Firefox is doing, but it's showing that hall of mirrors/constant window cloning that you'd see when older versions of Windows would crash...
xenofungus [?\]: that sounds bad
viaken [15k?\]: Kept it up for ~3min, then went back to normal.
xenofungus [?\]: ok, all done
xenofungus [?\]: i think you have the review controls
viaken [15k?\]: Huh...apparently.
xenofungus [?\]: yes
xenofungus [?\]: how much have you played before?
viaken [15k?\]: Still under 30 games, so :) fairly new.
xenofungus [?\]: i see
viaken [15k?\]: And a lot of those have been with people I taught, so not so many more skilled opponents.
viaken [15k?\]: Which is why I feel my rank is wrong.
xenofungus [?\]: yes, ive tried to teach lots of people
viaken [15k?\]: Luckily, my g/f and roommate seem to like it.
xenofungus [?\]: my rank was probably wrong too
xenofungus [?\]: i had no such luck, but thers stil kgs
viaken [15k?\]: yep
xenofungus [?\]: it would probably be bettter without handicap
xenofungus [?\]: its hard to play around it, specially for us lowranks
viaken [15k?\]: Better, but I don't know that it would've made up this difference.
viaken [15k?\]: maybe, though
viaken [15k?\]: I just need to play more.
xenofungus [?\]: yes, same here
viaken [15k?\]: I just keep getting crushed on here because a 12k basically threw a game.
viaken [15k?\]: Which put my rank at 15k. heh
xenofungus [?\]: i had somethings similar with a 11k, that gave me 16k
xenofungus [?\]: then i lost to a friend and dropped down again
xenofungus [?\]: you have to play a lot for ranks to work
viaken [15k?\]: right
viaken [15k?\]: Alright, suppose I should let you head to bed. Nice to meet another Arch user, though. :)
xenofungus [?\]: ah, true xD
xenofungus [?\]: well, im going
viaken [15k?\]: Sleep well
xenofungus [?\]: if you see me idling here feel free to ask for a rematch
viaken [15k?\]: Will do :) Maybe without the handi next time.
xenofungus [?\]: yes
