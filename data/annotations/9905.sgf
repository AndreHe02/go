C[[r\] Hi, I am your assigned reviewer and I hope I can help you by adding a few notes to the game.
Feel free to get back to me either via email or at kgs (my new username is "darkronin").

I think in general the game started out really well for black, but unfortunately turned good for white at some point in the middle game. Then there were two more swings. Anyway, I hope the comments will prove useful. Enjoy!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[jp];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[[r\] the opening was flawless up to here!]

(;W[po]LB[nq:A]C[[r\] you could perhaps consider approaching at A in this circumstance. see var]
;B[qo]
(;W[qn]TR[pp]C[[r\] i'd still consider the avalanche option - starting at triangle, see var.]
;B[qp];W[pn];B[nq]C[[r\] as black, i'd be very happy to be able to play here :-)]
;W[qj]
(;B[fc]LB[qh:A]C[[r\] this is a bit strange, because normally one wants to put pressure on the white group on the right with a move around A, which is almost sente (see var).
Regardless, the game is slightly in black's favour at this point.]
;W[cf];B[db]
(;W[cc]LB[gc:B][hc:A]C[[r\] as white, I would have thought of A or B.
White is already behind territorially, a normal joseki that does not wreck up black's plan is not enough here!]
;B[hd]LB[jc:A][qh:B]C[[r\] a bit greedy.  leaves a weak point at A.
This, combined with the missed approach at B, gives white an excellent chance to turn things around]

(;W[nc]C[[r\] honestly i would first approach the corner from the other side, then exploit the K17 weakness :-)]

(;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc]LB[lc:A][mc:B]C[[r\] here i think that black went wrong - of course he should have played the 'wrap in' variation starting at A or B.
Both players have been a little too soft on the top side];W[kc]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[ic];W[kd];B[ch];W[cb];B[dc];W[ed];B[fd];W[dg]
;B[dh];W[fg];B[dk]C[[r\] looking good for black];W[eh]LB[qh:A]
C[[r\] i would tenuki as black here and take R12
Usually responding to a move like E12 only helps the opponent to make good shape... so my advice is, don't help opponent :-)]
;B[ei];W[fi];B[ej]C[[r\] now black took gote :-)
because he helped white in the situation that was locally favourable for him]
;W[fj];B[fk];W[fe];B[ge];W[gf];B[hf];W[hg];B[if];W[ie]C[[r\] questionable - see next comment at the end of the pushes - move 62]
;B[he];W[jf];B[ig];W[hh]C[[r\] in my opinion white did not accomplish much by pushing black first from left, then from the top.
White should have taken sente at move 58.];B[no]C[[r\] black is now ahead and has the initiative!]
;W[fp];B[kq]C[[r\] watch out: this kind of move invites a 'wall response' (K3) are rarely good for you.
If White K3, it's good for white]
(;W[ir]C[[r\] white submitted and leaves all kinds of aji for black to exploit]
;B[kp];W[jo];B[ln];W[nm];B[ll];W[qh]C[[r\] it was very awkward for black to let white get this huge point.]
;B[qb];W[ne];B[pg];W[rg];B[rf];W[ph];B[oh]C[[r\] tip: don't hane attaching to a wall :-)
(you will get cut)];W[og]
(;B[of]C[[r\] no, no, no!! black, please don't atari! you are only helping white!]

;B[cl];W[gm];B[fl];W[fm]LB[fl:1][fm:2]C[[r\] this kind of exchange 1-2 is best left unplayed.]
;B[jm];W[in];B[im];W[hj]C[[r\] white is now comfortably leading - too bad for black :(]

C[[r\] a bit reckless for white to leave black D14 unattended]

;B[hk];W[ij];B[ea];W[ca];B[gj];W[ec]C[[r\] if you fill out your own liberties, then you have to come back and defend (if there are cutting aji and/or unattended enemy stones nearby).

(;B[nh]C[[r\] this is the proper way to fight. Let white fix his own weaknesses, if he can]

(;W[jq]C[[r\] now white is strong and black has to worry about a lot of things - basically black has to take gote now]

(;B[qh];W[oj];B[fc]))
(;W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[qn]C[[r\] one possible variation...];W[pr]
;B[qq];W[np]C[[r\] this gives black sente, but the bottom is now yours - a small victory in this fuseki, where black tried to play the kobayashi and emphasized the lower side, instead of the right side.

This is only one of many variations, that is why, as white, it is possible to consider not giving black the choice and finish the lower side at move 16.]
))
(;W[nq];B[qo]C[[r\] locally it was the wrong side to approach the 3-4 stone, but you completed the formation on the lower side, and now have sente.]
