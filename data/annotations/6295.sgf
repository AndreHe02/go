C[Hi im Tibul KGS 4k and i'll be reviewing your game, I'll primarily focus on black, any questions feel free to contact me on KGS.

Always remember urgent points before big points.

Try not to end up with too many weak groups.

Dont always need to connect groups if they are both safe.

More games and some life and death problems will help alot.]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[dq];W[pd];B[qf];W[do];B[co]C[Good opening by black]
;W[np]
(;B[ce]C[Maybe a little low on the side with the C5 stone being low, maybe D15 for black instead]

(;W[bd]C[Your next move at C12 is ok but the white stone at B16 could later threaten to take away the base from your two stones.

I've included a few possible variations that may give you an idea of other moves to try.]

(;B[ch];W[re];B[qe];W[qd];B[nc]LB[oe:A]C[O17 is a bit thin as it can easily be cut by white at A leaving you with 2 weak groups.]
