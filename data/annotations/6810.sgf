C[Hello Jez,

I reviewed your game and I would like to let you know I am about 7 kyu on KGS so please do not take my comments as absolutes.

I liked your very positive style of play and if you continue with this style of play you can only improve. This is why I really enjoyed reviewing your game and added quite a few variations. I hope they help you see some new possibilities.

In general what I would advise to not hesitate to start fights by cutting when you have the advantge (more on that in my comments of the game).

I preceded my comments with P:

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions.

Philippe];B[pp]C[P: Usually black s plays in the upper right. This is a traditional way to show respect to the stronger player who is playing with white.]
;W[pd];B[nq];W[cd];B[dp];W[dn]LB[ec:a][cn:b]C[In hindsight, I wonder if Q10 would have been better here.

P: In principle, in this situation enclosing at A (E17) is slightly bigger than D6 or Q10. D6 is bigger than Q10. My reference for this statement is the workshop lectures vol. 3 by Yilun Yang 7P.

Also be aware that a high approach move such as D6 means you intend to play more of a moyo (influence) style game vs. territorial (such as B at C6).]
;B[de]C[Black played a few of these odd contact moves, but I wasn't sure how to handle them properly.

P: indeed this move is not very conventional. Just for clarity this move is not a contact move since it does not touch your stone. (more on why I want to distinguish this point later when I talk of sabaki in the upper right sequence)]
;W[ec]C[P: this move is fine by white.];B[fd];W[ce];B[cf];W[ed]
;B[ee];W[fe]C[P: very good attacking move, putting pressure on black.]
;B[ff]C[P: G16 is probably better for black.];W[ge];B[gd]
(;W[he]C[P: This move is too easy on black.  

If white wants to cut, there are ladder considerations but white could do well.

See variation.];B[hd];W[dd];B[df];W[ie]C[P: too easy for black, cutting at A (J16) is best , see previous comment and variations for white at H16.]
;B[id];W[jd];B[jc]
(;W[kd]LB[ic:a]C[P: very easy on black, see variation with white A (J17).]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[fc];W[ld];B[ka]C[Black is sealed in and white gets a wall on the outside - I was quite happy with this.

P: the result is not that great for white since white still has a cutting point and black territory (some of it from the 4th line). 

More even results have a trade of thickness on the 4th line and territory within the 3rd line.]
;W[mb]LB[pj:a]C[P: seems like a much too slow move for white it does not accomplish much.

White A (Q10) now works well with the other white stones and ceates a nice moyo where white has influence.]
;B[pe]LB[qe:a]C[...and another agressive contact move. How to handle this?

P: yes this type of contact move is ussually used to make some sort of livable flexible shape (called sabaki)inside a white sphere of influence.

White at A (R15) came to  my mind...]
(;W[oe]C[P: not sure I agree with this move because since white has some power (except for the cutable point) you try to push black towards your thickness.

It seems counter intuitive at first, but the idea is to push black towards your wall while making territory elsewhere (the web site Sensei's library has some examples on how to use thickness).

I show you one possible variation.];B[qd];W[pf];B[pc];W[qe]
C[P: this is nice white shape but the white stones at the top are somewhat over-concentrated.]
;B[nc]C[At this point, I felt like the black stones should be killable, but wasn't sure how to go about doing it.

P: yes killable but not easy, see variations later.];W[qc];B[qb]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[rd];B[ob]
(;W[pk]C[Possibly T17 kills the upper right corner, but maybe this is too small? Either way, this move seems long overdue.

P: Sorry I disagree :)

The corner is rather big. In a GTL review for a previous  game a strong player reminded me of a few principles of the game:

1) corners; 2) the side and 3) the center. Of course in go there exceptions but in this situation the corner seems big. See variation.]
;B[qm];W[ql];B[pi];W[qj];B[sb]C[P: black should have 2 eyes now. This is worth at least 20 points.]
;W[ck]C[By this point, I was quite concerned about a pincer against D6.

P: pushing with B4 maybe first to have options in the corner in case of a pincer.]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[bn];W[bm];B[do];W[en];B[ci];W[eg];B[ef];W[di]
C[Overplay? Perhaps having made bad shape for black with E13 I should throw it away.

P: this move seems ok to me.];B[ch];W[dh];B[dg];W[fh];B[gg]
C[P: too bad white was one move away from sealing black-in and dominating the center.]
;W[gh];B[hg];W[jf];B[ek];W[gk];B[dj]
(;W[dk];B[cj];W[fj];B[ej];W[fm];B[bk];W[dm];B[jg]C[By this point I feel like I've let black's left side group live without getting much in return.

P: yes it was difficult on white but if you go back to say move 54, black had more stones in this area so white could not expect too much.]
;W[kg];B[lg];W[kh];B[lh];W[ki];B[li];W[ni]C[P: good move positive way to play to attack.]
;B[nj];W[oi];B[oj];W[pj];B[ph];W[ng];B[nf];W[ne];B[mf];W[og]
;B[me];W[md];B[lk];W[nk];B[mj];W[nl]C[What's the correct direction to attack black's centre group at this point. Perhaps attack from the left instead and strengthen my centre group in preparation for an invasion of the lower side? Or is there a more important matter to deal with?

P: this is a hard question, you are indeed correct that this is a critical moment in the middle game.

Attacking the black group would be my priority.  How is difficult. An interesting principle I read for go is to attack while making profit in sente (have the initiative).

How to attack while making profit in this case?
 Let's see if I can give you some hints in the next few moves (actually you had a good idea in later moves).]
;B[kl];W[lm];B[km];W[ln];B[kn];W[jk];B[ii];W[nd];B[lo];W[jp]
C[This peep ultimately let me take profit on the lower side, but would cutting have been better?

P: yes your assessement seems correct. Cutting to split the black groups would be my choice. The battle would be hard for both sides but black has much more to lose than white.]

;B[hm];W[im];B[in];W[jn];B[il];W[jm];B[jl];W[hl];B[hk];W[gl]
;B[jj]C[P: in the end black connects to save his group while white gets compensation in the bottom.

It comes down to the endgame...];W[kj];B[mi];W[kk];B[mk];W[nm]
;B[ll];W[ik];B[hj];W[ij];B[hi];W[ji];B[ih];W[kf];B[mn];W[mm]

;W[pm];B[qn];W[pn];B[po];W[on];B[oo];W[bl];B[aj];W[nb];B[oa]
;W[rl]C[P: good, the sides are the biggest endgame plays now.]
;B[rm];W[sm];B[qo];W[so];B[rp];W[sp];B[rr];W[sq];B[rq]C[P: very nice.]

;B[sc];W[sd];B[fi]C[Allowing this was bad!

P: it seems your earlier move at E8 should have been at F11 instead while you had the initiative.]
;W[gi];B[ei];W[gj];B[eh];W[fg];B[gf];W[mg];B[lf];W[mh];B[if]
;W[le];B[hf];W[sn]C[P: as you point out later, K15 is the biggest move.
