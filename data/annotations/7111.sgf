C[Hello!

Thanks for the review!

I am playing black. I feel like i played this game pretty much to the best of my ability, and I felt ahead when the endgame began, but I made some mistakes in yose that probably cost me the game.

I think I noticed many of my endgame mistakes myself. Did I also make mistakes in the early to midgame? If I did they are probably the kind of mistakes I always make and just don't aknowledge, so it would be very helpful to point them out. Thanks!

[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer.  My comments will be marked this way.  This was a good game on both sides, with few mistakes and not much to comment on in the opening.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pp];W[od];B[dp];W[cn];B[fp];W[bp];B[cq];W[ck]
;B[mc];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd];B[oc];W[nc];B[nb];W[qe];B[nd]C[[EV\] Usually considered slightly better for W, but certainly playable.]
;W[rd];B[qk]C[Is this extension too wide, taking into account the white thickness?

[EV\] This looks like a good extension, since W will be slightly overconcentrated if he responds at R11, and B has no reason to fear a W invasion at R6 or R7.]
;W[kq];B[iq];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[qn]C[[EV\] I like Q6 a little better, since R9 is already low, but the difference is probably just a matter of tasts.]
;W[gc];B[cf]C[[EV\] Why not C15?  If W pincers, the attachment at C17 lets B settle fairly easily.]
;W[cd];B[ci];W[bq];B[nn]C[[EV\] What is the purpose of this move?  It seems a little vague.  When W responds on the side, he is very safe, so there is no attack.  Also, with the B stone already at R9 and the W thickness above, there is not much prospect for a large territory on the right side.]
;W[lo];B[ef];W[dg];B[df]C[[EV\] C13 is more usual, making a quick base on the side.  The W cut is not hard for B to handle.  This move would be nice if it prepared some invasion on top, say if the W stone at G17 was at H17.]
;W[bh];B[dh];W[cg];B[eg];W[bf];B[fi];W[eo]C[[EV\] I think this move helps B more than W, as it forces B to remove much of the aji at E3, and it does not provide any obvious benefit to W on the outside.]
;B[ep];W[qi];B[hd];W[hc];B[id];W[gd];B[ge];W[ic];B[jc];W[jd]
;B[jb];W[kd];B[if];W[kf];B[nf];W[kh];B[nh];W[me]C[[EV\] Aji-keshi again, save it for later.]
;B[ne];W[ig];B[hg];W[jf]C[I wasnt sure if its better to sacrifice my 2 stones and make a ponnuki or play the variation here, but I chose to sacrifice to get sente and simple result.

[EV\] Giving up two stones is large.  I think I would simply defend and keep up the attack.  J12 and R13 would be left as miai.  However, your way is certainly playable.]

(;B[ih];W[ie];B[jg];W[he];B[qg];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph];B[pi];W[oi]
;B[pj];W[oh];B[ri];W[ni];B[mh];W[mi];B[kg]C[[EV\] Pushing at M12 before cutting, or even cutting immediately with M11, leaves W a little weaker in the center.]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[kj];B[nk];W[mk];B[ml];W[lk]C[I feel I'm ahead now.

[EV\] Still looks even to me.]
(;B[nr];W[mr];B[or]
(;W[jr]C[[EV\] In positions like this, J2 is frequently better.  It is clearly better if B must hane outside, and if B captures the stone, W gets good shape and sente.]
;B[ir];W[is];B[hs];W[js];B[hq];W[lr]C[I was happy to see this slow move by w

[EV\] The aji of a B clamp here was serious, but I agree this is too slow.]
;B[ga]C[[EV\] Oops, this does not work ...];W[ib];B[ia];W[kb]
C[I hadn't read this properly, but I managed to avoid disaster.

[EV\] But if W had read a little deeper, it looks like M18 captures.]
;B[lb];W[kc];B[ka];W[ja]C[[EV\] Aji-keshi, actually helps B with his liberty problem.  Without this exchange, w has H19 ko possibility.]
;B[jb];W[cr]C[[EV\] B2 is a little better, since it  probably retains sente.]
;B[dr];W[cp];B[dq];W[do];B[ea];W[fk];B[cb];W[go]
(;B[be]C[After I played I noticed this is a bad variation

[EV\] Yes, this exchange was good for W.];W[ce];B[bd];W[bc]
;B[cc];W[ad];B[dd];W[ae];B[ec];W[de]C[[EV\] B18 might be a better use of this aji.  W can wait until later to decide, as B is unlikely to play here in gote anytime soon.]
;B[db];W[io];B[lm];W[km];B[hk]C[[EV\] G9 seems to get in a little farther.]
