C[Hi,

This is the first game I have played on the IGS go server. I played black, no handicap, komi : 6.5
maXima resigned but I still have some questions...
My opponent and me are quiet beginners :
- maXima : unranked on IGS
- youshe (me : youshe.jaalon@gmail.com) : 18k in France, unranked on IGS

The main points I'm working on :
- intuition,
- directions of play,
- mistakes I have done (bad shapes, missed big points, ...),
- others things like contact play (see later).

My opponent often played at contact. I know it's bad but I don't realy know what to answer.
Someone (maybe Fan Hui, Chinese 2p) said that a "bad" move may be good as soon as the opponent doesn't know how to punish it so, here's my problem :)

Thanks for your comment

Hi there!

I am an amateur Go player from St.Petersburg, Russia. My current rating on KGS is around 10K, and my personal record there is 8K (although without handicap 8Ks beat me heavily :) ).

This is my first review on GTL, so I beg pardon for my English, if any error occurs... I will mark my comments with the "~" separator.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk];W[ek]LB[fc:A][fd:E][cf:C][cn:D]
[fq:B]C[This move looked strange, but I don't realy understand the value of the next move to do :
Around A or B looked the best way but I was not sure to go for a high or a low move. I played at the top because of the gap at the top left but should I have made a high move at E ?
I didn't play C or D because I thought there were not enouth space. Is that the right feeling ?

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

So, the players choosed the parallel opening. The move (wE9) really looks strange for me, it can mean that:
1) either White is greedy (expects a territory there),
2) or White welcomes Black to invade (expects influence).

Both C and D invasions seem reasonable for me. C is even more comfortable, as it allows to enter the corner (or jump to C11). The resulting influence for White can be nullified by playing around K16...

Approaching at A or B allows White to stabilize his position by playing one more move on the left side ( C11 for instance ).]

(;B[fc];W[nq]LB[oo:A][op:B]C[I made the chinese opening to build a bit on the lower edge but the circled
I played A but maybe B looks like a better move. What is the classic answer to this ?

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

Both A and B seem ok for me. Pincering around L3 is also an option, but the overall position may become too low for Black. I would have played A here.]

(;B[oo];W[op]LB[po:A][pp:B]C[A or B ?
B looks strange but I don't realy know what to do. Perbabs A ? But it looks like a hard fight or a nice sure territory for white...

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

There absolutely nothing to think about. Black B is the only move, you should not care about the cut at A as long as White does not have reinforcements here.

Playing at A allows White to enter your position, putting in trouble the stone at Q3.]

(;B[pp]C[
~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

You made the right choice here :)];W[oq]C[
~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

Here, White makes a definite error. He makes an empty triangle, a bad form, which must be avoided. More important, this move does not prevent black from developing his P5 stone.

White should play at O5 instead...];B[on];W[gc]C[
~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

Another severe mistake for White, I think. The proverb says "Contact moves are NOT attack moves". Touching the black stone weakens BOTH stones, but now it is Black's turn to take the initiative. 

If White had the intention to pincer, he should have played  around J17.]
;B[fd];W[gd]LB[jc:B][fe:A][cf:C]C[maybe that was wrong or too early, but I don't realy know... What should I have played ?
- A, but white will have a nice wall,
- around B, but my two lone stones are weak and if whight answer at A, it looks bad for me...
- I played C but...

~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

Now its getting hot! The pair of black stones must be resqued whatever the cost is. The A move is good as it follows the proverb "Run before you live". The B move seems to me like abandoning the black stones. The C move seems to me like attacking, while having your rear undefended.

So I choose A. It is also an option to consider entering the corner with D17 move and then playing around C to make White  hoshi stone feel uncomfortable.

p.s. "Run before you live" says the proverb. But do not rely too much on the proverbs. I had a plenty of sutiations "Run, but then (damn!) you cannot live" :)]

(;B[cf]LB[ee:A]C[... my two stones are still lone and white should cut around A

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

White A launches a pretty double attack on both groups, so that you cannot save one without weakening the other. You should avoid such situations.]
;W[ce]
(;B[df]LB[ef:A]C[A would have been better, isn't it ?

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

I think that even after A White can still cause trouble (see the variation), but A is definitly better. The main idea here is that you should avoid making heavy groups inside the enemy's zone. 

Whenever you groups are light, you can easily sacrifice some parts to gain some greater profit. Whenever the group is heavy it can be too costly to sacrifice it.

I think that F14 and E13 moves are worth considering...];W[ee]
;B[fe];W[ef]TR[fc][fd][fe]LB[eg:B][ci:C][di:A]C[I wanted to play high at A but it looked bad and B sould be to dangerous for my three triangled stones so I played C

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

I see two options here: a tricky idea to enter the corner (D17 for example) and force White into a close combat, or maybe stabilize at least one group (the left one).

The C move allows the left group to survive, but you should be ready to sacrifice the marked stones...]

(;B[ci];W[bf];B[bg];W[be]LB[eg:B][ch:A][bi:C][ck:D]C[I played A but it looks bad.
I wanted to play B but it doesn't look nice and I was afraid of the cut but is was not working in fact
Now when I look C or D, it looks nice.
What was the best move ?

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

A is the worst move here, I believe. It leaves Black on the 3rd line, too low. Also it is gote, White does not have to answer directly.

B is ok. "Hane at the head of two stones", says the proverb.

C is just as good as A. It does not require White to make a direct responce.

D is another option, but it seems too low for me, crawling just on the 3rd line.

I can also recommend to tenuki here, switching attention to the bottom line. White's empty triangle just beggs to be attacked here, so I vote for a move around L4.]

(;B[ch];W[dg];B[cg]C[
~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

Here Black wastes a move to save a pair of stones. I would play more agressievly here, maybe at E13.]
;W[ed]LB[ip:A][jc:B][ck:C][qf:D][qc:E]C[
~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

White wastes a move either. A pass could bring more profit than this :)

White could play A, B, C, D or even E here to gain something. I would prefer A or C...]

(;B[ei]LB[eg:A]C[The cut at A doesn't look to work. It there a tesuji here I don't know ?
I didn't realy know what to play here. What do you think about the situation ?
In fact, the whole sequence looks strange and I still don't know what to do up to 39 to get a best result

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

The cut at A may work, because you threaten to save the 3 top stones (see the variation). It is too bad for White to afford it. So, the net may work.

The situation is complex for Black now. Black should ensure life for the left group and switch to the bottom side. I think it is important to move here before White.]
;W[dj];B[ej]C[
~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

Why not cutting at E13 now? It works perfectly now, allowing left group to escape to the center.]
;W[di];B[dh];W[eg];B[eh]C[
~~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

That worked too. The left black group seems to be safe now. Now Black has the option to tenuki at last...]
;W[cj]C[
~~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

I can see White's main mistake: he thinks that Go is all about life and death, while Go is mostly about territory and influence.

Usually, there is no direct need to kill enemy's weak group. Keeping pressure and gaining profit, while the opponent is trying to escape is just ok.

Here, White was desperate to kill black group, but more correct was to keep it eyeless, while gaining territory around it.

p.s. this move must be at C9 or D8, not C10...];B[dk];W[ck]
;B[dl];W[cl]C[here, maybe the wall was bigger than the territory, but...]
;B[dm];W[cm]
(;B[cn]LB[dn:A]C[... I should have played A and ...

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

I think, that starting a ladder with F9 is the best option here. The  proverb says "Kill the cutting stones". The ladder works (see the variation).]
;W[bn];B[do]LB[co:A]C[(miss click, I wanted to play A but this was not a good idea maybe)]
;W[co];B[dn];W[bp];B[fp]LB[fk:A][fp:B]C[... I should have caputured with A but if white had played at B, his territory would have been to big, isn't it ?
What was the best move here ?

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

A is the best option. You should not care of White territory, as you recieve a perfect wall instead. White large moyo is already rendered to void and it is humilating for White. After White B, you can use your powerful wall to attack the empty triangle in the bottom.

After Black B White should save the cutting stone at all costs.]
;W[fk];B[gi];W[gg];B[gf]LB[kq:C][jj:B][kd:A]C[
~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

I see no need in saving the top 3 stones any more. I think, that A, B or C worth more in this situation.

A prevents White from taking the initiative on the top.
B encircles the cutting stones at E9.
C launches a severe attack on the empty triangle.];W[ge];B[ff]
;W[fg];B[hf]C[Here, I'm totaly lost for a few moves];W[hg];B[id]
;W[ic]LB[jc:A]C[Was it possible to kill the white group after A or something like it ?

~~~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

There is no need to kill it at all. A move gains a territory on the side, while White group is still eyeless. That punishment is enough for White.]
;B[jd];W[jc];B[kc];W[if];B[he];W[fb];B[hc];W[hb];B[hd];W[gb]
C[~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

This move should be at E17...];B[jb];W[ib];B[lb];W[kd];B[jf]
;W[je];B[ke];W[ec];B[ld];W[ig];B[ie]C[Up to here, I feel it bad but I don't know how to get a best result...

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

You cannot feel bad about the situation now. You have escaped with the top group, you gained the half of the top side and you destroyed White influence.

The only probem for Black is the cut at E9. Black cannot allow White to save the cutting stones...]
;W[jg]C[
~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

White is wasting time. This move should be around J10 in a desperate attempt to save the cutting stones at E9. Also, J10 is a good base from which to reduce black moyo.]
;B[kg]C[
~~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

This is also incorrect. I would play at H9 to start a final fight for the cutting stones.

Black should not care for keeping his territories. White does not have any to this moment.]
;W[kh];B[ii]LB[lg:D][lh:C][ii:B][hk:A]C[maybe it's a bit early to defend because my group can still evade with white A or white B but it could give some nice prospects for the up right later but I should have blocked around C or D to enlarge and 'secure' the moyo

~~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

I vote for A. I've been crying to move at H9 for my last two or three comments :)

Black must not be desperate to protect his moyo. White does not have territory at all, his up-left corner is too pitifull for words...]

~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

There is nothing to improve in this sequence. White failed to protect the cutting stones. Black now lives unconditionally. The net at G7 was Black's ultimate move.]
;W[fq];B[hn]LB[qc:D][lp:C][gq:B][mh:A]C[
~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

The Black has just won The Battle For Cutting Stones. There is no need to check the battlefield for the left White soldiers and kill them one by one. Rally your troops and march into the White's capital!

Sorry. I mean, now you can turn your attention back to moyos and territory to win the game. I recommend A, B, C and D moves. B or C is most prefferable, as they prevent White from gaining territories as well...]

Thanks for the review.

~~~~~~~~~~~[ SadSido \]

Some final advices for both players:

1) Know the proverbs. They are the pure Go knowledge, heavily concentrated :) Let your first proverb be "Tenuki is always a good move" :)

2) Do not focus just on killing / saving stones. Some stones are not worth to be killed or saved. On the other hand, protect the cutting stones at all costs.

3) Protect your weak groups before you take big points or attack the enemy. Ensure life for every big group you create. Always consider the idea to sacrifice a small group.

Enjoy the game of Go,
