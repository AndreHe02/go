C[Hello reviewer

I am playing black in this game which i found very tough
My play is often too loose and quick and in this game I lost a large group because of this.

I like to try new plays and moves.
Mybe you could point out some good moves and ideas for me.

thanks,

(;B[qm];W[qq]C[You can see here that black's position is low and may disadvantage him for taking influence in the center later on. White is also low so he will also have troubles.]
;B[qr]C[I am not sure of the joseki here but I played how I feel and seemed ok]
;W[rq]
(;B[pp];W[po];B[oo];W[pm];B[ql];W[on];B[no];W[eq];B[iq]C[mybe e3 is bad because of this pincer?

Yes, in most situation, attacking from the inside is more difficult and troublesome.]
;W[cq]C[There are some possibilities here]
(;B[co]C[this fealt wrong here

Yes C5 is just too heavy and not doing anything much];W[bq]
;B[cl]C[white too good now?

He is better than black in my opinion in the corner. His group is secured and yours is still open to attack]

;W[be]C[not sure of answer here]
(;B[bf];W[de];B[cf];W[dd];B[df];W[ee]C[white too good?

Yes, black B14 was not a very good move in my opinion, it allows white to atari your stone at c15 and cut you apart, imagine white playing the sequence at p15 now :)]
;B[bc]C[trick play mybe -  see how white answer :)];W[bd];B[ec]
;W[fd];B[fc];W[gb];B[fe];W[gd]
(;B[ef]C[gote but lots of ko threats ..
so probably bad

E14 was the only move here so it was okay. White is going to push you over and reduce your influence/territory too much if not blocked.]
;W[pl];B[qk];W[cm]C[tricky to answer this
I could have gone b7 and connect which is mybe best since middle is not important here
Your thoughts?

D5 was not bad at all here. Making territory under white's stone at c7 is not a good idea because white will neutralize the influence that your wall at d14 makes.]

(;B[do];W[bl];B[ep];W[dq]C[Here you have a better option in my opinion]

(;B[ck];W[bk];B[bn];W[cj];B[bm];W[dl]C[did'nt read this ladder :(]

(;B[ej]C[seemed overplay by me.
I have a bad habit of making overplay when something doesnt work out and I try too hard to compensate.

Yes, white is not alive but neither are your group at d6. White's group is stronger so you have to enforce your group before attacking]
;W[ei];B[gj];W[fl];B[fm];W[fk];B[hm];W[fj]
(;B[gf]C[small but necessary?

Yes it's necessary because if not blocked, white will attack your group and push it while making a big influence in the center]

(;B[ad]C[gote, leave this till later?

I think its a good idea to connect, it gives black another eye and secures it for good. But maybe there are bigger moves that can help the same group]

(;W[oe];B[of];W[nf];B[qn];W[pn];B[el]C[wasted ko threat wasnt it.

Yes, there are still bigger points right now];W[ek];B[ie];W[pk]

p13 too big to ignore?
