C[Reviewed by shadow (IGS 3k) for white

Dear reviewer,

They keep telling you this thing about walls (it's better
to be on the outside and let the opponent live small
inside). In this game I tried to have it this way, but
with just one move (tengen, 47) my opponent
completely took the steam out of it. To my current understanding, 102 P5, engaging in a comparatively
minor fight, was a decisive error.

I did not add much of my own comment. I need some general explanation as to what's going on on the board,
and your assessment of the game at its various stages.

I'm trying not to, but so often I end up defending one
huge moyo. It's because I once used to be a sanren sei player. Is there anything I could do to change my style ?]

shadow: This was a hard game to review.  so many fundamentals are not yet understood by white, I don't know where to start.

Here are some things to think about.

1) White touches weak stones and makes them stronger
 a) touch stones to make them heavy (strong but you dont' care)
 b) touch stones to make them stronger (you were weak too and you got strong as well)
2) Study life and death in the corner, on the side, in the middle
 a) it takes 6 stones to live in a corner (6 ways)
 b) it takes 8 stones to live on a side (3 ways)
 c) it takes 10 stones to live in the middle (1 way)
Use your walls to make the area the opponent tries to live in, too small to make the live shape.  Thus he must run, chase him to
A) Make territory (you decide the direction you chase to make it)
B) Destroy territoyr (you direct the destruction
C) Kill him if he doesn't run fast enough.

good luck];W[dd];B[pq];W[pd];B[po];W[kq]C[shadow: L3 should be K3, split bottom, this move allows black to extend from D4 strengthing it while only allowing White a tiny base.]

(;W[gf]C[shadow:  white should make those black stones live inside this white area.  If they can't then they die big, if they can then white will have rebulit his strength to take territory elsewhere.]
;B[gg];W[hf];B[fh];W[hg];B[hh];W[hl];B[fj];W[eo]C[shadow: A lean on the 5-5 point?  This gives away too much territory.  White is hoping to gain strength to capture black in the middle.  this is the wrong way to be thinking.]
