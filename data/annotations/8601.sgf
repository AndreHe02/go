C[This is a game I played against a 1d player on the Tygem go server.  I have a few questions/comments, but please if you see anything else let me know.  It is a very close game, in the end I win by 1.5 points.  I think it is these close games that help me improve the most.

Hi, Philip, I am Bernd, HonFu here in the GTL and in other Go places. 

This time the two of us got matched, but actually we are not so far apart in strength (I am about KGS 3d), so I find it hard to identify real "mistakes". I'm going to share my thoughts with you anyway and hope they will help.]

(;W[qf];B[nd];W[lc]C[I think his invasion was too early.  The end result seems good for him however.  I'm not sure where I went wrong.

Hon: Yes, invading here looks a bit hasty. Probably he wants to make use of his wall.]

;W[qb];B[rf];W[rg]C[I think he made a mistake here, simply R13 would be better as it keeps me seperated, even though I can still live easily.

Hon. Yeah.];B[pf];W[mb]LB[ld:B][qg:A]C[Hon: So you made a kind of exchange, white lives within your sphere, you get thickness.

On the other hand, white can connect at A in sente and still has the cut at B to work with. Looks like white won on this exchange.]
;B[ch]C[Maybe B12 is better because of the nice follow up my opponent has.

Hon: I would not consider a raw peep a nice follow up. This move looks natural.]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[bi];B[bh];W[cm];B[fq]LB[cq:A][dq:B]C[Hon: I think you should consider A or B instead.

This move develops from a low-standing living group (lower right). Better to have the opponent placing useless stones there.]
;W[eq]LB[dq:A]C[Hon: I would have played A in his place. Why should he leave the corner open to invasion?]
;B[fp];W[ip]C[Hon: So he wants to attack. I would not try to fight him so much here on the lower side. You will not get territory from it, since it is your opponent who's standing left and right of the fight area, and it will therefore be him who gets the points. Rather aim at invading the corner (or just do so).]
;B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[cn];B[ep];W[dq]C[Hon: This whole sequence is ajikeshi. You can't enter the corner anymore.]
;B[hn]C[Hon: Now we see that you have no real way to profit from this fight. Instead white profited on the left side AND reduces the bottom.]
;W[lq];B[ir];W[gn]C[Weird move, not sure what his plan was here.

Hon: Mix it up. :-)]
(;B[go];W[gm]
(;B[hp];W[io];B[ho];W[hm]C[Hon: Now he's toothpasting you. Shapewise this should be good for you.]
;B[in];W[lo];B[kp]C[I think this peep was very good for me.

Hon: Why? You might capture two stones which are almost captured anyway. Will it be that much of a loss for white?]
;W[lp];B[jo];W[fn]C[Hon: Ugly. :-) I don't see why this peep is so important now. 

I would consider not answering. These two stones have no strategic function and after E6 he can still confine you. So rather take sente.]

;W[om];B[nm];W[kl];B[im]C[Hon: If you don't want to cut now, don't push here. Save it for later.]
;W[il];B[ee]C[Maybe this cut wasn't so good.  Hard for me to tell but I think the result wasn't terrible for me at least.]

;B[ei]C[I think this was a good exchange for me.  White can't cut this stone because it can link up to either group.  Also, it reduces whites framework and allows me to get some points as well.

Hon: As usual it is hard to get points in the center.];W[fi]
;B[ej];W[fj];B[bk]C[I think at this point I'm slightly ahead somehow.

Hon: If we just count points you could say so; but it's not so easy to estimate how many points will come of thickness, as the following sequence proved.]

;W[jq];B[iq];W[kq];B[jp];W[jr];B[os];W[ms]C[Hon: Okay, let us end here, since the rest of the game is yose.

There seems to be a bit of problems in every area of this game, like shape, direction, priorities, endgame, but one thing reoccurred constantly - you do ajikeshi too much.

Since I mentioned the places in the game I shall not repeat them here. But you should always try hard not to play a move that is not important right now. Just leave them - if they are sente you can play them later anyway.]

On the other hand the gap is very large, so maybe it's playable?

In my own games I hate to give my opponent influence, so maybe I am biased. :-)]

But if white looks too solid then it's probably the fault of the initial peep at C16 which strengthened your opponent.]
