C[hi,

I am Jouni, 5k KGS, 7kFI

I'll review for both sides.

You asked for help in direction of play.  I am not very strong in that, either, but I'll try to explain something about it.

Mostly, the game outcome was in the end decided by tactical mistakes, though.  Improving reading and fighting skills is perhaps more efficient than the direction of play concerns for you.

I hope these comments help.


Merry Christmas!];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[jq]LB[ce:A][de:B]
TR[dp]C[now, this black stone is suboptimal, and the first direction of play comment comes here:

Either A or B are big here, and much bigger than what black played.]

(;W[gq]TR[jq][mq]C[This move is OK, but there in not so much hurry with this, since black can simply extend to the other side, and come close to your other corner]
;B[mq]
(;W[oq]TR[de]SQ[cl][el][gl][cm][em][gm][cn][en][gn][do][eo]
[fo][go]C[This feels small.  If you instead consider the left side, you have actually now invested two stones in a loose wall, so you could think that something is cooking there.  Even more than with only the 4-4 stone in place.  D15 is still the move that helps there.

Direction of play is just trying to remember what you have already played, and play new stones so that they work together with the old ones.]
;B[cf]C[But now of course it is too late.  This is a good move.

Now black has built a similar influence on the top side, and white needs to intervene (as happened).]
;W[oc];B[kc]C[A good move, building a framework for black]
(;W[qc]LB[qg:A]TR[pp]C[This move feels a bit like a mistake in direction of play.

This way of course makes white live, but the variation looks better-

Here, direction of play and joseki knowledge are both needed.  White wants to build something around A or a wall facing towards the stone below.  This way the strength of the right bottom corner helps to make the right side whites.]

;B[co];W[cp]
(;B[cj]C[So far black has played the opening very well.

White has taken much more points than black, but black has lots of potential territory around, and the upper left black framework is huge.

White's opening can be thought of as slow, perhaps.

My advice for white in the opening is to try to look for places of extensions more.  In the beginning, D15, and later, D10 were really big points that white missed, playing more securely instead.]

[kh][ii]C[???

White should study a bit elementary life and death problems.

There is no room for an eye on the side.  A is a false eye, and three empty spaces means white can kill.

This game was in the end not about direction of play.  Instead, white allowed black to cut a big part from a group for free, and failed to kill a big group.  These are tactical mistakes, and more reading practice is needed, such as life&death problems.

It seems that the situation is not so bad at all.
