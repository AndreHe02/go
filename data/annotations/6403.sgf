C[[ZD\] I was black in the game, which I won by 0.5 points.  However, I made several moves that troubled me afterwards, and I felt lucky that my opponent was unable to fully exploit them; I would appreciate suggestions for better alternatives.  I will mark my comments and questions with [ZD\].]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[hc]
(;B[fq]C[[ZD\] I tenukied, as I did not like either of the two variations.

klin: It is the player's choice.  No problem.];W[dn];B[jp];W[od]
C[[ZD\] Here I was not sure.  Pincer does not seem to achieve much, and I did not like P17, although the variation suggests that it might be good, actually.]

(;B[pf]C[[ZD\] This seems to be a mistake, though, see the variation.

klin: Again, either move is OK.]
(;W[fd];B[ed];W[ee];B[ec];W[gd];B[dc];W[cd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb]
;W[bd];B[ab]LB[gb:A]C[[ZD\] Mistake, obviously.];W[ff]LB[po:A]
[pk:B][mc:C]C[[ZD\] Again, I was not sure what to do now. I considered A or B.  C seems to be small at this point.

klin: C is not a good choice now.  A or B may be slow.  Consider the possible next move for W.  W may play atG5, if B H4, W J6.  W can have a huge influence in the center.  Therefore, B can consider a move in the center.  Even, invade the left side by D7.]
;B[cl]LB[cl:A]C[[ZD\] In the end, I tried to do something about whites left-side moyo.  Is A the right way to do this, or is there some better choice?

klin: This move is also possible.  A little too deep though.  That's why I suggested D7.]
;W[cj];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[dl]C[klin: W let B settle down too easily.]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[bj];W[bi];B[ci];W[dj]
(;B[bk];W[ch];B[cq]LB[fq:A]C[[ZD\] This might be a mistake, as it weakens A.

klin: C3 is huge in territory.  Hurting A a little bit is the small price to pay.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[pn]C[klin: B is successful.];B[cn]
;W[do];B[dm];W[em];B[fo];W[gp];B[fp];W[fn];B[gn]LB[go:A]C[[ZD\] Just playing A would give less weaknesses.

klin: Yes.];W[gm];B[hm];W[hl];B[gl];W[fm];B[im];W[hk]
(;B[mc]C[[ZD\] I was not sure what to do now.  Probably something in lower left corner is more urgent.

klin: LR corner is more urgent.];W[qq];B[qr]LB[qp:A]C[[ZD\] Submissive. but the variations for A give white nice position to the left.]
;W[qp];B[np]C[[ZD\] A mistake, I have too many weaknesses on lower side for this move to make any sense.]
;W[qj];B[ne]LB[or:A]C[[ZD\] I probably had to fix with A, instead.

klin: No, O14 is bigger now.];W[rr]C[[ZD\] This looks like a mistake to me.  It is definitely big, but it allows me to fix some of the weaknesses of the lower side.]
;B[pr];W[lq]C[[ZD\] Still, this looks unpleasant.  I felt lucky to get away with as little damage as I did in the end.]
;B[lp]C[klin: B can play at K3 and chase W out to fight.];W[kp]

;B[ip];W[go]C[klin: W has gained a lot.];B[qh];W[qi];B[rh];W[qc]
;B[rc];W[pk];B[jg]LB[od:A]C[[ZD\] I am not sure about this move.  However, I feared white could threaten to run with A, and use this to create a wall enclosing large territory in the center.

klin: This move OK. No comment beyond this point.];W[hr];B[fr]
C[klin: Did you consider G3 cut?];W[hq];B[dr];W[jr];B[ir];W[is]
;B[ks];W[io];B[js];W[hh]C[[ZD\] This was a mistake from white -- too small and does not really achieve anything.]

(;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[kc]LB[po:B][fc:A][ec:C]C[[ZD\] Now jumping out with A looks silly, as it only builds whites left side.  The san-san invasion seems to give white nice formation on top.  I would like to tenuki and play B, but the attack starting with C seems too severe to ignore it.]
