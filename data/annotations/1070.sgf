;W[ce];B[ee]C[If White wishes to avoid complications, White should play the joseki starting with "b".]

(;W[fd]C[With White 14, we enter the chapter (of Ishida's Dictionary) entitled "Taisha: The Difficult Variations". My general rule is to avoid this sort of thing entirely. Once amateurs play this way, they might as well be gambling - the outcome is so uncertain.]
;B[cc];W[cf];B[ef]C[Freedman: I don't believe White 18 is joseki, but is it good, bad, or so-so?

White "b" is joseki. "A" is bad because it is slow and heavy.]

(;W[cg];B[gb];W[hd]C[Shape-wise, Black 21 seems better at "b".]

(;B[gg]MA[ci]C[Freedman: White 22 leaves 8, 14, 20 exposed.  I'm interested in different continuations and commentary on the ensuing battle.

Black 21 was a little poor on shape, so may allow White to play on the left side rather than the top. But since White plays on the left, Black can look forward to splitting the top, perhaps starting with an approach to the upper right corner.

White "b" is the usual move for the joseki position that most resembles this position.

White "a" seems to lack purpose. It doesn't put much pressure on the Black center. It doesn't create territory, as it is easily undermined. For life, a move on the third line seems better. This would make a solid position and allow White to fight like mad on the top. White might even be best off playing really lightly up top and abandoning something after White "a". So I think White "a" is a mistake. If White plays up top, however, Black may check severely at the marked position. But Black's position is thin enough that White should be able to survive this.]

(;W[dj];B[jd]TR[ed][fd][hd]C[White's marked stones are looking real bad. White either needs to settle the position or play very lightly, possibly sacrificing. Black stands to gain some nice influence if White starts thrashing around. An attachment like White "b" might do the trick of settling the position - forcing Black to either capture a small group of White stones, or let White escape.]

(;W[hf]C[If Black "b", Black cannot come out poorly.]
(;B[eh]C[White can now play on the upper side, at "b" for example. Black 25 is not absolute sente (see one variation following White "b").]

(;W[dh];B[jf];W[hg]C[Now Black gets his way, having played at 27.]
;B[gi];W[hi];B[hj];W[ii]TR[hj]C[My sense is that Black should connect at "b". See variations. Playing at "c" is tempting, hoping to sacrifice the marked stone, but this doesn't work. See variation.]

(;B[gk]C[White 34 is a mistake, serving no purpose other than to make White heavier. It is also aji-keshi. And loss of sente!]
;W[gh];B[fh];W[hh]C[Black should not defend at "a" here. I like "b", for example.]

(;B[ek];W[kh]TR[jd][jf]C[Freedman: I thought Black 39 was a mistake.  While it was big it enable me to take pressure off my weak center group by pressuring Black's upper right group, get a little territory at the top, and get a little thickness on the outside.

Yes. I like "b", which works in combination with the two marked stones. If Black wishes to play on the bottom, it seems that "c" works better with Black's center influence. It is not clear to me that directly attacking the White stones is productive at this moment.]

(;B[nq];W[hb]C[Why not Black "b"?]
(;B[fb];W[mc];B[me];W[ic]TR[jf][jd][me]C[I think Black "b" is lighter here. Black does not want the marked stones to get heavy.

I do not like Black's overall position here, and I do not know where to play. Abandoning the three marked stones seems big, but running with them seems a sure way to lose. I think Black's best strategy now is to seek complications in the upper right, in an effort to settle things without letting White get too much territory and profit without compensation. Therefore Black should be aiming for light play, and perhaps thinking of attachment moves.]

(;B[mg];W[mi];B[pf];W[pi]C[Black "a" seems to be a mistake. Black should consider attaching so as to settle the situation. "B" is perhaps a reasonable start, but I have not read carefully here.]

(;B[ie];W[jc];B[he];W[ge];B[gc];W[gf];B[kc];W[kb];B[lc];W[lb]
;B[qe]C[Freedman: I ignored 59, and again 71...???
   I do not know what White is thinking. White "b" is huge. Not only for profit, but the Black group is still threatened. "B" is urgent.]

(;W[lq]TR[eq]MA[lp][pn][kp]C[With the marked stone present, I question White's choice of joseki. Any of the marked moves, or even "a", seems reasonable.]
;B[no];W[pn];B[kp];W[lp];B[lo];W[kq];B[jp];W[jq];B[ip];W[hq]
;B[qd]C[Freedman: I ignored 59, and again 71...???    With 71, Black has settled himself in the upper right, so a move here is no longer urgent, just big. The actual move at 72 is quite large.]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[go]C[If Black was going to ignore 74 then he should not have played 73.]
;B[pc]MA[gd][nb]C[Freedman: Was 76 necessary?

The marked stones seem to be miai. Therefore 76 should be at one of the huge points on the lower side. "B" seems best. "C" and "d" are possible.]

(;W[md]C[Freedman: 77 was huge.  I was a little worried about security at the top [when I played 76\].]
;B[cp]C[White 78 allows Black to settle too easily (perhaps by sacrificing three or more stones). Black is leading now, so White must aim for large-scale complications. I like "b".]

(;W[mo]C[Freedman: Sequences following 78?  I had no idea what to do here.]
;B[qq]C[I think Black 79 is the right idea to seal the win.]
;W[pq];B[mn];W[mp];B[rp];W[qr];B[rr];W[qp];B[rq]C[White 88 is petty, allowing Black a chance to sacriifice three stones to seal the win. "B" is much better. "C" appears to be double-sente; I think it should be played immediately.]

(;W[ko];B[ln];W[io]MA[dk][pr][rn][gd][nb][dm][ik]C[Both players suddenly seem to have lost complete track of the global picture. Look around at some of the marked points for inspiration.]
;B[jo];W[hn];B[jn];W[cl]TR[jn][jo][ip][jp][kp][lo][ln][mn]C[Freedman: With 94 I took territory and kept pressure on the center Black group.

It is big, but I think with the marked stones to run to, it does not put much pressure on the Black group. White 94 is still a very good mowe.]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[gr];W[hr];B[ri]C[Freedman: I thought Black 99 was big, but 100 exploits a weakness between two Black groups in the center?

I think White should do something to forestall a Black play at "b". White 100 is definitely sente. I think it is a reasonable play to settle the situation. I'll show a more reasonable continuation than what actually happened. Perhaps time was running out.

If White is looking to "exploit a weakness between two Black groups in the center" then consider "C", "d", or "e". These initiate vicious fighting, which may be the only way for White to win (barring the incredible stroke of luck that actually befell him).]

(;W[ij];B[ik];W[jk]C[Black wins immediately by playing at "b".]

No. White "b" is sente against the corner and also threatens to connect.]
