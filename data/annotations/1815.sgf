GC[Game played at IGS. This is my first time using a SGF editor.]


;B[pp]C[Hi, this is my first posted game here, a game I played at IGS a few days ago. I'm currently 6k there, and my opponent was 5k, so I had black, playing by no komi. I lost this game by 9.5 points, but it was a close one with the lead fluctuating several times until I finally blundered near the end. I don't think white's early fuseki was very good, but failed to take advantage of it. My main focus is the early top-side fight and the lower-side fight during the middle game. OC, I'm waiting you to scold me plenty for any other crude play :-).

> The main problem in this game is that you did not defend your weak group properly. Nothing strategic, mainly tactical problems. You made quite a few shape mistakes in this game, perhaps shape is an area where you can improve a lot then! Tesuji problems will be useful for that. Also, perhaps you could practise not to let your opponent hane on top of your stones too much, and play less hane yourself to leave fewer cutting points. As for the game, it got quite nasty in the middle :) As a result, I couldn't comment that much, because both sides made a lot of mistakes there. On the good side, I don't think you have to worry about your opening ideas.

> I've also tried to put some comments in your own variations. I noticed that you sometimes pick worse moves for white than you normally pick for yourself. Be careful about that, when reading you must read the best moves for your opponent too.]
;W[dp]C[When I run into moves which I'm not quite confident of rather it's good or bad, I will explain you why I made such decisions, and if you find those decisions unreasonable, please tell me. OC, most of them will appear bad :-)]

(;B[pc]C[I'm trying out the Chinese opening these days. My favorite opening is r16 and then q10 as a follow-up, and then if white comes p17, respond at p15, if  white p16, then q14. Somehow, I hardly find the pros play this way. is it bad?
> It is very hard to call something bad in fuseki. It certainly won't lose you a game. It is much better for you to try out moves in the opening than to play the same boring moves all the time. Especially, try it against stronger opponents, playing "non-standard" moves helps there.]
;W[dc];B[qi];W[nc]C[I don't think this was a good approach, black can easily gain much by pincer attack

> Actually, just playing Q15 is also good here. Then white will be very close to a strong shimari after L17. See variation]

(;B[lc];W[ld];B[kc];W[md];B[pe];W[hc]C[don't like this, either

> You will have to prove it wrong though :) Given black's strong position on the right, it may not be good, but you have to work on it..]
;B[je];W[lf];B[jg];W[lh]
(;B[gd]C[I thought it was time to strengthen my group. I considered g15 & f17as alternatives for this move, not sure for g16 because of h16, but decided g15 too loose and f15 will invite dual-attack, so I chose this one. MaybeG15 was better, having f17 and L11 as a follow-up. Which move was the best for the moment?

> The shape at G16 looks very thin. There is a  potential cut at K17 that you have to be careful about. I've given some variations.]
;W[hd];B[ge];W[gc];B[fc]C[> This is a BIG overplay :) The game could be over immediately. See variation.]

(;W[fb]C[> very submissive move by white. not good.];B[ec]LB[he:A]
C[> black is asking for trouble. If white plays A now, black will die somewhere, as before. black E17 is not important. A is the vital point to connect the black stones.]
;W[eb]
(;B[dd]C[> This is a slow move. Hane is too slow here, it lets white play double hane. See variation.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ce]TR[aa][ba][ca][da][ea][fa][ga][ab][bb][cb]
[db][gb][ac][bc][cc][ad][bd]SQ[ed][fd]C[> The last moves were terrible for black.  Compare the territories both players made with these moves. And black did not make any thickness out of it.]
;B[lj]LB[he:A]TR[ii][ji][ki]C[Maybe L11 was better than this move, since I have to worry less for the black group.
I played m10 to insure the connection of k15 group in sente, and also gain some nice moyo by attack. My plan was to construct main territory at the right and lower side, and considered the function of the g15 group as an interruption of white's development at the left side, so just thought if it can avoid severe attack, that would be enough. I thought it was a nice plan at that point, but later on I became skeptful of it.(I'll explain it a few moves after.)  Maybe i was too optimistic, and didn't regard whites possible resistances. And I must have been underestimating the weaknesses of d14 and h15.(Actually I thought If i can cover the h15 weakness, then d14 will be no big deal, so didn't worry much about it.) Was the white group weak enough to attack?

> That is not the point actually. The point is, your own group is far too weak to play such an attack. If white runs in the direction of the marked points, he will run over your group, and can the cut you to pieces. Black still has to play A. If white defends his weak group, you can just play F3 or another big point (such as D14!)]

(;W[ki];B[kj];W[ji]C[However, my plan was based on the assumption that white will try to escape to the left. What if white played more positively, like playing around j14 first and then try to settle on the right, destructing my territory? Then later on, attack the splitted f17 group.. then maybe my plan could have turned into disaster.  I wonder what could have been the best plan for white here.(one possible variation from move 30)

> White's moves are good. White is running over your group and is getting ready to cut it to pieces (surround first, then kill)]

(;B[hh]LB[he:A]C[This must have been a mistake. I thought this would cover the h15 weakness, but  as it turned out, it didn't. But if I just connect at h15, then white o10 or p10 will be too painful. So maybe m10 was not a good move(L11 or just simply h15 might have been better than m10). Or do I have any other good response at this point?

> It is getting very difficult. A is still a good point, but it is getting very slow to play there, see variation]
;W[jj]C[white is aiming a cut at h15, then attack the whole group, but...]
;B[lm]C[I decided it was time to fight so I resisted. I thought it will be too painful to allow white to play around k7 or p10, anyway.

> P10 is not good. You can answer at O11 or somewhere around there and cut off that stone. White would probably just play K8. So M7 is not that important. Also, even if you lose M10, you only lose two stones. How much will you lose if white captures the top group?]
;W[he]C[> Ouch!];B[gf]C[I'm in big trouble. I considered of connecting at  j14, but that will invite a serious dual attack and it seemed at least one of my groups will die, so I just chose this one, leaving unlikely hopes for the k15 group to live inside..

> Normally, the game is over after this.];W[if];B[kg];W[lg]
;B[ih];W[jf];B[ke];W[kf];B[mb]C[> This move is bad. You cannot live in there. If you want to play at the top, play P18 instead to make more territory in the corner. If white plays O18, your group at the top dies and you will lose points when white jumps into your corner]
;W[nb];B[mc];W[od];B[ib];W[hb];B[kb]C[> This group can be killed quite easily..]

(;W[pd]C[> Instead of this, white could kill the top. Then black still needs to play Q16. Next white will play D14. The game is over.]

;B[kd];W[id];B[jb];W[la]C[> This is a huge loss.];B[ma]C[> Mistake. White can play elsewhere now, so you die in gote! See variation.]

(;W[ia];B[na];W[ob];B[pb];W[oa];B[gq]C[I lost so much at the top, so I had to occupy most of the bottom and right side. Considered c6, too, but decided this was better.

> Yes, this side is much better. Not only is the left side open at the bottom(B13), but you already have M7 on the board.]
;W[cn]
(;B[qq]C[Was this a good move? I considered p3, q3, r4, r5 as othr candidates, but gave up p3 and r5 because of s5 and p2. Didn't like q3 and r4, too, because they had only one-side influences. I was trying to aim both sides, so I chose this one, but maybe it's too corner-biased. If I played q3 or r4, which one would be better? the proverb goes, "play on the wider side", and q3 is the wider, but isn't this a bit too wide? I mean, if  you play q3, it's more likely you'll lose both sides, but if you play r4, at least you will have one side. In the early game, when territiry is not cleary decided so influence has a lot to do, I can agree easily with q3, but in a situation like this, I'm not sure...

> Why did you not consider Q6 ? or O4 ? In any case, R3 looks interesting. It makes the game more ambiguous. Since you are behind, maybe it's not so bad.]
;W[iq];B[kq];W[eq]C[I don't think this move was good, but is it? I think white's plan was to attack g3, and while g3 escapes, j3 will run into black's territory and live. If I'm not a weak player, is this a reasonable plan? Since g3 attacks first, and can steer the white group towards the thick black stones,  while g3 can easily escape towards the h12 group, I thought it wasn't a good idea, but anyway, I'm the weaker player, and if I fail to capture, it can be a disaster...
To my surprise, it was very hard to decide the next move.

> It takes a lot of territory, but white J5 does look more natural.]
;B[ho]C[Was this good? it has a serious weakness at h4n, and j5 is also difficult to response. This situation occurs a lot in my games, but I still don't know how to handle it properly. how should I play without creating weaknesses, and also prevent white from escaping?

> It is unusual, because white can play G2 to connect normally... H4 is the stronger version of the move. However, in this position, G2 doesnt work (variation). So H5 must be judged by how good an attack it provides..]

(;W[io]C[Hard to respond.. How should I play?];B[in]
(;W[hp]C[> This white move is a very heavy. See variation.]
;B[gp];W[go]C[> Wrong side atari. Very dangerous, as white soon finds out :)]
;B[hn];W[fo];B[hq];W[ip];B[ir];W[jr]
(;B[jq]C[If white cut at h2, I would have to resign, but both sides were misreading the situation. I thought I had more liberties than white, and probably my oppenent did so, too.

> Actually, white read correctly and you misread :) See variation]

(;B[no]C[> No need to be in a hurry to cut there. It's a lot of profit, but if you play P7 instead, you can attack the whole group. White has no time to connect there!]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[ql]C[> Black has made more here than white made at the top.]

(;B[pm]C[> Maybe play from the other direction..];W[pl]C[I considered cutting at p7, but was afraid that will isolate r11 by the sequence p7-p8-o8-o9-n8-s14, so I didn't. I'm not sure if I made the correct decision.]

(;B[qn]C[> Bad shape. After P7, black can capture Q7 in sente.]
;W[om];B[rf]C[I considered p9 instead, but since white can capture q7 in sente I thought it wouldn't have much effect. Playing on the left side might have been bigger(since r11 has s14 and o10 as options), but I thought this move will still gain some influence on the white p7 group. I think I was wrong. But in scale itself, which one is better? s14 or c8?]
;W[qo];B[po];W[oj];B[hk]C[I was a bit concerned of the cut at k7, and thought this was better than c8 since c8 alone has some weaknesses. k9 is also a nice follow-up. But this leaves white c9 as a very good spot, so I'm not sure which was the better. I always have trouble with judgement :-(
