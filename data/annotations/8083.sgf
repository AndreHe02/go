Hi, I'm Mike, (TakokaT on KGS), and I'll be reviewing for you. As for your opening comment, I don't think its because you've only been playing for 8 months that can't reach single kyu digits. Of course, the more you play, the better you'll be,  but if you keep training and analyzing your games, along with a healthy dose of life and death problems, you'll move right up the kyu ladder.]
;B[qd]C[what are my strongpoints and weakpoints? what do i have to improve to reach single kyu diglits? because i keep reaching between 9-11k. Is it because i dont have enough experience because i have been only playing go for about 8 months]

;W[qp];B[po]C[Is this a good move here if not what is?

I think this is okay, w's followup seems very threatening, but he is leaving his corner group pretty weak. I think you should attack it instead of attaching to w near his strong stones]
;W[ql]
(;B[pl]C[i think w liked to see this move, as it gave him a good sequence in sente.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[pn];B[on];W[qm];B[op]C[here you have to protect your cut. while this seems to accomplish two goals at once (attacking and defending the cut) it's not a very potent attack. If you attacked him before attaching, you would have benefited much more.]
;W[oq]
(;B[ok]C[Also, I don't think I like this move very much, it seems to be protecting one stone that isn't doing very much while leaving cutting points for w to take advantage of.]

(;B[lm]C[was this a good move? or should i have played this move before playing at m3

I think M3 is a bit of a mistake as it was not sente against the corner group. It is sente to take some territory, but w is correct to try and attack your weak group. Perhaps you overestimated the strength of the group, and tried to attack. Instead, you should spend M3 securing your shape, and helping your group to live.]
;W[ln];B[no]C[good, protect the cut.];W[lp];B[lr];W[mp];B[np]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[nn];B[ml]TR[pl]SQ[lq][lr]C[At this point, w has done a good job keeping b eyeless and under attack. because of this he will profit along the top edge, destroying some of your potential moyo. The culprit moves are marked. The squared stones were territorial, and not very big. They should have been focused on fixing the shape of your group. The triangled stone would have been better spent attacking the corner more severely.]

[eg][ch][dh][eh]C[This move is pretty small, and w should ignore it immediately. Luckily for b, w accepted this as sente. w should tenuki to more important areas (marked). Somewhere in the general triangled areas, I'm not sure exactly where.]
;W[js];B[hs];W[jr];B[fp];W[fo];B[ep];W[do];B[in]C[Once b gets this move, i think w should tenuki, as his prospects of territory are very slim.]

;W[im];B[jo]TR[jp][kp][jq][kq]C[This is pretty small, and w should ignore it. w will not make much territory here as b has stones right next to it. (the triangled stones are going to be dame +/- 1 pt. This is a very small move.]
;W[jp];B[gf]C[Good, you got this area first. I have a tough time deciding between playing high like this, and playing low like at G16. But its good that you found the right area.]

Correct, C14 looks better. However, even this move is not bad, I think w should still die.]

Yes, you're finding the right moves. Sometimes its hard to put your training into practice, but you will learn more and more by playing.]

Yea, you made a misread. It looks like a blitz game, so misreads will happen. Just do more life and death problems and these things will fix themselves.]
