C[Hello!

There were no great fights or weak groups in this game, so it seemed to be decided by our judgements of value.
I play as white and end up winning by a relatively small margin, but I felt unsure about how to deal with my central moyo toward the end.

I would appreciate all comments but especially on my judgement of value and yose.

Thanks so much!

[NM\] I shall be reviewing your game. I will try to help with judgements of value and the yose as you requested.]

Black would build up more influence if white played m3 

Mybe it is slightly too early to reduce this now?

I play L16 to create a central moyo, but I didn't expect black's response.

[NM\] N17 is very good, and white should have seen this. The white wall now looks like a bad choice.

Not sure what the other options were];W[kd]C[amego [4k\]: be back in 3 min.
Tangerine [4k\]: okay

[NM\] I personally like territory over making a moyo so I cannot say I like this move! 

It is an interesting move and the centre looks like being a white territory unless black can reduce.]

[NM\] I thought you played quite well to win after black getting mybe the better position after the opening.

Your yose, could do with the most improvement i think! Especially try to make most of the sente moves you can before playing the biggest gote move!

You made some good shapes and you had generally good judgement about centre territory.

The opening was not too good for white, so mybe try study some opening / joseki to make the whole board work for you (such as using your walls)

Hope this review helps! I am a bit rusty at go nowadays.

Thanks for sharing this game.
