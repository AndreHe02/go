Comments are marked "al>"

Nearly all my games end the same: I'm OK in the opening, get in loads of trouble in the middle game, and sometimes manage to save the day in the endgame... in this case I didn't.
So I'm trying to understand more of middle game strategies. That would be great if you could concentrate on that part.
Thanks already for reviewing that game :-)

;B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[cj];W[qj];B[qg];W[nq];B[ho]C[al> Since much of the ensuing play focuses on the center of the board, one could argue that the mid game starts here, even though corners and sides a far from settled, as the territory is only loosely outlined this far. All four corners are still open for invasion. The safest potential territory at this point is white's along the lower right side.

al> This move is too high (on 5th line) to be an invasion - it will just help white build territory - and too low to build a black moyo in the center. Black could play K3, expecting to run out (K5, K7) into the center, to make a dent in white's potential territory along the bottom. Another possibility, being more consistent with the influence-focused opening (D16, K16, Q16), would be a bold K10.]

;W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[nm];W[jj]C[al> White made the mistake of first pushing against the black stones, making them stronger, and only the jumping into the center. The K10 stone is pretty lonely now. A better way to reduce black's potential center territory would be to play O10, where the white stone would have support from the friend at R10. That would be quite enough, in additino to invading the upper corners (and reinforcing the lower ones) to win. Territory in the center is frightenly hard to achieve.]
;B[nk]C[I think I made my first big mistake here. Defending around G10 would probably have got me into less trouble.

al> No, O9 is not bad, as it crosses the line of sight between the white center stone and the white stones to the right. It is a severe attack against the K10 stone - it has no friends to run to.]
;W[ei];B[ej]C[al> Contact play strenghens both parties. D12 or C13 would prevent white from darting towards the side, at the same time as building black potential territory along the left.]
;W[fi];B[dg];W[eg];B[jg]C[al> This is good, reducing the area for white to make eye space at the same time as outlining a black moyo in the upper right.]

;W[kl];B[oi]C[al> This is good, cutting line of sight between the white stones. White is in trouble now.]
;W[hm];B[il]C[When should I have defended that group? I'm afraid I didn't realize it was in such a danger before it was too late.
I wonder if I shouldn't have given up these stones at that stage. Saving them costed me a lot in other parts of the board.

al> Black may have felt like defending, but, as often is the case in Go, hunter and pray often switch in the blink of an eye. Black is actually doing a fairly good job hunting the white center group.]
;W[hl];B[ik];W[ij];B[hk];W[gl];B[gj];W[fj];B[gi];W[gk];B[hj]
;W[im];B[jl]C[al> Black L9 instead would save the next black move for something more useful.]
;W[hg]C[al> Black can cut at J12 to enclose white's center group.]
;B[kk];W[ih];B[he];W[fm]C[al> White's group in the center is not safe yet. B F12 would cause headache for white.]
;B[dl];W[io];B[jn];W[in];B[ni]C[al> B O11 is unnecessary. The black center group is alive, and it is more important to either secure the upper corners, or prevent the connection of the white center group to the white stones at the left.]
;W[gh];B[fd]C[al> F16 is not enough to protect the corner. In this case, D17 or C17 would be better.]
;W[cc]C[I thought that invasion couldn't work because of F16, and it seems I was right. Could have white played it better?]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb]C[al> White should go the other way and play B16 instead, to live. As stated before, both upper corners are open for invasion, which makes it possible for white to destroy enough points to prevent black from winning.]
;B[fb];W[ea];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[ba];B[ab];W[be];B[bd];W[ce]
;B[de];W[df];B[cf];W[ef];B[cg];W[nc];B[oc]C[I'm pretty sure I should have handled that invasion better... Sould I have played Q17 instead?

al> This is actually OK, since there are black stones to the left of O17. White is too crowded to make life here. Or rather, white shouldn't have made life here. A white invasion at R3, on the other hand, would have been uncomfortable for black.]
;W[nd];B[lc]C[al> M17 good. P18 could also be an option.];W[qc]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od]C[al> Black shold not be afraid of playing P18 here. After W P16, B S17, white's corner group has one liberty less than the black P17 group.]
;W[ob]
(;B[ne]C[al> Black is giving up too easily. B O16 forces white to live contained in the corner, or get both groups killed. Now, white destroys maybe 25+ points instead of 10+ points for black.]

;W[pj]C[al> White would have more to gain by playing S11. It is easy to overlook the fact that territory along the side is larger than what the eye sees, because of the fact that the first line is points, too. In the beginning, the center tempting as it appears to be a vast area of potential points. However, they are very hard to secure.]
;B[pi];W[bn]C[al> This settles the game, as white's lower left corner is not possible to invade any longer.]
