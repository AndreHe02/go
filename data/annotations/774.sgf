.];B[po];W[dj]C[.];B[jq]LB[fq:a][dn:b][jp:c]C[I think this is too conservative.  I would prefer Ba, Wb, Bc.  For W to pincer Ba would not be attactive withthe B shimari to the right.]
;W[jd];B[ld]LB[md:a][nd:b]C[Overly ambitous.  hodlign back to 'a' would be better.  this leaves an invasion point at 'b' and so does not really help to expand the side.]
;W[qi];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[eq]C[This move contradits the flow of the game so far.  this is obviously a moyo game as all the stones are high.  But this move allows B to get the outside.]
;B[fo];W[ep];B[go];W[dm];B[fd]LB[fc:a][pj:b][cc:c]C[Unusually, and rarely a good play.  'a' is the usualy appraoch, but in this game I would play 'b' to expand the moyo.  With the invasion at 'c' avaialble to B, W cannot hope to mathc the moyo which Bb would give.]
;W[cf];B[ff];W[jf];B[qf]LB[nd:a][qc:b]C[There is an unfinished jumping contest going on in the middle   Anyway, this is the wrong side.  B should appraoch W10 from the other side to expand te moyo..  With invasion points at 'a' and 'b' B cannot hope for much here.]
;W[me];B[md];W[le]C[These two moves destroy all the aji of the corner, yet do very little for W.  They are heavy and give B 20 pts of secure territory. These could very well be were the game was lost.]
;B[nd];W[ql];B[qn];W[ge]LB[dg:a]C[I prefer a gentle surroundign move like 'a', which secured territory while putting pressure on B]

LB[rm:a][mh:b][ro:c]C['a' wold be better.  If B responds to it W can play 'b'.  If B jumps to 'b', W can play 'c'.  Either way, B lives on the side.  This move is purely defensive]
