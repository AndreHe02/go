C[J: Hi, my name is Jorik Mandemaker and I've reviewed this game. I have marked all my comments with a J. In case I use some terms you don't understand you can look them up at senseis library (http://senseis.xmp.net)]
;B[pc]C[In this game, I felt, I played a very strong fuseki, but somehow it all fell apart.  A lot of my games resemble this, where I will have large areas mapped out, but somehow they always fall apart in the end....
thus without further ado.];W[dp];B[cd];W[pq];B[po];W[qo];B[qn]
TR[pc]C[here I've chosen a joseki that'll work nicely with my stone there...]
;W[qp]
(;B[pn]C[J: I think it's better to play at Q7. See the variation]
;W[qe]C[This gives me the perfect excuse to make an extension, and pincer at the same time....

J: Yes. White should finish the joseki with O3 first.];B[qh]
C[oopsie [11k\]: how do i set game up?  im new to site.

J: Allthough a litte far from the R6 stones this is a good dual purpose move.]
;W[oe]C[pooishness [14k\]: oh, you hit custom game.
oopsie [11k\]: oh..havent tried that.  thks];B[nd]CR[qk]C[I am aware of the weakness there, but I was betting he wouldn't be aggressive, and would secure life by taking the corner instead...

J: If white plays R9 now it would lead to a crazy fight. But one that's better for black then white.]
;W[rc]C[pooishness [14k\]: water's boiling...
pooishness [14k\]: I'll brb.];B[jc]CR[qk]TR[nd][pc]C[ok... this extension here instead of  my weakness at the circle.
again, I was betting he won't attack the circle, and i wanted to make sure there are no more attacks on the top side.  As for shape, I wasn't sure whether i should've been closer to my triangle stones, or if I should've slapped down k-16 instead...

J: K17 is perfectly allright. L17 or K16 would also have been good.]
;W[cj]
(;B[nq]C[J: This move isn't so good. It leaves an obvious weakness at P4. P3 is much better. See the variations.]
;W[jq]TR[op]C[Here I see a white moyo building.  I understand that my wall is still weak here , but I figure the earlier I attack the better.

J: Don't confuse invading with attacking. If you invade you'll get attacked rather then do the attacking most of the time. 

Allthough it might make you feel in controll of the game usually you'll be on the defensive.]
;B[gq]CR[ch][ec][ed][fc][fd][oh]TR[cn][cq][fq]MA[dk][ej][ip]
[jo]C[J: The invasion point is a bit odd. The points marked with a triangle are more natural.

Whenever you think about invading, you should also consider reducing as an alternative. For example at the points marked with a cross.

Personally I think that whites framework isn't so big and still very open. I wouldn't invade or reduce yet. The points marked with circles also look good.]
;W[dq]C[Here... i had no idea what to do next. I tried reading out the consequences of attaching at k-4, then finally gave up, settling instead for a pseudo peep... my line of reasoning is, if I can make the g-3 group live, I would be building a nice little wall opposite d-3, thus negating whatever influence it's got...

J: Pushing along the J collumn would build a "wall" but not a strong one. It wouldn't have very much effect against the white corner. Instead white builds a wall facing your weakness at P4.


White should play E3 here. It secures the corner just as much and puts a little bit more pressure on black.]
;B[ip];W[jp];B[io];W[jo];B[eo];W[np]C[I saw that coming....

J: Did you also read out the continuation you played out?];B[op]
;W[oq];B[no];W[mp];B[mo];W[lp];B[oh]C[J: So white got a lot of points but black got sente. 

The point you now played is an excellent point locally. But let's look at the gobal position.

Blacks group in the lower left is not very strong. It's not that weak either so playing elsewhere is ok. 

However white has ignored E5. Now you could first get some good sente moves against the white corner at D5 and C6. This helps your group in sente so you can then come back and play P12.]
;W[rg]C[J: White is trying to make two eyes locally but this let's black seal white in. That's never a good result. White should move out here. For instance at O14.]
;B[rh];W[qg];B[ne]C[J: Good. Seal white in.];W[cn];B[dm]C[J: If you want to defend your group then J6 is the point. Black and white are engaged in a pushing battle there. Getting ahead is very important in pushing battles. A white hane at J6 is very powerfull.]
;W[df];B[fd]C[normally I'd like E-16 better for shape, but I somehow read this out, and it seemed ok...

J: F16 leaves the corner rather open but it aims towards the center. Which is not a bad idea considering your strength on the top and right.]

(;W[ff]C[J: This move does absolutly nothing. It does not make territory, it does not attack black, it does not build a white moyo and it doesn't do a good job at reducing black's moyo either.

So let's take a look at the board position.

Right now white has a lot of solid territory in the bottom right, bottom left and top right. 

Black doesn't have much definite territory yet only the right side is really solid. But black has a lot of potential at the top and center. 

Black also has a weak group in the bottom left. That's exactly where white should play. He needs to attack black there, build up power in the center and then use that power to invades black moyo.

See the variation.];B[he]C[J: I would consider defending the lower left group here.]
;W[el]C[J: White is trying to attack blacks group in order to make territory on the left. The idea behind this is good. But the left side is really isn't very appealling for white because black can come in at B14. Instead white should start from J6 which is an important shape pont.]
;B[dk]C[this i thoroughly misread....

J: I don't understand this move. You're picking a fight where you're weak and white is strong. That's not a good idea. Over the next three moves you actually create two weak groups where you only had one.

Moving out to the center should be your first priority.
J7 looks like a good place to start running.];W[en];B[em];W[fn]
;B[dn];W[do];B[jj]SQ[dk][dm][dn][em]TR[gq][io][ip]C[I don't know if this was early, but I was reminded of a shusaku game where he plays tengen, and it's awesomeness was the fact that it checked influence, and helped stones...  here, I knew these stones were and trouble, and i was hoping that at a later time, tengen would help them...
the way i read it, I veer left, and he keeps me separated from the square stones, I vear right and eventually bump into tengen...

plus it helps every other stone I've got on the center...
this felt really awesome..

J: You have two weak groups now playing away will most likely result in one of them dying. 

However if you think you can get enough points by sacrificing them then it's fine. But it's a risky strategy.]
;W[fp]C[J: This is way to defensive. See the variation. White should start from J6. This will most likely result in either the lower group dying or it managing to move out very weak. But in that case the group on the left will die.]
;B[in]C[J: Good.];W[fm]C[I was surprised he didn't know what I was upto, and kept on eating my stones...
I decided to cut as much influence he's got into the center....... starting with k-6

J: White should really play around K6.];B[jn]C[J: Excellent move. It helps your lower left group and expands your moyo at the same time.]
;W[dl]C[another free move.. now I cut another potential area...

J: White is playing on a much to small scale.];B[lo]CR[gq][in]
[io][ip][jj][jn][mo][no][oh][op][pn][po][qh][qn][rh]C[Here I'm thinking, I'm soo far ahead.... there is no way I can lose....
the circle stones I'm aware do not have a base, but I can find them a home later on...

J: Good move again. 

The circled stones definatly have a base though. The entire right side is their "base". If white invades you should be able to kill it.]
;W[pi]C[pooishness [14k\]: sorry, completely forgot about the coffee]
;B[ph]C[oopsie [11k\]: no prob..can i have some too?];W[hg]
;B[jg];W[ok];B[qk]TR[oh][ph][pn][qh][qn][rh]C[that stone makes me very happy.  it assures me those stones are living. I think this attack is very deep and kinda silly.

J: White's invasion is way too deep.];W[jk];B[ik];W[ij];B[jl]
;W[ji];B[kk]C[this ponuki also makes me happy.
now I have a really really strong formation.];W[kj];B[jk]C[pooishness [14k\]: hehe,]
;W[kh]C[pooishness [14k\]: you won't like it.
pooishness [14k\]: it's the korean version. which means lots of sugar, and not enough coffee
oopsie [11k\]: oohh  too sweet];B[ii]C[oopsie [11k\]: any cream?
pooishness [14k\]: well, they normally come in premade packets with the cream and sugar inside.
pooishness [14k\]: kinda makes me miss good old american drip coffee]
;W[ih];B[hj]TR[ok][pi]C[I again, like this ponuki in the center.
at this point, I'm aware that I have a live wire of white stones invading ... my job at this point is to keep it away from those triangle stones.]
;W[jh];B[lj];W[mi];B[li];W[nf];B[of];W[ng];B[lh]C[I expected P 13 and read out the fact that my p14 stone is safe.  with o-13, I read out the sequence again, and thought, it should be safe..
what I didn't read, is the fact that leaving it as is means there will be a live wire of stones coming from r-15 as follows.]
;W[og];B[pf]C[J: This is a big mistake. The stone at P14 isn't important enough to save. Play O12 and cut white.]
;W[pg];B[pe];W[nh]C[here I start getting nervous, again, reading out as much variations as I can.
I'm also very aware that my P12 stones are kinda vulnerable...
but I think controlling the live wire is more important... in the process, of attacking that stone, I was hoping to build a wall...

J: White got sente and is close to connecting. This isn't good for black at all.]
;B[ni];W[oi];B[nj];W[mh]C[critical mistake here...
I was thinking O-11 is floating, and was happy to give it some life... that and by connecting it, I block the live wire away from the O8 area...

J: You need to save those four stones.];B[mj];W[ri]C[here... i know everything's lost. so I thought, leave those stones as ko threat, and just do damage control....]
;B[qj];W[qi];B[oj];W[lf]TR[jg]C[I know that stone is in trouble, but after losing a big group, 1 I didn't want to get pushed around anymore, and point wise, attacking this area seems a whole lot bigger....

J: The triangled stone isn't important. It's doing nothing so it's not worth saving it.]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[ek];W[dj];B[fl];W[cl];B[fi];W[dh];B[er];W[dr]
C[I tried reading L-14 and remember seeing a bad outcome...
you may wanna look at this and tell me which approach is best...

J: It doesn't look like you could gain anything around that area.]
;B[le];W[jf];B[lg];W[kg];B[mf];W[dc]C[ok... this I think is very lame. this should be punished.
and I am sure, there is no life here, with a 3-4 stone in place.

J: This is the disadvantage of playing F16. The corner is a lot more open then you think. 

This doesn't mean that invading is a good idea though.];B[dd]

I see a weakness at E13 and decide to set myself up for an attack on it.
if I can cut these stones, I can kinda win.

J: This is exactly why white shouldn't invade. I do think that B15 covers the weakness just enough.]

(;B[ei];W[gf];B[eg];W[ef];B[dg]

again, my aim here is to cut the circle stones....

J: A very dangerous move by white. C13 is much safer. See the variation.]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[ch];W[fg]C[I wanted D-11 badly... and was debating whether i should just go for it... however, if he takes, he has eyes, and cutting them is kinda pointless.]
;B[cg];W[fh]TR[be][ce]C[plan B was to just attack those stones.
but I'll be behind in liberties so I'm thinking, discretely add liberties to my group, then attack... so I pretended to try to connect....]

J: C2 isn't a good ko threath. D1 threathens the same. But it doesn't lose any points.

I think your biggest ko threaths start with L4.]

oopsie [11k\]: ur welcome..thiks
oopsie [11k\]: cya];B[pa];W[oa]C[J: My overall advice would be to learn which stones are important and which stones are not.

Over the course of the game you had a weak group in the lower left but neglected to defend it several times in order to take big points. A defensive move at the right time can be a lot bigger then you think because it prevents an attack.

On the other hand you worried about unimportant stones quite a bit. P14 and K13 for instance aswell as D7 in the fight in the lower left.

I would also recommend to study a lot of tsumego. In particular tesuji problems. The book Tesuji by James Davies is excellent for someone of your skill.


You asked what exactly your strength is. I can't possibly give you an exact answer based on just one game. You played a pretty close even game against an 11k so if his rating is any good I would put you at about 12-13 kyu. Just let the rating system figure it out in due time.

I hope this review was helpfull.])
