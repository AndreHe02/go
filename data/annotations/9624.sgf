C[Hello. My name is Tim. I'm about 2k, and I was asked to review this game for white. I'll do my best. The player was most interested in having me look at the attempt to kill black's R9 group and the failed plan to connect groups on the bottom.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[cp]C[This move is less common than D3. It is facing white's stone and so white could approach it for a big move later.]
;W[pd];B[nc];W[qf];B[kc];W[eq]C[This is why C4 is inferior to D3. White can make this approach. It works well with the Q4 stone.]
;B[cm];W[cf]LB[iq:B][jq:A]C[This tenuki is fine, but a move on the bottom is also a good idea. A and B are both possible. I would play A. Nevertheless, this tenuki is a good move. Black's C7 is a bit passive; so it's ok to play elsewhere.]
;B[gd]C[This move is also a bit strange. F16 is better.]
(;W[ef]C[I don't like this move for white. It would be better to jump into the corner and make a base. See the variation.]
;B[hf]C[This is also a strange move. I think black should pincer with something like C10 or block the corner with B16. Also, approaching the bottom right stone is much bigger than a move like this.]

(;W[hq]C[This is in an important area, but it is a overconcentrated. White can extend further.]
;B[di]C[This move is painful. It shows why E14 was a bad move. White has no base and will have trouble running around.]

(;W[fh]C[There is a proverb about not running with a knight's move. This is better for attacking. When you are running you should avoid this move because it can be cut. Diving  into the corner would be better. See the variation.]
;B[nq]C[Approaching this corner is big, but I think this is the wrong side. R6 is better because there is more room over there. R14 is farther away than H3; so black has less room here. White can attack this move and make some nice profit.]
;W[pr]LB[qm:E][pn:B][qn:A][kq:D][lq:C]C[This move is much too passive. It is not a move I see very much if at all. A through E are better in my opinion. They are, at any rate, much more common.]
;B[kq]
(;W[io]LB[qm:A]C[I don't like this move either. After black made a base with L3, the best thing to do is make a big extension on the right side. See the variation.]

(;B[qk]C[This move is in the right general area, but this is too easy on white. R6 is better. This move fails to punish Q2. See the variation]
;W[qm]C[This is a very nice move. White makes a huge corner and a great attack on R9]
;B[qh]C[This move is pretty much mandatory. White should protect the corner up top now.]
;W[dk]C[This is an interesting idea. I like the way white has turned the attack around over here, but I think the corner is bigger.]

(;B[ck]
(;W[ej]C[This move gives up the attack.];B[kn]C[This is one space too far. It should be at L5.]

(;W[il];B[kl];W[jj]LB[pb:C][cc:B][qc:D][bd:A][ko:F][cq:E]C[It's not totally clear to me what white is after here. If you are attacking black, then cutting around L5 is better. If this move is aiming to build territory in the center, then I think it has the wrong idea. There are still open corners. A through F are all bigger moves.]
;B[nk];W[mh]C[Once again, I'm not entirely sure what white wants here. This move is out in the middle of nowhere. It's not making territory, and it's not attacking any groups.]
;B[em]C[Black is right to tenuki, but this is the wrong area. The corners are much bigger. Remember the proverb: Corners first, then sides, then center. Both players are going after the center before settling the corners.]
;W[fl]C[Same problem.];B[cr]C[There it is.  Black seals the corner. This move is worth a lot of points.]
;W[dr]C[Too late for this. And I think it's gote.]
(;B[cq]
(;W[eo]C[This move doesnt secure too many points. The top corners are huge right now. See the variations.]
;B[do];W[fm];B[mf];W[og];B[kg];W[pb]C[Huge! Better late than never. Nice move.]
;B[nb]C[This is very passive. Black is blocking the monkey jump (I suppose) but this is a slow move.]
;W[bd]C[Excellent! White got both of the big corner moves. Well done.]
;B[cc];W[nr]C[I like the idea of picking on this group, but this might not be the best move for the job. I still like the idea of cutting at L5.  White could also consider cutting around Q10. It's the same idea. Both L6 and O9 are one space too far. They should be at L5 and P9. Black is stretching too far.]
;B[mr];W[oq];B[np]C[Now black is more solid here. White helped black with these moves.]
;W[op]C[Bad shape.];B[on]C[Ouch. Black is sealing in way too much here.]
;W[pn];B[oo]
(;W[po]C[This move is gote and it's not necessary to play here. White should play more actively. See variations.]
;B[cg]
(;W[df];B[bf]C[This hane is possible now because white played D14 instead of D13.]
;W[be];B[af];W[ae];B[bg];W[cd];B[ed]C[Black D17 is better than this move.]
;W[bc]C[Because of this. Nice move!];B[cb];W[bb];B[ih]
(;W[nd];B[md];W[ne];B[me];W[ng];B[lg];W[li];B[oh];W[om]C[This move is good.]
;B[nm]C[White has some interesting options here. Playing atari at O6 is a nice idea.]

(;W[ol];B[nl]
(;W[no]C[This is an ambitious attack, but I think that pushing at O9 and cutting would be better.]
;B[nn];W[mo];B[mq];W[ko];B[lo];W[ln];B[lp];W[km];B[mn];W[jn]
;B[lm];W[ok];B[oj];W[nj]C[Excellent! Black is in big trouble now. This was one of the main areas of concern. If white wins the fight here by killing black then the game is pretty much over.]
;B[pk];W[oi];B[pj]
(;W[nh];B[ph];W[rl]C[Things are looking good so far.];B[pi]
C[I think white has to ignore this in order to go for the kill.]

(;W[ni];B[rk];W[rg];B[ql]C[This is a nice tesuji for black. Black is alive now. The best way to avoid this would have been ignoring Q11. O11 was the fatal mistake for white.]

;W[hi];B[dj];W[ei];B[dh];W[dl];B[dn]C[Whoah. Black simply cannot leave C8 open like this.]

(;W[en];B[dm]C[One more chance to play C8 and destroy black.]

(;W[el];B[cl]C[Now the opportunity is gone.];W[ca];B[da]C[Aha! Black made this mistake. This is worth learning. I think that players around this level (17k or so) might not know this tesuji. White should play D18. I'll show it again.]

;W[jl];B[ll];W[kn]C[The game is close. It depends on endgame now. C1 is enormous. It is sente for white.]

I think there were a few missed opporunities, but there was a solid sense of strategy throughout the game. I think the biggest things to improve on are in the opening. Make sure to take care of the big corner moves before going for the center. And the tesuji at D18 is worth knowing. Great job! Keep up the good work.]
