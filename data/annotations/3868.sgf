C[[Way*\] Hi, I'm WayFarer and I played Black for this game.  This is the first game I've submitted to GTL.

[Way*\] The only general comment I have about my gameplay is that do not know any joseki aside from the 3-3 invasions (and even then, I don't really know any of the correct responses to deviations).

[Way*\] Thanx in advance for the review!!



[[ Hi, I'm enfo, I'm a KGS 9k. My comments this game will be in double brackets. I hope my review will be helpful to you \]\]]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[qj]TR[pc]LB[qn:A][pn:B][qm:C]C[[[ I'm not 100% sure, but from my point of view, this move looks questionable. Here's two reasons why:

1) It doesn't have a threatening follow up. (which is why the move marked A or B might be better.

2) It gives white a very nice move at C, which produces a shimari (corner enclosure) while threatening the stone you just played.

Again I'm not completely positive on this one. Generally when I make comments I will be pretty sure that it is a general principle unless I say I'm not sure =)  This way you know what is from perspective, and what is from a general perspective \]\]]
;W[ed];B[df];W[cc];B[dd]LB[dc:A]C[[Way*\] My impression is that this is not a good response, as it leaves me heavy.

[[Heaviness isn't what makes this move questionable. What makes it questionable is it forces white to play at A. Playing at A will create the formation that I will mark on the next move. But there are some joseki that create this shape (in example the nadare or avalanche joseki, but they are usually really complicated and settle the board pretty fast\]\]]
;W[dc]TR[cc][ed]C[[[This shape is a "hane at the head of two stones". Which according to go proverbs is really good for white, and pretty bad for you\]\]]
;B[ci]C[[Way*\] I also saw E15 as a possible move.  I didn't take it b/c I'm horribly territory oriented.  That move was on my mind for the next few moves, and then I eventually forgot about it.

[[This move isn't terrible, but again, it doesn't threaten to do anything evil to white, which is what moves should do. In theory, the only moves that don't threaten anything to the opposing player are moves that are urgent or critical. This move is neither. It does however solidfy your group so you don't have to worry about white pincering it in.\]\]]
;W[fc];B[jc];W[pe];B[nd];W[qc]TR[qb]
(;B[od]C[[Way*\] This feels better than Q16.

[[ Actually this one is too heavy and it doesn't threaten anything. Heavy doesn't mean it's a clump of solid stones, it also means that the clump of stones isn't doing anything immediate or direct to adjacent white stones. In this case, this would be considered an example of korigatchi or overconcentration.

What's a good alternative? See the following variation for something I would do. I think it is joseki too \]\]]
;W[pd]C[[[ See, here white forces you to reinforce q17 while claiming a point of territory and solidfying his attacking group. \]\]]
;B[pb];W[qb];B[qg]C[[[ Good. This makes white cramped while reinforcing you lonely R10 \]\]]
;W[qf];B[pg]TR[qg][qj]LB[qk:A]C[[[ This shape is little overconcentrated. Normally from a wall of two stones on the third or fourth line you want three spaces. This move would be perfect if the R10 stone was played at A, at R9. \]\]]
;W[ql];B[pl];W[qm];B[qk];W[pm];B[jp];W[lp];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr]
;W[cq];B[jq]MA[nq]C[[Way*\] I wanted to get the equivalent of "If 2, jump 3".  I thought I was still stretched thin, though.

[[ I like this move. You're right, it works well with f3, solidifies k4, and threatens to pop in at o3. If white decides to block you should 3-3 invade right away, it would be perfect\]\]]
;W[lr];B[pq]TR[pm][qm][ql][lp][lr]C[[Way*\] My plan here wasn't to live in the corner, but to reduce as much territory as possible.  I had hoped this stone would give me aji.

[[ This would be an awesome, dan-level move if the m2 stone wasn't there. Unfortunately, a simple 3-3 invasion here would be more safe because you are walled in by the marked stones. Making territory along the left or right sides would be considered miai (alternatives) \]\]]
;W[oq]C[[Way*\] And then I decided...];B[qq]C[[Way*\] ... what the heck, why not try living in here? =)]
;W[qp];B[or];W[nq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq]C[[Way*\] I think this was the wrong move, but I decided to risk it and bet on my opponent going at R5 or R6.]
;W[qo];B[nr];W[mr]C[[Way*\] Lucky me.  And I got sente.];B[ol]
C[[Way*\] I didn't know where else to go.  F5 looked good to me, but I hoped that this move would force my opponent to defend at P7.

[[ This is a good move, builds your territory and threatens to reduce theirs \]\]]
;W[om];B[rf]C[[Way*\] At the time, this seemed large enough to me to give up sente for.  Not sure now.]
;W[re];B[rg];W[pf]C[[[ This is a really bad move on white's part. It is tiny, heavy, not urgent, and basically useless.\]\]]
;B[nl];W[nm];B[ng]C[[Way*\] Small and single-minded.  I shouldn't have done this, in retrospect.  At this point during the game, I had noticed C8 as a possible extension for me.  I wasn't too sure if that was good or not, though.  I had already forgotten about E15, and I was considering B17.

[[ No this move is awesome. It locks white's group into the top right, and creates more cash for you in your middle side group. If white went p13 you would have had big problems. your C8 C9 extension isn't needed because c11 is sufficient. However you are right c8 would be a bit move, but to me, o13 looks bigger. \]\]]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[ll];B[nj]C[[Way*\] Too defensive?  I was worried about cutitng points.

[[ yup too defensive, simply block him at m9 \]\]];W[ck];B[dk]
;W[dl];B[dj];W[gq];B[gp];W[fp];B[fr];W[hp]
(;B[hq]C[[Way*\] I misplayed during the game.  I had intended to go to G2, and go for territory instead of influence.  I figured that the iron pillar at K4 would allow me to reduce the white moyo gained by this reduction.  But, I made a mistake and went H3 instead.

[Way*\] However, during my self-review, I noticed the the sequence black G2, white H3, black H2, white J2, and then the iron pillar gets cut off.]
;W[go];B[gr];W[iq];B[hr]
(;W[ip]C[[Way*\] Mistake for white, right?  He should've went J2

[[ Yeah, would have been big trouble \]\]];B[ir];W[kr];B[jr]
;W[jo]C[[[ I'm sure you can tell that this is a horrible result for you. You got locked in on the first line, and white got awesome influence towards center. See my variation for a different outcome \]\]]
;B[cr];W[br];B[dq];W[bp];B[eq]CR[is][ds]TR[cs][js]LB[es:1][fs:2]
[gs:3][hs:4]C[[Way*\] Not sure if this was sente, but it seemed urgent.

[[ This is not sente and not urgent. Even if white peeps in at k1 and c1, you have more than 3 stones width to make 2 eyes.\]\]]
;W[ep];B[el];W[dm];B[lk]CR[kl][jl][jm][hl][il][im][in][hn][hm]
[ho]TR[lj][kk][kj][ki][jk][jj][ji][jh]C[[Way*\] Again, small.  I was hoping my oponent would respond at L9 or something.

[[ this is big. The more potential territory you have behind the stone.. the bigger the move is. The top of the board in the middle is almost all yours so this is huge. To see how huge this move, the triangle marked area represents what you gained in moyo. The circled area represents what this move threatens if your opponent didn't respond. \]\]]
;W[le]MA[je];B[lc]MA[je][nf]C[[[ Too passive. Lock him in at k15. Or sever his connection at o14. You have great thickness in this area..good to use it. \]\]]
;W[nf];B[og]TR[mg]C[[[ Too heavy, n13 better \]\]];W[ne];B[ko]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[jm];B[kp];W[hc];B[se]C[[Way*\] Is this the appropriate time for such a move?  It seemed like sente, but I'm not sure if moves like these should be played now or closer to the end.

[[it's not bad, most groups are pretty much solid and stable so the game could probably be considered in yose (endgame), and yes this is sente. \]\]]
;W[sd];B[sf];W[rd];B[fk];W[ff];B[ee];W[fe];B[mo];W[mp];B[mn]
;W[mm]C[[Way*\] Mistake for white, right?.  Gave me sente.]
;B[oo];W[op];B[on]C[[Way*\] Small.  I should've been satsified with my invasion so far and played B17, which seems urgent.  Or E12 to expand the moyo a little bit.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[ef];B[de];W[eh];B[dh];W[eg];B[lg]C[[Way*\] Small.  B17?  B10?

[[ Big. B17 and b10 are big too. \]\]];W[kb];B[lb];W[kc];B[kd]
;W[jb];B[jd];W[ib];B[ld]C[[Way*\] I knew, after I played this move, that White could go at O19 and reduce me to a bloody mess.  I was hoping he would not see it.]
;W[nb]C[[Way*\] I did not expect this.];B[qa];W[rb];B[la]C[[Way*\] I misread the cut at P17.  I thought I was fine, but realized I wasn't after he made the cut.]
;W[oc];B[nc];W[ob];B[jf]C[[[ Painful. Good thing you were able to ruin his territory on the bottom earlier \]\]]
;W[lf];B[kg];W[kf];B[je]MA[hf][if]C[Marked areas might have been better than simply connecting.]

;W[ie];B[hd];W[hg];B[he];W[gg];B[hh];W[lh];B[mh];W[kh]C[[Way*\] I was debating between saving those 2 stones and B17.

[[ b17 and b10 are bigger at this point \]\]];B[mg];W[kk];B[bc]
C[[Way*\] I felt this was more urgent than reducing the moyo in the lower left quadrant.  I really wanted to play near F6.]
;W[bb];B[bd];W[bj];B[bi];W[fm];B[em];W[en];B[aj];W[bk];B[ak]
;W[al];B[ai];W[fl]LB[bl:A]C[[Way*\] I had debated letting him capture this and going at B8.  I decided against it b/c I didn't want the M19 stones cut off.

[[ You should have let him take it you connect by playing e10. Instead you should have played at A and punish him \]\]]
;B[ek];W[bl];B[gd];W[fd];B[gc];W[gb];B[ei]C[[Way*\] I sort of felt nervous that the M19 stones would be cut off if White went here.  In other words, I panicked =)]

[Way*\] Thanx for the review!!

[[ You played well. You never did anything horribly wrong (except for top right blunder). Some of the moves you said were small were actually quite big. I would say you play a little too defensively and should be a bit more aggressive. Take more risks, even if you lose, you'll learn alot from it. \]\]]
