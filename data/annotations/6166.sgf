AB[dp][pd]C[dmg: My name is Damien and I'll be reviewing your game. All my comments will be with "dmg:" at the beginning. I hope this review will help you.

To reviewer:
To sum up (from my perspective): My openings are horrible, I did really well in the midgame, my endgame is bad. :)

@ the end of the game, I have no corners, but I did well in taking a lot of territory and making her work for hers in the process (with the exception of the corners).

Thanks in advance!];W[dd];B[pp];W[qn];B[nq];W[rp];B[qq];W[qk]
;B[fc];W[id];B[cc];W[dc]C[dmg: Until here everything is ok.]

(;B[db]C[dmg: You should go for C16 first. Look at the variation. However D18 is correct too]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]
(;B[ce]C[dmg: This is a small mistake that leads to another mistake that leads to the result you know :). C16 would have been good. (B15 is also possible but too submissive)]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[de];B[cf];W[df];B[dg]C[dmg: Hane looks dangerous, what would you have done if white C13 right now?]

(;W[eg];B[dh]C[This should've been a connection @ C13, I suppose.

dmg: see my previous and future comments. White E13 was just helping you.]
;W[cg]
(;B[bg]C[dmg: Wrong, answer around B15];W[be];B[bc];W[bf];B[ch]
C[dmg: Giving live to your corner group by playing A18 or B19 is bigger.]
;W[cf]C[dmg: White is kind enough to save a 1 pt stone and let you play B19 or A18]
;B[dl];W[ab]C[dmg: Too late.];B[ba];W[da];B[nc]TR[jp][qh]C[dmg: I find this move slow (just a personnal feeling though). R12 Quicker? R12 also pressure the three white stones on the right. K4 is also bigger I think.]
;W[lc];B[ld]TR[nc][pd]MA[dq][jp][qf][qh][rd]C[dmg: This is the first move in a serie of bad shapes.
The three triangle stones are not working well together (M16 is not doing anything).
Plus M16 is contact play. Contact play is a defensive play, it results in reinforcement of the opponent. So you generally want to play those move only when needed for defense.
Crosses are way bigger.];W[kc]C[dmg: Whit e is kind enough not to hane. (White should have played L16 here)]
;B[md]C[dmg: There you're defending this lonely unconsistant stone.]
;W[qf]C[dmg: And white take the big point.];B[qe]LB[dq:B][jp:C]
[qd:D][qh:E][rd:A]C[dmg: Contact play again. It's presssing against a strong stone. For protecting the corner prefer A or D (D stronger and probably the best here. Else invade at E or make a framework on the bottom with B or C]
;W[pf];B[nf]C[dmg: Here all the main reasons of making a move:
  - Escaping a weak group.
  - Pressuring a weak group.
  - Constructing a framework.
  - Making two eyes for a weak group.
  - Killing a weak group
  - Creating a weak group
  - Removing points from the opponent frameworks.

This move is doing none of those. It only prepares for a future invasion around R12.
In fact this move is helping white constructing on the 5th line.]
;W[qc]C[dmg: I don't think this is working...];B[pc];W[re]
(;B[rd]C[dmg: Nop... See variation.];W[qd];B[pe];W[rc];B[qb]
;W[rb];B[pb]C[dmg: This is 5 points gote for white to take this stones. You can live that as it stands.]
;W[iq]C[And white is taking the last big point.];B[fq];W[lq]
;B[mo]TR[gp][hm][ho]MA[di][dj][dk][dm][dn][do][dq][eq][fr][fs]
LB[gn:B][hn:A]C[dmg: This shape looks weird. Also this is pressuring M4 but for nothing. I would have pressured from the other side (somewhere around B or A) to increase your moyo]
;W[io];B[qo]TR[pp][qq]LB[rp:1]C[dmg: Too much precipitation here. Wait until you're sure you'll gain more that what you're going to lose. This is keeping aji. Furthermore this is bad shape because of 1.]
;W[ro];B[qm]MA[qo]C[dmg: Yet another bad shape.  This is like a cutted tobi.]
;W[rm]C[dmg: White way to submissive here, He should have gone at Q6.]
;B[pn];W[rn];B[pm];W[ql];B[qi]C[I knew this stone would be captured. I'm trying to get an idea of this 'aji' concept.

dmg: This stone getting captured? I'd like to see that. This is a perfect invasion. Good timing, hard to capture (you have black support from all side of the goban). This was probably the biggest move on the board.]
;W[pi]C[dmg: This is a killing move from white but he doesn't have the means to do it.]

(;B[pj]C[dmg: I would have gone at Q12. Look at the variation.]
;W[qj]
(;B[oi]C[dmg: ...that's happen. The atari should have been at Q12. See var.]
;W[ph];B[oj];W[qp];B[po];W[rq];B[qr];W[jf];B[gh]C[dmg: Nice playing on the frontier of two moyo.]
;W[ik];B[im];W[ii];B[hj];W[ij];B[gj]C[dmg: What is that?];W[lg]

(;B[dn]MA[ds]C[dmg: D1 kills here. L+1 Group. http://senseis.xmp.net/?L1Group
If you kill, you don't have to care about the cut at D5 (which is not really working)]

;B[il];W[gr];B[ir];W[is];B[og]C[Playing this instead of covering @ B12 is one of several moves that ended up costing me this game.

dmg: I don't think so B12 is only 5 point gote.];W[oh];B[nh]
;W[of];B[oe]C[dmg: this is only 2point gote...];W[rr]C[This is big.]
;B[rs];W[mb]C[dmg: And this, white is taking all the big points in sente. However here, tenuki is just 2point, So tenuki (B12 is beginning to get enormous).]

[sj][sk][sl][sm][sn][so][sp]C[dmg: Well this game was pretty complex. You had many opportunities you did not exploit to play slow moves. You should try to think about what is your aim and what's the best way to exploit it.
If you're playing a move it should do something. Taking points, removing points, chasing or saving. Also your endgame is way too submissive. You should rework the notion of sente in the endgame.
A sente move can be left unanswered if you're losing only 2points and you have a sente move where your opponent is losing 5 or 10 points by non-answering.
As I've pointed during my comment, try to work the efficiency of your shapes (this come from playing essentially and testing out shapes). Finally DO A LOT OF TSUMEGO :)
I hope this review will help you.

I know that A18 isn't dead, but I couldn't get my opponent to unmark it. :( Oh well, I lost with or without it, but the game was a lot of fun!

Thanks again! (In advance)])
