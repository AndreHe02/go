;B[qi];W[op];B[oq]LB[oo:A]C[ug: Black could consider the outside attachment at A instead; that might
work well with the black stone at R11.];W[nq];B[pq];W[np]
(;B[jp]LB[pn:A][ip:B]C[was it correct ?
I didn't want white to play B if I played A

ug: I think I just would have played at Q5 instead, to finish the joseki. The problem with
A (Q6) is that it leaves a defect at R5, which makes it easy for white to invade at R8
later; of course you might play there anyway, but it's
unusual. (R6 instead of Q5 is too low, anyway.)

In my opinion K4 is not so good, since now white can destroy the potential that
black had on the right side. White should develop outside influence which could
make it difficult for black to build a moyo on the left.];W[qo]
;B[ro]
(;W[po]C[ug: White might also play Q4 instead (see variation)]
;B[rn];W[ol]C[I think it was to high for white, wasn't it ?

ug: I think that's ok for white.];B[dj];W[fq]C[ug: White could consider G4 instead, to attack the black K4 stone more directly.]

(;B[hq]C[ug: This looks a bit strange. Since the white F3 stone is already pincered
by K4, it is a bit inefficient to play a "second pincer" at H3. If white now simply
invades the corner at C3, the K4 stone will look a bit silly, no matter in which direction
black blocks.

That leaves the question what black might do instead of H3.
With K4 in place, E3 is one standard move, but that is maybe be too risky
here, because the K4 stone might get under attack. I think I would try
black E2 here.]
(;W[cn]C[ug: White C3 seems better (see variation).];B[fp];W[cq]
;B[eq];W[cp];B[do];W[co]C[ug: White C7 seems more efficient.]
;B[em]C[I was happy to see white on the 3rd line and get a moyo toward the center, even if it was a bit overconcentrated.   ug: The question is how much black can get from his moyo, since white
should use his strong O4 group to reduce it. But still, black can probably be satisfied  with this result.]
;W[ed];B[nf]C[ug: This is the wrong direction, since black cannot expect any significant territory
on the right. It might be better to invade the top, although it is difficult to say
where would be the best point. J17 or G17 can be considered.]
;W[jc];B[je];W[jn]C[ug: Probably white should answer K15, for example with H16 or K16.]
;B[ic];W[dh]C[ug: Might be better at C12 (and, again, answering at the top might be even more important).]
;B[id];W[kq]C[ug: This is very bad. First of all, I think white does not need to be worried about his group,
and second, with this move he is going to strengthen black enormously. If white wants
to play here, M5 is certainly a better place; P11 might also be good.]
;B[kp];W[lp];B[lo];W[mo];B[kn];W[ln];B[ko];W[km];B[lm];W[mn]
;B[kl];W[jq];B[ip]C[ug: Ths seems to be a big success for black. He gained great strength in the center.]
;W[gc];B[kc]C[ug: Might be a bit slow. This is the fourth stone that black invests in order to capture a
single white stone. You could try to strengthen your moyo in the center
instead, for example by O10 or G11.];W[rb];B[jm];W[fi];B[eh]

(;W[di]C[ug: E11 instead looks much better];B[ei];W[ej];B[dk]
;W[eg];B[fh];W[hi]C[It is hard to say anything definitive about the fight that follows now, so I simply
give some alternative moves at certain places.

Of course, it is a very hard fight for white, and black should certainly gain something
from it, somewhere.]

;B[dg]C[was it correct ? maybe white could answer better than he did ...

ug: Certainly there is a better answer for white than that in the game, (I think
white should sacrifice his two stones D11, D12), but black can make some profit
here.]
(;W[cg];B[df];W[ee];B[cf]C[ug: I don't see a way how white could save his stones now. So he should take
sente elsewhere (or play at B8 right away).];W[ch];B[bf];W[cj]

;B[bi];W[ci];B[bg];W[cm];B[aj]C[white didn't resign but did poorly at the end

ug: Well, there should be no way how black could lose this game.

Because black didn't make many mistakes in this game (white made a lot
more, anyway), I find it hard to give a general comment on how you should try
to improve your game. One thing is that you should try to make your stones
work together efficiently. For example, I think you should have tried to
make the stones in the lower right work together with R11 (by playing at P5
instead of P3, say).])
(;W[df]C[ug: This way white can keep sente, and since he can reduce any territory that black might
get on the left by playing at B8, it is not a big problem to give up two stones.]

(;B[er]C[ug: Of course there are many possibilities now, but I think black should manage
to get some kind of attack going, and black's stone on K4 won't be in great danger.]

(;B[rq];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm]C[ug: I think this is one common variation if black omits a play at Q5 or R6.
I think this would be a good result.])
(;B[qn]C[Since the usual answer at S3 doesn't give black a satisfying result, he might try this ...]
;W[qq];B[po];W[rq]C[ug: The ponnuki works well with the R11 stone,  but white gets a fairly big corner, so I think this is ok for white too.
If black wanted to go for influence on the right instead of for the corner,
he should have played at P5 instead of P3 to begin with, I think.]
)))
(;B[po];W[ip]C[ug: There is no need to fear this play by white. Black could approach the C16 stone now,
or he could play at G3. Since the white extension is one space wider that is "should be",
black could, at some time, stir up some trouble if white doesn't defend.]
