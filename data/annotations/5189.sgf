C[First of all thanks a lot for review this game, I'll try to learn from your advice ;)

I played this game as black and I felt quite frequently bad timing in my moves, allowing white to take good points. Sometimes I played attacking moves before territory-oriented moves, probably it's wrong way...

I added few comments, usually about local groups, where I think I could do better, please let me know if my guesses are good or bad.

All of my comments will begin with RR:

Any questions, please let me know.


Final analyais:
After reviewing the game, I have some comments for black.
1.  White made some dumb moves that a person would not do.  Keep this in mind.

2.  Several times, black followed white's moves.  Especially against a computer, it is good to look for the right spot to play, and not follow your opponent.

3.  When looking for a spot to play, I always ask myself these three questions: 
     1)  Where am I weak?
     2)  Where is my opponent weak?
     3)  Where is the big point?

If I answer "nowhere" to the first question, I move on to the next question.

4)  There were several black groups that were left with big weaknesses, which white didn't take advantage of.  Black should slow down a little bit and make sure groups are safe.]

(;B[pd];W[dc];B[cp]C[RR:  Attacking move.  Because black plays opposite corners, this will be a fighting game.]
;W[qq];B[ce];W[dh];B[ee];W[fd];B[cg]TR[eg]C[I don't like this move, now I prefer c17.
It's urgent or maybe I can play e3 and try to pincer d6 after I get some thickness on my top left group?

RR:  First of all, I don't think you can pincer the stone until the two black stones get a little stronger.

RR:  If you can't extend on the side, it is always a good move to go towards the center. (E13)  

RR:  But in this situation, I think the C13 played move is a good one.  Black is somewhat strong here, but a bit overconcentrated.]
;W[eq];B[ep]C[RR:  This is a good attack on the white stone on the left side.

RR:  White is not as good, because of the stone on the bottom right is on the 3,3 point, which doesn't extend to the left side very well.]
;W[fp]
(;B[dq]LB[eo:1][cq:3][dq:2]C[d3 it's small but I don't know how to play the corner.

RR:  You were right with the marked B spot.  See the marked 1,2,3 for the sequence here.  The goal is to create a strong corner facing the left side, and the while will have a strong position facing the bottom.]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]LB[lc:B][qf:A]C[RR:  I agree with the move for white.  There is alot of room on the right side to grab.   The white stone on the 3,3 point on the bottom right is in a bad position to grab any territory on the right side (will only grab territory on the bottom right corner).  Fighting at the marked B spot will make it hard for black to get any territory on the right side.]
;W[jd];B[pp];W[qp]
(;B[pq]LB[po:B][pq:A]C[RR:  Yes, extend to B.];W[po];B[oo];W[pn]
;B[on]C[RR:  White is doing well here.  Creeping along the 4th line getting a nice territory, where black is getting a wall, but that wall is facing white stones.]
;W[qo];B[np];W[fq];B[eo]TR[jq]C[RR:  The big point is somewhere along the bottom, see the marked point.  This extends from blacks wall, and will make white over-concentrated.]
;W[gn];B[dj]TR[jq]C[better to extend around j4, maybe?

RR:  Yeah.  K3 is a vital point.  But then again, so is your played stone at D10.  D10 gives black some more options, so I think   I think that black played the right move here.]
;W[ch];B[fh]C[It seems better to me c17 since it seems difficult to black to connect their left groups?

RR:  Yes.  Like I mentioned earlier, if you don't have a good base, make sure to go to the middle.]
;W[ei];B[eh];W[dg];B[di];W[fj];B[cc];W[cb];B[dd];W[ec];B[bh]
TR[df][bj]C[maybe better to protect my left side?
I see two options, which is better?:
  1. extend my left group at d8
  2. block at c11

RR:  C11 is almost certainly a bad move, at it makes an empty triangle for black.  To block, I would play a move like B10, which does the same thing.

RR:  To save the corner group, I would play at the D14 spot.  This gives you one eye.

RR:  Which one is better?  Probably saving the top group.  That would be alot of stones to have die.]
;W[bg];B[ci];W[dl]LB[cf:1]C[RR:  I'm not 100% sure, but it looks like white can get life on the side with the move at "1".  There may be a way for black to make a false eye, but it looks difficult.  (side note, it has been a long time since I've played out a real game, and my reading is a little rusty.)]
;B[fl]TR[ek]C[RR:  When making a diagonal move like this, I don't like to be cut off.  A white move at the makred spot would be bad for black.  Instead of where black did play, I would play the marked spot instead.]
;W[gk];B[ek];W[hl];B[ho];W[jl];B[lc];W[pb];B[le]TR[qc]C[RR:  Best to keep the corner on the 3,3 point.]
;W[ne];B[mf];W[rc];B[pm]TR[qi]C[RR:  Best to extend from the top black group, so it doesn't loose its eyes.]
;W[hq]TR[ko]C[RR:  White can make a better attack than this.  See the marked spot L5]
;B[go];W[qh];B[pg];W[nf];B[ng];W[hd]TR[mg]C[RR:  This white attack could be better too.  Best to cut black stones here at N13.]
;B[fn]TR[fo]C[RR:  White can cut black's stones with this move.  Black should stay connected with the F5 move instead of F6.]
;W[qm];B[ql];W[rm];B[ol]C[RR:  White was too conservative here.  Black got a agood result here.]
;W[qj]TR[mg][hh][pk][nm][fo][ko]C[Here I start to see something that looks like a big central moyo for black with a white group that seems not killable. What It's better?

  1. try to make black stronger making wall on top, left and bottom
  2. simply try to reduce space of h8 group


RR:  Moyo is a tricky thing.  It usually isn't as big as it looks.  I see several spots where white can make some forcing moves, and cut into black's "big moyo".   There is still a big space on the bottom that black can take.  Also, black needs to firm up the weak group on the top right.]
