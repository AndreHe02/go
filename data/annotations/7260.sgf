RE[W+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[This is a REALLY short game that I feel I lost because I made some Critical reading errors in it.  I was really impatient this game sand didn't take my time.  I included some variations I that I think could have prevented me from losing so early at all.  Feel free to correct any of them if they are wrong or if I missed a move.  Even though the game record says I won, I won becuae I didn't know how to use this client and couldn't find the resign button.  When I asked my opponent where it was, he suddenly resigned and I don't know why.

>>>>>>

I have nothing to say except that W looks like a very strong player that could exploit your mistakes very well.]

This move aims to build influence in the bottom.
Your response may not be the best, but it is simple. I like it.]

It looks bad only because white got strong on the other side.]

This move is more or less a pass.];W[oo]C[Ouch! That hurt.]
;B[op];W[no];B[np];W[nn];B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[lm];B[kl]C[Another bad move.  I played this out of anger for some reason. I usually don't play like this.
