AB[pd][dp][pp]PL[W];W[ce];B[cc]C[Maybe a matter of taste, but this move gives a lot of thickness to White. Since White is the stronger player and wants to fight, I think this is not good for Black.]

(;B[fd]LB[fb:A]C[Joseki is A, see Var.];W[ee];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb]
;W[hc];B[dj]LB[nc:C][cm:A][cn:B]C[Question: Is D10 a good move or Black should play at O17?
Answer: Black C would surely be answerd with White B, so playing on the left side is hot. but I would prefer holding back at A instead of D10. "Stay away from thickness", the proverb tells us. D10 maybe get seperated and can't develop toward White's thickness.]
;W[bc]LB[db:B][be:A]C[I think this is aji-keshi. Maybe White will later prefer to play at A in relation to the left side, which would also threaten the peep at B.]
;B[hb]C["Don't push the opponent" is another Go-wisdom. White gains by this exchange.]
;W[ic];B[bb];W[db];B[eb];W[bd];B[cb];W[qf];B[pf]LB[nc:A]C[This strenghtens both sides. White gains a stable group and Black influence to the left, which is unfortunatly useless in view of Whites thickness at the top left. I would prefer A.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[nc]LB[pe:C][qh:B][pi:D][qj:A]C[The joseki wants White to defend at A or B (the latter prepares for the cut at C). Black now can either attack at D (Var 1 )or play to get sente, since White must comeback to the right side (Var 2).]

(;B[qg]LB[pe:A]C[I knew this is wrong move, which I regreted.
Question: Should I play P17?
Answer: This cut works if the liberty at A is filled, what makes a cut there not possible at the moment. Black should have played at P17.]
;W[qh];B[rg];W[rh];B[re];W[rf];B[pe];W[sg]C[This is a desaster for Black, The so called tortoise-shape is said to be twice as strong as a ponnuki.]
;B[me]LB[ob:A][kc:B]C[Too slow. Securing a basewith A while taking territory and aiming at the invasion at B would have been better.]
;W[ld]LB[ob:A][kc:B]C[This exchange favours White but still Black A makes B a threat.]
;B[md]C[Striking at the "belly" of a knights-move is vonsidered as bad style.  Here it only strengthens White, since Black cannot cut at M17. Moreover p18 has lost his value, Black has gained nothing and White a lot.]
;W[mc];B[le];W[kd]LB[ob:A][pb:C][jf:E][lh:B][nh:D]C[Question: What is the correct move in this situation for black?
Answer: In this position with a weak black group between two strong white groups first priority is to seek safetey, either by making or base (preferable) (A) or moving into the centre (B). When moving make sure to move as fast as possible by maintaing the connection to the main body of the group. So C, D and E are also possible.]
;B[jf]TR[fd][dj]C[This move is good. It maintains connection to the main body while also communicating with the marked stones.]

(;W[ke]LB[kf:A]C[This time White strikes at the belly of the knights move. Usually one wants to cut by jumping through the knight at A, but as the variation shows, this does not work.]

(;B[mg]LB[kf:A]C[Answering at A is mandatory. See Var];W[kf]
;B[qn]C[Good move. This is where White want to play too.];W[fq]
LB[cn:A]TR[dj]C[I would like to see White approaching at A, making the marked stone a target. Together with L15 he might be able to engineer a double attack against A and the group above.]

(;B[eq]LB[dn:D][ip:B][jp:A][hq:C]C[This move is clearly bad. It works only with a stone in the vincinty of A to force White into a narrow position. Since Black is strong in the bottom right a pincer at B or C is called for. D is another Idea. The variations show better alternatives.]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[jq]LB[bj:C][cl:B][cq:A]C[Now Black has lost his advantage of power at the bottom. With only 3 Stones White has made a stable group, while Blacks four stones create a position with three weak points (A-C).]
;B[lq]C[Question: or better at R9 or P3?
Answer: R9 and P3 have little impact on White, so M3 seems to be better. But since the bottom right group can develop to either side, it is big to play there but not urgent. another idea is to make a base at P18. But M3 is a good move as it invites a invasion which can be attacked.]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[oq];B[qr];W[op];B[po]C[Black plays well here, leaving White with a weak group.]

(;W[lo]LB[mo:A][mp:B]C[This capping move has a weak point at A. Another idea would be the shouler-hit at B. (See Var.)]

;B[rl];W[pn];B[ro];W[cq]
(;B[cp]LB[er:A]C[This move defends, but I can't exactly see what. A more active move woul be to attack the lower group with A. (see var).]
;W[er];B[dq];W[bj]
(;B[cj]C[Question: Is C10 too bad?
Answer: C10 is a good answer. The variations look at the alternatives.]
;W[bi];B[bk];W[bl]LB[ak:A]C[This move is very big. The questions is wether cutting with Black A works. (see Var)]

(;B[cl];W[ak];B[ck];W[dh];B[dr]C[Question: should Black play K12 or H12?
Answer: D2 takes compensation for the loss on the left side. It also secures a base. K12 or H12 are only reducing, threatening nothing serios. After e.g. H12, D2 or B7 becomes a big sente play for White. If he gets both of them the Black group at the bottom left would be in danger.]
;W[kh]C[This is a real multi-purpose move. Expanding the white moyo and aiming at the same time at an attack on Blacks upper right group.]

(;B[gh]C[Question: I was not sure about this move, maybe it is better to play at G11?
Answer: This move is too loose. It doesn't maintain a sure connection to friendly forces. Now the upper right Group becomes a burden. This is almost the same for G11. The wihte knights move at D12 has a weakness at C12. (See Var).]

;B[nh]C[what a mistake! N7 should be placed at once.];W[lm]
;B[mm];W[ll];B[mi];W[pi]C[white made the correct answer against the attention of N11. So I think black has no chance now.

I think so too. 
Most of your questions are dealing with reducing or invading moves. A reducing move is connected to friendly forces, an invasion has to live on its own. Since a invasion usually leads to a weak group one has to consider what  Richard Bozulich says in the introduction of "501 Opening Problems": "a weak group without eyes is worth minus 20 points, a weak group with only one eye is worth minus 10 points" 
So an invasion only makes sense if
1. it cannot be killed
2. it destroys more than 20 points of territory
or 3.  split the enemy, so that both get weak groups

So if you want to play in the sphere of the opponents influence make sure what you want: a reduction or an invasion and make sure the worth of it.
I recommend two books on this theme: "Reducing Territorial Frameworks" by Fujisawa Shuko and the above menteioned "501 Opening Problems".

Hope my comment was useful
