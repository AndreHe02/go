;B[pd]C[SSOCB [6k\]: hi

Hi, my names Neil and I'll be reviewing your game for both black and white, but mainly black as that's what you played.

I will show lost of variations that dont work and hopefully give you some good moves that do work.

It helps the review if you have any questions or put down what you were thinking, if your written English is good, or put in variations yourself.

(;B[dg]TR[dc][pd]LB[fe:A][gd:B][fd:C][cc:D]C[I am not sure about this pincer. Usually the pincer works if D4 is black or to stop white getting the side.

In this case using the triangle stones might be simpler and better.]

There are lots of other options, starting with a to d in the previous position.

;B[pj]CR[jd][pd][jp][np][dg]MA[cn]C[Personally I would play C6 here, but your move is OK. It is consistent with your other high stones so that is good.

All the circle stones are high so it is a consistent plan.]
;W[kb]
(;B[gp]C[Why not F3, which is one line more? It is another 4th line move. but there is no moyo yet, so it's a little bit dubious.]
;W[fq];B[cp];W[cq];B[gq]C[I dont like this move because it show lack of consistency in your plan when you played C4.

If you played G3 first and white played C3, would you have played C4? no. So this tewari analysis shows that you should have played G3 first, or continued your plan at C4.

C4 is a probe, not a bad move but white c5 makes it bad later.]

White has, 12 points in left corner, 16 points in right corner and 16 points at top, so 48 total.

This is very approximate.

However black has lots more influence and potential for more territory so we can say black is in the lead. Especially if he can get mybe F7.]
(;B[qd]C[It is difficult to know how to treat R14 stone. I think this is an ok move. Interesting would be F7]
;W[nc];B[qh];W[of]C[There is something wrong with these black moves. I can't figure it out, but they dont work very well together.

For instance white can Q18 and get take a lot of the corner, so it makes R16 look like a bad move.

Black can always link up with S14 but I feel something was missed by black, perhaps he should have tenuki F7.]

You definately had a lead early in the game and kept it throughout, apart from the endgame which was where you lost. So that is something to work on.

You also had a big potential to make a moyo in the middle which got lost. With your high 4th line plays and that style then i definately think this was what made the game close at the end.

The S7 mistake cost you lots. and F3 overconcentrated were the biggest mistakes.

White also got too much in the center because black was too submissive trying to take moyo territory. 

Sorry If I have rambled on and shown lots of useless variations. I hope some of this has helped you see some moves you like. Please remember to not take my moves as best.
Because Sometimes when I get reviews I think the reviewers moves i dont like! 

Happy go playing!
