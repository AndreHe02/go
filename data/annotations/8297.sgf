C[To whom it may concern: Thanks a bunch for reviewing my game.  I'd really like to know your thoughts on the opening.  Also, the fight in the lower left was problematic for me.  Any advice you can offer here would be great.

Thank you again for reviewing the game.

Elvard: Well, you won, what turning point are you talking about? :) White's death in lower rigt was huge, he doesn't have any compensation for it.

What I recommend is solving tsumegos (as usual). You need to improve your reading ability to see, what is kikashi (forcing move) and what is aji-keshi (wasting threat). Never play move, which does nothing but wasting threat and don't be afraid of oponnent's forcing moves, which don't make any advantages for him.]
