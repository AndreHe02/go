RE[B+2.50]

AB[dp][pd]C[I'm very new at this game and more or less feel like I'm neck deep in alligators at every point in the game.  Especially the opening.  I seem to do ok with actual tactics and fighting it out.  But I have trouble making territory in the process any tips would be appreciated thanks for taking the time in a review.

B:  Everyone feels like they're neck deep in alligators in the opening, I think.  I'm only 11k myself, but I'll try to help a little.  All of my comments will be marked with a B.]
;W[cd];B[pp];W[qn]C[Zwom [22k\]: have fun]
(;B[qo]LB[np:B][nq:C][pj:A]C[B: This move is odd.  It's usually played when there is a stone at A; otherwise, it doesn't seem to be great.  A play at B or C is standard; see the variations.]
;W[pk];B[mp];W[ro];B[pn]C[this to me seems to be a better move then protecting against the atari.

B: You are correct.];W[qp];B[po]C[plus this shape seems to let black in to one side or the other]
;W[qm];B[rp];W[rn];B[rq]LB[qq:A]C[B: I would capture at A instead; it leaves less aji, I think.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[B: This move again.  In this situation I would pincer.  See the variation.]

;W[cm];B[bn];W[en];B[do];W[gm];B[nc]LB[ec:C][jd:A][qg:B]C[B:  This is conservative.  A stone at the 4-4 point isn't for territory--the corner is wide open, so a play at A or B is more interesting, to me.  In addition, white's upper-left corner is incomplete.  A play at C could be fun.]
;W[qg];B[dm];W[dl];B[em];W[fn];B[el]C[B: You're spending too many stones here.  don't be afraid to let a few stones go.  Later, you may be able to use them in an attack elsewhere, but their survival is not imperative.]

;B[bi];W[ch];B[aj];W[fj];B[fk];W[ei];B[ek]LB[ak:A]C[better to just kill rather make such a cluster?  probably.

B:  Yes.  This is unnecessary, and leaves more aji than simply capturing.

(A bit on terminology:  you're not 'killing' the group if you play at A; you're capturing them.  They're already dead.)]
;W[gj];B[hl];W[jo]
(;B[ko]LB[lm:A]C[B: This response is a bit too close.  I would play at A or so.  It's not as securely connected, but you're strong here.  See the variations.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[km];B[lm];W[kl];B[hj]C[B: I don't like this move.  a play on the right seems better.  There also seems to be room to play around in the upper left; and your upper right corner is not secure.]

;W[oj];B[pl];W[qk];B[pm];W[ng];B[le];W[je];B[dc]C[from move 104 to move 124 the corner get's totally decided.  Is this common or does it imply we're looking at the game a bit to locally and not taking into consideration the rest of the board where more points might be had?

B: You left this a bit late for my taste.  Frankly, it seems to me that this should die.]
;W[eb]LB[cc:A]C[B:  White should play at A here.  Black is definitely at a disadvantage.]

B: Basically, you need to deny it eyespace.  The problem is that there's quite a bit of aji in this area, so it's easy to make an error...]

Your biggest issues seem to be everyone's biggest issues at this stage:  seeing the places where you can tenuki rather than spending stones, and playing slightly dangerous moves (S3, not capturing at A9).  Other than that, this was a pretty decent game on both sides.]
