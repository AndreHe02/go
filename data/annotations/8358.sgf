C[hello dear reviewer , im 1k player on kgs (hoping to get to 1 dan at the near future)

but among all my games there was always 1 big problem for me , and that is to play against the san-ren-sei .

in fact i probably havent won against san ren sei few years now , so probably my weakness lies somewhere in there.

i hope you can help me fix it once and for all and of cource if you see anything else do tell.

* Hi, I'm mafutrct, your reviewer. My comments start with an asterisk*

* I hope you dont mind if i get a bit harsh occasionally.];B[pd]

one idea is the invasion at s 10 , but im not sure i will live there , and even if i will it will probably hurt my r16 group especially with the weakness at R 15.
other idea is of cource kind of reduction like i played in the game   (any other moves/ideas possible?)

* no more comments

* white must learn to read deeper

* both players should try to find and use weaknesses like R14 earlier

* white should not create useless, heavy groups like E14. play light, or get good shape quickly.

* black does not understand moyo as shown by moves like P6.
