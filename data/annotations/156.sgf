TM[70 + 15/5]RE[B+Resign];B[cp];W[cc];B[pq];W[pd];B[po];W[jq]C[Is this move possible?
It may be possible, but I think F3 is better.];B[lq];W[ep]C[Maybe I'm just  asking for trouble?
If Black plays attach-and-draw-back joseki, my stone on at K3 would
be in the right place. But of course he doesn't...
This must be at G3.];B[gq];W[er];B[dn]
(;W[go]M[jq]L[fo]C[I know F5 [a\] is joseki, but  I wanted to use the pincer stone
(marked) for a fast attack. Bad idea?
E6 is another idea; see variation];B[hp];W[jo];B[ho];W[lp];B[cr];W[gn];B
[hn];W[en];B[do];W[mq]C[I thought this move gave me a safe and strong  group, but later
developments showed that it was much weaker than I had expected.];B[eo]
;W[fp];B[em];W[gm];B[hm];W[gl];B[dj];W[hl];B[jm];W[qm]C[According to my opponent,  this was the "losing move".
White must come out at M7 to protect his stones  and keep pressure on black.]
;B[om];W[pk];B[kq];W[kp];B[mr];W[nr];B[gp];W[fo]C[White should play L2 as a trade.]

C[This was very bad, I think. I still thought  of my group below as
"thickness", and when black makes a one point jump, he still leaves
a two point jump for me, which I thought I could break through,
backed up by my wall below. I was too optimistic.
Correct.  Must come out at M7.  But this game is already bad for white.]
;B[il];W[ik];B[lm];W[nm];B[nl];W[mm]C[Isn't there anything that works better than  this?
no.];B[ml];W[on];B[pn];W[ln];B[km];W[ol];B[pm];W[ll];B[mn];W[nn];B[no];W
[mo];B[oo];W[mn];B[ok];W[pl];B[mj];W[hr];B[gs]C[black H1 is better];W[js]
;B[ns];W[hs]L[kl]C[Maybe I should have played a semeai L8 [a\]
 instead of securing life?
The outcome should be seki at least, considering all the internal
liberties. I didn't notice this during the game, I was only happy
to live with my group.
Yes, L8 is good.  I think white wins the semiai because 1 eye to none.
The game result is very bad for white:  many white stones invested,  only 2 points of territory, and all black groups safe.]
;B[kl]C[black L9  is better];W[gj];B[kk]C[With black taking a lot of profit on the lower half,  I have to get
the most out of my corner stones in the top.];W[ch];B[oj];W[qi];B[nc];W
[qf];B[pb];W[kc]C[Aiming at a moyo in the top-left quarter.
M17 is more common];B[qc];W[hd];B[dh];W[di]C[Overplay? Since all ladders were  mine I thought I could play this way.
Yes, overplay.  D13 is better.  Black should atari at E11 and attack center  group.]
;B[ci];W[ei];B[cj];W[dg];B[gd];W[eh];B[hc];W[gc];B[ic];W[ge]C[I wanted  to grab as much as possible, but this crude move doesn't
work, and I lose the top left corner. Letting white capture either
cutting stone is very painful. Maybe it's too late to find
something that works?];B[fd];W[fc];B[fe];W[he];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[gb];B
[db];W[fa];B[dc];W[hb];B[cd];W[ff];B[da];W[ea];B[jd]C[Isn't black being a bit  greedy? He ought to win with the
territory he's already got. I least I felt that he gave me a second
chance here.
Black probably doesn't need this to win, but it is not unreasonable.];W

[lg];B[ng];W[kh]L[jg]C[Is K13 [a\] better?
Yes.];B[jh];W[ji];B[ki];W[li];B[kj];W[jg];B[ih];W[lc]L[ig]C[Didn't work. I  suppose J13 [a\] is the move.
Yes, J13 is better.  Can't save both sides.];B[kf];W[ig];B[kg];W[lh];B[mi]
;W[rd]C[A last desperate effort - trying to kill white's corner.];B[qd]
