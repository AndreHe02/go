C[^__^ Hello, this is Hikaru79, and I'll be reviewing your game for you. It's my first time reviewing, so be gentle! ^^ I've tried to be as accurate as possible, and take into account things that a 28k should know. =) I hope you find it enlightening!
Enjoy!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed];W[ec]
(;B[dd]C[[Hikaru79\]: This move is not really appropriate for the situation. It's allowing white too much clearance on your right side. I've given a variation for a joseki that would work really well with your Q16 stone.]
;W[dc];B[ce];W[bd];B[df]C[D14 is not really neccesary. The cut at D15 must be defended, but F16 does a better job of it.]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[ge];B[gd];W[fc]
(;B[he]C[This is probably the wrong direction. After white extends, black has two weak stones pressed up against white thickness. See the variation for an alternative to H15.]
;W[gf];B[hd];W[ee];B[de];W[ef];B[eg];W[ff];B[be];W[dg]
(;B[ad]C[A16 is jeapordizing your whole C15 group. See varation for B27]
;W[bc];B[fg];W[cg];B[hg]C[H13 is going to be easily cut. Both F13 and H16 are weak groups, but H13 is not going to connect them. However, this move could have turned out to be a good move depending on the variation, by sacrificing either one of the groups. See the two variations.]

(;B[eq]C[Just like your other corner, E3 is too passive. It is OK if white had a presence at Q4, but it is black who has a stone there. See variation for joseki that work better with Q4.]
;W[ep];B[kp];W[qf];B[fk];W[dk]C[Because of W58, G11 is weak. Attacking at G9 is very profitable for black now.]

(;B[pi];W[of]LB[qc:a]C[Meatex: I don't know what to do about these kinds of moves.

Hikaru79: Well, it certainly is an unusual move. "a" is much more common. The variation shows what I would do, but it may not be right.]

(;B[gk];W[ij];B[hj];W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[Wrong direction. You're letting R17 connect, thus putting your stones in even more danger. Variation shows what R16 would have done.

As a general rule, when opponent uses 3-3 invasion, block on the side where you want to make thickness, or the side where the opponent cannot connect.]

;W[md];B[kb];W[lg];B[mf];W[lf]
(;B[og]C[Right now, your only chance to live with this group is to either connect to Q11 or kill N16. For the moment, N16 is safe. Therefore, you should try to connect to Q11. P13 is a move that can easily be cut (and was). See variation for a better way to connect.]
;W[ng];B[rf];W[rg];B[qg];W[sf];B[pg];W[rf];B[mg];W[nh];B[mh]
;W[lh]C[A mistake that you took full advantage of -- good job! ^^]
;B[ni];W[ii];B[hi];W[mi];B[oh];W[mj];B[ka];W[dq];B[hp]C[D3 is a severe move that must be answered, I agree. However, H4 is too high an extension. See variation for what white could have done to punish H4.]

(;W[qn];B[pl];W[ql];B[pm];W[qm];B[ke]LB[pn:a]C[I do not think the time is ripe for a tenuki yet. The R7 group still is very powerful, and can cut your Q7 and Q4 stones if you're not careful. Meanwhile, L15 is a forcing move without much value. I suggest playing [a\] first, and then tenuki.

By the way, in case you had not learned this bit of go terminology yet, tenuki means to play elsewhere, away from a local fight. Although this can be a good strategy to keep your opponent off his/her balance, it can also be overdone. tenuki'ing just because your opponent made a move you do not understand is not good. As mitdahand 3-dan once said, playing tenuki against an unusual move can make it the best move there is for your opponent.

If I accidently use any other Go terminology you do not understand, check http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoTerms to find the definition. However, I'll try to stay away from words that  28k has not encountered yet.]
;W[le];B[kf];W[kg];B[jg];W[jh];B[ig];W[qp];B[po];W[nq];B[nj]
C[Again, tenuki too soon. The O3 stone is VERY dangerous if allowed to connect to R4. Q3 is essential.]

(;W[mk];B[nk];W[no]LB[mm:b][pq:a]C[[Meatex[\]: Another move i didn't know how to deal with. so i played else where.

[Hikaru79\]: O5 is a very strong move, and O10 is to blame for it. Now [a\] and [b\] are miai to give you a big headache. I would probably play [a\] here. Tenuki'ing to a good move is generally a bad idea ^^;]
;B[hb];W[hc];B[gc];W[gb];B[ic];W[fb];B[ia];W[kr];B[jr]C[There is a proverb that says not to attach to weak stones, because it will make them stronger. This is doubly true in places where you are short of liberties, and the second line is a very liberty-less place. As such, you are setting yourself up for trouble with K2.]
;W[jq];B[kq]C[j2];W[ir]
(;B[iq]C[You want to keep this group from connecting to O3. Playing J3 is aji-keshi. That means, it's removing the potential of the K2 stone to go out with a bang before it dies. See variation for a better way to handle L2.]
;W[jp];B[jo];W[js];B[hr];W[gq];B[ip]C[Good response! Most beginners would have defended the peep at H3 in a heartbeat, but J4 is undoubtedly a better response! ^^]
;W[jr];B[fr];W[gp];B[gr];W[hq];B[io];W[lr];B[qo];W[qq];B[pq]
C[You switched plans halfway! R5 aims to cut, at the expense of letting white extend. If you're going to do that, then finish the cut, don't try to block the extension too! What i'm trying to say is, don't switch plans halfway. S5 would have been better.]
;W[ro]C[Now white has achieved both of his goals-- he is connected, and he has gotten his extension.]
;B[qr];W[rr];B[rn];W[rp];B[ps];W[ko]C[The cut at Q6 is a looming danger that neither player seems to notice...]
;B[go];W[fo];B[pn]C[^_^ Ah, you got it! Good!];W[qk];B[pk];W[qj]

(;B[kd]C[[Meatex\] Should of gone d1 instead.
 but i guess it doesn't matter seeing by how much i was beaten.

[Hikaru79\]: Indeed, D1 would have saved you.];W[ki];B[ik];W[hl]
;B[jj];W[ji];B[kj]C[L10 is not sente, I don't know why white responded. But H9 is a VERY big cut that would most likely decide the winner.]
;W[lj];B[kk];W[ml];B[nl];W[hk]C[Now a huge battle begins. There's really not much to say about it. It would be hard for ANYBODY to come out on top from such a difficult battle. If you had defended the cut, it would have been much easier for you. As it stands, You did not lose the fight out of any large mistake that I can find, but simply beacuse of it's genuine difficulty. 

Let's just take this opportunity to count the current score, and judge how the players are doing. See variation.]

;B[pj];W[op];B[oq];W[oo];B[cb]C[[Meatex\] I was almost able to kill this group.

[Hikaru79\]: Yeah, you came close. Unfortunatly, I think this group is unconditionally alive.]
;W[cc];B[ab];W[bb];B[ac];W[af]C[If it wasn't for black's shortage of liberites, this move would be a mistake.. I think.]

;B[el];W[bk];B[em];W[fn];B[bi];W[aa];B[tt];W[pa]C[[Meatex\]: Got flogged.

[Hikaru79\]: Not really "flogged." The score was quite far apart, but it wasn't because of a general lack in skill-- it was just a couple of large mistakes, most notably in the bottom right, and center. Moves like H9, O5 and S5 must not be allowed to happen, and all three of those could have been prevented, but you tenuki'd. Although there is a proverb "When in doubt, Tenuki," it is not set in stone, and in this game, cost you. My suggestion is, whenever you get the urge to tenuki, consider all the possible things your opponent could do with your half-finished position, and make sure you can deal with those consequences. Other than that, you seem to be doing fine for a 28k! ^__^]

[ok]C[Again, I'm going to leave that center out of the counting, as it could go either way, although it's looking much better for white.

BLACK: 24 Territory + 10 captures = 34 points

WHITE: 99 Territory + 25 caputes + 6 komi = 130 points

Therefore, white is leading by about 96 points here. To make this a close game, it is vital that you live in the center, and possible save that bottom group with D1.]
