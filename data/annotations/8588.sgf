C[astralos [7k\]: hi, gg

J: Hi my name is Jay, and my comments will start with "J:".]
;B[pd]C[stivel [6k\]: hi, gg];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ic]C[J: so far so good.]
;W[jp]TR[dg][df]C[J: the approach for white at marked points are more common.  This to keep black's moyo in check.]
;B[cn];W[dk];B[bp]C[J: Black's slide at B4 is wierd because black can usually extend to C9, but that's not possible with D9 already played. White can choose to giveup the corner and play D6 to expand his moyo.

A better order of moves would be to play E6 first to seaparate D9.]
;W[cq];B[bq]C[J: B3 is too early, I would still consider E6 to break up white's moyo.]
;W[br]
(;B[bk]C[J: should still be E6, see variation.];W[cm]C[J: a great move by white to keep black low.]
;B[bm];W[cl];B[bl];W[dn]C[B: i think my group is safe for now, responding at C5 would be too small, I thought.

J: correct, but white is happy to keep black low this way.]
;B[nq]TR[pj][qn]C[J: this approach is agressive but ok, marked points are alos possible.]
;W[oq];B[qn]C[B: should I have attacked from this side right away?

J: The aji O3 is good to have.  R6 is a good change of direction.]
;W[np];B[oo]TR[pk]C[J: P5 is hurting O3's aji.  backing off at Q9 is better.]
;W[mq];B[pj]C[B: now I have 2 moves for white's capture of my O3 stone. Was that a good trade?

J: this is ok for black.  another way to think about this is: if P5 wasn't played, N3 may be played later and white's bottom would be destroyed; but that option is no longer available.]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[B: I wanted to protect the side where invested more already. Is that the good stategy?

J: It's difficult to say which is the better direction.  The right side has better potential for development, but the top is wider.  Either is ok.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]
;W[jk];B[ec]TR[df][dg][mj][ed]C[B: they always tell me: corners and sides first. So this looked better than respoinding around O10

J: E17 feels a little slow.  consider the marked points instead.]
;W[nj]TR[lk][lj]C[J: consider cutting O10 off immediately.]
;B[op];W[nr];B[po]C[B: trying to make my wall more solid first]
;W[qp];B[nl]C[J: O8 is way too slow, cutting at M9 is still good.]
;W[nf]C[B: after this, my move O8 looks a bit pointless.];B[lf]
C[B: so I now try to respond on the other side.];W[ph];B[oi]
;W[ni];B[oh];W[nh];B[og];W[ng]
(;B[if]TR[fj]MA[dj][fl]C[B: now white even gave me sente. But I'm not happy with my move here.

J: it's another slow move.  how about F10, it' makes D10 and F8 miai.  black is definately behind, so something extrodinary is needed; maybe just plop a stone at H3.]
;W[kg]TR[jd][kd][ke][je][ek][fk][gk][hk][ik][jl][jm][jn][jo]
C[J: there's only 4 points here.  poking at the white boundary is more important.]
;B[kf];W[jg];B[ok];W[ml];B[mm];W[ll];B[nk];W[lj]C[J: white doesn't need to respond.]
(;B[jf]C[B: again, this was not good, was it?

J: correct, but black is still behind and needs to reduce white's bottom/center.]
;W[lm];B[mn];W[ln];B[cg];W[ro];B[rn];W[sn];B[sm];W[so];B[rm]
;W[gh];B[gf]TR[ej]C[J: black should press into white's territory, white stands to lose more than black.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[eg];B[ef];W[dg];B[df]TR[cf]C[J: C14 is better.  black will keep the left side.]
;W[ch];B[bg];W[ci];B[hh];W[ih]C[J: this doesn't work for white, white has to defend at H11.  see variation.]
(;B[ig];W[hi];B[hg];W[ji]C[B: from here I think it was endgame. Should I have tried to reduce or invade earlier? Or somehow make my terrory a bit bigger? A few moves ago I thought it was pretty even.

J: After white pushed all the way to O14, i think black was behind by about 20 points.  we see now why E6 was so important.]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[mo];W[lp];B[lo];W[ko];B[mb];W[cp]TR[co]C[J: white should C5 instead.]

[ss]C[White wins by 16.5 points.

J: I think the main problem in this game for black was letting white grow too big.  We really see why E6 was so important early; to keep white to the bottom of the board.

So, I think you're thinking about moyos incorrectly.  The point of a moyo in'st to take territory, but to make an area so big that the other player has to invade.

Of course, the bset way to counter a moyo style of play is just to keep him from building the moyo in the first place.

Thanks for showing me this game.])
