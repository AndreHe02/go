C[Denis: As usual, I tried to make my best for this review but don't take my comment as the only true.]
;B[pp]C[Andy Foran
kiseki (black)

I would like to thank the reviewer of this game, I hope you enjoy it.
This is one of the only games out of my previous 100 games that I feel is worthy of review.]
;W[dd];B[pd];W[cp];B[jc];W[eq];B[cj]LB[dj:A]C[I know my opening is very weak.  This is partly because my invasion and reduction is weak, and I strive to separate my opponents stones as quickly as possible to prevent them from becoming a large moyo that I don't know exactly where to attack

Denis: better at A.];W[cg];B[cm];W[fd];B[jq];W[lq];B[nq];W[lo]
;B[jo];W[lm];B[gq]C[perhaps g4 creates the proper shape, but I didn't realise that until the next move

Denis: I don't think so. This seems good for me.];W[fo];B[ho]
LB[jm:A]C[Denis. However, this is overconcentrated. Keep going outside at A.]
;W[gm];B[jm];W[di];B[dj];W[fi];B[en]LB[bo:A]C[Denis: Not good. You cannot cut white and connect your 2 (weak) groups. Better make life shape at A]
;W[gn];B[hc]LB[je:A]C[I often have toruble finding the biggest move.  And I feel uncomfortable leaving a stone such as k17 by itself.

Denis: not good. Too small. If you want to extend your moyo on the top, play at A.]
;W[gc];B[hd]LB[je:A]C[Denis. Bad. Overconcentrated. This stone is not working. Still better at A.]
;W[pj];B[qm]C[Denis: May be too far. And I think that the corner is still open to attack.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[qq]C[Denis: white takes the risk.];B[qp];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[rr];B[sp];W[nr];B[or];W[oq];B[pq];W[pr];B[op];W[os]
;B[mr];W[oq];B[mq];W[rq];B[or];W[pm];B[ql];W[on];B[po];W[pl]
;B[nl]LB[qs:A]C[Denis: Strange? r1 is not yet working but should be kept in mind.]
;W[nm];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk];W[mm];B[kl];W[nk];B[nj];W[ok];B[lj]
;W[mi];B[mj];W[ni];B[oj];W[oi];B[qf]C[Denis: Not that big. And you have still a weak group on the left. May be better to play there first.]
;W[qh];B[pc]C[Denis: secure the corner, but slow.];W[nd];B[nc]
LB[mc:A]C[Denis: avoid attacking with a contact. This will always make your opponent stronger. Better at A.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[ld];B[me];W[nb];B[oc];W[lb];B[kc]C[Denis: You make white stronger and you don't have a good shape. This exchange is not good for you.]
;W[lc];B[ob];W[ke];B[ne];W[jf];B[hf];W[hh];B[ig];W[jh];B[ih]
;W[ii];B[jg];W[kg];B[ji];W[kh];B[hi];W[ij];B[gh];W[hj];B[gi]

;W[ei];B[gd];W[fe];B[fc];W[dh];B[hg];W[ec];B[fb];W[eb];B[gb]
MA[kc]C[Denis: This fight was clearly a win for White. You struggle for a small life and white took a very big corner! And this is may be the consequence of the move 85 (X). Go back to this move and check the bad shape you had and the result.]
;W[ef];B[ek];W[kj];B[li];W[lh];B[ki];W[jj];B[lk];W[km];B[il]
C[later, i question if I should have played k8 to prevent k8 from becoming such a massive ko threat

Denis: you are correct.];W[hl];B[qk]C[Denis: you still have a weak group on the left. It should be deal with as soon as possible.]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[ol];B[le]C[I had a lot of trouble figuring out when to play o19

Denis: why. This is not a big move. play it during yose. As of now, this is certainly not a priority.]
;W[kd];B[lf]C[this move should have been saved for a later ko threat

Denis: indeed.];W[kf];B[mg]C[Denis: and this one also.];W[mh]
;B[ri];W[rk];B[rm];W[qi];B[rh];W[pg];B[oh];W[og];B[ph];W[na]
C[Denis: now, in fact,  that was necessary.];B[ng];W[nh];B[qg]
;W[kr];B[lp];W[kp];B[kq]LB[jp:A]C[Denis: you are playing with fire. Better connect at A.]
;W[mp];B[lr];W[jp];B[ip];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir];B[lp];W[ko];B[hq]
C[This at j6 or k6 or h4 would have given me a better chance  in the ensuing battle

Denis: I think it's too late anyway.];W[jn];B[in];W[io];B[hp]
;W[hn];B[jo];W[jl];B[jk];W[io];B[qr];W[qs];B[jo];W[kk];B[jl]
C[right now I knew that the chances of the m9 group surviving were slim, but I knew that my chances of winning were worse without it]

;W[pi];B[ps];W[rl];B[qo];W[qr]C[i knkow it is pure luck that my opponent made this mistake, I should have been destroyed here

Denis: Very strange indeed. But white is still ahead. May be he thought he could give this up and told you so by killing himself :-)]
;B[os];W[fr];B[hr];W[cn];B[dn];W[bn];B[bm];W[ci];B[bj];W[bi]
;B[fj]C[Denis: strange. Do you expect white to do a second big mistake?]
;W[fk];B[ej];W[fl];B[el];W[do];B[eo];W[ep];B[kb];W[jd];B[id]
;W[oe];B[nf]C[I was getting greedy because I knew I couldn't give up a point, and I was hurt even worse as a result

Denis: Your biggest mistake of the end-game!];W[pe];B[od];W[qe]
C[Denis: Arggg! You should give up now. It's useless to continue, you cannot win.]

I appreciate everything you can tell me about this game.  Thanks again!

Denis: Didn't had much to say. May be too much slow moves at the beginning. and too greedy in the middle. Hope you have learn something.]
