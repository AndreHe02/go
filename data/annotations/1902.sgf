Simen: I had second thoughts about this move. After I played it, I was reluctant to extend from the shimari on the lower side, for fear that my stones might end up overconcentrated. Besides, should it be closer to the W stones on the left side? Maybe I should have approached the upper left corner instead, and settled myself on the lower side if W approached my corner stone?]

This move isn't bad but so plain .   Around of the corner has a big advantage. so, Black should care a sequence .]

Simen: This was probably a bit premature? Maybe I should have played either to secure the corner or made a move on the lower side?

Simen: Is this good, or should I have pressed with P3 or somesuch move? I felt I had already positioned me pretty high, and that I should at least grab some territory.

Simen: This felt like a weird move. Is it any good? White ends up with a settled group, and my potential territory on the upper side vanishes.

Simen: I guess the middle game starts about now. Maybe my greatest mistake in this game was that I played to centre-focused in the yose? None of Whites groups are particulary weak, and I haven't really any proper thickness to brag about either, only some thin influence. I never caught up with White's territorial lead.]

Simen: I don't know if this is good timing. I know you aren't supposed to "secure" territory when your skirts are up, but I figured that as I could play this in sente, it could do no harm.]

Simen: Is this premature? It pretty much settles things, so there's not much left for me to do here after I've made this exchange. Also, it seems to me now that I could have (waited and) played at G18 instead?

Simen: This move was more or less a preparation for playing P1, threatening the cut at O3 if W answered at O1. However, during the game I couldn't figure out what would happen if B:P1, W:01, B:O3, W:Q1, B:N1 and W enters the corner, so I never pulled myself together into actually playing it before W did...
On closer inspection, it seems that W dies if he answers B:P1 this way (see variation), so he would probably just answer it with O2.]
