;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]C[You might try the Chinese  fuseki at r9 instead.]
;W[dj];B[jq];W[qj];B[fc]C[lentugo: I was not sure,  if R8 or R13 were better.

Either move would be OK, but f17 is not a bad move. The question is  whether you keep sente.]
;W[cf];B[jd];W[nc];B[qg]C[So you get to take r13  anyway.];W[qm]
;B[pb];W[ld];B[kb]C[lentugo: I wanted to rob white of his  base, but nevertheless it looks a bit strange to me.
Is F3 or so better?

f3 is the correct direction but the desire to attack white is strong as  well. So L18 is not bad. I may have taken m17 instead.]
;W[lg];B[fq];W[cn];B[fo];W[im];B[on]C[I may have approached white's group on the  right at q11 instead. As white defends you build up influence to use  against his top group.]
;W[ln];B[mp]C[lentugo: I was not sure, what to do  here. Maybe D18 or F15 are more
important.

This move gives you a good chunk of territory around the corner. Your  investment in the corner enclosure is paying off.

Your confusion is buying white outside influence. When I don't know how  to respond, I try to think of my goals and move toward  those.]
;W[ho];B[jo]C[lentugo: Again i wasn't sure, what to do.

I would have taken g3 or g4 instead. White g3 would split your territory  on the bottom and make the two stones on f very weak.]
;W[jm];B[ne];W[ke];B[md];W[lc];B[mc];W[lb];B[kc];W[mb];B[nd]
;W[je];B[id];W[hf]C[White is building some good influence in the center. It will be  difficult to break into this.]
;B[ek];W[fm]C[Black would like f7 but now  white g3 is very dangerous.]
;B[cl];W[dk];B[dm];W[dl];B[cm];W[dn];B[bn];W[bo];B[co];W[cp]
;B[en];W[do];B[em];W[el]C[Black has connected but g3  is still a threat. In addition, white has cut off access to the center  from the bottom.]
;B[ee];W[eg]C[White seals off the center again.];B[db];W[cc]
;B[pi];W[pj];B[oi]C[See how this sequence would have helped before  the attack on white's top group?]
;W[mi]C[White makes another effort to  seal off the center.]
;B[nj];W[mj];B[pl]C[A good move to weaken and  possibly kill this white group.]
;W[ql];B[rn];W[rm];B[ri];W[rj];B[nl]C[lentugo: Now I think P9 would have been better  and had killed white group.

P9 is better shape. You can still kill the white group, s9 is the key  point.]
;W[qi];B[rh];W[qh];B[pg];W[ok];B[nk];W[ol];B[pm];W[om];B[pn]
C[Q6 is not needed. If black seals at o7 and  white takes q6, black takes r6. After white captures, black throws in at  q7 to remove the extra eye. The problem is that black still needs to  take s9 to kill the group and lacks sente. In either case, the alternate  sequence prevents white from connecting  groups.]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[mm];B[lm];W[ll];B[dr];W[hq];B[gp];W[hp];B[bq]
C[This is a good  move.];W[bm];B[bl];W[an];B[al];W[cr];B[cq]
;W[dq];B[br];W[er];B[cs];W[eq];B[fr];W[am];B[bi];W[es];B[ds]
;W[fs];B[hr];W[gs];B[gm]C[Black needs g2 or j2 to keep white from  connecting out.]
;W[gl];B[hn]C[lentugo: This and G7 before were  nonsense.];W[in]
;B[io];W[gn];B[bg];W[bf];B[bj];W[ch];B[ck];W[ak];B[gr];W[lo]
C[lentugo: I think white J2  would have been a problem for me.

No. After white j2, black j3 removes any possibilities for  white.]
;B[ir];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[lp];W[ko];B[cg]C[lentugo: probably N5 had been better

Probably, yes. It keeps sente, if nothing  else.];W[dg];B[bh]
;W[no];B[df];W[de];B[ef];W[bd];B[ed];W[fg];B[cb]C[If black plays b18 here, the progression is  interesting and has a chance of killing the white corner.

White must fight the impulst to play c18. If he does so, then b should  connect at c19 and then not answer at b19 if white should play b17.  Instead, a black play at c15 would kill the white group.

In fact, the best response after black b18 seems to be white c15,  guaranteeing two eyes.]
;W[bb];B[np]C[M5 is better here. After white  connects, p4 prevents the creep into your corner  territory.]
;W[oo];B[op];W[po];B[qn];W[pp];B[qp];W[ng];B[kd];W[me];B[mf]
C[lentugo: Of course, this should  have been at P13 or so.]
;W[le];B[nf];W[ni];B[oj];W[ph];B[oh]C[lentugo: This was stupid. Q9 was better, then i had at  least got the Q5 group.]

;W[fe];B[ap]C[A4 aims at the three stones at a7 but is too  slow because of white b4]
;W[bp];B[aq];W[ao];B[di];W[ci];B[fk];W[fl];B[cj];W[dh];B[ei]
;W[fd];B[dc];W[ff];B[ec];W[ka];B[ja];W[la];B[ib];W[si];B[rg]
;W[mo];B[sm];W[rl];B[af];W[be];B[qq];W[sl];B[nn];W[sn];B[ip]
C[lentugo: Simply T5 had been better.

Right. You need to give up sente to save the stones at j5. This costs  you about 5 points.]

;W[ks];B[ms];W[fp];B[js]C[Just a few bad moves  this game brought you close to losing. You did well securing territory,  but white's influence in the center almost won the  game.]
