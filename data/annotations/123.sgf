(;W[nn]C[Black can now attack the thinness of the white group at q7 or r7 in sente,  white will
not die from that but will suffer from perhaps for the rest of the game.]

(;B[lp];W[pf]C[This could become a heavy move and is a little unreasonable as  long as black can force the
lower white group. Perhaps R14 is easier to handle but I am not sure.];B

(;B[jd]C[This move force white to connect and help the black stones that not  are in danger.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[cb]C[This is too aggressive, white should  play J15. It is good to play vital points like
C18 but you can only play one move at a time in go and if you want to attack  you have to  defend your own weak groups first.]

 fursa 5k : is entering byo-yomi];B[ff];W[gg]C[White is pushing black  into the area which was likely to be dominated by white.
If white had played J15 first then white perhaps could have played F13  building up the side
instead.];B[fi];W[ci];B[gh]C[White tries to play on both sides but the result  is a strong black center group and a very
weak white group. The balance of power is clearly to blacks advantage. Even  if the  territorial balance is fairly even.]

;B[oc];W[nb];B[nd];W[md];B[ng];W[nf];B[pi];W[og];B[lm]C[This is a very bad move on principle.
1 It is close to blacks superior thickness
2 It looks like black think he can kill white which is dangerous
3 If black plays R6 or R7 or something white has to run with his group and it  will
be killed or give black the oppurtunity to turn the lower side into territory  and  waste the lower left.
When one has thickness like this one has to plan using it as far away from it  as possible.]

[ro];B[qn];W[qm];B[pn];W[om];B[pm];W[pl];B[ol];W[rn];B[on];W[sp]C[The result  from attacking white with M7 is that white becomes stronger relatively
(he has no weak group) and black got the possibility to get some 15 points  with P5 in gote.
White can also aim at wP9 bO7 wP10 Or wP5 b07 w05.
This is good example of why one should not play close to thickness];B[fq]
;W[eq]C[I think white should play F4 or F5 since the center looks to big now  compared to
the corner.];B[fp];W[cn];B[ck];W[dl]C[Good move, black is forced to push  white into the center if black wants to save the stone.]

 fursa 5k : really?
 fursa 5k : right missed it, maybe too late for me.

Now, the game is over due to too many tactical mistakes by black.
White overplayed a lot in the fuseki but white is also probably a stronger
reader and fighter and got back into the game.   Black should try to eliminate his big mistakes to improve.
White should try to play more patiently in the beginning.];B[hm]C[
