;B[qd]C[Hello reviewer!  Thank you for reviewing my game.

I have been in quite a slump lately.  My rank has been saddling 4k and 3k for the past several months - winning all my games as a 4k but losing all my games as 3k.

Most recently, I have lost about 8 straight as a 4k.  I've been a little jetlagged and impatient I think, so in this game (as White) I deliberately tried to be more level-headed and peaceful.  But I still lost.  Help!

I've made comments throughout this file, trying to explain my thought process.  Please comment as much as possible - I value your feedback very much.

Thank you again,
BW


--> Hi I'm 1d on KGS. I'll try my best.

--> when you start losing many games.. you need a little break or play on a different server. 
try not to think about wining or losing too much. often that helps.]
;W[dd];B[pq]
(;W[od]LB[oc:A][dp:B]C[As W or B, I try to push the action in the opening rather than let my opponent do so.

--> this strategy is fine. Historically allowing black p17 is unthinkable so white approaches first.  but not today when there is komi.   if you want a change, try my approach.  be flexible, Let your opponent choose the action and play to frustrate his plan.

--> P16 Certainly possible, although A also possible (shusaku style). I prefer D4, taking an empty corner.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc]LB[dq:A]C[--> both sides want to get sente in this corner to play lower left.   As black i'll play C4 immediatly without p17 and all this. 


--> As white, i'll take sente now.  I would treat top right lightly as forcing moves and claim the empty corner next (A).  i don't want to lose sente in top right corner. but that just my style. see variation.

choose A because black wants to approach from the right to expand.  with A white denies black good move.]

(;W[nd];B[qf];W[jd]LB[cp:A]C[I'm glad my opponent choose this joseki, because it worked well with my star point.

--> .  I think black actually chose a good joseki here. black plays A next.  He ended in sente and be the first to play in  3 corners. 
And black's terrirtory is solid.];B[cp]C[-->I don't like this result that's why i prefer to have white in bottome left corner.

--> even with the star point and k16 o16 influence, you can't help feeling that white doesn't develop fast enough]

(;W[eq];B[hp];W[en];B[cm];W[jp];B[hn]LB[dl:A][dp:B][cq:C]C[--> be careful not to let black runs into the top moyo.

joseki moves A, B or C but i don't know much abou these josekis so no comment on the result.]

(;W[cr];B[em];W[hr];B[dn];W[qo]C[Appropriate tenuki?  I felt safe in the lower left.

-->yes];B[mq];W[hq]LB[ql:A][cf:B][qk:C]C[This better than, say, A?

--> A is ok, C14 also good. 

The right side is not interesting for either player.   so black should deal with the top.]

;B[kr];W[qj]LB[iq:B][jo:A]C[I felt that A and B were mai so I couldn't connect, so I shifted focus to using my wall.

However, now I see that A works.

--> k3k4 are not important, all groups are alive, cutting stones don't worth much.]

[iq][ip][jr]LB[jk:A]C[Appropriate tenuki, or is somthing in lower right more urgent?

-->stopping black groupis more urgent. if it is strong then white will suffer on both sides of it.

Isn't it the purpose of black's cut at k2? i wonder .. maybe black forgot why he cut there. 

For black, I would play something like black A . if white cuts around L9 black will escape to the right and white p10 r10 will suffer.]

(;W[di]MA[ik][jj][ki][li][mh][ng][nf]LB[eh:C][lk:A][nk:B]C[To protect the cut.

--> C is the shape to protect the cut.

I feel at this point that the game is still promising for me, but I guess that there are still weak groups I need to look after.

At this point what should my strategy be?  How can I best use my thickness while taking care of the lower right?


--> Not d11 now. 
you must close black on the right side.  you can peep at B first. Go back and see variation.  both sides have forgotten the most urgent area which is about the n8 group.

-->After right side is settled  you probably will get another wall along the x marks.  if black cuts d13 it's ok to atari from e13 to close a huge territory.  you might even end the right side in sente then you can come back to protect the cut.]

yes];W[pj];B[li];W[ni]TR[qj][pj][oj]C[Now it seems silly that I'm trying to save the marked group, because it's ruining my territory in the middle.]

Do you have any closing remarks?

Thanks again for reviewing my game.

--> I just gave you my ideas. I hope they're useful.  In the game, it's best to ask yourself what do you want and what your opponent wants, pretend to be your oppenent.  why you or your opponents play such moves?  how would you counter those moves..?

I still need to work on this myself.  Often you play your own game and forget about your opponent. but Go is a two-people's game.

i didn't comment endgame coz i'm no good so it's better i don't give advice.]
)
(;W[nk];B[nl];W[lk]C[--> white is quite nice. black might still lives but white will get big center area.]

(;B[jk]))
(;W[dp]))
(;W[iq]))
(;W[dq];B[nd];W[qn]LB[mc:A]C[-->if black cuts, you accept loss in top right corner but you develop faster.  stones are not totally dead there. You can pull out at n17 later, black n17 now will be slow.  it's black 4 against white 2 stones so the result is acceptable.]
))
(;W[dp]C[--> This I like as white, more center oriented.  lots of variations]

(;B[fc];W[cf];B[kc]C[mini-chinesse is a fun way to play both as black and white.]

(;B[oc];W[po]C[i prefer white in this opening i think black is slower.]
