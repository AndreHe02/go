AB[pd][dp][pp]C[VIEGAS [22k?\]: boa sorte
nevsky88 [26k\]: hello! good game :)

GV: Hello , I am Gabriel, 13k EGF, I will do my best to comment the game.]
;W[ee]C[GV: I consider this a little bit high, but still often played - probably a good idea in a handicap game to get some outside influence]
;B[jj]TR[jd][dj][pj][jp]C[GV: As B is playing a handicap game, B usualy shoud build some strong influence or territory and let W bothering about invasions.  This move could be a good investment if B could use it to extend it's own territory or moyo and take other bug points (usualy stars).]
;W[jd];B[ld]C[GV: this is a good way to defend , even there are big points around to take first]
;W[dj]
(;B[fj]TR[pj][pk][jp][jq]SQ[ld]C[GV: B prevents W to extend, but W has better moves than F/G10. B should rather take advantage of his handicap and build stronger moyo (influence). After nice M16, it would be good to protect the gained moyo  (influence) or get some more. 

Attack is often the best deffence, but this move didn't make much damage to W, so W corretly can ignore the move and take big points elsewhere, so K10 is not placed as good as it was in the beginning. Personally I'd prefer K3 or K4]
;W[jp]C[GV: nice, good time and place to take big points];B[dk]
C[GV: there's a proverb - don't attach a weak stone. It will only make W stronger]
;W[pj];B[ej]TR[pj][jp]SQ[dd][ed][de][pg][qg][pm][qm][gp][mp]
[gq][mq]C[GV: I consider B's attack is too soon and too weak , W can be graceful for big points K4 and Q10..]

[ec][dd][pg][pm][gp][hp][mp][gq]C[GV: B forced W to create a nice teritory, B has more or less the last opportunity to do something about it.]
;W[gg];B[hh]TR[dd][pg][pm][gp][mp];W[ig];B[bj];W[bi];B[bk]
(;W[aj]TR[ci][di]C[GV: W left several weak points   and sooner or later will have to connect the the stones , so end up in gote (will loose tempo). If W wants to close his teritory, simple and and strong connection would do it.]

;B[ag]
(;W[af]TR[bf]C[GV: This leaves a very severe opening]
(;B[bi];W[pm]C[GV: good, about  time to leave the wall];B[jg]
TR[cc][bf][pg][gp][nq]C[GV: there's another proverb - Play away from thickness 
Sensei's library comments it as follows:
When the opponent has a thick group in some part of the board, do not play close to that group, but stay away from it. A stone played close to a thick group will come under attack easily, while it doesn't affect the status of the group at all.

When you have yourself a thick group in some part of the board, do not play close to that group, but play far away from it. A stone played close to your own thick group will only add marginal strength and hence is not efficient but leads to overconcentration.

B cannot do much about the W wall anymore, should calm down and build more moyo or territory]
;W[jf];B[kf];W[je];B[ih]TR[gp][mp][fq][nq]SQ[cc][bf];W[kc]C[GV: now W is safe enough to grab more, even leaving some holes behind.. I'd advice W to go G4 to diminish the B's wall influence]
;B[lc];W[lb];B[le];W[ke];B[lf];W[mc];B[md];W[nc]
(;B[jc]TR[oc][pc][pg][ph][gp][mp][np][fq][gq][mq][nq]C[GV: I still feel there's a lot of place to build before fighting. From time to time is good to see the board as whole (often I forget this myself). W built some territory on the top (with few holes, but safe), few stones to build stable base, B has a big wall across the board and few stones on strategic points (corners). So B should take advantage of his wall and and e.g. G4/F4 would equalize W's already built territory.]

(;B[cf]TR[bf]C[GV: if B wants to attack, then he should look after a cutting point]
;W[dg];B[bf];W[be]
(;B[qd]TR[bf][cf]C[GV: sacrificing the two marged stone B has a nice wall on the top, just later failed to take advantage of it]
;W[ce];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[df];B[if];W[hf];B[rd];W[bd];B[sd]
;W[qc];B[kg]
(;W[ie];B[jh]TR[ph][gp][fq][gq][nq]C[GV: B should not worry, the K10 stone is a good protection against cutting. B put lot of stones into building the wall, so should not waste them. I'm not fond of long walls, but once there are build, they can be used as a good base for teritory]
(;W[rc];B[nd];W[mb];B[ji]C[GV: B has many such useless moves. This is not an offense, before every move you should ask what you will gain with the move? is there anything bigger? The wall is SO STRONG, so this move seems to me really a waste. 

Maybe try to learn (both W and B) more about sabaki - light moves. http://senseis.xmp.net/?Sabaki   generaly - you put stones more from each other to gain more territory or influence and you loose few stones, it won't hurt so much]
(;W[po]TR[op][qp][nq]SQ[oh][ph][qh][rh][ni][hn][gp]C[GV: W corretly chose the weakest stone to attack . But as said before, attaching when attacking is mostly not a good idea, as B will / should imediatelly make the stone or group stronger 

This is W's clear attak.  B should not ignore it and play in the attacked area. Q4 has still plenty of place to live by itself, no need to connect. A following successulf attempt to connect the Q4 stone cost B opportunity to build reasonable territory against his walls.]

;B[so];W[sn];B[sm]TR[rn][gp]SQ[jl][jm][kn][jo][jp]C[GV: there is a white group floating in the middle, so far withou eye, but with plenty of space around, so I feel B and W should do something about. On this game it is often seen that B's best moves are as well W's best moves.]

C[GV: againt - to attack a group - B doesn't need to attack directly by attaching (touching an opponent's stone), taking space around will be good enough.

The rest is more or less the endgame .

I'l try to summarize main points:

- first try to build some  influence (if not territory) and then reduce opponent's. It is often seen in higher rank games to attack from the beginning, but one must have a good feeling where and when to stop. Attacking from the beginning cost B it's handicap advantage.

- it is hard to learn when stop to fight for few points and tenuki 
(play elsewhere) to get for more points. This seems to be the main reason why W won the game. Had better feeling for big(ger) points.

- related to the first point - if you build a heavy wall, try to take advantage of it using it as a base of your territory, so play away from the wall - where you want to have another territory border. Usually a good places are balance points between W and B stones.

- when attacking (and often defending), do not touch the opponent's stone. It forces opponent to immediately fortify the attacked stone or group and make it stronger.

- think abount meaning of the stone before you put it down? is it attacking, defending. connecting, , building a moyo ot territory? 

Generaly it was a nice game with lot of fights - from beginning to the end and I like the spirit  :)   Just don't forget, the game is won by territory, not fighting.]
