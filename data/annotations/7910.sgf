RE[W+39.5]

C[Hello, thanks for reviewing!  A few questions throughout it, they are a bit scarce, any comments anywhere are more then welcome

-------------
Reviewed by Reflame (Pavel Jelínek, Prague, Czech Republic, pjel@centrum.cz)

I am very approximately 10 kyu on KGS and 14 kyu in Europe. Unfortunately, some of my comments may be false (when I say that Black cannot escape etc.), because I simply overlooked the move which can punish the opponent. A prominent example is my comment to move 93. 

--------------

My advice that B should connect at H9 was WRONG because Q9 group is dead. It would take me some time to find all places where I mentioned this advice.

I hope that my comment will still be useful, because I can read a bit further than the players who played this game. Feel free to email me if my comments are not clear.

----------------------

I think that black lost because he missed many wonderful opportunites to invade top left and bottom left corner. Look carefully at your move 225, this one illustrates it very clearly.

Black also allowed W to make a dangerous framework during moves 21-26. See my comments there. 

Black has also made a mistake in move 245+253 with fatal consequences]

;B[gg]C[Reflame: I think move 11 is a violation of the proverb "There Is No Territory In The Center" (see http://senseis.xmp.net/?ThereIsNoTerritoryInTheCenter). I believe this applies not only to endgame (as the page says).

It is far easier to surround territory near the edges, so one should play elsewhere only after the edges are occupied.]
;W[ff];B[gf]C[Right time to start fighting?

Reflame: No, there is much spoil (I mean territory) to divide near the edges. I would play O17 (or N3)]
;W[fe];B[fg]LB[ge:A]C[Reflame: Move 15 allows White to play at A and Black is left with cutting points. If you decided to fight here, I would prefer A.]
;W[ge];B[he];W[hd]C[Ryter [?\]: Lols. Yeah, that'd be nice.]
;B[if]
(;W[np]C[Reflame: Black is lucky because W should play J15 and then J16. The bl.stone at G16 is so weak that (I believe) W would stay connected and would have a formidable position.]
;B[qo]LB[on:A][pn:B][qn:C]C[Reflame: Move R5 brings tool little. I would play A B or C. 

Please look carefully (!!) at page http://senseis.xmp.net/?44PointHighApproach  
This page clearly says that B is the best play. 

Sometimes the best play in your game can be different from what you find in the corresponding joseki - that happens if other stones are nearby. 

Here you want to deny White the forming giant framework (see my comment to move 26). I would play K10 or around H9. Or I would do after playing Q6....

--------------------------------

Btw. look at the final position. Black lost many points because he tried in vain to invade corner C17. Now (or in the following turns) is a perfect time invade (if you don't have anything more urgent), because the invasion is still possible, but the advantage of the resulting white wall will be much smaller than if the area around G15 was (almost) empty.]
;W[on];B[qm]C[Reflame: A useless move in a critical situation. Now it is very important to use the opportunity, that W's move does not require an immediate reaction.

Now when Black does not have to respond, he must take the initiative and play to some of the pressing places where the outcome will drastically depend on who plays there first. These are C17, J16, enclosing the top right (the safest way is P17), but most at all, to play somewhere near H9!!

It is extremely important to take the initiative whenever the opponent allows it (see http://senseis.xmp.net/?sente)]
;W[ok];B[oc];W[oh]C[Zebarsin, please look at this position very carefully:

I am not certain, how to compare the territory you secured by P17 with a bigger, but only potentional territory, which you could deny to white if you played somewhere near H9 instead. 

If the later weighs more, then maybe last few turns were where you lost the game.
Your move at R5 gave you some territory, but meanwhile White created a giant framework (thas means: potential territory, http://senseis.xmp.net/?Framework) between C10-P12-O4-D4.

There is a proverb "There Is No Territory In The Center" (http://senseis.xmp.net/?ThereIsNoTerritoryInTheCenter), but this (in my opinion) simply says that it is rather easy to reduce every oponent't territory in the center to minimum. But beginners like you and me can overlook the oportunities to do so. 

Notice that if, at some point, you play at G4, then you will have a group without base (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Base); White will chase (senseis.xmp.net/?Chasing) it and during this chase, he will make a wall towards the edge, so territory D2 to K2 will belong to him, and almost certainly the corner.

On the other hand, if you play at C3, then you will create a small territory, but white will make a giant wall facing outwards, which will make any attempt to reduce his framework ( C10-P12-O4-D4) extremely difficult, because the wall will give White a huge advantage when trying to capture your groups (see http://senseis.xmp.net/?Influence).

Btw. It is extremely important to choose the right time for invasions!! To do it when invasion is still possible, but when the game has advanced so much that the resulting wall will bring little use

------------------------------------------

I write this to illustrate, that it is very unfortunate that White has already created such framework. Now it is hard to reduce his advantage; in the next game, you should prevent it.]
;B[qh]LB[pg:A]C[Reflame: Very little, see previous turns' comments for alternatives]
;W[og];B[kg]LB[oq:A][id:C]C[So far so good?  Any better moves?

Reflame: Please answer to yourself, what you want to achieve. Secure territory? Gain influence? Weaken the opponent¨s group? Strenghten yours? 

It seems to me that your move gains none of those things.

I might play A to secure your corner - it is important to understand that during the game, the disadvantages of invasion decrease and the advantage increases, so after some time, the possible invasion becomes advantageous. One of the reasons why White did not perform an invasion at R3 earlier is that Black would form a formidable wall and therefore a great influcence. W would lose more (Black's influence) than he gained (territory). But now this no longer applies and so Black should prevent the invasion.

See also http://senseis.xmp.net/?InvadingAnEnclosure

J16 is also not bad because W constantly ignores a possible mighty move "White J15"

But the large W framework is frightening and must be dealt with (my, not too skillful, answer HOW to deal with it, would be around H9)]
;W[jj]C[Ryter [?\]: Sounds good.];B[gj]C[Reflame: If this move was played BEFORE K10, it would be harder for W to block the penetration]
;W[gk];B[om]LB[hk:A][dm:B][gp:C]C[Reflame: Perhaps the page http://senseis.xmp.net/?DontAttachWhenAttacking might be relevant for this situation.

Black's priority is to prevent White from enclosing the huge territory between C10-P9-O4-D4.

I would play A (or B or C), but there may be better moves.]
;W[nm];B[oo];W[pm];B[ol];W[pl];B[nl]C[I knew I was in a ladder, but figured i had breakers up top so I went with it.

Reflame: Q11 is safe and it captures White (look at the variant).

It is OK to choose the safer variant if you really cannot count (I mean: predict if the seemingly risky one ends in your favour) - but it is VERY important to practise this ability. And to solve www.goproblems.com]

(;B[jm]C[My goal right here is to maybe see if I can kill the group on the right.

Reflame: Please look at the rich tree of variants which I created. Although the resulting fight is too hard for me to calculate flawlessly (so it is theoretically possible that I suggest a move because I overlooked that the oponnent can punish it), it can still give you insights how to use a sequence of ataris or forced moves to gain something. 

It can also be useful to compare some of the resulting positions with what followed in your game.]
;W[jl];B[kl];W[il];B[km];W[mm];B[ln]LB[jo:A][in:B][lq:C]C[Reflame: I would play A or B to expand, or C to harrash W group around P7]
;W[no];B[lp]C[Reflame: Very good];W[op];B[po];W[jo]C[Ryter [?\]: XD I like it.

Reflame: If I read correctly, then White just made a HUGE mistake. Black should have punished him by N3, see the variant]
(;B[hj]C[Reflame: Why here? 
Black can play D13 and later C17
Black should also be very careful to do something about the great potential territory of White between C10-G9-K3 !!!!!!

But what?  Perhaps D7 with later C3 (Invasion at C3 will let W build a big wall, so this invasion MUST be postponed to the time, when this wall will not bring too much use, invading now would be too soon).

Of course, playing D7 or G4 would create weak groups which W would chase (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Chasing). It is a hard riddle for me, I lost several games because I could not correctly decide in THIS kind of situation.]
(;W[lg]C[Reflame: White made a terrible mistake. I think that his P12 groups is doomed (black had an opportunity to kill it by playing P15 in move 101. 

It is a question if W could save it by a different play in move 92. My best idea is to play at N13 in move 92.]
;B[lh]C[Reflame: Before I noticed that P12 groups has nowhere to escape, I wrote that "Black M12 is a big mistake and White correctly punished it.".

Now I see that the contrary is true. This black move is good and results in capturing white if both players play correctly.

So I am afraid I may have done more such mistakes. I believe that my analysis will still be useful, because I can read several moves further than you, but as you can see, I also make many mistakes.]

Reflame: I would consider connecting at H9 (the question is WHEN: If B does it in move 51, W can connect at N2). When L8 group is connected with G13 group, it is safe and W's only chance is to create eyes]
;W[qc]C[Trying to take the stones, I almost missed it.];B[od]

;W[ob];B[nb]C[Reflame: You were safe. You should play a big move elsewhere. C17 is not bad, but even better is H9 or P3. I prefer P3 because B group has more room to escape then W (and would probably win the capturing race).]

If B plays there first, the group lives, because black plays T2 and then either O1 or S1.

Now the benefit of invasion "Black C3" already outweights the loss (the big wall).
The same has been true about "Black C17" for many moves; you played many smaller moves instead.

And if you want to reduce territory near D13, then D13 would be better (see variant and: senseis.xmp.net/?CuttingTheOnePointJump)]

(;B[hh]C[He didn't connect, which shocked me.

Reflame:t if W he does not connect, then black D7 lets B create a formidable position, a powerful starting point for invasions.

And notice that whether he connects or not, he will still lose 2 stones: F10 and E11

In move 221, B can play F11 and have a nice result, see variant]
;W[mo];B[fi]C[Thought I've give up the 4 at the bottom in exchange for the 4 up top, gives room to really expand I think

Reflame: Yes. You have a correct way of thinking. The important thing is that you connected your groups]
;W[lo];B[kn]C[Reflame: You save one stone (this gives you at most 2 points, but actually less). Look how many points you could grab by any of these: C17   C3     C13

This is a very illustrative situation: you should constantly look at the whole board and analyze whether there is a more powerful move than responding locally to your opponent. (And I know how hard it is to learn this, but it is important).

On the other hand, W has been making a big mistake as well: he has played many smaller moves instead of securing both TL and BL corner. You should punish his mistake if he did not punish yours!

Reflame: Sorry, it is too difficult for me to calculate exactly when B group is alive.
But B should try to calculate it and at the first sign of trouble (that means: whenever black is not sure that he lives after W cut at D13), he should connect at D1.

The move 241 B E17 preserves one eye, but W can aggressively reduce his eyespace by responding A18 (that is called:  http://senseis.xmp.net/?MonkeyJump). See the variant; I think that B still lives. 

If B decides that preventing the Monkey Jump is more important, he can play his 241. move at B16. I tried several variants, they almost look as if they lead to seki (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Seki), which is favourable for B. But if I did not miss something, W is able to kill B before he forms a seki.

That would mean that you have done the best possible thing.]

Reflame: Yes, if you you have more ko-threats than W (so big that they will not be ignored), then you should C16 again and again and when W runs out of big threats (and very few threats can be bigger than deciding the fate of your D17 group), then you should ignore the threats and play C19.

If you cannot see who has more threats, simply go for it because here you have nothing to lose.

Ko-fighting (http://senseis.xmp.net/?KoFighting) is a very thrilling and very challenging part of the game of go; it is a big fun but it is often very hard to fing the best move.

I think W made a mistake, when he allowed his C18 group be "captured via ko". B group would then live]

The H6-N6 group does not have a base (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Base) and so White can chase it (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Chasing), but on the other hand, this black group can expand by chasing the N8 group. 

The HUGE space between C10 and N5 seemed as White's potential territory a few (tens of) turns ago, now the black group can fill it. 

I don't know]))
