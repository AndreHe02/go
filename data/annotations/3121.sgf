C[Llywelyn: I am going to prefix my comments with "Llywelyn."  

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask: ap_llywelyn@mac.com

There is one main thing you need to work on that I can see.

Making stronger connections and shapes in fighting.  There are several times where you make a tigers mouth or knights move when you should be making a solid connection or a one space jump.   A tigers mouth is good for a lot of things--its a very powerful shape--but it isn't necessarily better than a solid connection, especially when there are a lot of enemy stones around you.

You also have a tendency to leave your groups weak and then move on.  There's an expression to "never have two weak groups at once," this is good advice.

Hopefully this helps.  A stronger player would probably have clearer vision on this, but I hope you find this valuable.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cf]TR[ec]LB[qe:A]C[Llywelyn: It takes two moves to secure the corner on the 4-4 point, so there's generally no rush to do so.  Its better to approach unbalanced corners first (A), since the 4-4 point is very territory oriented.]
;W[fc];B[hc]TR[db][dc]C[Llywelyn: Either of the marked moves would have secured the corner. You would let white form a base on the north side, but that's not really a problem.]
;W[db]C[I felt this invasion could be stopped but was unsure how to do so.

Llywelyn: This is an odd move for white--its very small.  The short answer is: you may or may not be able to stop it, but its small enough and early enough in the game that you might want to let white take some territory and just gain a lot of influence for the trouble.]
;B[lc]LB[kc:C][qe:A][cc:B]C[Llywelyn: If you wanted a free play, A would have been best--it would have secured that corner for you.  If you wanted to punish white for trying to crawl in there like that, B would have cut white's base.  If you had wanted to secure your lone black stone, the two space jump at C would have done that well.

Personally, I would have either enclosed the corner, but a stronger player might have a better idea.]
;W[qe];B[qg];W[qc];B[qb];W[pd]C[I think I should have played S17 here to ward off this invastion better]

(;B[qj]TR[oc][pb]LB[oc:A]C[Llywelyn: Your stones are not secure.  Currently a white movie at the triangle (or at A) would solidify white's position and cut away your sphere of influence very quickly.  A move at A would help protect that cut and secure your shape (see variation).]
;W[oc];B[pb];W[ob];B[rc];W[qd];B[rd];W[re]C[T18 here probably could have made life?

Llywelyn: Doesn't look like it, white could play S19  and make things miserable.]
;B[oa];W[na];B[pa];W[rb];B[qm];W[qn];B[cq]TR[fq][cn]C[Llywelyn: WAY too early for this invasion, especially on this side.  You take very little territory and give white good thickness with this move.  One of the knights-move approaches would be best.]
;W[dq];B[cp]
(;W[hq]C[Llywelyn: Weird move on White's part--a bit greedy.]

(;B[dr]TR[do]C[Llywelyn: A connection on the other side would have been bigger and stronger.]
;W[er];B[br]SQ[cr]C[Llywelyn: The solid connection is best here.]
;W[ds];B[cr];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[eo]SQ[cm]C[Llywelyn: White should have pushed harder with a solid connection and prevented you from getting the hane.]
;B[cm];W[cc];B[cd];W[pq]C[Llywelyn: Odd move.];B[bc]TR[hc][lc]
C[Llywelyn: Really small.  A move along the south side--either an invasion or a reduction, would be a better choice.  The marked group also needs to be reinforced.]
;W[bb]C[By this point I felt the game was lost already because I had lost 3 corners.

Llywelyn: The expression is if you lose four corners ~_^

This game can still be won--there's lots of points to be had and you can reduce the number of points of territory that white can get.]
;B[dc]LB[fd:B][ed:A]C[Llywelyn: Other side at A or possibly B would give you better shape and upward facing influence.]
;W[cb];B[be]TR[ho][pn][fn][ip]C[Llywelyn: too cautious and small.  You need to be playing aggressively to reduce the damage or securing your groups to give you a better shot.]
;W[ec];B[ci];W[bl];B[bm];W[bj];B[ck]SQ[cj][bi]C[Llywelyn: You are just tempting fate here.]

;W[bf];B[df];W[dh];B[ef];W[eh]C[Thought about playing F12 here to confine the white group at E12 but decided against it.

Llywelyn:   E12 was a really powerful move, doing something in that area for damage control would have been good.]
;B[of];W[pm];B[pl];W[rm];B[ql];W[om];B[ol];W[gh]C[Thought about F12 again but thought I could make more territority by extending the row on the right side of row 8]
;B[ml]C[Llywelyn: F12 would have been a quick way into a losing a fight.]
;W[mn];B[kl]TR[km]C[Llywelyn: One lower would have put more pressure on white. 

Think of this as a race to get ahead--you need to try and cut your opponent off and keep them from getting ahead of you.]
;W[eg];B[de]TR[ge][hc][fe]LB[ff:A]C[Llywelyn:  Small.  Overly defensive for this stage of the game.  Connecting at A would have solidified your eyespace and still left you the ability to connect to your base on the northern part of the field.]
;W[gg];B[fg]C[Llywelyn: A solid connection would have been best.]
;W[fh];B[ff];W[ah];B[aj];W[af];B[ak];W[ai];B[kq]TR[hq][pq][pp]
C[This invasion on my part was a bi desperate - I knew with the white group on the left alive and etendign into the middle i needed another foothold.

Llywelyn: You would have been far better off reducing.   Running in this invasion also seems optimal, rather than trying to fight for life on the third line with white's groups pressing.]
;W[mq];B[jo]C[Llywelyn: A knight's move here was not the best choice--too easy to break.  Perhaps a two space jump?]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[ko];B[kn];W[lo];B[jm];W[jq];B[ho]C[Llywelyn: despite that you failed in an invasion you actually had a pretty good reduction.]
;W[hf];B[fn]TR[hf]C[Llywelyn: As pressing a concern as reducing along the southwest is, you need to have your eye on the north--White's play shows a clear intention to move in.]
;W[en];B[em];W[fo];B[gn];W[hp];B[gj];W[fj]C[White F10 bothered me - I didn't know the best way to keep it from growing down.]
;B[fk];W[ej];B[ek]C[Llywelyn: That seemed to work well.];W[io]
;B[in];W[ip];B[jn];W[jc]C[I thought a long time about playing K15 here to keep H17 and M17 connected, but ultimately thought inside was safer.]

[qc][qe]C[These fist line invasion always fluster me.

Llywelyn: This is called a monkey jump and is a fairly common endgame move when white has a solid position on the second line.]
;B[sg];W[rg];B[rh];W[sf];B[si];W[sg];B[qi];W[qf];B[pf]C[Llywelyn: Seemed to work okay.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[rn];B[jj];W[ki];B[kh]C[I realized this was a mistake right after playing it.  I think I should have played L10 or even N10.

Llywelyn: L10.];W[kg];B[jh];W[ih];B[ii];W[jg];B[hi]C[Llywelyn: L10 is calling to you.]

;W[gc];B[ga];W[fa];B[ha];W[eb];B[eq]C[It seemed to me white's wall on lower left wasn't stable and I tired to cut with E3 but it didn't work out.  The wall still seems weak to me but I can't see a better move.

Llywelyn: White's structure here isn't expecially weak.  C1 is an okay move because its sente and keeps sente, but there are more pressing matters out there.]

SQ[lr]C[It seemed to me that I could make life on the bottom right still.

Llywelyn: Not likely.  A stronger player might see something I'm not, but it looks like you need to produce an eye in your southeast group and another one on the other side of the barrier.    You are depending on white to make a mistake, which is never a good operating policy.]
