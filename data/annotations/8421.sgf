C[hmm lots of dead groups but after the dust settles 3.5 point loss

GP: Hi, I'm Graham Lamburn (johndoe69 on KGS), currently between KGS 1d and 2d. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can (marked with GL:) and have tried to answer your questions and comments, and I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf. Where I'm offering or annotating variations that deviate from the game, I mark the game move with a square and the deviation with a triangle (including your variations if you provided them and I commented on them). If I'm simply offering alternative moves as a comment, I normally mark each with a triangle, and most variations have a comment at the end.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[eq]C[not sure which one is better

GL: R5 is more common, particularly if C4 is at D4, as it makes the overall position along the bottom higher. However, with C4, this no longer applies so much, as White can immediately approach at E4 or F3 and make it hard to develop the bottom. I would still prefer R5, as Q16 makes the Q5 approach ideal for White.]
;W[po]TR[qm][np]SQ[qo]
(;B[qo]C[GL: Generally not the best choice when White has a stone at Q16, as you give him the ability to create a moyo on a large scale (the normal joseki finishes with R10, but White can play Q10 here to make the most of the high position of Q16). You can consider pincering, or O4 is fine to take territory in sente.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[nq];W[qi]C[GL: White can play high here.]
;B[cf];W[fd]TR[dj]SQ[bd]
(;B[bd]TR[ch]SQ[cc]C[*** Important Point ***

GL: You are playing very flat, with a combination of 2nd and 3rd line stones. You've made the shimari in the lower left, so your stones really want to develop the left side in as big a way as possible. White can opt to hit C12 now and restrict Black's development whilst continuing to build on a larger scale. I'd rather play this at D10.

It's very useful to get into the habit of developing fuseki ideas that have a balance between 3rd and 4th line stones. Yilun Yang covers this subject well in "Fundamental Principles of Go".]
(;W[cc]TR[di]SQ[ef]
(;B[ef]C[GL: This is a mistake, as White can too easily take away the left hand side as he can invade with enough space to make a base. Better to play this at D11.]
;W[ck];B[ci]C[GL: This is the correct side to play, but somewhat painful, as the shimari has lost its impact on the game once White makes a base.]
;W[cn];B[nc]C[GL: Good.];W[nd];B[md];W[ne]TR[oc][pc][qc]SQ[me]
(;B[me]C[*** Important Points ***

GL: This must be P17 - it's such a vital shape point for both players that allowing White to take it fixes his entire corner in sente. You can also consider Q17 to make a more solid position (albeit making White thicker in the process, so possibly unwise here because White can develop the right hand side nicely), or even R17, trading the top stones for the coner. Because White has 4th line stones at F16 and can look to develop, I would suggest that the best course of action for Black is to make sure he can get a good foothold up there, which means of the three main choices (P17, Q17 and R17), I'd pick P17 - I've included the three so you can see how the normal end of each sequence looks.

Allowing White to get P17 without being able to trade O17 for the corner is so very painful, it's a very important joseki/opening point to take home from this game.]
;W[oc];B[hc]C[I sorta planned this

GL: It's a good, big point, but the top right group is a bit more urgent. You've left the stones in a very thin position, and you've reinforced the corner substantially. You'd be better playing this point before the O17 approach if you want to build this sort of attack - it's definitely the key point, and a fun idea, but you've taken too much of a loss with the top right stones to start the attack now.]

(;B[bm]TR[mf]SQ[cm]C[is the shoulder hit better? (to keep white low)

*** Important Point 1 ***

GL: Yes, I think it's fairly definitively better. You've managed to create a pretty thick position from the top, and you really want to lean over these two stones to expand it further. Using thickness effectively is always urgent, as it can be made redundant surprisingly quickly. The purpose of a thick position is to quickly build a large moyo, ideally in sente, where it is very hard for the opponent to reduce. Having a weak group you can seal in in sente is a thick player's dream :)

*** Important Point 2 ***

GL: However, more urgently than this is to prevent White from getting the hane at N14, which is really huge due to the weaknesses in shape Black has. I've included a tenuki continuation for White here, as well as an alternative variation for Black at D7 instead of B7.]

C[*** Summary ***

In this game, you had a slightly unfavourable opening due to picking a number of sequences that left you low on the 3rd line. It's worth browsing a few joseki sequences that give you alternatives that allow you to mix and match a more balanced opening. Particularly with a shimari or 4-4 style opening, you want to develop adjacent sides with some scope and pace. The left hand side was a good example of ending up with a very inefficient shimari, despite having the opportunity to make considerably more with it.

Despite that, you pulled off a good sequence on the top edge and had the potential to use White's weaknesses to develop nicely in the center, but instead chased White out, making it hard to make the best use of the result at the top.

You played some great fighting sequences in this game :)

*** Important Points ***

15 - Balanced opening combining influence and territory, with a mix of 3rd and 4th line stones.
25 - Critical joseki shape habit to remember.
43 - Using thickness is urgent - being able to make further thickness to supplement it in sente is an opportunity never to be missed.
43 - Hane at head and foot of two stones is so painful, extending to avoid it is urgent.

After this point, I've included a number of variations for thought, but a lot of it was tactical infighting, so hard to make general principles from :)

*** Recommendations ***

Depending on which areas you'd like to work on, I'd recommend the kakari high approach joseki book by Yilun Yang for some interesting ideas in the opening; I'd recommend his Fundamental Principles of Go book as well for discussions of appropriate stone placement, pincer choices, and the balance of high and low stones. I'd also recommend Ishida Yoshio's "All about Thickness" book with how to make the best use of an influential position. All have good material and seem to be relevant to the recommendations from this game.

You can also have a browse around www.josekipedia.com and www.brugo.be for joseki ideas (both are more reliable than Kogo's dictionary), but these obviously won't explain why a choice is better than another one.

I hope these comments are in some way helpful. If you have any responses / queries / comments or would like further input on specific moves or areas, do feel free to ask!]
