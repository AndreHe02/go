\\m/ : you can extend one more further, this is ok too.];B[ep]

(;W[eq]C[W : not sure of this, but couldn't see a good alternative]
;B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[bn];B[jq]C[\\m/ : really good for b, your pincer has no meaning now]
;W[qi]C[W : quiet looking but it feels important to forestall black R10.

\\m/ : This is good];B[bm]
(;W[cm]C[W : I suppose I can draaw back, thentake C13, but i was concerned to limit black's moyo development.  Wrong?

(;W[lp]C[\\m/ : too deep];B[nn];W[oq];B[op]C[W  : both players were looking eagerly at Q4 next.  Black thought it wasn't as urgent as plays outside.  White wanted to reserve the option of  atari underneath.]
