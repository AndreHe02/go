(;B[re]C[janr: the joseki in the game looks slow for black.  How about the variation?]
;W[kc]C[I chose this joseki to try to get o 15 in sente later and create a moyo on the right]
;B[cd]C[janr: if black makes a low position in the upper left, it may be hard to let the taisha-ponnuki and the thickness in the upper right work together.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[dg];B[df];W[ef];B[cf];W[eg];B[dc];W[eb]C[Usually here joseki ends with c13, but I am afraid of W o14.]
;B[ne];W[md];B[lf]LB[pf:C][cg:A][qo:B]C[So I try to get my wished result.

janr: yes, but the white block at A is a big sente move, and the influence C is very far from the low stone B.  So I think blacks influence is not worth the ommission of the joseki move on the left.]
;W[pk]C[Now W invades the moyo, I can't find a good answer.



I was considering q11, cap at o9 or tenuki.


janr: it is hard to attack white directly.
How about finishing the joseki on the left and see whether white will spend more moves in the center which don't make points?


I probably made a mistake here.];B[kq];W[qh]C[W settles himself and now I am not sure about what to do.

janr: finish the upper left joseki or reduce white's upper territory?]
;B[ph]C[j√©n(: is there a reason to attach to white's slightly weak stones?]
;W[qg]C[janr: it would prefer a white hane.];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj]
LB[rk:A]C[janr: I don't like this last push.
maybe later black will get a chance to attack white's base 
at A?];W[qk]C[I tried to gain strenght and reduce to compensate on top]
;B[nd];W[nc]LB[nj:A][ok:B]C[janr: pushing doesn't seem urgent for black. Locally, making shape (e.g. A or B) seems better to me.]
;B[me];W[pg]C[W cuts, it hurts but I feel I can accept this.]
;B[ld];W[mc];B[lc];W[lb];B[kd]C[janr: it feels like pushing from behind.  
 I think black doesn't reduce strongly in this way but does lose liberties while strengthening white]
;W[jc];B[og];W[ni]C[Now W aims at the cut.



Looking at the board I feel the urgency of c12 to complete joseki and to don't live small in the corner.]
;B[ch];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[ng]LB[jd:A][qd:C][ne:B]C[janr: now that black has sacrificed three stones, why not tenuki again?  The push at A seems sente to me.
If black does not connect here I don't think white can cut B from C easily.]
;W[mi]C[Time to tenuki again, I feel that the biggest one is b6, but maybe there are better options that I can't see.]
;B[bn];W[di];B[ci];W[dj]LB[dh:B][eh:C][ei:D][bn:A]C[Scared again of the chance of a W moyo on top, I play there thinking that the timing is good.

janr: black invested a move at A which is only valuable if black makes territory on the left.  So blacks strategy is not really consistent if he tenukis now.  How about answering the push, or cutting at B (white C black D) (the ladder working well for black) ?]
;B[jd];W[id]C[Now a strange and dangeous fight.

 I hope you can explain the right way to do things here.]
(;B[ie]C[
janr: I think it is better for black to first create aji in white's position.  In fact, black is quite solid and white has some thinness it seems. How about the variation?]
;W[he];B[hf]C[Mybe my double hane is too ambitious, but there is little time left, almost byo-yomi, so I can't read everything.

janr: if White just defends and finishes his territory, how will black use his thickness?  White is also rather solid on the right side.  I think black is insufficiently ambitious by only pushing and not trying to aim at a cut.]
;W[je];B[if];W[kf]C[janr: white is overly ambitious.  if black captures a stone, white's territory will suffer and black will be hard to kill.]
;B[le];W[kg]C[Now it is really confusing.];B[kb];W[jb];B[hd]
;W[ic]
(;B[lh]C[I accept the fight, maybe better to g15 and then escape?

janr: capturing at g15 would be big and sente I think.  If white doesn't answer he gets severely cut.  I believe also that black can live on the right.  See variation.]
;W[kh];B[ge]C[Now I do it, trying to connect or live easily.]
;W[fd];B[ii];W[mh]
(;B[li]C[janr: I think it is better for black to stay connected]
;W[ji]C[This move is really hard to deal with.

janr: yes, because black is not connected on the right.];B[lg]

I think it is an interesting game, thanks again for reviewing!


janr: I think in the beginning black tried to hard to get influenceand white was ahead.  Then, when the game was promising for white he made a number of unnecessary/easy to avoid mistakes and black could catch up.]
