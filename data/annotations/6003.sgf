AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[[krinid\] This is a game that I won, but feel I shouldn't have.  I was outplayed but was just fortunate due to a few mistakes on white's part.  Looking over the game, I'm interested first and foremost in how my global strategy failed (because it was only white's mistakes that let me win).

Points I'm interested in having reviewed:
- how my global strategy failed (because it was only white's mistakes that let me win)
- how I could have played better to keep my bottom side groups connected
- how I could have played better/offensively (I was also on the defensive most of the game)
- a few specific questions in the game asked in comments on move numbers: 34, 58, 88
- any specific comments on my fuseki and yose

BLACK - krinid, 5k on KGS
WHITE - a 1k opponent on KGS

[Y\] Hi, I'm Yan.  I will do my best to review your game.  I see you have four stone advantage.  Normally my approach is to make safe non-joseki moves and gain advantage when my opponent makes suboptimal plays.  We will how you do in this game.]
;W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[qk];B[kq]C[[Y\] So far so good.  But why not K3?  It links up with D4 nicely hence has more power.  There is an old japanese saying, literally translates as: you would rather play a brave game than weak moves because in the end even if you lose, you lose without losing your go spirit.  That's why you see often in pro games, if they realize they cannot win, they would make a brave but unreasonable move as their final move.  And if they opponent answers correctly, they resign at that point.  It's quite interesting:-).]

;W[qg];B[mc];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[ch]C[[Y\]  This move is a bit weird.  If you want to build your moyo, you don't want to play on third line.  If you want to get territory, you would connect with either upper left corner or lower left group.  This stone is not connected to either group.  So it's not as good, unless you are a pro:-).   C14 or c10 is better.  I would go with c14.]
;W[cg]C[[Y\] white makes unreasonable move now.];B[dh]C[[Y\] Good.]
;W[dg];B[gc]C[[Y\] E13 is urgent.  Hane at the head of two stones.  You are much stronger here, so you need to be aggressive.  If E13, even if you don't kill the white stones, which is very heavy by the way, your outside would become real territory soon.]
;W[fg]C[[Y\] White is happy to get out.];B[ce]C[[Y\]  Attacking moves doesn't have to be close. I would play C[16\].  Leave no aji at the corner.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[bf];B[ci];W[hc]
(;B[hb]C[[krinid\] I really wanted to play on top at H16 here, see variation.  Also the variation of move 36.  What's the best response here?

[Y\] Considering your corner is not settled, I would play G16.]
;W[fc]
(;B[fb]C[[Y\] Again G18.  F18 is helping white.];W[ec];B[dc]
;W[eb];B[db];W[fa];B[gb];W[fe];B[hd];W[ee];B[qe];W[re]C[[Y\] Black left upper corner is not alive yet..]

;B[de]C[[krinid\] At this point, I judged the top left to be alive.  However, through going through variations after the game, I see that it's only through white's mistakes that this group lives.  At what point did this group die and how could I have played this better to make it live?

[Y\] All because of C15.  And still not alive yet.];W[eh];B[kj]

What's the best response/some better responses to this?

[Y\] Simply n3 is good.  Why fight with a poor man when you are rich.  Another proverb.]

(;B[ho]C[[krinid\] I realized it a little too late that the H3 stone was in jeapardy.  In hindsight, I probably should have just let this die and distinctly killed the N2 group at this point.

[Y\] It doesn't have to die.  White is playing unreasonable here hoping that you would make a mistake. K4 is the right move here.]
;W[kp];B[ko];W[jp];B[jo];W[io]

[es][fs][gs][hs][is][js][ls]C[[krinid\] Thanks for the review.

[Y\].  I think I've answered all your questions during the game.  To recap:

1) your global strategy was too keep the lead, but it didn't work because you didn't make solid connected groups, and failed to be aggressive when white makes unreasonable move.

2) Don't play moves that help your opponent if you don't get equal or more in return.  Think of ways to disrupt your opponent's plan.  Another handy proverb is your opponent's key point is your key point.  Play those first:-).

3) Ko threats are very important.  Many games are won from ko threats, you want to keep those as much as possible.

I enjoyed reviewing the game.  Thank you for submitting the game.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers,
Yan])
