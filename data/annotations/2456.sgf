AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hi, I am playing Black here. I'm about 15k ok KGS, and I'm playing an opponent who is 1d on KGS. I resigned the game, but according to my opponent it was too early to say.
The game has several fights I'm not too sure about.
Thank you.

laver: Hi, my name is Emiliano Bacci. My rank is 5 kyu.

I love to play handicap games as black, since they are a very good training
session for fighting. It will be a pleasure to comment your match!]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[pm]
(;B[qh]C[Black: Since one of the goal of white's move is to put pressure on the center stone, I thought it better to defend it and put the pressure back on the stone that was the most surrounded.

laver: I think this is perfect. Another option would be to reinforce the Q4 hoshi
stone in order to make with subsequent moves a splittiing attack by developing
Q10. Any of the two choices leaves a weak point to be exploited by white. 
In this case, a double approach to the lower right corner cannot be avoided...]
;W[np]C[laver: now black has two objectives
1- survive :)
2- don't let white connect

The second goal is really important to maintain the advantage in
subsequent fights.
Please note that gaining territory is NOT a goal for the moment.
The nine stones give black a great deal of influence, which MUST be used
for fighting, not for securing territory.];B[oo]C[laver: great!]
;W[no];B[lq]C[Black: The idea here was to keep the pressure on the white group by making sure it can't make eyes. Looking at it now, I think maybe playingP6 calmly would have been better.

I definitely agree with you. Remember: keep white separated. If white develops only one group, the other one (Q7 in this case) will be immediately threatened.

Moreover, by playing P6 white achives another strategic keypoint: the black group in the corner is sealed in. This is a great result for white: The Q4 group won't be able to help the other black stones in any fight from now on.
The power of the hoshi stones in Q4 is pretty much annihilated now.]
;W[on];B[nq]C[Black: This looks dubious to me now but I really can't find a better move.  Perhaps O2 ?

laver: Remember the two goals: 
1 survive.
2 don't let white connect.

So, first survive by playing R3, for instance.
Then, aim at O6. But I'm pretty sure that if black R3, White will protect the cut...]
;W[oq]C[Black: This move by white seem to confirm that o3 wasn't a good move, since I can't find a good answer.

laver: I definitely agree. Q4 is in real danger!];B[qn]C[Black: if i can't reconnect, I'll try to get room for eyes.]
;W[qm];B[pq];W[nr];B[mq];W[op];B[pr];W[or];B[po];W[nm]C[laver: OK, black lives in some way, and therefore white immediately hurries up to connect his group. Now it is up to black.
If I were in you, I would have attacked the Q14 stone with P13, for instance.]
;B[rm];W[rl];B[rn];W[qk]C[Black: I guess the result could have been worse, I got the corner and kept the initiative.

laver: this time I disagree with you. Consider the following analysis, referring to the position after move 21 (O7)

- the lower right corner is safe 
- the big white group cannot be attacked: black has not enough power.
- the Q10 group looks now a bit "cramped", since white has a very thick wall in front of it this group needs therefore a reinforced, or by sure it will be sooner or later attacked by White.
- the Q14 stone, by itself very weak, can be "resurrected" by attacking the Q10 group. Black should attack it immediately.

Even if black has sente now, the situation for the Q10 group is worse than before the exchange  (22-25). So now the Q10 gorup cannot make a base on the side. Leaving the side open would have let black (if necessary) to play either S8 or S9 to threat the connection. White S7 for instance, but Black shape would be much better.]
;B[nj]C[Black: this seems a waste of sente. I think I should have plyed something bigger. Though the idea was to prevent white from running everywhere with his new group. Perhaps n10 would have been more effective for that. But perhaps it would been too fragile.

laver: it seems that you felt something similar to my anaysis.
So, the previous exchange, that you consider favourable for black, forced 
black to make a poor move! We must conclude that the exchange was not so favourable for black. Do you agree now?

Anyway, I think P12 or O12 put more pressure on Q14.
Don't be afraid of the big white group in terms of territory. In a 9-stones handicap game, attention should be on power rather than territory.]
;W[lj];B[mi]C[Black: trying to keep the white stone in q14 isolated.

laver: Agree with you. Remember once more:
1- survive
2- keep separated

White M10 is a very strong move, but if you play well, you can turn it into a
bad overplay (white MUST make overplays in handicap games, obviously!)]
;W[ld]C[laver: White is trying to create confusion in your head.
Keep looking at the compass :)

1- survive
2- keep separated.

Therefore, the move is N15.];B[mc]C[Black: I should have played o14 to keep the stone isolated. here I changed my mind (and thus wasting my move in n11)

laver: your analysis is very good to me, but it is a bit late...
But anyway it's good, you learn very quickly! My compliments!

N15 better than O14. N15 also attacks M16. Black M15 after N15 would be unbearable for white, but White M15 makes Black N14 a pleasure...]
;W[nf]C[laver: I am really sorry to bother you, but the concept is always the same.


Keep white groups separated!!!!


So, here I see two choices.

1) Cut at N15 and see what happens. Drawback: you have a weak group to take care of, the one on the right side.
2) Reinforce that weak group (while attacking, e.g. M11) and then, if white
protects the cut, play M17 to secure some territory but MAINLY to attack white on a large scale.

I think the second option is better, due to the weakness on the right.]
;B[kh];W[lf];B[jf]C[Black: trying to keep the whole group isolate, but it takes a lot of stones, and the group can still make eyes on the border.

laver: It seems that you preferred option 2 in my latest comment, that is better with me, too.
BUT you played K14 rather than M17.
By sure your move is the severest, but remeber: your opponent is a first dan, so he will survive by sure.

Anyway, you are very brave! I'm very excited about the imminent fight!
Please remeber that M17 is really huge, anyway: it is worth about 25 secure points AND good chance for White to make eyes.]
;W[qd];B[qc]C[benoit [1d?\]: no pb];W[qe];B[rc]C[laver: black very well here. Now the top is strong.]
;W[lc]C[laver: White is fighting so well... M17 has at least 3 goals:
1- create the weak point at P17
2. destroy black's upper side which was threatening to become too huge
3. Threat the slide at K18 to get room for making eyes and reduce the black framework on the left.]
;B[rg]C[Black: Trying to prevent eye-making now, but this move seems a bit too nice. S14  or r13 would probably have been better (they hurt the eye shape).

laver: At this point white seems alive to me. The only concern is about HOW it will live. I would have tryied to seal white in, forcing him to make eyes on the right side, which is worth very few points now. 
So, K18 is good to me.];W[kg];B[jg];W[rf];B[rj]C[Black: Trying to secure my own eyeshape. I should decide if i'm attacking or defending and no try to do both at the same time. M12 or P16 will later prove critical moves to keep the pressure on.

laver: your feeling is perfect: your group on the side needs a reinforcement.
Actually, the exchange L13-k13 made the cut at M12 work, as we will see in a fow moments.
But your remedy is not the best one. Why to play very poor moves (in terms of points) on the right side, rather than connecting to the outside (e.g. M11 or M12?).]
;W[oc];B[od];W[mb];B[nb];W[nc];B[ob]C[Black: Better to save the corner than the stone. I'm glad that for once I saw it happening.

laver: good, black can't do anything better, I guess.];W[md]
;B[pc]C[laver: this move is not necessary. Black loses sente.]
;W[lh]
(;B[ki]C[laver: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Keep white groups SEPARATED!

The position CLAIMS M11!

Aaargh!

Are you convinced ? Look at the variation!];W[li];B[og]C[laver: From a strategical perspective, this is a great success for white. Here are the reasons:

- White is NOT sealed in, as Black was hoping for when playing K14.
- Black is sealed in, and now he has to struggle for life! The following moves will be painful for black

Now you see why S10 was a very big mistake.
If S10 would have been sufficient for making eyes, then it would have been playable.
But playing S10 instead of connecting at M11-M12, and then being forced to struggle for life is not a good idea!]

;W[oh];B[pj];W[ok];B[og];W[fp]C[laver: black lives in gote making 3 points, and now white can switch to the left.]

(;B[oh]C[Black: Did i need to secure the shape here?

laver: once again, your feeling is correct. If white wins the ko, black has only one eye. But your solution is not the best one. why not to try to escape in M9, destroying white's potential territory? Moreover, in this way you keep white groups separated (the group at the top is therefore enforced to make eyes... those will be painful moves for white).


Moreover, in this particular case, no move is necessary due to the white weakness at N13 (see variations). In other words, black loses sente for nothing...]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[iq];B[er]C[Black: Strange Move? I wanted to protect the corner, but I think E2 isn't the best move for that

laver: The corner is not in danger. Black can either escape to the center or establish a base in the corner. The weak group is the one at the bottom. It does not have a base, so it must flee in the center.]
;W[ip];B[kn]C[Black: trying to escape, but it's probably too late already.

laver: I think it is difficult to escape, but not impossible. K6 is better shape.]
;W[jk];B[im]C[Black: trying to run too fast. This is fragile. l7 or j6 work better.

laver. Agree. J6 is good shape.
Cutting at M9 is not bad, anyway. Black would threat to connect the weak group to N10 or to swallow the K9 stone.]
;W[jo]
(;B[kp]C[laver: this is wrong. to me. L5 is the correct response.
But don't be afraid too much about this error. Remember the strength
of your opponent... Anyway, look at the variations here.];W[hn]
;B[hm];W[jn]C[Black: Ok the stones are cut, I should play elsewhere already.]

(;B[cp]C[Black: since there's no hope for my other stones, back to protecting the corner.

laver. It's not too late, thanks to the aji in O6. Look at the variation.]
;W[mn]C[laver: this is why white makes this move which may appear strange...]
;B[em];W[dl];B[cj]C[laver: E8 better.];W[bo];B[bp];W[el];B[bl]
C[laver: not the best idea. It's better to seal in a small group with just two eyes than to try to kill it at any cost. Moreover, in this case white B8 makes only one aye, so from a strategic point of view, black b8 is useless.]
;W[fm];B[fn];W[dm];B[en];W[jm];B[fj]C[laver: very good indeed :)]
;W[gk];B[hi]C[laver: why not G10?];W[ik];B[gm];W[fl];B[gn];W[ei]
;B[ej]C[laver: White has to begin a desperate fight in the upper left area.

Without considering the upper left, the score is more or less as follows:

BLACK:
- lower left: 10 points
- lower right: 13 points
- right: 3 points
- upper right: 8 points

WHITE:
- upper right: 3 points
- center: 35 points

so, the result is:
black 34, white 37. 

Therefore, the result is almost even. So, if black does better than white in
the upper left, he will win. The situation is favourable to black, since he is 
very strong in this area :) 
It seems that you are going to win !];W[gj];B[gi];W[fd];B[cf]
C[laver: D14 better. Ishida Yoshio 9p says "it's the only response"]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[cb]C[laver: good :)];W[ie];B[je];W[ef]

(;B[ch]C[laver: F11 better here. See variation.];W[fi];B[hg]

;B[hf];W[ge];B[hj];W[hk];B[ij];W[dg];B[cg];W[gh];B[ih]C[Black: here I'm not sure if white is trying to live or trying to kill me, that's why my moves are a bit erratic

laver: agree. White is in a desperate fight. He tries to take advantage of any error you make to either kill you or survive. You played quite well, so you survived and white made very few points. You won by about 20 points!]
;W[de];B[ce];W[ed];B[cd];W[fg];B[gr]C[Black: now that the situation seems more or less stable, back to trying to save my stones.

laver: No, your stones cannot be saved any more. Your habit is typical of newcomers to go. Let's put things in this way:

- at some point you abandoned these stones since you thought they were dead. Ok, in this case they were not, as I shew you through some variation.
But this is not the matter. 
- white then added some further stones to "secure" the dead of those stones. For instance, N6, K6 ang J9.
- so since now the local situation is even worse for black, we should conlcude that those stones are "more" dead than before. 

So, why trying to save them now? Why haven't you tried before? I think emotions influence the decisions of the players, sometime. But a good analysis skill is what one needs to avoid these kind of mistakes.
In this particular case, playing from the outside in order to threat the connection is a good way of reducing white. Playing from the inside is a good way of giving White points for free by adding dead stones and by letting his territory grow.]
;W[hr];B[jr]C[laver: this is what I meant before by "playing from inside"]

;B[db];W[rp]
(;B[qo]C[laver: S5 better shape. See variation];W[rr];B[rq]
;W[sq]C[Black: I resigned here, as I thought my lower-right corner was dead. My opponent later showed me it was actually a seki, But I think i still lost wit the seki.
One thing I'd like to know if there was a way to save my stone in the lower center, and if starting the h3 ko was any use and/or a good idea.
Thanks again.

laver: a few considerations about your resignation:

- even with a seki, not foreseen by you, the result is almost even. 
The remaining part of the yose will decide the winner.
- You have absolute ko threats in D12 and L14, while white has not. Therefore, you could start the all-out ko in R4 rather than playing for the seki. (see variation).

Anyway, I think you played very well. My major suggestion is to think about fighting not only as a tactical matter, byt also keeping in your mind strategic issues:
- sealing in groups
- cutting groups
- depriving groups of a base.

If you want to find out the loosing move, I think it is K2. This allowed white to get the few points to fill the gap between you and him.

Finally, about the ko in h3, white cannot afford black j2, so after k3 it will probably play J2 immediately without fighting the ko.]
