;B[dd]C[Esquire: I thought I was playing well for the first half of the game. Then it all fell apart and he just kept on attacking. I didn't know where to play to stop him. Thanks

MM: I'm Mike Malveaux, AGA 4k, "wegobad" on go servers, doing a Go Teaching Ladder review for White. Let's have a look.]
;W[pd];B[cp];W[pq];B[fq];W[qo];B[ei];W[jq]TR[ei]C[MM: So far, looks good for White, with pretty nice development.  Black's move at E11 looks strange and too high, so either Black will need another move in that area -- inefficient -- or there will be a weakness for White to attack.]
;B[nc];W[lc]TR[nd][qf]C[MM: The opening is not my strength.  If I win, it's usually through midgame fighting.  So my ideas here may be wrong.  But I would play at R14 or more likely O16, instead of this M17 pincer.]
;B[qb]C[MM:  That looks weird and easy for White to attack.]
;W[qc]TR[pb]C[MM: Here I do not see any obvious reason to not play Q18 instead of this R17.]
;B[pb];W[ic];B[lb];W[kb];B[mb];W[ld];B[ne]TR[pf][pg][qf][qg]
C[MM:  This is Black's obvious good move.  Now White should play calmly near Q14.]
;W[fc]SQ[ic][kb][lc][ld]TR[pd][qc][qf]C[MM: This is a big move, but the other side is bigger because Black cannot easily kill the J17 groups (squares); meanwhile, the Q16 stones (triangles) are in big trouble if Black gets a move near R14.  That is too large a corner to sacrifice.]
;B[dc];W[pf]SQ[dc]C[MM:  Well, Black made a slow (but big) protective move at D17, and White was able to make a good move at Q14.  Good!]
;B[rc];W[rd];B[pc];W[qd];B[sb]TR[cj]C[MM: Too slow.  Black would do better with something like C10.]
;W[ng]C[MM:  Good idea I think, to make a large territory while Black tries to run to the center.  But what if Black does not run to the center?  Since Black is alive in the corner, Black might not run.]
;B[pi]TR[qj][qk]C[MM:  That's a good idea, but trying to live inside White's area, I think playing on the 3rd line instead of the fourth would probably be safer.]
;W[qh]TR[ql]C[MM:  The other side is emptier, so I think that would be the proper direction of play, in accordance with the proverb "play away from strength."]
;B[ql]C[MM:  Good for Black!  Think how much more difficult it would be for Black if White had played there.]
;W[cn]TR[ch][ci][cj][dg][dk][pi][ql]C[MM:  I dislike this White C6 for a couple of reasons.  The Blacks at Q11-R8 are not yet settled, so White can continue to apply pressure and profit there in sente.  And if you are going to attack Black's framework, I think the weak spots around C11 is a better way to do it.]
;B[qi];W[ph]SQ[ng][pd][pf][qc][qd][qh][rd]TR[bp][ci][cj][ck]
[cn][en][eo][fn]C[MM:  Hmm.. Here I would not answer, because the Whites around Q14 seem to have multiple options to live and this Q12 only adds 2 or 3 points to the final score.  At this stage of the game, you can still get, or threaten to get, 10 to 15 points with each move.  Since Black did not respond to your C6, a move near C10 looks natural and profitable to me.  Something like B4 or near F6 also might be good.]
;B[oi];W[nh]TR[bp][ci][cj][ck][cn][dg][dk][eo][fn]C[MM:  This is way too slow.  Black cannot cut.  White should grab the chance to do something with the C6 stone.]
;B[mi];W[dk]C[MM:  Yes!];B[bj];W[bk]TR[cj][di]C[MM:  This is too soft.  C10 or D11 looks better.  You want to cut Black's stones apart, not help Black build a wall and a big corner.]
;B[dj];W[ek];B[jg];W[fe]C[MM:  Good.];B[fg];W[if];B[ig];W[jf]
;B[kf];W[ke];B[lf];W[le]TR[ef]C[MM:  Way too slow.  This is a good time to poke into the area Black wants as territory around E14.]
;B[me];W[nd];B[md];W[od];B[oc];W[mc]SQ[ke][lc][ld][le]CR[jo]
TR[mf]C[MM:  I think this cut is too soon, in the wrong place, and makes a weak shape.  White has made a big empty triangle around M15 (squares), and now has one less liberty.  I think the N14 cut (triangle) looks more promising.  Anyway, the big empty area is now around the N3 area.  Probably the best move is K5 (circle).]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[mf];W[ef]C[MM:  Good.];B[df];W[eg];B[eh];W[dg]
;B[cf];W[cg];B[bg];W[ch]TR[ci]C[MM:  How about C11 (triangle) instead?]
;B[cj];W[ck];B[bh];W[eo]C[MM:  Good!];B[ho];W[jo]C[MM:  Also good!  White seems to be firmly leading now.]
;B[hm];W[fm];B[hk];W[jl]SQ[eq][gp]TR[jm][km][mo]C[MM:  This looks too risky.  It looks like that K8 stone might get cut off, or at least invite some tricky fighting.  Simply playing something like K7, L7, or N5 (triangles) is probably enough to almost assure victory.  If you want some fun fighting where you have the upper hand instead of an uncomplicated win, try playing E3 or G4 (squares).]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[mo]SQ[nm]TR[km][om][oo]C[MM:  This is almost surrounded on three sides.  It seems to be too deep into White's area, so a White move near O7 (square) has a good chance of killing it.  A better Black move would be P5, P7, or peeping with L7 (triangles), or O7 (square).]
;W[pm];B[lm];W[kl];B[lk];W[jm]SQ[gp][ik][jj][ki][ll]TR[jn][kn]
C[MM:  This makes an empty triangle.  I think a better way to connect is with K6 or L6 (triangles).  But probably you should first push through some of Black's cutting points -- J9, K10 or L11, M8, or G4 (squares).]
;B[om];W[on]TR[nk][ol]C[MM:  Here it's better to be more aggressive, with P8 or O9 I think.]
;B[nm]SQ[mo]C[MM:  White let Black connect the N5 stone to safety.  This is horrible for White.  Now the game seems roughly even.]
;W[nn]SQ[jl][jm][jo][jq][kk][kl]TR[mq]C[MM:  I don't like this move because it forces Black to make a good move and connect.  Plus, the K5 groups (squares) are starting to look cut off and weak, so I think a move like N3 (triangle) is much better.]
;B[mn];W[jj];B[ik];W[kj]TR[lj]C[MM:  It's good to connect, but you can do it in sente with M10.]
;B[pl];W[qm]TR[mq]C[MM:  Too small.  It's better to play N3.]
;B[no];W[oo];B[nq]SQ[jj][jl][jm][jo][jq][kj][kk][kl]C[MM:  Now White's big center clump around K5 (squares) are cut off from the corner, and must live independently.  By not playing near N3 a couple moves ago, White lost the chance to make a big territory on the lower side.  Black seems to be ahead now.]
;W[op]TR[gp][hi][hq][lq]C[MM:  This move at P4 is a disaster.  One of the triangles (H11 to connect out or eventually kill some Black stones in the center, G4 for the same reasons, or H3 or M3 to start making some eyes) looks better to me.  Black may now be able to kill the center group.]
;B[np];W[kh];B[kg];W[mh];B[jh]TR[li]C[MM:  This Black move at K12 gives up the chance to cut off White's center.  Black should have played at M11 (triangle).]
;W[lh]TR[li]C[MM:  White rescued the big group -- good!  I think M11 would be a more efficient way to do it.]
;B[ji];W[ki]TR[lj]C[MM:  This is a good time to connect with a bamboo joint at M10.]
;B[ij];W[hg];B[hh];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf]TR[eb][eq][gp][rm]C[MM:  I think saving one stone here is too small.  Better to make a bigger move like E4, G4, S7,or E18.]
;B[ff];W[oe]SQ[cg][ch][dg][ef][eg]TR[ee]C[MM:  No, White should save the five stones around E14.]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[de];W[fh];B[gh];W[fi]SQ[ge]C[MM:  But what about the cutting point at G15??  See variations.]

[qr][qs][re][rf][ro][rp][rq][rr][rs][sp][sq][sr][ss]C[MM:  Good, though I like G4 or E3 (triangles) better.
Looks like roughly 66 for Black, and 55.5 for White, assuming that White protects the G15 cutting point before Black attacks there.  White can still win with skilful endgame play.]
;B[bn]C[MM:  Nice move by Black!];W[bm];B[bo];W[co]TR[ge][gp]

;W[dm];B[do];W[cl]TR[dn]C[MM:  Much better to connect at D6 instead.]

;B[lp];W[mq]SQ[ll][nk]C[MM:  Not so good -- forces Black to connect, which is what he wants to do anyway.  Probably better to connect ot L6 / K6 (triangles), or poke into the Black group with M8 or O9 (squares).]
;B[nr];W[il];B[ip];W[io]TR[jp]C[MM:  What??  Why not play K4?!]
;B[jp]C[MM:  This is why White should have played the previous move at K4.]
;W[jn];B[iq]C[MM:  Black gains a lot.  White is in tatters, and can resign with honor.]
;W[ir]C[MM:  This and White's next 5 moves are pointless and doomed to failure.  White has not enough space for eyes, and too many cutting points.]

;W[qe];B[rh];W[sh];B[rh]C[MM:  And now White has seen a snapback in operation.  I bet White doesn't fall for that again soon.]

;W[po]SQ[pm][qm]TR[qn]C[MM:  Well, it shouldn't have worked.  It would have been safe for White to play R6 instead, and save the two stones at Q7-R7.]

[qg][qq][qs][re][rp][rq][rr][se][sp][ss]C[MM:  Black wins by 58.5.  White's opening was superior, but in the midgame White left too many weaknesses for Black, and in turn White did not fully exploit Black's weaknesses.  Then White made a few blunders late in the midgame and early in the endgame.  Tactical study -- life and death problems especially -- will help a lot.  Also, look for the big empty areas of the board, since they often are where one can profit efficiently.
