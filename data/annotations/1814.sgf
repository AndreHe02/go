RE[W+Resign]

C[Hi, my name is Hasan and I'm playing with the black stones. I'm a beginner in Go, I'm playing it for one month and therefor I think I'm around 30 kyu.

At the beginnig of the game I thought I'm doing very well but than I made many mistakes and didn't know what's going on and I had to resign.

I hope you can give me some hints.

Thank you a lot !];B[pp]C[dede: hi, i'm 9k* on igs. I hope my comment  will be useful

dede: it is good habit to start in upper right corner...];W[dd]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[fp]
(;B[jp]C[dede: Bad, look at the variation];W[gq];B[eq];W[ep]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[gp]C[dede: better at g2 or c2];W[gr];B[go];W[cr]
C[dede: now white has much more than could expect];B[hq];W[hr]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[jr];W[kq];B[jq];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[qj];W[dj]
;B[cc]C[I tried after this point to make the only Joseki I know. I thought it's a good Idea to make a little Territory at this corner.

dede: seems ok, but you just help white to build a wall which can be used to make much greater territory]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]
;W[cf];B[el]C[dede: nice reduction];W[fm];B[gm]C[dede: this move weakens e8 stone. I think about f9, f8, e10 moves]
;W[fl];B[dl]C[dede: Bad. If you are surrounded by an enemy, try to run away, or make a shape with eye potential, or just leave it watching for an occasion for using them somehow.]
;W[fk]C[After this move I tried to block the black player coming in into the right lower side.]
;B[gl];W[hj];B[ik];W[ij];B[jk];W[ki];B[lj];W[qq];B[pq]C[Here I let him do the Joseki that I did before. I blocked to the left and let his Joseki go to the upper right side, becuase I thought he would be too strong, if I let him take the lower side.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq]
C[dede: now you can try to asses who leads in territory. It's obvious that white leads. R17 is still waiting and e8 stones are almost hopeless.]
;W[li];B[mi];W[kj];B[lk];W[kk];B[jj];W[ji];B[kl];W[hk];B[hl]
;W[mh];B[ni];W[nh];B[oh];W[og];B[pi]C[dede: both sides left lots of cutting points here, it's dangerous]
;W[ph];B[oi]C[dede: now 2 black stones at q16 and q14 are very weak]
;W[nf]C[dede: white should q13...];B[pg];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd]
;W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[sd];W[gb];B[ga]C[dede: d19 is correct]
;W[ha]C[I'm trying to live at the corner.];B[ba];W[fa];B[da]
;W[oc]C[At this point I thought, I have a good Teritory at at the right and at the lower side. Now I thought it would be a good Idea to cut through the white stone in the center

dede: it should be considered much earlier. Now any actions can be sucessfull only if white make a mistake.
By the way, white's p17 is unnecesary];B[lg];W[lh];B[me];W[ne]
;B[nd];W[od];B[md];W[oe];B[of];W[ng];B[pe];W[rm];B[rl];W[sm]
;B[en]C[That was a very Important move for me, because I wanted to take the the thre white stones in the lower corner and free my three blackstones.

dede: difficult  way to do it as i see...];W[fn];B[fo];W[eo]
;B[cp]C[After this move I was very happy and thought that I will get the 4 white stones, but I couldn't. At some moves I was not sure which move would be the best for me. Check the coming moves please and tell me where I made mistakes.

dede: strategical mistakes were made early in the game. Now it is almost too late for black, but... look at variation]
;W[do]
(;B[co];W[dn];B[em]C[dede: mistake, look variation a few moves earlier]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[cl];W[bm];B[an];W[bq];B[bl];W[bo];B[gk]
;W[gj];B[is]C[dede: g6 is urgent];W[fr];B[ek];W[fj];B[ej];W[di]
;B[jg]C[dede: too late for anything.];W[gn]C[After this white move I tried to block him. I did'nt want white to come into my Teritory, but I failed.

dede: you had your chance to exploit white's weanesses, now it's his chance, much greater...

I hope you can tell me some big mistakes I made.

Thanks for commenting my game :-)])
