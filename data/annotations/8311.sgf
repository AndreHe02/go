AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[I played this game in person against a 3kyu at a local game club.  Overall, I think the game went well.  I've highlighted some troubling points along the way.  Any advice you could give me will help.



Thank you very much for the review.

J: Hi, my name is Jay and I will be commenting you game.  Myt comments will start with a "J:".]

;W[di];B[ch];W[dm]MA[cq]C[J: Since white is this many points behind, D7 is too slow of a move for this point in the game.  White can alway dive into the corner if he is cut.]
;B[fm]C[Was this a good peep?

J: Yes it is a good peep.  The correct connection for white is at E7 white doesn't allow this peep.  You are taking compensation for his mistake.]
;W[em];B[fn]C[J: Black should not continue with F6 here.  F7 needs to be treated as a light stone that can be used for aji later.  Taking a bigger move elsewhere would be better.]
;W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[J: I would have preferred a block at the other direction with C4.  As it is, white secures his group. See variation.]
;W[cp];B[lp]C[Thoughts on this move?

J: An important thing to learn is that "walls aren't made for territory".  A more efficient way to play is to take the large Q10 point.

You welcome an incursion into the lower side, because you can use the strength of the wall to help you fight.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[kc]C[J: white is playing too slow, and cannot afford to give up sente at this point.]
;B[qk];W[fc];B[dc]MA[cf]C[Is there a better move or does this work?

J: this move does take the corner, but it is small.  black still needs to watch out for the splitting move at C14 later.  Playing C14 itself now may be a good option.]
;W[fe];B[iq]C[J: black is rightfully declaring victory.  but in term of sheer territory, a larger point is to play at Q18.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rp];B[ro]
;W[rq];B[qn]C[J: black is very happy with this exchange.];W[qh]
;B[pi]MA[oj][nj][rf]C[Was this move right?

J: It's OK. a better move is to attack from father away with P10, O10.  When you play closen to a stone, you will make it stronger.  S14 is also interesting, because it takes awak from his base while indirectly securing the corner.]
;W[ph];B[oi];W[oh];B[ni];W[rj];B[oc]MA[ne][me]C[J: P17 is a bad move.  You are helping white connect his weak group and it doesn't seal the corner.  A harsher move is the simple O15 or the greedy N15.]
;W[nd];B[ke];W[nf];B[rf]LB[qe:B][re:A]C[Is there a better move for enclosing the corner?  Maybe A or B?

J: S14 is fine. it would be more prodent to make the O18, N18 trade first.]

J: seems that way.];W[cg];B[bf];W[dg];B[ag];W[ci];B[bi];W[dh]
;B[de];W[mh];B[hj]TR[ke]C[J: H10 is wrong area to focus on, L15 needs help.]
;W[fl];B[ie]C[J:  when trying to save a stone, always reach from the stronger side.]

;W[jd]C[J: white should be greedier with K18. instead of K16.]

(;B[er]C[Is this too greedy or does the mistake come later?  What is the best response?

J: F2 is a good way to block.];W[hp];B[io];W[ip];B[jo];W[hq]
;B[gq];W[eq];B[hr];W[fr];B[gr]C[J: G2 is not needed.

J: The rest is endgame, this will be my last comment.

The main take away for white from this game should be to play more lightly.  Since this is a 5 stone game, white has to tenuki for often and make wider extensions than normally he is comfortable with.

For black, he should observe the relationships between weak and strong groups.  Strong groups that are not easy to die will help create territory elsewhere; while attacking weak groups will itself create territory.

Thanks for showing me this game.];W[jp];B[jq];W[lr];B[kr];W[mr]
