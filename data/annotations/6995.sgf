C[Hi, GTL review.

I have asked some simple questions.             Also please point out other mistakes.
I know there is more mistakes in this game then I can find myself by looking over it,

Thank you for reviewing this game.

Often, white responds at P6 which prevents black from linking up.  See variation for why that works.]

(;W[od]C[Since white didn't play P6, I wonder if black should play R5 ?  not sure.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[ic]LB[ne:B][pe:C][qf:A]C[Is J17 better then the standard A-C

J17 looks ok since it makes a base and deprives white of one.]
;W[qe];B[re]C[Do I need to answer here, or can I just let the group be and let it live small?


I'm wondering if black S15 or black Q16 is better.  If black doesn't play Q16, it is white's sente.]
;W[rf]C[I think white maybe should extend instead of hane..  I'm not sure though !]
;B[pe];W[qf];B[rd];W[pd];B[oe];W[nd];B[og]C[Is it okey to attack now, or will this create to many problems?]
;W[ph];B[oh]C[
This move seems to help white get stronger.

How about playing N14 right away instewad of P12 ?   That splits white into two unsettled groups so black can attack one of them. 

The idea is for black to try to get strong without strenthening either white group.]
;W[pi];B[pg]LB[rg:A]C[Does this help white more then black, since I help white with the A aji?

Black is using up is own liberties so should probably not do this.  Maybe N14 still better than Q13.]
;W[qg];B[mf];W[ke]
(;B[om]C[what about s11 ?  See variations.];W[pl];B[oi]C[
Seems like black should answer the peep to keep possible attack on white]
;W[pm];B[le];W[ld];B[kd];W[kc];B[jd];W[jb];B[nb]C[This is gote.
But I felt that I needed to protect my group, any thoughs?]
;W[mb];B[ob];W[lb]C[I do not think white need this stone. Im happy getting sente]
;B[pj];W[qj];B[qi]C[I wanted to enclose white, but this way I help him getting 2eyes, is this bad?
Sould I let the group stay alone for the time?




How do you decide whether ti give up a stone at R11 or play double hane instead with R9 ?  It takes a bit of reading but is worth studying...]
;W[qh];B[qk];W[rj];B[pk];W[rk];B[ql];W[qn]C[black is making large center so should white play P8 instead of R6 ?]
;B[ol];W[pn];B[no];W[rm]C[thid white move doesn't look so good.  See variation.]

(;B[kf]C[Felt I had a "superior" start, so I played defensive.]
;W[rl]C[black lost the chance];B[df]LB[op:A]C[P4 bigger?

P4 doesn't look so big since the R6 stones are now strong, so white could answer P4 at K3, promising a base at either N3 or G3.]
;W[oq]C[black shouldn't let white get too large a corner here.  How about answering this move at P2 or P4 instead of O3 ?]
;B[nq];W[or];B[op];W[pp];B[nr];W[pr];B[fq]C[white got a large corner]

(;B[lj]C[instead of M10, what happens if black N9 ?  I've played out some variations



In general, black is strong up top and weaker down below.  So black should be helping the lower stones.  So instead of M10, if you don't do N9 either, how about M4, just to quickly make the black stones safe.  The safer the are quickly, the less white can make shape by threatening them.

I've shown some M4 variations.];W[lk];B[mj]C[instead of N10, how about L10 ?]
;W[nl];B[jo];W[kp]C[black is letting white complicate the situation]
;B[lr];W[kq];B[kr];W[jp];B[iq]C[it seems like black is allowing white too easy a time in making shape in black's shere of influence]
;W[ip];B[hp]C[This created a very big fight.

Maybe H2 instead of H4 to get settled quickly at bottom.];W[hr]
;B[jr]C[sometimes J2 is better because it removes a white liberty.]
;W[gp];B[ho];W[gq];B[fp];W[go];B[gn];W[fr];B[er]
(;W[io]C[Instead of this atari, it looks like white saves his bottom stones by using the other atari.  See variations.]

(;W[do];B[en];W[es];B[dn];W[cn];B[cq];W[is]C[just a mistake.  if white has lost the battle here, then instead of J1, making life in the midddle is most important.   Perhaps white L6 or K9.]
;B[co];W[mq];B[mn]C[Big mistake, with N2 I could live simple without much of a fight.

Yes, I agree.];W[mr];B[ms];W[ls];B[ks]C[From what I found out, doing this or connect at O1 is not much of a different.]

;W[mm];B[gs];W[ls]C[
Does black have to lose all these stones ?];B[hs]C[I lost becouse of a mistake, But I felt I was still ahead in the game


Is this H1 needed ?];W[jh]C[Started to feel that white just wanted to hope for my mistakes

Besides white capturing large black group, just the fact that white lived inside black's sphere of influence is a huge gain for white.]
;B[hh]C[
Black H12 lets K12 escape.  How about black K10 instead ?];W[jj]
C[
However, from white's point of view, if black D10 makes it too difficult to invade, what if white plays c11 to maximize possible base at either c8 or b14 next ?]
;B[dj];W[bo]C[Started to feel again he just wanted to live by my mistakes


Instead of black C4, how about black B4 ?];B[cp]C[B4 better?]

(;W[fe]C[
For white's point of view, this F15 doesn't really head towards eye-making ground since there's black stones all around.  I would think just playing the 3-3- point might be the best, to make quick life inside black's potential territory.]
;B[im];W[ik];B[if]C[
I believe the important goal for black here is to try to kill the upper left white stones.   Probably a move in the corner is best, such as 3-3 or c16.]
