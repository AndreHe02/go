C[Hello! I am Chris Dams and I'll be your reviewer today ;-).

The most important thing I am going to say is "urgent moves before big moves". Moves that stabalize your groups or hurt the groups of the opponent are called urgent moves. It is important to play those moves immediately. Both you and your opponent miss a lot of urgent moves. The urgent moves are actually a lot bigger than your average big move.

You ask about the "moyo" on the top. Well that is not a moyo, it is not big enough to be a moyo, it is just a side. You could have built something moyo-like if you had gotten to extend your top side before White plays there on G15. The reason that you lost that group on the top is a tactical error as pointed out further on.

You also ask about yose. I wouldn't worry too much about it. You did very well in yose. You basically won a lost game because your opponent made a lot of very, very bad moves in yose. Move 155, Black H2, just gives away a stone. Especially the way you continue the next move is just giving away a stone without any benefits.]

;B[rr];W[kq];B[fq]C[CD: As a rule one would approach the corner from the more open side. That would mean C6 here. The reason is very simple: if you get the less open side the opponent will get the more open one and more territory can be made on the latter because it is more open.]
;W[pe];B[nd];W[qc]
(;B[qf]C[White played a contact move. In most cases you want to respond to that. Also, approaching a stone as close as you do here does not really work as an attacking more. White could have played like in the variation in the next move and that would have given him a big corner in which he is not even confined. See also the variation of this move for a joseki.]

(;W[qd];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[dn]
(;B[jc]C[Big move, but the variation is bigger. This move is just big, the variation is urgent. White can harass your lonely stone.]

(;W[ck]C[I don't understand why White does not play the variation to attack the lone black stone.]
;B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[dr];W[hq];B[fo]C[Play C3 instead and then think to yourself "thank you very much for granting me this huge corner, my dear oppontent". Getting the corner immediately makes sure that those black stones will not get into any trouble.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[fm];B[gn];W[ge];B[dj]C[It is not so good to play close to a strong stone when invading. Your stones can get heavy easily. Also, White has the easy answer of C10. Giving him easy territory while denying your stone a base.]
;W[cb]C[White should have responded to your invasion.]
(;B[ch]C[You punish his negligence but could have done it more severily as in the variation.]
;W[in]
(;B[hm]C[Running out can hurt your two lonely stones. Better have your group care for its own instead of running towards another weak group. See variaton.]
;W[fk];B[eh];W[fg]
(;B[fi]C[Again, instead of running, this group can take care of itself in sente.]
;W[eb];B[ec]C[F18 defends the upper side better.];W[hc];B[hd]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[hb];B[fb]C[Playing J17 kills the two white stones, I think. Disconnecting stones that were not connected in the first place is not useful.]

(;W[lb]C[White is acting like a coward. He can jump farther or even better try to get out of there causing Black big problems. See variation.]
;B[ld];W[ne];B[lc];W[bf];B[bj];W[pf]C[This is big too, but responding at B9 is more urgent for White.]
;B[qg];W[me];B[lf];W[md];B[mc];W[od];B[nc];W[ng];B[gf]C[Nice sequence you found there.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[ee];B[ef];W[ni];B[lh];W[gg];B[hg]C[E13 is the right move here.]
;W[eg];B[hf];W[dg];B[kk]C[This move does not do very much. G12 is bigger. B9 is bigger. P10 is bigger.]
;W[br]C[Defending the territory on the other side on B9 is much bigger than this.]
;B[gh]C[Yes, huge move.];W[bk];B[gj];W[qk]C[The white position is not yet very strong. It may be unwise to start an attack there.... White had better play S15 first, have you respond and invade then.  Players should not be so hasty invading.]
;B[pk]C[You get to kill White here but what if you hadn't succeeded doing that? Then this move is the way to be certain that your loss will be huge. White does not risk much if he plays Q8 now. He has good chances of either living or escaping that way. Better play Q10 now and keep white disconnected. That way you may very well get the opportunity to do a bit of damage to either the white bottom territory or the white group in the top right.]
