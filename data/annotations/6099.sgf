AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[This game is played by Al (8k) and Mk (unranked) on a 30min plus 30 secs byo-yomi and there were only around 5 minutes left per player when white resigned, so we took our time to think about the moves.
Last game played with 4 stones handicap was won by Al by a large margin.
We both have questions about the game, so you'll find comments starting with "al" and "mk"

Al: I think I played this game without reading too much. I realise I made very bad sequences at the center of the board around move 90, but I think the whole problem appears earlier, at the openning. It seems like I have a problem with handicapped games, as I don't really know how to play "lightly", is there any suggestion you could make in this point? Thanks for the review!!

catch22 (2k): Hi, I'll be reviewing this game. My general advice to White in playing handicap games is to play patiently. Try to catch up by playing slightly more efficient moves than your opponent. You have until the end of the game, so there is no need to rush. If the handicap is fair, you are supposed to be behind for pretty much all of the game. At the start of the game, focus on getting a position that offers enough opportunities to catch up later.

Mk: It seems like I'm not doing too bad on this game, I got a few good sequences on the center of the board, but I'm very disappointed with my performance on the upper-left corner. This is the first game we played on 30min plus byoyomi and I didn't do too bad. On the last games I've been playing I've tried to get a big territory on the center, but Al manages to reduce it considerably (except today), is there any way I could fix it? Where could I have played or tenukied to avoid such reductions?

catch22: It is difficult to make territory at the center, so that should not be your objective. At the start of the game, it is much more efficient to get territory in the corners and at the sides of the board. Of course, you can build influence towards the center, but this should then be used for attack, or to create a mojo (then, as your opponent invades it, use this as an opportunity to create territory elsewhere). Do, however, not aim to create territory in the center. It is not efficient.]
PL[W];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nc];W[qj];B[of]C[Al: This is a move I'm not used to but tried to do my best to punish it... what should I have done?

catch22: This is indeed an unusual move. The best way to punish it may be to actually play elsewhere on the board. First of all, the Black stone does not impose a big threat. Nothing too bad will happen if Black gets another move here. Secondly, sente is valuable at the start of the game, and in handicap games it is usually good if White gets a presence everywhere on the board quickly, so use this opportunity. Thirdly, the stone is placed a bit awkwardly, and there can be different ways to exploit this. It is good to keep this aji (latent possibilities) alive. E.g. there is a possibility to cut with P15. This does not seem that useful right now, but it is good to keep the option open.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[qd];B[qc];W[re]
(;B[oc]C[catch22: Playing at Q17 is slightly better, see variation.]

(;W[gc]C[Al: I wanted to avoid that black got a huge moyo on the upper side, so I invaded here... but I don't know if this was the right place to do so... or the right timing

catch22: The placement looks about right. You do not want to be too close to the Black wall on the right. I however I think that F17 is slightly better (see variation).

I think the timing is right. If Black gets another move here first, e.g. at F17, it becomes difficult for White to deal with the top.]
;B[id]C[Mk: I think it's not the right way to play with my thickness on the upper right corner. Any suggestion?

catch22: I think this is fine actually. If you don't play a pincer, White won't hesitate and make a base with K17, negating most of your thickness. Furthermore, as the white stone is a little bit too far away from your stone in the top left corner, White does not have that many good continuations.

I also think that playing for influence in the center at the fourth line is better than playing for territory at the third. If you would have played at J17, White could play at J16, and the black stones would end up being too overconcentrated.]
;W[ic]C[AL: Where should I have gone? Could you show me any other better sequence? B managed to create a wall facing the center of the board.

catch22: I don't think there is anything wrong with this. Attaching is a good way for White to settle his stones. It also makes the J16 stone stronger, but that's okay, as Black is strong at the top right anyway (White's aim should be to eventually put pressure on the D16 stone). Also, if Black is not careful, his stones will end up overconcentrated. 

Also note that as Black started off with more stones at the top of the board, it is only natural that he ends up with the better position afterwards. 

Furthermore, as this is a handicap game, White can only win by playing significantly better than Black. So using sequences where both players play equally well, which is the kind of sequences that are usually shown, will make it difficult to demonstrate how White can catch up. :-)]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[ie];W[kc]C[catch22: This may actually have been an overplay. See the variation for the next move.]

(;B[kd]C[catch22: This move lets White of the hook. I think White would have been in problem if Black had played K18 instead. See variation.]
;W[jb]C[Al: I think I couldn't have pushed more, I've tried some reading and I can't see a better result for white if white pushes deeper.

catch22: I think you're right. If you extend to K15, you end up with the same result as was shown in the variation for the previous move (where Black played K18).]
;B[je];W[ld];B[ke];W[lb];B[mc]C[catch22: There is no need to play this peep right now. The N17 stone is not that valuable. White will not play here himself, so you can always play this move later, should you want to. If nothing else, you now spoiled a ko threat.]
;W[lc]C[catch22: This result at the top is good for White. The White group is alive, has access to the center, and has effectively countered the influence of the black stones in the top right. Black got a few center-facing stones in return. However, these are not too strong. if he is not careful, these may get cut off eventually.]

(;B[fc]C[Mk: I'm not very proud about the way I played this corner, any suggestion?

catch22: It is a bit difficult. You want to strengthen the corner, while at the same time not weaken your five stones facing the center. These are already a bit of a burden.

I don't think that this attachment works very well. It just encourages White to move out into the center, which he wants to anyway. Furthermore, it does not really give you a strong position, as you have to look after the center stones before your corner is sufficiently soldified.

See variation for a better way of playing.];W[gd];B[fe]C[catch22: This is not good. It leaves too many weaknesses in Black's position. Better to play at F16, or E17.]
;W[ge]C[Al: Should I have peeped instead? He would get a huge wall...

catch22: I presume you ask if you should have played at F16 instead. That, however, is not called a peep. A peep is a threat to cut, whereas F16 would be an actual cut (that's another reason why Black's move at F15 was not good. It actually makes White's stone at G16 a peep in restrospect).

Anyway, to get back to your question. I think it is better to play the way you did (at G15), than to cut at F16. The move at G15 has the advantage that it weakens the five black stones at the center. Furthermore, the weakness in Black's position at F16 still remains. Black cannot even efficiently defend this weakness, because if Black plays at F16, his corner stone at D16 is placed very inefficiently. It is far too close to the three stone wall. So it is quite likely that White may still play F16 later on in the game, so it is not urgent to play there.]
;B[me]C[catch22: Black could consider sacrificing the five stones in the center. Strategically, they are not that important.]
;W[le];B[lf];W[cf]C[Al: I didn't want black to extend to the side so I played here...

catch22: I think that's okay. The black stones here are still weak, so you should try to exploit that while you can.]
;B[ch]C[Al: and got pincered.

catch22: This complicates things, however, White should not be too worried. Black has to look after his corner and the pincer stone, which are both weak, whereas White only has one stone to look after.]

(;W[ee]C[catch22: This move looks a bit funny. It does not really help the C14 stone. I think it is better for White to play D13 (see variation).]
;B[de]C[Al: after the shock of the pincer, I made a few reading mistakes which lead to a complicate fight. I think this is all because the C14 stone...

catch22: This is a good move by Black. Black should separate the two white stones.]
;W[ef]
(;B[ff]C[catch22: This is not a good move. The black F15 stone is not important, and neither are the white stones at E14 and E15. Playing at D14 (see variation) is much better.]
;W[ed]
(;B[eg]C[catch22: Another bad move. Black now has seven stones at the top left corner, and they are all very weak and not working well together. Black should look at the stones that are on the board, decide which are the most important, and do something with those. E.g. D14 and F16 are both better moves (see variations).]
;W[fd];B[ec]C[Mk: I think D14 or D17 are better?

catch22: Yes, this is another poor move. It is pretty much as bad as passing, as White can simply cut at D17. Black D17 is not that good either, as White will simply play D14, and it will still be difficult for Black to live in the corner. Black must play D14.]

(;W[fg]TR[ff][fe]C[catch22: Not good. The two marked stones are not important. White now gives Black a chance to play D14 after all.]
;B[gf]TR[ff][fe]C[catch22: It is still better to play D14. The two marked stones are not important. They are for instance, not cutting stones. Furthermore, they do not stop White from getting into the center either. White can still play H14 if he wants to.]
;W[dg]C[catch22: This exchange harms White. It weakens the white stone at F13, it gives up the chance to play atari at E12 instead, and results in bad shape (White probably has to eventually connect at D14). 

As Black can handle the cut at D17 anyway (by sacrificing the E17-F17 stones), White should simply play at D14.]
;B[eh];W[dc];B[cc];W[db]
(;B[fb]TR[ec][fc]C[Mk: Is C18 better in order to save the corner stones?

catch22: Yes, F18 does not work. Black simply cannot save the two marked stones, so playing C18 is Black's only option. See variation.]
;W[gb];B[hf];W[jj]C[Al: I wanted to avoid Black making a good extension around here... but I think I played too deep inside black territory

catch22: This is indeed not a good move for several reasons. Firstly, Black only has influence in the center. It is not territory yet. As it is also difficult to make territory in the center, White does not need to take action yet. Secondly, this move is too single-minded. White should look for a more constructive move, i.e. one that expands his own position, while at the same time reducing Black's center influence. You have to try to make your stones work together, and that is definitely not the case here.]
;B[gh];W[pn]
(;B[oo]C[Mk: I don't know much of josekis, is P5 a right move?

catch22: Not really, as it is lacking a clear purpose. It is not making any territory. The corner is still open to an invasion, and this move also does not help to create territory at the bottom (it is too high for that). It also does not reduce White's territory at the right. 

See variation for a better way to play.];W[on];B[qn]C[Al: Once again that strange move]

(;W[qm]C[catch22: I would be tempted to play R5 (see variation). R7 results in an overconcentrated position for White.]
;B[qo];W[rm];B[np]C[catch22: The result is not great for either player. White's stones are a bit too overconcentrated. Although Black looks to have gotten a large corner, the shape of the stones is poor, and there is still lots of bad aji. A white invasion at R3 looks dangerous for example.]
;W[og]C[catch22: This is too slow. It only expands White's territory at the left by a little, and at the same time helps Black to territory in the center. I would suggest establishing a position at the left or bottom of the board, e.g. by playing C6 or F3.]
;B[mh];W[md]
(;B[ne]C[catch22: This is bad shape again (another empty triangle). It also leaves Black's position a bit weak, e.g. White may eventually play M13 to good effect. Playing N14 is better (see variation).]
;W[ni];B[mi]C[catch22: The O11-N11 exchange is helping Black much more than it does White. White should leave this part of the board alone for now.]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[mk];B[lk];W[dh];B[dj];W[fh]C[catch22: This is very bad. The F13 stone is not important, and not worth saving. All that White does is create a weak and heavy group of stones. It also forces Black to connect at E11, which he does not mind.]
;B[ei];W[fi]C[Al: I wanted to recover the F12 stones and make something with the tengen stone...

catch22: These three stones do not help the tengen stone at all. They are only a burden This sequence was better left unplayed, so that at least White could play atari at E11 instead]
;B[mm];W[nn];B[mn];W[ll];B[kl];W[ml];B[fj];W[gi]C[catch22: White really should not try to save these stones. They are heavy, short of liberties, and even if they can be saved (which is very unlikely), Black will be compensated by the damage that White does in doing so. It is better to sacrifice them. For instance by playing H10 which threatens to save them.]

(;B[hh]C[catch22: Black can play at G10, which is much better.]
;W[hj];B[jk];W[jh]C[catch22: This is not good. White must run away now, e.g. by playing H8. K12 does not help White to make eyes, or to escape. It also does not threaten Black, he can safely ignore it.]
;B[ki];W[ii]C[Al: horrible sequence...

catch22: Indeed.];B[ik];W[hk];B[hi];W[gj];B[ij];W[fk];B[di]
C[catch22: This is bad shape, and it is also not necessarily sente. So Black should probably just play D8. This helps the black stones better, and also puts more pressure on the white stones in the center.]

(;W[df]C[catch22: White does not need to connect. See variation.]
;B[oh]TR[dj][di][ei][eg]C[catch22: Locally, this is a nice move by Black. However, the marked black stones are weak. It is more important to look after these first.]
;W[nh]C[Al: White didn't read at all.];B[ng];W[pg];B[nj];W[oi]
;B[nl];W[lm];B[kn];W[ln];B[nm];W[lo];B[mo];W[ph];B[pm]C[White resigns.

catch22: This is painful, although not necessarily a reason to resign. If White now plays O9, the damage is still limited. Black should then probably play at C8, or thereabouts. If he does not, a subsequent attack by White may be difficult to handle for Black. 

I think Black should have played O9 instead of Q7. It will be difficult for White to do rescue the seven stones that are cut off, especially because they are very short of liberties. Furthermore, as White cannot immediately defend the cut at Q7 anyway, Black may still have a chance to play there later. 

Anyway, it was an interesting game, and I hope that my comments have been useful.]

Now Black can continue in various ways. Black can go all out to kill the White stones. This will probably succeed, but is still risky (especially in a handicap game where the other play is stronger). So it is probably better for Black to either confine the white group (even if it lives, which is still doubtful, Black gets sufficient compensation on the outside), or to chase it around the board. As White struggles to make two eyes, Black can get influence and territory.]
