C[  Hello !
 I lost this game by almost exactly the komi, that I didn't have, KGS said I'm 1dan, which I am probably not :) .
 There are two big questions in my playing, one in the very beginning, one in the yose, but I liked this game and I wished it to be commented, that's why I sent it to you :) . I hope you'll like to comment !
PS: I am french.
PPS: My name is Clement, I am supposed to be 3kyu on KGS with my "serious" and active account, Tilwen (I forgot to introduce myself :-) ).

Hi, my name ist Klaus, I am from germany. 

Generaly a time setting of 20SD is not a good base for a serious game and reviews should be for serious games.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]C[I guess it's hard to say if something around R10 is better than this D4, but the following moves made me think a bit.

This cant be bad for white or black. It is just normal.];B[oc]
C[Here you don't want black to build a huge side with Q10, so white has to invade I guess. That's why I played R9, but then I was not happy with my position. Is there an other thing to do ?]
;W[qk]C[again, this move cannot be bad.

Have trust in normal moves!];B[qo];W[qh]C[This position was already played in a Honinbo Match. (1959) And white won this game!]
(;B[jq]LB[qf:A][qm:B]C[Black has taken an other very big points and white is quite weak on the right side ...

Here is a second opening question : where is the biggest point now ? I played D10 because I'm quite fond of the san-ren-sei, but maaybe K16 or K17 ir more important now.

First of all, white is not weak on the left side, as A and B are miai.
Second of all, maybe a pro might tell you, than one move is 1-2 Points better than the other, but for me as KGS 4d this seems not important at all. Anny normal move will do. I would not play d10, because I dont like san-ren-sei. Maybe the low move at c10 is better, because p17 and k3 are low and secure, but then again it seems just a matter of taste.

Summary: You dont loose the game here at all.]
(;W[dj]
(;B[gq]LB[kp:A]C[Is that black move good, or K16 is better ? I answered it, maybe I shouldn't ...

White can reduce with a move at A, so b cant hope for a big moyo here. So I dont like g3.]
(;W[eq];B[fd]C[Here I saw the pincer because if white D14, black K16 for instance, white is in trouble (I think this, but I am not sure and not very confident in the opening questions, so any comment is welcome :) ).]
(;W[id]LB[df:A]C[And this pincer is not on wikipedia or eidogo :(

Well it was played in 20 pro games...

Still I prefer the simple move at A]
(;B[ef]C[I guess this answer is suggested by the one with a komoku pincer, but now I dunno what to play : C14, take terrotory as I did, D14, F17 or something to threat a cut ?]
(;W[cf];B[kd]C[I feel F17 is a big point for white now, I don't know why ...

F17 is bad, because it weakens j16.];W[if];B[gf]TR[fd][ef]C[Here is a big problem of quite a lot of my games : when a stone of mine is taken in a pincer, I really often play a tobi towards the center, but after my opponent play, I don't have any base and don't know how to secure my stones ...

But what about the black stones, do they have a base?

Maybe the pincer at j16 was bad or at least to complicated.

Still the position is ok for white.]
(;W[ke]LB[mc:A][kd:B]C[That's why I played that, and I did let the cut because of a misreading :)


This ist the first bad move by white. not because of the cut or something like sit, but because you lose the invasionpoint at A.

The stone at B was weak, bevore w attached here, so dont strenthen it.]
;B[le];W[kf];B[jd]C[What could be the move here ? I saw after the game that J17 was kind of sente because of the cut at M16, but then I still have to play J15, which can be directly played now maybe ?

There ist no good move, so another reason why L15 was bad.]
(;W[ld]C[This is a clear mistake, I didn't take time to think, I thought my time was shrinking ...]
;B[md];W[lc];B[mc];W[lf];B[me];W[ic];B[kc];W[cn]C[I guess the K15 or J15 cut is really big, I don't know why I didn't potect ... I was thinking that the left side was really nice for me.]
(;B[dc]C[This is interesting too : should I play C17 as I did or try to cut with E17 ?]
(;W[cc];B[ed];W[db];B[ec]
(;W[de]C[nice for white. secured the corner in sente.];B[eb]
;W[re]LB[rd:C][qf:A][qm:B]C[Here i was a bit afraid of the security of my right group, because I planned to invade the lower side. But I closed black's corner in the same way ...

white had A and B miai, so white was save.
Normal move lokaly is C.

You can invade or better reduce the lower side right now.];B[rd]
LB[kp:B][pr:A]C[Normal her are A and B.];W[mq];B[jo];W[mo];B[qm]
;W[mm]C[Were these two tobi the best moves to go out ? I am not really good with invasions ...

Well, n3 was a bad move, the tobis are ok.];B[rf];W[rg];B[qf]
(;W[sf]C[??

Move 50 and you start playing on the first line.
I am suprised. You ctiticised lots of good fuseki moves, but here you dont see, that this is a mistake?

anny move is better than a move on the frist line.]
(;B[qe]C[big mistake by black, white had no follow up here.]
;W[pr]C[There are some classical sequences with this kind of shimari right ? What can they be ?

Maybe here P2 could have been better, because it was sente, it gave some points to black but I could have attacked the black group on the left after this ?

Q2 is a clasical test move, but you got to play it as a test, BEVORE you invade, to see how b answeres]
;B[or]

no.];W[qp]

yes.]

;B[on]
(;W[rn];B[om];W[nn]C[That move was a mistake because it was not sente as I thought first, I should have played Q7, but maybe my group around N5 would have been more hurt ...

S6 was the mistake.];B[np];W[mp];B[pm];W[rm];B[ln]C[He made almost the same mistake as i did(or he knew it was not sente, possibly), except this was useful for his group]

yes.

yose is indeed the problem here.];W[cb];B[mf]

yes d12, even f5 is bigger.];B[fo]
