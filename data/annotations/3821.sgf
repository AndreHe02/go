C[Hi!  I am a 4k on kgs (havent played in a while though) and hope my comments are helpful.  


[please review for black. game questions: (1) what happened in the top right corner? (2) also identify any places i was lucky to escape due to a large error by white (3) comment on my general game style, weaknesses, what i did right\]

Final comments:  

  I think that you play the opening fairly well.  In fact,of the people around your rank  that I`ve commented on for the GTL, you seemed to handle it best!  

To me you have three weaknesses in your play and all are in the middlegame:

1.  A tendency to play to tight.  Frequently you were playing very close to the opponents stones.

  This is important defensively.  A analogy would be in baseball how a infielder is better farther back because he has more time to react.   See move 138.

2.  You need to develop a "sense of danger".  You allowed wayyy to many cuts.  Anytime you see those atari followed by double atari there is almost always a disaster to follow.  Try NEVER to allow it under any circumstances!  If you have to make a defensive move---well so be it.  

Avoid large weak groups--NEVER allow two in the same area of the board  One weak group is tollerable but you must make sure that you always have 2 options open for living (making life, fleeing in direction x, fleeing in direction y, and linking up to another group).  If your opponent reduces you to one then immediately increase it to 2 or make life immediately)  Losing a big group normally loses the game. 

3.  This one is a problem everyone has.  What is the biggest move.  One good rule of thumb is that once you feel the center has pretty much been divided up and there are no large moves left start grabbing the corners and sides.  The center is so hard to get a lot of points that almost always what you get on the side is worth more.

If you are interested in book for a bit of study I would recommend Lessons in Go Techniques by Cho Hun-hyeon.

Good luck in your go!
