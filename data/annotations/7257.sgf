C[Hi, my name is Ashish (Flamer on KGS), and I will be reviewing your game.  For simplicity and lack of originality, I will just put "Me:" before any comments I make.]
;B[gg]C[Me: For a 9x9 game, this can be a bit low, I usually play at the 4-4 point, as in most games.]
;W[dc]C[Caissa: hi im new :)];B[ee];W[gd]
(;B[cg]C[Me: This move is okay, but I think it could be higher (see variation).  It works to create a hold over the bottom terriitory, but isn't too useful combined with the stone at tengen to create a strong overall moyo.  See Variation.]
;W[ec]C[Caissa: i want to play go
Caissa: i want to learn go]
(;B[ce]C[hikaru361 [12k\]: doing good so far =)];W[hf]
(;B[gf]C[Me:This move, while it works to secure the center, is not as useful as securing the bottom.  It is worth more points overall.  With this move, you lose the right side.  See variation.]
;W[ge]
(;B[ff]C[Me: This shape is called the bent 3, and is considered a bad shape.  It has less "liberties" (areas you can play that are connected) than a normal set of stones.  Avoid making it as much as possible.  See Variation.]
;W[cd]
(;B[de]C[Me: This move is also ceding points.  You should play more forward, because that place isn't particularly in danger.  See variations.]
;W[be];B[bf];W[bd];B[fd];W[fc]
(;B[dd]C[Me: This move does nothing, because white already has a wall at D7.  Better to play elsewhere.]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[hg];B[hh];W[he];B[hc]C[Me: This move will eventually die, because you cannot attain life, or 2 eyes.]

hikaru361 [12k\]: ok

(;B[bd]C[Me: Playing higher in this case is good, because it creates two possible connections and works to threaten the white's upper left corner.  This is what is called sente, because if your opponent doesn't respond, he will lose a number of points.]

(;B[ce]C[Me: This move works to create a larger moyo, and threatens white's hold over the upper left area.]
