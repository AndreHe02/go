C[I am 3k(IGS) with black and palying with a 3K with white.
I would be gratefull to seek for advice on this game.
I lost in the game.

Thank you in advance for your kindly advice.

MM: It was a very interesting game and I like to comment it. If you have questions or you will explore mistakes in my review, please tell me. To sign my comments they begin with "MM:"]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[dp];W[cj];B[pp]C[
 simcar 3k*: hello.];W[np]C[
MM: Unusual. This is a choice for special circumstances when White wants to keep control of the center. But there is nothing special here.]
;B[pn];W[pq];B[qq];W[oq];B[qr];W[kq]LB[qf:B][ql:A][cn:C][fq:D]
C[MM: Black is better off. He has a secure big corner with access to the center, while White has a cramped group which is open at the side. White is left with a move at A to undermine Blacks corner so a black approach at A looks attractive. On the other hand a white move at C would urge Black to play something like C, but since the bottom is already played out it is an unattractive vincinity for both.]
;B[cm]C[Anything wrong until now ?
I am thinking should I play F17, or G17, or F16. Or should I play C14 to attack ?

MM:  In my opinion C7 is a good move and the right direction. A move around F17 has no impact on White and doesn't take the initiative.]
;W[cg]
(;B[cf]LB[bd:A][ce:B]C[MM: To prevent the white slide to A, but this is too close. Attaching helps the defender. Simply enclosig with B and attacking from a distance wpuld have been better. (See Var)]
;W[bf]C[Is it better to defence on C15  instead of D13 ?

MM: The bad move is C14. Now Black has a problem. If he develops thickness he has to do it in sente, otherwise White will erase it with an extension at the top. Let's look at C15  (see var).]

;B[dc]LB[kc:A][lc:B][mc:C]C[MM:  Gaining territory in sente instead of being under attack is a success for White. Now how to deal with the black thickness? Let's look at  A , B and C (see Var).]

(;W[ic]C[Is it right to pincer the W28 ?

MM: It is a holy duty ;-). White J7 is too close to the black thickness.]
;B[kc];W[mc];B[ke]LB[jd:A]C[MM: I would prefer A since L15 leaves the option for White to play at L18. (see Var)]

(;W[if];B[id];W[jc]LB[kd:A]C[MM: Now Black A is called for. (see var)]

(;B[jd]LB[kd:A]C[MM: Letting White connect throws away the attack. Black should have played A.]
;W[kb];B[lc]LB[hc:A][qf:B][eq:C]C[MM:  Better not to ply here at all. Black runs into a hane on the head of two stones, which is bad shape. A is bigger and B and C too]
;W[lb];B[md];W[nd];B[me];W[ne];B[mf];W[hc];B[hd]C[Black seems lose a lot in this attack

MM: I agree. Black is behind now.];W[rd]LB[ql:A][fq:B]C[MM: Too small Since the upper right is secure this is only a big endgame move. A and B are much bigger.]
;B[qj];W[qh]C[would P9 be better

MM: Again too small. White needs too many stones for the already secure territory at the upper left and Black can't close the door to the center there with just one move. I guess the lower left is biggest now. Locally P9 seems to be better since White can't invade between Q6 and P9.]
;B[oj];W[og]LB[eq:A]C[MM: White works hard to be overconcentrated. To prevent a black moyo in the center he can play on the center himself. Now Black has a big move at A.]
;B[gq]C[MM: This to greedy. In our Go-Club this occurs sometimes in handicaps games and is called "the fools-enclosure".]
;W[cq]C[Anyway to kill this W52 ?

MM: I'm too weak to answer this question. My experience says no.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[bp];B[bo];W[br]LB[ap:A]C[MM: Fighting spirit calls Black to play the ko at A. (see Var)]

(;B[dr];W[cr];B[es];W[aq]LB[nh:C][ej:A][kn:B]C[MM: Now it is time for Black to think really big. Consider the center as black territory. If it is White's turn to move he would lke to step in either at A, B or C. A seems biggest so I suggest to play there. (see var)]

(;B[cn]C[MM: This is too small. I would play A now.];W[pm]C[If B49 was in P9, would the situation be better ?

MM: Since P10 is in place now the situaiton is completly different. White has more territorry, Black has the greater thickness. So White should reduce, not invade. Q7 is not really a threat.]
;B[qm];W[ql]C[MM: Now I recommend Black A (see var)]
(;B[pl]C[MM: This helps the opponent];W[om]C[MM: Black A is still necessary (see Var)]

(;B[ol]C[MM: This is the wrong direction];W[qn];B[rm];W[po]
;B[on];W[oo];B[nm];W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[sq];W[pr]
(;B[rr]LB[fi:B][ej:A]C[B83 on S1 be better ?

MM: No. (see var). But the game is over now. Black has no territory. White jumps to A or B now.]
;W[qp]C[MM: 3 points gote.];B[jp]LB[nh:B][ej:A]C[MM: A would have made miai of B and K4
The following moves at the bottom don't show the desire of Black to take sente and build a big moyo. Since the rest is endgame, my extended comment ends here (except for a few short notes).

Later you have some endgame questions. To answer this, I would play Black first there and count, then I would play with White first there and count and then compare the results. I think if would be better for your go-development if you do this by yourself, than listen to my results..]

If I play the endgame better, would I win the game ?

Thank you again for your kind advice.

MM: I think the cause of your loss is not your endgame (although you can improve it) but the way you deal with your thickness. In the beginning you failed to use it to attack J17. Later you miss several chances to build a really big moyo. 

I hope my comments were useful. Please apologize if they were too harsh.
