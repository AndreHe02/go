C[bkamins: Hi, I would be thankful for the comments for black. I post my more detailed questions and thoughts at the moves. I have feeling that I had troubles with the direction of play and yoseki in this game.

HWC: Some general comments: Don't get sealed in! In the bottom left, there was some reading to do, but it was important to determine that the result was decent, instead of just making sure that the stones would live. Maybe even better to give up stones than to let white seal in so completely?

On top right, I noted some slow moves that let white get extra moves on the outside. It's almost always better to be the one getting extra moves on the outside.

Black was still in the game after the large capture. However, at this point, when all groups are settled, counting is a must. Determine where the biggest territories can be made! the gray area in the upper middle left was left alone for far too long.

Other than that, black played well to get an advantage in the lower right corner, and the capture was excellent after a possible white overplay.

I feel that you already know what the good directions of play are; it's just very important to start a sequence knowing that it will fit into the whole board position, instead of regretting afterwards.

I always have so many ideas running around when reviewing, I'm not too sure if it's coherent or even very helpful even after looking over my own comments a couple of times. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Walther];B[pq];W[pc];B[cp];W[po];B[pk];W[cd];B[qo]C[bkamins: Maybe O4 would be better?

HWC: This is fine, it prevents white from making shape by attaching at r3 while taking territory.]

(;B[dq]C[HWC: But maybe now things get a little tricky. Why not atari from d5? (sort of like playing a taisha variation, but c6 is badly placed).]
;W[do]
(;B[er];W[fq];B[cr];W[fr];B[pp]C[bkamins: This was probably too slow. Should be E16 as I feel now.

HWC: I feel like it's hard to say. this move is very large and erases a lot of corner aji. White still has a weakness at e4, and won't be able to get both shimaris]

;W[bm];B[co];W[dn];B[am];W[bl];B[ap];W[al];B[an];W[fo]C[This seems to be a bad result for black. Strong players dislike being sealed in. and for only ten points?]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[pe]C[bkamins: Was this approach OK. I still feel that E16 might work out better.

HWC: I think this is fine.  You may build a very large moyo. Also, if you enter at e16, white will attack and possibly built up a large moyo on the right. This is the disadvantage of being sealed in the corner.]
;W[ph]C[bkamins: I did not know how to best reply this. Maybe simply O15 better than in the game?

HWC: I think you're right, o15 is probably better. when you r17, you make white strong on the upper side so that jumping out at o15 can be answered with o12. Also, see var. for n16.]

(;B[qc];W[qb];B[qd];W[ob];B[rb]C[HWC: This move is too slow. The corner is not big at the moment. And even if you had o15, now white can o12]
;W[ra];B[nd];W[nc];B[md];W[lc];B[ld];W[kc];B[rf]C[HWC: ??? Now that white has let black create thickness, black must attack. Maybe o12?]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[pl]
(;B[qm]C[HWC: When black has stones to help, try atari in the crosscut. I'm too weak to know the right answer, but I'll give a few var.]

;W[lh];B[mi]C[bkamins: As it turned out this was not very good. Maybe K15 better or somwhere around E16?]
;W[ng];B[of]C[HWC: p13 is not important. Maybe k15 to poke out head?]
;W[lf];B[nf];W[od];B[rc]C[HWC: this move is not necessary, there is still space around s12 to make eyes. l15 instead.]
;W[oe];B[mf];W[ke]C[HWC: White looks too easy getting this move. Weak group has turned into huge thickness. This is because of a couple slow moves by black.]

(;B[ed]C[bkamins: now it is probably too late.

HWC: With such thickness, maybe it's best to start with the edge of the moyo first. See var.]

;W[ab];B[ca]C[bkamins: After this the group is not alive yet and white can seal me in. Maybe running with E14 better?]
;W[ee];B[ij]C[bkamins: This was probably too deep, but white had huge lead now. I don't know what would be better.

HWC: This seems perfectly reasonable, as you can go either to the side or down. I don't think that white is actually that far ahead, since you had the sente to play this key point. Maybe j9 is better? Hard to say for sure. There will probably be mutual reduction, so it's sort of hard to count.]
