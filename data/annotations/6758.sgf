C[Hello,

thanks for reviewing this game!! ^-^
I'm very happy with winning it, because I was quite behind during the opening and middle game but catched up towards the endgame. I'd like to know if you can give some recommendations or hints about the general direction of playing - both mine and my opponents. What was good, what was accetable and what was completely wrong.

Thanks in advance!

Niko


R: Hi, I commented throughout. At your level, there are certain things that are easy to master and that will give you several stones improvement. The one thing that stands out of this game is: avoid making unnecessary forcing moves! if you watch dans play, you see way fewer of these. Everytime you make a bad forcing move, you lose many things, but most of all,  your liberties. If you just practice avoiding such moves, your level will improve tremendously. And it's not hard to do!

Hope this helps.

(;B[fo]C[This jump is suspect, since Q4 is white it's better to take c3 (see variation)]
;W[dn]
(;B[dr]C[R: This move is better omitted, because later you might want to jump to the corner. . See the normal joseki variation at move 18.]
;W[cr]C[is this ok?

R: The better  move is c3 here. Black can punish c2 by playing c3.]
;B[er]
(;W[kq]C[R: C3 is much much bigger: now C2-D2 exchange becomes very bad for white. White needs to finish at C3 before anything else! Otherwise why go c2??]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[bq]C[from my view black came out well here - what do you think?

This is a huge loss for white: black is competely safe and got a big corner too. White got very little in return. Now black is well ahead.]
;W[ic]C[proper invasion?

R: Not bad.  You can also consider a probe at d18 first.]
(;B[kc]C[right direction? i wanted to avoid white eating up my right side upper moyo - since my right side group is quite low...

R: hard to choose. G17 also fine.];W[fc];B[dl]C[too aggressive? seemed like a weak spot...

R: I'd say this is premature. Take the big points first. 

 Right now, black is winning alot because of c3 mistake. So you can consider playing safe moves such as c12 instead. Also R3 is very big sente move at the  moment.]

(;B[fj]C[any recomondations? 

You can also consider E11 instead... it seems to work.];W[if]
C[how about this white move?

Seems alittle loose. J15 is better if the aim is to protect  j17.]
;B[gk]C[This is good move.];W[il];B[qn]C[a good time to attack the corner? or better play 3x3 ?

R: I prefer R3. But would have been better to play R3 before invasion at D8. Now R3 is more problematic. You can also consider H16 now.]

(;W[ih]C[black should be dead in the corner, right?

Ko actually, see var.];B[oj]C[where to play else?

again, start with h16.];W[og];B[oo];W[op]C[black is still ahead but now white has a chance.]

(;B[pi]C[R: This is a typical "xmas present" move. It just gives white territory for free while making black heavier.Instead, consider several variations shown. Please practice avoding moves such as this... see some variations shown.]

(;W[om]C[R: Again, this forcing move is very bad; it reduces white's liberties but gains nothing. See var.]
;B[pm];W[ok];B[nk]C[ouch! black got lucky here...];W[pk];B[ol]
;W[po]C[Again, if you practice to avoid moves such as these, your strength will improve by at least 2 stones.]
;B[pn]C[R: sTaking at n8 is better; the point is that you will need to take it eventually anyway, so why not do it right now, and get all the liberties for free! This also shows that q5 is one of those bad forcing moves.]
