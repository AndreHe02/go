Hello there, i kept the lead the first 100 moves but lost there an important fight.
I just do not know which moves where wrong, or how to get the most out of that situation.
I also added some points at some points.
If I made some really stupid moves somewhere else, I would be glad to know about them.
Thank you!

[J\] Hi, my name is Jamie. I hope my comments are helpful.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[gq]LB[pn:A][jq:B]C[[J\] This leaves you with weaknesses at A and around B. A is the normal response.]
;W[cf]LB[pn:A]C[[J\] Normally white would take profit in a handicap game. I feel you were let off the hook a bit when white missed playing at A.]
;B[qq]LB[pj:B][pn:A]C[[J\] Still A, it also has the benefit of working better with B.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[fc];B[ee]C[Is there a better move in thes situation?

[J\] This is fine.];W[cc]LB[dc:B][cd:A][dj:C]C[[J\] Responding at A is best I think. B is another possibility but I think A works better with your other stone at C.]

(;B[pm]LB[cd:C][pn:B][qq:A]C[[J\] If A had been at B you would not have felt the need to do this. Even so, I still think this should be at C.]
;W[lo];B[cn]LB[jp:A]C[[J\] I think you should respond to this at A. Leaving this lets white settle the weak group in sente.]
;W[cm]C[[J\] Though white also leaves unfinished business. This white play actually helps you, forcing you to settle the corner.]
;B[bn];W[dl];B[lc]LB[jp:A]C[[J\] A is still important.];W[ne]

(;B[oc]LB[ic:A][lc:B]C[Would J17 be better?

[J\] Yes. You need to avoid creating another weak group here. A, connected with B, gives your group a base on the side.]
;W[jc];B[mc]LB[qc:A]C[Now I would play O 18 instead.

[J\] Yes, removes the potential for white to do so much harm by playing A.]
;W[nb];B[bl]C[[J\] An effective attack on the two white stones. You've attacked by stealing their potential for a base which is good.]
;W[dn];B[cp];W[in];B[jp];W[kp];B[kq];W[jq];B[iq];W[jr];B[ip]
;W[md];B[kd]LB[lc:B][dd:A][pd:C]C[Is it a mistake to try to save M17 and N 17?

[J\] A and B groups are both weak as a result of earlier choices. As it turns out in the game (3 moves on) it becomes clear that saving B results in C becoming weak, so yes, saving M17 / N17 is a problem.

A difficult game for you from here.];W[jd];B[ke];W[qh]C[[J\] I think this is an overplay by white but one that you will have trouble punishing, white being the stronger player.]
;B[og];W[qc];B[cd]LB[qd:A][qh:B]C[[J\] Something like A is urgent, otherwise B can come back to life for white. Going back to fix up earlier omissions is hurting.]

;B[qm];W[pl];B[ol]LB[rj:A][no:B]C[Is this move necessary?
Right no I do not know what is most important?

[J\] There is some value to keeping A and B groups split, however you need to be thinking about attacking the A and B groups after to make this worth while.]
;W[qd];B[hf]TR[oc][pd][qf][og][pj][pk]C[[J\] The marked stones are very thin. Moving off to play elsewhere is certain to result in at least something of a loss for you here.]

;W[om];B[on];W[nm];B[oo];W[jo];B[or];W[nr]TR[jq][jr]C[[J\] This play has the potential to connect to the marked stones, a bit unpleasant for you if that happens.]

Was I too greedy before or where did I made a mistake?

[J\] Yes, much earlier, move 108 I think. The white group got enough liberties for this cut to work some time ago.]
