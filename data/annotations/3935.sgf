C[Comments by Niall (2k* on igs) are indicated
"NM".

I'm going to try to provide some logic as to why I did certain moves, and some questions as to others. It might be best to ignore them, as they are mainly comments to myself. I'm more interested in your logic, after all. : ) I fell behind quite a bit in the middle game, and the only reason I managed to pull it up to 2 and a half points is because I was lucky. Granted, with komi I would have won, but that's not what matters to me. I need to fix the bad logic, or it'll happen again.

Here goes...];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[The Low chinese opening. I usually use the N4 approach now, but recently have been looking at some pro games that used O17. I wanted to try it : )

NM: I usually play )17 too ...];W[nc];B[pf];W[kd]C[NM: I would play one to the L, K16, because
that coordinates better with the hoshi
stone. Also this way if B plays P17 you
more or less have to reply O16, and you're
a little overconcentrated.];B[jp];W[hq]C[Maybe D10 would be a better choice? At this point I think it's maybe just a matter of style as W can play M4 now if b invades.

NM: These are difficult questions. No doubt
that D10 or C10 are good moves. On the
lower side I prefer H4 to H3, but this is
also very much a matter of taste or style.];B[ho];W[fp]C[NM: This is one of the reasons I perfer H4.
While F4 is sound, it feels a bit over
-concentrated. But it's hard to see how to
avoid this if you reply at all. Maybe G4?];B[cj];W[cg]C[NM: Good]
;B[cm];W[em]C[I like this move...keep black seperated and gain access to the center. Also...if B gets too big in the lower right, W can press the H5 stone.

NM: Difficult. I think that I would have gone for C5, since a B slide to B4 is big and
nearly sente. But  this move has a lot going for it too, just that you're short on
territory.];B[bp];W[cq];B[mp]C[NM: I don't like that B move. I would have
played somewhere around L10.];W[po]C[This seemed good for me, as if I get a chance later on I can slide underneith with K2. Right now I'm worried about B getting any bigger. Time to carve up the moyo, as they say.

NM: Indeed! And K2 is not your only resource
on the lower side - think of things like N3
or M4, or J4,K3 ... It's always difficult to
know where to enter a moyo, but I think I
would have made a reducing move first, maybe
at P9. Still, this is fine.];B[op]C[This feels like a bad move by black. If black had responded differently, would Q5 have turned out to be a bad move? This is one of my many questions.

NM: Q5 was fine. I think B's reply could
have been harder, such as Q4 or R7. But this
is OK too. Now a B play on J3 would give him
20 points on the lower side.];W[ok]C[I didn't want black to get this point if I tried R7 instead. I suppose I was also willing to sacrafice S5 if need be to carve up the S12 area. I was trying to play light. Good idea, bad idea? How else could I do it?

NM: R7 would have been bad, letting yourself
get confined and not even sure of life.
This is OK, but you have to be ready to cope with B replies like Q7 or R7.]
;B[pi];W[pl]C[NM: Could probably have been R8, but this is OK.]
;B[ql];W[qm];B[rm];W[pm]C[Seems like the only shape move to me now...though, I wonder how P6 would turn out? I can't seem to find a nice sabaki sequence.

NM: Not easy to get sabaki, no. I might
have played R6, but then B might well 
attack at P7. P6 I don't fancy, because B instantly plays R6. This looks good.]
;B[nm]C[Was black smart to play this move? I would play S6 without doubts.

NM: So would I, but B is trying to keep up the attack. And this expands his lower side.]
;W[nl]C[NM: Now I've made you reply, as B I would 
certainly play S6 or S5.];B[mm];W[jr]C[NM: I don't like this move. It's too territorial: a B reply at say J17 or D17 and
you're going to have difficulty getting
any large territory to match his R side.];B[kq]C[NM: But B responds, so your move becomes a good one.]
;W[rn]C[NM: Good; it threatens to stabilise the weak
W group.];B[rl];W[oh]C[I wonder if this was a good move...

NM: I don't think so. It doesn't really do much for the W group below, and it reinforces
the B side. And he could have answered P11, even nastier.];B[ph]
;W[qc]C[Here is the biggest dillema in my game. I was comparing this corner and E17 for a while...but after my attempt to count out territory after each result...I found that both are pretty much the same...maybe even that white has a lead in territory! My conclusion is that both R17 and the E17 area are miai.

NM: I think in territory E17 is bigger,
since it also reinforces the upper side.
But I think I would have played something
like L12, which threatens to make a big moyo
in the centre if B invades your corner, and
helps the weak W group];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb]
;B[eb];W[cc]C[I wanted to keep things simple. Plus...I don't know any other way to handle this one : )

NM: The joseki answers are D18, D17, and E17.
This is a bit slack, but not seriously bad.];B[ic];W[jc]C[was this a bad move? It makes the black group stronger...but what else could be done? L18?

NM: You don't need reinforcement on that side
- you group is already alive. I would have played G18, but if that's too agressive for
you you could play F17 or G17. Either would
build up your territory while squashing B to the edge of the board. Your move is a big endgame move, but it's too soon.]
;B[id];W[ib];B[hb];W[jb];B[fd];W[db];B[ec];W[ha]C[NM: Your last 4 moves have been good endgame
moves, but not yet. They are also aji-keshi.];B[gb];W[bn]C[Did I rush this? It seems pretty big to me.

NM: It's big all right. I would have gone out into the centre, maybe at L9 or even Q10, P11. But this move is certainly more urgent
than your last 5 moves.];B[cn];W[bo];B[co];W[cp];B[bm];W[bq]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[lk];W[pj]C[NM: Once you're replied at N9 you must
continue at N10. These moves are not big,
but they are necessary to secure the life of
the group.];B[qj];W[oi]C[Seems both this move and N10 are kind of hopeless. Going for solid influence in this area is a waste of time. Still...now that I think about it, the N10 shape looks better. O10 is a big weak spot here anyway.]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[nk];W[hm]C[This whole thing is not pretty. After I played this move I realized that black could play Q9 and cause some pretty big problems.

NM: Yes, you shouldn't have gone for the ko - 
it doesn't really gain you anything.];B[en];W[fn];B[ol]C[I was lucky...sorta.

NM: You were.];W[pk];B[eo];W[fo];B[el];W[hn]C[NM: This is big, but it's more urgent to
play N11, N12.];B[ni];W[oj];B[og];W[nh];B[mi];W[qp];B[qq];W[rq]
;B[rr];W[sp];B[qg]C[Free move by black...thanks black : )

NM: Yes, I think so. I don't see any way
you could exploit that weakness.];W[kr]C[NM: If you're going to make a purely territorial move on the lower side, M2 gains
you more. But I would have played T2, which
is nearly as big in territory if not answered
and helps your eye space.
However my first choice would be N13.];B[sr];W[on];B[mg];W[sn]
;B[fm];W[mr]C[NM: This is big, but I think E13 is bigger
- and resolves any lingering aji. (Think
about an attack at C15, for example.)];B[hk];W[ff]C[This move was horrible! A simple misread that cost me so many points. But really...what else could I have done? White has alot of influence to contend with. E14 looks like the only safe move...or maybe E13?

NM: My choice is E13, though F13 is also
possible. But even with this it needn't cost you much.];B[ee]
;W[ef]C[NM: Should be D14.];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[dh]C[NM: Bad. He should just have continued D13.]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[kg];B[ch];W[fg];B[eh];W[jf];B[hf]C[Black is ahead too far now for much to matter, in my opinion.

NM: I disagree. W is ahead in fixed territory.
(TL 13; BL 28; TR 16; BR 4 - total 61.
B has L 16, R 20, bottom 10, top 8 - total
54. You can't yet count the 3 W stones as
securely dead, but even with them that only
gives B 64.)  However
the difficulty is B's superior influence,
which threatens to make points round G12 and
round L6. B has the advantage. But it's
still worth fighting.];W[hg];B[ig];W[if];B[gg]
(;W[hh]C[NM: I think you can either save the three 
stones - which are big enough to be worth 
saving - or at least make a ko to save them, 
by exploiting the sente of F15. See the 
variations. However that then gives B a lot of territory round G10. Perhaps the best way
would have been to reduce that before you 
started this sequence, with something like H10.];B[gf];W[ih]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[mc]
(;W[md]C[NM: I think you can reply with O16, followed
by the hane underneath if he comes out. And you're strong enough on both sides to capture
if he tries M17. See the variation. But this
works out OK in the end.];B[nd];W[nb];B[ld];W[me];B[le];W[lc]
;B[ne];W[mb];B[mf];W[ke]C[NM: Good];B[lf];W[ko]C[NM: Good. But I think I would have played P2 first - he's not likely not to answer.]
;B[kp];W[he];B[gh];W[hj];B[ge];W[ie];B[gk];W[gi];B[fi];W[lo]
;B[mq];W[ik]C[I have my eyes set on the M13 cut.

NM: good luck to you! It looks pretty 
improbable to me - but improbable things do happen in Go.];B[hp]

NM: Yes, he has this and M10 as miai, so he could have saved the K6 stones.]
