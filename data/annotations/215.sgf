;B[gg];W[fe];B[dd]C[This is too far from the G7 stone. E6 would be better.]
;W[ef];B[ge];W[fc];B[fd]C[This is ok. It hurts the D6 stone somewhat, but letting White  push through G6 would be bad.]
;W[ed];B[gd];W[ec]C[The problem now is that  White threatens to take the entire upper left corner and leave Black pushed  down to the third line on the right side. Preferably, Black should bring D6  to life, but that seems to be very hard even before this exchange.]

(;B[de]C[Answering White's  atari at C6 is gote. There's a much bigger move on the lower side. (See  variation.)]
;W[ce];B[fe];W[dh];B[eg];W[ch];B[fb]C[An important move. If  White gets to play G8 first it's game over.]
