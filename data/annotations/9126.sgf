C[Go2where [12k\]: Hi
uandi2 [12k\]: hi

M: Hi Go2where, I will be reviewing your game and will review both sides. I will, however not comment much on opening moves as I feel like I do not have sufficient knowledge to say "one move is right over the other". Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review your game :)]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[op];W[qf];B[qh];W[nc];B[pf];W[qc]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rf];B[nd]
(;W[md]C[M: I am not sure that this move is very strong. Black has a very very solid structure in the top right corner, and for white to make contact with a weak shape will not benefit white, he may have to pay, if not now, eventually! please see the sequence.]

(;B[ne];W[mc];B[jd]C[M: This does not look good for white, he must try to run to the center with those 3 stones since he does not have eyes or a real base. Even if white escapes, he will pay if black can successfully exert his influence from his strong shape at the top.]
;W[gc]C[M: This may be a questionable move considering blacks position.]
;B[kc]C[M: Blacks move here is a little scared. Whether it is necessary, and even if it is sufficient to contain white is not clear (probably not). Still white has lost his base and perhaps this makes the decision for white to easily discard his three stones.

The idea of Go is to invest your stones as efficiently as possible. Blacks shape up top is strong, but at this point he has used too many stones to secure an amount of the territory that is not up to the price he paid. Further more white can easily extend at N15 and give black a headache if he does not have adequate influence in the center.]
;W[cf];B[qk];W[pb]C[M: This is a late game move, and I am not sure how much it adds. Albeit, if black chooses to respond he loses a lot, but there is plently of unclaimed territory on the right and bottom. Those points are HUGE. However, if lack chooses to ignore, then many of his beginning moves were for naught.]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[lq]C[M: This is a tough move to assess since there are many interpretations on what may be a good approach. However, I will point out that blacks stones at P4 and R4 connected with R9 are very solid in pposition. He would only have to play at M5 to build a huge moyo. This also gives him the opportunity to invade at F3 area or C9 area with out much worrying. See the variation.]

(;B[jp]C[M: Try considering breaking the pincer next time. His pincer is very loose, so you can escape easily. The moyo at the bottom right is just TOO big.]

(;W[gq];B[lp];W[jq];B[kq];W[kr];B[kp];W[iq];B[lr];W[jr];B[mq]
C[M: Compared the variation I proposed, this result is just too good for black. His moyo in mostly the center of the board is huge. His option to invade at C9 is also very good.]
;W[di];B[cn]
(;W[cp]C[M: This move is a very conditional one. I think you would better serve yourself if you played this only on rare occaisions, those being when protecting the corner is your only option. Next time I suggest doing a pincer, because as of now you're losing the battle with regards to center influence. You have to ask yourself, do you need to sacrifice more central influence at the expense of securing more corner territory? See variation on this movie.]
;B[en];W[om]C[M: This invade is VERY VERY deep, and is very scary. I think this runs the risk of handing black the game or relying on black mistakes to somehow come ontop.]
;B[mm];W[ok];B[oi];W[mk]C[M: black O8 would have been better.]

(;B[nj];W[nk];B[me];W[kk];B[ll];W[lk];B[cj]C[M: I don't like these moves, unless in certain conditions, obviously black is trying to improve his position here, but does so at the expesnse of also stregthening white. A better approac would be G6 or C9 or even D9. Making contact in a weak state is questionable]
;W[ci];B[dj]
(;W[li]C[M: Here is a rule. When jumping from a base of stones you generally want to jump N spaces. In this case you have 3 stones for a base so you would jump 3 spaces. Scared of jumping? then jump 2 spaces, but in this case jumping 1 space is too slow! see variation.]
;B[mh];W[ik];B[fj];W[fh];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[cd]
;B[bd];W[be];B[ac]C[M: why continue to play this sequence? Black is already alive, you should keep these moves unplayed, because you never know when you need good KO moves ;)]
;W[bb];B[ba];W[ab];B[da];W[ae];B[bc]
(;W[gi]C[M: This move a a little slow and doesn't seem to accomplish what white is trying to do. A better move is at H11]
;B[ge]C[M: This move hurts! Had white done a counter move before this it would have been much more in favor for white.]
;W[fe];B[gd];W[fd];B[hc];W[gb];B[hb]C[M: This result is painful, not only does black come out with a strong wall at the top, but whites potential territory was significantly reduced. That's the price we pay for slow inefficient moves.]
;W[kg];B[bj];W[bi];B[bo];W[bp];B[fo];W[jm];B[io]C[M: Blacks move here shows no purpose. White is free to move anywhere and exploits blacks position it is a vital opportunity. Perhaps F8 is a good point or R7 much more devastating.]

(;W[gl]C[M: if you had invaded 1 more stone deeper that would have ben devastating for black.]
;B[fl];W[ke];B[kd];W[ie]C[M: this was an error on blacks part. his moves are mindlessly following the sequence white wants him to play and white came out with a VERY favorable result. Good job white :)]
;B[id];W[he];B[hd];W[gf];B[je];W[jf]C[M: ouch this is just too good for white!]

;B[lh];W[kh];B[le];W[lf];B[fq];W[fp];B[ep];W[eq];B[gp];W[fr]
;B[fp];W[er];B[hq];W[hr];B[gr];W[gs];B[gq]C[M: This is not a good result for white. It was better to have just invested 1 more move at F3than to allow black to invade like this.]
;W[qn]C[M: good invasion.];B[ro];W[ql];B[hl];W[rh]C[M: Big point.]

C[M: this move does nothing for black. Take this opportunity to play sente moves at H19 and P19. This is easily a 8 point sing in your favor.]
;W[rg];B[mi];W[lj];B[co];W[km];B[lm];W[hm];B[im]C[M: better to have connected at H9, this would have been an approximately 5 point swing.]

uandi2 [11k\]: thx

Go2where: Great game! I know my comments were very critical, but I only do so so that you can improve! Many of the things I said were on details but if I were to impart to you 3 important points that you can keep with you for the rest of your Go journey is: (1) Don't be afraid to trade the corner for central influence (2) don't play slower inefficient moves (3) don't let your opponents dictate what moves YOU play. Go2where should play where Go2where wants!

Again, thanks for letting me review this game, it was a lot of fun :)]

(;B[me])
(;B[dr];W[me];B[mf];W[ke]C[M: I ignored Blacks D2. It's a lot of territory lost, but this is similar to black potentially ignoring white P18. However, what I gained is much more interesting. Blacks 2 stones at the top middle look lonely and whites position at L15 is scary for black.]
