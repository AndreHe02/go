(;W[hc]LB[kc:A][dj:B]C[This move is not good. It leaves far too much aji to be efficient. Locally W should play A, but it is imperative to play B to grab the last big point.]
;B[cj]C[riverstone: was the upper left corner more urgent, and if, what are the reasons for such a decision? My reasons for not playing in the corner were:
- if i get the corner territory, white gets outside influence and this would be too harmonic whith the lower left hoshi
- i thought that on the edge with 2 directions to descend it would be more easily to take sente somehow

deft: this move is good, invading the upper and lower left corners on san-san can be seen as miai.]
;W[ch];B[cm];W[cc]C[riverstone: the corner looks big now, so i wonder if i didn't offer to much secure territory to white for my little foothold on the edge.

deft: C7 could also be played at C6 to make it harder for W to tenuki, but now that he did tenuki I would play more severely in the lower left and double approach him. This will also attack the K4 stone, so I think it is hard for W to handle.]

(;B[bp]C[deft: this is too soft.];W[fq]C[riverstone: at least i got sente, but is the next play really the biggest?]

;W[nk];B[pm];W[pn]C[this looks heavy.];B[om];W[no];B[ml]C[B should be very happy to take this point.]
;W[lo];B[lm]C[riverstone: this is a move i was proud of during the game, because
- it treatens a cut at N6
- it forstalls a white cut around O8
- a white stone there would be good form

but normally the moves i am proud of are not very strong and my thinking tends to be too complicated, so feel free to tell me that all the above reasons are simply bullshit. ;-)]

(;B[md]C[W is low on the top so you are not really reducing his territory much by starting operations there, and neither are you expanding your own moyou. See if you can guess which other move I suggest.]

;B[ph]TR[pj][nk][ok][ol]C[riverstone: too greedy? i felt a bit uneasy about a white stone there and got a feeling that all my attempt to build a big moyo in this place where a kind of overplay. Now i felt safe and trapping the 4 stones should give me about 50 points on the right. Plus 22 on the bottom and 12 on the left, i was sure to maintaine the balance to whites 40-points corner.

deft: greedy? I think you mean timid -- after all you are killing stones which are already dead. But I agree with your analysis, so I think it is a good move since it is securing your win.]

(;B[bn]C[did you consider to fight with W? I think it is a shame to let him settle his big group so easily...]
;W[bq];B[ao];W[cr]C[riverstone: suddenly there are only 6 points left there. :-(]

(;B[gr]LB[bh:B][bi:C][gr:A]C[riverstone: bigger than B or C?

deft: You start the endgame too early. There are still interesting points in the center. Also, there are endgame moves far bigger than this.

At this point it is hard to imagine how W finally managed to build 20pt in the center considering he is thin and you are relatively thick.]

;B[mk];W[km]LB[in:A]C[W not only enlarged his territory and reduced yours, but also fixed his bad aji at A, so this is in effect a 15pt reverse sente sequence. The game is suddenly close.]

;W[jn]C[riverstone: seeing this, i resigned.
I guess i lost the game in the late yose, especially the loss of the 3 stones around D2 lost me the game. But i felt quite comfortable during the middle of the game and the fact that the game got as close in the end must be a hint, that i was strategically wrong with my comfortable feeling. But evan after playing again throu the game, its hard to see a main mistake. Please enlighten me in finding these deciding weakness of my play.

deft: You were quite right you had a comfortable lead, but you let this comfort sink in and so you let yourself be pushed around throughout the endgame. I think you lost easily 30pt in the endgame.
To me, G2 and B2 are the real losing moves of this game.

Thank you very much for the review. :-)
