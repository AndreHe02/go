C[Hello.

I'm Alexander, 2k on KGS playing as enk01 and i'll be reviewing your game for white.
I'll answer your questions to best of my abilities, but please take my advices and variations given with a grain of salt -- i'm as often incorrect with my views on go as any other 2k is :)]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[qo]LB[po:A][qo:B]C[You wanted to know if this move was a mistake.
In my opinion it is not. By statistics A is played a more often in this position, but B is certainly possible.

Both A and B prevent b from playing a Chinese opening. If this was your objective, you did well.

A makes it easier to move this stone into a center, B gives better possibilities for settling this stone locally.]
;B[po];W[pn];B[oo];W[cp]LB[qn:A][ep:B][fp:C]TR[pn][qo]C[You were also unsure about this move.

In my opinion this move is a mistake. Black can cut at A right away. White cant expect good result after this locally. Or black can approach at B or C developing bottom nicely.

All purpose of marked stones was to deny black a Chinese opening. Playing at C4 contradicts this idea.
And basically from a "common go sense" it's usually bad idea to leave joseki unfinished. One should have a really good reason to do this. Here, i think, you don't have one.]
(;B[qp]C[Too mild in my opinion];W[ro];B[rp];W[nd]LB[nc:A][qf:B]
[qn:C]C[This approach is bad.

Both globally and locally. Black should still cut at C. White spent two more moves there but is still weak.
B corner got even bigger for free.

Now you've decided to approach a corner.
First of all, generally, unless it's really complicated variation or some special situation locally -- some extra stones for example, the player who approaches a corner and plays out a joseki ends in gote. And black can even just ignore this.

This aside, high approach to 4-4 stone is generally an emergency measure, when you desperately need some stones there, to settle a weak group for example. So, on such an empty board, A or B are only feasible variations.

But you should still finish in lower right corner.]
(;B[pf]
(;W[qj]LB[nd:A]C[To see why A is bad, compare with variation given below.]
(;B[pi]LB[nc:B][qh:A]C[Black should play at A or B.];W[pj]LB[qi:A]
C[Wrong direction. A is better. White is settling his group while b loses points and base.]
;B[qi];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni];B[nh];W[mh]LB[oj:A][qn:B]TR[ni][oi]
[pj][qj][pn][qo][ro]C[Not good.

White marked stones are weak -- too many cutting points.]
(;B[mg];W[lh];B[lg];W[ld];B[ep];W[gp]TR[lg][mg]C["- move 28 approaching towards center and building moyo"

It's not doing any of this.
This tight pincer is making b run into center. And its rather hard too build moyo now with black marked stones looking into center.]
;B[en];W[cn];B[ip]LB[cq:A]C[usually black plays at A here, but i think this move is good, considering black thickness in lower right]
;W[gn];B[el];W[in];B[lp];W[jo]C[Not good. Doesn't help white shape, but black is making points for free -- so called "thank you move"]
;B[jp];W[ln];B[ko]LB[oj:C][nm:A][on:B][qn:D]C[Bad. Black can play at A or B. Combined with possible cuts at C and D b can expect good outcome in this fighting.]
;W[kn];B[io]C[Bad again.];W[jn];B[lo]C[Absolute gote];W[dj]
LB[cl:A][dq:B][eq:C]TR[lg][mg]SQ[ld][nd]C[Not good. if you want to attack this black group, just jump at A or play B or C.
This move is not building moyo, as black marked stones are poking in center, and white marked stones have no base and can be easily attacked.]
;B[ej]LB[cm:B][cq:A]C[Bad. Black should attach at A or B. This way black just helps white make territory on fourth line pushing from behing. Never push from behind.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[eh]C[Not good.];B[dk]C[Because of this. White two corner stones are now separated]

(;B[cm];W[bn];B[dn];W[dq];B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[gr];B[ir]LB[cc:B]
[jc:A]C[Not good. Black should approach top right corner or exchange A for whatever white replies and the come into a corner at B (such corner invasion will likely leave black with sente).]
;W[hq]LB[gc:B][pc:A][nm:C][on:D]C[Not good. Very small move. B can just ignore. White A, B, C or D are much bigger.]
(;B[iq]
(;W[qc]LB[pc:A]TR[ld][nd]C[Locally it's good move, But globally, it makes white marked stones weak. You shouldn't invade when you have weak (or not-so-strong group) nearby.
A is better in this case.];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[pb]

;B[kj];W[kk];B[fh];W[ii]LB[eg:A][jk:B]C[Not good. A is much bigger. you'd be getting territory by 5th line. That's great.
And locally B is proper defense. White have too mancy cutting points and need to play tightly.]

(;W[ij]LB[cd:B][fg:A]C[Not needed. White should cut at A or just play at B. Mind that without B corner is still open for invasion at C17.]
