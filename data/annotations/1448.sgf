C[phi: I like this game documented by a better player up to about move 100.  I (phi) am playing white and hope to learn something espacially in the opening.
I marked some questions out, but probably this are not the key moves...
Please give also comments to the black moves. I think, my oponent wants to learn something also.

;B[dd];W[pd];B[dp];W[pq];B[dj];W[qo]C[I'd directly approach one of B's corners, but this is only a personal choice

I feel reluctant allowing black to extend on k4 or k16];B[nc]
C[B should take K4 (or K3 ?)
That would be a perfect extension from his sanrensei, and also would keep W from extending there]
;W[lc]TR[pj][qj]LB[qc:B]C[You should play this only if you have a stone on one of the triangles q10 or r10

Trying a two-space high or low pincer may get you a better result, especially considering  black's stones on the left
Just imagine B plays on J17 now (see var)]
(;B[ne]LB[pc:C][qc:A][qd:B]C[phi: I have seen now in the joseki book, that it would have been better for black to play black A, white B, black C, to ensure life in the corner.

jean> BlackA, White ** C ** !! cause W doesn't have an extension on the right side
see variation];W[pf]C[phi: should I have played the 3x3 Point now to punish black?

jean> playing now at 3-3 would not punish black, but allow him to seal you in the corner]
;B[pb];W[qc];B[jc]
(;W[hc]LB[le:A]C[phi: I wondered, if A would have been a good move too: to weaken the black group.

jean> maybe, i think it leads to a fight, which is worth playing

easier way to play is L16 to keep black stones separated];B[je]
;W[ec]C[phi: now I am running for life.

jean> sure, but you have two weak groups floating
All this is because of your pincer at M17 (which looks lost now)]
;B[dc]
(;W[eb]LB[jb:A][jd:B]TR[hc][lc]C[phi: It is possible to connect the two marked white stones through A and B. Would it have been better?

;W[gd];B[if];W[fb]C[phi: still running for live.];B[hb];W[ib]
;B[ic];W[jb];B[hd];W[gb]C[phi: had to ensure 2 eyes.];B[kb]
;W[kc];B[ea]C[phi: now, the white group can not be killed any more. This move was useless.

jean> yes]
(;W[lb]C[this move is useless too
B stone can't escape];B[md]C[small move

bottom side is urgent move now
at k10 or k3

locking the left side is big too];W[pj]C[good, but better at k10 i think
(real extension from W corner then)];B[jp];W[lp]C[w has to get in B's sphere of influence
for example at c8];B[dq];W[ch]C[phi: greedy??

jean> no, but it is late ... W can't afford to let B take all the left side, so had to invade sooner]
;B[dg]C[phi: cant remember what I wanted to do with this move.
What would be better?

jean: maybe play at c14 (variation)]
(;W[cg];B[cf];W[cj]C[i'd plunge at b10 instead

harder for B to block it];B[ck];W[dh];B[bf];W[eg];B[df]
(;W[di]C[e13 is a wasted stone for the moment, since B can cut]
;B[ej]
(;W[ei]LB[bg:A]TR[cg][eg][ch][dh][di][ei][cj]C[phi: I think I should play something like A now, to ensure life for the marked stones? What would you have done?

A doesn't secure life (see var)
I'd play G12 or G11 to get out first];B[bj];W[gi];B[fj];W[fi]
;B[gj];W[ii];B[ij];W[hj]C[useless (you're just giving B to play on h9 and close his moyo)]
;B[hk];W[ji];B[jj];W[hq]C[Hyper risky move

Black can force ko for the life of your center group (var)

If your center group lives and makes some points in the process, you're ahead in the game
So, why not play l10 or so, to be really out and get a link to the right]

(;B[iq]C[W's mandatory move is now H3];W[fq]LB[kq:A]C[phi: too small for a base. Better give up the marked stone and press from the oposite (A)?

no just play h3 and wait for B's next move];B[hp];W[fo];B[gp]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[hn];B[jn];W[kj];B[kk];W[lj]C[as you'll see B L11 is painful

[hi][ii][ji][cj][hj]C[phi: I was thinking of A,B and C also. But I did not see a way to save the marked group.

A and C : k12 is deadly (see vars)
B: seems to lead to a ko, cause B can't play k12];B[jh];W[ih]
TR[cg][eg][ch][dh][ih][di][ei][fi][gi][hi][ii][ji][cj][hj]C[phi: the rest of the game was just a desaster. I tried to kill any black group to get marked group alive. But I lost.
