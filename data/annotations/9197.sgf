(;W[qn]C[DrK: This move feels a little indecisive. White stone C6 is by itself and need attention. I would suggest something a bit more aggressive to attack black's d14 stone.]

(;B[pl]MA[on]TR[qq]SQ[pj]C[Minjask [16k?\]: I suppose this is the first move that threw me. Your defense it pretty good.
alienman1 [18k\]: I'm just beginner, but I'm trying to learn as fast as it possible
Minjask [16k?\]: same


DrK: With black's so strong at top right corner, pincer is the expected move by black here. Personally, I thought Q8 is too high for black. Would prefer R8 instead. In any case, Pincer is a standard attack in go. Especially in handicap games one has to get used to it. Usually one has the following responses:

1. Escape to the centre. (Cross)
2. Evade/avoid its effect by playing lightly elsewhere. (eg triangle)
3. Counter pincer/trying to pincer back the opponent's pincer stone (eg square)
4. Try to live with smaller area of space with the pincer (which is what it would seem you were doing).

I will try to briefly explore all of those options here.]
(;W[rp];B[qq]
(;W[rq]C[Minjask [16k?\]: I think I entered combat to eagerly here
Minjask [16k?\]: too*
alienman1 [18k\]: I don't know, I'm not good in tactics




DrK: Especially in handicap go but also in general, it is not a good idea for a group to be boxed in. The critical move is p6.]
;B[rm]C[Minjask [16k?\]: well, this was nice. Felt a bit 'squeezy" if you know what I mean


DrK: Same as before, White P6 is necessary. White should avoid being boxed in if possible.]
;W[qm];B[ql];W[rn]C[Minjask [16k?\]: White looks manageable, but is confined, so I really have nowhere to run here]
;B[on];W[qp]C[DrK: This move is not effective if the aim is to for white to live. Instead R2 or S2.]
;B[pq];W[rl];B[rk];W[sm]C[alienman1 [18k\]: I was trying to overhelm you
Minjask [16k?\]: you did a decent job of it, I'd say. It was all I could do to survive.
Minjask [16k?\]: You might have succeeded too, if you'd defended the cut at S8
alienman1 [18k\]: hmm];B[hc];W[gb]TR[ck][dk][bp][cp][cq][en]
MA[dh][ch][kc][fe]C[DrK: This move does not really serve real purpose.

1. Attack - it does not really disconnect black's stone at H17 with top right corner.
2. Defend - white's top left corner is safe. So adding an extra stone does not really help with it having 2 eyes.
3. Development - the stone does not really expand into any empty area.



I would suggest marked moves instead:

Cross - moves that attack one of black's group by pincering or by disconnecting.
Triangle - moves that help defending/securing white's stone]
;B[gc];W[fc];B[fe]
(;W[cg]C[DrK: C6 is still by itself. Without a good reason it is important to avoid having a weak group.]

(;B[dg]C[DrK: I don't see why black should not simply cut the white stones here. D13 helps white securing the right side.]
;W[ch];B[cj]C[Minjask [16k?\]: That was a nice one. It really cut off my territory on the left



DrK: I don't like this move. White C14 is big to white. Black's C10 is attackable. White's C6 can run to the centre.]

(;W[ck]C[DrK: Without good reason it is usually bad for one to play a stone directly touching opponent's stone. Because opponent can respond by strengthening it.]
;B[di]C[alienman1 [18k\]: but you're good at life and dead
Minjask [16k?\]: That's cuz I was never taught the game. Everything I know i learned by playing tsumego
Minjask [16k?\]: this here was a good connection. i've got nothing I can do to cut it
alienman1 [18k\]: kosumi was a perfect move then i think



DrK: This move is a mistake by black. White can now connect the stones by playing at B10.]

(;W[bp]C[Minjask [16k?\]: I don't know the term kosumi yet XD
alienman1 [18k\]: it's move from C10 to D11
Minjask [16k?\]: ah
Minjask [16k?\]: yeah];B[cq];W[bq]C[Minjask [16k?\]: lol, this is a repeat of the right side




DrK: As before, E6 is more urgent.];B[co];W[bo];B[dm]C[Minjask [16k?\]: I'm guessing you were trying to keep my stones low, here?
alienman1 [18k\]: yeah
Minjask [16k?\]: it looks it. You've got the middle surrounded with a lot of stones, and I'm pressed against the side]
;W[do]C[alienman1 [18k\]: I saw I can't kill them, then it was best to keep them low
Minjask [16k?\]: yeah. I had hoped to try to eventually kill this group.
Minjask [16k?\]: I didn't have enough influence, though];B[cp]
;W[eo]C[DrK: D6 here white needs to connect the stones.];B[ep]

(;W[es]C[Minjask [16k?\]: I love this move. I saw it in a tsumego once, and love to try it. I think I might have played it at the wrong time, though
alienman1 [18k\]: i was shocked then
Minjask [16k?\]: it's called a monkey leap in english terms, and it only works because of the stone at B3. It's more for destructive purposes than building up




DrK: If white has a stone at B2 and black has no stone at c2 then monkey leap is possible. In here, black can simply play at B2 and disconnect.]

(;B[er];W[ds];B[dr];W[cs];B[cr];W[br]C[Minjask [16k?\]: it's hard to stop from connecting, but any further in and it could be cut off
alienman1 [18k\]: yeah, it was nice];B[dn];W[fo];B[cm]C[Minjask [16k?\]: I was surprised by this one. What was the thinking?
alienman1 [18k\]: I don't know, it was by intuicion
Minjask [16k?\]: it does little to attack as white simply connects at B6, although it does help to surround the stone at C9, but that's small points.
Minjask [16k?\]: The only merit I see is that it gains you sente]
;W[bn];B[bm]C[alienman1 [18k\]: it was good start to build that great wall on the left
Minjask [16k?\]: true. that got annoying];W[am];B[al];W[an]
;B[cl]C[Minjask [16k?\]: This was very nice. I had fully expected you to play B8
alienman1 [18k\]: c* was better I think
alienman1 [18k\]: c8
Minjask [16k?\]: yeah.];W[bk]C[Minjask [16k?\]: here I think I should have played A9 instead
Minjask [16k?\]: you would have responded with B8, and then I'd have played B9.
alienman1 [18k\]: it's better than triangle
alienman1 [18k\]: but I would try to escape if I were you
Minjask [16k?\]: I guess I figured I could reach around up towards the corner and keep the whole side]
;B[bl];W[bj];B[ci];W[bi];B[cf];W[bf];B[dk]
(;W[ah]C[DrK: Not a good way to secure white's group. Black can still play at B15.]

(;B[dh]
(;W[gq]C[Minjask [16k?\]: I really have no idea why I played this.
Minjask [16k?\]: I think I was trying to get some territory on the bottom
alienman1 [18k\]: then I was scared you'll kill me
Minjask [16k?\]: Yeah, I was also trying to kill






DrK: Right idea. But too aggressive.];B[fs]C[Minjask [16k?\]: this was good defense, though
Minjask [16k?\]: it gains you sente, where you can make precious eyes]
;W[bs];B[gr]C[Minjask [16k?\]: the group is now almost fully alive]
;W[hq];B[hr]C[Minjask [16k?\]: And now I'll never get in. the group is safe]

(;W[ir];B[is]C[Minjask [16k?\]: and now it's alive
alienman1 [18k\]: now yes

Edit: Upon closer inspection, I realized that white can potentially kill the group by playing at H1 instead of K1. Black would then have to extend at K1 to survive.



DrK: True h1 removes eye, but black does not need to live this way unfortunately.]

(;W[js];B[hs];W[jq];B[gp]C[Minjask [16k?\]: And the one move I didn't want you to play. I'd hoped to keep black contained so I could fight for the middle




DrK: It is not necessary to try to save the stones at F5.]
(;W[go];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[lq];B[in]C[Minjask [16k?\]: wanna discuss it?
alienman1 [18k\]: ok sure
alienman1 [18k\]: it was to surrond your group 4 stones on left
Minjask [16k?\]: ah
Minjask [16k?\]: that might have survived
alienman1 [18k\]: yes, but if I would play g8
Minjask [16k?\]: still, at this point you had the middle, and all I had was some scraps on the side
alienman1 [18k\]: it could be difficult
Minjask [16k?\]: I could use a few extensions to reach toward the middle. but yes, it would indeed be difficult
alienman1 [18k\]: that was my plan
Minjask [16k?\]: I plan to send this game in for review, would you like me to have them review yours as well?
alienman1 [18k\]: I could in easy way defend my stones at 4 line and atack your stones at 5 line
Minjask [16k?\]: that you could
Minjask [16k?\]: well, unless you had more to add. I should head off to dinner. Thank you very much for the game
alienman1 [18k\]: thank you too :)
alienman1 [18k\]: see you





DrK: Conclusion - White's issues that I had observed:

a. Don't know how to respond to pincer.
b. Leave weak groups unattended.
c. Getting boxed in.
d. Treating handicap games as if it is different from normal game.

For a. Just have to have more practice. 

Especially for b & c, I suggest checking out the folliowing page for further advice: 

For b: http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrategyForBeginners4Questions
For c: http://senseis.xmp.net/?ShutIn

For d, I suggest treating handicap games as the same as any normal game. Find open space to play when you can. Approach when all corners have been played. Try to anticipate and respond to pincer. And when able (after dealing with your weaknesses) attack!

Good luck in improving your games!

Cheers
