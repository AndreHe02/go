AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[benz9dan [16k\]: hi

SC: I will preface my comments with my initials.  Be sure to look at the variations I have added.]
;W[nq]C[glyn [21k?\]: hi]
(;B[kq]SQ[jp][jq][qo][qn]C[SC: You don't have to play close to your opponent's last move. Be sure to consider the whole board.  In a game where you are receiving a large handicap, you can focus on consolidating your already strong position.
See Variation.
Locally, this is reasonable response to white's move.  This is a rather tight pincer, so Black should be planning on a lot of fighting with this move.  If you don't want a lot of fighting, then one of the squares is better.]
;W[mp];B[ko];W[pr]
(;B[qq]SQ[oo]C[SC: You could also consider moving out towards the center.  This might make white run out into the center.  Black could then chase white while building a nice wall along the right side.
See Variation.];W[qn];B[pn]SQ[on]C[SC: This is a contact play, so this starts a contact fight.  Normally, a contact fight is not the way to kill anything.  Instead, a contact fight tends to allow both players to build up strength. Here, white's stone is weaker than the black stones in the area. So, a contact fight that strengthens both players will benefit white more.
If you want to pressure this white stone, play at the square. This isn't a contact play, so it won't tend to build up white. Playing at the square also helps black's corner stones avoid being surrounded.]
;W[qm];B[mn];W[qr];B[rr]SQ[fq][cn][qj][qf][nc][cf][fc][dj][jd]
C[SC: This is more of an end game move.  White wants to be sure of having enough eye space here.  Black can take Sente and play on a more important space.  Any of the squares would gain more for black than the current stone does.]
;W[pq];B[rp];W[lr];B[kr];W[lp];B[kp];W[lq];B[op]TR[oo]SQ[rr]
[rp][qq][pp]C[SC: This would be another good time to take Sente and play elsewhere. I doubt that black can kill this white group, and the white group is already cut off from the center pretty well, so black doesn't have much to gain by playing here.
This is a reasonable move if you are doing it to connect the marked stones to the rest of your near by stones.  If you are trying to connect, then I like the triangle better]
;W[mr];B[cn]C[SC: Good];W[fq]
(;B[eq]SQ[fo][dq]C[SC: This is another contact play.  Since white is weaker here, this will usually benefit white more.  Either of the squares is a better way to pressure white.
See both variations.];W[fp];B[fn]C[SC: This is a better way to contain white.]
;W[ho];B[go]SQ[jm][hm]C[SC: This move is only good if black plans to try to kill white. White's stones are rather weak here and don't have much room to make eyes, particularly given black's wall at L2-L5.  So, it is not unreasonable to try killing white here.  On the other hand, black is receiving a 5 stone handicap.  So, we have to assume that white is better at life and death than black.
So, this isn't really a bad move if black has a plan for how to kill white.  This move does not take advantage of black's strengths in this game (the handicap stones) so I would play one of the squares.
When receiving a large handicap, it is generally better to play calm, connecting sorts of moves.  If black can keep his stones connected into just 2-3 large groups, then he will probably win. Black should expect to lose most if not all life and death battles.]
;W[hp];B[hn];W[in];B[hm];W[jn];B[kn];W[jl]
(;B[gp]C[SC: What is the purpose or goal of this move?  If black wants to try to kill white, there are better options.  Otherwise, white still doesn't have eyes here, so black can keep driving white out into the center while building up black's position.
See variations.];W[hq];B[gq];W[gr]C[SC: When face with a position like this.  Black should first play on the side away from where he actually wants to cut.  Here, black would like to cut off and capture the two white stones at F3-4.  So, black should play at H2 first, then cut at F2.]

(;B[fr]C[SC: See variation.];W[er];B[hr];W[dq];B[gs];W[cq];B[ep]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[co];B[do]TR[io][dn]SQ[ep][dp]C[SC: This move makes an empty triangle (marked stones).  If you notice that you are about to make an empty triangle, stop and rethink your move.  Empty triangles are almost never the best move.  The only time they are a good idea is when you are making eyes.  Either of the triangles is a better place for black to play.]
;W[dr];B[cp]SQ[dj]C[SC: This move won't cut white, so it doesn't really do much. This move reduces white's territory by 1 point in Sente, but 1 point moves should be saved for late in the endgame.  Playing at the square starts to secure the area around C8 for black and is worth a lot more than 1 point.]
;W[bp];B[es]SQ[dn]C[SC: This is another endgame move.  Connecting at D6 is the best idea in this area.]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[dm];B[ds]C[SC:  Unless you have a plan to kill, this is an endgame move. I don't see a way to kill white, particularly since black has two weak stones at B6.]
;W[br];B[cl];W[cm];B[bl];W[bm];B[ek]TR[dn]SQ[cn][bn]C[Based on some variations I tried after the game, this does not seem a good move. Maybe C8 would have been better.

SC: Yes, Playing at D8 is better for black.  Look at the marked stones.  Black has two stones against a strong white group.  Then white cuts on the 4th line and the two black stones end up dead.  The same thing is about to happen again, unless black plays at D8 to prevent the cut.  Don't make the same mistake twice in one game.]

;B[ml];W[lj];B[nk];W[qj];B[qg];W[oi];B[og]
(;W[jc]C[I really didn't know how best to respond to this move. The upper right corner seems weak, but I also don't want the upper left corner attacking or white connecting up with the lower half of the board.

SC: A 3x3 point invasion would work in both of the upper corners at this point.  Black should be able to make a live group with territory in response to a white invasion, however.  
See variations.
Black can't protect both corners and the center at the same time. You have to pick one.  I would pick protecting the left upper corner.  First, blocking white out of the center isn't important. White has enough room to live on the side here and the white group around L9 is probably alive.  So, playing between these groups would be cutting apart two live goups.   Cutting two living groups doesn't accomplish much at all.  Of the two corners, black has more potential territory on the left.  Since neither corner is in danger of dying, you should try to secure the corner with the most territory.]

(;B[lc]C[SC: See variation.];W[gc];B[eb]SQ[ec]C[SC: The square protects the corner better.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[SC: Black should play R16.  Black has some potential territory around Q15.  Playing at R16 protects this territory and helps secure it.  Playing Q17 forces white to move into and destroy black's potential territory.  Go back and look at the 3x3 point invasion variation on move 83.  Compare how black ends up there to the current situation.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[pa];B[oa];W[rb];B[rd]SQ[nd]C[Should I have protected against the cut at P17 instead?

SC: yes, playing at the square is better.  Playing at S16 here is only good now if you think you can kill white.  Since I don't see a way to kill white, this is a small endgame move.  Plus, it is Gote.  So S16 should not be played now.]
;W[rc];B[se];W[oc]TR[ob][oa]C[Ouch! I played P16 in the game and gave up on the toip side. Maybe O17 would have been better?

SC: The two marked black stones are going to be captured no matter what black does.  So, you have to decide how to minimize the damage.  Playing P16 ends up connecting over to the black stone at M17 and securing some territory around P15.  This is better than what you get playing O17.]

(;B[od];W[nc];B[nd];W[nb];B[md];W[mi];B[mg];W[kh]
(;B[kg]C[SC: This helps secure a few points around M14, but the white stone at K17 will keep black from getting a lot of territory here.
See Variation.];W[jh];B[jf];W[hg];B[he]TR[jj]SQ[kd]C[SC: The square secures territory for black.  Also, black is forcing white to surround the black stone at K10.]

[ke][lg][ng][pg][sg][rg][no][sp][sr][qo][on][ks][en][gm][jo]
[al][ck][dh][ef][dc][ea]C[SC: This move starts some aggressive fighting.  Since white is weak here, aggressive is not a bad idea.  It is more important to be aggressive if you are losing.  If you are winning, then you don't need to play risky moves.
So, lets figure out who is ahead.  To do this, imagine the outlines of both player's groups after the gaps are filled in and count the points.  I have filled in the lines here to show what I mean. Imagine a black stone at each of the squares and a white stone at each of the triangles.
Now we count:
Black-
Top left corner 35 points
Bottom side 21 points
Bottom right corner 3 points
Top right side 15 points
Black total: 74 points
White-
Bottom left corner 13 points
Bottom right corner 7 points
Right side 11 points
Top right corner 11 points
Top side 4 points
White total: 46 points
So, black is ahead by about 30 points.  This means black should not do anything risky.  Instead, look for weaknesses in your groups and fix them so you don't lose what you have.]

;W[pf]C[SC: This is a bluff.  White can't do any damage in here.  White can't keep black from connecting at R12 so the black stones around S15 are safe.  White can't make eyes in here, but black can, so black will win any capture races.]

C[SC: White can't cut at D13.  Black may not be sure of this, however. Since we think black is ahead, it is OK to make moves like this to secure things.]
;W[lo]C[I overlooked the threat of M6 cutting off the lower right black groups and it seems white didn't notice it either for a while.

SC: Black should be able to make 2 eyes in the lower right corner if white cuts at M6]
;B[jp];W[jm];B[im]C[SC: This just fills a Dame point, it doesn't change the score. Don't play here until nothing else useful is left.]
;W[kl];B[mh]SQ[ki][oq][rs][ks]C[SC: This is another Dame point and doesn't change the score. Imagine white playing on this point instead of black and see if either of your territories changes.  If not, then it is a Dame point and shouldn't be played until after everything else is done.
The squares are all moves that will change the final score depending on who plays on them first.]
