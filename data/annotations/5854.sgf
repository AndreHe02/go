C[Hi Reviewer,

I took white in this game and although I took time for each move and in the beginning, somehow, the game looked pretty good for me, I couldn't seem to hold the advantage I built in the first half of the game.

I thank you for spending your time with this review :)];B[dp]

;B[de];W[fd]C[Since my original plan was to shimari at C15 to somehow work together with Q16 stone, I decided to follow this joseki]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd]
(;W[bb]LB[eb:A][ec:B][hc:C]C[This is also playable but makes a less stable group than a move at A would.
The reason that A is considered "more joseki" than W10 is in the possibilities B now has at A or B, to be prepared by C in some cases.]
;B[bc]LB[dh:A]C[Here I thought I was sort of lucky :) B17 is a just too slow at this stage of the game. (am I right?)

Yes, you are right. Besides being non-urgent, B17 makes bad shape (empty triangle). If W is in an ugly mood he can try to take away B's extension by playing around A now.]
;W[ic]C[A rather narrow extension but wise in view of the aji mentioned at W10.]
;B[ch]C[The outcome in the upper left is somewhat better for W: he has the corner!]
;W[op];B[lp]C[B 15 is a good move since the pincer is backed up by the stone in the lower left.]
;W[qo]C[Here I chose this joseki to avoid fighting again. but...

Strange motivation for your move! This outside attachment may lead to wild variations, such as the original "magic sword".]
;B[oq]C[I've never seen this before so I just read out the sequence following this. Somehow he moved just like I planned but i'm not sure if the result was equal.

B 17 is a strange move, to say the least. I did not find any hits in a pattern search on www.gobase.org (which indicates that professionals do not play like this). See  the variation for what I think is W's best reaction.]

(;W[pq];B[pp];W[nq];B[or];W[po];B[np];W[oo];B[qq];W[pr]C[Seems to be a free gift to B.]
;B[nr];W[qr];B[rr];W[rq];B[rp]C[See the variation where W gets a ko. Not that W can play this now (it's a two-step ko so you need quite a number of threats to make it effective) but it may be a useful bit of knowledge.]

(;W[ro];B[sq]C[In your comment at B17 you indicate that you calculated this outcome. That's quite a clever feat, but: this is not good for W!
B has a safe corner of about 16 pts, and good prospects on the lower side. The value of the W wall has still to be proven.]
;W[mo]C[Is this a good move? My first thought was that this one was not so good since it's aji-keshi. and black came out on top with strong position facing his corner stones + the corner.

Maybe I should just go straight to R10 or Q10?

Your move is indeed aji-keshi. Worse, it is misplaced since it leaves a hole at O5.]
;B[mp];W[qj]C[Very important.];B[nc]
(;W[lc]C[when black jumped in there, I didn't want him to live too comfortably so after I played M17, I regretted it almost immediately. maybe P17 then M17?

I like your move better than P17. See the variation at the previous move.
Seeing how wide your position is around Q16, I don't think there is any way you can deny B an easy life. But make it so that he lives in a way most advantageous to W!]
;B[qc]
(;W[pc]C[Chosing on which side to block can be very hard, as in this case. 
There are any number of theoretical arguments for that, but my advice to you would be: visualise the outcome for both blocking moves and chose the one you like best. 
See the variations for this W move and at W 44.];B[qd];W[pe]
;B[pb]
(;W[qe]C[Here I decided not to follow joseki because of my position on the right seemed right... Hopefully it was a correct decision.

It looks as if W is changing his opinion on the question of which side to block on. This is to be avoided unless you're absolutely sure that the original choice was wrong. 
I think this move is OK but W 40 should have been on the other side. Compare the result you get now with the variation given for move 40.]
;B[ob];W[re]C[I also regretted this one. Because I didn't feel like letting black live comfortably there so I thought I might be able to chase him out. But obviously this turned out to be a wasted move.

Maybe N15 would have been better?

In the game B is going to live locally, playing some low moves. So W should be happy about the result of W 46.]
;B[lb];W[kc];B[kb];W[jb];B[mc];W[me];B[oh]C[I was actually happy he jumped in. But I guess I tried too hard to capture it and it turned out all wrong.

B must go in or allow you a really large territory. But given the looseness of the W structure you should not expect to capture him. Chase him, keeping an eye on making W territory and destroying B's.

But B is probably slightly better here already: W has got a sub-optimal result in the lower and upper right, more than canceling B's error in the upper left.]
;W[ni]LB[oj:A]C[Slightly too close, better at A];B[ng];W[mf]
;B[mg];W[lh]LB[lg:A]C[I do not like this one, tell you why at the next move.
Should be at A.];B[lg]TR[mf][lh]C[Now it seems as if W has allowed B to cut right through his knight move (keima) consisting of the marked stones.]
;W[kh];B[oi]TR[ni][qj]C[And the large knight move relation between the triangled stones is also cut.]
;W[nj];B[pj];W[qi];B[kg];W[og];B[nh];W[of]C[So P13 was gote and accomplished nothing for W]
;B[jg]C[after this sequence, I thought P13 was a bad move, now black isn't really in danger anymore and my stones in the middle was floating.

Very well put.];W[eg]C[Here's my desparate attempt for a leaning attack.]
;B[jd];W[ke];B[je];W[cg];B[bg];W[cf];B[bf];W[ce];B[be];W[dd]
CR[kc][lc]TR[ce][cf][cg]C[This is probably the losing move? I think E14 is probably good enough.

In the next few moves, W is going to lose the triangle-marked stones as well as the circle-marked ones. The triangled ones you can afford to lose (in a leaning attack this happens more often than not) but the circled ones are essential in holding your position together.
So all moves except those that defend the cut at K17 will result in W losing the game.]
;B[dg];W[ee];B[ef];W[ff];B[df];W[eh]C[No time for this! Thank the gods that B has not yet cut K17 and defend there!]
;B[jh];W[kj];B[pk];W[ql];B[qk];W[rk];B[pl];W[qm];B[jc]C[Game over.]
;W[ib];B[ld]
(;W[kd]LB[kf:A]C[Another gift. Must be at A for W's last chance.]
;B[le];W[fq]C[after the disappointment on the chase I decided it's time to reduce black before he can utilise the thickness on both left and bottom.

Resigning the game would be appropiate here. It is instructive to count the position to convince yourself of this.]
;B[iq]LB[hq:A]C[Since B is so strong at the bottom, the 1-space pincer is better.]
;W[cq]C[probably a double approach is better?

With the 2-spaced low pincer B cannot stop W from going into the centre after W plays 3-3. So your choice is OK even though nothing can save your game now.]
;B[cp]C[B should block from the other side with this pincer.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[fr];B[bq];W[br]C[after the game I also regretted this move. I should have played G5 right away? or an invasion on the left?

I think your move is OK. B cannot keep you in anyway.
Going into the right side is more active, but B2 for B is a big sente move that you do not want to allow. And B is rock-solid in the upper left.]
;B[dk];W[dm];B[cm];W[cl];B[dl];W[cn];B[bm];W[bn]LB[dn:A]C[Should be at A.

This is the last comment*.
My advice to you is the same as my teacher once gave to me:
"Three things are most important in getting strong at Go: they are reading, reading and reading".
A fourth is drawing the right conclusions from what you have read (the lower right corner).
