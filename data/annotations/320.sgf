[pc];W[pp];B[ce];W[dp];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[pe];B[ph]C[NM: I wanted a wide pincer, to keep
an eye on the lower right.];W[qc]C[NM: Now my joseki book says that this
is bad, but I didn't manage to exploit
it properly.

EE: My joseki book also says this is bad!
I think you handle it correctly to start with, though.];B[qb];W[qd];B[ob]
;W[ne]MA[ph]LB[qg:A][of:B]C[EE: I guess your joseki book tells you that if the marked black stone were at 'a', White could get a fair result by playing #14 at 'b', making miai of playing at the top or pressing at the marked black stone. Here, the position of the black stone makes White's group heavier and harder to settle efficiently.]
;B[md]C[EE: I think this is good.];W[pj];B[nh]C[NM: Should I have made the diagonal
move here (P13) to be sure of
separating the two white groups?

EE: No, it is too slow and heavy. The jump looks most natural. White should not expect a good result by trying to connect the two groups.]
;W[nd];B[nc]LB[mc:A]C[EE: Did you consider playing at 'a' instead?];W[me]

(;B[ld]C[NM: Should this have been M15?

EE: Black shouldn't complain since he is being pushed along the fourth line. M15 could end up weakening Black's ikken-tobi below. (var.)]
;W[qh];B[qg]C[NM: It seemed to me that if I went
on the other side (R11) I'd strengthen
the top white group too much.

EE: This seems allright.];W[pg];B[qi];W[rh];B[og];W[pf];B[pi];W[ri];B[rj]
LB[qj:A]C[EE: This *must* be at 'a' instead, since White can cut. 'a' would extinguish the white stone on Q10 and Black's thickness would make the result in this corner clearly (5-8 points? :-) favourable for Black. (Though a stronger player might think differently...)]
;W[qj]C[EE: Now Black gets into trouble.];B[rk];W[rg];B[pl]C[NM: Was this too agressive?
Should I have gone P10 and allowed  him to take my 2 stones?

EE: The mistake is already done and whichever way Black plays it will be painful.
Maybe the fighting alternative suits your style better? :-)];W[oj];B[ni]
;W[ol]C[EE: Hmmm... strengthening Black.];B[pm];W[nj]LB[mk:A]C[EE: This makes White's prevoius move look purposeless - 'a' would have given it a meaning.]
;B[mj]C[EE: Black has two (potentially) weak groups on each side of the White group. In such a case, Black should try to take care of each group without hurting the other one, but leaning against the White group is likely to have such unwanted side effects.]
;W[jc]LB[li:A]C[NM: ... which broke the ladder, so I
defended.  Was that right?

EE: Yes, since your top right corner is safe, K17 is a single-purpose move. But the shape move to defend is 'a'.]
;B[lg];W[om];B[pn]C[NM: There was an option here of P6,   but it looked like a nasty fight if he cut.

EE: Yes it looks too risky.];W[mk];B[lj];W[on];B[po];W[oo];B[qp];W[qq]C
[EE: Who gets sente after this is a critical matter. Maybe White should try something else here, don't know what, though.]
;B[pq];W[op];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[pr];B[jp]C[NM: I had to invade the lower side,
and this looked like the best point,
with a view to exploiting the aji of Q3.

EE: Black is making use of his sente - good!];W[kq]LB[hp:A]C[EE: Strange! As a rule, a shoulder hit from below is rarlely good. and this is no exception. If the White stone had been there from the start, Black's last move would make a perfect reduction; thus, White is actually helping Black here.

White should probably play around 'a'.];B[hq]LB[kp:A]C[EE: I expected Black 'a'.]
;W[jq];B[ho];W[fo];B[hm]C[NM: Was this too solid?

EE: While playing in the opponent's sphere of influence, it is extra vital to make safe connections. So this move is good.

Overall, Black and White has about the same amout of safe territory, but since Black has the better prospects for development in the top left area, I feel the game favours Black. (So no need to try anything fancy.)]
;W[fm];B[dl];W[fk];B[kp];W[lp];B[lo]C[NM: Should I have cut him then with
J3?

EE: I don't think so, connecting on the second line is pretty small now.]

[nq];W[oq];B[mo]LB[nr:A]C[EE: My first recation was that Black's moves around N4 were just endgame (and thus too small), but since the big white group on the bottom right might need to look for eyes (a black move at 'a' could be a threat after some preparation) they might be of some strategical value.]
;W[kn];B[ko]C[NM: Or should I have gone M7?

EE: Possibly.];W[gn]C[EE: ??];B[ll];W[lk];B[kk];W[kl];B[ml]MA[kl]C[NM: The sacrifice was deliberate.

EE: It seems possible to cling to this pair of stones and capture the marked cutting stone (see variation for move #93). It would force White to look after his P6 group.]
;W[nk];B[jl];W[km]
(;B[jn];W[jk];B[kj];W[mm];B[jm];W[lm];B[ik]C[EE: Black gets gote, and there is still bad aji here (see var.). Further, the P6 group is completely safe now, so the sacrifice was no clear success for Black.   It still looks like a good game for Black, though.
I feel that from here on, Black's failure to make profit while attacking was the main reason he didn't get the win that the current position promises.]

(;W[cj];B[el];W[fl];B[dj]LB[ej:A]C[NM: Could I have attacked better?

EE: It is regrettable to lean on (=strengthen) the stone that you want to attack, but you can't allow White an easy connection with Wa. The only alternative I see is Ba, but it has the drawback of being cuttable, so maybe #103 is best after all...]
;W[di];B[ej];W[cg];B[dc];W[de]
(;B[dd]C[NM: Should I have ignored D15 to go,
say, G17?

EE: No, that would be worse! See the variations!];W[gc];B[ee]LB[cf:A][df:B]
[bg:C]C[EE: This could be the wrong direction. Does it take any profit while attacking? To make this a good move, you need to be able to *profitably* attack the group at the top for compensation.

I still think a-b-c is better. It takes profit and White can't connect his two groups with one move anyway.]
;W[df];B[fd]C[NM: Or F17?

EE: F18 or L18 (=profit).];W[je];B[le]C[EE: Only thickness! When he has a living gruop at the top, what can you do with the thickness then? Better to take the cash at the edge and let him connect on dame points.]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[lc];B[mc]C[EE: Might be omitted];W[fb]C[EE: It is very painful for Black to see White live this big here. Suddenly the game doesn't look so good for Black anymore.]
;B[fg]LB[ck:A][bf:B]C[EE: This is the wrong direction! There are no points to fetch in the center and you can't expect to kill the White group on the left.

You should think about moves like 'a' or 'b'.];W[bk]C[

 Niall 7k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[bf];W[bg];B[cq];W[dq];B[cr]C[NM: Should I have gone B8 now,
to try attacking the W group?

EE: Yes it could be a little bigger since it effects who gets sente moves against whom.]
;W[bm];B[cm];W[bn]C[NM: Did I have any worthwhile attack?  It didn't seem so to me.

EE: No.];B[bo];W[cl];B[en];W[eo];B[do];W[em];B[dm];W[cp];B[co];W[gp];B[hp]
LB[eb:A][jg:B][if:C][nr:D]C[EE: Only about six points in gote. 'a', 'b' (or maybe 'c') and 'd' are certainly bigger.]
;W[dr];B[hd];W[hc];B[fi]LB[br:A]C[EE: Because of White's next move, this seems to be the wrong direction to make territory in the center. Concerning the safety of the bottom left corner, Black can play  'a' to live, should the need arise.]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[id];B[he];W[ig];B[hg];W[jh];B[ii];W[nr]LB[pk:A][ql:B][mq:C]
C[NM: I had had my eye on O2 for some
while, but it seemed to me to be gote
once he had taken my M8 stones.

EE: Yes, note that 'a' (threatening 'b') should be White's sente, so he is perfectly safe. But O2 is still a big gote move, at least 8 points. Note also that White should play 'c' instead of #154.]
