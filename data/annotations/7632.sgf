C[Hello and thanks to whoever is reviewing this game.

It was a game I won during the mid-game due to my opponent's mistake. However, throughout the course of the game, there were many positions in where I thought what would be a better move, i.e. how would a stronger player play?

I would like the reviewer to answer these questions, and point out any obvious mistakes he sees, from either white's or black's perspective.

;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[qo];B[qm];W[oo]C[This seems playable to me. White's aiming at R9 area, and a subsequent approach on the top-right corner after this one is settled.]
;B[np]LB[pl:A][qq:B]C[>>I think A & B are your options here. You should focus on strengthening your group before making even more groups.]
;W[qk]C[>>The problem here is that you are in enemy territory, and instead of thinking "I have to make myself safe as quick as possible", you are confidently creating another group. Your P5 group isnt strong enough to attack with yet.]
;B[om]LB[rm:A][qq:B]C[A and B seem miai, but are they really? Could white play tenuki now? Pushing at O5 seems really crude.

>>This move hurt your R5 group. You definetely should not Tenuki since you have two weak groups here that are not yet connected. Your problems arise from having a lot of weaknesses in your shape.]
;W[qq]C[I chose R3 as a probe to see how my opponent would react.]

C[So I ended up playing both moves. Looking back, perhaps playing S7 straight would've been better, to leave the corner open for further plays?

>> You didnt really accomplish much with R3.You made black stronger and your group was still in trouble afterwards.]
;B[rl];W[ql];B[rn];W[pm];B[sm];W[qn];B[rk]LB[rj:A]
(;W[ol]LB[rj:B][ol:A]C[Would it be better to block at S10 and fight the ko? See variation.]
;B[qj];W[ri]C[>>I feel like this is ajikeshi. You should just play R14, and save this in case it is needed later.]
;B[rj];W[qf]C[So I got to approach the corner anyhow.];B[qi]
;W[rh];B[oj];W[nm];B[kq]C[Feels a bit slow. The shape in the bottom right seems settled, so perhaps black could've gone to F3 straight? Would white pincer?

>>F3 looks much better here, yes.];W[cf];B[cn]C[>>I think you must F3 here. The black thickness on the bottom right is just too scary to allow him to attack with.]
(;W[db];B[fq];W[eo];B[cq]LB[ic:B][of:A]C[Black's shape feels a bit sparse. H3/J3 is too far away.

>>There are several problems here. First off, your D4 group is now floating because you ignored the approach. Black will likely attack it, and gain a lot of point in the bottom of a result. Yes, black is think at the bottom, but during the attack on D4 black will strengthing himself (for example with moves like G5)

Another problem is that R14 is still weak. You should not go invading nearby. The move at A helps your group, and also has the added benefit of attacking the R10 group (and puts pressure on the top right)

Also, a move around B is big too. You built up all this strength in the top left but are not using it.]
;W[nc];B[nd];W[oc]C[Would there be a better move? Hane at N16 felt inadequate as then black would most likely block the corner and R14 might become under serious attack. Not that black R10 group is out of the woods either yet, though.

>> Once again you are attacking with a weak group. If you want to attack using strength, look at the top left. A pincer there would be very severe against black.]

(;B[pc]LB[pb:B][pc:A]C[It seems Q18 would've put much more pressure on white. See variation.

>> Yes, once again white is fighting with a weak group.];W[pb]
;B[mb];W[ob];B[jd];W[md]LB[mb:C][od:B][qi:A]C[>> I like this cut. You are strong in the area. Black has 3 weak groups (A,B,C). This move is how you should model your play: "Make a fist before you punch". This attack is different from your previous ones because you are strong in the area, and are now using that strength to attack.]

;B[ge];W[ee];B[ff];W[fd];B[hd];W[gd];B[ke];W[id]C[>>In general your reading seems good, but you play with a bit of what I will call "jealousy". You seem to need to invade everywhere to stop your opponent from making territory.

I would recommend you study and meditate on the idea of "Honte":

http://senseis.xmp.net/?Honte

This will bring great benefit to your game. The idea is to first strengthen your own groups, and then if your opponent does not do the same in the area, then you can exploit the fact that your groups are stronger and do something (attack, invade, etc).

I would recommend watching some dan-level games and trying to spot Honte moves. Try to understand why it is the proper move. Also, try to see if you can find what kind of threat is hidden behind the move as well.

Good luck to you!])
