C[I
played black in this game.  I'm a pretty weak player and made some
obvious big mistakes in this game.  I'm now trying to learn and
implement the concepts of shape and influence  into my game.   Also I'm
not for sure if I am following the direction of play.  Any way, here it
is.

---
[PL\] Hi,

I'm Peter and like you, I'm trying
to improve my game.  Even though I'm fairly new to GTL, I've already
met some great people who are walking the same path as you and me,
except they're just a bit further.

Long, long time ago, my
"teacher" was the kind who built large moyo (potential territories),
and who wasn't too strong at fighting.  To get really far, you need
both, of course.  I myself am currently trying to improve my fighting
(calculating).  But because you request it, I'll comment on the large
scale strategy.

My comments always start with [PL\].

Here's a short summary of the comments in the game.
1)
Your play is quite good in several respects.  You are quite capable of
building walls, and your use of them is okay.  Your opponent played
very agressively (several overplays), and you put him under pressure. 
That part of the game was very interesting to watch.  I didn't get the
impression you were intimidated.
2) The main mistakes are related to
cutting points.  You had 3 groups cut off.  All could've been avoided
if you kept a closer eye on cutting points.  A similar thing happened
in the centre, where you could've encircled a white group on a large
scale, but white managed to escape.  It's the same thing but the other
way round: finding the escape routes for the opponent.
3) I've added several comments on efficiency that I hope you'll find interesting.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dq];W[dd];B[co]TR[pp]C[[PL\] Combines very strongly with the triangled stone.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[jq]LB[kq:a]C[[PL\]
He's overextending a bit ('a' would have been normal), but this is much
too early to punish him for that.];B[gr];W[qq]C[[PL\] This is quite
agressive.  He's trying to take the corner AND the bottom side, while
his bottom is has the weak point at 'a'.  Normally, if he takes the
corner, his bottom group will become very weak and he will need to
defend.  That gives you the opportunity to play a big move.

Let's see what happened...];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[rr]
;B[oq];W[os];B[ns];W[ps];B[nr];W[mq]LB[po:a]TR[jq][mq][nq]C[[PL\]
Indeed, his bottom group (triangled) is weak, and he defends.  It is
still a nice target for attack for you.]
(;B[nn]C[[PL\] Very nice.  You defend the cut at 'a', and keep the pressure up.  I've put another idea in the variation.]
;W[no];B[oo];W[mo]
(;B[om]C[[PL\]
This is small.  Check the variation.];W[jo]C[[PL\] White is starting to
look okay: a bit of eye space, and possibilities enough to run away.]
;B[qf]TR[jq][mq][nq][no][mo][jo]C[[PL\] Good.  Just like what I said before, except for 2 things:
1) White's triangled group is now more difficult to attack
2)
This approach on the 3rd line is easier to pincer (which is indeed
White's next move).  But white can now afford a weak group, because the
triangled group is stronger.

This is the main difference between playing here now, and one move before: timing.]
;W[qh];B[of];W[qe];B[pe];W[oe];B[pf];W[qd];B[ne];W[od];B[nd]
TR[qh]C[[PL\]
Quite a good continuation for Black.  White now has to take care of the
triangled stone.  Again, White's position isn't so bad now, because if
his triangled stone lives, Black cannot make territory on the right
side.];W[qk];B[nh]TR[qk][qh]LB[fd:a]SQ[nh][ne][nd]C[[PL\] This is a
very good strategy: you're keeping pressure on the triangled stones. 
If he lives with a small group, you can play 'a' (for example) and use
the influence of your wall (squared stones) efficiently.

(Black's
wall isn't perfect yet, and 'a' by itself isn't safe, but the
combination puts pressure on white's D16 stone, and threatens to take
the top side as territory.  This is a double threat, so it's very
strong for black !)];W[rm];B[rn];W[rl];B[pj]C[[PL\] You're still working on the plan I outlined before...]
;W[qj];B[pi]MA[ok][ol][pl][pk]LB[rp:a]C[[PL\]
... but this is a bit dangerous, as white demonstrates.  The hole
around the XX-area is pretty big.  It's not a big problem to live (in
the game, you indeed had no problem), but it's nice to keep your stones
connected.];W[ph];B[oh];W[ol]C[[PL\] This is a nice strategic move by W.]
;B[nl];W[ok]
(;B[pk]C[[PL\] I've added a variation to this move.];W[pl];B[nk]
;W[oj];B[oi];W[nj];B[mj];W[mk];B[mi];W[ml];B[nm];W[lm]C[[PL\]
White has dramatically improved his position.  His group on the right
is alive, his bottom group now also radiates power.  Your wall isn't as
big as it could've been.];B[qm];W[ql];B[rp];W[rq];B[so];W[rs]
TR[mj][mi][nh][ne][nd]LB[gd:a]C[[PL\] Okay, the bottom right corner is now settled.  Time to use your strength (triangled group) and play around e.g. 'a'.

The go proverb says: first play urgent moves, then play big moves.

Making life were urgent moves.  Now that's done, grab the big ones !]
;B[qi]C[[PL\] End game !];W[ri];B[qg]C[[PL\] End game !  :-)]
;W[rg];B[rf]MA[sf][sg][se][re]C[[PL\]
Well, because of your previous move, it's big if white plays here: he
connects and grabs territory at XX.];W[rh]C[[PL\] White is now alive.]

(;B[sg]LB[sc:a]C[[PL\] Hm, threatening to kill him is a ko threat.

'a' looks very strong to me.  Do you know the big monkey jump ?  Check the variation.]
;W[sj];B[sm];W[sl];B[sn];W[sh];B[sf]LB[se:a][re:b][gd:c]C[[PL\]
Aw, this is a very small gote.  Suppose white takes this stone, you can
play 'a' and worst case it's a ko (white plays 'b' and threatens to
connect)

Around 'c' is still the most important & big point
on the board: if black plays there, he's using his wall.  If white
plays in that area, he destroys the influence of black's wall.]
;W[sd];B[nc];W[oc];B[ob];W[pb];B[nb];W[rb]
(;B[jd]C[[PL\] Right idea, but 'a' would've been more efficient.  I've added two variations.]
;W[lc]LB[gd:a][gc:b]C[[PL\] White has a severe attitude problem.  He doesn't want to give you any point of territory :-)]

(;B[ld]C[[PL\] A move around 'a' or 'b' would still be interesting.  Check the variations.]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[kd];B[ke];W[mf]LB[nf:a][le:b]C[[PL\]
As you remark afterwards, the cuts at 'a' and 'b' are quite dangerous. 
This white move threatens 'a' specifically.];B[me]TR[of][pf]
[pe][qf][qg][rf][sf][sg][kd][kc][lc]SQ[mj][mi][nh][oh][oi][pi]
[pj][pk][qi][mf]CR[ld][me][ne][nd][nc][nb][ob]C[[PL\] This is still quite strong for B.  White can have several plans:

1) cut at 'a' and try to capture the triangled group (or the triangled AND squared groups together)
2) Work as in the game & capture the circled group

But if black plays solidly, he will have a lot of problems with both his white triangled and squared groups.  No problem yet...]
;W[lf];B[jf]LB[le:a]TR[lf][mf]C[[PL\]
Here, you invite W to cut at 'a'.  You should only do this if you
calculated, and you are certain you can capture white's triangled
stones first !];W[le]
(;B[md]C[[PL\] Check the variation.  Even if white connects, it's not necessarily a problem !

In a situation like this, try the following next time:

1)
White tries a very agressive invasion (move 92).  Black has a lot of
strength around this white invasion.  So white has the problems.  Stay
confident !
2) When white continues adding stones, try to keep them
separated.  Because you're strong, it's normal that you can cut stones.
White will try desparate, and strange, moves.  Stay confident !
3)
When white threatens to connect all of his stones that are in your
sphere of influence (there's only a small hole at XX, right ?), then
stay confident !  He's having the problems !  Calculate if this
connection is important.  If he uses one move to connect, it means it's
one move that he's not running away.  So you can spend one move trying
to surround him on a big scale (as in the variation).
4) When he
captures stones (that you sacrifice), stay confident !  If you
calculate, you can see if he can make eyes or not.  If his capture
makes him alive, then you must defend.  In this case, the capture
doesn't make him alive.  So you can still capture him on a big scale !]
;W[kf];B[je]TR[jf][je][ke][jd][jc]C[[PL\] This is good, because otherwise your triangled stones become very weak.]
;W[nf]C[It seems I read this one wrong from the start. This cost me alot.]

TR[mi][nh][oh][of]C[[PL\]
Hm, a shame.  Your game was quite good until now.  You were building
the walls, you were chasing his weak groups.

Now, watch the triangled black group !];B[kg];W[lg];B[jg];W[lh]

;B[pm];W[og]TR[mi][nh][mj][lk]C[Ouch, mabey I should pay more attention.

[PL\] :-)
You
were probably quite focused on saving the triangled group.  Don't
worry: if a game like this teaches you to watch your cutting points,
it's not wasted.  Believe me, you'll play several games like this
before you stop making this kind of mistakes.  I'm still doing it ! 
And I get *really* angry at myself for it these days !  But I'm doing
it less and less, so it's a good lesson every time :-)];B[hm]
LB[hl:a]TR[jg][kg][jf][je][jd][jc][ke][ib]C[[PL\]
This move is very nice on big scale, if your centre group would've been
secure.  But it's not yet, and neither is the triangled wall.  This
makes the cut at 'a' very dangerous.]
(;W[hn]TR[hm][hn][im][jm][jo][jq][mq][nq][no][mo][mn][mm][ml]
[mk][lm]LB[cg:a]C[[PL\] Check the variation: white can make your life quite difficult because of your triangled move...

White
is probably right: he doesn't need to make your life very hard.  He's
ahead.  If he quietly stabilises the triangled white group, and he can
play around 'a', he has sufficient.];B[gm];W[gn];B[gj]TR[hn]
[ib][jc][jd][je][jf][jg][kg][ke]C[[PL\]
Because of white's quiet reaction with the triangled stone, black now
has better chances with his center group.  The triangled blacks aren't
stable yet...];W[fm];B[fl];W[el];B[em];W[fn];B[gk]LB[fk:a]C[[PL\] 'a' would've been fine.]
;W[dn];B[dm]C[[PL\]
You're defending a single stone, while white's triangled stone gets
more powerful.  This weakens your corner.

I will give you an
advice that I'm also still working on: when you play a stone, and the
opponent is nearby, then calculate.  What will happen when he reacts ? 
What's on the other side of the opponent ?  Will he get stronger while
I get weaker ?

If you are trying to make life for a weak group,
then it's frequently unavoidable to do this without weakening other
groups.  But in this case, the corner is important for your territory.]
;W[cn];B[cm];W[bn];B[ek];W[bm];B[bl];W[cp]C[[PL\] White could've played more agressively.]
;B[cq];W[bp];B[bq]C[[PL\] ... but you lose some points anyway.]
;W[en];B[cf]C[[PL\] Very good !  Your centre group is now safe(r), so it's time to play big points !]

The most important thing at this moment is the triangled group, not
this side territory.  If you lose points on the side, it's probably 10
points.  The triangled group is 35-40.];W[hf];B[ed];W[fd];B[ee]

White now has a double attack going.  This is a typical splitting
attack: keeping both sides under pressure.

White isn't certain
of a capture yet (and doesn't need it), but he's happy if black lives
in a small way.  If white takes a big corner (XX), and he can stop
black from taking territory on the side, then it's game over.]

;B[df]TR[dd][gd][ie]C[[PL\]
... Then this becomes quite interesting.  Black's triangled stone is
under pressure, but so are white's two triangled stones.

This
situation would become complicated (because of white's answer to
black's triangled stone), but because of the wall, black has the
advantage in this fight.

I've added some extra stones to give you an impression of how the early part of the fight could go.]
;W[ge];B[fe];W[fd];B[he];W[gf];B[hd]LB[jc:a][fc:b][ed:c][cc:d]
[hf:e]C[[PL\]
Now white has the choice: save his triangled stone, or help his corner.
Black can connect to his wall by playing 'a', and make more eye space
by playing 'b'.  In case he becomes stronger later, 'c' is also
interesting.  Or much later, 'd' of course :-)

On the other
hand, white still has lots of small pieces.  Suppose white plays at 'c'
now, then 1) life still isn't certain for the corner, and 2) black 'e'
is nice.

Suppose white plays 'e', check the continuation !];W[hf];B[ee]
;W[ig];B[ji];W[hi];B[fi];W[hk];B[fl]TR[he][hd][gd]C[[PL\]
Just to give you an idea of the strategy: black keeps the pressure up,
while adding stones to the left side.  White's corner isn't alive yet. 
If he makes it alive, black can strengthen his left side even more.

Even if white captures the triangled stones, it's not a problem if black gets the whole left side in return.

Of
course, white will try to capture the triangled black stones, and
reduce/invade the left side !  Only sacrifice the triangled stones if
you're certain you can get enough in return.])))

))
(;B[nk];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi];B[ni]LB[gd:a]C[[PL\]
Black sacrifices 2 stones, but gets a tremendously strong wall and is
connected..  Disadvantage: white gets sente to play e.g. 'a' and limit
the usefulness of your wall.

This sacrifice technique is
something worth watching out for, though.  Do you play with friends ? 
Try to sacrifice some stones from time to time.  You will experience
when the sacrifice is good (like here: very big wall, just over 5
points lost), and when it's bad (too many stones sacrificed, too little
gain, or badly executed).  It's also great fun in fast games: you can
thrown away some stones and win (or lose) spectacularly.]))
(;B[pf];W[nd];B[nf]C[[PL\]
Black builds a nice zone of influence.  White can invade, but this is
not good timing for him.  He has a weak group at the bottom, he doesn't
want a second weak group.]))
(;B[kr];W[kq];B[jr];W[ln]LB[po:a][oo:b][pn:c][on:d][pm:e]C[[PL\]
Suppose white cuts with 'a', you can play 'b', white 'c', black 'd',
white 'e', and white is still under pressure.];B[nn]TR[kr][jr]
LB[po:a]C[[PL\]
By playing the 2 triangled moves, you pressurize him as well.  He
doesn't have time to cut at 'a'.  But when he moves out, you can
connect.

When you defend the cut is a matter of playing style. 
Your choice was nice, though you could've put more pressure on white. 
No problem for you though: white still needs to defend and/or run.]
