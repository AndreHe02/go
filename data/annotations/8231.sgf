C[YGslayer (w) v Suphyph (b)

Sup: I'm Suphyph, and will head my comments with "Sup". Comments with the players full name and rank were made during the game or during a review immediately after the game. Sometimes the comments landed out of context.

Sup: Dear Reviewer, I've put questions throughout, but my two overall questions are: 1. What's my biggest mistake? and 2. What's the single best advice or tip for my improvement? I don't think you need to go very deep in creating variations. I'm mostly looking for whole-board strategic advice. Thanks very much!

burrito: General comments.  White played a very scattered opening - with no regard to weak or strong groups.  Black should have punished white for playing so loosely.  However, black spent too much time trying to force territory instead of attack white's weak groups.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp]LB[fc:B][cf:A]C[Sup: The classical approach is at B, I understand now.

burrito - that would be my preference];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[nq]
;B[qn]LB[cc:A][pn:B][lq:C]C[burrito: when white jumps away from upper left, I would consider playing at A.  you don't have much to fear from a double pincer.  I would also consider B for more influence or to get some fighting in]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[Sup: Is this an appropriate pincer?


burrito - with the white stones at the left, this is pincer is to close.  If I were to pincer here, I'd chose a wider one]

(;B[ch];W[kq];B[fq]C[Sup: Is this the wrong direction? It is pincered and the sequence that follows seems very convenient for white.


I think approaching from the other side is better.];W[hq]C[Sup: This pincer seems natural for white because it is already part of a framework along the bottom. There is also no threat of a counter pincer. Is this assement correct?

;B[bj];W[oe];B[pb];W[mg]
(;B[qg]C[burrito: if this move is meant to threaten the white group, I don't mind it.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[hn]LB[pk:B][jo:A]C[Sup: How important is it to run out with A as compared to playing somewhere around B, which is the most open side?

burrito: B is not urgent];B[jo];W[jg]C[YGslayer [17k\]: right here i was trying to expand my moyo]
(;B[pj]C[burrito: I don't see any merit in this move.  it's too early]
;W[je];B[jd];W[ke];B[kd];W[jm];B[eh];W[gg]LB[fi:A][pr:B]C[Sup: I was wary of the building moyo, but I was also looking to just grab more territory with B. Is A at all effective?]
;B[fi]C[burrito: yes, I think this is more important.  Q2 is a great corner move, but it's good at this point only if it threatens O3]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[pl];B[ql]C[Sup: I thought the following sequence here on the right side played nicely to white's plan to build a moyo. I wanted to keep my territory, but I was quite disappointed with the overall strategic result.

burrito: you are trying to hard to force territory.  In this case, I think you should use your stones in the area to fight more]

(;B[qh];W[pi];B[qi];W[pk]
(;B[qk];W[oj];B[cm]C[Sup: I got the reduction that I had setup with B10. Was it worth it?

burrito: I think I would go after the upper left first.  white doesn't have much potential here.  F11 really keeps white from having much hope]
;W[cn];B[bm];W[dm]
(;B[gb]C[burrito: This can be one further, I think.  Peep at N18 first might be a beter start in the area]
;W[hi]C[Sup: At this move I felt the central moyo was now really serious! Had to do something. I spent over 10 min of my time during the next 10 moves.]

YGslayer [17k\]: yea];B[pm];W[nl];B[nm];W[ml]C[Sup: The moyo is reduced somewhat, but I was not comfortable yet. My next few moves were feeling it out trying to look for a way in.]
;B[mf];W[ng];B[lg];W[lh];B[in];W[im];B[gj]C[YGslayer [17k\]: right here i was afraid of h7 hehe]

;B[lb];W[lf]C[Sup: Does this capture do anything for white? Perhaps the intention was to threaten the top group? I feel like these moves here allow me to come back.

burrito: white is definitely giving you a free move];B[ie];W[me]

;B[np]C[Sup: The sequence in this area made me more comfortable. I think it worked for me in the endgame, and I got 6 points of territory here.]
;W[mq]C[Sup: What's the overall assessment here? I guess black is slightly ahead?

burrito - black is solidly ahead - white has nothing but his very tiny center, which can still be attacked.  There cut in the center and the two corners are all that is left]
;B[oq]C[Sup: I enter 5x30 sec byo-yomi.

burrito - there's really no need for this move now.  You saw the attack on the moyo and bot]
;W[or];B[ii]LB[hh:B][pq:A]C[Sup: This is my last stab into the moyo, but perhaps the game is already decided at this point.

burrito: yes, black has already won, in my opinion.]

;W[jj];B[jk];W[kj];B[kl];W[km];B[hk]C[Sup: Any comments on the overall play of the endgame? Even if the game is decided already, are there any major mistakes in the yose that cost more than 4 or 5 points? Also, do white's move 162 and 212 work to keep sente? Thanks!]
