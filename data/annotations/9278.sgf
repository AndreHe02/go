C[In this game, I have really no clue what happened to me. I suspect my opponent
 to be way stronger than me, because he used no time at all, he was practicall
y blitzing me, so he probably beat me by intuition. Maybe I can learn some of
that intuition by this game.

Hi, Darkas

I'm Dieter Verhofstadt, a 2d in Belgium.

I don't think this opponent was much stronger than you. I will concentrate the comments on "basic technique" and "cut/connect".

1) cut/connect is the main principle in go. Connected stones are stronger. Cut groups need to look after themselves.

2) There are certain basic techniques which we amateurs ignore for the wrong reasons (or for no particular reason). Indeed, the basics are sometimes to be ignored, when the opponent has calculated them into his plan. In this case however, with White blitzing, basic instinct would often be good enough.

My comments will be preceded with dv:];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq]
;B[qk];W[po]LB[fc:D][nc:B][do:C][mp:A]C[dv: We can already see that White is not a particularly strong player. He puts the 3rd stone in pressured area. Any of A,B,C,D would be better.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[np]C[dv: Good! Keima for applying pressure.]
;W[qm]
(;B[ok]C[dv: This is not bad but when you attack, the keima is more usual.. See var.]
;W[nn]LB[lp:B][oq:A]C[Is 12 sente? To me the formation at the bottom looks really safe.

dv: There is a weakness at A. White will try to exploit it to reinforce his pressured group.
This is the reason why Black may simply play B now: it keeps the pressure on the cramped white group. You almost get territory for free (while attacking).]

(;B[pf]C[dv: This is also possible of course. White has made the mistake of coming in early, so he's the one with problems to solve.]
;W[mp]
(;B[no]LB[nq:A]C[I figured he was too thin for this jump, so I wanted to cut him. Also, A
felt too small and he’d get to settle his group too easy.

dv: BASIC TECHNIQUE 1: hane against attachment.

The first move to consider (intuitively) is an outside hane.
The second move to consider is inside hane (cut)
The third move may be A
Only the fourth move is the one you played, because it allows "hane at the head of two" which is in general bad for the one suffering it..

Let's look at those moves.]
(;W[oq]C[dv: an interesting counter but I would simply apply basic technique here (see var).]
;B[or]C[dv: This is basic technique.];W[pp]
(;B[qq]C[dv: I think the two stones are more important. See var.]
;W[nq];B[mo];W[op];B[jd]C[dv: You cannot leave the bottom front like this. Your groups are cut apart and even the corner is not free of worry. White is connected but even for him the situation is unclear.]

(;W[nd]C[dv: White shows his jealous nature. Coming in here is very greedy.]
;B[oc];W[ld];B[gd]C[dv: Good];W[pj];B[pk];W[oh];B[nf]C[dv: Good. Cut!]
;W[mh];B[qh];W[qi];B[ri];W[ph];B[qg];W[mf]C[There is a something about this invasion I don’t like. Sure, I got a lot of
territory, but I don’t think he should be able to connect his groups.

dv: The important this is you are connected. White may seem connected but he's really not.]

(;B[cf]C[dv: You're leaving the front too early. See var.];W[oe]
;B[of];W[nc]
(;B[ob]C[dv: You can still cut. See var.];W[df];B[dg];W[ce]
;B[ef];W[de];B[cg]C[dv: This is good.];W[ff]C[dv: This is a strange move.]

(;B[ec];W[eg]
(;B[eh]C[dv: BASIC TECHNIQUE 2 - extend from atari.

This is probably too obvious, but why didn't you save the cutting stone?]
;W[fg];B[dl]C[dv: Again: save the cutting stone.];W[dj]C[Was the jump too far?

dv: Yes, but the main point is cutting.];B[di];W[dk]
(;B[co]C[dv: BASIC TECHNIQUE 3 - extend against a jump. See var.]
;W[fi]LB[ee:A]C[dv: difficult now. You need time to move out at A.]
;B[ci];W[bj];B[bi];W[cl];B[dm];W[be];B[bf];W[cm];B[cn];W[bp]
LB[fd:A]C[dv: White too by the way should be focused on the cut at the top, by playing A for example]
;B[fo];W[en];B[eo];W[fm];B[lp]LB[dn:A]C[dv: You're leaving the front again, while A can be cut. Of course, you return to an earlier front, so it's not bad.]
;W[mq];B[fq]C[dv: Good!];W[dn];B[do];W[hq]C[dv: White is very agressive. His corner is weak now.]
;B[kq];W[ho];B[fn];W[em];B[hn];W[io];B[in];W[jo]
(;B[ko]LB[jn:A]SQ[in]C[dv: BASIC TECHNIQUE 4 - small gaps.

You can read about small gaps at Senseis Library.

leaving a small gap at A is almost always very bad
sure your groups are both not stable but allowing a cut like A is just too good for White.
