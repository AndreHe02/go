C[Hi, my name is Trina-Lynn, and I will be your reviewer. From this point on, my comments will be marked with TL.]
;B[pd];W[cq];B[pp];W[dc]C[I really don't know much about fuseki. I feel maybe I should have adapted mine to fit his slightly unusual one.

TL: It's not unusual...or to put it correctly...this fuseki is only rare in kyus' game. You will see it many times
      in pro games or dans or even high kyus'.];B[qj];W[nc]

(;B[qf]C[
TL: At this point, it gives me the feeling that b is slightly overconcentrated. The pincer seems better (see variations)]
;W[pb];B[qc]C[ TL: This clearly is overconcentrated];W[ce];B[mq]
;W[pn]LB[pn:1]C[ TL: W's invasion here feels a little bit early.]
;B[qn];W[qm];B[rn];W[ql]C[I don't understand what he was trying to accomplish here.

 TL: This might be just psychological effect. W probably feels that b's right side is closing and thus he wants a piece of it.]

(;B[fq]C[ TL: This move is not ideal, since w is on 3-3. The right way to attack would be D4 (see variations)]
;W[iq]C[I wasn't sure where to approach a sansan point so I just played somewhere close on the third line.]
;B[fo]C[
 TL: B is going easy on w. Now w can run, split b and feels happy about his accomplishment. Again, this is the direct result fromthe extension at F3]
;W[io];B[co]C[I thought maybe I could get the corner or at least some influence.]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[eo];B[en];W[dn];B[do];W[cn]
(;B[dp]C[this move looks wrong retrospectively but I can't figure out what it should have been]
;W[bo];B[hn]C[Was this the best place to attack the white group?

 TL: No, since after this,  (1)  b looses the corner and (2) w gets out just fine. W also has forcing move at E 7 (see variations)]

(;W[cp];B[dq];W[em];B[fn];W[in];B[gm]C[
 TL: This move is unecessary.];W[dj]TR[dm][bn][bp]C[I feel that I should have played around there before he did.

 TL: W still has lots of weaknesses here (see variations). And thus an invasion is possible.]

(;B[ic]C[I didn't know where to approach so I just went about halfway between the two stones.

 TL: B should have put pressured on the upper right group. Either (1) play close to it or (2) push down from above if b wants to get influence (see variations)]
;W[kc]
(;B[gc]C[
TL: This is small. F 17 is the right move.];W[dr];B[eq];W[dg]
;B[er]C[My opponent didn't seem to think the local situation was urgent as he played  tennuki herebut it seems like it would be to me.

 TL: This is a yose move. Try something like C6 or C4 instead.]
;W[pk]C[I still don't understand what he was doing here

 TL: W is trying to make a good shape.This move is not really ideal, though.]

(;B[gh]C[
 TL: B tries to connect/ extend, but this move doesn't really accomplish anything.]
;W[gf]
(;B[fg];W[ff];B[ig];W[je];B[he];W[ie];B[hf]C[He seems to be putting himself into bad shape here for reasons I can't fathom.

 TL: W misreads.];W[id];B[hd];W[ne]
(;B[oi]C[
 TL: This move looks out of place. The idea to seperate w is good, though.]
;W[pj];B[pi];W[nk];B[il];W[qk]C[
 TL: W moves here is small. B should not answer. Instead b should L7 or some near place to separate the 2 w groups.]
