(;B[qe]C[[CB\] you can't cut white here, so don't play this forcing move, no purpose right now]
;W[re];B[pf];W[qg]TR[fe][cl][ip]C[[CB\] here are the three possible moves I see next for black]
;B[cc]C[Was this a bit too early? Maybe a play at C3 first?

[CB\] C17 is not the good direction: white can choose to let black the corner and build strength against the top side, so it's not coherent with the way black played so far

[CB\] C3 is possible, but I'd prefer C8 to split white side]
;W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]
(;B[fb]C[[CB\] Too early, leave it for later. And even with this move, the top side has been a bit damaged, now...]

(;B[ep]C[[CB\] continue to press white, don't fear the cut]

(;W[cq]C[[CB\] help your weakest stones];B[jq]C[[CB\] why not, but with the same ides, L3 may be better: white will build some strength while escaping, and K3 will find itself too close to this strength]
;W[hp];B[go];W[ho];B[gm];W[jo]C[[CB\] Yes, that's why black K3 was better in L3.]
;B[lp];W[im];B[gk];W[dk];B[em];W[dm]
(;B[di]C[[CB\] too deep]
(;W[ci]C[[CB\] white should not refuse the fight!]
(;B[ch]C[[CB\] ok, but still white answered low, I'd prefer sticking to the idea of building influence]
;W[cj]
(;B[fi];W[dh]
(;B[eh]C[[CB\] don't bother answering!];W[dg];B[af]C[[CB\] too soon, it's an end-game move, you have to be sure white will answer it]
;W[ag];B[ae];W[bh];B[nh]TR[fd][jd][hf][pf]SQ[ge][ie][og]C[[CB\] We call this shape the "elephant's eye": it's a bad shape because a single move can (usually, not always of course) separate the two stones]
;W[fa]C[[CB\] too soon, end-game move]
(;B[hb]C[[CB\] No, ignore it!]
(;W[ha]C[[CB\] Still an end-game move, white has better to do]

(;B[ia]C[[CB\]];W[ga];B[ic];W[pg];B[og];W[hl]C[This was was not sente, aye? Was it better to make a bigger moyo?

[CB\] At least, it's helping the weak group, and reducing black moyo. It *may* lead to attacks on black later on... not a bad move. Even if I still prefer playing something like J10 directly.]
;B[gl];W[ki]C[[CB\] too deep, not really connected to anything, like floating in the air...]
;B[kg]TR[jk]C[Was this move too defensive? White DID make a pretty big jump

[CB\] Yes, too defensive: white has a weak group he didn't help, so better attack him with a move around the triangle]

;B[hk];W[ij]
(;B[il];W[jl];B[hm];W[ll];B[ml];W[mm];B[rn]C[[CB\] big, but something like E6 or F8 is more important]

(;W[qn];B[rm];W[rl];B[ro];W[cr];B[qk]C[[CB\] yes, that's the problem with R6... but it is not so big, since the sequence is gote and there are still big sente moves on the board for both sides - in my opinion, black should protect the cut at F9, that his bigger problem]
