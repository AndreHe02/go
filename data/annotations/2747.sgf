C[Hi, i want to thank the reviewer for taking your time to review this game. I played white and i felt like i made many mistakes. I am somewhat still a beginner and my 17k rank does not reflect well on me. I am really a 20k. THank you

xxc: Hi, nice to you to submit, and to comment what you want to fix.

I'll try my best to give you tools to go up, but do not forget it will be mostly ideas than right path to follow stone by stone.

I'll say in text when to look at var ("stone start" var "number") ... (35v2)
Use also UR for upper right corner, RS for right side an so on ... 

I'll follow the game and read it as a book ... come on !];B[pp]
TR[sa][jj][sj]C[xxc : usualy on the half upper right corner ... easy to follow standards (back-up/help) paterns and search on databases ...
Opening like that may add refexion to turn the board in mind and i think we have no place to do that while playing !

But after all ... perhaps it's better to get of standards and play our own moves :)]
;W[pc]C[xxc : nice to let black choose betwin cross corner or not :)

Try to stay  in 4-4 openings. I may be easier to manage ... nearer handicap games we still have to play.
Other corner stones may leads to difficults patern ... and i think that we have a lot of other things to understand before.]
;B[cp];W[cd]LB[ec:2][qe:1][jp:C][eq:A][jq:B]C[xxc : what is the meaning of all these moves ?

Black 
A to close the corner and have strengh on the left side
BC to chinese opening

White ... same has A, but
1 is nice to extend and get a good shape on the upper side
2 will face a potential strong corner and let whites with two low stones on the upper side.]
;B[iq]C[xxc : low chinese

Interesting to know the idea behind this patern no ?
Thikness to fight on the right side ... and points on the left side.
What black wants is white to come at E4 to go on with his plan.]
;W[qn];B[ql]C[xxc: pincer ... always difficult to manage

The question here is getting out (9v1) or contest the corner (9v2)]

(;W[qp]TR[pn][qq]C[xxc : this will lets black with a wall facing the lower side]
;B[qq]C[xxc : might be intersting to think using the upper stone here ... and get out (10v1) as blakc do not want to let the corner]

(;W[rp];B[po]LB[pn:A]C[xxc : A still possible i think];W[rq]
;B[qr];W[rr]C[xxc : will be enough for white

Black have a wall facing the lower side now]
(;B[or]LB[ec:A][qe:B]TR[oq]C[xxc: it's too small now and the cut do not hurt so mutch (15v1)
Why not protect with a higher move ?

White to play ?
Corner (LR) seems safe ... lower side have no more interest (now) ... black is low ... upper side no ?

A to start walking towards lower side (16v1)
B to take the upper side (16v2)]
(;W[pn]C[xxc : black can let that ... no real problem for him in the lower side ... he can let white take the right]

(;B[lq]C[xxc : too low and small (17v1))

Bottom is black now ... wait for a reducing move latter and play as far as possible now.
Corner is ok ... can get out or live 

Good idea to add stones at UR or UL.];W[cn]C[xxc : too near ! (19v1)]

(;B[dn]C[xxc : mmm ... contact move to defend ?

This will make white stronger ... it may be interesting if black also needs to get stronger, but not here.]
;W[dm];B[do];W[em];B[fp]TR[dh]C[xxc : side now ... i think it's really important here

White comes too near from black strong LS ... he ends with a rather easy patern (black too submissive here), white have to protect his group not to be under presure latter.
This will reduce the strengh black build on LS ... looking at the RS there is nearly the same situation ... it is almost as if black can't use his strengh, so black stones are only to take points ... and i think it's too much stones for that at this stage of the game.]
;W[nn]C[xxc : this may R8 walk (25v1)... or ...  LS group to be under attack(25v2)]

(;B[pe]TR[pc][cd][em]SQ[ql]C[xxc : a way to use R8

White have to think whole board here.
Marked white stones made big big moyo !!! (too big).
Marked black is useless now ... but may be used with Q15 if white push Q15 along the side.
(26v1)]
(;W[qe];B[qf];W[re]TR[qd]C[xxc : better at R16 ?];B[rf];W[pd]
;B[qi]TR[cd][pd][dm][nn]C[xxc : black save R8 and get a good shape here

White strengh is on upper and left now];W[md]TR[cd][pd][em]
[nn]C[xxc : seems small ... but it is the good way ... big for white even with all that space

black have to enter the last corner now];B[ed]LB[ec:A][df:B]
C[xxc: upper side or not

Upper right corner is ok
Better to push black this way ... so B (34v1)]
(;W[ec]C[xxc : this will push black towards the lower left group]
;B[ce];W[dd];B[de]
(;W[fd]C[xxc: this is difficult to explain !

Black can't let i think ... but white lose E15 now !

E15 seems difficult to follow ... but why not ( and be really big latter (38v1))]
;B[ee]TR[dc][fc]C[xxc :leaves two cut points];W[fe];B[di]TR[dm]
[em][cn]C[xxc : white may tkae car of his group now];W[ci]TR[cj]
C[xxc: this will open a fight];B[cj];W[bj];B[ch];W[bi];B[bh]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[dk]LB[cb:G][jc:H][sc:D][dg:A][dh:1][sk:E][bl:B]
[sp:C][fr:F]C[xxc: ok for both

Fast count ?
(start to think counting arround this part of the game ... earlier is also ok but maybe mor difficult)

A=B
C+D=E
F=G+H

I explain this
A & B are small living space ... each group can live with few points

C, D & E 
E can extend toward center ... and is open at bottom
C is small ... and D add an happpy amount of points ...
If E can be sealed at bottom ... this will be equal
If E invaded at bottom ... C will expend ... and E gets more in the center.

F is sure and closed ... but low
H is open and high

All that will be fix latter.

Center now ... no points here !!! Not now

1 is a problem for black ... LR can be one for white.

I'll play O8 to reduce H latter (51v1)]
(;B[eh]TR[jd][je][jf]C[xxc : ok ... protect the cut

(try a cut with white ... it's difficult)

 ... white have to play ?
No black group to attack ... no white group to defend ... so extend ... K16 or bigger

This can be done by cutting at Q14 (52v1)]
(;W[gn]LB[rn:1][gp:A]C[xxc : this one ... why ?

I do not feel the group is in a bad situation
Threat for lower side ... i do not see effective effect ... A ? ... and what after ? ... cut, why must black answer ? He had 2 living groups on each side ... white add G6, A and an other one to cut ... so 3 stones elsewhere for black.

I do not enjoy to say that but this move is a bad move to me.
Do not forget lower right is alive ... if you enter the bottom ... black let you cut and get out ... he can latter threat to cut at 1 and get points on the side.
If black follow white ... with this thinking : ok, white think his right group is not safe (i don't care a cut at lower side) ... let's push him to connect to right side ... (53v)]

(;B[go]C[xxc : had to lose this thinking ... G5 add nothing to black (ok a few points under ... but it's not really important)

For white ... do not think that a black answer means your move is good !
What if you lose this stone ? I'll make an extreme var here ... black kill G6 and white let him do that  !! (54v1)]

(;W[oe]C[xxc : please go on with this comment.

P15 ... move 54, same as F16, lose Q14 option.
It changes a little US, white get stronger here and it will be harder for black to invade
What if black let the stone ? (55v1)]
(;B[pf]C[xxc: result ... RS is safer now.

Not sure is a good trade ?];W[je]C[xxc : this one is big.

Let's comme back at (54v2) but with this move before and one more stone for black to make R group saffer]

White 77
Black 63

Ok, it's a strange way to count ... but a good information, white is ahead and looking at center, i do not see how he can lose too much points here.

Black must go on to reduce and attack ... white must extend safely.

Black to play ?
B17 ?
Center ?];B[bc]C[xxc : can white let his stones ? (60v1)]

If white play elsewhere ... black to start now

E18 F18 ... mmm interesting after, let you try all moves ... just one (62var1)

Better to go down qith B18 at C18 i think or let all that for latter and have a move elsewhere.]

Black might have choose a stronger move  here];W[db];B[ab]C[xxc : this let D19 black sente]
;W[fc]C[xxc : come back to counts ... wasn't it better to let black take the corner and have stones elsewhere seeing the result ? It's nearly the same result than the end of 60v1 and with a white stone elsewhere in var.

Not strong enought ... sorry :( ... i can't say which is better.]
;B[jj]LB[sf:3][rj:A][rm:2][bo:1]C[xxc : strong move ... kill all points in the center.

An other count ?

Nearer for black ... it's the result of his points in the corner while white gets not so much more at US

Time to think yose moves now.
The center seems to be off.
All groups looks fine.

Reducing at sides with sente will be a good idea ... where ?

Let's see 1,2 (not really sure it's sente for white !) (68v1&2)
Try 3 ? (68v3)
Another one ?
Do not think there is other interesting moves at side.
In the center ... why not, but first side moves here. The only part white can add points is arround M14 and H14.]

(;W[ng]C[xxc : i'll mark this one before no ?

Comming back from previous thinking on yose, black must K15 now, he had no chance to play on UR ... let's see (69v1)

Other one ? C7 ... (69v2) ... C6 ? (69v3)

T15 must be played now for black, he can't lose as much points in an other part of the board if white play elsewhere.]

xxc : overall comment.

First of all good game for seeing his level explanation, but i think this game was close.

It is this stage wall to get through ... have a good start at the begining, not lose too easyly a corner or big group in a corner patern ... find the good ways to extend ... and then when to start yose moves and play big ones.

In this game i feel that white can have an easier winnig game by playing big extension at the middle game instead of fighting in the middle, then reduce with good connected stones the center and then take big side yose moves.

Reading and fight is also to be improved ... the upper side his a good exemple ... trying to read what may arise here during the game might have been usefull ... and instead of going on with center moves, adding a stone in that part of the board might be a good idea an save many point.

That's all.
I hope it may add tools to your games ... thank u.])
