C[Difficult game to comment on.
An awful lot of moves do seem entirely natural and suddenly W is miles behind.

A few extra comments are included following discussions at my club.
Those comments are marked with '***'];B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd];B[eq];W[cj]
C[Personally, I prefer to prevent the second shimari, however this this is played by professionals so presumably it can't be wrong

*** general consensus is that preventing
the shimari was prefered, but 6 was OK];B[cf];W[cm];B[nc];W[pf]
C[ Quiet, but the move I usually play.  I suspect that a wide pincer does more to oppose B's plans, but I don't know that it's better.]
;B[jd]C[B has lots of 3rd line stones, so this begins to balance things up]
;W[jq]C[*** Another player of the same strength
as me suggests playing on the 4th line.
Our tame 4 dan didn't see anything wrong with either.

We thought about playing on the right, but ended up prefering this.]
;B[qk];W[qi]C[Feels a little cramped  I wonder whether pushing from below might work better?

*** no one objected here];B[qn];W[qo]MA[ro]C[Seems like a natural move

*** 1kyu prefered the marked point.
4dan said he tends to prefer W's move - likes over-concentrating B.]
;B[pn];W[np];B[pb]C[*** I felt that B was rather having his own way here. 1 kyu and I explored alternatives such as invading between 9 and 11.

4 dan liked playing your moves.
He comments that when B played the this move he was choosing to give up sente.]
;W[qc]C[ This is either a very patient move or too slow.  I would prefer to prevent B's next move by jumping out there myself.

*** so I was wrong, your move is good];B[ne]C[*** all of us agree that this is vital for B and hence he has given up sente.]
(;
(;W[gc]C[ I think that this is probably not the right point.  W has no real way to make a base

*** 1kyu suggest a high invasion or one point to the right,

4dan says that W's move is actually OK.
But he also suggests the alternative shown in the variation.];B[ic];W[ge];B[gg]C[Very tough now

*** general consensus was that B was being rather optimistic.
Problem is that he's rather commiting to building
a wall facing 6 and 8 and so it's hard to use that thickness.]
(;W[ff]C[ This is probably bad, danger is that B will press on 6 and 8 and hence leave no where to go  Must admit though it is hard to see how to make sense of this group

*** consensus that this *was* bad,

See variation.];B[eh];W[dd];B[cd];W[cc];B[de];W[ec];B[db];W[ed]
;B[bc];W[eb];B[cb];W[hb];B[ib];W[eg]MA[fb]C[ I don't see the reason for this move. It just encourages B to build a wall to threaten 6 and 8  I think a play at the marked point lives.  If it does then W should just live. The more he squirms on the inside the stronger B gets.]
;B[dh];W[dg];B[cg];W[gq];B[eo];W[em]MA[dl]C[Yes important to strengthen these stones now.  Troble is that this shape is a little vulnerable to the peep. Suggest something such as the marked point - probably that is ugly but we want to avoid B having the kind of attack coming up.]
;B[hf]C[ If this is sente B is going to get a huge mojo - nice move]
;W[he];B[ie];W[nn]C[ Assuming that 49 was not sente this is a reasonable idea. But perhaps a one point jump from 14 might help to keep B's top under control.]
;B[pi]C[This is a nice move];W[ph];B[pj];W[oh];B[qq]
(;W[pq]C[*** I forgot to say this, playing the marked point instead of 56 is the tough way to play.

My 1 kyu colleague felt that B's 13,15,17 group should come under severe attack.

I think he's right, but it hard to play that way because you allow your large area to be devastated if B has the courage to allow 2 moves against the upper group.];B[ro]C[ Even though it's huge I would tenuki from here]
;W[rp];B[qp];W[rq];B[po];W[qr];B[ee]C[I may be wrong but this seems like a a very severe attack.]
;W[fe];B[fb];W[fa]
(;B[gb]C[However this lets W off the hook];W[fc];B[dl]LB[mh:a]

(;W[dm]C[I understand W's desire to connect to the middle, but is this safe?  B is very strong aorund here, danger is that W just gets a floating group in the centre.]
;B[cl];W[bm]C[ Seems too good to be true.  At first sight I was convinced that this was unreasonable for W. However I can't prove it tactically.]

;B[hj];W[di];B[ei];W[ci];B[fj];W[bh]C[ Locally W has lived and got some good yose plays in. Strategically this is not so good.]
;B[ch];W[bj];B[mh]C[ A count now shows that the  3 B territories Top left, bottom right and bottom left total about the same as W;s top left bottom left and top right.  So the game comes down to a comparison of the top centre B and the bottom W.  99 is huge and B seems about 5 points ahead after komi.]
;W[ji]C[ Very difficult to find the right place.  Much less than this and the game's conceded.]
;B[jk];W[li];B[kh];W[ki];B[lh];W[qb]C[Very cool.
Are the three stones really connected out?]
;B[rj];W[ri];B[fr];W[ob];B[nb];W[jh];B[jg];W[nf];B[mf];W[oe]
;B[me];W[ll]C[B should have asked W to prove the connect earlier.]
;B[is];W[ir];B[gs];W[js];B[km];W[lm];B[ko];W[kl];B[kn]C[ W now gets punished for not looking after the centre stones earlier. There may be better tactical things but the real point is that 106 and 110 both ignored a very pressing weakness.]

(;W[hq]C[ You virtually have to play here sometime soon. By playing it immediately you leave B the problem.  The idea is that if you're thinking of a sequence that goes "I play 1, he plays 2 I [play 3" 
examine the idea of just playing 3 immediately. 
 
Very often that approach yields a gain of sente 
or at least leaves more aji to exploit];B[go];W[jo];B[gm]C[ Same overall effect as the game, but B's position is not so solid]
