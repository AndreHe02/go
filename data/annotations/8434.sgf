C[Matt: I am black - I've commented where I'm unsure of the best move (but there are probably a lot of poor moves I didnt catch!).
I lost the game on a couple of big misreads, but there are a few points near the start of the game where I think I could have made better moves locally, and several points in the middlegame where I think I was overplaying or being too agressive despite being ahead.

Hi!

I'm Saurus, 3 kyu on KGS.

I have reviewed this game for the black side.

This was a wonderful game to review. I actually disagree with your assessment above and feel your loss was due more to strategical blunders than reading. As such, I have focused more on strategy and have commented wherever appropriate.

Wherever I have offered variations on a move, I have marked [SEE VARIATION\] in my comments.

The way I have reviewed this game is from my understanding as a 3k. Perhaps a stronger player may review differently, but I have merely commented according to my understanding of the game.

Sometimes some of my comments may seem harsh. I apologize if I occasionally come accross as very harsh. This is just my style of reviewing, and no disrespect is intended.

I have commented in detail on the subtleties of most moves, where the move was not obvious, and I have offered variations where appropriate.

I have also given a detailed summary of key concepts that you need to focus on at the end of the game.

Regards
Mark

[qk:B][de:A]C[The usual moves here are A-E.

Yours is an unusual move, but playable. 

The stone at k4 is saying: 
"I'm high, which means that I don't want territory along the bottom. Rather, I want to build a moyo along the right side. Also, I'm willing to fight, since I can easily run to the center, and cannot be killed."]
;W[mq]C[Wow! White played right in black's sphere of influence. You should be celebrating!
When white does something so suicidal, you must take advantage. Attack it!!!

Q: How do we attack a stone?
A: Press it against a strong group.

Q: Do we have a strong group yet?
A: No

Q: So what do I do?
A: Make either k4 or q3 strong by attacking something elsewhere.
(Note: This must be done by attacking in order to keep sente. If you strengthen q3 by playing q5, n3 will escape.)

Q: Is there anything to attack which can strengthen one of my two stones?
A: Yes - D4!]
(;B[gq]LB[fq:A]C[This move is just ridiculous!
What on earth is it's purpose?

Q: Does it help to protect k4?
A: No - k4 is already high, so can run to the center and cannot be killed.
(OK, it does help to strengthen the stone if you intend to attack n3, but it's gote, so white can simply play at k3. You must always protect/strengthen in sente if possible. This is so important in the game of Go.)

Q: Does it make any territory?
A: No, because k4 is high and n3 can slide underneath with k2 if he wants to stop you from making territory.

Q: Does is attack d4?
A: No - it is too far - white can simpy play e3, and it is suddenly the black group that is under attack!

You should have played at A.

[SEE VARIATION FOR EXPLANATION\]];W[jq]C[White must play defensively, so this contact move is appropriate.]
(;B[iq]LB[kq:A]C[Matt: Is it better to hane at A?

Saurus: Yes - white is heavily outnumbered by the black stones, so a fight here favours black.

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[jr]
(;B[ce]C[Wait!!!

***You cannot tenuki while a fight is unsettled! EVER!***

The fight at the botton is not finished yet!

I'm sure you have often heard talk about shape. What happens if white plays at L4? Then the white group is settled and strong, and the black group is suddenly under severe attack. We then say that  white has made good shape.

This cannot be allowed. If there is a point which gives white good shape, this point is vital and black both sides must strive to play it first. The good news is that such vital points are usually also sente.

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[fd];B[dg]C[Good!];W[ci]
(;B[ch]LB[fg:B][cc:A]SQ[bf][bg][cg][cf]C[You can't be serious?

Four points of territory in gote. What's the point?

What about a nice move like A or B?

[SEE VARIATIONS\]];W[di]
(;B[cm]LB[cn:B][cc:A]C[ Is it better to move into the corner with A?

Absolutely! Always strengthen your weaknesses in sente first...

[SEE VARIATION\]

Now, more importantly, what's with the dreadfully passive no-purpose moves in the middle of nowhere? C7 is absolutely horrible!

Why not B? It attacks white strongly and has a possible three space extension at c9. White cannot allow this extension, and so must pincer, allowing you to take the corner (and in sente too)!

[SEE OTHER VARIATION\]

You seriously need to stop playing weak moves like g3 and c7 and must be more assertive.]
;W[dm]C[Contact move by white? This is odd, since he is trying to attack. Contact moves should be for defense only.]
(;B[cp]C[Playing at c4 is asking to be cut apart!

C7 is completely misplaced. It's in white's sphere of influence. It can live, but white will get a huge corner in return.

Better to sacrifice it and take the corner. At least you get sente this way.

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[cn]C[Now you have two weak groups. One of them must die.

It cannot be helped. Making two weak groups means you have decided to sacrifice one of them.]

I am so glad you didn't r6!];W[om];B[nn]LB[ok:A]C[Matt: This seems to be a bit of a useless move - was trying to attack the two white stones. Would playing at A with he aim of building a framework on the right side be better

Saurus: On the contrary! I think this is a wonderful move. It splits the two white groups apart. This is one of the key strategies that pro players aim to play for. It's called a splitting attack and is a very strong move!]
;W[pj]
(;B[pi]C[There is a standard sequence (joseki)  for this position.

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[jd]LB[md:B][mc:A]C[Matt: Overplay. Would A or B be the better move here?

Saurus: Not at all. I really like k16. The double-wing moyo is very hard to invade, and you should make lots of territory from chasing white around if he tries.]
;W[md]
(;B[nc]C[OK - have you forgotten that you gave up the r9 stone becaue you wanted to make territory top right?

Don't forget your aims so easily. Try to keep focus...

A move consistent with your previous moves would be p14, a dual-purpose move which completes your previous goal AND attacks n16.

[jb][ka][ba][aa]C[I have summarized here the most important concepts that I feel you need to focus on, in order of priority.

There are two areas which I feel need drastic and urgent attention in your play.

1. The first is your total disregard for safety of your groups. Four times, you failed to play the final move securing your groups. (In this game, you omitted c17, f12, r16 and h10) which ultimately cost you the game. Do not tenuki until your groups are safe! Sometimes, a gote move is necessary to protect your investments. Keep a special lookout for cutting point in you games. Most of the above omissions were failure to spot fatal cuts.

2. In direct contrast to omitting safety moves above, you have an uncontrollable urge to play gote moves to save one or two points/stones, even if it costs you 20 points to save those two stones.
Examples of this were moves 15 (c12), 37 (e4), 173 (h18) and 177 (j19). Every time you did this, there was a 20-point move or bigger on the board just begging to be played. You can't save everything! Sometimes, you just have to let those small moves go. As long as you play reflex moves like these, you will not improve. Work hard on looking around on every move for just a second or two for a bigger move before replying to protect one or two points or stones.

In addition to the two serious issues above, the following areas of your play also needs work...

3. Your reading is still lacking. I'm sure you've heard this a hundred times, but do life and death problems. Some examples of reading errors which could be eliminated by doing just a few reading problems daily are moves 29 (e9), 197 (L13), and 233 (h6).

4. Avoid weak moves which have no effect on your opponent (such as moves 7 (g3) and 17 (c7). I have commented in detail on those moves as to why they are bad. Play more assertively, and don't fear your opponent.

5. Don't use contact moves when attacking. You probably know this rule, but still, it does still sometimes manage to creep into our play. Examples of where you let this rule slip were moves 59 (n18) and 67 (g16).

Finally, two minor points (but still important) that you should keep in mind are...

6. Don't tenuki while the fight is still on (such as move 11 (c15).)

7. Play with purpose. Never forget the reason why you played a previous move. Follow through with your plans (Example: 017 should have been at p14).

I hope my review and comments helped!    :)])
