C[Hello,

This is a 25 minutes + 5 * 30 seconds byo-yomi game. I played black and won by a few points.

Lately I've been playing slower games and did a lot of tsumego, and I tend to look for fights by building large moyos. In this game my attacks kind of fizzled and I'm hoping a review might reveal some of the reasons. I ended up attacking without enough strength to back up the attacks, then working rather hard for each point of territory.

I added some comments in the game (the paragraphs prefixed with 'MB').

Thank you,
Miron Brezuleanu

Hi Miron,

I hope you like my review.  As I usually do, I will comment on moves as I see them during a first pass and then go back and comment more carefully after I have seen the finished result.  All of my comments will be prefixed with two dashes, and comments I make after the first pass will be clearly marked.  The reason that I do two passes is that I've found I make more intelligent comments on the second pass, but I also think it's useful to highlight things I didn't see first time either.

Note that I'm only three or so stones stronger than you so I suggest you treat any suggestions I make with caution.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[cp]
(;B[op]C[MB: I'm not sure what do here. I want to build influence, and this (or the simetrical play) seems the only way to build without losing sente. Another alternative is playing K16, but for some reason I'm not comfortable with it.
--
I personally prefer K16, white's shape is very hard to fix in a single move.  Typically I've found in this position white answers K16 with K4 but, while you cannot exactly punish white, the weakness at the bottom seems to cause white problems.

Another move I have seen in this position is K3 and I would prefer this to P4 myself in order to prevent white answering you with a wide pincer.  The advantage of K3 is that whichever shimari white takes you can approach the other 3-4 stone from the 5-4 point and K3 is perfectly positioned to support it]
;W[lp]
(;B[on]C[--
I don't like this variation as black much.  I would go for the standard Q7 because with Q16 your shape works out really well when split in 2.]
;W[qn];B[ol];W[ql]
(;B[jq]C[MB: Trying to start a fight.
--
This is fine, but I would be almost certain R3 is sente.];W[ln]
;B[fp]C[MB: I'm trying to settle my K3 stone and keep an eye on the corner. This move seems a little vague :-)

MB: I've also considered G3.
--
I think I would have played E3.  G3 feels like it invites white E3 and white would be happy]
;W[dm];B[eq]C[MB: Is F3 better? I wanted to get closer to the corner, but I'm probably too greedy.
--
This is fine.  F3 also fine.  I slightly prefer this to F3 myself]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[MB: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Any suggestions? (other alternatives considered when doing my review: capping at M8 or playing a higher pincer at H16 or J16)
--
I would have played C14 for sure.  M8 feels too early - those two white stones are not possible to capture in another move after M8 so white could ignore for now and anyway M8 doesn't develop your black stones in an interesting way.  Locally R3 and/or R9 are more interesting.]
;W[fe];B[df]C[--
You can also consider C14 here.  Since C7 is low the left will not develop much and the reduced aji makes C12 far less urgent]
;W[id];B[hd];W[he]C[--
Be careful going to H16 before J17 - you give white variation options which are sometimes better.]
;B[ic];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[lc]C[--
I think you can be quite happy with this result, Q16 feels well placed]
;W[me];B[ll]C[MB: This should have been at N17, but it felt better to put some pressure on white (I'm thinking that if white gets M8, my three stones on the right end up too weak).
--
N17 (or almost anything there - O17 also works) is a must really.  If you omit it then white N17 defeats the point of Q16.  Also I'm not that taken by M8 as I already mentioned.]
;W[jp];B[kq]C[MB: Don't know how to handle K4. L3 seems a good enough idea, but white getting M3 is kind of painful.
--
I would have played J3 instead of L3, but L3 seems ok.  The advantage of J3 is that it's almost sente with L3 or M2 as follow-up and you can ignore white's next local move]
;W[lq];B[iq]C[MB: This seemed to settle the black stones in this area (group J3 and E3/F4).
--
Yes, it's  painful to omit it but then omitting N17 is also painful.  I'm not sure which I would prioritise fixing.  Actually, I think I would prioritise here because with M8 in place the M6 stones are coming under real pressure now.]
;W[jm];B[qq]C[MB: I need to make sure the groups don't link up. I also considered P2.
--
Locally this is the right move I think - P2 doesn't threaten M2 so feels too passive.  Globally I still worry about N17.]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[rr];B[pj]C[MB: P10 seems a little too soft. I'd like to settle my group so I can attack. I'm worried that when white got the influence on the upper side I needed to start defending all around. Maybe H17 was to blame?
--
Q10 feels much too soft to me - what's wrong with R9? You have M8 if white tries to cut so should be fine. J9 is also not bad.]
;W[rj];B[jk];W[il];B[ik]C[MB: I'm trying to push the groups closer together before splitting them. This also helps my stones in the lower right area.

MB: Maybe H9 was better? I kind of missed the rather obvious fact that cutting D7 and J8 will push J8 towards H15 :-)
--
Locally it doesn't seem that interesting.  You're building strength towards H15 but H15 is strong so it's not an interesting target to attack.  Apart from N17, I like S11 and somewhere around C10]
;W[gl];B[fl]C[--
This attack feels too ambitious but if you give it up well it might provide useful aji against D7 which looks tempting.]
;W[hk]
(;B[fm]C[--
I would go C9 directly];W[dk];B[fj];W[hi];B[ci]C[--
There is still a weakness at C6, but it's much smaller];W[cj]
;B[cq]C[--
I would have D11 first even if it means losing this move - D11 works really well with D14.

After the review I changed my mind, this is very big.];W[bq]
;B[co]C[MB: Is this an overplay? I want to split white in two here, but the result was beyond my reading ability.
--
As long as you don't mind losing C3 this will threaten to split white.  However since white can live with C12 it may not be worth it.]
(;W[bo]C[MB: ... but white playes quietly.
--
Yes, you can be happy with that - sente and forcing white to the second line]
;B[dp];W[bp];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[bk];B[bi]C[--
I think you're winning now, though I worry about having both C2 and N17 urgent]
;W[di];B[fh]C[--
I quite like this.  My initial thought was D12 is bigger but I think the renewed attack more than makes up for it]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[cr];B[ej]C[--
Strange move.  Also I think D2 is sente and after white captures the ko you get more aji there.]
;W[dj];B[hg]C[--
D2 again.];W[ij]
(;B[jj]C[MB: Maybe K13 or K14 was better here?
--
Well, I would have played K13 myself.  It feels much more like it attacks both groups.  This feels like it starts to make those J9 stones heavy]

This feels too slow.  Compare to say S11];W[kg];B[ge]

(;B[ri];W[qc]
(;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[rf]C[MB: getting back the corner and losing S14 seems OK, as white won't make many points with the group around S14, and I get some territory on the upper side.

I would also go this way]

S8 is bad, this whole sequence went really well for you.  You've fixed N17, R17, and S11 all in sente. 

In terms of moves remaining you've still got D2, something to handle N15 - perhaps O13? and O3.]
;B[gj]C[--

It's interesting that white got four small corners yet still lost the game / even after komi.  Throughout the whole game both scores were very low with both low actual points and only small moyos.

Also I think it's interesting that your big territory was at the top where the initial weakness was.  

I think the final position makes it very clear that the reduction you got to K15 is much smaller than the reduction white got to Q11 - sometimes pushing into your opponent's territory isn't worth it.

Finally it's interesting that despite white getting unconditional life around C17 you still won - there were a number of sequences that went really very badly for your opponent.]
