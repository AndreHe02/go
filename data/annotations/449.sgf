This game is commented by Nicklas Ekstrand (Tramsigt, 16k,  on IGS).]

C[For a beginner I guess the 5-4 point is a though opening. Look at the Joseki dictionary a see why you use the 5-4 point. I would have played A(D10) or maybe B(D11). But you never know on a small board...
With this move white is looking for an extension and attack to the right.]
WL[2391];B[ce]C[This is not standard Joseki. But that might not be that important on a small board.]
BL[2384];W[de]LB[cd:A]C[White should consider securing the corner with A(C10). This D9 does not do anything.]

(;W[fj]LB[hd:A][fk:B]C[You are loosing moves by attacking and touching...don't touch while attacking. Consider making the extension A(H10). A lower play at B(F3) would only help black.]
WL[2294];B[fk]BL[2327];W[ek]WL[2274];B[gc]LB[gd:A]C[Black extension seems dangourus since the strength in the white wall. Consider A (G10) instead. Black will not be able to connect with upper left group anyway. By this move white looses the possibility to exented to the right.]
BL[2301];W[fb]C[I can't say that this is a bad move. But white will not get any territory from it nor securing the group. This might be a move that differs stronger players from weaker.]
WL[2257];B[fi]BL[2273];W[ej]C[Now white is strong and black is weak in the lower battle. But can white get around?]
WL[2248];B[eh]LB[dg:A][dh:B][ef:C]C[

White is here in trouble. He is almost cut off from the right side. There is the 3-3 invasion points, but is it enough? Black is however still weak with a lot of cutting points. Upper white group could also be in trouble. As white I would have played A(D7) or maybe B(D6) or C(E8). See variation.  Now the slowness of the F12 move is obvious.]

This is easy for black to survive. If you consider invading look at any of the A-F points. But most of these will only strengthen weak black group at G4. Look at variation for an 3-3 invasion.]
