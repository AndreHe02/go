[ae][ad][ac][ab][aa]C[Andrew,

Overall, you played well and experienced many of the problems common to your level.  If you would look to anything in the future, you may want to concentrate on the following points for your next few games:

1.  Don't attach to single stones.  You can often exert much more influence on a single stone by attacking it from a one point jump away.
2.  Learn strong and weak extensions.  (see http://senseis.xmp.net/?ExtendingFromASingleStone and http://senseis.xmp.net/?Extensions for some good tips.)
3.  Play big points first (enclose large territories and cut into your opponent's territories before playing small stuff in the middle.)
