C[This is a game i played on TOM as a 6 kyu, i've made some pretty stupid mistakes, but please give me some tips on opening directions, thx for looking at my game.

J: Hello, Michael. I am Joe and I will be marking my comments with a 'J:'. I am roughly 2d AGA. If you have any questions regarding this review that I didn't answer, please feel free to contact me at "schmee007@yahoo.com".]
;B[pd];W[pq]C[J: In the book, "The Direction of Play" the author goes into detail on why this is a game losing move. :)
I don't see a problem using this in an amature game, though.]
;B[do];W[ce];B[dc]
(;W[ee]TR[fd]C[uhh.. i think this was a very passive move...

J: I don't know of a joseki where white plays here. F16 seems to be a natural point for black to play here next to avoid getting pressed into a low position.

See joseki variations on the move prior.];B[ch]C[J: This feels too aggressive by black. The corner should be helped first.]
;W[ec];B[bf]
(;W[dd]C[J: I am not sure the best move here, but this still leaves D17 with a lot of aji as you soon see.]
;B[cc];W[bd]C[J: This move should be at B15 if you want to stop the connection. This point seems to put more pressure on the corner, but it leaves your shape weaker.

A black move at B17 later threatens to connect again.];B[eb]
;W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[bc]C[J: White had the first move in this corner and now  has nothing. Black's corner is alive, and B14 can connect later to the corner.]
;W[nc]C[a lot of territory for black, black takes the lead

J: This is the wrong direction to approach this stone. Since you are undercut from the left, getting territory here will be hard.

Better to approach from R14 side to try to develop the right side.]
;B[qf];W[pc];B[qc]
(;W[od]C[J: This move does not seem to have any good continuations here.]
;B[pb]
(;W[oc];B[pe]C[J: White has ugly shape, while black is sitting very well.]
;W[gb]C[J: There are still a lot of large opening plays left. Taking time to play a gote move to seal your skirt is hard at this point.

This does strengthen your upper right a bit, but again it was a mistake in direction there.]
;B[pn];W[qo];B[qn];W[po];B[ro];W[on];B[om];W[rp];B[nn];W[oo]
;B[rm]C[painful for white i think..

J: Locally, white gets a big corner. O14 is becoming a large point between 2 moyos.]
;W[oj]C[J: You are in a big hurry to reduce. 

It would be better to play a pivot point at O14. That way you can increase your own moyo while reducing your opponents.

A move by black at O14 would both threaten your moyo at the top and threaten this P10 stone.]

(;B[pi];W[oi];B[pj];W[oh];B[ph];W[pk];B[pl];W[ol];B[qk];W[nm]
;B[pm];W[ok]C[should i have connected at o8 here?

J: This is fine. You have made a near perfect wall. Black needs to play around J4 to cancel this soon.]
;B[dq];W[bn]C[J: This seems a hard place to invade. You have a nice wall, I would try to use that first. Maybe a play at J3?]
;B[cm];W[cn];B[dn];W[dm]
(;B[hk]C[J: This seems odd timing. C8 feels like a must.];W[cp]
C[J: A play at C8 should secure life. I would take that first.]
;B[cl];W[em];B[fn];W[dp];B[ep];W[eo];B[en];W[eq];B[fp];W[cq]
;B[fq];W[ip]C[J: Black is becomming very strong here. You should probably hold this back a line to K4.]
;B[er]C[lost first hand already..];W[cr];B[kp]
(;W[kq];B[lq];W[lp]C[J: This attachment and cross-cut leave black with all the territory he needs. It will be an easy game for black.]
;B[ko];W[mq];B[jq];W[lr];B[iq];W[mn]C[J: This stone is small.]

(;B[lm];W[fh]C[trying to invade the big black territory in the middle..

J: And you also increase your own moyo at the same time. This seems to be a fine point.]
;B[ei];W[fi];B[fj];W[gj];B[fk];W[gk];B[gl];W[eh];B[di]
(;W[jk]C[this i think was the game loser..

J: A simple push at H10 would be a better way to seal off the center. Your moyo is still open to a reduction from O14.

After this move, black has no problem entering your moyo, which was your last chance for points.]

I know i've got some big stuff i need to work on, especially during mid-game, please give me some tips on this game, thx.

J: You had a poor opening, but you nearly caught up when your opponent spent the rest of the game solidifying his territory. 
There were a few points where you could have attacked and developed your own position at the same time. If you were able to catch these points, then your opponent will be forced to respond.

Thank you for this game, I enjoyed the review.])
