;B[pp];W[dp];B[pc];W[dc];B[pi];W[qn]C[As you play more, you will see that this move is a relatively common corner approach.]

(;B[mp]C[This,
however, is not all that common. N4 is a little too far from Q4 to be effective
in protecting your corner. [See variations\]];W[qk]
(;B[rj]C[This move seems a little odd. [See variations\]];W[ok]
;B[ni]C[This
move seems a little slow. White lives so you're not making him run, and you
also have to consider that your upper right is not secure yet. You could
also choose to play on the left like in the previous variations.]

(;B[oe]C[Contact
moves aren't always preferred. Sometimes it is better to attack at a distance.
Notice the upper right is still vulnerable, but also that the Q11 group is
at risk now. Usually when there are two weak groups in an area, one dies.
Try to keep this in mind and take in a whole board perspective when choosing
moves. [See variation\]];W[of]
(;B[ne]C[Yes, a cut here might be preferred. [See variation\]]

(;B[od]C[Black's
shape here with the P15 stones is called an empty triangle. This is generally
a weak shape to make and is not preferred. [See variation\]]

E5, black is a little vulnerable to cuts later on, and I think a move such
as K4 is much larger in this situation. [See variations\]];W[mj]

;W[kp];B[lr]C[This
move at M2 leaves M2 and K3 open to a a possible cut later on. I think this
is why it's better to play a little closer to your group here, since white
still would not have a base.];W[kr];B[jr];W[lo];B[lq];W[ks]

seems a little small here. I think  jump out from your bottom group might
be better, and take off pressure from white trying to force you to live in
a smaller space later on. [See variation\]];W[jp];B[ip];W[io]

move is not well equipped to handle either G18 or O18. [See variation\]]

is a good move, thinking about breaking up the left side, but also consider
something such as C11. [See variation\]];W[ci];B[cg];W[bf]

H18/G17. Something like J16 might be preferred to stop white. [See variation\]]

the empty triangle shape here. Also, look at your groups for a second. O14

some eye space. Keep this in mind.];W[hb];B[jf];W[je];B[kd]

[hs][is]C[I
think it's good to remember the whole board perspective when playing a game
such as this, and not getting caught up in local battles so much. Try to
read ahead and see if your group can live. If the group can live, then tenuki
[move elsewhere instead of responding to your opponent's move\]. This includes
thinking on a large-scale [the biggest moves\] and also any weaknesses that
you can threaten in your opponent's shape. Also, remember about the empty
triangle, and how that it is usually an ineffective shape. Try to find moves
that do more than one thing, such as build your moyo and seperate your opponent,
strengthening your stones while threatening your opponent's stones, etc.
Those are very good moves. Overall, this was not such a bad game, since your
opponent was obviously much stronger than 25k. Try and keep those points
above in mind, and hopefully your game will improve soon.])

white must protect the cut, and black gains sente [with P1\] As you can see,
some moves are good, but they must always be considered in order of importance,
and when they will be most effective.]))
(;B[fl]C[I think this would
be much better for black. It's okay to sacrifice stones, and I think that
the two black ones in white's territory right now are a lost cause. Just
try and block white from eating anymore territory, and probably adding to
lost stones.];W[fm]))

moyo in the upper center part of the board, and also forces F18.]
