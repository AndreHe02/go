C[JH: Hello!

Thank you for spending some time analyzing my game. I am sure that some advices could make my game stronger.

I added some questions. It would be great if you could answer them. If you have time to look at the other moves - even better.

I played Black in this game.

Thanks again, Jorg.

TH: How did black manage to loose this game! White made weak groups everywhere. White should have been totally destroyed!

The answer is that black never really attacked. If you don't have any weak groups yourself then there is no excuse for not attacking. And you don't have to do anything deaparate like kill your opponent. Just look for attacking moves that build up your own position. "Make territory whilst attacking." That is enough to win.

Of course if you like that sort of thing then it is perfectly reasonable to go all out with splitting attacks and leaning attacks and it is quite likely that you will be able to kill something and win by a lot.


How to attack well is not something that can be explained in a few sentences. Here are some useful principles for attacking (roughly in order of most important first).

* Chase the opponent towards your thickness.

* Make territory whilst attacking.

* Keep your opponents weak groups separated.

* Attack by playing vital points (e.g. the cap, the knight's move, the angle point, etc.)

* Use forcing moves to destroy your opponent's shape.

* Don't plan to actually kill your opponent. Make sure that if he lives your surrounding groups are still quite strong. Of course if your opponent dies then that is an added bonus.

* Don't play unnecessary forcing moves.

The only way to learn when these principles mean and how to apply them is to try them in you own games (and make lots of mistakes, so you get you games reviewed, and then you play some more games, and make some different mistakes, and so on.)]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dq];B[do];W[dm];B[fo];W[fq]
(;B[ck]C[JH: Where would you have played?

TH: Good question. I hate close pincers.

Your plan here is generally good. One answer to a pincer is the "jump out and play a counter pincer" plan. This is what you are doinbg here. It is good becuase on the black stone in the top left corner.

Question 1) Should you play at the 3-3 point before playing the counter pincer? (See variation)

Question 2) Where exactly should you play the counter pincer? This is also hard to answer.   One proverb I have seen is that you should play a pincer one space away from your opponent for each stone in his wall. So a single stone you pincer one space away, a two stone wall you pincer two spaces away and so on. However in this position it is not that simple. It looks as if white has a single stone, but really it is a 2 stone wall. The reason for this is that if whit jumps out to F7 then black would like to answer it with a jump to H7. After that white really has a 2-stone wall, and so black would like the pincer stone one space further away.

The other question is do you play on the third line or the 4th? With the two 4-4 point at the top it looks to me like black is playing for influence, so playing on the 4th line might be more consistent, but it is just a mater of taste.

So in summary I would play at D10, but more or less any more round here is good.]
;W[fm];B[cm]C[JH: trying to connect...

TH: Nice idea but the problam is that you are playing in contact with stones you should be attacking. White ought to be able to find a counter attack.]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[cl]C[This is a mistake by white because ... (see variation)]

(;B[bm]C[TH: There is a better move for black. See the variation.]
;W[co]
(;B[cp];W[dl];B[bl]
(;W[cq];B[bp];W[bq]
(;B[ho]C[JH: reviewing that game, I found that this move was bad. The black group is not in immediate danger, so it is not necessary to run away. This only strengthens White. Am I right? Where is the best alternative?

TH: The key feature of this position is the weak white group in the middle. I think that black should attack it. It looks better to attack from the other direction, hoping to build a moyo in the top left corner.

This move mighe be a bit thin?]
(;W[hp]C[THis is a very dangerous idea for white. Black should welcome the oppostunity to get stronger in the middle then really attack the white group in the middle.]

(;B[qn]C[TH: It is much more urgent to play near the weak group.]
;W[qo]C[TH: This is just a mistake. This sort of attachment is only correct if there is a white stone at or near Q10.]
;B[pn];W[mp]C[TH: This is very thin. Black P4 might be interesting one day.]
;B[qj]C[TH: Black gets an ideal 3-space extension. That is why white's move at R5 was wrong.]

(;W[pg]C[JH: how to react to that move?

TH: Giggle quietly to yourself :-)

I don't see how this move helps white build anything (other than a weak group). This area of the board is a black area of strength. White should play in an area where there is more space to develop. So black does not need to do anything clever.]
;B[md]C[TH: Good answer. The 1 point jump to O16 would also be good.]
;W[hd];B[dk]C[At last the attack comes. Good.];W[fl]
(;B[gc]C[JH: maybe from the other side?

TH: I think that you should continue to attack in the middle.   The other side is probably better because there is more space for white to make eyes there. This move is a bit too close to a stone you wish to attack.]
;W[kd];B[hc];W[ic];B[lf];W[qd]C[TH: It looks like white is trying to make a lot of dead groups.]

(;B[qc]C[TH: This is the wrong direction.];W[qe];B[rc];W[qi]
;B[pj]C[TH: In this position I would try answering the contact move with a hane to stir things up a bit and to make it harder for white to live.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[oh];B[ni];W[rj];B[rk];W[ri];B[ql]C[TH: This is not really necessary. It is massively overconcentrated. There are much better moves, attack in the middle, attack at the top, invade the bottom, ...]
;W[le];B[me];W[kf];B[sf]C[JH: I tried to take away the base from the white group. But maybe it would have been better to play M13 first?

TH: Yes, or N14 might be even better (better shape).];W[nh]

(;B[op]C[JH: N12 first?

TH: That would probably be more interesting. You should certainly be trying to attack one of the 3 weak groups in the centre.

N12 is a good move because it tries to shut white in. That is always a good thing to do, strategically, becuase then white has to spend moves making two eyes whilst you get territory and thickness.

However locally this is a good move.];W[oq]
(;B[po]C[There are much more interesting possibilities for this move. See the variations. They will all get a bit messy and will involve black sacrificing something in order to break up white's formation. This is not risky because the black group around R8 is very strong so you can attack freely without worrying about a counter-attack.]
;W[qp];B[mn]C[Blakc has just played a rather crude sequence which has probably helped white more than it has helped black. See the variations for moves 59 and 61.]
;W[io];B[hn];W[oj]C[TH: I can't believe that white is making another weak group!]
;B[nj];W[dg]C[TH: O.K., he isn't, or at least he is making the 4th weak group on the left instead.]

(;B[fg]C[JH: I didnt't knew what to do...

Maybe a leaning attack at E12, then attack the white group around F8, F7??

What do you suggest?   TH: Well you are right to try and attack.   During the attack it is important to keep the various white groups separated. If yu do, there are so many of them that at least one is quite likely to die. So your move is certainly very good.   As for what is best? I really couldn't say.   I don't really like E12 because it general it is quite difficult to lean on a single stone. A sigle stone can be quite weak and leaning on it will only make it stronger.

The white group around L16 is weak, but has reasonable shape so you are unlikely to be able to kill it. Therefore it might be better to lean on that. However it is hard to find good leaning moves.   The white group around F8 has virtually no eye-shape, but it can either run in the direction of F10 or H8. So again you are unlikely to kill it, but you can lean on it effectively with a move like F10.

So there are lots of good ideas, all of which are worth trying. I have shown one variation.]
;W[ek]C[TH: This is a vital shape point, locally, someone really should have played in this part of the board sooner.]
;B[lp]C[TH: No. Keep up the attack on all of the weak white groups. This part fo the board isn't nearly so interesting.]
;W[lq];B[kp];W[kq];B[mq];W[nq];B[jq];W[mr];B[ip];W[iq];B[jp]
;W[hq];B[jm]C[TH: This is a totally unnecessary move.

Black is so strong in this area that if white tries to escape with this stone it will just end up dead. If you really must defend then you should play a more large scale move like H8 which makes a much bigger area of territory whilst making it impossible for this white stone to escape.

But of course black really should be attacking some of the weak white groups. Black should not have ignored the white move at E9. A response to that, for example D11, would be a good move now.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[di]
(;B[ci]C[TH: This move is bad shape. It makes C12 into a brilliant move for white. You just can't play this move. You would like to play C12 yourself, but you can't, so you will just have to tenuki, and hope that something will work later.]
;W[ch]C[TH: White links up two of his weak groups whilst making good shape. This is a disaster for black.

Except that white isn't properly linked up. The cut at E10 seems to be possible. Black must play there now.

(The unofficial proverb of the Cambridge Go Club is "Cut first, think later." This is often a recipe for disaster, but in positions like this it is exactly right.)]
;B[bh]C[TH: This is a bad move. It ends in gote, (or doesn't achieve anything at all) and having sente is important at the moment.]
;W[bg];B[bi]C[TH: Simmilarly this move should not have been played. Take sente instead.]
;W[ce];B[cd]C[JH: White got a lot out of his invasion. :-(

TH: Yes, you needed to find a way to fight back.

By the way, did you even consder ignoring white's last move? Actually you were probably right to answer it becuase you secure a lot of corner territory. White's last move was a bad one because there were much better possibilities in the corner (C17, C16, B16, etc.).]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[lh];B[eh]C[TH: Good.]
(;W[dh]
(;B[lj]C[TH: Except that black should now cut at E10 and give white something to worry about.

This is a fairly small territorial move.   If only the ladder worked L13 would be a good way to start an attack, splitting apart the two weak groups. (See variation.)]
;W[fe];B[ed];W[bd];B[bc];W[be];B[cb]C[TH: This is just an endgame move. It is much too small to play now.]
;W[mf]C[TH: Now two more of the white groups are safe. The only interesting thing left for black is the cut at E10.]

(;B[hh]C[JH: To slow?   TH: Possibly. This move threatens to rescue the black stone at M14, but in fact white can allow that because if black tries to escape there is a good squeeze. (See the variation).]
;W[jj];B[ki]C[TH: Good.];W[jl];B[kl]C[JH: I tried to defend, but maybe a play around H8 would have been better?

TH: You need to count the game. If you think that you can play defensively and play out the endgame and win then that is fine. If you are behind on territory then you need to attack and you have just been given the perfect opportunity.

You can probably play H8 (or H9) and a few subsequent moves in sente (white will have to answer to make sure that his stones can connect out, so you can always decide whether to defend or not later.

JH: That was my last question. It would be great if you have time to have a fast look at the endgame, too.

TH: In this position there seem to be three really big endgame sequences:

Black S5, white S4, black S6 - 10 points gote,
Black J2, white H2, black K2 - 12 points gote,
Black J18, white K17, black M18 - hard to count but probably a lot bigger. Also gote.]
;W[kk];B[lk]C[TH: It might be safer (and better shape) to play M8.]
;W[km]
(;B[lm]C[TH: Oops.];W[ll];B[ml];W[im];B[in]C[All this in the middle is quite small. Tenuki and take a big point.]

;W[sg];B[rf];W[rg];B[qf];W[pf];B[sd];W[se];B[re];W[rd];B[se]
C[TH: In this sort of position, where you need to make several connections, you should always start to connect from the 'safe' end first. In other words you should play T17. The main reason for this is that it makes R13 a smaller ko threat for white.]
;W[hb]C[TH: I believe that it is better for white to play J18 (white then ends in sente).]
;B[gb];W[ha]C[This is a mistake. White should just play J18.]
;B[ib];W[jb]
(;B[ga]C[TH: If you were going to play this move then you should not have sacrificed the stone at J18. Actually you had a better move.]

In this case you got good solid territory in the top left, and the opportunity to build thickness in the middle so you can have a good go at killing white on the right. The white group at the bottom is still weak. If black plays J6 then it seems to be quite seriously surrounded by black thickness. Where could it run to? where could it make eyes? Even if it did live, whilst it was doing so black would probably be able to break up the area in the middle of the bottom.]
