;W[dj];B[cg];W[ci];B[bd];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb];B[de]C[Q: This struck me as odd - was there a better response?

Y: w can sente c16, but i you cannot hane in sente later on.  Your response is a solid move.]

Y: Hmm, w is very strong here.  I'm eager to see what happened.  So far w is play very good moves.  b on the other hand is quite provoking.  I think it's his style.  In this case I would simply play patient normal moves.]
;B[ah];W[jc]C[Y: Good move.];B[mc]C[Y: B's in too deep.];W[oc]

;B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rn];B[rm];W[ro];B[rs];W[sq];B[sn]C[Q: What did I do wrong?  This should have lived easily, no?

Y: Ah live and death problem.  S1 was the key.  You didn't have to play s6 or s5.  Simply S1 and you are alive.  Also leave S6 along because now your R10 group is weakened.  R10 group is important because B has 3 weak stones on your strong side.]

;B[oe];W[hd]C[Q: Was this good?  It felt small, but I felt that I needed to secure some territory.

Y:  White is still not alive down at bottom right.  I would m7 insead.  Center is quite attractive.]

;W[lg];B[mg];W[lh];B[nq];W[jh]C[Y: Waste move.  P4 miai.  Should h3 or r15 or something like that.]
;B[le];W[bf];B[be];W[bg];B[ch];W[cf];B[df];W[ac]C[Y: wow, w so close to kill with D13.  w has a lot of chances in the game, but because of the live and death problem at the bottom, all the advantages it had early in the game didn't materialize.]
;B[af];W[ad];B[ae];W[ab]C[Q: In retrospect, I think this was a huge mistake.  I should have played E11, which would have given me a seki at worst.  Was I right in trying to kill that group, though?

Y: there is no way you can kill B here without E11.];B[di];W[ej]
