C[Hi,

This is your reviewer, Wonodan from KGS.

[qj:6][qk:7][ql:8][qm:9][qn:10][qo:11][qp:12]C[There are twelve spaces between black top formation and black bottom stone.

If you want to split the right side, the most logical spot is right in the middle.]
(;W[qi]C[This invasion is not in a good spot, it's slightly too close to the top right black formation.]
;B[qk];W[qf]C[Locally, the white shape does not have two eyes yet.

The two space extension on the 3rd line however, is perfect.]
;B[qn]
(;W[oe]LB[pe:B][pf:A]C[The knight's move is for attacking, and leaves two cuts at A and B.]
;B[co]LB[dd:B][ck:1][dk:2][cl:3][dl:4][cm:5][dm:6][dq:A]C[When you have a 3-4 stone (A) and a star stone (B) on the opposing side supporting the 3-4 stone, it's usually best to pincer.

All the moves from 1 to 6 are white's available pincers on the black approaching stone.]
;W[ep]C[This move let's black settle his stone very easily, and is tame, because it has no follow-up.]
;B[cl]LB[dd::-(]C[After black has defended, the D16 stone looks like it's lost a lot of it's potential.]
;W[iq];B[fc];W[cf]LB[df:A]C[You played the correct move to defend here.

Since black has stones waiting for your defending move, this is better than the high move at A, for example.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[ic]SQ[db][fc][oc]C[Black's joseki choice looks boring, as all of his stones at the upper side are low.]
;W[cj]LB[ci:A][bq:B]C[The joseki move for white is at C11 (A), but this is certainly more interesting, as it puts some pressure on the two black stones.

The problem here is that black can always slide to B, so he was never in trouble.]
;B[bq]LB[ch:A]C[Black played as expected.

Now that black has strenghtened his position, the invasion at A becomes more threatening.]
(;W[cr]C[Your bottom group is more or less safe, so defending here is not necessary.

This move does not threaten the three black stones either.

It would've been more useful to play it elsewhere.];B[br]
(;W[lc]LB[db:A][fc:A][ic:A][oc:B][qd:B]C[When you invade, you split your opponent into two parts, and get a weak group to burden your game.

An invasion is successful, when one or both of the cut opposing groups are weak.

In this case, groups A and B are strong.

After this invasion, how did you plan to attack either of them?

I think it's white who's going to get in trouble after this invasion.]

;B[mi];W[ni];B[mj];W[jd];B[he]C[As we can see from the result, invading and trying to split two strong groups can be harder than it first seems. : - )

It is white's group in the middle that is under attack and surrounded, instead of the split black groups!]
;W[gd]C[When you play a move, make sure it works!];B[id]C[You can't lose confidence and let black get everything.]

;W[pc];B[pd];W[qc];B[rc];W[rd]LB[pb:A][qb:B]C[This is a weird move, as black can capture the two white cutting stones with either A or B.]

(;W[gc]LB[fc:A][ic:B]C[Continue your attack!

Now black is split into two groups, your move was a threat!]
))
(;W[lq]C[Instead of invading, you could've thought about extending along the bottom, as it's the biggest open area.]
))
(;W[ej]LB[ch:A]C[So normally white would defend against the invasion at A like this.]
))
(;W[of]C[The one point jump is a defending move.

In a normal case cutting it is hard, or cutting it gives the person being cut a better outcome.

This is the move to use here.]))
(;W[qj];B[ql];W[qg]TR[qe][qf]C[After black attacks with R8, your group still has two spaces from the black formation at the top, so it's more safe.]
