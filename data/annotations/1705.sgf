black wins (white resigns).

mikke: White problem in this game is that he have too many weak groups at the same time. Black plays well, above his strength, I think.]

;W[en];B[dm];W[dn];B[fl];W[gn];B[ej];W[pn]C[mikke: I would have answered E10. Maybe F10 is good.]
;B[np]C[alain : wK3 does not feel right. wQ10 instead better ?

mikke: R4 is the proper continuation after Q6];W[jq]C[mikke: K3 introduce a new weak group which is normaly not good when its other weak groups to attend. Here the weak group D6 is close and black can easily launch a double attack.]
;B[lq];W[pj]C[mikke: I would have defended K3 somehow. Maybe H3 is good enough.]
;B[pe];W[qg]C[mikke: This is whites first real misstake. White must play r15.]
;B[qe];W[hc]C[mikke: once again making a black double attack possible.]
;B[gf]C[mikke: The idea is right but I think black should play L17 to force the two white groupes closer and then cut.]
;W[kc];B[id]C[mikke: this is blacks first real misstake this move have no real meaning.]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[di];B[dj];W[cj]C[mikke: just C12 is better];B[ck]
;W[ch];B[bi];W[bh];B[bj];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[rq]C[alain : wO6 looked very interesting but maybe wG3 instead is better because it looks urgent (var2)

mikke: yes, it is more urgent to attend the two weak white groups.]

(;W[nn]C[mikke: O6 helps the weak groups a litte so it's not all bad.]
;B[jo]C[alain : wH4 looks dubious maybe wJ5 is better ?

mikke: black should try to separate white K5 misses that goal a little.]

(;W[hp]C[mikke: hard to say H4 looks possible. This is a hard fight for white.]
