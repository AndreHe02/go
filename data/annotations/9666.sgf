C[White made some mistakes and you made some good decisions. In general you have a good spirit. You don't let yourself be led around the board, you're not afraid to go play away from where your opponent wants to play, and you are able to fight back instead of defending. You don't yet know when it's okay to leave an area alone, and when it's too dangerous, and as a result you are sometimes leaving bad positions behind. 

Your opponent's main mistake was to be too greedy. He constantly tried to damage your position rather than secure his own. He built a lot of weak groups that he had to worry about.]
;B[jd];W[dj];B[kj];W[dc];B[hk];W[kc]C[Playing a 3-3 invasion in the opening isn't unheard of but it's rare and often a bad idea. What it does is to trade corner territory against a wall on the outside. The invader takes a small, safe territory in the corner. But that territory ends up being isolated and encircled.Int the opening you want to expand, to advance on the board.You need space to do that. The cramped corner territory of your opponent won't have much potential for expansion.

That move is about to give you a big advantage and it will take quite some work for white to recover.]
;B[kd]C[Good decision from you to play here, giving you a wall that faces your stones at the bottom.]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb];B[gc]
(;W[gb]C[The normal way to play here would be for white to play at M10 to finish making a living group in the corner. Instead white decided to continue on the side probably with the idea to connect to its corner stone. But the result is that instead of taking a sizeable corner, white is crawling on the second line, making very little territory. The aim to play in the corner is to take territory, so this is a bad trade for white. You, in the mean time, have got a black wall that already dominates the board and works nicely with your two stones at the bottom right. Whit has put himself in a bad position.]

(;B[fc];W[eb]
(;B[fb]C[This move is small. Pushing here doesn't help you much compared to other moves you can make. For example M11 or M10 are good as they also prevent white from pushing there. Advancing on the bottom is also possible.]
;W[dg];B[gf];W[jh]TR[jk][ld]C[The decision to invade I believe is correct. White is at a disadvantage and playing defensively will allow you to secure a huge area. However I wouldn't chose this spot if I were white. It's too high for an invasion, too deep for a reduction. When you invade, getting a safe base to live is very important. For this one needs to be closer to the egde, on the third line. Playing high like this means your plan is to run away and connect to your other stones, but here, because of the black stones at G7 and G3, it's not hard for black to cut the escape route. White's best bet is to live inside so he should play on the third line.
This doesn't mean that this stone is no threat, though. There are several weak areas (triangles) in your position that white can use to his advantage.]
;B[de]C[As reduction go, this is a good one. It's cutting the white stones appart and the two white stones at E12 who where already much weakened by your black wall now need help. Also answering to an attack by another attack allows you to keep the initiative. However you have to be careful of what you give and take. When you do that you allow your opponent a second move in the undefended area. What you take should be of equivalent value to what you might lose. Here I think allowing white G6 is too painful.]
;W[ef];B[ee];W[gh];B[ii]C[You're just asking him politely to connect his stones. If you want to cut, cut right away. If you're not going to cut, don't play there at all.
If you're trying to defend your territory, that move is too high. The corner can still be invaded. A stone at K4 would make it safe. and prevent white to make damage here.

Here, as white I'd have connected, making my stones stronger and ready to destroy your prospective territory on the right side.]

(;W[ji]C[Now that's just asking for trouble.Those stones can't be cut like this. The only point of this is to force you to reinforce your corner, basically making it yours instead of the loose, invadable area it was a moment ago.
White is helping you secure territory and make a stronger base you can use to counter-attack.]
;B[jj]C[Now your corner is safe, and the two white stones aren't.]
;W[ki]C[This is called an empty corner. it's considered a bad move in most cases because of its lack of efficiency. That move achieves too little in a situation where the white stones lack either a connection or space to make eyes.]
;B[ga]C[It's too early to make this sort of move. Unless white makes a mistake, his group in the corner will live, so cutting isn't of a huge benefit here. There are much more important areas to fight for on the board. The right side is urgent. Look at how many stones you have in that area: this big black wall is in danger of becoming useless if you don't use it to fight back the invasion on the right side.

The bottom is still quite big (E3) but not urgent and and on the left side you also have the prospect of destroying some potential white territory.

All of those are much more important than playing G13.];W[ha]

(;B[fa];W[ja]
(;B[ff]C[No, this doesn't help you. The two stones at E9 also have the wall at F11 to run to. They're not your concern now. You should be trying to cut off the K5 stones or prevent them to make a base.]
;W[ld]C[This move is big. Not only does it grind on your area, it also threatens a connection with the isolated whote stones.]
;B[le];W[lc];B[cc]C[Here you are trying to take this corner.]

(;W[cd]
(;B[ce]C[Don't abandon so readily a stone you just played. You make that move useless and allow your opponent to take the corner you were trying to gain. If a cause is lost you have to cut your losses of course, but here white has a pretty weak position.]

;W[jg];B[ig];W[lj];B[lk];W[mi];B[fk];W[hj]C[At this point your territory and whit's is about the same. White successfully invaded the right side. You have one corner left and a few points in the middle.
This has left you with a strong center group that you can use to attack, though. White has good prospects ont the bottom left, but the area is still wide open. Making it white territory by playing a move to defend the corner would be a good idea now.
White is being too greedy by pushing you here.];B[gj]C[Leaving that cut at J4 open cost you later in the game.You can simply connect. Middle areas take a lot of effort to secure and even if white plays another move here, he won't be making much points. Securing your position then moving on to the corner and the left side should be your focus.]

;W[el];B[dk];W[dl];B[ck]TR[hj][kk][hi]C[You're having the right ideas of fighting back and keeping white weak and cut off. But you need to be careful here as your defence still has a lot of holes. Stones that look dead can become troublesome when you start running out of liberties.]
