AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I am 14k on KGS. This person that I am playing against does not have a rank yet, but he's guessing he's about 18k, so I gave a 4-stone handicap.
Hi Chan,  Yes your opponent was very weak in this game, and you had good luck. You managed to get away with some moves which would not work against stronger players, I have indicated those in the review.  Generally in handicap games you need to spread your stones out in a more diffusive manner.  Other styles of handicap play are possible, but this is the most popular way.  In your game here, you ignored the top right corner completely, which you cannot afford to do in a handicap game.  Also you made a lot of helping moves, which just allowed black to settle and make territory.  You were very fortunate that black was so weak that his positions on the left hand side collapsed at the end of the game.

If you have any questions about any of the points, then either send me an e-mail or chat to me on KGS, login dch888.

Regards,
David.];W[jd];B[ph];W[fc]C[I am not sure if this is the right approach. I don't play handicap game often.
It's fine.];B[df]C[More usual to finish your shape by playing around O17.]
(;W[qn]C[Would F14 be better here?  
F14 looks too overconcentrated.  I like the play in the game better.  F14 attempts to make territory in the centre which usually looks bigger than it is.]
(;B[qk];W[qq]C[Is this the right approach? It's ok.  Playing a pincer move at O3 seems to be a more common choice of Joeski in handicap games.]
;B[pn];W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[oq];W[pr]C[too small ... you need to tennuki, your group is alive.]
;B[or];W[jp];B[lp];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dm];W[fm];B[ej];W[el]
C[bad, helps black.  you can think here about many other alternatives.  O17 is a simple play, for example.]
;B[dl];W[dn]C[This move was really to me... but it seems to be better than at E6?  
Seems like an overplay.  black should either be able to capture this stone, or just reinforce his territory with C6 which is what he played.  Therefore this is a bad move since it just helps black.  If anything in this area then a deep invasion around B4 would be more profitable, although risky. E6 is worse since it helps black make even more territory as he would play D6. As far as the whole board goes, it looks to me like O17 is about the best spot since it's a mutual point and makes good shape and a decent amount of potential territory.]
;B[cn];W[en];B[md]C[now black takes the mutual point which ideally white would have liked.  you are still a long way behind on territory.]
;W[dk]C[same kind of comments as before.  this is worse now since black is slightly stronger, so he should cut and capture this stone.]
;B[dj];W[ck];B[ge]C[you were very lucky black didn't cut, now you must connect at E9, as this has the potential to reduce black considerably.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[gk];W[fj]C[you seem to make this move a lot, black should just cut at F9, which would isolate your stone and make your move rather meaningless.  The biggest move on the board is connecting your stones at E9]
;B[fi];W[gj];B[kn];W[hj]C[Is this move too slow? since black has apparently abandonded g9 then your move helps further isolate this stone and gain central influence.  but yes, locally its ok but globally there are much bigger moves, e.g. R17]

perhaps you mean g12, h12 is no cut.];B[ef];W[fd];B[eh];W[gh]
