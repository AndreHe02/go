AB[pd][dp]C[Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for reading this game and taking some time to think about this. I am stuck at 7k for a while (maybe 1 year even if i dont play regularly, I would like you to advice me how to improve, especially regarding to this game which part of my play I should improve.

Thank you again.

comments and variations that I thought are marked in this game, I hope you can correct me if I am wrong.


===

There are a few key, fundamental points that occured in this game.

1) You tended to not make normal or conventional approached to white's corners, or responses to his approaches.
2) You had a small lack of solid shape when fighting broke out.
3) You also tended to lack the ability to count to see when you're ahead, and play solidly as a result to win the game.]
;W[po]LB[dd:C][pq:A][qq:B]
(;B[nq]C[===

This move is odd, you generally want to either fill the empty corner, or else do a more conventional approach. 

Especially when white's the stronger player, you will want to play more conventional moves.

See variations];W[qf];B[nc];W[pq];B[qm]C[===

Attacking like this seems a little unreasonable to me, as O3 is still weak. With O3 being weak, and R7 weak, white can split and attack both. Also, this induces white to secure his R14 stone, and if you go into the corner for R7's group, O3 will likely be hurt by it.]

Still, O8 a little more solid.];W[gp]LB[dn:A][jq:B]C[===

A very light approach, black's normal followups are at A or B.

A is probably best for black, as B is way too close to his own thickness]

(;B[gn]C[===

This move seems very odd, as black doesn't have a moyo yet on the left. Also, it's easy for white to wedge between, so maybe white just makes a solid group on the left.]
;W[jp]C[===

White is playing into black's moyo-building.];B[jn]C[yolka: it is probably ambitious since p5 is sente and black still will have some worries I felt that I would fully use the wall.

===

White can secure himself easily on bottom, and white can make a strong group on the left side, nullifying some of that influence.]

(;W[oh];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi];W[cd]LB[ec:B][fc:D][ed:A][fd:C]C[===

A and B normal approaches, C and D even.];B[df]C[===

Again, non-standard approach.

White can secure himself very simply on bottom, and in two ways, so white may even forgo securing the bottom until later.

This move is usually only reducing an existing framework (like when white has a stone near J16/17)]

(;W[in]C[===

This doesn't seem to be in white's best interests.];B[im];W[kn]

[kk][lk]C[===

This seems non-ideal, mostly because you're not trying to develop in the triangled area, as white currently has entry into it.

Also, white should just enter into the left side and make a strong group.]
;W[cf]C[===

White seems determined to secure your moyo for you. White cannot hope to win by playing like this.]
;B[cg];W[de];B[ef];W[cp];B[co];W[do]C[===

This is unreasonable by white, he's trying to take advantage of being the stronger fighter. Just play as simple and solid as you can, and back it up with good reading.]

(;B[dn];W[eo]C[===

This gives white a good 20 points on bottom and surrenders the corner, a very bad result for black. Probably most important, however, is the the G4 group is now huge, strong, and alive.]
;B[en];W[fo]
(;B[cm]C[===

The cut isn't the biggest concern for black right now. Read it out, count, and see that your middle moyo is much larger.]

(;B[jf]C[yolka: I later thought of this move and wait to see how white response. The problem is the defect of the shape around f17 white can slide below. I do believe that black is leading, but I have a fightinh spirit, that why in the game i went for a kill]
;W[gd]LB[kc:A][bp:B][kr:C]C[yolka: if black to ignore I believe that A is the biggest point since it make the F16 connection in sente, right ?
