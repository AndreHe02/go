RE[W+24.5]TM[1200]US[Brought to you by IGS];B[pd]C[This game is commented by Nicklas Ekstrand, swedish 4k.

Since both players made, as far as I can tell, a lot of mistakes I will focus on pointing out some of them.

I will also recommend a book that I read when my playing strength were about the same as for these players: Get Strong at Tesuji. Reason: improve the reading skill.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cn]C[For some reason many people will say that you should play F3 instead of C6...personally I have never figured out why.]
;W[fq]C[This is a very timid response. I would have played F4 or C8 instead.]

(;B[ck]C[Actually I think B should play B4 before C9. See variation.];W
[jp];B[mq]C[This looks like a good trade for B...or?];W[bo]C[This is a silly move...B could for example play Q10.]
;B[co]C[Do not do this! It has no purpose what so ever.];W[cp];B[bn];W[bp]
;B[cf];W[ch]C[I don't like this move. B should not have too much trouble taking care of that white stone.]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[di]C[This is, as far as I know, a joseki sequence...which will not work very well for W because of the C9 stone.

I would, however, play B16 instead...where should the white stone run to?]
;W[dg];B[df];W[eg];B[fg];W[eh];B[ei]C[Ooops, I don't like this move. I would play F12 instead, if W escapes B gets a very nice position in the centre.]
;W[fh];B[ff];W[gh];B[cc]C[This is a kind of move I've played many times, but it has never worked :(]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb]C[Wrong move...B16 instead.];W[fb];B[db]C[I think this position is dead for B. You could of course use it as a problem this practice life and death.]
;W[bd];B[bb];W[ac];B[ab];W[ea]C[Now B can live by C19.];B[hf]C[This is probably better than living small in the corner. The W G12 group is still not safe.]
;W[ca]C[Dead.];B[da]C[Still dead...no use to play here (W has to answer though)]
;W[ba];B[fa];W[gb];B[jd];W[gj]C[W has first move to escap and I feel helpless to stop him]
;B[ek]C[What's the purpose of this move? How about F6 instead?];W[gl];B
[pj]C[Good...B is getting all the big points and W has to start chasing again.]
;W[qm]C[This should be extremely good for B...either take profit above or below the W stone.

Another comment about W's line of playing. It is not possible to kill all your opponent stones or letting him live with 10 points in total. As far as I can tell W is only trying to reduce B as much as possible without thinking of where to make territory of his own.]
;B[qo];W[rj]C[W likes tricky moves...although it might not always be good.]
;B[qk]C[Ouch, you can't take profit everywhere. You should think of one of the following moves: S9, S11 and R11.]
;W[rk];B[ql]C[Terrible move.];W[rl];B[pm]C[B is getting the outside but W will have no problem to avoid B getting territory in the centre.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[qh];B[md];W[pc]C[Another tricky move by W.];B[oc]C[B is playing too friendly here...how about R17 instead?]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[ko]C[At this point...go back to move 63 (at N16)...B has three stones on line 16, but W is dispite that more territory on the upper side.

L5 seems good...it is time to take profit from the wall at the right side.]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[qq]C[W makes yet another overplay.];B[pq];W[ro];B[qp];W[rp]
;B[rn]C[?];W[rm];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[pr]C[Ouch, W should be able to read this one out.]
;B[or];W[kc];B[jc]C[Overplay again?];W[ld];B[kd]C[B, once again, is trying to capture W in one or two moves...that is not possible, play further away and make sure W cannot run to allied groups.]
;W[le];B[lc];W[me];B[nd];W[ne];B[hn]C[Oh...is this possible. It has some potentials since it maight make the life for the G12 group insecure.]
;W[jn];B[jm]C[But then you have to secure the H6 stone.];W[im];B[jl];W[il]
;B[fn];W[jk];B[kk];W[jj]C[W has some bad aji left.];B[kj];W[nj]C[This might be too deep...B should chase this stone against the N15 group and then kill that group :)]
;B[nk]C[How about P11?];W[mj];B[mk];W[oj];B[ok];W[oh];B[pi];W[ph];B[oi]
;W[mh];B[ni];W[mi];B[nh];W[ng];B[in]C[Good...B must try to take advantage of the aji in W's position now.]
;W[ki];B[hp];W[hr];B[iq];W[ir];B[jq];W[jr];B[kq];W[ig];B[ji];W[ij];B[if]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[kg];B[pa];W[qb];B[qa];W[rb];B[hc]C[Extremely good! The last hope for B...the W group has not two eyes yet and must thus kill the B group inside...this is very costly!]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[gc];B[hd];W[gd];B[ge];W[af];B[bi]C[NO! B13 is the only move! W still does not have two eyes in the corner!]
;W[bh];B[og]C[Ouch...it is for the moves like this you have to read "Get Strong at tesuji" :-)

I'm not sure about the possible profit from this move. How about playing Q14 first?]
;W[of];B[pg];W[pf];B[qg];W[qf];B[li];W[kh]C[This is, of course, wrong by white.]
;B[mg];W[rg];B[lh]C[Nice :-)];W[kr];B[lr];W[ci];B[bj];W[cj];B[dj];W[dl]
;B[cl];W[em];B[en];W[fm];B[dm];W[el];B[dk];W[od]C[Ouch...sente against N17.]
;B[mc];W[oe]C[Ouch...W lost 10p here? P15 is not necessary to play.];B[gm]
;W[fl];B[hl];W[hk];B[hm];W[ik]C[J9 is too small? W should play somewhere else.]

;W[bg];B[fj];W[tt];B[eo];W[eq]C[B made two huge mistakes and lost the game. W made too many overplays and tried to play tricky moves without any particular purpose (except for letting B play wrong).

B also lost the opportunity to chase weak W groups. The W group in upper left should have been isolated and it might have been very profitable for B.

A final note, when the opponent groups are weak do expect to kill them...just chase them and take as much profit as you can!   :-)]
