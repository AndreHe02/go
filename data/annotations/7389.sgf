(;B[nd]C[EFuzzy: Trying to claim some of the upper right corner

There is kind of a rule in the opening about the 3rd and 4th line. 3rd line is for territory and 4th line to develop your game. 
The most popular enclosure is the knight's move, but this is still good.]

(;B[cf]C[EFuzzy: Wanted to prevent white expansion downward from the upper left corner. Is this too aggressive?

not really but white might take the initiative with a pincer perhaps]

(;B[dh]C[EFuzzy: Supporting the stone at C14];W[ck];B[cn]C[EFuzzy: Solidifying C4 while limiting white territory on left.

this is good, becouse you attack the white group and encloses the corner at the same time. White doesnt have the space to settle]

This is a good move, becouse you attack and create a moyo at the same time. But q8 creates a better moyo.]

A and B are bigger, remember that moyos are usually Box-shaped and moyos are good]
;W[nj];B[nh]LB[cc:C][bd:B][bl:D][kq:A]C[too slow, try to take initiative with moves a little bit more aggressive, now is the time to attack after the opening is over.

;W[jp];B[nr];W[mr];B[ns];W[il]C[EFuzzy: How do I avoid getting my stones contained like they are on the right side?

well... they both hold many points, they are your strong groups, altough they are "contained" this doesnt necessary is a bad thing, you have to worry is about your weak groups, weather by connecting them to the strong ones or by settling them. They were your priority in the game, now its a little late.]

(;B[fh]LB[bd:A][bh:B]C[EFuzzy: I have to break white's control of the left center.

A or even B is bigger, becouse you have to settle first since you can't connect this group. Your priority is to live, then IF you can, you can think about reducing your enemy's territory.]

It's impossible to connect that group now, you can rather profit from it by playing moves like A,B,C. Becouse you reduce some points from him with sente. B being my personal choice.]

;W[hm];B[eo];W[fp];B[im]C[EFuzzy: Probably a bad move. Should've defended territory on Lower Left

Its a wasted move in fact, the semeai is won by W no questions about it, dont play moves like that becouse not only you lose sente, but also gives 1 more point to the enemy.]
