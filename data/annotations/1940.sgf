AB[gc][cg]C[In this game I'm playing Igowin at 4kuy strength. I win by 7 points in the end.   I am white.   Can I win my even more on this small board?]
;W[fg]C[Have to start somewhere and this seems more aggressive than the 3-3 point. I don't think the star point is appropriate since it leaves the corner vulnerable and building territory is very important in 9x9 games.]
;B[dc]
(;W[gd]TR[cg][dc]C[>Try to enclose and get ready for attack. I like this better than the variation.

I agree that F7 is worse, but I don't like this move either. Attaching like this will tend to make Black stronger, and it will tend to fix the shape early. I think in a two-stone game, White needs to keep his options open.

If Black keeps all her stones connected, she's almost certain to win. So I'd be thinking about splitting at the widest gap, which is between the two marked stones. Perhaps at C5.]
;B[hc]LB[fd:A]C[You can consider F6 here, to avoid bad shape.]
;W[hd];B[fd]C[This shape is bad for White (hane at the head of two stones)...]
;W[fe]
(;B[ed]C[...but Black doesn't play to exploit it. Black is strong in the area, so I think she should have played a second hane (see variation).]
;W[de]MA[fg]C[>Natural extension. Now my X stone is very strong.

You normally only jump past your opponent's stones like this if you're happy to sacrifice the stone if Black pushes through.

So what if Black plays the centre point now?]
(;B[eh];W[fh]C[Natural.];B[ef];W[ee]C[Good. This is the only move; if Black plays here he is completely connected. Now Black is cut in two, so she needs to fight to win. See variation]

(;B[ce];W[dd]
(;B[fc]LB[cd:A]C[>I feel this is a mistake by black. In the variation white can not live and so this is why I won the game.

I think you're right, Black should play C6];W[cd]LB[gf:A]C[>My winning move!

;W[gi];B[eg];W[ei];B[di]LB[dh:A]C[Here you have the option to cut at d2 for a ko.]
;W[fi];B[gg]LB[dh:A]C[If you cut at D2 now, you have good chances in the following fight. But you're winning anyway, so I think you're right to keep things simple. See variation.]

White must keep Black cut]
