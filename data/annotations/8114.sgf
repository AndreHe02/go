C[Hi! my name is Naftali, and i was black in this game.
things were going quite well until i suddenly lost a group on the right hand side of the board.
i'd like to know where i went wrong.
Of course i'd be happy to hear any other comments you have about the game.
thank you very much for doing the review!

Hi, Naftali! I have added in comments for the black point of view that I hope are helpful. Also, at certain points, I have added in a few comments about white that may prove useful.]

C[jasper2 [6k\]: thank you
docr [5k\]: thx

Thank you for sending your game to me for reviewing. I hope my comments were helpful (or at least understandable and made sense)! If I was to sum things up in a sentence or two, perhaps I would say that your opening is good, but you need to work on reading some (which is what all teachers say, really!). Make sure to stay aware of when groups are in danger, and pay close attention in the middle game to what sequences are sente and what are gote.

Thank you!])
