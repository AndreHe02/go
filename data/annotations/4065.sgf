C[Daedin: Hello.

Daedin: I am Daedin (aka Kyoshinai), 13k on KGS.];B[pd];W[pp]
;B[dd];W[dp];B[cm]C[Daedin: Though an attack at C7 can be played, it is seldom used, for it does not really threaten the corner or the D4 stone. The usual approach is C6.]
;W[cn];B[em];W[qi];B[oi]C[Daedin: Wrong direction.

Daedin: Here you should either :
 * take advantage of white's tenuki (the fact that he left the fight going to play elsewhere), with a move around F4.
* strengthen your two stones with a move around D11.
* play around K17 in order to build moyo (prospective territory) just the way White did with R11.

However, a move at P11 does not really attack the white stone. It builds influence towards the center, but I think that this is too early at this point.

In the beginning of a game :
 * try and make a moyo (or even territory), in the corners and / or on the sides
 * attack the oponent's corners, thus either making territory or building walls
 * when the big points are more or less settled, invade your oponent's moyo !

But keep in mind that the center is very open in the beginning of the game, and that it is the place where it is most difficult to make territory.]
;W[qh]
(;B[oh]C[Daedin: Too small. A move at Q13 is more consistent.

Daedin: Generally speaking, unless you fear being cut, you do not need to play in contact - in fact that is often too slow, thus bad.]
;W[pg]C[Masauu [30k?\]: After this move, what do I do?  Q14?  R14 doesn't look so good when I check it again

Daedin: in this case, it is not necessary to attack the white stones. They are strong (they can live without any problem), and connected.
Daedin: In that case, the best option is usually to cap the stones. That way, you will make an interesting wall that would give you a strong position in the center.]

(;B[qf];W[qg];B[sg]C[Daedin: This kind of move can be good in a life-and-death situation. Here it is not the case : Black cannot kill, because White can either escape to the center or -more easily - extend to the bottom.]
;W[qj];B[rg]C[Daedin: Small again, for the same reason.];W[rh]
;B[di]C[Daedin: Good.];W[sh];B[rf]C[Daedin: These two stones are not important : at most, they are worth ten points in gote for white. So let him happily capture them, and take an extension around K17, or invade the bottom.]

(;W[qk]C[Daedin: Small. White's few previous moves are small, becaue there is no need for him to play so close. When they are no nearby stones, don't play in contact, but rather play a one jump extension, or moves like that]
;B[jc]C[Daedin: Good.];W[rk]C[Daedin: Unnecessary. Here Black is clearly ahead : White has all his stones in the same place, whereas Black has a well-balanced moyo.]
;B[gp]C[Daedin: Good point. White is enclosed in the corner now.]

(;W[gq]C[Masauu [30k?\]: He spent too much time building up that side, which was a mistake and let me take huge ammounts of territory,  should he have continued our fight for the corner, or begun expanding his own territory instead?

Daedin: In that situation, the best option for white is usually to try and break Black's enclosure (see var. for an exemple).
Daedin: A glance at the goban tells you immediately that Black is far ahead. Therefore, nce White has setlled his corner, he has to invade, for instance with F17-F16 or O16-O17.]

C[Masauu [30k?\]: I let myself get bullied in this corner it seems, but my initial stone positions seemed good?

Daedin: Black has a fairly good result here : White has some points in the corner, but is completely enclosed, and Black has a good wall facing the center. 
Daedin: To me, Black is definitely better here.];B[bo];W[dq]

C[Daedin: As seen in the game, this does not work. Black could instead play at Q5, enclosing White.]

Daedin: Try avoiding contact play when you are not eigher defending or trying to kill. In order to attack a stone, you should not attach to it.]

;W[ml];B[ql]C[Daedin: Here White's group cannot do much in the center (it has nowhere to flee, and Black is so strong there that it will have a very hard time living).

Daedin: White does not have many alternatives. At most he can attack the upper-left corner, and possibly the left side.
Daedin: But anyways he will still be far behind. Black has already won this game.]

(;B[lm]C[Daedin: Too close to the White group. When attacking, try and keep a distance with the group you are attacking. Here a move at K9 (though such a move is probably unnecessary) is better.]

Daedin: Indeed. But be careful : when playing in contact like Black did, it gives White chances to make eyes, like with the double atari.

Masauu [30k?\]: And so I'm kind of in a rush to kill his pieces

Daedin: As long as you prevent him from making two eyes, you will be perfectly fine.]

[qs]C[Masauu [30k?\]: Ok well, I'd appreciate any comments :)
Masauu [30k?\]: This is the cloest game I've managed to have so far, and we both made large mistakes
Masauu [30k?\]: finally, my opening game is still quite weak, I'm mainly just watching high-dan players and seeing their openings and trying to do the same

Daedin: Although you missed some points in the opening, I thought that is was rather good. You avoided playing too close to your own stones (which is often a problem when beginning), and took big points.
Daedin: However, when watching high dan play, one only gets an idea of the shape ; but one does not understand the moves. Therefore one copies them blindly, which can at length be a huge hinder. 
Daedin: I advise you first to play a few (say 50, 100) games on your own, with players about your skill - and have some of them reviewed. Then you'll have a better understanding of global / local situations, and of the basics.
Daedin: Try spotting the mistakes you make the most (for instance contact play), and focus on avoiding them in your next game. When playing a move, ask yourself : what do I gain with this move ? Why do I play it ? It will help you having more focused - thus more efficient - moves.
Daedin: Lastly begin doing some tsumego (life and death problems). There are some interesting things on the internet (www.goproblems.com for instance).


Masauu [30k?\]: Thanks again :)

Daedin: It is always a pleasure to review games from motivated players :)]
