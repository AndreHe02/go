C[game was between two 16k players on KGS

I had black

overall... I'd say my greatest weakness is understanding how local fights effect the board as a whole.

This shows up strongly in fuseki where I usualy end up behind and have to make up ground in the middle game.

What specificly has me confused at the moment is how different corner shapes effect side shape... and knowing this early enough to choose corner aproaches which work out globably as well as localy.

csh: What I have seen from this game is that your opening lacks a sense of direction. It looks like you come out ahead locally in the fights, but then do not take advantage of the resulting board position.]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[pe]C[I tend to be a very territorial player... so i chose to play corner moves that lead to outside influence

It has a balanceing effect on my game ( or so i delude myself into thinking ) so i can play naturaly yet not be overly focused on making territory.

As a side note, I recently had a game with a 1d where he went on to explain that the 4x4 wasn't a territorial move either.  Yet at this time I consided the 4x4 to be a territorial move.

csh: Outside influence can be tricky. The shodan player was right, the 4-4 stone is geared towards influence. I'm hesitant to say that your game is geared towards influence or towards territory. I'll explain more later.

For now, think of the 5-4 stone in the upper right as having influence down the right side of the board and towards the center, while the 4-4 stone has influence towards the center.]
;W[pc]LB[dp:B][ep:A]C[csh: White also has the option of playing in the empty corner. 
In general, opening theory says playing in an empty corner is biggest.

After the open corners are taken, creating a shimari (corner enclosure) is a big move. However, it is a big move to an approach to a 3-4, 5-3, or 5-4 point, too, because these moves prevent a shimari (corner enclosure.)

After that If the open corners are taken, then extensions from shimari are big. Finally, other extensions or approach moves are big.

Here, I would also think about playing in the empty corner. I like how A or B work with the 4-4 stone lower right.]
;B[oc]C[csh: This move can also be in the lower left corner.]
;W[dp]
(;B[mq]LB[jq:A]C[I'm thinking of the lower right as territory.

I'm still waiting on a response to the upper right... but at this time.. I dont see any benifit to pushing at this corner if white feels the need to be playing big moves elsewhere on the board.

csh: First of all, the lower right is not territory. White can still invade the corner (although it is not wise to do so right now.) I added a variation showing an example invasion.

I also think that this extension from the lower right corner is a little small. Extending to A yields a nicer result for Black.

However, opening theory says that an approach to the upper left is bigger than any other move. I also added a variation with an approach to the upper left as well.

Even though White did not respond in the upper right, it's ok to move there and put more pressure on him. You don't have to wait for him to respond. If you end up killing that stone and getting the whole corner, that's even better. Don't depend on your opponent to tell you where the big points are. :)]

(;W[qe];B[pd];W[qd];B[qc];W[rc];B[pb];W[pf];B[of];W[pg]LB[ic:A]
C[csh: After this sequence, Black got a nice result.

Now, an approach to the upper left is big. Note that it would also be nice to have an extension from the upper right group across the top of the board, perhaps somewhere around A.]
;B[dn]C[I have the influence i wanted...  time to chalange white in the corners.

csh: You have the right idea. However, approaching the upper left is bigger.]
;W[fp];B[cp];W[cq];B[co]
(;W[ip]C[csh: This move is a little odd. It leaves weaknesses in the corner that Black may exploit later.]
;B[ck]LB[de:A][bq:B]C[csh: Again, the extension is a little shy.

You can actually approach White's corner, like A for example, but that would lead to a different game. Your lower left corner should be okay because you can either extend along the side or play at B to live in the corner.]
;W[ce]C[csh: White completes the shimari in the upper left. An extension across the top of the board by either side would be a big move.]

(;B[ch]C[i'm not shure is this was the best or not...

I took what seemed to give me solid territory.

This also highlights 2 of my weanesses...
1: using the 4x4 corner - i'm curently working on this one in study
2: using thickness to make territory

csh: This wasn't good. An extension across the top of the board was bigger. I added a variation.

As for your two points:

1) The 4-4 point is used to make frameworks, and then solidifying part of the framework into territory. An extension up the righthand side of the board would do something like that.

2) You *aren't* supposed to use thickness to make territory. The influence you gain from thickness should be used to put pressure on other groups on the board. Thickness allows you to attack weak groups on the board.]
;W[jc]C[csh: White got the key extension first.];B[gc]TR[jc]
C[i'm denying white the top side and hoping my thickness on the right will make his life on the top difficult

csh: I have problems with this invasion. It is awfully hard for this one stone to push pressure on the white stone to the right of it. The problem is that your invading stone is also weak, so you have to take care of it as well.

Your idea of pushing his stone towards your thickness is strategically correct, but you also have to worry about the stones you play. If, for example, your marked black stone at G17 is captured, the white marked stone at K17 is in little danger.]

(;W[fd]C[csh: This move pushes from the wrong side. When you run, you are actually forced by White to attack his stone. If he played from the other side, you'd have been in a lot of trouble.]
;B[hd];W[je];B[hf];W[ff];B[jd]C[while i could run out the bottom... i felt it would be better to make whites center group weaker by cutting it.

I felt confident that i could run with my center group is i realy needed to and had some time to make whites life difficult

csh: Again, I think you have the correct idea strategically. It doesn't look like White can contain you with one move.

However, I don't think that wedging between the white stones is necessarily the strongest play here.]
;W[kd];B[id];W[ne];B[oe]C[i feared the cut at p 15 for white would give white too much influence in the center.. that and i wanted to keep the option open to run if i needed to

csh: White O15 was a forcing move. I think you played this correctly. Being shut out of the center would have been bad.]
;W[fh]C[csh: White should have protected one of the cuts at L15 or L17.]
;B[ke]C[it didn't feel like whites last move would keep me from running.. so I ignored it and atacked on the right

i cut on the top because i felt that white would not be able to make life on the top with k 17 and l 16

csh: Again, good strategy. White's previous move didn't threaten your group that much.]
;W[le];B[kf];W[lf];B[ld];W[kc];B[mc]C[i felt that atacking white on the top would both give all my groups life... letting me avoid running all together

csh: Again, this is strategically correct. In essence, you are "capturing the cutting stones" on a large scale.]
;W[md];B[lc];W[kg];B[jf];W[jg];B[if];W[mg]C[csh: Black should be happy with the result so far. Black has 30 points of territory at the top of the board, and maybe another 15 on the left. White has no definitely territory, but looks like he might make some in the lower left and on the right. White is behind.]
;B[qk]LB[og:A]C[i extended here further than i should have.. but i didnt' want white playing here and making a large group on the right.

csh: This is good strategy. It's hard to know how far to extend. In general, you want to consider the relative strength of the group you are extending from compared to the group you are extending towards.

Since White's group in the upper right is stable, it makes sense to hold back a little bit. (I would actually have suggested extending further along the bottom of the board earlier, since White was not strong in the lower left.)

Note that White can still invade at the 3-3 point in the lower right, so you have to take that into account. This is why the lower right is not your "territory."

I would also consider pushing at A once to threaten his stones in the center. You stand to gain more profit if you are making territory while your opponent is running for his life.]
;W[qn]TR[qk]C[csh: I'm not sure that I agree with White's move. On the one hand, he is playing into a pincer. On the other hand, his group in the upper right is strong, so your marked stone looks like it can be under pressure as well.]

(;B[qo]TR[qk]C[corner is more important that the stone in the center ^_^

csh: I disagree. Your marked stone is important. If you abandon your it, White has the potential for a huge territory.]
;W[pk]C[csh: His move is a little odd.];B[qm]C[trying to connect by attacking a weak stone

I would probably be willing to sacrivise r 9 here.. make solid tirritory and fight elsewhere]
;W[qj]
(;B[pn]C[csh: See the variation.];W[ql];B[pl]C[while i hold no real atatchment to r 9... I dont want to loose it for nothing.. i'm hoping q8 will give me more center influence in sente

as a side note... i would also sacrifice this stone as well to extend to the left with better shape]
;W[rk];B[ol];W[ok];B[nl];W[og]C[csh: This was a big point.]
;B[jq]C[making territory on the side... trying to reduce whites at the same time

csh: This is a good idea.];W[iq];B[jp];W[jo];B[ko];W[mn]C[this move anoyed me...

it tryes to fill up the territory I had ben making and if i try and cut it off directly it's just going to run out.

csh: This type of move is called a reduction. The idea is precisely like what you said. It pushes into your potential territory and then runs back out to allies. However, this reduction is too deep, and you should be able to cut it off. The trick to cutting it off is to not press directly against it, but capture it on a larger scale.]

(;B[io];W[jn];B[kn];W[jm];B[lm]LB[fm:A]C[i'mnot shure if i like whites influence in the center left.. but the sacrifice move at j 5 gave me enough time to enclose n8

csh: Any time that you force your opponent to build strength, you want to make sure that you get more out of the exchange than he did. 

Unfortunately, even though you captured the white stone, and saved maybe six points of territory. White probably benefitted more from this exchange than you did.

Imagine his next move is at A, and you can see that he already might have more than that six points, and is flatening your potential territory at the same time.]

(;B[dq]C[i'm trying to take advantage of whties loose corner... it doesn't work 8(

i saw the ability to atack c3 or to atack d4 here

I felt i would be ahead in the cross cut

csh: Unfortunately, you're right, it doesn't work. White is strong to the right, so your cutting stone will have trouble living. 

You seem to be ahead in territory, so just look to play solidly and poke into White's potential territory.

Sometimes just playing the straightforward move works best. See the variation.]

erfael is wrong, though, it is not a two-stage ko. White will take P1 to make life.]

;B[rs]C[i felt that killing white would be best here as I could think of no great response to m9

this gives him sente though... it may habe ben wise to make a larger move elsewhere and continue the ko fight later

Akamaru [16k\]: but if i hadn't

csh: I think the final outcome was due to the mistakes there. Obviously, the mistakes played the biggest part in this game, so lots of practice will definitely help you improve!

A couple other things that I think would help:

1) Don't play moves to see what will happen. Try to read it out before you play. If you don't see a good outcome, the more straightforward move will probably be better. This will also help you improve.

2) Try and think of your stones and your opponent's stones as being in "groups." Figure out which groups (for both sides) are in the most trouble. If you already have one group in trouble, don't invade somewhere and create another one. Lots of weak groups are hard to keep alive.

In the opening, I think you should concentrate on a few things:

1) Look for extensions that help you build a framework. If you are extending from a strong position, you can extend further. Tiny extensions will hurt you later on, as your positions may not be as efficient as they could have been. This is part of the reason that the bottom right corner ended up so small.

2) Try to think about constructing potential territory instead of just invading or trying to destroy your opponent's. It doesn't matter how much territory your opponent has, as long as you have more.

I hope you found this review useful!

"Influence" is less well defined. You can tell that Black has influence along the right side and bottom of the board, but it's hard to say how many points he will get there.

It's pretty certain, though, that Black will end up with more than the six points White got in the corner. That's why it's bad for White to start the invasion at this time.]

;B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc];B[ck]C[csh: White now has territory in the corner, but Black has created a moyo (framework) on the side. It isn't territory (yet) because there are still ways to invade it.]
)
(;B[jq]C[csh: This variation shows why a bigger extension is better. This is just an example, since approaching the upper left is more urgent.]
;W[qn]C[csh: White would usually approach from the bigger side.]
;B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[qk]C[csh: After this sequence, Black has more potential at the bottom than White does on the right.]
;AB[mq]AE[jq]TR[mq]C[csh: If the K3 stone were at N3 instead, Black's result looks much more cramped.]
