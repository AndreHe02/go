C[How is this move anything but a mistake? White is overconcentrated and does not put any real pressure on black, at least I didn't think it was any real pressure.

EmTom: I think it's not the best move too. I would most certainly play from O3 stone to make it stronger. R8 puts a bit of pressure on black though. It is often a fatal mistake to underestimate moves like that. Black is still ok cause he can go out easily and O3 is weak, but if those change black may be in some trouble.]
(;B[oq]C[I decided to solidify the corner with a contact play

EmTom:
Perhaps it would be better to either pincer white or to play Q2 to make the corner stronger. P3 kicks white so it makes her stronger. This may not be good cause the stronger white gets in the area the weaker the F3 stone becomes. P3 doesn't defend corner completely either.]
;W[np]
(;B[iq]C[I thought that playing here would establish a base and make white over-concentrated when they played L3

EmTom: This is too soft. White wont get the perfect extension but she will be safe. Pincer (last move) would have been better. See variation for the previous move.

You also can consider some more agressive move to try to solidify your position while attacking O3. See variation.]
;W[kq]
(;B[qh]C[This seemed to me to be the biggest point. Expands black and punishes white's slow move at R8. I expected white to run out and allow me to build a moyo while attacking white.

EmTom: You would prefer to have a tone at A to make a decent moyo first so maybe approach at B would be better now. White is almost forced to answer it cause double approach would be too good for black. See variation for other fuseki thoughts.]
;W[qp]C[Was this an overplay? I thought it was and tried to punish.

EmTom: The move is an overplay if you can make it an overplay. Different moves are overplays in pro game than in kyu game...]

;W[op];B[pq]C[EmTom: A mistake. White cannot cut there as that would be self atari. Black should have connected at P5!]
;W[nr]C[I never understood the logic of this move. I felt the two big points were either saving the three stones by connecting or cutting black at P5.

EmTom: I would probably cut at P5. Saving those 3 stones is very small. Only 4 points or so. Cutting is big though.]

It is quite an even game now. You gave white a lot of points in that corner and reduced your own territory. It was a bad fight.]

[ap][gh][ih][qh][rh][sh][gi][hi][ri][si][fj][gj][pj]C[EmTom: Well how to summarize this game... You played well at the beginning. You had some advantage and kept it for a while. Then some bad things happened:
1) You did not use your thickness/influence as well as you could
2) You made at least two major reading mistakes that damaged your position badly
3) (I think) you did not evaluate the position in the key moments and did not think about what you need to do to win. (did you?) :)

Those are the reasons you lost the game at the end. My advice:
1) Try to force your opponent to live small after you seal them in the corner/on the edge instead of trying to kill them and pushing them out to the center (when you have an opportunity to do so). Play some games with that in mind and see what happens. You should have a lot of thickness and your opponent just a few points.

2) Remember to use thickness to attack your opponent and be happy when he jumps into your area of influence. Go back to 1) in those cases and you'll end up with even more influence. If your opponent makes more than one weak group and they are close to each other use splitting attack and see what happens. In that case you will be able to attack more severly and perhaps even kill something.

3) Evaluate position in key moments (at least after every local fight is finished) and have a plan for the game. Think about how to win the game. You don't have to play the most severe moves when you are ahead. You can back away a bit when it is more solid and enough for winning. That is your privilage for getting advantage earlier.

It was a great game to comment and I had a lot of fun doing it. 
Hope you will have as much fun following the review and that you will gain something for yourself from it. 

I would also appreciate if you sent me some feedback regarding this review so that I can also become a better reviewer in the future. Just drop me a message on KGS (EmTom), or OGS (EmTom).

Should you have any further questions regarding this game feel free to contact me as well.]
