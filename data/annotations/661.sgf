;B[qp];W[pj];B[nn]C[Mimer: Even though this move is big. It's to slow in the opening.]

(;W[do]C[Mimer: Oops, you should never push into a knights move unless you intend to cut at c6. Otherwise you will just strengthen your opponent without gaining either territorie or extra liberties.   See variation for a better sequence.]
;B[co];W[en]C[Mimer: Again white is helping black.];B[dm];W[hn]
;B[jp];W[ch];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[de]C[Mimer: This move only removes white's liberties. Connecting at D17 is a lot better.]
;B[dc]C[Mimer: A natural move. Black could also play simple by connecting at C14 aiming at attacking the white C12 stone.]
;W[ec];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fe]C[probably i didn't handle the upper left corner very well,

but i was more or less satisfied with my position at this moment



On the other hand:

1) i'm quite sure that i didn't do well on the top

2) what should i have done to reduce the black bottom? and when?



Mimer: For the two questions se my earlier comments.   A note about the top left corner:

Both players have bad aji. White has the E16 cut to worry about while black should keep in mind that D18 is almost sente or that white could play B17 followed by the cut at C14.]
;B[nc];W[lc];B[pb]C[Mimer: this is a mistake by black white can now play O16 confinig black to the corner. See variation.]

(;W[qc];B[ne];W[pf];B[jc]C[Mimer: this seems like an overplay. L16 would be the normal move.]
;W[kd]C[Mimer: Good.];B[qb]C[Mimer: Black has to answer at K16 or J15.]
;W[kf]C[Mimer: Now black has a problem.];B[kc];W[ld];B[lb];W[mb]
;B[ka];W[mc];B[fb];W[fc];B[gb]C[Mimer: Now the game is full of opportunities for white. D19, J18 and S18 are all good moves. I would probaly play D18 keeping black seperated. See variation.]

(;W[rb];B[pc];W[qd];B[od]
(;W[nb]C[Mimer: Wrong direction. White should play from the outside with O13. See variation.]
;B[ng];W[oh];B[mh];W[ck];B[cg];W[bh]C[Mimer: When your opponent play a contact move like C13 you almost always play D12. especially in this case since white has a good follow up at E14.]
;B[bm];W[kh];B[mj];W[nk];B[lk]C[Mimer: black dosn't have to answer. Playing H16 is vital since it stregthens black at split white's two groups]

Mimer: Yes, Locally H17 is better];B[hc];W[ib];B[jb];W[ma];B[ia]
;W[ob];B[oc];W[jh];B[mm]C[Mimer: the game is now over. Black is safe every where, leading in territorie and white has two weak groups.]

but now, after the game. this doesn't seem clear anymore.

On the other hand, maybe I lost the game even before.];B[hm]

but I think now the game is clearly lost, isn't it?

Could i still have done anything to reduce the black territory

in the lower right?



Mimer: It is to late to reduce black's territory.];B[ej];W[fk]
