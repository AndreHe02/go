C[A pretty close game from a KGS tournament.  I played white; apart from my losing those 8 stones at the end, I can see no really big mistakes, neither on my part nor my opponent's.

Hi, this is gryn, I'm happy to help you with a review today.  Let's look at the game.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[qf];W[kp];B[jd];W[cf];B[cd];W[ef]
TR[ci][cj][dj]C[E14 should *definitely* be flat, your choice how you do it.
Black should immediately pinch (or at least some play on the left.)]
;B[pn];W[pk]LB[qn:A]C[Traditionally, I might have answered at A.  Now I learned the proverb about not attaching to a lone stone and am trying to act by it :-).

Well, these stones are actually in hard locations to give judgments on, to me at least.  One thing I can comment is that the 3-4 stone entices your opponent to play on it's other side (i.e. not the side black played on).  That he played on the "wrong side" indicates he thinks the right side of the board is more important than the bottom.  If you agree, then the pinch is a good idea.  If you don't agree, then you can make the shimari that he failed to take.]
;B[op];W[pq];B[oq];W[nk]C[Playing up here indicates you will attack black, because now black is enticed to play R11.]
;B[dh]C[A good move by black.];W[cl];B[dk]LB[dk:B][cl:A]C[This move strikes me as important.  During the game I thought I would be able to connect the two upper stones to A.  I'm not sure I realized during the game, but in retrospect they definitely look cut now.

Also, after B, A doesn't seem like a very good move (if it ever did).  Can you suggest a better alternative?

B is not a bad move.

I think the only complaint with A, which is in the right direction, is that it does not work well with D4.  because of that, I would consider moving whites' stone closer to the black stones, so that way you leave a better relationship with D4.

The move A by itself certainly does not connect -- no move really can, because black can always play C12 or C13 or B12, etc, if he wishes to disconnect you.  I think this highlights the importance of not playing E14 first, as I mentioned earlier.  Black has played C16 so it makes it more difficult for white to find a base once pinched.

On the otherhand, if A was played closer, you could apply better pressure to the black stones.  Then attempt to make a base by running to the center or the top -- black still has weaknesses around F17-H17, and the center is open.

So, I may not be able to judge definitely, E14 may be a style diasgreement -- but to me it makes sense that E14 would not be played over C11, etc. earlier.]
;W[gd]C[An elephant jump.

I would play G14 or F16 instead.];B[fc];W[fd];B[ed];W[fe]C[This should be at E15 for better shape.]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[md];W[ic]C[This is not the time for this move.  This white group is "floating".  He will have difficulty getting an eye on the right (because of black's sente moves, such as D13 or C13).  Also, it will be hard to force an eye on the top (as you can see after J17, K17 -- there is no eye potential).

*So*, since black already has N16, it means there is difficulty using a move like J17 as an attack to get an eye, and white needs eyes.

The center.  That's where you will need to get them.  You can press the floating black group, or just run out  I'd recommend E11 or F12.

Instead this move removes possibilities you could use later.  (aji keshi).  It's only worth points.  Additionally black playing here is gote, so it's your perogative to play here first, not his.  So there is no rush.]
;B[jc];W[id];B[kg]LB[id:A][kg:B]C[I was satisfied with the result of the sequence up to A, thinking I had gotten a nice wall out of it.  In retrospect, B seems to take away much of its influence.

On the whole, whites position looks a bit insecure to me, while black's looks much more solid.  I managed to make the game close though, so maybe it's just my judgement that's wrong (I don't have much faith in general in my own positional judgement).  How would you judge this position?

I'd say it depends on what happens to the floating groups, as well as the bottom left.  However, I would much prefer black right now -- white's presses (as well as E14) have afforded him some solid points on the top (25-30?).

As for A vs B, A is almost dame, a pass.  B has use, but I think it is not an urgent move.  So, if playing, I would play both differently.

After A, I would play F13 or some sort of press on white from my floating group on the left.  Instead of A, I would do the same to black (F12 etc.).

The "wall" you mention can only be used to pressure black's group.  So B doesn't really counter act it even.  That's why the F12 area is pivotal (literaly) for both players.]
;W[ig]C[Here I tried to make use of my wall to get out and maybe connect to my stones on the lower side.

At least you are getting out, however, pressuring the black group may be better here since black has no reason to respond directly, and if he does (say L11), then this just adds pressure to the O9 floating group.

This is the two brothers principle.  (Two brothers don't setup shop next to each other, because each of there shops will only hurt each other -- so don't play moves for one group at the expense of another).]
;B[eg];W[df]LB[df:A][dh:B]C[I was a little afraid of black cutting at A from the time she played B; now I thoght A had definitely become urgent.]
;B[gg]C[Black jumps into an attack, very good for him.  By playing E14, though, he has opened up eye potential on the left.]
;W[ji]C[!

White is running with keima.  This is like running with scissors.]
;B[ki]C[Black should probably just cut.  Pressing here can only hurt his left side group.]
;W[jj];B[kj];W[kk];B[mn]C[(note is on next white move for what variations are for).]

(;W[kn]C[I wanted to stop white from escaping to the middle.  This I did accomplish, but in return, black's group lived on its own.  It seems like it should still be possible to kill it, or at least to make it small, but it's still to undecided for me to read.  Could you show some variations?

Assuming you do not play L6 (let black run out while trying to kill -- a gamble), what other moves could white consider?

The two that spring to mind are N3, and R8.  Both help tak away eyeshape and bases.

However, if you realize that there are 2 such moves, when you make a play for one, black can make a play for the other.  So, at best, you can take away the easier of the two.

Let's just look at them and show that Black has plenty of oppontunities to live.]
;B[fo]C[White *is* open here, but still this is an odd position for an invasion.
Black's group is still floating on the left, as well as the one on the right.

Even though we have said that they can live -- those conditions are based on their surroundings.  Invading like this now, is likely to affect one or the other group.  So, I would say this is at least ill timed.  If black insists on invading right now, playing C3/C4 or D3 is safer since it is less likely to kill one of the other two groups.

Instead settling one of the groups (at least) before invading would be prudent.  Black has already given up (mostly) his attack on the floating white groups.]
;W[fq]C[I would play D6 instead, but this is fine too.];B[em]
;W[hj];B[fj]LB[hj:C][cl:B][cn:A]C[Black A seems better to me, effectively cutting cutting stone at B.  I played at A a few moves later.

On the other hand, my move at C seems rather small now.  What is your opinion on these moves?

C is a necessary response since you both have given up your attacks, C is needed to protect your cut.]
;W[ho];B[gp];W[hq]C[probably too tight, might be better to play C6 now.]
;B[gq];W[gr];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[cn]C[After these presses, C4 would make better shape.]
;B[hp];W[ip]C[ouch! I don't think white can play like this.]
;B[do];W[cp];B[iq];W[hr];B[io];W[jp]C[black gives white a present with these forcing moves.  Playing H2 instead of J3, at the least would have broken through to the bottom for black.  Instead J3 let white fix his problems.]
;B[hn];W[in];B[jo];W[jn];B[go];W[ko];B[ho]C[H5 is a big mistake.  H5 for either player is worth 1 point. (by black he makes no points, by white he takes 2 stones, but black takes back, so he loses one too, a net gain of 1 point by white -- zero points if black moves, +1 for white if white moves).  Black has lost the iniative whene there are *alot* of big moves left.  

Additionally, all of these presses means that P4 now will have a rougher time living.  Instead of h5, black should probably have played pressing moves there to live on the right.

White should take advantag of that and attack!];W[mq]C[This seems too mild now.

Very good!  I probably would have played from the other side, but otherwise attacking is correct.  I don't understand how it is too mild now.  You suggest that the attack has less weight than it does before.  However, you have the L4-L6 wall to help you in your attack now, which you did not have before.  How could it be *less* now compared with the past?]
;B[pr]C[This forcing move seems natural.  (as you saw in my example variations earlier).]
;W[qr];B[pp];W[qq];B[nr]C[O2 is probably hasty.  As you saw before, knowing that L+1 is nearly dead, black can force white to take the P2 stone in order to live, letting him make moves on the right for free.  the O2 move is hard to turn into an eye.  Black still needs O3, and white usually can play Q1  for free, which ruins the eye in any case (generally a move like O2 only makes an eye in KO, or if O2 threatens to connect some where).]
;W[qn]C[Excellent, you could take the Q1 atari first, if you'd like, though black can start a KO.]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[ol];W[ok];B[nl];W[ml]TR[ib][be][qh][ck]C[this move is just helping black's shape.  What is black's obvious response?  N7.  What does that  do?  Take away one of your liberties.  So, white ends up with a weak stone.  What does black get?  More well defined eyeshape (at least an eye at O7.  I would consider leaving black alone, unless you can kill him.

Killing him probably is difficult, though...

instead, you could consider playing the remaining big moves.  B15, J18,  C9, trying an invasion on the right, or just reducing at R12.]
;B[mm];W[lk];B[ph]C[If I were black I would play R11 instead.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[qm];B[oo]C[At this point white should consider killing black.  the O6 area has a vital point to reduce it to one eye.  The P2 "eye" could be removed.  Most likely, white will have to fight a KO to kill.  Black could choose to live, but White can at least get a small profit.  It seems that white must start with Q1, black can live with O6, but white gets to take the Q2 stone in sente.  This is worth alot of points, and they are all free for white.

Even if you don't see all the variations, you should be able to smell the aji.  (And I admit I could be wrong with my varations I have worked out in my head).]
;W[li]C[It would be better, probably to play L12 over M11.  asking black to play L12 instead, is fixing his shape.]
;B[lh];W[lj];B[kh];W[nh]C[If you wanted to reduce with O12 play it directly.  You already know white has to follow the M11 sequence -- no need to play it out first.  (then perhaps you can play it differently, and get L12 instead).]

I saw the potential danger of A at this point, but figured I could always play A when the group ran out of outside liberties.  Well, I forgot.]
;W[qi]C[Can you see a better way of gaining some territory here?

Q1 is still there.  If you count and you are behind, you have to go deeper and inaved.  If you count and you are ahead then, Q1, R11, A17 and M16 are all good.]

I didn't find so many ko threats, while black had plenty.

Well, regardless, you have to make him pay in ko threats.  It's rarely a good idea to give up a ko like this.  A is generally a good move (I'd say, so long as you have at least 1 ko threat).]

(;W[ec]C[For a moment I thought that with some luck, I might even be able to kill the black group.  Do you see a way to do that?

No, when a group has 2 outside liberties, it can be very difficult to get a kill, since they will always be able to press your stones to capture.]
