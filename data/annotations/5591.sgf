;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[qo];B[oo]C[Is this the correct move? I'm trying to create territory on the LHS

No, it isn't.  It may be important to look at the high chinese opening.  This isn't it, but it's close.  The idea is to make some low territory on the right, rather than influence pointing to the left.  The main problem with this approach is that you don't have a stone at K4 (or similar), so white can simply play there next canceling out your influence.

Of course, they have a more immediate concern of trying to live under your opressive stonage.]
;W[qq];B[pp];W[qp]C[alive!];B[jp]TR[oo][pp][pq]C[There you go.  However, if it were me playing white, I probably would have played there so you couldn't.  Also note that your extension is less than ideal... The triangle stones don't make up a very good shape and the area between the square and the triangles is only around 20 points (4x5).]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[jd]TR[qd][pk]C[Now this is what the chinese opening is all about.  See how your K16 stone works with your Q9 and R16 stones to make a huge-looking area?  White has almost no choice but to try and live in there some how.  And their running game could be your opportunity to make some decent territory!]

;W[qc];B[pd];W[pc];B[fq];W[lp]C[What's the best move here for black?

This situation is already a little grim for black.  Part of the problem is p2.  A natural followup would have put a stone at O3 some time ago so that white can't cut there.  I think playing on top like you did is ok, but realize that touching an enemy stone starts a fight.  You can use a touching move for defense (e.g. living in a tight space), but it might help white here.  

I looked at L5 and I think I like the results better but white has a lot of room to do things in here.]

TR[cj][dj]C[What's the best move now for black?

That is a somewhat subjective question.  Things look a little strange for black.  The biggest move available is probably around C10 or D10 to use the two stones on line-6 for something.  I also might try e16.  I don't think it's a very good move exactly, but white is likely to answer it letting black build thickness on top (variation).]

;B[ej];W[pi]TR[pd][qd][oe]SQ[pk][pl][pm][qn][rn]C[How do I defend against this move?

The best defense is to have played a defensive move before now.  White has uses a separating attack to create two weak groups out of two groups that looked to be working together.  Again, there's no sure way to connect the triangle and square groups now.  Had you played something around Q12 or Q11 previously, white wouldn't have been able to do this.]

(;B[oi]C[The touching "attacks" usually don't help in situations like this though.  They just start a fight, which is probably what white wants during an invasion.]
