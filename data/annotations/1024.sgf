C[DRS: My teacher would say that A, B, C or D is bigger than E.]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[bc];B[bb];W[co];B[cj]LB[oq:A][op:B][cj:C][jp:D]
C[DRS: Same thing here: my teacher would say that A or B is bigger than C.

Also, I think that the top side is a wider area than the left side, as is the bottom - so a move there will probably be bigger (but most likely not as big as A or B).

The three black stones are fine, I don't think you need to extend to help them, if that was your intention.  The two white cutting stones are doomed.

Also, as far as a 3-4 + 5-3 shimari like we have in the lower right, I believe a move around D or so is bigger than a move around C (disregarding C14, which makes C even smaller)]
;W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[oq];B[nc]LB[jc:A][iq:B]
C[DRS: This is ok, you're playing a shimari with your 4-4.  I think it would probably be larger to play around A or B though.  Shimaris with 4-4's are lower priority than with 3-4's, because 4-4's require 3 moves to really hold onto the corner.  A is good because it nullifies white's wall in the top left, and B is good because it reduces the potential of white's shimari in the lower left.  Note that both A and B leave room for a 2 point extension as a followup on either side, so you have room for a nice extension no matter which side white might approach from.

In the case of B, we played closer to the left corner than the right corner, because the left corner is more developable toward the middle bottom than the right corner.]
;W[qg];B[qn]LB[ql:A]C[DRS: I think this invites an invasion.  Sometimes this would be good fast development, but this invasion allows white to divide black into two weak groups - which makes A a good move for white.]

;W[qi];B[ri];W[rh];B[sj];W[rd];B[qe]C[DRS: I don't think this push is very helpful, unless perhaps you are using it to build influence.  It will probably only strengthen the connection between white's stones.]
;W[re];B[pf];W[qd];B[pc];W[qf];B[pg];W[oi];B[ph];W[qh];B[ni]
;W[oh]C[DRS: I'm not convinced there's any way of shutting White in.  See variation.]

(;B[nh];W[og];B[of];W[ng];B[jc]C[DRS: This is big.  You're extending from your wall, and reducing the value of an extension by white from white's wall.  Consider what would happen if White played this point instead of Black: Black's group would be under attack, at the same time White is developing from the nice White wall on the left.]
;W[hc]C[DRS: Painfully small development.];B[jd]LB[je:A]C[You could probably have played A - faster development.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[me];B[md]C[DRS: This is probably obvious to you now.]

;W[lq];B[cm]LB[eo:A][dr:B]C[DRS: This is kind of a small extension for this stage of the game, I think.  It might be preferrable to try reducing White's large moyo in the bottom left with a move like A or B.]
;W[hq];B[jf];W[he];B[ih];W[li];B[mk];W[lk];B[ll];W[mj];B[nj]
;W[lj];B[km]LB[kn:A][jn:B][bn:C][ib:D][rb:E]C[DRS: if the goal here was to move out and keep White from developing the bottom further, A or B might be better.

If the goal was just to make a point, there are numerous larger spots on the board, like C, D and E.]

;W[hb];B[ib];W[ga];B[ia];W[ic];B[gb]C[DRS: I think this is a mistake.  See variation.]

(;W[fa];B[kb];W[da];B[ca]LB[ab:A]C[DRS: White A makes a ko for White.  It's not necessarily a good ko for either side, but it's worth being aware of.]
;W[ea];B[ac];W[rb];B[qb];W[qc];B[qa]LB[ra:A]C[DRS: In general, this isn't so good, because it leaves a useful forcing move for White at A.

In this case, it's worse than that, as you likely already know, because of Q17's shortage of liberties.]

;W[ds];B[bs]C[nikopol: Was this move really necessary?

DRS: I don't think it's strictly necessary, but it does prevent you from having to give up two stones and having to capture the two white stones.  It's not small for this stage of the game.]
