I had a hard time responding to this maybe just o17 or o16 is fine?

I really got crushed this game.];B[nc]C[Janr: after such double approach move, white usually can choose what direction to take.
Often, black will get the 3-3 point and the corner.
In understand here black's taste likes more the right side, but due to white's pincer this will be a bit cramped.
If black rellay wants to right side, it may be simpler to just play r9 or r8 or such rather than an approach move( at r14).]
;W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[qd]C[janr: I prefer the 3-3 point];W[qc]
C[Did I miss something here? Should I have played back? arg the questions.]

(;B[qe];W[pc]C[White's q10 is maybe not optimal but still quite annoying]
;B[qh]C[This seemed slack by me I wasn't happy with the results]
;W[ld]C[Other side maybe?


jan: a bit of aji remains in the cut of O15.  It seems normal for white to play on the upper side to cover this problem indirectly.]

(;B[qn];W[og];B[oh];W[nh];B[oi]C[The value of q10 has greatly decreased.
I dont think it was very urgent for white to play here];W[cn]
;B[fq];W[dj];B[ed]C[Here a clear mistake should be f17 I think.

jan: yes, f17 is the normal / better move here.];W[gc];B[cc]

;B[iq];W[nq]
(;B[qp]C[a bit defensive.
Black is probably behind, so something more aggressive is desirable.]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[ko]C[The b4/c3 exchange is usually not good for white when not followed up, e;g. at e6
Now, black's invasion at c8 (or attachment at c7) is more severe.]

(;B[dl]C[Maybe this was to premature should kill q10 maybe?

janr: black defended at r4 when he had the chance to capture q10 on a larger scale.  Now white is strong at the bottom and moves enlarging the right will be less effective.

locally, I prefer c8 over the game move d8: white can just connect on the left side and white's group on the bottom is now stable and hard to attack if black gets some influence on the left side.]
;W[en]C[janr: even though white can just defend the left, he chooses for an attack.
The attack is difficult because white must give up the option to connect his unstable f6 group with the main left side, and because black's d8 stone is high and can run easily to other black stones.]
;B[fl];W[gn];B[fi]C[now white has a weak group while black feels reasonably light to me.]

(;W[pm];B[qm];W[pl];B[jj]C[janr: i don't understand this move.  Black already have a lot of stones here.]

C[white's move doesnt reply to black's sente, so black should consider to continue the attack.  White doesn't threaten a lot.]
