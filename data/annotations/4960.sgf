C[Balladeer: Hi Rami

At least i like it that you added some questions and variations, then I can answer them and help you along with things you don't know. Off course if other things are being played that are wrong in some way (that i can see) I will say so.

A lot of people ask how to become stronger, and i consequently answer with pretty much the same: have fun in playing and play a lot! Also getting some comments on your games every once in a while helps a lot. Enjoy the review :)

I added your and my name with the comments, else the rest of the readers of this review won't understand. If there is no name, it is my comment.

Rami: Hi reviewer. Here is a game I played on a real goban yesterday. I'm black, and white is french 2k. (I'm about 4k)
You'll see I don't remember all the moves. So don't pay too much attention on fights. Instead, I'd like to know your feelings about the choice of josekis.

I often comment games on the ladder, and usually, most questions made by the reviewee are out of context. I added questions along the game to show you how I think, but I'm quite sure they are irrelevant. So do as you like !

Last : what do you think I need to become 3 dan ? Keep dreaming ?

Thanks !];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ec];B[fq];W[dn]C[Rabi: I'm experimenting Kobayashi]

(;B[dr]C[I usually don't play here. In variation is my plan.]

(;W[hq]LB[gp:A][cq:B][gq:C]C[This move is spoiling blacks plan, but you have to think about the direction after the joseki here, see variation]

(;B[gp]C[Rami: This does not seem to be joseki (usually G3 or C3 are more reasonnable)

Balladeer: G3 i have never seen before and looks like a bad move to me actually; see variation]

(;W[cq]C[So this is not good, too easy for black];B[hp]LB[qn:B]
[po:A]C[Rami: I like this result. I could also have played around K3. I don't think it's a good idea since my F3 group is weak

Balladeer: You definitly need a move here indeed. I still dont think it is that good for you, but something funny has happened: after the F3, D6, D2, C3, H4 joseki, white played H3 and black answered G4. H3 is a very strange move in this situation, but black also made a very strange answer, playing at G4. So it might well be even, with both players playing 1 funny move.

 see variation]
(;W[po]LB[pl:B][oo:A]C[I'd prefer to keep a little more distance since black is quite strong in the lower left]

(;B[oo]LB[on:B][op:A]C[Rami: I play this move because I want to develop the bottom. I'd like to know your opinion on this move.

Balladeer: Possible, the question is after you built your wall, can white move out with his H3 stone? In the variations I show that it is very hard to kill the H3 stone, so I don't think this is right.]

(;W[op]C[Rami: White doesn't like josekis. I like his style. However, it seems bad here.

Balladeer: This looks a bit like an overplay to me, white will be cut and will have a tough time looking after his stones.]
;B[pp]LB[np:A][oq:B]
(;W[np]LB[pn:A][no:B]C[This is quite easy to punish, and i think it is a mistake, see variation]

(;W[or]LB[pi:A][kq:B]C[Rami: Not too bad for black. Good corner, sente, and development on the right side, although I have 2 weaknesses at O5 and P3.
What do you think of P2 ? Isn't it better to take sente, or play P3 with bad shape however ?

Balladeer: This is clearly good for black, you don't have weaknesses, those are just moves white can use to reinforce himself a little, but that doesn't matter. You get the corner and a lot of influence to the left side, black can be happy.
White should not play P2, but P3 and take sente, P2 is too slow. It may be bad shape, but black can't do much with that... See variation]

(;B[pi]C[Feels a bit too close to your strength, I would not play at the left side at all, because if white moves in, he is uncomfortable anyways, see variation]
;W[mc]LB[oc:B][cd:A]C[Rami: I dunno what to do, so I tenuki

Balladeer: Strange move from white, if black plays P17 he gets a big corner and it is unclear what the N17 stone is doing. O17 would be better here, but K3 is still a huge point for both, strengthening yourself and weakening the other.]

(;B[cd]LB[cc:A][de:B][dg:C]
(;W[cc]C[Rami: Strange.... What do U think of the sequence ?

Balladeer: Many strange moves here from both, this seems wrong direction for white, but why not just B17 for black now?]

(;B[dc]C[Rami: Here I feel there is something here. But there is nothing !!!!!!!

;B[jd];W[oe]C[Rami: Mmmmh... Thank you white for these last 3 moves ?

Balladeer: Yes, black feels a little happier because of this]

(;B[od]C[Rami: I simply know I played here at some moment, and I was pretty confident this would kill the corner. Of course, it's bad shape, and I thought about S16 instead, but I would have felt overconcentrated. Clearly this was bad. I'd be glad you show me possible sequences here, because I can't believe white can play like this, spreading weak groups everywhere.

Balladeer: True, this shouldn't end up right for white, but you allready had a chance to be much harder on him. 
This move seems not too bad, it puts pressure on him on the outside, see variations.

I think this or O18 is good, it doesnt matter much if white lives in the corner, or gets a ko there, as long as you get a good attack on the outside. Also, if he moves the stones on the outside out, you should be able to kill the corner cleanly.]
;W[re]C[Big overplay]
(;B[rf];W[qe]C[Rami: Ok, I'm cut. That's reaaaaaaaaally bad. So I choose the calm way.

Balladeer: Yes, letting your opponent cut you here is not good.]

(;B[of]C[Rami: So I'll try to take the other group, or at least attack it.

Balladeer: You sacrifice a lot of the right side here, see variation, also you give away the corner like this, that isnt alive as it lies]

Balladeer: You are behind now however, so a calm move is nice, but this is not the time for it, better to play R19 and keep attacking white.]
;W[ob];B[cl]C[Rami: Ok. Time for a suicide move.

Balladeer: Ok a lot of fighting follows, I answered a few questions there, but the main points lies in the opening. K3 is still a huge move for white here by the way, neither of you has seen that it seems.
I hope you enjoyed and learnt from it, good luck further :)]
