Hello Timo Jalonen, my name is Jay (KGS: Flight) and I'll be reviewing your game. I'm going to start by saying that there is no such thing as a peaceful game. Sure there are games when there are no close life and death situations, but the game of Go is ultimately a fight over territory. In fact, large-scale bouts for territory require much more strategy and it even requires reading.]

It's fine];B[dg];W[fe]C[18: didn't really know how to respond

(;B[db];W[cd]C[This move is no longer necessary to live, G16 is still open and your left side is very very weak.]
;B[bc];W[bd]C[Same comment as before];B[cc];W[dh]C[38: Too greedy?

Not just greedy - it doesn't work, period.];B[di];W[eh];B[fi]
;W[ci];B[ei];W[bi];B[ah];W[ai];B[fh];W[ag];B[dh]
(;W[be]C[50: is this necessary?

No, you're way too defensive, and your left side is still fairly weak. The bottom is very nice, and G16 is no longer the biggest point N17 would probably be more profitable now.]
;B[iq]C[Black should attack top, which you neglected to completely defend]
;W[kq];B[rg];W[rf];B[rh];W[bo]C[Forcing black to strengthen himself is never a good move.]
;B[bp]C[Thank you, white];W[ko];B[io];W[nf];B[ld];W[nh];B[pb]
;W[qb];B[ob];W[rc];B[ao];W[an];B[ap];W[cn]C[70: what is best here?

This is ok];B[im];W[km]TR[rg][ph][qh][rh][qk]C[Right side is starting to look attackable]
;B[pl];W[pm];B[nl];W[om];B[ol];W[mm]TR[gb][hb][ib][gc][hc][ic]
[gd][hd][id]C[Black is clearly weak here, you can try to kill him instead of merely defending, and the top is STILL open.]
;B[ml];W[lm];B[rl];W[rm]C[You shouldn't follow every one of your opponent's endgame moves, treating them like sente. Sente moves are only sente if you respond to them.]
;B[gf]C[This move greatly lessens G16's urgency];W[lf];B[jd]
C[G16 is almost worthless now];W[jf];B[gd]C[Finally...];W[pj]
C[Clearly too far]
(;B[qj];W[pi]C[90: didn't really think this through];B[oi];W[nj]
(;B[oj];W[ni];B[jk];W[kk]C[96: L10 better? or something else

This move is worthless. It is pretty much late endgame and the biggest moves are K2 (incredibly large, especially since it's double sente), T14 for black, H6 then E6  for white (otherwise, black should C5 followed by a D6, and T7 for black (reverse sente for you).]
;B[kj];W[li];B[ji];W[fm];B[gp]C[Note that this move is ineffective and tiny.

This is the last comment of the game, since endgame is pretty much a matter of counting and consequently the only way to improve your endgame is to learn how to count effectively. Endgame is a portion of the game where style no longer comes into play and there is only one correct path, and each incorrect path is less point-effective (though since your opponent makes the same blunders, it pretty much evens out)]
