C[This is my second game I am having reviewed and I have not recieved the first one back yet so if you give me any tips on how to comment this well for you it would be greatly appreciated.

Exswoo[10k\]:Hi.  I'll try to point out the major mistakes you made.  I'll put a [exs\] before each comment I make, just so that everything's clear and legible :)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[cp];B[qj];W[qe]LB[pe:A]C[[exs\]:White's move is playable, but I think A would be safer, since it doesn't go in as deep into black.]
;B[qd]LB[qg:A]C[I now know that this is a poor move - could you explain why?

[exs\]:Well, the whole point of a contact move like this is to force white into a concentrated shape to offset your own bad shape.

It's not the type of move that I like to play, but it's not a bad move per se, although I would instead extend at A to put pressure on white while increasing your territory.]
;W[jd]C[[exs\]-Hmm, white's decided to ignore his stone at Q-15]
;B[nd]LB[pe:A]C[[exs\]-That may be playable, but I personally would just play at A to avoid complications down the road.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[jp];B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[lp];B[kq];W[jq];B[jr]
LB[kp:A]C[[exs\]:Your sequence up to here is okay, but now you're trying to do the wrong thing here.    Since you don't have enough space down there to make two eyes(unless you get very, very lucky.  You want to instead break out into the middle, with A.]
;W[ir];B[kr];W[kp]
(;B[dj]TR[kq][lq][jr][kr]SQ[mq][nq]C[Don't give up on the stones just yet!  Since both groups have 3 liberties, you should be able to win if you move first.  Check the variation.]
;W[cj];B[dg];W[cg];B[dm];W[cm]C[The last 6 moves were awkward - I'm not sure if they were good for me or him - or neither

[exs\]They're bad for both sides, but it's much worse for white since he's the one that has territory at stake.  You should be able to invade inside his territory quite easily.  Check the var. for an example.]

(;B[ee];W[oq];B[op];W[pq];B[qq]C[I shouldn't have let him get that line of whites, but he wasted one precious turn and I managed to make it work]

;W[lf];B[le];W[ke];B[pe];W[pf];B[lb];W[kb]LB[ed:B][ci:C][nk:A]
[cl:D][cn:E][fp:F]C[[exs\]:  There are all very small moves that you're playing here.  There are much bigger moves on the board, so you should concentrat there first.

For example, you have a huge wall on the bottom that you can easily extend with a move like A.

Or you can invade White on the left with either B-F];B[ka];W[ja]

C[[exs\] You're letting White off too easy, but you have huge wall now.]
;B[pm]C[[exs\] That's way too close to your wall.  You should feel free to extend far when you have a large wall as yours.]

;W[kj];B[jh]LB[hk:A]C[His jumps in the middle are hurting - how can I stop them or at least do something so it's good for me too?

[exs\]  What do you mean?  White's not invading into your territory and you have a huge lead as it is...Just try to secure the left territory with something like A.]

[exs\] Well, You already have one eye, so you just need one more...which is almost guaranteed given the large space you have to work with.

If you want to salvage as much territory as you can, just play around A or B.]

(;B[rf]C[Here I've gone over and saw that white could still make life and it would have been better to move to double atari with R14 instead - could you please clarify this for me?

[exs\] Ah, so you did see this sequence.  You're right in that White could live if he plays properly though.]

[exs\]  I think you did really well in this game.  Of course, your opponent didn't seem to read into his moves as much as he should've, or both the groups you killed would've lived.

One of the biggest mistakes you're making is to be so caught up in trying to capture  a single stone that is often resulting in a bad shape when you can't capture it...which is what happened to the big group on the left.  Still, I think you played very well for your level and I'm sure that you'll be moving up to the teens very soon :)]
