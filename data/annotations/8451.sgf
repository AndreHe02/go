C[Hi, I'll be reviewing this game between "Tequs" 9-kyu and "hongheinha" 10-kyu. I'm around 2-dan based on Japanese rankings. Before I start, just keep in mind that I'm by no means a perfect player and you should take what I say with a grain of salt. However, I will do my best to point out where you could've done better, with an emphasis on the first 50 moves as you requested. In addition, even though the review is for black, I will comment on white's moves as well to give more balance and some insight as to your opponent's line of thought.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[fc]C[The first questionable move. I can see what you're thinking, but in this situation the move is soft. It's better to play more confidently and approach the unbalanced corner.]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr]C[The choice of joseki from white is questionable. The classic shape is at K4.]
;B[qq];W[jq]C[Now white is too low. It would be slightly better to play at M4 here instead, but white's shape is weak regardless. However, the opening is still very comfortable for white.]
;B[ck];W[cn];B[ch];W[fd]C[C18 is a more solid response. White is trying to play more actively, but it is not necessary in this opening.]
;B[gc];W[gd];B[pj]C[I would prefer to play closer to the corner here at Q14. Your group is safe because R6 is low, so it is vital to protect your corner.]
;W[qc]C[The invasion is natural.];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc]
;W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]C[The result is bad for black. The wall is not working and the top becomes small because of the open skirt at O18.]
;W[mg]C[The invasion is too deep. The proper reduction is at N10, now black has a chance to attack and make some territory.]
;B[cq]C[This move is aji-keshi. The best plan here is to attack the N13 stone at N10 with the aim to press down on the bottom after, taking advantage of white's low position and making territory in the center.]
;W[cp];B[dp];W[eq]
(;B[ep]C[Better to push at D5 here.];W[fp];B[fq];W[eo];B[gp]
;W[fo];B[ip];W[jp];B[hn]C[The result is terrible for black. There is a weak group, white's corner is large, and it is no longer possible to attack the N13 stone.]
;W[le];B[no]C[You need to be careful about your left group. After the corner sequence, it is now in danger.]
;W[mp];B[kd];W[ld];B[lc];W[ke];B[jd];W[jg];B[if];W[nl];B[pl]
C[This move is too passive. It is better to attack on the other side to reinforce your two weak groups.]
;W[ek]C[White hits the vital point.];B[eh];W[di];B[ci];W[dh]
;B[cg];W[dg];B[bf];W[ce];B[hh]C[This is almost a "pass" move. The endgame has already started. I understand you're trying to save the D12 stone, but that stone is very small. You can still reduce the center through J14 and H6, so you need to settle your last weak group at H6. The big moves you need to be looking at are B7, R2, and C18 in no particular order.]
;W[be]C[White takes a pretty big point.];B[dn]C[You're playing from the wrong side. The edge at B7 is worth a lot of points.]
;W[do];B[el]C[Again, the center is not so important in the endgame.]
;W[fl];B[dk];W[dl];B[ej];W[em];B[dj];W[ei];B[fj];W[eg];B[hl]
;W[ki];B[kk]C[Again better to play a big endgame move.];W[ph]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[ni];W[mj];B[lm];W[lk];B[ll];W[ng];B[oh];W[og]
;B[pg];W[nj];B[pi];W[pf];B[qg];W[pe];B[oe];W[of];B[qe];W[ne]
;B[mb];W[pa];B[mo];W[lp];B[gq];W[qr]C[White takes a big point!]
;B[rr];W[iq];B[fr];W[ho];B[go];W[io];B[gm];W[kj];B[hr];W[ir]
;B[cs];W[cr];B[es];W[bs];B[ds];W[bq];B[bm]C[Good!];W[bn];B[ag]
C[B13 is actually worth one more point.];W[gg];B[cb]C[Good!]
;W[bb];B[ba];W[ab];B[cm];W[dm];B[mk];W[lj];B[cl]C[This move is only worth 1 point. S1 is teh biggest point.]

[pb][ps][qa][qb][ra][rb][sa][sb]N[RESULT]C[I conducted the review with a focus on the first 50 moves as requested. However, I want to stress to importance of the endgame, especially in close matches like this one. I know you wanted to gain the clear lead early, but the chances to win the game went right until the very end. Improving your endgame will gain you at least 1 stone in strength.]

(;B[do];W[co];B[fo]C[This position is much stronger. You can sacrifice the D4 stones to create a strong center group.]
