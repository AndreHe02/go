(;B[ep]C[With the black formation on the right you might as well consider continuing with the chinese opening. See variations.]

(;B[id]C[Since white extened with a keima at the third line, playing at C18 firsta would probably be better... See variation.]

;W[nl];B[pg]LB[mj:A]C[I would rather jump to A. This continues your attack while expanding your moyo.]

(;B[ni]TR[ok][pk][qk]C[No reason to be timid;) The three triangled stones are strong and Q13 is close... O10 would be better. See variation]

;W[kd];B[if];W[kf];B[ff]TR[fc][jc][id][if]SQ[pb][pd][pg][ni]
[oi]C[Now the triangled group has defined a (very small) moyo but your influence from the squared stones is almost cancelled. Not a good exchange in my opinion.]
;W[mi];B[mg]C[Not an important point. White can connect anyway at L12.]
;W[me]
(;B[nd]C[Not a great point to play. See the variation for an alternative.]
;W[kh];B[kn]C[This move is a bit out of context. Always try to ask yourself what your moves accomplish. 
Does this move attack? 
No both white groups are safe. 
Does it make territory? 
Clearly no.
Does it defend? 
Not really... Your group in the bottom left which needs protection is not connected to the stone played.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[mp]C[So white exploites what started with L6 and makes you try to connect a not so important stone.]

(;B[hk]C[In this position one point left is better as it gives you a bit more space, see variation.]

Try to always think and re-think your strategy. 
Are you in danger somewhere?
What are the important points?
Can you attack while expanding?
Yours,
