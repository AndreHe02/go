C[bazzone [11k\]: hi
bazzone [11k\]: have a good game

topazg: Hi there, I'm Graham, and I'll be reviewing what I 
feel are the key points of this game particularly and 
Black's play generally :)];B[qd]C[omunegru [11k\]: hi
omunegru [11k\]: thanks
omunegru [11k\]: you too];W[dp];B[dd];W[pq];B[oc];W[jq]C[bazzone [11k\]: there is always the questions of where to 
go
bazzone [11k\]: i think i have a good idea though];B[qj]C[topazg: This is a bit low. Better to play at Q10 having made the perfect shimari above it. Still, the area is definitely correct - R10 is still a great move.]
;W[jc]
(;B[hc]C[bazzone [11k\]: what about this response? it seems like it turns out ok for black.

topazg: Because White can do a two space extension on each side, approaching at all is not very urgent, unless you really want to stop White from using one of them to approach you. For example, if White already had a stone at C14, you'd want to make sure White couldn't also now play around F17. As it is, you can tenuki. Q5 and C6 are both big moves now.

If you really want to play locally, the better response is M17 (see variation), as after the exchange in the top left White's group is still not fully settled and Black  threatens to make a huge number of points in the top right.]
;W[mc];B[dc]C[topazg: Too slow, you really don't want to end in gote like this. F17 would have been better than H17 if it would have made you more comfortable tenuki-ing here. Q5 and C6 still better.]
;W[hd];B[gd];W[ic];B[he]C[topazg: Good.];W[hb];B[id];W[gc];B[fc]

(;W[gb]
(;B[jd]C[topazg: Having got this far, this is too small. The influence isn't as big as other large edge and corner points, and White can't particularly hurt Black by playing here himself. Better to take advantage of your strenth in the corner.]
;W[kd];B[ke]C[topazg: Again, far too small unless Black has stones at, for example, D10 and K10. Ask yourself, what is Black actually earning in points from this? How does it compare to C10, C6, Q5, P15, P10 for actual points gained?

Responding should normally either be because you need to (urgent for your own group life) or because it is sente in profit (you gain from it locally _and_ your opponent must respond). There are reasons you may respond locally in gote where it is to prevent some other local disaster (such as your opponent being able to seal you in and retain sente), but responding for some non-urgent reason is rarely correct.]
;W[ld];B[le]C[bazzone [11k\]: w probably played back some there

topazg: Again, far too small - responding for no real gain.]
;W[me]
(;B[nd]C[topazg: This peep doesn't help much. If you are going to play locally, just dominate the corner and edge with P15 (See variation).]
;W[md];B[mf]C[topazg: Things are beginning to get unhappy for Black now. This influence is not earning you any points, and has some real weaknesses due to the H16 ko and the cut at M14. Not only that, but you are now forcing White into what should be your territory in the top right. Far better would be securing what you have in the top right - perhaps with P14 (as then it allows this move as a nice follow up) to make the most of that big corner.]
;W[pg];B[ne];W[pi]
(;B[qi]C[topazg: This is definitely the wrong side. You've just worked really hard at building influence at the top facing the middle, and now you are encouraging White to get a wall that will negate most of it. Force White to stay cramped (see variations).]
;W[qh]
(;B[qf]C[topazg: You have the weak group, not White - this is asking for trouble. settle first.]
;W[pf]
(;B[qg]C[topazg: S12 connects ... this makes Black's life much harder - White really wanted to get S12 as it keeps Black totally separated, and he's just been forced to play it.]
;W[rh];B[oh];W[ph];B[pj];W[oi];B[qo];W[oj]
(;B[nh]C[topazg: A disaster! Saving this stone is really not important at this stage. Q12 is not very strong, but it isn't that weak either. The R10 and R5 groups are much weaker, and you should be settling your groups before launching a concerted attack. Simply pull back to Q8 and remove your troubles first.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[qm];B[pl];W[pm]
(;B[ol]C[topazg: Capture is much better.];W[po]C[bazzone [11k\]: what went so wrong here?

topazg: O12 did :) Seriously, that move was a 40 point blunder or so, simply because you had such urgent moves required in this area. Weak groups cannot attack!]

(;B[rm]C[topazg: Don't half save lots of bits. Focus on saving the most important things, and save the others later if you can. By not capturing at P9 White can connect in sente, so you are probably better off capturing now and putting the urgency on White to defend his group. Locally, R3 has possibilities.]
;W[rn];B[rl];W[qn];B[qp];W[pp];B[qq];W[qr]C[topazg: now you have two unsettled groups (Ok, this one's dead, but you are actively trying to save both at once). It's surprising how often the winner is the person who can always have less weak heavy groups than his opponent. The value of settling weak groups so that you can attack forcefully cannot be understated.]
;B[rr];W[pr];B[qs];W[ps];B[sq];W[rp];B[ro];W[so];B[rq];W[rs]
;B[sp];W[sn];B[nk]C[topazg: Again, this is much less useful than capturing. Now White can connect and make miai of R8 and O8.]
;W[nj];B[mj];W[ok];B[ml];W[qe];B[re]C[topazg: R8 vital, better to let these two stones die.]
;W[pe];B[rf];W[ql];B[rj];W[ri];B[sk];W[sm];B[sl];W[si]C[topazg: White is now comfortably ahead in this game.]
;B[dl];W[ch]
(;B[di]C[topazg: Don't allow White to cut underneath you, it makes life too easy. Better to make it impossible for White to make eysepace from a slight distance. If White has invaded on the third line, a one point jump on either side is normally Black's key point - the side to pick is the one where Black is weakest, so C10 (see variations).]
;W[ci];B[cj];W[bj];B[ck];W[dh];B[ei];W[ce]
(;B[de]C[topazg: B16! Don't let White eat up your corner - lots of points in corners :)]
;W[cd];B[eh]C[topazg: Very big - and so's C17 - a hard choice now. Black now is reliant on the middle for this game as he has no real points elsewhere. White should be able to take K5 and let Black have the middle now.]
;W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[eg];W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[db];W[ii]C[bazzone [11k\]: this move drives me nuts.
bazzone [11k\]: i don't understand the strategy...im gonna put a stone right in the middle of his walls

topazg: Yes, a complete overplay. You are beaten if White can secure most of the bottom - there is no need for this nonsense ;)]

;B[kp];W[kq];B[jp]C[topazg: A phenomenal result - very nicely played at the bottom :)]
;W[ik];B[jj];W[ij];B[jk]C[topazg: Not needed, the peep was enough. Take J7 and start enclosing in a big way.]
;W[im];B[jl]C[topazg: Locally correct. White's getting a big wall now though.]
;W[il];B[gk];W[jm];B[km]C[topazg: You aren't the one needing eyes, you are trying to kill. Keep removing eyespace only. M6 on this side, G7 on the other, H12 at the top. You don't need to contact White to prevent White from getting eyes.]

(;W[er];B[dq];W[dr];B[cq]C[topazg: So, the main things from my point of view were:

1) Generally, the reason both players made the biggest errors in this game were due to trying to juggle too many weak groups at the same time. Fortunately, because both of you did it, things were reasonably well balanced. It is very important if you have two weak groups near to each other, to pick the most important one and settle it - if you get the chance to settle the other afterwards, then great, but if your opponent takes an extra move to kill it, at least you saved one group and got sente to make up for losing the other. Always be prepared to throw away 3 or 4 stone groups for the initiative or because you can steal more points away elsewhere.

2) A burning desire to respond locally. the moves along J16->N14 really earned Black very little at the time. The influence wasn't insignificant, but it wasn't that great either, and you were making sure White lived with territory at the top, which is reasonably compensating. Take every opportunity you can to say "I think I can do better than responding to that - I reckon playing over here is worth more". The winner in Go is also very often the person who decides to be the one calling the shots most of the time.]
