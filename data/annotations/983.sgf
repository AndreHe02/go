8-Jan-2000];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[mc]MA[pj][jc][jd]C[This is too short to be a good extension and too far to secure
the corner well.  The Xs show some of the good extensions available.

Playing on the 4x4 point makes it very hard to secure the corner
from a 3x3 invasion.  If you start out on 4x4 points, be willing
to accept a corner invasion and use it to build up one side in
exchange.];W[nq];B[qm]TR[jp][jq][kp][kq]MA[pm]C[too defensive?

No.  Some response needs to be made to white's approach move.
Either pincer at one of the triangles or extend up the side at
7 or the X];W[pq];B[qq];W[oq];B[qo]LB[nq:6][oq:10][pq:8][qq:9]
[qm:7]MA[lp][lq]C[This exchange favors black.  The white stones are vulnerable
to an attack at one of the marked points while black is secure.]
;W[qf];B[qg]TR[qd]MA[pi][ph]C[Black should not play a contact move here.  The white stone is
weak and a contact fight will tend to strengthen it.  The areas
marked with Xs are better to start surrounding white while securing
the right side.  Playing at the triangle secures the corner for
black.];W[rg];B[re]TR[qg]C[That wasn't very bright, was it?

Black should extend from the marked stone to get more liberties.
Black has started a contact fight and then played away before
the marked stone was secure.  Once a contact fight has started,
don't quit until your stones are secure.  Secure means 5 liberties
or the ability to connect to some group with 5 liberties.  It
is possible to leave with less than 5 if your opponent has 2
liberties less than you.];W[qh];B[pg];W[qk]C[White now has a small base on the right side.]
;B[pk]MA[kp][fq][cn][dj][cf][fc]C[Black should attack this group eventually, but playing elsewhere
is worth more now.  This is still the opening and move 19 is
a middle game attack.  The Xs are some of the opening moves that
still should be played.];W[pj];B[oi]C[The same thing again... I let myself set in atari.

Once a contact fight is started, continue until your groups have
5 liberties.  If you have the potential to connect groups for
a total of 5 liberties, this counts.];W[pl];B[ok];W[pi];B[ph]
;W[rh]LB[ph:25][ok:23][pl:22][pk:19][qk:18][pj:20][pi:24][oi:21]
C[This exchange favors white.  White's group is now secure and
has some territory.  Black has 3 weak groups facing the middle
and no secure territory.]
(;B[jc]MA[fc][gc]C[This is rather small and should be closer to the upper left corner.
If black plays on one of the Xs, then white will probably defend
the corner.  Then black could play right below 27 on the star
point.  This would give most of the top edge to black.  See the
variation.];W[fc];B[hc]C[This is too small.  Black should play elsewhere.  Moves 27 and
29 are too close and just one stone in this area would accomplish
about as much.];W[ce]TR[cg][dj][cn]MA[cc]C[This is a small move for white.  It doesn't secure the corner
well nor does it secure much of the side.  Black could invade
at the X or play on the left side at one of the triangles.  Invading
the corner should be saved until all of the opening moves on
the left side and bottom are played, however.];B[rf];W[sg];B[om]
;W[oj];B[nj]MA[pf][oh][ol]C[This move leaves too many small groups that could be cut apart.
A more solid, connecting move like one of the Xs would be better.
Black can't keep white out of the center in any case];W[nk]
;B[ol];W[ni]TR[nj][oi]C[Atari two stones.]
(;B[oh]TR[qg][pg][ph]MA[mj]C[My mistake: I didn't notice the atari.

Since this is a double atari, black has to choose one stone to
sacrifice.  Black made the best choice of the two since playing
39 at X would let white play at 39 and threaten the three marked
stones.  See variation];W[mj];B[mn]TR[fq][lp][lq][dj][cn]MA[no]
C[Locally, X links to the black corner stones better and prevents
white from playing at X.  See variation for a possible sequence
of white playing at X.

Globally, black should be playing one of the traingles.]

[mp:43][lp:42][mn:41]TR[pq][oq][nq]C[This exchange favors white.  The white group at the bottom has
acquired more territory (on the edge) than black has in the middle.
The 3 white stones were weak but now they are not.  The black
stones were strong and are not really stronger now.  An attack
often strengthens the opponent.];W[fq]TR[cn]MA[iq]C[Black should not let white secure the lower left corner without
a fight.  An invasion at X or an approach at the triangle is
in order.  The invasion is more complex and risky, so the approach
is best for a  high kyu player.  The variation has an example
of an invasion.]
(;B[ge]C[Here I'm trying to get into the center

The black stones on the top already face the center well enough.
Don't worry much about the center until the sides are spoken
for.];W[eg];B[gg];W[cn]LB[eg:50][gg:51][ge:49]TR[hc][pd][mc]
[jc]MA[ng][mg][lg][kg][jg][ig][hg]C[White has gained a lot of side territory with this exchange and
black still has a huge gap, marked by Xs, to close before there
will be any real territory below the marked stones.];B[mh];W[nh]
;B[ng];W[pf];B[og];W[of];B[ne];W[nf];B[mg];W[qc]TR[rf][re][pd]
[ne]SQ[qf][pf][of][nf]C[My following defensive moves were not good. Why?

This corner has never been tightly secured.  Both of white's
corners are similarly vulnerable.  White should be able to live
in the upper right.  Don't plan to kill white.  Instead, squeeze
white into a tiny life while connecting the marked black stones.
This will kill the row of marked white stones and gain enough
for black to make the exchange worth while.]
(;B[rc]TR[qf][pf][of][nf]MA[qd]C[X cuts the white invasion off from the marked stones.  See the
variation.];W[qd];B[pb]TR[rf][re]MA[qe]C[X helps connect the marked black stones to their fellows.  It
also seperates the white groups];W[rd];B[sd]TR[rc]MA[qe]C[The marked stone should be abandoned and black should play at
X.];W[rb];B[qe];W[pe]TR[pe][qf][pf][of][nf]SQ[rf][re][qe]MA[mf]
C[This is now a race to capture one of the two marked groups.  Both groups have 2 liberties, so whoever plays first will win.
Black at X will capture the 5 white stones.  See the variation.]

(;B[me]C[Trying to make a box shape];W[sf]TR[pe][qf][pf][of]
[nf]SQ[rf][re][qe]MA[mf]C[Now white has 2 liberties to black's 1.  X is still a good move
since it keeps white out of black's potential territory to the
left of the X.];B[jg];W[mf];B[lf];W[se];B[ki]MA[pc][od][le]
[lg]C[more of the center

There are too many cutting points for white to take advantage
of.  Black should solidify this area by playing on one of the
marked points.];W[fi];B[gi];W[gj];B[hj];W[hi];B[gh];W[hk];B[ij]
TR[hi]C[This stone will be my doom in the endgame];W[fk]LB[gh:83]
[ij:85][hk:84][hj:81][gj:80][hi:82][gi:79][fi:78]C[This exchange gives white much more terriotry on the side than
it does black in the center.  Black's center can still be reduced
quite a bit with the cutting points noted previously. An invasion
of the left side is now difficult.]
(;B[ik]MA[cj]C[The variation shows a possible invasion of the left side at X]
;W[cq]C[Now the lower left corner is secure from invasion.]
;B[hl];W[gk];B[im]TR[pi][pj][nh][ni][oj][nk][mj]SQ[jp][hp][fm]
CR[lp][fq][cc][iq][jq][cj]MA[ll]C[Again too defensive?

This move doesn't accomplish much.  Black is trying to surround
center territory, but the stones marked with triangles should
allow white to reduce the center dramatically.  Playing at X
would start to secure the center from white.  The squares show
plays that aim to reduce white's territory.  Circles mark invasion
points.  Imagine a line between the two white stones marked with
circles.  That is a "sector line".  Any play below the sector
line is an invasion.  A play above it is a light reduction.]

It is a large defect to cover with one stone.];W[ml];B[mi];W[nj]

C[This exchange is Gote and changes the final score by only 2 or
3 points.  There are other moves worth more in Sente.  The Xs
are two possibilities.  The triangle is still a good way to secure
the center from white.];W[lm]C[White's invading and eating my space]

and black must be ready to respond.];W[jk];B[jj]
(;W[qj]TR[pl][ql][rk][qk]C[White connects the large center group.  This move is important
since a black cut here later would capture the marked stones.

filled, however.  See the variation.];B[qr];W[pr];B[ps];W[os]
