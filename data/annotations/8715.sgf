AB[pd][dp][pp]C[The main issue I want to explore in this review is how to most effectively utilize thickness.

Hi, my name is Kheng Hun and I will be using kh: to indicate my comments.
Although thickness is important, i think that thickness may not always help you win the game. You can try to utilize your thickness well though if your opponent helps you form thickness. Playing thickly in handicap games also helps.]

At this point it should be easy for Black to win by a hefty sum.  White has gained virtually no territory in exchange for blacks influence.  I was abe to manage a win, but by much narrower margins than this stage would suggest.

kh: black looks ahead, very strong influence on the right.]

djllap [8k\]: thank you


At this point White resigned being less than 5 points behind on the board.

kh: just a correction, black wins by 8.5.

Thank you for your aid in reviewing this game for me!

kh: to conclude, in the end, your thickness was used quite well. However, you should try to settle the black dragon on the left early to avoid getting counter attacked. Move 48 could have been a game loosing move. however, you still managed to attack quite well so you could still win. But settling all groups quickly when you have great thickness is a good strategy since you can attack your opponent's groups without worry.

Just a sidenote, read more on fuseki and in the endgame, think about the value of each move before you make them.
Some tesujis in endgame may just change the game.];W[ii];B[oc]
