;B[gq]MA[ep][fq]C[i'm curious about the opening, i waited to take the corner which helped me get a double wing, but it appears it gave white sente. is there anything better i could have done?

J: In the opening, sente will be traded a couple times; in exchange you should grabe the largest point.

J: G3 at the marked points are normal.   there is a weakness at e3 fo white to exploit later.]
;W[dj];B[qg];W[od];B[og]C[is this too slow? should i have done a double jump or a knight's move in?

J: Yes.  Those suggestions are ok.  A more active move would be the Tengen (center) point, it's the biggest in this situation.]
;W[ro]C[J: An interesting probe.  It's not a bad move but it's actually a detriment for white to spend more moves in this area without backup.]
;B[rp];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm];B[so];W[qm];B[md]C[i wanted to reduce white's area, but i think i may have been better attacking the r7 group or preventing the slide under at s10

J: A good plan here would be to attack the R7 group SO that you can reduce the top.  As white runs, the Q10 groupd will naturally get stronger.]
;W[nc]MA[ne][me][nf]C[J: White is submissive here, consider marked point to try to separate black.]
;B[kd]MA[nf][ne]C[J: a slow move.  it splits white into two strong groups, and leaves a weakness in the marked area.]
;W[ne];B[lf]C[would m13 be better here?

J: Either is fine because of how weak L16 is.  Just make sure Q10 is safe.]
;W[po];B[pp];W[om];B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[lp];B[kq]MA[mn][ko][jn]
C[J: Another submissive move.  Maybe marked points instead.]
;W[mm]
(;B[gc]C[J: Feels low.  normally a low moves tries to make a base a base.  But when there are so many white stones already low, a simple reduction maybe better.  See variation.]
;W[id];B[ge];W[hd]C[J: White shoul omit this peep.  Waste of  ko-threat.]
;B[gd];W[if];B[gg];W[hf];B[gf];W[lb];B[dg]MA[cg][dh]C[J: given such a large wall, black can be even more aggressive at the marked points.  D13 is a pretty mild reduction.]
;W[mg];B[kg];W[me];B[le]C[J: m15 is a waste of a move.  N16 is no longer a cutting stone, so it's unimportant.]
;W[lc];B[ld];W[ng];B[mi]C[J: N11 is weirdly placed, it neither helps L13 to run or Q10.]
;W[lh];B[jh];W[li];B[mj];W[of];B[oh];W[nk];B[nh]C[J: Black is already connected.  Given the fact that black has so many weak groups, black should spend this one solidifying S10 or keep attacking P7 group.]
;W[kj];B[lk];W[mk];B[lj]C[J: right now, if black runs, with m10 group, it will hurt k12 group.]
;W[kh];B[jf];W[nn];B[mo]C[J: black can't afford to answer here; should run one of the groups instead.]
;W[ll];B[kk];W[jj];B[ln];W[jk];B[kl];W[lm]C[J: this result is horrible for black.  Both groups still need more moves to live.]
;B[dl]C[J: black can't afford to tenuki yet.  Also, this is the wrong place to try to attack white.  if D13 was a D12, then black would have more possiblities here.]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[ck];B[ji];W[hh];B[hg];W[ig];B[jg];W[ih];B[ii]
;W[ki];B[fh];W[gi]C[this all got messy. any tips or pointers?

J: It's good to recognize whe you have two running weak groups.  White has one very strong group.   In this situation, it's good to quickly settle one early on; say with S10.

J: D8 has also solidified C9 group, and it's harder for d13 to make eyes.]
;B[hi];W[gh];B[hk];W[il];B[ik];W[jl];B[ci]C[J: Black still neds to save both groups.]
;W[cj];B[dd]C[was there a better move here?

J: black suddenly has 3 weak groups.  normally, one or two will die.  D18 also has some complicated branches.]

;W[oj];B[mh];W[fk]C[J: white should attack from the bottom instead.  that way, black should die.]

J: Thanks for showing me this game.  The main take-away here should be not to be submissive, and be to look out for possible situations when there are more than one weak group.]
