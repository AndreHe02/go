C[Dear reviewer,

Thank you for your time I played white in this game. I usually am not very strong when playing white. Since I am not quite good in invasion.

I think the game was quite close all the way and I had some bad endgame mistakes that might decide the game. However, I am interested to get feedback on how to improve my opening/middlegame to get better moves and take the lead.

Thank you,
Vinyoo

Hi, Vinyoo, 

this is Bernd, HonFu in the GTL and other Go places. Let's see what we've got here. 

First some pointers about what you said:

1.) You don't have to invade a lot with white. Moyos usually look bigger than they are. Don't forget than you get komi! More often than not you would rather reduce than invade anyway.

2.) There is no such thing as moves that will give you the lead! The natural character of go is the close game. You can only get the lead if your opponent makes a mistake. 

Okay, but let's look at the game!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq]
;W[dn];B[jp];W[ce]LB[pj:A][qj:B][qn:C]C[Hon: This is probably a playable move, but if you don't like invasions, you should play at B or C instead. If not, black can take A and you will most likely be forced to invade later.]
;B[jc];W[qj];B[ql];W[qf];B[rd]C[I think is is a too defensive move for black, but I cannot find a good punishment. If I play O17, black invasion at R12 looks severe to me.

Hon: If your opponent makes no serious mistake like creating several weak groups or something, it is not easy to punish him. Maybe it takes a high dan to do it properly. 

If you can't see a clear way to punish, just assume that your opponent has not played bad, but just something that you don't know. Go on with a natural move.]
;W[of];B[nd]LB[rd:B][ph:A]TR[of]C[Hon: Looks okay. Personally I prefer A instead of the marked stone.

Now black has already played B, which might be a bit early. You have sente to do something else.]
;W[qq]C[Is this invasion premature? I think it is the time since black can take the corner if I don't invade now.

Hon: There would still be aji after another black move there, but I think you can enter there.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]
;B[nq]LB[ql:A][rm:B]TR[qm]C[Hon: Black A looks very strange now - almost meaningless. Black should have blocked at C instead of the marked stone.]
;W[hq];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr]
(;W[cp]C[Hon: This seems to weaken G3.];B[br];W[bq];B[cr];W[fp]
(;B[iq]C[Hon: This looks bad. Black could aim at cutting your stone off; instead he protects a few points of territory and makes your stone "light".]
;W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq]C[I think this sequence was good for me since I got sente, didn't it?

Hon: I don't know if it was the best sequence, but getting solid in sente looks good to me. J3 was a mistake.]
;W[hc];B[ee];W[fd]LB[df:A]C[I am not sure if this is the wrong move. Please advise.

Hon: It's one of the two normal answers (the other is A). Since you want to prevent H17 from getting cut off, this looks natural.]
;B[cf]C[May be better at B14?]
(;W[de]C[Hon: This move is more often bad than good. You eat the "hane at the end of two stones", so you help his shape.]
(;B[ed];W[ec];B[fe]
(;W[gd];B[df]C[Hon: It's a pity that black can fix his shape.]
(;W[di];B[bi]
(;W[eg]C[I think this is the wrong direction. Should I play C10 instead?

Hon: C10 looks passive to me, like just what black wants.];B[ck]
;W[ef]C[Hon: Good. Stick to your plans.];B[ch]C[Hon: Again you get sente ...]
;W[lc]C[Hon: ... and thereby the chance to do the largest thing on the board.]
;B[ld];W[mc]C[I generally do not play invasion very well. What should be the best move for this situation?

Hon: Depends on the situation. What you are doing here looks natural.]
;B[nc];W[nb];B[ob];W[md];B[me];W[kd];B[le];W[kc];B[ke]
(;W[je];B[nf]
(;W[oe];B[ne];W[ng]C[This is quite a bad move. Maybe I should play K13 or P13 instead.

P13 looks good locally, and K14 is a great (and consistent) move after black did not take K14. E16 then should die a natural death.]
;B[jf];W[ie];B[pg]C[Hon: This looks like a bad move - black peeps where he could cut.]
(;W[qg];B[og];W[re]LB[qe:B][pf:A]C[Hon: A or B looks better to me. This is an invitation for B.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj];W[rk];B[jm]C[Hon: Quite a success for black.]
;W[jj]C[Maybe too shallow? Should I play L9 and try to live inside black area?

Hon: To find out, you have to count points. Reducing shallowly as you do, on the "doorstep" of the moyo, is the natural thing to do. But if you are behind, you can't. So always count points and find out what is necessary.]

(;B[kb]C[Hon: Okay let us end here.

I think you have a good feeling for reasonable play in general. You build solid shapes, don't overdo things, take sente at the right moment ... still there were a few mistakes which you might want to erase. (Black has made more mistakes though.)

You lost a lot of points in the endgame. Endgame as an area of Go is valuable to study - especially since almost noone seems to do it. Basically you have to concentrate, count and plan, but there are also some good books which you can buy and read:

"The Endgame" (Ogawa/Davies)
"Get Strong at the Endgame" (Bozulich)

Getting skillful at the endgame might complement your solid, reasonable style of play, so you should seriously consider studying it!]

Either you cut B10 off or black gets his base taken.
