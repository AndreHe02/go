C[Dear reviewer,
I play White in this game.
I added some questions.
Please show me,
where I missed chances
Thanks for your time.

It's an interesting game - you did well to fight it out towards the end to make it close because i think that you were in a tough spot in the middle game. 

If I had a couple of general comments, they would be:
1) you don't need to save ALL your stones - playing through the game, it seems as though you are unwilling to let any of your stones die. Sacrificing stones for strategic gain is a mark of good play.
2) try to take into account the whole board. It's easy to say, and tough to do, but you seem to lack a sense of making your groups work together on a bigger scale.]

with your formation on the left, and black's enclosure, an extension on the left side is urgent for both of you, and probably the most important spot now.]

;B[qg]C[another ugly looking invasion from black];W[qf]C[to defend the corner

yup];B[qi]C[The next 20-30 moves are a bit of a disaster, where you end up with some very fragmented unco-ordinated groups. Although the moves you make look ok on a local level, the whole board result is not good. 

It's probably worth having a think about what bigger strategic aims you could have. One idea that strikes me is to leave R10 for now (and maybe use its aji later) but to play from the Q14 stones to ensure that black's top group is kept separate and attackable.]

;W[oe];B[nf];W[ne];B[mf];W[me];B[ok]TR[ni][qj][jp]C[The bottom half of the board is where black has invested more moves than you. As a matter of principle, where you are weak vs. the opponent you should be looking to 
1) avoid making weak groups where possible (black's extra stones will get even stronger)
2) avoid fighting (that will help black to use his extra stregnth)
3) try to settle groups as soon as possible (avoid letting things get attacked)

As we will see, you soon get involved in trying to defend the three marked groups. I've seen it mentioned that you should try to only have one weak group at a time on the board, so three is obviously a problem!]

What are your plans for the rest of the game? You have made a little territory in one corner (group A), you have a group with some ouside influence (group E) and three weak, pointless groups (B, C, D).

It's hard to see what the strategic use of any of the last three groups is - they're not going to make any territory and B and D especially are so weak, that they will likely hamper your efforts to attack the black group in the top. From here you really need to try to settle the three groups, and then maybe try to develop some territory using group E maybe. It's going to be a tough game for you]
