C[Hi Serkan,

My name is Greg. I have put many comments and variations in the game. Please have a look.

Overall, if I had to name an area specifically where you need to work on, I would say shape. You messed up a few shape points in the game, and that led to white being able to attack you more easily. 

Shape is a little difficult to study. My recommendation is actually replaying pro games of pros who are more known for their solidity or ability to live. Cho Chikun would be a good place to start. If you're looking for a more modern player, I might recommend Park Junghwan. If you can, everyone now and then just replay a few games. Pro's shape is usually great and hopefully you can try and replicate it in your game. There are a few books if your willing to buy books, but I'll leave that up to you.

Cheers!];B[pd]C[fabric [2k\]: hi

(;B[np]C[This move is often considered to be not good for black. The usual situations one would play O4 is either if you need to make shape, or you need to overconcentrate white. Either way, this needlessly strengthens white, and the the result is generally considered better for white locally. See variations. Note how in none of them do I attach to the white stone.]

;W[lj]
(;B[cp]C[I was indecisive on this move, what shold I do ?

Greg: This kind of move is always difficult to answer isn't it. The key point to think about is do I cut my losses and solidify what I have, or do I try to attack? If it were me here, I would probably do what you did. The stone is a little too far, and your is shape a little too weak to get any benefit out of a ttacking. I think your move was fine. It's hard for white to go in too much further without attacking anyways, and later on, this may become a weak group for white.

However, I might choose a different approach, you don't really want to get sealed into the corner here. C5 looks better to me. See variation.]
;W[dn];B[ci]C[I don't like this a lot. Playing elsewhere after D6 is usually a little dangerous.After B5, the corner becomes quite large. See variation.]

(;W[oi];B[oj];W[ni]
(;B[pi]C[Locally, I would play different here. I refer playing a little looser to avoid issues with the O16 weakness. See variation.]
;W[of];B[pg];W[og];B[pf];W[nd];B[ne];W[oe];B[oh]C[This wedge isn't very good. Your stones on the right are strong and your territory is safe. What's more important are the stones at the top. You did keep sente with this, but you made white stronger on the outside without gaining much at all on the inside.]
;W[nh];B[ph];W[mg]
(;B[jd]C[I thinks this shape was bad and later cause difficulties for me , was directly j17 better maybe ?

Greg: Agreed. I think this is the losing move. White got to attack this group too nicely later. J17 would be good. If you're looking for shape, L15 would be the move. See variations.]
;W[hc]C[This move hurts doesn't it.];B[hd]C[This is a nice move.]
;W[gc];B[jg];W[ji];B[cf]C[I might be tempted to try and take a little more here. However, I don't see an easy way to do that, since you really need sente to play in the bottom left as well. I guess this is necessary. My thought here is playing C15 is also interesting.]
