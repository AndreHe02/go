[jp]C[I think this is a bit passive... but certainly nothing wrong.];B[dj]
C[B can consider play Q6. W is strong around that corner. if w gets to attack, B will be difficult. On the other hand. after B Q6. if W play D10, than O3 exchange for Q6 become a bad move. B can play C3 at that position. and W's K4-O3 is considered not effient in that case.]
;W[ql]C[R6 would be better. not allowing B corner any space.];B[cn];W[fp]
C[it will be interesting if W play something like P5. but this is also fine, just a bit passive.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[qn]C[this is why R8 was not so good.];W[nc]C[this is a bit strange. O8 looks more urgent.]
;B[qj];W[ol]C[a bit too late. W can consider give up R8 at this situation. as B still need another move to secure it. W can take the sente to get some profit on the top.

(for example O15, B Q14, W R17 looks pretty good )];B[nj]C[can consider P17, if W O16 than Q14. making 2 weak W group and at the meantime, getting territory on the top-right side. that would work better with the R10 move.]
;W[pb]C[W can consider taking R17 here.];B[nd]C[B can also consider play R17 here.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[lc];B[oc];W[ob];B[le];W[qd];B[qe];W[rd]C[W gets nice profit on the corner. and B's a bit weak outside. W can be happy at this point.]
;B[pe]C[this might be a bit slow. should attack the two W stone immediately. or B can play S15 to seal off the corner.]
;W[re]C[this is big. but W O5 looks very nice now. can leave S15 to a little later.]
;B[ml]C[maybe start with O4 is a little better.];W[pn];B[po];W[on];B[np]
;W[rn];B[qo]C[W gets good shape in this exchange.];W[mp]C[maybe better just play N3.]
;B[no];W[qm];B[mq];W[lq];B[mr];W[lr];B[nr]C[B gets some good profit here. can consider make the N5 M4 exchange first.]
;W[me];B[mf];W[nf]C[this spot to cut is a little questionable. W looks better cutting from M14.]
;B[ld];W[mc];B[mg];W[oi];B[oj];W[qf];B[og]C[B capture the cutting stone nicely. W sort of helped B to gain thickness in the center. W's gain on R14 limited.]
;W[em]C[protecting the corner at B4 looks more natural.];B[ro];W[sm];B[rk]
C[this is B's rights. but should keep it. as Both S10 and S9 are good threat. should leave for later use.]
;W[rl];B[so];W[sn];B[cq]C[B happy to take the corner.];W[cp];B[bp];W[dq]
;B[br];W[cr];B[bq];W[ch];B[ef]C[B can consider taking another corner at C17.]
;W[cj]C[coming out at E12 looks easier for W to play.];B[ck];W[di]C[I don't like W's move here. I would try B9 or even a cut at D9.]
;B[bj];W[bi]C[this KO looks pointless. on the other hand. B has good spacing between the lower left corner and the three black stones fighting the KO. B can just take the C17 corner and leave the KO alone.]
;B[ci];W[dg];B[df];W[cj];B[sk];W[mm];B[ci];W[ei];B[gf];W[hi];B[nm]C[B maybe better just leave this place alone?]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[lm];B[mo];W[nl]C[B can't be happy with the way W is getting into center.]
;B[hk];W[cj]C[why not play E10. W a bit too defensive here?];B[hm]C[B bold.]
;W[ig];B[if]C[B should either take the corner or play G16.];W[hg];B[hf]
C[W gained here.];W[gl]C[maybe W J8, B H8, than W E9 is a better attack?]
;B[jk]C[B good move here.];W[hl];B[il];W[ij]C[J10 looks bad. I would just cut from J7. take the profit first and see what B can do. W weak groups are not easy to kill.]
;B[kn];W[lk]C[should playN9 first, B M8 than W L7. letting B play N9 W's group looks very dangrous now.]
;B[mk];W[km];B[jm];W[jn];B[ln];W[sl];B[ll]C[I think B Q9 looks like a kill. at least W can't make 2 eyes, and doesn't seemed to be much room to run in the center.]
;W[kl];B[kk];W[om];B[pk];W[pl];B[in];W[lj];B[jo];W[ip]C[W M11, letting B take R5 looks very bad.]
;B[qg];W[pf]C[W need to play B16, the corner is very big.];B[of];W[rg];B
[pg];W[rh];B[rf];W[sf];B[pc];W[qc];B[cc]C[finally! this wins the game for B.]
;W[be]C[this a bit strange.];B[cd]C[B maybe better off playing B16.];W[ce]
;B[de];W[bf];B[ed];W[jb];B[kc];W[kb];B[ec]C[B feels somewhat cheated here. having to secure the corner in gote. But the corner is still huge.]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[bn];B[bo];W[bl];B[an];W[cl];B[fb]C[J9 looks big too.];W[mj]
;B[ni]C[I think B should be able to connet the 3 stones here.];W[nk];B[ik]
;W[id]C[this move strange. better at G18 if W wants to play here. G9 looks big.]
;B[gc];W[je];B[kf];W[gk];B[lp];W[jr]C[L3 is a better move for W.];B[dr]
;W[er];B[cs];W[es];B[bd]C[B getting all the huge end game moves. again. W too passive.]
;W[cg]C[W play B13 is a litte better I think.];B[ae];W[bg];B[al];W[ak];B
[am];W[aj];B[hd];W[jc];B[kd];W[hc];B[hb]C[just J15 is better.];W[ic];B[ie]
;W[gd]C[now W gets something here.];B[fd];W[he];B[dn];W[fg]C[this is bigger than D6. B should played F12 first.]
;B[hj];W[gi];B[gj];W[fj];B[gm];W[fm];B[kp];W[jg]C[this is not very big. L3 might be bigger]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[jq];W[iq];B[dm];W[dl];B[qh];W[mh];B[nh];W[lg];B[kg];W[kh]
;B[jf];W[jj];B[kj];W[ki];B[ri];W[qf];B[ge];W[ho];B[hd];W[gn]C[W E5 better.]
;B[eo];W[fo];B[ep];W[eq];B[ib];W[en];B[ja];W[lb];B[do];W[ff]C[W M1 bigger.]
;B[gg];W[eg];B[ee];W[gh];B[ls];W[si];B[sj];W[sh];B[ks];W[ir];B[lf];W[qk]
