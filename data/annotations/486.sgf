Comments by David Swan "DS:"  cygnus 10k* on IGS];B[pc];W[qp]
;B[cd];W[do];B[op]C[DS: I don't know all the joseki moves, but from what I have seen in pro-pro games I think B would aim first at D3 before playing the kakari at P4. W usually would find time to play D3 too or extend up the left side.

  A move on the 4th line like D5 really aims at influence on the side and toward the center rather than corner.]
;W[pn];B[kp]C[DS: A bit wide.  Leaves a nice invasion point at N4 for W to aim at.]
;W[qe]C[DS: OK, but considering the whole board, I think W should make shimari in lower left corner first.]
;B[pe];W[pf];B[oe];W[qd];B[qc]C[DS: nice solid moves. B looks good here and making nice thickness toward corner and Upper side.]
;W[qi];B[of];W[pg];B[jd]C[DS: Ok, might consider J16 or J17 as the thickness on left is a bit close.]
;W[ec]
(;B[dc]C[DS: this move is better when B is on Star point.  A better move would be to pincer W at G17 instead.  This would attack W and help to create a huge moyo for B on the upper side.  See variation.]
;W[hc];B[ed];W[fc];B[jb]C[DS: much too early for playing on the second line like this.  A play at K17 would be better for your purpose.  This would create an "iron pillar" that is thicker and would make invasion more difficult for W at M17.]
;W[ci]C[DS: W might consider a forcing move at D15 first.];B[fd]
;W[gd];B[cg];W[ei];B[ge];W[he];B[gf];W[hf];B[jf]C[DS: B could also force first at J16 or aim at G 18 to rob W of a secure base.  However, B might also continue with pushing at G13.]
;W[kc];B[jc]C[DS: This is just what W wanted.  B should consider playing at L16 then letting W push through and then play M17.]
;W[nc]C[DS: O17 is the vital point.];B[hg]C[DS: B should not ignore W at O17]
;W[ig];B[if];W[le];B[gb]C[DS: Now you have the idea, but the timing is wrong.  B should try to push at L17 first.]
;W[hb];B[gc];W[hd];B[fb];W[hh];B[gg];W[gh];B[jg];W[pd];B[oc]
C[DS: good move.  Playing P16 would be walking into a trap.]
;W[od];B[nd];W[md]C[DS: unfortunately B's P15 group is now in a heap of trouble.]
;B[mc]C[DS: at this point B needs to play lightly if he expects to save the P15 group.  consider N14  or N13]
;W[ne];B[nb];W[mg];B[nf]C[DS: B trapped in a net now :(];W[mf]
;B[nd];W[me];B[ih];W[no];B[np]C[DS: W's right side moyo is huge!]
;W[pr]C[DS: too early for a 2nd line play like this.];B[oq]
C[DS: no. This is an inefficient move.  see the empty triangle?  usually is a poor move ( but there are exceptions.) Consider a kakari at D3 or E3 or a reducing move at Q10.  A move  trying to reduce W's moyo on the Right could use the aji of B's P14 group for support.]
;W[dq]C[DS: W finally gets the shimari in the corner.  This is a very large move. W is ahead so far even here.  B could try a reducing move at Q10 or try an invasion on the left side.]
;B[gq];W[ip];B[iq];W[gp]
(;B[dk]C[Pushing up at H4 will create two cutting points in W's wall. These could have significant aji later on.  Also, a better invasion point is at C7 instead. Fourth line plays like this aim at center influence and B will find it harder to gain a stable base on the side.  Either way B will find the fight hard.]
;W[cl];B[fk];W[hj];B[fh];W[fi];B[gi];W[hi];B[gj];W[ck]C[DS: B's F9 group is almost completely surrounded now.]
;B[hk];W[ij];B[ik];W[jj]C[DS: Good. B is attacking the center W group and gaining eye space or potential for linking up with L4]
;B[jk];W[kj];B[jn];W[jp];B[ko];W[hq];B[hr];W[hp]C[DS: now it is B who has the cutting points at G2 and J2.]
;B[jq];W[mo];B[mp];W[kk]C[DS: This is a huge move. W is now putting a lid on the  Right side moyo. W is now way ahead unless B can make something happen.]
;B[kl];W[ll];B[km];W[gr];B[ir];W[fq];B[dj];W[di];B[pq];W[qq]
;B[qr]C[DS: this is an error.  W could also just play at P2 and attack B's underbelly.]
;W[rr];B[or];W[oo]C[DS: W should capture at R1 instead.];B[qs]
;W[pp];B[lm];W[ml];B[mm];W[nl];B[nm];W[om];B[rs];W[rq];B[hn]
C[DS: too small.  How about E6?];W[gn];B[gm];W[fn];B[fm];W[em]
;B[nh]C[DS: B cannot save his O14 group.  This forcing move would be ok, but it has to have some reason behind it. Earlier B could have used this kind of move to invade, but in the light of W's solid wall this is too little too late.]
;W[ng];B[mh]C[DS: too heavy.  When trying this kind of play B needs to try for sabaki and play lightly. A better play would be at N10 then M11? Either way it will be very hard for B to live inside.]
;W[lh];B[li];W[lj];B[lg];W[kh];B[ki];W[ji];B[mi];W[kg];B[kf]
C[DS: I think it might have been better for B to cut at K12 instead.  This would allow the aji of squeezing the W group below it.]
;W[jh]C[DS: now B has the N12 group almost dead too.];B[lf]
;W[ok];B[oh]C[DS: These moves are certainly forcing ones, but near worthless as B's group is essentially dead.]
;W[og];B[nj];W[ek];B[ej];W[el];B[fj];W[eh];B[fg];W[lc]
(;B[kb]C[DS: B could have linke up by playing M18 instead.  See variation.]
;W[lb];B[eg];W[mb];B[nc];W[rc];B[rb];W[ka];B[ja];W[la];B[pa]
C[DS: I think it would be better shape to have moved at R19 instead. But first B should have played S16 to secure the group.]
;W[kd];B[je];C[DS: Playing L15 creates a false eye for W and still links up fine and increases B's territory by one point.]
;W[rd];B[pb]C[DS: this just gives away points when you play inside your own territory.  Studying Life and Death problems and Tesuji will help you learn when a group is alive as stands or needs reinforcements.]
;W[cj];B[dg];W[dl];B[fl];W[im];B[in];W[jl];B[jm];W[hm]C[DS: W's moves here are futile, but may create ko threats if needed. however, I don't see much that would develop into a ko at this time.]
;B[qo];W[po];B[rn];W[qn];B[rm];W[pj];B[ro];W[rk];B[ql];W[pk]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[qk];W[qj];B[rj];W[ri];B[sk];W[sj];B[sl]C[DS: B seems desperate here.  I don't see anyway for B to live on the Right side.

As B is dead anyway, B should take sente to make the big endgame moves NOW.  i.e. B12 is a double sente point worth about 8 points.]
;W[bh]C[DS: instead W gets to play the big point.];B[bg];W[ag]
;B[af];W[ah];B[bf];W[sb];B[ra];W[ch];B[sa];W[sc];B[gs];W[fs]
;B[hs];W[ho];B[lp]C[DS: M5 would yield 2 more points for B.]
;W[ln];B[mn];W[lo];B[kn];W[nn];B[na];W[ke]C[DS: B should have played L15 first to create a false eye at M16.  Another point lost.]
;B[tt]C[DS: B needs to fill in at J11 first.];W[ii];B[ig];W[db]
;B[eb];W[lr]C[DS: not a chance W!];B[tt]C[DS: B can play T1. W needs to play T2 for IGS scoring to work.]
