Not a good move here, you already have R14 which is low.];W[pl]

[ef:A]C[An alternative is jumping out at A.  That may invite a move at B by white.  Even with the jump, I felt the left side was still invadable.  That's why I chose to invade the corner.

Also, white's upper side framework is getting bigger.  But black has sente, so I think it's about even?


I think so.];B[ld]LB[mf:B][mq:A]TR[ok][pl][om]C[I spent a lot of time on this move.  A looks big at the bottom, but I was concerned a move at B by white would buid up the framework.  At this time the three marked white stones were light and it wasn't easy to attack them.  So I played the game move to reduce white's upper framework and built a wall at the same time in preparation of attacking white's 3 marked stones later.]

;B[fa];W[ga];B[ea];W[gb];B[qb]C[This move is worth about 15 points and with it I thought black would not lose the game.]
;W[qk];B[lh];W[ri];B[rh];W[rj];B[qh]LB[qg:A][ph:C][sh:B]C[Defending at A would make white's hane at B gote and saved black 2 points.  But the peep at C is problematic and I didn't want to take a chance to complicate the game.


If you not going to save the "2 points", this stone should at Q11, or P18 or B2 etc.]

C[Harleqin [3k\]: thanks

Harleqin [3k\]: yes
egame [4k\]: ok, got it.
Harleqin [3k\]: but it would only have mattered if there was another dame
egame [4k\]: what does that mean?
Harleqin [3k\]: if there are three dame
Harleqin [3k\]: then A captures ko, B fills dame, A fills ko, B fills dame, A fills dame
egame [4k\]: then the last dame is worth a point?
