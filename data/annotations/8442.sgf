(;W[do]C[*The low approach is also playable.
As most of the stones on the board are low, this becomes a territorial game. 
The high approach will be good if it is used in combination with the d15 stone.]
;B[fp];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[er]
(;W[cl]MA[do][de]C[Tami: Perhaps I should have played at C9 to get a better balance with d15.

*The stone at d15 aims at taking influence/territory on the left side, and the high approach move at d5 also looks at taking influence. Since these two stones have a similar purpose white should try to combine them. White could for example construct a moyo here instead of taking immediate territory. So a move like c8 or c9 which mainly takes territory is insufficient.

Low moves like c8 or c9 can be met with a shoulder hit which easily flattens the moyo, so they should be avoided in cases like this.

Whenever choosing a move in the opening, try to find the most efficient way to use your stones. Stones with similar meanings can often be used together.

If the d15 stone was on the star point then c9 would make good balance. But in this case, it's difficult for black to approach from the left side at c13 for example, therefore black will most likely approach from d17 which makes it very easy to construct a moyo here.

Compare this with the following variation:];B[dc]
(;W[fd]C[*Because of white's move at c8, it is too difficult for white to construct a moyo anymore. White should now focus on taking territory or fighting.]
;B[cd]C[Tami: Black's move looks too tight and small, and it's not even in Kogo.

*In this kind of territorial game, this is a good move. 

This move was played in a game between Go Seigen and Shinohara Masami - 1933-04-05. The following moves were:]
(;W[ce]
(;B[dk]C[Tami: Perhaps this was his plan with d17 - to make the corner very tight so as to be able to play hard on the left carefree.

*That seems to be the case. I would prefer to play out the rest at the top left first though as it ends in sente for black.]
;W[eb];B[dl]
(;W[cm];B[db];W[fo];B[ck];W[gp];B[gq];W[go];B[hq]
(;W[ch]TR[ce][de]MA[ck][dk][dl][qh]C[Tami: I was worried about C13, but it looks too close to my marked stones.

*Instead of c13 your opponent has the move at c12. A little too close to his own stones but it gives him some room for eyes.

Furthermore, this move gives you eye space and a little territory while preventing your opponent from taking it with his weak group. And also attacks the 3 stones. I can't see a better move than this one.

Your group in the bottom left is not completely alive yet, but as long as these 3 stones are weak, your group won't have any problems.

Remember that in the opening you played 2 high stones. Your opening emphasised outside strength. I said earlier that you can use this to create a moyo but since that was denied you should find another use for it. Now you can use your strength to attack as you are here.

Whever you attack you shouldn't have killing the group as your goal, you need to see if you can make any other gains. Ofcourse if you can see a clear way to kill a group then do that, but here black can run towards the centre.

In this case your goals should be to secure the top area as it's the biggest area left and to settle your bottom left group. Another idea is to split black's stones on the right side with a move at r12 for example. Since you are strong in the centre and black is weak, you should win any fights that occur here.

Now compare this position with a black stone at c12 instead of a white one.]
;B[dh];W[ci];B[di]
(;W[cg]C[*This move is too passive. White is strong so white needs to be agressive here.]
;B[bk]
(;W[gk]C[*Too passive. Black can still just jump out into the centre with g11, g12.
And it doesn't help the white group much either.
Jumping to g8 is enough. After black jumps into the centre with his group, white can take sente to play elsewhere.]
;B[gi];W[fj]TR[fm][gm]MA[gk]C[Tami: This seems like an overplay - I have to mind the potential cuts around the marked points.

*Yes the white group is too weak to attack with.
White should just play in another big area.
The white stone will probably be cut off from the rest of the group later on, but whtie can sacrifice it to run into the centre with the weak group or to make eyes. Adding more stones here is too slow.]
;B[gg]CR[oc][md][ke][if][ii][kj][mj][oj]C[Tami: I like Black's move - it's very ??  (3 Dimensional).

*Yes it's a good move, the centre is big now.]

C[Tami: I resigned without waiting for K16.

The most obvious mistakes were the overplay at F10 and two ill-judged cuts. Also, I should have killed the top left corner in exchange for receiving a slightly heavy group on the left.



*Actualy black doesn't need to play any moves here, the white group needs 2 more moves to live.

For the opening, look at the whole board and see what is important, territory or influence. Then look at your stones and see how you can combine them so that they work towards the same goal. 

For the fighting, try to spend more time identifying strong and weak stones. When you are strong, fight. When you are weak, don't.

My recommendations: study go problems and openings. Go problems should be based on life and death, tesuji and semeai. Avoid endgame study completely for now, it is not important for you at this point.

You can study openings by looking at professional games and trying to see how they use their stones in context of the whole board position. Don't spend too much time on joseki. Commented games are always better. 
Another option is a fuseki dictionary, or if you have access to strong players you may be able to get more reviews of your games.

And finaly, play go. Don't just study. Very important.

*This is a huge point.
Killing this is a difference of about 30 points (the points you gain + the points you stop black from getting in the corner) and also outward influence.

But your group in the bottom left is extremely weak. After black plays c6 white will be in alot of trouble. If this group dies, black gains alot more than 30 points. Even if it manages to live, black will be able to easily profit from chasing it. So deciding to play the game move was better.]
