C[Dear Reviewer,

this is a game I (black) played against a 3d recently. I think my opening was mostly solid, but I made a careless mistake and he was able to attack my stones. Afterwards I counted me ahead, but invaded too deeply and barely lived by luck. In the end, he missed a tsumego and died.

I'm very interested in your thought on my moves. Was my direction and my shape ok? Did I miss sharp moves that could have ended the game immediately? Please point out my mistakes.

I'm glad you're taking the time to have a look at this game and I say thank you very much.
Sebastian.

[EV\] Hi, this is your reviewer.  You played a good solid opening.  I have some comments concerning the direction of play in the early middle game and the fight in the lower left corner.  After capturing a large group there, the game should have been over, but you  missed several chances to preserve the win without complications.  In general, you seemed to be trying a bit too hard to find sharp moves.  This is a good attitude, much better than playing passively, so I dont want to criticize it too strongly, but sometimes solid simple moves are best.]

(;W[ec];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[hc];B[bh]C[[EV\] This move is good, but B could also tenuki, since B18 makes a base if W attacks around here.]
;W[ci]C[[EV\] W could also tenuki, treating D12-B12 as a forcing exchange, not requiring immediate followup.  W has several other possible moves here, and B is not likely to invest another move anytime soon, so W can wait to see how things develop elsewhere before fixing the shape here.]
;B[cn]C[Is this the right side to invade?

[EV\] The other side has more room, so I would prefer an approach from that direction.  The stone at O3 does reduce the value of an approach along the lower side, but here the B12-C11 stones make the left side even smaller.  B has little room to make a base here, and if settling this stone provokes W to play B11, the upper group will be hurt.  On the other hand, if B approaches from below (F3 or F4) and W develops along the left side, B can undercut any W territory by playing B11 himself.]

(;W[cl]C[[EV\] See variation for another idea for W.  This move does not work efficiently with the C11-B12 exchange above.  It would be perfect in a different game, if B had not played B12 and W exchanged C13 for B18.]

(;B[dl];W[dk];B[cp];W[cq];B[dq]C[[EV\] Complicated but certainly playable.  I am not sure what is best for either side after this.  The hane at B3 is an alternative way for B to settle here.]

(;W[co]C[[EV\] The proverb says to extend after a cross-cut, so I would consider some of those sequences first.  The game sequence turned out badly for W.]
;B[bp]
(;W[bq]C[Overplay?];B[bo];W[eq];B[dr];W[oe]C[[EV\] Looks like W realized than E2 fails to a ladder.  Unfortunately two moves around here do not make up for the corner loss.]
;B[ep];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[rd]C[Is this the right shape?

[EV\] Seems forced but good.  Note that even after W blocks here, the B stone at R12 has a lot of aji (see later variation).]
;W[re]
(;B[ip]C[[EV\] B is much stronger to the left than to the right, so I would move this stone to the right one or two places.]
;W[do]LB[kq:a][jp:b][mo:c][mp:d]C[[EV\] This ia a bad idea.  Even if W could escape here, there is no real aji in the corner, so W is only creating a weak group, which will naturally help B consolidate territory along the lower side.  Better to invade or reduce the side (moves like A through D) while it is still open.]
;B[en]C[Correct idea?

[EV\] Sure, W can do nothing here -- struggling only makes B stronger.]
;W[eo];B[fo];W[fp];B[dn];W[ep];B[er];W[go];B[fn];W[hp];B[io]
;W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[iq];B[gp];W[fq];B[hr]C[[EV\] Game over.  B should count the score to verify this, then play safely to consolidate the win.  B gave W too many unnecessary chances after this.]
;W[mq];B[mp]C[Would it be better to play Nobi at O4?

[EV\] Either move would be fine.  B can afford to let W live here, since that will naturally provide center thickness useful for keeping the W right side in check.]
;W[bm];B[jc]C[[EV\] This looks more complicated and no larger than answering the last W move or investing another move around M4 to remove all the aji there.]

[EV\] This is a good time to count the score again.  Please verify that B has enough lead to afford a smaller but completely safe reduction -- see variation.  The rest of the fighting in this game was unnecessary and pretty complicated to analyze, so comments end here.]
