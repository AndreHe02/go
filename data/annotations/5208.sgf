C[Lunnainn [6k?\]: hi
dulcis [5k\]: hi

This game turned out to be a whole-board fighting game.
I had a feeling that my opponent was about 2 stones stronger than me, but I was lucky to win the game-deciding fight.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc];B[oc];W[qn]
(;B[qj]C[would it have been better to play r10 at r4 because the single stone is weak? Or are there other possibilities?

Empiror: r10 was fine, r4 was expected by white, r10 worked against w's plan. R8 is another choice for same effect.]
;W[np]C[Empiror: interesting move by w. usually it's not good to be divided.]

(;B[nq]C[Empiror: bad move.];W[mq];B[nr]C[Empiror: terrible move by b. as a rule of thumb, when board is empty, don't go to the 2nd line like that.]
;W[mo];B[op];W[oo];B[qp];W[ro];B[rp]C[I did not like this result very much, and my extension from the shimari is not worth so much anymore.

Empiror: right. w gained too much too easily here.];W[mr]C[but I was quite happy white played here again and gave me sente.

Empiror: it is not the best move for now, but N2 is big.];B[fd]
;W[df];B[jd];W[pi]
(;B[pj];W[oi];B[oj];W[ni];B[rh]C[how should I handle the shoulder play? was my way ok? Is there a better way?

Empiror: answer the shoulder move in the direction opposite to where u want to direct ur spearhead to. Q10 if u want to point to S12 direction, R11 when u want to point to O9 direction.]

(;B[rg]C[Empiror: too passive, it's ur backyard, u punch and kick.]

;W[ff];B[dk];W[dj];B[ej];W[di]C[Empiror: bad move of w]
(;B[eg];W[ei];B[ef];W[ee];B[fe];W[cf]C[here the fight starts...]
;B[cg]C[should I better just have caught g14 in a geta? But I wanted to keep white separated and destroy the territory at the left side.

Empiror: yes, u r right. also because w got D15 weakness, there is no hurry to capture F14 which could turn out a useless stone.]
;W[ed];B[fc]C[again here, I thought w f17 would be just too good for w

Empiror: yes. and F17 is huge itself. E16 was not a good move for w.]

;B[hj];W[dn];B[kf];W[ji];B[fm]C[Empiror: F8 is the shape here. anytime w goes for F8, b got headache.]
;W[gl]C[Empiror: good and bad moves are just one step away.]
;B[fl];W[gk];B[gj];W[il];B[en];W[eo];B[jj]C[Empiror: E6 not good .. to make an eye like that is not worth it.]
;W[kj];B[jk];W[jl];B[kk];W[lj];B[nn]C[Empiror: it might not be the good timing for this now.]
;W[no];B[kl];W[ii];B[hk];W[hl];B[hn];W[jn];B[km];W[in];B[hp]
C[I thought about just connecting out with o8. but then w would get a very large territory at the bottom.
I could have tried to attack the o11 group then, but I thought w has too much space and will manage to be alive.
So I decided to make this all-or-nothing-move.

Empiror: b is not in danger at all.];W[fn];B[gm];W[em];B[fk]
C[Empiror: unnecessary move, b is already connected here and the three stones are just 6 points.]
;W[gn];B[ho]C[Empiror: this doesn't work for b  if b can't capture w's J8 group.]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[im];B[lp]C[I was not able to read out this fight, if I could manage to kill the k6 group. But I still have the option to play o8, and if my h4 group has to die I want to get something for it at least, by destroying some territory at the bottom.

Empiror: how nice it is if u have had gone for M4 instead of O6 so L5 can end the game:). it's just a wishful thinking though.]

;B[nh];W[ng];B[oh];W[ph];B[on]C[but I still have this move... what should w have done here? was it really that easy?

Lunnainn [6k?\]: exciting game
dulcis [5k\]: yeah
Lunnainn [5k\]: cu
dulcis [5k\]: cu

won on time in the end, but I think I was safely ahead anyway


Empiror: both sides need to improve on reading and get better understanding of some commonly-seen shapes. w had more chances during the game but made the biggest mistake.  and regarding what kind of game is worth reviewing. My advice to my students is only slow, serious and lost games are worth review by a much stronger player. And in Asia, it's also about modesty :)
