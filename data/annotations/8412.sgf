C[Hello. I am white in this game and I won, but at some points I had a feeling that I didn"t play well the game, in the opening I was very unsatisfied of my directions of play, and in the middle-game I am sure my invasion wasn't well thought and I got lucky my opponent let me live everywhere. I lose a group in the upper left corner but I think it's all up to me, I forgot about not being enclosed :) . Thanks for your explanations and answers ! Feel free to add some comments if at some points you have the feeling I did something not very good and didn"t realize it :) .

TM -- Hello, I'm the reviewer, MrMoto on KGS. You played a solid game, but should keep a few things in mind:

1. Protect your weak groups, and make eyes before it's too late. There were a few instances where you narrowly survived only because of an oversight by Black.

2. Playing strange moves (G17) is fun and good to experiment with, but at least follow through with them. You didn't seem to know what to do with your stone after playing it.

3. In fact, the whole development in the upper left bears looking at, starting from your strange move and ending in the death of the corner. See moves 38-69.

Advice for Black: don't be so submissive!];B[pd];W[ce];B[pp]
;W[dq]C[I play some 5-3 and 5-4 points to see how this can work :) but I still don"t completely see in which direction they aim.]
;B[pj];W[nc];B[jc]LB[lc:A][jd:B]C[TM -- An unusual choice. This move isn't consistent with the san-ren-sei opening. Black A is very common; B is possible.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[He blocks on the wrong size, and so did he in the lower right, but then I didn"t know how to have the game mine easyily.

TM -- This is the correct side to block on. Otherwise it would be difficult to use K17.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[og]C[TM -- Black could play O16 now.]
;W[qg]C[I think it's best to answer here ?

TM -- Yes, this is the right move.];B[nd]C[Here was my first big interrogation : where to play now ? I was thinking my D17 would be followed by G17, so O17's aji was reduced, and i wanted to approach the lower right corner, maybe it wasn"t the good idea. Maybe D10 or so was good to make disappear black's strength, but then a E16 or E17 would have been good for black, and i could't have pincered as I woud have liked ...]
;W[nq]TR[nd][og]C[I went here then.

TM -- Black is overconcentrated at the top: if he wanted to play O16, then he shouldn't have played P13. His slow play gives you sente, and I think you made the right choice. It is common to make two approaches (O17 and O3) against san-ren-sei. If you don't approach the lower right corner, then Black will be happy to take K4.]
;B[no]C[I don"t know the follow-up of that answer, so I went to san-san, peacefully.

TM -- A good instinct.];W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[TM -- The wrong direction. The point of O5 is to build a moyo.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[rn];B[qm]
C[Black seems a bit overconcentrated, and his influence is good but not perfect ... I had my second big interrogation here : should i play on the lower side to reduce black's wall, play on the right side to balance black's influence, shut the corner on E16, do something around G17 ?]
;W[iq]LB[io:A]C[I played here to threat O3 to move.

TM -- This looks good. Once again, Black's play is slow. You could also consider playing one space higher so that Black isn't tempted to cap at A.]
;B[cl]
(;W[cn]C[I thought this pincer was natural, but then ...

TM -- What about approaching from the other side? You already have three stones at the bottom, while C15 is isolated.]
;B[ci]C[I don't know how to play in the corner, D17 seemed good but had no extension if black played G17 ... So here I thought C6 was not so good.]
(;W[gc]C[I tried something weird ^^.

TM -- Hm! What about D17 instead?];B[ec]LB[ed:B][fd:A]C[TM -- Naturally, Black tries to separate your stones. To give meaning to G17, I would consider fighting back around A or B, for example. The position would get complicated, and you would surely have to sacrifice something along the way, but it would make more sense than just abandoning G17 right away.]
;W[cc]C[And i got enclosed on the corner after that sequence, maybe here G16 was cool.]
;B[ee]LB[eb:A]C[TM -- An awkward position for White, especially considering Black's influence from the other side of the board. Keep in mind, though, that you can connect, if necessary, by playing at A.]
;W[ge];B[eg]C[Here I wondered about C13 but then D12 makes black link and I didn"t want this, so I cut without thinking the elephant's eye ...]
;W[dh]C[TM -- This looks reasonable. You should be able to put a lot of pressure on Black's two stones as a result.]
;B[cf]
(;W[df];B[dg];W[de];B[ef];W[ch]C[And then I didn't want black to link all this but it was wrong ...]
;B[cg]TR[ch][dh]C[TM -- Your struggle with the corner stones has really hurt the marked stones. You seem to have wanted to fight everywhere without giving anything up, but in the end Black gets stronger. Instead, when playing a move like D12, you should be ready to play lightly and make an exchange.]
;W[di];B[cj];W[bh];B[be];W[bd];B[bf];W[dc];B[eb];W[dd]C[Here I thought i am alive, but E16 is a lot better ...]
;B[ed];W[bm];B[bb]C[And in fact I was dead ^^];W[cb]
(;B[ba];W[ca];B[bc]C[TM -- Count liberties here: your group has 3, and so does Black's inside group. That means that your next move must remove one of his ...]
(;W[ad];B[da];W[fi];B[ek];W[hi];B[ie]LB[hf:A]C[TM -- Black can afford to be more aggressive, I think, considering the walls on the left and right. He could cut at A instead, for example. Otherwise, White will eventually just join these stones (as in the game).]
;W[gl]C[TM -- Good.];B[em];W[eo];B[gn];W[io];B[en];W[fo];B[gm]
;W[hl];B[in];W[fl];B[el];W[jn];B[im];W[jo];B[ho]C[TM -- This kind of move should be avoided. It gives Black nothing at all and just strengthens White.]
;W[hp];B[il];W[ik];B[jk];W[ij]C[Black gives me lots of points in the lower side, but I have a weak group and I wanted to do something about the upper area, and then I invaded ...]
;B[kl];W[ke];B[ig]
(;W[gg]C[TM -- Is this bigger than breaking into Black's moyo?]
;B[jh]TR[ke]C[Now began my wonderings ... What can white do here ? Live, just reduce the moyo somehow ? I managed to live but I think black made lots of mistakes ...

TM -- You have helped Black close off his moyo. Now you will have to struggle to live in the moyo, and your group in the middle left is not yet safe either.]

;W[pg];B[oh];W[mk];B[kd]C[TM -- This is an endgame move. Black cannot afford to play like this when the invading group must be killed at all costs.]

;W[pk];B[qk];W[oj];B[qi];W[lk];B[jj];W[oi]C[TM -- You've done a very nice job of pushing Black around. He is being too submissive. Nevertheless, you should remain concerned about making eyespace.]

(;B[ck]C[... but black let me live, and then my two groups are alive and white wins.]

;W[he]C[This was a mistake, but black didn"t see ...

TM -- You should be much more concerned about your group in the centre right. As you saw in the game, it nearly died. Play something safe like M10, and come back for some endgame points at H15 later.]
;B[hc];W[rh];B[mh];W[mg];B[nf];W[mh];B[mj];W[ni];B[ol]TR[he]
[rh]C[Here black M9 was killing, maybe black thought I had some group in atari here.

TM -- Indeed. This is why you should save moves like at the marked stones for endgame, when you know that everything is safe.]
