C[I would to have the beginning of the game commented, because my opponent chose a very strange fuseki, and I'm sure I didn't made a good response.]
;B[kp];W[dd];B[id];W[pd]C[I didn't wanted black to take the right side

That's ok.];B[jg];W[pq];B[kj];W[qk]C[This move make a chinese fuseki but there is a black stone around K4 (an important point to make this kind of opening)

Also R9 don't take really the right side (black is too strong in the center)

So a shimari is probably better (R5 for example)];B[jm];W[eq]
C[this wasn't good, was it ?

Not bad but c4 or D4 probably better];B[cp];W[eo];B[dn];W[iq]

;B[eh];W[fh];B[ei];W[fm];B[el]C[I gave black a big moyo on the left side.

It's not so big (around 35 pt)
If you play R5 now for example, you are not late];W[ld];B[qf]

If black save the G18 group the game become bad for white];W[qp]

;B[oj];W[qj];B[oi];W[og];B[me];W[md]C[maybe O15 was better]
;B[mg];W[le];B[mf];W[je];B[ie];W[gc]C[I saw I had to defend there, before attacking black stones]

(;W[mk];B[nk];W[lk]C[You have to choose which group to attack: the right side one or the Northern one;
Your right group is not quite alive so you can secure it when attacking the black northern one.]
;B[ii];W[ij];B[ji];W[kl];B[jk];W[jl];B[ik];W[il];B[hj];W[hk]
;B[hl]C[and I lost all the stones in the center ...

Yes it was the cruciale moment of the game (a winning one for you here)

conclusion:
With a strange fuseki dont play the usual plans ;
keep your serenity, try to take points and be ready for an attack when you get an opportunity.]

(;W[ii]C[I should have connected calmly, and black would have had a hard time to defend is group. maybe it was already dead.]
