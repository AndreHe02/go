C[Jon7: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.

[DaveConley\]: When the game began I was unaware at first and rushed, making a 4-4 opening. Typically I start with a 3-4 if I'm not sure how aggressive the player is.

[eversonyoshi\]: I read that you mainly play with computers. This is good in the beginning, but try to play more with humans. The computer always plays in the same way, so you will not learn new techniques. If it is difficult for you to play in internet, try to see games from professionals go players... You can download it in Gobase or Go4Go. Or you also can see the games from GTL (they are good because they already have comments).

About openings, it depends on the way that you like to play, for me:
- 3-3 is "slow" but gives you secure territory.
- 4-4 is "fast", gives you influence, but not territory.
- 3-4 is a middle term between 3-3 and 4-4.

I will review your game, but have in your mind that Go is complex. I am 3k KGS and 10k IGS (yes, this is strange), so I can show you good moves for now, but they are not the perfect moves... ;D]
;B[pd]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I like Hoshi (4-4) because it is flexible. When I said that it is "fast", is because you spend one move to enclose the corner. 
White could invade and survive in the corner, but this is bad because it would survive small and the Black influence would spread in the whole board.
There are many fusekis that can be made with Hoshi, like Chinese Fuseki and the San-Ren-San.]
;W[cd]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Usually people play in the opposite corner to avoid the "Diagonal Fuseki" and the fights that usually come with it. I read that players that has confidence in their Go play this way... White seems to be this kind of person... ^_^]

(;B[qp]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Good, I am trying to learn this fuseki too. See the variant about other choices. I will not enter in details in the fuseki because it is very difficult and I think that it is early for you. Just keep the names in your mind because you will have to learn them in the future.]
;W[dp]C[[eversonyoshi\]: He called you "mime", but he was the one who started copying you... ^_^]

(;B[qg]C[[eversonyoshi\]: When you play a second stone to enclose the corner, this is called "Shimari". Usually, 4-4 doesn't have Shimari neither the 3-3.
  Your move is not bad, but it doesn't put pressure in White. See the variant for alternatives.]
;W[oq]LB[oq:P3][dp:D4][mq:N3][lq:M3][kq:L3][kp:L4][lp:M4][mp:N4]
C[DaveConley: definately

[eversonyoshi\]: See? P3 is a Kakari in the same side of D4. A good way to break this is to attack with a Pincer ("Hasami").
  You have many options like low hasamis (L3, M3 and N3) and high hasamis (L4, M4 and N4). But hasamis sometimes lead to complex sequences, I recommend you to see "Kogo's Joseki Dictionary" or the site "Sensei's Library" to learn more about Hasami (Pincer).]
;B[ec]C[[DaveConley\]: Here, I kind of copied his move to see what kind of response I would get and maybe get a little insight on how aggressive he was.

[eversonyoshi\]: This is a cool strategy. Trying to understand the other player is good too.]
;W[de];B[hc]C[Jon7: you a mime?<_>

[eversonyoshi\]: He copied you and you copied him... it is fair to me... ^_^]
;W[dc];B[qm]LB[ed:E16]C[[eversonyoshi\]: In the joseki, Black plays in E16 instead of R7. But seeing the whole board, you move seems better than E16 to me. =)]
;W[qq];B[cn]LB[op:P4][pp:Q4][rp:S4][cn:C6][ck:C9][cj:C10]TR[dc]
[cd][de]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I think that you should have played at Q4 or even P4, to avoid White S4...  
Maybe you played C6 to cancel the power of the marked stones in the upper left corner, this is a good plan. C9 and C10 do the same job too.]
;W[dn]LB[cl:C8]TR[dl][dk][ck][cj][dj]C[[eversonyoshi\]: You were talking about understant the other player... If he want to make territory in the left side, he would have played a Hasami in C8 or in the other marked points.
 But to me, he wants the lower side.]
(;B[co]LB[dm:D7]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Usually, Black continues in D7, see variant.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bq];B[cl]LB[cl:C8]TR[dp][dn]C[[DaveConley\]: I'm very curios about this move, since this next sequence of moves I really didn't favor.

[eversonyoshi\]: To me, you played C8 trying to fix the sequence, otherwise, White would make a beautiful wall with the marked stones.]
;W[ci]LB[bp:B4][dm:D7]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I would like to save B4 to put pressure in White later, but I think that D7 is better now because you group will "run" to the center (where it has more chance to survive) and will impede White to make a great wall (that would be annoying...).
  Well, I will make variants for you in the next move. =)]
(;B[bj]LB[dg:D13][dm:D7]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I prefere D7 to attack with D13 later. I will make two variants showing what I said in the last move.]
;W[bi];B[cj];W[dj]
(;B[dl]LB[dk:E9]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I think that E9 is a better shape, see variant.]
;W[aj];B[ak]LB[bk:B9][ak:A9]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Sometimes you have to defend in B9 instead of A9, like now.]
;W[bk];B[ai];W[ck];B[bl];W[aj];B[bj]C[[eversonyoshi\]: You deal well with the situation... =)]
;W[ah];B[aj];W[cj];B[al];W[bh]TR[ah][ci][dj]SQ[dl][cl][bl][al]
[ak][aj][bj][ai][cn][co][bp]C[[eversonyoshi\]: But now, White is strong in the upper left side. And your group has only one eye... I belive that a dan player can kill it. Usually, it is good to chase these kind of group and threathen to kill them because you earn something in the process (territory or influence).]
;B[dm]LB[fl:F8]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I prefer F8 because is easier to make life in the center.]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[ap]LB[an:A6][bm:B7]C[[eversonyoshi\]: See... A6 and B7 are "Miai". If you play in one of these points, White can play in the other and you will have just one eye... So you will have to make the second eye in the center. If White see this, he can take advantage. =(]
;B[do]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Good, now you have more options to survive...]
;W[en];B[eo];W[ep]
(;B[fp]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I think that this move is a little risky, I prefer F6, see variant...]

(;W[fo]C[[eversonyoshi\]: This leads to a double atari, if White wanted to kill, he should have more patience... See variant.]
;B[fn]C[[eversonyoshi\]: In Go, read some moves ahead is important. White needed to read just 2 moves ahead. Try to read 4 or 6 moves ahead during a fight, this will prevent you to make this kind of mistake (the double atari).]
;W[go]
(;B[fm]LB[fp:F4][gn:G6]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I think that you can play G6 to use F4 and gain some points, see variant.]
;W[fq]LB[fp:F4][gp:G4][fq:F3]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I prefer G4 instead of F3 to kill and contain F4...]
;B[he]LB[hc:H17][ec:E17][qj:R10][kc:L17]C[[eversonyoshi\]: You are trying to build a big moyo, inviting White to invade. This is a good idea. When White invade, it will be difficult to kill directly, but you can threaten the group and profit with it.
  I like L17 too. R10 is another good point, but it is more urgent to strenghten E17 and H17 to avoid White to attack and invade at the same time...]
;W[eb]LB[qj:R10][nc:O17]C[[eversonyoshi\]: White is helping you to strenghten your group... I prefer an attack at O17 or R10.]
;B[fc];W[ff];B[pj]LB[pj:Q10]TR[ec][fc][hc][he]C[[DaveConley\]: ?????

[eversonyoshi\]: What? It is a good move, now the marked Black stones are strong enough to fight back (if it were necessary). Q10 defends this part of the board and will help to attack any White attack in the upper right  corner... =)]
;W[qc]LB[nc:O17][nd:O16]C[[eversonyoshi\]: In beginning I said that White could invade in 3-3 and live, but Black would get a huge influence in the center. Now, the invasion is worst, since the Black influence can become territory because of the surrounded stones.
I would prefer O17 or even O16.];B[pc]C[[eversonyoshi\]: The right side since your moyo is huge. Now it is clear that the invasion helped you.]
;W[qd];B[qe]LB[pe:Q15]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Q15 is possible too to avoid "Aji". Aji is a japanese term that is used when you have some weak point that doesn't work now, but can work if the situation change a little.]
;W[re]
(;B[rf]LB[qb:R18][pe:Q15][qf:R14]C[[DaveConley\]: Maybe R 18 would have been better?

[eversonyoshi\]: I like R14 in this case to avoid the atari in Q15. Well, let's see your variant about R18... =)]
;W[pb]
(;B[rd]LB[ob:P18]C[[eversonyoshi\]: P18 is the move that you was looking for this situation. See variant.]
;W[pe];B[qf];W[od]C[[DaveConley\]: I'd really like to how I could ran the following sequence better.

[eversonyoshi\]: Yeah... It was painful because ruined your moyo a lot... =(]
;B[oe];W[oc];B[pf]LB[of:P14]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I prefer P14... But now, the whole upper right corner was ruined, White is leading now.]
;W[pd]LB[kc:L17][kp:L4]C[[eversonyoshi\]: This move is small... White can attack the other Black group with L17 or defend his moyo in the lower side with L4.]
;B[ne]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Right. You are building another big moyo.]
;W[nd];B[ld];W[md];B[me];W[lc];B[kd];W[kc];B[jc];W[jd]LB[jd:K16]
C[[DaveConley\]: And here is where the game frustrated me the most. I thought I played it well, and my opponent was just digging a whole for himself. But as you will see,by move 168, I lose the game.
   Was white sure he had me, or was he just to stubborn to let his group die, hoping that I would make a mistake?

[eversonyoshi\]: I agree that White helped you (Black) to build this huge wall, but the White group is surely alive. K16 is an annoying cut point, but you can deal with it... =)]
;B[je]LB[je:K15][id:J16]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Right, atari at J16 (instead of K15) could be dangerous since White could try to make a living group in the center.]
;W[id];B[ic]LB[ie:J15]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I confess that I would have played at J15 to avoid problems, but you played very well in this situation, congratulations! =D]
;W[ke];B[le];W[ie];B[if]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Nice.];W[jf];B[hd]
;W[je]
(;B[ig]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Almost. You reduced the White's liberties and now you could have catched it with a Net ("Geta"). See variant.]

(;W[lf]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Even so, I can't see a way for White to leave... ^_^ See variant.]
;B[jg];W[kf]LB[of:P14]C[[DaveConley\]: Maybe here is where I should attacked somewhere else. But I was just to concered for my 6 chain group with only 3 liberties. Was I wrong?

[eversonyoshi\]: You were right. Your 6 chain group will die only if White cut at P14. But when it happens, you give atari at O14 and escapes. Probabily, White wanted to kill it with a Net, but he was waiting for your mistake and it is not a good strategy. =P]
;B[mg]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Good, you catched him... =)];W[mf]

(;B[of]LB[ng:O13]C[[eversonyoshi\]: White is dead anyway, but you could have finished it with O13, see variant.]
;W[ng];B[lg];W[nf];B[mh]LB[mi:N11]TR[mg][lg]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Be careful with the "Empty Triangule" shape, try to avoid this. You could have played at N11, for example.]

;W[ki];B[mq]LB[jq:K3][ii:J11]TR[ni][mi][ki]C[[eversonyoshi\]: These White stones are weak, so you can chase them with J11. If you want to destroy the lower side K3 is good. You move is good too.]

;B[fj]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Good, the White center group is almost dead.]
;W[fi];B[gi];W[fk];B[fh]LB[gk:G9]C[[eversonyoshi\]: G9 is more safe. But if you want blood, you can play F12 too... ^_^]
;W[ei];B[ek]LB[gk:G9]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I still prefer G9 to avoid headache.]
;W[ej];B[gj];W[gh];B[gg];W[hh];B[fg];W[hg]
(;B[gf]LB[gf:G14][hf:H14]C[[DaveConley\]: It seemed to me I had two options here:
1- Sacrifice my 4 stone group and play at J12 or J11
2- Or play at G14 hoping white couldn't survive in the center and I could connect the 4 stone group.
--But now I'm curious about H14. It would have left my 3 stones with 3 liberties and his 3 stones with only 2. ??
-- Either way I underestimated whites determination to live and it comes back to haunt me shortly.

[eversonyoshi\]: I made a variant with H14, but because of the surrounded stone, you couldn't have time to kill the White group. For me, G14 is right.]

C[Jon7: bravo];B[sc];W[lj]C[[DaveConley\]: I love ko battles!! I can't resist. Any advice as to where I would research getting better in these situations?

[eversonyoshi\]: Good because Ko is important in Go. This ko worth only one point. But there are Kos that can value the game. Before entering in a Ko battle, you have to count how many Ko threats each one has and the value of all the threats.
  This analyse is difficult and it takes time. If you want to get better in Ko battles, try to improve your read skills. A good way is solving "Tsumegos" (Go Problems). And the best place to do this, in my opinion, is in the site of Go Problems... ^_^]

(;B[qa]TR[sa][ra][rb][na][ma][mb]C[[eversonyoshi\]: These shapes give you two Ko threats, and worth six points. See variant.]
;W[qb];B[li];W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[lj]LB[jp:K4][ns:O1]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Since you have more Ko threats, you could have played in O1. And a evil threat was K4... ^_^]
;W[tt];B[ns]C[[DaveConley\]: Should have just passed huh?

[eversonyoshi\]: White should have captured O1, but he doesn't want, maybe...]
;W[tt]C[[DaveConley\]: Overall, I thought I played a decent game. I just wish I had done better in the center.
Any suggestions on where I need to improve the most, or any material that you think I need to read would be much appreciated. Thanks, Dave.

[eversonyoshi\]: Yes, it was a good game.

You should pay more attention (like move 205).

Train more about Nets (Geta) (moves: 99 and 151).

If you pay more attention and try to read just 4 moves ahead, you will notice a great improve in your game.

To improve your read skills, I recommend you to solve go problems (Tsumegos), mainly at computer, because in computer you can solve many problems in few time.

Try to learn "Tesujis" too, they are funny and useful.

After this, when you become 10k IGS or 5k KGS. You will feel a necessity to learn Fuseki and Joseki. This is where I am... ^_^

Thank you and enjoy in your next Go games! =D];B[tt]C[You can check your score with the score command, type 'done' when finished.

  When you attack a corner stone, this is called "Kakari". The best way to do a Kakari is playing in the same side of you corner stone, like E16 (same side of Q16) and F3 (same side of R4). This way your stones will work together and help each other.]
