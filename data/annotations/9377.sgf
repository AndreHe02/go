C[   Hello,
 I'm Tilwen, Black in this game ,that I played on KGS, reasonnable amount of time for it. My opponent had to leave at the end - at least, I think so, and I looked and was a bit behind, even without komi.
 I put some questions in the file, let me know anything that could help me understand what I got right, what I got wrong, thank you !

MR: I put comments in the file always starting wit "MR:".
You started well of in the game with a lot of black territory and no clear perspectives for white to get appropriate territory himself.
Two times you started fighting and came off much better than necessary, in the upper left and when invading on the upper side. 
However, it seems that you get afraid on your opponents opportunities *after* you started the fights. 
My advice would be to try to imagine *before* starting a fight where there could develop own weak groups and/or opponents moyos.
In similar spirit, it is not a good idea to play within your opponent's territory because *there must be some aji* if you are not behind and if this costs points (e.g. loses endgame sequences). Some specific comments can be found at the moves in question.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[ep]C[I feel a bit uncomfortable with this opening, an enclosure wouldn't be so effective, then I decided to take the extension first, aiming at "weakening" white's influence.

MR: There are several possibilities, they more or less all depend on style. They include building a shimari in the lower right corner yourself, entering your opponents lower left corner with C4, playing somewhere in the middle of the left side, extending at the lower edge etc.]
;B[jq]C[Is this spot OK ? Is there a better point ?];W[nc];B[pf]
;W[jd];B[qk]C[White let me make a nice framework ...

MR: ... but you allow white to make a nice framework himself as well ...]
;W[oo]C[I don't know what possibilities there are after this kind of approach, I guess I can't connect the three stones, but as Q16-Q14-R9 can work "independantly", I thought making territory on the bottom was OK.

MR: White plays very cautious ... this move aims at reducing the black framework, while it does not make any base for white.]
;B[np]C[Would be R5 (for instance) more appropriate, what could happen next ?]
;W[pl];B[pk]C[Q14 R9 was a bit overextended, so this is nice for me right ?

MR: Right, this is good for black.];W[ol];B[cf];W[di]C[I'm used to the one space low pincer (C14), I wasn't so sure about what next here.

MR: "I am used to ..." is a strange way of arguing ... maybe you should start reading some yoseki dictionary ;-) 
One standard variation is given here.]
(;B[fc];W[df];B[cc];W[ce];B[dc];W[hc]C[This move surprised me, C13 then is nice right ? But should I defend somehow now ? Maybe go to the center ?

MR: H17 defends the upper side white group and has the potential continuation E18 later. Of course, not answering at the left side leaves a lot of aji in C14. However, in my opinion there is not "the one way" of exploiting this aji.]
;B[nj];W[mn];B[lp]C[I take points, white is still not so secure and my influence can reduce white's ...]
;W[pp];B[qp]C[just R3 maybe ?];W[qo];B[op];W[po]
(;B[rq]C[MR: I wouldn't want to give the free forcing move S4 to white.]
;W[rp];B[qq]C[I thought : if white connects, I have sente, if he doesn't he is still not alive locally.]
;W[hq]C[MR: Not the most important move as black is strong in the lower right corner.]
;B[cp]C[This seem an important area to play, what about this approach and the joseki that we played ? How could have I reduced white framework in the "best" way ?

MR: Right, to play in this area is most important now ... white should have done this instead of H3.]
;W[dn];B[eq];W[fq];B[dq];W[bo];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp]C[MR: The result is ok for black.]
;W[qc]C[I guess this helps to defend the M17 invasion, was I right to take points, or cut white was more important ?

MR: It is fine to take the points.];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb]
;B[rc];W[qb]C[MR: I would want to set whites lower rigth group in action with S7.]

(;B[cg];W[bd]C[White keeps me separated, then I have two weak groups to care about ...

MR: If you play C13, you must be ready to deal with white seperating your groups!]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[dh];W[bi]
(;B[ei];W[ch];B[dj];W[ci];B[dg];W[ef];B[fh];W[gf];B[bc]C[MR: Black is quite lucky to get good shape in the middle *and* to be the first to come back to the corner at B17!]
;W[eb]C[White sill has weaknesses, is this an overplay ? Was my answer OK ?

MR: As black has more territory than white, white has to try to exploit black's weaknesses. E18 is the correct point locally.]
;B[cd]C[MR: Looks like "brute force"];W[be];B[ed];W[de]C[MR: White could also consider to play the ko instead.]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[fb];W[gb];B[ga];W[ha];B[fa]C[I thought there would be something around J18 for later.

MR: Yes, some aji left ... but it is good strategy for white to first atteck the black group.]

C[... maybe it is, but white probably didn't play the right move. What do you think of the sequence here ?]
;W[fj]C[MR: It only makes sense to play this move if you can cut apart the black group ...]
;B[gi]
(;W[fk]C[MR: One does not want to play like this. Unfortunately, cutting at F11 does not work ...]
;B[fi];W[fm];B[kl]C[I aim at the cut at J12 ...

MR: Black escaped. Cutting at J12 is off-topic. The three white centre stones are totally unimportant now!]
;W[mk]
(;B[ih]C[MR: I would simply start to play large moves like N15.]

Your goal here is to connect the black groups!];W[ko];B[lk]
C[MR: ?
I do not understand your plan.];W[lj];B[ll];W[kj]
(;B[lo]C[MR: Inconsistent.];W[nk];B[oj];W[mj];B[ln];W[oh]C[This was a truth moment ... If I defend my side, white gets a nice moyo, and I thought giving up the P10 area was a etter way for me. Can I simply defend and have a good game ?

MR: I do not see why you should give up your stones. If you are afraid of moyo, become active earlier, there was enough time to play N15 or similar moves earlier!]
;B[ph];W[pi]
(;B[og]C[I didn't want white to get too big a moyo, maybe R12 was good enough here ?

MR: Yes, R12 is normal, this is definitely "strange".];W[qh]

;B[lc]C[Overplay ? I was kind of stressed by the fact my points were a bit gone ...

MR: Looks like overplay to me.]

C[This is probably a white mistake, N1 seems bigger and sente. My opponent left here, I tried to end the game and I saw I would lose by komi+. Do you see a way for black to win here ? Thanks for any advices, especially about things I thought wrong or I didn't even wonder !

MR: Most likely white will win the game. N1 and S5 seem to be some of the bigger points left. On the micro level, one of the reasons you lost is because of exchanges like S9 for W T10, which are a clear minus for black.]
