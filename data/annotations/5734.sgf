C[Hi, My name is Thomas, i'm the reviewer. I tried to answer your questions, and some questions you didn't ask too. I'm not a good player, so you shouldn't believe everything i say. 
Here are some advices to improve your game;
 - Try to link your groups together, especially when they're weak.
 - Evaluate the state of your groups. Are they weak, strong, alive, dead? Try to see if your stones play a big part in the game ( like your cutting stones), or if you can sacrify them.
 - Evaluate the importance, and value of each of your moves. Do not play somewhere else during a fight, but as the saying goes "Urgent points before big points "
 - Don't answer each one and every move of your opponent. Take the initiative.]

(;B[eq]C[White made a weird move by not taking the last corner, why not take advantage of it?
You could take the corner, and the advantage would be yours, with 3 corners to 1, eventhough he made a corner enclosure.
It seems to me, that with your C4 stone, and white's enclosure, one way to play is to "face" white's corner, and not keep your side too low (with C16 for example)]
;W[dd];B[cj]C[good];W[df];B[ej];W[jd]
(;B[jq]C[I think the biggest point on the goban now, is white's next move that is around Q10.
Because it would go well with your Q4 stone, and if white gets to play it would be right in front of his corner enclosure]

You're behind in territory, white's much more optimistic than you about the issue of the game, you have to do something to turn it around! reduce his territory, take risks!
