(;W[mp]C[This move is out dated and not as effective if black knows the counter which is  a strange one but the move is o4.]

(;W[go]C[Smill: Is this move necessary or it is better to play one big move on the top?
To answer your question this move is wrong. It is over concentrated with black playing d2.]

(;B[de];W[cg]C[He should punish you here by playing on top of you.]

(;B[fe]C[Lucky he played poorly.]
(;W[ce]C[again bigger picture not local gains.];B[dd];W[cd]
;B[ec];W[db]C[Now he will be very happy, but probably lacked skills to use this influence.]

(;B[eb]
(;W[kc]C[The reason you had to play into his shape is because you realize you are behind here so you needed to jump into his shape. He should punish.]

(;B[oc];W[nd];B[pf]
(;W[fg]C[Smill: Here I started to close moyo from top but probably it is better to do it around O7?
Hmmm this is an easily cut connection. When building a moyo you should think build great wall of china, so no raiders can attack later.]

(;B[mn];W[km]C[Well this is good idea, but lets be real its easy to hit this with a hammer.  I left some varations showing some of your weak points.]
