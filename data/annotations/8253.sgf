C[pmurk: Hallo, I am pmurk around 15k on KGS, 17k on Dgs and 13k on OGS. This is my first review, I hope you wil benefit from it. 
I feel not competent enough on giving comments on your overall playing style, but I think you are on a good path. Following "learn one thing from every game I tried to point out to black and white where I would play differently and tried to reason why I would play different.]
;B[gc];W[gg];B[cc]C[I play the top two star points.];W[cf]
(;B[ge]C[On the 9x9 board the center has even more influence and is more important than the side.]
;W[ee];B[eg]C[I want to invade the bottom.

pmurk: In my opinion to deep and risky. W responds with a rather friendly defense and leaves a possibility for you to connect back and make the invasion a success. Following the proverb "play in the middle of a symtric position" Wf4 is more difficult to deal with (see variation for a possibility). 
The way you played it is more a reduction than an invasion.]
(;W[dg]
(;B[fg]C[pmurk: B f4 would make a direct connetion and press against the lower right corner.]
(;W[ef];B[ff];W[gf];B[fe]C[I connect my stones.];W[he];B[hd]
;W[ie]
(;B[id]C[I stop her from coming up the side.
pmurk: With w18 h4 she can and has build a solid shape. B17 g2 hurts her, I think (see my variations)]
;W[hf];B[ed]C[I hit her two stones on the head.  I want to attack them and stop him from coming into my territory.]
;W[de];B[gh]C[I attack her group on the side.

pmurk; Correct to push the group to reduce territory locally. But C6 or D6 seem to bring more point globally.]
;W[hh];B[fh];W[hi];B[gi]C[White has enough territory to live.

pmurk: Correct, but you can hope for a mistake with J3. I often discuss with oponents if this is good style but on my level I feel that, especially under time pressure when playing online one has to proof that one can defend and it is worth trying.]
;W[cd]
(;B[bd];W[dd]
(;B[fd]SQ[dc]C[I want to protect the f6 stone.

pmurk: no need to protect f6 here, see variations. D7 marked is more important as you connect the NW.]
(;W[bc]C[pmurk: With w30 D7 she would hurt you badly.];B[dc]
;W[be];B[bb]C[I really want to move around this corner but I am going to lose a stone.]
;W[ad];B[cb];W[dh];B[eh];W[bh]C[At this point I start counting territory and know I will lose if I can't break in anywhere.

pmurk: Your next move Bd1 is gote as w can react and you have to react, so you loose sente. Compare the variations, the all lead to a win for black. 
The reason is B a8 has more than 1 point as you "save the corner".]
