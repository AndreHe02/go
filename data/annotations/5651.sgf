C[ok, so this is my game on igs. im 22k on there, and have no idea how to advance throught the ranks. my record is 32 wins 37 losses, over half being players over 10k. my oponent is PENGUIN, another 22k. i wouldnt have sent in this game if it hadnt spiked my interest as i personally looked over it after teh game was over. anyways, i look forward to your comments.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[qq];W[dc];B[pj]C[variation of the chinese opening.

vlkplk: This doesn`t seem as chinese openning. There is the small chinese opening, but it is not the case either...]
;W[oc]C[did i attack the right side?

vlkplk: It`s hard to say, which side is `right` to atack. I think that attack on both sides is possible. Maybe upper side might be slightly better, for if black play  counter move like N17 or M17, his later development along upper side would`nt be so valuable, since there is already white stone at D17 on the way.

There is not enough space to discuss josekis here and it`s off the reach of my ability as well. I`m adding some variations so as you can see what might have happened. But for the beginnig it would be enough to keep on mind - if you play stone on 3rd line, you secures territory, if on the 4th line, you goes to get strength toward the center. Keep this in mind and be consistent with chosen strategy and you will be surprised, how well it works.]

(;B[pc];W[od];B[pf];W[ld]C[vlkplk: Nice exchange from both players. Black gets better off, tough, because he is one move ahead in this corner.]
;B[jc]
(;W[id]C[vlkplk: It is good idea from white to keep black off the center and force him against white`s D17 stone.]
;B[jd]C[vlkplk: Natural move from black. Even if he can`t escape into the center, he must try to create some cutting points which would be helpful for living on upper side.]

(;W[kc]C[is this the right direction?

vlkplk: Even if it went not so bad for white later, this move is quite inconsistent with white`s previos move. Imagine, for example, reverse order of moves-after the sequence bK17-wL17-bK16, would you play J16 next?]
;B[ic];W[hd];B[hc];W[gd];B[fc]
(;W[de];B[ed];W[dd]C[vlkplk: This connection is very safe move, but white must keep on mind that his prospective territory on left side is still open for attack. Ofcourse, not just now, but later,  if white doesn`t play there.]
;B[fd]C[vlkplk: Whites four-stone group P17 has weak points and might be attacked later. On the other hand, black`s K17 group can easily escape to the center or survive by attacking white P17 group or by catching white`s 3 stones.

One thing I liked during this game is white`s ability to sacrifice or abandon his stones when they become useles, for the time being. Many weak players and even stronger ones cannot do this.]

(;W[qo]C[vlkplk: I would first secure white`s P17 group. After this, invasion at Q12 or R12 is possible.]
;B[pp]
(;W[po]
(;B[op]C[lets say black played elsewhere. are q4 and r3 weak enough to attack?

vlkplk: Ofcourse you can attack them, but 1)there is enough open space to escape or making life in the corner for them, 2)stones at R5 can be easily attacked by black.

Problem is in what you mean by attack. In actual game white is PUSHING them along the side, so they become strong and safe. By ATTACK is usualy meant some move, which threatens the life of attacked group or stones.  Now, on the contrary, white`s two stones at R5 could be attacked by move like Q7.

Perhaps, it would be good to mension here one of basic strategic  rules, which is easy to say, but hard to keep: `The main purpose of attacking is not to capture the oponent`s stones, but to make territory and/or secure ones own weak stones.`]
;W[oo];B[np]
(;W[ql]C[should i have kept going to O5?

vlkplk: No. Even P5 was not good, I think. Black is happy for being pushed along fourth line, where he can get territory. At the same time, influence/strength of white wall is nulified by Q10 and safe black stones in upper right corner.]

(;B[pl]C[vlkplk: Seems to be better than black`s R9, for after the exchange of R9-Q8, white is safe.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[pm];B[om];W[pn];B[nl];W[mn]C[bad move?

vlkplk: Not bad, it`s good to keep black separated. But because this stone can be cutted as well, it`s value is lessened. And it is, so to say, not a multi-purpose move.]
;B[no];W[nn];B[on]C[vlkplk: The question is now, what white will do with his two cutting stones. One possibility is to leave them and wait with decission for later. Or to make some light jump like L6, or threaten black`s territory on lower side with M5.]

;W[mg];B[og];W[mi];B[ml]
(;W[ke]C[this move. it seemed neccesary for an invasion toward the middle. i thought about defending my p17, yet it felt a bit too passive, giving black the sente he needs to take the center. where is the most effective move that you can think of?

vlkplk: This is good idea, as L15 prevents black`s N15 and at the same time threatens connection with white three stones. Maybe w L14 would be good as well.

But anyway, white`s stones here are already strong and cannot be cutted. I would play M5 or somwhere on lower side.]
;B[je];W[jf];B[ie]
(;W[ge]C[i dont suppose this is already dead?

(;W[fg]C[felt a bit far out to be a good move. it also gives white sente. i wanted to constrict black from making an entire break for the center, but it should have been executed better. your thoughts?

vlkplk: It`s good move, as it makes possible G14 group escaping. But it leaves cutting point at D14, which black can explore for invasion on  the left side. later.]

(;W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[cq]
(;W[bm]TR[ci][cj]C[a prediction on a ladder on these two stones. is this blatantly obvious or a bad move?

vlkplk: It`s good that you can see such moves, it can be useful for life and death situations. But reason for avoiding it now is simple that black cannot be killed, so it helps black to fix his weak point at C9. After that he can play as in variation, which would not be possible without wB7. Right approach on black`s left group is from outside.]

(;B[rh];W[ni]C[this was a fairly awekward move for me to make. i think it could be better but im not sure.

vlkplk: Since in the endgame sente is important (as is, ofcourse, during all the game, but in endgame it`s more easy to count value of moves), there is nothing wrong with playing solid moves, sometimes.]

C[vlkplk: As for ko threats, you should not play moves like wS13. The reason is that white could play T12 and get some points in sente. By playing S13 as a ko threat, option of playing T12 is lost. And value of this ko is, I`m not sure though, 2.5points+gote, while value of wT12 would be 2~3points, but sente.

Best ko threats are moves like wC8. Anyway, for both would be better not to play this ko now.]

vlkplk: Yes, it was quiet game with no big mistakes. Which I liked most from white is his ability to sacrifice stones, which are of not much of use already. As for endgame, black was playing better (he got about 10~15points, I think), but because of loss in center, it was not enough.]

;W[gd];B[gc];W[fd];B[fc];W[ed]C[vlkplk: Now black must  try hard and invade left side before it becomes white territory. White on the other hand should use his strong wall to make black`s life hard there and to gain territory during the fight.

Or black can develop safely his territory on right side, while white would do the same on left side.

It is just matter of taste.]

(;B[od]C[vlkplk: One of other possible answers for black. Means that black is going to build a moyo (territory, which is not yet secured, but IF it becomes territory it would be huge) along the right side.

I`m not going to discuss josekis, because I don`t know them. For beginners, as we both are, is enough just to try to think, what might happen if... To REMEMBER josekis is quite hard. Better than REMEMBER is to UNDERSTAND. My opinion.]
