C[Additional Comment: Andre Bergholz, (2K) in Germany, berge on IGS, NNGS (Comments marked with AB)]
;B[dd]C[Hello, and thank you for condescending to review this game.
I have one question written at move 33. The remainder of the game
is low kyu flailing about without effectiveness.
This type of 'helping the opponent build power' plagues my recent playing. This was a speedy game but I have difficulty in thinking
slowly. Please excuse, and Thank you.

>> Playing slowly is a good way to be able to play fast games ... You really should try to play some longer time control games]
;W[pd];B[dq];W[pp];B[jd]LB[nq:A][nc:B]C[Why not at C9 or D9 (chinese fuseki) ?

AB: A bit unusual, though nothing to worry about for you. Personally, I would prefer a kakari at either o3 (first choice) or o17.]
;W[do]
(;B[cp]LB[dk:A][cm:B][fp:C][co:D]C[This move doesn't appear in any of the joseki  books i've been able to open ...

gives the feeling you're sealing yourself in the corner
better to try a pincer , or F4

AB: I don't like this move, though, again, this maybe a losing move for professionals, but not for us. A pincer would work well with your upper stones ('A' or 'B'), but the simple joseki starting with 'C' is also an option (see variation). The other well-known joseki starting with 'D' seems less suitable, because it gives White a too good position in front of your stones on the upper side. A pincer is definitely the best.]
;W[co];B[fp];W[ck];B[cg]LB[nq:A]C[AB: Definitely big. So is 'A'.]
;W[lc];B[dc]LB[nq:A][qj:B]C[way too passive

i'd make an approach move against the lower right corner

AB: I agree here. 'A' and 'B' are my top choices.];W[hd];B[nc]
LB[ke:A][jb:B]C[AB: Not good, this is more like a losing move at our level of playing. The one and only reason is that you don't separate White's stones, but your own stones will be separated. 'A' and 'B' are better alternatives.]
;W[md]LB[jc:A][ie:B]C[black helped white separate the two stones (K16 and O17)  this cant be good for B

AB: I don't like the White move here either. He should simply connect his stones with 'A'. Then, Black's K16 stone is completely wasted. White gives Black the opportunity to make a trade and go for the other stones with 'B'.]

(;B[od];W[oe];B[pc];W[nd];B[oc];W[qd];B[qc];W[rd];B[rc]TR[nc]
C[black once again sealed himself in the corner

AB: Yes, Black put himself in an uncomfortable situation, and playing and unflexibly defending the marked stone is the reason.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[de];B[ce];W[fe]
(;B[pf]LB[ne:A][pe:B]C[This move only reinforces white

points i'd consider now are (in decreasing order)

-) play in the middle of the right side
-) K14 to keep the center from becoming white
-) approach move against Q4 (from the right side)

AB: This is also a really bad one. White's position was not solid, there are cutting points at 'A' and 'B' to be explored. Now you invite White to defend himself, and belive me, he is happy... (see also variation).]
;W[pe];B[pi]LB[qk:A][qh:B][qn:C]C[The last two B moves we're all about my brain telling me that I must
erase whites
power immediately. Supposing that you had a headache and played the B
fuseki
as such to 29. What could black do at 31 and the next few moves to swing
the balance of power?

>> When I have a very bad headache, i never play go :))
>> Comment for move 31 is still valid .. I'd have played a move such as Q10 to try to counterbalance the white wall

AB: Actually, I prefer R9 ('A'), without the terrible move 31, of course. You will be able to make a reasonable position with either 'B' or 'C', and on the third line living is easier.]
;W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[ni]TR[pf]LB[qf:A]C[black still has defects at his base ...

as will W38 show next

AB: Well, Black doesn't really have a base, because the marked stone doesn't contribute much. If Black had an additional stone at 'A' things would be different.]
;W[qh];B[pn]C[AB: Black is in continous trouble, bad signs if you want to win. This move will make things even more complicated, but that may be your only option...]
;W[rj];B[qq]TR[ni][pi][qj][pf]LB[nq:A]C[good (in my view)

the Q11 group will be in trouble anyway now .. so you have to seek compensations elsewhere

AB: Yes, the marked stones should be treated lightly, prepare to lose some of them. I'm not sure about your move though. I'd still prefer a kakari from the other side ('A').]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo]C[B should **cut** here, without asking any question
Let's see how W chooses to answer and start thinking at that time
Things can't go on well for W if B plays 45 at Q5]
(;B[pr]C[AB: I agree that cutting is your only option. You must understand that every stone has a certain inherent fighting value, and that they can be combined by forming units. You naturally want to prevent the opponent from forming a strong unit in an unsettled area if you can.]

(;W[or]LB[po:A]C[AB: Even though White gets a good result in the end anyway, I would prefer just to connect at 'A' (also for educational purposes, see variation :-)).]
;B[ro]TR[pn]C[why such a submissive play ?

AB: Still cutting seems better, though the Black move here is not so bad, because it still somehow works together with the marked stone.]
;W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[qr];W[nq]C[white has gained the wall in the lower right against the one he had in the upper

but B has lots of weak stones on the board ..];B[ph]LB[jq:A]
[hq:B]C[AB: 'A' seems to be the most important point. It is a good extension from Black's corner and reduces White's thickness. Just imagine a White stone at 'B' instead...]
;W[ng];B[iq]TR[hd][fe][de][df]LB[lq:A][li:B]C[wasn't to late to try to take K16 out and annihilate white's plan to take the center

white would be left with nearly no points on the board

AB: The problem with the K16 stone is that you can't use it to attack the marked White stones. So treating it lightly is okay. The Black move here is good and should be followed up by 'A' if possible. 'B' is also important.]
;W[kq];B[gc]LB[li:A][ek:B]TR[pf][ph][pi][qj][ni]C[if white answers this, black has gained a very few points on the upper side,   while white gets much stronger

AB: A play in an unimportant area, though problably sente. I still would go for 'A' though 'B' is interesting, too. It attack the White stones and provides help for the marked Black stones.]
;W[hc]C[done];B[dm];W[cm]
(;B[cn]LB[dk:A]C[dubious move i think

AB: Yes, 'A' would be better (see variation).];W[dn];B[cl]C[??
what's the point of this ?];W[bn];B[bm];W[dl];B[cn];W[em]C[black collapses

AB: That was really bad... Don't start to study fuseki, before you avoid this kind of thing :-).]
;B[gd]C[playing yose here only gives white a good opportunity to get stronger

taking K16 may still be possible];W[ge];B[hb];W[ib];B[gb];W[jc]
;B[he]C[too late  white is now strong here

AB: I agree. Maybe there will be an opportunity later, but not now.]
;W[gg]C[AB: In fact, Black only helped White to occupy this nice point.]

(;B[id]C[AB: This is bad for two reasons. First, there is really nothing to be done there, so you should just leave it. Second, it's bad technique (see variation for better technique).]
;W[ic];B[jg]TR[he][id][jd]LB[li:A]C[I believe that this stone should have been at k12 instead. I was going
to use the
aji of the three stones to erase power and pull the q11 group to safety
but
my plan backfired.

>> This looks like a stone that will really have to take K16 and sisters out ... If you wish to use these three stones as a 'threat', you have to play at k12, l12 or m12 (maybe even on the 11th line)

AB: You don't want to save the three stones at all. J16 and K16 are compltely useless, they can easily be sacrificed. H15 cuts two groups, but one of them is alive and the other one is stronger than any of the Black center stones, so Black should only activate H15 once his own groups are settled. Simply play 'A' instead.]
;W[hf]LB[hi:A]C[AB: White is being nice here, a move around 'A' would be more effective and seriously theaten all of Black's center stones.]
;B[li]TR[hf][gg][ck][dl][em][kq][nq][ng][pk][qk]C[B79 and 81 are not connected
thus the idea of playing B79 lower

AB: Black has worsened his own situation and nowhere to run to. Some stones will be lost, there is no reason to connect to 79, which was a bad one after all.]
;W[kh];B[nl]TR[pf][ph][pi][qj][ni][li][nl]C[doesn't connect with Q6 either
so this is a wasted move, as black's only hopes rely in the connection with the lower left

why not m8 ?

AB: Again, don't bother with the singular Q6 stone that can easily be sacrificed. There is no reason to save it, Black should concentrate on saving the marked group and go on from there. The Black move was actually good, because it also reduces some of White's thickness.]
;W[oj];B[oi]LB[nh:A]C[AB: Bad shape! Try 'A' instead.];W[mk]

(;B[nj]C[once again
forces white to connect, thus loses possibilities for black

AB: Yes, you must cut (see variation).];W[nk];B[ki];W[jh];B[mg]
LB[ji:A][ih:B][jk:C]C[what's the point of this stone ?

black can't make an eye with it

if you wish to play yose from this group before it is alive, you are taking lots of risks :

-) playing yose makes you lose liberties
-) you're also losing some opportunities that may occur later

as a yose move, M12 would be better, since it wouln't end up captured ...

AB: Well, the move is not that bad. It's sente and exploits some possibilities of rescuing the group. But a simple sequence Black 'A', White 'B', Black 'C' would be better.]

;B[kj];W[kk];B[jm];W[km];B[jl]LB[lk:A]C[black made his road to the lower left , but gave white :

the territory around O8 with the prisonners
the H13 territory with some prisonners

and made no point out of it

The cause for this was the weakness of the Q11 group, itself created by B31 at Q14 which was too near from white's power

AB: Retake the ko at 'A' first, you can connect at 115 later. Yes, you should have done something for the group earlier and treated it more flexible,, but that's very difficult.]

;B[gi];W[dh];B[dg];W[eh];B[eg];W[fh];B[ch];W[ci];B[fg];W[gh]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[eb];W[af]C[AB: Well, White had all the center influence in this game. Your weak stones had no escape route, so defending them was difficult. Try to play more flexible in difficult situations! Sacrifice some of your stones to save the important ones. Cut if it is necessary. Cutting can be a good technique for defending important stones and sacrificing unimportant ones. Adn, of course, avoid desasters like the one around C7.
