C[Ilya: Dear reviewer, I played this game as black. Despite winning the game by resign after capturing a big white group this game is still rather interesting for me to get this game reviewed as there was many unclear points in the opening.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[qp];B[cn];W[de];B[ci]TR[cg][cn][dh][di]
LB[cj:A]C[Ilya: In the game I played this move thinking that it would work in two directions at the same time. Is it doubtful move? In a db search I didn't find pros to play this way. One explanaition I considered is that this pincer doesn't seem to restrict white stone much and the gap between two marked stones too wide.

PC: Your move here works as both an extension from your C6 stone and a pincer against the White stone, so it can't be a bad move. A move closer to C6 would be a stronger extension but it wouldn't be a pincer, so I prefer your move to something like 'a' (C10). As far as I know the three space low pincer isn't a joseki, so one of the pincers marked with triangles might be slightly better.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[fb]LB[fc:A]C[Ilya: Joseki play would be at A. Not sure why.

PC: Your move is also a joseki. The idea of the move at 'a' is that it invites White to cut; Black will then capture the cutting stone, getting good shape and sente while White takes the other side.]

;W[co];B[fq];W[dn];B[cd]LB[gd:A]C[Ilya: Taking the corner and providing safity for my top left group in sente. Any bigger places to play?

PC: Another option would be to play 'a', building along the top edge .]
;W[ce];B[bd];W[be]
(;B[ei]TR[ci]LB[eh:B][gd:A]C[Ilya: Is it too early to run here? Any bigger places to play?

PC: Again, I like 'a' here. It threatens to E11 (or 'b') an attack on the top left White group that could help turn the top edge into your territory. If White responds to 'a' by playing E11 himself, your marked stone still has plenty of aji.]
;W[hd];B[op]SQ[fq]TR[ci][ei]LB[oc:B][od:A][pn:D][qn:C]C[Ilya: It was rather hard to choose where to play. This point or A or B. I've decided that the top side is less interesting then the bottom or the right. Plus I hoped to build some influence which would help marked stones in case of attack.

PC: The bottom isn't very interesting either, with the Black F3 stone being low and easy for White to press down. If White answers at 'c' or 'd' then you don't have a good continuation.]
;W[oq];B[pp]LB[nq:A]C[Going for nadare hoping to build influence and to develop on the right side.

PC: Good,. In this position your move is better than the common joseki at 'a', which would concentrate on the uninteresting bottom edge.]
;W[pq];B[qo];W[rp]LB[qq:A]C[PC: Not a joseki. If White wants to play solidly here, he should connect at 'a'.]
;B[np];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[dh]
(;B[di]LB[cj:A][dk:B][ej:C]C[PC: This looks heavy; Black 'a', White 'b', Black 'c' gives you better shape. It also strengthens White, but White is already pretty strong here, so that's not a problem.]
;W[ek];B[gi];W[od];B[oc]C[Ilya: Any joseki suggestions? I've decide to go for the corner territory hoping to overcentrate white on the "uninteresting" top side.

PC: This looks good to me. A pincer would be asking for trouble with the weak Black group in the centre.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jc]C[Ilya: White played as I expected.]
;B[nq]TR[ci][di][ei][gi]LB[ad:C][bc:A][dd:B][ee:D][fk:E]C[Ilya: I'm not sure about this move. In this position all moves seemed vague and rather meaningless. I've choosed one that looked the lest meaningless to me - the one which constrains the right bottom white group in the corner and which potentially may allow me to build some territory on the lower side.

PC: Difficult. You're a little ahead on territory, assuming that White can't rescue the C17 stone with White 'a' Black 'b' White 'c' because of the cut at 'd', but your marked stones are the only really weak group on the board, so one idea would be to strengthen them with 'e'.]
;W[ii];B[ff]LB[bc:B][fe:A][fk:C]C[Ilya: Trying to destroy white territory here before running. Is it wrong idea?

PC: I'd be worried that White would answer at 'a', activating the aji of rescueing C17 with 'b'. Perhaps better to lean on the strong group below with 'c'.]
;W[ge];B[hg]LB[fk:E][jg:A][oh:D][pe:B][qe:C]C[Ilya: Last white's move allows me to separate the lone white in the center and to try to attack it.

PC: I'm not convinced that this is a good idea. E.g. if White answers at 'a' your group is still weak, and White has the possibility of setting up a moyo with White 'b' Black 'c' White 'd' later. I'd still go for 'e' here.]
;W[ig];B[if]LB[fk:A]C[Ilya: Was it too aggressive? I almost got in the trouble later while trying to attack the center white stones? Am I creating two weak groups here?

PC:  I prefer escaping with 'a' first, leaving this counter-attack for later.]
;W[hh]
(;B[gg];W[hf];B[jf]LB[jg:A]C[PC: Playing the atari at 'a' first give White bad shape, and makes it easier for your stones to escape and harder for White's.]

(;B[ej]LB[jk:C][jl:A][kl:B][lj:D]C[Ilya: It looked to me I got problems with this group - I though white was capable of blocking it with play at A or B . So I tryied to make life in place.

PC:You could escape with 'c' (if White still tries to shut you in with 'b' he gets into all sorts of trouble). However, White could play 'd', and keeping both your groups alive looks difficult. (see variation).]

;B[nh];W[og];B[lj];W[lk];B[kk];W[jk]LB[gj:D][hj:C][jh:A][jj:B]
C[Ilya: Cutting as I saw aji at A and B.

PC: Yes, White probably needed to get the White 'c' Black 'd' exchange in to cover this.]
;B[kl];W[jl];B[lm];W[mm];B[ln];W[ok];B[jj]C[Ilya: White missed the aji.]
;W[ij];B[jh];W[ji];B[ih]SQ[lk][mk][mm][ok]C[PC: Well read. Now you have about 45 points to White's 40, and White is the one with the weak stones to worry about.]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[mo];B[or]TR[kk][kl][lm][ln][lo]LB[lp:B][qq:A]
C[PC: A bit risky. The cut at 'a' doesn't kill the White group, so White has time to go after your marked stones with 'b'.It seems, though, that you can cope with this attack (see variation).]

(;W[pr];B[lp];W[on];B[om];W[oo];B[po];W[ol];B[iq]C[PC: That seems to settle everything.]
