C[I felt I played this game well and was surprised that I lost

[dmg\] Hello, I'm Damien 6k european and 4k on OGS. I'll comment your game by prefixing my comments with "[dmg\]". Basically you lost this game earlier than you think. You were ahead on the start of the game but you let your opponent invades easily and you did not concretized your points.]
;B[pq];W[pd];B[cp];W[dd];B[qo]C[How do I attack the C4 stone from above?
[dmg\] The way you did it seems ok for me.];W[ep];B[jp]C[[dmg\] This pincer is non standard. It does not really attacks E4 and, since there is no black stones on the right side it does not constructs a big framework so the pincer should narrow the white stone]
;W[co];B[dp]C[[dmg\] Black mistake.];W[do];B[bo];W[bn];B[bp]
(;W[en]C[[dmg\] This is a mistake, this move should be on E5 or maybe E3 (see variations)]
;B[eq];W[dj]C[I seem to have a lot of territory here
[dmg\] You should probably hane first. Be hard on the corner. Black shape is defective in the corner and white has more potential it is due to black mistake at D4. So yes you must be happy :)]
;B[jc];W[lc];B[fc];W[ec]C[[dmg\] Fan Hui told me this is not correct because of the four space jump you removing the H17 attacks. So C14 is probably better. However I cannot deny that move :)]
;B[fd];W[df]C[[dmg\] C14 instead, locking the corner];B[kd]
C[[dmg\] Be happy, black is helping you];W[ld];B[ke];W[qm]C[Is this move better or Q10?

[dmg\] Q10 is really big and here you are calling to get pinced.]
;B[qk]C[[dmg\] There you go];W[qi]C[Not sure how to rescue R7

[dmg\] Not sure you should rescue R7. This move seems reasonable.]
;B[rm];W[pk];B[ql];W[qf];B[pl];W[mq]C[What is the best way to invade here? N4 would be better move?

[dmg\] Should you invade? I think F3 is urgent destructing the border.]
;B[lo];W[kr];B[ir];W[or];B[pr];W[oq];B[op];W[np];B[oo];W[kp]
;B[ko];W[jq];B[lp];W[kq]C[[dmg\] See variation.];B[iq];W[mp]
;B[lq];W[lr];B[io];W[nr];B[dh]C[[dmg\] You must be hard on this one push on the top (E13)]
;W[cg];B[ch];W[ci]C[[dmg\] Bad shape (C11 - C13 is a tobi and you get a cutted tobi)]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[bg];W[bf];B[dg];W[cf];B[di];W[ck];B[fh];W[ff]
C[Should I have played C17 here?

[dmg\] No this is correct];B[gf]C[I seem to have much more territory in general. how did I lose this game?
[dmg\] You were too soft on corner attacks];W[cc];B[fg];W[fe]
;B[ge];W[jn];B[jo];W[mf];B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[qe]C[[dmg\] Consider S15.]
;B[pb];W[ob];B[qb]
(;W[oe]C[[dmg\] You lose a move. there is no need, see variation]
;B[pj]C[Did I lose the game here, and the following moves?
[dmg\] You lose the game on the previous move];W[ok]C[[dmg\] mistake. Don't save this one, kill black corner...]
;B[qj];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj];W[mn];B[mo]C[Black's built up a larger territory now]
;W[no];B[nn];W[on];B[nm];W[km];B[lm];W[kl];B[in];W[im];B[kn]
;W[hm];B[fp]C[[dmg\] very big];W[fj];B[mi];W[hi];B[hg];W[jh]
SQ[fb][kb][rd][ri]C[[dmg\] Dame, it is really small compared to the squared point]
;B[jg];W[kj];B[kh];W[ji];B[gn];W[gm]C[

I thought I was winning here

[dmg\] Nop score estimation is around 50points behind. Killing the corner is still possible]
;B[fn];W[fm];B[eo];W[dn];B[ed];W[ee]C[[dmg\] This is small (only 2 stones, around 5points) compared to E18 (or compared to S16 :P)]
