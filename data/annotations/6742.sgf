C[hi review,

I played black and I think i made mistake during opening
--
Hi Teddy.  I have marked my comments with CL.

Your opening was quite good, but the transition between opening and midgame was not so good.  

There were several intances where you held on to heavy stones and others where you took big points rather than urgent points (defending a group).

Overall, the ko in the lower right was the most expensive mistake.  After it you were behind and the rest of the game was hard.  You were a little lucky with white's mistake in the upper left but did not quite manage to punish white for it.

If you have any further questions, please send me an email.

;W[en];B[dm];W[ed];B[ee]C[CL: Attaching seems slightly wrong.  When you attach you will get a better result on the left at the expense of a worse result on the top.  I think you would be better playing slightly further away here (E14 or D13)]

CL: As I mentioned when you played O5, I would not have chosen it, but I don't think it is a big problem]

It looks like black is in trouble here, but thinking about it more, I think this move is a mistake.

White is ahead, so all white needs to do to win is live comfortably in the corner.  Something like F18 instead, or even C18 seems plenty.

This move gives black a chance to win, and a chance to lose by even more - so not  a good strategy by white]
