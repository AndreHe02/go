GC[Dear Darrell,

here comes the review of your game. I have to warn you, i am 5k* on IGS so don't take me too seriously. Maybe thinks that i want to teach you are not worth to teach and my oppinions are wrong. But lets try:

You both took san-ren-sei and in most games with this fuseki there are lots of ig figths in it. This si the nature of san-ren-sei. So nothing is wrong that on the top side of the board a figth begins. In a figth it is important to have some room to operate, so this side, which can make a basis, often has the better chances. There is nothing difficult with this. So try to look for some easy ways to figth and be always one step in front of your opponent. The complicater a variation, the more likely you miss the best move and the initiative slips away.

I hope i could help you a bit and you have a bit fun with the review.]


;C[Reviewer:  Hi, I'm snip, playing white in this game.
This was a LeapFrog trourney game I played recently.

I am most interested in the opening sequence as I felt like I had virtually lost the game by move 45.

I'll add a few additional questions throughout the record.  But please comment on anything you think will help!  Thank you in advance for your help!

;W[jp];B[jj];W[nq];B[no]LB[qq:a][qn:b]C[I didn't know what to do with this really.  It seems consistent with the big moyo built up and I didn't want to play low, like at the 3-3 point, and make it bigger.

playing at (a) would be a good idea too.]
(;W[hc]C[also a good idea to tenuki (especially if i dont know what to do in the lower right :-))]

(;W[jf]LB[ld:a]C[This is probably where I started going wrong, but I felt I had the stone at k16 outnumbered and could break up the moyo fairly easily and then make black deal with the white moyo.  It didn't go well though.

A good technic if you play against handicap :), otherwise maybe overplay

I dont know what exactly you mean with "outnumbered". The black stone is not captured and your two stones may become very weak in the coming figth. Your idea seems right. Making an enemy stone weak for breaking into the moyo while figthing against it. But i think the better move would be at (a) here.]

;B[jb];W[lb];B[ja];W[id]C[At this point, I am just trying to build some thickness out of this loss.  The move is sente though since it threatens L16 to capture the M16 group.]
;B[ka]
(;W[nh]C[I don't have much hope in the game if this group dies too.

Yes, but actually this group is very heavy, and becomes heavier each move you add too. What about to think to abandon it anyway and try to gain more in the centre? Your last move directs in right this direction.]

;B[hf];W[kd];B[ma];W[jc];B[pk];W[cf]C[Is this the best move here?

Yes (at least in my eyes, i am a 5kyu only)

Lets make a rough estimate on the score :)

first there are no weak white groups on teh board that you have to look at. the black stones in the centre are very weak. If black makes his stones around H14 alive you get the whole left side ore black invades the left side and lives there while you capture the H14-group.

Now stands your left against black's right. This is about equal. The upper and lower sides are split in two but you will get more on the lower side than black, even if O3 is captured by black. Then you have the centre-group where is no compensation for black. I think you are leading very comfortable.]

(;C[Black loses on time.

He is lost anyway. Lower left corner is KO and left side is dead after white playes B12.

To count:

Black:
80 points on the rigth and upper side.
6 points on the lower left, if he wins the KO,
7 prisoners
Total ca. 93 points

White:
106 points only in the centre, if black brings both groups left and corner to alive.

I think your game was not bad, but you tend to makes thinks a bit complicated.     First think about the easy way. Only if it didn't work search for another way and than look for a complicate way to play.]

black didnt make effektiv use of his san-ren-sei, the moyo is spoiled on the lower part and the marked stone is on the wrong place (should be on O4) and nevertheless white has sente.]
