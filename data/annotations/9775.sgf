AB[pd][dp]C[I'm not very good at openings of a game as you will probably see from this game, this is especially true when I have a handicap though that doesn't seem to make much sense.

Reviewer (comments after reviewing whole game):  It was an exciting game.  I actually think that you opened well.  You built a beautiful and large territorial framework.  It was in the midgame, the heavy fighting, that I thought you were somewhat weak.  First white broke into your center territory and did a lot of damage; then they almost captured your upper left group.  In the late midgame you rallied dramatically and broke into White's large territory, captured a group, and saved your upper left group.  White's missing the abou-to-be-captured group did win the game for you, but does it matter if it's your skill or the opponent's mistake that wins the game?  I think not.

Overall, I think you played well.  I wouldn't worry about your openings; where I think you need to improve is whole-board thinking and keeping track of groups and potential territories.]
;W[dd];B[oo]C[Reviewer: When you start with a handicap, you have an advantage right from the get-go.  So you don't need to be aggressive - all you have to do is maintain the lead you already have.

Starting in a corner on the 5-5 point is a very aggressive move, but open to attack and not necessary when you begin with two stones already on the board.  3-3 might have been better, because you could still work towards a territorial framework but be much more secure.]
;W[nc];B[ph];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[qd];W[rb]C[This is a common shape to watch out for.  Connecting at S16 is necessary or white can capture the stone.]

(;B[es]C[It usually isn't necessary to play in the very edge spaces until the endgame.  If white takes this point it won't make hardly any difference in your territory, and you could solidify your position with a move like K4 or pressure white with something like D7]
;W[ds];B[cm]C[This move creates what is called an elephant's eye.  White can cut it easily with this:]

(;W[pp]C[This is why the 5-5 is difficult.  White's invasion stone will almost certainly live.]
;B[qq]C[This isn't necessarily a bad response, but you'll see that it makes an elephant's eye again.  It didn't happen here, but white could cut your stones apart.]

;B[dl];W[bk];B[em];W[cm];B[ck];W[al];B[dk]C[It was good to connect here.  It prevented a second white cut.  Now a stone at the center pint would have made at least half the board yours.]

;B[el];W[fj];B[ej];W[ei];B[di];W[ek]C[You see now that white is starting to eat into your lovely center territory.  When you have a large territorial framework, large enough to win, your effort needs to be focused on defending it and not trying to take more.]

;W[hf];B[op]C[This move was unnecessary.  Both of your groups are secure and there is no need to connect them.  But if white captures the upper left group they will have a very big territory.  The move H14 clearly indicates that white wants to capture it; you need to defend it now.]

(;W[fe]C[Opponent made a bad move and wanted to change it.

Reviewer: The bad move was not to play K19.  If white had, their group would have lived and they might still have killed your group.  White K15 was crucial; you your group doesn't have two eyes.  You needed to take that point ASAP  If the upper white group had not been killed, you in all likelihood would have.]
