C[Hello ! I am black (Tilwen) in this game, and it was all about the lower right corner, I had a chinese fuseki and he came just the place I wanted, but then I think my attack didn't go as well as I would have liked, could you tell me, in the early moves, if the choices were good, and in the later ones, where my strataegy and tactic failed ?
  Thanks by advance :)

S*: Hi. My name is Shane and I am 2d, and I'll be reviewing. The first moves were very standard each player keeping it simple staking out large territory. White chose to invade first and the game became a complicated early fight that decided the game. As you asked, I will focus on that first fight and joseki mostly since that is where the game happened. I'll maybe exaust most of my comments on the first 50 moves with less comments later. Thanks for the chance to review.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]LB[jp:a][fq:b]
C[Black follows up with A (no problem)
But I prefer B, it is more active and takes away white's chance to expand there.]
(;B[jp]LB[fq:a][gq:b][ci:c]C[S*: This move is fine, but I prefer a move at A because it is much more active. Follow previous move for more explanation.

White chose C, which is okay but defending the bottom at A or B is larger because it prevents black from playing there and helps indirecly with approaching at Q5 later.]
(;W[ci]LB[gq:a][fq:b]C[S*: This is certainly a valid move but defending the lower right (at A or B) seems better to me personally. see variation on previous move.]
;B[fq]C[Here is the perfect chinese fuseki i was thinking, and then he came on Q5

S*: Yes. Black can be happy, although with komi it is still an even game. But black has kept the momentum of going first.]
(;W[po]LB[lo:a]C[S*: White plays tenuki to try and get some momentum. You really wanted to exploit this, but it is a valid move. White is cramped but there is not a chance for death. He will invade the right side (which will leave holes in the upper right too, but you should benefit on the bottom side.

White could also consider the reducing move at A (see variation).]
;B[np]C[This was mandatory I guess ...

S*: It is most normal move although some other moves have been tried professionally. This uses the pincer stone while making territorial prospects on the bottom.]
;W[qq]C[S*: Almost the only thinkable move.];B[qr]LB[qp:a][no:b]
[pr:c]C[S*: Natural and correct.  White follows up with A which is normal, attaching at B then crosscutting at C is also sabaki technique which works well against high chinese fuseki (see variations).]
(;W[qp]LB[or:a][rr:b][qm:c]C[... but what to play here ? I choose the pincer, thinking my stones at K4 and even maybe F3 will only help me and will make it hard for him.

S*: Next Black 17 was the mistake. If we consider normal joseki (not in chinese fuseki), one would see the move at A. But that does not pressure white to live. In the chinese fuseki, it is standard to play at B to keep up the pressure.  You pincered at C which is redundant because you already have a pincer on that side. Explore variations for more detail.]
(;B[qm]C[S*: This is black's mistake. He already has a pincer, losing the territorial position on the bottom seems to be a mistake. Also the upper right can still be invaded so this move doesn't solidify enough territory to be good.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[op];W[pp];B[pr];W[mq];B[mp];W[lq]LB[lp:a]
[rq:b]C[I followed a joseki I found on josekipedia (but without K4 in place), but here I was thinking M4 was getting closer to K4 and still sente and strong. Was I right ?

S*: Yes this fight is difficult for W because he needs to make two groups live in black's strong area. But... If he does, black has lost in the lower right and on the bottom. Black must kill a group or get a very strong attack from this or his game could slip away. 

Black decides to push one more time at A, but I don't think it is not good, black should live in the corner then seal white in on the right or the bottom.]
(;B[lp]SQ[jp][fq]C[S*: I think this extra push hurts because it provokes white to get more liberties and black still has a whole in his shape. It weakens the two marked stones and black's four stones are essentially as strong as the three (see var)]
;W[kq];B[rq];W[rp];B[rr]LB[sq:a]C[S*: Instead of B 31, decending at A seems better.]
;W[kp]MA[jp]LB[lp:a][kq:b]C[S*: Black's exchanged A for B then lived in the corner. This damaged the K4 stone.]
;B[on]C[Maybe this should have come in L5 ?

S*: Its difficult to tell. Black's shape is a little broken and this seems fine because Black hopes to kill the right side with this and will try to make sabaki on the bottom with his other two stones.]
;W[oo];B[mn];W[nn];B[ln];W[pm]LB[qn:a][pn:b]C[S*: Black plays A. Perhaps B is better (var)]
(;B[qn];W[pn];B[ql];W[jo]MA[jp]C[Maybe I should have played L5 at some point, instead of defending on the right side ...

S*: Black seems to have an attack on the right. He can't have the bottom too! But damaging the K4 stone is really coming back to haunt black.]
;B[ip];W[kn];B[ll]C[But even now I was thinking white is weaker than black, I still have good chances to get benefits.

S*: Yes. But the bottom side should have been black's so this is still an even game if white escapes well.]
;W[nl];B[km];W[jm];B[jl];W[io];B[hp];W[nk];B[im]C[Is this a mistake ?

S*: seems fine.];W[hn];B[jn];W[ko]C[S*: This was good for B. His center stones are now strong. White has two weak groups black has one.]
;B[fo];W[gm]LB[en:a][fm:b]C[S*: Black plays A. B seems better (leaning to attack the corner).]
(;B[en]C[S*: This move seems soft.];W[cn];B[el];W[gk]LB[ej:a]
[cl:b]C[Black plays A. Perhaps B is better.]
(;B[ej]C[keep white separated ...

S*: Yes, but neglects to pressure the corner.];W[dk]C[S*: White is happy to play this move.]
;B[fl];W[gl];B[fj];W[nr];B[os];W[hj];B[kj];W[ni];B[pi];W[ii]
C[S*: So after this fight. Black only made progress on the right. He is now left with two weak groups again in the center. White also has two weak groups. The game is still in the air. Black though has no moyo (white has invaded all his formations). White still has some territorial formations. If white reaches safety, the game seems to favor him.]
;B[kh];W[df]C[Here the game seemed like, if everybody lives, making no points in the middle, white is ahead ...

S*: yes. agreed.];B[oj]C[S*: I don't like this peep. I'd rather try to wedge later. You don't really need to defend this territory more. It is a thank you move, helping white fix a defect.]
;W[nj];B[om]C[S*: This too seems a waste.];W[ol];B[mg];W[mm]
;B[ml];W[ng];B[nf];W[mh]LB[og:a][lg:b]C[S*: White 86 secures life. Black tries A and it won't keep white in. Black B will seal white in, but he has two eyes.]
(;B[og]C[Here is probably a big mistake ...];W[lg];B[nh];W[li]
;B[lh]C[or this ... I think after this white has the game, but an other question is, like earlier, when everybody lives, what are the benefits black got from the battle ? He was strong and get not much, maybe less than white ... I thnk there were possibilities in the left side, but white potential territory seems bigger than black's ...

   I wondered if black missed a big point at some point, or played in a bad direction, or missed a chance to kill white and live, because i got a bit frustrated seeing that nice chinese fuseki not played well :)
    Thanks for your help !

  I think there are some points in the following, but probably none I can handle myself ! (maybe only the ending of this battle for life/death)]
;W[ki];B[mi];W[mj]SQ[nl][ol][pm][pn]LB[ji:a][lj:b]C[S*: You moved at A. I think B is better. It will try to live inside which seems possible. Then the marked stones have only 1 eye.]
(;B[ji];W[lj];B[jj];W[jh];B[ij];W[jg]LB[in:a]C[S*: Moving at A seems to keep black alive.]
(;B[kg]C[This is probably a mistake too ...];W[nm];B[lm];W[ik]
;B[jk];W[il]SQ[nm][nn][oo][op][np][mp][mn][mm]C[S*: Now white wins. White has more liberties on the marked group. End of comments
