AB[pd][dp]C[g: I added some variations to the game. These variations are an idea, how to coninue the game. If you can find better moves, feel free to use your own moves. 

Gerhard];W[dd];B[pp];W[nc]C[Is this appropriate?

g: This move seems OK.];B[cm]C[g: This move is very slow.];W[pb]
C[g: I feel a bit unsure about this move. It helps black to enlare his handicap lead. See variations of the next move.]

(;B[qf];W[qc]C[g: Good move.];B[qd];W[pk]C[Too high?

g: Good move. Although I had played it on the 3rd line.];B[dj]
MA[jq][jp][cf][df][qi]C[g: This move is very slow. One of the marked points were bigger. White can now take an advantage.]
;W[cg]C[g: This move is very slow, too. K3 is much bigger.]
;B[jd];W[kc];B[qk]C[What is proper reponse to this?

g: I think your response is good enough. I added variations of other possible variations.]

(;W[pn];B[qn];W[qm];B[qo];W[pl];B[qj]
(;W[pj]C[g. This is a mistake. Stepping ahead is important here.]
;B[pi];W[rn]MA[jq]C[g: This would be a good move in the endgame. In this part of the game, one of the marked point is much bigger.]
;B[ro]
(;W[sn]C[g: This move is bad because you have to protect against the cut at S7. See variation.]
;B[so];W[rl];B[ql]MA[qj][qk]C[g: This is a mistake. White can now capture the marked stones.]

(;W[rk]C[g: Instead of this, white can capture three black stones. See variations.]
;B[rj];W[sm]C[g: This is a mistake of white. It does not make territory. It does not make an eye and it doesn't attack black.]
;B[oi]C[g: This black move is very good. It makes territory while attacking the white group. White has to run away.]
;W[sk]C[g: Note that white has only one eye so far.];B[rc]
(;W[pc]C[g: White need not to give away the corner. See variation.]
;B[rb];W[kq];B[mq];W[hq];B[gq];W[hp];B[gp];W[gr]C[g: This move is very bad. It gives black a big lead in territory. Invading at C3 is much bigger.]
;B[fr];W[gs]C[g: Again, h2 is better.];B[fs];W[ir];B[fq]C[g: Black has a big lead in territory now.]
;W[lo];B[lp];W[kp];B[lq];W[jo];B[kr];W[jr];B[ks];W[js];B[mr]
;W[go];B[fo];W[gn];B[fn];W[lm];B[mo];W[mn]C[I'm noticing I'm a little over-concenrated at the bottom, but I need to expand to the center because I didn't think that the D16 area would be able to push into the center very much because I would have to defend the corner.

g: Note that black has about 90 points of territory and white has about 20. Also note that there is no territory at all so far at the d16 area. Black can hardly lose.]
;B[no];W[nn];B[on];W[om];B[oo];W[gc]MA[dd][cg]C[g: This shape is bad because black can still invade at C17.]
;B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[kd];B[ke]
(;W[le]C[g: Herre you can cut. See variation.];B[kf];W[lf];B[lg]
;W[mg];B[lh];W[mh]C[Should I be worrying about being cut along that wall?

g: Black has to worry. White should cut.];B[li];W[mi];B[mj]

(;W[ni]C[g: bad move. See variation.];B[oj]
(;W[qi]C[Needed T10 before R11, is that correct?

g: T10 takes away six or points of the black territory in sente. See variation.]
;B[ri];W[qh];B[rh];W[ph];B[oh];W[ok];B[pg];W[og];B[qg];W[of]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[pf];W[od];B[pe]
(;W[bi]C[Good play, or should I push into the center?  I was divided between this and something like F13

g: This is a big point. But white can cut the black wall. See variation.]
;B[bj];W[ci];B[cj];W[di];B[ei];W[fm];B[em];W[fl];B[el]
(;W[ek]C[g: This is a mistake. Black can cut. See variation.]

;B[fg];W[gh];B[gi];W[fi];B[fh];W[hi];B[hh];W[gj];B[gg];W[gi]
;B[ih];W[ii];B[jh]C[g: These sequence helps white to get a big territory, while black only gets a few points. Black should have reduced white's moyo by walking into (on L9, for example). Later, black could invade at C17 and white can't win the game anymore.]
;W[ji];B[ki];W[kj];B[lj];W[lk];B[mk];W[kk];B[ml];W[mm];B[nj]
MA[cc]C[g: White should secure the corner by playing at the marked point, since black can invade there.]
;W[nl];B[ee];W[de];B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[fb];B[fd];W[db]C[g: Now the corner is secure. Black is still about ten points ahead now. Let's see what has happened in the endgame.]
;B[hc];W[hb]C[Hmm, G16 better here?

g: Right. G16 is definitively better.];B[gd];W[gb];B[ib];W[cq]
C[g: If black answers correctly, it doesn't work.];B[cr];W[br]
;B[dr];W[cp];B[bo];W[co];B[cn];W[bp];B[ap]C[g: That's black's mistake. Now white lives.]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[an]C[Big mistake, doh!

g: White should capture.];B[am]C[g: Now white is dead.]
(;W[ao]C[That was pretty pointless too, A3 would be better, correct?

g: No. white is dead anyway. See variations.];B[do];W[aq]C[g: White is alive. Now white leads by about five points.]
;B[dq];W[cs];B[ds];W[bs];B[cc]C[Normally B should not live here, correct?  I think I didn't do something right, and B ended up living.

g: Right. Black can't live.]
(;W[cd]C[g: This move works. D17 were maybe better, because if black playes there later, white might get into trouble. See variation.]
;B[ef];W[df];B[ha];W[ga];B[ia];W[qq]MA[dc]C[I should be able to live here, correct?  If so, can I see a variation, because I messed it up.

g: White can't live here. White should connect at the marked point.]

(;B[rr]C[g: This is an unusual move. But it works.];W[qr];B[rq]
;W[or];B[qs];W[ps];B[rs];W[pq];B[qp];W[ns];B[lr];W[nr];B[oq]
C[I should have abandoned it here, but I had seen how he played, and there was the possibility that he would make a mistake (as in he didn't pick up at Q2), and I was using the knowledge that if I play and he plays, the net result is zero.

g: As soon as black doesn't play, white lose one point. As soon as you can see, that there is no way to live, you should play elsewhere to leave the remaining moves as ko threads.]
;W[nq];B[op];W[ms];B[mp];W[ll]C[g: White should connect at D17.]
;B[ai];W[ah];B[aj];W[qa]C[I couldn't figure out where to play there, any suggestions?]
;B[ra];W[sj];B[si];W[qb]C[I was thinking I could possibly cut and catpure the S18 group, but realized later that it was not really possible, or is it?

g: This move is worth one point. If black plays here, white connect at Q19 and has one point less.]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[po];W[pm];B[ka]
