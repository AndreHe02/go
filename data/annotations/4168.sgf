RE[W+28.5]

C[[Way*\] - Hi, I'm playing black this game.  I've been struggling with the concept of using thickness to attack.  I sort of understand it, but I have a hard time executing it.  That was my primary goal in this game - to learn how to do just that.

[Way*\] - Thanx for the comments!

DC - Hi, My main strengths are in fuseki and direction of play. Using thickness is a key part of direction of play.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp]
(;B[jp]C[DC - Should be a line lower the stone is a little useless/unsettled otherwise. the usual idea with this fuseki is to deny white the 'perfect approach move at r15, q15.]
;W[lp];B[fq]C[[Way*\] - I'm aware of the "If 1 extend 2" proverb, but I was hoping this move would force white to defend his corner.

DC - You are a move behind locally, why should white defend.]
;W[hq]
(;B[hp]C[[Way*\] - I'm not sure what the appropriate response was, but I felt connecting my stones was the most important thing I could do in this area.

DC - Jumping in 3/3 is feasable leaving K4 'light'. Playing profitably is a feasable strategy as it is easier to evaluate the board.]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[ip];B[iq];W[ho];B[hr];W[fp];B[hp];W[io]C[[Way*\] - Not a good exchange for me.  White gets lots of thickness, my group has maybe 1 eye.]
;B[qe];W[kq];B[jq];W[qn];B[kd]C[DC - Too many stones invested in the topside. C6 would be more whole board.]
;W[nc]
(;B[me]C[[Way*\] - I was trying "Attack with a knight's move."

DC - The attacking move may be too 'tight', Give white a little more 'slack' for guaranteed continuous harasment.]
;W[ne];B[mf]C[[Way*\] - I think this was a mistake.  I should've done a hane instead.  I thought it would be okay to build a wall along the N15-N13 line, which is why I extended instead of using a hane.]
;W[md];B[ld];W[lc];B[kc];W[lb]C[DC - Whites shape is settled]
;B[od];W[nd];B[kb]C[[Way*\] - This move seems small.  I think R10 would've been better, or C 10.

DC - Yes, F17 area is too open to call territory anyway.];W[of]
;B[pg];W[og];B[ph];W[oh];B[pi];W[qk]C[[Way*\] - Was this a "I should've gone there" move?  Perhaps my move at Q11 should've been at R10.

DC - Left side is very open. As a guide Try to : 1. look for weaknesses in the opp. position. else 2. Defend weaknesses in your own position, and finally if neither. 3. Play in the most open area.]
;B[dj]C[[Way*\] - I was debating between this move and the shimari at E17.  however, I felt that my thickness at L16 would help me attack any stones white puts in the upper left area.]
;W[ec]
(;B[gc]C[[Way*\] - Is this the correct way to attack white?

DC - Maybe the high pincer is better here as it prevents forcing moves by white and works well with the wall.]
;W[ee];B[df];W[gd];B[hd];W[ge]C[[Way*\] - I end up giving white good shape; in exchange, I've made territory on the left.]
;B[he];W[cm]C[[Way*\] - Big move.  I should've seen this.];B[cq]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[do]
;W[cn];B[bp]C[[Way*\] - I get the corner in gote, and he has to deal with the D5 cut.]
;W[el];B[pk]C[[Way*\] - This was supposed to be a leaning attack: white would hane at Q8, and I would extend at P9, attacking the white group and upper right.]
;W[qj];B[pj];W[mh]
(;B[kg]C[DC - Ask yourself what does this move actually do. 1. It does not attack any weakness. 2. It does not defent any weakness in your position. and it is certainly not the biggest move on the board.]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[jr];B[kp];W[lq];B[kn];W[lo];B[jn];W[hm]
(;B[dl]C[DC - Playing toward a thick white position. Sine you have played L13. Seal white in.]
;W[ek];B[dk];W[dm];B[eo]C[[Way*\] - The following sequence doesn't work.]
;W[fo];B[en];W[ep];B[em];W[fm];B[ej];W[mm];B[jl];W[bk];B[bj]
;W[cb];B[dc];W[db];B[bc];W[de];B[ce];W[dd];B[gk];W[fl];B[mb]
;W[mc]C[DC - If you seal white in first he/she may have to add a move to save the group. Then you can play san san bottom right.]
;B[lj];W[li]
(;B[ki]C[[Way*\] - Wrong side, I think.  N10 better?  It would drive him left toward my other influence.]
;W[mj];B[ni]C[[Way*\] - I think this royally screwed me over.]
;W[nh];B[mi];W[oi];B[nj];W[oj];B[nk];W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[mk]
;W[pl];B[om]C[[Way*\] - I then proceed to misread the following fight.  I thought I could kill the O8 stones, but I made an error reading the outcome.]
;W[pm];B[nm];W[ml];B[mn];W[ln];B[pn]C[[Way*\] - This move is intended for a sequence to give me sente with a move at R11.]
;W[on];B[ql];W[qm];B[qi];W[rl];B[pq]C[[Way*\] - I think I can live in ko down here, not sure.]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[[Way*\] - This was a mistake.  I should've done a double-hane instead (which was the other move I was considering).

DC - It just seems you have given white an easy time in this game. Try to keep the game simple with clear ideas of what you want to do and implementing them will become a lot more natural to you.]
;W[rp];B[qr];W[rq];B[op];W[po];B[oq];W[rr];B[ps];W[mr];B[ll]
;W[lm];B[ef]C[[Way*\] - I'm not sure where to go next.  I cannot prevent white from coming out to the center with his upper white group, nor can I really attack it.  I felt secure with my K4 group, but I find out later that it really isn't secure.]

DC - Mainly due to the way you attacked whites N17 group. With the invasion then coming in the bottom right after making white very strong locally.]
