C[Me, Joachim (24k*) played this game against a played at similar level (23k).
At the end, I had 50 points and white 104.5, although I lost only some small fights.
My mistakes are thus on the tactical side, I guess. I would appreciate very much to get some hints where things went wrong for me. In too many situations, I had the feeling that my group had to run for life. My major question is how to play in the opening to avoid these "run away" situations.

Of course, comments on all the other mistakes, I made are also welcome.

Joachim

io: Hi Joachim! 
This is my first review. I'll do my best to give useful hints but please remember, my comments are certainly not the only truth.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[qd];W[dd]
(;B[fc]LB[fc:1][oc:2]C[io: You asked how to avoid "runaway situations". 
Though this move is just fine, you can expect your opponent to play at the upper side aswell, wich will probably lead to a run for at least one of you.]
;W[df]
(;B[dc]LB[db:3][dc:1][hd:2]C[io: D17 might be ok. 
I would prefere H16 (2). White won't pincer you so easily (see variation).
If you like going for the corner you probably shouldn't attach. Attaching to an opponent stone strengthens your opponent too and you don't get more points playing at 1 instead of 3.]
;W[cc]
(;B[db]TR[ed][hd]C[io: I don't know... You are right, those D17 stones need some friends around but now it seems too crowded. 
I'd think about a move at one of the triangles instead of D18.]
;W[oc]
(;B[pc]C[io: You can play this move, but... (next black move)

(By the way: I don't like that move. Again it's an attachment to a (weak) opponent stone and after what happened in the game it certainly strenthened white. 
The variations on this move are only some ideas for you.)];W[od]

(;B[kc]C[io: ...if you play Q17, don't stay away now! (see variation)]
;W[hc];B[fe];W[he];B[ke];W[ff]C[Here, I felt trapped the first time.
My stones in the upper board are split in three groups and the D18 group is too compact, whereas the white stone seem beautifully connected.

I continued to play "ugly" and tried to push through.

I would rather have tried to play a lightly as white, but I did not know how and I was afraid for my D18 group.

io: I would feel pretty much the same. :(
It sure hurts to lose the D17 group, but I can't see a way to get them out now.
Maybe it is best to just give them up and go for something else.]
;B[ee];W[ef]
(;B[de]LB[cd:2][de:1]C[Should I better have cut at C16 here?

io: Hard to decide...
The cut at least seems to put some live into that poor black group. (Gives you about three points of "territory" if white plays good.)
At the same time white puts up a solid wall (he already does now) wich will make it hard(er) for you to invade the left side if you want to try that later.]
;W[ce];B[cb];W[qe]C[io: well... back at move 13...];B[re];W[pd]
;B[rc];W[pb];B[qb];W[qc];B[rd];W[mf]C[same story, I am clearly in a bad situation.]
;B[jg];W[hg];B[bc];W[cd]
(;B[pe]C[io: It's a good idea to put R15 into atari... (see variation)]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qg];B[pg];W[qh];B[ph]C[The Q15 group has also been a bad idea due to N14. I guess, I should not have ignored that.]
;W[qj]LB[ra:2][pc:1]
(;B[pc]LB[ra:2][pc:1]C[io: What is this about?];W[oj];B[qc]
C[io: You just gave two bonus-moves to white.];W[mc]TR[jq]SQ[ck]
[dk][qn][fq][nq]C[io: Luckily white neglected to use them very well!
Half the board is still free - for both of you. For example one could go somewhere around the squares.]
;B[ni];W[qn];B[qo]C[io: This is almost the same as move 11. The difference is: white's R6 stone is already strong wich seems to make this move even worse.]
;W[nq];B[pr];W[oo]TR[cj][cn][fq][iq]SQ[kc][ke][pe][pf][jg][pg]
[lh][ph][ni]C[io: Oh dear... Corner-collection almost completed? ;o)
There is still some unexplored space on the board. Go for one of the triangles to get some of it.
The black L15 and Q13 groups don't look so good either! A stone at M12 would force the white N17 stones to do something for live. Even if black can't kill them it will keep white busy for now and helps black to connect the groups and get out to the center. Maybe you can at least find some space for eyes there!?!

Imagin how a white or a black stone would look in any of these places.

DON'T you play a small move like P18 now! No, don't, NO...]
;B[ob]C[io: ..........*sob* :..(
How much is this? One point?];W[nb];B[pa];W[ld];B[kd];W[lh]
C[io: Well, too late!];B[li];W[jh];B[hd];W[gd];B[hb];W[ge];B[ic]
;W[gc];B[gb];W[fd];B[ec];W[ed];B[fq]C[io: Finally! :)];W[hq]
C[io: Note that this white pincer is an almost ideal extention from the O3 and P5 stones. 
(Actually I don't think you could invade anywhere in this situation not doing white a favour at the same time.)]
;B[fo];W[ho];B[fm];W[dm]
(;B[dq]C[io: attach?

(I DON'T say you should never ever play an attachment again, but think if there isn't a move that will do just the same for you.)]
;W[cq];B[dr];W[ek];B[ng]TR[jj][gk][kk][lk][mk]C[io: You can't do much harm to the white stones any longer. 
Do you get eye-space (let alone territory) from playing at O13? - I don't think so!
How about a black (or a white) stone at one of the triangles?]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[ih];B[gk]TR[ci][cj]C[I think, from here on, I kind of accepted that I only had small life in the four corners and all the rest belongs to white. What else could I have done that to try reducing white's space?

io: White is just everywere on that board (and everywere quite strong). If you keep him out at one side he comes in at the other...
You could try a last invasion at one of the marked points. That's a bit of a kamikaze-operation after white has put some more stones there but hey, nothing to lose anyway!
What's more important: link up the F5 group and the Q13 group! Especially the Q13 stones don't look as if they can survive on their own.]

;B[ij];W[jj];B[ji];W[ii];B[jk];W[nl];B[cm]LB[cn:A]TR[ci][cj]
SQ[lb][sh][gi][ll][an][nr]C[io: This is risky. What if white plays at A? 
If you want to invade (it's to late now) don't play so close to opponent's stones but for example at the triangles.
If you want to reduce think about the points marked with squares. (Is it gote or sente? Play sente moves first. Wich one might be the biggest? Can you think of a follow up?)]

io: F8 is not a point, it's neutral unless you count chinese.

A general advice for you: lean back sometimes during the game and look at the hole board.
Try to play moves wich do several things at one time, e.g. pincer and  extention (w74 is such a move).
Keep playing and have fun!])
