C[um, this is my first time using the review system. I was white in this game. I read the FAQ for which games to send and i don't think its close (i lost by a lot), but the other reasons seem to fit and i want to know how to improve on this game. Thankyou for reviewing!

> Hi ! I marked strength with squares, weakness with triangles. You'll find a summary at the end of the game.

[os]C[> Summary.

* Strategy

White lost control early in the game due to failing to take sente (H18), then playing into a pincer (H3). This gave Black a thick game.

Then White lost chances to complicate the game by strengthening Black without need (P17, R9, P13).

As a result White ends up with five groups to Black two.

* Tactics

For urgent defense, use contact play and sacrifice some stones. White lost a lot in the corner (B4 C4) because of previous heavy play.

When confronted with a cut, consider both directions before you chose to atari (J3 vs. K4).]
