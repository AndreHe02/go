;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[pj];W[dj];B[jd]C[So far so good, though a play at k17 may be stronger at this stage]
;W[jp];B[np]C[This is small, extend to f17 instead, or n3 if you want to play down here]
;W[lq]C[Aiming to slide under & take the bottom edge territory]
;B[md]C[This is small again- extend the moyo first f17/g17. It's a good idea to have some stones on the 3rd line in the early stages.]
;W[gc];B[jg];W[hg];B[ii];W[hi];B[lp]C[It's usually bad to tenuki (play elsewhere) following a contact play on a single stone like this. j10 is much better, increasing your area & reducing white's.]
;W[mq];B[nq];W[kq]C[Gaining territory & leaving you with weaknesses]
;B[ln]C[This does little to strengthen your position, and invites w to jump & increase his area.]
;W[jn];B[kl];W[ij]C[Now the weakness of the j11 stone is punished]
;B[ji];W[jj];B[kj];W[jl];B[kn]C[This asks white to strengthen his wall. An invasion at c17 is better]
;W[ko];B[lo]C[Try to avoid routinely answering moves like this. Your loss is very small if w plays here instead]
;W[ic];B[id]C[k17 instead loses much less!];W[jc];B[kd]C[why not l17? You have nothing to fear from the cut at l16]
;W[kc];B[lc];W[hd];B[if];W[hf];B[ig];W[mr];B[nr];W[mp];B[mo]
C[This is very small. Invade instead! :-)];W[cq];B[ms]C[Another tiny move, w should ignore it and invade at r17 or defend c17/c16/d17]
;W[ls];B[ns];W[qc];B[pb]C[Should be at r16- block in the direction of your longest extension]
;W[qd];B[pf]C[r15- "hane at the head of two stones!"];W[qf]
;B[pe]C[giving easy life in a very big corner];W[qe];B[qh]C[r13 is safe]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[rj];W[sj];B[sk];W[si];B[rk]
;W[rg]C[You now have sente for an invasion of your own!];B[qb]
;W[rb];B[ra];W[pc];B[oc];W[sc];B[qa]C[This connection is unnecessary, bad shape (empty triangle!) and leaves you short of liberties]
;W[cc];B[he];W[ge];B[ie];W[km];B[lm];W[jm];B[kk];W[kb];B[lb]
;W[la];B[ma];W[ka];B[mb];W[ih];B[jh];W[hh];B[cj]C[A bit late! Contact invasions like these are difficult to use. An open space invasion at c7 or c13 stands more chance of living]
;W[ck];B[bj]C[c11 better. You need eye space! :-)];W[ci];B[bk]
;W[cl];B[bl];W[bm];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[bg]C[a straight- line group on the second line. The rule is 6 die, 8 live, 7 unsettled. This group is only 5 lines long and is dead.]
;B[ah]C[save moves like this for ko threats];W[al];B[sa]C[this move threatens to reduce white's area by one point for a cost of two moves, and also reduces the liberties of you own group!]
;W[sb]C[p18 is now mandatory];B[qj]C[This fills in one point of your own area, and was already safe. "Minus one in gote!!" :-)]
;W[ob];B[oa]C[o16 safer!];W[pa];B[na];W[nc];B[nd];W[od];B[oe]
;W[oc];B[nb]C[minus one in gote! :-)];W[mc];B[ld];W[jk];B[ki]
C[Minus one in gote! :-))];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq]C[s3 kills]
;W[rp];B[qo];W[ro];B[rn];W[sn];B[rm];W[sm];B[sl];W[so];B[pr]
C[s3 kills again! :-0];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[qs]C[s1 kills];W[rs]
;B[qn]C[minus one in gote! :-)))];W[sq]C[minus one in gote! :-)]
;B[ag]C[clamping at b14 gives him more chance to go wrong];W[bf]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[Playing at l3 saves one point ( w must connect at k5.)

You show a lot of promise!  Keep playing and enjoying yourself!]
