C[[REVIEWER\] Summarizing: You have good potential. You didn't play greedily, actually you're too nice with black.

When you give points in exchange for thickness, you should look for ways to attack your opponent to gain enough compensation for it.

Do more life and death problems to improve your reading.

And try to avoid doing empty triangles!

Soon, you are going to be punishing more your opponent's mistakes.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[qf];W[nc];B[rd];W[qc];B[rc]C[[TEMP\] is it good to tenuki here?]

(;W[cn]C[I thought this was the biggest move.];B[bp];W[dj];B[cf]
C[[REVIEWER\] This must be a mistake. Black is]
(;W[ce];B[df];W[fd]C[Wanted to build territory.];B[cl];W[dl]
C[Not sure the best way to counter. Was thinking of building outside influence.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[bn];W[dn];B[bo]
(;W[jd]C[Should I have played somewhere near the marked stones instead?

[REVIEWER\] For sure. Since you have a lot of stones nearby you should avoid letting black linking up so easily.

By attacking the two lonely stones you can profit at the top naturally..]
;B[bi]
(;W[jq];B[jc]LB[nq:B][oq:A]TR[dq]C[[REVIEWER\] Black seems greedy. Enclosing the corner at A or B is huge in term of points and also pushes white's stone against the strong triangle black stone.

You should get sente at the top to come back first to the bottom.]
;W[ic];B[kc];W[kd];B[lc]C[Not sure if there's a better way to handle this kind of invasion, or whether it's worth ceding territory to make moves elsewhere...]
;W[ld];B[mc];W[md];B[nb];W[ob]C[A little greedy, I think.];B[oc]
C[Now I suffer as a result.];W[nd];B[pb]
(;W[mq]LB[oq:A]C[Since Black was focused up top, I returned to the bottom.

[REVIEWER\] This is safe but too small, black can just enclose the corner at A and be satisfied (the corner is bigger and your stones can still be attacked).]
;B[qb]LB[mb:A]C[[REVIEWER\] There is still A. So you see black keeps getting gote here. His invasion was pretty greedy.]
;W[pq]C[Again, since Black didn't respond earlier.

[REVIEWER\] The idea is right but I don't like this move. You are too close to the black stone. In go, usually you don't touch to attack. Probably it just make your opponent stronger.]
;B[qq]
(;W[qr]C[[REVIEWER\] This is too submissive. White is playing at the 2nd line for no reason.]
;B[rr];W[pr];B[rs]
(;W[gq]C[Creating more space.

[REVIEWER\] Your group is already alive. The right side is more open, so go there.]
;B[hq]C[[REVIEWER\] Greedy again.];W[hp];B[iq];W[ip]C[Not sure the best way to handle this kind of invasion. I went for outside influence but barely survived this encounter as you'll see.]
;B[jr]
(;W[hr]C[This was a mistake, I think.

[REVIEWER\]  Yes, it was since if you don't save this stone, black will make an eye by capturing it.]
;B[ir]LB[gr:A]C[[REVIEWER\] Now you have the A cut to defend.]
;W[gr];B[kq];W[jp];B[lq];W[mp];B[mr];W[nr];B[lr];W[ks]C[[REVIEWER\] Good placement. Black shouldn't live here.]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[go]
(;W[fo]C[[REVIEWER\] This move seems to be the problem. It doesn't help the center stones (see variations).]
;B[ho];W[kp];B[lp]
(;W[jn]C[I was not doing so well here.

[REVIEWER\] Unfortunately you can't capture black directly. This running battle is inevitable now.]
;B[mo]
(;W[nq]TR[mp][mq]C[This battle, too, I barely survived.

[REVIEWER\] This seems too submissive and bad shape (empty triangle).]
;B[ko]
(;W[jo]TR[ip][jp]C[[REVIEWER\] This is bad shape (empty triangle) and only connects your stones. Try to do moves that have dual purposes.]
;B[no];W[oo];B[op];W[pp];B[np];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[mm]LB[go:A]
[jo:B][mo:C]C[[REVIEWER\] The A, B and C groups are weak and only one of them is yours. You have the advantage.

Black made a terrible mistake. So just breathe and kill the corner group.]

(;W[hm]C[Shifted focus, but this was too early.];B[ql];W[ro]
;B[rp]C[Trying to be aggressive but Black ended up surviving.]
;W[sp];B[rq];W[rn];B[pn];W[on];B[pm]
(;W[om]C[[REVIEWER\] Again you pushed from the wrong side. During a fight you should reinforce the weaker group (in this case, the right one).]
;B[qm];W[rm]C[[REVIEWER\] Before doing a move like this, count the liberties...]
;B[rl]LB[rl:B][rm:A]C[[REVIEWER\] Your group has three and black's bottom group has four. You lost this capturing race anyway.
The A-B exchange is good for black who renforced the right side. (see variation)]
;W[ol];B[lm];W[oj];B[lk];W[mi];B[jl];W[kn]C[[REVIEWER\] This is a good move (it removed a potencial eye there).]
;B[lo];W[ln]C[[REVIEWER\] But this is a bad exchange...];B[mn]
LB[ln:A][mn:B]C[[REVIEWER\] You lost a liberty and a ko threat for nothing.]
;W[in];B[jj];W[kh];B[hk];W[fl];B[hi];W[fi];B[ki];W[lh];B[li]

(;W[mh]C[[REVIEWER\] This is too soft.];B[mj]
(;W[nj];B[nk];W[ok]LB[nj:A][ok:B]C[[REVIEWER\] White had to play A and B to connect. This was inefficient. (see variation)]
;B[qi];W[ih];B[ii];W[jh];B[ji];W[hh];B[ff]
(;W[hf];B[ge]LB[gd:A][he:B]TR[ff]SQ[fd][hf]C[[REVIEWER\] When you have this formation (a black's kosumi in the middle of a white's elephant ear) playing at A or B is usually bad since you force black to push through.]

(;W[gd]C[[REVIEWER\]  Bad. You're pushing black to your own territory.]
;B[he];W[hd];B[ie]LB[kd:A][kh:B]C[[REVIEWER\] This move painful for white. The A and B stones are making almost no points.]

(;W[id]LB[id:A][mf:B]C[[REVIEWER\] You don't need to connect. (see variation)]
;B[jf]C[Black's push here cost me the game, I think in terms of points.]
;W[kf];B[og]
(;W[ng]LB[cc:A][mf:B]C[[REVIEWER\] This is small. The A area is much bigger than the B area. Also black cannot cut you (see variation).]
;B[oh];W[ni];B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[cd];B[ae];W[ad];B[bg];W[gh]
LB[mb:C][hh:B][fi:A]C[[REVIEWER\] Why this move? The A and B groups are already alive. Remember: connecting living groups is usually small. Cutting at C is the biggest move on the board.]
;B[eh];W[rk]C[[REVIEWER\] This move seems an overplay... (see variation)]

(;B[sm]C[[REVIEWER\] Black didn't punish white.];W[qk];B[so]
