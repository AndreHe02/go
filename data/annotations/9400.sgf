;B[pd];W[po]C[ShadRaouf [2k?\]: hello];B[cd];W[qf]C[ShadRaouf [2k?\]: have a good game]
;B[nd];W[pj];B[dq];W[co];B[cm]C[how good of an idea was this pincer move because of the strength white has on the right?]
;W[dm];B[fp]LB[cl:A]C[Should I have extended at A?

hi  !  please try eidogo.com it's a great site for showing "next moves" in joseki.  of course in any given game, the joseki move may not be right.

In this situation though, yes either extending in to A or thrusting in to c6 or cutting at d6 all look better than abandoning the stone in this position.]
;W[cl];B[cn]LB[ci:A]C[maybe A or playing somewhere else entirely wouldve been better]
;W[dn];B[bo]C[of course this was a lost cause];W[do];B[bp];W[bl]
C[
I suggest saving the 2 black stones.  b7 is ok even though it can be atari'd, because b7 reduces white liberties iming at a cut at d8 and if white protects the cut , black can quietly make profit elsewhere and wait for an opportunity to attack the entire white group.]
;B[cg]C[Playing at top would've been better right? But how would I have handled White getting a big area there?]
;W[dc]LB[gc:B][dd:A]C[ofc A was much better or B];B[cc];W[dd]
;B[de];W[ee];B[df];W[cb];B[gc]LB[ed:B][jd:A]C[How is this move? I meant to create a big area for myself by playing A sometime and also threatening to cut at B

I was wondering about the cut at B instead of D14 but I'm not sure !  It was worth considering.]
;W[bb]C[How to react to this move? I have no idea

it depends on whether your group is alive or not.  if not, then something like c11 makes it safer.  if it is alive, then the e16 cut looks juicy]
;B[kc]C[
might be too far.  maybe k17 instead since you want g17 to e strong for attacking white's entire corner]
;W[ci]C[
now we wish black had played here as mentioned previously];B[pq]
C[I have trouble with approaching these kind of situations. Where white has some territory on one side and there is empty space on the other.


the cut at e16 looks good since white got c11 first.];W[bd]
C[
this situation has gotten dire for black];B[be];W[bc];B[ce]
;W[ic]C[How to react to this


discussed earlier !];B[fd]C[before making this move, decide whether the cut is better !]
;W[ed]C[

cut lost and gone forever];B[he]C[   actually, f14 looked like a nice enclosure move instead of h15]
;W[kd];B[lc];W[ie];B[hd];W[id];B[gf];W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[eh]
;W[fh];B[ei];W[fi]C[
i might have preferred e10 to c12 to aim at attacking white stones on left]
;B[ch]C[black is lucky to live so easily here.  notes said to review for black so i didn't mention how white could have punished.]
;W[hg]C[How to save this group?


The most important point, I think is that black allowed two weak groups to form, this one on top and the one on the left.  Better is to make one of them safe much earlier so that white doesn't get this splitting attack between the two groups]
;B[gg];W[hh];B[ff]C[
maybe e18 for black instead of f14 .  black is under severe attack here.]
;W[eb];B[hb];W[ib];B[fb];W[ga];B[np]C[
if black thinks the upper group is in grave danger, black may want to consider pushing at g12 and cutting at h11, or save it for later.  white could play j11 first and then black is fairly dead on top, unless possibly black gets to play j14 and k14 and set his sights on attacking the upper white stones.  but that might need to wait until black pushes against the white r14 stone first.]
;W[lq];B[iq];W[qq];B[qm]C[instead of black r7, to which white can respond at q4 or p3, black may want to play q4, and then if white answers at r4, black can continue with r2 which threatens both r5 cut and attacking the m3 stone]
;W[pp]C[now it's harder for black.  see comments on previous move please]
;B[oq];W[qr]C[
since this r2 move gives black the nice s5 forcing move, white might want to consider s4 instead of r2]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[lo]C[
since black already has the j3 stone in place, black should evaluate the L3 cut instead of m5.  it requires some reading to decide whether you like it, but it's worth considering]
;W[ip]C[
maybe white k3 is better

in general, try to make the move that doesn't give the opponent a nice followup]
;B[jq]C[this being the nice followup];W[kq];B[hp];W[ko];B[ln]
;W[kn]C[white is cutting black in two (left and right side) which doesn't feel so good for black

what about black L5 instead of H4 , since that attacks white while defending.]
;B[qk]C[
if white answers this at s5, white is almost completely alive in corner so then white can look forward to attacking black's lower stones.  so maybe black should just jump out at p7 instead of r9]
;W[qj];B[pk]C[maybe p6 or p7 instead of q9 , since q9 doesn't attack much]
;W[lm];B[nn];W[ho];B[gp];W[om];B[mm];W[ml];B[ll];W[km];B[nl]
;W[mk];B[nm];W[ej]C[decide whether e10 threatens the group.  if not, then ignore it and attack white instead.  for instance think about s5.  remember, you need something back for the loss up top.]
;B[bi];W[oj];B[rp];W[qn];B[rn];W[ro];B[rm]C[t5 atari looks better, since black wants to attack white so best not to lose the s4 stone unless giving it up can reduce white to a nonliving shape]
;W[so];B[pn];W[qo]
(;B[on]C[always be looking for sente.  if this p6 isn't needed for living here, black should find something else big.  it's not easy to push and cut anymore at g12 since white has now formed a center territory.  black may be lost now.
