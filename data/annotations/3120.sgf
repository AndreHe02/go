C[A: Hi.  I am Andy, your reviewer.  I will preface my remarks with an "A:" so you know it is me commenting.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[id];W[pi];B[cj];W[cg];B[ej]C[I play B9 as I want to threaten W8 and strengthen my area.
Is this move useful and big enough?

A: It is certainly useful and I would say big enough as well. You want to be a little careful because if your center group chases W8 out in a series of one-space jumps, then you may weaken your stones on top.  There are many alternative moves here and some may be better than others, but the thinking behind this one was perfectly sound.]
;W[eh];B[ed];W[fj];B[fk]C[B13 useful?

A: Well, in retrospect useful, but black's stones are still attackable and white's stones get stronger.  I might have done E9 instead, so that E9 is not a cutting point.  Unprotected cutting points allow (good) opponents to vastly complicate your game.]
;W[gj];B[cn];W[dm];B[eo]C[Is B17 too risky?

A: You and white are both attacking and counterattacking somewhat savagely without much regard for the positions from which you are attacking.  As you get better, you will do that less and instead do moves which see to the safety of your positions before doing too much attacking.  In this instance, B17 worked out fine for your, but we can't tell how much of that is because your opponent was not playing well.  I would, in this position, do something like C7.  That is either timid or solid, depending how it works out, but that is what I would do.]
;W[dn];B[co];W[do];B[dp];W[ep];B[dq];W[fo];B[en]C[A: You and white are refusing to make any concessions to each other here.  As a result you both have a large number of tiny, weak groups.  In this case, I would give white the advantage. Review the variation for a sequence of forcing moves that put white in a good position.  The sequence white actually played is so bad that I am forced to my principal conclusion about your go playing:  A good start, but you need better opponents.]

(;W[fn];B[em];W[el];B[fm];W[gm];B[fl]C[A: There is a proverb that a failed ladder costs you seven points a rung.  There is another proverb that if you can't read out a ladder, don't play go.  White has vigorously chased black into a much stronger position.]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[dl];B[dj];W[cq]
(;B[eq]C[As I guess W will connect W22 and W24, so I played B37.

However, did it correct? Is there a danger if W direct attack B15 and B19?

A: White's stones have a shortage of liberties and I can't see how an attack on your two stones would succeed.  It is a good thing to consider, however, and if you are worried, move at C7 and be done with them all.  All your stones are safe here.]

(;W[fp];B[cr]C[Is B39 move correct for attact?

A: I am not sure.];W[bp];B[cm];W[br];B[dr];W[fr];B[fq];W[gq]
;B[gr];W[hr];B[gp];W[gs];B[gn];W[gl];B[gk];W[hn];B[go];W[fp]
;B[ik]C[Is B57 a suitable move? Right time and right place?

A: I think so.  I might have just moved at H9, which accomplishes the same thing, making sure white has no hope of territory in the center, but without giving white a forcing move against you later.  It is one move in the utter collapse of white's position.]
;W[im]
(;B[hk]C[Is B59 needed at this moment?

A: See variation.  Although white did not make much use of the forcing move, he did make you move there.]
;W[fi]C[A:  By the way, the three white stones at F10 form what is called the "empty triangle" shape, which is better avoided when possible. It helps white not at all in this instance.]
;B[hi]C[Did B61 a correct way to attack the White?];W[hj];B[ij]
;W[ii];B[ih]C[Did B65 good or play at x or other better moves?

A:  There is another proverb about not making atari on stones you can't capture.  White here can run away and you have to look to the security of your two separable stones.  I might have opted for H12, which threatens capture of J11 just as much, in a ladder, as well as weakening white's left group and staying connected.]

;W[ho];B[hp];W[ip]
(;B[in]C[I think the shape formed by B93 is not good. But is there a better move?

A: See variation for something, but I don't know if it is better, particularly consider who you are playing with.]

C[Is B103 good? I intend to stop and kill the White at the bottom and extend the Black.

A:  It is fine.  Makes a decent shape and kills the group at the bottom, I think.]
;W[mh];B[nh]C[Is B105 a proper move? Necessary? Or any other move to procted these 5 Black stones is better?]

;W[pm];B[pn]C[White resigned after B127. This is my first game to play online and have a record. Would you have a comment on what is my strength and weakness at the moment? I am new to Go. What is the best way for me to get improvement?

Would you like to tell me what is my strength(kyu) at this moment too?

Thank you very much.

A:  Your current main weakness as a go player is your opposition. Your opponent here was either relatively new to the game or was just playing a quickie.   The trouble with playing players like this one is all you are getting practice in is capturing large groups of stones.  If you play against players not as good as you, it is best to give them a handicap.  You clearly are a beginner, but one who is interested in playing well and improving.  You are thinking in some of the right ways and looking at some of the right things.  Then at least you might have a fight on your hands.  You just need to play more games against better players. My advice would be to play on KGS, where the chat function is pretty good, the players very friendly and it is easy to play handicap games against higher and lower ranked players.  IGS is good too, but sometimes a little daunting and not as good software.  At a guess, I would say you should call yourself 20 kyu, but that is really not that meaningful at this stage.  Play 100 games on KGS, and you will have a meaningful number.  There are also good books for beginners, including "The Second Book of Go," "Life and Death," "In the Beginning," "Tesuji," and a number of others.  They will teach you a lot.

Keep on playing and enjoy!

All the best,

Andy])
