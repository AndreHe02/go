;W[qc];B[kc];W[qj];B[oq]C[Nice opening.  Good standard moves.  ];W[pq]LB[jq:a][rq:b]C[This move is a little questionable.  The kick is an attacking move.  You would normally have a stone around 'a' before using it.  Otherwise you just make black make an ideal extension along the bottom.  

(never mind 'b')];B[op];W[pm]C[Was 14 here OK?  Or was R6 better?

R14 was too far away from your corner.  The Iron Pillar black has at P3 P4 is quite strong and your corner isn't.  

R6 would be right.

Remember, the kick you made at move 12 is usually uses as an attack, not so much a way to secure the corner because the white's corner ends up smaller than black's side.  See variation 2.]
(;B[qo]C[Nice move by black.];W[po];B[pp];W[qn];B[ro];W[rp];B[oo];W[pn];B[qq];W[rq];B[pr];W[kp]LB[co:a][cf:b][fc:c][dj:d]C[I didn't know exactly where to play here.  Is there something
better than 26?

Good question.

The black group in the lower left is very thick, meaning it's not attackable.  Stones you play anywhere near it will immediately come under attack.  Hence the important concept:  Stay away from thickness.  Your move violates this concept.  Perhaps you are trying to keep black from making profit next to his wall, but he will attack you from the left and make profit over on the lower left side of the board while at the same time keeping your stone(s) weak.

A play around one of the marked points would have been better.  Of all of them, I think 'a' is best because it follows the natural order of openings which is:  Play in the corners first, then sides, then the center.  Preventing black from completeing the corner enclosure should be a high priority.

;B[ip]C[Excellent attacking move by black.];W[kn];B[rr]C[Good, settles the corner in sente.];W[rn];B[lo]C[Black really should be attacking from the other side and taking easy profit on the left.  Now black is violating "stay away from thickness."  It applies to both your own and your opponents.];W[ko];B[mn];W[im]C[Here I was debating between J7, J6, and L8.  What would you have recommended?

They are all pretty similar.  You have a weak, attackable group in the center, but it's not in immediate danger.  Your move 34 just doesn't do very much to help.  Black would need 3 unanswered moves to enclose this group even losely.  I would again have preferred to play around d5 and set up a base along the edge.  It will give you some profit and secure bases  on both sides to run your weak group toward if necessary.];B[jq]C[Black is securing substantial profit.];W[co]C[Good.]
;B[cp]LB[ep:a][cm:b][dm:c][dl:d][ck:e]C[This kick again is kind of odd.  It just settles all of white's  weak groups in an ideal way.  Remember, contact plays settle both (black and white) groups.  Black would prefer to setlle himself and keep white weak.   More usual moves are marked.

I like 'a' best as it threatens to split the two weak groups while taking profit.];W[do];B[fq];W[dk]C[This is a good result for white given where he was a few moves ago.  Black's thickness in the lower left is basically neutralized now and white has no weak groups.
];B[dm];W[cm]C[Was 42 correct?

Yes, you connect your three stones and settle your group securely.

If your move 40 had been played at C9, I don't think black could successfully invade.  Extensions from walls, which is what your move 40 is, are generally made on the third line when you are seeking to secure the area in front of the wall.

See variation 2 for the invasion vs. 3rd line extension.]
(;B[cl];W[dl];B[cn];W[bm];B[dn];W[bn];B[eo];W[fm]C[Was white B4 better here?  Yes, this move was a mistake.

B5 looks even better.  If he doesn't answer B5, you can jump into his corner.  If he does, you get to play your move at F7 and it does more for you.  Plus it saves you having to defend at C9 later.

See variation 2.

(;B[bo];W[bp];B[ao];W[em];B[dp];W[ck];B[dg];W[dh]C[Contact plays like this start an immediate fight and settle both sides.  Your stones on the left are already secure enough, so all this does is give black the entire top left corner.];B[eh];W[ei];B[ch];W[di];B[eg]
;W[ci];B[bh];W[bi]C[White got about 4 points of profit out of contacting black's stone at D12.  Look what black got.];B[cg];W[cc]LB[fc:a][eb:b][ne:c][he:d]C[Where should I have invaded at the top?

I have to confess that invasions aren't my strongest point.  Even so, I can say this:

It's going to be difficult since black is so strong on both sides.  Any invading stone will come under a very strong attack.
  
In response to your invasion at move 68, black should have blocked the 3-3 invasion on the other side.  See variation 2.  The rule is block on the side that is bigger.

'a' and 'b' look possible.  'c' looks big as it is the expansion point of both moyo's.  I think I would have played there first.

Next I would probably play a reducing move around 'd' (depending on where black played.  A reducing move like this limits the growth of a moyo without becoming the subject of such a difficult attack.  Furthermore, reducing moves generally end in sente while invasions end in gote.]
(;B[cd]C[Wasn't black 69 better placed at D17?

Yes.  For sure.  ];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[fc];B[ed];W[gb]C[Was white 74 and 76 correct or should I have played something else?

It was correct.  This is a joseki variation where black gets to trade the corner for giving white a ponuki in the middle.  Actually, I think this was a really poor choice for black.  A ponnuki is supposed to be worth about 30 points here as it gives white easy life right in the middle of black's moyo.];B[db];W[fa];B[cb];W[ic]
;B[jb];W[ib];B[fd];W[gd];B[ge];W[hd];B[he]C[At this moment who do you think is better?

Looks like black is ahead by about 20 points.  To come to this I made some assumptions about where the territory along the edges will be bounded and counted up the points.  

Black has a slightly weak group on top that white could press to squeeze some extra points out of.  Both sides should be interested in playing R18 soon as it secures quite a bit of profit and affects the stability of the black group significantly.

It will be hard for either player to make any big profit in the center since both players have many ways to access and destroy any territory there, so I just called that zero.

;W[kf];B[jf];W[lf];B[je];W[ml]LB[lm:a]C[Was white 98 the best method of holding black into the bottom?

It's pretty good.  You are threatening to take substantial territory along the right.  

Your stone 98 does not link to the stone at L6 because black can play at 'a', but I think it's unreasonable to try to keep black entirely out of the center. ];B[nm]C[Black actually helped you with this move.

];W[nl];B[lm];W[km];B[ll];W[lj]C[104 would have been better placed at M9, right?

I think it's fine where you put it.]
;B[kk];W[kj];B[jk];W[jj]C[This move doesn't do anything, and you've been weakening your stones in the lower center by pushing black along here.  Time to look after them.];B[ik];W[gl]C[I probably should have played 110 at H7 or is there a better
place?

Your move works fine as shown later.

H7 works.  See variation 2.

I think H6 works too, but I don't see any real advantage to it.  See variation 3.
