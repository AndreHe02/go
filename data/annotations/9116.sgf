AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,  I played Black in a two-stone
handicap game.

I've included a number of specific questions, and also some explanations of what I was trying to accomplish.  I would be grateful to see where I missed urgent moves, played small moves when big ones were available, or whatever corrections you feel should be made.

Thank you!

----------------------------------

Hi Fred,

I'll try my best to get you a useful review :)];W[cc];B[pp]
;W[nc];B[pf]C[Played B4 instead of pincer since
right side seemed a bigger area to play in.];W[jd];B[df]LB[qj:a]
C[To prevent a W double wing. Or should I have played at A (or nearby) immediately?

----------------------

Playing at A would be considered slow right now. You played on the left side which is clearly the biggest area on the board right now. It was a good sense of direction.]
;W[fd]
(;B[cj]LB[di:B][dj:a]C[Played low for "balance".  But then  it looked dumb. Should it have been at A?  Or an earlier move was bad?

-----------------------------

Playing I personally would have played this move at B.
The reason for this is that it doesn't leave the weakness of the 3 space extension.

In handicap games, you have the advantage of having more black stones on the board. The reasoning behind this is that you have a stronger fighting position.

To illustrate this, please look at the variation.

This move is not a bad move though!];W[qh]C[Ouch!];B[qj]C[This is the correct way to attack the stone! Very good.]
;W[oh]
(;B[nd]C[Should B12 be elsewhere?

----------------------

Attaching to the white stone makes white stronger and black heavier. A better shape move would be at A, please see variation.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[pk]C[Black has a heavy shape and white secured points at the top in sente.]
;B[qk];W[pl];B[pj];W[oj];B[ql];W[oi]TR[pc][nd][pd][ne][pf]C[The marked group looks a bit lonely between two solid W positions..]

(;B[pn]LB[qn:a]C[Was this too risky instead of A?

----------

There are at least 2 better moves here, please see variations.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[qp]C[Make sure the B side group has a base...]
;W[rr];B[rq];W[qr]
(;B[iq]C[Too defensive?

----------

Too small, yes.];W[cn];B[co]C[The kick is a good choice here, white can't make a good shape.]
;W[dn];B[fp];W[dl];B[ej];W[gm];B[gk]C[Trying to chase W, but ultimately he seems to connect to the right,
not sure what I got in return.];W[cq]
(;B[bo]C[I separate W into two weak groups (I hope!)];W[dr]
;B[eq]LB[fr:a]C[I wasn't sure how to respond to W45.
For instance, If B46 at A, then I worry about the poke of W47 at the present B46.]
;W[br];B[er];W[cs]C[Could B have killed the corner?]
(;B[im]LB[hl:A]C[This shape leaves a weakness at A];W[hl]TR[mi]
[jj][kj][lj][ik][mk]C[White is being pushed away from black's influence and into his own weak group.
This also helps black to run towards his wall on the right.]
;B[ij]LB[jk:a]C[Is B52 OK? I guess B52 at A might have made it harder for him to connect to the right side?]
;W[il];B[jm];W[jl];B[kl]C[Bad hane?];W[jj];B[ii]LB[fh:a]C[Hoping to get some territory around A, but

--------------------

A cannot get any territory! You shouldn't even consider it.]
;W[kk];B[ll];W[ff]C[He got there first!];B[eh]C[Black is in a bit of trouble and is forced to play some small moves.]
;W[gh];B[gi]C[Just staying connected...];W[no]
(;B[lo]C[So B has lost the initiative...

---------------

too small!];W[go];B[io]C[way too small!

It looks like black is playing scared after white escaped and started to counter attack.
Black lost the game in terms of fighting spirit already.];W[mj]
C[W has reduced B and also connected the chased group to safety. Was there a particular B
mistake, or is this a reasonable outcome?];B[hc]C[Time for B to invade W, I thought.
Too reckless? I thought (or hoped!)
B could either live or run, W's upper side greatly reduced.]
;W[gc];B[he];W[ie]TR[hc]C[I never anticipated W73 -- so now it looks like I have to abandon the marked stone.]
;B[hf];W[hd];B[gg];W[rf];B[qe]TR[eq]C[I didn't really know how to respond
-- felt similar to my marked stone in lower left.];W[sc]C[A kibbitzer later said that W79 was an overplay, but I don't see the refutation.]
;B[rc];W[se];B[rd];W[sd];B[pb]C[Try to live, and threaten his territory.]
;W[ob];B[ld]C[No longer sure what I had in mind here.];W[me]
;B[lc];W[mc];B[ki]C[Here I wanted to create a place for the upper right B group to run to, by threatening to cut off W's lower left side group.]
;W[kj];B[if];W[jf];B[ke]TR[ob][mc][nc][oc][md][me]SQ[lc][ld]
C[Here I had hopes of chasing (if not capturing) the triangle stones,
simultaneously running to safety with the square stones, greatly
reducing W's top side.];W[je];B[kf];W[mf];B[nf]C[But somehow I thought I had to answer to keep the upper corner B group alive,
so..];W[kg]C[so B's running stones get captured.];B[lg];W[lf]
;B[mg]C[Still trying to get a little aji against W's stones, just in case.]
;W[kd];B[bl];W[bf]LB[be:a]C[I guess a move like B104 at A would have been bigger than the actual
B104.];B[bg];W[cf];B[cg];W[de];B[ef];W[ee];B[af];W[be];B[mr]
;W[nr];B[ae];W[ad];B[ag];W[bd];B[nn]LB[rp:a]C[Maybe A instead?]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[ok]C[I guess I'm wasting sente on capturing junk stones.]
;W[nk];B[ol];W[nl];B[om];W[ji];B[kh];W[le];B[jh]C[W's big central group has suddenly become vulnerable -- any eyes?

(B104 and B120 seem to have contributed to weakening W's group, after all.)]
;W[ng];B[og];W[nh];B[mi];W[mh];B[lh];W[od]C[But now I got worried that my upper right corner group could be captured.]
;B[re]LB[oh:a][ph:b]C[If the next few moves are hard to understand -- it may look like he should have been able to hold me down to one eye -- actually sometime during the previous few moves the stone at A had gotten displaced to B and no one realized that it should really be at A  (until I looked at the game record at home, later.)  My opponent has extremely poor eyesight and has to lean way over the board to look closely, and the edge of his shirt probably touched a stone, five(?) moves earlier.
Sorry!
With A  displaced to B, Black has a cut at A and some White stones
could potentially be cut off and captured, saving B's corner group
and *really* endangering W's central group  (I think).  But B was slow to notice this during the game.]
;W[oe];B[sb]C[B did not grasp what was at stake and was simply happy to make two eyes.]
;W[of]C[So W is all connected and B missed the chance!];B[sf]
