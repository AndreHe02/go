C[Hi, my name is Tomáš and I will review your game. I am only around 3k on KGS, so do not take everything I say for granted.

I will be reviewing mainly for black, as you asked me to.];B[pd]

[nq:A]C[I do not like this move very much. Fourth line stones are usually used for influence, but with the 3-3 stone in the top-left corner, white cannot put that much pressure on black, if black decides to invade the area around C14.

I think that any of A-F would be better.];B[fq];W[hq];B[cq]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep]
(;B[jd]C[I think you should finish the joseki in lower left corner first. See variations.]

(;W[dm]LB[hd:C][qf:B][fj:D][nq:A]TR[cp][dp][ep]C[This is very defensive. White has some influence from the tringled stones, so he can play something like D, let black come in and attack him.

But black is getting a lot of influence, so reducing it with any of A-C would be better than trying to out-influence him with D.

But before that, there is the unfinished joseki in the lower-left corner. White should take advantage of this (see variations).]

(;B[jj]C[Black is taking a lot of influence, but does not have any territory yet. I would play something more territorialy inclined, while also trying to reduce white. See variations.]
;W[nq];B[qn]
(;W[kp];B[fc];W[pg]
(;B[qh]C[I would defend from the other side, to keep white from easy life in the corner.]

(;W[qg]C[This is heavy.]
(;B[mc]C[What is black trying to accomplish here?

White has a weak group, black should keep pressure on it. Keep it unsetled. Either kill it, or build territory by chasing it out. White has can try to build a base by attaking the corner. Black should prevent that.]

(;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]
(;W[rd]TR[pg][qg]C[I think this is a mistake, but i'm not sure how to punish it with the two marked stones in place.

I think this is OK for white.];B[re]

(;W[ob];B[nb]
(;W[pb]C[This is a mistake.]
(;B[nd]C[This is a strange shape. If black wants to connect, P16 is better, because it prevents the peep at P15.

But black does not need to connect and he can kill white instead (see variation).]
;W[rb]
(;B[rg]C[Why not prevent white from escaping instead?];W[ph]
;B[qi];W[nh];B[nj]C[i thought i could keep white from living here.]

;W[lo];B[ln];W[kn];B[lm];W[km];B[ll]LB[kl:A]C[is capping at A too risky?

I thing that turning at A would be OK. But it's only worth a few points and black seems to be ahead, so playing it safe is also good.]

;W[tt]C[To sumarise:

For futher improvement, you migth like to study some life and death problems. Both white corners on the right side could have been killed. 
You should always look for the urgent moves first. In this game, both players ignored the lower left corner for a long time. White could have made a substancial profit there. Black should have prevented that.
When you don't see any urgent move, try to find the big point. In this game, black could have reduced the upper left, if he played there before white did.

Good luck and have fun playing go!])
