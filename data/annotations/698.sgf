;VW[]B[pp]C[Game reviewed by Richard Rumley  (rumley@netcom.com)
October 7, 1998
AGA rank 5 kyu];W[qd];B[dq];W[cp]C[Seems to me that White should play in the  upper left corner.
Since W plays here, now Black should take the UL corner instead.]
;B[dp]C[This  move is wrong because of the following:
  Too early to make contact play
  You are pushing white from behind

If black feels that he should move in this corner (which I don't
think black does) then play AWAY from white, in the area of G4,
E4, or something like that.

I still say that a move in the UL corner is better.];W[cq]C[This is in  the wrong direction.  White should play at C5 instead.   When pushed from behind, always extend.]
;B[co]C[This is why White should have played here.  Good move by black]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cr]C[This move is better at C7.  Since white is  crawling on the second line, black should
allow white to do that all day long!!!!  Now, white can turn the corner at C7  and get
back into the middle.  That would be bad for black

Again, when pushed from behind, continue to extend.];W[cm];B[dm]
;W[br];B[ds]C[I don't understand this move.  If you are worried  about the D2 cut, then either play
at D2 or at E2.  If you can help it, never play on the 1st line during an  opening.]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[dd]C[White gets to move in this corner anyway.

Black's wall in the lower left seems weak to me, with several spots to
peek.  W can play E6, E5, and E2 to take away any Moyo.

White seems ahead.];B[jd]C[Hard to say where the best move is at this point.  There is nothing  wrong with Black's
move, but I would probably play somewhere around K4 or even M4.  Somewhere  around
there.];W[jq]C[I guess white read my mind!];B[mq]C[Black has the correct idea.  Force white into black's wall.]
;W[gq];B[go]C[I'm not sure what this move accomplishes.  It doesn't really  seal white in,
it doesn't make territory, and it doesn't make black strong.

A better move would be somewhere around N5, or even K5.  A play at K5 would
kinda force white to live near the black wall.];W[ho]C[good move by white.  It makes nice shape, and is a contact play.   Always make
contract plays when you are weak and your oppt is strong.];B[hn]
C[For some reason, I like the extension to G6 better than the hane of  H6.  Probably a
matter of taste, rather than right or wrong.];W[io];B[gp]C[Good.  Force W into a bad shape]
;W[hp];B[pj]C[This is a big move.  Howver, there are still cutting points on  the black group.

Remember the order of play

1.  Where an I weak
2.  Where is my opponent weak
3.  Where is the big point.

I can answer #1.  A move around F6 would fix up blacks weaknesses.
Also, the move f3 would be sente.  (rule #2)
So, there are better moves than taking the big point.];W[od]
C[Nice reply by white.];B[mc]C[A professional once told me that during the opening, play where  there is the biggest space.
There are 4 spaces to the right of K16, and 5 spaces to the left.  It makes  sence to me to
play towards the left side, maybe at F17.];W[pg]C[Nice shape by white]
;B[qh]C[Again, the Q10 stone isn't in any danger, and this move is a one  point extension.
The upper side is bigger, and the left side is biggest.];W[ph]
;B[pi];W[gc];B[hc]C[A contact play is pretty harsh here.  The stones  aren't in any danger, try the left side.]
;W[gd];B[cc]C[3,3 is good point.  The left side might get very large if  white gets a big wall here.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[da]C[Hmmm.... I don't know joseki, but the  cut at E17 looks awful tempting to me!
By cutting at E17, your plays at B16 will be stronger.];W[bb]
;B[bc];W[bd];B[ab];W[cb];B[ba];W[hb];B[ib]C[extending to j17 is better than losing the h17 stone]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[ie];W[hd];B[ja]C[Again, black should make the  connection at L18 instead of on the 1st line.

But, remeber that if W wants to take the J18 stone, it will be in gote, so  play
elsewhere!];W[je];B[jf]C[This seems to be in the wrong direction.  The left side is  getting huge for white. but this
atari hurts the K17 string of black stones.  Maybe its best to just leave the  atari alone,
and place elsewhere?  hard to say.];W[ke];B[if];W[md];B[lc]
;W[ld];B[oc];W[kc];B[kb];W[kd];B[jb]C[Does B need to  connect here?  Black isn't going to kill either string of white stones, it
might be more beneficial for black to play around R18];W[pc]
;B[ob];W[pb];B[nd];W[ne];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[oe];B[ck]C[Good move by  black]
;W[dj];B[dk];W[cj];B[bl]C[Sometimes, simply extending to B9 is better than  the atari.  if B B9, white has to answer,
or else white will loose the C7 and C8 stones.  Plus it gives Black sente]
;W[bm];B[bj];W[bi];B[ci];W[ch];B[ai]C[Black should extend and nput the two  stones C10 and D10 into atari.  By letting white
capture C11, white gets very strong, and the black J14 stones are getting  weak.]
;W[di];B[bh];W[bg];B[ci];W[oa];B[na];W[bi]C[I don't see this ko as being  worth very much.  Black should play around the center point
to help out the K14 stones, and white should play around J6 to help his group.]

;B[bf];W[er];B[dr];W[fr];B[pm];W[qq];B[pq]C[I would have blocked the other way, at  R4.  That way, the N3 stone will help you out
with the joseki.];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[rm];W[pr]
;B[or];W[rr];B[ec]C[Atari at Q1 is  also a good sente move.]

;B[no];W[mo];B[mp];W[lo];B[ko];W[lp];B[kr]C[If  B continues down at L4, it might cut off the lower middle group, and have  problems making eyes.
