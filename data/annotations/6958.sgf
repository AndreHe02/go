C[Hi,

My name is peter.
I am a local 1k.
This game was played at a local tournament in Germany.
I played black in this game.
I felt quit good during the game but lost by resignation when I lost one of my groups.

I added some questions that came up during the game.
I hope you enjoy the game and have fun.

Thanks in advance,
Peter

[kb\]: Hi Peter, this is Kyle Blocher, Chinese 3d (AGA 4d).  Looks like you played a good game against your opponent.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[qp];W[dc];B[eq];W[iq];B[cq];W[bq];B[dp];W[co]
;B[cr];W[dm];B[nq]C[[kb\]: So far, so good.];W[qj]C[I didn't want to play L3 because after white G3 black B2 would by gote or after running into the center would have no value.
I thought about R8 too, but after white R13 R6 is open and the upper right corner may be invaded.
So I played C12.];B[ch]C[[kb\]: This looks like a good choice to me, although Black can play on the right side as well.]
;W[cj];B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[ed];B[jc]C[This move is the right direction, though you could play more aggressively and play at J17.]

(;W[lq]C[[kb\]: This move is a mistake by White.  It's better to extend towards the enclosure at R7.]
;B[ql]C[Good];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd]
(;B[qc]C[He had to add a stone atR12/13 now, so I liked this.

[kb\]: I would have rather invaded.  The shape is too comfortable for White after you defend here, and you have a chance to put your enclosure at the bottom to more work.]
;W[ph]
(;B[no]C[[kb\]: This move looks a little awkward.  Reinforcing at P4 is better if you're going to play here.]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[hc]C[Largest place on the board, though the invasion still remains.]

(;B[hd]C[I didn't like K15 because H15 would take some pessure on my left side group.

[kb\]: This is a bad move - you're fixing White's weaknesses.  It's better just to tenuki or play K15.  See the variation on move 32 to see why.]
;W[gc];B[je]TR[hd][gc]C[[kb\]: It's quite clear that the marked exchange did not help Black.]
;W[eh]
(;B[bd];W[bc];B[ee];W[lo]C[This tenuki is bad timing.];B[dd]
;W[cc];B[fd];W[ec]C[Now the weak group is nearly connected.

[kb\]: Yes, in sente.  White's move at E12 is looking wasted.]
;B[pi]C[I decided that invading there would be unreasonable so I tried to build a moyo.]
;W[qi];B[pg];W[qh];B[pf];W[qe]
(;B[ro]C[At this point I counted both players nearly equal but evaluated my prodpects on th upper side better.

[kb\]: Why tenuki now?  You can finish with P12, forcing your opponent to try and come in, and then you'll probably get to play S5 anyway.]
;W[nf]C[Now I didn't want to play Q15 becaus of white O12. I thought long about O13 and if white cuts at Q15 N14. But I feared M14 and the situation is unclear to me.

[kb\]: That's because of your tenuki at the bottom.];B[di]C[[kb\]: Good, getting to play here is large.]
;W[fj];B[dj];W[ck]TR[eh][fj]C[Now I can cut thru F11 which will give me another 10 points. But this is too early now.

[kb\]: Correct.  White's marked moves look like attacking moves, but there's nothing to attack here.]
N[`];B[gq]C[Securing my the group and preparing to develop into the center.

[kb\]: Good.];W[kd]C[But he ignored this.];B[kc]C[[kb\]: Connecting is probably better, but this is a calm response.]
;W[ld];B[lc];W[lf]C[[kb\]: Now your moyo is gone.  In fact, if White cuts your stones at Q13 then White can get a moyo.]
;B[ng]C[As hat has added some stones there I decided not to allow the connection to the right side group.]
;W[mg];B[pe]
(;W[nr]CR[lo][ro]TR[fj][eh][mg][nf][lf][ld][kd]C[[kb\]: This move is smaller because of the presence of the circled moves.  White should be trying to develop central influence to turn the top marked stones into territory.]
;B[or];W[mr];B[nh]C[[kb\]: Correct direction.];W[li];B[kg]C[[kb\]: Good way to expose the shape.]
;W[lg];B[kh];W[pl]C[If I answer, the cut at P13 is severe.]
;B[oh]C[[kb\]: This move is more sente than his, so you get the privilege.  Good.]
;W[mi];B[pm];W[ol]C[[kb\]: Pulling back for White is better.]
;B[qk];W[ij]C[[kb\]: This move looks somewhat necessary, but meaningless.  Better to start the endgame with S17 first, then B2.]
;B[dn];W[en];B[do];W[cn];B[dl];W[cm];B[dk]C[Too quick. I misread this as sente...

[kb\]: It's still a large move.];W[ho]C[Suddenly his center moyo became a threat.]
;B[fl];W[gl];B[gm];W[hm];B[gk];W[hl];B[gj];W[gi]C[[kb\]: White can't have everything...]

[dg:26][rn:21]C[I thought this woulf be enough to win. But it is very difficult for me to count accuratly enough.

[kb\]: Then let's count accurately.

As I count it:

Black: 59
- 15 (top)
- 26 (left)
- 7 (bottom left)
- 21 (bottom right)

White: 48.5 + X
- 13 (top left)
- 8 (right)
- 9 (bottom)
- 11 (left)
- 7.5 (komi)
- X (center)

So Black needs to limit the center to 10 points.];W[ii];B[hh]
;W[ih]C[[kb\]: This move is a mistake - it's very small.];B[mm]
;W[hg];B[gg];W[mn];B[nm];W[lm];B[pj]C[White did not see that this is sente against the right.]
;W[om];B[qg];W[rg]
(;B[rh]C[I decided this side because I evaluated the corner bigger than the side. Now I think this is not true.

[kb\]: Agreed, because the center isn't settled.];W[ri];B[rf]
;W[sh];B[re];W[pk];B[pn]C[[kb\]: A mistake - defending at R7 is better.]
;W[rk];B[rl];W[nn];B[sk]C[A mistake. O10 seems better];W[oi]
;B[oj];W[ni];B[on];W[nj]C[I counted roughly now. I think this is nearly equal on the board. But I have defects now at B15, T15 and Q2, so I decided to try a little.]
;B[mo];W[ln];B[kp];W[mq];B[ip];W[hp];B[hq];W[ir];B[jq];W[jr]
;B[hn];W[in];B[gn]
(;W[go]C[[kb\]: This move is very bad and allows you to get so much.]

;B[ji];W[if];B[hf];W[ig]C[[kb\]: See variation to capture.]

(;B[jf];W[gf];B[ff];W[he];B[gd];W[fg]C[Seeing this I gave up after some moves.

[kb\]: Yes, this is the end.  Well played though.])
(;B[he]C[[kb\]: White cannot capture your stones now.];W[jf]
;B[kf];W[ke];B[ie]))
(;W[io];B[hk];W[ik]))
(;B[rf]C[[kb\]: I agree that this is a bigger move, because the center isn't settled yet.]

(;W[rh];B[re];W[rk];B[rl])))
(;W[og];B[nh];W[oh];B[of];W[mi]C[[kb\]: I think it's very important for White to deny Black's access to the center here.  O6 would then look very tempting.]
))
(;B[oh]SQ[kf][lg][mh][nh][kd][ld][md][oe]C[[kb\]: This move surrounds at least 11 points of influence (expect 5.5+ territory), plus aims at two move moves that can expand your moyo very rapidly...]
;AB[di][ji]SQ[fi][ei][gi][hi][ii][ki][li][mi][ni][ng][mf][lf]
[ke][dg][df][dh][fe][ge][he][ie]C[[kb\]: Two move moves for 27 points of influence seems very large.]
))
(;B[bj]C[[kb\]: I think you should test White's attachment to E12 first.]

(;W[bi];B[ci];W[bk];B[dj];W[ck];B[bh];W[aj];B[ei])
(;W[bk];B[bi];W[ck];B[bd];W[bc]C[Now your group is alive, and you can tenuki to play G3 (the next largest point).]
)))
(;B[je];W[tt];B[cb];W[bd];B[fc]))
(;B[fc]C[This move is also very large.])
(;B[op];W[qn];B[pm]TR[op]C[This stone works to quell the invasion.]
))
(;B[qh];W[qc];B[pi]TR[jc][qc]C[White jumping into the corner push you towards the left, where you want to go anyway (F17 is a huge move).]
))
(;W[qm];B[kq];W[br];B[gq];W[hq];B[gp];W[io]TR[hq][gp]C[[kb\]: For White I would like something like this, possibly omitting the marked exchange (I would play it to make sure the groups stay disconnected)]
