(;B[np]L[oq]C[This move is playable, but there is a conflict of  strategies.  The san-ren-sei opening calls for building a large structure,
inviting your opponent to invade, and attacking it during his invasion to  make some profit.  The attach and extend joseki puts focus
on territories.

The ususal sequence is to attack the kakari stone by playing 'a'.  Please see  variation B.]
