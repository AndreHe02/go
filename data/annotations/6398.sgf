C[Dear reviewer,

  I felt outplayed in this game; looks like Black is dan strength though.

O.M. ("liberaji")

Well, I guess he is more like a strong 2 kyu, still lack the killer's instinct though...]

I would say it's either A or B.

White C or D is not favourable.]

Guess not, you should consider pincer around A and make jumps into the center.

Pls note that the corner is alive, so O3 is not threatening and not worth a move which is say about 15-20 points.]

C[OM: I felt ok at this point, since B's positions are still invadable

Yes, you are correct, A is a good place to invade.

Perhaps before D15, black should play B to E to protect A in sente...]

(;W[ed]LB[fd:A]C[OM: which joseki here?

Keima at A is OK, pls look at the variation.];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd]
;W[ee];B[df]C[Pls look at the variation.]
(;W[om]LB[dh:A][bb:B]C[Black should not tenuki and you can  play A here.

P7 should play at B instead, black has to extend or else white play A.]
;B[pl];W[ek]LB[jn:A][jp:B][jl:C]C[I think white A better.

Black can play A, with B as next move if white choose to cap at C, not quite killable group.]
;B[dl];W[ph]LB[el:A]C[Here, A is a must, it is a very crucial shape move.]
;B[mk];W[qb]LB[nh:A]C[OM: I hoped to press the corner group a little bit but B sealed the invasion in. Any better plan for W?

Jump out at A, not much of a choice here.];B[og]C[Now it is like black played P13 and M9..

You invade at Q12, black tenuki and still your turn...

Something doesn't seem right?];W[oj]LB[mh:A][oh:B][mf:C]C[Pointless to play such moves, chances of success  is way too low..

You should cut loss, play A to reduce, black B and you play C to expand the moyo on top.]

C[OM: Actually I was somewhat relieved to find life here

The fact is, even if you are alive, this is a bad result for white, you created a losing situation.

Black got a very nice wall outside as compensation.];B[op]LB[np:A]
C[Here, white A is possible, give up 4 or 5 stones and solidify the left side.]

C[Black should play A.];B[lp];W[ko];B[mq];W[kl]C[OM: I gave up a lot here

On the contrary, I would Black didn't get much here (only about 10 pts).]
;B[el]LB[fl:A]C[One thing to clarify, because white can't get a favourable position if he choose to block at A...

So to avoid all this, playing E8 at the very first chance is a must.]
;W[fm]LB[fl:A]C[Black should play A.

E9 become a junk stone, which is sad for white.];B[di]LB[fl:A]
C[White A (F8) too big.]
(;W[bb]C[This is an endgame move...

Even if black play B18, white can tenuki.];B[jd]C[OM: another surprise. Does it mean B18 was wrong? How does W answer this?]

(;W[le]C[Well, there isn't a cut here, because black can easily make 2 eyes.

Pls see the variation.]
(;B[lf];W[me];B[mf];W[ke]LB[he:A]C[In actual fact, this is bad for black. 

Playing dame at N14 instead of trying to make 2 eyes...

And K16 look isolated.

Black should play A.];B[if]C[White missed a chance here.

Pls look at the variation.]

Yes, good chance to resign for white here.];W[fl]C[I guess I should end the review here.

Even if you get this good point (F8, actually better if played early), the boundares are more or less fixed, you can't probably get good chances to reverse the game.

I hope you enjoy this review.
