C[Hi! Just looking to review my moves and see what I can do to improve. I am a moyo player and am currently studying how to play for a moyo as white. Any and all comments are appreciated! Thank you
-- Brandon

NR: Hello Brandon. My comments are preceded by my initials (NR). I hope my comments will help you to improve your moves/game. I hope you enjoy this review.

Overall comments
-------------------------
You did a good job in building a territory, though I would recommend that you select moves that are more active. The game was overall peaceful, with not much fighting, yet the biggest enjoyment of Go is perhaps to fight, or at least to threaten to fight and build territory on the way.

I also recommend that you study sanrensei fuseki (see later) in order to enjoy the moyo game that you are currently studying. Games of Takemiya Masaki can be exciting for you to study :)]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]TR[dj]C[NR: If you like moyo games, perhaps you can study sanrensei fuseki. Take a look at http://senseis.xmp.net/?SanrenSei.]

(;W[op]TR[qj]C[NR: I am not sure if this move helps you at all. It is not building moyo, it is not really attacking black, it is not making any of your stones stronger. I am sure you could benefit from playing in a different area, e.g. R10, where you could claim some territory.

It seems to me that R10 is the most open area on the board at this time.]
;B[ql]C[NR: And of course, black plays near that area as well.]
;W[pn]TR[op][jq][mq]C[NR: I understand you are trying to build moyo using your marked stones, though I would say that Q6 is not very effective. In general, it is not adviseable to play moves just trying to "make territory". Usually Go is more enjoyable and played at a higher level when it is more "active" as opposed to passive. Moyo is great! And you can build moyo by active play too.

You could argue that black would respond at R6 of course. Which makes the move at Q6 a bit active. OK.]

C[NR: Black also makes the mistake of playing and then leaving the stones unhelped. See variations for what black could have tried/built.]

(;B[hm];W[im];B[fo];W[ep];B[ie]TR[ig]C[NR: By playing J13 you put more pressure on the two black stones below, and you also support your aim of building the moyo in the center. I would prefer this move instead of K14. K14 helps black solidify his position, thus I consider it an inferior move. Not a favorable exchange for white at this time.]
;W[jf];B[je]
(;W[gi]TR[jf][ig]C[NR: In continuation of my previous comment, it would seem that the two black stones still have aji.I would prefer the stone at K14 to be at J13.

;B[pg];W[qi];B[ri];W[hf]TR[jf]C[NR: This move became necessary after all, so you played 2 moves, to achieve something that could be done with 1 move (i.e. J13).]
;B[fd];W[ge]TR[gd][hd][hf]C[NR: Here is an example of what happens when you don't solidify your stones when you should. And to illustrate this, note the marked stones/points. It is the shape I had suggested earlier on, when I discussed strengthening your stones. (see move 43).]
;B[nr]TR[mr]C[NR: In consistency with your moyo strategy, I would block the black move at N2.]

;W[ei];B[dl];W[dk];B[dm];W[dj];B[fm];W[bb];B[oi]C[NR: Earlier on, I discussed O10. If it was at P11 instead, then the escape of the black stone would be more difficult. Some points were potentially missed here.]
;W[ni];B[oh];W[br];B[mh];W[mi];B[ar];W[ns];B[pr];W[bs]C[NR: Another option here is to capture the black stone at C1.]

;B[po]C[NR: I would advise you to connect this stone and make a strong position. Disaster could develop in situations like this, when seemingly harmless moves are ignored. (See a bit later.) Also see variation from what I would have liked to see as a response here.]

(;W[dc];B[eb];W[hd]C[NR: What if black chose to ignore this move? See variation.

It could be that the moyo you built with so much care would be damaged, just because of a very small move like H16. I would describe it as an end game move, which was played way too early.]

(;B[hc];W[id];B[jd];W[nh];B[ng];W[on]C[NR: Good that you played this move eventually.]

(;W[hd]C[NR: Perhaps it's a good idea to strengthen this stone. There are some "standard" moves that you can benefit from. I was told many times that it's important to finish a play in one area and then move on. Here you played one move, (G16), which was attacked by black but you left it alone. It would seem more appropriate to support it a bit first.]
