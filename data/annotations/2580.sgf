C[buckyyowza: Hello. Comments by Mark Fyffe.  I hope you enjoy my comments and find them useful, though I am only 4k on KGS so don't give me too much credit for knowing what I am talking about ;-)  Due to the behavior of some recent SGF readers, I am noting things a little different than I used to, please let me know if it is confusing ;-)
A circle means a space I think you should play, a square highlights thickness or good aji, and a triangle indicates bad aji, a dead group, an overplay or a mistake.

woldsom [10k\]: I am woldsom, playing white against sciencesgo, a fellow 10k on kgs'
woldsom [10k\]: I lost this game fairly big, due to a reading mistake, but was already behind, and would like a review focusing on the errors I am not myself aware of, as I know of several things I have a habit of doing wrong, and am already doing my best to eliminate.
woldsom [10k\]: I also have a few question about situations I am not sure I handled well]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[dj];W[jp]TR[pj]SQ[jj]CR[qf]C[buckyyowza:  Though fully resonable at K4, I really want this stone at R14.  As white, you're off to a slow start just because of having to play second, but that's what the komi is for.  I always like to think that the first order of business in an even game as white is to get sente, then to keep it ;-)  K4 has big influence, but definitely does not take sente -- this formation (three star points) is more common for black, whose intent might be to give sente in exchange for points, which he is in greater need of.

As far as Q10 goes, K4 is better.  For that matter, K16 would have been better for Black than D10;  this is because the stones relate to each other better: K4 builds shape from two sides, but Q10 only from one side (although it does have slightly more influence).  If you want a bigger star point, try K10, but only if you also want a bigger fight.]
;B[pj]
(;W[jd]LB[jd:A]CR[lc][mc][nc]C[buckyyowza: The fuseki is the most difficult part of the game to get right.  I like to think that the opening ends and the middle game begins when one player has messed it up and needs to start fighting to recover from the mistake ;-)  Black is poised for a strong center game, and will almost definitely do all he can to thwart any attempt by white to build large territory on the lower side.  White therefore has two choices: to play Black's game and clash in the center, or to play low, take the corners and try to keep Black from getting anything too large.  Either way, K16 is a nice move.  Not only is it thick and easy to keep alive, but it is currently the largest point on the board, and so it is urgent to prevent black from playing there in sente.  Despite all this, however, I would be inclined to play lower, a corner approach with O17, N17, or M17.  This gives black the choice of giving up a corner or handing over a solid base that neutralizes his thick position. See var. for some basic joseki based on White O17, and how they relate to this fuseki.

Which side or corner to play?  The big one ;-)  Corners are bigger than sides. You'll want to either punch a hole in your opponent's moyo or make some nice thickness to compliment your other groups.  If all else is equal it doesn't matter.  Which side to approach from?  Never rush into enemy lines without a backup plan.  Unless you have a clear escape route into an area where you have a lot of influence, always approach from the outside (the side with the most open space or thickness).  Whether to approach high or low depends on whether you want to focus on influence or territory and is entirely situational.  As a crude rule of thumb, approach from the outside in the opening, and from the inside in the middle game... but that is quite crude ;-)

woldsom [10k\]: I have little knowledge of the fuseki, and have been unable to get any new knowledge from studying games or problems. Is this stone wrong? Should 3 have been on Q10? What are the base principles when choosing what corner and what side to play?]
;B[cn];W[gq]TR[fq]SQ[jp]CR[nc][cp]C[woldsom [10k\]: This seems to use the K4 stone better than mere F3. Does it?

buckyyowza: F3 and G3 are equivalent here, and both are overplay because of K4.  Black has no real prospects on the lower side yet, and White's corner is not that large as to make this approach more urgent than the upper side.  I would prefer to follow up K16 with an approach to the upper right or left, O17 for example; in this case it would be Black, not White, who had played tenuki too early.  To play the lower left, I think that C4 is best to protect the corner, since K4 is already covering the lower side.]
;B[nq];W[lq]TR[nq]SQ[pj]CR[ql][pm]C[woldsom [10k\]: I am usually afraid to pincer, but here the pincer stone also grabs territory, and feels very solid and safe.

buckyyowza:  Actually, this fails to punish black for a poor choice at O3.  Black's stone is best as a "sute ishi," a sacrifice stone, and that is what you are making it.  Though quite solid, since White is well developed on the lower side already M3 is a bit slow.  This is because of the black stone at Q10.  Black should have approached from the other side for automatic development on the right side, and that is his best option once again only now he has the added influence of a sute ishi to assist this development.  Here I would prefer to play Q7 or R8 to reduce the Black right side moyo while taking the same points that you have taken with M3, just on the right instead of the bottom.]

(;B[qn]LB[qn:A][no:B]C[woldsom [10k\]: I expected O5

buckyyowza: See comments previous move.  Also the variation for why black would not play O5  ;-)]
;W[np]SQ[pj][qn]CR[pn][oo][oq][qq]C[buckyyowza: This should be somewhere else. O4 will give black easy life on the lower side or the corner, but normally for the trade off of White getting thickness or some points on the right side.  Because of R6 and Q10, this is not possible so White gets nothing.  Some better options might be P3, P5, Q6, or R3.  For contrast, Q6 is quite similar to O4 but works well because White is strong on the lower side, so it would help to build a center moyo.]
;B[op]CR[pq]C[woldsom [10k\]: Here I'm at a loss. What to do? I felt I handled it as best I could, but it was fairly bad, so I expect there are much better moves hidden that I can't spot

buckyyowza: You have attacked the wrong stone :-)  A good play now would be Q3 to protect the corner, which White cannot afford to lose.]
;W[oq];B[oo]
(;W[nr]CR[pq]C[woldsom [10k\]: The ladder from O4 doesn't work, so I felt the need to atari the stone at once, From below seemed to help q3 more than from the side

buckyyowza: Q3 is urgent for White!  Now the corner is lost and the game becomes much more difficult.  See var.]
;B[pq];W[or];B[qq]C[woldsom [10k\]: and black settles the corner, leaving just the ability to later monkey-jump in. I played first in this corner! What did I do wrong?]
;W[fc];B[cg];W[bp]SQ[fc]CR[cc]C[buckyyowza: You have approached the upper left corner, and Black has invited you in.  Why not invade?  Play C17 here instead.  As long as you have sente, the lower left corner is not in much danger at present.]
;B[dl]TR[cg]C[buckyyowza: This play and Black's previous play (C13) are very slow.  This could indicate that Black is aware of his lead.  Whether he is overconfident or overparanoid remains to be seen ;-)  Either way, it seems that the time is about right for a big fight over something that black holds dear, such as the right side.]
;W[mc]CR[qd][qh]C[woldsom [10k\]: I am also a bit afraid of being pincered, so this corner I aproached in this manner.

buckyyowza: The pincer is nothing to fear :-)  It is just one of many tools, and here would not be of much concern.  Imagine for a moment that black takes some of the upper side and eliminates your moyo there, but in exchange you get both corners and an extension to the center.  Doesn't this seem better than just holding a space on the upper side?  It may be unwise to place too much value on a single area, when more valuable areas can be traded for it.  At this stage, I would start to worry more about black taking too much on the right side and would play something mischevious, like R16 or R12..]
;B[qg];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]
(;W[pe]CR[pb]C[woldsom [10k\]: Is it wrong to play this here? My average opponent will not double hane after it, which I guess is why I tend to play it. Advantages/disadvantages?

buckyyowza: This stone is alright, though the aji of this play is all that is needed.  Though it has no real impact on the game other than eliminating a ko threat, this play tells your opponent "Notice that I can cut you here," while without it he has to notice on his own. Simply Q18 is enough to preserve your corner group. see var.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb]SQ[pe]CR[qb]C[woldsom [10k\]: only way I am confident I can live after double hane. What other choices are there?

buckyyowza: R18 is much bigger, and reserves the opportunity to cut from Q15.  see var on 34 or the correct sequence.  This play in unnecessarily complicated (it results in ko) and only takes part of the points White deserves.]
;B[pa];W[rd];B[qb];W[sc]CR[ra]C[buckyyowza: Black can play at S19 to kill White with a ko. see var]

(;B[se]LB[ra:B][se:A];W[ra];B[sf];W[sd]C[woldsom [10k\]: small small corner, but it felt good taking it away from black after the bottom right.]
;B[oe];W[pf]SQ[pe]C[woldsom [10k\]: realized the net worked just too late, had read out only the ladder.

buckyyowza: White now has two liberties, where before there was only one.  This is good aji ;-)  As with Q15, it is not needed to play this move to use its aji, but this is not exactly a bad play.]
;B[og];W[fe]CR[cc]C[woldsom [10k\]: With the top unsafe, I didn't dare go for the last corner.

buckyyowza: The top is actually quite safe, although it may be reduced a bit. Also, C17 is actually your best play here. Black has failed to take a commanding lead after White's slow opening, so there is still plenty of opportunity to come out ahead in this game, and the upper left corner is the last place for large scale invasion without too much conflict. Nonetheless, a one space jump that builds moyo is almost always a good choice.]
;B[dc];W[ch]SQ[dg]CR[nf][eg][en]C[woldsom [10k\]: Realized that black had huge and solid right side, felt I had to invade to make up

buckyyowza: Black can simply play D13 here to render your invasion failed and reduce your influence over the remaining space on the board.  With the strong formations both players have on the board, White's best plan for taking the lead is to reduce in sente.  While invasion may be possible, it will likely not be worth the cost.  Consider some larger plays like E6, O14, E13 instead to get the points you need.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[eh];W[ei];B[di]CR[fh]C[woldsom [10k\]: Didn't expect this, now I'm stuck and desperate

buckyyowza: A misread is often inevitible :-)  In this case, it best to make the most of a bad situation.  Consider F12 now to gracefully recover.]

(;W[eg]CR[fh]C[buckyyowza: This is the wrong direction.  While you may get lucky with the aji later on, it is not worth the risk. Now Black can easily dominate the center... the only neutral space left on the board.  Since he has a sufficient lead, this play is suicide.]
;B[fh];W[de];B[ce];W[fg]C[woldsom [10k\]: Realized I couldn't get anything at the side, and focused on expanding my top territory]
;B[gh];W[hg];B[eo];W[ep];B[fo];W[gk]SQ[hn]CR[hh][mk]C[woldsom [10k\]: saw the danger of the black moyo. Better place to attack?

buckyyowza: G9 is too far from any base to have much hope of success; Black can play something like H6 to hinder it. H12 seems better to me, though still a bit close to the action considering Black's strength. N9 is probably White's best bet for countering the thickness.  Though Black's right side is strong, it is not invulnerable, and White needs something quite dramatic to win the game.]
;B[fj];W[no]C[woldsom [10k\]: wanted a wall so I could go for center territory to make up for the bigger black sides]
;B[nn];W[on];B[po];W[mn]TR[no]CR[mk]C[buckyyowza: Here you are helping Black secure a large territory on the right side.  Perhaps a play like N9 would have been better instead of O5 to reduce this area.]
;B[nm];W[mm];B[nl];W[ml];B[nk];W[hn]C[woldsom [10k\]: ...and got it. Realize after blacks move that this stone might need to be at H5

buckyyowza: If black comes in from the left, just take more above... and vice versa.  At H5, you'd be more vulnerable to keshi from above.]
;B[fp];W[fq];B[ho];W[io];B[hp];W[iq];B[hq];W[hr];B[ip]TR[io]
CR[in]C[woldsom [10k\]: Ow...

buckyyowza: J5 should have been at J6 to prevent this sort of play, but Black is asking for trouble as we will see later on ;-)]
;W[jq];B[in];W[jo];B[im]C[woldsom [10k\]: Game over if I back down now]
;W[hm];B[il];W[hj];B[ii];W[ij];B[jj];W[hh];B[hi];W[jk];B[ik]
;W[ji];B[kj];W[gi];B[ih];W[fi]TR[ih]C[buckyyowza: Aha! This is more than enough for White to win the game. Black play at J12 was an enormous mistake no matter how you look at it.  That move should have been played at F11.]
;B[gj]C[woldsom [10k\]: here I changed my mind, and went after J8 instead of the three black stones at F12. Was it really bigger?]
;W[hk]TR[eh][fh][gh]SQ[ch][dh][ih][hi][ii]CR[gg]C[buckyyowza: Oh no!  You gave it back! ;-)  G13 would have erased a good 30 points of Black's left side territory in addition to gaining an amount of center territory equivalent to have you have gained with H9.  Not only that, but G13 retains sente; H9 does not.]

CR[kf]C[buckyyowza: Atari is not always the best option.  Consider instead this stone at L14.  That play would still be in sente because of the aji at L12, but you would be one point better.]
;B[ki];W[kf];B[lg];W[lf];B[mf]C[woldsom [10k\]: was happy to consolidate my top area]
;W[mg];B[lh]
(;W[me]TR[nf]C[woldsom [10k\]: realize that O14 works here, while N15 settles for less than I could get

buckyyowza: Actually, O14 does not work. N15 is the correct direction. See var.]
;B[nf]
(;W[bm]SQ[ip]CR[bn]C[woldsom [10k\]: I tend to overplay when behind, and make moves that a little reading should tell me don't work. Is the monkey jump the best option here, with so few black stones up close?

buckyyowza: Remeber J4?  Black has a liberty shortage near here that can be exploited with B6. See variations for some ideas along these lines, though this situation is far too complex to trust me on ;-)]
;B[bn];W[dn];B[do];W[co];B[bo]C[woldsom [10k\]: Saw my chance when black didn't play D7]
;W[go]CR[cp]C[buckyyowza: White has to play C4 first!  It is too easy for Black to live in the corner now.  That is great that you are seeing this liberty shortage, but don't forget to watch out for your own stones ;-)]
;B[gp];W[fn];B[cp];W[en];B[co];W[fk]C[woldsom [10k\]: I know I shouldn't play this, removes some of the aji of c7. My only thought was "sente reducing move"]
;B[dm];W[cq]CR[dr]C[woldsom [10k\]: horrible shape, but felt I could get away with just losing B4

buckyyowza: yes, this should be at D2];B[eq];W[dq];B[er]C[woldsom [10k\]: Didn't expect this at all]
;W[fr]C[woldsom [10k\]: counted liberties, and felt that this was enough to save D3]
;B[cr]C[woldsom [10k\]: Didn't see the reasoning behind this move, figured it was easilly counterable with D2, so looked for more]
;W[bq]C[woldsom [10k\]: 4 vs 3 liberties I counted, assuming black D2 white B2]
;B[cm]C[woldsom [10k\]: had forgotten about that one.];W[cf]
C[woldsom [10k\]: silly overplay again];B[df];W[ee];B[bf]C[woldsom [10k\]: did black even have to take?

buckyyowza: No, but he is quite comfortable in this position so there is no reason for him not to be conservative.]
;W[eb];B[dr]C[woldsom [10k\]: And game over. No hope after already being behind.]

[mc:26][fe:50][pe:34][pf:48][eg:58][kh:30][hk:10][mn:74]C[woldsom [10k\]: Even if I'd have survived there, I'd be behind by some 20 points, with few options left. Where was all this lost? Was I that much behind already after R3? Should I have gone for C17? Were my walls on starting at O5 and later at J13 wrong? I got my territory, but realize black got some too.
woldsom [10k\]: Any advice, general or specific, are welcome. In advance, thank you.

buckyyowza: Thank you very much for the opportunity to go over this game.  In this game are some good examples of potential flaws in your thinking that should not be too difficult to correct:

1) It is not stones that win the game, it is points.  Although some areas may appear large, often it is only some stones creating that illusion.  Be sure to not become confused by this bad aji.  When determining the value of an area be sure to count all of the points: the potential territory, the territory lost in an exchange, and, of course, the dead stones.  Early in the game, you spared no expense to save the stone at O4, but in fact that stone was worth little and you lost a large corner in saving it.  At W110, you give up a chance to erase a large side moyo in exchange for a few more stones.

2) Let sleeping aji lie :-).  Like a wise man will say little but mean a lot, there is no need to bring your aji out in the spotlight in order for it to work. Sometimes by pushing it in the wrong direction or by using it prematurely, even the best taste can turn sour.  Though not directly bad, plays like W34, W48, and W130 scream "HEY! LOOK AT MY AJI!" At W52, you tried an invasion when reduction would have been simpler. At W58 and W74, a push in the wrong direction gives Black a nice advantage.

3) Be bold!  Even if you don't know what you are doing, your opponent doesn't know that ;-)  Too often you are failing to take the larger play because you do not feel confident that you can pull it off.  Of course, if you are in the lead then it is prudent to play conservative, but when behind as in this game risk taking is often the only way to win.  At W22, you played a bold approach to one of black's corners, but to follow up you protected one of your own that was not really in play, allowing Black a chance to strengthen his shape without consequence.  At W26, you are over concerned about your upper side, but not concerned enough about Black's right side.  At W50 you gave up your last big chance to take control of the game without a fight.

Thanks again!  I hope I have not been too hard on you, and that you have enjoyed reading over my comments :-)  I always enjoy an opportunity to review a good game, and this has been no exception.  If you have any questions about this review, or about anything else ;-), please feel free to contact me at mark@accessidaho.org or look for bucky on KGS.]
