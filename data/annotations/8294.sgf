C[G: Hi, this is Gergely (EGF 3k at KGS about 1d) from Hungary, your humble reviewer.  I'll mark my comments by "G:"
--------------------

Hello, my name is Michal and I play for about half a year now. I'm 10k on KGS and this is a game from there. I'm white, so please review that and mistakes of black I didn't see.

In this game, although I won it was only because of my opponent's mistake. Generally I allowed to cut myself and be surrounded only to fail to make life. I understand my reading isn't good, and I practice tsumego to improve that. Some general comments on my overall strategy would be very helpful though.

Thanks!];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[nc]

Black could have played at N17 in this situation, right?
-------------

G: Maybe, I dont think it matters at our level. :) This way you surely wont invade the corner (S16 still possible thougt). In case of N17 there is aji at p17 and r17.]
;W[ci];B[fq];W[cn];B[jq]LB[fp:B][eq:A]TR[hq]C[Now I know this extension is once space too wide. I have trouble figuring out when to exploit such overplays. Should I wait once chuban starts (but it's potentiall may be lost during fighting, doesn't it?) or use it right away? How to estimate worth of such a move like H3 here?

----------- 

G: I would not say it is unplayable. Of course 3 space extension is weaker than 2 space extension but you should consider what exactly this weakness is. Of course white can cut at triangle, but in this case corner is still open for invasion. And what if white protect the corner at A? Black B would be natural answer but then J3 would be a bit overconcentrated. I dont think K3 is bad at all.

Because of this i would chose some pincer  instead of c16.]
(;W[rd];B[qc];W[jd];B[kc]
(;W[kd]LB[ce:A]TR[jc]C[Here I've chosen influence towards the center. Is that a good direction?

----------

G: I would've chosen a block. Its works nicely  with D17. After white K17  play around A would be huge move. At the other hand Black's top right group already alive (in small), extending from it doesnt worth much. 

What if we start a wall building race? Who gets more? (see var)

Overall Black L17 only helps white but L16 ruins the opportunity.]
;B[jc];W[md]TR[jd][kd]C[G: you shouldnt try to build influence by force. Be flexible.Try to find moves with dual purpose. "If she build territory i get influence, if she wont let me do this, i build territory..."

This move says : I *want* influence. But black will be super strong at the top, your upper left is still open, and your marked stones are floating.]
;B[mc];W[ld]C[G: 
Left side still worth more. It is hard to use this small wall segment for fight (what is the essence of all walls)]
;B[pf];W[qf];B[qe];W[re];B[ne]LB[id:C][de:D][ol:A][fo:B]TR[qe]
C[G: These are very small moves (only strengthens white) There are many much bigger moves.]
;W[lc];B[lb];W[ic];B[ib];W[hc];B[hb];W[gc];B[df]C[Now how to deal with this invasion? I took the corner (or so I thought...) and then attacked from the weaker side. Was my strategy bad overall or only the execution was bad?

G: your strategy is good i think.  However do you think upper side is the weaker side? It seems somewhat strange to me, because you made that upper wall "to get influence". 
(and indeed you get it, so we cannot say that is weak)  

To use your wall effeciently you should crush your opponent's forces onto that wall.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[be];B[bf];W[eh];B[ff];W[ef]LB[he:A][gg:C][gh:B]
C[G: Not a best thought. word of advice: never cut an ikken tobi blindly. If you are absolutely sure it will work, do it, but if you are not -- dont cut. 

Black is running and that is a very good thing. No need to slice it to pieces. As black plays more and more stones here (and get nothing) failing to save them getting more and more frightening. White can chase it with pleasure and get profit by every move.

Please consider the situation at move 35. I think we can agree in that black is not dead there. A good general will not try to kill what cannot be killed. But he will get out the most of the situation. In this case it means chasing and chasing. (If black eventually dies nevertheless, white general wont drop any tears :) 

You might play super solid at A (black cannot cut either way, but after A black cannot even play forcing move)  of course you can continue chasing at B or C.]
;B[ee];W[eg];B[de];W[fe]TR[ef]C[Now in retrospect, I think that was just a plain mistake. I created many small separated groups and threatened my corner (which I eventually lost along with a big group). I would think now D16 would be better. Is that right?

G: Yes, dangerous to cut now. Thats why triangled stone was not a good timeing in the first place.]

(;W[hd]LB[he:A]C[G: A seems to be better option.];B[he];W[gf]
;B[fc];W[gb];B[fb];W[ga];B[cd]C[After that the corner just died, I think. Do you agree?

---------------
G: well, if you want to save every single piece and in the meantime masacre black no matter what, i would say yes, corner will die.

If your goal is simply live in the corner and get some prisoners, you can always exchange your two warriors for black's four. see var]
(;W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb];W[cb];B[dd]C[
G: It is said If you are in hard situation, sacrifice something. Black almost certainly alive, best possible solution should be to live in *sente* and find a new battlefield.

see var.]
(;W[db];B[ab];W[ba];B[ae]
(;W[fa]C[So I've connected and saved at least a part of this. After that I should have connected at J15 and run. Do you agree? I would have a group on the run, but how bad is that in this situation? The group has a lot of liberties, yet not even a single eye. Is there any way I could settle/connect it quickly?

----------

G: I might misunderstood something but why would you play J15?  If white general decides to fortify instead of saving the corner H15 is a dead meat.]
;B[fg];W[fh];B[gg];W[hf];B[ie];W[if];B[dk];W[fk]LB[fo:A]TR[dk]
C[Outside - good or bad in this case? Would C9 be better? What about D10?

----------

G: Its getting very difficult fight. I think its good idea to cap since white would like to invade black's lower side. Chasing a  black stone is a natural way to do it. 

For black this invasion is needless. Simply jump out at A is enough to keep the lead.]

(;W[dh]C[G: Empty triangle. (bad shape) How about var?];B[fj]

G: please keep in mind our goal not to utterly annihilate all black forces in the area (what is impossible).  The goal is make black heavy and make it flee. (and destroy black's lower side in the process.)]

G: It is very fortunate that black wants to save every stones. Chasing is very pleasant now (and hurts black lower influence quiet a much) but white shouldnt forget to capture the upper cutting stones.

;W[eq];B[fr];W[er];B[ap]LB[am:D][bp:B][cp:A][bq:C]C[I have problems when dealing with monkey jumps like this when I don't have any stones around - all my stones are high. Could I have done better? Did my opponent used this monkey jump to its full potential? Could he kill me with it?

------------

G: There are very rare cases when monkeys kill, but most of the time they are just jumping. Thats the nature of the monkeys :)

(There are some forcing moves in monkey jumps, so that they are not very good at killing. Maybe A or B can make some trouble but i cant see a clean way of killing, what is certainly my limitation :))

In general C is the proper deffense against monkeys in high position.

But in this very case you might even try to fight back using a ko at D.]

G: you can try,  but considering white weakness at the both side, trying to escape with an almost dead (in fact dead) group doesnt make too much sense. Even if you succeed, the punishment (at left or right) will be huge.]

Interesting end of a very bloody game. Some general comments: 

If you think you are in trouble sacrify something. (of course the best if you can sacrify your opponent's stones but it is not always possible :-))

You should not want to kill so badly. Sometimes its better to make enemy stones weak than even kill them. 

It is always more easy to chase your pray than win a difficult and dubious fight. This is flexibility.  Every single moves while you are hunting, your pray will get exactly 0 points, while you get strength or even territory.

I hope i could help, cheers,
