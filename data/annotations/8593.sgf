C[Thank you in advance for the review.

A view remarks on my current state:

This game moved me from 9k to 8k for the first time.
I began playing only a few months ago and am purely self-taught (no teachers/other players nearby). During the early time I spent most of my time reading teaching material.

When I started to play ranked games I quickly rose up to 10k where I hit a border. I am now slowly starting to make my first steps in the single-digit kyu area, but I cannot really see what is blocking me.

If you can see weaknesses that you believe to transcend this game and could be an important point for improvement, I'd love to get pointed in the general direction.

(I was white in this game.)


--- Hi Erasmas, this is Vinyoo. I will be reviewing your game.

In the beginning, you invaded a bit too early at P10. Black secured the upper right corner and might lead a bit. Then, black's mistake in the lower left caused the game to be even. Then, black's failure in the middle decided the game.

I think you did quite well for a 9k. To improve your strategy, I suggest you read "Attack and Defence" book by Ishida Akira. It might be a bit difficult for 9k but you can learn a lot without following all of their moves in the book.

To improve in general, try to solve a lot of life-and-death problems that are in your skill range. Also, play a lot of games with people a bit stronger than you are. 

Lastly, enjoy playing the games :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]C[Erasmas [9k\]: hi hf]
;W[dc];B[fq];W[dn];B[hp]C[--- This black should be at K4 or J4 instead.]
;W[qn];B[pl]C[--- This is not the most widely-used approach by black, but playable.

Normally, black plays R8];W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[--- Because of black Q8, it is not good to play R4. Black should play Q3 to seal white in. 

See variation];W[pq];B[op]
(;W[nq]C[--- This is a bit unusal for white. Black can seal off the bottom. See variation

The normal move is S4 for white]
(;B[mo]C[--- With aji at P3, white should play N3.]
(;W[pj]C[I'm not very familliar with this situation and hoped to find a base around R13 after the pincer

--- You should play S4 to secure the bottom white group first.

Black is strong in this area. It would be difficult for white to get a good result with a direct invasion like this.

There are a lot of open space that white can benefits. I would prefer C15 or O17 to this move.]
;B[qk]
(;W[qj]C[Unsure here. Black will extend, I lose the base, but didn't know what else to play.

--- This R10 make white group heavy. I do not find a good follow up locally. The best might be R13, Q13, or R14.

However, since local play does not look good, I would suggest ignore R9 as the forcing move and play O17 directly.]
;B[qf]C[as expected];W[rk];B[rl];W[pk];B[ql];W[ol]C[trying to switch to influence here while attacking

--- This is a good idea to create thickness for white];B[pn]
;W[no]C[--- The bottom white group is quite weak. Black is not in danger.

Maybe Q7 immediately might work better for white];B[np];W[nn]
;B[mq];W[nr];B[mr];W[pm]C[attack continues. I liked this move a lot, as it nicely attacks and completes my wall.
(however, it was risky too, because I couldn't really read it out against bP7)

--- This is a good move. However, there is a danger of the bottom group dying.

White should play S4 or S3 to make the bottom group lives first.

See variation on how black might be able to kill white]
(;B[rn]C[Black should play S10.];W[qm];B[rm];W[on]C[not sure if P7 is better. I preferred the option of a possible eye at Q6 here

--- P7 is better. Move solid.];B[rq]C[--- Now it is black's chance to kill white]
;W[rr]C[Now S4 might kill white as I show in the variation of move 33.]
;B[ro]C[--- This move spoils black opportunity];W[sq];B[rp]
;W[qs];B[pr];W[or]C[--- Let's review the situation.

Even after black failure to kill white at the bottom-right corner, black gets more solid territory (at the bottom) with sente. So, I think black might lead  a bit.

The reason, I think is the premature invasion at Q10.];B[ce]
;W[ee]TR[jc][kc][lc][mc][jd][kd][ld][md]C[This move looks like it try to build a wall. It might works if white has a stone around marked area.

I think white around C13/D13/C12/D12 area looks better]
(;B[ch];W[id];B[kd];W[kc]C[In hindsight.. I guess C9 would have been better?

--- C9 or C16 would be better than this move. It strengthen black area to become territory]
;B[lc];W[kb];B[jd];W[jc]C[--- J14 is the correct shape.];B[lb]
;W[ib]C[gote.. again];B[lf];W[ng];B[lh];W[mi];B[ck]C[there it goes :(]
;W[cl]
(;B[co]C[fortunately, black messed up the invasion

C[--- Disaster for black. Now black is no longer leading];B[dr]
;W[cr];B[dq];W[ep];B[qh];W[ph];B[ri]C[--- Too small. Black should play C16.

For local move, Q13 is better];W[qi];B[rj]C[Unnecessary. Black should play S12.]
;W[qg];B[rg];W[rh];B[pg];W[og];B[qh]C[--- Not much to gain for black even if he wins this ko. Should just play Q14 instead.]
(;W[nd]C[I probably should have invaded 3/3 sometime around now... but never really know when the moment's there. I tried later, which was probably way too late.

--- Yes, you should think about Invasion at R17 or Q17 now.

The move at O16 is not a good ko treat since black can cut off this stone with O15.

This ko is not so big for both sides. I think it is OK to ignore the ko and play elsewhere.]

;B[sh];W[me];B[pf];W[el]C[lost focus here and forgot to protect N13.]
;B[mg]C[of course black takes the opportunity];W[mh];B[lg];W[ld]
C[desperation really.];B[le];W[md];B[nc]C[I couldn't read up to this point, or I would probably have gone another way.

Nevertheless, at this point I got sente back. With the following moves I tried to get some center territory for the right group by attacking bottom.]
;W[ko];B[oh]C[.. so much for that sente understanding.

--- Your previous move is OK. Black P12 is small. White P13 group is not a cutting stone.

You can play P11 to keep the damage minimum.]

;W[mn];B[pi];W[ni];B[ph];W[nm]C[no idea why black didn't play the P8 variation here.

--- Yes, he should play P8];B[qo];W[ol];B[nk]C[that seemed gote, so I continued my earlier plan.

--- Bad move by black. Should play K3, K4, or C17 instead];W[lo]
;B[mp];W[dj]C[I didn't really know far upwards I could go, so decided to first build a wall against the black one around M13.

What would have been better at this point? Tengen? K14? H6? L11? I didn't like either very much for some reason.

--- It is a good idea to press weak black group to wall off the center. I prefer D9 to this move though.]
;B[eh]
(;W[di]LB[bc:D][cc:C][bd:B][cd:A]C[Black again went away and took the big point at B17, which I didn't see at the time.
If I had wanted to get it instead of D10, which of these move should I have taken?

I tend to go with A or D. But they can seem gote, just as well as C and B's followup.

--- The standard move is A. I think every move here is gote. So, A is the best since it takes the most profit.

See variation.];B[bc];W[dh];B[dg];W[df];B[cf];W[eg];B[cg];W[fh]
;B[hk];W[jk]C[not sure here what was more important.. getting the ladder to work or getting territory with the right group?

;B[bk];W[io];B[ip];W[gp];B[ho]
(;W[hl]C[wasn't too certain of my liberties, but I believe H6 would still have been fine here.

--- H6 is OK. See variation.];B[gq];W[hn];B[jh];W[ig]C[is that too aggressive?

--- This is OK. Black probably should continue with J12 though]
;B[jf];W[if];B[ie];W[he];B[je]C[Not sure here. Protect the cut points, or make sure black doesn't connect anything? the latter seemed greater at the time.]
;W[ih];B[ii];W[ji];B[jg]C[For the remainder of the game I was somehow trying to find a way to kill this large black center group... but couldn't succeed.

I was wasting a lot of time thinking about this kill. Would it be safe to say that with 4 liberties vs the 2 of my N16 group there is no way to kill, or is it worth investing that time?

--- Your analysis is correct. Black has 4 liberties vs white 2. There is no way for white to win except purely by black's mistakes.]
;W[hd];B[de];W[ef];B[db]C[another large one. I was afraid of C18, because I couldn't really read farther than the following variation.]

--- Simply play B8 without sacrify A9 is better.];W[bh]C[simply a mistake]
;B[ah];W[qc]C[.. as mentioned earlier, this is probably too late.

I won the game by time and by score as well. However, it was only due to Black messing up the LL invasion and the whole center area.
