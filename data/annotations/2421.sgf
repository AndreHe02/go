C[IJT:
Hi, my name is Ignacio and I played White on this one. I would like to
hear your comments about the opening, and I also have questions on
particular moves. Thanks a lot for your time reviewing the game, and
hope this will help me analyze my lousy play =)

rhi: hi ignacio,
I'am richard, playing 10 kyu in france.

I'm happy to review your game:
    - I like looking at stones :)
    - It looks like you know what you're looking for, and I hope my advices will serve.


let's see ;). .......];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[qd]LB[qc:B][pd:A]
[qe:C]C[IJT: Is that the "symmetrically correct" answer? Could I have just played on A instead?


RHI: ok, At my level I can't tell you why you'd better play A B or C ...
Why
choose one particularly depends on what j"osekis" could come up then,
and what inflence those future positions could make on the goban.

However, You're not obliged to play simetrically, and A would be good too.

In fact, it should depend on what kind of moves you know yet around that corner point,
or which ones you would like to experiment.];B[jq];W[kc]LB[gc:A]
C[This is ok to me, even if I rarely play such fuseki.

Yours looks like the chinese one !
(impressive fuseki for those who don't know it)

Here, I guess you should expect things like A
or around perhaps];B[cf];W[ci]TR[jd]C[rhi:
yes !
this is right direction:
you can pince blakc as you already have a stone around middle edge hoshi.]
;B[eg]
(;W[ei]C[rhi:
yep, you have to try to escape
avoid surrounding of black,
but ...
you have another weaker stone which you should defend first ..
see variation before]
(;B[ck];W[gh]LB[gh:A][gi:B]C[still
in danger white should consider tobi (A) to fly away, while keima (B)
is reserved for attacking moves. here, white first has to defend him
self.];B[fk];W[ff]C[Ok, this is the good direction for white:
capping black to shrunk possibilities];B[ef];W[ee];B[ce];W[cd]
;B[de]C[arghlll,
very bad shape for black :(
Will see another one later, remind the 
"empty triangle" horrible shape.


"hooommmm: empty triange is horrible"
"hommmm: empty triangle is horrible "
"horrible: hommptriangle is ummy "
"hoblemmmm triangulumm ..."

please, never play emptriangles. :-)];W[fd]C[goood,
this is good protection (it was the right place to play at that time)]
;B[bh];W[qm]LB[fd:A][bi:C][qm:B]TR[pn][qn]SQ[qj]C[IJT:
Did I need to cover A (F16) or could I played R7 before? By the way, is
R7 a good approach for the right side? Are the marked places too close
or too far away from R16?


rhi: A was the most urgent move at that time.
so better (far) than R7.
R7 is a good place to attack,
but
you must know that black "will" go to marked place (as white did
before, and for the same reason) so you should be prepared to it.

Marked stone are'nt too close. There are conventionnal places to approache black corner hoshi.
The choice depends on what josekis you're prepared to receive/play. (as usual :)


But unfortunately, it is absolute not the time to approach that part of the goban:
The battle in the upper left region isn't finish yet.
And unless you'd be cleary aware about the respective values of  'B' and'C',
I guess you'd better finish battle.
C is an important move to split black's forces.

But in fact, B is the second important place of the goban where to play.
So B isn't foolish.]
(;B[ro]LB[bi:1][qj:2][np:3]C[hum, as you already know, this is not the good move for black.(here, pinceris better)

In order of importance: 1 2 or 3];W[pj]C[yes, good: you stabilize while extending while gaining center influence.
good move];B[om];W[pl];B[mm];W[gj]LB[bi:A][mj:B][dl:C][ep:D]
C[Hu ? what for exactly ?
A (of course ;) looks better in this region.
To gain sphere of influence, B looks better too.
C is a good pointer to blacks other weakness,
preparing nice jump to D.
(this is a nice attacking technique called "leaning attack").
This last one has my preference.

(but in fact, you're move protect a problematic cut .. so .. not really sure about the latter ;)]
;B[gk]C[good, solid answer.
Perhaps right now the balance favors black.];W[nl]LB[mk:A]C[IJT: Would have been better to play A?

rhi:
yes, A is enough to protect you're influence sphere (I even adviced one step higher)
while you're actual move will strenghten black's position.]
;B[lk];W[lj]C[ignaciot [15k?\]: hope you're right];B[kk];W[kj]
C[totalgolai [20k\]: i think i'm right];B[nm];W[ol];B[hj];W[hi]
;B[fj];W[gi]LB[fi:A]C[IJT: I know this is a bad shape. Probably I should have played at A and try a ko.

 
rhi: you're right. but especially because now black can cut white's stones.]

(;B[ij];W[ji];B[fq]LB[bi:A]C[hum, It looks like you divided the goban in two parts.
which one is bigger ?
White's sphere is bigger than black's one (not considering upper left black's group).

white frontiere however looks weaker.

So finally, the big place to play is still A cutting blacks life space !
(after considering connecting white)];W[qo]LB[bd:C][od:B][bi:A]
[mj:D][qq:E]C[:(
this is .. yes, forcing move perhaps... 
but doesn't gain much point, and it's not worth considering that black still can erod white's territory .
This was a "yose" move ... There are much bigger points on the go ban:
a b c d, at least E come before];B[qp];W[po];B[oo];W[pn]C[("hommmmm" ;)]
;B[on];W[ml];B[ll];W[mk];B[jj];W[ii];B[jk];W[kh];B[mq]
(;W[ch]LB[bi:A]TR[cg]C[IJT: I guess the marked place (C13) should have been better.

rhi: dunno, A is the only place to play first

but with the presence of more black stones, the battle becomes more complicated.

In fact, we have to connect first, then ...
see variation before.];B[cg];W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[df];W[di];B[bi]
C[:( black get more advance here];W[be];B[bf];W[bd];B[cj];W[fg]
;B[bj];W[af];B[ag];W[ae];B[bg];W[dj];B[dk];W[ek];B[el];W[ej]
;B[fi];W[fh]LB[nc:B][qg:A]C[IJT:
These were all quite small moves, I think. I should have played bigger
points around A or B I guess.

rhi: yess ! you're ritht as we discussed about it before.
This is good that you have in mind that feeling about most important move.]
;B[cn];W[oc]C[In fact, I'm not very good at estimating:
my analyser says white is better by about 20 points.
So white hasn't lost at that black move in the upper left corner.
apologizes.];B[qf]LB[qf:B][qg:A][qh:C]C[IJT:
Should have I covered A/B instead? Did Black have less chances of doing
damage in the upper border?

rhi: 
C was the right place to restreign blacks eye space.];W[pg]
;B[qg];W[qh];B[rh]
(;W[pf]C[see
variation];B[qi];W[ph];B[qj];W[qe]C[You still have to block blakcs
connexion between his upper edge group and downer linving stones.]

;B[rm]TR[qm][pn][qn][po][qo]C[IJT: I wonder how could I saved this group, if there was a chance.

rhi: here, you witness the very very bad shape that represent the "empty" triangle.

one of your goals will be to recognize and avoid such shapes.


If
you studied my variations, you discovered that I gave them to black: 6
poor points aren't worth the killing of black's "illegitime" group ;)]
;W[rj];B[ri]LB[sg:A]C[Hey !
you still can kill black's group !
It's not living yet !
Kill It !
(psss: at A )];W[pi];B[si];W[sg]C[yessss !];B[sk]C[Arghh, that was one move two late ...
so close but so far ;)];W[sh]C[IJT: BAD BAD PLAY!! At least I could have played S13 and get the upper group, I imagine.


rhi:
ok, this is not so bad if you noticed it.
You can play bad moves, but you still have the good eye. That's pretty good skill that will help improve very fast.]
;B[rg];W[pk];B[sj];W[ni]C[IJT: Was this necessary?];B[jn];W[cb]
C[IJT: Was this necessary?];B[tt];W[dg]C[Ok Ignacio,
I really liked reviewing that game: many interesting moves and flow of time.
 
 I hope I was usefull in some manner.

I repeat my main impression:
- you have the good eye
either on local play where at least you notice you errors,
- and on the global point of view, where your roughly understand the direction.

I would advice to work your reading skill:

- try to solve some reading problem (on the books or the net)
- do tsume-go problems two.
- improve you're fighting skill (reading in middle game) while in your games.

You'll gain self confidence a play more agressive moves.

Good luck and keep playing ;)

Well, this is it. Maybe the key moves to win this match could have been
saving the lost group un the bottom-right and killing some of the
stones of Black's big group on the right border. I'm not sure if this
would have made a difference, anyway.
