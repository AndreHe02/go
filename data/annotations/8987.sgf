C[Hi! This is Joonas Pihlajamaa aka. finity at GTL, 2k EGF and ~1k KGS (2k-1d :), and I'll be reviewing your game. 

You asked especially about fuseki and joseki, so I'll try to comment those a bit more. Overall, you won by a fair margin so in total the opponent did more bad moves. :)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[po]C[5-4 is an interesting opening and especially around kyu level may often lead to josekis that are known to only one of the players...]
;B[pq]LB[np:A][qq:B]C[As you may know, white A is a common move used by the player with 5-4 to continue with the influence strategy of Q5. B is also common and simple, mainly differing from white approach of Q3 stone (if black had played that first) in that white retains sente (see variation)]
(;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]LB[qk:A][mp:C][nq:B]C[This joseki usually continues with A to settle white shape. See variation. If white wants to play on bottom, B is the usual point, or C if white had a stone around A (which he now doesn't have).

The move played in the game is not joseki, and it leaves this white group a bit weak (see variations)]
(;W[mq]
(;B[rq]C[Slow and gote move...];W[rp];B[sr]
(;W[ql]LB[rp:B][rq:A]TR[qk]C[White could easily go one further, especially now after A-B exchange (see variation)]
;B[fq];W[iq]C[Nice pincer & extension combo!];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr]
;W[cq];B[jq]LB[ip:A][jp:B][jr:C]TR[fo][fq][dr]C[Here, I'd consider A-C and probably play A myself, to separate K3 from triangled stones.]
(;W[io]
(;B[jp];W[ip];B[fm]C[Very bad exchange from black, forcing white to separate and then playing elsewhere.]
(;W[lo]C[This seems a bit risky, inviting black to cut...]
(;B[lp];W[mp]
(;B[lq];W[ko];B[mr];W[dl]C[Cutting point at A is still quite big, but of course so is this and while F5 stones are weak, black may not want to make J5 stones run.]
;B[jc];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qh]C[Too hasty, I feel.];W[of];B[oh]
;W[qc]C[Very good. Black now has a weak group to defend, and white made points in black's corner.]
;B[pc];W[mf];B[jo];W[in]
(;B[hl];W[jn]C[Good.];B[qk];W[pk];B[pj]
(;W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[oo];W[op]C[I'm not sure of this move, but it may just work. Anyways, shows a good fighting spirit!]
;B[pp]C[Now that black played this, P3 feels like a must.]
(;W[pn]LB[no:B][np:A]C[I was about to suggest black A now, but white would just answer at B. Q6 is a good move!]
;B[mh];W[kg]C[Hard to attack the black group this way, maybe just take points away at S9 and threaten this attack?]
(;B[lg];W[lf]LB[kf:B][kh:A]C[I feel black should play A or B now and white would have a harder time.]

;B[mm];W[ba];B[ab];W[kr]C[Good game for white overall. There were some less-than-perfect moves in the beginning, but black played consistently more bad moves, losing ground during the whole game. 

There were also a few lax moves in the endgame that could be improved with additional reading, but overall I feel white read deeply enough.

Also, see move 106 - around this point of middle game it is important to spend a few minutes evaluating the situation to find big sente moves - they often are enough to turn the game.]
