C[Hi thanks for reviewing the game.  I play 
white.  I think I messed up the opening so comments on fuseki are most 
welcome.

Eric: Hi, thanks for the opportunity to review.  My fuseki knowledge is 
limited, but I hope it's worth something.  Just in case you're not already 
aware of it, you can find good fuseki in Kogo's joseki dictionary, 
gobase.org, and GoGoD.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq]TR[nc]
C[Eric:  As white, it seems that I misplayed this position until 
recently -- I would often play j3 in this situation, for example -- but I 
got okay results anyway.  Slight strategic mistakes in the opening are 
usually no big deal unless they affect your mindset.

The sequences I give for h3 and k3 are taken from Kogo's.  The symmetrical 
move at O17 is probably okay too.  Lots of moves, c6 and c7 included, look 
decent.]
(;W[cn]C[Could you show me some variations with pincers here, and tell me if 
they are better for white.  Black gets a pretty solid bottom side after 
sliding into D2.

Eric: That's true, but the side is low and white has the potential to make 
good territory by pushing down over top of it, and there is still plenty of 
space for a white invasion along the bottom after j3.];B[dr]
;W[cq];B[iq];W[qj]LB[nc:C][jd:B][dj:A]C[A (D10) and B (K16) also seem big how do I 
choose between them?

Eric:  Move A gives white too many stones on one side of the board, I feel.  
I prefer C to B, since C is both an extension and an approach, and since 
black r10 is such a natural-looking response to white B.

I would put off invasions like r10 until other big points have been played.  
Black's groups can expect to get nicer shape than r10 will.  Of course, 
white probably hopes that black will also have to invade eventually, and 
black's invading group will also have imperfect shape.];B[jd]
;W[gc]C[bad move right? D10 better.

Eric:  Tough call.  G17 looks okay to me.  If black invades the left side, 
it's white that will get the better shape there.  Saying to your opponent, 
"I've invaded your moyo, now you have to invade mine," makes a kind of 
sense.  D10 looks nice, but it also leaves black with a nice-looking move at 
F17.  Finally, R14 is worth considering (my feeling is that it's better than 
R6, since there's more potential for black to make a nice-looking moyo at 
the bottom than at the top).

Maybe I should have left this review to someone who has stronger opinions 
about fuseki!  Still, I'd like to repeat the usual advice not to worry too 
much about the opening.];B[cf]
(;W[ch]C[Eric:  See the white C16 variation, though this doesn't look too 
bad for white either.];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]
;W[ce];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[hd]C[Eric:  Because of the weaknesses at G15 and J17, G16 is probably 
better than H16.];B[qg];W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[pl];B[jf]
;W[nc]LB[hf:B][dk:C][fo:A]C[Maybe I should of expanded my territory at B 
(H14) C(D9) or A(F5).
I think one of my weaknesses is undertaking audacious invasions instead of 
calmy building territory at the same rate as my opponent. Is this an example 
of that or did I just invade in the wrong manner?

Eric: A, B, and C all look like nice moves.  Your invasion at O17 also seems 
reasonable -- you don't have any other weak groups, black is trying to 
surround an awful lot of territory with just four stones, and black's 
potential to take territory while attacking a stone at O17 is limited -- but 
maybe O17 needs H16 to be at H17 to work well, since black J17 pretty much 
destroys the potential of O17 to connect to G17, and a white response around 
G18 or F18 is gote.  Now, would I see all that ahead of time in a real game? 
  No.  It's easier to say to yourself, "a move that is both an extension and 
an approach is good," than it is to figure out how an invasion will work 
out, which is why I generally don't invade unless it seems necessary.

Another possible invasion is around M4 -- avoid M3 and L4 because they can 
lead to a nice crosscut-protected-by-two-one-point-jumps position for black.]
;B[oc]C[Eric:  I was going to say that I'm not keen on exchanging L17and L18 
for K17 and K18, which creates a shape where black is neatly cutting white 
apart.  But I guess white is already cut apart by the J17 weakness, so maybe 
the exchanges are OK.]

;W[ne];B[pi];W[nh];B[ld];W[lc];B[ge]C[This move revealed how weak my position was it's all down here from 
now.

Eric:  Black's bottom group has the potential to become big, but so does 
white's left group.  Black's top right may end up a lot smaller than it 
looks (see variation).  White's C15 wall is well placed, facing a region 
where a lot of territory can be made.  Finally, there's a running black 
group and a running white group, and it's hard to foresee what will happen 
there.  As it happens, though, this is when black starts making trouble for 
himself.

It's easy for white in particular to lose a few points in the opening 
(though I'll leave it to a stronger player to say definitively who has a 
lead here), but I don't think you should worry about it too much.  A single 
mistake in the middle can have a several times greater effect than a few 
imperfect opening moves combined, and you're not going to find a sure-fire 
plan to improve your position until your opponent makes such a mistake.]

(;W[he]C[Eric:  H15 looks good.];B[gf];W[gd];B[eg];W[hf];B[ei]
C[Eric:  G13 is better than H13 -- it captures more efficiently if 
black decides to sacrifice G14, and if black saves G14, then white can 
follow up with J13 instead if he wants.];W[hg];B[jh];W[gg];B[ff]
C[Eric:  Maybe black should sacrifice G14 instead.]
(;W[fg];B[ef]C[Eric:  Now D14 doesn't work, so the F13/E14 exchange looks like a 
possible mistake for white.  Still, that floating E14 group is ugly, while 
G16 hardly looks to be in danger.]
(;W[gj]C[Eric:  G10 doesn't prevent a connection between E14 and K16 because 
they can't connect anyhow.

If white plays B14 instead, then white has a base and black doesn't.]
;B[bf];W[ae];B[cj]C[Eric:  Now I think the tables have turned in black's favor.  E14 has 
become stronger than E16, but it should not have happened that way.]
;W[jj]C[Eric:  This move pushes the K16 group towards the weak O12 group.  
Maybe extend O12 instead.];B[li];W[ki];B[mg];W[lh];B[ng]C[After some desperate fighting I resign.

Eric:  It's moves like M12 that made things really desperate, but I can 
understand that you didn't want to fight a fairly bad position to the bitter 
end.  I haven't commented on the rest of the game.];W[mf];B[lg]
