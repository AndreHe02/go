C[Readl:
Hi! Thank you for reviewing my game.

I have added a bunch of questions and some alternative ways of playing that I was wondering about after the game was over.

I usually tend to play a very moyo-based game (read: always chinese opening), but this time I wanted to try something different.

-----
Hi Readl,

I'm your reviewer Felix. I added my own variations to answer your questions.
I hope you find them useful. If you have further question, feel free to contact me.

Kind regards,
Felix a.k.a. djifmaster];B[pd];W[dd];B[cp];W[pp]

This move is obviously bad. I don't know why I keep confusing this and when white d16 is at d17.

----
Why is this move "obviously bad"? I think it is fine. If White plays around 'A' you can play at 'B' and build a formation which is known from the Kobayashi fuseki. It is not ideal, because White is in the lower right corner, but it is playable.]
;W[ce]C[This move is not good in my opinion...];B[df];W[fc]
LB[cc:A]C[...Black can still invade at 'A' later to reduce the corner (as you also did in the game).]
;B[cj]LB[fc:2][ce:4][cf:1][df:5][dj:3]C[Readl:
maybe too close to black on the top..?

-----
No, the distance is good. There is a simple rule: extension space equals height of the wall plus 1. In this case 2+1=3. Perfect!
But better to play on fourth line at '3'. Then it would be back to the Kobayashi fuseki formation. (Move order as shown, starting with Black at '1'.) The exchange '4'-'5' is bad for White, because as I said before the corner is still open.]
(;W[cn]LB[ep:A]C[Readl:
This white move made me a bit too happy. Should it be at d6?

-----
Why is this move bad?
This move is bad because White pincers himself and also the bottom is the bigger side. In the opening you should always play in the biggest open area.
So White should approach around 'A'.];B[eo]LB[dp:B][ep:A]C[Often the simple moves, are the better ones.
Playing at 'A' or 'B' is better, because it does not leave behind a cut.]
;W[fq]C[This move exploits the weakness of the small knight's move.]
(;B[co]LB[gp:A]TR[eo]C[If you touch the stone on the left side, you make it stronger. You do not attack it.
Because the intention of the marked black stone was to attack the white stone on the left, it would be more consistent to play 'A'. Please see variation.]

 wasn't sure where to play. it his overly defensive? Is something like L3/L4 a bit better?

-----
The question you have to ask yourself here is: Are the marked stones strong or are they weak?
When you decided this question for yourself, then you should play depending on this answer.

The stones are weak: Defend your group, make it strong first. Play at 'A'.
The stones are strong: Extend from your strength/big wall, make your area of influence as big as possible. Play at 'B'.

The move you played wants to do both but accomplishes little.

See variations.];W[jp]LB[ip:A]C[White's move seems a little unorthodox, but it works and shows, why Black 'A' was wrong.]
;B[iq];W[jq]C[Now White has a perfect formation, Black on the other hand is overconcentrated.]
;B[qn]C[Readl:
same stupid spot for addressing the corner -_- where is the best place to play at this point in the game?

-----
I don't understand, why you think, that this is a stupid move. You have to reflect that for yourself. I can just tell you my opinion. And I can tell you, that this move is very good. High dans and even Pros consider this move as 'the only' approach move to an open star point.]
;W[qo]LB[qq:A]C[This kick does not defend the corner. Black can still invade at 'A' later.]
;B[pn];W[ir]LB[np:A]C[White needs 'A'.];B[hr]LB[op:A]C[Maybe tenuki here is better and play 'A' directly.]
;W[jr]LB[op:A]C[At this point Black should really think about tenuki and playing at 'A' directly.]
;B[gq]C[Black is so overconcentrated. 11 stones for 10 points is painful. Usually endgame moves give you more points.]

;W[qf]
(;B[qe]LB[qd:A][re:B]C[Readl:
Is this the best way to attack white?

-----
In this case it is probably the best move. It tries to make White heavy. 
A simple way to play is 'A'.
'B' is a special move which is sometimes better. But in this case White is strong at the top.]
;W[pf]
(;B[oe]LB[nc:B][nd:A]C[Better to play 'A' or 'B' here. The diagonal move only leaves behind a cut. This means Black has to be careful when fighting. 'A'/'B' are simple and solid.]

(;B[qi]LB[lc:3][of:A][mi:2][rl:1]C[The block seems natural. On the other hand, Black cannot expect much territory in area '1'. Big potential is in areas '2' and '3'. See variation.]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[rg];B[kc]LB[nd:B][od:A]TR[oe]C[Readl:
 L17 looks too low. maybe L6 was better? :/

-----
The extension has a proper distance. The problem here is, that you want to have the marked stone at either 'A' or 'B']
;W[sd];B[sc];W[se]LB[rc:A][od:B]C[To defend the cut at 'A' is necessary. Especially with the second cut at 'B', White can make things happen there. Also, the corner is the biggest territory you have at the moment. So you should protect.]
;B[gf]LB[rc:A][fe:B]C[Defending the cut at 'A' is bigger.
Locally the move at 'B' is better, because it activates more aji in the corner and has better follow up moves.]
;W[ic];B[kd]LB[id:B][je:A][ke:C]C[Your move is very solid.
But playing 'A' to 'C' makes your potential territory bigger.]

this feels like it leaves white with a ko in the future. Is there a better spot to hit?

-----

You should think about surrounding groups first. Therefore a move at 'A' is better.
If White has to live in gote, you should be very happy, because you get to play another big spot.]
;W[lh];B[lj];W[kg];B[jh];W[kh]LB[jh:1][kh:2]C[This exchange, 1 for 2, is very bad for you, because you take your own liberties. Just play it as a ko threat or during endgame]

is this black the correct move? It feels a bit slow, but it also feels like it makes it hard for white to come up with a good follow-up.

This move is perfectly fine. I think it is the biggest move on the board. Since you started to play a diagonal fuseki the game is usually more territorial. The shimari is territory orientated, so it is good. Also White played both moves at the star point, so no hurry to approach them. White cannot enclose the corners with one move as you did with this one.]
