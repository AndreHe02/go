C[Hi there mighty reviewer! Thank you for your time! My colour is WHITE and i SUCK at this game!

Hi Francesco,

I'm sorry, I can't give you many advices for the opening, as my opening isn't good enough neither. All in all you did a good job during the game. Black recognized that he had no chance and fled.

To answer your question, whether 9x9 or 19x19 is better for learning: 9x9 is useful to learn the rules. But it won't teach you strategy, which is necessary to win a 19x19. 

I hope, my hints are helpful, though I didn't see really bad mistakes.

Best regards
Timm];B[fe]C[F5: seems a bit ambitious move.];W[dg]C[My standard system, a.k.a. get in the opening two stones in a set up similar or specular to d-3; c-6

Worked quite well during my sessions with te pc (i played against a computer opponent "many faces of go").

In the real life I don't know what to do after some opponent moves, especially if he attach]

I think you're right, as it is on you to defend. I don't know if I count right, but you two sourround nearly the same number of points and white has 6.5 komi. So why should you attack?]
;B[de];W[ce];B[dc]C[another move that puzzles me

This was a weak move. Your answer was correct.];W[dd]C[i answer trying to threaten or the stone which attached or the two stones in the middle]
;B[ed];W[cc]C[I threaten the black stone, maybe I will caputre it, maybe it will buy me some times to manouver with my eastmost white]

(;W[cb]C[I think my opponent made an error here, he should have left the stone to its destiny and played something around the lines of E2]
;B[fb]C[another useless move

I don't neither know what black tried. If he wanted to keep you away from his territory in the upper right, he should have done it instead of playing D7 at move 13.]
;W[da];B[dh];W[eh]C[that (i must admit) was a mouse slip.

After clicking it it seems a good combination that will (at least) gain me a stone prisoner]
;B[fh];W[ef]C[that's the idea]
(;B[fg]C[i don't know why he chose that, now he will lose 2 pieces

Trying to rescue the two stones was dangerous (see alternative 2). But black should have captured E2.]
;W[ee];B[ch]C[again he will lose a stone. On purpose?];W[fd]

(;W[ed]C[I don't want to weaken mi position on the cross, am I right or should I have taken some appropriate action on the bottom of the board?

This one is not important, as you don't earn extra-points here. So I would try F4 to get some of black's points.]
;B[ff];W[bh]C[i try to stop my opponent];B[bg]C[he cuts.... Wrong cut? Good cut?

No, too late (as your answer shows).];W[bf]C[This is the end of the match (my oppoent... well, he just fleed.

Any comment & critique on my game is very appreciated, expecially in the opening moves.

Thank you in advance!])
