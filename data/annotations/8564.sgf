C[Hello Hakan. My name is Greg Cole. If you have any question about he review or in general, feel free to email me at gtc.cole@gmail.com. For this review I will prefix any comments with GC.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[dd];W[pd];B[nq];W[fc]C[GC: As a note, it's not common to ingore an approach to the 4-4 point. The reason being is that the double approach is more powerful against the 4-4 then against the other opening moves like the 3-4 or 3-5.]
;B[cf];W[jd];B[qj];W[qh]C[i prefered this side. the plan was: b will go down to R7, w will pincer at M3, b will invade at R3, w will build a wall to attack R10-R7 stones.

after game during review, my opponent said R12 should be better at R13. his reasoning is as follows: after a b invasion around O17, w needs a move to defence the link between Q16 and R12. Q14 feels over concentrated and P12 does not actually defend the link.

if R12 at R13, no such move is required and w can use the move to attack O17 invader.

I agree his reasoning but not sure if this makes R12 wrong. R12 is both an extension and meant to make pressure on R10. R13 wont apply such pressure on R10. what do you think?

GC: I think I prefer R12. Your stone at Q4 is going to become weaker through any move you play around R12/13. So its better for now to try and keep black's  R10 group weaker, and the pincer accomplishes that well for now. You should not worry about O17. If black invades with that without much more preparation, he will not have time to play R/Q14. You'll likely naturally fix it just by attacking him.

GC: I do however think that M3 wil be a problem. There is no guarantee of black playing R3. I would playing O5 after a pincer almost without thinking. Then you have two very weak groups and so you'll have trouble later in the game.

GC: If you want to guarantee the wall, the better move is O4. See variations.]

(;B[fq]C[surprisingly he didn't invade corner at R3 here.

later he said, he didn't want the wall so left situation as it's. we thought instead of entering the corner, O5 seems very nice here.]
;W[np]C[seemed urgent as b didn't answer pincer

GC: For sure];B[nc]C[w was happy black invaded here. he entered white's sphere of influence. w should gain something from this

GC: As a note here. I might not have played P17 here but Q17. P17 is a little stronger for the attack but Q17 patches up the corner and Q14 becomes an attacking and territorialy large move.]
(;W[oc];B[nd]
(;W[oh]C[this doesn't feel right but not sure what to play here.

Q14 seems over concentrated, Q13 feels like a bot off-topic of attack

GC: I would play Q14. Its not really overconcetrated.];B[ke]
(;W[lc]C[I guess this should better be at L16

GC: I would probably pla K15. Go for the influence. But no matter what, P12 instead of Q14 was an issue.]
;B[ld];W[kc];B[je];W[hd]C[B left upper side as it's. I think this was a mistake

GC: It is a little slow, but unfortunately necessary. Your groups are too weak to fight otherwise.]

(;W[cb]C[game still seemed close so white urged to take some other big points. but i'm afraid it's to early for this move

GC: I like D9. I might also try play C3 as a probe. R2 is still also very big.]
;B[ek];W[dj];B[fi]C[re-evaluating, i missed what b is doing here. besides chasing left white group he is also trying to make territory in center]

;W[gh]C[i wanted H12 and J11 stones connected. and this move seemed a good way of it. it solidifies connection of left and upper white groups. helps H12-J11 connection as w now can capture J12.]
;B[ji];W[ig];B[jh]C[At this stage, I think black is ahead on point. I would try something a littler more interesting here.]

;W[de];B[ce]C[white resigned here

GC: I think the big issue was how you handled O17 to me. I would say P12 is the losing move. It cost you too much later. Its better to play a maybe a little slow/overconcentrated and play catch up later than to leave huge weaknesses while trying to attack because it simply does not work. If you have questions please let me know.]
