C[> Hi! Thanks for submitting the game. It was a good one to review. Although there aren't many positive comments, you played like a solid 1k and didn't make any serious mistakes. White won because he played more adventurously and your play wasn't quite sharp enough to counter that. There are two main things to look out for.

The first is shape. There were quite a few moves where your shape was inefficient (or sometimes even positively harmful), which loses quite a few points. A good way to practice this is to watch some high dan players play online, paying attention to where their moves in an area differ from what you would have played there. (Pro games are good too, but pros tend to deviate from textbook shape more often than not, which is only helpful if you know the "correct" move to begin with!)

The second point is that you're not aggressive enough. More generally, your play is locally good but lacks a feel for how the game is going to go in the future, so you don't see how a single pincer or weak group can change the flow of the game, even if it doesn't gain an immediate advantage. Threats and attacks gain a lot over simple big moves, so you should try to play in an active way wherever possible.

A good way to develop this feel is to review your own games (or high dan games) and try to spot strategic turning points, which is much easier with the benefit of hindsight! Ask questions like "How was this wall used later?", "What did this attack gain altogether?", "Did this cut turn out to be significant?", and so on.

The game was still well played by both :) If you have any questions, please feel free to email me, or just say hi on KGS (I'm "sixsix"). Enjoy!

(;B[ob]C[>This is good shape, but a bad move. Understanding why this is a mistake will make you stronger! I've put in a few variations to have a look at.

The biggest problem is that it misses an opportunity. Black needs to cut here and fight. The corner is alive without this move.]

(;W[nb]
(;B[oc]C[>Should be Q18. This move loses liberties and actually means that b will have trouble cutting anywhere any more, despite all white's cutting points, because his own shape in the corner is bad.]
;W[nc]
(;B[nq]C[> The shape in the top right is horribly unfinished. It should feel very strange to play anywhere but in the top right! Unfortunately black has filled up his own liberties so there isn't anything he can do. Also, there's nothing w can do to the corner. Therefore tenuki is actually not bad, but the aji up there should always be on your mind.]

Without komi, I think black is about 10-20 points behind; check yourself and see if you agree. This isn't a large amount, especially as there's a lot to be claimed in the centre, but black's floating centre group is going to hinder him while w has no weaknesses.

A good game! As I said, feel free to email or catch me on KGS.]
