(;B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[pe];B[qb]LB[jc:A][rf:B]C[generally when white's 5 is not at A(k17), black always wants to play B(s14) instead of 12, because:

1. white's 5 emphasizes on influence of the center rather than the territory of the upper side, later black can invade into this area relatively easily even without the assistance of black's 12.

2. black can get sente.];W[og]LB[rf:A][pf:B][qg:C]C[normally when black plays 12 instead of A(s14), white will move its 13 to B(q14) correspondingly.

if white can get C(r13) later, it will be quite thick.];B[jp]
LB[re:A]C[black's kenuki at 14 leaves white's serious attack at A(s15).]
;W[cn];B[cj]C[good point with two goals.];W[en];B[fp];W[dk]
C[not good. this move can only make white's 15 group a little strong while black's upper-left quite thick.]
;B[dj];W[cc]C[because of black's 20, the invasion at A(c12) misses, and black will get a lot of territory with only one move at the upper-left corner.]
;B[dc];W[cd]LB[db:A]C[white's 23 is not good, and it should be A(d18) instead. the explaination is at move 31.]
;B[ce];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[be];B[bf];W[bd]C[black's outside is much thicker than it should be.

let us compare this result with the normal step.

(see variation please.)]
(;B[bl]LB[co:A][cq:B][cp:C][dq:D][fk:E][ej:F][gm:G]C[it is good that black's 32 is aiming at get rid of white's base, but i am afraid black should play A(c5) to protect its corner and test white's reply first.   otherwise white would have the choice to invade into the corner at B(c3) to suggest an exchange if black answers at C(c4), or make a living base if black D(d3).  Anyway, white's 15,17 and 19 group can not be captured as a whole easily, for it is light and flexible, which induces several ways to dodge black's attack with either E(f9), F(e10) or G(g7). but when it flees, black will suffer from short of territory.

(followed please find the illustrations.)]
(;W[eq]C[correct direction.];B[ep];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq]
(;B[fq]LB[bq:A]C[i prefer A(b3) here, for black's 38 gives white too much of territory in the corner.

(see variation please.)];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fr];B[gr]
;W[er];B[ej]LB[fk:A]C[i am afraid black's 46 is a little slow, it can make a bigger step to attack white's left group as a whole at A(f9).]
;W[gn]LB[hm:A]C[i think white should have gone into the center more trippingly, say at A(h7).

the part capture of white's 15 group is not so important, for white has already obtained profit in the lower-left corner.   the goal to escape ALL of the white's left stones correspondingly suffers the serious danger that they may have been captured AS A WHOLE.]
;B[jn];W[gk];B[hi];W[qn]LB[ik:A]C[i am afraid white should have continued to play in the left, probably at A(j9); its big group does not make alive yet.]

(;B[np]LB[hm:A]C[i prefer black's kenuki in the lower-right and attack white starting with A(h7).

(see variations please.)];W[io];B[jo];W[hp];B[ir]LB[hq:A]C[i am afraid A(h3) is thicker and connects the bottom.]
;W[gq]LB[bn:A]C[perhaps white can test black's answer with A(b6) first.]
;B[hq];W[gp];B[bn];W[rp]LB[qq:A][rf:B][rh:C][iq:E][ik:D]C[locally A(r3) instead of white's 61 is preferred, for the corner is bigger. and if black gets B(s14) later, its follower-up move at C(s12) can be expected, which make it hardly for white to gain territory along the right side.

but of all the board, the lower-left white group is still the bigest. white should have fleed out with D(j9), and please note that there is aji at E(j3).]
;B[ip];W[qq]C[greedy i think. under black's following attack, even if white can make alive while tightly enclosed, black's outside thickness will surely compensate the loss in the corner.]
;B[ik]C[the capture/escape fighting starts!

the moves in the center are always the most complicated that one can not read all of them out for us amateurs.

anyway, no matter white's group is captured or not, this game will turn to black when it gets 64. as i said above, "always try to not be enclosed", which may be a kind of principle of go, i think. at this point of view, we do not emphasize on life or death, but the influence or thickness in the center, which will help the later fight and make territory at last.
