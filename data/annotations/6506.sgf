C[I found blacks opening strange, so I didn't know how to respond. Could you help me with this?

Thank you for taking the time to review my game.

A: First of all, let me say I'm no pro, so anything I say about a game's opening is dubious. That said, I was impressed with your early opening. I think that many people, seeing Black's strong and slow framework forming, would feel compelled to invade it. You instead played calm, framework building moves.

The difficulties came for you in the middlegame fighting.  (I've a shape note I'd like you to remember in a variation on move one)

I've prefixed all my comments with "A".]
(;B[cq];W[pd];B[dp]SQ[cn][dn]C[A: Black is slow here. The usual idea is to play at one of the marked points, giving you an enclosure. Even the enclosure at this point I would not be happy with, since white could next take the corner the enclosure was facing.

Another way to think about it: say you already had played the 4-4 point, would the 3-3 be the way you'd develop it? Either way, you are being slow.]

[go][io][jp][aq][bq][kr][ks]C[A: Black has secured maybe 40 points, and has a strong wall, but you have:

1) An enclosure in one corner, mitigating that face of his wall
2) Two other corners with your flag in them
3) A nice framework on the right side.

Maybe with P10 I would have played on the left side to mitigate that facing of his/her wall, but I think your opening so far was a very strong response to a series of moves you'd probably not thought about before.]
;B[gl];W[cj]C[A: This might be too close for comfort to Black's wall. Looking at variations, I came up with no definitive proof of this. But it feels like Black is SO strong here, that s/he should be able to abuse you. Not sure though.]
;B[ek];W[di];B[cl];W[jc]C[A: I'd go back and do something with C10 and D11 at this point, they are flush against a black wall at the moment.]
;B[mp];W[oo];B[fi];W[eg];B[fg];W[eh];B[df]SQ[eg][fg]C[A: When your opponent gives you a shape that is already half cut, you very often want to take it (see variation)]

(;W[cf];B[cd]C[This courner fight starting here ends badly on my part. What do you think would be the best approach?]
;W[cc];B[bc]
(;W[bd];B[ce];W[de];B[be];W[bf];B[ad];W[dc];B[cb];W[af];B[ae]

(;W[ab];B[bb];W[db]C[A: Staying connected is worth more than sealing off the corner. As far as the coming fight is concerned, once you read a situation out and decide you have to lose something, commit to it. Use moves that force your opponent to capture to get stones in places that benefit you, and move on. (see comment later on)]
;B[ef];W[ff];B[ee];W[fe];B[ed];W[fd];B[ec];W[eb]C[A: Hurts your outside shape, and gives Black more to gobble.]
;B[fc];W[gc];B[fb];W[fh];B[cg]
(;W[gg]C[A: Good. The fight went badly, but this connects your stones together and cuts your losses. (See variation, though)]

LB[pc:B][qc:A][pe:C]C[If you get attached to like this, I'd say the general advice would be to either hane at A or extend.

This will be my last large comment. I think that this was a good game but you got the short end of the stick in the middlegame fighting. My advice (take with several grains of salt):

1) Practice fighting. Maybe invade someday where you were doing to reduce, or cut where you were going to just push/connect. Have fun with it :).
2) Focus on connections: Cut where you are relatively strong, connect when you are relatively weak. 

Was the time limit on this game really 10 minutes sudden death? Fast play is fun, but if you want to play to get better, you need to leave yourself time to concider moves beyond the "gut feeling" moves you make in a fast game. I'm not saying you SHOULD be playing for improvement, because you should play the go that is fun for you. If your goal is advancement, though, give yourself some more time.

To respond to your final question, yes, you were behind by a significant margin without many prospects of big fights or other things to turn your way.]

C[HarryH has run out of time.

Black ran out of time, but if he didn't I should have resigned, right?]
)
(;B[oe];W[nd];B[re]C[A: Seems like it comes out better for Black to atari first, since he's abandoned those stones anyway.]
))
(;W[gb];B[dg];W[gg]C[A: Seals the upper side a little better, in sente. If you are going to lose stones, you can often get stones in good places.

If the forcing moves don't profit you, though, don't play 'em. Save 'em for ko threats.]
))
(;W[db];B[bb]C[A: If you want to close off the corner, this way keeps sente to grab that troublesome D14 stone.]
))
(;W[ce]SQ[cd][dd][cf][df]C[A: Again, the marked cross cut shape tends to make me want to be the cutter rather than cut-ee.]

(;B[ei]C[A: Even if you play fairly passively here, just connecting, Black cannot do too much damage on this side.]
)
(;B[cb]C[A: Black will still likely live in the corner, this way, but you are connected on the outside and have the option to capture the D14 stones in gote later.]
)))
(;W[ef]C[A: When you can cut without being crosscut, life is good.]
))
(;B[tt];AW[jj]AB[ij][kk]LB[jk:B][kk:A]C[Just a shape note to think about:

If black plays A in this shape, giving you a formation that is already half cut, B is the move you should concider first.]
;W[jk]C[Black's move looks like it induced you to make a good move, while weakening black on both sides.]
