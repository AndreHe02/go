C[This game has been very close all the time, smooth if not boring.
And because of this, I am absolutely uncertain to estimate where my mistakes lay.

----------------
This was a very quiet game, so it's hard to point out anything very major. Since it was so close, however, that also means there are plenty of opportunities where just a few points could be the difference between win and lose. I'll try to hit the key ones that would have made the most difference in this game.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[cq];W[pq]TR[po][qo]C[----------------
Your two best approach moves are these. Preventing the shimari is big, and you should be able to build up the right side and threaten a large territory due to the position of R16. White may choose to pincer but you have stones to each side and as long as you don't make a second weak group, you should see opportunity to counter-attack.

It may feel that something like O3 sets up to build territory on the bottom, but C3 and O3 are so low that it is difficult for them to expand a lot. And in this scenario, R16 is there to help you, too.]

(;B[nq]C[----------------
This move is a little too quiet. It's something you see more against a Chinese style fuseki where coming in from the front of the 3-4 is dangerous. Here you have the support in the form of R16 to come from the front. Preventing a shimari is a large play at any stage of the game.]
;W[qo];B[kq]TR[cq][nq]C[----------------
You may want to think about moving this a line higher, these three stones create a very low position all strung out on the third line, it's hard for them to expand much as a result.]
;W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[dq];W[fp];B[eq];W[gn];B[oc]TR[cn][gq]C[--------------------
They are sort of miai, but be aware of these points. C6 is important to undermine white's left side potential. G3 is important because it can provide needed support to the L3 stones. P17's shimari is large, but either of these is quite large also, I'd play C6 personally. If white gets F3, you may need to begin rescuing the L3 stones, which gives white a chance to close up at C5, getting both major points in the lower left.]

C[------------------
The difference in points as marked. Here you gain 3 points (two prisoners + O7), the other route gains you no points, but white loses about 7 in prisoners and points he has to close up.]

;B[ac];W[ad];B[bb];W[op]C[------------------
Don't let yourself get pushed around in yose, especially not in a close game. There are fewer points to defend in the upper point of this territory than below. P2 is a valuable reverse sente move that affords you than blocking O4 in gote and giving up all of your Q2 area. The score estimator is always rough, but you can see the difference in the variation's territory with it.]

(;B[np];W[or];B[nr];W[ps]LB[al:A][km:C][ns:B]C[------------------
Focus on these points, the capture is small, and ends in gote or stays as ko giving white the chance to simply take the point back. 

A is a rather large sente yose move, you should probably play this right away.
B is reverse sente, but prevents white from attempting a ko or geting a pretty large sente of his own.
C is also sente and sets up some other forcing moves on white.]

Looks like you guys missed these. Each is a worth a point and combined with getting even just another of the sente yose points like A8 could have spelled the difference.]

The opening and middlegame were as you said, rather reserved and quiet for both. No major captures territory swings for either player. That also means that yose becomes a large part. The closer the game, the more crucial it is to slow down and look for those plays that save or squeeze just a few extra points out. 

In particular, find all the plays that you are sure end in sente for you, and play them first. As many as you can. They may only be worth a few points each but the pile up very fast. Don't be afraid to take a large reverse sente or gote either, defending is as important in attacking.

Quite a close game, you did well; you just have to be a bit more wary about building yourself in the fuseki and really work on seeing those yose points. Don't get caught up locally.

Good luck, I hope this helps you in the future!])

White can attempt to start a ko, but he stands to lose more than you in it. You can also connect at Q1 and take sente to play somewhere else and still have a net gain from R1.]
