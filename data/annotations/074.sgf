[jlee]BR[2k]PW[cd]WR[2k*];VW[]B[qd]N[cd-jlee(B) IGS]C[ Hi, Joongul Lee

I tried to give variations where ever I thought they might be useful.
I didn't restrict myself to comments on black moves only, because
sometimes a white move provided teaching material as well, ok?

Hope it's what you expected,

(;B[de]C[Black could choose for a quiet line as well, variation "quiet  line".]
;W[ce]
(;B[dd]C[This could lead to complicated lines, black could play simpler
 with line B. It is not bad at all, by the way, to play nadare joseki
 here (d16).];W[cd];B[ec]
(;W[cf]C[White has a choice here, see variation B (small nadare).];B[df]
;W[cb]L[dg]C[This is a strange move. Normal would be to play at "A".]
;B[db]C[Good.];W[cc];B[dg]C[Good, keypoint of this shape (it creates liberties and prevents
 a hane on three stones).]
(;W[eb]C[Bad again, white already lives in the corner so no need to
 capture here. Actually, white spoils a much better follow-up move
 (later on). See variation "follow-up".];B[fb];W[da];B[fc]C[Good, a solid move, finishes black's shape here.]

(;W[qo]C[The upper-edge might be more urgent now, variation "upper-edge".]
;B[pl]M[fp]L[no][mq]C[Good move again. Black plays the opening very well so far.
 The reason why q8 is a good move is: 1. it builds the top; 2. it 
induces  white "A", black "B", the latter move would slightly damage 
the marked  white stone (as explained earlier).]
(;W[qq]C[Rather unusual in this shape. More normal would be to play
 like in variation "quicker".];B[qr];W[pp]
(;B[rq]C[A normal line, but also following the main line would have
 been good for black: variation "main line".];W[oq];B[qp];W[pr];B[qq]
(;W[op]C[Wrong shape, better to play variation "shape".];B[po]C[A severe move!]

(;W[pn]L[pm]C[Too direct, maybe better "A". For example variation "more
 efficient".];B[oo];W[qm]L[on][ro]M[pl]C[Bad shape because of black moves at "A", or "B". The marked 
stone is exactly at the vital point of white's shape. It's not easy 
to find better lines though.];B[ql]C[A cool answer, building up the upper-right side. White is 
in trouble here.];W[on];B[no]
(;W[mp]C[Bad shape again because of the cut option at "A" for black. 
What's better shape? variation "shape".];B[ro]C[Extremely painful for white.]
;W[qn];B[np];W[nq];B[mq]C[Severe cut again, white is almost loosing the game here...]
;W[mr];B[lq];W[lp]C[Oops, I didn't see this move coming! Black trouble now.]
;B[nn];W[nm];B[lo];W[kp]L[kq]C[Bad, better take a firm grip on the two black stones with  "A".]
;B[ln];W[kq];B[om]C[Although white got territory because of the premature black  cut, black gains a lot here.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[qk]L[ok]C[Nice try, but bad aji-keshi actually. A better move locally  is white "A" (later on).]
;B[pk];W[od]L[nc]C[Maybe better at "A" to prevent black's next move.]
;B[mc]C[Severe on white.];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd];B[oc];W[nc];B[nd];W[nb];B[qb]
;W[rc];B[ob];W[oa];B[pb];W[mb]C[Although white would like to settle along the upper-edge,  this move is unreasonable here, see variation "the ladder".]

(;B[qe]

;W[dr];B[co]C[Black lost a tempo here, compared with the variation previously shown.]
;W[bi]L[ch][cm]C[This is a very strange move, either "A", or "B". This move 
doesn't "exist".];B[ck]C[Now black is settled and white b11 is left too low.]
;W[he];B[ch];W[bh];B[ci]C[Black hurries to connect, a simple way, but slightly too submissive. 
The upper-left is not that weak.];W[bj];B[bk];W[pf];B[pe];W[oi]C[Right, white has to do something, otherwise he will loose.]
;B[qj];W[mi]C[Well done by white.];B[nh];W[ni]

See variation: "attack".];W[pi];B[qg];W[ph];B[pg];W[mh];B[me];W[mg];B[og]

at "B", or damage white with "C".];W[kf];B[kg];W[lg];B[jf];W[lf];B[hg];W
