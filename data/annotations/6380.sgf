C[Hey there,

Thank you for reviewing my game. After I lost the fight in the middle, I tried desperately to come back, but it didn't work out so well. I've included my reasoning on the moves I made.

I'd appreciate any comments you have.

Thank you =)

- Derek

*hello derek, i preface my comments with *

in general, your style is better than white's, but you dont pay enough attention to your linkages]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[eq];W[dq];B[ep];W[dn];B[hp]C[* J3  rule of thumb: skip 3 paces from a 2-stone wall, etc

this moves leaves a hole inderneath, white can probe at, say, K3 and neutralise the lower side]
;W[kq];B[mq];W[iq];B[hq];W[ko]C[*K5 more solid];B[jp];W[kp]
;B[jq];W[jr]C[*thoughtless];B[ir];W[jo];B[ip];W[im]C[Here I didn't want to be shut in, so I tried to jump out.

*O5 would press b down as well as jumping out];B[fm];W[fn]C[*overplay.  C8 better]
;B[gn];W[fo];B[gp]C[*H7 better];W[gm]C[Here I decided to set up a place to run to before playing the atari.

* the atari?  we are still in fuseki and you are thinking about endgame moves]
;B[de]C[*good];W[cg]C[*good];B[ec]C[*bad
look at the size of the white left !

black has to invade at around E10 or somewhere before the left side becomes solid wite territory]
;W[dd];B[ed];W[ce]C[*good];B[df];W[cf];B[gl]C[*bad

if w joins, and black joins, black will have 3 floating stones in the middle.  by threatening these, white will be able to soldify the large left side]
;W[hm];B[fk];W[em];B[gi]C[*good to skip lightly way but a jump into C9 would be more effective]
;W[oc]C[Wanted to make a moyo on top, so I pincered.];B[mc]
;W[qc];B[od]C[*this looks greedy.  as white i would turn at O16 and hope to build some strength from which to jump into to either the top or the right

if making a moyo on the top is your plan, O15 instead of P16 would be consistent]
;W[rd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[nb];B[mb];W[pc]C[all the last few moves were small-scale thinking]
;B[jd];W[qo];B[lr]LB[ck:A][kk:C][ql:B]TR[qp]C[I think R4 would have been better. I wanted to make a base while threatening to connect; but just corner would be alive anyway.

* your move is ok but small.  ABC are alternatives];W[ql];B[rp]
LB[ok:A]TR[qi]C[Mistake. Should have been R11.

* or A];W[ro]C[* very slow, b can ignore];B[qp];W[qi];B[ph]
LB[lh:A]C[Building moyo

* not really, it is wide open at A];W[qh];B[pi];W[pj];B[ni]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[nk]LB[jj:A]C[* too slow.  A better];B[mk];W[nl]
;B[cj];W[ee]LB[fe:A]C[I didn't see this cut at all.

* it looks like an overplay.  i would consider playing A etc, sacrificing 2 stones, and making the centre moyo very solid]
;B[fe];W[ef];B[ff];W[dg];B[gd];W[oi];B[oh];W[nh]LB[li:B][mj:A]
C[* overplay again. white has a double attack on the cut stones, but both should survive

i would respond with A or B];B[pg]LB[of:A]C[*empty triangles are almost always bad.  if you cant read it out, play safe with a solid move like A]
;W[mh];B[lj]LB[li:A][mj:B]C[*this lokks ok, but it causes b problems.  A or B work better]
;W[li]C[*nice forcing move];B[mj];W[kj]LB[ki:A]C[*another  fighting move. but i think b can reply at A - see variation]

(;B[kk];W[jj];B[jk];W[ik]LB[ij:A]C[*A seems obvious, but does it work?]

(;B[ij];W[ii]
(;B[hj]C[*after this move, w has more liberties than b];W[jl]
C[* i cant see any way for b to evade capture from here];B[ki]
;W[ji];B[kh]
(;W[ml];B[lh]C[*blunder];W[mi]C[I didn't see this was atari.]
;B[mg];W[ng];B[nf];W[lk]LB[lg:B][kr:A]TR[mf]TW[de][df][ni][lj]
[mj][nj][mk]C[How far apart is the score right now?

I felt like I had to make some huge overplays to try to catch up; since my mid-left moyo is basically destroyed and my right mid moyo is full of holes.

*rough count:
white
top left 21
top right 13
bottom left 16
centre right 33
prisoners 7
total 90

black
left 6
bottom, assuming b A 31
upper centre 36
total 73

difference 17

not too big, but the weakness at B makes it impossible to recover.
