C[Hello, dear reviewer.
In this game I played white and lost by resign. Now I think, that my main problem was abandoning to protect my weak groups... but in the game I was unable to see, that they are really weak. So I'll be grateful about any advices about middle-game fights.
There are some questions and thoughts in the game, but feel free to coment wherever you find my mistakes.

Thank you very much in advance for help!

/Igor'

Hello =)

I'll try my best analysing your game. I'm about 2d+ kgs, but as you can guess, that's far from perfection (very far), so I'll try to be as sure as possible of what I say. 

You asked for advices for middle-game fights, so I'll put a summary here from what I've seen in this game:

- Don't play bad shape, aji-keshi moves or bad forcing moves :
    in this game, you played a few of those moves, and they put you in a hard situation, try keeping the aji (for instance j13, f17, or more importantly, L10 !)

- If you have a weak group, play solidly (c6)

- Read more and better (well, that's obviously true for everybody, but still) (f17,l10)

Was it better just to play q14?

It depends on your plan, I really don't know =( it looks playable, though

Or what is the right way for white to play?

l17 is the  right way out, but it's still very painfull. Blame r17 =D]
;B[lf];W[kf];B[lh];W[gd]C[Now I see, that I was too aggressive here. White is too thin to attack.
Was it better to play j18 or j14 instead?

Yes, indeed =) Those moves are better ideas];B[jd];W[kd];B[if]
;W[jg];B[ee]LB[ig:A][ji:B]C[R:
Which direction is better ? Do you want to give black the whole left, and let the o17 unpressured ? Or do you want to keep the left open and slightly pressure o17 ?

You asked for advices for middle game fighting, well, one of the best thing you can do, apart from improving your reading (which is the advice for just about everyone in the world), is to play good shapes. It's amazing how good shapes make game easier]

It's very hard to kill that white, although I would avoid things like e19 for white

But even though it's complicated, c17 looks very natural, whereas f17 was really forcing and not so hard to read. To improve this => tsumegos =D

(;B[qc]C[The problem with your move, is that when black gets into the corner, the natural follow-up is q17, because if white r16, l17 would be better placed at m17. The reason one plays l17, is to make the extention at h17 more natural later, and to avoid black jumping at o16. 

But still, you'd be able to make a good looking moyo, so I don't think it's really bad. You didn't lose because of l17, that's for sure]
