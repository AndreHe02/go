C[I lost by a lot, the cut at the left side was big, but I think there should be more fails.. Please, help me out

Hagios: There are quite a few strange moves and mistakes in this game.  I'll do my best to offer good ways to think for both players.]
;B[pd];W[pp]C[Jelad [6k\]: hi gg
Dr1 [6k\]: gg];B[cd];W[dp];B[cn];W[go]C[H: This move bewilders me.  I don't think that a player of any skill will be confused by this move.  I would dive in to the cover without a second thought.]
(;B[dj]C[H: Black was absolutely committed to this Kobayashi opening, no matter what W does.  Only the first move is allowed to ignore your opponent's position.  After the second stone is on the board, you MUST react to your opponent's play.  If your opponent plays a strange move, sticking to a strategy without regard for the overall position is a quick way to lose.]
;W[ic]LB[gc:B][kc:A]C[H: This is a sensible move by W.  B should attack immediately, once he committed to his strategy.]
(;B[qn]C[H: This move feels like it lacks some whole-board perspective.  It makes me feel somewhat uneasy.]
;W[np];B[pj]C[H: Is hard to find any major mistakes here, but overall, I feel uneasy about this position.]
;W[ec]C[H: This move makes perfect sense.  Black feels a bit slack now.]
(;B[df];W[pg];B[nc];W[qj];B[qk];W[pk]C[the result here was bad for me I think.. how could I do over here?

H: I have a hard time feeling unhappy with this position.  The first player has the advantage in a cross-cut fight.]
(;B[pi];W[qi];B[ql];W[ph]C[H: This ladder, sadly, is NOT good.  That makes things harder for black.]

;W[kq];B[ip]LB[eq:B][iq:A][jq:C]C[H: I have a difficult time accepting this move.  B feels weak and attackable now, and W has some nice cash by attacking already.  I'd consider A, B, or C isntead.]

C[H: Black is drastically behind by now.  This is a lost game.  If white plays normally, black will lose even without making any more mistakes.]

H: I've heard a term that I believe Yilun Yang coined: "Nice trying."  If faced with a loss by losing a do or die invasion, versus a loss by inaction, clearly you should at least try to win--or else resign.]
