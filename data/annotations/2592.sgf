C[Hello,

This is a game between White inimino[12k\], and I Black slade[14k\]. This game was played on kgs and it involves a large fight that spans most of the board. Here are some of the things I would like answered:

For White:
White makes some mistakes in killing black what were they?

For Black:
Black was forced into a fight that really was in benefit for white. How could of black stopped this fight to begin with?

And of course any other comments are welcome.

Thanks in advance,

C[Should  White prefer C14 over F17?
Are there other moves that are better than either?];W[fc];B[dj]
;W[cf]
(;B[ee]C[The opening moves have been quite reasonable so far.  Playing this move at F16 is doable, but I'm not sure it's any better than this move.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eo]TR[dj][ee]C[At this point, I'd prefer D13 to connect the marked stones and contain the white stone. Even if white attacks the stone at D4, I think that stone can live or get out.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[cl]
(;B[ci]C[I think black should push through at C9.  You should be able to separate the white stones and weaken one side or the other.]
;W[dl]
(;B[dh];W[pk]TR[cj][cl][dl][cn]C[White left the fight on the left a little early since the marked stones are not secure.]
;B[eq];W[cq];B[fp];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[hc];W[qo];B[ec];W[eb]
;B[bc]C[Maybe connecting at e16 would have been better?

Yes.  White might live, but at least black is solid.];W[bb]
;B[bd];W[ed];B[gd]C[Protecting the cut at D15 is more important.  Either D15 or D14 would be better moves here.]
;W[ef]C[What is the best move for black here?

Definitely D15 would be better than the move played.]
(;B[ff]C[Looks like a black mistake maybe d15 instead?

Yes, see variations.];W[de]C[Now it's going to be more of a struggle for black.]
;B[fe];W[eg]
(;B[cg]TR[bc][bd][cd][dd]C[B plays on the wrong side and lets W capture the four marked stones.  See variation.]
;W[bf];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[dr]
(;B[er]TR[cn][cl][dl][cj]C[B could capture at B3 (see var.). This would threaten the marked stones.]
;W[aq]C[This should probally be W B2.];B[br];W[fr];B[ds];W[iq]
;B[jq];W[co];B[bq];W[ip];B[io];W[ho]C[Here starts a fight the result of this fight starts the huge fight. Maybe something can be done here to prevent that fight?

It might be better for B to not try so hard to kill the W stones here.  If B can live in the center at the bottom and split W's two week groups in the lower left, he may gain more.  See variations.]

(;B[hp];W[gp];B[hq];W[ir]
(;B[go]C[B can push down at H2 (see var.) and capture the three stones on line J.]
;W[hn];B[hr];W[jr];B[kr];W[jo];B[in];W[kq];B[kp];W[lr]
(;B[lq]C[L1 it probably better -- see var.];W[ks]
(;B[mr]TR[ip][iq][ir][jr]C[Connecting at L3 looks like bad shape for B, but W is too weak to take advantage of it so B can still capture the key stones (marked) -- see var.

Starting a ko here is unnecessary.];W[kq]
(;B[mp]C[maybe the solid connection at m4 is better?

That doesn't work very well after a W move at O2 but may be better than this.  (See var.)  Best might be to start the ko immediately. (See var.)]
;W[ko];B[lp];W[im]C[This is bad news for B since the W stones escape.]

(;B[kn]C[This is not an effective move.  M6 or N6 look better.]
;W[jn];B[ln];W[lo];B[mo]
(;W[ml]C[I'm not sure of the purpose of this move.  Just cutting at N6 would seem more direct -- see var.]
;B[on]C[This seems off the mark since it doesn't actually defend the cut at N6.  (See var. on the next move.)]

(;W[pm]C[What about W L8 instead?

L8 would defend W's bottom center group, but I don't think that necessary yet.

What about the cut at N6?  I think it still works for W -- see vars.]
;B[kl]C[The cut at N6 is still undefended although perhaps not quite as effective for W now.]
;W[ll];B[km];W[hs];B[gq];W[gr];B[gp];W[is];B[el]C[Separating W's two groups and attacking the one on the left is a good idea, but B's group in the lower right is too weak for B to leave just yet.]
;W[kk];B[jk];W[jl];B[kj];W[lk];B[il];W[jm]C[What about W N6 instead?

Since this move makes N6 even more of a threat, I think this is fine for W.]
;B[mn];W[kr];B[hk]
(;W[hl]C[W could have played O3 first -- see var.];B[ik];W[io]
;B[nq];W[or]C[What about W N15 instead?

This move is sente for W so it seems reasonable to make forcing moves here since B only has one eye.

I'm not sure N15 is such a good move for W anyway.];B[oq];W[pr]
;B[qn]C[This seems like a chancy move for B since he still doesn't have two eyes.]

;B[re];W[me];B[qg];W[rf];B[ri]C[Here is where white gets into trouble i was really worried about W S12 being played. Are my fears justified?

Things get very complicated if W plays S12 (see var. on next move), but I'm not sure W comes out any better off.]

(;W[rg]C[luckily for me this happened];B[rh];W[pg];B[ph];W[rd]
TR[pn][pm][pl][pk][pj][qk][rk][qj][rj][ri][rh]C[B saves his marked stones, but W doesn't have to worry about the corner.  This could be a fair trade if W can save his marked stones.]
;B[qg]
(;W[qh]C[This is a wasted move.  Either W should capture at M14 or try to save his stones in the middle right side.  Is that possible?  Yes, I think so -- see vars.]
;B[sj]C[T10 looks like the killing move for black can white do anything about it at this point?

I think the move at S7 still saves W.]

Then W could end the ko by connecting at F6 (in which case B can still play S5 and capture those three stones) or W could save his three stones by playing S5 (in which case B can continue the ko).]

No.  I think that no matter what B does, W should be able to live or connect.  But nice try anyway.]
