C[Hello, I am kakiseirei on KGS, probably 2k in Real Life.



This game promoted me up to one dan, but I feel like I came from behind in this match and I don't know how.  In particual I felt I got lost in the early middle game, even though the skirmished seemed fairly balanced.



Thanks for any comments you have!];B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq]

(;B[hc]LB[qf:A]TR[dh]C[janr: White's move at A weakened the corner.  maybe reinforcing it is a good idea.

I didn't know how to attack the marked stone so I thought I should treat this more like a probe, perhaps F14 would have accomplished that better though

;B[kd]LB[hh:A][ii:B]C[janr: extending in the direction of A (or B) is urgent.  It's the border of two weak groups]

(;B[jg]C[perhaps cutting direct would be better];W[kh]LB[ic:B]
