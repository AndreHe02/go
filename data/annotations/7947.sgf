To the reviewer:

This is a game where I felt I didn't do well in the opening, but then I managed to make the game closer in the middlegame before making two big mistakes in the late endgame and ultimately losing.

I've put comments on some some moves of mine and my opponent's that I either felt could have been better, or felt was wrong but couldn't find anything better for. Thank you.

WOG General Comments:

There are three main themes where you can really improve I think.

1) Broaden your perspective
2) Count (we can all do that better)
3) Play moves with more than one meaning
4) Ask yourself if the opponent will respond to the move if I play there... what are the consequences if the opponent doesn't respond to my move

Broaden your perspective.  You tend to get myopic looking at the local situation ignoring the bigger board.  Why just focus on the narrow stuff at the fuseki stage?  Don't do that.  Focus on the entire board, everything that's potential and opportunity.  Your focus is so narrow, you miss what's going on elsewhere.  Remember the bumper sticker - Think Globally, Act Locally.   You're not even doing the opposite, you're Think Locally, Act Locally.  Go in the Fuseki stage is Global, not Local.  Options, not set local territory.  Don't force where your territory is going to be (save for whatever usual joseki patterns - that take in a GLOBAL perspective of how it should end up).

On counting, be sure that moves in the opening have more potential for a bigger score.  While in the midst of a joseki, this is not the case, for all other purposes, be sure you're getting the most from your plays - from the global perspective.

On playing moves with more than one meaning, you tend to play a lot of moves with just one meaning - local territory.  Obviously, all potential territory in the game needs to become local territory at some point, the state of things at the beginning of the game  - in the opening - is that you should try to maximize options.  You shouldn't know where your territory or the opponents will materialize.  Go is not that set in stone (short drum roll, cymbal hit).

One way you can really improve is by asking yourself - "If I play here, should my opponent respond?"  If the answer is no, then it better be pretty darn big.  If the answer is yes, then if the opponent doesn't play there, then you'll get a sizeable advantage]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr]
(;W[qn]C[WOG: I think from later moves that you prefer to not allow Black to make a moyo.  If that's the case, your style may be better off playing at r10]
;B[pj]
(;W[qq]C[WOG: You've decidedly put this stone out of reach of the stone at r6.  Absolutely fine.  However, your actions after this suggest that you like to see the two connected.  Strange, not absolutely fine.  If you're going to not keep the connection with the previous stone, why set it apart from the stone at r6?]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op]
(;W[nr]LB[rp:A]C[I didn't want to play the joseki at 'A' (s4) because I felt that it would have given Black too much, considering the stone at Q10. So I wanted to live in the corner without damaging R6, which I could plan on rescuing later.

WOG: This seems slow. The reason to play hane connect is that you gain sente in doing so.  This move doesn't hurt C more, but you're ignoring the rest of the board when playing here.  Sente means another move.  If you really wanted to help C then a better approach would be to play on the third line below the star point on the third line.  This way is inferior.  

Likewise, your comments suggest that the stone at r6 needs saving.  It doesn't.  It did its job already.  Trying to save it, protect it, is very very local thinking.  Don't think locally at the beginning.  Yes, there's some potential left in that stone... true.  However, there's a GIANT board out there where more potential exists than just thinking about that stone.]
(;B[mp]C[WOG: This is sort of slow.  Black's rewarded your slow play with Black's own slow play.]
;W[jd]LB[lq:A]C[
I wanted to limit Black's thickness on the right. 'A' (m3) was another move I was considering, but I felt that it would have given Black even more thickness.

WOG: I like this better than A.  Not because it's grossly better than A, but because it's a break in your LOCAL thinking :)]
;B[lq];W[rq]C[WOG: Again, slow.  Hane and connect is sente at least locally.  You're spending moves on a single purpose. Every move this early either needs to be joseki or multiple meanings.  This move gains you how many points?  Half of the connect to the r6 points and how many points in the corner?  

At least you were right at the outset of your own comments that you had mistakes in the beginning :)

Given the final score, 19 points to Black, assuming the middle game is even between you and Black, you can consider the loss from the fuseki.]
;B[fo]C[WOG: Nice.  Black never needs to extend, but ends up playing up.  Playing up is a nice consolation with good potential.]
(;W[ro]C[WOG: I hate to give advice I rarely follow, but.... Count!  How many points is this, big end game?  You've now spent six moves, three on the second line... slow! To change your thinking, think multiple meanings.  Does this move have more than one meaning (territory)?  No, it doesn't attack Black, doesn't build a moyo, doesn't attack something...]
;B[cl]C[WOG: Nice.  Black's stones are doing what your stones should be]
;W[em]TR[fo]C[
This was difficult for me - I wasn't sure where or even how to defend. Should I have not ignored the triangle move (f5) to begin with?

WOG: This move is the ideal spot for Black, so it's fine thinking to play the move Black should play, but what to do if Black cuts is the rest of the thinking you need to do.]
(;B[gm]C[WOG: Not sure about this move... The rule of four is: 

Where am I weak, Where is the opponent weak
Where am I strong, Where is the opponent strong

Optimally, play closer to weakness and farther from strength.  Here, the lone Black stone is the weak one.]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[ci]
(;W[fk]C[WOG: I know pushing and cutting in this shape is so... pedestrian, but seriously it's significantly superior to connecting four stones together (yeah, the other two in the corner are still left behind potentially due to cut aji) with 28.

This move at 28 leaves you with many stones slowly played];B[ch]
C[WOG: Ouch!  Now you can't even do the pedestrian move...]
(;W[hk]LB[nc:A]C[
Is this too slow? I thought Black getting this point would be too big since it expands his area of influence and also weakens the White group. Another move I was considering here was 'A' (p17).

WOG:  Yes, too slow.  You go out of your way to strengthen too much, then add another connected stone to the four.  It's a good point, but...  the problem isn't the move, per se.  It's your thinking above that's wrong.

You say, "...Black getting this point would be too big..."  Really?  What's the metric for "too big?"  Is it, you cannot catch up on points?  I think it goes back to your original issue - looking locally, not globally.  What would a Black stone there do?  It's great locally, but for the whole board, are there really no bigger points?  And, how many points does a Black stone here really add?

IMHO, I think a bigger move for White would be one that gains territory, semi-attacks Black, and has some bearing on helping this White group entering the middle... see variation.]
(;B[mc]C[WOG: This is OK... but...]
(;W[re]C[WOG: I get a general sense that you don't like the opponent to take territory :)  You always break your opponent's attempts to take territory.  That's a fine attitude in general, but if you always follow your opponent around the board, you're a move behind and a dollar short]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[rb];B[qc];W[qh]

C[WOG: Much too comfortable for White IMHO];B[rk]C[WOG: Mudai?  I think this is a bit too aggressive.]

C[WOG: Doh!]
(;W[qf]C[WOG: You let Black off the hook!];B[om]C[WOG: A sort of quasi-fix...]
(;W[il]C[WOG: Again with the breaking Black... and playing too close to your own stones]
(;B[in]C[WOG: You infected Black with your local thinking :)  That's an accomplishment at least :)   What is Black getting from this ... how many points?]
(;W[sc]C[WOG: This is aji keshi... Do you already know that you don't want to pressure Black from the other side?  Was Black about to play here?  These are the things to consider before choosing this side vs. the other side.]
(;B[qb];W[of]C[WOG: What are you hoping to accomplish with this move?  Black sliding down to k18?  If so, isn't that bad?  

Is White's life threatened here?  No.

This move is almost dame.]
(;B[hc]C[WOG: Black's a little too aggressive here... especially given your almost superfluous move at p14... becoming less and less superfluous as Black makes more groups.]
;W[kc]C[WOG:  Good!];B[he]
(;W[le]C[WOG:  Is this the best move?  Doesn't quite conect to the White on the side... Doesn't get a jump ahead in the middle against the Black group on the side... Seems kind of nurui... lukewarm]
;B[sb];W[nd]C[WOG: Nice fix to the lukewarm move, as far as a LOCAL only perspective goes :)]
;B[dd]C[WOG: More overplay from Black?  The corner is safe now?]

(;W[cq]C[WOG: This is big and IMHO correct, but I cannot help but think you're not thinking about the whole board here.  The question you have to ask yourself is... is this enough?  Should my opponent respond?  Of course, the answer is no, the opponent doesn't have to respond.   Yes, it's a base for your stones and territory in the corner... all good.
