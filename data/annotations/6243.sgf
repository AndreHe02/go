C[Pauloq [12k\]: salut
olddog [10k?\]: Hi
Matil [12k\]: hi, good game

Thanks in advance for doing this review.

Throughout the whole game I had the feeling the game
wasn't really going right. I think I made many mistakes
throughout the game, but I did still manage to win due
to a mistake of the other player. Why I'm asking for a
review of this game is because I can't quite grasp how
the mistakes I made affected the overall game. In other
words I don't really understand how my mistakes (and
my "good" moves) affected the flow of the game.

***Hi, I will be reviewing your game for you. Because I'm only a 6k now, there might be some inaccuracies in my comments. Feel free to disagree with them. Hope the comments can help you in your future games.

***Next time when you ask for a review, please state what color you played so we know who are we reviewing for. And also remove the extra variations unless you wanted us to comment on them. If you wanted us to comment on them, leave a comment at the end of the variation so we will know. Too many uncommented variations will make the move list too cluttered and make reviewing tough. Thanks.]

***This is not recommended. This is because when black goes R3, he's going to have a better shape than white.

*** White can play Q6, P5, P6 or even tenuki.];B[qq]TR[qp]SQ[pn]

***Now black have a better shape than white. White cannot cut black at R4 because black can just join at S4. And white have a cutting point at Q6 and needed one more move to secure the cut. From this, we can say that in most cases(must depend on whole board situation), white should not play Q4 as black will have a better shape than white.]

***With this move, you are not protecting your corner but building framework to match with the stone at D4. Of course this can be played if your style is more of building moyo and some fighting. But keep in mind, the UL corner is not secure yet and black can take the corner and live inside. the area around C14 can also be a possibe invasion point for black.

***There are always pros and cons for different style and there is not really any right or wrong. Just make sure be consistent in your plan.]

white also made many mistakes.

***Yes, both side made mistakes but I believe both will learn from them and get stronger. Both side have chances to win but it is you who is able to capitalise on opponent's mistakes, therefore you win the game. I mostly commented at the opennings and some important places in the game. The lack of comments in the middlegame dosen't mean its not important. I feel you will gain more if you just focus more on a few things at one time. So I just pick out what i feel is more important to you at this moment.There are some points you need to look  out;

#1 - Know where are the big points. Big points are places where it may develop into a big moyo. Both you and your opponent will like to get there first.

#2 - Be always aware of your weak groups. They are urgent. Do not play elsewhere until you settled them. And also don't attack other weak groups with yours unless you can settled your group while attacking.

#3 - Do more life and death questions(Tsumego problems). They will help you in your reading when you are wondering if some groups are alive. And also how to live or kill groups. 

***#2 is the most important for i had observed in this game that you have ignore your weak groups several times and played elsewhere or you played some moves that further weaken your weak groups. So always remember, be aware of your weak groups and avoid creating them.

***Thats all for the comments. Thanks for the game you have provided. I'm sure both of us had learned something from this review. If you have any more problem about this game, feel free to email me or better still, look for me in KGS for i'm on it most of the time. Currently i'm playing under the nick lucas001 so leave a msg if i'm not around. Hope to see you soon in KGS.]
