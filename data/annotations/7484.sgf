C[Hi Dawid,

I've responded to most of your comments throughout, and made a few about other things.  There are also a few variations showing some diffeent directions you could have tried, some without comment if I thought I'd covered the discussion previously.  Hopefully it all makes sense.

Andrew


dawid963 [6k\]: hi gg
grelon [6k\]: bonne partie

Hi i am dawid. i play white
I feel all the time that black was ahead in fuseki and beginning of chuban.
I had moyo(or potential) in center and i had problems to handle with this moyo

TR[ch][di][cj]C[I consider also to invade at A. Would it be right idea?

I think one of the triangle moves is good.  C 10 & 12 because they each press on a weakness of black's: the c6 stone or the lone c14 stone.  D11 has more options to run out from what is black's area of influence.]
;W[fc];B[ff];W[dh];B[dg];W[dl];B[ck]
(;W[dm]C[I feel this is too heavy, ie too many stones invested without much potential for growth.  You really need only reduce black over here.  

See the variation for a possible way to avoid this.];B[bn];W[dk]
;B[cj];W[dj];B[ch];W[hk]C[Having to play this move is painful.  And you have to play it because you recognize that that is a lot of stones to lose.  Playing lightly helps save you from losing sente this way.]
;B[qe]TR[pb][mc][nc][bd][be][iq][or][pr]C[This is odd for black.  Q18 seems like a possible move here, though it is usually played after black r14.  

Q2 and B16 are both cash moves, ie generating a fair number of points while putting a litte bit of pressure on the nearby black stones.  

P2 and B15 are similar but put more pressure on black.  Black will usually respond as in the variation, and white can decide to respond immediately or play elsewhere and still get a reasonable result.

These four look kinda small at first glance, but they are all very playable here.  See second variation.

O17 abd N17 are also both good.  O17 might be more advisable with how strong black's corner is.  

J3 is also big as you would both like to play there.  Black has the e2 follow up to H3, and black l3 is kinda cramped if you get J3.  P2 J3 might be a great combo.]

(;W[qj]C[What i can play instead r10?];B[qh];W[oj];B[ql]
(;W[pm]C[Q7 was rather bad move

This move is a somewhat normal one except for r12's proximity.  R8 turns out to be a strong stone due to that proximity.  Killing it might not be a reasonable thing, so you might just look for way to make it a weak heavy group.]

F17 and d16 are kinda pissed here :) but this is just one way to make some light shape here.  The key is sprinkling stones around in black's influence with good relations to each other.]
