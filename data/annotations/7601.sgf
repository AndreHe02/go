C[I just started go one month ago. I am black. I lost two consecutive games against this opponent. I think this reflects my weakness in  local fights. I would like to know more. I mentioned in the notes some obvious blunders I have made and noted.

CJT - My review comments marked CJT

Overall there are no glaring mistakes that lost you this game.  You were too low in the opening, giving white huge central influence in return for a little territory, and then you were unable to overcome that influence.

Looking through the game, I noticed that by move 34 I felt W had an advantage.  This is mainly because of the way you handled the invasion of move 24 - so if there's one specific place I think you can improve - it is to study how to handle invasions in the opening.  Also don't play opening moves on the second line!

I hope you find this review helpful.];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp]
;B[qj]LB[ec:a][dj:b]C[CJT - More usual after a 4-3 opening move is tomake a corner enclosure at A - although this does make somewhere around B a good move for W next...]
;W[jp];B[bj]C[CJT - Too low - you should avoid playing on the second line in the opening as a rule.]
;W[ic]
(;B[qo]LB[pn:a]C[CJT - Here you might try to put some pressure on W8 - see variation.

If playing in this corner, A is generally better since it doen't let W expand the lower side so much.]
;W[qp];B[ro];W[rp]LB[po:a]C[CJT - This is wrong from W, A is far superior -aiming for a large lower side while keeping your right side small.]
;B[cn]C[CJT - Now I hope you can see that the stone at B10 would be much more complementary at C10 or D10.]
;W[dn]LB[dm:a]C[CJT - You can play hane here at A. (Though again the hane is stronger if B10 was not so low.)]
;B[cm];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[bn]MA[bp][co][dn][dp][jp]CR[bo][cn]
[cm][bj]C[CJT - Can you see the difference between the amount of power the 5 W stones marked x have compared to the 5 B stones marked O?  The B shape would be called low and overconcentrated - especially if W plays D7 or E8 later...]
;W[ec];B[dc]LB[de:a]C[CJT - This move invites W to press down on your left side (just like he did below) - better is to keep the left side open (at the cost of the corner) with A in my opinion.]
;W[ed];B[de];W[cg];B[cf]LB[ee:a][di:b]C[CJT - I would be tempted here to try and isolate the invading W stone with A - then looking to play around B to chase it out to the middle.  Chasing a weak W group is a good way to build influence and territory (andsince you don't have any really weak groups, you should be looking to do this to regain some initiative).]
;W[dg]C[CJT - See how B25 just invited W to make the stone stronger?]
;B[df]LB[ee:a][dj:b]C[CJT - An empty triangle - I still prefer A aiming at B.]
;W[dj]C[CJT - Now W gets to play here, which is not good - it looks like your lower left and top left corner groups are being shut in.]
;B[cj];W[bg];B[bf];W[ci];B[ck]LB[dk:a][on:b]C[CJT - You needn't respond immediately - A looks better though - but I prefer B overall.]
;W[pn]MA[dn][dp][jp][pp]C[CJT - Now look at the strength of W's moyo.]
;B[po];W[oo]
(;B[qq]LB[on:a]C[Probably a very bad move. Just trying...

CJT - Yes this looks like a waste. Pushing through with your previous move is usually only worth it if there is an interesting cut to follow up with - in this case the only interesting option is B.  See variation for what that might look like.]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[qn];W[pm]
(;B[qm];W[pl];B[ql];W[pj]C[CJT - Again look how W has closed you in - 'crawling' along the 3rd line like this usually gives the advantage to the other player.]
;B[pi]C[CJT - Here you are right to];W[qk];B[rk];W[pk];B[qi]
;W[so];B[sn];W[sp];B[qf]LB[lc:a]C[CJT - This is very slow. You need to make this corner as big as possible with a move like A.]
;W[sm];B[rn]LB[rl:a]C[CJT - Ok I didn't spot this either - but I'm sure you realised that the better move is A.]
;W[rl];B[rj];W[md];B[nc]C[CJT - I like this move.  However looking at your position is not so good - W has got hardly any territory, but has almost completely surrounded the center f the board (and should get quite a lot of territory on the lower side).]
;W[mc];B[nd];W[of];B[ke]MA[cm][ck][pi][df][de]LB[fl:a][nh:b]
[ee:c]C[CJT - I agree that you need to make inroads into W's center, but you still have three bases to use - I've marked them X.

Rather than throwing an isolated stone into the center where it will be strongly attacked, use one of these bases - e.g. moves like A, B or C.]

;W[ie];B[jf];W[id];B[ge];W[gd];B[fd];W[fc];B[fe]C[CJT - Here you were lucky to connect this group to a safe base - so you did make some positive inroads that W should not have allowed.]
