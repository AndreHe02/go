C[Hi reviewer!
i played white in this game, my opponent resigned but i only really won because of the komi.
I'd be happy to hear any comments you have, especially on the opening because black played a very non standard opening and i was not sure how to respond to this.
Thanks

hello <jasper2>. I was pleased revieweing this game, my comments are followed by (LL).
you played well in this game, except a few mistakes on directions.
although, you had a chance wining the game at move 60, but you failed doing it.
at the end, you did well when seeing the killing tesuji in the north-east corner...
... and, when demonstrating how to win with the bent four in the corner.
Laurent (1k on KGS)];B[pf]C[atos [6k\]: en garde !
jasper2 [6k\]: enjoy!
jasper2 [6k\]: bonjour :)

a strange opening, but why not ?...
