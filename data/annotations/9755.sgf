C[M: I added a summary at the end.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd]
;B[fc];W[hc]TR[pd]LB[cf:A][df:B][kc:C]C[M: I personally would definitely prefer to answer (at A or maybe B) instead of this pincer in this position (though it is certainly possible).  The marked black stone on the upper right plus the nature of this diagonal fuseki on the whole board makes me feel just comefortable answering as White.

In contrast to a parallel fuseki it's much harder/ less likely to build a a framework (moyo) of some sort.  That means by just taking territory White's komi is worth even more (at least this is how it is considered nowadays as I understand it and might be the reason it is much less popular for Black to play this way).

Of course this pincer offers Black the choice to start some early sort of complication/ fight, so if that's what you prefer, you might as well play this way.  White A on the other hand keeps it simple for White, which is as I said just fine here.  Also if Black answers to White A with a play on the top as well, White has sente to play first elsewhere.

This is probably already way too much text for this early position, but I hope it get's you some useful ideas.  :)

One last thing: If you really want to play on the top there are also some lighter choices like C, which was the popular choice when this diagonal fuseki was standard in ancient China ... but let's go on for now.  :)]
;B[cf]
(;W[df]LB[fd:A]C[M: Again I would prefer the simpler alternative of A for White here (despite the proverb of "attaching to the stronger stone").  See variation.]
;B[dg];W[ef]TR[fc]LB[fd:A]C[I dont know of any joseki for this situation, I was just playing what I though to be reasonble moves, I was hoping to get out into the centre while pressuring f 17.

M: I tried to answer this by showing the alternative of directly attaching to the marked black stone at A instead of this kind of leaning attack.  The main problem with this attachment in the game might be that after it the marked black stone still has aji so White might still have to add another move to capture it which might turn out to be overconcetrated and (maybe more important) gote.]

(;B[cd]
(;W[dc]TR[fc]LB[cc:A][ce:B]C[M: White should either hane at A (see variation) or maybe even wedge at B instead of this timid extension.  You probably were afraid of the aji of the marked Black stone on the top, but White is strong enough to play the normal shape point - answer to attachment with hane.  This game move is a bit too submissive and lets Black make even more territory too easily.

To look at it another way, had Black jumped into the corner at A directly whith his previous move, you probably would have blocked the left side with the wedge at B, instead of this side (see variation starting with Black at A), but that would be the same result as in the game.

(Btw. if you haven't seen this before: This method of changing the order of moves to look at a position and the moves that lead to it is called tewari and can be very useful).]
;B[cc];W[ge]LB[gd:A]C[M: The diagonal at A seems to be more solid than this knight's move, which leaves more aji.]
;B[cj]LB[cg:A][ch:B][dh:C]C[M: This also might be a just a bit overextended as there is still aji with the cut at A.  Maybe just the tiger mouth connection at B or solid extension at C is safer here, too.]
;W[nc];B[qf]C[In hindsight I wonder if my next move was inappropriate]

(;W[nq]LB[ne:A][fq:B]C[M: Indeed I'm not sure about this move.  I would definitely prefer your own suggestion at A (very big) and on the lower half of the board I would consider approaching again at B to be more effective than making an enclosure as the former is concerned with both sides (while the enclosure in the game is merely effecting ones own side).]
;B[pj]LB[qk:A][ne:B][qn:C][ql:D][fq:E]C[M: I see that Black wants to get the extension from both corner enclosures, but I still doubt this move.  If an extension on the right, I would at least go to A, but it would still result in a generally flat position for Black.

B is still more urgent for both sides.  It's also kind of sente for Black while the game move still needs another move to complete a formation at the right (Black wants to play at C next, otherwise White might approach Black's fourth line move on the third line at D).

Again, if White just plays B now, White builds on a much bigger scale while keeping Black low (e.g. White B, Black C, White E).]

(;W[cn]LB[fq:A][ne:B]C[This seemed liked a must do move

M: I would actually still prefer approaching at A.  For one it is on the wider (more open) side.  Invading here makes a perfect target to attack for Black, which is not what White wants.

I have put some continuations, I could imagine, in the variation to the current move for White at A.  The main idea is, that there are still so many big points to play for both sides, B maybe still the most urgent one.

And I don't think the left side (or an invasion there) is the most urgent part now as other parts of the board are still much more open/ wider.]

(;B[fq]LB[co:A]C[M: It's normal and good for Black to exchange A first to make White heavier and profit by attacking.  This is making White settle too easily.

(see Variation)]
(;W[bp]C[I felt I had to come in here sonce I was not making much in the way of points

M: Getting a base like this can't be wrong, although the 3-3 invasion (see variation) might still be considered as an option, but makes Black too solid on the left side.]
;B[cq]
(;W[bq]
(;B[qn]
(;W[pl]LB[ql:A][pk:B][rp:C][on:D][ne:E][cl:F][hq:G]C[All I knew is I cant let black have it all, and this was pretty much lets see what happens kind of move.

M: I see, so learning by doing.  Hopefully I can contribute to that.  :)

Actually this move happened to be exactly of the kind that mainly helps your opponent while not getting near enough in exchange.  ;)

You probably didn't want to play a real invasion on the thrid line (A), cause you felt it to be too deep, so this seems like a safe compromise, but as I said, it is a bit wishy-washy and actually helps Black.

A is the normal invasion point and White might expect to actually live with that invasion though strengthening Black considerably on the outside while doing so (see variations).

So the real question is if any kind of invasion is really the right idea.  I want to emphasize this as you expressed your concern about Black getting too much.  This is of course the wrong fixed idea.  Let me explain this by another suggestion for White's current move.  What about just quietly taking the corner (which is big) with C.  Black might answer at D, or may not.  If he does it's just a fair exchange of points (and if White keeps sente to play the next big points, wich is still very important in this whole board position).  White get's something here Black there.  So there's a balance.  And balance is the key word here, go is all about balance.  So don't worry about your opponent getting too much.  Just take something for yourself and give something to your opponent in exchange.  Also consider that Black already has played four stones on the right side, so naturally is very strong and is expected to get a fair amount of points.

As I said, more important is the whole board view.  E is still the biggest point and also more urgent than the lower right.  But F is even more urgent now, as it effects White's base, which is always the most urgent point, so I would not hesitate to play it right away.  Then you can also think about something like G, which can look for attacking the lower left Black group while extending on the bottom, which ist still open.  But beware that attacking only works, if you are strong yourself so first strengthening your own group with F is a necessary preperation.]
;B[ql];W[qk]
(;B[qj]C[M: Black is strong, so holding back like this is too slack.  See variations.]
;W[qm];B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[or];W[nr];B[oq]
;W[op];B[pq];W[mo];B[pk]LB[rl:A]C[M: This move is not necessary at all and isn't big enough at this stage of the game.

Let's assume White just submissively answers at A, then Black has gained nothing and has only strengthened White (by forcing her to capture).  So it may be considered aji-keshi (see Sensei's Library :) ).

But worse than that, White doesn't even have to answer and still play one big point/ urgent point as already mentioned, so Black loses the precious sente.]
;W[ol]C[I figured coming out was bigger than saving some stones

M: See my judgement just before.  :)  You miss your chance to take sente yourself and punish Black's slack move.  Besides in terms of endgame points just capturing might be bigger, but forget that here as both misses the point here, mainly to just ignore Black's slack move by taking sente!  :)]
;B[rk]C[M: See before.];W[jq]C[M: As I suggested before and now that White has build up considerable strength even more, this extension should be wider.  Now it's much too near to your own strength and too far from Black's group to really effect it.  But as I said more urgent points elsewhere.]
;B[hq]LB[cl:A][hq:B]C[M: I think Black should first take the chance to play at A finally.  After all keeping neighboring enemy groups weak indirectly strengthens your own group.

White would have to answer somehow (probably by jumbing out), so Black can still secure a base with e.g. B, if necessary and has the chance to attack the White group, which is still quite weak.]
;W[ip]LB[cl:A][ne:B]C[M: After Black is already that strong, this move seems out of topic.  Still A or maybe B.]
;B[hp]C[M: Black was already strong and is getting quite overconcentrated here.  The eyes should still be on the lower left White group.]
;W[io];B[ho];W[in];B[hn]C[M: Pushing from behind like this is not great style.  Although Black wants to get more strength for an attack against the lower left group, which is a good idea, letting White develop like this in the center might still be questionable.]

;B[dm];W[ne]C[M: Finally!  :)];B[md]C[M: This might be okay as kikashi (a forcing move, White has to answer, like a peep here, which is then considered lightly and serving some useful purpose like helping an invasion/ weak group to settle).]

(;B[mf]C[M: This reduction is too slack, letting White make solid territory on the fifth line!]

;B[ei]
(;W[fi]C[M: Blocking the (small) center isn't really big here.  There are many big endgame points on the second line left.  You should always look for the big endgame points on the second line (or sometimes even third), which certainly means near the edge not in the center.  These points also are mostly worth twice as much as it may seem, so to speak, because they effect both sides territory (not only yours).]

The thing is, that just securing your lead is totally enough for White, so anything fancy would be plain wrong.]
;W[rm]LB[cr:A][ir:B][bl:C]C[M: This is too small still, though. There are still A and B, which are both much bigger.

Would it have been possible for me to do anything in the lower right?

M: Yes, Black should answer, otherwise it is ko for life.

Summary:

Black got a good result after some wrong direction plays of White in the lower half of the board, but White could take the lead next after turning a big moyo at the top into territory (with help by Black).  After some quite disastrous reading mistakes by Black on the upper left, which led to White taking the whole corner, the game seemed to be over, but Black put up a good fight inside White's moyo at the top, which White managed sovereign, securing the lead and winning the game.

Over all one can say that White had good intuition in the important late middle game fighting, which secured the win.  Black on the other hand was prone to some overplays, which cost him the good starting position.  The main part to study should be direction of play, opening principles like big and urgent points.]

If a reduction is enough then Black should just reduce with something like A or B.  Note how the aji of the marked stone helps considerably with all of these.

Please take all these variations to this position with a good grain of salt as they are not at all solid science and are only ment to give some rough ideas of what type of things might happen, which might hopefully already be more useful for you than too many details anyway.

(;W[ne]C[Perhaps here was better?

M: Yes, I actually would have expected something like this for White to develop at the top.  This jump is very nice for White, of course, building quite the moyo at the top.

Of course Black on the other hand has the left side, and the option to develop at the bottom, maybe get some wing formation there for himself, so Black is still good, too.]

(;W[cc];B[ce];W[dc]LB[de:A][cg:B]C[M: This is the normal result.  The cut at A is safe for now as Black also has the cut at B to worry about.]

(;B[cc]C[M: Jumping into the corner probably doesn't lead to a satisfying result for Black here.]

;W[cg]TR[hc]C[M: The marked stone turns out to be placed at the perfect spot to attack the black group, so Black has still to defend, while White has a very thick position.  This might not be satisfying for Black.]

(;W[fd]LB[cc:A]C[M: The normal idea for Black now is to jump into the corner at the 3-3 point (A).]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de]LB[ce:A][cb:B]C[M: This is one possible continuation.  Black next connects solidly at A or descends at B.  In any case this seems quite good for Black in terms of territory.  On the other hand I think it's an okay position for White too as White's group is quite stable and the upper right is hard to develop for Black now.  Also the left side being one direction of development for Black is still quite open.]
