Hi,

 My name is Sarun Lorteerapong. I played Black in this game. There were many mistakes made by both of us. Please help me get stronger! Thank you very much!

*********************
Hi Sarun,

I will do my best to help.

[qo]C[Should i have continued to walk at  the triangle space? I felt that my two square stones were weak and in danger of being seperated from the rest of the group. I didn't want white to develop the bottom while chasing me.

**************
I think Black's move here is correct. It punishes white for not pushing and strengthens the black group. White's upward push is not  worth too much because of the black stone at Q17.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[pi];B[nj];W[ce]LB[qe:A][qf:B]C[Maybe instead of C15, white should have extended to A or B? What do you think?

I would agree. An extension here by black is severe. Urgent before big.]

I don't believe the cut works. See variation.]
(;B[qb];W[rf];B[qg];W[rg];B[qh];W[rh];B[nf];W[og]C[********
The three black stones here are unimportant. Black should sacrifice them for a solid outside wall. See variation]

(;B[of];W[mh];B[eq]C[************
This is big, but the top area is too open for black. One move there will solidify things for him. A play around J16 would be good. There is still time after white plays to play a move like E3 (which is oddly placed anyway - white has more potential on the left side.)]
;W[dp];B[ep];W[jd];B[hc];W[mc]C[W playing too close to black's influence?

*******
No this is a proper invasion. However, white should run to the center not N17. The H17 undercuts white's position.]
;B[jb]TR[he][ef][kf]C[I played this to take away white's base as well as secure some points. Should i have played one of the triangle points instead?

*******
I think you have to make him run as you did to gain benefit. If white lived locally, the resulting outside wall would not be worth much due to the N12 C15 and D13 stones.]

No, White cannot afford to let black get the pon-nuki.

This is poor timing. Black needs to keep the center white stones cut off. The cut at L10 is too big.]

A mistake. White must run.];B[ej];W[ck]TR[cj]SQ[kc][mc][jd]
[je][jf][hg][jg][gh]C[Triangle better than C9 for white? also, it seems like he is making it harder and harder for his square group to escape. But he is making good profit on the side

**************
The gamble is big.  Black should be able to reduce left side and seal in the box group.]
;B[fi];W[gp]TR[jq]C[was the triangle stone and overplay?

******

No. The two stone black group can run up, threatening the left side. Then the triangle gets put into motion 

Alternatively. The two black stones are sacrificed to destroy the left. Probably a better option. In this case, the triangle easily escapes to the thickness of the Q7 group.]
;B[en];W[gn]TR[cn]C[White triangle better?

Most definitely. Black will devastate the left.];B[fo];W[hq]

White might be able to exploit the weakness of the black group above, but he can probably make another eye instead of connecting. For example, White F3, F2,F4,E5,G2]

Like i said before, We both made so many mistakes. Please help me correct them and become a stronger player. Thank you very much for your service!

Also, any recommendation on study material, books, etc. are very welcomed!

******************

A very exciting and interesting game. White's style here was to overplay and hope that Black would not be able to punish. This is a common tactic, especially at around this level of play, though I confess that I sometimes do it :). 

I believe strongly that reading and tesuji are what make a strong player. So I believe that to study its good to do many problems like this. James Davies Tesuji and "Get strong at Tesuji" are both full of good exercises. Life and Death is almost as important. 

Basically higher level strategy can only work if you have the strength in place to read out sequences. For example, you might understand that if someone invades your moyo, you should be able to gain advantage, but unless you have good reading, you won't be able to get that advantage.

Good luck with your play!
