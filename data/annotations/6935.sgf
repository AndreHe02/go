;W[nq];B[oq];W[np]C[You focus allot on the corner here while there are more improtant things to attend. However, so does you opponent so not much harm is done. A move on the left side is bigger then fighting this corner right now.]

;B[kb];W[jc]C[To far. Black splits and then what? Maybe H17 is a better choise then M17. However the left side is still bigger.]
;B[kc];W[kd];B[ic];W[dj]C[Good but a bit late. Had black placed here before you you would be in much trouble.]

;B[bc];W[cb];B[db];W[bb];B[ab];W[ad];B[ca];W[ac];B[ep]C[Ok black invades... what to do what to do. You sholde use this situation to strenghten you possition. Let black have a smal area while you build a fortres.]
;W[eo]C[This is a bit to offensive. You should play more defensive and strenghten you left side here.]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[er];W[gp];B[dr];W[cr];B[fo];W[fp]C[You cut here in an attempt to kill blacks group? This is good if you succeed but if you fail it's horrible since it will leave black strong and with allot of potential since you cutting him meens that your groups are split apart. Again you shuld play defensive and build terretory up against your wall to the right.

A move like G2 is better. That in combination with your E5 move at D5 instead looks nice right?]
;B[do];W[en];B[cq];W[cp];B[bq];W[co];B[gr];W[gn];B[lj]C[now you where forced to make terretory facing the middle instead of the edge. Such terrotory is much harder to protect.

ok, black attacks. Look at your options. You can secure terretory or try to kill black. Killing black here is allmost impossible but that is what you'r trying to do by cutting him. A move like G10 or maybe even H10 would give you much terretory here. Let black poke a hole in your thought out terretory and defend the rest instead.]
;W[nj];B[mi];W[ni];B[nh];W[mj];B[lh]C[ok. now it's obvious that black will not die. So you schould play away form him and make you terretory insted of poking him.]
;W[jh];B[jj]C[black is extending further and further into your doman to stop him you cant play so close. He will only cut you over and over again.]

;B[km];W[ej];B[fi];W[fh]C[Again, play AWAY not so close. Black will only cut you up.]
