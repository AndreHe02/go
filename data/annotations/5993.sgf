(;B[jd]LB[co:a][op:b]C[JC>  How do we know what is the biggest point to play in the opening?
Step 1) take a corner
Step 2) Enclose a corner or approach a corner
Step 3) Extend along a side

The black move skipped Steps 1 and 2 so it should be a special strategy.

If it's not then then the proper move should be step 2) enclose a corner or approach.

So we want to work into Step 2 and choose the biggest part of the board to do so.
So what is the biggest?

4 sides to analyize
A) Top - D16 is on 4-4 point and freindly Q16 is on a 4-4 point giving a 11 space gap 4 stones high
B) Left - D3 is on the 4-3 point and D16 is an enemy stone giving 12 space gap 4 stones high
C) Bottom - D3 on 3-4 point and friendly R4 is on 4-3 point giving 12 space gap and 3.5 stones high
D) Left - R4 is on 3-4 point and enemy Q16 is on 4-4 point giving 11 space gap and 3.5 stones high

gap length is bigger than height. So in order of priority, the Left is the most important, then Bottom, then Top then lastly Right side.]
;W[oq]C[JC> White missed the big left side as well.];B[pn]
(;W[lq]
(;B[pk];W[co]C[JC> White got the biggest point first instead.]
;B[fp]C[JC> M3 is low, F4 should be low as well.];W[cl]C[JC> Too close, Black can make white heavy and get the corner again]

(;B[iq]C[JC> This is the wrong approach. 5 space game 3.5 high, and allows white to jump into the corner properly settling his stones with good shape]

(;W[nc]C[JC> Since the bottom right for white is not settled, this is probably the right direction.  You don't want to strengthen the black stones at the bottom right causing trouble for his unsettled stone on the bottom.]

(;B[gc]C[JC> not really a corner approach, if Black jumped all the way to F17 then K16 is the correct distance from it but it's too high because O18 is low.]

(;W[cf];B[lc];W[qf]LB[qe:a]C[JC the corner is not well protected this way. "a" is better.]
;B[qh];W[qr];B[rr]
(;W[rq]C[JC> mistake by white];B[qq];W[pr];B[rp];W[bq];B[br]

(;W[en]C[JC> Mistake by white, The enlargment is not very big.  Top left is bigger by a large margin]

(;B[cq]C[JC> Black can do better];W[bp];B[di]LB[eb:a][qc:b]
C[JC> this area will never get very big.  The top left and right are not completed yet. Anything around "a" would hurt white, and "b" is a good invation point now that black is strong on both sides.]
;W[ci];B[cj];W[ch];B[dj];W[ef]LB[ec:a]C[JC> White encloses 2 more points? "a" is huge]
;B[gj]TR[cj][dj][di]LB[eb:a]C[JC>The area around "a" is still the biggest point on the board.  The marked stones are not weak and are not in trouble]

(;B[ol]TR[si][ri][qh][rg]C[JC> This is wrong, the weakness here is that white threatens to disconnect the marked stones from the others.  So just stop that by standing up (See previous variation)]
