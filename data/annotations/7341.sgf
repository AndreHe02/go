C[Paul: You asked mainly about fighting and middle game stuff, so I mainly stuck to that.  The main thing to watch for is attack and defense.  In the middle game you should contest the borders your opponent thinks they have made.  Attack their weaknesses.  You have to really look for them.  It's tricky stuff.  Places you can cut, places they over played, places you can get in and run back to your thickness... it's an art.  Fortunately, there's whole books on the subject.

;W[rk];B[rl];W[sl]C[Q: tenuki here was a misplay, right?  Or did I botch the defense?

Paul: No, things got crazy on you.  Clearly white saw the snapback before-hand.  You have to be really careful anywhere you have bad shapes (back on b43, you made the empty triangle, and it's not connected to the rest of your stones... danger, danger).

It's that cutting point that causes the real trouble, as you can see.  I don't really see any way out of it besides playing one of the variations now.  Even if there were a really good way to memorize this exact position, the best strategy is probably to simply read this stuff out.

Normally, I'd say this is end game play and to just ignore it, but it does seem to be worth like 20 or 25 points.  In the middle game it's hard to find a move worth that much. 

D14 maybe?  E4?  It's hard to say.]

(;W[hp]C[airfrog: I don't know why he played out the ladder here, but it gave me a big advantage.  I was looking to surround this corner anyway, though, what would have been a good way to accomplish this if White hadn't played out the ladder?

Paul: haha, ladder. I'm not sure you can really surround that lower left.  He's got too many stones in there.  Generally, it's pretty hard to kill someone.  Generally, they can make life (even if small) by sacrificing the right things.  (generally) 

Those stones he doesn't need, that he just uses for escape... we call that Aji.  Because of all your cutting points and things, he's got an awful lot of Aji to use down there.]

;B[fl];W[gq];B[em]C[Q: Could I have won the corner here or was I overplaying?

Paul: once someone plays out of the ladder, capture it.  It's a proverb.  I don't recall the exact expression, but basically, just capture it.  For every move they made in the ladder, you gained 7pts (also a proverb).  It's not worth getting into their little fight over.]

Paul: I don't think he should have lived in here.  Certainly, your strategy is a whole board one, and that's good, but I don't think white should have lived in here.  Once he's completely surrounded by black stones, there isn't a lot of Aji left to exploit.  I bet if you play with this corner, you can find a way to keep him from living in almost every way he tries.

I also think 129 should have tried to split C13 from E16.  Neither of those groups are particularly strong.  If they live, they should get very few points for white.]

Paul: Never try to make territory from thickness.  Use thickness to attack.  Drive your opponent into it.  You make moyo's from lose stones, not from walls.  Of course, this is a game of balance, so this late in the middle game, you do what you have to do.  But generally speaking, don't make territory from thickness.  That entirely misses the point of the thickness!!]

I know with R15 at R14, it's a special shape called Kannonbikari and white can always live.  I think this one is safer and white can get a Ko, but if you really wanted to protect that corner, I would have gone for either R17 or R16.  I don't think R15 quite does it.  In any case, what actually happened didn't seem reasonable either.

(;B[ok];W[oj];B[nk]C[Paul: Splitting attacks are usually pretty effective.  The idea is to search for your opponent's weak points and cut them.  Then instead of having a bunch of useful thickness to use, they suddenly have a bunch of weak groups they have to deal with.  Now I'm not saying white is weak yet here, but you can see that he's divided.  And it's certainly a lot different than the alternative...

Compare this setup with the move at the actual 42.])
(;B[ep]C[Paul: Another splitting attack.  The idea is to make either f3 or d4 totally useless.  You have the thickness at K3 and K4... if  you can drive him up against it, it could help.

It's hard to realize at your level, or my level, or even at the level of the people that give me 9 handicap stones, but the thickness white has is actually worth quite a lot more than the territory you have.  The strategy (I think) is to get in the way of the thickness.  If you can nutralize it all, he can't use it against you.  So provoking fights that you can live through, right in front of his thickness, might just help.

On the other hand, that thickness is probably useful in that fight and you could just as well lose.

Anyway, at this point in the game you should be trying to find things you can attack.  Don't make attacks that don't work, but don't make weak expansions into the middle ... carve your way in and the place to look is where white is weak -- particularly where white is weak but thinks he was strong, which is why I like the move at P9.  Then his thickness becomes his problem instead of yours.

E4 seems ok too though.]))
