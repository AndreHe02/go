C[Seishinsan: hi have fun

Radu: I will try to develop various alternatives to play. My comments will be prefixed with R. I hope you will enjoy.








hey :D i would like you too help/review especially the beginnin/opening and my reaction to the invasion at turn 38.
i hope you can give me some tips and help me to improve ^-^]
;B[dd];W[jd]C[krzee: you as well];B[dj];W[jk]C[R: White played lower. Bottom side becomes White main target. I would either do an exchange for upper side or jump in and take bottom side first.]
;B[fi]C[R: not an usual joseki. Esp W being lower in right bottom corner, an invasion is easy]

(;W[fc];B[dc]TR[ec][fe][dg]CR[fi]C[R: Joseki answer is closer. But because of the perfect extension White would have acheived, I would rather play on the left side or even cap the White for using the circle stone.]
;W[fe];B[ef];W[ff];B[fg]C[R: good sequence];W[gg];B[dg]TR[gh]
C[R: no, protect being aggresive. After White defends, Black can invade at K6]
;W[fh]TR[ji]
(;B[eg]C[R: Don't defend this atari. Is not something big as it is the White threat to make a big center wall]
;W[gh]TR[gi]CR[ji][jf]C[R: White fails to cap - triangle. Black should invade right away: circles.]
;B[ee]C[R: very small. Invasion is the Black only choice. THis way Black strengths White and nothing can be done later.]
;W[ed];B[fj]TR[ji]C[R: Another lost chance];W[hj]C[R: White caps finaly Black. So Black has like 36 points, White has like 64 points. Not bad, White can only solidify his positions and that's all. Still Black can easily invade relatively easy the rigth upper corner or right side. Also White can do it in bottom left corner.]
;B[gi]C[R: this is kind of move which gain like 2 points but loses big tactically: it forces White to close its own territory and to shut down all doors. It is like an unfair exchange: Black says give me 2 points and in exchange I promise I won;t invade you.]
;W[hi]TR[gd]
(;B[ec]TR[gd]C[R: Yet another White welcome move. See how the things would look with an aji left like the triangle]
;W[fd];B[fb];W[gb];B[fa];W[ga];B[eb];W[gc]C[R: White plays safe. Of course, WHite is in lead.]
;B[eh];W[gk];B[fk];W[gl];B[fl];W[gm];B[fm];W[jg]C[How is my reaction to the invasion? what should i had done?
R: First of all the invasion should have be done 20 moves before, not after White closed all doors. Now top Black can hope is to live small in right upper corner and to kill a response White invasion in bottom left corner. Even so, Black living in L11 and White killed at C3, Whiste would still win: Black would have around 56 points, White 60 points plus komi.]
;B[ki];W[kh];B[li];W[lj];B[ji];W[ii]SQ[kj][jj]C[R: White defends poorly. Defend the corner, there is the place Black can make life.]
;B[lh];W[lg];B[kj];W[kk]
(;B[mj]C[R: But Black commits suicide];W[lk];B[mg];W[mk]TR[lf]
C[R: White does another mistake, doesn't need to defend on last line. Black can't make eyes playing on last line.]
;B[mi];W[jh];B[lf];W[kg]TR[kc]
(;B[me]TR[ji][ki][li][lh][mg][mi][mj][kj]C[R: THis is a false eye. Values nothing. Triangled stones can be in atari, so the eye at N8 is fake. Black should have take advantage of White poor play and rise up for life.]
;W[jj];B[ld]
(;W[mh]C[R: this is a typical "rush" move. Why White is so keen to get that stones? They are dead anyway.]
;B[ke];W[mf]C[R: an useless KO, White has nothing to gain or lose. But Black can still live.]

(;B[le]C[R: Occupying own eyes: not a way to live.];W[lc];B[mc]

(;W[mb]SQ[kc]C[R: A very wrong move. Playing on last line: it should be only in last part of the game, when closing moyos.]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[je];W[ie]SQ[id]C[R: White continues to not defend.]
;B[jc];W[id];B[kb]
(;W[md]C[R: another move with no meaning.];B[lb];W[jf];B[mc]
;W[ib];B[la]C[R: Black managed to live in corner. Which would have been possible from Day 1: invasion at 3x3. But now instead of going for very small gain (at least should have been at K12), Black needs to think closing the door for White in left bottom corner. If manages to kill White there, can win the agame: Black has 10 points in front against White komi.]
;W[ja];B[ma];W[ic];B[jb]SQ[ck]C[R: Rectabgle point: Black need s to play it before White.]
;W[ia];B[mg];W[lh]SQ[ck][de]
(;B[de]C[R: Not tthat, THer is no danger there,];W[ck]C[R: ANd White strikes, It should be able to live small.]

(;B[dk]TR[fj][fk][fl][fm]C[R: WHY? Black has a wall and protecting White off that wall is like Black jumping in front of its own warriors. Is like Black prepared the line of riflemen and when White steps in fornt of it, Blacks sends the cavalry between White and own rifles.]
;W[cj];B[ci];W[bi]
(;B[di]C[R: Why protecting that cutting point? What actually can White cut?]
;W[bh];B[bg];W[ah];B[ag];W[aj];B[cl];W[bk];B[dl];W[bl]TR[bm]
C[R: What if Black plays triangle?];B[cm];W[bm];B[ch];W[kf]
;B[al];W[mf];B[cf];W[mg];B[gj];W[ka];B[hg];W[hf];B[ig];W[ih]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[R: Black commited 2 big tactical mistakes. One: allowed, supported and sometimes forced White to close a big moyo. Amd second, after White let it live in corner, didn't protect own corner.
Some moves not right, but not big mistakes. The last line should be played only for closing moyos and, rare situations, for making connections between groups.
A small advice: always ask yourself if the move about ot play is really needed. What if not doing: is there a bigger, or hotter, or simply better placed pint on table?]
