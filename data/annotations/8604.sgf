AB[pd][dp]C[A peaceful game without life&death fight.
I thought I was leading but I was wrong!
Could you tell me what were the key moves in this game?
What are my strategic mistakes?
Thank you very much!
Jerhum

*Hi there, I'm Mark. I play on many accounts, but I've been slacking off lately because my residence internet is a meanie. I've been said to be 4kyu when I don't think, but 1 dan when I do. So... Hope you enjoy my review. If you can find runaway or horseplay on KGS, that' me. There are some mistakes that I don't talk about, because I want you to focus on a few things a review.

**Good game overall. Two things:

1. You have exceptional tactics, but you strengthened your opponent too much.

2. You know the correct places to make your opponent weak, but you need to keep that weak group seperate from strong ones to profit from it. 

You are going to improve very quickly. I'm sure that with your drive, you'll get much stronger.]
;W[dd]C[kasiharu: Hi!];B[pp]C[jerhum: hi gg];W[nc]C[I am trying to apply the follow approach from http://senseis.xmp.net/:

4 questions to decide your strategy:

Q1.Do you have a weak group?
If yes, reinforce it.

Q2.Does your opponent have a weak group?
If yes, plan to attack it.

Q3.Can you make a big territorial move?
If yes, do it.

Q4.Could your opponent make a big territorial move or does s/he have a big territory?
Try to prevent, destroy or reduce it with appropriate measures.

Go through these questions in that order.

*Mark: good.];B[pf]C[Since I have read 'How Not to Play Go' (Y. Zhou), I am also trying to avoid the following mistakes:

Common Misunderstandings of How to Play Go:

1/  Following your opponent: automatically respond in the same local area as the opponent's move

2/  Not Paying attention to the whole board: local interactions ignoring much bigger possibilities elsewhere

3/  Making slow moves: automatically connecting against a peep, automatically playing atari, automatically protecting against a cut

4/  Not taking SENTE seriously enough: Sente is power and freedom. You should always find it painful to take gote

5/  The Red Eye Problem: assuming that your opponent's areas are bigger than your own. being jealous of your opponent's potential

6/  Every play involves the whole board: instead of "How do I defend against that move?", should be "Can I find somepace else to play that will be more valuable in the long run?"

7/  Wishful thinking: hoping that your opponent won't see sth that is obvious to you

8/  Not thinking: rushing to respond, especially when excited about attacking or defending in the local area]
;W[pb]C[In the beginning, I was always avoiding fights.

Later on, by applying the '4 questions to decide your strategy' made me play more and more aggresively to finally be too agressive (cf game reviews 8509 & 8514).

More recently following Y. Zhou advises, I have tried to force myself to tenuki more often, to look at the whole board, to avoid small local moves and to avoid wishful thinking.

As a consequence, I feel I play less agressively, back to my 'old' style but I also feel I am becoming too passive, avoiding *local* fights in favor of *global* moves therefore playing big moves (Q3) before attacking my opponent (Q2).

My question is: how to find the BALANCE between attacking +/- weak groups and playing big peaceful moves?]
