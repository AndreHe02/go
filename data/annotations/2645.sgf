AB[pd][dp]C[eng60340 [13k\]: thanks for playing with me
Kaistar [11k\]: np :)

okay. i will just try to comment as much as possible. the reviewer need not respond to most of my comments. :)

i just need advice to tweak my strategic thinking and also advice on my strength and weakness.
what to improve upon and how

 in the future should i mark the areas i am talking about with triangles and squares ? ( i am worried the reviewer can't see the markings made by cgoban2.)

thanks for reviewing !

ah a threat !
most of the time i would do r14.

or should i settle my Q16 first...

* R14 is ok];W[jd];B[qn]TR[hc][jd][qf][pp]C[choose to attack Q4 first. so that can settle R6 and R14 with Q10 later...

notice that can invade K16 with H17.

* you can do a shimari (c15) or attack Q4 with O3 also];W[ql]
C[ah. damn.]

originally thought of M11. decided to be greedier.
can i be even more greedy ? :)
