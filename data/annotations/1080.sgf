C[c10 is alright but to lose on white. However since there is so much difference in strength you can play a move that start to give a base and attacks white at the same time
like c11 or c8. The stone under attack will survive but the other one will be weaken.]

;W[bf];B[ch]C[b15 is better. Always make a priority to keep white separated. c13 cannot be taken by white]

and keep white stones separated];W[kj];B[ki];W[jg];B[kf];W[ij]
;B[ji];W[hg];B[ig]C[j14 is more solid. j13 helps white to play j12 in sente]

;B[jm]C[I can see this was a mistake. White next connects with the invasion stone and has no worries about a weak group anymore. Could I have corrected this mistake with my next moves?

The mistake was c8. k7 is correct here];W[jn];B[kn];W[ko];B[kl]
TR[jo]C[I should have played at triangle?

k5 and then h4 is a possibility];W[ln];B[km]TR[jo]CR[jl]C[Again, play at triangle and circle after the capture?]
;W[jo];B[lm];W[mn];B[qm]C[Is this a good move?

It is ok . At this point white is no longer on the defensive]
;W[qf];B[ne]C[o15 is too lose.
p15 or o16 are possibilities. Also r16 and r 15
Also p13 but more complicated];W[qc];B[pc]C[wrong direction. The other side is bigger]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[qg];B[og];W[gd]C[Why does white play this? The stone he saves does not seem to be important.

It destroys black shape takes one eye away and extends

It is a false eye. If white plays m2 before black, black group will be dead]

Yes this is why you lost. You lost by 27 points so this is one third. Another 6 points you lost below is already 16
and 8 points you let white take away from the upper group  is 24]

Black: 171, White: 190
Japanese count:
Black: 49, White: 7

Why did I lose? The white corners seem much larger than I expected. Also, I guess I should have made more center territory by chasing the weak white group which I let off the hook.

You played to close to white. Let white connect and surrender the four corners to white. It is difficult to comment on this game because white is much stronger than myself but  1. Do not play too close to strength
2. Seal the white groups even if  with small life
3. Do not let white connect
4. protect the corners])
