C[   Greetings and thanks for the opportunity to comment your game record. I have makred up the SGF using the SmartGo editor.

   Please understand that only a high ranking pro knows the truth about go; amateur dans like us just have random opinions only useful to stimulate each othe'rs thinking. Therefore... 

   Please enjoy my useful comments and discard my useless ones.

(;B[qo]C[B9: I think it's not proper to force white to fix his defect at R8, which this attachment exactly does. See variation.]
;W[pn];B[ql]C[A probe.

Really? I don't see it. What does this probe ask White? A probe means a move that forces the opponent to decide what he will do before he has enough information or positional definiton to make a correct choice. That isn't the case here.

Frankly, I think this move is a simple overplay. Black did not move his lower right inside stones out so this move is too early.]
;W[pl]C[W12: ok, but P4 would punish Black for not directly moving his inside stones out..]
;B[nq]C[B13: then why throw away a stone at R8?];W[qk]TR[ql]
C[I'm happy with this result because W looks like overconcentrated.

White is stronger than in the normal variation. Black lost a little bit here. The exchange of W14 and black triangle benefits White's outside.]
;B[cf]C[I considered also D14 and C11, but this looked like a good way to enter W's left side. D14 or C11 better?

   C11 is slack because splitting the side, when challenging for the corner is still possible (due to the white stone in the upper left being a 3-4 stone), is contrary to basic go theory.

   The unusual approaches of D14 and C14 both lose a little something locally (in the corner); so the cennter in the case of D14 or the side in the case of C14 must be more important than normal. I don't see it because the center and side are both wide open. Nothing special is going on.

   The proper move is C15, following the basic guideline of corner, side then center. It is preferred over D15 because this opening has shaped up to a territory style and not a moyo style, hence the 3rd line (teritory line) is preferred over the 4th line (power line).]
;W[cd]C[W16: ofcourse, at this moment there's no reason not to simply take some cash when it's offered. This is shaping up to be a cash game so far.]
;B[ci];W[ck]C[W18: keep pressure on black formation while extending off the star stone; a double purpose move! It seems Black lost a little something hereabouts.]
;B[fc]C[I played this because I think W does not have a good move here locally.

   I am sorry but I don't understand what you mean. Do you mean White cannot effectively punish you for coming close to his strong stones? He can just come out at E15 which pressures both sides while moving his inside stones out. It is good enough for White to punish you that way.

Instead of F19 it may be safer to reinforce your position on the left with E11.]
;W[fd]C[W20: this touches a potentially weak stone forcing it to become stronger. Not right. E15 is proper.]
;B[gd];W[fe]C[W22: e16 is normal.];B[ec];W[ed]C[W24: at D15 avoids empty triangle shape and add a bit more pressure against the two black left side stones.]
;B[hc]
(;W[ge]C[W26: Consider e11 to pressure the weak black left side. See variation.]
;B[he];W[hf];B[if];W[ie];B[hd];W[jd]C[W32: if Black cannot K14 now then Whie has played a severe move. If this is so, the black double hane may have been too much.]
;B[hg]C[B33: could be aji kesh by forcing white to connect instead of leaving the cutting defect, even though it force white into bad shape.]
;W[gf];B[jb];W[jf];B[ig];W[jg];B[ii];W[jh];B[gi];W[ei]C[W42: understandable but it is too early and too small. The situation is a running battle. White must help his weak center group. It is urgent. L10 is the vital point instead of E11. Black is still unsettled in the upper left.]
;B[ji]C[B43: great move.];W[dj]C[W44: cannot turn back now I guess.]
;B[lh]C[Is there better way to attack?

Maybe L15 is a nice focing move, if White cooperates by answering. Nevertheless, nothing is immediately apparent to me. I suggest you ask a professional or two what the exact potential is in this position. 

Frankly it seems to me that B45 is a fine move, sealing in the white inside stones.]
;W[le];B[lc];W[hj];B[hi];W[mc];B[ld];W[md];B[me]C[The cut looked so decious. :)

Well if you cut off a small tail and only get that it may taste like fast food instead. So be a little careful of that, in general.

Nevertheless, chopping when fighting in your own zone is natural.]

;W[of]
(;B[ng]C[Is there other alternatives?

See variation.  Nevertheless, by catching the center white group it makes your own center secure. It is a success IMHO.]
;W[og];B[oh];W[ph];B[oi];W[pi]C[I think result is still good for me because I have sente.

Well, it is expected you will end with sente. Usually the defending player lives or escapes in gote when struggling in the enemy zone.]

;W[cl];B[bf];W[bh];B[cg];W[ak];B[ae]C[There is a ko but I think I can handle it.

   It could be mi-ari mi-nashi. See variation.]
(;W[bb];B[ag]C[B95: now black is alive because of the crush tesuji, as I am sure both players realized.]

(;W[qg];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[iq]C[W100: so White imitates Black's right side movement in the earlier time.]
;B[do]C[But is there some better idea not to destroy aji at c3?

Because White has help around C8 the D5 press may not be so good.


Squeeze at L3 and just jump out; it is a brief running battle which I think Black can settle becuse of the helpers on line 11.]
;W[co];B[eo];W[cp];B[io]C[Is l3 better idea?

It takes away white base and is more valuable.  As long as the White stone and the heavy lower left black group run out together and reach safety, then Black got profit on the bottom.]
;W[lq];B[lo];W[nr];B[or];W[mr]
(;B[fl]C[I decided to play for the center moyo.

   Go is an adventure. But the corner is really valuable if you connect it seals over 10. The corner is "one move done", so that means it is urgent! 

   Because White is thick on both the left and the right, I cannot judge that a black center will compensate for the damage in the lower right corner.]
;W[pr]C[W12: of course];B[oq];W[ll];B[nl]C[B115: maybe reclaim the corner with P1?]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[mo];B[jp]C[Sequence I played was bad. Better ideas?

If you are asking me if you can catch those white stones around M8, I cannot see it. So, in general, if no urgent moves exists take the biggest public area play.  Since the whole lower right corner could become weak if undermined, it seems both urgent and big.]

Yes. Because you started an operation where you gained nothing but still ended in gote.]

[bg][bh][bi][ah][ai][hh][ih][np][op]C[What is the score now? I think the game is pretty close.

   I agree it seems close enough. Let's pretend we actually know. You should see the board marked up wih squares and Xs...

41 squares = award 43 black points.
8 white stones captured on baord = 8 more points
Black has sente which should be worth 10, so lets guess it at 10 more points
Black has around 59 then.

56 x's = award white 56points
1 black stone already captured = 1 more point
3 black stones captuerd on the board = 3 more points
White has around 60 then.

(Can anyone be awarded anything for the center. Seems like it is the dame zone at this moment.)

   IMHO, among us lowly amateurs, anything less than 10 difference is a guessing game who really is ahead.]

   Nevertheless, I think the Black opening was a bit slack and the tactics in the upper right costly; the final straw was not protecting the lower right corner. In the end Black secured 7  points in the center area but the corner shrank at least that.

   Just the same, I could tell both players were having a good time playing this game, and in my view that is really what the go game is all about for us amateurs.
