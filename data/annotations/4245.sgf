C[Hi, thank you for submitting your game to the GTL; I enjoy making reviews and learn alot from them. If you have not already done so, consider listing yourself as available for reviews, you gain valuable experience in thinking positions trough carefully and formulating strategy in words (which helps your own understanding of it).

Most of my comments are at move 91, the move where you entered white's moyo]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pc];W[cd];B[qi];W[ec];B[dj];W[ip];B[jd]C[This is a somewhat unorthodox move. I can see it making some sense in that you're trying to make the double-wing formation from the q17 stone, but you really need to back up the d10 stone. What if white now gets to play around c7-c8?]
;W[pe];B[of]C[Again pretty unorthodox. More reasonable here would be o16, taking the top.]

(;W[hq];B[cn];W[fp];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[en];B[em]C[Until you played the e7 stone, this was a good result for black. You get the corner, and a stable group that g15 can run to if white attacks it. I can see the thinking behind the e7 stone; extend your own moyo while limiting the opponents. But when you attach, you always make the opponent stronger; such moves are better saved for when you're defending safe territory from reduction. In this case it is white that is defending, and he welcomes close plays like this that will make him stronger.]

[nd][od][ke][if][jf][lf][lg]SQ[mm][gn][mo]C[> The moyo seemed to be very big for me and i wanted to invade but my trial was very weak. What can be done in such a situation.

First of all, you need to stop and consider the balance of territory. Will white win if he can turn the moyo into territory, or do you have as much elswhere? If you do, no need to panic.

If you have to invade/reduce drastically, you need to look at what stones can be attacked, and where you can run to to connect or make life when you are attacked.

There are two obvious routes in to/out of the white moyo; from the top right or the top left. Also, you can attack the m13 group which have no eyes, and use the peeps at n5/n7 and g6

In this case, you probably have to reduce him pretty good without losing any territory on the left side. Playing in from the left is a good idea, but this stone is too deep; it gets cut off from the left side, and thus fails. g9 or h9 would be more appropriate. Another possibility is to play in from the right and at the same time threaten the m13 stones (which white probably has considered connected to o10 trough sente moves threatening your right territory). A move like n11 would probably do the trick. Lastly, you can play in the middle, using the right and left exits as miai, by playing k9 or k10.

You will note how the reducing plays (circle marked) make a neat line between your two exit points. It is unreasonable to play below this line; you have to accept that white will get _something_ for his solid position.]
;W[gk];B[fl];W[gl]
(;B[gm]C[This doesn't help you, as the two white stones can too easilly escape up left or up right. Playing f6 then f5 gives you some gain atleast.]
;W[fn];B[hm];W[hj]
(;B[hk]C[This reduces liberties for your group (which will need them should the invasion end in a semeai) and strenghtens white. Play more losely, try to accomplish several things with one move. A play like k9 would both make shape for later eyes, have a better chance of threatening the g9 stones, and gets you further towards a possible escape to the right.]
;W[gi];B[fj];W[gj];B[ij]C[This gives white perfect shape, with no gain for you. (White must answer at j11)]
;W[mi]
(;B[nj]C[This makes white more solid, and makes sure that you can't use the threat of escape to make eyes in the center later. Better to exploit that white didn't play j11 by playing the point yourself.]
;W[mj];B[mk];W[ml];B[lk];W[km];B[kl];W[jl]

;B[ls];W[js];B[mr]C[This seems like an instinctive move; try to read out more. What happens if you play m2 or m3 to protect instead? The l4 cut is glaring, and I'd play m3 to give me an edge in the ensuing fight.]
;W[kp];B[ko];W[lp];B[iq];W[ir]

[as][bs][cs][ds][es]C[>This is my first post to GTL. I do not know whether my few comments are enough or not. Generally I would like to be commented on how to invade moyos. and more importantly how to avoid them. Because in many of my matches, opponent's moyo become too big and i couldnt invade usually in such cases.

Do not be afraid of moyos. They are often smaller than they appear, especially in the center. Practice making positional judgements, and try and see how little remains after you make sente reducements from the outside. Never panic and make deep invasions; you might succeed, but when you do it is only because of the opponents error, and you will not have learned anything.

When they do appear, when the opponent looks like he's ahead on territory with a large moyo, stop and carefully think trough all your options and exits. Look for weak groups of the opponent that you can threaten, and check if you should cut or peep at his cutting points. Look for exit routes, and miai points.


Another point, not specific to moyos, is to try to play moves that serve several purposes at once. Almost all your bad moves are moves that bluntly threatens one thing and one thing only, where white can, by simply answering, defuse the situation and have your move wasted.
