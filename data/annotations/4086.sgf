;B[nc];W[qg]C[White R13 is a bit too far, it is better to play white R14]
;B[kd]
(;W[pn]C[I think white should try to attack at F17 or something like that first (see variations)]
;B[pl]C[vernon: I was afraid of a giant white moya here, so I used a pincer.

david: Well, I think black should better play something like O4, if white then makes big moyo on right side, black can do the same on bottom, so it's even.]
;W[nn];B[np]
(;W[ln]C[I think this move is not good, white should pincer at R10]
;B[pi]C[vernon: I let the heat off the Q6 group in order to settle both of my pinching groups.

david: we can see clearly how white M6 was bad, white has now to protect his top right, compare to the previous variation where white pincer at R10, the difference is huge]
;W[oh];B[ph]C[vernon: Probably correct is P11. However, I thought that the cut at P13 could escape to the L16 group, and splitting the upper right white corner into two weak groups was worth it. I think I was right.]
;W[pg];B[og];W[nh];B[nf]C[vernon: The cut escapes.];W[ri]C[vernon: But at the risk of the Q8 group coming under severe attack. White steals the base here.

david: I think q8 group isn't really in danger, it's true white can try to steal the base, but black can escape to the center, menacing at the same time to capture the o12 group]
;B[rj];W[rh]C[maybe white can try to play R10 instead and fight]
;B[qk]C[vernon: My thought here was that I could make eyes with either R11 or R7.]

(;W[oj]C[vernon: See variation for possible attack];B[rm]C[vernon: This not only makes an eye but threatens to connect to Q4.]
;W[cf]C[vernon: White then uses sente to extend a large left side territory.]
;B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[lp];B[qn]C[vernon: Here I debated between this move, which connects the corner and the right side, and J4, which devastates the lower side territory potential of white, but which allows the attack on the corner and right side.

david: I would probably play J4];W[gp]C[vernon: And white takes advantage of the sente to stretch out.]
;B[nl]C[vernon: But because the but is good, Black can exert power to squeeze the weak P12 group.]
;W[lr];B[gq]C[vernon: I felt that if I defended the lower right corner with O2, White could play G3 to build a large moya.

david: yes O2 is not really nice, now you could also play G3 at H3]
;W[hp];B[mq];W[lq];B[id]C[vernon: I wrestled with whether to extend to N2, push with H3 or play here at J16. I decided that I needed a big upper side territory to counter the left side.

david: in the 3 choices you had, J16 was the best, however, I would play black Q18 first to menace white corner, then you could play J16. You can also extend from O8 to menace the 3 white stones]
;W[os]
(;B[or];W[ns];B[qr]C[vernon: The monkey jump cost around 5 to 10 points, but the upper side was more, IMHO.]
;W[lj]C[black missed a chance to attack here];B[ll]C[soft move, maybe black should try to attack at n10]
;W[lg]
(;B[lf]C[contact play is not very good, maybe play black L14 (see variation)]
;W[kg];B[kf];W[jg]C[vernon: White's P12 gets away, but Black gets territory.]

(;B[km]C[vernon: I was concerned about the solidity of the connections out to M8, so this move does two things: it prepares for K9 and also guards the gap at N8. I have no doubt that it is too slow for a stronger player. White's response builds nice territory. See variation for wild attack that does not work.

david: the problem was earlier with black M14. black could attack at Q18 (white should reply so it's almost sente). Then black can play move at F13, extending toward center, and menacing to encircle white group, and later try to attack the white left side

like you said, the variation doesn't work];W[kn];B[jk]C[Small move, play G13 or something like that instead]
;W[hq]C[vernon: Had white defended the P12 group, I was planning on playing at H3. Whether or not it is good play, we were thinking along the same lines.

david: H3 is not so big at this moment, the game will be decided on what happen between the white left side and the white center group. I would say H3 is a mistake as now black can put more pressure to the white center group]
;B[ji]C[vernon: White used his turn to firm up territory, so Black uses sente for a strong attack on P12.

david: good idea, but not good implementation, K11 is not really attacking efficiently, white will just jump to connect on left side, play something like black G13 instead]
;W[gh]C[more strong at H13];B[hh];W[ih]
(;B[ii]C[black can try H13, see possible variation];W[hg];B[hi]
;W[fg];B[jn];W[jo];B[in];W[io]
(;B[gi]C[vernon: I had run out of ideas for how to make this territory a maximal size or attack white effectively. See variation for a possible attack.

david: White seems ahead, black must attack top right corner as it is almost sente, and try to reduce white as much as possible]
;W[fi];B[fp]C[vernon: I decided to push out into the center because the white wall has a firm corner at F13.

david: too small];W[fj]
(;B[hk]C[vernon: With the next move, white seals the upper right corner. I had been looking at jumping into this upper right corner for some time, but was worried that the counter attack would cut off the stones at P13 and O14. See variation, which looks better for black.

david: H9 gives nothing to black... it is a lost move.];W[oc]
C[black opportunity to attack the corner is lost... White has much chances to win the game, however it is still too close to decide.]
;B[nd];W[jc]
(;B[kc]C[vernon: I decided to attack instead of block. Blocking would give white a chance at life. See variation.]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[fo]C[White lost sente in a critical moment. white can play B17, H6, P18]
;B[on]C[vernon: Here begins a misguided attack. I thought Q6 was weak enough to catch, but my own surroundings are too weak to sustain the attack.

david: very bad move];W[om];B[oo];W[ol]C[vernon: I had not anticipated this response.]
