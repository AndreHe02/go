C[Hi...
I'm Chun-Kit, your reviewer, currently 10k at KGS (nick: rika)

The game was requested by barry (18k* at IGS) playing white.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[id];W[dc]CR[hc]C[Personally I don't like this move. If you want to add a stone in the corner, play D18 (joseki follow up) and you have still the option to do something at H17.]
;B[cn]
(;W[fq]C[Here a pincer at C8 is where I usually play. It's a nice extention from the upper left stones.]
;B[dj]
(;W[dl]C[here the same as the upper left...
first B4 and if he doesn't answer invade at C8 (see var)

but in general C8 is also an option (see var)];B[cl];W[ck];B[dm]

;W[fo];B[en];W[fn];B[jp]MA[fn][fo][fp][fq]C[this is good by black, white hasn't made an extention with the wall (X)]
;W[em];B[dn];W[ie];B[pj]TR[id]C[black took the initiative to play the final biggest move on the board (a ladder breaker for J16 !!!)
now you are facing a san-ren-sei situation on the right side.
let's take a look of the score so far:  black: upper left 2, lower left: 20, prisoners: 8 + lots of potential in the right side
white: upper left ~16 + prisoners: 10 + lots of potenial points in the center]
;W[qf]SQ[nc]C[better approach and extend from O17];B[nc]C[black reduces the potential points of white in the top]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[of]SQ[qh]C[easier with R12 (first make a base -> 1 1/2 eye sure)]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[qg];W[pg];B[ph];W[oh];B[pi]C[here the result not making a base first: black gains the right side]

(;W[im]C[very difficult to play a contact move you allow black to get stronger]
;B[jn];W[km];B[jm];W[jl];B[hm]TR[im]C[remember: this stone was the contact play]
;W[il];B[gm];W[hn];B[hp];W[gn]SQ[ho]C[bamboo (H5) is better]
;B[hq]
(;W[fm]C[better G8 (see var)];B[hr];W[ir];B[kl];W[ll];B[kk]
;W[lm];B[hk]C[geta
The presence of the white wall has no effect now, however you manage to kill the N4 group]

;W[om];B[pm];W[on]
(;B[nm];W[pl];B[qm]
(;W[ol]C[no need to connect now, reduce black right side];B[ml]
;W[mm];B[lk]
(;W[nn]C[no need to hurry remove that stone. you can capture N8 or O7 later, after reducing the black territory in the right
(N5 and O6 are miai)];B[mk];W[ln]LB[ql:3][jo:1][mo:2]MA[ll]
[km][lm][kn][ln][ko]C[this move just reduces your liberties of the L5 group (marked with X)  to 2, so black can force you to capture or connect with O7 and secure his right territory.
As you can see black's next move is sente (white must answer) and pushed you.]
;B[mr];W[mq];B[ns];W[lr];B[ql];W[lh];B[kd];W[jd];B[kf]
(;W[ma]SQ[ih]CR[ia][sg]C[pretty odd... a monkey jump is used to reduce the opponent's territory... but you can still gain some points with M17 (hoping cutting the L16 and L14 off)
but at this stage white is much behind, so killing a group is now very difficult to change the outcome of the game
the next moves are small
well actually, it's difficult to comment what to do now...
I would take some sente moves like the marked circles
or solify your territory like the rectangle mark];B[mb];W[la]
;B[lb];W[na];B[ob];W[kc];B[lc];W[ld];B[ke];W[me];B[nf];W[mf]
;B[le];W[md];B[ng]C[now you have to deal with two weak groups, difficult to save one of them]

(;W[lg];B[og];W[pf];B[ne];W[se];B[jg];W[jh];B[ih];W[sc];B[sb]
C[not good by black, cross cut at wJ13 kills the 5 stones]
(;W[kg]C[see variation how to kill L14 (still not enough to change the outcome of the game)]
;B[if];W[hf];B[hc];W[hg];B[ig];W[hb];B[gj];W[ia];B[ga];W[sg]
;B[rh];W[sh];B[si];W[sf];B[ri];W[ms];B[fl];W[aj]MA[ah][ch][eh]
[fi]C[well, if I'm pretty much behind I become frustrated and play that kind of move, too :)  In fact, black cannot cut you apart, because he first needs to connect at C12 A12,  and E12 F11]

;B[ps];W[gi];B[hi];W[gh];B[mh];W[lf];B[jf];W[fj];B[oa];W[kb]
;B[ho];W[jo];B[io]C[so overall:
the difference of the game is white didn't manage to kill the black upper left group although black hasn't played that good himself in a life and death situation
it's better for white to play more extentions to the corner (pincer in the lower left, approach upper right)
it's useful to count your liberties vs. how many moves you need to remove dead stones  look for big moves and surely you will gain strength.

Good luck with your games!!!
