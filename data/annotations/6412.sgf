C[This is a game I  played as white on KGS.
I think that I have made some mistakes in the opening and in the midgame, but I could not find the key-points so I'm longing for any comments to understand where I have lost the game.

XCM: Hiya, this is XCMeijin here! I hope that you'll find my comments helpful for your contimuing improvement in go!]

(;W[aq]LB[do:A]C[XCM: This is not important. Playing the bulge at A is much more vital. See variation.]

(;W[or]C[XCM: At the current stage this move is very small. I believe you should leave it and play elsewhere. See variation.]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[jq];W[ko];B[io];W[qg]C[XCM: This is OK, but maybe you can go out a little further. R10 would look much better undewr these circumstances.]

(;W[hd]LB[gb:A][mb:B]C[XCM: Not the right way to cut your losses. As you see black plays K17 next in the game and threatend to jeopardise both sides of your territory A and B. See variations.]

;B[dn]C[XCM: This move is a big problem for you. White is confined to the corner. You should have come out when you still had the chance, which is why i said eariler you needed to play D5.]
;W[nk]C[XCM: Much too small. Remember to lok for moves that expand your area and/or reduces that of your opponent.]
;B[hb]C[XCM: Big move. you must defend. Keep an eye out for moves like these.]

[rr][sr][es][fs][gs][hs][is][ss]C[XCM: Here are some of the main points about your game:

1/ Look for moves that increase your territory and decrease your oppoonents, especially in the opening. 

2/ Watch your cutting points. Sometimes you cannot ignore moves that your opponent makes.

3/ Try not to get confined, play dynamically, not defensively.

I suggest you try out the problems on goproblems.com, particularly thoe regarding life and death, opening moves and tesuji. You should study Fuseki and Joseki as a secondary task.

I hope you found my comments helpful. But please, next time you submit a review, add in your own questions in the game record! It is hard for me to know what you are worried most about if you do not put in detailed questions.
