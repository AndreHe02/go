What does I need to improve?
What am I weakest at ?
what is my strongpoint?
How can improve my weaknesses?

Hi :D.

Well in general i think you need to learn how to decide which move is the biggest (especially important for the opening). Just play through in your head the major possibilites and compare, but also try to think of a follow up move and not just stone. Especially those moves that have multiple purposes are good (in mid game, opening, in the yose there won't be many of those left i guess ^^). E.g. a move that attacks your opponent and enlargends your framework or threatens to connect your groups (always good as you can play a bit more freely then, as you don't have to worry about life and death matters). I'd suggest that for the opening you try to read out at least 3 different moves (just the first few follow up moves though). Your endgame was quite okay i'd say. There were some mistakes, but i guess they aren't that relevant at your level. I'd generally say that your strongest point is that your groups are always very stable, it might also be a bit of a disadvantage sometimes as they might be even a bit more stable than necessary :9. And keep on watching high dan games, that always helps : ) (even though you don't understand everything, who does by the way anyway? ^^Â°). 

I hope I can help you with that review at least a little bit, have a nice evening and bye

(;B[kp]LB[cp:C][jp:B][kp:A]C[Is k4 better than l4?

To directly play k4 isn't the best option in my opinion. It's really far away and it also doesn't threaten e4 in any way so white could easily invade at m4 (or any other move that has the same purpose)then.

You could have also attacked white first though];W[jq]

i guess so : )];W[hd];B[le];W[ei];B[jd]C[i like this move : ) white totally tried to ignore it's flaws and you tried to get some points out of it. White's top eventually would have been huge without any intervention...]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[if];B[el]C[Is f9 a good move instead of e8

i guess f9 would have been better than e8. e8 isn't really doing much so perhaps you could have even played something in the j11 area (to hinder white from building a framework and simultanously threatening to expand yours from the right side) or you could have attacked n17. that group is still really weak too.]

J10 is possible i'd say AND better as it reduces white's territory quite a bit more than K9 does. Now playing something like K4 might also be advantageous or B4, B18 etc...]
