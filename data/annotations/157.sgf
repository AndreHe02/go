This  move at N9 is neither sente nor does it block a sente move of his, nor does  it grab much secure territory.  At this crucial stage of the game this is  bad; this may be the losing move.                                          Your first priority should be to look for sente moves.  If they can  eliminate/block a sente move of his, so much the better.  M5 is such a move.                      Next priority after sente moves are blocking his sente  moves.  G14 would block a dangerous move of his.  (since he can make F16, F15  at any time.)]

;W[me];B[nd];W[ne];B[oe];W[ki];B[kk];W[mi];B[nn]C[O6 is not so  good.   It worked out as gote for you.  There are sente sequences, such as  F2, E1 or          S9 or B10 or M4, L3.  You could do all of those in sente  before you make a gote move.]

;W[og];B[ph]L[oi]C[better a ? Yes, but O12 is even better  because he would block at N12 and you would play perhaps O11.   There are  better moves available.  P5 for example is sente.  M6 is an important  blocking move.  After M6 you aim for M4 and M1.]
