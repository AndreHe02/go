C[I'm woldsom, white, playing an even game against kenyama, a fellow kgs 7k

Thanks in advance for reviewing my game

Hi, I'm phenomene, 1k in France, and I'll do my best to review your game. I may comment on both white's and black's moves, because it helps to understand the whole flow of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq]
(;W[fp]C[This move is unusual. Strong players tend to dislike attaching like this right from the beginning, because it makes the opponent stronger. Attaching moves are mainly used for defence, to settle a position. Here white was first in this corner so he may prefer to keep the black stone weak.
See the variation for a more usual opening. However there is no way to prove your move is actually bad and I think this way of playing is feasible. The essential is to play an opening that suits your style.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[jq];W[dj]LB[ci:B][cj:X][ej:A][dn:X]
[ep:C][gq:D][hq:X]TR[jq]C[I play this opening alot, at first simply so I could play out a fuseki experiment I had by replying to f17 with e15, but it seems to do well on it's own. What's the orthodox move here? d6? c10?

The d10 move is a must here. Very good move. Playing d10 at c10 isn't consistent with the idea of building a moyo, as it leaves a perfect capping play at A. If white plays d10 at d6 black can easily establish a stable position on the side by playing at B, and white has gained nothing from his attaching move.

A move at d6 would be needed if black could cut at C, but in fact he can't because of his own weakness at D. This is not easy to see but I put a variation for reference. Don't confuse this situation with the one where k3 is located at h3 ; then d6 becomes necessary, because D is no longer a weakness.]

(;B[oq]LB[fc:X][ee:X]C[This move looks too slow, it is too close to black's strong group and too low. The usual idea here would be to play an approach move at f17 to limit the size of white's moyo. White would probably pincer this stone. A move at e15 in answer to f17, as you suggest, is possible too, to enlarge the moyo, altough a bit risky because it puts all your eggs in the same basket (one big territory strategy).]
;W[nc]LB[qj:A]C[Good move. It is also possible to play directly at k16 to prevent black from pincering and be sure to build a big moyo. Or if you don't like big moyo games, a splitting move at A should be reasonable too.]
;B[pf];W[ne]LB[jd:X]C[This move doesn't respect opening theory. There is a basic principle : first, corners, second, sides, third, center. Here k16 must be played before o15. Now black can play an annoying wedging move and o15 will be inefficient (see variation).]

(;B[pj]LB[cc:A][jd:X][qh:C][oo:B]C[This seems so big for black, should I have played on the right edge instead of o17?

No, in fact black failed to punish your mistake and you have time to play the last big point at k16 now.

I noticed some players often become very anxious as soon as their opponent is building a big moyo. They seem to forget that they may build something bigger at the same time. Here you have both f5 and o15 key points on the boundary, so your moyo is broader than black's if you play at k16. It is true it is more open (the 3-3 point invasion at A is attractive now), but even black's moyo isn't solid territory. The usual reducing point for a corner enclosure with a double wing extension like this is at B.  B is also the key point for black to solidify the moyo. Later you might be able to invade around C too.

A good advice is not to be too jealous when ones plays go. Both players have the right to make territory and it is enough to have just one point more than the other at the end. When ones becomes jealous, he may invade everywhere, but then he just creates weak groups, and helps the opponent. This will be the leitmotiv of the commentary which follows.

To come back to the game, the problem is that white almost lost one move with o15, and it compensates for black's slow move at p3. Had white played at k16 directly instead of o15, black q10 next would be normal. Then white would have sente to reduce at B, which seems to be the biggest point on the board (imagine a black stone at B). In the actual game white has no choice but to play k16 anyway.]
;W[go];B[hp]LB[dn:C][ep:A][gq:B]TR[go]C[This exchange seems sente and helps white to enlarge his moyo but... Remember that black can't cut at A as long as he has a weakness at B. The marked exchange helps black to protect his cutting point. Now A is a real threat and pushing and cutting here can help black to destroy the moyo. If white plays at C to prevent that, the intended forcing move becomes gote and black will play first on the wide open upper side.

The basic principle here is : "Don't help your opponent to protect his own weaknesses".]

(;W[pm]LB[ic:A][jd:X][oo:B]C[What else can I do at this point?

First don't lose your temper, play at k16 and the game will still be close. There are 9 lines between d16 and o17, and only 5 lines between r4 and q10. The upper side is bigger. As white q7 doesn't threaten anything (black is strong in this area), black can ignore it and play at A. Please compare with a white move at k16.

From a local point of view now, the usual reducing move in a double-winged formation like this is at B. It reduces  both the lower side and right side, and it is easier to settle a stone at B than at q7. I give two variations as examples.]
;B[qk];W[po];B[pp];W[ph]LB[mm:A]TR[pm][po]CR[nc][ne]C[felt it was a safe reducing move at the time

This move definitely can't be played now. This is not consistent with the two preceding white moves. Those stones are still very weak, and by invading just next to them white will have to defend against a very severe double attack. It may even become a triple attack as there is another group without clear base on the upper side.

Instead of this invasion it was necessary to jump out around A. Remember that you don't have to destroy any territory yout opponent is trying to make! The q12 move is unecessary jealous.]
;B[og]C[but black is not afraid.

Black runs into the center, separating white groups, a very natural move.]
;W[oi];B[oj];W[ni];B[nj]LB[mi:B][mk:A][mm:C]C[Black could go faster and play at A, then it would be very hard for the two stones below. But still in the game white is in big trouble as he should play both B and C.]
;W[nn]LB[mi:A]C[alternatives?

Locally A is the only move but I understand you want to save your two stones. A black hane at A being unberable, we see that q12 was a very big mistake.]
;B[mi]C[Ouch!];W[nh]LB[mf:A]C[clumsy shape, but I see no alternative

The triple attack is terrible now if black plays at A. It is well possible that one white group dies later.]
;B[ng]LB[mf:A]C[Black tends to play too close to his target, A is better. Still not easy for white however.]
;W[mh];B[li];W[mg]
(;B[pb]C[I think black plays an overly defensive move here. White is far weaker than black, he can't kill the corner (see variation).]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[rf]LB[le:A]C[This is not a good idea to create a fourth weak group. This stone is not connected to q12. It was safer to connect two weak groups with a move at A, and if black had a move to take a small corner, white can defend at the bottom.

In the middle game be careful not to create too many groups or the situation will be out of control.]
;B[qg]
(;W[rc]C[alternatives here? Can I r12?

A move at r12 helps black to capture the two stones with s13, but this may not be a bad idea : white mustn't try to  save everything or he will lose. See variation.]
;B[qh];W[qb]C[Not sure if I needed this to live, but it gives that extra edge

This is necessary to live.];B[od];W[nd]LB[md:A]TR[od]C[I was ok by this. I get safe life, and a bit more thickness on the outside, even if it was gote.

Very bad exchange for black : his stone makes an empty triangle and adds nothing to his position, and white is now stronger. If black wants to peep here he should peep from the outside, at A.]
;B[mf];W[lf];B[nf];W[le];B[qf]C[Black afraid of q13??

It seems so, but q13 leads to nothing. This move is not necessary.]
;W[qd];B[jd]
(;W[kd]LB[me:B][kh:A]C[It is usually a bad idea to attach to weak stones as it helps to make them stronger. The usual idea instead would be to protect the cut at A. White needn't to be too afraid of the cut at B, see the variation.]
;B[je];W[kg]C[Good move : at least white connected two groups (and separated black)!]
;B[fd];W[ec]LB[df:A]C[There is no reason not to play the normal move at A. When black plays a high approach move, he emphasize the center and is not interested with the corner territory. No need to defend it.]
;B[fc];W[df]LB[cc:A]TR[ec][fc]C[This exchange is bad for white as black is stronger and the corner can still be invaded at A. Because of the l16 and e17 moves, white failed to keep the black group weak. Now white is the only one with weak groups on the board, it won't be fun to fight.]
;B[ig]LB[ch:A]C[Very good move : it reinforces black, attacks white and tends to push him toward his other weak group. Moreover it can later help to save an invasion around A.]
;W[mj]LB[ob:B][jh:A]C[Definetely not possible. White must not create a new weak group. This cut leeds to nothing as it cuts strong groups apart (q10 is connected to r12). White should consider escaping at A or threatening to connect and making eye shape at B.]
;B[ji]C[Good move : white is enclosed and black is super strong to attack the bottom group.]
;W[lj]C[wrong aproach to the problem?

Definetely yes. Don't try to save everything, this n10 stone has no strategic meaning, it is not important to save it.]
;B[kj];W[lh]C[wanted that half-eye];B[ki];W[ml]C[m8?

Locally it is correct shape to save the two stones, but they are small. At least this move helps the bottom group a little. There is still the problem of the upper group...]
;B[kk]C[I felt so thin here, was sure I'd die before I could do anything if I played m8 or n9]
;W[mp]C[Good. This defends the main part of the group and not the useless two stones.]
;B[mk]C[This is a small capture, black could attack the upper group instead. The two stones don't help white to make eyes, they have no strategic meaning.]
;W[jp];B[kq];W[ko];B[ho]LB[ep:A]C[Black is threatening the cut at A seriously now. See how the player who make weak groups is bullied everywhere on the board while he defends. In the end, even if he doesn't lose a group, he may have no territory.

On the contrary, by attacking, black made the lower side a safe territory and with the cut at A he can reduce the left side significantly.]
;W[ll];B[lk];W[ql];B[qo];W[rl]LB[qn:A]C[A move at A is better to make eye shape. The problem here is to live, not to take a few points more.]
;B[kc]C[Now the other attack... White has no time to breath.]
;W[lc];B[kb];W[lb];B[ob]C[Probably white should have played here before. Now he is in great danger.]

(;B[dn]C[black can kill with l15 here? luckilly he didn't see it, and I left it alone

Yes white has only one eye (see variation).];W[do];B[cn];W[ke]
LB[jc:A]C[chickened out.

There is still some ko aji if black plays at k13 but now the cut at A captures two stones so white is alive. Black lost a golden opportunity to end the game quickly, but still having to ignore c6 is terrible. Black b4 now helps black to make a base, and destroy both white's base and territory.]
;B[bp]C[can I still live in the corner? b3?

Very good move. Now b3 is normal but it makes only one eye and white will still have to run into the center.]
;W[hn];B[in];W[hm]LB[fm:A][gm:B][im:C]C[Bad shape, Black can peep at A. Correct shape is B, which can be followed-up by C or a connection with the left side.]
;B[im]LB[fm:A]C[Black should destroy eye shape at A first.]
;W[hl]LB[fm:A]C[White must make shape at A first too.];B[cc]
LB[io:A]TR[im][in]C[looking for a way to take advantage of the j5 cutting point.

This invasion is very big but I don't think the timing is correct : white is not out of trouble at the bottom.

The cutting point at A is not such a burden on black as he has only strong groups nearby. At worst he can sacrifice two stones if he needs to.]
;W[cd];B[eb];W[dc];B[db];W[cb];B[bc]LB[bb:A]C[Wrong move, white A captures black, and in fact A is the correct play for black too, to steal points in the corner. But this is far too small and the action is still at the bottom with several unsettled groups. Here it is only endgame.]
;W[bb];B[dh]LB[bj:B][cl:A]TR[cn][dn][bp]C[Now it is black who invades with a weak group around, he does not need that. A move at A instead would be safe and would threaten to take away white's territory safely with B next.

The upper left side is white's only sizeable territory, black is well ahead and should not take risks. Now the game is thrown into confusion.]
;W[ch]C[Usually it is not good to attach to a weak stone but maybe here it is ok, as white can't attack it strongly because of the black wall in the center.]
;B[dg];W[cg]TR[dg]C[This exchange is terrible for black, it is forbidden to play like this. It only helps white to solidify his territory, and the hane at the head of two stones is unbearable. Black had to play hane above or below c12.]
;B[cf];W[bf];B[di];W[ci];B[ef];W[de];B[ck]C[Now white has solid territory and this move doesn't threaten to slide anymore.]
;W[ej];B[cq]C[ouch my corner! guess it wasn't that big at this point; seemed to me that black had used more moves there than he'd gotten points for it

This is very big because it gives definite life to the black group and take away any base in the corner for white. Moreover it has a big follow-up at d2.]
;W[eg]LB[fm:A]C[Black indeed has a shortage of liberties but taking three stones in gote is small. It is urgent to defend the eyeless group at the bottom.]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[fh]C[not sure how to take advantage further]
;W[ie]LB[jc:A][fm:B]C[my inability to read it out makes me play and find out :/

It is a bad habit to play without reading, because playing sequences that don't work erases other sequences which does work. I agree the situation here is very complicated. Still there is a danger that white loses his big endgame move at A during the fight (A is even necessary for the unconditionnal life of the white group).

This being said, I think B is more urgent than ever and there is no time to fight above anyway.]
;B[id];W[he];B[hd]LB[jc:A][jg:B]C[Now A is protected and black B become troublesome (see variation.)]

Rather you have been being in danger for a long time, perhaps without realizing it till now.

Maybe white should have played at A with his last move ; it gives more chances to live.]
;B[ek]C[expected c10];W[dk];B[dl];W[cj];B[em]LB[fm:A]C[more trouble than ever :/

Indeed... Playing c10 at A would defend the important stones, not the three useless ones. Black e7 at A would be terrible.]

It is good spirit to want to attack, but here black has not any weak group and you are the one attacked. So you are forced to defend.]

The r10 move is close to a pass. It does nothing. White should try to kill with f6 followed by k10. He may be still ahead, but if he plays other meaningless moves the game may become close.

White can play o1 in sente anytime and it is too early to take gote here for black. The life and death status of the center white groups is still unclear.]

The usual answer in endgame is the solid connection at s15. Sometimes t15 is better, for eye shape for instance. But t14 is hardly ever played, because it would give t13 in sente to black. So your choice was correct.]

(;B[jj]C[This looks troublesome but black made a mistake in order.]
;W[en]C[White lives. But black could have playd f6 in sente before k10 and then a big ko on the life on this big group was inevitable (see variation).

In short black lost many opportunities and the game may have become close. Let's do a approximate count.

Black : 22 points lower side, 10 points left side, 14 points upper side, 5 points right side, for a total of about 51 points.

White : 20 points upper left, 5 points lower left, 2 points lower right, 8 points upper right, 5 points upper side, 6,5 komi, for a total of about 46,5 points.

I counted quickly thinking about probable future endgames moves, so these values may be off by a few points. Black is a bit ahead, but white still has a chance.]

The marked stones exchange is bad for black if he doesn't connect. But p12 is indeed bigger and black could have played it before r19.

The endgame is a very technical and acurate phase of the game, so it is not easy to give the best sequence. A very important thing is the sente/gote relation. Roughly speaking, moves which are sente for both sides should be played early, and moves which are sente for one side are worth twice moves which are gote for both.

There is no big move remaining, and no double sente move either. The upper left may seem big at first sight but because of shortage of liberties no one can make anything big here. The biggest move may be n18 now. White has sente moves at c5 and h13 he can play first. After n18 black may exchange n15 for n16, then fight the ko in the center.]

Is there some deep or basic concept I'm missing, that can help me take control of a game like this? I felt pushed around right from the start. Was this ALL caused by a bad fuseki choice?

First, this was a nice game with a lot of fighting. Unfortunately the fight was one-sided and white was always the target. The basic concept you need to apply is not to create several weak groups at the same time. This is more a middle game principle than a bad fuseki choice. Don't be afraid of letting your opponent take some points, destroy less and build more for yourself instead. The burden to have eyless groups is far worst than giving some territory to the opponent. Even without killing anything, it is easy to make/destroy territory by attacking weak groups, as we see in this game. Black failed to kill several times but was still well ahead, and the game became closer only because of some very slow moves in the end.

Maybe big moyo games are a bit difficult to handle and you may want to try for small territories games instead, for instance by playing f4 as a pincer at the very beginning, or by playing o17 at r10. But this is just a matter of taste, there are various reasonable fuseki choices. Maybe try for several things and chose the one you prefer later.

The biggest mistakes in this game were the moves which create new weak groups for white : q12, s14, n10.]

There are many variations and maybe this one is a bit complicated, but usually after p5 white can always settle himself one way or another.]

;B[dc];W[ap]C[Now black can as well resign.

This variation was quite complicated, there is no need to learn it by heart, but it proves that the d6 move is useless as long as black hasn't protected his own cutting point.

The key move in this sequence is the d2 tesuji, to gain liberties and create a double threat. This move appears in many similar situations.]

(;W[cn];B[kq];W[qj]LB[iq:A]C[This opening is very popular nowadays and is call the mini-chinese fuseki. Black tries to form a moyo and white r10 move limits its development. Notice how black's position on the side is not as strong as in your game. Later, white may easily invade at A for instance, because f3 wasn't reinforced by a contact move.

If you don't like to let black building a moyo, you can pincer the f3 stone directly (instead of c6), or you can ignore f3 and play an approach move in the lower-right corner. None of these moves reinforce the f3 stone.]
