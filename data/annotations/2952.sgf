RE[W+14.5]

C[z: Review requested by black (zenjutsu, 9k* on IGS).

z: I am sincerely very appreciative of the reviewer's willingness to spend time helping me improve my weaknesses.  While I've added some post-game comments and questions (marked w/ "z:"), any feedback from reviewer is greatly appreciated.  I am certain the reviewer's eye for errors will be far better than mine.  Thank you for your time!

r: the reviewer's comment are marked "r:".]PL[B];B[qd];W[pp]
;B[dc];W[cp];B[qn];W[rp]C[z: I don't know this W move as joseki, but I didn't know how to punish.  Is this joseki?  It isn't in Kogo's.

r: S4 is uncommon but playable in some cases. S5 is more common than S4. B can treat R6 as a forcing move and play Q10 as you did with the intent of making territory at the top. Alternatively, if B likes to play agressively, O3 is a possible answer.]
;B[pj]C[r: Q10 works well with R16.];W[mp];B[od]C[r: Good.]
;W[di]
(;B[ep]C[z: I'm not happy w/ this stone.  Should I have continued to focus on my own moyo  at this point?  I'm not clear on when I should shift from "building my own moyo" to "invading the opponent".

r: this is a question of personal playing style. Takemiya would answer "build my own moyo", but invading is also possible. However invading at H3 is easier, since B can then extend on either side. E4 gives W an opportunity to make a pincer which works well with the right side. See the variation for a possible continuation.]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[iq];B[co];W[bo];B[bn]C[z: This was a misplaced stone. I was fortunate W did not punish more severely.

r: W cannot play C6 (see variation) so your move is not that bad.]

(;W[bp];B[do];W[cm];B[cn];W[bm];B[an]C[r: A6 is not very good since it does not threaten the life of the W group (see variation).]

(;W[br];B[el];W[dl];B[em];W[ek]
(;B[kp]C[r: B should play the forcing move at F9. Also, B should not think only about reducing white's territory. A B move at K17 would be quite big (see variation).]
;W[io];B[kn];W[im]C[r: B ends up with separated groups and the left group starts to be under some pressure.]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[hn];W[in];B[hm];W[ho];B[go]C[r: B has strengthened the middle W group and is not yet completely alive. This shows that L4 was not very good.]
;W[hq];B[oo];W[op];B[mo];W[no];B[nn];W[np];B[mn];W[lp];B[kq]
C[z: Greedy.

r: Yes. Don't think only about erasing your opponent't territory. You could play the forcing move at F9 then K17, for example.]
;W[lo];B[ko];W[ln];B[lm]C[r: Too greedy again. B has to play L7 to save his group, but this will damage the right side. This confirms that L3 was a bad move.]
;W[km];B[jm];W[kl];B[jl];W[jn];B[ll];W[kk];B[il];W[lk];B[nl]
;W[hl];B[jj];W[gl]C[r: B has weaknesses everywhere and cannot save all his groups at this point.]
;B[fm];W[jk];B[ik]C[r: Don't try to escape from a ladder. Play instead G7 to save the B group and to break the ladder at the same time.]
;W[ij];B[hk]C[r: Same remark: W H10 creates a ladder. Play G7 instead, which ensures life and is a ladder breaker.]
;W[gk]C[r: W is very kind... But B is still in trouble despite this white mistake.]
;B[hj];W[ii];B[gj];W[fj];B[hh];W[ki];B[ih];W[jh];B[hi]C[r: Do not play such ataris just because they are possible. Keep them as potential ko threats for later. W cannot cut at H11 anyway (B G11 would be atari against W).]
;W[ji];B[dm];W[ck]C[z: Okay, so B's LL is alive, but W is destroying B's moyo, and B still has many weaknesses.  At this point in game, I estimated myself to be far behind.

r: the game is not lost yet, because the L3 group has some aji left.]
;B[gm];W[fk]
(;B[cf]C[r: Why can try something at the bottom instead (see variation). At the top, H16 or J16 would help the center B group and work well with D17 and P16. B should not give yet another target (the center group) to W.]
;W[eg];B[jd]C[r: This would be better at H16 or J16 to defend the B center group.]
;W[if]C[r: Now B is once again under pressure. Even if B saves his center group, W will build strength which will damage the other B territories.]
;B[ig]C[r: The empty triangle is very bad shape, which reduces B's liberties. You will see later that this shortage of liberties will have a crucial effect on the game. Just play H14 directly.]
;W[jg];B[hf];W[ie];B[he];W[id];B[hd];W[ic];B[ee];W[kf]C[r: Now you can see that R16 has become a wasted move, and would have been more helpful at H16 or J16.]
;B[lc]C[Q13 would be bigger than M17.];W[fb]C[r: W could have invaded the right side instead.]
;B[fc];W[gb]C[r: W could have treated F18 as forcing move and switched to an invasion of the right side instead.]
;B[pg]C[z: Now I feel like I have a decent bit of territory again.

r: the B moyo is still a bit thin.];W[pm]C[r: Q7 is a good move, difficult to answer because B has many weaknesses.]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[ql];W[rm];B[rl];W[om];B[nm]C[z: Greedy mistake.

r: B should play P8 instead. M7 and M8 are too small to take in gote for W.]
;W[ol];B[ok];W[nk];B[mk]C[r: B should now try the aji at the bottom (M2) instead of giving more prisonners to W.]
;W[nj];B[mj];W[ni];B[mi];W[nh];B[mh];W[mg];B[ng]C[z: Basically, I miscalculated liberties.

r: Indeed...];W[ml];B[oh];W[on];B[bi]C[z: My intent w/ this move was to threaten to capture W, in order to reduce W and expand B.

r: It is indeed a good idea to take profit in sente.];W[bj]
C[r: W could play B9 instead to ensure life.];B[ci];W[cj];B[dh]

(;W[eh]C[r: W should simply play E11: B cannot cut (see variation).]
;B[ei];W[dj];B[fi];W[ch];B[bh]C[r: Good.];W[dg];B[bg]
(;W[ej]C[r: W mistake. W should play B8 instead to ensure an easy life (see variation).]
;B[bl]C[z: I now saw that I -might- be able to capture.

r: W is is serious trouble now but can save the group because of B's shortage of liberties.]
;W[al];B[ak];W[cl];B[am];W[gg]
(;B[hg]C[z: Could I have captured?  I don't think so.

r: you have to connect here and W can indeed live because of B's shortage of liberties. Remember the previous comment about the bad empty triangle at J13. See variations.]

(;W[nf]C[r: W should live instead (see variation).]
(;B[og]C[z: HUGE MISTAKE.  Couldn't B have ignored and killed W's L group?

r: Right, B should ignore.];W[md];B[mf]C[z: Overplay.

r: and killing the left W group is more urgent anyway.];W[lg]
C[r: Just as for the aji of L3 at the bottom, both players will ignore the enormous aji on the left side for a long time.]
;B[mc];W[me];B[ne];W[of];B[pf];W[lf];B[nd];W[kd];B[kc];W[jc]
;B[ld];W[ke];B[eb]C[z: I was happy to get this stone.

r: but killing the W group was bigger.];W[gc]
(;B[fd]C[r: This was the last of 10 consecutive move where B lost the opportunity to kill W. F15 instead of F16 would kill (see variation).]
;W[ff]C[r: Now W is alive.];B[fe];W[gh];B[gi];W[fh];B[cg];W[dh]
;B[hc];W[hb];B[fr];W[er]
(;B[is]C[r: by going to a peaceful endgame with J1, B is likely to lose since W is ahead. B might as well try saving the L3 group with M2 and K2. Only a very strong player can determine in advance the outcome of the semeai, but a weaker player can try anyway if it's the only way to win.]
;W[jr];B[js];W[kr];B[ks];W[lr]
(;B[gs]C[r: B can push once more in sente (see variation).]
;W[ls];B[aj]C[r: A10 is still small at this point mainly because it is gote. T7 double sente is bigger.]
;W[la]C[r: overplay.]
(;B[lb]C[r: B should play L18 (see variation).];W[ka];B[ma]
;W[ja];B[jb];W[ib];B[ia];W[ha];B[kb];W[ia];B[nb];W[bk];B[al]

;W[ga];B[ea];W[le];C[z: Please give an everview of your feelings-- what was done well, and what needs significant improvement.

z: Also, I send a big "THANK YOU" to the reviewer.  Your time is greatly appreciated.

r: I think that the main thing to improve is to avoid creating several weak groups. B has been under pressure for a large part of the game, mainly because of L4 and L3. While under pressure, B makes no points while W builds strength.

The attack on the left W group starting with B11 was a very good idea. It could have succeeded ten times and failed in the end only because B had weaknesses in his center group.]
