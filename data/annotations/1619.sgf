Review by Erik Ekholm, Swedish 3 dan,
August 2001.];B[pd];W[cq];B[oq];W[ed];B[qp];W[jp]LB[qj:a]C[EE: The right side is bigger, because both
black corners want to develop to 'a'. The bottom
on the other hand is the smallest side since
both black and white have low solid formations
facing it. So 'a' is a bigger move.];B[cd];W[ce];B[dd];W[de]
;B[ec];W[fc]C[EE: Very good! Black lacks liberties.];B[fd];W[ee]
;B[gc];W[dc];B[fb];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[dn];W[cl]LB[fp:a]C[EE: 'a' is a simpler way to play - connect your
position.];B[eq]
(;LB[dp:a][ep:b][eo:c]C[EE: This is thin, so you should be thinking of exploiting that by cutting (either a-b-c or the variation given). It will be complicated;
that's why I recommended a simpler move
than c8.];W[dq]LB[ep:a]C[EE: Bad!  If Black plays 'a', his stones work together again and you lose out on the exchange.]
;B[hp];W[ep]C[EE: Good.];B[fq];W[fp];B[gq];W[ho]C[EE: A very sharp move. Read carefully before playing such moves!]

;B[jo];W[fm];B[gf];W[fg];B[jn];W[qg]LB[qi:A][qf:B][qj:a][qk:b]
C[Piotr: I think it is not good move. The A or B will be better.

EE: 'B' is of better use if you want to invade 3-3
later. Here, 'A', 'c' or 'd' are better, since white threatens to make the moyo below bigger.]

C[EE: Big success for white.];B[fj];W[ph];B[og];W[rd]LB[qi:a]
TR[od]C[Too passive! Better play 'a'. Black has nothing
here and you may be able to attack the marked group.];B[qh]
;W[rf];B[pi];W[lm];B[jl];W[lk];B[mi];W[jm]LB[kj:a]C[EE: Doesn't work. Better to run out with 'a'.]

;B[hj];W[dm]LB[nm:a]C[EE: This is not urgent. Better reduce him at
'a' or deeper if you dare.];B[en];W[cn];B[fo]C[EE: This is a cut, so now you must have a plan for how your centre group will live.]
;W[do];B[ml];W[mm];B[nl];W[nm];B[pm]TR[jl]C[EE: The marked stone plays a vital role for white's eye shape. See variation!]

C[EE: The white group is beginning to look very unhealthy.]
;W[fn]C[Piotr: It was gote

EE: It doesn't make an eye. It doesn't have to be gote if you give up the three stones which are smaller than your centre group.]
;B[eo];W[dp];B[no]C[EE: Black plays a little slackly here, so white gets another chance.]

is Black's move now so it is very close.];B[jd];W[kd];B[rg]

C[EE: Threatening to cut two living groups is not a big threat. 'a' and 'b' are good threats.]
;B[ea];W[ge]LB[ba:a][rh:b]C[EE: This is very very small. 'a' (almost 6 points reverse sente) and 'b' (6 points gote) are bigger.]

[sg:b][sh:c]C[EE: 'a' is better, but first you can exchange 'b' for 'c' in sente. Even if you lose the ko at 'b'
you haven't lost anything there.];W[ad];B[sg];W[ga];B[fa];W[ab]

(;W[jk];B[il];W[ik];B[hl];W[hk]C[EE: If you win this ko, you are just about alive,
