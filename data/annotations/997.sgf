C[I am not convinced that I am strong enough to review this game properly, since you are 4k* IGS and I am 1 dan British Go Association, and those grades are fairly equal, but I will have a go. I hope, at least, that I will be able to give you a different perspective.

This game quite rapidly turns into a territory (white) vs influence (black) game. I think that black builds up quite a substantial lead, and then tries very hard to give the game away in the endgame.

The other unusual feature of the game is the two less-than-joseki sequences played in the opening.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[oq];W[dd];B[fq]C[This is good, it is consistent with the 5-3 stone which places emphasis on the lower edge.]
;W[dn];B[jp]
(;W[qq]C[This seems to me to be exactly what black wanted.

My personal experience is that people who play the 5-3 and 4-5 points often do it because they know lots of difficult joseki and are trying to lure their opponents into approaching so that they can start some messy fight. Why fall in with their plans? Why not get on with your own game instead. See the variation for another suggestion.]
;B[qn]C[This is quite an aggressive move, but since this is Black's sphere of influence black is entitled to start a fight if he wishes. I have no idea what is joseki after this.]
;W[op]C[This is either leaning on black's stronger stone (good), of it is strengthening black's rather thin 4-space extension of the lower side (bad). I fear you are doing the second of these here.

If you can manage to just move out into the centre without leaning on black too hard, then eventually black will need to play defensive moves on both sides, The knight's move/shoulder hit at Q5 might achieve that. But this move looks possible.]

(;B[pq]C[I am not impressed by this move. It is rather crude.]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[qo];B[rp]C[So far, so good, but before you give up that white stone, make sure that you get full value from it.]

(;W[ro];B[rq]
(;W[pn]C[You aren't making the most of this position, see variation.]
;B[np];W[qm]C[This is far too timid. You should answer black's hane with one of your own at O5.]

;B[ed];W[ce];B[dc];W[cd]C[Good.];B[df]
(;W[ec]C[This is too easy on black. Black plays atari and gets excellent shape.

First note that you are already alive in the corner (first variation). So you are quite at liberty to tenuki.

However it is very tempting to go to work on black's cutting points (second variation).]

;B[ng]C[Good.]
(;W[gb]C[This is just an endgame move. It has no effect on the life/death status of any group.

Of course it is a very big endgame move so it is possible to play it now, if you don't play it now will black really spend a whole move defending his territory? If not it will still be there later. As it is you are just going to make black thicker. This will hurt your stone at K15.

In terms of endgame moves, the jump out to H18 is much more destructive.]

(;B[ni]C[Black takes sente, good.

But this move is very kind on white.];W[pi]
(;B[fi]C[This is also very passive.]
(;W[dk]C[This does not feel like a terribly valuable move to me. White's territory on the edge is open to sliding moves.

It looks to me as if the game is going to be decided by how much territory black makes in the centre. How much does black need there? let's count.

White top: 25
White on the right: 20
White on the left: hard to say, since it is a bit lose and open skirted. I would say 15.

So that is 60 for white.

Black top right corner: 10
Black bottom right corner: 15
then there is the rest of the black position across the bottom which is not territory yet, but it must be worth at least another 10.
So black seems to need about 25 points from his central moyo, and he seems to have that already. I favour black.]

Notice that there is some interesting aji near the bottom right corner.]
