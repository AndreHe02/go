C[I'm still pretty new to this game.
I read some tips/info on different aspects of the game, but all of em go too deep and I can't play in the game what I learnt. That's why I ordered some books but it will be a month and a half from now until I get them. So for now I'm doing what I can.

Even though in alot of my moves I didn't really plan anything special, I'd like to know what moves of mine were really useless, and which were good so I'd know to repeat them.
Also, I'd like to know why I couldn't stop his invasion to my left side, cause if I stopped it early enough I think I could win the game, or at least be a alot closer to it.

I appreciate your work! Thank you very much!];B[dk]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Following are a few comments reviewing the black side.];W[jj]
;B[dc]TR[dd][cd]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Ok opening so far.  I have seen quite a few strong players are reluctant to play symmetrical.  (Even if I'm not completely sure why...)  A more "usual" placement of three would be C10 or D10.
Even so D11 is joseki, and black has sente, so there's nothing wrong with it.]
;W[jc]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
White does not play symmetrical.  And in a way K11 "meets" black D11.]
;B[gc]TR[jg][cg]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
G11 is very very strong.  But wrong.  It is way too small and thick, especially this early in the game.  C7 or K7 would have been much bigger and therefore better.  Note that if you play K7 here (which is a very offensive move) you have to prepare for white playing C7 or D7 as response.
Personally I would have gone for C7 here.  In part it (almost) gives you an entire side of the board, and in part it will give you an early signal about white's playing style and goals.  With the gote move of 5 at C7, would white play offensive or defensive? And where? And not the least if white plays defensively black might get to play 7 at K7 next.  (7 at H3 also looks good!)]
;W[hk]TR[je][jg][gg][cg]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
White plays it carefully and safe.  And demonstrates that G11 was nothing to lose sleep over...
C7 would still almost secure the entire left for black.
G7 (tengen) would create a very large but lose framework, staking out more than half the board.  This could lead to a merciless fight quite fast.
K7 or K9 would split white's two corners.  After one of these moves you would probably be attacked and should run towards the centre afterwards to keep safe.  (Running with one-point jumps like K7 to H7.)]
;B[cg]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
And there we are!  Very good!];W[jg]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Another solid and conservative move from white.  Now black has several concerns...  
- So far white has a slightly bigger mojo.
- It's good for black to keep sente.
- A white invation is unwanted.];B[gk]TR[gg][ke]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]

No!

A go proverb says "Attack from a distance, defend with contact moves."  H3 was not an attack so black is not defending.
Another proverb says "If someone slaps you in the face, slap them right back:"  G3 is terrible.  It is weak as it stands, it is easy for white to counter, and it does not advance the black position.
I think G7 and L9 are far better alternatives.  White could not afford to ignore either, but especially L9.]
;W[hb]TR[gj]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
I am unsure about this white move.  The expected response is G4, and that would have meant immediate and big trouble for black. A move on the second line this early is a surprise.  Perhaps it's a mistake...?]
;B[gb]TR[hj][hc]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Late in the game with very little territory left G12 would have been a sensible response.  A better response here is H11.  The second line is called "the line of death", and we can happily let white get the small territory there while building influence towards the centre on line three.
A stylish reply would be to ignore H12 and play H4 instead.  Then there would still be time to play H11 later.
(And I think L9 still looks good...)];W[hc]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
This looks even and fair.  But really it isn't.  In fact this short exchange has been far better for white than for black.]
;B[hd]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Good!  Hane is a terrific follow-up.];W[id]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
White more or less "had to" play J10.];B[gd]TR[he]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
What?  Please don't turn insane all of a sudden...  G10 is thick, over-protective, gote and totally redundant.  Black 15 should have been on H9!
There is no risk of white cutting at G10; that would be a ladder ending in death for white at D7.]
;W[hi]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Strong move by white.  Now black H4 doesn't make sense anymore.]
;B[gi]TR[ie]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
G5 is ok.  But I would also consider J9.];W[gl];B[fl]TR[fk]
C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
A safer response would be F3.  Imagine if white plays F3 next...]
;W[hm];B[fm]TR[ie][gj]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
F1 is a wasted move.  Moves on the second line and especially the first wait until the endgame.  I would have played G4, but J9 looks very good as well.]
;W[gm];B[fk]TR[gj]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Nooooo!  What ARE you doing?  This is exactly the same overprotective gote play as G10 was.  But this time the impact is even bigger.

PLEASE study stone 15 and 23.  Meditate on them.  Chant "It's too thick.  It's gote.  It's too thick.  It's gote.  It's too thick.  It's gote.  Etc..."  And never play like that again! :-)

In this situation G4 is the only move.  Just imagine if white lets you play H4 later!  It could lead to a big kill.]
;W[hj];B[gj]TR[gh]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Whoa!  Easy now.  Even if G4 looks sensible at first I don't think it's the best play.  Consider playing stone 25 at G6.  White pushing through at G4 is no threat at all; F4 stops him.]
;W[gg]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Tengen is an interesting move by white.  It cannot be cut off because of K7.

(
Black G6 - White H6
Black H7 - White H8 atari
Black J7 - White J8 atari and black is caught...
)];B[ie]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Good!  Very well spotted.  Be aware that white can cut this stone off if he wants to.  But it might bring him trouble later.]
;W[je];B[if]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Brilliant.  J8 works in several ways.  It peeks at K8 while preparing to cut G7 away from the rest of the white stones.
This could easilly be the start of a sequence winning the game for black.  This is a crucial point.]
;W[ig]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
A strong follow-up by white...];B[he]TR[jf]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Yet another overprotective connection.  I would rather fight back with K8.]
;W[jf];B[hg]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
H6 is good.];W[hh];B[hf]TR[gh]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
H8 is not so good.  This lets white through.  Play G6 and let H7 become a ko by answering G8 if white captures.  If white then simply connects at H8 instead of fighting the ko, F7 will stop the snake, and black is set to win.]
;W[gh];B[fh]TR[eg][ef]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
I actually think E7 or E8 might work better for stopping the white snake.  -And black has to pull back a bit to be able to stop it.]
;W[fg];B[eg];W[ff];B[ee]TR[ef]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
E8 is better.];W[fe];B[fd]TR[ef]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
I still recommend E8...];W[ef]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
White is having a field day; a walk in the park.....];B[eh]
TR[dg]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Yet again too thick.  Black would probably end up better by playing D7 here.  This is yet another overprotective connection.]
;W[df];B[ce]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Too many single and weak stones.  It is hard to spot a really good move.  Stopping snakes like this is hard and usually demands that you pull a bit back and sacrifice some territory.
For each stone white plays the snake gains two or three liberties. Each black stone only takes away one liberty.  As a rule snakes cannot be stopped with contact moves alone.]
;W[de];B[ed]TR[cf][dd]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
I think E10 is wrong.  I would sacrifice E9 and play D10 or C8 at this point.]
;W[cf];B[ha]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Valiant try.  I would probably keep on protecting against the snake.  Unless you end this new exchange in sente white gets to make two "snake-moves" in a row.]
;W[ia];B[ga];W[jb];B[im]TR[kk][be]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
J1 is not really a viable attack.  But it would work great as a ko-threat.  Better to play either B9 (to stop the snake) or L3 (to make a real attempt at an invation).]
;W[hl];B[il];W[jk];B[jl]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
This cannot work.];W[kl];B[kk];W[ik];B[ll];W[jm];B[lk]TR[kj]
C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
If the black invation should stand more than a snowball's chance 65 should be played at L4.  -Even so chances are slim...]
;W[lj];B[kj];W[li];B[ki];W[kh];B[lh];W[lg];B[mh];W[mg];B[lm]
;W[ji];B[km];W[jl];B[bf]TR[be]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Finally a sensible move.  But weak.  B9 would have made a better defence....]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[dh];B[di];W[be];B[cd];W[bg]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
...as white realises.];B[bd];W[af];B[ad]TR[bh]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Another not-so-strong move on the first line.  B6 is better.]
;W[bf]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Lucky you.  White have no need to make this connection.];B[bh]
;W[ah];B[bi]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Good!];W[ai];B[aj];W[ag];B[bj]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
Finally the snake is stopped.  The last three stones were correctly played.]
;W[dd];B[lf]TR[cc]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
M8 really does nothing.  Imagine the disaster white can create by ignoring it and playing C11.  99 should be played there.]
;W[le];B[me];W[mi];B[ke];W[ld];B[kd];W[lc];B[mc]C[[ Bjørn Ingmar Berg \]
...and here black resigned.  White is well ahead and black has no real way to catch up, so that's an ok ending.

Had black played move numbers 25 and 35 differently the game would have been very even, and it's concievable that black could have won.]
