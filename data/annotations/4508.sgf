C[Riken: Hi, my name is Wouter, I played black in this game. I hope you can show me which moves were played poorly, and what should have been played instead. In addition I have added some questions. Thank you very much in advance.

JM: Riken, thanks for the opportunity to review your game!  It was quite the interesting battle.  Black adopted a strategy which I normally do not, but it proved fairly effective.  I felt, however, that a few moves around move 80 decided the game, when black chose to stake a claim to the center.  When this plan failed, it became a losing battle.

I am a 1k* on iGS, so please take all of my comments with a grain of salt.  Remember that only the professionals can say with any certainty what the best move in a position is.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[qf];B[nc];W[dp];B[dn]C[JM: The high approach here seems a bit odd.  White generally ends up with a larger than normal corner as a result.]
;W[fp];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[bq];B[cj];W[ed];B[ee]C[Riken: Is this a good joseki to start here?

JM: It's certainly interesting, if slightly unorthodox.  I can't find anything obviously wrong with it.]
;W[dd];B[de];W[cc];B[be];W[bd];B[ce];W[fd]C[JM: Notice, however, that white now has two corners that are building on the 4th line, the 'line of victory'.]

(;B[hc]C[JM: This move ended up having a very large impact on the rest of the game.  It's a bit too close to the white strength in my opinion.  I'd recommend pressuring R14 instead.  See variation.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[gf];B[fg]C[Riken: I was thinking about g13, but chose to play f13, because I thought g13 might weaken h17 too much.

JM: Probably true.  h17 might have been a bit too close in the first place though.]
;W[jc];B[he];W[ge];B[jd];W[kd];B[je];W[ic];B[hd];W[ld];B[lb]
C[Riken: is this a good move? Destroying a base and makng one for myself seemed proper to me here.

JM: It's the h17 stones that need a base more urgently.  Now you remove the aji at L16, which hurts their prospects a bit.  Still, it's sente and keeps the white stones weak.  As long as you can run quickly into the center, it's not bad.]
;W[mb];B[mc];W[kb];B[lc];W[kc];B[ne]C[Riken: Is this move ok? And what about m14?

JM: M14 is a brave fighting move, because it is open to the cut.  In my opinion, O15 should be played if you are confident you can play something around R12 before white.  O15 forces white to pressure your H17 stones more.]
;W[lf];B[ig];W[gg];B[fh];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[kh]C[Riken: I was in doubt here about either playing in the top left like f18 or c18, and L12. Is L12 a good call?

JM: L12 looks rather vague to me.  F18 seems too small.  The two moves I might consider are G12 and M12.  M12 is clearly the point white would like next, and G12 threatens to seal white in and link up the H17 stones.  Also, if you get G12 *then* F18 can be more severe.]
;W[fb];B[mg];W[lg];B[lh];W[mf];B[nf];W[mh];B[ng];W[hb];B[ke]
;W[md];B[rb]C[Riken: With hindsight, I think I should have played this one at q12 or r12 instead. Good idea?

JM: Yes, Q12/R12 is a better idea, allowing you to later approach Q4 with strength.]

;W[mk];B[gh];W[if];B[jf];W[ql];B[oh];W[rj];B[om]C[JM: Black is letting white have a significant amount of points along the sides.  He must be confident he can dominate the center or else he will lose.]
;W[hh];B[hg];W[ih];B[jh];W[hf];B[jg];W[jj];B[ii];W[hk];B[lj]
C[Riken: Now I notice n7 instead of m10. Any good?

JM: N7 is good point to take, but then You are almost required to kill the center white stones.  Even then, white may make enough on the bottom to win.]
;W[mj];B[kj];W[ll];B[np]C[JM: Why always approach high?];W[fk]
;B[gj];W[gk];B[ej];W[fj];B[hq]C[Riken: I thought f10 was slow, and playing at the bottom was much more needed. If white had played h3 or m3 instead of f10, black would have a big problem. So I must have done something very wrong in the beginning to end up in this mess.

JM: Parts of this can be traced back to the close approach of H17.  Also, the plays of Q9/P7 gave white a lot of strength.

Again, I think you're approaching too close to white.  H3 is almost certainly going to be responded to with K3.  Playing J3 would make things tougher for white, or K3 would work well with O4.]
;W[jq];B[ho];W[jl]C[Riken: Only now I see why white played k8. Should I have played L8 sooner?

JM: Yep.  Try to keep the white groups separated is always a good idea.]

(;B[fn]C[Riken: this move didn't seem to save the h3 and h5 stones. Is there still a way? If not, what should I have done differently?

JM: I put it one, slightly optimistic variation.];W[go];B[jr]

C[JM: Ignoring what happens next, take a look at how your initial strategy worked out.  Black gets ~35 points on the side.  White gets ~12+28=~40.  While these are about the same, it's important to note that white's territory has always been secure, while yours has constantly been pressured.  This led to the collapse of the middle and few points for black anywhere else.]

;B[ck];W[eo]C[Riken: I resigned here.

JM: Bad shape strikes again. :-(

This game was still up for grabs until you lost H2/H4.  At that point, white probably had enough points to win.  I'd suggest making a conscious effort in a few of your next games to concentrate on what territory you are claiming (the left side and the center), at what territory your opponent gets to claim as a result (the top, the right).  Don't be too greedy to take that away (H17), but simply contain it.]
