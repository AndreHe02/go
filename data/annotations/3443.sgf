AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.  My comments are preceded by my name.

I don't think you played that badly, but I pointed out a few simple mistakes you made (such as the double atari at H10, or throwing away a group in the top center), as well as a bad shape you made on move 4 that you repeated a number of times.]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[qm];B[rm]C[Ted: This is very bad shape for Black, and one that you made a few more times during the game.  I really think you should have played at R5 instead.]
;W[rn];B[qo];W[rl];B[nn];W[ro];B[rp];W[ql];B[pm];W[qi];B[qh]
C[Ted: There's an adage about attaching moves like this being defensive.  I think this would be better at R13 instead of R12.]
;W[rh];B[rg]C[Ted: A repeat of the bad shape you made when you played Black 4.]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[qg];B[qf];W[qh];B[re];W[sg];B[rf];W[og];B[of]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[jd]C[I was wondering what do you think is the best response to this move?

Ted: I think your best response is to approach from the side.  There's a Go proverb saying something to the effect that you should attack from the direction in which you're weaker, the point being that while you attack your opponent, you can shore up a weaker group of your own.  In this case, that would mean playing something like G16.]
;B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[gd];B[dg];W[jp]C[I was wondering what do you think is the best response to this move?

Ted: In this case, I think you ought to reinforce your group in the bottom right.  So, you should probably approach with a move like M3 or M4.]
;B[jn];W[fp];B[dm];W[eq];B[dq];W[nq];B[mp]C[Should i have played around p3 instead?

Ted: In handicap games, one of White's objectives is to get Black to play smaller (and unnecessary) reinforcing moves that allow White to get more territory on the other side.  So, I think you're OK with N4.]
;W[mq];B[lq];W[lr];B[kp];W[kq];B[lp];W[jq];B[hp]C[Ted: I like this move in that it tries to limit what White can get on the bottom.]

;W[ef];B[de];W[gf];B[fg];W[cj]C[I was wondering what do you think is the best response to this move?

Ted: This invasion is different from the two on the top and bottom (at K16 and K4 earlier in the game) in that White has played on the third line instead of the fourth.  Trying to restrict White to a small amount of territory on the side looks to be a better idea here than after K16 or K4.]
;B[dj]C[Ted: There's an adage that contact moves like this are defensive -- if you want to confine White to the side, a move one row closer to the center (E10) might be better.]
;W[di];B[ei]C[Ted: Where have we seen this bad shape before?  :-)]

;W[gl]C[Ted: I'm amazed White didn't punish you by playing the double atari.]

;B[on];W[oh];B[ni];W[oi];B[nj];W[pj];B[mk];W[od];B[pf]C[Ted: This is a mistake.  You should have taken care of the two stones at P17 and P18, by playing something like Q17.  You don't have to worry about White playing an atari at Q15, or capturing the Q13 stone.

Note also that White has an attack at Q18.];W[np];B[no];W[op]

;B[an]C[Ted: You could have played A7 here and reduced White by a few points, while keeping sente.]
;W[cl];B[ir]C[Ted: I'm not certain this attack is a good idea.  I would probably shore up the weakess at K13.  This doesn't lose sente, as once you've filled that hole, you can play J16.]
