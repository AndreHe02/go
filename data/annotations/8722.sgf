AB[pd][dp]C[A game from KGS where I played white. Throughout the game a certain number of situations arose where I have the feeling my play was not optimal, but cannot see what the best outcome could have been. I hope to get some insight about those and get a feedback on my play.

Hello Piou. My name is Greg Cole (gillessed on KGS). I will preface all my comments with GC. If I did not answer any of you questions, feel free to email me afterwards.]

;W[op];B[nr];W[mo];B[dj]C[Until here everything seems joseki to me

GC: Looks good to me. I might have considered K17 as well, because that makes good shape with the upper right corner. And will make it easier to reduce white's moyo on the right. However, I think this is also fine.]
;W[jc]
(;B[lc]C[Here I considered pushing the white stone towards the san-rei-sen where I asumed I had most strength.

GC: The issue is this push isn't actually aggresive enough and white makes off better here because he can get settled and your corner is overconcentrated but no actually secure. R17 is still wide open.]

(;B[hc];W[fe];B[df];W[id]C[I am pretty sure I saw this pattern in a pro game before, but I cannot remember what the black follow-up is and had much diificulty planning a strategy from here on.

GC: This is fine. Black usually has 2 choices here. See variations.]
(;B[gd]C[GC: Running out like this creates a weak group for white to attack and is not very good for black.]
;W[dc]C[GC: I think you should just Play C17.]

(;B[sg]C[GC: It's still too early for the monkey jump. It just makes white stronger so as to attack the O10 stones. You need to reduce the area on a larger scale and make sure the O10 stones are safe. If that bottom is reduced, you are still ahead on points. However, if white gets a lot of it, he will win.]
