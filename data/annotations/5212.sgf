C[Patrick: I took white here and lost by 26.5 with a 6.5 komi. My problem is that I allowed black to get too much thickness on the lower side.]

vincent> if you really do not want black gain "infleunce", you should no t play move like this placement on san-san, this play yes you will gain territory yet in the expense of giving "influence"...

for me may play few move:

o16 to build up a base; c14 to see how black react; r6 or even k3/4.]

It's possible that if I had a better sense of positional judgement, I might have defended at the right time and eeked out a win. I think I lost about 30 points in the endgame phase.

vincent> overall, i believe if patrick you can build up initial opening fuseki and opening feeling well, the play will be easier, atleast during middle game you have better move selection open due to better opening...

shuko has a series of books talk about "next move" is quit a good book to learn from if you want. Else book like Otake hideo on "fuseki dictionary" 2 volume is good reference.

Hope suggestion helpful for you lim.kimkeong@gmail.com])
