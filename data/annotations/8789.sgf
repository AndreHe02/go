C[Ololoev [18k\]: hi gl


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, my name is Dan, Raidhyn on KGS and last I played seriously I was ranked 5Kyu.

This is my first review for Go Teaching Ladder and I hope it is helpful to you!]
;B[pp]C[kitsune01 [17k\]: hi enjoy];W[cp];B[oc];W[dd];B[qd]
;W[eq]C[Although this opening looks normal at this point, it was very unusal. Both players have a weak understanding of joseki, but at this level of play that's ok.]
;B[fd]
(;W[ec]C[This is a really soft move and doesn't really fall under any kind of joseki. The result ends up giving black a very comfortable position on the top of the board. See the variations at 7 for some more normal options. 

Regardless, the result for white wasn't bad and the sequence was played out well.]
(;B[ed];W[de];B[fc]
(;W[dc]C[White here is solid which is nice.];B[jc];W[np]TR[cj]
[dj]C[Here I think white made a good choice of where to approach. Playing at either of the traingled moves would have kept white too constrained with all of his stones on one side of the board.]
;B[oq]C[This is what tends to in Kyu games where players are unfamiliar with joseki. Mirroring white's moves feel safe so the exchange here begins the same as it did in the top left. 

White's next move plays for influence instead of territory, see the variation to see what would have happened had the exchanged mirrored the top left.]
(;W[oo];B[po]C[Letting black crawl on the fourth line here is painful. His corner is becoming huge while white doesn't have much to show for it.]
;W[on];B[pn];W[nq]
(;B[nr];W[mr]C[Black can atually chose to ignore this and play elsewhere as there are a number of large point left on the board. 

Most second line moves are considered very small, usually only worth a few points. Let's look at what happens if black plays a big move somewhere else.]
(;B[os]C[P2 is better for black as it's more solid and doesn't leave behind as many threats.]
;W[jq]C[Good extension from white.];B[qj]C[This is the natural play from black and is a smart move.]
;W[ck]TR[cj][dj][dk]C[This move could have also been played at any of the Triangled locations. Here it just doesn't feel balanced as the Shimari at the bottom doesn't need such close support and the thick formation at the top doesn't feel in trouble either. In this situation the most important thing is that white  played in the largest area of the board for the biggest move and that  is what's important. 

***
This is a normal stage of low kyu games where it seems like all of the big points on the board on the corners and sides have been taken. This is usually where the game breaks out into chaos and it's anyone's fight.]
;B[dg]TR[ff][cg][ch][dh][dj][jn][eo]C[Instead of this move black has a number of options although this is the weakest part of white's left side now. 

See the variations for other responses.]
(;W[ef]C[Splitting black here says that white is ready to fight. And a fight breaks out, see the varations at the last move for other responses. 

The variations below are on blacks reponse to the cut.]
(;B[eg];W[cg]C[This move leaves a lot of cutting points for black to play with.]
;B[ch]
(;W[dh]C[This cut is overly agressive, although white does have the ladder it could have led to some other problems. Better here to play solidly at C14.]
(;B[di];W[eh];B[cf];W[bg];B[fg];W[df];B[ei];W[fh];B[cj];W[gh]
;B[dk];W[gf]C[Solid net here. Very nice.];B[cl];W[bk]
(;B[dm]C[This is the wrong move by black as he could have secured the left without worry and would have led to an entirely different middle game.]
(;W[bh]TR[bj]C[Black can just sacrifice this stone and secure his group by playing at B10.]
(;B[ci];W[cn]C[This is a good play by white since it undermines black's chances to take the side.]
;B[eo]C[Good move by black.];W[dn];B[en];W[bl];B[dp];W[cm];B[dl]
;W[dq];B[gp];W[ep];B[do];W[ip];B[co]
(;W[bo];B[bp];W[cq];B[bn];W[bm];B[ao];W[bq];B[aq];W[ar];B[ap]
(;W[br];B[fp];W[am];B[fr];W[fq];B[gq];W[hr];B[gr];W[er];B[bs]
(;W[cs];B[ds];W[es];B[cr];W[fs];B[gs]C[At this point white's group is "almost dead." See the variation.]
(;W[hs]
(;B[fn]
(;W[ho]C[This move doesn't really do a whole lot. J6 would be better.]
;B[je];W[jh];B[mf];W[kf];B[ke]
(;W[ie]TR[if][jf]C[This is the second time white has played this kind of move where white plays against the head of two stones. This is rarely good and again leads to some weaknessess for black to exploit without fear for his own strong group.]
;B[hd];W[id];B[ic];W[lf];B[le];W[jf];B[gc]TR[mh][mj][gk][gl]
[om]C[This is a wasted move as it doesn't accomplish much. Black should want to either fix his group on the left which is still unsettled, or play at the trianged points on the right.]
;W[mg];B[nf];W[fi];B[gk];W[an];B[bo];W[fk];B[fj]C[This is one of those rare instance where the one space jump can be cut.]
;W[fl]
(;B[em]C[Black shouldn't be worried about the cut here and more about taking out white's weak invastion.]
;W[gj]
(;B[gm];W[gl];B[hk];W[hl];B[ik];W[il];B[jk];W[om];B[pm];W[pl]
C[I think this was about the point where white won the game. Although the life or death of the bottom left corner still had a huge part to play, black lost out on his oppourtunity to settle his group on the outside before white took all of his liberties as the game progressed.]
;B[ql];W[pk];B[qk];W[pj];B[ph];W[oi];B[og];W[pi];B[qi];W[oh]
;B[qg]C[Playing solidly at q13 is better for black.];W[ng];B[pf]
C[Now black has to spend a move protecting and wastes a point.]
;W[kk]C[Here it is again =) There's no need to make contact  if white is trying to stop blacks out ward progression.

"When you make contact with a stone you make it stronger." Is a proverb you should think about. It also forces a response.]
;B[hj];W[gi];B[jl];W[jm];B[kl];W[ej];B[kj];W[dj];B[lk];W[bi]
C[Blacks group is already dead no matter what he does before this, this is a wasted move for white.]

any tips or things like that will be helpfull thank you

-----------

For now my  advice to you would be to watch for creating weaknesses while attacking. Making contact plays at the head of a thick group of black stones was a mistake you made more than once. Remember to play solidly. 

I would also reccomend looking over some joseki at http://eidogo.com/ . Just learning one of the basic varations for corner plays will help you avoid playing soft moves in the opening and letting black get too much too easy.

Although white won the game, the outcome would have been very different if the group of white stones in the bottom left had died as originally intended. 

The best advice I can give anyone is to keep playing! You will only get stronger the more you play and the more you take the time to look at your mistakes (and your opponents) and learn from them.

I hope this has been helpful to you. Cheers.
