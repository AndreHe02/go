C[xxc : hi

review made for Rourensu

after a short read, this game is a "moyo" game
then i'll do the comment in this way
i can't explain each "suggested moves", but i'm sure you can find a lot of material on the web, i point out the doors ... studdy and play it :)

1, 2, 3 ... are my choice by order];B[pp]C[floss [6k\]: no, i mean review
floss [6k\]: existing game
RyuuzakiL [16k\]: Onegaishimasu];W[dd];B[dp]C[RyuuzakiL [16k\]: ...Ops
Rourensu [17k\]: Onegaishimasu
RyuuzakiL [16k\]: Wrong opponent];W[pd]
(;B[nq]LB[cf:2][jp:1]SQ[qp][oq]C[xxc : this one seems too slow

4-4 are not stones played to make territory in the corner but to extend quickly along the side 
it needs a third move for a safe corner (here R5)

3-4 (and 2-5 next) are ok for a strong shpe in corner with 2 stones (square mark here for exemple)

for better choices, see var on move 4];W[dg]LB[jd:1][dj:3][cn:2]
C[xxc : too small]
(;B[dm]LB[jc:2][qf:1][ci:A]C[xxc : same

note : there is a W weakness here (important thing to remember) A

2 is interesting here (see var-6)];W[jd]C[xxc : this is a strong move]
;B[fr]LB[qf:1][pj:2]TR[se][pf][mg][jh][gi][dj][ij][ak][kk][ml]
[om][qn][so]C[xxc : too small

i have marked the possible "limit" for both sides
i think it seems clear now that the most important place is right side no ?]
;W[pj]LB[kk:1]TR[bh][di][fj][hk][jk][ll][nm][pm][rn]C[xxc : now it is center

arround 1];B[jp]LB[ij:1]C[xxc : W play 1 ???];W[oc]LB[jj:1]
[ck:3][qn:2]C[xxc : too small];B[pm]LB[ql:1]C[xxc : 1 perhaps better here

but i think center is still the way];W[qi];B[qk]LB[jj:1]C[xxc : center again here]
;W[pk];B[ql];W[pl];B[qm]
(;W[ol]LB[jk:1]C[xxc : this is a bad move (sorry)

(see var-19)

center again]
(;B[om]TR[qk][ql][pm][qm][jp][pp][nq]C[xxc : still center

this move doesn't help, this is a really important thing to understand
(see var-20)

an other important thing is that now ... black really seems to be "overconcentrated" (too much stones for not taht much points)]
;W[nl]LB[pj:A][pk:B][il:1]C[xxc : center

note that now white can go one step further each time (this is difficult and perhaps i mark the wrong place, but please remember the idea ... each stone that make the first wall A-B here stronger allow white to play a center move one more step south or one step to the left]
;B[mm]LB[hj:1]C[xxc : quite the same comment as for move 20

now it is more difficult for B to enter];W[mk]TR[fh][hi][jj]
[lk]SQ[cj][ej][gk][ik][kl]C[xxc : i let W comment aside here to explain how can B choose his move

there is now a "clear" line beetween each "moyo"  (in fact 2 ines here)

1 - B plays under his own line and this can be too small
2 - B plays over the W line and this can be dangerous (W can cut his way back and kill ?)
3 - B plays between the 2 lines

3 is the best move for sure (note that there will be more space to live in W moyo this way)]
;B[ll];W[lk];B[kl];W[kk];B[jk];W[fh]LB[jj:1][ck:2]C[xxc : wrong move i think]
;B[cj]LB[ji:1]C[xxc : the door is open ... enter (am i wrong ?)]
;W[ci];B[bj];W[bi]
(;B[ai]C[xxc : better toward the center (local only)

(see var-34)]
(;W[ah]LB[dj:2][jj:1]C[xxc : same for white of course

difficult i know, but you can studdy it in an easy way (see var-35)]

xxc : ok, always difficult to fond the best comments ... you'll discover that latter perhaps

i think B (you)(and W perhaps also) had a problem ... maybe a global problem
it seems that in the the early moves both doesn't pay too much attention of opponent moves and goes only with "his" own "territory"

for this part of the game, a "big moyo" game, there is only one way to think in the beginning --> i have to be bigger, bigger, bigger
then think about that : can i "live here" (in opponent moyo) and can he 'live here" (in yours)
A and B are good exemples (studdy by your side ;)
next, technical moves ... if i can say that (ie var-140)
i know it is as important when one's play, but "i think" there is an order to follow studying and understanding this game

the way
first oppening : why to play this stone (4-4) or this one (3-4) ... and what next of course
second middle game : where is the game ??? where ??? (center for this one, nearly all the way)
third : technical, you can find it by yourself with some help (it is the same all arround the board !!!) ... here of course how can G5 can live ???

i hope this may help you

thank u])
(;B[jm];W[jl]
(;B[im]LB[il:A]C[xxc : this is also important to understand

this move is really stronger than A])
(;B[il];W[jn];B[im];W[ko]C[xxc : small disaster again])))
(;W[jj];B[ag];W[ik]C[xxc : now how much gain in the center (W stops B) and how puch loss in the side ???]
))
(;B[dj];W[aj]
(;B[ak];W[ai];B[bl]TR[jk]C[xxc : this is ok

and better support for marked stone])
(;B[ji]LB[ji:A][ak:B]C[xxc : and what about this one ?

ok, W destroy the left side, but what about the W moyo now ?

(please don't play this way until you'r able to count, at least a good estimation of each move value 1 or B here for B)]
)))
(;B[aa]C[xxc : B plays elsewhere];W[om]C[xxc : B plays elsewhere]
;B[ba]TR[pm][qm][pp][nq]C[xxc : what can W do ?

not that much to reduce B corner i think, and B had 2 moves elsewhere]

(;B[jp]C[xxc : this one for a strong fuseki (san ren sei)])
(;B[cf]TR[qf]C[xxc : this one for a "standard" corner approach]

note that it is the one played in the game at A

next move, B can choose corner or side]))
