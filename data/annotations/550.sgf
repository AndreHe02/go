Hope you like it.];B[dp]C[Inpolite. Nothing wrong with this move but it is common to play the first move in the upper right corner.]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[cc]C[Interesting. One gets the feeling white is inconsistant in his strategy (4,4 then 3,3). Either this stone should be higher or the first white stone shouldn't be on hoshi (4,4).]

(;B[ec]C[This is wrong. An approach move like this indicates a special strategy - meaning black will endure some loss in the development here in order to gain something elswhere. The thing is this isn't a correct approach move for a joseki and if so black shouldn't play it if no special strategy requires it. See Var...]
;W[de]C[Good reply];B[hc]TR[de][hc]LB[dj:A]C[Good. Black answered correctly but there is no doubt black got the worst of this exchange (marked stones) and this cannot be called a joseki. if black had a stone around a this could be considered equal.]
;W[ch]LB[cj:A]C[Overconcentrated or underdeveloped, this should be at least at A]
;B[jp]C[Perhaps a little out of the focus of the game but surely playable.]
;W[cn]LB[pn:A]C[Bad. After C12 this makes white even more concentrated. (see var)
I find an aproach around A much better]
(;B[fo]C[Somewhat a novelty. But doesen't work well here since white can enter at 3,3 with no wories.]

(;W[bp]C[White is too helpfull.];B[cq];W[dk]LB[dl:A]C[This at A is the correct shape.]
;B[nc]TR[ec][hc]C[Black's approach is from the wrong side. Think of the two marked stones as an insurance that white will not get much territory along the top.]

(;W[lc]LB[qn:A]C[Making a pincer in situations like this is asking for trouble.
White would be better off approaching at A and dealing with the double aprroach in the upper right.]
;B[ne];W[pf];B[pb]C[Good black is playing well here.];W[qc]

(;B[qb]LB[kd:A][qh:B]C[Great if white answers but you can't count on your opponent being helpfull. A would be safe B would be very modern in style.]
;W[le];B[ng];W[ph]TR[lc]C[Since white cannot allow his marked stone to be traped this is the only way.]
;B[jc]LB[qj:A]C[Since both top groups are safe conecting them isn't that big. perhaps A?
On the other hand k17 eliminates w's shape.  But white has n18 which serves great as a connection braker and threatens the eyshape of the black group.

seems m15 was a good move.];W[lg];B[ql]LB[rb:A][pq:B]C[w should n18 first then depending on the development A or B.]
;W[qj];B[ol]TR[qj]C[1. Black is taking profit in the middle of a fight.  2. In the process he is helping the top group (the last stone is a posible connection).

excellent! thats why marked stone is bad.];W[mb]C[Good.];B[pc]
;W[qd];B[rb];W[nq]LB[od:A]C[A move at A totaly destroys black eyes for this group s18 is an overplay.
This approach is bad (see var).
In this area q3.]
(;B[lq]C[Never pincer from the strong side! Q3 for white now.]

(;W[pr]C[Bad. See var.];B[qq];W[qr];B[ni]C[Black should have answered at the bottom.]

(;B[do]C[An error by black.

See variations.];W[em];B[fn];W[el];B[fm]C[This last few moves turn the game into whites favor.

;B[tt];W[tt]C[White wins by 1pt + komi 0.5.pts = 1.5pts

White won this game on endgame - Black should seriously devote some of his time to that study that area of go. And also keep counting throughout the game. If you were you wouldn't play so defensivly in endgame.
Anyway nice game... Hope my comments help.

I'd like to send this review to "sisi" also; pls. email me if I may...
