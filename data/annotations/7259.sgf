AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hi,
Thanks for reviewing my game. I was lost most of the game and really did know what direction I should move in.
Thanks,
Van Livieratos

Hi, Van, I'm Rex Santoro. Presently I play mostly on Dragon Go Server where I am 7 kyu. You say that you were lost most of the game, but even if you did feel that way most of your moves were correct. You also said you cannot fight, but you invaded White's moyo and lived. I disagree with you, I think you played a good game.

I will precede my comments with RS.];W[po];B[np];W[no]
(;B[lp]C[I had know idea how to answer move three...

RS: This is fine. Another possibility is p4.];W[op];B[nq]C[RS: Good.]
;W[mo];B[lo]C[RS: Also good.];W[ln];B[oq];W[pq];B[pr];W[qq]
;B[ip]C[RS: Good! Your last 3 moves were all good. Especially Bj4 for 2 reasons: 1) It is an excellenet distance from your m4 wall, and 2) instead of Bj4, you did not continue with r2, but switched to j4.]
;W[kn]
(;B[cq]C[RS: Another possibility would be c10.];W[in]
(;B[gp]C[RS: I understand the desire to protect the bottom, but if you play the variation there are a 3 advantages explained at the end of the variation.]
;W[gn]
(;B[cn]C[RS: If you wanted to play in this direction, this is a bit too close. Considering how strong the bottom is with c3, c10 or d10 would be better. See variations.]

;B[cg];W[dg];B[ce];W[ch];B[df];W[bg];B[be]C[RS: Good!];W[cf]
C[RS: W played wrongly here, and your next move was correct.]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[ff];W[fg];B[gd]C[I know I can't defend well when I have a unit across the sixth row and I had know acsess to the meddle so I tried move 42.

RS: No one can defend if move 42 were played at g14. If B42 were at g14 & and I were W, I'd immediately play g17. I think this is a good move.]
;W[gf];B[ge];W[hf]
(;B[qc]C[RS: Ok, I understand the move, but W is now getting 3 walls of a large moyo. I think a better move could be either a or b.]
;W[oe]C[RS: You see! W wants a center moyo. Now Bq10 would be very good. Your 2 stones in the corner are absolutely safe. If W plays on 1 side you play on the other.]
;B[nc];W[od];B[oc];W[md];B[pi]C[RS: Good!];W[pe]

RS: No, you played correctly.];B[mm];W[mk];B[nk];W[lm]C[RS: This is a snap-back. If W takes at m9, you immediately retake at m8. If you worried about not getting a 2nd eye, don't be. See variations.

However, if you're not fairly positive that you can do this, then you played safely and correctly.]
