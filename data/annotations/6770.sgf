(;B[cm]C[Kosai [2k\]: My thought here was that if W C5 I can C10, and the bottom is still open.  Maybe I should just K16?

I dont like this move. 
K16 is not good eather because mormaly you dont want to make a double wing formation like this from a 44 point.]

white has more influence but black has more secure points.]

;B[le];W[ng]
(;B[og]C[I dont like this move.
1) it is not good shape
2) it attaches to a weak stone, strenthening it.
3) ist does not secure the corner or the right side.

there is a running fight going on on the right side and black plays tenuki. Black does not need another group now. by the way: the white corner is not easy to secure, so the chance to do something here will last long.]

you are wondering about your fuseki, but you did not loose ground there. 
s5 is -1 point if you dont have a concrete variation up your sleeve.
I guess you must rather practice live and death than joseki and fuseki.]

Well, it defends agains the o9 cut, but there are bigger endgame moves to do this.]
;W[dn];B[pl]C[here is my offer: have a close look at the live and death problems in this corner and send me an EMail with an sgf.
I will have a look at you analysis then. This is the road to shodan. I could type some variation but you will not learn a lot, if you dont think about the problem here first.]

I am sure you did NOT loose this game in the fuseki.

Your general problem seems to be the wrong use of forcing exchanges!
Try to figure out who profits more from a move pair evary time you force your oponant in one way or the other.
However, you lost the game in the lower left corner, in the middle game.]
