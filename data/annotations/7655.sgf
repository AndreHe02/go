pachi2 [2k\]: GTP Engine for pachi2 (white): Pachi UCT Engine version 4.99 (Dosaku-devel): I'm playing UCT. When I'm losing, I will resign, if I think I win, I play until you pass. Anyone can send me 'winrate' in private chat to get my assessment of the position.
usagi5 [5k\]: hi!];W[jc]C[How should I respond to this? I decided the star-point was the best.]
;B[dd]C[g4: Absolutely OK.];W[qk]C[White plays on the side again.]
;B[qf]C[I play here, trying to close the corner. I am also thinking that if white approaches at R6, then R5, Q6, O4. Maybe that would not have been good, though. White would then get a big side with R 12.

g4: Nothing against it.];W[ck]C[White plays on the side again.]
;B[cf];W[kq];B[qn]C[I decided to block the corner from this side, thinking white will have to play R12.

g4: White has placed 4 loely stones. It seems that he doesn't want you to get a big moyo. But 4 corners are OK too.]
;W[ll]C[White play out at M8. How should I respond to this?

g4: This move makes no territory. It just surrounding the corner very losely. Because it is so losely, black may ignore this move. If black tries to get out, white get a strong outside position. But if you extend from your last  corner, I do not see, hoe white can catch up in territory.]
;B[ko]C[I decided a capping move was best.

g4: It is always good, to block the connection.];W[mp];B[qi]
C[Next, I decide to expand while squeezing white.

g4: Why did you cap? I would had capped to deny white's connection. Now a couple of moves around P6 connect most of the white stones and a mojo begins to appear.
I would prefer N5, denying white's connection.];W[hp]C[g4: Now you nearly wasted one move (L4).]
;B[jp]C[g4: If you want to cut K3 is right.];W[jq];B[fq]C[I protect my last open corner.

g4: You could have done this without the two moves in the center. Try to catch the big picture. If L5 and K4 and K3 and O4 were not there, do you want to play K4 and L5 provoking K4 and H4?]
;W[hn]C[g4: Now white has a target for an attack.];B[km]C[Here, a fight is beginning. I decided that it was most important to jump out.

g4: If you want to get out white will get very strong on the outside. All4 corners are still open. This could lead to a close game.]
;W[mn]C[White blocks one side.];B[lm]C[g4: Play this only if you want to cut. You might want to cut at N7 perhaps. Leaving this unplayed gives you the option later.]
;W[mm];B[ml]C[I cut, hoping it will help.

g4: Risky. But may be good if you are willing to sacrifice the 4 stones. They are nearly unimportant now and you can get outside influence for yourself.]
;W[kk];B[im];W[ik];B[hm];W[iq]C[g4: Not necessary now. F6 puts black on the spot.]
;B[gl];W[nl];B[mk];W[cm];B[co]C[I decide that making my corner as safe as possible is necessary.

g4: This is big. AND helps black to escape. A good move!];W[nk]
;B[mj];W[ki];B[mh];W[fm];B[gj];W[jg];B[je]C[I thought a this move was good because it pressured the K17 stone and split white's groups.

g4: Splitting is only good if you leave two weak groups. Both white groups are not so weak The center group can lean on your center group to get strength. The stone at the top can extend easily. If you squeeze the white center group an force it to kill your center group while getting the complete top for it, this will be a reasonable plan. But complicated. I would simple have played F12 to ensure the connection to the corner stones.]
;W[lf];B[md];W[nf];B[og];W[gi];B[ej];W[fi];B[el];W[fl];B[fk]
;W[em];B[dl];W[dm];B[ci]C[g4: D11 is stronger connection. This leaves a cutting point.]
;W[gm];B[hk];W[ij]
(;B[om]C[I nozoki.

g4: This gives no territory. It helps only white to get connected and therefore stronger. P3 protecting the corner and threatening the cut seems better.
I would prefer F11 puting some pressure on the center group and secure your center group for sure.]
;W[di]C[How should I respond to this?

g4: You must cut throuh as long as it is possible.];B[dj];W[cg]
;B[ch];W[dg];B[cj];W[bg];B[cl]C[g4: This is what white was hoping for. You have to struggle for life weakening your positions on the outside.]
;W[bl];B[bk]C[This sequence resulted in life, but may not have been the best. My upper left corner is damaged.

g4: This is NOT clearly living. I see only one eye. Play J6 now. This threatens to cut at G6 and gives a second eye at K6 in sente. After this White has no more chance.]
;W[nm];B[id]C[I decide to press down on the K17 stone. I thought that afterwards I could protect my corner with E17 while squeezing the white group.]
;W[ic];B[hf]C[I thought it was necessary to do something like this. Maybe H15 would have been better?

g4: Normally you wanted to press further at G16 of H17 for example. If you intend to connect to you big snake while threatening H17 this is good.]
;W[fd];B[ec]C[g4: If white separates the 3 stones from the rest allowing them only to connect to the one eyed group you might lose all. It might by wiser to play H17 now. White can't cut thanks to H14. White will get the corner but black will get the top. And then connect to the big snake.]
;W[ld]C[How should I respond to this? I am finding that my group is in danger now.

g4: Yes your 3 stones look dead now. Sacrifice them. B7 gives you two eyes too.]
(;B[mc];W[gc];B[kd];W[lc];B[le]C[Here, I failed to notice that white could atari at N15.]
;W[me];B[ke]C[g4: This is nothing. It doesn't give you an eye. It threatens to get 2 white stones, so it forces white to connect. You are making white stronger. If you get into such a situation you may want to L14 to play a ko. This is a flower viewing ko for black. Your stones are dead already.]
;W[kc];B[fe]C[Now the situation is dire.];W[ee];B[ef];W[df]
;B[de];W[ed];B[hh]C[Here, I thought that if white defended at H11, I could loosely connect my stones with E12.]
;W[hi];B[eh];W[eg];B[fg];W[ff];B[fh];W[mi]C[g4: This is your chance. You must beware of the fact that your group don't have 2 definte eyes. Abort this 3 black stones. Get a second eye. protect one corner and you will win.]
;B[ni];W[dh];B[ei];W[nd];B[nc];W[in];B[jm];W[oc];B[od];W[ne]
;B[ob];W[ie]C[g4: White is trying to leave your group eyeless while he wants to protect his own center group that is also lacking eyes.]
;B[if];W[ih];B[gf];W[pc];B[qc];W[ge];B[he]C[g4: This is an unimportant stone. Your stones are connected. It doesn't make an eye. B7 or G12 make a second eye.]
;W[ng];B[oi];W[hl];B[il];W[li];B[nj];W[nh]C[g4: Now it is critical. White has managed to get 2 eyes for his center group which is alive now.]
;B[ce]C[I finally get around to fixing my corner's horrible shape.

g4: Forget the corner.];W[cc]C[White starts some trouble.

g4: This is severe. If you want the corner you have to play B17 or so. But it is not so easy. Maybe it is dead as it stands.]
(;B[dc];W[cb];B[fb]C[g4: You have to B16. If white play B16 his is alive. And then you are dead unconditionally.]
;W[bd];B[be]C[g4: A wasted move.];W[eq]C[Then white jumps into the bottom corner.]
;B[ep];W[fp];B[fo]C[I play this thinking hoping to keep sente after I capture the E3 stone by using the cut at G6.]
;W[gp];B[er];W[gb];B[db];W[eo];B[en];W[fn];B[oq]C[I decided this move was the biggest.]
;W[bm]C[g4: I think white should have played B10. If you take the stone now you have 2 eyes.]
;B[bh];W[ag]C[g4: Taking save the day. B10 also.];B[ae]C[g4: You have to decide. Do you want the corner are life for your group?]
;W[bj];B[ak];W[cr]C[g4: ??];B[cq];W[bq];B[bp];W[pb];B[pa];W[dr]
;B[dq];W[pk];B[mr];W[lp];B[lb];W[aj]C[g4: This is it];B[dk]
;W[br]C[g4: These are dead. You can leave them alone.];B[bn]
C[I misread here. I thought I needed to do this, but it loses me sente. My giant sente group is in severe danger if white plays F10. This move is the losing move, I am afraid.

g4: You have to read carefully.];W[an]C[Maybe instead of responding to this, I should let white make the ko after I fix my big group.]
;B[ao];W[fj]C[Now white kills.];B[gr]C[Actually, this move lost sente as well. But I think white could have cause trouble if I hadn't. The middle group is bigger though, I think. I should have just played G12! (Or K16, or K14, or H16; all make a second eye)

g4: Or A11. Yes];W[qb];B[rb];W[nb];B[qa];W[gh]C[Now I am 100% dead. Is there any way for me to live?

g4: A11. If then White A8 then you take the 2 stones. But you have to abort the 10 stones above. But never mind That are only 30 points. Not enough for white to win.]
;B[gg];W[al]C[g4: Now you are dead. Game over.];B[ck];W[hd]
;B[jf];W[jd]
(;B[lk]C[Here I just try not-quite-randomn moves with vague, hopeful ideas in mind.

g4: Maybe L13 or L14 are worth a try.];W[kl];B[kj];W[lj];B[jn]
;W[ln];B[lh];W[kh];B[kg];W[lg];B[ii]C[Here I am on byou-yomi, so if there is any tesuji, I don't have time to read it.]
