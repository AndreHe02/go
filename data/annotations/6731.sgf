C[PM:  Thanks for reviewing my game!  I took white, and I'm in the middle of a horrible losing streak.  Any advice you have to give me would be great, particularly in fuseki and life/death situations.

FishGo: Hello, I am FishGo.  Glad to review your game.  In this game both players had a lot of blunders.  I think in Fuseki you made some weak shapes and they crippled you a bit in the later combats.  Perhaps you can also pay more attention to direction of attacks.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[cf];W[gd]C[FishGo:This move was fashionable in the 70s to the 80s but Pros have completely abandoned it because of its weakness in shape.]
;B[dh]LB[di:A][dj:B][ci:C]C[FishGo:A,B,C seems to be better points for black.]
;W[ce]C[FishGo: Not sure about this move, 3-3 is still open.  See variation.]

(;B[jc]C[FishGo: In my opinion, a little early.];W[nc];B[hc]
;W[gc]C[FishGo:Bad exchange for black.];B[hb];W[gb]C[FishGo:White secured the corner and black got next to nothing.]
;B[qf]
(;W[qh]CR[hc][hb][jc]LB[od:A]C[FishGo: The pincer seems possible but I am not sure.  The marked group is not so weak and the large knight enclosure has some weakness.  Defending at A is also possible, see variation.]
;B[of]MA[rd][od][pd][pi][oh]LB[pc:A]C[FishGo:This is invasion point at A with the large knights move.  After this move, black has a lot of points to choose to help this group.  For this reason it is hard for white to attack effectively now.]
;W[pk]LB[oh:A][qj:B][qk:C]C[FishGo: A little slack, A, B or C are better choices.]
;B[qm]C[FishGo: The white two space-extention has no "root".]
;W[nq]
(;B[lq]LB[pq:A]C[FishGo:Defending at A also possible.];W[qq]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo]LB[po:A]C[FishGo:Wrong move, A is joseki.]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[po];B[qn];W[pr];B[oo]
(;W[pn]LB[or:A]C[FishGo:Too greedy, should have connected with A, see vartaion.]
;B[op];W[om]LB[rp:A]C[FishGo:White is only escaping here.  Black can live by capturing at A.  White is too thin in the corner to start a fight.]
;B[rp];W[rq];B[so]
(;W[oq]LB[or:A]C[FishGo:Mistake, there is bad aji in this move.  Better to connect at A.]
;B[mo]LB[qr:A]C[FishGo:The cut at A, works, see variation.]

(;B[on]C[FishGo:Uneccessary.];W[pm];B[lo];W[rk];B[rl]C[FishGo:White should play elsewhere.  See variations.]

(;W[sl];B[sm];W[ql];B[sk];W[sj];B[sl];W[rj]C[FishGo: White got close to nothing and ended up in Gote.]
;B[me]MA[ne][mf][ld][ke]LB[od:A]C[FishGo:White should take the chance to repair at A and aim at the marked weak points.]
;W[lc];B[kd]LB[od:A]C[FishGo:A is still urgent.];W[hd]C[FishGo:This move is small.]
;B[id];W[df]C[FishGo:This move is also small.];B[fn]C[PM:  This move seemed unreasonable to me, and I thought I could take this advantage to invade the southwest side..unfortunately black held on to a large chunk of the bottom that I spent the rest of the game trying to break into.

FishGo:This move is rather unusual but at the least it expands black moyo.]
;W[lp]C[FishGo:A wasted move.];B[kp]MA[cf][dh]LB[df:A][fk:B]
C[FishGo: White needs to attack the marked group to justify the move at A. Ideally white would build influence around B thus reducing black's moyo.]
;W[cn]
(;B[cl]C[FishGo: Wrong direction.    White should take the 3-3.  See variation.]

(;W[cp];B[cq];W[bp]
(;B[dq]LB[bq:A]C[FishGo:Black should definately block at A.  See variation.]

;W[cg];B[ch]LB[bo:A]C[FishGo:White needs to play A for life.]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[lr];B[kr];W[mr];B[ko]C[FishGo: Absolutely useless move.]
;W[mm]LB[km:A][bo:B]C[FishGo:Now A is clearly urgent for both sides.  Well,  second to B that would kill the white group.]
;B[he]LB[km:A]C[FishGo:Very small.];W[ge];B[hf];W[gf];B[oh]
LB[km:A]C[FishGo: Still not as big as A.];W[pg];B[pf];W[og]
;B[ng];W[km];B[pc]LB[qc:A]C[PM:  At this point I was starting to wish I had chosen the knights-move to enclose the corner...better response to this invasion?

FishGo: You responded all right and you had a chance to kill the group cleanly.  I can't say if the small knights move would be better, the problem is you had chances to defend but you didn't.  Black is very thick on the outside it is hard for white to come out in one piece.]
;W[pd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb];W[rd];B[oc];W[od];B[nb];W[mb];B[nd]
;W[mc]LB[pb:A]C[FishGo:Black needs to play at to make a ko.]
;B[na]C[FishGo: White A is still ko.]

;W[sf];B[rh];W[sh];B[qi];W[ri];B[qj];W[pi];B[ph];W[pj];B[qg]
;W[qk];B[qh]C[FishGo:Small.

FishGo: Black is comfortably ahead here.  Both sides made some mistakes after.  White had a chance to kill a black group late in the game for which I included a variation.

In summary:  In fuseki, you have to pay more attention in making good shapes thus setting bases for development and combat later in the game.  You tend to play too lightly early in the game.  Hope you find this review useful.  Feel free to contact me if you have any more questions.
