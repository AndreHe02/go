C[Hello, I'm wilouf and  I played black, komi=0,5 . I'm 15k on KGS and white was 6k. It's was impossible to predict that I would lose by 7,5 moku only.
I would like to know what were the good and bad aspects im my play and the reasons why white did'nt crush me ^_^

Thanks by advance.

csh: Overall, your play was not bad. I would suggest trying not to make weak groups, and to concentrate more on the endgame. If Black kept sente in the endgame, the game would be much different.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp]
(;B[fc]LB[qk:C][qo:A][eq:B]C[Is it the better place to attack with this opening ?

csh: General opening theory states the most important move is to take an empty corner. After that, completing a shimari (corner enclosure) at A or preventing White from making a shimari at B are the biggest moves. Note that since your stones are in this position, it is also possible to play the Chinese Opening at C. I included variations from pro games.]
;W[cf]C[csh: Since you cannot invade the corner after he makes the knight's move, usually you slide into the corner to keep white from having the entire corner.]

(;B[id];W[qo];B[np]
(;W[ql]C[csh: This just looks unfinished to me. Perhaps you should just take the whole corner at R4. White would have not gotten much out of his approach move at R5.]

(;B[fq]C[I didn't play closer to his stone to prevent a pincer

csh: I don't think that you necessarily fear the pincer in this situation. I show alternate approach moves (kakari).]
;W[dq]C[This move seems slow, doesn't it ?

csh: It is a slow move, but it is also the correct one. White now firmly has this corner, and he can attack your stone at F3 without having to worry about the security of the lower left corner. Since the corner is secure, he can also make a large extension along the left side. This move is the main reason why your approach is too soft.]
;B[ip];W[dk]C[csh: This makes a big framework (moyo) on the left. It is hard to invade because both the lower left corner and the upper left corner are relatively secure.]
;B[cm]C[Was it right to attack this early in the game ?

csh: I think that an extension down the right-hand side would be bigger than invading. The problem is that your stone is stuck between two relatively strong groups. The lower left corner is secure, and the white stones above should turn into a living group. The weak group that this invasion creates becomes a liability for the duration of the game.]
;W[ck]C[csh: This move is a little slow, but it threatens to make a lot of territory up the lefthand side of the board.]
;B[em];W[fp]C[csh: White starts a splitting attack. By leaning on your stones at the bottom, he will strengthen his corner group, while cutting off Black's two invasion stones.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[go];W[fn];B[fl];W[gm];B[fj]C[csh: Now Black must play moves just to run away. With each move White plays, White is solidifying more and more territory.]
;W[ei];B[hk];W[nc]C[csh: This seems like the wrong direction for White. I think approaching along the righthand side is better.]
;B[lc];W[qf]C[csh: White makes a double approach.];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[of];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rg]TR[lc][nc]C[csh: While this was joseki, this was no good for White.

The trade of the marked stones was in Black's favor.]
(;B[qh]C[I wanted to try it out, is it such a mistake ?

csh: Forcing moves (kikashi) are a good part of the game. However, I don't think this is good in this situation.The problem is that if White connects, it doesn't help out your position. See the variation.]
;W[qg]
(;B[oi]C[csh: The other part of forcing moves is that you are supposed to be able to abandon them, and leave them for later. If you think of the righthand side of White's potential territory, Black invaded with one stone, and White answered, so there was no change in the score. By trying to pull out the forcing move, Black is creating another weak group (besides the one in the lower left) which will come under attack.]
;W[pi]C[He surprised me with this move, I was expecting Q12.

csh: This move is a little odd.];B[pj];W[oh]
(;B[oj]C[I felt that move was not flexible enough.

csh: It isn't flexible, but you are throwing good stones after bad ones. These stones really need to jump out and connect to something, even if a few of them get captured. Now that they are firmly connected together, they become a greater liability.]

[jk][kk][lk][mk][nk][ok][il][jl][kl][ll][ml][nl][hm][im][jm]
[km][lm][mm][in][jn][kn][ln][jo][ko]C[csh: Black managed to connect back. This is a good sequence for black. Note that the cut at O11 (A) is protected by a ladder, so you must be careful if White plays a ladder breaker. I marked possible ladder breakers for White.]

;W[me];B[nd]C[I thougt he would play N16and hurt me a lot

csh: N16 doesn't seem to work.]
(;W[qj]C[But he played elsewere, was it a misread ?

csh: No, see the variation.];B[md]LB[if:B][jh:A]TR[me][mf][nf]
C[csh: I understand that you were worried about N16. If you weren't, it would have been better to play out further and capture the triangled stones on a large scale with a play at A or B. I think Black would be way ahead.]
;W[jg];B[kf]TR[jg]C[csh: Black potential territory has been greatly reduced by this trade.]
;W[hg]TR[fj][hk][fl][cm][em]C[csh: These two stones also somewhat cut off the escape route for black's weak group.]

(;B[qi]TR[fj][hk][fl][cm][em]C[csh: It is much more important to lead out the weak black group.]

(;B[mh];W[mj];B[om];W[rl]
(;B[mk]TR[fj][hk][fl][cm][em]C[Was Q6 better ?

csh: It's tough to say. Personally, I don't think the Q6 stone is that important. If Black Q6, can the weak Black group connect out?]
;W[pn];B[lj];W[nn];B[mm];W[ki];B[li];W[il];B[ik];W[jl];B[jk]
;W[kl];B[kj];W[lo]C[csh: Because Black had to run with the weak group, White gains strength to reduce Black's potential territory at the bottom.]
;B[lp];W[ko];B[kp];W[eb]C[csh: This is the key part to why the margin of victory was like this. I suspect that White thought that he was ahead at this point, so he wanted to start solidifying his territory by playing endgame moves. When the borders are thickened, it's much harder for either side to invade if they are behind.]
;B[fb];W[fe];B[ec]C[I regretted this move when I realized it was gote ^_^

csh: This move isn't gote, really.];W[dc]LB[gf:E][bl:A][bo:B]
[rp:D][er:C]C[csh: At this point in the game, Black should look for big moves. This game is still within reach. A, B, C, and D come to mind.

Did you realize you were behind? If you are behind, you should play more aggressively to try and catch up. I think E might be interesting.]

(;B[db]C[csh: This move is the gote one. :)

csh: Just for fun, I added a variation where Black played more sente in endgame, and White answered all the moves.]

In the endgame, Black should take more time to determine which are the biggest points in the endgame, taking the sente moves first. Spending just a little more time to find sente moves could drastically change the outcome of the endgame.]
