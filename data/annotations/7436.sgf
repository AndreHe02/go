C[k43r [1k\]: hi and hafe fun
claudel [1d\]: hi

Hi!
I am k43r, and i can't breeak to 1k kgs. This game brought me back to 2k for 10th time! Where do i need to improve? What book do i need to read, and where should i focus next time?

M:
Hi, i'm Marc from Germany, right now studying Baduk in Korea. I play as around 3d and will try to answer your questions and point out the mistakes i see in your game ;)
Check the final move for a short summary.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc]
;W[ce];B[co];W[dq];B[cj]C[Correct extension?

M: definatly, this extension is vital for both sides, so it is good, i you can take it first ;)]
;W[fd]
(;B[de]C[I don't have to fear Taisha, because it's me who have additional stones nearby.

M: and you don't have to fear the simplifying variations, because it is you who already occupied the extension, which White would need after those simple variations. If white can not get his normal extensions, i think, they give quite good results for black ;) I would prefer to simplify here.]
;W[dd];B[ed];W[cd];B[ec];W[ee];B[fe];W[df];B[ef]C[There is no ko in fuseki, right?

M: normal joseki is played like this ;)];W[eg];B[de]
(;W[ff]C[M: that move doesn't make sense to me... Following the joseki would be better for sure. This move doesn't really improve whites position, and white misses his chance to get the corner.]
;B[ee];W[dg]
(;B[cc]C[I've readen once, that in Taisha it's important to get san-san. It gives you base, and removes it from enemy.. Here i feel white is left without nothing. After b13 white has one eye, and has to fight in center, while black takes territory both sites.

M: Yes and no - Yes, it is big and vital, and white missed the chance to get it, but no, i would not play it right away. I think you have to make an exchange before.]
;W[gf]C[M: Painful, but still the game is preferable for black here]

(;B[hd];W[cl];B[ep]C[M: good way to play];W[eq];B[fp];W[fq]
;B[dk]
(;W[em];B[el];W[gm];B[dm]C[White is too soft?
M: yes, white wasted a lot of aji here and played too slack. I would leave this for later.]
;W[en];B[dn];W[gp]C[M: Now white has settled the whole bottom right, ending in completly gote with no aji left. Bad.]
;B[fh]C[Correct to tenuki?
M: definatly.];W[fg];B[bg];W[bh];B[ch];W[cg];B[bi];W[bf];B[ah]

(;W[bc]C[M: bad, center more important, no points or 2 eyes here]
;B[bb];W[bd]C[Gote eye.
M: true, as said on move 48];B[if]C[Good direction? good shape?

M: yes, i like it - increasing your top potential and white can not afford to let you play G12 now.]
;W[gh]
(;B[ih]C[Good direction, good shape?
M: To me: No. You already got your profit, now it is time to cash out. This move is not completly sente, not improving you position that much and an attack on white is not easy. It is uncertain what you will get for it.
White can not defend his group anyway, if you play a big move now, since he would fall behind to much in terms of territory. So later you might reevaluate what is the best move.]
;W[nc]C[How to punish this tenuki?

M: Tenuki is correct. As i said, there is no severe continuation for you. I would just continue at the top, and again, leave the left for later.]
;B[fi]C[F12 seems important, as it allows me to peep at h13. Correct to take it out with f11?

M: too early. White can easily get out, you get nothing by settling this postion right now]
;W[gi];B[hg]C[Good timing?

M: i think the overall attack is bad timing, before peeping i would also play F10, is too painful otherwise.]
;W[fj];B[ei];W[gg];B[gj]C[M: There is nothing to attack. completly useless and unnecessary, maybe later there would be again some aji (e.g. with G9 or other moves) or you would just want to play J10 in sente.]
;W[hj];B[gk];W[ii];B[hk];W[ik]C[M: White can be very satisfied. Black gained 5 points, white is out and stable in the center, no aji left, and white's invasion is already in place. Desaster for black.]
;B[il];W[jk]C[White too soft?];B[hl]
(;W[go]C[M: White should continue on the top or right side, black playing here isn't that big, since white can double hane.]
;B[lc];W[ld]C[How to handle this stone? I don't want to make points from wall :<
M: White will settle easily here anyway, so you have to reduce your ambitions here a little bit. Actually this move might be a bad exchange.]

(;B[kc]C[M: this is good for you ;)];W[qc]
(;B[rc]C[M: why??? This is very submissive];W[pc];B[re];W[kd]

(;B[jd]C[again, submissive, you have to push first];W[mc];B[je]
C[M: very painful, you completly lost you topmoyo without any compensation.]
;W[me];B[qh]C[White found his base, so there is no way to attack him. Higher move will be countered by playing on right side. Correct move?

M: Blacks position on the right side is bad, so this might be the best move, even though it hurts to play it.]
;W[qm]C[M: White is able to grab the big points now and the game has turned around.]

(;B[pr]C[I wanted to create group on lower side. Simple r3, when white blocks at q4 is not satysfing me. Correct idea? Correct technique? q3 would be better?

M: R3 is bad, correct, i personally prefer Q3, but i'm myself, but that's just my opinion. Can not say, which one is better]
;W[pq];B[or];W[qr];B[lq];W[jq]
(;B[kr]C[M: bad style, just jump out. You create Aji against you at N2 and the exchange might be bad. Also you take away the option of K2.]
;W[jr];B[lo];W[qj]C[M: Big and painful, also now white might consider R1 in response to S2.]
;B[ji]C[M:??? White is alive anywhere, what is the point of this? Just endgame left.]
;W[ab];B[ba]C[c18 better?];W[cb];B[db];W[jl];B[jm]C[M: suicide, white is alive, nothing to attack there. Just play normal endgame and you can still win.]
;W[km];B[kn];W[lm];B[lk];W[ll]C[White too soft?

M: no, you are just wasting moves and burying yourself, and white does not feel like punishing immediatly. J7 is like a damokles sword over your head already]
;B[kj]C[Too heavy? I liked this shape,

M: i don't. 5 in row is another game. K10 and L9 would be sente anyway, but the whole sequence here is damaging you and unneccessary.]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[mp];B[lp];W[bp]C[M: now white even can start the endgame, while you got nothing in the center]
;B[bo];W[cp];B[ri];W[ao];B[an];W[ap];B[rj]C[Correct tenuki?
M: yes];W[rk];B[qs];W[rr];B[bm];W[ps];B[os]C[M: ??? You have to defend J7 (white should have played J7 long time ago) Even with out that problem there, defending that one stone at R1 isn't big]
;W[mr];B[mq];W[np];B[qb]C[M: J7...];W[pb];B[rb];W[ms];B[ls]
;W[jn];B[jo];W[im];B[jp];W[fk]C[This decided game, right?
M: No, Your 2 aimless attacks on the white group decided the game, this here was just the consequence, even though little bit delayed. Game is almost over now.
I will not comment on the endgame moveorder, except for some obvious things.]

M:
You got a good lead in the opening, since you were able to outplay white on the left side. But afterwards you missed the point to stop pushing white and just solidifying your lead. Instead you gambled on an uncertain attack. White accepted the challenge, but your attack failed and you settled the center and also the top right without getting anything as compensation. White was able to take the big points and evened out the game. When you decided to attacks whites already living group again in the center, you lost not just sente, but also J7 let your position collapse. 

Overall you should rethink your reasoning behind attacks. You do not attack for the sake of attacking but for achieving a certain goal (making profit, settling a group, erasing aji, creating aji, getting strong, whatever) and there is no point in attacking a group, which can not be attacked right now. Especially when it is uncertain, what you can get, it is sometimes just better to keep the possibilities for later.]

The 3rd line move might also work, it is a matter of style, like this there are invasions on the top stil possible, but you would get the right as comepnsation, the lower move gives you the whole top, but you have less potential on the right.]
