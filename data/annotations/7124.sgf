C[Hello,

Hereafter i added some comments and variations to help you tink about this game of you. 
I tried to point out which, according to me, where the most important mistakes. 
My comments are preceded with "N:"

Kind regards
Nelis (Lambic)];B[dc];W[dp];B[qd];W[ce]
(;B[fd]C[N: personally, i like the Shusaku-move more, since it puts more pressure on the white stone]
;W[oq]
(;B[qp];W[pn];B[op];W[pp];B[po];W[pq]C[N: be aware that there are many deviations possible from the main-branche of the taisha. Maybe they are less popular, but often more easy to play.]

(;B[qo];W[oo]
(;B[np]C[N: this is the most popular variation, you must be aware that this is mainly a 'fighting joseki'. If you don't like this so much, here was still a chance to deviate.]
;W[qq];B[qn];W[mr]C[N: i don't think this move is joseki];B[on]
;W[no]
(;B[pm]C[s: I wanted the thickness with the upper right corner.

N: In that case you should have chosen one of the earlier variations! It is not trivial to see directly how black could punish white, but it seems clear to me that you should fight.]
;W[mo]C[N: I think white can be happy with this result]
(;B[mm];W[od]
(;B[pf];W[qc];B[rc]
(;W[pc]
(;B[re];W[ld]C[N: this is a strange play by white.
Fourth line aims at development: how does white want to develop?]

(;B[ic]C[N: right direction!
But nevertheless this is much too timid, i think it is an important mistake.]

(;W[cc];B[cb];W[dd]
(;B[bc]C[s: is E17 better in this situation?

N: consistent is the appropriate word, i think this too is an important mistake, these moves are from a basic joseki, but the other stones do matter! 
You played a very territory oriented move with J17, and now you give it all away.]
;W[ec];B[cd];W[db];B[cc];W[ed];B[be];W[cf]C[N: now look at the lonely black sones on top.]
;B[ff];W[fe];B[ge];W[ee];B[gf];W[gd]
(;B[fc];W[hd];B[gb];W[fb];B[gc];W[id];B[jd];W[hc];B[hb];W[ib]
;B[jc];W[ha];B[ie];W[ga];B[jf]C[s: I thought that the white capture was not so big and my thickness useful, since the left and bottom are still open

N: i think it is a big capture and i certainly would not call those black stones thickness. "Heavy" and "not yet alive" come to mind.]
;W[ke];B[je]LB[ig:A]C[N: 'A' is now a weak point];W[nf];B[og]
;W[lg]C[N: now white has separated the stones];B[lb];W[mb];B[lc]
;W[mc];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[jp]C[N: after this territory-like move of white, it is the time to do a quick evaluation of the situation. 

* Black has a weak group on top
* White has no weak group, the top right group seems stable enough.
* Black has one main area that should become territory wich is still open 
*White has made a nice capture on top and has territory on the bottom, but one weak spot left.
* When i try to estimate (not easy) i thinks black will be behind if he continues to play peacefully (no invasions, so i would also opt to make an invasion to stirr trouble.]
;B[hp];W[bf];B[ad];W[dl]C[N: nice move];B[en];W[cl]
(;B[fl]C[N: i feel this move helps white more then it helps you, i would play G6 right away.]
;W[dk]C[N: now white has become a lot strong];B[gn];W[ho];B[io]
;W[ip];B[gp];W[go];B[fo];W[hn];B[ep];W[fq];B[eq];W[gq];B[fr]
;W[gr];B[hm];W[hq]C[s: the corner is big, I have some aji left at L5. Unfortunately, the weakness E5 remains]

(;B[di];W[ci];B[ch];W[cj];B[eh];W[bh];B[bm];W[bk];B[gm]C[s: still not enough to defend E5
N: on the other hand, it would not have won you the game if white played good]
;W[fk];B[gj];W[gk]
(;B[kh];W[lh];B[ki];W[li]C[N: you damage the right]
(;B[ek]C[s: the cut is bad. I lost the middle territory and sente, too

N: the mistake is that you should not try to make territory in the middle, you have the right side for that.]
;W[ej];B[el];W[ei];B[fj];W[fi];B[gi];W[fh];B[eg];W[gh];B[hh]
;W[hg];B[hi];W[gg];B[ig];W[ol];B[mj]C[s: Is O9 better?

N: that is not the important point, see previous comment];W[nn]
;B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[nh];B[oi];W[oh];B[ph];W[lj];B[jk]C[s: wrong side. W still cannot move out with G9, I think

N: nope];W[nk];B[ml];W[nj];B[ni];W[mk];B[pl];W[ok];B[pk];W[ll]

(;B[lm]C[s: Wrong side again. I think L7 is better];W[km];B[kl]
;W[lk];B[kn];W[jm];B[ln];W[in]C[N: catastrophical exchange]
;B[rb];W[dr];B[er];W[do];B[eo];W[dn];B[dm];W[cm];B[em];W[bq]
C[s: from here, I lost control in the semeai

N: well, i think there was not really a better way, just painfull for you that the semeai existed]

;B[qj];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[kf];W[lf];B[mh]C[s: I overlooked that W is connected now. Without the connection, I would have tried to kill the group and, in not succeeding, cutting some stones off]
