;AB[dp][pp][pd]C[Hi
This game just amazed me, it was so peacefull and 
uncontrolled... well you'll just see.
Thanks a lot for the time you'll take for reviewing.
MOYOOOOO!!!];W[ee]LB[cd:A][ce:B][dd:C]C[romain: this move always annoying to me, i don't know 
how to approach it. but with handicap, i thought best way 
to limit it's effect was a very counter-influence move 
(which proved wrong later but, whatever...)
There's tons of ways to deal with this stone.
Most popularly are the komoku (A), the mokuhazushi (B) 
the san-san invasion, or the shoulder hit (C).]
(;B[jj];W[cn];B[fp];W[dj];B[cd]C[romain: ok here's my attempt. enclosed easily, i was not 
very satisfied
I disagree, you got a large corner and werent really 
enclosed.
His three stones increase in "height" from the bottom to 
the top, sothis play was good both because white had to 
protect its undebelly, so you got sente, and also, the 
top-left corner was white's largest area.];W[cf];B[ec];W[hq]

(;B[ho]C[This move is not very good. Generally, it's best to block 
from the corner first, then the side, and then finally the 
center.];W[kq];B[mq];W[ko]
(;B[bp]C[romain: maybe too passive? as it's open on other side? 
but it was also to threaten left side invasion.
I don't think this was the best move. I would prefer 
something like this. (see variation)];W[mo];B[qo];W[fn];B[gr]
LB[gq:A]C[Simply A is better.];W[qf]LB[qh:A]C[Perhaps A would be better. With that continuation, you 
would gain more influence in the center and on the right 
side, with which you could attack white bottom group 
more easily.]
(;B[nc];W[rd];B[qg];W[pg];B[qh];W[pe]
(;B[rf]TR[rd]C[romain: here i made a mistake i think, kind of "i play 
automatic but woops, he did not follow same joseki as i 
did..."
r16 instead?

This move does seem good, but it lacks the ability to 
threaten to seperate white's stone unless she responds.];W[qd]
;B[pc];W[lc];B[re];W[qe];B[rb]MA[of][kc]LB[jd:A][le:B][ne:C]
C[slow? O15 better? or M16?

I would prefer to escape rather than live in the corner 
since its so small. I would reccommend playing A first. 
White would respond at or around B, and then black 
would responds with C. Now, black has the option of 
attacking one of white's groups (starting perhaps with the 
marked spots) depending on which group white tries to 
save first.];W[ph];B[qi];W[gc]LB[fd:A]C[A is absolutely necessary.]

(;B[bi]MA[jj]C[i was kind of afraid he could have killed later, so i played 
this to be 99% sure of my life (well i admit, i thought 100% 
during the game). Was that needed? i just gave him such 
a perfect wall ...

This move is not needed, but I can see why you worries - 
the tsumego is not the easiest to solve.
As for the wall, normally is would be good, but your 
marked stone  limits its purpose; he should not let you 
have gotten so much for nothing.];W[fq]LB[gq:A]C[Hamete, A captures the stone.]

(;B[eq];W[gq];B[fr];W[go];B[pi];W[mj];B[ni]LB[jh:A]C[Horribly passive - this move does little. It's very important 
to make your tengen stone live. Running with A is optimal.]

maybe it is something to keep for later?he'd have so much 
threats with , but if i can invade he's moyo enough, maybe 
that's worth it?

I think that in this case, black can get a ko, but I prefer 
the other variation since black will lose less if he loses this 
ko.]
(;B[nm]MA[nj][mo]LB[pl:A]C[Due to these stones, trying to enclose territory with this 
move is pointless. it also does not to invade because 
white's two groups are close and strong enough be 
invaded. I think a more passive A is better as white 
cannot fix this gap while making black's shape worse.];W[nn]

(;B[gb];W[lr]C[this move made me look after why he did play that after 
the game, then i found a ko (i may be wrong though), 
tryed to show the variation on the move before. well it was 
a bit complicated for my reading.

I agree, theko is not very easy to find, but there is one.]

yose there, but maybe ,not as big as A4? thoose seemed 
kind of miai to me, but one must be bigger...

This is why yose can be tricky. Both corners look big, but 
not only are they surprisingly small, the bottom is worth 
quite a bit more than the top.];W[ap];B[bq];W[nd];B[od];W[on]

You played a very good game, though I can see what you 
meant about this being a very peaceful game. While 
being territorial player isn't bad, I think you should work on 
playing more severe and perhaps risky moves. Someone 
once told me "Don't try to play peaceful games. Not only 
do they not respresent a pro's game, you don't have to 
read as much. Playing fighting games are much better - 
you're required to read out far to win and thus you 
improve."])
