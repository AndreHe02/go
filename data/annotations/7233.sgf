C[Hallo and thx for reviewing my game :)!

Please review for black (which I played) and ONLY the Fuseki (till about move 60), because I felt I may have sucked in Fuseki and I wanna focusing on that. Games like that occur quite often and my basic questions always are:

1. Do I play too much for territory and give my opponent too much of a moyo?

2. How and where do I invade/reduce a moyo?

I'm a more territorial-playing-player, just that you know that I prefer that style...it's just the question if I prefer it too much :).

JS: Hi, I am JÃ¼rgen Suntinger 3d from Austria (KGS Nick: Juergonaut) and hope to help you improve your fuseki. If you have any further questions do not hesitate to contact me on KGS :-).]

C[JS: So far everything developed naturally.]
(;W[cl];B[cq]TR[jq]C[JS: Going for territory here is just natural for black because white's marked stone is low.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[em]LB[jq:A]TR[cl][do][dp][dq]C[JS: White made a big mistake in point of view of fuseki. She built up a wall making some kind of framework in the center, but white cannot be happy because the stone at A is on the 3rd line. 3rd line means the stone is low and can very easily be pressed down or be reduced. On the other hand black got territory in the corner and sente. Strong players would already favour black in this position.

At this point it is important to keep your mind free from greed. If you want to get a better understanding of the game you have to know that only a small margin of points is necessary to win. Black currently has a little advantage in terms of territory but white has some kind of thickness in the center. The important point now is to keep the balance. The balance of territory and thickness.]

(;B[fc]C[JS: This is a good point for black and cannot be criticised, however look at the variation.]
;W[id]
(;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed]
(;B[fb]C[JS: This move is probably a little bit slow. I give you two joseki choices in the variations, the important point is to leave weak points in the white's shape which can be used afterwards!]
;W[ge]
(;B[lq];W[jo]LB[jo:A][nq:B]C[JS: You have strengthened white at A which some kind of gave the white's moyo some shape, but still left some kind of bad aji around B so, look at the variation two moves ago

However, black sure has still some kind of advantage in terms of territory so your main goal in this game now is to keep the white moyo restricted. So you should not give your opponent the chance to close it off.]

(;B[mc];W[qj];B[ql];W[qf]
(;B[qe];W[pf]C[rs220675: I don't know...should I feel bad here? I felt good because I had all 4 corners and I figured White's "Moyo" is still very well to invade...what do you think?

JS: I think that if this group can settle itself easily, then it will be hard to reduce/invade the white moyo. Instead of strenghtening white and take territory, you should think about keeping white weak and running together with him into his moyo.]
;B[qh]C[JS: Now it is to late to attack, your opponent will just sacrifice one stone to make a nice wall facing his moyo.]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[pi];B[rj];W[pj];B[rk];W[me]C[JS: Black made 10-12 points more on the right side, but the white moyo in the center got some kind of shape, it is hard to estimate such big moyos, but somehow white start to feel comfortable in this game.]

(;B[ip];W[jp];B[hn];W[hl]C[JS: This way the black stones should become very heavy and an easy target to attack, this just strenghtens white, even if she keeps 2/3 of her moyo she will have no problems contering you corners. Just by chance you got lucky in the comming fight, but still white was in no danger.

JS: Final Comment: Balance of territory/ thickness is a very important thing in Go, if you have a lot of territory you should always think about the strength of your opponents groups because nothing is for free.]

(;B[jj]C[JS: it is now hard for black to find a good move, I would try this one :-)]
))
(;B[qh]TR[mc]C[JS: Black should do something actively, he should use his stones to attack, not to just make simpleminded territory. 

The important thing is following: The worst thing what could happen to a big moyo is a weak group having to run into it :-).]
))
(;B[pj]C[JS: I would suggest this move to extend the black's territory and give white no good point to extend her moyo]
))
(;B[jo]TR[jq]C[JS: The reason white's wall is not so effective is because the marked stone is restricted in its movement when black presses from the top. This move also restricts the development of the white moyo in the center which is very important in terms of balance.]

(;B[fe];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[ib]C[JS: Although this joseki is a little bit out of fashion it is sometimes considered when erasing some moyo of the opponent]
))
(;B[jd]C[JS: It is easy to think of just extending the black framework while erasing the white one. This kind of move makes it hard for white to find a good continuation and gives her no chance to make use of his wall on the lower side directly. This way black does not get into a low position and white has nothing to attack with the wall on the bottom.]
))
(;W[fp]LB[nc:A]TR[jq]C[JS: It is probably more consistant for white to just extend because the marked stone is optimally placed. White will probably get sente and can take the next big point e.g. at A]
