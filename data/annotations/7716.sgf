C[Hello and thank you in advance for the review!

Further on I will add some questions/comments in key points when I didn't know what was going on or what I sould have done.]
;B[qd]C[juggal [10k\]: hi! have a nice game!];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd]
;B[oc];W[qj]C[Was this too early? Did I have bigger moves?

This is perfectly normal.

You may want to put c16 at d17 so that you are not mirroring black's moves (and force him to approach you on the inside too).]
;B[ql]C[Black usually approaches from the other side.];W[qg]
;B[ol];W[cj]C[Same question with this move.

Here, I would play E16 and complete the last corner.  (And then if black lets you, you'd play D10 to complete your side).

Generally, completing an unbalanced corner (i.e. not a 3-3 or 4-4) is a big move.]
;B[ed];W[df]C[Probably you don't want to rely on this joseki much since it usually ends in your gote.  Typically, pinching or tsuke (either side) is preferable.

Here pinch if you like to complicate things (g17 or h17), or else try the low tsuke (e17) which is simple (but it gives you both big sides...]
;B[db]C[This looks like a misclick, tsuke is definitely the response -- here black is playing on the 2nd line for no reason.]
;W[jq]C[here you are creating a double wing, which is good,
but it's low on both sides which is only OK.  You might want to consider instead approaching at o3 first, then drawing back at k4 so that you can have one side high.

It's possible you might get pinched, but in that case, you can go into black's corner.]
;B[bc]C[White tenuki's?  Response is ok too.];W[bd];B[cc];W[em]
C[If you want to grow this area, consider K5, O3, D10 K10 or D3 or C4, probably in that order.

This grows but your stones seem a bit haphazardly placed.];B[dd]
;W[cf];B[nq];W[jc]C[a good idea.  if r13 was stronger you can n17 directly.]
;B[hc];W[mc];B[fq];W[hq]C[kicking first when you have a stone on the K line or closer, is generally a good idea.  it makes your opponent heavy]
;B[fo];W[gn]C[At this point I wanted to threat to capture and get influence and to try and connect my K3 group.
was this the right way?

OK, so here I'd have to say it's a good move to try to use your e7 stone.

however, outside influence shouldn't be valued too much since you already have to compete with black's p8 stone.  but still you have few high stones yourself (so black could make a big center if you have no influence).

what i'm saying is, don't trade a *big* corner for influence on this board -- it's late in the game and your opponent can already compete for it.

second, your opponent can still dive into the corner, so you won't be capturing him completely -- so be careful.

I was considering just E2 here instead and letting him run out.]
;B[dr];W[cq]C[this exchange is probably very bad for black.

you generally do not want to slide if you've also been pinched.  this is because now you only get 1 to 1.5 eyes (i.e. *not two*) and you have removed the corner invasion.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[fp];W[eq]C[Bad move I guess.

losing the liberty means you will have to go back and fix the cut, otherwise black will get that big corner i mentioned earlier.]
;B[er];W[ho];B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[do];B[bq];W[ji]C[What do you think about this move?

Something in the center seems good.  You could try leaning on h17 (with h16) first and try to build up both sides.]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[iq];W[ir]C[correct way to handle that?

yeah because you can g2 in sente, you are completely connected (or else black has to give up 3 stones himself).]
;B[jp];W[kq];B[kp];W[gr];B[fr];W[fi]C[you may want to walk him once more (big points wise) or hane, which is even better to make him run towards your center stone.]
;B[lq];W[km];B[pj];W[pk]C[Tesuji / overmove / just bad?

black's move is poor form, should be q11 or 12, or for an alternate idea he could play s12 or 11 (but here on top better since you already have friends in the center to run to).

as for your response you have to ask what is it you want?  do you just want q11 for stability?  if so, why not just play that?  i imagine black will play q9 now, so if you rearrange the moves would you play q11 now black plays p10, and *then* you play q9 and give black r9?]
;B[qk];W[pi];B[oj]C[yep, see you could have q11 without losing the q9 stone, *and* without losing a critical liberty on r10.]
;W[ok]C[tsk tsk, this is a net!

so again if what you want is p11, just play that directly instead!]
;B[nk];W[oi];B[nj];W[rj]C[so instead of these exchange moves of q9 and p9, you could have q11 and then probably just tenuki (or else add another move such as p13)  but instead now black has your stones and a super influence.]
;B[li]C[too timid!

black should play something like k9 now];W[lo];B[lp];W[ln]C[n7 is better shape]
;B[pf];W[re]C[a good exchange for you, black should play low instead]
;B[rd];W[qe];B[pe];W[qf];B[pg];W[qh]C[you should tenuki, if black played r12 you can s12.]
;B[md];W[ld];B[me];W[le]C[more good exchanges for you.  here black already has his nose in the center, so he should consider coming in below to take away territory.  making 2 points each for these moves is costly since he spent as many moves earlier  too (so really just 1 point a move!)]
;B[mf];W[lf];B[jd];W[id];B[ic];W[je];B[hd]C[sometimes you should connect, sometimes you should take.

generally you take when you think you don't need the eye at the k16 stone, and two the value of the other atari (k18 here) is very high.

you generally connect when you need the eye and otherwise don't mind getting atari'd from the other side at k18.

so here, i would say take!];W[ie];B[he];W[hf];B[ef];W[ff]C[what about this? I just wanted to make a capture threat then connect

you can't just play a move without reading it out a bit.

this clamp you must consider two moves at the least, what if black connects and what if he extends?  connect is easy you will just play e13 and be fine.

but if he extends himself?  then you must play e15 (so you see the two moves are miai) then he has an atari at f15, you connect, then he can atari you again at g14, you must extend, and then he can push again. at g13. then you'd have to extend once more.

so the net effect is that he can push through, but only on the smaller side.  so this move is ok.

however, what if you just hane?  then maybe black will hane at g14 and you will want to hane again.  you'd want to compare that too.  (i think the clamp here though, works out fine).]
;B[eg];W[ee];B[fe];W[de];B[gf];W[fg];B[gg];W[fh];B[hg]C[now you should just k13 and try to stay connected.]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[jh];B[if];W[ii]C[playing j11 is very big but have to be careful to keep upper group alive.]
;B[jg];W[hh];B[ig];W[lg];B[gh]C[G11 would be better?

No, just playi g11 now.  can even play h11 though your shape is a little uglier]
;W[hi];B[gi];W[gj];B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[kh]C[good idea. you can make one eye on top (if black ignores m18), but black has l15 to kill your other eye. (now that j14 is in place).  so this is a big win for white.]
;B[kk];W[il]C[maybe kosumi at k8 is better?];B[ik];W[hk];B[ij]
;W[hj];B[jl];W[lj]C[again.. tesuji / overmove / just bad?

probably just bad! you need to save the m6 stones, and there doesnt seem to be a way to capture the j9 stones right now.]
;B[kj];W[mi];B[mj];W[lh];B[ki]C[realized M5 was in danger, was lucky that my opponent didn't notice

yes black shouldn't really reply at all on this side, he should just play k7.]
;W[im];B[jm];W[jn];B[in];W[kl]C[nice spot!

since black replied you ended up reducing his liberties so that he could not push!]
;B[lk];W[jk];B[jj]C[another big exchange for white.

definitely a cool down point, so consider your big yose moves.

there is o18, t16, t7, m2, o6, b5 and a17.

as a gut feeling you'd go with b5 since that's your largest area and black cand play b6 to reduce it by over ten points.

after that a17 is double sente, t16 is sente, m2 is sente (for black) and t7 is sente.  o18 is probably sente too.

of those o18 and t7 are probably the biggest -- i'd start with t7 first then o18, then go to the double sente (if black lets you, it's kinda small on his side so it's more likely he can play it than you).]
;W[io]C[Don't know why I thought this was important.

Either O6/P6 reduction or defend at B5 seems more effective]
;B[ni]C[
well you are lucky black decided to play a kinda pointless  move too.]
;W[mh]C[oh no!];B[nh]C[oh good!];W[bo]C[phew.

ok you both went for coffee it seems.  luckily you got back to the board first :P .]
;B[mo]C[black should consider o6 instead.];W[nm]C[just hane is fine.]
;B[om];W[nn]C[t];B[no];W[on];B[pn];W[oo];B[op];W[po];B[qo];W[nl]
;B[pl];W[fn]C[small, black can only push once, if he jumps you can wedge.]
;B[lb];W[lc];B[nc];W[mb];B[nb]C[later m19 is worth something like 6 points.]
;W[rl]C[monkey jump is better here still.  now that r6 atari is there, you could probe him first since there is alot of aji]
;B[rk];W[sk];B[rm];W[sl];B[sm];W[sj];B[ao];W[an];B[ap];W[bm]
;B[ad];W[be];B[ae];W[af];B[ac]C[here black should not have pushed again but rather take initative elsewhere.]
;W[dh]C[probably not needed. but if you think you are ahead making a safe move is smart if you are unsure.]
;B[kr];W[jr];B[ks]C[another bad sequence for black, just m2 is sufficient, playing l1 was also a mistake should just be m2 again.]
;W[js];B[lr];W[gs]C[g1 is pretty small, t16 and m19 are still on the board.]
;B[fs]C[but black follows you around!];W[oh];B[og];W[eo];B[ph]
;W[qi];B[mn];W[mm];B[ml];W[lm];B[jf];W[ke];B[mg];W[ll];B[se]
;W[sf];B[sd];W[rg];B[gq];W[sh]C[I know unnecessary.];B[jo];W[ko]
;B[mk];W[qn]C[So without this invasion I would have lost big time]
;B[pm];W[qp];B[ro];W[rp];B[rn];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[sp]C[lucky again.]
;W[qq];B[sq];W[sr];B[so];W[or];B[nr];W[pq];B[ps];W[oq];B[os]
C[and again];W[np];B[mp];W[ms]C[mistimed];B[mr];W[op]C[nooooo, o1 and you kill everything!]
;B[ns];W[qs]C[so many black mistakes there...];B[fj];W[fk];B[ej]
