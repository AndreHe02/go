;C[H - Thank you for reviewing the game... I felt a bit behind the whole game, and indeed I lost by a few points.  I'm not quite sure where I need to improve, I would welcome your opinion of where I should focus my attention.]
;B[dc];W[pp];B[cp];W[de];B[pc];W[ec]C[H - This move made me feel like my move in the right corner was a mistake.

reid: no, Q17 is a fine response to D15.  The general rule is take and attack corners first, then sides, then the center.  D15 attacks a corner and Q17 takes one, so they are about the same value at this time.]
;B[eb];W[ed];B[fb];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[bb]LB[ic:A]C[reid:  B18 seems to be gote for both sides (if white B18, b B19).  Building up the side with A looks bigger.  Black has 4 of 7 moves on the second line.  Not good this early in the game.]
;W[pe]C[reid: White should extend along the left side to stabilize the upper left group.]
;B[nd]C[reid:  You should always be looking to make the stones you play work with all the stones that are already on the board.  This move (O16) doesn't have a good relation with F18 - there is no black moyo on the upper side.  Perhaps black should think about a pincer attack here instead.]
;W[pj]C[reid: this is not a joseki move.  black should be able to take advantage of it, but what's the best way?]
;B[pg]LB[qd:C][qe:B][of:D][qg:E][ch:A]C[reid: this seems like a reasonable starting place locally, but if I were black, I'd want to attack the larger (and heavier) group in the upper left (white has neglected to extend along the left side).

Something around A looks like it might be interesting.  Test white's response, and leave the attack around Q13 for later.  Depending on the result of the upper left fighting, black may want to handle the Q15 stone differently.

Another way to look at this: there are lots if different ways to respond in the upper right corner, including at least B through E as well as Q13.  But in the upper left, A is really the only spot.  So since we don't know what's best in the upper right, play the area where we know what needs to be done.]
;W[ne];B[qd]LB[qe:A]C[reid: with this move, black is abandoning the attacking stone at Q13 - white is sure to respond with A.  You want to avoid helping your opponent like this.]
;W[qe];B[md];W[od];B[oc];W[qh]LB[ld:B][le:C][me:A][oh:D]C[reid: wrong idea for white here.  White needs to catch the black stone on a large scale.  More like white A, black B or C, white D.]
;B[of]C[reid:  Since white played R12, black can simply let Q13 sit there - no need to put it into play right away.  Again, attacking the upper left looks like the most urgent place.

It may turn out that later white wants to turn at A, for example.  If so, the exchange of P14 for P15 is bad.  A bad exchange like this is called "aji-keshi".  It means literally "erasing the taste".  At this stage of your go development, one of the most important things you need to learn is to avoid aji-keshi at all costs.  It's a very difficult lesson - we learn early on that sente is good.  But now it's time to learn that not all sente is good.]
;W[oe];B[qg]C[reid:  Black splits white here, but it's gote.  Since white is out ahead of black, it's really more like black is under attack by white.  This is where black starts to fall behind.  This is why it's often better to leave stones like Q13 until later in the game to see how things develop.]
;W[mf];B[nh];W[mh];B[ni];W[ok];B[rh];W[qi];B[ri];W[rf]C[reid: white probably thinks this is sente, but black cleverly plays R10 before connecting.

White should simply play S10 here.  If black then plays S14, white's natural response at S15 is painful for black.]
;B[qj];W[qk];B[rj];W[pi];B[rg];W[rk];B[pl];W[pk];B[mi];W[lh]
;B[li];W[kh];B[dj]LB[jh:B][ki:A]C[reid:  OK, this is something that black can work on changing:  amateur players, and weaker players in particular, have a tendency to think "that group can live, so I'll take a big point now".

But the proverb says "take the urgent point, not the big point.  This is a good example.  D10 is big, no doubt.  But the O11 group is not settled - it's a target for attack (T13 is one sente eye, but white's response at S16 does terrible damage to the corner).  White can probably make the next 10 moves in sente with moves that attack the O11 group.  Black has no recourse but to respond submissively, trying to eke out a life.  Those ten free moves are much more valuable than black's single D10 move.

So remember the proverb, and make those groups safe before you play away.  In this case, black can keep pushing at A because N16 and F18 negate any value white gets from B, etc.]
;W[jj];B[lk];W[nl]LB[jl:A][kl:B][qm:C]C[reid:  I think A or B would be a better continuation for this attack.  White should not fear black connecting his Q8 stone - he can still connect under with something around C.]
;B[cg]C[reid:  Good attack, but it would have been even more effective before white got all the center influence with L12, etc.]
;W[dl]C[reid:  I guess white doesn't think there's any danger here.]
;B[cm]C[reid:  Here's another habit to work on breaking:  In go, if you try to do something and fail, the result is usually worse than not trying in the first place.

C7 looks like it's trying to connect to D10.  But white's natural response at C8 makes for a nice splitting attack.  Black fails to connect, and instead, helps white.

Black should instead continue the attack on the D16 group.  Once C13 and D10 become stronger, then black can think about mounting a counter-attack against D8.  Connection should never be in the picture at all (because it cannot work).]
;W[cl];B[dm]C[reid: black continues to help white.];W[el];B[fj]
;W[eg]C[reid: all of a sudden, it's too late to attack the natural target.  Instead, black is under attack.  Black's only compensation is the small territory between C7 and C4 - perhaps 4 to 6 points.]
;B[hj];W[jl];B[lm]C[reid: black would like to attack the three stones at E8, but the Q13 group is too weak.

Black has two weak groups on the board.  I usually think I have the game won when my opponent has two weak groups.  It's just a question of working the weaknesses against each other to wrap up the game.]
;W[gl];B[dg];W[eh];B[ci];W[em]C[reid: White loses focus here.  Continuing the attack with perhaps A (looking for a nice center territory) looks more severe.]
;B[do]C[reid: black should tenuki.  E7 is too small a threat.  Black should take this opportunity to try to settle one of those weak groups.]
;W[eq]C[reid: Again, not the right focus.  And after D5, this E3 is too close anyway.  It gives black a chance to complicate things.]
;B[fp]C[reid: I think this is a good idea - try to split this new stone from the rather weak G8 group - maybe black can catch something.

Something I've noticed about amatuer games: they are often more complicated than pro games, largely because we leave so many things hanging that a pro would never leave.  This game is a good example.  There are so many undecided issues here that the game can swing back and forth with each move.  The moral is it's better to keep things simpler so you can understand what's going on :-)]
;W[fq];B[gp];W[cq];B[bq];W[br];B[gq]LB[bp:B][aq:D][dq:E][ar:A]
[cr:C][er:F]C[reid: Oops - now black loses focus.  If white lives in the corner, black won't be able to continue strengthening the outside.

How about black A instead?  If white B, black C, white D, black E leads to a nice ko for black.  If white connects the ko, black F takes two stones and the others are still in trouble.

If white C in response to white A, then black can connect at B and white still has to live - black can continue to strengthen the outside.]
;W[bp];B[dq];W[cr];B[dr];W[co]LB[ep:A][aq:B]C[reid: now it's white's turn for aji-keshi.  If white leaves this unplayed, he may get to pull out with A later.  White should simply live with B.]
;B[dp];W[bn];B[cn]LB[bm:A]C[reid: Ouch - bad shape.  Of course white will play A.  Which is where black should have played.]
;W[bm];B[bo];W[aq];B[ao];W[ap];B[bk];W[an];B[co];W[bl]C[reid: now white has a gote eye here if he needs it.]
;B[ef];W[ff];B[df];W[fe];B[gd];W[bf]C[reid: A simple rule in go: you cannot attack if you are not strong.  Black's F10 group is not strong enough to attack the white F14 group.]
;B[bg];W[jd]LB[fg:B][hh:A]C[reid: of course, the white stones are not entirely invulnerable.  White might want to play at A first to protect the cut at B and to continue attacking the black group.]
;B[he];W[hg];B[ig];W[ih];B[hh];W[gh];B[hi];W[if];B[jg];W[hf]
;B[jh];W[kf];B[ji];W[ki];B[kj];W[kk];B[lj];W[ll];B[ml];W[kl]
;B[mm];W[mk]C[reid: ouch.  That's a big loss - more than 45 points.]
;B[ik];W[jk];B[il];W[jn];B[lo]LB[im:A]C[reid: Big mistake here.  Black must play at A first.  The three black stones to the right are much smaller that the 9 white stones to the left.]
;W[im];B[hm];W[ij];B[hk]LB[in:A]C[reid: ouch again.  Giving up the four K13 stones is extremely painful.  In any case, black should atari at A.  This becomes significant in a moment.]
;W[hn]LB[jm:B][gn:C][in:A]C[reid: if black had exchanged A for B first, atari at C next would be possible.]
;B[gm];W[ii];B[jm];W[km];B[kn];W[jm];B[jo];W[in];B[gn];W[jf]
;B[ho];W[kg];B[oq]C[reid: Now white has awful shape, and we've got large captures on both sides.  White's capture on the right is about 15 points larger than black's to the left (including the r K13 stones)  Black has the upper right corner and the lower side though, so black should be ahead.]
;W[ej]C[H - I was unprepared for this of course.

reid: Heh, that's what go is all about.  Your opponent's job is to make your life miserable :-)]
;B[ek]LB[ei:A]C[...So I played the wrong move...

reid: Yeah.  Looks like A works better.];W[dk];B[ei];W[bj];B[ak]
C[reid: Is there a better way for black here?  Perhaps I should present this as a life and death problem?  Try to solve it before looking at the variation.]

(;W[al];B[cj];W[ck];B[bi];W[aj]C[... and W lived :(];B[pq]C[reid: Well, at least there's some compensation here.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[on];B[op];W[pn];B[rd];W[re];B[kc];W[jc];B[nf]
;W[me];B[ph]C[reid: Q12 and the previous move (O14) are both giveaways.  Black has only one gote eye for this group now, so he needs a sente eye here to live.  Not gonna happen.  Sadly, the exchange of O14 for N15 is probably enough to lose the game for black.  Not only is it about three points difference, but it also takes a liberty from the N16 stones.  That becomes critical later.]
;W[oi];B[nm];W[ol];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qn];B[fl]C[reid: this is a smaller than responding to K17 and keeping the upper right side.]
;W[fm];B[fk];W[kp];B[io];W[mp];B[no];W[nr];B[kr];W[ko];B[ln]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[jr];B[jq];W[lr];B[kq];W[lq];B[or];W[np];B[oo]
;W[ks];B[ir]C[H - I felt this unsuccessful invasion gained me a few points.

reid: A few, but they were mostly yours already.

But you are leaving some bad aji behind.  Instead of J2, you could simply extend to J3 and eliminate any chance of aji here.  Or you could tenuki and keep the top side with L18.]
;W[lc];B[ld]LB[mb:A]C[reid: A is better shape, and looks a bit bigger.]
;W[kb];B[hb];W[mb];B[nb];W[rc];B[rb]LB[qc:B][pd:C][sd:A]C[reid: Why not just descend to A?  If white B, black C.  Black has a lot of outside liberties, so he should be able to kill the white stones first.]
;W[sd];B[qc];W[sb]C[reid: Oops - black didn't want to see this ko.]
;B[sc];W[iq];B[se];W[jp];B[sf]C[H - And again, I felt I gained here.

reid: If you count it, it's really only about 4 points difference.  Not enough to catch up (you were about 10 points behind before the trade).]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[bc];B[ab]LB[ac:A]C[reid: why not hane at A here?  It's not a life and death question, so you should hane to remove the 1/2 point possibility of your opponent getting A17 in gote later.  A18 and A17 are both gote for black anyway.]
;W[eo];B[ep];W[fo];B[go];W[ib];B[hc];W[fc];B[ac];W[be]C[reid: yeah, A17 after A18 isn't sente - taking with B15 would have been bigger.]
;B[nj];W[nk];B[sg]LB[ng:B][sk:A]C[reid: Eh?  What's the purpose of this move?  If you get an eye out here, you'll never need to play at T13.  So you should instead be thinking about A and B.]
;W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[qs]LB[os:A]C[reid: again, a point loss.  Black A is a live shape in the corner.  After all the outside liberties you need one more to keep it from turning into seki, but with a liberty, you're still OK.  Now, if white gets A, black loses a point.]
;W[oh];B[ng];W[ad];B[kd];W[ie];B[om];W[pm];B[sk];W[sl];B[sj]
;W[ql];B[nq];W[mr];B[hq];W[is];B[po];W[qo];B[dh];W[ge];B[hd]
;W[ke];B[ha];W[ia];B[ma];W[la];B[na];W[cf];B[af];W[ae];B[ag]
;W[dd];B[db];W[le];B[nc];W[gi];B[fh];W[fg];B[fi];W[gj];B[gk]
;W[gg];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds];W[gs];B[fs];W[hs];B[ns];W[ms];B[os]
;W[mg];B[ai];W[gc];B[gb];W[ic];B[ip];W[lp];B[og];W[lb];B[oj]
;W[en];C[H - ... But I lost by 3.5.  What should I have done?

reid: I think there are several things you can take away from this game.  The most important are:  1) play the urgent move, not the big move, and 2) learn to recognize and avoid aji-keshi - don't help your opponent.

And finally, in the final analysis, it all comes down to fighting.  There were some reading mistakes here that would have changed the whole game had they been played differently.  Reading ability is best excercised with life-and-death problems.  One final proverb: if you want to get strong at go, study life and death.]

(;AE[ak]C[There's not much space here, so black should still be able to prevent white from getting two eyes.]
PL[B];B[al]C[Here's the key point for both sides.  Can white make two eyes now?]
