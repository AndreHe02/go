AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello ,
I'm Thierry
The game is play in real and in the same time register in SGF file .

PLayers :
Toon (21 kyu) vs Thierry (25 Kyu) .

This game is play with a 4 stones handicap .

The result was B +25.5];W[qf];B[nd]C[Considering that Black has control of so much of the board already I beleive this move is too conservative.]
;W[qd]C[White is at a severe disadvantage because of the handicap and so this move should have been much more aggressive.]
;B[pc];W[qc];B[qb]C[A poor move by black, it could be giving away sente (control) in the following exchange:]

(;W[pe]C[Another move that should have been much more ambitious. White needs to reinforce the right side.]
;B[oe];W[of]C[A good move.];B[ne];W[nf];B[jd]C[This is what black needs to be doing. Fencing in the territory he gained with the handicap.]
;W[qn]C[White should have done this at the beginning instead of the battle in the upper right corner. The knights move attack is a very good attack against star points.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[np]C[A two space jump might have been better.]
;W[oo];B[op];W[no];B[jp]C[is it the good way to secure this part ? N5 or L3 beter ?

N5 would not have been better because it is weaker shape. This move is a solid one, but you might want to consider the K3 point. It leaves less room below and is much easier to secure.]
;W[cn]C[White makes very good use of the knights move.];B[co]
;W[mp]C[White should be getting more territory at this point, not just eating away a little of blacks.]
;B[mq]C[Good move in this situation.];W[me]C[This move serves little purpose at this stage in the game. White should concentrate on stronger shapes.]
;B[md];W[lc]C[B is perhaps a good sequence ? What do you think 

This is actually a poor invasion for white. He might have tried invading at K17 or another point to the left where black is not nearly as strong and there is more available territory.]

(;B[mc]
(;W[mb]C[This is a bad move for white, it has nowhere to go in that direction. A better alternative is to move to the other side where black is weaker.]
;B[nb];W[kb];B[jb];W[ld];B[le];W[mf];B[ke]C[is it possible to save the group O16 ?

It is possible by playing the P17 point, this makes two eyes easily attainable. Black should have sacrificed the stone at M15.]
;W[oc]C[White now makes two eyes more difficult but black can still stay alive.]

(;B[od]C[This killed black.];W[pb]C[B is beter ?]
(;B[gd]C[Solid move.];W[lp];B[lq];W[jo]C[Good move for white.]
;B[io];W[kp]
(;B[ko]C[Bad move for black, might be better to play K3.];W[jn]
;B[in];W[ip];B[jq];W[kq];B[kr];W[iq];B[jr]C[Black played right into white's hands, try "reading ahead" this is when you attempt to predict plays. You should predict 2 to 3 moves into the future when you can.]
;W[ir];B[gq];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[fq]C[Good moves for black. Solid shape. But black needs to be more offensive, the left side and upper left corner are up for grabs, black should strengthen them.]
;W[gp];B[cq]C[Not entirely necessary right now, black needs to be taking more territory.]
;W[im];B[jm];W[kn];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[km];B[jl];W[hn]C[B is beter ?]

(;B[lm];W[ho];B[kl]C[A decent result for black, but he must quickly make space for two eyes.]
;W[in];B[hq];W[hp];B[ll];W[do];B[dn];W[eo];B[cm]C[Good move.]
;W[dm];B[bn];W[en];B[cn];W[dl];B[dj]C[Maybe C10 would be better but this is exactly what black needs to be doing.]
;W[dk];B[ck]C[Poor move, it is weak. Black should play like D13 or C12 not this, white can pick it apart with its stronger D7 chain.]
;W[cl];B[cj]C[Good decision to not attempt to defend at B8.]
;W[jc]
(;B[lb]C[very bad];W[la];B[ib]C[Bad move, H17 is better, less territory and you may abandon a stone or two but it is stronger.]

;W[eg];B[df]C[Good move.];W[ef];B[ig];W[fe];B[fd];W[ge];B[ee]
C[Bad move, white cannot steal much territory there, and black is in danger of losing the chains in the middle, it should link up at M14 soon, there are ways to survive without this, but it would make it much more difficult.]

;W[pq];B[pr];W[oq];B[or]C[Over all it was a good game, both players need to try reading ahead. Black should read a book on openings, I suggest "In the Beginning." Also further reading might include "Tesuji" from the same series. Keep playing Go and good luck!]
