AB[dp][pd]C[wornof: Hi, I'm black, and requested the review. I dont think I did that badly here, but his moves seemed generally more efficient and he was always chasing me whilst getting territory. Thanks!
This game was played on KGS.];W[pp];B[cd]C[wornof: This seemed reasonable to me, corners are good! Would it be better to put some pressure on white, though?

*** No, taking the corner is never wrong. If White had played on the 3-4 point, an approach here would be worth considering, but the 4-4 point is hard to attack.]
;W[qf];B[qe]C[wornof [14k\]: Hi

wornof:I was aiming to take some territory in the corner, though he was too canny to let me get as much as I'd have liked. Also puts pressure on him, but should I not touch a weak stone?

*** Yes, better not touch a weak stone. I do not like this joseki too much, because it settles the groups very early. White can be happy about this, as it balances well with his corner stone on Q4.
If you are afraid to play a pincer against a stronger player, just play O17 or O16 which assures you the corner and leaves some potential for attacking white on the right side.]
;W[pf]
(;B[rf]C[*** This is not joseki (see variation)];W[rg];B[re]
;W[qh];B[oe];W[mc]C[wornof: Here he jumps in.

*** sure, because he knows that you missed this in the joseki. P15 is slow and too far from the edge.

The exchange S14-S13-S15-R12 gives White thickness and influence, where black gains only little.]

(;B[nc]C[wornof: I defend to try and put pressure on and take as much territory as I can, but again this doesnt look stable.

*** Again: the contact strengthens the weak white stone. Why not play one further to the right (P17)?]
;W[nd];B[oc];W[jc];B[ec]C[*** this is fine.];W[ql]C[*** I would have played R6 here. R8 is too close the upper right wall and to far from the corner stone.]

(;B[ci]C[*** looks a little bit timid. C10 is usual, because it works better together with the corner stone (D4). C11 is too far away.]
;W[fq];B[eq]C[wornof: Same as before, for lack of any better ideas.

*** I understand this. However here a pincer would be nice. See variation.]
;W[fp]
(;B[er]C[*** you should really follow the joseki here. Especially in handicap games, it is white who wants to deviate from the joseki, because the joseki gives a fair result for both parties. This way white cannot win.]
;W[fr];B[eo]C[****obviuosly black likes the result on the top right corner. I do not. E5 is just like P15. It does not attack nor does it make territory.]
;W[cn];B[co]C[*** now C5 is okay.];W[bo];B[bp];W[ck]
(;B[cf]C[*** this looks like a big mistake to me. There are many better ways to repsond to this, see variation.]
;W[bn];B[dn]C[*** Yes, mandatory];W[dm];B[em];W[dl]
(;B[fo]C[**** this move is questionable. White answer is obvious. Is the exchange favourable for black? I do not think so.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[hn];B[nq]C[wornof: I'd broken into the centre there, but was wary of doing nothing more than helping him down here. Was invasion right, and was this the right place?

**** The place looks ok for me, however the timing is not perfect: black should not strengthen the white wall (G5, H6) just before he invades.]
;W[lq]
(;B[pq]C[**** I think here black must invade on the 3-3 point.]
;W[qq];B[no];W[po]
(;B[op]C[**** when invading, light play is important. It is better here to attack the single white stone instead of protecting the Black stones which are an easy target for white.]
;W[lo];B[nm];W[gm]C[wornof: I decided to ignore this for now, since the other group looked more important.

Here, it can already be seen that he has strongly taken territory in J3 area and along the right. Is this just something to accept or what? I didnt seem to have anything in return for this.

**** It is the right decision to give up this stone. But it hurts.

J3 etc. is almost certain territory. You can only invade when you have support from the top. The right side is still fairly open. Black must stabilize its invading group and then he can launch an attack on R10, R6 and so on.]
;B[lr]C[*** fine];W[kr]
(;B[ls]C[*** horrible. What is your intention here?]
(;W[jr];B[fn];W[ho];B[lm]C[*** I think this is overplay. Blacks group is still far from being alive.]
;W[il]C[**** this is to protect the cut at H7. But I do not think this is urgent.]
;B[pm]C[**** It is a pitty, because now the chances to get into the right side vanish.]
;W[qm];B[pn];W[qn];B[mp]
(;W[lp]C[**** too passive from white.]
(;B[of]C[*** This move is like F5. It helps white. Black earns nothing with it.

You should not worry too much about White's prospective territory. If you enlarge the upper left, you will have enough to decide the game in your favour.]
;W[og]
(;B[nf]C[**** This is slow and clumsy. Almost every other move is better.]
;W[pr]
(;B[oq]C[**** with P2 black could have started a Ko fight, which is worth considering.]
;W[or];B[nr];W[qr];B[oo];W[gc]C[wornof: Reasonably big move, I think. Should I have been doing that earlier?

***** yes, e.g. instead of O14. Black would then have played H17.]
;B[fb]C[**** This is not in the right spirit. Again: do not defend every single point. White settles too easily. When you cannot attack white, it is impossible to gain profit.]
;W[gb];B[fd]C[**** Try to avoid this kind of moves (=P15, =E5).]
;W[ge];B[fe];W[gf]
(;B[ff];W[gg];B[fg]C[wornof: I decided that this was working for me, so let it go, banking on invading the centre from one of my other groups


**** Yes, this gave you a good amount of safe territory.];W[fi]
;B[fh];W[gh];B[ei];W[fj]
(;B[gd]C[**** I guess that was not the best black could do.]
;W[hd]
(;B[he]C[wornof: Here, the centre looks like big points, so I invaded. But should I have? Looking at things again, we both had access to the centre and a move at R10 (very maybe, I dont really know what would happen there!) or maybe K6 could be good.

*** I do not see that K6 is going to work.

R10 needs preparation. O13 may look slow, but must be answered locally.

H15? I am interested to see what will happen...];W[ie];B[hf]

;W[mg];B[lj];W[li];B[ki];W[mj];B[ii]C[wornof: I make my second eye, but he was driving me, and there's some white-looking territory at P10. Could I have managed that better?]
;W[kj];B[ij]C[wornof: And here, J9 or H10 look just as good for taking that point, but also invading. Was I too conservative?

**** you were extremely lucky that your group became alive. It was important to make life sure here. H10 would have done it in a slightly more effective way. J9 is not as good, because white will atari. So white gets an extra stone to play here.]

(;B[md];W[lc]C[wornof: I make a mistake...];B[kb];W[lb]C[wornof: But he doesnt notice, luckily for me. This exchange might have gone better if I connected the L18 group? I'd probably not have captured O16, but would have been in his territory


**** You were really lucky.];B[me];W[jb];B[ln];W[kn];B[ml]C[*** This is too small. White should not answer here.]
;W[mk];B[ll]C[**** ?????];W[ok]C[wornof: Looking back at things, this looks like the bigger move. He solidifies a lot of territory there. Am I right?

*** the other move was everything but big, it was superfluous, a wasted move. If you see yourself making an empty triangle, look again and ask yourself if this is really a good move. Almost never an ampty triangle is a good move.]
;B[ol];W[pk]C[*** White says: "Thank you, I wanted to play here anyway."]
;B[pl]C[**** empty triangle. Need I to say more?];W[bj];B[bi]
;W[el];B[fm];W[fl];B[mo]C[**** you like empty triangles. Here it is at least worth something.]
;W[hm]
(;B[ap]C[**** Now this is endgame. Here it is important to keep the intitative. A4 is worth a lot, but unfortunately it is gote for black.]
;W[ai];B[ah];W[aj];B[cj]C[wornof: Luckily he defended the B9 point, but I'm not sure this counts as an attack! I immediately thought it was a mistake, yes? B12 nasty?

**** Again, you were lucky.];W[bl];B[bh];W[es];B[ds];W[fs];B[cr]

**** indeed, it was. Minus 1 Point.];W[ao];B[ep]C[**** this was a neutral point.]
;W[hi]C[*** this too.];B[ma];W[la];B[tt];W[tt]C[phalanx0 [12k\]: thanks for the game
wornof [14k\]: Good game, thank you

wornof: Right, that's it. Any help you can give me will be very, very much appreciated! I always seem to live with lots of small groups, which is exactly what happened again here, and obviously it didnt work. Thanks again!

**** I am glad if my comments help. All in all is was a balanced game. You should learn some Josekis and avoid unnecessary moves. This way you will be single digit kyu on kgs within a couple of weeks.
Basically you can say, that the game was decided in the end game.]
