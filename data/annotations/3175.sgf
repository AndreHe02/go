C[hishinobi [21k?\]: hello
mahumahu [22k?\]: Hi :)

hishinobi:  Hi, this is the first time asking for a review, so here goes!  I would appreciate comments on my opening moves or anything!  Thank you so much for reviewing this game for me.

Commented by Tomas 7kyu(kgs) as T:

C[mahumahu [22k?\]: Good game :)];W[pd]C[hishinobi [21k?\]: u too]
;B[dd];W[qp]C[mahumahu [22k?\]: thanks];B[oq];W[kc]C[T: This is not a common opening move but i definitly shouldn't worry about that yet,]
;B[lq];W[pn];B[ic];W[qj]C[T: I think this is too defensive. if b would play in that area, w can put pressure on it already without this move.]
;B[hp];W[ci]LB[fc:A][cf:B]C[hishinobi:  I was told this was a "weird" move.

T: It's not very bad but with b's response will force you to defend (as happened). This will give b a big influence in the corner for free.
I think w should play a bit more agressive for insteance at A or B]
;B[cg];W[cl];B[cn]C[T: As shown before, w is under pressure and this gives b a lot of corner-strength  for free]
;W[fj];B[qe];W[pe]LB[qd:A]C[A is better here. It takes a big corner and puts more pressure on b]
;B[qf];W[mn]LB[pg:A]C[T: This move is not  too important yet. A move at A could keep b sealed of.]
;B[ri]LB[pf:A]C[T: I think b has much more benefit playing at A now. Making small life should be the last choice if all else fails]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[qi];B[qg];W[pg];B[em];W[el];B[fl];W[fk];B[gl]
;W[eg];B[df];W[dg]LB[fc:B][rd:A][le:C]TR[em]C[T:The development of the ;last couple of moves are not good for w. w secured maybe ten points of territory while b has become much stronger in upper and lower regions.

b marked stone shuoldn't have scared w that much, since w is already quite safe.  w shouldn't have responded, and play another big point.

I point out some options:

A:Takes the corner in sente! after r16/r17 exchange and s15/s17 exchange. b needs to defend his group

B: double purpose. attacks j17 stone and aims at the corner.

C: secures territory at the top];B[mc];W[ke];B[ob];W[pb];B[oc]
;W[pc];B[kb]
(;W[me]TR[ld]C[T: This is gote, small and it leaves a cut at marked point. If you want to strengthen your stones, try m17 which is sente. 
It might also be effective here to try to cut (see variation)]
;B[jl];W[jo];B[jp];W[ko];B[kp];W[rj];B[si];W[sj];B[rg]
(;W[he]LB[sf:A]C[T: Too defensive. As the proverb says: There are no points in the centre! try g17 instead

Also b's defense wasn't good. I'm not sure but i think A kills !]

;B[jn];W[jm];B[kn];W[km];B[kl];W[ln];B[ip]LB[gn:A]C[T: very bad move by b. 1 point in gote, while g8 needs defending
If b plays A here. w will hardly get any points in the centre]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[fm];B[en];W[gn];B[fn];W[gm];B[go];W[hi]C[T: no need. b has nowhere to run to. If you want to attack ALWAYS attack at distance. This way you give b a chance to attack you.]

;B[ef];W[ei];B[fh];W[dk]C[T: you should definitly kill the three stones here with f14]
;B[ff];W[ll];B[lk];W[ij];B[kk];W[mk];B[lj];W[mj];B[li]C[T: these b moves need no answer. What is b trying to achieve?? Just take advantage of his move by playing elsewhere]
;W[mi];B[jh];W[lh];B[ml];W[lm];B[po];W[qo];B[pp];W[oo]C[T: R3 much bigger now. r3 takes the whole corner. This doesn;t really do anything]

;B[sp];W[so];B[sq];W[nl];B[ie]C[T: b's too aggresive here. w h16 to capture the stone]
;W[hf];B[if]
(;W[jg]C[hishinobi: White Move 138 was a mistake on my part.  Should Black have played H13 for the cut or did he make the right choice by playing J13?

T: No need to defend the cut (see variation) but h16 much bigger. (see other variation)]

LB[cc:A][rd:C][cq:B]C[T: no need. From here w plays a lot of useless moves. And that while A and B are still possible, both worth about 25 points! C also very big]
;B[nc];W[ng]C[T: ?? wasted move];B[qd];W[id];B[hd];W[jd];B[jc]

mahumahu [22k?\]: thanks well played
mahumahu [22k?\]: you make some quite strange moves but good game
hishinobi [22k?\]: strange moves?
hishinobi [22k?\]: i dunno
mahumahu [22k?\]: yes in the beginning...

hishinobi:  He says I play strange opening moves...  Any suggestions for better opening moves?

T: I don't think that is the biggest problem. Far too many times you play where the last move was played while it's useless. Learn the advantages of tenuki. 

Also you should try to become more agressive.  You had many chances to invade and playing something like g12 while there is still a 3x3 point to invade is not good.

In the opening you should try to give you;re stones a double purpose: attack some black stones, while aiming at territory on the other side (see B at move 34 for an example)


FInally remember the proverb: There's no territory in the centre.
You were quite lucky that b gave away the h8 group.])
