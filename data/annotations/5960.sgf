AB[pd][dp]C[To reviewer: Thanks for taking the time to review this game.  I've left some comments to try and reveal my thought process.  Once again, thanks.


hi!

Im only 1d kgs today
probably  am not always right 

if you have different opinion we can to come into discussion  about this question

english is not my native language
I hope you understand what i say

i am glad to get  a letter from you

(;B[cd];W[eb]
(;B[fc]C[I was trying to put pressure on the white group.  I now realise this was a terrible move.  Was it worth trying to attack the white group?]
;W[ed]C[natural continue];B[fd]C[this should be first!

f17 - is wrong, this move is a wasting time];W[ee]C[cutting 


very bad for black];B[df];W[fe];B[ge]MA[kc][cj]C[bad shape
right way to  sacrifice  (f17,f16)

maybe l17?

but c10 - better insteed

dont save bad groups at all stages of the game];W[gf];B[ic]
C[Here I was aiming to play lightly

very good wishes];W[gd];B[gc];W[he]C[why  black is making the ponuki for white?

ponuki=30 points (wellknown go proverb)

it is all that black lost :)];B[hd];W[id];B[jc];W[hc];B[hb]
;W[hd]MA[nd]C[
o16 maybe better];B[jd];W[je]MA[ci][np]C[bad shape for w


maybe c11

or o4 for example];B[lc]MA[nc][mc]C[too close


see n17 or o17];W[nc];B[md];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]C[see variant]

(;B[pe]LB[qe:A]C[I did not want to play A for fear of being cut.

I think black no need to live here


get territorial abilities in other places];W[rg];B[rh];W[ph]
;B[qh];W[mf];B[pi]MA[fp][ck]C[I played here to avoid being confined to the side and allowing white to build another wall.

f4 or c9 better];W[qm];B[oh];W[kf];B[qk]C[I feared white would play here and pin me against his wall at the top whilst gaining territory at the bottom.]
;W[ch];B[bg]LB[bf:A]MA[dj]C[Would A have been better?

good move

but  not to save the bad groups  better
