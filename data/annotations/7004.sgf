C[deagle02 [9k\]: hi
I was black in this game and won handily.  However, I think there are some very big misses and alot of undeveloped play.  The board looked aweful at the end, all territory and no stones.  I feel that is too loose, again, even though I won, there is much that could have been done to reduce territory and I don't know what is stronger, to be able to reduce or hold on to have more?

Thanks for the review in advance.

$ well, i think main followings can be A, B or C depending to stones around, but this doesnt loos the game   :o)
see variations, my favorite here is C but i'm not sure if there is a 'best' choice]

LB[cn:D][dn:C][fp:B][cq:E][fq:A]C[i felt that i could come in here to gain a small foot into the left since my other stones aare solid... should I have extended up the right? or attacked the top from my L17 stone?

$ this is very odd.
the left down corner is a good place to play but , in my opinion, can be consider in order of preference A B C D E (E helps white to build moyo).
here, your move is a contact move, helps white to reinforce corner with no good compensation for black]
