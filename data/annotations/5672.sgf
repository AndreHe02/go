C[Thank you for reviewing.
I'm black.
On the first half of the game I played ok, but second half somthing went wrong...
Could you comment at least 1st half of the game please.];B[pc]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[pe]C[I was told that pros don't play this move in this situation. R15 is ussually.]
;B[ph]C[I tried pincer.];W[oc];B[pd];W[od];B[oe];W[qe];B[ob]
;W[nb];B[pb]C[B: Very good! This is a horrible result for white.]
;W[mc];B[rd]C[Should I go here or maybe from other side?

B: This side is good! your stones in the corner need stability.]
;W[pg]
(;B[ne]C[B: This is not good. if white attaches your stone, you nearly always have to do something about the attached stone. In this case R13 is good. 
R13 nearly forces your oponent to play the move P14, which helps you extending where you want to extend anyway. (He might also play q14 in which case you foce him to bad form).
R13 induces your oponent to play a helping move.
(you get a position as if white would answer to your move O15 by playing P14, which would be silly of white)]
;W[ld]C[B: you can still play R13.]
(;B[og]C[wrong direction. you want to deprive white of his base.]
;W[oh];B[qg]C[Maybe q14 is better...
B: hard to tell. your position is not so easy anymore. I would have played O13 here, and let white live on the side, and get influence in the center.]
;W[pf];B[ng];W[qh]C[B: white turned his bad position into a good one.]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[rf]C[B: No! you have to play Q10! you cannot let white play there. This move is a big mistake! it does not help much, because of the atari at S13. It is like passing in a fighting position.]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[rg];B[re];W[qf]C[B: This is a very bad result for black now. whites position fits well to the stone on Q4. the additional points you made around T16 are nearly worthless, as your group in the corner was quite safe anyway.]
;B[qn]C[R6 or O3?
B: O3 is better. Do not play close to strength.];W[ql]C[bad move by white.  R5 followed by O4  is better.]
;B[on];W[pm];B[qq]C[B: your invasion weakens your stones R6 and P6. so it is not good. better Q6]
;W[qp];B[pn];W[pq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[pr];W[or];B[qs]

(;W[sp]C[B: very silly move.Even if this move would kill, it would be silly. It seems both of you like to attack before they are strong enough. white should play O4. Attacking the three white stones around Q6 is good for white.

In addition: locally the right move would be T2 for white (Ko). But it is much to early to attack the white corner]
;B[oq]C[B: Good!];W[nq];B[op];W[nr]
(;B[rn]C[This one probably was wrong.
B: You are right. Q5 is better.];W[oo];B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[po]
;B[mn];W[mo];B[lp];W[ln];B[nn];W[lo];B[ml];W[rr];B[sr];W[rs]
;B[mr]C[B: This does not work.];W[so]C[B: Why not N3? Black has no defense.]
;B[mq];W[sq];B[os];W[qr];B[ns];W[lm];B[nl];W[dp];B[fq];W[hq]
C[B: white plays to close to blacks thickness]
(;B[hp]C[B: F5 is better.];W[ip];B[ho]C[Maybe I should cut?
B: drawing back at G4 is the right form. But the attachment H4 was not good anyway. attaching strengthens white. And white needs strength. Cutting is not good. You usually play the cross cut when you are locally outnumbered by the oponents stones. But here you have so much strength to the right.]
;W[gq];B[dq];W[cq];B[dr];W[jo]C[B: not good. white lets you off easily. White should play C2 or E4]
;B[ep];W[cp];B[cn];W[dn];B[cm];W[eo];B[fo];W[fn];B[go]C[B: G4 is better. It aims at the cut at J3]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[el];B[dk];W[ed];B[ee];W[dd];B[de];W[cc];B[bd]
C[B: Better is C15. you let no weakness behind, and you threaten to continue with F16 or B17]
;W[fd];B[jd]C[I don't know... should i go there or better go to the left side near D12...

B: D12 would be far to passiv. I would play B17.  If white answers C18, I would continue with E9. This makes your position more stable, is big in the upper left corner and finally attacks the stones in the lower left corner.]
;W[dh]C[How to defend in this situation?
B: I would play F12. Not necessary to catch the stones, but to make profit from its struggles. That would even be better if you already played B17 and E9.]

(;B[ei]C[B: with this move you are kind of taking away your own option of E9. You would not like to play it anymore after a stone sits on E11.

In addition: you should attack from a certain distance. If you are attacking from to close, your attacking stone will come under attack. That is exactly what will happen here.]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[fg]C[B: Blacks position is difficult now. The mistake happened before.]
;B[eg];W[fi];B[gh];W[ej];B[di];W[dj];B[ci];W[cj];B[fj];W[ek]

(;B[bk]C[B: Those stones are lost. Defending them only wastes a move.]

;W[kc];B[jc];W[me];B[nd];W[nc];B[le];W[ke];B[mf];W[kd]
(;B[je]C[B: Do not push white into the direction of your own moyo! Erase this type of move from your play and you become a stone stronger.]
;W[kf];B[bc];W[db];B[cb];W[dc];B[fb];W[bb];B[ab];W[ca]
(;B[gc]C[Now I'm thinking, if I went to E18, I could probably kill white group...
B: Maybe you are right. At least a difficult fight would start, which would be good for you, as you are behind.]

;W[sj];B[rj];W[sl];B[kb]C[something went wrong...
B: yes, probably you knew, you were behind and tried to attack without really looking. Or maybe the time pressure...
Indeed maybe the whole game was played to fast, so that some moves were not really thought through so well. It is better to get a game analyzed, were one has spent more time.]
