AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[[M\]: I am Malweth, 7k? KGS from USA.

I want to first note that playing a computer (GnuGo) is not like playing a person. GnuGo is rated approximately 8 kyu, but you say you have a fairly steady ranking of 13k KGS. The fact that you gave GnuGo a 4 stone handicap indicates to me that you are learning where GnuGo makes bad plays - otherwise you would probably be about 5-kyu.

With this in mind, I will put some of my focus on where Black could have taken advantage of your groups.

hi,im hydejackal 13k on kgs, from Malaysia.  19yrs old.
This is a game within me and gnuGo level10.  My first attempt to play 4H with "him" also first time to request review. :p
i hope someone can review my game and comment on my moves and mistakes made by me and my opponent.
Thank you very much :)

My color is white.
forgive me if my language is impolite.];W[nq];B[jp]C[i felt that in this game... i've played a few moves very good, but i did not realize it.
so i hope u can point out some good moves made by me..or mistake so i can remember them..and in future play it again.]
;W[gp]C[[M\]: This is good handicap opening. From what I understand of playing White in a handicap game, you should attempt to play in as many parts of the board as possible. 

One of the big aims of G4 and O3 is to cut off K4 and build a group around it. You seem to have done this well as I will comment later.
----

well...this opening... i don know much ..actually... i just saw pros play this a lot..so i followed..
if possible, i would like to know some other variations after white played here.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[jn]C[[M\]: This is the right idea... K4 is being attacked and W is able to make a group out of nothing. This is often seen in higher handicap games (6-9 stone).]
;B[dn];W[jo]C[[M\]: This move seems slow and heavy. K4 is already well attacked and white should think about moving to a different section of the board (open up new territory).
--
is this correct? or...should i play somewhere else?];B[ip]C[[M\]: This is a bad move by black. It's bigger to move elsewhere on the board. This makes a heavy group.]
;W[ho]C[[M\]: This is the best move.];B[qk]C[[M\]: Black R9 was questionable... W can attack the corner at R3 later...]
;W[cl]C[[M\]: This is a good attack. You have a number of possibilities right now in the opening.]
;B[cj];W[el];B[fn]C[[M\]: White is now weak around H6. This is only a spot for B to aim for, though.]
;W[di]
(;B[ci]
(;W[dj]C[[M\]: Backtracking like this is usually bad. There is a similar joseki to this.

See variation for probable continuation.];B[dh]C[[M\]: Now B has a better position on the left side.]
;W[eh];B[dg]
(;W[ck]C[[M\]: A black play at D9 is probably bad for B.];B[ee]
C[[M\]: This seems like a very slow play. B would do better to take the K16 point.]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[co]C[[M\]: If your aim was to kill this group, C3 was better than E3 - but neither is yet possible.]
;B[cn];W[ep];B[do];W[bo]C[[M\]: This makes the dead group bigger and gives B a second line defense.]
;B[bn]C[i think i lost the corner..so i tenuki];W[id]C[[M\]: The third line play is usually better when black is thick on both sides.]
;B[kc];W[qf]C[[M\]: This is a handicap game, so leaving J16 is possible, but not often good.

This move seems ok. White will be a little overconcentrated, but lives easy. See variations.

---

i think this move got problem.....  i think is bad.. coz i got a feeling black can reply one killer move]

(;B[qh]C[is r12 a good severe reply to my q14?
i think l15 is better for black, is that so?]
(;W[nd]C[[M\]: The double approach is good... the standard reply to R12 is S17... the problem is that black will become very thick. This might not be bad in this case because black already has a lot of influence -- however, since you're trying to gain influence here now, it's better to play like O16.]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[re]C[[M\]: B should always play P14.
---
i think im lucky again.. for black playing s15... is there a better move for black?]
;W[of];B[rf];W[qe]C[[M\]: Pushing here is always bad unless you plan on cutting (cut does not work here, though) Think of it this way - W cannot play R17 if black has already played R16.]
;B[qd]
(;W[pe]C[[M\]: This gives W bad shape. O12 might be better.]
;B[od];W[nf]
(;B[gl]C[[M\]: This B play is dangerous because of the cut. Attacking J16 would be better. Additionally, B is better locally if he plays H7 since this aims at the cut J5.]
;W[fm];B[gm];W[en];B[fo];W[eo];B[fp];W[fq]C[[M\]: This is a big loss for B.]
;B[kp]C[[M\]: Saving this stone is probably bad... especially at this point in the game.]

(;W[ln]C[im so afraid my meal will run away.... i think this is good to attack the bottom and forming centre moyo.
at the same time... im scared he'll be able to make 2 eyes....or connect to the right...]
;B[kr];W[hq];B[mr];W[nr];B[iq];W[lq]C[[M\]: This B group is almost alive now. This move is required to attempt a kill.
----
wasn't sure this is the correct move.... i dare myself to play this..
pls comment? :)];B[lr];W[kq];B[hr];W[gr];B[js];W[hs];B[lp];W[mq]
;B[mo]C[[M\]: Now you wish the M5 move was there. This changes things from B being attacked to W O2 group being attacked.]
;W[ir];B[no];W[op]
(;B[or]C[[M\]: Currently W cannot be killed. See variations. Black has lived, however - but this may be ok for W because G7 group is almost dead.

pls comment on this life and death (it's called tesuji?)];W[os]

(;B[jr];W[oo];B[jq]C[[M\]: This move for B means that white might die now. When W could cut at K2 or K3, W had more liberties than the L2 group. Now B is almost fully connected (except for P6) so a W move there is necessary.]
;W[lo]C[[M\]: It is a valid threat against M4 group, however... (See variation)

i think tis is a waste..should it be better at p6?];B[on]
(;W[pq];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[rr];B[rq];W[qp];B[rp];W[qo];B[rs]
;W[sr];B[sq];W[ps];B[ss];W[rr];B[sr];W[ns];B[po];W[qs];B[ro]
;W[rr]C[[M\]: White is dead. A Black play at R6 can ensure this.

i feel so good...~~ :P
did i just solve a dan problem?! i can't believe it myself.... :p]

(;B[qr]C[[M\]: This move is bad... it should wait for later! R6 is needed!

----

r2 neccessary? r6 better..?];W[nn];B[qn];W[mp]C[[M\]: This is a huge loss for black. Computers are bad at this type of reading or it should have been able to see that W could die easily.]
;B[gj]C[[M\]: White needs to attack the G10 group now!];W[rg]
;B[qg];W[pf]C[[M\]: These three stones are very light at this point in the game.]
;B[fl];W[em];B[nc];W[mc];B[mb];W[rd];B[rc];W[nb]
(;B[oc];W[lb]
(;B[ke]C[[M\]: Sacrificing L17 works better for B. The L15 play seems worthless.]
;W[fd]C[[M\]: The lower approach might be better here (F17)]
;B[lc];W[md];B[if]C[[M\]: This move is bad by B for exactly the reason of W127.]
;W[je];B[jf];W[kf]C[[M\]: It still seems as though B has more fight left in him at M15. See variation.

However... that doesn't mean it's Black's best way to play. Black should force as much as possible using J14 (such as at J15). Black should be trying to make G10 live (connect out).]

(;B[ec];W[jc];B[kb]C[[M\]: Playing this way is aji keshi (getting rid of B's good aji: N18). It's also making a dead group bigger. The only possible escape for this B group is M14.]
;W[ma]
(;B[ka];W[ib];B[kg];W[lf]C[[M\]: Now the loss is even bigger above!! Black just hurt himself here.]
;B[ob]C[[M\]: This would have been sente if B did not play the L18 forcing move.]
;W[ih]C[[M\]: G12 looks good too. This type of cap is often a good play.]
;B[ei]C[[M\]: Black seems to be playing wild moves now. E11 can be captured fairly easily.]
;W[fh]C[[M\]: this is probably the best way...];B[ff];W[jg]
;B[le];W[mg];B[lg];W[mf];B[jh];W[ig];B[fi]
(;W[fk]C[[M\]: This probably wasn't the best way to prevent the cut... see variations.]

(;B[gk];W[gh];B[jj];W[li];B[ek];W[ej];B[fj];W[dk];B[jl];W[lk]
;B[nm];W[mm];B[hf]C[here it starts to hurt....]
(;W[gf]C[[M\]: You have a couple problems here... First of all, J18 is very weak, though you probably can kill L19 first in semeai. 

Secondly, it's more important to save the J13 group (and kill G10 for sure). see variation for W move.

----

i guess..this move is the cause.... i tot i can kill the h14 black group first... :(
this move should be at j11?];B[gg];W[ge];B[hh]
(;W[hi]C[[M\]: There's not a lot you can do now... the best you can do is save J12. See Var.

----

wrong reading...];B[ii];W[fg]C[[M\]: W is making a dead group bigger. This is a forcing move that doesn't really accomplish much.]
;B[hg];W[cr]C[[M\]: This is sente... Black needs to respond or die!]

(;B[kd]
(;W[fe];B[ef]
(;W[gc]C[[M\]: P7 is the wrong direction unless you've read through the results of P7. O8 is a good move if you can't read P7.

G17 isn't bad... not sure if this is the vital point, but it looks good.

----

unneccessary? i was thinking of p7 also];B[nl];W[pi];B[qi];W[ok]
;B[nk];W[oj];B[bj];W[bm]C[[M\]: Now B is dead.];B[gn];W[pl]
;B[ql]
(;W[qj]C[[M\]: It is probably better to force at Q7. after BS10, WQ10, black doesn't need to respond.]
;B[rj];W[pk];B[pm];W[cb]C[wasn't sure of this... i tot black will f18... if he f18... then c18 dead?]

(;B[bc]C[[M\]: See variations. Looks like this is the best for B under the circumstances.

is this a mistake? or was it neccessary?];W[eb];B[fb];W[dc]
;B[cc];W[db];B[ed];W[fc]LB[ic:35p][se:35p][eg:40p][fr:75p]C[[M\]: Yes it does. This seems best for both. The game is almost over now and only big points are left on the board. The biggest are B18 & A6. 

White is far ahead because of the large capture on the bottom side, the large capture of the lower left corner, the big invasion in the upper left, and the capture of L19. Approximate scores (nearest 5pts) have been inserted. Totalling these up give an approximate score of:
Black: 75p
White: 110p
a difference of at least 35p.

C[[M\]: This game was well played, but I think most 8-10k players wouldn't abandon the D3 group so easily. Saving this group seems as though it would be worth about 40 points (plus taking gote, perhaps). You must always be suspect when playing a computer.

Computer players have only reached a maximum of 8-kyu ratings, but a human player who always plays versus the computer will eventually learn tricks that fool the computer but wouldn't fool another person (these can be considered "bad habits"). In my opinion, you should consider abandoning the computer bot as a study tool and concentrate on playing real people.

As I said, GnuGo is among the strongest computer players at about 8-kyu. There is not yet a dan level computer player. I believe a dan level computer is a long time away.

Good luck with Go study and try to play more games with real people!
