Is this move ok?
*********
[J\] It feels to me like you should prefer the 4th line
instead. The 3rd line is considered territory, the 4th
influence. So, 1) it seems too conservative to be going
just for terr. at this point, 2) if W O17, B M17 then J16
would have been better, 3) if W R14, B N16 then the corner
is a bit too vunerable, if W R14, B N17 then the top is
too low (3rd line), but W R14, B N17 then J16 is better
shape. Of W has many other responses to J16 but most result
in similar shapes to these. If B gets to play first at the
top, then N17 with J16 looks better to me than what you
do with J17.];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[rd];B[nd]C[[J\] A little  far from J17, maybe N16 is a better
balance between J17 and protecting against W Q15.];W[qk];B[qm];W[dj];B[qi]
C[[J\] Hmm. Black will lose something in trying to
save this stone. I'd prefer Q11 here - gain
outside influence (which will combine well with
the top or bottom) and try to contain W against
the right side.];W[pi];B[ph];W[qh];B[pj];W[oh];B[qj];W[jp];B[np]C[[J\] This  doesn't prevent 3-3 invasion and
doesn't threaten K4. Look for moves that
serve multiple purposes. A 3rd line move
would protect 3-3 better and later threaten
to reach under K4. Q3,O3,N3,M3 all leave
better followup moves.];W[ge];B[ie];W[hd];B[hc];W[hg];B[cb]C[[J\] Not big  enough for this stage in the
game. A big move, but whole lower left
needs to be addressed first.];W[jg];B[he];W[gd];B[ce];W[bc];B[de];W[ee]
;B[ed]C[******
would e14 first have been better?
******
[J\] I don't think so, but somewhere on the C
line below C15 first may be.];W[ec];B[fd]C[[J\] D17 instead lets B keep  sente and
looks more profitable. Try some variations
and see what you think.];W[dc];B[eb];W[cf];B[be];W[bf];B[bb];W[ae];B[fe]
;W[ef];B[gf];W[ff];B[hf];W[jm]C[******
W has so much influence now, I knew I should  invade, but I was not sure where. c3 or so  seemed to small.
**************
[J\] Size is less of an issue than B C3 being a
gote invasion - White should be able to end
with sente and Black sealed in the corner and
then play G13 or numerous other important  points and come out still ahead. I'd try
reducing with G13 and a few followup moves
then maybe F3. Unfortunately B still needs to
prevent R3 :(];B[gg];W[hh];B[mg]C[[J\] Too loose and too vague of a
threat. K13 can still invade and
White's right side is strong. I'd
have continued near G13 to see if an
attack on H12 might be possible later -
then a move near N13 would make more sense.];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[co]
;B[eq]C[*****
should have been f2, right? How to go on then?
*****
[J\] I don't know the best invasion. F2 seems
too timid. Maybe D2 and then try to live
inside or outside, sacrificing as necessary
depending on which way White responds.];W[gq];B[cq]C[[J\] C2 much stronger  than here.]
;W[dq];B[cr]C[[J\] You must D2 instead.];W[dr];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq]C[[J\] A2 and B1 are the critical points.
I believe White can kill if B A2, W B1
but you'll make White work harder and
you can tenuki after that exchange and
leave lots of ko threats and the possibility
saving the corner with some outside
moves later.];W[br];B[cs];W[ds];B[ar];W[bs];B[gh];W[gj];B[eh];W[ch];B[hi]
;W[gi];B[ii];W[jh];B[ji];W[lh];B[li];W[mh];B[lg];W[kh];B[nh]C[[J\] Obviously this  move would have been
better used elsewhere ...];W[ni];B[mi];W[ng];B[mk];W[jk];B[ki];W[mm];B[nj]
;W[lq];B[mq]C[[J\] Probably should protect against
R3 better - perhaps P2 instead.];W[lp];B[ik];W[hk];B[il];W[gm];B[fi];W[jl]
;B[hj];W[gk];B[ej];W[ek];B[di];W[ci];B[dk];W[cj];B[fk];W[el];B[fl]C[[J\] G8  is the move here, not F8. Try
several variations. Do you see the
snapback on W G9 group in several of
the possibilities?];W[fm];B[hm];W[gl];B[fj];W[im];B[hl];W[hn];B[ij];W[jn]
;B[om]C[[J\] Does the C3 invasion seem as
small now as you thought earlier?
If the corner had been unplayed until
now, C3 would be the move!];W[ke];B[le];W[jd];B[kf];W[jf];B[je];W[pa];B

[[J\] B A16 could have  started a ko
until this white move. Winning this
ko would have put you only about 5
points behind white.];B[eg];W[fg];B[fh];W[dg];B[dl]C[*******
I just wanted t try to use the aji of dead group in the corner
**********
[J\] Always a good thing to be thinking about,
but White is extremely thick now.];W[em];B[dm];W[dn];B[en];W[gn];B[cn];W
[do];B[bn];W[ao];B[bk]C[abulafia 18k*: oops ..];W[bj]C[abulafia 18k*: wnted to  play b8,
but well ..
[J\] Actually this move seems better than
B8. B8 too easily for White. But I don't  see life for Black in any case ...]
;B[al];W[ck];B[cl];W[bm];B[kg];W[ms];B[ig];W[ih];B[if]C[yachi 17k*: hahaha we both made mistake
you could play O12!];W[nh]C[abulafia 18k*: no, it was not atari yet.
abulafia 18k*: I had to play h14 first.
yachi 17k*: oh i see];B[ac]C[yachi 17k*: sorry];W[ad];B[ab];W[jj]C[abulafia  18k*: I was watching it all
the time waiting for a chance, but it
didnt turn up ..];B[kj];W[sh];B[ri];W[mq]C[[J\] record ends here but Black needs
another move at Q9. Otherwise W Q9,
B S9, W T10, B S10, W S8];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt])
