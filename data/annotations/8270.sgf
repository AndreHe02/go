C[Hi I'm Anand and I'm about 14 kyu on IGS. I played Black in this game. It was a very hard fought game and White got short of time and made some blunders in the endgame, so I won.

I would like to know your comments on all phases of the game. I would especially like your comments on

a) Direction of play
b) Proper way to reduce/invade frameworks.

I've also added some comments at some points in the game myself.

Thanks in advance for your review.

....

N: Hi, I'm Numsgil; 4k on KGS.  I've marked all my comments starting with an N.  In general, I've kept your comments in place and responded to them.]
;B[pd]C[h651: Hi!];W[dc];B[qp];W[cp]TR[dq]C[N: White usually prefers triangle.  Ideally you want your "influential side" to face the opponent.  So white has given you effectively a very nice approach.]
;B[oq];W[dj]C[N: I think white is trying to be too high concept.  This is almost like a chinese opening, but it's just not as good.]
;B[ep]C[N: good];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]C[Played high to balance the low enclosure on the right.

N: Yes, good.  I'd say this result, while locally a joseki, globally favors black.  White isn't sure if he's going for territory or building a moyo.]
;W[nc];B[qf]TR[dc]C[I didn't want to pincer since the marked stone was low.

N: A pincer would be playable, I think, but this is absolutely acceptable, too.]
;W[ne]TR[em][fm][en]SQ[ce][ic]C[This move worried me though, if W can get a few more moves on the top side he would have a nice framework.

N: White already has a framework.  But so does black.  You're certainly not behind.  But yes, this is a powerful move by white.  It's on the border between your two moyos, and so enlarges white's moyo and shrinks your own.

In this case, the mirror move somewhere near triangle could be an appropriate response.  An invasion would also be good, depending on what sort of game you want to play.  Squares would be my choice of an invasion.  Either a low approach against the corner (white will almost certainly pincer, so you need to know the josekis or be able to muddle through) or a wedge on the side.]
;B[kc]TR[mc][md][ld][lc][kd]CR[jc][jd]C[To take away White's base.

Thinking now, it seems that this move itself gave W a chance to build up his framework on the top side.

My question here is: What's a good plan for Black?

N: In addition to my comments for the last move, this is simply too close to white's wall.  Any of triangle moves are too close.  The wall is 5 high off the edge, with a 1 gap defect on the 4th line, so anything less than 4 spaces (5 - 1) from the wall is too close (for both players).  Circles are exactly 4 spaces away, and are playable in some circumstances, but you have to have a plan because white can take away your base and force you to make a 1 space jump towards his wall.  You'll probably live, but not with good points.]
;W[ic]C[N: This is excatly correct by white.];B[ke]C[N: Yes.]
;W[ie]TR[nc][ne]SQ[le][me][mf][nf][of][pf]C[N: Careful white.  Triangle stones are within black's sector lines (squares).  Ideally white should run with these stones right now.]
;B[kg]SQ[lg][mg][ng][of][pf][nf]C[N: Yes, good.  White's group on the right is in trouble now because it's well behind black's sector line (squares).]
;W[ng]C[N: Yes, white needs to run.];B[ph]SQ[dj][ej][fj][fi]
[gi][hi][mh][lh][kh][ki][ji][ii]C[Taking territory while trying to attack.

N: Ordinarily this is exactly what you want to do.  But notice that your group is still in danger (behidn the sector line marked by squares).  You should probably run with it still.]
;W[pb]C[N: This is a classic newbie mistake.  It's not critical, but white loses out a bit from the exchange.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[qd];W[od]TR[pc][nc][pb][qb][ne][ng]
C[I've often heard that this slide doesn't guarantee White two eyes and loses the corner invasion for White. Provided W is cut off from the center and has to make one more eye on the side, is it possible to kill the marked group?

N: Yes, but it's tricky, certainly.  More to the point, even if you can't kill it you can chase it for profit.]
;B[ki]C[N: Yes, critical.];W[ce]C[N: This is big, but white's group is in extreme danger, and so it's urgent.]
;B[mb]TR[ni]C[N: Careful now.  Attacking this group is the right idea, but the rule to "killing" groups is:

1.  Contain groups before robbing them of eyes.  White can still run to triangle.
2.  Make sure you have side profit when you attack a group.  Even pros can't always read out if a group is going to die when they attack it.  So instead, you attack in a way that gives you extra profit.  As long as the attack is sente (which it should be unless you actually manage to kill the group, and then white should let it die and take sente himself), your profit is for free.

In this case, you get a little bit of eyespace for your black group here, and you make it harder for white to make eyes here, and from an endgame perspective this is worth a handful of points.  But compared to triangle, this is small potatoes.  With triangle, even if white's group lives it's entirely surrounded and you have an imposing wall that turns the entire bottom right of the board into almost secured moyo.  You'd also almost have your black center group connected to your black right group.]
;W[nb];B[lb]TR[ni]C[N: You end in gote, so white can now play triangle and ruin so much of what could have been yours.]
;W[ql]TR[ni]C[N: White is showing some bravado, but now black has an excellent attack at triangle which he should be able to make in sente, and even if white ignores it and black is actually unable to kill the top white group, black still ends up with a wall that white's new side group is going to drown inside.]
;B[qj]TR[ni]C[To deny this stone a base.

N: Triangle is bigger by a wide margin.  Also, white can't create a normal two space base anyway, so at best white's group is going to be cramped and not generate lots of points for white, so robbing white's base here isn't as urgent as it would otherwise be.]
;W[ol]TR[ni]C[N: White is deep inside black's moyo, with two weak groups and a perfect splitting attack by black at triangle.  This is a bad spot for white.]
;B[nh]LB[ne:1][ql:2]C[Trying to separate the groups 1 and 2. I don't think the group 1 is alive yet. Would O11 have been better? (not touching the stone?)

N: Yes,  by a wide margin.  Unless you can read a specific reason, never touch stones you are trying to attack (the reverse also holds: touch stones to build strength if you are in white's position here).]
;W[og];B[oh];W[pe];B[pf];W[md]C[N: White is probably alive right now.  But you managed to build up strength to attack white's other invasion, so this is a reasonable result.]
;B[kl]C[N: Maybe a bit lax, but not a bad move.  Definitely the right idea.]
;W[dg]SQ[eg][ef][ff][gf][hf][he][go][hn][im][jl][kk][kj][kh]
[kf][kd][kb][ra][ma][na][qa]C[N: White says even if you kill that group he has enough points to win.  This is not true.  If territories are consolidated along the lines (formed by the squares), you'd win by a handsome margin.]
;B[en]TR[qn]C[Should I continue my attack on the bottom side?

N: This is such a huge move that I don't mind that you took this.  But yeah, as soon as you can you should probably add a stone at triangle or thereabouts and make white's death final.  As it is there is enough aji that I don't feel confident black can be sure of killing white's stones.  Of course, you can also just count the score and see if you can afford to let white live there if he tries.  But I don't think you can.]
;W[ml]C[N: At this point, this is probably white's only chance.  This is an issue of sabaki, which I'm not great at, but white's move seems reasonable enough given that this is a desperation play.]
;B[ln]TR[qn]C[N: This or triangle are good moves.  This is good because it encloses white AND builds profit in sente (the small moyo on the left is almost solid territory now).  Triangle builds profit in sente but it might be possible for white to escape (it would be a hard run, though).]
;W[mj];B[mh]C[N: Yeah, aji comes back to bite you in the bum.  I don't see any clever sequences that would save you here.]
;W[oj]MA[ql][ol][ml][mj]TR[db]SQ[gg]CR[cl]C[I was beginning to get worried now, If the maked group lives, I'm not sure how I would counter the white framework on the left and top. That territory looks big.

N: Yep.  Some ideas, if we assume white is alive: triangle is a probe.  Square is a reduction.  Circle is an invasion.  You'd have to count the score, but I think either the probe or the invasion would be called for.]
;B[pk];W[pl];B[ok];W[nk];B[lk]TR[nm]C[N: I'm not super great at these sorts of tactics.  This is a reasonable enough play.]
;W[on];B[qn]C[N: Yes.];W[mk]TR[nm]SQ[qi];B[nm]TR[mm]C[N: Yes.  This threatens to cut, so it's hard for white to get too clever with his response.  Although if white pushed at triangle it could get complicated.]
;W[nl];B[nn]TR[mn]C[N: I'd prefer triangle.  This leaves a lot of aji.]
;W[oo];B[om];W[mm];B[mn];W[pm];B[pn]C[N: I'd say white is dead now.]
;W[lj];B[kj];W[pj];B[qk];W[qi];B[rl];W[rm];B[ri];W[rk];B[rj]
;W[sl];B[qm]C[N: White needs two full eyes to live.  Be careful that you're not being too greedy.  This is giving white a lot of aji to play with.]
;W[rn];B[ro]TR[pp][qo]C[N: I think you can do something solid like either triangle, and white should still die.  Playing this way leaves a lot of aji.  Make sure you're _very_ confident that you've read out a clean kill.]
;W[pp];B[qo];W[pq];B[qq];W[pr];B[qr]C[I was now worried about my corner.

N: I think you need to descend here, yeah.];W[nq];B[ps]TR[lq]
C[N: Remember, white needs two full eyes to live.  And even if he makes this group live, you still have enough points to win.  No need to press your luck.  Attack the stones from a distance, in profit.  As long as your corner lives, you're golden.]
;W[os];B[qs];W[nr];B[qh]C[N: Note that as a result of your exchange, white's bottom group is much stronger than it was.  That's the danger of attacking in contact.

But yeah, it's very good to take care of this aji here now.  You're in good shape to win, and can afford to play sensibly and cautiously.]
;W[ll];B[kk];W[km];B[lm];W[rl]TR[km]C[N: What does white think he's doing?  These stones weren't in atari, and there was nothing threatening that connection.  Plus, it's really obvious now that these stones are dead.

Much better to do something with the triangle stone.];B[jm]
C[N: Yes, grab it firmly and reduce the mischief white can get to.]
;W[kn];B[ko];W[kr];B[ir];W[so];B[sp];W[sq];B[sn]C[N: Yes.  White's just throwing stones on the board and wasting good ko threats.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[iq];B[jq];W[jr];B[hq];W[ip];B[io];W[ig]TR[dj]
[ei][fi][fh][gh][gg][hg][cn][cm][dl][dk][dm][fm][gl][hk][ij]
[ji]C[Since I lost half the bottom side, I'm not sure what to do now. I try to pick up a fight on the left side.

N: I'd say you got a reasonable result on the right side, given how white played.  With a moyo, you should only reasonably expect to get a third of it as net profit at the end.  I think you got a bit more than that, if we count the entire right side.

Anyway, when you're not sure what to do, count the score.  By my estimate, the score is approximately even.  So there's no need to go super desparate.  Play reducing moves and bring the game to the end.  Whoever has the stronger end game will probably win.]
;B[cm]TR[dm][dl][cl]C[N: Any of circles would be normal.  This can work, too, but it's harder.]
;W[dn];B[dm]C[N: This is normally good, but here it invites a harsh cut.  This is part of why I don't like attaching like you did.]
;W[em];B[el];W[fm];B[fl];W[fn];B[eo];W[dl];B[cl];W[dk];B[gm]
C[N: This is a tricky capture race.];W[gn];B[hm];W[ck];B[bn]
;W[bo];B[bk];W[bm];B[bl];W[an]C[N: You're in good shape here.  You have 3 liberties and white has 3 liberties, and it's your turn.  Unless something bad happens, you've won.]
;B[hn];W[go];B[ho];W[bj];B[gp];W[ak];B[fo];W[al];B[em];W[fj]
TR[jb][fr]C[The endgame is now starting I think. Not too many points left in the center.

N: This whole side sequence was part of the endgame, actually.  Endgame happens sooner than most people think.  In the end, I suppose it's a matter of semantics, though.

This move by white is worth less than you might think.  Triangle moves are almost certainly bigger.]
;B[jb];W[ib]TR[er]C[N: Good, you have sente to take the other big point at triangle, too.]
;B[ia];W[ha];B[ja];W[gb];B[gh]C[This was one line too much inside. H11 might have been better.

N: Yes.  This is an invasion.  No need for that.  Much too deep.]
;W[hi]C[N: I'd just sacrifice the stone at this point and cut your losses.  I didn't count again, but I think you're still ahead.]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[hj];W[hh];B[ii];W[ih];B[ij];W[ra];B[sb];W[jf]
;B[kf];W[mf];B[jd]TR[er]C[N: Triangle is bigger.  You might get this in sente, but white might not respond, and you don't have a very big followup then.  Triangle is gote, but it has a sente followup, and is much much bigger.]
;W[id];B[no];W[np];B[lq];W[lr];B[hr]TR[er]C[N: No need.  Triangle is still big.]
;W[kq];B[lp];W[kp];B[hp];W[mq];B[of];W[nf];B[oe]TR[er]C[N: This is big, but triangle is bigger.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[mc]C[N: At best this is a wasted ko threat.]
;W[lf];B[lg]C[N: Not necessary.  Even if white could cut, as long as your top group can connect to either other group, all your stones will live.]
;W[mp];B[lo]TR[er]C[N: Believe it or not triangle is _still_ bigger.]
;W[po];B[sr]C[N: I think you can live without this, but okay, it's 1 point so not the end of the world.]
;W[jh];B[kh]C[N: Not needed.  The top group is definitely connected to the right side group, which is definitely alive.]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[gk];B[hk]TR[er]C[N: Triangle is still bigger.]
;W[ji];B[jj];W[gl];B[hl];W[na];B[er]C[N: Good.];W[dr];B[fr]
;W[ds]C[N: You get it in sente, too, which is nice.];B[es]C[N: This is worth a little more than 1 point.  There are larger gote moves on the board.]
;W[ma];B[hs]TR[js]C[Misclick, meant to be J1. Also, this was the last move before the time control so I was in a hurry.

N: Triangle is even better.  These stones are definitely alive, so don't be afraid to hane.]
;W[js];B[ka]TR[la]C[N: Triangle is better.  I don't think white has any squeezing plays you need to be afraid of.]
;W[la]C[N: Now you have no way to secure points here.];B[ek]
;W[jc];B[ej]C[N: Good.  The stones on top are in atari, but you can do so much damage down here if white ignores you.]
;W[ei];B[di]TR[gh][gi][fj][gj][gk][gl]C[I chose C10 over E12 because I heard that in endgame sides are bigger than center. Aslo, B11 afterwards looked interesting with the monkey jump possible afterwards.

Was it correct choice?

N: Any damage you do here is good damage.  As long as the triangle stones are yours and not white's, you're in good shape.]
;W[kb];B[cj]C[N: Good.  This is way bigger than saving the three remaining stones at the top.  It's a bit of mutual damage, but it favors you significantly.]
;W[fi]C[N: White saves these stones, but you took adequate compensation on the edge.]
;B[bi];W[dh];B[af];W[bh];B[ah];W[aj];B[ai];W[am];B[ad]TR[ae]
[be]C[N: This is too greedy.  But the refutation is beyond me usually :P  Triangle is the usual followup from an open monkeyjump.]
;W[bd];B[ae];W[lc];B[bb];W[cb];B[bc];W[bg];B[ag];W[ba];B[cc]
;W[db];B[cd];W[dd];B[be];W[cf];B[ch];W[ab];B[ac];W[ca];B[ci]
;W[cg];B[jn]C[N: This isn't necessary.];W[aa];B[jg]C[My opponent ran out of time here. Right now I'm winning comfortably by 20-30 points I think.

However if my opponent hadn't made the big blunder on the left hand side the game would've been quite close.

What are your thoughts on where I went wrong in this game?

N:  The entire game was either you winning handsomly or the game being even.  I don't think your opponent was ever comfortably ahead, so I can't say you went particularly wrong anywhere.

In terms of mistakes that you should try to address, though: enclose before you try to kill, and make sure you have side profit if you're going for the kill but can't read it out to the end.  And don't touch stones you're attacking.  I know it's tempting, but unless there's some specific sequence you're reading out you're just making trouble for yourself, since it tends to strengthen the group you touch.]
