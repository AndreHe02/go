C[
DRS: I have two primary questions about this game, at moves 110 and 215, related to the UL.  Any other other comments you'd like to make would be interesting as well.


Hi Dan!
A very good game from both sides. But in the UL corner endposition both players just forget to count freedoms which was very easy.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[dc];W[de];B[dh];W[pq];B[qo]LB[fd:a]C[another idea would be playing in the ul corner (f16 =a) to punish whites tennuki]
;W[np];B[qk];W[ef]MA[gd][ec]LB[fd:a][cc:b][cb:c][cd:d][eb:e]
C[this move is unusual, because the black pincer stone is high. For example after the sequence a-e white has no good continuation. Perhaps preferable for white would be e17 or g16.]
;B[gc];W[do];B[dl];W[fp];B[eo];W[ep];B[dp];W[en];B[co];W[dn]
C[better to take the black stone to solve the problem of a ladder break.]
;B[cn];W[eh];B[di]LB[ei:a]C[good! bending around with a would strengthen whit and leave a cut.]
;W[ic];B[ge]LB[fd:a]C[I don´t like this move because of white can peep at a (f16). Perhaps black b (h16) would be better.]

C[a tricky ladder break! but black has to keep the possibility in mind, that w will give up the three stones.
To my opinion this is a difficult position for b. How to answer the peep a(f16)? There is an invasion point at b (r7). And w has the option of an anoying double hane  on the right side (sequence c-k).
On the other hand: b has a lot of secure territory. And with l (f2) he can reduce whites lower side.
If I were b I would play a (f16) to secure the ul position and preparing an attack on the white e14-group.]
;W[fo];B[fr];W[hq];B[nn];W[pi];B[ok];W[mi];B[jg];W[ig];B[ih]
;W[hg];B[jh]LB[li:a]C[this looks to heavy. better would be a (m11). if w then cuts at k12 b has the driving tesuji k11 and so on.
Black didn´t play very well so far. He forced white to connect his week group and managed to get an weak group himself.]
;W[hh]C[too slow. if black plays here white just answers g13.
Its difficult to find the right way to attack this black group. K10 looks good. Perhaps this is the time for white to take the lower right corner with r4.]
;B[jk]C[now black is "free" and white gained almost nothing from attack h12.]
;W[qp];B[ro];W[rp];B[lo]C[If w had attacked with k10, black could never play such a reducing move.]
;W[mo];B[mn];W[ln]C[this cut looks like an overplay.];B[ko]
;W[lm];B[ho];W[jq];B[jn];W[lk]LB[lj:a][mj:b][mk:c]C[black can cut with a-c (m10, n10, n9)]
;B[hi]LB[lq:a]C[a (m3) would have been better.];W[lp];B[kp]
;W[kq];B[gl]LB[gq:a]C[why didnt black cut of the white stones with a (g3)??]
;W[fq];B[gr];W[hp];B[fj]LB[lj:a][mj:b][mk:c]C[this is unnecessary, b has no problems with his group,  because he can cut off the white stones.]
;W[fd]C[better c17 first and then crosscut.];B[fc];W[gd];B[cf]
LB[ed:a]C[better at a (e16)
this move hurts the corner.];W[ce];B[bc];W[be]LB[bf:a]C[thas locally not the best move. bending around at a would be better.]
;B[bf];W[hc];B[ed];W[ee];B[sp];W[sq];B[so];W[rq]C[better q 5 first]
;B[po];W[qh];B[ke];W[kd];B[le];W[eb];B[ec];W[cb];B[cc];W[db]
;B[gb];W[bb];B[ab];W[hb];B[ga]LB[fa:a]C[to your question: a (f19) instead of g19 and black will win the race without ko.]
;W[nd]LB[fa:a][ea:b][ba:c][ca:d][ac:e][ad:f][aa:g][bd:h][fb:i]
C[Question #1: Is there anything B can do, now that W has tenukied, to allow B to live in the UL without a ko?  How many outside liberties can W fill before B must respond?  How do you count that?

Yes, black can live without ko:  for example the sequence: a-i. You see, there is no problem for black. White cannot catch the corner-stone because black then will connect to the right side. if white doesn´t make an eye with b in answer to a, its just a matter of freedom counting : black is two freedoms ahead.]

;B[li];W[nk];B[ml];W[nl];B[mm];W[ol];B[mh];W[oi];B[pl];W[oj]
;B[pk]C[this move is bad, as you see in the game. even if there would be no aji for white, this move would be by far too small.]
;W[rh];B[rf];W[on];B[oo];W[pm];B[qm]LB[no:a]C[connecting at a would be sente. but playing a for white would be gote anyway, so there is no problem for black.]
;W[no];B[mi];W[sk];B[pn];W[om];B[rl]LB[op:a]C[why not a (p4)?]
;W[rn];B[rk];W[si];B[sl];W[rj];B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[lq];B[mp]
;W[hn]LB[nr:a]C[white should play a (o2)];B[im]LB[nr:a]C[better o2 in sente.]
;W[io];B[nr];W[qr];B[dg];W[eg];B[dm];W[gi];B[gj];W[ej];B[fl]
LB[ek:a][ng:b]C[why not a (e9)? from view of territory b (o13) would be bigger.]
;W[ek];B[el];W[dk];B[ck];W[fi];B[jf];W[if];B[ng];W[ha]LB[fa:a]
C[now with a (f19) black still will win the race.];B[ba];W[hr]
;B[eq]C[if you were not sure about the status of UL corner, why didn´t you play there? e3 is a small move.]
;W[gn];B[ks];W[kr];B[ls];W[js];B[mr];W[gq];B[je];W[jd];B[qj]
;W[oh];B[hm];W[ca];B[ea]LB[ac:a][aa:b]C[black shouldn´t allow w to take the corner-stone. Connecting at a and b (a17, a19) would asure unconditional life. white can reduce the left side territory of black a little bit.]
;W[aa];B[ac];W[af];B[bg]LB[fa:a]C[you have to let w into your left side and play a (f19).]
;W[ag];B[ah];W[ae];B[bh];W[ld]LB[fa:a]C[next chance for black, just a (f19)
its very easy to count the freedoms at this stage.];B[me];W[ad]
C[now its a ko.];B[fa];W[bd];B[da];W[cd];B[ba];W[hj]C[this ko-threat is by far to small. Let white take this stone and win the game. black is far ahead.]
;B[ii];W[aa];B[fe];W[hd];B[ba];W[re];B[fb]C[Question #2: Should I have responded in the UR?  I'm not sure, but I suspect I could have safely ignored one threat, and that it might have been productive to do so.  Then even though my ko threats all look small (true?), at least I'd get something out of it.

Also, what's this kind of ko called?  Is it "two-step" or "two-stage"?

Yes you should answer in the UR. for white it would be a two step ko, because after winning the ko he has to fill an outside freedom and then ko starts again.
I don´t see any more big ko threat for white, so I think you still would lead a lot.]
;W[qe]C[Now lets count:
white 5 komi + >60 points = >65 points
black: 7 more prisoners + >70
so black ist still ahead more then 10 points.

here commentary ends.];B[rd];W[sd];B[sb];W[ra];B[fk];W[gs];B[er]
