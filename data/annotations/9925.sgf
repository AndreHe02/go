For this game I'd suggest to learn one thing:

The game is most of the time divided into the parts:  the opening game, middle game and end game

In the opening game you usually take big points to build your moyo (or prevent our oponent from building his own), middle game is fighting (converting moyo into teritory, invading, ..) and endgame is about settling down the rest. Under the 'big points' I mean star points or empty sides. Something that could worth 10-15 points if you play there instead of your opponent.

I know that settling down the invading stones looks safe, then you are just reacting on the oponent's moves and loosing opportunities to gain more. When you (or oponent) could take a few points by extending his invasion, just ignore it and play the big points. It's not worth to play endgame moves (gaining 1-3 points) while the opening moves are not settled. 

 I know there's a proverb - "don't go fishing while your house is in fire", but it's necessary to recognize the when the fire is not so damaging anymore and the big points (empty territory) has more value than loosing 4-5 points elsewhere.]
