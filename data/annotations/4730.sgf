C[
* Hi, I'm white in this game. :) I lost the game very badly** and I guess it was because I wasn't really paying attention in the fuseki. Mutltiple move suggestions detailing the flaws / virtues of each along the way will be very useful, maybe marked A, B, C, etc. kinda like whole-board multiple choice problems? Thank you in advance.

(** Actually, suddenly during the endgame (which I like to play out, even when losing, for practice) white forfeited the game (maybe he lost on time, I didn't pay attention to the game time), something I was very upset over, as he was already winning very big, so I just felt embarrassed over having to carry the 'win' in my game history.)

BA : Hi. I've tried to point out mistakes and offer alternatives, marked with letters. I have shown variations for those alternatives. Hope you find the review useful. Thanks.

p.s. All my comments are denoted by 'BA' in front of them.]

BA : Rather unusual. Normally White plays at A or B. This is because letting Black play at those points would be very panful for White. (See next variation) See variation for alternatives to this move.]

(;B[dn]
(;W[cl]LB[dl:A]C[BA : Good move. Prevents Black from creating a moyo. I, however, would prefer a high move at A. See variation.]

* I adopted to sacrifice for the moment, or at least build up strength elsewhere before I tried to run. Bad idea?

BA : Yes, I would call it a bad idea :) The marked black group isn't exactly alive yet. Running with the marked White stone would help attack the group. On the contrary, sacrificing it would be good for Black. See variation for ideas.

Additionally, I would say this approach is from the wrong direction. I would prefer an approach from C. See variations.

See variation D from Black to see why I consider this the wrong direction.]

* I was happy about this invasion.

BA : You should be :) You still have a chance to run with the marked stone, and prevent Black from getting something like A.]

* Easy profit while attacking?

BA : Perhaps. Difficult to say the correct move here, though your move worked well.]
;B[lq];W[kr];B[el]TR[lq][nq]C[BA : Ouch. This is bad for White. But Black has an unstable group (marked)]

BA : Nice. Correct direction. Aims at attacking the marked stones, and reducing the black moyo.]

BA : See previous comments :)];W[dh];B[ch]
(;W[nl]C[
* Bad idea to abandon it? Was this decision that lost the game or was it lost before this?

BA : This would be it. Since Black defended against the reduction (not attacked), White should continue reducing, then run. The marked stones are half-dead anyway. See variation.]
;B[kl];W[jl];B[lj]
(;W[nj]LB[ji:A]TR[dh]C[BA : No, wrong direction. Should be A. A would help the marked white stone. White's right side territory is already secure. See variation.]

* Futile. Going to cut it short here as the rest of the game is not worth looking at. I tried some futile manoeuvres inside his moyo and at cutting etc, but it petered out into nothing. Black kept most of his now solid moyo and should've won by roughly 30-35 points.

BA : Yes. I've tried to point out the major mistakes. I'd say abandoning the reduction on his moyo was the losing move. Hope you find this review useful.]
