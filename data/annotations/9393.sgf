C[*fusaiji*: Hi!

[NM\] Hello, please review for the black side.

[NM\] I'm interested in the vital points for shape.

[NM\] Also the direction of play in the opening and middle game I would like some help with.

[NM\] I've put comments throughout the game where I was not sure what move to play or what strategy i should do.

[NM\] Any other help would be greatly appreciated!

[NM\] Many thanks, Neil];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[qp];B[cn];W[dk]
;B[cq]C[[NM\] What would you choose for black here? F3, E6, B4?

[Nexik\] Every move here is ok];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo]
;B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[go];B[op]LB[cf:A]C[[NM\] G3 is honte
[NM\] White can H3
[NM\] So i played on the lower side.

[NM\] What would you play here?

[Nexik\] G3 now is small. Move in the game is IMO questionable. I would rather play shimari at A (C14) to reduce white wall]
;W[pn];B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[kq]C[[NM\] M3 possible?
[NM\] I choose L3 because i thought it worked better with F3]
;W[eq];B[er];W[gq];B[fp]C[[NM\] Good to push here to make cutting point?]
;W[fo];B[fr];W[de];B[en]C[[NM\] Use the aji C6 stone now?

[Nexik\] White is too strong this is not good idead];W[eo];B[bn]
;W[ao];B[di]C[[NM\] I feel black should pincer now and use aji
[NM\] Mybe C15 but white gets sente

[Nexik\] You can complicate but I don't think this will end with good result for black]
;W[fd];B[ck]C[[NM\] I follow up];W[cl];B[dl];W[cj];B[bk];W[el]
;B[dj];W[dm]
(;B[bl];W[dn];B[ce]LB[fb:A]C[[NM\] I wanted to keep the corner territory, black group on the side is almost quite strong

[NM\] this will weaken the group on the side but I think that is OK

[Nexik\]If want to defend corner and not harm your group on the left you should just play at A]
;W[cf];B[cd];W[ch];B[ci];W[bi];B[bg]C[[NM\] to destroy white shape and get sente, good?

[Nexik\]Very bad idea, you are making white stronger and your group weaker and weaker]
;W[bh];B[bj];W[bf];B[fk]LB[bm:A][fi:B][eb:C]C[[NM\] another move to destroy white shape, good?

[Nexik\] White has tesuji at A so he is very strong. You are still attacking white and don't think about your weakness at all. Now white B is very severe. Also white can play at C a first almost kill you corner]
;W[ek];B[fi]C[[Nexik\]White fixed your mistake here];W[fj];B[gj]
;W[ej];B[ei]C[[Nexik\] Now situation is even. Black can start real fight]
;W[gi];B[dg]
(;W[df];B[gh]C[[NM\] I was not sure what to play here, this is playing from behind but G10 stone helps.

[NM\]what would you play?];W[hi];B[hh]
(;W[eg]C[[NM\] i expected white to extend at j11

[Nexik\]Another white mistake];B[ii];W[hj];B[dh]C[[NM\] mybe push again at j10

[NM\] i was thinking about J9 but decided against it

[Nexik\]Good move made your group alive];W[ih]C[[Nexik\] Mistake]

(;B[ij]C[[Nexik\]Better to leave this aji for later];W[hk];B[ik]
;W[gk];B[cg]C[[NM\] so the last few moves seems bad for white]
;W[fg]C[[Nexik\]Mistake this move is not doing anything worth]

(;B[gf]C[[Nexik\] Mistake, Black have chance to settle situation with F18]
;W[eb]C[[NM\] I did not expect this move
[NM\] instead of G14, i should play F17 instead?];B[ec];W[fc]
;B[db];W[fb];B[ed]C[[Nexik\] pushing this way is really bad]
;W[ee];B[bc]
(;W[fe]
(;B[be]C[[Nexik\] This is not needed];W[jd]C[[NM\] Some time pressure here so i decide to play solid shape moves

[NM\] perhaps i should play p17
[NM\] or L5 to help the 3 stone in the middle and make the bottom group stronger

[Nexik\]Black is leading. It is the best to play very simple game now without complications]

(;B[if];W[jh]
(;B[id];W[ic];B[kf];W[kc];B[oc];W[kg];B[hd];W[hc];B[ke]LB[lf:A]
C[[Nexik\]Better to extend at A]
(;W[kj]C[[Nexik\]Wrong direction of play];B[qi]C[[NM\] I counted about here and black is well ahead.

[NM\] This seems a very big point now and nothing seems very urgent

[NM\] I decide to give up j9 stones as they were forcing moves]
;W[qf]
(;B[ql]C[[NM\] lots of options here

[NM\] p14, p11, q13

[NM\] r8 takes aim at black s2

[NM\] I'd like some help here as white made the game difficult and i should have an easy win

[NM\] so i should attack r14 instead with q13 as i am attacking from weak to strong side and push towards my thickness ?

[Nexik\]This is proper move];W[of]LB[oi:A][fh:B]C[[Nexik\] Black should play A now (P11) and then connect at B (F12)]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[mh]C[[NM\] i wanted to lean on the middle stones but i ended up getting bad shape]
;W[mg];B[lf];W[mf];B[li];W[kh];B[mi];W[jj];B[me]C[[NM\] this gives white good shape so mybe bad?]
;W[ne]
(;B[nd];W[md];B[le];W[od];B[nc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[pe];W[oe]
;B[rd];W[oh];B[pg]C[[NM\] mybe not good, white should play q12 now?]
;W[og];B[qg];W[pf];B[pi]C[[NM\] i wanted to keep the option of connecting under at s14]
;W[nj];B[lk];W[kl];B[mk]C[[NM\] this seems slow and makes the game difficult for me, i've obviously played something not right

[NM\] trying to keep game simple since ahead, did not want to fight like this]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[pl];B[oi];W[nh];B[ni]C[[NM\] q9 first then if white plays q7 then connect at o11?

[Nexik\] Q9 is a lot better];W[mc];B[mb];W[lb];B[fh];W[om]
(;B[im]C[[NM\] not sure if I should try pulling stones out at j11

[NM\] or play l6? to give up stones and get easy win];W[jl]

;B[gp]C[[NM\] if i lose this ko i could lose the game

[NM\] i try to ensure connection

[NM\] or threaten kill stones at bottom but i think it is too late to do that]

;W[jg];B[ld];W[mn];B[lp];W[jq];B[mm];W[md];B[mc];W[mn];B[hp]
C[[NM\] decide to play safe, i dont think i could win the ko

[NM\] how could i play the ko better?

[Nexik\]Playing ko in the first place was wrong. You have problem to starting fight in every posiblle place. You should play more safe and think what fight will give you instead of blindly attacking.]

;W[rl];B[rk];W[jm];B[pk]C[[NM\] OK, so just endgame now
[NM\] i did win in the end

[NM\] but i would like help with the comments i've made in the game

[NM\] there is still lots i could have done better i'm sure

[NM\] any help would be much appreciated!
