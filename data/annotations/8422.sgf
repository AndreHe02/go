Michael: Hi there Mister Reviewer Guy.  My name is Michael and I'm still not so good at this go thing.

I was hoping to get some insight to this game.  I spent most of the game fighting off attacks and barely surviving and then dying.  I eventually resigned.  I think I was being more aggresive than I should have been and it cost me quite a bit.

I'm also bad at endgame and counting and keeping sente and all of that.  I felt like I had gote for most of the game and I was hoping you could help me find the important moves.

I went ahead and reviewed the game myself.  I hope you don't mind.  Feel free to comment wherever.  I'm sure I missed things.]

Michael: After reviewing the game for myself, I thought this move was a bit questionable.


I can't say that this move is wrong, since a white approach here is big, but I think you're rigth that taking the bottom corner is bigger.]

Michael: 5-4 josekis are weird...


Sure, just remember that like with the 33, you want to invade at a time when you don't mind giving white influence]

Michael: White's wall is less effective because of the marked stone?  That was my theory...

Unfortuteanetly, I think it's more accurate to say that white's wall is effective because it attacks your low stone.]

Michael: This move seems questionable, was there a better way?  Or is L16 simply in the wrong spot?


This move is bad because it isn't a direct response to the attachment. Hane at m17 is probably best.]

In any position like this, the cut at K 17 is a must, and should be an automatic response. Extending like this lets white connect and wrecks your shape.]

Michael: And I failed to kill it. :/  It was probably a mistake to try to kill it, I should have just kept it contained.  I didn't gain much in the way of territory or power trying either.  How would you have played that out?

You still have that group in the middle, which is looking very weak. See earlier variation for a suggestion on how to attack better.]

Michael: I think I tried too hard to keep the groups seperated.  They were both alive, and there's little territory in this area.

Good analysis. It's close, but big engame moves like P18 would help enormously]

Michael:  This move took me completely by surprise.  Even though in retrospect it seems to obvious.  Black seems to be able to live at this point, but I didn't see it at the time.


This is nice sente for white, but I think you should be fine. See variation.]

From here on in, I'm just postponing the inevitable.


It's true that the game is lost by this point, but ko trheats like M4 are probably better.]

Michael: White is about 30 points ahead by my counting now.  The sad thing is it would be about even if the bottom corner had lived.

Thank you very much for taking the time to review my game.


A nice game. You definately had some chances to win, and I think a better execution of the attack on white's two weak groups could have made the difference. Failing that, living in the bottom right might have been good enough.

For the future, just remember that after a hane like happened after the attachment on the top side, cutting is almost always correct!]
