C[Dear reviewer, thanks for taking the time to review this game.  I played black as "DeadAgain" on KGS.  I'm mostly interested in hearing how you would evaluate positions rather than just specific move suggestions, but of course both are good.  It was a fairly close game so I'd appreciate suggestions for how to improve the endgame as well.  Feel free to ignore any variations I added, although they might help to show what I was thinking.

-Carl Gay

Jay: I am glad to help. I ignored most of your variations, and focused on commenting the game moves.  I commented for both sides.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[dp];W[oc];B[pp];W[cn]LB[qn:A]TR[qd][pp]SQ[oc]
[dd]C[Jay: Approaching LR corner at A is normal for W.  This approach forms a less desired pattern for W: While the other four marked stones are positioned symmetrically, then B D4 stone exchanging W C6 stone favors B forcing W's low position.]
;B[dk]C[Jay: This move is to develop toward the center.  But, it may not be effective while facing a high stone at D16.   But, I sense that B is looking for fight to start with. So, this may just be the style.]

(;W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: I played around with d3 in the variation, and I think it would be better in this situation.  Is it generally better when I have a stone on q4?

Jay: This is ok, but a bit slow for B.];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo]
;W[bq];B[co];W[fq]
(;B[go]LB[bk:B][el:D][bn:A][en:C]C[Jay: The standard joseki move is D6.  After this move, B's D9 stone is better placed at C9.  The current position leaves lots of aji by some combination of A, B, C, D,etc. 

This last move can also press at F4. 
See the variations.];W[pf]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: I think this was a bad choice of joseki for white, given that I have a ladder-breaker at g5.  (Not that I would have been able to read that far myself.)

Jay: Not sure what W wants to achieve by this move.  Usually such move is made when there is a big potential on the upper side, say having a stone at K16, or the right side.  It's still better to appoach the LR corner from R6.  Unless W wants to make a complicated ladder here to plan to bring out C6 stone.]
;B[od]
(;W[pd]C[Jay: This wedge is not too good for W.  See variation.]
;B[pe];W[pc];B[oe];W[qe];B[qf];W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[pg]
(;W[nq]C[Jay: This approach feels arkward. This stone and the left corner are both low.  See the variation.]
;B[pn];W[ql]LB[qj:A][rn:E][mo:C][no:B][lq:D]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: I suspect this is where the game turned in white's favor.  Was there a better way to handle this move, and the subsequent invasion of r3?

I only considered A, B, C, and D during the game.  I chose A because it seemed like the strongest move to attack the r8 stone, but now I wonder if E would've been better.  It takes away a base for the r8 stone and protects the corner.  But it too has problems (see variation).

What is the best way to evaluate this position?

Jay: This is an interesting situation. In my view W's this move is a overplay if not a desperate attack. The standard local joseki is to to play P6 first followed by attacking the O3 stone. See variation.]

(;B[qj];W[ol]
(;B[mo]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: I prefer the variation, pincer at m3.

Jay: This move is not good for B.];W[ml]
(;B[lp]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: Could I do better than this here?

Jay: Given the previous move, this is ok. This leaves some breathing for W's O3 stone. But, it prepares the attack the three stones on the right.]
;W[qq]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: What is the best way to attack the p8 group at this point?  Perhaps just p10 to threaten a cut?

Jay: What you did in the game is ok.]
(;B[pq];W[pr]
(;B[qp];W[rr];B[rq];W[qr];B[kl];W[lk]
(;B[of]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: Maybe white's choice of joseki wasn't so bad, since the ladder-breaker was a big move.

Jay: B needn't rush to capture this stone. See variation.];W[kk]

(;B[cf]TR[kk][lk][ml][ol][ql]SQ[go]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: This obviously allows for an invasion later, but white never did.  I think he could've punished me more for this.  Can you help me evaluate my options in this position?

Jay: This move is not very interesting.  The problem is the marked G5 move made much earlier.  It left too much aji.  Given the situation B's thinking has to center around attacking the marked W stones in the center, because B has given away lots of cash already.  Now it time for B to gain profit in the center by attacking these stone.  

The difficult question is how to continue the attack.  The way of appraoch in the game perfectly helped W to build a base on the top side, that eventually will make attack ineffective.  So, B should approach from the other side.  

See variation.];W[fc];B[nc]
(;W[nb]C[Jay: This crawling along 2nd line is not good.  See variation.]

(;B[mc];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb]C[Jay: These few W's moves are very bad.  B is getting some advantage back.]
;B[kc]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: This seemed big, but clearly isn't sente.  Suggestions?

Jay: This is very good for B to continue press along the 3rd line.  Now attacking the center W stones is very promising.]
;W[ce];B[df]C[Jay: W is further handing over the lead by doing bad exchange.  This exchange made the left side solid, and further endangered the center group.]
;W[bf]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: This seemed like a "thankyou" move.  Thanks for making me fix my weakness.

Jay: Yes, W made several "thank you" moves already.];B[bg];W[gq]
C[Jay: This again is very slow on the 3rd line.  Everything is flat on the bottom.  Nothing is interesting here.  Don't know what W is thinking. Another thank you move.]
;B[jl]C[Jay: Good!];W[jk];B[nk];W[nl]
(;B[be]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: I thought this would be sente with the invasion at C17 threatened, but I see now that with the small knights extension at F17 the invasion doesn't work.  I guess this is something I should just know by now.  Sigh.  J9 biggest here?

Jay: This move is small and gote.  Attacking the W center group is urgent.  Both J9 or M11 is good starting move.  I would prefer M11.]

;W[gi];B[ei]TR[gi][fk]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: A16 bigger, I guess.

Jay: This move is pretty big.  The problem is the previous move.  Now you have a strong formation in the very strong area.  Not needed.  The exchange as marked much favors W.]
;W[ad]
(;B[kg]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: This looked big, but was there a better way to attack the center?  (k4 looks important too, or perhaps j2)

Jay: The center is quite strong now.  But, this is a good move.]
;W[jg];B[jf]C[Jay: This is dangerous.]
(;W[kf]C[Jay: W has a good chance here.  See variation.];B[lg]
;W[je];B[if];W[kd]C[DeadAgain [5k\]: This was a nice move. Was there a good way to punish it?

Jay: There is no good way to punish it if it's good. The problem is that these few W moves didn't help the center group at all, only weakened it.]

(;B[ig];W[jc];B[jh]C[Jay: Now the center group is in danger. By attacking it B will gain profits if not a clean kill.]
