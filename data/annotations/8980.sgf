_______________________________________________________________________________________

Hello Guys! My name is David and I will be reviewing this game today. If there is text at any point throughout this game, I will separate the commentry with a line (like above)]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[fp]CR[cn][dn]SQ[ip][hq]C[This reply from white is certainly playable, though not as common as a pincer (square points) or an extension (circle points).]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[jq]
(;W[go]C[White doesn't need to trade this move off immediately. It isn't immediately certain that having the extra influence will be better than retaining ko threats or other potential in this area. White shouldn't be too concerned with black pushing up either at this point in the game, as that would make his K3 stone a bit too close to the wall that black would get (see continuation).]
;B[hp]C[Now black's group is solid and has little aji for white to exploit.]
;W[cm]TR[cn]C[This move makes a thinner shape compared to usual solid move at C6. There is more potential for black (and it becomes somewhat relevent in later in the game), and white doesn't secure many more points than if he played C6.]
;B[fc]C[Right direction for black];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc]
;B[jc];W[cg]TR[df]C[Maybe D14 is better in this case for white for better balance and coordination with the bottom side.]
;B[pj]C[This opening is a success for black. White only has stones on one side of the board while black gets to develop on three sides.]
(;W[qn]C[Right idea. White needs to break into black's sphere of influence before black expands it even more.]
;B[qo];W[pn]
(;B[nq]TR[np]C[Black doesn't need to play low here. O4 has better relation to the position on the bottom (the K3 stone) and applies more pressure on the two white stones.]
;W[qq]TR[rj][pl]C[White can't come into the corner so early here. Black replies properly with S5 and white's two stones on the outside are stranded. Remember that white's purpose with the approach is to break up black's framework. So black is okay with letting white live in the corner to take the outside.

White needs to try and settle his stones on the outside with a move like Q8 or S10]
;B[ro]C[Correct reply by black: cutting off the two white groups is good.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[or]C[This move doesn't let white live. Black can kill by sliding into T2, but right now black's shape is thin on the outside, and white would get a lot of moves to help the two stones escape. (see continuation).]
(;B[ql]
(;W[rn]C[This descend is very bad for white. Black connecting underneath is worth very few points, and there is no value in separating black's groups as they are both strong groups. White's only concern right now is to run away. with his group]
;B[nn]C[Good capping response from black. White's window of getting into the center are decreasing.]
;W[pl]C[This attachment is a good move to help white get out into the center.]
;B[pk];W[ol]
(;B[nj]C[This move lets black build up a big moyo.];W[ml]
(;B[ln]C[This move pushes white from the wrong direction.];W[kl]
;B[lj]C[Now white has time to invade the top side, since black has no good way to severely attack the white group even if white tenukis.]
(;W[jo]C[This move needs to do something about this top right. The bottom area is mostly settled and is small. Black can ignore this move and secure his territory at the top.]
(;B[kp]C[Black doesn't need to continue here. Blocking white at O2 is sente against the corner, so black's stones are settled, and the side territory is secure.]
;W[ko];B[lo];W[jm]C[This move is also slow. White can still take the time now to do something about the top right.]
(;B[ll]C[This cut doesn't work very well for black. Instead of continuing here, black can take the time to secure the corner at th top right.]
;W[lk];B[lm];W[mk];B[mj];W[kj]C[Black has not gained anything, but white has secure his connection and got to play L10. If we examine the position before black forced the cut, L10 was not possible for white.]
(;B[jk]C[This peep is a misplay be black. White doesnt not need to connect directly.]
(;W[kk]C[White's connection here is passive.];B[hf]TR[qd]SQ[kh]
C[Black should secure the corner instead with a move like R16. It is hard to build up a big moyo in the center, since white got the L10 stone can can jump to L12 comfortable.]
(;W[qf]TR[qc]C[White should just come into the corner directly. No matter which way black blocks, his potential on the outside is limited because white can jump to L12]
;B[qe]C[Good response. Make white heavy.];W[pf];B[nc]C[Again, this move should be at O16]
;W[qc]C[White makes the mistake of coming into the corner instead of helping the two stones on the outside.]
;B[re];W[pc];B[od];W[ob]C[See the comments made regarding this shape when it was played at the bottom]
(;B[nb];W[rc]
(;B[nr]C[This move is a misplay. Black can kill the corner outright by sliding in at T2]
(;W[rq]C[White can't reply in the corner now. White has to keep reducing the moyo at the top.]
;B[nf]C[After this move, it is very hard for white to move the stones out.]
;W[oi]
(;B[oj]C[Actually black has a stronger reply to this peep.]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[ph]
(;B[oh]C[This move doesn't kill white completely.];W[og];B[nh]
(;W[qh]
(;B[rg]C[This move is a misplay. Black needs to play at S10.]
(;W[rf];B[sf]
(;W[rh]
(;B[sg];W[rk];B[qk];W[rl];B[qg];W[pg];B[ng];W[se]C[This throw-in is bad for white.]
;B[sd];W[sh];B[se]TR[sd]C[Because black has the marked stone (T16), he can do things against the corner now.]
(;W[rm]C[This connection is unnecessary. If black pushes at R7, white connnects at S7 and lives.]
(;B[in]TR[hi]C[White's stones in the center are connected to the living Q6 stones. White can cut black off and black will have to run away to save the J6 stone.

Black has other ways of reducing white's center potential (eg, at , around H11) since the aji around this area and in the corner around D5 will be white's concern.]
(;W[jj]C[White letting black connect connect is bad, since now white's influence is disrupted without much compensation. Also, now that black has some more stones in the center he can invade deeper into the left side.]
;B[hn]TR[jo][ko]C[White can consider sacrificing the two stones to expand the left side.]
(;W[km];B[hl]C[Actually black's shape right now isn't solid. White can cut black.]
(;W[jg];B[kf]C[Black doesn't need to reply here, as he doesn't make many more points here in the center. Black should fix his shape at the bottom.]
;W[jf];B[je];W[kg];B[lf];W[ge];B[hd];W[he];B[ie];W[if];B[hj]
C[White can cut black now and black will be in a tough spot.]
(;W[hg];B[dh]SQ[ip]C[Black cannot ignore the weakness at the bottom.]
(;W[ch]C[White should not answer weakly here.];B[di];W[ci];B[dj]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[ck];B[fh]C[These exchanges were very good for black, as he even gets to make a few points in the center and no longer needs to worry about the cut at the bottom.]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[de];B[gf];W[gg];B[oc];W[pa]
(;B[sb];W[sc];B[qb];W[rb];B[ra];W[qa];B[na];W[pb];B[oq];W[ps]
;B[ns];W[rs];B[pe]C[White can ignore this move, as the white group on the side is already alive. Black has around 65 points (35 at the top, 25 at the bottom, and a few in the center) while white has almost 70 on board (15 between the 3 groups on the right and roughly 50 on the left). If white playss the big endgame moves now, he should secure an easy victory.]
(;W[rj];B[dr];W[cr];B[er];W[cs];B[db];W[cb];B[eb]C[Black got to play both of these hanes. The difference is more than 5 points.]

;W[en];B[ca]C[Black gets to play this big endgame move as well.]
;W[bb];B[sn];W[sm];B[so];W[qj]TR[rj]C[White has spent two unnecessary moves on this group. Even if black can the area on the right to one eye, white is still connected to the center. White can play a move like B19 instead.]
;B[fn]
(;W[gn];B[eo];W[ep];B[dn];W[cn];B[gm];W[do];B[en]C[Black gained 3 points due to white's misplay.]
;W[im]C[Black does not need to answer this. Black's group is alive in the center, and the bottom is in no danger.]
;B[hm];W[ds];B[es]
(;W[cq]C[White does not need this connection.];B[nm]C[White can play in another area right now. the two stones can connect to the group on the right or the group on the left.]

(;W[pm];B[oo];W[mm];B[mn];W[gh];B[ed];W[ee];B[gb];W[da]C[This throw-in makes the block at b19 worth fewer points.]

________________________________________________________________________________________
Black missed many opportunities throughout the game and white missed a few. Black was punished more for his mistakes though, as white had a clear lead going into the endgame stages.. Other than reading errors throughout the mid-game, white played many moves in the endgame that were too cautious and let black almost catch up in the endgame.

Hope you guys enjoyed this review.])
