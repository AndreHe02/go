C[Hello there,

I'll do my best to review this game for you.

I hope it helps.

Wolfy (9k kgs)];B[qp]C[Dear reviewer.
I think I played quite bad most of the game, but had some good momments aspecially with invations. I sekrifieced to many stones & died alot.

I would be glad if U wont use marks and use the cordinates to explain, otherwise there's a chance I won't be able to view it.
(I played B)

I THANK YOU VERY MUCH in advance for your comments.];W[cd];B[dp]
;W[qd];B[oc];W[pf]
(;B[pe]C[This move (Q15) is dangerous for you, because it allows white to cut your stones easily.

The most basic responses to white Q14 would be either R17or M17 (see these moves for explanation)]

;W[qe];B[ne];W[pb];B[ob];W[ec]
(;B[nf]C[(I tried to prepare to invade center-right or center-top)

This move (O14) is a bit small seeing as how white just played E16.  Normally I'd play a move like C10 to counter white's corner enclosure.  

O14 is a nice local move, but this early in the game you need to work with the whole board first.  Always ask yourself "is this move bigger than playing elsewhere"]
;W[pg];B[jd];W[hc]C[After white plays here you can see that white is starting to make a big corner with decent chance at getting influence.  Maybe a play near somewhere in C10 to C13 area]

(;B[ic];W[cj];B[cg]C[(critic mistake?)

This seems alright.. C13 still has room to run to black stones on the top.]
;W[cn]
(;B[co]C[(I want to understand better what went wrong in the lower-left)

Playing a contact like move like C5 works best if you have a stone near the D10 star point  If your opponent has a stone there, you're helping them and pretty much hurting your self with a contact move.]

(;B[ek];W[fl];B[fj];W[ep]C[with your corner under attack, you have to choose whether to participate in the ko battle or not.]

(;B[fp]C[I was affraid that if I'll go to  D5 W will enclose me in the corner & kill.]
;W[do];B[eq];W[gp]C[Capturing might give you more leverage here.]

(;B[fq];W[dq]C[Here, just take the ko early.  It will help you retain the bottom or at least have a better fighting chance.]

(;B[cp]C[You're very heavy here.. Two heavy groups with no eyes that are split and heavily reliant on a ko.  Bad news for you :(]
;W[dr]C[Still, at this point, take the ko.]
(;B[er]C[(very bed, what was I supposed to do here?)

Take the ko.. youd have a better chance.

With E2, you made an empty triangle shape (E2, E3, F3)  This shape is very inefficient and you should avoid it unless it's the endgame, or you read out a good sequence from it.]
;W[gq];B[ds];W[fr];B[eo];W[ej]
(;B[fk]C[At this point, the corner is bigger than losing E9 groups.  Best take the ko and fill it.]

;W[rf];B[qg];W[qh];B[rg];W[rh];B[re];W[sg]C[(was it better for W to play S16?)

Capturing would have been better for white.];B[rd];W[se]C[(W's mistake?)

This seems a bit small, really  White could have done more damage by playing O13 or P7, which would help in increasing her large side territory.]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[qe]C[No need to protect R14 here.. the corner is alive.. You should worry about your weaker groups.  Or maybe save H13.  Cutting at G15 may yield good outcomes.]

(;B[jl];W[jm];B[km];W[jn];B[hn]C[(that, I think, was a very well planned attack.)

As you can see, white's wall here had weaknesses because it consisted of 2-segment groups stepping out.white needed to protect the cut at K4, rather than saving a small stone.]

(;W[gm];B[jo];W[il];B[io];W[im];B[lp];W[kp];B[lq];W[mr]C[White's greed allowed you to break right through his wall. Good job.]

(;B[jq];W[pp]C[(WHAT HAPPENED HERE?)

Black R4 was weak and touching a strong white group.  It is bound to die.  Best to let it die rather than saving it.]

;B[oh];W[id];B[jc];W[fe];B[ee]C[(was there a way to live here with territory?)

White as too many stones int he upper left.  The best you can do is extend little branches of stones away from F13, since it connects to the center.  This will reduce white's territory.]

(;B[lc]C[M17 is a solid move forming a good base for life.

It's a peaceful move that doesn't attack white and keeps your P17 stone from becoming separated or weak.

Doing a two point jump is normally a good idea if all you have is a single stone.  

* The normal rule of thumb for jumps is "size of wall" + 1]
