C[guest69 [-\]: DT (Daniel TomÃ© - my name) - first of all, thx for the review. I have some questions about a joseki that appeared on this game.
guest69 [-\]: My group got killed, so any advices about Life&death problems are welcome.
guest69 [-\]: Please, focus your comment on my biggest mistakes (I'm Black). Any comments about finding last chances instead of resigning, direction of play and peaceful josekis are welcome too :)



* Hi
I'm mafutrct, kgs 1d, your reviewer. If you're interested, i have a senseis page:

(;B[cc]C[* One note on this move. Black just started one of the most complex joseki ever. Unless you really know what you're doing, i do not recomment this move at all. For any kyu level player, a simple variation gives an equal or better result than starting a huge gamle with C17. It is completely impossible to read this joseki so if any player deviaties, the result is more or less random.]

(;W[ei];B[ck];W[md]C[* I think this is a bit off. Since C12 is stable now, black can aim to split the 2 white groups. Black will not kill anything, but he can hope to make his group alive in the process.]

guest69 [-\]: If you want, please tell me some books that you think i should read, based on my mistakes in this game. Thanks again!



* This game was finally decided in yose, but there were many opportunities for white to win earlier. This had to be expected after black's mistake at F19.

* I recommend (as i always do) www.goproblems.com

* I think every book can be helpful for these players. I liked to read Elementary Go Series. An extremely good book for every player approaching dan level is Lessons in the fundamentals of Go by Kageyama.

* Have a look at the numerous audio and text lessons on KGS. I may recommend the lesson archive at http://senseis.xmp.net/?Recorder  O:-)

* I hope my comments were understandable and helpful. I'm very weak, so please be patient in case i made some stupid mistakes or missed something. ;>

* Thank you and have a nice day ^__^])
