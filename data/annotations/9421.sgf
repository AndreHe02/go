I don't know if I would have resigned here. You are not that far behind in totally secure territory.

I would advise you to try to play more calmly. Moyos will almost always be invaded or reduced sucessfully. There are too many standard invasion shape points like S4 and M17 to hope to take everything. Try to invite white to invade at these points, and make profit (such as territory elsewhere, or reducing white territory) by attacking.

J9 was big for white, probably the result of choosing C5 instead of C6. I would have focused on reducing the D11 area before white has a chance to enclose it.

Also, please remember that I am not very strong, and my comments are not perfect.

Cheers,
