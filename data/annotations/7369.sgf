C[[EV\] This was a good game to review, with no huge mistakes, and some interesting moves.   W deserved the win, but both sides had good chances throughout the game.  I hope you find my comments helpful.]

[nd:j]C[[EV\] This is the first move I dislike.  After the joseki in the lower right, the W stone at O3 limits both players possible territory along the bottom side, so a B extension in this direction is not very large.  I prefer any of the labeled choices A-J.]
;W[cq]C[Is the immediate invasion reasonable?

[EV\] It is perhaps a bit early, and I think B gets a slightly better result if he blocks on the correct side.  However, I think this move is playable.]

(;B[cp]C[[EV\] I think B should block on the other side (see variation).  The general rule is to block on the side with the farthest extension, to stake out the largest territory.  Here, B has only one direction to make territory.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[ep];B[fq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn]
;W[dr];B[fo]C[[EV\] This result looks even.  B gets a lot of thickness, but the W stone at C10 is well placed to counteract the thickness.]
;W[cg]C[[EV\] Good, the only move.];B[fd]LB[hc:B][bd:A]C[I think black should play third line.

[EV\] Agree.  The B formation now faces a direction where B has little chance of making territory or attacking.

Should white possibly play A or B now?

[EV\] Both are possible and good.  A conservative player would choose A, while a fighter would choose B.  Waiting is also fine, treating them as miai.]
;W[qg];B[qe]C[I don't know how white should answer.

[EV\] B could simply extend to P11 (the standard side joseki continuation), preparing to invade here if W failed to defend.  But this direct invasion looks playable and interesting.

[EV\] The simplest response for W is probably to secure the corner, as in the game, except I prefer P16 over P17, making more territory.]
;W[oc];B[oe];W[md]
(;B[pg]C[[EV\] This move is a little awkward, but B has no way to capture R13 cleanly.  One idea which leaves less aji is shown in the variation, but W may not cooperate.]
;W[ql];B[rm];W[hc];B[jc]C[This move seems too agressive.

[EV\] This starts a difficult fight.  However, playing submissively in the corner is not appealing, so this move may be necessary.]
;W[he];B[je];W[fb]C[[EV\] Could W go all out and take the corner with C17 instead? I think I like that idea better than making only a partial base on the side and allowing B to make a base in the corner.]
;B[cc]C[[EV\] With a secure base in the corner, the fight now looks reasonable for B.]
;W[ec];B[df];W[ce]C[Is this a good move?];B[cf];W[bf];B[de]
;W[bd];B[dg];W[ch]
(;B[gg]C[[EV\] H13 would be a more positive, stronger attack, but I have no idea if it works (see variation).]
;W[hg]C[[EV\] Good.];B[me]C[[EV\] B should not push W in the direction which helps W attack his weak stones.  This sort of push is good if B can connect, but W should not allow that.]
;W[gh];B[fh];W[gf];B[fg]
(;W[le];B[nd]LB[mc:A]C[How about white A here?
 [EV\] Yes, it looks like that would keep B disconnected.];W[nc]
;B[ld];W[mc];B[lf]C[[EV\] B outplayed W here and ended up with a good result.]
;W[gi];B[ej];W[gk];B[dj];W[ck];B[el]C[[EV\] Given that B must play here to connect, could B omit the D10-C9 exchange?  That exchange hurts B territory.]

(;W[rj]LB[pj:a][oj:b][ok:c][lj:d]C[I was unsure what to do now. I finally decided on this move, but it feels like there are better moves.

[EV\] When unsure what direction to play, pause and count the score.  By my rough count, B has 0 (upper left) + 18 (lower left) + unknown (right side).  W has 10 (left side) + 8 (lower left) + 10 (lower right) + 16 (upper right) + komi.  So it looks like W needs to limit B to 30 points on the right side.  The W game move will certainly do this if it lives, so B will have to try to kill.  W could probably play a milder reducing move and win with less risk.  A few possibilities are marked ABC.  If you trust your counting and yose skill, a move like D is even worth considering (see variation).]

(;B[ri]C[[EV\] This move does not work in the regular joseki, allowing W to break the side.  Here it also looks too easy on W.]
;W[ok]C[[EV\] Now it looks like W will escape and win.];B[pl]
;W[pk];B[qj];W[qk];C[subsequent moves omitted. w+])
(;B[pk]C[[EV\] This is the standard joseki move, shown earlier, and it looks like a strong attack.]
;W[pj];B[qj];W[qk];B[pl];W[ri];B[qh];W[rh];B[rg]C[[EV\] There are many other possibilities besides this failure, so W may find some way to live, but the situation looks very risky.]

;W[on];B[pn];W[rd];B[re]C[[EV\] This is just meant to illustrate the result -- dont pay attention to the order of moves or the details.  W lets B consolidate more than 30 points on the right side, but gets quite a bit of center territory in return, and has no worries about the H13 group.  This looks like a win for W.]
))
(;W[ld]C[[EV\] If W just plays here, can B connect?]))
(;B[hg];W[if];B[jh];W[jf];B[le]C[[EV\] One possible continuation after H13.]
))
(;B[rc];W[rb];B[qd];W[pc];B[ph]C[[EV\] This corner exchange allows B to capture with little remaining aji, but W has ways to resist if he wants to fight.  The endgame capture at S16 is very large.]
))
(;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm]C[[EV\] Blocking this way looks better for B.  The extension to G3 is too narrow, but at least B gets territory, and the W stone at C10 looks misplaced.]

(;B[jc]C[Is this better?

[EV\] Yes, I think so.]))
(;W[qg]C[How about this move?

[EV\] This move would be OK, but I prefer playing in a more wide open area, like the actual game move.  Continuing ....]

(;B[dj];W[ql];B[rm]C[Is this ok for white?

[EV\] This starts a standard middle-game joseki (see continuation) which is covered in joseki books.  B comes out OK locally, and has three unanswered moves on the other side of the board, so I prefer the W play in the actual game.]
;W[rj];B[pk];W[pj];B[qj];W[qk];B[ok];W[ri];B[op];W[oq]C[W is certainly better on the right side of the board, but perhaps not by three full moves.]
)
(;B[oi];W[cj];B[qe]C[How should white handle this invasion?

[EV\] Because of this possibility, W does not really gain anything from the R13-P11 exchange, without adding another move.

[EV\] In answer to your question, if the game proceeded this way, W has a couple of options -- treat the R13 stone as a sacrifice to build the corner, or connect under R15.  See variations.]
