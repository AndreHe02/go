AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[[Calvin\] Thank you for submitting your game for review.  I enjoyed going through it.  Remember that I am also a weak player, so take everything with a grain of salt.  In particular, some of my reading may be off.

I suspect this may have been a psychological defeat for black after white's tricky-looking invasion at move 9 (R6).  A four-stone handicap at this level is not large, and a few slow moves can put black behind quickly.]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[[Calvin\] I prefer a pincer, but of couse this is fine.]
;W[fc];B[cf]C[[Calvin\] Territorial style for black.  It is not my preference in handicap games, but it is playable.]
;W[jd]MA[hc][lc]C[[Calvin\] There are two good places to invade white later, so white's top is not as large as it seems.]

(;B[pj]C[[Calvin\] I prefer K4.];W[nq]
(;B[on]C[In retrospect this is the big mistake I can identify myself. I thought it would work well with Q10 but as my opponents next move shows it didnt work out that great.

[Calvin\] It's an unusual move, and if you play it you have to be ready for a white invasion.  See variations.]
;W[qn]C[[Calvin\] The invasion may be a little early for white, but it is a handicap game, so white has to try something.  This is a normal spot for white to target as R6 would have been a good move for black.   Black cannot expect to kill this stone.  Some joseki dictionaries call this a trick move and suggest R3 as the best response, but since Q10 is already there, other options are possible.]

(;B[po]C[Here I am also confused as to what to do. Just tried to make myself stronger.

[Calvin\] A move like this certainly prevents black from being cut and does not help white, but it feels forced and timid.  This was a 3 to 1 position with black to move, so I think it's way too slow.  Remember that white's two stones don't have a base yet.  See variations for other ideas.  Just the 3-3 point (3-3) is always okay and is listed as the answer to R6 in some joseki dictionaries that consider R6 a trick play.]
;W[rp]
(;B[pq]C[[Calvin\] Slow.  White already can't connect.];W[ql]

(;B[lq]C[Here I felt that I should be able to create something to the left of my wall.

[Calvin\] Yes, but it's too close to white.   White will give up the stone.   See variation.]
;W[jq]
(;B[lo]C[And I thought that this move should continue that but the connection underneath for white made that moot.

[Calvin\] N4 would have captured the white stone, but that's too small a componsenation.  See variation.]

;W[mo]
(;B[oq]MA[jp]C[[Calvin\] Unnecessary.  Black must cut now at K4.]
;W[jo];B[mn]C[[Calvin\] I don't understand the aim of this move.  In any case, it is gote, and the result is good for white.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[gp];B[gq];W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[[Calvin\] This is too easy on white and makes black small and overconcentrated.  Look at the split instead.  See variation.]
;W[cp]
(;B[cr]C[[Calvin\] I think I'd prefer the shape move at D5 directly to start moving out rather that seeking more of a base here.]
;W[br];B[dr];W[do];B[eo];W[en]C[[Calvin\] So painful for black!]
;B[fo];W[ln];B[ip];W[io];B[hq];W[jp];B[fp]C[[Calvin\] Gote.]
;W[ci]
(;B[dc]C[[Calvin\] It's big, but maybe black needs to try something.  I'd prefer to invade at H17.]
;W[fe];B[ef]C[[Calvin\] Maybe black does not want to get sealed in, but the corner is pretty solid now, and this looks slow rather than urgent.]
;W[pb]C[[Calvin\] Clearly this move is bigger than black's previous one.]
;B[qc];W[rj];B[qi];W[ol]
(;B[rq]LB[lm:A]C[[Calvin\] This move ends in gote.  The atari at A (M7) might be better timing so that white doesn't seal black in.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[mm];B[nn]C[[Calvin\] Too small to connect.  This is just one stone.]
;W[nk]C[[Calvin\] But I guess if white treated it as sente...]
;B[ne];W[lc];B[ni];W[pg]SQ[rj]C[This stone felt like it should not be allowed to live, is that a correct feeling? =)

[Calvin\] I think white is trying to either run out or make a threat to connect to the marked stone a bigger endgame move.]

(;B[og]C[[Calvin\] Playing this close helps white.];W[of]C[[Calvin\] Now this becomes a useful forcing move for white.]

(;B[ng]C[[Calvin\] Black may have to cut instead.];W[qg]C[[Calvin\] After this, black makes some reading mistakes.]
;B[qh];W[qe];B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[ph];B[pi];W[ri]
(;B[oh]C[[Calvin\] Q14 instead.];W[pf];B[pe];W[nf];B[mg];W[mf]
;B[lg];W[ei]MA[po][pq][lq][dp][og][mn][oq]C[[Calvin\] At this point I think white has caught up.

In summary, black played two very slow moves early on (R5 and Q3), attacked a single stone too closely at M3, missed an important cut at K4 by playing an unneeded defense at P3, and chose the wrong direction to block at D4.  The move at N6 did not have a clear aim.

After this, much of the early handicap advantage was erased.  Touching white's placement at P13 and some later reading errors put the game close at which point white is simply the stronger player and can be expected to gain in the endgame.

The unusual move at P6 is not a game-losing mistake.  At my level I can't say it is a mistake at all.  However, perhaps black believing it is a mistake after white's R6 invasion caused some fear and passive play.]
