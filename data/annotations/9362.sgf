C[UserkaffeI [8k\]: hi gl hf

Hi I am Kheng Hun, and I will write comments below whenever I have suggestions.

After looking through the game, shape is really quite important, and gaining tempo by attacking stone is important. At the lower left corner, too many moves were spent in the center, causing the left group to be weak. try to secure your group before attacking. Have fun playing go :)]

;W[kc]C[I very rarely play pincer in my games, but this time I chose to do one just to learn to use them better. I'd like to know if it really is a good idea to play one here or not.

it is a good idea to play pincer if you wish to attack the stone]

(;W[kg]C[I'd love to play something like Q5,Q6,R5,R6 even maybe Q10 or R10 in this situation, but I thought that would cause me to lose L15 group. Am I right or is L15 group ok without L13 stone? Are there any better options in this situation?

to secure the white group and not play slowly, maybe consider attacking the two black stones directly? I provide some possible moves]

The game is really lost by now, black can just play safe after this.]
