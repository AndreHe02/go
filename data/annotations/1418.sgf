C[Hi Yaron, hi Sandor,

your game was interesting and fun to review. You surely play in the middle-kyu ranks around 10-15 but it is impossible to give an exact estimation by seeing only one game.   It would be a good idea to go over this review together and discuss the main points as well as playing out some variations.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have further questions concerning this game.

Please note that I am far from being a perfect player and my suggestions may be wrong. But i hope that they will help you to find your own style.

Bye, Jorg.];B[dd];W[pd];B[eq];W[cp]LB[pp:a]MA[eq]C[--------------
This move is not really good for White. Please remember that empy corner are usually the bigger points.

Black had the first move, it is natural for him to make an enclosure.   Another point is the direction of play. If Black next plays at a 'X' is well placed.

White should definitely play in the empty corner first.];B[cn]
MA[dd]C[idea: surround c4 or let it sneak out, but not both.
would q4 have been better?

--------------
Q4 would definitely be better (see the last move).
There is a joseki (fixed corner pattern) like this but in this case Black should take the advantage and play in the empty corner.  This move is not too bad at all because it still has some effect on 'X' but the empty corner is bigger.]
;W[pp];B[pj]LB[do:a][qj:b]C[--------------
I think the corner in the lower left needs more attention. There would be a lot of possible moves, it depends on the personal style. Black could try to seal White in with a for example.

Anyway, if you like to establish a position on the left try the third line (b). It makes it easier to build a base.]
;W[qg]MA[cp]SQ[do][dn][ep]C[--------------
This is not urgent.
White should wait a few moves and realize how this game develops. Then he could decide if an approach from the top OR from the bottom is appropriate.
The concept of having these two options is called "miai".

At this point I would try to come out with 'X'. (some possible moves are marked)
White would seperate the black stones and would then have the possibility to attack at least one of them.

"Seperate where it is possible" is an important proverb.];B[pm]
;W[mq];B[qp];W[qq]C[Would R5 have been a better response for W?

--------------
I think there is nothing wrong with this move. It is a peaceful way to play. White gets the corner and Black makes a base.]
;B[rp]
(;W[rj]C[--------------
This move comes too early. It is just an endgame move. var is bigger.

But there are other big points, too.   Comming out with 'X' or playing the checking extension at 'a'.

Don't be too concerned about your opponent getting some territory. As long as you are able to play the bigger moves or even equal big moves it is ok.   White missed his chances here.]

;B[rk]
(;W[si]C[--------------
This is VERY small. You loose the initiative as well.   Don't be too concerned about single stones or even small groups if they don't serve a purpose. For example as cutting stones.]

(;B[dj]C[--------------
This move looks good. This side seems to be well balanced now, but I can't help...
I feel that a play on the other side would be bigger.  see var]
;W[cf]
(;B[dg]C[--------------
I don't like this move.

var is another idea...];W[jd]MA[cf]C[--------------
This is a good move. There is still some potential left in 'X' which could later be exploited, but for now, this move is huge.]
;B[gc];W[cc]C[--------------
Good. Uses the other stone.];B[cd]C[--------------
good];W[dc];B[ed]C[Just generally curious what you think about the opening.   Who is this opening better for?  Are there any obvious mistakes that were made?


--------------
I think this game is rather even. Black has good options to develop the left side. The outcome of the game is determined by the ability of both sides to find the big points. As the game shows you both missed some of them. :-)]
;W[jj]C[--------------
Oh no! White should care for his group in the upper left!]
(;B[mj]C[--------------
small point.

big point, but saving the group in the upper left is bigger. :-)]
;B[hq];W[ep];B[fp];W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[el];W[fm];B[ip];W[jq]

(;B[in];W[md]C[--------------

"Urgent points before big points" is another good proverb.

White should take care about his groups in the upper and lower right.

Locally, this is a big point of course, but saving the endagered groups is bigger.]
;B[po];W[op];B[gf]C[--------------
small];W[dq]C[--------------
very good];B[er]
(;W[mg]C[--------------
This is small and inconsistent. Take the corner and make the group save. And the group in the upper left is still in danger, too.]
;B[ik];W[ij];B[gk]C[--------------
Now the white group is shut in and needs to make live immediately.]

(;W[gj]C[--------------
Very small.];B[hk];W[ec];B[fc]
(;W[co]C[--------------
Play var first, it is sente (keeps the initiative)];B[bn];W[jf]
C[--------------
Very small. Try to play consistent and secure the corners first.]
;B[kp]C[--------------
This is very small, too. Black has good attacks against the two White corners on the left. If you don't catch them, White will secure them.]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[ib]C[--------------
Compared to the security of the corners this move is very small.]
;B[eb];W[mo]C[--------------
small

Black will not be able to secure a lot of territory here. If he blocks here, White is able to go in at the top. and vica versa.]

(;W[mm]TR[jh]C[This was clearly a big mistake for W (although B takes a move or two to realize this.)  A move like the marked one would have saved white's group here.  Could W have won with the right move here, or is it too late?

--------------
far too late. see var];B[jh];W[kg];B[lm];W[rq];B[ig]MA[md]C[White concedes

A general question:  B let white build a huge, uncontested space in the UR corner.  This seems like a mistake, but I'm not sure what B should have done differently.

--------------
That big space (moyo) lloks bigger than it really is. Remember that the 4/4 point does not secure territory. An invasion at the 3/3 point at the top right is still possible and would be sucessful.

Of course timing is important when you want to reduce a moyo. 'X' was big in making that area saver, but Black took the advantage and captured a corner group.  If White had saved this group an invasion around 'X' would have been possible.]

(;W[jh]C[--------------
I don't think that White could come close.  By the way the uper right corner is still open to an invasion.   Black should have played the next move earlier.]
