C[Hi and thank you for the review, I've places questions through out the game that I hope you can help me with, but any additional advice would be appreciated.]

;W[dq];B[cp];W[ql];B[or]C[Is this correct, or would another move be better? Was fuseki okay up until this point?

krv:Till now fuseki is good.
 I don't like this move. Seems like C10 is bigger and in this corner better is S6. If play herer I'd play at Q2 (better shape)]
;W[hq]C[krv: here white should play at O2 and black shape is weak.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[ci]C[Is this the correct extension?

Yes.];W[fn];B[em];W[gl];B[rm]C[krv: S6 better (like Q2)];W[rd]
;B[mn]C[krv: seems like R17 is bigger];W[qc];B[pc];W[nr];B[oq]
;W[ek];B[ck];W[kn]C[Is this move too slow for white?

krv: This move is ok, but it may be played at L7 (difference is small). I like S8 here.]
;B[pg];W[qg];B[ff]C[Is this move too slow? I was at a loss of what to play here.

krv: shapes like P15, Q13 vs R14, R13, R11 push my mind to play at Q12. But your move seems ok.]
;W[mg]C[krv: Q12 still seems good. N15 is small and not dangerous for white.]

C[krv: seems like here you must play at p17 to keep 2 points.]

I was thinking maybe a joseki book, but I don't know.  I'm looking to maybe make it to 1dan in a year?

Thanks

krv:Your fuseki is good (I see only one doubt move and one mistake), middlegame is ok too, but several moves are tough - you make bad shapes. Also I see several yose mistakes - small, but 10-20 points every game may add 1-2 stones to your strenght.]
