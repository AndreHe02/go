AB[pd][dp][pp]C[KGS ranked game played 24/08/2010 between swalter17 (Black, 20k) and Udaeus (Me, 17k)

I've made a few comments on the game, but I'm most interested in the opening (up to move 25), and how black could deal with the white invasion at move 215 as the game was fairly close until this point.

Hi Udaeus, 

I'll do my best to answer your questions. I hope it will be helpful.

-Yuan];W[dd];B[jd];W[be]LB[ci:A][cj:C][dj:B][qj:D]C[Is this the right enclosure? Aiming at an extension around A if given the opportunity.

---

For corner enclosure, it might just be simpler to start at 3,3 (one move to take corner territory) or use small knight's corner enclosure.

This move right now is unnecessary, you can directly make the extention. The idea of 4,4 is that it only takes 1 move to seal a corner, and it can quickly extend to both wings. If your opponent miss the opportunity to invade the corner (e.g. 3,3), then you get a large corner territory. If your opponent do invade, you get the opportunity to build up thickness and outward influence.

If you want to extend to the side, the usual method is to extend to the star point, or the point below star point (points B, or C)

In this case, the usual method would be R10 (D). It would prevent black from extending to both corners and form a huge moyo. See variation.]
(;B[pg]LB[pj:A][qj:B]SQ[jd][pd][pp]C[Extension by black seems too small, would R11 secure the side better?

---

This move is unclear. It's too loose to secure the corner, and very timid extention. It might be to create moyo in the opper right with a follow up move at K13. This is an good opportunity for white to gain a move. The more usual methods is A or B. Personally, I would have prefered A, because with the square stones, A would build up influence nicely. A + the square stones is one of the classic forms of cosmic style opening.

As for R11 securing the side, either R11 or R10, or Q10 leaves space for invasion. Even a small extension like Q13 leaves opening in the corner and side. As for what's the best move, it all depends on what your purpose is, and where you want to game to go. That's a pretty high level concept. I know this is what you should do, but execution is hard. I suspect it is even so, or even more so, for dan players or pro players, since their opponent (assuming equal strength) knows just as much as they do.]
(;W[qj]C[Is the timing of this play right?

---

This move should be played earlier. R9 might be better. See my earlier comment and variation (not all variations, just some possible outcomes).]
(;B[nj]LB[oj:B][ql:A][qm:C]SQ[jd][pd][pg]C[Black playing very softly, possibly going for a loose enclosure, would a pincer at A be better?

---

I believe Black is trying for form moyo with upper stones (marked in squares). This is a playable idea. Although this is loose, white doesn't have any good way to retaliate. The idea is to seal white in. B might be better. 

A is more severe. But, it's more confusing, so White might take advantage. 

Personally, I would prefered C. Black is ahead due to handcap stones. He can afford to play conservatively. If White doesn't invade the lower corner in time, Black get a large corner. See variations.]
;W[qm]C[Good. This helpd settle white group.];B[pm];W[pl];B[pn]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[pk]C[Is the white on the right side settled at this point?

---

White is pretty much settled. If Black tries to prevent White from running out, White will live locally. If Black tries to kill White, at the very worse, White can still run out.]
;B[dj]
(;W[ch]LB[cm:B][jp:A]TR[dj]C[Too high? Aiming at moving under black's marked stone.

---

This move is in the wrong location. White should play around K3 (A) or Black will. See variation.

If you want to play under, you might start around B at some point. Divide the black stones, and connect back out under the black triangle stone.

Another way to play would be just go directly below black stone, C10 and C11.]
(;B[cn]
(;W[eh]LB[cj:A]C[Trying to limit black's movement on the upper left side - on review, seems like a bad move. Not sure whether A is better.

---

At this point, White should make big moves (e.g. K3) to try to catch up. A would help black. See variations.]
;B[if];W[gc]LB[ef:A]C[Assumed that a move at  A would be an overplay by black at this point, went for profit in the corner.

---

Black doesn't need to play A. He has more than enough potential territories. He just need to play conservatively. Black is ahead and now has sente.]
(;B[ih]
(;W[mq]C[Lower side looks to be the largest area on the board, looking to put some pressure on the black in the bottom right, and take some profit on the lower side.

---

This is the right general idea. This is a bit too close to black wall. I would prefered a move around k3, k4 or J4. It's too easy for Black to attack and trap White. See variations.]
(;B[mo]LB[kq:A]SQ[dj][cn][dp]C[Black plays softly again, had expected a pincer near A.

This is a strange move. I assume Black wants to create more moyo with his stones on the lower left side.]

Black already knows White will be able to come in. Either way, he only closes maybe 2pt from each capture. He could use the move to save one of his stones from immediate threat to strengthen his other groups and territories. But the move he chose was unnecessary.

You are playing end game moves. There are still larger moves out there.
