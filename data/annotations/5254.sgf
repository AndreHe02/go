C[> um i know am not very good but i hope your review will help me see
> > my mistake plus am looking for a tutor thank you

Hi, my name is Damien. I am 14kyu French so I am not so good but i hope this review will help you. I'll put general comments at the end of the review.
If you have any questions you can join me by email or on kgs (dmg) or dragongoserver (dmg).

I have just realized I am using a lot of term you may not know. I've putted them on variations of move 2.]

[ff:D][gm:C][kf:1][qg:2]C[Ok let's stop now to consider point counting and group analysis.

White :
9 capture+52+29=90 of firm territory (triangle)
8+38=46 possible territory (square)
no influence
So that's about 123pt

Black :
2 capture+15+10=27 firm territory (round).
32 point of possible territory (cross)
so that's about 43pt of territory.

That give W+80pt

However black may have a chance to save the group 2 which is 20 pt (40pt of possible territory).
Moreover black has influence towards zone A, B, C and D.
A and B are 18 pt 
C is about 40 pt
D is about 25 pt.

So what black should do ?
First secure as much territory in zone A and C which can be 50pt with a stone at G9.
Second try to revive the group 2 which is around 20pt less for white.
then try to get as much as possible for zone B. D is small and hard to defend.
There's still the problem of the group 1 which is around 20pt. However letting white capture this group and securing 20 pt in zone D is feasable and secure point in B in the same time.
So that's move try to secure point in zone D and is a good idea but not the more urgent.

So if you suceed everything that will give black around 80pt which is the score difference :p.]

My opinion :
1/ First, you should work on tsumego, especially black. see http://www.goproblems.com. Passing 20k can be done only with some basics on shape and life and death.
2/ Work on shape, see what shape work and why. Especially white. See the variation at the beginning.
3/ Have a plan. That's important. Even without counting, you can estimate who is ahead and what you can do to win.
4/ Work on fuseki. Try to attack more and strenghten yourself when attacking.]

[ee:1][fd:3][iq:F][pd:B][pp:C][qj:G]C[Black E is a keima. That's a jump of two ahead and one on the side. it can be cutted as shown in A. However, that's a very strong shape, good for attacking.

B is a kosumi which is good to escape or to divide. The two stone can be connected by both side.

C is a tobi (I think that a tobi is only toward the center, but non-japanese use it for any one-space jump). It's a good reinforcement and a good way to escape. Cutting a tobi is something very harsh and should be computed long before doing it.

D is a hane. It's a kosumi with a opponent stone in one side. It's a way to put pressure on the opponent. There's a proverb that say "always hane at the head of two stones". The reason is that if you take the F group, you see that black is pressed on the border while white is strong and getting influence toward the center.

G is a tsuke. In fact tsuke is the action of puting a stone next to another. It's generally considered bad in the earlier stage of the game because you strenghtening the opponent in gote and your strengh is generally too far from the rest and too near from the opponent strenght.]

[dd:A][do:F][fo:1][pk:D][po:C][qf:E]C[Black A and B pincer white, it generally leads to A and B making territory while white escaping or White getting the corner and black making a wall facing k16.

Black C  without a white stone at r4 (empty triangle) is say to be a bad shape.
It has 7 liberties for 3 stones against 6 for 2 stones and 4 for 1 stone. Efficiency of a shape is oftenly compared to liberties against number of stone involved in the shape.
Empty triangle often lead to damezumari.
Black E is a full triangle and it's oftenly a good shape because it doesn't affect the number of black liberties but reduce the number of white liberties. It's a strong shape that happens especially during the connection of a kosumi.

If black play 1, the F group will be damezumari since white capture by playing d2. Damezumari means shortage of liberties. That's happens often when one try to cut the opponent whithout looking for liberties of it's own group.]
