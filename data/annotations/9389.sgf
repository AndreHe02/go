Dear reviewer,

this is a game I recently played on the Internet. I am playing White. Until the middle of the game I was rather confident I would win, but in the end I lost. I made a six point mistake in the end, so that the margin was a bit larger, but I would have lost anyway. I think I play too passively in middle game fighting, but I'm not sure. Any comments would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!



JW: All my comments will be started like this.

JW: You lost your lead before you realized it.

;B[en];W[fp];B[dk];W[co];B[dn]C[This seems like an unusual move...

(;W[cf]LB[cg:A]C[I know that A is the shape point, but somehow I was inclined to play where I played, as it seems to bo more of a kakari.

JW: Yes, like leading 3.5 points, not much really.];B[rd];W[jj]

JW: Yes. S16 is a bit too passive but still big, not as shiny as K10 though.]
