RE[W+2.50]

AB[dp][pd][pp]C[I'm black in this 3 stone handicap game.  I ended up establishing a huge lead, but due to extremely bad playing i lost it and ended up losing the game by 2.5 moku :(

I feel like I played fairly strong for the first half of the game, but then i fell apart and blew a massive lead.

Mainly I'm looking for comments on where I could've made a better move (especially in cases where my opponent moved wrong, so that I don't get into bad habits that will hurt me as i play stronger opponents), and general suggestions on how to improve my playing style.

Thanks in advance!

MM: Ok, I'll try to focus on places where you missed a chance to take advantage of White's mistake.]
;W[cd];B[ed]C[This is the proper way to play in handicap go?  I generally play much more aggressively than usual because of the advantage.  Is the 1 point jump or the knight's move a better attack in this situation (or does it matter?)

MM: I'm not strong enough to answer this definitively (only 8k AGA), but this looks fine to me. The usual advice in a handicap game is ''keep your stones connected, and stay away from fights because White is looking for ways to confuse you'' -- but if you enjoy fighting, go ahead and be aggressive. The main thing is to pay attention and learn. :-)]
;W[gc];B[df]TR[dc][ic]CR[cc][fe][gd][eb]C[MM: Maybe more natural would be to split White with D17, or counter-pincer with something near J17. This D14 seems to let White off the hook somewhat. But to be sure, let's look at a joseki dictionary, such as Kogo's at:
http://home1.gte.net/res0kgks/joseki.htm
Hmm, Kogo's does not show either of my choices... I'd better learn some joseki! It also does not show your move... rather, it shows C17, F15, G16, or E18 (circles) as possible moves, depending on what your plan is for this phase of the fuseki.]
;W[cf]TR[ec]C[MM: This does not seem to fully take advantage of Black's lax move. I would expect E17 instead. But maybe this is ok, since White has to worry about Black's handicap stones.]
;B[dh];W[ch];B[dj];W[cj]
(;B[cn]C[MM: Ok, here Black misses a chance to play more severely. Making this shimari - a loose corner enclosure - is good, but here it is not the most urgent move. Your stones on the fourth line can become a thick wall that will dominate the center, but right now, there are gaps that can be cut. Also, it would be good to make sure White's stones are separated. I would try to poke through White's 3rd-line stones. White will scramble to patch defects in the 3rd-line wall, which should let Black start an attack on the G17 White stone. This stone will probably live, so the aim of the attack would not be to kill - but rather to make territory while threatening to kill. Maybe the variation will help explain.]
;W[cl]TR[ec][nc]C[Bad play for white?  He probably could've broken into the middle here, right?  better for me to have played at d8 to seal him in, gain lots of center influence,  and give him the entire left side?  Or is it better to stop his expansion on the left at the cost of letting him break into the center?

MM: If I were White, I would probably break into the middle with D13 then Black F13, White C13... and Black has more weaknesses to patch. However, I tend to make unreasonable attacks when I play, so take my comments with a bit of salt. This looks like an ok result for White -- about 20 points of almost-guaranteed territory on the left, and openings to exploit in the Black wall.  So, your questions - Bad play? Not really, but certainly not the best play; E17 for example would be better, or near O17. Could've broken into the middle? Yes, I think so. Better for you to play at D8? But that is where you play next, so I'm not sure I understand this question. Stop his expansion on the left? You already did - the left side is pretty much settled for now.]
;B[dl];W[nq];B[pn];W[mc];B[lq]TR[jc][jd]C[MM: I'm not sure about this. Since White can live in the corner, maybe she can afford to ignore this for now, and come back to it later. Therefore, maybe it's best to make sure the quasi-wall on the left does not become negated by White's development on the top. I think something like K17, or maybe K16, is what Black needs here.]
;W[no];B[lo];W[qf];B[oe]C[MM: Good.];W[qj]C[MM: Risky; Black at Q12 looks severe.]
;B[ql]TR[qh]C[MM: White's stones are a little too far apart to be secure. Q12 will almost certainly bring large gains for Black.]
;W[ph]C[MM: Now White is stable, and probably alive. Next Black should focus on uniting his own stones, while keeping White split into different groups.]
;B[nh]TR[mm][nm][me]C[MM: Good idea; but maybe too loose. I'd prefer either N7, O7, or N15 first. Also, whoever starts poking first on the left will have an advantage, so maybe first C13.]
;W[ec]C[MM: That's too bad for Black. Black's thickness is becoming irrelevant.]
;B[fd];W[dd]TR[fc][dc]C[MM: ?  What is White thinking?  F17 is natural, or even D17.]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[eb];W[dc];B[gb]TR[dd]C[MM: Good way to punish White's goofy D16 move.]
;W[hc];B[he]TR[kc][jc]C[MM: There's probably a more severe move... maybe K17 or L17.]
;W[jd];B[jf];W[me]TR[oe][jd][mc]C[MM: Very good move! This reveals the looseness of Black 24 at O12. It threatens to cut in two directions. It also makes an excellent shape with K16 and N17 - the ''horse head'' shape.]
;B[lg]C[MM: This stops the cut in one direction. White can still isolate the Black stones in the upper right corner. But if Black gets to move at R17, Black can still live. Overall, Black seems to be ahead, but the huge center ''moyo'' - loose framework - has several weak spots, and should not be regarded as territory yet.]
;W[oc]C[MM: Small, and not very threatening.];B[hp]TR[lo][lq]
C[i thought my stones in the top right were connected to my middle group so decided to play here.  Hmm, would it be better to play here regardless?  I almost have the entire center sealed off (although perhaps this should've been on the 3rd line instead)  I played it on the 4th to get it to work better with the 2 marked stones

MM: You say you ''thought'' the top right was connect to the middle... so I predict White is about to cut them off. :-)
Still, this is a big play. It solidifies Black's grip on the bottom, though there is still room for White to make a small invasion live. It also helps solidify the center moyo - but please don't think the center is ''sealed off'', when there are all those gaps in your walls. I do like the shape it makes with M3 and M5, also with D4. So, a good question might be, is this move better than connecting the corner to the center with, say, P13?  I'm not sure, but I think the connection would be better. Even if White then invades the lower side, it usually makes more profit to connect your groups - and isolate the opponent's - than to spend a bunch of stones to barely live with two eyes. So, White gets more by cutting your groups apart than she would by invading the bottom and barely making a living group. Does that make sense?]
;W[of];B[nf];W[ne];B[og]TR[pf]C[MM: I would have picked the other atari, Q14. That would threaten the White stones on the right a little, and perhaps buy enough time to safeguard the Black corner group.]
;W[pf];B[pg]LB[mm:A]TR[oj]C[Extremely weak move?  Looking at it now I think it would've been better to play near the right-center to try to seal him out.  Where would be a good place to seal him out, maybe n7 ('a')?

MM: Yes, this is what we call a ''thank-you move''. Because you force White to do what she wants to do anyway - protect and strengthen her stones - so she should say ''Thank you!''
N7 is good. P10 (triangle) also looks good.
Keep in mind that Black can still fight for life in the corner.]
;W[qg];B[mf]C[MM: Pointless move, in every sense of the word. Does it threaten White? Does it make Black stronger or safer?]
;W[oh];B[ng]TR[qc][pr][mm][oj][ol][cq][ci][dk][nj][pk]C[MM: You could give up those two stones - they're only worth 4 or 6 points, and they are not serving a useful function like keeping White cut apart. If you see any moves that are worth more than these 4 or 5 points, then you should make that move instead (triangles).]
;W[oj];B[mj]TR[nl][ol]C[MM: I understand that you want to keep White out of the center, but I'm not sure it's possible - too many gaps. So it's probably better to focus on keeping White cut apart where you can. Therefore, I would like O8 or P8 better here.]
;W[qc]TR[ol][nm]C[MM: Big move, worth some 20-odd points. Still, White would probably do better with P8 or O7 first.]

(;B[nl]C[I took advantage of his tesuji to cut off his bottom stones.  Would I have been able to make life in the corner anyway at this point?  Maybe with a play at q17?

MM: Professionals like Yang or Cho might be able to force a seki or get a ko or something, but *I* don't see any possibility for Black in the upper right now. Q17 seems to go nowhere if answered, but it could be a source of ko threats.
Good to cut apart White's groups.];W[ol];B[nm];W[om];B[on];W[nn]
C[MM: Good - now deprive White of eyespace in the corner, and you're home free.]

;B[mr];W[nr];B[qr];W[qp];B[qo];W[rp];B[rq];W[qs];B[ro];W[rr]
;B[sp];W[sr];B[rs]C[One of the first times I've been able to successfully use a throw-in :)

I don't think it was really necesary in this case (i didn't destroy any eyes at least)  Although it would've been appropriate if he'd played at T3

MM: Congratulations. :-)
This Black corner offsets the White corner in the top right. Now just keep the center and the bottom, and you win easily.]
;W[ss];B[sq]C[MM: Not necessary; White cannot get more than one eye... actually, White can't even get one eye, because O1 and Q1 are miai - if White tries to make an eye by playing one, then you can destroy it by playing the other. Anyway, the White stones are dead as they stand, and Black need not play in this part of the board.]
;W[ps];B[rs];W[qm];B[pm];W[pl];B[rm];W[qk];B[rl];W[rk];B[sk]
C[MM: Small, only worth 3 or 4 points. Solidify your left wall instead.]
;W[sj];B[sl];W[ri];B[fq]TR[cn][dp][fq]C[Took advantage of the opportunity to solidify my bottom territory, a move that should have ended the game.  (The keima at f3 does protect against a 3-3 invasion, right?)

MM: I originally wrote, ''I *think* it protects against the 3-3 invasion, but I'm not completely sure ... There may be a way for White to invade and be sure of at least getting a ko for life...''
After further review, I see that the ko I thought possible is really silly and goes nowhere. I'm now almost sure that the hoshi plus the two at 3-6 and 6-3 work together to fully enclose the corner. But I'll leave in the variation, to make clear why there is no ko.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo]

;B[an];W[bm];B[bn]C[MM: Well, *that* 3-3 invasion certainly didn't succeed. :-)]
;W[cm]C[MM: A bit of a thank-you move, since Black wants to solidify the wall. Perhaps White's best idea here would be to peep from the inside, then try to make a living group in the center?]
;B[dm]C[MM: Of course, natural.];W[dn];B[do]C[MM: ?? Bad move. Why push White into the open space, instead of into the enclosed space?]

[ed][fd]CR[ff]C[this is where everything started to go downhill.  I feel like a move at e14 ('a') would've been appropriate, as it also protects the 3 stones but additionally it prevents the ugly sequence that followed.

Any other possibilities?

MM: You will hear over and over, ''the empty triangle is bad shape. Don't make empty triangles!'' You just made an empty triangle, so Bad Things may be in the future.
Yes, E14 looks good. I would also consider first playing C13 - threatening to cut White's stones, and then connecting all the Blacks with F14 (circle).]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[ef];B[ff];W[df]
(;B[fh]LB[eh:A][fg:B]C[Had to protect against the double atari.  I debated between playing here and at e12 ('a'), i was a little worried about a cut at f13 ('b') if I played the e12 move, but i think that i may have just been paranoid

MM: E12 ('a') is better. White can't cut at F13 ('b') because you just ladder her - variation.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[fg];W[dk];B[dh]LB[ej:A]C[stupid, stupid move.  Possibly the worst one of the game.  Defending at e10 ('a') seems appropriate.  Any other moves i could've considered?

MM: Yes, this is a pretty silly move. E10 ('a') does seem to solve all Black's big problems, as far as I can tell. You may have to give up a couple stones at D7-D8, but that's a small price to pay for a huge center territory.]
;W[ej]
(;B[ek]LB[fk:A]C[Uh, setting up a double atari on myself... f9 ('a') the best response?

MM: At first glance I don't like F9 so much, but it seems to work very well (variation).]
;W[el];B[em];W[fk];B[fl]TR[hk]C[MM: Not so good, you can't contain White that way. Better to give up the four stones, and limit the damage in the center with something like maybe H9.]

;B[fj]LB[gk:a]C[me not paying attention to liberties.  even if i were, this still seems like a bad move as it sets myself up for an atari that lets him break further into my atari.

How about a move at g9 ('a')  instead?

MM: G9 would be much better.];W[gm]TR[hk]C[MM: Bad move - better to jump into the center first with H9, or even just G9.]
;B[gl];W[hm];B[gk]LB[hl:A]C[another bad move... h8 ('a') better?

MM: I disagree; this is good. Now is your chance to take advantage of White's slack play at G7, and seal the center.]

(;B[fi]TR[dl][dm][em][fm][fl][gl][gk]LB[hl:a][hk:b][hj:c]C[didn't notice the peril that my marked stones were in.  what would be better to save the group, h8 or h9 (a or b)?

MM: Better to play the atari at H10 ('c') - variation.];W[hk]
;B[hj];W[hl];B[gi];W[gk];B[ij]C[MM: With the erasure of much of Black's center, the game is too close for me to be sure who leads, but I think Black may still be ahead by a handful of points. Simply keeping sente in the endgame may be enough to win.]

;W[ga];B[ma]C[Weak ko threat?  don't think i'm threatening anything with this move.  my "plan" was to maybe play at q17 and try to make life in the corner but it doesn't really seem possible.

MM: This doesn't put White in atari, and doesn't seem to threaten anything immediately. Q17 might be better, but also doesn't seem to be very threatening - if Black captures the two at P16-P17, White can stay connected by simply playing P16 (this is not a ko situation). I don't think you can live in the corner, but as long as White answers your moves, you lose nothing in exploring the possibility. Of course, best of all would be to connect at F18.]

Any comments on my general playing style, etc would be appreciated.  I know I definitely need to work on my reading skills, especially in running fights.  Thanks in advance!

MM: General playing style is for the professionals to worry about. :-) The usual advice probably applies - be greedy, but not too greedy; step back and look at the whole board; don't save small groups of stones unless they serve an important function; etc... All in all, very good for playing only a few months.  Reading practice will help, and so will simply playing.
Thanks for the chance to review your game!
