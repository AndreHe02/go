C[Hello! My name is Mika. Looking afterwards this game i didn't realize very well what i did wrong. I wasn't too greedy and i didn't make big mistakes. Also my opponent could have played much better sometimes. Why did I lose then?  Very hard for me to say. I appreciate if you could sum up my weaknesses and strenghts in the end.

Thank you in advance.

CH: 
Hi ! my name is Christoph, I'm a 6 kyu from Germany. 
The opening goes pretty well for you. Mistakes start with R10. From then on, B shows better positional judgement, first of all he understands moyos. You lost because you missed quite a few big moves, leaving them to your opponent. I tried to point them out, hope it will help. Your tactics are good, now you need to develop your instinct for what is big and small.]
;B[pp];W[qd];B[cp];W[dc];B[cj];W[ep];B[dq];W[hp]C[CH: While in enemy sphere of influence, play low (H3 instead of H4)]
;B[jq]C[CH: Now because H4 is high, you need an extra move and don't have time for E3.]

;W[ho];B[dn]LB[dn:A]TR[go][ho][ep][hp][eq][iq][fr][gr][ir]C[I noticed little earlier that i should have aimed at A, It was too late now, but was there any chance to play that because i was busy to protect those marked stones

CH: Given the start, you could not ask for more. All your moves were forced.]
;W[oc]C[CH:  Not bad, but the R7/Q7 setup calls for R11 or Q11 as the natural continuation.]
;B[ce];W[gc];B[qi]
(;W[qj]C[Is this good? That time i liked it but couple of moves later my situation wasn't just good as i thought.

CH: There is a proverb saying "never attach to a weak stone". Attaching to an enemy stone makes it stronger, eventually it will come to life.
    There is an exception to this rule: If your own R7 group was also weak, you may attach in order to strengthen it.
  Not in this situation, though: R7 group is strong enough, so you should have played R12, making territory whilst weakening the R11 stone. See variation.]
;B[pi];W[rj];B[ri];W[qg]C[i tried to pincer (is that correct term) black stones so that his only choice would be escaping.

CH: Good move, actually, a must. Otherwise, B will play at R14 and live easily.]
;B[qf];W[pf];B[pg];W[rf];B[of];W[pe];B[qh];W[rg];B[oh];W[pj]
;B[oj];W[om]C[I wanted to approach towards center.

CH: By now, Black is as good as alive. Every White move after R10 was natural, most were essential. This P7 is urgent, too: If B plays here, he gets too much territory from his moyo bottom right. 
    So even with the best possible continuation, R10 leads to a live Black group on the right side.]
;B[on];W[nm];B[mn];W[nn];B[no];W[ln];B[lo];W[kn];B[ko];W[in]
C[CH: what does this move earn you ?
 1) your bottom left group is alive already
 2) same for your right group, so no point in connecting these groups.
3) you're not protecting territory either, since the center is neutral.
4) Nor are you attacking an enemy group or reducing his territory.

So why not play around N14, E15 or similar big point.];B[lc]
;W[jc]LB[nd:A]C[Better to play A?

CH: Now disaster has struck. Honestly, I didn't peek before writing my previous comment. K17 is the best response.]
;B[nd];W[nc];B[kc];W[md];B[jd];W[ic];B[kf];W[me];B[ne];W[mc]
;B[mf]C[CH: All your responses were logical, but couldn't keep Black from neutralizing lots of potential white territory.]
;W[he]C[CH: should be at E15, definitely. There is no point in attacking B's live group on the right.]
;B[ee]C[CH: Now Black has mapped out vast regions on the left side, that will be hard to reduce.]
;W[cc]C[Too slow? It protecs the corner anyway.

CH: this is a huge endgame move, but it's too early: A play around F7/G8 is urgent, for if Black plays there he further expands his moyo.
     F7 or G8 threaten to follow up with F9/F10 and thus may turn out sente, while C17 threatens nothing.]
;B[fm]C[Oops. I should have noticed that earlier. Really big move i think.

CH: Again, I didn't peek ahead.];W[fj];B[ej];W[fi];B[ei]C[CH: The game is almost over. Every exchange leaves solid B territory on the left side, while the center is neutralized by the influence of B's group, so White makes a few points at best.]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[fg];B[eg];W[if];B[fk];W[gk];B[gl];W[hk];B[li]
SQ[jh][ji][ki][jj][kj]C[Not very good from black. I would have played somewhere in marked area.

CH. Black has made another 12 points of territory, while reducing the center to almost nothing. An excellent move, and more solid than the alternatives. Prepars to follow up at either K11 or M9.]
;W[ji];B[lk];W[ik]C[i don't know what to think about this move. It doesn't look good afterwards.

CH: K9 looks better locally. M1 is much better.];B[jh];W[ih]
;B[jg];W[ig];B[jr];W[is];B[js];W[fq];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp];W[mm]
C[CH: should be at P9.];B[ok];W[pk];B[sj];W[sk];B[rk];W[rl]

(;W[qg];B[qk];W[nm]C[CH: now B has a weak group to worry about, and while he is busy saving it, W makes territory with his upper moyo or reduces B's lower moyo.]
