C[I played this game as White on IGS.
I think I lose the game on : 56, 84, 112 and 162.

Thank you for reviewing my game...



------------------------------------------------------
HI, I'm Linux [4k\]      

This game was not so easy I thought before the review .
I think you lost the game because strategic mistakes (moves 40-42 and 60),
moves that were like a pass (moves 52 and 84) 
and twice you miss to kill your opponent (moves 120 and 180).

For 14k players the game was complicated and has interesting fights..
Hope you enjoy the comments...

;W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[cf]LB[fc:C][cf:1][co:B][do:A]C[Linux: Unorthodox move, but no wrong. Normal moves are black A, B or C.]

(;W[ce]LB[fc:A][ch:B]C[Linux: The kosumi isn't good. So you strenghtens your opponent.  White A here is the natural flow. (see variation) Maybe a pincer at B is also good, but not so easy to play.]
;B[co]C[Linux: Black has to answer C15...];W[fp];B[dj];W[ch]
LB[bf:B][df:A][cp:C]C[I thought black was a little thin on the left side. I chose to invade, trying to take some advantage of the situation...

Linux: If you want to play on the left side, there are some locally good moves (A-C).  C12 is bad. If black plays A himself, you get two weak groups (see variation)]

(;B[bq];W[cr];B[ci]LB[df:A]C[Linux: Black must play A .];W[dh]
;B[bh];W[bg];B[cg]
(;W[bi]LB[bf:A][bi:1]TR[cf][cg]C[Linux: White 1 is a mistake. White A  catches the two black stones...]
;B[bf];W[ah];B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[cd];B[ee];W[ed];B[fe]
(;W[fd]LB[dg:A]C[Linux: This is slow. The black group is heavy. You've to find moves to attack him. Here a forcing move like A seems a good way to begin. (see variation)]
;B[dg]C[I was pretty happy with the result. A good chunk of teritory in the corner and a weak fat black group on the run :-)]
;W[cj]LB[fh:A]TR[be][de][ee][fe][bf][cf][cg][dg]C[Linux: Attack with A is important to hold black under control.]
;B[di];W[eh];B[ck];W[bj]C[Made a base, in case something came wrong...]
;B[dl]
(;W[ge]LB[ge:1][gh:A]C[Chasing the black weak group again, but not sure of the way to do it. I decided to go this way bacause of the teritory on the upper side...

Linux: Attack the black group is OK, but white 1 is the wrong direction I think. If black runs out, your group has only one eye. There is a proverb "The best point of your opponent is your best point too". Play A here. (see variation)]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[ff];W[gf]C[Linux: Your left group has one eye only! This is carelessly :-)]
;B[gh];W[gg]C[Linux: This move has no effect on black. And: your left group becomes more weakly.]
;B[fh];W[ei];B[fj]LB[gk:A][fl:B]C[Linux: Here black can attack you lightly at around A or B. And there is a good chance, that white dies. This is a bad result for white. The last 3 white moves were the first big mistakes in the game. (The game isn't over, but now it will be hard to win)

1. You are missing to attack the black group (he has connect his groups),
2. Your group was nearly dead
3. Black getting a nice influence];W[ej];B[ek]C[Linux: Too angry. Black must fight.]
;W[dk];B[fl];W[dj]C[Too small I think afterward.

Linux: Yes, but you can be lucky getting life so easy :-)];B[fi]
;W[cl]LB[nd:C][pj:B][nq:A]C[Linux: This is very small. C8 has no value, because your group already lives . A, B or C are big moves here (For both players)]
;B[cm];W[bl];B[em]C[The black group is out of the wood.

Linux: After F10 (move 45) the black group was not in danger ;-).]

(;W[nc]LB[qf:B][nq:A]C[Probably too far from my wall.

Linux: Maybe A is more important, but O17 isn't wrong. Black has to answer. 
I prefer B. (see variation)];B[oc];W[nd]C[Linux: OK.];B[ic]
LB[kc:A][qc:B][pe:C]C[ I let black invade. But black get too strong too fast here. I probably did something wrong...

Linux: The Black stone is now weak. Let him no secure base. To find the right move here is not easy I think, but first you have to support your O17 group. I would play A here. I see no good way for black. And: After L17 you can black punish at the corner at B or C later. (see variation)]

(;W[gc];B[lc]LB[gc:A]TR[nc][nd]C[Linux: The problem with white A is, that your O17 group becomes weak. And thats why you have nor enough power to attack the black stones.]

(;W[le]LB[kd:B][nf:A]C[Linux: First you should play A, then attack at B. (see variation)]
;B[hd];W[gd]LB[if:A]C[Linux: This connection is not neccesary... Now A would a good point...]
;B[kd]C[Linux: You can't kill black here. Change to another point of interest now. Maybe you can attack the black group later.]
;W[je]LB[jf:A]C[Linux: This is not good. A is better here. So you get two cutting points and black will attack YOU.]
;B[ke];W[kf];B[ie];W[if];B[jd];W[jf];B[me];W[ld];B[md];W[lf]
;B[ne]LB[qc:A]C[Linux: This is desastrous for white. Maybe plunge into the corner is now a good choice (see variation).]

(;W[mc];B[lb]
(;W[od]LB[od:1][oe:A]C[Linux: What about A here instead of 1? This fight is not easy, but you can try it. (see variation)]
;B[oe]
(;W[ob]LB[ob:1][pc:A]C[Linux: If you want to play here, then fight at A. White 1 destroys all your aji. With A you can get a Ko (or a life in the corner).]
;B[pc];W[hh]LB[qj:C][qn:B][nq:A]C[Very bad choise I think afterward.
Making a bse for my botom left group was way bigger.
I wanted to take advantage of my thikness in the area but didnt find something usefull to do. I lose a big chunk of teritory on the upper side and was eager to take advantage of the thinkness gained in the process.

Linux: Yes, your upper side was a big loss. A-C were now moves you'd to play. H12 is very bad: You can't attack the G12 group and you make no territory or influence, and this is gote!]
;B[gr]
(;W[iq]LB[hq:A]TR[fl][cm][em][co][bq]C[Probably not the best way to resist. I dont know exactly what do do here.

Linux: The direction is not bad, but J3 is too loose. Black will try to cut you, because his marke stones are strong. I prefer A here. (see variation)]
;B[gp]LB[gq:A]C[Linux: This is painful for white. You should play A I think.]

;B[bp];W[br];B[cq];W[dp];B[do];W[gm]C[Linux: Good. Now you have two eyes.]
;B[hm];W[gl]C[Linux: If you want to attack black, then this move is good. (G9 is a serious threat..., see variation)]
;B[ko]
(;W[hk]C[I should have tried something to save my J3 group.

Linux: The J3 group? Then you have to play O3, O4 or N3 to support your stones. H9 is another big loss in the game (like H12)
In my opinion G9 kills black. (see variation)];B[kq]C[Linux: Something paranoid, but NOW black becomes very strong here.]
;W[gk]C[Linux: This move attacks black seriously. Maybe you can kill him. Or (if he escapes) you run in his sphere of influence at the right side...]
;B[fk];W[fm]C[This attack was hopeless, black have the possibility to make life...

Linux: If you want to kill black, F7 is right.];B[bm];W[am]
;B[an]
(;W[al]LB[aq:A]C[Linux: This is the mistake. You have to reduce blacks eyespace with A!]

;B[qf];W[pf];B[qe];W[pe];B[nb];W[of];B[pb];W[nf];B[mb]C[Linux: This was lucky for you. You have built a nice wall in the center.]

Linux: Yes. This is good timing.];B[pq];W[qp];B[rq]C[First time I see that I think.

Linux: Me also :). But if black has a plan, why not...];W[qr]
;B[rp];W[qo]C[Letting black take few points in the corner hoping to take some advantage of the wall even if Q4 group limit the possibilities. I dont know if it is a good choice...

Linux: Normally you need life here. Black helps you. Now HE must live in the corner and you can escape easy . This is better for you than a smalll life in the corner.]

(;W[hi]LB[ij:B][no:A]TR[lg][ng][pg][pj][pm]C[Linjx: This is not necessary. Your groups are save. You should play around A to reduce blacks bottom. Maybe you can try to kill the center group with B here, but this is not so easy because of the many cutting points.]
;B[jk]C[Black succed in his invasion :-(
I expected to top him...];W[jl]C[I think this was my mistake dealing with this invasion.
L10 should allow me to cut some part of the invader?
