Hi, I'm b in this game played on KGS. I would like suggestions on opening and middle game since thats where I feel w gained the advantage.

Thanks :D];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[po];B[qk]LB[qi:B]
[qj:A][pl:D][qm:C]C[reid: Hello Amar.

Let's start here.  White oten plays at A or B in this situation so that he can continue with a two-space extension no matter which way black pincers.  In this game, white has chosen to approach the black corner instead.  That means black should concentrate on building the upper-right framework at the expense of letting his lower right corner stone suffer a bit.

The best way to do that is to attack the white stone severely.  The problem with black R9 is that it is not a very severe attack (which is why it is not often seen).  Black C and D are the normal pincer attacks in response to the approach at Q5.  These moves maximize the upper right framework for black while limiting white's responses.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[op];B[nr];W[qq];B[pr];W[qp];B[kq]C[reid: This looks like a good result for black.  White didn't really take advantage of black R9, and instead played a normal joseki move with P3.  Now R9 is in a good position (R7 and Q8 would be too close to the strong white formation).  Also, white R4 could lead to problems later - this shape is not great.]
;W[qm]C[reid: White probably needs something here, but the result is very overconcentrated.]
;B[ok]C[reid: this is very good for black.];W[jd]C[reid: White is in a difficult situation already.  The black P2 stones and the white R4 group have similar territories, but the four black stones in the upper right are an ideal formation compared to the three left and upper side white stones.  Black is ahead.  Black can play safely and consolidate his win.]
;B[ce]LB[jb:F][cc:C][lc:G][mc:H][cf:B][df:A][ci:D][fq:E]C[reid: Approaching the corner like this after white has already played the K16 extension is a bit like closing the barn door after the horse has already run off.  Black's territory is already a bit better than white's, so there is no need to rush to reduce white's territory.  By playing close to the corner, black allows white to pincer and make effective use of K16.

If black wants to approach the corner, one line further away (either A (D14) or B (C14) gives black more space to work with.  If white still pincers, black can attach at C, for example, to make light shape.

But I think simply playing at D or extending to E is good enough for black.  White's top-side framework has a problem because it is open underneath (F), and there is no easy way for him to close it off.  White G is too over-concentrated, and white H is not sente (and may have problems later - the black corner is very strong).]
;W[cg]C[I'm interested in what you think of the sequence for here and if you have any other ideas.

reid: Well, the severe pincer with C13 is an ideal way for white to punish C15.  Black could lose his advantage now.]
;B[ee]LB[ed:A][fd:B][hd:D][de:C]C[reid: This is the normal move, but white's natural response at F16 is just too good.  I think black needs to try something different here: maybe black A or B.  If A, white will probably push and cut leading to a difficult continuation.  Black B expects something like white C then black D to counter-attack, leaving some aji in black C15 for later.

But everything is difficult for black, mostly because white already has K16 in place.  C15 was just too close.]
;W[fd];B[hd]LB[jb:D][gd:B][fe:A][dh:C]C[reid: Black H16 is joseki, but in this case white already has K16 in place, so everything changes.  I think black is not going to come out of this very well.

Joseki books admonish us that black A for white B is terrible, but here, when white already has K16, it's probably not bad (after white B, K16 is better at L17).  Then black could attack with something like C to stabilize this group.  black D is still a (yose) problem for white.]

;B[bd];W[dd];B[de];W[bc];B[bf];W[cb]LB[ad:A]C[reid: white should atari at A first, of course.]
;B[cj];W[cm];B[ld];W[jc];B[ej]C[reid: White did better here than black - he has caught up a bit.]

;W[md];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[le]C[reid: These last 20 moves have been better for black than for white - black solidified his large corner while white increased his area only about 10 points or so.]
;B[ll]C[sorminator [3d\]: h3 not better?

This seemed big but H3 also seemed big. In the end though i did get a piece of the centre so I'm not sure.

Center moves often seem bigger than they really are.  It helps to consider the *incremental* gain of each move.  Without M8, black's corner is about 40 points (assuming white reduces somewhere around N11).  Adding M8 increases that by only about 10 points (assuming white reduces around L10).

By comparison, if H3 makes a five point gain for black, or a 5 point gain for white, that is a total of 10 points, making it as big as M8.

But that's not thw whole story:  H3 isn't the right point.  If white plays, he'll attack the black bottom group with J3.  And if black plays, he wants to go all the way to G3 so he can try to activate the aji of a corner invasion around C5 or B4/5.  So the bottom is really a more important move.]

LB[hf:C][ig:A][jg:B][bo:D]C[I felt I had to make more in centre now.

reid: Unfortunately, there is no territory to be made in the center - there are white positions already neutralizing any further potential.

Instead of trying to make more territory, I think black should be trying to use some of the aji that's scattered around.  For example, black A threatens to cut off the K12 stones with B while also threatening to connect the dead G16 stones with C.  While it may not work right away, this kind of aji is a valuable asset that you should be trying to turn into terrotory, and ultimately, a win. Black D (B5) is another possible weak spot.

Best of all is if you can work two or more weaknesses against each other (A and D seem to be too far apart to make that work, but it's still worth thinking about).

I'm going to stop here. There is a fair amount here for you to work on, although it's rather subtle stuff for the most part.  Watch out for center moves: make sure they're really are as big as they look.  Don't try to reduce your opponent's territory if yours is already bigger.  Don't attack and take risks when you're ahead.  Don't try to take center territory if your opponent already has positions that reduce it.

Good luck, play strong,
