[gg][gi][jl][jj][ii][jp][jr][fq]C[KH:white lead, but not much, the game depends on the  following moves.  i have considered the A(c3), B(c5), and C(c10).

With all the marked stones, Black is strong, so he should start a fight. His position in the top left is strongest, so if he want to invade, this is the place (A). B is interesting in the lower left. c5 is odd, c10 too peaceful here.]
