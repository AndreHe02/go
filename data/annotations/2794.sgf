Rianon: Dear reviewer. I played black in this game. During the game, i believe, i didn't make any obvious blunders and most of the time i though it was an even game... However, in the end i lost by 4.5 moku. I've added a few comments on my thoughts in the game. I'm particularly interested in yose stage of the game, but i'd appreciate any other comments from you. I'm looking forward for your guidelines which may help me to improve. Thank you.

[TD: I will try my best to help you, even concerning Yose, where I am not so strong myself. 

I use SmartGoPlayer 1.1.2 from Anders Kierulf for editing my commentary. It works very nicely.

Please follow the variations of which I entered many. If you use an SGF-FF4 compatible reader there should be no problems of viewing all the variations and comments.\]

Concerning blunders: they are not important, important are rather consistent errors in principle questions, please cf. with my commentary on moves 21, 35, 43+45, 57, 61, 64, 69, 103, 109, 141, 181.]

(;B[fq]C[The reason for this move was that i didn't know what to do in the LR corner :-)

[TD: I agree that this is a valid reason. You are approaching a corner, as did White. From this point of view it is even. 

A black pincer on white 8 also c/would help to develop the upper right quarter for black.
However, many moves have their merits (and inherently lose out in some aspects on the others). Hence, for me the most important aspect in the opening is to I feel confident with it.

I conducted a pattern search on Jan van der Steen's gobase.org and found one game:
Honda Kunihisa (B, 9dan) vs. Park Yeonghun (W, 3 dan)  2002-03-22 W+ 1.5, there Black continues with a 1-high-pincer 9. I added some of its moves in the variation diagram.

Concluding on 9: In our amateur range, playing what you like makes you more confident. Very much is decided in the middle and endgame.\]]
;W[mp];B[cn]MA[pq]C[I considered to:
1. treat [x\] stone lightly (i thought, i could live in the corner after another move by black)
2. punish my opponent for not answering my previous move

[TD: 1. You do, local tenuki is a way to obtain sente elsewhere. Of course you can live. Interesting is more what white will/can do after having harrased you up to a small life.

2. I do not think in terms of punishing. You tenuki right, s/he tenukis on the left.]

(;W[fp]C[As concluded white needs to come out somehow.]
(;B[eq]C[I am not so sure about this move 13 here (English).
This move is not good (same meaning, now in German).];W[ep]
;B[dq];W[cp]C[White 16 seems soft.];B[gp];W[ck];B[en]C[I was satisfied with this result.

[You bet! You made a Shodan reply with empty triangle. The ultimate humiliation. Only for killing or connections in later stages in the games I would accept an empty triangle on my part. You achieved a huge success, I think.\]]
;W[fo]C[Brrrr....]
(;B[go]C[21 is very wrong for several (fundamental) reasons: 
1. you push your opponent out into the center (but s/he had to go there her/himself)
2. you weaken your weak group, the two stones CE6, by driving white to it.
3. You better strengthen your weak group instead.
4. Your stones 21 and 17 stick to white's stones, i.e. they have fewer liberties than for example a black fukuri at H3 (=fukurami=bulge play, a hane that expands a one point jump, or vice versa).
This bulge play had the same attaking value as 21 (if white tenukis black encloses) but much more cutting point protection, eye formation, liberties and territorial expansion value! 
5. the move has the same negative value as an atari given on a stone where you cannot expect to capture (opponent is still awake) - if you leave out those ataris out until you know exactly why and when you would need it, you have taken an important step for improvement. You do not do aji keshi, leave options open. Cutting ataris can often be given from two different directions. Early, you do often do not know, where your resulting cutting stone is better positioned - so wait until you know!  

You better strengthen your weak group instead.
The moves a and b spring first to my mind, but white C9 might disturb.]
;W[fn]C[In my view this 21-22 exchange means that it took you only one move to return the gift of white's emty triangle: your two black stones are not attacking anymore, but a target in white's sphere of influence!]
;B[el];W[dm]
(;B[em]C["a" would be lighter and you could separate white's forces, please confer with some variations which I have added.]
;W[dn];B[dl]LB[cl:A]C[Looks like aji-keshi, perhaps simply jumping somewhere? Is it too late to treat these stones lightly? (than you'd better simply forget them!).

Technically speaking it is simply the wrong way to cut a keima (C8=A would be).]
;W[cl];B[dj];W[cj];B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[cg]C[Technically I find 29-34 ok (not 27). 
(But they might not be the urgent area).];B[gl]LB[fj:a]C[But 35 does not seem to be the shape move - I would rather make the eye-shape making move "a".

It is my personal feeling that 35 comes from the wish to attack and keep sente.
However, sometimes the defensive move (e.g. "a") - looking gote - is more sente than the sente looking attacking move (35).

But 35 does not attack at this time, because white is quite connected, san-san is not yet played (enables tactical aji).

This means that black muts go back and patch-up (losing sente). In retroperspective - will 35 then have been so valuable?]
;W[gn]C[Difficult for white separating, but at the same time pushing on the 6th line. Is this good?]
;B[io];W[in];B[jo];W[ff]C[40: I would prefer more normal moves, e.g. kakaris, extensions, checking extensions where I know more what they are worth before I do this type of low-functionality move.

Doing "normal' moves could mean that I wait for my chance to exploit the attacking possibilities on the black group (where black failed to make the eye-shape).

I think white plays to hasty.];B[kq]C[This keima prepares/threatens a connection to black´s Q3 3-4, prevents white playing the same keima which, in turn, would prevent this while threatening to nibble blacks base away.

I like this move now, although at first I regretted the whole action after black 35, because I would try hard to be the first one to go into another corner, make a shimari, an extension, a kakari etc.]
;W[qo]LB[mr:b]C[Rare. Does not fit the situation.
This move is played in large moyos for not allowing the other one to live.

Here is no mojo (Q10 and surroundings are empty, N4 is to narrow and near opponents forces, eventually Q3 is also already inside).

But here you simply can threaten to connect by a sliding keima at b!]

(;B[no]C[Very wrong shape again.
Perhaps black was confused with a niken-taka-basami Joseki here, where white is pincered 2-high at Q7 and white 42 is non-existing.]

(;W[np]
(;B[op]C[Wrong shape. I would take the sente keima slide and(/ or) proceed (directly) with the upper right corner or an extension from there.]

;B[nq];W[dk];B[ns]LB[nn:A]C[Please compare: the value of the corner itself,  say 25+ points (honestly of course we must add the value in the center after a black nobi at O6) and the center - invaluable?!

I thought, that black wanted to win the ko or at least gain in the exchange for it.

The result I see now is that black got a (or two, but you do not want to save them) weak, eyeless group in the centrum. This is horrible! White profited.]
;W[fj]C[Black is now under attack on the left.

In such a situation you have several choices:
1) you (a) defend (e.g. make eyes), (b) connect or (c) counterattack (e.g. a neighbouring group, to help yours) - immeadeately
2) you do the same as in 1), but postpone it a little bit, and do other things on the board, which changes the global position, hence sometimes  the importance of the - temporarily tenuki-ed local fight.
3) You rely on sabaki ( involves point 2)
4) you skillfully (or not?) sacrifice the group or stones ( a bit similar to point 1c).

Your decision depends on several evaluations of criteria, 
1) shape and relative strength of that group (does it allow for sabaki tactics?)
2) imortance of group or stones (are they cutting stones? Does the life of an enemies group depend on it? Influential value or just x-dame points, which are y-times the value of a move 
at that stage? 
3) global position (are you leading or behind?)
4) I call it "Development risk" in case of failure: 
How big is possible collateral dammage, if your opponent uses leaning attacks against you, waits with the attack or just lets you lose sente (a move) for your defending?
Would/could other friendly (enemies) areas be affected by the fight?

Etc. etc.
It is so much more important to think before any fight of what might be the outcome, 
where it could lead to, 
what your aims and risks involved are
than the actual fighting skills ("Riding a tiger, it is difficult to get off." = "Qi hu - nan xia", chin. proverb). Of course my proposition is debatable (by the strong fighters).

OK, here comes my personal evaluation:
1) shape is not so good, it does not allow for sabaki, because black did not play 35 at F10, the eye-making shape move.
2) Importance: might be big, is in the center, but all neighboring groups, friend or foe are clearly alive and not threatened => low.
3) I don´t know who is leading, hence, let´s assume it is even.
4) Uncertainty factor for development risk: high chance for getting a weak BIG group, which could be chase (with profit somewhere else).

Conclusion (choice of 1-4 from the very top):
1a, 1b, 1c all do not seem possible; 
sabaki (3) is not possible, the stones are both fixed and lack eye shape;
hence try to postpone actions here with the aim to try sacrifice tactics (4) later (difficult).]
;B[gj]LB[ek:A]C[59 is an attaching move for collecting strength, hence ok for your situation.
In order to force white to make choices, I would then, sometime afterwards play A. White´s 58 still has 3 liberties the, but one way less to go, it cannot connect to the left.]
;W[gi]
(;B[fk]LB[ek:A][hj:B][gk:C][ej:D][fi:E]C[I would play B.
(If I´d play black A first, with the hope for an immediate white D, then a black cut at E - I would underestimate the danger of the atari B in the center).

61 is bad because black must expect the atari B.
Does black want a white ponnuki with C? No
Does black want to connect with 63 at C after the atari? No, you didn´t do either (it looks like bad shape, there is an empty triangle innvolved).

Hence, do not play 61 to save 6 unimportant stones on the left from being cut - and - in addition - allow white the central atari.]
BM[1];W[hj]TE[1];B[il]C[63 is ok with respect to the variants just shown before, but globally a white ponnuki in the center with the right side quite empty will be a disaster.

Hence, the mistake lies much earlier - in the ko on the right side? ot the shape of black 35 which gives you a bad flash back now.]

(;W[hm]C[64 should make a ponnuki - simple, clean and strong.]
BM[1];B[gk]LB[fi:A][hi:B][ho:C][hn:D][im:E]C[Now A and B are black´s miai options.
And black has the ikken-tobi out in the center.

64 instead looks quite useless at the moment.
An experimental thought (pro-active tewari): 
f black played C and white wanted to stay connected to the outside,
then white had to play D or E, both being empty triangles, contributing nothing but inducing an outer reinforcement of black.]

(;B[jn]LB[hi:A][fi:B]C[Why not A or B?

;B[nn]C[I find 69 ok. You could also consider playing it around 70, combining it with an upper right shimari if you get sente while white will somehow make a base for the 3 stones.

Have you thought about the clamp?

If it works, it means that all black moves around there were only strengthening white, resp. a dead black group bulging white territory from the inside!

However, with regard to the aspect of speed, I prefer white´s actual 70 over capturing black´s group with a clamp in gote.
If the black stone come out they remain a nice target. On the other hand, if white does not develop on the right side, black will dominate it.]

You have a vast choice of 'Joseki' moves or established patterns.
In a way (my interpretation) black 13 makes white heavy, by inducing 14 (I could be wrong here). After all, this is the start of one of the most established sequences, best  known by anyone playing handicap games. Hence, white becoming stronger by 14 must be outweighed or equalized by black having a kikashi (13), which could be treated lighter in some of those cases where black enters the corner with B.

Both edge star point areas are free, i.e. there are no near-by white stones, which makes blacks strategic fighting easy.]

(;W[qq]C[Some time after the ponnuki, 12 is possible.
I guess white would like first to know how to use a possibly developing white wall, before playing this sequence.

However, if 12 was to be played immediately,
(me) black would like to play on 5-5 (E5) in the left corner, enclosing white. On the right there would always remain aji's to either live or reduce.

Imagine white using 4 moves on the right, just to take one corner! In the meantime you had enclosed the lower left and upper right.]
