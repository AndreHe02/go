C[This game has a good example of something I've been wondering about, something I don't know how to deal with very well (at all).  It's at move 25.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]C[To here everything's very predictable, and I'm comfortable with the result.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[Uh oh.



>From here, the standard response seems to be R17, but that gives black a really nice wall...  Does this mean that O17 was a poor choice?

-O17 wasn't a poor choice, after black 11, white could have made an ikken-tobi at O15, black Q14 and white L16, but R17 seems allso possible.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]C[Yilun Yang is confident this is better than A, though I don't really understand why.  If you understand, please enlighten me.

- you pointed out that black would get a strong wall, if black plays 15 at R15, the black wall will become less strong, because of the cutting point at R15.]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[rf];B[qg];W[rg]
;B[qh]C[Here's the predicted nice wall.



Black has a start on a really huge moyo now, around the lower right.



I'm very unsure what to do here, to reduce this.  The distances from J3 to Q4, and from Q4 to R12, are too small to allow a decent followup move other than diving for the corner, and it seems that diving for the corner would help black out quite a lot here.



What should white do?

-First of all white should not worry about black's wall. Black gains influence, but white has solid territory.

Furthermore white has a lot of choices where to approach black's 'moyo'. O3, R6 etc.]
;W[nq]LB[lq:a]C[I played this hoping black would play down, like Q2 or something, but I should have known better - black has the dual-purpose pincer-extension at A.



-you can indeed expect a pincer at  M3, but the follwup at white R6 seems reasonable, if black answers at P5, white dives in the corner, connecting with one of his two stones.]
;B[lq];W[qq]C[Oh geeze, here it is.  Black gets even more beautiful wall.

-I think R6 would be better, because white allready has territory, so white has to gain some influence.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[pn]C[Black 33 is to mild, he could have played R6]
;W[qn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[pm];B[om];W[pl];B[ol]
;W[ql]C[-White could have just walked with black at Q9];B[oi]
C[So now black has me quite shut in, and so much influence that I'm really nervous.

- I can understand your worries, but let's look at it from the bright side: you have 30+ actual secure territory, so now starts a battle for influence.]
;W[ci]C[Playing into the largest area - perhaps what I should have done instead of O3, or even O17?

-Maybe, but you are still able to play here.];B[fc];W[hc]C[I don't want black to get a C shape, so I pincered.]
;B[cc];W[cd]C[-Letting black this easily connect is too mediocre. I think D17 would be the proper reply, now black gets an easy game.]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[dg]LB[ge:a]C[Perhaps I should have played A instead.

- white 54 is too narrow a move, white shoul have palyed at g15 instead, connecting with 48.]
;B[fd];W[fe];B[ge];W[ff]
(;B[ie]C[i think this was a mistake.  IMO, black should have kept pushing down - see the variation at the previous move.

-i think you're right.];W[gf];B[he];W[gp]C[-good move!];B[gq]

;W[il];B[jl];W[im];B[jm];W[jn];B[io];W[hn]C[-Black has the lead and if he plays safely into the endgame, he will have no problems winning the game]
;B[rh];W[pk];B[ok];W[pj];B[oj];W[ec];B[eb]C[-P1 and P19 are sente moves for white and very big, so are B17 and C2.]
;W[bc]LB[cr:a][rj:b]C[Is this really the biggest move at this stage?  Maybe A is bigger?  Or B?]

;B[na];W[pa];B[nb];W[ab]C[-Black ley you play all the big endgame moves, thank you black, maybe he thought he was this far ahead that it didn't matter.]

;W[re];B[sc];W[rb];B[sb];W[ra];B[ba];W[ac];B[db]C[-?????];W[as]
;B[cs];W[aa];B[ir]C[-It beats me];C[The game is over.  Final score:

   White = 100 territory + 5 captures + 5.5 komi = 110.5

   Black = 117 territory + 4 captures = 121

Black wins by 10.5.



Maybe white 28 was the start of loosing the game, remember that influence is as important as territory, so mayne you will respond differently in the future.]
