C[Hello reviewer, please review the game for both sides. This game seemed like it went very bad for me (black) very quickly. Even though I eventually lost due to losing a major group, it seemed like I had fallen behind very early in the game due to some tactical errors.

csh: While the first fight went badly, I think there was still a way to get back in the game. I'll try to comment as the game progresses.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[eq];W[hp];B[en]C[I am not too familiar with the positions that come out of this, so I probably played this very wrong.

csh: Okay so far. The one-space jump is okay, too. The idea is to get the group out to the center.]
;W[ep]C[csh: This is odd, since it strengthens the black group.]
;B[fp]C[csh: Okay so far.];W[eo]C[csh: This is bad. After Black responds, White will be short on liberties.]
;B[fo]TR[eo][ep]C[csh: Now the marked white stones are short on liberties.]
;W[dq];B[do]LB[fq:A]C[csh: This isn't a good forcing move. It's a "thank you" move. It forces White to connect, but does not help deal with the cut at 'A.']
;W[dp];B[fq]TR[do][dp]C[csh: The trade of these two stones is better for White.]
;W[dn];B[kp]C[this may have been a bit premature.

csh: This move is okay. You can expect White to jump, and then the black group will need to run to the center. Essentially, it starts a running fight.]
;W[hn];B[dm];W[cn]
(;B[cm]LB[fn:A]C[I probably overreached here.

csh: Yes, protecting the cut at 'A' is critical. You should read out the cut before you played this move. See the variation.]
;W[fn];B[em];W[gn]TR[cm][dm][em][en]SQ[fo][fp][eq][fq]C[csh: After this, Black is cut in two. This is definitely to White's advance. White's corner group is alive, and the other group can run to the center.]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[hr];W[jp];B[jr];W[ko];B[lp];W[jq]C[csh: These moves use up liberties. I see that White is trying to take away Black's eyespace, but the group is out, and it's impossible to kill. Better to save the plays for later.]
;B[kr];W[ir];B[is];W[kq]C[csh: This forcing move is also bad, for similar reasons.]
;B[lq];W[hs];B[gs];W[io]C[csh: White has to protect because of the shortage of liberties.]

(;B[df]LB[ch:A]C[csh: This approach is bad. The problem is that if White establishes a group in the vicinity of 'A,' then both black groups will be under pressure. See the variation.]
;W[ch]
(;B[cd]C[Overreaching, again.

csh: I think the problem was the move before. This is making the best of a bad situation. See the variations.]
;W[ck];B[ek];W[eh];B[fc]C[csh: Black cannot attack in this position. With two weak groups on the board, Black will be in a disadvantage when White runs out.]
;W[ed]C[csh: Now what?]
(;B[ff];W[fd];B[gc]
(;W[cc];B[gd];W[bd];B[be];W[ce];B[cf];W[de];B[ee];W[dd];B[bf]
C[csh: White is already alive. While this protects against a peep, it does not help the group to escape to the center of the board.]
;W[fe]
(;B[ge]TR[ch][eh][ck]C[csh: The other group is more important. If the wall is cut through, Black cannot put any pressure on the marked white stones.]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[ee];W[gf];B[ef];W[fh];B[di]TR[ek][cm][dm]
[em][en]C[csh: This is a bad peep. Better to extended across the top of the board, or possibly run with the marked group. The marked group is in a lot of trouble, but threatening to connect to it might help reduce from the outside.]
;W[dh];B[ci]
(;W[ei]C[csh: This move doesn't accomplish much. See the variation.]
;B[bh];W[ej];B[dk];W[dj];B[cj];W[bg];B[ag]
(;W[bj]C[csh: This is a bad move.];B[bi];W[bk]
(;B[bl]C[csh: This move is also bad. White can't connect under. Take some time to read out the situation. You don't need to play at the same speed as your opponent. See the variation.]
;W[cg];B[aj];W[ak];B[ah]
(;W[ai];B[af];W[dg];B[aj]C[csh: This is still a tough ko for Black, as Black must ignore two threats.]

C[My group survived, but I seem to have lost a lot in the exchange

csh: Black may still live, but these moves will strengthen the white groups. There isn't as much at risk here, since White is already thick on the outside. If the white group was less secure, trying to live may strengthen white's group and increase his influence on the board. It may be better to sacrifice the group and play elsewhere.]
;W[cr];B[er]
(;W[gr]C[csh: This is a horrible move. Play from the outside to reduce eyespace. Only play at a "critical point" if you have read out the kill.]
;B[fr];W[hs];B[gq];W[nq]
(;B[np]TR[kp][lp][lq]C[csh: It is more important to make a base for the corner group. The three marked stones are all but captured. See the variation.]
;W[qn]C[and now my corner was in trouble.

csh: All the more reason not to try to save the three stones! :)]

(;B[qo]C[csh: This is the wrong move. Black is forcing White to seal off Black's corner.]
;W[pn];B[qj]TR[pn][qn]C[csh: Again, you can only attack when your groups are stronger than your opponents. The marked white stones have nothing to fear, as they can easily run to the center so they aren't under much pressure.]

C[csh: White still has a weak point at 'A' to be aware of. It may be hard to exploit, though, since the group can probably connect out to another group. Black must play the extension first, though.]
;W[ph];B[oj]C[this was probably wrong, but I didn't see too many better options. White had gained so much strength here it's hard to reply.
