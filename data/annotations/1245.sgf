;B[qg];W[qn];B[np];W[hq]C[Envious of B's territory. B has defended his corner on both sides of R6-R10 stones, so R8 now would be difficult to handle.]
;B[ql];W[on];B[ol];W[mn];B[lp];W[oj];B[ml]C[Good straightforward play by B, taking advantage of W's neglect to defend.

This kind of play may look simple, but the right moves can be quite difficult to choose from , as you have 3 running groups. Stick to the basic guidelines - attack what the opponent can't afford to sacrifice, watch for sente moves and vital points- especially mutual sente points, and keep in mind what you are after, that is, what you hope to gain from the chase (build territory or influence while chasing, help an isolated group of yours etc.)   You should play Q7 so W can't connect underneath with S8.]
;W[kn]C[You have 1 running group and W has 2, so the advantage is yours. However, W went ahead in territory with H3 move, so you need to gain from this chase. Note that the 4 B stones atthe bottom make no safe territory at the moment, so the primary way you should regard them is for attack, and maybe territory later with gote moves like J2 or S4, but only after the heat of the chase is somewhat settled. For now, these stones should be regarded as building territory at the TOP; that is, by pressing W's 6-line stoneswith your 8-line, you get to press his 10-line from above while building territory.
Once W plays L6, J5 becomes vital. It may go against some territorial instincts, investing another high move when H3 is waiting, but trust the theory of Go and aim for compensation at the top. besides, imagine a white stone at J5...]

(;B[mj]C[Seems logical, but in fact is a tact too soon.
You should not assume you will kill what you chase. And if W lives , his flight will reduce your potential territory at the top. see variation.]
;W[og];B[qf];W[mg];B[pi];W[pk];B[pl];W[oi];B[rj]C[I don't really see what you were aiming at here. your running group is doing ok , especially with N10 in place, and this move does not take away W's base - he has none...]
;W[io]C[The board looks different now, doesn't it ?];B[jo];W[jn]
;B[in]C[this is the only answer to W J5, but now you have 2 running groups, as does W (the R8 group needs 1 more move to connect safely).]
;W[ip]C[should be H5.];B[im];W[kl];B[ik];W[jl];B[il];W[kj];B[li]
C[P9 is needed first.];W[jj];B[hi];W[jh];B[lh]C[this is asking to be sealed in. If you want to seperate W , which is correct, play P9, W Q12, B M13. you could also play R11, which is big territorially and settles your group, let W play L13, reinforce your J-line stones (W G9 forcing move is painful) and maybe aim later at thw whole W group around your stones.]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[kh];B[hg];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk]C[W has the advantage now.]
;B[rk]C[R11 is better for the same purpose.];W[nd]C[W sould take his forcing move at G9.]
;B[ne]C[W is already settled, so this move invites W P16 etc. to live in the corner.]
;W[me]C[maybe W forgot that his group is settled...];B[nc]C[good.]
;W[oe]C[N17 was the only move for W, at least breaks B's territory.]
;B[od];W[nf];B[mc]C[very bad result for W. For once, the ponnuki is worthless. let's assess the game:
 B has 45 safe points at the top-and-right and 15+ at the bottom; W has 12 safe points in the middle and undetermined amount at the left, should be worth some 40 points. It's W's turn, so with komi and the G9 weakness I'd say game is in favor of W, but B has a chance, which he shouldn't have.]
;W[ij];B[hj];W[gk];B[cn]C[cheers for non-automatic move ! However, I doubt if this is good. The first thing to do here is to count the game and see what you need to win. As I said before, you have some 60 safe points. This stone is going to come under heavy attack, statrting with W C5, and you will end in gote; then W will reduce the bottom in sente, defend around D14 and will still have H9 to aim at. By my count, this means you lose, though not by much. If W lets you play R5, or if he plays K3 rather then K2, you have a chance.

Now, are the 4 J-line stones dead weight ? seem to me that if they are connected, they aid invasion around F3. So I'd play C14 first - this has some chance to end in sente since the D16 stones will need a base, and you have better help there from your H-line stones. then I'd connect at H9. If W defends, say at D5, I'd go for F3. Tell the truth, W still has better chances. But I'd go this way.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[hk]
(;B[ci]C[??

since W cut immediately, it means you should live with D6 stones - that would threat to connect the 4 stones, making H9 worthless, so W will probably defend his kill; then you go to reduce the top. see variation.

This move encourages W to take the whole bottom-left quarter with C10, and your C11 is left  very weak.]

;W[bn];B[fn];W[do];B[hh];W[gf]C[good result for B. E13 and D14 are sente, then F4 and R5. let W have H13 stones.]
;B[eg];W[fg];B[cf];W[ed];B[if]C[poor shape and does not save the stones.
R5 is needed and bigger.
F4 etc. is important to ensure connection to the 4 stones (Imagine W G8, then G7).
The right move locally is J15.];W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[je]
;B[jd];W[ge];B[gc];W[ke]C[Game over...];B[fq];W[gl];B[fl];W[hn]
;B[hm];W[gm];B[ho];W[gn];B[hp];W[iq];B[fo];W[gp]C[not the right way, L2 enough, then S4 etc.]

;B[dr];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[bg];W[ae];B[bf];W[mq]C[with the added weakness at L3, B is too thin.   This was a good fighting game. Important I believe you will benefit from observing :
1. practice in building eye shape for weak stones.
2. watch for vital points such as J5.
3. when starting an initiative in a new place on the board, try to assess if you will end in gote or sente (don't despair - even the strong players have dificulty here !)
4. count the game at important strategic turning points, and estimate what you need to win. This will improve your grip on the course of the game, and even improve your ability to learn from your mistakes (do you have a feeling sometimes that the game is running wild on you ? ... )
5. try to get a feeling for things like the thinness the K4-Q5 formation once all those enemy stones are around, and for bad shape moves like J14.

You have a good solid base for your Go, good luck in your studies !

Best wishes,

C[this seems to give reasonable chance yo win.
There are many possibilities, of course, e.g. W playing F6 sooner, B F7, and a fight - I'm not sure what will happen.]
