RE[W+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[White(spinor) won this game decisively; however, both of us(spinor and Solstace) are effectively beginners and do not yet understand what we are doing.  Much of the text from the chat we had were preserved, but a few irrelevant comments were removed.

Hello, I reviewed the game for you focusing on some of the bigger things. Of course all of the battles and infighting had mistakes and could have gone either way, so I didn't go through them, for the most part a move elsewhere would have been more valuable than continuing the fight in every situation. Comments and variations are intersperesd throughout with some suggestions on improving at the very end. I hope you enjoy!

~Ben, Jonahx];B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp]C[This opening was fine for both - you may not understand why these moves are good, but  that's ok for now. 

They effectively exert influence both on the corner (where it is easiest to make territory) and towards the outside.]
;B[ej]LB[ak:1][bk:2][ck:3][dk:4][ek:5]C[Usually you don't want to play on the 5th line in the opening; it's too easy for the oponent to slip under. It exerts a great ammonut of influence on the outside - but you should remember to guide your play by "corner, sides, center" It's easiest to make territory in the corner, that's the most valuable, so that's why we play there first - then the sides, then hardest to make territory is in the center, so moves that aim there aren't as valuable, and should be played later]
(;W[ek]C[No need for white to respond in this way, the black stone is not a threat to anything. You generally want to avoid touching an opponents stone unless you have a very good reason for doing so since it makes the stone you touched stronger.The variation would be fine for white.]
(;B[el]C[So here, there's no real need for black to respond, nothing is urgent, and in the opening there are plays that are much more valuable. In genreal, when your stone gets touched, you should extend if you are  weaker, and hane if you are stronger, or equal. "Squeezing" (the term for this play, see how it looks like a white sandwich?) isn't so good here, you have let white split you in half, no good.]
;W[dl];B[dk]C[So here begins a giant cross-cut fight, no move here would be as valuable as playing somehwere else. 

Just a general note in fights though is to take care of weak stones, or ones that don't have a place to run (next to the side)]
(;W[fk];B[dm];W[cl]
(;B[em];W[dj];B[ck];W[cj]C[Solstace [21k?\]: Clever.
spinor [?\]: oh wait I could have laddered
Solstace [21k?\]: I don't think you could hav.
spinor [?\]: either way, not a bad position, I think];B[gl]
C[spinor [?\]: glad this isn't a timed game
Solstace [21k?\]: Haha.
spinor [?\]: although you're right about the ladder, it would have atari'd one of my pieces so it wouldn't've worked
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah, you don't have a ladder breaker set up.
spinor [?\]: ladder breaker is for the one getting laddered
spinor [?\]: this just wasn't a proper ladder setup
Solstace [21k?\]: Oh.
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah.];W[fj];B[ei]C[spinor [?\]: hmm
spinor [?\]: what do I want to even do];W[eh];B[fi];W[gi];B[gj]
;W[bk];B[gh];W[hi];B[fh]C[Solstace [21k?\]: this is a weird set-up.
spinor [?\]: well, neither of us actually know what we're doing, so]
;W[hj]C[Solstace [21k?\]: I just had a genius idea that will probably bite me in the ass.
spinor [?\]: Let's try this.];B[gk];W[hl];B[dk];W[ck];B[fl]
;W[dk]C[Solstace [21k?\]: forcing moves are fun

The white group is alive , but the forcing moves do give black some strength on the outside, which is the best they can do with this situation, though playing on the side or corner is still more valuable. (Have I drilled that point home yet? :)]
;B[di]C[spinor [?\]: I wonder how alive that group is.
Solstace [21k?\]: You have no eyes.
Solstace [21k?\]: So it's still up for grabs.
spinor [?\]: Yeah, but I have the side.];W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[dh]
(;W[eg]C[spinor [?\]: dunno if that's even worth saving];B[bm]
;W[cm];B[cn];W[bn]
(;B[al];W[bl]C[spinor [?\]: a7 would have been a blunder];B[am]
;W[an]C[spinor [?\]: probably a waste of a move there, come to think of it
spinor [?\]: I guess it protected b6 in a sense
Solstace [21k?\]: Ah, shit.
Solstace [21k?\]: You live.
spinor [?\]: I should do tsumego so that I have a better sense of when things live or die.
Solstace [21k?\]: My little thing at A8 is dead.  Which is pretty much 2 eyes right there.]
;B[dn]C[spinor [?\]: Well, when I said I didn't know how alive that cluster was, I wasn't sure about my ability to extend it to the point where those pieces can be shielded
Solstace [21k?\]: ?]
(;W[jo]C[
This is better - though playing on the 4th or 3rd line would be better still

Solstace [21k?\]: Okay, no matter what I'd have played, that group was dead.
Solstace [21k?\]: If I would have played A9, you'd play A10 to kill it.
spinor [?\]: I said that I had the side.  If you have enough on the side, you can get three or four and produce life.
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah.
Solstace [21k?\]: A stronger player would have still been able to kill it.
Solstace [21k?\]: But I'm not that strong ZD
spinor [?\]: possibly/probably, yeah];B[bo];W[ak];B[cq]C[Solstace [21k?\]: Actually, I may still be able to kill that group....
Solstace [21k?\]: ...
Solstace [21k?\]: I think I can.
spinor [?\]: what, A9?
Solstace [21k?\]: So I'm going to go for it.];W[co]C[Solstace [21k?\]: I shouldn't have just told you that.
Solstace [21k?\]: Oh.
Solstace [21k?\]: My tudn.];B[am];W[bm];B[bi];W[ai]C[Solstace [21k?\]: Ooooh, this is the tricky part....
spinor [?\]: pretty sure by 'tricky' you mean 'impossible'
Solstace [21k?\]: Possibly.
spinor [?\]: anything but b10 and I move there
spinor [?\]: and if you move on b10 I move on a10
spinor [?\]: since, you know, I have nothing actually in atari
spinor [?\]: your move, btw
Solstace [21k?\]: I'm just going to be sacrificing stones like no tomorrow in this game....]
(;B[bj];W[aj];B[bi];W[ah]C[spinor [?\]: Two.  Eyes.
Solstace [21k?\]: Alright.
Solstace [21k?\]: Now I"m convinced.
Solstace [21k?\]: I didn't see that move you just played.
Solstace [21k?\]: Moving onward.];B[dp]C[spinor [?\]: I just played A12 so that that stone up there wouldn't be isolated
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah.
Solstace [21k?\]: If that stone was isolated, I could kill it.]
;W[bp]C[Solstace [21k?\]: I didn't even think about the A12 one.]
;B[do]C[spinor [?\]: I'd still've ended up with two eyes.];W[ao]
C[Solstace [21k?\]: No, you'd have one real one, and one fake one.
spinor [?\]: I'm thinking K5 might've been better a little closer to your wall, a little more aggressive.
Solstace [21k?\]: I think.
spinor [?\]: maybe
spinor [?\]: whatever];B[hk]C[spinor [?\]: hmmm
spinor [?\]: is j9 worth a stone];W[jk];B[il];W[hm];B[in]C[spinor [?\]: I probably shouldn't actually attack that mass; it'll probably get two eyes
Solstace [21k?\]: Rather quickly, I'd imagine.];W[ik];B[im]
;W[hn];B[io];W[ho];B[jn]C[Solstace [21k?\]: This is such a disjointed game, on my end.
spinor [?\]: disjointed?
Solstace [21k?\]: Like, I'm mostly just trying different methods out.
Solstace [21k?\]: Hence why I don't actually have any eyes yet.]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[ko]C[spinor [?\]: I don't know how much "method" I'm doing.]
;B[hp];W[iq];B[go]C[spinor [?\]: no way I can win that race]
;W[kq];B[kn];W[kp];B[gp]C[spinor [?\]: and worse, that'll be an eye :(
Solstace [21k?\]: Several, actually.
spinor [?\]: if I can do anything on the southwest it'd be to snatch up some  corner territory, I think
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah, pretty much];W[dq]C[spinor [?\]: might as well do that I guess]
;B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[es]C[spinor [?\]: probably all I can eke out
Solstace [21k?\]: I think so.
spinor [?\]: I think d1 is an endgame-type move
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah.];W[pj]C[Good!];B[pg];W[ph]C[Again, touching another stone only makes it stronger]
;B[qh];W[qi];B[oh];W[pi]C[spinor [?\]: I don't yet have much in the way of strategy, I'm just going the move that I think looks best]
;B[mh]C[spinor [?\]: which probably means very little at this superbeginner level

These responses are very good for black, they build a wall which starts surrounding territory on the top]
;W[mk]C[White gets a wall towards the bottom, but he was going to anyways, and remember, the black stones at J6 are alive (becuase they can capture white at H6) so that territory is useless for white.]
(;B[ih]
(;W[kh]
(;B[kg];W[jg];B[ij];W[ii];B[jj];W[ji]C[spinor [?\]: hmm, I think m9 would have been better
spinor [?\]: no
Solstace [21k?\]: It's not.
spinor [?\]: right, it would have killed that];B[jh]C[spinor [?\]: hmm
Solstace [21k?\]: I have several things I'm trying to accomplish right now.]
;W[hh];B[ig]C[spinor [?\]: hmm, there's that atari too, but do I really care about it
spinor [?\]: I'm not sure if I'll be able to make any leeway at the top whatsoever.
spinor [?\]: so I'll make the more conservative move];W[kj]
(;B[hg]C[Solstace [21k?\]: Oh, for the record, I think you're almost definitely going to win this.]
;W[jf]LB[mn:A][qq:B]C[spinor [?\]: I'm not as sure.
Solstace [21k?\]: You have 17.5 points more than me as it is.
Solstace [21k?\]: :/

My score estimate here give w +10.5, very possible to still make up, especially since black can still invade at A and B]
;B[ke];W[gg]C[spinor [?\]: let's take a risk

This is good now, can cut off either the E11 stones or the H12 stones]
(;B[fg]C[Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah, I saw that cut coming a while ago.]
;W[gf];B[ef];W[dg];B[cg]C[spinor [?\]: I probably won't win it though.
Solstace [21k?\]: Don't think so.
Solstace [21k?\]: You lose this ladder.
spinor [?\]: yeah
Solstace [21k?\]: All of my groups are shaped really defensively.
spinor [?\]: though I wonder if I can exploit that ladder to pull out some territory
Solstace [21k?\]: But will the territory gained offset the stones lost?
spinor [?\]: The stones are pretty much already lost.
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah, that's the point.
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah, just did a quick territory estimate.
Solstace [21k?\]: After factoring in captures and komi, you have something close to 20 definitive points.
Solstace [21k?\]: I have 5.
Solstace [21k?\]: Oh, wait.
spinor [?\]: well, there's the dead group in the southwest
Solstace [21k?\]: Forgot about the captures that I haven't take.
Solstace [21k?\]: *taken
Solstace [21k?\]: So, about 13 points for you.
Solstace [21k?\]: The southest is alive, though.
spinor [?\]: I meant my dead group
Solstace [21k?\]: What dead group.
spinor [?\]: the four stones just sitting there
Solstace [21k?\]: Ok.
spinor [?\]: I guess that doesn't count as a group
Solstace [21k?\]: Oh.
Solstace [21k?\]: That line?
Solstace [21k?\]: At H8?
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah, I accounted for that.];W[be];B[cf];W[bf]
;B[bg];W[ag]C[spinor [?\]: yeah, that didn't work out as planned]
;B[ad];W[ae];B[bd];W[de];B[ce]C[spinor [?\]: oh wait that doesn't work
Solstace [21k?\]: Don't you hate it when that happens?
spinor [?\]: yeah
Solstace [21k?\]: I make those mistakes all the time IRL.
spinor [?\]: I haven't played IRL.];W[ff];B[af]C[Solstace [21k?\]: Oh.
Solstace [21k?\]: Now I see what you're doing.
spinor [?\]: I'm having to change plans mid-stream.
Solstace [21k?\]: Yeah.
Solstace [21k?\]: But I understand the purpose of that last move.
spinor [?\]: It's probably not very good at what it's doing, but yeah, I have plans for that gorup
spinor [?\]: group];W[gd];B[fd];W[fc];B[ee]C[spinor [?\]: yeah, that one's pretty solid now]
;W[ge];B[ec]C[Solstace [21k?\]: God, these 19x19 games go on forever.
Solstace [21k?\]: We might have to come back to it tomorrow.

spinor [?\]: I guess I should speed things up.];W[nh];B[ng]
;W[jd];B[je];W[if]C[spinor [?\]: I still don't have a good sense strategically of what I should be doing, in general.
Solstace [21k?\]: Hey, you're beating me.
spinor [?\]: Tactically I can probably put myself above 30k on goproblems so I don't get that "artistic" tsumego.
Solstace [21k?\]: pffft

spinor [?\]: yeah];B[gc];W[fb];B[gb];W[fa];B[ga]C[spinor [?\]: and I screwed up most of my Northern gains
Solstace [21k?\]: I think I just got lucky.

This game was good for beginners, well done to both of you, definitely stick with it, you both have good sense of what moves should look like and a basic understanding of how to play and where.

Definitely look at some more fuseki (openings) to get some ideas for where to play after the first four moves. You don't need to study Joseki (corner patterns) yet or anything, but it's very easy to learn the 3-3 invasion, and how to approach a corner stone, and the response to that approach (at this point really just learn those two moves, 1. the approach 2. the first response) you can make it up from there until you're more comfortable.

Remember a couple of things 

1. First corners, second sides, third center
2. Don't touch an opponents stone unless you want to make it stronger, or don't care about making it stronger.

Following those two principles and you've both gained a stone at least.

I think it's pretty cool you can play GO at school! some resources I've found helpful:

senseis.xmp.net - go wiki
goproblems.com
the GTL of course - check out games from people around 10-15 k, they will be insightful

I've been playing very intermitently for about 5 years (though more recently) and moved from 21k to 5k, so keep on trucking!]
