C[White forms mini chinese formation.. very common see in two handicap game.
if white can use this mini chinese opening to attack and form some territory it will be a success for white. That is the characteristic of the mini chinese or chinese opening.]
;B[jq];W[qn]LB[pk:C][pl:B][np:A]C[[question one\]:  joseki choice.  maybe pincer better?

A: at this stage, which joseki to choose is not so important.. It depends at your style. The game you played at A, I think it is good.. you also could consider pincer at B or C. But I think overall, choosing which joseki is not something that will affect the outcome of the game. especially early in this stage.]
;B[np]C[black forms a nice formation at lower side. Looks very nice.]
;W[pj];B[qh]LB[ic:C][jc:B][qh:A]C[[question two:\] after white 11 and white 13, this move became inefficient.  so maybe i should play black 10 on the top side instead?

I think your question lies with consistency. The purpose of playing at A is to attack the two white stone at the right side. 

But as for your question, black play at B or C is also possible.

Explanation cont'd at next move.];W[nc]C[white appraoches like this forces black to consider defend the corner.
White's aim is to develop quickly to catch up the 2 stone advantages.]

(;B[lc]SQ[pd][qh]C[This pincer is where i find questionable. first of all the marked 2 stone have quite a distance between them, it makes them thinner when white jumps.
I think it is possible for black to be consistant about the orginal meaning of R12 and go direct attacking.

see variation.];W[ne];B[og]LB[oh:A]SQ[pd][qh]C[I understand that you are trying to separate white here.. but however, I don't like the shape of this move. Because the relations between the marked stone is very weak,, it made white have a possibility to separate black as well.
Overall I think A would be better since it keep more pressure on the two stone at the right also it have a better shape. 

Locally it have become tough for black since there is so much aji left behind with this shape.]

(;W[jc]LB[kd:A]C[Fighting move, thinking to create messy fight. I think white also can consider choosing A
The game, this is a much more aggressive way of playing for white.

;B[lg];W[nh]
(;B[ni]C[hane creates immediate trouble for black.. since it forces white to M12 right away,, I would like to just go simple at P11

;W[of];B[pf];W[mj];B[nk];W[ig]C[after this,, i think white went quite successful here.]
;B[oe];W[nf];B[nd];W[md];B[od]SQ[nd][oe]C[I don't like this 3 exchanges,, i feel like it's aji cashi, (taking away the aji too early.]

(;W[mc]C[White connect here is weird, I would connected the other side.
see variation.];B[me];W[ld];B[ji];W[jh]C[Overplayed by white,,]
;B[kj];W[li]C[[question three\] Here, I think I should play L9, yes?  If that works, the game would have been a whole lot easier for me.
Yes, you were right,, if L9 then you coulda capture the white stones.]

;B[nm];W[km];B[kl];W[jl];B[jk];W[lm];B[ij];W[il]C[Until this point.. black came out ok, overall if black can invade the upper left and also do something to the right side two white stone,, black will then still have a great chance of winning.
the focus is how would black do to settle the center group while reduce the white's moyo and also gain sente.

My preference is followed show in variations.]
