C[D:  Hello Vernon,

My name is Darrell.  I've made some comments.  Generally, you did well and the game was surprisingly even in spite of losing the large group in the lower left corner until the endgame.]
;B[pd]C[vernon: white is much stronger than black, so this game was not rated. I was black, and was pleased with my result, even though I lost. I played for safety, and I should have risked more.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[hc]LB[ic:a]C[D:  move 9 should be at 'a'.  Otherwise, very normal opening.]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[ic:a]C[vernon: perhaps a pincer?

D:  Perhaps.  If 9 were at 'a', I would like this move better, but still it is fine.  Your top left corner is very strong at the moment, so driving white toward it is ok.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jc];B[ge]LB[jd:a][id:b][ie:c][he:d]C[D:  Moving out is good, but perhaps you could threaten the top white group more at the same time with one of these moves]
;W[di];B[cn];W[cl];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr]
;W[gq];B[en]C[vernon: I did not want to lose C6 either.];W[bp]
;B[bq];W[eo];B[fn];W[fo];B[fl]C[D:  looks good.  I like this move.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[do];B[cm];W[gr];B[jq]C[vernon: I felt that the B3 group was still alive and that this was a big point.

D:  Yes, you were right about it being a big point, but your group should die I believe.  Generally, if you can't tell if a group is going to live or die, and it's surrounded, you should defend it.]
;W[aq];B[ar];W[fs]
(;B[dr]C[vernon: mistake. Could black to B1 have saved the core of the group? I think so, but am not certain.

D:  Yes, B1 at this point saves most of the group.];W[bs]LB[br:a]
C[D:  White should just play at 'a'  and kill the group simply.]
;B[cs];W[br]LB[es:a]C[D:  A move at 'a' now makes the group live.  See variation.]

(;B[cr];W[es];B[pj]C[vernon: I give up on B3 and take a big point.

D:  Yes, very big.];W[mq];B[kp];W[mo];B[kn];W[lo]
(;B[ko]C[D:  This move was not needed.  You could either sacrifice stone 53 or defend the cut more efficiently.  See variations 2 and 3.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[qr];B[rr];W[pq];B[rp];W[op];B[po]C[white has split K3 and Q4 and begins pressure on K3.

D:  Yes.  White is now strong and you have two weak groups in the bottom center and the lower left.]
;W[oo];B[lr]C[vernon: I know that this strengthens Q3, but it starts a base around K3.]
;W[mr];B[on]C[D:  good.];W[lq];B[kq]LB[kr:a]C[D:  why not at 'a'?]
;W[nn];B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[hn]C[vernon: This splits D7 and K3, and begins pressure on both.

D:  right.  This hurts.];B[hm];W[gn];B[gm];W[im];B[kl];W[in]
;B[dk]C[vernon: this presses down on the left side to try to strengthen D7.]
;W[ck];B[fj];W[dj];B[ej];W[dl];B[el]C[D:  Good.  You have pulled this group out.]
;W[ek]
(;B[fk]C[D:  This move was not needed.  See variation.];W[il]
;B[dg]C[vernon: again, pressing down on the left in order to connect D7 to F17.]
;W[cg];B[fh];W[dh];B[eh];W[eg];B[fg];W[ef];B[ff]C[vernon: D7 is now connected, but white has made territory.

D:  Yes.];W[ee];B[nf]C[vernon: starting a moya here on the right for territory.

D:  Very good.  And you attack white's only weak group.];W[me]
;B[mf];W[ml]C[vernon: white squeezes K3.];B[kj];W[mj]C[D:  White is threatening your weak group.  You can be cut.  See variation on next move.]
;B[ni]LB[ob:a]C[vernon: Black threatens to connect Q16 to K3 in order to gain more territory on the right.

D:  This strikes me as small.  

First importance:  White is threatening your weak group.  You can be cut.  See variation.

Another big move:  You could continue to make territory while attacking.  Your upper right corner is still open to invasion at R17.   A move at 'a' threatens white's group on the top and takes huge profit.]

(;W[mi];B[nh];W[ij];B[kh];W[lg];B[ji];W[ii];B[ih]C[vernon: L10 is now able to connect to F17, but K3 is not connected to L10.

D:  Right.];W[jg];B[jh];W[kg];B[ig]LB[jk:a][mh:b][ob:c]C[D:  ???

How about one of these moves?];W[lf];B[if]C[D:  same comment.]
;W[je]C[vernon: white takes good profit from black's need to connect.]
;B[hs]C[vernon: black fears that L8 is too weak, and starts building eye space around K3.]
;W[gs]C[vernon: perhaps H2 would have been better?];B[hr];W[hq]
C[vernon: at this point, L2 for white does not work.];B[ir]
;W[iq]C[vernon: here K2 does not work for white.];B[jr];W[km]
;B[lm];W[jm];B[ks]C[vernon: I play for certain life, but I could have played on at M8. If white M6 to cut, then L1 for life. If white L1, then black M6 connects.

D:  I like the way you played better.];W[ll]C[D:  I think it is an even game at this point.  Look at variation 2 for a simple set of endgame type moves and an estimate for the score.  Really, from here on is where you lost the game.]

(;B[kk]C[D:  Much too small.  Saving one useless stone.];W[ln]
;B[nk];W[mk]C[vernon: perhaps white R17 is right here.];B[nj]
C[vernon: black should have defended the upper right corner. Maybe R17 or Q18. But I have tried to play R17 and it seems that white still wins by 15 stones.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[ob];B[pb];W[pc]C[vernon: black is in trouble.]
;B[qb];W[od];B[oe]C[vernon: perhaps S17 would have been better here to save the corner.

D:  Absolutely.  Huge difference.];W[rc];B[rd];W[sd];B[rb];W[sc]
;B[se]C[vernon: bad play here. But even with good play, the game is lost.]
;W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[pe];W[sf];B[qf];W[se];B[rh];W[sg];B[sh]
;W[rg];B[qg];W[oa];B[ib]C[vernon: black now has a good Ko threat at T18. Where could I have played to try to even the score? M16?

D:  Giving up that corner was too big to overcome I'm afraid.]
;W[jb];B[cb];W[bb];B[ed];W[fd];B[ec];W[fe];B[gd];W[ce]C[vernon: another good Ko threat at D15, but no Ko likely.]
;B[hf]C[vernon: perhaps J9 to split J10 from J8?];W[gi];B[gh]
