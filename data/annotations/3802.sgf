C[krv: I'm playing black here. I've insert some questions but 
I'm sure that you can see some my mistakes which now are hidden from me.
Thank you for your time and attention];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc]

(;B[jd]C[This is very unusual, in general a komuku stone is approachted from 
the other side. I personally like more the variation because it works good 
in combination with your hoshi.];W[nq];B[lq]C[krv: Situations like this arises frequently in my games. I'm 
interesting is this move best. I also like K4, C10, Q10.

L: there is nothing wrong with this move];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp]
;B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn];B[om]LB[ql:D][pn:C][ep:A]
[fp:B]C[krv: Is there good to play tenuki (C10, 
R11, H3 or G3)?

L: -your move is ok, but you can choose to play tenuki
i think p7 is played to construct a moyo, if you won't play a follow up move 
around 'a' then you shouldn't play p7 and leave the opportunity to play 'c' 
or 'd' at some time.
-  c10 i don't like, in my old fashioned vision of fuseki it is better to 
prevent a shimari
-g 3 is to close to your thickness, Ba or Bb are better
- r 10 is also less urgent i think];W[qm]
(;B[cj]C[L: the variations seem more logic in combination with your 
thickness and with p7];W[eq]C[L: seriously limits your influence]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[ed]
(;B[qh]LB[qf:B][qg:A]C[L: this stone would have been better placed at 'a' or 
'b' considering the invasion that followed];W[nc]
(;B[pc]C[krv: How to play here? May be P17?];W[lc];B[jc]C[L: this would be a good stone if you had a position in the upper 
left, now it feels heavy, therefore i think q17 was maybe not your best 
move];W[mf];B[fc];W[fe]
(;B[jf];W[ke]
(;B[if]C[L: heavy and bad shape];W[hd];B[id];W[hc]
(;B[og];W[kf];B[fg];W[gg];B[gf];W[ff];B[hg];W[gh];B[eg];W[kh]

(;B[hh]C[krv: seems like I missed very good adji here?
L: yes, forcing once would have been good since this is a so called 'double 
sente' move: these moves should be played very quick];W[ge]
;B[hf];W[gi];B[ij];W[gk]
(;B[lg]C[L: this feels early since you strenghten white and this might give 
difficulties for your center group. The variation shows an other idea]
;W[kg];B[mg];W[nf];B[mi];W[kj];B[hj];W[gj]
(;B[il]C[krv: From here any moment I can play M14,M15,O16 (I've played this 
later). Which moment is adequate? Seems like I've played this too late.
L: now it would be to quick, you must fist give your center group some 
security, but be aware that there was some bad aji at the end of your 
variation (see var)];W[ji];B[jh];W[jg];B[ih];W[kl];B[li];W[ki]
;B[in];W[di];B[ci];W[cl]
(;B[ek];W[el];B[dk]
(;W[dl]C[krv: mistake?
L: possible, but it might also be an intentional sacrifice. white gains some 
teritory and is likely to end in sente.];B[fl];W[gl];B[fm];W[gm]
;B[gn];W[fn];B[fo];W[en];B[fk];W[go];B[hn];W[gp]LB[ob:A][nd:B]
C[L: this looks like a good timing to put pressure on 
the white group by playing 'a' for example (or maybe 'b')];B[iq]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[bi];B[bh];W[bj];B[ck];W[bk];B[em];W[dn]
(;B[ln];W[bg];B[cg];W[ah];B[ei];W[of]
(;B[pg]C[krv: Is here good O16?
L:  the black and white territorys are here more or les equal so therefore i 
think you played the 'honte' move. If you have less confidence in your 
endgame you could try your variation but i think it leaves more bad aji for 
black. I would opt for beginning the endgame now.];W[ob];B[pb]
;W[pa]C[L: the endgame has started. A quick estimation gives white 68 black 
62, this is not accurate but it learns that black will certainly lose if he 
playes submissive.]
(;B[qa];W[oa];B[qb];W[hq];B[ir];W[ip]
(;B[jp];W[hr]
(;B[bf]C[krv: H1?

L: yes, because it is also a double sente move.];W[is];B[jr]
;W[js]
(;B[kr]C[L: this is a mistake. many players make this kind of overcautious 
moves in the endgame. But they cost points, there was no reason not to block 
directly.];W[kn]
(;B[lf]C[krv: Can I capture white? This problem is too complex to me.
L: white seems to be alive: see your variations wich i changed a bit.]
;W[le];B[nd];W[md];B[oc];W[mb];B[lk];W[kk];B[lm];W[km];B[ko]
LB[ac:B][qk:A]C[L: the point at 'a' seems bigger, if you play here you 
increase your area and also prevent white from playing there and increasing 
his.
The monkey jump at 'b' is also becoming urgent and normaly this move is 
sente];W[io];B[jo]C[L: same remark, your move here has little use]
;W[jn];B[hl];W[qj]TR[jo]C[L: white got the important point first, this is a serious 
loss, caused by the triangled stone];B[pk];W[ri]
(;B[pj]C[krv: S12 better?
L: yes, you seem obsessed by your territory in the center. When i evaluate a 
position i am always confused by center territory, it always appears to be 
bigger than it actually is.
You must try to estimate how many points you lose if you let white penetrate 
your center a bit or let white penetrate your side by a big bit. The loss 
you suffer here is huge];W[rh];B[rg];W[rf];B[qf];W[sg];B[re]

;W[la];B[rg];W[os];B[ns];W[qg];B[qi]C[krv: Should I continue ko-fight?
L: there is little hope left: white has many treats against your center 
territory and he is leading already, the game is lost];W[rg]
;B[pf];W[qk];B[ag];W[ib]
(;B[dd]C[krv: A17?
L: off course, on the other hand you are behind by some twenty points so you 
can only hope for some complication];W[cc];B[ps];W[ll];B[ml]

;B[ee];W[fd];B[jm];W[ef];B[im];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[L: final remarks:
-in the fuseki you didn't approach the white komuku's from the right 
direction and failed to construct a moyo
- remember the leaning move to attack a group
- in the endgame you failed to play the big jose-points and let your 
stronger opponent take them all, this certainly cost you the game.
In the jose you lost some 20 points so if this game is representative you 
can improve a lot there.];TW[aa][ca][ea][fa][ga][ha][ia][ja]
