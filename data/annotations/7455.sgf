;B[pd]C[I played as Black in this game, which I lost by 2.5 points.  I have some questions regarding the game, and please point out any mistakes I have made.  Thank you!

[Frank\] Hello.  I will be reviewing this game.  I just looked it over quickly and it appears that you were doing fine until W started to overplay.  I will go into those in more detail.  My comments are prefixed [Frank\].  Hope this helps!]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[pj]C[I think this maybe a bad move.  Maybe D2 or K4 is better.

[Frank\] I don't think this is terrible.  There is not an obvious move W can play to attack your F3 stone directly.  It is true that if W plays in the bottom left he will take a big chunk of that corner, but Q10 is a very large move also.]
;W[nq];B[jp]C[[Frank\] I like this move :)  I'm sure you played it because it simultaneously supports your F3 stone and pincers the O3 stone.]
;W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[[Frank\] Good direction.  See variation for why.];W[qp]
;B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn]TR[om][np]C[[Frank\] B may play one more move to finish joseki.  Either of the marked moves are fine.]
;B[jd]C[Should I have played around F17 or maybe D2? Perhaps even F5?

[Frank\] I listed some joseki possibilities in the last move.  Your move here is not terrible.]
;W[pn];B[on];W[om]
(;B[nn]C[[Frank\] To me, this is where I felt you started to lose some momentum.  Anytime you have the opportunity to double hane, you should try to read into it as much as you can.]
;W[pl];B[pf];W[np]C[[Frank\] Unreasonable by W.  Your goal here is to ensure that he is left with a weak group and you are not.]

[Frank\] Yes :)];W[jm];B[iq];W[kq];B[jq];W[kr];B[ks];W[jr];B[ir]
;W[km];B[fc];W[cf]C[[Frank\] How about something around C10 here?]

(;B[cq];W[dj];B[oc];W[db]C[I regretted this move.  Maybe F15 is the best?

[Frank\] A little bit late.  See the variation on move 66.]
;B[hd];W[ph];B[nh];W[rh]C[This was unexpected.  I was hoping W would poke out at P11 so I can build up the moyo at the top.  Maybe I should have peeped at R13 and attack the group?]
;B[oh]C[I played this almost instictively?  Is there any better response than this?

[Frank\] You have strange instincts :)  I think playing to protect the corner might have been bigger.  (That is, the R13 peep)]
;W[rf];B[rd];W[pg];B[of];W[pi];B[cl]C[Should this have been around D12 so can can press down on the left side while developing my moyo at the top?]

;W[dk];B[hb];W[ca];B[ea]C[My endgame calculations are usually horrible.  Is there a different endgame sequence that I could have played to come out on top?  Thank you for your time.

[Frank\] There were a few, but the more important parts happened earlier on.  One of the biggest barriers at your level is learning how to handle overplay.  W had some key overplays this game and I don't think he was properly punished.]

[nq]C[[Frank\] This is a possible result.  W is left with an annoyingly heavy group.  He will need to spend several moves to create 2 eyes.  Although you probably cannot kill him, he will strengthen you in whatever direction he chooses to push.  Further, you can likely end in sente and play F17 or D10, which are both very large moves at the moment.]

(;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]TR[jp][lq]SQ[fq]C[[Frank\] You would otherwise end up with this, which although is a large moyo, leaves you with this where you'd prefer K4 at M3 and F3 losing some of its effectiveness (since it is not making much profit on the bottom side).  W's next move here will likely be around the O16 area.]
