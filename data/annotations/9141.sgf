C[[Agi\] Hi, I'm Aginyan, KGS 2k, and i'll be reviewing this game. I'll be tagging my comments accordingly throughout the review]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[eq];B[cp];W[dm];B[do];W[gp];B[dq];W[ep]
;B[dr];W[kq];B[qo]C[[Agi\] Taking the corner is important here since black doesn't have much room to expand down the side any more. Overall the position seems playable.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[kd]
(;B[cf]C[[Agi\] Coming in was probably the biggest move, C14 seems to be the most common move]
;W[de];B[bd];W[ch];B[df];W[ce];B[be];W[cc];B[ff];W[bg];B[bf]
;W[gd];B[dh];W[di];B[ci];W[eh]C[[Agi\] White seems to be deciding to let black live in exchange for sente]
;B[dg];W[cj];B[bi];W[dj];B[bh]TR[bj][bk]C[[Agi\] The triangle exchange might be unnecessary, black is quite alive already so saving it for the future is probably useful]
;W[qh]C[[Agi\] White is using sente to make this severe approach]
;B[qg];W[ph];B[nd];W[md]LB[pc:A][nf:B]TR[nd]C[[Agi\] This exchange doesn't seem good for black, it solidifies white's top, but doesn't help black get stronger. Something around A or B would get the job done more directly.]
;B[ne];W[ql]C[[Agi\] And white settles the side group... Black really wanted to get a stone around r10 but was worried about the corner.  It might be possible to fight it out but it's complicated.]
;B[mq]LB[oc:B][qc:A]C[[Agi\] Now that white is settled on the right side, her hands are free to attack the group in the corner, which still is vulnerable. Black should have fixed with something like B]
;W[qc];B[pc]LB[qd:A]C[[Agi\] Because of all the nearby white stones, Q17 is probably slightly better than A. Still, the end result no matter what is bad for black]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]C[[Agi\] really painful to let white live in that corner]
;B[nb];W[mc];B[oc];W[re]
(;B[of]C[[Agi\] This move isn't doing enough, it's focused on protecting an eye that's mostly safe.]
;W[rg]C[[Agi\] White connects and secures her groups];B[le]
;W[jc]
(;B[mb]LB[rf:B][iq:A]C[[Agi\] Small, especially since it doesn't help give black a second eye without another move. The invasion at A, or trying to cut white with B sems more interesting]
;W[qe]C[[Agi\] White fixes the ko, and threatens black's single eye]
;B[pe]C[[Agi\] White wound up fixing the ko in sente. It would have been better for black to go out intot he center than to take gote.]
;W[ng]
(;B[jp];W[jq];B[ip];W[hr];B[hn];W[kp];B[jn]C[[Agi\] White never had much expectation of big territory on the bottom with black peeking in on2 sides. Black also has no real prospects of territory in the center, so this reduction isn't doing much work]
;W[qq];B[pp];W[pr];B[or];W[ro];B[rp];W[rn];B[lb]C[[Agi\] black missing a move in the corner]
;W[rq]C[[Agi\] Which white exploits immediately];B[qp];W[sp]
;B[qr];W[rr];B[qs]C[[Agi\] Normally we would just capture the white stone, later in endgame, S1 becomes a nice sente point for black]
;W[rs];B[ps];W[fn]C[[Agi\] Here white gets to link up her loose center stones together and attack black at the same time]
;B[fr];W[er];B[es];W[km]C[[Agi\] getting boxed in like this is painful for black]
;B[kn];W[ln];B[il];W[lm];B[jm];W[jk];B[hq];W[gr];B[gq];W[fq]
;B[fs]LB[dj:B][jn:C][ep:A][kq:D]C[[Agi\] Black has managed to separate white in gote.. but C looks weaker than the A+B and D groups.]
;W[fl];B[en]C[[Agi\] pushing from the outside seems dubious unless the cut actually works. Otherwise, spending a move to help the weak center group is probably a better idea.]
;W[em];B[fo];W[eo];B[dn];W[iq];B[hp];W[go];B[gn];W[fm];B[ho]
;W[fp];B[dp];W[fo];B[ko];W[lo]LB[fb:C][ok:B][lp:A]C[[Agi\] One has to wonder if the cut at A would make white struggle a bit for life. Otherwise, B and C are white's main sources of big territory.]
;B[he];W[hd];B[kc];W[kb];B[lc];W[jd];B[jb];W[ib];B[ja];W[om]
;B[ld]TR[mg][kh][lh][ki]C[[Agi\] This move is small. The black group is alive already, and these 6 points isn't that important compared to the large white territory developing to the right]
;W[mf]C[[Agi\] With this peep, white solidifies more];B[me]
;W[kg]C[[Agi\] Black played fairly conservatively, and there were some instsances where white got away with sente as a result. Add that to a few positions where black was forced to live small and white pulled steadily ahead.

White didn't go out of their way to make complicated situations, but was quick to take advantage of weaknesses black showed.]
)
(;B[iq]LB[kp:C][fr:A][kr:B]C[[Agi\] The invasion might work. There's some aji available at A/B/C. The most important thing is that if this succeeds even partially, white would be without a base]

(;W[ip];B[jq];W[jp];B[kr])
(;W[jp]
(;B[ip]C[[Agi\] This more coventional way doesn't seem to work very well for black]
;W[io];B[ho];W[hp];B[jo];W[in];B[jq];W[kp];B[kr];W[lr];B[jr]
;W[lq];B[gr];W[fr];B[gq];W[fq]C[[Agi\] This would be dead];B[is]
;W[ks];B[hq])
(;B[hp]C[[Agi\] It might take an odd-looking move like this]
;W[ho];B[gq]
(;W[fq])
(;W[ip];B[hq]LB[fp:A][fr:B]
(;W[go];B[fr])
(;W[fr];B[fq];W[er];B[fp]))))))
(;B[rf];W[sf];B[qe]LB[rd:B][rh:A]C[[Agi\] This leads to an interesting ko for black at A or B]
))
(;B[nh]C[[Agi\] This would be overplay];W[og];B[ng];W[of];B[nf]
;W[oe];B[od])
(;B[ng]C[[Agi\] Maybe run into the center for life, looking for an opportunity to weaken and attack the right side]
;W[ni];B[lf])
(;B[qe];W[rf];B[rg]C[[Agi\] separating white's group also has value. White can't focus entirely on killing your stones if her group is still unsettled]
))
(;B[ce]C[[Agi\] This might be possible, but probably too painful to black in the end.]
;W[cg];B[ee];W[fd]C[[Agi\] White probably stands to profit heavily on both sides]
)
(;B[de]C[[Agi\] This is probably your other choice for coming in]
;W[ee];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[ef];B[cf]TR[he]C[[Agi\] It cedes a large top to white in exchange for the corner, but there's still a small chance at reducing the top in the future]
