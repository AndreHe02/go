C[Hi, i played this game with a friend. i'm a beginner  and i want to
learn my faults. So thank you very  much to reviewer.   I played as a black
and white win with a big  victory...];B[cp];W[pd];B[eq];W[cj]
;B[qp];W[jq];B[oq]C[Is this move too close?

Too close to what? If you talk about the corner, it's a good move. Take the
corner and let white look after his single stone with no base yet. There is
the possibility of playing nearer to the white stone, but hardly to your
advantage.];W[cm];B[cd];W[gq];B[bo]MA[ed][ec][jd][pj][qj]C[Your corner group is not in much danger, so leave this endgame move
for later and take sente (i.e. you can decide where to play instead of
being forced to answer; which is called gote) to get a big point or
influence or both.n
Think about the x-marked points.];W[qj]C[The both stones in the lower left are called a shimari and an
extension before them is considered very valuable. Probably white knew
that...n
This was one of the before mentioned big points.];B[nc];W[lc]
;B[ne];W[pf];B[ng];W[qm]
(;B[mq]C[No!n
This corner group is also save at the moment. The extension is worth about 5
points and doesn't put much pressure on the white stones.

You started an attack at the upper right and that's the place to take
profit. You've cut off a white stone at the upper edge. Now you have 2
options. Catch him or chase him and take the profit elsewhere. The first way
is a bit risky unless you are a bit more experienced (so I will show no
example), the second is the elegant way. See variations.];W[ed]
C[This is the 20th move, what do you think about the  opening?

I think, you played a good fuseki (opening). Although there were better
possible moves, you didn't play wrong moves. Even the commented moves were
ok despite their better alternatives.

I definitely would like to play black at the moment.];B[cg]
;W[cc]C[Now you can see the problem resulting of the slow move 19.n
White uses his single stone as a backguard for his attack against the
corner.]
(;B[de]C[That's the first real mistake.n
Don't be afraid.n
If you decide to play losely, do it to fight back. Otherwise play a solid
shape to defend. See variations.

With this move you invite white to cut your stones and you're forced to
connect them with another one. Why not connecting them with only one move
and get the chance to cut white?];W[dd];B[cf]MA[bd]C[Was it better to play at marked place?

My application seems to cut off your markings, so I can only guess.
Definitely it would've been better to play at x.];W[bd];B[ce]
;W[ic];B[gd];W[ee];B[be];W[bc];B[bi];W[ci];B[ch];W[he];B[ge]
;W[ef];B[bj];W[gf];B[hf];W[ie];B[ff];W[gg];B[fg];W[eg]MA[fe]
C[white should've cut at x.];B[fh];W[hg];B[fe];W[eh];B[ig];W[if]
;B[fb]TR[nc][ne][ng]C[Nice reduction of white's territory, but worthless, if you're
caught. First escape, then reduce.n
And did you realize, that you forced white to build a wall before your
marked stones, slowly creating problems for them?];W[ei];B[fi]
;W[fj];B[gi]MA[ph][pb][en][hi]LB[gj:y]C[What do you think about this move? IS better to  play at marked
places?

It's ok to play here. x and y are slightly better in shape and you can try
them out to understand why. But this move also playable.];W[gj]
;B[hi];W[ih]MA[ij]C[What, if white played at x?

That's, why the other shapes are better.];B[ij];W[ji];B[hj]
LB[qh:y]MA[ni]C[Unnecessary. You are savely connected, so use sente for moves like
x, looking at y.];W[ck];B[bk];W[ob];B[qc];W[qd]TR[nc][ne][ng]
C[Is this a premature attack?

Yes, it is.

Better try to escape with the marked group instead of being shut in and
losing them.];B[rd];W[pc];B[qb];W[re];B[sd];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi]
C[That's what I meant.];B[hm];W[gl];B[im];W[bn];B[dn];W[dm]
;B[cn];W[jo];B[km]C[Is this move enough? Where is the best place for  responding white's
last move?

Depends on your plans. If you want to shut white in and get possibilities to
save the upper right group, it's the best one...];W[lp];B[lq]
MA[no]C[but then you have to play on with that plan at x!];W[ln]
;B[rn];W[lm];B[kl];W[ll];B[li];W[jj];B[ik];W[kk]TR[nc][ne][ng]
[nh][li]C[Now, by losing the marked group, you're behind.n
It's a consequence of your attack in the upper right corner combined with
your letting his lower edge group escape.];B[jk];W[lk];B[kj]

;W[jb];B[ia];W[fp];B[ep];W[kr];B[lr];W[oo];B[pp];C[Now this is a territory for white? How could i play  for not to give
this area to white?

At this stage of the game you couldn't avoid it. It was white territory as
soon as you lost the  upper right group.];W[kq];B[lf];W[fq]
;B[og];W[pg];B[of];W[br]C[Unnecessary. White is highly in the lead.n
Is cosidered as unpolitely by some.];B[an];W[bm];B[ao];W[np]

To that question I can't give any satisfying answer. n
Simply rely on your experience growing and after a while you will get the
feeling, that the ko-moves find you.];W[as];B[ds];W[am];B[ar]

For sure there is one.n
What if white a, black b, white c?n
Yes, the already dead group is absolutely dead.

But play at c and your once dead group faces the miracle of resurrection.]

Yes];W[el];B[dj];W[di];B[fm]C[Last 5 moves :)];W[id];B[hh];B[jg]
;C[This is the end o f the game, and white wins with a  big victory...

Nice game, it was not lost by big fighting mistakes, more the by problem of
keeping the stones connected and make them work together. Try to get an eye
for the strength and weakness of groups and how to use them to put pressure
onto your opponent.n
For example, don't use a wall to make territory. Push your opponent against
it and make territory on the other side.

A last suggestion:n
If you realize, that the match is  definitely lost, it's more interesting to
start a new game than fighting for a 60 point loss. It's considered polite
to resign at the right moment. In this game I think it was about move 142.

But don't hesitate, you're on the right way. I hope, I could help you a bit.n
If there are any questions, don't be afraid to ask.n
I'm still interested in your further matches.

Bye,
