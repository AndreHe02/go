C[Hi, I'm adum, your friendly reviewer. (adum@aya.yale.edu -- feel free to
email any questions.)

First, I'd put your rank at about 7 or 8 kyu AGA, and maybe 12 - 14 kyu on
IGS. If you really want to measure your rating, and also improve, I'd
recommend playing on IGS (Internet Go Server.) Ranks there are pretty
accurate. It's also free.

your opening in general seemed pretty good. You missed several tactical
opportunities, and that's probably the most restricting factor in your
game right now.

The single biggest problem you have is making wasted moves. I think three
times you played moves that had zero or close to zero effect.   good luck!

it];B[jc]C[more urgent to extend around n4, or maybe p5. a white play at n3 now
would make you uncomfortable];W[hc];B[df];W[qf]
(;B[pf]C[not a good attack:
1) try to attack stones from a distance: i.e., don't make contact plays on
weak stones you're attacking
2) it pushes him onto the already weak R10 stone -- you should play away
from strength

scared. he should ignore them and either live underneath or run out.]
