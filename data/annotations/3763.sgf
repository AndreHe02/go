C[ggg [14k?\]: hi
dbHaze [15k\]: Hi.  Have a good game.


*Haze* Hmm.  I thought I was going to win this one.  Ended up losing by 44 or so points.  It's a game of 0.5 komi.
--
S> Hello there. Scartol here, AKA Eric Piotrowski. Your main problem here seems to be lack of focus, and making unnecessary moves. Hopefully I can provide some assistance. (As you see, my comments all start with the S> symbol)]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[od]LB[pe:B][pf:A]C[*Haze* I wasn't sure how to respond to this... or if I should respond at all.  I considered playing a different move, but played Q14 to attempt to keep my moyo.
--
S> Well, as Hikaru no Go makes clear, this is usually handled with a move at A, where you went. Once upon a time, B was the move, since it's a bit safer. But with the advent of komi, A has become more common.]
;B[pf]C[S> This is fine. Keep in mind that you're playing for security right now. Your opponent is being more aggressive -- neither of which is inherently better than the other. The thing to remember is that you will need later to spread out more; and white will need to go back and cover her bases.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[S> I don't understand the purpose of this move. Surely you know that this will be captured; and what can be the point of sacrificing a stone so early?]
;W[pd]
(;B[rc];W[qb]
(;B[qe]C[S> Black does end up with a nice safe mini-wall, but if white is smart, she gets sente.]
;W[rb]LB[rd:A][re:B]C[S> But she plays here instead. Black should ignore this move and play a bigger move elsewhere. If white A, then black B and white is forced to capture in gote. It's just one stone, and there are obviously more urgent moves to be made elsewhere.
--
Personally, I would head into white's moyo as soon as possible. The more she's able to solidify her widespread moyo, the harder it will be to reduce or invade it.]
;B[sc];W[ld];B[fq];W[hp]
(;B[dq]LB[fo:B][cq:A]C[*Haze* I read in a book that such an attack on the corner is pretty good (playing a diagonal (F3) and then a one point jump under the defender's stone (D3)) but I have not once gotten it to work as planned.  Perhaps my second stone should have been played at C3?  I think I could take the corner with that, and the F3 might come into use.
--
S> The F3 move is standard, but when white plays the pincer, a move like -- as you mention -- A is usual; from a whole-board perspective, jumping out to B is probably better. (One advantage white has in this game is the ability to cut black apart from himself.) See the variations one move back.]
;W[cq];B[cp]LB[dr:A]C[S> This is a bit odd. A is more common, if small.]
;W[do];B[cr];W[bq]
(;B[br];W[bp];B[eq]C[S> Not a bad result overall, but white has all her stones working together. This, you don't want.]
;W[dn]C[S> This is totally unnecessary for white. Pounce on the advantage!]
;B[jp]LB[fc:A][cf:B]C[S> This move suggests you're paranoid about the bottom. Let that take care of itself for now. Invading the top or left side is imperative! (Either A or B is a good place to start.)]
;W[lp];B[hq]LB[jn:A]C[S> This sort of move is useful only when linking up is key. Think whole-board; jump out to A and let white worry about the M4 stone.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[gq];B[hr];W[gp];B[gr];W[pm]LB[nq:A]C[*Haze* I am completely unsure of how I should handle this stone...
--
S> I would respond calmly at A. White will seal black into the corner, but that's not really a big deal. (If black wanted to stay connected to the center, he needed to work on that earlier)]
;B[ql];W[qm];B[pl];W[om];B[nq]C[S> This is a bit late (though, obviously, black lived). Notice that white has a nice big wall looming over this black corner.]
;W[qp]C[S> And she uses it well.];B[qq]C[*Haze* Could this have been played better?]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[po];B[op];W[mn]C[S> Why is it good for white to split black apart? Because the more time you have to spend making eyes is less time you have to attack white.]

(;B[di]C[In a situation like this, I'd say a 3rd line invasion is better. This sort of 4th line invasion is best when you have lots of outside influence to which you can easily run. See the variation for a better way to start.]
;W[ck];B[ce]LB[cf:A]C[S> Too close. Don't forget that a diagonal move like this is a form of contact play -- and you want to avoid those when trying to weaken your enemy. A will suffice.]
;W[cd];B[be];W[de];B[df];W[ef];B[eg]LB[dg:A]C[S> Too far. Just be safe and extend to A.]
;W[fg];B[eh];W[cf]C[*Haze* Thought, for some reason, that I could live from a C14 attack, but I was wrong.
--
S> Yes.];B[dg];W[bf];B[fh];W[ff];B[dk];W[dl];B[cj];W[ek];B[ej]
;W[cl];B[bg];W[bd];B[cg];W[ae];B[bj];W[bk];B[fk];W[id]C[*Haze* I'm looking pretty bad here...
--
S> Yes, this is probably the death move for black. Was the E9 stone really so important to go after?]
;B[el];W[em];B[fm]LB[jc:A]C[S> You're clearly not going to be able to kill this white group, so you're better off trying to reduce white's top. (You might even be able to pull off an invasion if you start at A and use the aji of black's Q17 stone.)]
;W[fn];B[gm];W[ph]LB[nc:C][nf:A][nh:B]C[*Haze* Again, another invasion I have no idea how to handle.
--
S> I would jump to A. When white jumps to B, use the opportunity to attack the top with C or something like it.]
;B[pi];W[oh];B[qh];W[of];B[qf]C[S> This move does nothing. You might as well pass. (I don't mean to be harsh, but it really is that useless.)]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[oe];B[gn];W[fo];B[jf]C[*Haze* Guess this should have been K12?
--
S> If you're trying to make significant territory in the middle, there's really no point -- white has too many ways to reduce it down to nothing. You need to get up into that top territory.]
;W[jh];B[ih];W[ig];B[hh];W[hg]LB[jg:A]C[S> Play A next. It offers some possibilities.. (See variation)]

(;B[ji];W[kh];B[ki];W[lh];B[li]C[*Haze* I was hesitant to play this stone.  Shouldn't have.]

;W[nl];B[lj]C[*Haze* worried about K8
--
S> A minor concern, to say the least. White is ahead by many, many points. Without an invasion up top, there's no way black can win it. There's not much more to say after this point, so I'll end my comments here. 
--
You've got some skills when it comes to living and defending what's yours; now it's time to work on invading and striking when your enemy is weak.
