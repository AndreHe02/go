C[Hello, dear reviewer! Thank You in advance for spending Your time to do the review!
In this game I played black and lost it by 3,5pts. There were two endgame mistakes. Also there were some problems with attacking white's weak groups. I've added some questions, but any other comments and suggestions about my mistakes are appreciated! Especially I would be gratefull if You show some better ways to attack!
Thanks again for help!
Good luck!

(Yan)  Hi I'm Yan.  I'm currently about 1d on KGS.  I will do my best to review your game.  But I would recommend the book "lessons in the fundamentals of Go"  to anyone before 1d.  You would gain so much more than from my review:-).]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]C[(FR) Is f3 ok for kakari or was C15/D15 better?

(Yan) There is no better or worse at this point.  It's personal preference.]
;B[fq];W[fo];B[hp]C[(FR) Wasn't J3 better?

(Yan) H4 is good.  F5 is an influence move, so your H4 is good for counter influence(and works well with your Q3 stone).  You can also consider C3 and settle for territory.  That's one of the more common josekis.]
;W[dj];B[kc];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[np]C[(Yan) O4 is a bit too greedy.  White can m3 and p3 later on and destory all the territory you have at the bottom.  O3 leaves no aji and therefore is a more solid move.]

(;W[qi];B[qg]C[(FR) Preparing to invade R9.

(Yan) Good!  You also expand your moyo on top.  Two birds in one stone, very efficient.]
;W[dq]C[(Yan) Big but not urgent move for white.  P11 is better.]
;B[on]C[(Yan) Hmmm. The aji at R8 is gone after you played this move.]
;W[pn];B[qk];W[pk];B[qj];W[pj];B[ri];W[ph]C[(Yan) Q12 is really bad.  Simply Q11 is much better.  Q12 is gote move.]
;B[qh];W[pi];B[ql]C[(FR) Now I'm not sure about R8. Wasn't it aji-keshi? Was tennuki better?]
;W[om];B[pg];W[kp]C[(FR) In the game I played K5. Was this proper way to deal with L4?

(Yan) Since you are pretty weak here.  You want to make yourselve stronger.  This is the time to play some contact move, for example K4, or even D2 and see how while responds.  To give you an idea, I will play D2 and it will result in some sort of exchange.]

(;B[jo];W[ko]
(;B[jn]C[(Yan) I would L6 instead.  Force white to your strong right corner.]
;W[kn]C[(Yan) K3 for b would be a good forcing move.  Hard for white to ignore...]
;B[jl];W[iq]LB[ho:B][ip:A]C[(Yan) Bad shape so you are going to get very heavy.  I would consider H3.]

(;B[ip];W[hq];B[lq];W[kq];B[km];W[nn];B[no]C[(Yan) not sure what you are trying to do here.  You want to stay away from White's strong group for now.]
;W[mn];B[nm];W[oo]C[(FR) I think, that saving F3 is small. Am I right?]
;B[jj];W[gp];B[gc]C[(Yan) I would consider D15 or C15.  It's not a good idea to exchange big moyo with big territory.  Big frameworks are very heavy and white can treat invasion lightly after he's got enough territory.]
;W[ce]C[(Yan) white is very solid on the left now.];B[ng];W[oc]

(;B[mc]C[(Yan) Should be Q17.  You are too strong here to let white live so easily.  :-)]

;W[na];B[od];W[nd];B[oe];W[ne];B[nc];W[of];B[pe];W[nf];B[og]
;W[lf]LB[je:A][le:B]
(;B[je]C[(FR) Were there more aggressive ways to attack O15 group? Are variations, starting from M15 better?

(Yan) In this case you want to attack slowly.  You will gain the most by attacking slowly.  The purpose is never to kill.  The purpose it to win.  I think M12 is good and then somewhere around E15.  You want to build up your strength and then attack.  White cannot run that fast.  His group is really weak.]
;W[jf];B[ie];W[ig]C[(FR) Here, I'm not sure about proper direction of attack. In the game I thought about moves around F13, but was afraid of  the weakening of my own K6 group.
Now I think, it was even better to invade the left side. What do You think about it? Is starting around C7 ok?

(Yan) Again you won't be able to gain much by attacking so fast.]

Thanks again for the review! Any general comments about my game and ways to improve?

(Yan) I think your fighting skills is pretty good, which means your reading level is already pretty good.  I would recommend the fundamentals go book because there are times where you can gain a lot if you follow the advice on the fundamentals.

It was a good game and I enjoyed reviewing it.  Thank you and have fun playing go, unless you want to be a professional player:-).]
