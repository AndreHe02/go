C[gerger: Hello reviewer, thanks in advance for your advice !
I won this game but only because of a few careless moves by my opponent in the endgame. Im very interested to know how it came to be that I got so behind. 

gerger: I have made a few comments, generally not as questions but more like statements and what I was thinking - please correct me when im wrong.

DM: Hello,
I enjoyed reviewing the game, Is wa interesting and large scale in the opening. I think Black Has to learn to rely more on his own positions and evaluate the soce correctly. At various points in the game Black assumed he was behind while he was not. Further I sugest studing 'shape' And try to play solid moves.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[cp];W[cd];B[eq];W[ic];B[cj]C[DM: This is a big ponit to play,
It is the main extension from balck's shimari in the low left
It is verry common for white to pla around this point instead of J 17]
;W[pj];B[qm];W[kq];B[iq];W[nq];B[pq];W[no]C[gerger: felt n2 was a bit premature since he could so easily run with the help of O5 

gerger: maybe its just me but I felt the fuseki was favouring white and that I was overconcentrated. White had spread his stones much better.

DM: At this point the situation is about equal, Black has more terretory and no weak groups so one may say black is a little better even. There is no evidence to sugest that white has a real advantage at this point in the game]

(;B[qc]C[gerger: wanted to do something with his double wing formation in that corner and felt that kakaris would give me a weak group so I invaded at 3-3 to get sure life, well aware he would get a strong wall facing q10 or J17

gerger: maybe that wall was too good for white and C13 or a kakari at R14 or so would be better ?]

(;B[rf];W[qg];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[nc]C[gerger: now I felt really behind and was determined to reduce his framework

Again there is no reason for cocern at this point. White had a lot of influence so time to reduce, good strategy]
;B[ie];W[ed]C[Since white doesnt realy awnser J15 it is possible to play tenuki here and see J15 as a forcing play.]

;B[ko];W[hn]LB[nk:B][ol:A]C[gerger: was really glad he did H6 so I could get this point which I felt was huge, maybe I took it too late

Localy you ar right that reducing there is quitre large, however this move doesnt realy word together with the stones already on the bord

Still C11 is the point on the bord. appart from that somethin like A or B may be good]

You should not feer real bad, maybe cou could have played is better but those stones make 15 pints difference on the left side. I think it is a sufficient result for black.]
