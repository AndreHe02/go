;B[pd];W[dd];B[qj]C[usual player play higher version (Q10), but this move is also possible.]
;W[nq];B[qn]LB[lq:a][kp:b][pn:c]C[Go principle. "Avoid redundancy and Seek efficiency". black stones already occupied on 3rd line, and another stone on 3rd line added. a bit redundancy. from that perspective, this move is not good. better are pincer (eg.M3, L4) or higher version extension (Q6)]
;W[pr];B[qq]C[too solid move. i'd like to skip here.];W[jp]LB[kq:a][lq:b]
C[overplay by w. correct was L3(A). blck should seek M3(B) invasion (later or now)]
;B[fc];W[ec]C[bad strategy. solidifing black and have 3-3 invasion.];B[fd]
;W[df];B[jc]C[black's moyo became nice. that was fault of E17. white's best move was 3-3invasion, i think.(maybe my taste) see var.]

(;W[pf]C[joseki(standard corner variation) is O16, but R14 seems work best. i am not sure about this.]
;B[qf]C[let's see standard(correct) variation.]

;W[rh]C[empty triangle. bad. white should skip here, or (better is) capture one stone by Q13, to prevent future aji(bad taste).]
;B[cn]LB[fp:a]TR[pg]C[capure R15 stone. even if you didn't see it, play F4 or near, threatening Q13 stone's move.]
;W[co]C[also bad move.];B[bo]LB[ck:a][cj:b]C[just extend. (D6). you should know....(white) this kind of move(C5) is used only when attacking. when white have another stone around C9, and black cannot extend to side(in korean, beol-lim). at first glance, white occupied corne. but when black invade to 3-3(C3), white cannot capture it. so, (black) should seek this aji(future utilization). B5 is bad because it removed 3-3 aji and achied nothing.]
;W[cp]C[empty triangle.bad shape. block with B4. b5-c4 exchange was awkward.]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[cj];W[rd];B[sh];W[ri]C[this exchang was good for white. black is weakening lower right side & made his sacrifice bigger. even if you could capture R15 stone, this exchange was not good. think before put a stone. bear it in mind. Even if it is sente(in korean, seon-su), Think before whether it is good or bad for you. Dont' make a meaningless exchange.]

(;B[pc]C[passive.];W[sc];B[md]LB[lq:a]C[from here, (black) should seek M3 invasion, and white sould prevent it.]
;W[bp]C[well, from here, for black, 1)M3 invasion or other invasion oriented move or 2) hane at E14 was better move, another move all bad. for white, similar.]
;B[bn]C[this exchange was only endgame move. both players should skip.]
;W[mf];B[ff]C[direction was good, but just hane.];W[bg];B[bh];W[bf];B[ch]
C[skip, or if you insist answering, answer by B11!
 .(advantageous for territory)];W[pj];B[qk];W[qr];B[rr];W[no]C[at last white protected.]
;B[om];W[fn];B[eo]C[if you didn't see utilization method, leave it alone. this kind of move just help white (solidifying).]
;W[fo];B[eq]C[helping white.];W[ep]C[game became somewhat irreversible. overally, black played  somewhat passively. go(baduk) is efficiency-race, and please seek efficiency. and take some fighting spirit. (comment ended).]
