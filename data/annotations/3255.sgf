C[Hello, I played white in this game. This is the game which I think I played end game quite well and won by a small margin. Which means I might be losing in the middle game.

Please give some pointers on direction of play. Thank you in advance.]

;B[jq];W[jc]C[Good.  The black stone at K3 is low, so the bottom side isn't interesting.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[fo]
(;W[dl]C[This move isn't urgent.  Since the stone at C6 is low, the left side isn't an interesting place to play, that is, neither player can make a big territory there.  It would be better to develop the top at F17 or O17.]
;B[gc]C[Now black gets to develope the top.  The D8 move didn't make much additional territory, while G17 attacks the K17 stone, so black is going to develop faster than white now.]
;W[nc];B[pc]C[This is probably a mistake. What if white plays R14?]

(;W[nf]C[These stones are already strong, so there is no need to run out into the center yet.  It would be better to make your left center moyo bigger.]
;B[oe];W[qk]C[Again, this is not really needed.  neither side can make a big territory on thr right side.  It would be better to expand the center.]
;B[om]
(;W[im]C[Should be H6?

Yes, H6 is probably better.  It pushes black down lower and expands the center moyo.]
;B[hn];W[hm];B[gf]C[Better at G13?]
(;W[in]LB[gg:B][in:A];B[gh];W[ip];B[iq];W[hp];B[hq];W[lo];B[kp]
;W[ko];B[fg];W[of];B[pf];W[on]C[This one was probably a mistake. Maybe N8?

No, I like cutting off the P7 stone.  White should be able to make profit around either L7 or P10, depending on where black runs.]

C[I didn't think this group was alive...

It looks hard to kill to me.  Black already has on eye at P8.]
;B[gk];W[nj];B[ni]C[Now I realized my mistake!];W[mi];B[mj]
;W[nh];B[oj]
(;W[cp]C[The rest was end game. I was probably still trialing at this point. Better start another fight? (H10 maybe?)

Lets count.  Black has maybe 20 in the upper left, 20 in the upper right, and at most 30 on the bottom, and maybe 5 in the center, for a total of 75.  White has about 20 in the lower right, maybe 10 in the upper center, maybe 25 on the left and about 10 in the center, for a total of 65 plus komi, so white is a little behind. The last move at C4 isn't forcing, so black is probably ahead by about 10-15.  White should probably try to find something bigger than C4.  What about P18.  If black doesn't respond, the corner might get in trouble.]
;B[ne];W[me]C[Whit should ignore this and take a big point somewhere.

P 18 is still big, as are B15, B4, S12 and P2.];B[oh];W[mf]
;B[ng];W[ob]C[Good!];B[pb];W[hb]C[Maybe B15 is bigger?  When black responds at G18, white will need anothe move to make profit at J2.]
;B[gb];W[eg]C[This isn't so big.  The big points now, are B15, B4, P2 J18, and S12.  White wants to get at least 3 of them, and more if possible.]
;B[eh];W[dh];B[ei];W[be]C[White gets one big point.];B[di];W[ch]

;B[go];W[jo];B[nr]C[black gets the final big point, but white got 3 out of 5.

I general, I think white got a little behind in the opening because of the slow move at  C8 instead of developing the top.    It is almost always better to make your weak stones stronger than to just take territory.]

(;W[hg];B[je]C[Now the white group at the top is starting to get enclosed, so maybe it is time to make it a little stronger.]
;W[lb]C[Usually it is best to run out into the center to protect a group, but in this case, black could chase you and reduce the moyo, so living in place looks better to me.]
;B[hn];W[hl];B[jn]C[This looks like a good time to count.  Black has about 15 in the upper right, 20 in the upper left, and maybe 35 on the bottom, for a total of 70.  White has about 15 in the lower right, maybe 5 on the top, and maybe 40 on the left, for a total of 60 plus komi so white is behind by about 5, but has the move, so a 10 point move would make the game about even.]
