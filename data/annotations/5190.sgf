C[Hi,

I played this game in an online tourney. I made a few mistakes early, though I thought I recovered decently from them. I ended up losing by almost thirty points though. Since I put so much effort into the game and still lost by so much, I thought it would be a good game to send in for comments.

I Played black in this game.

Thank you for you time in reviewing this game.

pajaro: Hi. I'm going to review your game. I'll try to point out the most important mistakes. I hope you can learn something from my review. I'll start my comments with pajaro:

Enjoy.];B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[jd];B[de];W[cg]C[I wasn't sure what to do here, so I thought I could try to cut all three white stones and figure out a good result from that.

pajaro: What is going to happen is still uncertain. But you must have realistic goals. Black is outnumbered here, so you can't just "try to cut all three w stones". This is not reasonable. Rather, w is the attacking side, so b should play with this is mind.]

(;B[fd]C[pajaro: This is a possible move according to the books, but frankly, I've never played it. E15 or C17 are more usual to me. See vars.]
;W[fc];B[gd]C[pajaro: This pushing is not good. b is ahead in the race, but w crawls on the 3rd line, and K16 is there and will help him  a lot.]
;W[gc];B[dg]C[pajaro: not good.
1- w has a hane at the head of 2 stones at H16. This, with the weak point at E16, makes b vulnerable.
2- b was leaning against the top, so it looks like b's plan is to gain strength. So, to attack C13, you must pincer it. If you attach against a stone, you make it stronger. But this is the stone you wanted to attack! So don't touch it.]
;W[ce];B[cd]C[pajaro: b has lots of cutting points];W[df];B[ef]
;W[cf];B[dd];W[dh];B[db]C[pajaro: Not a bad idea...];W[cc];B[ec]
;W[eb];B[ed];W[fb]
(;B[cb]C[pajaro: but this is wrong. b can't capture. See previous var.]
;W[bc]
(;B[bd]C[This was a mistake, I thougth afterwards I saw a good continuation..]
;W[bb];B[hc];W[hd];B[he]C[pajaro: If you plan to do this, don't play H17!]
;W[id];B[jp];W[cn];B[mc];W[eg]C[pajaro: Although this looks like a slow move, it's not bad. W removes aji, the left looks whiter and b still has to make life.]
;B[ff];W[qg]C[pajaro: This is too early. The right side is b's area of influence. A better plan would be to attack G16 and gain strength. Then the invasion would be easier.]

(;B[qd]C[pajaro: This shows that b is concerned only about territory. Wrong. You must attack and then make territory, but not just make territory and hope to be faster than the opponent. What I'm trying to say is: play R15. See var.]
;W[pi];B[ok];W[mh];B[hg];W[hp];B[kb]C[I wasn't sure how to deal with the white stones on the right. I suppose something around m15 would've been better?

pajaro: First: L18 is yose. It should be left for later. A move is yose if doesn't attack or defend, and is only about points. It may look big, but now you must look for moves that make points _while attacking_
About the left w stones: m15 might be better, cutting the connection to K16. Even if b gets stregth around there, H17 has aji and the perhaps L18 would have more value, because it would become an attack.]
;W[jg]C[pajaro: w tenuki against L18 and connects all his stones while attacking b. That's the proper approach.]
;B[mf];W[mj];B[jf]
(;W[jb]C[pajaro: Before defending, w should try to connect.]
;B[hj];W[mp]C[pajaro: chaos now... None of the players are making long attacks, missing chances.]
;B[ml]C[pajaro: Good, splitting both sides.];W[ig];B[hh];W[kf]
;B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[oi];B[li];W[oj];B[pk];W[nf];B[mg];W[nh]
;B[lh];W[lg];B[me];W[ng]
(;B[pf]C[Here's another mistake, I should've played at k11 instead of trying to removes white's base too early.

pajaro: Capturing M12 is not so easy. But as long as w has an escape, you wont' be able to capture.]
;W[kj];B[jh];W[ji]C[pajaro: This doesn't capture M12.]
(;B[jn]C[pajaro: tenuki again... See var.];W[ii]C[arcin [11k\]: .]
;B[gj];W[pp];B[oq];W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[qo];W[rr]
(;B[qr]C[pajaro: This helps w, because w will end sente.];W[rq]
;B[pr];W[op];B[mr];W[ro];B[qn];W[rs];B[lq]C[I thought this went well, but I wonder if it was possible for me to kill everything in there?

pajaro: I don't think that it is possible to kill everything. There are lots of ways of maneuvering.]
;W[ek]C[I think I could've done a better job invading/reducing here, but I didn't know where to start.

pajaro: That's because b lost a lot of time in non urgent moves.]
;B[dp];W[eq];B[co];W[bp];B[dn];W[bo];B[cm];W[bn];B[fm]C[pajaro: Playing lightly is a good idea.]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[em]
(;B[en]C[pajaro: Bad. A big lost chance. b is playing like this to save D6 etc, but this is forcing w to make all the left his territory.

See var.

The rest is yose. No more comments. But a few general advices:
1- Read a bit.
2- Consider what's strong and what's weak.
3- Read a bit more.
4- Be realistic.
5- Read again (what else?)];W[el];B[gn];W[fo];B[fn];W[ih];B[ej]
