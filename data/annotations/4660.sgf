;B[pd]C[I was black.  Just looking for some general comments.  Ok I know the administrators prefer specific questions, but I don't really know...I indicated some specific stuff - but just generally I didn't (and still don't) really know how to play better...

Any general insights you might have on improving my game would be appreciated :-)

I'm about 17kyu now, the opponent thought he was 12-16 kyu....not really sure how true that can be, but still there were quite a few tough fights which there isn't usually against 18kyu or weaker opponents...  *shrug*  :-D]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]C[everybody has his own style. for example i try to avoid big moyos and i dont have much experience with those]
;W[qo]
(;B[qm]C[this somehow seems strange, too heavy. you have other options still available, i added some variations which i would have played]
;W[oo];B[np];W[mq]C[a more secure way would be to connect at p3

now white has 2 weak groups and he also cant seal you in]
(;B[mp];W[lq];B[pp]C[the black stones arent connected and white can cut. you were lucky that white cut right away, but the variation shows you how it would have looked like

so connecting at p3 would still be good]
(;W[op];B[po];W[oq];B[on];W[no]C[black is ahead and has sente, play a bigger point (for example attack a corner)

so one general tip here:

think like this - stones are just points, so if some of them get separated then think if you still need them for something. if not then dont escape with them. doesnt matter if your opponent catches them, then you get the chance to play the bigger points, and you can probably use your stones later]

(;B[mo];W[nn];B[om];W[ln]C[not very big but still worth mentioning here, you can leave out the o3 and o2 moves...better that way]

(;W[io]C[this was a small move];B[fd]C[Approaching from the wrong side - but I think this is a standard play against chinese fuseki type positions.  And ok he didn't have a chinese fuseki but as you'll see the resulting position looks quite good for black.  White still managed to live on the right hand side a bit though.

I dont know if it is standard, havent seen this in my games.]
;W[de];B[id]C[and i would attack from the other side (O16 or O17) this way white can make use of the n9 stones]

So to know if it is safe try reading it if white plays there, and already you can see that if black plays r8 then both white stones are capturted and black lives, so basically you had to read and imagine only 2 stones here.]

yes, sometimes capturing his stones shows him that its time to quit trying =), but only do that if you know that you are leading, and remember...corners are big, pay attention to them]
