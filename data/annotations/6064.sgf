C[rafusmx: Hi!
I think that this game is the best I had played in a lot of time. I used to play a few years ago. Now, when I'm trying to get back I feel kind of lost.

I think this is the best game I had in the last four months, but still have this feeling that I'm playing his game, and I couldn't find where it goes wrong.\
Merridock Hi, i'll be reviewing the game. I'll answer yourquestions, and offer my suggestions.]
;B[dp];W[pc]LB[cp:A][dq:B]C[N0edge: hi


 Your opening move was solid, but I'm going to let you in on something: most invasions occur at 3-3 points ( C-3; R-3; R-17; and c-17). Keep that in mind when making your cornr moves. Your move plays for territory, his plays for security
Consider A and B for good beginning moves that offer security.]

C[Here, I was trying to make a polite opening.


Merridock: Don't worry about polite openings. You were being to cautious. Look closely. On his last move you should have seen this. Wite is represented by triangles, and you will be circles. 
    I'm sure you can see that he is blocking you in. As an alternative, your move this round should have been more agressive. perhaps near A ( see the branch).]

(;W[nq];B[qq];W[pq]C[Merridock: Here you see why playing on the third line was safer for him. I allowed him to surround you easier.]

;B[jl]LB[jm:A][km:1]SQ[kl]C[I can tell you what went wrong. It was right here. By following him down, you let him make his wall. Instead, you should have played at A. You will be represented by letters, and he will be numbers. Refer the move tree.]

Thats because he already has his wall. Realy, wour game crumbled the momentg you started chasing him. A basic rule of thumb is to constantly try to visualize any kind of wall your opponent could make, and think of ways to block it while staying safe.]
