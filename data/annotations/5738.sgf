C[A: Hello, welcome to the Go teaching ladder. Im Andreas and I am about 1 Dan in Europe. This review was made with cgoban3, and my comments are marked with an A:

First a few tips on preparing a game to review:

Write a short introduction at the beginning of the game, at least write what color you played (from Your comments I assume You played white) and what Your main problems were. This makes reviewing easier and helps other GTL users to see what the review might be about. 

Then, write Your comment on moves You think were crucial for Your game, and any questions You have about certain moves. . 

About the game in general:

The chosen game was a good choice to be reviewed, a lost game but close and no real blunders. I think You played better shape than Your opponent and went ahead during a big part of the game, but You seemed to underestimate the value of moving out into the center sometimes (especially at move 24 and 42, see review). This ended up in you having many small groups, and there is a proverb that the player with fewer groups wins the game. 

You should also think about your choice of connecting moves, if you make a hanging connection You should consider if your opponent could take advantage of ataris or peeping moves and if a solid connection could be better. This of course does not mean that you should not play hanging connections at all.]

C[A: everythink looks ok so far];B[ci]C[A: this was a bad move by the opponent, and You handled it well.]
;W[cj];B[dj];W[ck]
(;B[dh];W[ei];B[bi];W[eh];B[dg];W[ek]LB[do:A]C[A: a good result for white, whites group got strong, blacks territory is small and the stone at A would now be better on the 3rd line]
;B[fc];W[fd]C[A: the right idea, attach to strengthen Yourself.]
;B[gd]
(;W[ec]LB[fe:A]C[A: being sealed into the corner in gote is not a good result for white, its more interesting for white to play at A to get into the center.]
;B[fe];W[ed];B[gc];W[be];B[eg]
(;W[pj]LB[mc:B][ge:A]C[I feel a bit confuse about my move here, should i go for the right side or the top?

A: playing at the top would reduce blacks influence and aim at the cut at A. But the right side is also ok. I would prefer a low move, though, because I would like to invade the lower right corner later.]
;B[nc];W[ld]C[A: this is an overplay, if black just jumps out white has a problem]
;B[lc]C[A:black seems to like to attach to pincer stones, but i dont think that is a good idea.]
;W[kc];B[md];W[lb];B[mc]
(;W[jd]LB[kd:A][le:B]C[A: it is better to connect solidly at A, the atari at b is too good for black.]
;B[le];W[kd]LB[jd:B][le:A]C[A: from a tewari point of view, black exchanged A for B.]
;B[pf]
(;W[qf]LB[oe:A]C[A: again, moving out into the center is more interesting.]
;B[qg];W[qe];B[pg];W[pb];B[gg]
(;W[if]LB[jf:A]C[A: why not A? the black left is extremely solid, thus uninteresting, while the right side has more weaknesses and more potential for expanding.]

(;B[pq];W[qp];B[oe];W[kg]LB[kf:A]C[A: strange shape, A would look more natural]
;B[lg];W[kf];B[lh]
(;W[ib]LB[jb:A][ji:B]C[A: a low move without much effect on black. If You play at A instead, the eyehsape is better and You threaten the monkey jump connection. Moving into the center at B looks more active.]
;B[kr];W[jr];B[kq];W[jo];B[gp]C[A: another strange contact play from black.]

(;W[hp]LB[fq:A]C[A: better at A];B[go]
(;W[kp]LB[fq:A]C[A: the move at A is very big];B[fr]

A: my feeling tells me that A wouldnt hurt, white has many places to run and the white groups look pretty stable.]

(;W[hb]C[A: this is a strange move, not gaining much but inducing black to take the big endgame in the corner. Since You lost by 2 points, this is probably the losing move. See variation.
