W+17.5
-------------------------
 I will want to know how can I play a better fuseky, especially when the opponet's moves are in theory bad.
 Also i have some questions about particular moves in the game.

;B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[dd]LB[dc:A]C[A is also a good move as it looks at area now]
;B[jp];W[qn];B[np]C[this is the Josike for the 4x3 point];W[qp]
TR[rp]C[I think S4 better
yes S4 for w then R3 for b.];B[qq]SQ[rp]C[S4 now and you can keep R5 for later   or the josike is Q5
or another Josike is S3]

C[Bad move. R8 connects to the group
yes  give up one stone to get into the center];B[ql]
(;W[rk];B[rl];W[qm];B[rj];W[rm];B[sk]SQ[qk][rk]C[in my last vareation b took 6 moves to capture one stone, now 8 moves to capture 2 stones . in both cases w must look for eyes or get into the center]

(;W[cq]C[After E5 C3 black lives in the corner
E5 C3?? white C3 will live];B[fp];W[dq];B[gp];W[cp]C[good move]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[rr];W[sq];B[sr];W[ro]
(;B[qf]TR[qo]C[After T4 S4 T6 the white group will have only one eye.
yes  so w must run to center for second eye  but it is w move so T6  or T7 makes life
i like T6 better];W[nd];B[ph];W[en];B[gn];W[re];B[rf];W[qe]

;B[cf]LB[ce:A][df:B][ch:C]C[how to respond to this C14  look at all the board you are strong in lower left so you can push him that way with C15  black responds D14 and white C12  black must fight or run to center]
;W[df]C[How I can respond to this invasion ?];B[ce];W[cd];B[de]
;W[ee];B[dg];W[ch];B[cg]
(;W[dh];B[ef]C[This is not bad because black don't have yet a base for his group and the borders of top and right moyos are closed.

But i think is a better way.
 yes saveing the one stone there would make you stronger at the top]
;W[fe];B[eg]TR[fg]SQ[bh]C[To close for black
In this area maybe F13
black can live by getting a second eye in the center  or on the side as he did]

;W[ms];B[jq];W[jr];B[iq];W[nn]C[The situation is bad.   Black was are very great wall on the bottom 4th line.

The exchange is suposed to be optimal only with a 3rd line territory.
 but you have 3 way's into the center  and it is a 10 point game for black at this point so you must reduce blacks points]

;B[mn]C[I decided to lose connection with my side group (presumed alive) and bild some strong group to influence the centre. at this point better to keep every thing connected as it put you 20 points down]
;W[ln];B[mo];W[nj];B[ok];W[lj]C[I think was a good decision.

Black don't have much hope for territory now.]

T13 is ok to take 2 points from b.
