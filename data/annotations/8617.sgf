AB[pd][dp][pp]C[icenine [10k\]: hi
Kurato1 [13k\]: hi, have a good game

Dear reviewer, I am Kurato1!
It was a handicap H3 game and both sides has equal points in the ending. I am interesting in a fuseki mistakes and b weak points in tuban.

I think my moves was too passive. i would like to know how b should play to get more effective result.

mjr: Hi there.  I don't think passive would be correct, I think reactionary is better.  You seem to almost never tenuki first.  But your biggest problem was a weak group that turned into a dragon.  I didn't see any HUGE yose mistakes.  And there isn't much of a fuseki to speak of in handicap go.  Most of your loses came from the dragon and missing the direction of play.  I tried to point these things out as well as possible, but if you have any questions that I didn't answer let me know via e-mail.]

A-C are good responses, it all depends on what you want and what you're willing to give up.

It's not a move I would play though, I would probably play at C or enclose the corner, in an even game.  One good strategy in a handicap game is to make the game confusing enough to where black can't follow and starts making mistakes, I assume that's why white played this way.]

mjr: Not really.  There are still bigger points on the board.  But you shouldn't play them. There is urgency on the board.  Your middle group NEEDS attention.  It's stranded without a base and very weak.  You should settle it, so that it doesn't get attacked more than it is.  Otherwise, white will seal in your corner and connect his two groups just by attacking you.]

Now black's middle group is (finally) out of immediate danger.  What has white gained by attacking it?  (Check variation).

But not all is bad.  White's marked group is also slightly weak and can be attacked.  White made a mistake and tried too hard to kill you.

The top is still pretty open.  I'd go after that next.]
