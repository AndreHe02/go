C[Hi,

I am only just a beginner and I do not know yet how to put my  play in language - its from your revieuw I get some analytical languistic  advice : I play and learn to talk your hands ! - so please forgive me I made  no comments in this game ... also I promise to do learn the language  approach for my next review request ...
I thank you in advance ...

Best regards,
Joeri Ramon


Hi Joeri,   It looks like you both had fun playing.  I hope my comments give you some things to think about when you  play. Please let me know if anything I said is unclear.

One thing that will improve your play is looking ahead a few  moves. Two times, you played into a "shicho" or "ladder", and  gave several stones to your opponent without getting much in  return. With practice, you will recognize shicho in time to  avoid it, or at least soon enough to cut your losses.

Another thing that will help is judging moves before you make  them, and looking for bigger moves.  A few times, you made a  move that was worth only 1 point, when there were far more  urgent moves available.

But I think most important is to keep playing, and to pay  attention while you play, and to try new things to see what  happens. Consider playing some 9x9 games, because they are the  best way to get experience quickly.  Between games, I recommend  the GTL's sister site, Go Problems (http://www.goproblems.com),  as a convenient way to get better at life and death.

Best wishes,  - Mike Malveaux];B[do];W[pd];B[pq];W[dd];B[di]
TR[dq][po][qn][qo][pn]MA[ck][cl][cm]C[The first two moves were fine, but this wide, high extension is unusual, and it seems out of balance with the Q3 stone. A play around D3 or R5 would be more normal, making what the Japanese call a "shimari" -- a corner enclosure. By not enclosing one of the corners, you invite White to attack at a point near D3 or Q5. Or, White can invade the left side at a spot near C8, because the extension to D11 is so wide.]
;W[pm];B[on]TR[qo][po]C[This would be better at R5 or Q5. The move at P6 will encourage White to make a safe base along the side; and the gap between Q3 and P6 is too wide to be secure. White can either cut the stone off, or use the threat of cutting to invade the lower side. For these reasons, I don't like P6.]
;W[fc]C[This is odd. It is a good move, but it would be better for White to take advantage of Black's gap in the lower right.]
;B[pk]C[This is ambitious. White should be able to live.];W[om]
;B[nl];W[dp]TR[dq]C[This is not so good for White. It would be better to approach from a slight distance, like D3. Attacking with a contact play is often a bad choice, because it causes the opponent to make a strong group.]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[dq];W[fp];B[cp]C[Good for Black.];W[fq];B[fo]
;W[go];B[fn]C[This sequence was better for Black than White. Black's probable territory on the left side is larger than White's probable territory on the lower side.]
;W[dh]TR[nq][op][dg][cg]C[This is not such a good move for White. It would be better to play around O3 or P4.

In general, contact plays like this will strengthen the opponent. When White makes a contact play like this, Black's next moves will make Black strong. For this reason, it is usually better to approach from a slight distance. D13 or C13 would be better for White.]
;B[gp]TR[ci][ch][cf]C[Oops! Black has played a stone that can be captured in a "shicho" -- called a "ladder" in English, though it usually looks more like a staircase.

A play around C11, C12, or C14 would be more usual.];W[hp];B[gq]
TR[qf][nm][mq][ch][gn]C[As the next moves show, Black cannot escape here. It is better to accept the loss, and move to a part of the board where you can do some good, such as O7, N3, R14, or C12.

Another idea is to use the "aji" (potential) of the dead stone to expand your territory in "sente". For example, when you play at G6, you make your territory bigger; and since White has to answer at H5 or G3, you get to make another move somewhere else.]
;W[gr];B[hq];W[iq];B[hr];W[hs];B[ir];W[jr];B[er];W[is]C[This is much worse for Black than if you had just given up one or two stones.]
;B[fr]C[This is small, worth only one point in the final score. It would be better to play elsewhere. For example, a play at N3 would be worth at least 8 points; Q6 also would be a bigger play.]
;W[gq]C[Unneccessary. White wastes a move.];B[dr]C[This will be necessary eventually, but meanwhile, there are bigger plays you should make.]
;W[en]C[What? This attack cannot succeed. "Play away from strength."]
;B[em]C[Good.];W[ci];B[cj];W[ch];B[dj];W[bi];B[bj];W[aj];B[ak]
;W[ai];B[bk]C[Good.];W[eh];B[nm]C[Finally! This is a very important move, and you should have played it sooner. The game would have been much harder if White had gone at O7 instead of G3, for instance.]
;W[qf]C[Interesting. White leaves the two stones at P7-Q7. If White lives here, it will make a big hole in Black's territory.]
;B[pi]TR[qh]C[Good, but I like R12 or R11 better. It can be dangerous to let your opponent have a stone lower than you near the boundaries of the territories.]
;W[pg];B[nq]C[Good.];W[lq];B[lo];W[kp];B[jn];W[ho];B[hn]TR[kc]
C[Linking up your groups like this is very good.

Another good idea is to get a foothold on the top side, invading at L17. Whites corners are also open to invasion at the 3-3 point.]
;W[io]C[With White making small moves like this, Black should win easily. Since the White group cannot be killed, and since this move does not separate the Black groups, there is no need for White to play here. Something like O17 or L16 would be much bigger for White.]
;B[jo];W[jp];B[in];W[ko];B[kn];W[lp];B[mp];W[mq];B[mn]TR[mo]
C[Good, protecting the cut at N5. But a cut remains at O4 which may be troublesome later.

It is not yet a big concern, but as you get stronger, you will need to choose your plays with ko threats in mind. If you played at N5 instead of N6, it would leave fewer ko threats for White to use later.]
;W[mr];B[nr];W[ns];B[os];W[ms];B[pr];W[gn];B[fm]TR[gm]C[Perhaps you looked at this wrong, and thought you were in atari. It is better to simply close White in with G7. (White cannot play the double atari at E6, because in doing so, White's stones are also put in atari, and Black can just capture at D6.)]
;W[gm];B[gl];W[hm];B[hl];W[ei];B[im];W[fs];B[es]C[Too small -- only worth 1 point in the final score. Look for bigger moves when the life of your group is not threatened.]
;W[gs];B[fl]C[This would be better at E10.];W[ej];B[ek];W[hh]
C[White seeks to expand. Black will have to invade.];B[fj];W[gi]
;B[fi];W[fh];B[gj];W[gh]C[What? Much better would be H10. White actually filled in a potential eye -- not that White needs eyes here; but under Japanese scoring, this would actually reduce White's score by 1.]
;B[rh]C[Good, sealing the edges of the territory, and getting a lower position which may help with an invasion.]
;W[rg];B[qh];W[sh];B[si];W[sg];B[ri];W[ph];B[oh];W[og];B[ng]
;W[mg];B[nh];W[nf];B[mh];W[lg];B[qg];W[kh]C[White is leaving weak spots in the wall.]
;B[rf];W[re];B[sf];W[qe];B[lh];W[hg]C[This move makes no sense to me.]
;B[ki];W[kg];B[jh];W[ji];B[jj];W[ii];B[lj];W[se];B[qc]TR[kc]
C[The 3-3 invasion may be too late. With White's strong stones nearby, White should be able to kill this stone (see variation).

However, Black should be able to invade and live around L17 still. White's wall across the center is a little too far away to protect the top edge.]

(;W[rb]TR[pc]C[White has a better defense at Q17.];B[mf]C[Good, exploiting the cutting points White left behind.]
;W[lf];B[me];W[ne];B[nd];W[le];B[md];W[ld];B[of]C[Double atari. White surely regrets leaving weak spots in the wall.]
;W[pf]C[This looks like the move that lost the game for White. It saves the wrong stones. It would be better for White to give up the three stones, rather than forcing Black to save the 4 stones around N16, which also gives Black a wedge into White's territory. After this, Black has a good chance of killing White's corner.]
;B[oe];W[od];B[pe];W[pc]C[White must not see the danger of the cut at R16.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[jg];B[oc]C[This is a very big loss for White.]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[lb];B[pb];W[na];B[mb];W[ma];B[nb];W[oa];B[pa]
;W[la]TR[cc][qo]C[White does not need to do this until later. Right now, White should look for a bigger move, like C17 or R5.]
;B[ob]TR[pn][cc]C[This is a wasted move. Even if White plays P18, it does not affect the score, and it does not threaten Black. So Black would do better with a move like Q6 or C17.]
;W[ij];B[hj]TR[jk]C[Probably it would be better to block White at J9. This would leave some cutting points, but White cannot do very much with them. If the cutting points worry you, defend your territory at K9 instead.

In general, in a situation like this, White wants to extend into your territory to chip points off your final score. White cannot kill any Black stones, and White cannot make territory, so White wants to simply reduce Black's score a little. Of course, Black wants to keep as many points as possible. Black should Block in the direction where there are more points to lose. There are only 3 or 4 points in danger to the left, which is why Black should defend the right side, where White might be able to destroy 7 or 8 points.]

C[Yes, there still seems to be plenty of room for an invasion here. The strong White wall may be too far away to help defend the corner.]

;W[ln];B[kf]TR[kn][mo]C[L14 is not at all important. Why not capture back at L6? (It's not a ko.) Or, at least save your stone with N5.

This is my last comment. Thanks for the chance to review the game.]
