C[Comments: Andre Bergholz, (2K) in Germany, berge on IGS, NNGS (Comments marked  with AB)

[Hi.  I played Black in this game.
I've recognized some mistakes
in retrospect, but I'd like to hear
more knowledgeable comments.

As nothought is my friend,  I'd like to see comments on W's
playing too. I hope I'm not asking too  much. :-)

I'm enclosing my comments and  and questions in square
brackets.

Thanks in advance,
Rafael Caetano \]];B[qd]C[AB: First of all, after I browsed quickly through the game I think that both of you played quite well, especially in the opening. You have many questions there but I think for the moment it is more important to focus on the middle game, ultimately the game was decided by the misread sequence on the left side.]
;W[cc];B[pq];W[cq];B[oc];W[qj];B[qn]LB[qh:a][qm:b][qo:c]C[[Since I like to play "solid", I was
happy to make two enclosures.

But should B play at 'a' instead?
What would W do? If W 'b', I'd
make another enclosure at 'c' anyway.
But if W plays kakari at 'c', I wouldn't
know what to do. \]

AB: I think your move is good, your intuition that making two shimari's can't be bad is right. 'C' would be a good alternative, too. Even though 'A' is certainly big it is not bigger that the move you played.]
;W[qg]C[AB: Big, but maybe K4 would be even bigger.];B[iq]LB[jq:a]
[cn:b]C[[I know that the usual extension is at 'a',
but I thought it wouldn't hurt to play a
little farther.

My (loose) reasoning was that this
way a move around would be more
effective, but now this doesn't sound
convincing for me.

Anyway, I don't see it as a "wrong" move.  Am I right? \]

AB: It's certainly not totally wrong, though I think 'A' is better. Your shimari is large (meaning a little loose) and so this far extension means that White will have little problems reducing it. I know the desire to grab as much as possible but often that doesn't work so well.]

(;W[kq]LB[jd:A][fc:B][dj:C][on:D][jp:E]C[[Premature?\]

AB: Absolutely. And locally not the best choice either. I think K16, F17, D10 ('A', 'B', 'C') are all more interesting right now. If White wants to reduce the lower right, P6 and K4 ('D' and 'E') seem good to me (see for instance variation).]
;B[mq]LB[fq:a][nq:b]C[[Better at 'a'?

I wouldn't want W to play at 'b', because
the B enclosure seems a bit thin for me.\]

AB: Good move.];W[ko];B[io]LB[fq:a]C[AB: Good again.];W[fq]
LB[mo:A]C[AB: Better at 'A'. Black 'A' will put heavy pressure on the White stones.]

(;B[im]LB[mo:a]C[[Better at 'a'? \]

AB: Yes, definitely. That will give you a nice territory and White some tough times (see variation).]
;W[km];B[jk];W[nn];B[pk]LB[po:A]C[[I meant to do something like a leaning
attack, but...\]

AB: Yes, a move like 'A' would have been good. Sometimes such a slow-looking move is much more powerful, because afterwards you can attack to the fullest.]
;W[po]C[[... then I saw my corner was really
thin. What should B have done? \]];B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq]
(;B[qq]LB[or:a][pr:b]C[[Is 'a' possible?\]

AB: I don't think so (see variations). On the other hand, 'B' is.]
;W[or];B[pj]TR[pk]LB[qk:A]C[AB: I'm not sure about this development. The marked stone was not so great in the first place, and now White is alive so there is no point in pursuing the idea of building influence there any further (at least not for the moment). Maybe later on you would rather want to take profit with 'A' instead.]
;W[qk];B[pi];W[qi];B[kr]C[AB: Now tenuki on the right is risky. White can turn your three stones into a terrible mess (see variation for next move).]

(;W[jp];B[ip];W[lr];B[jr];W[lq]C[[I guess this sequence favored W.\]

AB: Not necessarily. I guess you expected to connect your stones, which was not possible, but the result is not bad. Look at it as a sente-endgame :-).]
;B[ph]C[AB: Very important.];W[pg]LB[qh:a]C[[Somehow I expected this would be at 'a',
so I could make a nice wall at Q13.\]

AB: First, that was wishful thinking :-). Thankfully you have an opponent who can do whatever he wants. Second, even then I think Q13 would not be your best choice, because you 'pull the cart from behind', i.e., your opponent is always one step ahead of you. A very important point is to try to get ahead (see 'Lessons in the fundamentals of go'). So, after White 'A' you should play something like P14 instead.]
;B[qh]C[[Now this move strikes me as aji keshi.\]

AB: A little bit, yes. However, it only destroys the aji of playing something like S12 later on. Not too bad, especially if you want to continue locally with P13.]
;W[rh];B[dd]LB[ql:A]C[[I don't know why I played this way.
It seems that the situation at the side is not finished yet.

Anyway, I don't know how to play there.\]

AB: Yes, your stones on the right become more and more of a burden. See variation for a next move for a rather severe White attack. I think Black 'A' is really urgent and good.]

(;W[dc];B[ed];W[be];B[dg]
(;W[gb]C[[This seems a bit slow.  Shouldn't  W play at the right side?\]

AB: The joseki is shown in the variation. The White move is too loose, I think Black can play something like the variation for next move.]

(;B[og]C[AB: Important.];W[ql]LB[pl:A]C[AB: 'A' would be even more severe.]
;B[of]LB[rg:a]TR[gb]C[[I was happy to play this P14, but
now I'm not so sure whether it
was so important.  I mean, what could
W do here? The defect at 'a' seems
to prevent a W breakthrough here.
But I'm too weak at reading. :-( \]

AB: For the safety of the Black group your move is very good. It is true that the marked White stone somewhat reduces the thickness but I think you played the right move.]

(;W[ck]C[AB: Very big. But I wonder if there is a more subtle way for White to attack. Both the upper left and the lower middle Black group are not so strong. The variation is of course pure phantasy but the purpose is just to give some inspiration of what may be possible.]
;B[cm]C[AB: Again, I think this is a premature invasion. I often see the tendency that people cannot accept that the opponent gets any territory. Now I think White can really start a severe attack. Of course, White would have to be more skillful than me :-). Anyway, for an attempt see variation for next move.]

(;W[em];B[dl];W[dk];B[el];W[ek];B[fl];W[ch];B[dp];W[dq];B[cg]
C[[I misread this sequence. I thought
I could cut W's groups\]

AB: Well, yes, that sequence basically lost the game. At this point now the game is not bad for Black, if he can manage to get something from the upper right.]
;W[bg]
(;B[bf]C[AB: Even if the cut worked it is not necessarily good. The upper White group is alive anyway and the Black stones  are weaker than the lower White group, I think. The variation is simple and not bad.]
;W[cf];B[bh];W[af];B[bi];W[ci];B[bj];W[bk];B[cj];W[eh];B[ei]
;W[dj]C[[Since the damage was already done,
I tried at least to make something
out of my 3 lost stones.\]

AB: It's four, no :-).];B[di];W[dh];B[fh];W[eg];B[fg];W[df]

(;B[fj]C[AB: It's difficult to give a good advice after such a horror sequence, but this move is not good I think. Protecting the two stones is not really important and the next White move is really big (see variation for a possible development).]
;W[ff];B[gf];W[fe];B[ge];W[fd];B[gd];W[gc];B[jd];W[jb];B[kc]
;W[kb];B[rf]LB[lc:A]C[AB: I think Black 'A' is absolutely necessary here.]

(;W[rg]C[AB: See variations starting with M17...];B[ep];W[fp]
;B[fo];W[bo];B[lk]LB[lc:A]C[[This seems big. Should W have played
here before?

Well, from now on it's endgame,
Maybe I did lose because of poor
endgame, but of course there's no need  to comment.
There's one more comment of mine but you
can ignore it if you want.\]

AB: Yes, this definitely big but 'A' is still the biggest.]
;W[nk];B[mj];W[nj];B[ni];W[mk];B[lj];W[mc]LB[lc:a]C[[Isn't N17 an overplay? What if
B cuts at M18?

Anyway, W 'a' would be big enough

(end of questions :-)\]

AB: I don't think the M18 cut is possible for Black. Anyway, I think White should have played M17, which is very effective as I have demonstrated before.]

(;B[lc];W[lb];B[md];W[nc];B[nd];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[rm]C[AB: Seems good.]

;B[hq];W[fr];B[sm];W[jo];B[jm];W[kn]C[AB: Altogether this was a pretty good game that was decided by the bad sequence on the left side. There are some strategical things like when to invade, attacking and defending weak groups, etc. and some oversights like M17 or F14. But this is all minor when it comes to such a big loss like the one on the left. If you have any more questions you can reach me by email: Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com]
