C[=BB I am black, my opponent is white

buckyyowza: hello! i am mark fyffe from terre haute, indiana. i've only
been formally rated on igs, and have been between 10k and 13k for a
little while (approximately 6 kyu AGA). it is a pleaure to look over
your game, and also to answer any additional questions you may have if i
don't explain good enough in this review.  as i am only as strong as an
american 6 kyu, please take my advice with a grain of salt :-)]
;B[dp];W[qd];B[po]
(;W[pq]LB[po:A][od:B][dc:C][pq:D]C[I have difficulty responding to an  aggressive opening

buckyyowza: actually, the aggressive move was at A (q5).  the 5-4 point,
called "takamoku" or "high point" is the most aggressive of the common
opening moves.  D (q3) is a common reply to your move.  if your opponent
had played at C (d17), your takamoku would aim nicely at joseki starting
at B (p16) (see variation starting at the previous move). now, you are
free to play out joseki in the lower right corner or play for the upper
left (at C for example). there is no special need to respond to D at
this point, so it wasn't necessarily an aggressive move :)]
;B[qq];W[pp]C[buckyyowza: this is not the greatest move in the world for white, in
case you were curious :)];B[qp]LB[np:A]C[buckyyowza: this is why... you've got excellent shape and white has
poor shape.  white has very few options at this point that either
accomplish much or retain sente. if he fails to respond to your move, a
black stone at A (o5) puts white in a bad position.];W[np];B[mo]
LB[jp:A][oo:B]C[buckyyowza: i'm not sure what you meant to accomplish here. white p5
cuts n5 from q5 (see variations) and gives white plenty of momentum for
expansion, significantly reducing the influence of your nice shape. n5
has a way to go to reach d4.  with no clear connection and no
significant threat on white's group, n5 is what is known as bad aji. if
you meant to squeeze white from the left, A (k4) would do much nicer; if
you meant to prevent expansion and build influence on the right, B (p5).]

[np][op][oo][pp][pq]C[I also frequently end up spreading my  stones too t=
hin in the process of trying to  contain my opponent

buckyyowza: they look fine to me. white has a much worse position here
-- none of your stones are in significant danger (note that atari
doesn't necessarily mean danger) and white is easily enclosed (see
variation).]
(;B[nn];W[kp]
(;B[ln]LB[lq:A]TR[mp][np][op][oo][pp][pq]C[buckyyowza: A (m3) is much better, your move pretty much ruin its
effectiveness. after m3, white's marked stones are good as gone.  i
played with a few variations and couldn't find a way for white to kill
m4 or save the marked group. see variations on move 20 for examples of
how this is probably true.  i think what is messing you up is you are
seeing things one line lower than they really are. if all this was on
the third line, the black stone would be a goner.];W[ko];B[mm]
C[I think that this was a wasted move at =
this  time... I should have used my stone  better, I think

buckyyowza: not urgent, but certainly not wasted. your influence on the
right is enviable. your only problem now is white has sente... but
you've got a nice lead.];W[fq]
(;B[eq]LB[hq:A][dn:B][cn:C][cm:D][lq:E]C[buckyyowza: not the joseki i would have played. this one gives white a
huge expanding group on the lower side. B (d6), C (c6), and D (c7) would
have worked on the left side a bit, still holding half a corner, and A
would have brought back the threat of E (m3) (see variations on move 24
for examples)];W[fp]LB[dn:A]C[This upcoming sequence (26-48) is  interesting to m=
e... What could I have  done, if anything, to recapture this  corner?

buckyyowza: previous comments have explained how to use m3 properly. the
best thing to do here is to follow up with a joseki move like A (d6).  there is currently no threat on the lower right corner.]
;B[lq]C[buckyyowza: too late :(... you've just dropped a stone in white
territory. any further effort here will only make things worse.]
;W[kq];B[mq];W[pr];B[nq]LB[qr:A]C[buckyyowza: A (r2) is urgent to prevent white from sliding into the
corner.];W[lr];B[oq]LB[qr:A]C[buckyyowza: white has no need to respond to p3, A (r2) is pretty much
your only move.];W[qr];B[or]LB[rr:A]C[buckyyowza: same as last time, only here you should have played A
(s2).];W[rq];B[rp];W[sq];B[sp];W[rs]LB[qo:A]C[buckyyowza: white wins this battle in sente. A (r5) is the proper
followup move.];B[sr];W[rr];B[ps];W[mr];B[os];W[ns];B[qs]C[buckyyowza: i can't tell how many times i've kicked myself for doing
stuff like this ;)];W[nr];B[qm]LB[qo:A]C[buckyyowza: A (r5) is best here because it prevents a ko threat later
in the game. white hasn't got a way to invade your right side because of
that huge wall, so there is no need to grab territory. the simplest
defense is usually the best];W[od];B[dd];W[fd];B[ec]LB[df:A]
TR[cc]C[buckyyowza: this is a pretty weak move. the joseki move (A, d14) is
probably your best choice. there is no need to directly block a stone on
the fourth line from crawling under your star point, it is more likely
to be auxiliary to a corner invasion. even worse, white is still free to
make a san-san invasion because of the stone at f15 (see variation), so
your stone fails to effectively protect the corner.]
(;W[fc];B[ed]C[buckyyowza: this doesn't accomplish much besides bad shape (weak empty
triangle).];W[ic];B[fe];W[ie];B[gd];W[gc];B[fb];W[ge];B[ef]
;W[he];B[fi];W[dj]LB[dh:A][cg:B][fh:C]TR[ln][mm]C[What could I have done here to  maintain hold of the left side of the=
  board?   Would it have been better to  play closerr to the edge to ma=
intain  control?

buckyyowza: most certainly so!  the 6th line has almost no territorial
influence. f11 looks more like an expansion from a loosely held corner
than a territorial move on the left side. if left side territory is your
aim, try A (d12) or B (c13).  if it wasn't for the nice center influence
coming from the area around the marked stones, a expansive move would be
more in order... but even then, a tighter extension would be better
(such as C, f12).];B[ek];W[dh]TR[fi][ef]C[buckyyowza: white cannot be killed, and should be stopped from cutting
the marked stones];B[dg];W[dk];B[ei];W[cm];B[di];W[ci];B[ch]
;W[bh];B[eh]LB[cg:A]C[buckyyowza: this is common mistake: an itchy trigger finger ;). better
to play at A (c13) to keep white from getting into your territory.]

C[Wasted move...Should have used it  elsewhere, I think...

buckyyowza: yeah, but you haven't changed the score and haven't lost
sente... so really nothing has changed.];W[cj];B[em]TR[dp][eq]
LB[cp:A]C[buckyywoza: i'd be more concerned about the marked stones at this
point. A (c4) would probably be your best move.];W[cf];B[ce]
;W[be];B[bd];W[de];B[cd];W[bf];B[df]C[buckyyowza: itchy trigger finger again. you've gained 3 points and
lost sente... big mistake.];W[cp]TR[dp][eq]C[buckyyowza: these stones are dead now.]
;B[dn];W[do];B[eo];W[ep]C[From here, is there anything that I  co=
uld do to save that lower left group?

buckyyowza: seems like you're just thinking about these things too late
:-)];B[dq];W[cq];B[er];W[fr];B[fs];W[gs];B[es];W[dr];B[ae]C[buckyyowza: 1 point yose (endgame) move that fails to keep sente. this
sort of move should only be played when you're just about ready to start
passing. at this point in the game, it is the same as passing.]
;W[af];B[ad];W[fo];B[en];W[hn];B[jn]TR[gc][fc][fd][ge][he][ie]
[ic][od][qd]C[Here I am trying to keep the white's  l=
ower right and lower left families  separate... Could I have gone about=
 it  in a better way?

buckyyowza: nope, white has two very alive 5th line walls, there is no
need to cut them, much less a way to. not to sound grim, but at this
point you've lost the game unless you can come up with a good plan for
invading the upper side, killing some of the marked stones, and building
a gigantic moyo along the right side. quite a daunting task!]

thing up (see variation on move 135).];B[ij];W[gi];B[gh];W[io]
;B[jo];W[jp];B[il]TR[jk][jl][jm]LB[ld:A][pg:B][qf:C]C[buckyyowza: these stones have plenty of momentum to reach the upper
side now. your best plan of attack would be to try to use their aji to
cut white at A (m16) or try to start building moyo with some loose
territorial plays on the right side (like B,q13 or C,r14).]
;W[jj];B[fj]LB[ii:A]C[buckyyowza: not to keep harping on this, but A (j14) is much better.
itchy trigger finger ;)];W[kl];B[lm];W[lj];B[mk];W[kh];B[cn]
;W[bn];B[bk]C[Again, a wasted move, I think

buckyyowza: white needs to respond, so it isn't bad... but it
accomplishes nothing so it isn't good. this sort of move is great as a
ko threat or if you run into time trouble in the end game and you want
to get into the next byo-yomi period to get more time to think.]

territory and  attacking the corner territory...  I think it  cost me i=
n the end...

buckyyowza: white has made it to the upper side, which will make a side  invasion difficult. a corner invasion is nigh impossible now. you really
need to concentrate on the right side in order to avoid a very sad
ending.];W[nd];B[nf]LB[qf:A]C[buckyyowza: A (r14) is urgent.]
;W[qf];B[qg];W[qh];B[pg]LB[rg:A]C[buckyyowza: thinking on the wrong line again. on the second line, the
would have been correct, but in this case A (s13) is perfectly fine. in
fact, white's last move was wasted.];W[rg]
(;B[ri]LB[rf:A]C[buckyyowza: A (s14) is the best move here to either prevent white's
invasion or to invade the upper side as compensation (see variations on
move 172). s11 allows white to invade your territory.];W[rh]

plays, and your opening was much stronger than your opponent's. what you
really need to work on is what part of the board  to concentrate on, how
to recognize threatened groups, and keeping sente... but then again,
don't we all? :-)

it has been a pleasure looking over your game, and i hope my comments
have helped... if i appeared too critical at times, please accept my
apologies, i only inteded to point out some bad plays or bad
situations.  if you have trouble understanding any of the japanese terms
i use in my comments, check the intergo dictionary on jan van der
steen's website (http://www.cwi.nl/people/jansteen/intergo/index.html).
or just ask me

like i said before, if you have any further questions, feel free to
email me at mark.fyffe@rose-hulman.edu or run into me on igs (my account
names are aheimlich and buckyyowza).  you might even be able to talk me
into playing a quick game :-)   best wishes,
