In other words - B's thickness in the center has given him secure territory in the corner. This is how thickness is supposed to work, but it didn't have to be this big!

See the other ways of invading/reducing I showed you earlier.]

Practice very basic reading problems (something you think is "WAY TOO EASY") - the goal should be 10 seconds per problem... it will help you "see" situations like this...

Eventually you will be able to "see" the fact that playing at E8 is a very big move. (and you will be able to see that you're in such a situation immediately after G7 has been played)]

You also seem to have the problem of thinking that you can attack any group. The definition of 'thickness' is something that is 99% __ALIVE__ and has strong outward influence. Walls cannot be attacked _and_ should not be considered territory. It may be counter-intuitive at this point, but walls are used for attack. Extending from a wall is to create moyo, not territory. They are not the same thing because, when someone invades the moyo, you use the wall to attack it by pushing the invading group against the wall.]
