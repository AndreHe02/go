C[This is a game against HandTalk 98.06.

Playing with no handicap is "ambitious" for me.  A 5 stone handicap is much more likely to lead to a win, but I want to work on my fuseki.]

(;B[pc]C[How important is it to play here?  I do it habitually.
Holo: It is not so important. There is a risk for black, that white invades the corner. But he will not get eyes there. So can invade only, when his position is strong. I assume you play another move:]

C[I've heard 5 point jumps are good, but when I try them, HandTalk dives in.  I, on the
other hand, wouldn't know what to do after diving.
Holo: A 5 point jump is a very loose play. It can mostly be invaded. So the 5 point jump does not secure territory, He threatenes to make a large territory, whe extending from it, for example, when adding stones at a and b.
Whe you invade there, both groups struggle into the center, but white is better off, because his influence is at the outside, and can be used for attack. I added a variation.]

(;B[qg];W[pl];B[kb]MA[cg]C[Holo: a move around the mark would have been better. This white group is very weak.]

(;B[dr]C[I'm hoping to steal the corner, to force white to run out into the middle.
Holo: Good];W[er];B[es];W[em];B[br]MA[oi][mi][ml][mo]C[Holo: The territory seems to be divided. So let us count.
black has:
20 points in the upper left
15 points in the upper right
10 points at the left side
10 points at the bottom
white has:
6 points at the top
30 points at the lower right
So black is far off. All black has to do is not to allow white to get significant more territory than black in the center. You have to look for potential territory for both sides. For white the territory with the marked points look good. So must must try to develop a strategy, to allowing white to get this territory or get or get own in reverse. One possibility is to attack the 2 white weak groups. I added a simple variation.]
;W[bh]
(;B[ci]C[Same question as before - is it important to double up in this kind of circumstance?
Holo: You have always a diagonal connection. So it is not necessary. The possible threat in such a situation is the connection with a. But because of your diagonal connection it does not work. See variation.]
;W[eh];B[ap]C[Holo: Unnecessary, the black stones are almost secure.]
;W[ho];B[bq]C[Holo: Unnecessary as before.];W[pf];B[qf];W[fp]
;B[hq];W[oo];B[ph]C[So the edges are all staked out - I'm starting to crawl out into the middle, hoping to keep white from taking too much of the center.
Holo: Thats right, but you should use the weakness of the white stones.]
;W[pi];B[oh];W[rh]
(;B[lg]TR[lc][lb][oc][ob][od][pe][pf]C[Here, I'm abandoning my crawl, and hoping to put a little pressure on the marked stones, while increasing the area I have facing the center.]

(;B[db]C[Holo: Also unnecessary, see variation];W[hj];B[gf]
C[Holo: Too slow. Try to see the potiential territories. Then try to use or destroy them. You have just secured about 10 points, the next white move secures nearly 20 points.]
;W[jk];B[je];W[lk]
(;B[jh]C[This feels small, but I don't really know what else to do.
Holo: In general there are 2 possibilities to reduce your opponents territory.  1) You run out from secure positions. This is the secure way, but it is slow and always allowes the opponent to block.
2) You invade, and connect to either side. This is more risky, but your opponent has to block either side.
Applying to this situation, you should invade (you had to do it 2 or 3 move earlier. Now it is more difficult. But i added a variation.]

))
(;B[bd]C[Is this effective?  I always do a keima (or rarely, a pincer) when an opponent approaches my corner.
Holo: There is a slight difference. Attaching enemy stones makes both groups usually stronger. In most cases the opponent adds a stone. With the keima you avoid this. But there is another possibility. Usually it is bad to place stones on the second line in the beginning (too low). These stones can be suppressed. That means, they are allowed to make a small life, but you get outward influence in return.]

(;B[kb]LB[lb:a]C[This is my first thought: attack, threaten an eye-eating monkey jump.  But I'm worried about white pincering me.
Holo: The first thought is quite right: you are really threaten the life of the group. So white will not pincer, but first secure calmly the life of his group with a. After that the goup is secure. But this is aji-keshi. The real threat you have is for example the move in the variation. I added also a variation with the pincer to show that there is nothing to worry about.]
