RU[Japanese]

C[I played black in this game.  Please comment for both sides.

pto: I am pto, 6 kyu from Finland. I am not book learner, so my comments are not formal, I just tell what I think.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[op];W[mp]C[pto: To this point this is standard fuseki.]

(;B[po]LB[on:2][po:A][mp:1][qq:B]C[Would this be better at P6?  I played this move intending to move towards the right side and hoping that white would take the lower side in exchange.

pto: Yes, ikken tobi seems better. It seems to be standard responce in pro games.

pto: When black pushes toward right, he doesn't give white 1 any presure. That is why it is easy for white to counter simply defending right side. If black had played a move like 2, white would not have been able to defend both sides.]
;W[pp];B[oq]LB[oo:A][qo:B]C[Now I am trying to seperate white's groups.  Looking back now, however, they both look strong.  Would R5 be better locally?

pto: White corner is not too strong, but black is weak too. The cut at A is important point. If black would take it, he would be in good position to fight. B would not do much good for black because of the cut. Even if black would gain some influence on right side, white would make huge teritory that is difficult to compete.

proverb: Make your own groups strong first, then attack.];W[oo]
;B[qo]C[After the cut I decided to try to take the corner while threatening the two white corner stones.]
;W[ro];B[qq];W[pn];B[pq];W[rp];B[mr]LB[rr:A]C[I thought that this look safe for now

pto: That corner was developing into very complicated fight. This is simple solution, but white is much better of. Compare this to the joseki (starting at move 7).

pto: Black group is pretty safe, as long as he can run to left. White has nasty moves around A that can reduse this corner. White gained huge thickness on the right side.]
;W[fc]LB[dj:A][pj:B]C[pto: This white move is not good, I think. With standard joseki black settles his group on left side and if white does the same in upper side, black will gain sente to take big points on the left or right side.]
;B[cf];W[cj]C[pto: White took big point but left some unfinished business on upper side. Black should try to use this to gain advantage.]
;B[ic];W[fe];B[ie];W[qf]C[pto: Again, white took big point leaving unfinished business.]
;B[mc]LB[pj:A]C[I had trouble deciding where to play this stone.  I also considered the right side, but worried about the strong white stones in the lower right.  Looking at it now, the lower side is still wide open.

pto: This seems good, at least localy. Black has nice framework on upper right corner. Black would expect white to settle right side with move somewhere around A. After that black could take sente and play big moves on lower side. Or he could try to pursue weak white group at upper corner.

pto: If black plays pincer, white will propably jump to center leaving black in uneasy position.]
;W[md]LB[lc:1][nc:2]TR[fc][fe]C[I thought that this was an invasion rather than a reducing move because of my stone at J15.

pto: This stone will be difficult to capture, but it is perfect stone to tease. The danger is that it may work with marked stoned in future. Perhaps a move at 1 or 2 to take solid position.]
;B[oe]TR[md]C[pto: This is nice move that performs large scale attack on white. Black should not wory marked white stone too much, instead he should aim for the right side.]
;W[nd]C[pto: White could try to play hane and try to cut black. Result would be serius fight for both.]
;B[nc];W[od];B[oc]TR[pe]C[I was happy with this exchange.

pto: White is not well off but is still pretty safe because of cutting points in black shape. White should cut now and black would have difficult times ahead.]
;W[ld];B[lc]C[pto: This change is nice for white, who gains strength to make the cut.]
;W[jd];B[kd];W[ke];B[kc];W[je]C[pto: Now white has all the strength he needst to make the cut. Unfortunatelly it is black turn.]
;B[mf]TR[pe]C[pto: Black has safe position on upper side so he can now attack. With connection, black can push to center and destroy white influence. The correct target is not capturing those white stones, but to destroy white framework.

pto: This move is good, because it prevents white cut and pushes forward. This stone should be treated lightly - be ready to sacrifice it.]
;W[ne]
(;B[le]LB[le:A][pe:B][nf:A]C[I was still pleased with this exchange so far.

pto: I think this move is mistake - wrong target. It gives white opportunity to get out and cut black (as he did). Black A leads to fierce figth (see variation). Black B is simple solution.]
;W[nf];B[kf];W[jf];B[mg];W[of];B[pe];W[pf]TR[le][kf][mf][mg]
C[Now I was not so happy with the exchange.

pto: So what went wrong? If that marked black group were connected to the upper side group, all would be fine.

pto: Mistake was: black tried direct capture. That doesn't usually work. Had he left the white group at top side alone, he could have pushed to right side and separate these groups. Now white would have to decide which one to defend.]
;B[qj]LB[qm:A]TR[le][kf][mf][mg]SQ[jd][je][ke][jf]C[This side looked like it was getting very big for white.  Would something like P10 be better?  Should I have just ignored this and played on the bottom instead?

pto: Now white can separate black groups with single move. I think black should first try to strengthen his marked group by attacking marked white group. After that black could threaten the large white group at upper right corner and use that to reduce that framework. Peep at A could come handy for black.

pto: Playing on right side is painfull for black, but it must be done at some point of game.]
;W[qk]C[pto: If you want to kill it - don't touch it!];B[oi]
;W[qi];B[pj];W[rj];B[rk];W[ri];B[pk]TR[po][qo]C[pto: This is safe way to do things and perhaps globally better.  But with this marked black stones lose their aji.]
;W[ql];B[rl]C[Looking back now, I am not sure what I had planned with this move.  O9 looks good now.

pto: O9 is vital point, but it feels somehow slow. Q8 is small sente and ajikeshi (loses aji).]
;W[pl];B[qe]LB[re:1]C[pto: Bad shape, how about 1 instead?]
;W[re];B[qc];W[rd];B[fq]C[pto: Good, upper corner is small compared to this. And black has weak groups to wory about too.]
;W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[kq];W[ho];B[dq]TR[fo]C[Would  D2 be better for making a base in the corner?

pto: Now marked stone can be cut and white central influence could become very troublesome. Keima at D2 is solid.]
;W[ep];B[cq]C[Taking the corner looked bigger than trying to save the stone at F5.

pto: F5 is big, but if black tries to save it, white might take his eyes. White influence just keeps increasing.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[dr];B[cr];W[fr];B[ds];W[fp];B[bo];W[cp];B[bp]
;W[bm]LB[cm:A]SQ[le][kf][mf][mg][oi][pj][qj][pk]C[Does white need to do this now?  I thought that it was rather small.

pto: White needs it to prevent black A. Nothing more I think. White could start to tease the marked black group.]
;B[dc]C[pto: This is nice move that takes one trouble away from black.]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[id];B[hc]C[I decided to sacrifice the stone at J15 for side territory.

pto: White is building huge central teritory and black crawls on third line.]
;W[hd];B[fg];W[hf];B[kg];W[jg];B[kh];W[jh]C[pto: This gave black some much needed strength and reduction at center. But he is still weak.]
;B[gf];W[ff];B[ge]SQ[fe][ff]C[I wanted to cut off these two stones.

pto: Why?];W[gg];B[gd];W[gc]C[Now I have been cut off.];B[gh]
;W[hg];B[fd];W[ed];B[ee];W[he];B[ef]C[Sacrifice the dead stones to secure more of the upper left side.

pto: One should avoid this kind of sacrifises. Allways keep you stones at goban, dead groups span into new life very easily. Upper right corner should stand just fine.]
;W[fh];B[eg];W[gi];B[eh];W[fi];B[ko];W[gm]C[pto: Too cautious and slow.]
;B[no];W[on];B[mn]C[I was happy to surround this stone.

pto: Yes, black finally gained some centrall influence and things are starting to look good.]
;W[ml]C[This isolates my center group.  It needs eyes.  I thought that I probably had one eye around M13 and just needed one more.]
;B[mj]LB[nk:A]C[pto: A is vital point. It tries to connect, and it makes eyespace.]
;W[pi];B[nk]C[pto: It doesn't work anymore.];W[ok]C[No chance for an eye at P10 anymore]
;B[oj];W[nl];B[kj];W[ji];B[ki]C[pto: Tengen might be an option here, black still has strong shape.]
;W[ch];B[jj]C[I wanted to reduce white's left center territory.

pto: Good, and this defends black group too.];W[ij];B[ol];W[om]
;B[nm];W[ok];B[gr];W[gq];B[ol];W[mm]C[pto: Dangerous ko threat for white, because ...]
;B[nn];W[ok];B[ej];W[ei];B[ol];W[qd]LB[qm:A]C[pto: ... now black can play A to make huge ko. And it would be flower viewing ko for black (nothing to lose in ko).]
;B[ok]TR[po][qo]C[pto: Event though I declared that marked black stones have lost all their aji, they still got it! Never remove your stones from goban!]
;W[qn]C[pto: This was allso caused by the weak ko threat by white. Now black can stop the ko with sente. Black has won the ko fight.]
;B[pc]SQ[ml][nl][mm]C[I win the ko and get to respond to all of white's threats.  Would K8 be better now?  I was assuming that the marked white stones are dead now.

pto: Dangerous assumption, but still I think connecting was good idea. Corners are allways big, and if white tries to escape with marked stones, black can follow into white territory.]
;W[rc];B[jm];W[jk];B[kk];W[jl];B[kl];W[im];B[di];W[dh];B[bg]
;W[dj];B[il];W[ik];B[in];W[hm];B[oh];W[me];B[lf]C[pto: This is not big.]
;W[ng];B[nh];W[jn]C[pto: This is big.];B[km];W[jo];B[kn]LB[jp:A]
C[pto: Black is strong (or white weak) enough for balck to play A.]
;W[jp];B[kp]LB[jq:A]C[pto: Perhaps A might be better, black seems strong enough.]
;W[jr];B[jq];W[iq];B[kr];W[ir]LB[jn:1][ir:2]C[pto: Sequence from 1 to 2 was about 15 to point for white.]
;B[rq]C[pto: This is big.];W[fs];B[es];W[bh];B[ah];W[ai];B[ag]
;W[bj];B[ec];W[cg]C[pto: Here white starts to play good yose moves.]
;B[bf];W[rb];B[qb];W[gb];B[ib];W[bn];B[co];W[do];B[cn];W[cm]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[eb];W[ao];B[bq];W[df];B[de];W[dg];B[ap];W[bs]
;B[ar]C[C1 looks better now since it connects all of black's corner stones and divides the eye space

pto: This lives too, but C1 would have been better (easier to count ;-)).]
;W[cs];B[dr];W[an];B[sq]LB[sp:A]C[pto: This move is gote in any case, so black could as well play A.]
;W[bd]C[This is where I lost the game.  I need to review the best way to defend my corner.  I still think that this invasion should not work, but it did.

proverb: There are possible things, impossible things, and things that happen. Sometimes things happen that were impossible. 

pto: I can't find a way to capture black, but some situations are a bit hairy.]
;B[ce]C[Playing this through now, C16 seems to be better here.  What do you recommend for this move?

pto: If black plays C16, white B15 still forces C15. I couldn't capture black though, so it might work. There are some ko fights and such involved so go ask some dan player.]
;W[bb]
(;B[ac]LB[cb:B][ac:A]C[Here, C17 seems better now.

pto: How about C18 for eyemaking.];W[bc];B[ab];W[cb];B[db]C[Now, B19 looks better.]
;W[be];B[ae];W[ad]
(;B[ba]LB[aa:B][ba:A]C[Now, A19 looks better.

pto: This is clear misplay, black gives white a beautifull tesuji. C19 would have taken the eyes. 

pto: With black A19, white can capture with sente and then start to take away black freedoms. Black has to wory about white eye and double ko. Playing C19 removes the double ko. Black should win.]
;W[ca];B[da];W[aa]C[Looking back now, I had several possibilites for saving this corner.

pto: True. I think you focused too much on white eyes. If you had made on eye for youself and throw one stone in to destroy invaders eyespace, result might have been better.

pto: Btw, this white move was misplay, white could play tenuki ;-)]
;B[qm]C[Now I am hoping that I can pull off a capture to offset my loss in the upper left corner.  I know I don't have a real chance, but neither did white in the upper left corner until he tried it.

pto: Would capturing this group be enough? Count the score.]
;W[pm];B[rm];W[rn];B[so];W[sp];B[sn];W[sm];B[sn];W[sk];B[qg]
;W[pg];B[ga];W[ha];B[hb];W[fa];C[Result: W+Resign

pto: So why this all happened? Well final reason was simple (???) life and death problem that black failed to solve (or white managed to solve). There is simple insurance policy available agains these situations - play that one gote move to defend. But even if that group was still alive, white would win!

pto: I recall that black groups were often thin. Solid moves in danger situations help. Think it as sitting still and looking around to see what is going on.  Sente is not allways what is needed; Weak cannot attack.

pto: And in yose, black played few times too solid moves ;-). With strength around, one can take more risks. But black played allso too thin moves in yose and lost several valuable points. I think that white got better result from yose.

pto: On strategic level I think black ignored white central influence too long. And sarcificed too many important reduction stones.]
