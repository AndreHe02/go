C[Hi any help with this game would be great there are several places that I had specific questions.  I did not play very well and made many mistakes.  I think I was ahead at one time but felt like I was behind the whole time.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[cf]LB[cj:B][eq:A][jd:C]C[I was not expecting this ogeima play and had a hard time figuring out how to answer.. didn't think A was good, thought about B but settled on C]

(;W[jc]C[This is a good move.];B[eq]C[Expected he would do this

This is also a good move by black, although the direct attack on k17 would be also good.]
;W[gq]LB[ep:A]C[Not sure if this was a good move, thought about A but didn't think it fit the situation so I tried a pincer

A is not a good move. Generaly, you should not touch the weak stone. Better to squeeze it. So G3 is ok. Anothe possibility is O17.]
;B[eo];W[cn]LB[dn:A]C[Also considered A.

I like to play A, but with C14m C6 might be preferable.];B[hp]
C[Okay this is where I need help, I see this all the time and not really sure how to respond to all the variations... I played around with this and found many better ways to respond but in this case I played absolutely miserable.  Would really like to leran this pattern better.]

C[black played good here];W[dd]C[Not sure if that was the next move black seemed to do okay and it was not as profitable as I thought it would be

White cannot destroy the groups of black in upper left corner. Just remove points, which is inadequate. Black destroyed lower left also som white groups.]

Black is weak there, White should attack.]

[he][ic][ie]C[Still they are not secure? Yes? But I am worried about the lower left corner so I went down there]
;W[cq]C[this move is ok - reinforcement plus e2 as local threat for connection, so c9 was not so good]
;B[dq]
(;W[cr]LB[dr:a][fs:b]C[Not sure if this was necessary, was expecting him to respond at a but he didn't so I lost sente wouldn't a white play at b need to be answered?

b is a big endgame move, but it is not urgent at the moment]
;B[nq];W[lq]C[Running out of time here so I just played several moves without thinking at all

M3 is a move into black sphere of influence. not good in general. White has now two weak groups. Q4 and M3.]

;B[oj];W[id]C[I was really lost here and felt like I was way behind and that the only chance I had of winning was killing something big like the group on the top, plus I thought that even if the white group lived I might be able to build a big moyo by attacking.  I know there are probably tons of other places to be playing, esp when I look at it now it seems like I was possibly ahead?]

It is too deep. You should jump on the line covering the area. Around p13 or O13 seems to be best.]

Not a very big capture. black J7 can be connected, hence the area is not big]

(;B[hk];W[hl];B[in];W[im];B[io];W[hm];B[hn];W[rn]C[Now I think I might be able to win this and am just realizing that blacks areas are not so big?

;B[rp]C[So here is the other big question here I knew I wanted to play there but was expecting black to answer my moves, keep sente and then go back and play there.  So when black plays inside can white live unconditionally.  I had trouble finding a way for white to live... maybe a Ko?  I think if I survive even in seki white can win? but...]

There is nothing in upper right, white does not have enough liberties. Similarly, upper center is ok.]
