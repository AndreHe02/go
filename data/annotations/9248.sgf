C[MR: Please find comments always starting with MR.

MR: The main topics of the game as commented for the black side are:
- Black allows white to build larger territories than black right from the beginning. So black is behind in territory and manouvres himself in a positiion in which he really has to kill one of the weak white groups.
- Black does not really attack hard although he is behind, he gives more room to white than necessary so that white can live easily everywhere. Moreover, he sometimes even allows white to live in sente.
- There are quite some moves in the middle of the board with no or only minor meaning (at least to my understanding) - althouth there is still unsettled territory left at the edges.]

(;B[pb]C[MR: This is a territory move. However, R11 and Q18 are miai for black. With the same argument that you wanted to end in sente in the upper left to continue in the lower right corner, you should take the opportunity to play in the upper left corner first.]

;W[jq];B[hq];W[mq]C[MR: White managed to establish a larger position in the upper left than black in the upper right, both sides have three other small groups, so white is already ahead.]

[qn][jq][mq]C[what is the best way to attack white weak groups ???
(LL)

MR: This is good for white. Before, black could have easily invaded at M17 to reduce the largest white territory. 
Black plays so that he needs to kill one of the weaker white groups in order to win the game.

To be honest, I am not good enough to know how to kill the white groups. But what I know is that black needs to attack forcefully as he is behind in territory.]
