RE[B+36.5]

C[Hi,

We are both interested in comments about our game. There are some comments during the game where we would like some feedback but we would also like to know about other positions we might have misjudged and some ideas (strategy, tactics) about improving our future games.

Thank you in advance.

---------------------

I will precede my comments with and "A:" so you will know it is me.

Andy];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[ce]C[Was it too defensive for the beginning of the game?

A: I don't believe so.  It is was, it is only at a level of analysis above my grade.  With a 3-4 stone opening, it is very hard to fault making the shimari.  You have 12-15 points of territory and a firm base to extend along both sides and to attack anything that gets close.]
;B[jc];W[mq];B[po];W[ip];B[cn];W[cl];B[en]
(;W[lc]C[Was it too close to k17? Should I have played somethimg like d11 or h16/h17?

A: It is a useful invasion which I can't fault at this stage, but it isn't where I would have moved.  Black has an invasion at C6 that he needs to rescue.  It probably can't be killed, but there is still a great deal to be gained by attacking it. See the variation starting with the previous move.]
;B[nc];W[hc];B[cj];W[ch]C[A: Things that are both pincers and extensions are good, so I have been told.  Secures white in the upper right and gets lots of territory.  This is why C15 was not too conservative.]
;B[fp]C[A: This is the danger in not following up E6 with F3 or F4]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[hq];B[eq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dn];W[gr];B[go]
C[A:  I cannot quite make out the reasoning of black's moves in this exchange.  White pretty much wins, I think, but I cannot make a case for some other series of moves.]
;W[fq];B[cq];W[le];B[je];W[pf];B[qh];W[rd]C[Was it too deep into the opponent's territory?]
;B[qc];W[od];B[qe];W[oc];B[qf];W[pc];B[qd]
(;W[qm]C[White has a nice lead here, consisting of the strong position in the upper left and along the bottom and the somewhat weaker group in the upper right.  White loses the game in part because this upper right group dies.  This invasion lives and reduces black's territory, but the stones would have been better used consolidating the group at the top and/or chasing black's two weak stones on the k column.  This is hindsight, of course, but I am a 10 kyu, so hindsight may have to do.

Black's tenuki shows that the invasion was not that compelling and that black was not counting on banking the entire right side anyway.  Black's move at D9 was the right idea, turning his loose position into the lower left into a single group and a source of strength and territory.

Check the variation for some possible better moves here.];B[dk]
C[I thought this was more important than playing q7 or r6.

A: I agree.];W[ql];B[qn];W[rk];B[qj];W[rj];B[ri];W[rn];B[ro]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[on];B[no];W[oo];B[op];W[np];B[mp];W[nq];B[mo]
;W[oq];B[pp];W[pr];B[qr];W[rq]C[Was it to soon? Perhaps I should have waited...
(maybe connected at p2 first)];B[or];W[nr];B[ps];W[rr]C[A: White's attack on the lower right was ill-conceived.  The invading group wasn't settled yet, but more important, the attack did not help settle it.  I don't thing the stones at S2 and S3 do anything useful, not with the cut at S7 available anyhow. In response to White's attack, black started a group at N7 that threatens to become very inconvenient.  The White invasion lives now only because Black later lets it live.  Instead of S3, put a stone at T7 and you have one eye.  A stone at P8 and you threaten to have two.  Then the White group can be a little pushy.]
;B[rm];W[sm];B[sn];W[sl]C[A: Now the White invasion is doomed, though it gets a reprieve later.  It might not have been the right thing to do, but had I been Black, I would have put some more effort into making darn sure it was dead.]
;B[pm]C[Maybe p8 should have been played by white instead of s2/s3]
;W[pl];B[om];W[nn];B[nm];W[mn];B[ok];W[lo];B[mm];W[lp]C[A: I take it back.  Black _does_ make sure it is dead, at least at this stage.  Black makes effective use of the aji of the N5 group, further killing the right side invasion and gaining central influence in exchange for White winning territory it should already own.]
;B[he]C[A: The coming exchange is dreadful for White, ruining a lot of territory in the upper left and donating a bunch of prisoners. D17 and H17 are not connected and F15 doesn't connect them.  Try F16 instead.  True, Black then has more central position and its stones are safer, but you still have a position in the upper right and left side from which to reduce it.  By the way, notice how the wall at N7, so far away, (subconsciously?) prompted White to sense that Black had too much power in the center and to overreach at F15 in compensation.]
;W[fe]C[Should I have played g15 or g16?];B[gd];W[id];B[jd]
C[A: There are times when you have to make an empty triangle, proverbs notwithstanding.  This isn't one of them.  Instead, connect out with, say, F18.]
;W[hd];B[gc];W[ge];B[ie]C[A: White simply fails to count liberties or identify a plan to save these stones.  Instead white keeps adding stones to the dead group and by the end Black has a dominant group established on top and white has no compensating influence for the fight.]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[ga];B[fa];W[ha];B[fb]C[A: Throughout this sequence, the threatened White group has had one less liberty than the threatened Black group.  I don't see the point of keeping up this fight.]
;W[ka]C[A:  I love monkey jumps and consider them anytime, although usually they are best done, or threatened, from established groups toward the endgame.  In this case, however, the deadness of the H19 group is immediate enough to make it not a viable monkey jump. Don't forget that monkey jumps rely for life on being to jump back to the launching point.  In this case however, that would result in the launching point losing even more liberty and dying quicker.

If, on the other hand, the idea was to use the aji of the dead group by threatening to connected to it and thereby strengthening the upper right group, it is a good idea, but much better executed at L18.]
;B[kb];W[jb]C[A: They're still dead and black is still getting bigger and stronger. Watch for the results of this loss later.]
;B[lb];W[mb];B[ib];W[kc];B[ja];W[mc];B[ep]C[I wanted to play it with the first occasion, just not to lose the e3 group. There might have been other bigger moves but this one had to be answered by white anyway.

A: You are right in both senses.  It was small (5 points maybe gained)  but it required an immediate response.  Of course, you are not in the endgame yet and you may want to leave things like that out there as ko threats.  Not a blunder by any means, but it is not clear to me that it was an optimum move.]
;W[er];B[oe];W[pe]C[i don't know why.... :(];B[of];W[pg];B[oh]
C[A: Excellent sequence from Black, game winning I think.  White ought perhaps to have sacrified Q14 and ataried instead from O15, allowing some extra eye space in conjunction with M15.  Meanwhile, I don't think White ever fully recovers or comes within striking distance again.  Clearly your comments indicate that White recognizes this.]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[pj];B[oj];W[ne];B[nf];W[mf];B[nd];W[md];B[mg]
;W[ng];B[og];W[lg];B[mh];W[gh]C[A: White ought now to have two eyes in the upper right.  Wouldn't it be swell to have a stone at L18 and an eye at M18 right about now.]
;B[fj]C[Is this to slow? Would g9 or g10 be better?

A: No, this is fine.  By now you should be in "winning the won game" mode.  Why make dramatic gestures?  Between the big positions you have at the top, left and right, White will have a hard time getting many points in the middle.  Meanwhile, you are 50 points ahead.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[fh];B[ej]C[A:This is a point at which White could hit O18 and once and for all settle the situation up there.  You could argue that just establishing the upper right is not enough to win the game, so White has to be bolder in the center.  I don't think, however, that C11 qualifies as such a move.]
;W[ci];B[bj]C[A:  This is an excellent use of a monkey jump move.  Maybe it should have been later, since the fight in the upper right ought to be top priority, so it is not sente.  But if it is not sente now, it will turn into either 10 points or sente later.]
;W[lm];B[ll];W[kl];B[lk];W[il];B[gl];W[hn];B[nb];W[ob];B[na]
;W[ma];B[me]C[A:  I am not one to recommend resigning much, but if White cannot rescue this situation, I would resign.]
;W[ol]C[A:  At first I faulted Black for the decision to ignore this ko threat, but the top side is much bigger and, once N14 is taken, is irretrievable.]
;B[lf]C[I decided no to play the ko and loose the n7 group. The white's upper groups looked bigger.]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[nl];B[rp];W[qq];B[sp];W[rl];B[rn];W[os];B[ns]
;W[ms];B[os];W[sq]C[A: White is very skillful in building this ko situation.  The trouble is that white is unable to win sufficient compensation through ko threats.]
;B[rs];W[ss];B[sr];W[oa];B[ne];W[ss];B[ls];W[qs];B[pr];W[mr]
;B[rs];W[ke];B[kf];W[qs];B[co]C[A: Black lacks ko threats big enough to dissuade White from taking the corner, but it is a two step ko, so he has a few chances.]
;W[qp]C[Probabily I should have chosen the seki, but I was way behind anyway...]
;B[rs];W[oi]C[A: This ko threat didn't work out.  The problem is, I can't see another one that gets White enough points to bother with.]
;B[sr];W[qi];B[pk];W[rh];B[pi];W[cr]C[A: The game is over.]
;B[eo];W[dr];B[cb]C[I think that was too far (given the aji stones at h19), maybe d18 would have been better.]

C[thanks for your time!

A: I believe it is Michael Redmond, 9p, who recommends reassessing the strength of each group of stones _every_ turn.  This was a relatively even game with lots of great back and forth, except that white let his group on the upper right die.  Looking at the board and thinking back, the invasion on the right lived and did damage, but nothing that could compensate for the loss up on top.  White's loyalty to dead groups is costly.  They should be used, cynically, for their aji to gain elsewhere.

I hope these comments are of some help.  I am not sure I am hugely better than either of you, but I hope some dispassionate analysis is valuable.]
