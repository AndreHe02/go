C[I was loosing this game until I found a good cutting point close to the end.

I've been working on protecting my groups and playing bigger moves.

I have several questions that I will ask during this game. However, if you see anything that you want to point out, please feel free to comment.


Hi flam,];B[pd]C[Betka [5k\]: hi
flam [6k\]: hi];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc]C[I've been playing the pincer here because a friend of mine recomended it. I feel that it either forces them to play in the corner or at r14. Is this correct?

M : This is correct. R17 is the standard answer, giving W solid points and B a nice wall facing Q10 but may be cut...
You don't have to pincer but it is a good idea. Q14 or even P15 are well-known follow-ups as well with a sanrensei (the opening with 3 stones on the stars of a side, as you did).]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[I never know what way to block from. I assume that this is right.

M : It is indeed. Please compare with the other variation to see where to problem would be. (See variation)]
;W[pc]
(;B[od]C[again. I'm not sure with this move either

M : This is the key point. You can recognize it as it spoils a tiger mouth (o17 Q17 then P16 would block B's development exactly the way it should be).]
;W[nb]
(;B[md]C[M : conceding an open tobi is something you can avoid. Keima N15 is better.]
(;W[qn]
(;B[np]C[I considered playing the pincer here too. Thoughts?

M : Yes. You already have a pincer, though a loose one (Q10). Killing white is out of question here but you can put pressure on the stone while blocking the corner in a direct way : R5.
R8 is nice because it makes it easier to attack the whole group, and R10 is a good move because it is very solid, though a little close to the wall.
All in all, R5 is considered better than O4 here.];W[rp];B[qq]
;W[ql];B[jq]
(;W[ed]C[I'm surprised that w hasn't played in my teritory yet. maybe r12 or something. q10 looks weak to me.


M : I know it's very hard to figure what playing high means. Mostly, you may consider this : if you play high openings (like the 3-star-opening that is so characteristic), you must forget everything you were told about sides and territory-oriented considerations. If you enjoy influence, you must develop attacking skills and accept that the opponent may take the 3rd line and make a solid area along the side, as long as you can reduce it efficiently.
Well I'm saying too much at once, because the cut o16 o15 P15 must be taken into account...

Anyway :
- Q10 is high so Q10 is not weak.
- B is everywhere so W should play a high move, not an invasion right now. E16 is big and high, so it's a very nice move (better, for instance, than R12. I'll argue about this).
- The R12 area is open along the side but W must take care about R8's life status.
- W o16 would spoil your shape.

To say it clearly, W can play E16 or engage a fight right now. See variations...]
;B[cj]C[M : as a conclusion to the variations i (kind of) built up, B needs an extra move like o16 (gote but very clean, no problem anymore with P16 or M17) or the sound move R10 (launching the sequence S3 S2 and a jump to the center like O7).]
;W[cn];B[cg];W[hc]
(;B[ie]C[this is sort of a new thing for me. I'm trying to expand my moyo.

A good idea. J16 or H15 also possible. (I like the shoulder hit J16 as it is a nice reducing move).
W should now add R10, attack the left group or invade deeply. You have a very nice influence, if you can add o16 you have very good prospects.]
;W[ri]C[M : Definitely an overplay...]
(;B[pm]C[This was a bad move for me

M : This is a bad move because you don't punish the overplay S11 with a clean, efficient cut. See variation.]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[om];B[ok];W[on];B[rj];W[rk];B[sj]C[M : R10 is still a potential cut you must take into account later. W lives.]
;W[lm]C[M : With M7 and a whole living group, I would target M3 as soon as possible. Defending with K5 would seem to be optimal next.
M4 would be more solid but too passive imho.]
(;B[gq]
(;W[eg];B[de]C[I'm also trying to play more forcing moves.

M : Forcing moves are good moves when they fulfill your goals without strengthening the opponent.
Here, in a way, you 'force' W to consolid a big territory chunk with D16 (although your opponent declined the invitation ^^).
Peeping at the tobi (playing a 'nozoki') can be nice if your peeping stone gives you support to be more solid, or makes the other chain harder to maneuver (spoiling eye shape especially).
Here, W should live easily in the corner and after the cut of the E13 stone, the latter is tough to chase because it lies in an open area. See variation.]
(;W[ee];B[dd];W[dc];B[ce];W[cc];B[ge];W[lq];B[po]C[this seems like a ways of a move for me. I don't know why I play these.]
;W[pn];B[rq]C[M : Well, this is not a good call, after M3 you have got to answer and maintain your continuity on the side (continuous frames are safer and don't spoil points in yose). This one is a very big endgame move but you can't just get cut without any contestation, you must disturb his plan :o)]

[ma][bd][ar][qj][sd][oc]C[here I was thinking of trying to reduce w's liberties and eventually kill the m6 group. didn't work though

M : W R10 gives W a sufficient sequence to enclose the eye space, so it's not at stake right now (see sequence).

Big yose moves are mostly border moves. If you can't see a kill, the best thing to do is rush to the biggest moves you can find, especially :
1/ sente moves where playing would be a sente for the opponent as well ('double sente'),
2/ sente moves (not necessarily sente as a local move for the opponent),
3/ spots where your opponent can play a sente (these are called reverse sente), though gote for you if you play it first,
4/ big gote moves.

This is not absolutely necessary to follow the 1-2-3-4 but it is usually the best way to find good yose moves. There are exceptions, of course (really huge gote moves may be more relevant than smaller double sente moves...).]

M : Depending on what W makes, yes, there are some combinations to use it in a creative way...
Note : I am assuming that not playing H7 doesn't let B's G6 group die (and it's the case : this group is ok : see the 'A19' variation, which is just a pure simulation of tenuki :o) ).
I thought a lot about it but I didn't find any seki or connection for F12 (W still has too many liberties), but it's tricky ! Especially because B E14 makes it plausible later to make use of a shortage of liberties.
I let some variations in the file. As W, if B plays D12 or D11 in an actual game, I would probably give up C11-C12 to get safety and easy connection.]

Thanks



Well, sorry if I didn't point out that many details, though I would give you some tips :
- Look at the edges and borders of the definite areas : if you play first on the edge of a common border, you will win a decisive race in a balanced game. (Playing F6 and G6 was missing a wonderful chance to surround a very big chunk of the board).
- You may fight more, especially if you play high openings because you will have more supports. You Must fight more when your main asset is at stake. You potentially lost the game when you didn't cut at M11. Don't forget : winning a game with a K.O. is also not bad, arguably better than waiting for the final counting process :o)
- Influence must be used for fighting. As long as you have something to chase, you can extend your chains while keeping the initiative (and that, my friend, means spontaneous drafting of territory if you choose the side correctly). Too bad I didn't see enough raw fighting sequences in this game to show you this, but you may experiment this idea in a couple of games : just forget about territory, keep chasing the weak groups (chasing and not killing) and make your opponent's invasions low and enclosed.

Feel free to send me an e-mail if any questions.

Enjoy the game !
Best regards, and maybe see you soon on KGS.

Of course, there are still possible cuts or threats but the cuts are not so easy to exploit. The main problem is often a threat like P14, offering support to a clean cut and giving a high stone in B's moyo (see example).

Anyway, please consider the Q10 stone. It faces no wall and doesn't cover the side, as W R14 is at worst a reduction of B's moyo.
If this is not clear enough, let's assume there is no black stone on Q10, . Would black rush to play it, or take initiative around a white corner ? 

W is solid on the right side, so this is not where the biggest moves are on the board, and B would have made a mistake investing a very early move playing Q10 instead of approaching a corner, for say.]
