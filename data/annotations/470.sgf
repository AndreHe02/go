Decision of resigning is meaningful at this point. It could be done when the invasion failed...

B now has around 140 points i think. This really an estimate not  a strict calculation. W has around 40-50. Mainly the left top.]
;W[nj];B[qh];W[nh];B[oi];W[oj];B[oh];W[mh];B[ln]C[W let B map out a large territory at the beginning of the game.
B was good at keeping sente at the beginning and this gave him the  chance to attack W with a pincer around bottom right and play
an approach to the upper left corner where White could not pincer
because of the K16 stone.

The mapping at the beginnig had in fact decided the winner...
The invasion of W at top was balanced by Blacks invasion on left. But  White could stop that invastion... But I think B would still be ahead
if that invasion had failed.?])
