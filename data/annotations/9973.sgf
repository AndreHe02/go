AB[gg][gc][cg]C[Hello. My name is Michail and I'll review this game. It is strange to review 3 handicaps 9x9 game - looks like black already won by having three corners to whites one. But still, I hope to point some mistakes. I included many varitions with possible continuations.]
;W[dd]
(;B[ed]LB[fe:a][ef:b][eb:c][be:d]C[Because all moves on 9x9 board are more or less local, one can say, that black is already attacking weak white stone right from moment, when that white stone touches board. So it would be wise to not attach to weak stone, but attack it from distance. Moves A to D surround gently and attack. Actually black can even play 3-3 right now - possible continuations are shown. But this black move is not end of the world by any means.]
;W[de]
(;B[df]TR[ed]LB[ee:a][ec:b][eg:c]C[This move is inducing white A, which hurts marked stones. You can strenghten marked stone with something like B. Then white would have moves against lower left, but nothing deadly (see variation). Also you can just play C and see, what white wants to do.]
;W[ee]
(;B[dc]LB[ec:a][fd:b]C[You are giving white forcing moves, better defend solidly A or B.]
;W[cc]
(;B[fe]LB[ec:a]C[Again, better protect solidly at A instead. Now there are to many cuts to take advantage of.]
;W[ef]
(;B[ff]C[Protect lower left, because even with many cuts, you should be able to get something with so many stones already in upper right (see var). If white gets one more move in lower left, however, it is very hart to live there.]
;W[eg]
(;B[eh]LB[dg:a][dh:b][ce:c]C[This again induces your opponent to split you with A or B. Maybe better to directly defend corner with B or C.]
;W[dh]
(;B[dg]LB[fh:a][ec:b]C[Hard to live with corner group now, better sacrifice it with A and protect B next.]

;W[id];B[tt]C[Some advices.
1) Don't attach to weak stones, because attachments strenghten both sides.
2) Hane (like black 6) creates cuts. Read out, how you would proceed, if opponent cuts you, before playing it.
3) When deciding which side to play (like move 10), try to read out, what would be most severe attack on stones, which you ignored by defending other side.

Hope, my review helped!])
