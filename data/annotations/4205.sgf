RE[W+13.50]
RU[Japanese]

C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  In my games, it seems as though no matter what I do, I fall badly behind early on.  This game is no exception; by about move 50 it seemed as though I had a bunch of weak groups and my opponent had no weaknesses to exploit.  I played to the bitter end only because I know from experience that I'm liable to estimate the score wrongly, and was surprised to find that I had lost by only about 15 points -- I thought I was much worse off than that.


Tero: As an overall comment, you should examine your groups eyepotential more carefully. You played a few moves to protect your groups, when they were not in danger. This gave your opponent sente for free. 

Hope my comments help,

Tero];B[pd];W[pq];B[cd];W[cp];B[ic]C[Ted: The Chinese fuseki.  My opponents always seem to get a nice moyo out of it.  I usually end up getting attacked, with terrible results for me.

Tero: I added a few of the most common approaches. The approach played in your game is also possible, but you should play move 11 as shown later.]

(;B[be]C[Tero: Here you played the normal variation for situations where black has nothing around J17.]
;W[gc];B[ie]C[Ted: I didn't like the idea of White trying to make the J17 stone weak; besides, this serves the purpose of closing White in at the top and making good shape with the stone at Q16.

Tero: As I showed before, this would be more effective if you had played B15 at B18. Still, this is ok.]
;W[cj]
(;B[ff]C[Ted: I didn't want to play around C12 because I figured I'd get hemmed in on the side; this way I should also be able to connect to the group at the top.

Tero: This seems very slow, your groups are not in immediate danger, so maybe it would be better to do something more active. See one possible line of play in variation.]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[he];B[id]C[Ted: I wonder if I should have played at H14 instead, but I was worried (rightly, as it later turned out) about playing in between the J17/J15 stones and the Q16 stone.]
;W[dm];B[qo]C[Ted: I didn't see how this could be a bad idea, if it was OK for White to approach at E16.  But when I try a similar approach I end up with a weak group.  Go figure.

Tero: This is not the same approach, to try the same as white did on the upper left corner, you should have played Q5. This is quite ok.]
;W[pl]C[Ted: It seems as though every time there's a pincer attack, I'm the one who ends up with a weak group.]

(;B[oo]C[Tero: Here you could have played differently, see variations.]
;W[nq];B[mo];W[qi];B[rq];W[lq];B[gq]C[Ted: I felt I couldn't afford to let White play here first and take the entire bottom of the board.  I felt this move also had the added benefit of confining White in on the bottom right.

What happens in the actual game, however, is that I end up with yet another weak group.]
;W[eq];B[jq];W[jo];B[kp];W[lp];B[nm]C[Ted: I didn't particularly like playing here, since I saw I was likely to end up weakining the stones on the other side, but it seemed urgent to play on the right and make certain that group got its two eyes.

Tero: This is a mistake. You have R2 and S7 or S8 to give you lots of eyespace. No need to defend yet. A move like M5 would have given some pressure on the white stones instead.]
;W[ko]
(;B[ip]C[Ted: I thought about splitting the White stones by playing M5, but concluded that that would leave my stones on the left much weaker.

Tero: M5 still seems like a good move to me. I continued your variation for a while...]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[ir]C[Ted: This was a move I didn't see coming at all.]

(;B[iq];W[jr];B[io];W[lo]C[Tero: Now white is connected and has a strong base on the bottom. Black on the other hand has only heavy stones at J4 with no eyes yet. See variation for move 41.]
;B[mn]C[Tero: This is too slow. Your group is safe, so maybe you should take a big point now, something like R14 for example. R14 would also put some pressure on the white R11 group.]
;W[pn];B[po];W[qf]
(;B[qd]C[Ted: I didn't want White playing in the corner, even though I knew fully well What was going to respond by trying to split my two groups.

I still don't see how alternative of playing around N17, and letting White take R17, is any better.

Tero: O17 would keep white really small in the corner, should he want to play there. Maybe white would rather play S16 instead of R17 in that situation.]
;W[ld];B[mc];W[nd]
(;B[md]C[Tero: maybe O17 would be better here. See variation.]
;W[od];B[pf]C[Ted: By this time, I felt like the game was a disaster.  It looks as though every one of my groups is weak, and White doesn't have any weaknesses that I can spot.

Should I have played N15 instead?

Tero: N15 would give white a connection around P14 too easily]
;W[nc];B[me];W[of];B[pg];W[qg];B[qe]C[Ted: I didn't like playing this move, but I can't let White take Q15 now.]

;W[lf];B[kd];W[nb];B[je]C[Ted: I wondered if I should have played N19 immediately.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[og];B[ph];W[nh];B[ma]C[Ted: I'd seen for a while that this was a fairly big move, but I felt that I first had to settle the group on the right.  Urgent moves before big moves!

Tero: Yes. actually this is an endgame move, maybe it was still too soon... Maybe S8 now would make R12 really nasty for white.]
;W[li];B[go]C[Ted: I didn't like playing here, since it felt small, but I looked at that group and felt I had to get eyes for it.  This creates one eye at least, and gives me a good opportunity to jump into the center to create a second eye.

Tero: also H2 should give you the second eye. See variation on move 87.]
;W[cg]
(;B[cf];W[hb];B[ib];W[qh]

Tero: S8 also possible for you. See variation.];W[rl];B[qm]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[kl];B[im]C[Ted: Time to work on another of my weak groups....

Tero: As I show earlier, you have H2 or jumping to center as options for J5 stones. So this is not required yet.]

Tero: This is quite ok. you get some points, and because of H2 there is no danger for you.]

;W[rf];B[sh];W[sg];B[rh];W[si];B[qr]C[Ted: Having realized my attempt to kill White's group on the right wasn't going to work, I play elsewhere.

;B[gd]C[Ted: I'm lucky to gain a few more points here....

Tero: This is 4 points in gote. H19 for example is atleast 4 points in sente. Also D1 3 points in sente and H2 is a few points in sure sente at this stage.]
