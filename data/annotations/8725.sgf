C[Hi Reb,

my name is RÃ¼diger, and I am the reviewer of your game I am currently playing around 7 to 8 kyu at KGS.

What I understand from your comments is, that you played white and that is was your first game against a human.

I did not understand what you mean with "I play the computer". Does it mean that you have a computer program against which you play?

I see from the game that your oponent sabaki claims to be a 5k, while you might be 30k or even lower. So my first comments:

1. The difference in strength is too big to have an enjoyable game. The difference in strenght should no be significant more than 9 levels. The rule of thumb is, that each level difference results in 1 handicap stone. So to follow that rule, your oponent should have given you about 25 handicap stones (30-5=25). So the game was on very uneven terms in favor of your oponent.

2. It is a rule, that the weaker oponent plays black, so again your oponent should have played white and you should have played black.

Now let us look into to played game.];B[pd]C[This is a normal starting move.

The normal development in the opening is:

1. place a stone in each corner
2. the expand to the sides

The played stone follows rule 1.];W[dp]C[Normal opening, no comment, also possible for white are Q4 or D16.
Nowadays it is quite common to play the 4-4 points D4, Q4, Q16 and D16 in the opening.
There are other possible moves in the corner, but I think a discussion of those would lead us too far from your game.]
;B[pq]SQ[pk][qk]C[Black plays a move in the other corner. He plans to play a so called chinese opening, by playing on one of the marked points in the future, which is a strong, territory oriented position.]
;W[cd]SQ[ec]C[Did you have a reason to play on C16? The move is ok, but as always, there should be some reasening behind yout moves. Do you know a possible continuation?

The move you played aims for a follow up move at the marked position, this would lead to a solid corner for white, and at the same time it would work well with your stone at D16.]
;B[ec]C[Black does not like the idea i plotted in the last move, so he plays here by himself.]
(;W[ed]C[Again, a rule of thumb:

an attaching move is not an attacking move, unleass you can immeditaly threaten to kill your oponents stones. Otherwise it will lead to a reaction of your oponent which will normally *strengthen* yur oponents stone. An attaching stone will lead to a settled situation, and is normally used for defense.

On my mind it would have been better for white to expand to the lower side, say to C13 with his move, giving is stones a stable and solid  base, as is shown in the variation of move 6.

This attachment will lead to a fight. With the difference of strenght of the players, white will perhaps make some error and loose the fight.]
;B[fd]C[Black goes in close combat.

I will show you a possible continuation in the variation.

As a golden rule: when attached, expand.]
(;W[dc]TR[ee]SQ[fc]C[In my feeling, this move is to narrow and still leaves weaknesses. Black might force at E15 and then connect at F17.]
;B[ee]SQ[dd]C[As expected. White should now connect at D16. Black than has to connect at F17. A possible continuation is shown in the varation.]
(;W[de]CR[cc][ce]TR[fc][fe]SQ[ed]C[I think this move is an error. Black will connect at either F17 or E15 and continue the fight. The stone at E16 is in atari, and when black captures it, white has more weaknesses at C17 and C15]
;B[dd]CR[cc][ce]C[Black even feels that he might trick you somehow. White should now defend at C17 or C15.]
;W[pf]C[But white decides to open a new front, while the old front is still not yet settled and unstable. This is not a sound strategy.]
;B[ed]C[Black secures at E16 and is happy.];W[ef]C[White even more unstabilizes his group, having now weaknesses at D14, C15 and D17. The odds are agains white noe here.

White should have defended at C15 or C17.];B[ce]CR[de]C[Black gives atari to D15.

When white defends at D15, black will play at C17 giving double atari to C16 and D17. This will lead to black win the corner and having a white group whithout eyespace floating in the center.]
;W[df];B[be]C[Black tests whites abilities to fight. The Odds are for black. I f white connects at C17. the there will starte a race for liberties.

Who is in the better position for this race?. Lets make a varation and look at it.]
(;W[pp]LB[pi:A][cm:C][po:D][qp:E][gq:B]TR[dm][cn][dn]SQ[fp]
[gp][fq]C[White leaves the hopeless position in the upper left corner and starts a new front.

A better idea is to stabilze existing stones, moving at Q11 (A), G3 (B) or around that or at C7 (C) or around that. 

Also a move at Q5 (D) is possible, but I personally would prefer Q11 (A).

The move at Q4 agains leads to close combat and is not appropriate for this phase of the game.

A calm and secure continuation of black would be at R4 (E). Lets see what happens.]
;B[cc]C[Black ignores, and settles the upper corner. White should not answer here but strenghten his other stones.]
;W[bd]C[An old amerian indian proverb is: Do not try to ride a dead horse! The white stones are dead and will stay dead.

A very important aspect of Go ist, that you need to anicipate what might be the next move of your oponent, and what will be the resulting situation. This is called "reading" the board.

Try to read at least 2 moves ahead, this will prevent you of many bad moves.

Professional players can read *many* moves ahead, I can only esrimate, surely around 20 moves with all possible variations, of course their experience also will help them to discard bad varations soon.]
;B[bc]C[Dead stays dead.];W[ad]C[even more dead. Whites stones will have no more than 2 liberties, what ever white tries. Black will probably move elsewhere as this position here (in the upper left corner)  is now settled in favor of black.]
;B[ae]C[Will white add another dead stone?]
(;W[cf]C[Relieve, no, but it would be better to play at Q11, around G3 or around C7.

If white likes to play in the top, i think a stone at D12 or D11 would be better. Compare the positions in the variations.]
;B[ph]TR[nf]C[Black ignores and now severly attacks the stone at Q14.

Note again: attacking is *not* done by attaching, but by keeping some distance to the attacked stones.

The goal of Go is not to destroy the oponent, but to gain advantage from his weakness.

While *must* now run into free space, best by jumping to O14.]
;W[oh]C[This answer ist not bad by itself, but it will lead again to close combat. Black is better in close combat as shown in the upper left corner.

But it is a possible, defensive move, the goal of white must be to create a stronger position for his stones in this area.]
;B[oi]TR[og][nh]C[Rule: when attached, then extend. Black thinks he might ignote this proverb, but white should follow: Extending to P13 or Q12.

Blacks intension is to build a some strong stones with influence toward the lower side to again attack more strongly the white stone at Q4!]
;W[og]C[Good.];B[pi];W[ni]TR[nd]C[I would have played at 16, attacking the black corner.]
;B[nj]TR[nh][mi]C[Black bends again. Intension is to build a strong wall influencing to the lower part of the board. White should either connect at O11 or extend to N11.

I would prefer N11.];W[nk]C[White is splitting his forces all by himself. This is a bad move. White is creating a new weak small group for white, not connected to the rest of his stones.]
;B[mj]TR[pf][og][oh][ni]SQ[nk]C[Black will not allow the groups to connect. The stones marked triangle are now in danger.
The stone marked square is all alone and has no friends around.

Looks not good for white.];W[lj]SQ[nd]C[the 3rd lonely stone for white. 

Better is O16, attacking the black stone at Q16, and with help of this attack the white stone probably can stabilize and live.]
;B[ok]TR[pf][og][oh][ni]C[Black protects his weakness at Q10 first, before he continues the attack to the white group marked triangle.]
;W[mi];B[mk]TR[lh]C[This is apreparation move for an other attack, best would be ti sacrifice O9 and secure the large center group with M12.]
;W[nl]C[Dont follow your oponent in every move, you do not have to answer his moves, first think whether there is a more important or more promising move elsewhere.]
;B[li]C[Black cuts, whites center stones are not yet settled, when trying to settle those, black will gain more in the center, probably catching white M10.]
;W[pj]C[The 4th lonely week stone for white, after back has connected it is as good as dead.]
;B[oj];W[pk]C[Black stones 5 liberties, white stones Q10-Q11 ; 3 liberties, who will win?]
;B[pl]C[No real chance for the white stones at Q10-Q11, as they have no friends in reach.]
;W[ki]TR[lh][nh]C[Pay attention this is a pattern you must see and recognise in future.

When black escapes to M12, it threatens O12, catching the 2 white stones. This is a common pattern any you need to see this immediatly in future.

Now, when white defends at O12, white has a defect at L10, which black can use to catch either M10 or L11. Please look at the variation.]
;B[lh]TR[nh]
(;W[kh]TR[nh]C[Black can now play at O12. Black is secure, white has a lot of weak groups or lonely stones.]
;B[nh];W[mh]TR[de][cf][df][ef][kg][lg]C[Dont ride a dead horse., Better is white M13, forcing black to take the 2 white stones, White could then connect at L13. After that the wite stones marked square woulld fit nicely together.

By the way, white stones marked with circle are now extremly weak, and also as good as dead.

Black will now play N13, taking 3 white stones off the board.]
;B[mg]LB[df:1][og:2][kh:3][nk:4][pk:5][dp:7][pp:6]C[Until now, I see 2 living black groups with territory and even some prisoners.

I count 7 unconnected and weak groups of white.

White has not combinded his forces but instead has started a new war every minute without finishing the previous ones.]
;W[oq]C[Yes, this is the first serious attack which white launches.]
;B[op]C[A crosscut by black.

If it goes right, every party will gain a bit, if one party makes an error, he will loose everything.]
;W[pr]C[Not wrong, do you know continuations?];B[qq]C[Standard move, extend.]
;W[np]C[This means, black, take the right side, I, white  go for the left side. Do not expect to crush the opponent. let him live, but let him live small!]
;B[oo]C[Black accespts, white should now defend it defects at O3 and P2 by playing at either O3 or P2 or O2!.]
;W[qp]C[Wrong! 
Your play is inconsistent. 
You try to destroy your oponent which will lead to your destruction!]
;B[or]C[Black utilizes whites weakness.];W[nq];B[rp]C[Black offers you to have the lower side when you give him the right side. This is the course of the came in the next moves.]
;W[qr]C[atari, black needs to connect at S3.];B[rq]C[Now the black stone at P2 is caucht by white, white has a small lower side and some influence to the left, working well with the stone at D4.

Black as a big sized right side, the 2 white stones at Q4-R4 are caught and dead.]
;W[po]TR[pp][qp]SQ[qo]C[Again you are riding dead horses.

I have some kore general remark, what you played here is a well know, extremly bad form of stones. Please remember and avoid if ever possible (In about 999 of 1000 cases there is a better move). The form is called empty triangle, and I have marked it with a triangle.

The empty part of the triangle I have maked with a square.

This form of stones os bad because it is very inefficient. It are 3 stones which have on 7 liberties.
In the position of the board, already 5 of that 7 liberties are occupied by black. So with the next move, black can give atari to the 3 marked stones, and white will *never* have a chance to save those stones. This can easily seen by reading the next moves in advance, and ther is pratical no variation in the sequence, so it is easy to see in advance.

Black will atari at Q6.];B[pn]C[As expected. If white answers at R5, black can continue atari at R6 or S5.]
;W[qo]C[You like to ride dead horses, do you?. Has any of those moved with your tries?]
;B[qn]C[Black continues its atari.];W[ro]C[Black can give atari at S6 or T5.]
;B[rn]C[Expected.];W[so]C[2 liberties, and no chance to get more, the board is at its end.]
;B[sn]C[atari, black will not allow white to fiddle around.]
;W[sq]C[atary is atari. black even does not need to answer this move and can play elsewhere.

Playing elsewhere is what white should have done.

Also white can play at S2 and possibly save his stone at P2 if white makes an error.]
;B[rr];W[rs]CR[rp][pq][qq][rq][rr]LB[ps:1][qs:2][ss:3]C[The black stones marked with circle have 2 liberties, it is blacks move.

Black can play 1, giving atari to 2 white stones.
If white connects at 2, black can take out 3 white stones with a move at 3.

Let me say, white has crushed himself here.

T3 was a very bad move.];B[ck]TR[de][cf][df][ef]SQ[dp]C[But black thinks that this gain is not as big and plays elsewhere, looking for bigger opportunities.

Weakening the white stones marked triangle and weaking the lone white stone marked with square.

White should have moved to support those stones a long time ago.

For white to save his stones at the bottom a move at O2 is now *urgent*!

An other golden role of Go comes here:

First do urgent moves, then do big moves.

Urgent moves are those which save the life of an endangered group.]
;W[ss]LB[sr:3][ps:1][qs:2]C[Th white move at T1 is bad, as it does not prevent the sequence of capturing which I have shown you before.

Imagine (read) black 1 at Q1, giving atari to 2 white stones.
Whites attempt to save  at 2 which puts 4 white stones into self atari, so that 5 stones can be captured with black 3.]
;B[ps]C[As expected];W[qs]C[dead];B[sr]CR[dp]TR[de][cf][df]
[ef]C[Please defend either triangle or circle!];W[nr]C[The white move changes nothing to the situation in the right lower corner. It is useless and black needs not to answer, so he can play elsewhere.]
;B[fq]CR[dp]C[Black uses his freedom to severly attack the white stone marked with circle.]
;W[on]SQ[no]C[Again a white move of no use. black will happily move out to O5, keeping the white stones separated.
With O5 black even manages to reduce the liberties of a white group by one, making it a nice future attacking target.]
;B[sp]C[Black is gracious and takes out the dead stones. allowing white to rethink his strategy.

Please note, when white tries to connect with O5, black can cut with O6.]
;W[no];B[iq]C[But black goes for a bigger target. J3 stabilizes immeditly the stones F3 and J3, attacking for death all the white stones right of it, as they have very few possibilities now for future eyes.]
;W[os]C[The withe move is a self atari.];B[ns]C[Black can kill immediatly.]
;W[ms]C[balck will connect at P1, leaving a white weakness at N2.]
;B[cn]C[No, black thinks the stone at O1 is just one stone, I can gain more by playing on the left side.

Even when white D4 survies the double attack it faces now, black has made some good profit of territory.]
;W[os]C[Well not black can connect at Q1, or even ignore and play elsewhere, the black group to the right is not in danger.]
;B[cq]C[Much bigger.];W[pr]CR[no][np][nq][oq][nr][ms][os]LB[mr:3]
[or:2][ns:1]C[Me as black would now play R1. The white stones marked circle have at most a single aye at 1 if white connects at 2, with a weakness at 3.]
;B[ff]C[But black decides to go for an other prey.];W[gf]C[Bad move, where have you learned this?

Bad move means it is bad here, it might be useful in an other situation, if you know how to continue.

The key to Go is to anticipate moves, the moves of the oponent and the own moves.]
;B[fg]C[black keeps white forces seperated and white can not do anyting agains it, a result of the bad move G14.]
;W[af]LB[ac:1][bf:2]C[There are white stones in atari, which black will now capture at 1. Whites position is not strenghtend by this move, even when white contines afterwards with B14 (2).]
;B[ac];W[dk]C[Put another weak lonely white fighter beside a black stone who has friends nearby?]
;B[dh]C[Black first firmly keeps the white stones in the cage.]
;W[eg]C[How was that old american indian proverb about riding dead horses?]
;B[eh]C[Black says: You can not pass!];W[fh]C[A new lonely stone not having a good connection to the other stones, it will also be doomed.]
;B[bh]C[Me as black would move at G13, as the white stones are already captured.]
;W[gg]C[black will connect at F15.];B[fe];W[di]CR[de][cf][df]
[ef][eg]SQ[dh][eh]C[Me as black would move out at E11. Black can not save the stones marked with circle. They have 3 liberties, black stones square have 3 liberties too, but black has the move.]
;B[ci]C[Black secures this way.];W[ei]C[black does not need to answer at C12, he can cut at F11 or G12.]
;B[gh]C[one of the cuts.];W[fi]C[black must extend to G12 to have a fighting position.]
;B[hh]CR[fh][di][ei][fi][dk][fk]SQ[gf][gg]C[white has allowed again to black to seperate the white forces.

Whites best move might be around F9 to try to get eyes whith his group marked circle.

Fighting with the group marked square might end in desaster.]
;W[gi]LB[hg:B][ig:C][hi:A]TR[gh][hh]C[black has options  to move at H11, H13 or J13. In all cases he will get along with his stones marked triangle and kill a white group.]
;B[if]C[Black is even more aggressive.];W[hi]C[Black has many options to move and needs not to fear, white is not attacking here, white is fighting for its own life.]
;B[ih];W[ie]CR[gf][gg]C[Bad move, not helping the to white stones. the black has many countermoves. My play would be H15, but black chooses an other option.]
;B[hf]C[Whites stones have 2 liberties, they are dead with out helping friends. J15 is *not* helping.]
;W[ii]C[This move is not creating eyes for the white group. Though it has a lot of possibilities in the direction away to the bottom, perpedicular to the white wall.]
;B[kg]C[Black connects his forces, now claiming a huge black top area with some future white prisoners in it.]
;W[ji]C[white connects forces but does not yet have eyes and is *not* claiming a big territory.]
;B[dl]C[black claimes onow the left side as his territory with this move, he also starts to attack the huge white group which does not yet have eyes.]
;W[dj]C[This is *not*  creating eyes for his group. A white extension to E8 might erase possible eye space for white.

White is in high danger now.];B[cl]C[black is gracious.];W[cj]
TR[fh][kh][di][ei][fi][gi][hi][ii][ji][ki][dj][lj][dk]C[Sorry, white has no plan and does not see the danger. 

The white move at C10 is a bad move. it does not create an eye for the marked group.

The white group marked with triangle has not yet eyes. White tries to attack with a dead warrior!]
;B[bj]C[Black is gracious, he thinks "I have enough, I do not need to take risks".]
;W[ai]C[After the black answerat B10, the white stone at A10 has 2 liberties left and is dead.]
;B[bi];W[cg]C[After the black answer at C12, the black groups are connected and has many liberties, the white group has 3 liberties and is still dead.]
;B[ch];W[aj]C[After the white move at A9, the white stones can be killed, whatever white does.]
;B[nc]C[But black decides to better secure his huge top area.]
;W[bl]C[after the black answer at B9, black has many liberties, and the white stones can be killed with a move at either B9 or B7.]
;B[bm]C[Or just at B7.];W[cm]C[white plays self atari. it seems white has an outright death wish!]
;B[dm]C[blacks postion has been strengthened by whites bad move.]

[ao:1]C[stones with 2 liberties stay dead when hey have no supporting friends nearby. Black can play A2, if white plays A7 (which he should not do) black takes out with A8.

It also works for black when he decides to play at A7 first. then white A7, black A4.]

But remember, you need 2 eyes to live.];B[kl]CR[lj]SQ[il]C[I think a move at K9 would have been better for black.

Anyway, this is an attempt to erase eye space for the hugw white group.
