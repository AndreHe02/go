C[Hello,

Let me introduce the key points in this review:
1. You were maybe impressed by your opponent's rating (it's not always real strength) - many of your moves were just to defend somewhere, but still you couldn't defend everywhere. Instead, create positions where you don't need to defend anymore, and be the first who attacks.
2. Consider the balance between low and high stones (on 3 and 4-5 lines, respectively). Low stones are better at taking territory, but high stones are more useful at fighting, reducing centre's potential, invading somewhere - they make difference. Don't hesitate to invent them in your games.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[cn];W[de];B[fq]LB[dg:A]C[I read once that answering to a kakari on a hoshi is more important than one on a komoku. I'm not sure to fully understand why so I'm boldly applying and see what will happen.

AlGebr: Well, I think this choice can't be done only because you 'read once', since it highly depends on your own knowledge and confidence about different variations. On the other hand, you can always choose the variation you know to get a good position or choose the opposite to gain more practice.

I consider that all your stones are low now. To avoid this, I would try a high pincer at A.]
;W[eo];B[cq];W[fd]C[AlGebr: Still, all of your stones are on the 3rd line, and all White stones are high. That's how I (generally) explain why it was easier for White in this game to attack your stones and make profit from it.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[dd]C[no other choice here, white wants to fight so let's fight a 3d]

AlGebr: Yes, you are right.];W[hc];B[fb];W[jc];B[ib];W[je];B[cp]
LB[dl:A]TR[ce][cf][cg][bh][ch][ci]C[AlGebr: This black stone always has two even opportunities to connect, while the marked group doesn't. So I prefer A here.]
;W[cl];B[ej];W[el];B[gj];W[gl];B[fg]LB[gj:1][gl:2]C[not sure about this move, what white do if I jump once more ? I thought about d3 now too but I feared white would have made too much center thickness by harrassing my weak group.

AlGebr: Since this move doesn't hurt your other groups and doesn't strengthen White, I think it's good. I guess that if you made it without 1-2 excange, it would be even better.]
;W[oc];B[qg];W[jb];B[ab];W[ad];B[fc];W[dq]C[this is huge, should have played it earlier...]

(;B[kq]LB[hq:A][iq:B][nq:C]C[ I thought about approaching the hoshi stone but couldn't decide how because of e5/g8 so I let white choose which side he prefers

AlGebr: The bottom-right corner may become big, taking on left with A or B is small and insecure - so I agree with White's choice here. To prevent this predictable continuation, I would try to approach White's corner on C, while it is alone and thus not so strong, and then make sure that White's territory, made on left by capturing F3 stone, isn't that big.]

(;B[dr];W[gq];B[fr];W[gp];B[ko]LB[hr:A]C[AlGebr: All in all, I am not sure if your stones in the centre will be useful. Connecting at A is simpler.]
;W[hq]
(;B[ip]C[AlGebr: I see that by this move you're trying to hold White in a shape that you can attack later. On the other hand, you may just jump towards the center (as you planned one move before) - see the variation.]
;W[iq];B[jq];W[qo];B[qm]C[ not sure again here, I first thought about safer r10 here but I'll still be behind if white take another big point. So I come far, if white invade, fighting between r7 and invading stone can help me building strength to attack white left group. If not, I'll be happy to take q10.

AlGebr: I see that your plans are dispersing now. White's R5 is big, so I think we can't catch him up on points if we make them only along the 3rd line. Instead, I prefer to take H6 now and see how White's group feels under attack - this is urgent, because both groups are weak.]
;W[mo]C[chevelu: 71 : I know l3 group is more urgent but I want to learn from a 3d how to attack that]
;B[pj];W[ho];B[io];W[hn];B[jm];W[dm];B[pc];W[od];B[gf]C[AlGebr: I didn't get the idea of this move.Before it, E13 didn't work for White due to your F14 - but later White destroyed some your points with it, that was hurting.

I'll try Q15 now - reducing White's potential on top and preventing his invasions on left at the same time is big.]
;W[qh]
(;B[ph]C[chevelu: 81 : thought about q13 too

AlGebr: I think White still can live here and thus destroy a lot of territory. When the only task is defence, I prefer R11.]

AlGebr: I'd like also to start with S6 here, because it's sente for both sides. K13 is possibly big, but it's not sente.]
