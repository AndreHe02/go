C[Hello!

My name is Tim, or Talaer on KGS. I played Black in the game and was not very satisfied with my result. I've looked over the game myself, but can't figure out where I got so far behind.

I will include comments during main stages of the game so that you can see what I was thinking. Hopefully this will help you with your review.

Thanks for your help!
Tim

Dakre: Hello ;) just to summarize what i have seen now... the most important things for you are concentration... the ko fight probably has made you loose the game and that was just a mind twist... nothing serious... it was not your misunderstanding of go it was just a second of being unconcentrated... it is difficult to keep the concentration for a whole game but this of course doesn't only affect this ko fight but all... your whole game...
two other things i want to point out are a slip in the opening where you had the possibility to close white in and maybe a bit life and death to improve your reading... this was very important when you were invading whites territory... there was more possible than a  ko fight... and you almost saw it... ;) your opening and positional judgement are already quite good i think. you may improve in the endgame but that may be not as valuable as to try to concentrate and doing more life and death ;)

best wishes, Dakre aka Alexander Probst];B[qd]C[thorsten [12k\]: hi]
;W[cp]C[Talaer [12k?\]: Hello! have fun];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[eq]
C[Dakre: up to here it's a game without any flaws :> even pro's play this fuseki... but now for the next move ;)]
;B[qj]LB[ce:A][po:B]C[Dakre: you're right in thinking that an extension from a shimari is big, BUT a basic proverb says: first corners then sides, then center. And there are still two open corners.
You may think there are fusekis like the chinese and so on and you're of course alright that you shouldn't follow this proverb blindly, but in this case these two corners are even more urgent because both are on the 3-4 which is unsymmetrically (in contrast to a 4-4 or 3-3). To play at unsymmetrical corners is even more urgent. So i think in this case it would be better to approach at A or close your own corner at B.
At least i would play a line higher on q10. This would be better for the development of a moyo. If the lower right corner is white it would have been better to play low like here on the third line.]
;W[cf];B[jp];W[cj];B[jd];W[hc];B[jj]LB[po:A]C[I do not like openings that start in this manner, but I felt after just these few moves that I have a slight advantage.

Dakre: yes i agree and i feel the same way. I don't like big moyo games, because i usually don't really know where to play... but especially then you should play this fuseki often ;)
Instead of the last Black move i'd rather play at q5. Even when white plays tengen then, your moyo is bigger. But your move seems good as well.]
;W[qo]LB[pl:A]C[Opponent invades, I want to develop the upper moyo with an attack, so I use pincer.

Looking back, I think maybe I should have tried a high pincer around Q8. My choice seems to have given me a low position.

Dakre: i like the low princer you played];B[qm];W[qq];B[qr]
;W[pp]
(;B[oq]C[Is this submissive? Should I play S3 and dare White to start a ko?

Dakre:That would be a possibility... look at the variation]

(;B[pn];W[po]
(;B[no]MA[po][pn]LB[nm:A]C[Dakre: after you played q6, white p5 gets stronger... now white could lean on o6... but imagine not having made the exchange of the marked stones... maybe it would have been better to play at A now instead of this move...]
;W[rr]C[Dakre: GREAT mistake by white!!!! remember this... these are essential, because i think they're easy to grasp....

white must walk out into the center with 'a'... no other move... as long as you can escape to the center you don't have to live at the side... especially not when your opponent has the possibility to close you in with one more move...
being closed in is a pitty...]
(;B[pr]LB[on:A]C[Dakre: and a big mistake by black... black should close white in with a... look at the moyo... look at the strength of your stones if you had played there... a beautiful wall...

this move instead is a small endgame-move... maybe about 8 points, but gote... not appropriate even though the opening is over and we're in middlegame...

try to remember this... these things are more important than the opening, which is more intuitive, in my oppinion.]
;W[iq]C[Dakre: still white should escape at p6...];B[qg]C[Dakre: and still black should close white in... ;)

but not only this... r13 is making bad shape... if you want to play here, why not a line higher at q13?
but in this case it is more urgent to play at k3 i think... it makes your group save and white needs a follow up. then you can choose to play tenuki.]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[lq]LB[mp:A]
(;B[lp]LB[mp:A]C[Dakre: how about playing at a instead? if white pushes through and cuts it doesn't work...]

Talaer [12k?\]: I was just stupid]

(;B[mp];W[nq];B[np];W[on]C[Now I have a weak group and my opponent is pressing into my moyo. No good.

Dakre: yes, very right ;)];B[nj]C[I risk tenuki to try and create a more solid framework.

Dakre: yes, good idea not playing near white when you need to connect... make a bigger circle round the enemy...]

;W[ii];B[hi]LB[gj:A][jj:B]C[Dakre: this one is not so good, i think. pushing from behind is always dangerous... try as early as you can to get ahead of your opponent... maybe you could have played at 'a'?

now you push white near your stone at 'b' which makes it very weak and ineffective...]
;W[ij];B[hj];W[ik];B[hk];W[hl];B[il];W[jl];B[im];W[kj]C[I thought by containing his group inside my moyo that I would be able to either kill it or generate large profit. However, the result seems that he was able to live (or nearly live) quite easily and I'm left with little.

Dakre: at least you have a wall facing whites territory... that should make an invasion an easy enterprise ;)]

I feel my only hope is to manage another invasion. This plan does not succeed. =P

Dakre: you did well in the endgame... the lead of white decreased... if you had not played o6 you would have made another 8 points... ;) so a small additional thing and you may have won... not to mention the disaster of your lost ko... ;)
