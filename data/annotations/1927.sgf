AB[pd][dp]C[hello there james.  hope you find the comments valuable.  my main advice would be to try to maintain a view of the bigger picture, which is often done in a handicap game by only responding to white's moves if they are urgent - if not, look around and take a big point.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nc];B[ic]C[although this is not unplayable, it is a little unusual.  also you may get forced into an overconcentrated position (see variation)]

(;W[kc]C[white should play Q18 first - he's trying to trick you!]
;B[fc]C[this works because of how white has played - see variation]

(;W[ne];B[pg]C[too far - should be at Q14 to avoid a weakness to potential invasion...]

(;W[pb];B[qc];W[oe]C[but if white plays as badly as this, it ends up in the correct spot!]
;B[pe];W[dj]LB[dg:A]TR[dj]C[Q: could I have made a move in between these two white stones at A?

A: yes, but then you would be missing the big points.  you were correct to defend top right as you did - now you should answer by taking a big point yourself, possibly after playing D18 to stabilise the top left]

(;B[dm]C[this is small - this stone should be around K4, possibly R9, all after the D18,C17 exchange]
;W[jq]C[white grabs another big point];B[pl]TR[pl]C[Q: was this extension too big?

A: no, this is an excellent grand scale move, and works well together with the earlier D7 move.  by doing this, you are putting pressure on the K3 stone - not to live, which it will do easily, but to have any lasting influence.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[bad - you're giving white the ideal formation (3 point extension from 2 stone wall) and your corner is not yet secure. see variation from previous move - don't be afraid to give white the corner if you can make his outside stones weak.]
;W[fp];B[nq]C[again, this does not secure the corner, and does not put pressure on white.  M3 would have been move adventurous - white cannot really invade between it and the lower right corner since then he'll have two weak groups]

(;W[cf]C[small move by white - he should be invading your corners at this point - see previous variation]

(;B[ee]C[this group isn't stable yet - better would be the D18,C17 exchange then F15]
;W[dh];B[de]C[by doing this you are making white stronger, but without getting anything in return]
;W[ce];B[ed];W[dc];B[ec]C[horrid - go and wash your mouth out :-)  a classic empty triangle!!]
;W[eo];B[do];W[en];B[em]C[better to do D6 first - white gets good forcing moves against you once he pushes through now]
;W[dn];B[cn];W[cl];B[cm];W[gn];B[fm]C[this move achieves little.  try to think on a bigger scale - this lower left corner is now secure - a play somewhere around M7 would map out a nice moyo for you and keeps up the pressure on white]
;W[mp]C[oh, white got there first...];B[mq];W[lq]
(;B[lr]C[no need for this move - a straight cut at M4 would be better - see variation off previous move]
;W[kr];B[mr];W[lp];B[np];W[no];B[oo];W[nn];B[on];W[nm]C[white has squashed you up, expanded his territory and escaped into the centre.  not nice for black!]
;B[nk]C[excellent - this is the kind of move you should be looking for right from the beginning.]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[og];B[oi]C[try not to automatically answer every white move - here for example, white has missed the plot, which is with your weak group top left.  you should answer P12 with something like K16 or J14, depending on how you feel.]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[of];B[oc];W[ob];B[qb];W[pc];B[qd];W[ni];B[oj]
;W[jd]C[white got there first because you answered every move of his from P12  onwards!]
;B[id];W[ie];B[he];W[if];B[hf];W[ig];B[lk]C[tough decision - now that white has been allowed to strengthen his top right group, you need some presence in the centre, but allowing H13 is painful.  an alternative might have been G12]
;W[om];B[pm];W[hg];B[gg];W[gh];B[fg];W[fh];B[eg];W[eh];B[dg]
;W[cg];B[jk];W[gm]
(;B[fl]C[horrible empty triangle again.  try to rid your game of them!  you can extend to F10 without much problem here (see variation)]
;W[gl];B[fk];W[gk];B[fj];W[ei]
(;B[gj]C[these groups don't need to link - they're already both strong.  how about using your nice new wall for a quick invasion at B10]
;W[hj];B[bl]C[one further possible at B9];W[ck];B[bk];W[bj]

(;B[bm]C[why?  you have sente, these stones are not threatened!  get a big point like E18 (let's not talk about that empty triangle you made earlier).  see the variation off the previous move.]
;W[er];B[dr];W[ep];B[dq];W[fr]C[now you have sente again you should be after those endgame points again - E18 and K18 are still open.  all the stuff in the middle should become neutral territory, and besides which the endgame moves are sente, so you can play them and *then* come back to the middle]

C[oops there goes another one...];B[fb];W[db];B[jb]C[hurrah - good play]
;W[jc];B[ib];W[kb]C[rather than playing N11, get the sente move at L19 in first - see variation for why it's sente]

(;B[mi];W[mh];B[nj];W[nh];B[li];W[lh];B[kj];W[qq]TR[qq]C[Q: white tries to make life and eventually succeeds... should I have defended this area sooner or is there a way to break white's making of two eyes?

A: this is a fun one.  you should be able to kill it :-)  you need to block as the variation to restrict white's space]

(;B[pr]C[nope - block at R4 first - this gives white too much space to work with]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro]C[if you don't think you can kill him, at least make him live small, so R6 would be good here]

(;B[qr];W[qn]C[ouch - by blocking on the wrong side, and not containing him, white is now eating your territory!]
