C[I lost this game, by 33.5 moku (believe it or not it was quite close), I played black, and I'm a 26k according to KGS ratings. Thank your for reviewing this game ^_^

--Serenity

W: It was a close game, if your bottom right group had lived you probably would have won.  There are a few concepts that you should work on, but overall you played a good game and just need to keep practicing :)

All my comments will be preceded by W:];B[od];W[ld];B[qp];W[pg]
;B[qe];W[qj];B[nq];W[jp]C[A question: why did he go after the sides instead of the corners?

W: You'll have to ask him that :)  The general recommendation is to go for corners before sides, because it's easier to secure territory in those areas.  He must have had a different strategy in mind, or maybe he just felt like trying something new.]
;B[fp];W[ed];B[do]C[Question: Was I over concentrated?

W: Not at all.  You have 3 fairly strong groups in 3 different parts of the board, while your opponent has several weak targets that you can attack.

However, note that none of your corners are secure territory, as you see later on in the game.]
;W[hn];B[dl];W[dg];B[gd];W[ie];B[id];W[hd];B[hc];W[he];B[gc]
;W[ic];B[ec];W[dc]
(;B[fc]C[W: Very bad move, does nothing but reduce your liberties.  If you're worried about being cut, there are stronger ways to play.  See the variation.]
;W[dd];B[qm]C[W: This is a good move, but this is not the time to play it.  Your G17 group is in danger, it's important to fortify it before playing elsewhere.  Luckily, your opponent didn't decide to attack it.]
;W[ol];B[ei]C[W: What were you trying to do with this move?  It's not a bad move, but make sure you understand that it doesn't help to make territory.  I assume you were trying to prevent your opponent from making too much center territory?]

(;W[di]C[W: In general it's not good to attach directly to enemy stones because you make the enemy stronger.  This can be seen here, as your opponent allows you to develop a very strong group in the center.  Your opponent could've played this one line lower and it would've been much better, see the variation.]
;B[ej];W[eh];B[fh];W[gg];B[gh];W[ih];B[eg]
(;W[fg]C[W: Bad move for white, he just gave up a LOT of territory to you on the left side.  Better to connect at D12 here, his move doesn't really accomplish anything.  See the variation.]
;B[dh]C[W: White just let you take a lot of territory on the left.]
;W[lh];B[hj];W[gq];B[fq];W[gp];B[kq];W[lp];B[lq];W[mq];B[mp]
;W[mn];B[hl]C[W: You should probably reinforce your bottom right, by playing at O4.  This would secure your corner and make your entire bottom right group safe.  Reinforcing a group may not always be the best move, but it is almost always a good move.]
;W[jl];B[jj];W[kj];B[mc];W[me];B[of];W[qc]TR[oc][qd]C[I completely missed that...I thought the horse-move oppening is supposed to protect against corner invasions?

W: The keima (horse-move) does protect against corner invasions.  However, you used the wrong keima to protect the corner :)  The keima that protects a corner with 2 moves has stones on the 3-4 and 5-3 points (marked with triangles)]
;B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[qf]
(;B[rd]C[W: This sequence turned out badly, in part due to this move.  Not only did white live, but he managed to connect to his right side group.  In the future, if you're not 100% certain that you can kill a group, don't go for the kill.  Instead, try to seal it in and/or gain some outside profit.  See the variation for one possibility.]

;W[oj];B[nj];W[nk];B[mj];W[lk];B[mk];W[ml];B[oo];W[rl];B[rm]
C[I also didn't notice that the lower right was in danger :/

W: It's actually fairly safe, the reason you had problems is that you ignored a ko threat.]
;W[ql];B[jc];W[jd];B[kc];W[lc];B[lb];W[kb];B[jb];W[mb];B[ka]
;W[nc];B[ib];W[ch];B[ci];W[eh];B[dj];W[ef]
(;B[cj]C[W: A little too defensive.  Because you're very strong in the area, you can play a bit more aggressively. See the variations for two possibilities.]
;W[fe];B[gn];W[go];B[fo];W[cq]C[Question: Same mistake here...Is playing at 2-2 usually a neccesary or a good procedure?

W: Not sure what you mean about playing at 2-2.  It's difficult kill this invasion because he has a fairly large space to live in, so instead try to make him live small.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[er]C[W: This is where you try to kill white, and end up failing.  In the game you managed to kill him anyway because of a ko fight, but you lost a lot by ignoring his ko threat.  Again, unless you're 100% certain that you can kill him, just try to make him live small, and make territory and strengthen yourself.

Playing B3 here would make some territory and keep his group very small.]
;W[bp];B[dr]C[W: Still going for the kill, at the cost of much of your territory.]
;W[co];B[dp];W[cr];B[cn];W[bo];B[bq];W[br];B[ao];W[an];B[bn]
;W[ap];B[am];W[np]C[I only managed to kill it because he made several mistakes...]
;B[ar];W[aq];B[cs];W[bs];B[ao]C[W: He could have lived here by simply capturing at A1.  However, he ended up making a lot more profit by playing a ko threat that you ignored.  You should have played in the bottom right here to solidify your group.  You ended up losing just about all of it, which cost you the game.]
;W[mo];B[bq];W[oq]LB[pr:A]C[W: At this point you need to give up on your L3 stones, and try to salvage what you can in the corner.  The safest move is Q2 (A), which secures your bottom right group and threatens to save at least the O3 stone.]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[jq];W[qq]
(;B[rp]C[W: There is a proverb in go, "Attach, hane."  It means that when your opponent attaches directly to a stone, you should (in many cases, but not all) hane.  This is especially applicable here, see the variation.]

;W[bg];B[bh];W[cg];B[ge];W[pn];B[qn]C[I had no idea this area was this weak...]
;W[po];B[qo]C[W: This move is what caused your group to die.  It does nothing to help you increase your eyespace.  The only move in this situation is S3.]
;W[rq]C[W: Your group is now dead.

No more comments, the rest is endgame and you did fine there.]

[es][fs][gs][hs][is]C[W: Overall you played a good game.  The main things to work on:

1. Corners:  You need to learn the correct keima (knight's move) that secures a corner.
2. Invasions:  Don't always try to kill the invading group.  In fact, in most cases don't go for the kill, as if you try to kill a group and fail, you usually end up with a poor result.
3. Fighting:  During fights you made a few slack moves that did nothing to help you or hurt your opponent.  Try to make sure that each move you play has a purpose.  Don't worry, this will come with time, just keep practicing :)

Again, nice game, I think you would have had it if your bottom right group hadn't died.]
)
(;B[rq]C[W: This is the hane.  You still need to work a little to ensure that your bottom right group gets 2 eyes, but your group is in much better shape than before.]
))
(;B[bi];W[bh]C[W: This way gains a few points in sente.  The white cut at C10 does not work.]
)
(;B[bh];W[bi];B[dh]C[W: A fairly big ko, you'd have to make sure you have enough ko threats before playing this way.]
))
(;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[qa];W[ra];B[pa];W[sb];B[rg]C[W: White lives very small, your group becomes strong, and you break into his right side territory.  This is a reasonable result.]
;W[rf];B[sf];W[rh]))
(;W[dh];B[fg];W[ck]C[W: Look at how white now has a lot of territory on the left side, and black has an open skirt (white can jump into black's territory from his C9 stone).  Even without playing C9, the result is still much better for white than in the actual game.]
))
(;W[ci]C[W: This is a much better move.  It makes territory for white while strengthening his upper left group, prevents black from making some territory, and threatens to further reduce blacks territory prospects on the left by jumping in even farther.  It also strengthens white in the area and he could potentially cut off the E11 stone.]
))
(;B[eb];W[db];B[ib];W[jc];B[fd]C[W: Here's one variation where you live easily and are still not completely sealed in.]
