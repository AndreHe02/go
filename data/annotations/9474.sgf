C[I play black in this game, it was very back-and-forth.  I thought I was ahead in the opening, but white won a big fight on top, then I captured a huge group on the right side, and white retaliated by capturing my other corner.  In the end I won by 3.5 without komi, which was just enough, but it wouldn't have been if this were an even game.

Thanks for reviewing!

Dieter: Hi Tom. You know me from Sensei's. I'm only a few stones stronger, if at all (KGS 1d these days) so if you prefer sending this to another reviewer too, I won't be offended at all. Let me still shed my light on this game and what you could learn from it.

The story of this game: 
In the opening White made an unorthodox claim on a central sphere of influence, then overplayed in the area you were supposed to control. This led to two major fights. At the top he manufactured a ko, which was heavy for you, because the stability of your surrounding stones was at stake. He took it and you took compensation at the bottom right. Unfortunately, the chase on his group ended with its connection to the outside and his group became part of the borders of a large central moyo. At this point the game was very bad for you because you got no compensation for the loss at the top.

Fortunately he overlooked the threat to his second eye later on, you killed it and the game was reversed. Still White used all the aji of it to capture the upper right, in a larger fashion than he should have. In the end you still won by a close margin.

The commentary and most important variations will hence be focused on these main events:

59: what happens if we ignore White's first kothreat
73, 79: more severe ways to get our deserved compensation
99: a more active way to play with the weakened top group
167, 175: ways to reduce or avoid the loss of the top right

What lessons can you draw from this:
- when to start a ko, when to answer a ko threat: take some time before plunging into the ko
- avoid pushing through small gaps (see SL)
- under time pressure, play basic instinct (see SL)];B[pd];W[dp]

;B[hp];W[in];B[pj]C[I could be wrong, but I feel like black has the better position in this fuseki.

(;B[ko]C[Dieter: but this is wrong.];W[kn];B[jo];W[jn]C[Dieter: the influence now obtained by White is strong and the two black stones have a lack of liberties, so there is aji in this position.]

;W[mc];B[lc];W[oc];B[pc];W[og]C[I thought for a while about what to do here.  Maybe I am too greedy, but it really feels like I should be able to kill these white stones.  In the end I decided my highest priority was keeping the corner and side connected, which also denies white a base.

Dieter: not sure if you should kill them, but the attack should indeed bring you great profit.]
;B[qg];W[lb];B[kb];W[nb];B[pb]C[Leaving the cut aji is dangerous, but I didn't want white to get easy life.  Also there's bad aji for white to exploit in the N13 group.

Dieter: I think you're keeping the pressure up in the best of ways.]

(;B[la]C[This was actually a big mistake, I think I could've just descended.

Dieter: this is a turning point. I'm afraid I'd have played the ko too but you are right that in this position, the ko is too heavy for Black. You have hardly any threats against him so you need to ignore his first threat.]

(;B[mq]C[Dieter: let's see what happens if we ignore];W[lb]
;B[ln]C[Dieter: probably the best threat];W[ka]C[I think given the local ko threats maybe white should've responded

;W[rm]
(;B[sn]C[I go for the kill move, but in retrospect maybe I should've just protected and moved on.

Dieter: . If White lives here, it's too easy. You need to chase him out and destroy his moyo in the process, or even kill him altogether. You've lost a major ko and need to go for compensation, if possible.]
;W[pl];B[qk];W[nl]
(;B[pm]C[Dieter: I thought you should surround but the group is difficult to kill. A stronger player might see the way.]

;W[lk]SQ[mk][kl]C[Dieter: the last moves pushed White through "small gaps", reducing your own liberties.]
;B[li]C[This strengthens white once more];W[ki];B[lh]C[So white escapes, but black can chase profitably into white's moyo.  Black still has about 30 points on the bottom and maybe 20-25 in the upper right.  White probably has 60+ points in the left, so I need to resurrect thestones on top and steal some corner points.]
;W[jk];B[kh];W[ji]C[Dieter: at this point the group that was supposed to be chased has become part of the moyo border. In my opinion the game is now very favourable for White, moreover since Black is weak at the top.]

(;B[kc]C[In retrospect I think this was a mistake. I could've just captured with L14, but I thought maybe I could get away with this and pressure the white group to make eyes in gote somehow.

Dieter: the white group is alive. But merely connecting at L14 is too slow. So I understand you played here. See var for a more active solution.]
;W[hc];B[ib];W[ic];B[jc];W[ja];B[hb];W[hd];B[gb]C[I start byo-yomi.  That means I averaged about 11 seconds per move.  Even in these fast games I should play slower.]
