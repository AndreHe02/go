;B[pd]C[[wallace\] Hi, I'll try to answer all of your questions, and more...
If you still feel uncertain about some points, please don't hesitate to ask me :)]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[ip];B[cn];W[eo];B[cq];W[dq]C[[wallace\] Not very good for White: when B connects, J4 seems too close to the wall W can build.]
;B[bp]TR[cp]C[[wallace\] Usually at the marked spot, C4, which allows D5(threatening the cut at E4), but ok.]
;W[nq];B[qn]C[[wallace\] It's a detail, but playing high, at R6, would make invading (around M3) or building on the right side easier...]
;W[pr];B[mq]C[Next time, I'd play R3, and ... F17. Is it better ?

[wallace\] Yes R3 seems fine. N3 leads to very complicated variations (starting with a W answer at N4...) and since W is not weak in the corner (R3 is still open) nor on the side (J4 already there), I'm not sure it's a good idea for B...]

(;W[qq]C[[wallace\] B is probably happy with this quiet anwser]
;B[np];W[oq];B[mp];W[op];B[oo];W[gp]TR[nc][qi][no]C[[wallace\] very slow from W, there's no urge there. Cutting, invading or approaching is possible.]
;B[jq];W[iq];B[ir]TR[df][qi]C[[wallace\] This is an endgame move...
Approaching the upper left (breaking the shicho) or extending from the wall is bigger.]
;W[hr];B[jr]C[[wallace\] B lost the initiative :(];W[qf];B[qh]
TR[qi]C[[wallace\] I'd have pincered a little farther (for better balance with the wall) but good direction.]
;W[of];B[nd]
(;W[rd]C[[wallace\] Not so big... better flatten B (see var).]
;B[qc]TR[oh]C[[wallace\] Building a big belly is bigger, since B O16-Q16 can escape towards the upper edge.]
;W[rg]
(;B[qp]C[I tenukied because I wasnt sure how to answer S13, but regretted it later :o(
I wondered about bS12 wP12, bP12 wS12 and bS11 or bR10. How to play ?
Maybe the pincer was too close (should be around R11) ?

[wallace\] I agree with the last comment :)
however answering was better, see vars. Moreover R4 is quite small since it doesn't threaten to kill W.

S11 or S12 (if you can handle the fight) are ok.];W[rh];B[fc]
;W[lc];B[me];W[oc];B[od];W[nc];B[jc];W[hc]C[[wallace\] W is overplaying a bit (3 groups on the top border!)]
;B[fe];W[df];B[id]C[[wallace\] Very good, B seems in control of the top side.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[ge];B[ff];W[hf];B[jf];W[jb]C[Ouch ! Seems to me that black has no way to keep white separate.

[wallace\] too bad, B can cut (see vars) that's why J16 is good.]

(;B[kc];W[kb];B[ld];W[mc];B[db];W[cc];B[ch]C[[wallace\] too agressive since F14 is not safe yet.]
;W[cb];B[dc];W[ce]C[[wallace\] if W simply around E13 B in trouble]
;B[fh];W[dh];B[ci];W[ck];B[di];W[qj];B[mr];W[rq];B[rp];W[sp]
;B[so];W[sq];B[rn];W[nr]TR[dl]C[[wallace\] all this sequence was endgame...

Trying to capture C9 would be much bigger.];B[cr];W[ic]C[[wallace\] useless?]
;B[kd]TR[em]C[[wallace\] still small. Now that C2 was left unanswered, B can launch a splitting attack on C9 and E5.]
;W[dr];B[mg];W[nh];B[bf];W[be];B[cf];W[dg];B[em]TR[ej][fj]C[[wallace\] good idea :) but D13 threatens a cut at F13, E12 or E11...
A move arond E10 or F10  seems necessary.];W[ei]C[[wallace\] ouch...]
;B[eh];W[ej];B[dj]TR[gj]C[[wallace\] direction and shape are dubious: empty triangle is bad (lack of liberties), and you still have cut *or* B9 miai...
Moreover the other group is bigger];W[dk];B[ek];W[fk];B[el]
;W[gi]C[[wallace\] Now, even if B can capture C9, the big dragon at F17 is in danger]
;B[gh];W[bj];B[bi];W[bg];B[cg];W[bm];B[bn];W[af];B[bl];W[ai]
C[[wallace\] Well, B gets captured, but even if both D10 and F15 group had lived, I think that B is behind.

As a matter of fact, B didn't map much territory in this game:
- in the lower right B built a wall, but gave up the wall's extension;
- on the top side, B attacked but couldn't punish W's overplay;
- on the left B played too agressively (C12 was overplay as long as the F14 group was weak) and couldn't win the fight...

The problems I saw were:
- B played too many endgame moves quite early, and thus lost the initiative;
- B was not confident enough in his own strategic choices, thus gave up R12 extension and K17 splitting of W;
- finally, B didn't evaluate properly the relative weakness of groups (which is quite common) and thus never managed to really attack W (neither Right top, nor top, nor bottom left, ...).

What I would advise is too try to be more obstinate in some choices (of course one must be flexible, but one must also be consistent in one's strategy), even without being sure of how things will turn out.
I'd also say that it's important to re-assess frequently the status of groups.
And finally, try not to play moves on the second line, except when trying to live/kill... or at the end of the game.

Good luck, and don't hesitate if you have more questions.])
