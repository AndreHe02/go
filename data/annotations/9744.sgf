H: Black could have had better];W[fr]C[was this necessary? - was i threatening f2?]

(;B[co]C[was this too small?
H: This was unnecessary to connect your stones.  Black ends gote, and white gets to take the next big point.]
;W[cf];B[ic]C[this seemed to me bigger than left side

H: Yes, this is the right area.];W[gc]C[H: A and B are miai points.  However forcing white to take B will leave white slightly overconcentrated (discussed earlier).]

(;B[pc]C[H: This strengthens white and hurts your weak stone.]
;W[ob];B[ld];W[kc]C[H: Weak point in this shape.  White can do this because of how strong white is everywhere on top.]
;B[mc]C[H: If you can't profitably attack white's three stones, avoid this move.]
;W[jd];B[od];W[mb];B[nd];W[pb];B[qb];W[lc];B[mp]C[going for moyo

H: It will be very hard for black already; whites territory is cash and black has a large, still-open moyo.]

(;W[mr]C[H: Mistake.];B[pj]C[which he lets me get];W[ql]C[this looks unreasonable - how should i attack it

H: It's not so unreasonable.  White has two escape routes.]

H: This is a mistake, indeed.];W[ki];B[jj];W[ji];B[ii];W[kj]
;B[kk];W[lj]C[oh dear - looks like i messed up and i'm in trouble unless i can win a liberty race but maybe he can get two eyes?]
;B[sk];W[mj]
(;B[ch]C[i tenuki because i can either make two eyes or escape to middle. But connecting out is at least reverse sente if not actual sente so i'm not sure about my logic

H: This leaves white a good sequence at A, leading to more white cash, and a moyo with easy invasions still for black.]

(;W[rg]C[H: White offers a chance.]
(;B[df];W[de];B[dg]
(;W[ee]C[H: White is gote and black has a promising moyo, this way.]

(;B[ie]C[k3 immediately instead but this is big too

H: This is a mistake.];W[id];B[jc];W[hd];B[lb]C[wrong choice - i think o18 is better]
;W[kb];B[nb];W[la]C[H: Black hasn't gained anything from j15 yet.]
;B[nr]C[wrong because i can gain points with sente at the top with o19]
;W[mq];B[ce]C[misread but he believed me];W[cd];B[be];W[bd]
;B[bf]C[he now has sente but aren't i ahead and should win from here??

thereason i'm ahead is his unreasonable invasions allowing me to gain thickness on outside??]

;W[qa];B[ph];W[pi];B[qb];W[si]C[this is suspicious but seems valid beacuse i too have shortage of liberties - can't read it out so i believe it as a threat]
;B[sj];W[qa];B[qi];W[oh];B[qb];W[nq];B[sb]C[i had a few more threats so should i continue the ko? this didn't look enormous though

H: It's a nice gift after a hard game.  I recommend: 
Reviewing some joseki for 3,4.  The northeast corner should have been better for black.
Reading The Direction of Play by Kajiwara.  Black ended up playing fairly passively overall, and could have got much more benefit by playing actively in this game.]
