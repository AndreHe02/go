C[This is a game I played as black against an equally strong opponent on KGS. I was lucky to win by 0.5 points in the end, but at several places I had doubts wheather I was applying the right strategy. For some reason I feel like I could have made more out of this game.

Thank you very much for your help!

GP: Hi, I'm Graham Philips (topazg) a British 1k and KGS 1d. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can, though White here is likely to make plays way over my head :)
I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf.];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jc];W[cf]
(;B[fc]C[I'm not so sure about this one; with K17, should I have pincered at C12? Or played high at F16?

GP: You are right that with K17 low, this is too low and flat. Both of your proposed options are reasonable (see variations)]
;W[dj];B[jq]TR[qn][fq][nq]C[GP: Approaching at the triangled points is also very playable. White may be tempted to play O3 here - now Black cannot get a good extension along the bottom on that side and would choose G3 immediately. This helps secure some points for White in the bottom right without leaving the weaknesses that M3 left.]
;W[lq];B[fq]C[Here maybe G3 would have been better?

GP: Yes, this is asking for complications! At the very least White will defend the corner leaving Black an awkward weak point that is too gote to defend against. White can also just play H3 now...]
;W[cn]C[GP: A sensible choice.];B[dr];W[hq]
(;B[hp]C[GP: You might want to consider F5, leaving miai of H4 and C3. K3 is a solitary stone, and connection isn't crucial quite yet.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[gp];B[gq];W[ho];B[hr]C[GP: This sequence is a bit of a disaster for Black. White has gained a strong and useful shape on the top side of the fight, facing the center, that Black cannot easily touch, and White can return now to defending the corner with C3. Connecting here next by White was a big mistake - it's not outright bad, but for this stage in the game it is simply small and far far too slow.]
;W[hp];B[cq]C[GP: Good response, this is where White should have played last move. White's gained some very useful influence, and Black's territory isn't great, but the wH4 bC3 exchange has kept things approximately even I think.]
;W[jp]
(;B[qj]C[GP: Good decision not to respond. There are a lot of weaknesses around K3, but you can't patch them up without either a) ending in gote, or b) making White even thicker.

I think you have too strong a habit of taking low side points. I would be tempted to approach the bottom left and then pull back high, as White really needs to respond to the approach and you get a more intimidating position (see variation).]
;W[qf];B[nc]C[GP: Again, this should be high, it's just more threatening and K17 really reduces any top side aji that White might want to exploit.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[nb];W[oc];B[od]
;W[qb];B[pf];W[ql]
(;B[qn]C[Was this too greedy? Should I have tried to seal up some territory by playing P10? But this in turn would have given white the chance to make huge claims by playing P8...

GP: P10  feels slow to me, but it is solid and makes a follow up somewhere around tengen quite tempting. White cannot respond P8 because you invade the 3-3 (see variation), but White could simply play R4 and get a very large corner. I'd be tempted simply to invade at R3 instead of this, but this is also reasonable to me, you leave yourself with a few acceptable options.]

(;W[pl];B[qq]
(;W[qp]C[GP: White's better off pushing the other side, because of his thickness at the bottom.]
;B[pq];W[oq]
(;B[op]C[GP: Overplay (see variations) :)]
(;W[nq];B[rp];W[oo];B[qo];W[np];B[oj]C[I felt like I got a better result in the corner than I could have hoped for.

GP: You got an excellent result, and in sente. This is a good point to take, the two White stones are still not safe.]
;W[pi]
(;B[pj]C[Better to play R11?

GP: _Always_ connect against the peep unless you have really good reasons read out not to (see variation)]
;W[ni];B[oi]C[GP: Good. O10 is also an option, but this is most likely better.]
;W[oh]
(;B[ph]C[GP: Don't panic! White's thin and weak, your group isn't in danger, just extend at O10 and keep White thin and weak.

White's just playing for thickness here. The whole game plan for White now _has_ to be the centre as that's all that's left for White to take. He needs enough points to negate what you've picked up in the corners and at the top. He needs to use all that thickness in the lower right and bottom to generate a huge moyo. Don't let him get around the outside.

Both O12 and O10 are playable,.];W[nj];B[nh]C[GP: Again, too small, now White gets to happily finish his wall]
;W[mh];B[ng];W[nk]C[GP: This is a really good result for White again. It's annoying to concede territory on the right like this, but the central moyo is becoming game deciding.]
;B[ij]C[Was this premature? Should I have played N13 first?

GP: N13 will strengthen White further, although you'll get some profit. This may have been premature, as White should cap and start the fight immediately.

The key in this game was not to respond to wN13 :)]
(;W[mg]
(;B[nf]C[GP: You've given White a bit of extra support to kill your middle by responding here.]
;W[ig];B[im];W[km];B[gm]C[GP: I would prefer G10, as White is strong down here. The idea is good, but it will be hard not to become heavy now.]
;W[gk];B[hl];W[hc]C[GP: A crazy time to tenuki! White should just get that middle group of Black's dead.]
;B[ie]C[GP: This is loose. If you want to kill H17, play J16. If you don't want to play J16 and risk giving Black a thick wall because of your middle group, ignore this move and save the middle group. If you don't want to play in the middle because of risks to the corner, play C16 first giving aji at C12 before deciding between the top and the middle. This move doesn't really achieve anything solidly.]
;W[he];B[ih]C[GP: Why play J15 exchange simply to play down here now. If you think a bad response by White to this J12 move gives you the ability to push through by playing J15, play this move first and save J15 for the mistake. Now, White can pick his response more carefully.]
;W[hg]
(;B[jl]C[GP: Too slow, if you want to make groups like this live, play light contact plays. L8 is more interesting than this, as eyespace is too easy to squeeze out, G10 is also playable. Now you have H8 in place.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb];W[ef];B[fe];W[ff];B[gd]
(;W[ge];B[hd];W[hh]C[I guess white did a pretty good job here attacking my upper left group and the center at the same time. Any way I could have resisted? Or was I jumping in too far in the first place?

GP: The points White have gained on the left are big, but White really needs to kill this group now he's chosen to sacrifice H17. wH16 instead of G15 would have been very interesting and complicated.

The jump in was a bit too deep, responding to N13 was simply very small, and that cost you the biggest chance to make the reduction work well.]
;B[kj];W[kl];B[kk];W[hk];B[ik];W[fl];B[jm];W[kn];B[fm];W[em]
;B[cp];W[co];B[mf];W[kq];B[jr]C[GP: This really is just bad shape. L2 or tenuki :) L2 is much bigger for White now than it should be. The cuts at J2 and G2 don't work.]
;W[jf];B[je];W[kf];B[ke];W[lf];B[le];W[na];B[ma];W[oa];B[lb]
;W[ee];B[ms];W[ed];B[ec];W[fd];B[gc];W[se];B[rf]C[GP: T14 is fine, and if you are going to end in gote anyway you may as well close off the territory properly.]
;W[rk]
(;B[el]C[This turned out to be a failure - anythin that could have been done about the huge white territory on the left? Or was it too late already?

GP: It's really too late now. Once White got in the big moves in the top left and blocked with E7 and H12, the left hand side is all territory. Better to simply reduce than to make invasions that don't work.]
;W[ek];B[dl];W[dm];B[cl];W[bj];B[bm];W[bp];B[bq];W[ao]C[GP: Should be E5 here, which would have prevented you getting that stone. You cannot take B4 in sente.]
;B[fp];W[fo];B[eo];W[cm];B[do];W[ck];B[bl];W[bn];B[rj];W[bk]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[fj]C[Another failure...

GP: Indeed :) All of these cost you points. Don't play assuming your opponent won't see the obvious. F9 would also have worked as a response for White. Far better to take a point on the outside in sente that threatens a move that nearly works, than to play a move that nearly works but doesn't :)]
;W[gj];B[ce]C[GP: It's ugly, but C16 is the better move here. It lets you play A17 in sente instead of White getting A18 in sente, and it doesn't let White play C16 to capture this stone if Black tenukis after wB15.]

;W[aq]C[Probably I should have anwered here, but as white had already wasted one move to reduce my liberties, I thought the ko wasn't so profitable any more.

GP: No, but if you take the ko, capturing at B5 is a massive massive threat (see variation).]

[fs][hs][qs][rs][ss]C[GP: Your yose was generally pretty good, and congratulations on the win :)

I feel you were quite lucky in the middle, but you managed to make everything important live, and got some useful reduction moves in to hold the win. The invasion was slightly deep, but because of the sequence on the right you'd given White such a large potential moyo you had to play dangerously I think - you only won by 0.5 points as it was!

*** Important points to take from the game ***

* Opening: You have a real tendency to take 3rd line points in the opening, both as responses to corner approaches and as edge moves. By doing lots of these you ended up with unreasonably "flat" positions.

* Fight globally: A few times you really underestimated the value of access to the center. Attaching at H4 instead of jumping to F5 was the first sign that you were willing to give White a lot of central facing thickness. After the bottom corner sequence (which _was_ a good way to play locally, and netted you a good result), the urgency of minimising that center became very important. Instead, you allowed White to get a sequence on the right edge that gave white another big wall of thickness in exchange for giving you 15 points of territory in an area you were already strong.

* Don't be frightened in a weak group fight: After w58 at P12 you had a position where both Black and White were unsettled. In the game you took a very passive route to settle on the edge, and gave White some really powerful thickness. Always ask yourself if you can get away with ignoring this. By simply pushing towards the middle, you can guarantee keeping the White group weaker than the Black group, and eventually it will be White panicking to settle. Black will simply settle because of being a stronger group, and is likely to be able to destroy the middle moyo in the process. Again, this is part of the global fight idea. Remember after you pushed at P11 you left White with two cutting points, so White can't even really claim to have only one group...

* Estimate the value of your plays before playing them when making strategic moves: Your invasion at J10 was arguably a bit too deep. However, when White made a very small response, giving him some useful followup moves in the top right, you responded. The reason of playing that invasion was to make a foothold in the area that looked like White territory. If White's not going to kill a big group or something with N13, responding isn't urgent. Carry on making a mess of that middle, or an unbreakable escape route. The J13 move that White took being played by black straight after N13 would have made the game almost impossible for White. Sente is psychological - you want to not respond to a single move if you can get away with it. If you think you've just made a game changing move and your opponent tenuki's, assess whether he can really follow up his move with anything damaging. If not, carry on your own plans instead.

* Invasions when walls are building. Moves like E8 were, as you noticed, just overplays. If a cutting / invading attack like this doesn't work, your opponent will gain strength (and thus points) on the outside as he makes you die. It's far better to take the outside moves yourself for a point or so at a time if it forces your opponent to defend on the inside. If you can't read out an invasion, don't be tempted to play them just in case :)

*** To take to your next few games ***

Try to play more high opening moves, and try to find sequences that give you the thickness instead of the territory. Learning how valuable it can be and how to use it is really important as you try to approach dan ranks!

I hope these comments are in some way helpful. If you have any responses / queries / comments or would like further input on specific moves or areas, do feel free to ask!]
