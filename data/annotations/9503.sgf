C[Thanks very much in advance for reviewing my game! This is a game in which I didnt make big blunders and in fact I felt confident that I would win throughout the whole game... So perhaps you could point out some unconscious errors for me.

I am the white player.

PureThai [5k\]: hi

J: Hi my name is Jay, I'll be review your game.  My comments will start with "J:"]
;B[pd]C[WTS [4k\]: hey, good game
WTS [4k\]: :)];W[pp];B[cp];W[dc];B[eq];W[cj]TR[ce]C[J: Enclosing a corner for himself is ok for white too.  White doesn't have to worry about black extending to C10, because white can likewise extend to K17.]
;B[qj];W[nc];B[qg];W[de];B[qn]TR[nq]C[J: black should approach from the wider side from O3.  Here, black's right side feels very low with 3 stones on the third line.]
;W[nq];B[kq];W[rp]C[Do you like this move? I wanted to make my stones a bit more secure, without losing too much pace.]
;B[pl]TR[jd][on]C[I was happy with this move by B, it looks overconcentrated.

J: You're right, black can aim bigger with P6.  Or, black can take a big point of K16]
;W[jd]C[J: white's framework looks impressive.];B[cl];W[ej]
;B[el]TR[de][cj][ej][cl][cp]C[J: This trade doesn't look good for black since white's area is bigger.]

(;W[oe]TR[ne]C[J: O15 is the correct shape here; it builds the top side while aiming at R17 invasion later.  See variaiton.]
;B[pe];W[pf];B[qf];W[nf];B[oc];W[nb];B[ob];W[od]TR[pc]C[Up to this point I felt very confident, having a lot of potential. Black has made some secure territory on the right though.

J: Black must be mindful of the cut at Q17 later.];B[fj];W[ek]
C[J: no need to play E9 here.  If white wants to protect the top side, simply hane at F11 is enough.]
;B[fk];W[fi]TR[fl]C[J: pushing at E9 earlier implies that whitet wants to cut at e8 and start a fight in the center.]
;B[gl]TR[gi]C[J: since black's side is slightly smaller, black should keep pushing at G11 to reduce white top side.]
;W[gi];B[ji]
(;W[jk]SQ[ji][gl]C[I guess this was my mistake. Black more or less isolates my stone, so my move wasn't really an attack.

J: correct, The first thing to do in an attack is to disconnect K11 from G8.  In this case it's not easy to find a clean separating move, J10 can be considered.  See variation.]
;B[ij]
(;W[iq]C[Here I thought I could invade making some use of my K9 stone. Didn't really work out, though I ended up with a nice group.

J: Invasions are much easier whene there is a strong group to run to, bu K9 is itself very weak.  If you don't have strongbackup for your invasion, one tactic is to touch your opponents stones for forcing moves, like starting with F3.  See variation.]
;B[jp]TR[ko]C[J: Black can also swallow a larger area with L5.]
;W[ip];B[io];W[ho];B[in];W[jq];B[kp];W[gq]
(;B[gp]C[J: touching a stong makes it stronger, black should F3 to take away white's base.  See variation.]
;W[fq];B[hp];W[hq];B[fp];W[ep];B[eo];W[er];B[dq];W[dr];B[cr]
;W[fs]C[J: white is alive now.];B[ds];W[es]TR[gr]C[J: G2 is an easy way to live, by making an easy eye.  E1 makes white's group lose liberties, putting the group in danger.  See variation.]

(;B[jr];W[ir];B[kr];W[cs];B[is];W[hs];B[gr];W[br]
(;B[cq]C[J: black can play B3 to start a ko for white's life. See variation.]

(;W[bs]TR[bq]C[J: B3 makes an eye and worth more points.  See variation.]
;B[bq];W[ar];B[ie]TR[db][cc]C[J: black can also probe the top left corner to see if there are any weaknesses.]

[fc][gc][hc][ic][jc][kd][ld][md][nd][ke][le][me][ne]TR[id][ig]
C[J: the top side is bigger than the M16 area, so blocking at J16 is better.  If white is confident in his fighting, J13 is also possible.]
;B[if];W[jf];B[ih];W[hc]C[How did I handle this?];B[hg]TR[ie]
[if]C[J: Black H13 feels a bit slow.];W[cg];B[ck]TR[ei]C[J: black's C9 helps white protect the E11 cut.]
;W[di];B[gd];W[hd];B[gf]
(;W[ge]TR[fd]C[J: wedging at G15 is unreasonable, as killing G16 is not as important as protecting the corner.  There is a tesuji move for this shape at F16.  See variation.]
;B[fe];W[he];B[ef]
(;W[fd]TR[ec]C[J: also unreasonable.  The only way to protect everything here is another tesuji at E17.  See variation.]
;B[ed];W[fc];B[ee];W[ec]
(;B[dd]TR[df]C[J: Black should push from D14 first, the result is a ko for the left side.  See variation.]

PureThai [5k\]: ty

J: I think the main takeaway from this game should be that white need more practice reading out local fights.  Doing go problems will help.  Thanks for showing me this game.]
