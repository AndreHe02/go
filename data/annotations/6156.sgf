but a black shimari here seems to big for me !?
(LL)

Yes. Unforunately its too late to win game (without blacks mistake) (onur)]

(;B[ed];W[fd];B[ee];W[dc];B[cc];W[gc];B[he]C[You made some diagrams here but atacking upper left corner is a mistake allready. You needed atack middle after atack his corner. You can live there but b will be very strenght other left side and right corner. (onur)]

(LL)
Absolutely yes. (onur)]
(;W[mi];B[ek]TR[fb][dc][ec][gc][fd]C[yes !!! blacks influence is huge...
and also threatens white "triangle" group.
what to do now ???
(LL)

Attacking upper left corner is a mistake already. White needs to attack center before attacking the corner. White can live at upper left, but black will become very strong after the left side and the right corner. (Onur)]

(;W[ij]SQ[kl]C[Too open. He can break you here.(onur)]
(;B[ki];W[kj];B[lj]LB[li:B][kk:A]C[B is better here i think (onur)]

Yes, and resing is good decision here. Thank you. (onur) I do my best. I hope this will be helpful for you. Regards,Onur.]
