C[Good move ! Black must not let White take control of the top side. However, O17 is more normal. A high approach move such as this one is only used in very specific situations.

(;B[sd];W[rb]C[Luke: In this part of the game the white has a huge advantage in the middle, how i should deal with that kind of thing? It's happining all the time on my games.

David : You have a very territorial style of playing, which is not bad by itself but has the side-effect, as you mentionned, of leaving the middle of the board for your opponent to take, very often.

You need to learn to balance territory and influence, I believe. While territory gives you points, constantly playing on the third line and defending territory at all costs makes it hard to expand into the center.

Also, you need to learn to stop defending your territory at all costs. Sometimes, giving away a few points may help you build a powerful attack.]

My final advice would the following.

To Black : learn to sacrifice stones and territory to build up influence.

To White : you're quite the alter ego of Black ! You maintained a lot of influence throughout the game, but a framework is not actual territory. You'll need to learn to translate that influence into actual territory or to attack.

To both : do some tsumego (go problems) and study tesuji to sharpen up your reading skills. For instance, to right corner could still be killed by White at this point of the game ! Or, for instance, White's play at Q3.

Thank you for your submission and remember, if you have any more questions, just contact me ! Good luck !]
