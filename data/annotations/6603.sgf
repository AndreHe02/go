C[Hi, thanks in advance for reviewing my game. I played black in this game and the game was played on KGS.

I decided to play high chinese this game since I've recently played way too many san-ren-sei games and needed a break from that :)

Questions:
-I thought I was doing well during fuseki, but in the end I lost the game by 2,5points. I'd hear your thoughts about my opening play and what went wrong there.
-If it was possible for me to win this game during yose?
-What was my losing move if it's possible to find?


===

Overall you played well. You should familiarize yourself with the chinese opening more, Kiseido has a book called "The Chinese Opening" by Kato Masao that covers it very well in my opinion. 

You should also start analyzing moves in the endgame, so that you take sente moves first, then take gote moves that are sente for your opponent second, then take large gote moves before smaller ones.

My kgs name is AvatharTri, and you can buddy me and message me requesting a teaching game anytime. I'll see you around.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk]C[I've recently played far too many san-ren-sei games and decided to try the high chinese instead.

===

I almost always play the chinese opening as black (usually the low version), and I've found it helpful as a way of thinking differently.]

I'm not sure, K4 isn't joseki that I know of, but it is better in fitting with the fuseki style. See variation.]

(;B[qh]C[===

Whoa, wrong idea completely.

The idea is that the Q9 stone functions as an existing (very loose) pincher, and you should press white into your strength to gain. See variation]

He broke from joseki, he was supposed to cut at O14. It is good for you that he didn't cut, since the top isn't as big for white. Black has to worry about white cutting at O14, since white P17 at this time has weakened them.]
;B[og]
(;W[rc]
(;B[mc]C[===

Almost always extend, see variation. Worse case scenario, you lose an extra stone, after white plays one extra stone (so no point difference), but what will probably happen is black will get several outside forcing moves in sente while white has to keep adding moves to kill]
;W[qb];B[ld]C[I got a nice influence in the center and white got the corner.

Your influence isn't perfect yet, the O14 cut it still a problem (albiet not as big of one as before).]

(;B[ds]C[===

This is rarely a good move. Best case scenario it robs you of yose moves. Worse case is that it gives white the ability to assault your group by exploiting your shape if he ever invades the bottom (though this isn't likely in this case).]

It's almost always a good idea to extend from this kind of atari. Sure, if white plays well, it will get captured (but by white adding in however many moves you had in).

Black settles his top and can expand his bottom. Again, a disadvantage of the high stone is that white can now slide easily at S9, so black has to take that away immediately.]

(;B[jp]C[===

You can do this understanding that White will invade the bottom left and will succeed in that invasion.

Now when white approached the bottom right (which he pretty much has to sometime soon), you'll get profit.]

Here is the high-approach joseki for black];B[np];W[qq];B[qr]
;W[qp];B[rr]TR[qk]C[===

Without the Q/R9 stone from the chinese opening, White normally ends this with an extension to R9, but your stone cramps him. In handling invasions, the low chinese is usually better, but there is a severe capping move at P9 if the black stone is at R9.]
;W[qm]C[===

If white has to live, he'll live small white you can get (somewhat) solid territory along the bottom.

In the low chinese version, black can jump out one stone from his R9 stone, developing a second moyo on topwhile still pressuring white. With the high stone, black can't really do that since the slide to S9 by white is huge.]
;B[rl]C[===

So black normally does a foot-sweeping move to keep up the pressure on white.]
;W[om];B[nk];W[mm];B[mo]C[===

Now black's bottom is nice and secure, and black is getting a top moyo. Of course this is nice for Black, so white may try to resist along the way, and then it's just pure fighting from there.]

White's low approach is even worse for him.];B[qp];W[po];B[np]
