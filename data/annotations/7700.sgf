C[Hello, we would appreciate to have a review for both sides.
Can you point out what are the big mistakes in this game ?
Thank you very much !

[Agi\]
Hi, I'm Aginyan on KGS, and I'll be tagging my comments as I review.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[dj];B[jq];W[mq];B[gq];W[cm]
C[[Agi\] Not really a mistake in any sense, but the C7 leaves white's corner weaker than if white had played C6. That small difference will make attacking black's stones slightly more difficult (because black will be able to make more threatening moves down there).]
;B[qj];W[nc]
(;B[oc]C[[Agi\] The kick here feels a little awkward... see variations.]
;W[nd]
(;B[lc]C[[Agi\] This feels like black suddenly changed his mind. if he wanted to play here, he probably shouldn't have played the p17 exchange.]
(;W[pf]C[[Agi\] A bit odd, see variation. This invites black to split white.]
;B[oe]C[I was not sure about this move, I wanted to cut white stones

[Agi\] This is fine. It's very likely that you get one side or the other. Getting both is probably greedy.]
;W[od];B[pe];W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[qf]TR[mb]C[[Agi\] This feels fine for black. a large corner plus the right side. and if black takes N18, white only has one eye still, so it is a good idea to take it soon and force white to run.]
;W[qm];B[pg]TR[mb][ed][cf][cg][ch][dr]C[[Agi\] Catching Q14 seems like a waste. Saving that one stone isn't going to help white much. Especially with large points such as the ones marked]
;W[me]C[[Agi\] White walks his (semi) weak group out. It's now much harder to attack.]
;B[ec]TR[cg]C[[Agi\] A bit too defensive. At least around the marked point, black would also threaten to go under white's stone. White would want to respond to that move, leaving black free to come back]
;W[cg]C[[Agi\] And white defends that point, taking extra territory at the same time.]
;B[qq]C[[Agi\] This is likely to live, since both extensions are 2-spaces out. if at least one were 1 space out, it'd be at best a ko for black.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[pr];W[or]TW[oc]
(;B[rr]C[[Agi\] This is an offer for ko, black should be able to live here unconditionally...]
;W[oo]
(;B[er]C[[Agi\] This probably can stetch deeper];W[dr];B[oj]
C[[Agi\] in terms of shape, no responding to the attachment isn't a good idea. it's sente for whoever gets it first.]
;W[eq]C[[Agi\] white takes the point, threatening black's stability]
;B[fr];W[ps];B[ro];W[rn];B[rq];W[so];B[df]LB[nd:A][bj:B][cj:C]
[fj:D]C[[Agi\] This feels very defensive and awkward.Anything black tries to build up top would be susceptable to reduction from group A, so black can't expect to make too much up top. Meanwhie, white's left is getting very large

B/C is rather reckless, but white's stones are far enough apart that it's something to want to think about trying soon, especially if black gets some supporting stones around D]
;W[dg];B[ef]C[[Agi\] Similarly, this pushing fight is helping white more than black. Note this makes diving in very difficult now.]
;W[ke]C[[Agi\] And white reduces.];B[ie];W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[hd]
;W[hc]TW[oc]
(;B[hb];W[he];B[gd];W[if];B[ge];W[hf];B[kd];W[je]C[I was worried during the whole game by the white stone at H17, could he have done something with it?

[Agi\] It's gripped in a ladder and everything around it has tons of liberties. It'd be more surprising if he found a way to use it.]
;B[le];W[lf];B[ld];W[mf];B[om]TR[pk][ol]C[[Agi\] Way too messy to read out, but you almost have to wonder what would happen if white resisted at one of the marked points.]
;W[pn];B[pl]TR[bf][em][go]C[[Agi\] Sadly this move doesn't feel like it's doing enough work. it reconnects the P7 stone, but otherwise dies very little. P7 could run or be sacrificed if white wanted to cut it off.

In terms of territory, most of white's points are on the left, so playing moves to reduce it would also indirectly help P7]
;W[mi]TR[fh]C[[Agi\] This feels a bit too ambitious for white. F12 is a safe jumping point for black that would reduce much of the area]
;B[fo]TR[go][fp]C[[Agi\] An odd shape that invites a cut, typically you'd see moves at the marked points more.]
(;W[dn];B[fm];W[jj];B[lp]TR[lr]SQ[fi][jn]C[[Agi\] In terms of pure cash, the triangle marked point is probably worth more. M4 doesn't limit white very much. Sides before center.

The square points are also something to consider.];W[lq];B[kq]
;W[mp];B[lo];W[mo]C[[Agi\] white is alive already, so all this pushing is just helping black]
;B[ln];W[jl]TR[im][jm][gn][in][jn][jo]C[[Agi\] White could reach in deeper into black territory. It helps that white has various peeks and plenty of white stones close by.]
;B[im];W[hl]C[[Agi\] an odd move, why let black get a free peep?]
;B[eg]TR[bf][fh][fj][fk]C[[Agi\] A bit too conservative. If you're aiming to reduce territory, you want to blot out as much as you can safely.]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[ei];B[fi];W[hi];B[mb]C[[Agi\] This move should have come much earlier while white was still unsettled. Now white is safe, so it's just an endgame move (though a fairly large one)]
;W[nb]TR[qa][be][rk][el][lr][es]C[[Agi\] preserving that eye isn't high priority. White has plenty in the center. As an endgame move, there are plenty of larger points that are sente for either side.. such as the marked ones]
;B[bf];W[bg];B[cf];W[kr];B[jr]
(;W[ks]LB[gn:A]TR[qa][af]C[[Agi\] Sente is worth much more than taking gote with L1.

[Agi\] White could also play at A, see variation];B[js];W[mr]
;B[qs]C[[Agi\] As near as I can tell, ko can't really be avoided once black starts down the path. That said, it's not a very easy ko for black to win]
(;W[qr];B[jm]LB[sp:A]TR[dl][cq]C[[Agi\] this move doesn't seem like it compensates for the corner. it claims a good number of points on the bottom, but not the 20 odd points that corner would be worth.

Alternatively, A would be a local threat to make a second ko/escape]
;W[rs];B[il];W[ik];B[kl];W[jk]C[[Agi\] Somehow, worrying about that one white stone being captured seems too slow.

No more comments past this point except at the very end.];B[gk]

[hq][iq][hr][ir][gs][hs][is]C[[Agi\]

Overall neither side was very agressive in attacking the other. Instead it was a relatively peaceful game of building and reducing.

White probably should have erased the ko in the bottom right earlier, and black could have found more compensation in the ko.

Both sides seemed to like making large formations. They also tend to leave easy entrances for the opponent to come in. 

There's a world of difference between having a moyo where the opponent has to invade to reduce, and one where they can jump in connected to a safe group. 

Similarly, both sides are a bit timid in terms of using sente moves to accomplish goals. If you have sente moves, you can invade/reduce deeper, or build frameworks faster and stronger.

For improvement, I'd recommend both sides try to stretch a bit more, try to push the limits of how they build/reduce to get a solid feel for what's possible.]
