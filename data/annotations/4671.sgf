C[macraf [17k\]: hello
macraf [17k\]: good game
Diirk [17k\]: Hello, thanks in advance for reviewing my game
Diirk [17k\]: In this game, I made no real big mistakes, but in the end I was about 15 points behind (I only won because of my opponent making an endgame mistake). I'd like to know what things in my style I can improve :)

Kokorini: Ok, I will do my best!];B[pd]C[Diirk [17k\]: hiha
Diirk [17k\]: ve fun\]
Diirk [17k\]: have fun ;)];W[qp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[ic]C[Kokorini:  may be a little close. I prefer K17. So if black play on the left he is overconcentrated and on the right you con extent to G17 with no problem.]
;B[kc];W[fc]C[see? too close.];B[je];W[jb];B[kb];W[qj]C[Kokorini: perhaps I prefer the left side. This is becouse sonner or later your J17 group will be under so kind of attack, then having a stone on the left wil be useful.
In the other hand, if you are worry about top right corner, it can be invade, dont worry to much.]
;B[qg];W[oj];B[oh]C[K: now, left side seems more urgent I think]
;W[op]C[K: ok, is not bad  any way. (I prefer left side)];B[cn]
C[k: a pince around C8?
the problem here I think is that you are loosing center control/influence, and the game has turn to a strategic one.]
;W[fp];B[en];W[jp]C[K: two coments:
1) too high, K3 better. That land (all the down side) will be easy to invade.
2) Still loosing center influence, If I was black then I start attackin Top group, may be in H18 to leave you with only one eye, forcing you to scape to MY center influence making secure territory around the fight. (see why center has become important?)]
;B[bp]C[Diirk [17k\]: Maybe I should have invaded the left side here?
K: I think it is a little late.
the problem is that K4 stone is too high, so the bad aji (potencial damage) of B4 could be big. 
So, if you invade left side black C6 group will become stronger, then suppose a black stone at  H3.
see variants.]
(;W[cq];B[dj]C[K: Black should be happy with the board position.]
;W[ie]C[K: ok. is good idea to reinforce your weaker area.]
;B[qc]C[K: Ups.... that was your move maybe.];W[fe];B[jd];W[id]
;B[eg];W[ef];B[df];W[fg];B[eh];W[jf]C[K: Black is getting a LOT of land!!!]

(;B[ho]C[K: this is the perfect situation to say THANKS to your oppenent, see var.]
;W[hp];B[mi]C[K: doubble thanks! he is asking you for playing around M14]
;W[kf]C[K:Aaaahhh.. looks good, isnÂ´t it?];B[kn]C[K: Mmmhh.. I Dont like this one.]

(;W[ki]C[K: but I like this one if first you play N14, becouse he has to answer. see var.]
;B[jk];W[hm];B[mk]C[K: you can get in later, first:
- secure your land on the  right
- play N14];W[go];B[in];W[gn];B[fl];W[le];B[ld]C[K: bad answer.]
;W[me];B[md];W[oe];B[od];W[pe];B[qe];W[rh];B[rg];W[io]C[Diirk [17k\]: I think this move was a mistake, it does nothing.

K: yes. useless move.];B[lp]C[K: that stone hearts, know why?
becouse.....  becouse.....  becouse..... 
K4 stone is in fourth line!!

if for example P4 was in P3 then K4 is ok. but you have too many stones in 4 line.]
;W[mo];B[ko];W[im]C[Diirk [17k\]: same for this moce
Diirk [17k\]: move*

K: sadly true.];B[lr]C[K: ouch];W[jr];B[or]C[K: Look! even with your two wasted moves if P4 was in P3  you arent so bad!]

;B[fj]
(;W[jn]C[K: small!!! secure right first!!! P8!];B[ol];W[nk]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[mm];W[ll];B[jm];W[lm]C[K: see how small K6 was? 8 moves later you dont care about it.]

;B[rn];W[qn];B[rp];W[qo];B[pr];W[rq];B[qq];W[sq]C[K:OPS!];B[oq]
;W[np];B[pp];W[po];B[pq];W[ka]C[K: moves lioke B3 are very biggs.

K: Ok, I will stop comments becouse I think is better for you to study endgame  in other time.


i think your stronger area is the tactical things, fights and those things (like me:).
And I think your weaker part is about making plans, so try to look more in the future of the groups.
Ok, top group never was in danger  but it was becouse your opponent didnt work well.
L4 stone in fourth line is another example, you didnt think about a posible future invasion.

So.... gook luck and I hope you get use of my comments. Any questions are very well come.

as long as black remains sente (iniciative) he can do a lot of things]
;B[ej];W[cg];B[hq]C[k: now what? the aji (potencial) of the open corner is BiG, and with the K4 stone in  fourth line, is much better becouse I can move to the other direcction too!
very, very good for black])
