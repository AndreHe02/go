Localy, D3 is not the best option. (3-4 stress the sides more, and since white already has a position on the side, it is not desireable to play on the same side, perhaps C4 could be considered, or D4 to match white's influence in that part of the board.]

Try reading up on opening theory, this will help you a lot in the earlier stages of the game.
