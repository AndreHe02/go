C[Hey, thanks for the review ^^

I played black in this game, white managed to do a really weird fuseki that shouldn't have worked - but somehow he won - and I'm sure I could have won by miles against such a fuseki. So I would really like comments on that part of the game.

I'm reading a little about Shape at the moment, and was wondering if I was doing anything really silly shape-wise.

Any other comments you'd like to make are very very welcome.

Thx, cyar

Hi, this is the first review i do on gtl so please be kind to me.
A word on weird fuseki. I think it's important to point out that just because something is strange or unusual it doesn't necessary has to be bad. And when it really is bad / suboptimal it often takes someone with a great understanding of fuseki (think pro) to exploit it. Kyu players like us can get away with anything :)]
;B[pd];W[je];B[pp];W[oj]C[Playing high and center-oriented like this, white is probably looking for a complicated games with lots of fights. Those white stones are not looking at any territory at all, their sole purpose is making influence. Of course one could argue that they could make territory in the center, but that is unreasonable.]
;B[jp]C[I guess you have a reason for playing here instead of in a corner? I agree that it looks pretty in relation to the white stones. What white wants is probably you taking all the corners and white getting all the funny 10-5 places. And generaly, if white wants something, you don't want it. But in this case, maybe it is good for black?]
;W[ej];B[cp];W[jo]C[Should I respond to this attachment?

---
Short answer: I don't know.
Longer answer:
My very first impulse was: respond, nothing to think about. But then i thought that it is not very good to respond. And the more i think about it, the less sertain I am about the whole bussines. Responding might be suboptimal, but it is alot more safe. Considering whites plan is to attack weak black groups, it might be a good idea to respond. My conclusion is that I suck to much to give an answer. I promise to ask stronger players and mail you what they suggest.]
;B[ce];W[dc]LB[ed:B][ee:A][fd:C]C[Here, my first impulse was A, definitly. But now i think C or B is better. B is a safe move, while C is more tricky. The thought is to prevent white from playing at A.]
;B[cj]C[This looks like black is escaping (when there is no need (yet)). I don't think this gains much territory to black, and white certainly won't get any territory here soon (with black stones on both sides).]
;W[ee]LB[md:A]C[What should I have done here? should I have tennuki on the right side?

---
Maybe. You could play something like A. Further to the left would be too much.]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[fc]C[was this invasion really really bad? looking back I don't like it

---
I don't know if it "works" or not. I looks like something that "might" work. But most important, it is not needed. You could either strenghten you position at the bottom by hane the attachment, or you could play something to the right. White has no "secure" territory, and the moyo is not that scary (yet).]

;W[gd]C[This is very sad. This whole exchange is bad for black.]

I think that before this exchange it looked good for black, and now it looks good for white.]

Not terrible. You did lose some by having lots of weak groups, it was far more common that you had to play defencive than white had to. And you losed some by being passive in the endgame. I think you played good shapes, I did not notice anything "silly". I am sorry I could not help you much with the fuseki.

I wish you good luck and much fun with you further go practice!]
