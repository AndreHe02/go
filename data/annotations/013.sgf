;W[bc]C[B17  not forcing unless corner already under presure from other side so gives sente to B, D11 or E12 perhaps better]
;B[eh]C[E12  takes good point I think];W[ck]C[C9   risky, G14 better first]
;B[ek]C[E9 good point, although stronger player might find severe response such as E5?]
;W[gf];B[de]C[jloup: b e15 was meant to protect against w e17];W[cb]C[C18  block at D14 first]
;B[df];W[dg];B[eg];W[cg];B[dh];W[ff]C[F14  maybe not now, wait on this]
;B[hd];W[dl]C[D8   I prefer D7];B[hh];W[oq];B[pj];W[eq];B[jq]C[jloup: b k3 just created a weak group in gote. k12 would have consolidated the b moyo. I also considered b r17
tom: K3   I like this invasion, should live easily and reduces W side];W
[lq];B[gq];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]C[R15  I would consider Q15 then go elsewhere after W S14]
;W[pb]L[pe][ob]C[tom: F3   small but maybe needed because of D8 instead of D7

jloup: for black next move, I considered b but was afraid of cut at a. b was better. (see variation)]

(;B[pe]C[Q14  definitely play P18, subsequent loss was very huge.  Cut at Q15 not much of a problem since B capturing Q18 or extending to left are miai, while Q16 can extend down toward B stone at K16.  Thus cut would leave W with a weak cutting stone and a weak corner]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[mb];B[mc];W[lb];B[nb];W[na];B[lc];W[kb];B[qm]C[R7   good]
;W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[qg];W[go];B[kr];W[lr];B[jo];W[jh];B[jj]L[kg]C[jloup: blocking at a would have been too small, but I was not very optimistic about my chances of killing W's invasion
tom: K10  perhaps M12 better, strengthens B moyo on right];W[ii];B[hk]C
[H9   perhaps L12 to hold right side, then strengthen D12 group];W[hj];B
[gi];W[gk];B[gj];W[ik];B[hl]C[H8   consider J10 first];W[ij];B[lh]C[M12  too late for right I think]
;W[jk];B[ki];W[kj];B[ji]C[K11  M10 instead, sacrifice 1 stone as not in important point]

;W[ln];B[db]C[D18  K3 group is getting weak];W[ca];B[da];W[ab];B[cp]C[jloup: b c4 bad given the weakness of the k3 group. also b L14 was important (made b h13 possible)
tom: C4   maybe B8 instead];W[cq];B[bq];W[bp]L[cr][co]C[jloup: b c2 (a) was bad.  b c5 (variation) might have obtained something]

(;B[cr];W[co];B[er]C[jloup: e2 disastrous again. I was in byo yomi and very short of time.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[dr];B[ir];W[kf];B[lf];W[le];B[ke]C[jloup: b l15 does not work as the actual game showed.]
;W[je];B[kd]C[sxc 9k*: Increase jloup's time by 2 minutes];W[lg];B[mf];W
[kg];B[mg];W[mh]C[B resigns. discussion sxc-jloup follows.
    sxc: I was scared of your large framework
  jloup: I was scared (rightfully) of you invading it :-)
    sxc: but I managed to reduce it
    sxc: I think you made a mistake in playing q15
  jloup: I was afraid you would cut there and start trouble
  jloup: the 3 stones at e14 were not dead yet, I needed thickness
    sxc: if you are afraid of that you should play r15 at q15
    sxc: letting me escape to the left is too costly
    sxc: you want to build a left facing wall and grab the top side territory
  jloup: I wanted the right side also!
    sxc: if my 3 stones are going to escape ... let them
  jloup: letting you play L14 was terrible mistake
    sxc: it would not be to my advantage to make the 3 stones live
    sxc: yes l14 was a dangerous point
    sxc: but you had to play j2
  jloup: if I play at L14 I still have some hope of playing h13 after
  jloup: the LL corner invasion was a disaster
  jloup: I just weakened my own stones!
    sxc: yes ... you went in the wrong direction
    sxc: my e3 point made it impossible to live in the corner
    sxc: without killing g3 etx in the process
  jloup: I was happy when you let me play d14
    sxc: yes ... it wan`t so good, but I was sure I could live by playing c18
    sxc: you should have answered b17
  jloup: answering b17 at c18 would give you an attack against c12
    sxc: yes ... that's the risk of playing c12
  jloup: when should I play b17? as answer to b16?
  jloup: do you mean I should have played b17 or answered to your b17 move?

    sxc: no ... what I'm saying is that when I play b17, you usually should play b18 or c18
  jloup: I disagree. c12 is then strongly attacked.
    sxc: but I can then invade the top if you let me play c18
    sxc: like I said ... if you play c12 and e12, expect to get attacked
  jloup: w e17 is better than c18, I think. that's why I played d15
    sxc: I don't know ... perhaps it worked out even
    sxc: but the 3 stones at e14 were dangerous to you

  jloup: I will follow your advice and no longer play c12. I don't master this move.
    sxc: I suggest you read up on the josekis

  jloup: I will check. but the common answer to c12 is w c17. that I know how to handle (and was hoping)
    sxc: Ah ... you have to understand my psychology :-)
    sxc: I must go now ...
  jloup: thanks for the game and the comments. bye.])
