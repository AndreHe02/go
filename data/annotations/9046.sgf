C[Hi, reviewer!

I'm black in this game. But since w is better player I'd like you to explain his moves too from time to time. ^^

I have left some comments in the places I thought were most difficult for me to understand. Sometimes playing with stronger players I feel like all is great, but then at some point something happens and it turns not as good. Should I protect things more or is my reading thats needs improvement? If you can answer that after looking at game, then please do. If no, no problem.

And thanks for being so nice and reviewing. :)];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[cn];W[fq]C[[A side question: I also played the same guy later and I played b4 as next move instead d10. Then w played c8. What is black supposed to do in that situation?\]

(;B[dj];W[fc];B[hc];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[fb];B[fd]C[Here I wanted stronger wall, so there wouldnt be much aji and w couldn't invade later on at d13 or something.]
;W[bc]C[This was unexpected, protecting seemed like putting too many stones there with d10 being not optimal extension anymore, but I wonder...

[Nexik\] Yes, this move looks not so good]
