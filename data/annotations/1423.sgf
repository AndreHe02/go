C[[This is a game I (black) played against a computer game (white).

I made a very silly blunder at B41, placing myself in atari, but I would appreciate alll
comments on preceding  moves (or if there is  anywy to salvage the game after B41). I will
mention my thoughts in brackets, but plesae only comment when it's worth it.\]



Hello Alexis,

this is my first 9x9 review. I enjoyed playing IgoWin but I'd recomment playing real persons at your local Goclub or on a Goserver, since Gocomputer make strange mistakes...

greets.
Steffen];B[ff]C[On 9x9 I usually start with a 3-3 point since these secure the corner and 9x9 is highly territory-oriented. I play on 3-4 to have a more interesting game.
You should be aware that 4-4 is absolutely influence-oriented, i.e. with this move you do not stress the corner at all!
Your comment to your next move indicates that you were not really aware of that!?]
;W[fg];B[gg]C[[wanted to secure the corner\]

I would rather think this builds influence  towards the top right corner...]
;W[dc]MA[eg]C[White should better extend here...

osman -- not necessarily.  taking an open corner is just as big as extending.]

(;B[eg]C[I am not really sure about this. I feel a bit uncomfortable about this move. It leaves many cutting-points after white's extension downwards.
see variation for another possibility...

BUT this shape radiates much power all over the board. I think with this move black takes the lead (due to white not extending).

osman -- yes I like this atari];W[fc]MA[ce][fg]C[As white I'd rather make a shimari.

osman -- as w I might take 3-3 in lower left instead.];B[ce]
MA[cf]C[One line below would be a stronger connection. Since white's bit uneffective one-point-jump you would not loose much by playing more solid.  But yes, this is where white would have liked to play with his next move.

osman -- as b I might take the w stone in lower right, to use powerful ponnuki influence .]
;W[cf];B[de]C[[wanted to seperate C4 from upper stones\]

Right. This is very important here. It keeps the groups weak.]
;W[ef]
(;B[df]C[I'd rather play E5 (see variation (heavy load ;-))) since this would make a nice wall against white's top position. Though almost fruitless (because still behind in territory) white could escape with it's E4 stone here...

osman -- how about b atari at E5.  If w connect, b then takes the lower right stone.]

(;W[fh]C[...or fool around with G4 (see variation).]
(;B[eh]C[[feared that playing E5 might let white expand into lower region\]

I think it would have been better to capture. To me it looks like too many white stones and too many ways to cut here.
See variation here and in next node.

osman -- yes, I would have captured.  Sometimes two different moves are both good, but one is simpler !]

(;W[bf]C[Playing white I'd rather try something on the right side. See variation.]
;B[be];W[gf];B[ee]C[[in retrospect, isn't F5 better? it maintains the connection with the left but moves more
into the up and right.\]

Yes, I think F5 would have been better, too. For the same cause.]
;W[gh];B[hg]
(;W[bc]C[Since playing H2 does not seem to work for white, how about H4?
See variation...]
(;B[hd]MA[gf]C[[now i'm sweating about how i've lost the north. i wasn't sure if H6 was too aggressive or
too meek. maybe H7 or H5?\]

Why sweating? Since white left so many stones in trouble you are way ahead in territory (consider the whole buttom as yours). So the motto in this stage of the game should be "play save!".
I would just capture the marked white stone with G5 or G6.
See variation, the game would be over for white.];W[hf];B[hh]
MA[hd]C[[with this move I believe the white group of 3 is mine. for taking.\]

Yes, and since H6 white cannot connect to the group at the top.]
;W[ge];B[gd];W[fd]C[osman -- but what if w played ko atari at F5 instead of F6 ?]
;B[fe];W[if];B[ie]C[[preferred to J6 since it reduces more liberties.\]

Yes, this is joseki.];W[hi]C[[seemed pointless to me\]

Well, it is sente and creates ko-threats. See next node...]

(;B[gi]C[Just a little note:
Your move creates one more ko-threat for white!  Since now there are potentially two:
w F1 would threaten to capture the three black stones, so E1 to get rid of this threat. But this still leaves the threat of w J2 of J3.
So there are two threats. (See variation in next node!)

osman -- simplest seems to be b atari at H5 instead of this G1

If you played F1 immediatelly, there would only be one threat since you could capture the threating part of white's group at once. (See variation in this node!)]

(;W[hb]
(;B[gc]C[[hoping to cut H8 off and claim upper right, but this seems impossible. yet Black-G8 is
cuttable, i think. should I be approaching at B6 or A6 instead?\]

If you want to play here, play G8 directly. This will give you sente to play A6 (not B6). See variation.

BUT since you are way ahead in territory there is no need to play risky at all!  And as you have seen the "dead" white stones in the middle right still have some potential ;-)

So A6 right away seems ok to me.];W[gb];B[cg]C[[unnecessary?\]

I think so. Better A6 to rob white the threat to connect.];W[fb]
;B[ae]C[Since you are ahead this is ok, too. And sente since threatening A7.]
;W[ad];B[ig]C[[Here is my foolish blunder, which ends the game I belive.\]


oh, well, what a blunder...];W[ih]C[Here would be time to resign.

osman -- yes, b had a good game until here !];B[ei];W[fi];B[ed]
;W[ec];B[bd];W[cd];B[ac];W[bb];B[ab];W[ba];B[dd];W[cc];B[ad]
;W[aa];B[ib]C[[trying to keep these black fragments alive. impossible, yes?\]

There is no way.];W[ic];B[hc];W[he];B[id];W[ic];B[tt];W[hc]
C[You already played very firm. Without your blunder you would have won big!
One thing I'd like to repeat is that you better play save and solid when ahead. Playing risky or too fast  bears the danger of making a stupid mistake.

Hope you enjoyed my review and get something out of it!])
(;B[gb];W[gc];B[hc];W[fb];B[ib];W[ga];B[ad]MA[he][ig]C[This one is a bit risky since it leaves you in a shortage of liberties on both sides. You will have to caputer the three white stones before you can capture the other four.]
