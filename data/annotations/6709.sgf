C[I've been playing double games against my friend who introduced me to go shortly after he started playing. I finally won one game from the last double. This is taken from the same pair but the one I lost.

R: hello, I'm your reviewer. I'll review this game for the white side. I'll start my comments with "R:" and leave yours. At the end of the game you'll find my summary. Should you have any more questions feel free to ask me.]
;B[qp];W[cp];B[pc];W[dc];B[jc]
(;W[jp]LB[dc:A][cp:B]C[R: Minor mistake. A isn't established and B Could work better. See variation for further explanations]
;B[pj];W[dj]CR[ce][de][pe][qe][op][eq][oq]TR[dc][cp]SQ[pc][qp]
C[up to this point i've been mirroring to keep balance of influence and balance of the board letting him attack first. is this good or should i have tried an invasion here?

R: This isn't that good or that bad. It isn't that bad because the left side looks quite ok, mostly on the lower side. It isn't that good because the marked stones are not established, especially D17. The two black marked stones are in trouble too since they are vulnerable.
I circled the invasion points you are vulnerable to and marked with letters the weaknesses of your opp.
You will notice that if the opponent cuts at C15 or D15 your upper stone is kind of lost]
;B[mp];W[lq]LB[ce:B][de:A][cf:F][ep:C][eq:E][fq:D]C[I wanted to keep past the half point on the edge and thought responding low would give me some security to anchor against the side.

R: you always have to think this, when you're playing GO: what is the biggest move?
You don't have to reply to any single opponent move directly.
Here A or B are quite urgent. and very big. F is good too but a bit complicated.
CDE are fair alternatives];B[mr];W[mq]C[R: endgame move. You can't cut through your opponent's  stones. This only takes away from him a couple of points while you can make many more by establishing D17 or attacking Q17]
;B[nq];W[lr];B[or]C[R: never try to go throug a 1 point jump: you'll only strenghten your opponent. now he has the lower right corner]
;W[jj]LB[gd:B][de:C][pe:A]C[here i was satisfied that i had a sufficient wall starting and wanted to expand my moyo.

R: see past comments about the stability of your moyo. Regardless, if you want to expand it you can try by a high invasion on A or B. But you have to play C in this situation]
;B[fb];W[eb]LB[ce:A]C[should i have gone with A instead to protect the left side? I thought that D10 provided some influence and that I needed to prevent a stone at D18 as a reply to a move at A

R: Yes, you should've. I replyed this thouroughly before.];B[gc]
;W[fd];B[ce]C[Here B chose to move at A. perhaps move 20 should have been there instead?
R: yes of course. It's a common rookie mistake in the opening. 20 is a wasted move]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[bf];W[ad]LB[dg:B][bh:A]C[R: endgame move...  You should have tried to prevent further invasion at A and then play B]
;B[be];W[de]LB[bg:B][ch:A]C[R: Ok. A or B should be good too, maybe better since they prevent the seek for eyes on the side where they are easy to find]
;B[ae];W[ac];B[ch]C[R: this is why A or B at move 28 were better]
;W[dh];B[cj];W[ck];B[bj];W[bk];B[di];W[ei];B[ci];W[ej];B[dg]
;W[eh];B[df];W[ee];B[pf];W[ms]LB[eq:A]C[R: This is an endgame move that wins you a opint or two... you have to prevent an invasion at A, just like the one Black did before]
;B[nr];W[gp];B[pn];W[fc]LB[he:A][jg:B][lo:C]C[R: too small again. A, B or C are way bigger]
;B[hb];W[fa];B[gb];W[ef];B[mc];W[mm]LB[jj:C][jp:A][lq:B]C[R: I don't like this stone. It's too far away from its neighbours A, B and C and can be easily cut]
;B[nn];W[mo];B[no];W[lp];B[np]LB[mn:A]C[R: A is a cut point for Black and white should defend there]
;W[mj];B[mh];W[lh];B[lg];W[jh]C[R: mistake... L12 doesn't give a cut point to the enemy]
;B[kh];W[li];B[jg];W[ki];B[kg];W[ig];B[if];W[ge]LB[ih:A][mn:B]
C[R: A is  a cut point and so is B. these are problems to take care of]

(;W[nl]C[R: see variation];B[mn];W[lo];B[ln];W[kn];B[lm];W[km]
C[here i became more worried about his movement into my moyo that i didn't see it forming an attack on my stones from N6-P8

R: It was already too late to defend, I think. You played correctly trying to prevent an enormous invasion into your moyo]
;B[ll];W[kl];B[mk];W[lk];B[ml];W[kk];B[eg];W[fg]C[i noticed here the weakness of his group and decided to attack at C13 once I had sente.

R: If black plays B13 now the group isn't weak and has two eyes. You picked the correct time to attack, though]
;B[ns];W[ls];B[aj]
(;W[cg]C[make the attack
R: I don't think that C13 is the best place to attack. See variations for further insight]
;B[bg];W[cf];B[bh];W[ak];B[pm];W[gl]LB[dl:A][dq:B]C[R: why here?
A - to prevent a cut
B- to be extra sure on the corner

if he tries to invade there you can make his life very very hard by preventing him to find the sides and so to make eyes]
;B[qh];W[qd]C[it was close here, but i think i was just a little behind and so needed to attack. i really don't know how to attack as the sequence will show. that's why i tried to expand my moyo early and then defend the edge while simplifying. any help you can give from here is much appreciated.

R: you tried this attack far too late imo. but if you wanted to try you should have tried at R17, sicne the 3-3 point can make live forms even in difficult situations. In order to live, in fact, you have to search for the corner and, in this situation, can only be made with R17.
I honestly don't know if you can make any good forms, though, due to the strong black stones]

;B[pd];W[sb];B[qb];W[mf]LB[sc:A]C[R: this is a big mistake, an insulting mistake.
if you have seen that A is a false eye and tried to play away for the group is dead ok but this move has no purpose... the opponent isn't an idiot and can see the threats of your cut]

C[White: 94 territories + 5 prisoners + 6.5 komi = 105.5
Black: 99 territories + 34 prisoners = 133
Result: B+27.5

R: To summarize:
1) You have to try and strenghten your stones, if played at komoku (3-4 point)
2) you have to try and find bigger moves and invasions when they are possible
3) you have to avoid cutting points in your walls.

I hope this review helped. contact me if anything is needed :D]

)))
(;W[ml]LB[mk:A][nl:B][mn:C]C[R: this shape is better, it prevents two cuts, A and be, that could be followed by C]
))
(;W[de]LB[ce:A][de:C][pe:D][cf:B][op:E]TR[jc]C[R: placing a stone in A, B or C establishes the corner making many points. Furthermore you have a balance between territory (the corner) and influence.
There are many ways, btw, in which you can take advantage of black's mistake (the marked stone), maybe with a direct attack on his corner at D or E, but I think that enclosing some points should be the best thing for you]
