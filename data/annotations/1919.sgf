C[May I ask for review, please. I need review on moves before my opponent
make a move on 3-3 at my territory, after that I already knew my mistakes,
thank you.

This game reviewed by Richard Rumley (richard@rumley.net)

I am somewhere around 3~5 kyu AGA.  I haven't played in a tournament in years, and am starting to play more regularly in our local club (The Santa Cruz Go Club.)

If anybody has any questions or comments, please email me, and I'll get back to you.

All of my comments will begin with RR:];B[dp];W[pp];B[dm]C[RR:  Black should play in one of the empty corners.  This move is too slow at the beginning of the game.]
;W[pd];B[cd];W[dg]TR[ed][ec][pj]C[RR:  If white is going to approach the corner, do it from the upper right, perhaps one of the marked areas.  This will work with your stone at the Q16 location.   Don't fall into the trap of "black's area looks too big, I must reduce it" with only three stones on the board.
If you are worried about big moyos, then play on the right side with the white stones, by the marked point.
The white stone that was played at D13 will have hard time being captured, but will also have a hard time making life and/or connecting to other stones.]
;B[fc]TR[ec]C[RR:  Black makes a move in the correct area, but I would have played at E17, one stone closer to the corner stone at C16.]
;W[id]TR[dj]C[RR:  White should extend the lone white stone on the left side.  If the upper side wasn't that important last move, why play there this move?
Putting together several moves that have the same meaning is a great step to becoming a stronger player.]
;B[cj]C[RR:  Black makes a good attack move on the lone White stone.]
;W[ci]TR[fg]C[RR:  Black has made a good attack move on the lone white stone.  Attaching to a strong stone is a good reaction.  (later I make the comment about when to attach to other stones.  Basically, if you are weak and they are strong, go ahead and attach.) However, I would use the J16 stone to jump out to the center.  This keeps it simple.  (I like simplicity in my games!)]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[ej];W[dj]C[RR:  I think it is too early to cut.  Make eye space by extending on the upper left side.]
;B[dk];W[di];B[cl];W[aj]TR[cf]C[RR:  I'm not sure what this move accomplishes.  Even if black ignores, white cannot capture, and white cannot make eye space.  A better move would be to extend upwards, and make white eye space.]
;B[bk]C[RR:  For white, a good place to leave this shape, and try to make eye space.]
;W[ak]C[RR:  A wasted white move, which endes with black having sente.]
;B[al];W[ai];B[cf]C[RR: White ended up in gote, and black took the vital point.]
;W[cg];B[jq]C[RR:  Black has a big moyo going on right now.  As black, I would have played on the 4th line, to work with the big moyo on the left.  Now would be a good time as white to jump into the 3,3 point.    In general, if your opponent has a stone on the 4,4 point, and has extended out on both sides (I think the books call that a doubled winged formation) it is a good time to jump into the 3,3 spot.  It is a sente move, and will reduce blacks territory.]
;W[lq]TR[pj][qj]C[RR:  Believe it or not, I think a bigger point right now is on the right hand side.  One of the two marked points.]
;B[gp]TR[jo]C[RR:  Black is not aggressive enough.  Always play away from strength.  If black wants to make more territory, build walls.  Look at the marked point for black.  A move there would be huge.]
;W[de]TR[fh]C[RR:  I am worried about the life of the white group.  Is it strong enough to attack the black group next to it?  I don't think so.  I would rather run away,(and secure the life of the stones) and then come back and fight.  Of course, it depends on what black's next move is.  If he connects, then white can connect, and build a wall facing right.  But if black plays D14 and cuts... things get interesting!]
;B[dd];W[ce];B[be];W[df]C[RR:  I think that B14 captures the black stone and makes two eyes.  However, the D14 move makes strength.   I would have made eyes, and given black some more strength.]
;B[bf];W[fd]TR[ge]C[RR:  Remember these words.
1.  Touching your opponent's stones when you are weak is a good thing.  Touching your opponents stones when you are strong is a bad thing.  White is strong in this area, as is black.  By touching stones, black will only become stronger, and white will gain very little.

I would have played the marked point.  It is a good jump away from the thick wall, and if black plays inbetween my wall and my extension, then I would be very happy to fight there!  I always enjoy a fight in areas where I am strong.]
;B[ed]C[RR:  ouch.. good move by black.  The white stone looks very weak right now]
;W[gb]C[RR:  I don't understand this move.  It doesn't flow with the other stones on the board.

I would still jump out and save the stones on the left.];B[gd]
;W[fe];B[gc];W[hc];B[fb]C[RR:  Ok.. the G18 stone was in the right spot.  White must have read this out.]
;W[ga];B[fa];W[ib]TR[pj][gg]C[RR:  For black to capture these two stones, it would be gote, and only a few points (4?)  There are bigger moves on the board to take, like Q10 or G13]
;B[ge];W[hf]C[RR:  Again, I don't understand white's move.  The white group on the left is starting to be in alot of trouble!  Time to run away, not force strong stones into them!]
;B[ff];W[ee];B[gf];W[fh];B[gh]C[RR:  Good moves by black to trap white.]
;W[fg];B[gi];W[fi];B[fj];W[gg];B[hg];W[ei];B[if];W[he];B[ie]
;W[hd];B[ih];W[kd]TR[ef]C[RR:  If I'm not mistaken, black's move at E14 kills the white stones.  I think that white needs one more move here.]
;B[ke]C[RR:  For Black, this seems like a very very small move.  Attacking the upper right corner would be a better choice.]
;W[md]TR[ld]C[RR:  I would have not jumped one space, but rather connected at M16.  Black is forcing white to make a wall on the 4th line.  This is a good thing for white.  By making a one point jump, the L16 stone is weak, and could be cut apart.]
;B[hj]C[RR:  A wasted black move.  If white cuts, then black plays at this point anyway, and has lots of room to make two eyes.  Play bigger points!]
;W[pj]C[RR:  Yay!  White finally got THE big point.];B[qf];W[qe]
TR[qh]C[RR:  Hmm.. tough decision.  The stone at the 4,4 point (Q16) is for attacking, not for corner territory.  I might have pincered at the R12 spot.  However, the upper group seems weak to me, so pushing black into my weakness would be a bad thing too.]
;B[of];W[pf]TR[mf][nj]C[RR:  Think bigger than the cut.  You could play at N14, and then later at O10.  The cut will still be there, but there are BIGGER moves on the board right now.    Fighting is fun, but always look for the big points.]
;B[pg];W[pe];B[rf];W[re];B[oh];W[qh]C[RR:  Cutting here might have been more fun. But, black would sacrafice the two stones, and build a strong wall.  So I guess that the peep was the right move.]
;B[qg];W[pi];B[rh];W[ri];B[ph];W[qi];B[mf];W[ne];B[nf];W[pm]
;B[cq]C[RR:  Black didn't want to attack whites lower right 3,3 spot until his was defended!  Sometimes a clue as to what your opponent is thinking.]
;W[jl]TR[jg]C[RR:  This looks like a good big point.

White might want to also peep at K13, just to have another white stone in the area before making big moves.  It makes quite a psycological difference!]
;B[hl];W[in]TR[jn]C[RR:  I think this might be too aggressive.  White needs to be concerned about black's K3 stone sneaking in.  I would play at the marked K6 location.]
;B[hn];W[ko]C[RR:  Good recovery.];B[lj];W[kj];B[ki];W[jj];B[ji]
;W[ni];B[nh];W[mi];B[li];W[mh];B[lg];W[mk];B[kk];W[jk];B[lk]
;W[ll];B[io];W[jo];B[im];W[jn];B[ip];W[kr];B[jr];W[sh];B[jm]
;W[km];B[kl]C[RR:  Ouch.  Good attack by black.];W[il]C[RR:  Save this for a Ko threat, as these stones are dead.]
;B[hm];W[lm];B[qq]C[RR:  White knows the mistakes from this point on.  My review will end here.

If white conceals black properly, and goes on to make the white group on the left side live.  I count the following score:
W 78
B 105

Lessons learned from this game & review:
1)  Always look for the big point in opening.  Don't get caught up in petting fighting.
2)  Look for ways of using all your stones to work together when fighting.   3)  When two stones touch, both sides get stronger.  Only do this when you NEED to have your stones get stronger, and don't care about your opponent getting stronger.

Good luck!
