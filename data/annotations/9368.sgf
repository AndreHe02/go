C[J: Hi, my name is Jay and I will be be reviewing your game.  My comments will start with "J:"]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[cd]C[I know my opponent and I felt like he wanted to know the mini- or micro-chinese. In the past I've often felt that I was much worse at handling these standard openings than my opponent.]

(;W[ed];B[qo];W[df];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc]TR[dc]C[He fell for this trick, but I made a mistake in the order which made the result less of a punishment.

J: Yes, black should simply fall back to D17.]
(;W[dc]TR[dd]C[J: White D16 is simpler.  See variation.];B[dd]
;W[db];B[gc];W[gd]C[J: White can should not play G16 as it is pushing from behind.]
;B[hc];W[bb]TR[bc]C[J: B17 puts more pressure on the two black stones, B18 is slack.]
;B[cf]TR[hd]C[I think I need to push one more time here now?

J: White should try not to push from behind.];W[cg];B[dg]
(;W[de]TR[df]C[J: White should play E14 here, as D15 makes the marked stones lose liberties.  See Variation.]
;B[ce];W[hd];B[eg]LB[bc:B][ee:A]TR[ff]C[I think playing here would have been best. It makes miai out of capturing the top or the left.

J: Black can also consider A to complicate the situation, or make a play for the corner with B here.]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[jb]
(;B[jc]TR[hb]C[J: Black K17 is a good idea, but both players should realize that h18 is possible and allows black to live while allowing white a strong wall.  See Variation.]
;W[id];B[kb];W[hb];B[ja]TR[ff]C[I suppose I could still have played it now?

J: At this point, F14 will only induce black to play C12, so it is a "thank-you" move.]
;W[gb]C[J: At this point, the position feels better for black; as black has sente.]

(;B[ee]TR[nc][ch]C[J: Black should make a base at O17 first, D15 stones aren't important because E15 and C12 are miai.  See Variation.]

(;W[pq]LB[op:A][oq:B][qq:C]TR[lc]C[J: because black omitted O17, white can poke at M17 to see what develops.

J: Q3 is a very territory oriented move and can lead to very complicated variations.  Some other easy possibilites are A and B.  C  is also possible to claim the corner.  See Variations.]
;B[op]TR[np]C[J: Black can play O4 to threaten the taisha variations.  This would work better with black's left position.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[mq];B[pj]TR[qi][qj]C[I wasn't sure what to think of this move. Could you perhaps indicate some other joseki continuations or completely different josekis for the 5-3 point that could have been meaningful in this situation?

J: This is an ok idea for black.  Q10 is better at R10 or R11 because in this position, the territory on the right side is more important than center influence.]
;W[mp];B[qf]CR[ja][ib][kb][jc]TR[nc]C[Could you propose alternatives to deal with this move? I felt split between protecting my corner and trading as I did in the actual game.

J: Backing off to O17 is enough, as it threatens M17 to attack black's four stones.]

(;W[no]C[J: O5 is too small. White's top right stone is now in grave danger.]
;B[nd]
(;W[oe]TR[pf]C[J: Normally, the correct way to handle this pincer is an attachment at Q14.]
;B[qc];W[qd];B[pc];W[qh]C[When I played this move my opponent uttered "that looks like an overplay doesn't it?". I felt like I could use my lost corner for some forcing moves to make profit on the right.

J; He was right, this is an overplay.  With so many black stones nearby, white is too weak to pincer R14.  White will most likely get cut up to pieces.  The problem here is O5.]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[og];W[oh];B[ng];W[ne];B[me];W[mf];B[md];W[nf]

(;B[ni]C[J: Black should just solidly turn at O12.  See variations.]
;W[nh];B[mg];W[mh];B[lf];W[lg];B[od];W[pf];B[qg];W[kf];B[le]

(;W[rd];B[rh];W[ri];B[rg];W[qj];B[re];W[rc];B[rb]C[J: This result is too good for black, and it's an uphill battle for white now.]
;W[oo]TR[fq]C[I decide to remove some of the aji. Was this unnecessary play?

J: If you play in this area, you have to be sure to be able to kill black. F3 is also a very large move.]
;B[gq]
(;W[cp]C[J: considering that black's left side can grow ver large, a reduction at C6 maybe  called for.  See variation.]
;B[co];W[dq]C[I somehow wanted to use the attachment in order to get thickness towards the right.

J: White should not be able to get thickness towards the right after G3.  The point of C4 is to get the corner or the left side.]

(;B[cq]C[J: Black C3 is a mistake, should be at E4 instead.  See variation.]
;W[ep];B[bp];W[eo];B[eq];W[fq];B[er];W[fr];B[dr];W[gp]C[J: This result is good for white.]
;B[dl];W[fl]C[J: F8 is a good idea.];B[qq]
(;W[qn]C[J: R6 is trying too hard to seal black in.  Q7 would have sufficed.  Another idea is to attack black starting at R2.  See variation.]
;B[rn];W[qm];B[rm];W[qp];B[rp];W[pp];B[ql];W[pl];B[pm]
(;W[pk]C[J: Q9 shouold be at Q6.  See Variation.];B[pn]C[J: Oops.  Letting black live easily here is painful.]
;W[nm];B[ol]TR[ej]C[J: black should tenuki now.  E10 is large.]
;W[ok];B[om];W[nl]C[After the game, my opponent mentioned that he felt like he got a lot out of this exchange, but I felt like this was actually good for me because it helped me get stronger in the center and black did actually get many points and R2 is sente endgame for me.

J: black should have left this area after living.];B[nk]C[J: Black's cut here is unreasonable when white has so many stones around.]
;W[qk];B[oj];W[lh];B[nn];W[mn];B[ll];W[mk];B[ml];W[mm]TR[nj]
C[J: taking at O10 is better.];B[lk];W[mj];B[lj];W[mi];B[hk]
;W[fj]TR[lj][hk][lk][ll][ml]C[J: white must kill these stones to get enouhg points to win.]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[hj];W[gh];B[hm]TR[fl][eo]C[I felt uneasy with respect to the large knight, but I felt like neither one of my two groups were in too much danger at this point. Is there a way for black to cut in a meaningful way?

J: You are correct it is ok for black to cut here has long as both of white is safe, and black remains disconnected;  but, black can use the aji here to try to live.]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[jn];B[gi];W[fi];B[fh];W[fg];B[eh];W[gl];B[hl]
C[Is there a way for black to cut from this position?

J: Yes, because of shortage of liberties, see variation.];W[ji]

J: not anymore.];B[io];W[hp];B[fn];W[em];B[en];W[dn];B[dm]TR[gm]

J: yes, black should connect at H7];W[gn];B[hn];W[go];B[ip]

(;B[is]C[My opponent mentioned something about a ko being possible if he had not played here. He messed up the order I think.]
;W[jg]TR[ja][ib][kb][jc][pd][qo][qq]C[J: now that black is dead, black doesn't have enough points.

J: I think the main takeaway from this game is that you should mind your own and your opponent's weak groups.  The triangled groups were iun danger at one point or another, and making them safe or attacking them is more urgent than big points played.

J: This is my last comment.  Thanks for showing me this game.]
;B[jo];W[lm]C[From here on I am no longer exactly sure about the order of the moves. I second guessed my self a few times, but I don't think the endgame was that important either.]
