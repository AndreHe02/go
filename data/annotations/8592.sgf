C[digital8 [5k?\]: hello
digital8 [5k?\]: have a good game
I'm black in this game.  Ends up very close.  I got lucky because I got lazy twice and played protection moves.  Just wondering about better direction of play throughout.  Thanks!


hi my name is Mythical , 1k on KGS, and i will be your reviewer tonight  :)
my comments will start with [M\].


[M\]: overall , you played well in this game - but you did had some problems with direction of play , and played some very small /slow moves.
hopefully i will help you to fix your mistakes.];B[qp];W[pc]
;B[dq];W[cd];B[co];W[kq]
(;B[nq]C[Not sure if this was the correct extension.  Push towards stronger side?

[M\]: i would attack from the other side , you need to put pressure on white's group , the way you played was too loose - basicly he lives easy and you cant bother him too much.
the rule of the pushing oponent towards stronger side applies when you can attack the oponent's group.]
;W[hq]
(;B[pe]C[Better than an extension or no?


[M\]: the basics of the game are to take corner , then side and then center - because corner is easiest place to make points (then side and center).
so your move is fine ! not letting white make big corner teritory is fine idea !

but , in this position extension also works !

so , this will be decided by style , do you like build moyo and frameworks? or do you love to deny oponent from making points himself?


one more thing to consider , is that any fight that happends on the right side , you will have some advantage there .]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[qd]
(;B[pf];W[nc];B[qj];W[qk]C[Not sure how to deal with this]
(;B[pj]C[[M\]: this is of cource possible , this move says black will not help white to make life or shape , white will have to figure out how does he makes life himself.]
;W[ql]C[[M\]: this is very heavy (slow) move by white .
he needs to live fast and with good shape , you should be able attack it well.]
(;B[qn]C[[M\]: this is 1st option , dont let him make a base.
(this also helped you to make corner stronger)];W[ol];B[nj]
;W[ml]
(;B[cf];W[ec];B[di];W[ci];B[ch];W[cj];B[cl]C[Should I have protected the cut at D12?

[M\]:sometimes you need to protect , bit right now white is weaker so no problem here.]
;W[dj];B[ei];W[ej];B[fi];W[fj]
(;B[ff]TR[fj][ej][dj][cj][ci]C[This seems slow to me but I'm aiming at an invasion/reduction

[M\]:yes this does seems slow, the E10 group is weaker than yours !!
keep on with the pressure .];W[gi]SQ[fi][ei][di][ch][ff][cf]
TR[fj][ej][dj][ml][kq][hq]C[[M\]: white gets to play the power move.
you asked about directions , well take a look at white now.

1st of all , white group is getting stronger while black's group is getting weaker ! part of the game called go is to keep your groups strong and oponents groups weak.
(if your group is strong you wont have any problems , and if oponent has weak group you can attack it and make profit)

2nd thing is , white stones are starting to work together now! 
with so many stones of same color working together , black will have hard time doing anything useful in the center.]
(;B[fh]C[Better way to deal with this?

[M\]:this is bad shape and very slow , dont play moves like this unless you dont have other choices.]
;W[gk]
(;B[ic]C[Don't know the ideal spot

[M\]: if you just want to make something on side , your move is fine.]
;W[kc];B[gc]C[Seemed I would only get an unideal extension so better closer to my other stones?

[M\]: yes good thinking.];W[ed];B[mf]TR[ic][gc][ff][fh][fi]
[ei][di][ch][cf]C[[M\]: one thing to remember , these 2 groups are not that strong - white can split attack them .]
(;W[lo];B[hj];W[gj]
(;B[jk]C[Reduction attempt];W[lk];B[ji]C[Going for less fighting and figuring the middle will just end up no-ones - that's my hope at least

[M\]:well , you have to reduce center , if white gets it he will have a lot of points.]
;W[il]
(;B[lj];W[kk];B[jl]C[Better than L10?

[M\]: K8 seems fine.];W[kj]

(;B[bg]C[overly cautious move 1?

[M\]: yes.];W[hf]TR[gc][ic][jd]C[I should have kept attacking white?

[M\]: not easy to kill white , and first you have to make your top group stronger.]
