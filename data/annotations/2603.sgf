RE[B+Resign]

C[First off, thank you for reviewing this game. This is my first time using the Go Teaching Ladder.

Even though my opponent resigned rather quickly (too quickly, I thought) I didn't feel that this game was easily won.  It has been quite a while since I last played a non-handicap game, and I think I made a ton of errors (mostly in the opening) that I would not like to make in the future.

Comment: Andre Bergholz (marked with AB)];B[dq];W[ec];B[qp]
;W[qd];B[co]C[Shuusaku fuseki; my usual opening.  I wasn't sure what white was trying to do, and I think that not knowing how to respond hurt me.]
;W[pk];B[od]C[I think this would have been better one space up, at P17, because of what followed.

AB: You should not worry too much about the fuseki. It's something for the professionals :-). We lose for other reason. I do think P17 is slightly better, but P16 is ok. A second shimari is another option.]
;W[mc]C[Pincers me.];B[pf]LB[qc:A][ne:B]C[Probably a very bad idea. Better at R17?

AB: Yes, not that great, because it permits White to connect underneath at P17. Black has to prevent that. R17 or O15 are possibilities.]
;W[ph];B[qg]LB[qc:A]C[Original idea was for him to respond with R12 and then attack R16, taking the corner. It was naiive of me to think that he would respond. Better at P17/18?

AB: Definitely better at P18, but I think making a base at R17 is best. You need to worry about your own stones. With three against four you don't attack anything.]
;W[oc];B[pc]LB[oq:A][ng:B]C[Another mistake, most likely.

AB: Well, you can't prevent the connection, so you may think about tenuki (P3 seems goo to me). Running out with O13 is an alternative, too. Your stones are weak up there.
White has taken the lead. You see that fuseki considerations are useless at kyu-level play. Letting White connect at P17 is the big mistake here.]
;W[pd];B[oe];W[nc];B[qc]C[Bad, right?

AB: Well, doesn't work, so it is unnecessary.];W[rc];B[qh]C[AB: Good! Changes the balance of power between the two groups in your favor. Seeking a base for your stones is important.]
;W[pi];B[qj];W[pj];B[qk];W[qi];B[ri];W[ql]
(;B[rk]LB[sj:A][pl:B]C[Necessary?

AB: Bad shape! Protect at T10 if you must. I think cut at Q8 works (see variation).]
;W[op]
(;B[oq]C[AB: I think you chose a wrong joseki here. If you attach on the upper side you can put White's group on the right into trouble. That would give you a very good result, because you already have the territory there and are able to attack the wall (see variation).]
;W[pp];B[pq];W[qo];B[rp];W[pn];B[np]C[AB: Very good!];W[nn]
;B[jq]C[This seemed like a good idea at the time, but I don't think it was the best move.

AB: This move is not bad. A kakari in the upper left may be better.]
;W[lq]C[AB: This is completely out of question.];B[lp];W[kp]

(;B[mq]C[AB: Cut is better (see variation).];W[lo];B[mp];W[ko]
C[I'm not sure why white connected at the top instead of the bottom. Possibly to prevent my black breaking into the center through N1?

AB: I think connecting at the bottom is better.];B[kq]C[AB: Black has a good game now.]
;W[ip];B[cd];W[de]C[Ok... I've never had someone play a 5-3 point opening against me, so I was a little worried about how to respond to this hand.]
;B[ce]C[Bad?

AB: No, good.];W[df]
(;B[db]LB[cf:A][cg:B]C[AB: Not so good. Better keep pushing C14 or even jump C13.]
;W[eb];B[dc];W[cf]C[End results seemed ok, with the possibility of cutting the two apart in the future.

AB: No, the result is very bad for Black. Tiny corner (will barely be alive) and completely enclosed on both sides. There is no cut for you (see variation). White has caught up.]

(;B[jd]LB[le:A]C[Overplay? Maybe something on the 3rd line?

AB: The direction is good, a White moyo must be prevented. I would just extend the Black group to M15. Neutralizes well both the upper and lower part of White's influence.]
;W[le];B[jf];W[kg];B[gc]C[I thought I would use this to make a 3rd line base for my other two stones while threatening to separate white's two groups on the left.

AB: Ok.];W[fe];B[ge];W[gf];B[he];W[jg];B[ig];W[ih];B[hg];W[cl]
C[After white made this huge jump, I knew I needed to reduce the amount of territory he would make on the left, so I decided to push my H13 group into the middle and then use the influence to attack the left side.

This was also a pretty bad change in direction.  I think a better move would have been to just keep going with the flow at H12. At this time I was getting extremely worried about the size of white's potential territory and was wondering if my black on the right and a possible reduction on the left would be enough for me to pull off a win.]
;B[hh]C[AB: Excellent move. You need to prevent to be shut in. You need to be present between White's two potential moyos.]
;W[ii];B[hi];W[hk]LB[ij:A][di:B]C[Big mistake for white?

AB: Not a big mistake, but J10 would be solid. I would protect on the left, though.]
;B[ij]C[Right here, I thought that I saw an oppertunity to really hurt white's middle, so I completely forgot about the left side.]
;W[hj];B[kf]C[Just pushing white in sente...];W[lg];B[lf];W[mf]
;B[mg]C[My only decent move the whole game (I think).

AB: Yes, White should have played here and let you connect, then the big issue is the left side.]
;W[ki]C[White resigned before I had a chance to play my next move. The resignation surprised me, as I thought that I was still behind by quite a bit (when it comes to counting territory, I'm still a 30kyu).

I just didn't feel very good about this game once it ended... I thought white still had a chance to make some big territory on the left, reduce on the bottom and top, and salvage enough middle to win...

I made too many mistakes to have won this game.

Thank you for your time.

AB: Yes, there is no reason to resing here. The left side is a big unresolved issue. I added four big moves to it and I think the game is very close then. Your main mistakes were to allow the connection on the upper side and the very poor variation in the upper left. Altogether this was not a bad game at all. Don't think too much about fuseki, but more about the middle game, attack and defense. If you have any more questions don't hesitate to contact me at Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com.]
