C[Hi! This game was played because of the 2004 Iberoamerican internet go torunament. I think i clearly won the game(you may give me your impression though), but i have a lots of doubts from some moment i felt i had the game won, but didn't know how to concrete(indeed i think i was lucky).
If you want to make comments abou other aspects or plays, it will be welcome
Thank you for the review

Hi Juan,

I've assigned this game to myself to review since the GTL seems to be a little short of reviewers, if you aren't already, you could offer to do some reviews?

My normal method of doing reviews is to go through the game three times.  

The first time I just say my initial impressions having not seen the result.  I find this pass is useful because it shows any difference in opinions and ideas.  I don't add any variations in this pass to give you an idea of how far I'm reading.  

The second time I look for when things went wrong and suggest alternatives that I miss in the first pass.  This is perhaps moves that are a bit harder to see in advance, and I will add full variations.  I also leave in any mistakes I made in the first pass. 

Finally I add general comments, quizzes and the like.  These are really to give an overall commentary to the game rather than get lost in the details.

My final comment on the game.  You played very well, consistantly outplaying your opponent and reading very accurately.  My main criticism would be that you missed many opportunities to simplify the game.  Your opponent has a classic IGS style -- play deadly moves and hope something comes of them.  You delt well with them, but on a number of occasions you chose to play the ambitious move where the simple move leads to victory.  You could probably do with counting a bit more, and looking for the simple moe when you're well ahead.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[jq]C[--
There is nothing wrong with this move, but you could also consider L3 to threaten the small chinese fuseki.  If white resists, perhaps with F3, then you can shift to perhaps the K16 area.

Reviewing for white now... K3 is a little further than L3 so you'll want to be thinking about at P4 area at some point.  Of course, no hurry.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[cn]C[--
I would also consider F3 here, though you would want to finish in sente to take C11.

Reviewing for white.   It looks like black's plan is to scare you with a double pincer after you jump to F3.  Since K3 will be a loose pincer this doesn't seem too concerning, but are there any alternatives?  C8 seems ok too, black will play C3, W C4, etc.  it seems K3 does not cause many problems and it makes fairly good use of D16.  But I still prefer F3.]

(;W[fq]C[What about this one?
--
Oops, just remembered you are white! Sorry.  I'll leave the comments I've already written in, and go back and write comments for white

I would play either F3 here, though a longer keima would also be possible.  A black move around G3 would act as a severe double pincer and also a nice extension for K3 so you don't want to allow that through a move at D6 or so.  The main problem with this variation is black gets a little more benefit from k5 later, but it seems a minor problem.]
;B[dj]
(;W[ch]C[And this?, i think it's important, but, i might feel unconfortable if he plays something like Bb4-Wc3-Bc10
--
Taking B4 yourself is tempting, but I would personally not play it quite yet.  If K3 was just a little stronger (e.g. replace K3 with J3 and M3) then I would definately play B4 now. 

One criticism of C12 is it strongly reminds black of the C8 weakness and tempts black to B4 immediatly which is not especially desirable.  If you instead played say P3/4 then no doubt black would pincer but you should be able to end in sente and then take B4.  Perhaps P3, N3, O4, Q7ish, R2?]

(;B[ci]C[--
I think this move is a mistake by black.  B4 would be better.  It strengthens the top at least as much as it strengthens black.]
;W[dh]C[--
At this point, you've build a nice framework in the top, and you have a small group at the bottom.  Black has a small group on the left side, and a large but wide open framework.  So the key question is if black's open framework is worth more than your smaller but more solid one.  Apart from the already discussed B4, that makes the obvious moves P4, K5 and Q9/10.

If black turns the game into a battle of moyos, his is bigger, so his invasion seems wrongly timed.]

(;B[id]C[--
Heh.  Black has been reading "the compendium of trick plays"? Ok.  The goal of J16 is to make sabaki in white's beautiful framework, overconcentrating the already strong white stones.  Since I wouldn't say white has a beautiful framework yet, I think it is a mistake.

Of course, as with all trick moves, a bad response will cause you lots of trouble. I personally would simply descend to K17.  This will encourage black to jump, perhaps to E18 if he intends to continue this sabaki style, or F17 if he wants to swap to more normal play.  But I really don't see it causing any problems.

Another thing to keep in mind... the C/D 12 exchange has made b4 much more critical.  Because of the placement at B8, the move is now double sente.  So solid play here is particularly important because it will make taking sente easier.]

(;W[ie]C[--
I don't like this move because of the reasons already given.  Black was only ever after sabaki, and this move merely shifts where black will get it.  Also, you're emphasising the outside which does not seem especially important.  If you really did have the beautiful framework before J16 (perhaps C15 and Q18) then I would be much less critical of J15.]
;B[hd];W[jc]C[--
Ok, you're now back onto the line I read. My main fear was black would play K17 instead of H16 and set up the ladder.]
;B[he]C[--
Yuck.  This is not sabaki shape.  Since white only has a framework, I would take black's move as an open invitation to turn it into territory.  I think white should be very happy with how things are progressing.  Specifically, I would play F17 here, but E17 or a few other moves are also good.]

(;W[if]C[--
This is fine, but doesn't seem necessary.  If white was stronger around D16 then it would be good, but you're forcing black to attack a group that is only moderately strong. I also don't especially like leaving the cutting point at K15, and you're building a wall towards Q14.]
;B[ec]C[--
I prefer E18, D17 or F17, but this is also sort of ok.];W[dc]
;B[gg]C[--
Right.  I would take B4 now.  Jumping to J12 is also quite good.  There are a few nice moves around E10, F12, but I would worry about loosing the weaknesses at C8,C9 so wouldn't play them yet.]

(;W[ej]C[--
This is ok.  My main concern is black will fix weaknesses here, probably getting B4, and leave you with awkward shape in the bottom left.]
;B[di]C[--
How odd.  Black is obviously aiming at E12, but white will be on the fifth line with plenty of liberties, whereas black will have a huge weakness at D8.]
;W[ei];B[eh]C[--
Stepping back to look at territory/influence.  You have a few points on the board in the top left.  Otherwise the game is still pretty much frameworks.  If black gets P4 then that framework will build very fast, so it would be nice to get sente leaving here and take P4.]

(;W[dk]C[--
I prefer E9, but your move cannot be called a mistake.  D9 is a little more severe but leaves an unfortunate weakness.]
;B[ck];W[bi];B[cj]
(;W[dl]C[--
I prefer C8, D8, B9, E9, B10, D9.  Now D12 is extremely strong and white only has E10 to worry about.  Don't sacrifice E10, it is useful.]
;B[cl];W[dm]
(;B[cm]C[--
I expected B6 instead by black.  I would take either B4 or D6 here... hm, I prefer B4 even though it lets black out.]
;W[bp];B[dn]
(;W[fm]C[--
Can also consider the even simpler move of F9.];B[fn];W[gn]
;B[fo]C[--
E6 may have been better for black.  I would play G8 now, or G7.]
;W[go]C[--
This is ok, but how are you going to answer E7? if E7, F8, then black E9 later causes problems E10. Given this, I worry that F4, E3 by black is going to cause you problems. 

Ok, it turned out that was me being overly cautious.];B[fp]
;W[gp]
(;B[ep]C[--
Oh! that went well :-)];W[eq];B[en]C[--
Now, G8 or tenuki? I think G8 is better.]
(;W[gm];B[do]
(;W[cp]C[I think this sequence was clearly advantageous for me
--
Yes.];B[bj];W[ih]C[I'm looking to the right side
--
Sure.  You could also jump to R12 first.];B[fh]
(;W[df]C[--
Feels a little slow.

But on reflection, it is pretty important.];B[em]C[--
This is why I prefer G8 to G7.];W[fk]C[I don't care now for D8]
;B[mp]C[I felt unconfortable here, didn't know how to use my (influence/thickness???) now he played defensively
--
Yes, that's the problem with getting central influence so early.  Somewhere along the right side looks good, anywhere from R12 to R9).  Alternatively a severe attack on H16 etc.

Lets see how the score is going... Black still does not quite have any points in the bottom right, though it is quite close.  Perhaps we should count it for 15?  Black also has a bit in the top right, and can make it a lot more in just a couple moves.  Black has perhaps 5 points on the left, for a total of 25, and moves like Q10 being the logical development.

White has about 20 pts in the top left, and 20 in the bottom left, plus komi.  So white is roughly 20 points ahead on the board and has sente.  White has a few moves that will develop the top -- such as H18 and O14.  If you can do moves like H18 in sente then that's fine since they don't cost you anything.  O14 seems bad since it gives black exactly what he wants (Q12).

So, I would stop and read out H18 carefully to ensure it is sente (not to ensue the kill, too hard and unnecessary).  After that, (or before if it was gote), I would invade at R9 or similar.  P4 feels wrong now to me.]

Good.  Even if the attack fails now, you're building thickness.]

Of course i think i'm clearly ahead, but, what would have happened if i had failed to kill that group... Indeed, i thought i couldn't kill it when he played Bh13, i think i'm better anyway, now, i can clearly call those stones thickness. But i don't know how to use it effectively... O16 is natural in other circumstances, but, it would e quite overconcentrated, and he could get to play in the right side...
--
You're doing fine even if black is alive.  Had black lived in sente that would be slightly unfortunate, but that shouldn't happen.  

Lets count again.

You have about 70 pts at the top, and 20 pts in the bottom, plus komi, for almost 100 points.  Black has E9 in absolute sente, so more like 15 points on the left now, and black now has about 20 points in the top right to go with the 20 we already gave black in the lower right, 65 points. 
The main concern is black taking the whole right side, that seems the logical place to play next.

However, Roughly 75 points is a won game, though moyo games can occasionally give both players over 100.  So, very ordinary play by you with no mistakes will lead to an easy win now.  That makes O16 fine.]

(;W[qh]C[--
Since you're so far ahead I would play O16.  If it was closer then I agree with something on the right side, though R12 seems a bit much with P17 already played.]
;B[nd]
(;W[mc]C[--
Playing N17 seems a little contrary to R12.  I would have played R9 or so given you have already played tenuki once.]
;B[qg];W[ph]C[--
I think lighter play is called for here, perhaps R10?];B[qk]
;W[qn]C[Was this play a too much confident about my thickness?
--
No, but it would have been easier had you not exchanged Q12 for R9.]
;B[ok]
(;W[on]C[--
S4 or Q4, or even R3 also worth considering];B[po];W[pn]C[I think this was a mistake, i though i could never get heavy witho those stones supporting me, but,  think Wo7, would have been much better

I agree it is a mistake, I would have played R8 rather than O7, though I think O7 is quite nice.]
;B[mk];W[mn];B[lo]
(;W[ln]C[--
M7 probably better];B[kn];W[km];B[jn];W[nh]C[--
Er, how are you going to handle the M7 cut?  Peep at O8?]
(;B[md];W[ll];B[lk];W[kk];B[lh]C[--
Lets hypothesise that O12 dies without compesation now (i.e. make believe R17 doesn't work) and recount.

Again, you have a bit over 110 points (because you get a few more points with N17, and you're getting a few points around J9).  But really you've just reduced black.  

Black had 65 before, and has increased this to 25 on the bottom right, a huge 55 in the top right, and 10-15 elsewhere.  In total you're still ahead, but you've lost most of your lead.

What went wrong is you got in too deep and got into trouble.  If you are ahead, then light reduction is called for, not running away with two heavy groups.  If you succeed in running away, you win by more.  But there is nothing gained by that -- you're better just playing simply and winning by 20.]
