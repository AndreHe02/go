(;B[qh]C[Q:  Was this or R8 (or something else) the best move?  I thought extending from my enclosure was top priority, but I also thought I was too overconcentrated.

N: that is the standard idea here, I don't see anything wrong with it. Of course you could play on the other side too, making a double wing formation]

(;B[nf]C[Q: Was this a good response?  If not, what's a better one?  This move freaked me out a little bit.

(;W[cc];B[bl]C[N: It's a good idea to strengthen those stones, however it would not be necessary if B had played the slide into the corner earlier. This makes W very solid in the bottom left]

(;B[if]C[Q:  Was this a good way to reduce?  White's moyo was getting rather terrifying...

N: Let's count the reasonably secure territorries first:

Black:
upper right: about 25 points
bottom: at least 30
left: about 10
_________________
total: about 65 points

White:
bottom left: about 15
right: about 10
top: about 30
komi: 6.5
___________________
total: about 61.5

By this count, it seems close but black is slightly ahead. However, this completely ignores possible points for black in the center, where black has a lot of influence. So the W moyo does not seem that terrifying to me, especially if B gets to play O18.

The best strategy IMO would be to reduce white while also scoring points in the center.

The move you played is a little too far into white's sphere of influence for that purpose, since it becomes a target for attack, which helps white erase black's central influence.

C[N: Looking at the result up to here, you can see that the W moyo didn't really get reduced, furthermore W has a strong group facing the center now, making it harder to make points there for B.]

No more comments about the rest of the endgame

I think the key move that could have decided the game was the marked stone, B57. It's always good to count or at least estimate the score before deciding on where to reduce / invade.

Other areas to work on may be how to attack a stone like W20.

Also paying more attention to sente/gote in the endgame.

Other that that I did not detect any systematic weaknesses, your tactical reading was solid.]
