C[N:  Hello, I will try to review this game my best,  it was somehow a onesided game and you did good.
Next time please leave a SGF that do not have tons of variations, as it will be very hard for me to review the game later.

The last 100 moves did not need a review, it was a onesided game and your mistakes was one move mistakes easy to be found by yourself.  Your biggest mistakes was in the start, however black did not play correctly and your mistakes become smart moves.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[oc];W[nq]LB[dj:B][qj:A][qn:C]C[N: I will not say this is directy wrong, but A-B-C are bigger points.]
;B[oq]LB[jp:A]C[N: This is called the kick.  And is in a position like this no good for black, if black wants to play the kick he should have a stone at "A".]
;W[np];B[qn];W[kq]LB[jp:B][jq:A]TR[np][nq]C[N: You have a two stone wall, we say we should do a three space jump from a two stone wall.
Therefore A or B had been correct];B[fq]LB[jq:B][kq:A]C[N: This is wrong for black.  However it is possible as whites stone "A" is not at "B".]
;W[hq]LB[jq:B][kq:A]C[N: This is wrong in theory, but can be okey.  You want to push the black stone agaist your strong group.
However this would been much easier with "A" stone at "B"];B[dq]
;W[ep]LB[dj:A][cq:B]C[N: This is wrong. What will happend here is that black will get a huge corner, while white gets a big wall.
However white has no extention around "A" therefore playing like this is not best.

Playing "B" would be the common answer.];B[eq]
(;W[fp]LB[cp:A]C[N: Playing "A" would been better, as you do not have an extention.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B[gq];W[gp];B[gr];W[hr]LB[cf:A][cg:B]
C[N: This is small. you need to extend on the left site. Maybe around "A" or "B"]
;B[cj]LB[ch:A][ci:B]C[N: You can see that as you got Gote black could play inside your walls. 
But this is to close, and black should have played "A" or "B".]
;W[ch]C[screwed869 [9k\]: so, W plays d12 to push black towards white strength; should i play c11 or d11 instead?]
;B[cm]C[screwed869 [9k\]: there are too many possibilities for me to see what is the best response]

(;W[bl]LB[bj:B][bm:A]C[N: This move can be smart, however there is also a counter to this move.
This move has Miai at A and B to connect.

We say that we would capture before killing eye's.  Going under black is wrong as he can easy escape.]

(;B[bm]C[N: See Variation];W[cl];B[dl]
(;W[bj]C[N: Now you uses one of the Miai points.
However black can get a strong outside wall.  And that is no good.]

;W[fl];B[fm];W[gl];B[gm]C[screwed869 [9k\]: white kept running because allow a black cut would be too messy, is there a better way to treat this situation for both black and white

N: White has gotten a superior result.  However black played this out very wrong.]

(;W[pi]LB[qf:C][qi:A][ql:B]C[screwed869 [9k\]: is there a better way to attack the right side? w played on 4th line to reduce, build shape with w group in the middle
screwed869 [9k\]: invading on 3rd line doesn't seem like a good idea, leads to white getting pushed around. is that accurate?

N: In this situation is different as white has a huge wall from the center, so playing on the 4th line can work very well with this wall's-
Playing on the 3rd line is more common, and playing at "A" and you will have Miai on "B" "C" to make a base.]
;B[kn];W[ln];B[kk];W[ik];B[lk];W[lm];B[qg];W[ql]C[N: This is the same as we showed before, the only different is that black can play S11, so this is not as good as if both had been on the 3rd line.]
;B[ri];W[qj]C[N: This is small];B[rj];W[rk]C[This is also small]
;B[nl];W[om]LB[pm:A]C[N: This shape can be cut.  Safer to play "A"]
;B[nm];W[nn]LB[on:A]C[N: Again this is not safe. Play "A"];B[li]
;W[jc]LB[oc:B][li:A]C[N: You want to cut "A" and "B"];B[ng]
C[screwed869 [9k\]: awkward shape for black, right?

N: Indeed strange shape, but works.];W[pg];B[ne]LB[li:A][qj:C]
[on:B]C[screwed869 [9k\]: black shape seems to have lots of weaknesses, what is the best way for white to take advantage? or should white just play something like k13 and start building moyo?

The problem here is that as soon as "A" is alive, black will cut at "B" and white "C" is in very bad spot.]

(;W[qf];B[rg]LB[mh:B][ni:A][mj:C]C[screwed869 [9k\]: on second thought, attacking here seems too small

N: Attacking here is small, I would played "A" later try to cut with "B" or "C"]

N: Yes]
(;W[ic];B[eg]C[N: Here is also of things that could gone wrong here.

In the rest of the game white just played a lot of poor moves, and lost a lot of your stones.]
