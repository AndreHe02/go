C[Hello, my name is Andrey and I played black.
Thank you for taking your time to review my game.

This is Wonodan from KGS, I will be reviewing your game.]
(;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pq];B[gq]TR[dj][po][qo]C[W: There is nothing wrong with this move, but it is worth knowing that usually black makes a san-ren-sei (three star points on one side) at D10 or an approach around Q5 and R5.]
;W[qo]C[W: D16 wants to develop towards D10 and K16.

Q16 wants to develop towards K16 and Q10.

When both players have stones that want to develop towards the same direction, it's usually a nice plan to take it before your opponent.]
(;B[dg];W[fc];B[db]C[W: A very large, steady move.

While taking the corner, you threaten to attack the white stone with a pincer.]
;W[ic]C[This is an oponent I have a couple of times and our games usually flow very peacefully.

W: J17 is indeed a peaceful, steady move.]
(;B[nc]C[Here I decided to invade but looking at this board now I think Q14 or R14 would have been better.]
;W[pf];B[qc]C[W: Invading might be unreasonable here.];W[pc]
(;B[qd];W[qe]C[W: "Hane on top of two or three stones without looking"

White gets optimal shape while giving black bad shape.

R15 is the so called "hane on top of two stones".

Powerful attacking move.];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[re];W[rf]
(;B[sd]C[It seems this was a wasted move.

W: It was a good move.

Black needs to add a move at T16 or S16 to avoid dying.];W[lc]
;B[kd]TR[ob][fc][ic][lc][oc][pc][pd][qe][pf][rf]SQ[nc]C[W: Very aggressive move.

White is very powerful in this area.

It is very reckless to start a fight head on.

2 vs 10 battle.];W[kc];B[ld];W[md]C[W: This is the second time you forced yourself in the "hane on top of two stones" situation.

This shape is good for white, and bad for black.];B[kf]C[W: You will face a tough fight. 

All white stones in this area are connected, while your 3 stones in the middle are lost in Whiteness.]
;W[me]
(;B[pj]C[The idea here was to invade the right while building influence towards the center.

W: Splitting the right side is a large move, but I would be most worried about the three stones in the center.]
(;W[qi]C[W: When your opponent plays diagonally underneath you, it's a good plan to push him.]
(;B[pm];W[qj]
(;B[qk]C[maybe Q11 was better for what I wanted to do?];W[pi]
;B[ok];W[oi]
(;B[rk]C[W: When you play here, you try to attack your opponent or create a base, but in this case white is strong above (can't be attacked) and it's hard to create a base because R5 is peeking at it.

It is most important to get out first.];W[rj];B[rn];W[ro];B[qn]
;W[lq]C[black seems alive and can probablky reduce white's lower right but whites p11 will allow white to go into the center.

W: Yes, black is certainly alive.]
(;B[jp]C[would M11 be a good move instead of what I played?]
;W[lo];B[jn];W[lm]
(;B[mk]C[A keima at L8 would seems nice instead I think.];W[cn]
(;B[dk];W[en];B[fk];W[gn]
(;B[ep]C[should I have extended the other way?];W[bp];B[cq]
;W[bq];B[co]C[W: All this move does is help your opponent connect (making him stronger)

while reducing your own liberties (making you weaker)];W[bo]
;B[cp]TR[co][dp][cq]C[W: Since you had to come back to defend, maybe it wasn't worth playing at all?

You created two empty triangles with one move.

They are bad shape, because black has few liberties and no potential for creating eyes.]
;W[dn]
(;B[ck]C[too defensive? Should I have played B7 in sente and then extended?

W: Not too defensive but too small for this stage.

It is not the endgame yet.];W[ie]C[W: White will get many forcing moves since black didn't protect his group in time.]
;B[kh];W[ig]
(;B[lj]TR[dd][dg][dk][fk]C[K10 looks a bit better i think.

W: The marked stones have lost some of their influence they had to build a moyo.]
;W[ee];B[de];W[ef];B[df];W[eg]C[W: White got territory in the area that could've been black's.]
;B[eh];W[fh]
(;B[ei];W[fi]C[W: At his moment, if you consider your groups safe and can't find a target, it's time to start making all those big endgame reductions.]

You have practically nothing to lose, while white is going to lose everything if he loses this ko.

It could even be called a "flower-viewing-ko" for you, since it's such a trouble-free situation.]
)
(;W[mq];B[pr]LB[qp:B][lq:A]C[W: White can't try to evade, or this will get even messier.

Notice that if you win this ko, the A and B groups both die simultaneously.

An allmighty ko.

This ko is worth about 80 points.

I doubt white can afford to lose this, so you can basically threaten anything and get it.]

Notice that all of white's stones are on the right side.

It's polite to start from the top right area.
