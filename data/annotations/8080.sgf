-------  ~~~~~~~~~  ---------

hi, i'm pzykr (pz is pronounced like an "s") and i'm a 10 kyu. i'll be reviewing your game and trying to answer your questions.

i recommend that you set your sgf viewer to show all move numbers, as i usually refer to B11, for example, instead of the stone at q10. when i do refer to a point i will use lower case, as in this example. 
hope you enjoy/benefit from this review!];B[pd];W[cp]C[kanghj [19k?\]: hi]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[pj];W[np]
C[should i have placed above the black stone instead?

pz: i personally don't think so... but i don't really like this move either. it would be difficult to settle a group in the black sphere of influence above and the move here simply invites an attack.]
;B[lp]C[pz: black immediately attacks. instead of W12 at o4, how about at l3? then you have the two space extension on either side to make a base and you split the black stones on the bottom. as played, black's stones work together better.]
;W[nn];B[pm]C[was it a mistake for me to allow him to build up the right side completely?

pz:  not necessarily: for example, if you used your moves to build up the top completely you would have equality.  but playing as you did, giving black an opportunity to attack you while building his right side completely and getting nothing in return except a weak group that has to run for its life--yeah, that's bad...]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[iq];B[kq];W[jo];B[dn]C[pz: don't really understand black leaving his three stones around l3 in this weak position--you might have taken some advantage of him by attacking here with your next move, i think, though those stones can be pretty slippery and killing them outright might prove difficult.]
;W[dl]C[is this a mistake? should have have placed at B6 instead?

pz:  mistake? yes, i think so. you play such that B21 is directly cutting your stones' connection.  b6? i dunno... how about e4 or e5? cut his stones instead.]
;B[cn];W[ep]C[pz: i like this move (W24)--you've ganged up quite a few stones against B5.]
;B[hq];W[fp]C[pz: h4 here instead; makes good shape
specially cause look what happens next move...];B[ip]C[pz: ouch! no more chance to attack the three black stones around l3...
if you'd played as i suggested (at h4) your stones would have a more cohesive shape.]
;W[io];B[ir];W[hp]C[pz: the atari of B27 is not worth allowing B to play at g4...]
;B[gp];W[go];B[ho];W[hn];B[hp];W[fn];B[eo];W[fo]C[pz: white shape is heavy but there are some pluses here: there is the beginning of thickness on the bottom and the three black stones on the left, B23, B21, and B37, are weak.  too bad it's black's turn to move:)]
;B[dp];W[eq]C[pz: ? d3 only move];B[dq];W[cq];B[dr];W[fr]C[pz: small move: what would capture of B5 really accomplish?]
;B[gr];W[dg]C[pz: what is the purpose of this move? it doesn't make territory--the third line is the line of territory; the fourth line is the line of influence or power. but all the action is at the bottom. why choose to tenuki-- (play away from the scene of action)?]
;B[in]C[pz: a punishing cut! it's not difficult to read out that the ladder doesn't work...]
;W[jn]C[I have no idea what would a better move be?

pz: remember i said earlier you had the beginnings of good thickness on the bottom? this cutting point was a serious defect that needed to be fixed so the thickness could mature: it could easily have been defended with W46 at j7... without reading it out deeply (regretz--i'm a little pushed for time), since the cut ~has~ been made, i would start looking at W48 around m5 or so, i think.]

;B[lj];W[mj];B[ki];W[kl];B[jl];W[jk]C[pz: nice tesuji (finesse)! this is called the crane's nest, where B's connection at l8 merely loses two more stones]
;B[nh];W[kl]C[pz: this can turn the whole game around. now your stones are connected, you have central thickness, and you can go on the attack. it's important to keep in mind that one doesn't use thickness directly to make territory: one uses thickness to attack. one often can push the opponent's stones into one's thickness and kill them.  remember the proverb "don't play near thickness." this applies to your own thickness as well as the thickness of your opponent.]

;B[kf];W[jg];B[jh];W[ie];B[el];W[ek];B[fk];W[fj]C[is a triple hane like what I did an appropriate response? or should I have done F8 instead?

pz: i think your opponent was rattled by the big capture; the triple hane turned out much better than it should have. rather than f8 the solid connection at d9 to start something building on the side might be something to consider... f8 is too near your thickness.  instead of d9, perhaps cutting off B91 from B21 with the diagonal move e7 would be a better plan, working to push B91 and B93 into the thickness and capture. i take it you're trying to attack these two stones: a good rule is never to touch stones you're trying to attack: your triple hane touched these stones twice. my suggested move of e7 is the exception that proves that rule, actually, as it cuts the two stones off from what seems to be a safe group in the lower left corner

yeah, lots of different ideas to choose from! it's nice to have choices, huh?]

C[pz: i like W144. you lay claim solidly to the corner this way.

i have no comments from move 103 to here because the play seems loose and inaccurate...maybe it's brilliant and i just don't get it........]
;B[op];W[oo];B[po];W[oi];B[ph]C[pz: W148 good reducing move; it's small, but yose (endgame) plays often are. one might question, though, whether there are bigger moves? a good rule of thumb is "forcing moves first." that way, one maintains sente (initiative) for a few more moves as the opponent needs to respond. on the other hand, it's often worth giving up a few points to ignore (tenuki) such a forcing more in order to wrest sente back from an opponent]
;W[oh];B[og];W[mi];B[mh];W[le];B[lf]C[pz: last three moves are good examples of forcing moves maintaining sente]
;W[mg]C[ignore this move, i was just trying my luck to see if i could end up making some miraculous tesuji to kill him]
;B[ng];W[pi];B[qi];W[ni];B[oj];W[ol];B[pl];W[qj];B[pk];W[qh]
;B[pg];W[ri]C[pz: seems like a nice tesuji (finesse) to reduce B's terri on the right]
;B[rg];W[rl];B[rm];W[ql];B[qm];W[jj]C[pz: ah. W174 gave up sente (ie, was gote) when there were at least a couple more forcing moves available: can you find them?]
;B[qk]C[pz: now B starts with forcing moves and sente shifts to B: can he hold sente?]

;W[np];B[er];W[gq];B[no];W[gs];B[hr];W[np]C[pz: a complex little ko situation... this might be fun!]
;B[sj];W[rj];B[no];W[hs];B[np];W[is];B[js];W[fs];B[es];W[fq]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[af];W[ae];B[ag];W[bd];B[sh];W[si]C[some comments on how to handle the bottom right would be nice. :)]
;B[rh];W[ch];B[bi]C[pz: bottom right---have you read out what happens if you cut at r5? (hint, think ladder)
does that ladder make it difficult to do much with the lower right? have you counted the points? do you know about what the score is? do you need any points on the lower right to win the game? what are the "big" (relatively) points? what are the ~urgent~ points? never stop looking at the whole board and evaluating everything you see!]
;W[sm]C[pz: but then, when you've evaluated the global position, examine the local position, too. this move is a wonderful tesuji (finesse)! it's good for reducing the corner significantly. very well done!]
;B[sn];W[so];B[ro];W[rn];B[qo];W[sp];B[rq];W[sq];B[sn]C[pz: or rather, might have been!! the ko presents the opportunity to reduce the corner... 

big ko threat at c10... another one at k2... i think this ko was maybe winnable for W and the corner could have been reduced.  of course, B did have the absolute ko threat of g6 or f7... and another big one at c14... hmmm..... hard to say what choices the players would make.

if you've counted the score and know that white is just slightly behind it become obvious that the only option is to try the ko...nothing ventured nothing gained]
;W[rr]C[kanghj [19k?\]: ah
kanghj [19k?\]: oops];B[sl];W[sk];B[sm];W[cj];B[bj];W[di];B[qg]
;W[qi];B[qr];W[qa];B[ra];W[pc];B[od];W[mb]C[pz: W238 useless move! why capture a dead stone? fills in one of your own terris and gives black W234 for free... this move is very close to the difference in the game...]
;B[pa];W[oa];B[qa];W[tt];B[mn];W[tt];B[tt]C[pz: couldn't you find a ko threat? i see at least a couple... you just gave B another point for free... the final winning point? perhaps...

i hope i didn't sound too critical during this review:  you came very near turning a disastrous early game around into a win, you played a number of very nice tesuji, and, up until the very end, you showed good fighting spirit. i hope you will continue to play this wonderful game of go! it only gets better... thanks for paying attention to my going on and on... hope you find something useful here and thank you for the opportunity to review this game! good luck to you!

peace
