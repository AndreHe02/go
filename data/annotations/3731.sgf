C[Thank you for the review.
I guess I make a lot of mistakes, and I need your help, caoch.

This is an exiting fighting game and both players seem to enjoy fighting. It is easy to advice you studying Tesuji and Life&Death to improve your skills but I think the main reason you have lost this game is not a difference fighting skills but that you lost the course during the fight. So I recommend that your are asking yourself questions like this, while playing:

What is the goal of the attack? To kill or to get territory while attacking or to split the opponent or to shut him in or to reduce or...?

Who attacks and who defends?
Who is weak and who is strong?

What do I want to get and what do I want to give?

Which preparations are necessary?

How is the balance of thickness and territory?

Playing fighting Go is fun but to improve you have to take fighting as a tool and not at the purpose of the game.

I hope that I have helped you, but please take my comments as the mere babble of a weak 3d. Please prove my variations by yourself and build an own opinion to my statements.

Hope you will improve your game
Yours

Yes. Let's consider alternatives. (see var)];B[dc];W[db];B[cd]

LB[nd:A]C[A looks lighter.];W[pc];B[od];W[qd];B[pf];W[qf]C[Good for White. Makes full use of R13.]
;B[id]TR[od][pd][pf]C[For me, K15 or M17 is prefered.
But I am confused then.

Yes, M15 or M16 looks better. The marked stones are weak and should be developed. J16 is like a young dog, who just wants to play. It is just barking not biting. White should play K15 (see var)]

(;W[ic];B[jc]
(;W[hc]LB[kc:A]C[This strenghtens a strong group. I would play A. (see var)

The game shifts here from better for White to better for Black.]
;B[kc];W[md]C[I think it's a mistake.

Hard to find a better move.];B[je];W[kd]LB[nc:A][nf:B]C[This gives Black a nice driving tesuji. No one likes to give the opponent a ponnuki but here I would attack with A, Black L16, White B]
;B[ld];W[ke];B[le];W[kf];B[mc];W[lf];B[jo]C[I think White can shut Black in on the upper side in sente now with something like shown in the variation.

I woul prefer Black A, avoiding to be enclosed and wait for a chance to do something wtih J16.]

(;W[gq]LB[lp:A]C[Locally I would prefer A. The Black attack is very strong now.]
;B[on]C[Good.];W[no];B[kq]
(;W[jp]LB[kp:A]C[Not good. The fighting move is A . I give one variation of the fight. Please work out the possibilities here by yourself.]
;B[kp];W[ko]C[Overplay...?

Natural move after K4. I think K4 is the mistake.];B[io]C[Now White is cut and has to decide what is worth defending.]
;W[kr];B[lr]
(;W[jr]LB[lo:A]C[Maybe here an aternative is White A (see var).]
;B[lo];W[kn];B[ln];W[km];B[mp]LB[go:A]C[Black has a won game now. Whites right group is eyeless and heavy and should not run now. Blacks only weak stones are JK5 so maybe White should jump to A.]

(;B[lm]LB[mr:A]C[L7 Group is important, but I cannot throw away The corner.

With Black A the White corner is caputered (see var).];W[me]
C[The game gets confused now.];B[lc];W[mq];B[kl]LB[lq:A]C[Black A is better.]

(;W[oc]C[White should connect his groups with A (see var). Losing L7 is bitter, but considering that White can buil influence at the top in sente it seems the best White can do.]
;B[nd];W[nf];B[nc];W[of]
(;B[jm]C[This is a  mistake by Black. He has to live at the upper side. The L7 group can do nothing. (see var)]

unluckily, That time  I can't save bothe sides.

I can't see what m1 does. One of the White groups is bound to die.]

Yes. The further white moves look like a desperate attempt to stage an upset.]

(;B[oo]LB[pd:C][dl:B][do:A]C[I think this variation woul have been the better choice for Black in this position. It builds influence in the center which fits with the Black position on the left. If White approaches at 'a' he will be pincered around 'b' to make the most of the star point in the upper left. In this case a fight develops from the bottom left to bottom right and P5 will be useful then. Moreover Black has the option of playing C, building influence in the center, which also would fit very nice with P5.]
