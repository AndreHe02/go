C[Thank you for reviewing this for me.

### np, should you need to contact me you can find me on KGS as Noxious or email preachingdismay@optonline.net


 I have a very difficult time defending(and enacting) invasions
 like those that were often played in this game. If you could give me some guidance as to what the right moves would have been, or where I could have invaded at, I would appreciate 

### When being invaded, one tatic that can be applied is to attack the invading stone.  Then, try and profit as much as possible from this attack.  

###When invading, try to figure out how you are going to make life or escape from the spot you are invading before you invade.  Also, if there is a equal or bigger building move, try to play it first.  That is to say build first, reduce later.

 Also, are there any books/other resources that might help me?

### The most useful resources I have found are :

www.gobase.org & www.goproblems.com

Free lessons from KGS members

Watching other memebers paid lessons from toxxicu
and paid lessons from toxxicu.  He is a excelent teacher & when I took lessons he taught at a very reasonable rate.  The fact that he also lets anyone watch his lessons for free is also a huge bonus.  Just be careful not say anything durning other people's  lessons as it usually a paid lesson. 

Thanks!

(;W[qe]C[### this is a mistake for white.  This move is used to limit black's eye space/attack the black stone.  Since it is a very open position there is nothing to really limit/attack.  Black happly replies @ q14 stealing whites good shape point and ends up stronger then if white just played o16.  See varation for a better response from w.]
;B[pf];W[md]C[### Whites play here it a little loose, n17 or o16 would have been better.]

(;B[qj]C[This seems like the standard joseki here. Are there variations?

### R10 or @ q10 would probably be best for you to play.  
If you mean varations on q16, r14  there are many.  To many to cover here.  gobase.org has a joseki dictionary that could give you insight as to some other possible varations.

As for this specific exchange, it favors black and would not be considered joseki.]

;W[mq]C[### Yes, you needed to extend before instead of playing q8.  There is no magic to get out of this situation, it's just a bad situation to be in.  It's best to try and avoid getting into situations like this at all.

This is the kind of invasion I run into a lot. I find the pincher fails me nearly everytime.]

(;B[kq]C[### this forces the white stone up, white is the oposite of what you want.  N5 would have been stonger.  (see variation)]

again I tried attacking the invasion, which obviously didn't work.]
