C[Hi,
In this game I am black. I was defeted by 54 points. Though it looks quite good until move 110. But from this point onwards I can't make good use of what I built up. Overall I think I should have played tenuki's more often, but I am not quite sure where and when. In the beginning I maybe should have built a stronger moyo at the top of the board.

It would be nice to get some comments and tips for improving my game. Thank you very much for taking your time for this!

> HAPPY TO REVIEW THIS FOR YOU.  I WILL  PUT MY COMMENTS IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS SO YOU CAN EASILY DIFFERENTIATE THEM.

SOME OF MY COMMENTS WILL SEEM SEVERE.  MY PURPOSE IS NOT TO CRITICIZE BUT TO DEMONSTRATE WHY A MORE CORRECT STYLE OF PLAY EARLY IN THE GAME IS A NECESSARY FOUNDATION.  WITHOUT IT, THINGS START GOING WRONG AND YOU ASK WHY.  BUT THE "WHY" OFTEN TRACES BACK TO A POINT MUCH, MUCH EARLIER THAN YOU WOULD THINK.  

FOR EXAMPLE, I DISAGREE THAT "IT LOOKS QUITE GOOD UNTIL MOVE 110".   BY THAT TIME YOU HAD LOST IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN THE TOP, THE CENTER AND THE LOWER LEFT CORNER AND SIDE (WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY INVADED).]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[co];B[qn]LB[dp:B][ec:A]MA[ql]C[not sure at his one

>YOU ARE RIGHT TO QUESTION THIS.  WHAT YOU PLAYED IS AN ATTACKING MOVE AND WHITE COULD HAVE REPLIED DECISIVELY WITH A PINCER AT X, FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH WOULD HELP WHITE AND HURT YOU.  

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS SECURE ONE OF YOUR CORNERS, SUCH AS BY PLAYING AT A.

ANOTHER POSSIBILITY MIGHT BE ATTACKING AT B, BUT A IS BETTER.]
;W[ro]
(;B[pj]LB[dp:B][ec:A]MA[ph][sl][pg][rn][ql]C[I wanted to secure R6. It would be better to play it at Q9 I think. Although it weakes the connection to the upper right corner.

>R6 WAS A WASTED STONE ANYWAY.  IT MAY HAVE SOME POTENTIAL TO LIVE, BUT NOT TO MAKE BIG TERRITORY.  

IF I WERE WHITE, I COULD ATTACK YOU ON THAT SIDE BY PLAYING AT ONE OF THE POINTS MARKED X.

THE POINT IS, THE EARLY PHASE OF THE GAME SHOULD BE (FOR BOTH PLAYERS) DEVOTED TO CLAIMING THE OUTLINES OF YOUR POTENTIAL TERRITORIES. THESE LITTLE BATTLES LIKE ON THE RIGHT SIDE ARE INSIGNIFICANT IN COMPARISON.]
;W[pm]
(;B[qm]LB[qf:A][qc:B]C[I wanted to save the connection to the top. I don't like this move, Q6 is maybe a little bit better. What should I do here?

>THIS IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN Q6.  IF YOU PLAYED Q6, WHITE WOULD PLAY HERE AND KILL BLACK'S STONES.  BECAUSE OF YOUR MOVE AND WHITE'S REPLY, WHITE LEAVES A CUTTING POINT THAT YOU EXPLOIT PRODUCTIVELY -- NOT BY SAVING THESE TWO STONES, BUT BY USING THEIR AJI TO STRENGTHEN YOUR FORMATION ABOVE THEM.

I TAKE EXCEPTION TO YOUR WISH TO "SAVE" THE CONNECTION TO THE TOP.  THERE IS (AT LEAST, NOT YET) NO CONNECTION TO SAVE.   TO HAVE SUCH A CONNECTION, BLACK MUST AT THE VERY LEAST PLAY AT A AND THEN WHITE CAN ALWAYS INVADE AT B.]

[ol]MA[qh][qg][si][pf]C[Here I wanted to cut the connection of the group to the left side. Maybe better O6/O7? Tenuki and making the upper moyo stronger?

>YOUR MOVE WAS OK, BUT LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.  FIRST, WHITE HAS NOT GAINED MUCH IN TERMS OF TERRITORY -- HE WAS GOING TO GET THAT ANYWAY -- BUT HE HAS MORE POWER THERE TO PROJECT TOWARD YOUR UPPER RIGHT CORNER BY INVADING AT ONE OF THE X POINTS.  SECOND, YOU ARE ON ON THE DEFENSIVE.  MOST OF YOUR MARKED STONES WILL PROBABLY SURVIVE BUT MAY NOT MAKE A LOT OF TERRITORY.  THIRD, YOU ARE NEGLECTING LARGER MOVES THAT COULD HELP YOU DEVELOP TERRITORY. I HAVE MENTIONED A AND B ALREADY.  LET ME MARK SOME OTHERS YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT (NOT ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO WORK, BUT THEY WOULD BE CANDIDATES).]

I THINK C COULD ALSO BE PLAYED AT THE POINT MARKED C1 AND, IN FACT, THAT MAY BE BETTER BECAUSE IT'S A LOWER MOVE (CLOSER TO THE EDGE), THUS HARDER FOR WHITE TO INVADE.  IF YOU PLAYED C1, WHITE WOULD PROBABLY ANSWER AT C AND THEN YOU COULD PLAY C2 AND BE ALL RIGHT.

CONSIDERING YOUR ACTUAL MOVE: TO ATTACK WHITE'S MARKED STONE, PLAYING AT X WOULD BE BETTER BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOUR STONES TO PROJECT SOME INFLUENCE TOWARD THE CENTER.  SEE VARIATION.]

LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.  IN THE TYPICAL GAME YOU WILL HAVE 2 CORNERS AND YOUR OPPONENT WILL HAVE 2.  SO THE QUESTION IS NOT WHO HAS THE MOST CORNERS.  IT'S WHOSE CORNERS ARE BIGGEST.  GO IS ABOUT TERRITORY.]

BUT ONE ADVANTAGE IS THAT BLACK, BY FIGHTING WITH WHITE, HAS BUILT A STRONG WALL FACING TOWARD THE CENTER.  YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLOIT THIS AS THE GAME PROGRESSES.

THE POINT IS THAT YOUR MARKED STONES WERE DOOMED ANYWAY.  WHITE WAS GOING TO GET THIS TERRITORY.  YOU CAN BE PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT ACCEPTING SUCH LOSSES IF YOU CAN COUNTERBALANCE THEM WITH STRONG PLAY OF YOUR OWN.
