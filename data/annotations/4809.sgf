AB[dp][pd]C[Hello, my name's Nathan and I will review this game for you.  One initial comment is that this seems to be a good game to send in for a review as you lost by a reasonable margin.  On the other hand, it is alot more productive if you send in the game with comments if at all possible.  As a reviewer I am simply another go player so I am not very skillful at assessing your grasp of concepts by your play.  I would be would be much more able to share specific advice if you pre-commented the game, and I think you would gain from rethinking and remembering what you were doing.  That way you will be more able to note where your thinking diverged from mine.  That's the way, in my opinion, that you will get the most out of the review process.  You don't have to annotate every move...just what you percieve as the key moments and the thought processes you were engaged in.  The moves you choose as important will in itself be illuminating.  It can also be helpful if you point out what you recognize clearly as blunders so I know which things are more valuable to discuss.  Don't worry if you  think your analyses won't seem accurate or something... reviewers understand that you are trying to learn.  With that said I will try to give you the best review that I can.]
;W[pq];B[cc];W[qo];B[mq]C[NA:  I don't know alot about joseki but my intuition says this is too close...The idea here is not to aproach white's shimari so closely as this will only result in exactly what you got, a pincer attack as a reply and a squeezed group with little potential for expansion which you will have to work to keep out of trouble.  I think a play around K3 might be more appropriate if you are wanting to check the expansion of whites territory here.  Especially in handicap games it's better to play more conservatively, you will generally lose if drawn into fighting situations.  One proverb that applies here is something like "don't approach strength too closely" or something like that.]
;W[jq];B[or];W[pr];B[kr];W[jr];B[ns];W[fq]C[NA: Here's a decent visual example of what I mean... compare the two groups.  Your group is tightly constrained by the white stones and you don't have any secure eyespace at this point.  A play at M2 by white will force you to run out into the center to live because he can either connect over, under, or by capturing your L2 stone (you might want to verify this for yourself if it's not immediately obvious).

On the other hand white has perfect shape...The standard rule for extensions is 1 space greater than the height of your wall.  White's wall at K2,3 is 2 stones high and the extension is 3 spaces.  Perfect.  On top of that the extension was a natural defensive reply to your moves, and at the same time threatens the corner, it thus accomplishes two things at once in good style.  That's the kind of efficiency that is very important in go.]
;B[cn]C[NA: Again I don't know much about joseki so this is just speculation but I feel this move is alittle weak as a reply because it doesn't really feel like it stabilizes the D4 stone, you will need to extend from this position anyway, but it's also passive.  This move should be more used as a territory taking move rather than a defensive move.  One option, though not guarenteed to be better just something to think about is a contact move like F4.  This doesn't have to be a fighting move.  You aren't trying to kill the white stones.  However, this move would necessitate a reply, which is taking control (sente) and then you have the option of extending up the side in a way which actually would secure you position like C or D 8 or 9, or taking the corner with a move like E3 depending on what white does.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[cp];W[br];B[bq];W[cr];B[er];W[eq];B[fr]
;W[gr];B[gq];W[fs];B[fp];W[es];B[ep];W[gp];B[hq]C[NA: This sequence is pretty on target for you.  I think the sacrifice of the two black stones to get thickness on the outside was a good idea and you  performed it well, so kudos on the basic idea.  Just a few quibbles on implementation.  
1) Notice that this proves my point about C6 it's totally a wasted move right now because it's clearly overconcentrated (too close to strength you already have) and doesn't secure you real eyespace, you will still have to extend.  The way I am imagining the F4 move I suggested  working out is similar to what you have accomplished here but without the wasted move and still on top (toward center) around F and G.
2) You should sacrifice both the G3 stone and the B3 stone.  This is not excessive.  You lose the G3 stone plus the H3 stone any way.  If you had played G5 instead you will still be in control on the outside, and be in a positin to make a HUGE extension up the left side.  White's position would be TINY by comparison.  Also, if white plays B4 (which is a tiny move) you simply play B5 in sente, white responds and you get on with your life having made two free moves basically.]
;W[hp];B[bp];W[jd];B[qj]C[NA: My impulse would be to check white from the right here, say at N17,  white would probably extend to something like F17 Then you could extend down the left side.  This means that you are getting white to make you make a move you want to make anyway.  Thus you are controlling the game.  Also notice that Whites position still wouldn't be secure because your approach stone would be below (closer to the edge) the K16 stone and so would still leave open attacking possibilities for you.]
;W[qf];B[rd];W[ql];B[mc];W[qc];B[qd]C[NA: I think most of these are overplays (excessively aggressive moves) by white and you handle them in natural ways, but also note that he's left alot of possibilities open which is exactly what white thrives on in handicap games, introducing unjustified complications.]
;W[dd];B[ec]C[NA: This is the beginning of some trouble for you.  Watch what happens...]
;W[dc];B[db];W[cd];B[bc];W[ed];B[fc];W[fd];B[bd];W[be];B[hc]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[ci];B[bj];W[bi];B[ck];W[cj];B[bk]C[NA: Ok, so maybe it would have been arrogant to think of the entire left side of the board as your territory, however, it clearly was one of the areas that you controlled influence wise but here white has effortlessly built a nice sized wall and potential territory inside it essentially with your cooperation...  Notice that if you had left your 3-3 stone to fend for itself, it would still have lived as the 3--3 invasion under a 4-4 stone is a standard procedure so you know you can give up one move in that situation since you were there first.  That's one of the advantages of the 3-3, it's so defensible.  So since what you end up with is pretty small compared with the possibilities you had on the left side you could have played down the left side from that initial white approach at 4-4 and thus made a move which would have forced white to reply to maintain the integrity of that stone, and at the same time defended your interests on the left side.  Again it's that kind of efficiency, combining multiple functions in one move that makes the winning edge in go alot of times.]
;W[oj];B[ph];W[qi];B[pi];W[qh];B[pj];W[pg];B[ri];W[rh];B[rk]
C[NA: These two moves aren't very helpful.  Notice that T11 still leaves you without an eye here but that if you had used either of these moves to jump to O12 (not O11) then you could have escaped probably.]

;W[fn];B[hj];W[hg];B[gf];W[ig];B[hl]C[NA:This is uneccessary, notice the situation before you make the move is basically what's called a "bamboo joint" which is four stones in two parallel lines of two seperated by one line.  That connection is unbreakable unless you let white make two move in a row there.  If white had played either g10 or f9 you would just play the other thus they are miai (two points that are strategically/tactically equivalent).  At this point in the end game it's getting easier to count the value of the moves and you should be searching the biggest moves available to you.  Moves should be counted as a point value plus a sente/gote evaluation, sente moves are obviously better by far, some insist that sente doubles the point value of moves.  This move is 1 point gote and is uneccessary as well.]

;W[qs];B[os];W[qr];B[js];W[is];B[ks];W[ir];B[gj]C[NA: Ok so good job with the incursion that runs from around f10 to j15, but also notice that though you reduce whites territory alot, white still gained the two areas to the left and right and you gained no territory.  Of course you can't prevent your opponent from getting any territory, you have to be reasonable, but this kind of trade is something to try to avoid putting yourself in the position of having to make, where your only option is to try to reduce a huge potential territory of your opponent without gaining anything in return.  If you are reducing your opponent and expanding your own territory at the same time that is the best possible result.

As for your general comments, remember that the center of the board is the worst place to try to make territory, that's true for the pro's as well.  In general, power in the center is dependent on making strong groups with alot of potential for expansion on the sides early in the game.  That's why beginners are taught the basic corner, side, center formulation for openings.  Much the same thing holds for "the best move"  We all search for that and there is no magic solution.

Ok, thanks for letting me comment your game.  Good luck.])
