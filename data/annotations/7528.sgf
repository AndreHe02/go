C[Dear reviewer, i appreciate a lot for your help :)
In this game i was black and i won by 13,5 pts, but still i did a lot of mistakes which i want to fix ^^
I used to be 4d long time ago but then i stopped playing and now i feel like ive a lot of missing points, lets call'em skills'holes :) would u help me to refreshe my mind? ;)
in this game i made many misscalculation mistakes and i dont rly have specific questions i just wanna know whats wrong with my play. >.<
thank you very much!];B[pd];W[dp];B[oq];W[dc];B[ce]C[reid: Black first played the 4-4 at Q16.  This move declares that black is not very interested in corner territory but instead wants to develop the top and right sides.  Next black plays P3 which declares that the right side is not important, but the bottom side is what he is most interested in.  And now black plays C15 to try to prevent white from taking the left side.

When you play this game, you should have a plan.  Black, with the first move advantage, usually guides the formation of the game during the first few moves with his plan while white is usually more reactive.  But here black seems to be reacting and changing plans with every move.]
;W[dh]C[here i wasnt sure which joseki i should've played, even because i dont remember them at all, so i played lightly but i think i made some mistakes with the continuation...

reid: Yes, the end result in this corner was very good for white.]

;B[ec];W[cc];B[de];W[eb];B[he];W[id];B[ie]C[reid: This is often seen in books as a classic mistake.  Black should avoid pushing white along the fourth line.]
;W[jd];B[hc]LB[fi:A]C[reid: I am not sure what black is expecting here, but he ends up helping white solidify his upper side territory (aji-keshi).  Black should save the aji he has here and instead attack the white F13 stones with A (F11)]
;W[hd];B[fc];W[gd];B[ge];W[fd];B[hh]LB[fi:A]C[reid: again, the key point for attack is A.]
;W[fi]C[reid: White gets the key point.];B[cn];W[cl];B[bj];W[fp]
;B[ch]LB[bh:A]C[reid: This move ends up getting cut off from the C15 stones.  A (B12) would connect easily.]
;W[cg]
(;B[bh]LB[dg:A]C[reid: Hmm, this is getting a little complicated, but instead of B12, perhaps black can connect if he starts with A (D13).  See variation for one possible sequence.]
;W[bg]C[reid: Black just kind of gives up here.];B[dg]C[reid: Too late...]
;W[df];B[eg];W[ef];B[eh];W[ei];B[di];W[fh];B[dh];W[cf];B[ff]
LB[be:B][ee:A]C[reid: Black needs to connect at A leaving B and F14 as miai.]
;W[ee];B[gj]C[reid: This is very bad for black.  We can remove six captured stones (D16) and six white stones (C17) and see that white has a huge corner while black has not even completely captured the four F11 stones.]
;W[dm]LB[ql:C][po:E][qo:A][qp:D][qq:B]C[reid: This is not a good idea for white.  We have just seen that white is ahead on territory because of his huge corner.  All white has to do is come out even on any future exchanges and he will win. Trying to save this stone that is already under severe pressure is asking for trouble.

White should probably simply invade at A inviting black to save the corner at B, then white can extend to C for a comfortable position.  The aji in the center will continue to be a problem for black.

White D would not be so good since black can then respond with E which works well with the center stones H12 and G10.  The center aji might just disappear this way.]
;B[fj];W[dn]C[reid: Black settles his aji issues, but the black can still live in the corner with C3, so this is not a good result for white.]
;B[cq]C[reid: The big area is still the lower right corner.  Black doesn't need to rush to live here.]
;W[dq];B[qp]C[reid: OK, black takes the big corner, but it would be better to not exchange C3 for D3 first.]
;W[qj]C[reid: If I were white, I would play C4 now to take back the bottom left corner, and trust that I could somehow invade whatever framework black makes with his next move.]
;B[qg];W[qm];B[cp];W[co]C[reid: Bad move for white - aji keshi.]
;B[bo];W[do];B[bm]C[reid: black is comfortable now.];W[jq]LB[mq:A]
C[reid: This is too timid for white.  The white wall is very strong, so white should go all the way to A.  White is falling behind.]
;B[lq];W[je]C[reid: sente? or aji keshi?];B[ig];W[nc];B[pc]
;W[ne];B[hq];W[ip];B[go];W[hp]LB[ho:C][gp:A][hp:B]C[reid: This cut does not work very well for white.  Perhaps better to go the other way, starting with A, black B white C.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[fq];W[gr];B[fr];W[hr];B[dr];W[fo]LB[gm:A]C[reid: This looks like bad trouble for white.  White should preserve the aji here 4 in order to save the D7 stones.  White could try A to see how black responds.  Black can't really atari at F5 because white E4 is sente.]
;B[gn];W[gl];B[in];W[ek];B[ej];W[il];B[kn]C[reid: White cannot attack these black stones effectively because of his own weakness.

At this point the game is pretty much decided.  White got the large upper left corner and upper side, but almost nothing on the rest of the board. Black has three fairly large corners pluse the significant capture in the center.

I think both players should focus on having a plan and making the stones you have work together.  I see many moves here that seem to have been made just because they were sente, but they didn't help move a plan forward.  Don't fall into the trap of thinking "It's sente, it must be good".  If it is not helping your plan, then it is could just be aji-keshi.

Good luck, play strong - reid];W[lp];B[fl];W[gm];B[hm];W[hl]
