AB[dp][pd][dd][pp]C[K>>Lost this game by alot, despite him giving me the full 4 stones.

P: Hi, I'm your reviewer. My Name is Pavel, I'm only 8 k at KGS. So don't consider my recommendations as absolute truth. My comments will be marked as P:]
;W[qf]
(;B[rd]C[P: Well, I don't think this move is good. First of all you have huge advantade of 4 handicap stones, so you should better think about attacking, rather than defending.

I'll try to explain the main idea of handicap game. As I understand it.
1. Black has advantage. I white will play ordinary - he will loose. So the only chance for white to win - is to frighten black, make him nervous, in order to make him err. Keep that in mind.
2. Don't use handicap stones for defending! Use them to attack.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[qk]C[K>>Here I feel like the stone at R14 should be assailable, but I'm not quite sure where how to do it.]

(;B[qh]C[P: This invasion is quite pointless. It leads to fighting. There are better places to invest your stone to get immediate profit. Be generous, let your opponent have some territory.]

[ao]C[K>> Thank you for taking the time to review this. Would love recommendations for books.

P: Well, most of the time you played quite consistent and solid, but very passive. Couple of times you played too risky, leaving cutting points, and creating weak groups.
The main reason of your defeat is the loss of the marked groups. Imagine them alive, and compare possible result.

As for books, consider reading of 
1. "How to Play Against Stronger Players" By Sakai Michiharu. 
2. "Get strong at handicap Go" by Richard Bosulich
3. "Kages Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go" By Toshiro Kageyama
These books should give you ideas how to use your advantage, when you play handicap game.

There is also series of good books about Go by Janice Kim and Jeong Soo-hyun. They are mainly about basic concepts of game, but they are written from korean point of view on the game of Go, which may be more easier to understand than classic japanese approach.
