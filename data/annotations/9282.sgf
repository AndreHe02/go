AB[pd][dp]C[DC: Hi, My name is Dylan Carter I am a UK 1d.

 I have reviewed this game and despite your strength not being far away from mine I think I can help. 

The key element I found was not so much to do with fuseki or fighting but principly from missing opportunities that can arrise during the game to seize the initiative in a simple and intuative way.

Go strategy boils down through the complexity of the seuquences to what is fundamentaly basic concepts i.e. splitting, leaning attacks, sacrifices and fast development. Our best games use these concepts and challenges our opponents with these plans, the best games come when we consistantly refute our opponents plans with upgraded ideas.]

(;B[eq];W[fr];B[cm];W[dl]C[Shall I play E2 now ?
DC: Maybe you need to step up to larger strategic thinking. F6 is fine for now but there is no need to help white with C7 and E3 which leave defects.]

DC: Your game is only lacking in a strategic plan of attack, thus you may be defeating yourself before you have created an idea, a good strategic idea comes forms with an interesting and fruitful attack plan. The strategy can be simple in concept i.e. spliting groups.  When we split groups they don't grow in strength fast and so we may be able to maintain the balance of the game.]
