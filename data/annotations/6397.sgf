C[Dear reviewer,

I had black in this on KGS and lost by resignation. The game took many turns or at least that's how it seems to me. So I'm quite curious at which point you think I lost it. I wouldn't be surprised at all if it comes down to a critique of my fuseki, since I'm having many problems with that in general.

Llywelyn: This was an interesting game to review.  Black won most of the ko (of which there were several), but still lost the game.  Some thoughts that may help:

* Don't get caught up in local fights. Look to see how attacking another group can help you in this fight, or tenuki and leave it for later.   Even a dead group is worth ko threats, and trying to save a dead group can end up losing a game that could still easily be won.

* Focus on strong shapes, especially when your own groups are weak.

* Look for dual-purpose moves.   There were a few points in this game (most critically M19) where Black's moves seemed very focused in their purpose, and Black would have been better off trying to make his moves do several things at once.

Hopefully this helps.  Let me know if you have any questions ^_^]

(;B[mq]LB[qj:A][jp:B]C[Llywelyn: 

A few regions of the board draw my eye.

There are a few really important regions on the board right now.

A - This area works with Q6 and forms a double-wing with K17.

B - Allows white to form a double wing with D10.

N3 feels like it is prompting White to play along the south side to put pressure on B's group when B extends to K3.  For this reason I would be tempted to make a move around F3 or F4 first, just to try and put some pressure on W's framework.

That having been said: this move does work out pretty well if black has the right followup.]
;W[no]
(;B[jq];W[hq];B[lo]C[Hoping to pressurize w group.

Llywelyn: I like the thought, though W can play R3 before jumping out, and make B's group feel a lot weaker.  This is also a weak shape, and B's group is already too weak to be thinking in these terms. 

I would play the kick at Q3 first, and then jump out at K5.  That gives the double-threat of going after O5 or diving in to F3.]
;W[nm];B[pl];W[ho]LB[oq:A][hr:B]C[Llywelyn: I  might attempt to stabilize my black group now at either A or B.  H5 is devistating since it makes N3 a weak group and when W chases, assuming P4 survives (seems likely) it will probably give W the SW quadrant of the board.]

With L&D the importance is on reading.  Can you read a way to kill?  There are 30 minutes of thinking time in this game, take it and look through all of the possibilities.]

Llywelyn: Trying to save this group with moves that do not work in many respects cost B the game. 

If you can't see a way to save the group, try playing elsewhere.   You may find a way to save it later, or a ko may come up and you can use the threats to save it to your advantage.  I've marked a few moves I  might consider instead.]
