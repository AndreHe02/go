C[kkiretu: Hi!

I was playing White in this game, i think the early game was going good but things got complicated when i tried to hard to kill white group on the bottom right corner, which result in a black counter-attack. The game was probably lost at that moment but white started playing too passive and allowed me to catch in the end game...

The victory was actually a surprise to me. I would appreciate if you could comment on my moves and where i could had done better. Thank you in advance.


Hi, My name's Daniel, I'm playing on kgs as Stevenson [2k\]

Okey here some basic principles you should work on:

1.Look at the whole board. Don't play yose moves in the middle of the game.

2.In the Go game there are only two types of moves, urgent moves or large moves. An urgent move means you must help your stone or group become settled or comfortable (or punish your opponent's stone or group that is not settled or uncomfortable). You can see if something is uncomfortable by imagining enemy stones coming close to it with effect. If no urgent move is required, then take the largest move.

3.If you really want to lose a game just go for the kill. That is the fastest way to lose.

4.Play from your weakness (or weak group). If you start a fight without defending your weaknesses you will always lose in fights. (That's what happened in the game).

5.Learn some basic joseki. Don't memorize the moves. Understand the best you can why each move is made in a joseki. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the game.


The end of review.
I hope it will be useful for you. Good luck!];B[pd]C[MagmaFires: hi]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk]LB[nc:C][jp:A][mp:B]C[B is playing high chinese fuseki. The most common respones for w: A, B and C.
The idea of high chinese fuseki is to build moyo and if b gets a stone around A he builds a nice framework.

So I would prefer not to let b play his game and play A instead of shimari.]

(;W[ce];B[jp];W[qf]LB[nc:A]C[Not so sure about this move, i considered K17 at the time, but didnt want black to take the whole right side wihout resistance.



Usually r14 is played when b has a stone around k17. As a common principle you should make a kakari from the open side.

k17 looks a bit slow for me (b doesnt have to respond to it) that's why I would play A.]
;B[qe]
(;W[qc]C[This move is strange. If you wanted to take corner you dont have to play r14 stone, directly 3-3, but the trade will be good for b as he's playing moyo oriented game.]
;B[rd]C[S16 seemed strange to me at the time.


The whole variant is not common. But s16 is a shape move in this situation.]

;W[kd];B[ke];W[je];B[hc]C[Here i felt the invasion was too deep into my territory and didnt want Black to settle a base easily.

In fact b doesnt need this invasion he should have just continued building moyo.
Now you got a chance to attack weak b group and while attacking it to invade b's moyo.]

Yes, bad shape. S18 is slow, it's a yose move. A and B look like urgent moves otherwise b might defend his moyo.]

(;W[re]C[This sequence seems a bit like spoiling aji as i didnt gained much from it.


Again yose move. Look at the whole board, invasion is a must now.]
;B[qd];W[sd];B[rf];W[se];B[sc];W[sb];B[qg];W[qo]C[Since i had sente i decided to try to invade as black seemed to have more territory than i had. I also considered something like G3 instead.


G3 is slow and low in moyo game usually you want to play high moves around h4.
But invasion is urgent. So r5 is a very good move.];B[qp]C[Common pattern see the variation.]

;B[or]C[I usually see my opponents play p1 to make eyes here and with s3 open i thought i could kill the group... since this is a major turning point in the game... is it possible to kill black or i should had played something like M3 or n6?

Firstly you dont need to kill b. When you go for kill, you take all the risks. So I would think of reducing b's moyo instead.

It looks like b has enough space to make eyes. I dont see how you can kill it. Besides you have cut at n3 and because of k4 stone ladder doesnt work.]

Yes, very painful move, that because you went for a kill, now it looks impossible to save both groups.]
;W[lr];B[lq];W[kr];B[kq];W[jr];B[ms]C[After N1 i dont think i can approach the lower group anymore and both my groups were at danger. I played N4 to save what i could.


The feature of the corner that it dies very slwoly so any Semeai is good for b. n1 doesnt give b an eye.]
