C[Hello! I am Bernd Sambale, HonFu in the ladder and on KGS, where this game was played in August 2007.

Later in the match my opponent started invasions, which put me severely behind in territory, and if I hadn't been able to kill the large group in the upper right - which probably he could have prevented -, I would have lost big. What were my mistakes, and how could I have prevented the game from sliding out of my hands?

Thank you for your help, dear reviewer!];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd]
;B[jd]LB[oq:A]C[A is better, especially because of the development direction of the white stone on D4]
;W[np];B[oq];W[op];B[pp];W[nq];B[or];W[jp];B[nr]C[Seems to be a bit slow. But, on the other hand, a White move here would be big.]
;W[dj];B[lq]C[But this definitely feels too early.];W[lp];B[kq]
;W[kp];B[mn]C[Not a good move.];W[mq]LB[jq:A]C[Bad shape, better left unplayed. I'd want to play A (K3).
A good gote move is preferable over a bad sente move.];B[mr]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[qk]LB[hc:A][jq:B]C[Now for the next White move A (H17) and B (K3) come to mind. In both cases W should have an easy game.]
;W[qm]C[But this starts a fight where you don't really want it.]
;B[pn];W[pl];B[pk];W[nl];B[oo]TR[mn][mq]C[Now the marked Black stone (N4) isn't ridiculous anymore! This is due to your premature invasion as well as the bad shape move N3.]
;W[ok];B[qh]C[Such moves always throw me off balance. It is a) daring and original, b) perhaps a bad overplay and c) can lead to either of the two players losing quickly.
The variation gives what I believe to be a refutation of this move.]

(;W[rh]C[Not the sharpest, but nothing wrong with this either]
;B[pi];W[ph];B[qj];W[ri];B[oi];W[og];B[oh]C[Doing W a favor]
;W[qg];B[rl]LB[rm:A]C[Accomplishes nothing. Better to keep the option of playing at A (an eye in gote)]
;W[rm];B[mh];W[lk];B[om];W[ol];B[kn];W[ng];B[mj];W[lm];B[ln]
;W[jq]C[These were some good moves from both sides. W is still happy, especially now that he has got K3.]
;B[mg];W[il];B[jl];W[jk];B[kl];W[kk];B[ll];W[mk];B[ik]C[Black's last few moves were not effective, in so far as that W played "outside" and B "inside". But the cut presents W with a difficult problem.]

(;W[ij]C[The proverb tells us not to atari the cutting stone. But it is left to us to decide when the proverb applies! 
I think it applies here, though. See variation.];B[hk];W[ji]
;B[hm]C[This outcome is unsatisfactory for White. Black now has a firm foothold in White's part of the board.]
;W[gq];B[cp];W[cq]C[Correct, White can not expect any territory on the outside.]
;B[co];W[bq];B[cl];W[bk];B[do];W[ep];B[hp];W[hq];B[fn]C[White lost some ground here; but I believe he is still slightly better because of the weakness of Black's right side group.]
;W[gi];B[fc];W[dc]LB[eb:A]C[A has the same idea but puts more pressure on Black.]
;B[dh];W[ei]LB[cf:A][dc:B]C[White seems to be afraid of a single Black stone! Like a woman afraid of a mouse :)
This must really be at A, if only to save the honor of White's stone at B]
;B[ce];W[bd];B[bi];W[ci]C[Pushing into the knight's move is bad (another proverb, applying really well here)]
;B[ch];W[bj];B[di];W[ek];B[cj];W[ck]C[All very humiliating. But if you lie down by your own choice, you can expect to be trodden under foot.]
;B[eh];W[fi];B[be];W[ee];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb];B[ad];W[ab]
C[The easy part of reviewing is having hindsight. So, with hindsight, where did all White's (prospective) territory go?
Please look at my remarks in the preceding few moves as an attempt to answer that question.]
;B[gd];W[eb];B[fb]LB[me:A]C[For the last two moves, Black is being too greedy.
The Black moves do seem plausible, since he is harrassing White's corner. But still, defending his last weakness (at A) should take priority.]
;W[kd]C[Excellent move! The White thickness (the group stretching over the middle, and the group on the right) becomes effective.]
;B[kc];W[lc]
(;B[jc]C[Black already has to be very careful, see var.]
(;W[ld]TR[kd][lc]C[This makes it slightly too easy for B. White should treat the marked stones lightly, and attack the Black group on the right side. See var.]
;B[me];W[kf];B[lf];W[je];B[kg];W[jg];B[hc]C[Irrelevant, B will not die here anyway. Meanwhile the upper right is still unstable.]
;W[rc];B[hj]C[Another coffee break move];W[hi];B[ih];W[ii];B[jh]
;W[kh];B[lg];W[ig]C[B must have misread the ladder. Apart from the damage to his position, this is a psychological blow from which he will not recover (at least, not in this game)]
;B[gf];W[hh]
(;B[no]C[High time to defend the upper right!
The variation shows that B has a sente seki in the upper left. Not very relevant now, but just so you know :)]
;W[nd]C[Excellent!
Still the vital point. Black is now quite lost because he has a) lost time (2 full moves!) and b) strengthened White]
;B[md];W[mc];B[ne];W[od];B[oe];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb];B[pc];W[nc]
;B[qe];W[re];B[rb];W[sb];B[qa]C[Black has connected, but only to find that the big group cannot live.]

;W[rn]CR[kd][lc][nd]TR[ei][qm][mq][ij][ci]C[Dear Bernd,

This was an interesting game to review, and quite well-played I believe.
Here I indicated your dubious moves by a triangle, and your game-winning ones by a circle.
The bad moves are 
- a bad-shape move (N3)
- a premature invasion (R7)
- a mishandling of the central fight (J10)
- a panicky move (E11)
- another bad shape move (C11)
I cannot find a common denominator for your mistakes (always assuming that I am right, which may or may not be true).
Your handling of the final fight, on the whole, deserves praise!

Hope this is of some use to you,
jantje])
