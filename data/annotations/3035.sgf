Dear Wong:

My name is Barry and I am rated ~ 9k on KGS and ~14k on IGS under the name "bconwil".   Please keep in mind that my suggestions and comments may help in some ways, but the advice is only as good as my rank...  I will mark my comments with  *.

If you have any questions about the review or other games you wish me to comment on, feel free to contact me at bconwil@aol.com.

Overall, your played a very good game apart from a few moves that allowed your opponent to seize the advantage.  I was impressed with your beginning game and feel for the direction of play.  Some your moves were a little passive, but it it something easily corrected when you gain some confidence in how to attack your opponents weak spots.

As far the opening (fuseki) goes, one of the best pieces of general advice I can offer is from a book I recently read.  The book Five Hundred and One Opening Problems gives the following general questions you should answer when deciding your move in the opening stages of a game..

1.  Is there an urgent move?
     a.  One that makes a base for your stone.
     b.  One that takes away the base of your opponent's stones.
     c.   One that takes the initiative in a certain area.

2.  Is there a big move? 
    a.  One that extends from your own position.
    b.  One that prevents an extension by your opponent.
    c.  One that threatens an invasion.
    d.  One that prevents an invasion.

3.   Is there a big moyo?
    a.  Do you need to expand or close off your moyo?
    b.  Do you need to erase or invade your opponents moyo?


and remember the motto: "Play urgent points before big points."


Try to make your moves dual purpose, such as extending your territory while attacking.  Also,  If there is a move that is gote that you have to make,  try to make some sente moves before relinquishing control.

"sente"- a move to which your opponent must respond 
"gote"- a move to which you opponent can ignore and play elsewhere.]

You could solidify this by making the moves in the variation.

Summary of Comments:

I think you played better game than the score indicated.  You have a good feeling for the beginning game for someone who has not played very long.  I would recommend that you focus on trying to make moves that have a dual purpose, such as extending your territory while making your opponent respond.  Your opponent seemed to control the pace of the game.

Also, study some life and death problems.  That will be very beneficial for you at this stage.  Just one move in a life or death situation can easily win or lose the game.

You did a good job.  If you have any questions please feel free to email me.  Perhaps I'll see you online sometime and we could plkay a game.
