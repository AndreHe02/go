AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hi, I play black and I believe I lost by 6.5 points or so. I'm not really knowledgeable to comment on my own game so I don't know what to ask for, but I do know I need to work on life an death problems.

If you could in general point out mistakes in my play I would appreciate it.

Thanks.];W[pp];B[cj];W[dm];B[hq]C[This looks odd - too far away to secure
the corner.  Gi ven c10, C5 would be the
logical next step.];W[co];B[cp];W[do];B[bl]C[This move looks weird to me, but I wanted to limit the amount of points gained as much as possible.]

(SGF) blueGhost 17k?: hi

Up to the point of the corner invasion
and Ko, the play was pretty reasonable
overall.   Black really botched the defence,
but that only counts are 1 major error.

Black makes too many pointless hane
to surround moves, leaving many unnecessary weaknesses.])
