I think the weakest part of my game is early game.  I have trouble picking appropriate joseki, and usually I have to play the whole middle game and end game already behind the opponent in strength.

Thank you very much for reviewing my game, I look forward to hearing back from you!

MR: Hi Alex, 

I agree with you that "the direction of play" is one of the points of your play that you should work on. Sometimes it appears that you choose a joseki "because you know it" or "because you like it" and not because it fits in the whole board situation well for you. If you want to read a go book in the next time, I would recommend "The Great Joseki Debate" to you to get a feeling on the results of different josekis in a given situation.

Monika];B[pd]C[sycomore [2k\]: hi :)
sycomore [2k\]: hf];W[dp];B[pp];W[ed];B[cn]C[MR: Most people would prevent a shimari in the upper left corner - the most common approach would be C16. Of course, you should have seen at least some josekis for this situtation before the game (see Ishida). 
Another alternative would be to extend your own area with Q10 or F3.]
;W[fq]
(;B[dj]C[I've just started using this joseki, I could use some pointers on using it.  When is it appropriate to use?

MR: The most important point is that after B C6 and D10, C12 is a key point for White. Therefore, choosing this joseki needs to be seen in relation to the upper left corner. If the corner is black, especially with a black stone on 4x4, this joseki feels fine. If the corner is white, white is very often anyway eager to play an extension on the left edge, so W C12 becomes double meaning for white, which is of course good for white. 
In this situation, the joseki given in the variation, ending with a flat but secure black group, seems preferable.]
;W[ch]
(;B[cd]C[MR: An alternative for an invasion under the 5x4 point is invading at 3x3. The josekis starting with the invasion at 3x3 tend to be less complicated than the josekis starting with the invation at 3x4. See Ishida for some joseki variations.]
;W[ce];B[dd]C[MR: B15 would be an alternative.];W[de];B[ec]
;W[fc]
(;B[fd]C[MR: Black is "wanting too much".];W[ee];B[fb];W[gc]
;B[db];W[gb]C[Should I have responded here?
MR: The black corner group is encircled by white walls anyway. Therefore, you should read whether the black group lives as it is, and if so tenuki is a good option.]
;B[pj]C[MR: This move should have better been played *before* strengthening white in the upper left corner ...]
;W[fa];B[bd];W[eb];B[dc];W[be];B[bb];W[cl]C[MR: This is a very good move by white, as white got strong in the upper left (while black just established a small group there). Compare this with black having stones at B4 and C9 instead of D10!]

(;B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[cj];B[cq]C[MR: Again, black is "wanting too much". If you want to invade the corner, do this *before* exchanging D8 etc.! If you start with securing your group, you should continue securing your group, e.g. with E6.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[er]C[MR: Now your stones around D8 are very weak.]
;W[dm];B[em];W[dn];B[lc]C[MR: Ok, treating the stones around D8 as "forcing moves" is an option. 
In relation to the upper right corner, this move should be at N17.]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[MR: Questionable. I think that just answering at Q6 is fine.]
;W[qq]C[MR: White's joseki choice is also questionable here, as the standard joseki that follows is good for black here.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo];W[qf]

(;B[nj]C[MR: Why not play the normal "9 stone handicap joseki"?]
;W[mg];B[jj];W[le]C[MR: ?
White should settle his group with R10.];B[jd];W[lj]
(;B[lk]C[MR: What is your plan here? 
Neither spending white a ponuki in the middle of your area of influence nor allowing white to cut your center group apart appear to be good options to me.]
;W[kk]
(;B[ll];W[mj];B[nk];W[kj]C[MR: The result of the last few moves is bad for black - the white group is strengthened and the black center group is cut apart.]
;B[nh]C[MR: Too late.];W[mh];B[ng];W[nf];B[mi]C[MR: What are you doing? You are making zero points while further strengthening the white group. You should better look for your own center group!]

MR: Yes, the bottom black group is safe, if you answer E1 with B1 instead of C2 (see later).]
;W[fr];B[di]C[For this move, 101, I had sente and was deciding between a few moves, R11, D11, j3, and s15, which was most important?

MR: Securing your center group is fine. The other moves mentioned are also large, but will not help you win the game if white can kill your center group.]

Also, how should i have responded to E1?

MR: With respect to the white group - do not think but read!
It should be not too difficult for you to find out that white is alive if he playse C14! Therefore, you could try to read whether B C14 kills the white group. 

With respect to the lower black group, B1 should do.];B[cr]
