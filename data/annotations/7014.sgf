C[W:
Hello!
My name is Wojtek and I played as black in this game. This game turned into a large fight and I think the result has been decided by it, but I has some doubts in the opening. I marked my comments and questions with `W:` at the beginning. Please correct my mistaken moves, reasoning and conclusions.

Thank you!

inimino: Hi Wojtek, I have made my remarks throughout.

Some of your questions are about fuseki, which I find abstract and hard to reason about and is probably the weakest part of my game.  So I will be mostly commenting on the fighting, which seems to be where this game was won and lost.

In general, after reviewing the game, my overall thoughts about your style is that you avoid fighting, and so when the fighting starts you may have less well-developed fighting instincts, which puts you at a disadvantage in complicated games, compared to a player such as myself who is bad at fuseki and overly aggressive and nearly always ends games with big fights.

You made a lot of very cautious moves, and play very solidly in general, but I think if you can be a little more aggressive you may end with more fighting in your games and so you will get better at it and become a stronger player.]

;B[mf]C[inimino: Strangely, this move seems a little slow.  White may play here, but if so seems to lack a convincing follow-up.

D3, or somewhere on the bottom side or around the upper left corner would be my tendencies, seeming bigger than this.]
;W[nn]LB[qm:A]C[W: I don't know what to think about this move. Surely it makes white stronger and reduces a lot of potential. I guess A is a strong follow-up as well, but it feels strange - I would extend along the side, but maybe I'm too orthodox :-)

inimino: Probably for the same reasons as my comments on the previous move, I would prefer the extension as well.]
;B[dq]LB[pm:A][om:B][nk:C]C[W: I didn't know how to play on the right side. I would like to reinforce at A or B, but that doesn't look efficent. C, on the other hand seems a little bit too close (but I am not sure about this one at all).

inimino: I don't know either what to do on the right side, but I would either play at A or B, or tenuki.  Given the large open board at this point, I will almost certainly tenuki, probably to D3 as you did.]
;W[cj]C[inimino: White should play on the bottom side, this move seems quite obviously wrong compared to the K3 area.]
;B[iq]TR[rr][qr][pq][np][nn]LB[lq:A]C[W: I guess K3 is the usual move, but I felt that It would be a bit too close. I'm not sure how to judge w's marked group. During the game I felt that I should be able to attack this group, because white played S2. However It was quite hard to decide how (or even if) to do it. Both P2 and P3 seemed like vital points. In the end I decided to play J3, because A seems a good follow up.]
;W[kq]C[W: On the other hand, this w move seems very nice.]
;B[io]LB[cl:A]C[W: This seemed to be pretty big, since it makes me stronger, but white started reducing my moyo right away, so I'm not sure about this move. A seems important, yet it's a bit close...

inimino: A seems to be a much better shape.  Is it any closer than J5?  It puts pressure on C10 as well, which w may feel compelled to respond to.]
;W[cm]LB[ic:A]C[W: This is pretty painful, but I felt I would have a hard if white played around A, so played tenuki.]
;B[fc];W[df]
(;B[jc]LB[lc:A][rb:B]C[W: Today, I believe this is a mistake. White seems to be safe, since A and B are more or less miai.

inimino: It is too far from the w group to be a real threat, but too far from the F17 stone to be safe without adding another move, so I agree that this is wrong.  D18 or J17 would seem to be better choices.]
;W[lc];B[db];W[cc];B[hd]C[W: I like this shape :) However, I'm not sure if w couldn't have played more severely...]
;W[go];B[gq]C[inimino: This seems a little too slow.  Perhaps J7 or E7 instead?  B can also aim at N3 and/or P3 by attacking G5.]
;W[cp]
(;B[co]C[W: At this moment perhaps I got greedy. I felt that if I played simply D4 I would lose everything, so I tried to play more actively. On the other hand, maybe I should take sente and do some building in the center? See var.

inimino: This doesn't seem greedy to me, but normal.  I agree that you should not play passively here after you added so many stones in this part of the board.]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[cn];W[dp];B[ep];W[bm];B[an];W[eo]C[W: Now black is in trouble...

inimino: Why not simply C3 here?  See variation.  Perhaps I am missing something but I see nothing for w in the corner here.]

(;B[br]C[inimino: This move seems like it might be necessary, but in that case D2 should have been at C3 which settles the issue with sente for black.]
;W[er];B[bq];W[gm];B[fl]C[inimino: This seems to be moving out on the wrong side, the J3 group is weak but this is not helping it, and there seems to be no real danger of white making a lot of territory here or connecting just yet.

Perhaps I would prefer something like J7 or L5.];W[gl];B[fk]

;B[im];W[il];B[hj]LB[ol:A]C[W: This move is very agressive, but white is pretty weak. I thought that if I played something around A, I would lose the chance to attack . I hoped that w would escape, and then I would be able to play on the right in sente, making both territory and connecting.

inimino: To make territory by connecting here I think it would be better to chase w from the other side, e.g. L10, and then after w runs away or makes life you can try to close around A and hope to make a large territory.]
;W[pm];B[qm]C[inimino: Rather than answer Q7 immediately, I will play now at L10.  Once w has dealt with the threat to his larger group, you may come back to the Q5 stones and deal with them in the most appropriate way given the situation in the center at that time (e.g. perhaps you decide to sacrifice them to close off a 60+ points center).]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[ql];B[rm];W[pl];B[rl];W[pk];B[qj];W[pj];B[lj]
TR[om]C[W: w counter-attacked, so I felt that I had to capture w's group on the left or cut at the marked place.]
;W[nl]C[inimino: This is very painful for white.  Really it seems that all your thick play has paid off and there is a very high chance to kill the large w group now.]

(;B[kj]C[inimino: I would peep at H9 first just to simplify things a bit.]

(;B[jj]LB[fm:A][gk:B]C[W: Maybe I should have defended the cutting points at A and B...

inimino: It seems to be OK, but in this position I will probably look to play J11 first.  This helps both against w escaping and against the cut somewhat.  Your moves of F11 looks quite good also.]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[fj]
(;B[ik]C[W: This is very wrong :(  This game was played with canadian byouyoumi, which was a bit new to me. I guess I didn't use my time in the right way - My conclusion now is that J9 wasn't needed at all. I included some variations I considered when I wrote these comments.

inimino: Yes, this is a strange move under time pressure.  After this point it does seem to be difficult to find successful moves for b to deal with cuts on the left.  I was not able to find any better result than ko after this move.

I would probably play F11 here, and then if w extends, D8.  However the variations you show also seem reasonable.]
