C[I am black: 1k in Hong Kong.

White is chuli 1d* from LGS, and he is 3d at Tiwan according to him.

This is the first time i win lgs 1d*. But it is  not an easy game at all!

Although there was a big mistake madeby white at the upper right corner, but soon after i found out that the territory of white is very big.

Thank you for your review and comment for my game.];B[pd];W[dp]

;W[qg]LB[rd:A][rj:B]C[I have never seen this methode of invasion in professional match, why?

If you look at the game it is clearly hard for W to make eyes here, allowing B to make the upper right corner a big territory. I think it is much easier to settle a stone played at R16 and then reduce the moyou from the outside. However, what W is thinking is that A and B are miai. It's difficult to call it a bad move.]

A B C and D are all 1/2 eyes, so it seems W is alive. But only because R14 is sente. Otherwise R12  or P12 would remove two half eyes.]
