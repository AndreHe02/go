;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[fc];W[ec]C[//This move isn't as good right now.]
(;B[fe];W[fd]LB[df:A]C[//This is a little early. white should jump at A instead and wait to see if he wants to wedge in like now, or jump in around h17.]
;B[gd];W[ed];B[gc]C[//This is ok];W[df]LB[ge:A]C[//Could cut at A also.]
;B[fg];W[qf]C[GoGareth: Played tenuki instead of extending L side: worried about influence of black's developing wall if I do

//This is ok.];B[qh];W[qd]LB[nc:C][qc:B][of:A]C[//I would prefer to jump out or go into the corner or double approach at C.  The move played is usually used when white just wants his stone to live.]
;B[pe];W[pc];B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[rc];B[qg];W[od]C[//This was good spirit, you don't need to save r14.]
;B[nf];W[md];B[kc];W[lc]C[//You don't need this.  The territory is small on top so better to take a larger move elsewhere.]
;B[qn];W[np];B[lq];W[lp]C[GoGareth: opted to cap black.  worried B will develop massive central moyo otherwise

//When you attach to a stone like this, you will make the other stone strong as well, so you are giving power and influence as well.]
;B[kq]LB[kp:A]C[//Hane at A is better];W[kp];B[jp];W[cn];B[cl]
;W[cj]LB[en:A][cq:B][fq:C]C[//Counter pincering here is not so good, you should move the A stone by jumping, going into the corner or reapproaching.]
;B[el];W[dh]C[//This move is slow.];B[fi]C[//This move is interesting, but i'm not sure what else to say about it.]
;W[en];B[fp];W[gn];B[jn];W[dl]LB[bl:A]C[GoGareth: Wedged as worried about the isolated 3 stone group in LL. Intention was to connect and capture/isolate C8 to gain territory.

//Instead, you should try to attach under at A instead of wedging.]

(;B[co];W[cm]
(;B[eo];W[em];B[do];W[fl]C[GoGareth: Worried about the cut off group at E6 etc.  Spent a long time reading out the ladder (broken by Black F11) and decided the cutting stone could be captured with a geta and loose ladder to the left side despite F11 but misread!!]
;B[ek];W[fj];B[ej];W[dj];B[ei];W[bl]
(;B[fk]C[//This isn't as good.];W[kd]C[GoGareth: Tenuki as I had no good answer to F9 locally.  Intention was to decrease B central influence.]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[id];W[ie];B[hd];W[gf];B[ge];W[ff];B[gk];W[gj]
C[GoGareth: Extending as ladder works in my favour but black plays a ladder breaker so run out to 78.]
;B[jf];W[hj]C[//Running these stones inside black's influence doesn't seem like a good idea. I wouldn't try it.]
;B[hk];W[ij]C[GoGareth: Attempting to build a wall facing my weak wall on upper side.  Aware I may be giving away most of the LL quarter though...]

C[GoGareth: B's group @G9 etc is looking temptingly isolated and I attempt to surround it aiming to build strenght by attacking and threatening to capture  Aware of weakness of enclosed W group @E6 etc.]
;B[hm];W[il];B[gm];W[im];B[in];W[hn]C[GoGareth: Probably an overplay looking at it now.  I have shortage of liberties here when trying to capture the black group above.  May have been better to tenuki.  Maybe L7 to connect  to W Bottom R corner?]
;B[fn];W[pm]C[GoGareth: Attempting to create a territory with the central wall]
;B[pn];W[qm]C[//This move is typical bad shape, letting black hane at the head of two stones.]
;B[om];W[pk];B[ol];W[ok];B[mk]C[GoGareth: N9 cuts me off in the centre so I am playing for life here to move 112.]

;B[oj]
(;W[ja]C[GoGareth: I think I've read out that this us a killable group (bulky 5) if I hane both sides but I misplayed/misread and allowed black to play the critical point at H18. I worried playing at H18 that B would hane out and creat 2 eyes against the top side...

;B[cp];W[dq]C[GoGareth: I read out lots of ways of living in this corner but hadn't anticipated B b2...  Is there a way of living? that would have swung the game my way.  Even seki would have been enough.  I couldn't find it.
