C[Hello and thank you for giving my review. Throughout the game I would like to know the kinds of things that you would be thinking about, and what I should be thinking about at certain points of the game.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[qd];W[cp];B[ep];W[eo]C[
This would be a perfect opportunity for a pincer + extension around G4 to J4.  It is the way to make efficient use of your Q4 stone.

If you already know this, ask yourself why you are getting so creative.

creativity is good and necessary in the middle game, but the opening is a place where you should play conservatively. This means doing what you already know works.]
;B[fo]
(;W[en]C[

Is this a good response? I felt like playing D5 but wasn't sure how to punish an overplay if black tried E6


-------

This is a strange direction...  what is your goal?  Where is the territory you are attempting to create/control?  

Q4 wants you to control the lower side.  But if you wanted to do that, you should have played the pincer to E4.]
;B[dp];W[co]C[
Okay, so you're  claiming the left side.

Not so great with D16 glaring at you from above.

locally this is a good response to D4, but the global sense of direction is off.  Q4 is not happy about this direction of play.]
;B[fn]C[Not sure if this was a good move? Am I so weak that he can push like this?]
;W[em];B[jq]C[Correct length for B?

---------

Not bad.  White can't really cut at F4 and expect any kind of good result.

probe at G4 might give some good leverage to reduce though.

Your Q4 stone looks quite pathetic by  now, and it will probably get worse.

You should have made the pincer.];W[ci]C[Correct length for W?

------

No complaints about the length.

You're driving this car with very nice accuracy and precision, right off the cliff.  Where are you going?

There is no realistic opportunity for large profit on the left side becuase of D16.  There is no ... future here.]
;B[cg]C[
I might be tempted to ignore this.  

Look at the cut in the tenuki branch...]
(;W[od]C[
Good for you!  I was afraid you would respond to C13.

This is every bit as good as my tenuki.];B[oe];W[ne];B[pe];W[nd]
;B[qj];W[jd]C[Correct Length?

-------


Yes, from two, three.];B[hc]C[I feel like there are 3 strong Black groups Versus 2 Strong W groups and 1 weak white group. What do you think? I thought that i was open on the bottom and was about to lose plenty points in my O16 - K16 group


----


Your assessment of the strength of groups is correct.  

I will stop the review here, because the game is lost.

Black has plenty of opportunity for expansion on right and bottom sides while slowly moving into the center.

White has no real opportunity for expansion.  The only way to win is for Black to make a ridiculous error and let a large group die.  

1) you made Q4, your hugely important (FIRST MOVE!) completely irrelevant by not developing it.

The pincer to E4 was crucial.

2) You chose a terrible direction of play for your left group.  

Sometimes, there's really no way to recover from early mistakes, especially when they are compounded by more mistakes.

Star point stones should always be developed - the first moves you make must not be allowed to become strategically irrelevant.  Make them count!

Regards, I enjoyed reviewing your game.];W[hd];B[gd];W[he];B[ic]

This cut is irresistible.  I haven't read out the result at all - but the shape is such that he can't get a very good result out of it.]
