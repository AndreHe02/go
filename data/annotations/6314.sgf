RE[W+7.5]

C[Hello Andy,

I reviewed your game, please note that I am 7 kyu on dragon go server, so I can give you a few hints but my strenght is close to your opponent.

In general, considering the gap in your rating and that of your opponent, you played a very good game.

One thing that would help you improve is to pay more attention to making a base for your stones and taking away your opponent's base. I commented with examples in the game.

Another important point is to attack with more of a purpose to make territory instead of trying to kill your oppnent's group. Again, please see specific examples in my comments of the game.

I hope my advice is useful and will help you improve and enjoy the game.

C[P: Please note that it is more standard for white (joseki) to play at A]
;B[ed]LB[ck:A]C[P: This move is too soon, extending at A is better for black for 2 reasons: 1) it creates a stable group and gives black a base as well as 2) helps to make future territory.

Basic idea: extend by 3 spaces with a 2 stone wall.];W[qg];B[qe]
;W[pj];B[nc];W[jc]
(;B[je]LB[gc:A][hc:B]C[P: a black move at A or B  is preferable.

First, you take away white's chance to make a base for his stones. White A stabilises his group and threatens to take away black territory in the corner.

Second, by taking away white's base with black A you force white to escape in the midlle. You can then keep attacking white (see variation) while making a moyo.

Basic idea: attack the opponent by stealing his base.];W[hd]
;B[fc];W[ld];B[me];W[jd];B[ke];W[ie];B[kd];W[fe]C[P: white is escaping in your potential area of territory, try to avoid this unless you are thick and very strong (not the case here).]

;B[gc];W[dj];B[dg];W[dm];B[fo]LB[ck:A][ep:B]C[P: this is why black at A was suggested earlier.

Black B is probably better as you can limit the influence on the white group in the lower left by trying to seal it in.]
;W[jq];B[fh]C[P: interesting splitting attack];W[hg];B[ci]C[P: this is good, you make territory on the upper left while threatening the white stones.

Basic idea: attacking while making territory.];W[cj];B[dl];W[cl]
;B[el];W[cm];B[em];W[bi];B[ch];W[bn];B[bo]C[P: nice splitting move by black, absolutely necessary.]
;W[gq];B[gg];W[hf];B[ic];W[id];B[jg];W[ih];B[jh];W[ii]C[P: Unfortunately for black white can escape while splitting your groups. Killing this group is not easy.]

;B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[qn];B[ql];W[po];B[pl];W[rj];B[nm]C[P: good shape move.]
;W[ko];B[ej];W[dk]LB[bh:A][ek:B]C[P: Black A is a good endgame move in this area, you close off your corner territory while theatening the life of the white stones.

More territory for black than black at B.

But the black has made nice profit in the upper left.]))
(;B[gc]C[Variation];W[je];B[hf];W[me];B[dj]C[P: this is a simple variation where black can start an attack on white. white tries to connect to his stones on the right but black makes a huge framework on the left.

Furthermore, white's stones are not yet completely safe. It is unlikely that you could kill white, but black can come back to attack later and make more territory.]
