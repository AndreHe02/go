Hi Midori, 
I'm Laurent L. [lorl\] (2k KGS)
my comments are followed by : (LL)];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
;B[oc]LB[qn:B][po:A]
(;W[po]C[good move

(midori)

no, this move is the correct one.
(LL)];B[nq]LB[pj:B][qj:A]
(;W[qj]C[this also seems kind of "passive", especially...

I don't think so. this move is perfeclly playable in this situation.
(LL)];B[qh]LB[dj:B][oj:A]C[... once black plays this. and I'm not happy about my next move either, because...
(midori)]
(;W[oj]C[this move is possible, but I would prefer to take the initiative, now -- see variation --
(LL)];B[oh]LB[ic:B][jc:A][dj:C]C[... while it is true that my group in the P-R-area is relatively strong now, black's group looks even stronger now.
second problem: after that move I'm not sure where to play next. one rule of thumb, at least so I've been told, is to look for "weak groups" and play somewhere there. but at this point I can't identify any particularly weak groups, so I thought playing into a large area would be a good idea, but I'm not sure if I chose the right direction.
(midori)

your group on the right has a good shape and is totally safe.
of course, black's group is also strong and has more perspective of development, but this is normal... remember that black made the first move of the game and was the first on this side !
so, the overall situation looks as even.
there is no weak group.
white has 'sente' and has to continue with a 'big move'.
two directions are interesting, now :
- the upper side which is the natural direction of black's future development (white can aim at A or B),
- the left side where white can develop a 'moyo' (white C seems to be the biggest point on the board).
(LL)];W[jc]TR[ic][dj]C["direction of play" is a fairly advanced concept, at least for me. the main reason why I played k17 at that point was to play a "multi-purpose"-move. to me it looked like a "large point", it develops the top, although, somewhat loosely, and it reduces black's own development on the top.
looking at it now though, black still has other moves on the M-line available to him, so playing somewhere else might've been a better idea overall? perhaps something like d10?
(midori)

as explained before, this direction is good to counter black's development. as a sligh improvement, I would prefer to play one intersection back in J17, which I find easier to make a shape with white position on the left.
as I also said before, I feel that D10 is the biggest move on the board, and personnaly I would play there.
you seems to have the same analysis as me ;-)
(LL)];B[fq]TR[lc][cj][cn]SQ[nq]C[in fact, this move is not a good idea... "Square" stone at O3 is a stronghold by itself, but is in a low position, so this side doesn't permit a quick development.
M17, C6 or C10 are surely better.
(LL)]
(;W[eq]TR[cn]C[this is a standard-joseki, one of the very few I actually know, however, in this particular situation, with black being so strong in the lower right corner, a pincer might've been better?
(midori)

no !!! this is the first real mistake by white...
this move is not good as it reinforces black and helps him developing this side.
the standard answer in C6 is good -- see variation --
this time, your analysis is also a mistake : as black is strong in the lower right corner, you should avoid playing near this force. a pincer would create a weak white group and would help black attacking you !!!
(LL)];B[fp]C[black is happy beeing forced to play this move.
(LL)];W[dn];B[jq]TR[fc][mc][cf][ck]SQ[jp]C[this is particularly troublesome now.
(midori)

yes, but this side is flat and not so big : it would have been better to play this move on K4.
despite everything, the 'sente' is for white, now... and there are still many big points to play...
(LL)];W[cg]TR[cf]C[too slow?
(midori)

this is not really "slow", but I don't like this move as the corner is still open.
in a similar idea, I like C14.
(LL)];B[cl]LB[cj:A][cm:B]
(;W[cj]C[no, you can't play this move as you have to defend your corner.
(LL)];B[co]C[of course, this move is annoying for white.

;B[no]LB[mc:B][pg:A]C[the result is good for black
(LL)]
(;W[pg]C[the main reason why I think I played something like this was my fear that I may be already behind, even though that is not necessarily the case!? to me it looks like black is leading in both, territory and influence, so I was trying to split the two groups in the corner.
(midori)

you are too pessimistic in your commentaries since the beginning of the game : 
white doesn't need such play and should just continue to make points...
(LL)];B[ph];W[pd];B[pc];W[oe]C[this seemed like a bad idea, or at least for the splitting-plan, since it allowed black to connect the two groups.
(midori)

I agree that this is a bad idea...

(;W[mf]C[I suppose I managed to reduce it at least? but I'm not sure about the efficiency of n14.
(midori)

this move is not good : it doesn't make points and creates a weak group which will become a target for black.
(LL)];B[mc]C[good timing for black : he makes points while threatening to cut white.
(LL)];W[ld]C[of course, you have to connect, but you lose 'sente'...

(LL)];B[jb]C[with this move, black is already connected.
(LL)];W[kc];B[kb]LB[lb:A][fk:B]
(;W[lb]C[no, it obviously doesn't work !!!
white should take 'sente' and play elsewhere...
(LL)];B[lc];W[nc]TR[fk]C[no... white has to play elsewhere : I still propose F9.
(LL)];B[nb];W[nd];B[mb];W[md]C[not only didn't that work, but it also ended in gote, not good.
(midori)

yes : this looks like the losing sequence in the game :-(
(LL)];B[fe]C[instead of M18 and the moves that followed, I should've played F15 myself I guess.
(midori)

this could have been a possibility, or F9 as said previouly.
(LL)];W[mp]TR[fk][nm]C[another move based on the fear that I may be behind, especially after a move like f15.
(midori)

this move is doubtful : you should first play at the frontier like F9 or O7.

yes, you several times feel late, while you where not so bad globally.
so you play doubtful moves which lose points and 'sente' which is even worse... 
if you calmly just take points, you would probably won the game.
