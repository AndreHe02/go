DrPepper: It is too far from the enclosure and carries no threat to connect under, so it is a pretty bad move on those counts.]
;W[qq];B[pp]C[This is not joseki but I dont see it as a bad move

DrPepper: In almost all respects, playing into a "hane at the head of two" shape is bad, unless there are distinct tactical reasons to.]

TR[ql]C[Now this B stone is far too close to thickness. It should be at R11.]
;W[qj];B[ol];W[on];B[no];W[rr]LB[rl:A][rr:B]C[DrPepper: "A" and "B" are two things to consider for this group's second eye, so I'm not sure this is such an urgent place to play. Staying ahead at O7 is considerable, as is simply playing R13.]
;B[pr];W[oj];B[nn];W[qg];B[ld];W[hq]C[This I think is bad because I played near the force. I think d10 would be better

DrPepper: You should reduce the effectiveness of black's thickness from a distance, but normally one plays either F3 or G3 to do this. As happens in the game, the three space extension requires defense.

The point of the play down here for white is to ruin the bottom side. By playing this looser extension, you turn black's approach into a move that has a distinct tactical followup.]
;B[jq]LB[fq:A]C[DrPepper: At this point in the game, I don't think this is sente. If you want to forestall black "A", try white D10. If he invades, your thickness is working well, if not, then you have a chance to fix your shape later. In either case, D10 is very valuable, as it is the last big fuseki point.]
;W[ho];B[fp];W[eq]LB[fq:A]C[DrPepper: Why not just "A", simply?]

(;W[mk]LB[ok:A]C[DrPepper: I would prefer to cut at "A" and keep my groups linked. The proverb "cut the side you don't want" applies in cases where your opponent has play in either case. Here, your opponent has nothing if you cut at "A", and it links your groups, so it seems best to me.]
;B[ok];W[ll]C[DrPepper: This increases the value of your cutting stones, but hurts your right side two-space extension group.]
;B[im]
(;W[hm]LB[gn:A]C[DrPepper: don't touch weak stones if you don't have to. Unfortunately you cannot lean on the F4 group, so I think just moving out diagonally here is good.

Secondly, it is worth asking, are these center cutting stones more valuable than black's cutting stones at O9? It is hard for me to say, but I would prefer a firm capture at O10. Black will enclose your cutting stones, probably, giving you the opportunity to fix your corner. See the variation.]
;B[nj];W[mj]LB[hm:A]C[I think I've been lucky, but I think I haven't  played correctly

DrPepper: did the contact play "A" carry a specific threat? If not, it is a sign that it wasn't a good move. If so, then it is a sign that N10 is not a good move.]

(;W[kk]C[DrPepper: This is a thin move, leaving black to push through your knight move ("split shape"). See variation.]
;B[hl];W[gm];B[jl];W[en]C[DrPepper: Enclosing a live group in gote is not good, so all you've done is link some stones up. That may seem ok, but while there is action against black's center group, you should keep pressing, and try to help this group in the flow of that fight.]

;W[ce];B[dh];W[fc]LB[ce:A]C[DrPepper: I will ask again, because it is a question you should ask yourself a lot-- is this contact move "A" a move with a specific threat? If so, then F17 is a bad move; if not, then "A" was a bad move.]

;W[cn]C[Even playing very solid like this, white is doing fine.

Think about the sequences that led to this. Black made thickness in the lower right, giving you the corner. But now that thickness is doing nothing. To my eyes, black is dead locally, and requires another move.]
