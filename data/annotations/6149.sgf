Artie [4k\]: I'm all about the free candy

[MAFU\]
Hello! I'm very happy that you like to review this game. I (4k) played black against Artie, 4k. It was a fun game for me.

I had no special plans for the fuseki. I managed to come into chuban with an advantage. The game developed without any fights. His position became hopeless in yose, so he resigned.

Please point out my mistakes (do not hold back ^_^). I'm especially interested in joseki choices and direction of play in fuseki and chuban. Thank you very much!

Jay: Glad to help. I will comment on both sides.];B[pd]C[Artie [4k\]: enjoy!]
;W[dp]C[mafutrct [4k\]: hehe =)];B[qp];W[op]C[[MAFU\]
preventing mini chinese. i'm actually very fine with that, since i don't really get mini chinese yet :)]
;B[cd]C[[MAFU\]
empty corner seems biggest now

Jay: It seems fine. But, D16 is more natural to counter the W's influence to be build underside. But, who knows ...]
;W[qq]C[Jay: W should play outside, to take advantage of B's upper position.]
;B[rq];W[pq];B[ro];W[ed]C[[MAFU\]
unusual move, i didn't expect this
is there a way to attack the P4 group right now?
or is there just bad aji against white in the lower right?
is answering locally biggest? if so, where?

Jay: Well, the LR corner is not finished. But, you were the one to tenuki first. I think this W move is very good, given the LL high position D4 stone, W is not affraid of a fight on lower side.]
;B[gc]C[[MAFU\]
i do not really understand this black move.
what is the purpose of this kind of pincer? when is this move played usually?

Jay: I see this move is good to play current situation.];W[ce]
C[[MAFU\]
this is wierd

Jay: Agree.];B[be];W[cf]C[[MAFU\]
somehow resembles a joseki... but this seems to be too easy for black]
;B[dd]C[[MAFU\]
is this move ok?

Jay: Not bad. W screwed up here.]
(;W[ef];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc]C[[MAFU\]
white has still some aji and black got a big, secure corner and is not enclosed]
;W[nc]C[[MAFU\]
wierd. the top is small. i expected white to play on the left or bottom

Jay: Approaching the other side is normal.];B[qf]C[[MAFU\]
is this the correct answer?

Jay: Sure.];W[pb]
(;B[pj]C[[MAFU\]
r17 seemed kind of small
this move also was a preparation for something around n3

Jay: This move is a bit strange.];W[rc]C[[MAFU\]
why is this move usually played at r17?

Jay: Yes. This is not standard. You did not play standard either the previous move.]
;B[cn]C[[MAFU\]
is this the biggest area to play?

Jay: I would prepare to attack the W's LR corner, there are unfinished business there. So, approaching from the other side is better.]

Jay: OK, Playable.];B[er];W[fp];B[gq];W[gp]

i read the sequence up to M2 and decided that this will give black the best position. was my judgement correct? or should black play an other move here?

Jay: My feeling is that N4 is better to prepare attack of H5 stones. It is not realistic to kill the P3 group.]
;W[mp]C[Jay: Now, W's groups are almost safe.];B[lp];W[lo];B[mo]
;W[np];B[ko];W[ln];B[kn];W[lq];B[kp];W[lr]C[Jay: This is not bad for W.]
;B[lm];W[fm];B[hm]C[[MAFU\]
is h6 better?]
(;W[kc]C[[MAFU\]
who is leading by how many points now?

Jay: First of all, this W move is slow. The game is not settled yet. So, it is hard to estimate. But, let's have a try. I read W has 60 solid pts. on the board. B Has about 45 solid points on board plus a moyo on the right and center. I would say B is leading somewhat because of the moyo. This is why this W's move at L17 is slow.]
;B[kr];W[nr];B[kq];W[ms]C[[MAFU\]
is n6 biggest now for black?

Jay: Pretty big.];B[ff]C[[MAFU\]

mistake?];W[qg];B[rh];W[qe];B[pf];W[pe];B[oe]C[[MAFU\]
this move seemed possible since white must defend the r15 stones before he can cut later.]
;W[of];B[pg];W[og];B[ph];W[od];B[ne];W[mg];B[qd]C[Artie [4k\]: yeah, saw that too late

[MAFU\]
white seems doomed now
there was nothing very interesting after this point, you do not have to review more. thank you very much so far :)]

white resigned here.

The framework turned out to become a huge amount of cash, so black's win seems inevitable.

Again, thank you very much for reviewing :)])
