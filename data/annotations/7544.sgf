C[Jan:

Hi reviewer,

Thanks for reviewing my game.

I ("PeatMan") played as black in this game. It was played on 17-november 2009 on IGS.

This game I won, but only because at the end my opponent made a great mistake by not seeing that a large group was in atari.

I added my own comments to give you some indication on what to comment on.
(My real name is Jan by the way.)

RickMott (RM): Hi, Jan.  This was an interesting game, and I appreciate the effort you put into commenting it yourself first.  I've done some fairly extensive variations for you as well.

Basically, you did OK until it came time to make use of your left-side wall.  Then you had a fundamental misconception.  Influence (walls and outside strength) are best used for fighting and not for making territory directly.  You make territory later by forcing your opponent to defend in unfavorable conditions.

You got in trouble by letting white live too easily at the top, and by letting him break out into your potential moyo.  That was your main strategic error.  Then you got back in the game when white let you cut through the right side and take a bigger territory than he should have allowed.

Unfortunately, you made some bad calls in the middle game, and the result was basically decided by move 140 (ignoring white's endgame blunder).

Using influence well is one of the most difficult aspects of the game.  You tend not to trust your fighting ability when you have a strong position, so you need to work on some tesuji problems and gain a better understanding of how fighting works to improve your game.  If you like books, there's a series called "The Art of xxxxx" which I've found useful, and particularly "The Art of Connecting Stones" might help you.  Good luck!]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[pp];B[do];W[dm]C[RickMott:  This seems like an odd play by white.  A high pincer doesn't seem to make sense, but we'll see how things develop.]
;B[cp]C[Jan:
Deviation from what one might expect from black: F5.
I think it was better for white now to try to seal me in.

RickMott: Actually, I'm not sure the jump to F5 is necessarily best.  I'd be tempted not to commit to a direction yet, and make a solid descent to C5.  Then wait to see what white does.  Even tenuki might be OK.  This pincer isn't a very severe attack; white's continuation is not so clear.  You can complete the upper-left shimari, or make a Chinese-opening pattern at J17 or J16, and it might be bigger than a local response here.]
;W[cq];B[fo]C[RickMott: Black is separated, but he was separated before the whole sequence.  What are your stones here doing for you?  They don't have a base, and you don't have an attack going yet.  That's why I suggested tenuki after the original pincer, then defend as needed.]
;W[fq];B[ho]C[RickMott: The only way to make these stones valuable now is to use them for attacking.  I think you should pincer the D7 stone first.  Consider the difference between a black vs. a white stone around C10 or D10.  Huge, right?  It's the difference between the white stone being on the run, with a nice extension from your upper-left stone, and the white stone having a base from which to put pressure on your running group.]
;W[ck]C[RickMott: See what I mean?  Now the center-left is much less valuable for you.]
;B[ch]C[RickMott: White is now strong enough to fight here.  If the black stone was on the 10th line, it would be much harder.]
;W[bi]C[RickMott: This is small.  White can run or make a base, so he shouldn't do either yet.  Lots of bigger points on the board.]
;B[ci]C[Jan:
Blocking would have been better. But maybe that's because I did not play my wall-strategy so well.

RickMott: Actually, playing elsewhere is better still.  The top and the right side are wide open.  None of your groups are threatened, and you can't make much of an attack on the three white stones here.  So leave it and plant your flag  in the top center or right side.]
;W[bh]C[Jan:

My strategy was to let him have a small area along the side while building a wall and make a large mojo with it.

RickMott: Ok, but the problem is you may end in gote and then white will be able to make an invasion at the top because it's so wide open.  That will limit your moyo.

You would be better off to ignore this area, which will not be big for either side, and grab a big top point.  White can still invade somewhere, but you should be able to make more territory by attacking the invading stones.

One of the hardest things for me to learn was that walls are good for influence in fighting, not for making territory.  They are actually quite inefficient for making territory directly, because they use so many stones.  Think of it as filling in all the end-game border points between territories right at the start.]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[cf];W[bf]
(;B[fc]LB[fc:A]C[Jan:
I was afraid he would cut me at C15 and cause a lot of trouble. That's why I wanted the stone A to be closeby. I was in a hurry to make a move in this area before he would.

RickMott: There's no cut at C15.  See variation.  You should play this stone high and in the middle of the upper side.]
;W[be];B[ce]C[RickMott: Certainly at this point, you should ignore this and reinforce your top side.   The previous move was a mistake by White.   Even if white pushes and cuts, and you sacrifice the C16 stone, white will get maybe 10 points in the corner while you get 30 on the top.]
;W[cj]C[Jan:

This move was not nescessary, I think.

RM: Yes, and you really, really want to reinforce the top now.]
;B[ei]LB[jd:A][pj:B]C[Jan:

I think this is a bad move. I was trying to protect the area after my wall.
Around "A" would be better, and -after some more thinking- around "B" would be even better than that.

RM: No, you were right the first time.  A is fine, or even L16.   The move you played was worth very little.]
;W[jc]C[Jan:

An invasion around here could be expected. If I had a stone around Q10 and attacking from the right would make a nice mojo.

RM: You can still do that, of course.];B[mc]C[Jan:

Let's push from the right (the weakest side) anyway.

RM: This is correct.  Push white toward your strength.];W[gb]
C[RM: This is a very odd move.  Normally white would jump out.]
(;B[gc]C[RickMott:  This way, you force white to link up and live.  It's playable, but you're hanging everything on keeping the big center moyo you haven't completed yet.  If you lose sente and white gets a big reducing move in, you're toast.  See the variation for a simple alternative.]
;W[fb]C[RM: This is a mistake.  You have to separate white and fight.]
(;B[hc]C[RM: No, this lets white connect and live.  Repeat after me: *use a wall to fight*.   See variation.]
;W[hb]C[Jan:

Same strategy as on the left: Building a large mojo, now between two walls, while keeping white low.

RM: The moyo isn't going to be that big anymore, unfortunately.]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[db]TR[fc][gc][hc][ic]C[Jan:

Was this a good move? I had bad dreams of beeing cut around E17 and loosing the marked stones eventually.

RM: No, it's a bad idea.  Once you commit to making the top moyo this way, you must prevent White from poking into it.  K16 is the only move.  The marked stones have four liberties and a huge wall on the left; no way can they be captured.  Even if they are, it's only 8 points!  If you make enough on the outside, you still win.]
;W[jd];B[ie]C[Jan:

To close if i wanted to protect my area. H15 was better.
My strategy does not seem to yield that much profit.

RM: Yes, this move doesn't do much.  Maybe better alternatives are: (a) take the big side point at Q10, (b) attack white's eye space with a peep at L18.  Then he as to worry about living, and maybe you can make some territory while attacking him.]
;W[ec]C[Jan:

Aha: The feared move!

RM: Nothing to worry about.  You have the strength of the wall to work with.]
;B[eb]C[RM: The cut is correct.];W[dc];B[cc]C[RM: Two liberties to four, no problem.]
;W[id];B[ge];W[hd];B[gd]LB[fe:A]C[Jan:
"A" would make better a shape, I think.

 RM: Yes.];W[he];B[qf]C[Jan:

I think my area between the walls is more or less wasted, but I'm alive.
This move seales the corner. (Does it? At least he did not try...)
R13 would be too far and invite 3-3 invasion. R15 would be definitely secure but too slow in my opinion.

RM: This is too slow, too. You really need to jump down to Q10.  Sure, white can invade, but you will become stronger on the outside if he does and that will support an approach to the lower right corner later.  Besides, the peep at L18 is still there; white's top group doesn't have two eyes yet.]
;W[gf];B[ed];W[if];B[qm]LB[qn:A]C[Jan:

Same comment as move 47 (=R14)
Maybe the standard approuch at "A"  was better. In case of a pincer I would be able to get the corner.

RM: I think A would be more playable, yes.];W[qi];B[qp]C[RM: Not contact, I think.  Since the pincer is so wide and puts , I think the approach from below at O3 might be interesting.  Making a contact play gives white control of the direction of fighting.]
;W[qq];B[qo];W[rq];B[po]C[RM: Your group is strong enough without this push, which just makes white stronger on the bottom.

Consider a peep at P3 instead, followed by an extension to M3 after white connects?  That would pretty much destroy white's bottom territory.]
;W[op];B[pk]LB[jq:A]C[Jan:
Attack the white single stone and strengthen my own group...
At some point I have to invade around "A".

RM: This stone is your target, yes; how to attack is the question.  How about a shoulder hit from above at Q12?  What does white do?  If he pushes up, you make more territory for your upper-right moyo.]
;W[oi];B[og];W[mi];B[oo]C[RM: This is called "pushing from behind", i.e. white is always ahead of you and making strength on the bottom.  It's usually bad.

If you want to invade the bottom, do it now.];W[np]C[Jan:

Looks slow.

RM: I'd be happy with white now, marching along the 4th line while your group above looks overconcentrated.]
;B[iq]
(;W[fm]LB[fm:A][gp:B]C[Jan:
Strange move. This group is alive and does not need reenforcement according to me.
I would have done: (seen variation)

RM: I would have played L3 and been delighted with the situation at the bottom.   This is a double-value area, because L3 is good for white and M3 is good for black.  Playing first here is worth a lot.]
;B[lq]C[RM: Good move!];W[no];B[nm]C[RM: You can hane here also.]
(;W[go]LB[eo:A][go:A]C[Jan:
I don't see the point of cutting here.
I am connected. A cut at "A"  would be more dangerous. See variation.]
;B[gp];W[gn];B[fp]
(;W[gq]LB[dp:B][gq:A]C[Jan:
D4 would be better.

RM: White has to worry about life, too.];B[hq];W[dp];B[cn]
(;W[cm]LB[cm:A][eo:B]C[Jan:
Would a cut at E5 have worked?
(see variation)

RM: Yes.  Your variation is wrong; black's cutting stones are in atari at move 85,  You have to connect, and white can fix up his cutting points.

You should probably have connected at B with the previous move.  You give up C4, but you'll get a good reduction of white's territory in sente for it.]
;B[ep];W[bp];B[co];W[eq];B[bo]C[RM: Small.  M6 looks nice by comparison.]
;W[bq];B[im]C[RM: I like the other side (M6) better.  If white M5 now, you get very little and he can separate your group on the lower right side.]
;W[ef]C[Jan:
Black should tenuki?

RM: Yes.  M6 for sure now.]
(;B[ee]LB[kb:B][ee:A]C[Jan:
Was this nescessary?
(variation)

RM: No, you're very strong.  No worries.  B is good, though.]
;W[le];B[me];W[ld];B[md];W[mf];B[nf];W[mg]
(;B[ii]C[Jan:
He gets a too large mojo in the center. I thought I could  connect to either J7 or F11. He probably could have cut, but he did not.

RM: White's center area will be small because it's open on two sides, from your left wall and your bottom stones.  You should take the last chance to prevent a connection for the three stones on the 11th line.  See variation.]
;W[gi];B[ik];W[mq];B[lp];W[mm];B[nl];W[nn];B[on];W[ml];B[nh]
C[RM: May be too late now, with white stronger below.];W[ni]
(;B[pi]C[Jan:

I was trying to cut off R11

RM: Then you shouldn't have forced white to connect at O11 first.  If you play O12, you must follow through with the push and fight sequence starting with N12.]
;W[ph];B[pj];W[oh];B[qh]
(;W[pg]LB[pg:A][qg:B]C[RM: Yes, you were lucky here.  White could have done much more damage.]
;B[qg];W[pf];B[pe];W[oe];B[ne];W[of];B[od]C[Jan:

This was nice for black I think

RM: Yes, but it relied on not the best play by white.  At this point, you are ahead and should strive to simplify the situation.]
;W[ng]C[RM: Small move.];B[gk]C[RM: Wasted move.  This neither makes territory for you nor takes it away from white.  M6 is big,  L18 is sente.]
;W[sn]LB[mg:C][gk:B][hn:E][in:D][rp:A]TR[ii][ik][im]C[Jan:
Should I have done "A" instead of "B"?
I have the feeling the marked stones would have been cut off now because the wall "C" is in place. If I was afraid of cutting "D" or "E" would be better than "B"?

RM: White has no chance to cut off these stones.  B was not needed.  Yes, this monkey jump cost you a lot of points, so A would have been a big end-game play, but you have some bigger sente (L18) even now.]
(;B[so]C[RM:  The usual way to handle a monkey jump is to play on top at S6.  See variation.]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[sp];B[sm];W[rp];B[kb];W[jb];B[ek]C[Jan:
I was thinking about eating G11 or more.

RM: You owe a move to finish the sequence at the top.  White can clamp you at M18 and you can't escape.  You should play M17 first.]
;W[el];B[hg];W[gg];B[hf]LB[hf:D][hg:A][hh:E][kh:C][gi:B]C[Jan:
Bad move. He can keep me at pressure. See continuation.
Maybe "A" was not such a good idea in the first place if wanted to catch "B". Or was catching "B" not a good idea and should i have gone in the direction of  around "C"?
"E" Instead of "D" would have worked I think: Threathen to cut at G12 or still at H14

I was still ahead before move 130, I think. But the continuation was bad for black as i played it.

RM: Yes, 'E' would have been fine.  White must connect at D or lose all his stones.  M6 is still very big, too, because it has double value (white L6 reduces you by a lot).]
;W[hh];B[ig];W[ih];B[jg];W[jh]TR[hf][hg][ig][jg]C[Jan:

Bad. I should have let him catch the marked group a few moves before. Now he gets everything: his stones connected and the area where the marked stones are.
Making a bad move is not smart but holding on to that move is even worse.

RM: Good analysis.  Now you just have to get in the habit of doing it before you play... :)]
;B[gj]C[Jan:
I felt I had to defend my connection.

RM: Not necessary.  You can connect two ways (to your wall and to the bottom group), so wait for white to force you.  You get a couple of points from this move, but M6 is bigger.  So is B16, which is gote but worth about 10 points to prevent a white monkey jump to A18.

In the end game, you have to evaluate the size of all the possible moves, and sente is extremely important.  A rough rule of thumb is that a sente move is as good as a gote move that gets twice as many points.]
;W[hi]

It was my plan to take the liberties of the marked stones, but that seems a stupid plan. I could not expect him not to see that.

It gets even worse..];B[mb];W[ka];B[eg]LB[ma:A]C[Jan:

My opponent resigned after this. Although my stupid plan worked in the end, it feels somewhat unsatisfactory to win a game like I did here.

I had the game won for some time but I made stupid mistakes around A, B and C. Around D it went quite well, I think.

RM: Yes, you should have been comfortably ahead after your successful fight to take a big right side (which you should remember only happened because of some mistakes by White) by around move 120.  But the first point at which you lost control of the game was very early, when you let white break into your upper moyo.]

Your wall is not as effective as you'd like, but it stll has power if you get to strengthen your cutting stones with J14.  There's still the possibility of a bigger moyo, depending on white's choices.  The key is to get the big right-side move first, so you have to play there as soon as you give up sente at the top.]
