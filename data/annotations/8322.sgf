C[C:

This is a game I played against a 7k on KGS. I am currently 11k. I think I can improve this ranking a lot with some effort. I would really like to figure out the areas I most need to improve.

J:

Hi Conor,

My name is Jan. I play on KGS as PeatMan (5k) and I will be your reviewer. My comments are indicated by "J:".

My standard disclaimer: 
Bear in mind I'm only 5th kyu on KGS. That means that my comments may not always reflect the best advice, but it's the best I can give.

There's a summary at the end.];B[pp]C[
S: 

I always start in very simple ways.

J:

Good idea.];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[qm]LB[cj:E][qj:D][jq:C][cf:B]
[qf:A]C[C:

Is this ok? Is it too far?

J:

It is unusual.

Usually one plays an approach move towards one of the white corner stones from the direction of the friendly black corner stones: A or B.
Also around C would be a common (and good) move. 
I think around D or E would also be good enough.  It claims a lot of area. Personally I like the third line for solidness, but the fourth line may also be good.

I think with your move you'd like to claim a lot of area and also try to secure the corner. The move is too insecure to prevent the corner from being invaded and for a mojo it is too slow to my taste.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[bp];B[cq];W[ck]C[J:

Following joseki.];B[qf];W[hq];B[kq]C[J:

Good. Put pressure on him. But be aware that the group D4 can be in danger at some point if it is closed in. Beware of it's eyespace. Playing inside the D4-group may become a good tesuji for white later on. You can prevent this at some point by playing B3, but I think that's too early for now.]
;W[qh]C[J:

White likes to create weak groups. Try to take advantage.
It is a good idea to focus on his weak groups and maybe not kill them but to push them around, threatening to kill them and at the same time grab secure territory or beeing able to severely invade his areas.]
;B[of];W[nd];B[mf]C[C:

Is the extra jump a good idea?

J:

I think so. It puts pressure on R12.];W[ld];B[rd]C[this makes sense right? to make a base?

J:

Yep. Seems OK to me, but don't forget to harass R12 when you are safe.]
;W[qc]C[J:

R17 should have been spent on  the R12 group.
See also move 24.];B[qj]C[J:

Well done.];W[ri]C[J:

??

If something could be done jumping out would be a better idea for white.]
;B[pi]C[J:

OK.];W[bq]C[J:

White group R12 seems dead indeed.]
(;B[cr]C[C:

Should this move be later?

J:

I think you should spend a move on this. (see "pass-variation").
I think B2 is OK but it looks scary if white plays D2.  Be sure to block on the right side. (see "B2-variation")]
;W[ho]C[J:

White needed to spend a move on this group.]
(;B[mp]C[C:

Perhaps a little slow? Maybe I should play somewhere in the northwest corner?

J:

I don't think he can invade around N3 yet because he should take care of his H5-group first. If you'd like to play from that side better do L5. Mabe if you can do P3 later you'll have a considerable mojo or even points.
I'm thinking F5 is also good for ptreventing him to link up with the left.

First try to attack then take big points. 

But even as a big point this seems too unsolid. Maybe then O3, P3?
(But then again I think the other moves should be considered first. )]
;W[je];B[ge]C[J:

This seems a little high. Why?
Try a bit lower if you want to spoil. However the other side might be better because there's more open space.]
;W[qq]C[J:

Big one. 
(Although I can imagine myself invading first and then securing my own territory:)
Black R3 or Q3, then (e.g.) White E15, then Black 'some invasion' would be better for black. Even if white spends a move on his mojo, it is still possible to invade, so the invasion was not that urgent.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[nr];W[ps]
;B[sp]C[J:

Endgame move (although large) and you can't kill him (if that was your intention). 
If you want to spend a move I think R6 is better. Makes gote of white T5 and is as solid as concrete.
But: better spend a move on your G15 invasion. Like G17?];W[gc]
;B[cf]C[J:

Your two stones seem splittable. On the other hand: you could treat one of the two as forcing move.]
(;W[gd]C[J:

??

This seems to solid for white. I'd split at E14 or attack from C15 or C12.]
;B[ee]C[J:

Why not make a base with C11?
Don't try to safe all stones.];W[ch];B[cd]
(;W[dc]C[J:

Splitting at D15 would be better for white I think.];B[cc];W[jn]
;B[mm]C[C:

Maybe because I was playing a better player I was too timid? Should I push for more territory here?

J:
Probably. (Too timid I mean.)  Better idea might be to attack him by preventing him to connect to the left. Let's say E6 or F5. Maybe you could harass his left later. (Although that seems rather solid.) You might frustrate a white mojo around F8.

Try not to be impressed too much by higher ranks. Try to think logically and just experiment by following good advice from books or other players. The worst thing that can happen is that you lose the game, but you'll probably learn more. 
(I should say this to myself more often....)];W[rc];B[rg]C[C:

I understand why this is bad.];W[re]C[J:

That's why? :-)];B[qe];W[qd]
(;B[se];W[sd];B[sf]C[J:

Hm. Just one stone.];W[he];B[ed]C[J:

Tricky. Better connect with D15?];W[db];B[cb];W[jk];B[mj]C[C:

timid?

J:

Just like N4: Too protective for your area.
White threatens to make a good mojo around F8. Or maybe this is too solid already.]
;W[en]C[J:

Yep.]
(;B[gp]C[C:

What is the best way to extend this group's territory?

J:

There's not much possibility for gaining more territory. This group is sealed in. Other moves elsewhere gain more territory. 
The priority for this group is to live. I think it's good you spend a move. I think it might be dead if you don't. See variation.]
;W[hp];B[go];W[gn];B[de]C[J:

This cut has been a good move for white for quite some time. It's good you protect it now.]
;W[ec]C[J:

Good for white if you want to safe the 3 stones, but i wonder if white E12 isn't bigger?]
;B[fe]C[C:

this is probably slow? A move out into the open would have been better maybe?

J:

True. The stone is not that important. How about F11?

By the way: The focus has shifted to this area but is the group F3 still killable?]
;W[fh]C[C:

like there!

J:

As I was saying... ;-)];B[gg];W[ih];B[gh];W[fi];B[if]C[C:

not a good idea? I should play where white plays next?

J:

White can cut. Seems too far.]

OK. This is what the score-estimator of GlGo makes of it: 
You are about 49 points behind.

The game is essentialy over.

Score estimation:

White territory: 123
White captures: 1

Black territory: 73
Black captures: 2

White score: 124.0
Black score: 75.0

White wins by 49.0

Wit wins: 26,0 points.

Summary:

White could take the area around F9 too easy. You could have prevented that from the upper side or from the lower side.

There were some (as you correctly indicated yourself) timid moves where you should have applied more pressure on his weak groups or should have reduced his area.
But then again: The invasion around R12 was (I think) correctly killed.
