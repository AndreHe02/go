(;B[qg]LB[qh:a][qf:b][qm:c]C[This is the first questionable move and it certainly cannot be said to be wrong. 'a' would be a more severe attack on W6 but would leave a cap at 'b' for W to exploit. Perhaps a more natual sequence is shown by the variation starting at 'c']
;W[qm];B[cj];W[cm]LB[cg:a][jd:b][jp:c][nc:d][np:e]C[Not wrong, but there is no need for W to commit between this and 'a'. A move at 'b' or 'c' can be considered with follow ups at 'd' and 'e' respectively.]
;B[cf]LB[ch:a][cg:b]C[Too wide.  Invites an invasion at 'a'.  Best to hold back to 'b']
;W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[ic]LB[dh:a][hc:b][jc:c][oc:d][kc:e]C[Way off target.  First of all, B should stabilize his group on the left by playing 'a'.  Secondly, B15 is definitely the wrong point at the top. 'a', 'b' and 'c', in order of preference are better.  How will B respond to a W play at  'e'  - there is no extension to the left.]
;W[ch]C[Definitely a big play, but with B15 being in such a bad position W should consider attacking that first with the aim of playing this move as part of the attack.]
;B[bh]C[This looks timid but it is hard to counter when B has a stone badly placed at B15]
;W[bi];B[ci];W[bg];B[dh];W[cg];B[dg];W[bf]C[White has mistaken this for the sequence when B13 and W14 are not exchanged.  Without those 2 stones W should now cut.]
;B[ce];W[ah];B[ee]LB[df:a]C[Dangerous - this does not protect the cutting point at 'a']
;W[ed];B[bj];W[be]LB[af:a][cd:b]C[Not needed - B cannot play 'a'   All this does is force Bb]
;B[cd];W[bc];B[lc];W[gf];B[ff]LB[fg:a]C['a' is better shape];W[gg];B[fj]
;W[lq]LB[mq:a][jq:b]C[Bad.  If W is going to extend this far then he should at least play 'a', which threatens the corner invasion.  However, holding back to 'b' with a follow up at 'a' is better.]
;B[iq]LB[jq:a]C[Not severe enough on W38. 'a' is better.];W[gq]LB[eq:a]
[fq:b]C[The infamous butterfly formation.  This is a bad shape as it is open to invasion at the 3-3 point. W should hold back with 'a' or 'b'.]
;B[jo];W[lo];B[fq]LB[on:a]C[Wrong point. B shuold not lose the 3-3 invasion so easily. 'a' looks like the start of a splitting attack.]
;W[gp];B[dq];W[fp];B[cp];W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[cr];W[co];B[do];W[ep];B[bo]
;W[cn];B[bp]C[Very unexpected sequence.  B has got a lot of undeserved profit but he has weakened the two stone on the outside and so probably cannot develop an attack on either the two pairs of W stones.  All-in-all, W has sente and iis ahead on this exchange.]
;W[dk]LB[km:a]C[Wrong direction.  This group is unlikely to die and, given that, there is little territory to be gained here. 'a' looks like an excellent point.]
;B[dj]LB[ak:a][fh:b][ge:c]C[Timid.  B has nothing to worry about - 'a' is a dual threat to start a ko or connect along the edge.  aking shape with 'b' and threatening 'c' is more severe on W.  It also protects the cutting point.]
;W[jm]LB[km:a]C['a' is better as it attacks B while creating a moyo behind it.  This move forces B to run to the very place W has territory potential.]
;B[kn];W[kl]C[The only reason for this move is to develop a splitting attack on the upper left group but this is too abmitious. W is losing his sense of direction.]
;B[lm];W[nn];B[mn]LB[ll:a]C[Terrible shape. 'a' is much better.];W[mo];B
[no];W[np];B[oo];W[op];B[pp];W[nq];B[or];W[nr];B[kr];W[lr];B[kp];W[nm];B
[pn];W[ln];B[hn]C[B's play here was ovewr ambitious.  Moreover, it was not necessary.  W was forcing B to go exactly where he wanted to, but in midstream he backtracked and W ended up with a feasable position.]

;W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[pa];W[qb];B[oe];W[rd];B[fb]LB[ie:a]C[I can't see the point of this.  W is not threatened and this is certainly not an important area. 'a' has far more potential.]
;W[gc];B[gb];W[eb];B[ge];W[fe];B[he];W[ef];B[df]LB[fg:a]C[Why try to safe 4 unimportant stones when 'a' would leave the 2 W stones floating.  If Ba, W probably doesn't have time to cut here.]
;W[fg]C[This makes B105, 107 look silly.];B[hc]LB[ig:a]C[Small.  B must use 107 before it goes to waste. Play 'a']
;W[le]C[Too deep.  W does not need this much.];B[ek]LB[lg:a]C[Only 'a' should have been considered]
;W[oh];B[og];W[mh];B[ph];W[oi];B[pm];W[ql];B[ol];W[pl];B[nl];W[ll];B[ml]
LB[om:a]C[Pointless.  Just connect at 'a' and leave this as a future threat]

There is nothing remarkable about the remainder of this game.  Both players made several mistakes in the direction fo play in both the opening and the middle game.]

(;B[ql]LB[qg:a]C[This expands in front of the shimari and so is perhaps preferable to 'a']
;W[qg];B[mc]LB[qe:a]C['a' can also be played to press the attack.  this move leads to a more leisurely game.]
;W[rd]LB[qe:a]C[Absolutley essential.  A B play at would attack while completing the corner.]
;B[qc]C[Not as  critical as W10 but preserves the option option of an attack on W later.  Could also be played on the left side.]
