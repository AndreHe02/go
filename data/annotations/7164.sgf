C[This is the second game I played against JimK on 3-16-2009. I feel this is a good game to review as it displays some of my problems well.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[cd]LB[ec:A][pd:B][qo:C]C[Cayol :
A kakari at A is also interesting.  It works well with B. Or a shimari at C.]
;B[pj]LB[pk:A][qk:B][pp:C]C[Cayol :
This move seems a little strange. We would expect A ( high chinese fuseki) or B ( the low one). The marked stone would work better with a sanrensei ( a stone at C). To sum up : the three black stones doesn't work well together.]
;W[fc];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[bo]LB[bo:B][cp:A]C[I have barely studied josekis at all, and I was not familar with this move. I usually expect this to be at A
Cayol : B can be  played and you both play the joseki ! B is one of Kitani Minoru's favorite moves ( see Kogo's joseki Dictionary).]

;B[ol];W[nl];B[ok];W[qg]C[The exchange prior to this I feel I could have done much better with.]
;B[qe]C[Good answer but after you are too kind. White overplays. You should punish him. It's a shame that he could finaly live here.]

Cayol : no pb.];B[io];W[jn]LB[in:A][hp:B]C[B is better. It makes eys shape and protect the cut.]

;B[ch];W[cg];B[bn];W[bq];B[bh];W[bg]LB[ib:B][ig:A][dh:D][mk:C]
C[Cayol : I think you should'nt have invaded. Let's count. It's the right time. Black has 46 points in the upper right corner, 30 in the left side, 10 in the lower rght corner. 86 points for black.
White has 46 points in the upper left corner, 28 in the lower side, 10 in the lower left corner, 3 in the middle right side. White has 87 points. 
Black is not behind. He should widen softly his territory.
Black A seems huge.  
White has many answers.
After this, B, C and D are big.]
