[fn][gn][in][eo][ho][oo][fp][gp][sr][ss]C[A couple big things stand out. 

The D9 hane was huge for black. White stood have a much closer game if black didn't get that and the capture that followed. There are easily 40 points that were lost by missing that one move. 

The misplay on the top side early on, ie not cutting at G17 cost a fair bit also. Sacrificing the KJ17 stones was correct, and a lot of local group stability would have been whites instead of black's. 

The early development of black's right side moyo basically set the course of this game. White got a lucky blunder from black, and lived on the right side. Otherwise this would have been an early resign by white. The N16 play, the play in the upper right corner, the weak lower center group acted together to setup that large moyo that basically won black the game, even after white invaded. 

Finally, the end game had a lot of points lost. Missing tesujis and following black's lead cost white a fair amount. Fixing earlier misplays erase many of the things black took advantage of in the end game, so missing moves like the D9 hane is even worse than it looks like at the time. For instance, black could not have connected to A17 without having captured D10 etc. 

I think you would really benefit from some life and death problems, tesuji problems and end game problems. 

Hope this helps.
