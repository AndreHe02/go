C[I'm pretty happy with the result.  But the Center is under pressure.  Should I treat the two stones lightly for now?  It's cutting stones so I decided to fight here.

klin: Yes, treat them lightly is correct.  But look at the result, K15 move does not gain anything.  B's invasion only eleminated a little bit white territory.  But W is thick in the center.]

klin: B R11 is a better threat.  W cannot afford to respond.  Then, B S12.  The result is better.]

;W[kc]C[Second ko.  No choice here.];B[pb];W[nj]C[klin: B has to respond to this one.  B has L10, K9, and E16 3 more threats.  Bu even if B wins the ko, W plays two move at, say, D4 and C3, B is still bad.

No comment beyond this point.];B[qe]C[This take was bad.  The whole group dies.  That's it.  Thanks for all the comments and corrections.]
