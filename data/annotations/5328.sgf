C[Review by DrGoPlayer];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq]LB[qj:A]
C[I expected A next..]
(;W[qf]C[This is a mistake in direction, but I have no idea how to effectively punish it.

First it is at worst a small mistake.  A point or a 1/4 point?  So there will be no dramatic punishment.
There is a strong shape in the LR and the 4-4 stone is strong.   Maybe pincer at Q11 or R11.  See further threads]

(;B[qh];W[of];B[nd]LB[pi:B][qj:A]C[When I was about 5 stones weaker, all my opponents would play this way: jump out and counterpincer at A. It usually led to a running fight and my resignation.

The best move for w is at B.  This is why you might not want to pincer this way here]

(;W[mf]LB[qk:A]C[This was a surprise.

I don't think I can play at A to settle the pincer stone: it looks like the corner would have trouble even living.

You did fine here.  After A the corner is in no danger.  it will just become small]

(;B[ld]LB[jc:B][qc:A]C[It doesn't feel like I'm making any profit this way: this area is open on two sides (at A and B).

Both sides have a weak group.  Both groups have 2 ways to run.  OK.  The top should become some territory]

(;W[qj]LB[rd:A][ql:B]C[What are my options here? How should I be thinking about this position?

Can I sacrifice the pincer stone with A or B and get a decent result? Running seems heavy, and generally futile.

First A threatens to connect to the stone - see thread.  I dont care for B]

(;B[oh]C[This seems fine.  Keep S16 as reserve];W[mh];B[oj]
;W[qm]C[See the thread]
(;B[rk]C[This is a tesuji to protect the cut]
(;W[rj];B[qk];W[pk];B[pj];W[ql]
(;B[qd]C[I've lost many games because I tried to attack a weak group instead of take profit.

I couldn't threaten to kill anything right now, so I stabilized my upper corner.

See the thread.  B has several moves to take profit from the tesuji.  Then S16 takes the corner and threatens a connection]

(;W[rg];B[ok]C[good];W[pl];B[qi];W[rl];B[ri];W[sk]LB[rn:A]C[First w is not completely alive.  A takes away an eye but not now.

See my thread.  Helping your weak group and attacking the weakest w group is the urgent move]

(;B[kf]LB[mj:A]C[This move does nothing. The white group can run out and black can't profit from it.

Agree.  A is the right direction here.  For both players as it strengthens the weak group and attacks a weak group]
;W[mj]C[W has a poblem.  Still no territory.

B must secure the weak group with giving w a lot of influence]
;B[nl];W[on]LB[lf:E][nf:B][lg:D][mg:C][ng:A]C[The peek at A is surely worth considering.  W has a connection in ko tho so maybe wait until it will be a flower viewing ko for black]

(;B[ro]LB[kh:D][ll:C][mm:A][mn:B]C[This removes the probe and threatens to weaken white's other group.

This threatens a strong group but doesnt threaten to kill so it should be ignored by w.  Bad idea.

You must help the weak group and pressure your opponents weak group.  That is urgent.  See thread

For W now A, B C are possible but I think C would be not so good.  Around D is also possible for w]
;W[mn]C[right];B[ll]LB[jc:B][jp:A]C[As w I would be worried about the peek at O13 so a few moves to fix that.  B is strong on top so making him stronger is OK]

(;W[kk]C[I don't understand this move. There are better ways for White to run out, and surely White can play at A or B and not die.

W is trying to attack your group and not worrying about his group]

(;B[lk]C[black is committing to killing the w group.  Is that necessary?

See the thread.];W[lj];B[kj];W[jk];B[ki];W[kh];B[jh];W[kg];B[jg]
;W[ji]LB[jj:A]C[reasonable so far.  at A is urgent]
(;B[lf]LB[jj:A]C[See the thread with w at A]
(;W[mg]C[so w should take the two stones instead as in the thread]
;B[jj];W[ii];B[ij];W[jf];B[hi];W[ih]LB[ig:A][hh:B]
(;B[il]C[now b is still ahead but w has secured his groups]
;W[ig];B[lp];W[kn];B[km]C[I have put in a thread were w tenukis here]

(;W[jn]LB[jp:A]C[How should I continue attacking? In the game I played J3, but maybe A is better.

Are you attacking a live group?  See thread off previous move.  The w group isnt killable so why attack it?

See my continuation off K3]
(;B[iq]C[I think this is bad shape.];W[dj]LB[fc:A][cl:C][cp:B]
C[With the black stones nearby, is sanrensei as effective? Does the center group help invasions or reductions?

Play on 4th line to attack or make a big moyo.  so 3rd line is better here.  w needs some territory

now maye b should approach at A and then invade at B or C]
(;B[fp]C[Maybe low is better.

yes probably.  or see previous comment];W[cn];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq]
;W[cr]LB[cc:C][fc:B][rn:A]C[Now what?]
(;B[hn]LB[jc:A]C[I dont think w needs to answer this.  See the thread I put in for making another eye.  also moves at L4, K4, N4, O4 should suffice

W at A is huge.  threatens to reduce b top area and starts on finally getting some serious territory]
;W[rn];B[fc];W[hc]C[w is behind in cash and must not allow b to have more on top]
;B[jc]LB[cc:B][dc:D][cd:C][gd:A][fe:E]C[A seems good for w]

(;W[hd]C[this is slow for w.  I think b can come out.  see the thread]

(;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[hj];B[ik];W[gj];B[fd];W[fe]
LB[cj:B][dk:C][cl:A]C[maybe b is 10 points ahead but w can reduce or invade bottom area so you cant relax.
C is for reduction and increasing black territory.  A or B to invade]

(;B[dk];W[cj];B[bc];W[bd];B[ad];W[ae];B[ac];W[bf]
(;B[el]C[Around this point I counted that I was about 5-10 points ahead.

Right.  w has gotten a lot of territory and bottom is invadable.  D7 is more severe than E8.  L4 is good.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[lq]
(;B[kq];W[mp]
(;B[kp]C[see my addition to N3 thread];W[nq]
(;B[op];W[nr]LB[no:A]C[Black loses about 15 points here. White is ahead, and has better endgame.

Yes a big loss here.  B is still maybe a little  ahead.

You missed good move at O5]
(;B[mo]C[ouch.  losing move];W[no];B[lo];W[np]LB[cl:B][ln:C]
[or:A]C[You must  play at  A, then B and C.  W has about 70 points of which 60 is on left and 10 in lower right.
b has 40 in top groups, 30 in left bottom, 10 in lower right]
