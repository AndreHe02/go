C[Hi, thanks a lot for reviewing my game. I didn't really like
how i came out of the fuseki, although I'm not sure if I was
actually behind. My middlegame was kind of purposeless and I
basically made up for it in the endgame, not in the least thanks
to a huge mistake by him.

> Ok summary :

I suggest you rely more on attacking and moyo play.

In this game, you played a lot of high stones, but you didn't reap enough benefits because of slow moves like 34 or rash moves like 42.

Try making huge moyo even if it looks ridiculous at first. He will invade and then you seize control with a fierce attack.

Look for profit from any attack, be it cash, or more moyo. In any case, attacking is fun and a great way to learn plenty.

When behind, keep an active stance by looking for a severe counterattack (bad aji in opponent).

Recommended reading : Attack & Defense. And tsumego to sharpen a feel for group strength, helps a LOT.
