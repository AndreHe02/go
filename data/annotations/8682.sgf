C[pz- hi! i'm pzykr, 9kyu under a different name on KGS. my comments will be preceeded with pz- to make them easy to spot and keep them separate from your many comments. i may or may not respond directly to your comments and questions as i'll be following my own train of thought...

on the GTL website it recommends that you choose games that you did not win by a large margin, just by the by...

i will refer to moves by their move number rather than by their location on the board, for the most part. i recommend that you set your sgf viewer to show all move numbers. if your sgf viewer doesn't have that option, multigo (which i'm using to comment this game) does and is free to download... i will use a capital letter/number combination to refer to a location on the board, eg A1 for the lower left corner. (otherwise i use few capitals;). in this game b1 (black's first move) is on P15.

+++++++++++++

Dear reviewer,

in this game i played white. I think i did a good job unless
some mistakes during the game. At the end i won. It would be
nice if your comments could be more detailed because i'm just
a beginner and i want to know why i should play certain moves.
i hope you enjoy commenting my game and that you won't be freaked
out about some of my moves^^];B[oe]C[pz- this is playable but very unusual. i know you didn't play this move and i was asked to review for white, but i think mentioning salient points about your opponent's moves can be helpful, too...]
;W[pq];B[no];W[dp];B[dn];W[dd];B[qo];W[np]C[pz- N3 better (making a two-point extension on the third line establishes a base that can usually easily be turned into a living group). what is the purpose of making a contact play here? contact plays are often good to settle a group (make it alive or nearly so) or to make shape. in this case, w's contact play helps b make shape (the beginning of a large territorial framework [moyo\], working together with b1).]
;B[mo];W[mp];B[lp];W[lq];B[kp];W[kq]C[pz- this is called "pushing from behind" and is only worth, at most, two points. securing your corner would be bigger--and safer: say S4 or therebouts. the defect in your shape between w2 and w8 is glaring and asking to be exploited.]
;B[jq];W[hq]C[pz- w16 would already allow a devastating cut at N3. w12 and w14 die and your terri on the bottom right is ruined.]
;B[jr];W[kr]C[pz- if b cuts at N3 your stones around L3 would die... a move at N2 would have protected against the cut and made some eyeshape. 


+++++++++

until this move i tried to make some territory in the lower right
corner];B[js]C[pz- b misses N3 and playes a useless point--may as well have passed.]
;W[ho]C[pz- the lower right corner is vulnerable. b can immediately play R3 (the three-three point, called san-san in japanese) or S3. depending on how this corner is played it could make a difference of close to 20 points (either 10 points for you or 10 points for your opponent, a 20 point "swing"). and anyway, bN3 would destroy your whole shape on the bottom right...]
;B[in];W[hn];B[ip]C[with moves 20 and 22 i tried to seperate black's groups and build
some territory

++++++++++++

pz- very difficult to build territory from out in the center of the board! b could next play C3 and you could not prevent b from living in the corner.]
;W[jd];B[hr];W[gr];B[hp];W[gp];B[gs];W[fs];B[fr];W[hs];B[fq]
;W[fp];B[ir];W[gq];B[bn];W[co];B[fn];W[hm]C[pz- this move invites b to cut at G5.

++++++++++

i think until 40 i did a good job but....];B[gl];W[pj]C[i should have played H8 instead of Q10 because that would have
been the better and bigger move


+++++++++++++

pz- wH8 would have given b a bigger target to attack after bG5. the four w stones would become "heavy," with b stones all around, no eyespace, and not many prospects for doing anything useful except serving as a focus of attack from b.

instead of playing w42 on the fourth line, you might have considered playing on the third line instead (R10). you are in effect "splitting" b's right side with this move and with all the b stones and no w stones in the area it would be good if you could extend two points to either side of w42 (at R10), to either R7 or R13 depending on which side b approaches from, and make a stable base. 
actually, w42 would have been better placed further from b's thickness below on R11.  consider the whole board! lots of b stones facing the center down below and the one b stone above make R11 a much better move than Q10. 

looking at w24, the situation is completely different...

the third line is called "the line of territory" because it's much, much easier to make a living group with stones on the third line than with stones on the fourth line. the fourth line is called "the line of influence" because it looks more towards the center of the board; a shape with no defects facing the center from the fourth line has a tremendous range of power in the center. 

w6 and w24, being on the fourth line, can be developed into a strong shape facing the center of the board, eventually. however, when one enters into the opponent's "sphere of influence" as with w42, that stone's safety should be a priority: third line, not fourth!]
;B[il]C[here H8 is to late because black can connect with H9]
;W[hl];B[hk];W[dj];B[fl];W[go];B[fo];W[eo];B[en];W[do]C[pz- this is not a good move; it creates one of the "bad shapes" (the one called "the soldier's helmet") and allows b to significantly reduce w's terri in the lower left. also, at the end of this sequence (b59) black is left with tremendously powerful shape which overshadows the weak fourth-line w46 and dominates the left side.

instead of playing the miniscule w52 here it would been better to have taken "sente" or initiative, pushed up between b5 and b37, threatening b37 with death and playing the game on your terms instead of your opponent's.

sente is an important concept: it means your opponent must respond to your move. one tries to keep sente (the initiative) as long as one has it and find ways to take it away from the opponent whenever possible--even at the cost of a few stones.

the opposite of sente is "gote." a gote move does not constrain your opponent in any way and gives him/her the opportunity to play anywhere he or she wishes: sente.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[ap];W[aq];B[ao];W[br];B[cn]C[pz- this is an example of a gote move. it was necessary to prevent your playing there, but now you can play anywhere else on the board you choose--you now have sente. what will you do with it?]
;W[cq]C[pz- unless there is something i'm missing here, some devastating attack b can unleash, this move wasted your sente...]
;B[gn]C[pz- in turn b makes a useless move that wastes sente and might as well have been a pass...]
;W[io]C[pz- yes! this is a sente move to which b definitely should respond.]
;B[im]C[here i thought the lower left side is safe so i tried to isolate
black's stone at R5 with P5];W[oo]C[pz- this move overlooks pushing through b's position with wK5. why else play w62 just to tenuki (play elsewhere) when b here gives you the opportunity to badly damage b's shape? the "only move" here is K5!

as to the move you chose here, w64; it does not prevent bN3 and the destruction of much of your shape at the bottom right. played one point lower at P4 it would have fixed much of your shape problem here.]
;B[po];W[mr]C[i think here it would be better to play P6 and try to cut black
instead of N2 which i thought would stabilize my territory

+++++++++

N2 (w66) is the best move i've seen played in a looonnngg time! finally b cannot kill your whole bottom right! the cut at P4 is huge now as a result of your not having played there with w64.]
;B[op];W[on];B[om]C[pz- this was not the proper follow-up move to b67: b should have played Q4. since b did not, you should play there next.]
;W[pn];B[oq];W[pp];B[nq];W[mq]C[pz- b's three stones 67, 71, and 73, have only two liberties and should die. you should thank b for this!]
;B[pr];W[or]C[pz- good! the "only" move...];B[pm];W[qn];B[ro]
;W[rm];B[qr];W[qq]C[i think this is bad move because it has no purpose i should have
played somewhere else like O7


pz- well, at least this move makes b's chances for seizing terri in the lower right corner very minimal, but i agree with you. it's also the classic "bad shape" "empty triangle."]
;B[ql];W[rl];B[rk];W[qk];B[qm];W[rj];B[sk];W[sj];B[rn];W[nm]
C[this was a big mistake. i didn't see during the game that  the
Q6 group was in atari. without this mistake the lower corners
would both be mine

+++++++++

pz- yes. huge mistake! in this case the only move was to capture below with O2. oh, you could have tried to make b chase you with a ladder that wouldn't work because of w6 ladder-breaker, but that depends on bad play from b and one should NEVER depend on that! always assume your opponent will make the best play possible--- which means you should know what move that is before you place your own stone.]
;B[nn];W[nr]C[after this move i tried to isolate black's groups from each other]
;B[oo];W[mm];B[rq];W[ol];B[mk];W[ln];B[jo];W[jn];B[lo];W[iq]
;B[jp];W[kn]C[pz- watch your cutting points! O8 is screaming "play me!"]
;B[nl]C[pz- bO8--you already have 5 dead stones now. play elsewhere!]
;W[nk];B[pk];W[qj];B[ml];W[ok];B[pl];W[mj];B[lm];W[ll];B[mn]
;W[lk];B[km];W[ls];B[jm]C[but unfortunately it didn't worked out for me]
;W[os]C[pz- it was very important for you to have secured the life of the w group on the bottom right: w120 did that. w122 was an unecessary gote play that gives b license to play anywhere...]
;B[ps];W[ks]C[pz- fair enough, b and w both make useless plays...]
;B[is];W[gs];B[kj]C[pz- b should have cut directly on M10 instead of forcing you to make your shape stronger...]
;W[lj];B[li];W[mh];B[ni];W[mi];B[nj];W[oj];B[ng];W[nh];B[oh]
;W[oi];B[og];W[mg];B[kh];W[pd]C[here i tried to invade the upper right corner

+++++++++++

pz- and it would have worked had you played san-san (R17). again--very difficult to make territory from the fourth line. with w at san-san b could not have prevented w living in the corner. (of course, when i say something like that, "with proper play" should be understood.)]
;B[mf];W[lf];B[le];W[kf];B[je];W[ke];B[jg];W[me];B[nf];W[ld]
;B[nd]C[pz- dangerous cutting point at M13! 

btw--placing w142 to invade the corner then not following up to try to secure the corner simply wastes w142... it was already misplaced and needed some help!]
;W[nc];B[md];W[mc];B[id];W[ie];B[jf];W[hd];B[ic];W[jc];B[hc]
;W[ge];B[hf];W[pf]C[pz- if bH15 w158 dies and b is connected. cutting and connecting: consider these tactics *at every move!*]
;B[ne];W[le]C[pz- afraid of a ko? w168 seems slow--gote. and there is a proverb: "if you're afraid of ko, don't play go!"]
;B[he];W[gd];B[if]C[pz- entirely unnecessary for b to have captured this stone: a gote move... how can w capitalize on being given sente this way?]
;W[lg]C[pz- this is another gote move, but as it fixes the cutting point not a bad move. a move like this which is kinda slow but should be played anyway is called "honte," which means honest...

with this move (and not until this move) w's group is completely alive--with "proper play" it cannot be killed.]
;B[lh];W[ph];B[oc];W[od];B[pe];W[qe];B[qd];W[pc];B[qf];W[qg]
C[pz- no! only move for w182 is S15. w has an opportunity to kill all these b stones.]
;B[ob]C[pz- if instead of b183, bR17 followed by capturing w178, there may have been a way to live these stones, and the corner, for b.]
;W[rf];B[lc]C[pz- b still has chances with R17 here.];W[of]
;B[lb];W[pb];B[nb];W[pg]C[pz- with help from b, you got them anyway... this was a huge blunder by b. it was good technique not to capture before it was necessary.]
;B[mb];W[kb];B[kc];W[jb];B[kd]C[pz- cutting points! protect 'em!]
;W[la]C[until now i managed to get the upper right corner as territory
now i wanted to kill the N18 group and luckily black made a mistake
by playing J19. my K18 group has 3 liberties and blacks N18 group
has 4. normally i would lose the fight but with black mistake
i'm ahead by taking black's liberties. i also played M19 instead
of the other liberties of black's group so that i can connect
at L19 if needed.];B[ia];W[ma];B[ja];W[na]C[pz- again, poor play by b gives you another group of b stones. b could have-with correct play-killed your w194 group of stones and lived this now-dead b group...]
;B[sm];W[sl];B[ka];W[oa];B[sn];W[ib];B[hb];W[ha];B[ie];W[gb]
;B[kg];W[gj];B[ff];W[gf];B[gc];W[fc];B[fb];W[ga];B[fa];W[ia]
;B[fd]C[here i thought safe the N15 group is more important than the
one stone at F17

++++++++

pz- N15 group? if you mean w214 and the other three stones there, i agree.]
;W[gg];B[ec];W[dc];B[db];W[cb];B[ca];W[ba];B[da];W[bc];B[gi]
;W[hi]C[i played this stone because i wanted to connect my groups and
cut black with some following moves around K9];B[gh];W[hh];B[fh]
;W[fg];B[hj];W[eh]C[pz- poor play by b  helps you out again...]
;B[ab];W[ac];B[fj];W[fi];B[gk];W[gi];B[ej];W[ek];B[fk];W[dl]
;B[ik];W[ef];B[fe];W[ee];B[ed];W[ji]C[that is the reason why i played this stone]

;B[jj]C[unfortunately it didn't work out

+++++++++

pz- seems w has done well here, holding b to a very minimun amount of territory.]
;W[ii];B[ki];W[cm];B[bl];W[bm];B[am];W[bk];B[cl];W[dm];B[al]
;W[ck];B[ak];W[aj];B[an];W[gm];B[fm];W[em]C[pz- this move was "dame" -- played on a point that could not possibly become terri for either you or your opponent... but that's ok, cause the games is really over anyway, and has been for quite some time...]
;B[er];W[eq];B[es];W[ep];B[ko];W[ig];B[hg];W[ih];B[jh];W[gh]
;B[bb];W[aa];B[bb];W[ab];B[fc]C[pz- b playes on a point of his/her own territory. the game is now past over...]
;W[jl];B[jk];W[tt];B[ea];W[tt];B[kn]C[pz- utterly useless play by b... just takes yet another point of b's own terri.]
;W[tt];B[nm]C[pz- and again. w should keep passing as long as b is reducing his or her own terri!]
;W[tt];B[qp]C[pz- even this capture takes a point from b's terri--these w stones were already dead-worse than pointless to kill them]
;W[tt];B[cs];W[dr];B[tt]C[and that's it. i hope you enjoyed it and that you find my comments
helpful for giving me the right clues how i could improve my
game.];W[tt]TB[ss][qn][eb][mm][jn][ln][on][pn][so][pp][rp][sp]
