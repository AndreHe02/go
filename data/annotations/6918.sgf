C[Hi!

My name is Jon and I'll be providing the commentary for your review.  My comments start with "Jon:".]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]

(;B[de]C[Jon:  Approaching the top left corner is plausible, but because black is using the Chinese opening, it's a bit contradictory to his original plan (i.e. to build a framework).

Can you find a move that would be a better fit with black's plan of building a territorial framework?]
;W[cg]
(;B[cc]LB[cg:A]C[Jon:  Attaching into the corner is the wrong choice of joseki here.  By strengthening the corner stone prematurely, black won't be able to press down on the stone at A as easily to build influence towards the center.  For more information on this, please see the variations at move 16.

What should black do instead?];W[cb];B[cd]
(;W[eb]LB[ef:A]C[Jon:  Fixing the cut directly is a key mistake in this fight.  While it's solid, it puts white in a very low position, allowing black to make the kosumi at A in sente.  

Can you find a move that strengthens the corner while denying black that opportunity?]
;B[ef];W[gd]LB[dh:A]C[Jon:  Now white wants to get out of the low position, so working his way to higher ground is necessary, but black will be able to get the pressing move at A now.]
;B[dh];W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[dg];W[mp]LB[di:A]C[Jon:  Good!  This is a very important area for both players, so it's plausible to play away from the left side for this.  White getting here first means the Chinese opening's development is checked, it can't move down either side (the top or bottom), which is painful for black.

Also, later, pushing up at A would be a nice move for white on the left side.]
;B[po];W[jq]LB[jp:C][mp:A][mq:B]C[Jon:  Placing this extension on the third line feels a bit weird because the stone at A is now awkwardly placed.  To provide another perspective, please imagine this current move at K-3 was played first, then at A.  It would be best placed at N-3 (B) instead to prevent black from digging underneath.

With all of this said, this stone would be best placed on the fourth line (at C) to avoid leaving any awkwardly placed stones.]
;B[ck]LB[dk:A]TR[cg][bh][ci]C[Jon:  Since white neglected the marked stones to attack the bottom right, allowing black to attack them is reasonable, but pincering on the third line is dangerous, it allows white to separate it from the black stones above easily when he escapes.  Instead, placing this stone on the fourth line (at A) still puts the pressure on the white stones while making it harder to separate from the other black stones.]
;W[dj]LB[ck:A]C[Jon:  Now the attacker is starting to become the defender, black's stone at A is not feeling too happy .]
;B[cn]
(;W[dk]TR[ci][dj]C[Jon:  Since white's bottom left corner stone is now under attack from black's approach, it's more important to strengthen the corner first.  White's marked stones are already on their way out into the center, so they can wait temporarily.

What's the best way to strengthen the bottom left corner?]
(;B[fq]C[Jon:  White's pretty strong on the bottom, so double approaching feels a bit questionable for black.  It'd be safer to take the 3-3 invasion right away.]

(;W[co]C[Jon:  Once black has made the double approach, bumping (and thus strengthening) the first approach stone is no longer a good idea, you'll need as much room as you can to move out.

What's a better way to move out white's corner stone?];B[dn]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[do]C[Jon:  It's painful for black to have to fix the cut like this and allow black into the corner, but he has no choice.]
;B[dq]LB[cr:A]C[Jon:  This is the right idea, but it's too slow, black can safely move into the corner more quickly by sliding to A.]
;W[hq];B[gq];W[cl]LB[em:A]C[Jon:  Killing off these black stones is the right idea, but this hane makes your potential territory smaller by playing inside it, so it'd be better to go for the whole thing with the cap at A right away.]
;B[bg];W[cq];B[cr];W[bq];B[go];W[em]LB[cl:A]C[Jon:  Capping the two black stones is fine here, but the stone at A is no longer so useful.]
;B[lq]LB[io:A]TR[go][gp][dq][eq][fq][gq][cr]C[Jon:  Starting this invasion is a bit dangerous since the marked black stones aren't settled yet.  I'd prefer to move them out with a jump to A first before making the invasion.]

(;W[mq]C[Jon:  Blocking from this side is extremely dangerous, white can't afford to let black separate his stones apart.]
;B[lp];W[lr];B[kr];W[lo];B[kp];W[mr];B[kq]
(;W[jo]TR[kp][lp][kq][lq][kr]C[Jon:  This has the right idea, but it's too direct, black can push through and exploit the cutting points easily, so a more subtle move is necessary.

Can you find a more effective way to pressure the marked black stones?]
;B[ko];W[kn];B[jp];W[io];B[ip];W[hp];B[ho];W[mn];B[iq]LB[im:A]
TR[io][jo]C[Jon:  Before black fixes this weakness, he can pressure the outside white stones by threatening to capture two of them with A.  Beyond that though, black made a nice amount of points here, so white will have to destroy some of the right side to compensate.]
;W[qq]LB[qm:A][qp:B]C[Jon:  White is decently strong on the outside, so I'd consider invading directly in the side at A and leave the possibility for invading the corner open.  By probing, black's block at B will make it harder to invade the area around A.]
;B[qp];W[qn];B[pn];W[qr];B[pr];W[ql]
(;B[ro]LB[qk:A]C[Jon:  The upper part of the right side is a lot bigger than the corner, so it'd be better to defend the black stone at A and let white live in the corner.]

(;W[rk]C[Jon: Because of the impending attack black can launch on this group and the bottom white stones, white will need to gain more breathing room in the center, so the hane from the other side is recommended.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[qi];W[pl];B[rm];W[rl];B[no];W[mo];B[nm]C[Jon:  This move is very "sharp", separating white's groups effectively and setting up a good attack.]

(;W[ri]C[Jon:  Pushing again on the second line is not recommended, it's only getting a point or two for white, but is also giving black more strength towards the outside.

(;W[qb]LB[ic:A]C[Jon:  A key mistake, white must attack black's invading stone at A and prevent it from separating the top without a fight.]

;B[fg];W[dd]LB[ad:A][be:B]C[Jon:  It'd be better to hane at A first since it's a sente, opening up a threatening cut at B after black blocks.

There isn't too much else to comment on in the endgame, so this is the last comment before the end of the game.  Please skip to move 271 for the final comments and closing summary.]

[bs][cs][ds][es][fs][gs][hs][is][js][rs][ss]C[Here are the most important points for this game:

1.)  When you're double approached by your opponent in one of your corners, in most cases, you'll want to move out the corner stone into the center immediately and avoid defensive moves that try to protect it (e.g. move 32 at white C-5), as they only yield a small amount of points and allow your opponent to strengthen his approach stones.

2.)  Two of the more important fights in the game (black's invasion on the bottom and white's invasion on the right side) were impacted greatly by simple decisions of which direction to block or hane from.  On the bottom, the key move was move 50 at white N-3.  By not covering the invading black stone from above to maintain connectivity with your other stones, black was able to separate white's bottom stones into two groups, which hurt a lot.  When dealing with invasions like these, unless your stones are strong enough to try preventing your opponent from making a base, it's safer to let the opponent live small and maintain the connectivity between your stones.  

For the invasion on the right side, the key move was move 76 at white S-9.  Because white was under pressure and didn't have a large escape route, it would be better to hane from the outside to stretch out the escape route a little wider and make sure the stones get out safely.  If you already have sufficient room to escape and your nearby stones are stable, then a hane underneath may be more reasonable.

Thank you very much for allowing me to review your game!  I hope you found my comments helpful, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.]
)
(;W[id]C[Jon:  It's so important to prevent black from walking right out, so attaching on top is essential to enclose the invading stone.]
))
(;W[ok]C[Jon:  White still has a lot of room to escape with, so it'd be better to move out first and gain more room to move around in the center.  You don't want to live small unless you absolutely have to.]
))
(;W[pk];B[qj];W[pm]C[Jon:  White's right side stones are much more stable now, so black will have a harder time launching an attack on them.]
))
(;B[pk]LB[lm:B][no:A]C[Jon:  Once black pulls up, white will have to worry about struggling to live in the corner.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[qo];B[pp];W[rq];B[qm];W[rn];B[rm];W[so];B[lm]
C[Jon:  White took the bottom right corner, but black strengthened the top right and can now use his outside wall to attack the white stones on the bottom, so black will be happy with this result.]
))
(;W[io]LB[gn:A][ko:B]C[Jon:  Shifting over the stone a line to the left poses two threats against black at A and B.  While having two separated groups makes the fight tough for white, this makes it a little easier.]
))
(;W[lp]TR[go][gp][dq][eq][fq][gq][cr]C[Jon:  Instead, covering on top will make it easier for to stay connected with his other stones while buiding outside influence to attack the marked black stones with.  It's okay to let black connect back to the enclosure on the bottom right if he wants, white is more concerned about the upcoming attack.]
))
(;W[dn]C[Jon:  Since the bottom has the largest amount of potential territory, white can lean on black's left side approach stone to build towards the bottom.]
;B[cq]C[Jon:  Invading the corner right away is black's simplest response, he'll want to get settled without too much mess.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[do];B[bn]C[Jon:  This result is similar to the one in the variation a move ago, it's reasonable for both sides.]
))
(;B[cq];W[dq]C[Jon:  White has a lot more potential on the bottom, so I'd prefer to block from this direction.]
;B[cp];W[do];B[cm];W[em]C[Jon:  Black gets a reasonable base on the left side while white has a nice framework starting to develop on the bottom.]
))
(;W[co]C[Jon:  Bumping black's approach stone is white's best choice.  White can protect the corner while pressuring the two black stones from above and below.]
))
(;W[gc]LB[ef:A]C[Jon:  Extending lightly from the corner allows white to grab a footing, but it also mitigates the potential damage black can cause with the kosumi at A.]
;B[ef];W[cj]LB[cg:A][dh:B]TR[cc][cd][de][ef]C[Jon:  White no longer needs to defend the top left corner, all black can do is reduce it, so white switches his focus to establishing a base for the stone at A.  The pressing move at black B is no longer as powerful because of white's current move, so black's marked stones aren't feeling totally useful.]
))
(;B[ef]LB[dc:A][cg:B]C[Jon:  Moving out the approach stone immediately is a more effective response.  Now black can bother either of the two white stones at A and B.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[dh];W[ci]LB[dh:A]C[Jon:  This result is more reasonable for black, the pressing move at A will indirectly provide some help with any fighting or moyo building in the center later.]
))
(;B[jp]C[Jon:  Extending along the bottom allows black to spread out from the right side, creating a nicely developed framework.]
