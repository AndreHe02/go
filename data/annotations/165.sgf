(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]AB[pd]C[This is
a good game for both players.   The main lesson revolves around the choices by both in the 1st invasion.
White should never invade so deep so early. And Black let White intimidate
him.

Even so, White's early, deep invasion costs him strategically. And Black
proceeded to play well enough to win after
that.]US[Brought to you by IGS]GN[sigh-oba]RE[B+Resign]PW[sigh]WR[5k]PB

(L16) seems unusual for the Chinese opening. The development after b
(Q14) is standard.]
(;B[kd];W[ic]C[Black a (O16) is  inconsistent with his
previous move.  O15 maintains a loose connection among the black stones and
forces White into a low position.

Still, b (O15) is also an odd move. This is due to the nonstandard nature
of the previous move.]
(;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[ke];B[kf];W[je];B[pc]C[White 19 is a mistake. It is way too  early. White is trying
to keep black from turning his moyo into territory, but b  (K4)
accomplishes much the same thing and is absolutely safe.]
(;W[pi]C[Note that Black b (P16) is sente to capture 4 white
stones.  Therefore, black 20 is  defending something that needs  no defense.  
Since black can play b any time, he should play c  (O10) to enclose 19.
Even if White lives inside, Black will be more than compensated by his
resulting outside thickness.]

this sequence because White's original move is a
mistake.];B[nk];W[li];B[lk];W[jf];B[kg];W[kj];B[jg];W[np];B[lp]C[oba: I  was tempted to play simply q5 but thought it was too

The cut does not work You could play a ko at P1 but it is a very bad ko for
you.];W[lq];B[kp];W[jq];B[kq];W[kr];B[jp];W[iq]C[Your
containment plan will work if you play b (J4) first. J4 is almost sente
because, if White tenukis, Black will double hane the two white stones.]
