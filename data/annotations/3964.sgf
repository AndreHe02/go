C[Hi Ben, thanks for sharing your game with me.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pq]C[I didn't want to play another hoshi stone, because I've got some lingering fear of ni-ren-sei vs. ni-ren-sei games after losing a few in a row recently. This was the only other move I could think of. Although, now I think about it, I suppose 3-5 and 4-5 would have been playable. With a Black and a White stone on the adjacent corner hoshi stones, which 3-5 and 4-5 points would have worked best? My guess would be q5 and r5.

schwa: yes, Q5 (or symmetrically E16) is definitely better for working with the Q16 stone, P4 is not as good.  I think playing high (Q5 or Q4 or Q3) is better than R5, but I'm not a pro so I don't really know.]
;W[ed]C[I really felt this move was asking for some profound response. It didn't seem to be working well with White's other stone, but I couldn't tell which corner was more important: the lower right or the top left. What was the proper direction of play at this point?

schwa: I agree, E16 feels wrong.

I would play C16 immediately and then, following the result there, decide how best to develop the Q3 stone.

Alternatively, you could play a chinese fuseki (Q9 or R9) and just ignore white's funny move, but I think C16 is more assertive.]
;B[qk]C[I decided that it was a fair bet to play here and start work on a moyo.

schwa: Yes, this is certainly OK too, but it doesn't take advantage of white's E16 move.  Now white gets a little bit of the initiative because white can choose how to develop that funny corner.]
;W[nc]C[I thought this was a good way of working with the 4-5 stone in the top left. I was tempted to reply calmly with q14, but I felt that would be letting White dictate play, and he would find some way of building a framework spanning from o17, through the top left corner, down to d4.

I considered c16, with the vague idea of forcing White into overconcentration, but I figured I'd be more likely to help White make an efficient moyo at the top.

In the end, I decided upon a pincer, but I really don't know where it should have been. If I had to try again, though, I think I would play on the fourth line. Perhaps L16.

schwa: L16 seems overly aggressive: you are trying to start a fight where white has more stones.  I like your Q14 idea best, to work with R9.  Then white has to defend O17, and you still get a chance to come in at C17 or C16 so white's top area isn't so big.

C16 immediately lets white build strength and be more aggressive around Q16: first defend with Q14, then if white tries to make a moyo, you can invade safely.]
;B[lc]C[This seems to give white the outside influence he is looking for: white can jump out and then press down on M17.  White's outside influence destroys your Chinese fuseki moyo: M17 feels inconsistent with R9.]
;W[ne]C[I suppose White jumping into the corner was too much to hope for, so I should have thought more about this possibility.]
;B[pf];W[kd]C[And now I didn't want to crawl along the third line, because White's 4-5 stone at e16 was in the way.

I considered pushing and cutting, starting with m16, but again I thought that with the support of White e16, I would be at a disadvantage (and I couldn't read it out).

So I switched to the top left corner. One of the things I'm most interested in in this game is exactly when I should have activated this stone.

Some variations included, just to see what might have happened.

schwa: L16 is a pretty severe move.  Letting white play L17 would be very bad.  I like your pushing out and cutting idea; I agree that crawling on the 3rd line gives white the perfect relationship with E16.]

(;B[cd]LB[kc:C][cd:A][ld:B]C[White can probably get sente in this corner and then play L17, a big gain for white.]
;W[df];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[ng]C[The idea here was to play on the junction line between the two moyos, to increase mine on the right while reducing White's at the top.

schwa: but playing here is just signing a death sentence for M17.  Without M17 on the board you could play like this; with M17 it feels like your stones are attacking each other.]
;W[be]C[White played this move so quickly and confidently, I was left wondering if I should have played another move in this corner to enlarge it?

schwa: no, leaving the corner is OK, white has this forcing move which you answer at B16 but that's the price you pay for getting O13.  Black can play B14 instead of tenuki but tenuki is fine.]
;B[bd];W[mp];B[po]C[At this point, I could see White ending up with a large framework from n4 back up to d14, but I didn't want to let him break up my moyo.

schwa: Yes, Q5 takes territory and makes white's N4 stone weak, so it's a great move.]
;W[jp]C[White's three stones all on the fourth line seemed to have some weakness, but I could think how to make use of it. I suppose I could have played f3 some time if I needed to.

schwa: right now the left side is bigger.

More importantly, though, white didn't answer O13.  Now is the time to put M17 into some motion: there are 4 black stones vs 3 in the top right, though white has the support of F16/17 so you can't be too aggressive.]

(;B[cn]LB[ck:B][cn:A]C[I figured c9 would work, but I thought White would jump at the chance to secure the lower side with a move like c5 or c6.

schwa: black can capture B15 later, in which case stones at C9/C12 will look silly, too close to black's strong corner.  So white answers C9 at C7 and black becomes overconcentrated.

C6 seems like a good idea but I would rather play at the top.]
;W[cl]
(;B[en]LB[en:A][cq:B]C[I couldn't let White seal me in.

Agreed: that would make white K4 strong.  At this point you still think you might be able to attack it.]
;W[fp];B[dk];W[bp]C[This seemed irregular. I suppose it threatens to connect with c8. I wanted to find a move that attacked the b4 stone in sente so I could settle myself by capturing c8.

schwa: C5 is the usual way to threaten to connect.];B[bo]C[I don't know if this was the move, but White responded...]
;W[cp]C[White has given you a HUGE gain here: white solidified the corner a bit but your outside group becomes very solid.  Effectively white has played C4 (a slow move indeed) and then answered your endgame move of B5 at B4 instead of ignoring it as he should at this point in the game.]
;B[ck]C[Was this the right way to capture? After playing it, I considered larger scale possibilities like d10, perhaps.

schwa: no, capturing solidly is the right way.  If C8 somehow escaped later you would be sliced into two very weak groups instead of one very strong one.]
;W[fk];B[ld]C[good timing, though your bottom left group is still a little fragile after F9.]
;W[ke];B[oc];W[kc];B[le]C[Should I have just connected underneath with o18? At least White would have lost sente if he wanted to save hist two stones.

schwa: I think connecting underneath is better, yes, because it solidifies your big corner and still threatens M15 later.]
;W[lf];B[kb]C[In hindsight, I'm not sure why I played this move. I think because it made White m18 not work, but I don't know what the relevance of that is.

schwa: right, linking up is still big.];W[jb];B[mf];W[lg]C[White seemed to let me have his two stones. But I think I had to defend my weakness still, and White had got good influence.

schwa: white got influence, sure, but black has a strongish stone at D9 to neutralize it, and black gained a pile of territory too.]
;B[me];W[lb]C[If White wanted his stones back, it would be in gote. I figured there were bigger things to worry about.

schwa: I agree, this is endgame, ignore it.];B[ei]C[Was this the right way to work my way into his moyo?

schwa: how about starting around O11? This makes your territory and strengthens your area.  If white defends around M11 then you can still play this move after that anyway.

When moving into a moyo like this, I try to avoid leaving weaknesses behind: I would play E10 maybe, letting white have some territory if he wants to talk on the 6th line.  The territory between F10 and M10 is not so big.]
;W[el];B[dl];W[em];B[dn]C[Was this a good way to defend?

schwa: I'm not sure, but it feels better than D7, no doubt about that.  Now you can move out more aggressively from E6.]
;W[fn]C[...or white can take gote to stop you from moving out from E6.]
;B[fo]C[Is F5 really bigger than, say, F12?];W[eo];B[mh]C[I think here I was trying to cover my weakness a little while still enlarging my territory a little and reducing White some.

schwa: yes.  I think O11 is the move locally.  F5 looks like a big mistake: the F5 E5 exchange looks better for white, who gets very strong if G5.]
;W[pj]C[I remember thinking: "Right. Here is my chance to attack." White seemed to be in too deep.

schwa: yes, this stone is weak but you don't want to attack too hard...]
;B[pk];W[oj]
(;B[mb]LB[mb:A][mk:B]C[Trying to cover the weakness. See variations.

schwa: this feels like a tenuki.  There's a reason the pros play black S11 so often: compare it to white R10!!]
;W[ka];B[mk]C[I think o8 was realy the way to go. So much simpler.

schwa: O8 does not look pretty, and this does.  It feels like you are using your N12 stone when you play here, and wasting N12 if you play O8.]

(;W[rd]LB[rd:A][mg:B]C[Could White really have realised so early that s16 could help him?

schwa: WHat he's doing with this move is threatening R13 (almost making eyes on the side) or stuff around R17 (making life in the corner).  He's saying he's willing to give up P10 if he can live up in the corner instead.  So it's a good flexible invasion now.  This is why I like S11 instead of N9: then white doesn't have this kind of move.]
;B[qc]C[I think s14 would have worked.

schwa: this is certainly easy on white.  R13 next and it's almost life for this group.]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[nk]C[Was cutting right?

schwa: yes, of course you have to cut.];W[qj]
(;B[pl]C[Was the solid connection right?];W[qg]C[Is there some way to kill here? Or at least make White run away with a weak group?

schwa: once white gets R10, R13, and S16, I think he's alive.

So the answer is to play S11 in the beginning, not to play N9.  Then YOU get territory on the side and you can chase white's weak stones right into the moyo.

Remember, the point of attacking is to get territory, not to kill groups; here you were trying to kill the group.

Let white live, but let the living be painful.

Chase white out into the center and destroy white's moyo while you take just a few points on the side.

If white's moyo is destroyed, then the few points are enough.]
;B[qf];W[rf];B[rh];W[rg];B[rj];W[qh];B[qi];W[rc];B[rb];W[qd]
;B[pc];W[qe];B[pe];W[se]C[I was impressed.

schwa: yes, white lives here, but I'm not surprised: you enclosed, so he lived inside.  And your territory evaporated, and you didn't really do that much damage to white's moyo.  Black's lead is gone.]
;B[pi]C[Is this gote big enough to be worth playing?  I guess so, since it makes the N9 stone strong so it reduces white's moyo.  But in that case maybe playing N7 or something is better?  Or L9?]
;W[go]C[Was this really a big move?

schwa: yes, now white can play without fear.  Otherwise if black goes here then all kinds of cut threats start to be possible.  Still white has to be confident of his lead to make a slow move like this.  It's almost like a declaration of victory.]
;B[mr]C[Was it correct to slide like this, or was there a better reduction or invasion?

schwa: this is VERY big endgame since it makes territory for you while taking away white's.  After G5 you surely can't get away with moves like H3 or H4 ... that's why white's move G5 was big.]
;W[qq]C[This move helped White in the end. But could he really have seen that so early on?

schwa: this kind of move (Q2, R3, or R4) is a standard probe: no matter what you respond, there's some way to use the stone later.  It forces you to pick a course of action earlier than you want to have to choose.]
;B[qp]C[This seeed like the obvious response, but now I wonder if p3 would have been better.

schwa: if you go this way, then white Q2.  If you go P3, then white R4 later can just about live in the corner (at worst a ko).  So, every option has its risk.]

(;W[nr]C[This move seems weird; I guess white intends to sacrifice.]
;B[nq];W[mq]
(;B[lr]C[This must have been wrong, looking at how it turned out.

schwa: way too aggressive, with R3 lurking back there.];W[oq]
;B[np]
(;W[pr]
(;B[op]LB[op:A][pp:B];W[pp]C[What's the best ko threat?

schwa: resigning looks good.

Seriously, if black lives the gain is just the M2 stone; if white wins the ko, black's entire world is destroyed.

So black has lost a lot here.];B[sg]C[white can ignore this one and fill the ko; if black kills white's upper side, white still has all the cuts like R5 to take even more profit down here, not to mention the M2 and N2 stones being pretty well dead.]

(;W[sc];B[pq];W[dm]C[Should I respond?

schwa: I think black loses no matter what at this point.

But now that white played T17, black has T12 as a ko threat too, right?

so you might as well answer once more, yeah.];B[or];W[cm]C[I'm interested in anything you have to say about any or all of the moves I made in keeping what was left of this group alive. Or similarly if White missed stronger attacking moves.

schwa: black managed to gain a bit on the lower side, but white is threatening to take over the entire left side now: not sure this is a good trade.]
;B[bl]
(;W[bm];B[ch]C[good idea for black, aim at B14 and C15 area.]

(;W[fh];B[fi]C[Trying not to get shut in.];W[gh]C[white gains a lot of points above G12 now, plus he has defended with B13, plus has captured the B5 stones.  White gets sente here, obviously, then plays K2 or so to take that chunk of territory and it's all over.]
;B[cg];W[cf];B[bk];W[eb];B[db];W[fb]
(;B[bb]C[What would have happened if I had not played b18?

schwa: good gracious, this is way too hard for an amateur like me to read out.  But see my amateurish variations for some of the ways you might die.  On the other hand, those variations also seem to show that with D16 (instead of B18) you would live ... or at least get a ko ... it's hard to read out.  This is a good safe move anyway.]
;W[eh];B[gj];W[hj];B[gk];W[ki]C[Seems to secure a lot of territory.

schwa: yeah, but K2 area is still probably bigger ... this might be the losing move for white.]

;W[ek];B[cj];W[di]C[Giving away a stone, no?

schwa: ultimately you'll fill in your own territory to take it, and in the meantime you might have to worry about eyes so you might have to play A10 (again filling your own territory).  So I think it's fine.]
;B[ir]C[Probably not worth playing.];W[js];B[aj]C[D11 is a sente point: without it, you play D11 and then you don't have to fill your own territory at A10, so you have 5 points here.  Now later you have to play C11 AND D11 to fill, so you have 4 points.]

A very impressive win for black: white's loss in the lower right ended up bigger than I thought it would (from the M2 and N2 stones) and black's loss due to the ko threat was not as big as I thought... interesting.  

I think white had some chances for bigger gains in that ko fight -- or, even better, white probably had ways to avoid the ko in the first place and just live down there while cutting off the M2 stones.

That was certainly the turning point of the game!

I hope my comments are at least somewhat useful.  I encourage you to write me if you have any questions or comments about my comments: I'm eager to learn as well!
