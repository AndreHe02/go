RR:  Ok.  I'll do my best!

Currently, and always 5 kyu.
Using cgoban under SOLARIS];B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[eq]C[RR:  Maybe a play in your own corner, rather than attacking would be better here.
One rule to remember, if you are behind, attack, if you are ahead, solidify.  Since
its the beginning of the game, you definatly are not behind.  I would probably
play at the P17 location.];W[gp]C[High narrow pincer is for building a wall?
RR:  And for attacking.  Here, if Black runs towards the middle, White will
get territory on the left side.  I'm not familiar with all the variations from this
corner attack.  I tend to avoid it.  Good play by white I think]
;B[cq]C[Dive for the corner. :)
RR:  yes.  Again, I don't know the josekis here.  But this seems playable.  Usually,
Black will end with sente, and since White doesn't have a stone at D10, black  can play in that area, nullifying white wall.]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[ep];B[gq]C[RR: Best to take your sente move at B4 before this jump.]
;W[fq]C[RR: Good cut by white.];B[fr];W[fp];B[hq]C[Again, B4 seems to be calling out.  If you don't play B4, protect your cut by playing
G2.];W[bq];B[br]C[RR:  As White, I like this position.  See the 3 black stones (C3-E3) are very weak.]
;W[gr]C[RR:  I think White should play at D10 here.  Getting the Moyo is much bigger
than the two stones at G3,G4.  If black wants to save the two stones, that means
that White gets to play 2 big moves in a row.];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq]
;W[er]C[RR:  Big move for white, but I think D10 is bigger.  I've looked, and its hard, very
hard for Black to protect this area, especially after White takes a big point.]
;B[dr]C[RR:  Does Black need to play here?  Might be better to play at h2, and then extend
toards the Q3 stone by playing at M3?  I think that the corner is still alive if Black
doesn not play D2];W[fs];B[oc]C[Often when I don't know what to do, I shimari. :)  Is there a better move?
RR:  This is a good move,  probably one of the top 2 moves on the board.
Other thoughs.  D12, D15.  But there is nothing wrong with this move.]
;W[qj]C[white invades in front of my (relative) strength...]
;B[qn]C[My stones at the top are stronger than my single stone at the bottom, so I drive white toward the top.  Good thing?
RR:  Yes.  Always drive stones into your strength.  This move is a little weak though, it is
far away from Q3, and not really attacking R10 hard.  Attacking the lone white stone isn't very easy.
 Maybe repay the favor and go and play d12?];W[qg];B[ci]C[I'm worried about white's wall building something HUGE, so I invade here.  A kakari in the UL seemed too far from the wall to help much.  Is there a better move?
RR:  Usually here is how I look at it.  How far away can I get from the wall, and still be able
to make a 2 point extension in either direction.  So, you would would play ad D12, if white
attacks from the bottom, black can still extend to D15.  By using that logic, your stone at
C11 is a bit too close to the wall.
A kakari in the UL doesn't seem out of the question.  White would try to force you down towards
his wall making territory on the upper side.  Since you have a stone at P17, and the white stone
is already on the 3rd line, the upper side doesn't seem that attractive for making lots of territory.
So, maybe a kakari at D15 wouldn't be out of the question.]
;W[cg];B[cl]C[White drives me toward the wall...  Sort of like what I did.  But I notice white extends farther in approaching the invasion
RR:  White extends farther, but leaves a cutting point at C15.]
;W[hp];B[co]C[I see if I'll be allowed to connect
RR:  While it looks like the ladder is in your favor, don't forget about the net.
W C6, B D5 W E6 captures black
A better move might be to extend one to J3.  making the string harder to
capture.  White may eventually caputure it, but Black can use some forcing
moves to get some outside influence.  Even right now, a Black move at K3 wil force
W to capture.];W[qe]C[RR:  I don't understand this move.  If white wants to extend, the the upper side
is MUCH bigger.  But capturing the black stone at C5 is even bigger.]
;B[pe]C[RR: good move];W[pf];B[oe];W[of];B[re]LB[bn:A]C[In retrospect, this feels small. Would an extension be better?  Or A?
A is definatly big, however I would have continued to extend at O15.  Right
now, white and black are in a struggle to get ahead, so never give up.  Either extend
to O15 or hane at O14.
S15 is a big move though.];W[ne]
(;B[od]C[RR:   I hate empty triangles!  Maybe play at Q17  If you are worried about a cut,
then just capture at R14!];W[cn];B[bn];W[ao]C[RR:  Nice move]
;B[an]C[RR:  I would play at the other side, A4.  The reason is that now your eye at B3 is in trouble.
Time to give up the B6 stone.];W[do];B[bm]C[My middle left group feels a little stronger at least.
RR:  I disagree.  If anything, I think it is weaker.  Again, the empty triangle.  Maybe instead
of playihng at B7, first atari at A4 to keep your eye in the corner, then play at C7.  If White
wants to capture your B6 string, then you can force white to do so, and you would get a
wall at a8 and b8.  I think this is just bad shape, and weak.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[iq]C[I'd given up on those stones anyway
RR:  I guess W is worried about eye space.  Had Black played at this spot, it would
have been harder to capture these stones.];B[nd]C[RR:  This is too short.  Again, the empty triangle.  Black can easily jump out
to N16, or even M17.];W[me];B[md]C[RR:  Black is pushing White from behind.  This is good for white]
;W[le];B[jc]C[RR:  I think this jump is too far.  A small knights jump to L17 is safer (but who ever
won a game by being safe?)
Later in the game, this weakness became an issue.];W[nq]C[RR:  A nice play by white.]
;B[nr]C[I've seen people do this, so I thought I'd try it out - but I was worried white would hane (see variation)
RR:  This is a good move, but I'm not feeling very comfortable about it.  I can't really explain.
I guess since you are strong in this area, and white is (somewhat) weak, it is a bad idea to attach.
(You should only attach when you are weak, because it will make you strong.  If you are already
strong, then attaching will only make your oppt strong.)  maybe a move around O5, jumping out
into the center and forcing w to respond would be a good move.]

(;W[mr];B[or];W[eg]C[white's center is looking enviable...]
;B[gc]C[RR:  Good territroy move.  If you are worried about the center then extend from
the left side, or cap the right side at P10.];W[id];B[ic];W[hd]
;B[gd]C[I'm kind of hoping to run into the center...  Later, allowing white to poke in here cost me, and I didn't get into the center.  :( Oh well.
RR:  you've got two ways into the center right now, once from the left side, and one from the lower right
side.  I'd use one of those two to break out into the middle.]
;W[hc];B[hb];W[jd];B[kc];W[ge];B[ed]C[RR:  These series of moves make W strong in the corner, and give Black nothing.  Maybe  an attachment here at D16 is needed?  Hard to say]
;W[dd];B[ee];W[ff];B[de];W[ce];B[jj]C[Too far from land?
RR:  Yes.  Maybe a simple jump to E11?  How would white stop that?
But I like Black's attitude!
Lets take a quick look at the score:
B  LR 15 + LL 4 + L 4 + U 31 = 54
W L 19 + UL 16 = 35

So, Black has more territory, but white has more influence.  If White
can get 20+ points in the center, then white wins.
Blacks goal should be to minimize the points given to white in the center!]
;W[fj]C[RR:  Gee, wouln't it be nice if Black played here.... (the enemy's vital point is my own!)]
;B[mk]C[RR:  This move doesn't do much.  Maybe a shoulder hit at Q9, and have W push you
to this position?  (White will get some points in the center, black can't stop that.  The name
of the game now is limiting those points.];W[ql]C[I probably should have moved here before jumping on the center.  Yes?  No?
RR:  See previous comment.  This move is small for territory, and not big on
influence either.  But, if youshoulder hit now, W can keep B from connecting.]
;B[om]C[RR:  Black is close to W strength.  Maybe a move around O5 or O6 would be better.]
;W[nl]C[I was afraid of that
RR: Don't you hate it when that happens?  Looks like now you won't be able
to connect, so try to live in the center.  The best way to do that is to peep
all of whites weaknesses, which aren't that many.
I would push the w stones down, by playing B N8];B[nm];W[ml]
C[RR:  This is only going to make your center stones weaker.]
;B[mm];W[ll];B[lm];W[kl];B[km];W[jl]C[RR:  Not sure what this got B.  The 2 center stones are basically dead, and W got
55+ points in the center.]

;B[po];W[rn];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp]C[RR:  B gained back a few points, but not enough.]

(;B[dm];W[fm];B[gm];W[fn];B[gk]C[So I'm going to try to make life in white's huge center moyo. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'll try. :)
RR: and thats how you learn!
Here is what I'm looking at:
E9 group ony has 3 liberties.  You can press that group to get strong.
K8 group isn't connected to anything.  You can pressure that group
M3 group might be capturable if your M7 string gets strong.
Right now, the capture at R14 is sente.];W[di];B[aj];W[hl];B[hk]
