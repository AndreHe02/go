C[Dear Reviewer,



I played white in this game.

I think I played the opening very badly so

I would be happy if you could tell me which moves were wrong, why they were wrong and where they should have been played.



In the middle game there were a few fights.

Could you please give some comments on my tactical and strategical mistakes?



Thank you vey much for reviewing this game.

(;W[oc];B[me]C[I think this result was very bad for me because black had a nice wall and a nice extension from it and I only had a little territory. How should I have played to avoid this?]

(;W[co]TR[jp]C[The shimari is a small move. Allowing black to play K4 would give black a clear lead.]
;B[fc];W[df]C[Black invaded at c15. Was this a good invasion and should I have played d15 instead of d14?

D15 certainly is more solid, but neither is correct at the moment.

The theory behind sansan fuseki is that once you played it, you can ignore it even if black approaches it from the side. Take sente and play a big point in the lower side, before black perfects his moyo.]

E18 does not attack very well, and the lower side has been due for almost 20 moves. ;)]

You shouldn't be able to kill him here. If you don't manage to kill, he'll have oblitirated your whole moyo.]

If you don't see any way, and you have looked hard, then it's better to let your opponent suprise you then play "safe" moves. That's atleast how i play.]
