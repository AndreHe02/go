pajaro: Hi. In this game I played black, against an opponent two stones stronger than me. Although I think I did quite well (I won :) I'd like to know my weak spots in the game, as I felt I was winning fairly larger than the actual result.
Thanks

bink: I understand that you are proud about your game. But if you really want to learn from your mistakes, send games were you lost! Play against a stronger oponent, concentrate very much on the game, and send the game when you lost! When you won, all is fine.
Try to understand the situation of the reviewer: when your opening succeeded, even if it was not perefect, what should he write? He cannot really critisize it, as it worked out. If your oponent found a way to exployed some weekness in the opening of you, the reviewer can write: "See here! you made a weaker move here! Later in the game your oponent used that weakness for that attack!" That is not possible in your game.
Or in the endgame: When you are behind, you have to play an optimal endgame to catch up. when you are more then 5 points ahead, you are allowed to play weaker moves, if you feel they give you a safer win! Go is about winning. So I cannot critisize the endgame either.
So your first and biggest mistake: You sent the wrong game. You could learn more by sending other games. So please excuse if I send less comments then I usually would.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pj];B[pl]C[pajaro: May be pressing from upside, towards my shimari?
bink: You are playing from the right direction. I would have played R8, which makes it more difficult for white to settle the group.]
;W[pf];B[nc];W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[fq];W[ql];B[qk];W[pk];B[qm]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[pm]C[bink: This is a very bad move by white! The atari should come from the other side. The white stone on Q7  is worth nearly nothing and your black stone on P8 is worth a lot. Black gets a huge corner.]
;B[ol];W[rk];B[pn]C[pajaro: Now white is quite safer, and I... well, did I get enough? I guess no.
bink: White is safe, but black got huge profit.];W[om];B[nm]
;W[on];B[oo]C[bink: whites moves are absolutely silly! running in a ladder that doesnt work just increases your win. now you also got some central influence. Already here: Black has won the game.]
;W[jq];B[lq]C[pajaro: The ladder has a very bad aji. I know I'm supposed to capture the sooner, but...
bink: As you know yourself: capturing with O6 is the better move!]
;W[hq];B[fo];W[dq]C[bink: White is playing much weaker moves then black. white should keep pressure on the two black stones by playing D6.]
;B[fc]C[bink: This move is not good. The fight at the lower side is not finished. Whoever plays there first gets an advantage. Good black moves: L5 (or L4) or F7]
;W[df]C[bink: Also white should play on the lower side.];B[ic]
;W[dc]C[bink: Very bad move by white.];B[dk];W[dn];B[dh];W[eh]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[ei];W[fh];B[ch];W[ff];B[fi];W[fg];B[cm]C[bink: F7 would be better. Your F3/F5 stones are weak! Connect weak black groups. C7 is to territory oriented. you are miles ahead in territory anyway.]
;W[cn]C[bink: bad move. E7 is better: whites best chance is to attack the black stones.]
;B[bf]C[pajaro: Necessary?
bink: No. F7 is necessary.];W[fd];B[gc];W[be]C[bink: white should play the lower side.]
;B[fm]C[pajaro: After not answering to W B15, I think I should not have played B14. Right?
bink: No. Good move! F7 is correct. It is a little late, but as your oponent slept long enough, it is good. Maybe even better would be L4 now. (white will answer, and then you play F7).]
;W[bg]C[bink: all this are endgame moves. The lower side is more important.]
;B[cg]C[bink: better L4. But you are winning anyway.];W[cf]
;B[bh];W[lp]C[bink: Finally a good move by white. Black should answer N3. The ladder is still good for black after N3. Check it out.]
;B[nn];W[mq]C[bink: white saved his weak stones (Black slept). But black is far ahead.]
;B[kq];W[kp]
(;B[mp]C[bink: N4 is not good. The stone has no meaning. Why didnt you play N2? After N2 would still be a little pressure on white.]
;W[mr];B[nq];W[mo];B[np];W[bm];B[cl]C[bink: Ok! The endgame starts now. Black is ahead.]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[ho];B[go]C[pajaro: I tend to not play defensive moves like this one. It usually gives me a lot of trouble later, but, is it really necessary?
bink: Good move.];W[hp]C[bink: bad move. makes the last black move a sente move.  White should play a move like S17 or M17.]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[kn];B[lm];W[dr]C[bink: How much more stones white wants to add? Not the biggest move.]
;B[nr]C[bink: Good! White should have played there.];W[lr];B[eb]
;W[db];B[ld];W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[ph];W[qh];B[qi];W[qj];B[pi]
;W[ri];B[qg];W[rh];B[pg];W[rg];B[qf];W[re]C[bink: Why not S14?]

;B[mh];W[ni];B[jh];W[jf];B[mf];W[me];B[mg];W[le];B[kd];W[hf]
C[bink: Not necessary. Maybe M11 would be better.];B[kj];W[li]
;B[ki];W[ml];B[ll];W[nl];B[lj]C[pajaro: Actually, that group couldn't die. There were many friendly groups to link. What could I have done instead?
bink: J8! J8 also keeps the link and gives some central teritory]
;W[ng];B[oh];W[je];B[ms];W[kr];B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[cb];B[ec]
C[pajaro: B mistake...];W[ed]C[pajaro: ... and also W. I played E17 because I thougth  That would gave me  E16 in sente. But I think it doesn't work. But W thougth it would :)
bink: right.];B[al];W[bn];B[im];W[gi];B[gj];W[hj];B[hi];W[gh]
;B[hk];W[ij];B[ik];W[ii];B[hn];W[af];B[ih];W[hh];B[io];W[ip]
;B[gr]C[bink: Count: black: 29 lower right. 22 upper side. about 20+ center and left side.
white: 16 lower left. 20 upper left. 6 upper right. about 10 lower side (after whites next move), 3 more captives. Black is more then 15 points ahead.]
;W[hr];B[hs]C[bink: This move (with the follow up) lost you some points. (maybe 6 points)]
;W[is];B[gs];W[gq];B[fp];W[fr];B[km];W[jo];B[in];W[el];B[fk]
;W[em];B[fl];W[ek];B[ej];W[ah];B[bi];W[dl];B[ck]C[bink: zero point move. but if you feel safer with is: Ok, as you are far ahead.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[sm];B[sn];W[sl];B[rn];W[ig];B[er]C[bink: White should answer E1. I stop comments here. The game is over anyway.
If you really want to learn something: Better send a lost game.]
