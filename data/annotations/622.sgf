;B[eq]C[Normally, e3 would be at e2 for better eye shape.];W[br]
;B[cs];W[gq];B[fp];W[hp];B[gp]C[playing contact like this strengthens w and weakens k4]
;W[iq];B[ho];W[jq];B[ip];W[hq];B[lp]C[i feel that m4 is not effective.  better would be h6 or g6
to guard against w g5.

also f2 to secure a base for this black group must be
considered.];W[go];B[fo];W[gn]C[now w splits black into 2 weak groups.]
;B[fn];W[hm];B[hn];W[fm]C[w should just connect at g7, why let black link up?

w's group can still run to the center...];B[gm];W[gl];B[em]
;W[gn]
(;B[el]C[d6 would be better - it prevents the cut at e6 and still connects
with d9.

see variations.];W[cm];B[dn];W[cn];B[kp]C[it would be better to play a large opening move like
o17, r17, r6, q10, r10, or o3.];W[lr];B[nq];W[mq];B[mp];W[mr]
;B[op]C[once again b forces w to secure his stones.

contact fights against weak, isolated stones always
strengthen the opponent.];W[pq];B[pj]C[good, continue the opening]
;W[pm];B[jc]C[this is inconsistent with q10.

q13 or r14 would be inline with q10];W[oo];B[nr]C[this move is slow, it does not develop b.

a better local move would be 05.

even better would be a move in the upper right,
o17,  r17, r14,  q13, q14, ...  these are all worth
thinking about.];W[fq];B[ep];W[mm]C[now that b o2, w f3, b e4 have defined the borders for the
lower w group, i'm not sure it is alive.

needless to say, there are many black ko threats here.

note that the black group at the bottom has no clear eyes
yet.  as the game progresses, b must make sure that
eyes develop for this group.];B[nc]C[good!];W[qf];B[mj];W[jl]

(;B[jj]C[it is easy for w to cut this line apart.

i would play r12, then r8 to secure a base. and follow with p13.
this gives b some shape to build upon (see variation)];W[gj]
;B[hk]C[this peek encourages w to connect and does
nothing for b as played in the game.

i would look at c13.  this starts a b moyo on the left and
indirectly supports the lower b group.];W[gk]
(;B[ig]C[my go teacher used to make me chant  "corner, sides, center.
corner, sides, center".   a nice follow through to b h9, w g9 is shown in the previous
variation.  since you peeped, you should at least follow up
with some plan.];W[ii]C[now another contact fight.

notice how it strengthens both sides.];B[ji];W[ih];B[jh];W[jg]
;B[if];W[kg];B[ng]C[good, w appears to have trapped himself.]

;W[kk];B[ij]C[you should play m13 at this point.

the o12 group has 2 liberties and is easily attacked
(as you learned later).

secure it now and use it as a base to attack w.];W[hi];B[hj]
;W[gh];B[fi]C[save threats like this for use later.

here you should capture at m13];W[gi];B[nd];W[oc];B[lc];W[nb]
;B[mc];W[oi]C[now you should really worry about the o12 group!]
;B[im];W[il];B[hl];W[gm]C[after this exchange the k10 group is surrounded and
can be attacked.  m13 secures it.];B[lk];W[jm];B[kj];W[lg];B[of]

;B[lq];W[jr];B[ks];W[mr]C[wasted move. n2 and m2 are miai.]
;B[lr]C[now black has saved his group - but at what cost.

the right side is w territory.  d2 will secure the lower w group.

b cannot secure enough territory in the upper left to even
things out without killing the g12 group of white's.];W[dr]
;B[bq]C[this is a wasted move.

maybe f14 to hem in white's center group and start the attack.

you must play from a distance and fence w in to capture him.

the contact fight that follows is messy and ineffective, so
I'll stop my review here.

two key points for you to ponder:
1) "corner, sides, center"
2) avoid contact fights against weak stones.];W[bp];B[bk];W[ej]
