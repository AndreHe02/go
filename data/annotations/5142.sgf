AB[pd][dp]C[Organos[16k\] vs. Asroc [18k\] on kgs

r:  Hello, this is rcarn and I'll be reviewing your game.  Overall, you did well (as the final score suggests), but I'll try to address your questions and point out a few places where you might have tried something different.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nq]
(;B[qm]C[r: This response is fine, but I tend to prefer the small knight's move just since I'm a little more familiar with the followups from it.  I added them as variations to maybe give you some ideas.]
;W[fq];B[cm];W[jq];B[mc];W[cf];B[ci];W[kc];B[ic]C[L17 was to close to my stones and j17 is the correct answer, right? But I'm afraid, I made some mistakes with the next stones.

r:  This seems ok to me.  White's stone is pretty weak from here.  Your corner isn't really secure yet, but with all the space around it, I don't really see that as a problem.]
;W[gc];B[jc];W[kd];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[mb];B[nc];W[nb];B[lc]

(;W[oc];B[od];W[pc];B[ne];W[qd];B[qe]C[Would there have been a way to prevent white from gaining the corner?

r:  See comment at 30.];W[rd];B[re]TR[kc][kd]SQ[ma][na][oa]
[pa][qa][ra][sa][ob][pb][qb][rb][sb][qc][rc][sc]C[r:  In this position, I think I prefer black's outcome to white's.  White has made roughly 15 points in the corner, but black has a lot of influence built up and the two marked white stones are extremely weak.  Black will earn many many more points considering.  However, your L18 group could come under attack too, so you might want to think about defending that next.

Losing the corner territory isn't always a bad thing.  See the edit for an example.]

(;W[qb];B[ie]C[r:  Good play.];W[kf];B[ig];W[qg];B[qi]LB[qj:B]
[qk:A]C[r: I like this idea, since R13 seems a bit of an overplay to me.  My only concern is the weakness at A.  2 point extensions (to B) are pretty common on the 3rd line, and would also put a lot of pressure on white's R13 stone.]
;W[og];B[mg]C[r:  Another good play; keeping your opponent's weak groups apart is always nice for you.]
;W[kh];B[mi];W[oi];B[pk];W[ok];B[mk];W[qj];B[pj];W[qk];B[pi]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[rk]TR[qj][qk]C[r:  White has made an empty triangle here; not good shape.  It seems he's hoping to later turn S10 into an eye, but that's not really the greatest strategy when you can play T11.]
;B[pl];W[rg]
(;B[qh]C[r:  See variation here.];W[sh];B[sj];W[rj];B[kj];W[rm]
;B[rn];W[ql];B[sm];W[pm]
(;B[qn]C[r:  Capturing S7 here seems good to me.  You'll be ahead 3-2 in liberties.]
;W[ol];B[om];W[oj];B[pn];W[ph];B[pm];W[nf]C[This stone lead to the connection of the P11 group. Would there have been any way to prevent it afterwards? Or should I have connected the s15-stones before? When?

r:   See variation at 74 for one possibility.  With the weakness you have at O8, white can probably get this group out anyway, so killing was probably unlikely from here.]
;B[mf];W[me]
(;B[le]LB[nl:A]C[r:  This stone is maybe the only opportunity to keep white from living, but with the possibility of escaping at A, I don't know that other moves would work either.]
;W[oe];B[md];W[pe];B[nd];W[rf];B[mm];W[qq]LB[pr:A]C[r:  With the strength you have right above that, this is an overplay by white.  Probably better for him to slide at A.]
;B[pq]C[r:  Great response.];W[qp];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rs];B[sq]
;W[so];B[ro];W[rp];B[sp]C[This stone wasn't needed, was it?

r:  No, I don't think so.  T2 and T4 look like miai to kill.]
;W[no];B[lo];W[mj];B[lj];W[nj]
(;B[lh];W[ki]
(;B[ij]C[Here start the troubles that lead to the connection of the L12 group. Should I have connected at M11 instead?

r:  I don't really like M12 since it gives white the nice move of L11.  See variation at 98 for another possibility.]
;W[li];B[ke];W[lg];B[mh];W[jf];B[if];W[ii];B[hi];W[ih];B[hh]
;W[jj]C[r:  This looks bad for white.]
(;B[ik];W[jk];B[ll]LB[kk:B][lk:A]C[r:  The solid connection at A is safer here, if for no other reason than to deny white the easy forcing play at B.]
;W[kl]C[Here my concentration failed, because I wanted to prevent the connection to k3.]

;B[nl];W[ln];B[lm];W[kn];B[mo];W[ko];B[np];W[mp];B[oo];W[lp]
TR[nn][lo][mo][oo][np]C[r:  The marked shape you have here is a nice one since you don't need to defend it.]

(;B[fn];W[eo]
(;B[do];W[en];B[em];W[dn];B[cn];W[dm];B[dl]TR[cm][em][fn]C[r:  Be careful making contact plays on defense; it can lead to the "squeezing out the toothpaste" effect you see here where your opponent just pushes through the gaps you leave.  Thankfully, it seems you have enough support in the area to keep the weakness of this shape pretty well managed.  Compare with the variations.]
;W[cl];B[el];W[ck]C[r:  This is unreasonable by white.];B[dk]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[bk];B[al];W[am];B[bi];W[co];B[bo];W[cq];B[cp]
;W[bq]C[r:  A big gift from white.  C3 made C5 a nice sacrifice by threatening to take the corner, and D3 here would have sealed the deal.]

;B[ds];W[cs];B[bj];W[es];B[ak];W[ep];B[co];W[ap]C[r:  A free move from white! :)]
;B[dg]TR[gc][dd][cf]C[Should I have made a invasion at C17 instead to gain the whole upper left corner?

r:  I'm not very familiar with the nuances of white's marked corner enclosure, so I don't know offhand if C17 would necessarily live for you.  Given the lead you've maintained to this point, I think this is a fine play.  It reduces white's influence and secures some center territory for you.]

;W[bd];B[bg];W[jn];B[jm]LB[il:A]C[Not necessary, because both groups already live. So there is no need to connect them and there are bigger stones. Right?

r:  That's a good point.  Staying connected is useful, but connecting two live groups can be counterproductive.  Still, at least this was reverse sente for you (a white move here would force you to fill a point at A.]

r:  Overall, very well done!  You were maybe 20 points up until you pulled off those big endgame moves, which turned it from a close game into a big win for you.  The main weak spots in your game seemed to be in defending, though you certainly managed on the left side just fine too.
