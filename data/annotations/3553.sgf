C[hello, dear reviewer

after analyzing the game myself i found a number of severe tactical mistakes which together lead to my defeat. i pointed them in the game and gave some comments and ideas on how i could have done it better. i'm still sending a game for review, so you can give your opinion on those mistakes and proper moves (and maybe other mistakes i didn't notice). also i'm interested in your opinion on my strategical decisions and understanding of proper direction of the game. i played white here.

thank you in advance,
vasily
 
Dakre: Hi, the fact, that you spotted some of your own mistakes yourself says, that you have the potential to do better... so you probably are still in the time, were the rank development is quite fast ;)
but for now, let's start with the review...];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[cd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[po]C[Dakre: very good so far... it is very important for white to prevent the black shimari here.]
;B[oo];W[on]
(;B[no]LB[op:A]C[Dakre: the usual joseki looks like the variation at A.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[qq];B[pm];W[oq]C[Dakre: here you should think of the possibility of just connecting at q6. The cut at p3 stays dangerous and you have your head out into fresh air... 
it is better to stay connected with the centre than to be forced to make two eyes... 
while staying connected you keep black seperated and black has a weak group on the right side to worry about]
;B[nq];W[or];B[pn];W[nn];B[mo]LB[mo:2][nn:1]C[here i thougt that corner is stable and two stones are not that important, so i take a big point

Dakre: the importance of these stones shall not be underestimated... they are cutting stones and so they keep black weak on the right side. But saving them gives black some profit... so again, the connection probably would have been good.
when you think of tenuki, then don't play the exchange of 1 and 2... it strengthens black.]

(;W[jd]LB[hq:B][nr:A]C[Dakre: look at A... it is sente for black and almost sente for white, because black already has some kind of framework at the bottom. A play here is very big for both sides as it is sente and black's framework stands or falls with it.
Imagine white playing here... when black ignores this play, the framework is gone and white has a follow up at B for example ( B has two escape routes ).
When black answers, he can't answer at n2. And even after that, n2 is gote for black.]
;B[nr];W[pr];B[qo];W[qp];B[ro]C[Dakre: this is a good result for black]
;W[nc]TR[cj][ec]LB[dn:1][ci:B][cl:A]C[is this move ok, maybe better c10 or e17

Dakre: The problem with e17 is that it invites a black play at A or B for example. But then 1 is in a bad position and should be one line lower on c6.
c10 seems a bit too defensive and therefore a bit slow, but you're right, it is quite big. Nothing to argue about o17 ;)]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[hc];W[ec];B[jc]
(;W[pf]TR[mg][nf][oe]LB[kc:A]C[this attack is pretty good, but c10 is still very big

Dakre: with this play you invite a black splitting attack on the marked line, which creates two weak white groups, because the one on the upper side just lost it's base :/
I'd like the idea of defending first and then invade the right side... black's group on the upper side is weak and you should strengthen yourself before the invasion by leaning on it like in the variation at A. After that you don't have to worry about any damage, you could do to this group and you can just concentrate your forces on the attack.]
;B[ph]LB[nf:A][ng:B]C[Dakre: connect... ;) for example with A or B]
;W[qc];B[oe]C[Dakre: now black has found this nice move :/]
;W[og];B[of];W[pg];B[oh];W[ng];B[nb];W[qd];B[ne];W[me];B[mf]
;W[le];B[nf];W[lf];B[mb];W[kc];B[ic];W[pb];B[ob];W[kb];B[mg]
;W[nh];B[lh];W[mh]C[invade the right side?
c10?];B[lg]TR[me][le][lf][if]LB[lg:2][mh:1]C[Dakre:
three reasons why 1 is not such a good move:
1. your marked group looses a liberty
2. black was connected anyway
3. wrong direction...
your right group is strong, it has the corner, while your other group still is weak.

to your question:
invading the right side may be too agressive, because you already have one weak group. Something like c10 or C9 ( i like the latter better, because it strengthens the bottom and black would have a hard fight by invading between these two strong corner positions ) is very big now.
I'd like to play sth. around the J14 area... you're strengthening your weak group while attacking the three black stones above.]
;W[nj];B[pj];W[nl];B[ok];W[nk];B[mm];W[ol];B[pl];W[qh];B[qi]
;W[rh];B[ri];W[oi]C[Dakre: usually black ignores this to take sente... this is endgame ;)]
;B[pi];W[dj]TR[if]MA[jd][kc][le][nd]C[i played d10 which is probably not as good as c10, because it's easier to live between shimari and this stone

is this move big enough, or is it better to continue atacking h17 and m12 groups?

Dakre: I'd still like a play around J14... when black runs with those three stones, you can build territory on the lower side while attacking it. Further you don't have to worry about the marked group anymore]
;B[dg]LB[he:C][fe:B][if:A]C[Dakre: bad timing for black... white can attack the three stones on the upper side simultaneously to the invading stone... but now A is too slow... B is splitting both groups apart, but weakens your right group, because black will run into the center while cutting your way... so I'd like C most :>]
;W[fe]TR[jd][kc][le][nd]C[Dakre: good shape anyway ;) and this probably would have been the best move when the marked group would just have been a little bit stronger...]
;B[he]
(;W[jf]TR[fg]C[what about f13 instead of this?

Dakre: then black probably would take the point, you played... this would almost connect his two weak groups, what makes both strong and probably even kill your upper group...
you seem to oversee the danger that you're in here... even when you survive black can take profit with chasing your weak group... so defend early when you see the need to... only a few things go over a solid connection ( but they're not part of the game :-) )... otherwhise try to get enough room for eyespace... white does not have enough without the move you played.]
;B[hg];W[if];B[hf];W[jh];B[fg]TR[dg]C[Dakre: just because of the weakness of your upper group black managed to connect the lonely stone at d13, but black forgets about his own weak group, too ;)]

(;W[pe]C[m11?

Dakre: yes, m11 looks nice ;)];B[pc]
(;W[lc]C[i did this to get sente after r18 r18 q19 and cut at p16, but maybe better just connect and continue attacking the whole thing

Dakre: after the cut it's blacks turn to play l11... so when you just defend at r19  black may run to l11, too... black is always one step ahead here... the question is what is better... with or without the tail... but as the tail is alive anyway, I'd save q18 or run with your upper group further into the centre.]
;B[qb];W[rb];B[pa];W[od];B[ki];W[ra];B[qa];W[li]TR[gi]LB[ii:A]
[kk:B]C[Dakre: bad move :/
I'd like A and B... but A more than B ;)
A attacks the left and the right group at once and black would probably play around B then what gives white the chance to shut in the upper black stones with something like G11 next]
;B[lj];W[mi];B[kh];W[kj]C[Dakre: this weakens yourself on the upper side more and more!!]
;B[jj];W[kk];B[ji];W[ih];B[jk];W[kl];B[gj]C[Dakre: now you have a serious problem :/]
;W[hi];B[hj];W[ef];B[eg];W[ch];B[mc]C[black is attacking my group, which i manage to save, but i exchange corner for three black stones in the process. the exchange is pretty bad for white.
do you see any better line of play?

Dakre: the line of play is to come...
now there is only escape, killing sth. black nearby or death... no way to make two eyes for white here...]

(;W[md];B[kf];W[ke];B[kg];W[id];B[ie];W[hd];B[gd];W[gc]C[Dakre: very good cut]
;B[gb];W[fc];B[ge]
(;W[je]C[after this move i lose the corner. probably giving up h11 stones would be better...
what do you think?

Dakre: yep, it is better to sacrifice them as to loose the corner... but a variation shows you can have both... ;) but you just should go the save way here, when you're not able to read that this is not an overplay...]
;B[fb]
(;W[ia]LB[eb:A]C[Dakre: why not blocking at A? you don't have to know that this capturing race will favor white... but you should know that this gives black a dead shape and would die unconditionally if white was alive...
the second step is to think of the capturing race ;)];B[eb]

C[here i thought that it would be polite to resign
my count was something like B+12, so i decided it's impossible to compensate that now

Dakre: I get a similar count... the bottom left may have won black the game.
A few things, i'd like to say to this game:
1. Take a look at your weak groups... even when they can not be killed, they can be chased and forced around what gives profit aswell...
2. You found some of your own mistakes, what is very good... just try to find them while you're playing and you'll improve a few stones in a hurry
3. Your feeling for the opening is already quite good until the point where you decided to invade the right side and leave your upper group undefended. There is a proverb saying that you should not create more than one weak group in the opening ;)

at last i want to say, that this is my first review and it's probably not like what you expected. I'd be happy about any feedback regarding questions, what is unclear, about a variation or what i could do better in my next reviews... ;)
have a nice day and keep playing... :)
