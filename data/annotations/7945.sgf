;W[ic];B[gd];W[hd]C[I learnt (pro-lecture) that this move is good for B. I would like to know if I used it properly in the following moves.]
;B[he];W[hc];B[fd];W[dh];B[di];W[fh];B[ei];W[ff];B[gf];W[de]

C[Black A better, this move actually weaken white G17 group.

White B only mean alive in gote.];B[bc];W[ch]LB[kb:A]C[In this position, I would play L18...

Reason being: I place emphasis on attacking over big move... 

You can always play big move (like Q10) later when you get sente after the attack.]
;B[pj]C[My judgement at this moment:
- W is practically alive in upper left, but B has sente.
- W upper side group is not yet completely settled, likewise B upper left, but B and W are easily out in center.
- B has big potential area in upper right and some territor on left side.

Overall I considered B position at this moment as ok, actually (slightly) ahead.

Is this right?

I find this move rather slow, but nevertheless it is NOT a bad move.]
;W[eb];B[fc]C[Crude move, locally D18 is better...

Or you can just tenuki.];W[fb];B[op]LB[pn:A][qn:B]C[Huge move, B is ahead

Here, white should consider A or B.];W[oq]
(;B[nq]C[When played, I immediately regretted. I think it is a good position for another joseki:

Yes, I agree.

White P3 is wrong in direction.];W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[jq];W[rd]
;B[qd];W[re];B[rc];W[qh];B[qj];W[pf]LB[om:A][pm:B][rg:C]C[Black should consider playing A or B, creating an influence while connecting Q10 group to O4.

The next objective is to aim at the weakness of white at C.]
;B[oh];W[nf];B[oe];W[of];B[me]LB[rg:A]C[Slow move.

One way is to play A to destroy the base of white, even while white had ran out, but white still not having 2 eyes and is in an unstable state.]
;W[mf];B[le]LB[mh:A]C[White A better.];W[ql]LB[rg:A]C[Black can consider playing A.]
;B[ol];W[om]LB[nm:A]C[Black A better, if white cut, you fight.]
;B[nl];W[nm];B[mm];W[pl]LB[ml:A]C[Black A slightly better.]
;B[mk];W[mh]
(;B[nj]TR[fc][me][nq]LB[rg:A]C[from this moment on I have the impression that slowly but steadily the game is less and less under my control
territory-wise I think B is - at this moment - well in the game, but somehow...
instead of acting I re-acted, and had at the end of the day all over the board broken shapes... and culminated in terrible mistake at move 129..., B S13 is the only move

My question here is a general one: What went wrong? Where are my mistakes? Wrong judgement globally - meaning play in wrong direction/ at wrong places - , and/ or just reading mistakes, eg on left side after W C9?

Actually black should play A now, O10 is good shape but slow move.

My advice: 
1) Read up on crude moves and how to avoid making them (e.g. F17)
2) Choose the correct direction (e.g. Q4 over O3) 
3) Make moves which are important (life and death), severe (meaning creating an attack later) and forceful (opponent tenuki means something dead)]
;W[je];B[kg];W[li];B[ig];W[jh];B[jg]LB[ri:A]C[White should play A here for safety.]
;W[bo]LB[rg:A]C[Still black A to attack.];B[bn];W[co];B[dn]
;W[mn];B[nn]C[Nice cut.];W[on];B[no];W[lm];B[ml];W[kn]C[Bad move, this is burden for white.]
;B[kk]LB[jj:A]C[White A better.];W[ii]LB[jj:A]C[Black should peek here at A.]
;B[ik];W[in]LB[gi:A][ri:B][jo:C][jn:D][gp:E]C[White has A or B miai...

Black is better off playing C first then E.];B[gh]LB[hh:A][hi:B]
[gi:C]C[Black G12 is rather strange...

Black A, white B then black C.

A simpler way to cut off the connection.

Anyway, white has S11 then S13 to settle...

This is why I emphasized black S13 earlier.];W[gi];B[hh];W[hi]
;B[fi];W[eh]LB[rg:A]C[Slow move by white.

Last chance for black to play A.];B[gk]LB[ri:A][rj:B][rg:C]
C[White A, black B then white C.];W[lf];B[ke];W[kf];B[jf];W[jd]
;B[kh];W[ki];B[jj];W[ji];B[db];W[ri];B[rj]LB[rg:A]C[White A is honte.]
;W[fk];B[gj];W[fj]LB[fl:A]C[Black A better.];B[gl];W[fl];B[fm]
;W[ck]LB[el:A][bi:B]C[Black A easier.

Guess white is trying to make hane at B sente...];B[dk]C[Wrong move.]
;W[bi]LB[bj:A][cj:B]C[Now, if you block at A, white can cut at B.]
;B[el];W[cj]LB[dj:A]C[Black A better.];B[ek]LB[rg:A][jo:B][jn:C]
[gp:D]C[Still tough game for white...

If white A then black B, white C then black D...];W[lq]LB[lp:A]
C[OK to play A.];B[mo];W[kp]C[Now I feel white has reversed the game.]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[mn]LB[rg:A]C[White A is honte.];W[hp];B[nh];W[rg]
LB[lh:A]C[Black can cut at A...

Did you misread or you are in lousy mood after the mistake (N5)?]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[mg];W[lg]LB[lh:A][ng:B][mi:C]C[Still black A...

White cannot get both B and C.];B[ng];W[lh]C[track [2k\]: thank you for the game
ainoyama [1k\]: thx

Sorry to keep you waiting for this review, hope you find my tips helpful.

Best regards,

(;B[jf]C[maybe better, B is connected and keeps pressure on W, meaning B has sente to play eg in lower left corner, for example 3-3-point or kikashi B4-C3, then E6
actually there is nothing at O11 area, meaning O10 slow move

You could be connecting 2 groups which are alive... 

This is certainly slow move.]))
