;B[pc]C[Hi, my nickname shade.
I will do the review for both sides.


The main things I could say:

1. Too much useless slow moves after attack has ended.
2. Play form the dead stones.
3. Both players left much weaknesses in their poisitions and this tends to fights.
4. Both players miss urgent moves to punish opponent and this tends game to be close.

I think White has advantage from the middlegame, but can't take profit from that advantage.
Maybe White made more valuable mistakes and Black was more lucky.


If you have any questions left - feel fre to e-mail me.

Best wishes, shade.];W[cq];B[op];W[cd]C[White takes too low position, as for me..
Black on the other hand has too influence oriented position.

Position equal to this point.]
(;B[cf]TR[pc][op][cq]C[Black had choosen right board half - upper side looks better to attack, but bC14 isn't common move and in this situation seems wrong, because of marked white stone and low postion of wC16.
Disadvantages of C14 attack:
 * wC3 is is too low and it will be hard to attack from the upped side;
 * also there is no black stones on the side to make bC14 efficient.
 * the only way, I see to make bC14 move good - is to start corner approach with bD4.

Better variant in this situation will be bE16 or bE17. Look variations.]
(;W[ee]MA[fb][fc][eb][ec][fd][gd][gc][gb]C[wE15 is too aggressive move and leaves weakness from the uper side.
I would prefer more calm moves to get territory and then tenuki.]
(;B[eg]C[Very important thing in any case - to get base on the side..
So, if ti is possible, try to make base and then prepare attack or tenuki.]
;W[di]C[White plays too aggressive and now it will be one more weak group..]
;B[fi];W[dk]
(;B[dq]C[I think it is better to stabilise upper group before starting attack... Anyway, attack also possible.

Such close approaches commonly used if where are much opponents stones nearby. 
This Can be good if there were white stones, for ex. at K4 and C6 (see variation).]
;W[dp];B[eq]
(;W[jd]C[Yes, this is good tenuki.
White also can get a bit better position making exchange wF14-bF13 at first.]
(;B[pj]C[Also Black can attack White's corner, while White leaves big weakness at C4.
Or stabilize own left group.]
(;W[jp]C[This seems useless and slow move for White.

More interesting points to continue in variations..]
(;B[jo]C[Actually, I can't see what Black wants to do with that move.. And it is seems useless.
White's K4 isn't dangerous and doesn't so big for replying on it. Better to tenuki.
See variation on other possibilities.

By the way - Black shouldn't afraid of attack on bE3 group because it is easily live on the side.]
;W[io];B[ip];W[ko];B[jn]
(;W[lp];B[jq];W[kp];B[hn];W[iq];B[hp];W[nq]
(;B[ir]C[This is good move - now White don't have a base.. but White can easily attak corner or run away.
I think defending corner is bigger.]
(;W[or]C[Yes, this is good start for White, also possible to make live on ther side or run to the center (or even live in corner).
Look through variations..]

;W[kq];B[hq];W[kn];B[no];W[in];B[jm];W[im]C[Wrong direction - it must be L7 to run away.
Also seems better to run a bit earlier - wK7 rather then wJ6. Those 2 stones are not so interesting.]

;B[kl];W[jk];B[hm]
(;W[fn]C[Too far away - White should play closer..
Now Black can punish for that move with C4.];B[ho]C[This is useless, Black should tenuki C4 or R15 or somewhere else.]
(;W[fp]C[This isn't good move, considering weakness at C4..
Better to tenuki.];B[ij]C[This also looks too slow for Black.
While fight is over Black should take bigger points..

As rule says - at first corners then sides, then center.
Also looks good bF14.

For Black I also like Q15, Q12, R15, C4, M16.]

See variations, following joseki.

If you can't see how to kill and defend your position better don't even start attack.]
;W[qc];B[qb]

(;B[of]C[Useless, because White's Q14 is captured in a ladder.
More valuable move - bP16 to build wall.];W[md];B[ld]C[I don't like this move.
Again, C4 seems much better.
Another possibilities - F14, N18.
Or if Black wants to start attack, then better to play far moves, like H15/H16.
If Black want to try cut wN6, then wJ16, I think could be possible, but it will be hard..

Also Black can use own thikness and make territory on the upper side, maybe from K17 or H16..]
;W[le];B[lc]
(;W[mf]C[Yes, this is possible, but if Black cut L15, then it will be bloody fight.
