C[Chris: Dear Reviewer,
thank you very much for looking at this game. To me it felt like I was not pressuring my opponent at all. I guess with better endgame I might still have won, but really the mistakes must have happened before. Please point out anything you find peculiar. "Meta-Comments" about where you think my ideas are misguided, would be very much appreciated (hence which part of the theory of the game I need improving on).

I played Black and lost by 0.5 points with reverse komi.

Chris

Hi, I am Dusan.
This is interesting game to rewiev.
My commens will start with a *.
If you don't understand my comments you are welcome to ask questions.My E-mail is guta@medianis.net]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[ep];W[po]LB[pl:A][qm:B]C[Chris: I am not so confident handling a situation like this situation. What are the options here?

*Here you can play pincer for example A or B because of your stones at Q16 and E4, there is no reson to be afraid of fight.]

(;B[np]C[*This is not bad move in any case.];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]
;B[or];W[ql];B[dn]C[*The question move at R8. You should try not to make it good...]
;W[eq]
(;B[fq]TR[np][pq][or][qr]C[*The group is strong on right side (there is no good move to attack this group) so you can start fight with D3 to use your strenght.

This move makes good tickness but you must be cearful not to get overconcentrated.]
;W[dq]
(;B[gp]C[*It is better to connect solidly at F4. Now there is H3 for white that will help him to invide bottom.

Also move at R8 is now good. If it is at R8 you would have a forsing move at P6 making big moyo in centre. This way you can only play P7 here.

R10 is no more sente for black.]
(;W[qf]LB[nc:C][cf:B][bo:A]C[Chris: Is a move at A and then approach at B the correct order? Should the kakari in the top right be answered at all?

*It is not bad to answer kakari.

R8 was good move.Now white made a mistake in direction of play. Right side isn't important as black R10 is not sente. It would be good if white R8 was at R9, then it would protect R6.

Since white played this way answering kakari is good.You are moving to direction of white star point stone.

If you play A and B white will play another approach at C and then answer B.]
;B[nc];W[rd]C[*This side is not important]
(;B[cf]C[*You should first play B5. However this is right direction of play as O17 is low and top side is less important than left. If it was at O16 than F17 would be right side to approach.]
;W[bn]C[*Slow];B[fd]C[*Good idea. Because stone at O17 is low it is good to play high for better balance.]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[ed]
(;B[cd];W[fc]LB[kc:A][qh:D][cj:B][on:C]C[Chris: Now I did not know what to do. Options that came to my mind were A, B, C and D but none of them seemed very appealing. I felt like Black has little development potential anywhere on the board right now.
I did not like A because it felt to be not consistent and pose no threat to white. In fact I thought it would provoke white to protect the right side which I did not want.
I didnt like B too much as the low white stone on the left will inhibit any terretory I make there.
C (or thereabout) did not seem like sente and an immediate reduction would make this move pointless.
I guess D would have been ok, but I wanted to wait what happens on the top left with Whites group there.

When white has thickness like here in the top left, what is the correct way to handle it? Build counter-thickness or make a solid group from which to erase a possible future moyo?

*You are right about B and C.

A is not a bad move because it limits white tichness, also white has M17 forcing black to enter san-san then builds big moyo.]

C[Chris: I was not happy about the ladder, but I thought I have to break up the side. If White played a protective move there, I thought it would become to big.]
;W[jo];B[jq];W[ph];B[jm];W[pi]C[*Right side is very big.];B[qk]
C[Chris: This was an attempt to make thickness on the right (which failed).]

(;W[hc]LB[of:A]C[Chris: I am very unsure about this move.

*There is a weakness in black position at A. So white can play K16 aiming at weakness while building more teritory.]
