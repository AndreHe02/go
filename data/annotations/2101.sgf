;B[pp]C[Just a quick intro.  I'm pretty new at go and am not sure how to advance my game.  I'm beat pretty consistently by players that claim to be my level.

Hopefully, these comments will be helpful.  Discliamer:  as is standard in English, I have used masculine pronouns to refer to the players since I don't know anyone's actual gender.]
;W[cp];B[pd];W[dc]
(;B[qj]SQ[ce][de][fd][eq][ep][dn]C[tried to extend but i guess I went a little far... wasn't sure what kind of move to make at this point in the game

    This is not a bad move, just a bit passive.  It is too far from each corner to expect to hold the whole right side without adding more stones.  White can't afford to let black to have time to secure the side, so this move by black is, in essence, begging white to invade.
     A more standard move by black would to approach one of white's corners.  Each of the squares would be a good option for black. See the variations for some possibilities.]
;W[qf]
(;B[pg]C[I try to corner him in and then kill the group

This is a bad idea.  White should have enough room here to either make two eyes or run out into the middle.  Trying to kill a group and failing is rarely a good strategy.  Instead, plan to harass the group while making profit elsewhere.  See the variation.]
;W[qd];B[oc]TR[pe][pc]SQ[qc]C[to passive maybe?

Yes, if black really wants to kill white this is too passive. The square is better for killing.  Remember, however, that trying to kill is not necessarily the best strategy.  Either of the triangles is good for applying pressure to white while making a nice wall.]
;W[qc]TR[ce][cn][fc][eq]SQ[jc]C[Now white has enough space in the corner to live.  Black should stop playing in this area and move on to bigger things.  The best move is not always near your opponent's last move.  Look at the whole board for the best move overall.  The square takes advantage of black's sort-of wall in the right upper corner. The triangles are also all good moves for black.]
;B[ob]C[This move doesn't really attack white well and doesn't secure any territory for black.]
;W[qn]SQ[qp][nq]C[he cuts again... how do I get myself out of a situation like this? or should I never be in this sort of situation?

Black should never expect to capture the whole side with just the single stone at r10.  Don't panic over these invasions.  Welcome them as chances to harrass weak white groups while gaining territory.  Either of the squares is a good response.  Neither move attacks white directly.  Both tend to block white from the lower side and corner.  This should force white to run out into the center.  White will gain a weak string of stones while black gains solid territory along the lower side.]
;B[ro];W[qo];B[qp]C[i try to take the corner];W[rn];B[rp];W[on]
;B[nq]C[The result so far is good for black.  Black has corner territory and white has a weak clump of stones between two strong black groups.]
;W[lq]C[This is a bad move by white.  This creates another weak group for white to protect.  Defending two weak groups is difficult at best.]

(;B[mr]C[This is a poor attack move.  White can't really invade the corner, so black doesn't need to defend here.  Black has a strong corner group, while white has weak stones.  An attack by black is in order.  See the variation.]
;W[lr];B[qg]C[This is rather small.  Playing by one of the left side corners is still worth a lot more for black]
;W[rg]
(;B[rh]C[This is a small endgame move by white.  This move doesn't threaten to kill any black stones, just gain 1-2 points of territory. Black should ignore it and play a move worth more.  See the variation for one option]
;W[sg];B[sh]C[I guess I didn't do this right cause now he has loads of space to make a base.

White has been alive for a while now.  This just expands his territory by two points in gote.  Black has a chance to take Sente on his next turn.  This should allow black to play somewhere worth far more than the two points white gained here.]
;W[re];B[pf]C[This wastes black's Sente move.  Ignore this already alive group and play somewhere else.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[qe];B[od]SQ[pc]C[but I figured that if he was going to take that little bit I might as well build some center influence

This connection is not necessary until white forces it by playing at the square.   Black should take this chance to play somewhere else.]
;W[pb];B[lc]TR[nc][mc][lc][kc][jc][ic][hc]SQ[ob][oc][od][oe]
[pf][pg]C[This is too close to black's wall.  Counting the marked stones shows this wall to extend 7 spaces from the top side.  Black should then count 7 spaces over from the wall and play at the farthest left triangle.  Similarly, a wall 4 stones high would allow a play 4 stones over from the front of the wall on the third line.]
;W[jc];B[kb]SQ[hc]C[Black "dives" to the second line here again.  This is a common move for black and has been a poor choice each time.  The square is a better choice since it attacks white better.  It is also exactly where black should have played when extending from his wall.  This is still the opening phase of the game, since large areas of the left and lower sides remain unclaimed.  The opening should almost always involve plays on the third or fourth line. The first and second line are normally endgame moves.]
;W[jb];B[ka]C[Again, a small endgame move when lots of large open spaces remain to be claimed.]
;W[ja];B[po]C[This is another small, endgame move.  All it does is force white to connect.  Black gains no territory from this, and white has a more solid group.  Never play a move that only forces your opponent to get stronger without benefiting yourself even more.]
;W[pn];B[mo]C[This is good.];W[lo];B[mn]C[Black is attacking white nicely.]
;W[ol];B[oj]C[I try and run

This isn't really running for black.  Black is attacking the weak white group on the lower right while making territory on the upper right.  This series of moves is black's strongest playing so far.]
;W[ql]C[This is a bad move by white.  There isn't really enough room to make two eyes here, so white should be running for the center. Black has a chance to truly surround and kill white now.]

(;B[nl]SQ[ml]C[This is too close to white.  The square is better.  See the variation]
;W[ok];B[nk];W[pk];B[nh];W[kc];B[lb];W[ld];B[md];W[le]TR[dj]
SQ[gc][gb][ga][gd][ge]C[somewhere around here I saw the game spirilling downhill he's building some serious left side influence

One of the main reasons white has so much left sided influence is the fact that we are almost 60 moves into the game and black has yet to play even one stone on the left half of the board. If black had played farther out from his wall, white would be building this wall at the squares instead.  If black had played standard opening game moves near the left side corners, white wouldn't have such an intimidating presence.  It is still not too late for black to play on the left side around the triangle.]
;B[me];W[lf];B[lg]TR[kg][jg][ig]C[This isn't a great way to block white, but it could be the begining of a horizontal black wall along the triangles.]
;W[mf]C[tried to stop that wall and figured I had that knight's move connection to help keep his advance at bay]
;B[nf];W[mg];B[mh];W[kg];B[lh];W[kh];B[ki];W[ji]C[but alas it continues

If the current series of moves is better for your opponent than for you, don't continue.  Play a big move elsewhere, even if it means a modest local loss.  Soon it will be much harder for black to play on the left side since white will have a "roof" over that whole area.]
;B[kk];W[kj];B[li];W[jk];B[lj];W[jj];B[kn];W[ko];B[io]C[Finally, on move 79 black plays his first stone on the left side of the board.]
;W[jn];B[jo]SQ[ko][lo][lq][lr]C[Black has cut off the four marked stones from the rest of white's wall.  Now black should try to kill the marked stones.  Desperate times call for desperate measures, so black should skip the harass and profit elsewhere strategy I mentioned earlier and fight to the death here.]
;W[jp];B[in]SQ[in][io][jo]C[This does not help kill the white stones.  Black's three marked stones are cut off from the rest of black's stones.  These stones are in a "kill or be killed" battle with the white stones on the lower side.  One of these groups will have to die.  Once you are in a race to kill before being killed, don't break away until the battle is settled.]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[kl];B[ll];W[il];B[km]C[oops! didn't realize I had a stone in atari]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[lm];B[kk];W[ln]C[again didn't even see it coming

Black was probably playing too quickly and didn't stop to really look at the moves being made.]

(;B[gp]SQ[cj]C[trying to penetrate his wall while I still can

Black is better off sacrificing the three stones and playing at the square.  See the variation.]
;W[fp];B[fq];W[gq];B[hq];W[gr];B[hr];W[fr];B[ls]C[Small endgame move.]
;W[ks];B[ms];W[jr]C[but my attempts end in failure...];B[dj]
C[now I was hoping to create a live group out in the middle of this unclaimed stuff and eat up his territory

Finally!  This is not a last-resort move.  This should have been an opening game play at around move number 10-15 in the game. In fact, playing move number 11 here instead of p18 would have been a very good idea for black]
;W[dl];B[ch]SQ[cg]C[Too small.  Black must jump one space farther to the square to make eye space]
;W[cf];B[cl];W[cm];B[ck];W[dm];B[bl];W[bm];B[al]C[This is an endgame move.  Expand your group up and out before messing around on the first line]
;W[am];B[di];W[eg];B[eh]SQ[fi]C[Better, but still rather small.  The square is better]
;W[fh];B[bg];W[bf];B[fg]C[Good, this stirs up trouble.];W[gg]

(;B[ff]SQ[dg][fi]C[Playing Atari at one of the squares is better.  See the variation.]
;W[dg];B[gh];W[fi];B[hg];W[gf]C[Now black has four stones cut off from the main black group. They have no way to live.  When deep in enemy territory, keep your stones connected whenever possible.  The exception is sacrifice stones played to gain something specific.]
;B[jh]C[Play out from the live black group.  Don't make small, weak groups next to a huge wall.]
;W[jg];B[ih]C[hoping break his wall

This is like attacking the Great Wall of China with a hammer and chisel.  The actual barbarain hordes the Great Wall was built to repel never attacked it directly.  They bribed the guards to  let them pass un-molested.  The lesson is attack overwhelming force with trickery and stealth, not direct battle.]
;W[fe];B[ij];W[ii];B[hj];W[fj];B[fk];W[ek];B[fm]C[trying to live

Black spent too much effort playing stones next to white's wall. Once black decided to make a live group on the left side, that should have remained the priority.  Push outward from the live group to reduce white's territory.  This keeps all of black's stones connected to the live group.  Don't make lots of little, seperate weak groups for white to destroy.]
;W[fl];B[gk];W[hp]C[big trouble for all my stones lower left... not much space to live...]
;B[go];W[ip];B[eq];W[er];B[dq];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[dr];W[ir]
C[here I realized I had lost the lower left and thus the game since all I had was a sliver in the middle and some of the lower right corner... meanwhile I had lost all my stones in the middle and didn't think it was possible to sway the game by trying to attack the top right.   Thanks for your time!

Black played a lot of small end game moves early on and missed out on a lot of chances to play big opening game moves on the left side.  By the time black finally turned his attention to the left side, white had a huge wall bearing down on the area. Hopefully my comments have been helpful.
