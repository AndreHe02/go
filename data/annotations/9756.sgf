C[Hi! I'm Derpiplays and I played B in this game. First of all, thank you for reviewing the game. I have asked some questions further into the game.

Thanks :D


T : Hello, I am Tilwen and I will review your game. My comments will start with a T.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]C[T : This is unusual but completely playable. Black has plenty of choices, depending on what kind of games he likes more. I emphasizes on this only to point out that even so early in the opening there are lots of possibilities and it can be worth thinking about what you want.]
;B[qo]C[T : This is an easy choice, and totally fine.];W[qn]
;B[qp]
(;W[pn]C[T : White can also test Black's reaction on O17 (see variation).]
;B[nq];W[qf]C[T : White is "supposed" to play at Q10 or H10 here. The first idea for Black now is then to pincer, but the following is not so obvious and one needs to really think about the next move. The thing to notice is that a Black stone somewhere between R14 and Q6/R6 would already be pincered, what is usually not a good idea.

 I would suggest simply O17 (see variation). Now, I think pincering is also possible, but the choice of the pincer is important. If too close White can counterpincer and get a base for the Q6 stones (as what happened in the game), and I think that a high pincer is better suited to fight. I suggest then P11 or P10. Black lacks a base, but White also then it is playable. It will be a complicated game.]

(;B[qh];W[qj]C[I was confused what to do here? It was either O16 or O12 for me. What move would have been best here?

T : I think that R12 was not the best choice and it seems hard to do something here. In order to compare, imagine that White has played R10 at move 10, then you take the empty corner, now White approaches at R14, would you pincer at R12 ? But that is the result here in the game.

Let's think what can happen here. The lower White group seems safe, and if you want to keep White separated 
with Q13 for instance, White can get a nice result (see variation). I then suggest to tenuki (approaching at C6 or taking the upper left corner) and see what happens next.]

(;B[oh];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[pf];W[dd]C[T : White has connected his stones and taken the empty corner, Black has made some influence. Black needs now to be dynamic, and your approach at E17 is good I think.]
;B[fc];W[df];B[qe]C[T : But now, I would prefer to have K16 with Black. R15 is certainly big, but White can then go on the attack or build a base between Black's stones.]
;W[kc];B[ic];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[db];W[cc];B[fq]C[Correct direction?

T : I am not so sure. Black's lower right corner is already very solid so that enlarging it is not very urgent (it is only about points, and believe me, points are not important in the opening). It is certainly tempting to aim at a large area of influence on the lower side, but it is not "dynamically active" at this point of the game. The things to notice are that D4 stone is lonely so that approaching it is big, but also that White would like to have a stone around D10 in order to protect the weak point of D14 (a Black stone at C12 could be disturbing). The O16 group is also rather weak but it seems hard to attack it now. I suggest then either to approach at C6 or maybe to take the big point of C9, that makes "miai" of extending at C6 and attacking at C12.]
;W[cn];B[cl]C[T : This is a kind of overplay : both White's groups are more solid than Black's two stones no ? I think that now Black is in a difficult situation, it seems hard to save both this stones while getting more points that White.]
;W[ci];B[dr];W[cq];B[jb]C[T : This is not small, but not such important at this stage of the game. The lower left area is much more urgent. This kind of move on the second line aims at killing, but when White can easily go in the middle, the group cannot be killed. The good idea would be the opposite : put pressure and try to enclose White with L14 for instance and then be happy with him playing on the second line (line of defeat) in order only to live.]
;W[ke]C[T : This is a big point, White's group takes a big breath while reducing Black's influence.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[iq]C[T : What you got with Q9 and Q8 is not clear. Anyway, White let you take the big point of J3 and you did well to play here. Maybe H4 or J4 can aim at more potential but this is a very big direction.]
;W[em]C[I was hoping to come back in sente and finish the joseki.

T : I am not sure I understand which one you mean when writing "the joseki". Anyway, you defended F3 but C8 is now under attack, White doesn't have weak groups anymore, and Black's influence will be very hard to use.

At this point, White is late by not much in points, but is ahead in "group situation" (zero weak group vs one for Black, and nobody has something like a moyo), so that it is almost game over in my opinion. I will put some comments later, but I think that this is mainly the beginning that made you lose.]
;B[bj];W[cj];B[dm];W[dn];B[el];W[fl]
(;B[en];W[fm];B[ek]C[T : Now you struggle to save these stones and White will be able to consolidate its weak group while reducing Black's potential. Note that E6 is not such a good idea, play E9 rather and let White dealing with its potential cut (see variation earlier).]
;W[bi];B[bk]C[T : This seems small, going out at F9 is more important.]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[fo];B[ei];W[dh];B[gj];W[gq];B[gr];W[gp];B[hq]
;W[rf];B[qi];W[ri];B[ld]C[T : The shape is strange, White looks rather solid here no ?]
;W[lc];B[le];W[kd];B[ne];W[ie];B[hd];W[hf];B[ff];W[lf];B[mf]
;W[lg];B[nj]C[T : Black needs to defend a cutting point …]

T : It seems OK, but I think you both missed the fact that E11 can be cut and in big troubles here.]
