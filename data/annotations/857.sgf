C[All comments revolve around key questions:

1. preventing the bad turn in left-side fight
2. Killing/ or best result group on lower left corner
3. threats to white central group
4. pursuit of white group on left center
5. threat/timing on upper right corner
6. endgame situation before bottom move by white.

Questions 1, 6 & 2 are my tip-top priorities. Any suggestions outside
these 6 areas are 'bonus' and I'm grateful.];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq]
;W[dc];B[de];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch];W[po]C[This opening move Q5 looks a little funny to me.
I would be thinking that the top side is most important because both white
and black are high there.  So I would play O17.  But I'm sure Q5 is fine.]
;B[pl]C[A good, aggressive move.  This joseki gets awful complicated though.]
;W[qq]C[I have no idea what's joseki here, but this move looks a little
funny.  It seems that white's C4 stone is going to have limited potential
for development.];B[qr]C[Keep it simple, good.];W[qp]C[R4 feels heavy.  I wonder what the joseki is here?  I would be
thinking crosscut instead.];B[or];W[pg]C[White's lower right corner is really heavy now.  Q13 seems like a
bad tenuki to me.  Black should play Q11 and then white's lower right
corner is going to hurt.];B[pi]C[Really, I hadn't looked ahead a move -- this seems just right to me.]
;W[qc]C[Remember the three questions:
The first is "Where am I weak?"
Only in the upper right corner, really.  So you should answer R17 in a way
that addresses the second question, "Where is he weak?"  The answer is all
over the right side, particularly the lower right corner where the white
group is heavy.  So I would block at R16 here.



Leading up to question #1, this could have been an early branch. I blocked
as I did to isolate White 18 at q13];B[qd]C[Besides the attack/defense issues, white is also going to become
overconcentrated on the upper side (the high stone at F16 will lose its
prospects for development).  I would say black has the lead at this point.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[oc];B[nd];W[ng]C[White is trying to confuse you, to catch up.  Trying to make you
think that your upper right group is weak or attackable.  Well, white owes
you a move here; you deserved to come out with sente.  In fact I think at
this point O17 is probably sente for you, so your group is very strong.]
;B[nc]C[I felt this helped me negate a white upper side, contain the white
corner and still threaten the two white stones.

It also makes your group there, your one potential weakness, look like a
big pile of thickness.  You have two weak white groups on the right side to
attack, so you should be in good shape.];W[rd]C[White has to try to live; now white's right side gets even weaker.]
;B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[qh]C[Don't be fooled!  White is the weak one here, not you.  Just
patiently build strength and then nuke that lower right group.]
;B[qi];W[rh];B[ni]C[I don't think you need to worry about eye space; a weak group
between two weak groups is strong.

On the other hand I might consider starting up the fight with the lower
right, then you might be able to naturally strengthen this middle right
group and maybe even come back to cap at M13 instead of playing O11.

A suspect move. Keeping in the fight, but letting white carve out my
eyespace? perhaps this should be a s11 (a)?];W[oh]C[This is the stone that becomes k
 cut me later and I feel I should have prevented it. Perhaps just connect
here?

Yes, just connect.  White is still weak!  You could try to connect
indirectly (like at O9 or some such) but there's no reason to.  Being
strong will let you poke white's eyes out later.];B[mj];W[nb]
C[This is gote for white; a terrible move.  You can answer once at
N18 if you like, or just ignore.
This move only affects territory, really.

Actually on second thought the best move might be M17.  Then you can play
N18 later at your leisure, your group stays strong, and you continue
attacking white.];B[mb];W[ob]C[White connects in gote??? crazy!  Play M13 and the whole white
group on the right looks VERY sad.];B[ld]C[I don't think S11 is important compared to, say, M13.

If you're thinking of this move as defending the cut at N17, you are
worrying over trifles; N17 is just a few points of territory.  But if
you're thinking of it as ensuring the life of your upper right group,
that's good thinking.  Still I think M13 is a more aggressive way to
achieve the same end; will white really be able to cut that?

Perhaps this move could be spared to play at s11?];W[rk];B[ri]
;W[qm]C[Now suddenly white's lower right group becomes strong.  This is a
bad result, so S11 must be the wrong response.  Play R7 yourself instead of
S11; then white's lower right group is weak, and white still doesn't have
eyes for the upper right group.]
(;B[lg]C[And now the cut comes. This cap haunted me as the possible
premature move. I look at my favorite afterthought in the variation, but
Here is, in my mind, the point of no return for Question #1. So, is it too
late now? what earlier move really put me in such a spot?
I don't think the variation looks particularly interesting, but the lower
right group is already alive anyway, so leaning on it doesn't throw away
any opportunities.  But already the balance of power on the right is much
more even.];W[oi]C[Indeed this cut looks ugly.  If you had played R7 instead of S11
that would have helped.  But I suppose connecting solidly in the first
place is the best way.

The key point is that you let the lower right group become strong and got
almost no compensation for it.  R7 was too much to allow.];B[qk]
C[Letting yourself purely be cut through like this seems unhealthy.
Instead, play P10, and when white cuts, sac the 3 stones on the right in
exchange for cutting through at R8 and S8; does that work?]
;W[ok];B[rl];W[nk]C[This is funny shape; why not connect??]
;B[pj];W[oj]C[Now white gets the empty triangle.];B[rm]C[You get a little compensation for your loss, but not enough.  Your
center stones at M13, N10, O11 are not worth much any more.]
;W[rn];B[pm];W[mp];B[np];W[no];B[mq];W[op];B[nq];W[mn];B[nm]
;W[mm];B[nl];W[mk];B[ml]C[White shouldn't be fighting quite so aggressively here; white is
still somewhat weak.];W[ll];B[eq]C[Tenuki is a little scary here; but you do have life wher eyou need
it.  Still you've lost a lot of thickness as a result of the fight on the
right side so ...];W[gq]C[G3 is the wrong direction.  Neither side can make much territory
here.  I might even D3 and then C6 because then black becomes
overconcentrated at the bottom.];B[eo]C[Ouch!  Now black becomes weak.  I would be thinking about the
corner territory a lot more than anything else here.];W[lp]
C[M4 is very slow; C4 is the urgent stone here!];B[jr]C[It looks like you could live with S2, so why play K2?  Low,
stooping move, and white is strong enough here that G3 won't be attacked to
hard.  Howa bout C6 instead!];W[iq]C[The C4 stone seems much more urgent to me than any of this stuff.]
;B[jq]C[This pair of stones becomes the issue for question #6

This pair of stones doesn't look too valuable to me as long as the whole
corner lives ...];W[jp];B[cn]C[So, Question #2 begins to take s
l result against this corner.

Now you're talking.  Why wait so long though?  The exchanges at the bottom
have strengthened white, so they are not good for you.

White should be able to live, though, in this situation.  It's in the
joseki books if you want to know the details.  Even D3 should be enough for
life.];W[dq];B[fq];W[do]C[Now does F3 still look like the right way to connect, or would you
prefer a stone at E4?  The outside is not so important here.]
;B[dn];W[en];B[gp]C[This fight seems sloppy. perhaps time was short, or I just wasn't
too hot. I was surprised to even come out of it at all.

It looks like you are trying to gain a few points on the outside at the
expense of not making the best fighting moves.];W[fo];B[ep]
C[This exchange looks bad for white; just extending at F6 would be
better I think (the E4 stone is not good for the corner)];W[em]
;B[hq];W[gr];B[dl];W[hp];B[ho];W[hr];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[el]
;B[go];W[fl];B[gm];W[hn];B[hm];W[in];B[hk]C[Now the game starts to look interesting for black again.  There
were probably a lot of mistakes on this fight by both sides.

The more important issue, though, is that the lower side was unimportant,
and the left side was important.  I think you can see that now; nobody got
anything on the lower side, but black stands to gain a lot on the left.]
;W[io];B[fp];W[dm];B[bl]C[Such a funny-looking move, B8.  Can't white still push through at
C7 anyway?];W[cm];B[bn];W[cl];B[bk];W[bm];B[am];W[dk];B[cj]
C[So, now the corner, subject of question #2, is wating. I looked at
different things, and thought I had a good plan, but you'll see I either
chickened out, misread or both.


White looks weak again ,indeed.  B3 looks like the tempting point to me
(if white plays B4, you can C2 ... but there is a shorting of liberties on
the E3 stones.)  Anyway, I can't tell if it should die either, but B3
looks like the right place to start when the time comes.  For now the white
group on the outside is much more important.];W[gj];B[hj];W[lj]
;B[gk]C[G11, enclosing, looks better.];W[fj];B[fk];W[ej];B[hh]
C[Now you might take away white's eye with E9, white D10, C9 ... so
white is VERy weak now.];W[fg]C[Question #4 begins to haunt. Was there a better way to attack this
group? Can it yet be cut? What a bout a lean against White 6? (f16).

Yeah, F15 looks like a good move here.  You wouldn't mind sacrificing the
D15 three stones if you caught white's whole left side group, would you?]
;B[hc]C[This is a feeble move.  White is still alive.];W[ji]
;B[jj]C[Why K10?  This direction looks valueless.  Connect with G11
(sente threat to cut, yes?)];W[ii];B[hi];W[dg];B[cg];W[jg];B[hf]
;W[je];B[id];W[gg];B[hg];W[gb];B[kh];W[jh];B[ki];W[kj];B[jk]
;W[lf];B[kf];W[kg];B[mf];W[lh];B[le];W[jf];B[bq]C[And so, my attempt re: Question #2 begins.

Well at least it looks like you picked the right place to start.]
;W[er]C[Not what I expected. I noticed this, but thought the block was
just fine, but..];B[fr];W[cr]C[I didn't think of this. This was also a point I considered
starting with, instead of 151

I think the E1 atari, followed by B4 if white D2, should be OK here.
White probably has to play ko at D1?];B[es];W[ds]C[Yup :)];B[fs]
C[perhaps I should have played ko. But, I've left enough weak groups
about, I felt I'd lose a ko fight (and I'm scared of ko. Working on it).

At least take the ko once, if it's your turn first, and make white spend
one ko threat!];W[bo];B[br];W[bs]C[Now I feel like I missed a chance. End of case re: question #2

It's not over yet ; you can still fight the ko, eh?];B[hb];W[ao]
;B[an];W[al];B[ak];W[co];B[al];W[ck];B[bi];W[dr]C[OK, now it's over.  White was willing to spend a gote to save this
group, so you shouldn't be sad about that.];B[rr]C[All the groups are alive so look for the bigterritory; this is
probably biggest, a fine move.];W[kq];B[lr];W[rj];B[sj];W[sh]
;B[qn];W[pn];B[ro];W[qo];B[sn];W[rp];B[qn];W[bj]C[Life in ko, here; OK, so S2 wasn't biggest after all.  Need to
make life for all your groups before you start taking territory!]
;B[aj];W[rn];B[cq];W[dp]C[
 cricket 6k*: other direction better, gave up a point (188)]
;B[qn];W[gs]C[Didn't just give up a point; wasn't really a ko threat!  You
created one for him at the same time as you made one of your own.]

;W[ma];B[lb];W[kr]C[Yeah, there's nothing really big left to do.

Now question #6. I feel I'm behind about 20 points. So, maybe it's too
late anyway. I try to play to try for bigger stuff elsewhere, and give up
about 7 points by ignoring this. I take what's probably an exactly equal
amount elswhere, but not more, and not sente, so I still lose by the 20
points. Maybe #6 isn't such a good question after all.];B[mh]

group was never in danger, was it?


 cricket 6k*: I can't believe I missed that. A better way eluded me (266)

I realize that 261 might have been better placed elswhere. Maybe more ko
threats agains the central white group. I just now see that it has 2 eyes,
with a third available if white makes it. Makes this whole white group seem
like I might have threatened it earlier.];B[se];W[qe];B[on]

away liberties first, since my threat only works with no outside liberties,

Black fell behind when white's lower right group got an easy life; that
was the first turning point.  Then black got in an interesting fight in the
lower left corner, but let white's running groups off the hook.  At that
point it was probably over.])
