C[- Hey there,

My names Amar and I'm dn21death on KGS. I think I'm around 3 dan though I havent played in a while. If you have any questions please email me or would like to know more. I may not play that much but I like to help. =\]

Anyways, I think you had a comfortable lead after getting the left side which made the game seem easy. Im not sure if you did this on purpose but with such a lead you just get lazy and white slowly gains a bit more each time. I also think white got a lot more than you from the yose definitely. 

You should try practicing more tsumego for your reading which is always important. I think white played unorthodox moves in the opening so its hard to judge how good you were then since half the board was decided before moving to the other side. I think you handled his head first pushes fine though for the most part. 

If you read any books I would recommend "The Fundamentals of Go" by Toshiro Kageyama(I think thats his name). Its a great book which I read when I played a lot. 

So good luck!

;W[ec];B[fc];W[eb]C[This doesn't look too good for Black right? because of the cut at f15. What would be the correct sequence for Black?

-I still think you can do something alright here. I dont usually want to say play on the second line but B15 seems safe for me.]
