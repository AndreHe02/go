C[otto:I was sick when I played this game, so I wasn't reading very well. I am black.

Zombie Lincoln: Hiya! I'll mark my comments with a "Z".];B[qd]
C[otto:This is my usual opening move.];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[jc]
C[otto:This is what I am going for when I play R16 to open.

Z: Nifty!];W[ed]C[otto:I am not familiar with this joseki. I am used to white playing at E17 rather than E16, so I was caught a little off guard.

Z: White's move here makes sense.  A move on the third line is for territory, and a move on the fourth lines is for influence.  White chose a move four lines from the side because the territory on the top is hard to get, because of K17.]
;B[dc]LB[gc:B][df:A]C[Z:  This is a solid move.  But it's worth considering the marked positions.

"A" starts to claim the left side, which is still open and valuable.  It threatens to cut white off from her support down there - and pushes her towards K17, a place where you are already strong.  Uncomfortable for white!

"B" is a pincer move that is unusually nice for you because of K17.  That is, your pincer would already have a base on the top side, and be very safe!  You could then continue the attack from the left side, and make territory as you squeeze.

Still, your move seals white off from the corner and forces her to flee downwards.  An okay choice.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[ec];B[eb];W[dd];B[cb];W[fb];B[fa]
TR[dh]C[Z: Your move isn't terrible, but white can't break into your base at this point, and a move at D12 would just feel so awesome! You'd take the lead on the left side, and put a lot of pressure on white's group.]
;W[ga];B[ea];W[hb];B[ib]TR[oc]C[otto:I played hastily here, I think I should have played bigger.

Z: Yup.  White's move didn't directly threaten you, so it was a great time to finish your top-right corner with a move around P17.]
;W[hc];B[qn]C[otto:Should I have protected the top first?

Z: The order is generally,

1) Claim corners
2) Fix/attack unbalanced corners
3) Claim the sides
4) Extend your territory, threaten invasion
5) Move towards the center.

Players sometimes skip a step when they are rushing to take the lead, or correct a mistake.

You skipped fixing your unbalanced corner, but you had good reason - now that top corner seems a bit cluttered, with K17 and K18 hanging out there.

But it's really too easy for white to play up there and attack your corner while splitting your stones.  You need to attend to them.

It's J18 that should be different, not this move.];W[lc];B[lb]
LB[oc:B][je:A]C[Z: Who wants to crawl around on the side? Like a worm??

If you don't have nice territory on the ground, take flight with a move like "A"!

Alternatively, "B" helps you keep the corner while putting pressure on white's attacking stone...But, your K17 stones aren't really strong enough to continue your attack.]
;W[mb];B[la]LB[kb:A]C[Z: Avoid playing on the wall early in the game.  It's rarely the best move.  "A" is better here.]
;W[jd];B[kc];W[kd];B[mc];W[md];B[ld];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne]C[Z: White messed up in this sequence.  You're free!]
;B[qp]LB[le:A]C[Z: It's very important to let your group out.  If white seals those in, it's as good as capturing them - they will no longer be useful to you across the board.

Moving at "A" divides white's O15 stones from her K16 stones, attacking both of them, and lets your group use its strength!]
;W[le];B[ke]LB[nb:A]TR[ja][ka][jb][kb]C[Z:  Your top group only has the marked territory.  That is a dead shape.

To save it, you need to play "A".

Your move tries to break out towards the center, which would be ideal, but you're too well surrounded to escape this way.]
;W[kf];B[je];W[id];B[lf];W[me];B[lg]C[otto:Where should I have played instead of M13? Maybe J14 or j15?

Z: O18 is still necessary to keep those stones alive.];W[jf]
;B[ia]LB[nb:B][ie:A]C[Z: Doesn't help!]
(;W[ie];B[ha];W[gb];B[jq];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[lq]LB[lp:A]C[Z: "A" is preferred.  You got away with it though.]
;W[or];B[pq];W[oq];B[pr];W[po];B[qo];W[hq];B[iq]LB[lp:A][mp:B]
C[Z: No reason to head-butt the stone like this.  Better to jump out with "A" or "B", separating the stones on the right.]
;W[ip];B[hr];W[gq];B[gr];W[fr];B[hp]LB[pf:C][dh:B][cn:A][lp:D]
C[Z: Is it really worth cutting here? It seems to me you have bigger moves worth considering!]
;W[ho];B[gp];W[fq];B[fp]LB[go:A]C[otto:was this the right move?

Z: No. The cut is going to be a hassle for you, but its value is that it weakens white's K4 group, so it could eventually help you sever it from the Q5 stones.  "A" carries out that goal better.

That said, your move worked out for you thanks to a slip-up by white!]
;W[ep];B[go]
(;W[fo]LB[gn:A]C[Z: You lucked out!];B[gn];W[fn];B[hn];W[io]
;B[dn];W[el]LB[eo:A]C[Z: White could have changed the game hugely with this simple defense.]
;B[eo]C[Z: Yeah!];W[en];B[do];W[dm];B[cp];W[cq];B[eq];W[dq]
;B[er]
(;W[co]LB[cn:A];B[cn];W[bp];B[bo];W[dr];B[es]C[Z: Better just to capture.  That way, white can't manipulate you because of your lack of liberties.]
;W[ao];B[bn];W[cm];B[an]LB[jm:A][om:B][on:C]C[otto:was there any chance of saving this group at this point?

Z: No, but don't worry about it! Your cut was a victory - you killed the F3, connected your G6 stones, and now have totally severed White's L4 and P3 stones! 

Don't waste time with that group - start something severe with "A", "B", or "C".]
;W[bm];B[ap];W[aq];B[ar];W[ao];B[br];W[am];B[bq]C[Z: This looks like grieving behavior to me.  It's understandable! You've just lost a big group, and many of your plans and strategies just fell apart.  You're left staring at those empty spaces on the board, and would move anywhere to bring those poor stones back.

Better to take a deep breath, and stretch your eyes away from that part of the board.  With those stones gone, you are released! You can finally attend to the rest of the board.  And in this case, there's still plenty to be done out there.]
;W[ds]C[Z: This move was a reason to capture the F3 stones rather than just pushing down at E1.]
;B[fs];W[ch];B[bh];W[bi];B[ci];W[dh];B[bj];W[cj];B[di]C[Z: Right!]
;W[dj];B[ei]C[Z: Gold! You've struck out into the middle of white's territory! A great result.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[bg];B[bf];W[ah];B[de];W[ee];B[ce]LB[gi:A]C[Z: Unimportant! It's time now to make sure your three stones stay useful.  Help them out with "A"]
;W[bk];B[qj]LB[gi:E][pj:A][pk:B][jm:D][om:C]C[Z: All your stones on the right side are on the third line, the territory line.  You should try to balance that out by playing higher!  Even a slight difference can mean a lot to your groups that are floating out in the middle.]
;W[qg];B[rh]LB[nb:C][pb:B][ph:A]C[Z: I think "A" works out better for connecting your stones and attacking white's L4 group.

"B" I prefer for making territory.

And "C" is still hanging out, waiting to save your group up top....or kill it if white plays there.]
;W[rf]C[Z: This move splits your stones...];B[re]C[Z: And this move doesn't reconnect them.]
;W[sf];B[se]LB[pb:A]C[Z: Unnecessary.  "A" is better.];W[pg]
;B[qf];W[pf];B[qe];W[rg];B[od];W[nd];B[nb]C[Z: =D];W[ob];B[ma]
;W[oc];B[pc]C[Z: R18 might be wiser...]
(;W[pb]LB[qb:A];B[qb];W[oe]LB[pd:A][om:B]
(;B[pd]C[Z: Sure, this move gives you a bit more security, but you could get along without it and the middle is crying for attention!]
;W[qa];B[ra];W[pa];B[rc];W[jj]C[Z: White getting the first move out here was a shame =\]
;B[gk]LB[hj:B][jm:A]C[otto:I couldn't decide which side was the biggest threat.

Z: Killing the L4 stones is where the big money is.  I would have played "A", and done my best to keep the group from reaching safety.

"B" is a good compromise between connecting your stones and threatening the L4 group.

Your move doesn't do either too strongly.  Luckily, white responds with some wishy-washy moves.]
;W[gi]LB[fj:A]C[Z: She could just go in at "A" and cut.];B[fj]
C[Z: But you profit greatly here!];W[eh]LB[fh:A][oj:C][il:B]
C[Z: This move is terrible.  First, to defend the upper territory, it should have been at "A", which seals the gap much more cleanly.

But more importantly, it NEEDED to be at "B" or "C".  White's stones need to escape while they can!]
;B[hj]LB[jl:A]C[Z: "A" is a much more important cut.];W[gl]
;B[hl];W[gj];B[fl];W[fi];B[ej];W[fm];B[gm]C[Z:...but that turned out nice, didn't it?]
;W[fk];B[ek];W[dk];B[fk];W[hi];B[ij];W[ii];B[ji];W[jh];B[ki]
C[Z: And, amazing! You've cut off a GIANT slice of territory.]
;W[ik];B[hk];W[il];B[jk];W[im];B[hm]LB[oi:C][in:A][mn:B]C[Z: Nope, still no need to respond! Feel free to play "A", "B", or even "C" instead!]
;W[kj];B[lj]C[Z: Good!];W[kk]LB[lk:B][kl:A];B[lk]LB[kl:A]C[Z: Bad! Should be at "A". White can do some damage now...]

Z: There's room for improvement in all aspects, but yes: that capture was yours and it slipped away!  Your strength in Go depends not only on your skill, but also on your situation.  You'll play best when you are calm, rested, and healthy - making little mistakes is expected when you're feeling sick.
