C[This game was played between Paul Weiner and Vernon Leighton on January 31, 2006. The handicap was a 24.5 reverse komi for B. In other words, W has to win on the board by 25 to win. Therefore, B actually wins the game by 6.5 points, even though he lost on the board by 18.

;W[gc]LB[pj:A]C[$ I never like ogeima from hoshi, and prefer keima, but i can t say they are bad moves

but playing there white let black make double extension to A from its shimari. very big point now, much better than G17 because D16 stone is not yet attacked]

(;B[cf]LB[pj:A]C[$ i prefer A because it s double extension from shimari and C14 can be attack by white pincer so this create early a weak group for black]

;B[dj]
(;W[ge]C[vernon: W allows B to build a two story house, as they say. See variation for possible shoulder attack. Also, maybe M17.

$ yes but this is the consequence of letting black play K17 before White. But i agree G15 is not the right move here : does not build,nor attack.]

(;W[qd]C[vernon: IMHO this attack was too deep and only strengthened B. If it had succeeded, it would have been strong. More certain would have been Q14. See variation.]

(;B[of]C[vernon: Probably a mistake, but I was afraid of losing R15 or letting R16 live. See variation.

C[$ don t save the stone. It will become a weak attacked group. use the dead stone to build thickness]

(;B[oi];W[mh];B[ll]C[vernon: Miscalculation. P12 should keep running to P10, IMHO.]

$ i agree];W[nj]
(;B[bi]C[vernon: Psychologically, this was probably a bad move. I wanted to guarantee that this group was alive, but as the subsequent moves show, B loses a lot of territory. See variation for a possible better path, attack first, then secure.

$ very odd indeed to play inside a large influence like this. I don t feel this group in immediate danger.]

(;W[aq];B[ap];W[ar]
(;B[lr]C[vernon: I consider this a very strong move. Not only does it make territory on the bottom, but it denies W eye space, which later kills P4.

$ big mistake, black can get a nice ko in corner]
(;W[hn]C[$ strange every body seems to forget left botom corner.]
;B[in];W[hm];B[im];W[hk];B[fk];W[gl];B[fl];W[fm];B[dk]C[vernon: B keeps sente as he makes the connection to F9.]
;W[cl];B[ol]TR[pn][op]C[vernon: B's goal was to provide connection between O9 and M8 in sente. But he starts the attack that captures P4 by accident.

$ the keima can be cut]
(;W[ql]C[vernon: I felt that this was too weak. I was expecting Q8. Contact in defense.]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[po]C[vernon: B now realizes he can split W. This gains B many points, and because of the reverse komi, wins the game in the end.]
;W[on]C[vernon: W sees it too, and tries to prevent it.];B[oo]
;W[no];B[nn];W[nm]
(;B[mo]C[vernon: This is perhaps the wrong move. B wanted to keep the connection betwen M2 and M6 as well as capture P4. This move keeps the O4 cut as well as protecting the gap at M5.]
;W[mn];B[np];W[nn]
(;B[ml]C[vernon: Perhaps a bad move. B wants to keep both M8 connected to M6 and M8 to O9. But he loses P8.]

(;W[ig]C[vernon: If W fails to play here, B will capture G14. See variation.

$ yes but the capture of 2 stones allow white to reduce black. I m  not sure this is the best choice]
;B[hd];W[sq];B[ro]C[vernon: Mistake. B should play at S3. This wastes time and loses a stone. This would have been a good move before the monkey jump.]
;W[so];B[sr];W[qo];B[pp]C[vernon: I chose not to lose P4 to a ko fight.]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[ok]C[vernon: Those two stones are finally worth more than other moves.
