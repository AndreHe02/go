C[Hi!

Thank you for your review and that you take time to give me some new ideas on Go :)
I appreciate that very much.

*X*: Hi, my name is Alex.  I'm a Canadian 3 dan.  I'll be putting *X* (X for "Xopods," my KGS username) before my comments to distinguish them from yours.  I hope I can be of help.]
;B[dp]C[I played White but if black made any big mistakes please dont hesitate to point them out.]
;W[pd];B[dd];W[pq];B[dj];W[fc];B[hc];W[fe]C[*X*: When reviewing a game, around this stage of the fuseki I usually get on gobase.org and do a pattern search, so I can see how common the moves are and give examples from pro games.

However, even this early, at move 8, there are zero occurences of this pattern in professional play.  I thought F15 was a little sketchy, but I was a bit surprised that it had never been tried.

So, I went back a move, and it turns out that there are only 5 occurences of F17 in this fuseki.  In all 5, Black pincered at H17 and White invaded at C17.

What this should tell you is that F17 is dubious (a search for F3 instead of F17 turns up many results) and that F15 is just plain bad.

I think the reason that F3 is better than F17 is that after Black pincers and White invades the corner, the adjacent side (top side here, bottom side if White approached F3) becomes unimportant.  That is not a big deal for White's komoku in the lower right, because it wants to develop up the right side anyway.  However, White's hoshi wants to develop on both the top and the right, so making the top side uninteresting hinders its options.

The reason F15 is bad is easier to pin down.  After Black D14, the usual move would be J16 for White, pressing Black down and building thickness.  However, since this thickness faces a low stone (Q3), it's harder to use effectively than if there was a hoshi in the lower right.  Furthermore, White will be forcing Black to crawl along the top side, which again damages the potential of White's top right hoshi.]
;B[df];W[id]C[Is it ok to play this joseki here?
Later in the fuseki i feeled that the overall position was not favourable for White but perhaps i am just too pessimistic.
It would be nice if you could show some other possible josekis to play here.

*X*: There isn't really any other option.  I suppose you could try jumping again, to F13, then after B D12, counter-pincer around K16.  You see this once in a while in amateur play.  However, White can't really feel good about giving Black that much fourth line territory.

Anyway, I already explained why this doesn't turn out so well for White.  Better would have been to play F15 at C17 instead, and better still would have been to play F17 at F3.]
;B[ic];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[hd];W[he];B[lc];W[me];B[jp];W[mc]
C[Is this the right move to punish black's tenuki?

*X*: Well, you can't really punish, exactly, since tenuki wasn't necessarily wrong.  However, K4 was the wrong place for him to play his tenuki.  The right side is clearly the biggest area of the board.

Locally, I think this is okay.  O17 seems like better shape, but maybe it isn't severe enough.  Black can forego protecting his weakness and play G16 instead.]
;B[mb];W[nc];B[kc]
(;W[nb]C[*X*: I don't think this is big enough.  Seems like you're forcing Black to exploit your weakness at G16.  Maybe you should defend G15 instead?]

(;B[ma]C[*X*: This is ridiculous.  Black should play G16.];W[gb]
;B[hb]
(;W[po]C[To be honest I had no idea how to use the strength i built in the upper part of the board.
Q5 looked to me like the only move here.

*X*: You don't have any strength.  You have influence, but it's thin.  However, one move at G15 would be enough to make you thick.  I think that's the only move.]
;B[qj];W[ql]C[right direction?

*X*: Yeah, having made the high shimari, you have to defend its open skirt.]
;B[qg];W[lq]C[*X*: Seems too small and slow to me.  You have to stop Black from developing a large moyo in the lower left.]
;B[kq];W[lp];B[jn]C[*X*: You're definitely losing now.]
(;W[cq]C[Is this the right timing for the 3-3 invasion?

*X*: Seems to make Black too solid.  I'd try to reduce from above first.  Or maybe a different invasion.  See variations.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[dr];B[er];W[cr]
;B[fq]C[Something I wanted to know since I made my first 3-3 invasion: Is the marked move (black F3) really necessary at this stage of the game (in general and here especially with the stones at k4 etc). And how can White punish it the best if black doesnt play F3 but tenukis?

*X*: It's not 100% necessary, but without it, Black is not thick, so White will be able to reduce more easily, and has extra endgame profit with the clamp at F2.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[pg];B[qh]C[I expectated black to play q12. But this way the two white stones at the outside look a bit weak...
Is it right that I stayed away now? (I saw no Sente move for White to threaten the black stones which I handled as strong)

*X*: Yeah, tenuki is good here.  G10 would be my move.  See variation.]

(;W[ik]C[*X*: This is kind of the right idea, but it isn't as severe at G10 because it doesn't aim at D12.]
;B[db]C[*X*: This is too small.  Play F12 or something now.]

(;W[ge]C[It hurted much that Black got this nicely Sente move D18 but I think I had no other move than connect at G15.

*X*: Wrong.  Now that Black has defended both the corner and his top side group, what are F17 and G18 doing?  Absolutely nothing.  Well, threatening seki, maybe, but that's it.  Black G16, White G15, Black F16 is less than 15 points gote.  F12, by contrast, takes control of the whole middle.]
;B[kk]C[*X*: Too deep.];W[kl]C[*X*: Good.];B[jl];W[jk];B[il]

(;W[hl]C[*X*: Too aggressive.  Just stretch... you're taking enough profit in the centre to win.  See variation.]
;B[hk];W[ji];B[hj];W[ii]C[*X*: This is 20 or 30 points worse than the variation I showed.  Big mistake, eh?]
;B[pf]
(;W[gl]C[After I played this move I feeled that it was exaggerated and that it was a thank-you-move.
Instead of this move, should (and could) White invade Black's moyo at the left/top and where would be the best starting point?

*X*: Yeah, this only helps Black.  Instead, if you played F12, you'd be threatening both D12 and F10.  See variation.]
;B[fj]
(;W[io]C[Overplay?

*X*: Probably.  You don't need to peep here to force at L7, so if that was your plan, you should have just played L7 directly.  If you didn't have a plan, well... there's your problem.]
;B[jo];W[km];B[in];W[of];B[pe];W[oe];B[qd];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc]
;B[re];W[qf]C[Aji Keshi?

*X*: Yeah.  If there was a move to be made, it would be S14.  That would require T17, though.]
;B[qe];W[sd];B[rf];W[na];B[lb];W[ce];B[cd]C[*X*: This is a terrible move.  Black should not even think about it - D15 is the only answer.]
;W[de];B[cf]
(;W[ee];B[be]C[Was here more possible for White?

*X*: I feel like there should be something better, but I don't see it.  Still, you've reduced Black in sente and created some aji.  See variations for some possibilities.]

(;W[bm];B[bl];W[ei];B[ej]
(;W[eg]C[*X*: Peep at B13 first, maybe?];B[gh];W[bg]C[*X*: Okay, so B lets you do it anyway.]
;B[bf];W[ef];B[dh];W[kr];B[jr];W[dg];B[cg];W[ok]C[*X*: Good move.]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh];W[nh];B[ph]
(;W[og]C[Later I realized that this move was too small (I guess I was afraid of the many cutting points). There are some bigger moves at the bottom. Could you show me where you would play?

*X*: You're right that it's too small right now, but it isn't tiny.  It's 7 points reverse sente.  S9 is bigger.  E12 is also a fairly large sente move.  The biggest move, however, is L4, since it prevents M5 and has a large follow-up.]

(;B[qn]C[Isnt this invasion too deep? Black could simply reduce Whites moyo by attaching at M5.

*X*: Yeah, M5 first is better.];W[rm];B[pn]C[*X*: Play at M6.  Black can't live here.]

(;W[qo];B[lo]
(;W[kp]C[*X*: Bad.  Black isn't going to answer this now, which is why you should have played it earlier.  No choice now but to N5.]

If you're going to fight the ko, you're comitting yourself to answering any threat bigger than what it would have cost you to back down.  The difference between winning the ko and backing down (as in the variation you showed) is 5 points.  Therefore, if you decide to fight the ko, you can only ignore threats worth 4 points or less.  This threat is nearly 15 points.  Essentially, you threw 10 points away for nothing.]

I'm looking forward to assimilate your review :)
Thanks

*X*: This wasn't a very good game to send to the GTL, because you know why you lost.  The blunder at P9 cost you 16 points or so and the ko threat you ignored cost you 10 (compared to backing down), so you should have won by 25 points.  To get the most out of your GTL reviews, you should choose games that you lost on strategic grounds, not on silly blunders late in the game.

Overall, you played better than your opponent, and clearly know how to use your influence to make a moyo.  Now all you have to do is slow down, read things out at least three or four moves in advance at *EVERY* move to avoid silly blunders, and count the score before playing recklessly.]
