C[hiead [14k\](me) vs. buzzsaw [7k\]

buzzsaw played a friendly teaching game with me (so don't be concerned that I'm 7kyu weaker and taking white in an even game, heh), and gave a brief review at the end. If there is anything you can add, comments you can make, or questions you can answer, I'll greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

Tim: Ok, I'll take that into consideration. I'm only 6k myself, which isn't stronger than your opponent. Hopefully, I can still help.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp]
(;W[dp]C[Tim: You don't always have to take the other corner. Sometimes it is advantageous for white to approach before taking the corner to avoid fighting a black shape that you don't want to fight. This move is not wrong by any means, but there are other options]
;B[oc]
(;W[kp]C[Is this extending too far?

I'm more accustomed to seeing a play on the K line than the L line here. I wouldn't really consider this an extension. It's really more of a distant approach toward Q4 than it is an extension.  

But I don't think this is the main concern here. I think this part of the board isn't ideal. Whenever the opponent makes a shimari from a 3-4 such as the upper right, you almost certainly want to prevent the big extension to the 10 line such as R10 or Q10. That play is huge for white. And like the proverb says, "My opponent's good move is my good move." Indeed I would certainly play R10 here]
;B[qj]C[Black does not miss the opportunity to capitalize on white's mistake.]
;W[di]C[Again, perhaps I should have just nailed the star point?

Yes, the star point here would give you a san ren sei, but its not crucial or anything. I might play F3 to help your D4 stone work together with L4]
;B[fc];W[fe]C[This isn't a move that I usually play, but it is joseki when you have a stone at D11 like you do. (The stone could also be at C10 or D10 for that matter) So your choice is good here. The followup goes a bit awry though.]
;B[db]C[This slide is very common. You almost always want to answer this with the 3-3 or else your opponent will! C17 is the move here.]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[cc]C[And you end up with an empty triangle as a result. And your corner suffers from inefficiency.]
;B[ic]C[Except for the empty triangle, I like your result here. I think you got more than black did from that exchange. It's still a bit open, but it looks good at the moment.]

(;W[qn]C[R10 can be played to pincer a move like r6. So you should look at this stone as being played where there is already a pincer. It is a very tight space. I like the ogeima (long knight's move at O3 a little better.]
;B[nq]
(;W[no]C[O5 is floating. It's pretty far from both of your stones, and it's nowhere near the edge. It is however near black's strength. My instinct is to snag the corner while its open. I like s4 here.]
;B[qp];W[pn];B[cn]C[I would tenuki here. The low approach to your 4-4 isn't life-threatening. A second kakari is nothing you can't handle. I would play the capping stone at P10.]

(;W[dl]C[I like this high pincer. It is consistent with your other high stones (Which is all of them :-)]
;B[cq]C[I]
(;W[cp]C[I would block the other direction. The rule of thumb for which way to block a 3-3 is to run the opponent toward your nearest stones. D8 is closer than L4 meaning that the wall that results will be best suited facing L4 and overconcentrated facing D8.]
;B[dq];W[eq]C[This hane is a mistake when black has the C6 stone. It is ok otherwise.]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co]
(;B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq]C[Black fails to see his opportunity.]
;B[ge];W[ff];B[gf];W[gg];B[hg];W[gh];B[hh];W[hi]
(;B[ii]C[This drifting kind of shape always makes me feel uneasy. I don't know whether it's good or bad, so I was wondering what your thoughts on it are.

Yes. You're right to feal uneasy. There is something I started saying to myself when my opponent and I are both running in the same direction. If you both think you are getting a good result from this sort of exchange, one of you is probably wrong. The test is to ask yourself what you are getting out of this right now.  

While you are making a large amount of territory, it was fairly secure several moves ago and didnt need this extra thickness staring back at your earlier stones. Black's shape was low and this running is creating a solid (and sizeable) moyo.]
;W[pe];B[ne];W[ph];B[oj];W[qi]C[It's important to evaluate what you are getting out of this fight. Can you really save this group? If you can, will it be worth it considering how much strength black will gain facing your would be moyo?]

C[Is this a worthwhile cut, or was it nonsensical?

There are things to gain with this move.];B[op];W[np];B[or]

(;W[pq]C[There is a working ladder here for black, this running doesn't do anything.]
;B[qq];W[mq];B[nr];W[mr];B[pr]C[Which you do anyways. You didn't lose anything by playing it (except ko threats for later). Not a big deal.]

(;W[ng]SQ[fg][gi][hj][on][ep]C[Thoughts on this extension? I also was considering both O12 and O11 at the time, but decided on this.

If you're going to play a move from that goup (which isn't a given) O11 is probably the most interesting in my opinion. It puts considerable pressure on the black group here, but it's life really isn't at stake.

It would be better to take care of the aji around J11. Black is able to jump in so deep because he can escape your framework with contact moves and ataris on weak cutting points. 

I indicated some areas that black might use. 

Just for fun, I'll try O11.];B[jn];W[jo];B[in]C[Black is being a bit greedy here in my opinion.]

;B[gn]C[Giving away a ponnuki here is definitely bad. It gives black a connection where none should have been created.]
;W[eo];B[fn];W[bn]C[In retrospect, this move seems wasted. That black stone probably won't live anyways, right?

Probably not.];B[hp];W[jq]
