AB[pd][dp]C[I am "judicata" on KGS, and just reached 2k. Whenever you see a comment such as "this is bad" or "this is good," pretend as if I said "in my opinion" or something similar. I don't want to sound over-confident, but adding qualifiers to all of my comments would be tedious and distracting. All comments are mine unless preceeded by "//" (which are siowy's questions).

It is reviewed with black in mind, but I have a few comments on white.

This was an enjoyable game to review--there are plenty of interesting moves and positions for study.  Usually, games with a big point disparity aren't great for reviews, but this game is an exception--black put up a good fight and was actually slightly ahead until a devastating mistake near the end. Aside from that mistake, it was a close game with both players putting up a good fight.

I've added quite a few comments and variations, but I suggest you focus on the parts I've flagged as with "***Key Point***." Here are some general thoughts:

(1) Don't get tunnel vision. Remember to step back and look at the whole board before making a move. It is easy to get focused on a local fight and not realize you're putting one of your own groups in danger.

(2) Avoid creating weak groups...especially near other weak groups. This is the easiest way to lose a game quickly.

(3) Look for the better move after finding the obvious one.  Perfect examples are at moves 28 and 34.

(4) If neither you nor your opponent have a group that is in danger of dying, make sure to consider the big points.  An example of this is at move 14 (and several moves after that).

(5) Usually the point of attacking is not to kill (although you're happy to oblige if your opponent plays elsewhere), but to benefit from the attack.  See the variation around move 22 for an example.]
;W[pq];B[dd];W[dj];B[qo]C[Good.  There's no need to respond to D10 right now, although it is possible.]
;W[qp]C[This "kick," whether played after an approach to a 4-4 or 3-4 stone, is usually not good unless White can attack the R5 stone. Usually, this means there must be white stones around R9 or so.]
;B[po]C[Good response.];W[mq]LB[np:A][op:C][nq:B]C[This isn't correct.  White should normally play at A here.  Sometimes, B or C may be played.  For example, White B might be better if there is a black stone around L3. Black can extend from Q5 (more on that in a minute) and leave the aji.  But I would probably play P3 immediately--see variation.]
(;B[pl]LB[pk:A][qk:B]SQ[po][qo]C[This is too slow--Black should play at A or B*.  There is a proverb something like "If one, two. If two, three."  Like all proverbs, there are exceptions. But generally if you have one stone (usually on the third line), you should extend two spaces to make a base.  If you have two stones (like the squared stones here), you should jump 3 spaces.  

*Here is a more advanced tip (even though I'm only a kyu myself), but disregard this comment and focus on getting the basic principle down. I think Q10 is possible here because black has the sente sequence at P3, making the marked stones even stronger.  After playing the sequence at P3, the three-space extension is a bit overconcentrated.]
;W[cf];B[gc];W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb]LB[cl:C][cm:A][cn:B][oq:D]
C[//Should I respond here now?

I think you know :).  This is too slow.  You might want to respond if you can attack the D14 group afterward, but it is safe for now.  My move choices are marked. A, B, and C prevent white from making a bigger formation on the left side, and leave the possibility of securing the corner later.  Some stronger players might prefer C, but A and B are simpler, avoid complications, and reduce white's potential significantly.]
;W[eg]C[Slow for white.  As white, I would play C6 without much thought.]
;B[ge]LB[cl:C][cm:B][cn:A]C[//Not sure about this move

(;B[kc]C[//How was this move?

I like the idea--take away White's eye space and prepare to attack.  But maybe it is better to chase white out while building a moyo on the right?  See variation.]

C[Often these kinds of moves are good, but I think this is better for white.  I still like N15 better.]

This is too passive--try the double hane.  See variation.];W[mf]
;B[ie]C[At first, my instinct was to call this peep a bad move. But on second thought, it is fine--it inhibits white's eye shape, prepares to cut off white, and is sente. Just remember to consider whether a peep helps your opponent more than it helps you. But I think this one is fine.]
;W[je];B[nf]C[Good.];W[ne]
(;B[nd]C[***Key Point****

Nooo.  This may be the most important point in this review.  Black is strong in this area and has no worries.  In this situation, we tend to think of the atari first, which is fine. But also consider moves like P14 or O13.  I think O13 is best.  See variation.]
;W[ng];B[of];W[og];B[pg]C[Maybe Q14 is better here.];W[pf];B[oe]

Sure.  It is possible to push the marked group around-it is currently eyeless.  But I still am itching to play A, B or even  C.  D is also good because it will help black's group in the lower right, which is looking a bit weak.  Finally, E is another idea--it puts some pressure on the marked group and helps black's lower right.]

See next comment.];B[kh]LB[bm:B][cn:A]C[***Key Point***

//How was this move?

What was your goal with this move? If it is to attack white, this isn't severe--white can live easily (note that white has G18).  Maybe after playing something like O9 later, black can launch a better attack.  If this move was meant to reduce, it is way, way, way too early.  White has fewer than 10 points in the center, and there are many bigger moves.

Depending on how you respond, this move could (and actually did) cause quite a bit of trouble.  I'm not convinced white even has to respond.

K4 is still hanging out there, and is a really big move. A and B are other ideas.  And there's still P3.  See comments after this fight.]

;W[mh];B[lg];W[mg];B[mi];W[ni];B[mj]C[//Should I have captured to remove the aji instead?

Maybe, but I don't think black should play the atari--just get that group out of there and connected.]
;W[ok];B[oj]LB[mm:A]C[***Key Point***

Here black gets splintered into two (and later 3) weak groups. This is a turning point in the game.  Black is ahead. The most important thing for black is to connect these groups so white doesn't have a good target.  'A' instead of P10 seems to link black's groups.]
;W[nj];B[nk]LB[mk:A][qk:B]TR[lg][kh][lh][ki][mi][kj][mj][kk]
C[//On hindsight, this move and the previous move seems too greedy to me, and my groups are now quite weak. What should I have done?

It's good that you recognize you have two weak groups, which leaves you at a disadvantage.  Playing P10 at N7 (as noted earlier) would have avoided this, I think.  But even assuming neither group was weak, what is the marked group doing?  If you thought you could kill white, then your initial idea may have been ok, but looks difficult.  Don't pick a fight that won't likely benefit you.

Also, notice the double atari at A, and the bad aji at B.];W[ol]
;B[nl];W[om];B[mm]TR[mj][kk][nl]SQ[rk][pl][po]C[//Is this bad shape?

Between this and O7, I like O7 better because it reduces white's liberties.  But this situation is getting bad.  It's difficult to find a good move.  Black needs to settle the group marked with squares, and needs to link up the triangle-marked group (living is okay too).]
;W[nm];B[ml];W[no];B[rp];W[rq];B[pp];W[qq];B[op]LB[qk:A]C[Black should be making the two groups here safe...this doesn't do much for either of them. You really have to watch out for white A. If white plays 'A' now, I think black might be able to fight his way out. See variation.]
(;W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[mo]LB[pm:A]C[***Key Point***

I would be itching to play this cut too, but it is a terrible idea and creates yet a THIRD weak group in the lower right part of the board.  Black A fixes some bad aji and settles the lower right group.]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[ln];B[ko];W[kn];B[ll]C[Here you notice how weak the group is. Maybe this was necessary, but this seems like a losing path for black.  I think I'd choose K4.]

;B[on];W[nn];B[bs];W[lj];B[cr]C[***Key Point***

Two important points.  First, white's threat is valid. It turns out black escaped in the game, but white should have killed the entire L9 group.

Second, and just as important, black can kill white outright with A1 instead of C2.  Sure, if white takes with B2, black can connect and white is still dead, but there's no reason to give white a free ko threat.]

This is a result of black having weak groups for white to attack.  This goes all the way back to L12 and P10.  This reduction move is ok, but I've marked some other moves I like better (in no particular order, though A is my favorite).  Note, I like C (F11) better than F12 because white doesn't have as easy a response.  D and E are big not because they reduce, but because white at G18 is big and sente.

I'd hate to play F, because it is gote, but that ko is really bad for black.]
