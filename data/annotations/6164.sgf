C[Hi, I was Renacer in this game, is a quiet one, so i expect coments focused in the first 20-30 moves.

Thx for the coments, and excuse my bad english.

[kb\]: Hi, this is Kyle Blocher, 2-dan from the USA.  I will do my best.  My comments are marked with [kb\].

Your fuseki plan was very good, but you left obvious weaknesses and did not continue with your plan in the middlegame.  White did not play the best towards the end but still was ahead by too much for Black to win.

Focus on playing good shape moves and the key juncture (focal) points to improve your game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qo];W[dd];B[qj]TR[qo]C[Here Im testing some new; the idea is use the marked stones for great force, and expec an early invation. R10 for take advantage in the most known joseki when white play at Q3. ¿is good plan?

[kb\]: This is a fine plan, though R10 should be at R11 to make the most of any play at Q3.]

(;W[qq]C[im not sure about the next moves, i think that not work to me, please show me better

[kb\]: Your play was fine, except for the slow move at S5.  I have included the joseki for reference.

Your opponent walked right into your plan, though.  Playing 3-3 here hurts his 4-4 stone on the left side - your pressing moves remove the potential of it.  Black is certainly better with the game result.

White can think about this way -];B[pq];W[pr];B[oq]
(;W[or]C[[kb\]: Normally White pushes first at R4, but the shape is best to continue on the left side.  Your play at O3 is fine - White is crawling on the 2nd line, the "line of defeat" - each play there gains him 1 point of territory, but gives you at least 4-5 points of influence.]
;B[nq];W[qp];B[po];W[nr]
(;B[ro]C[slow?

[kb\]: Yes.  You should jump to M3, staying in front of White.

S5 is small for both sides.];W[mq];B[mp]
(;W[lq]C[[kb\]: White may think about the double hane -];B[lp]
;W[kp]
(;B[pp]C[[kb\]: This is almost a useless move.  Do not let your opponent push up at L5, whatever the cost!

You may even think about the cut -];W[ko]C[[kb\]: With this move, White takes the lead.  This play is at least 20 points]
;B[cn]
(;W[co]C[[kb\]: This White play is bad.  Normally we attach at C5 to attack the Black stone, but there is no White stone around D10 to help with the attack.

The two-space high pincer looks good here -];B[dn]C[I played this way to over concentrate white, is fine?

[kb\]: D6 is the only response.];W[fq]C[[kb\]: White is showing he is a very territory-oriented player.  Keep playing to develop your moyo.

Unfortunately, it is difficult for Black to recover after White L5.]

(;B[cj]C[[kb\]: Risking bad comments from fellow players of my level, you may think about C11 instead -

Remember, you have F5 in reserve.  If White ignores F5, you have lots of options with the corner.]
;W[ch];B[fc]
(;W[fd]C[[kb\]: White will be overconcentrated after this move, it is not so good.  White may simply defend corner territory with D17 -]
;B[gd];W[fe]
(;B[ec]C[[kb\]: You should jump, to take more of the corner -]
;W[dc];B[df]C[[kb\]: A trick play]
(;W[de];B[ge];W[ef];B[dh]C[[kb\]: White has been tricked.]
(;W[dg]C[[kb\]: First play hane -];B[eg];W[cf];B[di];W[hc];B[jc]
C[[kb\]: Connecting is safer and better. This leaves White too much aji to play with.]

(;W[nc]C[[kb\]: White should cut.];B[ne];W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[Better r16? im afraid of the invations around R13, that way i played this

[kb\]: R16 is much better, especially considering the problems on the top left part of the board -]
;W[qd]
(;B[pe]C[[kb\]: With the O15 stone in place, you may hane -]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]TR[qj][po][qo][ro]C[You should only expect around 10-12 points from this formation now.  It is seriously weakened by the White formation at the top.]
;B[qe]C[aji keshi?

[kb\]: Yes, you have destroyed good moves at Q12 and P13.];W[re]
;B[pf];W[qg]LB[qe:1][re:2][pf:3][qg:4]C[[kb\]: These moves have only fixed White's shape and gained Black very little.]
;B[ld]C[[kb\]: If you are going to fix something here, how about connecting at G17?]
;W[gc]C[[kb\]: White is clearly in the lead now. There are no good follow-ups to repair Black's shape here.]
;B[hd]TR[gd][ge]C[[kb\]: This is definitely not the best way to defend.  Let me illustrate a couple of ways for White to exploit the empty triangle here -]

(;W[ic];B[id];W[jb];B[kc];W[kb]C[What is the biggest here? why?]
;B[lb];W[fb]C[[kb\]: At least White must come back to defend in gote, so now you have the opportunity to consolidate your moyo.]
;B[oh]C[[kb\]: Good direction, but gote.  This is why the earlier exchanges are bad!

It also leaves a hole - simply defending at P11 would be better.]
;W[fg]C[[kb\]: Very, very painful for Black];B[lm]C[[kb\]: if Black's stone were at P11, then this would be quite good -]

(;W[pi];B[ph];W[qi];B[qh];W[rh]C[i missed the tesuji... but i not sure about R11 running around my potencial moyo

[kb\]: Yes, this is very bad.]
(;B[oj];W[rj];B[qk];W[rk];B[gh]C[[kb\]: This move leaves very bad aji -]

(;W[jm];B[kl];W[jl];B[jk];W[gm]C[[kb\]: White should just keep pushing, making the aji around G14 worse]
;B[fn];W[go];B[do];W[cp];B[gn];W[hn];B[fo];W[gp];B[ik]C[[kb\]: J9 is very large]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[lo];B[mo];W[nn];B[oo];W[ql];B[pl];W[pk];B[pj]
;W[no];B[np];W[qm];B[pm];W[gl];B[kq]C[i felt some tesuji here, but i didnt can read it, please help me.

[kb\]: After Black's pushing moves around the bottom left corner, I don't think there is anything here.  Maybe earlier...

You should save all these moves for ko threats.

The rest of the game is yose, just one more comment on the White group on the right at the very end.]
