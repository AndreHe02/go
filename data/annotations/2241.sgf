AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[First large handicap game, I felt a little restrained at first. I wasn't sure which stones were important and which I could loose, I was given the handicap stones.

The score at the end, is not correct, I must have saved the sgf too soon. I give the final stones? at the end. If I missed any they were questionable.

Olof: This is the first review I write, I hope it's good enough.]
;W[nc];B[fc];W[pg];B[md];W[lc];B[ld]TR[nd]C[was m16 nessecary? The next few plays seem week to me.

Olof: It's not a bad move but I think O16 would have been better. Puts more pressure on Q13 and strengthens the cornerstone.]
;W[mc];B[od];W[nd]C[I think I should have played o15 here

Olof: Yes that is the correct move.];B[kd];W[ne];B[nf];W[mf]
;B[me];W[oe];B[pe];W[qc]LB[pc:A][pf:B]C[I know I could of handled the 3-3 invasion better, buy building thickness

Olof: This is NOT an invasion, it's an attack on your 3 stones in the corner, the only way for you to live here is to run for freedom, Q14 is a nice tesuji that uses the aji at O14, white has a few different answers but you will most likely live.
See variation for one possible outcome.]
(;B[pc];W[pb];B[qb]C[maybe instead of r18 I should have played r17 or even q15? What would of been best here?

Olof: Q14 is still the only thing that works. You can't confine him in the corner and live at the same time.]
;W[rb];B[pa];W[qa];B[ob];W[oa];B[dg];W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[gc]
;W[id];B[he];W[ic];B[jc]TR[ie]C[Olof: This is the mistake that sets up the white wall. Should be play at J15. This is also sente as white has to play K17 or he will loose his 3 stones on the top. 

This gives white territory at the top but the black thickness and influence in the center more then makes up for it, and it's sente for black.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[if];B[hg]C[How coulld I avoiided this?];W[ig]
TR[ih]C[Olof: I think now is time to play the hane at J12, you might possibly wait one more hand so that the stone at tengen strengthens you.]
;B[hh];W[ih];B[hi];W[ii];B[ij];W[hj];B[hk];W[gj];B[gk];W[fj]
;B[fk];W[ei];B[ej]C[Olof: This is a very good sequence for black. Perfect play.]
;W[mp];B[mq]TR[jm][pn][lo][np]SQ[ik]C[Olof: This is bad, it's a mistake often made beginners, you can't play directly below the fourth line invasion, now white can choose what side to hane on and attack. 

Then how to respond instead? Well now we most look at the whole board. The joseki answer is Q6 but you have a stone at K4 make a fighting move like O4 possible. But we are still not considering the whole board because N4 is not only an invasion it's also a ladderbreaker for the cut at J9. So moves like M5 and K7 has to be considered. I can't tell you which one is the best, it depends a lot on what you want to do.]
;W[ik];B[jk];W[il];B[jl];W[im];B[fi]TR[jm]C[Olof: It looks too slow to me, if white connects at F11 you can play a move around F8 to stop him from cutting you. K7 is one good move here, keeping the pressure on the white stones and building thickness one the right.]
;W[jm];B[hl]TR[km][gn]C[Olof: Here is one of the worst moves you made in the game. It does nothing at all. If you want to stop him from pushing left then G6 is ok, but the best move here is the hane at L7. This will keep the pressure on the white group.]
;W[lk]C[I think I should have play whites move instead of h8]
;B[gq]TR[pm][np]C[Olof: This is ok, but I think O4 and Q7 are bigger.]
;W[hm];B[qm]C[I think I was too defensive here, should I have pushe more towards the center?

Olof: It's ok. You are so far ahead that you can afford to be a little defensive.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mr];W[rp];B[ro]
;W[rq];B[ms]TR[ns]SQ[qo]C[Olof: This is not an interesting move. White doesn't have to answer it. If you want to play a hand extra in that area then it's O1 you should play. But tenuki is best here (white has a cut at R5 but the R7 stone confines it so it's not that big (good endgame move).]
;W[pr]TR[jc][jd][kd][ld][md][me][km]SQ[lk][mp]C[These
last few moves built up some thickness and kept white inside, how could I've
better used that thickness

Olof: The thickness should be used to attack the stones at N4 and M9 and save the group at the center top. The hane at L7 is a good start to see how white responds.]
;B[qh];W[qg];B[rg];W[rf];B[rh];W[ph];B[pi];W[ni];B[nj];W[mj]
TR[nk]C[Olof: Up to here it's not bad (but not the best way to use the thickness) but starting with hand 90 you make several big mistakes. 90 should be at O9 (check the attach and extend joseki for this often occurring shape).]
;B[oj];W[nk];B[pl]TR[ml][om]C[Olof: One more mistake, too slow. If you want to play safe then P7, is ok. The best move is at N8 but you have to play correctly in the follow-up or you could be worse of.]
;W[nm];B[om]TR[ll][cm][lm][fn][lp][cq]C[Olof: The mistakes keep coming, this sequence (including the next few moves) feels a little rushed from your side. You just play the first move that comes into your head, responding to his plays without thinking.

M4 is one good move here, a probe at M7 or M8 can be fun. You should also consider tenuki (C3, C7, F6 are moves that all look good) as there are very few points left to fight for in area around O7.]
;W[on];B[nl];W[ml];B[ok];W[ol];B[pn];W[pm];B[po];W[fm];B[em]
TR[dm]C[Olof: Almost the same mistake as hand 94, then you attack or defend you should not play in contact if you don't have several stones to back you up because white will play the hane.

D7 looks very good here, it will stop white from penetrating further and strengthen the left side (it's still possible to invade there).]
;W[el];B[ek]TR[dm]SQ[gi]C[Olof: Here comes the go old proverb into action: "Then cut, extend". D7 is very good here. The cut at E9 is nothing you have to worry about as you can always play G11 then needed.]
;W[en]TR[dm]C[Olof: Again extend, D7];B[dl];W[dm];B[cm]TR[cn]
C[Olof: This is overplay. To many cuttingpoints, play something like D6 instead to protect the corner.]
;W[cn];B[co];W[cl];B[bm];W[dk];B[ck];W[dl];B[bl];W[cj];B[bk]
;W[bj];B[ci]TR[ch]C[Olof: Good so far but this move is a big mistake. Again, then you attack and defend don't play contact moves, D12 stops white from extending further along the side.]
;W[bi];B[bh];W[ch];B[cg];W[di];B[eh];W[bg];B[dh];W[ah];B[ci]
;W[di];B[ei]TR[bf][bn]C[Olof: This move is the second totally useless move you make in the game, there are only two moves to consider here. B6 and B14. I think B6 is bigger but I'm not sure.]
;W[bf];B[be]TR[bd]C[Olof: And again, the you defend you don't play contact moves. B16.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[ce];B[cd];W[bd]TR[bc]C[Olof: The cut at D15 isn't important, E15 easily defends against it. B17 is the only move.]
;B[de];W[bc];B[cc];W[cb];B[db];W[ca];B[da];W[ba];B[ak]TR[bn]
C[Olof: And here comes another really bad move. I'm not sure what you are trying to do with it. The white can't be attacked he already got 2 eyes. B6 to save the black group.]
;W[bn];B[an];W[bo];B[bp];W[am];B[ap];W[ao];B[eo];W[fp];B[fq]
;W[ep];B[fo];W[gp];B[go]TR[eq]C[Olof: Good so far but it's time to stop running and defend. E3]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[er];B[dr];W[hp];B[ho];W[hq];B[jb];W[ib];B[ia]
;W[ha];B[ga];W[ja];B[gb]TR[re][lp][jr]C[Olof: Yes this move is worth a few points but there are several a lot bigger points to play. K2, M4, S15 etc.

We are now moving into the endgame. Here it's importent to keep sente, always play the sente moves first even if they are worth just 2-4 points.]
;W[jq];B[om];W[nl];B[pm]C[Olof: 1 point gote, the worst move there is in endgame.]

;W[mg];B[kf];W[kb]C[Olof: Nicely played here, you saved the large black group at the top. I'm not sure that even I could have done that.]
;B[ki];W[kk];B[kj];W[lq];B[so];W[cq];B[cr];W[lr];B[es]C[I
 let white build too much thickness of my wall, between that and the stone
at o8 I lost a huge portion of territory

Olof: Sure, both were big but not game deciding. What decided the game were the white invasions on the left side and in the bottom. This were black territory but ended up mostly white. At hand 103 you were still ahead at least 30-40 points.]
;W[fs];B[ds];W[ls];B[hb];W[ia];W[dn];B[do];W[fn];B[bq];W[oo]
;W[np];B[sp]C[RikiTiki [15k\]: i know these look trivial to you]
;W[sq]TR[kl]C[RikiTiki [15k\]: but the end game can acoount for lots of points
cospof [27k?\]:  are you just filling in questionable spots?

Olof: There are as much as 10 points still to be gained for black at this point. They are not just questionable spots, Black L8 for examples are worth 5 points in gote or 3 points in sente.]
;B[ip];W[jo];B[iq];W[ir];C[RikiTiki [15k\]: well no there is one more point left that i see]

Olof: Here the game ends, W+63.5. BUT there are a cool trickplay left for black. L4. If white answers wrong (and it's likely he will) black will gain 45 points. See variation.

You started out good, a few misstakes here and there but nothing too important. By hand 100 you were in a big lead but then you lost it to bad defence.

Your understanding of infulence and thickness is good but you lack in the attack and defend area. This is what you should practice. Most importantly defence. Try watching a few 15-10kyu games and see how they defend. Also practice at endgame, preferably with someone stronger that can show you the point difference in various moves.

I think you are better then 27 kyu. 23 kyu maybe.

;B[kp]TR[kq]SQ[hr]C[Olof: Here white must play H2 or he dies, this is a little hard to see, he will most likely play L3.]
