C[Hello,  This is a game I've played one month ago. although i've won i'm not satisfied because i think there are some errors i can not point out (especially some moves that could be larger.
I added comments to the moves i recognized as mistakes after reviewing it today (05.11.02)

thank you

Hi,

I will precede my comments with G4. My nick is also go4fun. Thanks in advance for letting me review your game.

After reviewing your game, I must say that you are playing very strong. But often you let white off the hook. You had several possibilities to kill white.  You played some good moves, gaining strength. If you had gained strength, you should use it to attack. Try to read out, if the groups on the board are living. If it is one of your own protect it first. If it is one of your opponent, try to gain territory while attacking. But if your opponent switches to another part of the board, you should try to punish him.

At last have fun with your upcoming games.

Peter Hoehe];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[cp];B[nc]C[G4 When playing at the star point, someone doesn't want to make territory, but influence. So it is better to play a big move. If you want to play a shimari, P3 or P4 are best.]
;W[oq];B[pq]C[Wrong direction ?
G4 You strengthen white. He will get an ideal extension, but it is not necessariliy a bad move.]
;W[qn]C[G4 That is an overplay. If black plays P4 now, white has gained nothing.]
;B[ro]C[G4 White has 2 lonely stones. Black is strong in the corner. So don't let white connect his stones. I think P4 is best.]
;W[rn];B[po]C[might be better at P4
G4 :-)];W[qk]C[G4 From 2 stone wall extend with a 3 space jump.]
;B[qi]C[G4 Good];W[qe]C[G4 Another overplay];B[qd]C[G4 Good]
;W[pe];B[oi]C[G4 Very good. Now white has 3 weak groups. This is a disaster for him.]
;W[ne];B[lc]C[too small
G4 This is small, but this is very good. White cannot make a base for his group, so it remains weak. If black denies to play there white may play N17.]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[qh];B[ep]C[G4 If you cannot get a good result by attacking, play elsewhere. This is a good move. You could also consider playing bP14, wP15, bP12 first.]
;W[fq]C[G4 ?];B[eq];W[gp];B[op]C[G4 Th 2 black stones are very lonely. They must be helped. Black should play D5 or E6, oe if he is willing to fight he can try C5.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[mq];B[ok]C[G4 This is a good strategy. First gaining strength, then attack. But is black sure, that he can rescue the 2 stones on the left? If not this looks like a good exchange for white.]
;W[pn]C[G4 heavy];B[on]C[G4 Don't attach what you are attacking. Better to play O6. I think white is dead then.]
;W[om]
(;B[nn]C[G4 Black is STRONG here. So black has to fight.  Play O7. Se the variation.]
;W[nm];B[le];W[mn];B[mo];W[ln];B[lo];W[pl]C[G4 This protects against black playing there. But what about the 5 stones above?]
;B[kq]C[G4 or this 3?];W[lq]C[G4 That doesn't work.];B[kp];W[pr]
;B[qr];W[os];B[lr];W[mr];B[ls]C[G4 This is a mistake. Just play L2 (solid) and white is dead.]
;W[ms];B[kr];W[nr];B[ps]C[G4 ?];W[qs];B[rs];W[ps];B[rq];W[gn]
;B[en];W[jn];B[ce]C[G4 If you look onto the board, you can see 3 weak groups, the 5 white stones in the upper right. the 4 blacks on the right and the one white stone in the lower left.
Black should consider playing there. This is important. I would prefer M12.]
;W[cm];B[ch]C[G4 Black can only play this way if he is sure of life of the 3 stones.]
;W[cj];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[df];W[ef];B[dg];W[gd];B[ic]
C[G4 I think you both are missing the important part of the board. The 3 lonely black stones need help, and the 5 white stones in the upper right need help.]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[hc];B[ie];W[hf];B[if];W[hg];B[ei];W[ek];B[fl]
;W[fk];B[gl];W[fi];B[hj]C[G4 Black is not connected yet. A knights move can be cut. The cut at F7, E7 is dangerous.]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[hl];B[hm];W[il];B[im];W[jl];B[jm];W[km]C[G4 Black got a difficult position now.]
;B[in];W[jo];B[io];W[ip];B[jp];W[hp]C[G4 But seems to by lucky.]
;B[ko]C[G4 Uargh. L6 catches the 2 white stones, and connects at least 5 black stones.]
;W[kn];B[kl]C[G4 But this is of course much better.];W[kk];B[ll]
;W[mm];B[jk];W[fo];B[eo];W[ir];B[fp]C[G4 Not necessary. Killing white is bigger. Taking the base with F2 is substantial.]
;W[fr];B[fn]C[G4 Much too small. At least E2.];W[er];B[gm]C[G4 Black is connected. Not necessary to play another move there.]
;W[js]C[G4 ?];B[fh];W[gi];B[gh];W[hi];B[hh];W[ej];B[di];W[dj]
;B[ci]C[G4 This are a very small moves. The 5 white stones in the upper right are very weak. And the Q8 group is not alive yet.]
;W[ii];B[ih];W[ji];B[kj];W[lk];B[mk];W[ki]C[G4 ?];B[lj];W[rj]
;B[ri];W[mg];B[lg]C[M12 ?
G4 I think it's too late now, but M12 is slightly better.];W[lh]

(;B[kg]C[or now th cut at N12
G4 yes. Black is strong, so he can try that of course.];W[nh]

))
(;B[nm];W[nn];B[oo];W[nl];B[ol];W[mm];B[pm];W[pl]C[G4 This ends in a Ko. A Ko is very good for black.]
;B[qm];W[rm];B[nm];W[mc];B[om]C[G4 Black can also protect. But I think the strength he gaines is more worth than the position on the upper side.]
