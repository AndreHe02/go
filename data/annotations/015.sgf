;B[cc]L[fq][nc]C[jl: b c17 is probably too early. f3 might have been better.


TS: Actually, I'm not sure; the played move might be perfectly ok. If Black plays 'a', White might play 'b', which isn't bad for Black of course, I just dislike mana (mirror) go. A race to the center point would seem to follow.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[fc]L[ed][bd]C[TS: Another option is 'b', although it's hard to say if it's better -- the game changes considerably. See variation B.]

(;W[ed];B[gb];W[db]L[fd][fa][gc]C[TS: White should first play 'a'. If 'b', 'c' is just about sente. If, on the other hand, Black answers 'a' at 'c', then White can play d18 and 'c' becomes a superfluous stone.]
;B[fa];W[cb];B[ge]L[fd]C[TS: 'a' is the vital point, I believe.];W[hc]
;B[gc];W[nc];B[ob]L[oc][pc][ne][pf]C[TS: One usually plays this move only when Black has a strong position on the right. It might be ok here (though I doubt it), but personally I'd settle for 'd'.


White's next move, 'a', feels like aji-keshi (potential reducing). Cutting a cross with 'b', or playing 'c' threatening the same, seems better. See variation B for an example.]

(;W[oc];B[pc];W[nf];B[pf];W[hb];B[ff]L[hd]C[TS: 'a' seems like the vital point, after which Black seems to pretty easily settle himself.]

[jc][hf]M[bc][cc][dc]C[jl: b b14 is not good, I misread here (thought that b16 worked after b14).


TS: More importantly, even if it _did_ work (by which I assume JL means that the marked stones escape), it wouldn't be a good idea. Black would then have two weak groups on the board, and White only one - which can easily escape.


One reasonable option would be 'a'.. If 'b', then 'c', 'd', and 'e', after which Black looks pretty safe.]
;W[cf];B[cg]C[TS: Black is just increasing his loss here.];W[df];B[bd];W
[be];B[ae];W[ce];B[af]C[jl: disastrous. I keep giving more prisonners :-(]
;W[ad]L[eg][dg]C[TS: Pointless. White should just play 'b', isolating Black's center group.

In case you're worried about Black capturing White's stones in the corner, don't be. See variation B, for example.]

(;B[eg]L[ie]C[jl: b e13 was played to ensure a minimum of safety for my group and take sente elsewhere.

TS: Minimum of safety here isn't a good idea. I recommend 'a'.];W[dg];B
[po]C[jl: I thought I had to maintain the balance of territory and let the weak group look after itself. Of course I was expecting the following W attack.


TS: The main problem here is that by attacking the Black group, White gains actual territory *and* power. This power can then be used to invade Black's moyo.]
;W[gg];B[eh]L[ie]C[TS: 'a' still looks the most effective way to develop eye shape and/or escape.]
;W[gf]L[ie]C[TS: But now 'a' leads nowhere.];B[fe];W[dh];B[ej];W[ek]
L[fg][ef][ei]C[TS: The sequence White 'a', Black 'b', White 'c', looks nastier.]

[ei];B[cq]L[ji]C[jl: b c3 would probably have been better at c4.


TS: I don't know about that, but abandoning that group doesn't appeal to me. I'd play 'a' or thereabouts.]
;W[cp]L[fi][gh][ih][dq][mp]C[TS: Continuing the harassment of the large group looks like a better idea. For example, 'a' is absolute sente, besides which it eliminates any aji Black has here. When Black connects, 'c' is a nice follow-up move, and is also sente.


Furthermore, an interesting alternative would be 'd', gain sente, then invade at 'e' or thereabouts. A double-attack might be in the offing.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er]L[fq][fr]C[TS: White next played 'a', but pressing uncompromisingly at 'b' might be better. See variation B.]

(;W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[fi];B[gh];W[co]L[cn][ih][ao]
C[TS: I'm afraid I can't condone this. The standard move at 'a' is better, one reason being that the hane at 'c' is now sente.

Besides, I still feel White should play 'b' first. It eliminates weaknesses there and is sente.]
;B[nb]C[TS: Black is toying with fire. This is not the main focus of the game.]
;W[mc]L[ih]C[TS; Equally frivolous. 'a', and by attacking the group White should be able to sequre his moyos and reduce Black's.]
;B[bh]C[jl: b b12 played under strong time pressure to gain some time.


TS: Unfortunately, as demonstrated earlier, this does nothing. White should tenuki.]
;W[bi];B[ik]C[TS: White now loses lots of momentum in this game. I think I'd still take White, if I'd have to choose, but Black now has hope.]
;W[il];B[jk];W[jl];B[ie];W[je];B[id];W[jc];B[jf]L[ih]M[mc]C[TS: A stone at 'a' would now be very useful for White.

The momentum that White lost after playing the marked stone is now becoming very evident.]
;W[jg]L[kf][qi]M[gg][gf][if]C[TS: White's best policy now might be to sacrifice the marked stones with 'a', then invade at, say, 'b'.]

(;B[ib]L[ld][ja]C[jl: I should have played b m16 before j18.

TS: 'a' certainly produces complications, however, White can live with 'b'.

jl: I don't think that W can live, go back to see a variation.];W[ic];B

[rl]C[TS: Black loses his last opportunity to kill the group. The continuation after Black 'a' can get quite convoluted, but White can't get two eyes after that. The key is to wedge in at s9 after White plays 'b'.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[si];B[qj];W[pj];B[ok];W[qk]C[TS: White has at least 6 local ko threats, so him winning it looks like a foregone conclusion.
Should the white group live, White seems to have a slight territorial lead.]

(;B[ld];W[ja];B[lc];W[lb];B[kc];W[kb];B[ic];W[ib];B[ha]L[ij][lh]C[jl: although B has the cut at 'a' to worry about, I think that B should be able to kill the top W group, because W also has the cut 'b' to worry about.]
))
(;W[fr];B[bp]M[fr]L[fq]C[TS: If 'a', White's moyo becomes more sequre than if he'd played the marked stone there.]
;W[bo];B[co];W[ep];B[bn];W[bq];B[ao];W[br];B[cl]L[fi][gh][mp]C[TS: Next, White 'a', Black 'b' is to be expected, after which White can again invade at 'c'.

(;W[dg];B[bh]L[ad][bg][ab][ch]C[TS: If Black 'a' instead, White 'b' cooks Black's goose, or if Black 'c' or 'd', White 'a'. Black 'b' is similar to this variation.]
;W[ad];B[ac];W[ab];B[ad];W[ag];B[bg];W[ci]C[TS: Black clearly loses the race.

<end of variation>]))
(;W[pc]N[Cutting across];B[oc]L[qc][od]C[TS: Black may also answer at 'a', the proper answer to which is 'b'.]
;W[od];B[oe]L[nd]C[TS: 'a' instead produces the most complications, but in all of them White breaks into the right side. The curious readers should explore these possibilities on their own.]
;W[nd];B[qc]L[qd][pb]C[TS: If 'a', 'b' captures.];W[pe];B[qd];W[of]
C[TS: White has just about settled himself, Black is almost shut in the corner, and his moyo looks much more vulnerable than before.
In short, good for White. :-)

<end of variation>]))
(;B[bd];W[be];B[ce];W[ed]L[bc]M[ed]C[TS: Just to state the obvious, cutting at 'a' is out of the question: Black cuts at the marked stone and gets a ponnuki.]
;B[bf];W[bc];B[ae];W[bb];B[ch]L[cg][nc]C[TS: Essential, lest White can harass the black stones with 'a'.
Next, White 'b' seems likely, so his moyo shifts from the left to the top.
