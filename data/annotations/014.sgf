;B[pk];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb]L[qc][me][jp]C[In my  opinion, black can play
a, b, or c in this situation.
<a>: simple joseki. shows black's patience.
<b>: presses upper white group and builds moyo on right side.  Changho Lee  played here in Tongyang Cup title game against Rin.  However, it was after  black had played Q5.  So playing 'b' right now is a bit early.
<c>:  pretends to builds moyo.  If white plays at D10 or C10, black can play  at Q5.   However, in most cases, white plays at Q5 (or less preferably at  R6).  If white plays at Q5, it is difficult for black to capture that stone,  but black expects to get some profit at bottom side, and to play F3 if black  gets sente.
Overall, I prefer "c" (your play) to "a" or "b".];B[jp];W[po];B[np];W[qq]
;B[qr];W[pp];B[oq];W[pl]L[ok][qk]C[Next, black can play either "a" or "b".  I  prefer "a" as it is better than "b" to attack white group, and most  importantly, has better chance to get sente. "b" is solid move in the sense  that it secures black territory on right side more easily, but that territory  is not that big, and a bit concentrated after white plays R17.]

(;B[qk];W[ol];B[ql]C[P9 is better than R8. Whilte P9 is sente (as black should play  Q11), and moves toward center (black cannot attack white group any more).]
;W[ok];B[pi];W[cj];B[ro];W[on];B[mn];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni];B[fp]L[fq]C["a" is  more popular than F4 here.  F4 is not bad, though, as black bottom right is  pretty solid.  F4 is a step toward center, and a bit aggressive.  "a" is more  conservative (keeps territory), but can slide toward corner (D2) later.   So, I think both F4 and "a" are good here, but if I were black, I might play  at !
"a".];W[cn];B[fn];W[qc];B[mk]L[fc][fd][qd]C[jloup: b
 n9 was not very good. f17 probably better.

I agree with you.  If N9 was a sente, black can play "a" or "b"  or R16  (very defensive one).  But I doubt that black N9 can get sente.  If black  N9 is not a sente, black should have played upper side, which is biggest now.   Further, N9 doesn't much expand black bottom territory (or moyo).  If I  were white, I would play O12, and after black P13, at "a"  or K17.]
;W[nh];B[og];W[ml];B[ll];W[mm];B[lm];W[mo];B[nn]C[jloup: b o6 shoud  have been at o5.

Yes!!. Absolutely O5.  White cannot play at M6 after black O5 because black  O8 will capture white two stones.  Black bottom bottom left group is quite  secure because black has R4.  White N5 was an overplay (to me), and if  black played O5 here, the best moves for white would be O6.  After black M6,  white can tenuki at F17 or K17.]
;W[no];B[lo];W[nm];B[lp];W[ln];B[kn]C[White gained a lot thanks to black mistake.  Now, white group is almost  secure, and black bottom is a bit reduced.]
;W[jc]L[cc][fd][df]C[Now, white  got sente without much weakening left group. Now white conrols the game  (Upto this point, I think white is better).  Now, it's time for black to  invade or reduce white influence.  I can think of such moves as "a" through  "c".
<a>: generally speaking, invading 33 when white has two wings (K17 and C10)  is not good, as it allows white to have outward wall (and territory), and  maybe sente.
<b> and <c>: these moves reduce white territory to one side.  I would prefer  "c" to "b" as it is closer to nearby black stones (bottom).   Suppose black played at "c" and white responded at "b".  Black can  just jump  to F14, or play at D12, or invade at C8.]
;B[cc];W[dc]C[White chose upper  side.  I think this is correct decision.  If white gets a wall (while  allowing black to live in the corner with 5-6 points), N15 or N14 will  complete big white territory at upper side, as well as connecting left group  and upper group.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc];B[fj]C[The sequence in the upper left corner is pretty standard.   Fortunately, black got sente, and played F10, which I think is a good (and  urgent) move.  F9 may be an alternative (a conservative one), as F10  induces white at F8.]
;W[fl];B[kd]L[je][id][fg]C[jloup: I also considered playing a, b or c. Any  of these was problably better than L16.
ychoi: I think L16 is not bad.  Playing at "a" or "c" is good to me, too.   "b" can be a little dangerous.  There are two important points here.  One is  somewhere around N14.  Another is G8 (for black) or H8 (for white) or  somewhere like that.  White cannot take both places right now, but can take  them while attacking black.  "b" is farther from other black stones than L16,  "a" and "c".  It means, it is more profittable, but is more dangerous at the  same time :).  (I tend to play a bit conservative, so you may diagree with  me).  If I were black, I would play L16 and expect white K16, black L14.]
;W[kc]C[White L17 is a definsive move. It allows black to  press white (at M16 or K16; I prefer M16), which in turn enables black to  attack white left group (that group is pretty much safe, but not completely  settled yet).
The reason I prefer M16 is that, M16 gives me a miai at M17 or J15 (if white  takes one, black takes the other).]
;B[jd];W[id];B[jf];W[jh]C[White K12 is  for multi-purposes, but not very effective.  White wants to separate two  black groups (one at F10, another at L16), to attack one of them, and to  advance white left group to right.  Unfortunately for white, surrounding  black groups makes it easy for both L16 and F10 stones to escape.]
;B[kg];W[mf];B[kh];W[ki];B[ie]C[Black J15 is a good move (sente, makes eye shape,  reduces white moyo, tries to connect F10)]
;W[hd];B[ji];W[jj];B[ii];W[kj];B[lj];W[li];B[gf]L[re][eq]C[By playing at G14, black is ready to live inside  white moyo.  Time to do a rough count.  White has about 25 points at upper  side, another 25 on left side; total 50. (plus two captured stones)  Black  has about 20 on right, 25 at bottom, and 5 at center (my count is not much  reliable though :) .  Black still need to catch up komi difference.   However, there!
 are some big points left here ("
a" and "b" come to my mind).  White has sente, which is a big factor in  middle game. Still white leads.]
;W[il]L[km]C[White J8 is questionable.  It is not  effective to attack black center group (which is alive already).  It cannot  cut at "a" (because black has N6).  And, even if black plays J8, it doesn't  help black add much territory.  J8 is almost dame. I think white misread  something here (maybe he thought he could cut at "a").  Now, black got  sente.]
;B[qd]L[re][rf]C[Black R16 is big.  Being compared to white "a"  (or even "b"), black got about 8-10 points here.  Black almost cought up  white. But white still has sente.]
;W[ho];B[eq];W[dq]C[Black took another big  point (E3).  It was a little risky, as white could play at H3 or J4.  White  responded at D3 (another defensive move), and secured corner.]
;B[hm]L[hp][hq]C[Black H7 is very aggresive :)  If black is more defensive, "a" or  "b" will connect two groups, and white will connect H5 (a peaceful  resolution :) !
 Now, after black played at H7, wh
ite G3 would give black some headache. (look at variationB; it's probable  that i am misreading here. But in my opinion, white could get some profit  here).]

(;W[hp]C[White still could play  at G3 instead of H4.];B[go];W[er];B[fr]
;W[ep];B[fq]C[White three stones are  dead. However, there still remains an aji (at H2), after all outside  liberties are filled.  Also, if white gets E2, black should fill out  liberties to take out three white stones (This is not a big problem in GOE  rule)]
;W[en];B[ek];W[dl];B[ij];W[hl];B[ld]L[qp]C[jloup: I also considered a (r4)  which was very big. I'm still not sure that b r4 would have been better  because m16 ended up destroying a good part of the upper side.

I like M16 better.  M17 and next move (M17) can reduce white territory by  about 12 points.  "a" is big, too (I would say 10+ points).  However, a  plus for M16 and M17 is that black can threathen white upper right corner.]
;W[qp];B[lc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[lb];W[ib];B[bh]L[rr][eg][dr]C[jloup: b b12 was  very bad, it should have been at b13.

Yes. B12 too greedy, and costs sente.  Even B13 is not urgent at this moment  (becuase white B13 is not sente for w). Black could play "a",  "b" or "c"  instead of B12 or B13.]

[sn];W[qm];B[rl];W[gh];B[fh];W[fg];B[gi];W[gg];B[hf]C[jloup: b h14 was a  terrible mistake made as a result of strong time pressure.

Yes. A big mistake.  Should be H12 or J12.];W[ih];B[nd]C[jloup: one of the  two b groups was likely to die, so I decided to save the bigger one.

IMHO, the bigger one is pretty much alive already (i.e. even if white plays  first, it's hard to kill this group). It has one eye at K15, a gote eye at  J14 (black can play at H13, and after white H12, play J13 to get an eye),  and black can play either at O16 (to connect) or at O18 (to make an eye).   Anyway, O16 is a good move by itself (good yose).  On the other hand, the  small one is pretty much dead already (i.e. even if black plays first, it's  hard to be alive :).]
;W[oc];B[di];W[ci];B[eg];W[ff];B[ei];W[od]L[dj]C[jloup: w p16 should have been at a (d10) to kill the other group.

I guess white thought black small group was alive or he could black big  group.  As you said, white could kill small group by playing "a".  On the  other hand, black big group is still flexible (still H13, O18, O15 exist).]
;B[ig]C[J13 is a sente. But, now black cannot make an eye at J14 (after  white H12)]
;W[hh];B[dj];W[hi];B[hj];W[gk];B[gj];W[fk]C[White F9 a small  mistake. As black group is already alive, white should play at D9, and use  sente somewhere else (maybe at N16)]
;B[dk];W[ck]L[ne][nb]C[Black managed to live  both groups (as black has sente). Black can play at "a" (to connect) or  at "b" (to make an eye).  If black plays at "a" white stone will come at  P15, which make possible for white to play at S14 (as it turned out to be).  Thus, I would prefer "b". (look at variations B)]

(;B[ne];W[oe];B[nf];W[rf];B[se];W[of]C[White P14 is not good. White could just R15,  without exchange of P14 an O13.  Or, white can O13, and after black P14, play  at R15.]
;B[ng];W[pe];B[qf];W[qe];B[rg]L[mg][dr][ge][mb][ai]C[Game was deci
ded here (after white captured (Q16 and R16 stones).
Now, let's count it (roughly) again. White has 25 points on left side, 12  at upper left, 11 at upper  right corner, 3 at right to bottom (total 51+  captured 2 + 8 komi = 61). Black has 8 points at upper left corner, 5 at  center to upper 2 groups, 17 at right side, and 31 at bottom (total 53  points).  If black played O18 instead of O15, the score must be whit 57 and  black 58 with white having sente.  In either case, white has advantage, but  the difference is bigger now as black allowed white to capture Q16 and R16  stones.  Now, white has sente, and he may want to play at "a" through "e".]
;W[gm];B[gn];W[dr];B[rp];W[rq];B[mg]
(;W[fs]L[hr]C[jloup:  I was afraid w would play at a (h2) instead.

Right. As white got D2, he could play at "a", which would force black to fill  out all liberties while while take all outside dames (point in GOErule).  Look at variation B. (note that white 3 stones are still dead).]
;B[gs];W[es];B[hr];W[mp];B[mq];W[op];B[fe]C[I would play at G15 instead.  White could cut at G15.]

;W[ee];B[ah];W[pj];B[qj];W[oj];B[aj]C[A10 is not a good  move. Should be the last move. (if you have played everything else, you play  at A10, white A9, black A14, white A11 and it's a tiny ko).]
;W[ak];B[pg]C[jloup: I was under such a time pressure that I could not read the situation  here and preferred adding a move instead of losing on time if w cut.

I am sure that you now see there is no cut here (as S14 is dead).  R11 and  Q12 are miai (if white cut one of them, you play the other).]
;W[fm];B[rs];W[mn];B[nb]C[jloup: another terrible mistake made because of  time pressure.

Yes, again, it's an obvious mistake.
Black lost about 8 points here. As no points are left on board, and white is  leading by 15+ points, the game is decided by now.]

;W[em];B[mh];W[jg];B[mi];W[mj];B[lh]L[ob]C[I think this is also due to time pressure. M12 is an one point  reverse gote. "a" absolute sente 2.5 points (reduce white territory by 2  points, and black can make one points later if b plays first). Should play  here first.]
;W[jk];B[eo];W[do];B[fo];W[af];B[ae];W[ai]L[ac][af]C[jloup: I  played a (a17) because I did not have time to read the situation but I  could simply connect at b (see variation B).

Yes :).  You may want to remember this shape. A15, B15, B16, C16, C17, C18,  D18 is an alive shape.  B16, C16, C17, C18, D18 is a ko shape (when all  outside liberties are filled).  Definitely "b" here.]

(;B[ac];W[af];B[ag]C[White got another 7 points here. Now the difference is 20+ points (black  lost 15+ points due to time pressure in yose moves).]
;W[ah];B[sd];W[sc];B[sf];W[ob];B[ka];W[ja];B[la];W[na];B[ma]L[ea]C[Just a tiny mistake.  Black has  exclusive right to play at N19 anytime, but it's a half gote (white can  ignore).  "a" is the only point left now.]
;W[oa];B[he]C[jloup: my yose  is awful, but when you have only a few seconds left...

I understand :)];W[hg];B[if]C[jloup: b j14 is the final blunder. With only  one minute left, I had to reply instantly to
any move because of the netlag.];W[kf];B[je];W[le]C[jloup: I was about to  resign but lost on time instead... But w would have won even without the  obvious b blunders in the end.

It didn't matter though :)  Black lost anyway.  Both black and white made  mistakes in this game (as all go players do :). Except the last blunder, I  can think of several tactical mistakes by black (O6, B12, H14, O15, O18,  K17).  All of them gave white chances to get extra points or time to play  tenuki. This kind of things happen everytime in most of go games (yes,  including mine), so I wouldn't say they decided the game.  They were offset  somehow by white  mistakes :). O6 was, however, a bit more serious than the  other ones. Besides psychological impact (obvious mistake in early phase of  game), it gave away to white a chance to play at upper side (K17), and  thereafter, white controlled the game. If black played there first, it should  be much easier game for black. In terms of fuseki, I felt a little  uncomfortable with F4 and N9, and most importantly (to me), early defensive  moves (R9 and R8) which enabled white to escape without much trouble, and  to tenuki at!
 other places. So, I would blame R
9, R8, and O6 as bad moves.  I think both black and white should have played  better if there was no netlag (I know netlag spoils games a lot).  Even  with such a netlag, you (and white) played very well except some obvious  mistakes.

Good luck to your next game !!])
