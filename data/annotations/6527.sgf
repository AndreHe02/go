AB[pd][dp][pp]C[amnesia (black): please can the reviewer indcate where black can cope with white's style without having to read out lengthy semeai's?

and what do you say about black's strategy, which was to give white what he wanted (ie let white pick off bits here and there) whilst building solid positions?

the strategy didnt work - black lost, more or less by the sum of the bits picked off.

when i succedded in making a seki on the left, i thought i had won.  but i hadn't! help!!]
;W[ee]C[Hi! I'm putting my conclusions at the start, rather than at the end.

First of all, re-reading this review, it sounds very negative. Don't worry, you played very well indeed, with very few serious mistakes. It was an interesting game to review.

Secondly, it's a bit detailed. Normally I try to focus reviews on one or two points, but this is the first time I've reviewed for a strong SDK, so I've just added everything I could think of. I hope you don't mind!

Overall, you lost because you didn't fight hard enough. Like you say, you lost by the sum of white's small gains. You should work on appreciating the value of weak and strong groups: not just ones that might die immediately, but long-term strength that affects strategy rather than tactics. 

I hope this is useful. If you have any questions or anything, find me on KGS (I play as "sixsix"). Enjoy!]
;B[cj]C[This is good direction, killing the influence of E15, but almost any move is good this early.]
;W[nq]C[I've put variations for black's next move here. They are all just ideas, most of which you probably considered yourself.]

(;B[cf]TR[ch]C[This three-space extension leaves a weakness at the marked point (C12), and you should really have a plan for dealing with this. See the variations uses of the three-space extension.]

(;W[cd]SQ[ch]C[This is a good move by w; now you have no good move to fix C12. When you play a three-space extension (or any other shape), you should be aware of its weakness and have a plan for dealing with it.]
;B[ec]SQ[ch]C[too deep?

Definitely. You seem scared of letting w have any points at all, but you are just giving him targets to attack. You now have two worries in the top left, and still haven't answered O3, while w has only one group to worry about in the top left.]
;W[fc]C[There are a couple of variations on the next two b moves, just for interest.]

(;B[fd];W[ed]
(;B[bd]LB[bd:!]C[You are abandoning the fight! If w plays D17 now, he is guaranteed a good result]

(;W[bc];B[cc]C[This is the only move in the game that is an outright mistake. I assume it was just a silly misread.]
;W[dc];B[be];W[cb];B[gc];W[eb]C[white looks really overconcentrated.  black feels happy.  would you be happy if you were black?

Definitely not. White is certainly inefficient, but that has to be compared to black's position: two stones captured, two on the second line, and a further two stuck uselessly to white's unkillable group, with the C12 invasion point still not fixed.

Most importantly, though, w has a strong group out into the center. The best use for handicap stones (and influence in general) is for attack, and that means keeping your opponent cut, weak, and sealed in. There's a variation earlier in which b gives w a big, sealed-in corner, which is worth comparing with this position. Bear in mind that we not even twenty moves in, so investing for the future is an important idea.]
;B[nc]LB[eg:A][lq:B]C[Good direction again. A (E13) and B (M3) are also good.]
;W[pn];B[oo];W[qq]
(;B[ql]C[yes, it's not joseki, but is it fair, given the black position in the top right?

Not really. See the variation on this move.];W[qp]C[Last chance to save the honour of Q4 stones by cutting at Q3]
;B[qi];W[pq]SQ[oo][pp]C[R11 is good, but the Q4 stones are now useless so you have effectively lost two moves.More importantly, you still haven't given w any weak groups.

White has two very strong positions. Black's positions, while impressive-looking, are full of holes and weaknesses.

In particular, you say you were trying to give white what he wants while building strong positions. Maybe this is what you were thinking of, in which case you need to reconsider the relative strength of R8 and R11. A two-space extension is strong enough in the opening, but they are only two stones, and later in the game they will be very thin. On the other hand, white's corner will never ever be weak. Therefore w certainly comes off better here.]
;B[lq]C[too close?

A little, yes, but it's justifiable because it aims at P2];W[on]
C[This is not a good move by w. Those two stones are useless, so attacking them is a waste of time.]
;B[mo];W[mp];B[lp];W[no]C[White is far too intent on taking two stones.]

(;B[nr]C[yose move, right?

Yes, O6 to seal w in is better];W[or];B[mq];W[np]
(;B[eq]C[Not bad, but I would also consider N6];W[jq]C[Far too deep. W is aiming at attacking the M3 group, because he knows an attack is more powerful than a straight invasion, but b can handle this]

(;B[hq]C[Dubious. Deciding whether to pincer or cap is often hard, but here K5 is definitely better. See variation]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[hp];B[gq]C[maybe J2 better?

W's last two moves are played to prevent b connecting underneath with K2 so the attack on M3 can continue. This move is good, J2 only gives w more forcing moves.]
;W[ko]C[Now it's clear that b should have played K5 instead of a pincer]
;B[jp]C[Good!]
(;W[kp]
(;B[kq]C[k2 better?

K2 leads to trouble - see variation. Your move is better.];W[ip]
;B[jr];W[jo];B[lo]C[Well played - b has no weak groups and w still lacks definite eyes, floating in b's moyo.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[ir]C[white wants a ko...black doesnt want trouble, so...?

...so black just gives in and lets white have exactly what he wants? You have to fight this ko, it's huge and also hugely favourable for black. Black takes first and also has a nice ko threat at O6 - what it there to be afraid of?]

(;B[nl];W[kr];B[lr];W[js];B[mm]C[ok?

No! Terrible! :D

You have to appreciate how important it is to keep your opponent weak and yourself strong. Now white can use H4 as support for a strong invasion of the left side, which is looking rather thin. Furthermore, black's link to the right side has all sorts of weaknesses which white can exploit later in the game. Compare this with the position where b fought the ko.]
;W[pj]C[how to handle this?

In the fight that follows, you tend to play in the wrong direction, missing chances to make your stones work together. It's always worth bearing in mind the two iron rules of fighting:

- Connect your stones (and cut your opponent)
- Move out to the center (and seal in your opponent)

I've given lots of variations to look at, bearing these in mind. Hopefully they'll give you idea to think about.]

;W[km];B[jk];W[do];B[co]C[b4 better?

No, this is good.];W[dn]
(;B[dm]C[This feels very bad indeed. You are pushing white through your territory, gaining very little. Players of all levels make this mistake, in varying degrees of subtlety. The most obvious example is watching beginners, who try to block invasions by playing contact moves; their opponent just pushes right past. It's sometimes called "squeezing out toothpaste".

Here, you cannot connect underneath w, so pick one side and deal with it properly.]

(;W[ik];B[jm];W[ln];B[mn];W[gl]C[nice combo by white, which black hadnt seen coming.  suggestion?

- Backing down from the (extremely favourable) ko let w settle himself and create a weak b group which is now causing trouble. 
- R10 instead of Q8 was the wrong direction, letting w use the strength of his corner and cut the centre group.
- Letting white turn at N10 was huge and changed the whole feel of the game, with w controlling the centre.
- E7 was just not effective.
- D7 and C7 were very bad style.
- Black has missed his chance to cut at K10 and coutnerattack.

These mistakes, none of them too bad, all come together to leave b in this position. Black escapes very nicely, but it costs a lot of points on the left.]

the wite stones in the middle arent connected to the side yet, but how can black exploit their aji?

Notice that the C12 weakness created right at the start has made a difference! White also has D14 tesuji to capture even more stones.]
