;W[jd];B[de]L[ce]M[jd]C[Rob- I feel that  c15 (a), would be better here, since the lower move doesn't allow w to  utilize the marked stone as effectively.]
;W[dg];B[fe]L[cc]C[Rob- c17 (a) looks better here. This move forces w to make  territory on top, which is what he wants anyway.]
;W[fd]L[gd][fc]C[Rob- A mistake by w. w should not play contact here, since he is attacking.  I feel that g16 (a), or f17 (b) are both superior.]
;B[fg]C[Rob- This is a solid move.];W[di];B[fi]L[cc][jj][lc]C[Rob- I  don't like this as much. I feel like this forces w to make territory on the  left, while b is still thin, and hasn't made any points. Again (sorry to be  repetitive), but I like c17(a) if I'm going to make a move locally. I might  move to k10 (b), or m17 (c)...]
;W[dl];B[mc]M[pj]L[ld][lc]C[Rob- A very nice move. Attacking while making points. I might have  considered m16 (a) or m17 (b), but n17 might be better.  m16 (a) is a little  less solid, but it is the high move, which works well with the marked stone  in moyo building. However, it doesn't attack w's k16 stone as well...]
;W[hp]L[gd]C[Rob- A big move, but wrong, I think.  w must respond on top, in my opinion. g16 (a) would have been better for w.]
;B[gd]C[Rob- Absolutely right.  Very nice.];W[fc];B[gc];W[ce]
(;B[ed]C[Rob- I feel that c14 (a), is a  superior move here. It gets b a break-in to the side, and keeps w split  (although both halves will probably live. See the variation..]
;W[dd];B[df];W[cf];B[ie]L[jj][qg][cp]M[jd]C[Rob- This move feels too slow. It  does come close to killing the marked stone, but I feel it is too small a  scale. I would recommend k10 (a), as the best move here. Other options might  be r13 (b), or c4 (c)...k10 (a) looks really good to me though..

Right now though, I feel b is ahead, because of w's h4 mistake..];W[qf]

(;B[qh]L[qe][pf]C[Rob- I'm not sure  what move is right here. I would probably do r15 (a). Then if w does q14 (b),  you do r12..See the variation..]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[Rob- I might have done q17 (a) here..Getting facing thickness is quite  valuable..See the variation..]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[rc]L[re]C[Rob - Thi s isn't necessary. Just s15  (a) is fine..]
;W[rb];B[re];W[sc];B[qe]C[Rob -  Still a great result for b..];W[mp];B[no]
M[jp]C[Rob- I'd say this  is not right.. I feel that either k6 (a), k10 (b), or q6 (c) are good.  k6  (a) would probably be my choice..o5 is going to force w to make moves which  weaken the marked stone. I don't think there is any reason for b to weaken or  kill off the marked stone.]
;W[mo];B[np];W[jn]C[Rob- This feels too soon, too greedy for w..I would either n6 (a),  or maybe l4 (b)..I can see the attraction of this move though.]
;B[mq];W[lq];B[mr];W[kq];B[mn];W[ln];B[lm]C[Rob- Strong moves by black. Taking advantage of some poor shape by  w..]
;W[mm];B[nn]
(;W[kn]L[km]M[mo][mp]C[ Rob- As w, I would do l7  (a), and say 'take the 2 stones, I'll take a ponnuki in the center'. It seems  more valuable than those 2 stones..See the variation..

After working through the variations, I'm wrong. :) It seems that if w allows  b to kill the marked stones, then the l3-n3 stones die too. That's too large.  But b is getting very valuable thickness here, and it's clear w made an  error. Perhaps at k6?]
;B[km];W[jm];B[ml]L[kk]C[Rob- This seems wrong. My move would be l9 (a)..]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[io]C[Rob- Seems no  chance for b to escape, if w plays reasonably..]
;W[hn];B[ho];W[go];B[gp];W[gq];B[fp];W[hq];B[lp];W[lo];B[kp];W[jq];B[cq]
L[cp]C[Rob- There  is aji here, but c4 (a) is the right move. When w does c4 now, b is dead..]
;W[cp];B[eq];W[dr];B[iq];W[ir];B[lj];W[lk];B[mk];W[kj];B[li];W[fk];B[eo]
;W[fn];B[gm];W[gn];B[gk]L[ki][ec]C[Rob- This seems a bit dubious. l11 (a) is a HUGE move, as is e17  (b)..]
;W[gj];B[hj];W[hk];B[ik];W[gl];B[gi];W[ij];B[hi];W[ii];B[ih];W[ki]C[Rob- Very large..]
;B[kh];W[qq]C[Rob -  Here is the game..If w can live, he wins, I think..The aji at o3 might allow  w to live..]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[lr]C[Rob- This seems to be  a mistake. w should p3 (a), and then that is a living shape..]
;W[oq]C[Rob - This should live..];B[ip];W[jr];B[nq];W[op];B[oo];W[rp];B
[ro];W[sq]L[rq][rr]C[Rob- No.  Just s3 (a), and w is alive..Now s2 (b) is a killer..]
;B[rr]C[Rob- Very good.];W[rq]
(;B[pr]L[ps]C[Rob - Hmm..Perhaps  p2 lives?   After looking ahead, it seems p2 might get a seki. I think q1 (a) for black  removes that aji. It is a monkey jump, and seems to leave s2 at the key point  of a bulky 5 for w, a nice dead shape.. :) See the variation..]

(;W[qr]C[Rob- Well, this definitely doesn't work. Lets try p2, see the  variation..

Rob- Seems p2 gets seki for w..];B[or];W[rs];B[sr];W[qo];B[po];W[qn]C[Rob- This does nothing for w..]

;B[kg];W[jg];B[kf];W[jf];B[je];W[ec]C[Rob A big move];B[ig]L[jl]C[Rob -  but now w must  draw back and connect at k8 (a)..]
;W[gb]C[Rob- Hmm..];B[if];W[jk];B[ji];W[il]L[hb]M[jd][ij][ii]C[Rob- This might be  a mistake for w. I think h18 (a) is bigger than the two marked stones. h18  (a) deprives b of territory, gains for w, and threatens to connect the marked  w stone. Big move..]
;B[hb];W[fa];B[ha]L[ej]C[Rob- A little slow.. I like e10 (a), a nice 1 pt sente..]
;W[se];B[sf];W[sd];B[rf];W[ob];B[pb]L[nb]C[Rob- Again, this does little.. Just o18 (a)..]

 JamesL 18k : try undo];C[Rob- The difference here was that w could have made his LR  corner live or get ko,  and b stopped it, after a mistake by w. However, I think b had the game won  after surrounding the k16 stone on a large scale, and it would not have been  so  close if b had run away with his k4 stone earlier..    You played pretty well though, and should take my comments with a grain of  salt. I'm not sure if I'm any better than you. Despite that, I hope you find  my comments helpful. :)

Also, very sorry it took so long to respond. I've been very busy with a new  job, and had to work this weekend, unexpectedly..]
