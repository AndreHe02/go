(;B[fj]C[black is happy, but maybe G11 or H12 stronger? black would have played G9 in an even game....

I like G12, playing closer to the weaker group.  Your move is good though, since it threatens to seal the center so it forces a response.]
;W[fl]C[seems slow.

no, this big.  Otherwise you can seal off the center.];B[hd]
;W[bd];B[hk]C[I prefer C17 to keep the pressure on white's group while taking some points.  Your move surrounds a strong group.]
;W[hl];B[il];W[hm]C[of course, black considered J6 but decided lower stones could live small.

It's odd to start in this area, and then leave so early.  you need another move here.  Your move at H9 looks like you want to make a wall facing right, but then you tenuki and leave a hole at j7.]
;B[if]C[I prefer to attack at c17.  points in the corner are easier to keep than in the center.]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[qf]
(;B[qi]C[This is an unusaul pincer.  Normally black plays one line closer to attack white more strongly, or one line lower to defend the edge.]

(;B[oe];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[od]C[It's important to play first in the corner instead of this move.]
;W[oc]C[zaphod [3k\]: i hate empty triangles :)];B[ne]C[cbox [3d\]: :), me too
cbox [3d\]: :p];W[me]C[black not used to this; what is best plan? ie plan, not tactic.

When you block at R16 yor plan should be to make a wall facing down.  There is a lot of potential territory on the right edge, and if white tries to escape with the R14 stone, you have a target to attack.

In this shape you want to get S17 pretty early, otherwise white will play at s16 and force you into an ugly shape.]

(;B[pg]C[I would play s17 instead, or N14 or n16.  This move surrounds a very small territory when white plays S16, and your stones are also a little short of liberties.]
;W[rd];B[md]C[ok?];W[nc];B[ld];W[re]C[This is a good result for white.  The corner is big and the upper edge is still open.

It looks like black is trying for one big territory in the center and ignoring the corners.  This is a dangerous strategy.]
;B[mg]C[I don't like this move.  If you want to make a move here to capture N15, play at N14 and capture it.  This move leaves aji and doesn't help your wall any more than N15 does.

With your plan to surround the center, now would be a good time to play J7.]

If you take territory in the center those stones will be settled.]
;B[pl];W[qk];B[qm];W[rm]
(;B[rp]C[I don't like this move.  The corner is open on the other side, so it is not taking any territory.  You have a big potential center, and this is your chance to convert it to territory.]

;W[le]C[is this a reasonable move? it felt like this was the turning point of the game

White is abandoning a weak group in the lower right.  This is your chance to attack it and get a big win.]

(;B[ke]C[I like extending, since it doesn't leave the cut behind.  Let this white group run away while you build strength in the center to kill the lower right.

Your move is also good, but you have to keep white short of liberties so he can't come back and cut.]
;W[lf]C[zaphod [3k\]: slow connection
cbox [3d\]: empty trangle..:D]
(;B[lh]C[I would fill a liberty to keep more pressure on white.  And your shape is stronger if you play at M13.  There won't be any place to cut later.  You will get very thick in the center if white saves these stones.  If white doesn't save them, you will gain a lot of points.

This move is too soft.];W[kd];B[rj]TR[lh]C[Good.  your center is stronger because of triangle move..]
;W[ph];B[qg];W[rk];B[kc]C[Are you so confident that the lower right write group is dead? I would want to add another stone.  It seems if you kill the lower right group and keep much of the center, you have to win.]

(;B[hg]C[blunder? black under time pressure - wanted to play around K11 but didnt have enough time to read it

K11 would be much better.  Assuming the lower right white group dies, you have a big win.  You must play conservatively since there is lots of aji in the center.  You are way ahead, so you don't want to fight.  You want to make the game simpler.

Cutting here just starts a big unclear fight in the center.  Force white to connect instead while making your win solid.

There is no reading here for K11.  you are just surrounding a big territory.]
;W[kh];B[ki]C[same thing; first thought was M10, but....];W[hf]
;B[ii];W[ie];B[id];W[jf];B[ic]C[zaphod [3k\]: that one doesnt cunt:)
zaphod [3k\]: count!];W[li]C[the key cut, or so black thinks - but maybe the key move was earlier?

Atari from the other side looks interesting.  The plan is to give up the upper right in exchange for the lower right and a big center.

Intercepting at n10 looks like it might just capture white's lower right group.]

(;B[mi];W[lj];B[mj];W[mk];B[lk];W[kj];B[ji];W[kk];B[ll];W[nh]
C[is there a defence to this?

Why not just connect and keep the big center?  It seems simpler.]

(;W[hj]C[securing the win?

no.  the game is still close if black plays a good endgame.  For white, I would live in the upper left first (probably in sente), then try to capture the center stones.]

(;B[gj]C[I like J9 better, since it give white more chances to make a mistake and let you save the center stones.

k9 might be even better.

If you save the center, white will live in the upper left in sente and the game will still be close.]
