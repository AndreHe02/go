C[Hi,

I'm Bob (SirBowen on KGS), and I'm doing the review for Go Teaching Ladder.

You didn't really call out specific questions, so I tried to concentrate on making comments that illustrate general principles of play that you can use in future games.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[cq];B[gd];W[pj];B[ph];W[pm];B[qn];W[qm]
;B[qj];W[qk];B[rj];W[nq];B[no];W[ip]LB[kq:B][lp:A]C[This move probably should be at A or B, to connect with your O3 stone. This gives you a solid position from which to attack Black's strangely-shaped corner.]
;B[lq]LB[mp:A]C[However, Black's attack isn't really right. He's left it unconnected to the other side; if you ran out at A you'd be able to split Black in two and almost certainly get out.]

(;W[lp]C[A contact move like this is often a good idea when trying to escape a weak stone/group.

However, you generally don't want to do it against the weaker side. Contact moves generally force both sides to get stronger, and you don't want to strengthen his weak stones.

Also, see variation for how running through the gap instead might have played out.]
;B[mq];W[mp];B[np];W[oq];B[pq];W[kq];B[nr];W[lr];B[mr];W[kr]
;B[or];W[lc]C[Good time to take sente. You generally want to go for the largest open area, though, which is the left side.]
;B[nc];W[ic];B[hc];W[hd]LB[id:A]C[The standard response to a contact move like this is to just extend at A. It's so standard, in fact, that you probably just want to make it a reflex. It may not always be the best move, but it usually is, and it will almost never be wrong.

The reason is the cutting point at A. Black didn't play it immediately, but if he had your top-center group would have been in trouble.]
;B[fc];W[hb];B[gc];W[oo]LB[cf:C][df:B][id:A]TR[hc][gd][gc][fc]
C[Aside from the lingering cutting point at A, another thing to notice is that Black's marked group is now approaching your upper-left corner (much like a knight's-move approach to a star-point corner). A move such as B or C would be appropriate.]

(;B[on]C[Black got all fancy here and lost a lot. He should have just simply captured the two stones (see variation). One shouldn't underestimate the value of the obvious, solid response!]
;W[pn];B[po];W[qo];B[rn];W[ro];B[om];W[rq];B[rp];W[qp];B[qq]
;W[sp];B[rr];W[rm];B[oj];W[sr];B[rs];W[ok];B[pi];W[ol];B[pk]
;W[pl];B[pj];W[nm]C[Since you can't kill Black, and you don't need this move to live, this would be another chance to get the open left side.]
;B[nn];W[ml];B[rk]C[I'm not sure what Black was going for here - there's no threat at all. Certainly he should be going for the open area, too.]
;W[dk]C[Yes!];B[df]
(;W[dh]C[Now that Black is on both sides of your corner, it's pretty urgent to make a play there rather than approach from the outside. See variations for some possibilities.]
;B[cc]C[Now there's not much for you to do about the corner. It's probably best to write it off and just use the white corner stone as leverage to gain something on the outside.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd];B[ed];W[ab];B[ba];W[ef];B[ee]
;W[de];B[cf];W[bf];B[eg];W[ff];B[dg];W[ch];B[bg];W[cg];B[be]
;W[ae];B[af];W[fh];B[ad];W[fg]C[The next 80 moves or so is mainly just fighting over the center.

I've put in a few comments, but mainly there's not a lot to say in a review since it's mostly just a matter of learning to count liberties, see threats, etc. In general you do well, out-reading your opponent in several places. But in the end it catches up to you and you lose several groups in the center.

The main thing I can say is to make sure you know what you're fighting FOR. Often in a big fight you can't save everything, so you should decide what to give up on purpose and what to save.]
;B[ce];W[bh];B[eh];W[ei];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[he];B[gf];W[hg]
LB[hh:A]C[You had the right idea here for jumping out with your threatened group - "play at the center of 3 stones".

But when the jump is pre-peeped like this, it doesn't really work. If you had played just one point lower, at A, it would have been uncuttable.]
;B[gg];W[gh];B[ge];W[hf];B[hh];W[hi];B[ih];W[gi];B[gk];W[fk]
;B[gj];W[mi]LB[ij:B][id:A]C[I'm not totally sure what your intend was here. I take it that it was a dual-purpose move - a ladder break for the cut at A, and something for your endangered group to run to?

One problem is that it doesn't actually work as a ladder break (see variation on the next move to play out the ladder if Black had cut.)

Another problem is that it's too far away for your group to tun to, and you really needed a move like B to run out.

These are the reasons why we don't like to leave a cutting point like A in the first place. They always seem to come back to haunt you at some critical point.]

(;B[ij];W[ii];B[ji];W[jh];B[gb]
(;W[ha]LB[id:A]TR[ih][hh]C[For the next several moves, you had the chance to just capture the marked group and save everything in one stroke.

Black would have pretty much been toast at that point; saving this one stone along the edge was certainly not worth it.

I presume that you were confident in your ability to ladder the marked group. But the ladder doesn't actually work, even if the cutting point at A weren't there. And even if it did work now, it's easy for the fighting to change that.

Again, don't underestimate the value of the obvious, secure move.]

;B[oh];W[gl]C[Black gained a lot in the fighting - it went from being about even to Black being ahead by about 20 points.

Fortunately, you took about the only viable course from here - you'd need to both hang on to the huge area in the lower-left, and also invade Black's area in the upper-right.]
;B[hl];W[hm];B[eo]C[Black didn't pick a very good invasion point, I don't think. It's just floating where he can't make a base and can't really threaten anything to get a foothold.]
;W[dp];B[dn];W[cn]LB[fq:A]C[This is a case where you'd want to avoid contact moves. As mentioned before, contact play tends to build up both sides, and you don't want to build up his weak stones. Here it would be better to keep your plays at a distance (say, at A) to defend while not giving him anything to leverage against.

Black got a lot closer to succeeding with this invasion than he should have (within 1 liberty of killing your corner), mainly because you got too close here.]

C[The invasion in the upper-right is urgent. Fortunately Black didn't use any of his next few moves to secure the corner, but you shouldn't give him the chance.

(I'll also note that your top-central group needs a move to defend it, but that's more advanced reading - and, besides, since you're behind you need to do the invasion, anyway.)]
;B[ql];W[rl];B[ll];W[qc]C[Nicely done. Invading this corner (without losing the top-center group in the process) saved the game for you.]
