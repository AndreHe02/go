C[jadoube [6k\]: hi];B[pd]C[Muttley [6k\]: Hi!  Have fun!

Comments By Eitan Aharoni, 4d];W[dc];B[pq]C[Muttley [6k\]: if you get net lag, tell me]
;W[dq];B[qk];W[ce]C[jadoube [6k\]: will do - should be ok, I'mat work]
;B[jp]C[Muttley [6k\]: :-)

E: when W has a shimari facing the upper side, the upper side is bigger, although K4 is consistent with the intention to attack W when he plays Q5.]
;W[nd]C[good direction, but this move is for special purposes: when B plays Q14, W L16, W has no play into the corner from O16, which means the result is locally better for B.]
;B[pf];W[jj]C[B K16 now would attack O16, and it has no entrance to the corner. anso it would deflate the structure W is aiming at.]
;B[do]C[Would it have been better to play Q5 and try and consolidate?

E: no, the upper side is still the focus. But compared to D5, Q5 is superior because it creates a " double wing formation".]
;W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[br];B[ck];W[qh]MA[jd]C[E: see how this stone ties O16, K10 and the shimari together ? W  should be aiming there. Don't invade when you have weak stones nearby, you just give the opponnt 2 targets.]
;B[oh]MA[qf]C[I wasn't sure about this. The thinking was to prepare an attack on the O16 stone but i'm not sure it was the best way to play the invasion.

E: I would close the corner to deny W easy settlement, and when W jumps out to P12, play O14.]
;W[pj]C[with this move, W says he is willing to pay a price - the wall B builds facing his corner - to seperate R9 and P12. But this is attacking thinking, and W should be deending here. the 3 W stones above are strong, noy an object for attack. Just play R15 for fast settlement.]
;B[pk];W[oj];B[ok];W[nj];B[ml]C[Better to just kep pushing along building the straight wall?

E: no this is fine, W is helping you - take it. The knight's move is correct form here.]
;W[po]C[This is asking for trouble. W should come under severe attack. A better entry point would be M4 .]

(;B[qp]C[I now  think Q4 would be better

E: this is good, blocking the corner. W can't play R5 - too heavy. Still, R4 has a feeling of being forced, next L5 or around M4 would be better than before. So I'd play O4 (see variation).]
;W[ln]C[good.];B[lj]C[I thought about playing outside white's last stone, say at L8 - would this have been a good idea?

E: L8 helps W to play K6 and get out. You had the right idea - attack the heavy weak group, then see what can be done about M6. M4 later seems good enough to me.M10 is an urgent point.]
;W[nh];B[ng];W[mh];B[mg]C[this pushes W out, what he wants to do anyway, and nullifies M10. Better to press at O15, then if W chooses to defend it - play L12 (what is called 'a leaning attack' ). and if W chooses to get O10 group out, you have a satisfying continuation at N16.]
;W[lh];B[no]C[Was it better to play N4 or similar to just take some bottom territory?

E: yes, W M4 now is severe.
Try to develop a feeling for moves that cut through shape, like M12 seperates N13 and M10 and gets out, like B L8 W M6 , and now if W plays M4, K4 is seperated and M6 transforms from a reducing move to an attacking one. This is also due to the strength W built up at line 12, while you played the almost non-effective moves at O13 and N13 (that should have been leaning at O15 etc. ).]
;W[lp]C[good.];B[mq];W[nn]C[good - W is trying to seperate B.
Go is very much a game of "divide and conquer".];B[mn]C[this shouldn't work, see variation.]

(;W[mo]C[this is not bad either. It gives B a large territory on the left, but if W takes sente to play M3, he is way ahead.]
;B[on];W[mm];B[nm];W[mn];B[oo];W[nl];B[om];W[ll]C[very ineffective move, W is already strong there. M3 is huge.]
;B[kd]C[at last ! this area was crying for attention for so long.]
;W[ci]C[I suppose W wants force B to play E9, then turn to around J16, but this is taking a risk. If B ignores the threat to develop the top and survives the attack on his lower-left group, B will be back in the game.  All said, I'd still play M3 (for both sides).]
;B[hd]C[I ended up wishing this was on the third line. But was there a better move elsewhere? Perhaps a local response to the last move.

E: the fourth line is natural here, as the center is important.

Just to drive the point in, I estimate M3 move to be worth about 50 points.]
;W[dm]C[this is not good enough - W can press and build a wall, but end in gote, so B plays M3 that becomes even bigger when W guilds this wall.]
;B[cm];W[dn];B[cn];W[dl];B[cl];W[eo];B[lq]C[B leads the game now.
By the way, if W L3, B must play K3, not L4.];W[lf]C[to what aim ?

now the difficulty to settle O16 becomes all too obvious. If W enters the corner, B will be happy to block to the left, as the right is reduced by R12.]
;B[me];W[le];B[ld];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[qd]C[It's difficult for me to read if the kill is possible, more so in a game. better just connect and let W extend in gote to a worthless area - B has a solid lead.]
;W[nb];B[nc];W[oa]
(;B[mb]C[ouch ! W gets both assured life and reducing B's area... see variation for trying a kill.]
;W[oc];B[mc];W[od];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[of];B[og];W[pe];B[qe]
;W[mf];B[md]C[I think O14 was better?

E: definitely :) it connects all your groups together, and W will have to play T18 to live.]
;W[nf];B[qg]C[B ends in gote, and not assured of life yet.]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[gc]C[Bad style - F17 is the local move. When B responds at H17, the G17 stone is weak.

S14 should kill the B group.

W leads now - even if R13 group lives : B has about 60 points, W 25 at upper left, over 10 in lower left, and huge central potential.]
;B[hc];W[fe]C[H14 better locally, and helps cover M13 weakness.]
;B[lg]C[This was not good I think.

If B takes gote to assure life for this group, B may as well resign. So trying to make something out of W's weakness was right.
See variation.]
(;W[jf]C[this can't be good.];B[kg];W[je];B[jd]C[G18 is better.]
;W[jg];B[kh]C[W should start taking care here.];W[ki];B[jh]
;W[hf];B[ji];W[kj];B[hi]C[very, very bad result for W.];W[fi]
;B[bq]C[J10 is more vital. Also D4 is mutual sente.

Let's count again :
B has some 65 points, maybe a little more.
W has some 40 pts on top, and will be hard pressed to get 20 more in the center and bottom, but it's not impossible. open game.

It's important to stop regularly to count the game - it gives you a good grip on what's going on and what you need to win.]
;W[iq];B[ip]C[too greedy !];W[jq];B[kq];W[kp]C[this B group should die.]
;B[hq];W[hr];B[ir];W[jr];B[gr];W[is]C[W should have played atari at H4, then capture the K4 stones. Even if the remaining B stones live or connect, next J10 seals the center. Try it out.]
;B[gp];W[fq];B[gq];W[kr];B[lr];W[ks]
(;B[gs]C[I think this was unnecessary at this stage

E: no harm either.];W[hs];B[go]C[Need to jump more?

E: this looks ok - a W stone there is a forcing move - but B is not alive yet. As W, I'd attack at H6. But if W doesn't kill, he loses, so B has the advantage. Avoid situations that stake the whole game on a kill.]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[np]
(;B[mp]C[Oh well :(

E: My personal favourite phrase in these cases is Ouch :)];W[mr]
;B[oq];W[ls]C[ok , count again...

B had now some 55 pts.
W has some 65, and komi.

So W has no need to kill, just play safe, make normal endgame moves, that's all.]
;B[fo];W[dp];B[gl];W[co];B[bo];W[gm]C[E: Oh, winning on points is so BORING... why don't we go look for some trouble.]
;B[fm];W[hm];B[er];W[dr];B[eq];W[ep];B[fr];W[es];B[dj];W[ek]
;B[ej];W[fl]C[W is determined to give B a chance.];B[en];W[do]
;B[fk];W[em];B[fn];W[gk];B[el];W[aq];B[bp]C[Better to have lost the three stones and played D9? I was wanting to keep up the attack but it failed.

Hard to say. The question is, is it enough to win. with D10 and E10 in place, W's upper area is very reducible, for example C13. I believe youwould have a chance, though W is still better off. The thing is, W has 3 more local ko threats with B6 etc, and is very solid elsewhere, so it seems you can't kill this group. So bottom line is, yes, you should play D9.]
;W[fl]
(;B[oe]C[Losy threat - would H8 produce more - is there something better?

E: Yup, this is no threat. And yes, H8 threatens to capture the W 2 stones - see variation. I don't see a ko threan of this magnitude against another W group.]
;W[hl]C[game over, really.];B[ne];W[bj]C[scottw [2k\]: w needs t18

E: true.];B[dh];W[di];B[ei];W[ch];B[eg]C[I think this was not the best]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[fj];B[bk];W[ak];B[al];W[bm];B[bn];W[am]C[bad killing style - A4 better.]
;B[aj]C[scottw [2k\]: wrong

But I'm not sure what's right.

E:

B C13, W B13, B B12.];W[ai]C[wrong too, of course - just play C13, let B get life in seki at A4.]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[cj];W[ak];B[bh]C[scottw [2k\]: a11 should be at c13
E: W still winning, just play T18 . Next biggest move is G18.
I wonder if W would win even if B got T18. The response to R10 was wrong, of course.

Both opponents do not lack fighting spirit. points for consideration - judging magnitude of moves, as in M3 and the upper side, that both sides missed for several moves; and very important - count the game and know where you stand, so you'll know where to Go :)  
Comments end here, email me if you have further questions.

Best of luck !

;W[cf];B[ag];W[be];B[gd];W[fc]C[scottw [2k\]: w still ahead, but this is painful]

;W[ec];B[qj];W[oi];B[rh];W[or];B[pr];W[ns]C[scottw [2k\]: wonder how long t18 will remain unplayed?]
;B[ij]C[There must have been something better than this - I imagined i would somehow build up some threat to do something in the middle - no idea what now I look at it with plenty of time.]
;W[ik];B[mk];W[nk]C[teabag [8k\]: r18 kills it too];B[qi]C[scottw [2k\]: true, but t18 for w lives]

;W[hn]C[jadoube [6k\]: thanks
scottw [2k\]: guys...uppre right is unsettled
scottw [2k\]: t18 key point
Muttley [6k\]: sorry, ididn't realise you'd run down.
Muttley [6k\]: is there anyway we can add time to yours?
scottw [2k\]: not anymore
jadoube [6k\]: throw in Q19 if t18?
Muttley [6k\]: damn.   sorry
jadoube [6k\]: no problem
Muttley [6k\]: they're dead, sure?
scottw [2k\]: no
scottw [2k\]: if w plays t18 he lives
Muttley [6k\]: interesting!
Muttley [6k\]: i see now.
scottw [2k\]: yes, b playing q19 doesn't help, w just r19 and has eyes at q19 and corner
Muttley [6k\]: yep
jadoube [6k\]: yes
Muttley [6k\]: funny how go plays tricks on you when you're playing!
Muttley [6k\]: that sort of pseudo false eye is just the sort things problemist like
Muttley [6k\]: :-)
jadoube [6k\]: thats very true
Muttley [6k\]: though i guess it should have been obvious to us!
jadoube [6k\]: but we were going too fast to see it
Muttley [6k\]: you outplayed me for long part sof the game
Muttley [6k\]: yes we were.
jadoube [6k\]: and vice versa :)
Muttley [6k\]: but it was interesting
Muttley [6k\]: god, that invasion at the bottom!
jadoube [6k\]: yes, losing the bottom / middle was a big blow
Muttley [6k\]: i agree
Muttley [6k\]: we were both a little too greedy at times, i think
Muttley [6k\]: i wanted half the board!
jadoube [6k\]: yes, play safe is always hard when you think its close
Muttley [6k\]: mmm.
Muttley [6k\]: Chinese fuseki.....
Muttley [6k\]: i always have difficulties with that one
jadoube [6k\]: I've been reading Charles matthews articles at the mso site - very good
jadoube [6k\]: normally I'd not play it
Muttley [6k\]: rui naiwei always duffs it up!  - where is/what is the mso site?
jadoube [6k\]: just a sec i'll get the URL
Muttley [6k\]: thx
scottw [2k\]: b should have died along the left side as well, btw
Muttley [6k\]: btw?
scottw [2k\]: by the way
Muttley [6k\]: mmm.
jadoube [6k\]: http://www.msoworld.com/
scottw [2k\]: should have played c13 instead of a11, and b has a very hard time living
Muttley [6k\]: that's great!  thnx
jadoube [6k\]: follow the links to the go section, at the bottom there's a section called on your side - well worth a look
Muttley [6k\]: thank you very much!
Muttley [6k\]: I'll have a look
jadoube [6k\]: yes the side was touch and go but a4 at least give a seki?
Muttley [6k\]: i'm not certain
Muttley [6k\]: because of w playing a6
Muttley [6k\]: connecting at a10
Muttley [6k\]: before taking at a8
Muttley [6k\]: then the snapback doesn't help you
jadoube [6k\]: well it depends - if B got a9 - which was ok at the time - if I recall correctly
Muttley [6k\]: but that is a lot of moves for w!
Muttley [6k\]: exactly!
jadoube [6k\]: not really sure though - it will be worth playing over another day  Muttley [6k\]: b plays a few move in between!
Muttley [6k\]: fierce game!
Muttley [6k\]: I look forward to playing you again sometine
jadoube [6k\]: yes - you got so far ahead i had to push in and take risks
jadoube [6k\]: yes, another would be good
Muttley [6k\]: certainly!  c u around
jadoube [6k\]: anyway I'm afraid i have to head off home, see you around
