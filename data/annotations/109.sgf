(;B[cg]C[This is the first move  that reveals that this game isn't from the
Honinbo tournament. :) Both players have - as far as I can tell -
up to this point successfully imitated pros' style. What makes this
move inferior to the joseki move (var. B) is that black is taking
liberties off his own group, thus making it easier for white to close
off the left side.];W[ce];B[be];W[dg]
(;B[dh]L[fq][me]M[nn][qm][po][qp][qq]C[This is IMHO too aggressive. The purpose of a cut, is to make the enemy
weaker by splitting him up. Therefore the player who makes the cut
must have reasonable attacking possibilities against at least one,
preferably both of his opponents cut-off groups. It's also helpful
if the cutting group is backed up by some thickness in the neighborhood.

In this case, white's wall above is too tall and strong to be a good target,  and white's cut-off stone can take care of itself, starting
with a sente move against black's edge followed up by an atari, as in
the game. Black's cutting stone will only be a burden to him if he
decides to try to keep it alive.

I don't know what's best for black on the left edge; whatever he tries,
white can seal him in. See var. B. Maybe he should tenuki. My alternatives:  1) a kakari (F6 [a\]) against white's lower left, or 2) a moyo-building move  around N15 [b\], which will make an attack against the white marked group  much more profitable.]
;W[bh];B[bf]L[bg]C[This is wrong, black should play at B13 [a\] to take an  important liberty
off the two white stones. Never mind the white hane with atari.];W[di];B
[eh];W[cl]L[bg][ci][cj]C[If black had played B13 [a\],  white couldn't make this nice extension,
but would instead have to protect the cut at C11 [b\] by playing C10 [c\].
Still, black's cutting group is without a base and purpose.];B[ei]L[cj]
C[Is is highly questionable to try to save  these stones. White is healthy
on both sides, so the group isn't really a cutting group, merely a heavy
lump of stones nailed against white's wall. They *do* have some aji,
however, (imagine a black stone around C10 [a\] in some future fight)
but move 37 erases this aji.];W[dj];B[cn]L[fq]C[This  is too aggressive and from the wrong direction. Black is offering
white yet another group to attack. White's group above is not weak enough for  this to be worthwhile. He is also forcing white to make territory on
the lower side, where he would have liked to make territory for himself,
by playing a kakari at E3 [a\], for example.];W[ep];B[en];W[fk];B[hh];W
[hf]L[db]C[White's territory above  is open at the edge, so this move isn't very
effective. Maybe now is the time to close the gap at D18 [a\].];B[fc]L[eb][db][ff]C[Better to make the one point jump reduction (E18  [a\]). If white closes off
the edge (D18 [b\]), black will have severe problems living here. Isolating
white's wall at F14 [c\] isn't likely to succeed either.];W[gg];B[eb]C[Very good! Big point indeed. White's largest  territory has been ruined.]
;W[gh];B[gn];W[fo];B[fn];W[hp];B[gp]L[in]C[I don't think this works. See variation  for white's move #56!
How about a one point jump to J6 [a\] instead?];W[go];B[ho]
(;W[hq]C[How about atari (variation B)?];B[eo];W[fp];B[hn];W[lq]C[This invasion strengthens black,  which could have consequences for
white's unsettled group on the right side.];B[lp]C[Good.];W[jr];B[mq];W
[kq];B[bq]L[rl][rm][om]C[I think this is the time to start  harassing white's group on the
right. One way to start is S8 [a\]. If white answers S7 [b\], then
black can destroy white's eye shape with P7 [c\].];W[cp];B[bp];W[co];B[bo]
;W[bm];B[cr];W[dr];B[er];W[ds];B[bn];W[pb]M[jd][nc]C[I don't  like this exchange. With this move, white is saying:
"You'll get the corner and I'll take the top." But since the top is
open at the left and white's extension (marked) is wide, black can easily
invade and destroy white's top. White has also lost his chance to do a
3-3 invasion and has strengthened Black. I think White should aim at an  invasion on the right, but first he must settle his group in lower right.]
;B[qc];W[kp];B[ic];W[jc];B[ib];W[lo];B[lc]M[ib]L[me]C[I don't know if I like this move. Black's  marked stone makes it unlikely
for white to make any territory here anyway. If he can make more than 25
pts on the upper half of the right side, he has good chances in this
game. Therefore a move around N15, to enlarge that area, is worth
considering.];W[jb];B[le];W[ne];B[lg];W[ng]C[Black is chasing White into what could have become his own  territory. :-(]
;B[nf]L[jf][ph]C[Black isn't being patient enough. Pushing  through a one space jump
this early in a fight is almost always bad. It only strengthens
white and is thus aji-keshi. If black wants to strengthen his line
of stones, K14 [a\], which makes shape and threatens to cut off the three
white stones looks possible. A one point jump on the side, O12 [b\], would
take profit and make a cut later more effective.];W[of];B[mf];W[oe];B[pg]
