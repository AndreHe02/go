C[pajaro: Hi. I am playing black in this game, against an opponent 2 stones=
 stronger than me. Although I lost, I think I didn't do too badly. So I'd l=
ike to know my biggest mistakes so I can rise a few stones :)

For the record, I will add some comments starting with pajaro]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]
(;B[fp]LB[fq:A]C[you should reserve the high kakari for sitations where  you have strong support on the right to build either territory
or attack a pincer effectively. The low kakarai is much more flexible
in general.]

(;W[jp]
(;B[gq]C[w cannot make a base here anyway. so this attack seems slow
my feeling is that you should just continue to develop with normal moves  you cannot hope to launch a successful attack so early in the game because
w can easily run into the center. Later in the game there might be a situation
when you can start a stronger attack on these stones.];W[hq]

(;B[go]C[this move looks ugly. if you think it was necessary because of a splitting attck on F5
your strategy before was questionable.]

C[pajaro: Well, I lost. As I can't see any major tactical mistake, I suppos=
e my direction of play isn't very good. It is hard for me to know when to l=
eave a battle and switch to anything else. Any comments about that?

The major tactical errors in this game were:
1)letting w split your groups with B33
2)waiting too long with the push at C6
3)letting w live in the lower right])
