(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]VW[]C[I get a huge lead, then make 2 huge losses and lose by only 3.5  points. I'm interested in how I open, and later, how to avoid the 2 big  errors, and then the most important, how I may have kept the win in the  endgame after the losses.


Now that I'm done reviewing this thing, I think my own biggest mistake
in perception is the size of black's ko threat in the lower left
corner that white chooses to ignore.  White had plenty of big ko
threats left, and nearly gave the game back to black by not answering
that ko threat.

Overall, this was an interesting and fun game.  I'm afraid I may have
focussed too much on the negative in my comments.  The strength of
black's game is the consistency; once he sees the potential to make a
huge moyo, he sticks with it and ends up with a successful strategy.
The main weakness of black's game is that he keeps struggling too hard
even when he has a 30 point lead.  This gives white chances for an upset.]

;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq]C[One thing you should know about  this joseki; as white takes the corner,
it is territorially favorable for white.  Hence black can only play it
in situations where the stone at K3/4 at the end is very good for him.
With the star-point stone at Q4, it is of course a fine choice of
joseki.];W[dq];B[fp];W[cj]C[The game looks pretty normal up to this move.

White needs a stone around C6 or D5 to protect against black C5.
Now black can press white down in sente, gaining thickness.
In situations where the stone at Q4 is white. white can consider
playing around K3 and letting black play C5, as an exchange (though
I would still prefer the usual joseki).

Here, white's stone at C10 loses its meaning as soon as black plays C5.]
;B[co]C[ML> It seemed important to 'punish' the non-joseki immediately,  though  I don't know how.

C5 is exactly correct.  Very good!  Now white gets pressed low while
black gets outside strength in sente.];W[bo];B[bp]C[This crosscut might be a  bit of an overplay, though it looks fairly
reasonable.  Simply playing C6 and letting white play on the second
line is VERY good for black, especially in the opening.    The second line
is the line of defeat.  White gains only one point of territory per
move, with no prospects for expansion, while black gains outside strength
worth at least one point in the local context, plus more in the whole
board situation.];W[bq]C[Capturing immediately like this looks too passive.   I would want to try
B6, I think.];B[bn];W[ap];B[cn]C[Black has ended with gote in return for  sealing white in with B6.
I think the moves around B6 are too small to be worth taking gote, hence
I would have just played C6 at the beginning without B4 or B6, taking
sente for sure.

Also, without the sacrifice stone at B4, black's move at D4 will probably
be sente threatening C3, which makes black's thickness stronger.];W[jc]
C[A  big move, indeed, but with black's thickness, his area is much
bigger.  White should probably play R6, or maybe R10, instead of this
move.  Q10 is now very good for black.  R6 is probably playable, too.
Anything which makes it harder for white to reduce black's right
and lower side moyo is huge.  Q10 is my favorite.];B[pj]C[Very nice.];W
[nc]C[This feels a little too slow for white.  White will only get territory on
the upper side and lower left corner, while black has a huge double-wing
formation and a lot of thickness.];B[ne]C[ML> now I wouldn't play this, since  I don't have anything on bottom middle.
  Simply
attaching would probably be okay.

I think this move is fine.  You don't need a stone at K4 since you
have so much thickness in the lower left already.  O16 is probably
fine, as is the even simpler Q14.  I like Q14 better, since
attaching helps make the big extension look good for white.  Q14
aims at M17 later.  If white plays O15 you can still play O13 then.];W[pb]
C[Too slow for white.  R17 is clearly better; you still have to let him
link up, so he gains a lot more territory.];B[jp]C[Q18 is on the second line,  so it doesn't have to be answered, but
R17 is huge territorially AND aims at invading at M17, so I would play
it right away.  I think it is much bigger than K4.

In fact, K4 feels too biased toward the thickness on the lower left.
You should probably play farther away from your strength
(O3 or O4, perhaps)];W[qd]C[White doesn't waste any time taking advantage  of your missing move
at R17.
Just playing R17 is simpler, but white is behind so tries for something
extra.  I don't see any easy way to punish R16,so it's probably
reasonable.  R15 looks like the best answer.];B[qe];W[qc];B[je]C[S15 would be  very big too, strengthening your side and taking away
corner territory, but I like your large-scale thinking here better.

You might consider playing M16 to reduce a bit first, but that wuold
probably be a thank-you move (taking away white's weakness).

More subtly, you might consider invading at M17 and using that as
a sacrifice stone to build up a lot of outside strength.

K15 is an excellent move, though.  It builds up your moyo a lot, while
simultaneously flattening out white.];W[hd]C[Too conservative for white.   It's time to reduce your moyo before it's
too late.  White can't afford to spend time taking these few points of
territory on the side.

White should either invade (at R13, R8, or R6, I'm not sure which)
or play R3 and then reduce out around L10.

Now you get the perfect opportunity to play around the center
point and make a huge moyo.

You could also try to invade C17 in sente first, but sente isn't
guaranteed and besides you might rather invade C14 to attack the C10
stone (making use of B6!)];B[le]C[ML>Not sure what I'm thinking. Perhaps to  jump down into M17, but that  doesn't seem
so important. Maybe just defending my K15 stone.  I don't think I like it,
 but what is better?

I agree.  This move is too slow.  M17 takes away 10+points of territory,
but since you let white get the corner, he is alive for sure.  So M17
is not a big threat.

Defending your K15 stone is a reasonable thought, but better to do that
out around K10 to complete your huge moyo.];W[pe]C[You should rejoice!  White  captures one tiny stone, and you get to
strengthen your outside moyo in sente.

Even if white later captures R15, that is still gote for white, so
you gain even more.];B[pf];W[oe];B[of];W[od];B[jj]C[ML> Now my framework  looks quite large.  I must have made quite an error later to
make me lose.

Hm, yes, the game does look good for you.  On the other hand, you have
moyo, white has territory.

Before K10, you should O16 (if the previous moves were sente, surely
it will be too!)];W[qn]C[White comes in deep, but probably doesn't really  have a choice.  Attack
this stone.  You should get the lower side and the upper half of the
right side turned into territory.];B[qo];W[pn];B[np];W[qk]C[A bad mistake for  white.  Holding back to R8 is much better.  Later,
the weakness of your diagonal move (when you play R9) may haunt you,
as white may be able to invade around R12.  On the other hand, if you
play R10 anyway to keep your shape strong, then white would certainly
rather be at R8.

Q8 is also reasonable.  This "underneath shoulder hit" is almost
always wrong, playable only when white would otherwise die.

White could also attach at R10 here, and then crosscut Q9 if you play
R9.];B[qj];W[pk];B[oj]C[ML>is the hane better?

Good question.  I don't have an easy answer for that.  I think that the
solid shape is probably better, since you are winning the game; why
create a cutting point that white can possibly exploit?  Keep it as
simple as possible if you are ahead.  So I like your move.

If you P9, you maybe gain a few points up top, but the weakness makes
white's move at S10 much stronger, so you may just lose them right
back on the edge.];W[ro]C[Another problematic move for white.  White should  try to strengthen
on the outside, and then jump in to R3.  This loses almost all the
corner aji when you answer at S4.];B[rp];W[po];B[ok]C[ML> this feels wrong  with R5 in atari.

Yes!  Just answer, connect, and then the last shred of corner aji is gone.
Q5-R4 is a good trade for you!  White should not make it.  With Q5-R4
unplayed, white has some chance of making something happen at R3, but
after the trade, there's nothing there.  So yes, P9 is much smaller
than the corner, since the corner also gives white a lot more life,
and white's life here is the real issue in the game right now.];W[ol]C[White  should just have captured R4 right away.
Black has to answer, then white can go here if he wants (though I think
trying to start a ko to dissect the corner would be a great thing for
white)];B[nn]C[ML> I don't think I would do this now. How about O8, or R4?

Perfect.  I agree, this is a mistake .. white just zooms right out
through the hole.  White can probably even get away with jumping out
to N8 here.

R4 would be my choice still, but O8 is not too bad of a second choice.
Taking the corner is huge, both since R4 will be white's sente
and because even after you answer R4 there's still a ko that white
can exploit with a move like Q3.];W[nl];B[qp];W[so]C[Despite white getting  out at O8, black is still doing fine here.
T4 is black's sente, but S9 is probably bigger.
Black can even tenuki now to invade at C14 or C17.  I would pick C14
because it means white has to live with the C10 stone.];B[mj]C[This move  seems too slow.  White's group looks alive, black is certainly
safe and strong, so all this move does is take points, and not even
that many points.  (white N10, black N11 ... or even white N10, black O9
and then cuts, so white can't really reduce too much here anyway.)
If white played M8 or something, then defending would be reasonable.
Even then, defending at M10 seems to be better balance between the
one stone at K10 and the two-stone wall at P9/10.

Anyway, the left side, or the edge (S9) both look bigger.];W[qf]C[This move  is worth more points than your last move.  It's still too small
to play (compare white D14, say) but it gains compared to your N10.];B[qg]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[re];B[ej]C[This looks like the wrong direction.  You help  white defend the weak C10
stone, and you aren't going to make much territory with this move now
that O8 can jump on in to your moyo.

C14 instead, or even C17 which really takes territory, would be more
my style than this move.

If white was sealed in on the right (black instead of white stone at
O8, say) then this would be an outstanding move.];W[dh]C[This move just  cries out for the C17 invasion now.
I might try something fancier (like C14) to try to defend both the
corner and the C10 stone at the same time.];B[cc]C[ML> I've read about the  cap-then-invade like this. Is this the proper way
 to employ
it?

I'm not sure about the cap -- you have helped white take away the
weakness of the C10 stone.  But yes, after the E10-D12 exchange,
the 3-3 invasion is perfect.  It takes away territory and either
D12 or H16 (depending on which way white blocks) will end up
hopelessly overconcentrated.

White should block D17, since the top is bigger.];W[cd]C[This is the wrong  way.  The top is bigger than the left side.
Though in this case, it probably doesn't make a big difference,
the principle is still important.];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[bd]C[ML>error,  pure and simple.]
;W[be]C[I don't think this is joseki for white.];B[ce]C[Hm.   What would you do now if white D15, you extend to C14, then white
B17?]
(;W[bc];B[ed];W[de];B[fc];W[gb]C[G18 seems kinda small, and just  encourages you to live with B18.
M8 for example seems much bigger.];B[gc]C[This move doesn't seem to help too  much.  It solidifies white and doesn't
really help you get out.
Just play F14 straight away, or B18 to live in the corner.];W[hc];B[ee]
;W[df];B[bb]C[If you're going to live in the corner anyway, there's no reason to
strengthen white with those last two moves.
Maybe later, you would have wanted to atari D14 instead to try to
cut off the C10/D12 stones.

In other words, make up your mind -- either really run out, or just
live on the side right away.];W[ad];B[ib]C[This peep loses points.  Without  it, F19 is your sente threatening
H18 in the endgame.  Now, white connects H18 and you have just
given up several points (white had to connect anyway when you play F19,
but now white doesn't have to connect, white might get to play E19
himself, and white gains a prisoner.  So this move loses at least
three points.];W[hb];B[lc]C[Hm.  Perhaps I have to take that last comment  back.  As part of this
attacking strategy, the peep is reasonable.  It makes white's
shape heavier so this moveis more severe.
However, your group is not yet alive in the corner (you need A18) so
this is probably an overplay at this point.  G15 or F13 or A18
are probably better -- you're ahead, so get strong, and don't take
chances.  Once your group is alive, white will have to defend, and then
you get sente somewhere else again, perhaps to cap at M8.];W[kb];B[lb]C
[Rather than defending locally like this (which gives up edge points
and means taking gote with J19 to live), white could try G14
or thereabouts, defending by sealing in the not-yet-alive black
group.];W[ge]C[Similar to when the black group ran, if white is going to play
out here, he's better off without the L18-M18 exchange.];B[ab];W[ff];B[ef]

;W[fg];B[gj]C[You'd be better without the E14/F13 exchange  unless you really planned
to follow through and cut white.  But I agree that defending the moyo
is better than cutting white off and chasing him right into your moyo.]
;W[fh];B[ck]C[This looks small to me compared to M8 or thereabouts, but it's the  right
idea.

White has suffered a huge loss by not playing the boring, normal
joseki in the top right corner.  Black should have an easy win now.
Let's count the territory.

Black:  5 pts UL + almost 30 pts UR + about 40 pts lower side +
some spare change in the lower center, let's call it 75.

White:  14 pts LL + 16 points UL + 5 pts upper side + 20 pts UR +
10 pts right side = 65 + komi = 70.

So, essentially, black is ahead by whatever he can get in that lower
center area.];W[dj];B[dk];W[bk];B[ll]C[Black looks like getting 30 points in that  center area now,

J10 is huge for white (though S9 is of course sente for you) because of
the weakness at L11.  You should probably simply defend J10 first, unless
you are sure of coming out of this region with sente.];W[rl]C[At this point, I would simply connect as black, since that gains a
