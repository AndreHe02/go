Hello!
Thank you for reviewing!
I'm black.
I wrote some questions along the game.
And can you give me some advice?];B[qp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[oq]
;W[pe]C[I didn't know wich joseki to choose in this situation.
What is better?
i tried....-->

Ben: Don't ask the question "what is the best joseki here?" Instead, ask the question "what is the best strategy here?"
To decide on a strategy here, you need to consider the most important surrounding stones, and here that is the strong position in the bottom right.
So I think a good strategy will be to play a pincer, making potential territory on the right while attacking this stone. You certainly don't want to play a joseki that ends up with White getting to play q10, because that neutralises your thickness.]
;B[qe];W[qf]
(;B[re]C[....this... and...

Ben: (I dunno if this is joseki or not) This move looks like it's trying to undermine White's territory, but White doesn't have any territory on the right and never will. This move definitely gives White weakness to attack, and White is definitely light here (White's stones can easily run to the centre, because there are no Black stones above them or on the top side to stop them. So at least, White's stones are now a good reduction, and he can play, say, d10.]

(;W[rf]C[Ben: White shouldn't play here, locally. There's never going to be territory on thei right for White, because of Black's lower right. q16 seemed like the obvious move to me, locally, but I'll have a look at a few more.]
;B[pf]C[...many don't know this joseki... and i cut.

Ben: I don't know this joseki. I don't know if it even is joseki. But it doesn't matter - I'm thinking about the strategy. But the cut probably *is* correct.

Now, can White q16? What about r16?]
(;W[oe]C[Ben: It turns out this is good.];B[pg]
(;W[qd];B[rd]
(;W[qc];B[rc];W[pd];B[rg];W[oc]C[Ben: I conclude that this is a fair result for both (given s15/s14).]
;B[jd]C[I think this is a good move... didn't want to let white to extend from right. Or K17 better?
Or maybe should I attack white group closer?

Ben: There will be no attack against the right, because it is so strong (an eye at q17 and half an eye at p16, and plenty of room to run or make more eyes).

I don't like this move, because it doesn't have enough room to make a comfortable base here and it is between two strong positions. I'd be happy with f17, c14, d10, c6 or f3.]

(;W[jq]C[Ben: White should attack Black at the top. See var.]
;B[fc]C[Ben: This is good. Now you're stable at the top, putting pressure on the top left, and White only got a relatively uninteresting move with k3 (after all, p3 is low).]
;W[cf];B[dc]C[D17 or D18? What is better?

Ben: You don't even have to play here. c6 would be a fine option. Other options are c17, to take the corner (leaving your two stones on the outside to stop White making territory); or f15 to make a strong position; or something like m17. I don't like d18 because it takes away the option of playing c17, gives White territory when he plays c17 and still leaves wekness at h17.

d17 looks okay.];W[cc]
(;B[db]C[Ben: e16 is an important shape point. Black should play there. See var.]

(;W[cb]C[Ben: White should e16. See var.];B[ed];W[de]C[Ben: Even now the d18/c18 exchange isn't good for Black. Without it, the best White could do would be start ko, and it would be a ko White wouldn't want to lose. Plus without it, Black would have c18 for later. Best just not to play d18.]
;B[cn]
(;W[gq]C[Ben: This is a really submissive move, on the third line. It makes only a very small amount of territory, leaves no room for expansion, and doesn't put any pressure on Black. See var.]

(;B[cq]C[Is it good to invade corner in this situation?

Ben: Anything's good from here. c3, b4, c9. Or tenuki.]
(;W[dq]C[Ben: This is just wrong. Should be c4. See var.];B[cp]
;W[do]
(;B[co]C[Ben: Too slow. There are simple moves that are clearly better: b7 would make more territory and still be very connected (for example).]
;W[em];B[lq]C[I know that I have to go to C8, but.... I went here

Ben: Yeah this is small. But so is White's next move at s18. Black should probably d8 instead of here. White should definitely c8 after Black m3.]

(;W[rb]
(;B[ql]C[Ben: You played a low stone (third line) between two strong positions. Why? It doesn't make territory. If you wanted territory, you should have played q8. Or for a moyo, m5. But d8 is still waiting.]
;W[sf]
(;B[sg]C[Ben: No! You should play r13 to completely remove the weakness! This way, White can still force at r12! See var.]
;W[sc];B[qg]C[Ben: Okay, White gives you another chance. But he shouldn't have!]
;W[on]C[Ben: Now you can see that r8 makes it very easy to reduce here.]
;B[pn]C[Probably too agressive. R6 is the usual response, isn't it?

Ben: r6 is too defensive. It's exactly what White wanted. Then he'd be sure exactly how much territory you've got there, and know that no more moves are needed. This fight might work out okay, but remember, contact moves are usually best for defense, because they strengthen both sides. Here, you should try to attack, with m6, n6, or p8. Can you really imagine White's going to waste a move playing r6? It's not like it would attack anything.]
;W[pm];B[qn];W[oo];B[pp]C[Ben: Because you have played only on the inside, White can easily escape. So his moves are now a great reduction, and you are overconcentrated.]
;W[lo]
(;B[iq]C[Maybe L4 is better.

Ben: Yes. L4 is the kind of move that you can be sure is good, because it would take White so many moves to recover from (compared to White l4).]
;W[jp]C[Ben: White's got the right idea. This stops you from connecting, and forces you to live (or die, or run) without the aid of m3.]
;B[kq]C[Ben: This is a bad forcing move. Before this, there was the aji of Black k2 in sente.]
;W[jr];B[hn]C[Ben: This move doesn't achieve anything. If you want to attack, l4 is the perhaps the best way. If you want to reduce. it's best to do it from further away, where you can be sure you won't die.]

(;W[ip]C[Ben: Now White is timid. He should h8. You wouldn't really waste a move saving j3, would you? see var.]

(;B[kr]C[Ben: This move is small and makes an empty triangle. It is okay end-game, but much bigger moves are still on the board, like d8/c8.]
;W[cl]C[Ben: This is a great move.]
(;B[dj]C[Ben: White should attack with f10 or such. This stone has nowhere it can easily go. Now you can expect either h6 or d10 to be captured on a large scale. Black b8 is an interesting move. See var.]
;W[ci]C[Ben: Bad move! White has turned d10 into a great reducing move!]
;B[dm]C[Ben: It's not obvious that this does anything more than strengthen White. But it turns out that it works okay for Black even when White plays d8.]

(;W[cj]C[Ben: White should d8, to keep Black separated. Again, this is timid.]
;B[dl]C[Ben: This is too good for Black. White should not allow it. It makes c8 almost useless.]

(;W[en]C[Ben: This saves a worthless stone. White could try something much more interesting, like h8 to start attacking.]
;B[el];W[gm];B[im]C[Ben: You could just n17, or p7.]
(;W[jn]C[Ben: That cut doesn't need defending.];B[ik];W[kc]
C[Ben: Big move, but again, it's bad shape, playing diagonally under a stone.]
