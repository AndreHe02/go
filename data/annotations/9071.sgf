AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[rush : hallo... this is my first 19x19 game. yeah it really my first time...
there i still confuse deciding: to create territories, or attack foe's group, or connect my groups.
please i waited for good comment :)];W[gc]C[rush : bah, i don't now how to respond it. so,]

(;B[fc]LB[ec:B][fc:A]C[rush : here. is it good or bad?

baudtack: There is a go proverb that says that attaching to a single stone makes it stronger. Generally we want to avoid that. Now handicap go games are... weird to say the least. High handi especially. Generally all black has to do to win is play fairly passively. White has to play SUPER aggresive to get anywhere because s/he is so far behind. Black can also play very aggresive because of his or her great strength, but it can be easy to make a mistake this way.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[mc];B[lc];W[md];B[ld]C[rush : same as before, i think

baudtack: Yep! White has weakness on both sides. Issolated groups that B can harrass if not out right kill. One of the hardest lessons for new players to learn can be that you don't always have to kill an opponents groups. Often it's more than enough to just attack it and profit by doing so. But mastering that will make you a dan :-p]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[cg]C[rush : another attack. how to respond?]

(;B[dg]LB[cf:B][dg:A];W[ch];B[cf];W[gf]CR[fc][dd][fd][cf][dg]
TR[lc][jd][ld]SQ[qf][qg][cm][qm][cn][qn][fq][gq][mq][nq]C[I wouldn't worry about the circled group here. Is it alive? Not 100% but it's very strong and has lots of possibilities.

The triangle group on the other hand is sort of getting surrounded. I would probably want to jump up on that side if I was going to respond to g14 at all. I'd probably be more tempted to ignore it and play any of the squared moves to try to secure more territory.

One problem a lot of beginners have is what is sometimes called "puppy syndrome" You'll follow your opponent around the board like a lost puppy, responding to their every move. Figuring out what you need to respond to takes a lot of practice but here are some ideas to get you started.


Does this move threaten to kill one of my groups?

What is the follow up to this move for my opponent if I ignore it?

Considering just these two things can be very helpful in deciding how to respond.]
;B[ff];W[dm]C[rush : seem like W11, but i see it's "mirrored". so,]
;B[cm]SQ[cn]C[rush : i "mirrored" my move

baudtack: Again probably not attach here. Let W figure out how to strengthen himself or herself. The diagonal move here i've marked may work better. It is called a shoulder hit. It puts presure on W and strengthens any possiblity of corner territory for B. It's one of the holy grails of go, a move with more than one purpose!]
;W[ge]C[rush : i know this's call a peek. so i resond to F16

baudtack: Ok so let's see what happens if you ignore this.]

(;B[fe]LB[fe:A][fq:B];W[mp];B[mq];W[bj];B[ci];W[en]CR[bi][cn]
[lp][np]C[baudtack: W is being crazy here. He or she starts to strengthen a group and then abandons it. B could calmly press home the attack on any of these weak groups. If black want's to strengthen k13 or k14 would be good. That group at k16 is in potential trouble because of that large wall W has.]
;B[bi]C[baudtack: OH! Nice!];W[df];B[de];W[gm];B[gk]C[baudtack: I like the idea here. keep connected, put presure on W. I think g3 would be better though as it starts to secure a bit of territory there. k10 is in no danger of being cut off. Even if W lives there, who cares? The amount of work it will take to make that live shoule make B very happy to take all the rest of the board as profit :-p]
;W[go]C[baudtack: W begins to make eyeshape here...]
(;B[gp]LB[cn:B][gp:A];W[cn]C[baudtack, I would not have ignored this. It makes things a bit too easy for W.]
;B[qm];W[il]C[W is crazy here again. c8 works much better or even c5]
;B[jl];W[in];B[jn]C[rush : so far, i think i just defend only :(

baudtack: yes. W is bullying you and has very very strong shape here now. However don't despair! You are still stronger in most of the board!]

baudtack: It's sort of been the elephant in the room since W formed that large wall. I think it can probably still live though...]
;B[eb];W[aj];B[ai];W[nn];B[np];W[of];B[qh];W[li]C[baudtack: But you should follow up on that bad feeling. Ignoring the problem will not make it better!]

baudtack: You ignored this for way too long and allowed your opponent the first move here, Thankfully, your opponent is clueless and doesn't attack very strongly.]
;B[ib];W[hp];B[hq];W[co];B[ho]C[baudtack: So both of you are ignoring the fight you just started. that upper groups is worth... 20 points or so? Much more than the 1 possibly 3 points you just gained.]
;W[gn];B[an];W[bn];B[lb]C[rush : ready or not, the fight will be take place. --another random placement again :(

baudtack: Ok, so what you need to do here, is figure out, how do i make two eyes.]
;W[am]C[IGNORE THIS! this is worthless! 4 points vs the aformentioned 20! Don't let W draw you off course!]

;W[eh];B[ei]C[rush : ups!! so ambitious until i can't see my 3 stones are in danger.]
;W[gg]C[rush : very disappointed.
hmm so the first thing to learn is not to much ambitious, right? :)

baudtack: In a way yes. It's all about focus. Look around. Why did my opponent just move where they did? Presumably they had a reason. Look around until you find it.]

(;B[cf]LB[cf:B][dg:A]C[baudtack: by this point you've probably learned something about territory vs influence even if you don't understand them. If you did understand them, you'd be dan level. But a basic idea you should ask youself with any move is "what do i want?" Whith the move i've suggested here you would be placing emphasis on the corner territory. With your move at d13, you're placing emphasis on influence on the center. 

I know I said don't attach to stones, but here you are very very very strong so you can get away with it. W has no base from which to form eyes yet and so needs to try to secure that before attacking you.

When playing stronger players, particularly in handicap games, when you see aggressive play it can be intimidating. Try to be calm and ask, "what are they trying to do? Do i need to respond to that?" doing this will greatly help.]
