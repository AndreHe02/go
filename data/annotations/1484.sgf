C[Played at the tournament in Bonn
I am Black (Arend, 1k*/ 3D DE), W is Uwe (3D DE)

klin: B 23 OK.];W[ip];B[go];W[gn];B[ho];W[in]C[Should w just play l4 instead?

klin: Agree.  L4 or M3.];B[hn];W[hm]
(;B[hq]C[Is variation better?

klin: The variation takes cash, but W is thick outside.];W[io]
C[klin: W 34 connect at J7 better.];B[im];W[gm];B[iq];W[ko]

(;B[fn]C[Is this too rude? I didn't like the idea to let W fix this cut in sente (see var)

klin: Yes, W can fix the cut first.];W[em];B[en];W[do];B[fm]

(;B[dl]C[What do u think of the exchange in the variation?

klin: The variation is better, because it is sente and B can M6 attack W.]
;W[er];B[fr];W[ds];B[kr];W[mo];B[no]LB[mq:a]C[Is a bettter (n3)?

klin: B 61 better.];W[mn];B[jk];W[jj];B[kj];W[ji];B[lk];W[ki]
;B[li];W[kl];B[kk];W[lh];B[ik]C[aji-keshi?

klin: B 73 OK.];W[hi];B[om];W[mp];B[lq]LB[mq:a]C[This move yields in very crude shape, but I thought I should try to steal
W's eyeshape. Still, now I like a (n3) better.

klin: n3 better here.  B 77 helps W to make eyes.];W[mq];B[mr]
;W[lp];B[lr];W[nl];B[pj]C[My group in the center is weaker than W's. So I thought my only hope can be to induce W to connect on dame while I get one or 2 moves on the outside.

klin: W is almost alive (with the help of B 77).  However, B can O6 now.  B 73 need not be cut.  After W responds at, say M8, B N11.  B reserves R7.]
;W[nn];B[mi]C[klin: This result is not bad either.];W[pk]C[This surprised me. Maybe W should tenuki?

klin: No, B 73 stone is not completely dead yet.  However, W 86 helps B. P9 better.]
;B[qj];W[oj]LB[ok:a]C[Is a (point below) better shape?

klin: Now W tries to get sente.];B[oi];W[nj];B[ni];W[nc];B[nd]
LB[lc:a]C[Rather a? (m17) In the joseki I chose, I got too overconcentrated.
(I thought of it as building a moyo, but now it rather looks like
the proverbially bad territory between two walls to me.)

klin: B can try J10 and H10 now to see if W wants to save the 5 stones.  If W does, a new fight begins and W moyo will disappear.  If W gives up the 5 stone by playing G11, B plays at J3 and reserve the right for the 5 stones.]

klin: F16.];B[fd];W[ee];B[eb];W[db];B[ed];W[de];B[dc];W[cc]
;B[cb]C[Is there an alternative to start the ko immediately?

klin: Always count the ko threat before start a ko.  B can H16 first.  If W J16, B has created many ko threats.  If W J17, B J16 keeps pressing.]

;W[re]C[klin: W gains huge here.];B[qf]C[klin: B 137 should leave it for now and attack at C14.]
;W[rf];B[rg]LB[qg:a]C[simply a better? (r13)

klin: Yes.];W[qg];B[rh];W[me];B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[cf]C[klin: W gets 146, good for W now.]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[ch];W[dg]C[klin: W 150 not good.  Should then B15]

The count shows:
B:
Lower Side = 11, UR = 20, Left Side = 37
W:
LL = 9, Upper Side = 36, LR = 21
B has 68 + Sente, W hast 66 + Komi.

(Unless B can play the B a - W b  - B c W d in sente, which I doubt,
as W will play ko.) (h16--j16-g17-j15)

So W has won.])
