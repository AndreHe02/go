You may want to consider a move around R8. This would prevent your group from coming under attack.

Or if you're looking to start applying pressure at this point, you could also consider a play at C8.]
;B[qk]C[folmez: The three white stones on the right side seemed weak and I felt the need to strengthen them. A jump at P14 may have worked better but I am not sure. Even with my jump at P11, the outcome of black peep upset me.

What do you think? Strengthen now or play somewhere else at bigger points?]

(;W[mh]MA[mi][ni][nj][mj]C[My plan is to have a solid wall and to let him live.

J: This move looks odd. It appears that you are trying to prevent a cut at both O11 and O13 with ladders. 
It is very possible that later play will make the ladder favorable for black and you could have a problem.

The only cut you need to be concerned with is O11. Any of the marked points prevent the cut without the need to worry about future plays in the lower left.

If black chooses to cut at O13, you can happily take outside influence by playing at N13.

More important than the cut, however, is developing from your wall. Q9 feels like the real move (honte) here. But you may also want to consider a move at R6 or R7.]
;B[qe];W[nb]C[J: This move doesn't put any pressure on black. Your focus should be on the lower left.]
;B[pk];W[oc];B[od];W[pn]C[Is this a good way to attack the two black stones at R9? Should I be attacking?

J: I would prefer an approach at O3 myself. Black requires an additional move at S9 to close off his territory.
The lower side also has more potential for you to gain territory. This move seems too aggressive considering your neighboring O12 group is not settled.]

;B[rk];W[si];B[rh];W[op]C[I did this because I thought black would have tried to connect the four black stone with the corner and then I would have gained influence towards my white stone at the other corner.

(;W[rm]C[He didn't want to connect to corner so I kept attacking.

J: You're too eager.

Black can connect to the corner, but its more valuable to play on the outside. 

You're groups at O12 and P4 are both fairly weak. You are forcing black to seperate these groups. The ensuing fight will be difficult.

I would consider a play at either N8 or M4 to fix your weakness first.]

J: It certainly feels like an overplay. Its hard for you to punish, since your stones to the right are not settled.]
(;W[jb]C[J: You're trying to prevent him from getting a base for his stone.
It would be better to limit his ability to run away, since there isn't enough room on the edge to get eyes.

If black were to jump out here, you could connect underneath for several points, but you'd have trouble pressuring black's stones.]

(;W[ge]C[J: The attack here is very difficult due to your weaknesses.

You could try pushing at J13 instead. This would help fix your weakness, and it prevents the K9 black group from becoming settled.]

J: The cut is dangerous, but Black's 3 stones here are not settled and it is dangerous for him to fight here.

Instead, consider a play at D6, which would gain territory and put pressure on these 3 stones.]

(;W[en]C[J: This move leaves a  serious weakness.

Its better to consider D6 or E5 to make a stronger connection. You should be able to either damage black's left side or take the bottom.]

;B[gm];W[el];B[im];W[ci]C[I think I have gone the wrong side. I wanted to complicate things but when black separated this white stone, I didn't see any other way than to sacrifice it. In the end I sacrificed it for the top. Black may have gained more from this exchange.

J: Compare this position to 10 moves from now. You have many choices to reduce black's territory from the center. You lose all these options after this invasion. 

You did gain on the top, but the game is close enough that this is an unnessesary risk.]

This sequence of moves costs you several points, since it allows black to fix weaknesses while you gain nothing.]

J: Invasions were a common theme in this game.

Your opponent made several invasions that left him with weak stones. When faced with invading stones, your first instinct was usually to play towards the edge down to the 2nd line.

Next time, watch for your other options with surrounding stones. If your opponent doesn't have enough room to make eyes along the edge, then focus on his options for running out. You may not be able to kill his stones, but you can frequently find ways to gain points while chasing weak groups.

Finally, take a few moments when you are nearing the endgame to count out territories. This will help you determine whether you need to invade or reduce. 
If you had played a simple reducing move instead of your invasion at C11, I think you would have had a clear path to victory.

Thanks for submitting this game and I hope you found my comments helpful.
