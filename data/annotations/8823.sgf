C[Hi.

I'm Honza, playing black in this game.
Its from a recent tournament, so a serious game (60mins+byoyomi).
We're both EGD 5k.

I really apreciate the effort you put in to review and ill do my best to remember something useful from it! :)
And also im not a native speaker, so forgive me the mistakes here and there :P

WOG: Hi!

Thanks for submitting this game!  I will make my comments with WOG:

General things you can learn from this game:

- Never too late to go back and fix a mistake
- Try not to guess or just do something because you saw it somewhere... have a reason

Your game is pretty solid.  You definitely seemed stronger than your opponent, but without the full game, we only got into a little of the deep middle game.  It's a shame.  I think you're stronger in the early middle game, so not finding your deeper faults.

Good luck!  Good Go!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[dd]
C[I dont really know this joseki, but tournament are a place to learn new things, right? :)

WOG: IMHO, I prefer to not try to learn things at tournament games.  I prefer to experiment outside and use what I know in tournament games.   May be that the opponent knows a joseki better than I do and I can't conjure hundreds of years of trial and error on the spot.  This isn't a complaint, btw.  Perfectly fine to experiment, even in a tournament game.  One of my favorite players did it quite successfully - Cho Chikun.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[df]C[WOG: Many variations in this branch...]
;B[cc];W[db];B[bc];W[eb]C[WOG: All normal up to here];B[fc]
C[Now i believe this is playable for b if he has a ladder working. Then black should come out better. Correct me if im wrong.

WOG: The ladder is against Black if Black cuts at c14... I'm not sure of the other ladder you speak of]
(;W[bb]C[WOG: This is a change from the normal joseki.  Normally, White plays at B16 or some of the other variations I show]
;B[cf]C[WOG: Yes, this is an out of order variation on the joseki]
;W[bf];B[cg];W[bd];B[ad]C[WOG: In the joseki as well, Black has an opportunity to atari and doesn't.  My thought is that it's aji keshi, therefore.]
;W[be];B[bg]
(;W[cb]C[WOG: This isn't the only way for White to play];B[ef]
C[And somehow we finished it off xD - i like this for b.

WOG: Right, perhaps because White varied from the joseki with B18.  Normally, White has split Black somewhat or at least left more aji.  Black's a bit ahead now.  Experiment worked ;^)]
;W[cl]C[WOG: This is sort of chuuto hanpa - lukewarm, an in-between move.  Doesn't do much good for the corner, still makes a decent extension on the side.  A bleh move.  Another tiny victory for Black]
;B[pj]C[WOG: Black is doing well.  Could also consider removing the ladder aji now.]
;W[nq]C[WOG: Ladder breaker];B[pn]C[WOG: Oops.  Now White can pull out the stone.  Ruins the entire upper left.]
(;W[nc]C[WOG: Why isn't White pulling out that stone?]
(;B[dg]C[This was a funny moment xD
I realised that after O3 was played, w could draw out his stone since the ladder now works.
Not sure if it was really needed though... is taking now too slow?

WOG: LOL!  Great!  You got to it first!

No, taking is not too slow.  Your position up top would be completely ruined.  Now it's a fortress!]
;W[pr]C[WOG: Of the White stones, this is not the area where White is weakest.  I'd play up above]
(;B[qq]C[WOG: You can attack the stone up top instead];W[kq]
;B[fq]C[I decided the lower side was biggest. Is this the correct direction?

WOG: You have a mighty fortress in the top left.  You tenuki'd in the top right... I think the right move is to play against the top right White stone.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[hq]C[WOG: Too close to Black's stones];B[do]
C[WOG: The usual move is here, but with the placement of c8, not as sure...]
;W[co];B[cq]TR[hq]C[I think i saw this somewhere. So i gave it a try.

WOG: I like that you experiment in Go.  That's a good way to learn.  Can't say I recommend just following moves you think you saw somewhere, but... hey, if you're trying it out.   This variation has a lot to learn from]
(;W[eo]C[WOG: Ugh.  This move does nothing for White]
(;B[er]C[WOG: Hopefully you explored pulling the atari'd stone out?]
;W[dr]C[WOG: Yup];B[dq]C[WOG: Usually, atari-ing is bad...]
;W[ep]C[Now i cant really protect both :(

WOG: Right.  You fixed the opponent by atari-ing];B[cr]C[WOG: Hmmm.  Black was ahead but now is taking a small corner.  Strategically, it'd be better to use your fortress above.]
;W[fr];B[ds]C[WOG: Rather small.  And now White has shifted the balance of power on the board]
;W[gr]C[Isnt w too good? Or is this a succes for b?];B[bo];W[dn]
;B[bn]C[WOG: Small again, but does raise the cut];W[qc]C[WOG: With the change in the balance of power, now crazy things are possible... like this.]
(;B[pc]SQ[gb]C[I played too fast, there was only "separate the stones" in my mind.
But i think this is the wrong direction after all..

WOG: Yes, the backdoor is open on the side.  Yes, there's potential for territory between blocking on the other side.  This way raises the spectre of the aji of cutting off the White stone at c8.  The other way not as much.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[qb]C[Surprised me.

WOG: Pleasantly?]
(;B[pb]C[WOG: Doh!  I thought you'd play to block now!  Even better if you thought this was the wrong direction!

Still playable, of course];W[qf];B[pf]C[WOG: Getting to be a little bit slow...]
;W[qg];B[pg]C[WOG: Wow, very slow.  Steady and very strong, but slow.]
;W[gb]C[WOG: And, the obvious weakness.  Still, sort of end game-y for me,  but if Lee Chang Ho can do it...]
(;B[qh]C[WOG: OK, now you've gone too far.  You make a wall, you need an extension]
;W[el]C[WOG: The ladder was still working for White?];B[qe]
;W[re]C[Looks like destroying aji.. i dont know what i saw there :/

WOG: Right.  What's the good next here?  Sure, you can play s12 and be more stylish, or, you can EXTEND FROM YOUR WALL!

See in variation a more stylish idea for a probe]
(;B[jn]LB[mn:A]C[I thought this was stylish, with A in mind. But maybe stylish is not always the best criteria to decide where to play xD

WOG: Yes, stylish is overrated.  You can probe first.];W[hd]
C[WOG: Seriously?  This can be cut... dangerous for White]
(;B[kd]C[WOG: Lower is better, but this works too];W[mn]
(;B[jp]C[WOG: Why not raise the issue up top?];W[jq];B[mo];W[no]
;B[nn]C[Didnt really read this, but it might work somehow :)

WOG: Seems like you do a lot of guessing!  In a serious game, try to read!]

(;B[po]C[WOG:  Aaaaiiiigggghhh!  Cut!];W[op];B[ln]C[WOG: Double atari is pointless in comparison to cutting]

[on][oo]C[I was thinking w had something more dangerous to play here, i was glad i got out ouf the cross-cut this nicely.
Anyway, thats how far i remembered the game :P

Later on i got to play A which makes cutting at B work. I waited until the time was right, then cut - i surprised Tonda.
After struggling a little, his triangle group died though and he had to resign.

Thanks a lot for the review!

Honza

WOG: Thanks for sending in the game!  Surprised that Tonda missed A!]
