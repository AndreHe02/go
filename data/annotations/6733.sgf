C[Hi Mr. Reviewer!
This is a game which I played White. In some parts, I didn't know where I should have played.
 Can you recommend me some books so I can study harder? I got lots of Go books and problems here, but I don't which I sould read first. (Books like Tesuji, Chuban, Tsumego, Killer of Go, or any other book).  Also, which Go problems I should study more?

Thank you.

PM:  You've correclty guessed my gender.  Be careful, you won't always be so lucky!

I'm personally a fan of goproblems.com, as well as the Go Teaching Ladder service we both use.  The Elementary Go Series was extremely helpful to me, I suggest you find a book that works for you and then apply the patterns to an actual goban rather than just staring at the book.  Download some SGFs of pro games and play them out on a physical board as well.  

We make a lot of similar mistakes in our openings, you and I.  Some good advice that was given to me recently is to not play too lightly in the opening, and to try to ensure that all groups have solid bases from which to launch attacks.  

You might find the fuseki problems on goproblems.com useful, and I think studying up on joseki would do you some good.  Not so that you memorize all the sequences, but rather to get a feel for what an "even result" looks like.

You lost by a small amount of points, there were many points in the game where a slightly different choice would have made up the point difference.  

I hope you find the variations useful, feel free to drop me a line with any questions or for a game!  I'm PMurphy on KGS.]

(;W[od]C[PM:  Why the high approach?  What was your plan?];B[oc]
;W[nc];B[pc]
(;W[md]C[PM:  This is one of those situations where Joseki comes in handy.  The Tiger's mouth shape seems good, but there are advantages to connecting solidly at O16 instead.  Please see variation.]
;B[jc];W[qf]C[In this part, after Black played at K17, I thought this should prevent Black from getting more territory and give me more influence.

PM:  This was a good thought, but you had to be mindfull of the cut at Q15.  I would prefer Q14.]
;B[pf]
(;W[pg]C[PM:  I think the other hane would have worked better.  Remember:  Cut apart your opponant while connecting yourself.  Don't do one at a time.]
;B[pe];W[qh]TR[nc][md][od][qf][pg]C[PM:  Notice now that you have two weak groups, while black is relatively secure in the corner.]
;B[rf];W[pl]C[PM.  Good idea and nicely executed, however the fact that you're trying to strengthen one of two weak groups gives black additional tempo to begin an assault elsewhere.]
;B[jq]
(;W[gq]C[PM:  Don't always think in terms of attacking the "invading" stone.  With this much area open there's no such thing as an "invasion".  You know black will run either right or left, plan your answer based on what will profit you the most.  3-point extension on the third line lives, usually.]
;B[mq]
(;W[po]TR[cm][cn][dn][co]C[PM:  Taking the "double wing" is higher priority here, I think]
;B[cq]C[After Black's move I didn't know if I should have played at C4 or D3

PM: I think you handled this well enough.  "Block on the wider side", they say.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr]
(;W[gr]C[PM: Wrong direction.  Let black crawl along the second line all they want.  The wall you get in return is worth much more than the small territory gained.]
;B[cr]C[PM:  Thank-you move by black.  Empty triangle = very bad]

(;W[bp]C[PM:  Too passive, see variation];B[bq];W[ck];B[ce]
C[PM:  Letting black get this enclosure was huge.  You had a few opprotunities to take this point yourself.  The trick is identifying which moves you can safely ignore.]

(;W[og]C[I was trying to extend towards the center but I was insecure about making a one-point space jump or a keima.

PM:  Far too small.  If you want to connect your two weak tiger's mouths, O14 seems like the logical place.  There are bigger points on the board, though.]
;B[ne];W[nd];B[oe];W[me];B[ng];W[je]C[Was this Boshi an unecessary move?

PM:  Your O16 group has become very heavy.  I think black used this to his advantage to strengthen their moyo.]
;B[ge]C[PM:  Black's northwestern corner looks terrifying now, but maybe there's a way?]

(;W[ej];B[in];W[gn];B[hl];W[fl]C[Were these moves a too passive? Black had already taken 3 corners, so I guess I was a bit desperate to compensate that loss.

PM: I would probably play the same, from this position you can strangle blacks southern group with a press from the east, as well as blacks northwestern group with a press from the south.  This is also probably the only way you're going to save the weak white northern group.]
;B[bk];W[bl];B[bj]
(;W[mo]TR[ng]C[I made this move trying to extend some influence from the territory on the right, but I was worried about the marked stone invading it.

PM:  Here's where it get's tricky.  I think the large knight's move to D13 might have been a bit too far.  See variations.]
;B[ei]C[After B103, preventing the connection at D11 or stopping Black from going towards the center at F11 would have been better. I was afraid of being cut and Black continuing advancing if I made a Hane at F11.......]
;W[fj]C[....so I connected.];B[fi];W[fd]C[PM:  You've made yet another weak group for yourself.  Defending it will give tempo to black]

(;W[pm]C[PM:  Wrong direction.  Drive black towards your strength, not open territory.  You have plenty of chances to connect.  See variations.]
;B[qn];W[qo];B[rn];W[ro];B[om]C[And Black started destroying White's territory. What was more important: saving the white stones or the corner and side?

Thank you for the attention.

PM:  There were a lot of little blunders, as is usually the case.  Difficult at my level of skill to pick out one crucial point, as there were many situations that would have resulted in 7 points difference for either side.  White had opprotunities to win as late in the game as move 260.]
