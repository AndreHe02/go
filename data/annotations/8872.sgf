C[I won at the end, but I would like to learn much from this game.  I would be gratefull if you commented both players.

# I'm happy to review this game. I will concentrate on general principles.
If you have further questions please contact me.

Best regards,
Felix];B[pd]C[Rodrick [19k\]: you too];W[cp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd]
C[# Good, San-ren-sei-opening (Three star points).];W[jq]LB[ip:B]
[iq:A]C[# This move is ok. There is a well known class of openings, called the Chinese opening, which looks similar. For the Chinese opening Rodrick should have played A (low Chinese) or B (high Chinese). This is just for information, because at your level I would say it makes not much difference if you play A, B or the actual game move.]
;B[pm]LB[dj:B][pj:D][dm:A][ep:C]C[Q: Is this move a bit greedy? It might be too far from the black base.

# This move is ok. Personally I would prefer A, because if White plays a pincer around B I can follow up on C. If White pincers on D, there is no such good follow up move on the right side. But this is not so important at your level.]
;W[ro]LB[np:A]TR[qn][qo][kq][lq][mq][nq][oq]C[# It's right to defend the corner. But White should do so in the bigger area. I would prefer A, because there is more territory. You can simply count the empty lines: five lines in the A area, but only two lines between the corner and the black stone.]
;B[qj]LB[dj:B][eq:A]C[After the I felt iit was not the best move. R11 could have been better...

# Yes, R11 is a bit better compared to your actual game move. Another idea would be to ignore the move at all and play A or B instead.]
;W[on]LB[dj:C][om:A][eq:B]C[This move is a bit strange. Give sblack a good wall....

# There is a proverb: "Pushing from behind is bad." So pushing at A is not good.
It seems that you get a nice wall, but White gets a wall as well.
I would prefer B or C.];B[om]C[# Black is pushing from behind...]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mm]TR[nn][on][lp][mp][np][kq][lq][mq][nq][oq]
C[# White is building territory at the bottom.];B[cm]LB[dj:C]
[dm:A][ep:B]C[Black is switching side to restrict white's options.

Q: Is this not leaving to big gap for white invasion? Seems at the moment too agressive.

# Personally I would prefer the high approach at A, but the idea is similar: White either defends the corner at B, then Black follows up at C.
Or if White invades around C, Black has good follow up around B.
In conclusion: The move is fine, nothing aggressive about it.]
;W[dn]C[# Good move.];B[dl];W[fn];B[fl]LB[cg:B][dh:A]C[# I would prefer A or B, because it makes an invasion on the left much more difficult for White.
Right now White only played in the bottom area. Black's area of influence is much bigger.]
;W[dh]C[# Usually an invasion at the 3rd line is better, because the group is much easier to settle.]
;B[cf]C[Black wants to secure the corner.

# Black's move shows, why 3rd line would have been better. White has no base.]
;W[dj];B[fj]LB[gk:A]C[# Good move. To avoid the peep and cut, Black could have played A, but it puts also less pressure on White.]
;W[ek];B[el];W[fk]
(;B[gl]LB[ci:B][gk:A]C[# This move is a common mistake among double digit kyus I guess. Black has to block at A. Even if White can cut. There is a lot of aji around B, so Black should be fine.]
;W[gk];B[hl];W[jl];B[gn]LB[hk:A]C[A tricky contact move.

Q: What about H6? It seems to be better.

# I think this contact play and H6 make no big difference. But I would prefer A overall. It tries to connect to the top and keeps the white group weak.]

;W[fi];B[ff]LB[jm:A]TR[fj]C[I guess this was too high, leaves a good option for white on the upper side.

# After White has captured the marked black stone, the group is settled and alive. Black should exploit the weaknesses in White's formation starting with A.]
;W[hh]LB[nc:A][qf:B][jo:C]C[# This is a rather small move for White because the group is already alive. I would recommend A, B or C. Those moves are much bigger in terms of territory.]
;B[ii]LB[jm:A]C[# I think it is better to start at A. Black will break in the bottom area and reduce White there.]
;W[hi];B[ij]LB[jj:A]C[# Better shape at A.];W[ll]LB[nc:A][qf:B]
C[# Small move again. Look at the board. Where is a lot of empty space? A or B are biggest moves now for both players.]
;B[nk]LB[nc:B][nd:A]C[# Now Black could have made the big move in the top right corner: A or B.]
;W[kj];B[kh];W[mi];B[mh]LB[mg:A]C[# Sometimes contact play is not good, because it strengthens your opponent. A would be a local alternative.]
;W[ni]LB[nc:A][ph:B]C[# Instead of this move playing at A is much bigger for White. Black should answer at B now to avoid White's shoulder hit.]
;B[nh];W[pi]C[This move surprised me during the game played.

# Yes, good move for White.];B[qi];W[oh]LB[pg:A]C[# A is the best defense move for Black. It connects the black stones and protects the side. The side is bigger than the center.]
;B[og];W[pg];B[of];W[qh];B[rh];W[qg]LB[rg:A]C[# White can and should play A directly.]
;B[qe];W[rg];B[sh];W[sg];B[rj]C[This was important....];W[rf]

[io:A]C[# White is already connected and Black is alive, so this move is very small because you gain only a couple of points. Protecting at A or invading at B are much bigger. Just compare the size of these areas.]

;B[ji]LB[bg:A][rn:B]TR[kg]C[# This moves safes only one point. As I said before, both groups are alive so connecting has not much value. A or B are both worth more than 5 points.]

C[# Here is a basic principle for how to kill a group:
Do not play contact moves. That helps your opponent to strengthen himself. You should reduce the potential space to live for the group instead.
A or B for example are much better.];B[nd]C[# Now White gets a free move at O17.]
;W[nc];B[od];W[lc];B[me]LB[kb:B][ob:A]C[# Again, reducing the space to life is much more important. It is all about eyes. A or B are better.]
