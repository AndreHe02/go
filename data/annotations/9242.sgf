C[Hello, macac014 :)

First of all, congratulations on your win here! I've tried my best to review the interesting points in the game, providing feedback, exaplanations and variations where applicable. You will find the comments on relevant nodes along on the original branch and on variations' branches, where it's needed to elaborate further on the shown play. In addition - your questions were answered on the nodes they were asked on.

As requested, the review was done for the white side, but here and there are a few comments for the black - for you to pay attention in future games and to know what black could have done better in this game.

Enjoy, and have a great time playing in the future! 

Following is a general summary of the game, your play as seen in this game and a few pointers for the future:

During the game you've shown that you have a cool head, and play solidly with a good sense of direction. Trust your instincts in that regard - some of the moves were quite advanced :)

There are a number of areas you need to pay attention to when playing:
1. Always keep in mind the big picture when you are playing - what big points are left yet (prefer taking those first)? what side should you defend and attack in view of the whole board (maybe one direction will help you more then other)? can you leave the fight to start playing in another area or is it not finished yet (or are there still urgent things to do - to defend or to attack)?
2. Fighting is often tit-for-tat but that doesn't mean that you need to passively answer you opponent or respond immediately and tightly to his attack. It's much better and easier to fight when you give yourself some breathing space while attacking - extensions, knight's moves and nets instead of constant contact-play. Keep in mind that it is _you_ who needs to direct the flow of the fight and not the opponent.
3. You have a tendency to play higher than needed (playing on 4th line when 3rd would be preferable). 4th line is mainly for influence (it can serve as an invitation to attack from below or gain territory if it has support nearby), while 3rd line is mainly for territory (and also easier to settle and stay alive there, since it's harder to cut you from beneath).
4. Try to avoid small moves - moves that don't give you much (or at all). The better moves are those that give you some kind of profit (territory/help to defend/help to attack). Usually - empty triangles are such small moves :) In addition, try to avoid playing small moves that are aji-keshi - they neither give you profit nor allow for interesting possibilities later on.
5. Your reading seems to be just fine, but one thing you seem to be overlooking, especially while in the middle of the fight, is the double-threats. I'd advise you to choose one (or both) of the possible methods of dealing with it - trying to read possibilities for double threats (thus avoiding them) or prefer extensions instead of diagonal plays (which provide cutting points - dangerous when fighing in great proximity).

During the game, the most troublesome moves were the moves at:
O4 - this move lacked direction and caused much trouble in the bottom-right
G12 - reducing this liberty instead of the other gave black the opening he needed to break free
J15 - wasted move that gave black the initiative he needed to reduce your territory in top-right
Pay special attention to those moves and the explanations provided.

And that's about it :) Once again - good job, and if you have any questions, you're more than welcome to email me.

Best regards,

(;W[cd]C[This response is unfavorable usually, and supposed to be chosen when you have a supporting stone on C11 (shown in a branch).

The better responses are shown in variations.]
(;B[de]
(;W[fc]C[This stone is too low - it's ok to be a bit bolder and move one stone higher (F16). There is no way for you to be cut - shown in variation.]

(;B[dd]C[This is the wrong direction for black - as black has shown all over the game, he's being too aggressive. Remember: before you attack, you must secure you're base - urgent things first. In this situation black should have played somewhere in the area of C11.

In the variation I show 2 possible ways of punishing black for being over-agressive - despite what you "lose" in the corner, you gain much more on the left side in compensation.]

(;W[cc]C[Too passive - there is a good way to punish black: rob him off his base. See variations.]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[ad]
(;W[ac]C[I can't say that this solid block is bad, per se, but it is "boring" :) In a more traditional terms, I'd call it aji-keshi - "potential-destroying move". When black protects the possible cut (as he almost always does), there is nothing interesting to be done with this fight. Were you to play something like B14, you'd be able to use black's cutting point to your advantage and secure a base in his territory while attacking him.

Note: B14 doesn't have to be played right now - you can play elsewhere at this stage and keep it for later when the larger picture is clearer and you can decide on a proper direction to fight.

An example of play is shown in variation. See how the wall black is trying to create is pushed back, while you take the current black wall and strengthening your position.]
;B[bf]
(;W[fp]C[Your question here: is this the right side?

Well, that's actually a hard question - maybe some top pro can say for sure... :) Basically it's just too soon to say in the game - in both directions you are interrupting black's intial claim, in both direction you are far from black strength, in both directions you can live/go for some other goal.

However, in this particular situation - there are much bigger points on the board to take, and would be better doing that before approaching this corner. In addition, after the big points are taken - it's possible that the proper direction here will be more apparent.

See variations for possible bigger moves.

In addition, in this particular direction - i'd prefer F3 instead of F4 (shown in variation). Easier to live if black playes well. :)]
;B[dn]
(;W[ip]C[Your question was: k4 is better?

Absolutely NOT. Your play here was the right distance. Check variation why.]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[jp]
(;W[pn]C[Too early, in my opinion. The J4-K4 is not over yet - first reach some accomodation there, and then continue to the next fight.

See a possible variation.

In addition, even when approaching here, I would advise coming one stone lower at R6, which would allow you to slide into the corner. See a variation for that.]
;B[po]C[Unclear what this move meant to achieve for black... Except showing his aggressiveness. Would be _much_ better at N4 or N3 or R5.]

(;W[np]C[This move defies two basic ideas - don't play near to black's strength and don't create weak groups (weak being unconnected and threatened).

Unless you can completely shut black in (and that's not possible here - too much space for him to escape), it's better to attack by destroying black base - trying to cut under.

See variation of better plays here.

And another variation if you are very lucky :P];B[no]C[This move by black is expected.]

(;W[oo]C[Again - playing into black's strength. There is no way you can get profit here unless black blunders horribly.

Better to try and escape here - see variations.];B[op];W[on]
;B[mp];W[nq];B[mo]
(;W[lq]C[This move would better be one line lower - at M2. Would be easier on you - see variation (just a couple of possible plays, the branching is big).]
;B[mq];W[mr]C[Your question was: this move is wrong?

In this particular situation, this play is ok - threatening to connect and steal the corner. Impossible, if black plays properly, but worth threatening.

However, itt's not this move in particular that's bad or not - it's the whole play in this area. I have described earlier what you should have done in this area.]
;B[nr]C[Expected by black.];W[lr]C[Good!]
(;B[oq]C[Unneeded for black. You weren't threatening black here at the moment and he had bigger moves.

Variations show hhow black can defend in case you continue.]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[kq]C[Good job on connecting - proper way to move in this situation.]

(;B[lp]C[This move is very small (also forming an empty triangle). Black should have played as in variation, for example.]

(;W[pj]C[Right notion, but not the right time to tenuki - better support the P6 by playing R5, and then support it.]
;B[qn]C[And now black have taken the opportunity and forced you to defend.]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[rm];B[nm]
(;W[dl]C[This stone would be better played at C8 - since black is fairly strong in the area, you need either to secure your base and live there (and playing on the 3rd line makes it easier) or attack and escape (and here you can attack deeper).

See variations.];B[pm]C[Black had to play this after O7.];W[om]

;B[mk];W[oi];B[nn]
(;W[fm]C[You asked here: should i extend the left side first?

Well, overall - yes, it would be better, sinc you attack black here from above without anything to gain for:
1. You cannot kill the corner - too much space for black
2. You cannot take territory in the center - your "wall" is nullified by black's wall on the right
3. The bottom group doesn't need saving - it stands on its own so no need to try connecting to it
4. You don't threaten black's left side any more than D8 already does

There is a fairly standard trick to play in sente (on your initiative) here - attack at C7 and see which side black defends, and then attack the other. See explanation in variation.

However... All the above is nice and all, but before you play here, better nullify the bad aji you've left in the bottom-right corner by playing at S3. Black will have to defend (otherwise you take his corner), and then you can continue here.]
;B[rp]C[This is the bad aji I've mentioned...];W[sn];B[qp]
(;W[sj]C[This move is unnecessary - black cannot escape. Better play on the left.

If you want to be bad, you can play T2 :)];B[sq];W[so];B[mj]
;W[rq];B[ni]
(;W[oj]C[No need to connect - black cannot cut you. Better to use this wasted move by black and play somewhere else, like on left or R2 or O12]
;B[qq]
(;W[sr]C[Better to play this at S2 - hurt black more.];B[rr]
;W[sq];B[rs];W[dh]C[You asked here: d11 is better?

First of all - good to turn to other direction now. The fight in the right is decided, no need to play pointless moves.

The answer to your question was given earler, when you asked whether it's better to extend before playing F7. To reiterate here - it's better to play C7 first and then either C11 or B5.

Another note: playing like this is inviting black to strike at D10 - splitting you right in the middle between two areas where he is strong.]

(;B[dg]C[Black once again shows his over-agressiveness: there is no need to push against your stone.

Much better would be to play F15 or C11. See variations.]
(;W[fg]C[Unfortunately, you didn't take the opportunity to settle a base on the left and to deny black territory there.

Check a possible variation.];B[ch];W[ci];B[di];W[eh];B[cj];W[bi]
