;W[pp];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[cf];B[jd]C[depends on personal preference, i guess. But i'd prefer K17to maintain a high-low balance between that stone and the R16 stone.

K16 makes a white invasion at O17 particularly painful.];W[od]
;B[oc]C[N17 might have been better as it covers the weakness of the K16 stone]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[qf];W[jb]C[White's move at K18 seems a little odd

might be a little too far for comfort, though its playable, since your K16 group isnt terribly strong either.]
;B[ic]C[I wasn't happy with my response here...

a counter attack around M17 might have been better. this is too mild]
;W[kc]C[this makes good shape for white, and black's territory is reduced quite badly]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[qq]C[I've never been too confident with handling the pincer, so I just jumped into the corner.

jumping in is usually correct. and its the easiest to do. so why not? =)]

;B[ps]C[White's move at N2 and the sequence that follows seems much more profitable for black. At this point I was happy with the way the game was progressing.

its still kinda hard to tell, but the actual joseki yields more profit for black]
;W[nm];B[kq]C[Too passive again?

its a big move. now half the bottom is black's.];W[eq];B[ep]
C[Is some sort of pincer better? I wanted to push white toward my strength but the end result wasn't great.

i'd prefer G3, but i'm not too sure of the outcome];W[fq];B[fp]
C[i'd play D3 to get the corner, since white can't get much at the bottom anyway, with the L3 stone blocking the way]
;W[cr];B[dq];W[dr];B[gq];W[gr];B[fr];W[er];B[hr];W[fs];B[hq]
C[At the time I was happy with the sequence at the bottom, but it ends in gote for black and white is then able to reduce black's influence.

you have 2 sides of thickness facing each other (H3 and L3), which is inefficient.]
;W[dj]C[ouch.];B[ff]C[D8 is probably better but it seemed too over concentrated

C8 or D8 is very big. if white plays D5 and then pulls back, the black thickness will be for nought.]

;W[kg]C[I wasn't really happy with the sequence starting at F10, but I wanted to try and reduce white's left side a little.

actually, the game's lost by now, so instead of reducing, you might as well invade and try your luck =)]

Result: W+7.5

when it comes to direction, try to get your stones working with one another. if u have a weak stone at the top right corner, and the opponent just attacked your top left corner from the top, pincer him! this attacks his attacking stone and helps the weak stone as well. Influence wise, try to avoid the situation at the bottom. you had 2 strong thickness facing each other, but all it took was some reduction moves and look at the territory's pathetic size lol. the "overconcentrated" D8 move was the biggest move on the board at that time (it was definitely bigger than R11, at any rate), so you didn't really have a choice not to play it.

as for sente, well, i dont know what to say. just make it count. play urgent moves first, then big moves, or if you really dont know what to do, take the biggest point u can find, maybe an empty star point, or reinforce your corner, or play at the intersection between his and your moyo (which expands yours and reduces his)

thats about all. bye and good luck!])
