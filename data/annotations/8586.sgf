AB[cc][gc][cg]C[Since I keep seeing suggestions that game analysis helps you improve your game, I decided to give it a try.  This game is against Igowin Pro set to 18 kyu. (White) I will notate what I was thinking with each of my moves, and during the computers moves I will try to guess their point as well.]
;W[ff]C[White stakes claim to the bottom right corner.
------------
Something like that, but let me get you into the mindset of white. Three stones is quite the advantage to overcome on a 9x9 board. White is going to be looking for a kill to make it happen. If white just wanted territory, he'd play a safer g3. But he's going to try and use this stone to support a later attack, so he played it more towards the middle.]
;B[ce]C[I try to claim the left hand side fully and build a strong base there.]
;W[ec]C[White tries to split the top side and isolate my stone in the top right. I wonder if his stones are a bit too far seperated for this move.
--------------
That depends on your reaction. If you think his stones are too separated, respond with E6 and make the cut.]
(;B[eb]C[I decide to try to cut under to keep my stones connected, quite often I try E6, but I always seem to become split and white is able to easier make territory beneath me.
-----------
Since you play E8, white seems to have judged correctly. 

Let's talk about E6 some more. You say you worry that white will live underneath you, and surely he will if you play e6. But the end result is that you would have a strong wall on the top side. Now you could attack below.]
;W[db]C[Continues to attack the stone at E8 and cut off the top right corner.]
;B[dc]C[I try to solidly cut whites stones at the top apart and attack the d8 stone hoping to give myself the chance to connect.]
;W[fc]C[White attaches to the G7 stone preparing to seperate it off from the group and begins to worry my E8 Stone.]
;B[fb]C[I try to gain a few liberties for the E8 stone and try to connect over to G7.]
;W[gd]C[I didn't quite understand it at the time, but this move protected the cut at F6 very well due to the placement of the F4 stone.]
;B[fd]C[I try to cut off the stones at E7-F7, Probably would have been better to protect the cutting point at G8, by playing perhaps a tigers mouth at H8.]
;W[ed]C[White closes the trap on the F6 stone, I still don't quite see it.]
;B[fe]C[I attempt to extend out of the atari still thinking I can capture the E7 Group.]
;W[ee]C[Cuts the F6 Stones off from the rest of my stones and puts them in a ladder situation.]
;B[dd]C[I finally realize those stones are lost and decide it would be more useful to shore up my defenses on the left side, I wonder if it would have been better to play this move at D5 for a bamboo joint instead of creating the empty triangle shape. That probably would have helped out that C3 stone for chance at expansion along the bottom.
--------------
Good, you saw your mistake, and are moving on. Actually, I feel like both D6 and D5 don't accomplish much. Your stones are already well connected. You might consider something like H6 to secure the top right.]
;W[ge]C[White captures the hung stones and starts making territory on the right side. Seems this capture also makes an easy eye shape.]
;B[gb]C[I want to protect the cut at G8, but maybe H8 would have been better to expand the top right corner.]
;W[hd]C[White starts to block my group up into the right top corner.]
;B[hc]C[I want to make sure I don't lose any territory in the top corner,
----------
But how much are you really defending here? Looks like at best a couple points. Try a move like E3, it will build you some territory below, and keep white in check .]
;W[ga]C[Not sure what white was thinking here, perhaps trying to take away possibility of making eyes. Which worries me enough to want to finish connecting to the stones on the right side.
--------------
This move is pure nonsense. But the computer will sometimes pull stunts like this when it realizes it can't win.]
;B[da]C[I attack the D8 Stone.];W[cb]C[White tries to extend out, I think it would have been better just to lose the stone.]
;B[bb]C[I continue the attack sealing the C8 group in.];W[id]
C[Finishes sealing off the top corner and making territory on the right.]
;B[ic]C[I protect the top right corner.
----------
Once again, try and take the initiative and play on the bottom. Don't passively follow every move white makes.]
;W[eg]C[White moves to seal off the bottom right corner.];B[dh]
C[I wanted to threaten slipping under and into the corner or take more of the bottom.]
;W[eh]C[White keeps me from cutting under.];B[di]C[I try to solidfy the bottom corner and force him to block me from drifting in at E1.]
;W[ei]C[Blocks me out.];B[df]C[I'm thinking a could have a saved a stone or two if I would have made that bamboo joint earlier. I try to push in a little bit to give myself a little bit more territory on the right.]
;W[dg]C[Into the tiger's mouth, really worries me that it will cut off the D1 stones.]
;B[ch]C[I protect the cut as solidly as I can.];W[bf]C[Threatens to cut into C4.]
;B[cf]C[I connect solidly as I can.];W[de]C[Could cause problems to the D6 group which isn't solidly connected yet.]
;B[ca]C[I kill the stones that I feel are threatening my little group, but I wonder if it would have been easier just to play C6.
---------
Your stones were actually safe the whole time. You could pass at this point.]
;W[bd]C[Not much of a threat to C6 that I can see, but is a threat and starts to make some eye space on the left.
-----------
Once again white is getting desperate.];B[cd]C[I protect the cutting point, feeling pretty sure I can prevent eyes.]
;W[bh]C[White starts to rope off a small territory within mine.]
;B[af]C[I take what would be the critical spot for two eyes, but probably would have been faster to just play at B3.]
;W[ae]C[Attacks the A4 stone.];B[be]C[I try to destroy his wall.]
;W[ag]C[White captures A4.];B[bg]C[I attack the B4 stone planning to split his few stones in this area.]
;W[af]C[He connects solidly to protect the stone at B4. I think this particular move was a little pointless.]
;B[db]C[I protect my last cutting point, probably a pointless move, maybe better to play at E4.]
;W[ef]C[White solidfies his wall.];B[bi]C[This move should not have been needed, but I wanted to make sure I could keep white from making an eye.]
;W[tt]C[White passes having nothing left to do.];B[tt]C[I pass to end the game.
--------
Overall I think you can handle the computer with this sort of handicap. When you play against it with less of a handicap, or against human players in even matches, try and take the initiative more. You were responding to white the entire game! When your opponent plays, try and look and see if there are more important moves on the board. Try and get control of the flow of the game. This will become increasingly important as you get better at go.

C[White may have grabbed some territory on top, but he's in big trouble now. Of course, he would probably see this coming, and try and be more tricky (but that's a whole different game!).]
