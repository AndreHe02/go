C[Hi. I'm Shane (KGS: smonds3 - 2d-3d) . I'll be reviewing.

In this game, both players missed many opportunities in opening. There were many chances for a player to take advantage and instead he/she helped the opponent. Despite the missed opportunities in opening, the game was decided most in endgame. Both players should pay attention to sente/gote and size of moves in yose more.

Thank you for letting me review the game!];B[po]C[vducky [2k\]: have fun]

(;B[pq]LB[oq:A]C[This move seems natural to seal white in, but this contact play is actually incorrect. Playing at "A" is the correct way of sealing white in from this direction.]
(;W[qp]LB[oq:A]C[Whtie should have played A. This is what black is what black wants.]
;B[pp]C[This is very good for B. White has failed to punish the questionable move and has been sealed in. Black's wall is flawless.]
;W[qo];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[jp]
(;B[lp]C[This is 'pushing from thickness'. It is incorrect because it will weaken the approach stone. (see variations for black)]
(;W[kr]LB[lp:A]TR[fq]C[This misses the point. White needs to seize the moment and attack the marked stone to punish the move at A.]
(;B[cq]TR[jp][kr]C[Going into the corner misses the chance to attack the two white stones.]
(;W[cp]LB[dj:A]C[This block is almost never made without a stone already at A or around that area. This direction is normally wrong with an empty side. (see var) 

Also, in this game, letting black link up is slack.];B[dq];W[ep]

(;W[fr]C[Cutting here captures the corner, but damages the outside stones. Also capturing the corner is gote.]
;B[gr];W[dr];B[fs];W[cr]C[This is good for B.];B[bq];W[br]LB[jp:A]
