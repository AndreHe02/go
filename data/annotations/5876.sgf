C[[Y\] Hi, Thanks for looking at my game.  This is a game I played with my friend.  He is 2d+ on IGS, but hasn't played for a while.  We played on a Friday lunch break.

We decided to play an even game.  I take black.  We didn't specify a komi in advance, but assuming no komi.  Also there was no time limit, but assuming we have to finish during lunch break.

I'm looking for two things:

1) my "no-so-common" moves during the game.  It would be nice if you can let me know why my moves are not good.

2) any particular area that I can improve upon would be nice too.

Emp: areas to improve:
1. Life and death
2. Understanding of moyo and influence
3. Good shape, bad shape
4. big and small in ending game.

although b lost the game, but you demostrated sharper eyes for not-so-obvious tricks during the game, if you can improve your thinking on bigger picture, u should be able to beat ur friend with ease in the future.]

C[[Y\] He chose this trick play to see if I know.

Empiror: not a very good tricky move though.]

(;B[fr]C[[Y\] Can I skip this move?  Turns out white gets a lot of influence.

Emp: can't skip here, because if w got E2, b's corner needs to live]

(;W[gq]C[Emp: bad move of w, even there is not cut at G4, b can annoy w by F5.]
;B[qn]C[Emp: left side is bigger, C11 a good choice];W[nq];B[oo]
C[[Y\]  I didn't want to invade because he is strong at the bottom.  I decide to go from influence on my side.

Emp: again, left side is big and urgent for both];W[no]C[Emp: wrong place to go...and wrong tactics too.]
;B[nn];W[mo];B[mn];W[ln]
(;B[qf];W[op];B[po];W[lm]C[[Y\] He's built strong influence for the center.  Am I a bit slow compare to him?

Emp: move like L7, its influence is global, pls try to feel the gravity. but for now, since no white stone at D10, it's an imcomplete moyo of white.]
;B[fc]C[Emp: wrong direction. it's paramount to divide a moyo in its infancy.C11 is a must move now.]

(;W[hc];B[df];W[fd];B[cd];W[cc]C[Emp: wrong move by w, becose it makes b's G18 lethal.]

(;B[bc]C[[Y\] I think G16 would have been better here.

Emp: B17 is simply wrong. it's contradictive with D14 and F17.]

the battle here is very improvising :), i can hardly comment on that. but fair to say, w should have ended up with smile...]

(;B[lg]C[[Y\] At game review, we think N16 is better.  I was thinking the safest way to capture these stones.

Emp: a legitimate concern of yours. btw, the dead w's group at the right side ...by doing  some simple life&death problems, you can effectively improve.]
