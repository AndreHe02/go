[0];B[pd];W[qo];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd];W[cf];B[ch];W[ef]C[PG : This move is not recommended by professionals. That's about all I can say for sure. Still, I often play this move myself.

Jumping in the corner is correct. (Variations B, C & D.) Black gets mighty influence at the top but White comes out of this with territory and sente. A fair trade in principle; White must keep cool and not rush Black. The objective in this area should later be to play lightly and merely reduce. As long as White does not overplay, he can hope to reestablish the balance of territory and influence when Black later approaches White's corners.

One last remark, F14 is possible if White intends to play a center game: the white stone at R5 can readily serve this purpose.]

(;B[fd];W[di]
(;B[cd]C[PG : This is a mistake as White can now settle himself easily. Variation B shows the usual continuation which is almost a joseki.]
;W[ci]C[PG : This move may be a little too tight but I don't know what the correct shape is here.]
;B[pj]L[pq][fq][op]C[PG : Setting up a moyo. It is hard to say if this is correct though. With is next move, White seems to set up his own moyo on a grander scale and may be taking control of the game. An approach move at 'a' or 'b', or 'c' if Black wants to stress the bottom area, is perhaps preferable. But then again maybe this is just a question of style.]
;W[pq];B[fq];W[cn]L[jq][dn][fo][fp]C[PG : A move at 'a' seems preferable as it is both a pincer and an extension. C6 is too conservative. It White is firm in his intention of building up the right side, 'b', 'c', or 'd' show more ambition.]
;B[dr]
(;W[cq]L[hq]C[PG : I feel the corner is small at this point; White could still try to play a pincer around 'a'. Either the right side or the bottom side territories could then start expanding nicely. Variation B is one of the joseki starting with 'a'.]
;B[iq];W[pf]L[qf][nc][nd][hd][qc][kq]C[PG : This seems correct. In the same situation, I would personnaly consider other moves also at 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' and 'e' but I would be hard put to justify any one of them in particular.


Approaching on the right side does have the advantage of pressuring the lone black stone a Q10. This is probably the soundest strategy.


Jumping in the corner is interesting as long as White can get sente and pursue with reducing maneuvers. 'e' could also be one stone to the left or one stone lower ifWhite wishes to emphasize one side or the other.


There is a big point left around 'f'. Further play should take this into consideration.]
;B[nd]
(;W[ql]L[qd][qm]C[PG : This may be a little premature. White should probably settle his stone at Q14 before by playing at 'a'. If Black later extends down the side to 'b', White can aim at extending left on the bottom side. Variation B is one possibility.]
;B[ph];W[nf]L[qd]C[PG : I think 'a' is still possible for White to settle his group.]

(;B[ol]L[qf][mi]C[PG : I wonder if variation B, or any other variation starting with'a' may be possible here: White will be able to settle himself butBlack will get a strong position in the center in exchange.
In any event, I think 'b' was the correct move for Black..];W[le];B[lc]
;W[ni]C[PG : White has been allowed to settle himself nicely around this area. I feel like Black lost some ground here.]
;B[og]
(;W[of]C[PG : Variation B shows an alternative strategy for White.];B[ng]
;W[mg];B[mh];W[lg];B[lh];W[kh];B[ki];W[kg];B[lj];W[mq]L[ii][qm]C[PG : 'a' shows more ambition; Black does not need to answer N3.

Anyways, the situation in the center is still not settled and White's tenuki may prove foolhardy. Black should keep the pressure up with 'a'. He can then aim at sealing the top and building a vast center moyo.

There is also a weakness at 'b' to consider.];B[fo]L[ii][en]C[PG : Too slow. Black doesn't gain much by playing here and helps White consolidate his left side. Again, by first initiating and attack with 'a', Black can then gain leverage to launch a deeper invasion or reduction of the left side.

I think the weak point to consider for immediate play would be 'b'.];W[en]
;B[qe];W[gm];B[fn]L[ii][qf]C[PG : Pushing into the knight move is rarely good. Black should instead consider 'a' or follow up on the right with 'b'.]
;W[fm];B[ii];W[ge];B[gd];W[he];B[hd];W[jh];B[hj];W[hg];B[ej];W[dk];B[ek]
;W[el];B[qm];W[pm];B[pl]L[qf][qn]C[PG : Since Black still needs another move at 'a' to make territory out of the right side, it may be preferable to start a fight with 'b' instead of Q8. This should allow Black to reduce the lower right corner as things develop.    Before starting this fight however, Black must be confident in his skill for 'b' leads to a rocky road. (Truth is, it may be entirely unreasonable, but I cannot read it out.)]
;W[rm];B[qk];W[qn];B[qf];W[rk];B[rj];W[ji];B[jj];W[pg];B[nh]L[qh]C[PG : Safe but 'a' would be more consistent with previous moves. I think Black can handle the cut that would follow.]
;W[ml];B[om];W[nk];B[lm]C[PG : That's the spirit! White is asking for trouble.]
;W[mm]
(;B[nn]C[PG : Black is letting White of the hook. Variation B seems correct.]

;W[kl];B[qg];W[gp]
(;B[gq]L[fp]C[PG : 'a' looks ok for Black but then it looks as though White even if he may not kill the black group gets to squeeze it in sente; so the move played is probably right. The situation is actually very complicated and beyond me.

(;B[oi]L[bf][jl][dq][be]C[PG : Small but most of all gote. 'a', 'b' or 'c' are bigger. ('a' could be at 'd' also).

jloup: I don't think that p11 is small; it avoids variation B.];W[be];B
[bd];W[ad];B[ac];W[ae];B[bc];W[mi];B[li];W[sj];B[ri];W[ok];B[pk];W[mk]L[jl][dq]C[PG : Another small gote move. 'a'or 'b' are bigger. Black still be leading but I think the game would be close.]

;B[bs]L[nq]C[PG : This is one possibility. Black is alive and White has sente. What is diificult to assess is the fact that Black, in this continuation still has some aji left at 'a'.


(Actually, this may all be bogus. The more I look at the initial position, the more it seems likely that there may be a variation where Black dies, but...)]

[lp][no][oo][nj]C[PG : I think Black wins here.


If White 'a' or 'b' then Black can get enough liberties to win the race with 'c' (possibly followed by 'd') and then playing at 'e'.

If White 'c', then Black 'b' and I can't find any continuation for White.]
))
(;W[ng];B[of];W[jf]L[qc][qd]C[PG : White's position in the center seems promising. The right side is still vulnerable to a slide from R8 and the corner can still be invaded at 'a' or 'b' (though a ko would probably have to be played out).]
