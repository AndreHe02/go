C[Hi, I'm Todd, and I'll be dropping notes through the game, along with (hopefully) variations and ideas at key points. It's been a while since I've played myself, but I think I should still be able to be some help.]

C[SlackerFox [11k?\]: Boy, I didn't see that coming (rolls eyes)]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[pc]C[I think I would've played this down at S15 instead. That helps create a moyo on the right side, rather than the territory near the center here. You're working here at keeping white out of the top right, but L18 is already going to give him some leverage into that area.]
;W[re];B[rc];W[qb];B[rb];W[qe];B[of];W[qi];B[qj];W[ri];B[jp]
C[I don't care much for this move, but that's probably more personal preference than anything.  With white's R11 and S11 peeking in a little to the lower right, it seems like, if you want to work on that territory, a little closer to R4 might be better.

Other alternate moves would be Q11 to keep white out of the upper right center area, or S10, which threatens to really reduce white's eye space on the right.  Again, though, those are probably more preferences than right vs. wrong.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[lq];B[iq]C[I'm not sure what the point of this move is, unless it's to eventually make the two-space jump to F3 and settle in at the bottom.  It seems like a slow move - you could probably jump out to G3 right here - if white were to attack that stone, in trying to defend it your L4 group would become more powerful and might be of more use.  Yeah, seems like a slow move.]
;W[oq];B[pq]C[A move like this makes it pretty important to drop down to S10 - I think that secures a really large corner for you.]
;W[op];B[pn];W[lp];B[fq]C[Good.];W[cl];B[pm]C[I think this move is really, really slow.  S10 is better, but an even better (although more dangerous) move is probably to try to get in to white's right side, even something like C10, just to try to reduce that somehow, or D4, perhaps?  I'm not the greatest at attacking areas like that (but who is?), but that to me seems like a priority instead of the move at Q7.]
;W[hf];B[if];W[hg];B[jh];W[hi];B[eo]C[Not aggressive enough.]
;W[em]C[This move is huge for white, I think - it threatens to make a large territory on the left side or near the center (or both).]
;B[fn]C[Too slow, not aggressive enough. Sure, you're making territory, just as you did with the exchange around J14/H13/K12, but you're just trading, or even coming up on the short end. White here is happy to see this move - he's not too concerned about the territory you might make centered around H5, because he can attack you and gain much more territory.

Perhaps a move like B10, which threatens to jump out to D10 or across to B14 would be good as well.  Just some more ideas.]
;W[fm];B[ij]C[Okay, but still sort of trading territory, and I believe you're losing this game, so you have to do more than just trade.]
;W[hj];B[ii]C[Much, much too slow, especially since white can still press into the other side of this center territory using R11.]

(;B[or]C[More important here to get S10 or Q11.

Another attack variation is given.];W[nr];B[pr];W[ln];B[km]
C[Not sure what this move accomplishes - white can still easily push into any group he wants using J8 and M6.  This move is spaced too far out from L4, etc., to support them, and too far from Q7 or J10, too. This stone floats out there, alone.]
;W[lm]
(;B[kl]C[Here, you're allowing white to push into your territory - building a black wall along L8 doesn't gain anything at all, and strengthens white's group.

See variation for a better move.];W[kn];B[jn];W[oh]C[This is the move that you should have been dreading, threatening to reduce that center territory to virtually nothing.]
;B[pg];W[qg];B[ll]C[Here, you're stuck - I don't care for this move, but the fact is that your center area is being attacked on two fronts, so it IS tough to try to defend.  A good, solid, tight move in a bad situation.]
;W[nm]
(;B[ml]C[Too slow. Jump out to match at O8, or just turn and focus an attack around Q12 (variation).]
;W[om];B[ol]C[Not sure what this is going for - white can still push through.]

;W[ni]C[I like the attack down low - I didn't think it was going to work out, but now you need to focus on finishing off that group - the game depends on it - and that means keeping it separated from the upper right.]

(;B[cj]C[Why leave the attack on the lower right now?  See variation.]
;W[bi];B[oi];W[ph];B[ls];W[ks];B[nq];W[ir];B[nr]C[dantesxx [10k\]: This is a way better (and harder for me) game already ;)

I think you should've let this ko go. White has a LOT to lose, potentially, if you manage to take that lower white group - you could certainly gain something from it, and your lower right black group is obviously solid. I would've continued to trade punches.]
;W[hr];B[dr];W[er]C[SlackerFox [11k?\]: That may have just been a huge mistake. D'oh]

dantesxx [10k\]: Poor Fox...
SlackerFox [11k?\]: Yes.];B[ko]C[dantesxx [10k\]: ?
dantesxx [10k\]: Don't you want an undo?
SlackerFox [11k?\]: Nope. If I missed something, I missed it]
;W[rk];B[rl];W[qk];B[pk];W[rj];B[ql]C[dantesxx [10k\]: I let you off easily ;)]
;W[og]C[SlackerFox [11k?\]: You'll have to tell me why after the game. I missed something

At this point, most of the rest of it is pretty straightforward, and the game is already decided.

Here's a summation of what I noticed, overall:

I didn't think you played badly. The biggest mistakes I saw (which I'm also guilty of):

1) Being too quick to respond to every move white makes. White is able to drag your attention around the board and dictate play. Remember that you don't have to respond to each of white's moves (I know it's obvious, but everyone forgets, especially online, and you get into this rhythm of playing in one area of the board). The whole board is always in play and you need to evaluate situations across the board at each turn.

2) Not aggressive enough.  This is a tough one to get good at because there's a fine line between being timid and overaggressive, both of which get punished.  Your defense of the center was dictated by white's play and very timid on row 8, especially when pushing down N8, N7, etc.; those moves didn't gain much for either side, and there were better options available.

Your third move, at R10, is a defensive play, which is a fine style, but one I'm not accustomed to; I like to get in and start attacking, start dictating the pace of the game. A move like R10, to me, seems like it turns over control of the game to white pretty early (if white wants to take it). But, also, obviously R10 is a pretty common move, so it's not a bad one.  Just a style that I think creeps into the rest of your game, being a little too defensive. Don't be afraid to sacrifice a stone for leverage.

Really, overall I thought the game was pretty solid. Like I said, I'm a little rusty, but I didn't see any glaring errors that you or your opponent didn't discuss or note - most of the "mistakes" were in a much broader sense.

Lastly, I guess, remember that the center is really, really tough to make decent territory in.  As you know, your major center territory was reduced to scraps by the end - white was able to succeed with a large lower left and left side.  It's really tempting to start building walls facing the center and spend a lot of time trying to protect it, as you did, but often turns out to be fruitless.]

(;B[oj];W[nj];B[ph];W[pi];B[oi];W[og];B[pf];W[pk];B[qk]C[Something like this puts you in a nice position to attack both of white's groups.  A move like Black R12 is trouble, so white probably has to defend there, which can allow you to finish the attack on the lower group (or vice versa).  Maybe I'm missing something - not sure why you abandoned the attack when you had the chance to split two vulnerable white groups.]
