C[xxc : hi, i'll do the review of this game from b side with 10k "handi" !

it was played on a "turn based server" tournament, it is important because this kind of games let's much more time to think about moves, especialy for b

in this kind of false even game with "high handi", we have 100pts here, we can say that keeping a result under 100pts for b is a good result
to do this, b should play a solid and simple game
w can simply wait and keep the lead all the game long waiting for mistakes

let's see if this append here];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]LB[cl:1]C[xxc : i think this is ok for b

a strong group at lower left
a week point at 1];W[oq]C[xxc : 2 ways here pincer or not

let's have a look at what this can look after a fiew moves]
(;B[mq];W[qo]C[xxc: here you can be sure it may becomes difficult

w is asking b "what do you want ? ... i'm ok, i can fight, and each stone may be usefull later !"]
(;B[op];W[po];B[pp];W[qk]C[xxc : this result doesn't seem's that good for b

w had a group now at right side and P3 stil anoying

perhaps P4 at Q5 is beter with this idea behind "get strong against strong stones (R5) to attack weak ones (P3)"]
;B[ro]C[xxc : this one is too early];W[rn];B[rp];W[qm]SQ[rn]
[ro][rp]C[xxc : shape move, really interesting, let's spend some time on it

w invade lower side with P3, "split" on right side and after the cut gets a group on the right side

let's go back before S5 (withdraw square stones)
the w group is weak but had space on left side, b can play elsewhere

it is difficult to explain, but i think this is really important to understand

b is stronger than w in the corner, and then the w side group is weak
P3 is still here, but if w want to move from this one, b lives on the corner and w gets a weak group on the bottom side or w lives small in the corner and b gets a big bottom side
perhaps later b gets a stone at R11 and can invade at R7 or using the threat to invade at R7 b can build a wall P6-8-10

now, with S5-R7, the w group is alive, P3 gets more strengh and can be used by w later, Q16 is weaker and L3 may be a good target for w (with this last one, perhaps N3 beter at M3)

you can also had a look with S5 at P5
this one changes a lot, a threat for the right w group, but at the same time a strong move for b at the bottom side]
;B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[cj]C[Do you think I should have invaded his framework on the left at either C8 or C12?

xxc : not without J17 !
but before F17 you can spend time to think about it, depending your own taste playing at C14 can be ok

now, there is still weaknesses in w side at C8-14, b can play to target it]
;B[qg]C[xxc : i do not like this one, it's a kind a move asking your opponent "what should i play ?"

if b want to strenghten the corner then R16
if b want to "attack' the white group R11, now it's too late to do that, play it from S5 and perhaps you'l get something interesting (S5 at F17 and now R13 at R11)]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[pb];B[oc]C[xxc : why ?

b needs w to run toward the center here, to get stones arrond J13 to invade left side no ?]

(;B[ld]C[xxc : N16 ?];W[qd];B[qe];W[rd];B[md];W[rb];B[ff]C[xxc : looks like an other R13

D12, E11 or D8 or center to threat big from one of b side];W[fe]
;B[hf];W[fd];B[gc];W[fg];B[gf];W[pi]C[xxc : from here i think it's over]

xxc : b had weak groups in the center, it's time to play to help these stones not to enlarge territories]
;W[kq]C[What would have reacted to this invasion?

;W[he];B[ge];W[je];B[hd];W[kf];B[ke];W[jd];B[id];W[kh]C[xxc : i hope this comment will help

opening is ok, but after b had problems to get a plan
i think it's ok according the 100pts spoted at the begin

with the same way to open
less moves on the right side and a plan to invade/reduce left, it could have been fine
