;B[pp]C[Daniel: Hello, my name is Daniel and I'll be doing your review.  Thanks for submitting your game for review.  I'll prefix my comments with "Daniel:" so you can tell what's me if there are other comments in the sgf, and I'll leave some general notes for improvement on the last move.]
;W[dd];B[pc];W[dp]
(;B[fc]
(;W[ec]C[Daniel: I don't like this joseki choice unless W already has a pincer stone in place.  I'll explain why at the conclusion of the joseki.  It's not a huge mistake, but it would be better to choose a different joseki.]
;B[fd];W[df];B[jc]C[Daniel: The 3-3 is still open to B, and W doesn't seem to have gotten much out of this while B is solid along the top.]

(;W[qj];B[ql]
(;W[qg];B[qe]LB[qg:b][qj:a]C[Daniel: It's not ideal that B was able to naturally get this extension here, ideally, W would like to approach at least one space closer so B doesn't have room to make the extension.  This could be achieved by different play with either A or B.  In addition to the extension, W is now already under attack here.]
;W[og];B[nd];W[ok];B[om];W[nq]C[Daniel: This seems questionable.  The middle group isn't totally secure and B is strong in this area.  This stone looks likely to come under severe attack immediately.]
;B[oq];W[np]
(;B[fq]
(;W[eq]LB[jp:b][jq:a]C[Daniel: This is an even worse time to use the kick joseki!  After B stands up, both W and B will desperately want a stone at A or B and B is going to have sente to get it.]
;B[fp];W[kq]LB[dn:c][jp:b][jq:a]C[Daniel: Several problems with this move.  First, you should generally extend three spaces from a two space wall, like B did with K17, so if you're going to play on the bottom, you need to play at A or B.  This is uneccessarily cramped and gives B too much space.  Second, a play at C is hard for W to skip at this point.  If you kick, you need to extend.  If you can't extend because you need to pincer, you shouldn't have kicked in the first place, you should have just pincered.]
;B[do]C[Daniel: Good punishment by B.];W[co];B[dn]
(;W[cn]C[Daniel: josekipedia says this is a mistake.  B refutation according to josekipedia is shown.]

(;B[cq]C[This was an interesting move. It challenged me. Not sure I responded well.

Daniel: Yeah, it is.  It looks like B should be able to take away W's corner with this move.]
;W[cp]C[Daniel: I don't think W has any other options than this response.]
;B[er]
(;W[bq]C[Trying to keep my stones connected.

Daniel: Your stones are already connected, so I'm not sure what you mean by this comment.  This move seems slack to me.]
;B[dq];W[ep]
(;B[cr]
(;W[fo]C[Thought this was the best countermove.

Daniel: I think letting yourself get cut is unnecessarily risky.]

(;B[hp];W[dm]C[Wanted to try and capture. As you'll see this wasn't ultimately successful.

Daniel: This is a fine move, but I don't think the idea of capturing these stones is great.  First, they aren't particularly important stones.  Second, they are going to be hard to capture because they can just run with E6 whenever they want.  I like this move because it means B can't play E5 directly, and because it develops the left nicely.]
;B[ei];W[ci]C[Daniel: This seems reasonable.];B[ek];W[ko]TR[ei]
[ek]C[Trying to build towards the middle.

Daniel: I think this is reasonable.  Especially since B has just created a weak group.]
;B[fg]C[Black seems focused on outside influence.

Daniel: And security for that group.];W[nm]C[Starting to build more in the center.]
;B[on];W[nn];B[mg];W[mf]C[Trying to cut under and keep Black from getting comfortable in the center.]
;B[nf];W[ng];B[me];W[lf];B[le]
(;W[lg]C[Daniel: It is often bad to play atari if you haven't read a specific sequence to capture afterwards.  I think this is one of those times.  After B extends, he'll have three liberties which is one more than he had before.]
;B[mh];W[lh];B[mi]C[I was getting nervous but was confident I could defeat Black.]
;W[li];B[mj];W[kk]C[Thought this was better than continuing the wall. Creates more space for White.

Daniel: Yeah.  Seems reasonable.  Always good not to push from behind.]
;B[of]
(;W[pf]TR[qj][ok][nm]C[Not sure this was necessary. Thought it was better than building straight down. See variation.

Daniel: I don't think it was necessary, but I don't think it's particularly bad.  It looks sente and it is helpful to have, so as long as B responds, it should be okay.  I do agree that it's better than Q13.  I think you can just tenuki to play elsewhere though, possibly to eliminate aji around the triangled stones.]

(;B[pe];W[in];B[hn]C[Building up in the center.];W[im];B[hm]
;W[il];B[en];W[fm]C[Daniel: This leaves a lot of cutting points for B to exploit.  A net move like this is only good if it works, so you should read it out before playing it and make sure it does.]
;B[em];W[el];B[dl];W[cm];B[fl];W[hk]C[Daniel: Not really sure what the point of this move is.  It's not very big in terms of points.  You might be better off with something like C8, or if you definitely want to play locally, at least play H10.]
;B[je];W[jf];B[if];W[jg];B[ig];W[ih];B[gg];W[hh];B[nk];W[nl]
;B[ol];W[oj];B[ph]C[This forced me to respond. Perhaps better to follow the variation earlier.

Daniel: You seemed to get a fine result to me with what was played in the game.]

;W[rj];B[rf];W[cl];B[ck];W[bk];B[cj];W[bj];B[di]
(;W[dh]C[Daniel: Too much, as punished in the game.  W should just extend to C12.]
;B[ch];W[bi];B[dg]C[This cost me quite a bit. Not sure if I should have just walked the stones earlier. See variation. Maybe better?

Daniel: I think the variation is better than the game, but W can do better than that.  See my variation on move 118.]

(;W[bh];B[cg];W[eh];B[fh];W[dj];B[dk]
(;W[fn]C[Trying to use my dead stones to build pressure on Black.

Daniel: Don't go fishing while your house is on fire.  I think your top priority at this point need to be securing the upper left.]
;B[cf];W[eo];B[el];W[ce];B[cc]C[Just like earlier. Not sure if I did  a good job responding seeing as this group barely survived.]
;W[be];B[eb];W[bc];B[cb];W[gl]C[Daniel: I think you still need to help the top left.  You could easily play B14 to connect out and ensure life.]

Daniel: B can just live with B2, so that's a futile goal.];B[jq]

(;W[gs]
(;B[ds];W[br];B[fs];W[hs]C[Black lives small. Wasted effort on my part?

Daniel: Making Black live small is a good result, and I don't think you could have killed.  I think you got a fine result here, except that it's now B's sente, which is big.  This sequence would have been better later when a few more big points had been played.]
;B[cs]C[Daniel: Wasted move by B.  Not neccesary to live.]
(;W[or]C[Daniel: Way too small and destroys your aji.];B[pr]
;W[op];B[pq];W[nr]C[Daniel: I know this looks important, but it's gote, and for B to take P2 would be gote as well.  I think there are bigger moves on the board, like B14 or T7 for example.]
;B[oo];W[pl];B[pm];W[rl];B[rm];W[rk];B[qm];W[ke]C[Daniel: This is small and gote, and in retrospect was your last chance to play B14.]
;B[kd];W[kf];B[cd];W[bd];B[bf];W[af];B[ag]C[In retrospect a bad move for me since Black has more liberties here.]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[bb];B[ba];W[db]C[I thought this was clever. Thought my group would live easily. As you'll see it's only by the skin of my teeth that this group survived.]

;B[da];W[ri]C[Daniel: Huh?  What does this accomplish?  You definitely owe a move in the upper left.  You don't actually need to fight the ko.  Just take at A19, but this just kills already dead stones, and W is in trouble in the upper left.]
;B[cb];W[cc];B[ca];W[ie]C[Daniel: Gotta go live in the upper left right now.]

Daniel: Yep.  Be could have killed for a while ago, and W needed to defend a long time ago.]

C[Was concerned throughout this sequence whether Black's attack would work. Confident it wouldn't, but still very nervous.

Daniel: Yeah, you're well connected here.  Nothing to worry about.]
;B[qf]
(;W[kl]C[Daniel: No need.  This is a pass.  Q1 is a massive move you could play instead.]

;B[lp];W[lq];B[tt];W[tt]C[Things I think I did well: (1) Keep my stones connected. (2) Build influence in the middle. (3) Work across different parts of the board. Things to improve: (1) Letting opponent build influence on corners/sides. Almost cost me the game. (2) Keeping groups alive (see top left!) (3) Playing too passively (perhaps) b/c Black got such influence.

Daniel: I think this is a generally reasonable assessment.  The biggest thing you can do for your go game is just doing more go problems to get better at reading.  Generally speaking, you could stand to have more general awareness of the life and death status of groups to know when you have a chance to threaten your opponent, and when you need to defend yourself.  Besides that, move 22 was a huge mistake in fuseki.  Make sure you understand why.  And fall out of love with the kick joseki.  It's more of a special case joseki than something to be played regularly.  Good luck with your go playing!]
