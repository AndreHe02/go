C[Hello.
I submitted this game for some general advice on playing this type of game. Although I won this time, I generally have problems playing against strong sides like this one (sanrensei formations and the like). So I'm looking for some advice on when and how to reduce the large moyo that tends to come out of it before it grows too strong.

I played as white

- Kamber



Darrell:  Hi.  I haven't looked at the game yet, but it sounds like a hard question to answer.  I'll do my best.  I'm about 3 kyu AGA.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[qf];W[ep];B[qn];W[np];B[qj]LB[pg:B]
[pj:A][ol:C]C[Now. I know that a side like that is supposed to be conservative, with most of the stones on the third line. But it seems to me that the influence it creates puts me at a disadvantage right off the bat.


D:  Well, the feeling that my opponent has gotten something way too good or that I'm at a disadvantage in a game is one of my demons too.  But when stronger players look at the situation I'm afraid of, they usually say it's nothing.

This is a good example of that.  Actually, I think black's position is quite poor.  It's very flat down on the third line, and the spaces are too wide to be a settled position.  At a minimum, black should have played at A.

So -- his position is too low to be effective for influence, and with the wide gaps, you can invade and destory the territory too.  Or if influence becomes important, you can play pressing moves like B or C and really flatten him down.  

I would rather be white in this game.];W[ed];B[df]
(;W[dc]C[D:  This move is quite wrong and is probably where you get in trouble.  Black is going to get too much on the left and your group will be weak.

Please look at and learn the joseki in the variation.  It comes up a lot.]
;B[cc];W[hc];B[jc]C[D:  Now white is under attack and the game turns hard.]
;W[lc]C[D:  This looks like a bad idea.  You are creating a second weak group.  Black has one weak group running out between two weak white groups.  This is a recipe for trouble.]
;B[mb]LB[kd:A]C[D:  Bad move by black.  He should separate white with a move like A.]
;W[jb]C[Good.];B[mc];W[ld];B[lb];W[jd];B[jq];W[hq]LB[cp:B][pp:A]
TR[lq]C[D:  Which of your groups is weaker -- A or B?

Answer is A, so help that group instead.];B[mq];W[nq];B[mr]
;W[ck];B[ci];W[dj]LB[cg:B][ek:A]C[D:  Just jumping out to A is better.  It threatens an invasion at B later.]
;B[ei];W[ej]C[D:  Now you're pushing from behind.];B[bj];W[io]
;B[jo];W[in]C[D:  Nice way to profit from an attack.];B[jn]

C[Now, he ended up letting me have a large territory in the lower left, which is why I ended up winning. But it seems to me that there's gotta be a better way to win these games than to either pull off a huge territory somewhere else or kill a large group.

D:  Well, I think the better lesson is that black's stones were not actually efficient.  They only looked scary.]
;B[ie];W[id];B[mn]TR[ni]C[I consider playing some reducing move, like O 11. Would that work here?

D:  Well your lower right corner is mostly surrounded and is weak.  You have to handle that before you do anything else.]
;W[km];B[ll];W[kn];B[ko]
(;W[ji]LB[qe:B][qq:A]TR[ce][ee][fe][he][di]SQ[ld]C[I ended up playing this move, but I don't think it was severe enough. It ended up turning his side into a very large territory.

D:  What would you do if black played at A?  I think it's going to be very hard for your corner to survive.

Ok, ignoring the corner for the moment, with those widely spaced black stones, plus your marked stone, black's right side should be very easy to handle.  A stronger player would probably have better ideas about this, but take a look at the variation.  There are a thousand ways to play in here, this is just an idea.

Also, black has left a lot of holes over here.  The left center could end up largely white.]
;B[ii]C[Funny move by black.]
(;W[jh]LB[ij:A]C[I would play A.  It protects your territory and weakens his stone further.]
;B[ih];W[ij];B[lh];W[lj];B[mj];W[li];B[mi]
(;W[mh]C[This may be a good move, but it certainly will get complicated.  Is there an easier way?]
;B[nh];W[mg];B[ng];W[mf];B[ne];W[me];B[nd];W[on]C[Here I attempted a final reduction, because it seemed to me that he had way more territory than me at this point.

(;W[hf]LB[ok:A]C[This reduction ended up working quite well, because it sealed off my territory without letting him have any. But I'm not sure if he defended optimally.


D:  There's still some interesting aji at A you could use at some point.  See variation.]

Thanks for taking the review!


D:  You're welcome.  I hope it helps some.

For a more interesting answer to your question, Shygost gave a lecture on reducing moyos.  I'll try to find it for you.  PM me on KGS sometime.  My handle is "snip"]
