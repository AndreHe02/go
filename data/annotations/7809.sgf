AB[pd][dp]C[Notes to the reviewer: White loses a lot of small groups, but I'm not sure which particular move is the root mistake.  Any help with tactical variations would be very much appreciated.

Thank you for your time!

Reviewer: Hello I'm Bernardo... any further questions please e-mail me at bernardottr@hotmail.com.]

(;W[mm];B[mn];W[nn]C[After review my impression is that White put too much pressure and invade more that should.
When you invade more than you can you end up dead and lose points instead of gain. Example D7.

F2 was one of the lose moves. It's a good move in other situations, but defende the moyo was more urgent to not end up with the k6 group.

Handicaps games are hard to play, but you can learn a lot with then. Keep going and try to aprimorate the invasions.

You have a niec moyo, defeden it is sure a good Idea. The best thing should be not get invaded anymore.]

Yes, like I told before.. if You read black dead, B18 was necessary.]

You end up with a nice wall at the other variation.];B[pl];W[ok]

If you think that you can kill black B17, B18 is ok. i you dont, invade at R9 is a huge point.]

This move is good for 2 reasons.
1 - White group is more stable
2 - Gives the possibility to invade black territory]))

Absolutely.]))
(;W[po]C[is this better?

Since it's a Handicap game, this is good to put pressure.]))
