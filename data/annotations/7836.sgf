AB[pd][dp][pp]C[coldfire08 [3k\]: hello
Prezli [1d\]: hi];W[ed]C[Dear Reviewer, I added some questions throughout the game at certain moves. In this game, it seemed like I lost a lot of territory early on, but gained a lot of strong central influence. However, the battle in the center of the board didn't go well and had to resign. Please review for black, thanks.

MR: Please find comments both on the spots where you made comments yourself and on other spots that seemed important to me. 

The main comments are on
a) direction of play and follow throw with strategical plans
b) alternative moves in "battles that did not go well"

Placing an enclosed black group in the upper left corner already did part of what caused your trouble later on. After that, it seemed that you did not really make up your mind on where you want to make your territory ... Allowing white to live with a 200 percent dead group finally decided the game.]
;B[cd]C[MR: Entering the corner directly tends to give white outside influence - no problem in general, but in a handicap game black can better utilize his handicap stones for influence oriented games.]
;W[df];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd]C[MR: This joseki gives outside influence to white, while black gets corner territory. Locally, the continuation is black B14. Tenuki is ok, then white can exchange white B15 for black B16 (or similar exchanges).]
(;B[jc]C[Would a move around C10 been better in this situation?
MR: No, white's preferred continuation is to extend the upper side with e.g. O17, so black wants to play on the upper edge as well. Whether K17 is the ideal point, is another question. N17 or L17 would be other options. K17 is rather near to the white thickness, and black has no really good answer to white O17, as M17 is too small an extension from K17.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[bp];B[cq]C[Would it have been better for me to try and break in to white's moyo now, rather than this block?
MR: This is one sensible joseki here.];W[bf];B[pj]C[At this time, I didn't see how I could profit much from breaking into white's moyo, so I settled for a move here.
MR: Unless you know exactly what will happen in the upper left corner, the usual idea would be to answer to B14 in the corner. With respect to the rest of the board, Q10 is fine.]

(;W[dl];B[iq]C[I defended here because this seemed to have become an important weakness in my position. I was having difficulty seeing how to effectively deal with a white move in this area.
MR: It is definitively a good idea to finish off the joseki on the lower edge after white continued the joseki with D8.]
;W[nq]
(;B[lq]C[MR: Black has more potential on the right side than on the bottom, especially as J3 is low. So I would prefer to attack white with P3 ff, see variation.]
;W[pn];B[np];W[mp];B[mq];W[qp]
(;B[pq]C[I feel like this move was submissive, but I didn't see a good continuation from either hane after white crosscuts.
MR: Your feeling is correct that black cannot block at R3 because of white Q6. Q3 is one of the options, P3 is another option, playing tenuki after white R3.]
;W[qq];B[po];W[qo];B[no];W[ni];B[ph];W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[MR: This blocking direction does not fit with Q12. Also, because K17 is low and white is very strong around F16, black cannot hope to get much territory on the top. Therefore, blocking at R16 is better.]

;W[je];B[ek]C[I thought that white's stones in the center were a bit loosely connected, so I tried leaning on his side position to see if I can disconnect them.
MR: I understand that you feel that you "have to do something". The game is already looking rather close which is a bad sign for black in a three-stone handicap game ...]

(;B[hd]C[I didn't want to give white time to play here and connect directly
MR: It is definitely one of the last chances to continue your plan of separating the white stones in the center. However, H16 does not really work. I would have tried J15 to get at least some profit ...]
;W[he];B[ge];W[id];B[hf];W[ie];B[gf]C[MR: I do not really understand your current plan. Like this, you cannot cut off anything from white ... and it also does not look like that your stones surround much territory in the center either ...]
;W[ic];B[nk];W[fm];B[gm];W[gn];B[fn];W[fl];B[gl];W[hn];B[go]
;W[im]C[MR: Ok, now your plan definitively needs to be to kill this center white stones. By placing these stones here around J7, white is - unnecessarily - giving you a chance to come back into the game.]

At this point, I had very little real territory, and didn't see any way to continue.
