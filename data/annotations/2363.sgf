C[LongJing: Hi
LongJing: Have a good game

Dan: I had the black stones.


It is a real pity you managed to lose this game. Up to about move 75, you had done a good job of killing white on the left, and so where about 15 points ahead. If you had avoided trouble at the top, this should have been a won game.

On the evidence in this game, one of the biggest defects in your play is you are playing luke-warm moves when there are much better points in the same local area. The most glaring examples are moves 49, 59 and 83. Perhaps 71 too. Not so much failing to read, but more failing to spot the opportunities that are available. No, that is not quite it. Perhaps it is better sumarised by saying that you need to get a feeling for the right shape, or the natural flow of moves, in common positions.

To be a strong player, your stones need to hit the right points instictively, so that they do the most to help you, and to irritate the opponent. This needs to be instinctive, because you will be playing over 100 moves in a game, and you can't afford to to worry about all the details of every move. You have to save your mental powers for the really important decisions.

The best way to train this kind on instict is to do lots of simple problems. Collections like Graded Go Problems volumes 3 and 4, and Get Strong at Tesuji are the sort of thing I mean. If you find them enjoyable, then they would probably do you a lot of good.

Another way to get a feeling for what a full value move looks like is to study joseki. They contain lots of good moves, and contain examples of the natural flow of moves in certain situations.

Another good book about getting your moves to flow properly is Tesuji and Anti-suji of Go. This is a book that I would particularly recommend to you. Not so much for the particular moves that it talks about, but more because of the general attitude towards the game that it is trying to describe. However, I should warn you that I know some people to don't like the style of Tesuji and Anti-suji, so this is not an unqualified recommendation.]

(;B[jc]C[There is nothing wrong with this move, but it feels a little negative to me. It is just concerned with stopping white's development, but it does not help black much. I would rather approach at C14. (see variation).]
;W[cf]C[Now it is much harder for you to find a good move on the left side, should you want to extend there.]
;B[qj];W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[lp];B[ck];W[fq]
(;B[nc]C[This feels like the wrong way. I would rather play at R14 to expand the larger black formation.]
;W[qh]C[This looks too thin.]
(;B[oj]C[So this is very obidient. Surely you must invade at R14.]
;W[pb]
(;B[ne]C[Dan: I feel squeamish about this move.  Is this really the best Black can do?

No, you shoud still want to invade white's thin formation. Either at R14, or perhaps better to start with the attachment at Q15.]
;W[pf];B[gc]LB[ob:A]C[Dan: Maybe A would've been better?

No, A is an endgame move.

Would F17 have been better than this move? it puts more pressure on white's corner, at the expense of being slightly thinner. It is hard to choose.

Certainly playing somehwere here is a good way to strengthen your group at the top before white gets to play H17, so you have the right idea.]

[cj][pk][rk][sk][cl][pl][cm][pm][cn][po][dp][qp][gq][hq][iq]
[kq][mq][rq][cr][gr][or][sr][cs][gs][ps]C[This is a good move.

White's group in the top left is, of course, quite solid, but now you have approached it with strong stones on both sides, it is not necessarily 100% safe.

You may be able to achieve something starting at A or B. Probably B is better.   This is not something to try immediately, but there is some sort of aji here for later.


The other thing about this move is that it is the last opening move, so this looks like a good place to stop and estimate the score. I have shown the standard sort of boundaries, as explained in the book "Positional Judgement".   White: 13 + 18 + 16 = 47
Black: 10 + 23 + 16 = 49

So, basially, the postition is still balanced. White has the next move, but black has more stones facing the centre.]
;W[cm]C[OK, so white has invaded.   This upsets the territorial balance we just looked at, so later black will have to get compensation somewhere.

But for now, white has created a very weak group. You can choose how to attack, and white will have to defend. This gives you the initiative. What do you want to achive by attacking?   One plan is that the white stone at F3 is quite weak. So you can either chase white towards it, then play a leaning move. Alternatively, you could try to gets some stones around F6 while attacking, and then invade at H3 to try to capture the white stone.   Another option is that there are quite a lot of centre-facing stones in the top half of the board, so you could try to get some stones along Row 9 while attacking, and try to make a big moyo in the top centre.   Then there is the plan which is what seems to happen in the game. White has invaded deeply in a strong black formation, so you can try to kill. Normally quite dangerous. In this game, it seems to work.]
;B[dl];W[cp];B[co];W[dm];B[em];W[en];B[dn];W[bm];B[bo]C[I want to play the hane at B4, to supress the white stone more.]

;B[fm];W[fl]C[By about now, you get the feeling that it would have been nice for black to have played the leaning move at F4, however, I cannot see a moment when you had time to do so. Anyway, you seem to get on well enough without it.]
;B[fn];W[ep];B[dp];W[eo];B[cl]C[Why do you play here? Whis is dead without it. It is more important to play on the outside.]

(;W[bl]C[This is very generous of white. It only increases white's liberies from 4 to 6. If I was white I would play somewhere in the middle, perhaps G8, aiming to get a squeeze on the three black cutting stones.]

(;B[hm]C[This is too kind to white. Since white is short of liberties, I think that you can play hane at G8.]
;W[gl]
(;B[in]C[Wrong direction. I would play at H5, threatening H3.]
;W[ho]C[Your move lets white defend his weakness with a forcing move.]
;B[gm];W[di];B[ci];W[fi];B[dg];W[fg]
(;B[ef]C[This seems a little feeble.

The problem is that you are just moving out, but the way things are, you can't quite get far enough to join up with your stone at G17, and instead just run straight into the white stone at E17.

To move a bit faster, I would rather lean on the white stones C14, and then jump. Of course, this requires a bit of reading to make sure that you can't be cut.]
;W[ff];B[ee];W[fe];B[ed];W[fd];B[dc];W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[fc]
;W[eb]
(;B[de]C[I think that this is a missed opportunity. Doesn't B17 capture some white stones?]

[po][gp][ip][qp][kq][mq][rq][cr][gr][or][sr][cs][gs][ps]C[This is a very defensive move. Is it really necessary. Or, have you counted the score and decided that you are a long way ahead?

White: 9 + 18 + 20 = 47
Black: 41 + 8 + 16 = 65

OK, so you are 15-20 points ahead, so you are allowed to be cautious, but defending the top might have been more important.]
;W[lc]C[Dan: Here's where my real trouble started.  :)  I really didn't know what to do.  I tried to save the stones on the right, but in so doing I damaged the stones on the left so much that they died.  Should I have give up the two to save the three?  Can I reasonably save all five?

Well, what is important? The white sones in the right centre are not necessarily alive, so one day you might be able to attack them. The white group in the top right corner is strong, so you have less to look forward to here. So I think that the three stones are more important than the two. Also, it is smaller for white to capture the two stones, assuming he can. If black can jump to O13, he is nearly connected.]
;B[kd];W[ld]
(;B[ob]C[This is silly, the only move is to hane at M15.

M15 works towards connecting. It means that even if white does capture the two black stones he does so on a very small scale, and it surronds the two white stones, so actually, white might end up captured, not black.]
;W[le]C[Now you are seriously cut. If you were going to go down this road, you should not have played the move at L16.]

(;B[pa]C[This is feeble. The only move worth playing round here is the clamp at R18.]
;W[qb];B[ng];W[mf];B[nf];W[je]
(;B[fb]C[You are only allowed to play moves like this is you have read out that it makes you alive. Otherwise, you should move out into the middle. If you can get between the white groups, then both of them are very weak.]

C[Dan: I finally gave up on all those stones, but it was just too big of a loss I think.

Yes. You really need to think these things through before playing them out. As it is, you just helped white to kill you on a large scale.

The territory is now:

White: 58 + 15 + 17 = 90
Black: 41 + 16 = 57

So you are now quite seriously behind.   If you are going to make any move other than "resign", you are going to have to come up with a plan to attack something. H3 is about the only thing I can see, and I don't think it is big enough.]

You have gained a little in the centre, so if you estimate the score now, you will find that you are about 30 points behind. In 100 moves time, that is the final score. So I think that the only good black move from here on is "resign".]
