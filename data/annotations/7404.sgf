C[Dear reviewer,

I was black . I have tried to study what's big and what's small so i hope it shows in my game. It's hard for me to say where i can improve. I made two big endgame mistakes because of time limit but i think i did pretty good job handling this game.  Now it's your time to prove i was wrong:)]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[od];B[mc];W[kc];B[me];W[hc]

(;B[db]C[This move has no good continuation when W plays c17, because there's no space for making a base to the right side.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[ec];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf]C[now W has gained much influence and you are confined to the corner. His stones are no longer weak.]
;B[eb];W[fb]
(;B[pc]TR[mc][me]C[I'm not sure about this play. I considered pushing white's stone with Q11 but then those two stones might be in danger. Can white play P17 now?]
;W[of];B[oc];W[kf];B[mg]C[good];W[qg];B[cn]C[Afterwards looking this move C9 seems better to me.

maybe, to prevent W from creating a mojo... but c6 is ok I think.]
;W[cl];B[en];W[el];B[bp]C[I think I have found one of your main problems. your instinct here should be to play f4.
attack from the outside instead from the inside. b4 is ok when you have space to slide towards b9.  Same type of mistake as in the upper left corner.]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[br]C[white didn't do very well here];B[fp]C[good.
if W would have played right, you would not have had the chance to play f4]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[fr]
(;B[fl];W[fk];B[gr]C[the exchange f8-f9 is not good if you don't continue there.
and still, better protect with g4.]
(;W[ep];B[fo];W[dr]C[the outcome is good for you. but e4 was too calm.]
;B[qj]C[i tried to give some hard times for white

very good move.];W[pi];B[pj];W[nh]
(;B[mh]C[wrong direction.];W[mi];B[qn]C[not sure about this...
should i still attack white group

hard to attack now, because of your direction mistake I just showed. But you can try. If you continue your attack with m11, the drawback is, that you drive W into your moyo. But on the other hand you gain strength to invade his moyo too.]
;W[lq]C[i think white got here too much
Is O3 better instead of K3 ?

hard to say. you could also try capping with m5... i would prefer that.]
