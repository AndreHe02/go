game, especially as the ladder favors
black.];W[ec];B[ed];W[fd];B[fc];W[gc];B[fb];W[ge];B[gb];W[hd];B[cc];W[df]
;B[cf];W[dg]C[This is now a great result for black.]
(;B[ce]C[runski: It appears to  me that this connection is not required. If
white
cuts, black can follow variation 2. However, not connecting does give black
lots of aji there.
Yes. Black should play elsewhere.];W[nc]L[ic]C[Black B would  destroy whites  upper edge
territory.];B[pf];W[ne]C[This is wrong as  black can
J17];B[ib];W[jc];B[jp]C[K4 good move];W[po];B[qo]C[Black should have played
O4 now. Then white enters at r3 but get a somewhat weak group that will
have to run out in the center. And in this process black can neutralize the
center];W[pp]C[White should try to get light shape here. (It is
difficult :-(. But for instance w R5, b Q4 and w Q8 or P8 will be hard to
attack for black)];B[qp];W[oq];B[pn];W[on]C[This is also difficult, but I  think white has to play
atari at Q3 instead  of P6 to get an easily living group.];B[pm]C[If black
connected at R3 instead, white would become
weak.];W[qq];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[om]C[Overplay. Should be around  M4]
;B[pl]C[Not urgent. Better to
strengthen K4 stone  by peeping with N4 and N5. This would make the white
stones almost useless.
K4 is not a problem by itself, but if it becomes a weak black group, maybe
white can get a large left side and/or a large
center.];W[lp];B[gq];W[ng]C[runski: An excellent move by white.];B[ph]C
[Q17
(or P17) is better than Q12];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]L[pb]C[runski: All the joseki books
show the proper move for white is at 'a'. It seems like black can punish
white's mistake. I didn't know how to do that?];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
;B[oc];W[nb];B[na]C[runski: This seems slow, given the
presence of the marked stone.
It is not slow. White gets in the corner
.];W[re];B[rf];W[sd];B[op]M[hh][ih][jh][kh]C[runski: I was thinking of a shallow
invasion around the marked area. Be fore I could do that, I wanted to
settle my only weak group (bottom 2 stones).
I tried to sacarfice the p4 stone to reach this goal, but it didn't work.
Yes. One way to add help to the 2 stones on lower edge can be to jump out
around M9 or N9. That also increases the aji around N5 and also helps a
later invasion at around X.];W[oo];B[np];W[mq];B[lo]C[Aji keshi. Just F5 is enough]
;W[mo];B[kp];W[kq];B[mp];W[lq];B[mn];W[no];B[jq];W[ko];B[jo];W[kn];B[fo]
;W[dm];B[im];W[jn];B[in];W[kl];B[km]C[Black has  now around 65 points. White has not many points but
a lot of potential. I think black should just continue to jump into the
center with J8 (or possibly k8). Even if white b13 the game is even or
slightly better for black.];W[jm];B[jl];W[lm];B[ik];W[ii];B[bp]L[kk]
[ki][dj]C[Not
correct. It is risky and will at least end up as gote. Black should do
something about center.
Maybe first b A, w defends and black gets in the center along L line? Or
maybe black tries with C?];W[cq]C[Good for white];B[ji]C[Wrong. Should start with  L9]
;W[jj];B[ij];W[jk];B[hi];W[ih];B[il]L[ni]C[runski: Is  this slow? Black can fight the
ko. 'a' looks big.

I think J8 is necessary.];W[ni];B[hh];W[ig]C[I think black can
cut at K9 instead :-)];B[nk];W[qg]C[Good move for white];B[pg];W[qf];B[pe]

;W[br];B[cn];W[cm];B[ar];W[eo];B[ol]C[runski: The lower left group isn't alive yet. I  was too eager to
play h ere.

Yes. Black C2 bigger.];W[ln];B[ml];W[cr];B[bm];W[bl];B[cl];W[dl];B[ck];W
[bn];B[bk];W[am];B[bh];W[bi];B[ci];W[ch];B[bj];W[bg];B[ai];W[cg]C[Black D10  would be much
better.];B[ak];W[be];B[bd];W[bf];B[cd];W[hr];B[kr]L[jr]C[runski: Wouldn't 'a' be better?

Yes I agree H2 is much better. As played the base of the black group is taken
away.];W[ir];AB[jr];W[gr];B[hq];W[dj];B[cj];W[go];B[fq];W[fr];B[fn];W[fp]

[dn];B[dr];W[bo];B[gm]L[ds]C[runski: I missed the cut at 'a' completely during the
game. Since black
was behind, I think this cut is the only move.

Black D1 answered by white G7 looks good for white as black has fewer
liberties, so I think black G7 is only
move.];W[ds];B[fj]C[Black F10 seems bad. Black E10 looks
promising, or G10  safer.];W[gk];B[fk]C[Black should probably play F12. The
sequence that follows in the game is bad for black, as most moves does not
work very well.

But the problems started when white took away the base of blacks group and
it is easy to go wrong in this fighting.];W[gi];B[fh];W[fi];B[ei];W[gh]
;B[gg];W[eh];B[fg];W[di];B[hg];W[ej];B[if];W[jg]C[White L12 is better shape.]
;B[jf];W[kg];B[he];W[ie];B[id];W[ic]C[White should cut at J14
instead. Then the game seems lost for black.];B[je]C[Now a lot of strange
moves from both sides follows. It seems very hard for black to live.

But it is difficult to comment on different moves in a running fight like
this.];W[jd];B[le];W[lc]C[White N16 leaves less aji.];B[ld];W[lb];B[nd]
