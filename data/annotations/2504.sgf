C[Hi. 

I'm going to review your game, trying to focus on easy things. I'll try to answer your questions, but will also add comments on whatever I think is important.

BTW, I'll begin my comments with pajaro. You can find me in IGS with that nick.]
;B[dd];W[qd];B[pq];W[cp]
(;B[fc]C[pajaro: This is not very good. When you play 3-3 or 4-4, you are supposed to already be controlling the corner. As you have a stone in a 3-4 point (Q3) you could make a shimari there. when you play 4-4, you must not be thinking in territory, but in strength. W can still invade at 3-3, so F17 doesn't give much profit.]
;W[jc]C[pajaro: The same applies for W. He doesn't want B to get the upper side, so he extends. But this is still move 6. He could make a shimari a P17 or E3. Also, B is strong on the left. Remeber to not play near the strength. Near self stregth=overconcentration, enemy strength=danger.]
;B[cj]C[pajaro: For the left side, it is OK. But you could still make a shimari, or a kakari against W in E3.]
;W[qj]C[pajaro: The same. I'd play shmari or kakari first.
Also, notice what happened. The usual is corner, then sides then center. In this game, all four corners were ocuppied. Then black reinforce a corner that didn't need to, and then both players forgot the non-sttled cornes and went for the sides.]
;B[qn];W[jq]C[I think I did badly in the opening. Territorial framework is alot less than white's.

pajaro: Basically, you forgot the right order in the opening.]
;B[lq];W[gq];B[kr]C[pajaro: This is a mistake. What are you trting to get with this? Did you expect W K2? Also a mistake. This doesn't make you stronger, either helps an attacked group. It's a yose (endgame) point. Not worth yet.]
;W[jj]C[Why does white take the center point now?

pajaro: Because it's big. Now, he controls the UR area. In some way, it also connects his two positions and cuts yours. Maybe your question should be "why doesn't w play K2?". See my other comment.]

(;B[jr]C[I used this to attack white's position. Is it necessary?

pajaro: You are not attacking. What's the danger for w? He can just play J2, or even play elsewhere. This isn't a position worth defending.
Consider also the importance of C7. See vars.]
(;W[iq]C[pajaro: White defends. Well, although I would have played C7, w is building thickness toward the center. Thanks to b.]
;B[cm]C[pajaro: Good. Think about this before next time ;)]
;W[cf]C[Invasion already?

pajaro: W is ahead, so he shouldn't be taking risks. This might be good for B. How? Attack this stone and make him run towards the center. There, B will be strong and invade/reduce W's moyo.]

(;B[ce]C[pajaro: Don't touch what you are attacking. Maybe C12 better. See var]
;W[ch];B[bf]C[pajaro: Again, B is playing underneath, tryin to steal W's base. But W can't make two eyes on the side, so he will have to run to the center. Chase him! Play E11, for example. Push from your weak side towards your strong one.]

(;W[cg]C[pajaro: Mistake for W. This won't make you alive in the side. Run to the center. Don't stop to save every single stone.]
;B[be]C[Protecting against the cut point.

pajaro: Cut? W can't cut there. B just plays B16 and captures.]
;W[bi];B[bj]C[Protection of self.

pajaro: A pity, but this could be necessary for B. W invades B's framework, and now B sees himself defending.]
;W[nc]C[pajaro: W assumes that he is safe, and goes for cash. This is the time for B to attack.]
;B[hc]C[pajaro: This is such a narrow extension. Attack the C13 group, or nvade at E4, or... always try yo look at all the board. Don't follow your opponent blindly.]
;W[jf];B[ql]C[pajaro: Again. W plays a big point, and you play a narrow extendion. Also, the chance of attacking is vanishing.]
;W[pj]C[pajaro: Although this is strong, jumping to P10 is also safe and bigger.]
;B[ok];W[oj]C[pajaro: With this last exchange, B has just helped W to make his moyo stronger.]
;B[pk]C[pajaro: If you had to fight here, you should play O9. But now, you must leave this side of the board. The only one taking profit is W.]
;W[nk]C[pajaro: Good. Hane at the head of two stones. This is why B should have played there before.]
;B[nl];W[mk];B[ml];W[ll];B[lm];W[km]
(;B[ln]C[Continuing to build my territory.

pajaro: Continuing to help W build his territory. Also, as you are here, you could do better. See var.]
;W[kn];B[lo];W[ko];B[kp];W[jp];B[lp]C[pajaro: Why?? W can't cut. If he ataris, just connect, but not before. Should W play L3 now? Of course not. B has wasted another move.]
;W[dj]C[pajaro: Now, W has overwheelming strength. He can do whatever he wants. But this isn't the right point. I should jump to E13 first, and then attack B. First make sure you aren't weak.]
;B[dk];W[ej];B[ek];W[fj];B[co];W[do];B[cn];W[fn];B[dp]C[Crosscutting to try and fight for bottom left.]
;W[eo];B[cq];W[bp];B[bq];W[dq];B[ep];W[fp];B[eq];W[er];B[dr]
;W[fq];B[dq];W[fk];B[em];W[he]C[pajaro: Again, W takes the big points.]
;B[id];W[kd];B[rj];W[ri]C[pajaro: why not just S9 and take that stone?]
;B[rk];W[ni];B[fm];W[gm];B[jb];W[kb];B[ib];W[fe];B[ef]C[I think this was a bad move.

pajaro: Yes. You want to reduce. But as you can't live there by yourself, you need to be connected to your groups. D14, for example.]
;W[ee];B[de];W[df]C[pajaro: If W can cut, you lose your stone.]
;B[gd];W[ge];B[si];W[rh];B[ci];W[di];B[bh];W[bg];B[ai]C[Trying to attack that position to break the really big center framework white has.]
;W[ag];B[af]C[pajaro: No need for that. If W plays A14, you can play A13. You just saved 1 point. Go for bigger moves. L19, T12.]
;W[fl];B[el]C[pajaro: Again, W can't capture.];W[en];B[dn];W[ir]

;B[sh];W[sg];B[sj];W[rg]C[pajaro: Ok. B has taken some points and still plays.]
;B[fd]C[pajaro: A12 better.];W[kc];B[hd]C[pajaro: No. This is dame.  Play J17]
;W[ic];B[hb];W[eg];B[ah];W[rm]C[Why does white attack here? It looks like she already won.]
;B[qk];W[qm];B[pm];W[qp];B[rp];W[rq];B[ro]C[Don't want to let white join.

pajaro: Good.];W[qq];B[qr];W[pr];B[or];W[pp];B[ps];W[pn];B[po]
;W[on];B[om]C[pajaro: Danger at R5. If W cuts, he will take one B stone.]
;W[oq];B[pr];W[qo];B[rn]
(;W[nq]C[pajaro: I'm not sure, but I think W should capture. May be his only chance, although I think he can't live.]
;B[oo];W[nr]C[Race for life begins, I think.];B[op];W[rr];B[rs]
C[Taking the 1-2 point to create an eye.

pajaro: R1 is not an eye!];W[os]C[pajaro: Mistake. This will lead to a double-ko. White can't capture B now.]
;B[ns]
(;W[ms];B[sq]C[Black won the race.

pajaro: Yes, but W could have done better.];W[gn]C[pajaro: No need for this.]
;B[ap]C[Wasted move.

pajaro: Yes, W is already dead.];W[ff]C[Wasted move.

pajaro: Yes.

pajaro: Well, that's all. In order to improve, I would just gice you two advices:
1- Don't follow your opponent everywhere. Try to play elsewhere after he plays. Try to keep the initiative (sente) in the game.
2- Try to evaluate the need to defense, and the chance to attack. Every wasted move here is a chance for the opponent to take sente himself.

The best is to play all as possible. You can also watch (and play) games in IGS or KGS to get a feeling of how a game develops. It hasn't to be from strong players, but just a bit stronger than you.]
