;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ed]C[I used to play the 5-4 a lot, but I play it a lot less now. I imagine it leads to fighting?        i don't think there's anything wrong with this, though what follows may    not be the best use of its possibilities. I see a stone there looking to    the right side, with the flexibility to move back and take a large    corner, or block black into the corner with a wall facing w lower left    4-4 stone - that's probably why b plays his approach to the outside. you    end up making influence toward the right side just as the position of 4    suggests, but then because you choose the lower star point black gets to    play the upper one, reducing this influence...]
;B[ce]C[This is not good, I think..

do you mean 5 or a?

5 doesn't seem that bad to me - b wants to be sure you don't make a big
enclosure at the top that will be hard to approach, and he doesn't want
to be closed in (though he is eventually).];W[cd]LB[cc:A]C[...but neither is this?



i guess 'a' is possible, too. you don't come out of this too badly though.]
;B[dd];W[de]C[I suppose I could have taken the corner instead.



the advantage in that (it seems to me) is that he would have to extend

down from his stones (the two that are there plus b 8) and you would have

sente, perhaps to play something preventing the 3-stone enclosure of the

right side that happens in the game.];B[dc];W[ec];B[cc];W[bd]
;B[bc];W[cf];B[be];W[bf];B[ad];W[ef];B[pk]TR[md][nd]C[ i might be tempted to play to the upper right here... but who

knows.];W[jp];B[jd];W[no]LB[pn:A]C[This move is Nie Weiping's counter to the chinese opening. I liked it, but I'm not sure if it works here.



entering a large enclosure like this is always tricky, for me anyway.

I've never tried this particular move before, but it doesn't seem bad. I

might have tried a.];B[nq];W[po];B[qp];W[qo];B[rp];W[np]C[This is not good :(



exchange of 28 for 29 doesn't get you much.];B[mq];W[nc];B[nd]

;W[oc];B[ne];W[pc];B[qd];W[qc];B[rd];W[lc];B[ph]LB[lo:A]C[ i think he gave

you a break here, playing slowly at 41. with 41 at 'a' for instance i think

he could have made his upper right territory in sente while building

thickness to use against your left.  or 41 at a.];W[le];B[fe]

C[ with

your stones coming out at the top, this move isn't as useful for him as

it

could have been.];W[nk]C[I figured I was behind so I left two weak groups on the board.]
