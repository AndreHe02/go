C[iguana: Hi!

Hi Julian,

I am a 3k on KGS, hope you will find my review useful!

;B[qd];W[pe];B[rf];W[og];B[qk]C[T: Black is being extremely greedy.  This invasion is really deep and you can definitely inflict some pain.  Remember you are trying to block B in and use your walls to make some territory.  If you let him escape too easily, you will have missed out.]

(;W[qm]TR[qn][rn][sn][qo][ro][so]C[T: This is letting off B really easy.  He can escape super easily now!  You have earned about 6 points for yourself at move 22, most inefficient!  Check variation.]
;B[ok]
(;W[oi]C[T: This is an extremely slow move, making you about 2 points and a bit of influence.  Check variation.]
;B[mk];W[mm];B[kd]C[T: Good direction by B.];W[pk]C[I know this cut was a bad choice. I misread and concluded that I could cut off the stone on the 3rd line.

T: I do believe that is exactly what you did! The cost was a bit of damage to your top right group...]
;B[pj];W[pl];B[oj];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj]C[T: Tadaah!  Cut off!]
;B[ri];W[rk];B[pi]TR[fc][cf][cj][cn][fq]C[T: All of the marked moves are better than your response at Q12, which is very passive.]
;W[ph]C[T: Didn't turn out so bad, but this move is about 6 or 7 points and gote!  There are definitely more important moves on the board, like starting to destroy B influence!]
;B[rh];W[fc]TR[cf][cn]C[Here I was not sure how to react to L16. I did not want to let the influence of my wall at Q17 vanish, so I started an attack on the top left corner, hoping to make use of my wall.

T: I don't think your idea is bad.  I would prefer to play this at the marked stones and reduce influence later.  However, your group at Q15 is starting to look really weak.  Technically, you should fix it first.

Remember your priorities:
1. Fix my weak groups
2. Attack enemy weak groups
3. Make territory];B[ec]C[T: Kick is really good!];W[fd];B[df]
;W[jc]C[T: Making contact with black will only strengthen him and make your wall weaker.  I would rathe play this at J17 and attack L16 or approach the other corner.]
;B[kc];W[jd];B[ke];W[mc];B[qb];W[pb];B[nd];W[md];B[me];W[ne]
;B[nf];W[oe]C[T: B is very kind!];B[mf];W[mh]C[T: Not too bad, but I think you are trying to split two strong groups.  If black were to play here, you can respond by bringing out your H16 group and negating any wall influence.]
;B[je]C[T: This is creating more harmful influence, while simultaneously attacking your H16 group.]
;W[ie];B[if];W[he];B[jb];W[kb];B[lb];W[ib]C[T: There is a proverb for this: "Don't play 1, 2, 3... just play 3!"  I.e. play this instead of L18.]
;B[ka];W[hc]TR[ck][cn][fq][jq]C[T: You could probably get away without this.  A move on the side is much bigger, I think.]
;B[mb];W[nb];B[lc];W[nc];B[ma];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[cj]
;B[bo];W[ch];B[cg];W[bg];B[bf];W[dg];B[cf];W[bh]C[T: I think you should block on the other side at D12, since B is already alive.  Except for preventing eyes on groups, blocking a lone threatened stone like B13 in gote is not big.]
;B[dh];W[eg];B[eh];W[bn]C[T: This is pretty big];B[fh];W[ff]
;B[hh];W[hq]C[T: Good timing!  I would also look at K3, since B is not alive yet.]
;B[gq];W[jq];B[kq];W[er]C[T: This is a bridge too far... B can just play G2 and split you!]

(;B[eq]C[T: Luckily B is scared!  This is a HUGE concession.]
;W[gr];B[dr];W[fr];B[jr];W[ir];B[jp];W[gp];B[fq];W[iq];B[kr]
;W[go]C[T: B can just cut at H4?]
(;B[hs];W[is];B[jn];W[io];B[jo];W[pr];B[os]C[T: E10 is starting to look good!  F5 also seems nice, but B can easily counter the wall with moves around E9.]
;W[or];B[nr]C[T: Up to here you have evened the game out quite a bit against all odds!  Good work!]
;W[hm]C[T: This move feels like you don't know that to do next.  You should always just come up with some plan and play it!  Never just play a move for no really good reason.]
;B[dl]C[This move was my problem. I did not know how to react. It seems like too deep an invasion and playing C8 felt submissive. On the other hand, trying to catch the stone did not work out at all...

T: I think you have to be able to catch this stone!  It is definitely too deep!  This is just begging for E10.]
;W[ek]C[T: Contact is risky.  Typically it is better to smother your opponent instead of crushing him.  E10 would be better.]
;B[el];W[fk];B[fl];W[fn]C[T: It is unfortunate that C6 is vulnerable, otherwise B would be dead!]
;B[gl];W[gi]
(;B[fg]C[T: This fight would be easier if E9 was at E10!];W[ij]
C[T: Your stones are too weak to fight the very strong wall that was created by the contact.]
;B[gk]
(;W[gj]C[T: I think you should rather play the empty triangle!  F12 is still not fully connected.]
;B[ik];W[il];B[hk];W[jk];B[hj];W[hi];B[ii];W[jj];B[dk];W[ei]
C[T: I think the result of the game is pretty much set here.  I think you should try to always make sure that a move is truly necessary.  Each move must have a clear meaning for you.  This will help to make your stones more efficient!

I hope my review was helpful!  Thanks for the opportunity!]
;B[dj];W[di];B[fi];W[bl]C[Here I accepted that I could not fend off his invasion and connected before I lose everything.

T: Good!];B[ej];W[ci];B[ps];W[qs];B[ns];W[rr];B[ef];W[ih]C[I think atari from the other side (at K11) would have been better!]

(;W[ok]TR[pc][pe][og][oi]C[T: I would go for a big wall by forcing black to live small.  The difference is that your wall can be extended as marked, while you don't really lose too much territory in the corner as compared to the move in the game.  Now you have to use this wall to make some territory!]
