C[Hello reviewer. I'm BrunoA, 1d on kgs. My opponent is also 1d.

In some point of the game, I felt I was really ahead, but then the game was really close, and I dont' know where things changed so much. If you can show me where I did wrong, I wil be very grateful.

Review for black. But if you can also show some mistakes from my opponent, it'll be very nice. Thank you.]

;B[ef];W[gd];B[dg];W[cm]C[I guess this move of him should be at o17, so I played there.

klin: W C7 acceptable.  O17 is also good.];B[oc]C[Here I wanted to play thick. Maybe that's too slow?

klin: O17 better];W[po];B[np]C[I'm not sure if this is the right direction since I played p17. I thought in the pincer, but I was wanting to get sente so I could make the next big move.

klin: O4 OK];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[ql]LB[gq:B][dq:C][qh:A]
C[Now I had sente, but I wasn't sure of what to play next.

A, B and C were the points I wanted to play, is there a big diiference in one of them? Or maybe another point?

KLin: Your choice of C is not bad.  A and B are in-between moves.  A can be R13, B can be F3.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr];B[ep];W[do];B[hp]C[Until here I think the game is quite even. But then he started a fight that hurted my O4 group. How could I have avoided that?

klin: H4 OK, but J3 may be better.  Now W has an obvious invasion point at K3.]
;W[jq]LB[iq:C][jp:A][jo:B]C[This move seems bad for white. And I thought in those three ways of attacking that stone. I choosed A because again I wanted sente so I could play on the right side, but things come up baddly, and I had to run with my O4 group.

klin: The invasion itself is not bad.  It is the timing: too early. S15 or R13 is a possible move now.]
;B[jp]C[klin: J3 is better than K4];W[kp];B[iq]C[klin: This is the worst move so far. K5 is only move.  It is not easy to attack W due to K4.]
;W[jo];B[ip];W[ko]C[klin: Now B 7 stones all cramp in a small area.  W is outside and comfortable.]
;B[kq];W[lq];B[jr];W[mp]LB[nq:A][no:B]C[I thought in playing A so i could connect my two groups. But I thought this would be too submissive, so I played B, but then my group was atacked. Where I did wrong so things came up like this?]
;B[no];W[nq];B[op]C[klin: B is painful.  It is all J3's fault.]
;W[rr];B[rs];W[sr];B[nr]C[klin: O2 at N2 better];W[mr];B[nm]
;W[kl];B[lm];W[km];B[mj]C[klin: N10 looks faster, but O9 gives better shape.]
;W[ok];B[nk]C[Maybe this is bad?

klin: Now let's reverse the order.  If B plays O9 first, when W play at P9, will B play at N10?  O9 should be O8]
;W[oj]C[klin: W O10 comfortable, B N10 at an odd position.]
;B[kj];W[hn];B[ol];W[kr]C[klin: W L2 too much];B[fn];W[gl];B[qm]
;W[rm];B[qn];W[pm];B[pn];W[on];B[pl];W[rn]C[klin: At this point, B should R9]
;B[om]C[klin: Now W should play at R9 and B gains very little.]
;W[qo];B[qk];W[pm]C[My plann worked out really nice here, and I was able to disconnet his two stones. This is the point of the game where I think I was better. But then I just loosed control.
Where did this happen?];B[mo];W[qj]C[klin: W R9 should  R11.  Trying to save P9 P10 is meaningless.]
;B[rl];W[qm];B[pk];W[qe]C[klin: Now you can see R11 is better than R10.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[rj]C[klin: W S10 should be reserved];B[rk]
;W[rf];B[sd];W[se];B[re];W[pj];B[sf]C[klin: Q10 is a very bad move.  Now B really leads.]
;W[mi];B[li];W[mh];B[lg]LB[ck:C][qf:A][lc:B]C[What about this move? I thought in just playing a big point such as A,  B and C, so the game would be easy. But I wanted to keep the pressure on his group, and make my group stronger.

klin: From attacking point of view, this is a good move.
klin: B lower-right group's connection is not secured.  W does not have time to do anything now.  But it is a potential threat.]
;W[lk];B[lj];W[ml];B[nl];W[nf];B[lc]C[klin: M17 is a slow move. B should play at S13.  W has to flee from, for example N15, then B can ply M17, or more agressively L15 to keep attacking.]
;W[qf]C[Here I still think I was a lot ahead.

klin: W is not alive yet. Q14 is the attacking point];B[lo]
;W[jq];B[fl]C[Since I got sente, I could help my other group, is this the best way or I should just make a base?

klin: This is OK.  It was L2's fault that W center group becomes weak.]
;W[nj];B[mk];W[gk];B[gm]C[klin: G7 is a typical bad move. It looks like a sente, but accomplish nothing but help W.]
;W[hm];B[fk];W[gj];B[ck]C[I taked another big point.];W[mm]
;B[ln];W[ll];B[nn];W[lh];B[kh];W[kg];B[jg]C[klin: B K13 should K12.]
;W[kf];B[lp]C[klin: M4 should be reserved.];W[kq];B[ji]C[After m13 dies, things felt a lot different.

klin: Now W group is secured.  If B attack at Q14 first, W does not have time to cut at L13.  W may have to play at M14 to help B become stronger.]

Black has about 57 points.
And White about 50 plus komi.

The game was still really close. But since I had the felling I was ahead by so many points in the earlier game, I can't be happy with that, so I just resigned.

Thank you very much.]))
