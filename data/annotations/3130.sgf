C[Hello!

I play black in this game, and i lost by 2.5 points. Looking back over the game i can't see any major mistakes... so i'm hoping you'll find them for me ^_^.

btw, when you are refering to perticular stones, could you please use it's coordinates and not it's move number. I find it much easier to find the move that you are indicating this way. Thx.

Thanks in advance for this reveiw. =)];B[pe];W[dp];B[de]C[Recently I've been trying out some 5-4 5-4 openings, either intending to make shimaris early on, or leaving them so as to to entice my opponent to invade so that i can get influence.]
;W[pp];B[pc];W[fd];B[dc]C[My feeling is that W F16 almost forces me to make a shimari... which I was happy to do, so I think that it wasn't a good move (at least, i can't understand it).

Agreed.  This exchange is good for black.];W[id];B[lc]C[This move is slow.  The right and left sides are bigger, since there are opposing stones on the 4th line, and the area is wider. Your move at M17 is too far away to have much affect one white. Your stone at D17 is already closer to the edge, making it hard for white to get eyes here, so it is redundant to do it again from the other side.]
;W[qg]C[This move is good, playing on one of the big sides.  It is better to play on this side, since a play on the other side might lead to making black thicker so black could attack the stones at F16.]
;B[qf]C[I wasn't sure on how to respond to W R13. I ended up playing R14 (to protect the corner, i gues :S), but that still leaves the weakness at R16 :(.

My other though was to pincer the stone... looking back i like this option better, especially in light of way the game turned out (the entire side became white territory).

So a pincer around R11 is a better response?

A pincer is better.  This diagonal move to defend territory is almost always wrong early in the game.  This move would be ok if it was part of a plan to make white heavier so you could attack him.  In that case you would have to play around Q10 next.]
;W[pg]
(;B[nq]C[This move should be at Q10.  Now that you have given him a small two stone wall, you don't want to help him build up the right side.  You would rather be attacking those two stones.  If they cooperate and run into the center you might find a double attack against the stones at the top.]
;W[pn];B[jp];W[qk];B[fq]C[hmmm... this looks good for me... should white have prevented this, with R9 elsewhere?

Your shape on the lower side is ideal, but white has made a big gain on the right side in compensation.  I like R9.]
;W[cn];B[dr]C[This move is unusual.  With this move on the board, you would normally have a stone at J3 or H4, not K4, so it makes a strange shape.]
;W[cq];B[ci]C[Good.  A play on the big side.];W[pr]C[Very big for white.]
;B[no]C[And sente for white.];W[nc]C[This invasion seems like an overplay by white, and i ended up capuring this stone, but i didn't like the outcome becuase  white got a nice wall, and setting up a for a good moyo with 07 later.

Was N16 any good? Look at this now O15 looks alright even if it means i have to sacrifice the M17 stone.

This was not a good invasion for white.  I would prefer to invade the lower side or extend at C9 to stabilize the lower left corner and aim at a later invasion at C13, or play o7 to expand white's territory.]
;B[md];W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[le];W[mf];B[od];W[nf];B[oe];W[kd]
;B[ld];W[nm]C[White has a nice moyo :(

Yes.  A direct result of the earlier play at O3.  The stones at Q13 should have been a target for yor attack, but they ended up being part of a large territory.  You gave white the right side in exchange for the bottom, but the side is looking bigger.]
;B[lf]C[i want to attack the 3 white stones, so i seperate them from white's right side.

This is also good because it prevents further expansion of the white territory.]
;W[mh];B[jc];W[ic];B[fb];W[jb];B[kc]
(;W[jd]C[I don't like this white move.  The stone at L16 is not important. If the purpose is to prepare to jump in the center, it would be better to just jump.]
;B[hb];W[ib]
(;B[if]C[A move like f14 would have been better, as it works with the c11 stone too, letting me secure territory, white white finds eyes?


F14 is much better since it expands the territory on the left side.  When you attack you should always look to see what else the attacking stones will do for you.  There is no hope to capture this group, so your moves must have a second purpose.

F14 is also better since you should attack by playing on the side away from your strength.  Your stones at M14 are much stronger than your stone at D15, so you should play nearer to D15.]
;W[ge]
(;B[gf]C[This is a bad move.  An important go principle is to touch stones when defending, and don't touch enemy stones when attacking. When you touch a stone like this, it makes that stone stronger, and you don't want white to get stronger.

F14 is somewhat better, since it takes terrotory on the left, but it also helps white expand on the right, since it is also a contact play.

G13 is consistent with your previous move, but it pushes white into your potential territory.]
;W[ff];B[he];W[hd];B[gg];W[fg];B[gh];W[fh]C[Now white has a nice wall that he can use to invade the left side, so the left side territory is gone.  Go to the end of the game and look at the left side.  It should be balck territory, gained during this attack.  J14 and G14 gave it all away.]
;B[cl];W[fi];B[ee];W[fe];B[gc];W[gd]C[anyway, i'm happy here, white has a groups that still lacks eyes, i decide to secure the bottom now... should i have kept on attacking? In what direction?

I would not be happy here.  The left side needs another move, and white is out.  Your move at C8 let him get ahead in the pushing sequence in the center, so now he will be hard to attack further.

I would attack the lower left corner and find a way to split the two weak groups.  White did not answer your move at C8, so that group is weak now.]

(;B[fn]C[This move is also good.  It expands your moyo and attacks both white groups.

Or you could play at H10 to drive the weak groups closer before separating them.]
;W[gj]
(;B[ii]C[This move is a strange shape.  You are attacking white, so don't be so submissive.]
;W[ij]
(;B[ji]C[You should hane here.  He is pushing you around, and you must resist.  You need sente to play c2.]
;W[cr];B[jj];W[ik]C[At this pint you would rather have the stone at K11 be at L11.]
;B[mj]C[Good];W[oi];B[oj];W[pi];B[ol];W[pm]C[seems to me like white's last three moves where a bit passive...

Yes.  You made a very good sente reduction.]
(;B[ml]C[This move is slow though.  If you are worried about being cut at O9, you can defend in sente, then cut at p7.]
;W[nn];B[mo];W[ln]C[This is a mistake, since black can cut it off.]
;B[mn];W[mm];B[lm];W[ll];B[km];W[lj];B[lk];W[kl];B[kk];W[jl]
;B[kn]C[Good sequence for black.  This makes up some of the loss on the left side.]
;W[li]C[This white move is slow, since M10 is not a cutting stone.  Better to invade the left side.]

(;B[lg]C[Wasted move?

Yes.  You need to defend the left side at D12, which is very large.

In this game you have a tendency to follow your opponent around the board.  This move was played in response to M11, but is not needed to defend your group.  He can cause a little damage, but he can't capture you.

If this move is at D12, you will win by a large margin.];W[ch]

(;B[dh]C[i played this hane, but would extending to D11 have been better? D11 also limits white's opertunities to get eyes?]
;W[di]
(;B[cg]C[Usually it is better to extend from a crosscut, unless you intend to sacrifice a stone.

Playing at d13 is much better.];W[bh];B[dg];W[cj]
(;B[dj]C[The atari from the other side is not any better.];W[ei]
;B[ck];W[bj];B[dm];W[dk]
(;B[do]C[This move and the next one don't help you any, and just make white stronger.

Playing at d6 is the easy to way to connect and keep sente.]
;W[co];B[ep];W[dq]
(;B[er]C[You need to connect your stones above, although it gives up a lot of points on the bottom.]
;W[dn]
(;B[en]C[White is thick now, not weak, so you have to play carefully here. You can't allow the cut at e7.  You can play at e7 to connect.]
;W[eo]C[White should just cut now.  This gives you another chance to save your stones.]

(;B[fo];W[em];B[fm];W[el];B[fl];W[fk]C[This not good for black.  White has gained over 20 points on the left edge.  With sente, you gain almost as much at the bottom. The game is close now.  You are ahead and can win with a good endgame.]
;B[or]C[Good.  this is big.];W[oq];B[op];W[pq];B[po]C[This move is not good.  It is worth 3 points in gote (r5, q5, and o4).  There are much bigger moves, like B13, or O2, or L18, or S13, all worth over 5 points.

In the endgame it is important to make sente moves first, then reverse sente (where your opponent has sente), then big gote moves.  NAd don't look just near his last move.

Moves on the second line, like o2 and s13, are much bigger than they look.]
;W[qo];B[oo];W[nr]C[This move is much bigger.  Since black answers, it's about 8 points in sente, or the same as 16 points in gote.]
;B[mr];W[os];B[lq];W[in];B[io];W[jn];B[jo]
(;W[bg]C[This is a mistake.  White should play A15 or B14.]
;B[bf];W[af];B[be];W[ae];B[ad];W[ag];B[bd];W[ma];B[mb];W[ka]
;B[na];W[lb]C[Another mistake.  Should be M19.

Still, white got three big sente endages in a row.  Black should have taken one instead of Q5.]
;B[kb];W[rg];B[rf];W[sf];B[se];W[sg];B[rd];W[jf];B[jg];W[kf]
;B[kg];W[eq];B[fp]C[NO reason not to take the ko at D5.  Let white use a ko threat to force you to play here.]
;W[ds];B[fs];W[hn];B[jm]C[Silly by me... i know...

Look for sente or big :)  This move and your last one are both gote and small.

If you play bigger moves in the endgame you can easily pick up 10 points per game, and that's worth one rank.

Again it seems that you are only looking for moves near his last move rather than looking at the whole board.]
;W[im];B[lo];W[gl];B[gm]C[Another small gote.];W[ho];B[hp];W[hm]
;B[jk];W[il];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi];W[lh];B[pj];W[qj]
(;B[pl]C[should have played O8, yeah? So easy to be wise after the event :P

Yes, it saves 3 points, and you can still play Q8 later.  Everything else is small, so this your last chance to win.]

In summary, your major mistakes were:

Playing at the top in the opening, rather than on the right or left side, which were bigger.

Attacking the weak white group at the top from the wrong side, leading to the loss of a lot of territory on the left side.

Missing the big endgame points.

Each of these is easy to change your thinking, and you will be come much stronger.]
