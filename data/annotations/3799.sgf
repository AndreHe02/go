C[Llywelyn:  That you won by such a significant amount means that there isn't going to be much to learn from this game.  I've tried to label a few points for improvement, but there was no way to analyze any consistent patterns in your play that you can learn from.

If you have any questions about the review, please don't hesitate to email me.]
;B[pd];W[po]LB[pp:B][qp:A]C[Llywelyn: This is unusual.  It is a fair opening, emphasizing influence, but I think you'll have more luck with either the 3-4 point (A) or the 4-4 point (B).]
;B[de];W[ep];B[og]TR[dc][cp][pq]C[Llywelyn: This move is akward and doesn't accomplish much for black.  Approaching the unbalanced corners is more critical.]
DO[];W[qk]LB[dc:A][cp:B][cq:C]C[Llywelyn: I'd approach at A, or perhaps take advantage of one of my own 5-4 points.]

;B[df];W[fi]C[Llywelyn: Pretty solid position, it leaves you with good outer influence, but I think B ends up better for it because of  all of the territory and strong position in the NW.   It should be noted that an approach move is still possible around D17.]
;B[bi]TR[ff]C[Llywelyn: Other side seems more important for B.]
;W[bj];B[ah];W[bk];B[aj];W[ak]C[Llywelyn: Small.];B[ai];W[jg]
TR[fd][fe]C[Llywelyn: Invasion or more of a reduction is also possible.]
;B[ge];W[mi]LB[mh:A]TR[jg]C[Llywelyn: A is stronger with respect to the marked stone.  This seems to want to block all of black's stones at once, but doesn't work well with any of white's other stones.]

(;B[cp]C[Llywelyn: Difficult so deep in W's territory, 3-3 is more typical.  Still, no immediate surrounding stones, so not bad.  This is one reason the 5-4 point can be difficult to work with and needs to be defended at some point.]
