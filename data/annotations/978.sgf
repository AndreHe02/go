C[This is perhaps not the ideal situation to play a pincer with a white 3-3 invasion possible. But I am too weak to give a good alternative. It is playable as a compromise.]

[oj:c]MA[nc][fc]C[A move at 'a' is not as heavy as it seems because 'b' and 'c' become miai. The move played build thickness in a part of the bord where black is very strong already and the white marked stones are also strong, so I think 'a' or a more indirect approach with a play in the lower right corner (R3?)  is better.]

[ho:g][fr:h][lr:i][mq:j][ks:k]C[What about this exchange, from 'a' to 'h' - if then white plays 'i' white cannot play 'j' because of lack of liberties. It feels that white has played somewhat unreasonably and should suffer somehow. I do not if this sequence is good, but it could be an alternative.]
;W[js];B[hp]LB[gp:a][gq:b]C[I think 'a' or 'b' is better, removing some bad aji.  This atari does not capture the white stone securely so it is very inefficient.]
;W[mq];B[op];W[oq];B[mp];W[gq];B[gp];W[fq];B[es]LB[cs:a][er:b]
C[Black gets away for the moment, but the aji is still very bad, and white can play 'a' in sente threatening 'b'.]
;W[om];B[oo]LB[qp:a]MA[op]C[Looks very clumsy. What about playing lightly with 'a' instead? It has a territorial value, beginnings of some eyeshape and it looks good. The marked stone is not important, the best that could happen is if white tries to cut it of so that you can sacrifice it efficently.]

;W[if];B[ne]LB[nd:a]C[A move at 'a' , would connect all the black stones, the move played removes one liberty from one unimportant white stone. If white had played 'a' trying to connect and insure the cut then it would be natural to play this move. Now white 'a' is optional, that is white can play elsewhere. It feels like white gains almost one whole  move here.]
;W[hd];B[le];W[kf];B[mf]C[Now black has spent two moves to connect into a group that has about 3 eyes and even two more potential eyes and... no territory! The black plays here has been very inefficient.]
;W[gf];B[ge];W[fe];B[gd]MA[hd][op]C[This is how forcing moves should be treated, sacrifice them and run away with the important stones. Compare this to what happened to P4.]
;W[hc]C[Hmm, the "sacrifice" was a trap! That just proves how good it is to play lightly!]
;B[fd];W[hb];B[jb]LB[ib:a]C[Here you should play at 'a' and remve a liberty from the white stones. I lost a game because of this myself once and will never forget it.]
;W[ec];B[ff];W[jg];B[gg]LB[ji:a][ih:b]C[Playing atari here is dangerous. White has four corners and black has only some thickness in the center. The only way for black to win is to keep the center white group weak. Perhaps a double attack against the this group and the right side white group is possible if black attacks in the center instead with moves like 'a' or 'b']

magnus:

I think black played well in the opening. The problems are in the middle game and endgame, and the common error was  that strong or unimportant groups was defended in inefficient ways. Thus many moves that had only strategic value had no strategic value!

if you play a professional they will always say the following no matter how you played: "The only way to become stronger is to understand which groups are strong or weak. The rest is just technique."

Think more about which groups are strong and weak. And in tactical fights think about which stones are important and unimportant. And always have plan how to win - then it is easier to see where your and your opponents true weaknesses on the board are.]
