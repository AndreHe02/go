C[Hi
I was black in this game and won by 2.5 points.
I thought i would lose because my opponent attacked me most of the game, but finally not.
Please solve my question in this game and give me some comment.
Thank you.

Velirun:  I will do my best to help you learn from this game.  However, I must add the obligatory disclaimer that I'm only a lowly 8 kyu myself, so my opinions are not necessarily the best.

Velirun:  Also, I will comment on your opponents moves as well as your own.  Learn from his mistakes and successes as well;  you will learn much faster!]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[qo];W[ci];B[do]C[D5 or F5, which move will be better here?]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dm];W[eo];B[ck];W[qc]C[Velirun:  This invasion is much, much to early.  While white will get a small amount of corner territory, you will have a nice, thick position on the outside that will affect the entire board.]
;B[qd]C[Velirun:  I believe this is the correct direction to block.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb]
(;B[rc]C[Velirun:  N17 is the correct move here.  S17 allows white to escape his confinement in the corner.  See the variation for the expected result.]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[mc]C[Velirun:  Good play for white.  He is no longer confined as in the variation!]
;B[md];W[ld];B[mb];W[lc];B[me];W[le];B[hd]C[Velirun:  I would instead suggest N14.  In general, it is helpful to avoid being "hit on the head of two stones", which would occur if white did N14.  This is generally speaking, of course.  Additionally, it helps more to solidfy some territory on that side.]
;W[gc];B[cc]C[Velirun:  This is good timing.  If you wish to do a 3-3 invasion, do it once the opponent has a "double wing" formation around their 4-4 stone.]

(;W[dc]C[Velirun:  I would not suggest blocking this way for white.  He will likely profit more if he goes C16 instead.  See variation.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf]
(;B[bd]C[Velirun:  This is too submissive; see the variation a more ideal sequence.]
;W[df];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[od];B[nd];W[oe];B[pe]C[Velirun:  This is a mistake, as you see in the game.  You will lose those five stones!  Simply extending to N14 will avoid this.  A few moves back, I suggested you extend here before - there would be no trouble now if you had]
;W[mf];B[of];W[ne];B[ec]C[Velirun:  This is an interesting idea, but I think white is a bit too thick in this area for it to work out very well.  I would suggesting building up elsewhere first.]
;W[ed];B[fc];W[fb];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[ge];B[ff];W[dg];B[gf]
;W[he];B[fh];W[ab];B[ac];W[bb];B[ba];W[da];B[ae]C[Velirun:  Perfect life.  Very good.]
;W[af];B[jq]C[Velirun:  This is a very big point, perhaps the biggest on the board.  Extending from a shimari (corner enclosure in the bottom right) is always very big.]
;W[mq]C[Velirun:  White chooses to invade.  You should think about chasing this stone for a while - you can profit from the chase.  See variation for an example of what might happen.]

(;B[gq]C[Velirun:  Don't need to worry about that stone's safety yet - white stone at N3 is weaker.]
;W[en];B[em]C[Velirun:  I think this move is... somewhat useless.  What are you trying to protect?]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[qm];B[pk];W[qk];B[pm];W[pj];B[ok];W[qn];B[pn]
;W[ro];B[qp];W[rp];B[rq];W[qr];B[pr];W[rr];B[qq];W[sq]C[After here, the 2 white stone is alive.
Was there any way to eat them?

Velirun:  White set up a basis on your side with those two stones.  He would have to be sleeping in order to have it killed!  However, notice that while he lived, he gave you thickness.  Remember that lone white stone at N3?  You can probably kill it, and gain a large amount of territory from it.

Velirun:  Remember that in this game, you may lose out locally, but you will almost always gain elsewhere!]

(;B[mo]C[Velirun:  Tight attack on the lone stone.  A looser attack will gain you more territory, if you can control it.  See variation.]
;W[kp]C[Velirun:  Good move on white's part.  The gap between K3 and N5 is too wide.]
;B[kq]C[Velirun:  What are you attacking?  You cannot cut these two stones apart.]
;W[lp];B[jo];W[ko];B[mp];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[lq]C[Velirun:  You catch the one stone, white escapes the others.  He should be satisfied.]
;W[fj]C[Velirun:  White chooses a good point to attack your weak group.]
;B[hh]C[Velirun:  Good shape move.];W[fm];B[dj];W[ei];B[gj]
;W[fk];B[fi];W[ek]TR[fj][ek][fk]C[Velirun:  Bad move for white.  The marked stones form an empty triangle - this shape should be avoided like the plague!]
;B[dl]C[Velirun:  I do not think this move is necessary.];W[bl]
C[Velirun:  White steals your base out from under you.  Danger!]
;B[bo];W[bm];B[bn];W[bk];B[di];W[dh]C[Velirun:  From this point, there is not really much hope for your group on the left side.  =(]

;W[hj];B[ih]C[Velirun:  If you do G7 here, you can continue to attack that large group.]

C[I tried to save the big group stones in the left side but I had no confidence at all.
Luckily, my opponent did not pay attention here.
If he played b4, would I still survive ?

Velirun:  You should not be able to survive in the corner, unfortunately.  B4 would seal your fate.]
;W[ke];B[je]C[Velirun:  I would suggest saving your group in the lower left instead of responding here.  If that group lives, his entire corner is in danger, if not dead.  This is worth more than even that entire group at the top!]
;W[fq]C[Velirun:  I imagine white is trying to make sure he lives here.  I would simply go B4 and kill the group.]
;B[cq]C[Velirun:  Excellent move.  Both attacking and defending.]

;W[lo]C[Velirun:  Even worse.  What is he afraid of?];B[mn]
C[Velirun:  Oh my!  What did you think was the danger?  Be very careful in games like this - wouldn't you kick yourself if you lost by .5 point?]
;W[jh];B[jd];W[kc];B[cl];W[aj];B[sc];W[qa];B[ea];W[ga];B[da]
;W[fa];B[tt];W[sa];B[re]C[I played here because feeling dangerous here.
Is it necessary?

Velirun:  Absolutely not.  There is no trouble he can cause here.]
;W[sp];B[ps];W[ss];B[gl];C[Velirun:  Not a bad game overall.  A little too timid in the endgame - this will get better in time.  If you wish to ask any questions about this review, please contact me by email, I would be glad to answer.]
)
(;B[kn]C[Velirun:  I believe this is safe, and a number of points bigger.]

(;B[jo];W[mo];B[on];W[ln];B[jm];W[ll];B[ol]C[Velirun:  Thanks to chasing that one stone, you've gained more solid territory at the top.  Of course, the real game will not go like exactly like this, but you get the general idea.]
))
(;B[cf];W[de];B[bg];W[df];B[af];W[cg];B[bf];W[ch]C[Velirun:  This is the end of the joseki.  When your opponent does a "double hane", always thinking about cutting and atari!]

(;W[fe]C[Velirun:  End of the joseki is normally E15, but since there is a stone at H16, both the ladder and net do not work.  F15 will still catch the stone, and aids in attacking the stone at H16.]
