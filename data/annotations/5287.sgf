C[Game commented by Niall "NM"];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dq];B[ic]
;W[nc];B[pf]C[nefaste: I think this should be at P17, to prevent white from making a base easily...

NM: Also possible, but I prefer this.
With the stone on the other side at J17
W can still make a reasonable base, and
this play reaches out further on the R.];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]C[NM: Too soon in my view. I would play
L17. B could reply to this with Q9...];B[rb]C[NM: ... but he doesn't, so R18 was sente.]
;W[kc];B[ie];W[ke];B[do]C[NM: Big, but I would have played on the 
R first to settle the Q16 group, now that
the W group beside it is settled.];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dm];W[fq]
;B[di];W[df];B[ed]C[NM: The W move feels too me a bit deep at this stage of the game, though it is
tempting - and being on the 4th line it
should be able to escape. But I think 
I would have played eC8, D9, or B16.

The reply of E16 is good and calm.];W[ch];B[ci];W[ce];B[de]
C[NM: Unless B is going to continue with
E14, this move is best avoided.];W[cf];B[bd];W[bi];B[bj];W[bh]
;B[ck];W[ee];B[dd];W[ef];B[ge]C[NM: A satisying move, but not necessary
- and gote. B should have played
something like R10.];W[qh];B[ld]C[nefaste: I'm not sure what to think of this move... It lead to a wall facing the center at the expense of a bit of territory on the top...

NM: It can lead to various results, but
I think it's premature. It doesn't
really help you to settle your Q16 group.
I would not play it.];W[lc];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[qj]C[NM: As W here, I would have played R13.
But since W doesn't, B must.];B[kd];W[jd];B[md];W[jc];B[mc]
;W[mb];B[ne];W[id];B[hd];W[hc];B[gc];W[hb];B[gb];W[ib];B[fh]
C[NM: This is the biggest point on the
board? I would play something like O3.];W[gf];B[hf];W[gg];B[hi]
;W[hg];B[ig];W[fe];B[fd]C[nefaste: I hesitated playing at F13 instead. I explored a few variations after the game, and the white group seems killable. But the fight can get messy... I don't like to gamble a game on a single fight, unless I'm far behind !

NM: I can understand that. I think I
would have played it anyway, but it 
can indeed get messy.];W[fg];B[eh];W[eg];B[fo]C[NM: NOW that is indeed big!]
;W[je];B[ih]C[NM: ... but that is not.];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip];B[mq]
C[nefaste: I'm not sure of the choice of the invasion point. White's answer at L3 gives him solid territory on the bottom left. But If I had played at L3 instead his right side territory would have grown large...

NM: This looks OK to me, but I would have
gone for the classic O3.];W[kq];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[rr];B[oq]
C[NM: You can't live locally, but you can
make more of a threat with Q3.];W[qm];B[op];W[po];B[lr];W[kr]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[qg]C[NM: Big, but as B I would be itching to
play O2.];W[rh];B[rg];W[io];B[hn];W[jm];B[oi]C[NM: If you don't play O2 you must move into the open area from below to ensure
that the N3 group has 2 eyes - e.g. N5.];W[oj];B[nj];W[ok];B[lg]
;W[kg];B[kh];W[jg];B[jh];W[lf];B[mf];W[nk];B[nn];W[lo];B[mo]

;W[si];B[sg];W[rj];B[rs];W[rq];B[om];W[pl];B[ks];W[js];B[ls]
;W[ir];B[oc]C[nefaste: I think this was a mistake. I didn't foresee this sequence would end in gote for me. I was planing to play P5 next, but white got the chance to play it... which lead to a ko for the life of black's bottom group.]
;W[ob];B[nd];W[nb];B[pc]C[NM: Not strictly necessary: something
like M4 is more urgent.];W[ra];B[sb];W[oo];B[no];W[nr];B[nq]
C[nefaste: After reviewing, I think black can live unconditionaly by playing M4 instead of O3.

NM: Not if W answers M3 he can't. This
attack shows what I was saying before,
how necessary to make sure of the life
of this group.];W[mp];B[ns];W[os];B[mr];W[ms];B[lp];W[lq];B[ns]

C[nefaste: I think white should have played L8 or some other point. He didn't see the capture didn't work.
