;B[pd]C[Hi Imagist. I think we know each other from KGS.

Of course I cannot judge whether this game is representative of your overall way of playing. Since you've sent this one for review, I'll treat it as such. My impression is that your play lacks patience.You invade enemy moyos while your own groups in the proximity are not strong enough, while the invasion is not even necessary.]
;W[dp]C[Counting is a very useful tool and deceivingly easy, to judge whether invasions are absolutely necessary. If behind, one needs to complicate and an invasion may be a good way to do that. If not behind, an invasion can turn out sour.]

;B[rq];W[qr];B[ro];W[oq];B[rm];W[on];B[pm]LB[oo:a][rr:b]C[This is a well known joseki. Normally White takes the initiative to build or to play elsewhere, leaving the potential of A and B. Black will postpone playing either of them until it becomes clear which is the best.]

TR[no][oo]C[Imagist: Here I thought I was doing okay.  A is clearly worth more than B, but the triangled stones, though weak, occupied the key point, flattening white's moyo while expanding black's.

Dieter: 

First thing that strikes me is that 39 is too close to Black's thick wall. I would chose a play around A (C in winmgt), enabling a true moyo at B (D in winmgt) next.

Secondly, Black's top right is indeed a moyo, while White's bottom right looks much like fourth line territory to me. If we speak of flattening, we mostly talk about third line territory. 

Since it is White's turn to play, I'd say he's ahead.];W[jd]
LB[nc:b][cm:a]C[Since White has half a base at 16 I would either play more actively at B, or continue building at A.]
;B[mo];W[lp];B[cn]LB[dj:A]C[Imagist: I think this was too much, A might have been better.

Dieter: No I think this is spot on. A would be too close to your own strong stones, attacking a useless white stone.]
;W[cl]
(;B[dl]LB[fp:A]C[Imagist: My goal with this move was to build up thickness for a reduction at A.

Dieter: I understand your point, but my feeling is that there are better possibilities for 45. However, I do not feel strong enough to judge the variations. Personally I feel safest with the corner invasion. The double approach looks interesting, but the last variation gives a fight which may not be favourable for Black. I leave it to you to judge which variation you like most.]
;W[ck]LB[dk:A][dm:B][fp:C]C[Imagist: I expected this move to be at A, but this move left me with a difficult choice; to protect at B or pincer at C.  I chose B.]
;B[dm];W[fp]LB[hp:A]TR[ep][gp][ip][kp][dq][nq][dr][pr][ds][ps]
SQ[ac][af][bf][sm][sq]C[Imagist: Now I felt very behind.  There's still a weakness at A, but it seems too early to attack it.

Dieter: When feeling behind, there is a wonderful instrument: counting. The corner is still open. Black is not strong enough now to invade at A. So let's assume these borders. Then White has 30 points there. Black has strong 6 in upper left and strong 8 in lower right.

Counting komi, Black must only make sure he makes about 25 points in the upper right side while keeping White's weak group on the left under control. Actually, the left is now most urgent. When Black has taken any kind of control over the left (points, thickness), he can work on the upper right.]

(;B[gp]C[This is the wrong order. I show a middle game joseki in the variation, but it is not sure White will be so docile.]

;B[bm];W[bk];B[jl]C[Imagist: Now black has two weak groups.

Dieter: yes];B[bl];W[nc]TR[gf][ag][cg][hh][aj][kp][aq][er][ir]
[es][is][qs]SQ[sm][sq]C[OK. Let's count again. 
White has 20 points on left side. A weak 20 on the lower right and another 10 at lower left. 
Black has 8 points in the lower right and that's it. So the top right moyo must make 50 points while White's top cannot become anything AND the black bottom group must not die. This is a very difficult mission.]

(;B[qf]LB[nd:a]C[Imagist: This was too slow.  A is best I think.

Dieter: Agree];W[ne];B[jc]C[Imagist: I thought my only chance was to invade.]
;W[kc];B[kd]C[Imagist: Any variations I read for trying to live on the side ended without me having enough space, so I decided to crosscut and try for thickness or at least a living group in the center.]

Dieter: I agree, but you put up a good fight in the end.

All in all, I see only one severe mistake (at my level of judgment): the decision to invade at 57 instead of strengthening the left group. Then you missed the middle game joseki but I think it would have ended up sour anyhow.

Extending closely to 39 is another, smaller mistake. Missing the extra push at 11 a joseki mistake, certainly not deadly at our level.

Indeed I cannot see how White could have given you 6 stones.

Have fun with the game.])
