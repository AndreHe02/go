C[greyarea [4k\]: hi
Tomatoboy [3k\]: hi gg
greyarea [4k\]: have a good game


greyarea: I've been playing seriously for about five years, and I've been in the 4-6k range for three of those years (lately having improved from bouncing back and forth between 5k and 6k to bouncing back and forth between 4k and 5k).  In particular, I have yet to beat a 3k in an even or no-komi game, which is a goal in order for me to feel I'm making headway in improving my game.

My ideal playing style would be something akin to Takagawa's "flowing water" or Lee Changho's "stone buddha," but against opponents who make aggressive and unconventional moves, I feel like I don't do a very good job of living up to that.  I think this game is a good example, so I hope to get some tips on where I'm going wrong in my thinking.

Hi,
I am vorpal on KGS and play as 1d so you need to take my comments with the appropriate grain of salt.
I've prefaced my statements with "v:".

Summary:
Overall if I could make only a single point it would be to slow your game down.

It seems to me that you often understood you were leaving a weakness but thought there was no time to cover it. 
I would offer that it makes a lot of sense to keep your positions strong and alive and that in so doing you will 
encounter unlooked for benefits in the fighting to come.

It constantly amazes me how very strong players often make moves that I consider to be very slow. But from their point of view I'm  
sure they would be horrified at my suggested play as being too loose and leaving behind too many defects.

Fell free to get back to me if you have questions about the game comments:
paul.ohmart@gmail.com];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[md]C[greyarea: I've not seen this approach much.  Since it's relatively far away, I decided to ignore it for the time being.]
(;B[jp];W[pc]LB[qf:A]C[greyarea: I don't know if this is a Korean joseki, or what, but this is once again not the type of play I'm accustomed to.

v: I think white would normally play on the other side, somewhere around A.]
(;B[qc]C[v: This has to be a good move.];W[qd]C[greyarea: I'm never quite sure what to do in situations like these.

v: Not to worry. Neither is anyone else. 
I think the idea is to figure out whether you want influence or territory and play accordingly.
Since all your stones are on the bottom I would guess that you want influence to work well with them.]
(;B[rc]C[greyarea: So, you extend from a cross-cut, and I thought it would be better to choose the weaker stone to extend.

v: This move seems to me to be placing emphasis on the corner instead of the outside.]
;W[qe]C[v: This might be what I would do. The idea is to build outside influence.]
(;B[oc];W[pe];B[od]C[v: Your play here is consistent with the extension at S17.]
;W[qi]C[v: It seems to me that you have shifted the opening from a moyo strategy to a territory one by taking the corner in exchange for giving white a position on the side.]
(;B[ok];W[pb]C[v: What a curious move. I wonder what white is thinking the follow up will be.]
(;B[oe]LB[ob:A]TR[md]C[greyarea: I guess I should have just played at A.  Still annoyed at the triangle stone, I wanted to prevent white from connecting to it.

v: I agree about A. It is now difficult to attack the white group on the right.
Also, note that after black at A white could not have connected so easily.]
;W[nb]C[greyarea: But of course I wasn't anticipating this move, so white connects anyway, and I'm in a bad position.]
;B[ob];W[oa]
(;B[pf];W[qf];B[of];W[pg];B[og];W[ph]C[v: This exchange is all forced but I think it favors white since the black group is not connected in the center. I would have preferred the earlier variations so as not to have built white up.]
;B[pa];W[qa];B[qb];W[pa]
(;B[na]C[greyarea: Probably a bad choice.];W[ma];B[ra];W[na]
LB[sb:A]C[greyarea: Perhaps I should have just lived at A here, but that's a small life.  I'm annoyed at white for getting away with this, and I want to do something to punish the bad shape white has here.

v: I think A is necessary. Having a living group in the corner gives you pressure on white on both sides.]
;B[fc]LB[kc:B][lc:A]C[greyarea: Not sure this was the best choice for doing that, though.  Maybe at A or B?

v: It is hard to mount an attack from a weak position. Your corner is hanging and your 8 stone group in the center is not connected. This is a sort of recipie for disaster. It is better to slow down a little and strengthing your groups for the fighting ahead.]
;W[hc]C[greyarea: Now I realize the last move was a mistake (I guess I'm letting white's unconventional moves disturb my thinking).  I don't want to jump into the corner here, though, because it seems that giving white lots of thickness would only compound the error.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[db];W[cc]
(;B[jc]C[v: The game is sort of thrown up in the air here and the fighting possibilities become too complex for amateur players. Overall thought I would favor whict as he has fewer defects. Let's see how it developes.]
(;W[gd]C[v: Seems a little off point.]
(;B[ke]C[v: I like the idea behind this move. The idea here is that you need to figure out how to cover your weaknesses in the corner and for your top right group. 

Looking ahead a little I see that we are entering a series of exchanges that are dubious.

The difficulty with this move is that you are prompting white to play at N14 which weakens your stones.]
;W[mf];B[mg]C[v: And now you are pushing him toward your two center stones.]
;W[lf];B[kf];W[lg]C[v: And here you force him to weaken your N13 stone.]
;B[mh]C[v: So my conclusion is that it would have been better just to close the corner and decide how to play on the outside later.]
(;W[fd]
(;B[gb]C[greyarea:  I guess I should have just left these for dead.

v: Yes. This area is not so important.];W[hb];B[cb];W[bb];B[dc]
;W[cd];B[ha];W[ia];B[ga];W[jb]C[greyarea: This then is galling, since I wanted to keep those two groups separated.]
(;B[fq]LB[jh:A]C[greyarea: Since the upper side is a wash, I decided to play elsehwhere, though maybe A first would have been better.

v: Black has two groups that white can kill. Once he does it is impossible to bring much pressure on his position.]
(;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[dn]C[greyarea: I feel white made a mistake trying this joseki here, since black is already well established on the right side.]
;W[ep]C[greyarea:  Momentarily happy I've managed to force white into bad shape, I then proceed to blow it.

v: I would prefer white here. You have a cut at G3 and a weak stone at D6. Overall I would say black is developing too fast.]
(;B[co];W[dl];B[em];W[dj]C[v: These moves strengthen white toward the top.]
;B[bq];W[gq];B[hq];W[gr];B[hr];W[er]C[v: This is a good time to pull back an look at the game overall.

What I do is look for the various weaknesses in the two positions and then try and figure out how to proceed based on them.

The upper left black group is hanging. I think it is worth about 30 points. Since it doesn't have any effect on the other parts of the board I would consider it as a 30-point gote yose move.

The upper right corner is hanging. I would estimate this as being worth about 15-points. This group however does affect other parts fo the board. If black plays to make it live then he can make forcing moves on the white right side group which will aid in closing the lower right quadrant. 

The top center black stones are in a lot of trouble. They don't look like they can make life so they probably need to connect but doing so may endanger black's lower right quadrant. They will probably die.

The black 10-stone group on the upper right is still not completly connected and safe. White can make forcing moves to make it connect on dame.

For black's part the white group in the lower left is not alive. 

Having looked at the positional defects I would then ask if black could take the entier lower right quadrant without playing inside it.I think that is a little ambitious and would not like to hinge the game on it.

Overall I would prefer to have white's position.

So... how to proceed?]
(;B[dh]LB[po:A]C[greyarea: Perhaps I should have locked up the lower right at A here and saved this for later.  I'm still annoyed at white and trying find a punishment for what I see as white's mistakes.

v: I can see the emotive thrust behind your moves but I would think that a more patient approach would have offered better results for you. 

A is indeed very large.

This move seems to be right in the midst of white's strength and with all the black weaknesses I would expect the outcome to favor white.]
(;W[eh]C[v: It is a sort of axiom that you want to avoid playing touching moves an an area where you are very strong. Since white is very strong around here this attachment just gives you chances. Still, I think this area is not the piviot of the game and I would leave it to return later on.]
(;B[eg];W[dg];B[ei];W[ch];B[di];W[ci];B[fh]C[v: The way this has worked out favors you. The L-line stones are now stronger, the white bottom group is now weaker and these stones have influence in the center.]
;W[hg]
(;B[jh];W[hi];B[fk]
(;W[kh];B[ig];W[hf]
(;B[kg];W[lh];B[ji];W[kj]C[v: The problem here is that you are pushing white into your large potential area on the bottom and endangering the 11 stone black group on the upper right.]
;B[ij];W[gi];B[ed];W[ee];B[ec];W[ea]C[v: This really hurts.]
;B[ef];W[de];B[ej]

;B[km];W[jm];B[kn];W[hm];B[il];W[im];B[jl];W[kk]LB[sb:A]C[greyarea: I then proceed to lose all my stones in the upper center, though I think it likely that I could have saved them, and if I could have done it in sente, allowing me to play at A, I would have had a good shot at winning the game.  Though I'm less interested in what I could have done to save the middle stones than in how I could have avoided getting into this mess in the first place.  But of course any advice on how to think in complicated life-and-death situations like this (beyond just "read better") would be appreciated.
