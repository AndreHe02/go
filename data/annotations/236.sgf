DT[1995-10-27]TM[60]KM[5.5];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj];W[dj];B[jj]C[Jared:  Black 7 is a move  I would not play.  It is an extremely high level move that is difficult to  exploit to its full potential.  For example, in this game, it will play  almost no role.  It doesn't really form a moyo on either side yet.  If white  ere to play on one side and get sente, then white could play on both sides.   Remember corner-sides-center.]

(;W[jd]C[Jared:  White 8 is probably  too easy on black.  Now  black will play 9 and get ahead in the race to build a larger moyo.   Since white will thus have to invade white's moyo first, white should  start now.  How about o17?  Black will have to be careful to retain sente  to play on the bottom first.]
;B[jp]C[Jared: Black 9 good.  completes moyo.  But note that the order of 7 and 9 should be  reversed.]
;W[nc]
(;B[ne]C[Jared:  Black 11 is a fine move, but  only if you know  what to do with it.  It is loose and black runs the risk of a big  disaster.  It's aim is to build a moyo on a large scale.  I almost always  recommend the one space jump for weaker players (i.e. Q14).  I think  O15 is a good move however, particularly in conjunction with the center  star point.  Black wants to play a *BIG* moyo  game.]
;W[md]C[Jared: White N16 should be at M16, to provide  better shape and balance with K16.    After black closes the corner  (maybe Q 17 now or a little later), N16 will also be too close to  black's thickness.]
;B[cc]C[Is this premature?
Jared:  Yes.  Black currently has the bigger moyo.  The person with the  bigger moyo stands to benefit by continuing to enlarge it.  This would be  consistent with black's earlier strategy of K10 and O15.  Moves that come  to mind are F3 and M14.  Q17 remains undenaibly  large.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg]C[C13 is joseki.  Can W be punished for  this in any way?
  Jared:  Sure.  Cut at C13 or maybe D15.  But usually punishment will come  100 or more moves later.  Let these weaknesses lie like a thorn in  White's side, affecting his entire game.  If W goes back and connects,  that's loss of sente, and effectively a free move for black, much like  one extra handicap stone.]

(;B[db];W[eb];B[cg]C[Jared:  Black 23 should be  the connection at C18, ensuring life and gaining sente as white is almost  forced to protect at F17.]

(;W[dg]C[Jared: But as noted before, white  should just extend to  B12.  With the possibility of capturing D18, White would not go  wrong.]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[ci]C[Jared: White is  running along the second line.  Black should be celebrating.]
;W[bi];B[cj];W[bj];B[ck];W[cb];B[bb];W[da]C[Jared: It looks like B9 will win the  capturing race.   See variation.]

(;B[ba]
(;W[bd]C[Jared: White B36 is a  terrible waste.  See previous  variation]
;B[bc];W[bk];B[cl];W[bl];B[cm];W[bn];B[bm];W[am];B[cn];W[co]C[Perhaps this is punishing W, but not what I had in mind  at all.
  Jared: This is a disaster for white.  White's moyo is gone, and white  only has territory on the upper side.  Black's C10 wall, although mildly  short of liberties, is very  strong.]
;B[bo];W[an];B[al];W[ak]C[Jared:  Hmm.  White B10 group has  effectively six liberties (becasue of need to  capture B16.  Black B5 will have to gain that before trying to capture.  This  seems tough, so maybe just let B10 group live.  It's not that big.  C3 might  be particularly vicious now.  If you don't like that (because you worry  about your C 10 group) jump to E11, or play D5-C4-E5.  I don't like this  last becasue it destroys corner aji, but it would seem to be suffieicnt to  win the game easiuly.]

(;B[ao];W[al];B[cp];W[do];B[bq]
(;W[cq]C[Jared: Cringe...  Better to  sacrifice a bad position  than to cling to it.  Black can win by taking sente.  Maybe  Q17.]
;B[ap];W[bp];B[de];W[df];B[cp]
(;W[ad]C[Jared: White 62 is bad.  The local ko threat at C2  is  better.   A 16 throws away a point as a prisoner.  C2 builds power and  prevents black from playing there.  This is a multiple step ko for black, as B10 group has 6 liberties.   Black is not gonna win  this.]
;B[ac];W[bp];B[el]C[Jared: This is a  tough position for white.  White probably doesn't have time to play A3.   Remember, this is a multiple step ko for black.  E15 now might be  disasterous for white.]
;W[aq];B[qp]C[Jared: Aiee!   Combine attack and defense.  Expand the moyo, let white invade.  You  *WANT*  white to invade at R3.  As mentioned, E15 looks HUGE.  Also M124,  Q17 big.]
;W[pf]C[Jared: After the rather long left side  "joseki," we return to the right side, which should have been dealt with  before the C17 invasion.  Note that black should be extremely pleased  with the final result, despite a few mistakes along the way.  All white  got was at best 20 points of territory on the left, while giving black 6  points AND a big center wall worth at least 20 points of influence.  This  in the middle of white's san-ren-sei...
However, now black gave away sente at R4, so maybe white can return the  favor...]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[oc]C[Jared: R17 is a  key point here.  White's Q14 group is under attack, and must escape, but  later black may have to defend R17.  I'd have been tempted to play R15 at  R17 or maybe Q17.  But R15 announces an attack on white by making white  Q14 group heavy, so P16 leaving no cutting points, is maybe the way to  play.  It's not beautiful, but in life and death beauty is not important.]
;W[od]C[Jared: White P16???  Why?  Q12 is important.  The two  white stones need to  esacpe.]
;B[oe];W[nd];B[pe]C[Jared: Now white  can no longer play R17 and must be content with  Q17.]
;W[oi];B[oj]C[Jared: Black's gonna get territory.  Good.  Another idea might be Q11 instead of  P10.]
;W[pi];B[qj];W[mg]C[Jared: More gote  moves.  Black is  alive in the corner.  See variations.  Better to  continue the attack on the white group with N15.]

(;B[qc];W[ob];B[gq]C[Jared: Where did this  come from?  The G3 soldier is AWOL.  There is a battle going on in the  upper right hand corner.  Finish one battle before moving on.  It is  sometimes difficult to tell when this is, but Q17 is necessary now to  limit the liberties of O16 group and to secure life for Q15 so that it  can attack.  You see now that R17 was almost a completely redundant  move.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[rd];W[ra];B[sb];W[nm]C[Jared: White 90 is vague.  The P11  group is still weak so white 90 makes two weak groups.  E15 remains huge.   Now that R17 is alive (waste of ko threats by white earlier!)  Black can  play M14.]
;B[ni];W[rf];B[re];W[ng];B[oh];W[ph];B[og];W[of];B[nh];W[nf];B[pg];W[np]
C[Jared: It looks like M14 captures  all of  white's stones.  If not, black will gain unbelievable thickness.  N15 is  vital for white.]
;B[lp]C[Jared:  Both players should keep in  mind the sequence with R12... (not to be played yet, of course...)
It's hard for me to know what to say here.  White is in serious trouble.   Living will be difficult  The threat of E15 looms even if white lives. I  might be tempted to play M4 at M3 to guoge out eye space, but it isn't  clear that this is better.]

(;W[oq]
(;B[mq]C[Jared: M3 must  be at O3 without thinking.  The corner  is big and white might get an eye there.  Shape is not important in life  and death.]

(;W[pq]C[Jared: Q3 must be at R2.  Q3 strengthens black,  loses  liberties, and eye-making  potential.]
;B[qq];W[on];B[op];W[nq]C[Jared: The forcing move at P4 implies a cut at O5 now.  Otherwise leave it  unplayed as it wastes a ko threat and hurts the stone at N3.
Given that, R7 is probably better than Q7.]

;B[jl];W[kk];B[jk];W[nk];B[qh]C[Jared: How about exploiting black's R6 weakness now?]

(;W[me];B[kj];W[ee]C[Jared: Now we see how big  E15  is.  Black will now get very little center territory and white gets  the upper side.  Black would probably resign here if it were not a  tournament game.]
;B[hf];W[ih];B[jf];W[ig]
(;B[kh]C[Jared: Just connect at J14.  The white stones at K12  would then be a in as much trouble as black J15, if not more.  Later, a  jump to H16 by black could be very bad for  white.]
;W[if];B[lf];W[mf]C[Jared: R6 is  probably the biggest move on the board for both sides in what  follows...]
