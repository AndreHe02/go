;B[pc];W[dq];B[dd];W[pq];B[qe]C[A bit slow for my tastes, but it works.  Alternatives include R14, or attacking one of white's corners.]
;W[co];B[cf]C[Weaker with the 4-4.  4-4 is meant to be a influential move, not territorial.  Your corner is still open for attack on the top.]
;W[jc];B[qo];W[mp]C[Odd, high play that could leave weakness to attack around L3 later...]
;B[qj]C[A bit long of a stretch, still could be pincered at R7.]
;W[gc];B[ck];W[hq];B[je]C[If you're trying to remove white's influence, I'd suggest more along the lines of G15, Since it would then have the support of your corner.  This stone is kinda floating, but at this point that is ok.]
;W[lc];B[jj]C[I remember you mentioning this stone in your explanation, so I'll probably come back to this, but at this point in the game it's a very good move imo.]
;W[ec];B[ge]C[Good move to eliminate all of whites influence from that group.]

(;B[bk]C[I would've played C8.  See variation.];W[cl];B[dl]
;W[dm]C[This way gives white more territory.];B[el];W[jm];B[em]
;W[dn];B[en];W[eo];B[fo];W[ep];B[fp];W[fq];B[al]C[Leave this for the endgame.  A move like J5 would be pretty severe.]
;W[bm];B[jq]C[A stone needs one of two things to survive: an escape route (support) or room for a base (about N3 in this case).  This  has neither.  This move would've been stronger before the fight moved this far.]

;B[mo];W[no];B[mn];W[qp];B[on]C[Q5 is the typical response, but in this case this works well too.]
;W[po];B[qn];W[ro];B[rn];W[rp];B[nn]C[Ok in this case, but it's pretty slow and uncessary.  It prevents bad aji, but there aren't any bigger moves really.  At this point, the game should be in the bag.  You have the entire middle and most of the right and half of the left.  Score est. on CGoban says B+105.]
;W[oo];B[hp];W[le];B[kg]C[M14 would've worked better.  Touch to defend, attack from a distance.]

(;B[in];W[kn];B[lo];W[jo]C[Score est. says W+0.5 at this point.  Unfortunately, there aren't any other points to be gained and only points for you to lose so the game is pretty much over at this point.  I could be wrong though, so it's always good to keep playing if in doubt.  If it's obvious, though, resigning is the polite thing to do.  A general rule of thumb to prevent resigning out of frustrating, but still resigning when things are hopeless, is to wait 10 turns after thinking about resigning.  If you still don't see how you can win, then resign.]

(;B[jo]C[This probably would've solved your problem.  The problem with setups like this is lack of connections, and white kept forcing you to connect and die.  Good play by white though.  Study this sequence and remember what your problems were and look for them in future games.]
