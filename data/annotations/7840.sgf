C[Hi, thank you for reviewing my game.

In this game I was playing black, while white had ½ komi.

My opponent requested it before the game started.


TM—Hello, I'm the reviewer (Guichocha on KGS). Here are some main points to consider:

1) Don't be afraid to give up stones. There were a few critical situations in the game (see 49, 83, 149) where you tried to hold on to everything and only ended up losing points. You can often use a sacrifice to gain strength, for example by building a wall.

2) When you have powerful groups, you don't need to fight so violently. Instead of getting tangled up in your opponent's stones, back off a little and try to see the bigger picture. (See the moves mentioned above, as well as 73, 105, 118.)

3) Protect your weak groups! Throughout the game you actually did a good job of keeping your groups stable, so the comment applies specifically to the bottom right. It would have taken just one move in gote at the beginning of the game to avoid a lot of trouble later ...

It was a pleasure to write the review; I hope it helps!

(;B[cg]C[Fernando Aguilar once recommended this move for black in this position, so naturally I wanted to try it out instead of playing the usual joseki move at C11.

TM—I dare not disagree with Fernando Aguilar! Indeed, upon looking into this position, it seems that C13 is the right move (see variation for comparison). The expectation here is that white will invade at some point, say around D10, and you can attack him on a large scale. This is exactly what happened at move 116. Thanks for teaching me this. :)]
;W[qf];B[pj]LB[nd:A]C[I have been trying to experiment this pincer for a long time, and made no expection in this game.

TM—Sure, this looks interesting. Another option, since you're developing a large-scale moyo, would be to play a high move in the direction of your other stones, i.e., at A.]

(;B[qn]LB[lc:4][mc:2][md:3][nd:1][op:A]C[TM—Since Q10 is so far away from your top group, you should keep pushing (1-2-3-4). This would also work harmoniously with your stones on the left side, which are building a large centre framework. You could then plan on making an extension at the bottom. The extension you made, though, is going too far: you are only prompting white to strengthen his corner by jumping out to A, which will in turn leave your stone at R6 vulnerable. Play R7 instead.]
;W[op];B[pf]LB[on:A]C[I thought this result would look nice for black, and decided to defend in gote.

Is this ok?

TM—You are right to want to defend, but this looks overconcentrated. Since the bottom is sparse and white's corner is strong, I would defend there instead, for example at A.]
;W[pg]C[I was surprised by his fighting spirit.

TM—This is violent!];B[og];W[of];B[oh]C[This was a misclick (my dog jumped on my lap and I accidentally clicked without thinking)]

How should I answered this move?

The result I got doesn't seem good for black.

TM—This is the natural point of invasion; you can see that R6 wishes it were at R7. I think your answer at A is good, provided you are willing to give up some territory along the side. Considering the influence you are building toward the centre, it is only fair to let white take some points too!]

C[I was thinking of grabbing some corner territory here...

;W[md];B[ob]LB[ld:A]C[TM—This is an endgame move. Think of the bigger picture, i.e., the moyo that you've been building. What about blocking at A, for example?]
;W[oc];B[nb];W[gc]LB[mb:1][pb:3][mc:2]C[TM—Although you've been playing endgame moves, white shouldn't necessarily ignore them. The top right group is in danger! To protect, white can instead play 1-2-3, for example.]
(;B[ke]SQ[nb][lc]C[Where should I have played instead of this, to protect the cuts and later attack the top right group?

TM—The problem here is two weak connections (knight's jumps) near the edge. White will easily cut through. Since your group on the right side is so strong, you can press white against it (see variation).]

;B[bc]C[B15 surprised me.

TM—Me too.];W[cb];B[ba];W[cf];B[df];W[ce]C[I was really happy when white played this move.]
;B[bg]C[It looks like I should be able to capture the four white stones now.

TM—Nice move!];W[de]C[TM—This of course just strengthens black.]
;B[ee];W[dj];B[fj]LB[gn:A][gp:B]SQ[dd][cg][dm][cn][do]C[Should I have played elsewhere instead?

Now that I look at it, it looks like overplay, considering my 3 stones below don't have a base.

TM—This isn't unreasonable at all; in fact, I'd say it's an excellent move. Let's look at the board position.

First, look at the original joseki with the marked stones. The reason you played at C13 instead of C10 was because of the strength coming from the corner stone at D16. You made a choice not be submissive, and now you must be prepared to fight the inevitable invasion.

Now, the top stones are still strong since you killed the corner. White has a small amount of aji from the possible cut at D13, but that's nothing you can't handle. You also have a lot of strength emanating from the right side, so it makes sense to play F10 in that it is a severe cap extending all the way across the board.

Finally, you don't really have room to play along the left side. You would become overconcentrated, and it would be too easy for white to escape into the centre.

During this fight, your three stones below will probably want to jump out to A or somewhere nearby; you can then think of pressing down on B. An important point to consider, though, is that your bottom right group still isn't settled, so white might be able to mount a splitting attack against that group and your three stones. I know there's been a lot of fighting going on and it might seem there hasn't been a good opportunity for settling the bottom in gote, but your group there would really thank you for it!

(A good opportunity, by the way, might be move 99.  E17 was big, but the bottom is urgent.)]
;W[el];B[dk]LB[gn:A]C[TM—Attaching like this is typically a defensive tactic. Here you're just giving white something to hold on to and fight against. This would have been a good time to jump out to A.]
;W[ek]
(;B[ej]LB[ck:A]C[TM—Good fighting spirit, but this endangers your stones. Consider that white is deep in your territory and should have to struggle to live. Draw back calmly to A and let him fight.]
;W[dl];B[ck];W[cl]SQ[dm][cn][do]C[TM—Take a moment here to think about your three stones. What should black do next?]
(;B[bk]C[TM—Oh no! How should white punish?]
(;W[bl];B[bn]LB[id:E][di:D][gk:B][gl:C][jq:A]C[I tried to capture the 5 white stones, even when there was no way to do it.

Where should I have played instead?

TM—The defensive move at A, of course, is urgent. Apart from that, you could play a move like B, on the border of two moyos. Note that C might be possible but is more complex and much more risky since white will cut at B. You could sacrifice your stones in sente with D. Another idea to keep in mind would be to press at E. White will surely not ignore such a move, and it gets you some solid point in the centre.]
(;W[cj]C[TM—White failed to capture these stones in the end. Was there any way he could have got some points here?]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[ci];W[di];B[dh]C[Of course, I had spotted this nice tesuji for capturing.

Otherwise I couldn't have played B6.

TM—Good! A classic squeeze.];W[ei];B[eh];W[fk]LB[gk:A][fn:B]
C[TM—A very bad move; I don't understand the point of playing here. This is slow, bad shape (it makes an empty triangle), and removes aji by forcing you to capture. White should at least jump out to A, or just play a secure move by closing off at B.]
;B[fi];W[fn]LB[jq:A]C[Where should I play now?

Protecting the O4 group seems logical, I wonder why I didn't do so before.

TM—I wonder too! Protect the bottom group! You suffered a heavy loss on the left side, but the game could go either way at this point. Jumping to A is solid and makes a large dent in white's territory. You might be surprised at how big this move is.]
;B[hp];W[kq]C[TM—White happily slices you into two groups that can't possibly both be saved.]
;B[kr];W[jr];B[jq];W[ir]LB[ks:A]C[TM—White should hane at A first. This is a chance for you to make an eye at the bottom.]
;B[iq];W[ks]
(;B[lr]C[TM—You must fight the ko here. There is a lot at stake.]
;W[hr]SQ[iq][jq]C[I tried to get too much here.

TM—Indeed! Let's say that the stones on the left are a lost cause. The stones on the right have no eyes, and will have to fight in the centre if they're going to live. How? Think about this carefully before looking at the variations. (Hint: sacrifice the marked stones.)]
