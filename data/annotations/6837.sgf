C[FM: Hello Laurent, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with FM: as my nick is Field Mouse]
;B[qd];W[pq];B[dp];W[dd];B[fc];W[df]LB[ch:A]C[FM: after this kind of move, white must watch his steps carefully to be the first to protect the open skirt at A.]
;B[kc];W[qo];B[kq];W[cn];B[fp]
(;W[bp]C[FM: this kind of things feel like an aji keshi, as black is forced to protect his weakness on the bottom]
;B[cq];W[ck]TR[bp][cq]C[FM: in this case, I think that the marked exchange was good for black]
;B[pj];W[mq]C[FM: natural];B[ko]LB[od:A][pl:B]
(;W[od];B[pf]C[FM: chinese style, probably ok here];W[qc];B[rc]
;W[pc];B[rb];W[mc];B[ke]
(;W[me]C[FM: slow move. This is not the classical chinese opening - the left black group has still some defects so white don't have to play only defense here]
;B[nf]C[FM: nice move];W[mf];B[mg]
(;W[lf]TR[mf][mg]C[FM: Submissive move, making a bad shape and minimal attack on black. If you wanted to play this shape, it was better without the marked exchange.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[hd];W[ql]C[FM: the last big point on the board, but I think black is a bit ahead now.]
;B[jg]LB[lb:A]C[FM: It's very hard to say if this move is good or not. Black profit from this move is not so great and by playing here, black forces white to take the huge point of L18. Black should probably play elsewhere and then decide to play this or A.]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[lb];B[rj]
(;W[ol]LB[ej:A]TR[rj]C[FM: the marked exchange was an excellent kikashi for black, letting him to have the control over the game by having sente. Although this move is locally quite strong, I still prefer playing at A - this move is just what black wanted.]
;B[pr]CR[ko][kq]LB[dl:D][mo:E][oq:C][qq:B][or:A]TR[ol]SQ[qo]
[mq][pq]C["classical" shape...
(LL)

FM: very sharp move, requires a lot of reading before being played. Although there might be some tricks, your variations show black can be killed quite easily, also because of the triangled stone.
Playing D and letting the possibility of E was good enough.]

(;W[or]LB[oq:A][qq:B]C[the most severe continuation ???

(LL)

FM: true, black cannot capture the white stones. Still there was some bad aji in the corner and this move is pretty big, though A is more important now.]

[co:B]
(;W[dk]C[FM: good];B[el];W[fj]LB[eh:A][ek:B]C[FM: this jump looks natural, but when playing a move like this it is important to have prepared some plan to deal with things like A. If there is no plan, it is usualy better to play solid and just once push at B]

FM: this is kind of position you can play very efficiently on dragon go server as you have much much time. The position is quite complicated now and in the tournament game I would probably play the safe way of A as the points difference if white lives like this or with A first is not very big.]

[me][ol][pp]SQ[lf][dh][bo]C[FM: very nice tesuji, I don't know if I would be able to find it in a game. Unfortunately not big enough to win this game.

This game was quite nice, without any really big mistakes, which made it also quite hard to comment. I marked some moves you can improve in your future games quite easily - the square marked ones - in the lower left the common shape is on C5, on the left side always think about all the moves and in the upper right the empty triangle is almost never good.
The triangled moves are the ones which cost you the game I think. After the two slow N15 and P8 moves, black developed more quickly and got the upper hand. After that the Q4 and M17 moves were the opportunities, though they might be a bit difficult to find.

I hope you enjoyed my thoughts and wish you many nice games
