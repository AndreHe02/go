TM[900]KM[0.5];B[pd]C[To summarize, you open fine.  Only minor
comments.  You do extremely well in the first fight. However, your willingness
to start fights you don't need, and then the pursuit of those fights to the
point you MUST win is the primary weakness in this game.  Attack to make
territory or influence--not to kill.  I'm working on this myself.
...];W[dp]C[
 JamesL 23k*: have a good game :)];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd];W[jp]C[I have seen this
double-sanrensei--even in pro games.  A knight's approach from the outside
against one of Black's corners is more common.];B[pj]C[
 gipson 22k*: traditional so far];W[cf]C[
 JamesL 23k*: i only know 1 fuseki ;)];B[ch];W[ef]L[cc][dh]C[The corner point [a\] seems more
common, but this move is hard to resist in the face of the big black moyo.  [b\] is another possibility.]
;B[fd]
(;W[eh]L[di]C[
 gipson 22k*: I don't even know one. Though I practise it a lot

 This cap is not usual.  See previous variation for joseki invoving the
shoulder-hit at [a\]];B[cn];W[cj]L[di]C[
 JamesL 23k*: i can relate to that

 This 'feels' good.  A loose pincer on Black's approach stone, and a
restriction on black's original pincer stone.  The heat on the white group is
cooling.

 However, Black [a\] may be of concern.];B[cq]L[fq][fp]C[Not sure why Black
would enter the corner so quickly.  More common reply to a wide pincer is to
make a 2nd approach at [a\] or [b\] to further attach the corner
stone.]
(;W[dq]C[This is fine.  Hard to say which side is
better.  The proverb says to block on the widest side, and the distance to the
marked stones is equal.  However, I feel that the extra 3 stones on the right
side make it bigger, and I would block on the other side (see variation
previous move)];B[cp];W[en]C[Emphasizing moyo potential of lower
side. Good.];B[do];W[eo];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[pf]L[pm]C[This is okay, but not my style.  I think the high
approach is good to make it a little harder for black to make a wall in
center.  [a\] and the further moyo and territory potential it has is my
preference.];B[nc]L[nd][qe][pm]M[pj]C[This just feels too passive.  With the marked
stone in place, Black should attack the marked stone more vigorously.  [a\]
would even be better than this.  [b\] to attack base, or transpose to knight's
approach stuff is how I would play. If White moves toward the marked stone, it
still has room to extend at
[c\].];W[pi]L[pm][pl]C[Attaching like this is a
defensive move.  The lone black stone is attackable. You want to play away
from the stone you want to attack.  But, if you feel on the defensive, this is
fine.  I'd rather attach to the stong corner position to be defensive, which
would build strenght to attack the black stone with [a\] or maybe even
[b\].];B[oi]C[We have now started what becomes a big fight, so we are
out of the opening.  The big point of [a\] is the last, which has been
mentioned already  I'll continue to comment where I see I can.

 Good luck in your future games.]
(;W[oj]C[To me, crosscuts like this
are often sacrifice manuvers.  There's enough space that this seems overly
complicated.  I'll look at another line in the variation on previous
move.];B[nj];W[ok];B[ph];W[qi];B[qh];W[ni];B[oh];W[qj]C[Note the similarity to one of
the other positions I looked at?  but more
complex.];B[pk];W[pl];B[nk];W[ol];B[mi];W[nf]L[nl]C[This is going to be a hard road.  Black will gain a
bunch from attacking these guys now.  I think pushing at [a\] and building the
bottom might be better.  Just not sure what to do with the marked stone.
Still, this is okay, just a more fighting style than I
have.];B[lf]C[Now it is time to make
life.]
(;W[nh]M[oi][oh][ph][qh]L[qf][qd][od][rf][rh]C[very risky.  You
are betting on killing the marked black stones.  This is unlikely, as he can
connect at [a\]  and it is just not a good plan to try an kill things. I would
have tried attaching at [b\] or [c\] or threaten to connect at [e\] by jumping
to [d\].

 I'll tinker a bit in the variations on previous
move.];B[ng];W[mh];B[lh];W[mg];B[mf];W[og];B[lg];W[ng]C[See how black has gained an
advatange, soldified the surroundings, and white still has no goo
shape?];B[ri];W[rj];B[qf]C[And now black gets away with  this connecting move, and white
can kiss off his stones.];W[qe];B[pg]C[!?! Black gives up a liberty for his
group!];W[rh];B[di];W[li]L[dj][ei][bh]M[cj]C[This cut seems premature.  You
have enough lead and opportunity without starting another fight.  Perhaps make
it as a forcing move, then play elswhere.

 [a\] to push out with eyes on connecting at [c\] is one possibility.  [b\] to
push and sacrifice the marked stone will build a wall for the cutting stone to
run to.];B[mj];W[lj]C[Pressing this now is
risky.  You have a lead, no need to push it with this kind of a fight.]
;B[nl]C[This is a point white really wanted to have.  Okay if black
lives, but now that white has lost this point, he's already invested more in
this fight than I would recommend.];W[nm]L[om]C[See how black's push
created this cutting point at
[a\]?];B[lk];W[ml];B[mk]
(;W[kk]C[Still trying to
kill.  It is always a bit ambitious to kill something. Attack to form
territory or to form influence, but not to kill. pushing at [a\] starts to
form territory on a big scale. see variation previous
move.];B[ll];W[kl];B[lm];W[km];B[ln];W[mm];B[kj];W[ki];B[jj];W[ji];B[ij]
;W[ii];B[kn];W[il];B[om]C[Ouch.  There it is.  This fight now controls the game.  White was ahead, and may
still win, but now he must again work for it. He gave up an advantaged
position.];W[nn];B[lp];W[np];B[mo];W[no];B[jm];W[jl];B[jo];W[kp]C[
 This feels like black can get around these stones.  I'd rather pull back in
the other direction.  See how the blood-lust can make you play?

comments.

 You are too blood-thirsty :)  I am always working on this in my game.  Trying
too hard to kill something leaves you over-extended when it finally lives.  Use an attack to make territory.  Threaten to kill, but don't invest so much
or play in a way that the game depends on killing.  Living is much easier than
killing.  Live first, then you are more free to attack without fear.
