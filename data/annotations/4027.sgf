Reviewer: I'm just looking for an overall review of my play (Black) in the beginning, middle and end. I have only been playing for a few days and am studying constantly including reading the Learn to Play Go series as well as "The Second Book of Go". I understand the fundamentals but seem to really lose it somewhere in each game and am trying to pinpoint where I should be focusing and strengthening for the next games. I do realize I have only been playing for a short while and need practice more than anything but guidance in some of these areas would really help.

Any help you can provide would be great. Thanks!];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[dp];W[pc];B[pj]C[playing here rather than at K4 to make san ren sai is OK, but in some way it does not go far enough, plating Q15 would use the direction of play and power inherent in a stone at the Q4 star point.]
;W[dj];B[jd]C[7 dives in and breaks up white's spheres of influence, but also creates 2 potentially weak groups for black - D4 and K16]
;W[jp]C[white 8 maintains a near symmetric position - so all is still fairly well balanced]
;B[pe]C[Black 7 is a long way from Black 9 so one might anticipate a white play at n16 to split B7 from B9 and thus put B7 under pressure.]
;W[qe];B[qg];W[pf];B[qf];W[pd];B[oe];W[re];B[rf]C[B17 - the empty triangle B11,B13,B17 is not good shape. It leaves open the possibility of white at r12.]

(;W[sf];B[sg];W[se];B[nd]C[black 21 leaves open the peep at s12 later on, and open opssibility of a white attack at m16 or h16 (more submissive)]
;W[nc];B[mc];W[nb];B[oc];W[ob];B[mb];W[od]C[The L shape W10, W16, W20, W18 is ripe for attack]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[qb];W[pb];B[rb];W[ne];B[of];W[md]
;B[kc]C[Running 7 out by playing 39 at k14 looks better, or playing at o14 to build thickness and reduce white's potential to run out are moves to consider.]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[ng];B[sc]C[43 at r 12 a possibility];W[og];B[nj]
;W[nf];B[sd];W[qh];B[rh];W[ri];B[sh];W[qj]C[B5 and B45 are now floating in free space, white likely to take rt side.]
;B[oh];W[oi];B[nh];W[ni];B[mh];W[oj];B[pi];W[qi];B[pk];W[qk]
;B[ok];W[ql];B[mi];W[ol];B[qn];W[rm];B[rn];W[sm];B[qm];W[rl]
;B[mp];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[rq];W[nr]C[80 at o3 to put black 77 in atari would be better - so black was let off lightly.]
;B[rr]C[81 takes away eye space];W[qr];B[qs];W[pr];B[mr];W[np]
;B[nq];W[op];B[mq];W[mo];B[lp]C[91 at o5 would be possible]
;W[lo];B[ns];W[kq];B[fq]C[95 at j3 would make things difficult for white]
;W[lr];B[os];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cr];W[do];B[cn]
;W[bn];B[bq];W[bp];B[dn];W[br];B[eo]C[98 through 109 not a standard joseki.]

;W[ia];B[cc];W[ga];B[bb];W[ea];B[kd];W[bd];B[cd]C[149 at b17 for life]
;W[ce];B[bc];W[be];B[ac]C[153 was not necessary - if white at a17 then black at a18 and life, so black should play l14 or j15 to get B17,31,7,47,39,21,19,27,15,23 out of danger - loosing such a large group would tend to put Black at a big loss.]
;W[ad]C[white 154 very yose white at l14 would do much more damage]
;B[ba];W[cs];B[eq];W[je];B[ke];W[kf];B[jf];W[ie];B[kg];W[lf]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[fe];W[ff];B[hf];W[ee];B[ig]C[black is being chased to the centre with no area. The black group 105,109,101, 11, 3,99,57,95 is still weak. General problem seems tyo be weak groups.]
;W[le];B[if];W[ge];B[lg];W[jb];B[ka];W[jc]C[white 78 unnecessary - black has only 1 eye.]
;B[ja];W[ic];B[lh];W[hh];B[ih];W[ii];B[hi];W[gh];B[jg]C[187 at k11 more useful?]
;W[gi];B[hj];W[gj];B[hk];W[gk];B[hl];W[gl];B[hm];W[jn]C[black's push to 195 creates white strength with little recompense for black.]
;B[hn];W[io];B[gn];W[fm]C[now black 199 connects to stones in bottom left Blac should consider n7 or o8 to put pressure on white and make white's 96,98,8,94, 96, 92,90 look for life.]
;B[go];W[hq];B[fo];W[ir];B[ij]C[sequence to 203 gave life to white easily. 205 is small - o8 still crying out to be played.]
