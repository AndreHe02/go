C[Daedin: Hello. I am Daedin and play with Black in this game.
Daedin: I got beaten pretty severely, and my impression during the whole game was that I kept on losing territory little by little, as though I was playing a handicap game.

Daedin: I tried to add anything I found relevant, but please add any comment you find might be useful for me.

Daedin: Thank you for your time

i: Hello Daedin, I will try to review although I am not very strong.  My comments through the game are marked with "i:", like this one, and I will probably add some variations.

(;B[kj]C[Daedin: My first time playing against a middle-board opening.

Daedin: I felt bad about white having J10 and L10

i: I feel it is not so bad.  But the main thing is to play a game you are comfortable with.

If opponent played J10 and you are not expecting it, you could carry on in a normal way with Q4, or try to play a more adaptive, responsive style with M10.

There is some kind of attitude in Go of either doing your own thing or following what your opponent is doing.

I personally am more likely to ignore and do my own thing, so I probably lose games from failing to adapt to changing situations.  In this game, it looks to me like you are letting your opponent lead the game too much, and not doing your own thing when necessary.]

(;W[re]LB[qe:B][re:A]
(;B[qd]C[i: I am not familiar with joseki here, but S16 is what I would play.  I think the result is slightly better.

In this case I think w will play S17, not immediately of course, but in yose.]
;W[rd];B[rc]C[Daedin: Here I did not feel that White gained anything compared to the stantard joseki (he has lost the possibility to cut through Black two stones later on).

i: I have no opinion on move 10, but I feel 11 and 12 were both small mistakes.  However, my familiarity with joseki is extremely weak.  This is just my opinion.]
;W[po]TR[qh][qi]C[i: There is a great weakness at R13 in white's shape.  I think a kikashi loses nothing for b, and puts the white group under some attack.

Again, here I think it is at least worth considering:

Instead of "how do I respond to w move at Q5?" ask "What did w ignore, what aji can I exploit at the local situation without regarding Q5 as sente?".

In other words, the first issue is whether your opponent made a mistake already by tenuki.

Perhaps you can play some moves around the triangled region, and after attacking that, build a group and negate any possibility of territory on the right side for w.

R14 group is a group, it is vulnerable to attack.

Q5 is a stone, w can do anything with it.  So maybe best to attack the group first, w cannot afford to ignore, and then worry about Q5.]

(;B[ql]LB[ql:A][pm:B]C[Daedin: After I played this move I felt that it was a mistake, because I did not have any really good answer to White R10 or R11. Maybe a higher pincer would have been better ?

i: My answer to this is on the previous move 14.

If you play Q7 I feel w will answer at Q9 and you are no better off.]

;W[pk]C[i: Q8 here works just as well.  The P10 stones are not important.]

(;B[ok]LB[ok:A][pl:B];W[pl]C[i: ouch];B[pm];W[pn]C[i: I wonder if R7 is possible... but after allowing w Q8 I think it is impossible for b to get a favorable result on the right side.]

;B[mo];W[nn];B[mn];W[nm];B[nh];W[og];B[mi]C[Daedin: Up to there, I feel that Black is doing ok

i: B got some outside thickness towards the center, a good top right corner, good bottom right corner, although with some weaknesses.

W did not very much on the right side, and has sente.

I agree B has a good position.];W[nf]C[i: In this position, I will cut 100 times out of 100.  Maybe a stronger player will say this move is wrong, but for me, O13 is unquestionable, really the only move.

Maybe I missed some tesuji, but it looks safe.  I would be interested to know why you did not play it, maybe it is a difference of our style, but for me, O14 is an unreasonable move, and O13 begs to be played.]

(;B[nd]LB[nd:A][ng:B];W[md]C[i: Again, I find this w move a bit absurd.  I will play O13 again without hesitation.  Maybe this is just a limitation of my style, but I see no real alternative to simple, aggressive, severe, O13.  All b groups in this area are sufficiently strong.  W put two stones all alone, all you have to do is cut them off.]

(;B[mc]LB[mc:A][me:B]C[Daedin: Maybe cutting more aggressively would have been better. Here White settles easily while gaining outward influence

i: Yes, and your P11 stones still have 0 eyes so I think this is too good for W.]

(;B[ip]LB[dn:B][ip:A]TR[mn][mo][np]C[Daedin: Is simply jumping to D6 better ?

i: I am not strong enough to say.  I think this is not unreasonable.  H3 here is my first instinct because of the marked stones.]
;W[dn];B[fp]C[i: I dislike this move here.  What about E5 instead?

Reasoning: if you want to attack F3 (the only purpose of J4 after all) then this induces G4 after which F3 is strengthened, b has bad shape, and D6 is in no danger.  E5 seems ok.]
;W[gp];B[fo]C[Daedin: Again, a more aggressive play at G3 may be better ? I did not really know what to answer, with the D6 stone

i: F4 was the mistake (it often is) not F5, in my opinion.]
;W[eq];B[dq]TR[ep]C[i: I don't know if this is possible, I think D5 is probably more safe with D6 present.  See variation.]

(;B[do]LB[do:A][iq:B];W[iq];B[jp]C[i: K3 looks better to me.]
;W[kq];B[lp];W[mq];B[nq];W[mr];B[mp]C[Daedin: Black lost a lot of territory there while gaining nothing

i: Yes.  This result is why I think H3 is better than J4.  This N4 move also feels incredibly slow.]
;W[cn];B[dj]LB[ck:A]C[Daedin: I felt like it was the idea to try and deprive the White group friom its base to chase if toward the center. Maybe better at A ?

i: I don't know.  D10 is fine to me.];W[ho]
(;B[en]C[i: E7 looks much better shape.];W[em];B[fm];W[el];B[cl]
LB[fl:A]C[Daedin: Pushing at A better ?

i: Well, the question is, if w plays at A on next move, will you cut?  This is what I mean about sticking to your idea vs. following your opponent.  If you are going to ignore w 94 at A and play the cut, then this move is better than A.  If you are going to answer A and give w time to protect the cut, then A was better.]

(;B[gm]C[i: So here you invalidate your previous move at C8.  See the variation for the alternative.]

(;B[di]C[i: This move must be at C13 instead.  See var.];W[cg]
;B[cj];W[dd]C[Daedin: Again, Black lost a lot here

i: Actually, w got a really remarkable result here.  So good that I feel b has no chance of winning.  With a floating group with zero eyes, w got the big move in the corner, the bottom was a bad result for b, and the lower left corner is no points.  I don't see how b can win after D11.]

;W[bo];B[ap];W[cq];B[cp];W[hl]C[Daedin: The acutal game showed that it is not possible to kill white at this moment. Maybe black should just attack at the top ?

(;B[jd];W[oe]C[Daedin: Black resigned here.

So playing the cut is not unreasonable.  However, playing at A instead of at C8 on move 93 is perhaps better still, but once you played move 93 at C8 then w plays F8, you must cut and follow through on your original idea.  Otherwise, your opponent is determining the course of the game and you are making only hollow threats.]
