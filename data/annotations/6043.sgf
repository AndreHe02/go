C[F: Black started the game well, but around move 60 lost more or less the focus of the game. and let white come back. Since white played a better endgame, the difference at the end of the game became rather big.]
;B[dp]C[tchan54 [8k\]: hi, have fun
samoz3 [9k\]: hi];W[pd];B[qp];W[dc];B[kq]C[I'm interested, should I possibly have approached the upper left stone instead of playing L3?

F: This is OK. It's called the Chinese fuseki (opening). If you're interested to find more out about it, you can find much information on it in books or on the net.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[bp]
(;B[de]C[Correct response? Or should I have focused on stabilizing the lower left some more? Or maybe even protecting my own corner in the bottom right?

F: This is possible, because your lower side isn't weak, but you could also finish the joseki and keep sente. See variation]
;W[dh]
(;B[cg]MA[ch]C[I'm not really good at knowing how to respond to pincers... Would an extension towards the center have been better?

F: This is not so good. If white blocks on C12 (X), your two stones are cramped between white stones on two sides.  Extension toward the center is generaly a better idea. See variation]
;W[fd]C[F: Blocking on C12 would have been better];B[ch]C[F: Now black can make a base on the left side and ruine whites perspectives there]
;W[ci]
(;B[fe]C[F: This is not good. Black should cut. See variation]
;W[gd]C[F: This helps white];B[eg]C[F: Still the cut is much better. It stabilises black.]
;W[dj]C[F: Now black has a weak group, and white made some territory on the left side.]
;B[oq];W[hq];B[hp];W[gp];B[gq];W[go];B[ho];W[hn];B[iq];W[hr]
;B[ip];W[fn];B[jj]LB[qf:a][nc:b][pj:c]C[F: I don't know the intention of this move, but it's a little bit early to reduce whites moyo on the left side. There are bigger moves like a, b or c.]

[dk][al][bl][cl][dl][am][bm][cm][bn][an][ao][ap]C[F: This and the nexe move are not good. Let's have a look at the situation. 

Black has about 55 points (squares)
For white I count 37 points

So the game is good for black at this moment. He should do two things: take care of his left groupt, which is still weak, and prevent white to make too many points at the upperside
This move doesn't really attack the white stones below, and it doesn't really strengthen the black stones on the right (which are strond enough)]
;W[nj]
(;B[nf]C[Mistake?
F: See comments on last black move.  Some suggestions in the variations]
;W[lc]
(;B[je]C[F: Black should stille invade the upper side. The gap between G16 and M17 is still big. See variations]
;W[ic]C[F: Black has given white some 20 points on the upperside]

(;B[he]C[F: This only connects. See variation];W[cd]C[F: Another big move for white]
;B[ce];W[bd]
(;B[be]C[F: Very small, black should at least try to make something out of the centre. See variation.]
;W[cq]C[F: Big move for white again.];B[dq];W[do];B[gr]C[F: Not necessary]
;W[fj]C[F: Expands whites moyo and reduces the black centre]

[fs][fr][bf][cf][hg][ig][jg][jh][ih][hh]C[F: The rest of the game is more or less endgame. Since move 60, white got all the big moves, black none. So the (little) advantage black had is turned around in a lead for white. 
60 points for white, 59 for black.];B[hi];W[le];B[lf];W[ke]

(;B[mf];W[ki];B[hl];W[gl];B[jd]C[I know this was a bad move, not worth many points
F: But absolutely sente. White can't afford to ignore this. And a move from white here would be sente for him, so this move is good for black.]
