C[DMD: Hello JanneJ, I´m David (DMD on KGS) and will try to review your game. As I´m only 14 Kyu on KGS, my advices should be listened to with circonspection. Feel free to send me questions or comments to david.doret@orangemail.ch. Also, as this is my first review please excuse me if it doesn't answer your questions properly. I tried to do what I can with the basic knowledge I have. I wrote a final conclusion for you at the end of the game.]
;B[pp]C[DMD: As you won this game by an enormous margin, it will be less interesting for review. The most interesting games would be tight games and particularly those you lost, as these will reveal your weakest points.]
;W[cd];B[pe];W[dq];B[fp];W[co];B[qn]LB[fp:A]C[DMD: This is nice. But personaly, I would first take care of A to avoid a pincer (see variation).]

(;W[pc];B[qg];W[nd];B[me]C[DMD: This 2 point extension looks weak to me. If White wasn't that timid, she may have cut. See variation.]

(;W[md];B[le]
(;W[oe]C[DMD: White 14 is a mistake. it helps Black build a thick wall and acomplishes nothing. Instead of helping Black, White should invade Black's emerging moyo from the inside: there is plenty of space.]
;B[of];W[ec];B[kd]
(;W[kc]C[DMD: Instead of that, White is helping Black to build a fantastic wall.]

(;B[lc]C[DMD: This looks greedy to me. Black is trying to fight for a few points along the side when there are gigantic points that require attention. See variation.]

(;W[mc]TR[md][nd]C[DMD: This White move is awful, it produces an empty triangle and helps Black to invade further.]
;B[lb];W[jc];B[ld]C[DMD: This sequence was played in a submissive way by White who ends up very weak. The game is not yet over but Black has a good lead already.]
;W[qe];B[ne];W[od];B[qf];W[pd];B[re];W[qd];B[og];W[rd]
(;B[sf]C[DMD: This is only worth a few points. But worse, it is gote and it is not necesary to protect your territory. Instead, you should play a big move. See variation.]

(;W[nq]C[DMD: Good, White starts to do something about Black's moyo.]
;B[mp]C[DMD: 2 points extensions are certainly good moves but may be cut easily. In this game, you were obiously a few stones stronger than White and thus White did not punishe your weak moves. The stronger your opponents will become, the more severe they will be with your moves.]

(;W[mq];B[lp];W[lq]C[DMD: White is pushing from behind. This is submissive.]

(;B[kq]LB[lp:A][mp:B][kq:C]C[DMD: Your two stones A & B are too weak to play the hane at C now.  But White was gentle with you and you ended up alright.]

(;W[kr];B[jq];W[jr];B[ir]C[DMD: Your wall is composed of 2 stones groups. This is very weak and if White had been a bit stronger, she would have cut it into pieces. See some example variations.]

(;W[pq];B[op];W[qq];B[oq];W[or];B[np];W[nr];B[ip]
(;W[ro]C[DMD: Here, White should look at the Go-Ban and realise that it is not the proper time to grasp a few points in the corner. The evident problem is Black enormous center moyo. It's an emergency that requires immediate attention (in fact it is pretty much too late already). See variations for a few ideas.]
;B[rn];W[qp];B[qo]
(;W[rp]C[DMD: Who cares about defending maybe 3 points in gote when reducing or invading Black center moyo may be worth ten times more points?]

(;B[js]C[DMD: This is worth a nickel... White is unconditionally alive. See variation.]
;W[ls];B[dm]C[DMD: Good. Your moyo is now nearly as big as the Go-Ban ;-)]

(;W[cm]C[JanneJ: What should black have done here ?]
(;B[cl]C[DMD: I think this is a Bad idea. Your only territory is in the center and you are leading the game. You should thus play defensive moves. This hane means: I want to fight along the side.]

(;W[dl];B[cn];W[bm];B[bn];W[dn];B[em];W[bo];B[en];W[do];B[bl]
;W[an];B[dk]C[DMD: You were lucky, White decided to save two stones on the side and let you go with a 100 points of central territory in exchange ;-)]
;W[cg]
(;B[ci]C[DMD: Wrong direction. Your territory is not along the side.]

(;W[kh]C[DMD: If I were White, I would make one point extensions. It would be more solid as Black is very strong, here.]
;B[jh];W[jg];B[kg];W[lg];B[kf];W[lh]TR[lg][kh]C[DMD: The probability for White's triangle group to stay alive is near to zero in such an environment.]

[fs]C[DMD: Conclusion:
1). Your destruction of the lower left corner should not have worked. White has made some unforgievable mistakes. If she had answered properly, it would have changed the score by something like 50 points.
 Nevertheless, you would have won the game anyway so it was a crude to play after White passed two times. ;-)
2). Creating one big central territory may be a very good strategy and you played it here very well. Nevertheless, you should pay attention to the fact that against a stronger player, it would not be that easy. You left behind you many cutting points building up weak walls. It is far much better to give a few points to your opponent along the side to protect a central moyo.

I wish you great progresses and see you perhaps one of these days on KGS, I'm "DMD" there.]
