 realtek 5k*: osman hi thx
 realtek 5k*: i'm in taiwan
 osman 3k*: wow neat !  it's morning, in 20's (fahrenheit ) here but sunny]
;W[hp]C[reid: h4 is unorthodox, but it seems playable in a handicap game.]
;B[ce]C[reid: here I think I'd rather see black respond to white's h4.
      Even though h4 isn't much of an attack, d4 is more under
      attack than d17 is.  Perhaps black d6 or c6 would work well here.]
;W[hn]C[
 realtek 5k*: net lag 2 long here
reid: Also highly unorthodox, and not really playable, I think :-)
      The general principle is to play corners first, sides second,
      and the center last, so h6 isn't really an important point        to be playing so soon]
;B[jc]C[
 osman 3k*: what time is it exactly
 realtek 5k*: its PM 9 here
reid:  This might give white a chance to make h6 be a good move.
       It seems to me that k17 isn't really addressing either
       the moyo white is building, or a white attack at d6.];W[lq]L[dn]
[pq][ph]C[reid:  This feels a bit awkward to me.  The relation between
       m3 and q5 is rather poor.  White d6 (to start a fight),
       q3 (to build the moyo and take the corner), or something
       around q12 (to build the moyo on the largest possible
       scale and to lead towards w o16) all seem like better
       choices to me.];B[pq]C[
 osman 3k*: strange, off by nonexact number of hours
 osman 3k*: it's 8:25 here
reid:  Black can certainly invade this corner now, but he
       doesn't need to rush in so soon, either.  Playing
       at c/d6 or q/r 10 would also be fine (and a bit more
       consistant).]
(;W[qf]C[reid: Black has just invaded white's sphere of  influence.
      I think white should take his profit now.  Another
      general principal of go is the fight when you have the
      advantage (and avoid fighting where you are at a        disadvantage).  In the lower right, w has a two to one
      numerical advantage in stones.  If he lets b play first
      here, the advantage becomes 1-1, a significant decrease.
      My strategy would be to force black to live in the corner
      here while I build strength in sente, then to play r/q 14
      (or perhaps r/q 13/12 to make sure he doesn't invade).  Perhaps
      white could try for the variation here.];B[nd]C[reid:  This might be a good  time for the pincer. See variation.]

(;W[pj];B[ck]C[reid: Closer to the  lower left corner (like c6 or c7)
      would make it a bit harder for white to invade.];W[cm]C[reid: When  invading a high/low position like black
      d4-c9, it's usually best to be closer to the
      high stone, d4 in this case.  I think c6 would
      work a bit better than c7.  One way to think
      about this is that c9 is stronger (since it's on
      the third line) than d4.  A very important go
      proverb is: "Play away from strength", or to turn
      it around, play closer to the weaker.  In this
      position, d4 looks weaker.];B[ek];W[fq]C[reid: white seems to be  abandoning c7 with this
      move.  Just running out with a move around
      e7 seems more natural.  F7 is too close to
      h4/6.  Again, play away from strength.];B[eo]C[reid: At the risk of  getting repetitive, e5 should
      be closer to the weaker.  Instead of trying to
      but into the over-strong position of w f3-h4-h6,
      b should just surround the weak white c7 with
      d6 or e6.];W[ec]C[reid: w should take advantage of b's mistake and come
      out at e7.  After w e7, it looks like white has
      the numerical advantage in the corner fight.];B[eb];W[db];B[cb];W
[dd];B[cc];W[fb];B[da];W[ge]C[reid: a standard "light" sequence for w here.]
;B[gc];W[hc]C[reid: h17 looks good.  f17 is too heavy, of course.];B[hd]
;W[oc]C[reid: white seems to be having trouble
      making up his mind :-)];B[od];W[ic]C[reid: This looks like a dangerous  move to me.
      Continuing the light play with j16
      might be better.  Or sacrificing h17
      by cutting at g16 might work too.];B[id]C[reid: Hmm, I think b g18  would be more severe here.
      If white cuts at g16 (after b g18), then j16
      would be terrible for w.  Therefore, w will
      probably want to come out at j16 instead of
      cutting at g16.  B can respond to j16 by coming
      leading white out with h15.  Black probably        doesn't mind white getting strong in this area
      since he already answered p17 firmly with p16.];W[jb];B[jd]C[reid:  Still not too late for b g18 (instead of k16).]
;W[kb];B[nc]C[reid: B n18  would be more difficult for white to deal with.
      This is one case where "closer to the weaker" doesn't
      apply.  The reason it doesn't is because p17 is *too*
      weak already.  N18 is a vital spot for the eye shape
      of the k18 group.];W[gb];B[fc];W[ed];B[gd];W[ef];B[dg];W[ld]C[reid: If  b were on n18 now, white would be in trouble.
      At the very least, b would be able to solidify
      his outside wall in sente, leaving the e14
      stones in a terrible jam.];B[le];W[mb];B[nb]C[reid: The clamp at m17  looks much bigger to me.  Blocking
      with o18 is really small when you consider that
      white can still play s16.  If you are undercut on
      both sides, it's pretty hard to keep any territory.
      On the other hand, if b makes his outside wall solid,
      the e14 stones will suffer greatly.];W[me];B[lc];W[kc];B[kd];W[md]
;B[mc];W[lf]
(;B[ke]C[reid: Woah! Doesn't black want to kill white?  I know
      the pon-nuki is supposed to be worth 30 points,
      but it doesn;t seem to be that big in this case,
      and killing white *is* worth 30 points.  See
      variation.];W[lb];B[mf];W[ne];B[nf];W[gg];B[fh]C[reid: This is too small.  Black is only getting a little bit
      more territory around e11 than he was already getting.
      Better to attack on a large scale, with G11. Even better
      would be to pre-empt white's attack on the corner with
      e7.  And even better would be to settle the lower right
      with r5, o3, or n3.  P5 might also be possible.];W[hh];B[gi]C[reid:  Still too small for b.  These stones aren't contributing
      much to black's overall board position, but with each move
      by white, the g13 group is getting stronger.  It seems
      to me that the weak white group is a resource for black,
      but that by playing this way, he isn't getting his maximum
      potential from that resource.];W[ph]C[reid: This move seems to miss the  point somewhat.
      If white wants to re-inforce here, then q13
      would be sente, at least.  But the center
      stones are still too weak for white to play
      this kind of gote move.];B[nj]L[ij]C[reid: This move doesn't seem  to have any real relation
      to the other black stones.  How about chasing the
      center stones some more with j10?  They probably
      won't die, but by the time the chase is over,
      white won't have much center moyo left.];W[cf];B[df];W[cg]C[reid: Where  did this come from?  This should have
      no hope of living.  It should only help black
      get strong on the outside.];B[be];W[dh];B[eh];W[dj];B[ci]C[reid: Well,  this looks like a vital point all right,
      but it's too soon.  Just connect at d9 and white
      should die naturally.

      The original invasion goes against the principle
      of fighting where you have an advantage, and
      avoiding fights where you're at a disadvantage.];W[dk];B[cj];W[di]
;B[ch];W[dl];B[fl]C[reid: White has a lot of trouble on his hands here. Having
      two (or more) weak groups on the board is a sure
      way to lose.];W[fm]

      demonstrates.  See variation.];W[fn];B[em];W[eg];B[de];W[el];B[en]

 realtek 5k*: how long u learned playing GO];W[hj];B[gn]C[reid: These are not  the critical stones! black
      should be trying to save the g11 stones
      since they are the cutting stones.  Perhaps
      black can play h11 instead of g6.];W[ej]C[reid: now the critical stones  (g11, etc) are captured :-(]
;B[fo]C[reid: Perhaps b could get sente here  by playing g4 instead.];W
[rp]C[reid: r3 would be more natural.  B can answer  with
      s3 and he should live easily. or he can run
      out with p5.];B[lr];W[nr];B[mr];W[nq];B[mq];W[np];B[jq];W[kq]C[

      having two weak groups split by one black group.
      This should be a classic splitting attack for black.
      White will be plagued by the black threat to pull out
      with e10.  This move will work eventually since
      b can g12 in sente first.]))

      the j16 stones.  But it doesn't look to me
      like white will be able to do that, especially

      to connect his n15 stones.  So it seems that
      that white needs to capture m15 right away...];W[ke];B[if];W[ie]C

      seems that instead of r17, w must jump out to p14,
      or try to counter-attack with o17 or o16.  Either
      way should be alright for black.  The original pincer
      at r12 will be in a nice spot for reducing white's
      right side moyo potential.]))
