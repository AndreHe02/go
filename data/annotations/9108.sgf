C[malad [10k\]: i hope so];W[cg];B[ec]C[First time I ever played this outside variation. According to Eidogo, its wrong. Do comment on whether I managed to make use of its thickness later.

Hi!

I have no ideas of josekis, so I just tell you what I would do in each situation. If you want to make thickness towards your upper right corner, the plan seems ok for me. Lets take a look how it develops.]
;W[dd];B[ed];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[ic]C[E15 is a weakness that will definitely cause trouble later. So before j17 I would somehow protect it. Or even go E15 instead of D14. If you do e15, he still has to do something and then you can jump to J13. Seems more solid.]
;W[nc]C[Too early for such a desperate invasion. There is plenty of room on the lower and right side.]
;B[lc]C[good response to keep up the pressure and make points]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[oc];B[nd];W[qk];B[qm]C[I would go for r11, its perfect extension from your 4 stones and creates moyo.]
;W[qg];B[qi]C[he leaves you place for the perfect split...]
;W[ph];B[pj];W[pk];B[oj]C[Not sure if this is the right way to approach a pincer through moves Q10-P10. Was looking for something less risky than an attachment on white's lone stone at Q9 2 moves earlier.


Its very good. He has two weak groups now and you make perfect use of your wall.]
;W[pm];B[pn];W[ok];B[nj];W[nh];B[nk]C[This is too early I think.
After n12 you have now a dangerous cut around N17. so instead o9 I would go somewhere n14. It keeps pressure on his group while building you a moyo.

Then later you can n9. No matter which group he tries to save, he will squeeze your o10 group and make it stronger.]
;W[om];B[fq]C[n16 cut is still not fixed.

Also r6 seems bigger. Gives you many points and keeps pressure. 

f3 is big, but not urgent];W[hq]C[he should not go here. c6 is solid and works with the upper group. He has already 2 weak groups. If he creates another one, one of them will surely die.]
;B[cq]C[I would split f5.

As played lets you get the corner but he will get solid and his stones will work together with the upper left stones.]
;W[dq]C[ok not as I expected.];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn]
;W[cm];B[bm]C[why this stone? d2 instead is better.];W[lq];B[dr]
;W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[jq]C[You should now close r6 even more, because your 3 stones start to look weak.

Then white must run and you can gain profit.


k3 is just a lone invader and will make things complicated.]
;W[or]C[obviously connecting is not his priority.];B[np]C[i would go p3]
;W[oq];B[op];W[pr];B[qq];W[nq];B[kp]C[trying to save this stone is too much and will weaken your position. Keep splitting the two groups instead. m4 would be better.]
;W[lp];B[ko];W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[sr];W[on];B[po];W[lo];B[jm]
;W[nl];B[ml];W[mm];B[ll]C[you both connect your weak stones.. seems a fair trade. 

But if you did not create your weak group with k3, only he would have had a weak group and you could have gone after it full power.]
;W[ho];B[eo]C[Trying to make use of the F3 stone by escaping and possibly working with M7 stone later. And if not, waste white's move to cut it off.

Before h5 just cut at d5 would be worth a try, but now this area is quite uninteresting.

Go after the o12 group, starting with n14

The cut at d5 will be maybe nice later. Now you just wasted its potential. Aji-keshi I think.]
;W[do];B[hm];W[gn];B[gm];W[en];B[fm]C[Too small. He does not have to answer this move.

I would just attack o12 and build up that moyo.

As it is, it has some painful entry points at n16 and e15.]

(;W[fn]C[ok he answers it anyway];B[cj]C[this is no mans land. a white stone here would gain him.... 5-6 points? its nothing. Attack his weak group!!!]
;W[lh]C[good move];B[jh]C[what should I think of this stone... It gains you no points, so you want to kill him with it?

He still has n16 and with m12 in place the cut becomes more dangerous than ever.

Protect the cut first, maybe indirectly with n13?];W[le]C[ N16 should be better right? With 2 points to connect and not giving Whites a chance to cut me off.]
;B[mc]C[you were right.

n16 would be much better.

now you create a heavy group of stones for nothing.]
(;W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[mg];W[mh];B[lf];W[kf];B[kg];W[lg];B[mf]
;W[jg]C[Was there anyway to save the O16 group had white played more solidly like K14?

white 94 at n14 would gain him at least a Ko I think.

As played, he gains not really much.];B[ke];W[kh];B[kd];W[ji]
;B[ih]C[This is not good. If you're not 100% sure it will kill him, don't make such moves.

Rather care for your dragon, it still has no eyes];W[je];B[lj]
C[Is this a waste of move to protect the vital point of this shape when I'm not aiming to make eyes but connect to live group?

To which group do you want to connect with this move?

I think this move is good, gives your weak dragon an eye and aims at  l11 cut.]
;W[kj];B[ii]C[heavy];W[jk];B[ij]C[???

this moves gains not so much. mutter h9 if you want to connect.]
;W[rc];B[jj]C[I realized this was useless. What other big moves are there now? Can only think of C8, J9 or S16


c8 - little points, gote
j9 - no points since he has e12, d9
s16 some points, again gote.

I would go for the sente moves first.

h2 seems interesting.

;W[ql];B[rn];W[rg];B[of]C[Think this is useless as well. Trying to gain whatever extra points I can. As well my next 2 moves. Please advise

you are right, this moves gives you 2 points or so.

Good game! You lead the whole game! Only stupid mistake in the end lets you lose.

Your early game was far better than your opponent. You tried to make your stones work together and cut his in half! But you must follow through this plan in the middle game! Before you take big moves... look for the urgent moves! They are more important!!

Middle game was a little chaotic, because you created some weak groups instead of making your lead solid.

Your opponent killed you in the end game!! Search for the sente moves! Before you place a stone, think: Why should the opponent react to my stone? Is there elsewhere he would play to gain more? Try to evaluate how many points a move gains you. this will prevent you to lose so many moves on just 1-2 points like in the upper right.

Hope my comments could help you a little! Bye bye!])
